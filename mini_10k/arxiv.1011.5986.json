The model includes markets with bidask price spreads at initial and terminal time, generated for example by proportional\ntransaction costs.

In this\npaper, we will provide the link between set-valued risk measures and super-replication\ntheorems for conical market models, the latter established for example in [14], [17].\nMoreover, new features will turn up in the random exchange rate case, most notably\nthat risk measures may not be compatible with the chosen market model. This means\nthat some risk measures may not yield all risk compensating initial positions for some\nrandom payoffs, since results of trading operations at initial and/or terminal time\naccording to the market may not be part of the acceptance set belonging to the risk\nmeasure. This could be of advantage, for example, if there is no consensus about the\nmarket model, or if one wishes to be very conservative.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, we show that compatibility with the market\nat initial time determines the image space of a set-valued risk measure, whereas compatibility with the market at terminal time turns out to be a monotonicity property.\nThis relationship has not been observed before: In [4] only scalar risk measures for\nmultivariate positions are considered without reference to a market model. In [13] and\n[10] (set-valued) risk measures for a static market are defined such that compatibility\nis automatic, whereas in [5] set-valued risk measures are investigated without reference\nto a market model.\nFinally, we shall show that even scalar risk measures with multiple eligible assets\nas proposed in [2] fit into our framework.\nThe almost natural occurrence of set-valued risk measures in market models with\nfrictions might also boost the theory of set-valued optimization problems. The authors\ndo not know any other application leading to a (primal) set-valued optimization problem: In the context of the present paper, a problem like \"minimize the (set-valued)\nrisk of a multivariate position subject to some constraints\" makes perfectly sense from\nan application point of view, and this opens the door to a all new research area.\nThe departing point is chosen similar to the one in [2]: We are given a set of\nmultivariate random variables which are specified according to the risk tolerance of a\nregulator or supervisor (in the following: regulator). This set, the regulator acceptance\nset, satisfies only minimal requirements. The regulator acceptance set is, as usual, in\none-to-one correspondence with a regulator risk measure. The investor or financial\nagent (in the following: agent) may add particular features in order to evaluate the\nrisk of a multivariate outcome of her actions. For example, she wants to (or has to)\ntake a market model into account. This leads to augmented (agent) acceptance sets\nwhich will have particular properties, and to corresponding risk measures.\n2\n\n\fThe augmentation procedure for the acceptance set as described in section 2.4 will\nshed new light on the interplay between risk specifications of a regulator and the degrees\nof freedom for agents. For example, we think it is very reasonable that a regulator need\nnot be concerned about specific market models, but just about tolerable outcomes. On\nthe other hand, the market model already is a choice of the agent. In this paper, we\nassume that the agent did choose a specific (conical) market model. If she does not feel\nsure about the model, she at least could either do a sensitivity analysis with respect\nto the market model, or just stick to the regulator risk measure. The first possibility\nis beyond the scope of this paper, but it seems to be a very interesting topic for future\nresearch. The second possibility is easily done using the results below.\nThe tools used for modeling (convex) set-valued risk measures for multivariate\nrandom variables and in particular, the duality formulas necessary to establish dual\nrepresentation results rely on the approach given in [9]. It turns out that this approach\nmatches perfectly the needs of risk measures and superhedging theorems for conical\nmarkets models. In particular, our dual variables, namely some simple set-valued\nfunctions, and the conditions they have to satisfy have a meaning in terms of the\nfinancial market model. We can hardly see how this goal could be achieved by sticking\nto a vector-valued duality theory in which usually linear operators feature as dual\nelements.\nThe main result of the paper is the dual representation theorem for convex setvalued risk measures for conical market models (theorem 4.2 below). It can be seen\nas a duality result for a set-valued optimization problem. Indeed, if one starts with a\n(closed convex) set A of acceptable random variables the risk measure corresponding\nto A is given as an infimum in a set-valued sense which here is (the closure of) a\nunion. On the other hand, the duality result produces a representation of the setvalued (proper closed convex) risk measure as a supremum of its set-valued affine\nminorants. The supremum is taken in a complete lattice of sets with respect to \"\u2287\",\nso it is an intersection.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we define regulator acceptance\nsets, describe augmentation procedures, the construction of risk measures and the oneto-one relationships between classes of set-valued risk measures and acceptance sets.\nSections 3 and 4 include the duality results. Section 5 is devoted to examples the\nmost important of which is the link between set-valued coherent risk measures and\nsuperhedging theorems for conical market models. We also include set-valued versions\nof value at risk, the worst case risk measure and average value at risk as well as a\ndiscussion of risk measures in a multiple eligible asset market. In the appendix, some\n3\n\n\ftechnical results are recalled or proven.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFrom acceptance sets to risk measures\nAcceptance sets\n\nWe are given a probability space (\u03a9, FT , P ). By L0d = L0d (\u03a9, FT , P ) we denote the\nlinear space of all P -measurable functions X : \u03a9 \u2192 IRd , and by Lpd = Lpd (\u03a9, FT , P ),\nR\n0 < p \u2264 \u221e, the linear space of all such functions with \u03a9 |X (\u03c9)|p dP < +\u221e for\n0 < p < \u221e, and ess.sup\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 |X (\u03c9)| < \u221e for p = \u221e. In all cases, |*| stands for an\narbitrary, but fixed norm on IRd , and the usual identification of functions differing only\non sets of P -measure zero is assumed. As usual, we write\n\b\n(Lpd )+ = X \u2208 Lpd : X \u2208 IRd+ P \u2212 a.s.\n\nfor the closed convex cone of IRd -valued random variables with P -almost surely nonnegative components. An element X \u2208 Lpd has components X1 , . . . , Xd in Lp = Lp1 .\nThe symbol 1I denotes the random variable in Lp1 which has P -almost surely the value\n1.\nIn this paper, for X \u2208 Lpd , the values of Xi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d, are understood as the number\nof units of asset i an agent holds at terminal time T . Thus, we follow Kabanov's idea\n[14] in assuming that a portfolio is represented in \"physical units\" of the traded assets\n(instead of its value in a fixed currency/num\u00e9raire).\nFollowing [2] we consider an acceptance set given by a regulator as the object with\n\"conceptual primacy [...] in risk measurement\".\n\nDefinition 2.1 An acceptance set is a subset A \u2286 Lpd with 0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e satisfying\nIRd 1I \u2229 A 6= \u2205, IRd 1I \u2229 (Lpd \\A) 6= \u2205 and A + (Lpd )+ \u2286 A.\nWe consider the properties in definition 2.1 as the minimal requirements to be asked\nof an acceptance set. We see them as rational in the sense that every regulator would\nagree upon them. The first two simply mean that there is a deterministic portfolio\nwhich is accepted by the regulator, but the regulator does not accept all deterministic\nportfolios. The last two properties imply a weak condition of the boundedness-from\u0001\nbelow type: There is x \u2208 IRd such that x1I \u2212 (Lpd )+ \u2229 A = \u2205. Indeed, otherwise for\neach x \u2208 IRd there would exist X \u2208 (Lpd )+ such that x1I\u2212X \u2208 A, hence x1I \u2208 X +A \u2286 A.\nThis would be IRd 1I \u2286 A contradicting IRd 1I \u2229 (Lpd \\A) 6= \u2205. Compare [8], (4.3), (4.4) for\nsimilar requirements in the univariate case.\n4\n\n\fNote that in [2] (p. 3, (iii)) a subset of L01 is called an acceptance set if its elements,\ninterpreted as \"future values of financial positions\", are \"in line with the risk tolerance\nof the supervisor\", but no mathematical assumptions are required. We deviate a little\nfrom this approach since otherwise the term \"acceptance set\" would just be tantamount\nwith \"subset of L0d \".\n\n2.2\n\nEligible portfolios\n\nA regulator usually asks for a deposit, to be made at initial time, to compensate for the\nrisk of an investment. This deposit could be given, for instance, in cash of a specific\ncurrency, cash of several currencies, units of other num\u00e9raires, or even positions with\nfixed proportions of several of such assets. The set of such positions spans a linear space\nM, the space of eligible portfolios. Without loss of generality, we assume M \u2286 IRd ,\ni.e. all eligible assets are included in the set of the \"traded\" assets. The following\ntwo conditions describe the relationship between the space of eligible portfolios and an\nacceptance set:\n(A1a) M1I \u2229 A 6= \u2205 and\n(A1b) M1I \u2229 (Lpd \\A) 6= \u2205.\n(A1a) says that there is an eligible portfolio which is acceptable at terminal time.\n(A1b) says that not every eligible portfolio is acceptable at terminal time. Of course,\n(A1a), (A1b) are stronger than the first two requirements in definition 2.1.\n\n2.3\n\nRisk measures\n\nA risk measure will turn out to be a function which maps multivariate random variables\ninto the power set P (M) of the space M of eligible portfolios (including the empty set\n\u2205). We associate with a function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M), as usual, its graph defined by\ngraph R = {(X, u) \u2208 Lpd \u00d7 M : u \u2208 R (X)} .\nDefinition 2.2 A function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is called translative in M or just Mtranslative iff\n\u2200X \u2208 Lpd , \u2200u \u2208 M : R (X + u1I) = R (X) \u2212 u.\n(2.1)\nLet B \u2286 Lpd . A function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is called B-monotone iff\n\u0001\n\u0001\nX2 \u2212 X1 \u2208 B \u21d2 R X2 \u2287 R X1 .\n\nIn the following definition, we identify risk measures among all functions into P (M).\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2.3 A risk measure is a function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) with 0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e which\nis M-translative and (Lpd )+ -monotone. A risk measure is said to be finite at zero if it\nsatisfies\n(R1a) R (0) 6= \u2205 and\n(R1b) R (0) 6= M.\nThe value R (X) of a risk measure R is understood to include the eligible portfolio\nvectors which compensate for the risk of X.\nThe interpretation of (R1a) is, of course, that there is an eligible portfolio at initial\ntime which compensates for the risk of the zero payoff at terminal time. (R1b) just\nmeans that not all eligible portfolios compensate for the risk of the zero payoff.\nThe interpretation of M-translativity is straightforward if one recalls the scalar\ncase, see [1], [2], [8].\nThe monotonicity condition says that a random portfolio vector which is componentwise not less than another in (almost) all scenarios should admit more risk compensating eligible portfolios. Therefore, the partial order \u2287 is the relation of choice in\nthe image space P (M).\nLet a set A \u2286 Lpd be given. By\nRA (X) = {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 A}\n\n(2.2)\n\na function RA : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is defined. If A is an acceptance set, then the interpretation of (2.2) is, of course, that RA (X) includes all eligible portfolios which, when\nadded to X, compensate for the risk of X, i.e. lead to an overall position in A.\nConversely, we associate with a function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) the set\nAR = {X \u2208 Lpd : 0 \u2208 R (X)} .\n\n(2.3)\n\nIf R is a risk measure, then AR includes those positions X which have zero among its\nrisk compensating eligible portfolios, i.e. a position X is acceptable in terms of the\nrisk measure R if it can be made acceptable without additional initial endowment.\nAs in the scalar case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between families of Mtranslative functions and families of subsets of Lpd via (2.2), (2.3). The following simple\nresult provides the basic relationship.\nProposition 2.4 Let A \u2286 Lpd be given. Then, the function RA is M-translative and\nA = ARA . Conversely, let R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) be M-translative. Then R = RAR .\n\n6\n\n\fProof. From (2.2), (2.3) we get\nARA = {X \u2208 Lpd : 0 \u2208 RA (X)} = {X \u2208 Lpd : 0 \u2208 {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 A}} = A\nas desired. A direct calculation using (2.2), (2.3) and (2.1) yields\nRAR (X) = {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 AR }\n= {u \u2208 M : 0 \u2208 R (X + u1I)} = R (X) .\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.5 Let A \u2286 Lpd be an acceptance set. Then, the function RA is a risk\nmeasure. If A satisfies (A1a), (A1b), then RA is finite at zero. Conversely, let R : Lpd \u2192\nP (M) be a risk measure. Then, AR is an acceptance set. If R is finite at zero, then\nAR satisfies (A1a), (A1b).\nProof. This follows from proposition 2.4 and 6.5 (a) (with B = (Lpd )+ ), (b), (c)\nin the appendix.\n\u0003\nAdditional properties may (and will) be required for acceptance sets and risk measures. Most importantly, conditions for the compatibility of the acceptance set with\nthe market model are given in the following section.\n\n2.4\n\nMarket-compatibility\n\nSo far, acceptance sets and risk measures have nothing to do with the financial market.\nThis is on purpose: The regulator should not be concerned about the question what\nmarket model \"describes the reality\". Moreover, we see the market model as a choice\nof the agent: Agents may not agree upon the model.\nOnce a market model is chosen, one can describe consequences for the acceptance\nset and the corresponding risk measure. Here, we consider a one-period, conical market\nmodel. It can be seen as the one-period special case of the conical models considered\nin [15]. Such a model may occur if proportional transaction costs are present (see [14]\nand also [13]), or a bid-ask price spread is modeled directly (see e.g. [17]).\nAt initial time, a closed convex cone KI \u2286 IRd with IRd+ \u2286 KI 6= IRd is given which\nmodels the proportional frictions between the assets according to the geometric model\nintroduced in [14]. This cone is called solvency cone since it includes precisely those\n(deterministic) portfolios which can be exchanged at initial time into portfolios with\nonly non-negative components. The part of the cone KI that is relevant for the space\n7\n\n\fM of eligible portfolios is KIM = KI \u2229 M, also a closed convex cone. It is assumed\nthroughout the paper that M \u2229 IRd+ 6= {0}. This implies in particular KIM 6= {0} since\nIRd+ \u2286 KI .\nAt terminal time, the market is described by means of a measurable mapping \u03c9 7\u2192\nKT (\u03c9), the solvency cone mapping, with KT (\u03c9) \u2286 IRd a closed convex cone such that\nIRd+ \u2286 KT (\u03c9) 6= IRd for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. For 0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the set\nLpd (KT ) = {X \u2208 Lpd : P ({\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : X (\u03c9) \u2208 KT (\u03c9)}) = 1}\n\n(2.4)\n\nis a closed convex cone in Lpd generating a reflexive transitive relation for IRd -valued\nrandom variables. We recall the following definition, see for example [3].\n\u0001\nDefinition 2.6 A set-valued function K : \u03a9 \u2192 P IRd is called measurable iff for each\nopen set B \u2286 IRd the set {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : K (\u03c9) \u2229 B 6= \u2205} is an element of FT .\nIn contrast to [10], we allow for the additional randomness expressed by the measurable set-valued function KT : It reflects the fact that the future transaction costs\nand/or exchange rates are not known at initial time. In [10], K = KI \u2261 KT is assumed\nas in [13].\nAccording to (2.2), if a financial agent is given an acceptance set and a final payoff\nX \u2208 Lpd , she is supposed to look for all eligible portfolios u \u2208 M which make the overall\nposition X + u1I acceptable. Since trading is possible at initial and terminal time, two\nsituations may occur.\nFirst, the agent might be interested to know about all eligible portfolios which can\nbe exchanged into an eligible portfolio which in turn makes a given payoff X \u2208 Lpd\nacceptable. Suppose u \u2208 M is such that u\u2032 \u2208 u \u2212 KIM makes X acceptable, that is, the\ninvestor can exchange u into u\u2032 at initial time (and stay in M) in order to get a risk\ncompensating eligible portfolio for X. Then X + u1I \u2208 A + KIM 1I, that is, the agent\nlooks for\n\b\nRA+KIM 1I (X) = u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 A + KIM 1I = RA (X) + KIM .\n\n(the reader easily verifies the last equation). From the point of view of the regulator it\ndoes not matter if the agent starts with initial endowment u or u\u2032 : If A is the acceptance\nset given by the regulator and X + u1I 6\u2208 A, then the agent has to exchange u into u\u2032\nand give u\u2032 as deposit in order to make X acceptable. For the agent, however, it could\nmake a difference since a transaction might not be desirable for her. On the other\nhand, it clearly is of advantage for the agent to know all initial endowments which \u2013\nmaybe after a transaction at initial time \u2013 admit to compensate for the risk of X.\n8\n\n\fSecondly, the agent might be interested to know what risks she could cover with a\ngiven available eligible portfolio u \u2208 M. Of course, every X \u2208 Lpd such that X +u1I \u2208 A.\nMoreover, if X + u1I 6\u2208 A, but she can exchange X for X \u2032 at terminal time such that\nX \u2032 +u1I \u2208 A, it is reasonable for her to consider u as a risk compensating portfolio for X,\ntoo: Indeed, there is no additional initial endowment necessary, but just an exchange\nfrom X to X \u2032 at time T . Since in this case X \u2032 \u2208 X \u2212 KT a.s. and X \u2032 + u1I \u2208 A we\nhave X + u1I \u2208 A + Lpd (KT ). Thus, the agent looks for\nRA+Lpd (KT ) (X) = {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 A + Lpd (KT )} .\nAgain, from the point of view of the regulator it does not matter how the agent ends\nup with a position in A. From the point of view of the agent it could make a difference:\nNot only that an exchange might not be desirable, the chosen market model could be\nwrong. In the latter case, the required exchange at terminal time could be impossible\nleaving the agent with a non-acceptable position. This certainly is a motivation for the\nagent to look at both of RA and RA+Lpd (KT ) .\nThe above considerations justify the following definition.\nDefinition 2.7 An acceptance set A is called KT -compatible iff A + Lpd (KT ) \u2286 A, and\nit is called KI -compatible iff A + KIM 1I \u2286 A.\nA risk measure is called KT -compatible iff it is Lpd (KT )-monotone, and it is called\n\b\nM\nKI -compatible iff it maps into the set PK\n= D \u2286 M : D = D + KIM .\nAn acceptance set or a risk measure is called market-compatible iff it is KI - and\nKT -compatible.\nTrivially, if A is an acceptance set, A + Lpd (KT ) is KT -compatible, A + KIM 1I is KI compatible, and A+Lpd (KT )+KIM 1I is market-compatible, and A is market-compatible\nif and only if A + Lpd (KT ) + KIM 1I = A. Of course it is of interest (and done below)\nto establish conditions under which RA (X) = RA (X) + KIM and/or RA = RA+Lpd (KT ) ,\nrespectively. The reader may note that the question wether or not a risk measure is\nmarket-compatible is a new feature in the multi-variate case which does not occur (or\nis trivial) if scalar risk measures for univariate positions are under consideration.\nProposition 2.8 Let A \u2286 Lpd be a KT -compatible (KI -compatible, market-compatible)\nacceptance set. Then, RA is a KT -compatible (KI -compatible, market-compatible) risk\nmeasure.\nConversely, let R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) be a KT -compatible (KI -compatible, market-compatible)\nrisk measure. Then, AR is a KT -compatible (KI -compatible, market-compatible) acceptance set.\n9\n\n\fProof. Follows from proposition 6.5 (a), (d).\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following simple example shows that not every \"intuitive\" acceptance set is\nmarket-compatible.\n\b\nExample 2.9 Let d = m = 2 and KI = KIM = x \u2208 IR2 : x2 \u2265 \u22122x1 , x2 \u2265 0 . For\n\b\nall \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 let KT = x \u2208 IR2 : x2 \u2265 \u2212 12 x1 , x1 \u2265 0 . The point u = (\u22121, 4) is in KI , but\nnot in KT . Let us for the moment accept positions in A = Lp2 (KT ). Then X = 0 \u2208 Lp2\nis certainly an acceptable position. However, the position X +u1I = u1I is not acceptable\ndespite the fact that u can be transferred into a \"strictly\" positive position at initial\ntime, that is A is not KI -compatible. On the other hand, of course A is KT -compatible.\nAs in the previous example, the \"intuitive\" worst case acceptance set Lpd (KT ) is\nthe standard example of a set which is KT -compatible, but not market-compatible in\ngeneral. See section 5.4 for more details.\nRemark 2.10 The set \u2212Lpd (KT )\u2212KI 1I is the set of all terminal positions which can be\ngenerated with zero initial costs, that is starting with the zero portfolio at initial time.\nA pair (u\u2032 , X \u2032 ) \u2208 IRd \u00d7Lpd satisfying u\u2032 \u2208 \u2212KI and X \u2032 \u2208 u\u2032 1I\u2212KT almost surely is called\na self-financing portfolio process for the one-period market (KI , KT ) (see [17]). Thus,\nu \u2208 M makes X \u2208 Lpd acceptable with respect to the market-compatible acceptance set\nA + Lpd (KT ) + KIM 1I if and only if there is a self-financing portfolio process (u\u2032 , X \u2032)\nsuch that u\u2032 \u2208 M and X + X \u2032 + u1I \u2208 A.\nRemark 2.11 The set A + KIM 1I satisfies (A1b) if and only if A \u2286 L0d satisfies a\ncertain boundedness from below condition with respect to the cone KIM . Indeed,\nA + KIM 1I satisfies (A1b) \u21d4 \u2203u \u2208 M : u1I 6\u2208 A + KIM 1I\n\u21d4 \u2203u \u2208 M \u2200k \u2208 KIM : (u \u2212 k) 1I 6\u2208 A\n\u0001\n\u21d4 \u2203u \u2208 M : u \u2212 KIM 1I \u2229 A = \u2205.\n\nWith a similar argument, one may verify that A \u2286 L0d satisfies (A1a) if and only if\nA + KIM 1I does.\n\n2.5\n\nDiversification and convexity issues\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that convexity is a useful property of acceptance sets and\nrisk measures. For example, the criticism against the use of value at risk as a risk\nmeasure is based on the lack of convexity.\n10\n\n\fWhile the definition of convexity for an acceptance set A \u2286 Lpd , being a subset of a\nlinear space, is the usual one, we use the following definitions for functions R : Lpd \u2192\nP (M). The reader who is familiar with [10] may observe that this approach deviates\nfrom the one in the quoted paper where only market-compatible risk measures have\nbeen considered.\nDefinition 2.12 A function R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is called convex iff\n\u2200X, X \u2032 \u2208 Lpd , \u2200t \u2208 (0, 1) : R (tX + (1 \u2212 t) X \u2032 ) \u2287 tR (X) + (1 \u2212 t) R (X \u2032 ) .\nIt is called positively homogeneous iff\n\u2200X \u2208 Lpd , \u2200t \u2208 (0, 1) : R (tX) \u2287 tR (X) ,\nand it is called subadditive iff\n\u2200X, X \u2032 \u2208 Lpd : R (X + X \u2032 ) \u2287 R (X) + R (X \u2032 ) .\nA positively homogeneous and subadditive function is called sublinear.\nThe above definition of convexity just means that the \"mixed\" position tX +\n(1 \u2212 t) X \u2032 admits at least the risk compensating eligible portfolios which could be\nobtained by mixing the ones for X and X \u2032 . Alternative characterizations of these\nproperties in terms of the graph of R can be found in the appendix, section 6.3. Moreover, the values of a convex set-valued function R are convex (choose X = X \u2032 in the\nabove definition), and R (0) is a cone if R is positively homogeneous. If R is sublinear,\nthen the convex cone R (0) is included in the recession cone of R (X) for each X since\nR (X + 0) \u2287 R (X) + R (0) for each X \u2208 Lpd .\nProposition 2.13 Let A \u2286 Lpd be an acceptance set which is convex (closed under\naddition, a cone). Then, RA is a convex (subadditive, positively homogeneous) risk\nmeasure. Conversely, let R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) be a convex (subadditive, positively homogeneous) risk measure. Then, AR is an acceptance set which is convex (closed under\naddition, a cone).\nProof. Follows from proposition 6.5 (e), (f), (g).\n\n\u0003\n\nAs usual, a sublinear risk measure is called coherent. We immediately obtain the\none-to-one correspondence between coherent risk measures (and being finite at zero)\nand acceptance set which are convex cones (and satisfying (A1a), (A1b)).\nRemark 2.14 If the acceptance set A is convex (a cone), then the market-compatible\naugmented acceptance set A + Lpd (KT ) + KIM 1I again is convex (a cone).\n11\n\n\f2.6\n\nClosedness\n\nClosedness assumptions are inevitable for convex duality results. Given an acceptance\nset A, the corresponding risk measure RA may have two different closedness properties.\nFirst, it may have closed values. Secondly, its graph may be closed. These two properties correspond to two different properties of the acceptance set A. While the one\ncorresponding to closedness of the graph is closedness of A in Lpd , the closedness property of A which corresponds to closed values of RA is more involved. In the following\n\b\nM\ndefinition, we use the symbol uk \u2212\u2192 0 in order to denote a sequence uk k\u2208IN \u2282 M\nwith limk\u2192\u221e uk = 0.\nM\n\nDefinition 2.15 A set A \u2286 Lpd is called directionally closed in M iff X \u2208 Lpd , uk \u2212\u2192 0\nand X + uk 1I \u2208 A for all k \u2208 IN imply X \u2208 A. For an arbitrary set A \u2286 Lpd , the set\nn\no\np\nk M\nk\ncl M A = X \u2208 Ld : \u2203u \u2212\u2192 0 : \u2200k \u2208 IN : X + u 1I \u2208 A\nis called the directional closure of A in M.\n\nOf course, a closed set A is directionally closed with respect to each linear subspace\nM \u2286 IRd . See the appendix for more information about this property. Note also that\na set-valued function R with a closed graph has closed values.\nProposition 2.16 Let A \u2286 Lpd be an acceptance set which is directionally closed with\nrespect to M (closed in Lpd ). Then, RA is a risk measure with closed values (a closed\ngraph). Conversely, let R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) be a risk measure with closed values (a closed\ngraph). Then, AR is an acceptance set which is directionally closed with respect to M\n(closed in Lpd ).\nProof. Follows from proposition 6.5 (i), (k).\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.17 If the acceptance set A is closed (directionally closed in M), then the\nmarket-compatible augmented acceptance set A + Lpd (KT ) + KIM 1I need not to be closed\n(directionally closed in M) in general.\nRemark 2.18 Lemma 6.2 (see appendix) makes the following construction possible.\nIf an acceptance set is not directionally closed in M (or one just does not know), then\nthe function\nX 7\u2192 cl {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 A}\n\n12\n\n\fcoincides with Rcl M A . Since cl M is a hull operator (see lemma 6.1), for each acceptance\nset B \u2286 Lpd with A \u2286 B which is directionally closed in M we have\n\u2200X \u2208 Lpd : RB (X) \u2287 Rcl M A (X) .\nSimilarly, if A is not closed (or one just does not know), then the graph of the\nfunction\nX 7\u2192 {u \u2208 M : X + u1I \u2208 cl A}\ncoincides with cl (graph RA ) (and is of course graph Rcl A ). For each M-translative\nfunction R with a closed graph including the graph of RA we have\n\u2200X \u2208 Lpd : R (X) \u2287 Rcl A (X) .\n\n3\n\nDual variables\n\nIn the next two sections, we will give dual representation results. Therefore, we shall\n1\nassume 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e in the following. In case p = \u221e we consider the dual pair (L\u221e\nd , Ld )\np\nq\n1\n1\n\u221e\n1\nwith \u03c3 (L\u221e\nd , Ld )-topology on Ld . In all other cases, Ld is paired with Ld for p + q = 1\nand their respective norm topologies.\n\u0001+\nBy KI+ and KIM\nwe denote the positive dual cones of the cones KI in IRd and\nKIM in M, respectively. Thus,\nKIM\n\n\u0001+\n\n\b\n= v \u2208 M : \u2200u \u2208 KIM : v T u \u2265 0 \u2286 M.\n\n\u0001+\n\u0001\n\b\nNote that KIM = KI+ + M \u22a5 \u2229 M with M \u22a5 = v \u2208 IRd : \u2200u \u2208 M : v T u = 0 since\n\u0001+\nKI+ + M \u22a5 is the dual cone of KIM in IRd . The reader should be aware that both KIM\nand KI+ + M \u22a5 are dual cones of KIM , the first one in M, the second one in IRd . We will\n\b\nalso use G (v) = x \u2208 IRd : 0 \u2264 v T x for v \u2208 IRd being a subset of IRd , not necessarily\none of M.\nBy KT+ we denote the set\u2013valued mapping \u03c9 7\u2192 [KT (\u03c9)]+ , and [Lpd (KT )]+ \u2286 Lqd\ndenotes the dual cone of Lpd (KT ).\nLemma 3.1\n\u0001 \b\n[Lpd (KT )]+ = Lqd KT+ = Y \u2208 Lqd : Y (\u03c9) \u2208 KT+ (\u03c9) P \u2212 a.s. .\n\n\u0001\nProof. \"\u2287\": Let Y \u2208 Lqd KT+ and X \u2208 Lpd (KT ).

In fact, this is usually the case as\nthe following example illustrates.\n\n19\n\n\f5.2\n\nThe case of one leading currency and several eligible assets\n\nIn their 2009 paper [2] the authors introduce the following generalization of scalar\nmonetary measures of risk. Assume we are given a \"leading\" (domestic) currency\n(eligible asset number 1) and a set of d \u2212 1 further eligible assets. One unit of asset\ni has the deterministic price \u03c0i > 0 at initial time (with \u03c01 = 1 and the random\nprice Si : \u03a9 \u2192 IR+ \\ {0} at terminal time, i \u2208 {1, . . . , d} (with S1 \u2261 1 while assuming\nthat money in the leading currency is invested in a risk free manner and everything\nis discounted). An eligible portfolio x = (x1 , . . . , xd ) \u2208 IRd (in \"physical\" units) has\nP\nP\nthe price di=1 \u03c0i xi at initial time and S = di=1 Si xi at terminal time. Let us further\nassume that we are given a non-empty set A1 \u2286 L01 of acceptable random payoffs in the\nleading currency (we do not call it an acceptance set since we do not require further\nproperties yet). The function\n(\n)\nd\nd\nX\nX\nSi xi \u2208 A1 , x \u2208 IRd ,\n\u03c0i xi = s , Z \u2208 L01 ,\n\u033a (Z) = inf s \u2208 IR : Z +\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ncorresponds to the risk measure of definition 2 in [2] if the set S therein has the d\nmembers described above.\nWe reformulate the above model in terms of our previous constructions. We have\nm = d, and the solvency cone at initial time is the polyhedral convex cone KI spanned\nby the d \u2212 1 vectors\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u22121, 0, . . . , 0, , 0, . . . , 0 , i = 2, . . . , d,\n\u03c0i\ntheir negatives and the vector (1, . . . , 1) \u2208 IRd . The values of the solvency cone mapping\nKT at terminal time are spanned by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u22121, 0, . . . , 0, , 0, . . . , 0 , i = 2, . . . , d,\nSi\ntheir negatives and the vector (1I, . . . , 1I) \u2208 Lpd . Both cones are closed half spaces (the\nsecond one random) with normal vectors\n(1, \u03c02 , . . . , \u03c0d ) and (1I, S2 , . . . , Sd ) ,\nb \u2286 L0 of\nrespectively. That is, we are moving in a frictionless market. Define a set A\nd\nacceptable positions by\nb\nX = (X1 , . . . , Xd ) \u2208 A\n\n20\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nd\nX\ni=1\n\nSi Xi \u2208 A1 .\n\n\fb is convex (a cone, KT -compatible) if and only if A1 is convex\nIt should be clear that A\nb is not market-compatible in general even if\n(a cone, (Lp1 )+ -compatible). However, A\nA1 is an acceptance set in Lp1 . For a random payoff X1 : \u03a9 \u2192 IR and u \u2208 IRd we have\n\nThe collection\n\nb\n(X1 , 0, . . . , 0) + u1I \u2208 A\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nX1 +\n\nd\nX\n\nSi ui \u2208 A1 .\n\ni=1\n\nn\no\nb =\nu \u2208 IRd : (X1 , 0, . . . , 0) + u1I \u2208 A\n\n(\n\nu \u2208 IRd : X1 +\n\nd\nX\ni=1\n\nSi ui \u2208 A1\n\n)\n\nis the value of a set-valued risk measure RAb at (X1 , 0, . . . , 0), and RAb is KT -compatible.\nMoreover,\n)\n( d\nX\n\u03c0i ui : u \u2208 RAb ((X1 , 0, . . . , 0)) .\n\u033a (X1 ) = inf\ni=1\n\nThus, \u033a is nothing else than the scalarization of RAb (see the previous subsection) with\nv = \u03c0 \u2208 K\u0010I+ . By proposition\n5.1 \u033a is also a scalarization of the risk measure RA with\n\u0011\nb + KI 1I . This shows that the risk measures defined in [2] fit perfectly\nA = cl M A\ninto the framework of the present paper. In fact, the situation considered in [2] is a\nvery special case of our model: The idea of investing in eligible assets is covered by the\nset-valued approach presented here. We illustrate this below with a toy example taken\nfrom [2].\nMoreover, the approach of [2] can easily be generalized to situations (a) where\nproportional frictions are present together with (b) when there are future payoffs not\nonly in the \"leading\" (domestic) currency and (c) when some assets are illiquid in the\nsense that they can not be exchanged into certain others (in this case, some faces of\nthe solvency cones KI and/or KT coincide with certain faces of IRd+ , this would mean\n\u03c0i = +\u221e or Si (\u03c9) = +\u221e for some i in the framework of [2]).\nFinally, we should note that the question of a dual representation of the risk measures defined in [2] can easily be solved using the results of section 4. This problem\nwas not addressed in [2].\nThe following example is the first in the appendix of [2]. Take a probability space\nwith \u03a9 = {\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 }. Consider the case d = m = 2, the (six dimensional) payoff\n\u0001\n\b\nspace L12 \u03a9, 2\u03a9 , P and the following market model: KI = x \u2208 IR2 : x1 + x2 \u2265 0\n(one-to-one exchange between the two assets without transaction costs) and\n\b\n\b\nKT (\u03c91 ) = x \u2208 IR2 : x1 + 2x2 \u2265 0 , KT (\u03c92 ) = KI , KT (\u03c93 ) = x \u2208 IR2 : 2x1 + x2 \u2265 0 .\n21\n\n\fThe payoff is given by X = (X1 , 0) with X1 (\u03c91 ) = \u221216, X1 (\u03c92 ) = 1 and X1 (\u03c93 ) = \u22127.\nWe have\n\b\n\b\nu \u2208 IR2 : X + u1I \u2208 L12 (KT ) = u \u2208 IR2 : u1 + 2u2 \u2265 16, 2u1 + u2 \u2265 14 .\n\nThe unique minimal (in the sense of vector optimization, see [12], often called efficient)\npoint with respect to the reflexive, transitive relation generated by the cone KI (actually, a half space) is indeed the point (4, 6) computed in [2]. Obviously, transaction\ncosts can be introduced in the example in such a way that the main features remain\nunchanged (\"small\" transaction costs) or such that the whole boundary of the above\nset becomes \"efficient\".\nNote that L12 (KT ) is not a market-compatible acceptance set, but the set L12 (KT )+\nKI 1I is.

An assumption like M \u2229 IRd \\D\u03b1 (\u03c9) 6= \u2205 P -a.s. avoids this situation.\nThe definition of value at risk in the case of random terminal prices is more cumbersome than the versions in [11]. Note also that the sets D\u03b1 (\u03c9) above correspond to\nthe complement of the set D used in [11].\nA choice for the mapping D\u03b1 which seems natural would be D\u03b1 (\u03c9) = KT (\u03c9). This\nD\u03b1 satisfies (D0), (D1a), (D1b) and (D2').\n\n5.4\n\nThe worst case risk measure\n\nThe worst case risk measure should be generated by the smallest possible acceptance\nset which includes 0 \u2208 Lpd .

In this case one\ncould drop the closure in ApW C below.

This is in complete analogy to the frictionless case, compare\nfor example [8, sections 1.3, 4.8].\nIn our notation, we mainly follow [17]. We consider a financial market with d\nsecurities which can be traded over finite discrete time t = 0, . . . , T . The information\nevolves according to a filtration (Ft )Tt=0 on a probability space (\u03a9, F , P ) satisfying the\nusual conditions. In particular, it is assumed that F0 is the trivial \u03c3-algebra.\nThe market model is given by the solvency cone process (Kt (\u03c9))Tt=0 where Kt (\u03c9) is\na closed convex cone with IRd+ \u2286 Kt (\u03c9) 6= IRd for all t = 0, . . . , T and all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. The\nsolvency cone Kt is the collection of positions transferrable into nonnegative positions\nby taking into account the transaction costs at time t.\nIn contrast to the rest of the paper, where only the two time points t = 0 and t = T\nwere important, we are now also interested in trading at intermediate time points.\nThus, not only KI = K0 and KT play a role, but also the (random) solvency cones Kt\nat intermediate time points will be of interest.\nA portfolio vector is a random variable Vt : \u03a9 \u2192 IRd . The values Vt (\u03c9) of portfolio\nvectors are given in physical units, i.e., Vt,i (\u03c9) is the number of units of the ith asset\nfor i = 1, . . . , d in the portfolio at time t.\n25\n\n\fAn IRd -valued adapted process (Vt )Tt=0 is called a self-financing portfolio process for\nthe market given by (Kt )Tt=0 iff\n\u2200t = 0, . . . , T : Vt \u2212 Vt\u22121 \u2208 \u2212Kt\n\nP \u2212 a.s.\n\nwith the convention V\u22121 = 0.\nFor t = 0, . . . , T , we denote by At \u2286 L0d (\u03a9, Ft , P ) the set of random vectors Vt : \u03a9 \u2192\nIRd , each being the value of a self-financing portfolio process at time t, i.e. At is the set\nof super-hedgeable claims starting from initial endowment 0 \u2208 IRd . As it easily follows\nfrom the definition of self-financing portfolio processes, At is a convex cone.\nThe fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that the robust no arbitrage condition is satisfied for the market model (Kt )Tt=0 if and only if there exists a strictly\nconsistent pricing process (Zt )Tt=0 (see [17], theorem 1.7 for the case of a polyhedral\nmarket model and [15], theorem 18 for the general case). The definitions are as follows.\nThe market given by (Kt )Tt=0 is said to satisfy the robust no\u2013arbitrage property\n\u0010 \u0011T\net\nsatisfying\n(NAr ) iff there exists a market process K\nt=0\n\net\nKt \u2286 K\n\nfor all t = 0, . . . , T such that\n\net\nand Kt \\ \u2212 Kt \u2286 int K\n\nP \u2212 a.s.\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u0001\neT \u2229 L0 IRd = {0} ,\nA\n+\nd\n\neT is generated by the self-financing portfolio processes with\nwhere A\n\u2200t = 0, . . . , T :\n\net\nVt \u2212 Vt\u22121 \u2208 \u2212K\n\nP \u2212 a.s.\n\nAn IRd+ -valued adapted process Z = (Zt )Tt=0 is called a (strictly) consistent pricing\nprocess for the market model (Kt )Tt=0 if Z is a martingale under P and\n\u0001\n\u2200t = 0, . . . , T : Zt \u2208 Kt+ \\ {0}\n\u2208 ri Kt+ P \u2212 a.s.\n\nThe superhedging price of a claim X \u2208 L0d can be characterized as follows.\n\nTheorem 5.3 ([17], theorem 4.1, [15], corollary 15) Assume that the market process (Kt )Tt=0 satisfies the robust no-arbitrage condition (NAr ). Then, the following\nconditions are equivalent for X \u2208 L0d and u0 \u2208 IRd :\n(i) X \u2212 u0 \u2208 AT , i.e. there is a self-financing portfolio process (Vt )Tt=0 such that\nu 0 + VT = X\n26\n\nP \u2212 a.s.\n\n\f(ii) For every consistent (or, equivalently, strictly consistent) pricing process Z =\n\u0001\u2212\nis integrable it holds\n(Zt )Tt=0 such that the negative part X T ZT\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001T\nE X T ZT \u2264 u 0 Z0 .\n\nProof. This follows from theorem 18 in [15] in the same way as Theorem 4.1\nfollows from theorem 1.7 in [17] if one observes that lemma 2.5 in [17] can be replaced\nby condition (5.1).\n\u0003\nAn element u0 \u2208 IRd satisfying the conditions of theorem 5.3 is called a superhedging\nprice of X. Now, we shall show that the map assigning to X the collection of its\nsuperhedging prices defines a closed coherent risk measure on L0d .\nCorollary 5.4 An element u0 \u2208 IRd is a superhedging price for the claim X \u2208 L0d if\nand only if u0 \u2208 R\u2212AT (\u2212X) with\n\b\nR\u2212AT (\u2212X) := u \u2208 IRd : \u2212 X + u1I \u2208 \u2212AT .\n\n(5.2)\n\nIf the market process (Kt )Tt=0 satisfies the robust no-arbitrage condition (NAr ), then\nR\u2212AT is a closed coherent market-compatible risk measure on L0d and has the following\nrepresentation\n\\\n\u0001\nR\u2212AT (\u2212X) =\nE Q [X] + G (w) ,\n(5.3)\nn\no\n1\n(Q,w)\u2208W{0,...,T\n: E Q [X \u2212 ]<\u221e\n}\n\nwhere\n\b\n1\nW{0,...,T\n=\n(Q, w) \u2208 MP1,d \u00d7 IRd \\ {0} :\n}\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\ndQ\nE diag (w)\nFt \u2208 L1d \u03a9, Ft , P ; Kt+ for all t = 0, . . . , T .\ndP\n\nProof. Condition (i) of theorem 5.3 leads to the first assertion. The set \u2212AT is\nan acceptance set in the sense of definition 2.1. Indeed, the first condition is trivial,\nthe second one follows from the the robust no-arbitrage condition (NAr ) and the third\none holds since by definition, \u2212AT = K0 1I + L0d (\u03a9, F1 , P ; K1) + . . . + L0d (\u03a9, FT , P ; KT )\nand Kt (\u03c9) is a convex cone with IRd+ \u2286 Kt (\u03c9) for t = 0, . . . , T and all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. This last\ncondition also implies that \u2212AT is Kt -compatible (see definition 2.7) for all t = 0, . . . , T\nand thus market-compatible. Furthermore, \u2212AT \u2286 L0d is a convex cone and closed in L0d\n(see [17], theorem 2.1 for the polyhedral case and [15], theorem 7 for the general case),\nthus also directionally closed. Via the primal representation (2.2) with M = IRd , \u2212AT\n27\n\n\fdefines a risk measure R\u2212AT on L0d , which is closed coherent and market-compatible\naccording to proposition 2.8, 2.13 and 2.16.\nBy theorem 5.3 (ii) the set R\u2212AT (\u2212X) of superhedging prices of X can also be\nwritten in the following form\nR\u2212AT (\u2212X) =\n\n\\ \b\n\u0003\n\u0002\nu \u2208 IRd : E X T ZT \u2264 Z0T u ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nZ\u2208CP P\n\nwhere CP P is the set of consistent pricing processes Z = (Zt )Tt=0 such that the negative\n\u0001\u2212\npart X T ZT is integrable. The idea of lemma 3.5 can be applied to consistent pricing\nprocesses in order to get the representation (5.3). Indeed, starting with a consistent\n1\npricing process Z, one obtains a pair (Q, w) \u2208 W{0,...,T\n} by defining w := E [ZT ] = Z0 \u2208\n+\nK0 \\ {0} and\n1\ndQi\n:=\n(ZT )i if wi > 0,\ndP\nwi\ni\nas a density of a probability measure in L1d (IRd+ ) if\nfor i = 1, . . . , d and choosing dQ\ndP\n1\nwi = 0. Conversely, a pair (Q, w) \u2208 W{0,...,T\n} yields a consistent pricing process Z\ndQ\nby setting ZT = diag (w) dP and Zt = E [ZT |Ft ] for t = 0, . . . , T . Together with the\nrepresentation (5.4) this leads to (5.3).\n\u0003\n\nNote that for X \u2208 L0d , the set of dual elements in (5.3) depends on the particular\nargument X. This is no longer the case for X \u2208 Lpd , 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e as we will see below\nin equation (5.5).\nCorollary 5.5 Assume (NAr ). For X \u2208 Lpd , 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the superhedging prices of X\nform the value of a closed coherent market-compatible risk measure on Lpd with primal\nrepresentation\n\b\nRp (\u2212X) := u \u2208 IRd : \u2212 X + u1I \u2208 \u2212ApT ,\nwhere ApT := AT \u2229 Lpd , and dual representation\n\\\n\u0001\nE Q [X] + G (w) ,\nRp (\u2212X) =\n\n(5.5)\n\nq\n(Q,w)\u2208W{0,...,T\n}\n\nwhere\nq\nW{0,...,T\n}\n\nn\n\n= (Q, w) \u2208 MP1,d \u00d7 IRd \\ {0} :\n\u0015\n\u0014\no\ndQ\nFt \u2208 Lqd (\u03a9, Ft , P ; Kt+ ) for all t = 0, . . . , T .\nE diag (w)\ndP\n28\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fProof. This follows since \u2212ApT := \u2212AT \u2229 Lpd is a closed convex cone and a market1\ncompatible acceptance set for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e (if p = \u221e the \u03c3(L\u221e\nd , Ld ) closedness follows\nwith help of lemma A.64 in [8]). The dual representation follows from theorem 4.2 in\nconnection with corollary 5.4.\n\u0003\nIn analogy to the frictionless case, equations (5.3) and (5.5) show that the superhedging prices for a multivariate claim X form indeed the value of a set-valued coherent\nrisk measure at \u2212X.\nRemark 5.6 In contrast to theorem 4.2, a dynamic coupling condition appears in\n(5.6), which is due to the fact, that also the intermediate time points t = 0, . . . , T\nare important and enter the risk measure through its acceptance set. The dynamic\ncoupling condition in (5.6) ensures that the pricing process (Zt )Tt=0 corresponding to\n(Q, w) is consistent with the market (Kt )Tt=0 at every time point t = 0, . . . , T . Note\nthat M \u22a5 = {0}, and the dynamic coupling condition in (5.6) for t = 0 implies that\n\u0001\ndQ\n\u2208 Lqd KT+ for t = T .\nw \u2208 K0+ \\ {0} as well as diag (w) dP\n\n1\nRemark 5.7 The vector probability measures Q with (Q, w) \u2208 W{0,...,T\n} can be seen as\nequivalent martingale measures. Indeed, the component Qi , i = 1, . . . , d, is an equivalent martingale measure in the sense of [7] if asset i is chosen as num\u00e9raire. Instead\nof choosing a particular num\u00e9raire in advance, we work with all possible num\u00e9raires,\ni.e. with all Q1 , . . . , Qd representing one (scalar) equivalent martingale measure, at the\nsame time.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nAppendix\nDirectionally closed sets in Lpd\n\n\b\nM\nAs before, we use the symbol uk \u2212\u2192 0 in order to denote a sequence uk\nwith limk\u2192\u221e uk = 0.

We only give proofs for A and RA . The corresponding proofs for R and\nAR follow since R = RAR and A = ARA according to proposition 2.4.\n(a) Assume A + B \u2286 A and take X 1 , X 2 \u2208 Lpd such that X 2 \u2212 X 1 \u2208 B. Take\nu \u2208 RA (X 1 ). Then 0 \u2208 RA (X 1 + u1I) by translativity and hence X 1 + u1I \u2208 ARA = A\n(see proposition 2.4). By assumption, X 2 + u1I = X 1 + u1I + X 2 \u2212 X 1 \u2208 A, hence\nu \u2208 RA (X 2 ). This implies RA (X 1 ) \u2286 RA (X 2 ) as required.

For example, closed convex risk measure which are finite at zero are one-toone with closed convex acceptance sets satisfying (A1a) and (A1b). We also mention\nthat proposition 6.5 also includes the case m = d = 1 which produces the well-known\ncorrespondence results for extended real-valued risk measures and their acceptance sets\nin Lp1 - even for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.\n\n6.3\n\nConvex set-valued functions and proof of the main theorem\n\nFact 1. R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is convex if and only if graph R is convex. The proof is\nstraightforward.\nFact 2. A M-translative function R is convex if and only if AR is convex if and only\nif all sets of the form\n{X \u2208 Lpd : u \u2208 R (X)} , u \u2208 M,\nare convex. Proposition 6.4 produces this fact.\nFact 3. If R is closed convex and R (X 0 ) 6= M for X 0 \u2208 Lpd with R (X 0 ) 6= \u2205, then\nR (X) 6= \u2205 for all X \u2208 Lpd . See [9], proposition 5.\nFor the proof of theorem 4.2, we shall make use of the Fenchel conjugation concept\nfor set-valued functions introduced in [9], [10]. Let R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) be a function.

The following remark justifies the definition of the\nbiconjugate giving afterwards.\nRemark 6.6 If R : Lpd \u2192 P (M) is a closed convex and KI -compatible risk measure,\n\b\n\u0001\nthen R (X) \u2208 GM = D \u2286 IRd : D = cl co D + KIM\nfor all X \u2208 Lpd . In this case,\n\u0001+\nthe additional dual variable v can be restricted to KIM\n(compare proposition 3.3,\n(f )).\nThe biconjugate of a function R : Lpd \u2192 GM is defined by\n\\\n\u0001\nM\nR\u2217\u2217 (X) =\n\u2212R\u2217 (Y, v) + F(Y,v)\n[X] ,\n\nX \u2208 Lpd .\n\n+\n\nY \u2208Lqd , v\u2208(KIM ) \\{0}\n\nM\n's act as substitutes for real-valued continuous\nNote that in these definitions the F(Y,v)\nlinear functions.

Compare theorem 2 in [9].\nIt turns out that Fenchel conjugates for set-valued risk measures can be computed\nin terms of set-valued support functions of their acceptance sets.\n\nProposition 6.7 Let R : Lpd \u2192 GM be a market-compatible convex risk measure which\n\u0001+\nis finite at zero and has the acceptance set AR .
