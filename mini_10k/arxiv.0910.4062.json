Introduction\nOne of the major motivations of the LHC experiments is to search for physics beyond the Standard\nModel (SM). Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a favored candidate in this search. However, SUSY must be broken so that the masses of super particles exceed those\nof their SM partners. The minimal supersymmetric\nextension of the standard model (MSSM) does not\nincorporate SUSY breaking and has 124 free parameters. SUSY breaking can be achieved by introducing a hidden sector. The mediation of the breaking from the hidden sector to the observable MSSM\nsector is enabled by different mechanisms such as\nmSUGRA, gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB)\nand AMSB through gravity, gauge or anomalous interactions. Through this mediation, the number of\nfree parameters is significantly reduced.\nWe have investigated neutralino pair production\nat\n\u221a\nthe LHC at a center of mass energy of s = 10 TeV\nwithin the framework of a GMSB scenario [1]. A distinctive phenomenological feature of the GMSB model\nis the presence of neutral dibosons (Z or \u03b3) plus missing transverse energy (6ET ) in the final state.\nThis note\u221areports on the sensitivity of the ATLAS\ndetector at s = 10 TeV for the process pp \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192\nZ(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 G\u0303G\u0303, where l = \u03bc/e. \u03c7\u030301 in this process\nis a Higgsino-like neutralino, which is the next-tolightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) in the model\nconsidered here [2]. It decays to a neutral vector boson\n(Z or \u03b3) and a gravitino (G\u0303), the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which escapes detection resulting in large E\n6 T.\n\n1.1. Theoretical overview\nIn GMSB models, SUSY, which is broken at a\nTeV scale in a hidden sector, is propagated down\nto the MSSM observable sector via new chiral supermultiplets, called messengers, that couple indirectly to the MSSM particles through the ordinary\n\nSU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge boson and gaugino interactions. The main advantage of GMSB models is the automatic creation of identical soft SUSY\nbreaking masses for scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers but different flavors. Therefore, there\nare no problems with flavor changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) or CP violation constraints.\nWithin the minimal version of the GMSB framework (mGMSB), the couplings, branching ratios, decay widths and sparticles masses are determined by\nthe parameters:\n\u039b, M, N5 , tan(\u03b2), sign(\u03bc), Cgrav .\n\n(1)\n\n\u039b is the SUSY breaking energy scale, \u039b = F/M ,\nwhere F is a vacuum expectation value of an auxiliary\nfield that determines the magnitude of supersymmetry breaking in the vacuum state. M is the size of the\nmessenger mass scale, M > \u039b. \u221a\nFor electroweak scale\nsuperpartners, \u039b is \u223c 100 TeV/ N 5 . N5 is the number of generations of messenger fields, tan(\u03b2) is the\nratio of the MSSM Higgs vacuum expectation values\n(hHu0 i/hHd0 i), sign(\u03bc) is the sign of the Higgs sector\nmixing parameter and Cgrav is the ratio of the messenger sector SUSY breaking order parameter to the\nintrinsic SUSY breaking order parameter, which controls the coupling to the gravitino.\nIn GMSB, G\u0303 is the LSP (usually, M(G\u0303) << 1 GeV).\nThe G\u0303 has a derivative coupling to each particle and\nits superpartner with an interaction\nstrength that is\n\u221a\ninversely proportional to F . Because of this coupling, the next-to-lightest superpartner is unstable\nand decays to its lighter partner through G\u0303 emission.\nAs a result, the nature of the NLSP defines the phenomenology of the GMSB model. Depending on the\nregion in parameter space, either the neutralino(\u03c7\u030301 )\nor the \u03c4\u0303 arise as the\u221aNLSP. The NLSP decay length,\nwhich depends on F , can be divided into three\nranges: (1) the NLSP decays promptly, (2) the NLSP\ndecays \u221a\ninside the detector away from the collision\n6\npoint ( F <\nthe NLSP decays\n\u223c 10 GeV),\n\u221a and (3)\n6\noutside the detector ( F > 10 GeV). We consider\nonly the case where the NLSP is the \u03c7\u030301 , which decays\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2009 Conference, Detroit, MI, July 27-31, 2009\n\npromptly, corresponding to Cgrav = 1.\n\u03c7\u030301 is a mixture of gaugino (B\u0303, W \u0303 0 ) and Higgsino\n \u0303\n(Hu0 , H \u0303d0 ) eigenstates, and therefore \u03c7\u030301 decays to a\n\u03b3, Z, or Higgs (h). If \u03c7\u030301 is gaugino-like, it decays\nmostly to \u03b3 G\u0303, leading to the \u03b3\u03b3 + E\n6 T signature (with\nR-parity conservation, supersymmetric particles are\nproduced in pairs). If the \u03c7\u030301 is Higgsino-like, it decays to hG\u0303. In addition, since the longitudinal component of the Z boson mixes with the Goldstone mode\nof the Higgs field, a Higgsino-like neutralino also decays to Z G\u0303. Because of a strong phase space suppression of the h and Z final states, decay to a \u03b3 can\nalso be important for Higgsino-like neutralinos, which\nare not very much heavier than the Z boson. Consequently, a pair of Higgsino-like neutralinos produced\nin a collider can give rise to the diboson final states\n(\u03b3\u03b3, hh, h\u03b3, hZ, Z\u03b3, ZZ) + E\n6 T [3], [4]. We consider\nthe possibility of a Higgsino-like \u03c7\u030301 NLSP, where one\nneutralino decays to \u03b3 G\u0303 and the other decays to Z G\u0303,\nleading to the Z\u03b3 + E\n6 T signature.\n\n1.2. Z\u03b3 + E\n6 T signature\nTo study the Z\u03b3 + E\n6 T signature in the GMSB\nframework, we generated a sample of pp \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192\nZ(l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 G\u0303G\u0303 events, where l = \u03bc/e, using a\n(non-minimal GMSB) Higgsino-like neutralino model\n(model line E), described in [2]. This model is characterized by the following parameters:\nM/\u039b = 3, N5 = 2, tan(\u03b2) = 3, \u03bc = 0.75M1,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M1 is the gaugino mass and yields 225.4 GeV.\nUnlike in the mGMSB, where the absolute value of \u03bc\nis set by the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)\nradiative conditions as shown in equation [3], \u03bc is set\nto 0.75M1 in this approach, which gives rise to a large\nHiggsino fraction in the neutralino.\n\u03bc2 = \u2212\n\nm2 \u2212 m2 tan2 (\u03b2)\nm2Z\n+ Hu 2 Hd\n2\ntan (\u03b2) \u2212 1\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 1, taken from [2], shows the production\ncross-sections for sparticles(left plot) and branching\nfractions of \u03c7\u030301 (right plot) in model line E, as a function of the most influential parameter, \u039b. The dominant source of sparticles in this model is production of neutralino pairs, chargino pairs (\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\ni , i = 1,2),\nand chargino-neutralino pairs. Charginos and heavier neutralinos decay to \u03c7\u030301 through cascade decays.\nGluinos and squarks are relatively heavy; therefore,\ntheir production becomes suppressed when \u039b is increased [2]. The branching ratio Br(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z G\u0303) becomes dominant for \u039b > 80 TeV (M(\u03c7\u030301 )\u223c134 GeV);\nwe thus choose this value of \u039b for the current study.\nThis choice gives a production cross-section of the decay \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z(l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 G\u0303G\u0303, where l = \u03bc/e, of about\n\n56.2 fb. The cross-section is calculated as follows:\n2 \u00d7 \u03c3(pp \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 ) \u00d7 Br(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z G\u0303) \u00d7 Br(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03b3 G\u0303)\n\u00d7 Br(Z \u2192 l+ l\u2212 ), where \u03c3(pp \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 ) = 1880 fb,\nBr(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03b3 G\u0303) = 0.55, Br(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z G\u0303) = 0.4, and\nBr(Z \u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) = 0.067 [5].

Background\nThe major background processes are summarized\nin Table II. We consider three types of background:\n(1) real Z\u03b3 pairs from SM Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) + X processes\nwhich include initial state radiation (ISR) of photons\nfrom the colliding quarks and final state photon radiation (FSR) from the Z decay leptons; (2) events with\none real Z and jets which are misidentified as \u03b3's; and\n(3) top pairs which decay to leptons: tt\u0304 \u2192 l + X.\n\n4. Event selection\nTo identify muons, electrons, and photons we used\nthe following criteria:\n\n\u0088 Muons are identified with an algorithm which\nassociates a track found in the muon spectrometer, after corrections for energy loss in the\ncalorimeter, with the corresponding inner detector track. This association is performed by statistically combining the two fitted sets of track\nparameters using their corresponding error matrices. The rapidity acceptance of the combined\nmuon track is limited by the inner detector to\n|\u03b7| < 2.5.\n\u0088 Electrons are identified using a multivariate\nBoosted Decision Trees (BDT) classification algorithm. BDT input variables are selected from\nmeasurements in the hadron calorimeter, the\n\n\f4\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2009 Conference, Detroit, MI, July 27-31, 2009\n\nelectromagnetic calorimeter and the inner detector. In the hadron calorimeter the principal\nvariable is the fraction of hadronic ET leakage\nof the total cluster ET . The first two longitudinal samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter\nprovide sets of correlated variables, including,\nfor example, the fraction of energy deposited in\neach sampling. Track parameters and the number of hits in each of the inner detector layers\nprovide a third set of variables; and finally, a set\nof inner detector track and EM cluster matching\nparameters are used. There are approximately\n20 input variables incorporated by the BDT algorithm.\n\u0088 Photons are selected using the 'tight' category\nof photon identification cuts described in [10].\n\nTo select events with Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) and \u03b3, the following preselection cuts are applied. To select a\ngood lepton candidate, the pT (l) is required to be\ngreater than 6 GeV with |\u03b7| < 2.5. A cut of 30\nGeV is applied on the leading lepton. In the preselected lepton sample, we search for di-lepton candidates with 70 GeV < M (l+ l\u2212 ) < 100 GeV. To select \u03b3 candidates, the pT (\u03b3) is required to be greater\nthan 20 GeV. To reject \u03b3 produced through lepton\nbremsstrahlung\np radiation, the minimal value of \u2206R,\nwhere \u2206R = \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c62 , between selected leptons\nand \u03b3 is required to be greater than 0.1. Table III\nshows the efficiencies and effective remaining crosssections after preselection cuts are applied to the signal and background processes. Figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution of l+ l\u2212 after preselection.\n\n4.1. Z\u03b3 + E\n6 T selection\nAfter preselection, significant background contamination remains from SM Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 and inclusive\nZ(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) + X processes, which have large production cross-sections. The former has a topology similar to the signal, where a real Z and \u03b3 tend to be\nback-to-back in the transverse plane. However, the\nreconstruction efficiency of this sample is one order of\nmagnitude lower than the signal efficiency due to the\npT (\u03b3) cut, applied in the preselection. For the latter, the source of the \u03b3's is mostly misidentified jets;\ntherefore, the reconstruction efficiency is low. For further rejection of background, various distributions of\nkinematic variables of the background and signal MC\nsamples were compared.\nThe lepton pair is required to have an invariant mass close to the Z mass, specifically |Mll \u2212\n91.2 GeV| < 13 GeV. This requirement is equivalent\nto a 5\u03c3 width, and helps to reduce background where\nthe lepton pair does not come directly from a Z.\nThe minimal value of \u2206R between leptons and \u03b3\nis required to be greater than 0.4. This cut rejects\n\nTable III Results after preselection for the signal and\nbackground MC samples.

The\npT of the \u03b3 is required to be greater than 30 GeV.\nThe pT of muons and electrons from the decay \u03c7\u030301 \u2192\nZ(l+ l\u2212 )G\u0303 is high relative to the low pT leptons which\ndecay from b hadrons. Therefore the cut of 10 GeV\napplied to the minimum pT leptons helps to reject the\ntt\u0304 background events.\n\nIn addition, tt\u0304 and Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) + X events can be\neffectively reduced by track isolation conditions on the\nleptons and photons. The isolation condition consists\nof requiring less than four tracks in a cone of \u2206R =\n0.3 around the reconstructed lepton and \u03b3. A cut of\n\u2206d0 < 0.1 mm (\u2206d0 < 0.15 mm) for muons (electrons) and \u2206z0 < 1 mm, where \u2206d0 (\u2206z0 ) is the difference between the transverse(longitudinal) impact\nparameters of the tracks, helps to reject tracks from b\nhadron decays which are expected to have, on average,\nlarge transverse and longitudinal impact parameters.\n\n5. Results\nTable IV summarizes the results of the analysis\nfor an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 . Since the\nZ(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) + X sample includes ISR photons, the\nZ(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 sample was not included in the total\nbackground estimation to avoid the double counting\nof Z\u03b3 events. After selection, four events remain in the\nZ(\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )+X sample; two of these events (0.5\u00b10.4\nevents for 1 fb\u22121 ) include ISR photons. This number\nis consistent with the Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 sample, which has\none event (0.3\u00b10.3 events for 1 fb\u22121 ) that survives the\nselection criteria. The two remaining events surviving\nselection cuts from the Z(\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) + X sample include fake photons. The number of expected events\nfrom the Z(\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )+ X sample due to jets misidentified as photons is thus expected to be 0.5 \u00b1 0.4.

For\nan integrated luminosity of 3 fb\u22121 the significance is\nexpected to be 4.2\u03c3 for muons, 3.6\u03c3 for electrons, and\n5.6\u03c3 for the combined samples assuming 20% systematic uncertainty.\n\n6. Summary\nThis note presents a study of a GMSB search at\nATLAS with a Z\u03b3 + E\n6 T final state where the Z is\nreconstructed using ee or \u03bc\u03bc based on fully simulated\nMC events. The study has been performed within\nthe GMSB model line E with \u039b=80 TeV, using 50k\nfully simulated signal events of \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z(l+ l\u2212 )\u03b3 G\u0303G\u0303\nthat are characterized by two high pT leptons plus\nan energetic \u03b3 with 6 ET . The results show that a\nsignificance of 5.6\u03c3, assuming 20% systematic uncertainty, can be attained with an integrated luminosity\nof 3 fb\u22121 in the combination of the Z(e+ e\u2212 )\u03b3 and\nZ(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\u03b3 final states using a cut-based method after taking into account the background contributions\nfrom SM tt\u0304, Z(\u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) + X , and W Z. This suggests\nthe feasibility of a search for GMSB at ATLAS with\n3 fb\u22121 of\n\u221a integrated luminosity given a center of mass\nenergy s = 10 TeV.\n\nReferences\nTable V This table includes the number of expected signal/background events for 1 fb\u22121 , p-value, and the significance assuming 20% systematic uncertainty, where p-value\nis the probability of the background to fluctuate to the total observation.\nZ(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\u03b3 + E\n6 T Z(e+ e\u2212 )\u03b3 + E\n6 T combined\nNs\n5.4 \u00b1 0.06\n3.4 \u00b1 0.05\n8.8 \u00b1 0.1\nNb\n2.05 \u00b1 0.6\n1.0 \u00b1 0.35\n3.1 \u00b1 0.7\np-value\n0.004\n0.04\n0.0007\nSignificance\n2.7\u03c3\n1.8\u03c3\n3.2\u03c3\n\nFor an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 , 5.4 \u00b1 0.06\nand 3.4 \u00b1 0.05 signal events (Ns ) with 2.05 \u00b1 0.6 and\n1.0 \u00b1 0.35 background events (Nb ) are expected for\nthe muon and electron samples, respectively.
