The\ncritical number of stars at which gravothermal oscillations first appeared is found\nusing a gas code. The nature of the oscillations is investigated and it is shown that the\noscillations can be understood by focusing on the behaviour of the heavier component,\nbecause of mass segregation. It is argued that, during each oscillation, the re-collapse\nof the cluster begins at larger radii while the core is still expanding. This re-collapse\ncan halt and reverse a gravothermally driven expansion. This material outside the\ncore contracts because it is losing energy both to the cool expanding core and to the\nmaterial at larger radii. The core collapse times for each model are also found and\ndiscussed.

The inner regions of a post collapse cluster\nare approximately isothermal and are subject to a similar instability as the one found in an isothermal sphere in a spherical container, as studied by Antonov (1962) and LyndenBell & Wood (1968). Gravothermal oscillations, which are\nthought to be a manifestation of this instability, were discovered by Bettwieser & Sugimoto (1984) whilst studying the\npost-collapse evolution of star clusters using a gas model.\nFor a gas model of a one-component cluster it was found\nthat gravothermal oscillations first appear when the number of stars N is greater than 7000 (Goodman 1987). This\nvalue of N has also been found with Fokker-Planck calculations (Cohn et al 1989) and by direct N -body simulations\n(Makino 1996). However, in a multi-component cluster the\nsituation is more complicated. The presence of different mass\ncomponents introduces different dynamical processes to the\nsystem such as mass stratification. Multi-component systems try to achieve kinetic energy equipartition between the\n\n?\n\nE-mail: p.g.breen@sms.ed.ac.uk\n\u2020 E-mail: d.c.heggie@ed.ac.uk\n\ncomponents, which causes the heavier stars to move more\nslowly and sink towards the centre. This can lead to the\nSpitzer instability (Spitzer 1987) in which the heavier stars\ncontinuously lose energy to the lighter stars without ever being able to reach equipartition. Murphy et al (1990) found\nthat the post-collapse evolution for multi-component models was stable to much higher values of N than in the case\nof the one-component system and that the value of N at\nwhich gravothermal oscillations appeared varied with different mass functions.\nIn order to gain a deeper understanding of gravothermal\noscillations, it is desirable to work with simpler models in\nwhich some of the effects which are present in real star clusters are ignored or simplified. For example, real star clusters\nhave a range of stellar masses present, but in the current paper, the stellar masses are limited to two. Gaseous models\nare often used in this kind of research (Bettwieser & Sugimoto 1984; Goodman 1987; Heggie & Aarseth 1992) because\nthey are computationally efficient. Kim, Lee & Goodman\n(1998) have already completed research in this area using\nFokker-Planck models. However, their research was limited\nto mostly Spitzer stable models and only a small range of\nstellar mass ratios. The study in the present paper looks\nat the more general Spitzer unstable models using various\nstellar mass and total mass ratios.\n\n\f2\n\nP. G. Breen and D. C. Heggie\n\nThere is also evidence of gravothermal oscillations in\nreal star clusters. Giersz & Heggie (2009) modelled the cluster NGC 6397 using Monte Carlo models and found fluctuation in the core radius. Their timescale suggests that they\nare gravothermal. Subsequently, they confirmed these fluctuations using direct N -body methods with initial conditions\ngenerated from the Monte Carlo model (Heggie & Giersz\n2009).\nTwo-component clusters may seem very unrealistic but\nthere is reason to believe that they may be a good approximation to multi-component systems. Kim & Lee (1997) were\nable to find good approximate matches for half-mass radius\nrh , central velocity dispersion vc , core density \u03c1c and core\ncollapse time tcc between two-component models and elevencomponent models which were designed to approximate a\npower law IMF. Also see Kim, Lee & Goodman (1998) for\na discussion of the realism of two-component models.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the models which are used. This is followed by Section\n3, in which the results concerning gravothermal oscillations\nare given. Section 4 is concerned with the results of the core\ncollapse times. In Section 5, the results of N -body simulations are given. Finally Section 6 consists of the conclusions\nand a discussion.\n\n2\n\nMODELS\n\n2.1\n\nGas model\n\n2.1.1\n\nBasic equations and Notation\n\nIn our model, we ignore primordial binaries and stellar evolution, and assume that the energy generating mechanism\nis the formation of binary stars in three body encounters\nand subsequent encounters of binaries with single stars. In\na one-component model the rate of energy generation per\nunit mass is approximately\n\u000f = 85\n\nG5 m5 n2\n\u03c3c7\n\n(1)\n\n(Heggie & Hut 2003), where m is the stellar mass, n is the\nnumber density, \u03c3c is the one dimensional velocity dispersion\nof the core and G is the gravitational constant. Goodman\n(1987), whose results on the 1-component model we shall\noccasionally refer to, used a similar formula, with a coefficient which is, in effect, in the range 140\u2013170 (depending on\nthe value of N ).\nThe equations of the two-component gas model (Heggie\n& Aarseth 1992) are given below:\n\u2202Mi\n= 4\u03c0\u03c1i r2\n\u2202r\n\n(2)\n\nG(M1 + M2 )\n\u2202pi\n=\u2212\n\u03c1i\n\u2202r\nr2\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202\u03c3i\n\u03c3i Li\n=\u2212\n\u2202r\n12\u03c0Cmi \u03c1i r2 ln \u039b\n\n(4)\n\n\u2202Li\n=\n\u2202r\n\nh \u0010 D \u0011 \u0010 \u03c33 \u0011\ni\n\u22124\u03c0r2 \u03c1i \u03c3i2\nln\n+ \u03b4i,2 \u000f\n(5)\nDt\n\u03c1i\nh\ni\ni\n1\n\u03c13\u2212i\n2\n2\n+4(2\u03c0) 2 G2 ln \u039b\n3 (m3\u2212i \u03c33\u2212i \u2212 mi \u03c3i )\n(\u03c312 + \u03c322 ) 2\n\nTable 1.

This model in turn is ultimately inspired\nby the one-component model of Lynden-Bell & Eggleton\n(1980).\nThe meaning of the symbols can be found in Table 1.\nThe major difference between the above equations and those\nfor the one-component model is the last term of equation 5,\nwhich involves the exchange of kinetic energy between the\ntwo components. See Spitzer (1987, p.39) for information on\nthis term. As the heavier component dominates in the core\nof the cluster, it is assumed that all of the energy is that\ngenerated from the second component. Hence the Kronecker\ndelta \u03b42,i in the last equation. There are two constants in\nthe gas code which can be adjusted: C and the coefficient\n\u03bb of N in \u039b = \u03bbN . The value of \u03bb = 0.02 was used as it\nwas found to provide a good fit for multi-component models\n(Giersz & Heggie 1996). The value of C used was 0.104\n(Heggie & Ramamani 1989). This value of C results from\nthe comparison of core collapse between gas and FokkerPlanck models of single component systems and it is not\nclear if it applies accurately to post-collapse two-component\nmodels.\n\n2.1.2\n\nThe role of N in the gas code\n\nThis paper places emphasis on the role of N in evolution,\nbut it is not clear what role N plays in equations (2) \u2013 (5).\nFor fixed structure (i.e. \u03c1i (r), etc), N appears explicitly in\n\u039b (where its role is rather insignificant), and in the individual masses mi . These appear in equations (4) and (5). In a\nsystem with fixed structure, equation (4) shows\nLi \u221d m ln \u039b \u221d\n\nln \u03bbN\n,\nN\n\nreflecting the fact that the flux L is caused by two-body\nrelaxation, and its time scale is proportional to lnN\u03bbN . In\nequation (5) N plays a similar role in the last term on the\nright, which governs the approach to equipartition. It also\nappears implicitly through \u000f, because of the m dependence\nin equation (1). For a system of given structure, its contribution to L in equation (5) is proportional to N \u22123 (as we\nare assuming that \u03c1 = mn is fixed and so \u000f in equation (1)\nis proportional to m3 ). It would seem as though this term\nis insignificant for large N . In practice, however, the system compensates by increasing the central density so that \u000f\n\n\fGravothermal oscillations\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

NBODY6 has a range of features and options such as individual time steps which make\nit an excellent direct N -body code. NBODY6 is written\nin FORTRAN and is publicly available for download from\nwww.ast.cam.ac.uk/\u223c sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm .\n\n3\n\nCRITICAL VALUE OF N\n\nIf the value of N is not too large, then, after core collapse,\nthe cluster expands at a steady rate (Fig. 1, top). However,\nat a larger value of N the central density (\u03c1c ) was found\nto oscillate (Fig. 1, bottom). Goodman (1987) showed that\nfor one-component models the steady expansion is unstable\nfor large values of N and found that the value at which\noscillations first appeared is N = 7000. In this present paper,\nthe case of two-component models is investigated.\n\n3.1\n\nResults of the gas code\n\nIn all cases, the initial conditions used were Plummer models (Plummer 1911; Heggie & Hut 2003). The initial velocity dispersions of both components were equal and the\ninitial ratio of density of each component was equal at all\nlocations. The initial conditions were constructed with dif2\n= 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50 and for\nferent stellar mass ratios m\nm1\neach of these mass ratios, a model with total mass ratios\nM2\n= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1 was constructed. A python\nM1\nscript was used to run the gas model code over a range of\nvalues of N for each of the pairs of mass ratios. Each run\nterminated when the time value reached 30 initial relaxation\ntimes (ti,rh ).The value of the central density was checked for\nan increase in value of 5 percent or more in any interval over\nthe time period between 20ti,rh and 30ti,rh . If an increase\nwas found, the run was deemed to be unstable and the range\nof N was refined. This process continued until the critical\nvalue of N (Ncrit ) at which oscillations first appeared was\ndetermined (correct to ten percent). The values of Ncrit were\nalso visually confirmed from the output of the gas code. The\nobtained values of Ncrit in units of 104 are given in Table 2.\nFig. 2 shows a contour plot of log10 Ncrit .\n3.2\n\nInterpretation of the results\n\nIn order to attempt to interpret the results in the previous\nsubsection, it is helpful to illustrate the mass density distribution of each component within the cluster and this is\ndone in Fig. 3.\n\n\f4\n\nP.

Right: System with M\nm\n1\n\n1\n\nm2\nFirstly, let us consider models in which m\n\u001d 1. In a\n1\nregion where both components are present at comparable\ndensities, there is a strong tendency towards mass segregation. Therefore, in the region at which \u03c1\u03c112 \u223c 1, the ratio \u03c1\u03c121\nis a rapidly decreasing function of the radius, i.e .the transition region is narrow. Inside this region, m2 dominates, and\nm1 dominates outside. Clearly the radius at which this re2\ngion is located increases with M\n, and must be near rh when\nM1\nM2\n2\n=\n1\n(Fig.\n4).\nFinally,\nfor\nmodels\nin which m\n6\u001d 1, the\nM1\nm1\ntendency towards mass segregation decreases, the decrease\nof \u03c1\u03c112 with r is more gradual, and the transition region is\nmore extensive (Fig. 5). For the same reason the regions\ndominated by a single component are more restricted than\nm2\n\u001d 1.\nwhen m\n1\n\n3.2.1\n\nDependence on the number of heavy stars N2\n\nThe values of N2 at Ncrit are given in Table 3. The variation in N2 is considerably less than that of Ncrit . For large\nm2\nM2\nand fixed M\n, the value of N2 has approximately the\nm1\n1\n2\n. Now, we give a possible insame value, independent of m\nm1\nterpretation of this empirical finding that the stability of the\nsystem is dominated by the heavy component.\n2\n2\nFirstly, let us consider the case of M\n& 1 and m\n\u001d1\nM1\nm1\n\n(Fig. 4, left). Within rh the heavy component dominates and\nmost of the light component is removed to the outer halo.\nIn this case, the light component acts as a container for the\nheavy component. Here, the stellar mass of the light component is not the most important factor, rather the most\nimportant factor is the overall mass of the container. If we\nwere to replace this by an equal mass of stars with stellar\nmass m2 , the behaviour of the stars inside rh would be nearly\nthe same, and so the value of N2 at the stability boundary\nwould be roughly the same as for a one-component model.\nIndeed, since part of the container consists of stars of mass\nm1 , this could also explain why the values of N2 are in fact\nsomewhat less than the value of Ncrit for a one-component\nsystem (i.e. 7000, Goodman (1987)) and, in fact, why the\nM2\n. On\ncritical value of N2 is decreasing with decreasing M\n1\nthe other hand, the fact that the critical value of N2 is less\nthan 7000 may also partly be due to the fact that the energy\ngeneration rate, equation (1), is smaller than that used by\nGoodman. In his paper (Goodman 1987, equation II.26) he\nshows implicitly that the critical value of N is approximately\nproportional to the square root of the numerical coefficient\nin \u000f. At any rate, the arguments we have presented are consistent with the results in the uppermost rows of Table 3.\n2\n. 1 (Fig. 4, right). If\nSecondly, consider the case M\nM1\nthe system is Spitzer unstable, the heavy component decouples from the light component and forms its own subsystem. This heavy subsystem can itself become gravothermally unstable and exhibit a temperature inversion in the\nsame way as a one-component model. In this case, however,\nthere is not enough mass in the heavy component to dominate throughout the region within rh , and so it is not quite\nas easy to relate this to the one-component case. Rather, we\nassume that the heavy component behaves like a detached\none-component model. However, the basic conclusion is still\n\n\fGravothermal oscillations\nthe same, the stability of the model is determined by the\nheavy component. Since the heavy component is again sitting in the potential well of the lighter stars, it is easier for\na nearly isothermal region to be set up in the heavier stars\nthan if the entire system consisted of heavy stars, and we\nagain expect Ncrit to correspond to a lower value of N2 than\nin the one-component case.\nThere is also a noticeable increase in the values of N2\n2\nwith decreasing m\nin the top rows of Table 3. There is\nm1\ncurrently no clear interpretation of this effect but it may\npossibly be related to the effect of mass segregation, as the\nregion dominated by the heavy component is larger for larger\nm2\n(see Fig. 5).\nm1\n3.2.2\n\nTable 4.

Here Etot is the total energy, Ec is the energy of the\ncore, trc is the core relaxation time and trh is the half mass\nrelaxation time. Kim, Lee & Goodman (1998) carried out\nresearch using a Fokker-Planck model which seemed to support the condition, although the models they studied were\nall Spitzer stable.\nWe have compared the values of \u000f found by Kim, Lee\n& Goodman (1998) to results obtained from the gas code\n(Table 4). All the models compared in Table 4, which are\nthe same as those studied by Kim, Lee & Goodman (1998),\nare stable in the post-collapse expansion as well as being\nSpitzer stable. An important difference between the FokkerPlanck model used by Kim, Lee & Goodman (1998) and the\ngas code used in this paper is that Kim, Lee & Goodman\n(1998) included an energy generation term in both components, whereas the gas code only contains an energy generation term in the heavier component. Therefore, it would be\nexpected, in the case of the gas code, that the core would\nhave to collapse further in order to generate the required\namount of energy (from H\u00e9non's principle, see Section 3.3).\nThis could explain the differences in the values of rrhc in TaM2\nble 4. However, as M\nincreases, the heavier component will\n1\ndominate in the core and the energy generation of the lighter\ncomponent will then become negligible. As can be seen in\nTable 4, there is good agreement between the two results\nM2\nfor log10 \u000f even though there are only small values of M\n.\n1\nAlso, it is possible that Kim, Lee & Goodman (1998) used\na different definition of trc than the one used in this paper\n(see equation 7). However, as there is such good agreement\nbetween the values in Table 4, it is unlikely that Kim, Lee\n& Goodman (1998) used a significantly different definition.\nUnlike the other models in the present paper, the models in\nTable 4 are Spitzer stable. These runs have only been carried out in order to make a comparison of the calculation of\n\u000f and rrhc using the gas code with the results of Kim, Lee &\nGoodman (1998). Next we will test the use of epsilon as a\nstability criterion for Spitzer unstable cases.\nWe tested the stability criterion based on equation (6)\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.2\n\n-1.65\n-1.68\n-1.65\n2\n\n-1.78\n-1.90\n-1.84\n5\n\n-2.15\n-2.15\n-1.95\n10\n\n-2.75\n-2.75\n-2.48\n50\n\nm2\nm1\n\n2\nfor the subset of models given in Table 5. For each fixed M\nM1\nm2\nand m1 , the values of \u000f were found to decrease with increased\nN up until the post-collapse evolution became unstable. The\nvalues of log10 \u000f given in Table 5 are the values for the run\nwith the highest stable N . As can be seen from Table 5 the\nvalue of log10 \u000f is indeed in the region of \u22122. However, the\n2\nlimiting value of stable \u000f varies with m\nand to a much lesser\nm1\nM2\nextent with M1 .\nNow we shall try to improve upon the definition of \u000f.

We suggest that a modified version of the\nGoodman stability parameter could be constructed using\na relaxation time based on the heavy component in place\n2\nof trh . For example, if M\n& 1 and we assume that the\nM2\nheavier component dominates within rh , then the properties of the system within rh would be roughly similar to\nthat of a one-component system with the same total mass.\nWe can attempt to treat the system as if it consisted entirely of the heavy component with an effective number of\nM\nstars Nef = m\n.

For the cases with M\n1\nhow to define an appropriate relaxation time, and so we will\nnot consider the modified stability condition for those cases.\nTo summarise, the values of \u000f (and especially \u000f2 ) seem\nto give an indication of stability for the two-component models but the values of \u000f were found to change with different\nm2\n). The critical value of \u000f2 is much less\nconditions (e.g m\n1\nvariable. The critical value of log10 \u000f or log10 \u000f2 is still to be\ntested for multi-component models, and this would be an\ninteresting topic for further research.\n3.3\n\nWeak oscillations\n\nH\u00e9non (1975) suggested that the energy generation rate of\nthe core is determined by the requirement that it meets the\nenergy demands of the rest of the cluster. This demand is\nnormally thought of in terms of the energy flux at the half\nmass radius. We shall refer to this as H\u00e9non's principle. This\nprinciple, together with the notion of gravothermal instability, is the basis of the usual qualitative picture of gravothermal oscillations (Bettwieser & Sugimoto 1984), which we\nnow recap.\nIn a situation with very large N , the core has to collapse to a small size in order to meet the required energy\ngeneration. The steady state is gravothermally unstable, as\nthere would be a large density contrast in a nearly isothermal region. If the core is generating more energy than can\nbe conducted away, this would cause the core to expand,\ncool and reduce its rate of energy generation. If there is sufficient expansion, then the core would be cooler than its surroundings. This would result in the core starting to absorb\nheat. Since the core has a negative specific heat capacity,\nthis would cause the core to expand further and became\neven cooler than before (Bettwieser & Sugimoto 1984). Ultimately, however, the core must collapse again to meet the\nenergy requirements of the rest of the cluster. Here, we adapt\nthis explanation of gravothermal oscillations to the case of\ntwo-component clusters.\n\nIn one-component gas models, as N increases the instability first appears in the form of periodic oscillations1 (Heggie & Ramamani 1989). In order to study the instability for\nthe case of weak or low amplitude oscillations in our twocomponent model, a model was chosen which demonstrated\n2\n2\nperiodic oscillation with parameters m\n= 2, M\n= 1 and\nm1\nM1\nm2\nM2\n4\nN = 2.0 \u00d7 10 (the value of Ncrit for m1 = 2, M\n= 1 is\n1\n1.7 \u00d7 103 from Table 2). Fig. 6 plots ln \u03c1 at various fixed values of log r for this model. The total energy flux L is shown\nin Fig. 7 over the particular expansion phase from 24.54ti,rh\nto 25.18ti,rh and the contraction phase from 25.18ti,rh to\n26.52ti,rh . Fig. 8 shows the profiles of log \u03c1 and log \u03c3 2 over\nthe expansion phase from 24.54ti,rh to 25.18ti,rh .\nDuring the expansion of the core, the flux in the inner\nregion (between rc and rh ) drops and eventually becomes\nnegative (Fig. 7, top) in a small range of the radius. At this\npoint there is an inwards flux of energy to the core. Since the\ncore has a negative heat capacity, it would be expected that\nthis would enhance the negative flux and therefore the expansion. However, the expansion stops at this point. This is\nsimilar to behaviour observed by McMillan & Engle (1996).\nNow we explain why this happens. H\u00e9non (1975) argues that\nthe flux at rh must be maintained, and we note that there is\nalways a positive flux at the half-mass radius rh . Since the\nflux from the core becomes negative at some radius between\nrc and rh , there must be a positive flux gradient in some\nregion between the core and half mass radius. This can be\nseen in Fig. 7 (top) towards the end of the expansion and it\ncontinues into the early part of the contraction phase (Fig.\n7, bottom).\nThe flux gradient can be related to density via equation (5). As the heavier component dominates in the inner\nregions (see Fig. 8), the main contribution to the flux is from\nthe heavier component (i.e. L \u223c L2 ). Outside the core the\nenergy generation will be negligible. Finally, the temporal\nchange in ln \u03c1 is greater than that in ln \u03c3 3 . Taking all of this\ninto account and rearranging equation (5) will result in the\nfollowing:\n1\nr2 \u03c1\n\n2\n2 \u03c32\n\n\u0010 D \u0011 \u0010\u03c1 \u0011 \u0010 D \u0011 \u0010 \u0011\n\u2202L\n2\nln\n'\nln \u03c12 .\n'\n\u2202r\nDt\n\u03c323\nDt\n\n(9)\n\nSince all of the coefficients of the flux gradient are positive the sign of flux gradient must be the same as that of the\nLagrangian derivative of the density. Thus a positive radial\nflux gradient in space implies that the density is increasing\nwith time. This can be seen in Fig. 6, where the dashed\nlines mark the moment when the contraction becomes an\nexpansion, and the solid lines mark the time when contraction resumes. It is clear that the contraction begins at large\nradii (log r & \u22121.6) while the core is expanding, and that\nthis region of contraction propagates inwards at later times.\nThis can be related to the position of the positive gradient\nin Fig. 7 via the above equation (as long as the density is low\nenough that energy generation is negligible). Therefore, the\ncollapse of the parts of the cluster between the core and rh\nstarts while the core is expanding, and brings the expansion\nto a halt. Note that Fig. 6 is density plotted at fixed radius\nwhereas time-derivatives in equation 9 are at fixed mass.\n1\n\nStrictly, only periodic if one scales out the steady expansion\n\n\fGravothermal oscillations\n\n7\n\nExpansion phase from 24.54t i,rh to 25.18t i,rh\n\nlog \u03c1 at fixed values of log r\n0.4\n\n5\n\n0.35\n\nTime\n\n4\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n\nL\n\nlog \u03c1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.05\n0\n0\n\u22120.05\n\u22124\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r\n\nTime (t i,rh )\n\nCollapse phase from 25.18t i,rh to 26.57t i,rh\n\nContour plot of log \u03c1 over log r vs T ime\n0.4\n0.35\n\n\u22121\n\n0.3\n\u22121.2\n\n\u22121.6\n\n\u22121.8\n\n\u22122\n\n0.25\n\nion\nact\nntr\n\n0.2\n\nL\n\non\nnsi\npa\n\nlog r\n\nco\n\nex\n\n\u22121.4\n\nTime\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n24\n\n24.5\n\n25\n\n25.5\n\n26\n\n26.5\n\n27\n\nTime (t i,rh )\n\nFigure 6.

Furthermore, another reason for its inclusion\nis that the evolution of isolated two-component models is\nan interesting research topic in its own right, and with the\naim of constructing a comprehensive approximate theory of\nthese models, studying the core collapse time is an appropriate first step.\nThe core collapse time tcc for a one-component cluster\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r\n\nFigure 7.

Takahashi (1995) found\na longer tcc of 17.6ti,rh with a one-component anisotropic\nFokker-Planck code. However, the presence of a range of stellar masses can have a dramatic effect on the collapse time because of the process of mass segregation. The effect of mass\nsegregation in multi-component models has been studied using Fokker-Planck calculations (Murphy et al 1990; Chernoff\n& Weinberg 1990) and Monte Carlo methods (G\u00fcrkan et\nal 2004). The effect of mass segregation in two-component\nmodels has already been studied extensively using direct N body methods (Khalisi et al 2007).\nFor the gas model runs discussed in Section 3, Table 7\ngives the values of the collapse time in units of the initial\nhalf mass relaxation time. Fig. 9 shows a contour plot of log\n2\ntcc . The fastest collapse times occur with models of low M\nM1\nm2\nand high m1 .\nFor two-component systems, the timescale of mass segm2 \u22121\nregation varies as ( m\n) (Fregeau et al 2002, and references\n1\ntherein). As mass segregation enhances the central density, it\nis expected that the mass segregation timescale is comparable with the timescale of core collapse. Fig. 10 compares the\nvariation of the timescale of core collapse with the expected\n2\ntimescale of mass segregation. For the case of M\n= 1.0 (top\nM1\nline in Fig. 10) the collapse time indeed appears to vary as\n2 \u22121\n2\n(m\n) . However, for lower values of M\n, the core collapse\nm1\nM1\n\n\f8\n\nP. G.

Khalisi et al\n1\n(2007) also found a steeper decrease of the core collapse time\n2\nin their study, for the case MM\n= 0.1, where Mi,tot is the\ni,tot\ninitial total cluster mass.\nWe can attempt to improve on these ideas at least qualitatively by considering in more detail a Spitzer unstable\nmodel. In that case, we can separate the pre-collapse evolution of the cluster into an initial mass segregation-dominated\nstage and a later gravothermal collapse-dominated stage, in\nwhich the centrally concentrated heavy component behaves\nalmost as a one-component system thermally detached from\nthe lighter component. We propose that this separation can\nbe located via the minimum\n\b d of\u03c12 the\n\u0001 rate of change of cen). The reasoning behind\ntral density ratio (i.e min dt\n\u03c11\nthis is as follows: as time passes, the increase in the den-\n\nsity ratio caused by mass segregation starts to slow due to\na combination of decreasing relative density and increasing\ntemperature of the lighter component in the central regions.\nWe assume that it is at this point that the gravothermal\ncollapse of the heavier component becomes the dominant\nbehaviour of the system. The gravothermal collapse in the\nheavy component increases the temperature of the heavy\ncomponent, and because the light component absorbs energy from the heavy component, the collapse of the heavy\ncomponent causes a deceleration in the collapse of the light\ncomponent. This in turn enhances the rate of increase in the\ndensity ratio.\nFig. 11 shows the density ratio \u03c12 /\u03c11 vs time for N =\nM2\n2\n= 1, 0.1. For the case of m\n= 2 (the lowest\n10000 and M\nm1\n1\ncurve) there is a clear distinction between the part before\nt\n= 5 (i.e the initial mass\nthe point of inflection at about ti,rh\nsegregation phase) and the part after the point of inflection\n2\n(i.e the gravothermal collapse phase). As m\nincreases the\nm1\ninitial phase dominated by mass segregation becomes more\nsubstantial and eventually the initial mass segregation phase\nbrings the system all the way to core bounce. However, as N\nincreases, binary energy generation becomes less efficient relative to the energy demands of the cluster (Goodman 1987).\nTherefore, the core needs to reach a higher density at core\nbounce for larger N . As the initial phase of mass segregation is self limiting for the reason given above, mass segregation cannot increase the central density beyond a certain\npoint. Therefore, it would be expected that the gravothermal collapse dominated phase must eventually return with\nM2\nm2\nincreasing N for any given M\nand m\n.\n1\n1\n\n5\n\nDIRECT N -BODY\n\nBettwieser & Sugimoto (1985) compared N -body systems\nto gaseous models using a direct N = 1000 model. Even\nthough the value of N is small by today's standards there\nwas still fair agreement during the pre-collapse phase. There\nwere large statistical fluctuations in the post-collapse phase\nand this was most likely due to the small particle number.\n\n\fGravothermal oscillations\n\n9\n\nTable 8.

The values of N used for\nthese runs were 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. The collapse times of\nthe runs in N -body units (see Heggie & Mathieu 1986) and\nunits of ti,rh are given in Table 8. The average collapse time\nmeasured in units of ti,rh is about 7.5 which is lower than the\npredicted value of 8.95 in Table 7. The difference in collapse\ntime could be because of the approximate treatment of twobody relaxation in the gas model, the neglect of escape, or\nparameter choices in the gas code (Section 2.1).\nFor the case of the runs with N equal to 8k and 16k no\nbehaviour was found which could be described as gravothermal oscillation. This is in agreement with the gas code, which\ngave Ncrit = 17000. However, the 32k case does show a cycle of expansion and contraction of the core over the time\ninterval 4500 to 5500 N -body units (see Fig. 12). In order to\ncheck that the expansion was not driven by sustained binary\nenergy generation, we consider the evolution of the relative\nbinding energy EEb , where Eb is the total binding energy of\nthe binaries and E is the absolute value of the total energy\nof the cluster, over this time period. This is plotted in Fig.\n13 along with the core radius. There are small changes in the\nbinding energy of binaries over this period, decreases as well\nas increases, but this cannot fully account for the expansion\nphase that is observed, as there are other periods with similar binary activity in which no sustained expansion occurs.\nAlso, the time scale of the expansion is much longer than the\nrelaxation time in the core (\u223c 0.5 in N -body time units).\nTherefore, we assume that the expansion must be driven by\n\n\f10\n\nP.

It can be seen that the collapse at 5400 starts further\nout (while the core is still expanding) and propagates towards the\ncore.\n\nvisible towards the end of this expansion and this is what is\ndriving the expansion. From the results of the 32k and 64k\nruns it seems that the value of Ncrit = 17000 obtained by\nthe gas code is a reasonable indicator of stability for the N body case in the sense that none of the signs of gravothermal\nbehaviour were found for N . 16k.\n\n6\n\nFigure 13. 32k N -body results.

As discussed in Section 3.3 (e.g. Fig. 6, top) the\nregion further away from the core is seen to contract while\nthe core expands. Also, in the cycle of ln \u03c1c vs the core velocity dispersion log vc2 , the temperature is lower during the\nexpansion where heat is absorbed and higher during the collapse where heat is released (Fig. 13, bottom). This is similar\nto the cycles found by Makino (1996) for one-component\nmodels and is another sign of gravothermal behaviour. The\nresults from the 32k gas run are shown in Fig. 15 for comparison.\nThe 64k run shown in Figs. 16 and 17 has large amplitude oscillations. There is a part of the expansion which is\nshown in Fig. 17 between 7353 and 7390 in which the relative binding energy of binaries is nearly constant. Therefore\nbinary activity cannot be what is driving the expansion. Fig.\n17 (bottom) shows the evolution of the profile of log v 2 over\npart of the expansion. A negative temperature gradient is\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe main focus of this paper has been on the gravothermal\noscillations of two-component systems. The critical value of\nN for the onset of instability has been found for a range of\nstellar mass ratios and total mass ratios using a gas model.\nM2\n2\n= 1 and m\n= 2 was further investigated\nThe case of M\nm1\n1\nusing the direct N -body code NBODY6. The value of Ncrit\nobtained from the gas code seems to be a good indicator for\nstability in N -body runs for this case. Based on this, it is\na reasonable assumption that the other Ncrit values would\ngive an indication of the stability for direct N -body systems.\nThe values of Ncrit for the two-component model were found\nto be much higher than for the one-component case and\n2\n2\nwere found to vary with m\nand M\n. However, the value of\nm1\nM1\nN2 at the stability limit was found to vary much less than\nN itself. This seems to suggest that instability depends on\nthe properties of the heavy component (see 3.2). A possible\nexplanation of this is given in Section 3.2.\nThe physical manifestation of the oscillations was investigated for the case of small-amplitude periodic oscillations\nin the gas model. It has been pointed out that the collapse\nof the region between rc and rh is an important mechanism which can halt the expansion phase of a gravothermal\noscillation. This mechanism should also be present in onecomponent models and it would be an interesting topic for\nfuture work to see how this mechanism would behave with\ndifferent stellar mass functions.\nKim, Lee & Goodman (1998) argued that twocomponent clusters may be realistic approximations of\n\n\fGravothermal oscillations\n\n11\n\n64k nbody run\n0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n\nlog r c\n\n\u22121.5\n\u22122\n\u22122.5\n\u22123\n\n\u22123.5\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\nTime (N-body units)\nFigure 15.

The initial\nbottom: log \u03c12,c vs log v2,c\n2 results from the two components trying to achieve\ndrop in log v2,c\nthermal equilibrium\n\nmulti-component clusters, where the two components are\nneutron stars and main sequence stars and the effect of\nwhite dwarfs (heavier than the turnoff mass) was assumed\nto be negligible. They also only studied cases that were\nSpitzer stable, which means that the components were able\nto achieve equipartition of kinetic energy. For the twocomponent case, it is only possible for it to be Spitzer stable\nif there is only a small amount of the heavier component\npresent. As there is a significant range of stellar masses in\na real star cluster, it is likely that some form of the Spitzer\ninstability will be present.\nTo apply our ideas to a multi-component system, it may\nbe possible to group the heavier components together if they\nare able to achieve approximate thermal equilibrium. This\ncould be considered as a single heavier component which is\nSpitzer unstable with respect to the remaining components.\nThis would help to reduce a multi-component system to the\ntwo-component case studied in this paper.\nNevertheless, it is not clear quantitatively how the considerations of this research are to be applied to a multi-\n\nFigure 16. 64k N -body run.

Furthermore, we have ignored many\nthings such as primordial binaries, tidal fields and stellar\nevolution and these are important in the evolution of a real\nstar cluster. Further study is needed in order to understand\nthe phenomenon that is gravothermal oscillation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are indebted to S. Aarseth and K.
