In addition to a wealth of possible ground-state phases [1\u20134], the spinor dynamics has been\nat the focus of major interest [5, 6]. This dynamics results\nfrom spin-changing collisions, which coherently re-distribute\nthe populations among the different Zeeman states. Interestingly, spin-changing collisions are typically characterized by a\nvery low energy scale much lower than the chemical potential\nin the condensate. As a result of that, the spinor dynamics in\nalkaline gases may be extraordinarily sensitive to other small\nenergy scales.\nUp to very recently, only short-range interactions have\nplayed a role in typical experiments in ultra-cold gases. Recent experiments have started to unveil the rich physics resulting from the dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) [8, 9]. This\nis particularly the case of Chromium, which presents a relatively large magnetic dipole moment, \u03bc = 6\u03bcB . Remarkable effects of the magnetic DDI have been reported in recent\nexperiments on Chromium BEC [10\u201313]. Alkaline atoms,\non the contrary, present a much lower magnetic dipole moment, \u03bc = \u03bcB /2, and hence they are not usually expected\nto show any trace of the DDI unless short-range interactions\nare switched-off by means of Feshbach resonances [14, 15].\nHowever, as mentioned above, the spin-changing collisions in\nalkaline spinor BECs (in particular F = 1 87 Rb) are remarkably low-energetic. As a result, spinor dynamics is very sensitive to magnetic DDI, in spite of the very low magnetic dipole\nmoment. Recent experiments [16] have shown that the DDI\nmay induce magnetization patterns in F = 1 87 Rb BECs.\nSpinor dynamics is particularly interesting for the case of\ncondensates initially prepared in the m = 0 Zeeman sublevel.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: fdeuretz@itp.uni-hannover.de\n\nIn that case, spin-changing collisions may lead to correlated\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs in m = \u00b11 [17, 18],\nin a process which closely resembles parametric down conversion in non-linear optics [19]. As a result, spinor condensates may act as parametric amplifiers of matter waves [20\u2013\n22], opening interesting perspectives for the creation of nonclassical states of matter based on spinor BECs. Recently\nwe have shown that the interplay between trapping potential,\nquadratic Zeeman effect (QZE) and spin-changing collisions\ncrucially determines the amplification gain [21] and its sensitivity with respect to quantum spin fluctuations [22].\nIn this paper we show that the amplification dynamics may\nbe extremely sensitive to the DDI. As a result of that, the amplification of EPR-like pairs is strongly modified by the relative orientation between the applied magnetic field and the\ntrap axis. We analyze in detail this dependence, as well as the\neffects of magnetic-field gradients. We show that these gradients must be carefully controlled, since uncontrolled gradients\nmay obscure the expected DDI effects. We finally comment\non experimental requirements.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\npresent the system considered and the corresponding Hamiltonian. The linear regime is discussed in Sec. III. An intuitive\nqualitative picture of the effects of the DDI in the amplification dynamics is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we introduce\nthe main formalism to analyze the amplification dynamics in\nthe presence of DDI, whereas the corresponding numerical results are presented in Sec. VI. The effects of the magneticfield gradient are analyzed in Sec. VII. Finally we discuss\nexperimental requirements and summarize our conclusions in\nSec. VIII.\n\nII.\n\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nIn the following we consider a spin-1 Bose gas (e.g. F = 1\nRb), with Zeeman components m = 0, \u00b11, confined in\na dipole trap in the presence of an external magnetic field\n(which we assume as oriented along the z-axis). The system\nis described by the Hamiltonian \u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124sr + \u0124dd . In this\n\n87\n\n\f2\nHamiltonian, the single-particle physics is described by\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nZ\nX\n~ \u2206\n\u2020\n3\n\u03c8\u0302m (~r) \u2212\n\u01240 = d r\n+V (~r)+EZ (m) \u03c8\u0302m (~r), (1)\n2M\nm\nwhere \u03c8\u0302m annihilates bosons with spin projection\nm. The\n\u0010\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u03c9\nx\n+\ny \u20322 +\ntrapping potential is of the form V (~r) = M\n\u22a5\n2\n\u0011\n\u03c9k2 z \u20322 , where M is the atomic mass, \u03c9k \u226a \u03c9\u22a5 are the trap\n\nfrequencies (cigar-shaped trap), and y \u2032 = cos \u03b8 y + sin \u03b8 z,\nz \u2032 = \u2212 sin \u03b8 y + cos \u03b8 z, with \u03b8 the angle between the trap\naxis and the magnetic field orientation. This angle will play a\ncrucial role in our discussion of the effects of the DDI.\nThe Zeeman energy for the m component is of the form:\nEZ (m) \u2243 (p + \u2207p * ~r ) m + qm2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p = gL \u03bcB B0 characterizes the linear Zeeman effect (LZE) for a homogeneous magnetic field B0 , with gL\nthe Land\u00e9 factor (gL = \u22121/2 for F = 1 87 Rb) and \u03bcB\nthe Bohr magneton. The quadratic Zeeman effect (QZE) is\ncharacterized by a constant q, which in principle depends as\nq = \u03bc2B B02 /(8Chfs ) on the hyperfine coupling strength Chfs\n(\u2248 h \u00d7 3.4 GHz for 87 Rb), but may be also externally modified using optical or micro-wave dressing [23, 24]. Addition~ * ~r,\nally, we allow for a magnetic field gradient B = B0 + \u2207B\n~\nleading to an energy shift m\u2207p *~r, which plays a relevant role\nbelow.\nThe short-range interactions are given by:\nZ\nX\n1\n\u2020\nm\u0304\u2032 ,m\u0304\n\u2020\n\u0124sr =\nd3 r\n\u03c8\u0302m\n(~r)\u03c8\u0302m\nr )\u03c8\u0302m\u0304 (~r), (3)\nr )Um,m\n\u2032 (~\n\u2032 \u03c8\u0302m\u0304\u2032 (~\n2\nm,m\u2032\nm\u0304\u2032 ,m\u0304\n\n\u2032\n\nm\u0304 ,m\u0304\nwith Um,m\n\u2261 U0 \u03b4m,m\u0304 \u03b4m\u2032 ,m\u0304\u2032 + U1 f~mm\u0304 * f~m\u2032 m\u0304\u2032 , where\n\u2032\ny\nx\nz\nT\nf~mm\u2032 = (fmm\n\u2032 , fmm\u2032 , fmm\u2032 ) , with fx,y,z the spin-1 matrices. U0 = (g0 + 2g2 )/3 and U1 = (g2 \u2212 g0 )/3 are, respectively, the coupling constants for spin-independent and\nspin-dependent interactions, where gF = 4\u03c0~2 aF /M , with\naF the s-wave scattering length for the channel with total spin\nF . Note that the short-range interactions preserve the total\nspin projection, but this may be done in two crucially different ways, either by preserving the individual spin projections (spin-preserving collisions) or by modifying the individual projections while preserving the total one (spin-changing\ncollisions).\nFinally, the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is given by:\nZ\nZ\nX\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u0302m\n(~r)\u03c8\u0302m\n\u0124dd =\nr \u2032)\nd3 r d3 r\u2032\n\u2032 (~\n2\nm,m\u2032\nm\u0304\u2032 ,m\u0304\n\n\u2032\n\nm\u0304 ,m\u0304\nWm,m\nr \u2212 ~r \u2032 )\u03c8\u0302m\u0304\u2032 (~r \u2032 )\u03c8\u0302m\u0304 (~r),\n\u2032 (~\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u2032\n\nh\nd2\nf~mm\u0304 * f~m\u2032 m\u0304\u2032\n|~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 |3\n\u0011i\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\n\u2212 3 f~mm\u0304 * ~ur f~m\u2032 m\u0304\u2032 * ~ur , (5)\n\nm\u0304 ,m\u0304\nWm,m\nr \u2212 ~r \u2032 ) \u2261\n\u2032 (~\n\n2 2\n\u03bcB /(4\u03c0), \u03bc0 is the vacuum permeability,\nwhere d2 = \u03bc0 gL\nand ~ur = (~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 )/|~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 |. Contrary to the short-range interactions the DDI may violate, in principle, the conservation\nof the total spin projection (they may induce the equivalent of\nthe Einstein-de Haas effect [25, 26]). However, the associated\nchange in LZE is typically, even for very low magnetic fields,\norders of magnitude larger than any energy in the system and\nhence these spin-violating processes can be safely considered\nas suppressed.\nSince short-range interactions preserve spin projection, and\nso do in practice DDI as well, the homogeneous LZE (pm)\nis preserved and it may be gauged out, playing no role in the\ndynamics discussed below. The same argument cannot be,\nhowever, employed with the magnetic-field gradient which\nmay play a significant role in the spinor dynamics [27], as\ndiscussed in Sec. VII.\n\nIII.\n\nLINEAR REGIME\n\nIn the following we are interested in the first stages (linear regime) of the spinor dynamics of a spin-1 BEC initially\nprepared in the m = 0 sublevel, after quenching q into the unstable regime. This dynamics, induced by spin-changing collisions, is characterized by the correlated creation of atomic\npairs in m = \u00b11. In this section, and for the sake of simplicity, we do not consider magnetic-field gradients, which will\nbe introduced in Sec. VII.\nBefore quenching q, the BEC is prepared in the m = 0\ncomponent. The initial scalar wavefunction \u03c80 of the BEC in\nm = 0 and the corresponding chemical potential \u03bc may be obtained from the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n~2\n\u2212\n\u2206 + V (~r) + U0 n0 (~r) \u03c80 (~r) = \u03bc\u03c80 (~r), (6)\n2M\nR\nwith n0 (~r) = |\u03c80 (~r)|2 , and d3 r|\u03c80 (~r)|2 = N .\nThe first stages of the spinor dynamics may be described by\nmeans of a Bogoliubov approximation:\nh\ni\n(\u03c8\u03021 , \u03c8\u03020 , \u03c8\u0302\u22121 )T = (0, \u03c80 , 0)T + (\u03b4 \u03c8\u03021 , \u03b4 \u03c8\u03020 , \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121 )T e\u2212i\u03bct .\n(7)\nwhere we consider small fluctuations of the spinor field operP\n\u2020\n\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302m i.\nator {\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302m }, such that |\u03c80 |2 \u226b m h\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302m\nA. Hamiltonian without dipole-dipole interactions\n\nWe consider first the Hamiltonian without DDI.

In the previous expression we have introduced\n\u0124ef f \u2261 \u2212~2 \u2206/2M + Vef f (~r), where\nVef f (~r) = V (~r) + (U0 + U1 )n0 (~r) \u2212 \u03bc\n\n(9)\n\nmay be understood as the effective trapping potential felt by\nthe \u00b11-fluctuations on top of the m = 0 BEC. It contains the\nmean-field potential (U0 +U1 )n0 , which originates from spinpreserving collisions of \u00b11-atoms with the BEC in m = 0.\nNote that in the Thomas-Fermi regime \u03bc = V (~r) + U0 n0 (~r).\nIn that regime, Vef f (~r) = U1 n0 (~r) within the BEC region,\nand Vef f = V (~r) \u2212 \u03bc outside.\nThe second line in Eq. (8) originates from spin-changing\ncollisions, which convert m = 0 atoms into \u00b11-atom pairs\nand vice-versa. Interestingly, this process resembles parametric down conversion in optical parametric amplifiers [19]. Indeed, if the m = 0 BEC is unstable after the quench of q,\nspin-changing collisions lead to an exponential amplification\nof the population in m = \u00b11 [20\u201322].\n\nB. Dipole-dipole interactions\n\nAs mentioned above, spin-changing collisions are typically\ncharacterized by a very low energy scale. As a result, the\nspinor physics is highly sensitive to other very low energy\nscales, including the rather weak magnetic DDI in alkaline\ngases. This sensitivity has been recently demonstrated in\nexperiments on the formation of spatial magnetization patterns in spinor Rb BECs [16]. As we show in following sections, also the exponential amplification of the population in\nm = \u00b11 following a quench in q may be very significantly\nmodified by the DDI.\nAlthough there is no DDI contribution in the GP Eq. (6),\nsince f~00 = 0, there is however an important contribution\nto the effective Hamiltonian for \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u00b11 which we obtain after\ninserting (7) in \u0124dd and linearizing:\n\u01241,dd =\n\nZ\n\nZ\nd3 r d3 r\u2032 \u03c80 (~r)\u03c80 (~r \u2032 )Vdd (~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 )\n\u0014\n\u2020\n(~r)\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121 (~r \u2032 )\n\u00d7 \u03b4 \u03c8\u03021\u2020 (~r)\u03b4 \u03c8\u03021 (~r \u2032 ) + \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121\n\u0015\n\u2020\n+ \u03b4 \u03c8\u03021\u2020 (~r)\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121\n(~r \u2032 ) + \u03b4 \u03c8\u03021 (~r)\u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121 (~r \u2032 ) (10)\n\n\u0001\nd2\n2\nwith Vdd (~r) = 2|~\nr |2 . In Eq. (10) we have ner |5 3z \u2212 |~\nglected terms related to scattering processes which do not preserve the total spin projection since, as mentioned in Sec. II,\nthe associated change in LZE suppresses spin-violating processes even for very low magnetic fields. Note that the third\nline of \u01241,dd contains as well a parametric amplification term.\n\nIV. QUALITATIVE PICTURE OF THE EFFECT OF THE\nDIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTIONS ON THE\nAMPLIFICATION DYNAMICS\n\nThe effects of the DDI on the amplification dynamics may\nbe qualitatively understood from a simplified model. In homogeneous space (V = 0, constant n0 , \u03bc = U0 n0 ) we may inR\n~\ntroduce the Fourier transform \u03b7\u0302m (~k) = d3 r \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302m (~r)e\u2212ik*~r ,\nwhich allows\nto write \u01241 in the simplified form [28]:\nR\nH1hom = \u0125k d3 k/(2\u03c0)3 , where\nX\n\u2020 ~\n\u0125k =\n(Ek + q \u2212 qcr ) \u03b7m\n(k)\u03b7m (~k)\nm=\u00b11\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n\u2212 qcr \u03b7\u03021\u2020 (~k)\u03b7\u0302\u22121\n(\u2212~k) + \u03b7\u03021 (~k)\u03b7\u0302\u22121 (\u2212~k) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwith Ek = ~2 k 2 /2M and qcr = \u2212U1 n0 . Note that for F = 1\n87\nRb U1 < 0, and hence qcr > 0 (we consider in the following\nthis case, although for the F = 2 case the sign is the opposite).\nThis Hamiltonian, which may be easily diagonalized for each\nmomentum ~k, possesses eigenenergies of the form\np\n2 .\n(12)\n\u03bb\u00b1 (~k) = (Ek + q \u2212 qcr )2 \u2212 qcr\n\nNote that if Im(\u03bb\u00b1 (~k)) > 0 for some eigenenergy, then there\nis an exponential growth of spin excitations, which leads to a\ncorrelated pair creation in m = \u00b11. This instability is best\ncharacterized by the instability rate \u039b = max{Im(\u03bb\u00b1 (~k))}.\nIt is straightforward to show that the m = 0 BEC becomes\nunstable for q < 2qcr . The instability rate rises between\nqcr < q < 2qcr acquiring its maximal value \u039b = qcr at\nq = qcr . For q < qcr , \u039b = qcr in the homogeneous case\n(in the inhomogeneously trapped case the instability rate \u039b\npresents significant modulations which are responsible of the\nmulti-resonant q-dependence of the amplification dynamics\nrecently observed experimentally [21]).\nIn the following we apply a similar formalism to the DDI\nterm \u01241,dd . We introduce the Fourier transformation of\nVdd (~r) to obtain \u1e7cdd (~k) = Udd (1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8), where Udd =\n2\u03c0d2 /3 and \u03b8 is the angle between ~k and the dipole orientation\n(z axis). Using convolution theorem, and since we assume n0\nas constant, we may then rewrite \u01241,dd in the form:\n(\nZ\n3\nX\nd\nk\nhom\n\u2020 ~\n~k)\n\u1e7c\n(\n\u01241,dd\n=\nn\n\u03b7\u0302m\n(k)\u03b7\u0302m (~k)\ndd\n0\n(2\u03c0)3\nm=\u00b11\no\n\u2020 ~\n\u2020\n~\n+ \u03b7\u03021 (k)\u03b7\u0302\u22121 (\u2212k) + \u03b7\u03021 (~k)\u03b7\u0302\u22121 (\u2212~k) .\n(13)\nNote that adding H1,dd to H1 results in a similar form as that\nef f\nof \u01241 but with an effective qcr\n(\u03b8) = qcr \u2212 n0 \u1e7cdd (~k). Note\nef f\nthat, due to the anisotropy of the DDI, qcr\ndepends on the\nangle \u03b8. The effects of the trap geometry may be qualitatively\nunderstood from this \u03b8 dependence. For an axisymmetric trap\nthe dominant momenta are those along the tightest direction.\nIf the dipole orientation is perpendicular to the trap axis, then\nthe dominant ~k will then be those with \u03b8 = 0, and hence\nef f\nqcr\n\u2243 qcr + 2n0 Udd . On the contrary, if the dipole orientation is parallel to the trap axis, the dominant momenta will\n\n\f4\nR\nwhere Ann\u2032 = U1 d3 r n0 \u03c6n \u03c6n\u2032 characterizes the effects of\nthe short-range spin-changing collisions, whereas the effects\nof the DDI are given by\nZ\nZ\n(15)\nBnn\u2032 = d3 r d3 r\u2032 Fn (~r)Vdd (~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 )Fn\u2032 (~r\u2032 ),\n\ninstability rate/h (Hz)\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\nwhere Fn (~r) = \u03c80 (~r)\u03c6n (~r).

Since\nef f\n\u039b \u2243 qcr , we hence expect an enhancement of the instability for a magnetic field orientation perpendicular to the trap\naxis, and a reduced instability for a parallel orientation. Although the DDI in alkaline atoms is typically very weak, the\nspin-changing collisions are very weak as well. In particular, in F = 1 87 Rb the strength of the DDI is quite significant compared to the strength of the spin-changing collisions,\n|Udd /U1 | \u2248 0.2. As a result, the DDI modification of the\ninstability rate is expected to lead to a marked orientation dependence of the amplification dynamics. In the following sections we show that this is indeed the case when considering\nrealistic trapped cases.\n\nV.\n\nAMPLIFICATION DYNAMICS IN TRAPPED DIPOLAR\nCONDENSATES\n\nAlthough the homogeneous model discussed before allows\nfor a simplified intuitive understanding of the major effects\nof the DDI in the amplification process, a quantitative analysis of realistic experimental situations may be just achieved\nby properly considering the inhomogeneous trapping, and the\ncorresponding inhomogeneous density n0 (~r) of the m = 0\nBEC. In this section we introduce the basic formalism which\nwe follow for the analysis of the amplification dynamics characterizing the spinor physics in the linear regime.\nThe analysis of the spinor dynamics is significantly simplified by considering the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of \u0124ef f , \u0124ef f \u03c6n (~r) = \u01ebn \u03c6n (~r), and expanding the\nfield\nP operators in the basis of these eigenstates \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302m (~r) =\nr )\u00e2nm .

As for the homogeneous case, this instability is best\ncharacterized by the instability rate \u039b = max{Im(\u03bb\u00b1\n\u03bd )}.\nThe time evolution of \u00e2n,\u00b11 is then easily obtained\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n{\u00e2n1 (t)}\n{\u00e2n1 (0)}\n= U(t)\n,\n(20)\n{\u00e2\u2020n\u22121 (t)}\n{\u00e2\u2020n\u22121 (0)}\nwith U = M\u22121 e\u2212i\u039bt/~ M, where M is the matrix of eigenvectors obtained after solving Eq. (18) and \u039b the corresponding diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\nAs mentioned above, the atoms are initially prepared in the\nm = 0 sublevel. However, a slightly imperfect preparation\nmay lead to a non-zero population of Ns m = \u00b11 pairs in the\noriginal BEC [22]. These spurious atoms (which from now are\ncalled classical seed) share the same\n\u221a0 (~r) as\nR wavefunction \u03c8\nthe m = 0 atoms. Denoting \u03c7n = d3 r\u03c80 (~r)\u03c6n (~r)/ N , we\nP\nmay then easily express the population Pm = n h\u00e2\u2020n,m \u00e2n,m i\nin the form Pm (t) = PC (t) + PQ (t), where\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne \u2020O\ne \u03c7\nPC (t) = Ns \u03c7\n~ * O\u2020 O + O\n~,\n(21)\ndenotes the population triggered by the classical seed, and\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne \u2020O\ne ,\n(22)\nPQ (t) = Tr O\ndenotes the population induced by quantum fluctuations (i.e.\nwhen Ns = 0).

DIPOLE-INDUCED ORIENTATION-DEPENDENCE OF\nTHE AMPLIFICATION DYNAMICS\n\nIn this section we employ the formalism discussed in Sec. V\nto study the effects of the DDI in the amplification dynamics.\nWe shall show that due to the DDI the amplification may be\nmarkedly dependent on the relative orientation between the\ntrap axis and the external magnetic field.\nIn our numerical calculations we have considered realistic\nexperimental conditions, with N = 105 F = 1 87 Rb atoms in\na cigar-shaped harmonic potential with \u03c9\u22a5 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 200 Hz,\nand \u03c9k = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 40 Hz. As mentioned above, we consider\nthe atoms as initially prepared in m = 0 with possibly an\ninitial spurious classical seed (which we typically consider as\nNs = 2, a typical value expected from previous experimental\nresults [22]). At t = 0 the QZE energy q is set to a given value\nwithin the instability regime. We monitor the subsequent evolution of the populations P\u00b11 (t) obtained from Eqs. (21) and\n(22) as a function of q and the relative angle \u03b8 between the\ntrap axis and the external magnetic field.\nFig. 1 shows the dependence of the instability rate \u039b as a\nfunction of q for \u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and without DDI. Note that\nfor all cases, the instability rate experiences a maximum contrary to the homogeneous case. This maximum is induced by\nthe inhomogeneous harmonic trapping and leads to marked\nresonances in the q-dependence of the amplification dynamics, as discussed in Ref. [21]. However, \u039b clearly depends on\nthe trap orientation confirming indeed the intuitive qualitative\npicture discussed in Sec. IV. When trap axis and magnetic\nfield are aligned \u039b decreases compared to the non-dipolar\ncase, whereas the opposite is true when the magnetic field is\noriented perpendicular to the trap axis. Note as well that, also\nas expected from the qualitative picture of Sec. IV, the instability region is shifted towards lower q values in the parallel\nconfiguration, and towards larger q values in the perpendicular\none.\nThis modified instability rate translates into a significantly\ndistorted pair-creation dynamics, due to the exponential na-\n\nmaximum fraction of atoms in m = 1 (%)\n\n5\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n50\nangle (deg)\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Maximal population transfer after 115 ms as\na function of \u03b8 (same parameters as Fig. 2) for different magnetic\nfield gradients \u2207B = 0 (blue, solid), 5 mG/cm (black, dashed) and\n10 mG/cm (red, dot-dashed).\n\nture of the parametric amplification. Fig. 2 shows the transferred fraction P\u00b11 (t)/N after t = 115 ms as a function of\nq for different values of \u03b8. As expected from the form of \u039b\nwe observe the appearance of a maximum for all \u03b8, which\nis slightly shifted (by approximately 1 Hz) towards lower q\nwhen \u03b8 is shifted from \u03c0/2 to 0. However, this maximum is\napproximately four times as large for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 than for \u03b8 = 0.\nThe dependence of the amplification on \u03b8 is very clearly observable in the \u03b8-dependence of the maximum of P\u00b11 (again\nat t = 115 ms) shown in Fig. 3. Note that the maximum grows\nmonotonically from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\nVII. EFFECTS OF MAGNETIC FIELD GRADIENTS ON\nTHE AMPLIFICATION DYNAMICS\n\nAs mentioned in Sec. II the homogeneous LZE plays typically no role in the spinor dynamics (only at very low magnetic fields B < 1 mG the DDI could induce the equivalent\nof the Einstein-de Haas effect [25, 26], and in this case the\nresidual LZE could play a role). However, magnetic field gradients cannot be gauged out, and may play a relevant role in\nthe spinor physics [27]. In this section, we analyze the effects\nthat these gradients may have on the amplification dynamics.\nWe shall show that even relatively weak gradients may have a\nsignificant effect on the amplification process.\nAlthough magnetic-field gradients do not affect the GP\nequation for the m = 0 BEC, there is indeed a contribution\nto the effective Hamiltonian for \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u00b11 in the linear regime:\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2020\n(23)\n\u01241,gr = \u2207p * d3 r \u03b4 \u03c8\u03021\u2020~r \u03b4 \u03c8\u03021 \u2212 \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121\n~r \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302\u22121 ,\nwhich may be straightforwardly implemented into the matrix\nC of the eigenvalue equation (18),\n\u0015\n\u0014\nE + q1 + B + D\n\u2212A + B)\n,\n(24)\nC=\nA+B\n\u2212E \u2212 q1 \u2212 B + D\nR\nwith Dnn\u2032 = \u2207p * d3 r \u03c6n~r \u03c6n\u2032 .\n\n\f6\n\nfraction of atoms in m = 1 (%)\n\n8\n\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n7\n\nA.

On one\nside, they modify the effective potential Vef f (~r) in a different\nway for m = 1 than for m = \u22121. This reduces the overlap of\nthe m = \u00b11 atom clouds with the m = 0 BEC and hence\nthe scattering mediated transfer. On the other side, atoms\nplaced at different locations experience different Larmor precession frequencies. Although this does not affect the local\nshort-range interactions, it does modify the non-local DDI.\nFor large-enough gradients this may lead to a time-averaged\nDDI [27]. For weak gradients, as those considered below, the\nexplicit time dependence induced by the gradients must be\nconsidered.\nParametric amplification is handicapped by the presence of\ngradients as a result of these two combined effects. Fig. 4\nshows the combined effect of the DDI and the magnetic-field\ngradient along the weak trap axis for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. As expected,\nwe obtain a reduction of the transfer maximum with increasing gradient and a shift of its position to lower q/h by approximately 1.5 Hz for a gradient of 10 mG/cm. Hence the transfer\nmaximum is shifted down and to lower q with decreasing \u03b8\nand increasing gradient. As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence\nof a magnetic field gradient the maximum of P\u00b11 (t) shows\nalso a marked \u03b8 dependence.\nHence, even rather weak gradients (< 10 mG/cm) may\nstrongly modify the amplification dynamics, an effect which is\nenhanced by the presence of the DDI. Although as mentioned\nabove, the \u03b8-dependence should reveal also in the presence\nof gradients the effects of the DDI, slight variations of the\nmagnetic field gradients (of the order of few mG/cm) when\nchanging the magnetic-field orientation with respect to the\ntrap axis must be very carefully controlled. This is indeed\na crucial point, since otherwise, accidental \u03b8-dependences\nof the magnetic-field gradients may obscure the physical \u03b8dependence characteristic of the DDI.\n\nIn the following we outline the general requirements to perform an experiment with F = 1 87 Rb to probe the theoretical\nresults discussed above. A m = 0 BEC must be prepared in a\ncrossed dipole trap following the same procedure detailed in\nRefs. [21, 22]. The state preparation requires particular attention, since remaining atoms in m 6= 0 may strongly alter the\nexperimental result. Previous experiments have shown that\nthe number of atoms in m 6= 0 states can be suppressed to\nNs \u2248 2 by briefly applying a strong magnetic field gradient to\npurify the system [22]. Due to the nature of the QZE in F = 1\n87\nRb, magnetic fields can be used to access positive values of\nq, as required above.\nAs discussed in Sec. VII, the most significant requirement\ncompared to previous experiments is related to the suppression of magnetic field gradients which could obscure the dipolar effects. Appropriate experiments should be carefully designed to minimize all sources of field gradients from the\nvicinity of the atomic sample (alternatively a magnetic shield\ncould be placed around the sample). In state of the art precision measurements, field gradients are commonly suppressed\nbelow 1mG/cm [29], which is sufficient to realize the mandatory experimental conditions (see Sec. VII).\nFig. 2 shows that the resonant spin transfer to the m = \u00b11\nstates depends strongly on the relative orientation of the weak\ntrap axis and the external magnetic field. Since it is difficult\nto change the orientation of a dipole trap while maintaining\nits trapping potential, experiments must be designed to vary\nthe orientation of the external magnetic field. In this sense,\ntwo sets of Helmholtz coils are necessary to provide a homogeneous external magnetic field. One of them should be\nplaced along the weak axis of the trapping potential to realize the \u03b8 = 0 configuration and another one along one of\nthe strong axis to realize the \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 case. Both magnetic fields have to be calibrated, preferentially using precision microwave spectroscopy between the ground state hyperfine manifolds of 87 Rb. Such an experimental apparatus\nwould also allow for a rotation of the field, since the currents\nin the two Helmholtz coils could be adjusted to obtain a relative angle \u03b8. In this way, it should be possible to perform a\nmeasurement analogous to that discussed in Fig. 3. Finally,\nadditional magnetic field gradients can be applied along both\nmagnetic field directions to observe the suppression shown in\nFig. 4.\n\nB. Summary\n\nWe have shown that, in spite of the very small magnetic\nmoment, the magnetic DDI may lead to a strong modification of the amplification dynamics in F = 1 87 Rb due to the\nlow-energy scale of the spin-changing collisions. We have\nshown that the DDI induce a very marked dependence of the\namplification gain with respect to the relative orientation between magnetic-field direction and trap axis. If both directions\n\n\f7\nare perpendicular to each other the amplification dynamics is\nmuch faster than for the parallel configuration. Remarkably,\nthe number of transferred atoms into m = \u00b11 may increase\nfor F = 1 87 Rb for a fixed holding time of around 100 ms by\na factor over 400% when turning from a parallel to a perpendicular configuration. We have shown as well that magnetic\nfield gradients may also significantly modify the amplification\ndynamics, both due to their effects on the trapping and on the\nDDI. As a result, magnetic-field gradients must be carefully\ncontrolled, since uncontrolled changes in the gradient when\nturning the magnetic field orientation may obscure the orienta-\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nT.-L.
