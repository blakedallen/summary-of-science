In 1975 Barker, Donnachie and Storrow published their classical paper\non 'Complete Experiments'. After reconsiderations and careful studies of discrete ambiguities [1, 2, 3], in the 90s it became clear that such a model independent amplitude\nanalysis would require at least 8 polarization observables which have to be carefully\nchosen. There are hundreds of possible combinations, but all of them would require a\npolarized beam and target and in addition also recoil polarization measurements. Technically this was not possible until very recently, when transverse polarized targets came\ninto operation at Mainz, Bonn and JLab and furthermore recoil polarization measurements by nucleon rescattering has been shown to be doable.\n\nCOMPLETE EXPERIMENTS\nA complete experiment is a set of measurements which is sufficient to predict all\nother possible experiments, provided that the measurements are free of uncertainties.\nTherefore it is first of all an academical problem, which can be solved by mathematical\nalgorithms. In practise, however, it will not work in the same way and either a very high\nstatistical precision would be required, which is very unlikely, or further measurements\nof other polarization observables are necessary. Both problems, first the mathematical\nproblem but also the problem for a physical experiment can be studied with the help\nof state-of-the-art models like MAID or partial wave analyses (PWA) like SAID. With\nhigh precision calculations the complete sets of observables can be checked and with\npseudo-data, generated from models and PWA, real experiments can be simulated under\nrealistic conditions.\n\n\fAmplitude analysis\nPseudoscalar meson photoproduction (as \u03b3, \u03c0) has 8 spin degrees of freedom and due\nto parity conservation it can be described by 4 complex amplitudes of 2 kinematical\nvariables. Possible sets of amplitudes are: Invariant amplitudes Ai , CGLN amplitudes\nFi , helicity amplitudes Hi or transversity amplitudes bi . All of them are linearly related\nto each other and further combinations are possible. Most often in the literature the\nhelicity basis was chosen and the 16 possible polarization observables can be expressed\nin bilinear products\nOi (W, \u03b8 ) =\n\nq\nk\n\n4\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03b1k,` Hk (W, \u03b8 ) Hl\u2217 (W, \u03b8 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nk,`=1\n\nwhere O1 is the unpolarized differential cross section \u03c30 and all other observables are\nproducts of asymmetries with \u03c30 , for details see Table 1.\nFrom a complete set of 8 measurements {Oi (W, \u03b8 )} one can only determine the\nmoduli of the 4 amplitudes and 3 relative phases. However, there is always an unknown\noverall phase, e.g. \u03c61 (W, \u03b8 )}, which can not be determined by additional measurements.\nEven with the help of unitarity in form of Watson's theorem this angle-dependent\nphase cannot be provided. This has very strong consequences, namely a partial wave\ndecomposition would lead to wrong partial waves, which would be useless for nucleon\nresonance analysis.\n\nPartial wave analysis\nAs the main goal in the data analysis of photoproduction is the search for nucleon\nresonances and their properties, one can directly perform a partial wave analysis from the\nobservables without going through the underlying amplitudes. Such an analysis would\nbe a truncated partial wave analysis with a minimal model dependence (i) from the\ntruncation of the series at a maximal angular momentum `max and (ii) from an overall\nunknown phase as in the case of the amplitude analysis in the previous paragraph.\nHowever, in the PWA the overall phase would only be a function of energy and with\nadditional theoretical help it can be constrained without strong model assumptions. Such\na concept was already discussed and applied for \u03b3, \u03c0 in the 80s by Grushin [4] for a PWA\nin the region of the \u2206(1232) resonance. In a 2-step process first \u03b3, \u03c0 + was analyzed in a\ntruncation to S and P waves, where all higher partial waves were taken as Born terms,\ndominantly from the pion-pole contribution, which contributes only to charged pion\nproduction. This had the additional advantage that the overall phase was determined by\nthe real Born amplitudes for ` > 1. In order to separate the isospin 1/2 and 3/2 a further\nanalysis has to be done for \u03b3, \u03c0 0 . For neutral pion production, the higher partial waves\nare much smaller and can be neglected, however, in this case the overall phase remains\nundetermined. This problem could be solved by applying the Watson theorem just for\n\n\fTABLE 1. Spin observables expressed by helicity amplitudes in the notation of Walker [5]. The sign\ndefinition is taken from Barker, Donnachie and Storrow [6] by replacing N \u2192 H2 , S1 \u2192 H1 , S2 \u2192\nH4 , D \u2192 H3 . This sign definition is also used by SAID and MAID. The last column compares with\nFasano, Tabakin and Saghai (FTS) [1], which is the second most often used sign definition in the literature.\nIt has been adopted e.g. by recent work of Anisovich et al. [7] and Dey et al. [8], while in a paper by\nSandorfi et al. [9], a definition very close to FTS is used, however, with \u00ca changed into \u2212\u00ca. For the\npolarized observables the notation \u03a3\u0302 := \u03c30 \u03a3 etc. is used and a factor q/k is dropped in all observables.\nFurthermore, the parameters \u03b1i , \u03b2i , \u03b3i for the cos\u03b8 expansions in Eq.

For an S, P wave truncation (`max =\n1) there are 4 complex multipoles E0+ , E1+ , M1+ , M1\u2212 leading to 7 free real parameters\nand an arbitrary phase, which can be put to zero for the beginning. With the expansion\n\n\fparameters \u03b1i , \u03b2i from Table 1 one can already get 8 observable coefficients from the first\ngroup of 4 S -type observables. This already exceeds the number of free parameters,\nhowever, in order to resolve discrete ambiguities, one more observable or at least one\nmore coefficient needs to be measured. This can be taken from any type of double\npolarization BT , BR, T R. As has been shown by Omelaenko [11] the same is true for\nany PWA with truncation at `max . For the determination of the 8`max \u2212 1 free parameters\none has the possibility to measure (8`max , 8`max , 8`max + 4, 8`max + 4) coefficients for\ntypes (S , BT , BR, T R), respectively.\nHowever, this is only the mathematical issue of the problem. For any finite precision of\ndata, the solution of the problem becomes more involved and instead of exact solutions\nof the sets of quadratic equations one has to search for a minimum similar to a chisquare\nfit. Then the global minimum, which may already be difficult to find does not necessarily\ngive the correct solution. Therefore also local minima have to be considered and further\ntechniques are needed to arrive at the correct solution. On the experimental side one has\ntwo possibilities to improve the situation, either to get the observables at higher precision\nor to measure further observables than mathematically required.\nIn Ref. [9] in an analysis of kaon photoproduction with real world data such a problem\nwith multiple local minima has been faced and work is in progress. Similar problems will\nprobably occur also in eta photoproduction, however, in pion photoproduction it will\nbe different. There, the more difficult task to measure and analyze 2 charged channels,\np(\u03b3, \u03c0 0 )p and p(\u03b3, \u03c0 + )n also provides a chance to solve the problem with only a minimal\nmodel input. The big advantage in this reaction is the existence of the pion-pole term,\nwhich contributes only to charged pion channels and which gives large contributions\nfor higher partial waves. Since the pion-nucleon coupling constant is well known, these\nhigher partial waves can be very precisely calculated and furthermore their phases are\nknown, namely zero for real Born terms. This fixes the overall phase for \u03c0 + n partial\nwaves. In a subsequent analysis of \u03c0 0 photoproduction these higher Born terms do not\ncontribute, but as mentioned before, the overall phase can then be connected to the \u03c0 + n\nphase, Eq. (2). Of course this connection needs to be done only for one phase, which\nnaturally will be taken as the P33 phase, which is very well known and which is elastic\neven up to W \u2248 1550 MeV, whereas other phases as P11 become already inelastic for\nW \u2248 1300 MeV, close to the \u03c0\u03c0 threshold. This method was first applied in the analysis\nof Grushin [4].\nIn the presence of the t-channel pole contribution, the expansion of Eq. (3) must be\nmodified by\nOi (W, \u03b8 ) =\n\nq \u03b1i\nsin \u03b8\nk\n\n2`max +\u03b2i\n\n\u2211\nk=\u03b3i\n\naik (W ) (1 \u2212\n\nq\u03c0 +\ncos\u03b8 )k ,\n\u03c9\u03c0 +\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is an expansion around the pion pole. From the values of \u03b3i in Table 1 one\ncan see that most observables start with a single-pole structure \u223c 1/\u03ba with \u03ba = 1 \u2212\nq/\u03c9 cos\u03b8 , whereas the unpolarized cross section \u03c30 and the beam asymmetry \u03a3\u0302 as\nwell as all observables of BR type include an additional double-pole term \u223c 1/\u03ba 2 ,\nwhich is, however, completely fixed by the Born terms, hence by the \u03c0N coupling\nconstant. Therefore, only the coefficients ai\u22121 (W ) have to be obtained from the angular\ndistributions of the observables.\n\n\f1/2\n\nFIGURE 1.

Solid (open) circles display real (imaginary)\nsingle-energy fits including the final phase searching (SE6p) to the following 6 observables without any\nrecoil polarization measurement: d\u03c3 /d\u03a9, two single-spin observables \u03a3 and T and three beam-target\ndouble polarization observables E, F and G.\n\nPARTIAL WAVE ANALYSIS WITH PSEUDO-DATA\nIn a first numerical attempt towards a model-independent partial wave analysis, a procedure similar to the second method described above has been applied [12], and pseudodata, generated for \u03b3, \u03c0 0 and \u03b3, \u03c0 + have been analyzed.\nEvents were generated over an energy range from Elab = 200 \u2212 1200 MeV and a full\nangular range of \u03b8 = 0 \u2212 180\u25e6 for beam energy bins of \u2206E\u03b3 = 10 MeV and angular bins\nof \u2206\u03b8 = 10\u25e6 , based on the MAID2007 model predictions [13]. For each observable,\ntypically 5 * 106 events have been generated over the full energy range. For each energy\nbin a single-energy (SE) analysis has been performed using the SAID PWA tools [14] in\na 3-step process:\n1. An energy-dependent analysis (ED) was obtained from starting values given by the\ncurrent SAID SP09 ED solution.\n2. By fixing the phases of the multipoles to the ED solution, only the absolute values\nof the S, P, D and F multipoles (`max depends on the energy) were searched.\n3. In a final step also the phases of the multipoles were searched and a very satisfactory\nresult was found in comparison with the underlying MAID2007 solution.\nA series of fits have been performed [12] using 4, 6 and 8 observables. Here the example using 6 observables (\u03c30 , \u03a3, T, E, F, G) is demonstrated, where no recoil polarization\nhas been used. As explained before, such an experiment would be incomplete in the\nsense of an 'amplitude analysis', but complete for a truncated partial wave analysis. In\n1/2\n1/2\nFig. 1 two multipoles E0+ and M1\u2212 for the S11 and P11 channels are shown and the\nSE6p fits of the final step in the analysis are compared to the MAID2007 solution. The\nfitted SE solutions are very close to the MAID ED solution with very small uncertainties\nfor the S11 partial wave. For the P11 partial wave we obtain a larger statistical spread of\n\n\f1/2\n\nthe SE solutions. This is typical for the M1\u2212 multipole, which is generally much more\ndifficult to obtain with good accuracy [15, 13], because of the weaker sensitivity of the\nobservables to this magnetic multipole. But also this multipole can be considerably improved in an analysis with 8 observabes [12].\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIt is shown that for an analysis of N \u2217 resonances, the amplitude analysis of a complete\nexperiment is not very useful, because of an unknown energy and angle dependent\nphase that can not be determined by experiment and can not be provided by theory\nwithout a strong model dependence. However, the same measurements will be very\nuseful for a truncated partial wave analysis with minimal model dependence due to\ntruncations and extrapolations of Watson's theorem in the inelastic energy region. A\nfurther big advantage of such a PWA is a different counting of the necessary polarization\nobservables, resulting in very different sets of observables. While it is certainly helpful to\nhave polarization observables from 3 or 4 different types of Table 1, for a mathematical\nsolution of the bilinear equations one can find minimal sets of only 5 observables from\nonly 2 types, where either a polarized target or recoil polarization measurements can be\ncompletely avoided.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank R.
