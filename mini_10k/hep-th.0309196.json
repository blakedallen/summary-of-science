The wide number of hidden symmetries provides these\nsystems with unique properties, e.g., closed classical trajectories, the degenerated quantum-mechanical\nenergy spectrum, the separability of variables in a few coordinate systems. The overcomplete symmetry allows to preserve their exact solvability even after some deformation of the potential breaking\nthe initial symmetry, or, at least, to simplify the perturbative calculations. The reduction of these\nsystems to low dimensions allows one to construct new integrable systems with hidden symmetries\n[1].\nThere exist nontrivial generalizations of the oscillator and Coulomb systems on the sphere and the\ntwo-sheet hyperboloid (pseudosphere) [2] given by the potentials\nVCoulomb = \u2212\n\n\u03b3 xd+1\n,\nr0 |x|\n\nVosc =\n\n\u03c9 2 r02 x2\n.\n2 x2d+1\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere x, xd+1 are the (pseudo)Euclidean coordinates of the ambient space IRd+1 (IRd.1 ): \u01ebx2 +x2d+1 = r02 ,\nwith \u01eb = +1 for the sphere, \u01eb = \u22121 for the hyperboloid.\nThe potential of oscillator has also been generalized for the complex projective space CP\nI N , N > 1.\nThat is defined as follows [3]\nVosc = \u03c9 2 g \u0101b \u2202\u0101 K\u2202b K,\n(1.2)\nwhere K(z, z\u0304) = log(1 + z z\u0304) is K\u00e4hler potential of CP\nI N.\nThe generalized systems preserves the property of \"maximal superintegrability\" of the conventional\noscillator and Coulomb systems. They have 2d \u2212 1 functionally independent constants of motion (here\nD is the dimension of configuration space). The definition of the oscillator potential (1.2) tells us to\ndefine the Coulomb potential on CP\nI N as follows\n\u03b3\nVCoulomb = \u2212 p\n.\n\u0101b\ng \u2202\u0101 K\u2202b K\n\n(1.3)\n\nIn some cases one can establish the nontrivial relation between oscillator and Coulomb systems:\nthe (p + 1)\u2212dimensional Coulomb problem can be obtained from the 2p\u2212dimensional oscillator by the\n1\n\n\fso-called Levi-Civita (or Bohlin) (p = 1), Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (p = 2) and Hurwitz transformations\n(p = 4), when p = 1, 2, 4 [4], corresponding to the reduction by the actions of Z2 , U (1) and SU (2)\ngroups, respectively. To be more precise, these transformations connect the energy levels of oscillators\nwith the ones parametric families of Coulomb-like systems, specified by the presence of a magnetic flux\nfor p = 1 [5]; by a Dirac monopole for p = 2 (the MIC-Kepler system)[6]; and by a Yang monopole for\np = 4 [7](for the review, see [8]). Among these systems most elegant (and important) one is, probably,\nthe MIC-Kepler system, describing of the relative motion of two Dirac dyons. It is also relevant to\nthe the scattering of two well-separated BPS monopoles and dyons. The latter system was considered\nin a well-known paper by Gibbons and Manton [9], where the existence of a hidden Coulomb-like\nsymmetry was established. Nowdays the MIC-Kepler system is studied in details as well as Coulomb\none [10].\nTo relate the four-dimensional oscillator with the MIC-Kepler system, we have to perform its\nHamiltonian reduction by the action of U (1) group which leads the canonical symplectic structure on\nT \u2217C\nI 2 to the twisted symplectic structure on T \u2217 IR3 specified by the presence of monopole magnetic\nfield\nx \u00d7 dx \u00d7 dx\n\u03a9can = dz \u2227 d\u03c0 + dz\u0304 \u2227 d\u03c0\u0304 \u2192 \u03a9red = dx \u2227 dp + s\n.\n(1.4)\n|x|3\nHere s denotes the value of the generator of the Hamiltonian action\ns=\n\nJ0\n,\n2\n\nJ0 = i(z\u03c0 \u2212 z\u0304 \u03c0\u0304).\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe reduced coordinates are connected with the initial one as follows\nx = z\u03c3z\u0304,\n\np=\n\nz\u03c3\u03c0 + \u03c0\u0304\u03c3z\u0304\n,\n2z z\u0304\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 denote Pauli matrices.\nUpon this reduction, the energy surface of the four-dimensional oscillator yields the one of the MICKepler system. Applying this reduction to the oscillator on four-dimensional sphere/hyperboloid\nand on the complex projective space CP\nI 2 we shall get the MIC-Kepler system on three-dimensional\nhyperboloid [11, 3].\nThe appearing, in the reduced system, of the monopole field is due to Hamiltonian reduction: that\ncorresponds to the compactification of the spatial degree of freedom in the circle, which generate the\nmagnetic charge. So, the above reduction could be used for the construction of the three-dimensional\nsystems with monopole from the four-dimensional systems without it. Vice versa, on can try to\nconstruct the superintegrable four-dimensional system (without monopole) by the lifting the given\nthree-dimensional superintegrable one.\nIn present paper we analyze the following question: wether exist the maximally superintegrable\nsystems on four-dimensional U (2)\u2212invariant K\u00e4hler spaces, whose reductions yield the (superintegrable) three-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems with monopoles, including the systems on\nthe configurational spaces with non-constant curvature.\nFor this purpose we reduce the Hamiltonian system on the four-dimensional space equipped with\nU (2)\u2212 invariant K\u00e4hler metric to the system on three-dimensional conformal-flat space (Section 2).\nWe find that the the oscillator and Coulomb systems on the three-dimensional space, sphere and\nhyperboloid are originated on the four-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems on some K\u00e4hler\nspaces with conic singularity, so that (1.2), (1.3) give us the well-defined generalizations of the oscillator\nand Coulomb potentials on K\u00e4hler spaces. However, in the presence of Dirac monopole field arose\ndue to Hamiltonian reduction, the trajectories of the three-dimensional systems becomes unclosed.\nHence, in general, these systems are not superintegrable ones. On the other hand, one can define the\n\"maximally superintegrable\" generalization of the three-dimensional oscillator a with Dirac monopoles,\nwhich is originated in the four-dimensional system with non-K\u00e4hler metrics (Section 3). We also find\nthe family of superintegrable four-dimensional oscillators, which yield the \"maximally superintegrable\"\noscillator with monopoles, on the three-dimensional spaces with non-constant curvature (Section 4).\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\n3d systems with monopoles from of U (2)\u2212invariant K\u00e4hler\nspaces\n\nAs we mentioned in the Introduction, the Hamiltonian reduction, by the action of U (1) group, of\nthe eight-dimensional canonical symplectic structure yields the six-dimensional canonical symplectic\nstructure twisted by the magnetic field of the Dirac monopole (1.4). Particular consequence of this\nreduction is the reduction of the energy surface of the oscillator (on C\nI 2 , S 4 , CP\nI 2 ) to the energy surface\n3\nof the MIC-Kepler system (on IR and AdS3 ).\nIn this Section we would like to reveal which sort of system arise upon U (1) Hamiltonian reduction of the four-dimensional mechanical systems on the spaces with U (2)\u2212invariant K\u00e4hler metrics.\nParticulary, we hope do find, in this way, the four-dimensional origins of the three dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems on Euclidean spaces, spheres and hyperboloids (which are superintegrable\nsystems).\nThe K\u00e4hler potential of the U (2)-invariant K\u00e4hler spaces M , dim CI M0 = 2 is (in the appropriate\nlocal coordinates z a , a = 1, 2) of the form K(z z\u0304). Hence, the corresponding metric reads\ngab\u0304 =\n\n\u2202 2 K(z z\u0304)\n\u2202z a \u2202 z\u0304 b\n\n= a\u03b4ab\u0304 + a\u2032 z\u0304 a z b ,\n\nwhere a = dK \u2032 (y)/dy,\n\na\u2032 = a\u2032 (y).\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe particular cases of these spaces are the Euclidean space C\nI 2 (when K = z z\u0304) and the complex\n2\nprojective space CP\nI\n(when K = log(1 + z z\u0304)).\nThe motion of particle on M in the U (2)-invariant potential field V is described by the following\nHamiltonian system\n\u03a9can = dz a \u2227 d\u03c0a + dz\u0304 a \u2227 d\u03c0\u0304a ,\n\nH = g ab\u0304 \u03c0a \u03c0\u0304b + V (z z\u0304).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe Nether constants of motion corresponding to U (2) symmetry are given by the generators\nJ = iz\u03c3\u03c0 \u2212 i\u03c0\u0304\u03c3z\u0304,\n\n{J0 , Jk } = 0,\n\nJ0 = iz\u03c0 \u2212 iz\u0304\u03c0\u0304 :\n\n{Jk , Jl } = 2\u01ebklm Jm ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 denotes standard Pauli matrices.\nIn order to perform the Hamiltonian reduction of this system by the action of the generator J0 ,\nwe have to fix its level surface,\nJ0 = 2s,\n(2.4)\nand then factorize the level surface of by the action of vector field {J0 , }. The resulting six-dimensional\nphase space T \u2217 M red could be parameterized by the following U (1)-invariant functions:\ny = z\u03c3z\u0304,\n\n\u03c0=\n\nz\u03c3\u03c0 + \u03c0\u0304\u03c3z\u0304\n:\n2z z\u0304\n\n{y, J0 } = {\u03c0, J0 } = 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nIn these coordinates the reduced symplectic structure and the generators of the angular momentum\nare given by the expressions\n\u03a9red = d\u03c0 \u2227 dy + s\n\ny \u00d7 dy \u00d7 dy\n,\n|y|3\n\nJred = J/2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 y + s\n\ny\n.\n|y|\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe reduced Hamiltonian is given by the expression\nHred =\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n1 \u2212 by\ny\u03c0 \u2212 b(y\u03c0)2 + s2\n+ V (y),\na\nay\n\nwhere\n\ny \u2261 |y|,\n\nb=\n\na\u2032 (y)\n.\na + ya\u2032 (y)\n\n(2.7)\n\nHence, the reduced system is specified by the presence of a Dirac monopole.\nLet us perform the canonical transformation (y, \u03c0) \u2192 (x, p) to the coordinates, where the metric\ntakes a conformal-flat form:\n3\n\n\fx = f (y)y,\nwhere\n\n\u03c0 = fp +\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\nya\u2032 (y)\nyf \u2032 (y)\n=1+\n1+\nf\na\n\n\u21d2\n\ndf (yp)\ny,\ndy y\n\n\u0012\n\nd log x\ndy\n\n\u00132\n\n(2.8)\n\n=\n\nd log ya(y)\n.\nydy\n\n(2.9)\n\nNotice, that x < 1.\nIn the new coordinates the Hamiltonian takes the form\nHred =\n\nx2 (y) 2\ns2\np +\n+ V (y(x)) .\nya(y)\ny(a + ya\u2032 (y))\n\n(2.10)\n\nIn order to express the y, a(y), a\u2032 (y) via x it is convenient to introduce the function\nZ\n\u00c3(y) \u2261 (a + ya\u2032 (y))yf (y)dy\n\n(2.11)\n\nand consider its Legendre transform A(x),\nA(x) = xa(y)y \u2212 \u00c3(y)\n\n(2.12)\n\nThen, we get immediately\ndA(x)\n= a(y)y,\ndx\n\nx\n\np\nd2 A\n= y a(a + ya\u2032 (y)).\n2\ndx\n\n(2.13)\n\nBy the use of these expressions, we can present the reduced Hamiltonian system as follows\nHred =\n\ns2\nx2 2\np +\n2 + V (y(x)) ,\n2\nN\n(2xN \u2032 (x))\n\n\u03a9red = dp \u2227 dx + s\n\nx \u00d7 dx \u00d7 dx\n,\n|x|3\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere\n\ndA\n.\ndx\nThe K\u00e4hler potential of the initial system is connected with N via the equations\nN 2 (x) \u2261\n\nN 3 (x)\ndK\n= 2 \u2032\n,\ndx\n2x N (x)\n\nd log y\nN\n= 2 \u2032\n.\ndx\n2x N (x)\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\nLet us postulate, that the \"oscillator potential\" on the spaces under consideration by the same\nformula, as on the complex projective spaces, (1.2).

Hence, the oscillator/Coulomb system on the conifold (3.3), reduces, for J0 = 0, to the oscillator/Coulomb system on three-dimensional sphere/hyperboloid. Hence,\nthe initial four-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems are superintegrable ones, when the constant of motion J0 takes the value J0 = 0.\nWhen J0 6= 0, the relation between three- and four- dimensional systems is more complicated, and\nneeds separate consideration of the oscillator and Coulomb cases.\nLet us consider, at first, the case of oscillator. For a checking the superintegrability, let us clarify,\nwether trajectories of the reduced system are closed.\nSubstituting (3.1) and (3.5) in (2.22), we get\nZ\n\u03c6\ndu\np\n(3.6)\n| |=\n2\n2\n2\nJ\n\u22124r0 (\u03c9 r0 + 2E) + (8r02 E + l2 )u \u2212 (s2 + l2 )u2\n\nwhere\n\nl2 = 4(J 2 \u2212 s2 ),\n\n4u = (x + 1/x)2 .\n\n(3.7)\n\nFrom this expression we easily get\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2r2 E + J 2 \u2212 s2\n1\n=8 0 2\nx+\nx\n4J \u2212 3s2\n\n1+\n\ns\n\n!\nr\n(2r02 E + r04 \u03c9 2 )(4J 2 \u2212 3s2 )\n3s2\nsin 2 1 \u2212 2 |\u03c6|\n1\u22124\n(2r02 E + J 2 \u2212 s2 )2\n4J\n\nHence, trajectories are closed only when\nr\n3s2\n1\u2212 2\n4J\n\nis\n\nrational number.\n6\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fParticulary, trajectories are closed in in the \"ground state\", i.e. for s = J. In this case they belong\nto \"equatorial plane\", x3 = x. Hence, the Hamiltonian system (2.14) on sphere/hyperboloid with the\noscillator potential is not superintegrable for the arbitrary value of monopole number s.\nHowever, one can get the monopole generalization of oscillator whose trajectories are closed for\nany s, choosing the potential\n3s2\ns\n.\n(3.9)\nVosc\n= Vosc + 2\n4x (dN/dx)2\nIn that case the trajectories are given by the expression\ns\n!\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2 r2\n2r02 E + J 2 \u2212 s2\n1\n2E\n+\n\u03c9\n0\n1 + 1 \u2212 16J 2 r02\n=2\nsin 2|\u03c6| ,\nx+\nx\n2J 2\n(2r02 E + J 2 \u2212 s2 )2\n\n(3.10)\n\ni.e. they are closed for any s.\nHence, the superintegrable generalization of the Higgs oscillator specified by the presence of Dirac\nmonopole is defined by the Hamiltonian\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 + \u01ebx2 )2\ns2\ns2\n2x2\n\u01eb\n2 2\n2\nHMIC\u2212osc\n=\n+\n(\u03c9\nr\n+\np\n+\n)\n,\n\u01eb = \u00b11,\n(3.11)\n0\n8r02\nx2\n4r02 (1 \u2212 \u01ebx2 )2\nwhere \u01eb = 1 corresponds to the sphere and \u01eb = \u22121 to the hyperboloid.\nIt is originated in the Hamiltonian given by the expression\nH = g \u0101b \u03c0\u0304a \u03c0b +\n\n3J02\n+ \u03c9 2 Ka g ab\u0304 Kb\u0304 ,\n16R(z z\u0304)\n\nR=\n\n32r02 (z z\u0304)4\n.\n(1 + 4\u01eb(z z\u0304)4 )2\n\n(3.12)\n\nThere is an important difference of the above reduced oscillator from the one on the IR3 .\nNamely, the four-dimensional system with \"frequency\" \u03c9 yields the three-dimensional oscillator\nwith \"frequency\" dependent on the \"monopole number\" s\ns\ns2\n\u03c9s = \u03c9 2 + 4 ,\n4r0\nwhile the frequency of the oscillator reduced to IR3 is independent on s.\nNow, let us consider the system with Coulomb potential (1.3) on the conifold with K\u00e4hler structure\n(3.3). After Hamiltonian reduction it yields the three-dimensional system with Hamiltonian (3.2)\nwhere V = VCoulomb (3.5).\nOn the level surface s = 0 (i.e. in the absence of Dirac monopole), the reduced system coincides\nwith the standard Coulomb system on the sphere/hyperboloid. Therefore it is superintegrable one.\nOn the level surface s 6= 0 (i.e. in the presence of monopole) the potential of the reduced system is\nthe superposition of the Coulomb potential and of the oscillator one, proportional to s2 /r04 ! So, it is\nnot surprising, that the expression for trajectories of the reduced system, \u03c6 = \u03c6(r) is given by elliptic\nintegral...\nOn the other hand, there are the superintegrable MIC-Kepler systems on the sphere and hyperboloid, given by the Hamiltonian\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 + \u01ebx2 )2\n\u03b3 1 \u2212 \u01ebx2\ns2\n\u01eb\n2\nHMIC =\np + 2 \u2212\n, \u01eb = \u00b11,\n(3.13)\n2\n8r0\nx\nr0 2x\nwhere \u01eb = 1 corresponds to the sphere [12] and \u01eb = \u22121 to the hyperboloid [11].\nTo recover this system, we can try to modify the initial Coulomb system, transiting to the nonK\u00e4hler metric, as in the case of oscillator (compare with (3.12)),\nH = g \u0101b \u03c0\u0304a \u03c0b +\n\n\u03b3\n3J02\n+q\n,\n16R(z z\u0304)\nKa g ab\u0304 Kb\u0304\n7\n\nR=\n\n32r02 (z z\u0304)4\n.\n(1 + \u01eb(z z\u0304)4 )2\n\n(3.14)\n\n\fHowever, in that case the reduced Hamiltonian is given by the one of MIC-Kepler system (3.11) with\nadditional oscillator potential. So even modified Coulomb system is not exactly solvable for any value\nof J0 .\nWe have found the four-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems on appropriate K\u00e4hler conifolds, which result, after Hamiltonian reduction, in the oscillator and Coulomb systems on threedimensional sphere and two-sheet hyperboloid. The appearance, in the reduced system, of the Dirac\nmonopole, breaks the superintegrability of the system. However, the superintegrability of the oscillator system, in opposite to the Coulomb one, could be restored by the transition to the non-K\u00e4hler\nmetric.\n\n4\n\nFamily of oscillator systems\n\nThe results of previous Section could be easily extended to the K\u00e4hler space whose metric is defined\nby the potential\n\u01ebr2\nK = 0 log(1 + 4\u01eb(z z\u0304)n ), \u01eb = \u00b11, n > 0.\n(4.1)\n2\nFor n = 1 the potential (4.1) defines the Fubini-Studi metric of the two-dimensional complex projective space CP\nI 2 (for \u01eb = 1) and its noncompact version, the four-dimensional Lobacewski space L2 (for\n\u01eb = \u22121). These spaces are of the constant curvature ones, and have the the isometry group SU (3) for\n\u01eb = 1 and SU (1.2) for \u01eb = \u22121.\nThe case n = 4 was considered in previous Section. The system on such spaces results, after Hamiltonian reduction, in the ones on sphere(\u01eb = 1) or two-sheet hyperboloid \u01eb = \u22121 (which have the\nconstant curvature, and the isometry group SO(4) and SO(1.3) respectively).

From the previous\nstudy [3] it was known, that such a \"oscillator\" potential defines the well-defined superintegrable\nsystem on CP\nI n , and is distinguished with respect to supersymmetrization as well. Since the Hamiltonian reduction by the action of U (1) group generates, in the resulting three-dimensional system,\nthe magnetic field of Dirac monopole. We hoped to find, in this way, the superintegrable generalizations of oscillator and Coulomb systems on curved spaces, specified by the presence of Dirac\nmonopole. Particularly, we found the four-dimensional K\u00e4hler spaces (with conic sigularities) where\nthe three-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems on the IR3 , S 3 , IHI3 are originated, and established, that the original oscillator and Coulomb potential are, indeed, given by (1.2) and (1.3).\nHowever, when these, four-dimensional systems results in the three-dimensional ones specified by the\npresence of Dirac monopoles, their trajectories become unclosed. In other words, the monopole field\nbreaks superintegrability of the system. On the other hand, in the case of oscillator, transiting from\nthe K\u00e4hler metric to the appropriate non-K\u00e4hler one, we can restore superintegrability of systems\n(both initial and reduced one), but we can't do the same for the Coulomb system. We also extended these consideration for the some parametric family of K\u00e4her spaces including previous ones\nas a particular case. We found that the unique representative of this family, where the oscillator\nis superintegrable, is the complex projective space CP\nI 2 (and its non-compact version, Lobachewski\nspace L2 = SU (2.1)/SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). The energy surface of the oscillator on this four-dimensional\nspace leads to the energy surface of the MIC-Kepler system on three-dimensional hyperboloid. Let\nus notice, that while previous superintegrable generalizations of oscillator systems were formulated\non constant curvature spaces, the superintegrable oscillators constructed in the present paper, could\nhave configuration spaces with nonconstant curvature and conic singularities.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dmitry Fursaev for the useful conversations, and Levon Mardoyan for the interest in work.\nThe work of A.N is partially supported by grants INTAS 00-00262 and ANSEF PS81.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
