Here we report highly unusual and unexpected behaviors of\nthese carriers in applied external periodic potentials, i.e., in graphene superlattices. The group\nvelocity renormalizes highly anisotropically even\nto a degree that it is not changed at all for\nstates with wavevector in one direction but is reduced to zero in another, implying the possibility that one can make nanoscale electronic circuits out of graphene not by cutting it7,8,9,10 but\nby drawing on it in a non-destructive way.

These results address the fundamental question of how\nchiral massless Dirac fermions propagate in periodic potentials and point to a new possible path\nfor nanoscale electronics.\nSince the pioneering work by Esaki and Tsu11 , superlattices have been studied extensively and have had a\nhuge impact on semiconductor physics12,13 . Superlattices\ndemonstrate interesting phenomena such as negative differential conductivity, Bloch oscillations, gap openings\nat the mini Brillouin zone boundary formed by the additional periodic potential, etc12,13 . Conventional semiconducting superlattices are mainly produced by molecularbeam epitaxy and metallo-organic chemical vapour-phase\ndeposition while metallic superlattices are made by sputtering procedures12,13 . We expect that, by modulating the potential seen by the electrons, graphene superlattices may be fabricated by adsorbing adatoms on\ngraphene surface through similar techniques, by positioning and aligning impurities with scanning tunneling microscopy14,15,16 , or by applying a local top-gate voltage\nto graphene17,18,19 . Epitaxial growth of graphene5 on\ntop of pre-patterned substrate is also a possible route to\ngraphene superlattice. Recently, periodic pattern in the\nscanning tunneling microscope image has been demonstrated on a graphene monolayer on top of a metallic\nsubstrate20,21,22 as well.\nThe low energy charge carriers in pristine graphene are\ndescribed by a massless Dirac equation and have a linear\nenergy dispersion which is isotropic near the Dirac points\nK and K' in the Brillouin zone1,3,4,23,24,25 (Fig. 1a). It is\nshown experimentally that the carriers have a group ve-\n\nlocity of v0 \u2248 106 m/s which plays the role of an effective\nspeed of light in (2+1) dimensional quantum electrodynamics3,4 . Within the effective-Hamiltonian approximation,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n\u2212ikx \u2212 ky\n,\nH = ~v0\nikx \u2212 ky\n0\nwhere kx and ky are the x and y components of the\nwavevector k of the Bloch state defined with respect\nto the Dirac point, the wavefunction of the quasiparticles in graphene has two components corresponding to\nthe amplitude on the two different trigonal sublattices of\ngraphene and can be represented by a two component\nspinor23,24,25 . This spinor structure of the wavefunction\nis called a pseudospin (because it is not related to a real\nspin) or chirality23,24,25,26,27 , which is of central importance to the novel physical properties of graphene superlattices discussed below.\nLet us now consider the situation that an additional\nperiodic potential is applied to graphene. If the spatial\nperiod of the superlattice potential is much larger than\nthe nearest neighbor carbon-carbon distance in graphene\n(\u223c 1.42 \u00c5), the scattering of a state close to one Dirac\npoint to another one does not occur23,24,26 . Therefore,\neven though there are two nonequivalent Dirac cones for\nthe energy dispersion surface of graphene, focusing on a\nsingle cone is sufficient. This condition also implies that,\nin the graphene superlattices discussed here, there is no\ngap opening at the Dirac point23,24,26 .\nTo investigate the physics of charge carriers in\ngraphene superlattices, we have calculated the energy dispersions, the group velocities, and energy gap\nopenings at the minizone boundaries (MB) within the\neffective-Hamiltonian formalism1 . Effects of the external\nperiodic potential are incorporated into our calculation\nthrough the scattering matrix elements between pseudospin states, or chiral eigenstates, of the electrons in\ngraphene:\nX1\n\u0001\nhs, k |U (r)| s\u2032 , k\u2032 i =\n1 + ss\u2032 e\u2212i\u03b8k,k\u2212G U (G) \u03b4k\u2032 ,k\u2212G .\n2\nG\n\nHere, G's are reciprocal lattice vectors of the superlattice\nand \u03b8k,k\u2212G is the angle between k and k \u2212 G.

For example, in a 1D superlattice of KronigPenny type of periodic potential with potential barrier\nheight (U1D ) of 0.5 eV and spatial period (L) and barrier\nwidth (w) of 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively, the group\nvelocity of the charge carriers when k is along certain\ndirection is renormalized to be slower than 40 % of its\noriginal value v0 but is the same as v0 along some other\ndirection. [Fig. 2a: the plotted quantity vk\u0302 \u2261 v(k) * k\u0302\nis the component of the group velocity parallel to the\nwavevector k in units of v0 . We note that this quantity\nwhich depends only on the direction of k (Supplementary\nDiscussion 2) is exactly equal to the absolute value of the\ngroup velocity vg when k is at 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees\n\n\f3\nU1D = 0.3 eV\nL = 10 nm\nw = 5 nm\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\u2206E\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n\u03c0/L\n\n\u2212\u03c0/L\n\n0\n\u22120.06 \u22120.03\n\nb\n\u2206E (eV)\n\na\nE (eV)\n\nfrom the periodic direction of the applied potential and,\nwhen the applied potential is weak, is only slightly different from vg at other angles (Supplementary Discussion\n3).] Thus, the group velocity of charge carriers can be\ntailored highly anisotropically in graphene superlattices.\nMore interestingly, the group velocity when k is along\nthe direction perpendicular to the periodic direction of\nthe potential (v\u22a5 ) is reduced the most, whereas when k\nis in the parallel direction, it is not renormalized at all\n(Fig. 1b). This result is counter-intuitive since the velocity is strongly reduced when the charge carrier is moving\nparallel to the hurdles, but is not modulated when it is\ncrossing them.\nTo understand the physics behind this phenomenon,\nwe have performed the same calculation for a fictitious\nsystem with carriers that have no chirality but otherwise identical to those in graphene including the linear\nenergy dispersion. The group velocity in this system is\nreduced isotropically and the renormalized group velocity is close to v\u22a5 , i.e., the maximally renormalized one,\nin 1D graphene superlattices (Fig. 2a). Thus, it is clear\nthat the absence of velocity renormalization in the direction parallel to the periodicity of the external potential\noriginates from the chiral nature of the electronic states\nof graphene. This behavior can be demonstrated more\nclearly by second order perturbation theory in the case\nof the 1D periodic potential with weak amplitudes (Supplementary Discussion 2). We note that the chirality discussed here is also important in tunneling phenomenon\nin graphene through a single barrier27 or a finite number\nof barriers28.\nIn the case of two-dimensional (2D) graphene superlattices, the group velocity is renormalized for k states\nalong every direction, but anisotropically (Fig. 1c). As\nthe amplitude of the potential increases the overall group\nvelocity is reduced and the ratio of the maximum group\nvelocity to the minimum one is enhanced (Fig. 2b). Here,\nagain, the anisotropy disappears if the chiral nature of\nthe states in graphene is arbitrarily removed. As was\ndemonstrated for the 1D superlattice, the sinusoidal dependence on the angle of propagation as well as the overall shift in the case of 2D graphene superlattice of the\ncomponent of the renormalized group velocity parallel to\nk in the weak potential limit is well explained and reproduced by second order perturbation theory (Supplementary Discussion 2).\nRemarkably, the anisotropy in energy dispersions of\nthe 1D superlattices can be tuned by changing the applied potential in such a way that v\u22a5 is reduced completely to zero (Fig. 2c). Hence, we can achieve extremely low mobility in one direction and normal conduction in another one simultaneously. This enables one\nto control the flow of electrons dramatically. It also provides a novel non-destructive pathway to make graphene\nnanoribbons7,8,9,10 which have been actively pursued by\nway of cutting graphene sheets9,10 . The chiral nature\nof the states in graphene also plays a decisive role here.\nIn the model without chirality as discussed before the\n\n0\n\n0.03 0.06\nkx (\u00c5\u22121)\n\nL = 10 nm\nw = 5 nm\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\nky (\u00c5\n\n0.1\n\u22121\n\n)\n\nFIG. 3: Energy gap at the superlattice Brillouin zone\nor minizone boundary of a 1D graphene superlattice.\na, Energy of charge carriers in 1D graphene superlattice versus the component of the wavevector k parallel to the periodic\npotential direction (kx ) at a fixed ky .

Red, green and blue\nlines correspond to U1D being 0.1 eV, 0.3 eV and 0.5 eV,\nrespectively.\n\n(isotropic) group velocity of charge carriers is reduced\nmonotonically and never reaches zero within a conceivable range of the potential amplitude (Fig. 2c). We can\nalso achieve vanishing group velocity in one direction by\nchanging the length parameters of the superlattice (Fig.\n2d).\nGraphene superlattices show peculiar behavior of gap\nopenings at the MB formed by the external periodic potential (Fig. 3). In conventional layer-structured 1D superlattices, gap opening at the MBs is considered to be\nnearly constant, independent of k. 1D graphene superlattices, however, are different in that the gap (\u2206E) vanishes when k is along the direction of the periodic potential, i.e., at the centre of the MB (Fig. 3a and 4a).\nMoreover, the size of the gap depends strongly on where\nit is on the MB (Fig. 3b). These strong anisotropies in the\ngap opening do not happen in superlattices made from a\nsystem having linear energy dispersions but no chirality\n(Fig. 3b). Hence, again, the chiral nature of charge carriers in graphene is key in generating these anisotropies\nin the gap opening as it does in the velocity renormalization. In particular, the gap closure at the centre of the\nMB is directly related to the absence of back-scattering\nof charge carriers from a scattering potential when the\nsize of the scatterer is several times larger than the intercarbon distance23,24,26 . In 1D graphene superlattices, the\nimportant length-scale is L, which is much larger than the\ninter-carbon distance, and hence the gap does not open\nat the centre of the MB.\nThe largest gap at the MB in a graphene superlattice\nis proportional to the amplitude of the applied potential\nif the potential is weak (i.e., small compared to the band\nwidth) and the size of which thus can be made to be a few\n\n\f4\nb\n\nE (eV)\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0 \u22120.02\n\n0\n\nkx (\u00c5\u22121) 0.02\n\n0.03\n\u22120.03 0 k (\u00c5\u22121)\ny\n\nDOS (1012eV\u22121cm\u22122)\n\n1D graphene superlattice\n\n90\n60\n30\n0\n\u22120.2 \u22120.1\n\nc\n\nd\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEF (eV)\n\n\u22122\n\n2D graphene superlattice\nE (eV)\n\nDOS (10 eV cm )\n\na\n\n90\n\n\u22121\n\n0.3\n\n12\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.0\u22120.02\n\nkx (\u00c5\u22121)\n\n0 0.02\n\n\u22120.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\nky (\u00c5\u22121)\n\n60\n30\n0\n\u22120.2 \u22120.1\n\nEF (eV)\n\nFIG. 4: Energy dispersions and densities of states of\ncharge carriers in graphene superlattices. a, Energy\nof charge carriers in 1D graphene superlattice with U1D =\n0.3 eV, L = 10 nm and w = 5 nm in the first (red and black)\nand the second (blue and pink) band above the vertex of the\nDirac cone versus 2D wavevector k away from the Dirac point.\nMinizone boundaries are at kx = \u00b10.031 \u00c5\u22121 .

We have also investigated the\ngap opening in 1D graphene superlattices with different\nvalues of length parameters (L and w). We find that, by\nchanging these parameters, the anisotropy in the gap at\nthe MB can also be controlled (Supplementary Discussion 5).\nDue to the velocity renormalization near the Dirac\npoint and the strong anisotropy in energy dispersion close\nto the MB, the type and the density of states (DOS) of\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWallace, P.

USA. 102, 10451\u201310453 (2005).\n\ncharge carriers vary drastically from those in graphene as\none varies the Fermi energy (Fig. 4). As the Fermi level\nchanges, the topology of the Fermi surface also exhibits\na dramatic variation (Supplementary Discussion 6). For\nexample, as the Fermi level increases from the energy at\nthe Dirac point, the charge carriers of a 1D graphene superlattice fill electron orbits and show a linear increase\nin the DOS with slope larger than that of graphene;\nbut above certain value, the DOS of electron orbits vanishes and charge carriers suddenly fill open orbits and\nhole pockets. When the Fermi level increases further,\ncharge carriers are in purely open orbits and then the\nDOS of electron orbits starts to reappear and increases\nagain (Fig. 4b). We expect that the Fermi level in a\ngraphene superlattice can be tuned as in graphene by\napplying a gate voltage3,4,18,19 . Hence, by exploiting the\nvarious characteristics of charge carriers and the Fermi\nsurface topology, one can manipulate a variety of physical properties dominated by the Fermi surface, such as\nconductance or magnetoresistance, significantly.\nThe anisotropic gap opening at the MB and the dramatic variation of the characters of charge carriers with\nthe Fermi energy are also common in 2D graphene superlattices. The gap at the centres of the zone boundaries\ncloses as in 1D graphene superlattice (Fig. 4c). However,\nthe gap at the corners of the 2D MB also disappears.\nThis behavior, which occurs in rectangular 2D graphene\nsuperlattices in general, has again its origin in the chiral nature of charge carriers in graphene (Supplementary Discussion 4). In a square 2D graphene superlattice,\ncharge carriers are electrons, holes or a mixture of the two\ndepending on the Fermi level (Fig. 4d). For general rectangular 2D graphene superlattices, charge carriers can\nalso be in open orbits.\nHere we have presented several novel physical properties of graphene superlattices with Kronig-Penney type\n1D and muffin-tin type 2D potentials. Through additional calculations, we have confirmed that all the salient\nfeatures of our findings are the same in sinusoidal or\nGaussian types of graphene superlattices in general as\nwell. The novel properties discovered in the present study\nthus should be of interest to the fundamental study and\npractical applications of graphene systems in general.\nFinally, since the massless Dirac fermions in graphene\nsuperlattices have some features in common with highenergy relativistic particles propagating in anisotropic\nspace like the anisotropy in the group velocity29 , interesting physics of the latter may also be investigated by\ntable-top experiments based on our theoretical findings.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nNovoselov, K.

The Brillouin zone of\ngraphene is a hexagon which has two inequivalent vertices, so-called the Dirac points, K and K\u2032 , that cannot\nbe connected by reciprocal lattice vectors. In this work,\nwe are considering eigenstates near K only as discussed\nin the paper. The effective Hamiltonian for low-energy\nquasiparticles of graphene in this basis is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n\u2212ikx \u2212 ky\n,\n(1)\nH0 (k) = ~v0\nikx \u2212 ky\n0\nwhere v0 is the Fermi velocity and k the small wavevector\nof the quasiparticle from the K point in the Brillouin zone\nof graphene. The energy spectrum of this Hamiltonian is\nE = s~v0 k where s is +1 or \u22121 for an eigenstate above or\nbelow the Dirac point energy which is defined to be the\n\n(E \u2212 \u03b5s,k ) c(s, k) =\n\nenergy zero, respectively. Eigenstates of this Hamiltonian\nis given by\n1\nhr|s, ki = \u221a ei(K+k)*r\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nisei\u03b8k\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8k is the angle of vector k with respect to the k\u0302x\ndirection. Now, when an additional periodic potential\nU (r) is applied to graphene, the scattering amplitude\nbetween states are given by\nhs, k |U (r)| s\u2032 , k\u2032 i =\n\nX1\nG\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n1 + ss\u2032 e\u2212i\u03b8k,k\u2212G U (G) \u03b4k\u2032 ,k\u2212G ,\n\n(3)\nwhere G and U (G) are the reciprocal lattice vector and\nthe corresponding Fourier component of the external periodic potential, respectively, and \u03b8k,k\u2212G the angle from\nk \u2212 G to k. The energy dispersions and eigenstates of\nthe quasiparticles in a graphene superlattice are obtained\nnon-perturbatively within the single-particle picture by\nsolving the following set of linear equations:\n\nX1\n\u0001\n1 + ss\u2032 e\u2212i\u03b8k,k\u2212G U (G) c(s\u2032 , k \u2212 G) ,\n2\n\u2032\n\n(4)\n\ns ,G\n\nwhere E is the superlattice energy eigenvalue and \u03b5s,k =\ns~v0 k the energy of the quasiparticles before applying the\nperiodic potential. c(s, k) and c(s\u2032 , k \u2212 G) are the amplitudes of mixing among different unperturbed quasiparticle states.\n\nSupplementary Discussion 2 : Velocity\nrenormalization near the Dirac point from second\norder perturbation theory\n\nWhen the external potential is weak, perturbative calculations can give results in good agreement with the full\ncalculation and also in physically more intuitive forms.\nFor pristine graphene, the group velocity of states near\nthe Dirac point is parallel to k and of constant magnitude\n(v0 ). For a graphene superlattice, the renormalization in\nthe component of the group velocity of quasiparticles parallel to the wavevector k [vk\u0302 \u2261 v(k) * k\u0302] around the Dirac\npoint can be obtained within second order perturbation\napproximation as\nX 2|U (G)|2\nvk\u0302 \u2212 v0\n=\u2212\nsin2 \u03b8k,G ,\nv0\nv02 |G|2\n\n(5)\n\nG6=0\n\nwhere \u03b8k,G is the angle from G to k. From Eq. (5), it\nis clear that for weak potentials, the velocity renormal-\n\nization grows as square of the amplitude of the external potential and vk\u0302 depends only on the direction of k.\nThroughout this document, by weak potential we mean\nthat the condition,\n|U (G)|\n\u226a1,\nv0 |G|\n\n(6)\n\nis satisfied for all the U (G) components. In the absence\nof chirality of the states, the scattering matrix element\n[Eq. (3)] should be changed into\nX\nhs, k |U (r)| s\u2032 , k\u2032 i =\nU (G) \u03b4k\u2032 ,k\u2212G .\n(7)\nG\n\nUsing Eq. (7), the similar quantity as in Eq. (5) for\nnonchiral massless Dirac fermions is now given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX 2|U (G)|2\nvk\u0302 \u2212 v0\n,\n(8)\n=\u2212\nv0\nv02 |G|2\nnon\u2212chiral\nG6=0\n\nwhich is isotropic independent of the direction of k. Comparing Eq. (5) and Eq. (8), the renormalization of group\nvelocity in a one-dimensional (1D) superlattice for a fictitious graphene with states without chirality corresponds\nto the maximum renormalization in the corresponding\n1D graphene superlattice. This trend agrees with the results from the full calculation when the potential is weak\n(Fig. 2 of paper).\n\n\f7\n\n\u221a(v0 \u2212 v )/ v0\n\n1\nL = 10 nm\nw = 5 nm\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nwhere L is the spatial period of the potential, and U1D\nand w are the height and the width of the rectangular\npotential barrier, respectively.

Now the group velocity vk\u0302 is renormalized in every direction. Equation (11) reproduces the sinusoidal variation of the velocity renormalization as well\nas the constant shift as obtained in the full calculation\nquite well when the potential is weak (Fig. 2b of paper).\n\nSupplementary Discussion 3 : The magnitude and\nthe component parallel to the wavevector k of the\ngroup velocity\n\nThe component of the group velocity vk\u0302 parallel to\nthe wavevector k above is exactly equal to the absolute\n\n(11)\n\nvalue of the group velocity vg when k is at 0, 90, 180\nor 270 degrees from the periodic direction of the applied\npotential and, when the applied potential is weak, is only\nslightly different from vg at other angles (Supplementary\nFig. 2).\n\nSupplementary Discussion 4 : Band gap at the\nminizone boundary from degenerate perturbation\ntheory\n\nWhen the wavevector k is on the minizone boundary\n(MB) of the 1D graphene superlattice, kx = \u00b1\u03c0/L, two\nstates |s, ki and |s, k \u2212 (2\u03c0/L, 0)i are degenerate before\n\n\f8\n1\n\napplying the periodic potential.

The more interesting\ncase is the corner of the minizone, where the four\ndegenerate states |s, (\u03c0/Lx , \u03c0/Ly )i, |s, (\u2212\u03c0/Lx, \u03c0/Ly )i,\n|s, (\u03c0/Lx , \u2212\u03c0/Ly )i and |s, (\u2212\u03c0/Lx , \u2212\u03c0/Ly )i mix\nstrongly among themselves by the applied periodic\npotential. If we set up a similar matrix for this case like\nEq. (12) for the 1D graphene superlattice, the energy\neigenvalues of the matrix are\nE = \u03b5s,k \u00b1\n\nr\n\n2\n\n2\n\n[U (2\u03c0/Lx , 0) sin \u03b8k,x\u0302 ] \u2212 [U (0, 2\u03c0/Ly )cos \u03b8k,x\u0302 ] ,\n\n(15)\nwhere k = (\u03c0/Lx , \u03c0/Ly ) is at the minizone corner and\neach eigenvalue is doubly degenerate. The energy spectrum given by Eq. (15) clearly shows that there is no\ngap at the minizone corner between the first and the\nsecond band (Fig. 4c of paper). This gap closure at\nthe minizone corner is not obvious because a transition,\nwhich is not of a backscattering process, from one of the\nfour k points at the zone corners to another can occur in the 2D rectangular graphene superlattice. For\nexample, the state |s, (\u03c0/Lx , \u03c0/Ly )i can mix with another state |s, (\u2212\u03c0/Lx , \u03c0/Ly )i by the reciprocal lattice\nvector G = (2\u03c0/Lx , 0) but the two k vectors are not\nanti-parallel. To understand the origin of the gap closure\n\n\f9\nat the minizone corner, we repeated a similar calculation\nfor a 2D rectangular superlattice formed of a non-chiral\n\nsystem with linear energy dispersions. In this case, the\nenergy eigenvalues are\n\nEnon\u2212chiral = \u03b5s,k + U (2\u03c0/Lx, 2\u03c0/Ly ) \u00b1 [U (2\u03c0/Lx, 0) \u2212 U (0, 2\u03c0/Ly )] ,\n\u03b5s,k \u2212 U (2\u03c0/Lx, 2\u03c0/Ly ) \u00b1 [U (2\u03c0/Lx, 0) + U (0, 2\u03c0/Ly )] .\n\nSupplementary Discussion 5 : Dependence of the\nband gap at the minizone boundary on length\nparameters and broken particle-hole symmetry\n\nFor a Kronig-Penney type rectangular potential barrier 1D graphene superlattice, the energy gap at the MB\ncan be expressed with Eq. (13) in terms of superlattice\nparameters as\n\u2206E =\n\n\u0010 \u03c0w \u0011\n2\nsin \u03b8k,x\u0302 .\nU1D sin\n\u03c0\nL\n\n(17)\n\nThus, according to this simple degenerate perturbation\ntheory result if the spatial period (L) becomes long for\na constant barrier width (w) the gap should decrease,\nwhereas if L is fixed and w is increased from zero, the\ngap should reach a maximum at w = L/2 and after that\nshould decrease symmetrically. The former trend is observed in the full calculation (Supplementary Fig. 3a);\nhowever, the latter seems not to hold in the full calculation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Moreover, the gap\nopenings at the MB above and below the Dirac cone are\ndifferent (Supplementary Fig. 3), which shows the limitation of the simple degenerate perturbation theory because the potential is not so weak and possesses higher\nFourier components. One thing to note is that the energy\ndispersion for states above the energy of the Dirac point,\nincluding the gap opening, for a 1D Kronig-Penney type\nsuperlattice with width w = w0 is identical with that\nof states below the energy of the Dirac point for width\nw = L \u2212 w0 (Supplementary Fig. 3b, compare red and\nblue lines). This symmetry can be understood following a simple argument. If we start from a 1D KronigPenney superlattice with w = w0 and then change w to\nbe w = L \u2212 w0 and at the same time invert the whole\npotential, the resulting periodic potential is identical to\n\nthe original one other than a constant shift which may\nbe ignored. Inverting the potential is effectively the same\nas exchanging particles with holes.\n\na\n0.2\n\nU1D = 0.3 eV\nw = 5 nm\n\nb\n\nU1D = 0.3 eV\nL = 10 nm\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206E (eV)\n\nAccording to Eq. (16), there is a finite energy gap between the first and the second band in general, other than\nin accidentally symmetric cases. Therefore, the gap closure at the minizone corner of a 2D rectangular graphene\nsuperlattice is a direct consequence of the chiral nature\nof the states in graphene.\n\n(16)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\nky (\u00c5\n\n0.1\n\u22121\n\n)\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\nky (\u00c5\n\n0.1\n\u22121\n\n)\n\nFIG. 7: (Supplementary Figure 3) Dependence of the\nenergy gap at the minizone boundary on the length\nparameters of 1D graphene superlattice. a, The energy\ngap \u2206E between the first and the second band at the minizone\nboundary versus ky for charge carriers above (solid lines) and\nbelow (dashed lines) the energy at the Dirac point in a 1D\ngraphene superlattice.
