A local annihilation rate is\nproportional to the square of number density of DM particles. Therefore, annihilation proceeds more efficiently\nin the dense DM substructures of the Galactic halo. Both\nanalytical calculations [2, 3, 4, 5] and numerical simulations [6, 7, 8] with the inflationary-produced adiabatic\ndensity fluctuations predict the existence of DM clumps\nin the Galactic halo. The enhancement of the annihilation signal due to the presence of substructures in the\nGalactic halo depends on the fraction of the most dense\nsmall-scale clumps [4, 9]. The most essential characteristics of clumps for calculations of DM annihilation in the\nGalactic halo are the minimum mass and distribution\nfunction of clumps. At the same time the tidal destruction of clumps [4] strongly influences the number density\nof clumps in the Galaxy.\nThe small-scale clumps [2, 3, 4] are formed only if the\ncorresponding density fluctuations are large enough. The\ninflation models predict the power-law primordial fluctuation spectrum with an power index np \u2248 1.0. The smallscale clumps are formed earlier than the larger ones and\ncaptured by the larger clumps in the process of a hierarchical clustering in the expanding Universe. Eventually\nall clumps consist in part of the smaller ones and of the\nfree DM particles. An effective index of the density perturbation power spectrum n \u2192 \u22123 at small-scales (when\nmass inside the perturbation M \u2192 0). This means that\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: berezinsky@lngs.infn.it\naddress: dokuchaev@inr.npd.ac.ru\n\u2021 Electronic address: erosh@inr.npd.ac.ru\n\u2020 Electronic\n\na gravitational clustering of small-scale structures proceeds very fast. As a result the formation of new clumps\nand their capturing by the larger ones are nearly simultaneous processes.\nA convenient formalism, which describes statistically\nthis hierarchical clustering, is the Press-Schechter theory\n[10] and its extensions, in particular the 'excursion set'\nformalism developed by Bond et al. [11] (for a clear introduction see [12]). However, this theory does not include\nan important process of the tidal destruction of small\nclumps inside the bigger ones. This process has been\ntaken into account in our previous work [4], where it was\ndemonstrated that only a small fraction of the small-scale\nclumps survives the tidal destruction in the hierarchical\nclustering. Nevertheless, even this small fraction of survived small-scale clumps is enough to dominate the DM\nannihilation rate for the most reasonable spectra of primordial fluctuations.\nA mass distribution of small-scale clumps survived in\nthe hierarchical structuring was derived in [4]:\n\u03beint\n\ndM\ndM\n\u2243 0.01(n + 3)\n,\nM\nM\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M is a clump mass, n is a power-index of density\nperturbations at a mass-scale M . The distribution function \u03beint is a mass fraction of DM in the form of clumps\nin the logarithmic mass interval d log M .\nThe minimal mass of DM clumps Mmin is determined\nby the leakage of DM particles from the growing density fluctuations (the diffuse leakage and free streaming) and depends on the properties of DM particles\n[3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The existing estimates of\nMmin for neutralino DM are substantially different, from\nMmin \u223c 10\u221212 M\u2299 in [19] to Mmin \u223c (10\u22127 \u2212 10\u22126)M\u2299 in\n[15, 16, 17]. In [4] we performed detailed calculations of\na DM particle diffusion and free streaming in the kinetic\nequation approach. For the case of neutralino considered\n\n\f2\nas a pure bino we obtained for the minimal mass of DM\nclumps\nMmin\n\nm\u03c7 \u0011\u221215/8\n= 1.5 \u00d7 10\n100 GeV\n\u0010 g \u0011\u221215/16 \u0012 \u039b\u2217 \u00133\n\u2217\n\u00d7\nM\u2299 ,\n10\n83\n\u22128\n\n\u0010\n\nM\u0303\n1 TeV\n\n!\u22123/2\n(2)\n\nwhere M\u0303 2 = m\u03032 \u2212 m2\u03c7 , with m\u03c7 being a neutralino mass,\nm\u0303 is a sfermion mass, and \u039b\u2217 has only a logarithmic\ndependence on M\u0303 and m\u03c7 . In the considered range of\nparameters \u039b\u2217 \u2243 83. Our value of Mmin agrees reasonably well with [15, 16, 17] and strongly disagrees with\n[19] for the reasons explained in [4].\nDue to uncertainties in the SUSY parameters, a numerical value of Mmin is not exactly predicted. With our\nchoice of SUSY parameters [4], Mmin \u223c 10\u22128 M\u2299 , is of\nthe Moon-scale mass. With other choice of SUSY parameters [17], Mmin \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299 , is of the Earth-scale mass.\nIn the numerical simulations [20], Mmin \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299 , was\nactually assumed by putting the corresponding cut-off in\nthe initial density perturbations.\nThe very interesting numerical simulations of the formation of small-scale DM clumps with a mass larger than\nthe Earth mass have been performed recently in [20].\nThere is direct correspondence of this simulations with\nthe earlier theoretical calculations:\n(i) The density profile of large-scale clumps is influenced by the hierarchical clustering of the smaller ones.\nThe new important result of numerical simulations [20]\nis a resolution of the density profile of the isolated minimal mass clumps, Mmin \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299 . The clumps of\nminimal mass are formed directly from the isolated fluctuations and their density profile is not influenced by the\nhierarchical clustering. The internal density profile of\nsmall-scale clumps in these simulations is proved out the\nsame as in the theoretical calculations [21] performed for\nthe isolated density fluctuations. The agreement between\nthe theory and numerical simulations for the predicted\ninternal density profile of clumps, \u221d r\u2212\u03b2 , is fairly good\nwithin the involved uncertainties: \u03b2 = 1.7 \u2212 1.8 in [21],\nand \u03b2 = 1.5 \u2212 2.0 in [20] respectively.\n(ii) The numerical simulations [20] agree rather well\nwith the shape of theoretically derived mass function of\nsmall-scale clumps [4] but with the different normalizations.\nA tidal destruction in the Galaxy of the Earth-size\nclumps from simulations [20] has been recently considered in [22, 23, 24]. The results are rather controversial. Authors of [22, 23] conclude that all the Earth-mass\nclumps are destructed in tidal interactions with stars in\nthe Galaxy, while in [24] this result was not confirmed\nunder a different assumption on the star number density.\nIn this paper we present the alternative and independent calculations for all processes of the tidal destruction\nof small-scale clumps: (i) in the hierarchical clustering,\n(ii) by stars from the stellar bulge, (iii) by stars from the\n\nhalo and (iv) by the Galactic disc. The last of these processes is turned out the most effective. We also describe a\nnew method for calculations of clump destruction in the\nhierarchical clustering, which is a more general (valid for\nthe arbitrary spectra of primeval fluctuations) and formally more transparent than the earlier one in [4].\nOur calculations of the tidal destruction of clumps by\nstars in the Galaxy are quite different from [22, 23, 24] by\nboth, methods and results. While in the references above,\nonly the tidal destructions in collisions of clumps with the\nindividual stars were studied, we found that dominant\neffect is provided by the destruction of clumps in the\ncollective gravitational field of the Galactic disc. As a\nresult we predict that only 17% of the Earth-mass clumps\nsurvived the tidal destruction at the position of the Sun.\nThis result is crucial for the rate of DM annihilation in\nthe Galaxy.\nThe paper is organized as it follows: In the Sec. II we\ndescribe a new method for calculation of the small-scale\nclump destruction in the hierarchial clustering. We calculate a mass function of survived clumps and compare\nit with a corresponding one from numerical simulations.\nIn the Sec. III the tidal destruction of clumps by the\nGalactic disk is considered. In the Sec. IV the life-time\nof clumps in the central stellar bulge and stellar halo\nspheroid is calculated. In the Sec. V we discuss the obtained results.\nWe perform our calculations for the standard cosmological model with a matter density parameter \u03a9m = 0.3,\na cosmological constant term \u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m \u2243 0.7 and the\nHubble constant h = 0.7.\n\nII.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF CLUMPS IN\nHIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING\n\nThe process of hierarchical clustering and tidal destruction of DM clumps can be outlined in the following way. The DM clumps of minimal mass are formed\nfirst in the expanding Universe. The clumps of larger\nmass, which host the smaller ones are formed later, and\nso on. Some part of clumps are destroyed tidally in the\ngravitational field of their host clumps.\nIn this Section we study the destruction of DM clumps\nin the process of hierarchical structuring long before the\nfinal galaxy formation. At small-mass scales the hierarchial clustering is a fast and rather complicated nonlinear\nprocess. We use a simplified model which nevertheless\ntakes into account the most important features of hierarchial clustering.\nTo describe the formation of clumps we will use the\nmodel of spherical collapse [12] in flat cosmology without\nthe \u039b-term. This assumption is well justified at early\ntimes of clumps formation when the \u039b-term is negligible\nin comparison with the matter density. In this model a\nformation time of clump with an internal density \u03c1 is t =\n(\u03ba\u03c1eq /\u03c1)1/2 teq , where \u03ba = 18\u03c0 2 and \u03c1eq = \u03c10 (1 + zeq )3\nis a cosmological density at the time of matter-radiation\n\n\f3\nequality teq , 1 + zeq = 2.35 \u00d7 104 \u03a9m h2 and \u03c10 = 1.9 \u00d7\n10\u221229 \u03a9m h2 g cm\u22123 . The index 'eq' here and throughout\nbelow refers to quantities at the time of matter-radiation\nequality teq .\nThe DM clumps of mass M can be formed from density fluctuations of different peak-height \u03bd = \u03b4eq /\u03c3eq (M ),\nwhere \u03c3eq (M ) is the fluctuation dispersion on a massscale M at the time teq . A mean internal density of\nclump \u03c1 is fixed at the time of clump formation and\naccording to [12] equals \u03c1 = \u03ba\u03c1eq [\u03bd\u03c3eq (M )/\u03b4c ]3 , where\n\u03b4c = 3(12\u03c0)2/3 /20 \u2243 1.686.\nThe tidal destruction of clumps is most effective at\nthe early epochs of the Galactic halo formation, when\nthe host density profiles are not finally established. The\ntidal interaction of clumps is a complicated process and\ndepends on many factors: a clump formation history,\nhost density profile, an existence of different substructures inside the host, orbital parameters of individual\nclumps in the hosts, etc. Only in numerical simulations\nall these factors can be taken into account properly. In\nthis paper we use a simplified approach by calculating an\nenergy gain per each tidal interaction and a number of\ntidal interactions per dynamical time in the hosts.\nAn internal energy of self-gravitating object increases\nin tidal interactions. This energy increase was calculated\ne. g. in [26] for the case of a star globular cluster in a\nspherical galaxy. By using the model of tidal heating\nfrom [26], we determine now a survival time (or a time of\ntidal destruction) T of some chosen small-scale clump due\nto the tidal heating inside of a larger mass host clump.\nThe motion of a clump would be rather complicated in\nthe case of a fast hierarchical clustering of hosts. During a dynamical time in the host tdyn \u2243 0.5(G\u03c1h )\u22121/2 ,\nwhere \u03c1h is a mean internal density of the host, the chosen small-scale clump can belong to several successively\ndestructed hosts. We will consider a typical clump orbit\ninside the host and assume for simplicity in this Section\nthe isothermal internal density profile of the clump.\nA clump trajectory in the host experiences successive\nturns accompanied by the \"tidal shocks\" [25, 26]. For\nthe considered small-scale clump with a mass M and radius R, the corresponding internal energy increase after\na single tidal shock is\n4\u03c0\n\u2206E \u2243\n\u03b31 G\u03c1h M R2 ,\n3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a numerical factor \u03b31 \u223c 1. Let us denote the\nnumber of tidal shocks per dynamical time tdyn by \u03b32 .\nA corresponding rate of clump internal energy growth is\n\u0116 = \u03b32 \u2206E/tdyn . A clump is destroyed in the host if\nits internal energy increase due to tidal shocks exceeds a\ntotal energy |E| \u2243 GM 2 /2R. As a result, for a typical\ntime T = T (\u03c1, \u03c1h ) of the tidal destruction of a small-scale\nclump with density \u03c1 inside a more massive host with a\ndensity \u03c1h we obtain:\n3/2\n\nT \u22121 (\u03c1, \u03c1h ) = \u0116/|E| \u2243 4\u03b31 \u03b32 G1/2 \u03c1h \u03c1\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nIt turns out that a resulting mass function of small-scale\nclumps (see in this Section below) depends rather weakly\non the value of \u03b31 \u03b32 .\nDuring the lifetime of an individual small-scale clump,\nit can sequentially inhabit in many host clumps of larger\nmass. After the tidal disruption of the first lightest host,\na small-scale clump becomes a constituent part of a heavier one, etc. The process of hierarchical transition of a\nsmall-scale clump from one host to another occurs almost continuously in time up to the final host formation,\nwhere the tidal interaction becomes inefficient.\nA corresponding mass fraction of small-scale clumps\nwith mass M escaping the tidal destruction in hierarchical clustering (or probability of clump survival) is given\nby the exponent function e\u2212J with\nJ\u2243\n\nX\nh\n\n\u2206th\n.\nT (\u03c1, \u03c1h )\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u2206th is a difference of formation times th of two successive hosts, and summation is over all clumps of intermediate mass-scales, which successively host the chosen\nsmall-scale clump of a mass M . By changing the summation to integration in (5) we obtain\n\nJ(\u03c1, \u03c1f ) =\n\nZtf\n\nt1\n\ndth\n\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c1f\n\u03c11\n\u2243\u03b3\n\u2243\u03b3\n,\nT (\u03c1, \u03c1h )\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u03b3 = 2\u03b31 \u03b32 \u03ba1/2 G1/2 \u03c11/2\neq teq \u2243 14(\u03b31 \u03b32 /3),\n\n(7)\n\nand t1 , tf , \u03c11 and \u03c1f are respectively the formation times\nand internal densities of the first and final hosts. It can\nbe seen from (6) that the first host provides a major contribution to the tidal destruction of small-scale clumps,\nespecially if the first host density \u03c11 is close to \u03c1, and\nconsequently e\u2212J \u226a 1.\nA mass function of small-scale clumps (i. e. a differential mass fraction of DM in the form of clumps survived\nin hierarchical clustering) can be expressed as\n2\ndM\n\u03be\nd\u03bd = dM d\u03bd (2/\u03c0) e\u2212\u03bd /2\nM\n\nZ\u03bd\n\n2\n\nd\u03bd1 e\u2212\u03bd1 /2\n\n0\n\n\u00d7\n\nZt0\n\ndt\u0303\n\n\u2202 2 F (M, t\u0303) \u2212J[\u03c1(\u03bd),\u03c1( t\u0303 )]\ne\n. (8)\n\u2202M \u2202 t\u0303\n\nt1 (\u03bd1 )\n\nIn this expression t0 is the present age of the Universe and F (M, t) is the mass fraction of unconfined\nclumps (i. e. clumps not belonging to the more massive\nhosts) with a mass smaller than M at time t. According to [12], the mass\n\u221a fraction of unconfined clumps is\nF (M, t) = erf(\u03b4c /[ 2\u03c3eq (M )D(t)]), where erf(x) is the\nerror-function and D(t) is the growth factor normalized\nby D(teq ) = 1. An upper integration limit t0 in (8) is\n\n\f4\n\n\u03be\n\n2\ndM\nd log \u03c3eq (M )\n1\nd\u03bd \u2243 \u221a e\u2212\u03bd /2 y(\u03bd) d\u03bd\ndM.\nM\ndM\n2\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nHere the numerically calculated function y(\u03bd) depends\nrather weakly on the parameter \u03b3 from (7) and is shown\nin the Fig. 1. By deriving (9), we take into account that\n\u03c3(M ) is a slowly varying function of clump mass M . For\nthe same reason, providing an integration in (8) we use\nthe dependance of t1 (\u03c11 ) only on the variable \u03bd by neglecting the dependance on M . Physically the rising of\ny(\u03bd) with \u03bd corresponds to a more effective survival of\nhigh-density clumps (i. e. with large values of \u03bd) with\nrespect to the low-density ones (with small values of \u03bd).\nIntegrating (9) over \u03bd, we obtain\n\u03beint\n\ndM\ndM\n\u2243 0.017(n + 3)\n.\nM\nM\n\n(10)\n\nThis mass function is in a reasonable agreement with\nthe similar one from (1) in the our earlier work [4]. An\neffective power-law index n in (10) is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202 log \u03c3eq (M )\nn = \u22123 1 + 2\n(11)\n\u2202 log M\nand depends very weakly on M . At the small mass-scales\none has approximately n \u2243 np \u2212 4. Equation (10) implies\nthat for the suitable values of n only a small fraction of\nclumps, about 0.1\u22120.5 %, survives the stage of hierarchical tidal destruction in the each logarithmic mass interval\n\u2206 log M \u223c 1. A simple M \u22121 shape of the mass function\n(10) is in a very good agreement with the corresponding\none obtained recently in the numerical simulations [20].\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\nyH\u039dL\n\nnot crucial and may be extrapolated to infinity because\na main contribution to the tidal destruction of clumps\nis provided by the early formed hosts at first steps of\nhierarchical clustering.\nTwo processes respond for a time evolution of the fraction \u2202F (M, t)/\u2202M dM of unconfined clumps in the mass\ninterval dM : (i) the formation of new clumps and (ii)\nthe capture of smaller clumps into the larger ones. Both\nthese processes are equally effective at the time when\n\u2202 2 F/(\u2202M \u2202t) = 0. To take into account the confined\nclumps (i. e. clumps in the hosts) we need only the 2nd\nprocess (ii) for the fraction \u2202F (M, t)/\u2202M . Nevertheless,\nin (8) it is used the fraction \u2202F (M, t)/\u2202M influenced\nby the both processes. This is not accurate at a typical\nformation time of clump with a mass M , when clump\ndensity is comparable with the density of hosts. Fortunately, for this time the exponent in (8) is very small,\ne\u2212J \u226a 1, as it can be seen from (6) and (7). Respectively, an uncertain contribution from the process (i) to\nthe integral (8) is also very small. Meanwhile, only the\nprocess (ii) dominates in the integration region where the\nexponent e\u2212J is not small. For this reason (8) provides\na suitable approximation for the mass fraction of clumps\nsurvived in the hierarchical clustering.\nFinally we transform the distribution function (8) to\nthe following form:\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n\u039d\n\nFIG. 1: Numerically calculated function y(\u03bd) from (9).\n\nIt must be stressed that a physical meaning of the survived clump distribution function \u03be d\u03bd dM/M is different\nfrom the similar one for the unconfined clumps, given\nby the Press-Schechter mass function \u2202F/\u2202M . For comparison, the Press-Schechter mass function of unconfined\nclumps [12] is\n\u0015\n\u0014\ndM\nd\u03c3eq\n2\u03b4c\n\u03b4c2\n\u03bePS (t)\ndM,\n= \u221a\nexp \u2212 2 2\n2 D(t) dM\nM\n2\u03c3eq D (t)\n2\u03c0\u03c3eq\n(12)\nwhere \u03c3eq = \u03c3eq (M ) The mass function of clumps survived in a hierarchical clustering (10) is several times less\nthan the Press-Schechter mass function (12) at a mean\ntime of clump formation with \u03c3eq (M )D(t) \u2243 \u03b4c .\nIn further calculations we will use an interpolation fitting of the fluctuation dispersion \u03c3eq (M ) from [27] (see\nalso [28]):\n2 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\u03c3eq (M ) \u2243 p\nfs (\u03a9\u039b )\n\n\u0012\n\nk\nkh0\n\n\u0013(np \u22121)/2 \u0014\n\nlog\n\n\u0012\n\nk\nkeq\n\n\u0013\u00153/2\n,\n\n(13)\nwhere the wave vector k \u221d M \u22121/3 , respectively keq and\nkh0 correspond to a mass inside the cosmological horizon\nat the moments teq and t0 , np is a primordial perturbation index, and fs (\u03a9\u039b ) = 1.04 \u2212 0.82\u03a9\u039b + 2\u03a92\u039b . It\nmust be noted that interpolation (13) is valid only for\nthe small-scale clumps, with M \u2264 103 M\u2299 . The analysis of the WMAP data of the CMB anisotropy [29] reveals a power-law spectrum of initial perturbations with\nnp = 0.99 \u00b1 0.04 in a good agreement with the canonical inflation value np = 1.0. However, when the data\nfrom 2dF galaxy power-spectrum and Ly-\u03b1 are included\nin the analysis, the best-fit favors in a softer spectrum\nwith np = 0.96 \u00b1 0.02. Nevertheless, the recent observations does not exclude even the values np = 1.1.\nNote that a differential number density of small-scale\nclumps in the Galactic halo n(M ) dM \u221d dM/M 2 from\n(10) coincides not only with a similar one from the recent numerical simulations of small-scale clumps [20] but\nis also very close to that obtained in the numerical simulations for large-scale clumps with mass M \u2265 106 M\u2299 .\n\n\f5\n\n\u03b5=\n\nM\nZmax\n\nAM 1\u2212\u03bb dM.\n\n(14)\n\n1020\n\u0395=0.2, \u039b=2\ndN\u0090dHlog ML\n\nSee Fig. 2 for a comparison.\nStrictly speaking, our calculations are not valid for\nlarge-scale clumps because of their continuing tidal destruction in the halo up to the present epoch t0 and the\naccretion of the additional large-scale clumps into the\nhalo from the intergalactic space. Nevertheless, our approach remains valid even for the large-scale clumps in\nthe narrow mass range, where the power-law perturbation spectrum can be used as a rather good approximation.\nIn the Fig. 2 a differential number density of smallscale clumps from (10) is shown by the solid line. As\nit was noted above, the region of validity for this curve\nis M \u2264 103 M\u2299 . For larger masses an extrapolation is\nshown (right part of the solid line). The corresponding\nmass functions from numerical simulations can be parameterized in the form \u03be(M ) dM/M = AM 1\u2212\u03bb dM . The\nconstant A can be determined by fixing a power-law index\n\u03bb and a fraction \u03b5 of the halo mass in the form of clumps\nwith mass from Mmin \u2243 106 M\u2299 to Mmax \u2243 1010 M\u2299 :\n\n\u0395=0.15, \u039b=1.9\n\n1015\n\n\u0395=0.05, \u039b=1.78\nEquation H10L\n\n1010\n\n105\n\n10-5\n\n100\n\n105\n\n1010\n\nM\u0090M\u009f\n\nFIG. 2: A differential number of small clumps in the Galaxy\nfrom (10) for np = 1.0 is shown by the solid line.

Observations of the Galactic halo lensing [32] give a smaller\nclump fraction value, \u03b5 \u2243 0.02. One can see in the Fig. 2\na reasonable agreement between the extrapolation of our\ncalculations and the corresponding numerical simulations\nof the large-scale clumps.\n\nIII.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF CLUMPS BY DISK\n\nCrossing the Galactic disc, a clump can be tidally destructed by the collective gravitational field of stars in the\ndisc. This phenomenon is similar to the destruction of a\nglobular cluster by the \"tidal shocking\" in the Galactic\ndisc [33].\nThe rate of energy gain per unit mass due to the tidal\nshocking was calculated in [33]:\nd\u1ebc\n4g 2 (\u2206z)2\n.\n= m 2\ndt\nTc vz,c\n\n(16)\n\nHere gm is the maximum gravitational acceleration acquired by the constituent DM particle of the clump moving in the gravitational field of the disk, \u2206z = is a vertical\n(perpendicular to the disk plane) distance of a DM particle from the clump center, Tc is an orbital period of\nclump in the halo, vz,c is a vertical velocity of disk crossing. In (16) the two crossings of disk by a globular cluster\nduring the orbital period Tc is assumed, while only one\ndisk crossing is typical in the case of elongated orbits of\nDM clumps in the halo (see below).\nA surface mass of the Galactic disk can be approximated by a simple exponential law [34]\n\u03c3s (r) =\n\nMd \u2212r/r0\n,\ne\n2\u03c0r02\n\n(17)\n\nwith Md = 8 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 and r0 = 4.5 kpc. The maximum\ngravitational acceleration during the disk crossing is\ngm (r) = 2\u03c0G\u03c3s (r).\n\n(18)\n\nFollowing to [21], we use a power-law parametrization of\nthe internal density profile of DM clumps:\n3 \u2212 \u03b2 \u0010 r \u0011\u2212\u03b2\n,\n(19)\n\u03c1int (r) =\n\u03c1\n3\nR\n\nwhere \u03c1 and R is respectively a mean internal density and\nradius of clump, \u03b2 = 1.7 \u2212 1.8 and we put \u03c1int (r) = 0\nat r > R. The corresponding power-law profile of smallscale clumps with \u03b2 \u2243 1.5 \u2212 2 has been recently found\nin numerical simulations [20]. For this profile a total\n(kinetic and potential) energy of a clump is given by\n|E| =\n\n3 \u2212 \u03b2 GM 2\n.\n2(5 \u2212 2\u03b2) R\n\n(20)\n\n\f6\nIntegrating (16) over the clump volume with the profile\n(19), one can obtain a total rate of energy gain by clump\ndE/dt and then a time of clump destruction by the disk:\n|E|\n2(5 \u2212 \u03b2)\ntd =\n=\n3(5 \u2212 2\u03b2)\n\u0116\n\n2\nGTc \u03c1vz,c\n.\n2\ngm\n\n\u03c1H (r) =\n(21)\n\nNote that the adiabatic correction for the disk shocking\n(see e. g. [35]) is very small in the case of DM clumps\nand may be neglected.\nTo estimate the tidal shocking effect produced by different parts of the Galactic disk at radial distance r, let\nus consider at first a toy halo model by assuming the circular orbits of DM clumps. Then a disk crossing velocity\nvz,c equals to a circular velocity:\nvz,c\n\n\u0014\n\nGMH (r)\n= vrot (r) =\nr\n\n\u00151/2\n\n,\n\nWe suppose here for simplicity a pure isothermal density profile of the halo\n\n(22)\n\nwhere MH (r) is a halo mass inside the sphere of radius r.\nUsing for a clump orbital period Tc = 2\u03c0r/vrot (r), one\nfinally finds\n(5 \u2212 \u03b2) r04 \u03c1MH (r)r1/2 2r/r0\n.\ne\n3\u03c0(5 \u2212 2\u03b2)\nG1/2 Md2\n\n2\nU (r) = mvH\n[log(r/RH ) \u2212 1],\n\nZ0 p\n5/2\nE \u2212 U (r) f (E) dE,\n\u03c1H (r) = 2 \u03c0\n\n(24)\n\n2\nL2\n[E \u2212 U (r)] \u2212 2 2 .\nm\nm r\n\n\u1e592 =\n\nd\nf (E) = 3/2 2\n2 \u03c0 dE\n\nZ\u221e\n\nr(E)\n\ndr\nd\u03c1H (r)\np\n, (25)\nE \u2212 U (r) dr\n\nwhere U (r) is a gravitational potential energy and function r = r(E) is defined by the equation U [r(E)] = E.\n\n(28)\n\nBy introducing the dimensionless variables\ns=\n\nr\n,\nRH\n\nx=\n\nE\n2 ,\nmvH\n\ny=\n\nL2\n\n2 m2 v 2 ,\nRH\nH\n\n(29)\n\nthe equation for the turning points, \u1e592 = 0, in the potential (27) can be written as\ny\n= 2(x \u2212 log s + 1).\ns2\n\n(30)\n\nThe derivatives of the left and right sides of this equation\nare equal at s = y 1/2 . Respectively, the roots smin (x, y)\nand smax (x, y) of (30) satisfy the condition smin (x, y) <\ny 1/2 < smax (x, y). A condition for the existence of the\nsolution of (30) is x \u2265 (log y \u2212 1)/2. The equality in this\ncondition corresponds to the circular orbit with smin =\nsmax . From (28) one can determine the orbital period:\nRH\nTc (x, y) = 2\nvH\n\nsZmax\n\nsmin\n\nds\u2032\np\n.\n2(x \u2212 log s\u2032 + 1) \u2212 y/s\u20322\n\n(31)\n\nIn the following we will solve (30) and find the orbital period Tc (x, y) from (31) numerically. Denoting p = cos \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 is an angle between the radius-vector ~r and the\nparticle velocity ~v , we have\ny = 2(1 \u2212 p2 )s2 (x \u2212 log s + 1).\n\n(32)\n\nWe find from (25) the distribution function of particles\nwith an energy x < \u22121 by using the density profile (26)\nwith a cutoff at r = RH :\n\nU(r)\n\n1\n\n(27)\n\nwhere m is a mass of DM particle. The radial motion of\na particle with mass m and angular momentum L in the\nspherical potential obeys the equation\n\n(23)\n\nComparison of a clump destruction time td from (23)\nwith the Universe age t0 shows that all clumps with the\ninternal density \u03c1 < 2 \u00d7 10\u221222 g cm\u22123 are effectively\ndestructed within the radius r < 15 kpc from the Galactic\ncenter. In particular, the major part of the Moon-mass\nclumps with M = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 , np = 1 and \u03bd = 2 do not\nsurvive inside the central 15 kpc.\nHowever, in the real Galactic halo the DM clumps have\nan elongated orbits in general. These orbits cross the\nstellar Galactic disk only once during the orbital period.\nTherefore, we must introduce a factor 2 in (21) for these\norbits. At the same time it is a much more important that\nclumps with elongated orbits have the longer orbital periods Tc than in the previous toy model. This elongation\nof orbits significantly increases the probability of clump\nsurvival.\nAs an example let us consider the Galactic halo model\nwith an isotropic velocity distribution. This model is appropriate for the halo formed by the hierarchial clustering\nof clumps. In this model according to [36] the energy distribution function f (E) of DM particles is related with\nthe density profile of the halo \u03c1H (r) as\n\n(26)\n\nwhere vH = (GMH /RH )1/2 is the halo rotational velocity\nand RH is the Galactic halo radius. At r > RH we put\n\u03c1H (r) = 0. In the absence of an analytical model of the\nfinite isothermal sphere, we construct a simplified model\nwhich approximates the isothermal sphere in the inner\nregion, at r \u226a RH .

See in the\nFigs. 4\u20136 the resulting probabilities of clump survival in\nthe Galaxy (or fractions of clumps survived the tidal destruction).\nNote that the probability of clump survival Pd (r) in\n(35) is an approximate expression averaged over an angle between the plane of the Galactic disk and the clump\norbit plane. In the real Galactic halo there must be some\nanisotropy in clump distribution with respect to the disk\nplane. For example, the clumps with orbits in the Galactic disk plane are destructed more efficiently than ones\noutside the Galactic plane.\nIV.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF CLUMPS BY STARS\n\nThe internal energy increase of a clump during a single\nstar flyby is\nZ\n1\n\u2206E =\nd3 r \u03c1int (r)(vz \u2212 \u1e7dz )2 ,\n(36)\n2\n\nwhere vz is a velocity increase of constituent DM particle\ninside a clump in the direction of axis z and \u1e7dz is a similar\none for a clump center-of-mass. The axis z is directed\nalong the line connecting a clump center-of-mass with\na star at the moment of a star closest approach. In the\nimpulse approximation, by neglecting the internal motion\nof DM particles in a clump during the star encounter and\nassuming the straight line orbit of a star (see e. g. [26])\nwe have\n\u2202vz\n\u2202vz\n\u2206l =\nr cos \u03c8,\n(37)\nvz \u2212 \u1e7dz \u2243\n\u2202l\n\u2202l\n\n4\nnp =1.1\n3\nl* \u0090R\n\nNote that the isotropic distribution function (33) reproduces the density profile (26) only in the inner halo region, at r \u226a RH . The assumed isotropy of particle distribution (i. e. an independence of distribution function\non the particle angular momentum L) is violated near\nthe boundary of the halo, at r \u2243 RH . Nevertheless, the\ndistribution function (33) is adequate for our purpose because a tidal destruction of clumps by the Galactic disk\ntakes place only in the inner halo region, at r \u226a RH . At\nthe same time, in the considered model the clumps on the\nouter orbits, at r \u2243 RH , provide only small contribution\nto the halo density at r \u226a RH . Neglecting these outer\nclumps, we can define the probability of clump survival\nin tidal destruction by the Galactic disk (or the fraction\nof survived clumps) as a function of radius r = sRH in\nthe following form:\n\nnp =1.0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n10-7\n\n10-8\n\n10-6\n\n10-5\n\nM\u0090M\u009f\n\nFIG. 3: The fraction l\u2217 /R according to (42) as a function\nof clump mass M at the distance from the Galactic center\nr = 2 kpc, \u03bd = 2 and np = 1.0 and np = 1.1 respectively.\n\nwhere l is the distance of a star closest approach to a DM\nclump and \u03c8 is a polar angle in the spherical coordinates.\nLet us vrel is relative velocity of a star with respect\nto a DM clump. In the approximation of a rectilinear\nmotion, an angle \u03c6 between the line connecting a clump\ncenter-of-mass and ~vrel evolves as\nd\u03c6\nvrel\n=\u2212\ncos2 \u03c6.\ndt\nl\n\n(38)\n\nChanging a variable t to \u03c6 in the Newton equation of\nmotion, one gets\nGm\u2217\ndvz\n=\u2212\ncos \u03c6,\nd\u03c6\nvrel l\n\n(39)\n\nwhere m\u2217 is a typical star mass. After integration of this\nequation we obtain\nvz =\n\n2Gm\u2217\n.\nvrel l\n\n(40)\n\nNow by integrating (36) over a clump volume with a density profile \u03c1int (r) from (19), we find in the case of l > R:\n\u2206E =\n\n2(3 \u2212 \u03b2) G2 M R2 m2\u2217\n.\n2 l4\n3(5 \u2212 \u03b2)\nvrel\n\n(41)\n\nThe opposite case l < R was considered e. g. in [4]. It is\neasily verified that the maximum internal energy increase\noccurs for a star flyby with l \u2243 R.\nAt this step we must distinguish two cases: (i) clump\ndestruction during a single star flyby and (ii) clump destruction after numerous star collisions. In the first case a\nthreshold for clump destruction is achieved at \u2206E = |E|,\nwhere a total energy of clump E is given by (20). From\nthe equality \u2206E = |E| one finds the maximal impact\nparameter l\u2217 for a single flyby destruction\n\u0012\n\nl\u2217\nR\n\n\u00134\n\n=\n\n4(5 \u2212 2\u03b2) Gm2\u2217\n2 \u223c\n3(5 \u2212 \u03b2) M Rvrel\n\n\u0012\n\nV\nvrel\n\n\u00132 \u0010\n\nm\u2217 \u00112\n, (42)\nM\n\n\f8\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nhalo\n\nhalo\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\ndisk\n\nPHrL\n\nPHrL\n\ndisk\ntotal\n\ntotal\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n5\n\n15\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr, kpc\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nr, kpc\n\nFIG. 4: The fraction of clumps with mass M = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299\nand peak-height \u03bd = 2 survived a tidal destruction in the\nGalactic disc Pd , in the Galactic halo PH and the resulting\ntotal fraction Ptot = PH Pd as a function of distance from the\nGalactic center.

Following to [37] we approximate the radial\n\nnumber density distribution of stars in the bulge in the\nradial range r = 1 \u2212 3 kpc as\n\u0003\n\u0002\nnb,\u2217 (r) = (\u03c1b /m\u2217 ) exp \u2212(r/rb )1.6 ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03c1b = 8M\u2299 /pc3 and rb = 1 kpc. By using (47)\ntogether with (45) or (46) it can be shown that inside\nthe bulge, at r \u2264 3 kpc, all small-scale clumps with M \u2265\n10\u22128 M\u2299 are tidally destructed during the Hubble time,\ni. e. t\u2217 \u226a t0 . Therefore, there is an empty cavity in\nclump distribution in the Galactic center with a radius\nr \u2243 3 kpc as it can be shown in the Figs. 4\u20136.\nWhat is a fate of the core of a tidally destructed\nclump? Let us consider the scaling of destruction time t\u2217\nin dependence on a varying clump radius r and mass\nM (r) \u221d r3\u2212\u03b2 . According to (45) or (46), a time of\nclump destruction is scaled respectively as t\u2217 \u221d r\u2212\u03b2/2\nor t\u2217 \u221d r2\u2212\u03b2 . For surviving of the core, it is necessary\nthat t\u2217 \u2192 0 at r \u2192 0. This is possible only if the internal density profile \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b2 is rather steep, \u03b2 > 2.\nMeanwhile, both the theoretical models and numerical\nsimulations predict \u03b2 < 2, and therefore, the core does\nnot survive during the tidal destruction of DM clump.\n\n\f9\nB.\n\nDestruction of clumps in the halo\n\nThe radial number density distribution of stars in the\nGalactic halo (outside the Galactic disk) at radii r >\n3 kpc can be approximated as\nnh,\u2217 (r) = (\u03c1\u2299 /m\u2217 )(r\u2299 /r)3 ,\n\n(48)\n\n1\n0.75\n0.5\nPtotHrL\n0.25\n0\n\n100\n80\n\nwhere \u03c1\u2299 = 10\u22124 M\u2299 /pc3 and r\u2299 = 8.5 kpc. The stellar density profile in the Galactic halo is rather poorly\nknown, and so (48) must be considered only as an upper\nlimit [24]. We will describe the distribution of clumps\nin the halo the same way as in the Section III. To take\ninto account a varying number density of stars nh,\u2217 (r),\nwe made an averaging of the rate of clump destruction by\nstars t\u22121\n\u2217 along the orbital trajectory during the orbital\nperiod:\n\nht\u22121\n\u2217 (x, y)i =\n\n2RH\nvH Tc (x, y)\n\nsZmax\n\nsmin\n\nds\u2032 t\u22121\n\u2217\np\n.\n2(x \u2212 log s\u2032 + 1) \u2212 y/s\u20322\n\n(49)\nIn this expression the dimensionless variables x and y are\nfrom (29), a clump orbital period Tc (x, y) is from (31) and\ndestruction time of clump t\u2217 is from (45)\npor (46) with the\nreplacements ns \u21d2 nh,\u2217 (r) and vrel \u21d2 2[E \u2212 U (r)]/m.\nThe averaging procedure\n(49) is in fact the integration of\nR\nenergy gain rate \u0116dt along the clump orbit.\nThe resulting probability of clump survival in tidal\ndestruction by the Galactic halo stars PH (r) is defined\nby a similar expression as (35) but with a replacement\n\u22121\ne\u2212t0 /td \u21d2 e\u2212t0 ht\u2217 (x,y)i , where ht\u22121\n\u2217 (x, y)i is from (49).\nThe results of numerical calculations of the tidal destruction of DM clumps by different Galactic components\nare summarized in the Figs. 4\u20136. These calculations were\nperformed for DM clumps originated from fluctuations\nwith the peak-height \u03bd = 2.\nCorrespondingly 32%, 27% and 18% of clumps survive\nthe destruction by the Galactic disk tidal shocking at\nthe Sun position, r\u2299 = 8.5 kpc, for clump masses M =\n2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 , M = 10\u22126 M\u2299 and M = 10\u22123 M\u2299 . The\nGalactic disk destroys clumps even outside its boundary, at r > 15 kpc, because some of DM clumps with\nthe extended orbits intersect the Galactic disk in the inner part of the halo. The destruction of clumps by the\nGalactic disk becomes inefficient at r > 40 kpc. The respective fractions of clumps of the same masses surviving\nthe tidal destruction by stars in the Galactic halo (outside the Galactic disk) are 66%, 63% and 57%. The final\nfractions of clumps of the same masses survived the tidal\ndestruction both by the Galactic disk and stars in the\nGalactic halo P (r\u2299 ) = PH (r\u2299 )Pd (r\u2299 ) are 21%, 17% and\n10% respectively.\nIn the Fig. 7 the fraction of survived small-scale clumps\nin the Galactic halo is shown in dependance on a mean\ninternal density of small-scale clumps.\n\n60\nr, kpc 40\n\n10-22\n10\n\n20\n-24\n\n0\n\n-23\n\n\u03a1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 7: The survived fraction of small-scale clumps Ptot (r) in\nthe Galactic halo inside the radial distance r \u2264 100 kpc. A\nmean internal density of clump \u03c1 is in g cm\u22123 .\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe calculated the number density distribution of\nsmall-scale DM clumps in the Galactic halo in dependance on a clump mass M , radius R (expressed through\nthe fluctuation peak-height \u03bd) and radial distance r to\nthe Galactic center. These calculations were performed\nby taking into account the tidal destruction of clumps in\nthe early hierarchical clustering and later in the Galaxy.\nCalculations of the distribution function of small-scale\nclumps are carried out, following to [4], in the framework\nof the standard cosmological model and the hierarchical\nmodel of structure formation. The primeval power spectrum of density perturbations P (k) \u221d k np is taken from\nthe inflation models with np \u2243 1 (the Harrison-Zeldovich\nspectrum). In this model the small-scale clumps are\nformed earlier than the bigger ones. The minimal mass\nMmin of clumps is determined by the free streaming of\nDM particles from a growing fluctuation. The value of\nMmin is a model dependent quantity. For neutralino as\nDM particle, the minimal mass Mmin is given by (2), and\nit is the Moon-scale mass.\nIn the process of hierarchical clustering the small\nclumps are captured by the bigger ones, and so on. Thus\nthe hierarchical structure is formed, when all clumps consist in part the smaller ones and the free DM particles.\nSome part of DM clumps are tidally disrupted in the\ngravitational field of the bigger host clumps. In this scenario we calculated the differential distribution of the\nsurvived clumps given by (9) as a function of two independent parameters: e. g. a clump mass M and fluctuation peak-height \u03bd (or a clump mass M and radius\nR). The corresponding integral mass function is given\nby (10), where the small factor \u03beint \u2243 0.017(n + 3) gives\nthe mass fraction of clumps survived the tidal destruction\nin the hierarchical structuring.\nThe predicted differential number density of small\n\n\f10\nclumps \u03be(M ) (\u03c1H /M ) dM/M is very close to our previous\ncalculations [4], and both are in a good agreement with\nthe recent results of numerical simulations [20].\nOur calculations are valid only for small-scale clumps\nwith masses M \u2264 103 M\u2299 . The physics of larger mass\nclumps is rather different. For large-scale clumps the\ndynamical friction, tidal stripping and accretion of new\nclumps into the halo proceed in a different way. Nevertheless, the calculated mass function is in a good agreement with a mass function of the large clumps (obtained\nin the numerical simulations) in the intermediate mass\nrange (see in the Fig. 2).\nThe mutual tidal destruction of small-scale DM clumps\nis effective only at the early stage of hierarchical clustering. At later stages the DM clumps are additionally destructed by stars and by the collective gravitational field\nof the Galactic disc. In the Galaxy at radial distance\nr \u2264 3 kpc all small-scale clumps are destructed by stars\nin the central bulge. At radial distances in the range\nr = 3 \u2212 40 kpc the DM clumps are destructed by stars\nfrom the halo and by the tidal shocking in the Galactic\ndisk. The latter provides the major contribution to the\ntidal destruction of clumps outside the bulge. Only 21%,\n17% and 10% of clumps survive the tidal destruction near\nthe Sun position for clump masses M = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 ,\nM = 10\u22126 M\u2299 and M = 10\u22123 M\u2299 respectively. Our results on the tidal destruction of clumps differ from both\n[22, 23] and [24], with the intermediate conclusions. At\n\nradial distances r > 40 kpc the destruction of clumps\nby the Galactic disk becomes inefficient, and the number\ndensity of clumps is determined only by the early epoch\nof hierarchical clustering.\nThe tidal destruction of clumps by the Galactic disk\nand stars affects the annihilating signal mainly in the central region of the Galaxy where destructions are most effective. Therefore, a growing fraction of survived clumps\nP (r) smooths the anisotropy of the awaited annihilation\nsignal at the Sun position. A local annihilation rate is\nproportional to the clumps number density and, respectively, to P (r). For example, at the position of the Sun\nthe 17% of clumps survive, and so the local annihilation\nrate more then 5 times less in comparison with the P = 1\ncase.\n\n[1] J. Silk and H.
