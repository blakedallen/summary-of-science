Using a dictionary translating a variety of classical\nand modern covering properties into combinatorial properties of\ncontinuous images, we get a simple way to understand the interrelations between these properties in ZFC and in the realm of the\ntrichotomy axiom for upward closed families of sets of natural numbers. While it is now known that the answer to the Hurewicz 1927\nproblem is positive, it is shown here that semifilter trichotomy implies a negative answer to a slightly stronger form of this problem.\n\n1. Introduction and basic facts\nUnless otherwise indicated, all spaces considered here are assumed to\nbe separable, zero-dimensional, and metrizable. Consequently, we may\nassume that all open covers are countable [20]. Since every such space\nis homeomorphic to a set of real numbers, our results can be thought\nof as dealing with sets of reals.\n1.1. Covering properties. Fix a space X. An open cover U of X is\nlarge if each member of X is contained in infinitely many members of\nU. U is an \u03c9-cover if X is not in U and for each finite F \u2286 X, there\nis U \u2208 U such that F \u2286 U. U is a \u03b3-cover of X if it is infinite and for\neach x \u2208 X, x is a member of all but finitely many members of U.\nLet O, \u039b, \u03a9, and \u0393 denote the collections of all countable open\ncovers, large covers, \u03c9-covers, and \u03b3-covers of X, respectively. Let\nA and B be any of these classes. We consider the following three\nproperties which X may or may not have.\nS1 (A , B): For each sequence {Un }n\u2208N of members of A , there exist members Un \u2208 Un , n \u2208 N, such that {Un : n \u2208 N} \u2208 B.\nSfin (A , B): For each sequence {Un }n\u2208N of members\nS of A , there exist finite\nsubsets Fn \u2286 Un , n \u2208 N, such that n\u2208N Fn \u2208 B.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 03E17; Secondary: 37F20.\nKey words and phrases. Scheepers property, semifilter trichotomy.\nSupported by the Koshland Center for Basic Research.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nUfin (A , B): For each sequence {Un }n\u2208N of members of A which do not contain a finite subcover, there exist finite subsets Fn \u2286 Un , n \u2208 N,\nsuch that {\u222aFn : n \u2208 N} \u2208 B.\nIt was shown by Scheepers [17] and by Just, Miller, Scheepers, and\nSzeptycki [10] that each of these properties, when A , B range over\nO, \u039b, \u03a9, \u0393, is either void or equivalent to one in the following diagram\n(where an arrow denotes implication). For these properties, O can be\nreplaced anywhere by \u039b without changing the property.\n/ Sfin (O, O)\n/ Ufin (O, \u03a9)\nU (O, \u0393)\n5\n5 fin\n7\nk\nl\nk\nl\no\noo\nkkk\no\nlll\nk\nl\no\nl\nl\noo\nlll\nSfin (\u0393, \u03a9)\nooo\no\nlll\n5\nO\no\nl\nk\nl\no\nl\nkk\nooo\nlll\nkkk\n/\n/\nS1 (\u0393, \u0393)\nS1 (\u0393, \u03a9)\nS1 (\u0393, O)\nO\nO\nO\nSfin (\u03a9, \u03a9)\n\n5\nkkk\nkkk\nS1 (\u03a9, \u0393)\n\n/ S1 (O, O)\n\n/ S1 (\u03a9, \u03a9)\n\nSfin (O, O), Ufin (O, \u0393), S1 (O, O) are the the classical properties of\nMenger, Hurewicz, and Rothberger (C \u2032\u2032 ), respectively. S1 (\u03a9, \u0393) is the\nGerlits-Nagy \u03b3-property. Additional properties in the diagram were\nstudied by Arkhangel'ski\u01d0, Sakai, and others. Some of the properties\nare relatively new.\nWe also consider the following type of properties.\nSplit(A , B): Every cover U \u2208 A can be split into two disjoint subcovers V\nand W which contain elements of B.\nHere too, letting A , B \u2208 {\u039b, \u03a9, \u0393} we get that some of the properties\nare trivial and several equivalences hold among the remaining ones.\nThe surviving properties are\nSplit(\u039b, \u039b)\n/\n\nO\n\nSplit(\u03a9, \u0393)\n\nSplit(\u03a9, \u039b)\n\n/\n\nO\n\nSplit(\u03a9, \u03a9)\n\nand no implication can be added to the diagram [20]. There are connections between the first and the second diagram, e.g., Split(\u03a9, \u0393) =\nS1 (\u03a9, \u0393) [20], and both Ufin (O, \u0393) and S1 (O, O) imply Split(\u039b, \u039b). Similarly, Scheepers proved that S1 (\u03a9, \u03a9) implies Split(\u03a9, \u03a9) [17].\nLet C, C\u039b , C\u03a9 , and C\u0393 denote the collections of all countable clopen\ncovers, large covers, \u03c9-covers, and \u03b3-covers of X, respectively.\n\n\fCOMBINATORIAL IMAGES AND SEMIFILTER TRICHOTOMY\n\n3\n\nIt is often the case that we do not get anything new if we replace\nan ordered pair of families of open covers by the corresponding ordered\npair of families of clopen covers. However, some problems remain open.\nProblem 1.1. Is any of the properties\n(1) Sfin (\u0393, \u03a9), S1 (\u0393, \u0393), S1 (\u0393, \u03a9), S1 (\u0393, O);\n(2) Split(\u039b, \u039b), Split(\u03a9, \u039b), Split(\u03a9, \u03a9);\nequivalent to the corresponding property for clopen covers?\nIn any case, the clopen version of each property is formally weaker.\n\n1.2. Combinatorial images. The Baire space NN and the Cantor\nspace {0, 1}N are both equipped with the product topology. P (N), the\ncollection of all subsets of N, is identified with {0, 1}N via characteristic functions, and inherits its topology. The Rothberger space [N]\u05d00 ,\nconsisting of all infinite sets of natural numbers, is a subspace of P (N)\nand is homeomorphic to NN .\nFor a, b \u2208 [N]\u05d00 , a is an almost subset of b, a \u2286\u2217 b, if a \\ b is finite.\nDefinition 1.2. A semifilter is a nonempty family F \u2286 [N]\u05d00 containing all almost-supersets of its elements. For a nonempty family\nS \u2286 [N]\u05d00 ,\nhSi = {b \u2208 [N]\u05d00 : (\u2203a \u2208 S) a \u2286\u2217 b}\nis the semifilter generated by S. If F = hSi, then we say that S is\na base for F . A filter is a semifilter closed under finite intersections,\nand a subbase for a filter is a family which, after closing under finite\nintersections, becomes a base for that filter.\nThe names of the combinatorial notions in the following dictionary\nare standard, and a good reference for these is Blass' [4]. We say that\ng \u2208 NN is a guessing function for Y \u2286 NN if for each f \u2208 Y , g(n) = f (n)\nfor infinitely many n. In this case, we say that Y is guessable. The\nfollowing will be used throughout the paper without further notice.\nDictionary 1.3. The negation of each property in the left column of\nthe following table is equivalent to having a continuous image in the\nrelevant space (NN in the first block, and [N]\u05d00 in the second) with the\ncorresponding property in the right column.\n\n\f4\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nSfin (O, O)\ndominating\n[14]\nUfin (O, \u0393)\nunbounded\n[14]\nS1 (O, O)\nnot guessable\n[14]\nUfin (O, \u03a9)\nfinitely-dominating [19]\nSplit(C\u039b , C\u039b ) reaping\n[20]\nSplit(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ) ultrafilter base\n[20]\nSplit(C\u03a9 , C\u03a9 ) ultrafilter subbase\n[20]\nSplit(CT , CT ) simple P -point base [20]\nThe analogous assertions for countable Borel covers, with \"continuous\"\nreplaced by \"Borel\", also hold [18, 20].\n1.3. Semifilter trichotomy, reformulated. We now define one of\nthe paper's main tools. Recall that the Fr\u00e9chet filter is the set of all\ncofinite subsets of N.\nDefinition 1.4. For a \u2208 [N]\u05d00 and an increasing h \u2208 NN , define\na/h = {n : a \u2229 [h(n), h(n+1)) 6= \u2205}.\nFor S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 , define S/h = {a/h : a \u2208 S}. semifilter trichotomy is the\nstatement: For each semifilter S, there is an increasing h \u2208 NN such\nthat S/h is either the Fr\u00e9chet filter, or an ultrafilter, or [N]\u05d00 .\nRemark 1.5. Semifilter trichotomy is consistent: Blass and Laflamme\n[5], using a model invented for another purpose in Blass and Shelah [6],\nproved that the inequality u < g, where u is the ultrafilter number and\ng is the groupwise density number, is consistent. Laflamme [12] proved\nthat semifilter trichotomy follows from u < g.\nIn fact, Blass proved that semifilter trichotomy also implies u < g\n[3], and thus semifilter trichotomy is equivalent to u < g.\nWhen speaking of an element a \u2208 [N]\u05d00 as an element of NN , we\ndo this by identifying a with its increasing enumeration. This identification gives a homeomorphism from [N]\u05d00 onto the set of increasing\nelements in NN . Thus, we say that a family S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 is unbounded if\nit is unbounded when viewed as a subset of NN .\nDefinition 1.6. An increasing h \u2208 NN is a (flat) slalom for a family S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 if for each a \u2208 S, for all but finitely many n, a \u2229\n[h(n), h(n+1)) 6= \u2205.\nIt is easy to see (e.g., [21]) that S has a slalom if, and only if, it is\nbounded.\nCorollary 1.7. A family S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 is bounded if, and only if, there is\nan increasing h \u2208 NN such that hS/hi is the Fr\u00e9chet filter.\n\n\fCOMBINATORIAL IMAGES AND SEMIFILTER TRICHOTOMY\n\n5\n\nProof. hS/hi is the Fr\u00e9chet filter if, and only if, for each a \u2208 S, a/h is\ncofinite, that is, h a slalom for S.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.8. The following assertions are equivalent:\n(1) Semifilter trichotomy.\n(2) For each unbounded S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 , there is an increasing h \u2208 NN\nsuch that S/h is a base for either an ultrafilter, or for [N]\u05d00 .\n(3) For each unbounded S \u2286 [N]\u05d00 , there is an increasing h \u2208 NN\nsuch that S/h is reaping.\nProof. (1 \u21d4 2) S/h is always a base for hSi/h. Use Corollary 1.7.\n(2 \u21d2 3) Is trivial.\n(3 \u21d2 1) Each intersection of two unbounded semifilters is unbounded\n[4]. Let S be a semifilter, and assume that for each h, S/h 6= [N]\u05d00 and\nis not the Fr\u00e9chet filter. Then the same is true for S + = {a \u2208 [N]\u05d00 :\nac 6\u2208 S}. Let U be an ultrafilter. As S + , U are unbounded, F = S + \u2229U\nis unbounded. Thus, there is h such that the semifilter F/h is reaping.\nAs F/h is a reaping subset of an ultrafilter U/h, F/h = U/h. It\nfollows that U/h \u2286 S + /h, and as U/h is an ultrafilter, we have that\nS/h = (S + /h)+ \u2286 (U/h)+ = U/h is an ultrafilter.\n\u0003\n2. Warm up: Three basic results in ZFC\nThe results below were originally proved using sophisticated manipulations of open covers. The combinatorial proofs given here are direct\ngeneralizations of arguments from the theory of cardinal characteristics\nof the continuum.\nTheorem 2.1 (Scheepers [17]). Ufin (O, \u0393) implies Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ).\nProof. Assume that Y \u2286 [N]\u05d00 is a continuous image of X. As X has\nthe Hurewicz property, Y has a slalom\nh [21]. It suffices to show that\nS\nY is not reaping. Indeed, let a = n [h(2n), h(2n+1)). Then for each\ny \u2208 Y , both y \u2229 a and y \u2229 ac are infinite.\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 2.2 (Scheepers [17]). S1 (O, O) implies Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ).\n\nProof. Assume that X satisfies S1 (O, O), and Y Q\n\u2286 [N]\u05d00 is a continuous image of X. For each y \u2208 Y , define fy \u2208 n [N]2n by fy (n) =\n{y(1), . . . , y(2n)}.\neach n, we can identify [N]2n with N and therefore identify\nQ For 2n\nwith NN in a natural way. Z = {fy : y \u2208 Y }Q\nis a continuous imn [N]\nage of Y , and thus there is a guessing function g \u2208 n [N]2n for Z. For\neach n, let in , jn be distinct members of g(n)\\{i1 , . . . , in\u22121 , j1 , . . . , jn\u22121 }.\nTake I = {in : n \u2208 N}, J = {jn : n \u2208 N}.\n\n\f6\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nFor each y \u2208 Y there are infinitely many n such that g(n) = fy (n),\nand therefore both I \u2229 y and J \u2229 y are infinite. As I \u2229 J = \u2205, Y is not\nreaping.\n\u0003\nScheepers proved in [17] that S1 (\u03a9, \u03a9) implies Split(\u03a9, \u03a9). Ko\u010dinac\nand Scheepers [11] proved that if all finite powers of X satisfy Ufin (O, \u0393),\nthen X satisfies Split(\u03a9, \u03a9). Both results are generalized in a single result from [20], asserting that if all finite powers of X satisfy Split(\u03a9, \u039b),\nthen X satisfies Split(\u03a9, \u03a9). The same proof works in the clopen case,\nbut it is quite complicated. We give a simple proof.\nTheorem 2.3 ([20]). If all finite powers of X satisfy Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ),\nthen X satisfies Split(C\u03a9 , C\u03a9 ).\nProof. Assume that X does not satisfy Split(C\u03a9 , C\u03a9 ), and let Y \u2286 [N]\u05d00\nbe a continuous image of X which is a subbase for an ultrafilter. Note\nthat all finite powers of Y satisfy Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ). For each k, define\n\u03a8k : Y k \u2192 [N]\u05d00 by\n(a1 , . . . , ak ) 7\u2192 a1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 ak\nfor each a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 Y . \u03a8k is continuous, and therefore its image\nsatS\nisfies Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ). As Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ) is \u03c3-additive [20], Z = k \u03a8k [Y k ]\nsatisfies Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ), and Z is a base for an ultrafilter \u2013 a contradiction.\n\u0003\n3. When semifilter trichotomy holds\nThe second part of the following theorem was proved in [25], using\nmuch more complicated arguments.\nTheorem 3.1. Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then\nUfin (O, \u0393) = Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ).\nIn particular, Ufin (O, \u0393) = Split(\u039b, \u039b).\nProof. By Theorem 2.1, it suffices to prove that every space X satisfying Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ), satisfies Ufin (O, \u0393).\nIndeed, assume that a continuous image Y \u2286 [N]\u05d00 of X is unbounded. By Lemma 1.8, there is an increasing h \u2208 NN such that\nY /h (a continuous image of Y , and therefore of X) is reaping. Thus,\nX does not satisfy Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ).\nFor the last assertion of the theorem, use Scheepers' result that\nUfin (O, \u0393) implies Split(\u039b, \u039b) [17], and the trivial fact that Split(\u039b, \u039b)\nimplies Split(C\u039b , C\u039b ).\n\u0003\n\n\fCOMBINATORIAL IMAGES AND SEMIFILTER TRICHOTOMY\n\n7\n\nThe following natural concept, due to Ko\u010dinac and Scheepers [11],\nwill appear several times in this paper. We introduce it using the selfexplanatory terminology of [16].\nDefinition 3.2. A cover U of X is \u03b3-glueable if U can be partitioned\ninto infinitely many finite pieces, such that either each piece covers X,\nor else the unions of the pieces form a \u03b3-cover of X. \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393) is the family\nof all open \u03b3-glueable covers of X.\nThe Gerlits-Nagy property (\u2217) is defined in [9]. In [11] it is shown\nthat this property is equivalent to S1 (\u039b, \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)).\nCorollary 3.3. Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then\nS1 (\u039b, \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)) = S1 (O, O).\nProof. S1 (\u039b, \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)) = Ufin (O, \u0393) \u2229 S1 (O, O) [11]. Apply Theorems 2.2\nand 3.1.\n\u0003\nA classical problem of Hurewicz asks whether Ufin (O, \u0393) 6= Sfin (O, O).\nChaber and Pol [7] gave a positive answer outright in ZFC (see [22]).\nHowever, we can show that a slightly stronger assertion is consistently\ntrue. The property Split(\u03a9, \u039b) is not very restrictive: E.g., it holds for\nevery analytic space [20].\nTheorem 3.4. Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then\nUfin (O, \u0393) = Sfin (O, O) \u2229 Split(C\u03a9 , C\u039b ).\nIn particular, Ufin (O, \u0393) = Sfin (O, O) \u2229 Split(\u03a9, \u039b).\n\n\u0003\n\nProof. Any base for [N]\u05d00 , when viewed as a subset of NN , is dominating. Thus, the proof is the same as in Theorem 3.1.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.5. Theorem 3.4 cannot be improved to get Ufin (O, \u0393) =\nSplit(\u03a9, \u039b) from semifilter trichotomy, since any analytic set (in particular, NN ) satisfies Split(\u03a9, \u039b) [20]. Moreover, some axiom is necessary\nto get the equality in Theorem 3.4, since even the stronger property\nS1 (\u03a9, \u03a9) does not imply Ufin (O, \u0393) [10].\nRemark 3.6. In [25], a space X is called almost Menger if for each large\nopen cover {Un : n \u2208 N} of X, setting Y = {{n : x \u2208 Un } : x \u2208 X} we\nhave that for each increasing h \u2208 NN , Y /h is not a base for [N]\u05d00 . It\nis shown there that if X satisfies Sfin (O, O) then X is almost Menger,\nand we are asked whether the converse holds. As a base for [N]\u05d00 must\nhave cardinality c, we have that the answer is negative when d < c.\nOn the other hand, the proof of Theorem 3.4 shows that assuming\nsemifilter trichotomy, if X is almost Menger and satisfies Split(\u03a9, \u039b),\nthen X satisfies Ufin (O, \u0393).\n\n\f8\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nWe now give a simple proof for the following result, which involves\nno splitting properties.\nTheorem 3.7 ([25]). Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then\nUfin (O, \u03a9) = Sfin (O, O).\nProof. Assume that X satisfies Sfin (O, O), and that Y \u2286 NN is a continuous image of X. We may assume that all elements in Y are increasing.\nY is not dominating. Choose an increasing g \u2208 NN witnessing that.\nThe collection Z of the sets [f \u2264 g] = {n : f (n) \u2264 g(n)}, f \u2208 Y , is a\ncontinuous image of Y in [N]\u05d00 . Thus, for each increasing h \u2208 NN , Z/h\nis not a base for [N]\u05d00 . By semifilter trichotomy, there is an increasing\nh \u2208 NN such that Z/h is a base for a filter F (F is either an ultrafilter\nor the Fr\u00e9chet filter). We will show that Y is bounded with respect to\nF.\nIndeed, define g\u0303 \u2208 NN by g\u0303(n) = g(h(n + 1)) for all n. For each\nf \u2208 Y , let a = [f \u2264 g]/h \u2208 F . For each n \u2208 a, choose k \u2208 [f \u2264\ng] \u2229 [h(n), h(n+1)). Then\nf (n) \u2264 f (h(n)) \u2264 f (k) \u2264 g(k) \u2264 g(h(n + 1)) = g\u0303(n).\nThus, a \u2286 [f \u2264 g\u0303]. As a \u2208 F , [f \u2264 g\u0303] \u2208 F . As F is a filter, g\u0303 witnesses\nthat Y is not finitely dominating.\n\u0003\nWe have thus obtained a simple proof for the following.\nCorollary 3.8 ([2]). Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then Ufin (O, \u03a9)\nis \u03c3-additive.\n\u0003\n4. Ufin (O, \u03a9) revisited\nNow that we know that consistently Ufin (O, \u03a9) = Sfin (O, O), we\ncan step back to ZFC and ask whether some nontrivial properties of\nSfin (O, O) can be transferred to Ufin (O, \u03a9). This is the purpose of this\nsection.\nIn [23] it is proved that if X satisfies Sfin (O, O), then for each continuous image Y of X in NN , the set\nG = {g \u2208 NN : (\u2200f \u2208 Y ) g 6\u2264\u2217 f }\nis nonmeager. In particular, this is true for Ufin (O, \u03a9), but this is not\nthe correct assertion for that property. For Y \u2286 NN , let\nmaxfin(Y ) = {max{f1 , . . . , fk } : k \u2208 N, f1 , . . . , fk \u2208 Y }.\nThen X satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9) if, and only if, for each continuous image\nY of X in NN , maxfin(Y ) is not dominating.\nTheorem 4.1. For each space X, the following are equivalent.\n\n\fCOMBINATORIAL IMAGES AND SEMIFILTER TRICHOTOMY\n\n9\n\n(1) X satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9).\n(2) For each continuous image Y of X in NN , the set\nG = {g \u2208 NN : (\u2200f \u2208 maxfin(Y )) g 6\u2264\u2217 f }\nis nonmeager.\nProof. (2 \u21d2 1) nonmeager sets are nonempty.\n(1 \u21d2 2) Assume that X satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9) and Y \u2286 NN is a continuous image of X. If Y is bounded, then (2) holds trivially. Assume\nthat Y is unbounded. Let g be a witness for the fact that Y is not\nfinitely dominating. Take\nZ = {[f < g] : f \u2208 Y }.\nZ is a subbase for a filter. Extend this filter to a nonprincipal ultrafilter\nF . For each f \u2208 Y , f \u2264F g. As F is a filter, \u2264F is transitive, so it\nsuffices to show that the set\nG\u2032 = {f \u2208 NN : g \u2264F f }\nis nonmeager. Since F is a nonmeager semifilter, this is true [22].\n(For an alternative approach see [23] and Lemma 2.4 of Mildenberger,\nShelah, and Tsaban [13].)\n\u0003\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 turned out easier than the corresponding\none for Sfin (O, O). However, for Sfin (O, O) we get slightly more: If X\nsatisfies Sfin (O, O), then for each continuous image Y of X in NN , the\nset\nG = {g \u2208 NN : (\u2203f \u2208 Y ) g \u2264\u2217 f }\nsatisfies Sfin (O, O) [23]. To see why this is indeed more, consider the\nfollowing.\nLemma 4.2. Assume that Y is a subset of NN and satisfies Sfin (O, O).\nThen Y is not comeager.\nProof. Assume that Y is comeager. To each f \u2208 NN , assign the set\naf = {f (0) + * * * + f (n) + n : n \u2208 N}.\nf 7\u2192 af is a homeomorphism from NN to [N]\u05d00 . Thus, Z = {af : f \u2208 Y }\nsatisfies Sfin (O, O) and is comeager. By a classical result of Talagrand\n[1], for each comeager subset Z of [N]\u05d00 there is an increasing h \u2208\nNN such that hZ/hi = [N]\u05d00 . It follows that Z/h is dominating \u2013 a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nThe following remains open.\n\n\f10\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nProblem 4.3. Assume that X satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9), and Y \u2286 NN is a\ncontinuous image of X. Does it follow that\nG = {g \u2208 NN : (\u2203k)(\u2203f1 , . . . , fk \u2208 Y ) g \u2264\u2217 max{f1 , . . . , fk }}\nsatisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9)?\nIn the remainder of this section we will show that the auxiliary results\nproved in [23] for Sfin (O, O), which are interesting in their own right,\nalso hold for Ufin (O, \u03a9).\nIt is consistent that Ufin (O, \u03a9) is not even preserved under taking\nfinite unions. In fact, this follows from the Continuum Hypothesis\n(or even just cov(M) = c) [2]. However, something is still provable\nabout unions of spaces satisfying Ufin (O, \u03a9). Let cov(Dfin ) denote the\nminimal cardinality of a partition of NN into families which are not\nfinitely dominating. This is the same as the minimal cardinality of a\npartition of any dominating family in NN into families which are not\nfinitely dominating. max{b, g} \u2264 cov(Dfin ), and it is consistent that\nstrict inequality holds [13].\nProposition 4.4. Assume that Z is a space, and I \u2286 P (Z) satisfies:\n(1) For each finite F \u2286 I, there is X \u2208 I such that \u222aF \u2286 X;\n(2) Each X \u2208 I satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9);\n(3) |I| < cov(Dfin ).\nThen \u222aI satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9).\nProof. Assume that \u03a8 : \u222aI \u2192 NN is continuous. By (2), for each\nX \u2208 I, \u03a8[X] is not finitely dominating, and therefore maxfin(\u03a8[X]) is\nnot finitely dominating. By (1),\n[\nmaxfin(\u03a8[\u222aI]) =\nmaxfin(\u03a8[X]).\nX\u2208I\n\nBy (3), maxfin(\u03a8[\u222aI]) is not dominating, that is, \u03a8[\u222aI] is not finitely\ndominating.\n\u0003\nAs Ufin (O, \u03a9) is hereditary for closed subsets, Proposition 4.4 implies\nthe following.\nCorollary 4.5.

Assume that X satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9) and K is \u03c3compact. Then X \u00d7 K satisfies Ufin (O, \u03a9).\nProof. By Corollary 4.6, we may assume that K is compact (one can\nalso manage without that). Assume that U1 , U2 , . . . , are countable open\nn\ncovers of X \u00d7 K.

All properties in the Scheepers diagram are hereditary\nfor closed subsets. As Ufin (O, \u0393), Sfin (O, O), S1 (\u0393, \u0393), S1 (\u0393, O), and\nS1 (O, O) are all \u03c3-additive [24], they are all hereditary for F\u03c3 subsets.\nGalvin and Miller [8] proved that S1 (\u03a9, \u0393) is also hereditary for F\u03c3\nsubsets. Sfin (\u03a9, \u03a9) is equivalent to satisfying Sfin (O, O) in all finite\npowers. As finite powers of F\u03c3 sets are F\u03c3 , Sfin (\u03a9, \u03a9) is also hereditary\nfor F\u03c3 subsets. Similarly, S1 (\u03a9, \u03a9) is equivalent to satisfying S1 (O, O)\nin all finite powers and is therefore also hereditary for F\u03c3 subsets. By\nCorollary 4.5, so is Ufin (O, \u03a9).\nProblem 4.9. Are Sfin (\u0393, \u03a9) and S1 (\u0393, \u03a9) hereditary for F\u03c3 subsets?\n5. The revised Hurewicz Problem for general spaces\nAs mentioned before, Theorem 3.4 may be considered a consistent\npositive solution to a revised version of the original Hurewicz Problem\n(which had a negative solution in ZFC).\nSince this result is new, we prove that it holds in general, i.e., without\nany assumption on the spaces.\nTheorem 5.1. Assume semifilter trichotomy. Then\nUfin (O, \u0393) = Sfin (O, O) \u2229 Split(\u03a9, \u039b)\nfor arbitrary topological spaces.\n\n\f12\n\nBOAZ TSABAN AND LYUBOMYR ZDOMSKYY\n\nProof. Assume that X satisfies Sfin (O, O) \u2229 Split(\u03a9, \u039b). By Sfin (O, O),\nwe have that X is Lindel\u00f6f. In [11] it is proved that Ufin (O, \u0393) =\nSfin (\u039b, \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)).1 As Sfin (O, O) = Sfin (\u039b, \u039b) [17, 10], we have that for\nLindel\u00f6f spaces,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u039b\n\u039b\n,\n= Sfin (O, O) \u2229\nUfin (O, \u0393) = Sfin (\u039b, \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)) = Sfin (\u039b, \u039b) \u2229\n\u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)\n\u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)\n\u0001\n\u039b\nwhere \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)\nmeans that every element of \u039b contains an element of \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393).\nIt therefore remains to prove this latter property.\nLet U be a large open cover of X. As X satisfies Sfin (\u039b, \u039b), we may\nassume that U is countable and fix a bijective enumeration U = {Un :\nn \u2208 N}. Let\nY = {{n : x \u2208 Un } : x \u2208 X}.\nChoose an increasing h \u2208 NN witnessing semifilter trichotomy for hY i.\nFor each n, define\n[\nVn =\nUk .\nk\u2208[h(n),h(n+1))\n\nCase 1. There are infinitely many n such that Vn = X. Let a \u2208 [N]\u05d00\nbe the set of all these n. Taking g(0) = 0 and g(n) = h(a(n \u2212 1)) for\nn > 0, we have that the sets Fn = {Uk : k \u2208 [g(n), g(n+1))}, n \u2208 N,\nform a partition of U showing that it is \u03b3-glueable.\nCase 2. There are only finitely many n such that Vn = X. Removing\nfinitely many elements from U, we may assume that there are no such n.\n(We can add these elements later to one of the pieces of the partition).\nAssume that Y /h is a base for an ultrafilter. Then for each finite\na1 , . . . , ak \u2208 X, there is n \u2208 a1 /h \u2229 . . . ak /h, that is, a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 Vn .\nThus, V = {Vn : n \u2208 N} is an open \u03c9-cover of X. As Y /h is reaping, V\ncannot be split into two large covers of X. This contradicts Split(\u03a9, \u039b).\nAs Y satisfies Sfin (O, O), Y /h is not a base for [N]\u05d00 [25].\nIf follows that all elements in Y /h are cofinite, that is, for each\nx \u2208 X and all but finitely many n, x \u2208 Vn . This shows that U is\n\u03b3-glueable.\n\u0003\nIt is not always the case that theorems of the discussed sort can\nbe transferred from sets of reals to arbitrary spaces. We conclude the\npaper with an example for that.\n\u0001\n\u039b\nIt is known that for sets of reals, Ufin (O, \u0393) = \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)\n[21]. Had we\nbeen able to prove this for general topological spaces, this would have\n1The\n\nproof in [11] only requires that X is Lindel\u00f6f.\n\n\fCOMBINATORIAL IMAGES AND SEMIFILTER TRICHOTOMY\n\n13\n\nmade the last proof shorter. Unfortunately, this can be refuted in a\nstrong sense.\nProposition\n\u0001 5.2. There exists a hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f T1 space S sat\u039b\nisfying \u202b(\u05d2\u202c\u0393)\n, but not even Sfin (O, O).\n\nProof. Consider the topology \u03c4 on N generated by the sets {[0, n) :\nn \u2208 N}. \u03c4 gives a product topology \u03bd on NN . (NN , \u03bd) does not satisfy\nn\nSfin (O, O): Indeed, consider the open covers Un = {Um\n: m \u2208 N} with\nn\nN\nUm = {f \u2208 N : f (n) \u2264 m}.\nLet \u03bc be the topology generated by {U \\ A : U \u2208 \u03bd, A \u2286 NN is finite}\nas a base, and take S = (NN , \u03bc). Clearly, S is T1 . As \u03bd \u2286 \u03bc, S does not\nsatisfy Sfin (O, O). As \u03bc is contained in the standard product topology\non NN , S is hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f.\nAssume that U \u2286 \u03bc is a large cover of NN . As (NN , \u03bc) is hereditarily\nLindel\u00f6f, we may assume that U is countable [20], and enumerate it\nbijectively as U = {Un \\Fn : nS\u2208 N}, where each Un \u2208 \u03bd and each Fn is a\nfinite subset of NN . Let D = n Fn . For a sequence F = {Xn : n \u2208 N},\nand f \u2208 NN , write fF = {n : f \u2208 Xn }.\nFor each finite F \u2286 NN let g = max F . Let n be such that g \u2208 Un \\Fn .\nThen F \u2286 Un . It follows that V = {Un : n \u2208 N} is an \u03c9-cover of NN\nby sets open in the standard topology on NN . Consequently, V is a \u03b3glueable cover of NN (Sakai [15]). Then {fV : f \u2208 NN \\ D} is bounded.\nNote that for each f 6\u2208 D, fV = fU , and therefore {fU : f \u2208 NN \\ D}\nis bounded. As D is countable, {fU : f \u2208 D} is also bounded, and\ntherefore {fU : f \u2208 NN } is bounded, that is, U is \u03b3-glueable.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] T. Banakh and L.
