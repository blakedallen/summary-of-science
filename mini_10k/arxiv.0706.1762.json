Possible deviations from linearity of the LMC Cepheid PL and PLC relations are\ninvestigated. Two datasets are studied, respectively from the OGLE and MACHO projects. A\nnonparametric test, based on linear regression residuals, suggests that neither PL relation is linear. If\ncolour dependence is allowed for then the MACHO PL relation is found to deviate more significantly\nfrom the linear, while the OGLE PL relation is consistent with linearity. These finding are confirmed\nby fitting \"Generalised Additive Models\" (nonparametric regression functions) to the two datasets.\nColour dependence is shown to be nonlinear in both datasets, distinctly so in the case of the MACHO\nCepheids. It is also shown that there is interaction between the period and colour functions in the\nMACHO data.\n\nKey words: methods: statistical - stars: variables: Cepheids - cosmology: distance scale\n\n\f1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCepheids are important objects in Astrophysics, both because of their use in the extra-galactic distance scale\nand their role in stellar evolution. Their regularly repeating light curves offer an important opportunity to test\ntheories of stellar evolution against stellar pulsation: mass-luminosity (ML) relations mandated from evolutionary calculations can be used as input to full linear and non-linear hydrodynamic models of Cepheids and\ncompared to observations. These ML relations contain input about evolutionary physics such as the amount\nof convective overshoot. Constraining theoretical models with observations can be used to gain considerable\ninsight into evolutionary/pulsation physics. On the other hand the Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relation\nhas played an important role in establishing the extra-galactic distance scale and the subsequent estimation of\nHubble's constant, H0 . The HST Key Project (Freedman et al. 2001) has used HST observations of Cepheids\nin a number of galaxies to estimate H0 to within 10% accuracy. The crucial step in this work has been the\nCepheid PL relation in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which has been used to characterize a Cepheid PL\nrelation template. This PL template has traditionally been thought to be linear, however there has also been\nrecent work implying a variation of the slope with period in the LMC (Tammann & Reindl 2002; Kanbur &\nNgeow 2004, 2006; Sandage et al. 2004; Kanbur et al. 2007a; Ngeow et al. 2005; Ngeow & Kanbur 2006a,b).\nNgeow and Kanbur (2006c) estimate the error in estimating H0 , if a linear Cepheid PL relation is assumed\nand the underlying relation is \"non-linear\" at a period of 10 days, and find this can lead to an error of about\n1 \u2212 2%. Such an error seems small but with significant work being carried out to reduce zero point errors (Macri\net al 2006), it is important to construct as accurate a distance scale as possible that is independent of the CMB.\nFurther, table 2 of Spergel et al (2007) points to the fact that an independent estimate of H0 , accurate to less\nthan 5%, will help to break the degeneracy between \u03a9matter and H0 present from WMAP CMB studies. An\nindependent estimate of H0 accurate to 1% will result in a reduction of the 65% confidence interval on \u03a9matter\nby almost a factor of two over that with WMAP data alone.\nIn previous studies, a rigorous statistical test, the F test, was applied to the LMC Cepheids to test for the\nlinear versus non-linear PL relation. Here by \"non-linear\" we mean two lines of significantly differing slope\nwhich are continuous at a period of 10 days. The F test results that were obtained from the OGLE (Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment, Udalski et al. 1999) and MACHO Cepheid data, in Kanbur & Ngeow (2004;\n2006) and Ngeow et al. (2005) respectively, strongly imply that the LMC PC/PL relations are non-linear. It\nis important to note that several other statistical tests, such as the \u03c72 tests, least absolute deviation, robust\nestimation and loess procedures, were also applied to the MACHO data, and these results also point to a nonlinear LMC PL relation (Ngeow et al. 2005). Recently, Kanbur et al (2007a) developed the use of testimators\nand a likelihood based method using the Schwarz Information Criterion, to study non-linearities in the LMC\nPL relation (using both OGLE and MACHO Cepheid data) and again came to the same conclusion: the LMC\nCepheid PL relation is non-linear in the sense described above. The F test also suggested that the LMC\nperiod-colour (PC) relation is non-linear, in contrast to the Galactic and SMC (Small Magellanic Cloud) PC\nrelations (Kanbur & Ngeow 2004). Since the question of the non-linearity of the LMC PL relation is important\nin distance scale and stellar studies, it is vital to establish this as firmly as possible; this is one of the motivations\nfor this paper.\nIn addition to investigating the non-linearity of the LMC PL relation, we also study the LMC periodluminosity-colour (PLC) relation. A number of authors, including Sandage (1958) and Madore and Freedman\n(1991) have derived the Period-Luminosity-Color (PLC) relation and shown how it arises from the period-mean\ndensity theorem, the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the existence of an instability strip. These authors also point\nout that the PL/PC relations are obtained from the PLC relation by averaging over the variable not included\nin the relation.\nIn Section 2, we briefly describe the data used in our study. In Section 3 we apply a preliminary test study on\nthe LMC PL relation. This is followed by more detailed analysis in Section 4, based on a non-parametric model\n\n1\n\n\ffitting procedure. An extension to the PLC relation is presented in Section 5. The conclusion and discussion of\nour results are given in Section 6.\nWe add a few sentences on the use of non-parametric methods in what follows. The term \"non-parametric\"\nis actually used in three slightly different senses. First, the major innovation (sections 4 and 5) in this paper\nis the use of \"non-parametric regression\". The meaning is not necessarily the usual one of \"distribution-free\":\nrather, it means that the form of the regression is not specified \u2013 the regression function is \"unstructured\",\nbeing dictated by the data itself. Of course, this flexibility allows one to detect subtleties which may otherwise\nbe overlooked. Second, in the next section of the paper we use a well-known distribution-free statistic, the\n\"Wald-Wolfowitz runs test\". This non-parametric statistic uses only data ranks, and hence typically not very\npowerful. Third, also in the next section use is made of a permutation method. This avoids distributional\nassumptions about the data, by using re-orderings of the data itself to establish significance levels.\n\n2\n\nTHE DATA\n\nWe use two sets of LMC Cepheid data in our study. The first data set is the extinction corrected V -band mean\nmagnitudes and (V \u2212I) colours for the OGLE LMC Cepheids taken from Kanbur & Ngeow (2006), supplemented\nwith additional Cepheids from Sebo et al (2002), and referred as \"OGLE\" data in this paper. The second data\nset is the MACHO Cepheids data, with extinction corrected V mean magnitudes and (V \u2212 R) colours, adopted\nfrom Ngeow et al (2005). Using these two data sets allow us to compare the results, particularly for the different\nphotometric filters used.\nA possible complication is that any apparent non-linearity in PL or PLC relations could be caused by\nextinction errors which are a function of colour or period. Arguments against extinction errors as a cause of\nobserved non-linear LMC PL and PC relations were presented in Kanbur & Ngeow (2004), Kanbur & Ngeow\n(2006), Kanbur et al. (2007b), Ngeow et al. (2005), Ngeow & Kanbur (2006b) and Sandage et al. (2004), and\nwill therfore not be repeated in detail here. In particular, a possible period dependency of extinction errors has\nbeen investigated in Ngeow & Kanbur (2006b). If such extinction errors were present, then the PC relations at\nmaximum light would be such that LMC Cepheids would get hotter at maximum light as the pulsation period\nincreases: a fact which would be hard to reconcile with pulsation theory especially as Galactic Cepheids, in\ncommon with LMC Cepheids, display a flat PC relation at maximum light (Kanbur & Ngeow 2004, 2006).\nFurther, the dependence of extinction error on colour would need to be very complicated to explain both the\nnon-linearity at mean light whilst preserving the flatness at maximum light.\nIt is also noted that the reddening values adopted here are the same as those used in many distance scale\nstudies (Freedman et al. 2001).\n\n3\n\nA PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION BASED ON A TEST PROCEDURE\n\nFigs. 1 and 2 show the MACHO and OGLE PL data, with least squares linear fits of the form\nV = a + b log P + error .\n\n(1)\n\nFor the sake of completeness,\nV\nV\n\n=\n=\n\n17.08(0.026) \u2212 2.70(0.039) log P\n17.05(0.020) \u2212 2.69(0.028) log P\n\n2\n\n(M ACHO)\n(OGLE)\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere standard errors of coefficient estimates are given in brackets. Although both fits are excellent, it is\nnonetheless of some interest whether there may be subtle deviations from the strictly linear relations between\nV and log P shown by the lines: although this may have little importance for prediction of luminosity given the\nperiod, it could (e.g.) have an important bearing on the modelling of Cepheid pulsations.\nA simple procedure which provides some insight into the problem is to study partial sums of the residuals\nof the least squares fits. First arrange the data so that the period values are in ascending order:\nP1 < P2 < P3 < . . . < PN\nwhere N is the sample size. Then\nC(j) =\n\nj\nX\n\n[Vk \u2212 a \u2212 b log Pk ] =\n\nj\nX\n\nrk\n\n(3)\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nare the partial sums of the residuals rk . If there are no deviations from linearity, then C(j) is the sum of\nuncorrelated random numbers and hence a simple random walk. However, if there are deviations from linearity\nsuccessive residuals may be correlated, and hence C(j) will not be a simple random walk. Partials sums of the\nrk can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4.\nA statistic which can be used for testing whether the partial sum is a pure random walk is its vertical range\nR = max C(j) \u2212 min C(j) :\nj\n\nj\n\nthis may be expected to be inflated by positively correlated residuals. Significance levels for the values of R are\nreadily obtained by permutation, as follows:\n(i) Permute the rk ; this will randomise the residuals by destroying any possible trends.\n(ii) The partial sums of the permuted rk will be true random walks \u2013 find the statistic R for the permutation.\n(iii) Repeat steps (i) and (ii) a large number of times, noting the values of R.\n(iv) Determine the fraction of permutation R-values which exceeds the observed value \u2013 this estimates the\nsignificance level of the observed R.\nApplying 10000 permutations, significance levels of 3% and 4% were obtained for the MACHO and OGLE data\nrespectively, suggesting meaningful deviation of the observed rk from randomness. The implication is therefore\nthat the PL relation is not perfectly linear.\nStudy of Figs. 3 and 4 shows that there is an excess of positive residuals for log P \u223c 0.5 and log P > 1, and\nan excess of negative values for 0.8 < log P < 1.\nInterestingly, application of the standard Wald-Wolfowitz runs test (e.g. Conover 1971) for randomness of\nthe residuals gives conflicting results for the two datasets \u2013 significance levels of 45% and 0.9% for the OGLE\nand MACHO data respectively. Of course, the procedure uses only the signs, and not the sizes, of the rk .\nIt is known that Cepheids follow a PLC, rather than simply a PL, relation. It may therefore be prudent to\nreplace (1) by\nj\nX\n[Vk \u2212 a \u2212 b log Pk \u2212 c(CI)k ]\n(4)\nC(j) =\nk=1\n\nwhere (CI) indicates a colour index, with regression coefficient c. This has a substantial influence on the\nsignificance levels of the statistic R: for the OGLE data is increases to 33%, while the level for the MACHO\ndata is reduced to 0.7%. The corresponding Wald-Wolfowitz test levels are 43% and 1.5%.\nTo summarise, there is strong evidence of non-randomness in the residuals of the MACHO data, both for\nthe PL and the PLC relations. For the OGLE data the results are ambiguous.\n3\n\n\f4\n\nPL RELATION\n\nAn alternative to the imposition of a fully specified parametric model such as (1) is to allow the form of the\nregression to be dictated by the data. The idea is conveniently illustrated by a technique known as \"loess\" (see\ne.g. Cleveland & Devlin 1988). Ngeow et al (2005) initially used this method on MACHO data and found a\nsimilar result to that reported here. Here we study it in more detail and apply it to both MACHO and OGLE\nCepheid data. The method entails fitting a low order polynomial (in the present case a straight line) over\nrestricted sections (\"windows\") of the data by weighted least squares. In the implementation here the only free\nparameter is the width \u03b1 of the window, which is usually given as a fraction of the range of the independent\nvariable (i.e. 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1) . The smaller \u03b1 the more \"local\" the estimated regression, and the more detail it\nshows. Fig. 5 shows a loess regression of the OGLE data, using \u03b1 = 0.05; if \u03b1 is increased towards unity the\nloess regression resembles the linear fit of Fig. 2.\nA key element is then obviously the choice of window width \u03b1, and it is desirable to use an objective method\nto find it. This is readily done by \"cross-validation\":\n(i) Choose a value of the window width \u03b1.\n(ii) Leave out the first datapoint and obtain a loess estimate Vb1 of the magnitude V1 by fitting the regression\nto the remaining data.\n(iii) Note the discrepancy\nbetween the true and predicted values.\n\n\u22061 = V1 \u2212 Vb1\n\n(iv) Repeat steps (ii)-(iii) for the second, third,..., last datapoints, giving the set \u22061 , \u22062 , . . . , \u2206N of discrepancies.\n(v) The value of the cross-validation criterion for the value of \u03b1 from (i) is the defined as\nCV (\u03b1) =\n\nN\nN\n1 X\n1 X 2\n\u2206j =\n(Vj \u2212 Vbj )2\nN j=1\nN j=1\n\n(5)\n\nClearly, it evaluates the predictive power over all the observations of the loess fit based on the particular\nvalue of \u03b1.\n(vi) Repeat steps (i)-(v) for all candidate values of \u03b1.\n(vii) The optimal \u03b1 is that which minimises CV (\u03b1).\nThe cross-validation functions for the two datasets are plotted in Fig. 6; optimal window widths are 0.36 and\n0.20 respectively for the MACHO and OGLE observations. In Figs. 7 and 8 the resultant loess functions are\ncompared to the regression lines from (1). A small difference between the curves over the approximate interval\n0.8 < log P < 1 is visible in both diagrams. There is also a substantial disagreement at the longest periods\nfor the MACHO results in Fig. 7: this is clearly due to the systematic difference between the data and the\nlinear regression line for log P > 1.25 (see Fig. 1). Similarly, the slight divergence between the loess and linear\nregression lines at the longest periods in Fig. 8, can be traced to the influence of the two OGLE datapoints\nwith log P > 1.7 (see Fig. 2).\nThe question arises as to whether the discrepancies between the loess curves and the straight line fits are\nat all meaningful. In order to address this issue confidence intervals for the loess curves are estimated by\n4\n\n\fbootstrapping (e.g. Efron & Tibshirani 1993). The results, based on 5000 bootstrap samples, are plotted in\nFigs. 9 and 10. Rather than showing the linear regression line and the 95lower limits, the difference between\nthe linear fit and the confidence limits are plotted, in order to more clearly display the deviations. It is notable\nthat the linear fits lie outside the confidence intervals for the loess functions for 0.8 < log P < 1 roughly. This\nsupports previous work which has suggested a \"break\" around a period log P \u2248 1 (Kanbur & Ngeow 2004,\nNgeow et al 2005, Kanbur et al 2007a).\nThe R software add-on package \"mcgv\" contains an alternative nonparametric regression facility in the form\nof thin plate regression splines (TPRS) (e.g. Wood 2006). The form of cross-validation used is based on a\nbalance between the sum of squared model residuals (which measures the goodness of the model fit) and a\nsmoothness term. Cross-validation in mcgv is automated.\nThe loess and TPRS results are compared for the MACHO and OGLE respectively in Figs. 11 and 12. The\nagreement is very good \u2013 in particular, the deviations from linearity for 0.8 < log P < 1 are also evident in\nthe TPRS results. Despite the fact that more effective degrees of freedom are required for the nonparametric\nfits (6.41 and 8.71 for the TPRS fits to the MACHO and OGLE data respectively) than for linear regression\n(3 degrees of freedom), the former fits follow the data considerably more closely. Model selection tools such as\nthe \"Akaike Information Criterion\" (AIC, e.g. Burnham & Anderson 2002) can be used to test whether the\nimproved model fit warrants the additional degrees of freedom expended. In this case, the TPRS fits are both\npreferred by very wide margins.\n\n5\n\nPLC RELATION\n\nUnusual datapoints can have substantial, often somewhat distorting, influences on regression surfaces. It is\ntherefore worthwhile examining the datasets carefully in order to identify such data. This is most easily done\nusing ordinary multiple linear least squares regression.\nFitting PLC relations to the two datasets give the results\nV\nV\n\n= 16.23(0.026) \u2212 3.30(0.029) log P + 3.95(0.093)(V \u2212 R)\n= 15.97(0.025) \u2212 3.23(0.018) log P + 2.30(0.049)(V \u2212 I)\n\n(M ACHO)\n(OGLE)\n\n(6)\n\nwith residual standard deviations 0.164 and 0.097 mag. Regression diagnostics were examined in order to\nidentify observations which gave rise to large residuals and/or were unduly influential on parameter estimates.\n\"Cooks's D\" statistic was used for the latter purpose \u2013 see e.g. Montgomery, Peck & Vining (2001) (or almost\nany other modern text devoted to linear regression theory). Three points were eliminated from the MACHO\ndata, and four from the OGLE data, on the basis of these diagnostics. The PLC relations were then re-estimated\nfor the reduced datasets, and the new sets of diagnostics examined. This led to a further two deletions from\nthe OGLE data. The final results, replacing (6), are\nV\n\n= 16.23(0.026) \u2212 3.32(0.029) log P + 4.00(0.092)(V \u2212 R)\n\n(M ACHO)\n\nV\n\n= 15.89(0.021) \u2212 3.29(0.015) log P + 2.48(0.041)(V \u2212 I)\n\n(OGLE)\n\n(7)\n\nwith residual standard deviations of 0.162 and 0.074 mag. The substantial reduction in residual variance, and\nlarge changes in regression coefficients for the OGLE results are particularly striking.\nIt is interesting to examine the positions of the rejected observations in three-dimensional dataplots. The\nplots in Figs. 11 and 12 were obtained by selecting perspectives which clearly show the positions of all questionable data. It is clear the observations for each dataset lie close to a plane, and that points with unsatisfactory\nregression diagnostics (marked by squares) all deviate from the plane. The fact that the plane in Fig. 12 (OGLE\ndata) is so well-defined explains why removal of the outlying points made such a substantial difference to the\n5\n\n\festimated coefficients. In the remainder of this paper we work with the reduced datasets (N = 1213, 717 for\nMACHO and OGLE data respectively). Note that one high-influence datum in the OGLE data is retained (for\nthe brightest Cepheid \u2013 see Fig. 12), since its associated residual is very small, and since its omission has very\nlittle influence on the values of the three estimated parameters.\nAn obvious extension of the linear PLC relation to the nonparametric case is the so-called \"Generalised\nAdditive Model\"\nV = \u03b1 + fP (log P ) + fC (CI) + error\n(8)\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant; CI denotes a colour index; and fP and fC are nonparametric regression functions such\nas loess or TPRS fits. Due to the several attractive features (automated cross-validation, to mention but one)\nthe R add-on package is once again used to perform TPRS fits of (8) to the data.\nThe results can be seen in Figs. 15 and 16. The estimated fP for the OGLE data is linear: the effective\ndegrees of freedom, 1.00, confirms this. By implication the model (8) reduces to\nV = \u03b1 + \u03b2 log P + fC (CI) + error .\n\n(9)\n\nNot surprisingly, the AICs of models (8) and (9) are exactly equal for the OGLE data.\nThe function fP for the MACHO data shows the familiar deviation from linearity in the range 0.8 < log P <\n1; this is more clearly demonstrated in Fig. 17, where a linear fit to fP has been subtracted.\nInspection of the fC functions in Fig. 16 shows that both are distinctly nonlinear.\nIt is of obvious interest to investigate why fP reduces to the perfectly linear form in the case of the OGLE\ndata, when the dependence of V on log P in the PL relation is nonlinear. Examining the relationship between\nlog P and the colour index (V \u2212 I) gives some insight into this question. The results of a loess regression of\n(V \u2212 I) on log P for the OGLE data are displayed in Fig. 18. The 95% confidence intervals, obtained from\n5000 bootstrap samples, are also shown. Calculations were done using a smoothing window of width 0.20, as\nindicated by cross-validation. The analogous plot for the MACHO data, based on a smoothing window width\nof 0.33, is in Fig. 19. In the case of the OGLE data there is a clear change in the relationship between log P\nand (V \u2212 I) in the neighbourhood 0.8 < log P < 1. It appears that small deviations from linearity in the P L\nrelation in Fig. 8 are compensated by the colour dependence. In the case of the MACHO data the kink in the\nP C plot (Fig. 19) is of similar size to that in Fig. 18, but the deviation from linearity in the P L plot is larger\n(Fig. 7). This may explain why the fP function remains nonlinear in the case of the MACHO P LC relation.\nThese results support similar work presented in Kanbur and Ngeow (2004) and Ngeow and Kanbur (2005) on\nthe non-linearity of the LMC PC relation using F tests, and on the linearity of the LMC Wessenheit function.\nNonparametric regression lends itself to much more flexible forms than ordinary multiple regression. Two\npossible alternatives to (8) are\nV = \u03b1 + fP (log P ) + fC (CI) + fP C (log P, CI) + error\n\n(10)\n\nV = \u03b1 + fP C (log P, CI) + error\n\n(11)\n\nand\nwhich allows for interaction between the two independent variables.\nThe two Generalized Additive Models (10) and (11) were also fitted to both datasets. For the OGLE data,\nthe AIC-preferred model is (10), but a more detailed analysis (ANOVA) shows that the contribution from the\ninteraction function fP C is not significant \u2013 hence the model effectively reduces to (8). For the MACHO data\nthe pure interaction model (11) is preferred, with (10) the second choice. According to the AIC, the additive\nmodel (8) is a very distant third choice. A contour plot of the fit of the model (11) can be seen in Fig. 20 \u2013\nthis demonstrates why (8) is inadequate. Of course, in practice (11) would be more tedious to work with than\nthe simpler additive form (8).\n6\n\n\fA few words of explanation of Fig. 20 may be in order. The form of a purely linear PLC relation would of\ncourse be\nV = a + b log P + cCI + error .\nOne way of displaying this graphically would be to draw the lines\nV = constant\nin the log P -CI plane, for various values of the constant. The equations describing these contour lines are\nCI = (V \u2212 b log P \u2212 constant)/c + error ,\ni.e. straight lines with slope \u2212b/c. Fig. 20, the equivalent for the non-parametric function fP C , shows not only\nthat the relations are nonlinear, but also that there is \"interaction\" \u2013 the form of the relation depends on the\nregion of the log P \u2013(V \u2212 R) plane it inhabits.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS & DISCUSSION\n\nIt should perhaps come as no surprise that with the acquisition of large amounts of new data finer detail in the\nrelationships between astrophysical observables are uncovered. The best-fitting models of the two datasets are\ngiven by (11) (MACHO) and (9) (OGLE) respectively, which both are both nonlinear.\nEstimates of the effect of such small non-linearities on the Cepheid distance scale and on Hubble's constant\nare given in Ngeow and Kanbur (2006c) and amount to 1 \u2212 2%. Such an error seems small but in the era of\n\"precision cosmology\" with a drive toward a distance scale accurate to 5%, such an effect is important. Perhaps\njust as important, a proper characterization of the precise detail in the observed phenomena will assist in placing\nimproved constraints on pulsation models of Cepheids and in particular on their ML relations, and hence on\ndetails of stellar evolutionary physics such as the amount of convective core overshoot.\nA possible physical explanation for this non-linearity is outlined in the papers by Kanbur et al. (2004),\nKanbur & Ngeow (2006) and Kanbur et al. (2007b), which studied Galactic, LMC and SMC Cepheid models\nrespectively. Briefly, these papers suggest the non-linearity is caused by the interaction of the hydrogen ionization\nfront (HIF) and photosphere and the way this interaction varies with period. At low densities, if the HIF\nand photosphere are engaged (i.e. the photosphere lies at the base of the HIF) then the temperature of the\nphotosphere and hence the colour of the star are almost independent of global stellar properties such as the\nperiod. Since the relative location of the photosphere and HIF varies with the L/M ratio, and since this varies\nwith period, modelling has implied that for LMC Cepheids with a period greater than 10 days, the photosphere\nand HIF are not engaged. Thus these stars have a different PC relation than their shorter period counterparts,\nBecause the PC and PL relations are really forms of the PLC relation, then a change in the PC relation results\nin a change in the PL relation. Galactic Cepheids are such that the HIF-photosphere interaction only really\noccurs at maximum light at low densities. LMC Cepheids are such that this HIF-photosphere interaction starts\nto occur at low densities only for Cepheids with periods greater than 10 days. SMC Cepheids are such that\nthis HIF-photosphere interaction always occurs at high densities (Kanbur et al. 2004; Kanbur & Ngeow 2006;\nKanbur et al. 2007b).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful for the efforts of those who have developed and maintained the R statistical software.\nSMK acknowledges support from a small research grant from the American Astronomical Society and the\nChretien International research grant.
