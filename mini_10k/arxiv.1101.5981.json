We\nargue that this offers potential for greater numerical stability.\n\n\u2020 Work partly supported by US DOE grant DE-FG02-09ER41600.\n\n\fWith the advent of the LHC, we enter the era of precision QCD, by which we mean\npredictions for QCD processes at the total precision tag of 1% or better. This is analogous to the per mille level era of EW corrections at LEP energies. Radiative effects\nat the level of O(\u03b1s2 ) have to be controlled on the QCD side and those at the level of\nO(\u03b1L\u03b1s ), O(\u03b12 L2 ) on the QED\u2297QCD and QED sides have to be controlled systematically, both from the physical precision standpoint and from the technical precision\nstandpoint, in order to optimize physics discovery at the LHC1 . In Ref. [1], we have developed a platform for the realization of such corrections ultimately on an event-by-event\nbasis based on exact, amplitude-based resummation of QED and QCD together, wherein\nresiduals for hard photons and hard gluons are simultaneously calculated order-by-order\nin perturbation theory in powers of \u03b1 and \u03b1s . These residuals, which are infrared finite\nand, for hadron-hadron applications, collinearly finite require then exact evaluation of\nhigher point and (higher) loop Feynman diagrams in an appropriate reduction scheme for\nany attendant tensor properties as first developed systematically in Ref. [2], for example.\nRecently, alternative approaches have been developed in Refs. [3,4] to deal with the growing complexity of the method in Ref. [2] as the number of legs beyond four and/or loops\nbeyond one increases. Here, we focus on higher point one-loop functions2 .\nIt has been demonstrated that n-point functions, for n = 1, * * * , 4, at one-loop, reduced to scalar functions using the method of Ref. [2], are tractable for fast MC event\ngenerator implementation for arbitrary masses and kinematics for high energy scattering\nprocesses [6\u201322]. It has also been demonstrated [23\u201326] that, at one-loop, higher point\nscalar functions can be reduced to sums of four-point scalar functions. In Refs. [24,27\u201330]\nrepresentations of the scalar four-point function that cover arbitrary masses and the momenta relevant to most high energy collider applications have been given and these are\nsuitable for fast MC implementation. Thus, when one is discussing higher point functions\nat one-loop, we can consider, at least for most collider physics applications, that the 1, 2,\n3 and 4 point functions at one-loop are known in a practical way so that the main issue\ncan be considered to be the representation of the higher point functions in terms of these\nknown functions.\nWhen we consider any higher point function, two of the most important aspects of\nany reduction procedure for recasting it in terms of the \"known\", lower point functions\nare its numerical stability and its usefulness for Monte Carlo event generator realization,\n\u02c6\nas we have in mind for our residuals \u03b2\u0304 \u0303 in Refs. [1] for example. Given the simplification\nn,m\n\nthat has been shown for the \"Chinese magic\" polarization scheme [31\u201333] for real emission\nof massless gauge particles in such functions, it is natural to seek further simplification\nand numerical stability in the virtual emission and re-absorption processes as well by\nexploiting the same scheme. It is this that we pursue in what follows.\nFor the reader unfamiliar with the \"Chinese magic\" polarization scheme for massless\n1\n\nHere, L denotes the typical big log for the process under discussion.\nSee Refs. [5] for some recent progress on the higher loop functions with an eye toward their use in\nthe MC realization of the approach in Ref. [1]\n2\n\n1\n\n\fgauge bosons, which is historically associated to the preprint in Ref. [31], the key observation is that the gauge invariance of the attendant massless gauge theory allows one to\nuse an attendant set of polarization vectors which, when the chiral forms of the respective\nspin 21 charged particles' wave functions are used, eliminate radiation from one entire side\nof a charged line and, simultaneously, simplify considerably the calculation of the part of\nthe amplitude that remains, almost like \"magic, hence the name. This is possible because\nof a representation of the respective polarization vector for helicity \u03bb\u03b3 and 4-momentum\nk\u03b3 , \u01eb\u03bc\u03bb\u03b3 , as a matrix element of the Dirac gamma matrix, \u03b3 \u03bc , between the spinor of helicity\n\u03bb\u03b3 and four-momentum k\u03b3 , |k\u03b3 \u03bb\u03b3 >, and the massless spinor state < \u03c1\u03bb\u03b3 |, \u03c12 = 0, up\nto a normalization factor, so that the Chisholm identity (see eq.(12) below) reduces the\nFeynman rule factor \u01eb\u2217\u03bc\n\u03bb\u03b3 \u03b3\u03bc at the respective interaction vertex to the simple expression\n2[|k\u03b3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 >< \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 | + |\u03c1\u03bb\u03b3 >< k\u03b3 \u03bb\u03b3 |], up to the same normalization factor, which causes\none side of a line of the real radiation terms to vanish if \u03c1 is set equal to the external\n4-momentum entering(leaving) that side of the respective line. The remaining terms are\nthen expressed in terms of simple spinor products which lend themselves to easy evaluation [31\u201333]. This gives a 'magically' shortened expression compared the usual Cartesian\nrepresentation of the polarization vector with the squared amplitude modulus evaluated\nusing traces over the fermion lines. We illustrate this below here as well.\nSpecifically, we will use the conventions of Ref. [10, 34] for spinors and polarization\nvectors, which are derived from the work of [31, 33]. The 5-pt function which we want to\nanalyze in these conventions as our prototypical example is shown in diagram (c) in Fig. 1.\nIt has many applications in collider precision physics. When combined with diagrams 1(a)\nand 1(b) it generates a gauge invariant contribution to the ISR for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 f f \u0304+\u03b3, f 6= e 3 ,\nfor example, and it is a part of such a contribution to u\u016b \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u0304 + G (in an appropriate\ncolor basis), etc. Such applications and their attendant phenomenology will be taken up\nelsewhere. [36]. Here, we focus on the use of Chinese magic in the loop integral in Fig.\n1(c) to illustrate what simplifications are possible.\nMore precisely, by the standard methods, we need the following Feynman integral\nrepresentation of Fig. 1(c)\n(1c)\nM\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u03b3\n1 2\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u2217\nd4 q v\u0304\u03bb2 \u03b3 (6 q+ 6 p1 \u2212 6 k + m1 ) 6 \u01eb\u03bb\u03b3 (6 q+ 6 p1 + m1 )\u03b3 u\u03bb1\n= (2\u03c0) \u03b4(p1 + p2 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 k)C\n(2\u03c0)4 ((q + p1 \u2212 k)2 \u2212 m21 + i\u01eb)((q + p1 )2 \u2212 m21 + i\u01eb)\n\u016b\u2032\u03bb\u2032 \u03b3\u03b1 (6 q+ 6 p\u20321 + m2 )\u03b3\u03b2 v\u03bb\u2032 \u2032\n2\n1\n+ ...,\n((q + p1 + p2 \u2212 k)2 \u2212 MV22 + i\u01eb)((q + p\u20321 )2 \u2212 m22 + i\u01eb)(q 2 \u2212 MV21 + i\u01eb)\n(1)\n4\n\np\u20321\n\np\u20322\n\nR\n\nwhere we have defined massless limit coupling factor\nC = C({\u03bbi }, {\u03bb\u2032j }) = Q1 eG2 G\u20322 (v1\u2032 + a\u20321 \u03bb2 )(v1 \u2212 a1 \u03bb1 )(v2\u2032 + a\u20322 \u03bb\u20322 )(v2 \u2212 a2 \u03bb\u20321 )\n\n(2)\n\nwith the couplings Q1 e, G and G\u2032 for the \u03b3, V1 and V2 , respectively.

We take the the basis of the\n4-dimensional momentum space as follows:\nl1 = (E, E \u1e91), l2 = (E, \u2212E \u1e91)\n< l2 + |\u03b3 \u03bc |l1 + >\nl3 = E \u221a\n2 < l2 \u2212 |l1 + >\n\u2212E\n= \u221a (x\u0302 + i\u0177)\n2\n< l2 \u2212 |\u03b3 \u03bc |l1 \u2212 >\nl4 = E \u221a\n2 < l2 + |l1 \u2212 >\nE\n= \u221a (x\u0302 \u2212 i\u0177)\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we use the obvious equivalence |l\u03c3 >= u(l)\u03c3 in the notation of Refs. [31\u201334]. The\nimportant point is that all four of these basis 4-vectors are light-like with l2i = 0, i =\n1, * * * , 4.They therefore can participate in Chinese magic.\nTo illustrate explicitly this latter point, consider the definite case \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb\u20321 , \u03bb\u20322 , \u03bb\u03b3 =\n+, \u2212, +, \u2212, +, as all other choices for the helicities behave similarly. We write the loop\nmomentum as\nq = \u03b1i l i\n(6)\nwith summation over repeated indices understood.

Note that the 'magic' has killed all but one set of the\nterms with three factors of the virtual momentum expansion coefficients and that, in\nthe numerator of the propagator (before)after the real emission vertex, it has eliminated\nthe terms associated with (6 p1 )6 k as well as half of the terms in the respective virtual\nmomentum expansion in former case. While we have eliminated a large fraction of the\npossible terms on the RHS of (13), one can ask how it compares in length with what one\nwould get from the usual approaches of taking traces on the fermion lines. To be specific,\nin the traditional method that leads to traces on fermion lines, one needs to compare the\nlength of 2RM\u2217B M(1c) where MB is the respective Born amplitude that would interfere\nwith the one-loop amplitude to create the one-loop correction to the respective cross\nsection. In the Chinese magic representation, we get immediately that only radiation\nfrom the anti-particle (p2 ) incoming line contributes with the simple result (repeated\nindices are summed and s\u2032 = (p1 + p2 \u2212 k)2 as usual)\n4\n\nMB +\u2212+\u2212+ = (2\u03c0) \u03b4(p1 + p2 \u2212\n\np\u20321\n\n\u2212\n\np\u20322\n\n\u2212 k)\n\n\u221a\n2 2ieQ1 G2j (vj\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032j )(vj \u2212 aj ) < p\u20322 \u2212 |p1 + >\n\n< k \u2212 |p1 + >< k \u2212 |p2 + > (s\u2032 \u2212 MV2j + i\u01eb)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n< p1 \u2212 |p2 + >< p2 + |p\u20321 \u2212 > \u2212 < p1 \u2212 |k+ >< k + |p\u20321 \u2212 >\n\n(15)\n\nso that computing 2RM\u2217B M(1c) just involves multiplying N in (13) by the complex\nconjugate of this simple expression and taking twice the real part. If we proceed with the\nusual trace on the fermion lines method, one needs the trace of two sets of terms with 10\nDirac gamma matrices multiplied by a factor with the trace of 6 Dirac gamma matrices:\nthis means one has 2 * 9 * 7 * 5 * 4\u00d75 * 4 = 2520 \u00d7 20 = 50, 400 terms, each of which requires\nPassarino-Veltman reduction of 3, 2, and 1 5-pt tensor integrals. In Ref. [38], another\napproach that leads as well to traces over fermions is used in which one first expands the\namplitude under study in a gauge invariant tensor basis with scalar coefficients and uses\nChinese magic-type [31\u201333] representations of the helicity states to express the attendant\nhelicity amplitudes in terms of these invariant scalar coefficient functions. The key step\nis the use of projection operators, P(X) in the notation of Ref. [38], which project out\n7\n\n\fthe scalar coefficient X. To compare with our approach, we observe the following: the\nBorn amplitude tensor structure is one of the tensor structures in the respective expansion\nbasis and to project its coefficient the respective projection operator evaluates a linear\ncombination of the trace on the fermion lines of the hermitian conjugate of this Born level\ntensor structure in product with the Feynman amplitude and the traces on the fermion\nlines of the hermitian conjugates of the other tensor structures in product with the same\namplitude. Thus, our counting of terms given for the evaluation of 2RM\u2217B M(1c) using\nthe traditional traces on fermion lines gives a lower limit to the number of terms that\nwould be generated by the methods of Ref. [38] for our calculation4 . Looked at this way,\nwe can appreciate better the great simplification that (13) represents. It follows that this\nform of N in (13) has efficiently reduced the problem of reduction of the 5-pt function\nwith three, two and one tensor indices(index) in the Passarino-Veltman formalism to the\nproblem of a single scalar 5-pt function and lower 4, 3 and 2 point functions with the\ncoefficients already explicitly expressed in terms of the cms kinematic variables that are\nso crucial to efficient MC event generation. Efficient MC event generator realization of\nthe latter functions is known [6\u201322], where it is understood that one uses the results in\nRef. [23\u201326] to express the scalar 5-pt function in terms of scalar 4-pt functions using our\nexplicit kinematics above. These last remarks are made more manifest when one notes\nthe introduction of the result for N in (13) into the integral in (1) leads to the integrals\nR 4\nd q Di Dj Dk ; Di Dj ; Dj ; 1\n, i, j, k = 0, * * * , 4\n(16)\n(2\u03c0)4\nD0 D1 D2 D3 D4\nall of which are known from the lower point functions we advertised when the results for the\nrepresentation of the scalar 5-point function in terms of 4-point functions in Refs. [24\u201326]\nare used5 . We get a bonus: no evaluation of wave functions at complex momenta is\nrequired here. What we have done is rigorously a result of Lagrangian quantum field\ntheory and it therefore can serve as a cross check on methods that may not obviously so\nbe. Evidently, the method we have illustrated can be used for any higher point function.\n4\n\nFor example, let us take the example discussed in Ref. [38], using their notation, of\nq(p2 , \u03bb2 ) q\u0304(p1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2192 \u03b3(p3 , \u03bb3 ) \u03b3(p4 , \u03bb4 ), where we focus just on the one-loop correction from the GrossWilczek-Politzer [39] QCD theory with direct analysis for the respective 4-pt box graph in which a\ngluon is exchanged between the incoming quark(q) anti-quark(q\u0304) pair \"before\" they annihilate to the\ntwo photons. For the helicities + \u2212 ++ for the quark, anti-quark, \u03b3(p3 ), \u03b3(p4 ), respectively, the helicity\namplitude is proportional to the A11 scalar coefficient in Ref. [38]. Evaluation of the projection operator\nfor A11 on the box graph requires the trace for a product of 12 Dirac gamma matrices, which generates\n11 * 9 * 7 * 5 * 3 = 10, 395 terms, and this has to be done 5 times (there are five scalar coefficients) for a\ntotal of 51, 975 terms. This is just a 4-pt function. The same calculation using our methods generates a\nformula smaller in length than that in eq.(20) in the text.\n5\nSince the integral in (1) is manifestly UV finite, we do not need to specify what regularization is\nused for the two point functions because only UV finite combinations of them can occur here while the\nwave functions are all in 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Note also that the standard trace over fermion\nlines would also lead to results equivalent to that in (16) but as we have seen above it would necessitate\nevaluation and simplification of much longer expressions in general to compute the attendant transition\nrate for the process.\n\n8\n\n\fAt this point, while we have shortened considerably the respective amplitude and\nhave removed the Gram determinant type factors in the tensor reductions, we are still\nsubject to the Gram determinant-type denominator factors in the results in Refs. [24\u201326]\nfor the representation of the 5-point scalar function in terms of 4-point scalar functions.\nWe have found that these are in general still too numerically unstable for realization in the\namplitude-based exact resummation MC event generators such as those in Refs.

The\ncomplete phenomenology of our results for the process in Fig. 1 will appear elsewhere [36].\nIt is important to explain the difference between what we have done here and what was\ndone in Refs. [3, 4, 40, 41]. We do this in turn in a somewhat reverse chronological order.\nIn Ref. [40], the representation of the loop variable in a basis of light-like 4-vectors is used\nto construct a recursion relation between one-loop n-point tensor integrals of differing\nrank whereas in Ref. [41] the spinor representation of the external tensor coefficient of\na massless n-point tensor one-loop integral is used to reduce the rank of that integral\niteratively to allow numerical implementation, using Dirac matrix methods. In both cases,\nthe square roots of the Gram determinants appear in the denominators of the resulting\nrepresentations. In our approach, explicit kinematics allows direct Chinese magic action\nin the complete amplitude contribution's evaluation directly to the lower point functions\nwithout Gram determinant factors to be computed in our denominators. No iteration is\nnecessary and Chinese magic reduces considerably the number of terms in our final result.\nSuch action is not present in Refs. [40, 41]. In Refs. [4], the representation of the n-point\namplitude at one-loop starts from its integrand N(q)/(D0 * * * Dn\u22121 ) with an expansion of\nthe numerator N(q) in powers of the denominators {Dj } with coefficients that split into a\npart that is independent of q and a part that integrates to zero with the understanding that\nthe integration measure is in general in d dimensions whereas the function N(q) is defined\nfor q in 4-dimensions. We refer to this representation as the OPP representation after the\nauthors in the first paper in Refs. [4]. Various methods for adding in the so-called missing\nrational terms generated by the mismatch between the 4-dimensional q in N and the ddimensional q\u0304 in the {Dj } are given in Refs. [4], including the generalized d-dimensional\nunitarity that treats the full d-dimensional unitarity realization of the OPP representation.\nIn all of these works, N(q) or N(q\u0304) is treated as a given and no procedure for exploiting\nChinese magic to simply it at the loop momentum level is considered. Moreover, the need\nto add in rational terms is an essential part of the procedure, whereas, as we see in our\nresult (13), we do not have such an issue in our approach \u2013 we get the complete answer\nwith methods that operate entirely in 4-dimensions6 . More importantly, inverse powers\nof Gram-type determinants appear in the coefficients in the representation of N so that\nissues of numerical stability obtain, whereas as we show above our approach does not lead\nto such factors so that it should be more stable. Finally, the procedure for determining\nthe coefficients in the representation of N involves solving the algebraic problem for the q\nvalues at which 4 , then 3, then 2, and finally 1 of the {Dj } vanish(es). This means that,\nin general, complex values of q are required and this forces the evaluation of N(q) at such\nunphysical 4-momenta. Our approach avoids this issue altogether as we carry our entire\ncalculation out in the 4-dimensional real virtual loop momentum space. We then provide\n6\n\nIf one wants to apply our method to lower point amplitudes that are UV divergent, in renormalizable\ntheories one should use the known counter-terms for those divergences to render the amplitudes finite\nfirst and then apply our 4-dimensional methods to the UV finite subtracted amplitudes.\n\n11\n\n\fa completely physical cross check on the methods in Refs. [4]. Similarly, the approach\nin Refs. [3] also takes the integrand as a given and constructs the respective amplitude\nfrom unitarity-based on-shell (recursion) relations, where the authors in Refs. [3] are\nable to get both the cut-constructable and the rational parts of the amplitudes with\nsuch methods. Again, there is no exploitation of Chinese magic to simply the amplitude\nat the loop variable level, the amplitude construction uses 4-particle cuts that have in\ngeneral complex 4-momenta as their solutions so that wave functions are evaluated at\nsuch unphysical momenta, and the solution of these on-shell relations generally introduces\ntroublesome kinematic factors in the denominators of the representation so that numerical\nstability cannot be assured. Our approach avoids all of these problems and affords again\na completely physical cross check on this approach as well.\nThe complete analytical result for the amplitude in Fig. 1 will be presented elsewhere [36]. Here, we have shown that the use of Chinese magic in the virtual loop\nmomentum can reduce considerably the amount of algebra required for stable, efficient,\nmanifestly physical computation of higher point virtual corrections with general mass\nscales, as they are needed for exact amplitude-based resummed MC event generator realization.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Prof. S.
