One reason for an explosion of interest in this field\nis the discovery of carbon nanotubes, which are quasi-one dimensional (1D).\nA similar growth of research activity has focused on clusters, which are zerodimensional from the standpoint of statistical mechanics (because no length\ndiverges). A typical problem in these fields is the relation between properties\nin the reduced dimension and those in our 3D world. For example, the critical\ntemperature of the liquid-vapor transition Tc increases monotonically from\nzero to a value of order the pair interaction energy as D increases from 1 to 3\nor more. One might wonder, furthermore, about the evolution of behavior for\nsystems of variable effective dimensionality Def f , such as the fluid adsorbed\non a cylinder of varying radius. For very large (small) radius, Def f = 2 (1).\nIn this paper, we evaluate the binding energy of two particles, whose\nnuclei are constrained to move on a spherical surface of radius R. This is\nrelated to recent work exploring the evolution of films adsorbed on a C60\nbuckyball and similar substrates 1,2 . It is also related to an analogous study\nof dimer binding energy on a cylindrical surface 3 . That study found that\ndimers are very strongly bound if the cylinder's diameter is of order the\n\n\fM.K. Kostov, E.S. Hernandez and M.W. Cole\n\nhard-core diameter \u03c3 of the interacting particles 4 . In that situation, the\nbinding energy greatly exceeds that found in the 2D limit of infinite radius.\nThe reason for this large binding is the existence of a favorable phase space\ncondition at a particular ratio of R/\u03c3. We report here similar behavior in\nthe spherical case; that is, a particularly large binding energy EB occurs if\nan analogous geometrical condition is satisfied.\nWhile this paper focuses on EB for the dimer, experience with the analogous cylindrical surface problem suggests that properties of the many-body\nsystem will also exhibit extrema at a particular intermediate value of the\nratio R/\u03c3.3,5\n\n2.\n\nGROUND STATE ENERGIES AND WAVE FUNCTIONS\n\nOne may think of this geometry by imagining that one particle resides\nat a fixed position, the pole, r1 =(x,y,z)=(0,0,R) while the other particle\nmoves across the spherical surface in the presence of their interaction. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation uses the Hamiltonian:\n\"\n\n#\n\nh\u03042\n\u220722 + V (r) .\nH= \u2212\n2\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03bc is the interacting particles' reduced mass, \u220722 is the 2D Laplacian\n(variable polar and azimuthal angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6) and V(r) is taken as the\nusual Lennard-Jones(LJ) interaction with well-depth \u01eb. The coordinate r\nis the 3D separation: r=2R sin(\u03b8/2). In all cases studied here, we have\nassumed the LJ parameters: for the He isotopes, \u03c3=2.556 \u00c5 and \u01eb =10.22\nK, while for H2 -H2 the parameters are \u03c3 = 3.04 \u00c5 and \u01eb = 34.3 K. Then,\nEq. (1) can be reduced to a dimensionless form; the resulting equation\nprovides an implicit relation between the reduced binding energy E\u2217B =EB /\u01eb\nandh the ratioi R/\u03c3. This reduced equation involves a dimensionless quantity\nh/ \u03c3(\u03bc\u01eb)1/2 , related to the de Boer quantum parameter, discussed below;\nwhen this quantity is large, the reduced zero-point energy is large and the\nbinding energy is small.\nA useful function is the specific area a(r), defined as the area of the\nsphere lying within a distance interval [r, r+dr] from r1 , divided by dr. A\nsimple calculation yields the following result: a(r) = 2\u03c0r\u0398(2R \u2212 r), where\n\u0398(x) is the Heaviside unit step function. This result means that the most\nsurface area lies at distance from r1 nearly equal to 2R, but there exists no\nsurface at separation r>2R. To take optimal advantage of the attraction,\ntherefore, the potential minimum should lie at distance somewhat less than\n2R. One can prove the following consequence of this geometry: the classical\n\n\fBound state of dimers on a spherical surface\n\nFig. 1. Binding energies for the various He dimer problems as a function\nof sphere radius. The curves labeled \"var\" are variational results while the\nothers are exact.\nsecond virial coefficient of a fluid on this surface Bclass (T) has a maximum\nwhen R=\u03c3/2 and decreases monotonically with R if R> \u03c3/2. One might\ninvestigate whether similar behavior occurs in the quantum case. Then, the\nlow temperature behavior is dominated by the spectrum of bound states, if\nany are present.\nWe have determined the ground state energy (-EB ) for this problem in\ntwo ways, variational and exact, for a number of different systems, including\n3 He -3 He, 3 He -4 He and 4 He -4 He, as well as H -H . An interesting question\n2\n2\nis this: what ratio of R/\u03c3 gives the largest binding energy EB . Since no\nattraction is provided by the LJ potential unless R/\u03c3 >1/2, one might guess\nthat the largest binding occurs when R/\u03c3 \u223c1. Furthermore, we expect\nthe system to attain the largest reduced energy E\u2217B when the particles are\nmost classical; a completely classical system would have E\u2217B =1 since the\nparticles would maintain a spacing equal to the minimum in the potential.\nThe criterion for \"most classical\" is the largest value of the de Boer quantum\nh\n\u0003 where m is the mass of the interacting particles,\nparameter: \u039b\u2217 = \u0002\n\u03c3(m\u01eb)1/2\nassumed to be the same. The values are \u039b\u2217 = 3.1, 2.7 and 1.7 for the sequence\n3 He, 4 He and H , respectively .\n2\nFigure 1 presents the exact and variational energies for the various He\ncases. There is seen to be a maximum binding energy of order 1 to 2 K, with\n\n\fM.K. Kostov, E.S. Hernandez and M.W. Cole\n\nFig. 2. Normalized probability density as a function of polar angle for the\nvarious cases studied here.\nspecific values 1.97 K, 1.38 K and 0.88 K for the sequence 4 He - 4 He, 3 He 4 He and 3 He - 3 He, respectively. This trend manifests the expected decrease\nof binding energy with increasing \u039b\u2217 ; a similar behavior was reported by\nKili\u0107 et al. for dimers confined to either flat surfaces or to the interior of an\nspherical cavity 7,8 . The maximum binding occurs with R/\u03c3 \u223c 0.72, 0.76\nand 0.80. This is analogous to the case of dimer binding of He isotopes on\na cylindrical surface3 , with a (somewhat smaller) maximum binding at R/\u03c3\n=0.65. The smaller value of R/\u03c3 in the cylindrical case is expected because\nthe a(r) cutoff of long range contributions to the attraction, mentioned above,\nis not present there.\nFigure 1 also shows the result of a variational calculation, using a trial\nwave function \u03a8v (r) of the form:\n1 b\u03c3 n\n.\n(2)\n\u03a8v (r) = exp \u2212\n2 r\nThe two variational parameters b and n were optimized for each radius.\nThe resulting energy in the 3 He - 3 He case, shown in Fig. 1, has b=1.80 and\nn=2.50 at the optimal radius R/\u03c3=0.80. Note that the variational result for\nthe binding energy is significantly lower than the exact binding energy, while\nthe optimized radius is nearly identical to the exact one, R/\u03c3 =0.80. An\nanalogous situation was found in the problem of the dimer on a cylinder6 .\nThere, the optimized variational binding energy was 0.084 K, while the exact\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0015\n\n\fBound state of dimers on a spherical surface\n\nFig. 3. Binding energy for H2 - H2 as a function of sphere radius.\nenergy was 0.218 K. Interestingly, the two calculations yielded the same\noptimal radius in that case too.\nFigure 2 compares the probability densities for the various cases studied\nhere. The characteristic feature is an increasing localization near the south\npole as the system becomes more classical, as implied by the a(r) discussion above. Note that the probabilities derived from the variational wave\nfunctions are more diffuse than the exact solutions.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the exact binding energy for the H2 - H2 dimer. In\nthis case, the most classical of the group reported here, the maximum E\u2217B is\n0.5. This value is much closer to the classical value (1) than that for 4 He 4 He (E\u2217 =0.2). One might not have anticipated such a large increase in E\u2217\nB\nB\nsince the \u039b\u2217 parameters are not so different ( 2.7 vs 1.8). Note, however,\nthat for the He isotopes, just a 15% difference between values of \u039b\u2217 leads to\na factor of two difference in E\u2217B . Evidently, the quantum parameter plays\na critical role in this problem because the hard core potential confines the\natoms to a fairly small domain on the surface.\n\n3.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have found particularly large binding energies for dimers of He and\nH2 when the particles are constrained to move on spherical surfaces having\n\n\fM.K. Kostov, E.S. Hernandez and M.W. Cole\n\nR/\u03c3 \u223c3/4. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that found previously\nfor cylindrical surfaces. A possible next step would be to explore the quantum virial expansion on this surface. Such a theory would take a different\nform from the phase shift approach used for extended systems. From the\nexperimental point of view, the present work suggests the intriguing possibility of spectroscopic observations of these dimer states, e.g. in a mixture\nof C60 molecules and He atoms. A quantitative prediction would require a\nstudy of both the excited state spectrum and the role of the third dimension,\nassociated with the radial motion, which is ignored in the present work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research is supported by NSF grants DMR-0208520 and INT0124087, SANCOM collaboration between Penn State and Air Products and\nChemicals, Inc., ANPCYT(#PICT03-08450) and University of Buenos Aires\n(#UBA-X103).\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
