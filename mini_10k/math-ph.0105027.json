By contrast, for the scalar and electromagnetic fields it has been shown that weighted averages of the energy density\nalong timelike curves satisfy 'quantum weak energy inequalities' (QWEIs) which\nconstitute lower bounds on these quantities. Previously, Dirac QWEIs have been\nobtained only for massless fields in two-dimensional spacetimes. In this paper we\nestablish QWEIs for the Dirac and Majorana fields of mass m \u2265 0 on general\nfour-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes, averaging along arbitrary smooth\ntimelike curves with respect to any of a large class of smooth compactly supported\npositive weights. Our proof makes essential use of the microlocal characterisation\nof the class of Hadamard states, for which the energy density may be defined by\npoint-splitting.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn general relativity, it is customary to assume that the stress-energy tensor satisfies one\nor more of the classical energy conditions; the weak energy condition, for example, being\nthe assertion that the energy density measured by any observer is nonnegative. The\nprimary motivation behind these energy conditions is that they ensure that gravity acts\nas an attractive force (in the sense of focussing geodesic congruences) in accordance with\nour experience of gravitation on a wide range of scales. It is therefore natural to assume\nthat physically reasonable forms of classical matter obey such conditions, and to regard\nmatter theories (such as the nonminimally coupled scalar field [4, 43, 12, 17]) violating\nsuch conditions as being of questionable physical significance on many scales. Moreover,\nthe energy conditions have proved to be of great value in obtaining deep results in classical\ngeneral relativity, such as the positive mass and singularity theorems [39, 48, 21].\nHowever, it is well known that all the pointwise energy conditions are violated in\nquantum field theory. Indeed, Epstein, Glaser and Jaffe [6] proved that no Wightman\nfield theory on Minkowski space can admit a (nontrivial) energy density observable whose\nexpectation values are bounded from below and vanish in the Minkowski vacuum state.\nMoreover, in linear field theories (both in flat and curved spacetimes) it is easy to construct states whose energy density at a given point may be tuned to be arbitrarily negative [3, 26]. This raises the possibility that quantum matter might be used to construct\nspacetimes with exotic properties, such as traversable wormholes [18] or so-called 'warp\ndrive' spacetimes [33], usually excluded by the classical energy conditions. One might\nalso ask whether the conclusions of the singularity theorems remain valid for quantum\nmatter. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand how classical matter contrives to obey\nthe classical energy conditions, given that its fundamental constituents need not.\nOne profitable line of enquiry, starting with the work of Ford [14], has been to investigate weighted averages of the renormalised energy density along the worldline of an\nobserver, or over a small spacetime region. It turns out that the expectation values of\nthese averaged observables are bounded from below independently of the state, and such\nbounds have been developed in successively greater generality over the last few years\n[16, 34, 11, 7, 9, 22, 8]. Most recently, one of us [8] has established the existence of\nsuch bounds (and given an explicit, though not optimal, lower bound) for the minimally\ncoupled real linear scalar field in any globally hyperbolic spacetime, in the case where\naveraging is performed with respect to proper time along any smooth timelike curve using\nan arbitrary smooth compactly supported positive weight belonging to the class1\nW = {f \u2208 C0\u221e (R) | f (\u03c4 ) = g(\u03c4 )2 for some real-valued g \u2208 C0\u221e (R)} .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe constraints imposed by these lower bounds have been called 'quantum inequalities' by various authors. However, as we hope to discuss elsewhere, there seem to be\nstrong parallels between the phenomena discussed above and various situations arising\nin quantum mechanics. Indeed, quantum inequalities appear to be a widespread feature\nof quantum theory as a whole, stemming ultimately from the uncertainty principle. In\nthis light, we adopt the more specific terminology 'quantum weak energy inequality' (or\nQWEI) in relation to lower bounds on the renormalised energy density of a quantum field.\n1\n\nSee the remarks following Theorem 4.1 for a brief discussion of this class.\n\n1\n\n\fThere are also related constraints which demand that the integral of the energy density\nover any complete (i.e. inextendible) smooth timelike or lightlike ('null'-) curve be nonnegative. These are called the 'averaged weak energy condition' (AWEC) or 'averaged null\nenergy condition' (ANEC), respectively; they may be viewed as a limiting case of QWEIs\nwhen the weight function (f in eqn. (1.2) below) against which the energy density is\nintegrated along a timelike or lightlike curve approaches the unit function. Historically,\nit was first pointed out in a work by Tipler [41] that suitable versions of AWEC or\nANEC imply singularity theorems in general relativity similar to those which one obtains\nfrom pointwise positivity conditions on the energy density. Subsequently, the question\nof whether quantum fields obey AWEC or ANEC has been investigated in a number of\nworks [26, 13, 46, 49, 50, 15, 12, 42]. Most of these references treat linear quantum fields;\n[42] establishes ANEC for general (axiomatic) quantum field theory in two-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime. A study of the interrelations between averaged energy conditions\nand QWEIs is contained in [15]. We refer to [12] for further discussion and review of\naveraged energy conditions.\nQWEIs place stringent constraints on attempts to generate exotic spacetimes [18, 33]\nand may open a route towards proving results analogous to the singularity theorems for\nquantum matter [49, 50]. To date, however, most QWEI results have been obtained\nfor scalar field theories, while the more physically interesting electromagnetic and Dirac\nfields have received comparatively little attention. Ford and Roman have considered the\nelectromagnetic field in Minkowksi space [16] and shown that a QWEI holds for averaging\nagainst the Lorentzian weight f (\u03c4 ) = \u03c40 /[\u03c0(\u03c4 2 + \u03c402 )] along timelike geodesics; this result\nwas generalised to static trajectories in static spacetimes by Pfenning [31], who has also\nremoved the restriction to Lorentzian weights [32]. It is reasonable to suppose that even\nmore general QWEIs may be obtained for this case.\nBoth the scalar and electromagnetic fields have the property that the classical energy density is manifestly nonnegative, a fact which underpins all the results on these\nfields. The Dirac field is technically very different in that the 'classical' energy density\nis unbounded both from above and below; in second quantization, renormalisation serves\nthe dual purpose of restoring finiteness and imposing positivity of the Hamiltonian. This\nproblem appears to have restricted progress on the Dirac field to date. The main contribution has been that of Vollick, who established a QWEI for Dirac fields in two-dimensional\nspacetimes [45] by converting the problem to one involving a scalar field and then adapting\narguments due to Flanagan [11]. There seems little prospect of generalising this argument\nbeyond the two-dimensional setting. In four dimensions, Vollick has also given explicit\nexamples of states with locally negative energy densities [44] and demonstrated that the\nresulting energy densities nonetheless obey QWEIs modelled on those for the scalar field.\nIn this paper we establish a general QWEI for massive or massless Dirac fields on\nfour-dimensional2 globally hyperbolic spacetimes. To be more specific, let \u03b3 be a smooth\ntimelike curve, parametrized by its proper time \u03c4 , in a globally hyperbolic spacetime\n(M, g). Let \u03c90 be a given (but arbitrary) Hadamard state3 of the Dirac field on (M, g).\nThe state \u03c90 is used as a 'reference state' to define the expected normal ordered energy\n2\n\nThe restriction to four dimensions is purely for convenience: our methods would apply in more general\ndimensions.\n3\nSee Sec. 2 for a brief review of the concepts used here.\n\n2\n\n\fdensity h: T00 :i\u03c9 for any other Hadamard state \u03c9. Our main result, Theorem 4.1 asserts\nthat\nZ\ninf d\u03c4 h: T00 :i\u03c9 (\u03b3(\u03c4 ))f (\u03c4 ) > \u2212\u221e,\n(1.2)\n\u03c9\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over the class of Hadamard states and f belongs to the class\nW . In principle our arguments yield an explicit lower bound for the left-hand side of (1.2).\nThis expression is unfortunately not particularly enlightening and is not expected to be\nsharp. Let us note that (1.2) remains true if the normal ordered energy density is replaced\nby the renormalised energy density, as these two quantities differ by a smooth function.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. We begin, for completeness and to fix notation, by\nreviewing the theory of the quantized Dirac field in Sec. 2. Particular attention is given to\nthe class of Hadamard states, which may be characterised by a microlocal spectrum condition on the wave-front set of the two-point function. This formulation of the Hadamard\ncondition is technically convenient and allows us to bring the tools of microlocal analysis\nto bear. Sec. 3 explains how the normal ordered energy density may be constructed by\npoint-splitting.\nThe proof of our QWEI begins in Sec. 4, using the following strategy. The averaged\nnormal ordered energy density is first expressed as an integral over R2 ; decomposing this\nintegral according to the quadrants of R2 , each piece is then split further into four using\na decomposition induced by the reference state \u03c90 . All but two of the resulting sixteen\ncontributions can be bounded (both above and below) using estimates obtained in Sec. 5.\nThe remaining terms are then expressed in the form R = lim\u039b\u2192+\u221e Tr J\u039b W where J\u039b and\nW are self-adjoint and J\u039b is independent of \u03c9. The parameter \u039b \u2208 R+ defines a cut-off,\nused to avoid domain problems. We prove that W is positive and trace-class with bounded\ntrace as \u03c9 varies. To conclude that R is bounded below, it then suffices to establish that\nthe operators J\u039b are bounded below uniformly in \u039b. This is accomplished in Sec. 6,\ncompleting the proof of our QWEI. In Sec. 7 we briefly describe how our arguments can\nalso be applied to the Majorana field.\nConventions: The metric signature is (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212).

We will follow\nDimock's work [5] to large extent.\nWe will consider Dirac fields in a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime\n(M, g). To begin with, we recall that a globally hyperbolic spacetime is a Lorentzian\nspacetime admitting a Cauchy surface, the latter being a smooth hypersurface in M\nwhich is intersected exactly once by each inextendible causal curve in (M, g). We will\nalso suppose that (M, g) is orientable and time-orientable, and that such orientations\nhave been chosen. Then (M, g) possesses a spin-structure, that is, there is a principal\nfibre bundle S(M, g) having SL(2, C) as structure group, acting from the right, together\nwith a 2-1 fibre-bundle homomorphism \u03c8 : S(M, g) \u2192 F (M, g) which projects S(M, g)\nonto the frame bundle F (M, g). That is to say, \u03c8 preserves base-points and obeys\n\u03c8 \u25e6 Rs = R\u039b(s) \u25e6 \u03c8 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R denotes the right action of the structure groups on the principal fibre bundles\ninvolved and SL(2, C) \u220b s 7\u2192 \u039b(s) \u2208 L+\u2191 is the covering projection onto the proper\northochronous Lorentz group. We recall that F (M, g) is the bundle of oriented and timeoriented tetrads (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ), so that g(ea , eb ) = \u03b7ab with \u03b7ab = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) where\ne0 is timelike and future-pointing and the tetrad is given the orientation of M.\nMoreover, a collection of 4 \u00d7 4-matrices \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 is called a set of Dirac matrices if\n\u03b3a \u03b3b + \u03b3b \u03b3a = 2\u03b7ab * 11 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nA theorem due to Pauli states that, if \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 and \u03b30\u2032 , . . . , \u03b33\u2032 are two sets of Dirac\nmatrices, then there is an invertible matrix M so that \u03b3a = M\u03b3a\u2032 M \u22121 . Any set of Dirac\n\u039b( . )\n\nmatrices \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 is connected to the covering SL(2, C) \u2212\u2192 L+\u2191 in the following way.\nLet Spin(1, 3) consist of all unimodular 4 \u00d7 4-matrices S so that\nS\u03b3a S \u22121 = \u03b3b \u039bb a\n\n(2.3)\n\nholds for some real numbers \u039bb a = \u039bb a (S). It follows from the defining properties of\nDirac matrices that \u039bb a (S) is contained in the Lorentz group. The restriction of the map\nS 7\u2192 \u039bb a (S) in (2.3) to Spin0 (1, 3), the unit connected component of Spin(1, 3), is a group\nhomomorphism with range L+\u2191 , and thus Spin0 (1, 3) is isomorphic to SL(2, C).\nSometimes it is useful to distinguish sets of Dirac matrices with certain properties.\nOne says that a set \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 of Dirac matrices belongs to a standard representation if\n\u03b30\u2217 = \u03b30\n\nand \u03b3k\u2217 = \u2212\u03b3k .\n4\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fHere, \u03b3a\u2217 is the hermitean adjoint of \u03b3a . A set of Dirac matrices which belongs to a standard\nrepresentation and has the additional property that the complex conjugate matrices fulfill\n\u03b3 a = \u2212\u03b3a ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nis said to belong to a Majorana representation.\nWe will now suppose that we are given a globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g) together\nwith a spin-structure (S(M, g), \u03c8) and a set of Dirac matrices \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 which we will\nassume, for the sake of notational simplicity, to belong to a standard representation. (We\nnote, however, that everything which follows could also be carried out in a similar way\nwithout that assumption.) As was pointed out above, via the isomorphism Spin0 (1, 3) \u2243\nSL(2, C), C4 carries a representation of the universal covering group of L+\u2191 which is given\nby the action of the matrices S in Spin0 (1, 3) on vectors in C4 . Via Spin0 (1, 3) \u2243 SL(2, C),\nwe can also regard S(M, g) as a Spin0 (1, 3)-principal bundle and form the associated vector\nbundle\nDM = S(M, g) \u22c9Spin0 (1,3) C4 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThat is, the fibre of DM at p \u2208 M consists of the orbits\n[sp , x] = {(RS\u22121 sp , Sx) : S \u2208 Spin0 (1, 3)}\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor sp \u2208 S(M, g)p and x \u2208 C4 . There is a fibrewise left action of Spin0 (1, 3) on DM by\nLS [sp , x] = [sp , Sx] . Elements in DM are called spinors, and elements in the dual bundle\nD \u2217 M are called cospinors. Moreover, if E is a (local) section in S(M, g), then it induces\non one hand a tetrad field (e0 , . . . , e3 ) = \u03c8 \u25e6 E, i.e. a (local) smooth section in F (M, g),\nvia the spin-structure, and on the other hand it induces a set (EA )4A=1 of (local) smooth\nsections in DM, defined by\nEA = [E, bA ]\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere b1 , . . . , b4 is the standard basis in C4 . There are corresponding dual tetrad fields\n(e0 , . . . , e3 ) defined by eb (ea ) = \u03b4ab and (E B )4B=1 defined by E B (EA ) = \u03b4AB . The eb are\nsmooth sections in T \u2217 M, and the E B are smoth sections in D \u2217 M, the dual bundle to\nDM. We shall denote by C \u221e (DM) and C \u221e (D \u2217 M) the sets of smooth sections in DM\nand D \u2217 M, respectively. The notation for smooth sections in T M and T \u2217 M will be similar.\nWith respect to the given set of Dirac matrices, one can define a section \u03b3 in C \u221e (T \u2217 M)\u2297\nC \u221e (DM) \u2297 C \u221e (D \u2217 M), i.e. a mixed spinor-tensor field, by setting its components \u03b3b A B\nin the induced frame eb \u2297 EA \u2297 E B to be equal to the matrix elements (\u03b3b )A B of \u03b3b . This\ndefinition is independent of the induced frames, i.e. independent of the chosen (local)\nsection E in S(M, g). (Once the set of Dirac matrices \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 is given, \u03b3 encodes the\nspin-structure at the level of DM.)\nMoreover, there is an anti-linear isomorphism DM \u2192 D \u2217 M induced by forming the\nB\nDirac adjoint: If u = uA EA is a spinor, one can assign to it a cospinor u+ = u+\nwith\nBE\ncomponents\nA\nu+\nB = u \u03b30AB\n\n5\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fwhere \u03b30AB are the matrix elements of \u03b30 . This assignment possesses an inverse (denoted\nby the same symbol), where a cospinor v = vB E B is mapped to a spinor v + having\ncomponents v +A = \u03b30 AB vB . Again, \u03b30 AB are the matrix elements of \u03b30 . The operation\nof taking the Dirac adjoint gives rise to anti-linear isomorphisms between C \u221e (DM) and\nC \u221e (D \u2217 M) in the obvious manner.\nThe metric-induced covariant derivative \u2207 on C \u221e (T M) induces a covariant derivative,\nalso denoted by \u2207, on C \u221e (DM). If (e0 , . . . , e3 ) and (EA )3A=1 are induced by a section E\nin S(M, g) and f = f A EA is a local section in DM, then\n\u2207f = \u2207b f A (eb \u2297 EA ) \u2208 C \u221e (T \u2217 M) \u2297 C \u221e (DM)\n\n(2.10)\n\nhas the frame components\n\u2207b f A = \u2202b f A + \u03c3b A B f B ,\n\nwhere \u2202b f A = df A (eb ) ,\n\n1\n\u03c3b A B = \u2212 \u0393abd \u03b3a A C \u03b3 dC B . (2.11)\n4\n\nHere, df A is the differential of the function f A , and we read the components of the Dirac\nmatrices on the right hand side while \u0393abd are Christoffel's connection coefficients, defined\nby\n\u2207k = (\u2202b k a + \u0393abd k d )eb \u2297 ea\n\n(2.12)\n\nfor k = k b eb \u2208 C \u221e (T M).\nThe covariant derivative \u2207 can be extended to cospinor fields and mixed spinor-tensor\nfields by requiring the Leibniz rule and commutativity with contractions. Thus, if h =\nhB E B is a cospinor field, then \u2207h = \u2207b hB eb \u2297 E B has the components\n\u2207b hB = \u2202b hB \u2212 hC \u03c3b C B .\n\n(2.13)\n\nIt follows that \u2207\u03b3 = 0.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Dirac Equation\n\nThe Dirac-operator \u2207\n/ is a first order differential operator taking spinor fields to spinor\nfields, or cospinor fields to cospinor fields; it is defined as the action of the covariant\nderivative followed by contraction with the spinor-tensor \u03b3. More precisely, if f = f A EA \u2208\nC \u221e (DM) and h = hB E B \u2208 C \u221e (D \u2217 M), then\n\u2207\n/ f = (\u2207\n/ f )A EA = \u03b7 ab \u03b3a A B \u2207b f B EA ,\n\u2207\n/ h = (\u2207\n/ h)B E B = \u03b7 ab \u2207b hC \u03b3a C B E B .\n\n(2.14)\n(2.15)\n\nAn important property of the Dirac operator is that it commutes with taking the Dirac\nadjoint, i.e.\n(\u2207\n/ f )+ = \u2207\n/ f+\n\nand (\u2207\n/ h)+ = \u2207\n/ h+\n\nfor f \u2208 C \u221e (DM) and h \u2208 C \u221e (D \u2217 M) .\n6\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fThe Dirac equation is the following first order partial differential equation for spinor\nfields u \u2208 C \u221e (DM) or for cospinor fields v \u2208 C \u221e (D \u2217 M):\n(\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)u = 0 ,\n(i\u2207\n/ + m)v = 0 ,\n\n(2.17)\n(2.18)\n\nP = (i\u2207\n/ + m)(\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere m \u2265 0 is a constant. Then\n\nis the Lichnerowicz wave operator on spinors or cospinors. It is a second order wave\noperator which has metric principal part, and owing to global hyperbolicity of (M, g) this\nimplies that the Cauchy problem for the corresponding wave equations is well-posed and\nthat P possesses uniquely determined advanced and retarded fundamental solutions. As\nshown in [5], this implies that the Dirac operators \u2212i\u2207\n/ + m on spinor fields and i\u2207\n/ +m\non cospinor fields possess uniquely determined pairs of advanced(\u2212) and retarded(+)\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nfundamental solutions Ssp\nand Scosp\n, respectively: This means that, for the spinor case,\n\u00b1\nSsp\n: C0\u221e (DM) \u2192 C \u221e (DM)\n\n(2.20)\n\nare continuous linear maps so that\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n(\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)Ssp\nu = u = Ssp\n(\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)u\n\n(2.21)\n\n\u00b1\nholds for all u \u2208 C0\u221e (DM) and, moreover, supp Ssp\nu is contained in the causal future(+)/causal past(\u2212) of supp u. (We note that our convention concerning advanced/retarded fundamental solutions is opposite to that in [38].) The cospinor case is analogous.\nThen one defines the retarded-minus-advanced fundamental solutions\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 Ssp\nSsp = Ssp\n\n\u2212\n+\n.\n\u2212 Scosp\nand Scosp = Scosp\n\n(2.22)\n\nIn order to quantize the Dirac field, it is very convenient to 'double' the system by\ntaking pairs of spinor fields and cospinor fields together, as was done in the references\n[28, 29, 23]. We give here an equivalent version which makes contact with the notation\nused in [38]. To this end, let us denote C0\u221e (DM) by Dsp and C0\u221e (D \u2217 M) by Dcosp , and\ndefine the doubled space Ddouble = Dcosp \u2295 Dsp . On Ddouble we introduce the sesquilinear\nform\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013\nh1\nh2\n,\n= hf1+ , f2 i \u2212 hh1 , h+\n(2.23)\n2i\nf1\nf2\nfor h1 , h2 \u2208 Dcosp and f1 , f2 \u2208 Dsp , where for v \u2208 Dcosp and u \u2208 Dsp we employ the dual\npairing\nZ\nhv, ui =\nd\u03bcg (p) vp (up )\n(2.24)\nM\n\nwith d\u03bcg denoting the canonical 4-volume form induced by the metric g on M. This\n\u2032\ndual pairing also embeds Dcosp in the (topological) dual space Dsp\nof Dsp , and vice versa,\n7\n\n\f\u2032\nembeds Dsp in Dcosp\n. The sesquilinear form ( . , . ) is non-degenerate, but not positive. A\nuseful relation is\n\nhScosp h, f i = \u2212hh, Ssp f i\n\n(2.25)\n\nfor h \u2208 Dcosp and f \u2208 Dsp .\nLet us define the conjugate-linear isomorphism \u0393 : Ddouble \u2192 Ddouble , playing the role\nof a charge-conjugation, by\n\u0012\u0014 \u0015\u0013 \u0014 + \u0015\nf\nh\n.\n(2.26)\n=\n\u0393\nh+\nf\nThen one finds that \u0393 is a skew-conjugation with respect to ( . , . ), namely it holds that\n(\u0393F1 , \u0393F2 ) = \u2212(F2 , F1 ) \u2200 F1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble .\nNow we introduce the following 'doubled' operators on Ddouble :\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u2212\u2207\n/ \u2212 im\n0\n\u2212\u2207\n/ + im\n0\n,\n, D\u2701 =\nD\u2704 =\n0\n\u2207\n/ \u2212 im\n0\n\u2207\n/ + im\n\u0013\n\u0012\niScosp 0\n.\nS\u2701 =\n0\niSsp\n\n(2.27)\n\n(2.28)\n(2.29)\n\nThen it holds that\nD\u2701 D\u2704 = D\u2704 D\u2701 = Pdouble =\n\n\u0012\n\nPcosp 0\n0\nPsp\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere P... denotes the Lichnerowicz wave operator on spinors and cospinors, respectively;\nmoreover, one finds that \u0393 commutes with Pdouble and\n\u0393D\u2701 = \u2212D\u2701 \u0393 , \u0393D\u2704 = \u2212D\u2704 \u0393,\n(2.31)\n(D\u2701 F1 , F2 ) = \u2212(F1 , D\u2701 F2 ) , (D\u2704 , F1 , F2 ) = \u2212(F1 , D\u2704 F2 ) \u2200 F1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble . (2.32)\nOne may also check that S\u2701\u00b1 (defined in obvious analogy to S\u2701 ) are the retarded(+)/advanced(\u2212) fundamental solutions for the operator D\u2704 ; consequently\nD\u2704 S \u2701 = S \u2701 D\u2704 = 0 .\n\n(2.33)\n\nFurthermore, from (2.31) one can see that\n\u0393S\u2701 = \u2212S\u2701 \u0393 .\n\n(2.34)\n\nThis entails that \u0393 is a complex conjugation for the sesquilinear form\n(F1 , F2 )S = (S\u2701 F1 , F2 ) ,\n\nF1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble ,\n\n(2.35)\n\n\u2200 F1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble .\n\n(2.36)\n\nso that\n(\u0393F1 , \u0393F2 )S = (F2 , F1 )S\n8\n\n\fOn the other hand one can see that (cf. (2.25))\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0012\u0014\nh2\nh1\n= \u2212ihf1+ , Ssp f2 i + ihScosp h2 , h+\n,\n1i\nf2\nf1\nS\n\n(2.37)\n\nand this implies by Prop. 2.2 in [5] that ( . , . )S is positive-semidefinite, (F, F )S \u2265 0.\nNow we introduce the quotient space Ddouble /ker S\u2701 and denote by H its completion with respect to ( . , . )S . The conjugation \u0393 induces by (2.34) a conjugation on H\nwhich will again be denoted by \u0393. Hence, we have derived from the doubled Dirac equation a complex Hilbert-space H (with scalar product ( . , . )S ) together with a complex\nconjugation \u0393. The system can be quantized, following Araki [1], by assigning to these\ndata the algebra of canonical anti-commutation relations CAR(H , \u0393). This is the unique\nC \u2217 -algebra with unit 11 which is generated by a family {B(v) : v \u2208 H } subject to the\nrelations:\n(i) v 7\u2192 B(v) is C-linear,\n(ii) B(\u0393v) = B(v)\u2217 ,\n(iii) B(v)\u2217 B(w) + B(w)B(v)\u2217 = (v, w)S * 11 .\nNow let q : Ddouble \u2192 Ddouble /ker S\u2701 denote the quotient map, then we define the quantized Dirac field as the linear map which assigns to each h \u2208 Dcosp the element\n\u0012 \u0014 \u0015\u0013\nh\n(2.38)\n\u03a8(h) = B q\n0\nin CAR(H , \u0393). The adjoint spinor field will be defined by\n\u0012 \u0014 \u0015\u0013\n0\n+\n, f \u2208 Dsp .\n\u03a8 (f ) = B q\nf\n\n(2.39)\n\nAs a consequence of (iii), the field and its adjoint satisfy the anti-commutation relations\n\u03a8(h)\u03a8+ (f ) + \u03a8+ (f )\u03a8(h) = \u2212ihh, Ssp f i .\n\n(2.40)\n\nWe also note that, owing to (2.33), B(q(D\u2704 F )) = 0, and this entails\n\u03a8((i\u2207\n/ + m)h) = 0 and \u03a8+ ((\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)f ) = 0\n\n(2.41)\n\nfor all h \u2208 Dcosp and f \u2208 Dsp .\nRemarks. (i) \u03a8 acts linearly on cospinors and fulfills, in the sense of distributions, the\nequation (\u2212i\u2207\n/ + m)\u03a8 = 0, therefore the map h 7\u2192 \u03a8(h) is regarded as a spinor field.\n+\nSimilarly, \u03a8 acts linearly on spinor fields and fulfills in distributional sense (i\u2207\n/ +m)\u03a8+ =\n0; hence it is viewed as a cospinor field.\n(ii) \u03a8 and \u03a8+ are C \u2217 -valued distributions since e.g. 2||\u03a8+ (f )||2 = \u2212ihf + , Ssp f i and\nDsp \u2297 Dsp \u220b f1 \u2297 f2 7\u2192 \u2212ihf1+ , Ssp f2 i is continuous (with respect to the usual test-function\ntopology).\n9\n\n\f(iii) We briefly comment on the case where \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b33 belong to a Majorana representation\n(as considered in [38]) and one wishes to quantize the Majorana field. In that situation,\nDcosp (and similarly, Dsp ) carries an 'intrinsic' charge conjugation \u0393 given by v = vB E B 7\u2192\nvB E B in any frame. Then \u0393 is a skew-conjugation for the sesquilinear form\nZ\n\u2032\n(h, h ) =\nd\u03bcg(p) h\u2032p (h+\n(2.42)\np)\nM\n\non Dcosp . Upon defining D\u2704 = \u2207\n/ \u2212 im, D\u2701 = \u2207\n/ + im and S\u2701 = iScosp , one obtains similar\nrelations as before. Then H arises as completion of Dcosp /ker S\u2701 and (h, h\u2032 )S = (S\u2701 h, h\u2032 ).\nThe field operators then simplify to\n\u03a8(h) = B(q(h));\n\n\u03a8+ (f ) = \u03a8(f + )\u2217 = \u03a8(\u0393f + )\n\n(2.43)\n\nfor h \u2208 Dcosp , f \u2208 Dsp . In other words, the Majorana field may be quantized without\ndoubling the classical system. Instead of starting with Dcosp one can likewise consider\nDsp ; this has been done in [38].\n\n2.3\n\nHadamard states\n\nWe recall that a state on a C \u2217 -algebra C is a linear functional \u03c9 : C \u2192 C fulfilling \u03c9(11) = 1\nand \u03c9(A\u2217 A) \u2265 0 for all A \u2208 C. For the purpose of the present work, it is sufficient to\nfocus on the two-point functions \u03c92 of states \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393). The two-point function\n\u03c92 of \u03c9 is an element in (Ddouble \u2297 Ddouble )\u2032 given by\n\u03c92 (F1 \u2297 F2 ) = \u03c9(B(q(F1 ))B(q(F2 ))) ,\n\nF1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble .\n\n(2.44)\n\nIt was shown in [1] that there is for each state \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393) a linear operator Q on\nH with the properties:\n(I) 0 \u2264 Q\u2217 = Q \u2264 1 ,\n(II) Q + \u0393Q\u0393 = 11 ,\n(III) \u03c92 (F1 \u2297 F2 ) = (\u0393q(F1 ), Qq(F2 ))S\n\nfor all F1 , F2 \u2208 Ddouble .\n\nConversely, each linear operator Q with the properties (I) and (II) determines by (III)\nthe two-point function \u03c92 of some state \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393), a so-called quasifree state,\ndetermined by the two-point function \u03c92 (see [1] for discussion). Such a quasifree state \u03c9\nis pure (and then often called a Fock-state) if and only if Q is a projection, i.e. Q2 = Q.\nThe operator Q with the properties (I), (II) and (III) above will be called the operator\nlabelling the quasifree state \u03c9.\nThe stress-energy tensor is defined using the two-point functions of a particular class\nof states, the Hadamard states. One says that a state \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393) is a Hadamard\nstate if we may write\n\u03c92 (F1 \u2297 F2 ) = w(D\u2701 F1 \u2297 F2 )\n\n10\n\n(2.45)\n\n\ffor some distribution w \u2208 (Ddouble \u2297 Ddouble )\u2032 of Hadamard form for the doubled waveoperator Pdouble on Ddouble ; the definition of a Hadamard form for such a wave-operator\nhas been given in [38] (cf. also [28, 29, 23, 30]). This definition entails that the difference\nbetween the two-point functions of two Hadamard states is smooth. For the purposes of\nthis work, we will also need the characterization of Hadamard states in terms of properties\nof the wave-front set WF(\u03c92 ) that appears in [29, 23, 38], following a line of argument\ngiven in [35] for the scalar case. The relevant statement, proven in the references just\nstated, is: A state \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393) is a Hadamard state if and only if the wave-front set\nof its two-point function \u03c92 satisfies the relation\no\nn\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2032 \u2032\n+\n(2.46)\nWF (\u03c92 ) = (p, \u03be; p , \u2212\u03be ) \u2208 \u1e6a (M \u00d7 M) | (p, \u03be) \u223c (p , \u03be ); \u03be \u2208 Np ,\n\nwhere \u1e6a \u2217 (M \u00d7 M) is the cotangent bundle over M \u00d7 M without the zero-section, (p, \u03be) \u223c\n(p\u2032 , \u03be \u2032) means that there is a lightlike geodesic connecting the points p and p\u2032 in M and\nto which \u03be and \u03be \u2032 are co-tangent, and Np+ is the set of all future-directed null covectors\nat p. (We remark that in [38] the opposite sign convention for the Fourier transform was\nchosen, leading to the opposite constraint \u03be \u2208 Np\u2212 (i.e., past-directed null covectors) in\nthat reference compared to (2.46).)\nAt this point we very briefly recall the definition of the wave-front set of a distribution [24]. For a distribution t \u2208 D \u2032 (Rn ), a point (x, k) \u2208 Rn \u00d7 (Rn \\{0}) is called a\nregular directed point of t if there exists \u03c7 \u2208 D(Rn ) with \u03c7(x) 6= 0 and a conic open\nneighbourhood C of k in Rn \\{0} such that\nb \u2032 )| < \u221e \u2200 N \u2208 N .\nsup (1 + |k \u2032 |)N |\u03c7t(k\n\n(2.47)\n\nQ\u0393 = \u0393Q\u0393\n\n(2.48)\n\nk \u2032 \u2208C\n\nb is of rapid decay in C.) The complement in Rn \u00d7(Rn \\{0})\n(If this holds we will say that \u03c7t\nof the set of all regular directed points of t is called the wave-front set WF (t) of t. Given\na scalar distribution \u03c4 on a manifold M, one says that a non-zero covector (p, \u03be) \u2208 \u1e6a \u2217 (M)\nis in WF (\u03c4 ) if there is a coordinate chart (U, \u03ba) around p \u2208 M so that (\u03ba(p), t(\u03ba\u22121 )\u2032 \u03be) \u2208\nWF (\u03c4 \u25e6 \u03ba\u22121 ) where (as discussed at the end of Sec. 1) \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03ba\u22121 \u2208 D \u2032 (\u03ba(U)) is a distribution\non the chart range of \u03ba. This definition of WF (\u03c4 ) is independent of the choice of the\nchart \u03ba. We refer the reader to [24] for further discussion of the properties of wave-front\nset of distributions on manifolds. For the case that \u03c4 is a distribution on test-sections of\na vector bundle, e.g. defined on Ddouble , \u03c4 can be viewed, via (local) trivializations of the\nbundle, as collection (\u03c4 A B )A,B of scalar distributions, and then WF (\u03c4 ) is defined as the\nunion of WF (\u03c4 A B ) over all components A, B. It is not difficult to see that this definition\nis independent of the chosen (local) trivialization.\nNow let \u03c92 be the two-point function of a Hadamard state \u03c9 on CAR(H , \u0393), and let\nQ be the corresponding operator on H with the properties (I),(II) and (III) above. We\nwill use the notation\n\nfor the 'charge conjugate' of Q, and we will adopt this notation also for other operators\non H . In studying the stress-energy tensor, we will be particularly interested in the\n11\n\n\ffollowing distributions on Dsp \u2297 Dcosp associated with \u03c9 (respectively, with Q), which we\nwill also refer to as two-point functions:\n\u03c9Q (f \u2297 h) = \u03c9(\u03a8+ (f )\u03a8(h)) ,\n\n\u0393\n\u03c9Q\n(f \u2297 h) = \u03c9(\u03a8(h)\u03a8+ (f ))\n\n(2.49)\n\n\u0393\nwhere f \u2208 Dsp and h \u2208 Dcosp . Note that \u03c9Q\n= \u03c9Q\u0393 . As a consequence of the constraint\non the wave-front set (2.46) for Hadamard states, which is also called microlocal spectrum\ncondition, one finds that the following microlocal spectrum condition holds for \u03c9Q and\n\u0393\n\u03c9Q\n,\n\nn\n\u266f\nWF (\u03c9Q\n) = (p, \u03be; p\u2032, \u2212\u03be \u2032 ) \u2208 \u1e6a \u2217 (M \u00d7 M) | (p, \u03be) \u223c (p\u2032 , \u03be \u2032);\n\no\n\u03be \u2208 Np\u266f .\n\n(2.50)\n\nHere, and below, we use \u266f and \u266d to denote either the presence or absence of a \u0393 in the\nfollowing context-dependent way:\nQ\u266f\n\n\u266f\n\u03c9Q\n\nNp\u266f\n\nR\u266f\n\nQ\nQ\u0393\n\n\u03c9Q\n\u0393\n\u03c9Q\n\nNp+\nNp\u2212\n\nR+ .\nR\u2212\n\nTo avoid confusion we will sometimes use * as a placeholder to indicate the absence of a\n\u0393. Thus Q* = Q, for example. We note that the microlocal spectrum condition in the\nform (2.50) has been proved directly for quasifree Hadamard states in [29, 23].\nLet us note that (2.49) may be written\n\u0014 \u0015\u0013\n\u0012 \u0014 \u0015\nh\n0\n;\n(2.51)\n, Qq\n\u03c9Q (f \u2297 h) = \u0393q\n0\nf\nS\nas a slight abuse of notation we will use this relation to define \u03c9Q for general bounded\noperators Q on H and refer to \u03c9Q as the two-point function labelled by Q. (Of course \u03c9Q\nis not in general the two-point function of a state.) We will also denote by Had (H , \u0393)\n\u266f\nthe class of operators which obey properties (I) and (II) and such that \u03c9Q\nobeys (2.50).\nThus Had (H , \u0393) parametrizes the quasifree Hadamard states on CAR(H , \u0393).\nOur proof of Thm. 4.1 below relies on the existence of pure, quasifree Hadamard\nstates for the Dirac field. It seems that this has never been established in the literature in\nfull detail, therefore we sketch here how such states may be constructed by adapting an\nargument employed by Fulling, Narcowich and Wald [19] for the case of the free scalar field\nto the Dirac field. The first step is to show that there exists a pure, quasifree Hadamard\nstate for the Dirac field for ultrastatic (M, g). In fact, if (M, g) is ultrastatic, then it\nmay be endowed with a suitable spin structure so that the ultrastatic time shifts give\nrise to a continuous unitary group Ut (t \u2208 R) on H leaving the scalar product ( . , . )S\ninvariant and fulfilling \u0393Ut = Ut \u0393. Moreover, if the mass parameter m appearing in the\nDirac equation is strictly positive, then the spectrum of the self-adjoint generator of Ut\nis bounded away from zero. Theorem 2 in [1], or the results in [47], thus show that\nthere is a pure quasifree state \u03c90 on the CAR algebra of the Dirac field on ultrastatic\n(M, g) which is a ground state for the C \u2217 -dynamics induced by Ut ; the projection P0\nlabelling \u03c90 is the projection onto the positive spectral subspace of the unitary group Ut .\n12\n\n\fSince \u03c90 is a ground state, it fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition [37] and hence is\na Hadamard state [38]. In a second step, one uses a technique developed in [19] which\nallows one to view a neighbourhood of a Cauchy surface of any given globally hyperbolic\nspacetime as being isometrically embedded in a globally hyperbolic spacetime that has\nan ultrastatic part (with suitable spin structure as above) in its past. By the uniqueness\nof the Cauchy problem and the \"propagation of Hadamard form\" under the dynamics of\nthe Dirac equation [38], any pure, quasifree Hadamard state prescribed on the ultrastatic\npart of the spacetime (e.g. \u03c90 ) induces a pure, quasifree Hadamard state everywhere on\nthe spacetime, in particular on the embedded neighbourhood of the Cauchy surface of\nthe initially given globally hyperbolic spacetime. Using the same argument once more,\na pure, quasifree Hadamard state for the Dirac field is thereby induced on any given\nglobally hyperbolic spacetime. The mass parameter m may be allowed to be variable over\nspacetime in this process without affecting the Hadamard form, so that one obtains a\npure, quasifree Hadamard state of the Dirac field on any globally hyperbolic spacetime\nfor any m \u2265 0. The argument just sketched implicitly also shows that there exists an\nabundance of quasifree Hadamard states.\n\n3\n\nA point-split energy density\n\nFor the remainder of this paper, we will assume that (M, g) is globally hyperbolic, orientable and time orientable, with spin structure (S(M, g), \u03c8) and that the Dirac matrices\n\u03b3a belong to a standard representation.\nLet \u03b3 : R \u2192 M be a smooth timelike curve in (M, g), parametrized by its proper\ntime, along which we wish to establish a QWEI. The starting point is the construction of\na normal ordered energy density on \u03b3, which is accomplished as follows. We first claim\nthat there exists a tubular neighbourhood C\u03b3 of \u03b3 and a local section E of S(M, g) over\nC\u03b3 such that the induced tetrad field (e0 , . . . , e3 ) = \u03c8 \u25e6 E satisfies e0 |\u03b3 = u, where u = \u03b3\u0307\nis the velocity of \u03b3. To see this, choose any locally finite open cover {Uj | j \u2208 Z} of \u03b3 by\ncharts Uj such that\n(i). Uj \u2229 Uk = \u2205 unless |j \u2212 k| \u2264 1;\n(ii). Uj \u2229 Uj+1 is contractable for each j \u2208 Z;\n(iii). Uj \u2229 Uk \u2229 Ul = \u2205 if j, k, l are distinct.\nThe existence of such a cover follows from global hyperbolicity of (M, g) since \u03b3 is timelike.\nNow extend u to a smooth\ne on some tubular neighbourhood\nS timelike unit vector field u\nC\u03b3 of \u03b3, so that C\u03b3 \u2282 j Uj . Choose any tetrad (e\u20320 , . . . , e\u20323 ) on C\u03b3 . Then we may\nobtain a tetrad (e0 , . . . , e3 ) with e0 = u\ne by applying a unique boost in L+\u2191 at each point\n(whose parameters are given by the components of u\ne with respect to e\u2032a , and therefore\nvary smoothly). This tetrad lifts smoothly to S(M, g) in each Uj \u2229C\u03b3 and may be patched\ntogether along C\u03b3 to obtain the required section E by virtue of properties (i), (ii) and (iii).5\n5\n\nOf course, there are exactly two such sections.\n\n13\n\n\fNext, we choose smooth spinor fields vA (A = 1, . . . , 4) in C\u03b3 , such that\n\u03b4 AB vA \u2297 vB+ = \u03b30 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis is easily satisfied by taking vA = EA , where EA is the spin frame induced by E;\nhowever, it will be convenient to make a slightly different choice when considering the\nMajorana field. The changes relevant for Majorana fields will be described in Sec. 7.\nWith respect to the frame ea the Dirac stress-energy tensor is\nTab =\n\n\u0001\ni +\n\u03c8 \u03b3(a \u2207b) \u03c8 \u2212 (\u2207(a \u03c8 + )\u03b3b) \u03c8 ,\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhich is manifestly symmetric, and is conserved provided \u03c8 obeys the Dirac equation (2.17).\nIn particular, T00 (\u03b3(\u03c4 )) is the energy density measured by an observer with worldline \u03b3\nat proper time \u03c4 .\nWe may use (3.1) to define a bi-scalar point-split energy density\nT (x, y) = \u03b4 AB\n\n\u0001\ni\n(\u03c8 + vA )(x)(vB+ e0 * \u2207\u03c8)(y) \u2212 ([e0 * \u2207\u03c8 + ]vA )(x)(vB+ \u03c8)(y)\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwith the property that T (x, x) = T00 (x).

Thus,\n\u2207 * [e0 v] = v\u2207 * e0 + e0 * \u2207v\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere, with respect to local coordinates (x\u03bc ), \u2207 * e0 = \u2207\u03bc e\u03bc0 and e0 * \u2207v = e\u03bc0 \u2207\u03bc v. Upon\nquantization, we obtain the algebra-valued bi-distribution T given by\nT (f \u2297 g) = \u03b4 AB\n\n\u0001\ni\n\u03a8+ (\u2207 * [e0 vA f ])\u03a8(vB+ g) \u2212 \u03a8+ (vA f )\u03a8(\u2207 * [e0 vB+ g]) .\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nGiven a state \u03c9 we will now use the same symbol to denote its two-point function\n\u03c9(f \u2297 g) = \u03c9(\u03a8+ (f )\u03a8(g)) and also set vAB = vA \u2297 vB+ . Thus vAB \u03c9 will denote the matrix\nof scalar bi-distributions\nvAB \u03c9(f \u2297 g) = \u03c9(\u03a8+ (vA f )\u03a8(vB+ g)) .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe formulae \u2207*(e0 vA f ) = vA \u2207*(e0 f )+\u03c30 C A f vC and \u2207*(e0 vB+ g) = vB+ \u2207*(e0 g)+\u03c30 C B gvC+\nnow allow us to write the expectation value hT i\u03c9 of T in state \u03c9 as\nhT i\u03c9 = LAB vAB \u03c9 ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere\nLAB =\n\n1\n1\n(11 \u2297 ie0 * \u2207 \u2212 ie0 * \u2207 \u2297 11) \u03b4 AB + \u0398AB ,\n2\n2\n14\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fand\n\u0398AB = i[\u03b4 CB \u03c30 A C \u2297 11 \u2212 11 \u2297 \u03b4 AC \u03c30 B C ] .\n\n(3.10)\n\nIf a reference Hadamard state \u03c90 is now specified, we may define the normal ordered\npoint-split energy density (with respect to \u03c90 ) by\nh: T :i\u03c9 = hT i\u03c9 \u2212 hT i\u03c90 .\n\n(3.11)\n\nh: T :i\u03c9 = LAB vAB : \u03c9 : ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nThis may also be written\n\nwhere : \u03c9 := \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 is the normal ordered two-point function. Since : \u03c9 : is smooth\nfor Hadamard \u03c9, h: T :i\u03c9 is also smooth. Accordingly, the 'coincidence limit' (i.e., the\nrestriction of h: T :i\u03c9 to the diagonal) is well defined and yields the normal ordered energy\ndensity near \u03b3. We denote the energy density along \u03b3 by\nh: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 (\u03c4 ) = h: T :i\u03c9 (\u03b3(\u03c4 ), \u03b3(\u03c4 )) .\n\n(3.13)\n\nNote also that h: T :i\u03c9 (f \u2297 g) is symmetric in f and g by virtue of the CAR's.\nIt will be convenient to regard h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 as the diagonal of the pull-back \u03b32\u2217 h: T :i\u03c9 where\n\u03b32 (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) = (\u03b3(\u03c4 ), \u03b3(\u03c4 \u2032 )). In turn, \u03b32\u2217 h: T :i\u03c9 may be written as the action of a differential\noperator on the pulled-back normal ordered two-point function:\n\u03b32\u2217 h: T :i\u03c9 =\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002\n(11 \u2297 D \u2212 D \u2297 11)\u03b4 AB + \u03b32\u2217 \u0398AB \u03b32\u2217 vAB : \u03c9 : ,\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere D = id/d\u03c4 (strictly speaking, D should be regarded as the distributional dual of\n\u2212id/d\u03c4 ).\n\n4\n\nMain argument\n\nWe now come to the proof of the QWEI for Dirac fields. In the following, (M, g) is\nassumed to satisfy the hypotheses stated at the beginning of the previous section.\nTheorem 4.1 Let \u03b3 : R \u2192 M be a smooth timelike curve in (M, g) parametrized by its\nproper time. Let \u03c90 be a Hadamard state of the Dirac field on (M, g). Define the normal\nordered energy density h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 by (3.13) with respect to the reference state \u03c90 . Then for\nany weight f belonging to W (defined in Eq. (1.1))\nZ\ninf d\u03c4 h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 (\u03c4 )f (\u03c4 ) > \u2212\u221e,\n(4.1)\n\u03c9\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all Hadamard states \u03c9. That is, there exists a quantum\nweak energy inequality for the Dirac field.\n\n15\n\n\fRemarks. (i) If the reference state \u03c90 is changed, h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 is modified by a smooth\nfunction which is independent of \u03c9. Thus we may assume without loss of generality that\n\u03c90 is pure and quasifree. Exactly the same argument entails that (4.1) holds if we replace\nthe normal ordered energy density by the renormalised energy density.\n(ii) Perhaps surprisingly, the class W (of squares of real-valued C0\u221e (R) functions) does\nnot coincide with the class of nonnegative smooth compactly supported functions. In\n\u221e\nfact, Glaeser [20]6 has constructed\np an example of a C nonnegative function f , vanishing\nd2\nonly at the origin, so that dx2 f (x) diverges as x \u2192 0. The delicacy of this point resides\nin the behaviour of f at zeros of infinite order. It is not clear whether the restriction to\nweights in W is purely a technical limitation of our proof, or whether QWEIs should be\nunderstood as quadratic form results (cf.

To this end, choose \u03b7 \u2208 C0\u221e (M) such that\n\u03b7 equals unity on a neighbourhood of \u03b3(I). It is easy to see that h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 is unaltered on I\nif we replace vAB : \u03c9 : in (3.14) by the compactly supported distribution uAB : \u03c9 :, where\nuAB = \u03b7vA \u2297 \u03b7vB+ .\nApplying the formula\nZ\nZ\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\u2032 b\nd\u03c4 F (\u03c4, \u03c4 )\u03c6(\u03c4 ) =\nF (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )\u03c6(\u03bb\nb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 ) ,\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nwhich is valid for F \u2208 C0\u221e (R2 ) and \u03c6 \u2208 C0\u221e (R), one may show that\nZ\nZ\n(\u03c9)\nI = d\u03c4 h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 (\u03c4 )f (\u03c4 ) = d\u03bb d\u03bb\u2032J AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )WAB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )\n\n(4.2)\n\n(4.3)\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere\n(\u03c9)\n\nWAB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032) = [\u03b32\u2217 uAB : \u03c9 :]\u2227 (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nand we have also written\nJ AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) =\nwhere\n\no\n1 n\n\u2032 b\n\u2032 AB\nAB \u2227\n\u2032\n(\u03bb\n+\n\u03bb\n)\nf\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n)\u03b4\n+\n[\u03b8\nf\n]\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n)\n,\n8\u03c0 2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b8AB (\u03c4 ) = \u03b32\u2217 \u0398AB (\u03c4, \u03c4 ) = i \u03b4 CB \u03c30 A C |\u03b3(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b4 AC \u03c30 B C |\u03b3(\u03c4 )\n\n(4.6)\n\n(4.7)\n\nis clearly hermitian (\u03b8BA (\u03c4 ) = \u03b8AB (\u03c4 )). It follows that J AB is a hermitian matrix kernel,\ni.e., J AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) = J BA (\u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb).\n(\u03c9)\nNote that J AB is state-independent, while WAB contains all the dependence on the\nstate of interest \u03c9 and the reference state \u03c90 . We also note that J AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) decays rapidly\naway from the diagonal in R2 .\n6\n\nWe are grateful to S.P. Eveson and P.J. Bushell for help in locating this reference.\n\n16\n\n\fAssuming without loss that \u03c90 is pure and quasifree, it must be labelled by some\nprojection P on H . Since the stress-energy tensor is defined in terms of the two-point\nfunction, it is enough to establish (4.1) when the infimum is taken over quasifree Hadamard\nstates, whose two-point functions are of the form \u03c9Q for Q \u2208 Had (H , \u0393) as discussed in\nSec. 2.3. The normal ordered two-point function : \u03c9Q := \u03c9Q \u2212 \u03c9P is labelled by Q \u2212 P ,\ni.e., : \u03c9Q := \u03c9Q\u2212P in the spirit of the remarks following (2.51). Now\nQ \u2212 P = \u2212P Q\u0393 P + P \u0393QP + P QP \u0393 + P \u0393QP \u0393 ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nand this induces a decomposition of : \u03c9Q : into four pieces\n: \u03c9Q := \u2212\u03c9 * \u0393 * + \u03c9 \u0393 * * + \u03c9 * * \u0393 + \u03c9 \u0393 * \u0393 ,\nwhere \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d is the two-point function labelled by P \u266f Q\u266e P \u266d ; that is,\n\u0014 \u0015\u0013\n\u0012 \u0014 \u0015\nh\n0\n\u266f \u266e \u266d\n\u266f\u266e\u266d\n,P Q P q\n\u03c9 (f \u2297 h) = \u0393q\n0\nf\nS\n\n(4.9)\n\n(4.10)\n\nfor f \u2208 Dsp and h \u2208 Dcosp . In Sec. 5 we will show that each \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d may be pulled back to\nR2 by \u03b32 , allowing us to write\n(\u03c9 )\n\n*\u0393*\n\u0393**\n**\u0393\n\u0393*\u0393\nWABQ = \u2212WAB\n+ WAB\n+ WAB\n+ WAB\n,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2227\n\u266f\u266e\u266d\nWAB\n(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) = \u03b32\u2217 uAB \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) .\n\n(4.12)\n\nFurthermore, the following Q-independent bounds will be established in Sec. 5.\nLemma 4.2 For any Q \u2208 Had (H , \u0393),\n\u266f\u266e\u266d\n\u266f\u266d\nWAB\n(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) \u2264 XAB\n(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032)\n\n\u2200(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) \u2208 R2 ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere XAB is independent of Q and is defined in terms of the reference two-point function\n\u03c9P by\n\u266f\u266d\nXAB\n(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032) = YA\u266f (\u03bb)YB\u266d (\u03bb\u2032 ) ,\n\nwhere YA\u266f (\u03bb) is the positive square root of\ni\u2227\nh\nYA\u266f (\u03bb)2 = \u03b32\u2217 uAA \u03c9P\u266f (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb) (no sum on A).\n\n(4.14)\n\n(4.15)\n\nFurthermore, YA* (\u03bb) (resp. YA\u0393 (\u03bb)) decays rapidly as \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e (resp. \u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e) and is of\npolynomially bounded growth as \u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e (resp. \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e).\n\n17\n\n\fRemarks. (i) The right-hand side of Eq. (4.15) is nonnegative because uAA \u03c9P\u266f is of\npositive type as a scalar bi-distribution, and this property is inherited under pull-back by\n\u03b32 (see Theorem 2.2 in [8]). In fact, the calculation\nuAB \u03c9P\u266f (f A \u2297 f B ) = \u03c9P\u266f (f A uA \u2297 (f B uB )+ ) = \u03c90 (\u03a8(f A uA )\u03a8(f B uB )\u2217 ) \u2265 0\n\n(4.16)\n\n(summing on A and B) for f A \u2208 C0\u221e (M) (A = 1, . . . , 4) shows that uAB \u03c9P\u266f is of positive\ntype as a matrix-valued distribution. Positive type of uAA \u03c9P\u266f follows in consequence. A\nsimilar argument (using (4.10) and the property Q \u2265 0 for Q \u2208 Had (H , \u0393)) shows that\nuAB \u03c9 * \u0393 * , uAB \u03c9 \u0393 * \u0393 and their pull-backs by \u03b32 share the matrix positive type property.\n(ii) The statements on the growth of YA\u266f are obtained from the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz\ntheorem [24] which entails that the Fourier transform of a compactly supported distribution is of at worst polynomial growth. Below, we will frequently use the fact that\nthe product of a rapidly decaying function and one of polynomial growth is itself rapidly\ndecaying.\nBecause the bounds obtained in Lemma 4.2 exhibit different behaviour in the four\nquadrants C1 , . . . , C4 P\nof the (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )-plane it is convenient to decompose the averaged energy\ndensity (4.4) as I =\nIk , where Ik is the contribution arising from quadrant Ck . We\nproceed to bound the Ik in turn.\nStarting with the second and fourth quadrants C2 = R\u2212 \u00d7 R+ and C4 = R+ \u00d7 R\u2212 ,\nLemma 4.2 yields the Q-independent bound\nX \u266f\u266d\n(\u03c9 )\nWABQ (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) \u2264\nXAB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )\n(4.17)\n\u266f\u266d\n\nin which each summand on the right-hand side is of at worst polynomial growth. This may\nbe combined with the rapid decay of J AB away from the diagonal to yield the following\nQ-independent bound on the contribution from these quadrants:\nZ\nX \u266f\u266d\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\u2032 J AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )\nXAB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032) < \u221e .\n(4.18)\n|I2 + I4 | \u2264\nC2 \u222aC4\n\n\u266f\u266d\n\nWe are left with the first and third quadrants. Since J AB exhibits polynomial growth\nalong the diagonal, the previous argument will not allow us to bound all the terms arising\nfrom the decomposition (4.11). To see this, note that Lemma 4.2 applied to the P \u0393QP \u0393\n\u0393*\u0393\n\u0393\u0393\nterm WAB\ngives a bound XAB\ngrowing polynomially7 in all directions in the first quad**\nrant. Similarly, the bound XAB\nfor the P Q\u0393 P term is polynomially growing in the third\nquadrant. However, Lemma 4.2 suffices to bound the other contributions to I1 and I3\n\u266f\u266d\nbecause at least one factor in the relevant XAB\nis rapidly decaying.

The quantities\n\u0393*\u0393\n*\u0393*\nR1 and R3 are real, because J AB , WAB\nand WAB\nare hermitian matrix kernels.\nTo complete the proof of the QWEI it is required to show that R1 and R3 are bounded\nfrom below independently of Q. We will present the argument for R1 in detail and indicate\nhow the proof is modified for R3 . Let \u03c7\u039b (\u039b \u2208 R+ ) be a family of smooth, real-valued,\nnonincreasing functions such that \u03c7\u039b equals unity on [0, \u039b] and vanishes on [\u039b + 1, \u221e).\nIt is clear that\nZ\n\u0393*\u0393\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\u2032\u03c7\u039b (\u03bb)\u03c7\u039b (\u03bb\u2032 )J AB (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 )WAB\n(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032)\n(4.23)\nR1 = lim\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n\nC1\n\nand the cut-off \u03c7\u039b now allows us to interpret the integral as a trace in the following way.\nDefine \u03c3 : R+ \u2192 R by\n\u03c3(\u03bb) = (1 + \u03bb2 )1/2 [1 + |Y \u0393 (\u03bb)|C4 ] ,\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhere | * |C4 is the usual vector norm on C4 . Then \u03c3 is smooth, positive, bounded away\nf on\nfrom zero and of polynomially bounded growth.

This has trivial intersection\nwith WF (uAB \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d ), because no null covector can annihilate a timelike vector. Accordingly, \u03b32\u2217 uAB \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d exists in D \u2032 (R2 ), and (again by Theorem 2.5.11\u2032 in [25]) its wave-front\nset obeys\nWF (\u03b32\u2217 uAB \u03c9 \u266f \u266e \u266d ) \u2282 R \u00d7 R\u266f \u00d7 R \u00d7 \u2212R\u266d .\n\n(5.4)\n\nSince uAB is compactly supported, we may take Fourier transforms and conclude that\n\u266f\u266e\u266d\nthe WAB\ndo indeed exist.

Let us observe that this step depends in an essential way on\nthe fact that, for \u03bc > 0, the argument of b\ng in (6.7) is bounded away from zero, together\nwith the rapid decay property of b\ng.\nThe above analysis entails that \u2212C\u039b is a lower bound for K\u039b , but this is certainly not\nthe sharpest bound.

Now, as in Sec. 3 one may choose, in\na tubular neighbourhood of any timelike curve \u03b3, induced frames (e0 , . . . , e3 ) and (EA )\n25\n\n\fso that e0 |\u03b3 = u, the tangent of \u03b3 in proper time parametrization. However, it is now\nconvenient to set vA = iEA , for then we have the two properties\n\u03b4 AB vA \u2297 vB+ = \u03b30\n\nand\n\n\u0393vA+ = vA+\n\n(7.2)\n\nas we are working in a Majorana representation.\nTo quantize the point-split energy density (3.4), we may substitute from (7.1) and use\nthe formula \u0393[\u2207 * (e0 vA f )]+ = \u2207 * (f e0 vA+ ) for f \u2208 D(M) to obtain\nT (f \u2297 g) = \u03b4 AB\n\n\u0001\ni\n\u03a8(\u2207 * [f e0 vA+ ])\u03a8(vB+ g) \u2212 \u03a8(f vA+ )\u03a8(\u2207 * [e0 vB+ g])\n2\n\n(7.3)\n\nas the replacement for (3.6). The CAR's may be used to show that h: T :i\u03c9 (f \u2297 g) is\nsymmetric in f, g.\n+\nUsing the formula e0 * \u2207vB+ = \u03c30 C\nB vC , it follows that hT i\u03c9 may be expressed in the form\nhT i\u03c9 = LAB vA+ \u2297 vB+ \u03c92 ,\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere \u03c92 (h, h\u2032 ) = \u03c9(\u03a8(h)\u03a8(h\u2032)) is the two-point function and\nLAB =\n\n1\n1\n(11 \u2297 ie0 * \u2207 \u2212 ie0 * \u2207 \u2297 11) \u03b4 AB + \u0398AB ,\n2\n2\n\n(7.5)\n\nwith\n\u0398AB = i[\u03b4 CB \u03c30 A C \u2297 11 \u2212 11 \u2297 \u03b4 AC \u03c30 B C ] .\n\n(7.6)\n\nThe components of \u03c30 are real in a Majorana representation and it follows that \u03b8AB (\u03c4 ) =\n\u03b32\u2217 \u0398AB (\u03c4, \u03c4 ) is hermitian for each \u03c4 . Moreover, vA+ \u2297 vB+ \u03c92 is of matrix positive type as\nshown by the calculation\n(vA+ \u2297 vB+ \u03c92 )(f A \u2297 f B ) = \u03c92 (\u0393[vA+ f A ] \u2297 vB+ f B ) = \u03c9(\u03a8(vA+ f )\u2217 \u03a8(vB+ f B )) \u2265 0\n\n(7.7)\n\nin which we have used \u0393vA+ = vA+ and (7.1).\nFrom this point onwards, one may proceed to define h: \u03c1 :i\u03c9 as in Sec. 3, and the\nstatement and proof of Thm. 4.1 carry over (apart from some obvious changes) upon\nobserving that Hadamard states \u03c9 of the Majorana field obey\no\nn\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2032 \u2032\n+\n(7.8)\nWF (\u03c92 ) = (p, \u03be; p , \u2212\u03be ) \u2208 \u1e6a (M \u00d7 M) | (p, \u03be) \u223c (p , \u03be ); \u03be \u2208 Np\n(cf. [38], note again that in this reference a different sign convention for the Fourier\ntransform was chosen which results in the opposite form of the wave-front set there).\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have established general QWEIs for the Dirac and Majorana fields in\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes. We conclude with various remarks. First, these QWEIs\nhold despite the fact that the 'classical' Dirac equation fails to obey the weak energy\n26\n\n\fcondition. This is encouraging evidence that QWEIs are a widespread feature of all\nquantum field theories and that they are the correct replacement for the classical energy\nconditions. It would be interesting to understand whether QWEIs can be obtained in a\ngeneral axiomatic setting.\nA second point was posed to us by Buchholz (private communication): given a weight\nin W the corresponding averaged energy density may be defined as a symmetric operator\non a suitable dense domain (such as the domain of microlocal smoothness introduced in [2])\nin some Hilbert space representation. The force of our result (and the corresponding result\nin [8]) is that such operators are semibounded, and therefore admit self-adjoint extensions\n(in particular, the Friedrichs extension). Can one give any interpretation to the evolution\ngenerated by this operator? The answer is not clear, but we speculate that there could\nbe a connection with the dynamics discussed by Keyl [27] in his recent study of quantum\nfields on timelike curves. The connection is somewhat tentative (in particular, the role\nof the weight must be understood), and would only be expected to hold under restricted\nconditions such as for static trajectories in static spacetimes. Nonetheless, it remains an\nintriguing possibility.\nFinally, although our approach does lead to explicit lower bounds on the various\ncontributions to the averaged energy density, these are not expected to be optimal. We\nhope to return to this question elsewhere.\nAcknowledgments: We thank the organisers of the meeting on Microlocal Analysis and\nQuantum Field Theory at the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, where\nthis work was commenced.
