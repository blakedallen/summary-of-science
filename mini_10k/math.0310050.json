The fundamental classes of these boundary strata may be linearly dependent in A\u2217 (Mg,n ). Relations among these\nboundary strata can be found by exploiting a localization trick. Let \u03c0 be the\nstabilization map\n\u03c0 : Mg,n (P1 , d) \u2192 Mg,n .\nNote that Mg,n (P1 , d) has a C\u2217 -action induced from the C\u2217 -action on P1 . Mg,n\n\u2217\nhas a trivial C\u2217 -action which makes \u03c0 an equivariant map. If we write AC\n\u2217 (pt) =\nC\u2217\nC[~] then A\u2217 (Mg,n ) = A\u2217 (Mg,n )[~].\nNow, given a \u2208 A\u2217C\u2217 (Mg,n (P1 , d)), we may compute \u03c0\u2217 ([Mg,n (P1 , d)]vir \u2229 a)\nby the following localization formula\n\u0012 vir\n\u0013\n\u0001 X\n[F ] \u2229 i\u2217F a\n\u03c0\u2217 iF \u2217\n(1)\n\u03c0\u2217 [Mg,n (P1 , d)]vir \u2229 a =\ne(\u03bd)\nF\n\n1\n\u2217\n1\nin AC\n\u2217 (Mg,n ) \u2297 C[~, ~ ] where the sum is over C -fixed loci F in Mg,n (P , d),\n1\niF : F \u2192 Mg,n (P , d) and e(\u03bd) is the equivariant Euler class of the normal\nbundle to F in Mg,n (P1 , d).\nNote that the left hand side of (1) is a finite expansion in powers of ~ and\n1\nand\ninvolves no negative powers of ~. The right hand side of (1) involves e(\u03bd)\nso has negative powers of ~ occuring. This means that the coefficient of ~\u2212k\non the right hand side must be zero. Because the coefficient is the sum of cycle\nclasses pushed forward from fixed loci, we obtain relations among the boundary\nstrata in A\u2217 (Mg,n ).\nIn what follows, we will apply this trick to\n\u2217\n\n\u03c0 : M1,4 (P1 , 2) \u2192 M1,4\nand obtain the Getzler relation in A\u2217 (M1,4 )\nThe Getzler relation was first discovered by Getzler in [2] by bounding the\ndimension of H4 (M1,4 ) and computing its intersection matrix. A geometric\n1\n\n\fproof of this relation was given by Pandharipande in [8]. Pandharipande's proof\nmakes heavy use of the branch morphism and can probably also be cast in\nthe more modern language of the degeneration methods of [6]. This note can\nbe thought of as an attempt to modify the proof of Pandharipande to use the\ntechnique of virtual localization.\nI would like to mention that the main technique of this note is used in\na number of papers of Faber and Pandharipande, most recently, implicitly in\nsection 2.2.2 of [1].\nI would like to extend thanks to Ravi Vakil for valuable discussions and to\nRahul Pandharipande for the use of his figures.\n\n2\n\nDimension Count\n\nThe purpose of this section is to state the virtual dimensions of the relevant\nmoduli spaces.\nvdimC Mg,n = 3g \u2212 3 + n\nvdimC Mg,n (P1 , d) = 2g \u2212 2 + 2d + n\nTherefore, the virtual dimension of the fiber of the stabilization map \u03c0 is\nvdimC Mg,n (P1 , d) \u2212 vdimC Mg,n = (2g \u2212 2 + 2d + n) \u2212 (3g \u2212 3 + n) = 1 \u2212 g + 2d\n1\n\u03c0\u2217 ([Mg,n (P1 , d)]vir \u2229a) \u2208 A2g\u22122+2d+n\u2212m (Mg,n ).\nHence if a \u2208 Am\nC\u2217 (Mg,n (P , d)),\nC\u2217\nSince ~ is of degree 1 in A\u2217 (Mg,n ), the coefficient of ~\u2212k in \u03c0\u2217 ([Mg,n (P1 , d)]vir \u2229\na) is an element of A2g\u22122+2d+n\u2212m\u2212k (Mg,n ).\n\n3\n\nSymmetrized Strata in M1,4\n\nThe Getzler relation [2] is a relation among two-dimensional strata on M1,4 . It\nis best written in terms of strata that have been symmetrized over the placement\nof marked points. We adopt Getzler's notation for symmetrized strata, so the\nsymbol\n\n1\n\nis shorthand for\n\n1\n= 2\n1\n\n3\n4\n1\n\n+\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 +\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n1\n\n\fwhere the line labelled 1 is an elliptic curve, the unlabelled lines are rational\ncurves and the bars represent marked points. In other words, given a stratum\nS in M1,4 , we consider the symmetrized stratum\nSym(S) =\n\nX\n1\n\u03c3(S)\nAut(S)\n\u03c3\u2208S4\n\nwhere \u03c3(S) is the action of \u03c3 on S permuting the marked points and Aut(S) is\nthe number of permutations that leave S fixed.\nGetzler's notation for the set of S4 -invariant dimension 2 strata of M1,4 is\n\n.\n\n1\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n1\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n2,2\n\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n2,3\n\n.\n..........\n..... ......... ....\n...\n......\n...\n..........\n.\n...\n.\n.\n....... ........\n.. ..........\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n1\n\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n3,4\n\n.....\n.\n...... .......... ...\n......\n...\n...\n.........\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...... ........ ..\n.......\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n0,3\n\n............\n.\n..... ......... ..\n.....\n.......\n...\n.\n...\n.\n.\n..\n...\n..\n..\n...\n...\n....\n............\n.....\n..... .......\n.\n............\n.\n.....\n.. ....\n.\n.\n. .\n\n....\n... ....\n... ..\n\n2,4\n\n.....\n.\n...... .......... ...\n......\n...\n...\n.........\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...... ........ ..\n.......\n\n0,2\n\n1\n\n0,4\n\n...........\n......\n..... .........\n.............\n...........\n.\n.\n..\n...\n.\n..\n...\n..\n..........\n............\n.\n.\n..... ......\n.........\n.... ....\n.\n.....\n.. ...\n... ..\n\na\n\nb\n\nNote tht these figures are taken from the appendix of [8].\n\n4\n\nThe Getzler Relation\n\nUsing the above notation, we may write Getzler's relation as\n12 \u25b32,2 \u22124 \u25b32,3 \u22122 \u25b32,4 +6 \u25b33,4 + \u25b30,3 + \u25b30,4 \u22122\u25b3\u03b2 = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nNote that this formula agrees with that in [2], not that in [8]. The two\ninstances differ in that in [2], the symbols \u25b3 refer to the fundamental class of\nthe stratum considered as a stack, i.e. the usual fundamental class divided by\n3\n\n\fthe order of the automorphism group of the generic point while in [8], the same\nsymbols refer to the usual fundamental class. We have found it convenient to\nuse the fundamental classes of the stack throughout.\nThe Getzler relation appear as the coefficient of ~\u22122 in \u03c0\u2217 ([M1,4 (P1 , 2)]vir \u2229\na) for a particular choice of a \u2208 A4C\u2217 ((P1 , 2)).\n\n5\n\nGroup Actions and Linearizations\n\nThe purpose of this section is to review the standard conventions for the group\naction on P1 . See [3] for more details. We define a C\u2217 action on P1 by\n\u03bb * [Z0 : Z1 ] = [\u03bbZ0 : Z1 ]\nWe identify C with P1 \u2212 [1 : 0] and refer to [0 : 1] as 0 and [1 : 0] as \u221e.\nWe will pull back point classes from P1 by the evaluation map. To perform\nthe localization computation, we need to pick equivariant extensions of the point\nclass. These equivariant extensions will arise as c1 (O(1)) for appropriate choices\nof linearization of O(1)\nIf O(\u22121) is the line bundle whose fiber over [Z0 : Z1 ] are all complex multiples of (Z0 , Z1 ), we define the linearization of O(\u22121) of weight b to be\n\u03bb * (Z0 , Z1 ) = (\u03bbb+1 Z0 , \u03bbb Z1 )\nIf i0 : 0 \u2192 P1 and i\u221e : \u221e \u2192 P1 are the usual inclusions then i0 \u2217 O(\u22121) is the\nvector space C with the action\n\u03bb * z = \u03bbb+1 z\nand i\u221e \u2217 O(\u22121) is the vector space C with the action\n\u03bb * z = \u03bbb z.\nLet O(1) be the equivariant line-bundle on P1 dual to the one defined above.\nFor b = 0, c1 (O(1)) = i0\u2217 [P ] where P is Poincare-dual to the fundamental class\nof a point. Likewise, for b = 1, c1 (O(1)) = i\u221e \u2217 [P ]. Set [0] = i\u221e \u2217 [P ] and\n[\u221e] = i\u221e \u2217 [P ]. Note that i0 \u2217 [\u221e] = 0 and i\u221e \u2217 [0] = 0.\nThe class a \u2208 A4C\u2217 (M1,4 (P1 , 2)) will be an appropriately symmetrized version\nof\na = ev1\u2217 [0]ev2\u2217 [0]ev3\u2217 [\u221e]ev4\u2217 [\u221e]\n\n6\n\nFixed Loci\n\nWe will be summing over fixed loci of the C\u2217 -action on Mg,n (P1 , d). These\nloci are given by genus g stable maps with n marked points whose irreducible\ncomponents are as follows:\n(i) Curves of any genus contracted to 0\n4\n\n\f(ii) Curves of any genus contracted to \u221e\n(iii) Rational curves mapped into P1 , ramified only over 0 and \u221e, called trivial\ncomponents\nThe marked points on the fixed loci are mapped to 0 or \u221e.\nAn example of a fixed locus in M1,4 (P1 , 2) is\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\nwhere the circle at top represents an elliptic curve contracted to 0, the 1's at the\nside are degree 1 trivial components, 1 and 2 are marked points on the elliptic\ncurve, and the 3 and 4 marked points on the trivial components.\n\n7\n\nEvaluation of Classes on Fixed Loci\n\nFollowing [5] or [3] we will compute\n\u0013\n\u0012 vir\nX\n[F ] \u2229 i\u2217F (ev1\u2217 [0]ev2\u2217 [0]ev3\u2217 [\u221e]ev4\u2217 [\u221e])\n\u03c0\u2217 iF \u2217\ne(\u03bd)\nF\n\nby parametrizing fixed loci by a product of moduli spaces. For example, the\nabove fixed locus is parametrized by M1,4 . More formally, we define a map\nI : M1,4 \u2192 M1,4 (P1 , 2)\nthat attaches degree one trivial components to the third and fourth marked\nmarked points and then places the marked points 3 and 4 on the trivial components.\n1\nI\u2217 ([M1,4 ]vir ) where deg(I) is the degree of\nSo we note that [F ]vir = deg(I)\nthe map I considered as a map of stacks which in more conventional language\nis the number of automorphisms of F divided by the number of automorphisms\nof M1,4 .

This locus\nhas NF = 2. We must determine the normal bundle to this fixed locus. This\nis done in detail in [5] and [3] so we will only give a very colloquial explanation\nhere. We can think of the normal bundle as being given by\ne(\u03bd) =\n\ne(Node Resolutions)e(Moving)\ne(Hodge)e(Structure)e(Automorphisms)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Node Resolutions denote the bundle of deformations given by resolving\nnodes, Moving, the bundle of deformations of the map from the trivial components, Hodge, the appropriate Hodge bundle, Structure, the bundle of equations\n\n10\n\n\fon deforming the map that force the map to maintain its dual graph, and Automorphisms, the bundle of automorphisms of the curve. Here,\ne(Node Resolutions) = (\u2212\u03c8ell + ~)(\u2212\u03c8rat,1 \u2212 ~)(\u2212\u03c8rat,2 \u2212 ~)\nwhere \u03c8ell is the \u03c8-class at the node on the elliptic curve and \u03c8rat,i are the\n\u03c8-classes at the nodes on the rational curve.\ne(Moving) = ((\u2212~)(~))2\ne(Hodge) = ~ \u2212 \u03bb1\nwhere \u03bb1 is the first Hodge class on the moduli of elliptic curves.\ne(Structure) = \u2212~\nwhich comes from the equation that forces the two trivial components to meet\nat the collapsed rational curve.\ne(Automorphisms) = 1\nTherefore, we get\ne(\u03bd) =\n\n(~ + \u03c8rat,1 )(~ + \u03c8rat,2 )(~ \u2212 \u03c8ell )(~4 )\n.\n(~ \u2212 \u03bb1 )(\u2212~)\n\nOn L = M1,2 \u00d7 M0,4 , the contribution is given by\n~6 (~ \u2212 \u03bb1 )~\n~6\n=\u2212\n=\u2212\ne(\u03bd)\n(~ + \u03c8rat,1 )(~ + \u03c8rat,2 )(~ \u2212 \u03c8ell )~4\n(1 +\n\n\u03bb1\n~ )\n\u03c8rat,2\n~ )(1\n\n~(1 \u2212\n\u03c8rat,1\n~ )(1\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8ell\n~ )\n\nThe coefficient of ~0 in the above is\n\u03bb1 + \u03c8rat,1 + \u03c8rat,2 \u2212 \u03c8ell\n\n(7)\n\nBy standard string equation arguments, \u03c8rat,1 and \u03c8rat,2 each force the rational\ncurve to become a two component nodal curve with two special points on each\ncomponents. Therefore, \u03c8rat,1 + \u03c8rat,2 evaluated on the above fixed locus is\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n11\n\n.\n\n\fwhere the short horizontal line is a node. In other words, this is the stratum\nparametrized by M1,2 which consists of a one-pointed elliptic curve with contracted to 0, a trivial component joining the elliptic curve to a two component\nnodal rational curve. Attached to one irreducible component of the nodal rational curve, there are two trivial component. Attached to the other component\nare two marked points mapping to \u221e. And on the preimage of the trivial\ncomponent disjoint from the elliptic curve is a marked point that maps to 0.\nThis pushes forward to 2\u25b32,3 . Since Aut(\u03c0\u2217 L) = 2 and NFun = 2, we get a\ncontribution of 8\u25b32,3 .\nOn M1,1 , \u03c8ell = \u03bb1 , so on M1,2 , \u03c8ell and \u03bb1 differ only by a correction\ngiven by the string equation. It follows that \u03c8ell \u2212 \u03bb1 on M1,2 is given by the\n1-dimensional locus where the two marked points are on a rational component\ntogether. Therefore the contribution of \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03c8ell is\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n1\n\nThis is parametrized by M1,1 \u00d7M0,4 and pushes foward to \u2212\u25b33,4 with Aut(\u03c0\u2217 L) =\n6 and NFun = 2, so we get a contribution of \u221212\u25b33,4\n\n11\n\nContributions\n\nThe result of the calculations for all the fixed locii is\n\n12\n\n\f_\n\n: \u22124 \u25b32,4\n\n_\n\n: \u221212 \u25b33,4 +8 \u25b32,3\n\n_\n\n: 8 \u25b32,3 +8 \u25b32,4\n\n0,2\n\n1,1\n\n2,0\n\n8\n\u22a4 : \u2212 \u25b30,2 \u221264 \u25b32,3 \u221264 \u25b32,4\n3\nY\n: 8 \u25b32,2 +20 \u25b32,3 +24 \u25b32,4 + \u25b30,2\n2,0\n\nY\n\n5\n: 16 \u25b32,2 +20 \u25b32,3 +32 \u25b32,4 +24 \u25b33,4 + \u25b30,2 +2 \u25b30,3 +2 \u25b30,4\n3\n\n^\n\n: \u22124 \u25b32,4\n\n^\n\n: \u221212 \u25b33,4 +8 \u25b32,3\n\n^\n\n: 8 \u25b32,3 +8 \u25b32,4\n\n1,1\n\n0,2\n\n1,1\n\n2,0\n\n8\n\u22a5 : \u2212 \u25b30,2 \u221264 \u25b32,3 \u221264 \u25b32,4\n3\na\n: 8 \u25b32,2 +20 \u25b32,3 +24 \u25b32,4 + \u25b30,2\n2,0\n\na\n1,1\n\nO\n\n5\n: 16 \u25b32,2 +20 \u25b32,3 +32 \u25b32,4 +24 \u25b33,4 + \u25b30,2 +2 \u25b30,3 +2 \u25b30,4\n3\n: \u22128\u25b3b\n\nTheir sum is\n4(12 \u25b32,2 \u22124 \u25b32,3 \u22122 \u25b32,4 +6 \u25b33,4 + \u25b30,3 + \u25b30,4 \u22122\u25b3b ) = 0.\nThis is the Getzler relation.\n\n12\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above method can be generalized and systematized in many directions. An\nobvious question is to apply this method to derive the Belorousski-Pandharipande\nrelation on M2,3 . Another question are to systematize this method so that the\ncomputation can be done by a computer or can be expressed in terms of a Feynman expansion of an integral. A humbler version of the above is to prove that\nthere are non-trivial relations by automating the computation of the leading\n13\n\n\fterms (the symbol) of such relations. One also would like to study the structure\nof such relations. It is likely that much work will be done along these lines by\nusing localization and degeneration methods in conjunction as in [1] and [7].\n\nReferences\n[1] C. Faber and R. Pandharipande.
