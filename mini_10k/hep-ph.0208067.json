The current experimental excess\nis either 1.5\u03c3 or 3.2\u03c3 depending on whether e+ e\u2212 or \u03c4 -decay data are used in the\ntheoretical calculations for the leading order hadronic processes. Neither result\nis compelling evidence for new physics. However, if one interprets the excess as\ncoming from supersymmetry, one can obtain upper mass bounds on many of the\nparticles of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Within this\nframework we provide a general analysis of the lightest masses as a function of the\ndeviation so that future changes in either experimental data or theoretical calculations can easily be translated into upper bounds at the desired level of statistical\nsignificance. In addition, we give specific bounds on sparticle masses in light of\nthe latest experimental and theoretical calculations for the MSSM with universal\nslepton masses, with and without universal gaugino masses.\n\n\fIn February 2001 the Brookhaven E821 experiment [1] reported evidence for a deviation of the muon magnetic moment, a\u03bc , from the Standard Model expectation of about\n2.7\u03c3. Immediately following that announcement appeared a number of papers analyzing\nthe reported excess in terms of various forms of new physics, including supersymmetry\n(SUSY) [2, 3, 4, 5]. Shortly thereafter, errors in the theoretical calculation of the magnetic moment within the Standard Model were discovered. In particular, the sign of\nthe light-by-light hadronic contribution to a\u03bc was found to be in error [6], shifting the\ntheoretical value by roughly 17 \u00d7 10\u221210 in the direction of the E821 data. The resulting\ndiscrepancy between data and theory was then only about 1.6\u03c3, leaving little indication\nof new physics.\nSince that initial rise and ebb of interest in a\u03bc , there has been progress both theoretically and experimentally. On the theory side, besides the recalculation of the lightby-light scattering, there have also appeared new calculations of the other hadronic\ncontributions to a\u03bc [7, 8, 9, 10]. On the experimental front, E821 has announced [11]\nan updated measurement of a\u03bc using a data set four times larger than that analyzed\nin Ref. [1]. From their combined data sets, they obtain a world average for a\u03bc slightly\nhigher than their previous measurement, but with significantly smaller errors. These\nvarious developments have now placed the discrepancy between experiment and theory\nin the range 1.5\u03c3 to 3.2\u03c3.\nThe current deviation of E821's measurement from the Standard Model provides no\ncompelling evidence in favor of new physics. However, the attention paid to this process\nover the last year warrants a re-examination of the bounds that can be placed on new\nphysics by the current data, in particular, on new SUSY particles. If the small deviation\nin a\u03bc is a sign for new physics, then the SUSY explanation is, for many of us, the most\nexciting of the various proposals, since it implies SUSY at a mass scale not far above the\nweak scale. In particular, it implies a light slepton and a light gaugino, though \"light\"\ncan still be as heavy as many hundred GeV.\nThis paper plays two roles. First and more importantly, we present general bounds\non the spectrum of SUSY masses for any deviation of the muon magnetic moment from\nthe theoretical Standard Model value. Any changes in the Standard Model calculation\nor to the data itself will not affect this general analysis; when new data or calculations\nappear, revised bounds can simply be read off the plots contained here. Second, we will\ndetermine specific 1\u03c3 upper bounds on SUSY states in light of the most recent E821\ndata and the latest theoretical calculations.\nThe existence of these bounds will rely on very simple and clearly stated assumptions\nabout the SUSY particle spectrum; these assumptions will not include a fine-tunimg\nconstraints.\n\n1\n\n\fSUSY and a\u03bc\n\n1\n\nThe measurement performed by the E821 collaboration is of the muon's anomalous\nmagnetic moment 1 , which is to say, the coefficient a\u03bc of the non-renormalizable operator\na\u03bc\n\u03c8 \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8F\u03b1\u03b2 .\n2m\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nWithin the Standard Model, a\u03bc receives contributions from QED, electroweak and\nhadronic processes, the latter usually separated into contributions from vacuum polarization and light-by-light scattering. While the QED and electroweak contributions\nare well understood, the hadronic calculations are under scrutiny and require experimental input. For the purposes of this paper we will use the most recent determination\nof the hadronic contributions available.\nThe QED and electroweak contributions to a\u03bc are known:\naQED\n= 11 658 470.56 (0.29)\n\u03bc\n\n[13]\n\naEW\n\u03bc\n\n[14]\n\n=\n\n15.2 (0.1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we are expressing a\u03bc in units of 10\u221210 . In the hadronic sector, the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) contributions have been known for several years, while the and light-bylight (LBL) contributions have been updated in the last year:\naHad,NLO\n= \u221210.0 (0.6)\n\u03bc\n\naHad,LBL\n\u03bc\n\n=\n\n8.0 (4.0)\n\n[15]\n[6].\n\n(3)\n\nThe calculation of leading order (LO) hadronic contributions requires input from experiment. Davier et al. [9] have calculated the LO hadronic pieces using e+ e\u2212 scattering\ndata and alternatively with a combination of e+ e\u2212 and \u03c4 -decay data. They find:\naHad,LO\n\u03bc\n\n=\n\n(\n\n684.7 (7.0) (no \u03c4 data)\n701.9 (6.2) (\u03c4 data).\n\n(4)\n\nHagiwara et al. have also calculated the LO hadronic contribution without the \u03c4 data\nin Ref. [10]:\naHad,LO\n= 683.1 (6.2) (no \u03c4 data)\n(5)\n\u03bc\nwhich is consistent with the above evaluation. For our estimate of a\u03bc without \u03c4 data\nwe will use the average of the two results stated above and the larger error. Adding the\ncontributions gives the standard model prediction for a\u03bc :\na\u03bc =\n1\n\n(\n\n11 659 167.7 (8.1) (no \u03c4 data)\n11 659 185.7 (7.4) (\u03c4 data).\n\nSee, however Ref.

Thus, the\ndeviation is either 3.2\u03c3 or 1.5\u03c3, depending on whether or not the \u03c4 data is used. In the\nanalysis that follows, we present results using both values of \u03b4a\u03bc from Eq. (8).\nThe SUSY contributions to a\u03bc have been known since the early days of SUSY and\nhave become more complete with time[16]. In this paper we will follow the notation\nof Ref. [4] which has the advantage of using the standard conventions of Haber and\nKane [17]; any convention which we do not define here can be found in either of these\ntwo papers.\nPrior to the revision of the theoretical calculations and the release of the newest E821\ndata, there were a number of analyses in the context of SUSY [2, 3, 4, 5]. The present\nauthors also presented an analysis of the full minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(MSSM) with and without gaugino unification and neutralino LSP constraints [18].\n\n1.1\n\nThe diagrams\n\nIn the mass eigenbasis, there are only two one-loop SUSY diagrams which contribute\nto a\u03bc , shown in Figure 1. The first has an internal loop of smuons and neutralinos, the\nsecond a loop of sneutrinos and charginos. But the charginos, neutralinos and even the\nsmuons are themselves admixtures of various interaction eigenstates and we can better\nunderstand the physics involved by working in terms of these interaction diagrams, of\nwhich there are many more than two. We can easily separate the leading and sub-leading\ndiagrams in the interaction eigenbasis by a few simple observations.\nFirst, the magnetic moment operator is a helicity-flipping interaction. Thus any\ndiagram which contributes to a\u03bc must involve a helicity flip somewhere along the fermion\n3\n\n\fcurrent. This automatically divides the diagrams into two classes: those with helicity\nflips on the external legs and those with flips on an internal line. For those in the first\nclass, the amplitude must scale as m\u03bc ; for those in the second, the amplitudes can scale\ninstead by mSUSY , where mSUSY represents the mass of the internal SUSY fermion (a\nchargino or neutralino). Since mSUSY \u226b m\u03bc , it is the latter class that will typically\ndominate the SUSY contribution to a\u03bc . Therefore we will restrict further discussion to\nthis latter class of diagrams alone.\nSecondly, the interaction of the neutralinos and charginos with the (s)muons and\nsneutrinos occurs either through their higgsino or gaugino components. Thus each vertex implies a factor of either y\u03bc (the muon Yukawa coupling) or g (the weak and/or\nhypercharge gauge coupling). Given two vertices, the diagrams therefore scale as y\u03bc2 ,\ngy\u03bc or g 2. In the Standard Model, y\u03bc is smaller than g by roughly 10\u22123 . In the minimal\nSUSY standard model (MSSM) at low tan \u03b2, this ratio is essentially unchanged, but\nbecause y\u03bc scales as 1/ cos \u03b2, at large tan \u03b2 (\u223c 60) the ratio can be reduced to roughly\n10\u22121 . Thus we can safely drop the y\u03bc2 contributions from our discussions, but at large\ntan \u03b2 we must preserve the gy\u03bc pieces as well as the g 2 pieces.2\nThe pieces that we will keep are therefore shown in Figures 2.

We can reproduce their result in a simple way\nbecause the B\u0303 B\u0303 contribution has a calculable upper bound at which the smuons mix at\n45\u25e6 , m\u03bc\u03031 \u226a m\u03bc\u03032 , and m\u00d11 \u226a m\u00d12,3,4 with \u00d11 = B\u0303.

Though any real model will clearly suppress this contribution\nsomewhat, this is still 102 times larger than needed experimentally.\nThis pure B\u0303 B\u0303 scenario is actually an experimental worst-case, particularly for hadron\ncolliders. The only sparticles that are required to be light are a single neutralino (which\nis probably B\u0303-like) and a single \u03bc\u0303. The neutralino is difficult to produce, and if stable,\nimpossible to detect directly. The neutralino could be indirectly observed in the decay of\nthe \u03bc\u0303 as missing energy, but production of a \u03bc\u0303 at a hadron machine is highly suppressed.\nIn the worst of all possible worlds, E821 could be explained by only these two light\nsparticles, with the rest of the SUSY spectrum hiding above a TeV. Further, even the\n\"light\" sparticles can be too heavy to produce at a 500 GeV linear collider. While this\n5\n\n\fcase is in no way generic, it demonstrates that the E821 excess does not provide any\nsort of no-lose theorem (even at 1\u03c3) for the Tevatron, the LHC or the NLC.\nThis raises an important experimental question: how many of the MSSM states must\nbe \"light\" in order to explain the E821 data? In the worst-case, it would appear to be\nonly two. Even in the more optimistic scenario in which the chargino diagram dominates\n\u03b4a\u03bc , the answer naively appears to be two: a single chargino and a single sneutrino.

The mass spectrum of these 9 sparticles is\ndetermined entirely by 7 parameters in the MSSM: 2 soft slepton masses(mL , mR ), 2\ngaugino masses (M1 , M2 ), the \u03bc-term, a soft trilinear slepton coupling (A\u03bc\u0303 ) and finally\ntan \u03b2. Of these, A\u03bc\u0303 plays almost no role at all and so we leave it out of our discussions\n(see the appendix). And in some well-motivated SUSY-breaking scenarios, M1 and M2\nare also correlated. Thus there are either 5 or 6 parameters responsible for setting 9\nsparticle masses. There are clearly non-trivial correlations among the masses which can\nbe exploited in setting mass limits on the sparticles.\nFirst, there are well-known correlations between the chargino and neutralino masses;\nfor example, a light charged C\u0303i \u223c W\u0303 implies a light neutral \u00d1j \u223c W\u0303 and vice-versa.\nThere are also correlations in mixed systems (i.e., the neutralinos, charginos and\nsmuons) between the masses of the eigenstates and the size of their mixings. Consider\nthe case of the smuons in particular; their mass matrix is given in the appendix. On\ndiagonalizing, the left-right smuon mixing angle is given simply by:\ntan 2\u03b8\u03bc\u0303 \u2243\n\n2m\u03bc \u03bc tan \u03b2\n.\nML2 \u2212 MR2\n\n(13)\n\nThe chargino contribution is maximized for large smuon mixing and large mixing occurs\nwhen the numerator is of order or greater than the denominator; since the former is\nsuppressed by m\u03bc , one must compensate by having either a very large \u03bc-term in the\nnumerator or nearly equal ML and MR in the denominator, both of which have profound\nimpacts on the spectrum.\nThere is one more correlation/constraint that we feel is natural to impose on the\nMSSM spectrum: slepton mass universality. It is well-known that the most general\nversion of the MSSM produces huge flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) unless\nsome external order is placed on the MSSM spectrum. By far, the simplest such order is\n6\n\n\ffor sparticles with the same gauge quantum numbers to be degenerate. This requirement\nis most stringent in the squark sector, but also holds in the slepton sector due to nonobservation of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. In any case, mechanisms which generate degeneracy\nin the squarks usually do so among the sleptons as well. Thus we assume m\u03c4\u0303L = m\u03bc\u0303L \u2261\nmL and m\u03c4\u0303R = m\u03bc\u0303R \u2261 mR . Then the mass matrix for the stau sector is identical to\nthat of the smuons with the replacement m\u03bc \u2192 m\u03c4 in the off-diagonal elements. This\nenhancement of the mixing in the stau sector by m\u03c4 /m\u03bc \u2243 17 implies that m\u03c4\u03031 < m\u03bc\u03031 .\nIn particular, if\nML2 MR2 < m2\u03c4 \u03bc2 tan2 \u03b2\n(14)\nthen m2\u03c4\u03031 < 0 and QED will be broken by a stau vev. Given slepton universality, this\nimposes a constraint on the smuon mass matrix:\nML2 MR2\n\n>\n\nm\u03c4\nm\u03bc\n\n!2\n\nm2\u03bc \u03bc2 tan2 \u03b2\n\n(15)\n\n2ML MR\nML2 \u2212 MR2\n\n(16)\n\nor on the smuon mixing angle:\nm\u03bc\ntan 2\u03b8\u03bc\u0303 <\nm\u03c4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n2\nwhere ML,R are the positive roots of ML,R\n. While not eliminating the possibility of\n\u03b8\u03bc\u0303 \u2243 45\u25e6 , this formula shows that a fine-tuning of at least 1 part in 17 is needed to\nobtain O(1) mixing. We will not apply any kind of fine-tuning criterion to our analysis,\nyet we will find that this slepton mass universality constraint sharply reduces the upper\nbounds on slepton masses which we are able to find in our study of points in MSSM\nparameter space.\n(As an aside, if one assumes slepton mass universality at some SUSY-breaking messenger scale above the weak scale, Yukawa-induced corrections will break universality by\ndriving the stau masses down. This effect would further tighten our bounds on smuon\nmasses and mixings.)\nThe above discussion has an especially large impact on the worst-case scenario in\nwhich the B\u0303 B\u0303 contributions dominates \u03b4a\u03bc . For generic points in MSSM parameter\n< 1/17 which reduces the size of the B\u0303 B\u0303 contribution\nspace, one expects that tan 2\u03b8\u03bc\u0303 \u223c\nby a factor of 17. As a byproduct, the masses required for explaining the E821 anomaly\nare pushed back toward the experimentally accessible region.\n\n2\n\nNumerical results\n\nNow that we have established the basic principle of our analysis, we will carry it out in\ndetail. We will concentrate on three basic cases. The first case is the one most often\nconsidered in the literature: gaugino mass unification. Here one assumes that the weakscale gaugino mass parameters (M1 and M2 ) are equal at the same scale at which the\ngauge couplings unify. This implies that at the weak scale M1 = (5/3)(\u03b11/\u03b12 )M2 . The\n7\n\n\fsecond case we consider is identical to the first with the added requirement that the\nlightest SUSY sparticle (LSP) be a neutralino. This requirement is motivated by the\ndesire to explain astrophysical dark matter by a stable LSP. Finally we will also consider\nthe most general case in which all relevant SUSY parameters are left free independent\nof each other; we will refer to this as the \"general MSSM\" case.\nThe basic methodology is simple: we put down a logarithmic grid on the space of\nMSSM parameters (M1 , M2 , mL , mR and \u03bc) for several choices of tan \u03b2. The grid\nextends from 10 GeV for M1 , M2 and \u03bc, and from 50 GeV for mL,R , up to 2 TeV for all\nmass parameters. For the case in which gaugino unification is imposed M2 is no longer\na free parameter and our grid contains 108 points. For the general MSSM case our grid\ncontains 3 \u00d7 109 points. Only \u03bc > 0 is considered since that maximizes the value of \u03b4a\u03bc .\nFinally, for our limits on tan \u03b2 we used an adaptive mesh routine which did a better job\nof maximizing \u03b4a\u03bc over the space of MSSM inputs. By running with grids of varying\nresolutions and offsets we estimate the error on our mass bounds to be less than \u00b15%.\n\n2.1\n\nBounds on the lightest sparticles\n\nPerhaps the most important information that can be garnered from the E821 data is\nan upper bound on the scale of sparticle masses. In particular, one can place upper\nbounds on the masses of the lightest sparticle(s) as a function of \u03b4a\u03bc . Here we will\nderive bounds on the lightest slepton and chargino, but we will also derive bounds on\nthe lightest several sparticles, independent of their identity.\nThese bounds on additional light sparticles provide an important lesson. Without\nthem there remains the very real possibility that the E821 data is explained by a pair of\nlight sparticles and that the remaining SUSY spectrum is out of reach experimentally.\nBut our additional bounds will give us some indication not only of where we can find\nSUSY, but also of how much information we might be able to extract about the fundamental parameters of SUSY - the more sparticles we detect and measure, the more\ninformation we will have for disentangling the soft-breaking sector of the MSSM.\nIn Fig. 3 we have shown the upper mass bounds for the lightest four sparticles\nassuming gaugino mass unification. These bounds are not bounds on individual species\nof sparticles (which will come in the next section and always be larger than these bounds)\nbut simply bounds on whatever sparticle happens to be lightest. The important points\nto note are: (i) the maximum values of the mass correspond to the largest value of tan \u03b2,\nwhich is to be expected given dominance of the chargino diagram at large tan \u03b2; (ii)\nthe 1\u03c3 limit without (with) the \u03c4 data requires at least 2 sparticles to lie below roughly\n490 (990) GeV; (iii) for the central value of the E821 data, at least 4 sparticles must lie\nbelow 585 (915) GeV; and (iv) for low values of tan \u03b2 a maximum value of \u03b4a\u03bc is reached\n(we will return to this later).\nThe same plots could be produced with the additional assumption that the LSP be\na neutralino, but we will only show the case for the LSP bound, in Fig. 4.

The dotted lines assume gaugino unification only while the solid lines require additionally\nthat the LSP is a neutralino. The dashed line is the bound in the general MSSM, calculated\nat tan \u03b2 = 50.\n\ngeneral case discussed above (i.e., they match the lines in the tan \u03b2 = 50 plot of Fig. 3).\n> 40 \u00d7 10\u221210 there is little difference between the cases with and\nNotice that for \u03b4a\u03bc \u223c\nwithout a neutralino LSP. At the extreme upper and lower values of tan \u03b2 there is also\nlittle difference. It is only for the intermediate values of tan \u03b2 that the mass bound shifts\nappreciably; for tan \u03b2 = 10 it comes down by as much as 50 GeV when one imposes a\nneutralino LSP.\nFinally, we consider the most general MSSM case, i.e., without gaugino unification.\nHere the correlations are much less pronounced, but interesting bounds still exist. For\nexample the central value of the E821 data still demands at least 3 sparticles below\n525 (770) GeV. In figure 5 we demonstrate this explicitly by plotting the masses of\nthe four lightest sparticles for tan \u03b2 = 50 and a wide range of \u03b4a\u03bc . (We also plot\nthe mass bound on the LSP in Fig. 4 with the label \"General MSSM.\") We see that\ndropping the gaugino unification requirement has one primary effect: the mass of the\nLSP is significantly increased. This is because the LSP in the unified case is usually\na \u00d11 \u223c B\u0303 but isn't itself responsible for generating \u03b4a\u03bc . In the general case, the LSP\nmust participate in \u03b4a\u03bc (otherwise its mass could be arbitrarily large) and so is roughly\nthe mass of the second lightest sparticle in the unified case, whether that be a \u03bc\u0303 or\nC\u0303. Otherwise the differences between the more general MSSM and the gaugino unified\nMSSM are small.\nWe have summarized all this data on the LSP in Table 1 where we have shown the\nmass bounds using the 1\u03c3 limit of the E821 data on the LSP for various tan \u03b2 values\n10\n\n\f1000\n\nMasses [GeV]\n\n750\n\n500\n\n250\n\nGeneral MSSM\nGaugino unif.\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n\u03b4a\u03bc x 10\n\nFigure 5: Bounds on the masses of the four lightest sparticles as a function of \u03b4a\u03bc for tan \u03b2 = 50.\nThe dotted lines assume gaugino unification only while the solid lines are for the general MSSM.\n\nwith our various assumptions.

But perhaps of equal importance are the bounds on the next 2 lightest sparticles\n(the \"2LSP\" and \"3LSP\"): Using a\u03bc calculated without \u03c4 -decay data, m2LSP < 485 GeV\nand m3LSP < 630 GeV; for the value of a\u03bc calculated with the \u03c4 data, m2LSP < 1 TeV,\nwhile m3LSP is pushed somewhat above 1 TeV. Note that the bound on the 2LSP is\nessentially identical to that on the LSP.

Another important piece of information that can be\nprovided by this analysis is bounds on individual species of sparticles, for example, on\nthe charginos or on the smuons. These bounds will of necessity be higher than those\nderived in the previous section, but still provide important information about how and\nwhere to look for SUSY. In particular, they can help us gauge the likelihood of finding\nSUSY at Run II of the Tevatron or at the LHC.\nThere is one complication in obtaining these bounds. At low tan \u03b2 the data is most\neasily explained by the neutralino diagrams and as such there must be at least one\nlight smuon and one light neutralino. At larger tan \u03b2 contributions from the chargino\ndiagrams dominate, implying a light chargino and sneutrino. However the correlations\nalready discussed preserve the bounds on the various species over the whole range of\ntan \u03b2. A bound on m\u03bd\u0303 implies a bound on m\u03bc\u03031 , and a bound on mC\u03031 implies a bound on\nat least one of the m\u00d1i , and in certain cases (such as gaugino unification), the converses\nmay be true as well.\nWe have shown in Fig. 6 the mass bounds on \u03bc\u03031 and \u00d11 under the assumption of gaugino unification; a plot for C\u03031 /\u00d12 will appear later in our discussion of Tevatron physics.\nNote that \u00d11 must lie below 500 (950) GeV, even for large tan \u03b2, thanks to the gaugino\nunification condition, while \u03bc\u03031 can be heavier but must still lie below 915 (1800) GeV at\n1\u03c3.\nFinally, we can consider the general MSSM without gaugino unification. The results\nare shown schematically in Fig. 7 where the general MSSM bounds (solid lines) are\nshown alongside the gaugino unification bounds (dashed lines).\nWe can see from the figure that the bound on the \u03bc\u03031 is essentially identical to that\nin the gaugino unification picture.

The two lines for the \u03bc\u03031\nessentially overlap.\n\nreason is no mystery. Once again, the lightest neutralino is no longer a B\u0303-like spectator\nto the magnetic moment, but is a W\u0303 -like partner of a participating W\u0303 -like chargino.\nThe results of these plots for the current discrepancy are summarized as follows. For\nthe MSSM with gaugino unification, the lightest neutralino must fall below 500 (950) GeV\nfor a 1\u03c3 deviation. The lighter smuon must lie below 915 GeV (1.8 TeV). Without the\n\u03c4 -decay data, the lighter chargino falls below 890 GeV; using the \u03c4 data, the bound rises\nabove 2 TeV.\nFor the worst case, the general MSSM, the smuon bound increases by only about\n50 GeV over the gaugino unification limits and the neutralino bounds increase to 890 GeV\n(over 1 TeV), only slightly higher than the unified case. However, the bounds on the\nlighter chargino jump above 2 TeV.\n\n2.3\n\nBounds on tan \u03b2\n\nThe final bound we will investigate using the E821 data is on tan \u03b2. There had been,\nafter the appearance of the original E821 data, some discussion in the literature about\nwhich values of tan \u03b2 were capable of explaining it. In particular, at lower tan \u03b2 there\nis a real suppression in the maximum size of \u03b4a\u03bc . In Figure 8 we have shown the\nmaximum attainable value of \u03b4a\u03bc as a function of tan \u03b2 in the general MSSM; adding\nthe assumption of gaugino unification changes the figure only slightly.\nThe limit in Fig. 8 clearly divides into two regions.

The dotted lines\nrepresent the 1\u03c3 limits, without (with) the inclusion of the \u03c4 decay data.\n\ncontribution dominates and thus \u03b4a\u03bc \u221d y\u03bc , scaling linearly with tan \u03b2. At lower \u03b4a\u03bc ,\nhowever, both neutralino and chargino contributions can be important so it becomes\npossible to generate \u03b4a\u03bc with much smaller values of tan \u03b2 than would be possible from\nthe charginos alone. The E821 data does not therefore imply any bound on tan \u03b2 whatsoever, neither at 1\u03c3 nor at the experimental central value. Further reductions in the\nsize of the error bars will not change this result, so long as the central value remains at\nor below its current 1\u03c3 upper bound.\n\n2.4\n\nImplications for the Tevatron\n\nAt its simplest level, the measurement of \u03b4a\u03bc , an anomaly in the lepton sector, has little\nimpact on the Tevatron, a hadron machine. In particular, the light smuons associated\nwith \u03b4a\u03bc cannot be directly produced at the Tevatron, occurring only if heavier nonleptonic states are produced which then decay to sleptons. In the calculation of a\u03bc ,\nthe only such sparticles are the neutralinos and charginos. These states can be copiously produced and in fact form the initial state for the \"gold-plated\" SUSY trilepton\nsignature.\nOf particular interest for the trilepton signature are the masses of the lighter chargino\n(C\u03031 ) and 2nd lightest neutralino (\u00d12 ). Studies of mSUGRA parameter space indicate that the sensitivity to the trilepton signature at Run II/III of the Tevatron depends strongly on the mass of sleptons which can appear in the gaugino decay chains.\nFor heavy sleptons, the Tevatron is only sensitive to gaugino masses in the range [20]\n< 130 to 140 GeV for 10 fb\u22121 of luminosity and 145 to 155 GeV for 30 fb\u22121 , where\nmC\u03031 ,\u00d12 \u223c\n14\n\n\f~ ~\nMass of {C1 , N2 } [GeV]\n\n800\n\n600\ntan\u03b2\n\n= 50\n\n400\n30\n\n10\n\n200\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u03b4a\u03bc x 10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\nFigure 9: Mass bounds on C\u03031 and \u00d12 (where mC\u03031 \u2243 m\u00d12 ) as a function of \u03b4a\u03bc for tan \u03b2 = 3,\n5, 10, 30 and 50. The dotted lines represent the 1\u03c3 bounds without (with) the inclusion of the\n\u03c4 decay data. This figure assumes gaugino unification and a neutralino LSP.\n\nthe quoted ranges take one from low to high tan \u03b2. However, for light sleptons (below\nabout 200 GeV) the range is considerably extended, up to gaugino masses around 190\nto 210 GeV.\nIt is impossible in the kind of analysis presented here to comment on the expected\ncross-sections for the neutralino-chargino production (for example, there is no information in a\u03bc on the masses of the t-channel squarks) but we can examine the mass bounds\non C\u03031 and \u00d12 . In Fig. 9 we have shown just that: the upper bound on the heavier of\neither C\u03031 or \u00d12 as a function of \u03b4a\u03bc for several values of tan \u03b2.\nA few comments are in order on the figure. First, this figure assumes gaugino unification; dropping that assumption can lead to significantly heavier and unequal masses for\nthe \u00d12 and C\u03031 . Second, we have also assumed a neutralino LSP; this is to be expected\nsince the event topology for the trilepton signal assumes a stable, neutralino LSP. Finally, on the y-axis is actually plotted mC\u03031 , but in every case we examined with gaugino\nunification, the difference in the maximum masses of C\u03031 and \u00d12 differed by at most a\nfew GeV. This is because they are both dominantly wino-like in the unified case and\nthus have masses \u2243 M2 .\nFrom the figure it is clear that one cannot devise a no-lose theorem for the Tevatron\nfrom current E821 data. However, if tan \u03b2 is small and \u03b4a\u03bc \u2265 35 \u00d7 10\u221210 (the current\ncentral value using only e+ e\u2212 data) then the gauginos may be within the Tevatron's\nreach. We must also emphasize that these are upper bounds on the sparticle masses and\nin no way represent best fits or preferred values. Thus, for small tan \u03b2, there is reason\nto hope that the Tevatron will be able to probe the gaugino sector in Run II or III; for\n15\n\n\fNumber of sparticles below 250 GeV\n\n6\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n3\n\n0\n\n30\n\n10\n10\n\n3\n\n0\n\n3\n\n10\n\n30\n\n20\n\n30\n\n\u03b4a\u03bc x 10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n30\n\n50\n\n50\n\n10\n\n\u221a\nFigure 10: Minimum number of sparticles directly observable at a s = 500 GeV linear collider\nas a function of \u03b4a\u03bc . The bars represent tan \u03b2 = 3, 10, 30 and 50. This graph assumes gaugino\nunification but does not include additional sleptons implied by slepton mass universality.\n\nlarger tan \u03b2 there is little information about SUSY at the Tevatron to be garnered from\na\u03bc .\n\n2.5\n\nImplications for a Linear Collider\n\n\u221a\nA consensus has emerged in favor of building a s = 500 GeV linear collider, presumably\na factory for sparticles with masses below 250 GeV. What\n\u221a does the measurement of a\u03bc\ntell us with regards to our chances for seeing SUSY at s = 500 GeV? And how many\nsparticles will be actually accessible to such a collider?\nThe analysis of the previous section can put a lower bound on the number of observable sparticles at a linear collider as a function of \u03b4a\u03bc and tan \u03b2 and we show those\nnumbers as a histogram in Fig. 10. In this figure, we have shown the minimum number\nof sparticles with mass below 250 GeV for tan \u03b2 = 3, 10, 30 and 50, assuming gaugino\nunification. In the graph, the thinner bars represent smaller tan \u03b2. As is to be expected,\nthe number of light states increases with increasing \u03b4a\u03bc and with decreasing tan \u03b2. However note that there are no tan \u03b2 = 3 lines for \u03b4a\u03bc \u2265 40 \u00d7 10\u221210 since there is no way to\nexplain such large \u03b4a\u03bc values at low tan \u03b2.\nWe see from the figure that at low tan \u03b2, there is a 1\u03c3 \"guarantee\" that at least\n1 to 4 sparticles will be produced at a 500 GeV linear collider, depending on whether\nthe \u03c4 -decay is used. This counting does not include extra sleptons due to slepton mass\nuniversality; for example, a light muon sneutrino also implies light tau and electron\n> 30 there is\nsneutrinos, and likewise for the charged smuon. We see also that for tan \u03b2 \u223c\n16\n\n\fno such guarantee that a 500 GeV machine would produce on-shell sparticles; this is not\nto be taken to mean that one should not expect their production, simply that a\u03bc cannot\nguarantee it.\nA similar bar graph can also be made for a 1 TeV machine, though we do not show\nit here. However the relevant numbers can be inferred from Fig. 3.\nNote that any particular class of models, such as gravity- or gauge-mediated SUSYbreaking, may not saturate the bounds presented here. That is, other constraints may\nrule out all regions of parameter space in which \u03b4a\u03bc exceeds some maximum value.\nHowever if a model does allow a particular value of \u03b4a\u03bc , then pursuant to the conditions\ndiscussed here, that model must have at least as many light particles as the number\ngiven above.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nDeviations in the muon anomalous magnetic moment have long been advertised as a\nkey hunting ground for indirect signatures of SUSY. However, the current experimental\nexcess is too small, given the large theoretical uncertainties, to provide statistically\nsignificant evidence for SUSY.\nThe most recent Standard Model calculations indicate an excess of either 1.5\u03c3 or\n3.2\u03c3. If one were to accept the E821 anomaly as evidence for SUSY (at either of these\nvalues), then a number of statements can be inferred at the 1\u03c3 confidence level:\n\u2022 The lightest sparticle must lie below 475 GeV (1 TeV);\n\u2022 For models with unified gaugino masses, there must be at least 2 sparticles with\nmasses below 585 GeV (1 TeV);\n\u2022 There is no lower bound on tan \u03b2.\nBounds on individual species of sparticles are weaker, usually falling at or above 1 TeV.\nHowever, these pessimistic bounds are over all tan \u03b2, which means effectively that\nthey are the bounds when tan \u03b2 = 50, the maximum value we considered. For low\ntan \u03b2, the bounds on sparticle masses are much smaller. At tan \u03b2 = 3 and with gaugino\nunification and a neutralino LSP, there must be a sparticle below 115 (215) GeV, within\nthe range accessible in the very near future. So, while the bounds placed on SUSY by a\u03bc\nare relatively weak when no constraints are placed on the MSSM, constraining the model\nby demanding gaugino unification or low(er) tan \u03b2 can bring down the mass bounds into\nthe experimentally interesting region.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to S.
