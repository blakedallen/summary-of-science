Introduction: Drop Impact on Solid Surfaces\nDrops impacting onto solid surfaces are important for a large number of applications:\nfor instance, almost all spray coating and deposition processes rely ultimately on the\ninteraction of a droplet with a surface. A large variety of phenomena can be present\nduring drop impacts, from splashes to spreading, and from large wave surface deformation\nto rebound (see (Rein 1993) and references therein).\nResearch on drop impacts has a long history, starting with the pioneering studies of\nWorthington and later on with the famous photographs of Edgerton(Worthington 1876;\nEdgerton & Killian 1954). Most of the previous work on drop impact focused on determining the maximum diameter a drop is capable of covering upon impact (Fukai et al.\n1993; Roisman et al. 2002; Clanet et al. 2004). However, the practical problem of deposition can be very different if one wants to efficiently deposit some material on the surface.\nThis is especially grave when the surface is not wetted by the liquid, as is illustrated\nby the high-speed video pictures in Fig.1 for the impact of a water droplet. It can be\nobserved that the drop expands rapidly, due to the large speed with which it arrives at\nthe surface. However, due to the hydrophobicity of the surface, subsequently the drop\nretracts violently, leading to the ejection of part of the droplet from the surface: we observe droplet rebound. It is this \"rebound\" that is the limiting factor for deposition in\nmany applications, for instance for the deposition of pesticide solutions on hydrophobic\nplant leaves (Bergeron et al. 2000). We study here the impact and subsequent retraction\nof aqueous drops onto a hydrophobic surface, and seek to understand the dynamics of\nexpansion and retraction of the droplets.\n\n\f2\n\nDenis Bartolo, Christophe Josserand and Daniel Bonn\n\nFigure 1. Temporal evolution of the contact radius of droplets upon impact and retraction.\nThe radii are normalized by those of the spherical droplets before impact. The pictures show\nthe shape of the droplets at the different stages of retraction. Droplet radius is 1 mm, impact\nspeed is 2 m * s\u22121 : a) pure water, b) viscous water-glycerol mixture, viscosity 50 mPa * s.\n\nIn general, these problems are difficult because for most practical and laboratory situations, three forces play an important role: the capillarity and viscous forces, and the\ninertia of the droplets. We try and disentangle the effects of the three forces here by\nperforming systematic experiments, varying both the importance of viscous and inertial\nforces.\nWe provide experimental evidence for the existence of two distinct retraction regimes.\nIn both regimes, capillary forces are the motor behind the droplet retraction, and are,\nfor the first regime countered by inertial forces. In the second regime the main force\nslowing down the retraction is viscous. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, the drop\n\n\fDrop Retraction upon impact\n\n3\n\nretraction rate (the retraction speed divided by the maximum radius) does not depend on\nthe impact velocity for strong enough impacts. The dimensionless number\nthat governs\n\u221a\nthe retraction rate is found to be the Ohnesorge number, Oh = \u03b7/ \u03c1RI \u03b3, with \u03b7 the\nviscosity, \u03c1 the liquid density, RI the impacting drop radius, and \u03b3 the surface tension.\nThe Ohnesorge number therefore compares the dissipative (viscous) forces to the nondissipative (capillary and inertial) forces. The crossover between the two regimes is found\nto happen at a critical Ohnesorge number on the order of 0.05 .\nIn order to develop a better understanding for the different regimes that are encountered, particularly the retraction dynamics in these regimes, we propose two simple hydrodynamic models inspired by the standard description of thin film dewetting dynamics.\nThese simple models provide a simple but quite robust picture that allows us to rationalize the retraction rate in both regimes.\nIn order to be able to say something about the speed of retraction, one also needs to\nunderstand the maximum radius to which the droplet expands. Combining our results\nwith those obtained by (Clanet et al. 2004) for the maximum radius, we propose a phase\ndiagram delimiting four regions for the spreading and retraction dynamics of impacting\ndrops.\n\n2. Drop retraction dynamics: Generic Features\nAs the impact dynamics of liquid droplets on a solid surface happens usually in a few\ntens of milliseconds, we use a high-speed video system (1000 frames/second, Photonetics)\nto analyze the drop-impact events. When necessary, we use an ultrahigh-speed system\nallowing to go up to 120,000 frames/second (Phantom V7). We study aqueous drops\nimpacting on a solid surface; the surface we used is Parafilm, which provides us with a\nhydrophobic surface (receding contact angle for water \u03b8R \u2248 80\u25e6 ). In addition, the surface\nhas a low contact angle hysteresis with water, and allows us to obtain highly reproducible\nresults. The liquids we used are different water-glycerol mixtures. Varying the glycerol\nconcentration, we vary the liquid viscosity, keeping the liquid density and its surface\ntension almost constant. For the highest concentration of glycerol, the surface tension\nhas decreased from 72 (pure water) to 59 mN m\u22121 , whereas the density has increased\nto 1150kg/m3. The viscosity is varied between 1 and 205 mPas. Viscosity, density and\nsurface tension were measured before each impact experiment. Drops were produced\nusing precision needles, and the initial radius of the drops R I have been systematically\nmeasured on the images (1.1 < R I < 1.4 mm). From the high-speed images such as the\nones shown in Fig.1, we follow the contact radius R in time. This section summarizes\nthe results of more than 80 different drop impact experiments, each of which have been\nrepeated at least two times.\nTwo series of experiments were performed: first, letting the droplets fall from a fixed\nheight, but increasing the viscosity, we increase the Ohnesorge number while keeping the\ninertial forces constant. The second series of experiments is performed at fixed viscosity\nand upon increasing the height from which the droplets falls; the droplet turns out to be\nin free fall (as is verified in the experiment to within a few\u221apercent) and so the relation\nbetween fall height h and impact velocity is simply V I = gh, with g the gravitational\nacceleration. Increasing the impact velocity increases the Weber number, keeping the\nOhnesorge number fixed, where the Weber number, We, compares the inertial forces to\nthe capillary forces, We \u2261 \u03c1RI V 2I /\u03b3.\nIn all that follows, we restrain ourselves to high-speed impact conditions. More precisely, the Weber and Reynolds numbers are chosen so that We > 10 and Re > 10, where\nRe \u2261 \u03c1RI V I /\u03b7 is the Reynolds number. This implies that inertial forces are at least one\n\n\f4\n\nDenis Bartolo, Christophe Josserand and Daniel Bonn\n012\n\n/\n\n\b\n,-.\n\u0007\n\nP\nO\nN\nM\nL )*+\nJK\nI\nH\n\n!\n\u001e\u001f \u0006\n\u001d\u001c\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0005\n\n&'(\n\u0004\n\n\u0003\n\n#$%\n\n\u0002\n\"\n\n\u0001\n\u000e\n\n\u000f\u0010\n\u0015 \u0016\u0017\u0018\u0019\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0014\n\n3\n\n4\n\n56\n\n78\n\n9:\n\n;<\n\n=>\n\n?@\n\nC DEFG\n\nFigure 2.

Such conditions\nimply large deformations of the drop when the liquid impinges on the solid substrate.\nOn the other hand, we also restrain our experiments to impact speeds that are far from\nthe 'splashing' regime in which the drop disintegrates after impact to form a collection\nof much smaller droplets (Mundo et al. 1995).\nThe pictures in Fig.1 show that two distinctly different regimes exist for the shape of\nthe droplets after impact. For low fluid viscosity, we typically obtain the images shown\nin Fig.1(a). At the onset of retraction, almost all of the fluid is contained in a donutshaped rim, with only a thin film of liquid in the center. On the other hand, for high\nviscosities the deformation of the drop is less important, and the pancake-shaped droplet\nof Fig.1(b) results. These visual observations allow to distinguish the capillary-inertial\nand the capillary-viscous regimes that are described in detail below directly.\n2.1. Drop Retraction Rate: influence of fall height and viscosity\nFig. 2 summarizes the most important findings of this study. The temporal evolution of\nthe drop contact radius R(t) for different impact velocities, shown in (a), is normalized in\n(b) by its maximal value at the end of the spreading R max . Two important observations\nare made. (i) A well defined retraction velocity Vret can be extracted from each experiment; this is a non-trivial observation that will be rationalized below. (ii) Independently\nof the impact speed, all the R(t)/R max curves collapse onto a single curve for different\nimpact velocities. This shows that the retraction rate, rather than the retraction speed is\nthe natural quantity to consider, and that this rate is independent of the impact velocity.\nThese results hold for all the viscosities tested in our experiments.\n\nAB\n\n\fag\n\n5\n\nDrop Retraction upon impact\nWXYZ\n\nTUV\n\n\u01eb\u0307\nRS\n\nQ\n[\\\n\n]^_\n\n`abc\n\nde\n\nFigure 3.

Clearly, the drop retraction rate\ndoes not depend on the impact velocity. One might think that the explanation for this\nobservation is rather obvious: the initial kinetic energy of the droplet is transformed into\nsurface energy (which fixes R max /RI \u221d We 1/2 ), and is then transformed back into kinetic\nenergy (which in turn fixes Vret \u221d VI ). This naive explanation is unfortunately wrong fro\nthe following reasons. First, it has been observed recently that, at the onset of retraction, low viscosity liquids undergo vortical motion in the drop (Clanet et al. 2004). This\nresidual flow in the drop reveals that a part of the initial kinetic energy is still available\nthen, and thus that a simple energy balance argument cannot work. This was indeed\nalready suggested by previous observations of a clear disagreement between experiments\nand the Rmax /RI \u221d We 1/2 law(Fukai et al. 1993; Roisman et al. 2002; Okumura et al.\n2003). The second reason why the simple energy-balance argument does not work follows\ndirectly from Fig. 3, where it is shown that the retraction rate depends on the viscosity\nand consequently that the previous inviscid picture is not correct.\nWe therefore performed experiments that elucidate the role of the viscosity, or, equivalently, of the Ohnesorge number. For what follows, it is convenient to define two intrinsic\ntime scales for the droplet: a viscous one and an inertial one. The viscous time is the\nreplacementsrelaxation time of a large-scale deformation of a viscous drop: \u03c4v \u2261 (\u03b7R I )/\u03b3, whereas the\ninertial time scale: \u03c4i = ( 34 \u03c0\u03c1R 3I /\u03b3)1/2 corresponds to the capillary oscillation period of\na perturbed inviscid droplet. Since \u03c4i is independent of V I and \u03b7, this quantity is almost\nconstant for all tested drops.\nFig. 4 shows the retraction rate, made dimensionless using the inertial time, as a function of the Ohnesorge number. It can be observed in the figure that two different regimes\nexist for the retraction rate. The first region where the retraction rate \u01eb\u0307 is independent of\nthe viscosity points to an inertial regime and \u01eb\u0307 \u221d \u03c4i\u22121 . The retraction rate is consequently\nfound not to depend on the impact speed, a result similar to that obtained recently by\n(Richard et al. 2002) who show that the contact time is independent of the impact speed.\nFor higher viscosities, typically Oh > 0.05, the retraction rate decreases strongly. In this\nregime, capillary and viscous forces govern the dynamics: we find \u01eb\u0307 \u221d \u03c4v\u22121 .\n\n\f6\n\nDenis Bartolo, Christophe Josserand and Daniel Bonn\n\n10\n\n1\n\ne\n\n\u01eb\u0307\u03c4i\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nOh\n\nFigure 4.

Two simple models for the drop retraction dynamics\nWe have consequently established the existence of two different regimes for the retraction rate: a viscous one and an inertial one. We now develop some simple arguments\nallowing for a semi-quantitative description of the dynamics, using ideas already existing\nfor the dynamics of dewetting, a problem closely related to the current one.\n3.1. Inertial regime\n\nrag\n\nWe employ a Taylor-Culick approach commonly used for the inertial dewetting of thin\nfilms (Taylor 1959; Culick 1960; Buguin et al. 1999) to describe the drop retraction rate.\nreplacementsFor high-velocity drop impacts, liquid spreads out into a thin film of thickness h and\nradius R max . The liquid subsequently dewets rapidly the surface, and in doing so forms\na rim that collects the liquid that is initially stored in the film. The shape of the drop\nsurface shape is therefore never in a steady state and consists of a liquid film formed\nduring the spreading stage and a receding rim. The contact angle at the outer side of the\nrim is taken to be very close to the receding contact angle (\u03b8R ) since viscous effects can\nbe neglected small (Buguin et al. 1999). The dynamics is consequently determined by a\ncompetition between capillary tension coming from the thin film and the inertia of the\nrim. If we write down momentum conservation for the liquid rim:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndR(t)\nd\nm\n= FC\n(3.1)\ndt\ndt\nwith m the mass of the liquid rim and FC the capillary force acting on it, FC \u223c\n2\u03c0\u03b3R(t) [1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8R )]. The stationary solution of Eq.3.1 can be obtained writing \u1e41(t) =\n\n\f2\u03c0\u03c1RV ret h, and gives: V ret\n4 3 \u22122\n3 R I R max , it follows that:\n\nDrop Retraction upon impact\n7\np\n= \u03b3[1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8R )]/(\u03c1h). Using volume conservation, h \u223c\np\nV ret\n\u223c \u03c4i\u22121 \u03c0 [1 \u2212 cos \u03b8R )]\nR max\n\n(3.2)\n\nWhich is the final result. Comparing with the experimental data, it turns out that this\nequation not only gives the correct scaling behavior for the retraction in this regime\nrate but also provides a rather accurate estimate of the numerical prefactor (see Fig 4).\nIndeed, the ratio between the experimental and the predicted numerical prefactors is\nfound to be 0.6 Repeating the experiment for water on a polycarbonate surface, which\nchanges the contact angle value to 60\u25e6 , we retrieve exactly the same ratio of 0.6.\n3.2. Viscous regime\nIn the opposite limit of very viscous liquids, the drops adopt pancake shapes upon impact. During the first stages of retraction, the pancake shape rapidly relaxes towards a\nroughly spherical cap, and the drop shape remains like this during the retraction since\nthe capillary number is small. During the retraction, it is only the contact angle that\nvaries slowly: it is mainly this slow contact angle dynamics that dictates the drop evolution during the retraction. Contrary to the previous analysis, the slow receding velocity\nallows to assume a quasi-static dynamics for the surface shape during the retraction.\nIn this regime, it is then natural to assume that the work done by the capillary force\nFC is dissipated through viscous flow near the contact line. Since we focus our study\non high-speed impacts, R max is always much larger that RI which justifies a small \u03b8(t)\napproximation at the onset of retraction. The viscous effects near the contact line then\nlead to the well-known linear force-velocity relation (DeGennes 1985):\n\u0012 \u0013\n6\u03c0\u03b7\n\u039b\n \u0307\nFV = \u2212\nR(t)R(t)\n(3.3)\nln\n\u03b8\n\u03bb\nwhere \u039b and \u03bb are respectively a macroscopic and a microscopic cutoff lengths. \u039b is\ntypically of the same order as the drop size \u223c 1mm. \u03bb is a microscopic length, and is\nusually taken to be on the order of \u03bb \u223c 1nm (DeGennes 1985). On the other hand, the\ncapillary force drives the retraction. Near the contact line it can be written:\nFC = 2\u03c0R(t)\u03b3 [cos \u03b8(t) \u2212 cos \u03b8R ]\n\n(3.4)\n\nVolume conservation gives: 43 \u03c0R 3I \u223c \u03c04 \u03b8(t)R3 (t), where we have taken the small angle\nlimit. Eqs. 3.3 and 3.4 together with the volume constraint leads to the following relation\nfor the variation of the contact radius:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \u2212 21 \u03b82 (t) \u2212 cos(\u03b8R ) \u03b8(t)4/3 \u22121\n\u1e58(t)\n=\u2212\n\u03c4v\n(3.5)\nR(t)\n(144)1/3 ln(\u039b/\u03bb)\nthe above equation is obtained in the small angle limit and is only valid for short time\nafter the onset of retraction. We estimate the retraction rate \u01eb\u0307 as the maximum value of\n\u1e58(t)/R(t) so that:\n\u0012 \u00131/3\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8R )5/3 \u22121\n3\nV ret\n\u2248\n\u03c4v\n(3.6)\nRmax\n25\n5 ln(\u039b/\u03bb)\nComparing again to the experiments, good agreement is found: the retraction rate is\nsolely set by the viscous relaxation time \u03c4v and consequently \u01eb\u0307\u03c4i \u221d Oh \u22121 . Beyond this\ncorrect scaling prediction, Eq. 3.6 provides a quite accurate estimate for the numerical\nprefactor as is shown in Fig 4.

Conclusions and perspectives\nOur experiments reveal that the retraction rate is independent of the impact speed.\nTo account for the retraction speed, the maximum radius to which the droplet expands,\nhas to be known also. A number of studies have been devoted to the understanding of\nthe maximum spreading radius (see for instance (Fukai et al. 1993; Roisman et al. 2002;\nClanet et al. 2004)). However, no clear and unified picture emerges from previous experimental investigations. A recent experimental study of Rmax , combined with recent\ntheoretical ideas in the same spirit of the ones presented here was done by Clanet et al.\n(2004). They obtain a zeroth order (asymptotic) description of the spreading stage, compare it with experiments and suggest that two asymptotic regimes exist for R max . The\nfirst is given by a subtle competition between the inertia of the droplet and the capillary\nforces; if only these two are important, it follows that R max /RI \u221d We 1/4 . In the second\nregime, R max is given by a balance between inertia and viscous dissipation in the expanding droplet, leading to R max /R I \u221d Re 1/5 . Consequently, a single dimensionless number\nis defined that discriminates between the two regimes: P = WeRe \u22124/5 referred to as the\nImpact number. The crossover between the two regimes happens at a P of order unity.\nOur experimental data are in qualitative agreement with their prediction, as is shown in\nFig. 5.a. At low P, the scaling Rmax /R I \u223c We 1/4 is clearly observed. However, for impacts\ncorresponding to P > 1, we observe only a very slow variation of the maximum spreading\nradius as a function of P . Therefore, the relation between R max and the Reynolds number\nis not very clear from our data (Fig 5. c). Although the main trend is not in strong\ncontradiction with the prediction R max /R I \u221d Re 1/5 , a power-law fit of our data gives\nexponents that are always smaller than the predicted value of 0.2. Perhaps even more\nimportant- in view of the small range of the maximal expansion R max that we cover- is\nthat the different water-glycerol mixtures do not appear to collapse on a single master\n\n\fDrop Retraction upon impact\n\n9\n\ncurve, as would be predicted by the above argument. However, since the maximum value\nof P that we reach is on the order of 10, it may be that we have not reached the\npurely viscous regime. In that case, the capillary, inertial and viscous forces are still\nof comparable amplitude and have to be taken into account together. Note also that\nthe more sophisticated models reviewed in Ukiwe & Kwok (2004) do not provide better\nagreement with our experimental measurements.\nDespite this small problem, we are now able to develop a simple unified picture for drop\nimpact dynamics accounting for both the spreading and the retraction dynamics. The two\nnatural dimensionless numbers that have been identified are the impact number P, that\nquantifies the spreading out of the droplet, and the Ohnesorge number Oh that quantifies\nthe retraction. We can thus construct a phase diagram in the experimentally explored\n(Oh, We) plane, which is shown on Fig. 6. The experimentally accessible plane is divided\nin four parts, where the main mechanisms at work during the impact process are different.\nThese four parts are separated by the curves Oh = 0.05 and We = Oh \u22124/3 . They are\nlabeled as follows: ICCI the drop dynamics is given by a competition between inertia and\ncapillarity both for the spreading and the retraction. IVCV: inertia and viscous forces\ndominate the spreading, capillary and viscous forces dominate the retraction. These two\nregimes have been studied in detail here. The two more intriguing regions are the IVCI\n(viscous spreading, inertial retraction) and ICCV (capillary spreading, viscous retraction)\nthat are unfortunately difficult to explore in detail. For the IVCI- regime, the large inertia\nat impact, combined with a small surface tension, will make the droplets undergo large\nnon-axisymetric deformations and they will eventually splash and disintegrate. On the\nother end of the phase diagram, the ICCV region corresponds to very low impact speeds\nand important capillary forces, implying very small deformations of the droplets. If the\ndeformations are small, pinning of the contact line of the droplets will become important,\nand all our simple scaling arguments for both the maximum radius and the retraction\nrate are invalidated.\nA numerical investigation of droplet impact would be very helpful for two reasons.\nFirst, numerics would allow to vary R I while keeping all the other physical parameters\nconstant. This would allow to check the robustness of our results, since experimentally\nit is not easy to vary R I over a wide range. Second, as emphasized above, the viscous\nregime for the maximum radius is difficult to characterize precisely due to the smallness\nof the variation of R max for viscous drops. If precise numerical simulations could be done,\nthese different remaining problems could be resolved.\nIn sum, we have studied the retraction dynamics of liquid droplets upon high-speed\nimpact on non-wetting solid surfaces. Perhaps the strongest conclusion from our investigation is that the rate of retraction of the droplet is a drop constant which does not\ndepend on the impact velocity. Two regimes for the retraction rate have been identified: a viscous regime and an inertial regime. We have in addition shown here that\nsimple hydrodynamic arguments can be formulated that give very reasonable agreement\nwith experiments in the two different regimes.
