Hawking has shown [18]\nthat a black hole radiates away its mass, and he pointed out that if a black hole\nwere to completely evaporate - which it inevitably will in a universe that exists forever in cosmological proper time (a Planck size remnant would probably\nbe inconsistent with the Bekenstein Bound ([13], [14], [11]).) - then any information exclusively inside the black hole would disappear from the universe,\nviolating unitarity. Many solutions have been proposed to resolve this paradox. Hawking himself believes that unitarity is indeed violated, but it has been\nargued that such a resolution would be inconsistent with locality and/or conservation of energy [29]. Susskind ([16], [17]) and 't Hooft [19] propose that all\ninformation inside a black hole is also completely encoded on its surface, so there\nis no net information inside the black hole. But at the semi-classical level, this\n\"holographic principle\" would not resolve the paradox, because the generators\nof an event horizon - the black hole surface - cannot end in spacetime, but at\na singularity which itself would annihilate any information on the horizon. To\navoid unitarity violation, the information must get outside the black hole event\nhorizon.\nBekenstein [15] has pointed out that the Hawking radiation is not quite a\nblackbody spectrum, and thus it carries some information about the initial state\nof the black hole. He has shown that the permitted information outflow rate can\nbe as large as the rate of black hole's entropy decrease, and hence it is possible for\ninformation to gradually leak out of a black hole during evaporation. However,\nBekenstein emphasized that he had not demonstrated that all the information\ngot out, just that it was possible that it did, and if only one bit of information\nfails to escape, unitarity will be violated. Bekenstein also did not address the\nsemi-classical event horizon problem.\nWe shall show in this paper that a purely classical gravity solution to the\nblack hole information problem is possible and consistent with all observations:\nthe universe may have no event horizons at all. In such a universe, there would\nbe no black hole event horizons to prevent the exchange of information between\none part of the cosmos and another. A spacetime with no event horizons has a\nfuture c-boundary ([1], pp. 217\u2013221) which is topologically a single point, and\nhence has been called [12] an Omega Point Spacetime. It can be shown [12] that\nif a spacetime's future c-boundary is a single point, then the spacetime necessarily admits compact Cauchy surfaces, and the global spacetime topology is\nS \u00d7 R1 , where S is the topology of any Cauchy surface. Even in a universe with\ncompact Cauchy surfaces, we would expect black holes to evaporate to completion if the universe were to expand forever. Hence a spacetime which avoids the\nblack hole information paradox because of the absence of event horizons would\nhave to end in a final singularity before any black hole would have time to evaporate. Since the expected black hole lifetime is 1064 (M/M\u2299 )3 years, [11], our\nuniverse would have to expand to a maximum size and recontract before 1064\nyears have passed. It can be shown ([3], [31]) that the only two simple topolo2\n\n\fgies possible for universe with a maximal Cauchy hypersurface and satisfying\nthe weak energy condition are S 3 and S 2 \u00d7 S 1 .\nWe shall construct in this paper a spherically symmetric S 3 universe with a\nblack hole but with no event horizons. The spacetime will be shown to satisfy\nall the standard energy conditions. Indeed, the stress energy tensor for the\nspacetime with be just pressure-free dust in its expanding phase. We shall\ndiscuss various definitions of \"black hole\" in closed universes, and show that\nthe spacetime we construct has a black hole by any of these definitions. The\nparameters of the constructed spacetime can be chosen so that the black hole is\nidentical to a black hole in any dust spherically symmetric (Tolman-Bondi) S 3\nuniverse - and hence it would be in appearance a black hole with event horizons\naccording to any observations that could be carried out in the expanding phase of\na closed universe. The null generators of what is apparently the event horizons\nstay close to the trapped surfaces during the expanding phase of the closed\nuniverse, and only expand out into the universe at large very close to the final\nsingularity. This means the standard astrophysical analysis of black holes and\ntheir collisions (e.g., [32], [33], [34]) can be trusted, since they are in the short\nrun the same as in asymptotically flat spacetime. Thus our proposal is quite\ndifferent from many proposals which eliminate event horizons by eliminating\nblack hole type trapped surfaces. In our proposal, black hole trapped surfaces\nexist as usual, but they do not give rise to event horizons.\nOur paper will be organized as follows. In Section 2 we shall construct a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe which is a standard dust FRW\nclosed universe until arbitrarily near the final singularity when we join it to a\nmetric which satisfies all the energy conditions, which has a final singularity, but\nwhich has no event horizons. In Section 3 we show that the no event horizon\nmetric constructed in Section 2 satisfies the Einstein equations for a scalar field\nwith a suitably chosen exponential potential. In Section 4, we shall generalize the FRW w = \u22121/3 universe to the spherically symmetric case, obtaining\nan inhomogeneous (but spherically symmetric) spacetime which satisfies all the\nstandard energy conditions, yet has a future c-boundary which is a single point.\nIn Section 5, we join this modified version of the FRW event horizonless metric\nto a general Tolman-Bondi closed universe. In Section 6, we discuss various definitions for a black hole in a closed universe, and show that the Tolman-Bondi\nuniverse parameters of the metric in section 5 can be chosen so that by any of\nthese definitions, the expanding phase of the universe has a black hole. In Section 7, we show that the recent supernova observations which strongly suggest\nthat the universe is currently accelerating are consistent with a universe which\nrecollapses to a final singularity before any black hole has time to completely\nevaporate, provided the acceleration is due to quintessence with certain specified properties. Finally in our concluding Section 8, we shall point out how\nour \"no event horizon\" solution to the black hole information paradox naturally complements the \"holographic principle\" resolution, which assumes that\nall information in a black hole interior is coded also on its surface.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nA 3-sphere FRW Universe with Final Singularity But No Event Horizons\n\nThe Friedmann equation for an S 3 closed universe is\n\u0012\n\n1 dR\nR dt\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\n1\n8\u03c0GM\n\u2212\n3R3(1+w) R2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the pressure p = w\u03c1, with w = \u03b3 \u2212 1, where \u03b3 is the adiabatic index and\n\u03c1 the mass density. If w = \u22121/3, then\np\nR(t) = (8\u03c0GM/3) \u2212 1(tf \u2212 t)\n(2.2)\n\nis a solution to (2.1) for t < tf with a final singularity at t = tf , provided\n(8\u03c0GM/3) > 1. The second order equation for the Friedmann universe,\n4\u03c0G\n1 d2 R\n=\u2212\n(\u03c1 + 3p)\nR dt2\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\nis automatically satisfied for p = \u2212(1/3)\u03c1 and d2 R/dt2 = 0.\nThe closed FRW universe with the scale factor (2.2), namely\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + R02 (tf \u2212 t)2 [d\u03c72 + sin2 \u03c7(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )],\n\n(2.4)\n\nhas no event horizons; that is, its future c-boundary consists of a single point\n- the Omega Point. Indeed, the equation for future directed null geodesics,\nds2 = 0 can be integrated for radial null geodesics to give\nZ tf\ndt\n= +\u221e\n(2.5)\n\u2206\u03c7 =\nR(t)\n\nwhich shows that radial null geodesics circumnavigate the universe an infinite\nnumber of times as the future c-boundary at t = tf is approached. By homogeneity and isotropy, we can transpose the coordinate system so that any\nspatial location (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6) can reach any other location (\u03c7\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) via a radial null\ngeodesic segment, and (2.5) shows such radial geodesics can be exchanged an\ninfinite number of times. Hence all future endless timelike curves define the\nsame c-boundary point: the future c-boundary is a single point.\nA perfect fluid with w = \u22121/3 satisfies the weak, the strong, and the dominant energy conditions, since Hawking and Ellis have shown ([1], pp. 89-95)\nthat for diagonalizable stress energy tensors (Type I matter), the weak energy\ncondition will hold if \u03c1 \u2265 0 and \u03c1 + p \u2265 0; the strong energy condition will hold\nif \u03c1 + p \u2265 0 and \u03c1 + 3p \u2265 0; and the dominant energy condition will hold if\n\u03c1 \u2265 0 and \u2212\u03c1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u03c1.\nIt is possible to join the metric with scale factor (2.2) to any closed FRW\nuniverse at any time in the collapsing phase.

One can smooth this metric to one which is C \u221e\neverywhere and which satisfies the energy conditions everywhere by allowing w\nto vary smoothly from 0 to \u22121/3 in a neighborhood [tjoin , tjoin \u2212 \u2206t). By the\nconstraint FRW equation (R\u22121 dR/dt)2 = \u2212R\u22122 + 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3 and the dynamical\nFRW equation 2R\u22121 d2 R/dt2 = \u2212(R\u22121 dR/dt)2 \u2212 R\u22122 \u2212 8\u03c0Gp, continuity in p\nand \u03c1 would insure that R(t) is C 2 , and repeatedly differentiating the dynamical\nequation would yield that R(t) is C \u221e (the constraint and dynamical FRW\nequations imply the conservation equation T \u03bc\u03bd ;\u03bd = 0).\nSince R\u03bc \u03bc = \u22128\u03c0GT \u03bc \u03bc = 16\u03c0G\u03c1 = 16\u03c0GM/R2 for the w = \u22121/3 equation\nof state, where R\u03bc \u03bc is the Ricci scalar, the Omega Point singularity at t = tf\n(at R = 0) is a p.p. curvature singularity ([1], p. 260). The spacetime is a\n5\n\n\fcounter-example to a conjecture by R.K. Sachs [9] that the only Omega Point\nspacetimes are formed by suitably identifying Minkowski space, which would\nhave locally extendible singularities.\n\nA w = \u22121/3 Perfect Fluid Can Be Generated\nBy a Quintessence Scalar Field With an Exponential Potential\n\n3\n\nWe shall now show that a scalar field with exponential potential will generate,\nat least in a FRW universe, a w = \u22121/3 perfect fluid behavior near the final\nsingularity. That is, the w = \u22121/3 perfect fluid behaviour will be seen if the\npotential for the scalar field \u03c6 is of the form V (\u03c6) = V0 eB\u03c6 , where V0 and B\nare constants. Such a potential is often discussed as a particularly plausible\npotential for the inflaton field which is thought to be responsible for inflation in\nthe early universe, and as a model of the quintessence field which is responsible\nfor the cosmological acceleration in the present epoch. This will show that a\nw = \u22121/3 equation of state is physically plausible near the final singularity\nof a closed universe, and thus that the absence of event horizons is physically\npossible.\nThe stress energy tensor for a scalar field \u03c6 with potential V (\u03c6) is [28]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c6;\u03b1 \u03c6;\u03b2 \u2212 g\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c6;\u03bc \u03c6;\u03bd g + 2V (\u03c6))\n(3.1)\n2\nIn the FRW universe, we have \u03c6 = \u03c6(t), so \u03c6;i = 0 and \u03c6;0 = \u03c6,0 , where\nthe i denotes a spatial coordinate, 0 the time coordinate t, and the semicolon\nand comma denote the covariant and partial derivatives respectively.

If the constants V0 and B are fixed by\nthe laws of physics, then as the above relation between these constants and the\nconstants R0 and \u03c60 indicate, the physical laws would also restrict the radius\nof the join, and the value of the scalar field at the join.\nIt is interesting to confirm that the potential (3.9) satisfies the second order\nequation of motion for a scalar field in the FRW universe with R(t) = R0 (tf \u2212t).\nThe equation of motion with arbitrary scalar potential V (\u03c6) is ([12], p. 466;\n[31], p. 431):\n\u03c6;\u03b1 ;\u03b1 =\n\n\u2202V (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn the FRW universe we have \u03c6;\u03b1 ;\u03b1 = (\u03c6,0 ) ;0 = (\u03c6,0 ) ;0 = (\u2212\u03c6,0 ) ;0 , and\n\u221a\n\u221a\nin a coordinate basis, the identity A\u03b1 ;\u03b1 = (1/ \u2212g)( \u2212gA\u03b1 ),\u03b1 , for any vector\nfield A\u03b1 , applies. Thus in a FRW coordinate basis, the scalar field equation of\nmotion can be written\n\u0001\n1\n\u2202V (\u03c6)\nR3 (\u2212\u03c6,0 ) ,0 =\n3\nR\n\u2202\u03c6\n7\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fwhich can be reduced to the standard expression \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0 as\nfollows. In both a coordinate basis, and in an orthonormal basis, we have\nA,0 = dA/dt, for any function A. Thus, for an exponential potential, we have\n\u2202V (\u03c6)/\u2202\u03c6 = BV (\u03c6) = B(\u03c6,0 )2 . Using R = R0 (tf \u2212 t) and the expression (3.6)\nfor \u03c6,0 , it is confirmed that (3.13) is indeed an identity.\nAn alternative derivation of the fact that the w = \u22121/3 equation of state\ncan be generated by a scalar field with exponential potential would be to make\nuse of Barrow's work ([20], [21]) on scalar fields with exponential potentials in\nflat space (FRW k = 0). Barrow in fact noted [20] that in the far future, an\nexponential potential could give rise to the w = \u22121/3 equation of state in the\nk = +1 case, but he did not attempt to derive the constants (B and V0 above)\nthat would allow the w = \u22121/3 equation of state to be joined to a dust equation\nof state for earlier times, which is why we did the calculation above. In addition,\nVilenkin [27] (see also [23]) has pointed out that a w = \u22121/3 equation of state\ncan be generated by a tangled network of very light cosmic strings.\nIn joining two metrics with different equations of state, one effectively assumes that one form of matter disappears and is replaced by the other. More\nrealistically, if a scalar field were to be present near a final singularity, we would\nexpect it to be in addition to dust or radiation already present. In such a situation, a pure exponential potential uncoupled to the other forms of matter would\nnot give rise to a single c-boundary point, if its stress-energy tensor increased\nas R\u22122 , since dust and radiation would increase as R\u22123 and R\u22124 respectively;\nsuch a universe would inevitably become radiation dominated sufficiently near\nthe singularity. However, in a FRW universe, we can always find, for any assumed mixture of dust and radiation, a suitable potential V (\u03c6) which would\nhave the effect of cancelling out the gravitational force of the dust and matter\nfields, leaving an effective pure exponential scalar field (this is in effect what\nhappens after the join between the w = \u22121/3 equation of state and the w = 0\nequation of state fluids).\nBut the actual universe is not expected to be FRW near the final singularity.\nEven if the universe were FRW in the beginning, we would expect it to become\ncurvature dominated near the final singularity, since the \"effective energy density\" curvature perturbations around FRW grow as R\u22126 , much faster than the\ndensities of dust or radiation ([4], p. 807). So in the actual universe, the elimination of event horizons would have to be carried out by the global collective\ninteractions (of known forces) which give rise to the Misner mixmaster horizon\nelimination mechanism, as described in [12].\nOn the other hand, a pure scalar inflaton (quintessence field) with exponential potential might be expected to be the entire matter content in the very\nearly universe, and the initial singularity might be expected to be FRW. In\nsuch a case the effect of such an inflaton field would be to eliminate the particle\nhorizons. In other words, with an exponential inflaton (quintessence) field, the\nhorizon problem of cosmology would be automatically resolved.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nGeneralizing the FRW w = \u22121/3 Omega Point\nSpacetime to the Spherically Symmetric Case\n\nThe approach used in Section 2 for creating spacetimes with no event horizons\ncan be generalized to yield a wider class of such spacetimes. Instead of using\nthe metric (2.4), we introduce functions N (\u03c7) and Z(\u03c7), where N is positive on\n[0, \u03c0] and Z is positive on (0, \u03c0), vanishing at 0 and \u03c0. The metric we then use\nis\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + (tf \u2212 t)2 [N 2 d\u03c72 + Z 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )]\n(4.1)\nProposition 1 A Tolman-Bondi spacetime with metric (4.1) has a c-boundary\nwhich is a single point.\nProof. To check that this spacetime actually has no event horizons, we mimic\nthe calculation of the same proposition for the w = \u22121/3 FRW universe in\nsection 2. Let Nmax be the maximum value of N on [0, \u03c0]. Then\n\u2206\u03c7 =\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\ndt\n\u2265\nN (\u03c7)(tf \u2212 t)\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\ndt\n= +\u221e.\nNmax (tf \u2212 t)\n\n(4.2)\n\nThus in this class of spacetimes, radial null geodesics are capable of hitting\nevery value of \u03c7 an infinite number of times. In order to conclude that every\npoint in space can communicate with every other point, however, we must refine\nthe argument given in Section 2 a bit, for we no longer have the symmetry of the\n3-sphere to exploit. We do, however, still have (2-)spherical symmetry. Therefore we can say that a null geodesic may be sent from the origin to any (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6),\nand vice versa. Hence, given points P1 = (\u03c71 , \u03b81 , \u03c61 ) and P2 = (\u03c72 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 )\nwhich desire to communicate with one another, there exists a piecewise C \u221e\nnull curve from P1 to P2 , consisting of a null curve from P1 to the origin and\nthen a null curve from the origin to P2 . Applying an elementary result of Penrose ([6], Lemma 2.16), we conclude that there exists a timelike or null curve\nfrom P1 to P2 , which is precisely what we wanted. QED.\nWe would like the spacetime (4.1) to satisfy the weak, dominant, and strong\nenergy conditions [1]. Let G be the Einstein tensor of this spacetime. Using\nthe equations for the nonzero components of the Einstein tensor in [2], we can\ncompute G in the orthonormal basis \u03c9 \u0131\u0302 , where:\n\u03c9 0\u0302 = dt,\n\n\u03c9 1\u0302 = N (tf \u2212 t)d\u03c7,\n\n\u03c9 2\u0302 = Z(tf \u2212 t)d\u03b8,\n\n\u03c9 3\u0302 = Z(tf \u2212 t) sin \u03b8d\u03c6.\n\nIn this basis, all off-diagonal terms of G are zero.

Suppose we are\ngiven functions N0 (\u03c7) and Z0 (\u03c7) such that there exist constants R1 , R2 , \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 >\n0 with N0 (\u03c7) = R1 and Z0 (\u03c7) = R1 sin \u03c7 for 0 \u2264 \u03c7 < \u01eb1 and N0 (\u03c7) = R2 and\nZ0 (\u03c7) = R2 sin \u03c7 for \u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb2 < \u03c7 \u2264 \u03c0. In other words, N0 and Z0 look like the\nN and Z from FRW universes near \u03c7 = 0 and \u03c7 = \u03c0. Then we know that\nnear \u03c7 = 0 and \u03c7 = \u03c0, the energy conditions are satisfied for N = RN0 and\nZ = RZ0 , where R is an arbitrary positive constant. Then since the expressions\nmultiplied by N12 in the energy conditions are bounded for \u03c7 \u2208 [\u01eb1 , \u03c0 \u2212 \u01eb2 ], we\nmay find a constant multiplier R such that the metric (4.1) with N = RN0 and\nZ = RZ0 satisfies all the energy conditions everywhere. The current observational evidence indicates that the universe is very close to being spatially flat,\nso the actual universe satisfies the \"sufficiently large\" criterion.\n\n10\n\n\f5\n\nA 3-Sphere Universe Containing a Black Hole\nBut Having No Event Horizons\n\nWe will produce a large class of S 3 \u00d7R1 spacetimes which are in their expanding\nphase, special cases of the general spherically symmetric dust solution [2] and\nwhich are eventually joined to a spacetime of the type described in section 4, so\nthat they end with a c-boundary of a point (and hence have no event horizons),\nand satisfy the energy conditions everywhere.\n\n5.1\n\nGeneral Dust Solution\n\nThe general spherically symmetric pressureless dust solution [2] is:\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + (1 \u2212 f 2 )\u22121\n\n\u0010 \u2202Y \u00112\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nt\n\nd\u03c72 + Y 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the notation ( \u2202Y\n\u2202\u03c7 )t denotes differentiation of Y with respect to \u03c7 where\nthe independent variables are t, \u03c7, \u03b8, and \u03c6 (subscripts to differentials in general\nwill specify independent variables, with the assumption that \u03b8 and \u03c6 are always\nindependent), f is an arbitrary function of \u03c7 alone taking values in [0, 1] and Y\nand t are given by:\nm(\u03c7)\nf (\u03c7)3\nm(\u03c7)\n.\nY = (1 \u2212 cos \u03b7)\nf (\u03c7)2\n\nt = t0 (\u03c7) + (\u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7)\n\n(5.2)\n(5.3)\n\nIn the above expressions, t0 is an arbitrary function of \u03c7 alone, m is another\narbitrary function of \u03c7 positive on (0, \u03c0), and \u03b7 is defined by (5.2). The only\nrestrictions on these free functions are that to maintain the nondegeneracy of\nthe metric in a closed universe, f should equal 1 at one \u03c7-value in the interior of\n[0, \u03c0], at which point m\u2032 , f \u2032 and t\u20320 should all be zero. The general dust metric\nbecomes degenerate whenever Y \u2032 = 0 and f 6= 1 or Y \u2032 6= 0 and f = 1. Such\n2-spheres of degeneracy correspond to shell-crossing singularities, and if these\ndegeneracy spheres occur before the final singularity at \u03b7 = 2\u03c0, they will give\nrise to a breakdown in global hyperbolicity, as is well-known. We shall assume\nthat the free functions m, f, t0 are so chosen that this does not occur.\nThe dust case of the FRW metric (the case where w = 0) is a special case\nof this general metric.

We shall now generalize this construction substantially,\njoining a certain class of Tolman-Bondi pressureless dust solutions (including\nthe FRW S 3 collapsing dust solution) to universes of the sort (4.1), so that we\nproduce a large class of universes which start with pressureless dust and in the\nend have no event horizons.\nIn making this join, we will allow the hypersurface J along which the two\nmetrics are joined to vary as a free function. For convenience, we will take J\nto be spherically symmetric, parametrized as (tJ , \u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6) in the dust universe,\nwhere \u03b7J = \u03b7J (\u03c7) is a free function of \u03c7, and\ntJ \u2261 t(\u03b7J (\u03c7), \u03c7) = t0 (\u03c7) + (\u03b7J \u2212 sin \u03b7J )m(\u03c7)/f 3 (\u03c7)\n\n(5.4)\n\nWe will also assume that the t, \u03c7, \u03b8, and \u03c6 coordinates agree across J .\nTherefore, we will have six degrees of freedom altogether: t0 , m, f , \u03b7J , N , and\nZ, all free functions of \u03c7.\nTo make the join C 1 , we first must make it continuous across J . This in\nparticular means that the metric coefficients will agree along J itself. Therefore\nthe metric coefficients will agree in all derivatives along vectors tangent to J ,\nand thus in order to check that the join is C 1 , one must only check that the\nfirst derivatives of the metric coefficients agree in a direction independent to\nthe tangent spaces of J . The direction we choose is (\u2202/\u2202t)\u03c7 . This direction\nis linearly independent to the tangent spaces of J because (\u2202/\u2202\u03b7)\u03c7 is never\ntangent to J (since J is parametrized with \u03b7 a function of \u03c7), and\n\u0010\u2202\u0011\n\u2202t\n\n\u03c7\n\n=\n\n\u0010\u2202 \u0011\nf3\n.\nm(1 \u2212 cos \u03b7) \u2202\u03b7 \u03c7\n\nSince we are assuming that the coordinates are the same on the dust universe\nas on the universe (4.1), the off-diagonal coefficients already agree (they are 0\non both sides of J ), and gtt is -1 on both sides of J . Furthermore, since we\nhave spherical symmetry on both sides of J , we need check only one of g\u03b8\u03b8 and\ng\u03c6\u03c6 . We are left with four junction conditions:\n\n12\n\n\f(Y \u2032 )2\n= N 2 (tf \u2212 tJ )2\n1 \u2212 f2\nY 2 = Z 2 (tf \u2212 tJ )2\n\u2032\n\n(g\u03c7\u03c7 continuous)\n\n(5.5)\n\n(g\u03b8\u03b8 continuous)\n\n(5.6)\n\n(g\u03c7\u03c7 C 1 )\n\n(5.7)\n\n(g\u03b8\u03b8 C 1 ).\n\n(5.8)\n\n\u2032\n\n2Y \u1e8e\n= \u22122N 2 (tf \u2212 tJ )\n1 \u2212 f2\n2Y \u1e8e = \u22122Z 2 (tf \u2212 tJ )\n\nHere the dot ( \u0307) denotes application of (\u2202/\u2202t)\u03c7 and the prime (\u2032 ) denotes\napplication of (\u2202/\u2202\u03c7)t . These tangent vectors arise from the coordinate system\n(t, \u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6), and thus they commute with one another, so that (5.7) makes sense.\nTherefore we have six free functions - t0 (\u03c7), m(\u03c7), f (\u03c7) on the TolmanBondi side of the join, and \u03b7J (\u03c7), N (\u03c7), Z(\u03c7) on the final singularity side of\nthe join - and four differential equations relating them. One would expect that\nthese four equations would determine four of the functions in terms of the other\ntwo, and this is exactly what happens. We find it convenient to choose m(\u03c7)\nand f (\u03c7) as the arbitrary functions, and expressing all other functions in terms\nof these two. After some manipulation of the above equations we obtain\nm\n(1 + cos \u03b7J )2\n=C 3\n3\nf\n| sin \u03b7J |\n\u0010 2(1 \u2212 cos \u03b7 )\n\u0011m\nJ\nt0 = tf +\n\u2212 \u03b7J\nsin \u03b7J\nf3\n\n|\u1e8e \u2032 (\u03b7J , \u03c7)|\nN= p\n1 \u2212 f2\n\nZ = |\u1e8e (\u03b7J , \u03c7)|.\n\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n(5.11)\n(5.12)\n\nwhere C is a constant of integration. Equation (5.9) can be inverted to give\n\u03b7J (\u03c7). Then \u03b7J is inserted into equations (5.10), (5.11), and (5.12)to yield\nt0 (\u03c7), N (\u03c7), and Z(\u03c7) respectively in terms of the arbitrary functionsm(\u03c7) and\nf (\u03c7), and the constants tf and C . Notice that the allowed Tolman-Bondi\ndust metrics are no longer completely general, since the function t0 is now fixed\nrather than being completely arbitrary. The constants tf and C allow the join\nto be made as far in the future in proper time (the constant tf ) and in \u03b7 time\n(the constant C) as one wishes. To see the latter, note that equation (5.9) is\nof the form F (\u03b7J ) = Cm/f 3 , where F increases monotonically from 0 to +\u221e\nas \u03b7J ranges from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0. Thus if we make C arbitrarily large, \u03b7J can be\nmade arbitrarily close to 2\u03c0, i.e. as close as we wish to the final singularity.\nFurthermore, one observes that the boundary requirement of t\u20320 (that it is 0\nwhenever Y \u2032 and hence m\u2032 and f \u2032 are 0) is automatically satisfied, since by the\njunction conditions\nt\u20320 =\n\n\u0011\nf \u2032 \u0011\u0010 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b7J ) sin \u03b7J\nm \u0010 m\u2032\n.\n\u2212\n\u03b7\n+\nsin\n\u03b7\n\u2212\n3\nJ\nJ\nf3 m\nf\n2 + cos \u03b7J\n13\n\n\fThe join in Section 2 is in fact a special case of this construction. Consider\nthe FRW choices for m and f :\nm(\u03c7) =\n\nRmax\nsin3 \u03c7,\n2\n\nand f (\u03c7) = sin \u03c7.\n\nThen m/f 3 = 1 identically, so that by (5.9) \u03b7J will be a constant, and then by\n(5.10) t0 will be constant. Choosing tf appropriately, we may make t0 identically\nzero, so that our Tolman-Bondi universe is in fact the FRW collapsing dust\nuniverse. As noted above, we may make the join at any time in the collapsing\nphase, just as in the FRW construction of Section 2, and a simple calculation\nreveals that the N and Z forced by the join are precisely those which give the\nw = \u22121/3 universe.\n\n5.3\n\nJoin With a Possible \"Weak\" Shell-Crossing Singularity\n\nIn order to make the metric coefficients differentiable across J , we had to impose\nfour conditions on six functions. We would, however, like to join a completely\narbitrary Tolman-Bondi metric to the metric (4.1), and this will require eliminating one of the equations. The junction condition which on physical grounds\nis the least important is (5.7), the requirement that g\u03c7\u03c7 be C 1 . If g\u03c7\u03c7 is not C 1\nat J , then the curvature will be a \u03b4 function on J , but this \u03b4 function will correspond to a shell-crossing singularity, a singularity that is generally agreed to\nbe unphysical. (Notice also that requiring g\u03c7\u03c7 be C 1 across J actually requires\nthat the radii Y of the constant \u03c7 spheres have one of its second derivatives,\n\u1e8e \u2032 , be continuous across J .) So we drop the junction condition (5.7). A little\nmanipulation yields\nf 3 (tf \u2212 t0 )\n\u03b7J\n=\n2\nm\nm(\u03c7)\n= t0 (\u03c7) + (\u03b7J \u2212 sin \u03b7J ) 3\nf (\u03c7)\n|Y \u2032 (\u03b7J , \u03c7)|\np\nN (\u03c7) =\n(tf \u2212 tJ ) 1 \u2212 f 2\n\u03b7J \u2212 2 tan\n\ntJ\n\nZ(\u03c7) = |\u1e8e (\u03b7J , \u03c7)|\n\n(5.13)\n(5.14)\n(5.15)\n(5.16)\n\nWe proceed as in the previous section, solving first for \u03b7J and then substituting this into the other equations. Note that in order to invert equation\n(5.13), solving for \u03b7J , the fact that t0 must be less than tf (the final t-value of\nthe universe) implies that the LHS should be positive for all values of \u03c7. But\nthen since the positive values of u \u2212 2 tan(u/2) for u \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] are all at least\n2\u03c0, we must therefore have the RHS being at least 2\u03c0 for all values of \u03c7. Since\nm, f , and t0 are all defined on the same compact interval, we may (and must)\nchoose the constant tf so large that the RHS is always at least 2\u03c0. Notice that\n14\n\n\fthe differentiability of N in equation 5.15 will be guaranteed when Y \u2032 = 0 and\nf = 1 because the value of (Y \u2032 )/(1 \u2212 f 2 ) as \u03c7 approaches such a point is well\ndefined and positive, and thus (tf \u2212 t0 ) will be just the square root of this positive value. This means that the more standard type of shell-crossing singularity\n(Y \u2032 = 0 but f 6= 1, so that g\u03c7\u03c7 = 0) is assumed not to occur on J . For this\nreason, we called the allowed singularity a \"weak\" shell-crossing singularity.\nTherefore, if we make the appropriate choice of tf as described above, we may\njoin an arbitrary Tolman-Bondi closed dust metric to the metric (4.1) provided\nwe allow for a possible shell-crossing singularity. The only additional restriction\nwe must impose on the Tolman-Bondi functions m, f , and t0 is that they must\nbe chosen to make the universe \"sufficiently large\" as discussed in Section 4.\n\n6\n\nBlack Holes\n\nOne interesting consequence of the above constructions is that they provide\nexamples of spacetimes satisfying the energy conditions which can contain black\nholes, but do not contain event horizons. In order for this statement to make\nsense, however, we need a good definition of a black hole in a closed universe,\nfor in a closed universe the black hole singularity is actually just a component\nof the final singularity (cf. [5]). We will discuss in detail three such definitions,\nthe first due to Hayward [7], the second due to Tipler [8], and the third due to\nWheeler [5].\nIn the standard definition of a black hole (cf. Wald ([10], p. 300, or [4], p.\n924), the black hole B is the spacetime region B \u2261 M \u2212 J \u2212 (I + ), where M is\nthe spacetime manifold, I + is \"scri plus\" - future null infinity, and J \u2212 (S) is\nthe causal past of a set S, which is to say that J \u2212 (S) is the set of all spacetime\npoints p which can be reached by a past-directed timelike or null curve from\nS to p. (Discussions of global general relativity and the definitions of concepts\nused in this discipline can be found in Wald ([10], chapter 8; Misner, Thorne\nand Wheeler [4], Chapter 34; or ([1]) and ([6]).) This definition cannot be\napplied in a closed universe, because I + does not exist in a closed universe\nwith a final singularity. However, this standard definition of a black hole is\nnever used in practice. When astrophysicists search for black holes, they look\nfor gravitational fields implying the presence of trapped or marginally trapped\nsurfaces. In asymptotically flat spacetimes, (1) all trapped surfaces can be\nproven to be inside of a black hole (in the standard definition), and (2) black\nholes are expected to evolve rapidly to a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole, in\nwhich there are trapped surfaces arbitrarily close to the boundary of the black\nhole \u2202J \u2212 (I + ) - the event horizon. Now trapped surfaces can be in closed\nuniverses.\n\n6.1\n\nTrapped and Marginally Trapped Surfaces\n\nThus, the fundamental concept in Hayward's and Tipler's definitions of a black\nhole is that of a trapped surface (cf. Hayward [7]). Let S be a compact spacelike\n15\n\n\f2-surface embedded in our spacetime manifold. Let P be a point of S. There are\nprecisely two null directions normal to S at P . Suppose furthermore that these\nnull directions can be expressed as two vector fields N+ and N\u2212 defined on all\nof S. We can choose both of N+ and N\u2212 to be future-directed. Now, allowing\nS to evolve along N+ and N\u2212 , we can measure its area at every instant, and\nlogarithmically differentiate the resulting function with respect to the evolution\nparameter. Call these quantities \u03b8+ and \u03b8\u2212 , respectively.\nDefinition 1 S is called a (future) trapped surface if both \u03b8+ < 0 and\n\u03b8\u2212 < 0. If one of these quantities is zero and the other is negative, then S is\ncalled a marginally trapped surface.\nThe intuition here is that light rays emitted from a trapped surface will converge, no matter whether they are sent \"outward\" or \"inward.\" This is certainly\na necessary property of a black hole, and it would be sufficient if it weren't for\nthe fact that the cosmological singularity produces a wealth of trapped surfaces\nas the universe collapses. In a FRW closed universe, for example, there is a\ntrapped surface passing through every spatial point in the collapsing phase. In\norder to distinguish these cosmological trapped surfaces from non-cosmological\nones - black hole type trapped surfaces - we need additional criteria.\n\n6.2\n\nHayward's Black Hole Definition\n\nMarginally trapped surfaces are important because in some sense they are where\nthe horizon of a prospective black hole should be. To distinguish trapped surfaces arising from black holes from those arising from the collapse of the universe,\ntherefore, Hayward considers what should be happening in a neighborhood of a\nmarginally trapped surface which arises because of a black hole. Without loss of\ngenerality let \u03b8+ = 0, \u03b8\u2212 < 0 along the marginally trapped surface S. Then N+\ncan sensibly be called \"outward,\" N\u2212 \"inward.\" Outward-directed light rays\nrun instantaneously parallel to the surface, and inward-directed light rays converge. In the case of black hole-based marginally trapped surfaces, however, we\nwould like to say that outward light rays just outside S diverge, while outward\nlight rays just inside S converge. This can be accomplished mathematically by\nextending the embedding of S to a \"double-null foliation\" (cf. Hayward [7]) in\nthe direction of N+ and N\u2212 , extending \u03b8+ appropriately, and computing the\nsign of L\u2212 \u03b8+ , where L\u2212 denotes the Lie derivative in the direction of N\u2212 .\nDefinition 2 A marginally trapped surface with \u03b8+ = 0 (resp. \u03b8\u2212 = 0) is called\ninner if L\u2212 \u03b8+ (resp. L+ \u03b8\u2212 ) is positive, outer if L\u2212 \u03b8+ (resp. L+ \u03b8\u2212 ) is negative, and degenerate otherwise.\nAs makes sense, inner marginally trapped surfaces correspond to cosmological collapse, and outer marginally trapped surfaces correspond to non-cosmological collapse, i.e., to the marginally trapped surfaces we would expect to find\ninside black holes.\n\n16\n\n\fAs mentioned above, in asymptotically flat spacetimes, all the trapped surfaces are inside the black hole, and furthermore, all future directed causal (timelike or null) curves from any trapped surface Ti can also be shown to be inside\nthe black hole. Thus if B is the black hole region, we must have J + (\u222ai Ti ) \u2282 B\nin order to capture the astrophysically defining feature of a black hole in a\nblack hole definition applicable to a closed universe. Also, in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, any spacetime point p whose causal future eventually enters the\ncausal future of a trapped surface can be proven to be inside a black hole. This\nmeans that we should also include in the black hole B all points p such that\nJ + (J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (\u222aTi )) \u2282 J \u2212 (\u222aTi ).\nThis gives\nDefinition 3 (Hayward) a black hole is the set of all spacetime points p\nsuch that J + (J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (\u222aTi )) \u2282 J \u2212 (\u222aTi ). where \u222aTi is the union of all outer\nmarginally trapped surfaces\n\n6.3\n\nTipler's Black Hole Definition\n\nTipler's criterion ([8]) is related to Hayward's, but perhaps is a bit simpler (see\nHayward [7] for a short discussion of how these criteria relate).\nInstead of using a double-null foliation to test whether a given marginally\ntrapped surface corresponds to the cosmological collapse or to a local black\nhole, Tipler instead supposes that the marginally trapped surface in question is\ncontained in the boundary of a spacelike hypersurface-with-boundary T whose\ninterior T \u2212 \u2202T is foliated by trapped surfaces. He then (assuming without loss\nof generality that \u03b8+ = 0, \u03b8\u2212 < 0) makes the following\nDefinition 4 If the family of null vectors N\u2212 (which are all on \u2202T ) point in\nthe direction of T , then all trapped surfaces which can be obtained from trapped\nsurfaces in T by an acausal homotopy foliated by trapped surfaces will be called\nnon-cosmological.\nIn particular, any trapped surface in T is non-cosmological in this case. Thus\nblack hole type trapped surfaces would be non-cosmological trapped surfaces,\nand we have\nDefinition 5 (Tipler) a black hole is the set of all spacetime points p such\nthat J + (J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (\u222aTi )) \u2282 J \u2212 (\u222aTi ), where \u222aTi is the union of all noncosmological trapped surfaces\n\n6.4\n\nHayward-Tipler Black Holes in Tolman-Bondi Closed\nUniverses\n\nSpecializing to the Tolman Dust case, we already have a convenient foliation by\n2-spheres, and we will use this foliation to assist in evaluating the two definitions\noutlined in the previous section.\n\n17\n\n\fFirst of all, note that the normal bundle to this foliation is spanned by the\nvector fields \u2202/\u2202t and \u2202/\u2202\u03c7. Therefore we may set\np\n\u2202\n1 \u2212 f2 \u2202\nN\u00b1 =\n\u00b1\n,\n\u2202t\nY\u2032\n\u2202\u03c7\nsince \u2202/\u2202t is future-directed and g(\u2202/\u2202t, N\u00b1 ) = 1. Since the area of the 2-sphere\nat (t, \u03c7) is 4\u03c0Y 2 , we can then easily compute\np\n\u0010\n\u03b7\n2f 3\n1 \u2212 f2 \u0011\n2\ncot \u00b1\n.\n\u03b8\u00b1 = N\u00b1 (log(4\u03c0Y )) =\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b7)m\n2\nf\nNote that in order for the 2-sphere at (t, \u03c7) to be marginally trapped, we are\nforced to have \u03b8+ = 0 and \u03b8\u2212 < 0 (since \u03b8+ > \u03b8\u2212 ).\nLet us consider first Tipler's definition. Choose T to be a constant-t hypersurface. An example of a vector pointing in the direction of T is \u03bd =\n\u2212(\u03b8+ )\u2032 (\u2202/\u2202\u03c7) (here primes are as in the join conditions above), since \u03b8+ will\ndecrease to become negative on T , where the 2-spheres will be trapped surfaces.\nThus a sufficient condition for cosmological trapped surfaces in a neighborhood\nof a marginally trapped surface at (t, \u03c7) is\nY\u2032\n.\n0 < g(\u03bd, N\u2212 ) = (\u03b8+ )\u2032 p\n1 \u2212 f2\n\nExpanding this a bit, letting Q = m/f 3 , ignoring positive multipliers and using\nthe fact that \u03b8+ = 0, we obtain the condition\nh t\u2032 + (\u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7)Q\u2032\ni\nY\u2032\nf\u2032\n0\np\np\n> 0.\n\u2212\n4f 4 Q\n1 \u2212 f2\nf2 1 \u2212 f2\n\nWe now consider how Hayward's definition applies. We are taking the derivative in the N\u2212 direction of \u03b8+ , and determining its sign. To that end, we will\nhave a Hayward black-hole-type marginally trapped surface if\np\no\n1 n 1 \u0010f\u2032\n1 \u2212 f2 \u2032\nQ\u2032 \u0011\n\u2032\n0 > L\u2212 \u03b8+ = \u2032\n[t\n+\n(\u03b7\n\u2212\nsin\n\u03b7)Q\n]\n.\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0\nY 2f 3 Q f\nQ\n2f 6 Q2\n\n6.5\n\nBlack Holes in a Joined Universe\n\nNow let us suppose that we are looking for a black hole in a pressureless dust\nuniverse which can be joined to the N -Z universe defined above. We first\nconsider the case of the differentiable join. Leaving m and f free as in our\nderivation of the join conditions, we compute Tipler's criterion to be\nh (T + \u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7)Q\u2032\ni\nf\u2032\nY\u2032\np\np\n> 0,\n\u2212\n4f 4 Q\n1 \u2212 f2\nf2 1 \u2212 f2\n18\n\n\fand Hayward's to be\np\nnf\u2032\n1\nQ\u2032\nQ\u2032 (T + \u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7) 1 \u2212 f 2 o\n< 0,\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2Y \u2032 f 3 Q f\nQ\nQf 3\n\nwhere T (\u03c7) is defined\n\nT =\n\n3 sin \u03b7J\n\u2212 \u03b7J .\n2 + cos \u03b7J\n\nIt is clear that we can choose m, f, tf in the C 1 join in such a way that the\nresulting joined universe contains black holes in either the Hayward or Tipler\nsense, and satisfies the energy conditions.\n\n6.6\n\nWheeler's Black Hole Definition\n\nFollowing Wheeler and Qadir [5], we will consider black holes in the spherically\nsymmetric dust universe to be regions in which the universe is collapsing much\nfaster than elsewhere. An intuitive measure of the rate of collapse of the universe\nin any region is a measurement of the elapsed time between the initial and final\nsingularities.\nWe can use physical models to approximate the elapsed time between singularities in black hole regions. For simplicity, we will consider a one solar\nmass black hole. Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [4] give the time for a particle to fall from radius Ri to the singularity in a standard Schwarzschild black\nhole as \u03c0(Ri3 /8GM )1/2 . Taking Ri to be the Schwarzschild event horizon\nRi = 2GM/c2 , we have that the elapsed time from the penetration of the event\nhorizon to the final singularity is approximately thorizon = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 sec(M/M\u2299 ).\nA dust cloud generating such a black hole would have a total lifetime of twice\nthis, giving us the elapsed time from initial to final singularity as\nttotal = 10\u22125 sec\n\n\u0010 M \u0011\nM\u2299\n\n(6.1)\n\nin the vicinity of a black hole.\nMisner, Thorne and Wheeler [4] cite the illustrative time that might be\nexpected to elapse from the beginning to the end of a typical closed FRW\nuniverse (without black hole regions)as\nttotal = 60 \u00d7 109 years = 1.8 \u00d7 1017 sec.\nCombining this result with the above calculation, we conclude that the elapsed\ntime between initial and final singularities in the vicinity of a 1 M\u2299 black hole\nwill be on the order of 1022 times smaller than that in non-black hole regions of\nthe universe. Since an upper bound to the mass of a black hole in the current\nepoch of universe history is believed to be 1010 M\u2299 , we would expect that the\nelapsed time between the initial and final singularities inside the largest black\nhole in existence today would be on the order of 1012 times smaller than that\nin non-black hole regions of the universe, since by (6.1), a black hole lifetime\nscales linearly with its mass.\n19\n\n\fThe elapsed time from the beginning to the end of the universe along any\ntimelike curves of constant \u03c7 can be obtained from (5.2) by computing t(2\u03c0, \u03c7)\u2212\nt(0, \u03c7). Thus the total time elapsed from initial to final singularity along a timelike curve of constant \u03c7 is simply 2\u03c0m(\u03c7)/f (\u03c7)3 . Therefore we can assert that if\n\u03c7a corresponds to a black hole region of some hypersurface and \u03c7b corresponds\nto the cosmological region, we should obtain that:\nttotal (\u03c7b )\nm(\u03c7b )/f (\u03c7b )3\n> 1013 .\n=\nttotal (\u03c7a )\nm(\u03c7a )/f (\u03c7a )3\n\n(6.2)\n\nTo apply this notion of black holes in the dust universe to our joined metric,\nwe consider any 2-sphere with coordinate radius \u03c7a to be inside a black hole if\n(6.2) is satisfied when \u03c7b is the coordinate radius of a 2-sphere whose size evolves\nlike the 2-spheres of spherical symmetry in a FRW universe. It will be sufficient\nthat there exist a pair of 2-spheres with coordinate radii \u03c7a and \u03c7b such that\n(6.2) is satisfied. Alternatively, we could simply restrict attention to 1M\u2299 black\nholes and fix \u03c7b . An elementary calculation shows that a solar mass black hole is\na 2-sphere with radius corresponding to the radial value \u03c7 = 10\u221223 . A third way\nof picking the pair of 2-spheres is to require that the \u03c7a 2-sphere is the \"largest\"\n2-sphere in the universe \"today\". This would mean that the \u03c7a 2-sphere is an\nextremal - maximal - 2-sphere embedded in the 3-sphere corresponding to\n\"today\". We have to require the 2-sphere to be extremal since one can construct\na non-extremal 2-sphere of arbitrary size embedded in a 3-sphere.\nWheeler points out [5] that the natural meaning of \"today\" - the choice of\na spacelike hypersurface though the Earth - is the constant mean curvature\nhypersurface through the Earth today. Tipler ([12], p. 440) has shown that\nif the strong energy condition holds, and if the universe began close to homogeneity and isotropy, an Omega Point spacetime can be uniquely foliated by\nconstant mean curvature hypersurfaces, so Wheeler's proposal does indeed define a unique \"today\" over the entire universe (Tipler also shows that a constant\nmean curvature hypersurface probably coincides with the rest frame of the CBR\nat any event, so Wheeler's \"today across the entire universe\" is even easy to\nlocate experimentally.) Putting all of these criteria together yields\nDefinition 6 (Wheeler) a black hole is the set of all spacetime points p\nsuch that J + (J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (S)) \u2282 J \u2212 (S), where S is any 2-sphere with coordinate\nradius \u03c7a for which (6.2) holds when \u03c7b is the coordinate radius of a maximal 2sphere in the constant mean curvature hypersurface which includes the 2-sphere\nwith coordinate radius \u03c7a .\nIt is clear that since (6.2) does not depend on the function t0 , just on the\nfunctions m, f , it is possible to construct even in the case of the C 1 join a\nuniverse which is essentially a closed dust FRW everywhere outside a small\nblack hole by Wheeler's definition, a black hole which is centered at the origin\nof coordinates \u03c7 = 0.\n\n20\n\n\f7\n\nQuintessence and Recollapse\n\nThe \"no event horizon solution\" to the black hole information problem requires\nthat the universe recollapse to a final singularity before black holes have time\nto evaporate. However, the best observations [26], independently confirmed by\na number of groups, indicate that the universe is currently accelerating. Furthermore, the observed structure is best explained (given a Hubble constant of\n65 \u00b1 5 km/sec-Mpc and spatial flatness) via a \u039bCDM model [22]. If this acceleration were to continue - as it would if it were due to a positive cosmological\nconstant - then the universe would expand forever, and our proposed solution\nto the BH unitarity problem would be incorrect: unitarity would be violated.\nHowever, Barrow ([20], see also [21]) was the first to point out that an\naccelerating universe today need not preclude a recollapse in the far future of a\nclosed universe. Since the acceleration of the scale factor R is given by equation\n(2.3), namely R\u0308 = \u2212(4\u03c0G/3)R(\u03c1 + 3p) = \u2212(4\u03c0G/3)R(1 + 3w)\u03c1, acceleration\ntoday implies that w < \u22121/3 today (the data give w < \u22125/9 today at the 95%\nconfidence level [23]), but if eventually w > \u22121/3 for all time greater than some\nfar future value tf uture , then the recollapse theorems of Barrow, Galloway and\nTipler [3] will apply, and recollapse will occur.\nThus unitarity implies that the observed acceleration \"today\" (meaning most\nof past proper time) cannot be due to a positive cosmological constant, but\nmust instead be due to quintessence. This is of course the general expectation\nof cosmologists, since the only plausible non-zero values of the cosmological\nconstant are near the Planck density of (1019 GeV)4 , or near the density of the\nSM Higgs field at its minimum \u223c (200 GeV)4 , whereas the observed density\nof the material causing the acceleration is of the order of the closure density,\n(10\u22123 eV)4 ([24], [25]).\nThe \"standard model\" of quintessence ([23], [30]) is a scalar field \u03c6 with\na very shallow potential V (\u03c6) in the p\npresent epoch, resulting in scalar field\nexcitations of very small mass, m\u03c6 \u2261 V \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6)/2 \u2264 H0 \u223c 10\u221233 eV. Since we\nknow very little more than this about V (\u03c6), the potential could have a minimum\naround which the field will oscillate in the far future. In such a case, in the far\nfuture the leading term in the expansion of the potential about the minimum\nwould be 12 m2\u03c6 \u03c62 , yielding [28] an oscillation frequency \u03c9 = m\u03c6 and w \u2192 0 in\nthe far future where m\u03c6 >> H(t). With such a potential for the quintessence,\nrecollapse would occur, since the curvature term in the Friedmann equation\ndecreases as R\u22122 whereas the quintessence term would eventually decrease like\nthe matter, R\u22123 .\nOr the potential could be an exponential with no minimum. These are the\nmost popular current models of quintessence, since such potentials are suggested by supersymmetry. There are many exponential potentials which allow\nrecollapse, as established by Barrow [20]. For example, if the potential dies off\nsufficiently fast with \u03c6, then in the far future, the density will drop off as R\u22126 as\ndoes a massless scalar field, the universe will become matter and then curvature\ndominated in the far future, and recollapse will result.\nIn summary, there are many quintessence models consistent with all current\n21\n\n\fobservations which allow recollapse in the far future. Thus the scenario of horizon elimination proposed in this paper is consistent with all current astronomical\nobservations.\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nThe \"holographic principle\" ([35], [36], [37]) claims that all physics on a manifold -especially quantum gravity - can be completely described by a theory\ndefined only on the boundary of that manifold. This is a completely reasonable\nprinciple in the case that the boundary of the manifold is a Cauchy surface\nfor the manifold, because in this situation the data on the boundary uniquely\ndetermines the manifold and the properties of all physical fields defined on the\nmanifold. For a classical black hole which forms by collapse in an asymptotically flat spacetime and then settles down to a Schwarzschild exterior in the\nfar future, the black hole event horizon is indeed a Cauchy surface for the interior. More generally, if the spacetime is globally hyperbolic, we would expect\nthe event horizon to still be a Cauchy surface for the black hole interior. If\nwe include the c-boundary points in anti deSitter space, then the Cauchy horizons surrounding a region plus the points on the c-boundary where the horizon\ngenerators terminate form a Cauchy surface for the interior spacetime region\nenclosed by the Cauchy horizons; once again we would expect the holographic\nprinciple to be valid.\nBut there are problems with the holographic principle in the case of black\nholes which evaporate to completion. Since the entire spacetime is no longer\nglobally hyperbolic, it is not clear that the event horizon is a Cauchy surface\nfor the interior. There are problems with the c-boundary completion: looked at\nfrom inside a black hole, the c-boundary inside a spherically symmetric black\nhole is a 2-sphere (the TIPs define a 2-sphere), whereas looked at from the future\nafter the evaporation is complete, the c-boundary is a single point (the TIFs\ndefine a point). That is, the causal completion does not define the boundary of\nthe interior manifold uniquely. Even if the event horizon were actually a Cauchy\nsurface for the black hole interior, the information can never leave the horizon\nto the exterior spacetime, since the event horizon generators must terminate at\nthe singularity which ends the black hole evaporation.\nThis problem is obviated in an Omega Point spacetime. The null generators\nof the black hole apparent horizon will actually be a Cauchy horizon for the\nentire spacetime, for it can be shown that \u2202I + (p) is a Cauchy surface for the\nentire spacetime for any point p in the spacetime (Lemma 1 in[12], p. 436).\nThus the holographic principle is true for all manifolds which are future sets\n(sets for which I + (S) \u2282 S). In particular, for all points pi we wish to include\nin \"black holes\" (by any of the defintions given above), the boundary \u2202I + (\u222api )\nwill be a Cauchy surface for the spacetime, and so the holographic principle will\nhold for the surfaces of black holes in Omega Point spacetimes.\nAnother area of general relativity that is naturally complemented by the\nno-event-horizons resolution of the black hole information problem is the com-\n\n22\n\n\fputation of gravitational radiation from colliding black holes. Matzner et al\n[33] have noted that the computer simulation of a black hole collision is much\nsimpler if characteristic evolution is used in the black hole exterior, because in\nasymptotically flat spacetimes, the characteristic formulation can be compactified. In an Omega Point spacetime, the characteristic formulation is automatically compactified: the null boundary \u2202I + (p) of any point p in an Omega Point\nspacetime has been shown by Tipler to be a compact Cauchy surface ([12], p.\n436), as we pointed out above. We conjecture that the calculation would be\neven easier done in an Omega Point background space , such as the spherically\nsymmetric Omega Point spacetimes exhibited in Sections 2 and 4. In an Omega\nPoint spacetime, it is not necessary to add the c-boundary points to compactify\ncharacteristic null surfaces like \u2202I + (p). This is important, because as York has\nrecently emphasized, in general coordinate systems, the initial value problem\ncannot be well-posed in general relativity. However, Tipler has shown ([12], p.\n440) that Omega Point spacetimes which satisfy the strong energy condition\nand begin in a \"crushing\" singularity\" (all FRW singularities are of this type,\nas are all \"stable\" singularities) possess a unique foliation by constant mean\ncurvature hypersurfaces, and York has shown that the initial data problemis\nwell posed on such a hypersurface. (If the universe is currently accelerating, the\nstrong energy condition will not hold everywhere, but nevertheless a constant\nmean curvature foliation will still exist, ([12], p. 439). However, the foliation\nmay only be unique in the very early universe and in the very late universe\nwhere the strong energy condition will hold.) As we have emphasized repeatedly, we define black holes operationally in terms of trapped surfaces, just as\nis done by the groups trying to compute the amount of radiation emitted from\ncolliding black holes. Locally, their calculations of the black hole surfaces would\nbe the same in asymptotically flat space and in an Omega Point spacetime. No\nquantum effects would effect the location or the size or the existence of trapped\nsurfaces evolved in the black hole collision calculations.\nFinally, we point out that many of the well-known difficulties associated\nwith doing quantum field theory in curved spacetimes disappear in Omega Point\nspacetimes. As we mentioned in Section 1, Omega Point spacetimes necessarily are foliated by compact Cauchy surfaces, and in spacetimes with compact\nCauchy surfaces - i.e., in closed universes - there exists a natural unitary\nequivalence class of quantum field theory constructions, specifically, those constructed from all the Hadamard vacuum states ([11], p.96). (Roughly speaking,\na \"Hadamard state\" is one in which the short distance singularity structure of\nthe two point function in curved space is the same as it is in Minkowski space\n[11], pp. 92\u201395). In spacetimes without compact Cauchy surface, there are no\nunitarily equivalent representations of the quantum field algebra, and it was\nthis fact which led many relativists to give up the postulate of unitarity. In an\nOmega Point spacetime, it is not necessary to give up unitarity.\nIt is not even necessary to give up the notion of \"particle\" or \"vacuum state\"\nin a curved Omega Point spacetime, as many relativists have previously believed\n(e.g. [11], p. 59 and p. 96). The method of Hamiltonian diagonalization ([11],\np. 65) will define a unique vacuum and Fock space with respect to any given\n23\n\n\fCauchy surface, and we pointed out above that a unique foliation of the spacetime by constant mean curvature exists in a physically realistic Omega Point\nspacetime (unique except possibly in the periods where the universe is accelerating). These constant mean curvature hypersurfaces are the natural \"rest frame\"\nof the universe, and are the natural corresponding frames to the global Lorentz\nframes in Minkowski space. In FRW universes, the constant mean curvature\nhypersurfaces are the \"rest frames\" of the CBR - observers on worldlines normal to these hypersurfaces would measure isotropic CBR temperature. With\nrespect to such a unique global foliation, the notion of \"particle\" and \"vacuum\nstate\" is defined and is unique in curved spacetime.\nAnd such notions must be defined if quantum field theory in curved spacetime is to be a legitimate low energy limit of the (still unknown) quantum theory\nof gravity. Weinberg ([38], p. 2) has pointed out that quantum field theories are\nregarded today as \"mere effective field theories,\" just low energy approximations to a more fundamental theory. Quantum field theories are not themselves\nfundamental, but we use them only because any relativistic quantum theory will\nclosely approximate a quantum field theory when applied to particles at a low\nenough energy. If this is true, then quantum particles are more fundamental\nthan quantum fields, and thus a semi-classical theory like quantum field theory\nin a classical curved space background must contain a natural definition of the\nmore fundamental entity, the particle.\nIn short, assuming the universe to end in a c-boundary which is a single point\n- assuming the universe to be an Omega Point spacetime - solves the black\nhole information problem, allows the standard concepts of relativistic quantum\nmechanics to be carried over into curved spacetimes, simplifies the characteristic\ninitial value problem, and is consistent with all astronomical observations. The\nactual universe may indeed be an Omega Point spacetime.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. W. Hawking and G. F. R.
