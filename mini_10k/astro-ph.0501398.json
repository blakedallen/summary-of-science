Our model also self-consistently reproduces the\nobserved stellar mass - vcirc relation for local group satellites and produces the correct cumulative mass for the\nMilky Way stellar halo. We predict that the lowest metallicity stars in intermediate-mass dIrr galaxies like the\nSMC and LMC should follow abundance patterns similar to that observed in the stellar halo. Searches for accreted, disrupted, low-mass dwarfs may be enhanced by searching for unbound stars with dSph-like chemical\nabundance patterns.\nSubject headings: galaxies: formation \u2013 galaxies: evolution \u2013 Galaxy: halo \u2013 Galaxy: abundances \u2013 galaxies:\ndwarf\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWhile evidence in support of a \u039bCDM universe continues to mount from high-precision, large-scale cosmological\nobservations (e.g. Spergel et al. 2003; Blakeslee et al. 2003;\nPen et al. 2003; Lahav et al. 2002; Zehavi et al. 2002), a variety of data on galactic and subgalactic scales has remained\nmore difficult to explain (e.g. Simon et al. 2005; Moore et al.\n1999; Klypin et al. 1999; Navarro & Steinmetz 1997, and references therein). Among the biggest questions in cosmology\nis whether \u039bCDM needs to be modified substantially in order\nto account for galactic-scale data (e.g. Spergel & Steinhardt\n2000; Kaplinghat et al. 2000; Col\u00edn et al. 2000) or if physical\nand dynamical processes can explain the data in the context\nof the standard paradigm (e.g. Bullock et al. 2000; Alam et al.\n2002; Robertson et al. 2004). The resolution of this question\nrequires testing our cosmological model against the full realm\nof existing subgalactic data. In this paper, we confront the rich\ndata set of elemental abundances in galactic halo and Local\nGroup dwarf galaxy stars with models set within the \u039bCDM\ncosmology. We conclude that the chemical abundance pattern\nin dwarf irregulars, dwarf spheroidals, and the Milky Way\n1 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden St., Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n2 Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of California, Irvine,\nCA 92697, USA\n3 Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT 06459,\nUSA\n4 brobertson@cfa.harvard.edu\n\nstellar halo can be explained naturally in the context of our\nhierarchical cosmology.\nOne of the fundamental tenets of the CDM paradigm is that\ndark matter halos form hierarchically, via a series of mergers\nwith smaller halos. This prediction gives rise to the natural\nexpectation that the stellar halo is formed from disrupted, accreted dwarf galaxies (Johnston et al. 1996; Helmi & White\n1999; Bullock et al. 2001; Bullock & Johnston 2005;\nFont et al. 2005, in preparation). Indeed, this picture is\nremarkably similar to the ideas of Searle & Zinn (1978) who\nargued for \"chaotic accretion\" based purely on observational\ngrounds. The discovery of fossil evidence of these accretion\nevents via the identification of substructure within the stellar\nhalo of our Galaxy may provide the only direct evidence\nthat structure formation is hierarchical on small-scales\n(Bullock & Johnston 2005). Searches for this substructure\nare under way (e.g. Newberg et al. 2002; Morrison et al.\n2003; Kinman et al. 2004; Brown et al. 2004; Majewski et al.\n2004).\nOne of the main problems facing the hierarchical accretion\npicture for the stellar halo is that abundance patterns of surviving local group galaxies do not match those of stars in\nthe stellar halo (see e.g. Wyse 2004; Venn et al. 2004, \u00a76).\nStars in the stellar halo tend to be old, metal-poor, and \u03b1enriched, with [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c +0.3. The stellar halo abundance pattern contrasts with the younger stellar populations of local,\nmassive dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),\n\n\f2\n\nRobertson et al.\n\nwhich are more metal enriched and have near-solar [\u03b1/Fe] ratios (Jasniewicz & Thevenin 1994; Hill et al. 1995; Hill 1997;\nHill et al. 1997; Venn 1999; Cole et al. 2000; Hill et al. 2000;\nKorn et al. 2002; Smith 2002). Additionally, stars in dwarf\nspheroidal (dSph) galaxies around the Milky Way have intermediate \u03b1-element abundances at low-metallicity, [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c\n+0.15 (Smecker-Hane & McWilliam 1999; Shetrone et al.\n2001; Smecker-Hane & McWilliam 2003; Shetrone et al.\n2003; Venn et al. 2004; Geisler et al. 2005). The discrepancy between the ages and metal abundances of dwarfs\nand the stellar halo is often cited as evidence against the\nhierarchical \u039bCDM prediction (e.g. Unavane et al. 1996;\nGilmore & Wyse 1998; Fulbright 2002; Tolstoy et al. 2003;\nVenn et al. 2004), and has even been used to argue for a revision of the \u039bCDM cosmology (Wyse 2004). The problem\nis clear: how can one build the stellar halo from destroyed\ndwarf galaxies when the stars in low-mass galaxies appear to\nbe chemically distinct from the stars in the halo?\nOur solution to this conundrum relies fundamentally on two\npredictions that follow directly from the \u039bCDM cosmology:\n1) most of the mass in the Milky Way halo was acquired via\nmergers with massive (\u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ) \"dIrr-type\" dark matter\nhalos; and 2) most of these events occurred quite early on, at a\nlook-back time of \u223c 10 Gyr. It follows naturally that the majority of stars in the stellar halo were formed in intermediatemass halos of this type (Bullock & Johnston 2005). The associated galaxies were disrupted soon after accretion and before\nsignificant chemical evolution.\nWithin the context of our scenario, the observed tendency\nfor halo stars to be metal poor and \u03b1-enhanced compared to\nstars in surviving dIrr galaxies follows from standard assumptions about Type Ia vs. Type II supernovae enrichment. Type\nII supernovae provide \u03b1\u2212enhanced enrichment within \u223c 10\nMyr of a star-formation episode (see \u00a74), while the iron-rich\nnucleosynthetic products from Type Ia supernovae contribute\nmuch later, at \u223c 1Gyr. The massive, \"stellar halo progenitor\" halos are accreted early and destroyed soon after. These\nsystems are forced to have short, truncated star formation histories, and naturally host stars that are predominantly Type-II\nenriched and \u03b1-enhanced. In contrast, surviving dIrr galaxies are accreted much later than their destroyed counterparts\n(this is what allows them to survive, see \u00a72), form stars for\nmany billions of years, and have substantial enrichment from\nboth Type Ia and Type II supernovae. Finally, lower-mass,\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies inhabit halos with much shallower\npotential wells (. 109 M\u2299 ) than the massive dIrr galaxies. We\nargue below that blow-out feedback from supernova give rise\nto both the low-metallicities observed in these systems as well\nas their intermediate [\u03b1/Fe] ratios.\nIn what follows, we develop a model to track the chemical enrichment histories in dwarf galaxies forming in cosmologically self-consistent dark matter halos. We use three\nexample mass accretion histories. Two are chosen to be representative of the kind of dark matter halos we expect to host\nsurviving dSph and dIrr satellites, based on \u039bCDM predictions. A third example accretion history is typical of the type\nthat is accreted and destroyed early to contribute to the formation of the halo. We track chemical enrichment by including\ncontributions from Type Ia and Type II supernovae as well as\nstellar winds. Our star formation and feedback model selfconsistently reproduces: 1) the total mass of the stellar halo\n(Bullock & Johnston 2005); 2) the stellar mass-vcirc relation\nexpected for Local Group dwarfs; and 3) the mass - metallicity relation found by Dekel & Woo (2003) (see \u00a75). We go\n\non to use this model to interpret the chemical abundance patterns of the stellar halo, dwarf spheroidals, and dwarf irregular\ngalaxies (Venn et al. 2004).\nWe note that there exists an extensive literature of\ngalactic chemical evolution modelling (van den Bergh\n1962; Larson 1972; Tinsley 1972; Talbot & Arnett 1973;\nPagel & Patchett 1975; Hartwick 1976; Tinsley 1980; Twarog\n1980; Matteucci & Greggio 1986; Matteucci & Tornambe\n1987; Matteucci & Francois 1989; Wheeler et al. 1989;\nFerrini et al. 1992; Timmes et al. 1995; Tsujimoto et al. 1995;\nDevriendt et al. 1999; Ferreras & Silk 2000; Chiappini et al.\n2003; Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2004). We aim neither to\ncritique nor supersede this previous work. Our goal is simply\nto approach galactic chemical evolution with a hierarchically\ndriven and cosmologically consistent method while retaining\ncomplexity in our chemical enrichment code (see also\nBrook et al. 2004a,b). By placing the chemical enrichment of\ndwarf galaxies into the context of their expected cosmological\nformation and subsequent fate, we hope to gain some insight\non interpreting the rich data sets being compiled from Local\nGroup observations.\nIn the next section, we provide an overview of the expected formation histories of Milky Way-type dark matter halos, the accretion and disruption histories of their accreted\nsubhalos, and the mass accretion histories of the satellite halos themselves. In \u00a73 we discuss our star formation law and\npresent our three example mass accretion histories used to facilitate our comparisons to dIrr, dSph, and stellar halo abundance data. We detail our stellar yield modelling in \u00a74, and\nour chemical evolution and feedback calibration in \u00a75. We\npresent our results in \u00a76 and summarize and conclude in \u00a77.\nThroughout this paper we assume a flat \u039bCDM cosmology\nwith \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7, and \u03c38 = 0.9.\n2. COSMOLOGICAL CONTEXT\n\nWe first review several relevant expectations for the formation of galaxy-size dark matter halos within the \u039bCDM\nframework. The reader is referred to Wechsler et al. (2002);\nZentner & Bullock (2003) and Zentner et al. (2005) for more\ndetailed discussions.\n2.1. Hierarchical growth of the Milky Way dark halo\nConsider a galaxy-size dark matter halo of mass Mh at z = 0.\nMass growth in halos of this type proceeds by the merging and\naccretion of a wide mass spectrum of \"subhalos\" or \"satellite halos\". Integrated over the lifetime of the host halo, the\naccreted spectrum of satellite halo masses, Ms , rises softly\n\u22121/2\ntowards the low-mass end, dN/dMs \u221d Ms\nand falls off\nsharply above a characteristic cutoff mass \u223c 0.1Mh . Owing\nto the shallow slope, most of the mass accreted onto the host\nis associated with subhalos of roughly the cutoff mass.\nThe Milky Way's dark matter halo has a virial mass of\nMh \u2243 1012 M\u2299 at z = 0 and is thus expected to have accreted\nmost of its mass via the accretion of intermediate size systems Ms \u2243 (1 \u2212 10) \u00d7 1010M\u2299 (Zentner & Bullock 2003). Accreted subhalos lose mass as a result of violent interactions\nwith the host halo system, and are typically destroyed within\na few dynamical times. The stripped material incorporates\ninto and effectively builds the background dark matter halo of\nthe host. The model of Bullock & Johnston (2005) that serves\nas our cosmological framework accounts for these dynamical\neffects, in addition to the redshift evolution of the characteristic mass and densities of merging systems.\n\n\f\u039bCDM and Galactic Halo Abundances\nThe time line of accretion activity is sensitive to the host\nhalo mass and the governing cosmological parameters. For\nMilky-Way size halos in the standard \u039bCDM model, the accretion rate of dwarf-galaxy halos peaks \u223c 10 Gyr in the past,\nand slows down considerably at a look-back time of \u223c 8 Gyr,\nalthough there is scatter from halo to halo (Zentner & Bullock\n2003). Satellite halos that get accreted during the earliest\nepochs have time to be destroyed by interactions with the\nhost galaxy's environment (see Zentner et al. 2005). The increased efficiency of dynamical friction with satellite mass\ncauses more massive subhalos to lose mass more quickly than\nsmaller subhalos. Most of the subhalos that survive until\nthe present day were accreted during the slow-growth phase,\nwithin the past \u223c 5 Gyr, and therefore represent a temporally\nbiased population compared to their destroyed counterparts.\nWe emphasize that this temporal bias between surviving and\ndestroyed systems implies that the two populations have intrinsically different formation histories: the destroyed population of halos are expected to have formed more rapidly than\nthe subhalos that survive.\nWe expect that the most massive, accreted satellite halos\nwill host dwarf galaxies, and that most of these systems will\nbe destroyed by tidal interactions. Just as the dissipationless\ndark halo of the host is built from the dark matter that was\noriginally associated with accreted and destroyed subhalos,\nthe stellar halo is built from the dissipationless stellar matter that was associated with the same population of destroyed\ngalaxies (Bullock et al. 2001). Given this scenario for stellar halo formation, two important implications follow directly\nfrom the \u039bCDM predictions discussed above:\n1. The majority of the stars contained in the Milky\nWay stellar halo originated in \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 \"dwarf\nirregular-type\" dark matter halos.\n2. The surviving satellite galaxies around the Milky Way\nrepresent a biased population: they typically were accreted later than the dwarf galaxies that were destroyed\nto make the halo.\nThe second point implies that the mass accretion and star formation histories of surviving satellites are more gradual than\ntheir destroyed counterparts.\n2.2. Dark matter halo mass accretion histories\n\nWechsler et al. (2002) used N-body simulations to study the\nmass accretion histories of dark matter halos observed at various redshifts. One of the main results of their work was to\nshow that the cumulative mass accretion in individual dark\nmatter halos can be well-described by a simple function:\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010a\n0\n\u22121 ,\n(1)\nM(a) = M0 exp \u22122ac\na\n\nwhere a = (1 + z)\u22121 is the expansion factor and M0 is the mass\nof the halo as observed at the epoch a0 = (1 + z0 )\u22121 . Given a\nhalo mass and redshift, this function has only one parameter,\nac , which is a characteristic formation epoch for the halo. The\ntypical value of ac varies as a function of halo mass, with more\nmassive halos having earlier formation times. At a fixed M0 ,\nthe distribution of ac is roughly log-normal, with a scatter of\n\u2206 log10 ac = 0.14. Of note is the interesting fact that the ac\ndistribution is independent of a0 for halos of a fixed mass.\nWechsler et al. (2002) showed that the median value of\nthe formation epoch parameter, ac , can be determined for a\n\n3\n\nhalo of mass M0 using a simple model based on spherical collapse. Specifically, ac is set by the epoch at which M\u2217 , the\ntypical collapsing mass (e.g. Lacey & Cole 1993), equals a\nfixed fraction F = 0.015 of the halo mass M0 :\nM\u2217 (ac ) \u2261 FM0 .\n\n(2)\n\nAs expected, this expression for ac is independent of a0 . A\nMilky-Way type halo, for example, has a median ac \u2243 0.30,\ncorresponding to a look-back time of \u223c 10.5 Gyr, which is\nconsistent with the expected epoch of peak accretion discussed above.\n3. STAR FORMATION AND EXAMPLE HISTORIES\n\nWe will use three example mass accretion histories to explore expected differences between halo stars and surviving\nsatellites. Since each system under consideration is a lowmass object with efficient gas cooling, we assume the cold\ngas inflow rate, g(t), tracks the dark matter accretion rate:\ng(t) = fgas h(t \u2212 tin ).\n\n(3)\n\nHere, fgas is the fraction of the dark matter halo mass in the\nform of cold, accreting gas, and h(t) = dM/dt is the halo\ngrowth rate determined by taking the derivative of Equation\n(1) with respect to cosmic time. The time lag t \u2212 tin between\nh(t) and g(t) accounts for the finite time it takes for gas to settle into the central galaxy after being accreted onto the halo.\nWe assume this settling occurs in roughly a dynamical time\nat the virial radius: tin = Rh /vcirc \u2243 2 Gyr (1 + z)\u22123/2 . We set\nfgas = 0.02, in accord with the cold baryonic mass fraction in\nobserved galaxies (Bell et al. 2003).\nThe star formation rate, \u03c8(t), in each system is set using the\nsimple relation\nMgas\n,\n(4)\n\u03c8(t) =\n\u03c4\u22c6\nwhere Mgas is the total cold gas mass in the system and the\nstar formation timescale, \u03c4\u22c6 , is a free parameter. In the models we explore below we assume for simplicity that star formation is truncated soon after each satellite halo is accreted\nonto the Milky Way host as a result of ram-pressure stripping from the background hot gas halo (Moore & Davis 1994;\nMaller & Bullock 2004). Of course, this assumption is oversimplified and cannot be accurate in detail, but it allows us\nto capture the general differences we expect from one example to the next without addressing the complicated interplay\nbetween orbital evolution and star formation. Ram-pressure\nwill be more effective at stripping gas from low-mass objects\nwith shallow potential wells (dSph) while realistically dIrrsize halos will tend to retain their gas more efficiently. Additionally, for a given mass, typical encounter velocities are\nhigher at higher redshifts. Surviving dwarf satellites will undergo correspondingly less ram-pressure stripping than their\ncounterparts that are accreted into the halo early and subsequently disrupted. However, for massive systems that were\naccreted early (a \"halo-progenitor\", for instance) our assumption of star formation truncation will not qualitatively affect\nour results compared to a model where star formation is allowed to continue until the galaxy is tidally destroyed. Earlyaccreted systems are typically destroyed very soon after they\nmerge (over a \u223c 1 Gyr timescale, a typical dynamical time for\na z\u223c1 halo). Nevertheless, we acknowledge our assumption\nof truncated star formation is simplified. We aim to explore\nthe implications of varying models of star formation within\nsatellite halos in subsequent work.\n\n\f4\n\nRobertson et al.\n\nThe gas mass in Equation 4 will not simply be the cumulative integral of gas inflow rate, g(t), as we allow for the effect\nof star formation feedback and associated gas loss within each\nsatellite halo. The system of equations we use to track star\nformation, gas loss, and metal enrichment is presented in \u00a74.\nIncluding this gas outflow, we find that the choice \u03c4\u22c6 = 6.75\nGyr allows us to match the observed mass-to-light ratios in\ndIrr-sized objects, and, when incorporated into our full mass\naccretion history models of the Milky Way, the same choice\ngives a good match to the total Milky Way stellar halo mass\nas well as its radial profile (Bullock & Johnston 2005). The\ninclusion of feedback in our model helps regulate the star formation rate in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we must adopt a\nsmaller star formation timescale than that required in the similar model utilized by Bullock & Johnston (2005) which does\nnot explicitly use a prescription for feedback from star formation. Before moving on to discuss our treatment of outflow\nand metal enrichment in detail, we first introduce our three\nexample mass accretion histories.\nDwarf Irregular Satellite\nFor our surviving, \"dIrr\" satellite halo example, we use a\ndark matter halo of virial mass of M0 = 6 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , which\nwe assume is accreted into the Milky Way halo at a0 = 0.79.\nThis accretion epoch corresponds to a look-back time of 3.1\nGyr, a typical accretion time for surviving, massive satellites (A. Zenter & J. Bullock, private communication) and\nclose to that expected for the LMC from gravitational and hydrodynamical simulations of its orbital evolution within the\nMilky Way potential (Mastropietro et al. 2004). A halo of\nthis mass at a0 = 0.79 has a median maximum circular velocity of vcirc = 72 km s\u22121 (Bullock et al. 2001), but we expect\nthat dark matter mass loss will leave this system with a circular velocity closer to that of the SMC or LMC (\u223c 60km s\u22121 ;\nvan der Marel et al. 2002) after three billion years of evolution (Bullock & Johnston 2005).\nWe assume that the dark matter mass accretion history\nof our dIrr halo follows the form of Equation 1, with a\ncharacteristic formation epoch of ac = 0.231 (Equation 2),\ncorresponding to a look-back time of 11.6 Gyr. Note that\nthe time between \"formation\" at ac and its accretion into\nthe Milky Way dark halo at a0 , this system will have had\n\u223c 8.5 Gyr to form stars \u2013 ample time for both Type Ia and\nType II enrichment. After applying the star formation law\ndiscussed above and the feedback prescription described in\n\u00a74, the final stellar mass and gas mass in this system are\nM\u22c6 = 3.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and Mgas = 4.7 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , respectively.\nAllowing for a small amount of gas loss from ram pressure\nstripping after accretion (see e.g. Mastropietro et al. 2004),\nthese numbers are in line with gas mass and stellar mass\nmeasurements for the SMC and LMC (e.g. Grebel 2001;\nGrebel et al. 2003).\nDwarf Spheroidal Satellite\nOur Dwarf Spheroidal example consists of a relatively lowmass halo, M0 = 5.6 \u00d7 108M\u2299 , accreted at a0 = 0.667 or at a\nlook-back time of 5 Gyr. The accretion time is typical for that\nof surviving satellite halos of this size (A. Zentner & J. Bullock, private communication). The halo's formation epoch is\nac = 0.08, corresponding to a look-back time of 13.1 Gyr. This\nsystem has a maximum circular velocity of vcirc = 20km s\u22121\nat accretion, which will likely be reduced to vcirc \u2243 15km s\u22121\nafter five billion years of evolution within the galaxy potential (Bullock & Johnston 2005). This circular velocity agrees\n\nwith circular velocity estimates for dSph satellite galaxies in\nthe Local Group (e.g. Zentner & Bullock 2003). The time\navailable for star formation between ac and a0 is \u223c 8 Gyr for\nthis system.\nIt is now well-known that if \u039bCDM is correct, only roughly\none-in-ten of the dwarf-size satellite halos can host a dwarf\ngalaxy, with the rest remaining dark (Moore et al. 1999;\nKlypin et al. 1999). A natural solution to this problem relies\non the fact that halos of this size (vcirc . 30kms\u22121 ) are unable to accrete gas after the universe becomes reionized (e.g.\nBullock et al. 2000). We account for this effect by setting the\ngas accretion rate g(t) = 0.0 after the epoch of reionization,\nare . The value of ac we have adopted for our dSph example\nis \u223c 2\u03c3 earlier than the median expected for a halo of its size\n(via Equation 2). We have made this choice in order to ensure\nthat this halo collapses before cosmic reionization and is able\nto host a visible dwarf galaxy. Our assumption about the effect of reionization on dwarf galaxy formation allows our picture to self-consistently address the \"dwarf satellite problem\"\nwithout modifying the tenets of \u039bCDM. For concreteness, we\nchoose are = 0.09, but our results are insensitive to this choice.\nThe stellar mass and gas mass within this system at\naccretion is M\u22c6 = 1.1 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 and Mgas = 3.8 \u00d7 105 M\u2299\nrespectively. The stellar mass is consistent with that of\ndSph galaxies in the local group, and its gas mass fraction\nis lower than that in the dIrr example, also in accordance\nwith observed trends (e.g. Mateo 1998; Grebel et al. 2003,\nand references therein). We expect that the gas mass in this\nsystem will be further reduced after accretion as a result of\nefficient ram pressure stripping from the shallow host halo\npotential well.\nStellar Halo Progenitor\nAs argued in \u00a72.1, and discussed in more detail in\nBullock & Johnston (2005), the hierarchical scenario predicts\nthat most of the mass in the stellar halo was contributed by\nseveral massive subhalos that were accreted onto the Milky\nWay host long ago. We choose to model one such subhalo as our example \"stellar halo progenitor\" a dark halo\nwith a virial mass equal to that of our dIrr example above,\nM0 = 6 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 , but which was accreted 9 Gyr in the past,\nat a0 = 0.417. Because this subhalo has the same mass as\nthe dIrr example, the stellar halo progenitor has the same formation epoch, ac = 0.231. However, because the subhalo was\naccreted (and destroyed) at a much earlier time, the time available for star formation in this system is only \u223c 2.6 Gyr, and\nwe therefore expect that the \u223c 1 Gyr required for Type Ia enrichment will limit significant Type Ia enrichment in this system.\nWhen we apply our star formation and feedback model, the\nstellar mass at accretion in this system is M\u22c6 = 2.4 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\nand the cold gas mass is Mgas = 7.2 \u00d7 108M\u2299 . The high gas\nfraction is a result of have a shorter time available to turn gas\ninto stars. Indeed, since a majority of the baryons in the Milky\nWay system were accreted in early events of this size (\u00a72.1),\ngas-rich mergers of this type are likely fundamental in fueling the growing Milky Way bulge and disk components. Although a large number of lower-mass subhalo accretion events\nwill likely contribute significant substructure to the Galactic\nhalo, we expect that \u223c 4 \u2212 5 mergers of subhalos similar to our\nhalo progenitor model are responsible for most of the mass of\nthe Milky Way stellar halo.\nIn Figure 1, we plot star formation histories as a function\n\n\f\u039bCDM and Galactic Halo Abundances\n\n5\n\nas we consider stars of mass 0.1 \u2264 m \u2264 100. Our normal\u22121\nization provides \u03c6(m) in units of M\u2299\nand allows us to calculate our yields per unit solar mass of stars. We note that for\nstellar masses m > 0.5M\u2299 the Kroupa IMF is very similar to\nthe Salpeter (1955) IMF that has a constant slope of s = 2.35,\nthough, as discussed by Kroupa (2002), uncertainties in determining the IMF of massive stars may mask a steeper slope\nof s \u2248 2.7 for stars above 1 M\u2299 .\n4.2. Type II Supernovae\nGiven an IMF, we can track the cumulative number of Type\nII supernovae that have occurred per solar mass of star formation as a function of time t as\nM\nZII,max\n\u03c6(m)dm.\n(8)\nNII (< t) =\nM\u22c6 (t)>MII,min\n\nF IG . 1.- Model star formation histories of our halo-progenitor example\n(solid line), dIrr (dotted line), and low-mass dSph galaxy (dashed line). The\nhalo-progenitor model forms stars quickly until it is accreted into the stellar\nhalo \u223c 9 Gyr ago. The surviving dIrr galaxy forms stars more gradually, until\nits recent accretion into the galaxy \u223c 3 Gyr ago. The dwarf spheroidal galaxy\nhas its gas infall suppressed by reionization early-on and converts its gas mass\ninto stars until its accretion into the galaxy \u223c 5 Gyr ago. Both the dIrr and\ndSph are expected to survive as Milky Way satellites until the present day.\n\nof look-back time for each example history: halo-progenitor\n(solid line), dwarf irregular (dotted line), and dwarf spheroidal\n(dashed line). The break in the dSph track at \u223c 13 Gyr is associated with suppression of gas infall at reionization. From\nFigure 1 we see that the halo-progenitor star formation history is truncated and more rapid compared with the surviving\ndIrr. The history of the dSph example is intermediate between\nthe two. We now address how these differences will manifest\nthemselves as chemical signatures in the different stellar systems.\n4. STELLAR YIELDS\n\nIn order to track the time-dependent chemical content of\ndwarf galaxies during their formation, we model the chemical\nyields from stellar populations, including Type Ia supernovae,\nType II supernovae, and stellar winds from intermediate mass\nstars. The rate of enrichment is calculated analytically and\nthe yields for individual chemicals are selected from the literature.\n4.1. Initial Mass Function\n\nWe define our initial mass function (IMF) as\ndN\n= B(m/M\u2299 )\u2212s ,\n(5)\ndm\nwhich provides the differential number of stars of mass m.\nWe adopt the Kroupa (2001, 2002) IMF, which has a massdependent slope s given by\n(\n0.3 : 0.01 \u2264 m < 0.08\n(6)\ns = 1.3 : 0.08 \u2264 m < 0.5\n2.3 : m \u2265 0.5\n\nHere, M\u22c6 (t) is the mass of a star with stellar lifetime t and\nMII,min is the minimum mass star producing a Type II supernova and MII,max is the maximum stellar mass that will\nproduce Type II yields. We assume that all stars more massive than MII,max = 50M\u2299 will collapse completely into black\nholes and we use MII,min = 10M\u2299 .\nFor the stellar lifetime as a function of star mass, we adopt a\ndual power-law fit to the Schaller et al. (1992) stellar lifetimes\nof the form\n\u0013\u22123\n\u0013\u22120.55\n\u0012\n\u0012\nM\nM\n+ 0.035\n(9)\nt\u22c6 (M) = 10.5\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\nwith t\u22c6 in Gyr. The the inverse quantity M\u22c6 (t) and its derivative dM\u22c6 /dt\u22c6 can be obtained from this relation. The rate of\nType II supernovae per solar mass in each stellar population\nis\ndM\nRII (t) = \u2212\n\u03c6[M\u22c6 (t)],\n(10)\ndt\u22c6\nwith no further normalization being necessary as all massive\nstars between MII,min and MII,max are considered to produce\nsupernovae.\nThe instantaneous chemical yield of an element X from\nType II supernovae as a function of time after a stellar population forms will then follow\nYX,II (t) = yX,II [M(t)] RII (t),\n(11)\nwhere yX,II [M] is the Type II yield of element X from a star\nof mass M. In practice, we use the Type II yields from\nTsujimoto et al. (1995) and Thielemann et al. (1996), interpolating between their simulated models in order to obtain yields\nas a continuous function of mass.\nGiven the above model, Type II supernovae provide enrichment from t\u22c6 (50) = 4.1 Myr until t\u22c6 (10) = 20.4 Myr after each\nstellar population forms.\n\n\u03c6(m) \u2261\n\nWe set the constant B to normalize the IMF to give\nZ 100\nm\u03c6(m)dm = 1M\u2299 ,\n0.1\n\n(7)\n\n4.3. Type Ia Supernovae\n\nIn calculating the rate of Type Ia supernova, we follow the\nformalism developed by Greggio & Renzini (1983), which\npostulates that the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae are binary star systems. The rate of Type Ia supernovae is set by the\nevolution of the secondary star in each binary system.\nWe define the number of Type Ia supernovae that have occurred before time t as\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nM\nZb,max\nZ1/2\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u03c6(Mb ) \uf8f0 21+\u03b3 (1 + \u03b3)\u03bc\u03b3 d\u03bc\uf8fb dMb , (12)\nNI (< t) = A\nMb,inf\n\n\u03bcinf\n\n\f6\n\nRobertson et al.\n\nwhere A is a normalization parameter. The outer integral sums\nover the total binary mass, Mb = M1 + M2 ,with M2 < M1 ,\nand the term in brackets describes the distribution of secondary mass fractions \u03bc = M2 /Mb . The exponent \u03b3 = 2\nsets the spectrum of secondary masses. The upper limit on\nthe total binary mass is set by twice the maximum primary\nmass that allows the development of a degenerate C/O core\nbefore filling its Roche lobe, Mb,max = 16M\u2299 . The lower\nlimit forces M2 \u2264 M1 via Mb,inf = MAX[M2 (t), Mb,min ] with\nMb,min = 3M\u2299 following Greggio & Renzini (1983). As in\n\u00a73.2, M2 (t) is the mass corresponding to the stellar lifetime t. The lower limit on the secondary mass fraction is\n\u03bcinf = MAX[M2 (t)/Mb , (Mb \u2212 21 Mb,max )/Mb ]. In order to approximate local supernovae rates as determined by Tammann\n(1982), we follow the Matteucci & Greggio (1986) Type I SN\nnormalization. Adjusting the Matteucci & Greggio (1986) result for our chosen IMF, we find A \u2248 0.0956.\nGiven the cumulative number of Type Ia supernovae as a\nfunction of time t, the corresponding rate is simply\ndNI (< t)\n.\n(13)\nRI (t) =\ndt\nThe instantaneous chemical yield for each element X from\nType Ia supernovae is then YX,I (t) = yX,I RI (t). For the individual\nyield per supernovae yX ,I , we adopt the yields of the Nomoto\nW7 Type Ia supernova model (Nomoto et al. 1984, 1997). In\nthis model the Type Ia supernovae provide enrichment for t >\nt\u22c6 (8) = 31.7 Myr after each stellar population forms, with the\npeak of the Type I rate occurring at t \u223c 1 Gyr.\n4.4. Stellar Winds\nWe follow the chemical enrichment from stellar winds by\ntracking the death rate of stars and assuming the majority of\nthe stellar mass loss occurs during asymptotic giant branch\nthermal pulsing near the end of the stellar lifetime. Our effective rate of stellar winds is then\ndM\n\u03c6(M),\n(14)\nRW (t) = \u2212\ndt\u22c6\nwhich, like the Type II supernovae rate, is set by the IMF\nand stellar lifetimes. The instantaneous chemical yield of\nan element X from stellar winds is then YX,W (t) = yX,W RW (t).\nWe utilize the van den Hoek & Groenewegen (1997) timedependent stellar wind yields yX ,W , interpolating over mass\nand metallicity for stellar masses between 0.8 \u2212 8 M\u2299 . Stellar winds provide enrichment in this model continuously after\nt\u22c6 (8) = 31.7 Myr.\n5. CHEMICAL ENRICHMENT AND FEEDBACK\n5.1. Tracking Abundances\n\nWe aim to track the abundances of H, He, Fe, and the \u03b1elements O and Mg using the three example accretion histories discussed in \u00a72. To do so, we follow the evolution of\nstellar mass M\u22c6 , gas mass Mgas , and mass MX in each element\nX using the system of equations:\ndM\u22c6\n= \u03c8(t) \u2212 Y(t)\n(15)\ndt\ndMgas\n= \u2212\u03c8(t) + Y(t) + g(t) \u2212 e(t)\n(16)\ndt\ndMX\n= \u2212 fX \u03c8(t) + YX (t) + hX g(t) \u2212 fX eX (t).\n(17)\ndt\nAs discussed in \u00a72.3, the star formation rate is assumed to\ntrack the mass in cold gas as \u03c8(t) = Mgas /\u03c4\u22c6 , and the gas infall\n\nrate, g(t), tracks the halo mass accretion rate. The quantity\nY (t) is the total rate of mass input into the gas from supernovae of both types and stellar winds, summed over all stellar\npopulations. Similarly, YX (t) is the instantaneous input rate\nof the specific element X, again summed over supernovae and\nwinds for all stellar populations. The gas mass fraction in each\nelement X is fX = MX /Mgas , and hX is the elemental mass fraction in newly accreted gas. The ejection rate for each element\nis chosen to follow the star formation rate as eX (t) = wX \u03c8(t),\nwith wX representing the efficiency of gas blow-out for element X. The total gas ejection rate in the second equation is\nthen the sum over all elements X, e(t) = \u03a3 fX eX (t).\nEach star formation history begins by accreting low- metallicity, alpha-enriched gas, with [Fe/H]= \u22124.0 and [\u03b1/Fe]=0.3.\nThroughout the history of each galaxy, we assume that the\ninfalling gas retains this initial Type II-enriched abundance\npattern (this sets hX in Equation 17), although, in detail, our\nmodel results are insensitive to the abundance pattern of the\nlow-metallicity infalling gas. In the results presented in \u00a76,\nwe define our abundances relative to the solar abundances\nmeasured by Grevesse & Sauval (1998). We turn now to a\nmore in-depth discussion of our treatment of blow-out feedback. Our feedback prescription is important for explaining\nthe abundance pattern in low-mass, dSph-type galaxies.\n5.2. Feedback and the Mass-Metallicity\n\nand Mass-vcirc Relations\nGas and metal ejection from supernovae winds almost\ncertainly plays an important role in shaping the properties\nof galaxies \u2013 especially dwarf-sized galaxies (Dekel & Silk\n1986). Dekel & Woo (2003) (DW) have used a compilation of\ndwarf galaxy data to show that the stellar masses and metallic2/5\nities of dwarf galaxies follow a fairly tight relation, Z \u221d M\u22c6 ,\nand have argued that blow-out feedback can naturally explain\nthis trend. Although similar relations were noted previously\n(e.g., Brodie & Huchra 1991; Zaritsky et al. 1994), we refer\nto this trend as the \"Dekel-Woo relation\", and use it to motivate and normalize our prescription for galactic supernovae\nejecta. The feedback prescription we present below in fact reproduces the Dekel-Woo relation, but also gives rise to and explains the [\u03b1/Fe] abundance pattern trends observed for lowmass dwarf galaxies. We note that our prescription for gas and\nmetal ejection does not strongly affect our conclusions regarding the stellar halo progenitor abundance pattern nor those of\nour surviving dIrr example. The robustness of the model predictions for these subhalos results because the dark halos of\nthese systems are relatively massive. However, ejection plays\nan important role in the star formation and enrichment history\nof our lower-mass dSph example, where the typical energy of\nsupernovae ejecta is significant compared to the binding energy of the halo.\nWe can estimate the efficiency of gas and metallicity ejection from dwarf halos, w, by taking the ratio of specific energy\nof gas that escapes the central dwarf galaxy as a wind, Ew , to\nthe specific binding energy of the halo:\nw\u2248\n\nEw\n1 2\n2 vcirc\n\n\u2248\n\n\u01eb\u03b7ESN NSN\n,\n1 2\n2 vcirc\n\n(18)\n\nwhere vcirc is the circular velocity of the halo in question. The\nenergy of the gas that leaves the central galaxy will depend\non NSN , the number of supernovae per unit mass in the stellar\npopulation and ESN , the energy per supernovae. The factor\n\u03b7 is the fraction of supernovae energy converted into kinetic\n\n\f\u039bCDM and Galactic Halo Abundances\nenergy, and \u01eb is the fraction of the input kinetic energy that\nis retained by the gas that actually escapes the galaxy as a\nwind. The kinetic energy fraction \u03b7 will depend on the speed\nat which supernovae bubbles overlap compared to the radiative timescale of the gas in the galaxy, and therefore on the\nsupernovae rate (Dekel & Silk 1986). It typically will not exceed a few percent, and is commonly taken to be 5% in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (c.f. Abadi et al.\n2003). With this, typical numbers give w \u2248 22\u01eb\u03b75 v\u22122\n50 , where\n\u03b75 \u2261 \u03b7/0.05 and v50 \u2261 vcirc /50 km s\u22121 , and we have used\n\u22121\nNSN \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299\n, which follows from our chosen IMF\nand stellar population modelling.\nThe fraction of kinetic energy \u01eb retained by gas that escapes\nas a wind will vary between elements. While H and He will\nprimarily not be entrained in the wind because of interactions\nwith the surrounding ambient medium, \u01eb \u226a 1, metals will be\npreferentially blown-out of galaxies in the metal-rich supernovae ejecta, \u01eb \u223c 1 (Mac Low & Ferrara 1999). Furthermore,\nthe rate of Type Ia supernovae per stellar population is quite\nslow, dragging out over Gyr timescales, while the Type II supernovae rate is rapid. We therefore expect that the bubble\noverlap time and kinetic energy fraction to be slightly lower\nfor Type Ia compared to Type II ejecta: \u03b7\u03b1 . \u03b7Fe . Motivated\nby this physical picture, we set the gas blow-out efficiency of\ngas, Fe, and \u03b1-elements in halos of varying circular velocities\nto be\n\u0011\u22122\n\u0010 v\ncirc\n,\n(19)\nwgas (vcirc ) = 0.15 \u00d7\n50km s\u22121\n\u0010 v\n\u0011\u22122\ncirc\nw\u03b1 (vcirc ) = 14.4 \u00d7\n,\n(20)\n50km s\u22121\n\u0011\u22122\n\u0010 v\ncirc\n.\n(21)\nwFe (vcirc ) = 16.8 \u00d7\n50km s\u22121\nWe have adopted the standard kinetic energy fraction \u03b7 = 0.05\nfor gas and Fe, but a slightly lower value,\u03b7 = 0.035, for the \u03b1\nelements. We have used \u01eb = 0.01 for the gas and \u01eb = 0.8 for\nthe metals.\nWhile our choices for wFe and wgas are of roughly the expected size, we have chosen their precise values in order to\nreproduce the observed M\u22c6 \u2212 vcirc relation for dwarf galaxies in the local group (DW; see Bullock & Johnston 2005) as\nwell as to approximate the Dekel-Woo mass-metallicity relation. Figure 2 shows the stellar-mass metallicity relation\nestimated by DW as the solid line, with the dashed lines indicating the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 scatter in metallicities about the relation.\nThe two solid circles and the open circle show our model results for the dSph, dIrr, and stellar halo progenitor examples,\nrespectively. The error bars reflect the 68% spread in metallicity range for stars in each model galaxy. In order to more fully\ncompare with the observed relation, we have also included results for a range of surviving satellite halos from the models\nof Bullock & Johnston (2005). The mass accretion histories\nof these satellites were generated in the same way discussed\n\u00a72, except now we span a more complete range in vcirc . The\nmodel galaxies generally reproduce the observed trend, with\ngood agreement considering the uncertainty in the data and\nthe difficulty in assigning precise stellar masses to these observed systems. We retain the stellar feedback calibration that\nprovides this agreement for the proceeding calculations.\nNote that there is very little freedom in our parameter\nchoices. Recall that t\u22c6 and fgas in our mass accretion model\nare already fixed to reproduce the stellar mass of the Galactic\nhalo and the cold baryon fraction in galaxies. Once these are\ngiven, w is constrained by the stellar mass-vcirc relation, and\n\n7\n\nF IG . 2.- The stellar mass - metallicity relation for local dwarf galaxies.\nWe plot the observed trend from Dekel & Woo (2003) (solid line), the region\ncontaining 70% of the observed data (dashed lines), and the calculated relation for a range in mass of model dwarf galaxies (crosses). The error bars\non the model calculations delineate the \u223c 1 \u2212 \u03c3 metallicity range (68%) of\nstars in each system. We use this calibration to constrain the strength of stellar feedback in our model. We also plot our models for surviving dSph and\ndIrr galaxies (filled circles) and the halo-progenitor model (open circle) for\ncomparison.\n\nwFe by the approximate stellar mass-metallicity relation. Finally, the parameter w\u03b1 is chosen to reproduce observations\nof the chemical abundance pattern of dSph type galaxies once\nthe above list of complimentary observational data is invoked\nto constrain our other free parameters. In the next section\nwe show that our choices for the wind efficiencies indeed reproduce observations of the chemical abundance pattern of\ndSph-type galaxies. We argue below that the chemical content of low-mass dwarf galaxies should then show trends as\na function of stellar mass and circular velocity. Specifically,\nwe expect that high-mass systems will tend to have near solar\nabundance patterns, while low-mass dwarfs will have intermediate [\u03b1/Fe] ratios.\n6. RESULTS\n\nThe three panels in Figure 3 show the [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\ntracks computed for our stellar halo progenitor (top), dSph\nexample (middle), and dIrr example (bottom). The tracks correspond to the star formation histories presented in Figure 1.\nIn all cases, solid lines show [O/Fe] and dotted lines show\n[Mg/Fe]. The final stellar masses (at accretion) for the systems are indicated in the bottom left of each panel. The thick\nregion along each line corresponds to the abundance region\ninhabited by the middle 68% of stars in each system (the 68%\nspread by mass about the median).\nIn the upper panel, our massive (M0 \u2243 5 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 ), earlyforming, stellar halo progenitor forms stars quickly until it is\naccreted into the Galactic halo \u223c 9 Gyr ago. Its gas enriches\nto [Fe/H]= \u22120.7 and an \u03b1-abundance of [\u03b1/Fe]=0.1 just before accretion, while its stars typically have a metallicity of\n[Fe/H]\u2243 \u22120.9 and [\u03b1/Fe] \u2243 0.2. Upon accretion, we expect\nthis system to quickly disrupt, and contribute its stars to the\nstellar halo (\u00a72). Over the predicted chemical evolution tracks\nwe plot abundance data (crosses) for galactic halo stars from\nTable 2 of Venn et al. (2004), from which we select all stars\n\n\f8\n\nRobertson et al.\n\nF IG . 3.- The [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance of our halo-progenitor (top panel), dwarf spheroidal (middle panel), and dIrr-type galaxy (lower panel). Top: The\nhalo-progenitor model retains a super-solar [\u03b1/Fe] abundance pattern, resembling the stellar halo data (crosses, from Venn et al. 2004). Middle: The abundance\npattern of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy is set by the strength of the stellar feedback, which forces its [\u03b1/Fe] abundance below that of halo stars. For comparison,\nwe overplot abundance data of similarly-sized dSph galaxies from Venn et al. (2004) as crosses. Bottom: The majority of the star formation in the massive dIrr\noccurs at near-solar values of [\u03b1/Fe] and at higher metallicities, similar to stellar abundances in the SMC (stars and crosses from Venn 1999; Hill et al. 1995,\nrespectively). Note that we expect extremely metal poor stars in the SMC and LMC to have enhanced, halo-like [\u03b1/Fe] ratios.\n\nwith Galactic halo membership probabilities greater than 50%\n5\n. The halo-progenitor dwarf galaxy abundance pattern is consistent with the overall abundance pattern of the Galactic halo.\nAgreement between our model and the data arises because\nthe stellar halo progenitor is accreted and destroyed before\nsignificant Type I enrichment can occur. More generally, we\nexpect that the super-solar \u03b1-abundance of halo stars is inherited naturally from the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of these massive, early-accreted dwarf galaxies (Font et al. 2005, in preparation). As discussed in \u00a72, the\n\u223c 1.5 \u00d7 109M\u2299 stellar mass of the halo (Carney et al. 1990)\n5 The data was originally obtained by Fulbright (2000, 2002);\nGratton & Sneden (1988, 1991, 1994); Hanson et al. (1998); Ivans et al.\n(2003); McWilliam et al. (1995); McWilliam (1998); Ryan et al. (1996);\nStephens & Boesgaard (2002).\n\nis expected to be dominated by stars from disrupted systems\nof this type (Bullock & Johnston 2005).\nIn the middle panel of Figure 3, our low-mass (M0 \u2243\n5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ), dSph example forms stars more gradually, and\nis accreted onto the Milky Way halo \u223c 5 Gyr ago. Metal enrichment is suppressed in this system compared to the other\ntwo panels because the dSph halo is more loosely bound and\nsupernovae winds can more easily escape (\u00a74.2). Since the\noverall ejection rate is higher, the relative efficiency of blowout for Type I and Type II supernovae ejecta is more apparent and creates the break in the trajectory in the dSph track.\nFor comparison, the crosses show \u03b1-abundance data compiled by Venn et al. (2004) for Local Group dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. The data reflects the well-established disparity between the [\u03b1/Fe]\u223c0.3 abundance ratios of Galactic stellar\nhalo stars and the [\u03b1/Fe]\u223c0.0 - 0.2 abundance ratios of lo-\n\n\f\u039bCDM and Galactic Halo Abundances\ncal, low-mass dwarf galaxies at similar metallicities. It is encouraging that our model dSph evolves on an \u03b1-abundance\ntrack that overlaps with data of observed dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies, with its final stellar abundance peaking at [\u03b1/Fe]\u2243\n0.05 and [Fe/H]\u2243 \u20131.65. We emphasize again that this agreement stems from supernovae blow-out. The differences between the \u03b1-abundance pattern for our halo progenitor and\nour dSph example primarily results from the relative potential well depths of their host dark matter halos. However, we\nnote that differences between the \u03b1-abundance pattern of specific dSph galaxies may reflect different efficiencies for blowout of Type Ia and Type II supernovae ejecta between systems (c.f. Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2004) than what we adopt\nabove. In principle, differences in blow-out efficiencies between systems will depend on the complicated hydrodynamical problem of following the overlap of supernovae bubbles\nand cannot be properly addressed by our simple modelling.\nSimilarly, our choice of initial mass function affects the number of supernovae per unit mass of stars formed, but such alterations to our modeling can be accomodated through our\nfeedback calibration and similar results can be obtained for\ne.g. the Salpeter (1955) IMF. We therefore rely on the observed trends of \u03b1-abundance in dSph galaxies, the DekelWoo relation, the total stellar mass of the Galactic halo, and\nthe stellar mass-vcirc relation expected for Local Group dwarfs\nto constrain our singular choices for the blow-out efficiencies\nthat we utilize in our modelling.\nFinally, the [\u03b1/Fe] vs [Fe/H] track for our massive (M0 \u2243\n5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ) dIrr example evolves in a similar manner to that\nof our stellar halo progenitor case, except that it is accreted\nmuch later and can continue evolving for several more billion\nyears. Because of this longer, slower star formation history,\nthe effect of Type I supernovae is more pronounced than in the\nhalo-progenitor case. The gas metallicity enriches to [Fe/H]\n= \u22120.6 with an \u03b1-abundance of roughly solar, while the inner 68% of stars by mass span a metallicity of [Fe/H] = \u22120.95\nto [Fe/H] = \u22120.6 and range from [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.2 to near solar\nvalues. Indeed, it has abundance patterns typical of massive\nsatellite galaxies in the local group, as illustrated by the overplotted from LMC stars by Hill et al. (1995) and SMC stars\nby Venn (1999). Note that we predict that the lowest metallicity stars in galaxies like the SMC and LMC should have\nabundance patterns similar to those in halo stars. The similarity of \u03b1-abundance patterns in dwarf galaxies at early times\nsuggests we cannot rule out a scenario in which the Milky\nWay stellar halo was completely comprised from the destruction of dSph galaxies before they were significantly enriched\nby Type I supernovae. However, the statistics of dark matter\nhalo accretion histories (see Zentner et al. 2005) suggest such\na scenario is unlikely in the context of hierarchical formation\nof the stellar halo. Furthermore, dynamical modelling of the\nformation of the stellar halo might rule out such a scenario\nthrough differences in the resultant spectrum of phase-space\ncorrelations.\nOverall, the differences in the shape of the abundance pattern tracks between the halo, dSph, and dIrr models are\nstraightforwardly attributable to the mass-dependent strength\nof the feedback implementation. The stronger winds in the\nlow-mass dSph model cause the [\u03b1/Fe] abundance to drop\nnear [Fe/H] = \u22122 as \u223c70% of the metals produced by star formation have been expelled from the system by this time. At\nthe same metallicity, the halo progenitor and dIrr models have\nonly lost \u223c7% and \u223c9% of their metals, respectively. For the\ndSph model, Type I SN begin to dominate over Type II SN by\n\n9\n\nthis metallicity and the retention of Fe relative to \u03b1-elements\ncorrespondingly increases. The relative strength of the \u03b1- and\nFe-wind efficiencies will vary between individual dSph galaxies (see, e.g., Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2004) to produce their\nvarious abundance patterns, but the [\u03b1/Fe] tracks of the more\nmassive halo progenitor and dIrr systems will be fairly insensitive to these details as their less efficient winds begin to\nstrongly change their abundance patterns at characteristically\nhigher metallicities.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nBy combining cosmologically-motivated star formation and\ngas accretion histories for dwarf galaxies with modelling of\nthe chemical yields from stellar populations, we demonstrate\nthat the abundance patterns of the Galactic halo, low-mass\ndwarf spheroidals, and more massive dwarf irregular galaxies can be understood within the context of cosmologicallymotivated models of the stellar halo and dwarf galaxy formation. A straightforward prediction of \u039bCDM is that most of\nthe stars in the stellar halo were formed in dIrr-sized dark matter halos that were accreted at early times and subsequently\ndestroyed. The destroyed, proto-halo systems are short-lived,\nform their stars rapidly, and are enriched predominately by\nType II supernovae. They are disrupted before the iron input\nfrom Type I supernovae can drive them to higher metallicities,\nleaving a chemical abundance pattern that matches observations of low-metallicity, \u03b1\u2212enriched halo stars.\nLonger-lived, dIrr-type galaxies that survive to the present\nday, form their stars more gradually. These systems undergo\nboth Type I and Type II supernovae enrichment. We presented\na \"typical\" dIrr-type accretion history, which enriched to a\nmoderate metallicity with an abundance pattern similar to that\nof the SMC and LMC. We predict that lower-metallicity stars\nin the SMC or LMC will likely show similar abundance patterns to those of halo stars.\nLow-mass dSph-type galaxies are likely systems whose\nchemical abundance patterns have been altered significantly\nby supernovae winds, as their shallow potential wells cannot\nretain outflows. Adopting simple assumptions about the ejection wind efficiency, we showed that the expected population\nof surviving dwarf satellite galaxies in \u039bCDM galactic halos\nmatch the stellar-mass/metallicity relation observed for localgroup dwarfs (Dekel & Woo 2003). We then argued that the\nsame stellar feedback is essential in explaining the \u03b1\u2212element\nabundance patterns in dSph galaxies, and demonstrated this\nidea by presenting an explicit, cosmologically-motived dSph\nmodel that follows the abundance pattern of the observed\ndwarf spheroidals successfully. Our expectation is that the\nabundance data for dwarf spheroidal galaxies as a function of\ntheir stellar mass can be matched by similar, cosmologicallymotivated star formation histories (Font et al., in preparation).\nWe predict that [\u03b1/Fe] ratios should gradually approach the\nsolar value in dwarf galaxies of increasing stellar mass (or velocity dispersion).\nAs discussed, most of the stars in the Galactic stellar\nhalo are likely remnants of early-forming dIrr-type galaxies\nthat chemically bear little resemblance to present-day dwarf\nspheroidals. At the same time we expect that a significant\nnumber of dSph-size galaxies have been accreted and destroyed over the Milky Way's history. Because of their shallow potential well depths, these low-mass dwarf remnants\nshould be chemically distinct from most of the background\npopulation of the stellar halo. Fossil evidence of these accretion events may be more easily detected if chemical signatures\n\n\f10\n\nRobertson et al.\n\nare used to help identify substructure (e.g. Nissen & Schuster\n1997; Font et al. 2005, in preparation). We also note that further constraints on our modeling are supplied by observations\nof the age and metallicity distribution of halo stars. While\nthe modeling presented here demonstrates that the chemical\nabundance pattern of typical halo progenitors match the observed [\u03b1/Fe] ratio in the Galactic halo, our model must be\nextended account for the full ensemble of halo progenitors\nexpected from the time-dependent mass spectrum of accreted\nsubstructure predicted by the \u039bCDM scenario for structure\nformation. Such an improvement to our modeling will be presented in future work (Font et al. 2005, in preparation).\nWhile we adopt a feedback formulation commonly used to\nmodel chemical evolution in galaxies, we note other feedback models may be more physically motivated. For instance, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation may\ninclude multiphase descriptions of the interstellar medium\n(McKee & Ostriker 1977) that may more naturally produce\nself-consistent star formation histories for dwarf galaxies\nas the microphysics of the ISM are better captured (e.g.\nSpringel & Hernquist 2003). Hydrodynamic simulations can\nalso include the effects of supernovae-driven galactic winds\nformulated in a manner similar to what we employ, but the\ndetailed calculations of the expansion and cooling of shocks\nallow a reduction in the net number of free parameters (for instance the need for \u01eb is eliminated, see Springel & Hernquist\n2003). As these forms of feedback affect the star formation\nhistory and gas content of a given object, they will also affect galactic chemical evolution. We also note it is possible\nthat some dwarf galaxies with spheroidal components contain intermediate-mass supermassive black holes (Barth et al.\n2004; Greene & Ho 2004), and hydrodynamical simulations\nof mergers of galaxies containing supermassive black holes\nwith thermal feedback driven by Bondi (1952)-style accretion\n(Springel et al. 2004; Di Matteo et al. 2005) demonstrate that\nsupermassive black holes may have considerable impact on\nthe star formation history and gas content of their host systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes may then significantly alter the chemical evolution history of galaxies in\na manner not considered here. Due to the complex hydrody-\n\nnamical and radiative cooling issues posed by supernovae and\nblack hole feedback, we suggest self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations that include the relevant physics described\nabove may be necessary to model more completely the effects of feedback on the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies and the Galactic stellar halo. However, to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of a cosmologically-motivated explanation for\nthe abundance of the stellar halo we believe our comparatively simple model is sufficient. We note that our chemical\nenrichment modeling could be incorporated into the calculations of Bullock & Johnston (2005) to form a more complete\nframework to model the detailed properties of the Milky Way\nstellar halo. We plan to present this model in a future paper\n(Font et al. 2005, in preparation).\nWe close by mentioning that our model does not capture\nthe full complexity of the available observations, notably of\nheavy elements like Ba, Y, and Eu (Venn et al. 2004), and future inconsistencies between the scenario for the formation of\nthe halo presented here and observations may arise. Future\nmodelling could conceivably help draw stronger connections\nbetween the very detailed stellar observation and cosmological scenarios for the origin of dwarf galaxies and the stellar\nhalo. For instance, as full chemical modeling becomes incorporated into cosmological simulations of galaxy formation,\nquestions about the chemical abundance of thick disk stars\nand accreted dwarf systems (c.f. Wyse 2004) will find more\nsatisfying answers (see e.g., Brook et al. 2004b). We therefore encourage future attempts to coordinate detailed chemical modelling with cosmological calculations to increase the\ninterface between cosmology and galactic astronomy.\n\nThe authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with K.
