It is common\nopinion that noise affecting the dynamics of a system introduces some degree of instability to\nthe system itself, but there is evidence that in some cases the noise can increase the stability\nof a system [1, 2, 3, 4]. Noise modeling through the use of the stochastic processes formalism\nhas applications that involve many systems including physics, biology, ecology [5, 6, 7] and\neven financial markets [8, 9, 10]. The most basic model for financial market is the geometric\nBrownian motion [12]. This model has different drawbacks, it cannot reproduce in fact three\nimportant stylized facts observed in financial time series: (i) the non Gaussian distribution\nof returns, (ii) the fat tails [9, 10], and (iii) the stochastic character of volatility, which is\ncharacterized by long range memory and clustering [9, 10, 11, 13]. More complex models\nhave been developed to reproduce the dynamics of the volatility. It is worthwhile citing\nthe ARCH [14] and GARCH [15] models, where the actual volatility depends on the past\nvalues of squared return (ARCH) and also on the past values of the volatility (GARCH).\nAnother class of models use a system of stochastic equations writing the price as a geometric\nBrownian motion coupled with a non-constant volatility described by a second stochastic\ndifferential equation. The Heston model uses for the volatility a multiplicative stochastic\nprocess characterized by mean reversion [16, 17]. Both the models presented so far have\nexponential autocorrelation function so they are not able to reproduce quantitatively the\nlong range memory observed in real markets. Nonetheless using values of the characteristic\ntime that are sufficiently high, they are able to give accurate statistic for the stock prices,\nby tuning only few parameters. Another important characteristic of financial markets is the\npresence of different regimes. Markets indeed present days of normal activity and extreme\ndays where very high or very low price variations can be observed. These are known as\ncrash and rally days. A nonlinear Langevin market model has already been proposed [18],\nwhere different regimes are modelled by means of an effective potential for price returns. In\nsome circumstances this potential has a cubic shape with a metastable state and a potential\nbarrier. The dynamics inside the metastable state represents the days of normal evolution\nwhile the escape after the potential barrier represents the beginning of a crisis. Metastable\nstates are ubiquitous in physics and the effect of noise in such systems has been extensively\nstudied [1, 2, 3, 4], but considering the noise intensity as a parameter (physical models\n2\n\n\fdescribed by additive stochastic differential equations for example). Financial markets with\ntheir stochastic volatility are an example of systems where the noise intensity is far from\nbeing a constant parameter, but it is indeed a stochastic process itself. Moreover there is\nevidence in nature that the noise intensity is not a constant parameter and can be modelled\nas a multiplicative noise [6, 7, 19]. So it is interesting to release the hypothesis of parametric\nnoise intensity in financial market models as well as in natural systems.\n\nII.\n\nTHE HESTON MODEL WITH A METASTABLE STATE\n\nThe Heston model introduced in the previous section is described by the following system\nof coupled stochastic differential equations [16]\n\np\n\nv(t) * dZ(t)\np\ndv(t) = a(b \u2212 v(t)) * dt + c v(t) * dW (t)\n\ndx(t) = (\u03bc \u2212 v(t)/2) * dt +\n\n(1)\n\nThe price p(t) follows a geometric random walk whose standard deviation is another\nstochastic process. Here x(t) = ln p(t) is the log of the price, Z(t) and W (t) are uncorrelated Wiener processes with the usual statistical properties: (i) hdZ(t)i = 0 and\nhdZ(t) * dZ(t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )dt; (ii) hdW (t)i = 0 and hdW (t) * dW (t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )dt. The\nv(t) process is characterized by mean reversion, i.e. its deterministic solution has an exponential transient with characteristic time equal to a\u22121 , after which the process tends to\nits asymptotic value b. The process for v(t) exhibits the phenomenon of volatility clustering, alternating calm with burst periods of volatility, and has an exponential autocorrelation\nfunction. The smaller the value of a the longer are the bursts in volatility. Heston model has\nbeen subject of recent investigation by econophysicists [20, 21, 22, 23]. The equations of the\nsystem (1) are well known in finance, they represent respectively the log-normal geometric\nBrownian motion stock process used by Black and Scholes for option pricing [24, 25], and\nthe Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) mean-reverting stochastic differential equation first introduced\nfor interest rate models [26, 27].\nHere we consider a generalization of the Heston model, by replacing the geometric Brownian motion with a random walk in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity. This generalization\nrepresents a \"Brownian particle\" moving in an effective potential with a metastable state,\n3\n\n\fin order to model those systems with two different dynamical regimes like financial markets\nin normal activity and extreme days [18]. The equations of the new model are\n\u0012\n\n\u2202U\nv(t)\n+\n\u2202x\n2\n\n\u0013\n\np\n* dt + v(t) * dZ(t)\np\ndv(t) = a(b \u2212 v(t)) * dt + c v(t) * dW (t),\n\ndx(t) = \u2212\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U is the effective cubic potential U(x) = px3 + qx2 , with p = 2 and q = 3 (see Fig. 1),\nZ(t) and W (t) are standard Wiener processes. Let us call xM the abscissa of the potential\n2\n\nU(x)\n\nxM\n1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nxI\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nx\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: Cubic potential used in the dynamical equation for the price x(t). The points in the figure\nindicate the starting positions used in our simulations.\n\nmaximum and xI the abscissa where the potential intersects the x axes. The intervals\nxo < xI and I = [xI , xM ] are clearly regions of instability for the system. In systems with a\nmetastable state like this, the noise can originate interesting effects that increase instead of\ndecrease the stability, by enhancing the lifetime of the metastable state [1, 2, 3, 4]. A good\nexample is the Noise Enhanced Stability (NES) phenomenon. The mean escape time \u03c4 for\na Brownian particle moving throughout a barrier \u2206U, with a noise intensity v, is given by\nthe well known exponential Kramers law [28, 29]\n\u0015\n\u2206U\n,\n(3)\n\u03c4 = Aexp\nv\nwhere \u03c4 is a monotonically decreasing function of the noise intensity v, and A is a prefactor\n\u0014\n\nwhich depends on the potential profile. This is true only if the random walk starts from\n4\n\n\finitial positions inside the potential well. When the starting position is chosen in the instability region xo < xM , \u03c4 exhibits an enhancement behavior, with respect to the deterministic\nescape time, as a function of v. Particularly for initial positions x0 < xI , we have nonmonotonic behavior of \u03c4 as a function of v [2, 30]. This is the NES effect and can be explained\nconsidering the barrier \"seen\" by the Brownian particle starting at the initial position x0 ,\nthat is \u2206Uin = U(xmax ) \u2212 U(x0 ). Moreover \u2206Uin is less than \u2206U as long as the starting\nposition x0 lyes into the interval I = [xI , xM ]. Therefore for a Brownian particle, from a\nprobabilistic point of view, it is easier to enter into the well than to escape from, when the\nparticle is entered. So a small amount of noise can increase the lifetime of the metastable\nstate [1, 2, 4, 30]. For a detailed discussion on this point and different dynamical regimes\nsee Refs. [2, 30]. When v is much greater than \u2206U, the Kramers behavior is recovered. The\nNES effect has been experimentally observed in a tunnel diode and theoretically predicted\nin a wide variety of systems such as for example chaotic map, Josephson junctions, chemical\nreaction kinetics, and neuronal dynamics models [1, 2, 3, 4]. Our modified Heston model,\ncharacterized by a stochastic volatility and a nonlinear Langevin equation for the returns,\nhas two limit regimes, corresponding to the cases a = 0, with only the noise term in the\nequation for the volatility v(t), and c = 0 with only the reverting term in the same equation.\nThis last case corresponds to the usual parametric constant volatility case. In fact, apart\nfrom an exponential transient, the volatility reaches the asymptotic value b. The NES effect\nshould be observable in the latter case as a function of b, which is the average volatility. In\nthis case, in fact, we have the motion of a Brownian particle in a fixed cubic potential with\na metastable state and an enhancement of its lifetime for particular initial conditions (see\nRefs. [2, 30]).\n\nIII.\n\nENHANCEMENT OF THE ESCAPE TIME\n\nThe two processes of Eqs. (1) and (2) are actually uncorrelated. In financial markets the\ntwo processes can be correlated, and a negative correlation between the processes is known\nas leverage effect [31]. Heston model with correlation has been recently discussed in the\nscientific literature [21, 23]. Our modified Heston model becomes therefore\n\n5\n\n\f\u0012\n\nv(t)\n\u2202U\n+\ndx(t) = \u2212\n\u2202x\n2\n\n\u0013\n\np\n* dt + v(t) * dZ(t)\np\ndv(t) = a(b \u2212 v(t)) * dt + c v(t) * dWc (t)\np\ndWc (t) = \u03c1 * dZ(t) + 1 \u2212 \u03c12 * dW (t),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Z(t) and W (t) are uncorrelated Wiener processes as in Eqs. (1) and (2), and \u03c1 is\nthe cross correlation coefficient between the noise sources. The investigation is performed\nsimulating the process of Eqs. (4) with time integration step \u2206t = 0.01, and for the fixed\nstarting position x0 = \u22121.25 in the I interval (this initial position is shown as a black square\npoint in Fig. 1). The absorbing barrier is located at x = \u22126.0, and the results are averaged\nover 105 escape events. The algorithm used to simulate the noise sources in Eqs. (4) is based\non the Box-Muller method for generating random processes with a Gaussian distribution.\nThe numerical integration of Eqs. (4) is done by using the forward Euler method [32].\nOur first result shows that the curve \u03c4 vs. b is weakly dependent on the value of the \u03c1\nparameter. This is shown in Fig. 2, where all the curves correspond to the region of the\nparameters space where the effect is observable. There is indeed a weak variation in the\nmaximum value. The highest maximum values correspond to the highest absolute \u03c1 values.\nIt is worth noting that the correlation affects directly the noise term in the v(t) equation,\nand it has negligible influence on the reverting term of the same equation.\nThe curves of \u03c4 vs. c however have an evident dependence on the parameter c. This is\nshown in Fig. 3, for two values of parameter a for which the NES effect is observable. The\ncorrelation affects the position as well as the value of the maximum of \u03c4 (see Fig. 3), but in\na different way. The position of the maximum increases only for very high positive values of\nthe correlation coefficient. The maximum value of \u03c4 increases with positive correlation but\ndecreases with negative correlation. This effect is more evident for the higher value of a, as\nshown in Fig. 3b. To comment this result we first note that a negative correlation between\nthe logarithm of the price and the volatility means that a decrease in x(t) induces an increase\nin the volatility v(t), and this causes the Brownian particle to escape easily from the well. As\na consequence the mean lifetime of the metastable state decreases, even if the nonmonotonic\nbehavior is still observable. On the contrary, when the correlation \u03c1 is positive, the Brownian\nparticle stays more inside the well, decrease in x(t) indeed is associated with decrease in the\nvolatility. The escape process becomes slow and this increases further the lifetime of the\n6\n\n\fFIG. 2: Mean escape time \u03c4 as a function of the mean volatility b. The other parameters have\nthe fixed values a = 10\u22122 and c = 10\u22122 .

Specifically in Fig. 2a we report the values of \u03c4max related to\nthe curves of \u03c4 of Fig. 2, and in Fig. 2b those related to Fig. 3. The increase of stability is\n\nFIG. 4: The values of \u03c4max as a function of the correlation coefficient of the curves reported in\nFigs. 2 and 3. Specifically: (a) \u03c4max from Fig. 2 (\u03c4 as a function of parameter b) with a = 10\u22122 ,\nc = 10\u22122 ); (b) \u03c4max from Fig. 3 with a = 2.0 (circles) and a = 20 (squares), b = 10\u22122 . The fixed\nstarting position x0 and the potential parameters p and q are the same of Fig. 2.\n\nevident in panel (b) as \u03c4max increases with \u03c1.\nIt is interesting to show the probability density function (PDF) of stock price returns for\nthe model described by the Eqs. (4). This is done in Fig. 5. As one can see the qualitative\nbehavior of a fat tail distribution, typical of real financial market data, is recovered [9, 10],\nbut with a peculiar asymmetry. To characterize quantitatively the PDF of returns (Fig. 5)\nas regards the width, the asymmetry and the fatness of the distribution, we calculate the\nmean value < \u2206x >, the variance \u03c3\u2206x , the skewness \u03ba3 and the kurtosis \u03ba4 . We obtained the\nfollowing values: < \u2206x >= \u22120.434, \u03c3\u2206x = 0.903, \u03ba3 = \u22122.086, \u03ba4 = 9.417. These statistical\nquantities clearly show the asymmetry of the distribution and its leptokurtic nature observed\nin empirical investigations, characterized by a narrow and larger maximum, and by fatter\ntails than in the Gaussian distribution [9, 10].\nThe presence of the asymmetry is very interesting and it will be subject of future inves8\n\n\fFIG. 5: Probability density function of stock price returns for the Heston model with a metastable\nstate and correlated noise sources (Eqs. (4)). The parameters of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process of\nEqs. (4) are: a = 2, b = 0.01, c = 26. The cross correlation coefficient is \u03c1 = \u22120.3. The potential\nparameters are the same of Fig. 2.\n\ntigations. It is worthwhile to note, however, that the PDF of returns become asymmetric\nin crash and rally days [33, 34], that are just the time periods of financial data where the\nrelated dynamical regimes could be described by the models (2) and (4). Of course the\nquantitative agreement between the PDF of real data and that obtained from these models\nrequires further investigations on the parameter value choice of the cubic potential, the parameters of the simple Heston model and the correlation coefficient. This analysis is outside\nthe aim of the present work and will be further investigated in a forthcoming paper.\nFinally in the following Fig. 6 we report the comparison between the probability density\nfunction of the escape times of daily price returns from real market data and that obtained\nfrom the model described by the Eqs. (4). The data set used here consists of daily closure\nprices for 1071 stocks traded at the NYSE and continuously present in the 12-year period\n1987 \u2212 1998 (3030 trading days). The same data were used in previous investigations by\none of the authors [20, 35, 36]. From this data set we obtained the time series of the returns\nand we calculated the time to hit a fixed threshold starting from a fixed initial position.\nThe two thresholds were chosen as a fraction of the standard deviation \u03c3n observed for\neach stock during the above mentioned whole time period (n is the stock index, varying\nbetween 1 and 1071). Specifically we chose: (\u2206xi )n = \u22120.1\u03c3n and (\u2206xf )n = \u22121.0\u03c3n . The\n9\n\n\fparameters of the CIR process are: a = 20, b = 0.01, c = 2.4. The cross correlation\ncoefficient is \u03c1 = \u22120.9, and the potential parameters are the same of Fig. 2. As one can\nsee the agreement between real and theoretical data is very good, except at small escape\ntimes. The choice of this parameter data set is not based on a fitting procedure as that used\nfor example in Ref. [21], where the minimization of the mean square deviation between the\nPDF of the returns extracted from financial data and that obtained theoretically is done.\nWe chose the parameter set in the range in which we observe the nonmonotonic behaviour\nof the mean escape time as a function of the parameters b and c. Then by a trial and error\nprocedure we selected the values of the parameters a, b, and c for which we obtain the best\nfitting between the PDF of escape times of the price returns calculated from the modified\nHeston model (Eqs. (4)) and that obtained from time series of real market data. Of course a\nbetter quantitative procedure could be done, by considering also the potential parameters.\nThis will be done, together with a detailed analysis of PDF of returns and its asymmetry,\nin a forthcoming paper.\n\n10\n\nPDF\n\n10\n\nreal data\ntheoretical results\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n50\n\n100\n\nescape time (days)\nFIG. 6: Comparison between the probability density function of escape times of the price returns\nfor the modified Heston model with a metastable state (Eqs.

The cross correlation coefficient between the noise sources\nis: \u03c1 = \u22120.9.\n\n10\n\n\fIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the statistical properties of the escape time in a generalized Heston\nmarket model, characterized by the presence of a metastable state in the effective potential\nof the logarithm of the price p(t). We observe the NES effect in the system investigated.\nThe presence of correlation between the stochastic volatility and the noise source which\naffects directly the dynamics of the quantity x(t) = ln p(t) (as in usual market models), can\ninfluence the stability of the market. Specifically a positive correlation between x(t) and\nvolatility v(t) slows down the walker escape process, that is it delays the crash phenomenon\nby increasing the stability of the market. A negative correlation on the contrary accelerates\nthe escape process, lowering the stability of the system.\n\nThis work was partially supported by MIUR.\n\n[1] R.N. Mantegna and B. Spagnolo, Phys.
