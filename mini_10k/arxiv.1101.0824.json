Introduction\nThe strength of disordered materials depends on multiple characteristic length scales,\nranging from the macroscopic size of the sample over the sizes of pre-existing cracks down\nto characteristic length scales of the disordered microstructure. Sample size dependence\nis commonly related to the concept of a 'weakest link': Larger samples on average\ncontain more weak parts and thus, provided failure is governed by the weakest part\nof the microstructure (e.g., the largest crack), they are likely to fail at lower stress.\nThis argument puts the size dependence of failure firmly into the realm of extreme\nvalue statistics. Samples containing a single large crack, on the other hand, fall into\nan entirely different category: As failure is governed by the supercritical propagation of\nthis crack, the behavior is expected to depend on the crack size but \u2013 at least in the\nlarge sample limit where boundary effects are negligible \u2013 not on the size of the sample.\nIn disordered quasi-brittle materials, the above arguments must be used with\ncaution. In such materials, large flaws can emerge from the collective dynamics of\ninteracting microcracks. Thus, the concepts of 'weakest link' or 'critical flaw' are far\n\n\fSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\n2\n\nfrom straightforward \u2013 rather than being fixed pre-existing entities, weak zones and the\nassociated length scales may need to be envisaged as emergent features of the complex\ndynamics of interacting defects. At the same time, the properties of pre-existing cracks\nare strongly influenced by their interactions with the disordered microstructure, which\nmay give rise to crack front roughening [1, 2], the formation of self-affine fracture surfaces\n[3], [4] and the correlated nucleation of microcracks in a process zone ahead of the crack\ntip [6].\nThe fracture behavior of structurally disordered materials has been studied in\nnumerous investigations (for overview, see [5]). The size dependence of failure stresses\nin pre-cracked samples, which is in the focus of the present study, has been investigated\nfor two-dimensional disordered sheets by Alava and co-workers [6]. In that study, the\ncrack was one-dimensional and contained within the plane of the sheet. In the present\nstudy, we also consider a two-dimensional system (a thin elastic film) but the crack is\nin the present case two-dimensional and runs parallel to the plane of the film. This\ncan be envisaged as a delamination problem: we are dealing with a crack running along\na weak interface where the film is tethered to a rigid substrate. Failure is induced by\nshear tractions that are applied to the free surface of the film. The considered geometry\nis found in several physical applications, ranging from abrasive wear of coatings and\nshear-induced delamination of thin films to geophysical problems such as the failure of\nslopes by shear band formation [7] and the initiation of snow slab avalanches by failure\nof weak interfaces in snow stratifications [8, 9]. From a theoretical point of view, a\nmotivation for studying this system lies in the fact that the two-dimensional crack has\nadditional degrees of freedom which, as we shall see, may lead to behavior which differs\nfrom that of one-dimensional cracks.\n2. Formulation of the model\nWe consider an elastic film of thickness D tethered to a rigid substrate. The film is\nmodeled as a regular network of identical coil springs of unit length and stiffness I. The\n(discrete) coordinates of the network nodes are denoted by X, Y , the network size is\nL \u00d7 L, and the origin of the coordinate system is located in the centre of the system.\nThe interface with the substrate is represented by breakable coil springs which connect\neach node to a rigid support as shown schematically in Figure 1. We assume that the\ncoil springs restrict displacements to be in the X direction only, thus we are dealing\nwith a scalar displacement field U := UX . The system is driven by an external shear\nforce \u03a3 acting in the X direction. This force is applied uniformly to all nodes of the\nnetwork.\nThe leaf springs break at the uniform critical extension UC = 2. Structural\nrandomness of the interface is modelled as quenched disorder in the form of random\nvariations of the fracture energies WF or, equivalently, of the leaf spring stiffnesses K =\n2WF /UC2 = WF /2. These are assumed as independent identically distributed random\nvariables with Weibull distribution, P (WF ) = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212(WF /W0 )\u03b2 ]. The parameter W0\n\n\fSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the model studied in this paper: A thin elastic\nfilm is connected by a cohesive interface to a rigid substrate; the film is loaded by\nshear tractions applied to its free surface. The film is modelled as a regular network of\nidentical coil springs, while the interface is represented by breakable leaf springs which\nconnect the nodes of this network to a rigid support.\n\nis chosen such that the mean value hWF i = W0 \u0393(1 + 1/\u03b2) = 1 where \u0393(x) denotes the\nGamma function. Different degrees of randomness canqbe introduced by varying the\nexponent \u03b2 and thus the coefficient of variation CV = \u0393(1 + 2/\u03b2)/(\u0393(1 + 1/\u03b2))2 \u2212 1\nof the distribution. A crack is introduced by removing all leaf springs over the cracked\narea. We consider two crack geometries: (i) a crack of width 2A in the X direction that\nis located in the system centre and spans the system in Y direction, and (ii) a circular\ncrack of radius A in the centre of the system.\nWe note that a scalar model very similar to the present one was studied by Zapperi\net. al. [10]. The main differences between both models concern the crack geometry and\ndriving method: Zapperi et. al,. consider straight cracks that cut from one edge of the\nsystem halfway into the interface, and drive these by imposing a growing displacement\non the cracked edge of the film. This geometry could be adapted to study size effects\nin systems with straight cracks, but it is not well suited for circular crack geometries.\nIn the limit of slowly varying displacement fields, the force equilibrium condition\nfor our model can be written in the following continuum approximation:\nI\n\n\u22022U\n\u22022U\n+\n\u2202X 2 \u2202Y 2\n\n!\n\n+ \u03a3 \u2212 T (U, X, Y ) = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T is the local characteristics of the leaf springs representing the interface:\nWF (X, Y )U\n,\n2\nT (U, X, Y ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0, U > 2.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nU \u2264 2,\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\n\nSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\nWe note that Eq. (1) can be obtained from a long-wavelength approximation to the\ncontinuum equations describing stress equilibrium in a thin film under shear loads.\nThe non-dimensional variables of the present model can thus be related to the physical\nand geometrical parameters of the thin film problem. The derivation has been given\nelsewhere [2, 11] and we refer the reader to those previous studies for making the link\nwith 'real' physical systems.\n3. Displacement fields, critical crack lengths and critical stresses for linear\nand circular cracks\nFor analysing the behavior of cracks in finite disordered systems, it is useful to first\nconsider the same crack geometry in a system without disorder (WF (X, Y ) = WF ) and\nof infinite extension. We envisage two crack geometries, namely (i) a linear crack of\nextension 2A in the X direction which spans the system in the Y direction, and (ii) a\ncircular crack of diameter 2A.\nWe first consider a linear crack. A critical crack is characterized by the fact that\nthe displacement on the crack line (in this case the lines X = \u00b1A) has the critical value\nU = 2. With the additional requirement that the displacement gradient must vanish at\ninfinity, we find that the solution of Eqs. (1) and (2) is given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nU(X) = \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u03a3 2\n(A \u2212 X 2 ) + 2, |X| \u2264 A,\n2I\n\uf8ee s\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\n\u0012\nW\n2\u03a3\n2\u03a3\nF\nexp \uf8f0\u2212\n+ 2\u2212\n|X \u2212 A|\uf8fb ,\nWF\nWF\n2I\n\n(3)\n|X| > A.\n\nThe critical crack length follows from the requirement that the displacement must be\ndifferentiable at |X| = A:\n\u221a\n2WF I\nA=\n\u2212 A\u2217\n(4)\n\u03a3\nq\n\nwhere A\u2217 = 2I/WF is a characteristic length which governs the exponential decay of\ndisplacement and stress fields ahead of the crack tip. We note that the present relation\n\u03a3(A + A\u2217 ) \u221d\n\nq\n\nWF\n\n(5)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nrepresents a scaling that is different from Griffith's classical relation \u03a3 A \u221d Wf for\nbulk cracks (which also holds for linear cracks in thin sheets as studied by Alava et. al.\n[6]). The different scaling reflects the fact that in case of a thin film, stress relaxation\ndue to crack opening is confined to a volume that is limited by the film thickness (which\nis unity in the present non-dimensional representation). The characteristic length A\u2217\nenters the expression (5) as an extension of the actual crack length A, i.e., it acts in\na similar manner as the process zone size Ap in Bazant's\ngeneralization of Griffith's\nq\n\u221a\nrelation to bulk cracks in semi-brittle materials [12], \u03a3 A + Ap \u221d Wf .\n\n\f5\n\nSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\nFor a circular crack we transform Eq.\n\u221a\nR = X 2 + Y 2 we have\nI\n\n\u22022U\n1 \u2202U\n+\n2\n\u2202R\nR \u2202R\n\n!\n\n(1) to cylindrical coordinates.\n\n+ \u03a3 \u2212 T (U) = 0 .\n\nWith\n\n(6)\n\nAgain, for a critical crack we require the displacement to assume the critical value U = 2\non the crack line R = A. The solution is then\n\uf8f1\n\u03a3 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(A \u2212 R2 ) + 2, R \u2264 A,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n4I\n\uf8f2\nq\nU(X) = \uf8f4\n(7)\n\u0013 K ( W /(2I)R)\n\u0012\nF\n2\u03a3\n2\u03a3\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nq\n,\nR\n>\nA,\n+\n2\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 WF\nWF K0 ( WF /(2I)A)\n\nwhere Kn is the nth-order modified Bessel function of the second kind. The condition\nfor matching the derivatives at R = A becomes\nq\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nK1 ( WF /(2I)A\n\u03a3A\n2\u03a3 q\nq\nWF /2I\nU \u2032 (A) =\n.\n= 2\u2212\n2I\nWF\nK0 ( WF /(2I)A)\n\n(8)\n\nThis is readily analyzed in the limit A \u226b 1 where our underlying continuum\napproximation is expected to be valid. The first and second order modified Bessel\nfunctions have the same asymptotic behavior and their ratio rapidly converges to unity.\nThus, we obtain the following condition relating stress and critical crack radius:\n!\n\u221a\n2WF I\n(9)\n\u2212 A\u2217\nA=2\n\u03a3\nThis relation is (but for a factor of 2) identical to that for a linear crack. In both cases,\nplots of the inverse stress vs. the critical crack length are expected to produce a straight\n\u221a\nline with positive A-axis intercept, 1/\u03a3 = sA + a where a = A\u2217 / 2WF I = 1/WF. The\n\u221a\n\u221a\nslope of this plot is expected to be s = 1/ 2WF I for linear and s = 1/(2 2WF I) for\ncircular cracks.\n4. Simulations of disordered systems\nIn our simulations of disordered systems the coil spring constants I were set to unity\nand leaf spring constants were assigned randomly from a Weibull distribution with\nexponent \u03b2 and mean value hKi = 1/2 (hWF i = 1). System sizes were varied between\nL = 10 and L = 160. To introduce a linear crack of width 2A we simply removed all\nleaf springs within a strip of this width in the centre of the system. Thus the crack\nwidths investigated are integer numbers. Circular cracks were introduced by choosing\na number B, removing all leaf springs\nfor which X 2 + Y 2 < B 2 , and then evaluating\nq\nthe 'radius' of the crack as A = N/\u03c0 where N is the number of removed springs. For\neach set of parameters (\u03b2, L, A) we performed \u2013 depending on system size \u2013 typically\n103 simulations with different realizations of the quenched disorder.\nSimulations were performed in the standard manner for a random spring model. We\nsolve the force equilibrium equations in the small-displacement approximation for unit\n\n\f6\n\nSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\napplied stress and identify the leaf spring with the largest displacement \u00db . The external\nstress is then multiplied with \u03a3 = 2/\u00db such that this spring has the critical displacement\nU = 2, and the leaf spring is removed. We then again solve the equilibrium equations\nand identify the leaf spring with the largest displacement. If this exceeds the critical\nlevel, this spring is also removed and the process is repeated until a new equilibrium\nconfiguration is found where U < 2 for all sites where leaf springs are still in place. We\nthen again identify the leaf spring with the largest displacement, multiply the external\nstress with 2/\u00db , remove the spring, and so on until global failure of the interface occurs,\ndefined in this case as the failure of all leaf springs.\nResults are shown in Figure 2 for circular cracks, and in Figure 3 for linear cracks.\nFor circular cracks, two different types of behavior can be observed. At small crack\nradii, the failure stress is approximately independent of the crack radius A and has\nthe same value as in a crack-free system. This failure stress has a logarithmic system\nsize dependence as shown in the inset of Figure 3. At large crack radii, on the other\nhand, the failure stress is system size independent but depends on the crack radius.\nThis dependence is similar to what we expect for a system without disorder: the plot\nof 1/\u03a3 vs. A shows a linear dependence. The slope s and axis intercept a of this linear\nregime do not depend on system size. They exhibit only a weak disorder dependence as\nshown in the inset of Figure 2.

Discussion and Conclusions\nThe behavior we observe for circular cracks is analogous to the behavior of linear cracks\nin thin sheets described by Alava et. al. [6]. The cross-over between a system-size\ndependent but crack-size independent regime at small crack sizes, and a crack-size\ndependent but system-size independent regime at large crack sizes, can be understood\nin terms of a transition between crack-nucleation-controlled and crack-propagationcontrolled failure. If the radius of the pre-existing crack is small, the stress needed\nfor its propagation may be high enough to nucleate another critical crack in another\npart of a sufficiently large system. In this case, failure is not controlled by the initial\ncrack but by crack nucleation in a 'weakest spot' elsewhere. This has been shown to\ngive, in a thin-film geometry similar to the present one, rise to a logarithmic system\nsize dependence of the failure stress [11]. If the radius of the pre-existing crack is large\nenough, on the other hand, failure is governed by propagation of this crack and does not\n\n\fSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\n8\n\ndepend on system size. The crack length dependence of the failure stress matches the\nexpectation from deterministic fracture mechanics: We find a linear dependence of the\ninverse failure stress on crack length, 1/\u03a3 = a+sA. The parameters a and s of the linear\nfit exhibit a weak, approximately linear dependence on the coefficient of variation of the\nfailure energy distribution. The slope s, which in deterministic fracture mechanics is\n\u221a\nproportional to s \u221d 1/ WF , decreases slightly with increasing disorder. This indicates\na disorder-induced increase of the effective fracture energy, which can be understood\nas a consequence of crack front roughening and crack pinning as discussed in [2]. The\naxis intercept a, by contrast, increases with increasing disorder. This behavior cannot\nbe understood in terms of an increase in effective fracture energy. Rather, we may\ninterpret the increase of a (or of A\u2217 ) as a consequence of an advance of the crack beyond\nthe initial crack line that is associated with crack front roughening under subcritical\nloads, an effect that becomes more pronounced as the disorder increases [2].\nHow can we understand the different size-dependent behavior of linear cracks? The\nobvious difference between the two geometries is that, for a crack spanning the entire\nsystem, the length of the crack line is equal to the system size whereas for a circular\ncrack, it is proportional to the crack radius. As demonstrated in [2], crack lines in\ninterface fracture exhibit self-affine roughening, but the regime of correlated roughening\nis confined to scales less than the crack width A. Above this scale, the critical crack can\nenvisaged as a sequence of independently pinned segments of length \u223c A. Supercritical\ncrack propagation can be triggered by the depinning and expansion of any of these\nsegments. Accordingly, the system strength is governed by the weakest link along the\ncrack line. The validity of this weakest-link argument can be directly demonstrated\nby analyzing the probability distributions of failure stresses: If the argument is valid,\n(n)\nthe distribution PL (\u03a3) of the minimum failure stress determined from n independent\nsimulations of systems of size L must be equal to the distribution PnL (\u03a3) of the failure\n(n)\nstress of a system of size nL. The n-th extremal distribution PL is calculated from\nthe underlying distribution PL using the basic relation of extreme value statistics:\n(n)\n(n)\nPL (\u03a3) = 1 \u2212 [1 \u2212 PL (\u03a3)]n . Results of a comparison between PnL and PL for different\nvalues of L and n are shown in Figure 4. It is evident that the weakest-link argument\nworks quite well. We note, however, that the same is not true for system sizes that are\ncomparable to the crack length A (such as L = 20 for the parameters used in Figure\n4). We attribute this to the correlated nature of the dynamics on scales < A, which\nprecludes the use of simple weakest-link arguments.\nEstablishing the nature of the associated size effect requires understanding of the\nfunctional nature of the failure stress distribution. Fitting the observed distributions\nindicates that, among the stable extreme value distributions, only the Gumbel\ndistribution P (\u03a3) = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212 exp(C(\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a30 )] does an acceptable job. Evidently,\nthis implies a logarithmic size effect as observed in the simulations.\nIn conclusion, the present investigation demonstrates that the additional degrees\nof freedom associated with 2D as compared to 1D cracks may give rise to additional\ntypes of size dependent behavior.

The latter mechanism,\nwhich characterizes the process zone of linear cracks in 2D sheets where it leads to\nscreening of crack-tip stress concentrations [6], is irrelevant in the present case where\nelastic couplings are short ranged: In the present geometry, stress and displacement\nfields ahead of the crack decay exponentially even in the absence of disorder, hence,\nthe crack has negligible influence on its wider surroundings. In case of linear systemspanning cracks, failure is governed by the depinning of a crack-line segment with a\nwidth of the order of the crack length. Since system failure depends on the pinning\nstrength of the weakest segment along the crack line, this gives rise to a size dependence\nof the failure stresses at all crack lengths. The nature of the failure stress distributions,\nas well as direct determination of the mean failure stresses for different system sizes,\nindicate a logarithmic size effect.\nOf course, a most interesting question concerns the size-dependent behavior of 2D\ncracks in bulk systems where both crack front roughening and damage accumulation\nahead of the crack tip are likely to operate simultaneously. The interplay of these\ntwo mechanisms, the concomitant process zone characteristics, and the resulting size\neffects remain a task for further studies relying on much more substantial deployment\nof computer power.\n\n\fSize scaling of strength in thin film delamination\n\n10\n\nReferences\n[1] Delaplace A, Schmittbuhl J, and Maloy K J,High resolution description of a crack front in a\nheterogeneous Plexiglas block, 1999, Phys.
