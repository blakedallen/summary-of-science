I NTRODUCTION\nAerogels are materials with density and refractive index\nin the region between gases and liquids or solids. Already\nsome time ago, Cantin et al. [1] proposed that Cherenkov\nradiation from silica aerogels could be used for detection of\nparticles. Besides particle detectors like for example TASSO\n[2], such threshold counters found applications also in other\nfields [3]. With improved manufacturing techniques, aerogels of\nhigher transparency i.e. less Rayleigh scattering became available, permitting their consideration as radiators in Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) counters [4]. Ypsilantis and Seguinot\n[5] proposed a combined aerogel+gas, mirror-focused RICH\ncounter for the LHC-B experiment at CERN. The HERMES\nteam [6] constructed and operated such a ring imaging detector\nat DESY. The present paper reports on experimental investigation of an aerogel based RICH detector not requiring mirrors\ni.e. of the proximity focusing type.

T HE EXPERIMENTAL SET- UP\nInitial tests of the apparatus with cosmic rays were reported\nrecently [9]. The present paper describes measurements and\nresults obtained with the \u03c0 2 beam at KEK. A beam particle pion, muon or electron - traversing the apparatus is signaled by\ntwo 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 scintillation counters which determine the time\nof arrival. Two CO2 gas Cherenkov counters produce signals\nonly upon the passage of electrons so these signals could be\nused either to select or to exclude electrons.\nThe aerogel radiator and the position sensitive, single photon\ndetector are contained in a light tight box (Fig. 1), of which\nthe entrance and exit sides each have a multiwire proportional\nchamber for measuring the track of the incident particle. These\n5\u00d75 cm2 MWPC's, with 15 \u03bcm diameter, gold-plated tungsten\nanode wires at 2 mm pitch and with 90% Ar + 10% CH4 gas\nflow, are read out by delay lines on the x and y cathode wires.\nAfter passing through the entrance MWPC, the charged\nparticle hits the aerogel radiator in which it emits Cherenkov\nphotons. Measurements have been made mainly with 2 cm\nthick aerogel slabs of n = 1.029, n = 1.05 and n =\n1.07, produced by the method described in [10]. The position\nsensitive detector of Cherenkov photons is situated 17-29 cm\ndownstream of the aerogel, depending on the refractive index\nvalue of the specific aerogel. The detector is a 6 \u00d7 6 array\nof 16 channel multianode photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu\n\n\fN\ny(mm)\n\ny(mm)\n\n180\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n1200\n1000\n800\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n160\n\n150\n\nx(mm)\n\ny(mm)\n\ny(mm)\n\nx(mm)\n180\n\n180\n\n600\n400\n\n160\n\n140\n\n140\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n/ 25\n1292.\n0.2334\n0.1201E-01\n25.85\n-29.88\n\nA\nMean\nSigma\nP0\nP1\n\n160\n\n140\n\n0\n\n41.07\n\n1400\n\n180\n\n200\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\n\nCherenkov angle \u03b8c(rad)\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nx(mm)\n\n150\n\nx(mm)\n\nFig. 3\nT HE DISTRIBUTION OF C HERENKOV ANGLES MEASURED FOR 3 G E V/c\nPIONS , RADIATING IN AN n = 1.029 AEROGEL RADIATOR .\n\nFig. 2\nS OME EXAMPLES OF EVENT HIT PATTERNS .

The sensitive surface of the M16 PMT is divided\ninto 16 (= 4 \u00d7 4) channels, each covering 4.5 \u00d7 4.5 mm2 . It\nfollows that only 36% of the detector area is occupied by the\nphotosensitive channels, the rest being dead space. The photon\ndetection system and the aerogel radiator tile may be rotated\naround an axis perpendicular to the beam direction, enabling\nmeasurements of angular acceptance i.e. measurements of the\nnumber of detected Cherenkov photons as a function of the\ncharged particle incident angle.\nThe PMTs are plugged into voltage divider boards inside the\nlight tight box with signals passing through connectors to the\nreadout system located outside the box. The PMT anode signals\nare first discriminated and then recorded by CAMAC multihit,\nmultichannel TDCs, for which the common STOP is provided\nby the scintillation counter signals. The TDC information is\nstored for later analysis in a personal computer.\nAs only 196 readout channels were available for the 576\nPMT anode outputs, only part of the system could be read out\nwith the 4.5 mm pixel size. However, by connecting 4 (= 2\u00d72)\nanodes to one readout channel, the entire system could be read\nout with 9 mm pixel size.\nIII. M EASUREMENT AND\n\nRESULTS\n\nA few typical events are displayed in Fig. 2. From the photon\nhit position and the measured direction of the incident charged\n\nparticle, the Cherenkov angle is calculated. Accumulated distributions of hits, depending on their Cherenkov angles, are\nplotted in Figs. 3 and 4. Peaks and rings, corresponding to\npions, muons and electrons, are clearly visible. Signals from\nthe gas Cherenkov counters may be used for either selecting or\nexcluding electrons. Fitting these distributions with Gaussian\npeaks and linear backgrounds yields the average values and\nstandard deviations of the measured Cherenkov angles.\nThe main contributions to the resolution in Cherenkov angle\nas determined from a single photon (standard deviations of\nthe peaks in distributions of Figs. 3 and 4) come from pixel\nsize and from uncertainty in the emission point. For normal\nincidence of tracks the\n\u221a first contribution could be estimated as\n\u03c3pix = d*cos2 \u03b8ch /X 12, where d is the pixel size, \u03b8ch is the\nCherenkov angle and X is the distance from aerogel to detector.\n\u221a\nThe second contribution is \u03c3emp = L* sin\u03b8ch *cos\u03b8ch /X 12,\nwhere L is the aerogel thickness. The uncertainty in the track\ndirection is negligible at 3 GeV/c, but increases at lower\nmomenta. The error due to dispersion in the radiator (chromatic error) should also be negligible, but contributions could\narise due to possible non-uniformities of the aerogel (position\nvariations in refractive index), non-flat aerogel surface, forward\nscattering of photons etc.\nThe measured Cherenkov angle resolution, i.e. the standard\ndeviation of peaks in distributions of photon hits versus the\nvalue of aerogel refractive index, is shown in Fig. 5 for 3 GeV/c\npions. Different data points in the figure refer to different values\nof parameters such as the radiator thickness, the radiator-tophoton-detector distance and the photon detector pixel size.

It may be seen from the figure\nthat such estimates give a good approximation to the measured\nresolution.\nThe other important parameter of a RICH counter is the\nnumber of detected photons per incident charged particle. This\nis usually parametrised as Ndet = N0 * L * sin2 \u03b8ch , where\n\u03b8ch is the Cherenkov angle, L is the radiator thickness and\nN0 is a figure of merit depending on the radiator and system\ntransparency, geometrical acceptance of photons (area and\nangle), quantum efficiency, photoelectron collection efficiency\netc. Due to Rayleigh scattering, the aerogel transparency has\na strong wavelength dependence in the region of R5900-M16\nPMT quantum efficiency, so one may expect a sensitivity of the\nnumber of detected photons on the particular aerogel sample i.e.\non the production procedure. The number of detected photons\nper Cherenkov ring is shown in Fig. 6 for 3 GeV/c pions.\nFirst one notices that the number of photons does not increase\nwith refractive index as may be expected for \u03b2 = 1 particles;\nNdet \u221d sin2 \u03b8ch = 1 \u2212 1/n2 . Then it is also obvious that\nthe 4 cm thick aerogel radiator does not produce two times\nas many photons as does the 2 cm thick aerogel. And finally\nwe see that the 2.8 cm thick aerogel tile [12], produced in a\n\ndifferent process [13], yields more Cherenkov photons than the\n4 cm thick aerogel [10]. That a higher refractive index of the\naerogel sample does not necessarily produce more photons, is\nobserved also in Fig. 7. Although the threshold for n = 1.05\nis reached, as expected, at lower particle momenta than for\nn = 1.029, the saturated number of detected photons per\nCherenkov ring is more or less the same for both radiators.\nThe above discrepancies can be well understood, and have been\nestimated from the known aerogel attenuation lengths and the\nresponse of the counter (Fig. 6). The attenuation lengths at\n400 nm for the samples of Fig. 6 are 36 mm, 15 mm and\n7 mm for the aerogel samples with n = 1.029, n = 1.05\nand n = 1.07, respectively, and 36 mm for the 28 mm thick\nNovosibirsk sample with n = 1.05 [12].\nIt has been already noted by the HERMES group [6], that a\nloss of Cherenkov photons occurs at the side wall boundaries\nbetween adjacent aerogel tiles. We have confirmed this finding\nby measuring the number of photons on the Cherenkov ring\nas a function of the distance of the charged particle impact\npoint from the boundary between two tiles. The measurement\nis shown in Fig. 8, where a dip is seen at the tile boundary\nx = 0 mm.

The result clearly indicates the\nreduction of yield when the charged particle is closer than about\n5 mm to the boundary of a 2 cm thick n = 1.05 aerogel tile. It\nis worth noting that a simple model, where all photons hitting\nthe boundary between the two tiles get lost, accounts for most\nof the observed dependence.\nIV. C ONCLUSIONS\nWe have constructed and tested a proximity focusing RICH\ndetector module with aerogel as radiator and multianode PMTs\nas position sensitive detectors of individual Cherenkov photons. The measured values of the basic parameters i.e. the\nsingle photon Cherenkov angle resolution and the number of\nphotons detected per Cherenkov ring, look promising. The\nresolution is in relatively good agreement with estimates based\non pixel size and emission point uncertainty. The number of\ndetected photons, however is sensitive to the particular aerogel\nused. It seems that these differences are due to Rayleigh\nscattering, which reduces the aerogel transparency mainly in\nthe wavelength region of maximal photocathode sensitivity.\nPhotomultipier tubes with a higher fraction of active area,\npossibly combined with a light collection system, consisting\nof lenses or light guides, are expected to increase the number\nof detected Cherenkov photons by reducing the dead space of\nthe photon detector. The increase in photon yield, however, is\n\nRelative response\n\nCORRESPONDING DATA .\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-7.5\n\n-5\n\n-2.5\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n10\nx track(mm)\n\nFig. 8\nT HE RELATIVE NUMBER OF C HERENKOV PHOTONS DETECTED ON THE\nRING , AS A FUNCTION OF THE CHARGED PARTICLE IMPACT POINT\nDISTANCE FROM THE SIDE WALL OF THE AEROGEL TILE .\n\nT HE VALUES\n\nSHOWN ARE NORMALIZED TO THE MEASURED VALUES IN CASE OF A\nSINGLE TILE COVERING THE FULL RANGE .\n\nA LSO SHOWN IS THE ESTIMATE\n\nOF A SIMPLE MODEL ( DASHED CURVE ).\n\n\fin the latter case at the expense of an increase in the effective\npixel size, so a compromise, optimizing the final resolution of\nthe charged particle Cherenkov angle should be found.\nThe information obtained from the results of the present tests\nsuggests that a proximity focusing aerogel RICH as required by\nthe BELLE particle identification upgrade is feasible, so investigations of optimal detector parameters are being continued.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] M.
