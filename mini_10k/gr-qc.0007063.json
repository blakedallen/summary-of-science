The most intriguing among them are spacetimes with a region (or\nregions) containing closed time-like curves (CTC's). These time-machine spacetimes will\nbe considered in the present paper. It is not clear whether the laws of physics permit the\ndevelopment of CTC's in the course of the evolution of a spacetime from some reasonable\ninitial conditions (see [1]-[3] and references therein). We will not concern this problem\nhere supposing that this is possible. Instead of this, taking spacetime geometry ad hoc,\nwe shall investigate evolution of quantum particles in this geometry.\nWe shall discuss only non-relativistic processes. In this case the spacetime can be\ndivided into chronal regions (regions without CTC's) and dischronal regions (containing\nCTC's) by slices t = const. For simplicity we shall discuss here the spacetime with only\none dischronal region. This dischronal region (located between time moments t1 and t2 )\nis preceded, at t < t1 , and followed, at t > t2 , by chronal regions. We shall call the first\nchronal region (at t < t1 ) the initial region, the second chronal region (at t > t2 ) the final\nregion, and the dischronal region (at t1 < t < t2 ) the time machine.\nIn a series of rather recent papers (see for example [4]-[11]) the question was analyzed\nwhether the standard laws of physics (classical and quantum) can accommodate, in a\nreasonable manner, a spacetime with CTC's. In this paper we shall focus our attention\non the problem of propagating non-relativistic non-interacting quantum particles in the\nspacetime with CTC's (the time-machine spacetime).\nThe main conclusion made in the paper is that, in the case when closed time-like\nlines exist, a sort of superselection (decoherence) may arise in certain conditions, i.e. the\nsuperposition principle may be partially violated. In this case the conventional unitary\ndescription is not applicable in the time-machine spacetime. Instead, description by a\nseries of partial evolution operators, obeying the generalized unitarity condition, must be\napplied. The description of this type has been earlier worked out in quantum theory of\n3\n\n\fcontinuous measurements.\nIt is well known now that the superposition principle of quantum mechanics is restricted when a measurement is performed. One may say that a sort of superselection\nexists in the situation of measurement, forbidding to superpose the states corresponding to\ndifferent superselection sectors. In the case of quantum measurements the superselection\nsectors correspond to different alternative measurement outputs. The term 'decoherence'\nis often applied to describe this situation [12]-[15].\nThe superselection (decoherence) takes a specific form if a continuous (prolonged in\ntime) measurement is performed (see [16]-[18] and references therein). In the procedure\nof path integration, those paths that are connected with different alternative outputs \u03b1\nof the continuous measurement, cannot be summed up. Instead of this, the amplitude A\u03b1\nof each of these alternatives must be calculated by summation of the paths corresponding\nto the alternative \u03b1. After this, the probability of each alternative \u03b1 can be found as a\nsquare modulus of the corresponding amplitude A\u03b1 . The sum of all these probabilities\nshould be equal to unity.\nThis is valid not only in the situation when the measurement is performed on purpose,\nbut also when a measurement-like interaction of the system of interest with its environment takes place. The latter means that information is recorded in the environment about\nthe state of the system or its evolution. This information may be described with the help\nof alternatives. Each alternative \u03b1 is a class of states or a class of paths of the system.\nDifferent classes should be considered as classical (decohering) alternatives. Superposition\nof amplitudes corresponding to different alternatives \u03b1 is forbidden.\nIn practice the situation of the type of a measurement arises each time when \"macroscopically distinct\" states (or ways of evolution) of the system exist. What states must\nbe considered to be macroscopically distinct, depends on what environment the system\nhas.\nThis dependence on environment may be illustrated by the well-known two-slit ex-\n\n4\n\n\fperiment. Propagation of the particle through the first or the second slit suggests two\nalternatives. Usually these are considered as quantum ('coherent', 'interfering') alternatives. One cannot know what of this alternative is actually realized. In this case\nsuperposition of paths describing propagating through different slits is possible, leading\nfinally to the well-known interference effect.\nHowever this consideration is valid only when the slits are in vacuum or in such a\nmedium which cannot distinguish between two alternatives. If the interaction with the\nmedium (environment) records information in this medium about what slit the particle\npropagates through, the situation is quite different and the preceding consideration is\nincorrect. It is possible of course to consider the environment and its interaction with the\nparticle explicitly. However the influence of the environment onto the particle may be\ntaken into account implicitly if one consider two alternatives (corresponding to the slits)\nto be classical ('non-coherent', 'incompatible'). Superposing the paths passing through\ndifferent slits is in this case forbidden. This is the basic idea of quantum theory of\nmeasurements. More complicated situations of continuous quantum measurements may\nbe found in [18].\nPropagating in a spacetime containing CTC's, a particle may travel backward in time.\nThis means that it can pass through some time interval (dischronal region) twice or more.\nLet the number of times the particle returns to its past be n. Then we have different\nways of propagation characterized by the number n (in fact, nothing else than a winding\nnumber arising from non-trivial topology of the time-machine spacetime).\nThe situations characterized by different numbers n are quite different from the physical point of view. For the given n the particle passes through the dischronal region (within\nthe time machine) n + 1 times. An observer in the dischronal region (within the time\nmachine) will see n + 1 particles existing simultaneously. Different values of n correspond\nto different numbers of particles in the dischronal region.\nHowever in non-relativistic quantum mechanics the number of particles is conserved,\n\n5\n\n\fand a superselection corresponding to this number usually arises. If it really arises, the\nstates corresponding to different numbers of particles may not be superposed.\nThe superselection (decoherence) connected with the number of particles is not absolute. It takes place for a massive particle possessing a charge of some type (for example\nelectric charge) or spin (spinor charge). Even for such particles the decoherence exists only\n\"in normal conditions\". The latter means that the environment (consisting for example of\nphotons) distinguishes between the states with different numbers of particles. Then any\nsuperposition of such states will decohere very quickly so that the superpositions may be\nconsidered to be forbidden, not existing.\nThis may be invalid in special conditions. Superpositions of the states with different\nnumbers of particles exist for example in the superfluid (liquid helium at low temperature).\nIn this case the environment does not distinguish between different numbers of particles,\nand no superselection connected with the particle number exists.\nIn all considerations of the present paper we shall suppose that the conditions in the\ndischronal region of the time machine are \"normal\" in this sense, i.e. they lead to superselection. Then the number of particles (of the considered type) existing simultaneously in\nthis region presents a classical alternative. If this number is equal to n+1, this means that\nthe particle n times returned from the future to the past. The situations corresponding\nto different n should be treated as non-coherent.\nThis presumption means that for the environment (medium) within the time machine\nalternative ways of propagation of the particle corresponding to different n are macroscopically distinct. One may say that a sort of measurement is performed in this case,\nand the result of the measurement is characterized by the number n. According to what\nhas been said above, the paths characterized by different winding numbers n should be\nconsidered as non-coherent ('decohering'). Their summation is forbidden. Only the paths\ncorresponding to the same n may be summed up forming corresponding propagators and\nevolution operators Un .1 Propagators and evolution operators with different n should not\n1\n\nFor evolution into or from the dischronal region summing over the nth class of paths is insufficient,\n\n6\n\n\fbe summed up.\nHence, in the case when the superselection of different n takes place, the \"general\"\nevolution operator U =\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn (equal to the sum over all paths) makes no sense, and the\n\nevolution of the particle in a time-machine spacetime must be described in terms of the\n'partial evolution operators' Un . We shall develop this way of description including proof of\ngeneralized unitarity\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1 and generalized multiplicativity Um (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) Un (t\u2032 , t) =\n\nUm+n (t\u2032\u2032 , t). The evolution in a chronal region, between two chronal regions and within\nthe dischronal region (within the time machine) will be considered. The resulting theory\nwill be compared with the conventional (coherent) description of evolution as given in\n[11].\nThe paper is organized in the following way. In Sect. 2 general information about\npropagators and evolution operators in conventional theory is given, and an analogue of\nthis formalism is presented (taken from quantum theory of measurement) for the case when\nthe superposition principle is restricted by superselection. In Sect. 3 the superselection\nsectors (coherency sectors) are defined corresponding to the topological classes of particle\ntrajectories in the time-machine spacetime. On the basis of this definition in Sects. 4, 5\nthe generalized unitarity and in Sect. 6 the generalized multiplicativity of evolution in\nthe time-machine spacetime is proven. In Sect. 7 the results obtained are compared with\nthe conventional unitary description of evolution in the time-machine spacetime. Special\nkind of states 'trapped' within the time machine are described in Sect. 8. Sect. 9 contains\nshort concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\nPropagators, Paths and Measurements\n\nIn the conventional non-relativistic quantum mechanics the propagator K(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) is\na probability amplitude for the particle to transit from the point x\u2032 at time moment t\u2032 to\nand multiplication by a certain projector is needed to obtain Un , see Sect. 5.\n\n7\n\n\fthe point x\u2032\u2032 at time moment t\u2032\u2032 . The propagator may be considered as a kernel of the\nevolution operator U = U(t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ):\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c8 (x ) =\n\n\u03c8 = U(t , t ) \u03c8 ,\nt\u2032\u2032\n\nt\u2032\u2032\n\nt\u2032\n\nZ\n\nK(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) \u03c8t\u2032 (x\u2032 ) dx\u2032 .\n\n(1)\n\nAn explicit expression for the propagator is presented by the path integral,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nK(t , x |t , x ) =\n\nZ\n\ni\nS[x] ,\nd[x] exp\nh\u0304\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nwhere integration is performed over all paths [x] = {x(t)|t\u2032 \u2264 t \u2264 t\u2032\u2032 } connecting the\npoints (t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) and (t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 ), and S[x] is the action functional calculated along the path [x].\nThe evolution operator (propagator) satisfies the equation\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nU(t , t ) U(t , t) = U(t , t),\n\nZ\n\nK(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) K(t\u2032 , x\u2032 |t, x) dx\u2032 = K(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t, x)\n\n(3)\n\n(for t \u2264 t\u2032 \u2264 t\u2032\u2032 ) which we shall call the property of multiplicativity. Besides, the evolution\nshould conserve scalar products of the states, thus the evolution operator should be unitary\nthat may be written in terms of propagators as follows:\nZ\n\nK \u2217 (t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) K(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t, x) dx\u2032\u2032 = \u03b4(x\u2032 , x).\n\nThe formalism of propagators and evolution operators must however be modified if\na measurement or an observation of the system is performed. Such a modification is\nsuggested by quantum theory of measurements and particularly by quantum theory of\ncontinuous measurements (see [16]-[18] and references therein).\nThe main feature of the resulting formalism is that a set of classical alternatives \u03b1\nshould be considered. These alternatives arise as different measurement outputs. However, for emerging the situation of this type, it is not necessary that a measurement or an\nobservation be arranged on purpose. The only condition necessary for this is that some\ninformation about quantum system be recorded in classical form in its environment. In\nthe case of the time machine, the topological classes of trajectories described in Sect. 3\nwill play the role of classical alternatives.\n8\n\n\fThe alternatives \u03b1 are classical in the sense that they are incompatible. Correspondingly, quantum amplitudes corresponding to different alternatives cannot be summed up:\nthey are non-coherent. Particularly, instead of a single propagator K(t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) or a\nsingle evolution operator U(t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) a series of partial propagators K\u03b1 (t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) or partial\nevolution operators U\u03b1 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) are necessary for describing evolution of the system. The\npartial propagators have not to be summed up.\nHow the partial evolution operators may be used to describe the evolution of the\nmeasured system? This should be made in different ways in the case of selective situation\n(for example selective measurement) and non-selective one. Selective situation means that\nit is known what alternative \u03b1 is realized. The evolution is described in this case by one\npartial propagator or evolution operator U\u03b1 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ). The evolution law, in terms of the\nwave function (state vector) or the density matrix, is following:\n\u03c8t\u03b1\u2032 = U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t) \u03c8t ,\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03c1\u03b1t\u2032 = U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t) \u03c1t (U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t)) .\n\n(4)\n\nThe non-selective situation means that it is not known what concrete alternative\nis realized. In this case one should sum up over all possible alternatives. However,\ndealing with classical alternatives, one must sum up probabilities, not amplitudes. This\nmeans that summing must be performed in the second of the formulas (4) resulting in the\nfollowing evolution law:\n\u03c1t\u2032 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c1\u03b1t\u2032 =\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\nU\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t) \u03c1t (U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t)) .\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe final density matrix \u03c1t\u2032 has to be normalized (Tr\u03c1t\u2032 = 1) for any normalized initial\nmatrix \u03c1t . This takes place if and only if the following condition is fulfilled:\nX\n\n\u2020\n\n(U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t)) U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t) = 1.\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b1\n\nIt may be called the generalized unitarity condition. This condition means conservation\nof probability provided the probability of the alternative \u03b1 to belong to the set A of\n\n9\n\n\falternatives is defined as follows (see [18]):\nProb(\u03b1 \u2208 A) = Tr\n\nX\n\n\u03c1\u03b1t\u2032 = Tr\n\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\nU\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t) \u03c1t (U\u03b1 (t\u2032 , t)) .\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\u2032\u2032\n\nIf the alternatives (measurements) \u03b1tt\u2032 corresponding to different time intervals [t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ]\nmay be considered, their multiplication may be introduced,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03b2tt\u2032 \u03b1tt = \u03b3tt .\nThen the following multiplicative law should be valid [18] for the corresponding evolution\noperators (propagators):\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nU(\u03b2tt\u2032 ) U(\u03b1tt ) = U(\u03b3tt ),\n\nt \u2264 t\u2032 \u2264 t\u2032\u2032 .\n\n(8)\n\nAll these concepts, elaborated previously for continuous quantum measurements, may\nnow be applied to the alternatives corresponding to different topological numbers n in\nthe time-machine spacetime.\nIn the paper [11] the formalism of propagators in the form of path integrals has been\napplied to describe the evolution of a non-relativistic particle in the time-machine spacetime. The propagator for such a particle was defined as an integral over all paths. It\nwas shown that, in a simple model of the time-machine spacetime, unitarity and multiplicativity for the propagator are violated if at least one of the time moments is in the\ndischronal time interval.\nWe argued in Sect. 1 that a sort of superselection may arise in the time-machine spacetime for topologically different paths. If this is the case, then the \"general\" propagator\ndetermined by integrating over all paths makes no sense. Instead, one must use partial propagators just as in theory of continuous quantum measurements. Each of partial\npropagators should be a sum over topologically equivalent paths.2 Let us come over to\ndescription of the corresponding classes of paths and partial propagators.\n2\n\nThis is valid for the evolution from the past of the time machine to its future. For evolution into\n\nor from the time machine the sum over topologically equivalent paths should be multiplied by a certain\nprojector, see Sect. 5.\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nTopological Classes of Paths\n\nLet us consider the concrete model of a time-machine spacetime and define the topological\nclasses of trajectories of a non-relativistic particle in such a spacetime. We shall discuss\nhereafter the model of a time-machine spacetime that has been used in the paper [11]. It\nwill be evident though that at least some of the results have more general validity.\nThe spacetime under consideration may be constructed (see Fig. 1) from a usual,\n'chronal' one by adding two temporary wormholes. The original chronal spacetime will\nbe called the background spacetime. The wormholes added to the background spacetime\nconnect two space regions S1 and S2 belonging to the time slices t1 and t2 correspondingly,\nwith t1 \u2264 t2 . One of the wormholes W1 leads from the past region S1 to the future region\nS2 . This wormhole is entered if the region S1 is approached from its 'past side' (but not\nthrough the wormhole W2 ). Another wormhole W2 leads from the future region S2 to the\npast region S1 if the region S2 is approached from its 'past side' (but not through the\nwormhole W1 ). About the properties of walls of the wormholes see the paper [11].\nConsider all paths of a non-relativistic particle in this spacetime and divide them in\nthe topological classes. The classes will then be connected with non-coherent sectors\n(classical alternatives) in description of the particle evolution in the spacetime.\nThe first class is formed by the paths going through the 'future-directed' wormhole\nW1 , entering S1 and going out from S2 . Let us denote this class by P00 . The scheme of\nthe path belonging to this class is following:\nP00 : initial point \u2192 S1 \u2192 W1 \u2192 final point.\nOne more class P0 includes the paths lying completely in the background spacetime.\nThese paths bypass both entrances S1 and S2 to the wormholes. This is a class of topologically simple paths. The scheme of the paths of this class is following:\nP0 : initial point \u2192 final point.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 1: The time-machine spacetime is constructed from an usual (chronal) background\nspacetime by attaching two wormholes connecting two space regions in two different time\nslices. The wormhole W1 leads from the past to the future connecting the 'past side' of\nthe region S1 with the 'future side' of the region S2 . The wormhole W2 leads from the\nfuture to the past connecting the 'past side' of the region S2 with the 'future side' of the\nregion S1 .\nThe class P1 contains the paths that pass through the wormhole W2 once. The path\nof this type enters the mouth S2 of the wormhole at time t2 and go out of the mouth S1\nat time t1 . The scheme of these paths is following:\nP1 : initial point \u2192 S2 \u2192 W2 \u2192 final point.\nThe path of the class P2 proceeds through the wormhole W2 twice, going into S2 at\ntime t2 , going out of S1 at t1 , proceeding through the background spacetime again to time\nt2 , once more entering S2 , again going out of S1 , and ultimately approaching the final\npoint through the background spacetime. This corresponds to the following scheme:\nP2 : initial point \u2192 S2 \u2192 W2 \u2192 S2 \u2192 W2 \u2192 final point.\nGenerally, the paths of the class Pn with n \u2265 0 pass through the wormhole W2 precisely\nn times, according to the scheme\nPn : initial point ( \u2192 S2 \u2192 W2 )n \u2192 final point.\n12\n\n\fIt was argued in Introduction that the types of evolution corresponding to different numbers of returns of the particle to its past are usually (in \"normal conditions\")\nmacroscopically distinct and therefore cannot be coherently superposed. These types of\nevolution correspond to the paths belonging to different topological classes. If the decoherence takes place, the propagator defined by integrating over all paths (as in Eq. (2))\nmakes no sense. It seems reasonable to consider instead the propagators obtained by\nintegrating over the topological classes:\ni\nKn (t , x |t , x ) =\nS[x] .\nd[x] exp\nh\u0304\nPn\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n(9)\n\nThe operators corresponding to these two-point functions will be denoted by Kn :\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c8t\u2032\u2032 (x ) = (Kn (t , t ) \u03c8t\u2032 ) (x ) =\n\nZ\n\nKn (t\u2032\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 |t\u2032 , x\u2032 ) \u03c8t\u2032 (x\u2032 ) dx\u2032 .\n\nIf both the initial and final time moments t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 are in the same chronal region (before\nor after the time machine), then only one topologically trivial class n = 0 exists, and only\none operator K0 is defined by Eq. (9). It is evident that, according to general theory\n(Sect. 2), this operator K0 = U0 = U is the evolution operator of the particle in the\nchronal region. This operator is unitary.\nIf the time moments t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 are in different chronal regions or some of them (or both)\nare in the dischronal region, then there are operators Kn corresponding to arbitrary\nn = 00, 0, 1, 2, . . .. They seem to be good candidates for describing evolution in the nth\nsuperselection sector (nth classical alternative). We shall see that this is valid in the\ncase when the time t\u2032 is before the time machine emergence, t\u2032 < t1 and the time t\u2032\u2032\nis after it disappearing, t\u2032\u2032 > t2 . In this case the operators Kn = Un play the role of\n'partial evolution operators' satisfying the generalized unitarity condition,\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1.\n\nHowever when the time moment t\u2032\u2032 is in the dischronal region (within the time machine),\nthen the partial evolution operators Un will be shown to differ from the operators Kn by\ncertain projectors (see Sect. 5).\nThis is only natural because of the following.\n13\n\n\fThe coherency sectors for evolution of a particle in the time-machine spacetime may be\ndefined as a number of times the particle returns to its past. The set of such superselection\nsectors is in one-to-one correspondence with the topological classes Pn of paths between\nthe time t\u2032 < t1 and the time t\u2032\u2032 > t2 . Thus the above-defined operators Kn must coincide\nin the case t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 with what we call 'partial evolution operators' Un . However,\nif the final time t\u2032\u2032 of the evolution is within the time machine, t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 , the class Pn\nof paths leading to this time does not correspond to the nth coherency sector.\nIndeed, after the time moment t\u2032\u2032 the particle can either escape the time machine or\nenter the wormhole W2 and return to its past one or more times. Therefore, the operator\nKn (defined by summing up over the class Pn ) does not in fact coincide with the partial\nevolution operator for the nth alternative. If however we provide, multiplying Kn by the\ncorresponding projector, that the particle escape the time machine after t\u2032\u2032 , then we have\nthe correct partial evolution operator Un .\n\n4\n\nGeneralized Unitarity I\n\nWe considered in Sect. 2 the general situation when non-coherent sectors exist in the\nevolution of a quantum system. In Sect. 3 coherency sectors connected with topological\nclasses of paths were defined in the time-machine spacetime. In the present section and\nthe next one we shall formulate and prove the generalized unitarity condition for this case.\nAs has already been argued, the classical alternatives may be identified (at least for\nthe case t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 ) with the classes of paths Pn introduced in Sect. 3. Operators\nKn were defined in Sect. 3 by summation over classes Pn . It is natural to try and identify\nthese operators with the partial evolution operators Un corresponding to the alternatives.\nThis turns out to be correct for the most important case t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 (evolution\nfrom the past of the time machine to its future). This may be accepted also in the cases\nwhen both t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 are in the same chronal region. A more complicated situation arises if t\u2032\u2032\nis within the time machine (in the dischronal region). The corrections for this case will\n14\n\n\fbe introduced in the next section.\nConsider first the trivial situations of the evolution within one of two chronal regions.\nIn the case t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t1 (as well as for t2 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 ) there is only one (trivial) class of\npaths with n = 0 and only one operator K0 . This operator coincides in fact with the\nevolution operator in the background spacetime. Evolution in this case does not differ\nfrom usual coherent (unitary) evolution and is described by a single evolution operator\nU = U0 = K0 (we omit hereafter the explicit specification of the initial and final time\nmoments). The generalized unitarity condition coincides in this case with the conventional\nunitarity, U \u2020 U = 1.\nIf the evolution not restricted by a single chronal region is considered, all topological\nclasses n = 00, 0, 1, 2, . . . (and corresponding coherency sectors) exist. According to the\ngeneral formula (6), the generalized unitarity condition must then have the form\nU00 \u2020 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1\n\n(10)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere we omitted specification of the time interval. We shall see that this condition\nis actually fulfilled for the evolution operators Kn corresponding to the propagators (9)\nprovided the final time of the evolution, t\u2032\u2032 > t2 . This is why the operators Kn may\nactually be identified with the partial evolution operators Un in this case.\nThe generalized unitarity condition (10), as usual for quantum mechanics, expresses\nconservation of probability. If an initial state is described by the density matrix \u03c1, then\nthe probability of realization of nth alternative is, according to quantum theory of measurements (see Eq (7)),\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nPn = Tr\u03c1n = Tr Un \u03c1Un \u2020 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe condition (10) provides then that\nP00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPn = 1\n\nn=0\n\nfor an arbitrary initial state \u03c1. The same probability interpretation of the generalized\nunitarity is valid for all other choices of t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 that will be considered below.\n15\n\n\fTo demonstrate that the condition (10) is valid, we shall express the operators Kn in a\nmore explicit form, through the evolution operators in the background chronal spacetime\n(we shall denote them by Vi ) and the evolution operators in the wormholes (denote these\noperators Wi ). Besides this, two projectors in the background spacetime (Pi ) will be used\ndescribing entering the mouths of the wormholes. Expressions for the operators Kn may\nbe readily constructed with the help of the description of classes Pn (see Sect. 3).\nConsider first the case t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 , i.e. the evolution starting before the time\nmachine emergence and finishing after it disappearance.\nThe paths of the class P00 go from the starting point to the point at time moment t1 ,\nthen enter the wormhole W1 , proceed through it to the moment t2 and then go from t2 to\nthe final point. Summation over all paths of this type gives us the evolution operator K00\nin the form of the product V2 W1 P1 V1 where V1 and V2 are the evolution operators outside\nthe time machine (first of them between starting time t\u2032 and time t1 , and the second one\nbetween t2 and the final time t\u2032\u2032 ), and W1 is the evolution operator along the wormhole\nW1 . The projector P1 onto the region S1 provides entering the particle into the wormhole.\nAnalogously the expressions for all operators Kn can be found in the case t\u2032 < t1 <\nt2 < t\u2032\u2032 . We shall see below that these operators satisfy the generalized unitarity condition\nand may be identified with the partial evolution operators. This is why we shall denote\nthem by Un :\nU00 = K00 = V2 W1 P1 V1 ,\n\nUn = Kn = V2 (1 \u2212 P2)(V21 W2 P2 )n V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nn \u2265 0. (12)\n\nHere V21 is the evolution operator in the background spacetime between time moments\nt1 and t2 . The projector P2 provides entering the region S2 and therefore the wormhole W2 while the complementary projector 1 \u2212 P2 provides bypassing the wormhole W2 .\nAnalogously the projector 1 \u2212 P1 provides bypassing W1 .3\nNow we can easily prove the generalized unitarity (10) for the operators Un = Kn\ndefined by Eq. (12). In the proof we shall use unitarity of all Vi and Wi as well as the\n3\n\nWe denoted here the unity operator by 1 instead of 1.\n\n16\n\n\fproperties of projectors, Pi2 = Pi and Pi \u2020 = Pi . Let us present the expression Un \u2020 Un in\nthe form\n\u0010\n\nUn \u2020 Un = A\u2020 B \u2020\n\u0010\n\n= A\u2020 B \u2020\n\n\u0011n\n\nV21 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )V21 B n A\n\n\u0011n\u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nCB n\u22121 A \u2212 A\u2020 B \u2020\n\n\u0011n\n\nCB n A\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\nA = (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nB = W2 P2 V21 ,\n\nC = V21 \u2020 P2 V21 .\n\nSumming (13) in n, we shall obtain\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un = A\u2020 CA = V1 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P1 )V21 \u2020 P2 V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 .\n\n(14)\n\nn=1\n\nAdding two other terms U0 \u2020 U0 and U00 \u2020 U00 , we shall prove finally the generalized unitarity\ncondition (10).\nRemark 1 In the proof given above (and in the analogous proofs hereafter) it is supposed\nimplicitly that the terms of the sum (10) tend to zero when n tends to infinity. This is not\nvalid in the subspace of some 'finely tuned' states, and the formula (10) is not applicable\nin this subspace. More precisely, this formula, as an equality of two operators, is valid in\nthe space of states |\u03c8i for which\n\u0010\n\nlim h\u03c8|A\u2020 B \u2020\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0011n\n\nCB n A|\u03c8i = 0\n\n(in the notations introduced above). From the physical point of view, this means that\nthe probability for the particle (in the considered state) to return n times into its past\ninfinitely decreases when n tends to infinity. This is right for 'almost all' states. We shall\nsee in Sect. 8 however that this is not valid for some finely tuned states trapped within\nthe time machine.\nConsider now the case when the initial time moment t\u2032 is within the interval [t1 , t2 ],\nbut the final time t\u2032\u2032 is after t2 . In this case the paths cannot belong to the class P00 , thus\n17\n\n\fthe generalized unitarity takes the form\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1.\n\n(15)\n\nn=0\n\nLet us prove it.\nIn the case t1 < t\u2032 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 we have for the operators Kn (that again will prove to\ncoincide with the partial evolution operators Un ) the following formulas:\nUn = Kn = V2 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V20 ,\n\nn \u2265 0,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere V20 denotes the propagator in the background (chronal) spacetime from the initial\ntime t\u2032 (between t1 and t2 ) to the time t2 . Summing up the expression for Un \u2020 Un in the\nsame way as above gives the generalized unitarity in the form (15) provided we accept\nthe definition (16).\nLet now the final time t\u2032\u2032 of the evolution be between t1 and t2 . We shall see that the\n(generalized) unitarity does not take place for the operators Kn in this case, so that these\noperators cannot be identified with partial evolution operators. Right form of the partial\nevolution operators will be given in Sect. 5.\nConstructing the operators Kn in the same way as above (i.e. as integrals over the\ntopological classes of paths), we are led to the following formulas for the case t\u2032 < t1 <\nt\u2032\u2032 < t2 (when the initial time is earlier than the time machine emergence):\nKn = V01 (W2 P2 V21 )n (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nn\u22650\n\n(17)\n\n(V01 describes evolution between t1 and the final time t\u2032\u2032 ). If both initial and final times\nare within the time machine (t1 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 ), we have\nK0 = V0\u2032 0 ,\n\nKn = V0\u2032 1 W2 P2 (V21 W2 P2 )n\u22121 V20 ,\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\n(18)\n\nIn both cases (17), (18) the generalized unitarity does not take place.\nOne can readily see that the algebraic operations used earlier to prove the generalized\nunitarity, are now impossible because there is no projector of the form 1 \u2212 P2 in the\n18\n\n\fexpressions (17), (18). This gives a hint that the operator Un must differ from Kn by the\nfactor of the form 1 \u2212 Q2 where Q2 is a projector. We shall see in Sect. 5 that this may\nbe justified physically.\n\n5\n\nGeneralized Unitarity II\n\nIt has been shown in the preceding section that the operators Kn defined with the help\nof the classes of paths Pn and expressed by the formulas (17), (18) do not satisfy the generalized unitarity condition if the evolution is considered to the time moment t\u2032\u2032 between\nt1 and t2 .The physical reason of this is that the classes of paths do not correspond in this\ncase to the coherency sectors, i.e. to macroscopically distinguishable (distinct) physical\nsituations. Therefore, the operators Kn are not in this case partial evolution operators.\nIndeed, the situations are macroscopically distinct if they differ by the number of\nparticles in the time interval [t1 , t2 ]. If the path belongs to the class Pn and ends after\nt2 , it describes a quite definite number of particles, n + 1 (because returning to the past\nis impossible after time t2 ). However, if the path ends in the point t\u2032\u2032 < t2 , then the\nnumber of particles in the interval [t1 , t2 ] is indefinite, since it is not known whether the\nparticle will escape the time machine after t\u2032\u2032 or enter the back wormhole W2 , return to its\npast and propagate through the time machine once more. To fix the sector of coherency\n(classical alternative), we have to introduce projectors 1\u2212Q2 and Q2 corresponding to the\ntwo possibilities described above: escaping the time machine and entering it once more.\nIt is evident how this may be done. If the operator V20 describes the evolution between\nthe time moments t\u2032\u2032 (the final point of evolution) and t2 , then the operator\nQ2 = V20\u22121 P2 V20 = V20 \u2020 P2 V20\n\n(19)\n\nprojects on those states at time t\u2032\u2032 which after the evolution to the time t2 will enter the\nregion S2 and return to the past. Accordingly, the operator 1\u2212Q2 distinguishes the states\ncorresponding to the particle escaping from the time machine.\n19\n\n\fHaving the projector 1 \u2212 Q2 and using Eq. (17), one can find the partial evolution\noperators for the case t\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 :\nUn = (1 \u2212 Q2 )Kn = (1 \u2212 Q2 )V01 (W2 P2 V21 )n (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(20)\n\nLet us remark that, in a sense, these operators, not (17), correspond to the topological\nclasses of paths Pn . Indeed, they actually fix the number of times the particle returns to\nits past, not only before time t\u2032\u2032 , but also after this. The operators (20) provide that the\npaths from the only one class Pn contribute the evolution of the particle after t\u2032\u2032 as well\nas before this time.\nExpressing Q2 in (20) through P2 (due to (19)) and using the equation V21 = V20 V01\n(multiplicativity for V21 = V (t2 , t1 )), we have finally the following formula for the partial\nevolution operators in the case t\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 :\nUn = V20 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(21)\n\nLet us try to prove the generalized unitarity for these partial evolution operators. One\nmay for example substitute P2 in the formula (20) by its expression through Q2 to get\nUn = (1 \u2212 Q2 )V01 (W2 V20 Q2 V01 )n (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(22)\n\nThen, acting just as in Sect. 4, we have\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un = V1 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 .\n\n(23)\n\nn=0\n\nThe generalized unitarity is not yet fulfilled. The reason is that one more partial\nevolution operator must be considered, describing one more channel of evolution. Indeed,\nif the initial time is before t1 , then the particle have the possibility to enter the forwarddirected wormhole W1 . The probability of this alternative is to be taken into account.\nTo take it into account, we must interpret the concept of a 'final time moment' in\nanother way. So far we supposed that the 'final time' is nothing else than a space-like\nsurface (t\u2032\u2032 = const) in the background spacetime (the spacetime without wormholes).\n20\n\n\fHowever when the final time is within the time machine (i.e. later than t1 but earlier\nthan t2 ) this 'time' may be thought of as a sum of the space-like surface in the background\nspacetime plus a space-like slice of the wormhole W1 .\nWith this wider concept of the final moment, the particle may arrive at this moment\nnot only through the background spacetime but also through the wormhole W1 . The first\npossibility has been taken into account by the operators (22). The latter possibility is\ndescribed by the operator\nU00 = W01 P1 V1 .\n\n(24)\n\nAdding the term U00 \u2020 U00 to the sum (23) gives, in the case t\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 , the\ngeneralized unitarity condition in the form of Eq. (10).\nAt last, consider the case t1 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 when both initial t\u2032 and final t\u2032\u2032 time\nmoments are within the interval [t1 , t2 ]. Using the partial evolution operators obtained\nfrom (18) by inclusion the projectors 1 \u2212 Q2 = V20 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )V20 , we have\nUn = V20\u2032 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V20 ,\n\nn \u2265 0,\n\n(25)\n\nwe shall easily prove the generalized unitarity in this case too:\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1.\n\n(26)\n\nn=0\n\nOne more remark may be made in connection with the argument preceding Eq. (24).\nIf the concept of time moment within the time machine is changed (as was discussed in\nthe above-mentioned argument), the same wider concept must be applied not only to\n'final', but also to the 'initial time moment'. Then, besides the operators (25), one more\noperator should be added,\nU00 = W0\u2032 0\n\n(27)\n\ndescribing evolution in the wormhole W1 between two slices of this wormhole.\nIt seems at the first glance that this additional operator violates the (generalized)\nunitarity. One can see however that this is not the case. Indeed, by the unity operator 1\n21\n\n\fin Eq. (26), just as in all preceding formulas, we meant the unity operator in the space of\nstates localized on the space-like surface of the background spacetime. If we express this\nin the notation explicitly, Eq. (26) should read\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1background .\n\n(28)\n\nThe operator (27) satisfy the relation\nU00 \u2020 U00 = 1wormhole\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the r.h.s. is the unity operator for the states localized on the space-like slice of the\nwormhole W1 . Summing up both preceding formulas, one has the generalized unitarity\nin the form\nU00 \u2020 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1complete .\n\n(30)\n\nQuite analogously, the operator of the form\nU00 = V2 W20\n\n(31)\n\nmay be added to the series of operators (16). The remarks analogous to those of the\npreceding paragraph may be made in this case. The generalized unitarity takes then the\nform (30) (instead of (15)) for the case t1 < t\u2032 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 too.\nThus, the generalized unitarity takes place for an arbitrary time interval. Therefore,\nthe concept of probability may be used correctly even within the time machine.\nLet us make one more remark. We saw that an additional projecting factor 1 \u2212 Q2\nshould be including in the partial evolution operators Un corresponding to the final time\nwithin the time machine, t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 . The same logic seems to require inclusion of an\nanalogous factor 1 \u2212 Q1 in the expressions for Un in the case when the initial time is\nwithin the time machine, t1 < t\u2032 < t2 . This actually may be done. Then we guarantee\nthat the operators Un describe propagation of only those states that have resulted from\nthe evolution starting earlier than t1 . This however is not necessary because the operators\n22\n\n\fUn may be quite reasonably applied to arbitrary states prepared at time t\u2032 within the time\nmachine. This is why the projector 1 \u2212 Q1 turned out to be not necessary for providing\nthe generalized unitarity.\nPreparation of the state within the time machine could be restricted by the condition of\nself-consistency if interaction of the particle with its duplicates were taken into account.\nWe however consider non-interacting particles (i.e. we suppose that the interaction is\nnegligible). Therefore, the state of one particle at time t\u2032 within the time machine may be\nprepared arbitrarily.4 Further evolution of this arbitrary state will be described by one of\nthe partial evolution operators Un . Any number n may be realized in this evolution, the\nprobability of each of them being determined by the formula (11).\n\n6\n\nMultiplicativity for the Time Machine\n\nLet us address now the question of multiplicativity for the evolution in the time-machine\nspacetime. Multiplicativity of the propagators or evolution operators (3) means that the\nevolution during some time interval may be considered in two stages as evolution during\ntwo subintervals. With the decoherence caused by measurement, the multiplicativity is\ndescribed by the formula (8). We should now try and interpret this formula for the\nevolution in the time-machine spacetime with the specific decoherence (superselection)\narising in this case.\nThe winding number n introduced in Sect. 3 through the classes of paths Pn hints how\nmultiplicativity might be defined and proved in the case of the time machine. Indeed,\nthis number is equal to the number of times the particle returns to its past travelling\nthrough the wormhole W2 . If we have two alternatives characterized by the numbers n1\n4\n\nNotice that the complete description of the states of all particles at this moment (including the\n\noriginal particle and its duplicates) is not arbitrary. Indeed, if we are preparing, at time t\u2032 between\nmoments t1 and t2 , the state that will n times return to its past, then it is already known at t\u2032 that n\nduplicates of the particle exist coming from the region S1 at time t1 .\n\n23\n\n\fand n2 correspondingly, then the product of these alternatives corresponds to the number\nn = n1 + n2 . This means simply that if the particle returns n1 times and then once more\nreturns n2 times to its past, then ultimately it returns n1 + n2 times. It is evident that the\n(generalized) multiplicativity (8) might have, in the case of a time machine, the following\nform that can be readily proved for the operators Kn :\nK00 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) K00 (t\u2032 , t) = K00 (t\u2032\u2032 , t),\n\nKm (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) Kn (t\u2032 , t) = Km+n (t\u2032\u2032 , t),\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(32)\n\nThe relation (32) may be readily proved for the operators Kn with the help of the\npath-integral representation (9). The proof is based on the fact that each path p \u2208 Pm+n\nmay be presented as a product of the paths p1 \u2208 Pm and p2 \u2208 Pn , and vice versa, the\nproduct of any paths p1 \u2208 Pm , p2 \u2208 Pn gives a path belonging to Pm+n . By 'product' we\nmean passing through one of the paths and then through another one.The product of two\npaths is defined only if the first path ends in the point where the second one starts (see\n[18], Chapter 10 for details of this algebra of paths).\nInstead of this, the relation (32) for operators Kn may easily be proved by using\nexplicit expressions for these operators derived in Sect. 4. The latter way of consideration\nmay be applied also to the partial evolution operators Un which, as we know, do not\nalways coincide with the operators Kn . We shall see that for partial evolution operators\nUn the second of the relations (32) is valid only when at least one of the numbers m, n is\nzero.\nIt is evident that the generalized multiplicativity (32) is valid in the trivial cases\nt\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t1 and t2 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 , when it reduces to the conventional multiplicativity because\nboth m = n = 0:\nU0 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) U0 (t\u2032 , t) = U0 (t\u2032\u2032 , t).\nTrivial is also the case when one of the intervals [t, t\u2032 ] or [t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ] lies in one of the chronal\nregions. Then the multiplicativity takes one the following forms that can be easily proven:\nUn (t\u2032\u2032 , t) = U0 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) Un (t\u2032 , t) or Un (t\u2032\u2032 , t) = Un (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) U0 (t\u2032 , t).\n24\n\n\fConsider now non-trivial situations.\nSumming up the results of Sects. 4, 5, we have the following formulas for the partial\nevolution operators U00 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ), Un (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) (where n \u2265 0):\nt\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 :\nU00 = V2 W1 P1 V1 ,\n\nUn = V2 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 .\n\nt1 < t\u2032 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 :\nUn = V2 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V20 .\n\nU00 = V2 W20 ,\nt\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 :\nU00 = W01 P1 V1 ,\n\nUn = V20 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 .\n\nt1 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 :\nU00 = W0\u2032 0 ,\n\nUn = V20\u2032 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 P2 )n V20 .\n\nOne can verify straightforwardly that, of all multiplicativity relations (32), the following are valid also for the partial evolution operators:\nU00 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) U00 (t\u2032 , t) = U00 (t\u2032\u2032 , t),\n\nU0 (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) Un (t\u2032 , t) = Un (t\u2032\u2032 , t),\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(33)\n\nIf m 6= 0, the second of the relations (32) is not valid for Un . Moreover, if we defined\nthe partial evolution operators with the time argument within the time machine in such\na way as it was supposed in the remark at the end of Sect. 5, then even the products of\nthe form U0 Un with n 6= 0 would also give zero.\nWe see therefore that a topologically non-trivial evolution (described by the evolution\noperator Un with n \u2265 1) cannot be presented as the product of two topologically nontrivial evolutions. Topologically non-trivial evolution is 'integral in time', it cannot be\nfollowed step by step: first m 6= 0 returns to the past, then again n 6= 0 returns that\nfinally gives m + n returns.\nThis is not astonishing. If we describe the evolution within the time machine, not\nachieving an exit from it, then this part of evolution cannot be characterized by a definite\n25\n\n\fnumber n of returns of the particle to the past (this number depends on the subsequent\nstage of evolution). In a sense, evolution within the time machine is not local in time,\ninfluence of the future cannot be excluded.\nWe succeeded in constructing operators describing evolution to the time moment t\u2032\u2032\nwithin the time machine, for example Un (in,past). However a special projector in this\noperator provides escaping from the time machine after time t\u2032\u2032 . This operator guarantees\nthat the future stage of evolution (after t\u2032\u2032 ) will not influence the past evolution (until t\u2032\u2032 ).\nThus, non-locality of evolution within the time machine is evident even from the structure\nof partial evolution operators, not only from the form of multiplicativity for them.\nOn the other side, the operators Kn (but not Un ) possess the property of multiplicativity (32) for arbitrary time arguments.\nOne may object that expressing multiplicativity in terms of the operators Kn , in\nfact non-physical within the time machine, makes no sense (if the superselection in n\ntakes place). In fact, each of these operators describes propagation of non-physical states\n(forbidden superpositions). However, the product of such operators,\nKnN (t\u2032\u2032 , \u03c4N \u22121 ) . . . Kn2 (\u03c42 , \u03c41 )Kn1 (\u03c41 , t\u2032 ) = Kn1 +n2 +...+nN (t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ),\nwith t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 , is a correct partial evolution operator. No non-physical state is\npropagated due to this operator. Thus, even though each of the operators Kn describes\npropagation of non-physical states within the time machine, the result of the propagation\nfrom the past (in respect to the time machine) to the future of the time machine is\npresented by these operators correctly.\nOne may say that the operators Kn give multiplicative description of evolution even\nwithin the time machine, but at the price of introducing non-physical states in intermediate stages.\nOne more interpretation of the results obtained is complementarity between (generalized) unitarity and multiplicativity. One may describe the evolution within the time\nmachine by the operators Un (unitary in the generalized sense but satisfying only trivial\n26\n\n\fmultiplicativity relations) or by Kn (satisfying the generalized multiplicativity but not\nunitarity).\n\n7\n\nComparison with the Unitary Theory\n\nWe showed in Sects. 4, 5 that the description of the particle evolution in the time-machine\nspacetime with the help of the partial propagators (partial evolution operators) is correct\nfrom the point of view of probabilities. This statement means that the partial evolution\noperators Un satisfy the condition of generalized unitarity (10).\nIn the conventional theory, when no decoherence (superselection) is supposed, the\nevolution is described by a single evolution operator U which must be unitary, U \u2020 U = 1.\nIn a number of papers evolution of particles in a time-machine spacetime was described\nin this way (see [11] and references therein). Let us compare two types of theories. This\nis not difficult because we used here the same model of spacetime as in [11].\nIt was shown in [11] that a single evolution operator U = U(t\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032 ) is unitary in the\ncase t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 when the evolution from the past of the time machine to its future\nis considered. At the first glance, this contradicts to our conclusion about generalized\nunitarity of the partial evolution operators Un in this case.\nIndeed, the evolution operator U was defined in [11] by summation over all paths. In\nour terms, this means that this operator is equal to\nU = U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(34)\n\nUn\n\nn=0\n\nwhere Un are defined by Eq. (12). Unitarity for this operator means that\nU00 \u2020 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nU00 \u2020 Un +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 U00 +\n\nn=0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUm \u2020 Un = 1.\n\n(35)\n\nm,n=0\n\nThe formulas (10) and (35) differ by the non-diagonal terms (they are absent in the former\ncase). Both formulas may be valid only if a sum of non-diagonal terms is zero. It turns\nout however that this actually takes place in the considered case (t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 ), so\n27\n\n\fthat both forms of unitarity turn out to be valid. Let us show this with the evolution\noperators (12).\nConsider an off-diagonal term in (35), Un+k \u2020 Un , k \u2265 1. Using Eq. (12), one may\npresent this term in the form\nUn+k \u2020 Un = A\u2020 (B \u2020 )n+k\u22121 CB n\u22121 A \u2212 A\u2020 (B \u2020 )n+k CB n A\n\n(36)\n\nwhere it is denoted\nA = (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 ,\n\nB = W2 P2 V21 ,\n\nC = V21 \u2020 P2 V21 .\n\nThe formula (36) is valid for all n \u2265 1. Summing up this expression in n from 1 to \u221e\nand adding the terms Uk\u22121 \u2020 U00 and Uk \u2020 U0 , we have\nUk\u22121 \u2020 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn+k \u2020 Un\n\nn=0\n\u2020\n\n= V1 (1 \u2212 P1 )(V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020 )k\u22121V21 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )W1 P1 V1\n+ V1 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P1 )(V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020 )k V21 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1\n+ V1 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P1 )(V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020 )k V21 \u2020 P2 V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1\nTwo last terms here can be summed up to give a more simple expression:\n\u2020\n\nUk\u22121 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn+k \u2020 Un\n\nn=0\n\u2020\n\n= V1 (1 \u2212 P1 )(V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020 )k\u22121 V21 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P2 )W1 P1 V1\n+ V1 \u2020 (1 \u2212 P1 )(V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020 )k (1 \u2212 P1 )V1\n\n(37)\n\nIn the r.h.s. of the latter expression however both terms are equal to zero. The reason\nis the following equations:\n(1 \u2212 P2 )W1 = 0,\n\n(1 \u2212 P1 )W2 = 0.\n\n(38)\n\nThe first of them is a consequence of the fact that after propagation in the wormhole\nW1 the particle is in the space region S2 . The operator P2 projects on this region, and\n28\n\n\f1 \u2212 P2 projects on the complementary region (all the space-like surface t2 = const of\nthe background spacetime excluding the region S2 ). Going out of the wormhole W1 the\nparticle cannot be in this complementary region. Therefore, the first equation in (38) is\nvalid. Analogously, the second equation in (38) follows from the fact that after travelling\nin the wormhole W2 the particle turns out to be in the space region S1 , and projecting,\nby 1 \u2212 P1 , on the complementary region gives zero.\nUsing the first equation from (38) and a conjugate to the second equation we see that\nthe expression (37) as well as its conjugate are equal to zero. Therefore,\nUk\u22121 \u2020 U00 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn+k \u2020 Un = U00 \u2020 Uk\u22121 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un+k = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nThus, the off-diagonal terms do not contribute the sum (35), and both unitarity and\ngeneralized unitarity are valid in the considered case: evolution from the initial chronal\nregion (earlier than the time machine) to the final chronal region (after it).\nThis does not mean of course that both descriptions, one with the superselection and\none without superselection, are equivalent. According to the coherent description, the\nevolution law is following:\n\u03c1\u2032 = U \u03c1 U \u2020 = U00 \u03c1 U00 \u2020 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nU00 \u03c1 Un \u2020 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u03c1 U00 \u2020 +\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUm \u03c1 Un \u2020 .\n\nm,n=0\n\nAccording to the theory with decoherence (superselection), the evolution should be described by partial evolution operators according to a general formula (5) that takes the\nfollowing form in our case:\n\u03c1\u2032 = U00 \u03c1 U00 \u2020 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nUn \u03c1 Un \u2020 .\n\n(40)\n\nn=0\n\nThis leads of course to different predictions. Thus, the two theories have different physical\ncontents.5\n5\n\nLet us repeat once more that decoherence of different n leading to generalized unitarity must take\n\nplace \"in ordinary conditions\" while coherent description may be valid \"in special conditions\" when the\nenvironment does not distinguish between different numbers of particles in the dischronal region.\n\n29\n\n\fConsider different locations of times t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 (the start and the end of the evolution)\nin respect to the time machine. In all cases when at least one of the time moments t\u2032 ,\nt\u2032\u2032 is within the time machine, no unitarity is found in the paper [11]. However, using\nthe definition (20), we can prove Eq. (39) in just the same way as above for the case\nt\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 . Thus, in this case operator (34) is also unitary. There is again no\ncontradiction with the result of [11] because in that paper not this operator, but\n\nP\n\nn\n\nKn\n\nwas considered as an evolution operator (both definitions coincide for t\u2032 < t1 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 ).\nFormally unitarity for t\u2032 < t1 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 is caused by the projector 1 \u2212 Q2 in the\ndefinition of Un . Physically the reason of this is that this projector provides escaping the\nparticle from the time machine (see Sect. 5). Thus, though we deal with t\u2032\u2032 < t2 , actually\nthe situation is, in a sense, equivalent to the case t\u2032\u2032 > t2 .\nFor the cases t1 < t\u2032 < t2 < t\u2032\u2032 and t1 < t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032 < t2 the relation U \u2020 U = 1 is invalid,\nand we are left only with the generalized unitarity. We could introduce in these cases\ntoo a sort of projector providing unitarity of the operator\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn . However there is no\n\nphysical ground for this (see the remark at the end of Sect. 5).\n\n8\n\nStates Trapped in the Time Machine\n\nWe considered the evolution of a particle entering the time machine from the past chronal\nregion, circulating several times within the time machine and then escaping from it into\nthe future chronal region. There are however the states that exist only within the time\nmachine but not in the chronal regions. These states may be described at arbitrary time\nmoment between t1 and t2 . We shall describe them at time t1 .\nConsider the state |\u03c81 i at time t1 possessing the properties\n(1 \u2212 P2 )V21 |\u03c81 i = 0,\n\n(1 \u2212 W2 V21 )|\u03c81 i = 0\n\nIt is evident that the particle in this state \"bites its own tail\": after evolution to t2 it\nenters the wormhole W2 and after going out of the wormhole it turns out to be in the\n30\n\n\fstate identical with the initial state. After this the same cycle of evolution is repeated.\nThe particle in such a state travels through the interval [t1 , t2 ], but it never passes any\ntime moment before t1 or any time moment after t2 .\nThere is evident generalization of this state, providing passing the dischronal region\ntwice, three times or generally n times before reaching the initial state. Such a state\nsatisfies the following conditions at time t1 :\n\u2032\n\n(1 \u2212 P2 ) (V21 W2 )n V21 |\u03c8n i = 0 for n\u2032 < n,\n(1 \u2212 (W2 V21 )n )|\u03c8n i = 0.\n\n(41)\n\nThen the particle \"bites its own tail\" after winding n causal loops: after n cycles, each\nof which contains travelling through the interval [t1 , t2 ], entering the wormhole W2 and\npassing this wormhole, the state is identical to the initial one.\nThe states thus described are nothing else than a quantum version of the classical \"Jinnee\" discussed in [19, 20], the classical bodies moving along closed time-like trajectories\nwithin a time machine.\nOne can construct a state in such a way as to provide passing the dischronal region\ninfinite number of times never escaping to the future, but with the initial state never\nbeing repeated. The condition for this is (at time t1 )\n\u2032\n\n(1 \u2212 P2 ) (V21 W2 )n V21 |\u03c8\u221e i = 0 (all n\u2032 ).\n\n(42)\n\nThe particle in such a state cannot go out of the time machine though probably its state\nnever becomes identical to the initial state. The states (41) may be considered to be\nspecial cases of (42).\nOne more generalization can be considered: the state existing earlier than the time\nmachine emerged (before t1 ) but trapped in TM so that it cannot be found at times later\nthan t2 . Let us characterize this state at time t\u2032 < t1 :\nP1 V1 |\u03c8n i = 0 (the particle does not enter W1 ),\n\u2032\n\n(1 \u2212 P2 )(V21 W2 )n V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 |\u03c8n i = 0,\n31\n\nn\u2032 \u2265 1 (it does not escape TM).\n\n\fIt may be shown that the state of the particle in this case cannot be repeated after a\nfinite number n of cycles. The condition for such a repetition,\n(1 \u2212 (V21 W2 )n )V21 (1 \u2212 P1 )V1 |\u03c8n i = 0 (the state is repeated after n cycles).\nwould be inconsistent due to the relation W2 = P1 W2 (expressing that the mouth leading\nout from the wormhole W1 is in the region S1 ).\nTherefore, it is possible that a particle enters the time machine from the past and\nstays within it, infinitely repeating evolution from t1 to t2 and backward. Moreover, the\nstates obtained by time reversal from those already considered, may also be defined. Then\nthe particle escapes from the time machine into the future after infinite number of cycles\nwithin the time machine, never being in the past chronal region.\nExistence of the states trapped in the time machine contradicts to the generalized\nunitarity condition in the form given earlier. Indeed, this condition provides that any\nstate evolves finally to the future chronal region through one of the channels enumerated\nby n. The trapped states do not at all escape from the time machine. These states belong\nto the class of 'finely tuned' states which the generalized unitarity condition is not valid\nfor (see Remark 1 at page 17).\nFor example, application of the (generalized) unitarity condition (26) for evolution\nfrom the time t1 (considered as a time within the time machine) to the same time t1\nshould seemingly forbid the trapped states. However, analysing attentively the proof of\nthis condition, we see that it is supposed in this proof that the operator\nIN = 1 \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0010\n\nUn \u2020 Un = V21 \u2020 P2 W2 \u2020\n\nn=0\n\n\u0011N\n\nV21 \u2020 P2 V21 (W2 P2 V21 )N\n\ntends to zero when N \u2192 \u221e. The expectation value of this operator for almost all states\n(as well as the trace of this operator multiplied by almost all density matrices) decreases\nwith increasing N. However, for the states considered in the present section (the trapped\nstates) we have, as a consequence of Eq. (42),\nh\u03c8| 1 \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nUn \u2020 Un |\u03c8i = h\u03c8|\u03c8i = 1.\n\nn=0\n\n32\n\n\fHence the operator IN does not decrease and the generalized unitarity condition is not\nfulfilled in the space of the trapped states.\nThe physical interpretation of this fact in terms of probabilities is following. For\nthis very special class of states (not escaping to the future chronal region) no part of\nprobability goes into channels enumerated by n. It might be reasonable to introduce one\nmore channel corresponding to n = \u221e and claim that all probability, for these states,\ngoes into this channel. This leads to the following remark.\nRemark 2 In a general case (for arbitrary states) the generalized unitarity condition\nshould be written in the form\nN\nX\n\nU00 \u2020 U00 +\n\nUn \u2020 Un + IN = 1\n\nn=0\n\n(where the operator IN is given above for the case t\u2032 = t\u2032\u2032 = t1 and can be readily written\nfor all other choices of t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032 ). The expectation value of this formula for an arbitrary\nstate |\u03c8i,\nh\u03c8|U00 \u2020 U00 |\u03c8i +\n\nN\nX\n\nh\u03c8|Un \u2020 Un |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|IN |\u03c8i = 1,\n\nn=0\n\ngives the probability distribution for different channels of evolution (the last term in the\nl.h.s. gives the probability for all channels with numbers more than N). If the limit\nh\u03c8|I\u221e |\u03c8i = lim h\u03c8|IN |\u03c8i\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nexists, the formula\nh\u03c8|U00 \u2020 U00 |\u03c8i +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\u03c8|Un \u2020 Un |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|I\u221e |\u03c8i = 1\n\nn=0\n\ngives the probability distribution for all channels with finite n and for the channel with\nn = \u221e corresponding to the trapped states.\n\n33\n\n\f9\n\nConclusion\n\nWe considered in this paper how evolution of a non-relativistic non-interacting quantum\nparticle in the spacetime with closed time-like curves (a time-machine spacetime) should\nbe described. A simple non-relativistic model of such a spacetime was used corresponding\nto emergence of the time machine at some time moment and its disappearance at another\nmoment.\nIn the paper [11] evolution of a particle in this spacetime was described with the\nhelp of the evolution operator U found by path integration. It was shown that such an\noperator is multiplicative and unitary only when the evolution is considered between the\ntime moments belonging to the chronal regions (including the case when one of the time\nmoments is in the past chronal region and the other is in the future chronal region).\nIn our paper the arguments were given that superselection (decoherence) may arise\nfor the evolution in this spacetime (in \"normal conditions\"). The superselection sectors\nare enumerated in this case by the number of times the particle returns to its past.\nTherefore, evolution of the particle is described by a family of partial evolution operators\nUn (or partial propagators) instead of a single evolution operator U.\nIn the case when the evolution is considered into the future chronal region (i.e. to\nthe time moment after the time machine disappearance), the partial propagators may be\ncorrectly defined as integrals over the corresponding topological classes of paths. If the\nfinal time of evolution is within the time machine, the path-integral expressions for the\npartial propagators (evolution operators) should be corrected by the projectors providing\nescaping the particle from the time machine after a certain number of returns to the past.\nWith these definitions, the family of partial evolution operators satisfy the generalized\nunitarity condition\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn \u2020 Un = 1 and multiplicativity condition Un Um = Un+m (the\n\nlatter is fulfilled only for at least one of the numbers n, m equal to zero). It is shown that\nthe generalized unitarity is compatible with the unitarity of the operator U =\n\nP\n\nn\n\nUn in\n\nthe case of evolution from the past of the time machine to its future. Nevertheless, the\n34\n\n\foperator U cannot describe correctly the evolution if the superselection exists.\nA special class of states of the particle is described emerging and disappearing simultaneously with the time machine, i.e. existing only within it. These states present a\nquantum analogue of the classical \"Jinnee\" states investigated earlier [19, 20]. Besides\nthis, the states are considered that either 1) exist in the past of the time machine but then\nare trapped in it and never escape into the future of the time machine, or 2) never exist in\nthe past of the time machine, have infinite number of cycles within the time machine and\nthen finally escape into its future. For all these states the generalized unitarity condition\nshould be corrected to take into account the channel of evolution with n = \u221e.\nFrom conceptual point of view, the superselection of the considered type may be\nthought of as the influence of the future on the past, i.e. a sort of \"consistency conditions\".\nThe coherent (unitary) evolution in the time-machine spacetime is also possible, but\nonly in quite special conditions when the environment of the particle in the dischronal\nregion does not distinguish between different numbers of particles.6 It is interesting that\nin the case of coherent evolution no information from the future to the past can be carried\nby the particle. If the particle leaves some information about the future in its past, then\nthe interaction responsible for the information transfer leads to decoherence so that the\nwinding number n becomes definite.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOne of the authors (M.M.) is grateful to J.
