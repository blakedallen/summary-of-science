Introduction\nCritical phenomena in spin systems and elsewhere are usually described in terms of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking or of singular behavior of the partition function. On the\nother hand, the size of domains of parallel spins generally increases near criticality, and so\nthe search for a geometric \"connectivity\" formulation has been a long standing challenge.\nFor some classes of systems, the problem is solved, and I begin by recalling how this is\ndone.\nThe Ising model is defined by the Hamiltonian\nH(T, H) = \u2212J\n\nX\n\nsi sj \u2212 H\n\nX\n\nsi ;\n\nsi = \u00b11\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b2 \u2261 1/T ;\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\n<ij>\n\nwhich is used to calculate the partition function\nZ(T, H) =\n\nX\n\nexp{\u2212\u03b2H(T, H)};\n\n{si }\n\nhere J denotes the nearest neighbor spin-spin coupling and H an external field. Given\nZ(T, H), the magnetization and (isothermal) susceptibility are obtained as\nm(T, H) = (\u2202 log Z/\u2202H)T ,\n1\n\n\u03c7(T, H) = (\u2202m/\u2202H)T .\n\n(3)\n\nPlenary talk given at the Europhysics Conference on Computational Physics, Aachen/Germany, Sept.\n5 - 8, 2001.\n\n\fFor vanishing external field, H = 0, the Ising model leads to a critical point T = Tc :\nfor T < Tc , the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian H(T, 0) is spontaneously broken by the\nstate of the system. The magnetization becomes the order parameter for the transition\nand vanishes for T \u2192 Tc , while the susceptibility diverges there:\nm(T, 0) \u223c (Tc \u2212 T )\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03c7(T, 0) \u223c |Tc \u2212 T |\u03b3 .\n\nT \u2264 Tc ;\n\n(4)\n\nThe critical exponents \u03b2 and \u03b3 specify the critical behavior and define the universality\nclass of the transition.\nIt was shown by Fortuin and Kasteleyn [1] that the partition function of the model,\ngiven in Eq. (2) as sum over spin configurations, can for H = 0 be equivalently written\nas a sum over configurations of clusters containing n lattice points. In the resulting form\nZ(T, 0) =\n\nX\nn\n\nnij =1\n\n{\n\nY\n\nnij =0\n\npb\n\n<ij>\n\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 pb ) 2c(n) },\n\n(5)\n\n<ij>\n\npb \u2261 1 \u2212 exp{\u22122\u03b2J} defines a bond weight between adjacent sites, while nij = 1(0)\nspecifies whether two sites are bonded or not. The number of n-clusters is given by c(n).\nIn percolation theory, the observable corresponding to the order parameter is the\npercolation strength P (T ), defined as the probability that a given site belongs to a percolating cluster. In place of the susceptibility we now have the average cluster size S(T );\nin the percolation region only finite clusters are included in the averaging. Using the FK\nformalism, Coniglio and Klein [2] showed that the percolation point coincides with the\nthermal critical temperature Tc , and that the percolation behavior is governed there by\nP (T ) \u223c (Tc \u2212 T )\u03b2 , T \u2264 Tc ;\n\nS(T ) \u223c |Tc \u2212 T |\u03b3 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b3 are the usual thermal Ising exponents. For the Ising model, thermal critical\nbehavior can thus be equivalently described as percolation of FK clusters.\nA non-vanishing external field, H 6= 0, explicitly breaks the previous Z2 symmetry\nof the Hamiltonian, and as a result, partition function and thermodynamic observables\nbecome analytic: there is no more thermal critical behavior. The magnetization now\nnever vanishes; H aligns some spins at any temperature (see Fig. 1).\nHowever, the percolation transition persists also for H 6= 0. For any value of H\nthere exists a percolation point Tp (H), such that for T \u2264 Tp there is percolation and for\nT > Tp not [3]. The critical behavior along the \"Kert\u00e9sz line\" Tp (H) (see Fig. 1) is now\ndetermined by percolation critical exponents, so that the transition is no longer in the\nIsing universality class.\nWe note here that the equivalence between thermal and percolation behavior can in\nfact be restored if clusters are not required to be spatially connected. The introduction of\nan H-dependent ghost spin not on the lattice but able to couple to any lattice site allows\nspatially disjoint sites to form a cluster [6] and thus leads to percolation for all H 6= 0.\nWe are here interested in the relation between spatial connectivity and thermal behavior;\ntherefore we shall not pursue the ghost spin approach any further.\nOne major reason for our study is to address critical behavior in finite temperature\nQCD; let us therefore elaborate a little the problems which arise there. The constituents\nof strongly interacting matter, the hadrons, are finite size color-neutral bound states of\n2\n\n\foo\n\nm(T)\n1\n\nTb\nH\npercolating\n\nTp (H)\nH=0\n\nTp (H)\n\nH=0\n\nnon-percolating\n\nT\n\nT\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\noo\n\nTc\n\noo\n\nFigure 1: Magnetization and Kert\u00e9sz line in the Ising model.\ntwo (mesons) or three (nucleons) colored quarks coupled by colored gluons. At high density, when the hadrons strongly overlap, each quark finds in its immediate vicinity many\nothers, so that a partitioning into subsets of two or three quarks in a given volume no\nlonger makes any sense, suggesting that we now have quark matter. High temperatures\nlead through particle-antiparticle production to high density. Hence we expect at sufficiently high temperatures a transition from hadronic matter, with color-neutral hadrons\nas constituents, to a plasma of unbound colored quarks and gluons. One of the basic\nissues of strong interaction thermodynamics is this quark-hadron transition.\nThe theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is defined by the\nQCD Lagrangian L(mq ), which contains the bare quark mass as an open parameter. In\nQCD thermodynamics, two limits are of particular interest. For massless quarks, mq = 0,\nL(0) is invariant under chiral transformations. This chiral symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken for T < T\u03c7 : through a surrounding gluon cloud, the quarks acquire a dynamically generated 'constituent quark' mass Mq , which essentially determines the mass of the\nconventional hadrons. Thus the mass of a nucleon as three quark bound state is approximately 3Mq . At T = T\u03c7 , chiral symmetry is restored, Mq \u2192 0 and hadrons dissolve into\nquarks and gluons. In the opposite limit, for mq \u2192 \u221e, the quarks drop out and QCD\nbecomes a (non-Abelian) SU(3) gauge theory, which describes a system of interacting\ngluons. At low temperatures, these bind to form 'glueballs' as the hadrons of the theory.\nThe resulting Lagrangian has a global Z3 symmetry. For some T \u2265 Tc , this symmetry is\nspontaneously broken; color screening causes the colorless glueballs to dissolve into colored gluons, corresponding to the onset of color deconfinement. QCD thus leads to two\ngenuine phase transitions:\n\u2022 for mq = 0, chiral symmetry restoration at T\u03c7 , corresponding to the vanishing of\nthe constituent quark mass;\n\u2022 for mq = \u221e, spontaneous Z3 breaking at Tc corresponding to the onset of color\ndeconfinement in pure gauge theory.\nIn the real world, mq is small but finite; what happens then? For three massless quark\nflavors, the Z3 transition is first order, so a discontinuity will persist for some range of\nmasses mend\n< mq . For mq < mend\nq\nq , there is no further thermal critical behavior, which\nmeans that there is no true phase transition separating hadronic matter and quark-gluon\n3\n\n\fplasma (see Fig. 2). Is the transition from one state to the other then just a rapid crossover? We would like to speculate that it is the Kert\u00e9sz line of QCD, corresponding to the\nonset of percolation for clusters of deconfined matter [7], and we have carried out some\npreliminary studies to address this idea.\nTc\n\noo\n\noo\n\nmq\n\nH\n\nTp (H)\nT p(mq )\n\nT c(Ho )\nT\n\n0\n0\n\nT\u03c7\n\nTdis(H)\n\n0\n0\n\noo\n\nTc\n\nT\noo\n\nFigure 2: The phase structure of QCD (left) and of the 3-d 3-state Potts model (right)\n2. Percolation and Deconfinement\nAs a simplified model, we consider here pure SU(2) gauge theory, which describes a\nsystem of interacting gluons of three different colors. Given such a medium at temperature T , we denote by V (r, T ) the potential between two static color charges Q and Q\u0304\nseparated by a distance r. Below a certain critical temperature Tc , there is confinement:\nthe potential rises linearly with distance, so that V (r, T ) \u2192 \u221e for r \u2192 \u221e. Above Tc ,\ncolor screening limits the range of the potential, so that now V (r, T ) \u2192 g(T ) for r \u2192 \u221e,\nwith a finite g(T ) > 0. The Polyakov loop expectation value, defined by\nL(T ) = lim exp{\u2212V (r, T )/T },\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(7)\n\nthus vanishes for T \u2264 Tc , i.e., in the confinement region, and takes on a non-zero value\nfor T > Tc , when deconfinement set in. Hence it is the deconfinement order parameter.\nIn the lattice formulation of finite temperature QCD, one studies systems in the usual\nthree space dimensions, with one additional dimension specifying the temperature. A\nPolyakov loop becomes in lattice SU(2) an up or down spin of arbitrary amplitude, associated to a given spatial lattice site and oriented in the temperature direction; the\nexpectation value L(T ) is the average over all spatial lattice sites. Polyakov loop configurations on a given spatial lattice thus form something like a continuous spin Ising model,\nand it was therefore conjectured that the deconfinement transition in SU(2) gauge theory\nis in the universality class of the Ising model [4]. This conjecture was subsequently confirmed by extensive lattice studies, showing that the critical exponents of the two models\nagree with remarkable precision [5].\nWe now would like to check if the deconfinement transition can also be described as\npercolation of like-sign Polyakov loop clusters. The first question to be addressed is the\ngeneralization of the global FK bond weight 1 \u2212 exp{\u22122J/T } of the conventional Ising\nmodel with si = \u00b11 to the case where the amplitude of the spin becomes a local variable.\n4\n\n\fIt was shown in both analytic and numerical studies of the continuous spin Ising model\n[10] that percolation and the thermal transition in fact become equivalent if the bond\nweights are taken to have the local form 1 \u2212 exp{\u2212(2J/T )si sj } for adjacent like-sign\nspins.\nTurning to SU(2) gauge theory, we therefore start with the local FK bond weight\np(i, j) = 1\u2212exp{2\u03baLi Lj } expressed in terms of the local values Li , Lj of like-sign Polyakov\nloops on adjacent spatial lattice sites i, j; the variable \u03ba must take into account the temperature dependent Polyakov loop coupling. The generalization to SU(2) thus leads to\ntwo basic problems: how can one determine the functional form of \u03ba(T ), and is it justified\nto approximate the correlations provided by the theory to only nearest neighbor interactions? In the strong coupling limit [11], one finds for N\u03c4 = 2 that \u03ba(T ) \u2243 (\u03b2(T )/2)2,\nwhere \u03b2(T ) is the known temperature dependent coupling in the SU(2) gauge theory action. Using this relation, we thus generate SU(2) configurations at different temperatures\nand study the clustering properties. The results [8] show overall agreement, but some\ndiscrepancies in details; in particular, the critical couplings for the thermal transition and\nfor deconfinement are obtained with very high precision and disagree slightly.\nIt therefore seems worthwhile to consider a formulation in which the strong coupling\napproximation and the restriction to nearest neighbor interactions are removed. This can\nbe done in an effective spin description, in which the thermal system is parametrized in\na spin model allowing longer range interactions as well, with up to 20 different couplings\nbetween different spins [9]. The values of these couplings are then determined numerically\nnear the thermal critical point which in turn provides generalized bond weights \u03ban ,\np(i, i + 1) = 1 \u2212 exp{\u22122\u03ba1 Li Li+1 }, p(i, i + 2) = 1 \u2212 exp{\u22122\u03ba1 Li Li+2 }, ...\n\n(8)\n\nThe resulting agreement between the critical thermal and percolation parameters is excellent, as seen in Table 1. The approach used here does not solve the question of how\nto define in general the FK bond weights in terms of the SU(2) Lagrangian; but it does\nshow that the equivalence between thermal and geometric descriptions can be established\nnumerically.\n\nPercolation\nSpontaneous Z2 Breaking\nIsing Model [12]\n\nCritical point\n1.8747(2)\n1.8735(4)\n\n\u03b2/\u03bd\n0.528(15)\n0.523(12)\n0.518(7)\n\n\u03b3/\u03bd\n1.985(13)\n1.953(18)\n1.970(11)\n\n\u03bd\n0.632(11)\n0.630(14)\n0.6289(8)\n\nTable 1: Parameters for percolation and spontaneous Z2 breaking in 3+1 SU(2).\nWe therefore conclude that color deconfinement in SU(2) gauge theory can be considered either as spontaneous Z2 symmetry breaking or as the onset of Polyakov loop\npercolation. Both phenomena occur at the same critical temperature Tc and are described\nin terms of the same set of critical exponents.\n3. Percolation in Non-Critical Thermal Systems\nWe would like to formulate a percolation description of deconfinement in full QCD with\ndynamical quarks; again we start with a preliminary study and consider spin systems with\n5\n\n\fa non-vanishing external field H 6= 0. The basic issue here is to generalize the FK bond\nweights to include a dependence on H: pb (T, H). This problem is not yet solved; we shall\naddress two closely related questions.\nConsider the 2-d Ising model with H 6= 0; the behavior of the magnetization was\nshown in Fig. 1. Included there is the Kert\u00e9sz line Tp (H), separating the percolating\n(T \u2264 Tp (H)) and the non-percolating region (T > Tp (H)). In addition, one can also\nconsider the pseudocritical line T\u03c7 (H), defined by the temperature value for which the\nisothermal susceptibility \u03c7T \u2261 (\u2202m/\u2202H)T peaks for a given H; for H = 0, it would\ndiverge at Tc .\nWe want to compare these two temperature lines [13]; in all percolation calculations,\nwe use the conventional (H-independent) FK bond weights introduced in section 1. In\nterms of the reduced variables t \u2261 (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc and h \u2261 H/J we find for small h\nt\u03c7 = c1 h1/\u03b2\u03b4\n\nand tp = c2 hx ,\n\n(9)\n\nfor the pseudocritical Ising line and the Kert\u00e9sz line, respectively, with constants c1 and\nc2 . For the Ising model, one has the exact result 1/\u03b2\u03b4 = 8/15 \u2243 0.533, while a numerical\nstudy of percolation gives x = 0.534(3). For small h, the two lines thus have the same\nh-dependence. However, c1 6= c2 , so that the lines do not coincide. For large h, this\nis obvious: tp (h) \u2192 tb for h \u2192 \u221e, where tb is the bond percolation temperature, but\nt\u03c7 \u2192 \u221e for h \u2192 \u221e, although the susceptibility peak becomes arbitrarily weak in this\nlimit. This illustrates the necessity to obtain field-dependent bond weights pb (T, H) for a\nreasonable description at H 6= 0. We note here that a comparison with the pseudocritical\nbehavior of the isothermal susceptibility is not a unique way to specify p(T, H), since\nother susceptibilities or the correlation length lead to slightly shifted peak temperatures.\nIn a second study [14], we consider the 3-d 3-state Potts model, which shows a first\norder phase transition for H = 0. When an external field is turned on, the discontinuity\nin e.g. the magnetization decreases but continues for 0 \u2264 H < H0 , defining a line Tdis (H).\nThis ends for some value H = H0 at Tc (H0 ) with a second order phase transition which\nappears to be in the universality class of the Ising model [15]. For H > H0 , the partition\nfunction is analytic and there is no more thermal critical behavior (see Fig. 2). Using the\nconventional FK bond weights p(T ) = 1 \u2212 exp{\u22122J/T }, we now study the percolation\nbehavior of the model. The result is\n\u2022 for 0 \u2264 H < H0 , there is a discontinuous onset of percolation at the same Tdis (H)\nat which there is discontinuous thermal behavior;\n\u2022 at H = H0 , the percolation and the thermal transition become continuous and occur\nat the same temperature Tc (H0 ). In contrast to the Ising-like thermal behavior,\nthe percolation transition leads to exponents which are neither in the Ising nor in\nthe random percolation universality class. This is presumably due to the infinite\ncorrelations at Tc (H0 ), similar to what is found for pure site percolation in the 2-d\nIsing model at the Curie point [16].\nThus again there seems to exist a definite relation between percolation and thermal critical\nbehavior, but with the conventional FK weight, there is not real equivalence; a bond\nweight p(T, H) seems to be needed. Here, however, in contrast to the pseudocritical\nline(s), the problem is well-defined: what p(T, H) will put percolation at Tc (H0 ) into\nthe Ising universality class? This is quite similar to the original question of what p(T )\n6\n\n\fwould change random percolation enough to map the new clustering pattern onto thermal\ncritical behavior, solved by the FK bond weights. If a correct p(T, H) can be determined,\none would have full equivalence between percolation and thermal critical behavior both\nin the first order region and for the continuous transition at the endpoint; beyond that,\npercolation only would persist. Given such a framework, one could then try to address\nthe similar structure in full QCD (Fig. 2).\n4. Outlook\nFrom what we have seen, thermal critical behavior can in many cases be formulated as\ncluster percolation. The interesting feature is, however, that percolation can persist even\nwhen thermal critical behavior stops, such as in spin systems with external field. Here the\npercolation strength P (T ) and the cluster size S(T ) remain singular when the partition\nfunction Z(T ) becomes analytic. This raises some intriguing questions. Can one give\na more general definition of critical behavior, such that percolation is included? What\nphysical features distinguish the percolating from the non-percolating phase [17]? Is it\npossible to define a more 'detailed' partition function Z(T, x) at some fixed connectivity\nmeasure x, which results in the usual Z(T ) after summation or integration over all x? It\nseems that all these points could eventually provide a new opening to thermodynamics.\nAcknowledgements\nMost of the recent results reported on here are based on joint work with Santo Fortunato; it is a great pleasure to thank him for this fruitful collaboration.
