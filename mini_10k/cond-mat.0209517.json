The building blocks are mere electrons,\nprotons and neutrons, their collective behavior has been shown to lead to a\nvariety of astonishing phenomena. Classic examples of such quantum correlated systems are superconductivity [1], superfluidity [2] and the fractional\nquantum Hall effect (FQHE) [3]. In these instances, the departure from\nusual behavior is often symptomatic of the presence of a non trivial ground\nstate: a ground state which cannot be described by a systematic application\nof perturbation theory on the noninteracting system.\nInvestigations on such ground states naturally lead to that of the elementary excitations of the system. One typically probes the system with\nan external interaction which triggers the population of excited states. The\nsubsequent measurement of the thermodynamical properties then provides\nsome crucial information. From a different angle, transport measurements\ndeal with open systems connected to reservoirs. There are several ways\nto approach the issue of (quasi)-particle correlations using transport experiments. One can chose to study a system where interactions are most\nexplicit, such as the FQHE, otherwise, to look for statistical interactions in\nFermi and Bose systems. Noise being a multi-particle diagnosis, it can be\nemployed to study both issues.\n\n\f2\n\nT. MARTIN AND A. CREPIEUX AND N. CHTCHELKATCHEV\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to describe two situations where positive\nnoise correlations can be directly monitored using a transport experiment,\neither with a superconductor or with a correlated electron system. To be\nmore precise, the present text reflects the presentations made by the three\nauthors during the Delft NATO workshop. Bell inequalities and quantum\nmechanical non-locality with electrons injected from a superconductor will\nbe addressed first [4]. Next, noise correlations will be computed in a carbon\nnanotube where electrons are injected in the bulk from a STM tip [5]. The\nfirst topic is the result of an ongoing collaboration with G. Lesovik and\nG. Blatter over the years. The unifying theme is that in both branched\nquantum circuits, entanglement is explicit and can be illustrated via noise\ncorrelations. Entanglement can be achieved either for pairs of electrons\nin the case of superconductor sources connected to Fermi liquid leads, or\nalternatively for pairs of quasiparticle excitations of the correlated electron\nfluid.\nA normal metal fork attached to a superconductor can exhibit positive\ncorrelations [6, 7], which had been attributed primarily to photonic systems\nin the seminal Hanbury-Brown and Twiss experiment [8]. They arise when\nthe source of particles is a superconductor [6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] or they also\noccur in systems with floating voltage probes [14]. Here, evanescent Cooper\npairs can be emitted on the normal side, due to the proximity effect [15].\nThese Cooper pairs can either decay in one given lead, which gives a negative contribution to noise correlations, or may split at the junction on the\nnormal side with its two constituent electrons propagating in different leads.\nThis latter effect constitutes a justification for positive noise correlations.\nIf filters, such as quantum dots, are added to the leads, such a mechanism\ngenerates delocalized, entangled electron pairs [7, 16]. In order to exit from\nthe superconductor, a Cooper pair has to be split between the two normal leads. This provides a solid state analog of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\n(EPR) states which were proposed to demonstrate the non-local nature of\nquantum mechanics [17]. Photon entanglement has triggered the proposition of new information processing schemes based on quantum mechanics\nfor quantum cryptography or for teleportation [18]. Concrete proposals for\nquantum information prossessing devices based on electron transport and\nelectron interactions in condensed matter have been recently presented.\n[7, 16, 19, 20]. Here we will analyze whether a non-locality test can be\nconceived for electrons propagating in quantum wave guides. It is indeed\npossible to perform the exact analog of a Bell inequalities violation [21] for\nphotons in a condensed matter system [4].\nAs cited above, positive correlation do not necessarily require a superconducting source of electrons. A particular geometry using a one dimensional correlated electron liquid can be studied for the same purposes. In\n\n\fNOISE CORRELATIONS AND BELL\n\n3\n\nparticular, it allows to probe directly the underlying charges of the collective excitations in the Luttinger liquid. In order to make contact with\nexperiments, the setup consists of a nanotube whose bulk is contacted by an\nSTM tip which injects electrons by tunneling, while both extremities of the\nnanotube collect the current. The current, the noise and the noise correlations are computed, and the effective charges are determined by comparison\nwith the Schottky formula. For an \"infinite\" nanotube, the striking result\nis that noise correlations contribute to second order in the electron tunneling, in sharp contrast with a fermionic system which requires fourth order.\nThe noise correlations are then positive, because the tunneling electron\nwave function is split in two counter propagating modes of the collective\nexcitations in the nanotube.\nThe transport properties of quasiparticles will be addressed from first\nprinciples. The understanding of interactions \u2013 statistical or otherwise \u2013 in\nnoise correlations experiments will be approached here from the point of\nview of scattering theory and of the Keldysh technique [22].\n2. Hanbury\u2013Brown and Twiss correlations\nParticularly interesting is the role of electronic correlations in quantum\ntransport. Correlations can have several causes. First, they may originate\nfrom the interactions between the particles themselves. Second, correlations\nare generated by a measurement which involves two or more particles. In\nthe latter case, non-classical correlations may occur solely because of the\nbosonic or fermionic statistics of particles, with or without interactions.\nThe measurement of noise \u2013 the Fourier transform of the current\u2013current\ncorrelation function \u2013 constitutes a two particle measurement, as implied\nin the average of the two current operators:\n1\nS\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9 = 0) =\n2\n\nZ\n\ndt (hI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b2 (0) + I\u03b2 (0)I\u03b1 (t)i \u2212 2hI\u03b1 ihI\u03b2 i) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere I\u03b1 is the current operator in reservoir \u03b1, and the time arguments on\nthe average currents have been dropped, assuming a stationary regime.\nConsider the case of photons propagating in vacuum: the archetype of\na weakly interacting boson system. It was shown [8] that when a photon\nbeam is extracted from a thermal source such as a mercury arc lamp, the\nintensity correlations measured in two separated photo-multipliers are always positive. On average, each photon scattering state emanating from\nthe source can be populated by several photons at a time \u2013 due to the\nbunching property of bosons. As a result when a photon is detected in one\nof the photo-multipliers, it is likely to be correlated with another detection in the other photo-tube. The positive correlations can be considered\n\n\f4\n\nT. MARTIN AND A. CREPIEUX AND N. CHTCHELKATCHEV\n\nas a diagnosis of the statistics of the carriers performed with a quantum\ntransport experiment.\n2.1. NOISE CORRELATIONS IN NORMAL METALS\n\nWhat should be the equivalent test for electrons ? A beam of electrons can\nbe viewed as a train of wave packets, each of which is populated at most by\ntwo electrons with opposite spins. If the beam is fully occupied, negative\ncorrelations are expected because the measurement of an electron in one\ndetector is accompanied by the absence of a detection in the other one, as\ndepicted in Fig. 1a. It was understood recently [23] that if the electrons\npropagate in a quantum wire with few lateral modes, maximal occupancy\ncould be reached, and the anti-correlation signal would then be substantial.\nConsider the device drawn in Fig. 1a : electrons emanating from reservoir 3 have a probability amplitude s1(2)3 to end up in reservoir 1(2). For\nsimplicity we assume that each lead is connected to a single electron channel. The scattering matrix describing this multi-terminal system is hermitian because of current conservation. On general grounds, it is possible to\nderive the following sum rule for the autocorrelation noise and the noise\ncorrelations [24]:\nX\n\nS\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9 = 0) +\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\nS\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9 = 0) = 0 .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\nNote that this sum rule only holds for normal conductors, but it not valid\nfor conductors which involve superconducting reservoirs. The scattering\ntheory of electron transport [22] then specifies how to compute the current\nand the noise correlations between the two branches. The current in lead\n\u03b1 is given by\ne\nhI\u03b1 i =\nh\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb\n\ndE \uf8edTr[1\u03b1 \u2212 s\u2020\u03b1\u03b1 s\u03b1\u03b1 ]f\u03b1 (E) \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\n\uf8f6\n\ns\u2020\u03b1\u03b2 s\u03b1\u03b2 f\u03b2 (E)\uf8f8\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwith s\u03b1\u03b2 the amplitude to go from reservoir \u03b2 to reservoir \u03b1, 1\u03b1 is the\nidentity matrix for lead \u03b1, and f\u03b1 the associated Fermi function.

Yet there exist situations\nwhere they can be positive in a fermionic system.\n2.2. FORK GEOMETRY WITH A SUPERCONDUCTOR SOURCE\n\nIf the reservoir which injects electrons in the fork is a superconductor as\nin Fig. 1b, both positive and negative noise correlations are possible [6].\nCharge transfer between the injector and the two collectors 1 and 2 is then\nspecified by the Andreev scattering process, where an electron is reflected\nas a hole. Positive correlations are linked to the proximity effect, as superconducting correlations (Cooper pairs) leak in the two normal leads.\nDepending on the nature of the junction in Fig. 1b, it may be more favorable for a pair to be distributed among the two arms than for a pair to enter\na lead as a whole.

The junction is composed of four distinct regions (see\ninset Fig. 2).

Next, 3 is connected to two reservoirs 1 and 2 by a beam splitter which is parameterized\nby a single parameter 0 < \u01eb < 1/2 identical to that of Ref. [28]: the splitter\nis symmetric, its scattering matrix coefficients are real, and transmission\nbetween 3 and the reservoirs is maximal when \u01eb = 1/2, and vanishes at\n\u01eb = 0.\nPerforming the energy integrals in Eq.

(a) Without filters, entangled pairs of quasi-particles (Cooper\npairs) injected in N3 propagate into leads N1 or N2 either as a whole or one by one. The\nferromagnetic filters in setup (b) separates the entangled spins, while the energy filters\nin (c) separate electron- and hole quasi-particles.\n\ncreased, multiple Andreev processes start taking some importance. Further\nreducing the beam splitter transmission allows to balance the contribution of split Cooper pairs with that of Cooper pairs entering the leads as\na whole. Note that inclusion of disorder or/and additional leads has been\ndiscussed by many authors, using either the scattering approach [9, 12, 13]\nor circuit theory [10] to treat the diffusive limit. To summarize, both positive and negative noise correlations are possible there, and such results are\ndiscussed in detail in the contributions of [29] and [30] contained in this\nvolume. In particular, the possibility for positive noise cross-correlation is\nreduced for asymmetric multichannel conductors. Although sample specific,\nthe scattering theory results of Refs. [6, 13] are found to be rather robust\nin the presence of disorder.\n2.3. FILTERING SPIN/ENERGY\n\nApplying spin or energy filters to the normal arms 1 and 2 (Fig. 3), it is\npossible to generate positive correlations only [7]. For electron emanating\nfrom a superconductors, it is possible to project either the spin or the\nenergy with an appropriate filter, without perturbing the entanglement of\nthe remaining degree of freedom (energy or spin). Energy filters, which are\nmore appropriate towards a comparison with photon experiments, will have\nresonant energies symmetric above and below the superconductor chemical\n\n\fNOISE CORRELATIONS AND BELL\n\n9\n\npotential which serve to select electrons (holes) in leads 1(2). The positive\ncorrelation signal then reads:\nZ\ne2 X e|V |\nd\u03b5T\u03b6A (\u03b5)[1 \u2212 T\u03b6A (\u03b5)] ,\nS12 (0) =\nh \u03b6 0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the index \u03b6 = h, \u03c3, 2, (\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193) identifies the incoming hole state for\nenergy filters (positive energy electrons with arbitrary spin are injected in\nlead 1 here). \u03b6 = h, \u2191, 1 (h, \u2193, 2) applies for spin filters (spin up electrons\n\u2013 with positive energy \u2013 emerging from the superconductor are selected in\nlead 1). T\u03b6A is then the corresponding (reverse) crossed-Andreev reflection\nprobability [31] for each type of setup: the energy (spin) degree of freedom\nis frozen, while the spin (energy) degree of freedom is unspecified. eV < 0\ninsures that the constituent electrons of a Cooper pair from the superconductor are emitted into the leads without suffering from the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple. Moreover, because of such filters, the propagation of a Cooper\npair as a whole in a given lead is prohibited. Note the similarity with the\nquantum noise suppression mentioned above. This is no accident: by adding\nconstraints to our system, it has become a two terminal device, such that\nthe noise correlations between the two arms are identical to the noise in\none arm:\nS11 (\u03c9 = 0) = S12 (\u03c9 = 0) .\n(11)\nThe positive correlation and the perfect locking between the auto and cross\ncorrelations provide a serious symptom of entanglement. One can speculate (however without a rigorous proof yet) that the wave function which\ndescribes the two electron state in the case of spin filters reads:\n|\u03a6spin\n\u03b5,\u03c3 i = \u03b1|\u03b5, \u03c3; \u2212\u03b5, \u2212\u03c3i + \u03b2| \u2212 \u03b5, \u03c3; \u03b5, \u2212\u03c3i ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the first (second) argument in |\u03c61 ; \u03c62 i refers to the quasi-particle\nstate in lead 1 (2) evaluated behind the filters, \u03b5 is the energy and \u03c3 is a\nspin index. The coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be tuned by external parameters,\ne.g., a magnetic field. Note that by projecting the spin degrees of freedom\nin each lead, the spin entanglement is destroyed, but energy degrees of\nfreedom are still entangled, and can help provide a measurement of quantum\nmechanical non locality nevertheless. A measurement of energy \u03b5 in lead\n1 (with a quantum dot) projects the wave function so that the energy \u2212\u03b5\nhas to occur in lead 2. On the other hand, energy filters do preserve spin\nentanglement, and are appropriate to make a Bell test (see below). In this\ncase the two electron wavefunction takes the form:\n|\u03a6energy\ni = \u03b1|\u03b5, \u03c3; \u2212\u03b5, \u2212\u03c3i + \u03b2|\u03b5, \u2212\u03c3; \u2212\u03b5, \u03c3i .\n\u03b5,\u03c3\n\n(13)\n\n\f10\n\nT.

TUNNELING APPROACH TO ENTANGLEMENT\n\nWe recall a perturbative argument which supports the claim that two electrons originating from the same Cooper pair are entangled. Consider a\nsystem composed of two quantum dots (energies E1,2 ) next to a superconductor. An energy diagram is depicted in Fig. 4. The electron states\nin the superconductor are specified by the BCS wave function |\u03a8BCS i =\nQ\n\u2020 \u2020\nk (uk + vk ck\u2191 c\u2212k\u2193 )|0i. Tunneling to the dots is described by a single electron hopping Hamiltonian:\nHT =\n\nX\n\n[t1k c\u20201\u03c3 + t2k c\u20202\u03c3 ]ck\u03c3 + h.c. ,\n\n(14)\n\nk\u03c3\n\nwith c\u2020k\u03c3 creates an electron with spin \u03c3.

The state of Eq. (15)\nhas entangled spin degrees of freedom. This is clearly a result of the spin\nsymmetry of the tunneling Hamiltonian. Given the nature of the correlated\nelectron state in the superconductor in terms of Cooper pairs, HT can only\nproduce singlet states in the dots.\n3. Bell inequalities with electrons\nIn photon experiments, entanglement is identified by a violation of Bell\ninequalities (BI) \u2013 which are obtained with a hidden variable theory. But\nin the case of photons, the BIs have been tested using photo-detectors\nmeasuring coincidence rates [32]. Counting quasi-particles one-by-one in\ncoincidence measurements is difficult to achieve in solid-state systems where\nstationary currents and noise are the natural observables [26]. Here, the\nBIs are re-formulated in terms of current-current cross-correlators (noise\ncorrelations) [4].\nIn order to derive Bell inequalities, we consider that a source provides\ntwo streams of particles (labeled 1 and 2) as in Fig. 5a injecting quasiparticles into two arms labelled by indices 1 and 2.

The chemical potential of\nthe superconductor is larger than that of the leads, which means that electrons are flowing out of the superconductor. Two normal leads 1 and 2\nare attached to it in a fork geometry [7, 16] and the filters Fe1,2 enforce\nthe energy splitting of the injected pairs. Fd1,2 -filters play the role of spinselective beam-splitters in the detector.

For a biased superconductor with\ngrounded normal leads, we find in the tunneling limit the noise\nS\u03b1\u03b2 = e sin\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8\u03b1\u03b2\n2\n\n\u0013Z\n\n|eV |\n\nd\u03b5T A (\u03b5) ,\n\n(27)\n\n0\n\nwhich integral also represents the current in a given lead (we have dropped\nthe subscript in T A (\u03b5) assuming the two channels are symmetric). Here \u03b1 =\n3, 5, \u03b2 = 4, 6 or vice versa; \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 denotes the angle between the magnetization\nof leads \u03b1 and \u03b2, e.g., cos(\u03b856 ) = a * b, and cos(\u03b854 ) = a * (\u2212b). Below, we\n\n\f14\n\nT. MARTIN AND A. CREPIEUX AND N. CHTCHELKATCHEV\n\nneed configurations with different settings a and b and we define the angle\n\u03b8ab \u2261 \u03b856 . V is the bias of the superconductor.\nThe \u039b-terms in Eq. (26) can be dropped if hI\u03b1 i\u03c4 \u226a 1, \u03b1 = 3, . . . , 6,\nwhich corresponds to the assumption that only one Cooper pair is present\non average. The resulting BIs Eqs. (24)-(26) then neither depend on \u03c4 nor\non the average current but only on the shot-noise, and F = \u2212 cos(\u03b8ab ); the\nleft hand side of Eq. (24) has a maximum when \u03b8ab = \u03b8a\u2032 b = \u03b8a\u2032 b\u2032 = \u03c0/4\nand \u03b8ab\u2032 = 3\u03b8ab . With this choice of angles the BI Eq.(24) is violated, thus\npointing to the nonlocal correlations between electrons in the leads 1,2 [see\nFig. 5(b)].\nIf the filters have a width \u0393 the current is of order eT A \u0393/h and the\ncondition for neglecting the reducible correlators becomes \u03c4 \u226a h\u0304/\u0393T A . On\nthe other hand, in order to insure that no electron exchange between 1 and\n2 one requires \u03c4 \u226a \u03c4tr /T A (\u03c4tr is the time of flight from detector 1 to 2).\nThe conditions for BI violation require very small currents, because of the\nspecification that one entangled pair at a time is in the system. Yet it is\nnecessary to probe noise cross correlations of these same small currents. The\nnoise experiments which we propose here are closely related to coincidence\nmeasurements in quantum optics. [32]\nIf we allow the filters to have a finite line width, which could reach\nthe energy splitting of the pair, the violation of BI can still occur, although\nviolation is not maximal. Moreover, when the source of electron is a normal\nsource, it is possible to show that in \"standard device geometries\", where\nsingle electron physics is at play, Bell inequalities are not violated: in this\nsituation the term \u039b\u00b1 dominates over the noise correlation contribution.\nNevertheless, it would be possible in practice to violate Bell inequalities if\nthe normal source itself, composed of quantum dots as suggested in Ref.\n[34, 35], could generate entangled electron states as the result of electronelectron interactions.\nNote that there are other inequalities which test entanglement for particles sources with the number of terminals two and larger than (see, e.g., Ref.\n[33]); tests of such inequalities can be implemented in a similar manner as\ndiscussed above. For example, one can use Clauser-Horne (CH) inequalities\n[36] (instead of Bell Inequalities) to test the entanglement in the solid-state\nsystems shown in the Fig. 5. The derivation of CH-inequality is similar to\nthat of BI; it is based on the lemma: if x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 , X, Y are real numbers\nsuch that x, x\u2032 \u2208 [0, X] and y, y \u2032 \u2208 [0, Y ]. The following inequality then\nholds:\n\u2212XY \u2264 xy \u2212 xy \u2032 + x\u2032 y + x\u2032 y \u2032 \u2212 Y x\u2032 \u2212 Xy \u2264 0 .\n(28)\n\nThe definitions for x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 are the same as in Eqs.(20) and (21), but\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nX = hN5 (t, \u03c4 )i\u03bb , Y = hN6 (t, \u03c4 )i\u03bb , where hN6 (t, \u03c4 )i\u03bb is the number\nof particles coming into the arm of the detector \u03b1 = 5, 6 when it doesn't\n\n\fNOISE CORRELATIONS AND BELL\n\n15\n\ninclude the spin-filter[36, 37]. Finally we get the CH-inequality in a similar\nmanner as the Bell inequality, with the same assumption of small times:\nS56 (a, b) \u2212 S56 (a, b\u2032 ) + S56 (a\u2032 , b) + S56 (a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) \u2212 S56 (a\u2032 , \u2212) \u2212 S56 (\u2212, b) \u2264 0 ,\n(29)\nwhere S56 (a\u2032 , \u2212) is the shot noise when there is no spin-filter on the way\nof the particles coming from the source into the the detector arm 6. In\nthe tunneling limit S56 (a\u2032 , b)/S56 (a\u2032 , \u2212) = sin2 (\u03b856 /2) and Eq. (20) gives\nS56 . CH-inequalities are maximally violated when \u03b8a,b = \u03b8a\u2032 ,b\u2032 = \u03c0/2,\n\u03b8a,b\u2032 = \u03c0/4, and \u03b8a\u2032 ,b = 3\u03c0/4 [this choice of\u221aangles is different than in BI\ncase]; then the left-hand side of Eq. (29) is ( 2 \u2212 1)/2.\nCH-inequalities have one working advantage compared to BIs: Eq. (29)\nincludes only correlations between terminals 5 and 6, the number of correlators in Eq. (29) is decreased compared to the BI's. Moreover, in the case\nof CH the spin-filters of the detector can include only one ferromagnet in\neach arm rather than two as in Fig. 5b.\n4. Electron injection in the bulk of a nanotube\nSo far, noise was computed for non\u2013interacting systems. If one puts aside\nthe fact that electrons are converted into holes the calculation of noise in\nNS systems is similar to the normal case. Recall now the classic results for\nthe FQHE. The long wave length edge excitations along a quantum Hall\nbar can be described by a Luttinger liquid [38]. Backscattering can be induced by bringing together two counter\u2013propagating edges using a point\ncontact. In the absence of impurities or backscattering, the maximal edge\ncurrent is IM = \u03bde2 /h, while for weak backscattering, the current voltage\ncharacteristic is highly non linear for Laughlin fractions, i.e. hIB i \u223c V 2\u03bd\u22121\n(hIB i is the average backscattering current and V is the voltage bias between the two edges). A two terminal noise measurement performed on a\ngated mesoscopic device in this regime provides a direct link to the quasiparticle charge. Quasiparticles are scattered from one edge to the other one\nby one, so the usual Schottky formula SB = 2e\u2217 hIB i which relates the zero\nfrequency backscattering noise to the average current flowing between the\ntwo edges applies [39], with an effective carrier charge e\u2217 = \u03bde contains\nthe electron filling factor [40, 41, 42]. This fractional charge was measured\nrecently by several groups [43, 44]. Statistical interaction between quasiparticle have been addressed theoretically [45] in an Hanbury-Brown and\nTwiss geometry.\nAttention is now turning towards conductors which are essentially free of\ndefects and which have one\u2013dimensional character. Carbon nanotubes can\nhave metallic behavior, with two propagating modes at the Fermi level, and\nconstitute good candidates to study Luttinger liquid behavior. In particu-\n\n\f16\n\nT.

Schematic configuration of the nanotube\u2013STM device: electrons are injected\nfrom the tip at x = 0: current is measured at both nanotube ends, which are set to the\nground\n\nlar, their tunnel density of states \u2013 and thus their I(V ) characteristics \u2013 is\nknown to have a power law behavior [46, 47, 48].\nNanotube Luttinger liquids are non-chiral in nature, so a straightforward transposition of the results obtained for chiral edge systems is not obvious. Nevertheless, non\u2013chiral Luttinger liquids also have underlying chiral\nfields [49, 50]. Such chiral fields correspond to excitations with anomalous\n(non-integer) charge, which has eluded detection so far.\nThe transport geometry (Fig. 6) implies: tunneling from the tip (normal\nor ferromagnetic metal) to the nanotube, and subsequent propagation of\ncollective excitations along the nanotube. In the absence of tunneling, the\nHamiltonian is thus simply the sum of the nanotube Hamiltonian, described\nby a two mode Luttinger liquid, together with the tip Hamiltonian. Using\nthe standard conventions [51], the operator describing an electron with\nspin \u03c3 moving along the direction r, from mode \u03b1 is specified in terms of a\nbosonic field:\n\u221a P\n1\ni\u03b1k x+irqF x+i \u03c02\nh\n(\u03c6j\u03b4 (x,t)+r\u03b8j\u03b4 (x,t))\nj\u03b4 \u03b1\u03c3j\u03b4\ne F\n,\n(30)\n\u03a8r\u03b1\u03c3 (x, t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0a\nwith a a short distance cutoff, kF the Fermi momentum, qF the momentum\nmismatch associated with the two modes, and the convention r = \u00b1, \u03b1 = \u00b1\nand \u03c3 = \u00b1 are chosen for the direction of propagation, for the nanotube\nbranch, and for the spin orientation. The non-chiral Luttinger liquid bosonic\nfields \u03b8j\u03b4 and \u03c6j\u03b4 , with j\u03b4 \u2208 {c+, c\u2212, s+, s\u2212} identifying the charge/spin\nand total/relative fields, have been introduced. The coefficients are defined\nas h\u03b1\u03c3c+ = 1, h\u03b1\u03c3c\u2212 = \u03b1, h\u03b1\u03c3s+ = \u03c3 et h\u03b1\u03c3s\u2212 = \u03b1\u03c3.

For\nthe sake of generality, we allow the two spin components of the tip fields\nto have different Fermi velocities u\u03c3F , which allows to treat the case of a\nferromagnetic metal. The fermion operator at the tip location x = 0 is then:\n1\nei\u03c6\u0303\u03c3 (t) .\nc\u03c3 (t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0a\n\n(32)\n\nHere, \u03c6\u0303\u03c3 is the chiral Luttinger liquid field, whose Keldysh Green's function\n(here at x = 0) is given in [52].\nThe tunneling Hamiltonian is a standard hopping term:\nHT (t) =\n\nX\n\n\u0393(\u03b5) (t)[\u03a8\u2020r\u03b1\u03c3 (0, t)c\u03c3 (t)](\u03b5) .\n\n(33)\n\n\u03b5r\u03b1\u03c3\n\nHere the superscript (\u03b5) leaves either the operators in bracket unchanged\n(\u03b5 = +), or transforms them into\u2013 their hermitian conjugate (\u03b5 = \u2212).\nThe voltage bias between the tip and the nanotube is included using the\nPeierls substitution: the hopping amplitude \u0393(\u03b5) acquires a time dependent\nphase exp(i\u03b5\u03c90 t), with the bias voltage identified as V = h\u0304\u03c90 /e. We use\nthe convention h\u0304 \u2192 1.

The contribution of the nanotube fields and of the tip are regrouped\ninto two time ordered products. Each can be related to an correlator of\nseveral exponentiated bosonic fields.

Here the noise correlations have the added particularity\nthat they occur to second order in a perturbative tunneling calculation.\nStrictly positive noise correlations are known to occur in superconductingnormal systems with filters, with applications toward entanglement [7, 19,\n53]. As noted before, positive correlations do not constitute a rigorous proof\nfor entanglement. In the present case, one single electron is injected, but\n\n\f20\n\nT. MARTIN AND A. CREPIEUX AND N.

Consequently, quantum mechanical non-locality is quite explicit here.\nThis entanglement is the direct consequence of the correlated state of the\nLuttinger liquid: the addition of an electron does not yield an eigenstate\nof the Luttinger liquid Hamiltonian. Electrons must be decomposed into\nspecific modes, which happen to propagate in opposite directions. It differs\nsignificantly from its analogs which use superconductors [7, 13, 16, 19, 53].\n\n\fNOISE CORRELATIONS AND BELL\n\n21\n\nWhen considering for instance the total charge sector j\u03b4 = c+, the wave\nfunction is similar to a triplet spin state (a symmetric combination of \"up\"\nand \"down\" states, or \"plus\" and \"minus\" charges) for electrons, with the\nelectrons being replaced by chiral quasiparticle operators. Yet, each chiral\nfield \u03c6\u0303rj\u03b4 can be written as a linear superposition of boson creation and\nannihilation operators, and these bosonic fields appear in an exponential.\nThis expresses entanglement between \"many\u2013boson\" states.\nWe mention briefly the effect of one-dimensional Fermi liquid contacts.\nThey can be included as in Ref. [54] by connecting both nanotube ends\nL = 1. Standard results\nto Luttinger liquids with interaction parameters Kj\u03b4\nproper to Fermi liquid systems are then recovered. To a first approximation,\nthe Luttinger liquid parameters of the nanotube disappear from transport\nquantities (current or noise) when such quantities are evaluated in the leads.\nHowever, higher order corrections in the voltage still carry a dependence\nN . The charge noise follows a Schottky formula S = ehI i, and the\non Kj\u03b4\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nnoise correlations to order \u03932 vanish \u2013 for fermions, the leading order being\nin \u03934 .\n6. Conclusion\nHanbury\u2013Brown and Twiss geometries provide a physical test of mesoscopic\ntransport. They can be used to check the bosonic/fermionic statistics of the\ncarriers, or alternatively to generate entangled streams of particles. Information about statistics is necessarily contained in quantum measurements\nwhich involve two particles or more: here the zero frequency noise correlations play the role of the intensity correlator in the early quantum optics\nexperiment of Ref. [8].\nA general form of BI-tests in solid-state systems has been proposed,\nwhich is formulated in terms of current-current cross-correlators (noise correlations), the natural observables in the stationary transport regime of a\nsolid state device. For a superconducting source injecting correlated pairs\ninto a normal-metal fork completed with appropriate filters [7, 16], the analysis of such BIs shows that this device is a source of entangled electrons\nwith opposite spins when the fork is weakly coupled to a superconductor.\nThe possibility of a Bell test for this superconductor-normal \"fork\" devices puts electronic entanglement in condensed matter systems on a firm\nfooting. It is now appropriate to imagine practical information processing\ndevices which exploit this entanglement, in a similar manner as in quantum\noptics. In particular, a proposal for electron teleportation consisting of 5\nquantum dots (2 superconducting dots and 3 normal dots) together with a\nsuperconducting circuit was presented at the workshop. The spin state of\nan electron can be transfered to another dot without direct matter transfer,\n\n\f22\n\nT. MARTIN AND A. CREPIEUX AND N. CHTCHELKATCHEV\n\nand the teleportation sequence is selected with the electrostatic interactions\nbetween the dots. Details of this proposal are presented elsewhere [55].\nA diagnosis for detecting the chiral excitations of a Luttinger liquid\nnanotube has been presented, which is based on the knowledge of low frequency current fluctuation spectrum in the nanotube. Typical transport\ncalculations either address the propagation in a nanotube, or compute tunneling I(V) characteristics. Here, both is necessary to obtain the quasiparticle charges. Also, both the noise autocorrelation and the noise crosscorrelations are needed to identify the charges Q\u00b1 .\nGranted, this relies on the assumption that one dimensional Fermi liquid\nleads are avoided. Multiple scattering at the contacts [56] may allow to\npreserve the contribution of the noise cross-correlations to second order\nin the tunneling amplitude. In particular, special circumstances such as\nembedded contacts [13], transport quantities seem not be renormalized by\nthe contact parameters. This type of geometry could in fact be tested to\nanalyze the type of contacts which one has between the nanotube and\nits connections. If the ratio S\u03c1 (x, \u2212x, \u03c90 )/hI\u03c1 (x)i does not depend on the\ntunneling distance (log \u0393), this is a clear indication that contacts do not\naffect this quasiparticle entanglement.\nAcknowledgements\nThe contribution on the Bell inequality tests for electrons was performed\nin collaboration with G.
