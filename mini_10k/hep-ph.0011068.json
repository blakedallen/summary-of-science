We also examine\nMSW transitions in these circumstances, and show that a sharpening of the\ntransition can result.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nWe examine a system consisting of an oscillating neutrino propagating through a dense\nmedium. This falls into the very broad class of problems in which a quantum system cannot\nbe considered closed or isolated, due to interaction of the system with an environment or\nheat bath. In particular we consider two-flavour neutrino oscillations in a medium such that\nthe system-bath interactions do not distinguish the flavour of the neutrino.\nAn example is the density matrix of a single neutrino undergoing \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations\nembedded in an electron-positron plasma. In some sense this example is similar to an early\nuniverse environment, though lacking some features of a realistic physical scenario, such as\nneutrino pair processes and the inclusion of other neutrino flavours. Another example in\nwhich flavour blind interactions are relevant is the case of \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations of neutrinos\ncoming from the core of a supernova. In this case, although the indices of refraction for \u03bd\u03bc and\n\u03bd\u03c4 will be different due to loop graph effects, the collision rates for the neutrinos scattering\nfrom the medium of nucleons will be the same for the two flavours, to a good approximation.\nHowever, it is the coherence properties of the system that are most intriguing, and which\nare worth studying independently of the various circumstances in which they may arise.\nAn analogue to the neutrino system is that of a double well coupled to a thermal bath, in\nwhich the neutrino flavour oscillations are replaced by oscillations from the left to the right\nside of the well. Our work provides an analytic treatment of the distinctive behaviour that\nwe noted previously in a numerical treatment of double well oscillations [1]. Since double\nwell systems are of general interest in condensed matter physics [2,3], the type of behaviour\nwe examine here may be expected to arise in various situations unrelated to neutrino physics.\nAs the medium cannot distinguish the flavour of the neutrino, the only effect of collisions\nwith particles in the medium is to change the value of the neutrino's energy (and to entangle\nthe neutrino with the environment). This is in contrast with active-sterile oscillations in\n1\n\n\fwhich collisions may in some sense be thought of as measuring the flavour of the neutrino. It\nis the consideration of the neutrino energy variable, and the rapid energy changing collisional\nprocesses that is crucial, and when the average collision rate is much larger than average\noscillation rate we find that a collective oscillation results [1]. That is, for a neutrino in a\nthermally distributed mixture of momentum states, the oscillations are synchronised despite\nbeing momentum dependent in the absence of collisions.\nWe stress that the novel synchronisation effect arises as a result of energy changing\nprocesses. In particular, the result is distinct from the synchronisation effect of ref. [4]\nwhich results from non-linear feedback, as we consider here only linear dynamics.\nA. The Quantum Kinetic Equations\n\nThe evolution equations for the neutrino density matrix have been formulated in ref.\n[5] for active-active oscillations, and ref. [6] for active-sterile oscillations. These Quantum\nKinetic Equations (QKEs) or Bloch equations, take into account both coherent oscillation\nbehaviour and potentially decoherent effects of interaction of the neutrino system with an environment. The QKEs are essentially Boltzmann equations, generalised to allow for quantal\ncoherence between particle species.\nWe choose to parametrise the neutrino density matrix as\n1\n\u03c1(p) = [P0 (p) + P(p) * \u03c3],\n(1)\n2\nwith\nP(p) \u2261 Px (p)x\u0302 + Py (p)\u0177 + Pz (p)\u1e91.\n\n(2)\n\nThe QKEs for a single neutrino undergoing elastic scattering in a medium which does\nnot distinguish flavour are [5]\nZ\nh\ni\n \u0307\n~\nP (k) = d3 k \u2032 \u0393(k \u2032 , k)P~ (k \u2032 ) \u2212 \u0393(k, k \u2032 )P~ (k) + V(k) \u00d7 P(k),\n\u1e560 (k) =\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ni\n\nd3 k \u2032 \u0393(k \u2032 , k)P0 (k \u2032 ) \u2212 \u0393(k, k \u2032 )P0 (k) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0393(k \u2032 , k) determines the rate at which neutrinos are scattered from momentum state\nk \u2032 to state k. Thermal equilibrium of the medium enforces\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(k \u2032 , k) = e(k \u2212k)/T \u0393(k, k \u2032 ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe cross product term describes precession of the neutrino flavour, where V(k) is given by\nV(k) = \u03b2(k)x\u0302 + \u03bb(k)\u1e91,\n\n(5)\n\nand the oscillation parameters are defined as\n\u03b4m2\nsin 2\u03b80 ,\n2k\n\u03b4m2\n\u03bb(k) = \u2212\ncos 2\u03b80 + Veff ,\n(6)\n2k\nwith \u03b80 being the vacuum mixing angle, \u03b4m2 the mass-squared difference, and Veff the\neffective matter potential resulting from coherent forward scattering.\n\u03b2(k) =\n\n2\n\n\fB. Qualitative features for different coupling strength.\n\nBy way of example, we consider the density matrix of a single \u03bd\u03bc \u2212\u03bd\u03c4 neutrino propagating\nin an electron-positron plasma. For simplicity, we shall ignore the interaction of the neutrino\nwith other \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 or \u03bd \u03bc,\u03c4 that may be produced in the plasma, and consider only the single\nneutrino and its interaction with electrons and positrons. That is, we consider in isolation\na particular subset of the various processes that may affect the evolution of the neutrino\ndensity matrix.\nFor our considerations it should suffice to take the following form for the scattering rate,\n\u0393(k, k \u2032 ) \u2243\n\n0.01 2 \u2032 \u2212k\u2032 /T\nG kk e\n,\n4\u03c0 F\n\n(7)\n\nas this embodies the correct threshold behaviour, the reciprocity relation (4) and leads to the\ncorrect total transition rate. We have solved the QKEs (3) numerically, and the results are\npresented in the graphs below, for various temperatures. For small temperatures, where the\naverage time between collisions is much longer than the oscillation period, we have just the\nsuperposition of (almost) undamped precession rates at different frequencies. For moderate\ncollisions rates we rapidly lose coherence in the neutrino system. This occurs simply because\nthe oscillation modes are momentum dependent. Collisional processes transfer quanta across\nthe momentum states which quickly get out of phase, and hence result in a damping of the\namplitude of the oscillations. The most fascinating effect, however, is obtained for larger\nvalues of \u0393 where the average time between collisions is much smaller than the oscillation\nperiod. In this limit we see a synchronisation of the oscillations of all the momentum states.\nHere, the precession proceeds at at a rate determined by the thermal average of V(k), and\ndamping is eliminated as the rapid collisions force the momentum modes to stay in phase.\nP\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nt\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1.

In each case,\nthe time is scaled by the inverse of the thermally averaged oscillation frequency.\n\n3\n\n\fWe define the entropy in the neutrino system as\ns=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nd3 kTr [\u03c1(k) ln \u03c1(k)] ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the trace is over the neutrino flavour index.

Entropy plotted for the same parameters as fig.1, where S=s(t)-s(t=0).\n\nLet us compare this behaviour with the familiar Quantum Zeno behaviour in activesterile neutrino systems. In both cases the rate of entropy growth increases as we increase the\ninteraction rate between the neutrino system and the environment, and then decreases again\nif we make the interaction rate much larger than the oscillation rate. In the active-sterile\ncase however, this occurs because the \"measurement-like\" interactions freeze the neutrino\nin its initial state. In contrast, in our case the flavour precession proceeds as though it were\na single mode of an isolated system.\nII. ANALYTIC SOLUTION FOR LARGE COLLISION RATE\n\nWe now show analytically that a synchronised solution follows from the Eqs. (3) in the\nlarge \u0393 limit. We begin be discretizing the equations, by allowing the momentum to take\nthe values k1 , k2 , ....kN . Expressing the resulting 3N equations in matrix form we have\n\u1e56 = MP,\n\n(9)\n\nP = (Px1 , ..., PxN , Py1 , ..., PyN , Pz1 , ..., PzN )T .\n\n(10)\n\nwhere P is the vector\n\nThe matrix M, has the following block form\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nG \u2212\u039b 0\n\uf8f7\nM=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u039b G \u2212B \uf8f8 ,\n0 B G\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhere\nGij = \u0393ji kj2 \u2212 \u03b4ij\n\nX\n\n\u0393ik kk2 ,\n\nk\n\n\u039b = diag(\u03bb1 , .....\u03bbN ),\nB = diag(\u03b21 , .....\u03b2N ).\n\n(12)\n\nTo solve for P(t), we introduce a matrix U which diagonalises M such that\nP = UQ,\n\n(13)\n\nQ\u0307 = Mdiag Q \u2212 U \u22121 U\u0307Q,\n\n(14)\n\nMdiag \u2261 U \u22121 MU.\n\n(15)\n\nand\n\nwhere\n\nWe shall consider time independent \u03bb and \u03b2, so that U\u0307 = 0, and the solution to eq.(14) is\nPi (t) =\n\nX\nj\n\nUij Qj (t) =\n\nX\nj\n\nexp [(Mdiag )jj t] Uij Qj (0).\n\n(16)\n\nThe procedure may also be adapted for time dependent mixing where \u03bb and \u03b2 change\nsufficiently slowly that an adiabatic approximation is valid.1\nSince wish to find the solution in the large \u0393 limit, we first drop the \u03bb and \u03b2 terms. Then\nwe see that M has three zero eigenvalues, with eigenvectors that are linear combinations of\n\u0011T\n\u0011T\n1 \u0010 \u2212k/T\n1 \u0010 \u2212k/T \u0011T\n1 \u0010\ne\n, 0, 0 , y2 = \u221a\n0, e\n,0\n0, 0, e\u2212k/T ,\nand y3 = \u221a\ny1 = \u221a\nN\nN\nN\n\n(17)\n\nwhere e\u2212k/T denotes (e\u2212k1 /T , e\u2212k2 /T , ..., e\u2212kN /T ).

MSW SHARPENING\n\nWe now consider the case where there is an MSW resonance, but the collision rates are\nstill flavour blind. For example, imagine that our plasma has a nucleon component, or a\nlepton excess. The effective potential arises at 1 loop level, and is given by [8]\nm2W\n3G2F m2\u03c4\n(N\n+\nN\n)\nln\nV =\np\nn\n2\u03c0 2\nm2\u03c4\n\"\n\n!\n\n#\n\n2\n\u2212 Np \u2212 Nn .\n3\n\n(27)\n\nWe need only a very small nucleon component for this potential to be significant. For\nexample, assuming a mass squared difference of \u03b4m2 \u223c 10\u22123 eV2 , a nucleon density of Nn \u223c\n10\u22123 Ne would give rise to an MSW resonance at a temperature of roughly 10 MeV. If the\nnucleon density were smaller, the resonance would occur at higher temperature.\nTo illustrate the type of effect that could arise, we assume, by way of example, an\nexponentially decreasing effective matter potential. We take for our initial condition a\nneutrino in a definite flavour state with a thermal distribution of momentum values, and plot\nbelow the probability that the neutrino remains in that initial flavour state. In the absence\nof neutrino-environment interaction, each momentum state goes through the resonance at a\ndifferent time resulting in a broad transition region, while for moderate interaction rate the\noscillations get dephased and the neutrino ends up in an equal mixture of the two flavour\nstates. For large interaction rate, we see the effect of synchronised behaviour - all momentum\nstates go through the resonance at the same time, resulting in a much sharper transition.\nP\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nt\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFIG. 3. \"MSW sharpening\".

CONCLUSION\n\nWhen rapid scattering processes are flavour blind, a neutrino in a mixture of momentum\nstates undergoes synchronised flavour oscillations. This collective, dissipationless behaviour\nhas been demonstrated numerically and derived analytically. Under these circumstances\nMSW transitions become sharper as all momentum states go through the resonance together.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe work of NFB is supported by the Commonwealth of Australia, RFS by NSF grant\nPHY-9900544 and RRV by the Australian Research Council.\n\n[1] N.
