INTRODUCTION\n\nlimit if we keep fixed the 't Hooft coupling\n\nHow SU(N ) gauge theories approach their N =\n\u221e limit and what that limit is, are interesting questions [1], in themselves, whose answers\nwould, in addition, represent a significant step towards addressing the same question in the context\nof QCD. Accurate lattice calculations in 2+1 dimensions [2] show that in that case the approach\nis remarkably precocious in that even N = 2 is\nclose to N = \u221e. Such calculations have to be\nvery accurate because for each value of N one\nhas to perform a continuum extrapolation of various mass ratios and then these are compared and\nextrapolated to N = \u221e. Earlier D=3+1 calculations [3,4] were much too rough for this purpose\neven if their message was optimistic. Recently,\nhowever, this situation has been rapidly improving and here I want to describe some of the things\nthat one has already learned.\nAnalyses of Feynman diagrams to all orders imply [1], that the SU(N ) theory will have a smooth\n\n\u03bb \u2261 g 2 N.\n\n\u2217 Invited\n\ntalk given at the Workshop on Lattice Hadron\nPhysics (LHP2001), July 9-18, 2001 in Cairns, Australia.\n\n(1)\n\nWe would like a non-perturbative confirmation\nof this expectation. Again, we would like a\nconfirmation of the assumption that the largeN theory remains confining, since much of the\nphenomenological argument that QCD might be\nclose to N = \u221e relies on this being so [1]. Since\nquarks are in the fundamental representation, the\nleading correction to N = \u221e is expected to be\nO(1/N ). In the pure gauge theory it is expected\nto be O(1/N 2 ). (Again an expectation that one\nwould wish to test non-perturbatively.) Thus if\nQCD is close to N = \u221e one would expect the\nSU(3) gauge theory to be close to SU(\u221e) as well.\nWe can test this by calculating dimensionless ratios of physical masses as a function of N . There\nare also arguments and speculations (e.g. [5])\nthat topological fluctuations are very different at\nlarge N and at small N ; this too we would like to\ntest in lattice simulations.\nThe calculations [6,7] on glueballs, topology\nand k-strings which I will describe have been performed in collaboration with Biagio Lucini. The\nstrategy is simple: we calculate the relevant (con-\n\n\f2\ntinuum) properties of SU(2), SU(3), SU(4) and\nSU(5) theories and directly compare them. Since\nN = 5 is large in the sense that the leading correction \u221d 1/N 2 = 1/25 \u226a 1, it is not surprising\nthat such a calculation turns out to suffice for\nour purposes. These calculations were intended\nas exploratory. A much larger calculation is now\nunderway and this will provide much more information on the mass spectrum and its dependence\non the number of colours.\n2. FROM LATTICE TO PHYSICS\nOur lattice calculations are entirely standard\n[6,7]. The Euclidean space-time lattice is hypercubic with periodic boundary conditions.The degrees of freedom are SU(N ) matrices residing on\nthe links of the lattice. In the partition function\nthe fields are weighted with exp{S} where S is\nthe standard plaquette action\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n1\n(2)\nS = \u2212\u03b2\n1 \u2212 ReT r Up ,\nN\np\nin which Up is the ordered product of the matrices\non the boundary of the plaquette p. For smooth\nfields this action reduces to the usual continuum\naction with \u03b2 = 2N/g 2 . For rough fields on a\nlattice of spacing a we can define a running lattice\ncoupling gL (a) which reduces in the continuum\nlimit to a coupling g(a) in our favourite scheme:\n\u03b2\u2261\n\n2N a\u21920 2N\n2 (a) \u2212\u2192 g 2 (a)\ngL\n\n(3)\n\nThus by varying the inverse lattice coupling \u03b2 we\ncan vary the lattice spacing a.\nTo calculate a mass we construct some operator\n\u03c6(t) with the quantum numbers of the state (typically this will be a linear combination of the products of link matrices around some closed loops)\nand then use the standard decomposition of the\nEuclidean correlator in terms of energy eigenstates\nX\nC(t) = h\u03c6\u2020 (t)\u03c6(0)i =\n|h\u03a9|\u03c6|ni|2 exp{\u2212En t}(4)\nn\n\nwhere |ni are the energy eigenstates, with En the\ncorresponding energies, and |\u03a9i is the vacuum\nstate. We evaluate the corresponding Feynman\n\nPath Integrals using standard Monte Carlo techniques. On the lattice t = na and so we obtain\nthe energies from eqn(4) as aEn i.e. in units of\nthe lattice spacing. In practice one needs to use\nseveral carefully chosen operators, and a variational calculation [6,7]. Since our volume is finite\nwe must make sure that finite volume corrections\nare negligible. For the calculations I describe here\nsuch checks have been made.\nHaving calculated some masses ami at a fixed\nvalue of a (i.e. at a fixed value of \u03b2) we can remove lattice units by taking ratios: ami /amj =\nmi /mj . This ratio differs from the desired continuum value by lattice corrections. For our action\nthe functional form of the leading correction is\nknown to be O(a2 ). Thus for small enough a we\ncan extrapolate our calculated mass values\nmi (0)\nmi (a)\n=\n+ ca2 m2k (a)\nmj (a)\nmj (0)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere using different mk will make differences at\nO(a4 ) (as does the a-dependence of mk (a)). We\nshall later show some explicit examples of such\nextrapolations.\nHaving calculated such mass ratios in various\ncontinuum SU(N ) gauge theories, we can attempt\nto extrapolate to N = \u221e using the fact that the\nleading correction is expected to be O(1/N 2 ):\nmi\nmj\n\n=\nN\n\nmi\nmj\n\n+\n\u221e\n\ncij\n.\nN2\n\n(6)\n\nIf such fits are good for N \u2265 N0 then we may\nregard SU(N0 ) as being close to SU(\u221e).\n3. GLUEBALLS\nIn this exploratory calculation we focus on\nwhat are expected (from previous calculations in\nSU(2) and SU(3) [9,10]) to be the lightest states:\nthe lightest J P C = 0++ and 2++ glueballs. We\nalso calculate the mass of the first excited scalar\nglueball, which we shall refer to as the 0++\u22c6 . In\naddition to these glueball masses we calculate the\nstring tension, a2 \u03c3, of the flux tube between static\nsources in the fundamental representation (see\nthe next Section.). This last is our most accurately calculated quantity and so \u221a\nwe use it to form\nthe dimensionless mass ratios m/ \u03c3 which we extrapolate to the continuum limit using eqn(5).

The\na \u2192 0 continuum extrapolation, using a leading\nlattice correction, is shown.\n\nFigure 2. Continuum scalar, tensor and excited\nscalar masses expressed in units of the string tension and plotted against 1/N 2 . Linear extrapolations to N = \u221e are shown in each case.\n4. 'T HOOFT COUPLING\n\nFig.1 I show you how this works for the lightest\nscalar glueball for N = 2, 3, 4, 5.\nWhile the mass of the scalar glueball is the\nmost accurately calculated, because it is the lightest, it is also the one with (by far) the largest lattice corrections. Despite this it is already clear\nfrom Fig.1 that for small a there is very little N dependence for N \u2265 3. To be quantitative we\nperform continuum extrapolations using eqn(5),\nas shown in Fig.1. The results are shown in Fig.2\nwhere we also show the extrapolations to N = \u221e\nusing eqn(6).\nWe see from Fig.2 that, as far as the lightest\nglueballs are concerned, all SU(N ) theories can\nbe described by a modest leading O(1/N 2 ) correction to the SU(\u221e) limit.\nWe also see from these plots that the ratio of\nthe glueball masses to the (square root of) the\nstring tension has a finite non-zero limit as N \u2192\n\u221e. This tells us that the confining string tension\nremains finite and non-zero as N \u2192 \u221e. (Caution:\nnumerical calculations only test confinement to\nsome finite distance \u2013 which in the case of our\nhigher-N calculations is not yet very large.)\n\nThe analysis of diagrams [1] suggests that the\nway to achieve a smooth limit as N \u2192 \u221e is by\nkeeping the 't Hooft coupling, \u03bb \u2261 g 2 N , constant.\nSince the coupling runs, we should say that what\nwe keep fixed is the running 't Hooft coupling, as\ndefined on some scale l that is fixed in units of\nsome quantity that partakes of the smooth largeN limit, such as the string tension. To do this we\nuse eqn(3) which tells is that a suitable defintion\nof a running 't Hooft coupling is\n\u03bbI (a) = gI2 (a)N =\n\n2N 2\n\u03b2hReT r Up /N i\n\n(7)\n\nThe extra factor involving the plaquette is a\nmean-field (or tadpole) improved version of \u03b2 and\nthe naive \u03bb(a) we would derive from it [11]. It is\nnecessary [11] because the naive lattice coupling\nis known to be very poor in the sense of having\nvery large higher order corrections.\nWe extract \u03bbI (a) for each of our various lattice\ncalculations at various N and a . Our\n\u221a diagrammatic expectation is that if we plot a \u03c3 against\n\u03bbI (a) then, for large enough N , the calculated\n\n\f4\n\u2032\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\na\u03c3\n\n1/2\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\nSU(2)\nSU(3)\nSU(4)\nSU(5)\n\n0.1\n\n0\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n\u03bb\u0399\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\nFigure 3.

We observe that, within corrections which are small except at the largest\nvalue of a, we do indeed see a universal curve, and\nso the diagrammatic expectation is supported by\nour non-perturbative calculations [6].\n5. STRINGS\nIn a confining SU(N ) gauge theory, the potential between two static charges in the fundamental representation is expected to grow linearly at\nlarge separations as V (r) = \u03c3r where \u03c3 is the\nfundamental string tension. If we have charges in\nother representations then, in SU(3), they can be\nscreened to either the fundamental or the trivial\nrepresentation by gluons from the vacuum. So the\nfundamental string is the only stable one (assuming it to have the lowest tension). In SU(N \u2265 4)\nthere are other stable strings. It is convenient to\nlabel a charge by the integer k if its wave function transforms by a factor of z k under a global\ngauge transformation z belonging to the centre\nZN of the group. Because gluons transform trivially under the centre, they cannot screen a charge\n\nof k into a charge of k \u2032 if z k 6= z k . Thus there\nshould be a different stable string for each such\nk, with string tension \u03c3k . (Conjugate strings will\nhave the same tensions.) Of course, it might be\nthat we just have k fundamental strings joining\nsuch sources, in which case one will find \u03c3k = k\u03c3\nand we have no new string. As we shall see, this is\nnot the case: we find new tightly bound k-strings.\nThe first k = 2 string appears in SU(4) and the\nfirst k = 3 one in SU(6). The values of \u03c3k are\ninteresting because they carry information about\nconfinement. Also because there are specific conjectures about their values from M(-theory)QCD\n[8], from arguments about Casimir scaling [12],\nand from certain models, such as the bag model\n[13]. Moreover such strings may have striking implications [6,7] for the glueball mass spectrum as\na function of N .\nThe simplest way to calculate \u03c3k is by calculating the mass of a k-string that winds around\na spatial torus. In a confining theory it cannot\nbreak and will have a length l = aL (on an L3\nspatial lattice). For long enough strings, the mass\nof such a loop is given by\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nmk (l) \u2243 \u03c3k l \u2212\n\n\u03c0(D \u2212 2) cs\n.\n6\nl\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the O(1/l) correction is the Casimir energy of a periodic string and cs is proportional\nto the central charge. This correction is universal [14] since it depends only upon the massless\nmodes in the effective string theory and does not\ndepend upon the detailed and complicated dynamics of the flux tube on scales comparable to\nits width. The central charge is given [15] by the\nnumber of massless bosonic and fermionic modes\nthat propagate along the string. In practice it\nis usually assumed that cs = 1, corresponding\nto the simplest possible (Nambu-Goto) bosonic\nstring theory. However, these modes are not related to the fundamental degrees of freedom of\nour SU(N ) gauge theory in any transparent way\nand the presence of fermionic modes is certainly\nnot excluded. Direct numerical evidence is hard\nto get since we are interested in small corrections\nto long, massive strings. In Fig.4 we show the\neffective value of cs that one obtains [7] by fitting the masses of two strings of different lengths\n\n\f5\n\nClearly the k = 2 string is tightly bound, and\nthe string tension is incompatible, for example,\nwith the naive bag model. What we find is that\nit falls between the MQCD and Casimir scaling\npredictions and, at the two sigma level, is consistent with both. We remark that a very recent\nhigher statistics calculation [16] favours MQCD\nover Casimir scaling.\n6. TOPOLOGY\nGauge fields in four (suitably compactified) Euclidean dimensions possess non-trivial topological\nproperties characterised by an integer topological\ncharge Q. Topological fluctuations break the (approximate) UA (1) symmetry of QCD, thus leading [17] to the non-Goldstone character of the \u03b7 \u2032 .\nOne can argue that if N = 3 is close to N = \u221e\none can relate [18] the mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 to the topological susceptibility\n\u03c7t \u2261\n\nhQ2 i\n,\nV\n\n(10)\n\nof the gauge theory without quarks. (V is the\nspace-time volume.) This suggests a value \u03c7t \u2243\n(180M eV )4 , which is indeed close to what one\nfinds in pure gauge theories [19]. All this fits together if we can show that the N = 3 values of the\npure gauge susceptibility and of N m2\u03b7\u2032 are close\nto their N = \u221e values. While we cannot say\nmuch about the latter, we can and shall address\nthe former.\nWe calculate Q for our lattice fields by standard cooling methods which for this purpose are\nreliable [19]. These calculations are performed\nsimultaneously with the glueball calculations dis1/4 \u221a\ncussed earlier and the values of \u03c7t / \u03c3 are extrapolated to the continuum limit with an a2 \u03c3\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\ncs\n\neff\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nL\n\nFigure 4.

To do so we examine the topological charge density on the cooled fields and associate an instanton to each peak in this density\nusing the semiclassical formula\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n1/4\n\n\u03c7t /\u03c3\n\n1/2\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n1/N\n\nQpeak =\n\nFigure 6. The continuum topological susceptibility in units of the string tension plotted against\n1/N 2 . A linear extrapolation to N = \u221e is shown.\ncorrection, following eqn(5). The resulting continuum values are plotted against 1/N 2 in Fig.6\nWe observe that, just as for the glueball masses,\nthe N -dependence is well described by a modest\nO(1/N 2 ) correction and the topological susceptibility, expressed in physical units, does not differ\ngreatly when we go from N = 3 to N = \u221e.\nThese conclusions are somewhat weaker here\nthan for the glueballa because of the rapidly growing errors as N increases. The reason for this\nturns out to be interesting and easy to see [6].\nAs N grows isolated instantons become increasingly unlikely. This is because of the factor in the\ninstanton density\n(\n)N\n8\u03c0 2\nb2 \u2212 \u03bb(\u03c1)\nd\u03c1 1\ne\nD(\u03c1)d\u03c1 \u221d\n.\n(11)\n\u03c1 \u03c14 \u03bb2 (\u03c1)\nwhere \u03bb is the 't Hooft coupling that we keep\nfixed as N \u2192 \u221e. In the real vacuum this argument holds for instantons with \u03c1 \u226a 1 'fermi' and\nso these instantons are exponentially suppressed\nas N increases. Now the Monte Carlo changes Q\nby an instanton shrinking through small values\nof \u03c1 down to \u03c1 \u223c a where it can vanish through\nthe lattice. (Or the reverse process.) However\n\n6\n.\n\u03c0 2 \u03c14\n\n(12)\n\nThis procedure is clearly of ambiguous validity\nfor broad instantons, but is unambiguous for the\nhigh narrow peaks that correspond to the smaller\ninstantons of interest to us here. In Fig.7 we display the result of such a calculation, comparing\nthe instanton densities in SU(2), SU(3) and SU(4)\non lattices with (almost) equal volumes and lattice spacings when expressed in units of the string\ntension. We clearly see a drastic suppression of\nsmall instantons with increasing N .\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nWe saw above that, as far as the lightest glueballs, string tensions and topological susceptibility are concerned, all SU(N ) theories can be described by a modest leading O(1/N 2 ) correction\nto the SU(\u221e) limit. In this sense we can say that\nnot only is N = 3 close to N = \u221e but so is N = 2.\nThe large amount of interesting physics delivered by these modest (workstation) calculations,\nprovides a strong motivation for going further.\nCurrently we [20] are starting much larger calculations on anisotropic lattices, which will enable\nus to obtain accurate mass estimates for a much\nlarger range of glueball states and very accurate\nstring tension ratios. Simultaneously we [21] are\nusing overlap fermions [22] to determine the relationship between topology and chiral symmetry\nbreaking as a function of N ; and to say something\nabout instantons and topology at large N .
