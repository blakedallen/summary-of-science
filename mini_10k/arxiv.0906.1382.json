The two phases may\nbe expressed as \u03b4I = aI k where k is the pion momentum in the center of mass frame and parameters\na0 and a2 are called S-wave pion scattering lengths\nand are fundamental quantities of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Experimentally, one may access to the\ntwo parameters by studying the \u03c0\u03c0 final state rescattering effects which are related to a0 and a2 . In the following we discuss separately K \u2192 3\u03c0 and Ke4 cases.\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c00\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\n\u03c00\n\nK+\n\n\u03c0+\n+\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: 1 loop Feynmann Diagram for K \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 2: Distrubution of the two neutral pion invariant\nmass squared m00 and zoom of the Cusp.\n\nK \u2192 3\u03c0\n\nLet's consider the contribution of the 1 loop charge\nexchange Feynmann diagram, shown in Fig. 1, to the\ndecay K \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . If m+ indicates the charged\npion mass, one may expect a threshold effect when\nthe two neutral pion invariant mass takes the value\nm00 = 2m+ which corresponds to a square root like\nsingularity in the amplitude. The interference of this\nparticular diagram with the tree level process generates a discontinuity in the first derivative of the m00\nspectrum. This singular behaviour of cross section\nnear threshold is a well known phenomenon studied\nin the past by Wigner [1] and is commonly called\n\"Wigner Cusp\" or simply \"Cusp\" in the following.\nThe cusp structure has been clearly seen by experiment NA48 with a sample of 60 \u00d7 106 fully reconstructed K \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events. The experimental distribution of m00 is shown in Fig. (2). A calculation\nof the effect has been published by N. Cabibbo and\nG. Isidori [2] [3] where the amplitude of the dominant\ncharge-exchange diagram is parametrized in terms of\npion scattering lengths as\ns\n\u0012\n\u00132\nm00\nM \u221d (a0 \u2212 a2 ) 1 \u2212\n2m+\nHigher order terms involve different linear combinations of a0 and a2 . The cited theoretical models have\nbeen implemented by NA48 in a fitting procedure to\nthe experimental data in order to extract the scattering lengths parameters. The analysis is discussed in\nreference [5]. The fitting region has been restricted\n2\nto the range 0.074 \u2264 m200 \u2264 0.097(GeV/c )2 because the theoretical model adopted was developed\nas a Taylor expansion around the cusp threshold. A\nfew bins around the cusp have been also excluded\nfrom the fitting to limit the effect of Coulomb corrections and Pionium formation (i.e. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 electromagnetic bound state) [6]. The quality of the fit is\ngood (\u03c72 = 145.5/139) and the values found are:\n(a0 \u2212 a2 )m+ = 0.268 \u00b1 0.010(stat)\n\u00b10.004(syst) \u00b1 0.013(ext)\na2 m+ = \u22120.041 \u00b1 0.022(stat) \u00b1 0.014(syst)\nThe two statistical errors from the fit are strongly\ncorrelated with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.858.\n\n\f2\n\nHeavy Quarks and Leptons, Melbourne, 2008\nThe external error quoted reflects the impact of uncertainties on branching ratios and form factors entering\nin the fitting procedure as well as an additional \u00b15%\ntheoretical error estimated in reference [3] quoted as\nthe uncertainty from neglecting higher-order terms\nand radiative corrections in the rescattering model.\nA theoretical approach, alternative to CabibboIsidori model, has been published in [4]. In the future, this new model will be tested also on the sample\nof \u223c 100 \u00d7 106 KL \u2192 3\u03c0 0 , collected by NA48 in the\nyear 2000, where a similar cusp structure, though attenuated with respect to the charged Kaon case, has\nbeen seen. Data are being re-analyzed. KTEV has\nrecently published a study on the KL \u2192 3\u03c0 0 Dalitz\nplot [8] and the results found are in agreement with\nthe NA48 measurements discussed here. Other experiments have tried to look for an equivalent cusp structure in \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 but the statistical power reached so\nfar is not enough [7].\nIII.\n\nK \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e\u00b1 \u03bd\n\ne+\n\u03bd\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0+\n\nK+\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nFIG. 3: Feynmann diagram for Ke4 decay with final state\nrescattering\n\nexpanding them into partial wave and into a Taylor series in q 2 = m2\u03c0\u03c0 /4m2+ \u2212 1, the following parametrization is used to determine form factors from the experimental data\n\u0001\nF = fs + fs\u2032 q 2 + fs\u2032\u2032 q 4 ei\u03b4S\n\u0001\nG = gp + gp\u2032 q 2 + ei\u03b4P + fp cos\u03b8\u03c0 ei\u03b4P\nH = hp ei\u03b4P\n\nThe phase difference between S and P wave \u03b4 =\n\u03b4S \u2212 \u03b4P changes as the two pion invariant mass m\u03c0\u03c0\nincreases in a way involving the parameters a0 and a2\nthrough a relation known as Roy equation [10]. A determination of the scattering lengths may be extracted\nfrom several measurement of the phase \u03b4 at different\nm\u03c0\u03c0 values. A measurement of \u03b4 for a particular value\nof m\u03c0\u03c0 can be done by measuring the \u03a6 distibution\nasymmetry, where \u03a6 is the angle between the plane\ncontaining pions and the one containing leptons. The\nsensitivity on \u03b4 is higher at high value of m\u03c0\u03c0 .\nExperiment NA48 collected a sample of 6.7 \u00d7 105\nfully reconstructed Ke4 decays. Assuming the \u2206S =\n\u2206Q rule, which is true in the weak sector of the Standard Model, one can estimate the background to the\nKe4 reconstruction procedure by measuring the fraction of event with \"wrong sign lepton\" or, equivalently,\nevent with same charge pions. The background is\nknown to within a precision of 0.1%. Experimental\ndata are summarized in Fig. 4. Let's remark that\nso far minimal theoretical inputs have been required\nand Fig. 4 is almost model independent. On the contrary, theoretical guidance is necessary when one tries\nto extract the scattering lengths from the phase shift.\nThe Roy equation has been implemented in the fitting as well as a theoretical constraint between a0 and\na2 known as universal band [11]. Additional isospin\nbreaking effects have also been taken into account\nfollowing indications given in [12]. The final results\nfound from Ke4 analysis [13] are consistent with the\nones found from K \u2192 3\u03c0\na0 m+ = 0.233 \u00b1 0.016(stat) \u00b1 0.007(syst)\na2 m+ = \u22120.0471 \u00b1 0.011(stat) \u00b1 0.004(syst)\n\nFIG. 4: Phase shift versus m\u03c0 \u03c0\n\nThe Feymann diagram in Fig. 3 shows one of the\npossibile rescattering process which may occur.

After\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLarge statistics sample of Kaon semi-leptonic and\nnon-leptonic decays collected by NA48 experiment\nprovided precise measurements of the pion S-wave\nscattering lengths. Results from the two different processes considered are consistent with each other and\nboth agree with the result published by DIRAC collaboration [14] which uses a total different experimental approach not involving kaons.\nResults are in excellent agreement with theoretical\npredictions [15] , [16] and the level of experimental\n\n\fHeavy Quarks and Leptons, Melbourne, 2008\nuncertainties allows one to conclude that scattering\nlengths measurements are so far the most stringent\ntest of the Chiral Theory. The importance of these\ntests can be easily understood considering the role\nplayed by chiral symmetry effective theory in the context of flavour physics.\n\nFIG. 5: Plane (a0 , a2 ), NA48 and DIRAC results comparison.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the organizers of the\n\"Heavy Quarks and Leptons\" 2008 Australian edition and in particular Elisabetta Barberio for her wise\ncomments about the significance of the measurements\npresented here.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nE.P.
