We prove that if q is in (1, \u221e), Y is a Banach space, and T is a\nlinear operator defined on the space of finite linear combinations of (1, q)-atoms\nin Rn with the property that\nsup{kT akY : a is a (1, q)-atom} < \u221e,\nthen T admits a (unique) continuous extension to a bounded linear operator\nfrom H 1 (Rn ) to Y . We show that the same is true if we replace (1, q)-atoms\nby continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms. This is known to be false for (1, \u221e)-atoms.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn a recent paper, M. Bownik [3] showed that there exists a linear functional F\ndefined on finite linear combinations of (1, \u221e)-atoms in Rn with the property that\nsup{|F (a)| : a is a (1, \u221e)-atom} < \u221e,\nbut which does not admit a continuous extension to H 1 (Rn ). If v is a fixed function\nin L1 (Rn )\\{0}, then the operator B, defined on finite linear combinations of (1, \u221e)atoms by Bf = F (f ) v, satisfies\nsup{kBakL1 (Rn ) : a is a (1, \u221e)-atom} < \u221e,\nbut does not admit an extension to a bounded operator from H 1 (Rn ) to L1 (Rn ).\nThis shows that the argument \"the operator T maps (1, \u221e)-atoms uniformly into\nL1 (Rn ), and hence it extends to a bounded operator from H 1 (Rn ) to L1 (Rn )\" is\nfallacious.\nFortunately, if T is a Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator, then the uniform boundedness of T on (1, \u221e)-atoms implies the boundedness from H 1 (Rn ) to L1 (Rn ) (see,\nfor instance, [11, Ch. 7.3, Lemma 1], [2, Ch. 1.9], [7, Ch. III.7] and [8, Thm 6.7.1]).\nThe purpose of this paper is to show that the operator B constructed above is, to\na certain extent, pathological. Indeed, we prove that if q is in (1, \u221e), Y is a Banach\nspace, and T is a linear operator on finite linear combinations of (1, q)-atoms in Rn\nwith the property that\n(1.1)\n\nsup{kT akY : a is a (1, q)-atom} < \u221e,\n\nthen T admits a unique continuous extension to a bounded linear operator from\nH 1 (Rn ) to Y . The same conclusion holds if we assume that T is a linear operator\non finite linear combinations of continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms in Rn with the property\nthat\n(1.2)\n\nsup{kT akY : a is a continuous (1, \u221e)-atom} < \u221e.\n\nDate: June 18, 2007 and, in revised form, October 05, 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 42B30, 46A22.\nKey words and phrases.

Indeed, the restriction of\ne from\nthe operator B to continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms extends to a bounded operator B\ne will agree on continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms but\nH 1 (Rn ) to L1 (Rn ). However, B and B\nnot on all (1, \u221e)-atoms.\nTo explain the idea of the proofs of these results, we need more notation. Suppose\n1,q\nthat q is in (1, \u221e], and denote by Hfin\n(Rn ) the vector space of all finite linear\n1,q\ncombinations of (1, q)-atoms. Notice that Hfin\n(Rn ) consists of all Lq (Rn ) functions\n1,q\n(Rn ) is a dense subspace of\nwith compact support and integral 0. Clearly, Hfin\n1,q\nH 1 (Rn ). We may define a norm on Hfin (Rn ) as follows\n\nkf kH 1,q (Rn ) = inf\nfin\n\nN\nnX\n\n|\u03bbj | : f =\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\no\n\u03bbj aj , aj is a (1, q)-atom, N \u2208 N .\n\n1,q\nObviously kf kH 1 (Rn ) \u2264 kf kH 1,q (Rn ) for every f in Hfin\n(Rn ). An example due to\nfin\nY. Meyer, see [12, p. 513], Bownik's paper [3] or [7, p. 370], shows that k*kH 1 (Rn )\n1,\u221e\nand k*kH 1,\u221e (Rn ) are inequivalent norms on Hfin\n(Rn ). This is the starting-point of\nfin\nBownik's construction.\nWe prove that Meyer's example itself is somewhat exceptional. Indeed, by using\nthe maximal characterisation of H 1 (Rn ), we show that if q < \u221e, then k*kH 1 (Rn )\n1,q\nand k*kH 1,q (Rn ) are equivalent norms on Hfin\n(Rn ) (see Section 3). Similarly, we\nfin\n\n1,\u221e\nprove that k*kH 1 (Rn ) and k*kH 1,\u221e (Rn ) are equivalent norms on Hfin\n(Rn ) \u2229 C(Rn ).\nfin\n\n1,q\nThis immediately implies that operators defined on Hfin\n(Rn ) which have either\nproperty (1.1) or property (1.2) automatically extend to bounded operators from\nH 1 (Rn ) to L1 (Rn ).\nAs discussed briefly in Section 3, this equivalence of norms remains true for\nH p (Rn ) with 0 < p < 1 and (p, q)-atoms.\nThe extension property for operators was also proved, by different methods, for\n0 < p \u2264 1 and (p, 2)-atoms and operators taking values in quasi-Banach spaces, by\nD. Yang and Y. Zhou [YZ].\nA theory of Hardy spaces has been developed in spaces of homogeneous type;\nsee R.R. Coifman and G. Weiss [5]. It is, however, not evident whether our results\nextend to this case in general. Nevertheless, let M be such a space. By a simple\nfunctional analysis argument, we show that if q is in (1, \u221e) and T is an operator\n1,q\ndefined on Hfin\n(M ) satisfying the analogue of (1.1), then T automatically extends\nto a bounded operator from H 1 (M ) to L1 (M ) (see Section 4). It may be worth\nnoticing that the proof of this result applies also to certain metric measured spaces\n(M, \u03c1, \u03bc) where \u03bc is only \"locally doubling\" [10, 4, V].\nFor so-called RD-spaces, which are spaces of homogeneous type having \"dimension n\" in a certain sense, our full results were recently extended in the paper [9]\nby L. Grafakos, L. Liu and Yang. These authors consider n/(n + 1) < p \u2264 1 and\nquasi-Banach-valued operators.\nThe authors wish to thank N.Th. Varopoulos for useful conversations on the\nsubject of this paper.\n\n\fON THE H 1 \u2013L1 BOUNDEDNESS OF OPERATORS\n\n3\n\n2. Notation and terminology\nSuppose that (M, \u03c1, \u03bc) is a space of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman\nand Weiss [5] and that \u03bc is a \u03c3-finite measure. For the sake of simplicity, we shall\nassume that \u03bc(M ) is infinite.\nSuppose that q is in (1, \u221e]. For each closed ball B in M , we denote by Lq0 (B)\nthe space of all functions in Lq (M ) which are supported in B and have integral 0.\nClearly Lq0 (B) is a closed subspace of Lq (M ). The union of all spaces Lq0 (B) as\nB varies over all balls coincides with the space Lqc,0 (M ) of all functions in Lq (M )\nwith compact support and integral 0. Fix a reference point o in M and for each\npositive integer k denote by Bk the ball centred at o with radius k. A convenient\nway of topologising Lqc,0 (M ) is to interpret Lqc,0 (M ) as the strict inductive limit of\nthe spaces Lqc,0 (Bk ) (see [1, II, p. 33] for the definition of the strict inductive limit\ntopology). We denote by X q the space Lqc,0 (M ) with this topology, and write Xkq\nfor Lqc,0 (Bk ).\nWe recall the basic definitions and results concerning the atomic Hardy space\nH 1 (M ). The reader is referred to [5] and the references therein for this and more on\nHardy spaces defined on spaces of homogeneous type. Suppose that q is in (1, \u221e].\nA (1, q)-atom is a function a in Lq (M ) supported in a ball B, with mean value 0\nand such that\n\u0010 1 Z\n\u00111/q\n|a|q d\u03bc\n\u2264 \u03bc(B)\u22121\n\u03bc(B) B\nif q is finite, and kak\u221e \u2264 \u03bc(B)\u22121 if q = \u221e. We denote by H 1,q (M ) theP\nspace of\nall functions g in L1 (M ) which admit a decomposition of the form g = j \u03bbj aj ,\nP\nwhere the aj are (1, q)-atoms and the \u03bbj are complex numbers such that j |\u03bbj | <\nP\n\u221e. The norm kgkH 1,q of g in H 1,q (M ) is the infimum of j |\u03bbj | over all such\ndecompositions. It is well known that all the spaces H 1,q (M ) with q \u2208 (1, \u221e)\ncoincide with H 1,\u221e (M ), and we denote them all by H 1 (M ). Clearly, the vector\n1,q\nspace Hfin\n(M ) of all finite linear combinations of (1, q)-atoms is dense in H 1 (M )\n1,q\nwith respect to the norm of H 1 (M ), for q in (1, \u221e]. Observe also that Hfin\n(M ) and\nq\nLc,0 (M ) agree as vector spaces, and so do the space of finite linear combinations of\n1,\u221e\ncontinuous (1, \u221e)-atoms and Hfin\n(M ) \u2229 C(Rn ).\nFor each ball B and each locally integrable function f , we denote by fB the\naverage of f on B. Recall that BM O is the Banach space of all locally integrable\nfunctions f , defined modulo constants, such that\nZ\n1\nkf kBMO = sup\nf \u2212 fB d\u03bc < \u221e.\nB \u03bc(B) B\nThe dual of H 1 (M ) may be identified with BM O.\nThere are several characterisations of the space H 1 (Rn ). We shall make use of\nthe so-called maximal characterisation, which we briefly recall. Suppose that m is\nan integer with m > n, and denote by Am the set of all functions \u03c6 in the Schwartz\nspace S(Rn ) such that\nsup sup (1 + |x|)m D\u03b2 \u03c6(x) \u2264 1,\n|\u03b2|\u2264m x\u2208Rn\n\nwhere |\u03b2| denotes the length of the multi-index \u03b2. For \u03c6 in S(Rn ) denote by \u03c6t\nthe function t\u2212n \u03c6(*/t). Given f in L1 (Rn ), define the \"grand maximal function\"\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFANO MEDA, PETER SJ\u00d6GREN, AND MARIA VALLARINO\n\nMm f by\nMm f = sup sup |\u03c6t \u2217 f | .\n\u03c6\u2208Am t>0\n\nThe following result is classical [6, 13, 7, 15].\nTheorem 2.1. Suppose that f is in L1 (Rn ). The following are equivalent:\n(i) f is in H 1 (Rn );\n(ii) the grand maximal function Mm f is in L1 (Rn ).\nFurthermore, f 7\u2192 kMm f kL1 (Rn ) is an equivalent norm on H 1 (Rn ).\nThe letter C will denote a positive constant, which need not be the same at\ndifferent occurrences. Given two positive quantities A and B, we shall mean by\nA \u223c B that there exists a constant C such that 1/C \u2264 A/B \u2264 C.\n3. The Euclidean case\nIn this section we work in the classical setting of Rn .\nTheorem 3.1. The following hold:\n1,q\n(i) if q < \u221e, then k*kH 1,q (Rn ) and k*kH 1 (Rn ) are equivalent norms on Hfin\n(Rn );\nfin\n\n1,\u221e\n(ii) the two norms k*kH 1,\u221e (Rn ) and k*kH 1 (Rn ) are equivalent on Hfin\n(Rn ) \u2229\nfin\nC(Rn ).\n1,q\nProof. Clearly, kf kH 1 (Rn ) \u2264 kf kH 1,q (Rn ) for f in Hfin\n(Rn ) and for q in (1, \u221e].\nfin\nThus, we have to show that for every q in (1, \u221e) there exists a constant C such\nthat\n1,q\nkf kH 1,q (Rn ) \u2264 C kf kH 1 (Rn )\n\u2200f \u2208 Hfin\n(Rn ),\nfin\n\n1,\u221e\nand that a similar estimate holds for q = \u221e and all f in Hfin\n(Rn ) \u2229 C(Rn ).\n1,q\nSuppose that q is in (1, \u221e], and that f is in Hfin (Rn ) with kf kH 1 (Rn ) = 1. By\nthe translation invariance of Lebesgue measure, we may assume that the support of\nf is contained in the closed ball B = B(0, R) centred at 0 with radius R. For each\nk in Z, denote by \u03a9k the level set {x \u2208 Rn : Mm f (x) > 2k } of the grand maximal\nk\nfunction Mm f of\nS f . kWe choose Whitney cubes Qi , i \u2208 N, with disjoint interiors\nsatisfying \u03a9k = i Qi and\n\n(3.1)\n\ndiam(Qki ) \u2264 \u03b7 dist(Qki , \u03a9ck ) \u2264 4 diam(Qki ),\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a suitable constant in (0, 1). Except for the factor \u03b7, this is Theorem\nVI.1 of [14, p. 167]. The only modification needed in the proof in [14] concerns the\nchoice of the constant denoted c.\nBy following closely the proof of [15, Theorem III.2 p. 107] or [13, Theorem 3.5 pp. 1218], we produce an atomic decomposition of f of the form\nX\n(3.2)\nf=\n\u03bbki aki ,\ni,k\n\nsuch that the following hold:\n(a) \u03bbki aki \u2264 C 2k for every k in Z;\n(b) for each k in Z, the atoms aki are supported in balls Bik concentric with the\nQki and contained in \u03a9k . By choosing the constant \u03b7 in (3.1) small enough,\ndepending on the dimension, we can also ensure that the family {Bik }i has\nthe bounded overlap property, uniformly with respect to k;\n\n\fON THE H 1 \u2013L1 BOUNDEDNESS OF OPERATORS\n\n5\n\nP\n(c) there exists a constant C independent of f such that i,k \u03bbki \u2264 C kf kH 1 (Rn ) =\nC.\nWe write 2B for the closed ball concentric with B whose radius is twice as large.\nFor \u03c6 in Am and x in Rn \\ (2B) one then has\n|\u03c6t \u2217 f (x)| \u2264 t\u2212n sup |\u03c6(y/t)| kf kL1 (Rn )\ny\u2208B c\n\n\u2264t\n\n\u2212n\n\n(1 + R/t)\u2212m kf kL1(Rn )\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R+ ,\n\nso that\nMm f (x) = sup sup |\u03c6t \u2217 f (x)| \u2264 R\u2212n ,\n\u03c6\u2208Am t>R\n\nsince m > n. Now, if x is in \u03a9k \\ (2B), the above inequality and the definition of\n\u03a9k force 2k < R\u2212n ; denote by k \u2032 the largest integer k such that 2k < R\u2212n . Then\n\u03a9k is contained in 2B for k > k \u2032 .\nNext we define the functions h and l by\nXX\nXX\n\u03bbki aki .\n\u03bbki aki\nand\nl=\n(3.3)\nh=\nk\u2264k\u2032\n\ni\n\nk>k\u2032\n\ni\n\nP\nObserve that both these series converge in L1 (Rn ), simply because i,k \u03bbki < \u221e,\nso that h and l have integral 0. Clearly, f = h + l. Furthermore, the support of l\nis contained in 2B, because it is contained in \u03a9k by (b) above, and \u03a9k is contained\nin 2B for all k > k \u2032 . Therefore h = f = 0 in (2B)c .\nTo estimate the size of h in 2B, we use (a) above and the bounded overlap\nproperty of (b), getting\nX\n\u2032\n|h| \u2264 C\n2k \u2264 C2k \u2264 C |2B|\u22121 .\nk\u2264k\u2032\n\nThis proves that h/C is a (1, \u221e)-atom, where C is independent of f .\nNow we assume that q < \u221e, and conclude the proof of (i). Observe that l is in\nq\nn\nLq (Rn ), because l = f \u2212 h, P\nand both\nP f and h are in L (R ).\nWe claim that the series k>k\u2032 i \u03bbki aki converges to l in Lq (Rn ).\nP\nP\nFixing s in Z, we shall estimate k>k\u2032 i \u03bbki aki in \u03a9s \\ \u03a9s+1 .

Note that Mm f is in Lq (Rn ), since f is.\nThis implies that the series defining l converges almost everywhere, and the limit\n1\nmust coincide with\nl. The Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem\nP limit\nP the L\nnow implies that k>k\u2032 i \u03bbki aki converges to l in Lq (Rn ), and the claim is proved.\nFinally, for each positive integer N we denote by FN the finite set of all pairs\nof integers (i, k) such that k > k \u2032 and |i| + |k| \u2264 N , and by lN the function\nP\n1,q\nk k\nn\n(i,k)\u2208FN \u03bbi ai . The function lN is in Hfin (R ), and f = h + lN + (l \u2212 lN ).\nObserve that l \u2212 lN will be a small multiple of a (1, q)-atom for large N . Indeed,\n\n\f6\n\nSTEFANO MEDA, PETER SJ\u00d6GREN, AND MARIA VALLARINO\n\nby taking N large enough, we can make the corresponding coefficient less than any\ngiven \u03b5 in R+ .

Assume that f is a continuous function in\n1,\u221e\nHfin\n(Rn ). A careful examination of the proof of [15, Theorem III.2 pp. 1078] or [13, Theorem 3.5 pp. 12-18] shows that the atoms aki that appear in the\ndecomposition (3.2) are then continuous. Furthermore, we see that for each k and\ni the function \u03bbki aki depends only on the restriction of f to a ball B\u0303ik which is a\nconcentric enlargement of the ball Bik from (b) above, by a fixed scaling factor. It\nis straightforward to check that if f is constant in B\u0303ik , then \u03bbki aki = 0, and that\nthere exists an absolute constant C such that if |f | < \u03b5 in B\u0303ik , then \u03bbki aki < C \u03b5.\nSince trivially Mm f \u2264 Cn kf k\u221e where the constant Cn depends only on n, the\nlevel set \u03a9k is empty for all k such that 2k \u2265 Cn kf k\u221e . We denote by k \u2032\u2032 the largest\ninteger for which the last inequality does not hold. Then the index k in the sum\ndefining l in (3.3) will run only over k \u2032 < k \u2264 k \u2032\u2032 .\nLet \u03b5 be positive. Since f is uniformly continuous, there exists a positive \u03b4 such\nthat |x \u2212 y| < \u03b4 implies\nf (x) \u2212 f (y) < \u03b5.\nWrite l = l\u03b51 + l\u03b52 with\nl\u03b51 =\n\nX\n\n\u03bbki aki\n\nand\n\n(i,k)\u2208F1\n\nl\u03b52 =\n\nX\n\n\u03bbki aki ,\n\n(i,k)\u2208F2\n\nwhere F1 = {(i, k) : diam(B\u0303ik ) \u2265 \u03b4, k \u2032 < k \u2264 k \u2032\u2032 } and F2 = {(i, k) : diam(B\u0303ik ) <\n\u03b4, k \u2032 < k \u2264 k \u2032\u2032 }. Since F1 is a finite set, l\u03b51 is continuous.\nTo estimate l\u03b52 , we denote by xki the centre of the ball Bik and write for (i, k) in\nF2\nf (x) = f (xki ) + f (x) \u2212 f (xki ).\nThen \u03bbki aki < C \u03b5, because f (x) \u2212 f (xki ) < \u03b5 for x in B\u0303ik . For fixed k the balls\n{Bik }i have uniformly bounded overlap, so there exists an absolute constant C such\nthat\nX\n|l\u03b52 | \u2264 C\n\u03b5 \u2264 C (k \u2032\u2032 \u2212 k \u2032 ) \u03b5.\nk\u2032 <k\u2264k\u2032\u2032\n\nSince \u03b5 is arbitrary, we can thus split l into a continuous part and a part that is\nuniformly arbitarily small. It follows that l is continuous. But then h = f \u2212 l is\nalso continuous, so that h is a continuous (1, \u221e)-atom, multiplied by a factor C.\nTo find a finite atomic decomposion of l, we use again the splitting l = l\u03b51 + l\u03b52 .\nClearly l\u03b51 is for each \u03b5 a finite linear combination of continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms, and\nthe l1 norm of the coefficients is controlled by kf kH 1 , in view of (c). Observe\nthat l\u03b52 = l \u2212 l\u03b51 is continuous. Further, l\u03b52 is supported in 2B, has integral 0 and\nsatisfies |l\u03b52 | \u2264 C(k \u2032\u2032 \u2212 k \u2032 )\u03b5. Choosing \u03b5, we can thus make l\u03b52 into an arbitrarily\nsmall multiple of a continuous (1, \u221e)-atom.\n\n\fON THE H 1 \u2013L1 BOUNDEDNESS OF OPERATORS\n\n7\n\nTo sum up, f = h + l\u03b51 + l\u03b52 gives the desired finite atomic decomposition of f ,\nwith coefficients controlled by kf kH 1 .\nWe have completed the proof of (ii) and that of the theorem.\n\u0003\n1,\u221e\nRemark 3.2. Theorem 3.1 (ii) implies that any function f in Hfin\n(Rn ) \u2229 C(Rn )\nadmits a finite decomposition in (1, \u221e)-atoms such that the sum of the corresponding coefficients is \u2264 C kf kH 1 (Rn ) . Actually, the proof of Theorem 3.1 (ii) shows\nthat we can construct this finite decomposition in such a way that it involves only\ncontinuous (1, \u221e)-atoms.\n\nRemark 3.3. Theorem 3.1 extends to H p (Rn ) with 0 < p < 1 and (p, q)-atoms,\nwhere one can now have 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e. The proof is rather similar to the one given\nabove, so we only describe briefly the modifications needed for part (i). Let thus\np,q\n1 \u2264 q < \u221e. Given f \u2208 Hfin\n(Rn ) supported in a ball BR , the first step is the\n\u2212n/p\ninequality Mm f \u2264 CR\nkf kH p (Rn ) , valid outside a larger ball BCR . One proves\nthis by comparing the values of Mm f at different points and using thePfact that\nkMm f kLp(Rn ) \u223c kf kH p (Rn ) . Then the \u03a9k and the decompositions f =\n\u03bbki aki =\n\u2032\nh + l are introduced as above. The sum l now converges in S and is dominated by\nMm f . If q > 1, we have Mm f \u2208 Lq (Rn ) and\nas before that l converges\nP conclude\nP\nin Lq (Rn ). For q = 1, the tail sum S\u03ba = k\u2265\u03ba i \u03bbki aki tends to 0 in L1 (Rn ) as\n\u03ba \u2192 +\u221e, because S\u03ba is nonzero only in \u03a9\u03ba and not larger than |f | + C2\u03ba there,\nand |\u03a9\u03ba | = o(2\u2212\u03ba ) as \u03ba \u2192 +\u221e. The rest of the proof goes as before. See also [9,\nTheorem 5.6]\nCorollary 3.4. Suppose that Y is a Banach space and that one of the following\nholds:\n1,q\n(i) q is in (1, \u221e) and T : Hfin\n(Rn ) \u2192 Y is a linear operator such that\nA := sup{kT akY : a is a (1, q)-atom} < \u221e;\n(ii) T is a Y -valued linear operator defined on continuous (1, \u221e)-atoms such\nthat\nA := sup{kT akY : a is a continuous (1, \u221e)-atom} < \u221e.\nThen there exists a unique bounded linear operator Te from H 1 (Rn ) to Y which\nextends T .\nP\n1,q\nProof. We consider the case (i). Suppose that f is in Hfin\n(Rn ), f = N\nj=1 \u03bbj aj\nsay, where aj are (1, q)-atoms.

The statement of Corollary 3.4 (i) becomes false if we replace q by\n\u221e. A counterexample is given by the operator B defined in the Introduction. Note\nalso that Corollary 3.4 applies to linear functionals.\n4. Results on spaces of homogeneous type\nIn this section, we work in a space of homogeneous type (M, \u03c1, \u03bc). Recall that\nwe assume that \u03bc is \u03c3-finite, and that \u03bc(M ) is infinite.\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose that q is in (1, \u221e) and that T is a linear operator defined\n1,q\non Hfin\n(M ) with the property that\nA := sup{kT akL1 (M) : a is a (1, q)-atom} < \u221e.\nThen there exists a unique bounded linear operator Te from H 1 (M ) to L1 (M ) which\nextends T .\nProof. We prove the result in the case where q = 2. The proof in the other cases is\nsimilar.\nSuppose that B is a ball. For each f in L20 (B) such that kf kL2 (M) = 1, the\nfunction \u03bc(B)\u22121/2 f is a (1, 2)-atom, so that\nkT fkL1 (M) \u2264 A \u03bc(B)1/2\n\n\u2200f \u2208 L20 (B)\n\nby the assumption. In particular, the restriction of T to Xk2 is bounded from Xk2\nto L1 (M ) for each k. Thus, T is bounded from X 2 to L1 (M ). It follows that T \u2217 is\nbounded from L\u221e (M ) to the dual of X 2 . But the dual of X 2 is the quotient space\nL2loc (M )/C, since that of L2c,0 (Bk ) is L2 (Bk )/C.

Suppose that T is a bounded\n1,2\nlinear operator on L2 (M ). Then T is automatically defined on Hfin\n(M ). Assume\nthat\nA := sup{kT akL1 (M) : a is a (1, 2)-atom} < \u221e.\n1,2\nBy the previous result, the restriction of T to Hfin\n(M ) has a unique extension to\na bounded linear operator Te from H 1 (M ) to L1 (M ). The question is whether the\noperators T and Te are consistent, i.e., whether they coincide on the intersection\nH 1 (M ) \u2229 L2 (M ) of their domains. The answer to this question is in the affirmative\nas the following proposition shows.\n\nProposition 4.2. Suppose that T is bounded on L2 (M ) and that\nA := sup{kT akL1 (M) : a is a (1, 2)-atom} < \u221e.\nDenote by Te the unique continuous linear extension of the restriction of T to\n1,2\nHfin\n(M ) to an operator from H 1 (M ) to L1 (M ). Then the operators T and Te agree\non H 1 (M ) \u2229 L2 (M ).\nProof. Suppose that f is in L2 (M ) \u2229 L\u221e (M ) and that g is in L2c,0 (M ).

Thus the above scalar\n\u2217\nproduct g, (Te) f (with respect to the duality between H 1 (M ) and BM O(M ))\nR\nmay be written as M g (Te)\u2217 f d\u03bc.
