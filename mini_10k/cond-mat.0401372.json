In spite of the simplicity of the rules of the game, it presents a very rich behavior and interesting\nproperties.\nIn this game there is a number of players (agents) that must choose, independently, one of two alternatives at each time step, splitting into two groups. The\nwinners are those who stay at the minority side in that step. As we explain\nin the next section, there are three main ingredients in the game: (i) a public history, with the information of the m previous minority sides; (ii) some\nprescriptions (strategies) to play with, and (iii) a reward system, whereby\npoints are given to winning agents and strategies. These ingredients induce an\nemergent coordination whereby the system can be more efficient (in a sense\nexplained below) than a random game. In fact, this is the main reason for the\ninterest shown by many people on the behavior of the model.\n1\n2\n\nemail: caridi@cnea.gov.ar\nemail: ceva@cnea.gov.ar\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n1 November 2018\n\n\fA recent line of research introduces modifications into the MG, designed to\napproach the behavior of the players to that of the agents in a real market.\nAgents in an economy take decisions based on heterogeneous external information available at each time, plus internal information, including their personal\npreferences. The heterogeneous external information can be either global, such\nas an aggregate variable, or local. Some of those investigations study the effect\nof changes in the external information available in the MG. The work of M.\nPaczuski et al. [4] develops a version of Kauffman's model with certain rules\nof the MG. Other works introduce versions of the MG with local information.\nBetween these, that of Kalinowski et al. [5] places the agents on a circle; every\nagent gets the previous decisions of her (m \u2212 1) neighbors (half to her right,\nhalf to her left) as an input information; together with her own decision, she\nbuilds up a history of m bits. In this form there is a local history for each\nplayer. The rest of the rules are as in the usual MG. S. Moelbert et al. [6]\nrecently introduced a local MG, where they use a local determination of the\nminority and the corresponding local histories.\nIn this work some kind of local information will be made available to a fraction\np of the N agents (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1); we will refer to them as the interacting agents.\nAs we will see, they will be able to change their original decisions, in order to\nbe in the minority of their neighborhoods.\nIn the next section we describe the model, and present the results found; in\nsection 3 some conclusions are drawn.\n\n2\n\nThe MG with interactions\n\n2.1 The model\n\nIn the MG model there are N agents, each one with s strategies distributed at\nrandom (with reposition) at the beginning of the game. The strategies assign\none output (0 or 1) for every one of the 2m possible inputs (i.e., histories). As\na result of their choices, at each step of the game the players split into two\ngroups of size N0 and N1 , such that N0 + N1 = N. Every winner agent gets\na point after each step of the game. Besides, out of all the strategies playing\nin the game, those that correctly predict the minority side of the time step t,\nobtain a reward, called a virtual point. The agents use the virtual points to\nestablish the performance of her strategies and to choose, at each step of the\ngame, the more successful one to play with.\nThe main variable considered in this model is \u03c3, the standard deviation of the\n2\n\n\fdifference (N1 \u2212 N0 )\nT\n1X\n\u03c3 =\n(N1 \u2212 N0 )2\nT t=1\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T is the number of time steps of the game. This variable measures the\nform in which the resources of all the players are used. When | N1 \u2212 N0 |\nis small, the minority group is bigger, and the agents, as a whole, receive\nmore points. Hence, smaller values of \u03c3 indicate a better use of the resources\nby the population. As mentioned above, the interest on this model is mainly\ndue to the fact that for certain values of the variables m, s, and N, the\nstandard deviation turns out to be smaller than in the case of a random game.\nThe characterization of this collective behavior generated many studies of the\nMG, with a variety of techniques: numerical simulations [1], [7]; mean-field\napproximations [8]; equivalence with spin-glass models [9]; thermal treatments\n[10]; etc.\nTo introduce local information, we need to arrange the agents in such a form\nthat it makes sense to talk about the neighborhood of every one of them.\nHence, we distribute all the players on a square lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. The positions of the pN interacting agents on the lattice are chosen\nrandomly, at the beginning of the game. At each time step the agents follow\nthe usual rules of the MG, but the interacting agents (I.A.) are given the extra\nopportunity to modify their bets, after knowing what their nearest neighbors\nI.A. will do in the same step. As they were distributed randomly, every\none of them can have between zero and four I.A. as nearest neighbors. This\nagent will try to be in the minority of the group formed by her I.A. nearest\nneighbors, plus herself. Hence, if more than half of her neighbors choose one\nside, then the I.A. will chose the other, regardless of what her best strategy\nsays; but if half of the neighbors choose each side, then the I.A. will decide in\nagreement with the prescription of her best strategy, i.e. the one with more\nvirtual points. With this rule, she can eventually choose one option that none\nof her strategies prescribe for a given history. Once all the agents have made\ntheir choice, they make their moves simultaneously. Finally, one obtains the\nminority as usual, by considering the actions of all the players. As far as the\nplayers are concerned, points are distributed with the same rule than in the\nMG, but whenever a player wins because she plays against the majority of her\nlocal neighborhood, then no points are added to her strategies.\nThe fact that the I.A. positions are chosen randomly raises the question of the\nrelevance of the actual number of links between interacting agents, l, for every\nspecific realization (i.e. for every sample), for a fixed value pN. We considered\nthis factor, and found that in this case it only has minor effects [11].\n3\n\n\f1\n\n\u03bcr\n\nMG\n\n0\n0.11\n0.25\n0.36\n0.54\n0.72\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nz\nFig. 1. Reduced variance \u03bcr as a function of z, for N =225 agents, and several values\nof p, indicated in the inset. Out of a total of 105 time steps, data was collected in\nthe last 9 \u00d7 104 steps.\n\n2.2 Results\nWe have made extensive numerical simulations, finding \u03c3 2 /N as a function of\nboth p and 2m /N. In the following we will refer to \u03bcr \u2261 \u03c3 2 /N as the reduced\nvariance, and use z \u2261 2m /N, for short. As is well known [7], the graph of \u03bcr vs\nz displays two different informational behaviors: an efficient phase for z < zc ,\nand an inefficient phase for bigger values of z. Qualitatively, zc is the greatest\nvalue of z for which the system is dominated by a period-two, maladaptive\ndynamics that is explained below.\nIn Fig.1 we can see the ensuing changes in the reduced variance, as p increases\nfrom p = 0, i.e. the MG with no interacting agents, to p = 1, when all the\nagents are interacting. For small values of p the function \u03bcr (z) has a shape\nsimilar to that of the MG case, but there is a shift to the left of its minimum,\nimplying an improved efficiency for small values of m. Moreover, the minimum\n\u03bcmin is smaller than the corresponding MG value. As p increases, the shape\nof the curve changes, and for p = 1 the reduced variance is roughly constant,\nand the efficiency is clearly worst than in the MG case.\nIn the following we will restrict ourselves to consider the first, informationally\nefficient region. We now will relate this behavior with the crowd - anticrowd\npicture [7], [12].\nThe minority game has, for m = 2, a remarkable period-two dynamics (PTD),\n4\n\n\f10\n\n100\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03bcr\n\n\u03bcr\n\n\u03bcr\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n361\n\n0.1\n\n1089\n\n0.1\n\n3721\n\n0.01\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\np\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\np\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\np\n\nFig. 2. Reduced variance \u03bcr as a function of p, for m = 2. The different values of\nthe reduced variance are calculated using \u03c3e (empty circles), the whole dispersion\n\u03c3 (filled squares), and \u03c3o (empty triangles).\n\nwhereby during the odd appearances of a given history, the resulting minority\nis random, but then in the following, even appearance, the minority is just\nthe opposite to the previous one. Moreover, if we distinguish even and odd\noccurrences of the histories, i.e. we calculate the standard deviation \u03c3e (\u03c3o ) for\nthe time steps in which the histories \u221a\noccur an even (odd) number of times, it\nturns out that \u03c3o is of the order of N/4, while \u03c3e \u226b \u03c3o . If m = 2, this is\ntrue for almost all the steps of the game; as m increases, this rule is true only\nin a (decreasing) number of steps, and when z \u2248 10 or greater, the opposite\nhappens: the 'even' minority tends to be the same than the previous, 'odd'\none. This was first observed and explained by Manuca et.al. [7], as due to the\nformation of crowds (see also [12], [13]). In a few words, this happens as follows:\nduring the first (odd) occurrence of a history, the strategies of the players have\nthe same amount of virtual points, and therefore they will pick side randomly,\nso that N0 \u2248 N1 ; thereafter, the winner strategies will get a point. During the\nsecond (even) appearance of the same history, agents having those strategies\nwill bias the outcome, choosing the same side as before. Hence, the minority\nwill be just the opposite than the previous one; on the other hand, N0 and N1\nwill be very different, so that \u03c3e \u226b \u03c3o . Now the strategies receiving virtual\npoints are those complementary to the first set; in this form all strategies have\nroughly the same amount of points, closing a 'cycle'.\nWe begin by studying the effect of the interactions on the m = 2 case; as\nwe will see, for small values of p the system still follows the PTD, but as p\nincreases the period-two regime will disappear.\nFigure 2 shows data for \u03bcr as a function of p, for N =361, 1089 and 3721 (these\nare just three representative examples of all the cases we have considered). We\ndiscarded the first 104 time steps for N = 361, and 5 104 for bigger values of\nN, and collected data along the next 105 time steps. All the results shown are\naverages over 32 independent realizations.\nEach set has three curves, \u03bcor (p), \u03bcer (p) and \u03bcr (p),corresponding to the odd,\neven and total number of appearances of the histories, respectively. It is easy\nto distinguish three regions: (i) zone 1, where \u03bcor (p) \u2248 0.25 \u226a \u03bcer (p). This is\nthe PTD region, as can be verified by the simple observation of the record\n5\n\n\fof minorities. As it is known, 0.25 is the expected value for a random set;\n(ii) zone 2, an intermediate region where \u03bcor (p) is no longer that of a random\nprocess, but still \u03bcor (p) < \u03bcer (p); and finally, (iii) zone 3, a region where the\neven and odd curves coincide and, therefore, there is no PTD present. Notice\nthat the width of the intermediate zone shrinks as N increases. For m = 2 and\nN = 3721, the 3rd zone starts at p\u2217 \u2243 0.5 (this value has only a moderate\nsize effect).\nThe behavior for small values of p can be understood as a simple extension of\nthe behavior of the MG: there is only a small number of I.A., so that they can\nreduce somewhat the value of \u03c3, but can not change the general outcome of the\ngame. It is also possible to explain in simple terms the behavior for p = 1. In\nthis case, all the players are interacting, hence each one has a neighborhood of\n4 I.A. Let us assume, for the sake of concreteness, that the minority outcome\nfor an odd appearance of a given history is M = 1; we could expect that in\nthe next (even) appearance of the same history, the majority of the players\nwill pick the same side, as the PTD indicates. With the new rules, however,\nthere is an extra opportunity for all the players. Now, most of the agents\nwill notice that their neighbors will chose '1', and therefore each one in this\ncondition will, in turn, change her bet. As a result, the majority will chose\n'0', and the minority will again be '1'; virtual points are given to the same\ngroup of strategies than before, in agreement with the previous crowd effect:\neach history will be followed always by the same answer. One consequence of\nthis behavior, is that the system will fall into a cyclic evolution, with a period\nequal to 4 (the number of histories), or smaller.\nNotice that, in general, p\u2217 is a function of z, p\u2217 (z). In the region between p\u2217\nand p = 1, the system behaves qualitatively in the same form. We found it\nappropriate to analyze the sequence of minorities of the game, {Mi }, determining the entropy rate [14] of the set. The entropy rate of n random variables\n{Xi } measures how does the entropy of the sequence growth with n. If the\nstochastic process is a stationary Markov chain, the entropy rate HT (X) can\nbe written as follows:\nHT (X) = \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi Pij log2 Pij\n\n(2)\n\ni,j\n\nIn this equation, \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , ...) is a vector whose components are the stationary probabilities of X1 , X2 , etc. P is a probability transition matrix, whose\nelements measure the probability of the transition between the states i and j,\ni.e. Pij = prob{Xn+1 = j|Xn = i}. The reason to consider here this magnitude\nis the following: if the sequence of m-histories resulting from {Mi } has a cyclic\nbehavior, the corresponding entropy rate is zero, because in this case Pij is\neither 0 or 1. In other words, HT is an efficient detector of cyclic behavior.\nFrom a physical point of view, once one knows in what kind of cycle is the\n6\n\n\f1.0\n\nL=1\nL=2\nL=3\nL=4\nL=5\nL=6\nL=7\nL=8\nL=9\nL=10\n\n0.8\n\nHT\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\np\nFig. 3.

Notice that for p < p\u2217 , and L \u2264 m the entropy rate is HT = 1, while for\np > p\u2217 and L \u2265 m the entropy rate is HT = 0.\n\nsystem, there is no uncertainty about the next time step; that is the reason\nwhy the entropy rate vanishes.\nThe set {Mi } can be studied by forming M \u2212 L + 1 'words' of length L out of\nthe sequence of M minority sides; two successive words will share L\u22121 values,\nor bits; thus for example if we want to look at words of length L = 3, and the\nsequence of minorities is represented by ...abcde... (where each letter can take\nthe values 0, 1) one word will be 'abc' and the following 'bcd', etc. [15]. We\ndetermined HT for m = 2, 5 and 8, and several values of p in the interval {0,1},\nusing word sizes L = 1 to 10 (see Fig.3). For p & p\u2217 we found that HT \u2248 0,\nindicating the presence of a cyclic evolution. In fact, a close inspection of the\nseries of minority sides shows that for p in the interval {p\u2217 , 1}, the system falls\nin a cyclic motion for a rather long number of time steps, until it suddenly\nswitches to another cycle, and so on. The contribution to the entropy rate\nfrom the transition time steps between two different cycles is very small, but\nnoticeable. As p approaches p = 1, the change of cycle becomes more and\nmore uncommon.\nTwo other aspects of the results shown in Fig.3 deserve to be emphasized. In\nthe first place, it is rather clear that the general behavior of the entropy rate\nfollows that of the reduced variance, in the sense that both show two different\n'phases', for the same values of p: one 'phase' for p \u2264 p\u2217 , and a different one\nfor p > p\u2217 . On the other hand, the entropy rate is roughly constant in the\n7\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nHT\n\nHT\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nm=5\n\nm=8\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\np\n\nFig. 4. Entropy rate as a function of p, for m = 5 and 8. We use the same symbols\nas in Fig.3. For clarity we only show results for selected values of L.\n\np-region where the system follows the PTD. Moreover, the entropy rate for\nL \u2264 m takes the value HT \u2243 1, showing that for these word sizes the minority\nset is essentially random. Indeed, it follows from the MG rules that each step\ni of the game can only be followed by one of the two possible outcomes (i.e.\neither a zero or a one); if the behavior is random, it turns out that Pij can\nonly be equal to zero (if i and j can not be connected by the MG rules) or\n1/2. On the other hand the summation over the \u03bb values in Eq.2 will be equal\nto one; therefore it follows that HT = 1 for a random set built with the MG\nrules. Following the description of Manuca et.al [7], it can be said that one\ncan not get information 'hidden' in {Mi } by using words of length L \u2264 m:\nthis will only be possible if one uses words one bit (or more) longer than m.\nFigure 4 shows results for m = 5 and 8. It can be seen that they are similar\nto those described above for m = 2, the main difference being that the value\nof p\u2217 gets smaller as m increases. Notice that for N=3721, the case with m=8\nhas z \u2243 0.07, i.e. it still belongs to the first region.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied a modification of the rules of the Minority Game, hoping to\nretain the main ideas of the model, and at the same time introducing a more\nrealistic description of the agents. This was done through the introduction\nof certain number of interacting agents, that can know the decisions of their\nnearest neighbors, before they make their choice. As a result, the efficiency\nof the system improves if the fraction p of I.A. is small, but it is worst when\nthis fraction approaches p \u2243 1. The relation of the reduced variance \u03bcr with\np, for z < zc resembles the relation of \u03bcr with m; in fact, for every value of z\nthere is an optimal value of p, p\u2217 (z), for which one has the minimum value of\n\u03bcr . Thus, for a small fraction of I.A. the system remains in the PTD regime,\nsweeping through the whole set of histories; but when this fraction is greater\n8\n\n\fthan p\u2217 (z) (but still within the first, informationally efficient region), it falls\ninto a cyclic, and in general non ergodic motion. In this sense, the use of the\nentropy rate proved to be a sensible tool to study the sequence of histories\nvisited.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Challet, Y.C.
