Although the generated field is as chaotic as\nthe seed field and does not carry any information about the modulation of the pump, an image of\nthe pump can be extracted by measuring the spatial intensity correlations between the generated\nfield and one Fourier component of the seed.\n\n1\n\n\fDuring the past twenty years, much theoretical and experimental work has been devoted\nto the study of image transfer and non-local imaging. The spatial properties of nonlinear\n\u03c7(2) interactions have been largely used for the realization of such experiments [1]. From\na quantum point of view, the generation of couples of entangled photons by spontaneous\ndownconversion has allowed, through coincidence techniques [2], to transfer spatial information from one of the twin photons to the other [3, 4, 5, 6]. The same techniques yielded\nsimilar results with a classical source of correlated single-photon pairs [7, 8]. It has been\ntheoretically shown that, also in the many photon regime, image transfer can be implemented with both quantum entangled [9] and classically correlated light [10, 11, 12]. One\nmay alternatively place the object to be imaged on the beam pumping the spontaneous\nparametric downconversion process [13]. Images have been actually detected by mapping\nsuitable photon coincidences between the generated beams [13, 14, 15]. The corresponding\nimaging configuration in the many photon regime has not been studied yet. In this Letter,\nwe propose a classical experiment whose aim is to mimic the many-photon quantum experiment. We realize a scheme of seeded parametric generation in which an image is encoded\non the pump field, E3 (object field), and the seed field, E1 , is chaotic, being obtained from\na plane wave randomized by a moving diffusing plate. We show that the generated field,\nE2 , is also chaotic and does not carry information about the image encoded on the pump.\nThis interaction somehow simulates the corresponding spontaneous process, since E1 has\nthe same chaotic statistics of the states produced by spontaneous parametric generation.\nActually, the chaotic field E2 reconstructs an incoherent superposition of images of the object generated by the plane-wave components of E1 [16, 17, 18]. Here we show that it is\npossible to recover a single image by measuring a suitable spatial intensity correlation function between the seed/reference field E1 and the generated field E2 , thus suggesting a way\nto extend quantum imaging protocols to the continuous-variable regime, with the definite\nadvantage of measuring intense signals instead of single photons.\nAs shown in Fig.1 a), the amplitude modulation UO (xO , yO ) of field E3 is obtained by\nplacing an object-mask, O, on the beam path. The lens that is located on plane (xL , yL ),\nat distance dF before the nonlinear crystal, images O into O\u2032 on plane (xI , yI ) at distance\nd = 2f \u2212 dF beyond the crystal (2f \u2212 2f system). A plane-wave seed E1 , slightly noncollinear to the pump (not shown in the figure), would generate an E2 field reconstructing\na real image of O\u2032 on plane (x2 , y2 ) at a distance s2 = (k2 /k3 )d along the E2 propagation\n2\n\n\fdirection, where kj are the wave-vector magnitudes [18]. The amplitude UF on the plane of\nthe crystal entrance face (xF , yF ) is\nUF (xF , yF ) =\n\u00d7\n\nk3 i k3 (x2F +yF2 )\ne 2d\n2\u03c0id\nZ\n\nk3 dF \u2212f\nf\n\ndxO dyO UO (xO , yO ) ei 2d\n\n(x2O +yO2 ) ei kd3 (xF xO +yF yO ) .\n\n(1)\n\nFor a non depleted pump, the field complex amplitudes a1,2,3 (L) at the crystal exit face are:\na1 (L) = a1 (0) cosh (f (\u03b8, \u03b2)|a3 (0)|L) \u2243 a1 (0)\na3 (0)\na2 (L) = igef f La\u22171 (0)\nsinh (f (\u03b8, \u03b2)|a3 (0)|L)\n|a3 (0)|\n\u2243 igef f Lf (\u03b8, \u03b2)a\u22171 (0)a3 (0)\n\n(2)\n\na3 (L) = a3 (0) = UF (xF , yF ) ,\nwhere L is the crystal thickness, f (\u03b8, \u03b2) is a function of the propagation angles (see Fig. 1\nb)), gef f is the coupling constant of the interaction and the approximations hold in the low\ngain regime [19].\nNow we consider the interaction that occurs with a chaotic E1 (r)\n\u221d\nPN\nn=1 a1,n exp (\u2212i k1,n * r) having random complex amplitudes, a1,n , and wave vectors, k1,n , with random directions but equal amplitudes, k1,n = 2\u03c0/\u03bb1 , for an ordinarily\n\npolarized seed wave. Inside the nonlinear medium, each of the spatial Fourier components\nof the seed field that is phase matched with the pump generates an a2 (L) contribution\naccording to Eq. (2). Thus N images are simultaneously generated and the overall field is\nE2 (rout ) \u221d\n\nN\nX\n\nigef f Lf (\u03b8, \u03b2)a\u22171,n (0)a3 (0)e\u2212i\n\nk2,n *rout\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nn=1\n\nin which rout \u2261 (xout , yout , L), see Fig. 1 a). Since the wave vectors k2,n are linked to k1,n and\nk3 by the phase-matching condition (k3 = k1,n + k2,n ), they have random directions, thus\nimpairing the reconstructed image hologram visibility. If we let field E2 propagate freely to\nthe plane (x2 , y2 , (k2 /k3 )d) where all N images do form for a type-I interaction of paraxial\nbeams, we can calculate the intensity on that plane, which turns out to be [18, 19]\nI2 (r2 ) \u221d |E2 (x2 , y2 , (k2 /k3 )d)|2\n=\n=\n\nN\nX\n\n2\n\ncn a1,n UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )\n\nn=1\nN\nX\n\n|cn |2 |a1,n |2 |UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )|2 ,\n\nn=1\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere the coefficients |cn |2 summarize all constant factors and the transverse translations,\nx2,n and y2,n (if refraction at the exit face of the crystal is neglected: x2,n = (k2 /k3 )d sin \u03b22,n\nand y2,n = (k2 /k3 )d cos \u03b22,n sin \u03b82,n , see Fig. 1 b)) are due to the different directions of the\nk2,n wave vectors. In the last line of Eq. (4) the intensity I2 (r2 ) has been written as the sum\nof N terms because, owing to the incoherence of the N components of E2 , all the interference\nterms vanish. The observation that each term of the sum is proportional to the intensity\nof the n-th reference field component, |a1,n |2 , provides a means to recover the image. In\nfact, by evaluating the spatial correlation function of the intensity I1,j = |a1,j |2 of a single\ncomponent of the seed with the intensity map of the generated field, I2 (x2 , y2 , z2 ), we get:\nG (I1,j , I2 ) = hI1,j I2 i \u2212 hI1,j ihI2 i\nN\nX\n2\n= h|a1,j |\n|cn |2 |a1,n |2 |UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )|2 i\nn=1\nN\nX\n\n\u2212 h|a1,j |2 ih\n\n|cn |2 |a1,n |2 |UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )|2 i\n\nn=1\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\n|cn |2 |UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )|2\n\nn=1\n\n\u00d7 h|a1,j |2 |a1,n |2 i \u2212 h|a1,j |2 ih|a1,n |2 i\n=\n=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n|cn |2 |UO (x2,n \u2212 x2 , y2,n \u2212 y2 )|2 \u03c3 2 |a1,n |2 \u03b4j,n\n\nn=1\n|cj |2\n\n\u03c3 2 (I1,j ) |UO (x2,j \u2212 x2 , y2,j \u2212 y2 )|2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere h* * * i is the ensemble average. In deriving Eq. (5) we neglected the pump fluctuations\nand used the property of chaotic light: h|a1,j |2 |a1,n |2 i \u2212 h|a1,j |2 ih|a1,n |2 i = \u03c3 2 (|a1,n |2 )\u03b4j,n ,\nin which \u03c3 2 (|a1,j |2 ) \u2261 \u03c3 2 (I1,j ) is the variance. This result shows that G (I1,j , I2 (x2 , y2 )) is\nproportional to the intensity map of the difference-frequency generated image of the object\n|UO |2 \"reconstructed\" by the j-th component of the seed field E1 . For an experimental\nproof, we have to map I2 (r2 ) and to measure I1,j , which is easily done by mapping I1 (r1 )\nin the focal plane of a lens.\nThe experimental setup is sketched in Fig. 2. The wavelengths of the interacting fields\nare \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 1064 nm, \u03bb3 = 532 nm. Pump and seed fields are obtained from a Nd:YAG\nlaser (10 Hz repetition rate, 7-ns pulse duration, Spectra-Physics). The nonlinear crystal\nis a type I \u03b2-BaB2O4 crystal (cut angle 32o , 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 4 mm, Fujian Castech\nCrystals). The detection planes of I1,j and I2 (r2 ) are made to coincide on the sensor of\n4\n\n\fthe same CCD camera (Dalsa CA-D1-256T, 16 \u03bcm \u00d7 16 \u03bcm pixel area, 12 bits resolution,\noperated in progressive scan mode), so that each signal occupies half sensor. The chaotic\nfield E1 is generated by passing the beam at \u03bb1 through a ground-glass diffusing plate, which\nis moved shot by shot, by selecting a portion of diffused light with an iris, PH, of \u223c 8 mm\ndiameter and finally by filtering the ordinary polarization with a polarizing beam splitter,\nPBS, and a half-wave plate. Lens L2 (f = 15 cm) provides the Fourier transform of E1 . To\ncheck the chaotic nature of this seed field we measured the probability distribution, Pr (I1 ),\nof the intensity recorded by the different CCD pixels for a single shot, and the probability\ndistribution, Pt (I1 ), of the intensity recorded by a single pixel for many successive laser\nshots (see Fig. 2, inset). The good agreement with thermal distributions shows that E1 is\nactually randomized in space at each shot and that any I1,j is random from shot to shot.\nThe desired imaging configuration was realized by using a copper sheet with three holes\n(\u223c 256 \u03bcm diameter) as the mask producing object O, and by recording I2 (r2 ) at the\nlaser repetition rate. The intensity correlation function in Eq. (5) was evaluated over 1000\nshots by taking the whole map I2 (x2 , y2 ) and by selecting the value of a single pixel in\nthe intensity map of I1 . In Fig. 3 a), we show the resulting reconstructed image (map of\nG (I1,j , I2 (x2 , y2 ))), to be compared with the plane-wave image obtained in single shot upon\nremoving the light diffusing plate, Fig. 3 b). The similarity in the quality of the two images\nis really impressive, in particular if the reconstructed image is compared with a single-shot\nintensity map I2 (x2 , y2 ), Fig. 3 c), and with the average intensity map hI2 (x2 , y2 )i of the\n1000 repetitions, Fig. 3 d).\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the spatial intensity correlation properties of\nthe downconversion process can be used to recover a selected image from a chaotic ensemble.\nThe image recovered by G (I1,j , I2 (x2 , y2 )) fulfils the properties of the difference-frequency\ngenerated image that would be obtained by using the single plane-wave E1,j as the seed field.\nWe expect that the method also works in the case of an unseeded process in the continuousvariable regime, in which the selection of a single spatial and temporal frequency in the\nparametric fluorescence cone should determine the position of the reconstructed image.\nThe authors thanks A.
