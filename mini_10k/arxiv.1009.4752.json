Our approach is a vertex operator algebra analogue of \"An E8 -approach to\nthe Leech lattice and the Conway group\" by Lepowsky and Meurman. Moreover, we find\nnew analogies among the moonshine vertex operator algebra, the Leech lattice and the\nextended binary Golay code.\n\nIntroduction\nThe moonshine vertex operator algebra (VOA) is one of the most important VOAs. A reason\nis that its automorphism group is isomorphic to the Monster, the largest sporadic finite simple\ngroup. Hence the Monster can be studied as symmetries of the moonshine VOA.\nThe moonshine VOA was constructed by Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman [FLM88] from the\nLeech lattice as a VOA analogue of the construction of the Leech lattice from the extended\nbinary Golay code. Hence, it is natural to regard VOAs as analogues of binary codes and\nlattices. In fact, by this approach, the upper bound of the minimum conformal weight of a\nholomorphic VOA was given in [H\u00f695], and the notion of a conformal design based on a VOA\nwas introduced in [H\u00f608]. For other example, some isomorphism problems of VOAs were solved\nin [Sh].\nLepowsky and Meurman studied the Leech lattice in [LM82] starting with the orthogonal\ndirect sum of three copies of the E8 root lattice, and described it by the quadratic space over\nF2 associated to the E8 root lattice. This is a lattice analogue of Turyn's construction of the\nextended binary Golay code (cf. [MS77]). These are useful for understanding the automorphism\n\u2217\nThe author was partially supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 20549004) and Excellent\nYoung Researcher Overseas Visit Program, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\n1\n\n\fgroups of the Golay code and the Leech lattice, the Mathieu group and the Conway group\n([CS99, LM82, Gr99]). Hence it is really important for the study of the Monster to find a VOA\nanalogue of these descriptions.\nIn this article, we study the moonshine VOA starting with the tensor product of three copies\nof the VOA V\u221a+2E , and describe it as a simple current extension of (V\u221a+2E )\u22973 by using a certain\n8\n8\nmaximal totally singular subspace of the quadratic space over F2 associated to (V\u221a+2E )\u22973 . This\n8\nis a VOA analogue of Lepowsky and Meurman's description of the Leech lattice. Note that the\nmoonshine VOA was already constructed by Miyamoto [Mi04] as a simple current extension of\n(V\u221a+2E )\u22973 without quadratic spaces.\n8\nAn advantage of our description is that we can effectively apply results of quadratic spaces\nand orthogonal groups to VOAs. The transitivity of the automorphism group of the moonshine\nVOA on the set of all full subVOAs isomorphic to (V\u221a+2E )\u22973 is proved by the uniqueness\n8\nof certain maximal totally singular subspaces of the quadratic space, and a subgroup of the\nautomorphism group of the moonshine VOA of shape 215 .(220 : (SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )) is described\nas a lift of a certain subgroup of the orthogonal group. According to [CCNPW85], a subgroup\nwith this shape is a maximal 2-local in the Monster.\nAnother advantage is that we can find some aspects of the moonshine VOA and the Monster\nanalogous to the Leech lattice and the Conway group, and to the extended binary Golay code\nand the Mathieu group respectively. For example, the transitivity in the previous paragraph\nis a VOA analogue of that of the Mathieu group on the set of all trios of the extended binary\nGolay code (cf. [CS99])\nof the Conway group on the set of all sublattices of the Leech\n\u221aand that\n\u22953\nlattice isomorphic to ( 2E8 ) ([Gr99]). Moreover,\nthe similarity of the following shapes of the\n\u221a\nstabilizers of a trio in the Mathieu group, of ( 2E8 )\u22953 in the Conway group, and of (V\u221a+2E )\u22973\n8\nin the Monster is explained by the associated orthogonal groups and quadratic spaces:\n26 : (SL3 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 ), 23 .(212 : (SL4 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )), 215 .(220 : (SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )).\nAs another example, we find the following equation for the dimension of the weight 2 subspace\nof the moonshine VOA (Proposition 4.15):\n(3 \u00d7 156) + (3 \u00d7 (25 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 82 + (3 \u00d7 (25 \u2212 1) \u00d7 28 ) \u00d7 12 \u00d7 81 = 196884,\nwhere 156 is the dimension of the weight 2 subspace of the VOA V\u221a+2E . This is a VOA analogue\n8\nof the following equations for the number of octads in the extended binary Golay code and that\nof vectors of norm 4 in the Leech lattice:\n(3 \u00d7 1) + (3 \u00d7 (23 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 22 + (3 \u00d7 (23 \u2212 1) \u00d7 24 ) \u00d7 12 \u00d7 21 =\n759,\n(3 \u00d7 240) + (3 \u00d7 (24 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 20 \u00d7 162 + (3 \u00d7 (24 \u2212 1) \u00d7 26 ) \u00d7 22 \u00d7 161 = 196560.\nLet us explain the main results. First, we discuss quadratic spaces over F2 , which is crucial\nfor this article. Let (R, q) be a non-singular quadratic space of plus type over F2 and let\nw : R \u2192 {0, 1, 2} be the map defined by setting\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20 if v = 0,\nw(a) = 1 if q(a) = 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2 if q(a) = 0 and v 6= 0.\nLet (R3 , q 3 ) be the orthogonal direct sum of three copies of (R, q) and let S be a maximal\ntotally singular subspace of (R3 , q 3 ) satisfying\nw 3 (v) \u2265 4,\n\n\u2200v \u2208 S \\ {0},\n2\n\n\fP3\nwhere w 3 (a1 , a2 , a2 ) =\ni=1 w(ai ). Such a subspace was constructed in [LM82] from complementary maximal totally singular subspaces of (R, q). We show in Theorem 2.8 that S is\nunique up to Aut(R3 , w 3), the subgroup of the orthogonal group O(R3 , q 3 ) preserving w 3, and\ndetermine in Proposition 2.5 the stabilizer of S in Aut(R3 , w 3).\nNext, we describe the moonshine VOA by the quadratic space. Let V = V\u221a+2E and let R(V )\n8\ndenote the set of all isomorphism classes of irreducible V -modules. By [AD04, ADL05], R(V )\nhas a 10-dimensional vector space structure over F2 under the fusion rules. By [Sh04], R(V ) has\na non-singular quadratic form qV of plus type, and hence (R(V ), qV ) is a 10-dimensional nonsingular quadratic space of plus type over F2 . Let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of\n(R(V )3 , qV3 ). We identify R(V )3 with R(V 3 ) ([FHL93, DMZ94]), where V 3 is the tensor product\nof three copies of V . Then by a theory of simple current extensions ([Hu96, Mi04, LY08]), the\nV 3 -module V(S) = \u2295[M ]\u2208S M has a holomorphic VOA structure, where [M] is the isomorphism\nclass of M. In this case, for [M] \u2208 R(V 3 ), the lowest weight of M is w 3 ([M])/2. Assume that\nS satisfies the condition on w 3 in the previous paragraph. Then the the weight 1 subspace of\nV(S) is trivial. Since V is framed, so is V(S). Hence by [LY07], V(S) is isomorphic to the\nmoonshine VOA (Theorem 4.10).\nFinally, we study the moonshine VOA and the automorphism group by using the orthogonal\ngroup and the quadratic space. By [Sh04], the stabilizer of S in Aut(V 3 )(\u223c\n= Aut(R(V )3 , w 3 ))\n15\n20\nlifts to a subgroup of Aut(V(S)), and its shape is 2 .(2 : (SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )). The uniqueness\nof S up to Aut(R(V )3 , w 3) implies the transitivity of Aut(V(S)) on the set of all full subVOAs\nof V(S) isomorphic to (V\u221a+2E )3 (Theorem 4.17). Moreover, we describe in Proposition 4.15 the\n8\ndimension of the weight 2 subspace in terms of quadratic spaces.\nIn order to compare VOAs to binary codes and lattices, we study the extended binary Golay\ncode and the Leech lattice by similar approaches in Section 3, which were already discussed in\n[MS77, CS99, LM82, Gr99, Gr].\nNotations\nh ,i\n(, )\n\u00d7\n2n\nA.B\nA:B\nCk\nC(S)\nE8\n\u03a6, \u03a8\n\u03a6(ij)\n\u03a8(12...k)\n(\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8)(1)\ng\u25e6M\ng \u25e6 [M ]\nLk\nL(S)\n[M ]\nO(R, q)\nO2 (G)\n\u03c1i\nq\nqC\n\nThe symplectic form on R or on Rk .\nA positive definite bilinear form on Rn or the standard inner product on Fn2 .\nThe fusion rules for a VOA.\nAn elementary abelian 2-group of order 2n .\nA group extension with normal subgroup A and quotient B.\nA split extension with normal subgroup A and quotient B.\nThe direct sum of k copies of a binary code C.\nThe binary code associated to S \u2282 R(C)k .\nThe E8 root lattice.\nMaximal totally singular subspaces of R, R(C), R(L) or R(V ).\n\u03a6(ij) = {(a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Rk | ai = aj \u2208 \u03a6, al = 0 if l 6= i, j}.\n\u03a8(12...k) = {(b, . . . , b) \u2208 Rk | b \u2208 \u03a8}.\n(\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8)(1) = {(a, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 Rk | a \u2208 \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8}.\nThe conjugate of a module M for a VOA by an automorphism g.\nThe isomorphism class of g \u25e6 M .\nThe orthogonal direct sum of k copies of a lattice L.\nThe lattice associated to S \u2282 R(L)k .\nThe isomorphism class of a module M for a VOA.\nThe orthogonal group of a quadratic space (R, q).\nThe maximal normal 2-subgroup of a group G.\nThe i-th coordinate projection from Rk to R.\nA quadratic form on R of plus type\nThe quadratic form on R(C) defined by qC (x) = wt(x)/2 (mod 2).\n\n3\n\n\fqL\nqV\nSLn (2)\nSymn\nS\nS(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)\n(R, q)\n(Rk , q k )\nR(C)\nR(L)\nR(V )\nV\nVk\nV(S)\nwk\nwt(x)\n\n1\n\nThe quadratic form on R(L) defined by qL (x) = (x, x) (mod 2).\nThe quadratic form on R(V ) defined by\nqV ([M ]) = 0, 1 if M is Z-graded, (Z + 1/2)-graded respectively.\nThe special linear group of degree n over F2 .\nThe symmetric group of degree n.\nA maximal totally singular subspace of Rk .\nThe maximal totally singular subspace of Rk\nspanned by \u03a6(1i) (2 \u2264 i \u2264 k), \u03a8(12...k) and (\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8)(1) .\nA non-singular quadratic space of plus type with q over F2 .\nThe orthogonal direct sum of k copies of (R, q).\nC \u22a5 /C, where C \u22a5 is the dual code of C.\nL\u2217 /L, where L\u2217 is the dual lattice of L.\nThe set of all isomorphism classes of irreducible modules for a VOA V .\nA simple rational C2 -cofinite self-dual VOA of CFT type, or V = V\u221a+2E .\n8\nThe tensor product of k copies of a VOA V .\nThe VOA associated to S \u2282 R(V )k .\nThe map from Rk to {0, 1, . . . , 2k} (see Section 2.1).\nThe (Hamming) weight of x = (xi ) \u2208 Fn2 defined by wt(x) = |{i | xi 6= 0}|.\n\nPreliminary\n\nIn this section, we recall or give some definitions and facts necessary in this article.\n\n1.1\n\nQuadratic spaces and orthogonal groups\n\nLet us recall fundamental facts on quadratic spaces over F2 and orthogonal groups (cf. [Ch97]).\nLet R be a 2m-dimensional vector space over F2 . A form h , i : R \u00d7 R \u2192 F2 is said to be\nsymplectic if it is a symmetric bilinear form with ha, ai = 0 for all a \u2208 R. A map q : R \u2192 F2 is\ncalled a quadratic form on R if the associated form defined by ha, bi = q(a + b) + q(a) + q(b),\na, b \u2208 R, is symplectic. A quadratic form is said to be non-singular if the associated symplectic\nform is non-singular, that is, R\u22a5 = {a \u2208 R | ha, Ri = 0} = 0. The pair (R, q) consisting of a\nvector space R over F2 and a quadratic form q on it is called a quadratic space, and it is said to\nbe non-singular if q is non-singular. A vector a \u2208 R is said to be singular (resp. non-singular)\nif q(a) = 0 (resp. q(a) = 1). A subspace \u03a6 of R is said to be totally singular if any vector in\n\u03a6 is singular. A non-singular quadratic form q is said to be of plus type if the dimension of a\nmaximal totally singular subspace of (R, q) is m. Let O(R, q) denote the orthogonal group of\n(R, q), the subgroup of GL(R) preserving q. The following lemma is well-known.\nLemma 1.1. (cf. [Ch97]) Let (R, q) be a non-singular 2m-dimensional quadratic space of plus\ntype over F2 . Let \u03a6 be a maximal totally singular subspace of R and let H be the stabilizer of\n\u03a6 in O(R, q).\n(1) The subspace of R orthogonal to \u03a6 is equal to \u03a6, that is, \u03a6\u22a5 = \u03a6.\n(2) The orthogonal group O(R, q) is transitive on the set of all maximal totally singular subspaces of R.\n(3) The maximal normal 2-subgroup O2 (H) of H acts trivially on both \u03a6 and R/\u03a6, and\nm\nH/O2 (H) acts on \u03a6 as SL(\u03a6)(\u223c\n= SLm (2)). Moreover, H has the shape 2( 2 ) : SLm (2).\n(4) There exists a maximal totally singular subspace \u03a8 of R such that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Moreover,\nthe stabilizer of \u03a8 in H is isomorphic to SLm (2).\n4\n\n\f(5) All pairs of complementary maximal totally singular subspaces of R are conjugate under\nO(R, q).\n(6) O(R, q) is transitive on the set of all non-zero singular vectors in R.\n\n1.2\n\nVertex operator algebras\n\nIn this subsection, we recall the definitions of vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and modules\nfrom [Bo86, FLM88, FHL93]. Throughout this article, all VOAs are defined over the field C of\ncomplex numbers unless otherwise stated.\nA vertex operator algebra (VOA) (V, Y, 1, \u03c9) is a Z\u22650 -graded vector space V = \u2295m\u2208Z\u22650 Vm\nequipped with a linear map\nX\nai z \u2212i\u22121 \u2208 (End(V ))[[z, z \u22121 ]], a \u2208 V,\nY (a, z) =\ni\u2208Z\n\nthe vacuum vector 1 and the Virasoro element \u03c9 satisfying a number of conditions ([Bo86,\nFLM88]). We often denote it by V or (V, Y ) simply.\nTwo VOAs (V, Y, 1, \u03c9) and (V \u2032 , Y \u2032 , 1\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ) are said to be isomorphic if there exists a linear\nisomorphism g from V to V \u2032 satisfying\ng\u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2032\n\nand gY (v, z) = Y \u2032 (gv, z)g\n\nfor \u2200v \u2208 V.\n\nWhen two VOAs are the same, such a linear isomorphism is called an automorphism. The group\nof all automorphisms of V is called the automorphism group of V and is denoted by Aut(V ).\nWe mean by a subVOA (or a vertex operator subalgebra) a graded subspace of V which has a\nstructure of a VOA such that the operations and its grading agree with the restriction of those\nof V and that they share the vacuum vector. When they share also the Virasoro element, we\nwill call it a full subVOA.\nAn (ordinary) module (M, YM ) for a VOA V is a C-graded vector space M = \u2295m\u2208C Mm\nequipped with a linear map\nX\nYM (a, z) =\nai z \u2212i\u22121 \u2208 (End(M))[[z, z \u22121 ]], a \u2208 V\ni\u2208Z\n\nsatisfying a number of conditions ([FHL93]). We often denote it by M and its isomorphism\nclass by [M]. The weight of a homogeneous vector v \u2208 Mk is k. If M is irreducible then there\nexists the lowest weight h \u2208 C of M such that M = \u2295m\u2208Z\u22650 Mh+m and Mh 6= 0.\nA VOA V is said to be of CFT type if V0 = C1, is said to be rational if any module\nis completely reducible, and is said to be C2 -cofinite if V /SpanC {a\u22122 b | a, b \u2208 V } is finitedimensional. A VOA is said to be holomorphic if it is the only irreducible module up to\nisomorphism. A module M is said to be self-dual if its contragredient module (cf. [FHL93])\nis isomorphic to itself. Let R(V ) denote the set of all isomorphism classes of irreducible V modules. Note that if V is rational then |R(V )| < \u221e.\nLet Ma , Mb , Mc be modules for a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA V . An intertwining\noperator of type Ma \u00d7 Mb \u2192 Mc is a linear map Ma 7\u2192 (Hom(Mb , Mc )){z} satisfying a number\nMc\nis the dimension of the space of all intertwining\nof conditions ([FHL93]). The fusion rule NM\na ,Mb\noperators of type Ma \u00d7 Mb \u2192 Mc . Since V is C2 -cofinite, the fusion rules are finite ([ABD04]).\nMc\u2032\nMc\n\u2032\n\u223c\n=\nN\nBy the definition of the fusion rules, NM\nMa\u2032 ,M \u2032 if Mx = Mx as V -modules for all\na ,Mb\nb\n\n5\n\n\fx = a, b, c. Hence, the fusion rules are determined by the isomorphism classes of V -modules.\nFor irreducible modules Ma and Mb , we use the following expression\nX\nM\n[Ma ] \u00d7 [Mb ] =\nNM\n[M],\na ,Mb\n[M ]\u2208R(V )\n\nwhich is also called the fusion rule.\nLet M = (M, YM ) be a module for a VOA V . For g \u2208 Aut(V ), let g \u25e6 M = (M, Yg\u25e6M )\ndenote the V -module defined by Yg\u25e6M (v, z) = YM (g \u22121v, z).\nLemma 1.2. Let M and M \u2032 be V -modules and let g \u2208 Aut(V ).\n(1) If M \u223c\n= g \u25e6 M \u2032 as V -modules.\n= M \u2032 as V -modules then g \u25e6 M \u223c\n(2) If M is (h + Z\u22650 )-graded then so is g \u25e6 M.\nProof. Let f : M \u2192 M \u2032 be an isomorphism of V -modules, that is, f YM (v, z)w = YM \u2032 (v, z)f (w)\nfor all v \u2208 V and w \u2208 M. Replacing v by g \u22121 v, we obtain f Yg\u25e6M (v, z)w = Yg\u25e6M \u2032 (v, z)f (w) for\nall v \u2208 V . Hence g \u25e6 M \u223c\n= g \u25e6 M \u2032 as V -modules, and we obtain (1).\nBy the axioms of modules, \u03c91 acts by m on Mm . Hence (2) follows from g \u22121 (\u03c9) = \u03c9.\nIf M is irreducible then so is g \u25e6 M. By the lemma above, Aut(V ) acts on R(V ). For\nT = {W i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s} \u2282 R(V ), let g \u25e6 T denote {g \u25e6 W i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s}.\nLemma 1.3. Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA and let Ma , Mb , Mc be V -modules.\ng\u25e6Mc\nMc\n. In particular, the action of Aut(V ) on R(V )\n= NM\nLet g \u2208 Aut(V ). Then Ng\u25e6M\na ,Mb\na ,g\u25e6Mb\npreserves the fusion rules, that is, for [Ma ], [Mb ] \u2208 R(V ),\nX\nM\n(g \u25e6 [Ma ]) \u00d7 (g \u25e6 [Mb ]) =\nNM\n(g \u25e6 [M]).\na ,Mb\n[M ]\u2208R(V )\n\nProof. By the definition of g \u25e6 Mx , for each x \u2208 {a, b, c}, there exists a non-zero linear\nisomorphism \u03bdx : g \u25e6 Mx \u2192 Mx such that \u03bdx Yg\u25e6Mx (v, z) = YMx (g \u22121v, z)\u03bdx for v \u2208 V . Let Y be\na non-zero intertwining operator of type Ma \u00d7 Mb \u2192 Mc . Then one can verify that\n(g \u25e6 Y)(v, z) = \u03bdc\u22121 Y(\u03bda v, z)\u03bdb \u2208 (Hom(g \u25e6 Mb , g \u25e6 Mc )){z}, v \u2208 g \u25e6 Ma ,\nMc\n\u2264\nis a non-zero intertwining operator of type (g \u25e6 Ma ) \u00d7 (g \u25e6 Mb ) \u2192 (g \u25e6 Mc ).

Thus NMac,Mb =\ng\u25e6Mc\nNg\u25e6Ma ,g\u25e6Mb .\n\nThe theory of tensor products of VOAs was established in [FHL93]. For a positive integer\nk, let V k denote the tensor product of k copies of V . Later, we use the following lemma.\nLemma 1.4. ([FHL93, Section 4.7], [DMZ94]) Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of\nCFT type. Then\nR(V k ) = {\u2297ki=1 Wi | Wi \u2208 R(V )},\nand for \u2297ki=1 Wi,a , \u2297ki=1 Wi,b , \u2297ki=1 Wi,c \u2208 R(V k ), the following fusion rule holds:\n\u2297ki=1 Wi,a \u00d7 \u2297ki=1 Wi,b = \u2297ki=1 (Wi,a \u00d7 Wi,b ).\n\n6\n\n\f1.3\n\nSimple current extensions of VOAs\n\nIn this subsection, we recall the notion of simple current modules and simple current extensions.\nLet V (0) be a simple VOA. An irreducible V (0)-module Ma is called a simple current\nmodule if for any irreducible V (0)-module Mb , there exists a unique irreducible V (0)-module\nMc satisfying the fusion rule [Ma ] \u00d7 [Mb ] = [Mc ]. A simple VOA V is called a simple current\nextension of V (0) graded by a finite abelian group E if V is the direct sum of non-isomorphic\nirreducible simple current V (0)-modules {V (\u03b1) | \u03b1 \u2208 E} and the fusion rule [V (\u03b1)] \u00d7 [V (\u03b2)] =\n[V (\u03b1 + \u03b2)] holds for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E. The uniqueness theorem for simple current extensions was\nproved in [DM04].\nProposition 1.5. [DM04, Proposition 4.3] Let (V, Y ) be a simple current extension of a simple\nVOA V (0). Then the VOA structure of V as a simple current extension of V (0) is uniquely\ndetermined by the V (0)-module structure of V , that is, if (V \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) has a VOA structure with\nV = V \u2032 as vector spaces and Y (v, z) = Y \u2032 (v, z) for all v \u2208 V (0) then the VOAs (V, Y ) and\n(V \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) are isomorphic.\nThe conjugates of a simple current extension by automorphisms were studied in [SY03].\nLemma 1.6. [SY03, Lemma 3.14] Let V = \u2295\u03b1\u2208E V (\u03b1) be a simple current extension of a simple\nVOA V (0) graded by a finite abelian group E. Let g be an automorphism of V (0). Then the\nV (0)-module \u2295\u03b1\u2208E g \u25e6 V (\u03b1) has a VOA structure isomorphic to V .\nLet V = \u2295\u03b1\u2208E V (\u03b1) be a simple current extension of a simple VOA V (0) graded by a finite\nabelian group E. Then the dual E \u2217 of E acts on V as an automorphism group: \u03c7 \u2208 E \u2217 acts on\nV (\u03b1) by the scalar multiplication \u03c7(\u03b1) for each \u03b1 \u2208 E. The following restriction homomorphism\nwas studied in [Sh04]:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2217\n\u03b7 : NAut(V ) (E ) \u2192 g \u2208 Aut(V (0)) g \u25e6 {[V (\u03b1)] | \u03b1 \u2208 E} = {[V (\u03b1)] | \u03b1 \u2208 E} .\n(1.1)\nProposition 1.7. [Sh04, Theorem 3.3] The map \u03b7 is surjective, and Ker \u03b7 = E \u2217 .\nLet us discuss the group structure on a subset of R(V ) under the fusion rules.\nLemma 1.8. (cf. [LY08, Corollary 1 (3)]) Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT\ntype and T a subset of R(V ). Assume that a representative of any element in T is a self-dual\nsimple current module and that T is closed under the fusion rules, that is, W \u00d7 W \u2032 = W \u2032\u2032 \u2208 T\nfor all W, W \u2032 \u2208 T . Then (T , \u00d7) is an elementary abelian 2-group.\nProof. By the assumption on T , the fusion rule \u00d7 is a binary operation on T . By the\nassumptions on V , the fusion rules are associative ([Hu05]). For any [M] \u2208 T , [M] \u00d7 [M] = [V ]\nsince [M] is self-dual. Hence [V ] \u2208 T , and clearly [V ] is the identity. Thus (T , \u00d7) is an\nelementary abelian 2-group.\nThe existence theorem for a simple VOA structure on a direct sum of non-isomorphic selfdual simple current modules was established in [Hu96, LY08]. For the definition of invariant\nbilinear forms, see [FHL93].\nProposition 1.9. ([Hu96], [LY08, Proposition 3, Theorem 2]) (cf. [Mi04]) Let V be a simple\nrational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT type and let T be a set of the isomorphism classes of nonisomorphic self-dual Z-graded simple current V -modules. Assume that for any element [M] \u2208 T\nthe invariant bilinear form on M is symmetric. Then V -module \u2295[M ]\u2208T M has a simple VOA\nstructure by extending its V -module structure if and only if T is closed under the fusion rules.\n7\n\n\f1.4\n\nVOA V\u221a+2E\n\n8\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nLet E8 denote the E8 root lattice and set 2E8 = { 2v | v \u2208 E8 }. Let V\u221a2E8 be the lattice\n\u221a\nVOA associated with 2E8 ([Bo86, FLM88]) and let V\u221a+2E be the subspace of V\u221a2E8 fixed by\n8\n\u221a\nthe automorphism of V\u221a2E8 of order 2 which is a lift of \u22121 \u2208 Aut( 2E8 ). Then V\u221a+2E is a simple\n8\n\u221a\nfull subVOA of V\u221a2E8 of CFT type, and its central charge is 8. Since 2E8 has an orthogonal\nbasis of norm 4, V\u221a+2E is a framed VOA. By [DGH98], V\u221a+2E is rational and C2 -cofinite. In this\n8\n8\nsubsection, we review the properties of V = V\u221a+2E and the set R(V ) of all isomorphism classes\n8\nof irreducible V -modules.\nIn [AD04], R(V ) was determined, and |R(V )| = 210 . Moreover, in [ADL05], the fusion rules\nof R(V ) were completely calculated and the contragredient modules of irreducible V -modules\nwere determined. In particular, any irreducible V -module is a self-dual simple current module.\nBy Lemma 1.8, R(V ) has an elementary abelian 2-group structure of order 210 under the fusion\nrules. We view R(V ) as a 10-dimensional vector space over F2 . By Lemma 1.3, Aut(V ) acts\non R(V ) as a subgroup of GL(R(V )).\nLet qV : R(V ) \u2192 F2 be the map defined by setting qV ([M]) = 1 if M is (1/2 + Z)-graded,\nand qV ([M]) = 0 if M is Z-graded. Note that for [M] \u2208 R(V ), the lowest weight of M is\nw([M])/2, where w([M]) = 0, 1 and 2 if [M] = [V ], q([M]) = 1, and q([M]) = 0 with [M] 6= [V ]\nrespectively (cf. Section 2.1). It was shown in [Sh04, Theorem 3.8] that qV is a non-singular\nquadratic form on R(V ) of plus type. By Lemma 1.2 (2), Aut(V ) preserves qV . Hence we\nobtain a group homomorphism from Aut(V ) to the orthogonal group O(R(V ), qV ). In fact, it\nis an isomorphism by [Sh04, Theorem 4.5] (cf. [Gr98]).\nSince V\u221a2E8 = V \u2295 V\u221a\u22122E is a VOA, the invariant bilinear form on the irreducible V 8\nmodule V\u221a\u22122E is symmetric ([FHL93, Proposition 5.3.6]). By Lemma 1.1 (6), for any Z-graded\n8\nirreducible V -module, the invariant bilinear form on it is also symmetric. Since the lowest\nweight space of any (Z + 1/2)-graded irreducible V -module is one-dimensional, the invariant\nform must be symmetric.\nLemma 1.10. Let V = V\u221a+2E .\n8\n\n(1) V is simple, rational, C2 -cofinite, self-dual and of CFT type.\n(2) (R(V ), qV ) is a non-singular 10-dimensional quadratic space of plus type over F2 .\n(3) For [M] \u2208 R(V ), the lowest weight of M is w([M])/2.\n(4) Aut(V ) \u223c\n= O(R(V ), qV ).\n\n(5) For any irreducible V -module, the invariant bilinear form on it is symmetric.\n\n2\n\nDirect sum of quadratic spaces\n\nLet (R, q) be a non-singular 2m-dimensional quadratic space of plus type over F2 and let k be a\npositive integer. Let Rk denote the orthogonal direct sum of k copies of R. We use the\nPstandard\nk\nk\nk\nexpression (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) for a vector in R . Let q : R \u2192 F2 , (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) 7\u2192 ki=1 q(ai ).\nThen (Rk , q k ) is a non-singular 2mk-dimensional quadratic space of plus type over F2 . Note\nthat the symmetric group Symk of degree k acts naturally on Rk as the permutation group on\nthe coordinates. Clearly, Symk \u2282 O(Rk , q k ).\nIn this section, we introduce a map w k : Rk \u2192 {0, 1, . . . , 2k} and study maximal totally\nsingular subspaces S of (Rk , q k ) such that w k (v) \u2265 4 for all v \u2208 S \\ {0}.\n8\n\n\f2.1\n\nA construction of maximal totally singular subspaces\n\nIn this subsection, we construct a maximal totally singular subspace of Rk from a pair of\nmaximal totally singular subspaces of R, which is a slight generalization of [LM82] (cf. [Gr]),\nand describe its stabilizer in O(R, q) \u2240 Symk .\nLet w : R \u2192 {0, 1, 2} be the map defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20 if a = 0,\nw(a) = 1 if q(a) = 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2 if q(a) = 0 and a 6= 0,\n\nand let\n\nw k : Rk \u2192 {0, 1, . . . , 2k},\n\n(a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) 7\u2192\nk\n\nk\nX\n\nw(ai ).\n\ni=1\n\nk\n\nSince w(a) \u2261 q(a) (mod 2) for all a \u2208 R, we have w (v) \u2261 q (v) (mod 2) for all v \u2208 Rk . Hence\nw k (v) \u2208 2Z if and only if v is singular. The following lemma is easy.\nLemma 2.1. Let v be a vector in (Rk , q k ).\n(1) w k (v) = 1 if and only if v = \u03c3(a, 0, . . . , 0) for some non-singular vector a \u2208 R and \u03c3 \u2208\nSymk .\n(2) w k (v) = 2 if and only if v = \u03c3(a, 0, . . . , 0) or v = \u03c3(b, c, 0, . . . , 0) for some non-zero singular\nvector a \u2208 R or non-singular vectors b, c \u2208 R and \u03c3 \u2208 Symk .\nLet Aut(Rk , w k ) denote the subgroup of GL(Rk ) preserving w k . Then Aut(Rk , w k ) is a\nsubgroup of O(Rk , q k ) since w k (v) \u2261 q k (v) (mod 2) for v \u2208 Rk .\nProposition 2.2. Aut(Rk , w k ) \u223c\n= O(R, q) \u2240 Symk .\nProof. Let G = Aut(Rk , w k ). Clearly, O(R, q) \u2240 Symk acts faithfully on Rk and preserves w k .\nHence O(R, q) \u2240 Symk \u2282 G.\nSet R(i) = {(a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Rk | aj = 0 if j 6= i}. By Lemma 2.1 (1),\n{v \u2208 Rk | w k (v) = 1} = {v \u2208 \u222aki=1 R(i) | q k (v) = 1}.\n\n(2.1)\n\nHence G preserves {v \u2208 \u222aki=1 R(i) | q k (v) = 1}. Moreover, by Lemma 2.1 (2) and (2.1), G also\npreserves {v \u2208 \u222aki=1 R(i) | q k (v) = 0}. Hence G preserves \u222aki=1 R(i) .\nLet a, b \u2208 R(i) with ha, bi = 1 and let g \u2208 G. If g(a) \u2208 R(j) then g(b) \u2208 R(j) since\nhR(p) , R(q) i = 0 if p 6= q. Since R is non-degenerate, for non-zero a \u2208 R, SpanF2 {b \u2208 R | hb, ai =\n1} = R. Hence G permutes {R(i) | i = 1, 2, . . . , k}. It follows from O(R(i) , q k ) \u223c\n= O(R, q) that\nG \u2282 O(R, q) \u2240 Symk .\nNow, let us construct maximal totally singular subspaces S of Rk satisfying\nw k (v) \u2265 4,\n\n\u2200v \u2208 S \\ {0}\n\n(2.2)\n\nas a natural generalization of [LM82] (cf.

[LM82, p487]) The subspace S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) of (Rk , q k ) is maximal totally\nsingular. Moreover if k \u2265 3 and \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0 then it satisfies (2.2).\n\nProof. By the definition, \u03a6(12) , \u03a6(13) , * * * , \u03a6(1k) and \u03a8(12...k) are mutually perpendicular, and\n\u03a6(1i) and \u03a8(12...k) are totally singular. Hence S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) is totally singular. Let us count the\ndimension of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k). Set U = {(a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Rk | ai \u2208 \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8} and d = dim \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8.\nThen U \u2282 S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) and dim U = kd. Set T = S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)/U. Then T = \u2295ki=2 \u03a6\u0304(1i) \u2295 \u03a8\u0304(12...k)\nas vector spaces, where \u03a8\u0304 = \u03a8/(\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8) and \u03a6\u0304 = \u03a6/(\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8). Since this is a direct sum,\ndim T = (k \u2212 1) dim \u03a6\u0304 + dim \u03a8\u0304. Hence\ndim S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) = dim T + dim U = (k \u2212 1)(m \u2212 d) + (m \u2212 d) + kd = mk.\n\nThus S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) is a maximal totally singular subspace of (Rk , q k ).\nPk\u22121\nai + b) \u2208\nAssume that k \u2265 3 and that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Let v = (a1 + b, a2 + b, . . . , ak\u22121 + b, i=1\nk\nS(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) with w (v) \u2264 2, where ai \u2208 \u03a6 and b \u2208 \u03a8. Then at least (k \u2212 2) entries are zero by\nLemma 2.1 (2). Say ai + b = 0, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2, which implies ai = b = 0 by \u03a8 \u2229 \u03a6 = 0 and k \u2265 3.\nHence v = (0, . . . , 0, ak\u22121, ak\u22121 ). Since ak\u22121 is singular and w k (v) \u2264 2, we obtain ak\u22121 = 0 by\nLemma 2.1 (2). Therefore v = 0.\nLet us describe the stabilizer of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) in Aut(Rk , w k ). Let O(R, q)k denote the normal\nsubgroup of O(R, q) \u2240 Symk isomorphic to the direct product of k copies of the orthogonal\ngroup O(R, q). For an element g \u2208 O(R, q)k , we use the expression g = (g1 , g2 , . . . , gk ), where\ngi \u2208 O(R, q). For a subgroup F of O(R, q), we denote F(ij) = {(g1 , g2 , . . . , gk ) \u2208 O(R, q)k | gi =\ngj \u2208 F, gl = 1 if l 6= i, j} and F(12...k) = {(h, . . . , h) \u2208 O(R, q)k | h \u2208 F }.\n\nProposition 2.5. Let G be the stabilizer of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k) in Aut(Rk , w k ). Let H be the stabilizer\nof \u03a6 in O(R, q) and let K be the stabilizer of \u03a8 in H. If k \u2265 3 and \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0 then G is\nm\ngenerated by O2 (H)(1i) (\u223c\n= SLm (2)) and Symk , and G has the\n= 2( 2 ) ), (2 \u2264 i \u2264 k), K(12...k) (\u223c\nm\nshape 2(k\u22121)( 2 ) : (SL (2) \u00d7 Sym ).\nm\n\nk\n\nProof. By Lemma 1.1 (3) and (4), H = O2 (H) : K. By Proposition 2.2, Aut(Rk , w k ) =\nO(R, q) \u2240 Symk .\nClearly, Symk preserves S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k). By Lemma 1.1 (3) and (2.3), O2 (H)(1i) (2 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and\nK(12...k) also preserve S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k). Hence G contains hO2 (H)(1i) , K(12...k) , Symk | 2 \u2264 i \u2264 ki.\nLet g \u2208 G. Up to Symk , we may assume g = (g1 , g2 , . . . , gk ) \u2208 O(R, q)k \u2229 G. If follows from\nk \u2265 3 that g preserves \u03a6(1i) for all i. Hence gi \u2208 H and gi \u2208 O2 (H)g1. Up to K(12...k) , we may\nassume gi \u2208 O2 (H) for all i since H = O2 (H) : K. Moreover, up to hO2 (H)(1i) | 2 \u2264 i \u2264 ki,\nwe may assume gi = 1 if i \u2265 2. Let b \u2208 \u03a8. Then g1 (b) = b + c for some c \u2208 \u03a6, and\n(b, b, . . . , b) + g(b, b, . . . , b) = (c, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k). Since \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0, we have c = 0 by (2.3),\nand g1 = 1 by Lemma 1.1 (3). Thus g \u2208 hO2 (H)(1i) , K(12...k) , Symk | 2 \u2264 i \u2264 ki.\nOne can easily see that G has the desired shape by Lemma 1.1 (3) and (4).\nLater, we need the following lemma.\n10\n\n\fLemma 2.6. Let v be a vector in S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) with w 3 (v) = 4. Assume that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Then\none of the following holds:\n(I) v = \u03c3(a, a, 0) for some a \u2208 \u03a6 \\ {0} and \u03c3 \u2208 Sym3 .\n(II) v = \u03c3(a + c, a + b + c, b + c) for some \u03c3 \u2208 Sym3 , a, b \u2208 \u03a6 and c \u2208 \u03a8 \\ {0} satisfying\nw(a + c) = 2 and w(a + b + c) = w(b + c) = 1.\nMoreover, the numbers of vectors of type (I) and (II) are 3 \u00d7 (2m \u2212 1) and 3 \u00d7 (2m \u2212 1) \u00d7 22m\u22122\nrespectively.\nProof. The first assertion follows from (2.3). The number of vectors of type (I) can be\ncalculated by |\u03a6 \\ {0}| = 2m \u2212 1. Let us count the number of vectors of type (II). Note that\nw(a + c) = 2 and w(a + b + c) = w(b + c) = 1 if and only if ha, ci = 0 and hb, ci = 1.\nClearly, there are 2m \u2212 1 choices of c \u2208 \u03a8 \\ {0}. For each c, there are 2m\u22121 choices of a since\n{u \u2208 \u03a6 | hu, ci = 0} is an (m \u2212 1)-dimensional subspace of \u03a6. Similarly, there are 2m\u22121 choices\nof b since |{u \u2208 \u03a6 | hu, ci = 1}| = 2m \u2212 2m\u22121 = 2m\u22121 . Hence the number of vectors of type (II)\nis 3 \u00d7 (2m \u2212 1) \u00d7 22m\u22122 .\n\n2.2\n\nUniqueness of maximal totally singular subspaces for k = 3\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the case k = 3, and show that any maximal totally singular\nsubspace of R3 satisfying (2.2) is conjugate to S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) with \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0 under O(R, q)3. For\nthe definition of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3), see (2.3).\nLet \u03c1i denote the i-th coordinate projection from R3 to R. For a subspace S of R3 and\ndistinct i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, we denote S (i) = {v \u2208 S | \u03c1i (v) = 0} and S (ij) = {v \u2208 S | \u03c1i (v) =\n\u03c1j (v) = 0}.\nLemma 2.7. Let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of R3 satisfying (2.2) and let i, j \u2208\n{1, 2, 3} such that i 6= j. Then the following hold:\n(1) S (ij) = 0.\n(2) \u03c1i (S) = R.\n(3) The dimension of S (i) is m.\n(4) \u03c1j (S (i) ) is a maximal totally singular subspace of R.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that i = 1 and j = 2.\nLet v = (0, 0, a) \u2208 S (12) . Then v must be 0 by (2.2), which shows (1).\nSuppose \u03c11 (S) 6= R. Then \u03c11 (S)\u22a5 6= 0. Let a \u2208 \u03c11 (S)\u22a5 \\ {0}. Then (a, 0, 0) \u2208 S \u22a5 = S by\nLemma 1.1 (1), which contradicts (1). Hence (2) holds.\nBy (2), the projection \u03c11 : S \u2192 R is surjective. It follows from dim R = 2m and dim S = 3m\nthat dim S (1) = m. Hence we have (3).\nLet v = (0, a, b) \u2208 S (1) . Since v is singular, both a and b must be singular by (2.2). Hence\n\u03c12 (S (1) ) is totally singular. By (1) and (3), dim \u03c12 (S (1) ) = m, and hence \u03c12 (S (1) ) is a maximal\ntotally singular subspace of R, which proves (4).\nRecall that Aut(R3 , w 3 ) \u223c\n= O(R, q) \u2240 Sym3 from Proposition 2.2 and that O(R, q)3 is the\nnormal subgroup of Aut(R3 , w 3) isomorphic to the direct product of three copies of O(R, q).\n\n11\n\n\fTheorem 2.8. Let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R3 , q 3 ) satisfying (2.2). Then\nS is conjugate to S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) under O(R, q)3 for some maximal totally singular subspaces \u03a6 and\n\u03a8 of (R, q) satisfying \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Moreover O(R, q)3 is transitive on the set of all maximal\ntotally singular subspaces of (R3 , q 3) satisfying (2.2).\nProof. Set \u03a6 = \u03c11 (S (3) ) and \u03a6\u2032 = \u03c12 (S (3) ). Then both \u03a6 and \u03a6\u2032 are maximal totally\nsingular subspaces of R by Lemma 2.7 (4). Up to the action of O(R, q) on the second coordinate, we may assume that \u03a6\u2032 = \u03a6 by Lemma 1.1 (2). It follows from Lemma 1.1 (3)\nthat StabO(R,q) (\u03a6\u2032 )/O2 (StabO(R,q) (\u03a6\u2032 )) \u223c\n= SLm (2) acts naturally on \u03a6\u2032 . Hence we may assume\n(3)\nthat S\n= {(a, a, 0) | a \u2208 \u03a6} up to the action of O(R, q) on the second coordinate. By\nthe same arguments on \u03c11 (S (2) ) and \u03c13 (S (2) ), we obtain S (2) = {(a, 0, a) | a \u2208 \u03a6\u2032\u2032 } for some\nmaximal totally singular subspace \u03a6\u2032\u2032 of R up to the action of O(R, q) on the third coordinate. Since S is totally singular, we have hS (3) , S (2) i = 0, equivalently, \u03a6\u2032\u2032 \u2282 \u03a6\u22a5 . By Lemmas\n1.1 (1) and 2.7 (4), \u03a6\u2032\u2032 = \u03a6. Hence we obtain two m-dimensional totally singular subspaces\n\u03a6(12) = {(a, a, 0) | a \u2208 \u03a6} and \u03a6(13) = {(a, 0, a) | a \u2208 \u03a6} of S.\nLet c \u2208 R \\ \u03a6. Then by Lemma 2.7 (2), there exist a, b \u2208 R such that v = (a, b, c) \u2208 S. It\nfollows from h\u03a6(13) , vi = 0 that hp, a + \u03a6i = hp, c + \u03a6i for all p \u2208 \u03a6. Note that {hp, *i | p \u2208\n\u03a6} = Hom(R/\u03a6, F2 ) by Lemma 1.1 (1). Hence a \u2208 c + \u03a6. Similarly, a \u2208 b + \u03a6. Hence there\nexist u \u2208 \u03a6(12) and x(c) \u2208 \u03a6 such that v + u = (x(c) + c, c, c) \u2208 S. By (2.2) x(c) is uniquely\ndetermined by c. Hence for c1 , c2 \u2208 R \\ \u03a6 with c1 + c2 \u2208\n/ \u03a6 we have x(c1 ) + x(c2 ) = x(c1 + c2 ).\nLet \u03a8 be a maximal totally singular subspace of R such that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Set T = {(x(c) +\nc, c, c) | c \u2208 \u03a8}. Then T is an m-dimensional totally singular subspace of S. Since \u03c12 (T ) =\n\u03c13 (T ) = \u03a8 is totally singular, so is \u03c11 (T ). It follows from \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0 that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03c11 (T ) = 0. By\nLemma 1.1 (5), \u03c11 (T ) is conjugate to \u03a8 under O(R, q). Hence we may assume x(c) = 0 for all\nc \u2208 \u03a8 up to the action of O(R, q) on the first coordinate. Then T = \u03a8(123) = {(c, c, c) | c \u2208 \u03a8}.\nHence S is conjugate to S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) under O(R, q)3.\nThe transitivity of O(R, q)3 follows from Lemma 1.1 (5).\n\n3\n\nApplication to binary codes and lattices\n\nIn this section, we apply the results in the previous section to binary codes and lattices. For\nthe definitions and fundamental facts on binary codes and lattices, we refer the reader to\n[MS77, CS99].\n\n3.1\n\nApplication to binary codes\n\nIn this subsection, we construct doubly even self-dual binary codes without codewords of weight\n4, which is a slight generalization of Turyn's construction of the extended binary Golay code\n(cf. [MS77, Ch 18, Section 7.4]).\nLet ( , ) be the standard inner product on Fn2 . For x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Fn2 , wt(x) = |{i |\nxi 6= 0}| is the (Hamming) weight of x. For x, y \u2208 Fn2 , the following holds:\n1\n(x, y) \u2261 (wt(x + y) \u2212 wt(x) \u2212 wt(y)) (mod 2).\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nA subset of Fn2 is called a binary (linear) code of length n if it is a subspace. Let C \u22a5 denote the\ndual code of a binary code C of length n, that is, C \u22a5 = {c \u2208 Fn2 | (c, C) = 0}. A binary code\nC is said to be doubly even if wt(c) \u2208 4Z for all c \u2208 C, and is said to be self-dual if C = C \u22a5 .\nWe now consider the following condition on C \u22a5 :\nwt(c) \u2208 2Z \u2200c \u2208 C \u22a5 .\n12\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fNote that C \u22a5 satisfies (3.2) if and only if C contains the all-one codeword 1n .\nLet C be a doubly even binary code of length n \u2208 8Z satisfying (3.2). Set R(C) = C \u22a5 /C\nand let\n\u03c6C : C \u22a5 \u2192 R(C), c 7\u2192 c + C\nbe the canonical map. Then R(C) \u223c\n= (Z/2Z)m for some m \u2208 Z\u22650 and we view it as a vector\nspace over F2 . Note that dim C = (n \u2212 m)/2. Let h , i be the symmetric bilinear form on R(C)\ndefined by hc + C, d + Ci = (c, d). By (3.2) and (C \u22a5 )\u22a5 = C, it is a non-singular symplectic\nform. Consider the map\nqC : R(C) \u2192 F2 ,\n\nx + C 7\u2192 wt(x)/2\n\n(mod 2).\n\nIt follows from wt(c) \u2208 4Z for all c \u2208 C, (C, C \u22a5 ) = 0 and (3.1) that qC is a well-defined\nquadratic form on R(C) associated to the symplectic form h , i. Since n \u2208 8Z, the type of qC\nis plus. Thus (R(C), qC ) is a non-singular m-dimensional quadratic space of plus type over F2 .\nLet S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(C)k , qCk ). Let C(S) be the inverse image\nof S with respect to the canonical map\n\u03c6kC : (C \u22a5 )k \u2192 R(C)k ,\n\n(ci ) 7\u2192 (\u03c6C (ci )),\n\nthat is,\nC(S) = (\u03c6kC )\u22121 (S).\nThen C(S) is a binary code of length nk. Note that Ker \u03c6kC = C k , where C k is the direct sum\nof k copies of C, and that dim Ker \u03c6kC = (n \u2212 m)k/2.\nTheorem 3.1. Let C be a doubly even binary code of length n \u2208 8Z satisfying (3.2) and let S\nbe a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(C)k , qCk ).\n(1) The binary code C(S) of length nk is doubly even and self-dual.\n(2) Assume that S satisfies (2.2). If C has no codewords of weight 4 then so does C(S).\nProof. Since S is totally singular, C(S) is doubly even. It follows from the maximality of S\nthat dim S = mk/2. Hence\ndim C(S) = dim Ker \u03c6kC + dim S = k(n \u2212 m)/2 + mk/2 = kn/2,\nwhich shows that C(S) is self-dual.\nBy the definition of the map w : R(C) \u2192 {0, 1, 2} (cf. Section 2.1), the minimum weight\nof c + C \u2208 R(C) is greater than or equal to 2w(c + C). Hence for u \u2208 R(C)k the minimum\nweight of (\u03c6kC )\u22121 (u) is greater than or equal to 2w k (u). Thus (2) follows from (2.2) and the\nassumption on C.\nRemark 3.2. In general, the minimum weight of c + C \u2208 R(C) may not be equal to 2w(c + C).\nRemark 3.3. Let C be a doubly even binary code of length n \u2208 8Z satisfying (3.2). Let A and\nB be doubly even self-dual binary codes of length n satisfying A \u2229 B \u2283 C. Then \u03a6 = \u03c6C (A)\nand \u03a8 = \u03c6C (B) are maximal totally singular subspaces of R(C). By (2.3) C(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)) is\ndescribed in terms of A and B as follows:\nC(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)) = {(a1 + b, a2 + b, . . . , ak + b) \u2208 Fnk\n2 | ai \u2208 A, b \u2208 B,\n13\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nai \u2208 A \u2229 B}.\n\n\f3.2\n\nTuryn's construction of the extended binary Golay code\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the case where k = 3 and C = SpanF2 {18 }, and describe the\nextended binary Golay code of length 24. Moreover, as an application of Section 2.2, we study\nthe extended binary Golay code and the Mathieu group. We continue the notation of the\nprevious subsection.\nObviously, C has no codewords of weight 4 and satisfies (3.2). Let S be a maximal totally\nsingular subspace of (R(C)3 , qC3 ) satisfying (2.2). Note that such a subspace exists by Proposition 2.4. By Theorem 3.1, C(S) is a doubly even self-dual binary code of length 24 without\ncodewords of weight 4. It is well-known that such a binary code is equivalent to the extended\nbinary Golay code of length 24 (cf. [MS77]).\nCorollary 3.4. Let C = SpanF2 {18 } and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of\n(R(C)3 , qC3 ) satisfying (2.2). Then C(S) is equivalent to the extended binary Golay code of\nlength 24.\nRemark 3.5. Let \u03a6 and \u03a8 be maximal totally singular subspaces of (R(C), qC ) satisfying\n\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Then C(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3)) is isomorphic to the extended binary Golay code, which is\n\u22121\ncalled Turyn's construction (cf. [MS77, Ch 18, Theorem 12]). Note that \u03c6\u22121\nC (\u03a6) and \u03c6C (\u03a8)\nare isomorphic to the extended Hamming code of length 8.\nSince Aut(C \u22a5 ) = Aut(C), there is a canonical homomorphism of groups\n\u03c8C : Aut(C \u22a5 ) \u2192 O(R(C), qC ).\nThe injectivity is clear, and the surjectivity follows from Aut(C) = Sym8 \u223c\n= O(R(C), qC ).\nHence \u03c8C is an isomorphism of groups.\nA subcode of C(S) is called a trio if it is equivalent to C 3 = C \u2295 C \u2295 C. Since Aut(C 3 ) \u223c\n=\nAut(C) \u2240 Sym3 and Aut(C 3 ) = Aut((C \u22a5 )3 ), \u03c8C induces the injective homomorphism of groups\n\u03c8C3 : Aut((C \u22a5 )3 ) \u2192 Aut(R(C)3 , w 3).\nBy Proposition 2.2, \u03c8C3 is an isomorphism. Note that \u03c8C3 is compatible with \u03c63C , that is,\n\u03c63C (g(c)) = \u03c8C3 (g)(\u03c63C (c)) for g \u2208 Aut((C \u22a5 )3 ) and c \u2208 (C \u22a5 )3 .\nAs corollaries of Proposition 2.5 and Theorem 2.8, we obtain the following well-known\nproperties of Aut(C(S)).\nCorollary 3.6. (cf. [CS99]) Let C = SpanF2 {18 } and let S be a maximal totally singular\nsubspace of (R(C)3 , qC3 ) satisfying (2.2). Let G be the stabilizer of C 3 in the automorphism\ngroup of C(S).\n(1) The automorphism group of C(S) is transitive on the set of all trios of C(S).\n(2) G is isomorphic to the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(C)3 , w 3 ), and it has the shape 26 : (SL3 (2)\u00d7\nSym3 ).\nProof. Let D be a trio of C(S). It suffices to show that there is an automorphism of C(S)\nwhich sends D to C 3 . Let g \u2208 Sym24 such that g(D) = C 3 . Since g(C(S)) is a doubly even\nself-dual binary code without codewords of weight 4, its image \u03c63C (g(C(S))) is a maximal totally\nsingular subspace of R(C)3 satisfying (2.2). Then by Theorem 2.8, there exists h \u2208 Aut(C 3 )(\u223c\n=\n3\n3\n3\n3\nAut(R(C) , w )) such that h(C ) = C and h(g(C(S))) = C(S), which proves (1).\nClearly, G is equal to the stabilizer of C(S) in Aut((C \u22a5 )3 ). Since \u03c8C3 is compatible with \u03c63C\nand \u03c63C (C(S)) = S, \u03c8C3 (G) is the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(C)3 , w 3 ). Since \u03c8C3 is an isomorphism,\n14\n\n\fG is isomorphic to the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(C)3 , w 3 ). Moreover, G is isomorphic to the\nstabilizer of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) in Aut(R(C)3 , w 3) by (1). Hence we obtain (2) by Proposition 2.5.\nLet us count the number of codewords of weight 8 in C(S). The following lemma is easy.\nLemma 3.7. Let u \u2208 R(C).\n(1) If w(u) = 0 then the number of codewords of weight 8 in \u03c6\u22121\nC (u) is 1.\n(2) If w(u) = 1 then the number of codewords of weight 2 in \u03c6\u22121\nC (u) is 1.\n(3) If w(u) = 2 then the number of codewords of weight 4 in \u03c6\u22121\nC (u) is 2.\nProposition 3.8. Let C = SpanF2 {18 } and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of\n(R(C)3 , qC3 ) satisfying (2.2). Then the number of codewords of weight 8 in C(S) is 759.\nProof. By Theorem 2.8 and the surjectivity of \u03c8C3 , we may assume that S = S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3).\nAny codeword of weight 8 in C(S) belongs to (\u03c63C )\u22121 (0) or (\u03c63C )\u22121 (u) for some u \u2208 R(C)3 with\nw 3 (u) = 4. Note that (\u03c63C )\u22121 (0) = C 3 . Hence by Lemmas 2.6 and 3.7, the number of codewords\nof weight 8 in C(S) is\n(3 \u00d7 1) + (3 \u00d7 (23 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 22 + (3 \u00d7 (23 \u2212 1) \u00d7 24 ) \u00d7 12 \u00d7 21 = 759.\n\n3.3\n\nApplication to lattices\n\nIn this subsection, we construct even unimodular lattices without vectors of norm 2, which was\nstudied by Griess [Gr].\nLet ( , ) be a positive definite symmetric bilinear form on Rn . For x \u2208 Rn , (x, x) is the\n(squared) norm of x. For x, y \u2208 Rn , the following holds:\n2(x, y) = (x + y, x + y) \u2212 (x, x) \u2212 (y, y).\n\n(3.3)\n\nA subset L of Rn is called a lattice of rank n if L has a basis e1 , e2 , . . . , en of Rn satisfying\nL = \u2295ni=1 Zei . Let L\u2217 denote the dual lattice of a lattice L of rank n, that is, L\u2217 = {v \u2208 Rn |\n(v, L) \u2282 Z}. A lattice L is said to be even if (v, v) \u2208 2Z for all v \u2208 L, and is said to be\nunimodular if L = L\u2217 .

If L \u221a\n\u2283 2J for some even unimodular lattice J then L\u2217 \u2282 J/ 2.

Set R(L) = L\u2217 /L and let\n\u03c6L : L\u2217 \u2192 R(L),\n\nv 7\u2192 v + L\n\nbe the canonical map. Then by Lemma 3.9 (2), R(L) \u223c\n= (Z/2Z)m for some m \u2208 Z\u22650 and we\nview it as a vector space over F2 . Note that the determinant of L is 2m/2 . Let h , i be the\nsymmetric bilinear form on R(L) defined by hv + L, u + Li = 2(v, u) (mod 2). By (3.4) and\n(L\u2217 )\u2217 = L, it is a non-singular symplectic form. Consider the map\nqL : R(L) \u2192 F2 ,\n\nv + L 7\u2192 (v, v) (mod 2).\n\nIt follows from (v, v) \u2208 2Z for all v \u2208 L, (L, L\u2217 ) \u2282 Z and (3.3) that qL is a well-defined\nquadratic form on R(L) associated to h , i. Since n \u2208 8Z, the type of qL is plus (cf. [Ve79]).\nThus (R(L), qL ) is a non-singular m-dimensional quadratic space of plus type over F2 .\nLet S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(L)k , qLk ). Let L(S) be the inverse image\nof S with respect to the canonical map\n\u03c6kL : (L\u2217 )k \u2192 R(L)k ,\n\n(vi ) 7\u2192 (\u03c6L (vi )),\n\nthat is\nL(S) = (\u03c6kL )\u22121 (S).\nThen L(S) is a lattice, and its rank is nk since it contains Lk , where Lk is the orthogonal direct\nsum of k copies of L.\nTheorem 3.10. (cf. [Gr]) Let L be an even lattice satisfying (3.4) and let S be a maximal\ntotally singular subspace of (R(L)k , qLk ).\n(1) The lattice L(S) of rank nk is even and unimodular.\n(2) Assume that S satisfies (2.2). If L has no vectors of norm 2 then so does L(S).\nProof. Since S is totally singular, L(S) is even. By the maximality of S, we have dim S =\nmk/2. Hence the determinant of LL (S) is 2mk/2\u2212mk/2 = 1, which shows that L(S) is unimodular.\nBy the definition of the map w : R(L) \u2192 {0, 1, 2}, the minimum norm of v + L \u2208 R(L) is\ngreater than or equal to w(v + L). Hence for u \u2208 R(L)k the minimum norm of (\u03c6kL )\u22121 (u) is\ngreater than or equal to w k (u). Thus (2) follows from (2.2) and the assumption on L.\nRemark 3.11. In general, the minimum norm of \u03bb + L \u2208 R(L) may not be equal to w(\u03bb + L).\nRemark 3.12. Let L be an even lattice of rank n \u2208 8Z satisfying (3.4). Let J and K be even\nunimodular lattices of rank n satisfying J \u2229 K \u2283 L. Then \u03a6 = \u03c6L (J) and \u03a8 = \u03c6L (K) are\nmaximal totally singular subspaces of R(L). By (2.3) L(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)) is described in terms of J\nand K as follows:\nL(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)) = {(a1 + b, a2 + b, . . . , ak + b) \u2208 R\n\nnk\n\n| ai \u2208 J, b \u2208 K,\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nai \u2208 J \u2229 K}.\n\nNote 3.13. In [Gr], L(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; k)) was constructed and its minimum norm was studied.\n\n16\n\n\f3.4\n\nLepowsky and Meurman's description of the Leech lattice\n\nLet E\n\u221a8 denote the E8 root lattice. In this subsection, we consider the case where k = 3 and\nL = 2E8 , and describe the Leech lattice. Moreover, as an application of Section 2.2, we study\nthe Leech lattice and the Conway group. Note that the method in this subsection was already\nconsidered in [LM82, Gr99]. We continue the notation of the previous subsection.\nSince E8 is even, L has no vectors of norm 2. By Lemma 3.9 (1), L satisfies (3.4). Let S be\na maximal totally singular subspace of (R(L)3 , qL3 ) satisfying (2.2). Note that such a subspace\nexists by Proposition 2.4. By Theorem 3.10, L(S) is an even unimodular lattice of rank 24\nwithout vectors of norm 2. It was shown in [Co69] that such a lattice is isomorphic to the Leech\nlattice.\n\u221a\nCorollary 3.14. Let L = 2E8 and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(L)3 , qL3 )\nsatisfying (2.2). Then L(S) is isomorphic to the Leech lattice.\nRemark 3.15. Let \u03a6 and \u03a8 be maximal totally singular subspaces of (R(L), qL ) satisfying\n\u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = 0. Then L(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3)) is isomorphic to the Leech lattice, which was shown in [LM82,\n\u22121\nCorollary 2.3]). Note that \u03c6\u22121\nL (\u03a6) and \u03c6L (\u03a8) are isomorphic to the E8 root lattice.\nSince Aut(L\u2217 ) = Aut(L), there is a canonical homomorphism of groups\n\u03c8L : Aut(L\u2217 ) \u2192 O(R(L), qL ).\nMoreover, the center Z(Aut(L)) of Aut(L) is generated by the \u22121-isometry, and the quotient\ngroup Aut(L)/Z(Aut(L)) is isomorphic to O(R(L), qL ) (cf. [CS99]). Hence \u03c8L is surjective and\nKer \u03c8L = Z(Aut(L)).\nSince the automorphism group of L3 is isomorphic to Aut(L) \u2240 Sym3 and Aut(L3 ) =\nAut((L\u2217 )3 ), \u03c8L induces a homomorphism of groups\n\u03c8L3 : Aut((L\u2217 )3 ) \u2192 Aut(R(L)3 , w 3 ).\nBy Proposition 2.2, \u03c8L3 is surjective. It follows from Ker \u03c8L = Z(Aut(L)) that Ker \u03c8L3 =\nZ(Aut(L))3 \u223c\n= 23 . Note that \u03c8L3 is compatible with \u03c63L , that is, \u03c63L (g(v)) = \u03c8L3 (g)(\u03c63L (v)) for\n\u2217 3\ng \u2208 Aut((L ) ) and v \u2208 (L\u2217 )3 .\nAs corollaries of Proposition 2.5 and Theorem 2.8, we obtain the following well-known\nproperties of Aut(L(S)).\n\u221a\nCorollary 3.16. [Gr99] Let L = 2E8 and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of\n(R(L)3 , qL3 ) satisfying (2.2). Let G be the stabilizer of L3 in the automorphism group of L(S).\n(1) The automorphism group of L(S) is transitive on the\n\u221a set of all sublattices of L(S) isomorphic to the orthogonal direct sum of three copies of 2E8 .\n(2) G is isomorphic to an extension of the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(L)3 , w 3 ) by an elementary\nabelian 2-group of order 23 , and G has the shape 23 .(212 : (SL4 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )).\nProof. Let J be a sublattice of L(S) isomorphic to L3 . It suffices to show that there is\nan automorphism of L(S) which sends J to L3 . Let g be an orthogonal transformation of\nR24 such that g(J) = L3 . Then g(L(S)) is an even unimodular lattice of rank 24 without\nvectors of norm 2 and contains L3 . Hence \u03c63L (g(L(S))) is a maximal totally singular subspace\nof R(L)3 satisfying (2.2). Then by Theorem 2.8, there exists h \u2208 Aut(R(L)3 , w 3) such that\nh(\u03c8L3 (g(L(S)))) = S. Since \u03c63L is surjective and compatible with \u03c8L3 , there exists h\u0303 \u2208 Aut(L3 )\nsuch that h\u0303 \u25e6 g(L(S)) = L(S). Since h\u0303 \u25e6 g(J) = L3 , we have proved (1).\n17\n\n\fClearly, G is equal to the stabilizer of L(S) in Aut((L\u2217 )3 ). Since \u03c8L3 is compatible with\n\u03c63L and \u03c63L (L(S)) = S, \u03c8L3 (G) is the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(L)3 , w 3 ). Moreover, \u03c8L3 (G) is\nisomorphic to the stabilizer of S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3) in Aut(R(L)3 , w 3) by (1). Since Ker \u03c8L3 \u223c\n= 23 , we\nobtain (2) by Proposition 2.5.\nNote 3.17. Corollary 3.16 (1) and (2) were shown in [Gr99, Proposition 3.5] and [Gr99, Corollary 3.10] respectively by a similar approach.\nLet us count the number of vectors of norm 4 in L(S). The following lemma is easy.\nLemma 3.18.

Let L = 2E8 and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(L)3 , qL3 )\nsatisfying (2.2). Then the number of vectors of norm 4 in L(S) is 196560.\nProof. By Theorem 2.8 and the surjectivity of \u03c8L3 , we may assume that S = S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3). Any\nvector of norm 4 in L(S) belongs to (\u03c63L )\u22121 (0) or (\u03c63L )\u22121 (u) for some u \u2208 R(L)3 with w 3 (u) = 4.\nNote that (\u03c63L )\u22121 (0) = L3 . Hence by Lemmas 2.6 and 3.18, the number of vectors of norm 4 in\nL(S) is\n(3 \u00d7 240) + (3 \u00d7 (24 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 20 \u00d7 162 + (3 \u00d7 (24 \u2212 1) \u00d7 26 ) \u00d7 22 \u00d7 161 = 196560.\n\n4\n\nApplication to vertex operator algebras\n\nIn this section, applying the results in Section 2 to VOAs, we obtain the moonshine VOA as\na simple current extension of the tensor product of three copies of V\u221a+2E and describe some\n8\nautomorphism group of the moonshine VOA.\nThe main approach in this section is to deduce the argument of VOAs to that of quadratic\nspaces in Section 2, which is quite similar to the approaches in Section 3 for binary codes and\nlattices. For example, the transitivity of the automorphism group of the moonshine VOA on the\nset of subVOAs isomorphic to (V\u221a+2E )3 will be shown in Theorem 4.17 by using the uniqueness\n8\nof certain maximal totally singular subspaces in Theorem 2.8, which is similar to Corollaries\n3.6 and 3.16.\nFor the definitions and facts on VOAs and modules, see Section 1.\n\n4.1\n\nA construction of holomorphic VOAs\n\nLet V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT type of central charge n.

The assumption (b) corresponds to (3.2) in binary codes and (3.4) in lattices.\nIf V satisfies (a) then by Lemma 1.8 R(V ) is an elementary abelian 2-group under the fusion\nrules. In this case, we view R(V ) as an m-dimensional vector space over F2 , where |R(V )| = 2m .\n\nLemma 4.2. [DM97] (cf. [Sh07, Proposition 1.1]) Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA\nof CFT type satisfying (a). Let X be a simple VOA containing V as a full subVOA. Then the\nmultiplicity of any irreducible V -submodule of X is 1, and X is a simple current extension of\nV.\nLemma 4.3. [LY08, Theorem 1] Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT type\nsatisfying (a). Let X = \u2295[M ]\u2208T M be a simple current extension of V , where T is a subgroup\nof R(V ). Let U be an irreducible X-module and let N be an irreducible V -submodule of U. Set\nU = {W \u00d7 [N] | W \u2208 T }. Then U \u223c\n= \u2295[M ]\u2208U M as V -modules. Moreover, \u2295[M ]\u2208U M has a\nunique irreducible X-module structure extending its V -module structure up to isomorphism.\nIf V satisfies (a)\u2013(c) then the form h , i : R(V ) \u00d7 R(V ) \u2192 F2 defined by setting\nhW, W \u2032i = qV (W ) + qV (W \u2032 ) + qV (W \u00d7 W \u2032 )\n\nis non-singular and symplectic.\nLet V k be the tensor product of k copies of V . Then V k is a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA\nof CFT type of central charge nk ([ABD04, DMZ94, FHL93]). By Lemma 1.4, if V satisfies\n(a)\u2013(d) then so does V k , and (R(V )k , qVk ) = (R(V k ), qV k ). Let T be a subset of R(V )k and let\nV(T ) denote the V k -module defined by\nM\nV(T ) =\nM,\n[M ]\u2208T\n\nwhere we identify ([M(1)], [M(2)], . . . , [M(k)]) \u2208 R(V )k with the isomorphism class of irreducible V k -module \u2297ki=1 M(i) by Lemma 1.4.\n\nProposition 4.4. Let V be a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT type satisfying (a)\u2013(d)\nand let T be a subset of R(V )k . Then V(T ) has a simple VOA structure extending its V k module structure if and only if T is a totally singular subspace. Moreover, V(T ) is holomorphic\nif and only if T is a maximal totally singular subspace.\nProof. Recall that V k is a simple rational C2 -cofinite VOA of CFT type satisfying (a)\u2013(d).\nBy (c), V(T ) is Z-graded if and only if T is totally singular. Hence the first assertion follows\nfrom Proposition 1.9 and (d).\nAssume that V(T ) is holomorphic. Let U be a totally singular subspace of R(V )k containing\nT . Then by the first assertion and Proposition 1.5, the VOA V(U) containing V(T ) as a full\nsubVOA. Note that both V(U) and V(T ) are of CFT type by (b). Since V(T ) is holomorphic,\nV(U) = V(T ), and hence U = T .\nAssume that T is a maximal totally singular subspace. Let U be an irreducible V(T )module. Take an irreducible V k -submodule N of U. By Lemma 4.3, U \u223c\n= \u2295[M ]\u2208U M as V k \u2032\n\u2032\nmodules, where U = {W \u00d7 [N] | W \u2208 T }. Let W \u2208 T . Then W \u00d7 [N] \u2208 U. Since U is\nirreducible, qVk ([N]) = qVk (W \u2032 \u00d7 [N]). By qVk (W \u2032 ) = 0 we have hW \u2032 , [N]i = qVk (W \u2032 ) + qVk ([N]) +\nqVk (W \u2032 \u00d7[N]) = 0. Since T is maximal, we have T \u22a5 = T by Lemma 1.1 (1), and hence [N] \u2208 T .\nThus T = U, and U \u223c\n= V(T ) as V(T )-modules by Lemma 4.3.\n19\n\n\fRemark 4.5. By Proposition 1.5, the VOA structure on V(T ) extending its V k -module structure is uniquely determined by T up to isomorphism.\nTheorem 4.6.

If V1 = 0 then V(S)1 = 0.\n\nProof. The first assertion follows from Proposition 4.4.\nLet [M] \u2208 R(V ). By the definition of the map w : R(V ) \u2192 {0, 1, 2} and (b), the lowest\nweight of M is greater than or equal to w([M])/2. Hence for [N] \u2208 R(V k ) the lowest weight\nof N is greater than or equal to w k ([N])/2. Thus the latter assertion follows from (2.2) and\nV1 = 0.\nRemark 4.7. In general, the lowest weight of M for [M] \u2208 R(V ) may not be equal to w([M])/2.\nRemark 4.8.

It was shown in [LY07] that any holomorphic framed VOA without weight 1 subspace\nis isomorphic to the moonshine VOA V \u266e . Hence we obtain the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.10. Let V = V\u221a+2E and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(V )3 , qV3 )\n8\nsatisfying (2.2). Then the VOA V(S) is isomorphic to the moonshine VOA V \u266e .\nRemark 4.11. Let X and N be holomorphic VOAs of central charge 8 containing V as a full\nsubVOA. Then by Lemma 4.2 X \u223c\n= \u2295[M ]\u2208\u03a8 M as V -modules, where \u03a6 and\n= \u2295[M ]\u2208\u03a6 M and N \u223c\n\u03a8 are maximal totally singular subspaces of R(V ). Assume that \u03a6 \u2229 \u03a8 = {[V ]}. Then by\nProposition 2.4 and Theorem 4.10,\nM\n(A(1) \u00d7 B) \u2297 (A(2) \u00d7 B) \u2297 (A(3) \u00d7 B).\nV\u266e \u223c\n= V(S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3)) =\n[A(i)]\u2208\u03a6, [B]\u2208\u03a8\n[A(1)]\u00d7[A(2)]\u00d7[A(3)]=[V ]\n\n20\n\n\fas VOAs. Note that X and N are isomorphic to the lattice VOA VE8 associated to the E8 root\nlattice by [DM04b].\n\u221a\nRemark 4.12. Since the Leech lattice \u039b contains ( 2E8 )3 as a sublattice, the VOA V\u039b+ contains\nV 3 as a full subVOA, and so does V \u266e ([FLM88]). By the decomposition of V \u266e into irreducible\nV 3 -modules, one can directly find complementary maximal totally singular subspaces \u03a60 and\n\u03a80 of R(V ) such that V(S(\u03a60 , \u03a80 ; 3)) \u223c\n= V \u266e as V 3 -modules. Hence Theorem 4.10 follows from\nLemmas 1.1 (5), 1.6, 1.10 (4), Propositions 1.5, 4.16 (see next subsection) and Theorem 2.8.\nNote that this argument is independent of [LY07].\nNote 4.13. In [Mi04], the moonshine VOA was constructed as an extension of V 3 .\nAs an application of our description, let us count the dimension of the weight 2 subspace of\nV(S). The following lemma is easy (cf. [AD04]).\nLemma 4.14. Let [M] \u2208 R(V ).\n(1) If w([M]) = 0 then the dimension of the weight 2 subspace of M is 156.\n(2) If w([M]) = 1 then the dimension of the weight 1/2 subspace of M is 1.\n(3) If w([M]) = 2 then the dimension of the weight 1 subspace of M is 8.\nProposition 4.15. Let V = V\u221a+2E and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(V )3 , qV3 )\n8\nsatisfying (2.2). Then the dimension of the weight 2 subspace of V(S) is 196884.\nProof. By Proposition 4.16 (see next subsection), Aut(V 3 ) \u223c\n= Aut(R(V )3 , w 3 ). Hence by\nLemma 1.6 and Theorem 2.8, we may assume that S = S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3). The weight 2 subspace of\nV(S) is the direct sum of those of V 3 and irreducible V 3 -modules M with w 3 ([M]) = 4. Hence\nby Lemmas 2.6 and 4.14, the dimension of the weight 2 subspace of V(S) is\n(3 \u00d7 156) + (3 \u00d7 (25 \u2212 1)) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 82 + (3 \u00d7 (25 \u2212 1) \u00d7 28 ) \u00d7 12 \u00d7 81 = 196884.\n\n4.3\n\nAn E8 -approach to the automorphism group of V \u266e\n\nIn this subsection, as an application of Sections 2.2 and 4.2, we study the automorphism group\nof the moonshine VOA V \u266e . Note that the results in this section are independent of the fact\nthat the automorphism group of V \u266e is isomorphic to the Monster. We continue the notation of\nthe previous subsection.\nFirst, we determine the automorphism group of V k .\nProposition 4.16. Let V = V\u221a+2E . Then the automorphism group of V k is isomorphic to\n8\nAut(V ) \u2240 Symk .\nProof. Clearly, Aut(V ) \u2240 Symk acts on V k as an automorphism group.\nLet g \u2208 Aut(V k ). By Lemma 1.4, R(V k ) is identified with R(V )k . By Lemma 1.10 (3),\nk\nw ([M])/2 is the lowest weight of M for any irreducible V k -module M. Hence by Lemma\n1.2 (2) g \u2208 Aut(R(V )k , w k ). By Lemma 1.10 (4) and Proposition 2.2, Aut(R(V )k , w k ) \u223c\n=\n\u223c\nO(R(V ), qV ) \u2240 Symk = Aut(V ) \u2240 Symk . Hence g \u2208 Aut(V ) \u2240 Symk .\n\n21\n\n\fNext, we consider lifts of symmetries of the quadratic space. Let G be the automorphism\ngroup of V(S). Recall that V(S) is a simple current extension of V 3 graded by S. By (1.1),\nwe obtain a homomorphism of groups\n\u03b7 : NG (S \u2217 ) \u2192 {g \u2208 Aut(V 3 ) | g \u25e6 S = S}.\n\n(4.1)\n\nBy Proposition 1.7, \u03b7 is surjective and Ker \u03b7 = S \u2217 \u223c\n= 215 . We now prove the following theorem\nwithout properties of the Monster.\nTheorem 4.17. Let V = V\u221a+2E and let S be a maximal totally singular subspace of (R(V )3 , qV3 )\n8\nsatisfying (2.2). Let G be the automorphism group of V(S) and let H be the stabilizer of V 3 in\nG.\n(1) H = NG (S \u2217 ).\n(2) G is transitive on the set of all full subVOAs of V(S) isomorphic to the tensor product of\nthree copies of V\u221a+2E .\n8\n\n(3) H is isomorphic to an extension of the stabilizer of S in Aut(R(V )3 , w 3 ) by an elementary\nabelian 2-group of order 215 , and H has the shape 215 .(220 : (SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )).\nProof. Since the subspace of V(S) fixed by S \u2217 is V 3 , the normalizer NG (S \u2217 ) is a subgroup\nof H. Since V(S) is a simple current extension of V 3 , the multiplicity of any irreducible V 3 submodule is 1. Hence H acts on the set of irreducible V 3 -submodules as permutations, and\nH is a subgroup of the normalizer, which proves (1).\nLet X be a full subVOA of V(S) isomorphic to V 3 . It suffices to show that there is an\nautomorphism of V(S) which sends X to V 3 . By Lemma 4.2, V(S) is a simple current extension\nof X. Let T be the set of the isomorphism classes of irreducible X-submodules of V(S). Then\nby Proposition 4.4, T is a maximal totally singular subspace of R(X)(\u223c\n= R(V 3 )). Since the\nweight 1 subspace of V(S) is trivial, T satisfies (2.2). Hence by Theorem 2.8 there exists\ng \u2208 Aut(X)(\u223c\n= Aut(R(V )3 , w 3 )) such that g \u25e6 T = S. By Lemma 1.6, g \u25e6 V(S) has a VOA\nstructure isomorphic to V(S) and let g\u0303 be the isomorphism of VOAs from V(S) to g \u25e6 V(S).\nNote that the set of the isomorphism classes of irreducible submodule of g \u25e6V(S) for g\u0303(X) \u223c\n= V3\nis g \u25e6 T = S. Hence by Proposition 1.5, there is an isomorphism of VOAs h from g \u25e6 V(S)\nto V(S) such that h \u25e6 g\u0303(X) = V 3 . Thus we obtain an automorphism h \u25e6 g\u0303 of V(S) such that\nh \u25e6 g\u0303(X) = V 3 , which proves (2).\nBy Proposition 4.16, Aut(R(V )3 , w 3 ) = Aut(V 3 ) \u223c\n= Aut(V ) \u2240 Sym3 . Hence (3) follows from\n(1), (2), Proposition 2.5 and (4.1).\nCombining Theorems 4.10 and 4.17, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.18. Let V \u266e be the moonshine VOA.\n(1) The automorphism group of V \u266e is transitive on the set of all full subVOAs isomorphic to\n(V\u221a+2E )3 .\n8\n\n(2) The stabilizer of a full subVOA of V \u266e isomorphic to (V\u221a+2E )3 in the automorphism group\n8\nof V \u266e has the shape 215 .(220 : (SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 )).\nRemark 4.19. By the order of the Monster ([CCNPW85]) and the corollary above, the number\nof full subVOAs of V \u266e isomorphic to (V\u221a+2E )3 is\n8\n\n317 * 58 * 75 * 112 * 133 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 41 * 47 * 59 * 71 = 391965121389536908413379198941796875.\n22\n\n\fRemark 4.20. Assume that S = S(\u03a6, \u03a8; 3). By Proposition 2.5, NG (S \u2217 ) normalizes the\nelementary abelian 2-subgroup \u03a8\u2217(123) of S \u2217 of order 25 .\n+\nRemark 4.21. In [Sh07], V \u266e was studied as a simple current extension of V\u039b(5)\nfor a certain\n\u221a\nsublattice \u039b(5) of the Leech lattice containing ( 2E8 )3 . One can find complementary maximal\ntotally singular subspaces \u03a6\u0303 and \u03a8\u0303 of R(V ) satisfying\n+ \u223c\nV\u039b(5)\n= \u2295[M ]\u2208SpanF\n\n2\n\n{\u03a6\u0303(12) ,\u03a6\u0303(13) } M\n\nand V(S(\u03a6\u0303, \u03a8\u0303; 3)) \u223c\n=V\u266e\n\nas V 3 -modules. Hence the normalizer of \u03a8\u0303\u2217(123) (\u223c\n= 25 ) of shape 25 .216 .22+12 .Sym3 .SL5 (2) described in [Sh07] is conjugate to NG (S \u2217 ).\nNote 4.22. In [Mi04, Lemma 9.3] a subgroup of shape 27 .220 .212 .(SL4 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 ) of the stabilizer of V 3 in Aut(V \u266e ) was described as the stabilizer of certain Virasoro frame of V (cf. [LS09,\nSection 6.5]). By the shapes, it is a maximal subgroup of NG (S \u2217 ).\nNote 4.23. According to [CCNPW85], the subgroup of the Monster obtained in Theorem 4.17\nis a maximal 2-local subgroup of shape 25+10+20 .(SL5 (2) \u00d7 Sym3 ).\nAcknowledgements.
