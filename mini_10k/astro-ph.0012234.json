There is, however, not a unique way of extending\nthe standard model with supersymmetry, but it is a general practice to use\nthe simplest possible model, the minimal supersymmetric enlargement of the\nstandard model (the MSSM), usually with some additional simplifying assumptions.\nOver several years, we have developed analytical and numerical Fortran\ntools for dealing with the sometimes quite complex calculations necessary to go\nfrom given input parameters in the MSSM to actual quantitative predictions\nof relic density in the universe of the neutralinos, and the direct and indirect\ndetection rates. The program package, which we have named DarkSUSY, has\nnow reached such a level of sophistication and maturity that we find the time\nappropriate for its public release. In the following sections, we briefly describe\nthe different components of DarkSUSY, and refer the reader to our upcoming\npaper 1 for more details.\nFor download of the latest version of DarkSUSY please visit the official\nDarkSUSY website, http://www.physto.se/~edsjo/darksusy/. The version\nof DarkSUSY described here is 3.14.01-beta.\n2\n\nDefinition of the Supersymmetric model\n\nWe work in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the\nstandard model defined by, besides the particle content and gauge couplings\nrequired by supersymmetry, the superpotential and the soft supersymmetrybreaking potential. See 1,2 for details.\nIt is obvious that the parameter space of the most general MSSM is huge,\nbeing specified by 124 a priori free parameters 3 . In DarkSUSY we reduce this\nset by assuming that the off-diagonal elements of the trilinear matrices A and\nthe scalar mass matrices M are zero, and imposing CP conservation (except\nin the CKM matrix).\nWe then calculate all masses and most of the vertices entering the Feynman rules, which are all available to the user. We include several options for\nthe loop corrections to the Higgs masses.4,5,6,7 We also include loop corrections\nto the neutralino and chargino masses.8,9\n3\n\nAccelerator bounds\n\nAccelerator bounds can be checked by a call to a subroutine. By modifying\nan option, the user can impose bounds as of different moments in time. The\ndefault option in version 3.14.01-beta adopts the 2000 limits by the Particle\nData Group 10 modified slightly for the Higgs masses. The user is also free\n\ndarksusy: submitted to World Scientific on August 7, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fto use his own routine to check for experimental bounds, in which case he or\nshe would only need to provide an interface to DarkSUSY.\n\n4\n\nCalculation of the relic density\n\nIn DarkSUSY, we calculate the relic density by using the full cross section,\nincluding all resonances and thresholds and solve the Boltzmann equation\nnumerically with the method given in 11,12 .\nWhen other supersymmetric particles are close in mass to the lightest\nneutralino they will also be present at the time of freeze-out in the early Universe. When this happens so called coannihilations can take place between\nall these supersymmetric particles. We include the coannihilation processes\nbetween all charginos and neutralinos lighter than fco m\u03c7 . The mass fraction parameter fco is by default set to 2.1 or 1.4 depending on how the relic\ndensity routines are called (high accuracy or fast calculation), but can be set\nto anything by the user. We have not included coannihilations with squarks\nand staus which occurs more accidentally than the in many cases unavoidable\nmass degeneracy between the lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino.\nWe have included all two-body final states that occur at tree level, both\nfor neutralino-neutralino, neutralino-chargino and chargino-chargino annihilations. Annihilation to gg, \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 that occur at the 1-loop level are also\nincluded.\n\n5\n\nDetection rates\n\nThe different detection rates for neutralino dark matter have been calculated\nby many authors in the past. We will here only give a brief review about\nwhat is included in DarkSUSY, and which calculations they are based on. For\na more extensive list of references, we refer to 1 .\n\n5.1\n\nHalo models\n\nCurrently implemented in DarkSUSY \u0001is the spherical family of halo profiles\n\u03c1(r) \u221d 1/ (r/a)\u03b3 [1 + (r/a)\u03b1 ](\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)/\u03b1 where e.g. the Navarro, Frenk and\nWhite profile 13 is given by (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) = (1, 3, 1) and the isothermal sphere\nis given by (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) = (2, 2, 0). The velocity distribution is assumed to be a\nstandard isotropic gaussian distribution.\n\ndarksusy: submitted to World Scientific on August 7, 2018\n\n3\n\n\f5.2\n\nDirect detection\n\nThese routines calculate the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering\ncross sections on protons and neutrons assuming the quark contributions to\nthe nucleon spin from 14 . The older set of data from 15 is also available as an\noption, but the user can set their own values if they wish.\n5.3\n\nMonte Carlo simulations\n\nIn several of the indirect detection processes below we need to evaluate the\nyield of different particles per neutralino annihilation. The hadronization\nand/or decay of the annihilation products are simulated with Pythia 16 and\nthe results are tabulated. These tables are then used by DarkSUSY.\n5.4\n\nNeutrinos from the Sun and Earth\n\nNeutralinos can accumulate in the Earth and the Sun where they can annihilate pair-wise producing high energy muon neutrinos. The branching ratios\nfor different annihilation channels are calculated and the Pythia simulations\nare used to evaluate the yield of neutrinos. Neutrino interactions in the Sun\nas well as the charged current neutrino-nucleon interaction near the detector\nare also simulated with Pythia.\nThere are routines to calculate a) the neutrino flux, b) the neutrino-tomuon conversion rate and c) the neutrino-induced muon flux either differential\nin energy and angle or integrated within an angular cone and above a given\nthreshold. The new population of neutralinos in the solar system (arising\nfrom neutralinos that have scattered in the outskirts of the Sun) as described\nin 17,18,19 can optionally be included as well.\n5.5\n\nAntiprotons from halo annihilations\n\nNeutralinos can also annihilate in the Milky Way halo producing e.g. antiprotons. These propagate in the galaxy before reaching us. We have implemented\nthe propagation method described in 20 . Optionally, the antiproton fluxes can\nalso be solar modulated with the spherically symmetric model of 21 . There are\nalso other propagation models22 available as options. The antiproton fluxes\nare given differential in energy.\n5.6\n\nPositrons from halo annihilations\n\nIn neutralino annihilations in the halo we can also produce positrons. The\nflux of positrons is calculated with the propagation model in 23 (with two\n\ndarksusy: submitted to World Scientific on August 7, 2018\n\n4\n\n\fchoices of the energy dependence of the diffusion constant). The model in 24\ncan also be used as an option. The positron fluxes are given differential in\nenergy.\n5.7\n\nGamma rays from halo annihilations\n\nWe can also produce gamma rays from the halo annihilations. These are either\nmonochromatic, produced from 1-loop annihilation 25 into \u03b3\u03b3 and 26 Z\u03b3, or\nwith a continuous energy spectrum, produced from \u03c0 0 decays in quark jets27 .\nThe flux of gamma rays can be obtained in any given direction on the sky\nfor the user's choice of (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) in the halo profile. There are also routines\nto average the flux over a chosen angular resolution. The continuous gamma\nrays use Pythia simulations to calculate the gamma ray flux (differential in\nenergy, or integrated above an energy threshold).\n5.8\n\nNeutrinos from halo annihilations\n\nWe can also produce neutrinos from neutralino annihilations in the halo. Although the fluxes are small, there are routines to calculate a) the neutrino flux,\nb) the neutrino-to-muon conversion rate and c) the neutrino-induced muon\nflux either differential in energy and angle or integrated within an angular\ncone and above a given energy threshold.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nOver the years we have developed this numerical package, DarkSUSY, for\nneutralino dark matter calculations in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, MSSM. The package is now publically released and available\nfor download from http://www.physto.se/~edsjo/darksusy. We have here\npresented an overview of what the program can do, and refer the reader to the\nupcoming paper 1 , where the details will be given. A test program, provided\nwith the distribution, shows in more detail how DarkSUSY is used.\nAcknowledgments\nL.B. and J.E. thank the Natural Sciences Research Council for their support.\nWe also thank the Aspen Center for Physics, where parts of this release were\nprepared.\n\ndarksusy: submitted to World Scientific on August 7, 2018\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n1.
