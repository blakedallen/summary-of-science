However, QCD does not exclude the existence of other color singlet objects containing additional\nquark-antiquark pairs or gluons as constituents. Within a chiral soliton model Diakonov, Petrov, and\n\u2217 corresponding\n\nauthor, email:wolfgang.eyrich@physik.uni-erlangen.de\n\n1\n\n\fPolyakov [2] predicted the existence of an anti-decuplet of baryonic states with J p = 1/2+ consisting of four\nquarks and one anti-quark. Three members of this anti-decuplet are manifestly exotic, having combinations\nof strangeness and isospin not allowed for three-quark systems. The lightest of these exotic states is the\n\u0398+ pentaquark with a quark content of uudds\u0304 and thus strangeness S = +1, a predicted mass of about\n1.53 GeV/c2 [2], and rather narrow width of less than 15 MeV [3].\nThe first experimental evidence for a narrow S = +1 baryonic resonance in the predicted mass region\ncame from the LEPS collaboration at SPring8 [4] who observed a peak in the K + n invariant system at\n1.54 GeV/c2 in the \u03b3n \u2192 K + K \u2212 n reaction on 12 C. Shortly after, the DIANA collaboration found evidence\nin the K 0 p system in a re-analysis of bubble chamber data of the reaction K + Xe \u2192 K 0 pX [5]. Soon after\nthese first observations positive signals indicating the existence of a narrow resonance in this mass region\nwere also reported by CLAS [6, 7], SAPHIR [8], HERMES [9], ZEUS [10], COSY-TOF [11], SVD-2 [12], by\nAsratyan et al. [13], and by Aslanyan et al. [14] in a large variety of reactions including even neutrino-induced\nprocesses [13].\nEvidence from these experiments was claimed for the existence of a narrow state in the systems K 0 p\nand K + n in the mass region between 1.522 and 1.555 GeV/c2 . In each of these cases the signal is based\non at most 50 events. Thus, none of these experiments has the statistical accuracy required to establish\nthe existence of the \u0398+ . Moreover, several experiments particularly at high energies including BES [15],\nBABAR [16], Belle [17], HERA-B [18], SPHINX [19], HyperCP [20], CDF [21], and FOCUS [22] did not\nconfirm the state and set upper limits on the production cross section. Although the production mechanism\nof the \u0398+ pentaquark in the high energy reactions studied may differ strongly from that for conventional\nbaryonic states, the null results cast additional doubt on the existence of the \u0398+ .\nIn the meantime a series of improved experiments and analyses were carried out by the groups who had\nreported a positive signal in their first experiments in order to obtain data with higher statistical accuracy.\nRecently, the results of dedicated experiments at CLAS were published. These yielded negative results both\non hydrogen [23] and deuterium targets [24]. The high statistics null result on the hydrogen target is in clear\ncontradiction to the SAPHIR result [8]. The negative result on the deuterium target does not agree with the\nearlier positive result of CLAS in the channel \u03b3d \u2192 pK \u2212 \u0398+ and sets an upper limit to the \u0398+ production\ncross section. In contrast, SVD-2 [25] and DIANA [26] analyzed additional data which were not included in\nthe first publications with optimized analysis methods. Both groups confirmed their previous positive results\nwith increased significance. Furthermore, DIANA estimated the \u0398+ width to be only 0.4 MeV. A recent\nmeasurement at KEK [27] of the channel \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 K \u2212 X revealed a bump at 1.530 GeV/c2 in the K \u2212 missing\nmass spectrum with a significance of 2.5 \u03c3. A recent dedicated experiment of the LEPS Collaboration shows\na peak around 1.530 GeV/c2 in the channel \u03b3d \u2192 pK \u2212 \u0398+ [28], for which CLAS did not confirm its previous\npositive result. However, the detector acceptance regions covered by these experiments are different.\nRecent theoretical studies by Sibirtsev et al. [29][30], by Roberts [31], and by Diakonov [32] obtain small\nvalues of about 1 MeV as upper limit for the \u0398+ width. Ref. [32] reviews the present experimental status\nand concludes that for a width below 1 MeV as estimated by DIANA [26] the existence of the \u0398+ is not ruled\nout by the recent negative results including those of CLAS [23][24]. In this situation further measurements\nwith improved accuracy using different reactions were needed to clarify the \u0398+ puzzle.\nIn this letter we report on the results of an experiment studying the pp \u2192 pK 0 \u03a3+ reaction with the\nCOSY-TOF spectrometer with substantially improved statistical accuracy and extended detection capability.\nCOSY-TOF is the only experiment involved in \u0398+ studies which provides an exclusive measurement of the\nfinal state in pp collisions, and it is unique in its almost complete coverage of the three-body phase space.\nMoreover the exclusive measurement selects the strangeness in the K 0 p system to be S = +1, which is a\nunique feature for experiments searching for the \u0398+ in the K 0 p system.\nIn the following the improved experimental setup will be described and the results obtained by three\n2\n\n\findependent analyses will be presented.\n\n2\n\nExperiment\n\nThe experiment was performed at the cooler synchrotron COSY with the COSY-TOF spectrometer [33].\nThe preceeding measurement [11] was carried out at a beam momentum of 2.95 GeV/c, a slightly higher\nmomentum of 3.059 GeV/c was chosen for the new measurement. At this higher momentum the upper\nbound of the K 0 p invariant mass is 1.597 GeV/c2 and therefore a possible structure at 1.530 GeV/c2 is\nfurther removed from the upper mass limit.\nThe reaction pp \u2192 pK 0 \u03a3+ is induced by focusing the proton beam on a spot of about 1 mm in diameter on\na liquid hydrogen target (length 4 mm, diameter 6 mm). The start detector system, which was upgraded for\nthe experiment described here, is mounted 2 cm downstream of the target. A schematic view is shown in Fig.\n1 together with the event topology of the studied reaction. The first detector is a thin scintillation counter\nwith a diameter of 15 cm, consisting of two segmented layers of 1 mm thickness. Each layer is subdivided\ninto 12 wedge shaped scintillators. This detector provides the multiplicity of the charged particles close to\nthe target as well as the start signal for the time-of-flight measurement. It is followed by a double-sided\nsilicon microstrip detector with a diameter of about 6 cm, the front and rear sides of which consist of 100\nrings and 128 sectors, respectively, giving a precise track point close to the target. At a distance of about\n10 cm and 20 cm two scintillating fiber hodoscopes are installed to obtain two further track points. These\ndetectors are required to identify the tracks from the delayed decay of KS0 mesons into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs. The\ntrack of the K 0 - meson is defined by the vertex of its decay and the primary vertex. For the measurement\ndescribed here the first hodoscope was replaced by an upgraded version. It consists of two crossed planes\nand a stereo plane at 450 , all built of squared fibers (2 mm \u00d7 2 mm), forming an inner part of about 20 cm\n\u00d7 20 cm with three layers and an outer part of about twice the size with two layers. The second hodoscope\nwith a size of about 40 cm\u00d7 40 cm consists of two crossed layers. The inner detector system covers the\nfull phase-space of the primary particles (\u03a3+ -hyperon, K 0 -meson, and proton) apart from tiny holes with a\ndiameter of about 2 mm for the beam.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Schematic view of the start region with the track pattern of a pp \u2192 pK 0 \u03a3+ event\n\nThis also holds for the outer detector system, which consists of 96 scintillating bars arranged as a barrel\nwith radius of 1.5 m and length of 2.8 m, and a forward wall at 3.3 m distance from the target [34][35]. The\nouter detector provides the stop signal for the time-of-flight measurement as well as additional track points.\nThe trigger condition is based on the increase in charged-particle multiplicity between the start scintillator\nand the outer detector system, which results from the KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay (see Fig. 1). The used trigger\nreduces the event rate by a factor of about 104 .\nThe TOF spectrometer supplies very good position information due to its high granularity allowing track\nreconstruction. Together with time-of-flight information this is exploited in the three analyses of the data\nin various ways, as described in the following section.\n\n3\n\nData Analysis\n\nThe analysis was carried out with three independent analysis programs (A, B, C), which differ in algorithms\nand event selection methods, but are based on a common calibration of all detector components. In order to\ncross-check each analysis the complete data sample was divided into two independent parts (events recorded\n\n4\n\n\fwith either even or odd number). The analysis procedures were developed using even events only and the\nodd events were analyzed only after the analysis procedures were frozen.\nA pK 0 \u03a3+ event is identified according to Figure 1 by its topology, that is a prompt track emerging from\nthe target (proton), a delayed decay (K 0 ) and optionally a kink in a charged track (\u03a3+ ).\nA prompt track emerging from the target is assigned to a proton. The \u03c72 of a straight line fit and the\nnumber of detector elements with hits on this track are used as quality criteria, which serve for the track\nselection. The selection parameters are different in the three analyses. The momentum is calculated from the\ntime-of-flight and the proton mass. The KS0 is reconstructed from the invariant mass of the decay particles\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The secondary vertex is reconstructed from the fitted pion tracks and restricted to the region between\nthe microstrip detector and the first fiber hodoscope. The plane defined by these tracks must contain the\nprimary vertex. In order to discriminate against the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay the different analyses place different\nselections on the angles of the decay particles with respect to the KS0 direction and on their velocities. The\n\u03a3+ is identified by a kink in a charged particle track. The direction of the \u03a3+ is measured with the silicon\nmicro strip detector.\nThe main aspects in which the analyses differ, are the following: AnalysisA: The \u03a3+ is reconstructed\nfrom the missing mass of the pK 0 system, the value of the missing mass is used as the final selection criterion.\nAs the \u03a3+ signal in the microstrip detector is not required, no constraint on the \u03a3+ decay vertex is imposed.\nAnalysis B: The detection of a kink due to the \u03a3+ decay is required. The direction of the \u03a3+ is calculated\nfrom the microstrip detector pixel and the primary vertex. For the two subsystems \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and p\u03a3+ the\ninvariant and missing mass are calculated, respectively. Both calculations require the direction of K 0 in\naddition. If there is more than one candidate topology for a pK 0 \u03a3+ event, the topology with the minimum\ndifference of both calculated masses to the K 0 mass is chosen. A 3C-kinematic fit is applied to the final\nevent. Event selection is based on the subsystem masses and on the \u03c72 of the kinematic fit. Analysis C: The\n\u03a3+ is identified as in analysis B. A 3C-kinematic fit is applied for all possible topologies of one event, that\nwith the lowest \u03c72 is selected, if the \u03c72 is lower than a given limit.\nIn all analyses an instrumental background from incorrectly reconstructed events in the data sample was\ninvestigated by various methods. These include side band investigations and variations of the maximum \u03c72 .\nThe background was found to be smooth in the pK 0 , p\u03a3+ and K 0 \u03a3+ invariant mass distributions. The\nbackground is determined to be 21% (A), 25% (B), 28% (C).\nThe corrections for detector acceptance and for the efficiencies of the analyses are deduced from Monte\nCarlo simulations that use an equal population of 3-body phase space as input. The efficiencies of the\nanalyses (including all branching ratios) are (2.0 \u00b1 0.1) * 10\u22123 (B,C) and (4.2 \u00b1 0.2) * 10\u22123 (A). The latter one\nis larger since there is no restriction on the location of the \u03a3+ -decay vertex. The resolution in the invariant\nmass distribution of the pK 0 subsystem is \u03c3 = 6 MeV/c2 for analyses A,C and 5 MeV/c2 for analysis B as\ndeduced from Monte Carlo.\nElastically scattered events were recorded in parallel in order to determine the luminosity. In total 1.3*1010\nevents were recorded with an integrated luminosity of (214 \u00b1 20) nb\u22121 . Approximately 4000 pK 0 \u03a3+ events\nin analysis B,C, and 7900 events in analysis A, are reconstructed. Due to the different strategies of the\nanalysis about 300 events are found both in B and C. For each combination A,B and A,C about 600 events\nare shared. Therefore, in total more than 12.000 independent pK 0 \u03a3+ events were reconstructed.\n\n4\n\nEvaluation of results\n\nThe total cross section, obtained by the different analyses, is given in Table 1. Only statistical errors are\nquoted. The systematic error of the total cross section is estimated to be \u00b1 1 \u03bcb. It is mainly caused by\n\n5\n\n\funcertainties in the determination of both the luminosity and the detection and reconstruction efficiencies.\nanalysis\nA\nB\nC\n\ncross section\n6.9 \u03bcb \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcb\n7.0 \u03bcb \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcb\n7.0 \u03bcb \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcb\n\nTable 1: Total cross section of pp \u2192 pK 0 \u03a3+\nThe invariant mass spectra of the subsystems pK 0 , p\u03a3+ , and K 0 \u03a3+ as extracted from the three analyses\nare shown in Fig. 2 after background subtraction and acceptance correction.\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\ninvariant mass pK [GeV/c ]\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dM [\u03bcb/(GeV/c )]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n+\n\n0\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\ninvariant mass p\u03a3 [GeV/c ]\n2\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.7\n\n0\n\n1.8\n0 +\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\ninvariant mass K \u03a3 [GeV/c ]\n2\n\nFigure 2: The invariant masses for the three subsystems in the pK 0 \u03a3+ final state.

They were analyzed in order to determine the\nstatistical significance with which a narrow structure might be present. A narrow structure was added to the\npolynomial described above. The shape of this narrow structure has been taken from Monte Carlo simulations\n\n7\n\n\f\u03c3tot,X [\u03bcb]\n\nof a resonance with a width negligible compared to the detector resolution.

The strength of the structure for\neach setting was varied between \u22121 \u03bcb < \u03c3tot,X < +1 \u03bcb.

For\neach combination of MpK 0 and \u03c3tot,X the value of \u03c72 of the fit to the data was determined.

The central lines of each band present the\ncontribution of a hypothetical narrow resonance with the lowest \u03c72 value.\n\nIn this figure the value of \u03c3tot,X corresponding to the minimal value of \u03c72 is represented by the central\nline of the band as a function of MpK 0 . The 95% confidence interval for an enhancement or suppression of\nthe measured MpK 0 differential cross section is indicated by the width of the band. The results presented\nin Figure 4 indicate that over the full MpK 0 range investigated here the parameterization assuming \u03c3tot,X\n= 0 \u03bcb is consistent with the measured data within the 95% confidence level. In particular, this new,\n\n8\n\n\fhigher statistics data do not contain positive evidence for a narrow structure at MpK 0 =1.530 GeV/c2 .\nThe fluctuation of the central value of the 95% confidence intervals are not correlated between the different\nanalyses. Based upon the smallest upper limit of the three 95% confidence intervals the maximum cross\nsection for a narrow resonance \u03c3tot,X < 0.15 \u03bcb has been deduced over the full mass range.\nThese results also have to be compared with the positive evidence for a \u0398+ resonance found in the\ndata of the first measurement [11]. First of all the number of reconstructed events is much larger for the\nnew measurement - about a factor of 4 for analyses B and C and about a factor of 8 for analysis A which gives a strongly improved statistical accuracy. In addition, the three largely different analyses give\na better understanding of systematic uncertainties. In the previous measurement the peak was located\n32 MeV/c2 below the upper kinematic limit of the populated pK 0 mass range and therefore resided on a\ncontinuum background with a steep negative slope. This caused uncertainties in the determination of the\nbackground. Therefore, in the present experiment a higher excess energy was chosen. Comparing the pK 0\nspectra obtained in this work with the published one [11] a significant difference in the shape, which is\nmore symmetric in the new measurement, is noticed. Since the pK 0 invariant mass distribution obtained\nin the new experiment is based on three independent analysis procedures including systematic studies of\nthe instrumental background, we are confident in the symmetric shape of the pK 0 continuum. The data\npoints of the three different analyses together with their uncertainties define a band, which represents the\ncontinuum shape of these analyses.\n\nFigure 5: Invariant mass of the pK 0 spectrum of the previous measurement together with a band representing\nthe shape of the new measurement. The height of the band is adjusted in the mass range indicated by the\ntwo vertical lines.\nIn order to compare it to the previous data, this band is scaled to the kinematically allowed range. Fitting\nits height within a mass region between 1.48 GeV/c2 and 1.57 GeV/c2 , symmetric with respect to the peak\nobserved at 1.53 GeV/c2 [11], the significance of the peak decreases substantially if this shape is used as\ncontinuum for the previous data (see Figure 5).\n\n9\n\n\f5\n\nSummary\n\nThe reaction pp \u2192 pK 0 \u03a3+ was studied in an exclusive measurement at a beam momentum of 3.059 GeV/c\nwith complete phase space coverage. The extracted pK 0 spectra do not show evidence for a narrow resonance\nin the mass region of 1.50 GeV/c2 - 1.55 GeV/c2 in any of the three independent analyses. The data are\nconsistent with a cross section of \u03c3tot,X = 0 \u03bcb and an upper limit of 0.15 \u03bcb is derived with a confidence\nlevel of 95%. The evidence for a \u0398+ , which was found in a preceding measurement, is not confirmed.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank very much the COSY accelerator team for the preparation of the excellent proton\nbeam and for the good cooperation.
