The current weak lensing studies are mostly limited to reduced-shear\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n29 October 2018\n\n\festimates that involve statistical study of galaxy ellipticities or shape information reconstructed through expansions related to certain orthogonal basis\nfunctions (for a recent review, see, Refregier 2003). Such a lensing reconstruction, unfortunately, is limited to resolved background sources for which reliable shape measurements, after accounting for the point spread function, are\npossible. While statistics of current and most upcoming weak lensing surveys\nare expected to be limited by instrumental constraints, such as issues related\nto the point spread function, with reasonable improvements on the observational side, the statistics related to large scale structure lensing studies will\neventually be limited by the number of resolved background sources. In this\nlimit, to further improve mass reconstruction related to lensing, background\nobjects which are intrinsically point-sources, and, thus, for which shape measurements are impossible, must be included in the analysis. A situation where\npoint-sources dominate resolved source number counts is already present in\nsome of the deepest space-based images available to date, including North and\nSouth Hubble Deep Fields and recent images from the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope.\nAs one moves to higher source redshifts, beyond what is currently encountered\nin large scale structure lensing studies, the importance of point sources is more\nevident; The first stars and proto galaxies, at redshifts of order 15 to 30 and\nhigher, provide an ideal background for lensing studies given the large path\nlength to these background sources. While the detection of an individual first\nstar is beyond the capabilities of even next generation instruments, the spatial\nfluctuations in the integrated diffuse background emission from these stars, at\nleast in most optimistic models of their emission, may be within reach (e.g.,\nCooray et al. 2003). During the transit to us, this diffuse emission is expected\nto be affected by the intervening mass distribution via gravitational lensing\nand provides a background for a potentially interesting lensing study.\nContrary to background intensities at optical and infra-red wavelengths (Cooray\net al. 2003; Knox et al. 2001), where the emission can eventually be broken\ndown to point sources, one also encounter backgrounds which are composed\nof truly diffuse emission that cannot easily be separated to individual objects.\nExamples of such diffuse backgrounds are the 21 cm rest wavelength emission\nfrom neutral Hydrogen in the intergalactic medium prior to reionization (Scott\n& Rees 1990; Madau et al. 1997; Tozzi et al. 1997; Iliev et al. 2002; Furlanetto\net al. 2003) and, of course, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The lensing effect on CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations,\nthat were generated at the last scattering surface (Peebles & Yu 1970; Sunyaev\n& Zel'dovich 1970; Silk 1968; Hu & Dodelson 2001), is now well understood\n(Seljak 1996; Metcalf & Silk 1997; Hu 2000) and various techniques have been\ndeveloped to extract lensing information from high resolution CMB temperature and polarization maps (Zaldarriaga & Seljak 1999; Benabed et al. 2001;\nGuzik et al. 2000; Hu 2001; Hu & Okamoto 2002; Cooray & Kesden 2003;\n2\n\n\fHirata & Seljak 2003). These techniques make use of the fact that at the last\nscattering surface, where primary CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations are generated, these anisotropies follow a Gaussian distribution, while\nwith gravitational lensing deflections when propagating to us, the fluctuations\npattern on the sky is non-Gaussian (Bernardeau 1997; Hu 2001; Zaldarriaga\n2000; kesden et al. 2002). The lensing extraction techniques make use of measurements related to certain non-Gaussian aspects, such as a collapsed form of\nthe trispectrum (Zaldarriaga 2000; Hu 2001), which is related to a filtered version of the squared-temperature power spectrum (Cooray & Kesden 2003), to\ndirectly estimate and reconstruct the deflection angle or the projected lensing\npotential power spectrum.\nIn the case of CMB, the study of lensing and its extraction is usually considered under a perturbative approach with the deflection angle as a small change\nto the anisotropy on the sky towards a given direction (Hu 2000; Goldberg\n& Spergel 1998; Cooray & Hu 1998; Zaldarriaga 2000). Under such an approach, for most practical purposes, the lensing effect can be calculated up\nto the second order in the deflection angle or first order in the lensing potential power spectrum. Since the rms deflection angle for a photon propagating\nfrom a redshift of 1100 is of order a few arcminute, a resulting complication\nhere is that perturbative description of the lensing effect breaks down at small\nangular scales at and below the rms deflection angle. This, however, is not\na major concern for the CMB lensing description since there is no intrinsic\nsmall angular scale power at these same angular scales due to the presence of\nsignificant damping. On the other hand, when compared to CMB temperature fluctuations, diffuse backgrounds at lower redshifts are expected to show\nsubstantial clustering power at arcminute angular scales and the perturbative\napproach just to the first order in the deflection power spectrum may not be an\nadequate description. Another important difference, when compared to CMB\nanisotropies that were generated at the last scattering surface with narrow\nrange in redshift, is that background sources may be distributed over a wide\nrange in redshift and this distribution must be properly accounted as well.\nWhile there are complications from foregrounds and other confusions, we suggest that techniques developed to extract lensing information from CMB data\ncan also be extended and applied at other wavelengths for lensing studies.\nIn the case of CMB anisotropies, there are substantial modifications to the\nanisotropy angular power spectrum from the lensing effect due to the acoustic\npeak structure and the presence of a damping tail such that lensing transfers\npower from large scales to arcminute scales where the lensing effect is easily\ndetectable. When compared to a lensing study with CMB, the lensing information one can extract from low redshift diffuse backgrounds is significantly\nlimited. As we will discuss, this results from the fact that, at arcminute angular scales, the lensing modification to the power spectrum is minor and the\nnon-Gaussianities generated are relatively smaller. This, again, is due to the\n3\n\n\flack of features in the clustering power spectrum such that the modification\nto the clustering pattern, at arcminute angular scales of interest for future\nobservations, remains the same under gravitational lensing. The lack of significant differences between the intrinsic and lensed power spectra, thus, limits\nthe use of statistics such as clustering variance for lensing purposes.\nTo extract lensing information better, one require arcsecond scale clustering\ninformation, though at such small angular scales, a substantial number of\nsources that contribute to the diffuse background will begin to be resolved.\nIn the limit that most or all sources are resolved to point-like objects, instead\nof shear reconstruction based on source shapes, statistics related to the distribution of the point sources can also be used for a shear estimation. As an\nexample, instead of extracting information from the non-Gaussian clustering\ninformation, one can make use of the anisotropy of clustering generated by\nforeground lensing. This anisotropy can be used as an estimator of shear and\ncan be approached in the same manner ellipticity information from galaxy\nshapes are used for an estimate of shear. Such a study has already been attempted towards known regions of mass concentrations, such as galaxy clusters\n(van Waerbeke et al. 1997). Similar studies can be extended to large angular\nscales and the large scale structure as a whole when carefully selected backgrounds are selected for lensing reconstruction so as to minimize confusions\nresulting from foregrounds. Another aspect is the change resulting from lensing magnification and several suggestions have already been made to include\nunresolved sources in weak lensing studies through variations associated with\nnumber counts and, when measurable, source sizes (Jain 2002; Pen 2003).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the lensing\neffect on diffuse backgrounds and extend calculations related to weak lensing\neffect on CMB anisotropies. As an example, we discuss the lensing modification\nof the near-IR anisotropy fluctuations due to first stars following calculations,\nrelated to spatial clustering discussed in Cooray et al. (2003). We discuss the\nextent to which lensing information can be extracted from this and other backgrounds and a comparison to the lensing extraction with CMB data. We also\nconsider potential biases and systematic effects for a lensing reconstruction\nand conclude with a summary.\n\n2\n\nCalculation\n\n2.1 Lensing Effect on Clustering of Diffuse Backgrounds\nIn order to derive the weak lensing effect on angular clustering properties\nof any diffuse background, we follow a calculation similar to that introduced\n4\n\n\ffor the lensing extraction from CMB temperature anisotropies (e.g., Hu 2001;\nSeljak & Zaldarriaga 1999; Cooray & Kesden 2003) and make use of the flat sky\napproximation. When compared to CMB, there is one important difference in\nthat one should properly account for the broad redshift distribution of sources\nthat contribute to the background light, instead of the assumption related to a\nnarrow source redshift distribution. Thus, we break the background intensity\nas\nItot (n\u0302) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndr\u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) ,\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) is the fractional contribution to the total emission as a function\nof the radial distance or look-back time, from the observer:\nr(z) =\n\nZz\n0\n\ndz \u2032\n,\nH(z \u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhen the expansion rate for adiabatic CDM cosmological models with a cosmological constant is given by\nh\n\ni\n\nH 2 = H02 \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9K (1 + z)2 + \u03a9\u039b .\n\n(3)\n\nHere, H0 can be written as the inverse Hubble distance today cH0\u22121 = 2997.9h\u22121\nMpc. We follow the conventions that in units of the critical density 3H02 /8\u03c0G,\nthe contribution of each component is denoted \u03a9i , i = c for the CDM, b for the\nbaryons, \u039b for the cosmological constant. We also define the auxiliary quanP\ntities \u03a9m = \u03a9c + \u03a9b and \u03a9K = 1 \u2212 i \u03a9i , which represent the matter density\nand the contribution of spatial curvature to the expansion rate respectively.\nNote that, though we discuss a general derivation of lensing effect on background source clustering, we show results for the currently favorable \u039bCDM\ncosmology with \u03a9b = 0.05, \u03a9m = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65 and h = 0.65.\nWeak lensing deflects the path of background photons resulting in a remapping of the observed anisotropy pattern on the sky, such that the fractional\ncontribution from each redshift is modified as\n \u0303\n\u03b4I(rn\u0302,\nr) = \u03b4I[r{n\u0302 + \u2207\u03c6(rn\u0302, r)}, r]\n1\n\u2248 \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) + \u2207i \u03c6(rn\u0302, r)\u2207i \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) + \u2207i \u03c6(rn\u0302, r)\u2207j \u03c6(rn\u0302, r)\u2207i \u2207j \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) + . .(4)\n. .\n2\nHere, \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) is the unlensed fractional component of the background light\n \u0303\nfrom a distance of r, \u03b4I(rn\u0302,\nr) is the same contribution when affected by the\ngravitational lensing deflections during the transit, and \u2207\u03c6(rn\u0302, r) represents\n5\n\n\fthe lensing deflection angle for a photon propagating from a distance of r. The\nsecond line of Eq. 4 treats the lensing deflection as a perturbative parameter.\nTypical lensing calculations related to CMB (e.g., Hu 2000), treat lensing effect on the angular power spectrum to the second order in this perturbation\nexpansion, while lensing extraction techniques related to CMB consider information from the first order correction (e.g., Seljak & Zaldarriaga 2000; Hu\n2001). Such an approach works well since CMB has no intrinsic anisotropy\nat small angular scales below few arcminutes, though the typical deflection\nangle of a photon from the last scattering surface is \u223c 2.5 arcminutes. The\naccuracy to which lensing can be extracted from CMB under this perturbative\napproach is discussed in Hirata & Seljak (2003). Here, for low redshift diffuse\nbackgrounds, the perturbation expansion up to second order in the deflection\nangle is not adequate to fully account for the lensing effect on the clustering power spectrum. We extend the calculation explicitly to higher order and\npresent an exact derivation of the lensed power spectrum which should be\nvalid even at small angular scales where the lensing deflection angle is of the\nsame order. To properly evaluate the lensed contribution, however, one must\nevaluate an infinite series of integrals which is numerically exhaustive; here, in\npresenting numerical results, we only consider the lensed power spectrum up to\nthe fourth order in deflection angle or the second order in the deflection-angle\npower spectrum.\nIn equation 4, where \u2207\u03c6 is the deflection angle, \u03c6 is a radial projection of the\ngravitational potential, \u03a6 (see, e.g. Kaiser 1992), for a source at a distance rs\n\n\u03c6(rs m\u0302, rs ) = \u22122\n\nZrs\n0\n\ndr \u2032\n\ndA (rs \u2212 r \u2032 )\n\u03a6(r \u2032 m\u0302, r \u2032 ) ,\ndA (rs )dA (r \u2032)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the comoving angular diameter distance is\n\u22121/2\n\ndA = H0\u22121 \u03a9K\n\n1/2\n\nsinh(H0 \u03a9K r) .\n\n(6)\n\nNote that as \u03a9K \u2192 0, dA \u2192 r.\nTaking the Fourier transform, as appropriate for a flat-sky, we write the modification to the fraction contribution arising at a distance r as\n \u0303 1) =\n\u03b4I(l\n\nZ\n\n\u2212il1 *n\u0302\n \u0303\ndn\u0302 \u03b4I(n\u0302)e\n\n= \u03b4I(l1 ) \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u20321\n\u03b4I(l1 \u2032 )L(l1 , l1 \u2032 ) ,\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n\nwhere\n6\n\n(7)\n\n\fd2 l\u2032\u20321\n\u03c6(l1 \u2032\u2032 )\n(2\u03c0)2\nZ\nZ\nd2 l\u2032\u20321\nd2 l\u2032\u2032\u2032\n1\n1\n\u03c6(l1 \u2032\u2032 )\u03c6(l1 \u2032\u2032\u2032 )\n\u00d7 \u03c6(l1 \u2212 l1 \u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032 ) (l1 \u2032\u2032 * l1 \u2032 )(l1 \u2212 l1 \u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032 ) * l1 \u2032 +\n6 (2\u03c0)2 (2\u03c0)2\n\u00d7 \u03c6(l1 \u2212 l1 \u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) (l1 \u2032\u2032 * l1 \u2032 )(l1 \u2032\u2032\u2032 * l1 \u2032 ) (l1 \u2212 l1 \u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 l1 \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) * l1 \u2032 . + ....\n(8)\n1\nL(l1 , l1 ) \u2261 \u03c6(l1 \u2212 l1 ) (l1 \u2212 l1 ) * l1 \u2212\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nHere, for simplicity, we have dropped the explicit dependence on the radial\ndistance, r, in \u03b4I and \u03c6, and have expanded the correction to the third order\nin \u03c6.\nWe define the power spectrum of the total intensity fluctuation field, in the\nflat sky approximation, following the usual way\nhI(l)I(l\u2032 )i \u2261 (2\u03c0)2 \u03b4D (l + l\u2032 )Cl ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b4D is the Dirac delta function. Similarly, the power spectrum of the\n \u0303\nlensed fluctuation field, with I(l) replaced by I(l),\nis C\u0303l .\nNote that in the absence of lensing, the observed anisotropy power spectrum is\nsimply the sum of anisotropy Rcontributions over the normalized source redshift\ndistribution such that Cl = drCl\u03b4I . The observed angular power spectrum,\nhowever, consists of both the unlensed intensity and a perturbative correction\nrelated to the lensing effect. To calculate the final lensed-clustering power\nspectrum, we first substitute Eq. 7 in Eq. 1 and reintroduce the dependence\non distance. The lensing contribution to the power spectrum is calculated\nfollowing approaches used to describe lensing effect on CMB anisotropies (e.g.,\nHu 2000) and after some straight forward calculations, we obtain, to the fourth\norder in \u03c6 or second order in Cl\u03c6 :\n\nC\u0303l = Cl \u2212 l\n\n2\n\nZ\n\ndrR(r)Cl\u03b4I\n\nl2\n1 \u2212 R(r)\n2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nh\ni\nd2 l1\n\u03c6\n2\n\u03b4I\n2\n1\n\u2212\n|l\n\u2212\nl\n|\nR(r)\ndrC\n(r)C\n[(l\n\u2212\nl\n)\n*\nl\n]\n+\n1\n1\n1\n|l\u2212l1 |\nl1\n(2\u03c0)2\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd2 l1\nd2 l2\n1\n\u03b4I\ndrCl\u03c61 (r)Cl\u03c62 (r)C|l\u2212l\n[(l \u2212 l1 \u2212 l2 ) * l1 ]2 [(l \u2212 l1 \u2212 l2 ) * l2 ]2 ,\n+\n1 \u2212l2 |\n2 (2\u03c0)2 (2\u03c0)2\n(10)\nZ\n\nZ\n\nwhere Cl\u03b4I is the fractional contribution to the intensity fluctuation power\nspectrum as a function of the radial distance (see, Section 2.2) and\n1 Z\nR(r) =\ndll3 Cl\u03c6 (r) .\n4\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\n7\n\n\fThe cumulativeR variance of intensity\nfluctuations is conserved under lensing\nR 2\n2\n2\n2\nsuch that \u03c3 \u2261 d l/(2\u03c0) C\u0303l = d l/(2\u03c0)2 Cl ; this is equivalent to the fact that\nlensing does not create or destroy power but rather results in a redistribution\nsuch that surface brightness remains conserved. Under lensing, however, the\nfiltered variance\nof fluctuations as a function of angular scale is different such\nR 2\n2\nthat \u03c3 (\u03b8) \u2261 d l/(2\u03c0)2 C\u0303l W 2 (l\u03b8), where W (l\u03b8) is the Fourier transform of\nthe filter - such as top-hat, Gaussian etc. - is different from that expected\nR\nfrom the unlensed clustering power spectrum, d2 l/(2\u03c0)2 Cl W 2 (l\u03b8). While the\nmodification to variance resulting from lensing can be used for a reconstruction\nof convergence (Pen 2003), such a measurement only works out accurately\nif the differences between C\u0303l and Cl is significant, as a function of angular\nscale or multipole l, under gravitational lensing. While this is the case for\narcminute scale power spectrum of CMB anisotropies, we will show that the\ndifference between intrinsic- and lensed-power spectra of diffuse backgrounds\nis insignificant and will complicate a straight forward lensing reconstruction\nbased on the variance alone.\nIn the case of CMB anisotropies, in Eq. 1, \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) = I cmb (n\u0302)\u03b4D (r \u2212r0 ) where\nr0 is the distance to the surface of last scattering and I cmb (n\u0302) is the total\nCMB intensity such that for spatial fluctuations, Cl\u03b4I = Clcmb \u03b4D (r \u2212 r0 ) with\nthe primordial anisotropy power spectrum given by Clcmb .

To evaluate the contribution accurately, one should include terms\nwhich are same order in Cl\u03c6 and R; For example, to the second order in Cl\u03c6 ,\ncontributions include three terms from the first line in Eq. 14, two terms from\nthe second and a term from the third, when exponentials in each of the above\nlines are expanded.\nNote that the lensing effect only modifies the clustering pattern of an intrinsically clustered background. If the spatial distribution of sources responsible\nfor the diffuse background is simply Poisson, then one expects a shot-noise\nlike angular power spectrum for fluctuations in the intensity such that Cl\u03b4I is\na constant. In this case, Eq. 10 can be simplified and leads to C\u0303l = Cl such\nthat spatial fluctuations, after lensing, remains a Poisson distribution with the\nsame shot-noise. This is again consistent with the fact that lensing does not\n9\n\n\fcreate or destroy power but only results in a modification to how power is\ndistributed.\nThe same can also be deduced from Eq. 14 by taking into account the exact\ncalculation instead of the approximate one in Eq. 10. In the case of an intrinsic\nPoisson-clustered power spectrum, or a smooth or slowly varying intrinsic\nCMB\npower spectrum, one can set C|l\u2212...\u2212l\n= ClCMB with the substitution that\nn|\n|l \u2212 ... \u2212 ln | \u223c l. In this case, one can write Eq. 14 as\nC\u0303lCMB = ClCMB e\u2212l\n+\n\n2 R(r\n\n0)\n\nn\n\n1 + ...\n\no\n1 Z d2 l1 Z d2 ln \u03c6\n\u03c6\n2\n2\n,\n(r\n)[l\n*\nl\n]\n...[l\n*\nl\n]\n...\nC\n(r\n)...C\n1\nn\n0\nln 0\nn! (2\u03c0)2\n(2\u03c0)2 l1\n\n(15)\n\nwhich simplifies as C\u0303lCMB = ClCMB since the series within curly brackets is\n2\nsimply el R(r0 ) . This is important since as we discuss later, lensing only modifies\nthe clustering pattern of background sources if the distribution has distinct\nsignatures, such that the angular power spectrum show features. In the case\nof a smooth distribution, which may also be Poisson, lensing does not modify\nthe clustering pattern significantly. In this sense, most shot-noise dominated\nbackgrounds such as radio sources and galaxy clusters through the SZ effect\nat arcminute scale CMB experiments, will not be modified by gravitational\nlensing. We find a similar situation for some what higher redshift backgrounds\nat IR and other wavelengths. The only lensing modification is then associated\nwith magnification changes to source number counts (Tegmark & Villumsen\n1997) such that, down to a certain flux limit, more sources are magnified\ntowards regions of high mass concentrations and the extent to which this is\nimportant depends strongly on the distribution of number counts as a function\nof flux. For truly diffuse backgrounds such as CMB and 21cm emission from\nthe general IGM prior to reionization, such an effect is not expected.\nIn Eq. 10 and after, Cl\u03c6 (rs ) is the power spectrum of lensing potentials, for\na source at a distance of rs . In terms of the three-dimensional matter power\nspectrum, P (k), we can write this power spectrum of lensing potentials as\n\nCl\u03c6 (rs ) =\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nk dkP (k)\n\nZrs\n\ndrW\n\n\u00132\n\nG(r) dA (rs \u2212 r)\n.\na dA (r)dA (rs )\n\nlen\n\n(k, r1 )jl (kr1 )\n\nZrs\n\ndr2 W len (k, r2 )jl (kr2 )(16)\n,\n\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere\n\nW\n\nlen\n\n(k, r) = \u22123\u03a9m\n\n\u0012\n\nH0\nk\n\n10\n\n(17)\n\n\f\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n1100\n\n10\n\n5\nzs=1\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03c6\u03c6\n\nl Cl /2\u03c0\n\n15\n\nnl\n\n\u22129\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\nlin\n\u221211\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\nl\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFig. 1. Angular power spectra of the lensing deflections as a function of the source\nredshift zs . The solid lines show the fully non-linear contribution to the power spectra, while the dotted lines show the contribution under linear theory power spectrum. While low redshift lensing requires a fully non-linear treatment, for sources at\nredshifts of 15 and higher, non-linearities do not affect lensing deflections at angular\nscales at least of few arcminutes and below (l \u223c 103 ).\n\nIn terms of the well known convergence, \u03ba, power spectrum, that define the\nintegrated surface density of mass out to the background distance rs , one can\nwrite Cl\u03ba = l4 /4Cl\u03c6 . In calculating the matter power spectrum, we use the\nfitting formulae of Eisenstein & Hu (1999) to evaluate the transfer function\nfor CDM models and set the normalization to match both COBE and clusters\n(Bunn & White 1999; Viana & Liddle 1999). Note that in linear theory, the\npower spectrum can be scaled in time, P (k, r) = G2 (r)P (k, 0), using the\nthe growth function (Peebles 1980). In the non-linear regime, one can use\nprescriptions such as the fitting function by Peacock & Doods (1996) or halobased approaches (Cooray & Sheth 2002) to calculate the fully non-linear\ndensity field power spectrum.\nWe illustrate these power spectra as a function of zs , the source redshift, in\nFig. 1. Note that for sources at low redshifts, zs \u223c 1, non-linear corrections\nto the matter power spectrum is important since lensing signal from degree\nangular scales and below are dominated by non-linearities. As one moves to\na higher source redshift, non-linear corrections move to smaller angular scales\nsuch that for sources at redshifts 15 and higher, non-linear corrections are no\nlonger important as lensing statistics at arcminute scales are fully described by\nlinear fluctuations in the intervening matter density field. For CMB photons,\n11\n\n\fthe rms deflection angle, \u03b8rms = [ d2 l/(2\u03c0)2 l2 Cl\u03c6 ]0.5 , is 2.6\u2032 while for a source\nat a redshift of 15, \u03b8rms \u223c 2\u2032 . The fact that the typical deflection angle is\nof order few arcminutes, require that clustering modifications not be studied\njust to the first order perturbative correction and that higher order terms be\nincluded.\nR\n\nIn Fig. 2, we show the CMB anisotropy power spectrum and the resulting\nmodification related to the gravitational lensing effect. Note that the lensing\neffect moves power from large angular scales, where acoustic peaks are found,\nto small angular scales (Seljak 1996; Hu 2000). This results in an increase of\npower at arcminute angular scales where the damping tail of the anisotropy\npower spectrum is found. We also show the correction related to second order\nin the deflection angle power spectrum. The resulting modification related to\nthis additional higher order correction is at the level of 20%, at most, though\nit becomes significant as l \u2192 104 , suggesting that, at small angular scales,\nthe perturbative approach may be suspect to describe the lensing effect on\nCMB. Still, the approach considered in certain calculations (e.g., Hu 2000)\nis adequate since CMB anisotropies have no significant power at small angular scales and higher order terms, which are important at small angular\nscales, have a decreasing significance. For precision cosmology with arcminute\nangular-scale CMB power spectrum measurements, however, it may be useful to include higher order terms since they are above the cosmic variance\nlimit of the power spectrum measurements. In addition to these higher order\ncorrections, there are other assumptions that can complicate the interpretation of CMB lensing data. For example, the CMB power spectrum contains\nan anisotropy contribution from low redshifts through secondary effects such\nas the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (Sachs & Wolfe 1967) and the SunyaevZel'dovich effect (Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1980). Since these contributions are\nalso lensed, simply using lensed power spectrum with a narrow source at r0\nfor cosmological parameter interpretation may be problematic. This issue is\nbeyond the purpose of the present paper and we will leave it for a future study.\nAs we will now discuss, due to the smoothness of spatial fluctuations generated\nby low redshift diffuse backgrounds at IR wavelengths and at 21 cm restwavelength by neutral Hydrogen rich IGM prior to reionization, the lensing\nmodifications, at arcminute angular scales, are not significant. This limits\ntheir ability for a lensing reconstruction in the same manner as approached\nfor CMB.\n\n2.2 Diffuse Background Clustering Power Spectrum\n\nSince gravitational lensing deflections modify the clustering power spectrum\nof anisotropies in the diffuse background, we first consider an estimate of the\n12\n\n\fintrinsic spatial clustering signal. In the introduction, we identified several\npotential backgrounds that may become important for weak lensing studies\nincluding that due to first stars and galaxies in near-IR wavelengths and the\n21 cm background by the general IGM prior to reionization. Instead of making separate estimates of their clustering signals here, we consider a general\ncalculation under the assumption that background sources, either in the form\nof first stars or neutral Hydrogen, trace linear fluctuations with a bias factor\nthat can be calculated based on the halo mass in which these sources are expected. In the case of first stars, such halos are likely to have temperatures\nof 200 K, if molecular Hydrogen cooling is allowed, or 104 K, or more. In the\ncase of diffuse emission related to, say 21 cm, from the neutral hydrogen prior\nto reionization, we expect neutral Hydrogen to be present in all halos with no\ncut off at the low end of the mass distribution. In this case, it is likely that\nthe neutral Hydrogen distribution is tracing the linear density field directly\nsuch that the bias factor is close to unity.\nThe clustering of any sources at redshifts between 10 and 30 can be calculated\nfollowing standard approaches (Cooray et al. 2003). The contribution to the\nbackground intensity, say at a certain wavelength and towards a direction n\u0302,\ncan be written as a product of the mean emissivity and its fluctuation\nI(n\u0302) =\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03b4j(rn\u0302, r)\ndra(r)j\u0304(r) 1 +\n,\nj\u0304(r)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere r is the comoving radial distance (or conformal time) and j\u0304(r) is the\nmean emissivity per comoving unit volume as a function of distance. Note that\nthe integrand can now be identified with \u03b4I(rn\u0302, r) in Eq. 1. In order to calculate spatial fluctuations related to the emissivity, we assume \u03b4j(rn\u0302, r)/j\u0304(r)\ntrace fluctuations in the source density field, \u03b4s = \u03b4\u03c1s /\u03c1\u0304s such that, in Fourier\nspace,\n\u03b4j(k, z)\n= \u03b4s (k, z) .\nj\u0304(z)\n\n(19)\n\nThe density field fluctuations of emitters are defined by the three dimensional\npower spectrum, which we define as\nh\u03b4s (k, z)\u03b4s (k\u2032 , z)i = (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4D (k + k\u2032 )Pss (k, z) .\n\n(20)\n\nTo calculate the source power spectrum, as discussed, we scale the linear\nclustering power spectrum by a bias factor. While in the case of 21 cm emission\nfrom neutral gas the source bias is expected to mostly unity, for sources that\nform in halos above a certain mass cut-off, Mcut , the bias factor is simply given\n13\n\n\fby\nhbM i =\n\nR\u221e\n\nMcut dm m b(m)n(m)\nR\u221e\nMcut dm m n(m)\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere b(m) is the halo bias (Mo & White 1996; Mo et al. 1997) with respect\nto the density field and n(m) is the mass function (Press & Schechter 1974).\nUsing the Limber approximation (Limber 1954), the angular power spectrum\nfor a distribution of sources that trace a three-dimensional power spectrum\nPss (k), when projected on the sky, is given by\nCl =\n\nZ\n\na2 (r)\nl\ndr 2 j\u0304 2 (z)G2 (r)hbM (r)i2 P lin k =\n,r = 0 ,\ndA\ndA\n!\n\n(22)\n\nand the integrand is Cl\u03b4I (r) in Eq. 10.\nThe power spectrum of diffuse emission related to sources in IR is illustrated\nin Fig. 3. The calculation related to j\u0304(z) in this case follows that of Cooray et\nal. (2003) and we make use of the most optimistic model there for illustrative\npurposes here. The shape of the angular power spectrum is essentially a reflection of the projected linear power spectrum over the redshift distribution of\nbackground sources. Since first stars are more likely to be found in the similar\nredshift range as of the neutral Hydrogen, which contributes to the 21 cm\nbackground, we expect the shape of the anisotropy clustering power spectrum\nof the 21 cm background to remain the same. Due to differences in emissivity,\nof course, the clustering power spectrum will have a different amplitude in this\ncase.\nIn Fig. 3, we also show the angular power spectrum of spatial fluctuations in\nthe background diffuse emission after gravitational lensing. While the lensing\neffect results in a transfer of power from arcminute angular scales, where the\nangular power spectrum peaks, to tens of degree angular scales, where the\npower spectrum is rapidly rising, there is no substantial modification to the\nangular power spectrum at arcminute angular scales. In comparison, as shown\nin Fig. 2, the lensing effect on CMB anisotropies results in a transfer of power\nfrom degree angular scales, where the power spectrum peaks in this case, to\narcminute angular scales such that there is a substantial enhancement of power\nalong the damping tail by more than two orders of magnitude. The lack of\nlensing modification to the clustering power spectrum of diffuse backgrounds\ncan be understood based on Eq. 15 and results from that fact that clustering\nat arcminute scales is smooth and results from the collective emission from a\nlarge number of sources such that under gravitational lensing, though there\nmay be modifications to the distribution of these sources at arcsecond angular\n14\n\n\fscales, the distribution at arcminute angular scales remain the same. If any\ndifferences exist, these are at the level substantially below a percent. The lack\nof a substantial difference in the angular power spectrum before and after\ngravitational lensing suggests that statistics that primarily target two-point\nclustering information will not be useful for lensing studies. For example, the\nvariance related to the distribution of these background fluctuations will not\nbe substantially varying and we suggest that the variance measurements may\nnot be ideal. The lack of a major difference also limits the extent to which\nlensing information can be extracted from non-Gaussian statistics, such as\nthose related to the trispectrum that have been considered with respect lensing\nstudies with CMB.\nAs discussed earlier, our calculation on the lensing effect on background clustering power spectrum may be incomplete. Since the typical deflection angle\nis of order an arcminute and there is substantial clustering power at arcminute\nscales, it is necessary that one properly accounts for higher order corrections\nto the previous calculations. We have attempted this numerically and show\nthe first and second order contributions in Fig. 3. Unlike the case with CMB\nanisotropies, where the second order contribution was lower than the first order term, at angular scales of arcminutes and below, we find that this to be\nno longer the case here. In the multipole range of interest, however, we expect\nthere to be no substantial contribution from the second and other higher order terms, though if we were to study the lensing corrections to the clustering\npower spectrum at arcsecond angular scales, then it may be necessary to perform an improved calculation. We restrict to arcminute scale clustering here\nsince such clustering may easily be detectable in near future. On the other\nhand, even if clustering at arcsecond angular scales is detected, we expect at\nsuch angular scales, the shot-noise associated with finite density of sources\nthat contribute to the background emission to be the dominant contribution\nto clustering. In Fig. 3, for illustration, we show the expected shot-noise related to the IR background generated by first stars and galaxies following\ncalculations in Cooray et al (2003).\nWhile we have specifically discussed the lensing modification to the IR background generated by first stars, our conclusions apply to clustering aspects\nof all other backgrounds. As argued earlier, for backgrounds at the same redshift range, one expects a similar shape to the angular power spectrum though\nthe amplitude is different for obvious reasons. Our calculation related to the\nlensing modification of the background fluctuation power spectrum is independent of its amplitude and the difference between the lensed and unlensed\npower spectra scales accordingly such that the fractional difference between\nthe two remain the same. The only differences are, however, associated with\nsecondary considerations such as the extent to which shot-noise related to the\nfinite density of sources that contribute to each of these backgrounds may\nbecome a source of confusion noise for lensing reconstruction.\n15\n\n\f10\n\n\u22128\n\nCMB\n\u221210\n\nsed\nlen\n\nl(l+1)Cl /2\u03c0\n\n10\n\n\u221212\n\n10\n\n\u221214\n\n10\n\nR\n\nCosmic\nVar.\n\n2\n\nR\n\u221216\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\nl\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nFig. 2. The lensed CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum. The curves labeled\n'R' and 'R2 ' show the lensing calculation up to the first- and second-order in Cl\u03c6 ,\nrespectively. Note that typical calculations in the literature involve the first order\ncalculation, while the next-order correction considered here, the R2 contribution, is\nat the level of 30% and below and can be ignored for most practical purposes; for\nprecision cosmology, where lensing information is used to extract cosmological parameters, such higher order corrections must be accounted for and we illustrate this\nwhy by showing the cosmic variance limit (line labled 'Cosmic Var.') of the power\nspectrum measurements at each of these multipoles with a full-sky experiment.\n\n2.3 Lensing Reconstruction from the Diffuse Emission\n\nAs a first approach, one can consider a lensing reconstruction using diffuse\nbackground anisotropy data similar to that suggested for CMB. The idea\nbehind here is the presence of a significant non-Gaussian signal in the form\nof a trispectrum, and an approach to probe this non-Gaussianity based on\nquadratic statistics such the power spectrum of CMB-gradients (Zaldarriaga\n& Seljak 1999; Hu 2001; Hirata & Seljak 2003). Here, we make use of the\ndiscussion in Cooray & Kesden (2003; see, also, Hu 2001; Hu & Okamoto\n2002). Under gravitational lensing, the trispectrum for diffuse backgrounds\ntakes the form of\n\nT\u0303 I (l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 ) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ndrCl\u03b4I3 Cl\u03b4I4 C|l\u03c6\u03c61 +l3 | (r)(l1 + l3 ) * l3 (l1 + l3 ) * l4\ni\n\n+C|l\u03c6\u03c62+l3 | (r)(l2 + l3 ) * l3 (l2 + l3 ) * l4 + Perm. ,\n16\n\n(23)\n\n\f2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nse\n\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n10\n\nl(l+1)Cl /2\u03c0\n\ni\nno\n\not\n\nsh\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nR\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\nn\n\nificatio\n\nmagn\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n2\n\nR\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\nl\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFig. 3. The clustering power spectrum of a diffuse background at near-IR wavelengths due to first stars and galaxies and at redshifts between 10 and 30. The\ndotted line shows the intrinsic angular power spectrum, while the correction related\nto gravitational lensing is shown with a dashed line. The solid line is the angular\npower spectrum one observes today; at large angular scales, this power spectrum\nis few percent larger than the intrinsic power spectrum while the differences are\ninsignificant at arcminute angular scales. The dashed line shows an estimate on the\nshot-noise contribution to the clustering signal when integrated over the finite number density of background sources; for diffuse emissions such as 21cm line from the\ngeneral IGM prior to reionization, we expect this shot-noise to be significantly lower\nor non-existent. The curves labeled 'R' and 'R2 ' show the first and second-order\ncontributions related to the lensing calculation. The curve labeled 'magnification'\nis an estimate on the magnification-related correction to the power spectrum when\na finite number density of sources is involved and the background is studied after\nremoving certain resolved bright sources.\n\nwhere the permutations contain 5 additional terms with the replacement of\n(l3 , l4 ) pair by other combination of pairs. The derivation related to Eq. 23 can\nbe found in Cooray & Kesden (2003), though, we have modified it slightly to\naccount for the finite width in the background source distribution by including\nan explicit integral over the radial distribution. The lensing extraction make\nuse of this trispectrum based on the fact that it is simply proportional to Cl\u03c6\u03c6 .\nIn practice, one makes an estimator for the deflection angle based on quadratic\nstatistics. In the present case, when compared to CMB, note that the one estimates a weighted average of the deflection angle over the redshift distribution\nof sources that contribute to the diffuse emission. The estimator is such that,\n17\n\n\f\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n4\n\n00\n11\n\n\u03c6\u03c6\n\nl Cl /2\u03c0\n\n10\n\n15\nz~\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u22129\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\nl\nFig. 4. The extraction of lensing information from clustering data related to the diffuse background. The solid lines show the power spectrum of projected potentials\nwhile the dotted line show the expected noise associated with the lensing reconstruction. Here, we show the case at z \u223c 15, based on, for example, IR background\nfrom first stars and galaxies, or 21 cm emission from neutral Hydrogen, while, for\ncomparison, we also show the case with CMB using, for example,e arcminute scale\nresolution data expected from a mission such as CMBpol. In comparison, CMB\ntemperature fluctuations allow a significantly better reconstruction related to gravitational lensing than low redshift backgrounds and is primarily due to the difference\nin the fluctuation pattern on the sky or the clustering power spectrum. The presence\nof features and the lack of power at arcminute scales in CMB anisotropies enhance\nthe lensing modification, while in the case of diffuse backgrounds, the lensing modifications are minor and the generated non-Gaussianities are no significant.\n\nin Fourier space, one is convolving two filtered versions of the background\nintensity fluctuations\nI\u02c62 (l) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 l1\n \u0303 I(l\n \u0303 \u2212 l1 ) ,\nW (l, l1 )I(l)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere W is a filter that is designed to optimally extract information related\nto the weak lensing effect such that the power spectrum of I\u02c62 (l) returns hCl\u03c6 i\nwhere\nhCl\u03c6 i\n\n=\n\nR\n\ndrCl\u03c6 (r)Cl\u03b4I\nR\n=\ndrCl\u03b4I\n\nZ\n\ndrn2s (r)Cl\u03c6 (r) ,\n\n18\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere ns (r) is the normalized distribution of background sources that contribute to the diffuse emission. The filter, W (l, l1 ), can be represented by\ntypical quadratic combinations considered in the literature, such as gradients\n(e.g., Zaldarriaga & Seljak 1999). To extract all information, following the case\nin CMB anisotropies, the optimized filter to extract lensing information takes\nthe form of\nW (l, l1 ) =\n\n[l * l1 Cl1 + l * (l \u2212 l1 )C|l\u2212l1| ]\n,\ntot\n2Cltot\nC|l\u2212l\n|\n1\n1\n\n(26)\n\nsuch that when one constructs Nl2 hI\u02c62 (l)I\u02c62 (l\u2032 )i one measures hCl\u03c6 i with a noise\ncontribution given by\n\uf8ee\n\nNl = \uf8f0\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f9\u22121\n\nd2 l1 [l * l1 Cl1 + l * (l \u2212 l1 )C|l\u2212l1| ]2 \uf8fb\ntot\n(2\u03c0)2\n2Cltot\nC|l\u2212l\n1\n1|\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nHere Cltot is the total contribution to the angular power spectrum of the diffuse\nbackground map and includes contributions such as Cltot = C\u0303l +Clshot +Clmag +\nClnoise , which are related to the unlensed clustering power spectrum including\nany shot-noise, C\u0303l +Clshot , any corrections related to the magnification, if again\nthere is a finite number density of sources involved Clmag and instrumental\nnoise, Clnoise .\nThe shot-noise associated with a finite density of sources that determine the\nbackground emission can be estimated through number counts, dN/dS, of the\ncontributing sources, as a function of flux S, and can be written as\nClshot\n\n=\n\nS\nZcut\n0\n\nS2\n\ndN\ndS ,\ndS\n\n(28)\n\nwhere Scut is the flux cut off value related to the removal of resolved sources.\nThis shot-noise acts as a source of noise for lensing reconstruction. Unlike the\ncalculation related to the clustering spectrum, where the average emissivity\nis the only unknown, the shot-noise depends strongly on detailed aspects of\nsource number counts. Since one weighs by a factor S 2 , the shot-noise is more\nsensitive to rare objects which are brighter. Since there are many uncertainties\nrelated to establishing the source number counts precisely, we loosely estimate\nthis following Cooray et al. (2003) and show this estimate in Fig. 3 for the case\nof IR-background generated by first stars and galaxies. Note that for \"truly\"\ndiffuse emissions, such as the 21 cm rest-wavelength background from general\nIGM and CMB, this is not a concern.\nNote that, so far, we have considered the case where the clustering analysis\n19\n\n\ftakes in to account all contributions to the background. In some situations,\nsuch as in cases where some part of the background is due to resolved sources\nin data, one can study clustering properties by removing such sources from\nthe analysis. While we do not expect this to be the case either with nearIR background from first objects or in 21 cm emission, most dusty galaxies\nthat contribute to the far-IR background can be resolved and removed. In\nsuch a case, the clustering power spectrum of the residual emission contain a\ncorrection associated with lensing magnification (Tegmark & Villumsen 1997)\nand can be written as\nClshot\n\n=l\n\n4\n\n4\nhCl\u03c6\u03c6 iScut\n\n\"\n\ndN\ndS\n\n#2\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nScut\n\nThis noise contribution depends on the number counts at the flux-cut off.\nIf this contribution can be identified, it alone may be used for a lensing\nstudy though the modification to the power spectrum is expected to be small.\nThough we make an estimate of the contribution in Fig. 3 (curve labeled\n'magnification'), this estimate should also be considered as highly uncertain\nsince number counts of sources that contribute to the background are not well\ndefined in the context of backgrounds we have primarily considered. This effect is again only present in the case of a finite density of sources and is not\na concern when, for example, all sources that contribute to the background\nhave the same flux.\nIn addition to effects related to a finite density of sources that lead to a\ndiffuse background, the presence of instrumental noise also affect the lensing\nreconstruction. This noise is given by\nCln = fsky w \u22121 el\n\n2 \u03c32\nb\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\n2\nwhen fsky is the fraction of sky surveyed, w \u22121 = 4\u03c0\u03c3pix\n/Npix is the variance\n2\nper unit are on the sky with an individual pixel noise variance of \u03c3pix\nwith\nNpix pixels, and \u03c3b is the effective beam-width of the instrument.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we illustrate the extent to which CMB and low redshift diffuse\nbackgrounds can be used for a lensing reconstruction by concentrating on the\nexpected level of noise associated with the reconstructed potential power spectrum. For simplicity, here we consider arcminute scale resolution experiments,\nbut set the noise level to be ten orders of magnitude below the clustering power\nspectrum such that at multipoles of few hundred, the noise-level is insignificant. This is done to consider the full extent to which diffuse backgrounds\ncan be used for lensing studies based on clustering information and to compare with CMB related lensing studies. As shown in Fig. 4, CMB data allow\nan order of magnitude or better reconstruction of the projected lensing po20\n\n\ftential power spectrum when compared to the case with diffuse backgrounds.\nThis is due reasons we have already mentioned and involve the fact that the\nnon-Gaussianity generated in CMB data, by the nature of its fluctuation pattern, is more significant than the non-Gaussianity generated by gravitational\nlensing in the low redshift diffuse emission. While fluctuations in the diffuse\nemission may allow a reconstruction of the lensing power spectrum with a\ncumulative signal-to-noise ratio of order few hundred, this should be compared to at least an order of magnitude better reconstruction with CMB with\nthe same angular resolution and fractionally the same noise level. Unlike low\nredshift backgrounds, CMB also has the advantage that a lensing reconstruction can be considered from polarization information in addition to temperature anisotropies we have only considered here (e.g., Guzik et al. 2001; Hu &\nOkamoto 2002).\nIn addition to problems related to the reconstruction, there are also reasons\nthat can complicate a simple interpretation of the reconstructed lensing power\nspectrum. For example, in addition to the lensing contributions we have discussed, the lensed clustering power spectrum also contains additional contributions related to the fact that the source distribution that contribute to low\nredshift background is broad and these lensing potentials can be correlated\nwith the diffuse emission itself. We write the dominant contribution associated with such a cross-correlated component as\n\nClconf\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd2 l1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\ndr1 Cl\u03c6\u2212\u03b4I\n(r1 )\n1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u2212\u03b4I\n(r2 )[(l \u2212 l1 ) * l1 ]2 .\ndr2 C|l\u2212l\n1|\n\n(31)\n\nThis term does not exist in the case of CMB since the potentials that deflect\nCMB photons are disjoint in redshift space from last scattering surface where\nmost CMB fluctuations are generated. In the case of diffuse backgrounds, if\nthe source distribution is broad, this term can be interpreted simply as the\ncontribution due to lensing potentials at the low end of the source distribution\nthat is responsible for the lensing of sources at the other end of the distribution.\nAssuming that both potentials and the sources of background light anisotropy\ntrace the same power spectrum P (k), with a bias factor b(k, r2 ) that accounts\nfor any departures from this assumption, this cross power spectrum can be\nwritten as\n\nCl\u03c6\u2212\u03b4I (rs ) =\n\nZ\u221e\nZrs\n2Z 2\nlen\n(32)\nk dkP (k) drW (k, r1 )jl (kr1 ) dr2 b(k, r2 )b(k, r2 )jl (kr\n2) .\n\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\nA proper accounting of effects such as this will be a necessary aspect of any\nstudy that attempt to use background source clustering for lensing purposes.\nWhile a reconstruction with CMB is better, note that one reconstructs the\n21\n\n\fpotential power spectrum out to a redshift of 1100. Thus, low redshift backgrounds are still useful for cosmological studies since they allow a reconstruction out to redshifts of 15 to 30 or so and will bridge the gap between low\nredshift lensing studies, based on galaxy shapes, and eventual lensing studies\nwith higher resolution CMB data in the near future. In this respect, we suggest that one should concentrate further on the aspects of lensing related to\ndiffuse backgrounds and how they can be exploited. As we have discussed, the\nuse of non-Gaussian information for a lensing reconstruction with low redshift\nbackgrounds, in the same manner lensing studies with CMB are proposed, is\nnot helpful, though an attempt is still encouraged. To extract lensing information, one should concentrate on the distribution of sources, that contribute\nto the background emission, at arcsecond angular scales. One approach would\nbe to use the local anisotropy of the correlation function to obtain an estimate for the shear (van Waerbeke et al. 1997); this comes from the fact while\nclustering properties of the background is expected to isotropic, in addition to\nnon-Gaussianities, gravitational lensing also modify the clustering such that,\nlocally, an anisotropic correlation function is generated. The quadrupole moment of the local correlation function captures this anisotropy and provides an\nestimate of shear just as ellipticity is used to estimate lensing shear. Another\napproach is to use variations in number counts due to lensing magnification\nrelated effects (Jain 2002), though this requires backgrounds where sources\ncounts are easily modified by magnification due to the nature of source count\ndistribution as a function of redshift. While we have primarily discussed the\nuse of arcminute scale clustering information and the potential presence of\nnon-Gaussianities for a lensing reconstruction, in a future paper, we will return to the issue of extracting lensing shear from small angular scale clustering\nproperties.\n\n3\n\nSummary\n\nThe current weak lensing measurements of the large scale structure are mostly\nrelated to statistical study of background galaxy ellipticities. We consider a\npossibility to extend lensing studies with intrinsically unresolved sources and\nsuggest that clustering properties, at arcminute angular scales, of either the\npoint sources or the integrated diffuse emission from these point sources can\nbe used for a lensing reconstruction. This is analogous to techniques now developed to extract lensing information from cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations and relies on the presence\nof a significant non-Gaussian signal in the background generated by the gravitational lensing modifications to the fluctuation pattern. Contrary to CMB,\nhowever, the lensing modification to the diffuse background clustering is minimal and results from the lack of distinct features in the fluctuation pattern.\n22\n\n\fIn the case of CMB, a distinct signature or pattern exist through the acoustic\nnature and the lack of intrinsic power at arcminute angular scales where the\ndamping-tail is found. We have discussed the extent to which projected matter\npower spectrum be reconstructed with images of the diffuse background generated by first stars and galaxies in near-IR wavelengths and the background\nrelated to 21 cm emission by neutral gas in the general intergalactic medium\nprior to reionization and have shown this to be significantly below the level\nof signal-to-noise ratio one can reach with, in relative terms, CMB data. This\nis due to the lack of significant non-Gaussianities in the diffuse emission that\nis generated by gravitational lensing modifications. Though limited, lensing\nstudies with diffuse backgrounds will only be the way to extend the reconstruction of the integrated matter power spectrum out to redshifts of 15 to\n30 and to bridge the gap between current and upcoming lensing studies with\nsources at redshifts between 1 and 2 and planned weak lensing studies with\nCMB out to the last scattering surface at a redshift of 1100. As ways to improve, we suggest further studying a potential lensing reconstruction methods\nbased on shear estimation from the local anisotropy of the correlation function of the sources that contribute to diffuse backgrounds and statistics that\nare optimized to extract information related to modifications associated with\nlensing magnification.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks Roger Blandford, Marc Kamionkowski, and Michael Kesden for useful discussions and collaborative work.
