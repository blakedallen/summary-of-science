In [6] H.Kaji proved that\nif \u03c6 is unramified then the tangent line to the general point does not meet again\nthe curve. This gives a partial answer to a problem posed by A.Terracini in a paper\nof 1932 [10]. Our paper is a sort of revival of the beautiful Kaji's argument, which\nis by way of contradiction. The proof of [6] splits in two parts. In the first part\none proves the existence of a flex point on \u03c6(C) such that the tangent line deforms\nto a trisecant tangent line; the associated infinitesimal condition provides simpler\nequations. We noticed that this procedure realizes a non-trivial reduction of the\nproblem to the case of some special rational curves. This perspective allows us to\ngeneralize the viewpoint. In fact in [6] the author considered only curves C \u2282 P3\n0\n\nPartially supported by 1) PRIN 2005 \"Spazi di moduli e teoria di Lie\"; 2) Indam Gnsaga; 3)\nFar 2006 (PV): Variet\u00e0 algebriche, calcolo algebrico, grafi orientati e topologici.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n2\n\nsuch that the normalization morphism C \u2032 \u2192 C is unramified, whereas we allow also\nsome ramification. More precisely, the curves that we will study are of the following\ntype.\nDefinition 0.1. We say that \u03c6 : C \u2192 Pn is locally toric if for any point of C, there\nare n positive relatively prime integers ai , i = 1, ..., n, such that 0 < ai < ai+1 and a\nlocal analytical parametrization of \u03c6 of the form:\n(ta1 , ..., tan ).\n\n(1)\n\nRemark 0.2. By relatively prime integers ai we always mean that (a1 , ..., an ) = 1\nas an ideal of Z.\nWe will often speak of a locally toric curve when referring to a curve with a locally\ntoric morphism to a projective space Pn . We remark that locally toric with a1 = 1\nmeans exactly that the normalization is unramified. Furthermore the affine curve\nin (1) has a natural toric action. Our first main result is the following:\nTheorem 0.3. Let C be a connected smooth complete algebraic curve. If \u03c6 : C \u2192 P3\nis a morphism birational onto its image that is locally toric then the tangent line to\nthe general point does not meet again the curve.\nThe second part in [6] is more computational and it relies on a classical, non-trivial\nresult of Enestr\u00f6m and Kakeya [7] about the zeros of a polynomial with real coefficients. We find a completely elementary proof of a more general result as an\napplication of Rolle's theorem. Furthermore we remark that in the case of locally\ntoric curves the computation reduces to counting the integer zeroes of an exponential\ndiophantine equation.\nThe paper is organized in the folllowing way. In section 1 we prove our basic lemma.\nIn section 2 we perform the Kaji reduction. As it was already pointed out by Kaji\nby giving explicit examples in positive characteristic, the hypothesis of working in\ncharacteristic zero is essential. In fact if the general tangent line were a trisecant\nthen the principal parts bundle P 1 of OC (1) would split, which is impossible in\ncharacteristic zero. The technical problem in our case is that, while Kaji used the\nprincipal parts bundle, we need to build a vector bundle that is a sub-sheaf of the\nprincipal parts bundle of C. In the third section we discuss some applications of\nthe same methods, studying the problem of whether the span of the tangent lines at\ntwo general points of a locally toric curve in P4 containes the tangent line to a third\npoint. Then we discuss a more general \"dual problem\" concerning the osculating\nlinear spaces to a couple of general points. Finally in section 4 we consider the\nproblem of whether the (n \u2212 2)-linear osculating space at a general point of a locally\ntoric curve in Pn intersects again the curve. If g < 2, under some mild technical\nassumptions (see Thm. 0.5) we are able to reduce this problem to that of calculating\nthe rank of the following n \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix, where z \u2208 C.\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\na1 a21 . . . a1n\u22122 z a1 \u2212 1\n\uf8ec a2 a22 . . . a2n\u22122 z a2 \u2212 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(2)\nAa1 ,a2 ,...,an (z) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed. . . . . . . . . . . .\n... \uf8f8\nan a2n . . . ann\u22122 z an \u2212 1\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n3\n\nIn fact the general (n \u2212 2)-linear osculating space does not intersect again the curve\nif and only if the rank of matrix 2 is n \u2212 1, for z 6= 1. We will call anomalous\n(see Definition 1.3 and 1.4) a n-plet of relatively prime integers 0 < a1 < * * * < an\nsuch that Aa1 ,...,an (z) has rank smaller than n \u2212 1 for some z 6= 1 and anomalous\nlocally toric curve a locally toric curve with an anomalous n-plets of exponents in\nits parametrization.\nRemark 0.4. In the appendix to this paper [3], Pietro Corvaja and Umberto Zannier\nprove, via methods related to the paper [2], that there exists only a finite (possibly\nzero) number of anomalous 4-plets 0 < a1 < * * * < a4 of integers. In particular they\nfind an explicit bound for a4 thus reducing the problem of finding anomalous 4-plets\nto a finite number of verifications. They believe that the same property of finiteness\ncan be proved for every n. Moreover they give an algorithm, that could be performed\nby a calculator, to explicitly compute all anomalous 4-plets, but this has not been\ndone yet. Performing this algorithm would answer the question of the existence of\nsuch 4-plets, proving Conjecture 1.2 that we state in Section 1.\nA (partial) answer to the problem of (n \u2212 2)-osculating spaces is our second main\nresult. Let P n the bundle of principal parts of order n, we have the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 0.5. Let C \u2282 Pn = PV be a locally toric curve and g(C) = 0 or 1. If\ng(C) = 1, we suppose moreover that the natural evaluation map\nevn\u22122 : V \u2212\u2192 P n\u22122\nis surjective. Then, if C is not anomalous, the general osculating (n \u2212 2)-plane does\nnot intersect the curve in a second point different from the osculating one.\nWe remark that, despite this generalization, the case of singular curves is still widely\nopen. We can formulate the following:\nConjecture 0.6. Let X \u2282 P3 be a non-degenerate singular complex curve. Then\nthe general tangent line does not meet again the curve.\nMoreover, from the enumerative point of view, the problem of tangent lines intersecting again the curve C \u2282 P3 has been studied in [9], where the number of such\nlines is given, once one supposes that it is finite. We believe that section 1.2 of this\npaper could open interesting perspectives under an enumerative point of view as\nwell.\nThe arithmetic part of section 4 relies heavily on the results by P.Corvaja and\nU.Zannier contained in the appendix [3]. We would like to thank Enrico Schlesinger\nfor many fruitful conversations, Pietro Corvaja and Umberto Zannier for the intense\nand interesting E-mail correspondence we had while writing this paper.\nAdded in Proof: We have been kindly informed by J.Starr that Theorem 0.3 has\nbeen proved indipendently with similar techniques by I.Coskun, N.Elkies, G. Farkas,\nJ.Harris and J.Starr. Moreover they show that Theorem 0.3 is no longer true if one\nconsiders analytic arcs.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n1\n1.1\n\n4\n\nRanks of polynomial matrices.\nAn elementary lemma\n\nLet a, b and c be positive integers, with 0 < a < b < c. let f = GCD(a, b, c), note\nthat f = 1 if and only if the numbers are relatively prime. We take z in the complex\nnumbers field. Let us consider now the matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na za \u2212 1\nA(z) = \uf8ed b z b \u2212 1 \uf8f8\n(3)\nc zc \u2212 1\nIf we define v(z) := (z a , z b , z c ), u := (1, 1, 1) and w := (a, b, c), we have that A(z)\nhas rank 1 when v \u2212 u is proportional to w.\nLemma 1.1. The rank of A(z) is 1 if and only if z f = 1.\nProof. If the rank of A(z) is 1, both the real and the immaginary part of (z a \u22121, z b \u2212\n1, z c \u2212 1) have to be proportional to w. We have :\nRe v = \u03bbw + u; Im v = \u03b3w,\nwith \u03bb and \u03b3 \u2208 R. If we can prove that \u03bb = \u03b3 = 0, this would imply v = u, that is\nz a = z b = z c = 1.\nThis in turn would mean that z f = 1.\nLet \u03c1 = |z| be the modulus of z if the rank of the matrix A(z) is one then we have\nz a = \u03bba + 1 + i\u03b3a. This means that \u03c12a = (\u03bba + 1)2 + \u03b3 2 a2 and the same computation\nholds for b and c. This allows us to say that the following function\nf : R \u2212\u2192 R,\nx 7\u2192 \u03c12x \u2212 ((\u03bbx + 1)2 + \u03b3 2 x2 ),\nhas 4 distinct zeroes at a, b, c, and 0. The third derivative f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) has then the\nfollowing expression:\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) = (2log\u03c1)3 \u03c12x .\nThe function f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) is rational over R and by its analytical expression it is clear it\nhas no zeroes if \u03c1 6= 1. If f has 4 zeroes, by Rolle's theorem, f \u2032\u2032\u2032 should have at least\n1 zero. This means that \u03c1 = 1 and f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) is identically zero. Moreover we get that\nf (x) = x(x(\u03b3 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ) \u2212 \u03bb).\n\n(4)\n\nEquation 4 implies that for \u03bb, \u03b3 6= 0 f has at most 2 zeroes but f has 4 zeroes in\n0, a, b, c. This implies that \u03bb = \u03b3 = 0. The converse is clear.\nWe notice that the previous lemma for a = 1 was proven in [6]. A possible generalization is the following conjecture.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n5\n\nConjecture 1.2. Let 0 < a1 < a2 < . . . an be postive integers. Set f := GCD(a1 , . . . , an ),\nthen the n \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\na1 a21 . . . a1n\u22122 z a1 \u2212 1\n\uf8ec a2 a22 . . . a2n\u22122 z a2 \u2212 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(5)\nAa1 ,a2 ,...,an (z) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed. . . . . . . . . . . .\n... \uf8f8\nan a2n . . . ann\u22122 z an \u2212 1\nshould have rank smaller than n \u2212 1 if and only if z f = 1.\nThe computation of this rank reduces to finding the number of positive integer zeroes\nof an equation of the following type\nz x = p(x),\nwhere z \u2208 C is fixed and p(x) is a polynomial.\nWe remark that this generalization would open the way towards more general results\non, for instance higher osculating spaces on varieties of dimension bigger than one.\nA particular case of Conjecture 1.2 appears in [4], where the case n = 4 is treated.\nIn the paper [4] the calculation are performed by MAPLE but we must confess that\nwe could not decide if this process is correct.\nWe close this section giving two definitions related to Conjecture 1.2.\nDefinition 1.3. A n-plet 0 < a1 < * * * < an of integers satisfying the condition\nGCD(a1 , . . . , an ) = 1 such that there exists a z 6= 1 such that Aa1 ,...,an (z) has rank\nsmaller than n \u2212 1 is called an anomalous n-plet.\nDefinition 1.4. A locally toric curve \u03c6 : C \u2192 Pn such that the n-plet defining its\nlocal parametrization is anomalous is called an anomalous locally toric curve.\n\n1.2\n\nRational curves\n\nIn this section we give a geometric interpretation of Lemma 1.1.\nConsider the affine rationally parametrized curve in C3\nB := {v(z) = (z a , z b , z c ), z \u2208 C}.\nThe only singular point of B if a > 1 is the origin. We have v(1) = u = (1, 1, 1).\nLet us consider the tangent line L to the curve at u \u2208 B. We have that\nL := {u + tw}\nwhere t \u2208 C and w is like in the preceding section. Let us suppose that L has\nanother point of intersection with the curve B and let us call it v(z\u0303). The secant\nline to B passing by u and v(z\u0303) is\n(1 \u2212 t)u + tv(z\u0303) = u + t(v(z\u0303) \u2212 u),\nfor t \u2208 C. This is the line L if and only if v(z\u0303) \u2212 u and w are proportional, that\nis, using the notation of lemma 1.1, A(z\u0303) has rank 1. This means that Lemma 1.1\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n6\n\nassures that, since z\u0303 6= 1, for such a curve with GCD(a, b, c) = 1 the tangent line at\n(1, 1, 1) is not a trisecant.\nMoreover we can make the following observation. Let us consider the following\nmorphism\n\u03bc : C \u2212\u2192 C3 ,\nx 7\u2192 (xa , xb , xc ).\nPerforming for \u03bb \u2208 C, \u03bb 6= 0 the affine transformation\n\u03c4 : C \u2212\u2192 C\nz 7\u2192 \u03bb\u22121 z\non the affine line and\n\u03b4 : C3 \u2212\u2192 C3\n(z1 , z2 , z3 ) 7\u2192 (\u03bb\u2212a z1 , \u03bb\u2212b z2 , \u03bb\u2212c z3 )\non C3 , we remark that the following diagram commutes.\n\u03bc\n\nC \u2212\u2192 C3\n\u03c4\u2193\n\u2193\u03b4\n\u03bc\nC \u2212\u2192 C3\nThis implies that the tangent line at any smooth point p \u2208 B does not intersect B\noutside p.\nWe remark that the projective curve B \u2282 P3 such that B is its restriction to an\naffine open set is the image of the following morphism\nP1 \u2212\u2192 P3 ,\n[t : z] 7\u2192 [tc : z a tc\u2212a : z b tc\u2212b : z c ].\nThis means that set-theoretically we have that B = B \u222a s, where s = (0, 0, 0, 1).\n\n2\n\nKaji reduction\n\nLet C be a connected smooth complete algebraic curve and let\n\u03c6 : C \u2192 P3\nbe a morphism birational onto its image.

Let us then consider the image\nsheaf E := Im(ev): we have that E \u2282 P 1 as a subsheaf but E is also a globally\ngenerated rank 2 vector bundle. Let now OS(\u03c6) be the skyscraper sheaf supported\non the ramification locus of \u03c6, then we have the following exact sequence.\n0 \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 P 1 \u2212\u2192 OS(\u03c6) \u2212\u2192 0\nFurthermore we have the following commutative diagram\n0\n0\n\u2193\n\u2193\n0 \u2192\nM\n\u2192\nE\n\u2192 OC (1) \u2192 0\n\u2193\n\u2193\nk\n0 \u2192 \u03a91C \u2297 OC (1) \u2192 P 1 \u2192 OC (1) \u2192 0\n\u2193\n\u2193\nOS(\u03c6)\nOS(\u03c6)\n\u2193\n\u2193\n0\n0\n\n(8)\n\nfor some line bundle M. Let PE be the projective bundle associated to E.

We have a map\n\u03bd : PE \u2212\u2192 P3 .\nProof. We recall from diagram 6 that we have a surjection\nOP3 \u2297 V \u0589 P 1\nthat gives us four global sections of P 1 . Let \u03c0 : PE \u2192 C the natural projection and\nlet us pull-back diagram 8 via \u03c0. Then we recall that \u03c0 \u2217 E is a globally generated\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n8\n\nsubsheaf of \u03c0 \u2217 P 1 . Let S be the tautological vector bundle over PE, we are now in\nthe following situation over PE.\n\u22954\nOPE\n\u2193\n\u2217\n0 \u2192 S \u2192 \u03c0 E \u2192 OPE \u2217 (1) \u2192 0\n\u22954\nThis implies that the four sections of OPE\nsurject to OPE \u2217 (1). Since \u03c0 \u2217 E is globally\ngenerated, also OPE \u2217 (1) is globally generated, thus giving us the map we were looking\nfor.\n\nLet us consider the map we have just defined. Let us call Y \u2282 P3 the image of \u03bd,\nset theoretically Y is the closure of the union of tangent lines of C. This surface is\nknown in the literature as the tangential surface of C.\nLemma 2.2. Let G an algebraic complex curve and L a line bundle on G. Let P 1 (L)\nbe the bundle of principal parts of L of first order, and let e \u2208 H 1 (G, \u03a91G ) be the\nextension class defined by the natural exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a91G \u2297 L \u2212\u2192 P 1 (L) \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0.\nThen we have c1 (L) = \u2212e. In particular, P 1 (L) is the unique non-trivial extension\nof L by \u03a91G \u2297 L.\nProof. See [1].\nLet us now consider diagram 8. Twisting by OC (\u22121) and passing to cohomology we\nget a map\n\u03b1 : H 1 (C, M(\u22121)) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C, \u03a91C )\nWe remark that both spaces can be interpreted as parameter spaces for extension\nclasses.\nProposition 2.3. Let\n\u03b1 : H 1 (C, M(\u22121)) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C, \u03a91C )\nbe the natural map between extension classes and let a be the extension class of the\nfirst row of diagram 8. Then \u03b1(a) = e.\nProof. Let us twist by OC (\u22121) diagram 8. We have a new diagram like the following.\n0\n0\n\u2193\n\u2193\n0 \u2192 M(\u22121) \u2192 E(\u22121) \u2192 OC \u2192 0\n\u2193\n\u2193\nk\n0 \u2192\n\u03a91C\n\u2192 P 1 (\u22121) \u2192 OC \u2192 0\n\u2193\n\u2193\nOS(\u03c6)\nOS(\u03c6)\n\u2193\n\u2193\n0\n0\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n9\n\nWe remark that M(\u22121) \u223c\n= \u03a91C (\u2212S(\u03c6). If we take cohomology we find the following\ncommutative square.\nH 0 (C, OC ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C, M(\u22121))\nk\n\u03b1\u2193\n0\n1\nH (C, OC ) \u2212\u2192\nH (C, \u03a91C )\nThis implies directly the statement.\nRemark that Proposition 2.3 implies that if E were the trivial extension, then also\nP 1 would split.\nDefinition 2.4. A projective curve \u03c6 : C \u2192 Pn is tangentially degenerate if, for a\ngeneral point P \u2208 \u03c6(C), there exists another point Q \u2208 \u03c6(C) that lies on the tangent\nline to \u03c6(C) at P .\nLet us consider now the map\n\u03c1 : C \u00d7 C \u2212\u2192 C \u00d7 P3 ,\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (p, \u03c6(q)),\n\nand let us denote C0 the image of diagonal \u2206 via \u03c1.\nMoreover, let \u03c0 : PE \u2212\u2192 C be the natural projection, we define a map\n\u03c3 : PE \u2212\u2192 C \u00d7 P3\nas the product map \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03bd. Let us denote by A the section of PE corresponding to\nthe surjection E \u2192 OC (1). Remark that we have \u03c3 \u22121 (C0 ) = A. Then let D \u2282 C \u00d7C\nbe the following subset:\nD := {(h, s) \u2208 C \u00d7 C \\ C0 : t\u03c6(h) = s\u03c6(h),\u03c6(s) }.\n\n(9)\n\nIf a curve C is tangentially degenerate then D has positive dimension. Moreover in\nthis case \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c1(D)) \u2282 PE is an effective divisor in the projective bundle. Now we\nneed to recall the following Proposition.\nProposition 2.5. Let C be a curve, let E be a rank 2 vector bundle over C, and\nlet L be a line bundle over C. Let N be a section of the ruled surface PE \u2192 C\ncorresponding to a surjection E \u2192 L. If there exists an effective divisor F on PE\nsuch that N and F are disjoint, then the surjection E \u2192 L splits\nProof. See [6].\nFurthermore, by combining Lemma 2.2 with Proposition 2.5, we get the following\nCorollary.\nCorollary 2.6. Let \u03c6 : C \u2192 P3 be a projective space curve. If C is tangentially\ndegenerate, then the section A of PE \u2192 C intersects every component of the curve\n\u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c1(D)) \u2282 PE.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n10\n\nThe key point here is that if a component does not intersect A then the vector\nbundle E splits, which is not the case.\nProposition 2.7. Let C be a non degenerate complex projective algebraic curve\nthat is locally toric and let \u03c6 : C \u0592\u2192 P3 be the morphism in question. Then C is not\ntangentially degenerate.\nProof. We suppose by contradiction that dim(D) > 0. Let D be the closure of D in\nC \u00d7 C. We assume that D does contain an irreducible complete curve X. Let X\u0303 be\nthe normalization of X and \u03c8 : X\u0303 \u2192 C \u00d7 C be the induced map. By Corollary 2.6\n\u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c1(D)) \u2229 A 6= \u2205. This is equivalent to saying that D \u2229 \u2206 6= \u2205, hence there exists\np \u2208 X\u0303 and q \u2208 C such that\n\u03c8(p) = (\u03c81 (p), \u03c82 (p)) = (q, q).\nWe take now two local analytical parameters: respectively, t on an open set containing q \u2208 C and x on an open neighbourhood of p \u2208 X\u0303. We take t and x such\nthat:\n1) t(q) = x(p) = 0;\n2) \u03c8(x) = (\u03c81 (x), \u03c82 (x)) = (xr , xs (k + xg(x)), for a scalar k 6= 0 and a function\ng regular in a neighourhood of zero.\nWe can also make a choice of the coordinates of P3 and of the open set where the\nparameter is t such that we have \u03c6(0) = (1, 0, 0, 0) and such that in affine coordinates\nwe have:\n\u03c6(t) = (ta , tb + tb+1 \u03b1(t), tc + tc+1 \u03b2(t))\nwhere 0 < a < b < c, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are functions regular at zero.\nComposing \u03c6 with \u03c81 and \u03c82 , the two components of \u03c8, we have the following\nparametrized curves:\n\u03b3(x) = (xar , xbr + x(b+1)r \u03b1(xr ), xcr + x(c+1)r \u03b1(xr )),\n\u03b7(x) = (k a xas + higher terms), k b xbs + higher terms, k c xcs + higher terms),\n\nwhere higher terms stands for the terms of higher degree.\nLet \u03b3 \u2032 (x) be the first derivative of \u03b3, then we have:\n\u03b3 \u2032 (x) = (arxar\u22121 , brxbr\u22121 + higher terms, crxcr\u22121 + higher terms),\nsince \u03b3 \u2032 (x) gives the tangent line to \u03c6(C) at \u03c6(\u03c81 (x)). By definition of D we have:\nD = {(y, w) \u2208 C \u00d7 C \\ \u2206 : (\u03c6(y) \u2212 \u03c6(w)) \u2227 \u03c6(y)\u2032} = 0\n\n(10)\n\nWe have denoted by \u2227 the exterior product in C3 . More precisely, the sub-scheme\nof C \u00d7 C defined by the equation\n\n\f11\n\nOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n(\u03c6(y) \u2212 \u03c6(w)) \u2227 \u03c6(y)\u2032\n\n(11)\n\nis the union D \u222a \u2206, because the diagonal locus is contained in its zero locus, and\nscheme-theoretically with multiplicity 2. In fact, the Taylor development of for\ninstance \u03c6(w) in a neighbourhood of the diagonal gives\n\u03c6(w) = \u03c6(y) + (w \u2212 y)\u03c6\u2032(y) + (w \u2212 y)2R(y, w),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere R(y, w) is a holomorphic function on C \u00d7 C. If we substitute equation 12 in\nequation 11 we find that \u2206 has indeed multiplicity 2 in the zero locus of equation\n11.\nFurthermore, substituting in equation 11 the lower terms of the parametrized curves\nwe get that the matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\narxar\u22121 , xar \u2212 k a xas\nB(x) = \uf8ed brxbr\u22121 , xbr \u2212 k b xbs \uf8f8\ncrxcr\u22121 , xcr \u2212 k c xcs\nmust have rank 1 for all x. First we show that\nsuppose in fact that s > r: we get that\n\uf8eb ar\u22121\nax\n,\nbr\u22121\n\uf8ed\n,\nC(x) = bx\ncxcr\u22121 ,\n\nwe are forced to have s = r. Let us\n\uf8f6\nxar\nxbr \uf8f8\nxcr\n\nhas rank one for all x, which is false (consider for instance the first 2\u00d72 determinant).\nIf instead r > s, we have the lower terms matrix\n\uf8eb as\u22121\n\uf8f6\nax\n, k a xas\nD(x) = \uf8ed bxbs\u22121 , k b xbs \uf8f8\ncxcs\u22121 , k c xcs\nwhich has clearly rank 2 for general x.\nWe have then to consider only the case s = r. In this case, by multiplying by x the\nfirst column and dividing the first (respectively, the second and the third) line by\nxar (respectively by xbr and xcr ), we obtain the following matrix.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na, 1 \u2212 k a\nA(k) = \uf8ed b, 1 \u2212 k b \uf8f8\nc, 1 \u2212 k c\nRemark that if k = 1 the rank drops. However this corresponds to imposing the\ncondition y = w in Equation 12, and this condition defines \u2206 with multiplicity at\nleast 2. Moreover, if we substitute \u03b3(x) and \u03b7(x) in R(y, w) we find that locally\nin a neighbourhood of the diagonal, D is defined by the equation R(y, w) = 0.\nHence the solution k = 1 is irrelevant to our problem because for k = 1 we have\nR(0, 0) 6= 0. By Lemma 1.1 the matrix A(k) has rank one only if k f = 1, where\nf = 1 = GCD(a, b, c), so we have a contradiction. This concludes the proof.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n3\n\n12\n\nApplications and Open Problems\n\nIn this section we would like to prove, in the same spirit of the preceding section, a\nresult about the span of two general tangent lines to a locally toric curve (Proposition\n3.2) in P4 . Moreover we make a conjecture about the sections of a linear system\nthat have zeros with given multiplicity in two given points of a curve (Conjecture\n3.6).\n\n3.1\n\nTangent lines in P4\n\nRemark 3.1. Proposition 2.7 states that for the general locally toric curve C in P3\nwe have that, keeping the same notation of section 2, dim(D) = 0. Remark that, if\none defines D in the same way for a locally toric curve in Pn , we have dim(D) = 0\nas well for every n.\nProposition 3.2. Let C \u2282 P4 be a locally toric curve. Let x and y be general points\nof \u03c6(C) and z \u2208 \u03c6(C), then the tangent lines tx , ty and tz span the whole P4 .\nProof. Let us consider a standard affine subset of P4 isomorphic to C4 and let us\nassume that x, y and z are in this subset.\nLet us now consider the product S 2 C \u00d7 C. We suppose by contradiction that there\nexists an irreducible surface U \u2282 S 2 C \u00d7 C defined in the following way.\nU := {(x, y, z) \u2208 S 2 C \u00d7 C : tz \u2282 Span(tx , ty )}.\nRemark that in our construction it is not necessary to take C \u00d7 C \u00d7 C, in fact,\nsince the span of tx and ty is indipendent from the order of the two points. Now\nwe reduce this problem to the one of Proposition 2.7, thus in the second part of\nthis proof we will omit the details already stated in the proof of Proposition 2.7.\nLet us consider now the partial diagonal \u2206\u2032 \u223c\n= C \u00d7 C, i.e. the set of points of the\ntype (p + p, q), p 6= q and the intersection curve K := U \u2229 \u2206\u2032 \u2282 \u2206\u2032 . Remark that,\nsince x = y = p, the curve K is the set D \u2282 C \u00d7 C \u223c\n= \u2206\u2032 of section 2 and the one\ndimensional diagonal \u2206\u2032\u2032 , i.e. the set of points of the type (p + p, p), is the curve\n\u2206 \u2282 C \u00d7 C of section 2. The fact that dim(K) > 0 contradicts Remark 3.1 thus\nconcluding the proof.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Two Osculating Points Problem\n\nLet us now consider again a curve C of arbitrary genus and a line bundle L on C.\nLet n be a positive integer and let us set a (n + 1)-dimensional vector sub-space\nV \u2282 H 0 (C, L) such that the associated linear series is base point free. We suppose\nmoreover that the morphism\n\u03c6V : C \u2192 PV \u223c\n= Pn\nis non degenerate and birational onto its image. We recall that, given an effective\ndivisor F on C, the notation V (\u2212F ) indicates the intersection V \u2229 H 0 (C, L(\u2212F ))\nwhere L(\u2212F ) is the kernel\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n13\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 L(\u2212F ) \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 LF \u2212\u2192 0\nof the natural evaluation map in F . The theory of the Wronskian assures that for a\ngeneral point p \u2208 C we have that\ndim(V \u2212 (n + 1)p) = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the sub-scheme of points of C such that dim(V \u2212\n(n + 1)p) 6= 0 has dimension zero. A point such that dim(V \u2212 (n + 1)p) 6= 0 is\ncommonly called a flex point [5]. Now let us consider the same problem for a couple\nof general points p, q \u2208 C, i.e. evaluate the dimension of the following sub-scheme\nof the symmetric product S 2 C.\nDefinition 3.3. We set\n\u0393n1 ,n2 := {(p, q) \u2208 S 2 C : dim(V (\u2212n1 p \u2212 n2 q)) 6= 0}.\nWe remark that this definition has sense only for curves of degree deg(C) \u2265 n1 + n2 .\nOne expects that \u0393n1 ,n2 has dimension zero for n1 + n2 = n + 2.\nExample (n = 2)\nIn this case we have a plane curve C of degree at least four and we have either\nn1 = 1 and n2 = 3 or n1 = n2 = 2. We see that \u03931,3 has dimension zero by the\nfiniteness of flex points [5] and \u03932,2 is the set of bitangents, which is finite.\nLet us now consider the case of n = 3. In P3 we have the sub-schemes \u03934,1 and \u03933,2 .\nThe fact that \u03934,1 has dimension zero is a corollary of equation 13. Let D \u2282 C \u00d7 C\nbe the tangentially degenerate locus defined in Equation 9. For the case of \u03933,2 we\nhave the following proposition.\nProposition 3.4. Let C, L and V be as before and dimV = 4. Let us suppose that\nC is locally toric, then\ndim(\u03933,2 ) = dim(D).\n\n(14)\n\nProof. Let pt , qt be points of C, for any t \u2208 C. Let us suppose that we have a family\nof sections S(t) \u2208 V (\u22123pt \u2212 2qt ), t \u2208 C. Remark that by developing S(t) we can\nwrite\nS(t) = S(0) + tS \u2032 (0) + higher terms.\nNow S(0), S(t) \u2208 V , thus we have S \u2032 (t) \u2208 V too. Moreover S(t) \u2208 V (\u22123pt \u2212 2qt )\nand S \u2032 (t) \u2208 V (\u22122pt \u2212 qt ), hence S(t) \u2229 S \u2032 (t) is a trisecant line that cuts out a couple\nof points (pt , qt ) \u2208 D. Let us now suppose that we have a family of couples of points\n(pt , qt ) \u2208 D and let us take the trisecant lt line that cuts out the divisor 2pt + qt .\nLet p\u2217t , qt\u2217 \u2208 P3\u2217 be the images of pt and qt via the dual map of C. The dual variety\nof lt is an hyperlane that cuts out 2p\u2217t + 3qt\u2217 on C \u2217 . By repeating the construction\nof the first part of the proof then implies of a line lt\u2032 \u2208 P3\u2217 that cuts out p\u2217t + 2qt\u2217 on\nC \u2217 . Via dualization again we find an hyperplane in P3 that cuts out 3pt + 2qt on C,\nthus concluding the proof.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n14\n\nCorollary 3.5. Let C,L and V as in Proposition 3.4 and let us suppose that \u03c6V :\nC \u2192 PV is locally toric, then dim(\u03933,2 ) = 0.\nLet C be a curve of arbitrary genus. Let moreover L be as before and V \u2282 H 0 (C, L)\nan (n + 1)-dimensional sub-space such that the associated linear series is base point\nfree. Let \u03c6V : C \u2212\u2192 Pn be the associated map. More generally we have the following\nconjecture.\nConjecture 3.6. The Two Osculating Points Problem\nLet C be a smooth complete complex curve such that the morphism \u03c6V : C \u2212\u2192 Pn\nis locally toric and let n1 , n2 be two positive integers such that n1 + n2 = n + 2. Let\nus moreover suppose that deg(C) \u2265 n + 2, then the sub-scheme \u0393n1 ,n2 has dimension\nzero.\nWe remark that in the case of n1 = n and n2 = 2 a costruction similar to the\none used in the proof of Proposition 3.4 reduces the problem to finding osculating\n(n \u2212 2)-dimensional linear subspaces of Pn that intersect the curve in a second point\ndifferent from the osculating one. This is the problem that we study in the next\nsection. Remark that, for affine rational curves with an analytical parametrization\nof type\nt 7\u2192 (ta1 , . . . , tan ),\nproving that the general osculating space does not meet again the curve is equivalent\nto proving Conjecture 1.2.\n\n4\n\nA few results in higher dimension: osculating\nspaces in Pr\n\nIn this section C will be a locally toric curve like in section 2, but we will consider\nonly the genus 0 and 1 case. The aim of this section is to generalize Proposition 2.7\nto the case of (r \u2212 2)-dimensional osculating spaces, i.e. to show that the general\nosculating (r \u2212 2)-plane at a point of a locally toric curve does not meet the curve in\na second point. When we consider non anomalous curves (see Definition 1.4) we are\nable to perform the reduction and show the result for every r. Unluckily up till now\nwe only know that the number of anomalous 4-plets (that are in natural bijection\nwith local analytical parametrizations of anomalous locally toric curves in P4 ) is\nfinite and possibly zero. However it is very likely that it will be possible to show\nthe finiteness of the anomalous r-plets for every r (see Remark 0.4). Let p \u2208 C, the\nprojective fibre PPpr\u22122 is the osculating (r \u2212 2)-plane at the point p. Let us give the\nfollowing definition,\nDr\u22122 := {(p, q) \u2208 C \u00d7 C \\ \u2206 : q \u2208 PPpr\u22122 }.\n\n(15)\n\nBefore giving the main theorem of this section we need some technical Lemmas. Let\nnow (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 C \u00d7 C and let \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 the translated diagonal\n\u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 := {(p + \u03b1, p + \u03b2) \u2208 C \u00d7 C, \u2200p \u2208 C}.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n15\n\nLemma 4.1. Let C be a genus 1 curve. The curves \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 are the only irreducible\ncurves in C \u00d7 C that do not intersect the diagonal.\nProof. Let us suppose that \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2229 \u2206 6= \u2205. Hence there exist two points p, q \u2208 C\nsuch that p + \u03b1 = q and p + \u03b2 = q. This is true only if \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0 and p = q.\nRemark that, since C \u00d7 C is an abelian variety, every divsor in C \u00d7 C is NEF, thus\nit is ample or it has autointersection equal to zero. The curve \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 is not ample and\nthis concludes the proof.\nLemma 4.2. Let C be an elliptic curve, L \u2208 P ic0 (C) and \u03c6V : C \u2192 PV as before.\nLet P n\u2217 be the bundle of principal parts of order n of OC (1) (see diagrams 6 and 7),\nthen\nh0 (C, P n\u2217 \u2297 OC (1) \u2297 L) = 0 if L 6= OC ;\nh0 (C, P n\u2217 \u2297 OC (1) \u2297 L) 6= 0 if L = OC .\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nProof. By dualizing and twisting by OC (1) \u2297 L the second row of diagram 6 we get\n0 \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 P 1\u2217 \u2297 OC (1) \u2297 L \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03a91C \u2297 L \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(18)\n\nIf L 6= OC then h0 (C, L) = h0 (C, \u2212\u03a91C \u2297 L) = 0 and passing to cohomology we find\nthat h0 (C, P 1\u2217 \u2297 OC (1) \u2297 L) = 0. Now, by dualizing and twisting by OC (1) \u2297 L the\nexact sequence 7, by induction we get that h0 (C, P n\u2217 \u2297 OC (1) \u2297 L) = 0. If L = OC\nthen h0 (C, L) = h1 (C, L) = 1. Remark that the coboundary map\nH 0 (C, \u2212\u03a91C \u2297 L) \u223c\n= H 0 (C, L) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C, L)\nis an isomorphism. This implies that h0 (C, P 1\u2217 \u2297OC (1) \u2297L) = 1. Now, by dualizing\nand twisting by OC (1)\u2297L the exact sequence 7, by induction we get that h0 (C, P n\u2217 \u2297\nOC (1) \u2297 L) > 0.\nTheorem 4.3. Let C \u2282 Pr = PV be as before in this section and g(C) = 0 or 1.\nMoreover, if g(C) = 1 we suppose that the the evaluation map\nevr\u22122 : V \u2212\u2192 P r\u22122\nis surjective. If C is non anomalous then dim(Dr\u22122 ) = 0, i.e. the general osculating (r \u2212 2)-plane does not intersect the curve in a second point different from the\nosculating one.\nProof. By contradiction we suppose that Dr\u22122 has dimension 1. Let D\u0303 be the image\nin C \u00d7 C of the normalization of one irreducible component of Dr\u22122 . Let \u2206 be as\nusual the diagonal. If we are able to show that D\u0303 \u2229 \u2206 6= \u2205 then, since we suppose\nthat C is non anomalous, we have a contradiction. In fact this would imply that,\nby repeating the proof of Proposition 2.7, that the matrix (2) has rank r \u2212 2 for all\nz. This is very easy when g(C) = 0. In fact it is well known that in this case \u2206 is\nample as a divisor of C \u00d7 C and thus it intersects every curve in the product. Now\nwe come to the genus 1 case. Here we have that \u22062 = 2 \u2212 2g = 0 and \u2206 is NEF.\nNow let us suppose that the curve D\u0303 has no point in common with the diagonal \u2206.\nBy Lemma 4.1 this means that there exist two points \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C such that D\u0303 = \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 .\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n16\n\nLet us denote \u03c6V : C \u2192 PV the locally toric morphism. We have a rank 2 vector\nbundle over D\u0303 defined in the following way:\nPN(p,q) := s\u03c6V (p),\u03c6V (q) ,\ni.e. the projectivized fiber over every couple of points in D\u0303 is the secant line joining\nthe two points. More precisely, let us denote Gr(2, r + 1) the Grassmannian of\n2-spaces in V and let\n\u03c4 : C \u00d7 C/\u2206 \u2212\u2192 Gr(2, r + 1)\nbe the secants map. We have the tautological rank 2 vector bundle T on Gr(2, 5)\nand N is the restriction of \u03c4 \u2217 T to D\u0303. Now let us denote \u03c01 (respectively \u03c02 ) the\nprojection from D\u0303 on the first factor (respectively the second). We have a natural\ninclusion PN \u0592\u2192 P\u03c01\u2217 P 2 that comes from the fact that if (p, q) \u2208 D\u0303 then the secant\ns\u03c6V (p),\u03c6V (q) is contained in PPp2 . This is equivalent to a surjection\ng\n\n\u03c01\u2217 P 2 \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0.\nMoreover we have two natural sections D1 and D2 of PN over D\u0303. In fact the curve\nD1 (resp. D2 ) represents the image in PN of the first (resp. the second) component\nof D\u0303 \u2282 C \u00d7 C. Thus we have two surjections\ns\n\n1\n\u03c01\u2217 P 2 \u2212\u2192\n\u03c01\u2217 OC (1) \u2212\u2192 0,\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03c01\u2217 P 2 \u2212\u2192\n\u03c02\u2217 OC (1) \u2212\u2192 0,\n\nand both factorize via g. This implies that we have a third surjection\ns \u2295s\n\n1\n2\n\u03c01\u2217 P 2 \u2212\u2192\n\u03c01\u2217 OC (1) \u2295 \u03c02\u2217 OC (1) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(19)\n\nWe remark that since D\u0303 = \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 we have forcely deg(\u03c01 ) = deg(\u03c02 ) = 1 and thus\ndeg(\u03c01\u2217OC (1)) = deg(\u03c02\u2217OC (1)) = deg(OC (1)). Furthermore we can write \u03c02\u2217 OC (1)\nas \u03c01\u2217 OC (1) \u2297 L, where L \u2208 Jac(D\u0303). Remark that L 6= OC since \u03b1 6= \u03b2.\nNow Lemma 4.2 implies that the last arrow of the exact sequence 19 cannot be a\nsurjection. This in turn implies that D\u0303 cannot be a curve of type \u2206\u03b1,\u03b2 and thus the\nintersection D\u0303 \u2229 \u2206 is not empty. This concludes the proof for g(C) = 1.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. F. Atiyah, Complex analytic connections in fibre bundles, Trans. Amer.\nMath.

There are only finitely many points (\u03be, a, b, c, d) \u2208 C \u00d7 Z4 , with \u03be \u2208\nC, |\u03be| > 1, 0 < a < b < c < d, gcd(a, b, c, d) = 1, such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0 1\n\uf8ec\u03be a a2 a 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec b 2\n\uf8f7\n(\u2217)\nrank \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\u03be c b2 b 1\uf8f7 < 4\n\uf8ed \u03be c c 1\uf8f8\n\u03be d d2 d 1\nAlso, these points can be effectively determined.\nClearly, the condition of coprimality is just a normalization condition: from a solution (\u03be, a, b, c, d) with h = gcd(a, b, c, d) one gets the \"primitive\" solution\n(\u03be h , a/h, b/h, c/h, d/h) and conversely.\nThe underlying geometrical problem appeared also in papers previous to [B-P] (see\nthe references therein). This also leads to an analogous problem for (n + 1) \u00d7 n\nmatrices, whose natural formulation is given in [B-P, Conjecture 1.2], the present\ncase corresponding to n = 4. The case n = 2 is clear, whereas for n = 3 Bolognesi\nand Pirola show by the following simple but ingenious argument that there are\nindeed no solutions at all: any solution gives rise to equations \u03be m = f (m) for\nm = 0, a, b, c, where f (x) = \u03b1x + \u03b2 is a suitable linear complex polynomial. Taking\ncomplex conjugates and multiplying yields |\u03be|2m = q(m) for the same values of m,\nwhere q = |f |2 is a real polynomial of degree \u2264 2. But now Rolle's theorem, applied\nthree times to the real function |\u03be|2x \u2212 q(x) with four distinct zeros, shows this is\nimpossible. (A similar proof has been given independently also by Elkies in January\n2005, as an answer to a question by Izzet Coskun, and Joseph Harris, and we thank\nElkies for forwarding us his solution.) This method however does not work for n > 3.\nConjecture 1.2 of [B-P] states that for any n there are no solutions, i.e. no (n+1)\u00d7n\nmatrices as in (*) with rank < n. Our theorem reduces the case n = 4 to a finite\ncomputation (see the remarks at the end on how this can possibly be implemented\nin practice). We believe that the present method is able to yield an analogue of the\nabove theorem for every n, however with a finite number of exceptions depending\npossibly on n.\nThe proof of the theorem is partially based on the techniques appearing in [B-M-Z].\nWe shall adopt the usual notation h(*) for the logarithmic Weil height as for instance\nin [B-G]. We shall also need the following auxiliary results:\nLemma 1 (Weak form of Dobrowolski). For every \u01eb > 0 there exists a computable\nnumber c(\u01eb) > 0 such that for every algebraic number \u03be, not zero and not root of\nunity,\nh(\u03be) > c(\u01eb)[Q(\u03be) : Q)]\u22121\u2212\u01eb .\n\n\f19\n\nOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\nThe following result appears in [Z], Lemma 1:\nLemma 2. Let \u03be, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3h \u2208 Q, m0 > m1 > . . . > mh = 0 be integers with\n\u03be m0 + \u03b31 \u03be m1 + . . . + \u03b3h = 0.\nAssume also that no subsum of the form \u03be m0 + . . . + \u03b3l \u03be ml , l < h, vanishes. Then\nthere exists a computable number B1 (h) such that\nh(\u03be) \u2264 B1 (h)\n\nmaxi (h(\u03b3i )) + 1\n.\nm0\n\nProof of Theorem. In the sequel B2 , B3 , . . . denote computable absolute constants.\nThe system coming from (\u2217) in the statement consists of five quadrinomial equations\nin \u03be; we do not write them explicitly, but we only remark that:\n(i) all the involved coefficients are nonzero and have height \u226a log d;\n(ii) the exponents for \u03be in the five equations are respectively the five quadruples in\nthe set {0, a, b, c, d}.\nStep 1. As a first step, applying the above Lemma 2 to each of the said quadrinomial\nequations, one can prove the bound\nh(\u03be) \u2264 B2 *\n\nlog d\nd\n\n(1)\n\nfor all solutions \u03be to the system (\u2217).\nWe sketch the argument. This follows immediately if no relevant subsum vanishes in\nat least one of the three equations containing both exponents 0, d. So we may assume\nthat for each of these three equations we have some \"initial subsum\" vanishing. Note\nthat since no coefficient vanishes, such subsum must be binomial.\nTaking the equation with exponents 0, a, b, d, we obtain (from the binomial involving\nb, d) an estimate similar to (1) with d \u2212 b in place of d in the denominator. Then,\narguing with the exponents 0, b, c, d, we obtain (from the binomial involving 0, b) a\nsimilar estimate with b in place of d in the denominator.\nHence in any case we have a bound similar to (1), with max(b, d \u2212 b) \u2265 d/2 in place\nof d, concluding the proof of (1).\nNow, given four coprime integers 0 < a < b < c < d, let us consider the variable\nvector x = (xa , xb , xc , xd ) and define the linear variety L by the condition\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0 1\n\uf8ecxa a2 a 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n2\n\uf8f7<4\nx\nb\nb\n1\nrank \uf8ec\nb\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n2\n\uf8edxc c c 1\uf8f8\nxd d2 d 1\nClearly the variety L is a plane in A4 . With respect to the present coordinates it\nis \"non degenerate\" in the sense that it is not contained in any affine hyperplane\ndefined by a linear equation with three or less terms. This follows from the Van der\nMonde structure of the matrix in question. In fact, the plane L can be parametrized\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n20\n\nas follows: the rank is < 4 if and only if the first column is a linear combination of\nthe last three. Namely, x = (xa , xb , xc , xd ) \u2208 L if and only if there exist (x, y) \u2208 C2\nsuch that\nxa = a2 x + ay + 1, xb = b2 x + by + 1, xc = c2 x + cy + 1, xd = d2 x + dy + 1.\n\n(2)\n\nThese equations also yield a parametrization of the plane L by the parameters x, y.\nIn particular, no two of the coordinates xa , . . . , xd satisfy a linear equation identically\nin L.\nWe are interested in the points P\u03be = (\u03be a , \u03be b , \u03be c , \u03be d) in L for a complex number \u03be with\n|\u03be| > 1.\nIn order to apply Lemma 1, we need an upper bound for the degree of \u03be, which\nshall be obtained via geometry of numbers. Let k * k denote any norm on R4 , e.g.\nthe euclidean length; let \u039b \u2282 Z4 be the lattice of vectors orthogonal to (a, b, c, d).\nMinkowski's second Theorem [B-G, Thm. C.2.11] provides the existence of a basis\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 for \u039b satisfying\nk\u03bb1 k \u2264 k\u03bb2 k \u2264 k\u03bb3 k;\n\nk\u03bb1 k * k\u03bb2 k \u2264 B3 d2/3 ,\n\nwith a constant B3 depending only on the chosen norm. We remark that a careful\nchoice of the norm may produce values of B3 more convenient for actual computations, as we shall observe at the end.\nLet now G \u2282 G4m be the (two dimensional) torus defined by\nx\u03bb1 = x\u03bb2 = 1.\nThis torus corresponds to the primitive lattice generated by \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , in the sense that\na point x is in G if and only if x\u03bb = 1 for every \u03bb in the said lattice.\nLet us suppose first that L \u2229 G is finite, as expected by dimensional considerations.\nIn this case, by B\u00e9zout's theorem, \u266f(L \u2229 G) \u2264 B4 d2/3 ; since both varieties L and G\nare defined over Q, the degree (over Q) of the point (\u03be a , \u03be b, \u03be c , \u03be d ) is \u2264 B4 d2/3 . The\ncoprimality of a, b, c, d implies the same bound for the degree of \u03be:\n[Q(\u03be) : Q] \u2264 B4 d2/3 .\nNow Lemma 1 with any \u01eb < 1/2 provides an explicit upper bound for d, concluding\nthe proof in this case.\nEven if dim(L \u2229 G) \u2265 1 the above method applies, provided P\u03be is an isolated\ncomponent of L \u2229 G.\nLet then assume that P\u03be lies in a component C of L \u2229 G of positive dimension.\nThis situation of anomalous dimension of the intersection of subtori with algebraic\nsubvarities of GN\nm is the object of [B-M-Z]. We follow some of the arguments therein.\nStep 2. We prove that C is a conic or a line in L.\nThe non degeneracy of L implies that C has dimension \u2264 1: otherwise, L would be\nequal to G, so in particular xa , xb , xc would be multiplicatively dependent on L, but\nthe above representation (2) excludes this, by the non-proportionality of the linear\nforms which appear. So we can suppose that C is a curve.\n\n\f21\n\nOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\nSince the equations of the plane L and the equations x\u03bb1 = 1, x\u03bb2 = 1 hold identically\non C, the corresponding jacobian determinant vanishes on C.\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nWriting \u03bbi = (li,a , li,b , li,c , li,d ) for i = 1, 2, the equations for G read: xa 1,a * * * xd 1,d =\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n1; xa 2,a * * * xd 2,d = 1. Equations for L can be written as xc = \u03b2xa + \u03b3xb \u2212 \u03b4, xd =\n\u03b2 \u2032 xa + \u03b3 \u2032 xb \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 . We arrive at the equation\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b2\n\u03b3 \u22121 0\n\uf8ec \u03b2\u2032\n\u03b3\u2032\n0 \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03bb\ndet \uf8ec \u03bb1,a 1,b \u03bb1,c \u03bb1,d \uf8f7 = 0\n\uf8ed xa\nxb\nxc\nxd \uf8f8\n\u03bb2,a\nxa\n\n\u03bb2,b\nxb\n\n\u03bb2,c\nxc\n\n\u03bb2,d\nxd\n\nDue to the nondegeneracy of L, i.e. equations (2), no 2 \u00d7 2 minor of the first two\nrows vanishes. So, by the linear independence of \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , this determinant does not\nvanish identically as a function of four independent variables. Actually, substituting\nxa , xb , xc , xd by their representation (2) valid on L, the determinant does not vanish\nidentically on L, since the linear polynomials in (2) are pairwise non proportional.\nAfter clearing the denominators and using the parametrization (2), this becomes a\nnon trivial quadratic equation in x, y. We then obtain the statement of the Step 2.\nStep 3. Conclusion. If C is a line, then each coordinate xa , . . . , xd is a linear function\nof a parameter t; by the parametrization (2), at most one of them can be constant\non C. Take any equation x\u03bb = 1 valid on G, containing a coordinate non constant\non C. Such a coordinate will vanish on a point P \u2208 C, so the equation must contain\nanother coordinate vanishing on C, necessarily proportional on C to the first one.\nOn the other hand, we cannot have three pairwise proportional coordinates on C,\nbecause otherwise three of the linear forms in (2) would have a common zero. In view\nof the previous conclusion, and since G has codimension two, the four coordinates\nmust be proportional in pairs, in particular non constant. Now, the ratio between\ntwo multiplicatively dependent and proportional linear polynomials is necessarily a\nroot of unity. But then P\u03be cannot lie on C, otherwise \u03be itself would be a root of\nunity.\nSuppose now C is a conic. We argue as follows: first note that in this case no\ncoordinate function can be constant on C, nor can two coordinates be proportional\non C, otherwise C would be a line. Then we distinguish two cases: (P) C is a parabola\nand (H) C is a hyperbola.\nIn case (P), all the four coordinates (viewed as regular functions on C) have a pole\nat the unique point at infinity of C; suppose now that two coordinates, say xa , xb ,\nhave a simple pole at infinity; then the same must hold also for xc , xd , since from\nthe representation (2) it follows that xc , xd are linear combinations of xa , xb . But\nthis is impossible, since in this case C would be a line. Then it remains to consider\nthe case when at most one coordinate has a simple pole, so the other three, say\nxa , xb , xc have each a double pole at infinity. Let us write a nontrivial multiplicative\ndependence relation, which, after possibly permuting the indices, takes the form\nn\nl\nxm\na xb = xc , with m, n, l non negative and not all zero (such a relation exists since\nG has dimensione two). Looking at the poles we get l = m + n; looking at the\nzeros, we obtain that necessarily two out of xa , xb , xc have the same zeros. Then the\ncorresponding ratio would be constant, contrary to the assumption that C is not a\nline.\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n22\n\nLet us now consider case (H), when C is a hyperbola, hence has two points Q1 6=\nQ2 at infinity. We distinguish three subcases: (Ha) there exist two coordinates,\nmultiplicatively independent on C, having poles both at Q1 and at Q2 . (Hb) any\ntwo coordinates having poles both at Q1 and Q2 are multiplicatively dependent on\nC; (Hc) there is at most one coordinate having poles both in Q1 and in Q2 .\nIn case (Ha), we can suppose xa , xb are multiplicatively independent on C and have\npoles both at Q1 and at Q2 . Since the group G has dimension 2, there exist positive\npowers of both xc and xd which equal a product of powers of xa , xb on G, hence on\nn\nC. From a relation xec = xm\na xb , with e, m, n \u2208 Z, e > 0 it follows that m + n = e\nand that xc too has both poles, other wise xc would have no pole, so it would be\nconstant which we have excluded. Then, after interchanging if necessary the roles\nof xa , xb , xc , we can suppose m > 0, n \u2264 0. If n = 0, then xa /xc would be constant,\nwhich is impossible as observed. If n < 0, then each zero of xb (on the conic C)\nwould be a zero of xa (otherwise xc would have another pole); now, if xb had two\nsimple zeros, xa should have exactly the same zeros with the same multiplicities,\nso xa /xb would be constant, which is excluded. Then xb would have a double zero,\nsay P1 , xc another double zero, say P2 , and xa has zeros in P1 , P2 . Repeating the\nsame argument with xd , we see that the zero set of xd is also contained in {P1 , P2 }.\nSince there are only three possibilities for the zero divisor of the four functions\nxa , xb , xc , xd , namely P1 + P2 , 2P1 , 2P2 , some ratio must be constant.\nIn case (Hb), suppose xa , xb have (simple) poles in Q1 , Q2 and are multiplicatively\nn\n2\ndependent. But then from a relation xm\na xb = 1 with (m, n) \u2208 Z \\ {0} it follows\nlooking at the poles that n = \u2212m, so xa /xb is constant, which would imply that C\nis a line.\nFinally, in case (Hc), two coordinates would have poles just in one point P1 ; but we\nhave already remarked that by (2) any two coordinates generate the others as linear\ncombinations, so all coordinates would have just one points at infinity, the same for\nall, contrary to the assumption that C is a hyperbola.\nThis concludes the sketch of the proof. We remark that Step 3 does not follow [B-MZ]. An alternative but more involved argument would follow [B-M-Z] more closely:\nusing the fact that deg(C) is bounded, we would first prove that \u03bb1 has bounded\nlength. This would allow a finite number of parametrizations of a, b, c, d in terms of\nthree unknowns which would be the first step for an induction. Perhaps in case of\nhigher dimension this last method will be necessary.\n\u00a72 Quantification.\nFact 1. In place of Dobrowolski Theorem (Lemma 1), we can use Smyth result:\nLemma 3. Let \u03be be a non reciprocal algebraic number. Then\nh(\u03be) \u2265\n\nlog \u03b80\n0.28\n\u2265\n[Q(\u03be) : Q]\n[Q(\u03be) : Q]\n\nwhere \u03b80 is the real root of z 3 = z + 1.\nIn fact, we prove as follows that we can disregard reciprocal numbers \u03be. If (\u2217) is\nverified there exists a non zero polynomial f (X) \u2208 Q\u0304[X] of degree \u2264 2 such that\nf (m) = \u03be m for m = 0, a, b, c, d. If \u03be is reciprocal, there exists a Galois automorphism \u03c3 such that \u03be \u03c3 = \u03be \u22121 . Then applying \u03c3 and multiplying we obtain that the\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n23\n\npolynomial f (X)f \u03c3 (X) \u2212 1 has five distinct zeros which may happen only if f is\nconstant, which is a case easily dealt with.\nA more explicit version of Lemma 2 will lead to explicit quantitative bounds:\nLemma 4. Let \u03be, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3h \u2208 Q, m0 > m1 > . . . > mh = 0 be integers with\n\u03be m0 + \u03b31 \u03be m1 + . . . + \u03b3h = 0.\nLet l < h be such that the subsum\n\u03be m0 + \u03b31 \u03be m1 + . . . + \u03b3l \u03be ml 6= 0\nThen\n(ml \u2212 ml+1 )h(\u03be) \u2264 h(1 : \u03b31 : . . . : \u03b3h ) + log max{l + 1, h \u2212 l}.\nQ\nProof. One applies the product formula \u03bd |\u03c6|\u03bd = 1to \u03c6 := \u03be m0 + \u03b31 \u03be m1 + . . . + \u03b3l \u03be ml .\nWe estimate the various factors as follows: if |\u03be|\u03bd < 1 then\nl\n|\u03c6|\u03bd < |\u03be|m\n\u03bd sup(1, |\u03b31 |\u03bd , . . . , |\u03b3l |\u03bd ) * sup(1, |l + 1|\u03bd ).\n\nm\nIf |\u03be|\u03bd \u2265 1, one uses the equation \u03c6 = \u2212(\u03b3l+1 \u03bel+1\n+ . . . + \u03b3h ) to obtain\n+1\n|\u03c6|\u03bd \u2264 |\u03be|m\nsup(1, |\u03b3l+1|\u03bd , . . . , |\u03b3h|\u03bd ) * sup(1, |h \u2212 l|\u03bd ).\n\u03bd\n\nTaking the product over all \u03bd one obtains the estimate of the Lemma.\nThe three equations coming from (\u2217) and involving the term \u03be d are of the shape\n\u03be d rs(s \u2212 r) \u00b1 \u03be s dr(d \u2212 r) \u00b1 \u03be r ds(d \u2212 s) \u00b1 (d \u2212 r)(d \u2212 s)(s \u2212 r) = 0,\nwhere r < s are two integers in {a, b, c}.\nIf, as in Step 1, in at least one of the equations no initial subsum vanishes, we can\napply Lemma 4 for l = 0, 1, 2 to find\n83\n\u2264 9 log d \u2212 3.347.\n18\nThis inequality holds a fortiori in the other cases (by following Step 1).\ndh(\u03be) \u2264 9 log d \u2212 log\n\nTo quantify the step involving Minkowski's Theorem, one can check that\nk\u03bb1 k * k\u03bb2 k \u2264 96d2/3 .\nHere the involved norm k * k is the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates; this\nchoice of the norm is motivated by the fact the degree of the closure of the variety\nx\u03bb = 1 is \u2264 k\u03bbk. So the bound 96d2/3 holds for the degree of \u03be.\nFinally we obtain\n83\n0.28 * d1/3\n\u2264\n9\nlog\nd\n\u2212\nlog\n.\n962/3\n18\nThis bound is explicit, for instance it gives d < 1013 , but this is too large for explicit\ncomputations of all the relevant cases.\nTo obtain more realistic estimates one could proceed as follows:\n\n\fOsculating spaces and diophantine equations\n\n24\n\nLet a0 \u03be t +. . .+at = 0 be a minimal equation for \u03be over Z (so in particular t = [Q(\u03be) :\nQ]). Then trivially one has h(\u03be) \u2265 (log max(|a0 |, |at |))/t. This largely improves on\nLemma 3 unless a0 , at are both small, i.e. \u03be is 'almost' a unit. (Note that already if\nmax(|a0 |, |at |) \u2265 2 we replace 0.28 by log 2 > 0.69.)\nIf this is the case however we can gain on refining Lemma 4. For instance note\nthat if \u03be is actually a unit using the above equations we find for each conjugate\n|\u03be \u03c3 |d\u2212s \u2264\u2248 d(d\u2212r)\n. For a 'general' choice of r, s this ratio on the right will be\ns(s\u2212r)\nabsolutely bounded, providing a further saving.\nFinally, the right norm to consider in applying Minkowski comes from an estimation\nm4\n1\nfor the degree of the closure in P4 of a hypersurface defined by xm\n= 1,\n1 * * * x4\nwhere mi \u2208 Z. The degree equals the maximum between the sum of the positive,\nor \u2212 negative, entries of (m1 , . . . , m4 ). This quantity defines actually a norm, and\nyields better constants than the above choice.\nTo perform this program however leads to several computing verifications and distinction into cases, which we have by now not performed, hoping that some expert\nof such matters can be interested enough to do this job. In this respect we remark\nthat for the geometric application in the paper, it is substantial to pass from finitely\nmany solutions to no solution at all.\nReferences\n[B-G] E. Bombieri, W.
