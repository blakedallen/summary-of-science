For the gluon fusion process, analysis of the azimuthal\nangle correlations of the two jets provides for a direct measurement of the CP-nature of the\nHtt Yukawa coupling which is responsible for the effective Hgg vertex.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHiggs boson production in association with two jets has emerged as a promising channel for\nHiggs boson discovery and for the study of Higgs boson properties at the LHC. Interest has\nconcentrated on vector-boson-fusion (VBF), i.e. the weak process qq \u2192 qqH which is mediated\nby t-channel exchange of a W or Z, with the Higgs boson being radiated off this weak boson.\nThe VBF production cross section measures the strength of the W W H and ZZH couplings,\nwhich, at tree level, require a vacuum expectation value for the scalar field. Hence the VBF\nchannel is a sensitive probe of the Higgs mechanism as the source of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking.\nAnother prominent source of Hjj events are second order real emission corrections to the\ngluon fusion process. Such corrections were first considered in Ref. 1,2 in the large top mass\nlimit and have subsequently been evaluated for arbitrary quark masses in the loops which induce\nthe effective coupling of the Higgs boson to gluons.3 For a SM Higgs boson, the generic Hjj\ncross section from gluon fusion can somewhat exceed the VBF cross section of a few pb 3 and,\nthus, gluon fusion induced Hjj events should also provide useful information on Higgs boson\nproperties.\nIn this contribution we focus on the CP properties of the Higgs Yukawa coupling to the top\nquark, which is given by\nLY = yt H t\u0304t + i\u1ef9t At\u0304\u03b35 t,\n(1)\nwhere H and A denote scalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs fields. Top quark loops then induce\neffective couplings of the Higgs boson to gluons which, for Higgs masses well below mt , can be\ndescribed by the effective Lagrangian 1,2\nLeff =\n\nyt\nSM\nyt\n\n*\n\n\u03b1s\n\u03b1s\n\u1ef9t\n* H Ga\u03bc\u03bd Ga \u03bc\u03bd + SM *\n* A Ga\u03bc\u03bd Ga\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n12\u03c0v\n16\u03c0v\nyt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ga\u03bc\u03bd denotes the gluon field strength. From the effective Lagrangian emerge Hgg, Hggg\nand also Hgggg vertices, which correspond to triangle, box and pentagon top quark loops and\nwhich contribute to gluon fusion processes such as qq \u2192 qqH, qg \u2192 qgH or gg \u2192 ggH. One\nexample for the first process and for the corresponding VBF diagram is shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\fq\n\nq\ng\nW, Z\n\nH, A\n\nt\n\nH\nW, Z\n\ng\nq\n\nq\n\nFigure 1: Quark scattering processes contributing to Hjj production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion.\n\n2\n\nAzimuthal angle correlations\n\nAnalogous to the corresponding VBF case,4,5 the distribution of the azimuthal angle between\nthe two jets in gluon fusion induced Hjj events can be used to determine the tensor structure\nof the effective Hgg vertex, which emerges from Eq.(2) as\nT \u03bc\u03bd = a2 (q1 * q2 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q1\u03bd q2\u03bc ) + a3 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 q1\u03c1 q2\u03c3 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u1ef9t\nyt\n\u03b1s\n\u03b1s\n* 3\u03c0v\n* 2\u03c0v\nand a3 = \u2212 ySM\n. We assume SM-size couplings in our analysis below.\nwith a2 = ySM\nt\nt\nIn resolving interference effects between the CP-even coupling a2 and the CP-odd coupling\na3 it is important to measure the sign of the azimuthal angle between the jets. Naively one might\nassume that this sign cannot be defined unambiguously in pp collisions because an azimuthal\nangle switches sign when viewed along the opposite beam direction. However, in doing so, the\n\"toward\" and the \"away\" tagging jets also switch place, i.e. one should take into account the\ncorrelation of the tagging jets with the two distinct beam directions. Defining \u2206\u03a6jj as the\nazimuthal angle of the \"away\" jet minus the azimuthal angle of the \"toward\" jet, a switch of the\ntwo beam directions leaves the sign of \u2206\u03a6jj intact.5 The corresponding distributions, for two\njets with\npT j > 30 GeV,\n|\u03b7j | < 4.5,\n|\u03b7j1 \u2212 \u03b7j2 | > 3.0 ,\n(4)\n\nare shown in Fig. 2 for three scenarios of CP-even and CP-odd Higgs couplings. All three cases\nare well distinguishable. The maxima in the distributions are directly connected to the size of\nthe parameters a2 and a3 in Eq. (3). For\na2 = a cos \u03b1 ,\n\na3 = a sin \u03b1 ,\n\n(5)\n\nthe positions of the maxima are at \u2206\u03a6jj = \u03b1 and \u2206\u03a6jj = \u03b1 \u00b1 \u03c0.\n3\n\nObservability at the LHC\n\nThe azimuthal angle correlations of the two leading jets in gluon fusion are fairly independent of\nthe Higgs boson mass and they do not depend on the Higgs decay mode, except via kinematical\neffects due to cuts on the decay products. In order to observe them, however, background\nprocesses have to be suppressed by a sufficient degree. Clearly, this depends on which decay\nchannels are available for the Higgs boson. The most promising case is a SM-like Higgs boson\nof mass around mH \u2248 160 GeV with decay H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 p/T (l = e, \u03bc). We here give a\nbrief summary of our findings. Details of the parton level simulation are given Ref. 6 Similar to\nthe analogous H \u2192 W W search in VBF,7 the dominant backgrounds arise from tt\u0304 production\nin association with 0, 1, or 2 additional jets and from W W jj production at order \u03b12 \u03b12s (QCD\nW W jj production) or at order \u03b14 (EW W W jj production, which includes H \u2192 W W in VBF).\n\n\f1/ \u03c3 d\u03c3/d\u2206\u03a6jj\n\n45\n\n\u00d710-3\n\n40\n\npp \u2192 jj H\n\nCP-even\n\nmH = 160 GeV\n\nCP-odd\nCP-mixed\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\u2206\u03a6jj\n\nFigure 2: Normalized distributions of the jet-jet azimuthal angle difference as defined in the text.

One finds,\nhowever, that the characteristic modulation of the \u2206\u03c6jj distribution in Fig. 2 is most pronounced\nfor large rapidity separations of the tagging jets.6 Imposing \u2206\u03b7jj > 3, one obtains the cross\nsections in the second to last column of Table 1 and azimuthal angle distributions as shown in\nFig. 3 for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\u22121 . Already for 30 fb\u22121 of data, however, can one\ndistinguish the SM expectation in the left panel of Fig. 3 from the CP-odd case in the right\npanel with a purely statistical power of more than 5 sigma.
