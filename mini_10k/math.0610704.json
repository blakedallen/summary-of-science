Sternberg\nJune 2006\nMathematics\nAbstract\nOver the past sixteen years, Kashiwara's construction of crystal bases [18, 19] has\nbeen an invaluable tool in addressing questions in representation theory, statistical\nmechanics, and soliton cellular automata. This dissertation addresses two current\nquestions in the theory of crystal bases: the structure of crystal bases for Kirillov(1)\n\nReshetikhin modules over algebras of type Dn , and the local structure of doubly\nlaced crystals. It also includes a user manual for the CrystalView software package,\nwhich was written by the author.\nThe first of these questions is addressed in Chapters 2 and 3. Specifically, in\nChapter 2 we describe a conjecture for the structure of the crystal bases B r,s that cor(1)\n\nrespond to the Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules W r,s of type Dn . Specifically, we prove\nthat many aspects of the combinatorial structure of these crystals are determined\nby representation theoretical concerns, leaving only a small aspect of this structure\nunspecified. Our conjecture specifies this part of the structure of these crystals uniformly. This result is based on the work and conjectures of the X = M program put\nforward in [9, 10]. In Chapter 3 we prove that this conjecture is true for the special\ncase of r = 2.\nThe second of these questions is the subject of Chapter 4. Building on the work of\n[46], we confirm a conjecture of Stembridge that limits the local behavior of crystals\nfor representations of Lie algebras all of whose rank two subalgebras are either A1 \u00d7A1 ,\nA2 , or C2 . Specifically, we show that if v is a vertex in such a crystal with both an\ni-colored and a j-colored edge directed into it, one of four pairs of sequences (E1 , E2 ),\neach composed of the operators ei and ej , satisfies E1 v = E2 v.\nIn Chapter 5, we explain the features, usage, and implementation of CrystalView.\n\nvi\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nI first wish to thank Anne Schilling for her excellent supervision of the work contained\nin this dissertation. The training I received under her guidance both as a creator and\ncommunicator of mathematics has been truly exceptional. The results contained here\ncould not have been obtained without Prof. Schilling's help as critic and collaborator.\nMy thanks are also extended to the other members of my dissertation committee, Eric Rains and Monica Vazirani, who also served on my qualifying examination\ncommittee. They have both been a great help to me in many conversations as I have\nexplored many diverse mathematical interests.\nI could not have completed my degree without the support of my wife, Mary\nOrland. The obstacles to completing a Ph.D. are not solely intellectual\u2013Mary helped\nme to meet many of these other challenges. My gratitude is due to her for keeping\nme out of the trouble in which I could have very easily found myself without her\nassistance.\nIt is unlikely that I would have ever considered pursuing an advanced degree had\nI not had as a role model my father, David Sternberg. From my earliest memories,\nmy father encouraged me to pursue new knowledge and understanding in every way\npossible. I am proud to be able to dedicate this dissertation to the honor of his\nmemory. I was also always supported by my mother, Linda Sternberg, throughout\nmy studies. I am forever grateful to both of my parents for their love and support,\nand their belief that my capability was limited only by my ambition.\n\nvii\n\n\fMany thanks are also extended to Isaiah Lankham, who has been a splendid officemate, travelling companion, and dear friend for the past four years. In particular,\nIsaiah's editorial improvements on many of my papers and his suggestions pertaining\nto CrystalView were indispensible.\nThe result of Chapter 4 could not have been obtained without John Stembridge,\nto whom I also extend my thanks; not only is he responsible for the seminal paper\nwhich it generalizes, but he also provided very helpful insights into the mechanics of\nthis problem. My thanks are also given to Masato Okado, Tomoki Nakanishi, and\nMark Shimozono for their very helpful comments regarding the work of Chapters 2\nand 3.\nI would also like to thank Jes\u00fas de Loera and Greg Kuperberg for serving on my\nqualifying examination committee, and for many helpful and enjoyable conversations\nover the past years. My thanks are particularly due to Prof. de Loera for his suggestion that I investigate working with Prof. Schilling, and to Prof. Kuperberg for\nagreeing to serve on my examination committee on very short notice after one of my\noriginal committee members found himself suddenly unavailable.\nIn the course of publishing and presenting the research contained here, several\nanonomous referees have provided comments and criticisms which have ultimately\nimproved the exposition of these results considerably. I wish to thank these referees\nfor volunteering their time for the betterment of the community.\nParts of this research were carried out while I was a guest at two excellent institutions, the Max-Plank-Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik in Bonn, Germany, and the Research\nInstitute for the Mathematical Sciences in Kyoto, Japan. I extend my thanks to these\norganizations for their hospitality.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grants DMS-0135345, DMS-0200774,\nand DMS-0501101.\n\nviii\n\n\f1\n\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\n1.1\n1.1.1\n\nHistorical Overview and Motivation\nRepresentation Theory\n\nThe study of representation theory has as its goal the understanding of algebraic\nobjects in terms of their action on other objects. For instance, we may study groups\nby their action on a set of elements (a permutation representation) or on a vector\nspace (a linear representation). This notion is formally described by realizing this\naction as a homomorphism from the object being studied into the the most general\nset of symmetries of the object being acted upon. In the above examples, these would\nbe a homomorphism from a group into a group of permutations or into the general\nlinear group of a vector space, respectively.\nIf we wish to study the representation theory of an algebra A over a field K, we\nconsider morphisms \u03c1 : A \u2192 gl(V ), where V is a vector space over K. If A is a Lie\nalgebra, we take gl(V ) to be the general linear Lie algebra of transformations of V ;\nif A is instead an associative algebra, we take as gl(V ) the associative general linear\nalgebra of V .\nIn the following work, we are concerned with representations of Quantum Groups,\n\n\f1.1. Historical Overview and Motivation\n\n2\n\nalso known as Quantized Universal Enveloping Algebras. These are associative algebras over the field C(q) of rational functions with complex coefficients. Denoted by\nUq (g), they can be realized as a quantization deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U(g) of a Lie algebra g. When g is a Kac-Moody algebra, there is a\nstraightforward presentation of Uq (g) by generators and relations.\nSpecifically, we have the following, after [11].\nDefinition 1.1.1. Let I be a finite indexing set; let A = (aij ) : i, j \u2208 I be a\nsymmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix with symmetrizing matrix D = diag(si ) :\ni \u2208 I, and let \u03a0, \u03a0\u2228 , P, and P \u2228 be the set of simple roots, simple coroots, weight\nlattice, and dual weight lattice of the corresponding Kac-Moody Lie algebra g. The\nassociated quantum group Uq (g) is the associative C(q)-algebra with unit generated\nby ei and fi for i \u2208 I and q h for h \u2208 P \u2228 with the following relations:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2022 q 0 = 1, q h q h = q h+h for h, h\u2032 \u2208 P \u2228,\n\u2022 q h ei q \u2212h = q \u03b1i (h) ei for h \u2208 P \u2228,\n\u2022 q h fi q \u2212h = q \u2212\u03b1i (h) fi for h \u2208 P \u2228 ,\n\u2022 ei fj \u2212 fj ei = \u03b4ij\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nP1\u2212aij\nk=0\n\nP1\u2212aij\nk=0\n\n(\u22121)k\n(\u22121)k\n\nKi \u2212Ki\u22121\nqi \u2212qi\u22121\n\n\u0002 1\u2212aij \u0003\nk\n\n\u0002 1\u2212aij \u0003\nk\n\nfor i, j \u2208 I,\n\n1\u2212a \u2212k\ne ij ej eki\nqi i\n1\u2212a \u2212k\nf ij fj fik\nqi i\n\n= 0 for i 6= j,\n= 0 for i 6= j,\n\nwhere qi = si and Ki = q si hi , and the symbol [n]q =\n\nq n \u2212q \u2212n\nq\u2212q \u22121\n\nfor n \u2208 Z\u22650 .\n\nThe algebra Uq (g) has a representation theory that refines the representation\ntheory of the associated Lie algebras by means of quantization deformation. More\nprecisely, given a simple highest weight module M over g, we can construct a simple\nmodule Mq over Uq (g) whose weight spaces multiplicities are the same as those of M,\n\n\f1.1. Historical Overview and Motivation\n\n3\n\nas proved by Lusztig in [32]. Furthermore, tensor products of such deformed modules decompose into simple modules in the same way as their classical counterparts.\nThus, the representation theory of Uq (g) retains all algebraic information about g, in\naddition to it modules having a natural grading by powers of q.\n\n1.1.2\n\nCrystal Bases\n\nThe representation theory of Lie algebras has always had close ties to combinatorics.\nUsing the technique of crystal bases, Kashiwara developed a completely discrete language for describing modules over quantum groups, and thus also modules over Lie\nalgebras [18, 19]. Specifically, given any highest weight integrable Uq (g)-module V ,\nthere is a colored directed graph B(V ) called the crystal graph of V that encodes\nnearly all of the information of the action of Uq (g) on V . Abstracting this notion,\none can define crystals without making an explicit reference to a particular representation. This definition includes all crystals that come from g-modules, as well\nas crystals that cannot be thus realized. Such axiomatic crystals have been used to\nprove several significant results in the theory of crystal bases.\nPrecisely, we have the following definition of crystals, after [20].\nDefinition 1.1.2. Let I be a finite index set, let A = (aij ) for i, j \u2208 I be a Cartan\nmatrix, and let (\u03a0, \u03a0\u2228 , P, P \u2228) be the associated Cartan data of a Kac-Moody algebra\ng as in Definition 1.1.1. A g-crystal is a set B together with maps wt : B \u2192 P, ei, fi :\nB \u2192 B \u222a {0}, and \u03b5i, \u03c6i : B \u2192 Z \u222a {\u2212\u221e} for i \u2208 I such that:\n\u2022 \u03c6i (b) = \u03b5i(b) + hhi , wt(b)i for all i \u2208 I,\n\u2022 wt(ei b) = wtb + \u03b1i if ei b \u2208 B,\n\u2022 wt(fi b) = wtb \u2212 \u03b1i if fi b \u2208 B,\n\u2022 \u03b5i (ei b) = \u03b5i(b) \u2212 1, \u03c6i(ei b) = \u03c6i (b) + 1 if ei b \u2208 B,\n\n\f1.1. Historical Overview and Motivation\n\n4\n\n\u2022 \u03b5i (fi b) = \u03b5i(b) + 1, \u03c6i(fi b) = \u03c6i (b) \u2212 1 if fi b \u2208 B,\n\u2022 fi b = b\u2032 if and only if b = ei b for b, b\u2032 \u2208 B, i \u2208 I,\n\u2022 if \u03c6i (b) = \u2212\u221e for b \u2208 B, then ei b = fi b = 0.\nThe corresponding crystal graph has a vertex for each b \u2208 B and an i-colored edge\nfrom b to b\u2032 if fi b = b\u2032 .\n\n1.1.3\n\nQuantum Affine Algebras\n\nMany current questions involving crystal bases pertain to crystals for modules of\nquantum affine algebras; i.e., quantum groups Uq (g) where the underlying algebra\ng is of affine type. Two important classes of representations of these algebras are\nfinite dimensional modules and highest weight modules. Many existing methods for\nanalyzing representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups, both combinatorial\nand algebraic, only apply to highest weight modules. A great deal of new work\nwas therefore needed to address questions about the finite-dimensional representation\ntheory of quantum affine algebras.\nFinite-dimensional modules of quantum affine algebras were classified by Chari\nand Pressley using Drinfeld polynomials [3], taking a major step toward understanding\nthese representation theoretical concerns. However, many of the internal aspects of\nthese representations remain poorly understood. One approach to understanding\nthese representations more explicitly is by determining if they have crystal bases, and\nif so, describing their structure via an explicit discrete construction.\nIn [25, 26], a relationship was observed between the Bethe ansatz (a method\nfor solving lattice models in statistical mechanics) and the combinatorics of Young\ntableaux. There it was proposed that a certain family of modules over quantum\n(1)\n\naffine algebras of type An , which have come to be called Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, should be combinatorializable (as these papers precede [18], we do not use the\n\n\f1.1. Historical Overview and Motivation\n\n5\n\nterm \"crystallizable\"). This claim is motivated by the fact that another method for\nsolving the same lattice models, the corner transfer matrix, makes use of the combinatorics that govern type A representation theory. The Bethe ansatz gives rise to\nanother set of combinatorial objects, called rigged configurations; since the formulas arising from these two methods are equal, there should be a bijection between\nrigged configurations and Young tableaux. As this notion was formalized over the\nnext decade, the combinatorial notion of crystals, type-independent tableaux, and\ntype-independent rigged configurations allowed the work of [25, 26] to be generalized.\nIn [9, 10], the Kyoto school proposed that all Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules of all\ntypes have crystal bases, and furthermore that the only finite-dimensional modules of\nquantum affine algebras with crystal bases are tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin\nmodules. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding these crystals\nand proving these claims. For a thorough review of the current state of this program,\nsee [41]. Here, we summarize the known results for Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals [36].\n(1)\n\nFor type An , the crystals are known to exist [17] and their explicit structure is\nknown [45]. For non-exceptional algebras, [15] gives a realization of B 1,s as the set\nof lattice points in a convex polytope. The crystal B r,1 for all algebras was shown\nto exist in [22], and a realization using Lakshmibai-Seshadri (L-S) paths has been\nconstructed in [34]. Other cases include those of the spin represantations B n,s for\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nCn , B n,s and B n\u22121,s for Dn , and B n,s for Dn+1 , which are shown to exist and given\nexplicitly in [17]. In [1] any case in which the highest classical component of B r,s\nis the adjoint representation of the classical subalgebra is dealt with. The crystal\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nstructures have also been given for B r,1+\u03b4rn for Bn , B r,2 with r 6= n for Cn , B r,1\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\u2020\n\nwith r 6= n and r 6= n \u2212 1 for Dn [28], B r,1 for Cn , B r,1 for A2n , B r,1 for A2n\u22121 [13],\n(1)\n\nand B 1,s for G2 [48].\nThe results of [38, 39] reduce the problem to simply laced types using virtual\ncrystals, a technique whereby Dynkin diagram folding is extended to crystals. There-\n\n\f1.2. Summary of Main Results\n\n6\n(1)\n\nfore, these conjectures need only to be resolved for types Dn\n\n(1)\n\n(n \u2265 4) and En\n\n(n \u2208 {6, 7, 8}). Furthermore, it has been shown in [7] that given certain assumptions\nabout the crystals B r,s , their affine structure is uniquely specified by an isomorphism with Demazure crystals. Thus, defining a crystal structure satisfying these\nassumptions constitutes a significant step towards understanding their combinatorial\nstructure.\n\n1.1.4\n\nLocal Characterization of Crystals\n\nCrystals were originally developed to describe representations of Lie algebras; however, many objects satisfying Definition 1.1.2 do not correspond to any Uq (g)-module.\nIt is therefore of interest to know when a colored directed graph is the crystal graph of\na representation. Such a characterization can be used to show that a graph that does\nnot a priori encode representation theoretic information is in fact a crystal graph.\nMany explicit combinatorial models have been developed for crystal graphs of\nrepresentations; two of these are paths in the weight lattice of g [30, 31] and generalized Young tableaux [24]. In all of these cases, the combinatorial properties of the\ncrystals are defined globally. In [46], Stembridge introduced a set of graph theoretic\naxioms, each of which addresses only local properties of a colored directed graph, that\ncharacterizes highest weight crystal graphs that come from representations of simply\nlaced algebras.\n\n1.2\n\nSummary of Main Results\n\nThe first main result presented here is a conjectural explicit description of crystals for\n(1)\n\nKirillov-Reshetikhin modules over an algebra of type Dn . We investigate the structure of such modules as modules over the embedded algebras of type Dn and Dn\u22121 ,\ndiscovering some very significant symmetries. Based on a refinement of the branching\n\n\f1.2. Summary of Main Results\n\n7\n\nproperties of B r,s over these algebras, we formulate a combinatorial conjecture for the\nstructure of these crystals.\nSpecifically, given r \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} and s \u2208 Z\u22650 , we construct a crystal B\u0303 r,s .\nConjecture 1.2.1. Assuming that B r,s exists with the properties conjectured in [9,\n10], we have\nB r,s \u2243 B\u0303 r,s .\nThe work of [7] shows that if we assume B r,s to have certain properties, its affine\nstructure is specified by the inclusion of a Demazure module in it. Thus, if these hypotheses (which are less demanding than those of [9, 10]) are satisfied, this conjecture\nis true.\nAs evidence of this conjecture, we prove in Section 3.3 that in the case of r = 2, the\naffine structure of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules respects the observed symmetries.\nWe thus have the following Theorem, as proved in [44].\nTheorem 1.2.2. Assuming that B 2,s exists with the properties conjectured in [9, 10],\nwe have\nB 2,s \u2243 B\u0303 2,s .\n(1)\n\nFurther elucidating the stucture of B 2,s for type Dn , we define in Section 2.2\na new generalization of Young tableaux and show that it can be used to index the\nvertices of B 2,s . We also give an explicit definition of the affine Kashiwara operators\non these tableaux. We encapsulate these results as follows.\nTheorem 1.2.3. The tableaux defined in Definition 3.2.1 are in bijective correspondence with the tableaux used to index the classical components of B 2,s . Furthermore,\nAlgorithm 3.2.17 explicitly specifies the action of the Kashiwara operators e0 and f0\non these tableaux.\nFinally, we confirm a conjecture of Stembridge on the local structure of crystals\ncoming from representations of doubly laced algebras [47].\n\n\f1.2. Summary of Main Results\n\n8\n\nTheorem 1.2.4. Let g be a doubly laced algebra, i.e., an algebra all of its regular\nrank 2 subalgebras are of type A1 \u00d7 A1 , A2 , or C2 . Let B be the crystal graph of an\nirreducible highest weight module of g, and let v be a vertex of B such that ei v 6= 0\nand ej v 6= 0, where ei and ej denote two different Kashiwara raising operators. Then\none of the following is true:\n1. ei ej v = ej ei v,\n2. ei e2j ei v = ej e2i ej v and no other sequences of the operators ei , ej with length less\nthan or equal to four satisfy such an equality,\n3. ei e3j ei v = ej ei ej ei ej v = e2j e2i ej v and no other sequences of the operators ei , ej\nwith length less than or equal to five satisfy such an equality,\n4. ei e3j e2i ej v = ei e2j ei ej ei ej v = ej e2i e3j ei v = ej ei ej ei e2j ei v and no other sequences\nof the operators ei , ej with length less than or equal to seven satisfy such an\nequality.\nThe equivalent statement with fi and fj in place of ei and ej also holds.\n\n1.2.1\n\nOutline by chapter\n\nIn Chapter 2, we include in the first section all the necessary prerequisite constructions and well-known theorems on quantum groups and crystal bases, including perfect crystals. In section 2.2 we go into more detail on type D crystals, specifying\nthe combinatorics of representations of even orthogonal algebras and specializing the\nconjectures on finite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras to the type\n(1)\n\nDn case. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 contain a detailed analysis of the affine crystals that\nare supposed to exist by these conjectures, and we present our conjecture on the exact\nstructure of these crystals.\n\n\f1.2. Summary of Main Results\n\n9\n\nIn Chapter 3, we begin by specializing the work of the last two sections to the\ncase of r = 2 in section 3.1. We extend these results in section 3.2 by constructing\nan explicit bijection between classical tableaux and what we define to be \"affine\ntableaux\". In section 3.3 we prove Theorem 1.2.2. This chapter is based on [44].\nIn Chapter 4 we deal with local properties of highest weight crystals coming from\nrepresentations of some classes of Lie algebras. In section 4.1, we recall the previously\nknown case of simply laced crystals. Section 4.2 is a review of the combinatorics of\ntype C2 crystals. Proceding to section 4.3, we analyze a generic C2 crystal to see what\nits neighborhood in the crystal graph may look like. In section 4.4, we prove that\nonly four possible local behaviors may appear in doubly laced crystals. This chapter\nis based on [47].\nFinally, Chapter 5 deals with the software package CrystalView, detailing requirements, user input options, current limitations of the software, and a description of\nthe algorithms used to generate the output of this program.\n\n\f10\n\nChapter 2\nCrystals for Kirillov-Reshetikhin\nModules over Quantum Affine\n(1)\n\nAlgebras of Type Dn\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nReview of Quantum Groups and Crystal Bases\nQuantum groups\n\nFor n \u2208 Z and a formal parameter q, we use the notation\nq n \u2212 q \u2212n\n,\n[n]q =\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\n\u0014 \u0015\n[m]q !\nm\n=\n[k]q , and\n[n]q ! =\n.\nn\n[n]\nq ![m \u2212 n]q !\nq\nk=1\nn\nY\n\nThese are all elements of Q(q), called the q-integers, q-factorials, and q-binomial\ncoefficients, respectively.\nLet g be an arbitrary Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum (A, \u03a0, \u03a0\u2228, P, P \u2228)\nand a Dynkin diagram indexed by I.

Lusztig [32] showed that the integrable highest weight\nrepresentations of U(g) can be deformed to Uq (g) representations in such a way that\nthe dimension of the weight spaces are invariant under the deformation, provided\nq 6= 0 and q k 6= 1 for all k \u2208 Z (see also [11]). Let M be a Uq (g)-module and R\nthe subset of all elements in Q(q) which are regular at q = 0. Kashiwara [18, 19]\nintroduced Kashiwara operators \u1ebdi and f \u0303i as certain linear combinations of powers of\nei and fi . In the sequel we will use the notation ei and fi to refer to the Kashiwara\noperators, rather than the standard generators of Uq (g). A crystal lattice L is a free\nR-submodule of M that generates M over Q(q), has the same weight decomposition\nand has the property that ei L \u2282 L and fi L \u2282 L for all i \u2208 I.

These properties ensure that\nperfect crystals can be used to construct the path realization of crystals for highest\nweight modules by taking the semi-infinite tensor product of these crystals [17]. To\ndefine them, we need a few preliminary definitions.\nRecall that P denotes the weight lattice of a Kac-Moody algebra g; for the remainder of this section, g is of affine type.

These Lecouvey relations generalize the Knuth relations governing the RSK correspondence. Note that\nwe write the letters of our words in reverse of the order used in [29]. An admissible column is one whose column word C = xL xL\u22121 * * * x1 is such that xi+1 6\u2264 xi for\ni = 1, . . . , L \u2212 1. Note that the letters n and n\u0304 are the only letters that may appear\nmore than once in C. Let z \u2264 n be a letter in C.

It is noted in [29] that a general type D sliding algorithm, if one exists, would\nbe very complicated. However, for tableaux with no more than two rows, we can\nderive such an algorithm, the details of which are given in Section 3.1.\n\n2.2.4\n\nDual crystals\n\nLet \u03c90 be the longest element in the Weyl group of Dn .

In addition to the\nexistence, Hatayama et al. [9] conjectured certain properties of B r,s which we state\nhere.\n(1)\n\nConjecture 2.2.5 ([9]). If the crystal B r,s of type Dn exists, it has the following\nproperties:\n\n\f2.2. Preliminaries on Type Dn crystals\n\n25\n\nL\n1.

The decomposition of these Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules as modules\nover the embedded classical algebra of type Dn specified by Item 1 of Conjecture\n2.2.5 was confirmed for the case of untwisted algebras in [2] and for twisted algebras\nin [35]; therefore if the crystals exist, this is known to be true.\nRemark 2.2.7. In [7], it is proved that given the following assumptions, the affine\nstructure of B r,s is specified by the embedding of certain Demazure crystals in B r,s .\nWe specialize their statement to the type D case.\n1. B r,s is a regular crystal (i.e., eliminating all edges of color {i1 , . . . , im } \u2282 I\nresults in a crystal over gI\\{i1 ,...,im } ),\n2.

Let J \u2282 I, and denote by BJ the graph that results\nfrom removing all j-colored edges from B r,s for j \u2208 J. Then as directed graphs, B{0}\n\n(which has the structure of a Dn crystal) is isomorphic to B{1} . This motivates the\nintroduction of the \"branching component graph\" of B r,s in Definition 2.3.1 below,\nwhich records all the relevant information about B{0,1} .\nIt is easy to see that the connected components of B{0,1} will be Dn\u22121 -crystals\nwhose highest weights correspond to partitions as characterized by the propositions\nbelow. The branching component graph for B r,s , which we denote BC(B r,s ), is determined by this decomposition. We will describe the decomposition into irreducible\nDn\u22121 -crystals of a Dn -crystal indexed by a partition \u03bb whose complement in an r \u00d7 s\nrectangle is tiled by vertical dominos, calling the resulting graph BC(\u03bb). Given the\nresult of Chari specifying the decomposition of B r,s as a module over the classical\nalgebra, BC(B r,s ) is simply the union of these graphs.\nDefinition 2.3.1. Let \u03bb be a partition labeling a Dn highest weight. The branching\ncomponent graph BC(\u03bb) has one vertex for each connected Dn\u22121 -crystal that results\nfrom removing the 1 arrows from B(\u03bb). We associate to each vertex the partition\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n27\n\ncorresponding to the Dn\u22121 highest weight of that crystal. For a vertex v \u2208 BC(\u03bb), let\nB(v) denote the set of crystal vertices in B(\u03bb) contained in the Dn\u22121 -crystal indexed\nby v. Then BC(\u03bb) has an edge from v to w if there is a crystal vertex b \u2208 B(v) such\nthat f1 (b) \u2208 B(w).\nThis definition is essentially a refinement of the classically known Dn to Dn\u22121\nbranching rule, which is as follows: let \u039b be a Dn dominant weight with no spin\npart (i.e., such that hhn , \u039bi = hhn\u22121 , \u039bi = 0) and let V\u039b denote the irreducible Dn\nmodule with highest weight \u039b. Recall that we may interpret \u039b as a partition with\nhhi , \u039bi columns of height i. A horizontal strip is a subset H of a partition \u03bb such that\ndistinct elements of H are in distinct columns of \u03bb and \u03bb\\H is a partition. Then as a\nDn\u22121 module, V\u039b is the direct sum of Dn\u22121 modules V\u03bc with Dn\u22121 highest weight \u03bc\nfor each \u03bc that can be obtained by successively removing two horizontal strips from\n\u039b. As an illustration, see Example 2.3.3. This rule can be obtained by combining the\nDn to Bn\u22121 branching rule with the Bn\u22121 to Dn\u22121 branching rule [8].\nThis motivates the following definition, formulated by Schilling and Shimozono\n[43].\nDefinition 2.3.2. Consider a sequence of partitions \u03bb \u2282 \u03bc \u2282 \u039b such that \u03bc/\u03bb and\n\u039b/\u03bc are horizontal strips. A \u00b1 diagram D of shape \u039b/\u03bb is the partition \u039b with a\n+'s in each box of \u03bc/\u03bb and \u2212's in each box of \u039b/\u03bc. We call \u039b = outer(D) and\n\u03bb = inner(D) the outer and inner shape of D, respectively.\nThe set of \u00b1 diagrams with outer shape \u039b is in natural bijection with the Dn\u22121\nhighest weights of the Dn\u22121 to Dn branching components of the Dn module V (\u039b);\ni.e., as Dn\u22121 modules we have the following isomorphism:\nVDn (\u039b) \u223c\n=\n\nM\n\nVDn\u22121 (inner(D)),\n\n\u00b1 diagrams D\n\nouter(D)=\u039b\n\nwhere the subscript on V indicates the algebra that defines the representation.\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n28\n\nExample 2.3.3. Consider the Dn module with highest weight \u039b2 + \u039b4 , which corresponds to the partition (2, 2, 1, 1). As a Bn\u22121 module, this is the multiplicity-free\nsum of the modules labeled by (2, 2, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 1), and (2, 1, 1, 0). As a\nDn\u22121 module, it is the sum of the modules associated with the following partitions\nwith the given multiplicities.\nPartition\n\nMultiplicity\n\n(2, 2, 1, 1)\n\n1\n\n(2, 2, 1)\n\n2\n\n(2, 1, 1, 1)\n\n2\n\n(2, 1, 1)\n\n4\n\n(2, 2)\n\n1\n\n(2, 1)\n\n2\n\n(1, 1, 1, 1)\n\n1\n\n(1, 1, 1)\n\n2\n\n(1, 1)\n\n1\n\nThis correspondence is made explicit by the following algorithm.\nAlgorithm 2.3.4. Let d be the difference between the number of +'s and the number\nof \u2212's in the \u00b1 diagram.\n1. Place the maximal number of 1's and 1\u0304's in the diagram such that:\n\u2022 the difference between the number of 1's and the number of 1\u0304's is d,\n\u2022 the 1\u0304's are placed in boxes containing \u2212's, starting from the right, and\n\u2022 the result is a legal tableau;\n2. given that all letters 1, 1\u0304, 2, 2\u0304, . . . , i \u2212 1, i \u2212 1 have been placed, fill the empty\nboxes of row i \u2212 1 with i's;\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n29\n\n3. place the maximal number of i's in row i and \u012b's in the unfilled boxes with \u2212's,\nrespectively, such that\n\u2022 the resulting i-weight of the tableau agrees with the inner shape of the \u00b1\ndiagram,\n\u2022 the \u012b's are placed in boxes containing \u2212's, starting from the right, and\n\u2022 the result is a legal tableau.\nProposition 2.3.5. Algorithm 2.3.4 bijectively maps the set of \u00b1 diagrams of shape\n\u039b to the set of Dn\u22121 highest weight tableaux of shape \u039b.\nProof. The output of the algorithm is easily verified to be a Dn\u22121 highest weight\ntableaux. The classical branching rule tells us that there are precisely as many such\ntableaux as \u00b1 diagrams. By the pigeonhole principle, this correspondence must be\nbijective.\nThe notion of \"\u03b11 -height\" of a Dn\u22121 irreducible component B(\u03bb) as a subset of a\nDn crystal B(\u039b) will play a crucial role in our understanding of branching component\ngraphs. There are three equivalent ways to understand this statistic, each of which is\nuseful in certain contexts.\nLet T be an arbitrary element of B(\u03bb) \u2282 B(\u039b). The definition of the \u03b11 -height\nof B(\u03bb) is simply the value of hh1 , \u03bci where \u03bc is the Dn weight of T . This is equal\nto the difference between the number of columns of \u039b and the number of 1-arrows\nin a minimal path in the crystal graph between the highest weight tableau and T .\nFinally, we can also take this to be the number of 1's minus the number of 1\u0304's in T ,\nwhich is also the difference between +'s and \u2212's in the \u00b1 diagram corresponding to\nB(\u03bb). In Algorithm 2.3.4, this is the statistic d.\nBecause the edges of the branching component graph indicate the action of f1 ,\nwhich decreases the \u03b11 -height by 1, this graph is the Hasse diagram of a ranked poset.\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n30\n\nTo avoid confusion with algebra rank, we use the term \"stratum\" to describe the poset\nranks. Uniformly labeling the strata by their \u03b11 -height, we have that the stratum that\nis equidistant from the \"highest weight\" and \"lowest weight\" branching component\nvertices is designated \"stratum 0\"; the strata in the direction of the highest weight\nvertex are labeled by consecutive positive integers, those in the opposite direction by\nnegative integers.\nProposition 2.3.6. If \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbl ), then BC(\u03bb) has 2\u03bb1 + 1 strata. Furthermore, the partitions labeling stratum j also label stratum \u2212j for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bb1 , including\nmultiplicities.\nProof. The first of these follows from the observation that the \u03b11 -height ranges from\n\u03bb1 to \u2212\u03bb1 in increments of 1. The second claim is a consequence of the symmetry of\nthe weight lattice of any classical finite dimensional representation.\nIt therefore suffices to describe strata 0 through \u03bb1 for any BC(\u03bb), appealing to\nsymmetry for the negative strata.\nProposition 2.3.7. Let v and w be vertices of a branching component graph with an\nedge between them. Then the partitions associated to v and w are adjacent in Young's\nlattice; i.e., they differ by a single box.\nProof. Observe that the Kashiwara operator f1 only changes a single box of a tableau,\neither changing a 1 to a 2 or a 2\u0304 to a 1\u0304. It follows that the edges of the branching\ncomponent graph only connect partitions that differ by a single box. In the case\nof changing a 1 to a 2, the partition associated with the new branching component\nvertex has one more box than the old one if the \u2212 in the 2-signature from the new 2\nis unbracketed; otherwise it has one less box. Conversely, when changing a 2\u0304 to a 1\u0304,\nthe partition associated with the new branching component vertex has one less box\nthan the old one if the + in the 2 signature from the disappearing 2\u0304 is unbracketed;\notherwise it has one more box.\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n31\n\nWhen characterizing branching component graphs, it therefore suffices to show\nthat all edges described in the statements of Proposition 2.3.8 and Conjecture 2.3.11\nare in fact present. We do not need to show that pairs of vertices whose partitions\ndiffer by more than one box are non-adjacent.\n\n2.3.2\n\nRectangular partitions\n\nProposition 2.3.8. Let \u03bb = (s, s, . . . , s) be a k \u00d7 s rectangle. Then BC(\u03bb) is as\nfollows: stratum s of BC(\u03bb) has a single vertex, which is labeled by a (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 s\nrectangle. The vertices of stratum j \u2212 1 for j \u2265 1 are labeled by one of each partition\ncontained in \u03bb that differs from some partition in stratum j by a single box and whose\nfirst k \u2212 2 parts are s. Two vertices in strata j and j \u2212 1 labeled by partitions \u03bc1 and\n\u03bc2 have an edge between them if \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are adjacent in Young's lattice.\nBefore proving this statement we examine the top two strata of BC(s\u031f2 ) in detail.\nThe highest weight branching component vertex (i.e., the branching component vertex\ncontaining the highest weight vertex) is indexed by the one-part partition (s). To see\n1\n1\nthat this is true, simply observe that the highest weight tableau of B(s\u031f2 ) is * * * ,\n|2 {z 2}\ns\n\nand acting by f2 , . . . , fn in the most general possible way will affect only the bottom\n\nrow. When we map these bottom row subtableaux componentwise by a 7\u2192 a \u2212 1 and\n\u0101 7\u2192 a \u2212 1 to tableaux of shape (s), and apply the same map to the colors of the\narrows, this is clearly isomorphic to the Dn\u22121 -crystal with highest weight s\u031f1 .\nAccording to Algorithm 2.3.4 and the Dn to Dn\u22121 branching rule, the two Dn\u22121\nhighest weight tableaux in stratum s \u2212 1 are\n1 1 *** 1 2\n2 2 *** 2 3\n\nand\n\n1 1 *** 1 2\n\n.\n\n2 2 * * * 2 2\u0304\n\nIn the former case, the operators f2 , . . . , fn act freely on the bottom row and the\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n32\n\nrighmost box in the top row; in the latter case, they act on all boxes in the bottom\nrow except the rightmost, since fi , ei for i = 2, . . . , n do not act on the last column.\nIt follows that the corresponding partitions are (s, 1) and (s \u2212 1), with respective \u00b1\ndiagrams\n***\n+ *** + +\n\nand\n\n***\n\n+\n\n.\n\n+ + *** + \u2212\n\nNow, observe what can result from acting on a tableau T =\n\na1\nb1\n\n* * * abss in the highest\n\nweight branching component vertex by f1 . Since a1 = * * * = as = 1, as will turn into\na 2. There are two cases to consider: if bs = 2\u0304, this results in a tableau with a\nconfiguration\n\n2\n2\u0304\n\nat the right end; otherwise, it is a tableau with a1 = * * * = as\u22121 = 1\n\nwhere some element of Dn\u22121 can act on the rightmost column. It follows that there\nare edges from the vertex in stratum s to both of the vertices in stratum s \u2212 1.\nProof of Proposition 2.3.8. The number of each partition and their strata follow from\nAlgorithm 2.3.4 and the Dn to Dn\u22121 branching rule. Explicitly, consider the content\nof stratum j, which is determined by the set of \u00b1 diagrams such that the difference\nbetween the number of +'s and the number of \u2212's is j. Thanks to Proposition 2.3.6,\nwe may assume j \u2265 0. Because we currently only consider rectangular partitions, the\npossible configurations of +'s and \u2212's can be explicitly characterized. First, we have\nl columns with only a + in the last row with j \u2264 l \u2264 s. We furthermore have l \u2212 j\ncolumns with only a \u2212 in the last row, located immediately to the right of the columns\nwith only a +. Finally, we may have between 0 and s \u2212 2l + j columns with a \u00b1 pair\nin the last two rows, located immediately to the right of the columns with only a \u2212\nand extending to the right edge of the rectangle. The choices of the number of +'s\nand \u00b1 columns are independent of each other up to the bounds described above. In\nother words, stratum j has one vertex for each partition contained in a k \u00d7s rectangle\nsuch that the first k \u2212 2 parts are s, the last part is no greater than s \u2212 j, and the\ndifference between the size of the partition and k \u00d7 s is congruent mod 2 to j. This\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n33\n\nis equivalent to the characterization of vertices prescribed by Proposition 2.3.8; i.e.,\nthose partitions contained in a k \u00d7 s rectangle such that the first k \u2212 2 parts are s\nand which differ from a (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 s rectangle by s \u2212 j additions or removals of boxes\nin the last two rows.\nTo show that the edges of this graph are as prescribed by Proposition 2.3.8, we\nexplicitly construct tableaux with the following properties. Each of these tableaux\nis in a Dn\u22121 crystal whose highest weight corresponds to a partition that can have\na box added in at least one of the last two rows. We will then show that acting by\nthe Kashiwara operator f1 produces a tableau in a Dn\u22121 crystal whose highest weight\ncorresponds to the partition with one of the last two rows augmented thusly.\nThe claims that f1 may also have the effect of removing a box from one of the\nlast two rows of the partition labeling its Dn\u22121 crystal's highest weight follows by the\n\u2217-duality of the crystal. To see this, let v be a branching component vertex labeled\nby a partition \u03bc such that \u03bck \u2265 1 (and consequently j, the stratum of v, is at least\n\u2212s+1); we wish to show that there is an edge from v to w, where w is in stratum j \u22121\nand its partition differs from \u03bc only by diminishing the last part by one. We know\nthat there is a vertex v \u2032 also labeled by \u03bc in stratum \u2212j called the complementary\nvertex of v; the vertices in B(v \u2032 ) are precisely the image under the \u2217 map of the\nvertices in B(v). We know from the above paragraph that v \u2032 has an incoming edge\nfrom w \u2032 , the complementary vertex of w . This means that for some crystal vertex\nb \u2208 B(w \u2032 ), we know that f1 b \u2208 B(v \u2032 ). It follows that e1 (b\u2217 ) \u2208 B(v) and b\u2217 \u2208 B(w),\nand we thus conclude that there is an edge from v to w. An identical argument shows\nthat a branching component vertex v in stratum j \u2265 \u2212s + 1 labeled by a partition \u03bc\nsuch that \u03bck\u22121 \u2265 \u03bck + 1 has an edge to the vertex w in stratum j \u2212 1 whose partition\ndiffers from \u03bc only by diminishing the penultimate part by one.\nWe now construct tableaux such that the action of the Kashiwara operator f1 has\nthe described effect on the branching component vertices. We begin by constructing\n\n\f2.3. A Dynkin Diagram Automorphism and the Branching Component Graph\n\n34\n\nan arbitrary Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau, as given by Algorithm 2.3.4.

This tableau corresponds\nby Algorithm 2.3.4 to the \u00b1 diagram with s1 columns with a +, s4 \u2212 s2 columns with\na \u2212, and s2 columns with a \u00b1 pair.

In\nthis case we must have s2 + s3 \u2264 s4 . To make the second case exclusive of the first,\nwe add the requirement that \u03b4 + s3 > 0.\nConsider the action on these tableaux of the sequence f1 f2 * * * fk\u22121 .

We therefore know that this sequence acts entirely on the (s1 + s2 )th column,\ncounting from the left. It has the effect of increasing by 1 each entry in this column\nexcept the bottom entry, resulting in the Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau with Dn\u22121\nweight (s2 \u2212 1)\u031fk\u22122 + (s1 + s4 \u2212 s2 + 1)\u031fk\u22121 + (s2 + s3 )\u031fk .\nIn the second case, we consider the subcases of \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b4 = 1. If \u03b4 = 0,\nwe have s3 6= 0, and the sequence f1 f2 * * * fk\u22121 acts entirely on the (s1 + s2 + s3 )th\ncolumn, counting from the left, resulting in the Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau with\nDn\u22121 weight (s2 + 2s3 \u2212 1)\u031fk\u22122 + (s1 + s4 \u2212 s2 \u2212 s3 + 1)\u031fk\u22121 + s2 \u031fk . On the\nother hand, if \u03b4 = 1, this sequence acts entirely on the letter in the bottom row\nof the \"\u03b4\" column, giving us the Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau with Dn\u22121 weight\n(s2 + 2s3 )\u031fk\u22122 + (s1 + s4 \u2212 s2 \u2212 s3 + 1)\u031fk\u22121 + s2 \u031fk .\nIn any case, we have constructed a tableau (namely, f2 f3 * * * fk\u22121 applied to a Dn\u22121\nhighest weight tableau) such that acting by f1 adds a box to the penultimate row of\nthe partition associated to its branching component vertex, according to Algorithm\n2.3.4.\nMoving our attention to adding a box in the last row, consider the tableau that\nresults from applying the sequence of operators\nf2s1 +s4 \u2212s2 f3s1 +s4 \u2212s2 * * * fks1 +s4 \u2212s2\nto our first case of highest weight tableau.

It is included here simply to present as much\ninformation as possible about branching component graphs. Also note that the statements regarding the vertices and their associated Dn\u22121 weights is proved; only the\nproperties of edges are conjectural.\nConjecture 2.3.11. Let \u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) be partitions, let l(\u03bb(2) ) denote the number of parts\n(1)\n\nof \u03bb(2) , and let m1\n(1)\n\nm1 \u2212 2.\n\n(1)\n\ndenote the multiplicity of \u03bb1\n\nin \u03bb(1) . Suppose that l(\u03bb(2) ) \u2264\n\nLet \u03bb(1) \u03bb(2) denote the horizontal concatenation of \u03bb(1) and \u03bb(2) ; i.e.\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(\u03bb(1) \u03bb(2) )i = \u03bbi + \u03bbi .

Suppose\nthat \u03bc = \u03bc(1) \u03bc(2) is a partition such that in BC(\u03bb(1) ) and BC(\u03bb(2) ), at least one of \u03bc(1)\nor \u03bc(2) has an edge to the partition differing from it by the addition of a box in the\nk th row. Denote the partition differing from \u03bc by the addition of a box in the k th row\nby \u03bc+k . Our conjecture breaks into two cases. If k is not congruent modulo 2 to the\nnumber of parts of \u03bb, we claim that the sequence\n\nf1 f2 * * * fk\n\napplied to the Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau of B(\u03bc) produces the Dn\u22121 highest weight\ntableau of B(\u03bc+k ). Otherwise, k is congruent modulo 2 to the number of parts of \u03bb.\nLet r be the number of columns of height k in \u03bc.

Compare these statements to those of Proposition 2.3.8.\nThe heuristic for these to be separate cases is that the first corresponds to removing\nthe + from a \u00b1 pair in a single column, whereas the second case corresponds to\nremoving a + from a column where it was alone.\n\nProposition 2.3.8 and Conjecture 2.3.11 characterize all branching component\ngraphs in our current scope of interest, since for a classical component B(\u03bc) to be in\nB r,s , the complement of \u03bc in an r \u00d7 s rectangle must be tileable by vertical dominos.\n\n\f2.4. The Crystal Automorphism\n\n2.4\n\n42\n\nThe Crystal Automorphism\n\nRecall that the automorphism \u03c3 : B r,s \u2192 B r,s , where B r,s is taken as a Dn\u22121 -crystal,\n(1)\n\ncorresponds to the Dn Dynkin diagram automorphism interchanging nodes 0 and 1.\nAs a result, we know that \u03c3 must be a crystal isomorphism when restricted to any\nDn\u22121 -crystal corresponding to a vertex in BC(B r,s ). We may therefore describe \u03c3 by\nfirst specifying a shape-preserving automorphism \u03c3\u030c of BC(B r,s ), then defining \u03c3 to\nbe the union of the corresponding crystal isomorphisms.\nTo explicitly determine \u03c3(b) from \u03c3\u030c for any b \u2208 B r,s , let v be the branching component vertex such that b \u2208 B(v), and let Tv denote the Dn\u22121 -highest weight vertex\nof B(v). We know that for some finite sequence i1 , . . . , ik of integers in {2, . . . , n},\nwe have fi1 * * * fik Tv = b. Let T\u03c3\u030c(v) be the highest weight vector of B(\u03c3\u030c(v)). For any\nsuch sequence of integers, we may define \u03c3(b) = fi1 * * * fik T\u03c3\u030c(v) .\nProposition 2.4.1. Let b \u2208 B r,s , and suppose f0 (b) 6= 0. Then the stratum of f0 (b)\nmust be one greater than the stratum of b, and therefore the map \u03c3\u030c must send a vertex\nfrom stratum j to a vertex in stratum \u2212j.\nProof. Recall from the weight structure of type D algebras that \u03b10 = 2\u039b0 \u2212 \u031f2 and\nwt(f0 (b)) = wt(b) \u2212 \u03b10 . Define cw(b) = wt(b) \u2212 (\u03c60 (b) \u2212 \u03b50 (b))\u039b0 . The above implies\nthat cw(f0 (b)) = cw(b) + \u031f2 = cw(b) + (e1 + e2 ), where e1 , e2 are the first and second\nelementary basis vectors in the weight space. Similarly, cw(fi (b)) = cw(b) \u2212 \u03b1i for\ni = 1, . . . , n, so that among f1 , . . . , fn , only f1 changes the e1 component of a weight\nby \u22121. Since f1 decreases the stratum by one and f0 changes the e1 component of a\nweight by +1, it follows that f0 increases the stratum by one.\nRecall that \u00b1 diagrams can be used to label vertices of BC(B r,s ). We state a\nconjectural construction of \u03c3\u030c due to Schilling and Shimozono [43] defined in terms of\n\u00b1 diagrams that satisfies the condition of Proposition 2.4.1.\n\n\f2.4. The Crystal Automorphism\n\n43\n\nConjecture 2.4.2. Let D be a \u00b1 diagram of shape \u039b/\u03bb such that the complement of\n\u2212\n\u00b1\n\u039b in an r \u00d7 s rectangle can be tiled by vertical dominos. Let m\u25e6i , m+\ni , mi and mi\n\ndenote the number of columns of height i in D with no symbol, a +, a \u2212, and a \u00b1\npair, respectively. If r is even, set m\u25e60 = s \u2212 \u039b1 . Note that if i \u2261 r + 1 (mod 2) then\nm\u2217i = 0 for \u2217 \u2208 {\u25e6, +, \u2212, \u00b1}. Then \u03c3\u030c(D) is the \u00b1 diagram with m\u00b1\ni+2 empty columns\n+\nof height i, m\u2212\ni columns of height i with a +, mi columns of height i with a \u2212, and\n\nm\u25e6i columns of height i + 2 with a \u00b1 pair for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\nThis conjectural \u03c3\u030c also respects a symmetry that appears in the poset of Dn\ncomponents of B r,s . To state this precisely, we need to know which Dn components\nof B r,s have \u03bc as a Dn\u22121 highest weight. In other words, we want to know for which\nouter shapes \u039b there is a \u00b1 diagram with inner shape \u03bc. The smallest such partition,\nwhich we denote by \u03bc0\u0302 , is the outer shape of the \u00b1 diagram with inner shape \u03bc none\nof whose columns have a \u00b1 pair. Complementarily, the largest such partition, which\nwe denote by \u03bc1\u0302 , is the outer shape of the \u00b1 diagram of which \u03bc is the inner shape\nand such that every column of height less than r has at least one + or one \u2212 in it.\nIt is also the result of adding a vertical domino with a \u00b1 pair to those columns of \u03bc0\u0302\nthat have fewer than r boxes and do not have a + or \u2212 in them.\nRemark 2.4.3. In the above, \u03bc0\u0302 and \u03bc1\u0302 depend on the parity of r.\nExample 2.4.4. Consider those classical components B(\u03bb) of B 4,4 for which \u03bc =\n(2, 1) is associated with a vertex of BC(\u03bb). The smallest such \u03bb is \u03bc0\u0302 = (2, 2); the\nlargest is \u03bc1\u0302 = (4, 4, 1, 1). The intermediate partitions are (2, 2, 1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 3, 1, 1),\nand (4, 4).\nGiven a partition \u03bb whose complement is tiled by vertical dominos, let \u03bb\u0304 be the\npartition whose columns have length equal to the floor of half the length of the\ncolumns of \u03bb. In words, \u03bb\u0304 is the result of including only every other part of \u03bb,\nomitting the first part if \u03bb has an odd number of parts. It is easy to see that \u03bc0\u0302\n\n\f2.4.

Consider the multiset\nof rows with boxes in \u03bc1\u0302 /\u03bc0\u0302 . Taking the complement in this multiset provides a\ncanonical symmetry of this interval. Explicitly, define the map t from this interval to\nitself by saying that both \u03bb/\u03bc0\u0302 and \u03bc1\u0302 /t(\u03bb) must have mi boxes in row i.\nConjecture 2.4.2 implies that \u03c3\u030c respects this symmetry. Observe that the outer\nshape of \u03c3\u030c(D) differs from outer(D) by replacing m\u00b1\ni columns with \u00b1 pairs by ci\u22122 \u2212\nm\u00b1\ni many such columns when i \u2261 r(mod2). This is precisely the same involution of\nthe interval as t in the above paragraph.\nExample 2.4.5. Consider \u03bc = (2, 1) in B 4,4 as in Example 2.4.4 above. The interval\nbetween \u03bc0\u0302 and \u03bc1\u0302 is shown in figure 2.4.1.\nIn the case of r = 2 these intervals are simply linear orderings, and Conjecture\n2.4.2 has been proved in this special case (Theorem 1.2.2; see Section 3.3). This\nsymmetry appears to be the only generally consistent procedure for determining what\nthe classical component of \u03c3\u030c(v) should be, and it is the most natural generalization\nof the behavior of \u03c3\u030c in the case of B 2,s .\nWe have now defined \u03c3\u030c on BC(B r,s ), which in turn defines \u03c3 on B r,s .\n(1)\n\nConjecture 2.4.6 (Restatement of Conjecture 1.2.1).

Condition 1 is satisfied since the relation \u2264 on our alphabet is transitive.\n\nConditions 2 and 5 are automatically satisfied, since the columns that remain are not\nchanged. Condition 3 is satisfied since by Proposition 3.2.2, there can be no more\nthan one a-configuration in T .

We will show that if\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 to t does not produce a tableau in T (s) \\ B(s\u031f2 ), then appending\n\n* * * \u0101akk to t will produce a tableau in T (s) \\ B(s\u031f2 ). There are two reasons we might\n\nnot be able to prepend\n\nb\u03041\nb1\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 ; b1 may be unbarred, or we may have a1 < b\u03041 .\n\nFirst, suppose b1 is unbarred. If bk is also unbarred, then bk is certainly less than\n\u0101k , so we may append\n\nak\n\u0101k\n\n* * * \u0101akk to t. Hence, suppose that bk is barred. We will show\n\nthat ak is unbarred and \u0101k > bk .\nWe know that t has a subtableau of the form\n\nai ai+1\nbi bi+1\n\nsuch that bi is unbarred\n\nand bi+1 is barred. It follows that ai is unbarred, and therefore \u0101i > bi . Since\nour hypothesis states that\n\nai ai+1\nbi bi+1\n\nmust not satisfy Criterion 3.2.5, this means that\n\n\u0101i > bi+1 , which is equivalent to b\u0304i+1 > ai . Once again observing that\n\nai ai+1\nbi bi+1\n\ndoes\n\nnot satisfy Criterion 3.2.5, this implies that b\u0304i+1 > ai+1 ; i.e., ai+1 is unbarred, and\n\u0101i+1 > bi+1 .\nWe proceed with an inductive argument on i < j < k. Suppose that\n\naj aj+1\nbj bj+1\n\nis a\n\nsubtableau of t such that bj and bj+1 are barred, aj is unbarred, and \u0101j > bj . By\nreasoning identical to the above, we conclude that\n\n\u0101j > bj+1 \u21d2 b\u0304j+1 > aj \u21d2 b\u0304j+1 > aj+1 \u21d2 \u0101j+1 > bj+1 ,\n\n(3.2.1)\n\nwhich once again means that aj+1 is unbarred.\nThis inductively shows that ak is unbarred and \u0101k > bk , so we may append\n\nak\n\u0101k\n\n* * * \u0101akk\n\nto t to get a tableau in T (s) \\ B(s\u031f2 ). By a symmetrical argument, we conclude that\nif ak is barred, then we may prepend\n\nb\u03041\nb1\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 to t.\n\nNow, suppose that b1 is barred and b\u03041 > a1 . This means that a1 is unbarred and\n\u01011 > b1 , so the induction carried out in equation 3.2.1 applies. It follows that ak\nis unbarred and \u0101k > bk , so once again we may append\n\nak\n\u0101k\n\n* * * a\u0101kk to t. Also, by a\n\nsymmetrical argument, when ak is unbarred and bk > \u0101k , we may prepend\n\nb\u03041\nb1\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 to\n\n\f3.2. Realization of B 2,s as a Set of Young-like Tableaux\n\n55\n\nt. Thus, when no subtableau of t satisfy Criterion 3.2.5, either appending\nprepending\n\nb\u03041\nb1\n\nak\n\u0101k\n\n* * * \u0101akk or\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 to t will produce a tableau in T (s) \\ B(s\u031f2 ).\n\nLemma 3.2.8. Any tableau t =\n\na1\nb1\n\n* * * abkk \u2208\n\nLs\u22121\n\nk=0 B(k\u031f2 )\n\nhas no more than two filling\n\nlocations. If it has two, they are consecutive integers, and F2,s (t) doesn't depend on\nthis choice.\nProof. Let 0 \u2264 i\u2217 \u2264 k be minimal such that i\u2217 is a filling location of t. First assume\nthat 0 < i\u2217 < k. This implies the existence of a subtableau\n\nai\u2217 ai\u2217 +1\nbi\u2217 bi\u2217 +1\n\nwhich satisfies\n\nCriterion 3.2.5.\nSuppose that the first condition bi\u2217 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1 of Criterion 3.2.5 is satisfied,\nand consider whether i\u2217 + 1 can be a filling location. If bi\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 +1 \u2264 bi\u2217 +2 , we have\n\nbi\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1 ,\n\nwhich implies that \u0101i\u2217 = \u0101i\u2217 +1 = bi\u2217 +1 , so that t violates part 3 of Criterion 3.1.1.\nSimilarly, if ai\u2217 +1 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +2 \u2264 ai\u2217 +2 , then we have\n\n\u0101i\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1 \u2264 bi\u2217 +2 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 +1 ,\n\nwhich also implies that \u0101i\u2217 = \u0101i\u2217 +1 = bi\u2217 +1 , once again violating part 3 of Criterion\n3.1.1. We conclude that if i\u2217 is a filling location for which Criterion 3.2.5 is satisfied\nby bi\u2217 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1 , then i\u2217 + 1 is not a filling location. Furthermore, this argument\nshows that ai\u2217 +1 > ai\u2217 or bi\u2217 +1 > \u0101i\u2217 . By the partial ordering on our alphabet, it\nfollows that t has no other filling locations.\nNow, suppose for the filling location i\u2217 , Criterion 3.2.5 is satisfied by ai\u2217 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +1 \u2264\nai\u2217 +1 . The condition ai\u2217 +1 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +2 \u2264 ai\u2217 +2 for i\u2217 + 1 to be a filling location implies\nthat\nb\u0304i\u2217 +2 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +1 \u2264 ai\u2217 +1 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +2 ,\n\n\f3.2. Realization of B 2,s as a Set of Young-like Tableaux\n\n56\n\nwhich as above leads to a violation of part 3 of Criterion 3.1.1. However, i\u2217 + 1 may\nbe a filling location if Criterion 3.2.5 is satisfied by bi\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 +1 \u2264 bi\u2217 +2 . Note that\nthis inequality implies that ai\u2217 +1 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +1 , which tells us that ai\u2217 +1 = b\u0304i\u2217 +1 . Thus,\nchoosing to insert\n\nb\u0304i\u2217 +1\nbi\u2217 +1\n\n+1\n* * * bb\u0304ii\u2217 +1\nbetween columns i\u2217 and i\u2217 +1 or to insert\n\u2217\n\nai\u2217 +1\n\u0101i\u2217 +1\n\n+1\n* * * \u0101aii\u2217 +1\n\u2217\n\nbetween columns i\u2217 + 1 and i\u2217 + 2 does not change F2,s (t). Since i\u2217 + 1 is a filling\nlocation with Criterion 3.2.5 satisfied by bi\u2217 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1 , the preceding paragraph\nimplies that there are no other filling locations in t.\nFinally, suppose that i\u2217 = 0 is a filling location for t; i.e., b1 is barred, a1 is\nunbarred, and b\u03041 \u2264 a1 . If 1 is a filling location, Criterion 3.2.5 is satisfied by b1 \u2264\n\u01011 \u2264 b2 ; otherwise, part 3 of Criterion 3.1.1 is violated. Put together, this means that\n\u01011 = b1 , so prepending\n\nb\u03041\nb1\n\n* * * b\u0304b11 to t and inserting\n\na1\n\u01011\n\n* * * a\u010111 between columns 1 and 2\n\nresults in the same tableau. As in the above cases, part 3 of Criterion 3.1.1 and the\npartial order on the alphabet prohibit any other filling locations.\nExample 3.2.9. Let s = 4.

If a filling location of t =\n\na1\nb1\n\n* * * abkk \u2208\n\nLs\u22121\ni=0\n\nB(i\u031f2 ) satisfies Criterion\n\n3.2.5 with both inequalities, then F2,s (t) is independent of this choice.\nProof. Suppose that i\u2217 6= 0, k is a filling location for t where both parts of Criterion\n3.2.5 are satisfied. This means that the subtableau\n\nai\u2217 ai\u2217 +1\nbi\u2217 bi\u2217 +1\n\nsatisfies both \u0101i\u2217 \u2264 bi\u2217 +1\n\nand ai\u2217 \u2264 b\u0304i\u2217 +1 . The latter of these implies that bi\u2217 +1 \u2264 \u0101i\u2217 , so we have \u0101i\u2217 = bi\u2217 +1\nand b\u0304i\u2217 +1 = ai\u2217 . Thus, filling with either\n\nai\u2217\n\u0101i\u2217\n\n* * * \u0101aii\u2217 or\n\ni\u2217 and i\u2217 + 1 results in the same tableau F2,s (t).\n\n\u2217\n\nb\u0304i\u2217 +1\nbi\u2217 +1\n\n+1\n* * * bb\u0304ii\u2217 +1\nbetween columns\n\u2217\n\n\f3.2.

We\nwill use the notation T \u2208 B(k\u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s to indicate this identification.\nLet i1 , i2 \u2208 {0, . . . , s}, and i1 < i2 , so \u03b9ii21 denotes the embedding of B(i1 \u031f2 )\nin B(i2 \u031f2 ). Let T \u2208 B(i1 \u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s . This embedding can be combinatorially\nunderstood through the following observations:\nRemark 3.2.15.\n\u2022 \u03c6k (T ) = \u03c6k (\u03b9ii21 (T )) and \u03b5k (T ) = \u03b5k (\u03b9ii21 (T )) for k = 2, . . . , n;\n\u2022 D2,s (\u03b9ii21 (T )) has (i2 \u2212 i1 ) more columns than D2,s (T ) (section 3.2.1);\n\u2022 v(T ) and v(\u03b9ii21 (T )) are in the same stratum, where v(T ) is the branching component vertex containing T .\nIn other words, we know that T has a maximal a-configuration of size s\u2212i1 (section\n3.2.1), and has completely reduced form T # (Definition 3.1.3). Furthermore, let r1T\nbe the number of 1's in the first row of D2,s (T ) to the left of a null-configuration, let\nr2T be the size of the null-configuration therein, (possibly r2T = 0), and let r3T be\nthe number of 1\u0304's to the right of the null-configuration. We then have t1T = r1T + r2T\nand t2T = r2T + r3T , and the stratum of v(T ) and v(\u03b9ii21 (T )) is t1T \u2212 t2T .\nRemark 3.2.16.

Let T \u2208 B(k\u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s be a tableau whose branching component\nvertex is in stratum j. Then T \u2217BC is the tableau in B(k\u031f2 ) with the same completely\nreduced form as T whose branching component vertex is in stratum \u2212j.\nAlternatively, we can interpret this involution as follows. Let T \u2208 B(v), where\nv is a branching component vertex with Dn\u22121 highest weight tableau u, and whose\ncomplementary vertex is v \u2032 . (Recall from section 2.3 that the complementary vertex\nof v is defined to be the vertex in the opposite stratum from v that is associaated\nwith the same partition as v.) Let i1 , . . . , im be a sequence such that T = fi1 * * * fim u.\nThen T \u2217BC = fi1 * * * fim u\u2032 , where u\u2032 is the Dn\u22121 -highest weight tableau of B(v \u2032 ).\n\n\f3.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\n63\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2.2\nOverview\n\nTo show that B\u0303 2,s is perfect, it must be shown that all criteria of Definition 2.1.1 are\nsatisfied with l = s. We have taken part 3 of Definition 2.1.1 as part of our hypothesis\nfor Theorem 1.2.2, so we do not attempt to prove this here.\nPart 2 of Definition 2.1.1 is satisfied by simply noting that \u03bb = \u031f2 = s\u039b2 \u2212 2s\u039b0\nis a weight in Pcl such that B\u03bb = {us } contains only one crystal vertex and all\nother vertices in B\u0303 2,s have \"lower\" weights, in the ordering designated by part 2 of\nDefinition 2.1.1.\nIn section 3.3.2, we show that B\u0303 2,s \u2297 B\u0303 2,s is connected, proving that part 1 of\nDefinition 2.1.1 is satisfied. Parts 4 and 5 of Definition 2.1.1 will be dealt with\nsimultaneously in sections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5 by examining the levels of tableaux combinatorially. We will see that the level of a generic tableau is at least s and the tableaux\nof level s are in bijection with the level s weights. In section 3.3.6 we show that B\u0303 2,s is\nthe unique affine crystal satsifying the properties of Conjecture 2.2.5 thereby proving\nTheorem 1.2.2.\n\n3.3.2\n\nConnectedness of B\u0303 2,s\n\nLemma 3.3.1 (Part 1 of Definition 2.1.1). The crystal B\u0303 2,s \u2297 B\u0303 2,s is connected as a\n(1)\n\nDn -crystal.\nProof. (This proof is very similar to that of [28, Proposition 5.1].) For k = 0, 1, . . . , s,\nlet uk denote the highest weight vector of the classical component B(k\u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s ,\nas in Lemma 3.2.22. We will show that an arbitrary vertex b \u2297 b\u2032 \u2208 B\u0303 2,s \u2297 B\u0303 2,s is\nconnected to u0 \u2297 u0 .\nWe know that for some j \u2208 {0, . . . , s}, we have b\u2032 \u2208 B(j\u031f2 ). Then for some pair\nof sequences i1 , i2 , . . . , ip (with entries in {1, . . . , n}) and m1 , m2 , . . . , mp (with entries\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n64\nm\n\np\n\u2032\n1\n1 m2\nin Z>0 ) and some b1 \u2208 B\u0303 2,s , we have em\ni1 ei2 * * * eip (b \u2297 b ) = b \u2297 uj .\n\nBy Corollary 3.2.24, \u03c60 (uj ) = s \u2212 j, so if \u03b50 (b1 ) \u2264 s \u2212 j, Lemma 3.2.22 tells us\nthat ej0 (b1 \u2297 uj ) = b1 \u2297 u0 . If \u03b50 (b1 ) = r > s \u2212 j, then er\u2212s+j\n(b1 \u2297 uj ) = b2 \u2297 uj , where\n0\n\u03b50 (b2 ) = r \u2212 (r \u2212 s + j) = s \u2212 j, so ej0 (b2 \u2297 uj ) = b2 \u2297 u0 . In either case, our arbitrary\nb \u2297 b\u2032 is connected to an element of the form b\u2032\u2032 \u2297 u0 .\nLet j \u2032 be such that b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 B(j \u2032 \u031f2 ). Since u0 is the unique element of B(0), the\ncrystal for the trivial representation of Uq (Dn ), we know that B(j \u2032 \u031f2 ) \u2297 B(0) \u2243\nB(j \u2032 \u031f2 ). Therefore, b\u2032\u2032 \u2297 u0 is connected to uj \u2032 \u2297 u0 . Finally, we note that \u03c60 (u0 ) =\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ns < s + j \u2032 = \u03b50 (uj \u2032 ) for j \u2032 6= 0, so ej0 (uj \u2032 \u2297 u0 ) = ej0 (uj \u2032 ) \u2297 u0 = u0 \u2297 u0 , completing\nthe proof.\n\n3.3.3\n\nPreliminary observations\n\nWe first make a few observations.\nProposition 3.3.2. Let T \u2208 B(k\u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s , and set T (m) = \u03b9m\nk (T ) for m \u2208 {l, l +\n1, . . . , s}, where l is minimal such that \u03b9lk (T ) 6= 0. If l 6= s, we have for l \u2264 m < s\n\u03b51 (T (m+1) ) = \u03b51 (T (m) ) + 1 and \u03b50 (T (m+1) ) = \u03b50 (T (m) ) \u2212 1,\n\u03c61 (T (m+1) ) = \u03c61 (T (m) ) + 1 and \u03c60 (T (m+1) ) = \u03c60 (T (m) ) \u2212 1.\nProof. Let l \u2264 m \u2264 s \u2212 1, so \u03b9m+1\nis defined. We first consider the difference between\nm\n(m)\nthe reduced 1-signatures of D2,s (T (m) ) and D2,s (T (m+1) ) = D2,s (\u03b9m+1\n)), since the\nm (T\n\naction of e1 on these tableaux is defined by the action of the classical e1 on their image\nunder D2,s . Let \u2212M +P be the reduced 1-signature of D2,s (T (m) ). Let r1 denote the\nnumber of 1's in D2,s (T (m) ), r3 the number of 1\u0304's, r2 the size of the null-configuration,\nand t1 = r1 + r2 , t2 = r2 + r3 . Then there is a contribution \u2212r2 +r2 to the 1-signature\nfrom the null-configuration, and the remaining \u2212's and +'s come from 1's with a letter\ngreater than 2 below them and 1\u0304's with a letter less than 2\u0304 above them, respectively.\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n65\n\nWe now have two cases. If t1 + t2 \u2265 s, \u03b9m+1\nsimply increases the size of the\nm\nnull-configuration in D2,s (T (m) ) by 1. It follows that the reduced 1-signature of\nD2,s (T (m+1) ) is \u2212M +1 +P +1, as we wished to show. On the other hand, if t1 + t2 < s,\nafter step (2) of Algorithm 3.2.17 for \u03b9m+1\nwe have a tableau of shape (m, m\u2212r3 )/(r1 ).\nm\nIn step (3), we slide this into shape (m + 1, m + 1 \u2212 (r3 + 1))/(r1 + 1). We claim that\nthe rightmost \"uncovered\" letter in the second row of this tableau is greater than 2\nand the leftmost \"unsupported\" letter in the first row is less than 2\u0304. As observed in\nthe preceding paragraph, this implies that after refilling the empty spaces as in step\n(4) of Algorithm 3.2.17 the reduced 1-signature of our tableau is \u2212M +1 +P +1 in this\ncase as well.\nLet us first consider the leftmost \"unsupported\" letter. After step (2), our tableau\nis of the form\nar1 +1 * * * am\u2212r3 am\u2212r3 +1 * * * as\nb1 * * * br1 br1 +1 * * *\n\nbm\u2212r3\n\nand its column word is unchanged by the slide\nar1 +1 * * *\n\nam\u2212r3 am\u2212r3 +1 * * * as\n\n,\n\nb1 * * * br1 br1 +1 * * * bm\u2212r3\nso we have am\u2212r3 < bm\u2212r3 \u2264 2\u0304.\nThe second row of this tableau has m\u2212r3 boxes just as it did before sliding, so the\nboxes in the bottom row will never be moved. It follows that this sliding procedure\n\u0393\n\nonly changes L-shaped subtableaux into\n\n-shapes i.e.,\n\ninto\n\n\u0001\n\nand\n\nL\n\nnever involves any \u0393- or -shapes. According to the Lecouvey D-equivalence relations\nfrom section 2.2.3, such moves can only be made when the letters in the bottom row\nare strictly greater than 2. Specifically, in relations (3) and (4), the letter which is\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n66\n\n\"uncovered\" is either n or n\u0304, while in relations (1) and (2) only the second case of\neach relation applies. This proves our claim, and thus the first half of the proposition.\nSince e0 = \u03c3 \u25e6 e1 \u25e6 \u03c3, we can derive the statements about \u03b50 and \u03c60 from the\ncorresponding statements about \u03b51 and \u03c61 . More precisely, \u03b50 (T ) = \u03b51 (\u03c3(T )) and\n\u03c60 (T ) = \u03c61 (\u03c3(T )) and by (3.2.3) we have\n\u03c3(T (m) ) = \u03b9s+l\u2212m\n\u25e6 \u03b9m\nm\nk (T )\n\n\u0001\u2217BC\n\n= \u03b9s+l\u2212m\n(T \u2217BC ).\nk\n\nHence\n\n\u03b50 (T (m+1) ) = \u03b51 (\u03c3(T (m+1) )) = \u03b51 (\u03b9ks+l\u2212m\u22121 (T \u2217BC ))\n= \u03b51 (\u03b9s+l\u2212m\n(T \u2217BC )) \u2212 1 = \u03b51 (\u03c3(T (m) )) \u2212 1 = \u03b50 (T (m) ) \u2212 1.\nk\nA similar computation can be carried out for \u03c60 .\nCorollary 3.3.3.

Thus Proposition 3.3.2 implies that T\u03bb\u2032 \u2208 B\u0303min\n\u2229 B(s\u2032 \u031f2 ) \\ \u03b9ss\u2032 \u22121 (B((s\u2032 \u2212 1)\u031f2 ))\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nas a subset of B\u0303 2,s . Recall the embedding \u03a5ss\u2032 : B\u0303 2,s \u0592\u2192 B\u0303 2,s from Definition 3.2.13.\nSince s\u2032 is the minimal m for which \u03b9m\ns\u2032 (T\u03bb\u2032 ) 6= 0, Lemma 3.3.5 and its proof tell us that\n\u03b50 (F2,s (T\u03bb\u2032 )) = s \u2212 s\u2032 , where the fill map F2,s inserts an a-configuration to increase the\n\u2032\n\nwidth of T\u03bb\u2032 to s. By the same proposition the desired tableau is T\u03bb = \u03b9ss\u2032 +k1 \u25e6F2,s (T\u03bb\u2032 ).\nWe denote by Mmin(s) the set of tableaux constructed by this procedure.\n\n3.3.5\n\nInjectivity\n\nIn this subsection we show that the tableaux in Mmin (s) are all the minimal tableaux\nin B\u0303 2,s .\nWe first introduce some useful notation. Observe that any tableau T can be\nwritten as T = T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 , where the block Ti has width wi , and all letters in T1\n(resp. T5 ) are unbarred or n\u0304 in the second row (resp. barred or n in the first row), all\ncolumns in T2 (resp. T4 ) are of the form\nand all columns in T3 are of the form\n\na\nb\u0304\na\n\u0101\n\nwhere a < b \u2264 n \u2212 1 (resp. b < a \u2264 n \u2212 1),\nfor some a. Note that for a tableau in\n\nB(s\u031f2 ) \u2282 B\u0303 2,s we have 0 \u2264 w3 \u2264 1. Also note that T2 and T4 do not contain any n's\nor n\u0304's.\n2,s\nTheorem 3.3.6. We have Mmin (s) = B\u0303min\n.\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n69\n\nProof. Our proof is by induction on s. For the base case, we have explicitly verified\nby exhaustion that the statement of the theorem is true for s = 0, 1, 2.\n2,s\u22121\nBy our induction hypothesis, Mmin(s \u2212 1) = B\u0303min\n. By Lemma 3.3.5, \u03a5ss\u22121\n2,s\u22121\nincreases the level of a tableau by 1, and therefore \u03a5ss\u22121 (B\u0303min\n) = (B\u0303 2,s \\ B(s\u031f2 ))min .\n\nBy Corollaries 3.3.3 and 3.3.4, \u03b9ss\u22121 does not change the level of a tableau, so it suffices\nto show that\n2,s\nM(s) = B\u0303min\n\u2229 (B(s\u031f2 ) \\ \u03b9ss\u22121 (B((s \u2212 1)\u031f2 ))).\n\n(3.3.1)\n\nBy Lemmas 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 below, if T is a minimal tableau not in the image of \u03b9ss\u22121 ,\nit has w2 = w4 = 0, and if w3 = 1, then T3 =\n\nn\nn\u0304\n\nor T3 =\n\nn\u0304\n.\nn\n\nBy Lemma 3.3.10,\n\nequation (3.3.1) follows.\nThe following lemmas are used in the proof of Theorem 3.3.6. The proofs of these\nlemmas rely on induction on s, as did the proof of Theorem 3.3.6. The base cases\ns = 0, 1, 2 have been checked explicitly.\nLemma 3.3.7. For all t \u2208 B\u0303 2,s we have hc, \u03b5(t)i \u2265 s and hc, \u03c6(t)i \u2265 s.\n2,s\u22121\nProof. By the induction hypothesis, B\u0303min\n= Mmin(s \u2212 1).\n\nObserve that by Corollaries 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 \u03b9ji is level preserving, and by Lemma\n3.3.5, the map \u03a5ss\u22121 increases the level of a tableau by one. Our induction hypothesis\ntherefore allows us to assume that t \u2208 B(s\u031f2 ) \\ \u03b9ss\u22121(B((s \u2212 1)\u031f2 )). Combinatorially,\nwe may characterize such tableaux as being those which are legal in the classical sense\nand for which removing all 1's, 1\u0304's, and null configurations produces a tableau which is\nLecouvey D-equivalent to a tableau whose first row has width s. This characterization\nfollows from the combinatorial description of \u03b9ss\u22121 in Algorithm 3.2.17.\nWe may further restrict our attention by the observation that if T is minimal,\nthen so is T \u2217 . We may therefore assume that the stratum of the branching component\nvertex of T is non-negative. In particular, this means that T has no more 1\u0304's than\n1's.\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n70\n\nOur approach is to consider the tableau T \u2032 that results from removing the leftmost\ncolumn from T . We will show that if T \u2032 is minimal, the level of T exceeds the level\nof T \u2032 by at least 2, and if T \u2032 is not minimal, the level of T is at least as great as the\nlevel of T \u2032 .\nFirst consider the case when T \u2032 is minimal. Since T is assumed to be such that\nremoving all 1's and 1\u0304's produces a tableau which is Lecouvey D-equivalent to a\ntableau whose first row has width s, it is the case that removing all 1's and 1\u0304's from\nT \u2032 produces a tableau which is Lecouvey D-equivalent to a tableau whose first row\nhas width s \u2212 1. The minimal tableaux of B\u0303 2,s\u22121 with this property are precisely\nM(s \u2212 1). By properties of M(s \u2212 1), we know that \u03c60 (T \u2032 ) = 0, so \u03c60 (T ) \u2265 \u03c60 (T \u2032 ).\nSince our base case is s = 2, we know that the first column of T is ab , where a and b are\nboth unbarred. Observe that \u03c6(T ) = \u03c6(T \u2032) + 2\u039bb + non-negative weight if b 6= n \u2212 1\nor \u03c6(T ) = \u03c6(T \u2032) + \u039bn\u22121 + \u039bn + non-negative weight if b = n \u2212 1. Hence, the level is\nincreased by at least 2.\nNow suppose T \u2032 is not minimal. The level of the i-signatures (that is to say, the\nlevel of the sum of the weights \u03c6i (T \u2032 ) which depend on i-signatures) cannot have a\nnet decrease for i = 1, . . . , n, but there is now a possibility that \u03c60 (T ) < \u03c60 (T \u2032 ). We\nwill show that when \u03c60 (T ) < \u03c60 (T \u2032 ), the level of the i-signatures goes up by at least\n\u03c60 (T \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c60 (T ).\nFirst, suppose T has no 1's. Then by one of our hypotheses, it also has no 1\u0304's,\nand is therefore fixed by \u03c3: it follows that \u03c60 (T ) = \u03c61 (T ), so we may assume the\nupper-left entry of T to be 1.\nWe know that \u03c60 (T ) is equal to the number of \u2212's in the reduced 1-signature of\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n71\n\n\u03c3(T ).

The number of 1's is the same, so the only way this\ncontribution could be decreased is by having more 2's in the first m2 letters of the\nbottom row of \u03c3(T ). This can only come about by having b = 2, and only one \u2212 may\nbe removed in this way.\nThe other possibility is for the number of \u2212's contributed by 2\u0304's to be decreased.\nThe only Lecouvey relation which removes a 2\u0304 assumes the presence of a column 22\u0304 ,\nwhich we disallow, as it is necessarily part of a null-configuration. To decrease this\ncontribution therefore requires an additional + in the 1-signature of \u03c3(T ) compared\nto that of \u03c3(T \u2032 ), which will bracket one of the \u2212's from a 2\u0304. The additional + may\ncome from one of the additional 1\u0304's, or from a 2 that is \"pushed out\" from under the\n1's at the beginning in the case b = 2. Note that this second possibility is mutually\nexclusive with having more 2's bracketing 1's at the beginning.\nIn any case, we see that \u03c60 (T ) \u2212 \u03c60 (T \u2032 ) \u2264 2, and that when this value is 2, the\nfirst column of T is 12 . This column adds no +'s to the i-signatures, but does provide\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n72\n\na new \u2212 in the 2-signature. Since \u039b2 is a level 2 weight, the level stays the same in\nthis case.\nIf \u03c60 (T ) \u2212 \u03c60 (T \u2032 ) = 1 and the first column of T is 12 , we in fact have a net increase\nin level. If b 6= 2, the i-signature levels go up by at least 1, so still the total level\ncannot decrease.\n\nLemma 3.3.8. If T \u2208 (B\u0303 2,s \u2229 B(s\u031f2 ))min , we have w1 + w2 = w4 + w5 = \u230as/2\u230b with\nw1 , w2 , w4 and w5 as defined in the beginning of this subsection.\nProof. We first establish that hc, \u03c6(T )i \u2265 2w1 + 2w2 + w3 , and thus by \u2217-duality,\nhc, \u03b5(T )i \u2265 w3 + 2w4 + 2w5 as well. Recall that 0 \u2264 w3 \u2264 1.\nFirst, observe that every letter in the bottom row of T1 contributes:\n\u2022 a \u2212 to the reduced a-signature if 2 \u2264 a \u2264 n \u2212 2 is in the bottom row;\n\u2022 a \u2212 to both the (n \u2212 1)-signature and the n-signature if n \u2212 1 is in the bottom\nrow;\n\u2022 a \u2212 to the n-signature (resp. (n \u2212 1)-signature) if n (resp. n\u0304) is the bottom\nrow.\nSuppose T1 has a column of the form\n\na\nb\n\nwith b 6= a+1, or b = n\u0304 and a 6= n\u22121. For the\n\n\u2212 in the a-signature of T contributed by this a to be bracketed, we must have a column\nof the form\n\na\u2032\na+1\n\nto the left of this column in T1 , with a\u2032 < a. Applying this observation\n\nrecursively, we see that to bracket as many \u2212's as possible we must eventually have\na column of the form\nn\u22121\nn\n\n(resp.\n\nn\u22121\n)\nn\u0304\n\n1\nc\n\nfor some c 6= 2. Note that in the case of columns of the form\n\nthe \u2212 in the n-signature (resp. (n \u2212 1)-signature) from n \u2212 1 that is\n\nnot bracketed by the + from the n (resp. n\u0304) below it cannot be bracketed, since n\nand n\u0304 may not appear in the same row.\nNow, consider a column\n\na\nb\u0304\n\nin T2 , so we have a < b, and thus also \u0101 > b\u0304. Recall\n\nthat T2 has no n's or n\u0304's, so b \u2264 n\u22121. This column contributes \u2212's to the a-signature\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n73\n\nand the (b \u2212 1)-signature of T . In this case, these \u2212's may be bracketed. Due to the\nconditions that the rows and columns of T are increasing, the \u2212 from the a can only\nbe bracketed by an a + 1 in the bottom row of T1 and the \u2212 from the b\u0304 can only\nbe bracketed by a b in the bottom row of T1 . Furthermore, the letter above these\nmust be strictly less than a and b \u2212 1, respectively. By the reasoning in the previous\nparagraph, we see that to bracket every \u2212 engendered by the column\ntwo columns of the form\n\n1\n,\na\u2032\n\na\nb\u0304\n\nwe must have\n\nwith each a\u2032 6= 2.\n\nIf w3 = 1, T has a column of the form a\u0101 . We have two cases; 2 \u2264 a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and\na = n (resp. a = n\u0304). In the first case, we have a \u2212 in the (a \u2212 1)-signature from the \u0101\nin this column. Because of the prohibition against configurations of the form\n\naa\n,\n\u0101\n\nthis\n\n\u2212 can only be bracketed by a + from an a in the bottom row of T1 . Therefore, this\ncolumn engenders another column of the form\n\n1\n.\na\u2032\n\nIn the case of a = n (resp. a = n\u0304),\n\nwe have a \u2212 in the (n \u2212 1)-signature (resp. n-signature) which cannot be bracketed.\nTo bracket the maximal number of \u2212's (i.e., to minimize hc, \u03c6(T )i) we see that\nunless T3 =\n\nn\nn\u0304\n\nor T3 = n\u0304n , we must have\n\nT1 T2 T3 =\n\naw +w +w\naw aw +1\na2w2 +w3 +1\n1\n1\n*** 1 1 *** 1 2 3,\n***\nb\u0304\nbw1 b\u0304w1 +1\nb\nb\nb\n{z2w2 +w3} | 2w2 +w3 +1\n{z\n}|\n{zw1 +w2 +w3}\n|1\n2w2 +w3\n\nw1 \u2212(2w2 +w3 )\n\n(3.3.2)\n\nw2 +w3\n\nwhere each column in the first block contributes 3 to hc, \u03c6(T )i, each column in the\nsecond block contributes 2 to hc, \u03c6(T )i, and the third block contributes nothing. In\nthe case T3 =\n\nn\nn\u0304\n\nor T3 = n\u0304n , we have w2 = 0, so we simply have T1 T2 T3 = T1 T3 , where\n\neach column in T1 increases hc, \u03c6(T )i by at least 2 and T3 increases hc, \u03c6(T )i by 1.\nWe therefore have in the first case hc, \u03c6(T )i \u2265 3(2w2 + w3 ) + 2(w1 \u2212 2w2 \u2212 w3 ) =\n2w1 + 2w2 + w3 , and in the second case hc, \u03c6(T )i \u2265 2w1 + w3 = 2w1 + 2w2 + w3 , as\nwe wished to show.\nSince by Lemma 3.3.7 elements in B\u0303 2,s have level at least s, it follows that when\nT \u2208 (B\u0303 2,s \u2229 B(s\u031f2 ))min , we have w1 + w2 \u2264 \u230as/2\u230b, and by \u2217-duality that w4 + w5 \u2264\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n74\n\n\u230as/2\u230b. Furthermore, since s = w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5 , it follows that w1 + w2 =\nw4 + w5 = \u230a 2s \u230b and w3 = 0 if s is even and w3 = 1 if s is odd.\nLemma 3.3.9. Suppose T \u2208 (B\u0303 2,s \u2229 B(s\u031f2 ))min has both an unbarred letter and a\nbarred letter in a single column\n\na\nb\u0304\n\nother than nn\u0304 , n\u0304n ,\n\nn\u22121\n,\nn\u0304\n\nor\n\nn\n.\nn\u22121\n\nThen T \u2208 \u03b9ss\u22121 (B((s\u2212\n\n1)\u031f2 ).\nProof. By using the reverse of Algorithm 3.2.17, it suffices to show the following:\n1. T has a 1;\n2. T has a 1\u0304;\n3. after removing all 1's and 1\u0304's, applying the Lecouvey D relations will reduce\nthe width of T .\nThe proof of Lemma 3.3.8 shows that if w2 6= 0, or w3 = 1 and T3 6= nn\u0304 , n\u0304n , then T\nhas a 1. By \u2217-duality, if w4 6= 0, or the same condition is placed on w3 and T3 , then\nT has a 1\u0304. We will show that if w2 + w3 6= 0, then w3 + w4 6= 0, which will prove\nstatements (1) and (2) above.\nIf w3 = 1 this statement is trivial, so we assume w3 = 0. We show that the\nassumptions w2 6= 0 and w4 = 0 lead to a contradiction. From the proof of Lemma\n3.3.8, we know that for T to be minimal, every \u2212 from T5 must be bracketed. Because\nof the increasing conditions on the rows and columns of T , the \u2212's from the bottom\nrow of T5 cannot be bracketed by +'s from T5 , so there must be at least w5 +'s\nfrom T1 T2 . Inspection of (3.3.2) shows us that the first block contributes no +'s, the\nsecond block contributes w1 \u2212 2w2 many +'s, and the third block contributes 2w2\nmany +'s. We thus have w1 \u2265 w5 ; but Lemma 3.3.8 tells us that w1 + w2 = w4 + w5 ,\ncontradicting our assumption that w2 6= 0 and w4 = 0.\nFor the proof of statement (3), we must show that every configuration\n\nc\nab\n\nin T\n\navoids the following patterns (recall the Lecouvey D sliding algorithm from section\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n2.2.3):\n\nn\nx n\u0304\n\nand\n\nn\u0304\nxn\n\nwith x \u2264 n \u2212 1;\n\n75\nn\u0304\nn\u22121 n\u22121\n\n;\n\nn\nn\u22121 n\u22121\n\n; and c \u2265 a, unless c = a = b\u0304. If\n\nT has any of these patterns, the top row will not slide over.\nFirst, simply observe that the first four specified configurations exclude the possibility of having a column of the form\n\na\nb\u0304\n\nother than\n\nn\nn\u0304\n\nor n\u0304n . It therefore suffices to\n\nshow that the presence of a column d\u0113 , 2 \u2264 d, e \u2264 n \u2212 1 implies that T avoids c \u2265 a,\nunless c = a = b\u0304. We break our analysis of this criterion into several special cases:\nCase 1: a and b are barred, c is unbarred: trivial.\nCase 2: a is unbarred, b and c are barred: This excludes the possibility of having\nd\n\u0113\n\n\u2208 T.\nCase 3: a and c are unbarred, b is barred: We know the \u2212 in the c-signature\n\nfrom c must be bracketed; if it is by b, we have b = c\u0304. As we saw in the proof of\nLemma 3.3.8, we must have the \u2212 in the (c \u2212 1)-signature from c\u0304 bracketed by a c in\nthe bottom row. This forces a \u2265 c. If the \u2212 in the c-signature from c is bracketed by\na c + 1, it also must be in the bottom row, forcing a > c.\nCase 4: a, b, c all unbarred: Suppose c \u2265 a. Let d be the leftmost unbarred\nletter weakly to the right of c which does not have its \u2212 bracketed by the letter\nimmediately below it. (Such a letter exists, since we assume the occurence of\n\nd\n\u0113\n\n\u2208 T,\n\nexcept when d = e; this case will be treated below.) This letter d must be bracketed\nby a d + 1 in the bottom row, and it must be weakly to the left of a. But we have\nd + 1 > d \u2265 c \u2265 a \u2265 d + 1; contradiction.\nIf instead we have a\n\nd\nd \u0304\n\ncolumn, we must have the \u2212 from the d \u0304 bracketed by a d\n\nin the bottom row weakly to the left of a.

B\u0303 2,s is the only affine finite-dimensional crystal satisfying the\nproperties of Conjecture 2.2.5.\nFor the proof of Proposition 3.3.11 we must show that our definition of \u03c3 is the\nonly crystal automorphism satisfying the properties of Conjecture 2.2.5. Recall from\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n77\n\nthe beginning of section 2.4 the relationship between \u03c3 and \u03c3\u030c. Let T \u2208 B\u0303 2,s . We\nknow that\n\nwt(T ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nki \u039bi \u21d4 wt(\u03c3(T )) = k1 \u039b0 + k0 \u039b1 +\n\ni=0\n\nn\nX\n\nki \u039bi .\n\n(3.3.3)\n\ni=2\n\nPlease note that in this section we often use the phrase \"the tableau b is in the\nbranching component vertex v\" to mean b \u2208 B(v).\nLemma 3.3.12. Let v \u2208 BC(k\u031f2 ) be a branching component vertex in stratum 0 associated with a rectangular partition, and let l be minimal such that v \u2208 \u03b9\u030ckl (BC(l\u031f2 )).\nThen the hypothesis that B\u0303 2,s is perfect of level s can only be satisfied if \u03c3\u030c(v) is the\nvertex associated with the same shape as v in stratum 0 in BC((s + l \u2212 k)\u031f2 ).\nProof. We have already shown that \u03c3\u030c(v) has the same shape as v and is in stratum\n0, so it only remains to show that \u03c3\u030c(v) \u2208 BC((s + l \u2212 k)\u031f2 ).\nFirst, observe that v must contain a minimal tableau as constructed in section\n3.3.4, according to the following table.\nshape associated with v\n\nweight of tableau in v\n\n(2m)\n\nm\u039b2 + (k \u2212 2m)\u039b1 + (s \u2212 k)\u039b0\n\n(m, m)\n\nm\u039b3 + (k \u2212 2m)\u039b1 + (s \u2212 k)\u039b0\n\nRecall from 2.4 that cw(b) = wt(b) \u2212 (\u03c60 (b) \u2212 \u03b50 (b))\u039b0 . Let T be the tableau constructed by this prescription, so that hc, cw(T )i = k. The criterion that hc, \u03c6(T )i \u2265 s\nforces us to have \u03c60 (T ) = \u03c61 (\u03c3(T )) \u2265 s \u2212 k. We denote T (i) = \u03b9ik (T ), and thus have\n\u03c61 (T (i) ) = i \u2212 l.\nWe show inductively that \u03c3(T (i) ) = T (s+l\u2212i) for l \u2264 i \u2264 s. As a base case, we see\nthat hc, cw(T (l) )i = l, so we must have \u03c61 (\u03c3(T (l) )) \u2265 s \u2212 l. The only T (i) for which\nthis inequality holds is T (s) , where we have \u03c61 (T (s) ) = s \u2212 l.\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n78\n\nFor the induction step, assume that \u03c3 sends T (l) , T (l+1) , . . . , T (k\u22121) to\nT (s) , . . . , T (s+l\u2212k+1) , respectively. By the above inequality this implies \u03c61 (\u03c3(T (k) )) \u2265\ns \u2212 k, which specifies that \u03c3(T (k) ) = T (s+l\u2212k).\nDefinition 3.3.13. Recall the map \u03a5ss\u2032 from Definition 3.2.13. We define \u03a5\u030css\u2032 :\n\u2032\n\nBC(B\u0303 2,s ) \u0592\u2192 BC(B\u0303 2,s ) by \u03a5\u030css\u2032 (v) = v \u2032 if for some T \u2208 B(v), we have \u03a5ss\u2032 (T ) \u2208 B(v \u2032 ).\nLemma 3.3.14. Let v \u2208 BC(k\u031f2 ) be a branching component vertex in stratum p\nwith 1 \u2264 p \u2264 s \u2212 1 associated to the shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ). Suppose that for the branching\ncomponent vertex w \u2208 BC(k\u031f2 ) in stratum p \u2212 1 with shape (\u03bb1 \u2212 1, \u03bb2 ), B\u0303 2,s has the\ncorrect energy function and is perfect only if \u03c3\u030c(w) is as described in section 3.1.5.\nThen B\u0303 2,s has the correct energy function only if \u03c3\u030c(v) is as described in section 3.1.5.\nProof. First, recall that the partitions associated to vertices in stratum p in BC(B\u0303 2,s )\nare produced by adding or removing one box from the partitions associated to vertices\nof stratum p + 1. Since the vertex in stratum s is associated with a rectangle of shape\n(s), the only stratum for which we can have a two-row rectangle is stratum 0. It\nfollows that removing a box from the first row of v results in a partition apppearing\nin stratum p \u2212 1, so there is in fact a vertex w as described in the statement of the\nlemma.\nLet l be minimal such that v \u2208 \u03b9\u030ckl (BC(l\u031f2 )). We may assume v \u2208\n/ BC(l\u031f2 ),\nand let \u03c3\u030c(v) be determined by the involutive property of \u03c3\u030c in the case v \u2208 BC(l\u031f2 ).\nSpecifically, we will show that the vertex v \u2032 \u2208 BC(s\u031f2 ) with the same shape and\nstratum as v has the property that \u03c3\u030c(v \u2032 ) is the complementary vertex of v, and\ntherefore \u03c3\u030c(v) is the complementary vertex of v \u2032 . (Recall the notion of complementary\nvertex from page 33.)\nThe top row of w is one box shorter than the top row of v, so that w \u2208 \u03b9\u030ckl\u22121 (BC((l\u2212\n1)\u031f2 )), and l \u2212 1 is minimal with this property. By our hypothesis, \u03c3\u030c(w) is the vertex\nwith shape (\u03bb1 \u2212 1, \u03bb2 ) of stratum \u2212p + 1 in BC((s + (l \u2212 1) \u2212 k)\u031f2 ).\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n79\n\nWe now use induction on s. Suppose that the only choice of \u03c3\u030c for which B\u0303 2,s\u22121 is\nperfect and has an energy function is that of section 3.1.5. Part 3 of Conjecture 2.2.5\nstates that in B\u0303 2,s , the energy on the component B((s \u2212 k)\u031f2 ) is \u2212k, and so the\ndifference in energy between B((s \u2212 k)\u031f2 ) and B((s \u2212 j)\u031f2 ) is j \u2212 k. In order for this\nto be true for all 1 \u2264 k, j \u2264 s \u2212 1, the action of f0 and e0 on B\u0303 2,s must agree with the\naction on B\u0303 2,s\u22121 . More precisely, if v and w are in different classical components of\nB\u0303 2,s\u22121 and f0 (v) = w in B\u0303 2,s\u22121 , then f0 (\u03a5ss\u22121 (v)) = \u03a5ss\u22121 (w); this statement extends\nnaturally to BC(B\u0303 2,s\u22121 ) and BC(B\u0303 2,s ).\nLet v \u2020 denote the vertex with shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) in stratum \u2212p in BC((s + l \u2212 k)\u031f2 ).\nSince we assumed k 6= l, we know that v \u2020 \u2208\n/ BC(s\u031f2 ), and therefore v \u2020 has a preimage\nunder \u03a5\u030css\u22121 . From our construction of \u03c3\u030c we know that in BC(B\u0303 2,s\u22121), (\u03a5\u030css\u22121 )\u22121 (v \u2020 )\nhas a 0 arrow to (\u03a5\u030css\u22121 )\u22121 (\u03c3\u030c(w)). Our induction argument tells us that in BC(B\u0303 2,s ),\nv \u2020 has a 0 arrow to \u03c3\u030c(w). Since v has a 1 arrow to w and we must have f0 = \u03c3f1 \u03c3,\nwe conclude that in fact \u03c3\u030c(v) = v \u2020 .\nLemma 3.3.15. Let v \u2208 BC(k\u031f2 ) be a branching component vertex in stratum 0\nassociated to the non-rectangular shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ), and suppose that for the branching\ncomponent vertex w \u2208 BC(k\u031f2 ) in stratum 1 with shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 + 1), B\u0303 2,s has the\ncorrect energy function and is perfect only if \u03c3\u030c(w) is as described in section 3.1.5.\nThen B\u0303 2,s has the correct energy function only if \u03c3\u030c(v) is as described in section 3.1.5.\nProof. (This proof is very similar to the proof of Lemma 3.3.14.)\nLet l be minimal such that v \u2208 \u03b9\u030ckl (BC(l\u031f2 )), assuming k 6= l. Note that l is also\nminimal for w \u2208 \u03b9\u030ckl (BC(l\u031f2 )), since the shapes for v and w have the same number of\nboxes in the first row. By our hypothesis, \u03c3\u030c(w) is the vertex with shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 + 1)\nin stratum 1 in BC((s + l \u2212 k)\u031f2). Let v \u2020 be the vertex with shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) in stratum\n0 in BC((s + l \u2212 k)\u031f2 ). From our construction of \u03c3\u030c, we know that in BC(B\u0303 2,s\u22121 ),\n(\u03a5\u030css\u22121 )\u22121 (w) has a 0 arrow to (\u03a5\u030css\u22121 )\u22121 (\u03c3\u030c(v \u2020 )). It follows from our induction argument\nthat in BC(B\u0303 2,s ), w has a 0 arrow to \u03c3\u030c(v \u2020 ). Since w has a 1 arrow to v and we must\n\n\f3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.2\n\n80\n\nhave f0 = \u03c3f1 \u03c3, we conclude that in fact \u03c3\u030c(v) = v \u2020 .\nCorollary 3.3.16. Corollary 2.4.1 and Lemmas 3.3.12, 3.3.14 and 3.3.15 determine\n\u03c3\u030c on BC(B\u0303 2,s ) uniquely.\nProof. For any vertex v associated with shape (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) in stratum p \u2265 0, \u03c3\u030c(v) is fixed\nby the image under \u03c3\u030c of a vertex with shape (\u03bb1 \u2212 s + p, \u03bb2 ) and in stratum 0 by\nLemma 3.3.14. If \u03bb1 \u2212 s + p 6= \u03bb2 , Lemmas 3.3.14 and 3.3.15 may be used together\nto reduce determining \u03c3\u030c(v) to determining the action of \u03c3\u030c on a rectangular vertex in\nstratum 0, which is given by Lemma 3.3.12.\n\n\f81\n\nChapter 4\nLocal Properties of Crystals for\nModules over Doubly Laced\nAlgebras\n4.1\n\nLocal Characterization of Simply Laced Crystals\n\nIn [46], a local charactarization of crystals for highest weight integrable representations of simply-laced algebras is given. Furthermore, Proposition 2.4.4 of [17] states\nthat a crystal with a unique maximal vertex comes from a representation if and only\nif it decomposes as a disjoint union of crystals of representations relative to the rank 2\nsubalgebras corresponding to each pair of edge colors. It therefore suffices to address\nthe problem of locally characterizing crystal graphs for rank 2 algebras. The results\nof [46] apply to the algebras A1 \u00d7 A1 and A2 ; the obvious next case to consider is\nC2 \u2243 B2 . In the sequel, a \"doubly laced algebra\" is a Kac-Moody algebra all of whose\nregular rank 2 subalgebras are A1 \u00d7 A1 , A2 , or C2 .\nWe now recall the results of [46] on the local structure of crystal graphs. While\n\n\f4.1. Local Characterization of Simply Laced Crystals\n\n82\n\nthe main theorem of [46] pertains only to simply laced algebras, several statements\nthat apply to crystals for an arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra are also proved there.\nWe begin by choosing an index set I and a Cartan matrix A = [aij ]i,j\u2208I for a\nKac-Moody algebra, and consider a directed graph X whose edges are colored by the\nelements of I. We assume that\n(P1) All monochromatic directed paths in X have finite length\n(P2) For any vertex v of X and every i \u2208 I, there is at most one i edge into v and\none i edge out of v.\nThese assumptions (the first two axioms of [46]) allow us to define the i-string through\nv to be the maximal path in X of the form\nfi\u2212d v \u2192 * * * \u2192 fi\u22121 v \u2192 v \u2192 fi v \u2192 * * * \u2192 fir v.\nThese familiar statistics d = \u03b5i (v) and r = \u03c6i (v) are here called the i-depth and i-rise\nof v, respectively.\nRemark 4.1.1. Our conventions differ from those of [46] by the sign of the i-depth and\nthe greek letters denoting these quantities. This is more consistent with the existing\nliterature on crystals.\nStembridge introduces the following local statistics for a crystal vertex v such that\n\u03b5i (v) > 0 and \u03b5j (v) > 0:\n\n\u2206i \u03b5j (v) = \u03b5j (v) \u2212 \u03b5j (ei v)\n\nand\n\n\u2206i \u03c6j (v) = \u03c6j (v) \u2212 \u03c6j (ei v),\n\nand\n\n\u2207i \u03c6j (v) = \u03c6j (v) \u2212 \u03c6j (fi v).\n\nand complementarily,\n\n\u2207i \u03b5j (v) = \u03b5j (v) \u2212 \u03b5j (fi v)\n\n\f4.1. Local Characterization of Simply Laced Crystals\n\n83\n\nHe shows that for a crystal of a module over any Kac-Moody algebra, we have the\nfollowing\n(P3) \u2206i \u03b5j (v) + \u2206i \u03c6j (v) = aij\n(P4) \u2206i \u03c6j (v) \u2264 0 and \u2206i \u03b5j (v) \u2264 0\n(P5) If \u2206i \u03b5j (v) = 0, then ei ej v = ej ei v and \u2207j \u03c6i (ei ej v) = 0\n(P6) If \u2206i \u03b5j (v) = \u2206j \u03b5i (v) = \u22121, then ei e2j ei v = ej e2i ej v, and \u2207i \u03c6j (ei e2j ei v) =\n\u2207i \u03c6j (ei e2j ei v) = \u22121.\n(P5') If \u2207i \u03b5j (v) = 0, then ei ej v = ej ei v and \u2206j \u03c6i (ei ej v) = 0\n(P6') If \u2207i \u03b5j (v) = \u2207j \u03b5i (v) = \u22121, then ei e2j ei v = ej e2i ej v, and \u2206i \u03c6j (ei e2j ei v) =\n\u2206i \u03c6j (ei e2j ei v) = \u22121.\nStembridge proved that these axioms hold for all crystals of highest weight modules\nof Kac-Moody algebras, and that they precisely characterize those over simply laced\nalgebras. In the work that follows, we show that when generalizing to doubly laced\nalgebras, there are only two other possible local behaviors,\nei ej ei ej ei v = ej e3i ej v\n\nand\n\nei e2j e3i ej v = ej e3i e2j ei v.\n\nNote that Theorem 1.2.4 does not provide a local characterization of crystals\ncoming from representations of doubly laced algebras. In order to have such a characterization, it would be necessary to provide additional axioms to those stated above\nand to show that any graph satisfying those axioms is in fact a crystal. Here, we only\nshow the other half of the characterization; we are assured that any graph with a\nrelation not explicitly described in the above theorem is in fact not a crystal over one\nof these algebras.\n\n\f4.2. Realization of Crystals for Modules over Type C2 Algebras\n\n84\n\nAnother application of the results of [46] appears in [6], which gives a novel construction of A2 -crystals based on half-grids. Results such as those in [46] and [6], as\nwell as those discussed below, impart an increased understanding of the graph/poset\ntheoretic aspects of crystal graphs, revealing a new perspective on the representation\ntheory of Lie algebras.\n\n4.2\n\nRealization of Crystals for Modules over Type\nC2 Algebras\n\nRecall that a crystal is a colored directed graph in which we interpret an i-colored\nedge from the vertex x to the vertex y to mean that fi x = y and ei y = x, where\nei and fi are Kashiwara crystal operators. The vector representation of C2 has the\nfollowing crystal:\n\n1\n\n1\n-\n\n2\n\n2\n-\n\n1\n\n2\u0304\n\n-\n\n1\u0304\n\nWe realize crystals using tableaux filled with the letters {1, 2, 2\u0304, 1\u0304} with the total\nordering 1 < 2 < 2\u0304 < 1\u0304. The following definition is adapted from that in [24].\nDefinition 4.2.1. A C2 Young diagram is a partition with no more than two parts;\nwe draw it as a left-justified two-row arrangement of boxes such that the second row\nis no longer than the first.\nA C2 tableau is a filling of a C2 Young diagram by the letters of the above alphabet\nwith the following properties:\n1. each row is weakly increasing by the ordering in the vector representation;\n2. each column is strictly increasing by the ordering in the vector representation;\n3. no column may contain 1 and 1\u0304 simultaneously;\n\n\f4.2.

The relevant +'s in the signatures of a generic tableau\nnaturally fall into two groups as described by definition 4.3.1.\nDefinition 4.3.1. Let T be a C2 tableau.\n\u2022 We define the left block of +'s in the 1-signature of T to be those +'s from 2's\nin the top row and 1\u0304's in the bottom row. If no such entries appear in T , we\nsay that the left block of +'s in the 1-signature of T has size 0 and its left edge\nis located on the immediate left of symbol coming from the leftmost 2\u0304 or 1\u0304 in\nthe top row of T . If there is furthermore no such entry, its left edge is located\nat the right end of the 1-signature of T .\n\u2022 We define the right block of +'s in the 1-signature of T to be those +'s from 1\u0304\nin the top row of T . If no such entry appears in T , we say that the right block\nof +'s in the 1-signature of T has size 0 and its left edge is located at the right\nend of the 1-signature of T .\n\u2022 We define the left block of +'s in the 2-signature of T to be those +'s from 2\u0304\nin the bottom row. If such an entry does not appear in T , we say that the left\nblock of +'s in the 2-signature of T has size 0 and its left edge is located on\nthe immediate left of the \u2217 in the 2-signature coming from the leftmost 1\u0304 in the\n\n\f4.3. Analysis of Generic C2 tableaux\n\n89\n\nbottom row of T . If T has no 1\u0304's in the bottom row, we say that its left edge\nis located at the right end of the 2-signature of T .\n\u2022 We define the right block of +'s in the 2-signature of T to be those +'s from\n2\u0304 in the top row of T . If such an entry does not appear in T , we say that the\nright block of +'s in the 2-signature of T has size 0 and its left edge is located\non the immediate left of the \u2217 in the 2-signature coming from the leftmost 1\u0304 in\nthe top row of T . If there are furthermore no 1\u0304's in the top row of T , we say\nthat its left edge is located at the right end of the 2-signature of T .\nIn the above cases when a block of +'s has positive size we say that its left edge\nis on the immediate left of its leftmost +.\nMotivated by this definition, we define the following statistics on a C2 tableaux\nT.\n\u2022 A(T ) is the number of 2\u0304's in the top row of T ,\n\u2022 B(T ) is the number of 2's in the top row of T plus the number of 1\u0304's in the\nbottom row of T ,\n\u2022 C(T ) is the number of 2's in the top row of T ,\n\u2022 D(T ) is the number of 2\u0304's in the bottom row of T .\nExample 4.3.2.

By\nconstrast, in T2 we have A = 2 = B, so e1 will act on the right block of +'s in the\n1-signature; this corresponds to the 1\u0304 in the top row.\nLet\nT3 =\n\n1 1 2 2\u0304 2\u0304 1\u0304\n2\u0304 2\u0304 1\u0304\n\nand\nT4 =\n\n1 2 2 2\u0304 2\u0304 1\u0304\n\n.\n\n2\u0304 2\u0304 1\u0304\nIn the case of T3 , we have C = 1 < 2 = D, so e2 will act on the left block of +'s in\nthe 2-signature; in this case, it will act on the leftmost 2\u0304 in the bottom row of T3 .\nBy contrast, in T4 we have C = 2 = D, so e2 will act on the right block of +'s in the\n2-signature; this will be the leftmost 2\u0304 in the top row.\n\n\f4.3. Analysis of Generic C2 tableaux\n\n91\n\nWe now show that the entries in T on which a sequence ei1 * * * eil acts are determined by which blocks of +'s correspond to those entries. To achieve this, we verify\nthat the left edge of a block of +'s can be changed only by acting on that block of\n+'s. This goal motivates the following notation.\nWe write el1 to indicate the Kashiwara operator e1 when applied to a tableau T\nsuch that A(T ) < B(T ) and er1 to indicate the Kashiwara operator e1 when applied to\na tableau T such that A(T ) \u2265 B(T ). Similarly, we write el2 to indicate the Kashiwara\noperator e2 when applied to a tableau T such that C(T ) < D(T ) and er2 to indicate\nthe Kashiwara operator e2 when applied to a tableau T such that C(T ) \u2265 D(T ).\nNote that these are not new operators: we simply use the superscript notation to\nrecord additional information about how the operators act on specific tableaux.\nClaim 4.3.5. Let T be a tableau such that er1 T 6= 0. Then the left edges of both the\nleft and right blocks of +'s in the 2-signature of e1 T and the left edge of the left block\nof +'s in the 1-signature of e1 T are in the same place as they are in the signatures of\nT , and the left edge of the right block of +'s in the 1-signature of e1 T is one position\nto the right of that in T .\nSymmetrically, if el1 T 6= 0, the left edges of the blocks in the 2-signature and the\nright block in the 1-signature are unchanged and the left edge of the left block in the\n1-signature moves one position to the right; if er2 T 6= 0, the left edges of the blocks in\nthe 1-signature and the left block in the 2-signature are unchanged and the left edge\nof the right block in the 2-signature moves one position to the right; and if el2 T 6= 0,\nthe left edges of the blocks in the 1-signature and the right block in the 2-signature are\nunchanged and the left edge of the left block in the 2-signature moves one position to\nthe right.\nProof. Let i = 1 and j = 2 or vice versa, and let x = l and y = r or vice versa. It\nis clear from the combinatorially defined action of ei on C2 tableaux that if exi T 6= 0,\nthe left edge of the y block of +'s in the i-signature of ei T is in the same place as in\n\n\f4.3. Analysis of Generic C2 tableaux\n\n92\n\nthe i-signature of T , and that the left edge of the x block of +'s in the i-signature of\nei T is one space to the right of its position in the i-signature of T . We may therefore\ndevote our attention to the j-signature in each of the four cases of concern.\nFirst, consider the case of el1 T 6= 0. By Claim 4.3.3, we know that this operator\nchanges a 2 in the top row to a 1 or a 1\u0304 in the bottom row to a 2\u0304. In the first case, no\n+'s are added to the 2-signature, and no change is made to those entries of interest\nto the location of a block of +'s of size 0 in the 2-signature. In the other case, one +\nis added to the left block of +'s in the 2-signature; this addition is to the right of the\nleft edge of this block. Finally, the right block of +'s in the 2-signature of e1 T is the\nsame as in the 2-signature of T in any case.\nNext, consider the case of er1 T 6= 0. By Claim 4.3.3, we know that this operator\nchanges a 1\u0304 in the top row of T into a 2\u0304. This adds one + to the right block of +'s\nin the 2-signature to the right of its left edge and makes no change to the left block\nof +'s.\nNow, consider the case of el2 T 6= 0. By Claim 4.3.3, we know that this operator\nchanges a 2\u0304 in the bottom row to a 2. This does not contribute a + to either the left\nor right blocks of the 1-signature of e2 T , nor does it pertain to the location of a block\nof +'s of size 0 in the 1-signature, so the left edges in this signature are the same as\nin the 1-signature of T .\nFinally, we consider the case of er2 T 6= 0. By Claim 4.3.3, we know that this\noperator changes a 2\u0304 in the top row to a 2. This has the effect of adding a + to the\nleft block of +'s in the 1-signature to the right of the left edge of this block. Finally,\nthe right block of +'s in the 1-signature of e2 T is the same as in the 1-signature of T .\n\nCorollary 4.3.6. Let T be a tableau such that el1 T 6= 0, and let E be a sequence of\noperators from the set {er1 , el2 , er2 } such that ET 6= 0. Then el1 acts on the same entry\nin T as it does in ET . The symmetric statements corresponding to the cases of Claim\n\n\f4.3. Analysis of Generic C2 tableaux\n\n93\n\n4.3.5 hold as well.\nExample 4.3.7. Let\nT =\n\n2\u0304 1\u0304\n\n,\n\n1\u0304\nso\ner1 T =\n\n2\u0304 2\u0304\n1\u0304\n\nis the result of acting on the third tensor factor in the column word of T . We find\nthat\nel2 el1 er2 T =\n\n1 1\u0304\n\n,\n\n2\u0304\nso that indeed we have\ner1 el2 el1 er2 T =\n\n1 2\u0304\n\n,\n\n2\u0304\nwhich differs from el2 el1 er2 T in the third tensor factor.\nThe following four Sublemmas state that the relative values of A(T ), B(T ), C(T ),\nand D(T ) not only determine where ei acts within a tableau, but also what the values\nof A(ei T ), B(ei T ), C(eiT ), and D(ei T ) are. This will be an invaluable tool for our\nanalysis in section 4.4.\nSublemma 4.3.8. Suppose T is a tableau such that e1 acts on the left block of +'s in\nthe 1-signature of T (i.e., such that A(T ) < B(T )). Then A(e1 T ) = A(T ), B(e1 T ) =\nB(T ) \u2212 1, and C(e1 T ) \u2212 D(e1 T ) = C(T ) \u2212 D(T ) \u2212 1.\nProof. We have two cases to consider; e1 may act by changing a 2 to a 1 in the top\nrow or a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304 in the bottom row. In both of these cases, it is easy to see that the\nnumber of 2\u0304's in the top row is unchanged and the number of 2's in the top row plus\nthe number of 1\u0304's in the bottom row is diminished by one; hence A(e1 T ) = A(T ) and\nB(e1 T ) = B(T ) \u2212 1.\n\n\f4.3. Analysis of Generic C2 tableaux\n\n94\n\nObserve that in the case of a 1\u0304 changing into a 2\u0304 in the bottom row, the content\nof the top row is unchanged, but the number of 2\u0304's in the bottom row is increased by\n1. In the case of a 2 changing into a 1 in the top row, the bottom row is unchanged,\nbut the number of 2's in the top row is decreased by 1. In both of these cases, we\nfind that C(e1 T ) \u2212 D(e1 T ) = C(T ) \u2212 D(T ) \u2212 1.\n\nSublemma 4.3.9. Suppose T is a tableau such that e1 acts on the right block of +'s\nin the 1-signature of T (i.e., such that A(T ) \u2265 B(T )). Then A(e1 T ) = A(T ) + 1,\nB(e1 T ) = B(T ), C(e1 T ) = C(T ), and D(e1 T ) = D(T ).\nProof. Since the right block of +'s in the 1-signature comes entirely from 1\u0304's in the\ntop row of T , it follows that acting by e1 changes one of these 1\u0304's into a 2\u0304. We\nimmediately see that the number of 2\u0304's in the top row increases by 1, and that the\nnumber of 2's in the top row and 2\u0304's and 1\u0304's in the bottom row are all unchanged.\n\nSublemma 4.3.10. Suppose T is a tableau such that e2 acts on the left block of\n+'s in the 1-signature of T (i.e., such that C(T ) < D(T )). Then A(e2 T ) = A(T ),\nB(e2 T ) = B(T ), C(e2 T ) = C(T ), and D(e2 T ) = D(T ) \u2212 1.\nProof. The entry on which e2 acts is a 2\u0304 the bottom row, which will be changed into\na 2. We immediately see that the number of 2\u0304's in the bottom row decreases by 1,\nand that the number of 2's and 2\u0304's in the top row and 1\u0304's in the bottom row are all\nunchanged.\n\nSublemma 4.3.11. Suppose T is a tableau such that e2 acts on the right block of\n+'s in the 1-signature of T (i.e., such that C(T ) \u2265 D(T )). Then A(e2 T ) = A(T ) \u2212 1,\nB(e2 T ) = B(T ) + 1, C(e2 T ) = C(T ) + 1, and D(e2 T ) = D(T ).\n\n\f4.4.

In this case e2 will change a 2\u0304 to a 2 in the top row. It is easy to see that the\nnumber of 2's in the top row increases by 1 and the number of 2\u0304's in the bottom row\nis unchanged; hence C(e2 T ) = C(T ) + 1 and D(e2 T ) = D(T ).\nLikewise, since the number of 2\u0304's in the top row is decreased by 1 and the number\nof 2's in the top row is increased by 1, we find that A(e2 T ) = A(T ) \u2212 1 and B(e2 T ) =\nB(T ) + 1.\n\n4.4\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\nWe are now equipped to address Theorem 1.2.4. It is proved as a consequence of\nLemmas 4.4.1 through 4.4.14, each of which deals with a certain case of the relative\nvalues of A(T ), B(T ), C(T ), and D(T ). To see that these cases are exhaustive, refer\nto Table 4.1.\nLemma 4.4.1. Suppose T is a tableau such that C(T ) < D(T ), e1 T 6= 0, and\ne2 T 6= 0. Then T has a degree 2 relation above it.\nProof. From Claim 4.3.3, we know that e2 acts on the left block of +'s, and by\nSublemma 4.3.10, we know that A(e2 T ) = A(T ) and B(e2 T ) = B(T ); it follows that\ne1 e2 T 6= 0, and that e1 acts on the same entry in e2 T as it does in T . Furthermore, by\nSublemmas 4.3.8 and 4.3.9, we know that either C(e1 T ) \u2212 D(e1 T ) = C(T ) \u2212 D(T ) \u2212 1\nor C(e1 T ) = C(T ) and D(e1 T ) = D(T ); in either case, we still find that C(e1 T ) <\nD(e1 T ). Since C(e1 T ) \u2265 0, we are assured that D(e1 T ) \u2265 1, and thus e2 e1 T 6= 0.\nWe conclude that e2 acts on the same entry in e1 T as it does in T .\n\n\f4.4. Proof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\n96\n\nExample 4.4.2. In Figure 4.4.1, we have an interval of a crystal in which the bottom\ntableau T has the statistics C(T ) = 1 < 2 = D(T ), illustrating Lemma 4.4.1.\n1 1 1\u0304 1\u0304\n2 2\u0304\n2\n\n1\n\n1 1 1\u0304 1\u0304\n2\u0304 2\u0304\n\n1 2 1\u0304 1\u0304\n2 2\u0304\n1\n\n2\n1 2 1\u0304 1\u0304\n2\u0304 2\u0304\nFigure 4.4.1:\n\nLemma 4.4.3. Suppose T is a tableau such that A(T ) > B(T ) + 1, e1 T 6= 0, and\ne2 T 6= 0. Then T has a degree 2 relation above it.\nProof. From Claim 4.3.3, we know that e1 acts on the right block of +'s, and by\nSublemma 4.3.9, we know that C(e1 T ) = C(T ) and D(e1 T ) = D(T ); thus e2 e1 T 6= 0,\nand e2 acts on the same entry in e1 T as it does in T . Furthermore, by Sublemmas\n4.3.10 and 4.3.11, we know that either A(e2 T ) = A(T ) and B(e2 T ) = B(T ) or\nA(e2 T ) = A(T ) \u2212 1 and B(e2 T ) = B(T ) + 1; in either case, we find that A(e2 T ) >\nB(e2 T ) and the size of the right block of +'s in the 1-signature is not diminished.\nWe therefore conclude that e1 e2 T 6= 0 and that e1 acts on the same entry in e2 T as\nit does in T .\n\nExample 4.4.4. In Figure 4.4.2, we have an interval of a crystal in which the bottom\ntableau T has the statistics A(T ) = 2 > 1 = B(T ) + 1 illustrating Lemma 4.4.3.\nLemma 4.4.5. Suppose T is a tableau such that A(T ) < B(T ), C(T ) > D(T ),\ne1 T 6= 0, and e2 T 6= 0. Then T has a degree 2 relation above it.\n\n\f4.4. Proof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\n97\n\nProof. By Claim 4.3.3, we know that e1 acts on the left block of +'s in T and e2 acts\non the right block of +'s in T . By Sublemma 4.3.11, we know that A(e2 T ) = A(T )\u22121\nand B(e2 T ) = B(T ) + 1. It follows that A(e2 T ) < B(e2 T ), and since A(e2 T ) \u2265 0,\nthis ensures that B(e2 T ) \u2265 1, and thus e1 e2 T 6= 0. We conclude that e1 acts on the\nsame entry in e2 T as it does in T . Furthermore, by Sublemma 4.3.8, we know that\nC(e1 T ) \u2212 D(e1 T ) = C(T ) \u2212 D(T ) \u2212 1; it follows that C(e1 T ) \u2265 D(e1 T ). Since we\nalso know that the size of the right block of +'s in the 2-signature of e1 T is at least\nas large as that of T , it is the case that e2 e1 T 6= 0, and so e2 acts on the same entry\nin e1 T as it does in T .\n\nExample 4.4.6. In Figure 4.4.3, we have an interval of a crystal in which the bottom\ntableau T has the statistics A(T ) = 1 < 2 = B(T ) and C(T ) = 1 > 0 = D(T ),\nillustrating Lemma 4.4.5.\nTo prove Lemmas 4.4.8 through 4.4.14, we must not only show that the given\nsequences of operators act on the same entries, but also that no pair of homogeneous\nsequences of operators (i.e., a pair (P1 , P2 ) such that P1 and P2 have the same number\nof instances of e1 and e2 ) with shorter or equal length act on the same entries.

Table 4.2 is a legend for the figures used to prove Lemmas\n4.4.8 through 4.4.12. In the picture used to prove Lemma 4.4.14, we instead use an\nedge pointing down to indicate acting by e1 and an edge pointing up to indicate acting\nby e2 ; otherwise the legend is the same.\nTo assist in proving that the sequences in question do not kill our tableaux, we\nhave the following Sublemma.\nSublemma 4.4.7. Let E be a dashed edge from v up to w; i.e., an operator eli acts\non v to produce w. Then ei v 6= 0.\nProof. The Kashiwara operator ei acts on the left block of +'s of a tableau T precisely\nwhen A(T ) < B(T ) or C(T ) < D(T ) in the cases of i = 1 or i = 2, respectively. Since\nthese numbers are all non-negative integers, we conclude that B(T ) > 0 or D(T ) > 0.\nSince these statistics indicate the number of +'s in the left block of their respective\nsignatures, we are assured that there is an entry on which ei can act.\n\nThus it suffices to prove that the solid edges in the paths of concern do not produce\n0.\n2 2\n2\u0304\n2\n\n1\n2 2\n1\u0304\n\n2 2\u0304\n2\u0304\n1\n\n2\n2 2\u0304\n1\u0304\nFigure 4.4.3:\n\n\f4.4.

Suppose T is a tableau such that A(T ) = B(T ) + 1, C(T ) \u2265 D(T ),\ne1 T 6= 0, and e2 T 6= 0. Then T has a degree 4 relation above it.\nProof. We must first confirm that the sequences e1 e22 e1 and e2 e21 e2 do not produce 0\nwhen applied to T . First, observe that since e1 acts on the right block of +'s in T , it\nchanges a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304 in the top row. This adds a + to the reduced 2-signature of the\ntableaux, so we know that e22 e1 T 6= 0. By Sublemma 4.4.7, we know that e1 e22 e1 T 6= 0.\nOn the other hand, we know that e2 acts on T by changing a 2\u0304 to a 2 in the top row;\nthis means that the reduced 1-signature of e2 T has a single + in the left block and\nits right block has at least one +, as did the 1-signature of T . We conclude that\ne21 e2 T 6= 0. We know that in e1 e2 T , e1 changes a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304 in the top row; since the\n+'s in the 2-signature from this entry cannot be paired with any \u2212's, we conclude\nthat e2 e21 e2 T 6= 0.\n\n\f4.4. Proof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\n100\n\nNow that we know that neither of these sequences produces 0 when applied to T ,\nit is clear that we have e1 e22 e1 T = e2 e21 e2 T , as the paths P1 and P2 leading from the\nbase of the graph in Figure 4.4.4 to the indicated leaves both have one solid right edge,\none dashed right edge, and two solid left edges. We must now confirm that among all\npairs (Q1 , Q2 ) of increasing paths from the base in these graphs such that Q1 begins\nby following the left edge and Q2 begins by following the right edge, (P1 , P2 ) is the\nonly pair with the same number of each type of edge.\nSince the right edge from the base of the graph is solid, our candidate for Q1\nmust have a solid right edge. Inspecting the graph tells us that this path must begin\nwith the path corresponding to e21 e2 . This path has a dashed left edge, and the only\ncandidate for Q2 with this feature is in fact P2 , which has two solid right edges. The\nonly way to extend e21 e2 to have the same edge content as P2 is by extending it to P1 .\n\nExample 4.4.9.

We must now confirm\nthat among all pairs (Q1 , Q2 ) of increasing paths from the base in these graphs such\nthat Q1 begins by following the left edge and Q2 begins by following the right edge,\n(P1 , P2 ) is the only pair with the same number of each type of edge.\nThis is easy to see by the following argument. Every candidate for Q2 (i.e., every\npath in the right half of the graphs in Figures 4.4.6 through 4.4.8) has at least one\ndashed left edge. The only candidate for Q1 (i.e., the only path in the left half of the\ngraphs in Figures 4.4.6 through 4.4.8) with a dashed left edge is P1 . By inspecting\nFigures 4.4.6 through 4.4.8, P2 is the only candidate for Q2 with two dashed right\nedges and one solid left edge.\n\nExample 4.4.11. In Figure 4.4.9, we have an interval of a crystal in which the\nbottom tableau T has the statistics A(T ) = 1 < 2 = B(T ) and C(T ) = 1 = D(T ),\nillustrating Lemma 4.4.10.\n\n\f4.4.

We must first confirm that the sequences e2 e31 e2 and e1 e2 e1 e2 e1 do not produce\n0 when applied to T . First, note that there is at least one + in the right block of the\nreduced 1-signature of T . Since e2 acts on the right block of +'s in the 2-signature\nof T , there are as many +'s in the right block of the 1-signature of e2 T as in that of\ne1 T . Observe that A(e2 T ) = B(e2 T ) \u2212 2, so we know that there are additionally two\n+'s in the left block of the reduced 1-signature of e2 T . This implies that e31 e2 T 6= 0.\nThe third of these applications of e1 changes a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304 in the top row; the + in the\n2-signature of e31 e2 T entry cannot be bracketed, so we know that e2 e31 e2 T 6= 0. On the\nother hand, we know that the right block of the reduced 2-signature of T has at least\none +. Since e1 changes a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304 in the top row of T , we know that e2 will change\nthis entry to a 2 so that the right block of the reduced signature of e1 T has at least\ntwo +'s that cannot be bracketed by \u2212's. The leftmost of these entries will be acted\nupon by e2 , so e2 e1 T 6= 0. Furthermore, since A(e2 e1 T ) = B(e2 e1 T )\u22121, we know that\ne1 e2 e1 T 6= 0.

Note\nthat these paths are equivalent to e21 e22 e1 T , due to the degree 2 relation above e2 e1 T ;\nwe may denote this alternative path by P2\u2032 . We must now confirm that among all\npairs (Q1 , Q2 ) of increasing paths from the base in these graphs such that Q1 begins\nby following the left edge and Q2 begins by following the right edge, (P1 , P2 ) and\n(P1 , P2\u2032 ) are the only pairs with the same number of each of the above types of edges.\nSince the right edge from the base of the graph is solid, our candidate for Q1 must\nhave a solid right edge. Observe that all paths in the left half of this graph with at\nleast one solid right edge have two dashed right edges. The only candidates for Q2\nwith two dashed edges are P2 and P2\u2032 , both of which have two dashed left edges.

Proof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\n107\n\nfollows that the 1\u0304's in the top row of T are also present in e21 e2 T , so e31 e2 T 6= 0. This\nfinal application of e1 changes a 1\u0304 to a 2\u0304. Since e2 acts on the left block of +'s in\ne31 e2 T , it leaves this 2\u0304 alone, and it can be acted on by the next application of e2 , so\ne22 e31 e2 T 6= 0. Finally, note that there is a 2\u0304 in the top row of T and e1 changes a 1\u0304 to\na 2\u0304 in the top row of T . Thus, there are at least two 2\u0304's in the top row of e1 T , and\ne22 e1 T 6= 0.\nNow that we know that neither of these sequences produces 0 when applied to T ,\nit is clear that we have e2 e21 e32 e1 T = e1 e32 e21 e2 T , since the paths corresponding to these\nsequences leading from the base of the graph in Figure 4.4.12 to the leaves marked\nby arrows have one solid down edge, three dashed down edges, two solid up edges,\nand one dashed up edge. Note that these paths are equivalent to e2 e1 e2 e1 e22 e1 T =\ne1 e22 e1 e2 e1 e2 T , due to the degree 2 relations above e22 e1 T and e1 e2 T ; we denote these\nalternative paths by P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 respectively. We must now confirm that among all\npairs (Q1 , Q2 ) of increasing paths from the base in these graphs such that Q1 begins\nby following the up edge and Q2 begins by following the down edge, (P1 , P2 ), (P1 , P2\u2032 ),\n(P1\u2032 , P2 ) and (P1\u2032 , P2\u2032 ), are the only pairs with the same number of each of the above\ntypes of edges.\nWe first address pairs of paths of length no greater than 5. For a path to be a\ncandidate for Q1 , it must have at least one solid down edge. The only such paths\nare those beginning with e21 e2 T . As these paths have two dashed down edges, their\nonly possible Q2 mate is e21 e22 e1 T , but none of our Q1 candidates have the same edge\ncontent as this path.\nWe now consider paths of length 6. As in the preceding paragraph, our only\ncandidates for Q1 are those paths that contain a solid down edge and begin with\ne21 e2 T ; all such paths have exactly two dashed down edges. Up to degree 2 relations,\nthere are three candidates for Q2 : e21 e32 e1 T , e1 e2 e21 e2 e1 T , and e21 e22 e21 T . None of these\npaths contain a dashed up edge, which leaves only e51 e2 T as our only candidate for\n\n\f4.4. Proof of Theorem 1.2.4\n\n108\n\nQ1 ; this cannot be paired with any of our three potential Q2 paths.\nFinally, we restrict our attention to paths of length 7. There are six paths (again,\nup to degree 2 relations) in the top half of the graph with solid down edges: e51 e22 T\nand those paths beginning with e31 e2 T . The former has four dashed down edges, a\nfeature lacking from all paths in the bottom half of the graph. We may also exclude\nfrom our consideration e61 e2 T , as all candidates for Q2 with only one up edge have at\nmost one dashed down edge.\nThe remaining three paths that might be Q1 all have a dashed up edge; the only\nQ2 candidates with this feature are P2 and P2\u2032 . The only paths in the top half of the\ngraph with the same edge content as these are P1 and P1\u2032 .\n\nExample 4.4.15. In Figure 4.4.13, we have a crystal in which the bottom tableau\nT has the statistics A(T ) = B(T ) = 1 and C(T ) = D(T ) = 0, illustrating Lemma\n4.4.14.\n\n\f4.4.

Based on user input, the program will produce an\nimage file with the requested crystal graph. The program will automatically produce\nan .epsf file, which can be included directly in a LATEX file. Using the web interface,\nthe user can see the tableau associated to a vertex of the crystal by moving the mouse\npointer over it.\nWhen running this program locally (as opposed to via the web), the program\nproduces a list of all tableaux in the specified crystal. This can be used to carry\nout calculations on crystals, including searches for tableaux with specified properties.\nAdditionaly, Kashiwara operators may be applied to the tableaux.\nAll calculations on tableaux are carried out using python. Image files are automatically generated PostScript. The web interface uses html, javascript, and css.\n\n\f5.2. Requirements\n\n5.2\n\n111\n\nRequirements\n\nCrystalView may be run using a web interface or from source code. The web interface\ncan, in principle, be used from any browser that supports form input (any \"modern\"\nbrowser). However, some aspects of the interface will only work with a browser that\ncomplies with standard html, javascript, and css. In particular, Internet Explorer is\nknown to have issues with some dynamic aspects of the web interface. Firefox is a\nrecommended alternative.\nTo run the software from source code, the user must have Python 2.4 installed on\ntheir local machine. Other versions of Python (both older and newer) may not run\nCrystalView properly. See http://www.python.org for further information regarding\npython. Python is available free of charge for all major operating systems, and is\nincluded pre-installed on many modern computers, including almost all distributions\nof Unix/Linux.\nIf used to generate image files locally, the user is advised that for large crystals,\nthese images can get quite large. See section 5.8.\n\n5.3\n\nUser input\n\nThe user may specify the following Lie theoretic data:\n\u2022 symmetry type of the algebra being represented;\n\u2022 rank of the algebra being represented;\n\u2022 highest weight of the representation.\nAdditionally, the user may specify how the edges of the crystal graph will be\ndrawn. There are two default settings, color and grayscale, as well as an option for\ncustom settings. If the custom option is selected, the user may specify the following:\n\n\f5.4. Limitations\n\n112\n\n\u2022 red/green/blue values for each edge color on a scale from 0 to 1 (Default = 1),\n\u2022 line width on a scale from 1 to 5 (Default = 5),\n\u2022 dash pattern; none, short, long (Default = none).\nThere are numerous resources on the web and preinstalled on many computers to\nassist the user in finding red/green/blue values for their desired colors.\nThe user may also choose to have the output converted to .pdf, .jpg, .gif, and/or\n.tiff formats. These conversions are carried out by ImageMagick.\n\n5.4\n\nLimitations\n\nCurrently, only types A and B (i.e., sln and so2n+1 ) are supported. Furthermore,\nin the case of type B, only even multiples of the highest fundamental weight (corresponding to the short root) may be specified. These limitations are due to the current\nstage of the development cycle; future versions of the software will add support for\ntypes C and D and all dominant weights.\nThe rank of the algebra is currently restricted by the web interface to be no larger\nthan 5. This is an artificial limitation; any rank of algebra may be specified when\nrunning CrystalView from source.\nThe web interface only allows crystals with as many as 4,000 vertices to be calculated to prevent excessive strain on the server. Considering the resolution at which\nthese images can be viewed/printed, it is unlikely that producing crystals larger than\nthis would be useful to most users. However, this limitation is artificial; when running\nthe program on a local machine, the user is limited only by their own patience and\nhard disk space.\n\n\f5.5. How it works\n\n5.5\n\n113\n\nHow it works\n\nThe web interface for CrystalView is written in dhtml; i.e., html enhanced by javascript\nand css. The Weyl dimension formula is used to calculate the number of vertices in\nthe currently specified crystal.\nThe tableaux are produced by generating the list of all column tableaux for the\ncolumn lengths appearing in the shape specified by the dominant weight. To determine what constitutes a legal tableaux, the criteria of [11] are used. The columns\nare then compared pairwise in order of decreasing length to build the set of all legal\ntableaux. In the case of type B crystals, the \"split form\" criterion of [29] is used to\ndetermine which columns can be adjacent in a legal tableau.\nThe graph is ensured to have a reasonable number of edge crossings by ordering\nthe vertices of the graph as follows, starting from the top and going down the rows,\nand proceeding through each row from left to right. First, the tableaux are collected\ninto rows according to content. There is only one tableau in the first row (the highest\nweight tableau), so the first row is in order. Now, given that row n is in order, row\nn + 1 is put in the following order. The leftmost vertices in row n + 1 will be the\nnon-zero images of the Kashiwara operators fi on the leftmost vertex in row n, taken\nin order from f1 up through fr , where r is the rank of the algebra. The next leftmost\nvertices in row n+1 are those tableaux that result from applying fi to the next vertex\nfrom row n, excluding those that have been placed to the left already. This process\ncontinues until all vertices have been placed in their final position.\n\n5.6\n\nHow to get the software\n\nThis software can be accessed at the following url:\nhttp://www.math.ucdavis.edu/\u223csternberg/crystalview/\nThe source code is available upon request from the author.\n\n\f5.7.
