They offer track position\nresolution of about 1 \u03bcm and angular resolution around 1 milliradian.\n\nVarious present [1,2] and future neutrino [3,4] experiments have used, or plan\nto use, the excellent resolution offered by nuclear emulsion sheets to unambiguously detect the production of a tau lepton.\n\nThese experiments typically use an electronic detector for calorimetry, particle identification and moderate precision tracking. The tracking detectors are\nused to reconstruct the points where particles left the emulsions. Tracks compatible with the \"prediction\" are then searched for with microscopes, in an\narea proportional in size to the impact point prediction uncertainty. If found,\nthe tracks can be followed from emulsion sheet to emulsion sheet until the\ninteraction vertex is located, or they are lost.\n\nDuring exposure, which typically lasts for months, these emulsion sheets accumulate significant quantities of background, mainly due to cosmic muons.\nWhile most of this background is perpendicular to the beam direction, a small\nfraction can be mistakenly identified as corresponding to one of the particles\nthe experiment has reconstructed. This generally leads to a wrong estimation\nof the track finding efficiency in the emulsion sheets. A method has been developed to determine the real track finding efficiency from the effective observed\n2\n\n\fefficiency directly from the available data. The method does not involve any\nsimulation.\nIn section 2 the real and effective track finding efficiencies are defined. Then,\nin section 3, a few assumptions are made which are usually true in neutrino experiments. The method to extract the real track finding efficiency is described\nin section 4, followed by a summary of the possible sources of uncertainties in\nsection 5. Conclusions are drawn in section 6.\n\n2\n\nDefinition of Real and Effective Track Finding Efficiencies\n\nThe real track finding efficiency is defined by\n\u01ebr =\n\nNumber of times the right track is f ound\n,\nNumber of tracks searched f or\n\n(1)\n\nand the observed track finding efficiency by\n\u01ebo =\n\nNumber of times a matching track is f ound\n.\nNumber of tracks searched f or\n\n(2)\n\nIt is clear that at first sight the real track finding efficiency is unknown: the\nobserved efficiency results from a convolution of signal and background, so that\nan unfolding procedure seems to be necessary to extract the real efficiency.\n\n3\n\nAssumptions\n\nThe following assumptions are made:\n3\n\n\f\u2022 The random background can be assumed to be evenly distributed for all\nthe tracks searched for in the emulsion sheets. This assumption holds for\nemulsion sheets of uniform quality which have been exposed during the same\nperiod.\n\u2022 The real track finding efficiency can have only two results: found or not\nfound. This is true if the density of events is low enough, and if particles\nfrom one event are sufficiently separated in phase space. This condition is\nsatisfied in the experiments considered here.\n\u2022 For each track, an area of identical size (proportional to the prediction\naccuracy) is scanned. In other words, when a track candidate is found, the\nrest of the area must still be scanned for possible additional candidates.\n\u2022 The maximal number of candidates for a single track exit point prediction is\nfinite. This is an assumption on the emulsion quality and the experiment's\nability to see tracks in the emulsion.\n\nAn important consequence of the first and third assumptions is that the number of tracks that migrate from 0 candidates to n candidates due to the background is equal (within statistics) to the number of tracks that migrate from\n1 to n + 1 candidates. This relies on the even distribution of background and\nthe scanning of the entire area.\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nThe Method\n\nThe idea is simple: the real result can be only zero (not found) or one (found),\nwhile in the data the number of good candidates in a given surface can be\nmuch larger due to background.\n\nConsider the distribution of the number of candidate tracks found for tracks\nthat were searched for in an emulsion sheet. In a healthy experiment, this\ndistribution has a few entries at zero, a large peak at 1, and has a small tail\nextending to larger values.\n\nCall N \u2032 (i) the number of entries in bin i, corresponding to the number of\ntracks for which i candidates were found. And call N(i) the number of entries\nthat would be observed in each bin for the real track finding efficiency. Under\nthe second assumption N(i) = 0 for i > 1.\n\nThen let X(i \u2192 j) be the number of entries that have migrated from one\nbin to another due to the background. Here i is necessarily 0 or 1 due to the\nsecond assumption, j > 0 and j > i.\n\nSince X(0 \u2192 j) = 0 for some arbitrarily large j (last assumption),\n\nX(1 \u2192 j) = X(0 \u2192 (j \u2212 1)) = N \u2032 (j) ,\nX(1 \u2192 (j \u2212 1)) = X(0 \u2192 (j \u2212 2)) = N \u2032 (j \u2212 1) \u2212 N \u2032 (j) ,\n. . . and\nX(1 \u2192 2) = X(0 \u2192 1) = N \u2032 (2) \u2212 N \u2032 (3) + N \u2032 (4) \u2212 . . .\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\fBut, by construction,\n\nN(0) = N \u2032 (0) +\n\nX\n\nX(0 \u2192 k) ,\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nwhich, using (3), is equivalent to\n\nN(0) =\n\nj/2\nX\n\nN \u2032 (2l) .\n\n(5)\n\nl=0\n\nTherefore the real track finding efficiency is\nPj/2\n\nNtot \u2212 N(0)\nNtot \u2212 l=0 N \u2032 (2l)\n\u01ebr =\n=\n,\nNtot\nNtot\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Ntot is the total number of tracks searched for.\n\n5\n\nUncertainties\n\nThe statistical uncertainty on the contents of each bin quantifies the error on\n\nX(1 \u2192 n) = X(0 \u2192 (n \u2212 1)),\n\n(7)\n\nleading to a statistical uncertainty equal to the quadratic sum of the individual\nstatistical uncertainties of the even bins.\nSystematic uncertainties can be induced by the scanning method and individual emulsion sheet properties, so that it is recommended to treat sheets one\nby one.\n6\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion\n\nA method to extract the real track finding efficiency from the observed track\nfinding efficiency in emulsion sheets has been described in detail. It relies on\nassumptions which are not stringent and usually satisfied in any experiment\nusing these types of sheets.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author acknowledges the financial support of the Institut Interuniversitaire des Sciences Nucl\u00e9aires (Belgium).\n\nReferences\n[1]\n\nChorus Collaboration, E.
