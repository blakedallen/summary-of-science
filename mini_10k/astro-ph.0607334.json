We found that for a certain class of inhomogeneities, such models could easily explain various cosmological observations without introducing dark energy, most notably the luminosity distanceredshift relation of type IA supernovae and the position\nof the first peak in the CMB spectrum. The inhomogeneities required are of the form of a spherically symmetric underdense bubble in an otherwise flat and homogeneous Einstein-de Sitter universe, with the observer\nlocated at the center of the bubble.\nUnless the observer is positioned exactly at the center of\nthe bubble, the distribution of matter, as seen by the observer, will be anisotropic. This will affect the observed\nmicrowave background and constrain the possible location of the observer, since the CMB dipole must be in\nagreement with observations [2]. Note that in a homogeneous universe model, this dipole is attributed to the\npeculiar velocity of the observer. However, as discussed\nin [3], in an LTB model there will be an additional contribution to the dipole from the anisotropy of space-time.\nThus, the dipole seen by an off-center observer will be due\nto a combination of kinematic effects and the off-center\nlocation.\nThe anisotropy will also induce higher multipoles in the\nCMB spectrum. Moffat [4] proposes this mechanism as\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: alnes@fys.uio.no\naddress: morad@astro.uio.no\n\na possible explanation for the observed alignment of the\nCMB quadru- and octopole [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], since the direction from the observer towards the center of the bubble\nsingles out a \"special\" axis.\nIn this work we will investigate these induced anisotropies\nin the CMB to establish how far from the center the observer can be located, and whether they can offer an explanation to the alignment of the lowest multipoles. We\nfind that the observer has to be located within a sphere\nextending approximately 15 Mpc about the origin, in order for the induced dipole to remain within the observed\nrange. However, within this small volume the induced\nquadru- and octopole turn out to be insufficiently large\nto explain the alignment.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sect. II, we deduce\nthe differential equations governing the path and redshift\nof photons. We then proceed to work out expressions for\nthe induced temperature distribution and corresponding\nCMB multipoles in Sect. III. Next, in Sect. IV, we solve\nthese equations numerically to find the multipoles as a\nfunction of the position of the observer. This allows us\nto find LTB models which agree with both the observed\ndipole and observations of SNIa and the position of the\nfirst CMB peak, as described in [1]. We present two such\nmodels in this section. Finally, in Sect. V we discuss and\nsummarize our work.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE GEODESIC EQUATION IN THE LTB\nSPACE-TIME\n\ny\n\nThe spherically symmetric LTB metric is given by [10,\n11, 12]\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\n\n[R\u2032 (r, t)]2 2\ndr + R2 (r, t)d\u03a92 ,\n1 + \u03b2(r)\n\nx\u0303\u03bc\n(1)\nx\n\nwhere R(r, t) is a position-dependent scale factor, and\n\u03b2(r) is related to the curvature.\nOne of the great advantages of working in this space-time\nis that the Einstein equations can be solved exactly in\nthe matter-dominated scenario. The function R(r, t) can\nthen be written in terms of a conformal time \u03b7, defined\nby \u03b2 1/2 dt = Rd\u03b7, as\n\u03b1\n(cosh \u03b7 \u2212 1)\nR =\n2\u03b2\ns\n\"\n#\n\u03b1 + \u03b2R0\n+R0 cosh \u03b7 +\nsinh \u03b7 ,\n(2)\n\u03b2R0\np\n\u03b1\n\u03b2t =\n(sinh \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7)\n2\u03b2\ns\n\"\n#\n\u03b1 + \u03b2R0\n+R0 sinh \u03b7 +\n(cosh \u03b7 \u2212 1) , (3)\n\u03b2R0\nwhere \u03b1(r) \u2265 0 is an arbitrary function, and we have\nassumed \u03b2(r) > 0. Furthermore, we have defined R0 \u2261\nR(r, 0), with the initial time t = 0 defined as the time of\nlast scattering.\nPhotons follow trajectories determined by the geodesic\nequation,\ndx\u03b1 dx\u03bd\nd2 x\u03bc\n+ \u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\n= 0,\n(4)\n2\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\nwhere \u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd is the Christoffel symbol, and \u03bb is a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) parameter defined along\nthe path of the photons.\nDue to axial symmetry, the photon paths must be independent of the azimuth angle \u03c6, which leaves three\npossible choices for free index \u03bc.

The path of the\nphoton is shown in Fig. 1. It hits the observer at an\nangle \u03be relative to the z-axis. The spatial components of\nthe unit vector along this axis are\n\u221a\n1+\u03b2\nvi =\n(1, 0, 0) ,\n(10)\nR\u2032\nwhere the three components are in the r, \u03b8 and \u03c6 direction, respectively.\nThe spatial direction ui is given by the tangent to the\nphoton path at t0 , i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03bb\n1\ndr d\u03b8 d\u03c6\nui =\n= \u2212 (p, J/R2 , 0) ,\n,\n,\n(11)\ndt\nd\u03bb d\u03bb d\u03bb\nu\nwhere the first factor ensures normalization, gij ui uj = 1,\nand we have introduced u \u2261 dt/d\u03bb and p \u2261 dr/d\u03bb. Note\nthat we have chosen to let \u03bb decrease with time, since we\nwill start integrating the equations at t = t0 and follow\nthe photons backwards in time until recombination.\nThe angle \u03be is given by the inner product of v i and ui\n\nand finally, \u03bc = \u03b8 yields\nR\u2032 d\u03b8 dr\n\u1e58 d\u03b8 dt\nd2 \u03b8\n+2\n+2\n= 0,\n2\nd\u03bb\nR d\u03bb d\u03bb\nR d\u03bb d\u03bb\n\nui\n\n(7)\n\nR\u2032 p\ncos \u03be = gij ui v j = \u2212 \u221a\n.\n1+\u03b2 u\n\n(12)\n\n\f3\nSince the parametrization of the photon path in terms\nof the affine parameter \u03bb is arbitrary, we can choose this\nsuch that \u03bb = 0 when t = t0 and u0 = u(\u03bb = 0) = \u22121.\nUsing Eqs. (9) and (12), these conditions translate into\nthe following initial conditions\n\u221a\n1+\u03b2\np0 =\ncos \u03be ,\n(13)\nR\u2032\nJ0 = J = R sin \u03be .\n(14)\n\nThis equation determines the change in redshift measured by the observer along an infinitesimal distance d\u03bb.\nTo find the redshift as a function of \u03bb for a photon hitting the observer today, we can sum up the infinitesimal\ncontributions along the past light cone,\n\"\n#\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u1e58 2\nd ln(1 + z)\n\u22121 R \u1e58 2\n= \u2212u\np + 3J ,\n(21)\nd\u03bb\n1+\u03b2\nR\n\nFurthermore, we need to determine the redshift of the\nincoming photons as a function of the direction. The\nphotons follow a path given by r(\u03bb), t(\u03bb) and \u03b8(\u03bb). The\nredshift can be represented by the change in time separation between adjacent photons. Due to the expansion\nof the universe, this separation changes as the photons\npropagate through space. The redshift is given by the\nrelative change of the separation, i.e. z = (\u03c4r \u2212 \u03c4e )/\u03c4e ,\nwhere the subscripts r and e refer to the receiver and\nemitter positions, respectively.\n\nwith the initial condition z(\u03bb = 0) = z0 = 0.\n\nConsider two photons emitted by a source with a time\nseparation of \u03c4 . Let the equation describing the time\ncoordinate along the first geodesic be t1 (\u03bb) = t(\u03bb). The\ntime along the second geodesic is then given by t2 (\u03bb) =\nt(\u03bb) + \u03c4 (\u03bb).

Since space-time\nis no longer spherically symmetric around such an observer, we expect him to measure additional anisotropies\nin the temperature to those measured by an observer\nat the center. In this paper we concentrate on the additional anisotropies rising from the observer's location,\ni.e. we disregard any intrinsic anisotropies in the CMB\ntemperature at the last-scattering surface. Thus, we assume the temperature at the last-scattering surface to be\nisotropic. Any anisotropies measured by observers today\nare therefore due to the propagation of photons through\nan anisotropic space-time.\nThe temperature of the background radiation in a given\ndirection is determined by measuring the intensity of incident photons from this direction. Assuming the radiation\nto be black-body radiation, the intensity will be given by\na Planck spectrum with a corresponding characteristic\ntemperature. It can be shown that the radiation field\npreserves its black-body nature as it propagates freely\nthrough space under the influence of a gravitational field\n[13]. At any later time, the spectrum will still remain a\nPlanck spectrum, but with a different temperature.\nIn our specific case, the CMB temperature seen today by\nan off-center observer is given by\nT (\u03be) =\n\nT\u2217\n,\n1 + z(\u03be)\n\n(22)\n\nwhere T\u2217 is the temperature at the last-scattering surface, and \u03be is the angle defined in Fig. 1. The average\ntemperature Tb measured by the observer is then\nZ\nZ\nT\u2217 \u03c0\nsin \u03be\n1\nb\n.\n(23)\nd\u03a9 T (\u03be) =\nd\u03be\nT \u2261\n4\u03c0\n2 0\n1 + z(\u03be)\n\n\f4\n\nThe relative temperature variation measured by the observer today will then be\n\u2206T\nT (\u03be) \u2212 Tb\nz\u2217 \u2212 z(\u03be)\n.\n\u0398(\u03be) \u2261\n=\n=\nb\nb\n1 + z(\u03be)\nT\nT\n\n2.5\n\nModel I\nModel II\n2\n\nm\n\n1.5\n\n\u03a9\n\nAccording to measurements made by the COBE satellite\n[14], this temperature is Tb = 2.725. We can now use\nEqs.

This will put a natural constraint on how far away\nfrom the origin the observer can be located, since a farther off-center position usually means a larger dipole.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nFollowing [1] we will consider LTB models where the inhomogeneity is an underdense bubble with a flat and\nhomogeneous space-time outside. We will consider two\nspecific models of this type corresponding to two different choices of the functions \u03b1(r) and \u03b2(r) in Eqs. (2) and\n(3). We will refer to these as model I and model II. We\nparametrize these function in the same way as in [1], i.e.\nwe write\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 1\nr \u2212 r0\n2 3\n\u03b1(r) = H0 r \u03b10 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1\n(28)\n\u2212 tanh\n2 2\n2\u2206r\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 1\nr \u2212 r0\n\u03b2(r) = H02 r2 \u03b20 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2\n(29)\n\u2212 tanh\n2 2\n2\u2206r\nwhich corresponds to a smooth interpolation between\ntwo homogeneous regions (i.e. a spherical bubble in an\notherwise homogeneous universe). The parameter H0 =\n\n100 houtkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is the Hubble constant of the outer\nhomogeneous region today, while \u03b10 and \u03b20 = 1 \u2212 \u03b10\nare the relative densities of matter and curvature in this\nregion. Further, \u2206\u03b1 = \u2212\u2206\u03b2 determines the difference\nin matter density between the regions, while r0 and \u2206r\nspecify the position and width of the transition.\nIn our previous work [1], we assumed that the observer\nwas positioned at the center of the bubble, and found\na model that gave a good agreement with the Hubble\ndiagram of observed SNIa and the position of the first\nCMB peak. Model I is identical to this model, while\nmodel II is slightly different. The matter distribution today for these models is plotted in Fig. 2, where we have\nused the generalized matter density defined in [1]. Various other properties of these are listed in Tab. I. One\nnotable difference between these two models is that the\ntransition from the underdensity to the homogeneous region is much sharper in the second model. Note that the\nphysical values given in the table are found assuming that\nthe observer is placed at the center. The shift parameter\nS is defined in [1], and is simply the shift of the first peak\nin the CMB power spectrum relative to the concordance\n\u039bCDM model. As we can see, both models yield a very\ngood fit to both SNIa and the first CMB peak.\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the solutions of the geodesic equations\nfor two off-center observers in the two models, with the\nobservers located 20 Mpc and 200 Mpc from the center.\nThe blue lines show the photon paths in the metric (r, \u03b8)\nspace, while the red circles are the positions of incoming\nphotons at evenly spaced points in (cosmic) time. The\ndistortion of light paths is clearly visible on the bottom\nplot of Fig. 4, in which the observer is placed relatively\nfar from the center of the inhomogeneity and the density\ngradient is large at the transition.\nIn our calculations, recombination is assumed to occur at\n\n\f5\nSymbol Model I Model II\n\nDensity contrast parameter\n\n\u2206\u03b1\n\n0.90\n\n0.78\n\nTransition point [Gpc]\n\nd0\n\n1.34\n\n1.68\n\nTransition width\n\n\u2206d/d0\n\n0.40\n\n0.03\n\nFit to supernovae\n\n\u03c72SN\n\n176.2\n\n177.8\n\nPosition of first CMB peak\n\nS\n\n1.006\n\n1.002\n\nAge of the universe [Gyr]\n\nt0\n\n12.8\n\n12.7\n\nRelative density at the center\n\n\u03a9m,in\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nRelative density outside underdensity\n\n\u03a9m,out\n\n1.00\n\n1.00\n\nHubble parameter at the center\n\nhin\n\n0.65\n\n0.63\n\nHubble parameter outside underdensity\n\nhout\n\n0.51\n\n0.51\n\nr sin\u03b8\n\nDescription\n\nTABLE I: The parameters and features of two inhomogeneous\nmodels, with the observer placed at the center.

Using Eqs. (26) and (27),\n\nwe can now calculate the temperature multipoles seen by\nsuch an observer. As an example, a plot of the multipoles can be seen in Fig. 5 for an observer who is located\n200 Mpc from the center in model I.\nIn Fig. 6, the coefficients al0 for the dipole (l = 1),\nquadrupole (l = 2) and octopole (l = 3) are plotted\nas functions of the observer's position in model I. The\nmost striking feature of these plots is that the quadruand octopoles are very small compared to the dipole. If\nwe assume that the induced dipole must be smaller than\n10\u22123 , the induced quadrupole is less than 10\u22127 while the\ninduced octopole is smaller than 10\u22129 .\nIn Fig. 7, the al0 's of model II are plotted as functions\nof the observer's position. It is evident that the behavior\nis almost indistinguishable from that of Model I, except\nfor the largest distances where the transition from underdensity to flat space is starting to show in the first\nmodel.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: Temperature anisotropy in galactic coordinates seen by an observer 200 Mpc from the center of Model I, oriented so\nthat the induced dipole coincides with the direction of the dipole seen by the COBE satellite [14].

The dotted lines are linear, quadratic and cubic fits,\nrespectively.\n\n\f7\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe main purpose of this paper has been to determine the\nmaximum displacement of the observer from the origin of\nthe underdensity, for which the induced CMB dipole remains in agreement with the results observed by COBE\n[2]. Of course, one could in principle introduce an additional peculiar velocity towards the center of the underdensity to compensate for a too large induced dipole,\nbut such a coincidence would be very difficult to justify.\nTherefore, we must require the induced a10 to be of order\n10\u22123 or less, which from the plots in Figs. 6 and 7 can\nbe translated to\ndobs . 15 Mpc .\n\n(30)\n\nwhere d is the physical distance. When compared to\nthe size of the underdensity, which according to Fig. 2\nis around 1 500 Mpc, this means that if we are placed\nat a random position inside the bubble, there is roughly\na chance of 1 to 106 that we end up inside the region\nallowed by Eq. (30). This is a rather strong violation of\nthe Copernican principle, which states that we are not\nsituated at a special place in the universe. On the other\nhand, a 10\u22126 probability is still much better than the\ninfinitely improbable case of the observer being exactly\nat the center of the underdensity. Note that the size of\nthe underdensity is dictated by the fit to the CMB and\nSNIa data. We have not been able to find smaller bubbles\nthat fit these data as well as the models considered here.\nFrom Figs. 6 and 7 we see that the induced multipoles\nbecome larger the farther away from the origin the observer is located, as we would expect. Thus, the largest\npossible quadru- and octopoles with a dipole compatible with COBE measurements are those for an observer\nabout 15 Mpc from the origin. However, at this relatively small distance, the values for these are of the order\n10\u22127 for the quadrupole, and 10\u22129 for the octopole. It\nis therefore clear that the induced quadru- and octopole\ncannot explain the observed alignment of the low-l multipoles in the CMB, since their contributions are negligible\ncompared to the observed anisotropies (which are of order 10\u22125 ). Furthermore, any off-center placement must\nnecessarily result in axial symmetric contributions to the\nCMB spectrum. Even if such contributions were of the\ncorrect order, Raki\u0107 et al. [16] show that they are very\nunlikely to explain the alignment.\nThe smallness of the induced multipoles can be understood from a simplified Newtonian picture. Compared\nto the homogeneous case with a spatially constant Hubble parameter hout , the observer at dobs has a \"peculiar\nvelocity\" of roughly\n\u03b2=\n\nvp\nhin \u2212 hout\n=\ndobs\nc\n3000 Mpc\n\n(31)\n\nwith respect to the origin. In such a picture, the temperature anisotropies measured by the observer are at-\n\ntributed to a Doppler shift of the CMB photons due to\nhis motion. The change in frequency can then be written\nas [17]\np\n\u03bdo\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n=\n,\n(32)\n\u03bde\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03be\nwhere \u03bdo is the frequency measured by the observer,\nand \u03bde is the frequency relative to a stationary background. The temperature shift associated with this frequency shift of the CMB photons is\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\nTo\n=\n.\n(33)\nTe\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03be\nThe average background temperature measured by the\nobserver will then be\np\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nTe 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2\n1+\u03b2\n1\n. (34)\nln\nd \u03a9To (\u03be) =\nTbo =\n4\u03c0\n2\n\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\nThus, the temperature anisotropy can be written as\n\u0398(\u03be) =\n\n\u2206T (\u03be)\n2\n\u03b2\n\u0011\n= \u0010\n\u22121.\n1+\u03b2\nb\nTo\nln 1\u2212\u03b2 1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03be\n\n(35)\n\nUsing Eq. (27), the multipoles can now be calculated in\nterms of the velocity of the observer. We find that the\nleading contribution to al0 is \u03b2 l ,\nal0 \u223c \u03b2 l \u223c dlobs .\n\n(36)\n\nThus, using this simplified Newtonian picture, we expect\nthe dipole to scale linearly, the quadrupole quadratically,\nand the octopole cubically with the observers position.\nIn Figs. 6 and 7 we have plotted the real dependence\nof these multipoles on the observers position along with\na best-fit dlobs dependence. As we see, the Newtonian\npicture gives a very good description. The expressions\nfor the three lowest multipoles to the lowest order in \u03b2 is\nq\n4\u03c0 hin \u2212hout\na10 =\n(37)\n3 3000 Mpc dobs ,\nq\n\u0010\n\u00112\n16\u03c0 hin \u2212hout\na20 =\nd2obs ,\n(38)\n45\n3000 Mpc\nq\n\u0010\n\u00113\n16\u03c0 hin \u2212hout\nd3obs .\n(39)\na30 =\n175\n3000 Mpc\n\nNumerically, this approximation yields a10 = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\na20 = 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 and a30 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 for an observer at\ndobs = 15 Mpc in Model I, whereas the exact values are\na10 = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 , a20 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 and a30 = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22129\nrespectively.\n\nEqs. (37)-(39) imply that it is impossible to obtain sufficiently large values for the quadru- and octopole as long\nas the dipole is within the limits set by the COBE data.\nNote, however, that Tomita [18] has previously found\nrelatively large values for the quadrupole in more simplified bubble models (where two homogeneous regions\n\n\f8\nare separated by a massive comoving shell). It is unclear\nto us why the Newtonian approach fails for his models.\nWe have attempted to reproduce his results by introducing very narrow transition regions in our continuous\nmodel, but the results we get for the multipoles are of the\nsame order as those quoted above. We therefore expect\nEq. (36) to be roughly correct for all models of our type.\nIn our analysis so far we have only considered contributions to the multipoles from the off-center placement.\nThere will of course be additional contributions from various sources such as the intrinsic primordial temperature\nanisotropies, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect [19]\nand a non-vanishing peculiar velocity of the observer. We\nhave seen that when the dipole is constrained by data,\nthe quadru- and octopoles due to the off-center placement\nare considerably weaker than those observed in the CMB.\nA possible way to obtain stronger quadru- and dipoles is\nto place the observer farther away from the center, while\nallowing one or more of the effects mentioned above to\ncancel out the excessive contribution to the dipole.\nHowever, concerning the first two effects, it is clear that\nneither of these can achieve such cancellation. Although\nthere is no way of measuring directly the intrinsic dipole,\nit is reasonable to assume that it is of the same order as\nthe neighboring multipoles, which are of order 10\u22125 Similarly, we expect the contribution to the dipole from the\nISW effect to be of the same order as for the quadru- and\noctopole. Therefore, it is very unlikely that these effects\nare responsible for a chance cancellation of an excessive\ncontribution to the dipole from the off-center placement.\n\n[1] H. Alnes, M.

A53, 51 (1933).\n\nA non-vanishing peculiar velocity can reduce the dipole\nto any desired value as long as the velocity is chosen\nlarge enough. However, multipoles due to such motion\nwill have a hierarchical scaling similar to that which we\nshowed in the Newtonian case. Thus, even if we manage\nto obtain values for the dipole and quadrupole of the\ncorrect order, the octopole would still be too weak. From\nthis we can conclude that even when combined with other\neffects, the off-center placement cannot provide sufficient\npower to both the quadru- and octopole.\nIn summary, LTB models like the ones listed in Table I\nare not ruled out on the basis of these results, but they\ndo require a violation of the Copernican principle, since\nthe observer would have to be located at a very special\nplace. The volume within which the observer can be located is severely constrained by the size of the dipole\ninduced by an off-center placement of the observer. As a\nconsequence of this, the quadru- and octopole turn out\nto have insufficient power to explain the observed alignment. However, the LTB models remain an exotic alternative to dark energy as an explanation of the apparent\naccelerated expansion of the universe.\nAcknowledgments\n\nMA acknowledges support from the Norwegian Research\nCouncil through the project \"Shedding Light on Dark\nEnergy\" (grant 159637/V30).
