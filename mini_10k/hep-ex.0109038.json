Introduction\nAlmost 25 years after the discovery of the b quark in proton nucleus collisions [1], the\naccurate understanding of how b quarks are being produced in hadronic environments\nis still an open issue. The subject of beauty production has recently received renewed\ninterest, with the advent of new measurements at the ep collider HERA, and elsewhere.\nThe dominant mechanism for the production of heavy quarks at HERA is photon\ngluon fusion: a photon coupling to the scattered electron interacts with a gluon from\nthe proton by forming a quark antiquark pair, e.g. bb\u0304. A quantitative description of the\nprocess requires the knowledge of the gluon momentum distribution in the proton, the\ncalculation of the hard photon gluon subprocess, and a fragmentation function which\naccounts for the long-range effects binding the heavy quark in a hadron. The gluon\ndensity in the relevant range of momentum fraction x and at the appropriate scales\nis known to an accuracy of a few percent from the analysis of scaling violations of\nthe proton structure function F2 measured at HERA [2]. The partonic process has\nbeen calculated in QCD, at next-to-leading order (NLO). The masses of the charm,\nand even more so of the beauty quark ensure that at least one hard scale is present\nthat renders QCD perturbation theory to be applicable. The fragmentation function is\nextracted from e+ e\u2212 annihilation data, where the kinematics of the hard process is well\ndetermined by a clean initial state. New results on b fragmentation, with significantly\nimproved precision, have appeared recently [3, 4] and are included in this review. With\nsuch precise ingredients, b production at HERA provides a QCD testing ground par\nexcellence. The validity range of the perturbative methods and the universality of nonperturbative phenomenological inputs can be closely examined.\n\u2021 On behalf of the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations.\n\n\fOpen Beauty Production\n\n2\n\nUnderstanding heavy quark production is furthermore essential for the proton\nstructure analysis of inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data [2] in terms of parton\ndistribution functions, since final states with charm account for about a quarter of the\ninclusive rate in the kinematic domain probed at HERA [5]. As shown in more detail\nin [6], the QCD picture sketched above has proven very successful in describing the\nexperimental results on charm production in DIS [5, 7]. The limit of small photon\nvirtuality is equivalent to charm photoproduction. Even in this regime, the picture\nworks reasonably well [7, 8, 9], albeit some further clarification is needed with regard to\nthe treatment of resolved photon processes, where the photon flutuates into a hadronic\nstate which interacts with the proton. Evidently, it is of particular interest to subject\nthe theory to an independent test with beauty production data.\nThe NLO QCD calculations of heavy quark production follow two basic approaches;\nfor a more profound discussion see [10]. The cross section for e.g. photoproduction of\nheavy hadrons factorizes and can be expressed as convolutions of parton distribution\nfunctions for photon and proton, fi\u03b3,p (x\u03b3,p ), respectively, the partonic cross section \u03c3\u0302i,j\n(i, j denoting the parton type), and a non-perturbative fragmentation function D(z),\nwhich maps the subsequent transition of the produced heavy quark into an observable\nheavy hadron, retaining a fraction z of the heavy quark's momentum, symbolically\n\u03c3\u03b3p =\n\nX\ni,j\n\nfi\u03b3 (x\u03b3 ) \u2297 fjp (xp ) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302i,j \u2297 D(z) .\n\n(1)\n\nIn the so-called massive scheme, only light quarks and gluons are active partons in the\ninitial state. The heavy quark mass mQ sets the scale for the perturbative expansion of\n\u03c3\u0302 which has been evaluated up to O(\u03b1s2 ), including mass effects. If a second and different\nlarge scale is present, e.g. at large transverse momentum of the heavy quarks, pT \u226b mQ ,\nthese calculations acquire large logarithms of the ratio pT /mQ , and the fixed order result\nbecomes less reliable. In \"resummed\" calculations [11, 12], in the so-called massless\napproach, the leading terms of this type are absorbed in scale-dependent fragmentation\nfunctions, which obey the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. Different schemes exist\nfor the construction of fragmentation functions. The heavy quarks are treated in the\nsame way as the light quarks. They appear in the initial state structure functions for\nproton and photon and contribute via flavour excitation processes to the production\nof heavy quark final states. However, mass effects in the partonic cross section are\nneglected. The massive and the massless approach thus have complementary ranges of\napplicability \u2013 low and high pT \u2013 which do not necessarily overlap. Recently, \"merged\"\ncalculations interpolating between the schemes have appeared [13]. Only in the massless\nscheme, the factorization theorem guarantees the universality of the fragmentation\nfunctions extracted from e+ e\u2212 data. For the scale-independent function D(z) in the\nmassive scheme, this remains an assumption based on less rigorous arguments.\nThe HERA results for beauty are so far limited by small statistics and dominated by\nproduction near threshold. The calculations supposed to be appropriate in this regime\nfollow the fixed order 'massive' approach and are available in the form of Monte Carlo\nintegration programs for photoproduction [14] and DIS [15]. Due to the higher quark\n\n\f3\n\nOpen Beauty Production\n\nmass, the QCD predictions are expected to be more reliable for beauty than for charm.\nHowever, we note that the NLO corrections to the predicted HERA cross section are\naround 40% of the LO result in both cases.\nIn the next section the measurements performed at HERA will be presented in\ndetail and confronted with theoretical expectations. In a subsequent section, results\nfrom other production environments will be summarized. e+ e\u2212 data on fragmentation\nand measurements of beauty production cross sections in p\u0304p and \u03b3\u03b3 collisions will be\npresented and compared with QCD calculations which follow the same principles as for\nep collisions. In the last part, we will come back to HERA and discuss the potential\noffered by the HERA upgrade programme [16, 17] for further studies in the field.\n2. Measurements of beauty production at HERA\nBeauty production at HERA is suppressed by two orders of magnitude with respect to\ncharm, due to the larger mass and smaller electric charge of the b quark. The total cross\nsection is dominated by photoproduction. Final states are characterized by a steeply\nfalling pT spectrum, which represents a challenge for secondary vertex detection. With\nmb /mc \u223c 3, the minimally required momentum fractions of the initial state gluon is\nabout 10 times higher than for charm production; typical values of x are around 10\u22122 and\nextend up to a few times 10\u22121 . The corresponding boosts relative to the laboratory frame\nare such that most b quarks produced at HERA are emitted under central rapidities into\ndetector regions well covered by existing [18] or to be commissioned [17] Silicon tracking\ndevices.\nAll HERA measurements of b production so far rely on inclusive semi-leptonic\ndecays, using identified muons or electrons in dijet events. A beauty candidate with\na distinctive two-jet structure and the clean signature of a penetrating muon track is\nshown in figure 1.

Cross section for the production of electrons in dijet events, as a function\nof prel\nT ; extrapolated b quark cross section compared with NLO QCD.\n\nobservables have been used which are based on the mass of the b quark or on its lifetime.\nThe high mass gives rise to large values of the transverse momentum prel\nT of the decay\nlepton relative to the direction of an associated jet (see figure 1). Both collaborations\nhave published photoproduction results [19, 20] using this method. More recently, with\nthe precision offered by the H1 vertex detector [18] it has become possible to observe\ntracks from secondary b vertices and to exploit the long lifetime as a b tag.\nThe ZEUS analysis has been discussed in its preliminary version at the previous\nRingberg workshop [21] and has meanwhile been published [20]. It uses electrons which\nare identified in the ZEUS detector by means of the topology of calorimetric energy\ndeposition and of the specific energy loss dE/dx measured in the central track detector.\nBackground from hadrons misidentified as electrons is statistically subtracted. Nonprompt electrons, mostly from photon conversions, are identified on the basis of track\ntopology and invariant mass criteria. From a sample of e+ p data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 38.5 pb\u22121 , a signal of 943 \u00b1 69 electrons attributed to heavy\nquark decays is extracted. Performing the procedure in bins of prel\nT and correcting for\nefficiency, the differential cross section shown in figure 2 is obtained. Overlaid is the\nresult of a Monte Carlo simulation of beauty and charm production, using the HERWIG\ngenerator [22]. The normalization is adjusted to that of the data, and the shape is fitted\nby varying the relative contributions of charm and beauty. The fit yields a beauty\nfraction of fb = (14.7 \u00b1 3.8) % in the sample, close to the HERWIG expectation of 16 %.\nThis is translated into a cross section for the visible kinematic range,\n+4.2\n\u03c3eb\u2192e\n+ p\u2192e+ +dijet+e\u2212 +X = 24.9 \u00b1 6.4\u22127.3 pb\n\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nThe range is defined by the requirements on the photon virtuality, Q2 < 1 GeV2 ,\nthe inelasticity variable 0.2 < y < 0.8, the jet rapidity |\u03b7| < 2.4, the transverse jet\njet\nenergy ET > 7(6) GeV for the (second) most energetic jet, the transverse momentum\npeT > 1.6 GeV and rapidity |\u03b7| < 1.1 of the electron.\n\n\fOpen Beauty Production\n\n5\n\nIn a similar manner, the cross section has also been measured as a function of x\u03b3 ,\nan observable which is calculated from the energies and rapidities of the jets and which\nin the leading-order picture corresponds to the momentum fraction of the parton in\nthe resolved photon entering the hard process. (For direct interactions of the photon\nx\u03b3 \u2248 1.) The x\u03b3 spectrum allows a resolved contribution of (28 \u00b1 5(stat.)) % to be\nestimated in this picture. The HERWIG expectation is 35 %, which in this program is\nmostly due to flavour excitation in the photon. Due to the small beauty component in\nthe sample, this does not allow conclusions on the b production dynamics to be drawn,\nbut it corroborates earlier observations on charm, made by ZEUS with D \u2217 mesons in\ndijet events [9].\nThe visible cross section can directly be compared with leading order Monte\nCarlo predictions, which are 8 pb for HERWIG [22] and 18 pb for PYTHIA [23]\n(also including flavour excitation). The recently developed CASCADE program [24],\nbased on unintegrated parton distributions and the CCFM evolution equation [25],\nfollows a different approach to account for higher order QCD effects. As shown in a\nseparate contribution to this workshop [26], the approach is able to reproduce results\non b production at the Tevatron. The CASCADE prediction for HERA in the ZEUS\nkinematic range is 18 pb [27].\nIn order to compare the measured cross sections with QCD predictions, the Monte\nCarlo simulation is used to convert the result into a b quark cross section for a range\nb\nrestricted in terms of parton kinematic variables to pb\nT > 5 GeV, |\u03b7 | < 2 and to the\nsame Q2 and y range as above.

The theoretical curve lies below the measurement.\nThe first observation of b production at HERA by H1 [19] was based on the prel\nT\nmethod, too, and has also been presented at the previous workshop of this series [21].\nWe focus here on the more recent work based on the lifetime signature, which improves\nthe photoproduction result [28] and provides a first measurement in DIS [29].\nThe H1 central silicon tracker (CST) [18] consists of two cylindrical layers of silicon\nstrip detectors, surrounding the beam pipe at radii of R = 57.5 mm and R = 97 mm,\nrespectively, from the beam axis. With an effective length of 358 mm it covers a large\npart of the ep interaction region and has a polar angle acceptance of 300 < \u03b8 < 1500\nfor the outer layer, for particles emanating from the nominal interaction point. Double\nsided silicon detectors with readout strip pitches of 50 \u03bcm and 88 \u03bcm provide resolutions\nof 12 \u03bcm in r\u03c6 and 25 \u03bcm in z. The analyses presented here are performed in the\ntransverse plane. For tracks with CST hits in both layers, the achieved resolution of\nthe transverse distance dca to the center of the H1 detector can be parameterized as\n\u03c3dca \u2248 40 \u03bcm \u2295 100 \u03bcm/pT [GeV].

The resolution provided by the CST reveals that the muon\ntrack originates from a secondary vertex well separated from the beam spot ellipse. A\nsimple and robust technique to exploit such signatures is using the impact parameter\n\u03b4. Its magnitude is given by the dca of the track to the primary event vertex, and its\nsign is positive or negative, depending on the intercept of the track with the jet axis\nbeing downstream or upstream of the primary vertex (see figure 3). Decays of long-lived\nparticles are signalled by positive impact parameters, whereas the finite track resolution\nyields a symmetric distribution.\nIn order to establish the method, the lifetime-based analysis is performed by\napplying a similar selection of dijet events with identified muons as for the published\nprel\nT analysis in photoproduction. Jets are reconstructed here using the inclusive kt\nalgorithm [30] and required to have transverse energies ET > 5 GeV. For each muon\ncandidate track, the impact parameter \u03b4 is calculated, which requires the precise\nknowledge of the ep interaction point. The transverse profile of the interaction region\nat HERA has a Gaussian width of about 150 \u03bcm in the horizontal and of about 40 \u03bcm\nin the vertical direction. Average beam coordinates determined from many consecutive\nevents are used to constrain the primary vertex fit applied to CST measured tracks\nin each individual event, excluding the muon track under consideration. A typical \u03b4\nresolution of 90 \u03bcm has been achieved with comparable contributions from the muon\n\n\f7\n\nOpen Beauty Production\nData (prel.)\nFit\nbeauty\ncharm\nfake muons\n\nH1\n2\n\nMuons / 50 \u03bcm\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n0.05\n\u03b4 [ cm ]\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nFigure 4.

The fitted charm fraction is also compatible with the H1 measurement of\nD \u2217 photoproduction [8].\nTo further establish the consistency of the sample composition in the two\nobservables \u03b4 and prel\nT , the b component in the events is enriched by restricting the\nrange of one variable and then studying the distribution of the other. Figure 5 shows\nthe observed \u03b4 spectrum after a prel\nT cut. The different contributions shown in Figure 5\nare the absolute predictions for the limited prel\nT region, evaluated from the \u03b4 fit to the\nfull sample. The observed impact parameter spectrum and the fit prediction, with a\ndominating beauty component, agree within errors. Vice versa, the prel\nT spectrum after\na cut on \u03b4 agrees within errors with the fit prediction for a b enriched sample. Since the\ntwo observables are consistent and only weakly correlated, they can be combined in a\nlikelihood fit to the two-dimensional (\u03b4, prel\nT ) distribution.

The distributions were folded with a lepton spectrum for b decays\nextracted from the AROMA [32] Monte Carlo generator. The results are 54 \u00b1 9 pb for\nphotoproduction and 11 \u00b1 2 pb for DIS, where the error is predominantly due to the b\nquark mass uncertainty. The expectations are much lower than the H1 measurements.\nThe data have also been compared with the LO Monte Carlo predictions. The AROMA\nprogram [32], following a \"massive\" approach, gives 38 and 9 pb for photoproduction\nand DIS, respectively. The CASCADE Monte Carlo results [24, 27] of 66 pb and 15 pb,\nrespectively, also fall considerably below the measurements.\nWe note that both the H1 and ZEUS experiments observe only a tiny fraction of the\ntotal phase space. In photoproduction, the seen numbers of events correspond to 25 pb\n(H1) and 4 pb (ZEUS). This difference is partially due to different jet energy and y ranges\nand to the fact that ZEUS uses only e\u2212 , but H1 muons of both signs and in addition\nincludes a contribution of about 15% of secondary muons. Both experiments extrapolate\nby comparable factors\u00a7 to compare with theory, but in different ways. ZEUS corrects for\nthe lepton selection and translates the jet cuts into quark kinematics, whereas H1 keeps\nthe lepton cuts but corrects for the jet requirements altogether. The measurements\ncan best be compared when normalized to the same theory. However, the comparisons\nof the experimental results with calculations and with each other are still affected by\nthe uncertainties related to the extrapolations. That these uncertainties are sufficiently\nassessed by using the various available models, remains an assumption not yet backed\nby experimental data. To reduce them, the distributions and correlations characterizing\nthe final state topologies must be constrained by more refined measurements.\nWe summarize the HERA results as a function of Q2 in Fig. 7. Displayed is\nthe ratio of the measured cross sections over theoretical expectations based on the\nNLO QCD calculations [14, 15]. The ratio is consistent with being independent of\nQ2 ; which indicates that the discrepancy between data and theory is not a feature of\nthe photoproduction regime alone. At larger Q2 , resolved contributions involving the\npartonic structure of the photon are expected to be suppressed [33], the DIS case is\ntherefore complementary and theoretically cleaner.\n\u00a7 Note that the ZEUS cross section is corrected for the semileptonic branching ratio, while the H1\ncross section is not.\n\n\f10\n\nOpen Beauty Production\n\n\u03c3\nData / Theory\n\nvis\n\n6\n5\n\n(ep \u2192 b X)\n\nH1 \u03bc pTrel\nH1 \u03bc impact param.

Beauty production in e+ e\u2212 , \u03b3\u03b3 and p\u0304p interactions\nThe theoretical understanding of b production data must always revert to a description\nof the fragmentation process, since only hadrons can be observed experimentally. Since\nthe formation of hadrons involves non-perturbative effects of long-range binding forces, it\ncannot be calculated from first principles. Yet, e+ e\u2212 collisions provide a clean laboratory\nto study the process directly and to extract the non-perturbative parameters of the\nfragmentation function. This is nowadays best done using data taken at the Z resonance,\nwhere millions of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2192 bb\u0304 events have been recorded. One observes the\ndistribution of xB = Ewd /Ebeam , the fractional energy of the weakly decaying b hadron,\nnormalized to the maximally available energy. Final data from LEP and SLC with\nunprecedented precision are now becoming available. Figure 8 shows results published\nby ALEPH [3], using D (\u2217) meson lepton correlations, and by SLD [4], using an inclusive\nsecondary vertexing technique. Earlier OPAL results [34] with larger errors are shown\nfor comparison; preliminary data from SLD, with even higher statistical precision, have\nalso been released [35]. The ALEPH data are compared to two Monte Carlo simulations,\nwhich are using different functional forms [31, 36] for the parameterization of the nonperturbative fragmentation function. The Peterson form does not describe the data\nwell; a similar observation is made by SLD [4].\nSeveral comments are in order here. The observed xB spectra reflect the effects of\nperturbative gluon radiation and of the non-perturbative hadronization phase together;\nthe models must include both. Conclusions from the comparison with data can only\nbe drawn for the convolution of the two effects, which is here the combination of the\nPeterson function with the leading log parton shower approach [37] used to model the\n\n\f11\n\nOpen Beauty Production\n1/N dN/dxB\n\nwd\n\nALEPH\n\n3.5\nData\n\n3\n\nSLD\nModel Dependence\nOPAL\n\n3\n1/NdN/dxB\n\nPeterson\n\n2.5\n\nKartvelishvili\n\n2\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nwd\nxB\n\n0\n\n12-99\n8515A2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nxB\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 8. Measurements of the b hadron fragmentation function.\n\nperturbative part in the Monte Carlo simulation. When combined with resummed NLO\ncalculations [11, 38], the Peterson function was found to be adequate. However, the\nprecision of the new data presents a challenge which these calculations have not yet\nmet.\nFor the interpretation of the HERA measurements, these discrepancies are too\nsmall to be relevant. Altogether, the fragmentation results leave little room to modify\nQCD predictions for other production modes; in particular the function cannot be much\nharder than commonly assumed, in contrast to what would be needed to obtain larger\npredictions in the case of cuts on falling pT spectra. Since the fragmentation is harder\nthan in the charm case, the influence of the non-perturbative versus perturbative effects\nis generally suppressed. Once higher accuracy is required, one may have to turn back\nto the problem of how to extract a fragmentation function in a scheme consistent with\nthe massive approach. While fixed order calculations could still provide an acceptable\ndescription of ARGUS data [39] on D \u2217 production, this appears to be difficult in the\ncase of B mesons produced on the Z resonance [40, 38].\nWith the increase of the LEP energy towards the 200 GeV range, it has become\npossible to observe beauty production in two-photon collisions. The process is\ndominated by direct and single resolved interactions, i.e. by photon-photon and photongluon fusion, which contribute with roughly equal strength [41]. The b quarks are\npredominantly produced at small pT . They are tagged via identified electrons or muons\nfrom semileptonic decays, using the prel\nT signature together with jets with as little as\n3 GeV energy. The cross section, measured by L3 [42], is shown in figure 9 together with\nresults for charm production. The NLO QCD calculations [41], shown for comparison,\nhave been obtained in the massive approach; corrections beyond LO amount to about\n30 %. While the agreement is good for charm production, the beauty cross section is\nunderestimated by more than a factor of 2.

Measurements of charm and beauty production in two-photon collisions.\n\nconfirmed by a preliminary OPAL result [43], see figure 9.\nThat the pattern of results resembles the one encountered at HERA may be not\naccidental. There are many theoretical and experimental similarities, e.g. the necessity\nto model heavy quark fragmentation and jets near threshold. The QCD approach follows\nthe same scheme; like in photoproduction it relies on phenomenological input to describe\nthe hadronic structure of the photon.\nThe b production cross section in p\u0304p collisions has been found in excess of QCD\n\u221a\npredictions since the turn-on of the Tevatron collider [44]. At s = 1.8 TeV gluon\ngluon fusion is the dominant mechanism. The measurements have meanwhile been\nperformed using a variety of channels and techniques, and they cover a large range in\ntransverse momentum. Results from CDF and D0 are summarized in figure 10. The two\nexperiments are consistent with each other. There are still new results being released,\nfor example using signals of exclusively reconstructed B + mesons [45], which by virtue of\nsecondary vertex detection reside on low background and allow measurements with very\nsmall systematic uncertainty. In general, the cross section is found to be above the NLO\nQCD expectation [46]. However, the figure shows that the excess cannot be absorbed\nin a simple scaling factor, but has some pT dependence. We also note that an increase\nof the excess with rapidity is observed [47]. While these results are based on b hadron\ndetection, it has been suggested to measure the b tagged jet cross section instead [48].\nThe theoretical calculation should be safer against soft and collinear effects, and the\nconfrontation with data less sensitive to assumptions on the fragmentation process. The\npreliminary jet data from D0 [49] are also shown in figure 10. Indeed, the agreement with\ntheory is better. Yet, there is a similar trend for the data to be higher than the central\nprediction, so that no disagreement between the two sets of results can be claimed.\nThe longstanding discrepancy between b hadroproduction data and theory has\nstimulated speculations about possible explanations beyond the standard model. For\n\n\f13\n\nOpen Beauty Production\n\nFigure 10. Measurements of the b cross section, as a function of the minimum quark\npT ; b jet cross section, as a function of the jet transverse energy.\n\nexample, a scenario [50] in the context of minimal supersymmetry, with relatively light\ngluinos g\u0303 and sbottom quarks b\u0303, can easily reproduce the data, as demonstrated in\nfigure 11. There are further consequences that can be tested at the Tevatron; for\nHERA however, first estimates indicate only small effects in this particular scenario.\nIt is nevertheless interesting to note that such an interpretation is not ruled out by\nexisting experimental constraints, including the e+ e\u2212 continuum data and precision\nmeasurements or direct searches performed at the Z and \u03a5(4S) resonances (see [50] and\n\n10 5\n\nSum\nQCD\ng~ \u2192 b\n\n\u03c3b(pT \u2265 pmin\nT ) (nb)\n\n10 4\n\nD0 Data\n\n10 3\n\nCDF Data\n\n10 2\n\n\u221aS = 1.8 TeV\n10\n\nmg~ = 14 GeV\nmb~ = 3.5 GeV\n\n1\n\n10\n\nmb = 4.75 GeV\n-1\n\n10\n\nmin\n\n10\n\n2\n\npT (GeV)\n\nFigure 11.\nb cross section data, compared with a model assuming light\nsupersymmetric sbottom quark production; CDF data in comparison with a resummed\nNLO QCD calculation in the massless scheme.\n\n\fOpen Beauty Production\n\n14\n\nreferences therein).\nA more conventional approach is to refine the QCD calculations. The large scale\ndependence, which is still present at NLO, indicates that important contributions are\nmissing in the perturbative expansion of the cross section. In figure 11, the B meson\ncross section [51] is compared to a resummed calculation [52] in the massless scheme,\nusing perturbative fragmentation functions directly adjusted to LEP data. A good\ndescription is found, surprisingly also for the data at lower pT , where the agreement\nfor this scheme is considered as fortuitous by the authors of [52]. However, a similar\n\"surprise\" was found in the case of charm photoproduction at HERA [7, 9]. A cross\nsection enhancement in the medium pT range of the Tevatron data is also found, using\nhigh pT resummation via fragmentation functions in a different scheme [53]. There\nare other resummation strategies being pursued [24, 54], namely using the concept\nof unintegrated parton densities, which is discussed in more detail in [26]. These\napproaches lead to enhancements of the predictions.\nThe experimental precision can be expected to improve even further, when results\nfrom the upgraded Tevatron become available, and this should provide additional\nguidelines to find out which strategy most effectively includes the missing higher oder\ncontributions. In either case, whether speculations on supersymmetry will further\nbe nourished, or whether \"only\" the QCD techniques will be refined, complementary\ninformation from HERA will be extremely valuable. Apart from e+ e\u2212 annihilation, DIS\nrepresents the cleanest b production environment.\n4. Prospects for the HERA upgrade\nThe HERA collider is currently resuming its operation, after an upgrade which lays\nthe foundations for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 to be accumulated in the next\n5 years. Much of the experimental upgrade program which was pursued in parallel by the\nH1 [16] and ZEUS [17] collaborations is directed towards augmenting the capabilities\nfor heavy quark physics, notably by improving the acceptance and precision of the\ntracking systems, in particular for forward-going particles, and by enhancing the trigger\nsensitivity for final states with small pT .\nThe HERA results on beauty production are statistically limited, and it is evident\nthat higher luminosity would be beneficial. Here we ask more specifically the question\nwhether it will be possible to vary the two scales p2T and Q2 independently and over\na range extending significantly beyond the one set by the quark mass, 4m2b . This\nwould open kinematic regions to investigate the regime most relevant for improving\nthe perturbative QCD calculation. Figure 12 shows the estimated number of beauty\ncandidates to be expected if the H1 muon analysis described in section 2 would be\nextended in its present form to the full anticipated HERA II statistics. The event yield is\ndisplayed as a function of the transverse momentum of the b quark in the hadronic centreof-mass system. Reasonable results can be obtained with samples of about 100 events.\nThus, in photoproduction (DIS) measurements up to pT \u2248 25(15) GeV will be possible.\n\n\f15\n\nOpen Beauty Production\n\nevents / bin\n\nH1 beauty\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1 fb-1\n\u03b3p\nDIS\n2\n2\nQ > 100 GeV\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n40\npt(b) (had.CMS)\n\nFigure 12. Estimated numbers of events, as a function of the b quark transverse\nmomentum in the partonic CMS, for an extension of the present H1 muon analysis to\nthe expected full HERA data set.\n\nIn the high Q2 regime, more inclusive techniques will be needed to extend the range\nbeyond pT \u2248 10 GeV. With the correlation of x and Q2 at HERA in mind, one can\nforesee meaningful tests of low x or high pT resummation approaches.\nZEUS is presently being equipped with a micro-vertex detector [17], while first\nresults obtained with the H1 silicon tracker have been described here. A major goal is to\napply inclusive secondary vertex tagging methods with algorithms similar to those used\nat the Tevatron or at LEP, where they provided very pure b samples with efficiencies of\n20 % and higher. Impact parameter resolutions at HERA are similar, and the luminosity\nupgrade by means of stronger beam focusing has the appreciated side effect of reducing\nthe size of the interaction region to 80 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm2 , to be compared with 110 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm2 , e.g.\nat LEP. It is difficult to seriously predict b tagging efficiencies for HERA, because they\ndepend crucially on how effectively charm and light quark background can be suppressed;\nexcellent control of tracking systematics is a key issue here. The method will work the\nbetter, the higher pT and thus the vertexing accuracy is. It can complement the more\nexclusive channels in the region where they suffer most from limited statistics. It will\nbe interesting to check at HERA whether the better description of b jet data found in\np\u0304p interactions (figure 10) is a general feature.\nExtending the measurements, on the other hand, towards low pT holds the promise\nof reducing the model uncertainties related to the extrapolations into the region where\nthe cross section is largest. This could be achieved by replacing the semi-leptonic\nsignature relying on jets by (semi-)exclusive decay modes involving reconstructed D \u2217 or\nJ/\u03a8 mesons. Due to the higher background levels at lower pT , enhanced discrimination\npower is required online to fully benefit from the higher luminosity. H1 is installing\nnew systems [16] using latest generation electronics, which will allow to detect invariant\n\n\fOpen Beauty Production\n\n16\n\nmass signatures at the trigger level. ZEUS plans to incorporate the vertex detector into\nthe trigger.\nFinally, both experiments are upgrading their forward tracking systems with new\ndrift chambers and silicon detectors [17, 16]. This will increase the lever arm in x (and\n> 0.1,\nQ2 ) for QCD studies, probe the gluon distribution in a different region, up to x \u223c\nand give better access to the region where resolved photon processes are important.\nMoreover, since at HERA the production of heavy particles, due to necessarily large x\nvalues involved, leads to final states boosted into the forward direction, these upgrades\nwill open possibilities to use beautiful signatures in searches for new physics, for example\nthe anomalous production of single top quarks, for which candidates exist [55], but not\nwith a b tag.\nIn conclusion, in disclosing beauty at HERA, we are entering a field which is\nexperimentally challenging, theoretically rewarding, and potentially exciting.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank the organizers for composing a stimulating meeting, as unique\nand irreplaceable as its venue. I am indebted to E. Elsen, L. Gladilin, B. Kniehl and\nM. Kuze for their careful reading of the manuscript.\nReferences\n[1] S. W. Herb et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 39 (1977) 252.\n[2] C. Adloff et al.
