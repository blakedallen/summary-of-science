We comment on related phenomena in heavy-ion collisions\nfor the production of quark matter fields from highly occupied gauge bosons.\nPACS numbers: 11.10.Wx,98.80.Cq,12.38.Mh\n\nThe precise understanding of phenomena out of equilibrium plays a crucial role for our knowledge about the\nprimordial Universe. Important examples are the generation of density fluctuations, nucleosynthesis, or baryogenesis, with the latter being responsible for our own\nexistence.\nMost dramatic processes such as far-from-equilibrium\nparticle production at the end of inflation pose a particular theoretical challenge [1]. The corresponding nonperturbative phenomenon of preheating is conventionally\ndescribed using classical approximations for the bosonic\ninflaton [2]. Their validity for macroscopic occupation\nnumbers has been verified explicitly in quantum field\ntheory [3]. Much less is known about fermion dynamics in the nonperturbative regime of high Bose occupation numbers. Since identical fermions cannot occupy the\nsame state, their quantum nature is highly relevant and\na consistent quantum theory of fermion production after\ninflation is of crucial importance. Related questions arise\nin the context of heavy-ion collision experiments, where\nthe production of quark matter fields from highly occupied gauge bosons can occur far from equilibrium [4].\nSo far, preheating dynamics with fermions has been\nmainly investigated based on semiclassical descriptions\nusing the Dirac equation with coupling to a homogeneous\ninflaton field [5]. Also backreaction of fermions onto inflaton dynamics has been included. A similar semiclassical prescription has been used to compute quark production from classical gluons in the context of heavy-ion\ncollisions [6]. Further inclusion of quantum corrections\nis complicated by a secular perturbative time evolution\nwhich becomes rapidly invalid. Suitable approximations\nmay be based on the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which are known to describe the approach to\nthermal equilibrium [7]. Simplified discussions with these\ntechniques, which evaluate the dynamics for vanishing inflaton field amplitude, exhibit new nonlinear phenomena\nsuch as instability-induced fermion production [8].\nIn this work we present a quantum theory of fermion\n\nproduction following preheating after inflation. We consistently include quantum corrections to next-to-leading\norder (NLO) in the Yukawa coupling between the inflaton field and massless fermions. Even for weak couplings\nthis turns out to change semiclassical or leading-order\n(LO) results so dramatically that we consider a complementary nonperturbative method for comparison. It is\nbased on lattice simulations following the techniques of\nRef. [9]. This treats the fermions exactly, but the inflaton\ndynamics becomes classical statistical. In 3 + 1 dimensions this is computationally expensive and becomes feasible with the implementation of \"low-cost\" fermion algorithms [10]. Remarkably, higher-order corrections turn\nout to leave the NLO results practically unchanged for\nthe considered range of weak couplings.\nIn inflationary cosmology, the Universe at early times\nexpands quasiexponentially in a vacuumlike state. During this stage of inflation, all energy is contained in a\nslowly evolving inflaton field. Eventually the inflaton\nhas to transfer its energy to particles, thereby starting\nthe thermal history of the hot Friedmann universe. If\nthe creation of particles is sufficiently slow (for instance,\nif the inflaton is coupled only gravitationally to the matter fields) this transfer may be described by perturbative decay. However, for a wide range of couplings the\nparticle production is governed by a nonequilibrium instability [1\u20133]. These instabilities are known to lead\nto exponential growth of inflaton occupation numbers\nin long wavelength modes on time scales much shorter\nthan the asymptotic thermal equilibration time. This\nis followed by a turbulent phase with different universal scaling regimes for nonperturbative long wavelength\nmodes [11] and perturbative higher momenta [12]. Despite the differences between early-universe dynamics and\nthe \"little bang\" generated in a heavy-ion collision, there\nare remarkable parallels concerning the role of instabilities and turbulence for the process of thermalization [14].\nTo reveal the production of matter fields from inflaton\ndecay requires the inclusion of fermions. We consider a\n\n\f2\nquantum field theory with interaction of the Yukawa type\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\n(1)\n\u2212\n\u03c8\u0304i (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 )\u03a6\u2020ij + (1 + \u03b3 5 )\u03a6ij \u03c8j ,\nNf\n\n1.0\n\nfor i, j = 1, . . . , Nf massless Dirac fermions, where summation over repeated indices is implied. (We use natural units with ~ = c = kB = 1.) The interaction is\nconstructed to couple the left- and right-handed fermion\nfield components \u03c8L = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 )\u03c8/2, \u03c8R = (1 + \u03b3 5 )\u03c8/2\nfor a nonvanishing expectation value\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\nLO\ntime average LO\nNLO\nlattice simulation\n\n0.8\n\nn\u03c8(t,p)\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n\u03be=0.1\n\n0.4\n\nt\u22c5\u03c30M0=250\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n\u03c6(t) = hTr \u03a6(t, x)i\n\n(2)\n\nof the inflaton field. This describes the generation of an\neffective fermion mass by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Together with the scattering or decay processes implied by (1), the interaction contains the major building\nblocks required to discuss fermion production.\nTo be specific we consider two flavors, Nf = 2, with\nsymmetry group SUL (2) \u00d7 SUR (2) \u223c O(Ns = 4), where\n\u03a6 = (\u03c3 + i~\u03c4 ~\u03c0 ) /2 with Pauli matrices ~\u03c4 and an inflaton\n\u00012\npotential V = m2 (\u03c3 2 +~\u03c0 2 )/2+\u03bb \u03c3 2 + ~\u03c0 2 /4!Ns characteristic for a linear sigma model. For our purposes it will\nbe sufficient to consider dynamics without expansion. In\nchaotic inflationary models, after the end of inflation the\ninflaton field coherently oscillates around the minimum\nof its potential with a very large amplitude. The coupling of the field to its own quantum fluctuations leads\nto the phenomenon of parametric resonance [1]. For realistic scenarios the inflaton mass is required to be about\n6 orders of magnitude smaller than the value of the inflaton field, and the inflaton quartic coupling is about\n10\u221212 . Since simulations are hard to perform for realistic\nhierarchies, we will consider numerical results where the\nmass is an order of magnitude smaller than the inflaton\nwith a coupling \u03bb = 0.1. The realistic case can then be\ninferred from our analytic results for time scales and production rates. Though all results will be for parametric\nresonance in chaotic inflation scenarios, we concentrate\non characteristic properties which are independent of the\nunderlying instability type and details of the model.\nFermion production can be computed from\n1\n[\u03c8(x), \u03c8\u0304(y)] , \u03c1(x, y) = i {\u03c8(x), \u03c8\u0304(y)} .\n2\n(3)\nHere F (x, y) denotes the commutator or statistical twopoint function, and \u03c1(x, y) is the anticommutator of two\nfermion fields or the spectral function. In thermal equilibrium these would be translation invariant and related\nby a fluctuation-dissipation relation in Fourier space:\nFeq (\u03c9, p) = \u2212i[1/2 \u2212 nFD (\u03c9)]\u03c1eq (\u03c9, p) with the FermiDirac distribution nFD (\u03c9) = 1/[exp(\u03c9/T ) + 1] for zero\nnet fermion charge [7]. The question of fermion production out of equilibrium may be discussed in terms\nof a time-dependent occupation number n\u03c8 (t, p), which\nF (x, y) =\n\n0.0\n0.5\n\n1\np/\u03c30M0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Time-dependent fermion occupation number.\n\nstarts out at n\u03c8 (t = 0, p) \u2243 0 after inflation and approaches a constant distribution in equilibrium.

Since in this approximation the result\nis strongly oscillatory, in addition a time average (dashed\nline) over a period of about 20/\u03c30 M0 is displayed. These\ncharacteristic LO properties of fermion occupation numbers, which vary periodically in time governed by resonant excitations, are discussed in Ref. [5].\nIn order to see whether the inclusion of quantum corrections changes these results, we first employ 2PI effective action techniques [7, 13]. The fermion contribution\nin the coupling expansion of the 2PI effective action at\nNLO in g reads diagrammatically:\n\n(6)\nHere the dashed lines denote self-consistently dressed\nfermion propagators and the solid line represents the inflaton propagator.

To see how this difference builds up, we\nconsider in RFigure 2 the total fermion number density\nN\u03c8 (t) = 8 d3 p n\u03c8 (t, p)/(2\u03c0)3 as a function of time.\nBoth LO (dashed) and NLO (solid) results agree rather\nwell at early times at which parametric resonance leads\nto an exponential increase of the inflaton two-point function, F\u03c6 (t, t; p0 ) \u223c A0 e2\u03b30 t . Here \u03b30 denotes the growth\nrate of the maximally amplified momentum mode p0 [1\u2013\n3]. Significant deviations between the LO and NLO\nfermion production occur at the time t\u03c6 where the inflaton field amplitude \u03c6(t) starts to decrease substantially, as can be seen from Figure 3. At this time also the\ng\u03c6(t) contribution to the LO equation of motion (5) is\ndiminished such that the field independent parts at NLO\nbecome important.\nGiven the somewhat unrealistic parameters for the numerical results, it is important to discuss what remains\nfor realistic scenarios. For this we estimate characteristic time scales and production rates analytically. Since\nfermions are not yet copiously produced at t\u03c6 , this time\ncan be obtained from the bosonic sector along the lines\nof Ref. [3]. For realistic hierarchies this yields\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c60\nt\u03c6 \u2243\n.\n(8)\nln\n\u03b30\n\u03c30 M0\nFor physically relevant \u03c60 /M0 \u223c 106 and \u03c30 \u223c O(1) this\n\ntime is indeed of the same order as for the parameters in\nthe numerics above. Apart from the fact that t\u03c6 depends\nonly logarithmically on the mass to amplitude ratio, it is\nwell known that for the employed\nparametric dependence\n\u221a\nof the initial field \u03c60 \u223c 1/ \u03bb the coupling can be scaled\nout of the equation of motion for the rescaled inflaton.\nIt remains to estimate the enhanced fermion production\nrate after t\u03c6 . The amplification at this time is caused by\nthe nonperturbative dependence of F\u03c6 on the inverse of\nthe coupling. Since the loop correction (6) is \u223c g 2 and\ncontains a boson line \u223c F\u03c6 of order 1/\u03bb, these together\nlead to corrections of order \u03be = g 2 /\u03bb. From the imaginary part of the corresponding self-energy the fermion\nproduction rate then scales proportional to \u03be. We have\nexplicitly verified this from the numerics for small \u03be by\nvarying g. As a consequence, the shown numerical results for g = 0.1 underestimate the even more dramatic\nproduction for the physically interesting situation with\n\u03be & 1. We emphasize that the observed phenomenon\nof dynamic enhancement of quantum corrections is not\nrestricted to chaotic inflation and parametric resonance.\nThe large correlations lead to universal behavior [11], and\nthe discussion for tachyonic preheating or spinodal instabilities would follow along the same lines.\nIn view of the dramatic differences between LO and\nNLO results, it remains to demonstrate that higher-order\nquantum corrections do not change our understanding.\nSince the interaction term (1) is quadratic in the fermion\nfields, we 'integrate out' the fermions on a lattice and\nstudy the remaining bosonic effective theory by numerical integration of the equations of motion and Monte\nCarlo sampling [9]. This requires numerical integration\nof the fermion propagator, which becomes feasible in\n3 + 1 dimensions using \"low-cost\" fermion algorithms\nsuggested recently in Ref. [10]. The approach treats the\nfermions exactly. However, the inflaton dynamics becomes classical-statistical, which has been shown in the\n\n\f10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n30\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\ng=0.1\ng=0\n\nt\u22c5\u03c30M0=250\n\n0\n\nX \u03c30M0=125\n0\nX \u03c30M0=100\n0\nX \u03c30M0=75\n\n25\n\u03bb=0.1\n\n\u2206t\u22c5\u03c30M0=75\n\n-i\u03c10V(X0;\u03c9,p)\u22c5\u03c30M0\n\nn\u03c6\u22a5(t,p)\n\n4\n\n0\n\nX \u03c30M0=50\n0\nX \u03c30M0=25\n\n20\n15\n\np/\u03c30M0 \u2248 0\n\n10\n\n\u03be = 0.1\n\n5\n\nt\u22c5\u03c30M0=25\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0.1\n\n1\np/\u03c30M0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\u03c9/\u03c30M0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4: Inflaton occupation number of transverse modes.\n\nFIG. 5: Nonequilibrium fermion spectral function.\n\npast to be an accurate description for the sufficiently\nearly times we are considering here [3, 11].\nRemarkably, the lattice simulation results shown in\nFigure 1 (symbols) agree well with the NLO approximation up to momenta of about 1.3/\u03c30 M0 [15] for the\nemployed small \u03be. We conclude that the distribution indeed exhibits a thermal value neq (0) = 1/2 for massless\nfermions at low momenta, which drops at a characteristic scale \u223c \u03c30 M0 . We emphasize that the inflaton is\nstill far from equilibrium at this stage. Figure 4 shows\nthe inflaton occupation number as a function of momentum at different times, following standard conventions of\nRefs. [1\u20133]. In particular, at time t = 250/\u03c30 M0 the inflaton clearly approaches a nonthermal power-law distribution \u223c 1/|p|4 characteristic for strong turbulence [11].\n\ntype coupling to fermions a similar enhancement of quantum corrections may be observed. This concerns, in particular, also quantum chromodynamics in the presence\nof plasma instabilities. In the context of heavy-ion collisions for large gluon occupation numbers \u223c 1/\u03b1s , where\nthe running gauge coupling \u03b1s is small at sufficiently high\nenergies, a similar enhancement of quantum corrections\nwould have dramatic consequences for quark production.\nWe thank Denes Sexty for collaboration on related topics. This work is supported by the BMBF Grant No.\n06DA9018.\n\nA potentially important application of fermion preheating is the possibility to produce very heavy fermions,\nwhich may be interesting for the problems of dark matter and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. This question can\nbe addressed using the dynamical spectral function (3).\nFor the discussion of \u03c1(x, y) we introduce Wigner coordinates, X = (x + y)/2 and x \u2212 y. For the spatially\nhomogeneous system the spectral function then depends\nin addition only on time X 0 . For the temporal component \u03c10V = tr(\u03b3 0 \u03c1)/4\nR the sum over all frequencies is\nnormalized to one, \u2212i d\u03c9/(2\u03c0) \u03c10V (X 0 ; \u03c9, p) = 1, which\ncorresponds to the equal-time anticommutation relation\nfor fermions. Figure 5 shows NLO results at different\ntimes and |p|/\u03c30 M0 \u2243 0. Initially (dash-dotted curve)\nwe find a double peak at \u03c9 \u2243 0, corresponding to massless fermions, and \u03c9 \u2243 g\u03c60 /Nf characterizing very heavy\nfermion states. At later times these peaks become much\nbroader and lower, which is characteristic for strong correlations without a quasiparticle interpretation.\nTo conclude, we note that for any boson field with\nnonperturbatively large occupation number and Yukawa-\n\n[1] J.
