To date, several direct measurements of this\ncross section have been performed by using a 7Be target[3-9]. The Coulomb\ndissociation of 8B [10-12] and the transfer reaction in order to determine the\nasymptotic normalization constant of the 8B bound state wave function [1,13,14]\nwere also used to determine the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction cross section at solar\nenergies. However it is now very difficult to get the astrophysical S factors\nexperimentally at solar temperature. The lowest energy measured to date is\nabout 100 keV. Therefore an extrapolation based on some nuclear model must\nbe performed to obtain the astrophysical S factors at solar energies. Various\ntheoretical models have been studied recently[15-29]. Generally, the theoretical\nextrapolation at very low energies can not avoid numerical difficulty because the\ninitial state of the system becomes so small that its numerical determination\nbecomes very hard and the computation of the Coulomb functions, which are\nnecessary to fix the asymptotic normalization, is not easy to deal with[26].\nThis numerical difficulty caused most of the previous theoretical researchers\nto use the effective expansion of the S factor or an approximation method in\ncalculating the radial wave functions for the astrophysical S factors near zero\nenergy. The utilization of the transfer reaction in order to determine the asymptotic\n\n\fnormalization constant is\n\none of the methods for avoiding this difficulty.\n\nThe main purposes of this work are to analyze the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction\nat low energies on the basis of a direct radiative capture mechanism and to calculate\nthe astrophysical S factors of the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction near zero energy\nwithout using the effective expansion of the astrophysical S factor or the asymptotic\nwave function. The extranuclear capture process is so dominant at low energies\nthat the direct radiative capture mechanism reproduces the reaction cross section\nfairly well [30]. From the calculations, we can check the validity of various\nextrapolation models. The E1, E2, and M1 transitions are considered in this\ntheoretical research. The numerical difficulties could be overcome by using a 64-bit\ncomputer system.\n\nThe differential radiative capture cross section of the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction\ncan be calculated following the formula by Kim et al.[30,32] Throughout these\ncalculation, E1, E2, and M1 captures from l = 0- 3 partial waves are considered.\nVarious single particle 7Be + p models have been suggested and used to describe\nthe 8B ground state and resonance. The results from microscopic calculations\nindicate that the overlap of the ground state of 8B with that of 7Be is very\nclose to unity[15,27]. The quadrupole moment of 7Li is rather large, so the\nsimilarities of the properties of mirror nuclei suggests that 7Be is considerably\ndeformed[27]. This fact means that the ground state of 8B(2+) would have a\ncontribution from the p1/2 proton coupled to the 7Be(3/2-) channel (p1/2 * 3/2-), as\nwell as (p3/2 * 3/2-. However, unfortunately, we have no data for the spectroscopic\nfactor of p1/2 state in ,\nso we assumed that the bound state of is in the single\nconfiguration 8B(2+) on the 7Be core with central and spin-orbit interactions.\nTo reproduce the bound state wave functions, we started with the conventional\nbound state problem to obtain the experimental separation energy of the ground\nstate of 8B. The parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential obtained for the ground\nstate are Vo = 32.14 MeV, Ro= 2.95 fm, ao= 0.52 fm, and Vs.o.= 1.7 MeV,\nwhich are similar to Tombrello's [31], except for the spin-orbit interaction to be\nconsidered here.\nTo reproduce the radial distorted wave of incident channel, we imposed the\nrestriction that potential parameters for the odd partial waves should reproduce the\npeak position of the 1+ resonance at Ec.m.= 633 keV and that the potential\nparameters for the even partial waves should reproduce the experimental data of\nastrophysical S factors at low energies. However, there are uncertainties in the\nexperimental data at low energies, as shown in Fig. 1. To date, several direct\nmeasurements of 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction cross section have been performed\nwith quoted uncertainties of less than 10 %, but two of these results are larger than\nothers, as shown in Fig.1 [1]. Therefore, we prepared two sets of potential\nparameters for the incident channel. The potential parameters to reproduce\nthe experimental data of Ref. [7-9](Pot A) are Veven = 20.84 MeV, Vodd= 46.03\nMeV, Ro = 2.30fm, ao= 0.65 fm, and Vs.o.= 1.7 MeV. The potential\nparameters to reproduce the experimental data of Ref.[4,5](Pot B) are Veven =\n29.84 MeV, Vodd= 29.84 MeV, Ro = 2.95fm, ao = 0.52 fm, and Vs.o.= 1.7 MeV,\n\n\fwhich are similar to Kim's[30]. Since we were interested in very low energies, we\nhad to be careful in generating accurate Coulomb functions and radial wave\nfunctions. For the present calculation, we adopted a 64-bit computer and\nprogram that could calculate the wave functions with high accuracy. Fig. 1\nshows the calculated astrophysical S factors along with the measured ones.\nOur calculations using Pot. A and Pot. B reproduce well the experimental data of\nRefs. 7-9 and Refs. 4,5 below 0.5 MeV without any normalization factor,\nrespectively. The calculated S values at 0.05 keV were 22.13 eV\u2027 b(Pot. A) and\n24.23 eV\u2027 b(Pot. B), using the same bound state wave function for both cases.\nThis is a striking result, contrary to the existing assumption that the S value near\nzero energy depends on the asymptotic wave function (or asymptotic\nnormalization coefficient). We could confirm this potential dependency of S\nfactor from the fact that the trial potential set\n(Pot. C) for the incident channel,\nVeven= 59.84 MeV, Vodd = 29.84 MeV, Ro = 2.95fm, ao = 0.52 fm, and Vs.o.= 1.7\nMeV, gave an S value at 0.05 keV of 9.39 eV\u2027 b when the same bound state\nfunction was used. The asymptotic condition of k*r>>l in continuum state\nmeans that if k goes to zero, then r goes to infinity. Therefore the overlap integration\nin non-asymptotic region is important at very low energy. This is shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\fWe checked that E2 and M1 captures lead to negligible contributions below 100\nkeV in this reaction. The E1 transitions to the 2+ ground state are dominated\nby the s wave capture at very low energies, but the d wave contribution is not\nnegligible. This is clearly shown in Fig .3 where we display the ratio of d\nwave contribution to the cross section leading to the ground state. We checked that\nin our calculations, the variations in the potential parameters scarcely affected\nthe d wave capture cross section below 0.1 MeV. However the s wave capture\ncross section near zero energy was affected strongly by the shape of nuclear\npotential in this reaction. The calculated s wave capture cross sections at 0.05 keV\nare 18.3 * 10(-223) \u03bcb (Pot.A), 20.2 * 10(-223) \u03bcb (Pot.B), and 6.98 * 10(-223)\n\u03bcb (Pot.C) while the d wave capture cross section has the same value of 1.34 *\n10(-223) \u03bcb for all cases. We attained calculated S values at 20 keV of 21.0\neV\u2027 b (Pot.A) and 23.4 eV\u2027 b (Pot.B) by using the same bound state wave\nfunction for both cases in this single particle model study.\n\n\f[1] A.
