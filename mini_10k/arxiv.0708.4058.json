In recent years it has been increasingly recognized\nthat spin interactions can play a major role in determining physical properties of systems such as\nnanoscale magnets or of interfaces and surfaces. We derive a generalized set of Hedin's equations for\nquantum many-body systems containing spin interactions, e.g. spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions.\nThe corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation is constructed.\nPACS numbers:\n\nAn increasing number of modern applications of materials science imply spin degrees of freedom. Spintronics\ndevices, colossal magneto resistance materials or magnetic impurities in semiconductors are important examples, not only due to their technological interest but also\nowing to the fundamental questions they raise. In fact,\na detailed understanding of such systems requires a theoretical description of the interplay of spin, charge and\norbital degrees of freedom, and relies crucially on a reliable description of electronic interactions. In striking\ncontrast to these scientific and technological needs, the\nactual progress in developing techniques for describing\ninteraction effects beyond density functional theory [1]\nin an explicitly spin-dependent manner has been slow.\nIn particular, one of the most important first principles\nmany-body methods used nowadays for describing electronic excitations, the so-called GW method, still awaits\nits extension to spin-dependent interactions.\nIn 1965, Hedin derived a closed set of equations for the\nelectronic Green's function and self-energy, the screened\nCoulomb interaction and the polarization of a solid [2].\nThe equations provide an iterative scheme for an expansion of the self-energy in powers of the screened interaction. Although there is no guarantee that the iterative procedure is absolutely convergent, as originally\nenvisioned by Hedin, it nevertheless provides a rigorous\nbasis for studying the self-energy of real materials from\nfirst-principles. In particular, the lowest order approximation leads to the GW approximation (GWA) [2, 3, 4]\nwhich has proven very successful in studying one-particle\nexcitation energies of real materials entirely from firstprinciples.\nThe original Hedin's equations were derived for a\nmany-body Hamiltonian with a Coulomb interaction\nonly, without the possibility of having an explicit spindependent interaction. The GWA derived from them\nhas met tremendous progress in describing the electronic\nstructure and excitation spectra of semiconductor-based\nsystems, transition metals and oxides. Due to their restriction to spin-independent interactions it has however\nnot been useful for studying correlation effects arising\n\nfrom spin-dependent interactions in the classes of materials mentioned above. These interactions are crucial,\ndespite the tiny energy scales associated with them. To\ncite an example, the conduction band spin splitting in\nzinc blende semiconductors arising from spin-orbit coupling is only tens of meV and yet it is important for\napplications in spintronics since it determines the spin\nlifetimes as well as inducing spin current in the absence\nof a magnetic field, the so-called Rashba effect [5].\nThe aim of the present work is to present generalized Hedin's equations, suitable for dealing with explicitly spin-dependent interactions. These interactions may\narise from relativistic effects, such as spin-orbit coupling,\nor from an external perturbation like in the case of a\nmagnetic impurity in a semiconductor. With a spindependent interaction it is possible to relate the twoparticle Green's function to functional derivatives of the\none-particle Green's function with respect to an electric\nand a magnetic field. The first order term in the screened\ninteraction of the resulting spin-dependent Hedin's equations yields a generalization of the GW approximation.\nThe Hamiltonian with a spin-dependent two-particle\ninteraction is given by\n\n\u01240 =\n\nXZ\n\n+\n\nd3 r \u03c8\u0302 \u03ba (r)h0 (r)\u03c8\u0302 \u03ba (r)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03ba\n\nZ\n+\n+\n1 X\nd3 rd3 r\u2032 \u03c8\u0302 \u03ba (r)\u03c8\u0302 \u03b2 (r\u2032 )v\u03ba\u03b3\u03b2\u03b7 (r, r\u2032 )\u03c8\u0302 \u03b7 (r\u2032 )\u03c8\u0302 \u03b3 (r).\n+\n2\n\u03ba\u03b2\u03b3\u03b7\n\nwhere h0 is the one-particle Hamiltonian.

For this general Hamiltonian, we will derive the following set of generalized Hedin's equations, relating the\nelectronic self-energy \u03a3 to the Green's function G and the\nscreened interaction W , using the polarization P and the\nvertex function \u039b:\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2) = \u2212\u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b7 G\u03b7\u03b3 (1, 4)\u039bJ\u03b3\u03b2 (4, 2, 5)WJI (5, 1),\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nThe polarization then becomes\nWIJ (1, 2) = vIJ (1, 2) + vIK (1, 3)PKL (3, 4)WLJ (4, 2),\n(3)\nPIJ (1, 2) = \u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b2 G\u03b2\u03b3 (1, 3)\u039bJ\u03b3\u03b7 (3, 4, 2)G\u03b7\u03b1 (4, 1+ ),\n\n(4)\n\nPIJ (1, 2) = \u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b2 G\u03b2\u03b3 (1, 2)\u03c3 J\u03b3\u03b7 G\u03b7\u03b1 (2, 1+ )\nyielding the self-energy\nI\nJ\n\u03a3GW\n\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2) = \u2212\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b7 G\u03b7\u03b3 (1, 2)\u03c3\u03b3\u03b2 WJI (2, 1).\n\n\u039bI\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2, 3) = \u03b4(1 \u2212 2)\u03b4(2 \u2212 3)\u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b4\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2)\nG\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 (4, 6)\u039bI\u03b7\u2032 \u03ba (6, 7, 3)G\u03ba\u03b3 (7, 5).77\n+\n\u03b4G\u03b3\u03b7 (4, 5)\n\n(5)\n\nHere, \u03c3 i , i=x,y,z, are the Pauli spin matrices and \u03c3 0\nis defined to be a 2x2 unit matrix. Capital letter indices\nrun over 0,x,y,z, while Greek letters take the values \u00b11.\nWe use the following common shorthand notation: (x\u03c4 )\nis represented by a number, repeated indices are summed\nand repeated variables represented by numbers are integrated, unless they appear on both sides of the equation.\nFor clarity, we further adopt a notation that quantities\nwith subscript denoted by capital letter do not depend on\nspin. The spin-dependent interaction has been expanded\nin the Pauli and unit matrices as\nv\u03b1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b3 (1, 2) = \u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b7 vIJ (1, 2)\u03c3 J\u03ba\u03b3 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe spin-Hedin equations can e.g. be applied to Hamiltonians containing interactions of the following form.\n\uf8f1 0 0\n\u2032\n\uf8f2 \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b3 \u03c3 \u03b2\u03b7 /|r \u2212 r |,\n\u2032\ni\n\u2032 j\nv\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\u03b7 (r, r ) = \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b3 Jij (r, r )\u03c3 \u03b2\u03b7 ,\n\uf8f3 i\n\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b3 \u03bci (r, r\u2032 )\u03c3 0\u03b2\u03b7\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the first is the usual Coulomb interaction, the second a spin-spin interaction and the third a spin-orbit\ninteraction, which contains the angular momentum operator.\nThe general structure of the set of equations (2) \u2013 (5)\nis remarkably close to the usual Hedin's equations. However, the self-energy now depends on the spin variable,\nand the screened interaction W as well as the polarization\nfunction P acquire a matrix form expressing an interplay\nbetween the charge and spin channels. Thus, a polarization function P0i , for example, describes a charge density\nresponse of the system with respect to a perturbing magnetic field in the i-direction. When P is used in (3) the\ncharge channel of the screened interaction experiences\nthe effects of the spin interactions and vice versa.\nMost importantly, one can construct from these equations a spin-dependent generalization of Hedin's GWA,\nby approximating the vertex functions by\n\u039bI\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2, 3) = \u03b4(1 \u2212 2)\u03b4(2 \u2212 3)\u03c3 I\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nBefore proceeding further, let us interpret the meaning\nof the resulting polarization and the spin-dependent selfenergy. Consider first the case I = J = 0 (charge\nchannel) giving P00 (1, 2) = G\u03b1\u03b3 (1, 2)G\u03b3\u03b1 (2, 1+ ) and\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2) = \u2212G\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2)W00 (2, 1). If the Green function\nis diagonal in spin space we recover the polarization and\nthe self-energy in the original Hedin's equations. However, for a system with an existing spin structure, such\nas a non-colinear spin, the Green function possesses nondiagonal spin components. This case is a generalization of the original Hedin's equations to spin-dependent\nGreen's function and self-energy with purely Coulombic\ninteraction. It emerges naturally in the present formulation as a special case where spin interactions are absent.\nLet us now consider the case when the interaction is\nspin dependent, which may arise from purely spin-spin\ninteraction or spin-orbit coupling, among other possibilities. The exchange-correlation effects on the Green function of up spin is illustrated in Fig. 1 (lower panel). A\n0\nparticle of up spin G\u2191\u2191\nenters the self-energy \u03a3\u2191\u2191 . Upon\nentering the self-energy the electron spin is flipped to\ndown spin by a spin operator \u03c3 i\u2191\u2193 and a magnon represented by Wij is emitted. Upon leaving the self-energy\nthe spin operator \u03c3 j\u2193\u2191 causes the electron to reabsorb the\nmagnon and return to its original up spin configuration.\nThis process is analogous to the original Hedin's GWA\nwhereby an electron emits and absorbs a plasmon but\nwithout the possibility of spin flip (upper panel).\nThe derivation of the generalized Hedin's equations\nclosely follows Hedin's original work, using Schwinger's\nfunctional derivative technique. Since many problems related to spin degrees of freedom involves temperature, we\nwork in the finite-temperature formalism but of course\nthe zero-temperature version readily follows.

For\nexample, if we consider an Ising interaction and choose a\nstarting Green's function corresponding to the mean-field\nsolution, solving the magnetic Hedin's equations iteratively will not generate other spin configurations because\nthere is no spin-flip term in the Ising model. More explicitly, the polarization in (9) with the mean-field Green's\nfunction will only possess the z-component Pzz , which in\nturns will only generate Wzz . Thus, the self-energy in\n(10) will not have off-diagonal components in spin space\nthat would allow for spin-flip processes yielding spin configurations other than the mean-field one. To solve this\nproblem, one must start with a starting Green's function\nthat corresponds to a multi configuration. This problem does not arise in the general spin spiral case, where\nthe spin at each point may have different magnitude and\ndirection. The non-interacting Green's function [8]\n\n\u03b4V H (1) \u03b4\u03c1M (3) \u03b4\u03a6K (4)\n+ I\n\u03b4\u03c1M (3) \u03b4\u03a6K (4) \u03b4\u03c6J (2)\n\n= \u03b4(1 \u2212 2)\u03b4 IJ + vIM (1, 3)PMK (3, 4)\u03b5\u22121\nKJ (4, 2)\n(28)\nand multiplying by the bare interaction, we obtain Eq.\n(3). The response function, R = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03b4\u03c6, satisfies a similar\nequation:\nRIJ (1, 2) = PIJ (1, 2) + PIK (1, 3)vKL (3, 4)RKJ (4, 2)\n(29)\nwhich follows from \u03b4\u03c1/\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03b4\u03a6 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03a6/\u03b4\u03c6 = P \u03b5\u22121 .\nThe above three equations for \u03b5\u22121 , W , and R are equivalent. This concludes our derivation of the spin-dependent\nHedin's equations.\nIn the following we first comment on some practical aspects of the generalized GWA; we then conclude by discussing possible applications and further developments.\nWe note that while the magnetic Hedin's equations\nare exact, the solution depends crucially on the starting\n\n\u03a3GW\n\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2) = \u2212G\u03b1\u03b2 (1, 2)W00 (2, 1).\n\n(32)\n\nUsing the self-energy one solves the quasiparticle equation\n\u0012 0\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh + \u03a3GW\n\u03a3GW\n\u03c8 n\u2191\n\u03c8 n\u2191\n\u2191\u2191 (En )\n\u2191\u2193 (En )\n=\nE\nn\n\u03a3GW\nh0 + \u03a3GW\n\u03c8 n\u2193\n\u03c8 n\u2193\n\u2193\u2191 (En )\n\u2193\u2193 (En )\n(33)\nwhich contains the effects of the non-diagonal spin components of the self-energy.\nA non-interacting Green's function constructed from a\nHamiltonian containing a spin-orbit interaction will also\nhave non-diagonal spin components. A similar formulation as above can be applied to this situation. The\nscreened interaction will contain charge-spin coupling\ncomponents and the self-energy will take a more general\nform as given in (10). Correlation effects on orbital moments and spin densities can then be accessed including\nlife-time effects.\nIn conclusion, we have derived the spin-dependent generalization of the original set of Hedin's equations. Their\nfirst order term (in the spin-dependent screened interaction) leads to a spin-dependent GW approximation.\nThese equations allow for a truly first-principles study\n\n\f5\nof a wide range of problems where correlation effects induced by spin interactions play a crucial role in determining physical properties. Applications to nanoscale magnetic systems ranging from quantum dots, quantum wires\nto impurities or nanoparticles, as well as to films, surface\nand interface problems now come into reach [9, 10]. Also,\ndevelopments at the interface of many-body perturbation\ntheory and time-dependent density functional theory as\nproposed in [11, 12] are readily generalized e.g. to relativistic interactions. The same is true for combined GW\nand dynamical mean field techniques [13].\n\n[1] W. Kohn, Rev. Mod. Phys. 71, 1253 (1999).\n[2] L. Hedin, Phys. Rev. 139, A796 (1965); L. Hedin and\nS.
