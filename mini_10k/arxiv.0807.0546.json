The current hot debates on the origin of exotic phenomena\nand ground states in magnetic spinels concern, e.g.,\nthe Verwey transition in Fe3 O4 1,2 , heavy-fermion formation in LiV2 O4 3,4 , colossal magnetoresistance in Cu\ndoped FeCr2 S4 5,6 , gigantic Kerr rotation7 and the orbital glass state in FeCr2 S4 8 , the spin-orbital liquid\nin FeSc2 S4 9 , the colossal magneto-capacitive effect in\nCdCr2 S4 and HgCr2 S4 10,11 , the negative thermal expansion and strong spin-phonon coupling in ZnCr2 Se4 and\nZnCr2 S4 12,13,14 , the spin dimerization in CuIr2 S4 15 and\nMgTi2 O4 16 , and the spin-Peierls-like transitions in 3dimensional solids17,18,19 . The appearance of these fascinating ground states is attributed to the competition\nof charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which are\nstrongly coupled to the lattice.\nAdditional complexity in the normal AB 2 X 4 spinels\narises from the frustration effects related to the topological constrains of the pyrochlore lattice of corner-sharing\ntetrahedra of the B -site magnetic ions. In this geometry the exchange interaction alone cannot select a unique\nground state. As a result, the magnetic system remains\nin the disordered state down to temperatures much lower\nthan the scale provided by the exchange interaction. In\nZnCr2 O4 strong direct antiferromagnetic Cr-Cr exchange\nis manifested by the Curie-Weiss temperature of about\n\u2212400 K, while magnetic order appears only below 12 K\nvia a first-order phase transition. At this transition the\naforementioned degeneracy is lifted by a structural deformation, which is reported to be tetragonal.17\nNeutron-scattering experiments have proven that noncollinear commensurate antiferromagnetic order is established below the transition temperature. However, the\ndetails of the magnetic structure are still under heavy\ndebate. It was speculated that a multi-k structure is\n\nformed.20,21 Moreover, sample dependent intensities of\nthe magnetic reflections suggest that ZnCr2 O4 is critically located close to several spin structures20 .\nIn the present paper we report results of a magnetic\nresonance study in the ordered phase of ZnCr2 O4 . Earlier ESR studies22 concentrated on the paramagnetic\nstate above TN and did not report any resonance absorption signals below TN . We find several gapped resonance modes, spin-reorientation transitions, and evidences for an orthorhombic structural deformation. We\nobserve magnetic resonance signals originating from different structural domains. We demonstrate that these\ndomains can be effectively aligned by field cooling in a\nmoderate magnetic field. The low-energy dynamics can\nbe described qualitatively within the exchange-symmetry\ntheory, indicating that magnetic order in ZnCr2 O4 is governed by a single order parameter.\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nZnCr2 O4 single crystals were grown by chemical transport reactions from polycrystalline starting material prepared by solid-state reactions of stoichiometric binary\nzinc and chromium oxides of 99.99% purity. Perfect single crystalline samples of octahedral shape and dimensions up to 3 mm on the edge were obtained. X-ray\ndiffraction at room temperature revealed a single-phase\nmaterial with the cubic spinel structure with a lattice\nconstant a = 8.332(1) \u00c5 and an oxygen fractional coordinate x = 0.263(1). The magnetic properties were studied using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum\nDesign MPMS-5) working at fields up to 50 kOe.\nMagnetic resonance measurements in the wide frequency range from 20 to 150 GHz were performed at\nthe Kapitza Institute.

Magnetic resonance\nabsorption spectra were recorded at different frequencies for three principal orientations of the magnetic field:\nH||h001i, h110i, h111i. The measurements were mostly\ndone on zero-field cooled samples, the effect of field cooling was checked at certain frequencies.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.\n\nFigure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetic susceptibility of ZnCr2 O4 single crystals for the\nmagnetic field applied along all three characteristic directions of the cubic system. The susceptibility is isotropic\nabove the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature TN = 12.5 K. At high temperatures the susceptibility follows a Curie-Weiss law, but deviates already at\nabout 100 K and develops a broad maximum around 50\nK indicative for short-range AFM correlations. At TN\n\none observes a discontinuous change of the data typical\nfor a first-order transition. In the magnetically ordered\nregime the magnetic susceptibility of the zero-field-cooled\n(ZFC) sample shows a pronounced anisotropy with the\nhighest value for measurements along the h001i direction\n(for the measurements in the field of 10 kOe).\nTo investigate the anisotropy in more detail, the magnetization was measured dependent on the magnetic field\nboth for zero-field cooling (ZFC) as well as after fieldcooling (FC) in 50 kOe. As shown in Fig. 2, the ZFC\ndata manifest a non-linear behavior in small fields (up\nto 20 kOe) and a linear increase of the magnetization for\nhigher fields. For H||h100i the M/H curve shows a linear\nincrease indicating smooth rotation of the magnetization,\nwhile for the two other directions strong non-linearities\nare observed around 15 kOe, as typical for a spin-flop.\nField cooling has only a weak effect for H||h001i, but\nleads to nearly constant M/H for the other two orientations. In the field cooled sample the largest value of\nmagnetic susceptibility is observed for H||h110i.\nThe evolution of the resonance-absorption spectrum\nwith temperature is shown in Figure 3. At high temperatures (in the paramagnetic phase) a single absorption\ncomponent with a g-factor close to 2.0 is observed. The\ntransition to the antiferromagnetically ordered state is\nclearly marked by the discontinuous transformation of\nthe resonance absorption spectrum: below the N\u00e9el temperature TN the absorption spectrum consists of several\ncomponents strongly shifted from the paramagnetic resonance position. No hysteresis exceeding the resolution\nlimit of 0.1 K was detected at the transition. On cooling below TN the resonance lines first show a pronounced\nshift, but below 5 K the temperature dependence of the\nresonance positions is negligible.\nThe shape of the resonance absorption spectra is\nstrongly affected by field cooling. Figure 4 compares the\nresonance absorption measured on ZFC and FC samples.\nHere field cooling was performed at the field of 50 kOe\n\n\f3\n\nH || <001>, f = 138 GHz\nFC\nZFC\nH || <110>, 44 GHz\n\nTransmission (arb. units)\n\nZFC\n\nFC\n\nH || <111>, 36 GHz\n\nESR signal (arb. units)\n\nFC\nZFC\n\nZnCr2O4\n0\n\n20\n\n9.4 GHz, H || <110>\n\nZFC\n\nO2\n\nto the finest details. However, at 8 K (which is still below TN ) keeping the H||h110i-oriented sample at 18 kOe\nfor 90 minutes leads to 30% reduction of the observed\nresonance absorption.\nThe entire frequency-field diagrams for the different\norientations of the magnetic field are given in Figure 5.\nThese dependences demonstrate the presence of several\nresonance modes with zero-field gaps of 21 \u00b1 2 GHz and\n113 \u00b1 2 GHz. For H||h110i and h111i one of the resonance modes softens in the magnetic field between 10\nand 15 kOe. Note that the nonlinearity of the magnetization curves is also observed at H = 10 . . . 15 kOe for these\ndirections (Figure 2). Field cooling reduces the number\nof the observed resonance modes to two: one for each of\nthe zero-field gaps.\n\nFC\n\nIV.\nH || <-110>\nafter\nFC || <110>\n\n5\n\nA.\n\nPhase transition, domains, field cooling\n\nT = 4.2 K\n\n10\n\nH (kOe)\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\n40\n\n15\n\n60\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Comparison of the resonance absorption observed at 1.8 K in zero-field cooled (ZFC) and fieldcooled (FC) samples for different orientations of the magnetic\nfield. Inset: Field cooling effect on the AFM soft mode at\nT = 4.2 K and f = 9.4 GHz. After FC only the background\nsignal remains due to frozen oxygen).\n\nstarting from 20 K. For H||h110i and h111i field cooling\nleads to the disappearance of some of the absorption components. The remaining absorption components are usually slightly shifted from the corresponding absorption\ncomponent measured on the ZFC sample. The vanishing absorption intensity does not necessarily add to the\nremaining components: for example, for H||h110i the intensity of the remaining component after field cooling is\nthe same as for the ZFC sample. For H||h001i field cooling effects are less evident - all absorption components\nare observed in FC samples, field cooling leads only to a\nslight change of the absorption intensity.\nActually, application of a field of 50 kOe during the\ncooling seems to be excessive. It is enough to cool the\nsample at the moderate field of 18 kOe to suppress some\nof the resonance modes as can be seen in the inset of\nFigure 4. Especially, the soft modes indicative for spinreorientation, disappear after field cooling but reappear\nas the sample is rotated to another crystallographically\nequivalent position. Note that the nonlinearity of the\nmagnetization curves vanishes after field cooling as well.\nThe stability of the ZFC resonance absorption under prolonged exposure to the magnetic field below TN was also\nchecked by the high-sensitive X-band measurements. At\n4 K the shape of the resonance absorption is reproducible\n\nAs documented above, the change of the resonance\nfield at the phase transition is discontinuous. In conventional molecular field approximation, the shift of the antiferromagnetic resonance field with respect to the paramagnetic resonance is proportional to the magnitude of\nthe order parameter, i.e., to the sublattice magnetization. The discontinuous change of the resonance field at\nthe phase transition indicates that the order parameter\nis not small even just below the transition temperature.\nThis observation is in agreement with the first-order nature of the phase transition in ZnCr2 O4 .17,24\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic phase\nis isotropic due to its cubic symmetry. Cubic symmetry is lost in the ordered state because of the lattice deformation. The lattice-strain direction can take one of\nthe equivalent crystallographic axes. The susceptibility\ntensor of the antiferromagnet is anisotropic, the orientation of its principal axes is determined by the orientation\nof the order parameter fixed by anisotropic interactions\nwith respect to the crystallographic axes. Therefore, the\nsusceptibility tensors of different structural domains are\noriented differently and the gain in the Zeeman energy\nis different for different domains. Thus, the application\nof magnetic field makes one of the domains more favorable. It provides an obvious mechanism for the observed\nfield-cooling effect and for the instability of the resonance\nabsorption close to TN , described in the previous section.\nThis assumption is in agreement with the increase of the\nmagnetic susceptibility in the field-cooled sample (Figure\n2).\nThe formation of the domain structure in the case of a\ncubic-to-tetragonal lattice transition is well studied for\nferroelastic systems. A complicated domain structure\nconsisting of thin twinned domains is usually formed in\nferroelastics (see, for example, recent Refs. 25,26). Twinning allows to avoid strong local strain at the contact of\nthe domains with different directions of deformation axes.\n\n\f4\nThe thickness of twin domains observed in the doped ferroelastic HTSC compound YBa2 Cu3 O7 is about 10-100\nnm.26 Twinning also leads to a slight tilting (of the order of \u2206a/a) of the domain axes from the corresponding crystallographic axes of the high-temperature phase.\nWhile the axes tilting is too small (\u2206a/a \u223c 10\u22123 ) to\nbe of importance, small domain thickness could result in\nexcitation of standing spin-waves with k \u223c 1/L (L is a\ndomain thickness) instead of a uniform k = 0 oscillation.\nThis size effect can be a possible reason for the slight shift\nof the resonance absorption position in the FC sample.\nThis allows to estimate the thickness of the crystallographic domains. We assume a quadratic spectrum of\nantiferromagnetic spin-waves\nq\nE = \u220620 + \u03b12 k 2\n(1)\nhere \u03b1 \u223c Ja. J denotes the exchange coupling constant between nearest-neighbour spins at distance a. If\n\u03b1k \u226a \u22060 , the effective zero-field gap for the standing\nspin-waves is larger than for the uniform oscillation by\n\u03b4 = \u03b12 k 2 /(2\u22060 ). Consequently, the resonance branches\nof the monodomain (FC) sample should be shifted downwards (on the H-f plane) by \u03b4 with respect to the resonance branches of the multidomain (ZFC) sample: i.e.\nfor the branches rising with the field the remaining absorption component of the FC sample shifts at the given\nfrequency to higher fields with respect to its position in\nthe case of the ZFC sample. This slight shift is observed\nin the experiment (Figure 4), its magnitude does not exceed the half-width of the absorption line. We estimate\n\u03b4/h as 1 GHz (h is the Planck constant). Then, the domain thickness can be estimated as\nJ\nL\n\u223c \u221a\na\n\u22060 \u03b4\n\n(2)\n\nwhich yields (substituting J = 20 K,27 \u22060 /h=20 GHz, )\nL/a \u223c 100 \u226b 1.\nIn further discussion we assume that the domains are\nthick enough to be considered as bulk antiferromagnet,\nand that the domain walls do not contribute to the magnetic resonance absorption.\n\nB.\n\nApplication of the exchange-symmetry theory\n\nWe use the theory of exchange symmetry23 to analyze\nthe experimental results. According to this theory, if the\nrelativistic effects are much smaller than the exchange\ninteraction, the order parameter can be represented by\nat most 3 unitary orthogonal vectors which transform\nby irreducible representations of the crystal symmetry\ngroup. The number of vectors and these representations\ndefine the exchange symmetry of the magnet. This approach allows to describe all symmetry-based properties\nof a magnet without considering its detailed microscopic\nstructure or any model assumption. For the case of a\n\nnoncollinear antiferromagnet the order parameter consists of at least two vectors. In case of only two vectors\nfor the sake of simplicity we denote l(3) = [l(1) \u00d7 l(2) ].\nWe derive the dynamic equations for homogeneous oscillations from the Lagrange function\nL=\n\nX Ii \u0010\ni\n\n2\n\nl\u0307(i) + \u03b3[l(i) \u00d7 H]\n\n\u00112\n\n\u2212 Ua ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the free electron,\nthe constants Ii are related to the eigenvalues of the susceptibility tensor, and the term Ua includes small relativistic corrections to the main exchange part due to\nspin-orbital and dipole-dipole effects. These corrections\ncan be expanded by the components of the order parameter. The first order of the Ua expansion is quadratic\n(j)\non li . The second order terms can be omitted, because\nthey are \u03b12 times smaller, where \u03b1 is the fine-structure\nconstant. The Lagrange function must be invariant under all transformations of the crystallographic symmetry\ngroup, which results in some relations between the coefficients in Ua expansion. These relations vary for different\nexchange-symmetry groups.\nThe dynamic equations are obtained by taking a variational derivative of the Lagrangian (3) over the rotations\nof the spin space. These equations should be linearized\nnear the equilibrium position to obtain the eigenfrequencies of small oscillations. In general case, if the magnetic\nfield direction deviates from the eigenvector of the susceptibility tensor, the equilibrium positions cannot be determined analytically. To model the observed frequencyfield dependences, we perform numerical calculations of\nthe oscillation eigenfrequencies. We use standard minimization routines to find an equilibrium orientation of\nthe order parameter. This modeling procedure is combined with a fitting algorithm using the constants Ii and\nthe coefficients of the Ua expansion as fit parameters.\nWhen performing the expansion of the relativistic corrections, it is necessary to take into account that in the\ncase of ZnCr2 O4 the magnetic unit cell is larger than the\ncrystallographic one21,28 . Therefore some components of\nthe order parameter are not invariant under some of the\ntranslational elements of the crystallographic symmetry\n9\ngroup. Since the crystal-symmetry group D2d\n, suggested\nin Ref. 21, has a point symmetry D2d in the vertex of the\ncrystallographic cell, we will focus primarily on the pointsymmetry subgroup. Note that this special property re9\nmains for all subgroups of D2d\n. Thus, on discussing the\nlowering of the lattice symmetry below TN to D27 , we will\nfocus primarily on the point-symmetry subgroup.\nAlthough some representations of D2d allow weak ferromagnetism, the susceptibility measurements do not reveal any spontaneous magnetization. This can be either\ndue to the spontaneous magnetization being too small,\nor, more likely, there is no weak ferromagnetism for the\nexchange group in the present case. Therefore, we will\nnot take weak ferromagnetism into account in further\ndiscussion.\n\n\f5\nC.\n\nEvidence for orthorhombic distortions below TN\n\nHere we will demonstrate that the assumption of the\ntetragonal lattice symmetry in the ordered phase contradicts the experimental observation described in the\nprevious section and the explanation of the experimental findings requires a further reduction to orthorhombic\nsymmetry.\nFirst, we note that the symmetry of the magnetic\nstructure below Tc is lower than tetragonal. This statement follows directly from the observation of the distinct\nfield-cooling effect for H||h111i, since this field orientation is equivalent for all tetragonal domains.\nFor the tetragonal lattice deformation only three types\nof different crystallographic domains, differing by the direction of the tetragonal axis z (z||h001i, h010i, h001i),\ncan be formed at the transition. Since the magnetic symmetry of the ordered phase is lower than the lattice symmetry, two types of magnetic domains with different x\nand y axes can be formed in each crystallographic domain. Here and further on in this paper we will denote\nby x and y the directions of the two-fold axes perpendicular to the z axis (S4 axis for the D2d symmetry). Note\nthat the reduction of the point symmetry from Oh to D2d\ncould be done in two ways: (i) by removal of the [100]\nand [010] symmetry axes as well as (110) and (1 \u2212 10)\nmirror planes; (ii) by removal of the [110] and [1 \u2212 10]\nsymmetry axes as well as (100) and (010) mirror planes\nwith the former four-fold axes h100i and h010i becoming\ntwo-fold axes. In the second choice of axes the magnetic\nfield aligned along the h111i direction would be equivalent for all domains and there would be no reason for\nthe observed field-cooling effects. Thus, the first possibility has to be realized. (Identification21 of the tetragonal\nphase as I4m2 also points to the first possibility.) Therefore, x and y axes are aligned along the diagonals of the\ncubic facets.\nNow all domains can be classified by the orientation of\ntheir \"xyz\" basis with respect to the cubic axes of the\nparamagnetic phase as shown in Table I. Some of these\ndomains appear to be equivalent in the particular experimental conditions (here x, y, z are the unit vectors in the\ncorresponding directions, trivial cases are combined):\n\nTABLE I: Classification of the AFM domains with respect to\nthe cubic axes of the paramagnetic phase\ndomain\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n\nx\n[110]\n[1-10]\n[101]\n[-101]\n[011]\n[01-1]\n\ny\n[-110]\n[110]\n[10-1]\n[101]\n[0-11]\n[011]\n\nz\n[001]\n[001]\n[010]\n[010]\n[100]\n[100]\n\nH||[100]\ndomains (e),(f): H||z\ndomains (a), (b), (c), (d): H||x + y\nH||[110]\ndomain (a): H||x\ndomain (b): H||y\n\u221a +z\ndomains (c),(f), (d), (e): H|| x+y\n2\n\nH||[111]\n\u221a\ndomains (a),(c),(e): H|| 2x + z\n\u221a\ndomains (b),(d),(f): H|| 2y + z\nNote that for the H||h111i field orientation there are\nonly two types of different magnetic domains. As one\ncan see from the experimental data in Figure 5 we observe five resonance branches in this orientation: two\noriginating from the higher gap, two originating from the\nlower gap and one in the high-field-low-frequency part\nof the frequency-field diagram. The observation of this\nfifth branch indicates the existence of a third zero-field\ngap which is not observed directly and is less or equal in\nmagnitude than the lowest observed gap of 21 GHz.\nTo apply the exchange-symmetry theory as described\nin the previous subsection it is necessary to specify the\nsymmetry of the order parameter. The point symmetry\ngroup D2d has two-dimensional and one-dimensional irreducible representations. If l(1) and l(2) transform by\na two-dimensional representation, then I1 = I2 and the\nrelativistic contribution to the Lagrangian (3) has the\nform\n\nUa\n\n\u0012\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u00112 \u0013\n2\n1\n(1)\n= A\n+ B lx(1) ly(2) + ly(1) lx(2) +\n+ ly(2)\nlx\n2\n\u0011 1 \u0010 \u00112\n\u0010\n(4)\n+C lx(1) ly(2) \u2212 ly(1) lx(2) + D lz(3)\n2\n\nIf l(1) and l(2) transform differently under translations,\nthen B = C = 0. In the other fundamental case, if l(1)\nand l(2) transform by one-dimensional representations,\nthe relativistic contribution reads\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u00112 1 \u0010 \u00112\nUa = A lz(1) + B lz(2) + C lx(1) ly(2) \u2212 ly(1) lx(2) (5)\n2\n2\nor\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 \u0010 \u00112 1 \u0010 \u00112\nUa = A lz(1) + B lz(2) + C lx(1) ly(2) + ly(1) lx(2) (6)\n2\n2\nDepending on the coefficients of the Ua expansion,\nthere are two general possibilities: (i) the l(i) lie in the\n(xz) and (yz) planes; (ii) the l(i) lie in the planes including the z axis and the bisector of the (xy) plane (i.e.\nin the D2d group mirror planes). ZnCr2 O4 corresponds\n\n\f6\nto the first case, since in the second case for H||h111i\nthe order parameter vectors l(1) , l(2) , l(3) in all magnetic\ndomains form the same angles with the field direction,\nwhich should result in the absence of the field cooling\neffects.\nWe tried to fit the experimentally observed frequencyfield dependences applying the exchange-symmetry theory as described above. However, we did not reach any\nreasonable agreement of the modeled curves with the experiment. The reason of this disagreement can be explained qualitatively. Namely, it can be proven (see\nAppendix) that for the tetragonal D2d point symmetry the domain manifesting a spin reorientation transition becomes indistinguishable from the other domains\nabove the transition field. This is due to the fact that\neven for a magnetic symmetry lower than tetragonal, the\nanisotropic contribution Ua reflects the tetragonal crystal symmetry. Thus, after the spin reorientation transition the reoriented domain appears to be in a state\nwith the Zeeman energy lower than before reorientation,\nbut with the same value of the anisotropic term Ua . The\nequivalence of the magnetic domains above the transition\nshould provide the same magnetic resonance frequencies\nabove the spin-flop transition. Moreover, there would be\nno reason for these domains to split again as the magnetic field is reduced to zero. This, however, contradicts\nthe experimental observation of the specific resonance\nmodes corresponding to the domain undergoing a spinreorientation above the spin-flop field, as well as to the\nreproducibility of the low-field domain structure.\nThe problem can be solved by the assumption that\nthe lattice deformation at Tc involves not only a compression along the c-direction, but also a weak in-plane\ndeformation leading to further reduction of the symmetry. There are two options: to exclude mirror planes\n(which yields D2 point symmetry) or to exclude secondorder axes (C2v ). As we have shown above, the components of the order parameter lie in the (xz) and (yz)\nplanes. This limits our choice to D2 point symmetry\n9\n(the corresponding space subgroup of D2d\nis D27 (F 222))\nwith second-order axes along h001i directions (z), and\nalong h110i directions (x and y). This assumption provides inequivalent crystallographic domains differing by\nthe x and y directions. These orthorhombic distortions\nwere not detected in the earlier structural studies17,21 ,\nmost likely because they are probably smaller than the\nexperimental resolution.\n\nD. Modeling of the AFM resonance frequency-field\ndependences for the case of orthorhombic distortions\n\nWe modeled the antiferromagnetic resonance\nfrequency-field dependences assuming orthorhombic\ndistortions below TN . As was explained above, to write\ndown the expansion of Ua we again will focus on the\npoint-symmetry group. The D2 symmetry group has\nfour one-dimensional representations. There are only\n\nfour fundamentally different cases, the others can be\nreduced to them by renaming the axes x, y or vectors\nl(1) , l(2) :\n\nUa =\n\nUa =\n\nUa =\n\nUa =\n\nA \u0010 (1) \u00112 B \u0010 (2) \u00112 C \u0010 (1) \u00112 D \u0010 (2) \u00112\n+\n+\n+\n+\nl\nl\nl\nl\n2 \u0010z\n2 z \u0011 2\u0010 x\n2 x\u0011\n+E lx(1) ly(2) \u2212 ly(1) lx(2) + F lx(1) ly(2) + ly(1) lx(2) (7)\nA \u0010 (1) \u00112 B \u0010 (2) \u00112 C \u0010 (1) \u00112 D \u0010 (2) \u00112\n+\n+\n+\n+\nl\nl\nl\nl\n2 \u0010z\n2 z \u0011 2\u0010 x\n2 x\u0011\n+E ly(1) lz(2) \u2212 lz(1) ly(2) + F ly(1) lz(2) + lz(1) ly(2) (8)\nA \u0010 (1) \u00112 B \u0010 (2) \u00112 C \u0010 (1) \u00112 D \u0010 (2) \u00112\nl\nl\nl\nl\n+\n+\n+\n+\n2 z\n2 z\n2 x\n2 x\n+Elz(1) lz(2) + F lx(1) lx(2)\n(9)\nA \u0010 (1) \u00112 B \u0010 (2) \u00112 C \u0010 (1) \u00112 D \u0010 (2) \u00112\n+\n+\n+\n(10)\nl\nl\nl\nl\n2 z\n2 z\n2 x\n2 x\n\nHere we again exclude weak ferromagnetism from the\nconsideration. The first three cases are feasible only if l(1)\nand l(2) transform in the same way under translations.\nThe third case is feasible if l(1) and l(2) transform by the\nsame one-dimensional irreducible representation.\nThe low symmetry of the ordered state results in too\nmany free parameters in the equations of spin dynamics (four to six coefficients in the Ua expansion and two\nof the three Ii constants). By fixing the zero-field gaps\nof the AFM resonance spectrum we can put only three\nconstraints on these parameters. Other constraints are\nexpected to appear during the fitting of the modeled\nAFM resonance spectra. This involves too many degrees\nof freedom for the assumptions on the sort of equilibrium position, the way the spin-flop transition takes, and\nthe correspondence between structural domains and resonance branches. An unequivocal quantitative reproduction of the experimental curves was difficult to achieve,\nhowever, a reasonable agreement with the experimentally\nobserved AFM resonance spectra was obtained for different sets of parameters and for the different forms of Ua .\nHere we present the results of modeling the case of Ua\ntaken in the form (8). From Figure 5 one can see that the\ncorrespondence of model and experiment is fairly good.\nThe correct quantity of resonance branches is obtained.\nThe values of the zero-field gaps are in good agreement\nwith the experimental data. For orientations H||h110i\nand h111i the spin-reorientation transitions of certain domains are well reproduced.\nOur modeling indicates that the frequency-field dependences can be reasonably reproduced assuming a single\ntype of order parameter and taking into account all possible domains.

These discrepancies can be due to the following reasons: at 9 GHz\nESR experiments, fields up to only 18 kOe were available,\nwhereas above 18 GHz the frequency-field dependences\n\nFIG. 6: (color online). Upper frame: Calculated field dependences of the energy difference for various domains. The\ncalculations are done for the same parameters as used for the\nAFM resonance spectrum shown in Figure 5. Middle frame:\nCalculated magnetization of the domains with unfavorable\norientation. Inset: Calculated field dependences of the Euler\nangles for the H||h110i y-domain. Lower frame: Calculated\nmagnetization of the domains with favorable orientation of\nthe order parameter.\n\nof the low-frequency modes in question are rather flat. In\nthe case of I2 = I3 they become field independent which\nresults in a strong broadening of the resonance modes in\nthe experiments at fixed frequency. Thus, these modes\ncannot be detected in a field scan. Concerning the discrepancy for the H||x domain, note that the modeled\ncurves still demonstrate an \"anti-crossing\" which can be\nenhanced, for example, by higher order terms in the energy expansion.\nOur modelling demonstrates that the spinreorientation transition can be realized by a continuous\n\n\f8\nrotation of the order parameter as shown e.g. for the\ny domain in the inset of Fig. 6. This explains the\nabsence of a sharp change of the magnetization at\nthe spin-reorientation transition which is simulated in\nthe middle and lower frames of this figure. The field\ndependence of the magnetization is qualitatively well\nreproduced: it demonstrates a nonlinear behavior with\na characteristic change during the spin-reorientation\nfor the unfavorable domains, which would disappear\nafter field cooling, and an almost linear behavior for\nthe favorable domains which remains after field cooling.\nThe energy difference between different domains shown\nin the upper frame of this figure explains the observed\nfield-cooling phenomena. The domains corresponding to\nthe modes surviving the field cooling have the lowest energy in the magnetic field. For the orientation H||h111i\nthe calculated energy difference between the domains is\nsimilar and, thus, the field-cooling effect is comparable\nto the case H||h110i. For H||h001i this difference is much\nsmaller which can probably explain the much weaker\nfield-cooling effect for this direction. However we have\nto admit the problem in reproducing the experimentally\nobserved anisotropy of the field-cooled magnetization\nat low fields: the experimentally highest susceptibility\nfor the monodomain FC sample is observed for H||h110i\n(Figure 2), while the modelled curves for the presented\nparameter set indicate a slightly higher susceptibility for\nthe most favorable domain in the H||h100i (Figure 6).\nNote that the modeled difference of the three favorable\ndomains is tiny, thus for low fields some weak effects\nrelated to shape anisotropy or surface effect may distroy\nthe stability of the uniform magnetization.\nSummarizing the results of our modeling, we conclude\nthat the low-energy dynamics of the ordered phase of\nZnCr2 O4 can be described by the assumption of a single\ntype of magnetic order below TN . This puts a question\nmark on the possibility to realize different spin structures\nin ZnCr2 O4 as suggested earlier20. We suppose that the\ncomplications in the determination of the magnetic structure of ZnCr2 O4 by neutron scattering were caused by\nthe unaccounted orthorhombic deformations and effects\nof multiple domains.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have performed a detailed study of the low-energy\ndynamics of the ordered phase of the frustrated antiferromagnetic spinel ZnCr2 O4 . We have proven directly\nthat multiple domains exist below the transition temperature TN . We have demonstrated that some of these\ndomains are effectively suppressed by field cooling. Spinreorientation transitions indicated by softening of certain\nantiferromagnetic resonance modes and by the nonlinear\nbehavior of the magnetization are observed.\nThese results are incompatible with the earlier proposed symmetry of the distorted lattice. Thus, we conclude that the lattice deformation at the phase transition\n\ninvolves small in-plane distortions besides the tetragonal\ndistortions. We suggest that the actual symmetry of the\nlattice below TN corresponds to the orthorhombic D27\nsymmetry.\nWe have demonstrated that the low-energy dynamics can be reasonably described within the framework of\nthe exchange-symmetry theory, assuming a noncollinear\nmagnetic ordering characterized by a single order parameter.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAuthors thank A.I.

Minimizing\nthe energy (4) we get the orientation of the order parameter in the absence of magnetic field. For |B| > |A| the\nsolution consists vectors lying in the mirror planes, which\nis not the case of ZnCr2 O4 (see above). For |A| > |B|\nand A < 0 the two solutions are l(1) ||x, l(2) lying in the\n(yz) plane and l(2) ||y, l(1) lying in the (xz) plane. The\ncase of A > 0 can be reduced to this one by renaming the\naxes x and y. These solutions define two different magnetic domains. If the susceptibility along l(3) is less than\nalong l(1) and l(2) , then for H||x one of the domains is\nalready in its minimum of the Zeeman energy. The other\none is not in the minimum and at some value of magnetic\nfield it will undergo a spin-reorientation transition. As\nit turns out, there is only one possible state for it after\nthe transition, the same as for the first domain. So after\nthe spin-flop these two domains will be indistinguishable.\nIf the susceptibility along l(1) and l(2) is less than along\nl(3) , both domains are not in the minimum of the Zeeman\nenergy when the field is applied along the x axis. Still\nafter the spin-flop both domains again become indistinguishable.\nNow we consider case when l(1) and l(2) transform by\n\n\f9\none-dimensional representations of D2d . To define the\norientation of the order parameter we minimize the energy (5). We get the result that one of the vectors (let\nit be l(1) ) is aligned in the (xy) plane, but its orientation in this plane remains arbitrary. To find a solution,\nit is necessary to take into account the next order terms\nin the Ua expansion. There is no need to write down\nall of them, just note that due to the tetragonal symmetry the dependence of Ua on the angle \u03c6 between l(1)\nand x is F cos(4\u03c6). There are two sets of solutions depending on the sign of F. For F > 0 the solutions are\n\u03c6 = \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4, i.e. l(1) lies in the mirror\nplane, which is not the case of ZnCr2 O4 . For F < 0\nthe solutions are \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2. These solutions de-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nD. J. Huang, C. F. Chang, H.-T.

First, no matter along which l(i)\nthe susceptibility is largest, a spin-reorientation transition is expected for H||(x \u00b1 y) (i.e. H||h001i). This\nspin-reorientation is either rotation of the order parameter around the z axis by \u03c0/4 or, in the special case of\nthe largest susceptibility being along the z axis, rotation\nof the largest susceptibility direction to the (xy) plane.\nHowever, such a transition is not observed in our experiments. Second, the spin-flop transition observed at\nH||h111i can be caused only by rotation of the order parameter around the z axis, but after this rotation both\ndomains become indistinguishable.\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\nand A.
