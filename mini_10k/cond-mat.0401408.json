This model was introduced by Baxter1,2 and is known in the literature as the Zinvariant Ising model.\nRecently the Ising model on a certain class of planar lattices, those with isoradial embeddings as defined bellow, has attracted attention in connection with the concept of discrete\nholomorphy3,4,5 . Mercat3 conjectured a criticality condition and Kenyon6 showed that the\nrestricted model is solvable. In this paper we will prove the criticality conjecture and bring\nthese results into perspective by showing that the Ising model considered by these authors is\nthe restriction to the critical point of a Z-invariant Ising model. We will show that isoradial\nembeddings provide a geometrical interpretation of the Z-invariant Ising model which generalizes the model's geometrical solution2 in terms of angles characterizing straight rapidity\nlines.\nIn the seminal work of Baxter2 the Z-invariant Ising model is defined on planar graphs or\n'lattices' G, which are defined using an associated rapidity lattice Gs of planar intersecting\nstraight lines such that no three lines intersect at a point. These lattices Gs can be colored\nwith two colors in such a way that faces with different colors do not share edges. The Zinvariant Ising model is defined on the lattice G with vertices on one of the colored subset\nof faces and edges connecting neighboring same color faces which share a vertex, for an\nexample see of Fig. 1. The model coupling constants are determined by parameters, called\nthe rapidities, associated with the straight lines in Gs .\nIn this paper we will address the converse problem. Namely, given an arbitrary planar\nlattice G, defined without reference to a rapidity lattice, is it possible to assign coupling\nconstants to its edges in such a away that the Ising model on G is Z-invariant? This\nproblem has been considered previously in the context of quasi-crystals7,8 , by using either\nthe de Bruijn grid method9 or problem specific rapidity line choices10 . For general planar\nlattices we will show in Section III that a Z-invariant Ising model can be defined if and only\nif the lattice satisfies a certain topological property: that zig-zag paths on the lattice edges,\nthis is paths which alternately turn maximally left and right (see Fig. 2), do not intersect\neach other more than once or self-intersect. If this condition is satisfied a Z-invariant Ising\n2\n\n\fmodel can be defined using rapidity lines in one to one correspondence with the zig-zag\npaths.\nZig-zag paths are closely related to de Bruijn's9 concept of skeleton of a parallelogram\ntilling and have recently been used by Kenyon and Schlenker11 to discuss the existence of\nisoradial embeddings of planar lattices. A strictly convex isoradial embedding of a planar\nlattice is a particularly symmetric drawing of the lattice such that every vertex is at unit\ndistance from the center of the faces to which it belongs. For instance Fig. 3 would be an\nisoradial embedding of the lattice shown if drawn in such a way that all edges in dotted line\nhave equal unit length. These embeddings are particularly useful in the context of discrete\nholomorphy3,4,5 , where the isoradiality condition allows the definition of discrete analytic\nfunctions.\nThe intersection properties that we need to impose on the zig-zag paths of a planar\nlattice, to be able to define a Z-invariant Ising model, are equivalent11 to the existence of\nisoradial embeddings of that lattice. Therefore a Z-invariant Ising model can defined on a\nplanar lattice G if and only if G has isoradial embeddings.\nThis result can better understood by considering a geometric interpretation of the model.\nIn Section V we will show that a Z-invariant Ising model, with non-vanishing ferromagnetic\ncouplings, on a planar lattice defines an isoradial embedding of the lattice which is characterized by a set of geometric angles determined by the model's coupling constant at criticality.\nThis geometric interpretation is closely related with Baxter's geometric solution2 differing\nonly in the fact that the angles involved characterize the embedding of the lattice and not\nthe rapidity lines themselves, which need not to be embedded in the plane as straight lines.\nThe reverse statement is also true, given an isoradial embedding of a lattice one can always\ndefine a Z-invariant Ising model on that lattice using the geometric angles characterizing\nthe embedding and an elliptic function parameterization2 of the coupling constants. The\nIsing model on isoradial embeddings considered in references3,6 is the restriction to the\ncritical point of such a Z-invariant Ising model. Its critical point coupling constants Jijc can\nbe expressed in terms of the respective edge length Lij on the isoradial embedding of the\nlattice,\n2\n.\n(1)\nLij\nThis relation between coupling constants and geometry has been found previously in\ncosh 2Jijc =\n\nthe study of geometric properties of regular lattices at criticality, as effective angles of the\n3\n\n\fcorner magnetization12 and shape dependent modular parameters13,14,15,16 , suggesting that\nthe geometric interpretation reflects an important aspect of the Ising model critical behavior.\nThe paper is organized as follows:\nIn Section II we introduce the rapidity lattice G and the diamond lattice G\u2666 associated\nwith an arbitrary planar lattice G. In Sections III and IV the basic results of the Z-invariant\nIsing model are revisited in an embedding independent way. In Section V we discuss the\ngeometrical interpretation of the model. Finally in Section VI our conclusions are presented.\n\nII.\n\nTHE RAPIDITY LATTICE\n\nTo define the rapidity lattice G associated with a given planar lattice G it is convenient\nto first introduce the diamond lattice of G, denoted by G\u2666. The diamond lattice3 has as\nvertices the vertices of G and the vertices of the dual lattice G\u2217 and has edges connecting\neach vertex of G to the vertices of G\u2217 corresponding to its neighboring faces, an example\nis shown in Fig. 3. The faces of G\u2666 are quadrilateral and surround an edge of G and the\ncorresponding dual edge in G\u2217 .\nA zig-zag path on the edges of G, turning alternately maximally left and right, corresponds to a path of alternating diagonals on a sequence of quadrilateral faces of G\u2666 in which\neach face connects with its two neighboring faces by two opposite edges, see Fig. 3. To\neach zig-zag path we associate a rapidity line, defined as the path in the dual of G\u2666 which\nis contained by the corresponding sequence of faces. In the example of Fig. 3 three such\nrapidity lines are shown. Each edge of G has two associated rapidity lines in one to one\ncorrespondence with the two zig-zag paths which intersect at that edge.\nThe rapidity lattice G associated with the planar lattice G is formed by all the rapidity\nlines defined in this way. In general G is not embedded in the plane as a set of straight\nlines. The calligraphic type is a reminder that we are not interested in G as lattice or as an\nembedding of a lattice in the plane but as a set of intersecting curves each with an associated\nfree parameter, the respective rapidity. In section V a geometrical interpretation of this set\nwill be given, we will see that under mild restrictions the intersection pattern of G together\nwith its rapidities is a complete description of an isoradial embedding of G in the plane. An\nisoradial embedding of G, in which all its vertices are at unit length from the neighboring\nvertices of G\u2217 , corresponds to a rhombic embedding of G\u2666 in which all the lattice faces are\n4\n\n\frhombi of unit edge length.\n\nIII.\n\nZ-INVARIANCE\n\nGiven an arbitrary planar lattice G, the associated rapidity lattice G can always be\nconstructed using the procedure of the previous section. However a Z-invariant Ising model\ncan be defined on G only if the rapidity lines satisfy certain additional topological properties.\nIn this section we review the Z-invariant Ising model in an embedding independent way\nsuitable for the discussion of these properties.\nThe Ising model on an arbitrary planar lattice is defined in the usual way, by assigning a\nspin \u03c3i = \u00b11 to each vertex i and a coupling constant Jij to the edge connecting the vertices\ni and j. The model partition function is defined as\nZ=\n\nX\n\nX\n\nexp\n\nJij \u03c3i \u03c3j .\n\n<ij>\n\n[\u03c3]\n\n!\n\n(2)\n\nThe model is said to be Z-invariant2 if a star-triangle deformation of the lattice, as shown\nin Fig. 4, changes the partition function only by a multiplicative constant Zstar = R Ztriangle\nwith R being determined by the local coupling constants.\nZ-invariance places stringent conditions on the model coupling constants which can however be solved17 by introducing a parameterization in terms of elliptic functions of modulus\nk with 0 < k < 1. Following reference2 the coupling constants are parameterized in terms\nof an edge dependent argument Jij = J(\u03c4ij ) accordingly with table I, by choosing a regime\nand a modulus k. The corresponding Ising model is Z-invariant if the edge arguments \u03c4ij\nsatisfy the following conditions throughout the lattice\nthe sum of the edge arguments around a vertex is 2\u03bb,\n\n(3)\n\nthe sum of the edge arguments in the boundary of a m-sided face is (m \u2212 2)\u03bb\nwith the multiplicative constant being, for the vertex labeling of Fig. 4,\nR=\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03a92\nsinh 2Jij sinh 2Jjk sinh 2Jki\n\n\u0013 21\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nFor a straight line rapidity lattice it has been shown2 that the conditions (3) are satisfied\nfor edge arguments determined by the difference of the rapidities on the two straight lines\n5\n\n\fcrossing each edge. This result is expected not to depend on the particular embedding of\nthe rapidity lines in the plane but only on their topological properties. We will show that\nthe straight line requirement can be relaxed and that the only condition we need to impose\non the rapidity lines is that they do not intersect each other more than once or self-intersect.\nUsing oriented rapidity lines19 the argument \u03c4ij at the edge [ij] is chosen, in an embedding\nindependent way, according to the orientation of the edge relatively to the two rapidity lines\ncrossing it. For un-oriented edges there are two possible orientations, shown in Fig. 5, and\nthe corresponding edge arguments are chosen to be\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\nfor orientation a)\n\u03c4ij =\n,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u03bb + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 for orientation b)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the rapidities of the two rapidity lines involved.\nThis choice of edge arguments satisfies the conditions (3) everywhere on the lattice provided that the rapidity lines do not intersect each other more than once or self-intersect.\nThis result can be argued as follows.\nAs in reference1 we assume that there a rapidity line \u03b10 which is crossed by all other\n\nrapidity lines \u03b1i for i > 0. The rapidity lines are oriented is such a way that if we look\nalong the orientation of \u03b10 the rapidity lines \u03b1i cross \u03b10 from right to left. We assume also\nthat the lattice G is formed by the intersection of the rapidity lines \u03b1i after they cross the\nreference line \u03b10 . These assumptions do not place any restriction on the lattice G.\nConsider a face of G surrounding a vertex of either G or G\u2217 and let its boundary edges\nbe oriented as the respective rapidity lines. For our choice of rapidity lines orientations it\nfollows that all the boundary edges are oriented away from one of the boundary vertices and\ntowards a second one, represented in the examples of Fig. 6 by the downward and upward\ntriangle respectively. We will call such an orientation of the boundary edges standard.\nNon-standard orientations are not allowed by the restriction that the rapidity lines do\nnot intersect each other more than once or self-intersect. Consider for instance a face of G\nformed by the intersection of five rapidity lines, with the boundary edges oriented as shown\nin Fig. 7. Each rapidity line crosses the reference line \u03b10 , intersects two or more other\nrapidity lines and moves towards infinity or to the boundary of a compact region enclosing\nthe lattice G. Given the first rapidity line \u03b11 , subsequent rapidity lines will have to intersect\n\u03b10 to the left of \u03b11 to avoid double-intersections and self-intersections. This can be done for\n6\n\n\fall lines except the last one, \u03b15 , which should cross \u03b10 at some point P \u2032 or P \u2032\u2032 and then reach\nsome distant point Q\u2032 . Neither of these two requirements can be met without \u03b15 crossing\nmore than once \u03b11 or \u03b14 or self-intersecting and this non-standard orientation is not allowed.\nA similar argument can be made against orientations with more than one boundary vertex\nfor which the boundary edges converge or diverge.\nThe reader can verify that for the standard orientations of G the edge arguments defined\nby (5) satisfy the conditions (3) everywhere in the lattice and the resulting Ising model is\nZ-invariant. If the rapidity lines, or equivalently the lattice zig-zag paths, are allowed to\nintersect each other more than once or self-intersect, then the conditions (3) will not in\ngeneral be satisfied and a Z-invariant Ising model cannot be defined.\n\nIV.\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\n\nUsing the standard arguments of Z-invariance1,2 the partition function, for real positive\ncoupling constants, can be evaluated in the thermodynamic limit of the lattice G. For\ncompleteness we reproduce here these results. The partition function is given by2\n!\nX\n1\nZ = (4\u03a9) 4 N exp\n\u03c6(\u03c4ij )\n\n(6)\n\n<ij>\n\nwhere N is the number of vertices on the lattice and\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u03c4\n1\nK \u2032 q \u2032 (x)\nx\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = c\u03c4 +\ndx\n+\nr(x)\n2\n2K\n\u03c0 q(x)\n0\n\n(7)\n\nwith the various quantities being defined in table I for the three distinct regimes.\nThe local magnetization can also be evaluated2 and is found to be, for any spin on the\nlattice,\n< \u03c3i >=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22122 )1/8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\nfor \u03a92 > 1\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nfor \u03a92 \u2264 1\n\nThe regime I corresponds therefore to a low temperature ordered phase, while regimes II and\nIII correspond to high temperature disordered phases. A phase transition occurs between\nregime I and II for \u03a9 = 1.\n\n7\n\n\fV.\n\nGEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION AT CRITICALITY\n\nThe intersection properties that the rapidity lines, or equivalently the lattice zig-zag\npaths, need to satisfy in order to define a Z-invariant Ising model on a given planar lattice\nare equivalent11 to the existence of isoradial embeddings of that lattice. In this section\nwe will establish this relation between the Z-invariant model and isoradial embeddings by\nconsidering a geometric realization of the model.\nAt criticality the elliptic modulus k is zero, the complete elliptic integral \u03bb becomes\n\u03c0/2 and the coupling constants, see table I, are parameterized by elementary trigonometric\nfunctions\nsinh 2Jij = tan \u03c4ij .\n\n(9)\n\nFor non-vanishing ferromagnetic coupling constants with edge arguments in the interval\n0 < \u03c4ij < \u03c0/2 the conditions (3) can be written in terms of geometric half-angles \u03c4ij = \u03b8ij /2\nas\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03b8ij = 2\u03c0\n\n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8ij ) = 2\u03c0\n\naround each vertex of G\n\n(10)\n\naround each face of G\n\nwhere the sums are respectively over all edges which meet at a given vertex of G and over\nall edges in the boundary of a given face of G.\nA set of angles satisfying these conditions characterizes a rhombic embedding of G\u2666, in\nwhich its quadrilateral faces are drawn in the plane as rhombi with unit edge length. The\nangle \u03b8ij is the inner angle of the rhombic face which surrounds the edge [ij], see Fig. 8 for\nan example. The equations (10) guarantee that the rhombi can be joined together, at the\nvertices of G and G\u2217 , in a consistent way without overlapping.\nIn such a rhombic embedding the edges of G\u2666 crossed by a given rapidity line are parallel\nand we can associated to each rapidity line an angle characterizing this direction. Any\nrhombic embedding of G\u2666 is in fact completely characterized9 by the intersection pattern\nof G, which determines the relative positions of the rhombi, and the direction of the edges\ncrossed by each rapidity line. The condition that the rapidity lines do not intersect each\nother more than once, or self-intersect, is a consistency condition needed to ensure that all\ninterior rhombic angles are positive.\n\n8\n\n\fThe embedding of G associated with a rhombic embedding of G\u2666 is a strictly convex\nisoradial embedding. Therefore if a Z-invariant Ising model can be defined on a given lattice\nthat lattice admits isoradial embeddings in the plane. A set of critical edge parameters in\nthe interval 0 < \u03c4ij < \u03c0/2 can always be obtained by assigning angles to the rapidity lines\nin the range ]0, \u03c0[ which increase relatively to the order of intersection of the rapidity lines\n\u03b1i with the reference line \u03b10 .\nThe reverse statement is also true, if a planar lattice G has an isoradial embedding in\nthe plane then we can define a Z-invariant Ising model in G. This follows from the fact that\nzig-zag paths on an isoradial embedding do not intersect each other more than once or selfintersect. The corresponding Z-invariant Ising model can be defined with edge parameters\ndetermined by the rhombic angles of the embedding \u03c4ij = \u03bb\u03b8ij /\u03c0. From (9) it follows that\nthe model coupling constants at criticality can be expressed in terms of the respective edges\nlengths according to equation (1). The Z-invariant Ising model with such coupling constants\nis similar to the geometrical model pointed out by Baxter1,2 , the only distinction being that\nthe angles associated to the rapidity lines characterizes not the rapidity lines themselves\nbut the parallel edges of G\u2666 crossed by them. The restriction to the critical point of this\nZ-invariant Ising model is precisely the Ising model considered by the authors of references3,6\nin the context of discrete holomorphy.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we considered the Z-invariant Ising model on arbitrary planar lattices introduced without reference to a straight line rapidity lattice. We have shown that a Z-invariant\nmodel can be defined on such lattices if and only if the lattice satisfies the topological property that zig-zag paths do not self-intersect or intersect each other more than once. The\nassociated rapidity lattice is then defined with rapidity lines in one to one correspondence\nwith zig-zag paths.\nThis topological characterization has the geometric counterpart of the existence of isoradial embeddings of the lattice, establishing a close relation between the Z-invariant Ising\nmodel and the geometrical setting used in the mathematical literature to define discrete\nversions of analytic functions3,4,5 . Our results can then be stated in a purely geometric way:\na Z-invariant Ising model can be defined on an arbitrary planar lattice if and only if the\n9\n\n\flattice admits isoradial embeddings in the plane.\nThe Ising model on isoradial embeddings studied in references3,6 was shown to correspond\nto the restriction to the critical point of a particular Z-invariant Ising model. In this model,\nsimilar to Baxter's geometric solution, each rapidity line has an associated geometric angle\ncharacterizing the direction of the edges of diamond lattice G\u2666 which the rapidity line\nintersects. The coupling constants of model can be expressed at criticality in terms of\nthe inverse length of the respective edge on the isoradial embedding (1), reproducing the\nrelation between critical coupling constants and geometry found in studies of the corner\nmagnetization12 and shape dependent modular parameters13,14,15,16 of regular lattices in\nnon-trivial topologies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the EU network on \"Discrete Random Geometry\"\ngrant HPRN-CT-1999-00161.
