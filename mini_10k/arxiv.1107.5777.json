For each abelian group A and c \u2208 A we define a quandle G(A, c) on Z3 \u00d7 A. These\nquandles are generalizations of a class of non-medial Latin quandles defined by V. M. Galkin so\nwe call them Galkin quandles. Each G(A, c) is connected but not Latin unless A has odd order.\nG(A, c) is non-medial unless 3A = 0. We classify their isomorphism classes in terms of pointed\nabelian groups, and study their various properties. A family of symmetric connected quandles\nis constructed from Galkin quandles, and some aspects of knot colorings by Galkin quandles are\nalso discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSets with certain self-distributive operations called quandles have been studied since 1940s (for\nexample, [28]) in various areas with different names. They have been studied, for example, as an\nalgebraic system for symmetries and as quasi-groups. The fundamental quandle was defined in a\nmanner similar to the fundamental group [14, 20], which made quandles an important tool in knot\ntheory. Algebraic homology theories for quandles have been developed [3, 9], extensions of quandles\nby cocycles have been studied [1, 2], and applied to various properties of knots and knotted surfaces\n([4], for example).\nBefore algebraic theories of extensions were developed, Galkin [11] defined a family of quandles\nthat are extensions of the 3-element connected quandle R3 , and we call them Galkin quandles.\nEven though the definition of Galkin quandles is a special case of a cocycle extension described in\n[1], they have curious properties such as the explicit and simple defining formula, close connections\nto dihedral quandles, and the fact that they appear in the list of small connected quandles.\nIn this paper, we generalize Galkin's definition and define a family of quandles that are extensions of R3 , characterize their isomorphism classes, and study their properties. The definition is\ngiven in Section 3 after a brief review of necessary materials in Section 2. Isomorphism classes\nare characterized by pointed abelian groups in Section 4. Various algebraic properties of Galkin\nquandles are investigated in Section 5, and their knot colorings are studied in Section 6.\nAcknowledgement: Special thanks to Michael Kinyon for bringing Galkin's paper [11] to our\nattention and pointing out the construction of non-medial, Latin quandles on page 950 of [11] that\nwe call here Galkin quandles G(Zp , c1 , c2 ). We are also grateful to Professor Kinyon for helping us\n1\n\n\fwith using Mace4 for colorings of knots by quandles, and for telling us about Belousov's work on\ndistributive quasigroups.

More details can be\nfound, for example, in [1, 4, 9].\nA quandle X is a non-empty set with a binary operation (a, b) 7\u2192 a \u2217 b satisfying the following\nconditions.\n(Idempotency)\n(Invertibility)\n(Right self-distributivity)\n\nFor any a \u2208 X, a \u2217 a = a.\n\n(1)\n\nFor any b, c \u2208 X, there is a unique a \u2208 X such that a \u2217 b = c. (2)\nFor any a, b, c \u2208 X, we have (a \u2217 b) \u2217 c = (a \u2217 c) \u2217 (b \u2217 c).\n\n(3)\n\nA quandle homomorphism between two quandles X, Y is a map f : X \u2192 Y such that f (x \u2217X y) =\nf (x) \u2217Y f (y), where \u2217X and \u2217Y denote the quandle operations of X and Y , respectively. A quandle\nisomorphism is a bijective quandle homomorphism, and two quandles are isomorphic if there is a\nquandle isomorphism between them.\nTypical examples of quandles include the following.\n\u2022 Any non-empty set X with the operation x \u2217 y = x for any x, y \u2208 X is a quandle called the\ntrivial quandle.\n\u2022 A group X = G with n-fold conjugation as the quandle operation: a \u2217 b = b\u2212n abn .\n\u2022 Let n be a positive integer. For a, b \u2208 Zn (integers modulo n), define a \u2217 b \u2261 2b \u2212 a (mod n).\nThen \u2217 defines a quandle structure called the dihedral quandle, Rn . This set can be identified\nwith the set of reflections of a regular n-gon with conjugation as the quandle operation.\n\u2022 Any Z[T, T \u22121 ]-module M is a quandle with a\u2217b = T a+(1\u2212T )b, a, b \u2208 M , called an Alexander\nquandle. An Alexander quandle is also regarded as a pair (M, T ) where M is an abelian group\nand T \u2208 Aut(M ).\nLet X be a quandle. The right translation Ra : X \u2192 X, by a \u2208 X, is defined by Ra (x) = x \u2217 a\nfor x \u2208 X. Similarly the left translation La is defined by La (x) = a\u2217x. Then Ra is a permutation of\nX by Axiom (2). The subgroup of Sym(X) generated by the permutations Ra , a \u2208 X, is called the\ninner automorphism group of X, and is denoted by Inn(X). We list some definitions of commonly\nknown properties of quandles below.\n\u2022 A quandle is connected if Inn(X) acts transitively on X.\n\u2022 A Latin quandle is a quandle such that for each a \u2208 X, the left translation La is a bijection.\nThat is, the multiplication table of the quandle is a Latin square.\n\u2022 A quandle is faithful if the mapping a 7\u2192 Ra is an injection from X to Inn(X).\n\u2022 A quandle X is involutory, or a kei, if the right translations are involutions: R2a = id for all\na \u2208 X.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 It is seen that the operation  \u0304\n\u2217 on X defined by a  \u0304\u2217 b = R\u22121\nb (a) is a quandle operation, and\n(X,  \u0304\u2217) is called the dual quandle of (X, \u2217). If (X,  \u0304\u2217) is isomorphic to (X, \u2217), then (X, \u2217) is\ncalled self-dual.\n\u2022 A quandle X is medial if (a \u2217 b) \u2217 (c \u2217 d) = (a \u2217 c) \u2217 (b \u2217 d) for all a, b, c, d \u2208 X. It is also called\nabelian. It is known and easily seen that every Alexander quandle is medial.\nA coloring of an oriented knot diagram by a quandle X is a map C : A \u2192 X from the set of arcs\nA of the diagram to X such that the image of the map satisfies the relation depicted in Figure 1\nat each crossing. More details can be found in [4], for example. A coloring that assigns the same\nelement of X for all the arcs is called trivial, otherwise non-trivial. The number of colorings of\na knot diagram by a finite quandle is known to be independent of the choice of a diagram, and\nhence is a knot invariant. A coloring by a dihedral quandle Rn for a positive integer n > 1 is called\nan n-coloring. If a knot is non-trivially colored by a dihedral quandle Rn for a positive integer\nn > 1, then it is called n-colorable. In Figure 2, a non-trivial 3-coloring of the trefoil knot (31 in a\ncommon notation in a knot table [6]) is indicated. This is presented in a closed braid form. Each\ncrossing corresponds to a standard generator \u03c31 of the 2-strand braid group, and \u03c313 represents\nthree crossings together as in the figure. The dotted line indicates the closure, see [27] for more\ndetails of braids.\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\ny\nx\n\n0\n\nx*y\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Tefoil as the closure of \u03c313\n\nFigure 1: A coloring rule at a crossing\n\nThe fundamental quandle is defined in a manner similar to the fundamental group [14, 20].\nA presentation of a quandle is defined in a manner similar to groups as well, and a presentation\nof the fundamental quandle is obtained from a knot diagram (see, for example, [8]), by assigning\ngenerators to arcs of a knot diagram, and relations corresponding to crossings. The set of a coloring\nof a knot diagram K by a quandle X, then, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of quandle\nhomomorphisms from the fundamental quandle of K to X.\n\n3\n\nDefinition and notation for Galkin quandles\n\nLet A be an abelian group, also regarded naturally as a Z-module. Let \u03bc : Z3 \u2192 Z , \u03c4 : Z3 \u2192 A be\nfunctions. Define a binary operation on Z3 \u00d7 A by\n(x, a) \u2217 (y, b) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y)) x, y \u2208 Z3 , a, b \u2208 A.\n3\n\n\fProposition 3.1 For any abelian group A, the above operation \u2217 defines a quandle structure on\nZ3 \u00d7 A if \u03bc(0) = 2, \u03bc(1) = \u03bc(2) = \u22121, and \u03c4 (0) = 0.\nGalkin gave this definition in [11], page 950, for A = Zp . The proposition generalizes his result\nto any abelian group A. For the proof, we examine the axioms.\nLemma 3.2 (A) The operation is idempotent (i.e., satisfies Axiom (1)) if and only if \u03bc(0) = 2\nand \u03c4 (0) = 0. (B) The operation as right action is invertible (i.e. satisfies Axiom (2)).\nProof. Direct calculations. \u0003\nLemma 3.3 The operation \u2217 on Z3 \u00d7 A is right self-distributive (i.e., satisfies Axiom (3)) if and\nonly if \u03bc, \u03c4 satisfy the following conditions for any X, Y \u2208 Z3 :\n\u03bc(\u2212X) = \u03bc(X),\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bc(X + Y ) + \u03bc(X \u2212 Y ) = \u03bc(X)\u03bc(Y ),\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4 (X + Y ) + \u03c4 (Y \u2212 X) = \u03c4 (X) + \u03c4 (\u2212X) + \u03bc(X)\u03c4 (Y ).\n\n(6)\n\nProof. The right self-distributivity\n((x, a) \u2217 (y, b)) \u2217 (z, c) = ((x, a) \u2217 (z, c)) \u2217 ((y, b) \u2217 (z, c))\n\nfor\n\nx, y, z \u2208 Z3\n\nand a, b, c \u2208 A,\n\nis satisfied if and only if\n\u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u03bc(y \u2212 x),\n\u03bc(2y \u2212 x \u2212 z) = \u2212\u03bc(x \u2212 z) + \u03bc(y \u2212 x)\u03bc(y \u2212 z),\n\u2212\u03c4 (x \u2212 y) + \u03c4 (2y \u2212 x \u2212 z) = \u2212\u03c4 (x \u2212 z) + \u03bc(y \u2212 x)\u03c4 (y \u2212 z) + \u03c4 (y \u2212 x),\nby equating the coefficients of b, c, and the constant term.\nThe first one is equivalent to (4) by setting X = x \u2212 y. The second is equivalent to (5) by\nsetting X = y \u2212 x and Y = z \u2212 y. The third is equivalent to (6) by X = y \u2212 x and Y = y \u2212 z. \u0003\nProof of Proposition 3.1. Assume the conditions stated. By Lemma 3.2 Axioms (1) and (2) are\nsatisfied under the specifications \u03bc(0) = 2, \u03bc(1) = \u03bc(2) = \u22121, and \u03c4 (0) = 0.\nIf X = 0 or Y = 0, then (5) (together with (4)) becomes tautology. If X \u2212 Y = 0 or X + Y = 0,\nthen (5) reduces to \u03bc(2X) + 2 = \u03bc(X)2 which is satisfied by the above specifications. For R3 , if\nX + Y 6= 0 and X \u2212 Y 6= 0, then either X = 0 or Y = 0. Hence (5) is satisfied. For (6), it is\nchecked similarly, for the two cases [X = 0 or Y = 0], and [X \u2212 Y = 0 or X + Y = 0]. \u0003\nDefinition 3.4 Let A be an abelian group. The quandle defined by \u2217 on Z3 \u00d7 A by Proposition 3.1\nwith \u03bc(0) = 2, \u03bc(1) = \u03bc(2) = \u22121 and \u03c4 (0) = 0 is called the Galkin quandle and denoted by G(A, \u03c4 ).\nSince \u03c4 is specified by the values \u03c4 (1) = c1 and \u03c4 (2) = c2 , where c1 , c2 \u2208 A, we also denote it\nby G(A, c1 , c2 ).\nLemma 3.5 For any abelian group A and c1 , c2 \u2208 A, G(A, c1 , c2 ) and G(A, 0, c2 \u2212 c1 ) are isomorphic.\n4\n\n\fProof. Let c = c2 \u2212 c1 . Define \u03b7 : G(A, c1 , c2 ) \u2192 G(A, 0, c), as a map on Z3 \u00d7 A, by \u03b7(x, a) =\n(x, a + \u03b2(x)), where \u03b2(0) = \u03b2(1) = 0, and \u03b2(2) = \u2212c1 . This \u03b7 is a bijection, and we show that it is\na quandle homomorphism. We compute \u03b7((x, a) \u2217 (y, b)) and \u03b7(x, a) \u2217 \u03b7(y, b) for x, y \u2208 Z3 , a, b \u2208 A.\nIf x = y, then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = 2 and \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = 0 for both G(A, c1 , c2 ) and G(A, 0, c), so that\n\u03b7((x, a) \u2217 (x, b)) = \u03b7(x, 2b \u2212 a) = (x, 2b \u2212 a + \u03b2(x)),\n\u03b7(x, a) \u2217 \u03b7(x, b) = (x, a + \u03b2(x)) \u2217 (x, b + \u03b2(x)) = ( x, 2(b + \u03b2(x)) \u2212 (a + \u03b2(x)) )\n= (x, 2b \u2212 a + \u03b2(x))\nas desired.\nIf x \u2212 y = 1 \u2208 Z3 , then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u22121 for both G(A, c1 , c2 ) and G(A, 0, c) and \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = c1 for\nG(A, c1 , c2 ) but \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = 0 for G(A, 0, c), so that\n\u03b7((x, a) \u2217 (y, b)) = \u03b7(2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b + c1 ) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b + c1 + \u03b2(2y \u2212 x),\n\u03b7(x, a) \u2217 \u03b7(y, b) = (x, a + \u03b2(x)) \u2217 (y, b + \u03b2(y)) = ( 2y \u2212 x, \u2212(a + \u03b2(x)) \u2212 (b + \u03b2(y)) ).\nThis holds if and only if \u03b2(x) + \u03b2(y) + \u03b2(2y \u2212 x) = \u2212c1 , which is true since x 6= y implies that\nexactly one of x, y, 2y \u2212 x is 2 \u2208 Z3 .\nIf x \u2212 y = 2 \u2208 Z3 , then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u22121 for both G(A, c1 , c2 ) and G(A, 0, c) and \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = c2 for\nG(A, c1 , c2 ) but \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = c2 \u2212 c1 = c for G(A, 0, c), so that\n\u03b7((x, a) \u2217 (y, b)) = \u03b7(2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b + c2 ) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b + c2 + \u03b2(2y \u2212 x)),\n\u03b7(x, a) \u2217 \u03b7(y, b) = (x, a + \u03b2(x)) \u2217 (y, b + \u03b2(y)) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212(a + \u03b2(x)) \u2212 (b + \u03b2(y)))\n= (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b \u2212 \u03b2(x) \u2212 \u03b2(y) + (c2 \u2212 c1 )),\nand again these are equal for the same reason as above. \u0003\nNotation. Since by Lemma 3.5, any Galkin quandle is isomorphic to G(A, 0, c) for an abelian\ngroup A and c \u2208 A, we denote G(A, 0, c) by G(A, c) for short.\nAny finite abelian group is a product Zn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Znk where the positive integers nj satisfy that\nnj |nj+1 for j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. In this case any element c \u2208 A is written in a vector form [c1 , . . . , ck ],\nwhere cj \u2208 Znj . Then the corresponding Galkin quandle is denoted by G(A, [c1 , . . . , ck ]).\nRemark 3.6 We note that the definition of Galkin quandles induces a functor. Let Ab0 denote\nthe category of pointed abelian groups, that, is the category whose objects are pairs (A, c) where A\nis an abelian group and c \u2208 A and whose morphisms f : (A, c) \u2192 (B, d) are group homomorphisms\nf : A \u2192 B such that f (c) = d. Let Q be the category of quandles, consisting quandles as objects\nand quandle homomorphisms as morphisms.\nF\nThen the correspondence (A, c) 7\u2192 G(A, c) defines a functor F : Ab0 \u2192 Q. It is easy to verify\nthat if a morphism f : (A, c) \u2192 (B, d) is given then the mapping F(f )(x, a) = (x, f (a)), (x, a) \u2208\nG(A, c) = Z3 \u00d7 A, is a homomophism from G(A, c) to G(B, d), and satisfies F(gf ) = F(g)F(f )\nand F(id(A,c) ) = idG(A,c) .\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nIsomorphism classes\n\nIn this section we classify isomorphism classes of Galkin quandles.\nLemma 4.1 Let A be an abelian group, and h : A \u2192 A\u2032 be a group isomorphism. Then Galkin\nquandles G(A, \u03c4 ) and G(A\u2032 , h\u03c4 ) are isomorphic as quandles.\nProof. Define f : G(A, \u03c4 ) \u2192 G(A\u2032 , h\u03c4 ), as a map from Z3 \u00d7 A to Z3 \u00d7 A\u2032 , by f (x, a) = (x, h(a)).\nThis f is a bijection, and we show that it is a quandle homomorphism by computing f ((x, a)\u2217(y, b))\nand f (x, a) \u2217 f (y, b) for x, y \u2208 Z3 , a, b \u2208 A.\nIf x = y, then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = 2 and \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = 0 = h\u03c4 (0) for both G(A, \u03c4 ) and G(A\u2032 , h\u03c4 ), so that\nf ((x, a) \u2217 (x, b)) = f (x, 2b \u2212 a) = (x, h(2b \u2212 a)),\nf (x, a) \u2217 f (x, b) = (x, h(a)) \u2217 (x, h(b)) = ( x, 2h(b) \u2212 h(a) )\nas desired.\nIf x \u2212 y = 1 \u2208 Z3 , then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u22121 for both G(A, \u03c4 ) and G(A\u2032 , h\u03c4 ).\nf ((x, a) \u2217 (y, b)) = f (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y)) = ( 2y \u2212 x, h(\u2212a \u2212 b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y)) ),\nf (x, a) \u2217 f (y, b) = (x, h(a)) \u2217 (y, h(b)) = ( 2y \u2212 x, \u2212h(a) \u2212 h(b) + h\u03c4 (x \u2212 y) )\nas desired. \u0003\nLemma 4.2 Let c, d, n be positive integers. If gcd(c, n) = d, then G(Zn , c) is isomorphic to\nG(Zn , d).\nProof. If A = Zn then Aut(A) = Z\u2217n = units of Zn , and the divisors of n are representatives of the\norbits of Z\u2217n acting on Zn . \u0003\nThus we may choose the divisors of n for the values of c for representing isomorphism classes\nof G(Zn , c).\nCorollary 4.3 If A is a vector space (elementary p-group) then there are exactly two isomorphism\nclasses of Galkin quandles G(A, \u03c4 ).\nProof. If A is a vector space containing non-zero vectors c1 and c2 , then there is a non-singular\nlinear transformation h of A such that h(c1 ) = c2 . That G(A, 0) is not isomorphic to G(A, c) if\nc 6= 0 follows from Lemma 4.5 below. \u0003\nFor distinguishing isomorphism classes, cycle structures of the right action is useful, and we use\nthe following lemmas.\nLemma 4.4 For any abelian group A, the Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) is connected.\n\n6\n\n\fProof. Recall that the operation is defined by the formula\n(x, a) \u2217 (y, b) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y)),\n\u03bc(0) = 2, \u03bc(1) = \u03bc(2) = \u22121 and \u03c4 (0) = 0. If x 6= y, then (x, a)\u2217(y, b) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a\u2212 b+ ci ) = (z, c)\nwhere i = 1 or 2 and x, y \u2208 Z3 , a, b \u2208 A. Note that {x, y, 2y \u2212 x} = Z3 if x 6= y. In particular, for\nany (x, a) and (z, c) with x 6= z, there is (y, b) such that (x, a) \u2217 (y, b) = (z, c).\nFor any (x, a1 ) and (x, a2 ) where x \u2208 Z3 , a1 , a2 \u2208 A, take (z, c) \u2208 Z3 \u00d7 A such that z 6= x. Then\nthere are (y, b1 ), (y, b2 ) such that x 6= y 6= z and (x, a1 ) \u2217 (y, b1 ) = (z, c) and (z, c) \u2217 (y, b2 ) = (x, a2 ).\nHence G(A, \u03c4 ) is connected. \u0003\nLemma 4.5 The cycle structure of a right translation in G(A, \u03c4 ) where \u03c4 (0) = \u03c4 (1) = 0 and\n\u03c4 (2) = c, consists of 1-cycles, 2-cycles and 2k-cycles where k is the order of c in the group A.\nSince isomorphic quandles have the same cycle structure of right translations, G(A, c) and\nG(A, c\u2032 ) for c, c\u2032 \u2208 A are not isomorphic unless the orders of c and c\u2032 coincide.\nProof. Let \u03c4 (0) = 0, \u03c4 (1) = 0 and \u03c4 (2) = c. Then by Lemma 4.4, the cycle structure of each column\nis the same as the cycle structure of the right translation by (0, 0), that is, of the permutation\nf (x, a) = (x, a) \u2217 (0, 0) = (\u2212x, \u2212a + \u03c4 (x)).\nWe show that this permutation has cycles of length only 1, 2 and twice the order of c in A.\nSince f (0, a) = (0, \u2212a) for a \u2208 A, a 6= 0, we have f 2 (0, a) = (0, a) so that (0, a) generates a 2-cycle,\nor a 1-cycle if 2a = 0. Now from f (1, a) = (2, \u2212a) and f (2, a) = (1, \u2212a + c) for a \u2208 A, by induction\nit is easy to see that for k > 0, f 2k (1, a) = (1, a + kc) and f 2k (2, a) = (2, a \u2212 kc). In the case of\n(1, a), a 6= 0, the cycle closes when a + kc = a in A. The smallest k for which this holds is the\norder of c, in which case the cycle is of length 2k. A cycle beginning at (2, a) similarly has this\nsame length. \u0003\nProposition 4.6 Let n be a positive integer, A = Zn , and ci , c\u2032i \u2208 Zn for i = 1, 2. Two Galkin\nquandles G(A, c1 , c2 ) and G(A, c\u20321 , c\u20322 ) are isomorphic if and only if gcd(c1 \u2212 c2 , n) = gcd(c\u20321 \u2212 c\u20322 , n).\nProof. If gcd(c1 \u2212 c2 , n) = gcd(c\u20321 \u2212 c\u20322 , n), then they are isomorphic by Lemmas 3.5 and 4.2. The\ncycle structures are different if gcd(c1 \u2212 c2 , n) 6= gcd(c\u20321 \u2212 c\u20322 , n) by Lemma 4.5, and hence they are\nnot isomorphic. \u0003\nRemark 4.7 The cycle structure is not sufficient for non-cyclic groups A. For example, let A =\nZ2 \u00d7 Z4 . Then G(A, [1, 0]) and G(A, [0, 2]) have the same cycle structure for right translations, with\ncycle lengths {2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4} in a multiset notation, yet they are known to be not isomorphic. (In\nthe notation of Example 4.12 (see below), G(A, [1, 0]) = C[24, 29] and G(A, [0, 2]) = C[24, 31], that\nare not isomorphic.) We note that there is no automorphism of A carrying [1, 0] to [0, 2].\nMore generally the isomorphism classes of Galkin quandles are characterized as follows.\nTheorem 4.8 Suppose A, A\u2032 are finite abelian groups. Two Galkin quandles G(A, \u03c4 ) and G(A\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 )\nare isomorphic if and only if there exists a group isomorphism h : A \u2192 A\u2032 such that h\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2032 .\n\n7\n\n\fOne implication is Lemma 4.1. For the other, first we prove the following two lemmas. We will\nuse a well known description of the automorphisms of a finite abelian group which can be found in\n[13, 26].\nLemma 4.9 Let A be a finite abelian p-group and let f : pA \u2192 pA be an automorphism.

By 2.1\u25e6 , c2 = 3d, which\nis a contradiction.\nNote that \u03b2(0, *) : 3A2 \u2192 3A\u20322 is an isomorphism and\n\u03b2(0, 3c2 ) = 3\u03b2(0, c2 )\n\n(by 2.1\u25e6 )\n\n= 3c\u20322 .\nBy Lemma 4.10, there exists an isomorphism f : A2 \u2192 A\u20322 such that f (c2 ) = c\u20322 . \u0003\nRemark 4.11 The numbers of isomorphism classes of order 3n, from n = 1 to n = 100, are as\nfollows:\n1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4, 2, 10, 5, 4, 2, 10, 2, 4, 4, 20, 2, 10, 2, 10, 4, 4, 2, 20, 5, 4, 10, 10, 2, 8, 2, 36, 4, 4, 4, 25, 2, 4, 4, 20,\n2, 8, 2, 10, 10, 4, 2, 40, 5, 10, 4, 10, 2, 20, 4, 20, 4, 4, 2, 20, 2, 4, 10, 65, 4, 8, 2, 10, 4, 8, 2, 50, 2, 4, 10, 10, 4, 8,\n14\n\n\f2, 40, 20, 4, 2, 20, 4, 4, 4, 20, 2, 20, 4, 10, 4, 4, 4, 72, 2, 10, 10, 25.\nIn [7] it is shown that the number N (n) of isomorphism classes of Galkin quandles of order n\nis multiplicative, that is, if gcd(n, m) = 1 then N (nm) = N (n)N (m), so it suffices to find N (q n )\nP\nfor all prime powers q n . In [7] it is established that N (q n ) = 0\u2264m\u2264n p(m)p(n \u2212 m), where p(m)\nis the number of partitions of the integer m. In particular, N (q n ) is independent of the prime q.\nThe sequence n 7\u2192 N (q n ) appears in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS, [23])\nas sequence A000712.\nExample 4.12 In [30], connected quandles are listed up to order 35. For a positive integer n > 1,\nlet q(n) be the number of isomorphism classes of connected quandles of order n. For a positive\ninteger n > 1, if q(n) 6= 0, then we denote by C[n, i] the i-th quandle of order n in their list\n(1 < n \u2264 35, i = 1, . . . , q(n)). We note that q(n) = 0 for n = 2, 14, 22, 26, and 34 (for 1 < n \u2264 35).\nThe quandle C[n, i] is denoted by Qn,i in [31] (and they are left-distributive in [31], so that the\nmatrix of C[n, i] is the transpose of the matrix of Qn,i ). Isomorphism classes of Galkin quandles\nare identified with those in their list in Table 1.\nThe 4-digit numbers to the right of each row in Table 1 indicate the numbers of knots that\nare colored non-trivially by these Galkin quandles, out of total 2977 knots in the table [6] with 12\ncrossings or less. See Section 6 for more on this.\n\n5\n\nProperties of Galkin quandles\n\nIn this section, we investigate various properties of Galkin quandles.\nLemma 5.1 The Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) is Latin if and only if |A| is odd.\nProof. To show that it is Latin if n is odd, first note that R3 is Latin. Suppose that (x, a) \u2217 (y, b) =\n(x, a) \u2217 (y \u2032 , b\u2032 ). Then we have the equations\n\u2212x + 2y = \u2212x + 2y \u2032\n\n(32)\n\n\u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y \u2032 )b\u2032 + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y \u2032 ).\n\n(33)\n\nFrom (32) it follows that y = y \u2032 and it follows from (33) that \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b = \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b\u2032 . Now since\n|A| is odd, the left module action of 2 on A is invertible, and hence b = b\u2032 . If |A| is even there is a\nnon-zero element b of order 2 and hence (0, 0) \u2217 (0, b) = (0, 0) \u2217 (0, 0), so the quandle is not Latin.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.2 Any Galkin quandle is faithful.\nProof. We show that if (x, a) \u2217 (y, b) = (x, a) \u2217 (y \u2032 , b\u2032 ) holds for all (x, a), then (y, b) = (y \u2032 , b\u2032 ). We\nhave y = y \u2032 immediately. From the second factor\n\u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b\u2032 + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y),\nwe have \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b = \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b\u2032 for any x. Pick x such that x 6= y, then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u22121, hence b = b\u2032 .\n\u0003\n15\n\n\fLemma 5.3 If A\u2032 is a subgroup of A and c\u2032 is in A\u2032 , then G(A\u2032 , c\u2032 ) is a subquandle of G(A, c\u2032 ).\nProof. Immediate. \u0003\nLemma 5.4 Any Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) consists of three disjoint subquandles {x}\u00d7A for x \u2208 Z3 ,\nand each is a product of dihedral quandles.\nProof. Immediate. \u0003\nWe note the following somewhat curious quandles from Lemma 5.4: For a positive integer k,\nG(Zk2 , [0, . . . , 0]) is a connected quandle that is a disjoint union of three trivial subquandles of order\n2k .\nLemma 5.5 The Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) has R3 as a subquandle if and only if \u03c4 = 0 or 3 divides\n|A|.\nProof. If A is any group and \u03c4 = 0, then (x, 0) \u2217 (y, 0) = (2y \u2212 x, 0) for any x, y \u2208 Z3 , so that\nZ3 \u00d7 {0} is a subquandle isomorphic to R3 . If 3 divides |A|, then A has a subgroup B isomorphic\nto Z3 . In the subquandle {0} \u00d7 B, (0, a) \u2217 (0, b) = (0, \u2212a + 2b) for a, b \u2208 B, so that {0} \u00d7 B is a\nsubquandle isomorphic to R3 .\nConversely, let S = {(x, a), (y, b), (z, d)} be a subquandle of G(A, c) isomorphic to R3 . Note\nthat the quandle operation of R3 is commutative, and the product of any two elements is equal to\nthe third. We examine two cases.\nCase 1: x = y = z. In this case we have\n(x, a) \u2217 (x, b) = (x, \u2212a + 2b) = (x, d),\n(x, b) \u2217 (x, a) = (x, \u2212b + 2a) = (x, d).\nHence we have \u2212a + 2b = \u2212b + 2a so that 3(a \u2212 b) = 0. If there are no elements of order 3 in A,\nthen we have a \u2212 b = 0 and so b = a. This is a contradiction to the fact that S contains 3 elements,\nso there is an element of order 3 in A, hence 3 divides |A|.\nCase 2: x, y and z are all distinct (if two are distinct then all three are). In this case consider\nS = {(0, a), (1, b), (2, d)}. Now we have\n(2, d) \u2217 (0, a) = (1, \u2212d \u2212 a + c) = (1, b),\n(0, a) \u2217 (2, d) = (1, \u2212a \u2212 d)\n= (1, b).\nHence we have \u2212d \u2212 a + c = \u2212a \u2212 d, so that c = 0, and we have \u03c4 = 0. \u0003\nLemma 5.6 The Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) is left-distributive if and only if 3A = 0, i.e., every\nelement of A has order 3.\nProof. Let \u03c4 (1) = c1 , \u03c4 (2) = c2 . Let a = (0, 0), b = (0, \u03b1) and c = (1, 0) for \u03b1 \u2208 A. Then we get\na \u2217 (b \u2217 c) = (1, \u03b1 \u2212 c2 + c1 ) and (a \u2217 b) \u2217 (a \u2217 c) = (1, \u22122\u03b1 \u2212 c2 + c1 ). If these are equal, then 3\u03b1 = 0\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 A.\n\n16\n\n\fConversely, suppose that every element of A has order 3. Then we have \u03bc(x)a = 2a for any\na \u2208 A. Then one computes\n(x, a) \u2217 [(y, b) \u2217 (z, c)]\n\n(34)\n\n= (x \u2217 (y \u2217 z), \u2212a + b + c \u2212 \u03c4 (y \u2212 z) + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y \u2217 z)),\n[(x, a) \u2217 (y, b)] \u2217 [(x, a) \u2217 (z, c)]\n= ((x \u2217 y) \u2217 (x \u2217 z), \u2212a + b + c \u2212 \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) \u2212 \u03c4 (x \u2212 z) + \u03c4 (x \u2217 y \u2212 x \u2217 z)).\n\n(35)\n\nIf all x, y, z are distinct, then x \u2212 y = 1 or x \u2212 y = 2, and x \u2217 y = z, x \u2217 z = y, y \u2217 z = x. If x \u2212 y = 1,\nthen z = x + 1 and y \u2212 z = 1, x \u2212 z = 2, and one computes that (34) = \u2212c1 = (35). If x \u2212 y = 2,\nthen one computes (34) = \u2212c2 = (35). The other cases for x, y, z are checked similarly. \u0003\nProposition 5.7 The Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) is Alexander if and only if 3A = 0.\nProof. If G(A, \u03c4 ) is Alexander then since it is connected it is left-distributive, hence Lemma 5.6\nimplies 3A = 0. Conversely, suppose 3A = 0. Then A = Zk3 for some positive integer k, and\nis an elementary 3-group. By Corollary 4.3 there are two isomorphism classes, G(Zk3 , [0, . . . , 0])\nand G(Zk3 , [0, . . . , 0, 1]). The quandle G(Z3 , 1) = C[9, 6] is isomorphic to Z3 [t]/(t + 1)2 by a direct\ncomparison. Hence the two classes are isomorphic to the Alexander quandle R3k and R3k\u22122 \u00d7\nZ3 [t]/(t + 1)2 , respectively. \u0003\nProposition 5.8 The Galkin quandle G(A, c) is medial if and only if 3A = 0.\nProof. We have seen that if 3A = 0 then G(A, c) is Alexander and hence is medial. Suppose 3b 6= 0\nfor some b \u2208 A. Then consider the products\nX = ((0, 0) \u2217 (1, b)) \u2217 ((1, 0) \u2217 (0, 0)) = (\u22121, b \u2212 \u03c4 (\u22121))\nY\n\nand\n\n= ((0, 0) \u2217 (1, 0)) \u2217 ((1, b) \u2217 (0, 0)) = (\u22121, \u2212\u03c4 (\u22121) \u2212 2b).\n\nSince 3b 6= 0 we have X 6= Y and so G(A, c) is not medial. \u0003\nRemark 5.9 The fact that the same condition appeared in 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 is explained as follows.\nAlexander quandles are left-distributive and medial. It is easy to check that for a finite Alexander\nquandle (M, T ) with T \u2208 Aut(M ), the following are equivalent: (1) (M, T ) is connected, (2) (1\u2212 T )\nis an automorphism of M , and (3) (M, T ) is Latin. It was also proved by Toyoda [29] that a Latin\nquandle is Alexander if and only if it is medial. As noted by Galkin, G(Z5 , 0) and G(Z5 , 1) are the\nsmallest non-medial Latin quandles and hence the smallest non-Alexander Latin quandles.\nWe note that medial quandles are left-distributive (by idempotency). We show in Theorem 5.10\n(below) that any left-distributive connected quandle is Latin. This implies, by Toyoda's theorem,\nthat every medial connected quandle is Alexander and Latin. The smallest Latin quandles that are\nnot left-distributive are the Galkin quandles of order 15.\nIt is known that the smallest left-distributive Latin quandle that is not Alexander is of order\n81. This is due to V. D. Belousov. See, for example, [24] or Section 5 of Galkin [11].\nTheorem 5.10 Every finite connected left-distributive connected quandle is Latin.\n17\n\n\fProof. Let (X, \u2217) be a finite, connected, and left-distributive quandle. For each a \u2208 X, let Xa =\n{a \u2217 x : x \u2208 X}.\n1\u25e6 We claim that |Xa | = |Xb | for all a, b \u2208 X. For any a, y \u2208 X, we have\n|Xa | = |Xa \u2217 y| = |{(a \u2217 x) \u2217 y : x \u2208 X}| = |{(a \u2217 y) \u2217 (x \u2217 y) : x \u2208 X}| = |Xa\u2217y |.\nSince X is connected, we have |Xa | = |Xb | for all a, b \u2208 X.\n2\u25e6 Fix a \u2208 X. If |Xa | = X, by 1\u25e6 , Xb = X for all b \u2208 X and we are done. So assume |Xa | < |X|.\nClearly, (Xa , \u2217) is a left-distributive quandle. Since (X, \u2217) is connected and x 7\u2192 a \u2217 x is an onto\nhomomorphism form (X, \u2217) to (Xa , \u2217), (Xa , \u2217) is also connected. Using induction, we may assume\nthat (Xa , \u2217) is Latin.\n3\u25e6 For each y \u2208 Y , we claim that Xa\u2217y = Xa . In fact,\nXa\u2217y \u2283 (a \u2217 y) \u2217 Xa\n= Xa\n\n(since Xa is Latin).\n\nSince |Xa\u2217y | = |Xa |, we must have Xa\u2217y = Xa .\nS\n4\u25e6 Since (X, \u2217) is connected, by 3\u25e6 , Xb = Xa for all b \u2208 X. Thus X = b\u2208X Xb = Xa , which is\na contradiction. \u0003\nProposition 5.11 Any Galkin quandle is self-dual, that is, isomorphic to its dual.\nProof. The dual quandle structure of G(A, \u03c4 ) = G(A, c1 , c2 ) is written by\n(x, a)  \u0304\n\u2217 (y, b) = (x  \u0304\u2217 y, \u2212a + \u03bc(y \u2212 x)b + \u03c4 (y \u2212 x))\nfor (x, a), (y, b) \u2208 G(A, \u03c4 ). Note that \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u03bc(y \u2212 x) and \u03c4 (y \u2212 x) = c\u2212i if \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = ci for any\nx, y \u2208 X and i \u2208 Z3 . Hence its dual is G(A, c2 , c1 ). The isomorphism is given by f : Z3 \u00d7A \u2192 Z3 \u00d7A\nthat is defined by f (x, a) = (\u2212x, a). \u0003\nCorollary 5.12 For any positive integer n, a Galkin quandle G(A, c1 , c2 ) is involutory (kei) if and\nonly if c1 = c2 \u2208 A.\nProof. A quandle is a kei if and only if it is the same as its dual, i.e., the identity map is an\nisomorphism between the dual quandle and itself. Hence this follows from Proposition 5.11. \u0003\nA good involution [15, 16] \u03c1 on a quandle (X, \u2217) is an involution \u03c1 : X \u2192 X (a map with\n= id) such that x \u2217 \u03c1(y) = x  \u0304\n\u2217 y and \u03c1(x \u2217 y) = \u03c1(x) \u2217 y for any x, y \u2208 X. A quandle with a good\ninvolution is called a symmetric quandle. A kei is a symmetric quandle with \u03c1 = id (in this case \u03c1\nis said to be trivial). Symmetric quandles have been used for unoriented knots and non-orientable\nsurface-knots.\nSymmetric quandles with non-trivial good involution have been hard to find. Other than\ncomputer calculations, very few constructions have been known. In [15, 16], non-trivial good\ninvolutions were defined on dihedral quandles of even order, which are not connected. Infinitely\nmany symmetric connected quandles were constructed in [5] as extensions of odd order dihedral\nquandles: For each odd 2n+1 (n \u2208 Z, n > 0), a symmetric connected quandle of order (2n+1)22n+1\nwas given, that are not keis. Here we use Galkin quandles to construct more symmetric quandles.\n\n\u03c12\n\n18\n\n\fProposition 5.13 For any positive integer n, there exists a symmetric connected quandle of order\n6n, that is not involutory.\nProof. We show that if an abelian group A has an element c \u2208 A of order 2, then G(A, c) is a\nsymmetric quandle. (A finite abelian group A has an element of order 2 if and only if |A| is even.)\nNote that G(A, c) is not involutory by Corollary 5.12.\nDefine an involution \u03c1 : Z3 \u00d7 A \u2192 Z3 \u00d7 A by \u03c1(x, a) = (x, a + c), where c \u2208 A is a fixed element\nof order 2 and x \u2208 Z3 , a \u2208 A. The map \u03c1 is an involution. It satisfies the required conditions as\nwe show below. For x, y \u2208 Z3 , we have\n(x, a) \u2217 \u03c1(y, b) = (x, a) \u2217 (y, b + c) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)(b + c) + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y),\n(x, a)  \u0304\n\u2217 (y, b) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(y \u2212 x)b + \u03c4 (y \u2212 x)),\nwhere the last equality follows from the proof of Proposition 5.11. If x = y, then \u03bc(x \u2212 y) =\n2 = \u03bc(y \u2212 x) and \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) = 0 = \u03c4 (y \u2212 x), and the above two terms are equal. If x 6= y, then\n\u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u22121 = \u03bc(y \u2212 x), and exactly one of \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) and \u03c4 (y \u2212 x) is c and the other is 0, so that\nthe equality holds.\nNext we compute\n\u03c1( (x, a) \u2217 (y, b) )\n= \u03c1(2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y)) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y) + c),\n\u03c1(x, a) \u2217 (y, b)\n= (x, a + c) \u2217 (y, b) = (2y \u2212 x, \u2212a \u2212 c + \u03bc(x \u2212 y)b + \u03c4 (x \u2212 y))\nand these are equal. \u0003\nFor equations in Lemma 3.3, we have the following for Zp .\nLemma 5.14 Let p > 3 be a prime and let \u03bc : Zp \u2192 Z be a function satisfying \u03bc(0) = 2 and\n\u03bc(x + y) + \u03bc(x \u2212 y) = \u03bc(x)\u03bc(y)\n\n(36)\n\nfor any x, y \u2208 Zp . Then \u03bc(x) = 2 for all x \u2208 Zp .\nP\nProof. First we note that we only need to prove x\u2208Zp \u03bc(x) 6= 0. Denote this sum by S. Summing\nEquation (36) as y runs over Zp , we have 2S = S\u03bc(x). So if S 6= 0, we have \u03bc(x) = 2 for all x \u2208 Zp .\nAssume to the contrary that S = 0. Since \u03bc(kx)\u03bc(x) = \u03bc((k + 1)x) + \u03bc((k \u2212 1)x), it is easy to\nsee by induction that\n\u0012 \u0013\n1 X k\nk\n\u03bc(x) =\n\u03bc((k \u2212 2i)x).\n(37)\n2\ni\n0\u2264i\u2264k\n\n(Here we also use the fact that \u03bc(\u2212x) = \u03bc(x), which follows from the fact that \u03bc(x \u2212 y) =\n\u03bc(x)\u03bc(y) \u2212 \u03bc(x + y) is symmetric in x and y.)

Recall from Lemma 5.4 that any\nGalkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) consists of three disjoint subquandles {x} \u00d7 A for x \u2208 Z3 , and each is a\nproduct of dihedral quandles. Also any Galkin quandle has R3 as a quotient. Thus we look at\nrelations between colorings by dihedral quandles and those by Galkin quandles.\nFirst we present the numbers of n-colorable knots with 12 crossings or less, out of 2977 knots\nin the knot table from [6], for comparison with Table 1. These are for dihedral quandles and their\nproducts that may be of interest and relevant for comparisons.\nR3 : 1084,\nR19 : 159,\n\nR5 :\n670,\nR21 : 1386,\n\nR7 : 479,\nR23 : 128,\n\nR11 : 285,\nR29 :\n97\n\nR15 : 1512,\nR31 :\n87,\n\nR17 : 192,\nR33 : 1260.\n\nRemark 6.1 We note that many rig Galkin quandles in Table 1 have the same number (1084) of\nnon-trivially colorable knots as the number of 3-colorable knots. We make a few observations on\nthese Galkin quandles.\nBy Lemma 5.5, a Galkin quandle has R3 as a subquandle if \u03c4 = 0 or 3 divides |A|, and among\nrig Galkin quandles with the number 1084, 17 of them satisfy this condition. Hence any 3-colorable\nknot is non-trivially colored by these Galkin quandles. The converse is not necessarily true: G(Z5 , 0)\nhas \u03c4 = 0 but has the number 1512. See Corollary 6.5 for more on these quandles.\nThe remaining 6 rig Galkin quandles with the number 1084 have C[6, 2] as a subquandle:\nC[12, 5], C[12, 9], C[24, 28], C[24, 29], C[24, 31], C[24, 33].\n20\n\n\fIt was conjectured [5] that if a knot is 3-colorable, then it is non-trivially colored by C[6, 2] (R\u03033\nin their notation). It is also seen that any non-trivial coloring by C[6, 2] descends to a non-trivial\n3-coloring via the surjection C[6, 2] \u2192 R3 , so if the conjecture is true, then any knot is non-trivially\ncolored by these quandles if and only if it is 3-colorable. See also Remarks 6.6 and 6.7.\nProposition 6.2 Let K be a knot with a prime determinant p > 3. Then K is non-trivially colored\nby a finite Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) if and only if p divides |A|.\nProof. Let K be a knot with the determinant that is a prime p > 3. By Fox's theorem [10], for any\nprime p, a knot is p-colorable if and only if its determinant is divisible by p. Hence K is p-colorable,\nand not 3-colorable.\nLet G(A, \u03c4 ) be any Galkin quandle and C : A \u2192 G(A, \u03c4 ) be a coloring, where A is the set\nof arcs of a knot diagram of K. By the surjection r : G(A, \u03c4 ) \u2192 R3 , the coloring C induces\na coloring r \u25e6 C : A \u2192 R3 . Since K is not 3-colorable, it is a trivial coloring, and therefore,\nC(A) \u2282 r \u22121 (x) for some x \u2208 R3 . The subquandle r \u22121 (x) for any x \u2208 R3 is an Alexander quandle\n{x} \u00d7 A with the operation (x, a) \u2217 (x, b) = (x, 2b \u2212 a), so that it is a product of dihedral quandles\n{x}\u00d7A = Rq1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Rqk for some positive integer k and prime powers qj , j = 1, . . . , k (Lemma 5.4).\nIt is known that the number of colorings by a product quandle X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk is the product of\nnumbers of colorings by Xi for i = 1, . . . , k. It is also seen that a knot is non-trivially colored by\nRpk for a prime p if and only if it is p-colorable. Hence K is non-trivially colored by {x} \u00d7 A if and\nonly if one of q1 , . . . , qk is a power of p. \u0003\nCorollary 6.3 For any positive integer n not divisible by 3 and any finite Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ),\nall 2-bridge knots with the determinant n have the same number of colorings by G(A, \u03c4 ).\nml\n1\n(in the prime decompoProof. Let K be a two-bridge knot with the determinant n = pm\n1 * * * pl\nsition form), where pi 6= 3 for i = 1, . . . , l, and let A = Rq1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Rqk be the decomposition for\nprime powers, as a quandle. By Fox's theorem [10], for a prime p, K is p-colorable if and only if p\ndivides the determinant of K. Hence K is pi -colorable for i = 1, . . . , l, and not 3-colorable. By the\nproof of Proposition 6.2, the number of colorings by a Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ) of K is determined\nby the number of colorings by the dihedral quandles Rqj that are factors of A.\nThe double branched cover M2 (K) of the 3-sphere S3 along a 2-bridge knot K is a lens space\n([27], for example) and its first homology group H1 (M2 (K), Z) is cyclic. If the determinant of K\nis n then it is isomorphic to Zn ([19], for example). It is known [25] that the number of colorings\nby Rqj is equal to the order of the group (Z \u2295 H1 (M2 (K), Z)) \u2297 Zqj , which is determined by n and\nqj alone. \u0003\n\nExample 6.4 Among knots with 8 crossings or less, the following sets of knots have the same\nnumbers of colorings by all finite Galkin quandles from Corollary 6.3: {41 , 51 } (determinant 5),\n{52 , 71 } (7), {62 , 72 } (11), {63 , 73 , 81 } (13), {75 , 82 , 83 } (17), {76 , 84 } (19), {86 , 87 } (23), {88 , 89 }\n(25), {812 , 813 } (29). This exhausts such sets of knots up to 8 crossings.\nComputer calculations show that the set of knots up to 8 crossings with determinant 9 is\n{61 , 820 }, and these have different numbers of colorings by some Galkin quandles. The determinant\nwas looked up at KnotInfo [6].\nThere are two knots (74 and 821 , up to 8 crossings) with determinant 15. They can be distinguished by the numbers of colorings by some Galkin quandles, according to computer calculations.\n21\n\n\fCorollary 6.5 Let p be an odd prime. Then a knot K is non-trivially colored by the Galkin quandle\nG(Zp , 0) if and only if it is 3p-colorable.\nProof. Suppose it is 3p-colorable, then it is non-trivially colored by R3p which is isomorphic to\nR3 \u00d7 Rp , so that it is either 3-colorable or p-colorable. If K is 3-colorable, then since G(Zp , 0) has\nR3 as a subquandle by Lemma 5.5, K is non-trivially colored by G(Zp , 0). If K is p-colorable, then\nsince G(Zp , 0) has {0} \u00d7 Rp as a subquandle by Lemma 5.4, K is non-trivially colored by G(Zp , 0).\nSuppose a knot K is non-trivially colored by G(Zp , 0), where p is an odd prime. If K is 3colorable, then it is 3p-colorable, and we are done. If K is not 3-colorable, then by the proof of\nProposition 6.2, K is non-trivially colored by {x} \u00d7 Rp , where x \u2208 Z3 . Hence K is p-colorable, and\nso 3p-colorable. \u0003\nRemark 6.6 According to computer calculations, the following sets of Galkin quandles (in the\nnumbering of Table 1) have the same numbers of colorings for all 2977 knots with 12 crossings or\nless. Thus we conjecture that it is the case for all knots. If a Galkin quandle does not appear in\nthe list, then it means that it has different numbers of colorings for some knots, comparing to other\nGalkin quandles. The numbers of colorings are distinct for distinct sets listed below as well.\n{C[6, 1], C[6, 2]}, {C[12, 5], C[12, 6]}, {C[12, 8], C[12, 9]}, {C[18, 1], C[18, 4]},\n{C[18, 5], C[18, 8]}, {C[24, 27], C[24, 28]}, {C[24, 29], C[24, 30], C[24, 31]},\n{C[24, 38], C[24, 39]}, {C[30, 12], C[30, 14]}, {C[30, 13], C[30, 15]}.\nRemark 6.7 In contrast to the preceding remark, if we relax the requirement of coloring the\nsame number of times, and instead consider two quandles equivalent if each colors the same knots\nnon-trivially (among these 2977 knots), then we get the following 4 equivalence classes.\n{C[3, 1], C[6, 1], C[6, 2], C[9, 2], C[9, 6], C[12, 5], C[12, 6], C[12, 8], C[12, 9], C[18, 1], C[18, 4],\nC[18, 5], C[18, 8], C[24, 27], C[24, 28], C[24, 29], C[24, 30], C[24, 31], C[24, 38], C[24, 39], C[27, 2],\nC[27, 12], C[27, 13], C[27, 23], C[27, 55]},\n{C[12, 7], C[24, 32], C[24, 33]},\n{C[15, 5], C[30, 12], C[30, 14]},\n{C[15, 6], C[30, 13], C[30, 15]}.\nThus we conjecture that it is the case for all knots. Of these, the first family with many elements\nconsists of quandles with C[3, 1], C[6, 1] or C[6, 2] as a subquandle. Hence, in fact, the conjecture\nabout this family follows from the conjecture about {C[6, 1], C[6, 2]} in the preceding remark.\nRemark 6.8 Also in contrast to Remark 6.6, there exists a virtual knot K (see, for example, [18])\nsuch that the numbers of colorings by C[6, 1] and C[6, 2] are distinct. A virtual knot K with the\nfollowing property was given in [5], Remark 4.6: K is 3-colorable, but does not have a non-trivial\ncoloring by C[6, 2]. Since C[6, 1] has R3 as a subquandle, this virtual knot K has a non-trivial\ncoloring by C[6, 1]. Hence the numbers of colorings by C[6, 1] and C[6, 2] are distinct for K. Thus\nwe might conjecture that for any pair of non-isomorphic Galkin quandles, there is a virtual knot\nwith different numbers of colorings.\n22\n\n\fRemark 6.9 For any finite Galkin quandle G(A, \u03c4 ), there is a knot K with a surjection \u03c0Q (K) \u2192\nG(A, \u03c4 ) from the fundamental quandle \u03c0Q (K). In fact, a connected sum of trefoil can be taken as\nK as follows (see, for example, [27] for connected sum).\nFirst we take a set of generators of G(A, \u03c4 ) as follows. Let A = Zn1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Znk , where k, n1 , . . . , nk\nare positive integers such that ni divides ni+1 for i = 1, . . . , k. Let S = {(x, ei ) | x \u2208 Z3 , i =\n0, . . . , k}, where e0 = 0 \u2208 A and ei \u2208 A (i = 1, . . . , k) is an elementary vector [0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0] \u2208\nZn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Znk with a single 1 at the i-th position. Note that Rn is generated by 0, 1 as 0 \u2217 1 = 2,\n1 \u2217 2 = 3, and inductively, i \u2217 (i + 1) = i + 2 for i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 2. Since {x} \u00d7 A is isomorphic to a\nproduct of dihedral quandles for each x \u2208 Z3 , S generates G(A, \u03c4 ).\nFor a 2-string braid \u03c313 whose closure is trefoil (see Figure 2), we note that if x 6= y \u2208 Z3 , then\nfor any a, b \u2208 A, the pair of colors (x, a), (y, b) \u2208 G(A, \u03c4 ) at top arcs extends to the bottom, i.e.,\nthe bottom arcs receive the same pair. This can be computed directly.\nFor copies of trefoil, we assign pairs [(0, e0 ), (x, ei )] as colors where x = 1, 2 and i = 0, . . . k, and\ntake connected sums on the portion of the arcs with the common color (0, e0 ). Further we take\npairs [(0, ej ), (1, e0 )] for j = 1, . . . , k, for example, and take connected sum on the arcs with the\ncommon color (1, e0 ), to obtain a connected sum of trefoil with all elements of S used as colors.\nSuch a coloring gives rise to a quandle homomorphism \u03c0Q (K) \u2192 G(A, \u03c4 ) whose image contains\ngenerators S, hence defines a surjective homomorphism.\n\nReferences\n[1] Andruskiewitsch, N.; Gra\u00f1a, M., From racks to pointed Hopf algebras, Adv. in Math., 178\n(2003), 177\u2013243.\n[2] Carter, J.S.; Elhamdadi, M.; Nikiforou, M.A.; Saito, M., Extensions of quandles and cocycle\nknot invariants, J. of Knot Theory and Ramifications, 12 (2003) 725\u2013738.\n[3] Carter, J.S.; Jelsovsky, D.; Kamada, S.; Langford, L.; Saito, M., Quandle cohomology and\nstate-sum invariants of knotted curves and surfaces, Trans.
