In the framework of a perturbed cosmological expansion, the dark\nspecies influence the visible matter by affecting both the\nexpansion rate, controlled by their average energy, and\nthe metric inhomogeneities, sourced by species' perturbations.\n\n\f2\nThe gravitational signatures of the perturbations are\nparticularly informative as they are sensitive to the internal (kinetic) properties of the dark species. These signatures are generally dissimilar for species with identical\nbackground energy and pressure but different dynamics\nof perturbations, e.g., for self-interacting particles, uncoupled particles, or classical fields [1\u20135]. Perturbations\nof dark species can affect the observed CMB and matter\npower spectra by an order of magnitude. For example,\nthe gravitational impact of dark matter perturbations\nsuppresses the CMB power at low multipoles l . 200 by\nup to a factor of 25 (Sec. V C).\nDespite the value and prominence of the gravitational\nimpact of perturbations, most of the existing descriptions\nof cosmological evolution are misleading in matching dynamics of perturbations in dark sectors to features in\nobservable distributions. One long-investigated source of\nambiguities and erroneous conclusions is the dependence\nof the apparent evolution of perturbations and the induced by them gravitational fields on the choice of spacetime coordinates (metric gauge), e.g. [6, 7]. Of course,\nthe CMB and large scale structure observables should\nbe identical in any gauge. However, in various gauges\nthe features of the observable distributions may appear\nto be generated in different cosmological epochs and by\ndifferent mechanisms.\nFor example, given the standard adiabatic initial conditions, the perturbation of the CMB temperature \u03b4T /T\ngrows monotonically on superhorizon scales in the historically important and still popular synchronous gauge,\ne.g. [8]; \u03b4T /T generally remains constant beyond the\nhorizon in a single cosmological epoch but changes during the transition to another epoch in the calculationally\nconvenient and intuitive Newtonian gauge, e.g. [9, 10];\nor, \u03b4T /T is strictly frozen beyond the horizon but evolves\ndifferently since horizon entry in the spatially flat gauge.\nThese descriptions naively suggest different separation\nof the presently measured CMB temperature anisotropy\ninto the inhomogeneities of primordial (inflationary) origin and those generated by the gravitational impact of\nperturbations in various species (CMB, neutrinos, dark\nmatter, dark energy, etc.)\nThe use of gauge-invariant perturbation variables1 [6,\n7, 11, 12] does not remove this ambiguity [13]. Indeed, the perturbations of species' density and velocity or the metric in any fixed gauge can be written as\ngauge-invariant expressions, which may be called \"gaugeinvariant\" (though, clearly, non-unique) definitions of\n\nthese perturbations [13]. Hence, the variety of gaugeinvariant perturbation variables is at least as large as the\nvariety of gauge-fixing methods.\nNevertheless, without contradicting general covariance, much of this descriptional ambiguity can be\navoided. We show that in cosmological applications the\nperturbed evolution can be described by variables whose\nchange is necessarily induced by a local physical cause.\nMoreover, when the equations of perturbation dynamics\nare presented in terms of such variables, the structure of\nthe equations simplifies considerably. The simpler equations allow tractable analytical analysis of perturbation\nevolution for realistic cosmological models.\nWe impose two requirements on a measure of dynamical cosmological perturbations:\nI. The dynamics of the measure is determined completely by locally identifiable physical phenomena\nwithin the local Hubble volume;\nII. The measure is universally applicable to all scales:\nfrom superhorizon (governed by general relativity)\nto subhorizon (governed by microscopic kinetics).\nThe goals of this paper are, first (Secs. II and III), to\nprovide a full dynamical description of cosmological inhomogeneities in terms of measures which satisfy these\ntwo requirements. Second (Secs. IV and V), to establish\nthe origin of features in the CMB angular spectrum, as\nrevealed by this more direct description, and to explore\nthe utility of these features for probing the dark sectors.\nMost of the best-known formalisms for the dynamics\nof CMB and matter inhomogeneities are formulated in\nterms of perturbations of physical observables, such as\nradiation temperature T (x\u03bc , n\u0302) or proper energy density \u03c1(x\u03bc ) [10, 14\u201317]. When these perturbations are\nevaluated in the Newtonian gauge, nonsingular on small\nscales, then the small-scale dynamics in these formalisms\ndoes reduce to special-relativistic kinetics and Newtonian\ngravity. Then, however, the perturbation evolution beyond the Hubble scale is nonlocal2 and subject to gauge\nartifacts. The artifacts are caused by the nonlocality of\ndefining the motion of coordinate observers, hence, inferring the components of tensors and the splitting of dynamical variables into their background values and perturbations from the gauge conditions. While some gauge\n\n2\n\nFor illustration, a perturbation of energy density \u03c1 in a dust (zero\npressure) universe evolves in the Newtonian gauge (26) as\n\u03b4\u03c1\u0307 + 3\n\n1\n\nA \"gauge-invariant perturbation variable\" generally cannot be\nmeasured by a local observer. (For example, the local values of\nthe gauge-invariant Bardeen potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8 [6] are determined by spacetime curvature outside the observer's past light\ncone.) Thus the gauge-invariant perturbations should be distinguished from gauge-invariant local observables or from local\nphysical tensor quantities, such as the energy-momentum tensor T \u03bc\u03bd or the curvature tensor R\u03bc\n\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nwith\n\n\u0227\n\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03c1\u2207i vi = 3\u03c1 \u03a6\u0307,\na\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0227 1\n1\ni\n\u03c1\n\u2207\nv\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2212\n3\n.\ni\n\u22072\na \u22072\nAlthough the first equation above is obtained by linearization\n2\nof a causal relation T 0\u03bc\n;\u03bc = 0, the operators 1/\u2207 in the second\nequation signal that after elimination of \u03a6 the evolution of \u03b4\u03c1\nbecomes nonlocal. This does not violate causality because \u03b4\u03c1\ncannot be measured locally.\n\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\n\n\f3\nconditions, e.g. synchronous, can be imposed locally, the\nresulting descriptions tend to be singular, contain gauge\nmodes, and fail to reduce to Newtonian gravity on small\nscales.\nStudies of the connection of the observed cosmological\ninhomogeneities to quantum fluctuations of an inflaton\nfield during inflation have led to an extensive list of variables which under certain conditions freeze (become constant in time) beyond the horizon. The best known examples are the Bardeen curvature \u03b6 [6, 18] (conventionally\ninterpreted either as a perturbation of intrinsic curvature on uniform-density hypersurfaces or as density perturbation on spatially flat hypersurfaces) and the curvature perturbation R on comoving hypersurfaces, e.g. [19].\nBoth \u03b6 and R are frozen for adiabatic superhorizon perturbations. For the general, nonadiabatic, superhorizon\nperturbations, the curvature perturbations \u03b6a [20] on the\nhypersurfaces of uniform energy density of an individual minimally coupled perfect fluid a were shown to be\nalso frozen (\"conserved\").3 Finally, perturbed cosmological evolution has been described in terms of conserved\nspatial gradients of various quantities [22\u201324]. The evolution of any of these variables is more robust to gauge\nartifacts on superhorizon scales than, for example, that of\n\u03b4T /T , \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1, or (the Bardeen) potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8 in the\nNewtonian gauge. However, neither the uniform-density,\nnor comoving, nor spatially flat hypersurfaces reduce to\nNewtonian hypersurfaces on subhorizon scales. Nor does\nthe evolution of gradients tend to the familiar picture of\nparticles and fields propagating in Minkowski spacetime.\nIn Sec. II we consider natural measures for nonlinear\nperturbations of phase-space distribution and radiation\nintensity and for linear perturbations of species' density\nthat conform to both requirements I and II. Moreover, we\nprove in Sec. II D that, although there is no \"physically\npreferred\" description of perturbed evolution, the overall change of density perturbations of any species during\nhorizon entry is the same in any description which satisfies certain conditions formalizing requirements I and II.\nThis change is different in most of the traditional formalisms, violating these requirements.\nIn Sec. III we describe a closed formulation of linear dynamics of scalar perturbations in terms of the\nabove measures evaluated in the Newtonian gauge. We\nfind that this formulation has several technical advantages, ultimately related to its tighter connection between the perturbation measures and the causality of\n\n3\n\nThe perturbations \u03b6a [20] are conserved for uncoupled perfect fluids [20] or species whose perturbations are internally adiabatic [4]\nonly if gravitational decays [21] of species into another type of\nspecies are negligible. This should be a reasonable assumption\nfor realistic applications to the evolution of the CMB and large\nscale structure.\n\nthe perturbed cosmological dynamics. The proposed approach has broad scope of applicability, providing an economical and physically adequate description of phenomena which involve inhomogeneous evolution of multiple\nspecies and non-negligible general-relativistic effects. Examples include the physics of inflation, reheating, the\nCMB, and cosmic structure. In this paper we focus on\nthe last two topics.\nAfter a concise review of the evolution of perturbations on superhorizon scales and during horizon entry in\nSec. IV, we apply in Sec. V the developed formalism to\nstudy the gravitational signatures of various species in\nCMB temperature anisotropy and large scale structure.\nContrary to a popular view, e.g. [17, 25\u201329], based on\nthe study of traditional proper perturbations in the Newtonian gauge, we find that CMB perturbations in the\nradiation era are not resonantly boosted by their selfgravity (Sec. V B 1). As a consequence, the gravitational\nsignatures of dark species in the radiation era, such as\nneutrinos or a dynamical scalar field (quintessence [30,\n31]), are moderate; as these species, even when they are\nabundant, do not untune any physical resonant amplification. Fortunately, due to low cosmic variance on the\ncorresponding scales and the existence of characteristic\nnondegenerate signatures (Sec. V B 2), we can still expect meaningful robust constraints on the nature of the\ndark radiation sector.\nOn the other hand, the gravitational impact of dark\nsectors' perturbations on the CMB in the matter era is\nfound to be an order of magnitude stronger than the\ntraditional interpretations suggest (Sec. V C).\nWe summarize our results in Sec. VI. Appendix A\npresents linear dynamical equations for scalar perturbations of typical cosmological species in terms of the suggested measures. Appendix B summarizes the formulas\nfor the scalar transfer functions and angular power spectra of CMB temperature and polarization.

If the particles interact\nonly gravitationally, their canonical momenta Pi coincide with the spatial covariant components of the particle 4-momenta P \u03bc : Pi = gi\u03bc P \u03bc , where g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric\ntensor. Then dxi/d\u03c4 = P i/P 0 , dPi/d\u03c4 is given by the\ngeodesic equation, and C, accounting for two-particle collisions, vanishes. Hence,\nP i \u2202f\ng\u03bc\u03bd,i P \u03bc P \u03bd \u2202f\nf \u0307 + 0\n+\n= 0.\nP \u2202xi\n2P 0\n\u2202Pi\n\n(2)\n\nWe stress that this equation and the following observation apply to the fully nonlinear general-relativistic dynamics.\nLet us consider the minimally coupled particles in\nthe perturbed spacetime, possibly populated by additional species. Let us also suppose that in certain coordinates the spatial scale, \u03bb, of inhomogeneities in the\nparticle distribution and in the metric is much larger\n\nthan the temporal scale of local cosmological expansion,\nd\nH\u22121 , where for nonlinear theory H \u2261 16 d\u03c4\nln(det gij ).\nThen from eq. (2), where both the second and third\nterms contain spatial gradients (\u2202f /\u2202xi and g\u03bc\u03bd,i ), we\nsee that f \u0307/f = O(\u03bb\u22121 ) \u226a H. In the limit of superhorizon inhomogeneities (\u03bbH \u2192 \u221e) the phase-space distribution f (\u03c4, xi , Pi ) of minimally coupled particles becomes time-independent (frozen). Then its background\nvalue, f \u0304, and perturbation, df \u2261 f (x\u03bc , Pi ) \u2212 f \u0304(P ), are\nalso frozen.\nConversely, an apparent temporal change of df (at\nfixed xi and Pi in any regular gauge) can always be\nattributed either to the gravity of physical inhomogeneities within the local Hubble volume or to local nongravitational interaction.\nThe majority of contemporary formalisms for cosmological evolution in phase-space, e.g. [10, 15, 17, 33, 34],\nwork not with the canonical momentum of particles Pi\n\n\f5\nbut rather with proper momentum p, measured by coordinate or by normal observers. These formalisms typically consider the phase-space distribution as a function\nof q \u2261 ap, the proper momentum rescaled by the background scale factor. The evolution of the corresponding perturbation \u03b4f (x\u03bc , q) \u2261 f (x\u03bc , q) \u2212 f \u0304(q), as well as\nof perturbations of integrated proper densities and intensities, depends on the nonlocal procedure for defining\nthe observer's frame from the gauge condition. In typical fixed gauges \u03b4f (x\u03bc , q), unlike df (x\u03bc , Pi ), generally\nchanges even in the absence of local physical inhomogeneity or local non-gravitational coupling.4\nThus the stated in the introduction criteria I and II\nfor a measure of cosmological inhomogeneities are fulfilled for a perturbation of one-particle phase-space distribution f (x\u03bc , Pi ), provided Pi are the particle canonical\nmomenta. A description in terms of phase-space distributions is, however, unnecessarily detailed for most cosmological applications. Instead, it is more convenient to use\nintegrated characteristics of the species, such as intensities (for radiation of photons or other ultrarelativistic\nspecies) or energy densities and momentum-averaged velocities (for arbitrary species, including non-relativistic\nparticles, fluids, or classical fields). In the next two subsections we discuss the general-relativistic measures of\nperturbations in intensity and density that also satisfy\ncriteria I and II.\n\nB.\n\nRadiation intensity\n\nWe start by considering inhomogeneities in the intensity of any type of cosmological radiation, such as CMB\nphotons or relic neutrinos at the redshifts at which the\nkinetic energy of the particles dominates their mass. We\ndescribe the direction of particle propagation by\nni \u2261\n\nPi\nP\n\nwhere\n\nP2 \u2261\n\n3\nX\n\nPi2 ,\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nmotivation for the noncovariant definitions (3) is to describe radiation transport in terms of variables which are\nfully specified by the \"dynamical\" quantity f (\u03c4, xi , Pi )\nbut are unmixed with the gauge-dependent and, in general, noncausally evolving metric g\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe energy-momentum tensor of radiation equals\nZ 3\nd Pi P \u03bc P\u03bd\n\u221a\nf.\n(5)\nT\u03bd\u03bc =\n\u2212g P 0\nSubstituting P\u03bc = n\u03bc P and P \u03bc = n\u03bc P , we can rewrite\nit as\nZ 2\nd ni n\u03bc n\u03bd\n\u221a\nT\u03bd\u03bc =\nI\n(6)\n\u2212g n0\n\u2013a directional average of an expression which depends\nonly on the local value of the metric and the quantity\nZ \u221e\nI(x\u03bc , ni ) \u2261\nP 3 dP f (x\u03bc , ni P ).\n(7)\n0\n\nThe variable (7), to be called the conformal intensity\nof radiation, inherits such useful properties of f (x\u03bc , Pi )\nas time-independence for superhorizon inhomogeneities\nof non-interacting particles and reduction to the proper\nintensity, dE/(dV d2 n\u0302), in the Minkowski limit.\nThe dynamics of I(x\u03bc , ni ) for minimally coupled radiation in a known metric is given by a closed equation [35] which is straightforwardly derived by integrating\nthe Boltzmann equation (2) over P 3 dP and remembering\nthat for the ultrarelativistic particles g \u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc n\u03bd = 0:5\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202I\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc \u2202I\n.\n(8)\n= n n g\u03bc\u03bd,i 2ni I \u2212\nn\n\u2202x\u03bc\n2 \u2202ni\nThis equation confirms that for decoupled particles which\nare perturbed only on superhorizon scales (the gradients\n\u2202I/\u2202xi and g\u03bc\u03bd,i are negligible) the conformal intensity\nfreezes: I \u0307 = 0.\nNow we can describe perturbation of the intensity by\na variable\n\nso that\n3\nX\n\nI\n\u03b9(x\u03bc , ni ) \u2261  \u0304 \u2212 1,\nI\nn2i = 1.\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nWe also introduce n0 \u2261 P0 /P (for the ultrarelativistic\nparticles g \u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc n\u03bd = 0) and n\u03bc \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd n\u03bd = P \u03bc /P . The\n\n4\n\nFor example, for linear perturbations in the Newtonian\ngauge (26), qi = Pi /(1 \u2212 \u03a8) [10, 17, 34]. Hence,\n\u03b4f (x\u03bc , q) = df (x\u03bc , Pi ) \u2212 \u03a8Pi\n\n\u2202 f \u0304\n.\n\u2202Pi\n\nWhile the first term on the right-hand side evolves causally on\nsuperhorizon scales, the Newtonian potential \u03a8 does not, and so,\nneither does \u03b4f (x\u03bc , q).\n\n(9)\n\nwhere I \u0304 is a time-independent background value of I. As\nintended, the perturbation \u03b9 is time-independent in full\n(nonlinear) general relativity for superhorizon perturbations of uncoupled radiation. This variable also reduces\n\n5\n\nIn the last terms of eqs. (8) and (10), the partial derivatives\nwith respect to the components of ni = Pi /P , constrained by\ncondition (4), can be naturally defined as\nX \u0012 P \u2202\u03bc\u03b1 \u0013 \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2261\n,\n\u2202ni\n\u2202Pi\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1\n\u03b1=1,2\nwhere \u03bc\u03b1 = (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) are any two independent variables parameterizing n\u0302.\n\n\f6\nto the perturbation of proper intensity in spatially homogeneous and isotropic, or Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW), metric. The full dynamical equation for \u03b9 evolution follows trivially from eq. (8):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2202\u03b9\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc \u2202\u03b9\n.\n= n n g\u03bc\u03bd,i 2ni (1 + \u03b9) \u2212\nn\n\u2202x\u03bc\n2 \u2202ni\n\n(10)\n\nThe value of the introduced intensity perturbation \u03b9\nis generally gauge-dependent. If spacetime is spatially\nhomogeneous and isotropic then the FRW metric is naturally preferred as the metric manifesting the spacetime\nsymmetries. In this metric \u03b9 is unambiguous and coincides with the perturbation of proper intensity. As\nshown next, the value of \u03b9 is also unambiguous for superhorizon perturbations: it is the same in any of the\ngauges which provide a nonsingular description of the\nsuperhorizon evolution. (More general arguments for the\nuniqueness of \"physically adequate\" mapping of superto subhorizon perturbations are given in Sec. II D.)\nUnder an infinitesimal change of coordinates x\u03bc \u2192\n\u03bc\nx\u0303 = x\u03bc + \u03b4x\u03bc the perturbation \u03b9 transforms as\n\u03b9\u0303(x\u0303\u03bc , \u00f1i ) = \u03b9(x\u03bc , ni ) \u2212 4ni n\u03bc \u03b4x\u03bc,i ,\n\n(12)\n\nSuppose that in at least some gauges the superhorizon\nevolution of cosmological perturbations appears nonsingular (regular). Namely, that in these gauges the perturbations of all the dynamical and metric variables Q have\na moderate magnitude |\u03b4| \u2261 |\u03b4Q/Q| . 1 and are homogeneous on the spatial scales less than \u03bb \u223c |\u03b4/\u03b4,i | \u226b H\u22121 .\nA transformation between two gauges either of which is\nregular, as defined here, has to be restricted as\n|\u03b4x\u03bc | . H\u22121\n\nand\n\n|\u03b4x\u03bc,i | . H\u22121 /\u03bb.\n\n(13)\n\nGiven these restrictions and the result \u2202\u03b9/\u2202x\u03bc = O(\u03bb\u22121 ),\nfollowing from them and from eq. (10), the values of ni\nand \u03b9 are unchanged by the gauge transformation (11)(12) in the superhorizon limit H\u22121 /\u03bb \u2192 0.6\nThe equations given so far applied to the full generalrelativistic dynamics. We conclude this subsection by\npresenting their linearized versions. We consider the perturbed FRW metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd = a2 (\u03c4 ) [\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc )] ,\n\n6\n\n\u03b9\u0307 + ni \u03b9,i = 2ni n\u0302\u03bc n\u0302\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd,i ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere n\u0302\u03bc \u2261 (1, ni ). The intensity perturbation \u03b9 determines linear perturbation of radiation coordinate density d, introduced in the next subsection, as [eq. (25)]\nd=\n\n3\nh\u03b9in\u0302 ,\n4\n\n(16)\n\nR\nwhere hin\u0302 denotes d2 ni /4\u03c0. Likewise, \u03b9 specifies normal\nbulk velocity of the radiation\nTi0\n,\n\u03c1+p\nP\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 \u2212T00 and p \u2261 i Tii /3, as\nvi \u2261\n\n3\nhni \u03b9in\u0302 ,\n4\nwhich follows from eq.

(10) are\n\n(14)\n\nMost of the gauge-dependent measures of perturbations vary in\nthe H\u22121 /\u03bb \u2192 0 limit even within the restricted class of regular gauges. For example, the metric perturbation \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd changes\nunder a restricted gauge transformation x\u0303\u03bc = x\u03bc + \u03b4x\u03bc , with\n\u22121 /\u03bb \u2192 0, by \u2212L g\n0\n0\n\u03bb\n|\u03b4x\u03bc\n\u03b4x \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212(g\u03bc\u03bb \u03b4\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc g\u03bb\u03bd )\u03b4 \u1e8b \u2212\n,i | . H\n0\n\u0121\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4x 6= 0.\n\nNext we consider a measure of perturbation of energy\ndensity for arbitrary species that, again, is directly connected to local physical dynamics and is universally applicable to all scales. While we lift all the restrictions\non the nature of the species, we limit our construction\nto the linear order of cosmological perturbation theory.\nFor the discussion of densities it is sufficient to address\nscalar perturbations and disregard uncoupled vector and\ntensor modes.\nSuppose that the studied, possibly self-interacting,\nspecies (labeled by a subscript a) do not couple nongravitationally to and are not created in significant\namount by gravitational decays of the remaining species.\nSuch species, to be called \"isolated\", can be assigned\na covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor Ta\u03bc\u03bd .\nIn an arbitrary gauge, the covariant energy conservation\nTa0\u03bc ;\u03bc = 0 in linear perturbation order gives\n\u03c1\u0307a \u03b4pa \u2212 \u1e57a \u03b4\u03c1a\n.\nd \u0307a + \u2202i va\u2032i =\n(\u03c1a + pa )2\n\n(19)\n\nHere we introduced coordinate number density perturbation of the species\n\u03b4\u03c1a\n+ 3D,\n(20)\n\u03c1a + p a\nP\nwhere D \u2261 61 \u03b4(det gij )/ det gij = 16 i hii is the spatial\ndilation of the metric (14), and coordinate bulk velocity\nof the species\nda \u2261\n\nva\u2032i \u2261\n\n\u2212Tai 0\n= va i \u2212 h0i .\n\u03c1a + p a\n\n(21)\n\nIf the species a are classical particles then va\u2032i gives\ntheir momentum-averaged velocity measured by coordinate observers, moving along the lines xi = const.\n\n\f7\nThe justification for calling da \"coordinate number\ndensity perturbation\" is the following. Consider isolated species which are described by an equation of state\np = p(\u03c1) and can be assigned a conserved number N .\nFor them, by energy conservation, \u03b4\u03c1/(\u03c1 + p) gives the\nrelative perturbation \u03b4npr /npr of species' proper number density npr = dN/dVpr . Then da equals the perturbation \u03b4ncoo /ncoo of species' coordinate number density ncoo = dN/d3 x, where the proper and coordinate infinitesimal volumes are related as dVpr = a3 (1 + 3D)d3 x.\nThe right-hand side of eq. (19) is a gauge-invariant\nquantity, proportional to the so called \"nonadiabatic\npressure\" \u03b4pa \u2212 (\u1e57a /\u03c1\u0307a )\u03b4\u03c1a . It vanishes trivially whenever pa is a unique function of \u03c1a . Even if pa and \u03c1a are\nnot functionally related, for example, if a is a field or a\nmixture of more basic interacting species, the right-hand\nside of eq. (19) vanishes whenever all the proper distributions describing the species a are unperturbed in certain\ncoordinates. Indeed, then \u03c1\u0307a \u03b4pa \u2212 \u1e57a \u03b4\u03c1a vanishes in those\ncoordinates and so, by its gauge invariance, vanishes in\nany coordinates. We will call the superhorizon perturbations of the species a which appear unperturbed on a\ncertain hypersurface internally adiabatic. We also note\nthat the right-hand side of eq. (19) can be measured by\na local observer, provided he accepts a background equation of state pa = pa (\u03c1a ) which defines the nature of the\nunperturbed species.\nAccording to eq. (19), the density perturbation da\nis frozen for superhorizon internally adiabatic perturbations of isolated species. This superhorizon conservation\ncan be easily understood for particles with a conserved\nnumber, when da is literally the perturbation of coordinate density of this number. As long as the chosen gauge\nis nonsingular in the superhorizon limit H\u22121 /\u03bb \u2192 0,\nthe particle number ncoo in a unit coordinate (but not\nproper!) volume changes infinitesimally over a time interval \u2206\u03c4 = H\u22121 , by \u2206ncoo /ncoo = \u2206\u03c4 \u2202i va\u2032i = O(H\u22121 /\u03bb).\nHence, da = \u03b4ncoo /ncoo remains frozen.\nSimilarly to the perturbation \u03b9 of radiation intensity, the coordinate density perturbation da is generally\ngauge-dependent. Yet, in the superhorizon limit its value\nin the regular gauges is also unambiguous. This is evident\nfrom the da transformation\nd \u0303a = da \u2212 \u03b4xi,i\n\u03bc\n\n(22)\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nunder a change of coordinates x\u0303 = x + \u03b4x , restricted\nfor the regular gauges by conditions (13).\nThe traditional measures of density perturbation such\nas the perturbations of proper density or 3-curvature are,\nlikewise, gauge-dependent. But, unlike da , those perturbations vary in the superhorizon limit even among the\nregular gauges. For example, a gauge transformation law\nga\n\u03b4\u03c1a\n\u03b4\u03c1\n=\n+ 3H\u03b4x0\n\u03c1a + p a\n\u03c1a + p a\n\n(23)\n\nshows that proper overdensities \u03b4\u03c1a /(\u03c1a + pa ) or \u03b4\u03c1a /\u03c1a\nremain gauge-dependent in the superhorizon limit among\nthe regular gauges, restricted by conditions (13).\n\nAs noted in Sec. I, the values of the gauge-variant density, curvature, or other perturbations in any fixed gauge\ndefine certain \"gauge-invariant\" perturbations [6, 7, 11,\n12], such as Bardeen's \u01eba or \u03b6 [6, 18]. The value of da\nin a fixed gauge also defines a gauge-invariant variable.\nIn particular, da of the Newtonian gauge (Sec. III) corresponds to the gauge-invariant expression (28).\nWe can simply relate the perturbation of the coordinate particle number density d with the discussed earlier perturbation of phase-space distribution df (x\u03bc , Pi )\nfor classical point particles and with perturbation of intensity \u03b9 for ultrarelativistic particles. As follows from\neqs. (20) and (5), in linear order,\nR 3\nd Pi E(P ) df\nd=\n,\n(24)\na4 (\u03c1 + p)\nwhere E(P ) \u2261 (P 2 + m2 a2 )1/2 . For ultrarelativistic particles this equation and eqs.

We\nshow next that the variable da remains useful on all scales\nand that the suggested by it relation between density perturbations on super- and subhorizon scales is uniquely\npreferable on physical grounds.\nD.\n\nUniqueness of superhorizon values\n\nVarious measures of scalar perturbations that freeze\nbeyond the horizon, for example, the uniform-density or\ncomoving curvatures \u03b6 [6, 18] or R [6, 7, 19] or the gradients of Refs. [23, 24], differ in their evolution on the scales\ncomparable to the horizon and smaller. Not all of these\nmeasures of perturbations remain meaningful in the subhorizon Minkowski limit. Those that do, e.g. the coordinate density perturbations da in various regular gauges,\nmay still differ from each other on scales comparable to\nthe Hubble scale.\nWe now prove that, nevertheless, the value of a superhorizon density perturbation is the same in terms of any\nmeasure which\nI\u2032 . Freezes for superhorizon internally adiabatic perturbations of uncoupled (isolated) species,\nand additionally,\nII\u2032 . Gives the perturbation of species' number density,\n\u03b4na /na \u2261 \u03b4\u03c1a /(\u03c1a + pa ), in any spatially homogeneous and isotropic (FRW) metric.\nCondition II\u2032 is a formal statement of our desire for a\nmeasure of density perturbation to be such on all scales\n\n\f8\nwhenever the concept of density perturbation is unambiguous (c.f. requirement II in Sec. I). We match the\nmeasure to \u03b4\u03c1a /(\u03c1a + pa ), rather than, e.g., to \u03b4\u03c1a /\u03c1a ,\nto be consistent with condition I\u2032 , which then applies automatically to an FRW metric. Finally, if the dynamics\nof the measure is fully specified by the physics within\nthe local Hubble volume (requirement I in Sec. I), then\nthe local dynamics of superhorizon perturbations should\nbe the same whether the metric is globally FRW or not.\nHence, we impose condition I\u2032 for the general metric.\n\nintroduced only as a gedanken experiment. They are not\nexpected to exist in nature.7\nThe above arguments do not imply that the measures da and d\u2032a are identical. For example, the coordinate number density perturbations (20) differ in different\ngauges, c.f. eq. (22). The identical are their values for superhorizon perturbations and, trivially, for unperturbed\ngeometry, when they all give \u03b4\u03c1a /(\u03c1a + pa ).\nIII.\n\nThe proof is applicable to arbitrary isolated species a.\nTo be specific, we consider a decelerating universe, where\nperturbations evolve from super- to subhorizon scales.\nWe imagine a cosmological scenario in which the initially\nperturbed geometry becomes homogeneous and isotropic\nwhile the studied scales \u03bb are superhorizon (\u03bb/H\u22121 \u226b 1)\nand remains homogeneous and isotropic ever since. We\nsuppose that the chosen gauge provides a regular description of superhorizon perturbations and leads to the FRW\nmetric in the unperturbed geometry. Let da and d\u2032a be\ntwo arbitrary measures that both are frozen on superhorizon scales and equal to \u03b4\u03c1a /(\u03c1a + pa ) in the FRW\nmetric. Since in our imaginary scenario the metric becomes FRW on superhorizon scales, da = d\u2032a at all times.\nIn particular, da = d\u2032a beyond the horizon. We now note\nthat if the measures describe an instantaneous state of\nthe perturbations then the equality da = d\u2032a retains its\nvalidity on superhorizon scales regardless of the subsequent perturbation evolution, i.e., regardless of the chosen cosmological scenario.\nTo conclude the proof, we demonstrate that the invoked imaginary scenario is physically realizable, however unnatural this realization may be. Given arbitrary\nsuperhorizon perturbations of the existing cosmological\nspecies and the metric, we can force them to evolve to a\nhomogeneous geometry by adding new minimally coupled\nspecies, X, which first contribute infinitesimally to the\noverall energy-momentum density. Let these imaginary\nspecies obey an equation of state wX \u2261 pX /\u03c1X = \u22121/3\nuntil they become the only dominant component. (The\nchoice w = \u22121/3 corresponds to the borderline between\ndeceleration and acceleration, hence, time-independent\n\u03bb/H\u22121 .) We set the coordinate number density perturbation dX of the species X to vanish on superhorizon\nscales, e.g., by our choice of the initial distribution of\nthese species. (This requirement is not dynamically natural. Yet, due to superhorizon conservation of dX , it is\nself-consistent and in principle realizable.) Then, once\nthe unperturbed species X dominate, they generate a\nhomogeneous and isotropic geometry. The subsequent\ncosmological expansion may be designed to decelerate\nagain, e.g., by taking wX at any \u03bb/H\u22121 equal w at the\nsame \u03bb/H\u22121 in the original model, without the species X.\nThen in the modified model the fictitious species X remain dominant and the geometry unperturbed, as desired. We stress that this scenario and the species X are\n\nDYNAMICS IN THE NEWTONIAN GAUGE\n\nAny convenient gauge can be used to study cosmological evolution. Nevertheless, of the most popular gauges,\nsuch as the synchronous, Newtonian, uniform density,\ncomoving, or spatially flat, only the Newtonian gauge\nreduces to Newtonian gravity on subhorizon scales. Because of this helpful feature, during our further discussion\nof scalar perturbations we impose the Newtonian gauge\nconditions, namely, require zero shift and shear of the\nmetric: gi0 \u2261 0 and gij \u221d \u03b4ij . For simplicity, we assume a spatially flat background geometry. Then the\nperturbed metric reads\nds2 = a2 (\u03c4 ) [\u2212(1 + 2\u03a6)d\u03c4 2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03a8)dx2 ] .\n\n(26)\n\n(It is not a priori obvious that the Newtonian gauge provides a nonsingular description of superhorizon scales.\nWe will return to this subtlety at the end of the section.)\nA.\n\nDensities\n\nIn the Newtonian gauge the coordinate number density\nperturbation (20) is\nda =\n\n\u03b4\u03c1a\n\u2212 3\u03a8,\n\u03c1a + p a\n\n(27)\n\nand the coordinate and normal bulk velocities of species\ncoincide: va\u2032i = vi a [eq.

However, on large,\ncompared to rG , scales \u03a8 is fully determined by the local coordinate overdensities and velocity potentials of the\nmatter species:\n\u03a8(r) = \u2212\n\nd\n\u03a8 \u2243 \u2212 \u2212 Hu\n3\n\n(for r \u226b rG ),\n\n(39)\n\nas follows from either eq. (38) or eq. (36). The corrections\nto relation (39) from matter inhomogeneities beyond the\ndistance rG are suppressed exponentially.\nThe presented dynamical equations for the coordinate measures of density and intensity perturbations\nhave three important advantages over the traditional\nNewtonian-gauge formalisms in terms of the proper measures, e.g. [10, 17]. First of all, by Sec. II, the evolution of\nthe coordinate, rather than proper, measures of perturbation is determined entirely by the physics within the\nlocal Hubble volume.\nThe second, related to the first, improvement of the\nformalism is the explicit Cauchy structure of the new\ndynamical equations in the Newtonian gauge. Indeed,\nthe traditional equations for the rate of change of proper\ndensity or intensity perturbations inevitably contain the\ntime derivative of \u03a8 [10, 15\u201317, 39]. Yet, by the generalized Poisson equation [c.f. eq. (40)], \u03a8\u0307 itself depends on\n\n\f10\nthe rate of change of the density and velocity perturbations of all the species. The terms \u03a8\u0307 or \u03a6\u0307 do not appear\nin the proposed equations.\nAnd the third benefit of quantifying density perturbation by d = \u03b4ncoo /ncoo is a nonsingular generalized Poisson equation for \u03a8, eq. (36). In terms of the traditional\nvariables,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4\u03c1\n2\n\u2207 \u03a8=\u03b3\n+ 3Hu .\n(40)\n\u03c1+p\nAs \u03c4 \u2192 0, the factor \u03b3, eq. (34), diverges as H2 \u223c 1/\u03c4 2 .\nFor the typical, e.g. inflationary, initial conditions this\ndivergence on superhorizon scales is counterbalanced by\n\u03b4\u03c1\na cancelation \u03c1+p\n+ 3Hu = O(\u03c4 2 ). The seemingly singular right-hand side of traditional eq. (40) may misguide\nan analytical analysis as well as cause significant numerical errors and instabilities due to incomplete cancelation\nof the singular contributions. The regularity of \u03a8 in the\nsuperhorizon limit, on the other hand, is natural from\neq. (36) for any conserved overdensities da . There is generally no large cancelation in the superhorizon limit of\neq. (36).\nWe now return to the question of whether the Newtonian gauge provides a nonsingular description of superhorizon perturbations. As proved in Ref. [40], for any reasonable cosmology there exist perturbation solutions for\nwhich species' overdensities, the product Hu, and gravitational potentials in the Newtonian gauge remain finite\nin the superhorizon limit. In addition, eq. (31) admits\nsingular solutions with u \u223c 1/a. One might discard the\nsingular modes on the grounds that if they are comparable to the regular ones when the perturbations exit\nthe horizon then the singular modes become negligible\nsoon after the exit. However, the solutions which appear singular in the Newtonian gauge could be produced\nby a physical mechanism whose description is singular in\nthe Newtonian but regular in a different gauge. Then\non superhorizon scales in the Newtonian gauge decaying\nsingular modes would appear to dominate frozen regular\nmodes.\nThis question cannot be resolved without taking into\naccount dynamical equations. For example, we can imagine regular perturbations in metric whose shear does not\nvanish (\u22072 \u01eb 6\u2192 0) in the superhorizon limit. The transformation of metric shear\n\u22072 \u01eb\u0303 = \u22072 \u01eb + \u03b4xi,i\n\n(41)\n\nunder a scalar gauge transformation shows that this metric requires a singular transformation to the Newtonian\ngauge, in which \u01eb(Newt) \u2261 0. The corresponding Newtonian perturbations may then turn out singular. Fortunately, we know that, at least, slow-roll inflationary\nscenarios lead to superhorizon perturbations which are\nnonsingular in the Newtonian gauge [9]. Therefore, given\nthe convenience of the Newtonian gauge, we use it for our\nanalysis of post-inflationary cosmological evolution.\n\nIV.\n\nOVERVIEW OF PERTURBATION\nEVOLUTION\nA.\n\nSuperhorizon evolution\n\nWe can identify three popular descriptions of perturbation evolution on superhorizon scales. Following tradition, the general superhorizon perturbation is often\nviewed as a superposition of adiabatic and isocurvature\nmodes, e.g. [41]. Adiabatic (also \"curvature\" or \"isentropic\") perturbations can be defined as perturbations\nfor which the internal (proper) characteristics of all the\nmatter species are uniform on some spatial slice. On this\nslice the metric remains perturbed. Isocurvature perturbations were idealistically considered to be the perturbations of the relative abundances of species while the total\nenergy density was assumed unperturbed and the geometry homogeneous and isotropic. It has been, however,\nrealized for two decades [42\u201346] that the decomposition\ninto adiabatic and isocurvature modes generally is not\ninvariant under cosmological evolution. Although an adiabatic perturbation preserves its nature on superhorizon\nscales [4, 40, 47], a perturbation which appears isocurvature at a particular time, generally fails to be such in just\na single e-folding of Hubble expansion. Despite this serious inconsistency, the picture of \"isocurvature modes\"\ncontinues to be influential, at least, in terminology.\nA different view of superhorizon evolution is given by\nthe \"separate universe\" picture, e.g. [34, 48, 49]. In\nit, each Hubble volume is considered as an independent\nFRW universe, characterized by its own expansion rate\nand curvature. This description is self-consistent, and it\nexplicitly exhibits the locality of superhorizon evolution.\nNevertheless, it requires to keep track of \"how far\" each\nregion has evolved in a global frame. The procedure for\nthe latter is well defined but its outcome is not intuitive\nwhen the perturbations are not adiabatic.\nMore recently, Wand et al. [20] noted that superhorizon evolution of several uncoupled fluids becomes trivial if inhomogeneity of a given fluid a is described by\nthe perturbation of spatial curvature on the hypersurfaces of constant \u03c1a . Neglecting gravitational decays of\nspecies [21], these curvature perturbations, \u03b6a , are individually conserved for uncoupled fluids even if the overall\nperturbation is not adiabatic. This approach lead to significant progress, e.g. [50, 51], in quantitative analysis of\nthe curvaton-type scenarios [42\u201346].\nThe formalism presented in Secs. II and III further facilitates the description of linear superhorizon evolution\nof multiple species as the common expansion of gravitationally decoupled inhomogeneities in the individual\nspecies. It shows that if the inhomogeneities are quantified by the perturbations of the coordinate number densities then their superhorizon freezing is explicit in any\nregular gauge. The conserved curvatures \u03b6a [20] are simply related to the coordinate density perturbations da in\n(Newt)\nthe Newtonian gauge, as \u03b6a = 31 da\n[comment a) after\neq. (29)]. The description in terms of da does not require\n\n\f11\nto specify the conserved perturbations of each fluid a on\na different set of hypersurfaces. This description retains\nits usefulness on all scales, including subhorizon.\nIf the superhorizon cosmological perturbations are adiabatic, as predicted by single-field inflation and favored\nby observations [52, 53], then the number density perturbations da of all the species are equal. This can be\nseen by evaluating the right-hand side of eq. (28) in the\ngauge in which all \u03b4\u03c1a vanish. The common value of da\nthen equals three times the perturbation of the uniformdensity slice curvature D, known as the Bardeen curvature \u03b6 [6, 18]: da = 3\u03b6. In other words, on superhorizon\nscales an arbitrary collection of adiabatically perturbed\nspecies is equivalent to a single fluid, having an equation of state p(\u03c1) = p\u0304(\u03c1\u0304) and frozen coordinate number\ndensity perturbation d = 3\u03b6.\nEven if the overall cosmological perturbations are not\nadiabatic, any species which do not interact with the\nother species and are perturbed internally adiabatically\n(i.e., are unperturbed on a certain spatial slice, on which\nthe other species may be perturbed) can be regarded as a\nsingle fluid, \"same\" in various regions beyond causal contact. Its density perturbation da is also frozen (Sec. II C).\nThe bulk peculiar velocities of species change with\ntime even on superhorizon scales. In general, the evolution of velocities differs for various species. However,\nif superhorizon perturbations are adiabatic then the last\ntwo terms in eq. (31) vanish. (These terms are gaugeinvariant and they apparently vanish for adiabatic perturbations in the uniform density gauge.) Then for a\nFourier perturbation mode with a wavevector k\n\u2202\n(aua ) = a[\u03a6 + O(k 2 /H2 )].\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(42)\n\nThus for adiabatic conditions the superhorizon acceleration of all the species is equal.\nB.\n\nHorizon entry\n\nWhen the perturbation scale becomes comparable to\nthe Hubble horizon (the perturbations \"enter the horizon\"), the contribution of velocity divergence to d \u0307a ,\neq. (19), becomes appreciable. The evolution of the velocities is affected by metric inhomogeneities and the latter are sourced by all the species which contribute to\n\u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd . Thus, during horizon entry all such species influence the evolution of all the density and velocity perturbations.\nAfter the entry, the perturbations of given species\nmay or may not continue affecting other species gravitationally. The criterion for perturbations to continue\nbeing gravitationally relevant is evident from eqs. (36)(37). On subhorizon scales these equations reduce to\n2\n2\n2\nthe Poisson\nP equation k \u03a6 \u2243 k \u03a8 \u2243 \u22124\u03c0Ga (\u03c1 + p) d =\n2\n\u22124\u03c0Ga\na (\u03c1a + pa )da . If for some species after the\nhorizon entry a2 (\u03c1a + pa )da decays, such as for relativistic species, then the species contribute negligibly to the\n\ngravitational potential. The gravitational impact of their\nperturbations can be ignored. On the other hand, if\na2 (\u03c1a + pa )da \u223c a2 \u03b4\u03c1a remains non-vanishing, such as\nfor CDM during the matter era, then these species source\nmetric perturbations and maintain their influence on the\nevolution of all cosmological species.\nV.\n\nFEATURES IN THE ANGULAR SPECTRUM\nOF THE CMB\nA.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nPrior to decoupling of photons from baryons at z \u223c\n1100, Fourier modes of photon overdensity evolve according to wave equation (A12) in Appendix A. We find it\nuseful to rewrite this equation as\nd \u0308\u03b3 +\n\nRb H\n1+Rb\n\nd \u0307\u03b3 + c2s k 2 (d\u03b3 \u2212 B) = 0,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere Rb = 3\u03c1b /(4\u03c1\u03b3 ), c2s = [3(1+Rb )]\u22121 gives the sound\nspeed in the photon-baryon plasma,\nB(\u03c4, k) \u2261 \u22123(\u03a6 + \u03a8 + Rb \u03a6),\n\n(44)\n\nand we continue to use the Newtonian gauge (26). According to eq. (43), in each mode the density perturbation d\u03b3 oscillates about its varying equilibrium\nvalue B(\u03c4, k).\nThe presently observed CMB perturbations are given\nby a line-of-sight solution [15] of the radiation transport\nequation (33) complemented by the Thomson collision\nterms [10, 14, 54], eq. (A13). Denoting the collision terms\nby CT , we have\n\u03b9\u0307\u03b3 + ni \u2207i \u03b9\u03b3 = \u22124ni \u2207i (\u03a6 + \u03a8) + CT .\n\n(45)\n\nOnce the evolution of the dynamical variables d\u03b3 , d\u03bd , dc ,\nu\u03b3 , etc. and the induced gravitational potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8\nare determined, the line-of-sight integration of the radiation transport equation (45) becomes more straightforward if the spatial derivatives of the potentials in eq.

However, their monopoles differ:\nh\u03b9\u03b3 in\u0302 = 34 d\u03b3 , eq. (16), while h\u03b9eff in\u0302 = 4\u0398eff , where the effective temperature perturbation \u0398eff [55\u201357] in our variables reads\n\u0398eff \u2261\n\n1\nd\u03b3 + \u03a6 + \u03a8.\n3\n\n(48)\n\n(In the traditional approach [56, 57], \u0398eff = \u03b4T (Newt)/T +\n\u03a6.) Physically, \u0398eff quantifies the present temperature\n\n\fperturbation of photon radiation which decoupled from\na stationary thermal region with photon overdensity d\u03b3\nand potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8, provided the potentials subsequently decayed adiabatically slowly over a time interval\n\u2206\u03c4 \u226b \u03bb \u2261 k \u22121 . Indeed, under the described conditions\n\u03b9eff is conserved along the line of sight by eq. (46).8\nThe appearance of the term \u03a6 + \u03a8, rather than the\ntraditional \u03a6, in eq. (48) should not be surprising. The\nsame sum \u03a6 + \u03a8 is also responsible for the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe [58] (ISW) corrections to the intensity in\nthe variable potential and for the deflection of photons\nby gravitational lensing.9\nThe full expression for the CMB temperature perturbation observed at the present time \u03c40 reads:\n\u2206T\n=\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c40\n\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\n1\ni\nij\nd\u03c4 \u0121 \u0398eff + ni vb + ni nj \u03a0p +\n4\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n+ g \u03a6\u0307 + \u03a8\u0307\n.\n(49)\n\u03c4, r(\u03c4 )\n\nIt follows from the line-of-sight integration [15] of eq.

The perturbations \u0398eff , vb , and \u03c0p are evaluated along the line of\nsight r(\u03c4 ) = (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )n\u0302, taking that the direction of \u2206T\nobservation is \u2212n\u0302 and at the observer's position r \u2261 0.\nThe complete formulas for the angular power spectra Cl\nof CMB temperature and polarization induced by the\nscalar perturbations are summarized in Appendix B.\nWe now proceed to connecting features in the angular\nspectrum of CMB temperature anisotropy to the internal\nnature of cosmological species. In Sec. V B we address\nthe scales which enter the horizon during radiation domination, and in Sec. V C the larger scales which enter\nduring matter and dark energy domination.\n\n8\n\n9\n\nThe variables \u03b9eff and \u0398eff are useful for constructing the CMB\nline-of-sight transfer functions [15] from known solutions for perturbation modes. Yet, these variables are not convenient as primary dynamical variables and should be avoided when studying\nperturbations' gravitational interaction. The evolution equations\nfor \u03b9eff and \u0398eff do not have an explicit Cauchy form and their\ndynamics does not satisfy condition I of Sec. I.\nOf the numerous existing formalisms for CMB dynamics in the\nNewtonian gauge, I am aware of only one [59, 60], by R. Durrer,\nin that the impact of metric perturbations on radiation temperature is described by \u03a6+\u03a8, as opposed to \u03a6. Durrer's variable for\nlinear perturbation of radiation intensity coincides with the linear limit of our intensity perturbation \u03b9, constructed in Sec. II B\nfor full theory. Yet, unlike the considered da , her density per(Newt)\nturbations Da = (1 + wa )da\ndo not freeze for superhorizon\nperturbations.\n\nPerturbation of CMB density\n\n12\nd\u03b3\n\n(Newt)\n\n(3/4)\u03b4\u03c1\u03b3\n3\u0398eff\n\n1\n\n/\u03c1\u03b3\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1/2\n\nk S(\u03c4) / \u03c0 with S(\u03c4)=\u03c4/3\n\nFIG. 1: The evolution of a Fourier mode of CMB density perturbation in the radiation era in terms of different measures:\nCoordinate number density perturbation d\u03b3 = \u03b4n\u03b3 coo /n\u03b3 coo\n(solid), proper density perturbation \u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 /\u03c1\u03b3 in the Newtonian\ngauge (dashed), and effective temperature perturbation \u0398eff ,\neq. (48), (green solid), all normalized to coincide on small\nscales.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nRadiation era\nRadiation driving?\n\nIt is often stated, e.g. [17, 25\u201329], that the CMB perturbations on the scales of a degree and smaller (l & 200)\nare significantly enhanced during the horizon entry in the\nradiation era. In a model without neutrinos, the claimed\nenhancement (\"radiation driving\") of CMB temperature\nperturbations is by a factor of 3, translating into a factor of 9 enhancement of the temperature autocorrelation\nspectrum. This conclusion is based on the apparent enhancements of both \u0398eff and \u03b4T /T in the Newtonian\ngauge during the entry (the solid green and dashed curves\nin Fig. 1). The enhancements are ascribed to a \"resonant\nboost\" of CMB perturbations by their own gravitational\npotential, whose decay soon after the horizon entry is\nsaid to be \"timed to leave the photon fluid maximally\ncompressed\" [28].\nHowever, in the concordance cosmological model as\nmuch as 41% of the energy density in the radiation era\nis carried by decoupled neutrinos. The evolution of freestreaming neutrinos and their contribution to metric inhomogeneities differs qualitatively [4] from the acoustic\ndynamics of the photon fluid. If without neutrinos the\nCMB perturbations were resonantly boosted by metric\ninhomogeneities, neutrinos should be expected to significantly untune the \"resonance\". In reality, neutrinos decrease subhorizon \u03b4T /T by as little as 10%, as\ncompared to subhorizon \u03b4T /T in a model with identical\ninflation-generated primordial perturbations but no neutrinos. Moreover, the addition of noticeable density of\nearly tracking quintessence [31, 61\u201363], whose perturbations evolve very dissimilar to the acoustic CMB perturbations (dashed vs solid lines in Fig. 2), not only fails to\ndestroy the \"resonance\" but instead enhances subhorizon \u03b4T /T (Fig. 3 a).\n\n\f13\n\nas follows from eqs. (A11) and (36). Hence, without\nneutrinos or early quintessence, the amplitude of subhorizon oscillations of photon overdensity, Amp[d\u03b3 ], exactly equals the primordial photon overdensity, d\u03b3 (\u03c4 \u2192\n0) = din . By Sec. II D, any other measure of photon perturbations d\u2032\u03b3 that satisfies conditions I and II coincides\nwith d\u03b3 on super- and subhorizon scales. Any such measure, therefore, would also detect no radiation driving:\nAmp[d\u2032\u03b3 ] = d\u2032\u03b3 (\u03c4 \u2192 0).10\nA formalism-independent distinction between physical\ndriving of perturbations and a gauge artifact can be made\nby comparing the studied model to a reference model in\nwhich the metric becomes homogeneous by reentry. In\nthe latter model any driving by metric inhomogeneities\nat reentry is objectively absent. A consistent procedure\nto achieve homogeneous geometry before reentry for any\ngiven primordial perturbations of arbitrary species was\ndescribed in Sec. II D. In the homogeneous (FRW) metric\nthe evolution of photon fluid overdensity readily follows\nfrom eq. (A12) with c2s = 1/3 as\nd(undriven)\n= din cos \u03c6.\n\u03b3\n\n(51)\n\nThus if in the superhorizon limit the photon and metric\nperturbations in the photon-dominated and \"undriven\"\nmodels are identical, after horizon entry the acoustic oscillations in the two models have equal amplitude. There\nis no causal mechanism for a gravitational boost of the\namplitude in the second model. Therefore, the amplitude should also not be considered boosted in the photondominated model.\nThe 3-fold increase of the Newtonian-gauge perturba(Newt)\ntion \u03b4T\u03b3\n/T\u03b3 = 13 d\u03b3 + \u03a8 in the second of the above\nmodels occurs when the metric becomes homogeneous\non superhorizon scales. This increase can hardly be attributed to a resonant boost of the acoustic oscillations\nfrom the decay of their gravitational potential at the\nmaximum photon compression, as stated in [28]. The\n(Newt)\nenhancement of the perturbation measure \u03b4T\u03b3\n/T\u03b3 is\npossible because its evolution is not determined only by\nlocal dynamics.\n\n10\n\nFor comparison, the perturbation of proper density in the Newtonian gauge is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(Newt)\n\u03b4T\u03b3\n\u03b4n\u03b3\n2 sin \u03c6\n2 cos \u03c6\n2 sin \u03c6\n=3\n= din\n\u2212 cos \u03c6 +\n\u2212\n.\nn\u03b3\nT\u03b3\n\u03c6\n\u03c62\n\u03c63\nFor it, Amp[\u03b4n\u03b3 /n\u03b3 ] = 3 lim\u03c4 \u21920 \u03b4n\u03b3 /n\u03b3 .\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bd\nCDM\nQ\nB \u2261 \u22123(\u03a6+\u03a8)\n\n0.2\n\nv = ku\n\na\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\na\n\nda\n\nWe argue that the apparent radiation driving of photon\ntemperature in the Newtonian gauge is a gauge artifact .\nFirst, the driving is absent when CMB density perturbations are quantified by the measure d\u03b3 , satisfying conditions I and II.

Fig. 2 b) shows the corresponding\nbulk velocities of the species. The plots describe the radiation epoch, dominated by photons and three standard\nflavors of neutrino. They are obtained by the numerical integration of eqs. (A1)-(A26) and (36)-(37) with\nthe regular adiabatic initial conditions, normalized to\nd(k/H \u2192 0) = 1. The chosen evolution parameter is a\ndimensionless phase\nof photon\n\u221a acoustic oscillations kS(\u03c4 )\nR\u03c4\nwhere S(\u03c4 ) \u2261 0 cs d\u03c4 = \u03c4 / 3 (for Rb \u226a 1) is the size of\nthe acoustic horizon.\nIn the description of the acoustic dynamics of the\nCMB by eq. (43), the gravitational impact of the species'\nperturbations is mediated through the \"restoring force\"\n\u2212c2s k 2 (d\u03b3 \u2212 B), with\nB(\u03c4, k) = \u22123(\u03a6 + \u03a8 + Rb \u03a6).\n\n(52)\n\nThe potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8 are sourced by perturbations of\ndensities, peculiar velocities, and anisotropic stress of the\nspecies as described by eqs. (36)-(37).\nFor typical cosmological species, the growth of subhorizon perturbations during the radiation era is insufficient for supporting a non-vanishing gravitational potential. Hence, the equilibrium photon overdensity B(\u03c4, k)\non subhorizon scales tends to zero. Thus in the radiation\nera the gravitational impact of perturbations is confined\nto horizon entry. As for the later subhorizon CMB oscillations, this impact can only rescale the oscillations' amplitude and additively shift the phase. We now consider\nthe gravitational impact on the CMB that is caused by\n\n\f14\ndecoupled relativistic neutrinos and a scalar field (early\nquintessence).\nAddition of extra ultrarelativistic neutrinos changes B\nas shown by the solid curve in Fig. 3 c). The increase\nof N\u03bd reduces B during the initial growth of d\u03b3 while\nenhances B for a significant period of d\u03b3 fall. The resulting modulation of the restoring force \u2212c2s k 2 (d\u03b3 \u2212 B)\nsomewhat damps d\u03b3 oscillation. The reduction of the\namplitude of CMB oscillations by neutrino perturbations [4, 25] is evident from the thin solid curve in\nFig. 3 a).\nOn the contrary, the density perturbation of canonical\ntracking quintessence [31, 61\u201363] is significantly reduced\nright after horizon entry [see the dashed line in Fig. 3 a).]\nThis reduction causes a prominent drop in B(\u03c4 ), shown\nby the dashed curve in Fig. 3 c), at the time when d \u0307a is\non average negative. As a result, the acoustic oscillations\ngain energy and their amplitude increases [64].\nThe qualitative difference in the evolution of density\nperturbations for quintessence versus the other considered species can be understood as follows. For the regular\nadiabatic initial conditions, the number density perturbations da of all the species are equal and the velocities\nvanish beyond the horizon (kS \u226a 1). Moreover, the\ninitial accelerations of all the species, eq. (42), are also\nequal, as confirmed by Fig. 2 b). However, the rate of\nchange of da at reentry is very sensitive to whether or\nnot pressure of the species is fully specified by their local\ndensity. If it is, such as for photons, CDM, and neutrinos, the \"nonadiabatic\" term on the right-hand side\nof eq. (19) vanishes. The corresponding da 's agree in\ntheir evolution up to O(k 4 \u03c4 4 ) corrections. On the other\nhand, for a classical field the nonadiabatic term becomes\nnon-zero during the entry [c.f. the first of eqs. (A26).]\nAs a consequence, quintessence density perturbation dQ\n[dashed line in Fig. 2 a)] noticeably deviates from the perturbations of the other species already in O(k 2 \u03c4 2 ) order.\nQuantitatively, a change of N\u03bd from 3 to 4 changes\nthe amplitude of d\u03b3 oscillations by \u22121.7%. Addition of\nequal energy in the form of tracking quintessence, on the\ncontrary, enhances the amplitude by 1.6%.\nPerturbations of CDM evolve according to eqs. (A1)\nas\nZ\nZ\ndc = \u2212 (\u2207i vci ) d\u03c4,\navci = \u2212 (a\u2207i \u03a6) d\u03c4. (53)\nThe impact of metric perturbations on CDM is thus determined by a normalized quantity \u2212(a/aent )\u03a6, where\naent \u2261 a|k\u03c4 =1 . Fig. 3 d) shows how this quantity\nis affected by the addition of extra neutrinos and\nquintessence. By comparing Fig. 3 b) and Fig. 3 a), we\nsee that the signs of the gravitational impact of perturbations in either neutrinos [4, 25] or quintessence [65] on\nthe power of CDM are opposite to the signs of the impact\nof these species on the acoustic amplitude of the CMB.\nThus on the scales entering the horizon before matterradiation equality (l & 200, k & 10\u22122 Mpc\u22121 ) the ratio\n\nof CMB to CDM powers, which is insensitive to the unknown primordial power of cosmological perturbations, is\nslightly decreased by decoupled particles. On the other\nhand, this ratio is increased by tracking quintessence.\nThe gravitational impact of perturbations on the phase\nof CMB oscillations is easier to analyze in real space [66\u2013\n69]. The phase shift, along with all the other characteristics of subhorizon oscillations, is fully specified by the\nsingularity of the CMB Green's function at the acoustic horizon [4]. An analysis of this singularity [4] shows\nthat for adiabatic initial conditions the phase is affected\nonly by the perturbations which propagate faster than\nthe acoustic speed of the photon fluid.\nPerturbations of both ultrarelativistic neutrinos and\nquintessence propagate at the speed\n\u221a of light c, i.e., faster\nthan the acoustic speed cs \u2264 c/ 3. The phase shift\ninduced by neutrinos displaces all the CMB peaks in\nthe temperature and E-polarization spectra by an about\nequal multipole number [4]\n\u2206l\u03bd \u2248 \u221257\n\n\u03c1\u03bd\n.\n\u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u03bd\n\n(54)\n\nThe three standard types of neutrino give \u2206l3\u03bd \u2248 \u221223,\nlarge enough to be observable with the present data [70\u2013\n76]. One additional fully populated type of relativistic\nneutrino increases the shift by [4] \u2206l+\u03bd \u2243 \u22123.4. According to numerical integration of eqs. (A1)-(A26) and (36)(37), the same additional radiation density (\u2206Neff = +1)\nin tracking quintessence leads to an almost triple shift\n\u2206lQ \u2243 \u221211.\nWhile in a formal treatment of Boltzmann hierarchy for the perturbations of free-streaming neutrinos,\ne.g. [77], the anisotropic stress might appear to be the primary cause of their characteristic gravitational imprints,\nthis conclusion is misleading. For example, anisotropic\nstress of minimally coupled tracking quintessence, whose\nperturbations also change the amplitude and phase of\nacoustic oscillations, is identically zero. In particular,\na real space approach [4] shows that for adiabatic perturbations the phase is shifted if and only if some perturbations physically propagate faster than the acoustic\nspeed cs .\nC.\n1.\n\nMatter era\n\n25-fold Sachs-Wolfe suppression\n\nIn the epoch dominated by pressureless CDM and\nbaryons which have decoupled from the CMB, metric\nperturbations (gravitational potentials) do not decay on\nsubhorizon scales. Through the finite potentials, matter\ncontinues to influence CMB long after horizon entry.

The quantity (57) is a natural measure of the intrinsic CMB temperature perturbation on superhorizon\nscales. This is the perturbation to be always observed\nfor the decoupled CMB photons if the metric becomes\nhomogeneous on superhorizon scales and remains such\nduring the subsequent evolution.\nIf the initial conditions are adiabatic (Sachs-Wolfe\ncase) then, by eq.

Thus\nthe classical Sachs-Wolfe result \u2206T /T = \u03a6/3 [58] is due\nto a partial cancellation of the primordial CMB density\nperturbation \u03b4T /T |in = \u2212 35 \u03a6 against the gravitational\nredshift 2\u03a6 in proportion \u22125 : 6.

The relation \u2206T /T = \u03a6/3 is usually\ninterpreted as a partial cancellation between the \"intrinsic\" temperature anisotropy \u03b4T (Newt)/T |in = \u2212 23 \u03a6 and\nthe gravitational redshift \u03a6 [26, 28, 39, 57]:\n\u03b4T (Newt)\n\u2206T\n=\nT\nT\n\n+\u03a6\nin\n\n(misleading!)

However, dc and the matter-induced potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8 may be partly smoothed early during\nthe horizon entry by non-standard dynamics of the dark\nsector. In the limiting case of a perfectly homogeneous\nmetric since very early time, we recover the unsuppressed\nCMB oscillations, with the amplitude d\u03b3, in in overdensity\nand \u2206T /T = \u03b4T /T |in = \u22125 \u2206T /T |adiab in temperature.\n2.\n\nImplications\n\nThe observed CMB multipoles with l . 200 are primarily generated by the perturbation modes which enter\nthe horizon during the matter era. These modes evolve\nin a static potential of collapsing CDM and baryons. The\npotential suppresses the corresponding Cl 's by an order\nof magnitude, see the solid curve in Fig. 5 for the \"concordance\" \u039bCDM model [76, 79\u201381].\nThe suppression is somewhat reduced for l . 10 because of the modes which enter the horizon when dark\nenergy becomes dominant and the potential decays. For\nthese modes the enhancement of CMB power is fully described by the ISW term \u03a6\u0307 + \u03a8\u0307, eq. (49). In general,\nhowever, the reduction of the 25-fold Sachs-Wolfe suppression is not equivalent to the ISW enhancement. An\nextreme example is the scenario in which \u03a6 + \u03a8 vanishes\n\n0.6\n\n\u039bCDM\nQDM\n\u039bCDM, dc= 0\n\n0.4\n\nl(l+1)CTT\nl\n\nLet us present two examples where such quasi-Newtonian\nconsiderations lead to wrong expectations.\nOne example is a classical scenario of \"isocurvature\"\ninitial conditions, e.g., from a phase transition early in\nthe radiation era, when \u03c1\u03b3 \u226b \u03c1c . If immediately after the\nphase transition \u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 + \u03b4\u03c1c = 0 then |\u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 /\u03c1\u03b3 | \u226a |\u03b4\u03c1c /\u03c1c |.\nFor a fixed magnitude of cosmological inhomogeneities\n|\u03b4\u03c1c /\u03c1c | \u223c 10\u22125 , the primordial photon perturbations\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 /\u03c1\u03b3 can then be ignored. However, it would be\nwrong to conclude that \u03b4T (Newt) /T |in = 0 and that from\neq. (58), due to the gravitational redshift in the matter\nera, \u2206T /T |isoc = \u03a6 (incorrect!). The correct answer is\n\u2206T /T |isoc = 2\u03a6, in agreement with eq. (56) where now\n\u03b4T /T |in = 0.\nAnother example where the interpretation (58) misleads is the opposite case of non-zero \u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 /\u03c1\u03b3 but homogeneous and isotropic geometry in the matter era. If\nthe primordial perturbations of radiation in this scenario\nare identical to the perturbations in the adiabatic model\nthen the interpretation (58) suggests that now, when\nthe \"2-fold\" suppression by \u03a6 is absent, \u2206T /T |\u03a6=0 =\n\u22122 \u2206T /T |adiab (incorrect!).

Given equal primordial perturbations, the observed CMB power Cl in this scenario\nexceeds the Sachs-Wolfe power by 25 times, although in\nboth scenarios the ISW effect is absent.\nMore realistically, the density perturbation da of some\nof the dominant species in the matter era may grow\nslower than [a2 (\u03c1+p)]\u22121 \u223c 1/H2 \u223c \u03c4 2 . Then, by eq. (36),\nthese species contribute only decaying terms to the gravitational potentials. This diminishes the suppression of\nthe CMB power at l . 200. As an illustration, the upper\nsolid and dashed curves in Fig. 4 a) show d\u03b3 in a CDMdominated universe (Sachs-Wolfe case) and in a model\nwhere the energy density of the dark sector is split equally\nbetween CDM and quintessence whose background density tracks CDM. In the second model the CMB temperature perturbations on subhorizon scales are larger\nby 93%.11\nThus any physics which reduces metric inhomogeneities in the matter era strongly influences CMB temperature anisotropy. Some of the influence may be due\nto a different ISW effect from the temporal change of the\ngravitational potentials. It can also be due to reduced\ngravitational lensing of the CMB, appearing in the second perturbative order. However, the most prominent\nimpact is caused by the very reduction of the potentials,\nsuppressing the auto-correlation of CMB temperature by\na factor of 25.\n\n11\n\nIf in the matter era some of the dominant species do not cluster,\nthe gravity-driven growth of CDM inhomogeneities also significantly weakens. This is seen distinctly in Fig. 4 b). A classical\nexample of such species is baryons prior to their decoupling from\nthe CMB, e.g. Ref. [25].\n\n\f17\nTwo examples are shown in Fig. 5. The figure displays\nthe CMB temperature power spectra Cl obtained with a\nmodified cmbfast code [15] for three models which differ\nonly by the dynamics of perturbations in the dark sectors. The solid curve describes the concordance \u039bCDM\nmodel [76, 79\u201381]. The dashed curve refers to a model\nwhere the dark sector is composed entirely of a classical\ncanonical scalar field Q. In this model at every redshift\nthe field background density \u03c1Q (z) is chosen to equal the\ncombined CDM and vacuum densities \u03c1c (z) + \u03c1\u039b of the\n\u039bCDM model. However, since the field perturbations\ndo not grow, the metric inhomogeneities of the second\nmodel decay after the horizon entry in the matter era.\nAs a result, its CMB power for l . 200 is enhanced.\nThe last, dash-dotted, curve in Fig. 5 describes a model\nwhich has the matter content of the concordance \u039bCDM\nmodel. However, while in the previous two scenarios the\ninitial conditions were adiabatic, here CDM density perturbation dc is set to zero on superhorizon scales (the\ninitial values for d\u03b3 , d\u03bd , and db are unchanged). Then,\nagain, the metric inhomogeneities in the matter era are\nreduced. While this model has the least ISW effect, the\nsmoother metric causes the largest enhancement of the\nCMB power among the compared models for l . 200.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere is a variety of descriptions of inhomogeneous\ncosmological evolution which are apparently dissimilar\non the scales exceeding the Hubble scale. To single out\nthe descriptions least afflicted by gauge artifacts, we suggest considering the measures of perturbations that meet\nthe following criteria: I. The measure's dynamics is determined entirely by the physics within the local Hubble volume. II. The measure is practically applicable in\nMinkowski limit and retains its physical meaning in any\nFRW geometry on all scales.\nWe showed (Sec. II A) that in the fully nonlinear theory these criteria are fulfilled for a perturbation of oneparticle phase-space distribution f (x\u03bc , Pi ), considered as\na function of particle canonical momenta Pi . The often used perturbations of f (x\u03bc , p) or f (x\u03bc , q), where p\nis the proper momentum and q \u2261 ap, do not satisfy requirement I. Perturbed nonlinear dynamics of radiation\ncan be appropriately described by the intensity perturbation \u03b9(x\u03bc , ni ), constructed by integration of f (x\u03bc , Pi ),\neqs. (7) and (9). Finally, a description of perturbed linear dynamics of arbitrary species satisfies criteria I and II\nif the perturbations are quantified by coordinate number\ndensity perturbations d = \u03b4ncoo /ncoo , eq. (20). In linear\ntheory these measures of perturbations in phase-space\ndistribution, intensity, and density are interrelated with\neqs. (24) and (25).\nSimilarly to the traditional proper measures of perturbations, e.g. \u2206T (n\u0302)/T and \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1, the proposed \"coordinate\" measures \u03b9(ni ) and d = \u03b4ncoo /ncoo are gaugedependent. Yet the gauge dependence of the proposed,\n\nbut not traditional, measures disappears in the superhorizon limit. More generally, we prove that on superhorizon scales the values of the density perturbations are\nthe same in terms of any measure satisfying the formal\nversions of criteria I and II, namely, conditions I\u2032 and II\u2032\non page 7.\nIn the Newtonian gauge (26) the suggested variables\nprovide additional technical advantages. One is the\nexplicit Cauchy structure of the dynamical equations\n(eq. (19), Sec. III B, and Appendix A). Another is a\nnonsingular superhorizon limit of the generalized gravitational Poisson equation (Sec. III C). Analytical solutions in the new formulation inevitably appear more\ntractable [4]. As an example, compare the solutions for\ndensity perturbations in the photon-dominated model,\neq. (50) versus the traditional solution in Footnote 10.\nIn the proposed class of formalisms, classical linear\ndensity perturbations of individual species manifestly\ndecouple gravitationally on superhorizon scales. This\nview of linear superhorizon evolution of multiple species\n(Sec. IV A) agrees with the picture provided by the conserved curvatures of Wands et al. [20]. The density perturbations of the species recouple during the horizon entry (Sec. IV B).\nOn the other hand, our description reveals a different\nfrom the traditionally assumed origin of several prominent features in the angular power of CMB temperature Cl . First of all, the apparent \"resonant boost\" of\nCMB perturbations for l & 200, presumably by their\nself-gravity during the horizon entry in the radiation\nera [17, 25\u201329], is found to be a gauge artifact of the\nNewtonian gauge. We demonstrated (Sec.V B 1) that the\ndriving is absent when density perturbations are quantified by any measure satisfying conditions I\u2032 and II\u2032 .\nWe showed (Sec. V B 1) that the \"radiation driving\"\npicture leads to incorrect expectations for the observed\nCMB signatures of dark species. Since the resonant selfboost of CMB perturbations does not physically exist\nand cannot be untuned by the gravitational influence of\nnon-photon species present in the radiation era with nonnegligible densities, the CMB signatures of such species\nare not anomalously amplified. This corrected expectation is confirmed by calculations for decoupled relativistic neutrinos and for tracking quintessence (Ref. [4] and\nSec. V B 2).\nA moderate impact of such species on the CMB power\nat small scales, less affected by cosmic variance, nevertheless already allows meaningful constraints on the species'\nabundance and nature, Refs. [70\u201377]. The constraints\nwill significantly improve in the near future [4, 82, 83],\nwhen the smaller angular scales become resolved.\nNotably, the CMB is sensitive to the propagation velocity of small-scale inhomogeneities in the dark sectors [2]. For neutrinos, quintessence, and any other\nspecies for which this velocity\n\u221a exceeds the sound speed\nin the photon fluid cs \u2248 c/ 3, the perturbations cause a\nnondegenerate uniform shift of the acoustic peaks [4, 84].\n\n\f18\nThe CMB power is also sensitive to nonadiabatic pressure, generally developing for a classical field. As discussed in Sec. V B 2, under adiabatic initial conditions,\nthe nonadiabatic pressure affects the evolution of species'\noverdensities already at the order O(k 2 \u03c4 2 ) while the regular pressure enters only at O(k 4 \u03c4 4 ). In the example\nof tracking quintessence, nonadiabatic pressure causes\nearly suppression of quintessence density perturbations\n(Sec. V B 2 and Fig. 2). This enhances the CMB power\nwhile neutrino perturbations reduce it (Fig. 3).\nAlthough CMB perturbations are not resonantly\nboosted on small scales, the CMB multipoles with l .\n200 are significantly suppressed by the gravitational potential which does not decay after the horizon entry in the\nmatter era. The contribution of the perturbations which\nenter the horizon when |\u03b4p/\u03b4\u03c1| \u226a 1 and the potential is\ntime-independent, to the angular power of CMB temperature is suppressed by 25 times (Sec. V C 1). The suppression is thus much more prominent than a factor of 4\nreduction of the CMB power in the conventional interpretations [26, 28, 39, 57] of the Sachs-Wolfe effect [58].12\nAs a consequence, any mechanism which smoothes\nmetric inhomogeneity after radiation-matter equality at\nredshift z \u223c 3500 significantly enhances CMB anisotropy\n(Sec. V C 2). Examples of such mechanisms are a noticeable fraction of quintessence at all post-equality redshifts,\ninteraction or unification of dark matter and dark energy, e.g. [30, 86\u201389], or alternative explanations for the\napparent signatures of nonbaryonic matter, e.g. MONDinspired theory of gravity [90].13 The enhancement is\naccounted for by the ISW effect when the metric is\nsmoothed after CMB last scattering at z \u223c 1100. However, even if the ISW effect is absent, but the metric at or\nbefore CMB last scattering is already smoother than in\nthe standard scenario, the enhancement exists. Thus the\nexperimentally evident suppression of CMB multipoles\nwith l . 200 severely constrains the mechanisms which\n\n12\n\n13\n\nreduce metric perturbations at any time in the matter\nera.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work greatly benefited from the suggestions of\nE.

We use the Newtonian\ngauge (26), in which the gravitational potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8\nare determined by the perturbations of the total density,\nvelocity, and anisotropic stress with eqs. (36)-(37).\n\n1.\n\nCold dark matter (CDM)\n\nBefore CDM streams cross, in particular, in the linear regime, CDM is equivalent to a fluid with vanishing\npressure and vanishing anisotropic stress (pc = \u03b4pc = 0,\n\u03c3c = 0). Then from eqs. (19) and (31)\nd \u0307c = \u22072 uc ,\n\nu\u0307c = \u2212Huc + \u03a6.\n\n(A1)\n\nElimination of uc gives a single second-order equation for\nCDM density perturbation\nThe CDM-induced suppression of the CMB power at low l's is\ncomplimentary to another characteristic impact of dark matter\npotential on the CMB known as \"baryon drag\" or \"baryon loading\" [25, 39]. The baryon loading is the enhancement of the\nodd acoustic peaks in Cl relative to the even ones due to the\nshift of the zero of \u0398eff oscillations by \u2212Rb \u03a6, eqs. (48) and (44).\nThe alternation of the peak heights is generally absent in CDMfree models, e.g. [85]. While the suppression of Cl at low l's\nis controled entirely by the metric inhomogeneity \u03a6, the baryon\nloading is, in addition, proportional to baryon density \u03c1b \u221d \u03a9b h2 .\nAfter the first appearance of this work (astro-ph/0405157) the\npredicted enhancement of CMB power spectrum at low l's for\nthe Bekenstein TeVeS [90] implementation of MOND [91] has\nbeen observed in a numerical analysis of Skordis et al. [92]. The\nauthors of this analysis, nevertheless, ascribe the enhancement\nentirely to the ISW effect. This interpretation is generally incorrect. If by CMB last scattering the metric is perturbed less\nthan in the standard \u039bCDM model, the ISW effect in the models\nwith enhanced CMB power may be smaller than in the standard\nmodel.\n\nd \u0308c + Hd \u0307c = \u22072 \u03a6.\n2.\n\nNeutrinos\n\na.\n\nGeneral case\n\n(A2)\n\nWhen the universe cools below 1 MeV, weak interactions of the standard neutrinos become cosmologically irrelevant. Then the full evolution of neutrino phase-space\ndistribution f is governed by collisionless Boltzmann\nequation (2). Straightforward linearization of eq. (2)\nshows that the scalar component of f perturbation\ndf (xi , Pi ) \u2261 f (xi , Pi ) \u2212 f \u0304(P )\n\n(A3)\n\n\f19\nevolves in the linear order in the Newtonian gauge (26)\nas\n\u0001\n\u2202f \u0304\nVi \u2207i \u03a6 + V 2 \u03a8 ,\n(df )* + Vi \u2207i (df ) = E\n\u2202E\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere E \u2261 (P 2 + m2 a2 )1/2 and Vi \u2261 Pi /E.\nThe initial conditions for the perturbation df on superhorizon scales can be determined as follows. Consider\nspatial hypersurfaces of constant radiation density \u03c1r\nand, to be specific, assume that neutrino chemical potential is unperturbed. Then prior to neutrino decoupling\nthe neutrino phase-space distribution fpr (ppr ) in proper\nvariables d3 xpr d3 ppr is spatially uniform (independent\nof xi ) on a hypersurface \u03c1r = const. In a gauge of uniform\nradiation density and zero shear, in which \u03c1r = const defines the hypersurfaces of constant time and the 3-metric\nis gij = a2 (1 + 2\u03b6r )\u03b4ij , the proper and canonical neutrino\nmomenta are related as pipr = Pi /[a(1 + \u03b6r )]. Thus in the\nvariables (xi , Pi )\n\u0012\n\u0013\nPi\nf (xi , Pi ) = fpr\n.\n(A5)\na[1 + \u03b6r (xi )]\n(We used that d3 xpr d3 ppr = d3 xi d3 Pi .) The corresponding linear perturbation of f (xi , Pi ) is\ndf = \u2212P\n\n\u2202 f \u0304(P )\n\u03b6r (xi ).\n\u2202P\n\n(A6)\n\nNote that substitution of the last result in eq. (24) or\nintegration of eq. (A5) over d3 Pi returns d\u03bd = 3\u03b6r .\nSince f (xi , Pi ) is a 4-scalar and for the decoupled particles f \u0304(P ) is time-independent, df is a gauge invariant.\nTherefore, eq. (A6) gives the initial conditions for df evolution in any gauge, including the Newtonian.\nb.\n\nUltrarelativistic limit\n\nPerturbation of the intensity of ultrarelativistic neutrinos is conveniently described by the variable \u03b9(x\u03bc , ni ),\nintroduced by eq. (9). After neutrino decoupling, the full\nand the linear evolution of neutrino intensity perturbation is given by eqs. (10) and (15) respectively.

In contrast to the\npreviously considered species, the pressure of a classical\nfield is not a local function of the field energy density.
