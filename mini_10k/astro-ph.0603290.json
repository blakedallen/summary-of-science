Since there is\na well-established correlation between NNa I and NHI (Ferlet et al. 1985; Bowen et al. 1995),\nNa i absorption, which has been observed extensively in the Galaxy, holds the potential to\nestimate NH I for individual clouds in DLAs, which usually cannot be precisely measured\nbecause of heavy blending of H i absorption. Moreover, the column density ratio of Na i to\nCa ii provides a useful indicator of the degree of dust depletion of ISM clouds (e.g., Welsh et\nal. 1990; Crawford 1992; Bertin et al. 1993; Sembach et al. 1994; Price et al. 2001; Crawford\net al. 2002) because sodium is hardly depleted from gas onto dust, while calcium can be\nheavily depleted (Savage & Sembach 1996).\nThe main absorption lines of Na i are the optical \u03bb\u03bb 5891, 5897 D doublet and the\nultraviolet \u03bb\u03bb 3303.3, 3303.9 doublet. Observations exploiting the Na i D doublet hold the\ngreater promise for comprehensive studies using Na i due to two important advantages:\n1\n\nBased on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(1) the oscillator strength of the Na i D transitions are \u223c 70 times greater than the Na i\nUV transitions (Morton 2003), and (2) Na i D absorption rarely overlaps with other metal\nabsorption lines because the wavelengths of the Na i D doublet are significantly redder than\nmost of other metal lines. Thus, Na i UV doublets can be detected only in the highest column\ndensity systems toward the brightest QSO. Weak Na i absorption systems are more likely to\nbe detected with the Na i D doublet. However, observations of Na i D in high-redshift DLAs\nrequire near-infrared high resolution spectroscopy because the rest-frame optical wavelengths\nare redshifted into the near-infrared. The advent of high sensitivity and high resolution\nspectroscopy in the near-infrared with 8-meter class telescopes has enabled us to undertake\nsuch observations (e.g., Kobayashi et al. 2002, 2003, 2005).\nAs a first trial for detecting Na i D absorption lines at high redshift (z > 1), we observed\nthe extremely bright zem = 3.911 gravitationally-lensed QSO \"APM 08279+5255\" (Irwin et\nal. 1998). There are two dominant gravitationally-lensed images, \"A\" and \"B,\" with a\nseparation of 0.\u2032\u2032 38 and flux ratio of fB /fA = 0.77 (Ibata et al. 1999). A third faint image,\n\"C\", was also reported by Ibata et al. between A and B, with a separation of A - C =\n0.\u2032\u2032 15 and flux ratio fC /fA = 0.18. Petitjean et al. (2000) reported probable faint Na i UV\ndoublet absorption associated with the zabs = 1.062 and 1.181 DLAs in optical HIRES (Vogt\net al. 1994) spectra obtained by Ellison et al. (1999a,b). For both systems, Petitjean et al.\nconcluded (1) log NHI \u223c 21, (2) metallicity 0.3 \u2212 1.0 Z\u2299 , (3) dust-to-metal ratio about half\nthat of the Galaxy, and (4) a temperature of \u223cfew hundred Kelvin.\nIn this paper, we present near-infrared 1.18 -1.35 \u03bcm spectra of APM 08279+5255 with\na resolution of about 50 km s\u22121 . The spectra were obtained with the InfraRed Camera\nand Spectrograph (IRCS) using the adaptive optics (AO) system at the Japanese Subaru\nTelescope. The AO improved the FWHM of both images A and B such that the spectra of\nA and B were marginally separated. However, we combined the spectra of images A and\nB in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and to compare our results with those by\nPetitjean et al. (2000). We will publish A-B separated spectra elsewhere. This paper is\nstructured as follows: In \u00a72, we describe the IRCS observations and data reduction of APM\n08279+5255. In \u00a73, we present the Na i D absorption lines and the fitting results for the\nzabs = 1.062, 1.173, 1.181 systems. We discuss our results and conclusions in \u00a74.\n\n2.\n\nObservation & Data Reduction\n\nNear-infrared 1.18-1.35 \u03bcm spectra of APM 08279+5255 were obtained on 2001 December 25 UT, during the scientific commissioning run of the IRCS instrument. IRCS is\na cassegrain mounted 0.9-5.5 \u03bcm near-infrared camera and spectrograph (Tokunaga et al.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n1998; Kobayashi et al. 2000) with an AO system (Takami et al. 2004) on the 8.2m Subaru\nTelescope (Iye et al. 2004) located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\nThe Subaru AO system uses a curvature wave front sensor with 36 control elements\nto compensate for a disturbed wavefront due to the earth's atmosphere. For an R \u223c 11\nwavefront reference star under excellent observing conditions, the AO provides a stellar\nimage with a Strehl ratio of \u223c 0.04 and a FWHM of \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 07 in the J-band (1.25 \u03bcm). The\nperformance degrades with fainter reference stars. For these observations, we used APM\n08279+5255 itself (R \u223c 15.6) as the wavefront reference star. We achieved a FWHM of 0.\u2032\u2032 2\nin the J-band, which is much narrower than (0.\u2032\u2032 5\u22120.\u2032\u2032 6) for typical seeing conditions at the\nSubaru Telescope.\nWe used the cross-dispersed Echelle mode of the IRCS, which provides a spectral resolution of 15 km s\u22121 (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 20000) with a 0.\u2032\u2032 15 slit. The pixel scale is 0.\u2032\u2032 075 (\u223c 7.5 km s\u22121 ) per\npixel across the slit and 0.\u2032\u2032 060 per pixel along the slilt. The entire J -band (1.18 \u2212 1.35 \u03bcm)\nwas covered simultaneously in one IRCS exposure, with the cross-disperser in order 5 and\nthe echelle in orders 42-48. Although the FWHM of the images were good throughout the\nobserving time (about 0.\u2032\u2032 2-0.\u2032\u2032 5 in the J-band), we used a wider slit (0.\u2032\u2032 6) to maximize throughput. Thus, the spectral resolution was determined by the average image size \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 5, and the\nresulting spectral resolution was \u223c 50 km s\u22121 (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 6000) in the observed wavelength\nrange.\nThe slit length was 3.\u2032\u2032 8, and the position angle was set to 32\u25e6 so that both the lensed\nimages A and B are in the slit. The telescope pointing was nodded along the slit by about 2\u2032\u2032\nfor each 600s exposure for sky-background and dark subtraction. Because of the fine pixel\nscale needed for AO images and the high spectral resolution, it is impossible to reach the\nbackground limit in 600s exposures, which are required to be less than the time variation of\nthe sky OH emission. Eight sets of data were obtained, resulting in a total exposure time of\n9600s. Spectra of bright telluric standard stars (HD 92728: A0Vs) at similar air mass were\nobtained in a similar fashion.\nAll the data were reduced following standard procedures using the IRAF2 noao.imred.echelle\npackage, including sky subtraction (subtraction of two frames), flat-fielding (halogen lamp\nwith an integrating sphere), and aperture extraction. Argon lamp spectra that were taken at\nthe end of the observing night were used for vacuum wavelength calibration. A Heliocentric\ncorrection of 9.64 km s\u22121 was applied to the vacuum wavelength calibrated spectra.\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nIn Figure 1, we present the 1.18 \u2212 1.35 \u03bcm spectrum of APM 08279+5255. The raw\nspectrum was smoothed with a 3 pixel (\u223c 20 km s\u22121 ) boxcar function for presentation. Na i\nD absorption lines from the zabs = 1.062 and 1.181 DLAs are clearly seen. Several velocity\ncomponents can be seen in the Na i D absorption lines from the zabs = 1.181 DLA. Additionally Na i D absorption lines associated with the zabs = 1.173 Mg ii system (Petitjean et al.\n2000) are detected. This doublet absorption line was identified as Na i D lines because other\nmetal lines of other absorption systems listed in Ellison et al. (1999a,b) cannot account for\nthese two absorption features.\nWe fit Voigt profiles to the Na i D absorption features assuming the component velocities\nidentified by Petitjean et al. (2000) from metal absorption lines in the optical spectra by\nEllison et al. (1999a,b). The column density, Doppler width, and redshift of each component\nwere evaluated using VPGUESS3 and VPFIT4 (Carswell et al. 1987). We fit two components\nfor the zabs = 1.062 system and five for the zabs = 1.181 system. The absorption profiles\nare dominated by the instrument profile, which is almost identical to the Gaussian width\nFWHM \u223c 50 km s\u22121 .\nFor the zabs = 1.173 system, there is no a priori information on velocity components\nunlike the other systems. Also, there are several adjacent hot pixels on the right side of the\nNa i 5897 absorption line, which makes the fitting with multi velocity components difficult.\nThose hot pixels were difficult to remove because of their proximity to the Na i absorption\nline (see the feature labeled with \u00d7 mark in Figure 4). Because of the above reasons, we\nperformed only one component VPFIT (almost equivalent to a simple Gaussian fitting) for\nthis system. The hot pixel regions were ignored for the fitting. In view of the statistical noise\nthat can be estimated by point-to-point fluctuations on the continuum, the single component\nfitting is almost satisfactory.\nThe fitting results are summarized in Table 1. Figures 2,3,4 show the velocity profiles\nand fitting results for the Na i D lines. Using atmospheric absorption lines in the object\nand standard spectra, we confirmed that the pixel shift along the dispersion direction was\nless than 1 pixel throughout the observing time. Therefore the systematic uncertainty of the\nvelocity is less than 7.5 km s\u22121 . Although the column densities and the Doppler widths could\n3\n\nVPGUESS\nis\na\ngraphical\nhttp://www.eso.org/ \u0303jliske/vpguess/\n4\n\ninterface\n\nVPFIT\nis\na\nVoigt\nprofile\nfitting\nhttp://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/ \u0303rfc/vpfit.html\n\nto\npackage\n\nVPFIT\nprovided\n\nwritten\nby\n\nby\n\nJochen\n\nRobert\n\nF.\n\nLiske,\nCarswell,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nnot be directly determined because of insufficient instrumental spectral resolution, they can\nalso be constrained by the doublet ratio [i.e., equivalent width ratio W (5891)/W (5897)].\nAs the doublet ratio approaches unity, uncertainty in column density increases because the\ncolumn density and Doppler width become degenerate for a fixed equivalent width.\nBecause the physical distance (\u223c 1 kpc) between A and B at z \u223c 1 is much larger than\nthe typical spatial scale of Na i clouds in our Galaxy (a few tens to several thousands AU e.g.,\nPrice et al. 2001), the images A and B are most likely covered unequally. This introduces an\nadditional systematic uncertainty in the inferred properties of the Na i clouds. An estimation\nof the systematic uncertainty depends on the saturation level of the Na i absorption lines\nin the A+B combined spectrum. It can range from \u223c0.3 dex for a moderately saturated\ncase to \u223c 1 dex for a heavily saturated case. The estimated systematic uncertainty for each\ncomponent is shown in Table 1.\nBecause the resolution of the optical spectrum is higher than our near-infrared spectrum, the estimated redshift of each component by Petitjean et al. (2000) should be more\naccurate than ours. Hereafter, we use the velocities reported by Petitjean et al. (2000)\nfor our discussion of each component, except for the newly identified components from our\nspectrum.\n\n3.1.\n\nDLA at zabs = 1.062\n\nIn this system, we found two Na i components at +53 and +108 km s\u22121 , which we\nidentify as the components at +55 and +120 km s\u22121 by Petitjean et al. (2000). While\nPetitjean et al. found Na i component only at the +55 km s\u22121 , we newly identified Na i\ncomponent at the +120 km s\u22121 . The estimated column densities are log NNaI = 12.9 and 11.7,\nrespectively. These are consistent with Petitjean et al., who detected the former component\nwith the similar column density, but not the latter component to an upper-limit of log NNaI <\n12.8.\n\n3.2.\n\nDLA at zabs = 1.181\n\nIn this system, we found five Na i components. We identified the three components at\n\u221299, \u221275, and +48 km s\u22121 as the components at \u2212105, \u221280, and +40 km s\u22121 reported by\nPetitjean et al. (2000). While Petitjean et al. found Na i component only at the \u221280 km s\u22121 ,\nwe newly identified Na i components at the \u2212105, and +40 km s\u22121 . We identified further two\nnew Na i components at +4, and +101 km s\u22121 , which were not identified in Petitjean et al\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nprobably due to contamination by other absorption lines. The estimated column density of\nthe \u221280 km s\u22121 component is log NNaI = 12.5, which is not consistent with Petitjean et al.\nHowever, our evaluation of the column density of \u221280 km s\u22121 component is not so robust\nbecause Mg i \u03bb2852 absorption associated with an Mg ii absorption system at zabs = 3.502\n(Kondo et al. in preparation) overlaps with the Na i D \u03bb5891. The estimated column density\nof the \u2212105 km s\u22121 component is log NNaI = 12.0, which is consistent with the upper-limit\nof log NNaI < 12.4 found by Petitjean et al.\n\n3.3.\n\nMg ii system at zabs = 1.173\n\nIn this system, we found a Na i component at +204 km s\u22121 . Petitjean et al. (2000)\ndid not find any metal absorption lines at this velocity. The detected Na i absorption line\nprobably arises in a cloud that was previously not in front of the quasar at this velocity.\nWe discuss the detail of this newly identified component in \u00a74.2. We could not detect Na i\nabsorption lines associated with the four components around 0 km s\u22121 reported by Petitjean\net al., probably because of their low Na i column density.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nH i Column Densities of Each Velocity Component\n\nFollowing Petitjean et al. (2000), we estimated NHI for all components using the empirical relationship, log NHI = 0.688 log NNaI + 12.16 (11.6 < log NNaI < 13.4) (Sembach et\nal. 1993; Diplas & Savage 1994; Bowen et al. 1995) established for the Galactic interstellar\nabsorption clouds. In Table 2, we summarize our results for NHI . While this empirical relationship does not hold for log NNaI < 11 (Welty et al. 1994; Wakker & Mathis 2000; Wakker\n2001) nor for log NNaI > 12.9 (Ferlet et al. 1985), the column densities of all the detected\ncomponents are within the appropriate range of this relationship. The estimated NHI in\nvarious components, however, is subject to systematic uncertainties related to the following\nissues:\n1. Low metallicity\nIt is likely that the column density ratio NNaI /NHI is in proportion to the metallicity.\nVladilo et al. (1993) found that the column density ratio in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) decreases in proportion to the metallicity (\u223c 0.3 Z\u2299 , Peimbert et al. 1974; Pagel\net al. 1977). Because the metallicities of the zabs = 1.062 and 1.181 DLAs are estimated\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nto be in the range of 0.3 \u2212 1.0 Z\u2299 (Petitjean et al. 2000), it is appropriate to interpret\nthe estimated NHI in these systems as lower-limits.\n2. Contamination from a metal absorption line of other redshift\nWe could not evaluate the reliable column density of the \u221280 km s\u22121 component in\nthe zabs = 1.181 system because Mg i \u03bb2852 absorption associated with a strong\nMg ii system at zabs = 3.502 (Kondo et al. in preparation) is blended with the Na i D\n\u03bb 5891 absorption. Assuming the correlation, log NMgI /NMgII = \u22120.73 log NMgII + 7.6\n(Churchill et al. 2003b) and the same Doppler width (b = 13.7 km s\u22121 ) as the Mg ii\nabsorption lines, we estimated the equivalent width of the Mg i \u03bb2852 absorption. The\nH i column density of this component was estimated after removing this contamination from Mg i, and this introduced systematic uncertainty. Even after removing the\ncontamination, there still is another large uncertainty, because the resultant doublet\nratio of the Na i absorption lines is close to unity.\n3. Coverage of gravitationally-lensed images A and B\nAs stated above, it is likely that the Na i clouds do not equally cover the gravitationallylensed images A and B. Thus, the estimated Na i column density is uncertain as\ndescribed in \u00a73. The estimated NHI varies accordingly.\nWhile Petitjean et al. (2000) suggested that there are 40 and 20 small clouds in the\nzabs = 1.062, and 1.181 systems, respectively, our results show that there are at least 2 and\n5 high column density clouds in each system. Most interestingly, we find that each cloud in\nthe zabs = 1.181 system has a H i column density that is classified as a DLA. This is the\nfirst indication of an absorber in which the individual clouds are each of such high column\ndensity. This is in contrast to the findings of Churchill et al. (2003a), who constrained the\nsize of DLA clouds be less than 25 pc in the lensed QSO 0957+561A,B and inferred that\nonly one of the clouds gave rise to the DLA H i column density. This would suggest that\nthe zabs = 1.181 DLA, having log NHI \u223c 21.2, may be probing a very massive and large\nunderlying structure (see, for example, Turnshek et al. 2004).\n\n4.2.\n\nDetection of a New DLAs at zabs = 1.173: Proper Motion of a cloud of a\nfew 100 AU?\n\nWe detected a new component at +204 km s\u22121 associated with the zabs = 1.173 Mg ii\nabsorption system. Based upon scaling from the high Na i column density, this system is\nprobably a DLA rather than a Lyman-limit Mg ii system (Petitjean et al. 2000). Therefore,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthis system might contribute to the gravitational-lensing of the QSO, together with the other\nthree DLAs, at zabs = 1.062, 1.181, and 2.974, as suggested by Petitjean et al. Despite the\nlarge Na i column density, Petitjean et al. did not identify any metal lines for this velocity\ncomponent in the optical Keck spectrum. Similarly, in a subsequent search, we also could\nnot identify any Mg ii, Mg i, and Ca ii absorption lines for this component in the HIRES\nspectrum5 (see Figure 4).\nBecause there is a time-span of 3.6 years between our observation and the optical observation in the local-frame, or \u223c1.7 years in the rest-frame (zabs = 1.173) considering the effect\nof cosmological time dilation by a factor of (1 + zabs )\u22121 , it is probable that the newly identified cloud appeared in the line of sight toward the QSO within that time-span. If the cloud\nis moving in a tangential direction in the sky with a velocity of \u223c 400 km s\u22121 , the travel\ndistance is \u223c 200 AU in \u223c1.7 years in the rest-frame. The assumed velocity is comparable to\nthe combined velocity of the motion of cloud in high-redshift galaxies (\u223c 50 to \u223c 260 km s\u22121 ,\nErb et al. 2003) and the proper motion of field galaxies which should be smaller than the\ntypical velocity dispersion of the cluster of galaxies (e.g., between \u223c 500 and \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 ,\nGal & Lubin 2004). This sets the upper-limit of the cloud size and it is consistent with the\nsize of the Na i clouds in the Galaxy, which ranges from a few to several thousands AU\n(e.g., Meyer et al. 1996; Meyer & Lauroesch 1999; Welty & Fitzpatrick 2001; Andrews et al.\n2001; Lauroesch et. al. 2000, 2003). Our result shows that we can catch the very small-scale\nstructures of the cold (\u223c 100 K) neutral gas component in high-z QSO absorption systems\nwith time variation of Na i absorption features. The observable spatial scale with this technique is much smaller than that with the observation of gravitationally-lensed QSOs (see\ndiscussion in Ellison et al. 2004).\n\n4.3.\n\nDust Depletion and Chemical Uniformity in DLAs\n\nThe column density ratio NNaI /NCaII has often been used as a good indicator of the\ndegree of dust depletion because sodium is hardly depleted from gas onto dust grains while\ncalcium can be heavily depleted (Savage & Sembach 1996). In Table 3, we list the ratio\nNNaI /NCaII of each component. NCaII for the +120 km s\u22121 component at zabs = 1.062 and\nfor the \u2212105 and \u221280 km s\u22121 components at zabs = 1.181 are taken from Petitjean et al.\n(2000), while those for the +4, +40, and +101 km s\u22121 components at zabs = 1.181 were\n5\n\nftp://ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk/pub/papers/APM08279\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nevaluated6 using archived optical spectra (Ellison et al. 1999a,b).\nWe estimated the 3\u03c3 upper-limit of NCaII for the +4, and +101 km s\u22121 components at\nzabs = 1.181, because no Ca ii absorption line was detected in the optical spectra. In Figure\n4, we show a log [NNaI /NCaII ] \u2013 log NNaI plot for the DLAs as well as Na i clouds in the\nGalaxy (Vallerga et al. 1993) and in the LMC (Vladilo et al. 1993).\nWe found that log [NNaI /NCaII ] in these DLAs is systematically smaller than those in the\nGalaxy but similar to those in the LMC (Welty et al. 1999), suggesting that dust depletion\nis generally smaller in a lower metallicity environment. Our results are consistent with the\nresults of Vladilo (1998), who shown that dust-to-metal ratios of DLAs are similar to that\nof the LMC but smaller than that of the Galaxy, using the column density ratio of zinc to\nchromium.\nIt is also interesting to consider the uniformity in the NNaI /NCaII ratio across the \u223c 200\nkm s velocity spread of the zabs = 1.181 DLA. As presented in Table 3, it would appear that\nthe ratios are consistent with being uniform with component velocity, though there is large\nuncertainty in this statement. If so, this is consistent with the findings of Prochaska (2003a)\nand Churchill et al. (2003a), who reported uniform column density ratios as a function of\nvelocity in DLAs. It is also found by Churchill et al. that the uniformity is spatial, at least\non the scale of 200 pc. If the NNaI /NCaII ratio is more\u2013or\u2013less constant across the profiles\nin the zabs = 1.181 DLA, it would suggest that the chemical, ionization, and dust depletion\nlevels are uniform across the clouds.\n\u22121\n\n4.4.\n\nThe zabs = 1.181 System: Cold Dense Gas Clouds near the Center of a\nGalaxy ?\n\nAll five components of the zabs = 1.181 system have log [NNaI /NCaII ] > 0, which is a\ncharacteristic of cold dense gas in the Galaxy (known as the \"the Routly-Spitzer effect\",\ne.g., Routly & Spitzer 1952; Vallerga et al. 1993; Sembach et al. 1994). Because there are\nfive cold dense and very high column density clouds for the zabs = 1.181 system, we suggest\nthat the line of sight may be passing near the center of the host galaxy. The relatively high\nmetallicity of this system (0.3\u22121.0 Z\u2299 , Petitjean et al. 2000) compared to that typical of z\u223c1\nDLAs (\u223c 0.1 Z\u2299 , Prochaska et al. 2003b) also supports the above idea, because the metallicity\n6\n\nWe evaluated Ca ii column density for those systems using VPFIT. We evaluated Ca ii column densities also for the +120 km s\u22121 component at zabs = 1.062 and the \u2212105, and \u221280 km s\u22121 components at\nzabs = 1.181 and confirmed that our fitting results are consistent with those estimated by Petitjean et al.\n(2000).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nof DLA absorption is higher in the inner region galaxies because of a metallicity gradient\n(Chen et al. 2005). Therefore, the host galaxy of this system might be the most significant\ncontributor to the gravitational-lens among four DLAs toward APM 08279+5255. Note that\nsome DLAs were observed to have an impact parameter larger than 65 kpc (Churchill et al.\n2005) and above argument should be taken with caution.\nWe are grateful to all of the IRCS and AO team members and the Subaru Telescope\nobserving staffs for their efforts, which made it possible to obtain these data. We are also\ngrateful to Ellison et al. for making their excellent data available in the Internet and to\nJochen Liske for kindly answering our questions about VPGUESS. We thank the National\nAstronomical Observatory of Japan for their financial support and encouragement for the\nconstruction of the IRCS and AO.

Vertical axis is normalized flux to the continuum level and horizontal axis\nis local-frame wavelength in both panels. The spectrum was smoothed with a 3 pixel\n(\u223c 20 km s\u22121 ) boxcar function. Longer lines indicate Na i D \u03bb5891, while shorter lines\nindicate Na i D \u03bb5897. The left spectrum is noisier than the right one because the Na i D\nabsorption lines at zabs = 1.062 were located on the edge of the detector where the detector noise is significantly larger. The bottom panel shows the telluric absorption spectrum\ncalculated with ATRAN package software (Lord 1992).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Velocity profile of metal lines in zabs = 1.062 system. Horizontal axis shows the\nheliocentric velocity from z=1.06230. Vertical axis is normalized flux to the continuum level.\nTop two panels show the velocity profiles of Na i D \u03bb\u03bb5891, 5897 absorption lines obtained\nwith IRCS with the velocity resolution of \u223c 50 km s\u22121 . Bottom four panels show the velocity\nprofile of Na i \u03bb3303.9, Ca ii \u03bb3934, Mg ii, \u03bb2803 and Ti ii \u03bb3242 absorption lines obtained\nwith HIRES with the velocity resolution of \u223c 8 km s\u22121 . Vertical dashed lines mark the\nvelocity components found by Petitjean et al. (2000). The blue line shows the Na i velocity\ncomponent which has been detected with Na i \u03bb\u03bb3303.3, 3303.9 (Petitjean et al. 2000) and\nthe red line shows the newly detected Na i velocity component determined from the VPFIT\nprogram, which was also seen in the Ca ii, Mg ii, and Ti ii line profiles. Gray lines show the\nsum of all components. In the HIRES spectra, unmarked absorption lines are either from\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Velocity profile of metal lines in the zabs = 1.18 system. Notations are same\nas those in Figure 2.

Vertical dashed lines mark velocity components (V = \u2212105, \u221280, +40 km s\u22121 ) found by Petitjean et al. (2000) and those\n(V = +4, +101 km s\u22121 ) newly found with Na i D data.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Velocity profile of metal lines form zabs = 1.173 system. Notation are same\nas those in Figure 2. Horizontal axis shows the heliocentric velocity from z=1.1727.\nBottom three panels show the velocity profiles of Ca ii \u03bb3934, Mg ii \u03bb2803 and\nMg i \u03bb2852 absorption lines obtained with HIRES. Vertical dashed lines mark velocity components (V = \u221220, 0, +35, +50 km s\u22121 ) found by Petitjean et al. (2000) and those\n(V = +204 km s\u22121 ) newly found with Na i D data. Spurious features labeled with \u00d7 mark\non the right side of \u03bb5897 absorption are due to hot pixels.

A red circle shows our DLA data for zabs = 1.062. Black and blue points\nshow the data for our Galaxy (Vallerga et al. 1993) and the LMC (Vladilo et al. 1993) ,\nrespectively. The uncertainty of those data is less than 20%. Red filled square shows the\ndata for the V = \u221280 km s\u22121 velocity component at zabs = 1.181, whose uncertainty is not\nshown because it could not be accurately estimated due to the accidental overlap of the\nzabs = 3.502 Mg i absorption line (see main text).\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
