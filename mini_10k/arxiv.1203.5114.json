Intermetallic iron-based systems with the ThCr2 Si2\n\"122\" structure and doped with transition metal (TM)\nsubstitution on the iron site remain the most widely studied due to the feasibility of synthesizing large single-phase\ncrystals coupled with the ability to substitute a plethora\nof TM elements for iron. With superconductivity induced\nby substuting almost any of the TM elements in the Fe,\nCo, and Ni columns, the robustness of these superconductors to disorder \u2013 in particular, disorder focused directly\nin the active pairing layer \u2013 provides a striking constrast\nto the sensitivity found in other unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, this robustness initiated one\nof the early challenges to the proposed s\u00b1 sign-changing\ngap symmetry [2], and has been toted as evidence for a\nnon-sign-changing s-wave pairing symmetry [3].\nThe role of TM substitution in both promoting a superconducting state and shaping the phase diagrams of\nthe 122 systems is an important topic of ongoing debate.\nIn the Ba-based 122 systems, the substitution-induced\npositioning of the superconducting phase scale reasonably well with d-electron count (with the exception of Cu\nsubstitution) [4], and ample evidence of modifications to\nband structure, carrier concentrations and magnetic interactions support a rigid band shift doping model [1].\nHowever, theoretical models predicting the localization\nof added d-electrons and the importance of impurities\nraise questions about this approach [5, 6]. Moreover, the\nsimilarity of the phase diagram produced by nominally\nisovalent Ru substitution [7, 8] to that of its aliovalent\ncounterparts necessitates a better understanding of the\ntrue nature of TM substitution.\nIn this study we compare the elastic transport scattering rate and superconducting transition temperature\n\nTc for a wide range of optimally doped TM-substituted\n122 compounds and observe a universal correlation that\nfollows an Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG)-like pair-breaking\nsuppression for all types of transition metal substituents\nand alkaline earth cations. We show that the large variations in optimal Tc values found in different 122 systems are due to variations in impurity scattering rate,\nbut are also limited by an ideal zero-scattering limit that\nlies much below the Tc values of alkali metal-doped 122\nsystems. We discuss implications for order parameter\nstructure as well as constraints on the inter- and intraband coupling strength determined by the universal relation.\nSingle crystals of AFe2\u2212x TMx As2 compounds (with\nA=Ba, Sr; TM=Co, Ni, Pd, Pt) were synthesized using the FeAs self-flux method described previously [9].\nTM concentrations were determined by wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS). Resistivity and Hall\neffect data were measured in a commercial cryostat with\nHall coefficient (RH ) values obtained by antisymmetrizing field sweeps at constant temperature between -5 T\nand +5 T. To minimize geometric factor errors in determining scattering rates, six-wire measurements were\nused to simultaneously determine longidudinal (\u03c1xx ) and\ntransverse (\u03c1xy ) resistivities, using gold wire and silver\npaint contacts with typical contact resistances of \u223c 1 \u03a9.\nTransition temperatures for samples measured by our\ngroup were determined by the mid-point of the resistive\ntransitions, and are well documented in previous publications to coincide with magnetization measurements\n[9, 12]. Data obtained from the literature utilized the\nsame criteria when possible, and used stated values otherwise.\nUnlike the BaFe2 As2 family, the maximum or \"optimal\" transition temperature Tc(max) for different TMdoped versions of the SrFe2 As2 system exhibits a wide\nvariation of values, reaching \u223c20 K for Co, Rh and Ir\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Phase diagrams of the SrFe2\u2212x Nix As2 [9] and\nSrFe2\u2212x Ptx As2 [12] systems. Antiferromagnetic (triangles)\nand superconducting (diamonds) transition temperatures are\nplotted for Ni- (open symbols) and Pt-doped (closed symbols) systems. The similar rate of suppression of the magnetic\nphases and the position of the superconducting domes, with\noptimal doping at x \u2243 0.16 for both cases, is to be contrasted\nwith the considerably different Tc(max) values of 9 K and 16 K\nfor Ni- and Pt-doped series, respectively.\n\n[10, 11], 16 K for Pt [12], 9 K for Ni [9] and 8 K for Pd\nsubstitution [10]. As a prime example, we directly compare the phase diagrams of the SrFe2\u2212x Nix As2 [9] and\nSrFe2\u2212x Ptx As2 [12] systems in Fig. 1. As shown, the\nantiferromagnetic order transition TN follows an almost\nidentical decline as a function of either Pt or Ni substitution, with minimal difference between the two systems.\nThe similar positioning of the superconducting dome for\neach system at an optimal concentration of x \u2243 0.16 follows that expected for the nominally equivalent addition\nof two d-electrons from both Pt and Ni substituents, as\ncompared to that of SrFe2\u2212x Cox As2 with only one delectron contribution and a significantly larger optimal\ndoping of x \u2243 0.24 [13]. However, a significant factor\nof two difference is apparent in Tc(max) values, presenting an intriguing contrast in two systems with nominally\nidentical phase diagrams.\nWith similar modification of unit cell parameters [12],\nidentical oxidation states and nearly identical phase diagrams in both substitution series, we consider intrinsic\nvariations in pair-breaking scattering rates as the primary origin of this contrast. Following previous studies,\nwhich have shown that electron bands dominate transport in the TM-doped systems [14\u201316] and optical conductivity studies which indicate a single dominant Drudelike component [17, 18], we utilize a simple one-band\n\nFIG. 2: Six-wire measurements of resistivity (main panel) and\nHall coefficient (inset) of optimally-doped SrFe2\u2212x Pdx As2 ,\nSrFe2\u2212x Nix As2 , SrFe2\u2212x Cox As2 and BaFe2\u2212x Ptx As2 , with\nTc values of 7, 8, 17 and 20 K, respectively. The schematic\ndepicts the configuration of the six-wire measurement.\n\nmodel [19, 20] to estimate the elastic (T = 0) transport\nscattering rate, allowing for broad comparisons between\ndifferent systems and data sets. The normal state scatxx\ntering rate, \u0393 = me\u03c1\u2217 R\n, where e is the electronic charge\nH\n\u2217\nand m is the effective mass, is determined from transport measurements by extrapolating the resistivity \u03c1xx\nand Hall coefficient RH to zero temperature using power\nlaw fits over an extended range of temperatures above\nTc . We use an effective mass of m\u2217 = 2me based on the\nmeasured values for the electron bands in CaFe2 As2 [23],\nSrFe2 As2 [21] and BaFe2 As2 [22] from quantum oscillation measurements and an optical conductivity measurement on optimally Co-doped BaFe2 As2 [24].\nSix-wire measurements were used to determine both\n\u03c1xx and RH simultaneously for several optimally-doped\nsamples with a range of Tc values, thereby significantly\nreducing geometric factor error in calculating \u0393 by eliminating sample thickness dependence. Shown in Fig. 2,\nfour different optimally-doped TM-substituted samples\n(Ni-, Pd-, Co- and Pt-based with Tc values of 7 K, 8 K,\n17 K, and 20 K, respectively) exhibit an observable difference in absolute resistivity values dominated by a rigid\nshift in the zero-temperature elastic contribution \u03c10 , as\nevident from the comparable inelastic contributions (i.e.,\nslope of \u03c1(T )). The resulting contrast in Tc values follows this trend, with a systematic reduction of Tc with\nincreasing \u03c10 .\nWe compare the resultant Tc (\u0393) values with those calculated for all optimally doped TM-substituted 122 samples with \u03c1xx and RH values available in the literature,\n\n\f3\nas shown in Fig. 3. (All data corresponds to systems\nwith electron-dominated transport with the exception of\nRu substitution, for which we utilize the electron component of \u03c1xx extracted with a two-band analysis and\nne from ARPES measurements[37] to obtain a value of \u0393\nthat can be compared with the other data.) Remarkably,\nall Tc values follow the same trend of suppression with increasing \u0393, as expected in the AG formalism for a superconductor with increasing levels of pair-breaking impurities [20, 25\u201327], but surprising in light of the variety of\nsystems presented. In particular, there is no clear trend\nassociated with species of alkaline earth cation or transition metal substituent except for an average reduced\nscattering rate for Ba-based systems. This is likely correlated with both the lower substitution concentrations\nrequired to reach optimal doping as well as the lower\nTN ordering temperatures in BaFe2 As2 as compared to\nboth SrFe2 As2 and CaFe2 As2 . Note that \u0393 values for\nBaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 and BaFe2\u2212x Nix As2 are nearly identical\nto those obtained in optical conductivity measurements\n[18] if we assume the same effective mass values, providing a confirmation of our analysis.\nThe rate of suppression of Tc , defined by the critical\nscattering rate \u0393c where Tc is completely suppressed,\nis in general dependent on the type of scatterers and\nthe order parameter symmetry: according to Anderson's theorem, fully-gapped s-wave superconductors only\nrespond to magnetic impurities, while unconventional\npairing symmetries can be affected by both magnetic\nand nonmagnetic impurities [28]. Assuming predominant non-magnetic scattering as evidenced by a paramagnetic normal state and no obvious indication of enhanced magnetism due to TM substitution (e.g., absence\nof any enhanced susceptibility) [9, 12], the presence of\nnon-magnetic pair-breaking points to a sign-changing order parameter. However, several substitution [27, 29] and\nirradiation [20, 30, 31] studies report a much weaker rate\nof suppression than that expected for a sign-changing order parameter; calculations for an ideal s\u00b1 superconductor with full gaps on both bands [26] and strong interband\nscattering yield \u0393c (s\u00b1 ) = 1.8\u00d71013 s\u22121 [20, 30, 32], with\nsimilar values for the d-wave case [26]. Shown in Fig. 3,\na fit to the typical AG functional form [25] yields a value\n\u0393c = 1.5 \u00d7 1014 s\u22121 corresponding to a critical mean free\npath of \u223c 1.1 nm (using Fermi velocity vf = 1.7\u00d7105 m/s\n[21]), close to the expected superconducting coherence\nlength \u03be = 2.8 nm [33].\nHowever, this value is also an order of magnitude\nweaker than the expected \u0393c (s\u00b1 ), presenting a significant challenge to models considering a fully gapped s\u00b1\npairing symmetry, particularly in the presence of strong\ninterband scattering [3]. But calculations using the Tmatrix approximation for an s\u00b1 state emphasize that\nboth inter- and intra-band scattering in the unitary limit\ncan be decreased with appropriate parameters, resulting\nin a possible four-fold increase of \u0393c [34] that may offer an\n\nFIG. 3: Effect of transition metal substitution on Tc values of a wide variety of 122 superconductors at optimal doping concentrations, plotted as a function of the experimental\ntransport scattering rate \u0393 \u2261 e\u03c1/RH m\u2217 (see text).

Samples of SrFe2\u2212x Cox As2 and SrFe2\u2212x Nix As2 denoted\nwith an \"a\" are annealed (see text and footnote [43]). All\nTc values follow a universal rate of suppression with \u0393 well\ndescribed by an Abrikosov-Gor'kov fit (dashed line) that is\nmuch weaker than expected for a superconductor with s\u00b1\nsymmetry and interband scattering (dotted line) [20, 30, 32].\n\nexplanation, and may in fact be used to extract the relative strength of inter- and intraband scattering in these\nsystems. In addition, recent studies that consider the effects of disorder on both superconductivity and competing states [35] provide an alternative explanation for the\napparent weak pair-breaking effects observed throughout\nthe iron-based superconductor family.\nThe optimum clean-limit (\u0393=0) transition temperature Tc0 is an important parameter since it is the value\nthat should be utilized in considering the intrinsic pairing strength. Our determination of Tc0 = 26 K is consistent with the well-established maximum Tc value of\n\u223c 25 K found among all TM-doped 122 systems [1],\nas well as with extrapolated estimations of pressureand doping-optimized systems such as shown in the\ncomparison of BaFe2\u2212x Rux As2 substitution and pressure dependence [36]. But this observation raises an\nintriguing question about why Tc0 does not approach\nthat found in higher Tc intermetallic systems including\nSr1\u2212x Kx Fe2 As2 , Ba1\u2212x Kx Fe2 As2 and BaFe2 As2\u2212x Px [1],\n\n\f4\nwhich have calculated \u0393 values in the range shown in\nFig. 3. In contrast to the typical explanation of a reduced\nlevel of active-plane disorder as the reason for higher\nTc values in the alkali metal-doped systems, the determination of Tc0 and its failure to reach \u223c 40 K suggests\na fundamental asymmetry in pairing strength between\nelectron- and hole-doped systems that does not arise from\nscattering differences alone (although the effects of strong\nscattering in the hole bands [14, 15, 19, 37] cannot be discounted as a factor in the observed asymmetry).\nA universal Tc (\u0393) relation suggests a similar pairing\npotential for all TM-doped 122 compounds that is disrupted by a common scattering mechanism. It is not\nclear why certain TM substitutions induce more scattering than others, but dramatic variations in seemingly similar elemental substitutions are not unprecedented. For instance, the BaFe2\u2212x Rux As2 system requires \u223c 30-40% Ru substitution to obtain optimal doping, which is almost four times higher concentration than\nCo substitution but results in a very similar value of\nTc(max) . Such a contrast has been argued to arise from\nthe aliovalent versus isovalent nature of, respectively,\nCo and Ru substituents, but recent work has put this\ninto question. Mossbauer studies of BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 and\nBaFe2\u2212x Nix As2 find no change in d-electron population\nwith substitution [38], while an x-ray absorption study\nreveals no change in the Fe valence with Co substitution\nin BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 [39]. Furthermore, recent calculations\nsuggest that substituted d-electrons can remain localized\nat the substituent sites [5], either still resulting in a rigid\nband shift [6] or generating a phase diagram strikingly\nsimilar to that expected from a rigid band shift [40].\nVariations in impurity or disorder levels due to details\nof substitution chemistry likely play a key role in explaining the variation in \u0393 values observed in the 122\nseries of superconductors. This is corroborated by observations of enhancements in Tc values after annealing\ncrystals of both low- and high-\u0393 systems, in particular BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 [41] and SrFe2\u2212x Nix As2 [42], respectively, and confirmed by our study of a SrFe2\u2212x Nix As2\ncrystal with six-wire measurements obtained before and\nafter annealing: as shown in Fig. 3, the shift of data\nalong the AG curve indicates an inverse relation between\nTc and \u0393 [43]. In the case of BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 [41], annealing was shown to enhance Tc to a maximum value\nof 25 K, consistent with our determined Tc0 value. The\nreason why the BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 system is closest to the\nclean limit is not known, however a lack of observable\ndisorder in Fe-As bond lengths in BaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 may\nhave provided an important insight [44]; it would be interesting to perform the same study on high-\u0393 systems\nto confirm this scenario.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of\na universal pair-breaking relation for a wide range of optimally transition metal-doped 122 systems, suggesting\na common scattering mechanism and pairing potential\n\nacross the series. The rate of suppression of Tc and the\ncontrast between the optimum (zero-scattering) Tc0 value\nof \u223c26 K and the higher Tc values achieved in nontransition metal substitution series provides important\nconstraints on the pairing symmetry and mechanism in\nthe intermetallic iron-based superconductors.\nThe authors acknowledge A.
