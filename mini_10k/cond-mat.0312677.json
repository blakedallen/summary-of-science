The proposed mechanism requires that the coherent diffusion constant is much\nlarger than estimated from the alpha relaxation time. This is justified by reference to the solidity\nof viscous liquids in an argument which, by utilizing the irrelevance of momentum conservation at\nhigh viscosity and introducing a center of mass diffusion constant, implies that at high viscosity the\ncoherent diffusion constant is much larger than the incoherent diffusion constant.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nViscous liquids and the glass transition have attracted\nconsiderable interest for many years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nThe solidity of viscous liquids refers to their solidness,\ni.e., that a viscous liquid is similar to a disordered solids\nbecause molecular motion is mostly vibrational. This\nwas the view, e.g., of Goldstein who in his now classic\n1969 paper expressed the belief that \"when all is said\nand done, the existence of potential energy barriers large\ncompared to thermal energy are intrinsic to the occurrence of the glassy state, and dominate flow, at least\nat low temperatures\" [7]. This implies that solid-state\nelasticity arguments are relevant and useful for understanding viscous liquid dynamics [7]. Actually, the view\nthat viscous liquids are like solids by mostly being in\nelastic equilibrium is obvious already from Kauzmann's\n1948 review, which referred to these large barrier transitions (flow events) as \"jumps of molecular units of flow\nbetween different positions of equilibrium in the liquid's\nquasicrystalline lattice\" [1]. In the same spirit, Mooney\nin 1957 wrote that \"a liquid not only could be but perhaps should be treated as an elastic continuum with a\nstress relaxation mechanism\" [8].\nBased on the solidity property a theory for the nonArrhenius temperature dependence of the viscosity was\nproposed some time ago, according to which the activation energy is proportional to the instantaneous shear\nmodulus (the shoving model) [9]. This was justified by\narguing that during a barrier transition the surrounding\nliquid behaves like a solid subject to elastic deformation,\nand that most of the barrier energy is shear elastic energy\nlocated in the surroundings. In two subsequent papers (I\nand II, [10]) we further discussed the solidity of viscous\nliquids and introduced a \"solidity length,\" l, giving the\nlength scale below which a viscous liquid is virtually indistinguishable from a disordered solid \u2013 albeit one that\nflows.\nBy proceeding inductively from experiment the present\npaper argues that solidity may explain generic features of\nthe primary relaxation process in viscous liquids, the socalled alpha process. Alpha relaxation is the slowest and\nthe dominant relaxation process. The alpha process is re-\n\nsponsible for the glass transition, the kinetic falling out of\nequilibrium taking place when the cooling rate d ln T /dt\nexceeds the alpha relaxation rate [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Alpha\nrelaxation is observable in dielectric relaxation experiments and in measurements of the frequency-dependent\nshear and bulk moduli [2, 11] and, e.g., of the frequencydependent specific heat [12, 13]. The loss peaks obtained\nby measuring these linear response properties are of similar shape, but usually not identical. The loss peak frequencies are also similar, but not identical, and their temperature dependencies are usually quite similar. In the\nfollowing we shall not dwell on the dissimilarities. The\nfocus is on the shear modulus, adopting the point of view\nthat this is the primary response function while, e.g., the\ndielectric loss is determined by the coupling of molecular\nrotation to shear flow [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nThe characteristic features of alpha response functions\n\u03c7(\u03c9), as reported in the literature, are: 1) The loss peak\nfrequency \u03c9m is non-Arrhenius with an activation energy\nwhich increases as temperature decreases; 2) on the lowfrequency side of the loss peak the loss is virtually Debye\nlike (\u221d \u03c9); 3) on the high-frequency side there are significant deviations from Debye behavior, here the loss decays following an approximate power law: \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u2212n\n(n < 1). In many cases a wing is observed a few decades\nabove the loss peak frequency where n changes to a lower\nvalue.\nThe vast majority of experiments report values of n between 0.3 and 0.7 [19]. The exponent n is often temperature dependent, implying a violation of time-temperature\nsuperposition. At the 1997 3rd International Discussion\nMeeting on Relaxations in Complex Systems it was suggested by Olsen that beta processes may play a role at\nmuch lower frequencies than generally expected, and that\nthese could explain the wing [20]. This was subsequently\nconfirmed by Lunkenheimer and co-workers who, upon\nlong-time annealing of propylene carbonate and glycerol,\nfound that the wing indeed develops into a separate relaxation process [21]. While the matter is still actively\ndiscussed, in the opinion of the Roskilde group the following picture emerges [22]: Once the effects of beta processes are minimized by going to sufficiently low temperatures (still in the equilibrium liquid phase), the generic\n\n\f2\nfeatures of alpha relaxation come to light. Generic alpha\nrelaxation obeys time-temperature superposition, and for\nthe high-frequency asymptotic behavior the generic alpha process is characterized by the universal exponent\nn = 1/2:\n\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032gen (\u03c9)\n\n\u221d\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03c9\n, \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9m\n.\n\u03c9 \u22121/2 , \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9m\n\n(1)\n\nFinally, generic alpha relaxation does not have universal loss peak widths. This conclusion was reached from\ndielectric relaxation measurements on several molecular\nliquids [22], but it applies also for the shear modulus\nG(\u03c9) [23, 24], although shear mechanical measurements\nare considerably less accurate than dielectric measurements.\n\nconditions [40]. Cichocki and Felderhof [41] in 1994 derived the \u03c9 \u22121/2 high-frequency tail in a three-dimensional\ndiffusion model with a radial potential barrier, which is\nmathematically similar to the Isakovich-Chaban model.\n\u2013 Most of these models involve some species obeying the\ndiffusion equation, which is assumed to apply also at\ntimes shorter than the alpha relaxation time [42]. This\nnontrivial assumption is also central for the \"long-time\ntail\" mechanism discussed below.\nThe BEL model focuses on the shear compliance\nJ(\u03c9) = 1/G(\u03c9). In dimensionless units the BEL model\nhas a definite prediction for J(\u03c9), implying universal loss\npeak width. Because this prediction did not fit all experiments, the BEL expression was soon formally generalized\nby the same authors [43] to\nJ(\u03c9) = a + b (i\u03c9)\u22121/2 + c (i\u03c9)\u22121 .\n\nII.\n\nTHE BEL MODEL AND ITS FORMAL\nGENERALIZATION\n\nCuriously enough, the conjecture that n = 1/2 is a\n\"fixed point,\" which equilibrium viscous liquids approach\nat sufficiently low temperatures, represents a step backwards in time. Around 1970 it was noted that n is often\nclose to 1/2, and there was a considerable interest in\nexplaining this theoretically. Some models, which over\ntime have been suggested to explain Eq. (1) or its equivalents, are: In 1948 Zener in his theory of \"relaxation\nby thermal diffusion\" for ultrasonic loss predicted that\nthe internal friction at high frequencies varies as \u03c9 \u22121/2\n[25]. Glarum (in 1960), Doremus (1970), Phillips, Barlow, and Lamb (1972), Bordewijk (1975), Kimmich and\nVoigt (1978), Wyllie (1979), and Condat (1989) all arrived at the \u03c9 \u22121/2 -tail from essentially one-dimensional\ndiffusion models [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. This is also\nbasically the mathematical mechanism in the model of\nIsakovich and Chaban, who in 1966 predicted a limiting high-frequency sound absorption per wavelength in\nhighly viscous liquids varying as \u03c9 \u22121/2 by regarding the\nliquid as a micro-inhomogeneous medium [33] (see also\nRef. [34]). In 1967 Barlow, Erginsav, and Lamb, in\nwhat is referred to as the BEL model, took an electrical engineer's approach and regarded the shear mechanical impedance of a viscous liquid as a parallel combination of a Newtonian liquid and a Hookean solid, implying an \u03c9 \u22121/2 -tail for the high frequency shear modulus\n[2, 35, 36]. Montrose and Litovitz in 1970 derived the\n\u03c9 \u22121/2 -tail in a model invoking diffusion and relaxation\nof some unspecified order [37]. Majumdar, working in\nthe time domain, arrived at the short time equivalent of\nthe high-frequency tail in 1971 from the assumption that\ndiffusive modes exist with amplitude \u221d k \u22122 [38]. Cunat\nin 1988 from a purely thermodynamic treatment arrived\nat a distribution of relaxation\ntimes on the logarithmic\n\u221a\nscale \u03c4 proportional to \u03c4 for \u03c4 \u2192 0, which implies the\n\u03c9 \u22121/2 high-frequency tail [39]. Sj\u00f6gren in 1990 showed\nthat Eq. (1) arises in mode-coupling theory under certain\n\n(2)\n\nThe original BEL model corresponds to b2 = 4ac.\nClearly, Eq. (2) implies Eq. (1) for the shear modulus loss\nG\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9). In dimensionless units Eq. (2), which we shall refer to as the \"generalized BEL expression,\" has one free\nparameter and thus nonuniversal loss peak width.\nIII. THE GENERALIZED BEL EXPRESSION AS\nA CONSEQUENCE OF A LONG-TIME TAIL\n\nEquation (2) gives a good representation of generic\nalpha relaxation. We proceed to use the fluctuationdissipation (FD) theorem to translate Eq. (2) into a\nstatement concerning a velocity autocorrelation function.\nAccording to the FD theorem, if Q is the x-direction displacement of the top of the liquid (area L2 in the x-yplane, height h in the z-direction), the shear compliance\nis given by\n\nJ(\u03c9) =\n\ni\u03c9 L2\n2 kB T h\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nh\u2206Q2 (t)i e\u2212i\u03c9t dt .\n\n(3)\n\nHere h\u2206Q2 (t)i is the equilibrium mean-square displacement of Q in time t, i.e., the zero shear stress thermal\naverage of the square of \u2206Q(t) \u2261 Q(t) \u2212 Q(0).\nVia Eq. (3) the generalized BEL expression Eq. (2)\ntranslates into\nh\u2206Q2 (t)i = A + B t1/2 + C t .\n\n(4)\n\nIn terms of the Q mean-square displacement the velocity\nautocorrelation function is given by\n\nhQ\u0307(0)Q\u0307(t)i =\n\n1 d2\nh\u2206Q2 (t)i .\n2 dt2\n\n(5)\n\nThe generalized BEL expression is thus mathematically\nequivalent to\n\n\f3\n\nhQ\u0307(0)Q\u0307(t)i \u221d \u2212 t\u22123/2 .\n\n(6)\n\nEquation (6), which is a simple way to summarize basic\ncharacteristics of generic alpha relaxation, immediately\nbrings to mind the long-time tails discovered in 1967 by\nAlder and Wainwright in early molecular dynamics simulations of liquids [44]. These authors showed that the velocity autocorrelation function for a single molecule does\nnot decay exponentially to zero at long times as previously expected, but as a power law with exponent \u22123/2:\nh\u1e8b(0)\u1e8b(t)i \u221d + t\u22123/2 (t \u2192 \u221e) .\n\nWhat is the required conserved variable? Angular momentum conservation is irrelevant for the same reason\nthat momentum conservation is. Energy conservation\ncould be relevant because heat conduction is rather slow,\nbut this process is almost temperature independent and\nthus seemingly unable to give alpha relaxation times,\nwhich depend dramatically on temperature. The only\nalternative left is particle number conservation.\nLong-time tails arise from particle number conservation because density fluctuations at long times decay following the diffusion equation, leading to (where \u2206\u03c1 is the\ndeviation from average density)\n\n(7)\n\nThe explanation is the following. According to statistical mechanics at any given time molecular velocities\nare uncorrelated. Consider a particular molecule at time\nt = 0. It has a certain momentum while the surrounding molecules on average have zero momentum. As time\npasses the momentum of the molecule in question diffuses\nto the surrounding molecules (because the Navier-Stokes\nequation is basically a transverse momentum diffusion\nequation). At time t the momentum has diffused the distance \u223c t1/2 away, thus spread among \u223c t3/2 molecules.\nIf the initial momentum of the molecule in question is\nroughly equally shared among these, on average every\nmolecule has momentum \u223c t\u22123/2 . This includes the particular molecule in focus, thus explaining Eq. (7). \u2013 A\nnice classical review of long-time tails is that of Pomeau\nand Resibois from 1975 [45], while Kirkpatrick and coworkers recently gave an excellent review from a more\ngeneral point of view [46].\nCentral to the above argument are momentum conservation and the diffusion equation. If Eq. (6) were to\nreflect a long-time tail, two questions come to mind: 1)\nWhat is the role of momentum conservation in viscous\nliquids? 2) How does one explain a negative long-time\ntail [47]?\nThe first question arises because viscous liquids close to\nthe calorimetric glass transition have viscosities roughly\n1014 times larger than that of liquids like ambient water.\nSince the kinematic viscosity is the transverse momentum\ndiffusion constant, these liquids have extremely large momentum diffusion constants. Consider a flow event taking\nthe system from one minimum to another. If momentum\nconservation were relevant, a flow event could not result\nin movement of the center of mass. In reality the liquid\nis confined by container walls; these provide the external\nforces possibly needed to move the center of mass slightly\nto ensure that the molecules at the walls do not move.\nThus just as momentum conservation plays no role for\nthe description of point defect motion in crystals, momentum conservation is irrelevant for the description of\nviscous liquid dynamics under laboratory conditions [48].\nTurning to the second question, it is shown in the next\nsection that velocity autocorrelation functions are negative in any stochastic dynamics, i.e., dynamics described\nby a master equation.\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u2206\u03c1(r, 0)\u2206\u03c1(r , t)i \u221d t\n\n\u22123/2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(r \u2212 r\u2032 )2\nexp \u2212\n.\n4Dt\n\n(8)\n\nFrom Eq. (8) it follows that any generic variable F with\nzero average which is a [non-linear] function of density,\ndecays following\nhF (0)F (t)i \u221d + t\u22123/2 (t \u2192 \u221e) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe Appendix gives a simple example of how Eq. (8)\nimplies Eq. (9).\nIV.\n\nNEGATIVE LONG-TIME TAILS IN\nSTOCHASTIC DYNAMICS\n\nViscous liquids are believed to be well described by\nstochastic dynamics [49, 50]. This could take the form\nof Langevin dynamics or, in the ultimate course-grained\nversion, hopping between energy (\"inherent dynamics\"\n[50]). We proceed to show that the velocity autocorrelation function in any stochastic dynamics can be written\nas the negative of a state autocorrelation function. If\nPi is P\nthe probability for state i, the master equation is\n\u1e56i = j \u039bij Pj . If the Green's function \u2013 the probability\nto go from state i to k in time t \u2013 is denoted by Gi\u2192k (t),\nand Peq,i is the equilibrium probability of state i, Eq. (5)\nimplies\n\nhQ\u0307(0)Q\u0307(t)i =\n\n1X\nd2\n(Qi \u2212 Qj )2 Peq,i 2 Gi\u2192j (t) . (10)\n2 i,j\ndt\n\nUsing the fact that the Green's\nfunction solves the masP\n\u039b\nG\nter equation (\u0120i\u2192j =\nk jk i\u2192k ), detailed balance\n(Peq,i Gi\u2192j\n(t)\n=\nP\nG\neq,j j\u2192i (t)), and probability conserP\nvation ( i \u039bij = 0), the right hand side of Eq. (10) is\nreduced as follows:\n1X\n(Qi \u2212 Qj )2 Peq,i \u039bjk \u0120i\u2192k (t)\n2\ni,j,k\n\n=\n\n1X\n(Qi \u2212 Qj )2 \u039bjk Peq,k \u0120k\u2192i (t)\n2\ni,j,k\n\n\f4\n1 X 2\n(Qi + Q2j \u2212 2Qi Qj )\u039bjk Peq,k \u039bil Gk\u2192l (t)\n2\ni,j,k,l\nX\n= \u2212\n(Qi \u039bil )(Qj \u039bjk )Peq,k Gk\u2192l (t) .\n(11)\n=\n\ni,j,k,l\n\nThus in terms of the variable Bk \u2261\n[51]\n\nP\n\nj\n\nQj \u039bjk we have\n\nhQ\u0307(0)Q\u0307(t)i = \u2212 hB(0)B(t)i .\n\n(12)\n\nSince autocorrelation functions of any state function are\nalways positive in stochastic dynamics, this proves that\nthe velocity autocorrelation function is always negative.\nMoreover, as argued above, generic autocorrelation functions decay as t\u22123/2 for t \u2192 \u221e. We thus get the required\nEq. (6).\nV. CONDITION FOR LONG-TIME TAILS TO\nOPERATE AT RELATIVELY SHORT TIMES\n\nThe negative t\u22123/2 -decay applies as t \u2192 \u221e. The obvious question is how a long-time tail could play any role at\ntimes shorter than the alpha relaxation time. The only\npossibility, it seems, is that density fluctuations, even at\nthese relatively short times, decay follow the diffusion\nequation. Thus even for a few decades of time shorter\nthan \u03c4\u03b1 the coherent intermediate scattering function\nS(k, t) should obey\n\nWhen asked what to expect if the coherent and incoherent diffusion constants decouple, a majority of researchers opted for the opposite inequality. Equation\n(15) cannot be ruled out on experimental grounds, however, because there seems to be no measurements of\nthe coherent diffusion constant for liquids just above the\ncalorimetric glass transition.\nVI.\n\nDIFFUSION CONSTANT DECOUPLING AS\nA CONSEQUENCE OF SOLIDITY\n\nIn this section we prove that the required diffusion constant decoupling is consistent with the solidity of viscous\nliquids. More accurately, it is shown that if the coherent diffusion constant is frequency independent, solidity\nimplies diffusion constant decoupling. We consider N\nmolecules in volume V , however not with periodic boundary conditions. Density fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the quantity \u03c1k defined [53] by the\nfollowing sum over all molecular positions rj :\n1 X ik*rj\n\u03c1k = \u221a\n.\ne\nN j\n\n(16)\n\nIf a is the average intermolecular distance, the coherent\ndiffusion constant defines a characteristic time tc via tc =\na2 /D. It is natural to expect that Eq. (13) applies only\nat times much longer than tc . Thus the condition for the\nlong-time tail mechanism to work above the alpha loss\npeak frequency is that tc \u226a \u03c4\u03b1 , or\n\nThe static structure factor is given by S(k) = h\u03c1k \u03c1\u2212k i\nand the coherent intermediate scattering function by\nS(k, t) = h\u03c1k (t)\u03c1\u2212k (0)i [53]. In liquids and solids the\nlong-wavelength limit of S(k) is a very small number\nequal to the ratio between system compressibility and\nideal gas compressibility at same density and temperature. Alternatively, the long-wavelength limit may be expressed in terms of the number M of molecules in a large\nsubvolume and its fluctuations: S(k \u2192 0) = h\u2206M 2 i/hM i\n[53, 54] (which is one for an ideal gas by Poisson statistics, but much smaller for liquids and solids). This number has two contributions, one from the phonon degrees\nof freedom and one from the inherent dynamics. The inherent part of this small number [55] is thus even smaller.\nHenceforth S(k) refers to only the inherent part of the\nstructure factor, so we clearly have\n\na2\n\u226a D.\n\u03c4\u03b1\n\nS(k \u2192 0) \u226a 1 .\n\nS(k, t)\n= exp(\u2212Dk 2 t) .\nS(k)\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThe single-particle [incoherent] diffusion constant Ds\nis defined by Ds = h\u2206x2 (t)i/2t (t \u2192 \u221e). One naively\nexpects that information about the structure is basically\nforgotten when \u2013 and only when \u2013 the molecules on average have moved an intermolecular distance. This would\nimply that Ds \u223c a2 /\u03c4\u03b1 , which may well be the case for\nsome liquids. In several liquids, however, it has been observed that Ds is much larger than a2 /\u03c4\u03b1 [52]. In either\ncase, Eq. (14) is clearly obeyed if the coherent and the\nincoherent diffusion constants decouple as follows:\nDs \u226a D .\n\n(15)\n\n(17)\n\nWe shall assume that inherent density fluctuations are\ndescribed by a linear Langevin equation,\n\u03c1\u0307k = \u2212\u03b3(k)\u03c1k + \u03bek (t) .\n\n(18)\n\nThe last term is the usual Gaussian white noise\ncharacterized by \u03bek\u2217 = \u03be\u2212k and h\u03bek (t)\u03bek\u2032 (t\u2032 )i =\n2\u03b3(k)S(k)\u03b4k+k\u2032 ,0 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), which ensures that S(k) =\nh\u03c1k \u03c1\u2212k i. We proceed to argue that in the k \u2192 0 limit\nsolidity implies that \u03b3(k) \u221d k 2 (as expected from particle conservation) and Ds \u226a D, where D is defined by\n\u03b3(k) = Dk 2 . In particular, Eq. (18) implies Eq. (13) for\nthe intermediate scattering function.\n\n\f5\nIt is assumed that V 1/3 is smaller than the solidity\nlength. This implies that in the time between two flow\nevents there is elastic equilibrium throughout the sample\n[10]. We may thus adopt inherent dynamics [50], which\nregard flow events as instantaneous rearrangements taking the system from one energy minimum (inherent state\n[56]) to another.\nTo prove that solidity implies \u03b3(k) \u221d k 2 as k \u2192 0 we\nfirst consider a single flow event. If \u2206rj is the displacement of the j'th molecule, at small k the change in \u03c1k is\ngiven by\n1 X ik*rj\nik*\u2206rj (k \u2192 0) .\ne\n\u03b4\u03c1k = \u221a\nN j\n\n(20)\n\nh\u2206X 2 (t)i\n(t \u2192 \u221e) .\n2N t\n\nh\u2206X 2 (t)i\n(t \u2192 0) .\nDCM (\u221e) =\n2N t\n\n(22)\n\nOver a short time span flow events are uncorrelated.Thus,\nif the number of transitions per molecule per unit time is\ndenoted by \u0393 and h\u2206X 2 i is the average squared change\nof X in one flow event, the change in \u03c1k in a short time\nt is given by\n1\nh|\u2206\u03c1k (t)| i = N \u0393t k 2 h\u2206X 2 i = \u0393tk 2 h\u2206X 2 i (k \u2192 0) .\nN\n(23)\nOn the other hand, the change in \u03c1k over a short time\nis determined by the noise term of Eq. (18), leading to\n2\n\nDCM (\u221e)\n.\nD\n\n(25)\n\nFrom the inequality (17) we conclude that\nDCM (\u221e) \u226a D .\n\n(26)\n\nConsider a flow event taking the system from one minimum to another. In the time between two flow events\nthere is elastic equilibrium. The liquid is indistinguishable from a disordered solids, and a flow event induces slight adjustments of the positions of molecules\nfar from the relatively few molecules that move considerably [10, 50]. If the liquid were completely homogeneous\nand isotropic before and after the flow event, the total\ndisplacement \u2206R would be zero. This is not realistic,\nhowever, so there is no reason to expect the total displacements to be zero. According to standard elasticity\ntheory [10, 31, 57, 58] displacements far from the center\nof the flow event are small, varying with distance as r\u22122 .\nTheir contribution to \u2206R is insignificant, so we expect\n\n(21)\n\nHere it is understood that the N, V \u2192 \u221e limit is taken\nbefore t \u2192 \u221e. If DCM is frequency dependent, the above\nexpression defines the dc limit. The high-frequency limit,\nDCM (\u221e), is determined by the mean-square displacement at short times:\n\n(24)\n\nFor the limit to be well defined and nonzero we must have\n\u03b3(k) \u221d k 2 .\nWriting \u03b3(k) = Dk 2 , we proceed to show that solidity implies Ds \u226a D. First note that, since DCM (\u221e) =\n\u0393h\u2206X 2 i/2, Eq. (24) becomes\nS(k \u2192 0) =\n\nIf momentum conservation were relevant, one would\nhave \u2206R=0, because the center of mass is fixed. A\ncharacteristic feature of viscous liquids, however, is the\nalready mentioned irrelevance of momentum conservation [48]. Besides the coherent and single-particle diffusion constants there is consequently a third diffusion\nconstant, which we shall refer to as the \"center of mass\ndiffusion constant,\" DCM . In order to be well-defined in\nthe N \u2192 \u221e limit, writing R = (X, Y, Z) the center of\nmass diffusion constant should be defined by\n\nDCM =\n\n\u0393k 2 h\u2206X 2 i\n.\n2\u03b3(k \u2192 0)\n\nS(k \u2192 0) =\n\n(19)\n\nIf r0 marks the location of largest molecular displacements, at small k the exponentials may all be replaced\nby exp(ik * r0 ). Thus, if R is the sum of all particle coordinates we get\neik*r0\n\u03b4\u03c1k = \u221a ik*\u2206R (k \u2192 0) .\nN\n\nh|\u2206\u03c1k (t)|2 i = 2\u03b3(k)S(k)t. Equating these two expressions leads to\n\nX\nj\n\n\u2206r2j \u223c\n\n\u0010X\n\n\u2206rj\n\nj\n\n\u00112\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nThis implies that the high-frequency limits of Ds and\nDCM are comparable:\nDs (\u221e) \u223c DCM (\u221e) .\n\n(28)\n\nFinally, we note that when diffusion constants are frequency dependent they always increase with frequency\n(see, e.g., Ref. [59]), and often quite a lot:\nDs \u226a Ds (\u221e) .\n\n(29)\n\nTo summarize, by representing the solidity of viscous\nliquids by inherent dynamics we have argued that\na2\n\u226a Ds \u226a Ds (\u221e) \u223c DCM (\u221e) \u226a D .\n\u03c4\u03b1\n\n(30)\n\n\f6\nThe strong inequality sign \u226a was used liberally throughout this section (the inequalities all hold with \u226a replaced\nby \u2264, though): The first strong inequality presumably\napplies only for some liquids [52], while for others there\nmay be near equality. The second strong inequality is\nlikely \u2013 because this is what is generally observed for hopping in disordered solids [59] \u2013 but not compelling. Only\nthe third strong inequality is compelling, being a direct\nconsequence of the small compressibility of liquids. Nevertheless, this is enough to establish the inequality (14),\nonce it is assumed that the coherent diffusion constant is\nfrequency independent.\n\nIf the deviation from average density is denoted by \u2206\u03c1 \u2261\n\u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1i, F is given as\nF = Const. +\n\nZ\n\ndrdr\u2032 \u03c6(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) \u2206\u03c1(r)\u2206\u03c1(r\u2032 ) .

It has been argued that the\nrequired decoupling of coherent from incoherent diffusion\nfollows from the solidity of viscous liquids. There are still\nproblems to be addressed. One is that the derivation of\nthe diffusion constant decoupling was based on the assumption that the sample is smaller than the solidity\nlength. If the alpha relaxation time is one second, the\nsolidity length is just a few thousand Angstroms [10].\nThe question arises how to deal with bulk viscous liquids. Given the fact that Eq. (18) does not allow bulk\nvolume relaxation on the alpha time scale, it is clear that\nsomething is missing [61]. Nevertheless, we surmise that\nthe long-time tail mechanism survives the necessary supplements to arrive at a full theory. Another problem\nis that the constants A and C of Eq. (4), which here\nappear as simple integration constants, cannot be arbitrary: In order for the generalized BEL expression to fit\ndata these constants must be related to the constant B\nby AC \u223c B 2 . A final challenge is to establish the consistency of the proposed scheme, where the coherent diffusion constant is assumed to be frequency independent\nwhereas the incoherent diffusion constant most likely is\nstrongly frequency dependent.\n\n(A.3)\n\nIn the Gaussian approximation the average of a product\nof four variables by Wick's theorem is a sum of three\nterms, each a product of two pair correlation functions.\nOne of the three terms is time-independent and we get\n[assuming \u03c6(r) = \u03c6(\u2212r)]\n\nhF (0)F (t)i = Const. + 2\n\nZ\n\ndr1 dr2 dr3 dr4 \u03c6(r1 \u2212 r2 )\u03c6(r3 \u2212 r4 )\n\n\u00d7 h\u2206\u03c1(r1 , 0)\u2206\u03c1(r3 , t)ih\u2206\u03c1(r2 , 0)\u2206\u03c1(r4 , t)i\nLetting t \u2192 \u221e we find hF i2 = const, so, if \u2206F \u2261 F \u2212hF i,\nEq.

Since the density correlation function goes to zero\nas |r \u2212 r\u2032 | \u2192 \u221e and t \u2192 \u221e, we have (where D is the\ndiffusion constant)\n\nAPPENDIX: LONG-TIME TAILS DERIVED\nFROM THE DIFFUSION EQUATION\n\nWe here show an example of how long-time tails typically arise. By \"long time\" is meant times long enough\nthat density fluctuations decay following the diffusion\nequation.

Risken, The Fokker-Planck Equation, 2nd Ed.\n(Springer, Berlin, 1989), p. 168. The variable B is given\nby B = \u039b+ Q where \u039b+ is the Hermetian conjugate\nof the operator \u039b, and Eq. (12) thus becomes particularly simple if the master equation is the Smoluchowski equation for a system described by a Langevin\nequation: If the Hamiltonian is denoted by H, the degrees of freedom by Xj , and the equation of motion\nis \u1e8aj = \u2212\u03bc\u2202j H+ noise, the Smoluchowski equation\nfor the probability density is \u1e56 = \u039bP where \u039b =\n(\u03bc/\u03b2)\u2202j exp(\u2212\u03b2H)\u2202j exp(\u03b2H) (sum over j, \u03b2 is the inverse temperature). The Hermetian conjugate of \u039b is\ngiven by \u039b+ = (\u03bc/\u03b2) exp(\u03b2H)\u2202j exp(\u2212\u03b2H)\u2202j . When this\noperator is applied to one of the coordinates, Xm , we\nget B \u2261 \u039b+ Xm = \u2212\u03bc\u2202m H. Thus, if the generalized\nforce Fj \u2261 \u2212\u2202j H is introduced, the Langevin equation is \u1e8aj = \u03bcFj + noise and Eq. (12) implies that\nthe generalized velocity autocorrelation function is given\nby (no sum over repeated indices) h\u1e8am (0)\u1e8am (t)i =\n\u2212\u03bc2 hFm (0)Fm (t)i. Note, incidentally, that this implies\nd2 /dt2 hXm (0)Xm (t)i = \u03bc2 hFm (0)Fm (t)i. Also, note that\na simple proof of the former identity comes from writing:\nnoise(t)=\u1e8am (t) + \u03bcFm (t); multiplying and averaging the\nnoise at two different times leads to four terms summing\nto zero, two of which themselves sum to zero by timereversal invariance.\n[52] F.

(18) is to add a kindependent decay channel: \u03c1\u0307k = \u2212(Dk2 +\u03b3\u03b1 )\u03c1k +\u03bek (t).\nThis would lead to a Debye frequency dependence of the\nisothermal bulk modulus, which actually cannot be ruled\nout, because only the adiabatic frequency-dependent\nbulk modulus has been measured in the relaxation region\n[T. Christensen and N. B. Olsen, Phys. Rev. B 49, 15396\n(1994)]. Below the solidity length Eq. (18) and our derivation of the diffusion constant decoupling should still apply (although the k \u2192 0 limit of Sec. VI would now be\nlimited to lengths below the solidity length).\n\n\f"}
