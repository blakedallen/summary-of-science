Different parity violating and parity conserving\nasymmetries and their dependence on neutron energy have been estimated for n +3 He \u21923 H + p\nreaction. The estimated effects are in a good agreement with available exact calculations.\n\n1\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of parity violating (PV) effects in low energy physics is important for the understanding of main features of the Standard model and for the possible search for manifestation\nof new physics. During the last decades, many calculations of different experimentally observed PV effects in nuclear physics have been done. However, in the last years, it became\nclear (see, for example [1\u20134] and references therein) that the traditional DDH [5] method\nfor the calculation of PV effects cannot reliably describe the available experimental data.\nThis could be blamed on the \"wrong\" experimental data, however it might be that the\nDDH approach is not adequate for the description of the set of precise experimental data\nbecause it is based on a number of models and assumptions. To resolve this discrepancy,\nit is desirable to increase the number of experimental data for different PV parameters in\na few-body systems. The calculations of nuclear related effects for these systems can be\ndone with high precision, eliminating as many as possible nuclear model dependent factors\ninvolved in PV effects. Unfortunately, currently available data of experimentally measured\nPV effects in these systems are not enough to constrain all parameters required for calculations, therefore, any new potentially possible measurement is very important. Since PV\neffects in a few-body systems are usually very small and precise calculations of them are\nrather difficult, it is desirable to have a method for a reliable estimate of possible observable\nparameters using available experimental data. This will give the opportunity to choose the\nright system and right PV observables for new experiments.\n\nRecently, it has been proposed to measure PV asymmetry of protons in n+3 He \u21923 H +p\nreaction with polarized neutrons at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory. The 3 He and 4 He systems were subjects of intensive investigation for a long\ntime, and as a result, many parameters related to reactions with neutrons and protons, as\nwell as to excitation energy levels of these nuclei, have been measured and evaluated by\na number of different groups. This rather comprehensive data provides the opportunity to\nestimate values of possible PV effects and their dependence on neutron energy in n+3 He \u21923\nH + p reaction using microscopic nuclear reaction theory approach.\n2\n\n\fDESCRIPTION OF PARITY VIOLATING EFFECTS\n\nLet us consider the n +3 He \u21923 H + p reaction with low energy neutrons. For neutron\n\nenergy En \u223c 0.01 eV , which corresponds to a wave vector kn \u223c 2.19 * 10\u22125 f m\u22121 , the energy\n\nof outgoing protons and proton wave vector are Ep = 0.764 MeV and kp = 0.19 f m\u22121 , correspondingly. Taking a characteristic 3 He radius as R = 1.97 f m, one obtains (kn R) \u223c 4 * 10\u22124\nand (kp R) \u223c 0.4. Therefore, for the initial channel, contributions from p-wave neutrons to\na reaction matrix (amplitude) are highly suppressed, whereas for the final channel, the amplitude with orbital momenta of protons l = 0 and l = 1 have the same order of magnitude.\nThe contribution from d-wave protons is suppressed by a factor \u223c 0.025, therefore, one can\nignore d-waves within the accuracy of our estimates. Assuming that neutrons, as well as\n3\n\nHe nuclei, may have a polarization, one shall consider four parity violating (PV) and four\nparity conserving (PC) angular correlations shown in Table I, where ~\u03c3 and I~ are neutron\nand nuclear spins. (It is important to know the values of PC correlations because they\nTABLE I. Possible parity violating and four parity conserving angular correlations.\nPV\n\nPC\n\n(~\u03c3 * ~kp )\n\n(~kn * ~kp )\n\n(~\u03c3 * ~kn ) (~\u03c3 * [~kn \u00d7 ~kp ])\n(I~ * ~kp )\n\n~\n(~\u03c3 * I)\n\n(I~ * ~kn ) (I~ * [~kn \u00d7 ~kp ])\n\nusually are one of the main sources of experimental errors for PV effects, and also because\nthey can be rather easily measured and, as a consequence, can serve as an indirect proof of\nthe correctness of calculations of PV effects.) We will focus on PV correlation (~\u03c3 * ~kp) which\nleads to PV asymmetry \u03b1P V of outgoing protons in a direction along to neutron polarization\nand opposite to it. It can be seen that the asymmetry related to the (I~ * ~kp ) correlation has\nexactly the same value for this reaction. For the completeness of the consideration, we will\ntot\nalso calculate the PV effect related to differences of total cross sections \u03c3\u00b1\nfor neutrons with\ntot\ntot\ntot\ntot\nopposite helicities when they propagate through 3 He target, P = (\u03c3+\n\u2212 \u03c3\u2212\n)/(\u03c3+\n+ \u03c3\u2212\n),\nwhich is related to the (~\u03c3 *~kn ) correlation. The corresponding difference of total cross sections\n\nfor a propagation of unpolarized neutrons through polarized target, the (I~ * ~kn ) correlation,\nhas the same value P in our case. It should be noted that the (~\u03c3 * ~kn ) correlation leads also\n3\n\n\fto PV neutron spin precession around the direction of neutron momentum. However, the\nangle of precession is very small (about 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u221210 rad for thermal neutrons, and it can\n\nreach the value up to about 10\u22125 rad for En \u223c 0.5 MeV for the target of the size of neutron\nmean free path), therefore, we will not consider it here. In addition, we will calculate the\nleft-right asymmetry \u03b1LR which corresponds to the PC correlation (~\u03c3 * [~kp \u00d7 ~kp ]), because it\ncould be a source of systematic effects in the measurement of \u03b1P V .\nUsing standard techniques (see, for example [6]), one can represent these asymmetries in\nterms of matrix R\u0302 which are related to reaction matrix T\u0302 and to S-matrix as:\nR\u0302 = 2\u03c0iT\u0302 = 1\u0302 \u2212 \u015c\n\n(1)\n\nThen, for our case\n\u221a\n2\n\u03b1P V = Re[\u22123 2 < 01|R1 |10 > * < 00|R0 |00>\u2217\nr\u221a\n+ ( 6 < 11|R0 |00 > +6 < 11|R1 |10 >) < 10|R1|10>\u2217 ]\n\n(2)\n\nand\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n\u03b1LR = Im[6 3 < 10|R1 |11 > * < 00|R0 |00>\u2217 + 6 3 < 11|R1 |01 > * < 10|R1 |10>\u2217\nr\n\u221a\n+ 3(2 < 11|R0|00 > + 6 < 11|R1 |10 >) < 10|R1 |11>\u2217\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+ 6 2 < 00|R0 |11 > * < 01|R1 |10>\u2217 + 6 3 < 10|R1 |01 > * < 11|R1 |10>\u2217\n\u221a\n+ 6 < 10|R1 |10 > (2 < 11|R0 |11>\u2217 + 3 < 11|R1|11>\u2217 )\n\u221a\n(3)\n+ 5 6 < 11|R2 |11 > * < 10|R1 |10>\u2217],\nwhere\nr = (| < 00|R0 |00 > |2 + 3| < 10|R1 |10 > |2 ).\n\n(4)\n\nWe use spin-channel representation, where for the matrix element < s\u2032 l\u2032 |RJ |sl >, l and l\u2032\n\nare orbital momenta of initial and final channels with corresponding spin-channels s and s\u2032 ,\nand J is the total spin of the system. For a transmission type of observable P , one obtains:\nRe[< 00|R0|11 > + < 11|R0 |00 >]\nRe[< 00|R0 |00 > +3 < 10|R1 |10 >]\n\u221a Re[< 10|R1 |01 > + < 01|R1|10 >]\n+ 3\nRe[< 00|R0 |00 > +3 < 10|R1 |10 >]\n\u221a Re[< 10|R1 |11 > + < 11|R1|10 >]\n+ 6\n.\nRe[< 00|R0 |00 > +3 < 10|R1 |10 >]\n\nP =\u2212\n\n4\n\n\fCalculations of matrix elements < s\u2032 l\u2032 |RJ |sl > for parity violating effects in nuclear\nreactions have been done [6] using distorted wave Born approximation in microscopic theory\nof nuclear reactions [7]. They lead to the symmetry violating amplitudes induced by parity\nviolating potential W\n+\nRPf iV = 2\u03c0i < \u03a8\u2212\nf |W |\u03a8i >,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a8\u00b1\ni,f are the eigenfunctions of the nuclear P-invariant Hamiltonian with the appropriate boundary conditions [7]:\n\u03a8\u00b1\ni,f =\n\nX\n\na\u00b1\nk(i,f ) (E) \u03c6k +\n\nk\n\nXZ\nm\n\n\u2032\n\u00b1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb\u00b1\nm(i,f ) (E, E ) \u03c7m (E ) dE .\n\n(6)\n\nHere, \u03c6k is the wave function of the k th resonance and \u03c7\u00b1\nm (E) is the potential scattering\nwave function in the channel m.

As\nit was shown in [6] for nuclei with rather large atomic numbers, the resonance contribution\nis dominant. Then, for the simplest case with only two resonances with opposite parities,\nthe expressions for matrix element R\u0302 for neutron-proton reaction with parity violation is:\n1\n\np\niw(\u0393nl (s)\u0393pl\u2032 (s\u2032 )) 2\nn\ne i(\u03b4l +\u03b4l\u2032 ) ,\n< s l |R |sl >= \u2212\n(E \u2212 El + i\u0393l /2)(E \u2212 El\u2032 + i\u0393l\u2032 /2)\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nJ\n\n(8)\n\nand with conservation of parity (one resonance contribution) is:\n1\n\ni(\u0393nl (s)\u0393pl\u2032 (s\u2032 )) 2 i(\u03b4ln +\u03b4p\u2032 )\nl ,\ne\n< s l |R |sl >=\n(E \u2212 El + i\u0393l /2)\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nJ\n\n(9)\n\nwhere w = \u2212 \u03c6l W \u03c6l\u2032 d\u03c4 is parity violating nuclear matrix element mixing parities of two\nR\n\nresonances. The above R\u0302 matrix elements could be represented by diagrams shown on\nFig.(1). Thus, PV asymmetry \u03b1P V is proportional to the real part the product of R\u0302 matrices\npresented by diagrams a and c, and PC asymmetry \u03b1LR is proportional to the imaginary\npart of the product of R\u0302 matrices presented by diagrams a and b (see for details [6]).\n5\n\n\ff\n\nn\n\ns\n\nf\n\na\n\nf\n\nb\n\nW\np\n\nn\n\np\n\ns\n\nn\n\nf\n\nc\n\nW\ns\n\np\n\nn\n\nd\n\nFIG. 1. Parity conserving (diagrams a and b) and parity violating (diagrams c and d) matrix\nelements of R\u0302. Symbols s and p corresponds to s- and p-wave neutrons for the initial (neutron)\nchannel, and indicate parity of the final channel.\n\nThis technique has been proven to work very well for calculation of nuclear PV effects for\nintermediate and heavy nuclei. Assuming the dominant resonance contribution to PV effects\nfor n +3 He \u21923 H + p reaction, we will apply this approach to estimate characteristic values\nof PV effects using parametrization of PV effects in terms of known resonance structure\nof the system. Fortunately, the detailed structure of resonances (4 He levels) [8] and low\nenergy neutron scattering parameters [9] are well known for this reaction from numerous\nexperiments.\nTo estimate PV and PC asymmetries in n +3 He \u21923 H + p reactions using the described\nabove formalism, we will take into account all known resonances [8, 9] which result in\nmulti-resonance representation for R\u0302 matrix elements. From the selection rules for angular\nmomenta (see Eqs. (2), (3), (5) and general expressions in [6]), one can see that for low\nenergy neutrons only resonances with the total spin of J = 0, 1 contribute to PV asymmetries\nof the interest. However, for the left-right PC asymmetry, we have to consider J = 0, 1, 2.\nThus, for PV effects we consider contributions from nine low energy resonances [8, 9] (see\nTable (II) ): one resonance with total angular momentum and parity J \u03c0 = 0+ , three with\nJ \u03c0 = 0\u2212 , four with J \u03c0 = 1\u2212 , and one with J \u03c0 = 1+ . For further calculations, we assume that\nall weak matrix elements, which mix resonances with opposite parities, have the same values\nand are described by a phenomenological formula [6] w = 2 * 10\u22124 eV\n6\n\nq\n\nD\u0304(eV ) (where D\u0304 is\n\n\fan average energy level spacing). This formula is in good agreement with other statistical\nnuclear model estimates [10\u201312] of nuclear weak matrix elements for medium and heavy\nnuclei. The extrapolation of this formula to the region of one-particle nuclear excitation\nleads to correct value for weak nucleon-nucleon interaction. Therefore, one can use this\napproximation for rough estimates of average values of weak matrix elements in few-body\nsystems. This leads to the value of weak matrix element w = 0.5 eV (with D\u0304 \u2243 6 MeV ),\nwhich is rather close to the typical value of one particle weak matrix element. One can\nsee from Eqs.(8) and (9) that the expressions for PV and PC R\u0302 matrices depend not on\nneutron and proton partial widths but on their amplitudes, the values of which depend on\nparticular spin-channels. Since we know only partial widths, we have to make assumptions\nabout values of amplitudes of partial widths for a specific spin-channel and about their\nsigns (phases). This leads to another uncertainty in our estimation in addition to the given\nabove assumption about weak matrix elements. To treat the spin-channel dependence of\npartial width amplitudes, we assume that partial widths for each spin-channel are equal to\neach other. This gives us an average factor of uncertainly of about 2. The signs of width\namplitudes, as well as the signs of weak matrix elements w, are left undetermined (random).\nThis also can lead to a factor of uncertainly of 2 or 3. Therefore, one can see that the\nuncertainly of our multi-resonance calculations is about of one order of magnitude.\n\nDISCUSSION OF RESULT OF CALCULATIONS\n\nTaking into account the considerations given above and using resonance parameters [8, 9]\nof the Table (II), one can estimate the PV asymmetry for thermal neutrons as\n\u03b1P V = \u2212(1 \u2212 4) * 10\u22127 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe set of resonance parameters of the Table (III) results in a slightly lager PV asymmetry\n\u03b1P V = \u2212(4 \u2212 8) * 10\u22127 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe difference of these two sets is related to the discrepancy between [9] and [8] for resonance\nparameters for the first positive resonance (En = 0.430 MeV ).\nThe left-right asymmetry at thermal energy is less sensitive to the parameters of this first\nresonance and has about the same value for these two sets of resonance parameters\n\u03b1LR = \u2212(2 \u2212 8) * 10\u22124 .\n7\n\n(12)\n\n\fIt should be noted that for the calculation of the left-right asymmetry, we add first three 2\u2212\nresonances [8] which do not contribute to PV effects for low energy neutrons.\nThe value of PV in neutron transmission for the first choice of parameters is\nP = \u2212(2 \u2212 4) * 10\u221210 ,\n\n(13)\n\nP = \u2212(0.8 \u2212 1.6) * 10\u221210 .\n\n(14)\n\nand for the second choice is\n\nOne can see that the parameter P is very small for neutrons with thermal energy, but it is\nessentially enhanced in a few-MeV region (see Fig.(2). The asymmetry \u03b1P V also shows a\nresonance behavior but its enhancement is not very large (see Fig.(3)).\nTo show contributions of each resonance to PV asymmetry \u03b1P V and to transmission\nparameter P , we normalized contributions from each resonance in terms of relative intensity\nto the most strong one, which is taken as 100% (see last two columns in Tables (II) and\n(III)). Some resonances contribute through two different spin-channels s = 0 and s = 1. In\nthose cases, the contributions from two spin-channels can be either with the same sign or\nwith the opposite sign, depending on unknown phases of amplitudes of partial widths and\nweak matrix elements (see, for example, resonance at 3.062 MeV in Table (II)). As can\nbe seen from these tables, different resonances contribute essentially differently to the value\nof PV violating effects (this is also correct for parity conserving asymmetries). Moreover,\ndifferent sets of resonance parameters can change weights of the resonances for a particular\nasymmetry. For example, the lowest 0\u2212 -resonance contribution to the asymmetry \u03b1P V\nappears to be 3% using the parameters of Table (II), while it would be dominant one\nusing the parameters of Table (III). This is related to the fact that for the set of Table\n(II) the contribution of the 0\u2212 -resonance to the \u03b1P V is suppressed by a factor of about 40\ndue to destructive interference between parity conserving and parity violating amplitudes.\nTherefore, the readability of this method can be essentially improved by increasing the\naccuracy in measurements of parameters of the most \"important\" resonances.\nIt should be noted that the estimated value of the PV asymmetry \u03b1P V at thermal energy\n(see Eqs. (10) and (11)) is surprisingly in very good agreement with exact calculations for\nzero energy neutrons [13]. This could be considered as an additional argument for reliability\nof the suggested resonance approach. Also, matching the estimated value of the observable\n8\n\n\fTABLE II.
