We also discuss\nthe regularity of local holomorphic coordinates in the integrable case, with particular\nattention to Lipschitz almost complex structures.\n\n1. Introduction\nIf \u03a9 is a smooth manifold of dimension 2n, an almost complex structure on \u03a9\nis a section of End(T \u03a9) such that J 2 = \u2212I. It is integrable provided there is a\nlocal coordinate chart about any p \u2208 \u03a9 consisting of holomorphic functions, where\nf : \u03a9 \u2192 C is said to be holomorphic on O \u2282 \u03a9 provided\n(1.1)\n\n(X + iJX)f = 0\n\non O for all smooth real vector fields X on O. The formal integrability condition\nis that the Lie bracket of complex vector fields of the form (1.1) continues to have\nsuch a form. Equivalently, one forms the Nijenhuis tensor:\n(1.2)\n\nN (X, Y ) = [X, Y ] \u2212 [JX, JY ] + J[X, JY ] + J[JX, Y ],\n\nwhich is linear over C 1 (\u03a9) and hence defines a tensor field. The formal integrability\ncondition is that N vanish. The Newlander-Nirenberg theorem [NN] asserts that\nformal integrability implies integrability. In [NN] is was assumed that J had a\nhigh degree of smoothness. Proofs in [NW] and [Mal] obtained the result for J \u2208\nC 1+\u03b5 , \u03b5 > 0. See also [Web]. Our goal here is to lower the needed regularity of J.\nWe will establish the following.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35N10.\nKey words and phrases.

DENSON HILL AND MICHAEL TAYLOR\n\nTheorem 1.1. If J is an almost complex structure on \u03a9, satisfying\n(1.3)\n\nJ \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p ,\n\nr + s > 1,\n\nsp > 2n,\n\nwith 0 < r < s, 1 < p < \u221e, then formal integrability implies integrability.\nHere C r is a H\u00f6lder space and H s,p is an Lp -Sobolev space. For convenience we\nwill work under the hypothesis that also s < 1. (But see some comments in \u00a75.)\nOur demonstration follows the method of [Mal], but it makes use of paraproduct\nanalysis and some elliptic regularity results that were perhaps not familiar when\nthe papers cited above were written. As a warm-up, we show that N is well defined\nwhen J satisfies (1.3). Since the components of N involve products of components\nof J and first-order derivatives of such components, it suffices to show the following.\nLemma 1.2. Assume 0 < r < s < 1 and\n(1.4)\n\nu, v \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p ,\n\nr + s > 1, 1 < p < \u221e.\n\nThen u(\u2202j v) is a well defined distribution. Furthermore, if u and v are defined on\na space of dimension m,\n(1.5)\n\nsp \u2265 m =\u21d2 u(\u2202j v) \u2208 C\u2217r\u22121 \u2229 H s\u22121,p .\n\nProof. We use the paraproduct of J.-M. Bony [Bon] to write\n(1.6)\n\nu(\u2202j v) = Tu (\u2202j v) + T\u2202j v u + R(u, \u2202j v).\n\nWe have\n(1.7)\n\n0\nu \u2208 L\u221e =\u21d2 Tu \u2208 OP BS1,1\n,\n\n0\nthe class of operators in OP S1,1\ndefined in [Mey]. See also [T], Chapter 3, whose\nnotation we follow here. Compare (1.6) with (3.5.1)\u2013(3.5.2) of [T]. Now\n\n(1.8)\n\n0\nTu \u2208 OP BS1,1\n, v \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p =\u21d2 Tu (\u2202j v) \u2208 C\u2217r\u22121 \u2229 H s\u22121,p ,\n\nwhere C\u2217s denotes the scale of Zygmund spaces, defined for s \u2208 R and coinciding\nwith H\u00f6lder space C s for s \u2208 R+ \\ Z+ . Next, if r \u2208 (0, 1),\n(1.9)\n\n1\u2212r\nv \u2208 C r =\u21d2 T\u2202j v \u2208 OP BS1,1\n\n=\u21d2 T\u2202j v u \u2208 C\u22172r\u22121 \u2229 H r+s\u22121,p ,\n\nwhen u \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p ; cf. [T], (3.5.7). Finally,\n(1.10)\n\n1\u2212r\nv \u2208 C r =\u21d2 R\u2202j v \u2208 OP S1,1\n,\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY OF ROUGH ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES\n\n3\n\nwhere we set Rg u = R(u, g) (cf. [T], (3.5.11)), and we have\n(1.11)\n\nu \u2208 H s,p =\u21d2 R\u2202j v u \u2208 H r+s\u22121,p , provided r + s \u2212 1 > 0.\n\nFor (1.5), it suffices to have H r+s\u22121,p \u2282 C\u2217r\u22121 , which holds if sp \u2265 m. This proves\nthe lemma.\nRemark 1.1. We say more about the operator results used in the proof of Lemma\nm\n1.2. A pseudodifferential operator p(x, D) is said to belong to OP S1,\u03b4\nprovided its\nsymbol p(x, \u03be) satisfies\n(1.12)\n\n|Dx\u03b2 D\u03be\u03b1 p(x, \u03be)| \u2264 C\u03b1\u03b2 (1 + |\u03be|)m\u2212|\u03b1|+\u03b4|\u03b2|.\n\nOperator results on p(x, D) include\n(1.13)\n\np(x, D) : H r+m,p \u2192 H r,p ,\n\np(x, D) : C\u2217r+m \u2192 C\u2217r ,\n\nassuming 1 < p < \u221e. If 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1, then (1.13) holds for all r \u2208 R. If \u03b4 = 1, one\nm\nneeds r > 0 for (1.13) to hold. One says p(x, D) \u2208 OP BS1,1\nprovided (1.12) holds\nwith \u03b4 = 1 and also the partial Fourier transform p\u0302(\u03b7, \u03be) satisfies\n(1.14)\n\nsupp p\u0302(\u03b7, \u03be) \u2282 {(\u03b7, \u03be) : |\u03b7| \u2264 a|\u03be|},\n\nfor some a < 1. For such operators, (1.13) holds for all r.\nRemark 1.2. Another consequence of the operator results mentioned in Remark\n1.1 is that\n(1.15)\n\nF \u2208 C \u221e , u \u2208 C\u2217r \u2229 H s,p =\u21d2 F (u) \u2208 C\u2217r \u2229 H s,p ,\n\ngiven r, s > 0, p \u2208 (1, \u221e). In fact, tools developed in [Bon] yield\n(1.16)\n\nF (u) = F (0) + M (x, D)u,\n\n0\nu \u2208 L\u221e \u21d2 M (x, D) \u2208 OP S1,1\n,\n\nand then (1.15) follows from (1.13). One can have u = (u1 , . . . , uK ), so in particular\nC\u2217r \u2229 H s,p contains uv if it contains u and v, and it also contains u\u22121 if this inverse\nis continuous.\nRemark 1.3. Our notation above does not specify domains on which elements of\nC r , H s,p , etc., are to be defined. For example, we could take C\u2217r (Rm ), H r,p (Rm ),\netc., in (1.13). Of course a nonzero constant (perhaps F (0)) does not belong\nto H s,p (Rm ), but in this context we intend to use H s,p (U ) and C r (U ) for some\nbounded U \u2282 Rm . The result (1.15) holds in this context. To justify it one extends\n\n\f4\n\nC. DENSON HILL AND MICHAEL TAYLOR\n\nu to an element of C\u2217r \u2229 H s,p on a neighborhood of U and makes use of (1.13) in\nsuch a situation, as is standard. Lemma 1.2 also holds for u, v \u2208 C r (U ) \u2229 H s,p (U ),\nand this will be useful in \u00a73.\nRemark 1.4. Another consequence of Lemma 1.2, together with Remark 1.2, is\nthat the quantity (1.2) is well defined for all vector fields X and Y that are regular\nof class C r \u2229 H s,p , under the hypothesis (1.3), and if N (X, Y ) vanishes for all\nsmooth vector fields then it vanishes for all such vector fields. This class of vector\nfields is invariant under diffeomorphisms of class C 1+r \u2229 H 1+s,p , and this fact will\nbe of use in \u00a73.\nRemark 1.5. We dwell a little on the conditions under which the regularity hypothesis (1.3) holds. Note that one special case is\n(1.17)\n\nJ \u2208 C 1/2 \u2229 H 1/2+\u03b5,4n,\n\n\u03b5 > 0.\n\nNow if\n(1.18)\n\nJ \u2208 Cr,\n\nr>\n\n1\n,\n2\n\nthen J \u2208 H 1/2+\u03b5,p for all p < \u221e as long as 1/2 + \u03b5 < r, so Theorem 1.1 applies\nwhenever (1.18) holds.\nThe following outlines the rest of this paper. In \u00a72 we rephrase the problem\nas an overdetermined system of PDEs on an open set in Cn , and give an integrability condition equivalent to N \u2261 0. In \u00a73 we discuss Malgrange's factorization\ntechnique, which is to write the local coordinate chart F = (f1 , . . . , fn ) as G \u25e6 H;\nin this section we construct H. In \u00a74 we show that the construction of G is a\nconsequence of the classical real analytic theory. All this is in direct parallel to\n[Mal], and the new material in these sections consists of demonstrations that the\nvarious steps work under our weakened regularity hypotheses. In \u00a75 we make some\nconcluding comments about the degree of regularity of the holomorphic coordinates\nwhen hypothesis (1.3) holds, and we also make special note of the situation when\nJ is Lipschitz. In such a case, we show the components of F have two derivatives\nin bmo.\n\n2. Preliminaries\nAs in [Mal], we identify a neighborhood of p in \u03a9 with a neighborhood of the\norigin 0 in Cn and arrange that J(0) coincide with the standard complex structure\non Cn . The task of solving (1.1) on a neighborhood of p for a family f1 , . . . , fn : O \u2192\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY OF ROUGH ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES\n\n5\n\nC forming a local coordinate system becomes that of solving an overdetermined\nsystem of the form\n(2.1)\n\nX\n\u2202fl\n\u2202fl\n=\najk\n,\n\u2202z j\n\u2202zk\n\n1 \u2264 j, l \u2264 n.\n\nk\n\nThe hypothesis (1.3) is equivalent to ajk \u2208 C r \u2229H s,p , with r, s, p as in the statement\nof Theorem 1.1. It will be convenient to allow a little wriggle room, when we work\nwith (3.9), so we will actually assume\n(2.2)\n\najk \u2208 C r1 \u2229 H s,p ,\n\nr1 > r,\n\najk (0) = 0.\n\nThis does not affect the validity of Theorem 1.1 as stated. The condition ajk (0) = 0\njust reflects our normalization of J(0).\nIn (2.1), zj = xj + iyj form the standard coordinates on Cn and as usual we\nset \u2202/\u2202zj = (1/2)(\u2202/\u2202xj + i\u2202/\u2202yj ), etc. A convenient shorthand is to set \u2202/\u2202z =\n(\u2202/\u2202z1 , . . . , \u2202/\u2202zn )t (a column vector), Aj = (aj1 , . . . , ajn ) (a row vector), A =\n(ajk ), and F = (f1 , . . . , fn ) (a row vector). Then (2.1) is written\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n=A\n.\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe integrability condition N \u2261 0 becomes\n(2.4)\n\n\u2202Ak\n\u2202Ak\n\u2202Aj\n\u2202Aj\n+ Aj\n=\n+ Ak\n,\n\u2202z k\n\u2202z\n\u2202z j\n\u2202z\n\n1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 n.\n\nNote that Lemma 1.2 applies directly to (2.4). The goal will be to construct a\nsolution F \u2208 C 1+r \u2229 H 1+s,p to (2.3), with F close to the identity map in C 1 -norm,\nunder the assumption that (2.4) holds. This will provide the desired holomorphic\ncoordinates.\n\n3. Malgrange factorization\nA key idea in [Mal] was to produce F in the form\n(3.1)\n\nF = G \u25e6 H,\n\nand to apply separate techniques to construct the diffeomorphisms G and H. These\nfactors will be arranged to satisfy\n(3.2)\n\n\u2202G\n\u2202G\n=B\n,\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n\n\f6\n\nC. DENSON HILL AND MICHAEL TAYLOR\n\nwith \u03b6 = H(z), and\n(3.3)\n\nh \u2202H\ni\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n+\n(B \u25e6 H) = A\n+\n(B \u25e6 H) ,\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nand furthermore it is arranged that\nX \u2202Bj\n\n(3.4)\n\nj\n\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\n= 0.\n\nHere we need to verify that the construction works under the regularity hypothesis (2.2). First, as computed in [Mal], if (3.1) holds with G, H \u2208 C 1 and if (3.2)\nholds, then (2.3) is equivalent to (3.3). For the next lemma we take r, s, p as in the\nstatement of Theorem 1.1, and we assume (2.2) holds.\nLemma 3.1. Assume H \u2208 C 1+r \u2229 H 1+s,p and that H is sufficiently close to the\nidentity in C 1 -norm, and use (3.3) to define B \u25e6 H \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p , i.e.,\n(3.5)\n\n\u0010 \u2202H\n\u2202H \u0011\u22121 \u0010 \u2202H\n\u2202H \u0011\n.\n\u2212A\n\u2212A\nB\u25e6H =\u2212\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nThen also B \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p . If A verifies the formal integrability condition (2.4), then\nso does B, i.e.,\n(3.6)\n\n\u2202Bj\n\u2202Bk\n\u2202Bj\n\u2202Bk\n+ Bj\n+ Bk\n=\n,\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6 k\n\u2202\u03b6 j\n\n1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 n.\n\nProof. As (2.4) restates the formal integrability of J, i.e., the vanishing of (1.2) for\nall vector fields X, Y \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p , the system (3.6) restates the formal integrability\ne given by\nof J,\ne = DH(z) J(z) DH(z)\u22121 , \u03b6 = H(z).\nJ(\u03b6)\nNote that under the stated regularity hypotheses on J and H we have Je \u2208 C r \u2229H s,p .\nNow the equivalence of the formal integrability of J and Je just amounts to the\ncoordinate invariance of (1.2).\nThe next result extends the scope of the lemma on p. 294 of [Mal].\nLemma 3.2. Given \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0, one can find a ball U about 0 \u2208 Cn and\n(3.7)\n\nH \u2208 C 1+r (U ) \u2229 H 1+s,p (U ),\n\nsatisfying\n(3.8)\n\nH(0) = 0,\n\nkH \u2212 idkC 1+r (U ) < \u03b4,\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY OF ROUGH ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES\n\n7\n\nand such that B \u2208 C r (U ) \u2229 H s,p (U ), defined by (3.5), satisfies |B(0)| < \u03b5 and also\nsatisfies (3.4).\nIn our proof, following [Mal], we find it convenient to fix U and dilate A, setting\nAt (z) = A(tz). Let E = B \u25e6 H, so\n(3.9)\n\n\u0010 \u2202H\n\u2202H \u0011\u22121 \u0010 \u2202H\n\u2202H \u0011\n.\nE=\u2212\n\u2212 At\n\u2212 At\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nThe map \u03a6(H, t) = E has the mapping property\n(3.10)\n\n\u03a6 : Br,s,p (\u03b4) \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 C r (U ) \u2229 H s,p (U ),\n\nwhere Br,s,p (\u03b4) consists of H \u2208 C 1+r (U ) \u2229 H 1+s,p (U ) satisfying (3.8). Then both\n\u03a6 and DH \u03a6 are continuous, where we regard our Banach spaces as real Banach\nspaces. An application of the chain rule gives\n(3.11)\n\n\u0010 \u2202K\n\u0011 \u2202E\n\u0010 \u2202K\n\u0011 \u2202E\n\u2202Bj\nj\nj\n\u25e6H =\n\u25e6H\n+\n\u25e6H\n,\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\u2202z\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\u2202z\n\nK = H \u22121 .\n\nOne can express (\u2202K/\u2202\u03b6j )\u25e6H and (\u2202K/\u2202\u03b6j )\u25e6H in terms of the z- and z-derivatives\nof H and H, using the identity\n(DK) \u25e6 H(x) = DH(x)\u22121\nof (2n) \u00d7 (2n) real matrices. It follows via Lemma 1.2 (extended to function spaces\non bounded domains) that\n(3.12)\n\n\u03a8(H, t) =\n\nX \u2202Bj\nj\n\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\n\u25e6H\n\ndefines a map\n(3.13)\n\n\u03a8 : Br,s,p (\u03b4) \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 C\u2217r\u22121 (U ) \u2229 H s\u22121,p (U ),\n\nwhich is continuous, along with DH \u03a8.

These properties of G can be established by\nextending h to a neighborhood of U , using local regularity, and then using well\nknown regularity of harmonic functions on U with boundary values in C r+1 (\u2202U ) or\ns+1\u22121/p\nBp,p\n(\u2202U ), respectively. The implicit function theorem yields for small t > 0\na solution to \u03a8(H, t) = 0 close to the solution H0 (z) = z to \u03a8(H0 , 0) = 0. This\nproves the lemma.\nRemark 3.1. It is for the continuity in t in (3.10) and (3.13) that we need r1 > r\nin (2.2). Also for this reason we need sp > 2n in (1.3), rather than the weaker\ninequality that suffices for (1.5).\n\n4. Reduction to the analytic case\nAt this point it remains to construct a diffeomorphism G \u2208 C 1+r satisfying (3.2),\nwhere B \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p satisfies (3.4) and (3.6). The key observation of [Mal] is that\nthis forces B to be real analytic. Our final task is to verify that this works under\nour weaker regularity hypothesis.\nLemma 4.1. If r, s, p satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 and (3.4) and (3.6)\nhold for B \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p , then B is real analytic, on a neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cn .\nProof. Since |B(0)| < \u03b5, the system (3.4), (3.6) is an overdetermined elliptic system\nfor B on a neighborhood of the origin. Once we show B \u2208 C \u221e , the real analyticity\nis classical. The smoothness of B follows from Theorem 2.2.E of [T], but for the\nreader's convenience we sketch a proof.\nThe overdetermined elliptic system (3.4), (3.6) has the form\n(4.1)\n\nLB + K(B, \u2207B) = 0,\n\nwhere L is a first-order linear operator (with constant coefficients, in this case)\nand K(B, \u2207B) is bilinear in its arguments. Ellipticity near z = 0 follows from\n|B(0)| < \u03b5. Using the sort of symbol smoothing discussed in Chapter 3 of [T], we\ncan write\n(4.2)\n\nK(B, \u2207B) = M # (x, D)B + M b (x, D)B,\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY OF ROUGH ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES\n\n9\n\nand, by (3.3.25) of [T], given r > 0,\n(4.3)\n\n1\u2212r\u03b4\n1\nB \u2208 C r =\u21d2 M # (x, \u03be) \u2208 S1,\u03b4\n, M b (x, \u03be) \u2208 S1,1\n.\n\n1\nHere \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) is picked in advance. Also we have L + M # (x, D) \u2208 OP S1,\u03b4\nelliptic,\n\u22121\nwith left parametrix E \u2208 OP S1,\u03b4 . Hence, if \u03b4 is close enough to 1, we have\n\n(4.4)\n\nB = \u2212E M b (x, D)B,\n\nmod C \u221e .\n\nand\n(4.5)\n\nB \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p , r + s > 1 =\u21d2 M b (x, D)B \u2208 H s+r\u03b4\u22121,p\n=\u21d2 B \u2208 H s+r\u03b4,p .\n\nWe can iterate (4.4)\u2013(4.5) arbitrarily often to obtain B \u2208 C \u221e .\nHaving Lemma 4.1, the endgame is that given in [Mal]. Since B is real analytic,\nthe Cartan-Kahler theorem implies (3.2) is solvable, for a real analytic diffeomorphism G, given the integrability condition (3.6).\n\n5. Further regularity results\nHere we make note of the regularity of the map F in terms of the hypothesized\nregularity of the almost complex structure J. Here is one result.\nProposition 5.1. Under the hypothesis (1.3) on J, when N \u2261 0, then\nF \u2208 C\u2217r+1 \u2229 H s+1,p .\n\n(5.1)\n\nOnce we show that H has this regularity, then (5.1) will follow for F = G \u25e6 H,\nas in Remark 1.2. This degree of regularity for H was indicated in Lemma 3.2, but\nto establish this lemma we raised the regularity assumed on J, in (2.2), so, shifting\nback, at this point we merely have H \u2208 C\u2217\u03c1+1 \u2229H s+1,p , for r \u2212\u03c1 = \u03b5 > 0, arbitrarily\nsmall. We will be able to go from here to (5.1) via some elliptic regularity. In fact,\nthe formulas (3.9) and (3.11) show that the condition (3.4) yields for H an elliptic\nsystem of the form\nX\n(5.2)\naj (\u2207H)\u2202j bj (\u2207H, A\u2207H) = 0,\nj\n\nwith aj and bj smooth in its arguments and\n(5.3)\n\nA \u2208 C r \u2229 H s,p ,\n\nH \u2208 C \u03c1+1 \u2229 H s+1,p ,\n\nwith r \u2212 \u03c1 = \u03b5 > 0, arbitrarily small. We continue to impose the conditions in\n(1.3) on r, s, p, and for simplicity we continue to assume 0 < r < s < 1. The\ndeduction that H \u2208 C r+1 is not a standard elliptic regularity result, but we can\nbring paraproduct techniques to bear to prove it.\nTo be sure, passing from F \u2208 C r+1\u2212\u03b5 to F \u2208 C r+1 is a small thing. In fact, the\nmain point of this section is to establish the next regularity result.\n\n\f10\n\nC. DENSON HILL AND MICHAEL TAYLOR\n\nProposition 5.2.
