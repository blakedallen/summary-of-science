Particularly, the flocculation process is important in industrial\nprocesses related to fermentation technology (brewing, wine-making, bioconversions).\nIn essence, flocculation is an ongoing process in which a yeast cell population, initially consisting entirely of single cells, is transformed into two\nfractions, flocculated and single cells. This results in a bimodal floc-size distribution (Davis and Hunt, 1986), which means that there are single cells\nand flocs with a clear dividing line between them, not a whole spectrum\nof sizes of miniflocs spreading themselves over large distances in the solute\nvolume. Also, the visual examination of single cells and small flocs falling\nunder gravity showed that large fast-moving flocs did not collide with single\ncells in their path but swept them aside in mass flows of liquid ahead of\nthe particles (Stradford, 1992). The only collision observed, and subsequent\nadhesion, were between floc particles of approximately similar sizes.\nIn the light of this evidence, Stratford (1992) proposed the cascade theory\nto approach the flocculation process. According to this theory, the particles\nonly succeed in colliding with particles of similar size. The rate-limiting step\nof the process is the combination of single cells to form doublets. Flocs then\nrapidly build up in size by combining with similar-sized flocs until they reach\nthe maximum size limit imposed by shear forces of agitation. As a consequence of rapid formation of large flocs, the relocation of the remaining single cells and floc compression elapses. The overall effect is that flocs become\nprogressively less dense and incorporate more empty space as size increases\n(Davis and Hunt, 1986). In the empty spaces of the large floc structure,\nthe remaining single cells form small clusters. Such a system showing local\nsymmetry repeated at different enlargements and scales is a fractal structure\n(Mandelbrot, 1990). The fractal dimension measured for yeast flocs confirms\nthe supercluster nature of the floc structure (Davis and Hunt, 1986), and also\nindicates that the structure was formed by a diffusion-limited process (Schaefer, 1989). Thus, the properties of the floc structure are strongly related to\ntheir microstructured morphologies resulting from a specific agglutination\nand growth process.\nSince major macroscopic features of the flocculation process seem to be\n3\n\n\fwell understood, several questions regarding the microscopic aspects of the\nprocess still remain open. For example, it is of a crucial importance to\nknow how two cells form a dimer structure? How will factors in the external\ncellular medium prevent or induce the dimer formation and which are the\nmain external factors intervening in the mechanism of dimer formation?\nWithin a fully developed yeast-culture, most cells are flocculating or retain the option to flocculate when activated by calcium ions. The flocculation\nprocess of the yeast cells requires the presence of surface proteins and mannan\nreceptors. If these are not available, or masked, blocked by binding specific\nsugars or generally inhibited or denatured, flocculation can not occur. Flocculation, once developed, is an intrinsic property of the cell wall. To sum up\nat this point, sugar-binding proteins, lectins and flocculation share the characteristics of inhibition by specific sugars and a requirement for calcium ions.\nAlso, for flocculation to be expressed, receptor groups must be available on\nthe other yeast walls to allow bonding by the flocculation protein (Stradford,\n1992).\nWe are entering an exciting phase within which links are being forged\nbetween transduction events at the plasma membrane and the surface cell\nreceptors (carbohydrate and proteins), which contribute to the onset of flocculation. Indeed, there are several transduction steps to elucidate in order to\nunderstand how the regulatory factors (antigens) act on the genes involved\nin the protein secretion, and how the secreted proteins become surface cell\nreceptors and bring about the onset of flocculation. Nevertheless, the precursor stage of dimerization, after the flocculation proteins are fully expressed\nin the cell wall but not activated yet for the flocculation onset, is rather complex. Further investigation at this stage is one pressing issue in the general\nproblem of understanding how the flocculation effectors govern the dynamics\nof the process and how can the regulation of flocculation can be controlled\nat the level of the expression of cell-surface activation abilities.\nWith this background we can state the main issues of this paper. What\nis the precursor stage of the dimer formation and how do we characterize\nit? What is the physical mechanism of the process and what mathematical\nequation governs this process?\nTo address these topics the objective of this study was twofold: First,\nwe aimed to demonstrate that the process of activation of the flocculation\nproteins can be seen in a more general context of cellular processes, that is\nthe autocrine interaction regime (Cantrell and Smith, 1984). In turn, this\n4\n\n\fwould mean flocculation has a kinetic base and informations can at least\nbe mathematically attainable on a computer (Despa and Despa, 1997). A\nsecond objective was to explore quantitatively the influence of the flocculation\neffectors on the rate of the dimer formation. Beyond this was the idea of\nvarying both the cell intrinsic parameters and external effectors to see how\nmodifying their range would affect, within the limitations of the present\napproach, the tendency of cells to form dimers.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical model\n\nIn order to achieve a rapid progress in describing flocculence, we will use in\nthe following a more simplified model which, indeed, retains the important\nfeatures observed so far.\nSuppose that the conditions for binding between specific surface lectin\nproteins of flocculent cells and carbohydrate receptors on nearby cells are fulfilled satisfied. This is the lectin-like binding hypothesis (Miki et al., 1982).\nThe surface proteins need active conformations (lectin properties) in order\nto bond to the corresponding carbohydrate receptors. This is fully ensured\nby bonding Ca2+ ions to the flocculation proteins, which lead consequently\nto their lectin (active) conformation. Note that, another hypothesis of the\ndoublet formation assumes the leading role to the calcium ions (the calciumbridging hypothesis (Harris, 1959; Mill, 1964)). There, the divalent calcium\nions form bridges between surface carboxyl or phosphate groups on different\ncells. The calcium-bridging hypothesis falls to explain the inhibition of flocculation by sugars while, the lectin-like binding hypothesis succeeded. The\nlectin-like binding hypothesis gets further support by the observation that\nvarious non-flocculent strains of yeast are able to co-flocculate when mixed\ntogether (Stradford, 1992a).\nWe recall from above that the onset of the flocculation process needs a\nprimary insertion of the flocculation proteins from the plasma membrane\ninto the cell wall and is based on the calcium-dependent interaction between\nlectins and cell wall mannan receptors. The mechanisms leading to the activation of the flocculation proteins (this implicitly assumes correct lectin\nconformation by Ca2+ binding) are largely unknown. In the following, we\npropose an activation mechanism for the flocculation proteins much in the\nsame manner as it has used to describe the activation of helper T -cells by\n5\n\n\fIL \u2212 2 growth factors (Cantrell and Smith, 1984; Despa and Despa, 1997).\nThere, the interaction between the helper T \u2212 cells and their corresponding\nIL \u2212 2 growth factors obey a self-interaction mechanism within the limit of\nthe autocrine binding regime.\nSimilarly, we assume here that the activation mechanism of the flocculation proteins and the onset of the flocculation process involve an autocrine\nbinding regime for sugar radicals and Ca2+ ions. It implies a self-interaction\nphenomenon, which means the following: The presence of sugars (and the\nother nutrients) in the autocrine region leads primarily to its consumption\nand consequent production of metabolic energy. Production of metabolic\nenergy is vital at all stages of the cell development including the protein\nencoding by flocculation genes (Novick et al., 1981). Once the flocculation\nproteins developed, these are inserted in the cell wall and, afterwards, activated by Ca2+ binding. Concomitantly, the activated surface proteins may\nbe blocked to onset flocculation by the inhibitory action of sugars. Lectins\nmay have great affinity for wort sugars but the interaction in the wall mannan of the cell with other sugar residues may be also possible. So that,\non one hand the sugar promotes flocculation by providing the cell with the\nmetabolic energy for flocculation protein formation and, on the other hand,\nit fetters the ongoing process by specific binding to the active flocculation\nproteins.\nIn the following, we consider that the surface proteins are preformed at\nan earlier stage of development and inserted in the cell wall. The abundance\nof flocculation proteins in the cell wall is direct related to the cell efficiency\nto use sugars (nutrients). We also assume that the calcium ions have the\nphysical access to the flocculation proteins. The active conformation of the\nflocculation proteins is achieved by bonding Ca2+ ions. Accordingly, we\npropose the following rate equation\ndW\n= \u03b1 + Nbound (t) \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 W (t) ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nto describe the activation of the surface proteins. The first term in the right\nside of this equation represents the cell efficiency to use sugars (nutrients)\nin order to produce the metabolic energy needed for the activation of the\nflocculation proteins. (Actually, the ratio of concentration of signal nutrient\nto sugar may conceivably influence flocculation (Stradford, 1992).) The effective value of this term accounts for the sugar depletion in unit time. The\n6\n\n\fsecond term, Nbound (t), represents the time-depending number of receptors\n(flocculation proteins) where the Ca2+ ions are bound. This depends on the\nsize of the autocrine region (i.e., the region close to the cell in which any\nCa2+ ion will be undoubtedly bound to the surface protein). The third term\nrepresents the self-interaction term, which induces a saturation effect due to\nthe extra-sugar content (\u03b1\u22121 \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03b1, in the absolute value).\nIn such a way, we may observe that the external concentration of sugar\ncontrols both early events, prior the activation, (starting the signaling cascade of proteins encoding by structural genes) and later events (e.g., the\ninhibition of the surface cell receptors). Ca2+ has the secondary role to\npromote the lectin properties of the surface proteins. Other cumbersome effects related to the cofactors action on the flocculation proteins (proteolytic\ncleavage, physical exposure) are disregarded in the present model.\nFurther on, let us consider a suspension of cells at the moment of time\nt, each of them having an average number W0 of surface proteins uniformly\ndistributed on the cell surface. We assume that the calcium ions having\nthe concentration nCa2+ move diffusively around the yeast cells. The surface\nproteins bind calcium ions from the autocrine region resulting flocculation\nproteins in active (lectin) forms. The bonding process has a certain probability P (t). The simplest choice for the binding probability in unit time\nis\n[W0 \u2212 Nbound (t)]\nP (t) =\n,\n(2)\nW0\nW0 \u2212 Nbound (t) is the number of the available receptors (surface proteins) at\nthe moment of time t. Consequently, the time variation of the number of surface proteins (receptors) where calcium ions are bound (receptor occupation),\nNbound (t) , is given by the following equation\nd\nNbound (t) = nCa2+ Var P (t) ,\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Var is the volume of the autocrine region. For numerical applications\nwe may approximate the radial dimension of the autocrine region by the\ncharacteristic Debye length (\u03bbD ). The Debye length measures the size of the\nionic cloud which surrounds the (charged) yeast cell. Doing so, Var results in\ni\n4\u03c0 h\n(R + \u03bbD )3 \u2212 R3 ,\nVar \u223c\n=\n3\n\n7\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere R is the radius of (spherical) cell. The size of the ionic cloud surrounding the cell is undoubtedly related to the pH value of the medium. Any\nchange of the pH value does affect both surface charge and Debye length\n(\u03bbD ). Implicitly, the equilibrium value of the calcium concentration around\nthe cell is changed.\nTo obtain the solution of eq. (1), which gives us the number of activated\nsurface proteins, ready for flocculation, we have to integrate numerically the\nequations system composed from eqs. (1), (2) and (3). In the assumptions\nof the present model, W0 entering eq. (2) has a constant value.\nBefore embarking on other details, we see that the activation of the surface proteins which, in turn, promotes flocculation, depends in the present\nkinetic model on: the total number of surface proteins (W0 ), the average\nconcentration of calcium ions (nCa2+ ), the rate and/or efficiency of the cell\nto use sugars and the degree of saturation of sugar content in the external\nmedium (\u03b1\u22121 ), and on the specificity of the medium (temperature, viscosity,\ncharge density on the cell membrane) by the net value of the Debye length.\nAccording to the cascade theory of flocculation the rate-limiting step of\nthe process is the combination of single cells to form doublets (Stradford,\n1992). The doublets combine to form groups of four, and on to eight, 16, 32,\n64, etc. (cascade theory). Subsequent collisions between pairs of increasingly\nlarger particles are energetically easier and are therefore not rate-limiting.\nThe rate of the dimer formation is in a direct proportion with the concentration of free cells (c0 \u2212 cf ) (where c0 is the initial concentration of free\ncells and cf stands for the dimers at the moment of time t), with the relative\nnumber of activated proteins in unit time W10 dW\nand, indeed, depends on the\ndt\nprobability that free cells collide each other under thermal motion conditions\n\u03bd. Therefore, this can be written as\ndcf \u223c 1 dW\n(c0 \u2212 cf ) \u03bd .\n=\ndt\nW0 dt\n\n(5)\n\nThe number of collisions which occur between molecules in a fluid system\ncan be calculated from a complex function (Chapman and Cowling, 1970)\ndepending, mainly, on the temperature T and on the viscosity of the medium.\nThis resolves to\n1\n(6)\n\u03bd = aT 2 ,\nwhere a is a constant measured in appropriate units.\n8\n\n\f3\n\nResults\n\nThe present model assumes that yeast flocculation is an kinetic process depending on several effectors. The effectors may change both the initial rate\nof flocculation and the net value of the content of remaining free cells. Their\ninfluence will be examined in the following. The initial number of free cells\nwas set at 109 per litter and any cell division was disregarded at the present\nlevel of approximation. Also, we assumed that each yeast cell has approximate 106 surface proteins. The cell is considered as having a spherical form\nwith the radius equal to about 5 \u03bcm.\n3.0.1\n\nCell efficiency to use sugar/nutrients\n\nWe proceeded to integrate numerically (5) over a wide interval of time, between 0 and 100 (arbitrary) time units. The calcium content is maintained\nat a constant value nCa2+ = 3.1 1021 ions per unit volume. The Debye length\nwas set at \u03bbD = 0.1 \u03bcm and, for simplicity, \u03bd equal to unity. Generally,\nwe observed that the flocculation process proceeds from a high initial rate\nwhich progressively declines until a steady state is reached where no further\nflocculation occurs, leaving a small fraction of free cells. This general behavior agrees with the experimental observations (see Stradford, 1992 and\nreferences therein). Specifically, in Fig. 1 we may see the behavior of the free\ncells concentration, c0 \u2212 cf , for two different values of the \u03b1 parameter. For\n\u03b1 = 0.9, which means an almost ideal efficiency of cell to use sugar/nutrients,\nwe can see a high initial rate of flocculation. The steady\nstate is achieved\n\u0010\n\u0011\nc0 \u2212cf\nrelatively soon and is characterized by a small fraction c0 \u2243 10\u22124 of free\ncells. (The last result is not evident from Fig. 1 .) Lowering the efficiency\nof yeast cell to use sugar/nutrients to \u03b1 = 0.5, the value of the remaining\nfree\ncells fraction\nis drastically enhanced about three orders of magnitude\n\u0011\n\u0010\nc0 \u2212cf\n\u22121\n. In the latter case, the initial rate of flocculation is dramati\u2243 10\nc0\ncally changed, the slope being modified with about 20%.\n3.0.2\n\nCalcium content\n\nIn the following, we will keep the efficiency parameter at a constant value\n(\u03b1 = 0.5). The concentration of the calcium ions is now varied while, all\nthe parameters in above remain at their previous values. We increased the\n9\n\n\fcalcium content of three times, from 3.1 1021 ions to 9.3 1021 ions per unit\nvolume. Looking at Fig. 2, we may observe that the initial rate of flocculation\nis strongly influenced by the calcium content, as we just expected. Supplying\nthe calcium content at the initial stage of evolution of the cell culture, the\nactivation rate of the surface proteins is sped up resulting in a more rapid\nflocculation process. The steady state free cells fraction is almost the same\nfor both calcium contents.\nThe same effect, as above, can be achieved by changing the Debye length\nand, implicitly, the volume of the autocrine region. (In the practicality the\nDebye length should be related to the pH value in the external medium.)\n\n4\n\nFinal remarks\n\nAlthough sporadic flocculation may appear even from an earlier stage of the\nyeast culture development, it is actually initiated after the growth process\nceased. The quantity of free cells in solution decreases sharply after a certain\ntime has elapsed. Under brewing conditions, the initiation of this process is\ntriggered after the growth limitation proceeded by a limited oxygen supply\n(i.e., oxygen saturation of the wort at the beginning of fermentation), as it\nwas shown recently (Straver et. al, 1993a). The CO2 formation during the\nfermentation produces a natural agitation among the suspended cells that\nis a causal factor in flocculation. Agitation causes rapid and progressive\nflocculation but, if at any time, due to various reasons, agitation ceased,\nflocculation stopped (Stradford, 1987). In the present model, the above\nobservation can be easy correlated with the appropriate number of collisions\n\u03bd, which occur between cells in the suspension. By increasing \u03bd the rate of\nflocculation goes into higher values.\nOn the other hand, the delay in the initiation of flocculence has been\nseen as an expression of the fact that the synthesis of the lectin involved\nin flocculation of brewer's yeast is not regulated during the growth process\n(Straver et. al, 1993a). This observation indicates that the regulation of\nflocculation might be controlled at the level of the expression of cell-surface\nactivation abilities. Characterization and regulation of flocculation at this\nlevel of surface cell activation is a real challenge in the development of industrially feasible methods for manipulating yeast-cell components in order to\ncontrol flocculence during fermentation. The theoretical model of floccula10\n\n\ftion developed in the present paper offers, at a certain extent, an useful tool\nfor further investigations on this line.\nMoreover, a sum of other similar biological processes can be described\nby using the present kinetic approach. For example, the adhesion of yeast\ncells to carbon dioxide bubbles (flotation) in the wine-making technology or\nthe binding of cells to the matrix and to microorganisms that have already\nadhered can be subject of the present approach.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\nCantrell, D.
