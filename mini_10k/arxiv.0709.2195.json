However, Spergel et al. (2007) have shown that CMB studies can not\nsupply strong constraints on the value of H0 on their own. This problem occurs due to\nthe high degree of degeneracy on the parameter space (Tegmark et al 2004), and may be\ncircumvented only by using independent measurements of H0 (Hu 2005, Cunha et al. 2007).\nIn these circumstances, it is particularly relevant to obtain accurate and independent bounds\non the value of H0 from physics relying on many different kinds of observations.\nOn the other hand, with the new optical and infrared techniques together the recent\nadvent of large telescopes became possible to estimate the ages of high redshift objects like\ngalaxies and quasars. The subsequent discovery of some evolved high-z objects (Dunlop et\nal. 1996, Spinrad et al. 1997; Bruzual & Magris 1997; Dunlop 1999; Nolan et al. 2001)\nhave been used by many authors to put limits on the cosmological parameters. Alcaniz and\nLima (1999, 2001), by using only two old (extremely red) high redshift galaxies (53W091\nand 53W069) dated by Dunlop and collaborators obtained \u03a9\u039b \u2265 0.5 for a flat \u039bCDM model,\na result more stringent than the ones derived from Type Ia Supernovae. They also derived\nlimits on the cosmic equation of state parameter by considering a flat cosmology driven by\ncold dark matter and a X-matter dark energy component (p = \u03c9\u03c1, \u03c9 = constant). As a\nconclusion, it was argued that if the ages of those objects were correctly estimated, the first\nformation era is pushed back to extremely high redshifts. Hasinger, Schartel and Komossa\n(2002) also reported the discovery of the quasar APM 08729 + 5255 at z = 3.91 with an\nestimated age of 2-3 Gyr. Later on, this result was independently confirmed by Fria\u00e7a et\nal. (2005) by using a chemodynamical model for the evolution of spheroids. They shown\nthat a minimal age of 2.1 Gyr is set by the condition that the Fe /O abundance ratio of\nthe model reaches 3.3 (normalized to solar values) which is the best fit values obtained by\nHasinger and coworkers. Further, several authors have also claimed that the quasar APM\n08729 + 5255 is an extremely stringent object for any realistic cosmological model (Alcaniz,\nLima & Cunha 2003; Cunha & Santos 2004, Deepak and Dev 2006). In this regard, it is of\nparticular interest the sample of 20 old passive galaxies published by the team of the Gemini\nDeep Deep Survey (GDDS). As noticed by McCarthy et al. (2004), such data are strongly\nsuggesting that the galaxies have been evolving passively since their initial burst of star\nformation. More recently, the GDDS sample has been used by Dantas et al. (2007) to put\nconstraints on the dark energy equation of state (w) through a joint analysis involving the\ninferred lookback time measurements from the ages of the galaxies plus the total expanding\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nage of the Universe as obtained from CMB data.\nIn this letter, we derive new constraints on the Hubble constant H0 , by using the GDDS\nsample complemented by two additional data set recently released (Roche et al. 2006,\nLonghetti et al. 2007). A statistical age test is performed to constrain the (h, \u03a9m ) plane\nassuming that the Universe is well described by the cosmic concordance model (\u039bCDM). Due\nto a degeneracy on the space parameter, more stringent constraints are obtained through a\njoint analysis involving the different OHRGs samples and the current SDSS measurements\nof the baryon acoustic peak (Eisenstein et al. 2005). In this concern, we recall that the\nbaryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) method is independent of the Hubble constant H0 but\nit is heavily dependent on the value of \u03a9M , and, as such, it contributes indirectly to fix\nthe value of H0 . Therefore, one can apply the BAO signature to break the degeneracy of\nthe mass density parameter (\u03a9M ). The BAO signature comes out because the cosmological\nperturbations excite sound waves in the relativistic plasma, thereby producing the acoustic\npeaks in the early universe. Eisenstein et al. presented the large scale correlation function\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) showing clear evidence for the baryon acoustic\npeak at 100h\u22121 Mpc scale, which is in excellent agreement with the WMAP prediction from\nthe CMB data. As we shall see, both set of data (OHRG sample and BAO signature) provide\nan interesting method to constrain the Hubble constant.\n\n2.\n\nBasic Equations and Sample\n\nLet us now consider that the Universe is described by a flat Friedmann-RobertsonWalker (FRW) geometry (c = 1)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t) dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6) ,\n(1)\n\nas theoretically predicted by inflation and required by the WMAP observations (Spergel et\nal. 2003; 2007).\nIn such a background, the age-redshift relation for a model driven by cold dark matter\nplus a cosmological constant (\u039bCDM) has only two free parameters (H0 , \u03a9M ). It can be\nwritten as\nZ (1+z)\u22121\ndx\n\u22121\np\nt(z; h, \u03a9M ) = H0\n,\n(2)\nx \u03a9M x\u22123 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9M )\n0\n\nwhere h = H0 /100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and from now on the subscript 0 denotes present day\nquantities. Note that for \u03a9M = 1 the above expression reduces to the well known result\nfor Einstein-de Sitter model (CDM, \u03a9M = 1) for which t(z) = 32 H0\u22121 (1 + z)\u22123/2 . As one\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmay conclude from the above equation, limits on the cosmological parameters \u03a9M and H0\n(or equivalently h), can be derived by fixing t(z) from observations. Note also that the age\nparameter, T = H0 tz , depends only on the product of the two quantities H0 and tz , which\nare usually estimated from completely independent methods (Alcaniz & Lima 1999).\nMcCarthy et al. sample (2004) is constituted by 20 red galaxies on the interval 1.3 < z <\n2.2 selected from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS). This sample consists of passively\nevolving galaxies whose most likely star formation evolution is that of a single burst of\nduration less than 0.1 Gyr (also consistent with 0 Gyr), thereby meaning that the galaxies\nevolved passively since their first star burst formation. Another data set of interest is the\nRoche et al (2006) sample, which consists of 16 Extremely Red Galaxies (ERGs), formed\nby ellipticals, mergers and red spirals at 0.87 < z < 2.02. The authors have determined a\ndeep spectroscopic survey of these galaxies on the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\n(GOODS)-South Field by using the Gemini multi-object spectrograph on the 8-m Gemini\nSouth Telescope. They also performed an age-dating analysis by fitting the spectra and\nnine-band photometry (BV IZJHK, plus 3.6/4.5-\u03bcm fluxes from Spitzer) of the ERGS with\ntwo-component models, consisting of passively evolving, old stellar populations combined\nwith a younger continuously star forming component. The best-fitting mean ages for the\nold stellar populations range from 0.6 to 4.5 Gyr with an average value of 2.1 Gyr. The\nthird set of data worked here is the Longhetti et al. (2007) sample, composed of nine field\ngalaxies spectroscopically classified as early-types at 1.2 < z < 1.7. They result from a nearIR spectroscopic follow-up of a complete sample of bright ERGs selected from the Munich\nNear-IR Cluster Survey (MUNICS) that provides optical (B, V, R, I) and near-IR (J and K')\nphotometry. The ages of the galaxies were estimated by making use of stellar populations\nwith the degeneracy between the age of the best-fitting models and the star formation time\nscale being broken through a mass-weighting of the masses. As one may check, this sample\nprovides the most accurate ages and the most restricting galaxies.\nIn Fig. 1 we show a plot of the age as a function of the redshift for all objects present\non the above quoted samples. However, since the galaxy formation is a random process it\nis not interesting to consider only the ages of all objects in order to constrain the model\nparameters. One basic reason comes from the fact that whether a universe model is capable\nof explaining the existence of a very old object for a given value of z, it explains more easily\nthe age of the youngest objects at that redshift. With basis on this kind of criterion we have\nselected a more restrictive subsample involving only the oldest objects for a fixed redshift\ninterval. The complete subsample chosen from the 3 set of data is constituted by 13 galaxies.\nAs can be seen in the above quoted papers, some galaxies have asymmetric age uncertainties,\nso we have used the D'Agostini (2004) method to symmetrize it in order to perform a \u03c72\nstatistical analysis.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 we show the selected subsample and the predictions of several \u039bCDM\nmodels, in order to verify visually the concordance with the data and the effects of the\ndifferent parameters (h and \u03a9M ).\n\n3.\n\nStatistical Analysis and Results\n\nNow, let us perform a \u03c72 fit over the h \u2212 \u03a9M plane. To begin with, we first consider\nthat the actual ages of the objects at a given redshift are tz = tobs\ng + tinc , where tinc is the\nincubation time of the galaxy. This quantity is an estimate of the amount of time interval\nfrom the beginning of structure formation process in the Universe until the formation time\n(tf ) of the object itself. It is also assumed that tinc varies slowly with the galaxy and redshift\nin our sample, and, in order to account for our ignorance about this kind of \"nuisance\"\nparameter, we associate a reasonable uncertainty, say, \u03c3tinc (Fowler 1986, Sandage 1993). In\nwhat follows, we consider that tinc = 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 Gyr. Following standard lines, the maximum\n\u0002\n\u0003\nlikelihood, L \u221d exp \u2212\u03c72age (z; p, tinc )/2 , is determined by a \u03c72 statistics\n\u03c72age (z|p) =\n\nX (t(zi ; p) \u2212 tobs,i \u2212 tinc )2\ni\n\n\u03c3t2obs,i + \u03c3t2inc\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p \u2261 (h, \u03a9m ) is the complete set of parameters, tobs,i is the observational age for a\nspecific galaxy, \u03c3tobs,i is the uncertainty in the individual age, \u03c3tinc is the above assumed\nuncertainty of the incubation time.\nIt now proves convenient both from a qualitative and a methodological viewpoint to\nconsider first the old galaxy age test separately. Further, we present a joint analysis including\nthe BAO signature from the SDSS catalog. It is worth noticing that a specific flat cosmology\nhas not been fixed by hand in the analyzes below.\n\n3.1.\n\nLimits from Old Galaxies\n\nLet us now consider the selected 13 galaxies which constitute the more stringent old\ngalaxies present in the original samples. For the sake of definiteness this is the sample\nadopted for deriving all the limits in this work. In principle, it is reasonable to think that\nold galaxies at high-z alone can not put very tight constraints on the pair (h, \u03a9M ). One of\nthe main reasons is that the galaxy formation is a random event, and, as such, it is hard to\nknow the correct values of the incubation time for each galaxy.

Different\nfrom the previous figure, now we have plotted models with h = 0.72, as favored by the HST\nKey Project, for selected values of the density parameter. For smaller values of \u03a9M the ages\nincrease thereby accommodating the oldest selected objects.\n\n2.2\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nIn Fig. 4 we show the contours of constant likelihood (68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7% c.l.)\nin the space parameter h \u2212 \u03a9M for the age data alone. Note that all the parameter space\nfor h and \u03a9M is allowed, with a weak constraint \u03a9M & 0.02 and h & 0.34. In this case,\nthe best fit parameters derived are h = 1.11 and \u03a9M = 0.09 with a \u03c72min = 11.2, however,\nthese values are meaningless because many others pairs of (h, \u03a9M ) are also allowed with\nconsiderable statistical meaning. For example, by fixing \u03a9M = 0.3 we have h = 0.68 with\n\u03c72min = 11.4, and if \u03a9M = 1.0 we have h = 0.67, and both cases are permitted with high\ndegree of confidence. Clearly, one may conclude that an additional cosmological test (fixing\n\u03a9M ) is necessary in order to break the degeneracy on the (h, \u03a9M ) plane.\n\n3.2.\n\nOld Galaxies and BAO: A Joint Analysis\n\nAs suggested earlier, more stringent constraints on the space parameter (\u03a9M , h) can be\nderived by combining the selected sample of old galaxies with the BAO signature (Eisenstein\net al. 2005). According to cold dark matter (CDM) picture of structure formation, the largescale fluctuations have grown since z \u223c 1000 by gravitational instability. The cosmological\nperturbations excited sound waves in the primeval plasma, thereby producing the acoustic\npeaks in the early universe. The peak detected (from a sample of 46748 luminous red\ngalaxies selected from the SDSS Main Sample) is predicted to arise precisely at the measured\nscale of 100 h\u22121 Mpc. Basically, it is a consequence of the baryon acoustic oscillations in\nthe primordial baryon-photon plasma prior to recombination. Let us now consider it as\nan additional cosmological test over the age redshift test. As it is widely known, such a\nmeasurement can be characterized by the dimensionless parameter\n1/2\n\nA\u2261\n\n\u03a9M\n\nH(z\u2217 )1/3\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u0393(z\u2217 )\nz\u2217\n\n\u00152/3\n\n= 0.469 \u00b1 0.017,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere z\u2217 = 0.35 is the redshift at which the acoustic scale has been measured, and \u0393(z\u2217 )\nis the dimensionless comoving distance to z\u2217 . The quantity H(z\u2217 ) corresponds to H(z)/H0 ,\nwhich, in a \u039bCDM flat cosmology reads:\nH = [\u03a9M (1 + z)3 + 1 \u2212 \u03a9M ]1/2\n\n(5)\n\nNote that the quantity given by (4) is independent of the Hubble constant and, as such,\nthe BAO signature alone constrains only the \u03a9M parameter. However, as can be seen from\nFig. 3, the value of h is heavily dependent on \u03a9M thereby leading to a tighter constraint\nin the distance scale. This property is very characteristic of the BAO signature thereby\ndifferentiating it from many others classical cosmological tests, like the gas mass fraction\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n1.4\n\nOld Galaxies\n\n-1\n\nh (H /100kms Mpc )\n\n1.2\n\n99.7%\n\n-1\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\no\n\n95.4%\n\n0.6\n68.3%\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nM\n\nFig. 4.- Confidence regions (68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7%c.l.) in the (\u03a9m , h) plane provided\nby the Ages of 13 Old Galaxies at High Redshift.

The shadow lines are\ncuts in the regions of 68.3% and 95.4% probability. We see that the region permitted is well\nconstrained and in concordance with others studies (Freedman et al. 2001; Spergel et al.\n2006).\n\n1.0\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n(Lima et al. 2003; Allen et al. 2004), luminosity distance (Peebles & Ratra 2003), the age\nof the universe (Alcaniz et al. 2003; Lima 2004; Cunha & Santos 2004; Jesus 2006), angular\ndiameter versus redshift (Lima & Alcaniz 2000; 2005), and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect\n(Cunha et al. 2007).\nIn Fig. 5, we show the confidence regions for the age redshift relation and BAO joint\nanalysis. By comparing with Fig. 4, one may see how the BAO signature breaks the degeneracy in the (\u03a9M , h) plane. As it appears, the BAO test presents a striking orthogonality\ncentered at \u03a9M = 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 with respect to the age redshift data as determined from old\nGalaxies at High Redshift. We find h = 0.71 \u00b1 0.04 and \u03c72min = 11.38 at 68.3% (c.l.) and\n95.4% (c.l.), respectively, for 1 free parameter. An important lesson here is that the combination of old galaxies with BAO provides one more interesting approach to constrain the\nHubble constant. In Fig. 6, by projecting over \u03a9M , we have plotted the likelihood function\nfor the h parameter based on our joint analysis involving the BAO signature plus the OHRG\ndata. The dotted lines are cuts in the regions of 68.3% probability and 95.4%.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, the present results are in line with some recent analyzes\nbased on different cosmological observations, like the one provided by the HST Project\n(Freedman et al. 2001) and the WMAP team (Spergel et al. 2007). Note, however, that it is\njust marginally compatible with the determination advocated by Sandage and collaborators\n(2006), a result obtained with basis on Type Ia Supernovae calibrated with Cepheid variables\nin nearby galaxies that hosted them. Jimenez et al. (2003) also obtained an independent\nestimate of the Hubble constant by computing dz/dt at z \u223c 0 for a sample of galaxies\nfrom Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By assuming a \u039bCDM concordance model, they\nobtained H0 = 69 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . More recently, Cunha, Marassi & Lima (2007) have\nfound h = 0.74+0.04\n\u22120.03 and \u03a9M = 0.28 \u00b1 0.04 at 68% c.l. through a joint analysis involving\nthe Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZe), X-ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters and baryon\nTable 1.

They have also assumed a \u039bCDM flat cosmology. The present result\nis in perfect agreement with their analysis with a high degree of statistical confidence (both\nanalyzes are compatible even at 68% c.l.). Perhaps more important, the result is heavily\ndependent on the combination of the samples. For instance, if we have taken only the Roche\net al. sample (the less restrictive one), after the joint analysis with BAO, the best fit increases\nto h = 0.99 (h = 0.77 for the McCarthy et al. data).\nIt is also worth noticing that the best-fit scenario derived here, \u03a9M = 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 and\nh = 0.71\u00b10.04, corresponds to an accelerating Universe with q0 = \u22120.58, a total evolutionary\nage of to \u2243 9.6h\u22121 Gyr, and a transition redshift (from deceleration to acceleration) zt \u2243 0.72.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nSince the original work of Hubble, the precise determination of the distance scale, H0 ,\nhas been a recurrent problem in the development of physical cosmology. In this letter\nwe have derived new constraints to the Hubble constant based on a statistical analysis of\nAges of Old Galaxies at High Redshifts. Our analysis revealed that with basis only on\nthe present age-redshift data of old galaxies it is not possible to obtain tight constraints\non H0 due to the dependence of t(z) with the \u03a9M parameter (see Fig. 4). However, the\ndegeneracy on the \u03a9M \u2212h plane has been broken trough a joint analysis involving the baryon\nacoustic oscillation signature from the SDSS catalog (see Fig. 5). The Hubble constant was\nconstrained to be h = 0.71 \u00b1 0.04 (1\u03c3). These limits were derived assuming an incubation\ntime tinc = 0.8 \u00b1 0.4Gyr and a flat \u039bCDM scenario.\nAs we have seen, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide an interesting tool for\nconstraining directly the mass density parameter, \u03a9M , and, indirectly, it also improves the\nHubble constant limits acquired from other cosmological techniques (like the age-redshift\nrelation). Our Hubble constant estimation through a joint analysis involving old high redshift galaxies plus BAO is in good agreement with independent estimates based on different\ncosmological observations, like the third year of the WMAP and the HST Key Project.\nIndirectly, such an agreement suggests that the incubation time we have assumed is quite\nrealistic. It also reinforces the interest to the observational search of old galaxies at high\nredshifts in the near future, when more and larger samples, smaller statistical and systematic\nuncertainties can improve the limits on the present value of the Hubble parameter.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to L.
