This requires that the bunch centre of mass that enters the cavity at the instant\nt = 0 and would leave the cavity at t = \u03c4RF , at magnetic field values, respectively\nBy (0, 0) = \u2212B0 db\n\nand\n\nBy (d, \u03c4RF ) = B0 db\n\n(35)\n\nThe field values at both ends fade rapidly to zero over a small distance |\u03b4| just\noutside the cavity (see Figures.) We may consider these fringe fields as small-valued\nfunctions in the (y, z)-plane, since the time \u03b4t necessary for a particle to proceed\n7\n\n\fthrough this distances can be very small in comparison with \u03c4RF , depending of course\nby the size of the beam channel, or\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n[By ]in\n\n= \u2212B0 db g(z) with g(\u2212\u03b4) = 0, g(0) = 1\n\n[By ]out =\n\nB0 db\n\nwith h(d) = 1,\n\nh(z)\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nh(d + \u03b4) = 0\n\nUnder these conditions, a relativistic fermion with its spin directed along the y-axis\nand traversing the cavity will experience a SG force parallel to the z-axis (direction\nof motion), see Eq.(10)\nfz = \u03bc\u2217 Czy\n(37)\nwhere Czy is given by the second of the set of Eqs.(11). For the moment we assume\nthat the spin will conserve its orientation during traversal\nThe electric field Ex and its derivatives in this equation are almost constantly\nzero, because of the boundary conditions on the walls of the\u0010 cavity\n\u0011 and at the extreme\n\u2202By\npoints z = \u2212\u03b4 and z = d + \u03b4. Furthermore, the function \u2202t is almost zero along\nthe fringe segments because of its proportionality to sin \u03c9t, with t equal to the \u03b4t\nmentioned before. Consequently we have\ny\nCzy \u2243 \u03b3 2 \u2202B\n,\n\u2202z\n\n(38)\n\nand for the entire fringe field\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n[fz ]in\n\n= \u2212B0 \u03bc\u2217 db \u03b3 2\n\n[fz ]out =\n\nB0 \u03bc\u2217 db \u03b3 2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\ndg(z)\ndz\n\ndh(z)\ndz\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\n\u0011\n\nMaking use of eqs. (38) and (39), the energy increments\n[\u03b4U]in and [\u03b4U]\nrelated\nR0\nR d+\u03b4out\nto the fringe fields are easily evaluated since the integrals \u2212\u03b4 fz dz and d fz dz only\ndepend upon the extreme points (36) and do not depend on the curve that connects\nthem. In fact fz dz becomes an exact differential. Then we obtain for the energy\nexchange at both edges\n(\u03b4U)in = (\u03b4U)out = \u2212B0 \u03bc\u2217 db \u03b3 2 .\n\n(40)\n\nThe total energy exchange at the edges is therefore\n(\u03b4U)ff = (\u03b4U)in + (\u03b4U)out = \u22122B0 \u03bc\u2217 db \u03b3 2 .\n\n3.2\n\n(41)\n\nFull energy interaction\n\nBy adding the fringe contributions (41) to the cavity body crossing contribution (34)\nseen before, obtain\nb\n(\u03b4U)tot = (\u03b4U)ff + (\u03b4U)X = \u2212\u03b3 2 B0 \u03bc\u2217 f (\u03b2ph , \u03b2)\nd\n8\n\n(42)\n\n\fwith\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\nf (\u03b2ph , \u03b2) = 2 \u2212\n\n2\n\n\u03b2 (2\u2212\u03b2 )\u22121\n\u03b2 2 ph\u03b2 2 \u2212\u03b2 2\nph\n\n\u0010\n\n1 + cos\n\n\u03b2ph\n\u03c0\n\u03b2\n\nFor ultra relativistic particles (\u03b2 \u2243 1) Eq.

In fact, if we set\n\u03b2ph = 2\n\nd = 21 \u03bbwg = \u03bbRF\n\n=\u21d2\n\n(45)\n\nthe total energy contribution (44) vanishes, implying a full cancellation of the effect.\nOn the other hand if we set\n\u03b2ph = 3\n\nd = 21 \u03bbwg = 23 \u03bbRF\n\n=\u21d2\n\n(46)\n\nthe total energy contribution (44) becomes\n(\u03b4U)tot \u2243 \u22122\u03b3 2 B0 \u03bc\u2217 db\n\n(47)\n\nas deduced from Eq.(28). In Table I we gather values calculated from Eq.(43) for\nnon-relativistic and ultra-relativistic particles for, either \u03b2ph = 2 or \u03b2ph = 3 at two\nproton energies. Each \u03b2ph is accompanied by the corresponding ratio cavity-length\nover cavity-height.\nTable I: f (\u03b2ph , \u03b2)\n\u03b2ph \u21d2\n\nd\nb\n\nLow Energy\n(e.g. Wkin = 5 MeV)\n2 \u21d2 1.732\n2.01\n3 \u21d2 2.828\n2.02\n\nHigh Energy\n(e.g. Wkin = 30 GeV)\n0\n2\n\nFurthermore, if we consider two contiguous cavities, there will be a gradient between the positive By at the end of the first cavity and a negative By at the beginning\nof the second cavity, as shown in Fig. 4.

A spin\nrotator[6] can align the particle magnetic moments either parallel or anti-parallel\nto the directions of the magnetic field gradients, thus allowing the desired energy\ninteraction. This situation would be similar to what happens in a multi-stage tandem\nvan de Graaff, where the ions are repetitively accelerated by the same electrostatic\nfield, becoming alternatively negative, via an addition of electrons, or positive, via\nelectron stripping.\nUnfortunately, the field integral (BM d = \u03b2\u03c0 mc\n= \u03b2 5.46 Tm, for p, p\u0304) for attaining\nae\na spin rotation is so large that this solution is unpractical. Instead, the example\nof \u03b2ph equal to an odd number seems much more suitable since does not require\ncumbersome magnets, but only longer cavities (compare Eqs. (45) and (46)). In\nfact, the magnetic moments are (de)accelerated by the field tails at the cavity ends,\nwhile don't change their energy when crossing the cavities. This situation resembles\nthe Wideroe linac where the charged particles are accelerated by the electric fields\nbetween two contiguous drift tubes, but don't change their energy while crossing the\ntubes themselves.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOn the basis of the previous estimates, we feel ready to propose the time varying SG\ninteraction as a method for attaining a spin state separation of an unpolarized beam\nof, say (anti)protons, since the energy of particles with opposite spin orientations will\ndiffer and beams in the two states can be separated. In a first stage of the study of a\nsensible practical design, we intend to proceed with numerical simulations. As a first\nstep, we intend to verify the correctness of Eqs.(42) and (43) setting once \u03b2ph = 2 and\nthen \u03b2ph = 3, in a cavity where the field line pattern can be realistically controlled.\nBeyond the verification of the present theory, there is also the aim of studying the\neffects generated by the spin precession inside the cavity, that we did not yet address\nin this note.\nNext, we shall consider a spin splitter scheme based on the lattice of an existing or\nplanned (anti)proton ring endowed with an array of splitting cavities. The principal\naim of the latter implementations is to check the mixing effect[7][8] of the longitudinal\nphase-plane filamentation, i.e. the actual foe which could frustrate the entire spin\nsplitting process.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFirst, we want to thank Waldo MacKay, who has participated on so many discussions\non the whole idea but who was regrettably prevented by numerous commitments from\nparticipate to the editing of the present note.
