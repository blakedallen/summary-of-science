In view of the example of black hole entropy, Bekenstein proposed\na universal entropy bound S \u2264 2\u03c0ER for a weak self-gravitating physical system with total energy E and size R in 1981 [1]. Later 't Hooft and Susskind proposed an influential\nholographic principle, relating the maximum number of degrees of freedom in a volume to\nits boundary surface area[2]. The extension of the holographic principle to the cosmological\nsetting was first addressed by Fischler and Susskind (FS) [3]. Subsequently, various modifications of the FS version of the holographic principle was proposed [4]. The idea of the\nholographic principle is viewed as a real conceptual change in our thinking about gravity\n[5]. It has appeared many examples of applying the holographic principle to study cosmology, such as understanding the possible value of the cosmological constant [6][7], selecting\nphysically acceptable model in inhomogeneous cosmology [8] and discussing upper limits on\nthe number of e-foldings in inflation [9]. It is of great interest to generalize the application\nof holography to a much broader class of situations, especially to cosmology.\nThe type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations suggest that the Universe is dominated\nby dark energy with negative pressure which provides the dynamical mechanism of the\naccelerating expansion of the Universe [10, 11]. The simplest candidate of dark energy is\nthe cosmological constant. However the unusual small value of the cosmological constant\nis a big challenge to theoretical physicists. Whether holography can shed us some light\nin understanding the profound puzzle posed by the dark energy is a question we want to\nask. Motivated by the assumption that for any state in the Hilbert space with energy E,\nthe corresponding Schwarzschild radius Rs \u223c E is less than the infrared (IR) cutoff L [7],\na relationship between the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff and the infrared cutoff is derived, i.e.,\n8\u03c0GL3 \u03c1D /3 \u223c L [7]. We can express the holographic dark energy density as\n\u03c1D =\n\n3c2 d2\n,\n8\u03c0GL2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and d is a constant of the order of unity. This UV-IR relationship\nwas also obtained by Padmanabhan by arguing that the cosmological constant is due to the\nvacuum fluctuation of energy density. Hsu found that the holographic dark energy model\nbased on the Hubble scale as the IR cutoff won't give an accelerating universe [12]. In [13],\n2\n\n\fLi showed that choosing the particle horizon as the IR cutoff, an accelerating universe will\nnot be produced either. However, by relating the IR cutoff to an event horizon, it was\nfound that the holographic dark energy model can accommodate the accelerating universe\n[13, 14]. The model in the flat universe was found in consistent with current observations\n[15]. Here we would like to point out that the form \u03c1D \u223c H 2 also works for dark energy\n\nmodel building. For example, the model \u03c1D = \u03c1\u039b + 3c2 d2 H 2 /(8\u03c0G) with \u03c1\u039b a constant\n\nderived from the re-normalization group models of the cosmological constant can explain\nthe accelerating expansion of the Universe [16]. Ito also discovered a viable holographic dark\nenergy model by using the Hubble scale as the IR cutoff with the use of non-minimal coupling\nto scalar field [17]. More recently, a dark energy model \u03c1D \u223c H 2 with an interaction between\nthe dark energy and dark matter was proposed to explain the accelerating expansion [18].\nThe holographic dark energy model in the framework of Brans-Dicke theory was discussed\nin [19]. Some speculations about the deep reasons of the holographic dark energy were\nconsidered by several authors [20]. The holographic principle was also used to constrain\ndark energy models in [21]. In this paper, we reexamine the holographic dark energy model\nproposed in [13]. We give constraints on this model from both the theoretical argument\nand the observational data. Including the spatial curvature, we will find that the closed\nuniverse is marginally favored. This result agrees to the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) Anisotropy experiments [22, 23, 24] and recent supernova investigations [25].\n\nII.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DARK ENERGY MODEL WITH CURVATURE\n\nWe start from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nspace-time metric\n\n\u0015\ndr 2\n2\n+ r d\u03a9 .\nds = \u2212c dt + a (t)\n1 \u2212 k r2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nIf a light is emitted from a point r1 at time t1 , it will arrive at the origin at time t0 .

To satisfy the second law of\n\n5\n\n\fthermodynamics, we require that\np\nL\u0307 = LH \u2212 c cosn[ |k| Reh (t)/a(t)]\ns\n!\n2\nd \u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03a9D )\nd\n= c \u221a\n\u2212 1\u2212\n\u03a9D [\u03b2(1 + z)2 + 1 + z \u2212 \u03b3]\n\u03a9D\n\u2265 0,\n\nThus\nd2 \u2265\n\n\u03a9D [\u03b2(1 + z)2 + 1 + z \u2212 \u03b3]\n\u03a9D\n=\n.\n2\n\u03b2(1 + z) + 1 + z \u2212 \u03b3\u03a9D\n1 + \u03a9k\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nFor the spatially flat universe, we recover d2 \u2265 \u03a9D . When the dark energy dominates,\nd2 \u2265 1, which is the lower bound of d proposed in [14].\n\nIn addition to the lower bound on d, employing the argument that the total energy in\na region of size L should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size, we have the\nupper bound d \u2264 1. Alternatively d \u2264 1 can be argued by using the condition Rs \u2264 L. For\na dark energy dominated universe, we have\n2GM\n= 2G\u03c1D\nRs =\nc2\nso\n\u03c1D \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0 3\nL\n3c2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2264 L,\n\n3c2\n.\n8\u03c0GL2\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nComparing Eqs.

It is also interesting to note that the Bekenstein entropy bound\nS\u2264\n\n2\u03c0EL\n8\u03c0 2 c\u03c1D L4\n\u03c0c3 L2\n=\n\u2264\n= SBH .\nc\n3\nG\n\n(19)\n\nTherefore, the maximum entropy is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH .\nApplying the constraint Eq.

Therefore, the\nholographic dark energy has no phantom-like behavior.\n\n6\n\n\fIII.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES\n\nNow we use the 157 gold sample SN Ia data compiled in [26] to fit the model. The\nparameters d, \u03a9m0 and \u03a9k0 in the model are determined by minimizing\n\u03c72 =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bc(zi )]2\n\u03c3i2\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the extinction-corrected distance modulus \u03bc(z) = 5 log10 (dL(z)/Mpc) + 25, the luminosity distance is\ndL = (1 + z)r(z)\np\nc(1 + z)\np\nsinn( |k|[(1 + z)Reh (z) \u2212 Reh (0)])\n=\nH0 |\u03a9k0 |\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ebs\n\uf8f6\n2\nd |\u03a9k0 | \uf8f8\nc(1 + z)\np\nsinn \uf8f0\u2212sinn\u22121 \uf8ed\n=\n\u03a9D0\nH0 |\u03a9k0 |\ns\n!#\n2 |\u03b3|(1 \u2212 \u03a9 )\nd\nD\n+sinn\u22121\n,\n\u03a9D [\u03b2(1 + z)2 + 1 + z \u2212 \u03b3]\n\n(21)\n\n\u03c3i is the total uncertainty in the observation. The nuisance parameter H0 is marginalized\nover with a flat prior assumption. Since H0 appears linearly as the form of 5 log10 H0\nin \u03c72 , the marginalization by integrating L = exp(\u2212\u03c72 /2) over all possible values of H0\n\nis equivalent to finding the value of H0 which minimizes \u03c72 if we also include the suitable\nintegration constant. Therefore we marginalize H0 by minimizing \u03c7\u20322 = \u03c72 (y)\u22122 ln(10) y/5\u2212\np\nP\n2 ln[ln(10) (2\u03c0/ i 1/\u03c3i2 )/5] over y, where y = 5 log10 H0 . We also assume a prior \u03a9m0 =\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1. The parameter space for \u03a9m0 is [0, 1], the parameter space for \u03a9k0 is [\u22121, 1] and\n\nthe parameter space for d is coming from the constraint Eq. (18). The best fit parameters\n+0.17\n2\nare \u03a9m0 = 0.35+0.11\n\u22120.10 , \u03a9k0 = 0.35\u22120.38 and d = 1.0\u22120.17 with \u03c7 = 173.35. Note that d has\n\nreached the upper bound 1, so there is no positive error for d. The error is referred to 1\u03c3 error\nthroughout this paper. For the flat universe, the best fit parameters are \u03a9m0 = 0.30+0.04\n\u22120.08\n2\nand d = 0.84+0.16\n\u22120.03 with \u03c7 = 176.33. For comparison, the best fit to the flat \u039bCDM model\n\ngives \u03c72 = 176.51. Therefore using the holographic dark energy model from the supernova\ndata fitting, the closed universe is marginally favored compared to the flat case.\nTo further constrain the model, we combine the SN Ia data with the WMAP data. The\nmain effect of changing the values of \u03a9m0 and \u03a9k0 on the CMB anisotropy can be found\nfrom the shift parameter R with which the l-space positions of the acoustic peaks in the\n7\n\n\fangular power spectrum shift [28],\nR =\n\np\n\n\u03a9m0 H0 r(zls )/c\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ebs\n2\n1\nd |\u03a9k0 | \uf8f8\n= p sinn \uf8f0\u2212sinn\u22121 \uf8ed\n\u03a9D0\n|\u03b3|\ns\n!#\n2 |\u03b3|(1 \u2212 \u03a9 )\nd\nD\n+sinn\u22121\n\u03a9D [\u03b2(1 + zls )2 + 1 + zls \u2212 \u03b3]\n= 1.710 \u00b1 0.137,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere zls = 1089 \u00b1 1 [27]. Therefore we use the above shift parameter along with the SN Ia\n\ndata to fit the model. The best fit parameters are \u03a9m0 = 0.29+0.06\n\u22120.08 , \u03a9k0 = 0.02 \u00b1 0.10 and\n\n2\nd = 0.84+0.16\n\u22120.03 with \u03c7 = 176.12. It is interesting to note that this best fitting result presents\n\nus the same curvature of the universe as that from the WMAP observation. This result\nsuggests that the WMAP data prefers an almost spatially flat universe while the SN Ia data\ngives a closed universe. By using the best fit parameters, we plot the evolutions of \u03a9D , \u03a9m\nand \u03a9k in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, we see that \u03a9D \u2192 1, \u03a9m \u2192 0 and \u03a9k \u2192 \u22121 + \u03a9D = 0.\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\u03a9D\n\u03a9m\n\u03a9k\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nRedshift z\n\nFIG. 1: The evolution of \u03a9D , \u03a9m and \u03a9k by using the best fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.29, \u03a9k0 = 0.02\nand d = 0.84.\n\nCombining Eqs.

By comparing to observations, we found that the holographic\nmodel is an effective model in describing dark energy. A spatially closed universe is favored\nby using the SN Ia data alone. Combining with the WMAP data, the best fitting result gives\nus a reasonable value of the curvature of our universe and the closed universe cannot be ruled\nout. Statistically the closed universe plays the same role as the flat universe in comparing\nwith observations. By investigating the evolution of the dark energy, we observed that the\ntransition of our universe from the deceleration to the acceleration happens at zt = 0.6. In\nRef. [15], one of us discussed the spatially flat holographic dark energy model and found\nthat \u03a9m0 = 0.46 and d = 0.20, the model behaved like phantom. In this paper, we used\nthe arguments of the second law of thermodynamics and the holographic principle to get\nthe lower and upper bounds on the parameter d. Due to the constraint Eq. (18), the\nholographic model discussed in this paper has no phantom-like behavior. Furthermore, we\n10\n\n\fget a lower value of \u03a9m0 which is more consistent with other observations on the value of\nthe non-relativistic matter energy density.\nComparing with Ref. [15], we have included the curvature of the universe in our discussion. The SN Ia data alone favors the closed universe with a bit bigger \u03a9k , while combining\nwith the WMAP data, \u03a9k decreases to a value around 0.02. This discussion is not trivial.\nAlthough our result is consistent with the viewpoint that our universe is approximately flat,\nthe small curvature of the universe is still interesting since it may contribute to the small l\nsuppress of the CMB spectrum [24].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was initiated in the workshop held in the SIAS-USTC.
