In first place this curved\nsurface, whose isometry group is SO(4), represents the position space in the celebrated Einstein's closed Universe\nand provides one of the major templates in gravitational studies. At the same time, it forms part of the compactified\nMinkowski spacetime as it emerges upon conformal compactifications in supersymmetric field theories. Further\nimportant aspects of the S 3 ball concern its relevance in the effective description of many-body phenomena such\nas coherent states, fluid-dynamics, [1]-[3], polymer chains [4], Brownian motion [5], and quantum dots [6], all\nreasons which make studies of physics on S 3 relevant.\nThe free geodesic motion of a scalar particle on S 3 is described by means of the eigenvalue problem of the\nsquared four-dimensional angular momentum, K, one of the Casimir invariants of the so(4) isometry algebra. We\nhere focus on a perturbance of this motion by a cot \u03c7 function of the second polar angle, \u03c7, parametrizing S 3 ,\nwhich is interesting in so far as it conserves the SO(4) degeneracy patterns in the spectrum of the free geodesic\nmotion, despite its non-commutativity with K. This property of the cotangent function is quite remarkable indeed\nand valid not only on S 3 but also on S 2 , and in any higher dimensions. To be specific, also on S 2 the cotangent potential does not remove the (2l + 1)-fold degeneracy in the spectrum of the free spherical rigid rotator,\ndespite its non-commutativity with L2 [7], [8]. For the explanation of the above degeneracy phenomena, Higgs\nand Leemon designed in [7], [9] algebras composed by the components of the angular momentum operators, Li ,\nin the respective external spaces under consideration, and a related Runge-Lenz vector, Rj , designed in analogy\nto the flat-space one, as known from the H atom problem. This strategy has been successful in explaining the\ndegeneracy phenomena under discussion, despite that Lj and Ri cease to close the respective so(3)/so(4) algebras.\nInstead, they close algebras which appear as deformations of the respective isometry algebras by terms cubic in\nthe momenta (see also [10] for further details).\n\n1\n\n\fWe here instead construct a closed so(4) algebra for the cotangent perturbed motion on S 3 , which we obtain as a\nnon-unitary similarity transformation of the geometric so(4) algebra of the free geodesic motion. Such becomes\npossible at the level of the (K \u2212 2b cot \u03c7) and K eigenvalue problems. We build up a matrix similarity transformation which connects the K and (K \u2212 2b cot \u03c7) carrier spaces, and which happens to be of the dilation (scaling)\ntype. The possibility for constructing such a transformation on S 2 has been indicated in work prior to this [8] and\nwill not be considered here.\nWe entirely focus on the so(4) case which is special by the fact that on S 3 the cotangent function solves the\nhomogeneous Laplace-Beltrami equation, and is a so called harmonic function there. As such, it can be treated\nalong the line of potential theory and the resulting electrodynamics would be Maxwellian, something which does\nnot occur in any other dimension.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In the next section we present the solutions of the cotangent-perturbed geodesic\nmotion on S 3 in terms of real Romanovski polynomials (reviewed in [11]) and decompose these solutions in the\nbasis of exponentially damped hyper-spherical harmonics. From there we deduce the non-unitary transformation\nwhich takes the so(4) isometry algebra to a realization that now describes the cotangent-hindered motion. Working\nat the level of the eigenvalue problems brings as an advantage simplifications by virtue of certain type of recurrence\nrelations among Gegenbauer polynomials. The paper closes with concise conclusions.\n\n2 Particle motion on the S 3 ball\n2.1 The free geodesic motion\nIn polar coordinates, the three-sphere S 3 is parametrized by the azimuthal angle \u03c6, and the two polar angles \u03b8, and\n\u03c7, according to,\nq\nS3 :\nx24 + x21 + x22 + x23 = R2 , x4 = R cos \u03c7, r \u2261 x21 + x22 + x23 = R sin \u03c7,\nx3 = r cos \u03b8,\n\nx1 = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nx2 = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R will be treated as a constant and will be set equal to one for simplicity. The Casimir operator, K, of the\nso(4) algebra is associated with the squared four-dimensional angular momentum, and is given by [12],\nK\n\n=\n\nL2 + N2 ,\n\nN2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nLi = i\u01ebijk xj\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202xk\n\nNj = \u2212ixj\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ ix4\n,\n\u2202x4\n\u2202xj\n\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\nsin \u03c7\n+ cot2 \u03c7 L2 ,\nsin \u03c7 \u2202\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the components Li , and Nj of the respective angular momentum, L, and the Euclidean boost operator, N,\nhave the property to close the so(4) algebra. The quantum-mechanical K eigenvalue problem is well known and\ngiven by,\n~2\nK YKlm (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6)\n2M\nYKlm (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n=\n=\n\ni\n~2 h\n2\n(K + 1) \u2212 1 YKlm (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6),\n2M\nl+1\nsinl \u03c7GK\u2212l\n(cos \u03c7)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the constant K determines the value of the four-dimensional angular momentum in the (K+1)2 -dimensional\nl+1\nrepresentation space of the hyper-spherical harmonics, YKlm (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6), Gn=K\u2212l\n(cos \u03c7) denote the Gegenbauer\nm\npolynomials, and Yl (\u03b8, \u03c6) are the standard three-dimensional spherical harmonics. We have chosen to work in\ndimensionless units, setting ~ = 1, and 2M = 1, with M standing for the mass of the particle under consideration.\nIt is obvious that the spectrum of the free geodesic motion on S 3 in (4) is characterized by a (K + 1)2 -fold\ndegeneracy of the states, as it should be given the fact that SO(4) is the isometry group of the three-ball. The\n2\n\n\fimmediate conspicuous analogy that comes to ones mind is that modulo the level spacings, the degeneracy patterns\nof the free geodesic motion on S 3 are same as those appearing in the inverse distance potential problem which\nshapes the H atom spectrum. Yet, the reasons for the two phenomena are to some extent different, indeed. The\ncommon denominator of both degeneracy patterns is an underlying so(4) symmetry algebra of the associated\nHamiltonians. The difference lies in the qualitatively distinct realizations of this very algebra in the respective\ncases. While the so(4) algebra of the free geodesic motion on S 3 is purely geometric in the sense that its elements,\nLi , and Nj in (3) exclusively depend on the position on the curved surface under consideration, the so(4) algebra\nin the inverse distance potential problem is dynamical as its elements need to be defined over the full phase space.\nIndeed, the so(4) algebra of the Coulomb potential contains besides the components L1 , L2 , and L3 , of ordinary\nangular momentum, the three components of the Runge-Lenz vector, R1 , R2 , and R3 [12]. Below, this concept\nwill acquire special importance in the investigation of the perturbed problem.\nCombining eqs.

The transformation is non-unitary and of the\ndilation type. As long as the similarity transformation of the Casimir invariant of the geometric algebra can be\nviewed as the result of subjecting the so(4) elements Li , and Nj in (7) to same transformation, we here have\ndesigned a representation of the geometric so(4) algebra for a \"curved\" Coulomb potential on S 3 .\n\nFigure 4:\nDeformation of the spherical metric, |Y000 (\u03c7, 0 \u03c6)|, (left) versus the exponentially scaled one,\n|Ye000 (\u03c7, 0, \u03c6)| (right) for b=1.\n\n3 Conclusions\nThe clue of the present study is that modulo a shift by a constant, a non-unitary scaling similarity transformation\nconverts the Casimir invariant of the so(4) isometry algebra of the three\u2013ball S 3 into the Coulomb potential problem\n9\n\n\fthere. The transformation, presented in (35), was concluded from decomposing the eigenfunctions of the \"curved\"\nCoulomb potential problem in the bases of exponentially scaled (damped) hyper-spherical harmonics in (20)\u2013(23).\nIt was furthermore shown to emerge by virtue of specific recurrence relations (30) among Gegenbauer polynomials.\nThe particle motion on S 3 considered here had the peculiarity that the perturbance left the degeneracy patterns\ncharacterizing the free motion intact, though the isometry group symmetry has been broken. The breaking of the\ninitial SO(4) rotational invariance by the \"curved\" Coulomb potential happened at the level of the representation\nfunctions, thus avoiding the more severe breakdown at the level of the algebra through deformations [7], [9], [10],\n[18]. This subtle type of symmetry breaking is visualized in Fig. 4 by the deformation of the metric of the S 3\nsphere through the damping exponential factor under consideration. It might be interesting to notice, that such a\nmetric deformation emerges also in effect of a conformal symmetry breaking by the dilaton mass [19]. The method\nproposed can easily be extended towards hyperbolic spaces through complexification of the polar angle \u03c7 in (2) as\n\u03c7 \u2192 i\u03c7. Simultaneously changing b \u2192 \u2212ib in (10) takes one to the Coulomb problem on a hyperboloid. Quantum\nproblems on hyperbolic spaces, pioneered by Dirac [20] through his consideration of the electron wave equation\nin the De-Sitter universe, acquire importance as well within the context of pure relativistic descriptions of bound\nsystems, as within the context of gravitational studies.\n\n4 Acknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Jose Antonio Vallejo for an illuminating discussion on the relationship between groups and algebras.\nWork partly supported by CONACyT-M\u00e9xico under grant number CB-2006-01/61286.\n\nReferences\n[1] Jean-Claude Gay, Dominique Delande, and Antoine Bommier, Atomic quantum states with maximal localization on classical elliptical orbits, Phys.
