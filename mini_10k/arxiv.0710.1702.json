They can exhibit various topological excitations,\nsuch as vortices and solitons. The dynamics of solitons in elongated BECs [5] is the\natom-optics version of the nonlinear propagation of light pulses in optical fibres [4]. The\n1\n\n\fBEC offers a remarkable freedom in terms of controlling the physical parameters such as\ndimensionality and even the sign of the strength of the atom-atom interaction [5].\nSolitons in BECs can be of both dark and bright type. Dark solitons are formed in\nBECs with repulsive interaction between the atoms [5]. For completely dark solitons the\ncondensate wavefunction is zero at the centre and changes its sign then crossing the central\npoint, i.e. the condensate wave-function has an infinitely steep \u03c0 phase slip at the centre [5].\nOn the other hand, the bright solitons are formed in BECs with repulsive interaction between the atoms. The wave-function of the BEC is then localised at the centre [5] and\ngoes to zero further away from this point. The dark solitons which manifests themselves as\na density minimum moving with a constant speed against a uniform background density,\nas well as bright solitons which are shape preserving wave packets, have both been experimentally realised [6\u20139]. The dynamics of solitons in BECs has been extensively studied.\nThis has included investigations of the stability properties [10], as well as soliton dynamics\nin inhomogeneous clouds [11], in multicomponent BECs [12,13] and in supersonic flow [14].\nSolitons can be created in various ways with a variable degree of controllability, e.g., by\ncolliding clouds of BEC [15\u201317] or engineering the density [18, 19].\nTraditionally dark solitons in BECs are created using phase imprinting [6, 7, 20\u201322],\nwhere a part of the condensate cloud is illuminated by a far detuned laser pulse in order to induce a sharp \u03c0 phase slip in the wave function. The subsequent dynamics can\nindeed develop solitons [6, 7]. There are, however, some rather severe drawbacks with\nsuch a method of phase engineering. The resolution of the required phase slip is naturally\nrestricted by the diffraction limit, i.e. the width of the phase slip should be larger than\nan optical wave-length. Furthermore the phase imprinting does not produce a density\nminimum characteristic to the dark solitons in the region of the phase change. Hence\ncompletely dark stationary solitons are difficult to achieve, which consequently results in\nso called grey moving solitons with a shallow density dip.\nIt is of a significant interest to be able to create slowly moving, or even completely\nstationary solitons in order to test for instance their scattering properties. The shapes of\nthe colliding solitons are to be preserved. In addition, a relative spatial shift is expected.\nThis spatial shift, however, can only be detected for extremely slow solitons due to the\ninherent logarithmic dependence of the spatial shift on the relative velocity between the\nsolitons [23, 24]. The standard phase imprinting also inevitably creates phonons in the\ntrapped cloud because the constructed initial state is not the exact soliton solution largely\ndue to the missing density notch [6, 7].\nIn this paper we show how states which have the required phase slip and density profile\nfor solitons can be created by sweeping three laser beams through an elongated BEC as\nshown in Fig. 1. If one of the beams is in the first order (TEM10) Hermite-Gaussian\nmode, its amplitude has a transversal \u03c0 phase slip which will be transferred to atoms thus\nproducing a soliton. More importantly, with a sequence of three laser beams it is possible\nto circumvent the restriction set by the diffraction limit. The laser fields reshape an atomic\nwave-function so that it acquires a zero-point. This leads to a hole in the atomic density,\nthe width of which is only limited by the intensity ratios between the incident laser beams\ndue to the geometric nature [25] of the process. The formation of the hole is accompanied\n2\n\n\fD\n\nE\n\n\"%#\n\n|0i\n\n\u03a91\n\n|1i\n\n\u03a92\n|2i\n\n\u03a93\n|3i\n\n6ZHHSLQJ GLUHFWLRQ\n\n[\n\n\u03a93\n\n\u03a92\n\u03a91\n\u03a91\n\u03a92\n\n]\n\nFigure 1: a) The level scheme for the three laser beams \u03a9i (i = 1, 2, 3). b) The sequence\nof laser beams being swept through the BEC involves a preparation stage \u03a92 \u2192 \u03a91 and\na final stage \u03a91 \u2192 \u03a92 which engineers the phase and density of the BEC to produce a\nsoliton.\nby a step-like (infinitely sharp) \u03c0 phase slip in the atomic wave-function when crossing\nthe zero-point. The method is particularly useful for creating multicomponent (vector)\nsolitons of the dark-bright form as well as the dark-dark combination. In addition it is\npossible to create in a controllable way two or more slowly moving dark solitons close to\neach other for studying their collisional properties.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFormulation\nOutline of the proposed setup\n\nConsider a cigar-shape atomic BEC elongated in the z-direction. To create solitons in the\nBEC, we propose to sweep three incident laser beams across the condensate. The laser\nbeams interact with the condensate atoms in a tripod configuration [25, 26], i.e. the atoms\nare characterized by three ground states |1i, |2i, |3i and an excited state |0i. The j-th\nlaser drives resonantly the atomic transition between the ground state |ji and the excited\nstate |0i, see Fig. 1a. Initially the atoms forming the BEC are prepared in the hyperfine\nground state |1i. Subsequently the lasers are swept through the BEC in the x-direction,\ni.e. perpendicular to the longitudinal axis z of the condensate.\nThe sweeping process is made of two stages depicted in Fig. 1b. In the first stage the\n3\n\n\flasers 1 and 2 are applied in a counter-intuitive sequence to transfer adiabatically the atoms\nfrom the ground state |1i to another ground state |2i. If an additional laser 3 is on during\nthe first stage, a partial transfer of atoms from the ground states |1i to |2i is possible [26].\nIn that case a coherent superposition of states |1i and |2i is created after completing the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, the lasers 1, 2 and 3 are applied once again to transfer\natoms from the state |2i back to the state |1i and from the state |1i to the state |2i. If\nthe amplitude of one of these lasers \u03a91 or \u03a92 changes the sign at z = z0 , the BEC picks up\na \u03c0 phase shift at this point after the sweeping, and a soliton can be formed. This is the\ncase e.g. if one of the beams is the first order Hermite-Gaussian beam centered at z = 0.\nIt is important to realize that at least two laser fields are needed to complete the\nadiabatic transfer of population between the ground states. Therefore the adiabaticity can\nbe violated in the vicinity of the point z = z0 where one of the Rabi frequencies \u03a91 or \u03a92\ngoes to zero. Inclusion of the third (support) laser 3 helps to avoid such a violation of the\nadiabaticity. In fact the atoms would experience absorption in the vicinity of z = z0 if the\nsupport laser 3 was missing during the second stage.\nIt should be mentioned that there are similar previous proposals for creating vortices in\na BEC via the two-laser Raman processes involving the transfer of an optical vortex to the\natoms [27\u201329]. In these schemes the lasers are far detuned from the single-photon resonance\nto avoid the absorption at the vortex core. In our scheme the lasers are in an exact singlephoton resonance, so the use of the third (support) laser is essential to avoid the losses.\nAn advantage of the resonant scheme is that an efficient and complete population transfer\nis possible between the hyperfine ground states, whereas in the non-resonant case only a\nfraction of population can be transferred [29].\n\n2.2\n\nHamiltonian for a tripod atom\n\nLet us now provide a quantitative description of our scheme. The j-th laser beam is\ncharacterised by the complex Rabi frequency \u03a9\u0303j = \u03a9j exp(ikj * r + iSj ) , with j = 1, 2, 3,\nwhere \u03a9j is the real amplitude, the phase being comprised of the local phase kj *r as well as\nthe global (distance-independent) phase Sj . In what follows, the Rabi frequencies \u03a92 and\n\u03a93 are considered to be positive: \u03a92 > 0, \u03a93 > 0. Yet, the Rabi frequency \u03a91 is allowed\nto be negative. This makes it possible to include an additional \u03c0 phase shift in the spatial\nprofile of the first beam when crossing the zero-point at z = z0 .\nThe electronic Hamiltonian of a tripod atom reads in the interaction representation:\n\u0124e = \u2212h\u0304(\u03a9\u03031 |0ih1| + \u03a9\u03032 |0ih2| + \u03a9\u03033 |0ih3|) + H.c.\n\n(1)\n\nThe tripod atoms have two degenerate dark states |D1 i and |D2 i of zero eigen-energy\n(\u0124e |Dn i = 0) containing no excited-state contribution [25, 26],\n1\n(|1i\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6|2i\u2032)\n2\n1+\u03b6\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n,\n\u03be\n(\u03b6|1i\n+\n|2i\n)\n\u2212\n\u03be\n(1\n+\n\u03b6\n)|3i\n|D2 i = \u221a\n3\n2\n1 + \u03b62\n\n|D1 i = \u221a\n\n4\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\fwhere |ji\u2032 = |ji exp(i(k3 \u2212 kj ) * r + i(S3 \u2212 Sj )) (with j = 1, 2, 3) are the modified atomic\nstate-vectors accommodating the phases of the incident laser fields, \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92 is the ratio\nbetween the Rabi frequencies of the first and second fields, and \u03bej are the normalised Rabi\nfrequencies (j = 1, 2, 3),\n\u03bej =\n\n\u03a9j\n,\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9=\n\nq\n\n\u03a921 + \u03a922 + \u03a923\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03be3 > 0 and \u2212\u221e < \u03b6 < +\u221e. The atomic dark states |D1 i and |D2 i depend on the\ncentre of mass coordinate r through the spatial dependence of the Rabi frequencies \u03a9j and\nstate-vectors |ji\u2032 .\n\n2.3\n\nGeneral equations of motion\n\nThe full atomic state-vector of a multicomponent BEC is |\u03a6(r, t)i = 4j=1 |ji\u03a8j (r, t), where\nthe constituent wave functions \u03a8j (r, t) describe the translational motion of the BEC in the\ninternal state |ji of the tripod scheme. The wave functions \u03a8j (r, t) obey a multicomponent\nGross-Pitaevski equation of the form\nP\n\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n1 2\n|\u03a6(r, t)i =\n\u2207 + \u0124e + V\u0302 |\u03a6(r, t)i,\n\u2202t\n2M\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0124e from Eq. (1) describes the light-induced transitions between the different internal\nstates of atoms. The diagonal operator\nV\u0302 =\n\n3\nX\n\n(Vj + gjl |\u03a8l |2 )|jihj| .\n\n(6)\n\nl>j=0\n\naccommodates the trapping potential Vj (r) for the j-th internal state, as well as the nonlinear interaction between the components j and l characterised by the strength gjl =\n4\u03c0h\u03042 ajl /m, with ajl being the corresponding scattering length.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTime-evolution of the atom-light system\nAdiabatic approximation for the dark states\n\nWe shall apply the adiabatic approximation [25, 30, 31] under which atoms evolve within\ntheir dark-state manifold during the sweeping. This is legitimate if the total Rabi fre\u22121\nquency \u03a9 is sufficiently large compared to the inverse sweeping duration \u03c4sweep\n. The full\nP2\n(D)\natomic state-vector can then be expanded as: |\u03a6(r, t)i = n=1 \u03a8n (r, t)|Dn (r, t)i, where a\ncomposite wavefunction \u03a8(D)\nn (r) describes the translational motion of an atom in the dark\nstate |Dn (r, t)i. The atomic centre of mass motion is thus represented by a two-component\nwave-function\n!\n(D)\n\u03a81\n.\n(7)\n\u03a8=\n(D)\n\u03a82\n5\n\n\fobeying the following equation of motion [25]:\n1\n\u2202\n(\u2212ih\u0304\u2207 \u2212 A)2 + V (r) + \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03a8 ,\nih\u0304 \u03a8 =\n\u2202t\n2M\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the effective vector potential A and the matrix \u03b2 are the 2\u00d72 matrices appearing due\nto the spatial and temporal dependence of the dark states: An,m = ih\u0304hDn (r, t)|\u2207Dm (r, t)i\nand \u03b2n,m = ih\u0304hDn (r, t)|\u2202/\u2202tDm (r, t)i. The former A is known as the Mead-Berry connection [32, 33], whereas the latter matrix \u03b2 is responsible for the geometric phase [34].\nThe 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u03c6 is the effective trapping potential (explicitly presented in Ref. [25])\nappearing due to the spatial dependence of the dark states. Assuming that all three beams\nco-propagate (k1 \u2248 k2 \u2248 k3 ), the effective vector potential [25] reduces to\n\u03be3\nA = h\u0304\n\u2207\u03b6\n1 + \u03b62\n\n0 i\n\u2212i 0\n\n!\n\n(9)\n\nLastly, the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix V originating from the operator V\u0302 , Eq. (6), accommodates the\ntrapping potential for the dark states [25] as well as the atom-atom coupling.\n\n3.2\n\nTime-evolution during the sweeping\n\nSuppose the incident laser beams are swept through a trapped BEC along the x axis with\na velocity v, as shown in Fig. 1b. This can be done either by shifting in the transversal\n(x) direction the laser beams propagating along the y axis or by applying a set of laser\npulses of the appropriate shape and sequence propagating in the x direction. In the latter\ncase, the sweeping velocity v will coincide with the speed of light. In both cases the\nadiabatic dark states depend on time in the following way: |Dn (r, t)i \u2261 |Dn (r\u2032 )i, where\nr\u2032 = (x\u2032 , y, z) \u2261 (x \u2212 vt, y, z) is the atomic coordinate in the frame of the moving laser\nfields. Let us assume that the time, \u03c4sweep = d/v, it takes to sweep the laser beams through\na BEC of the width d, is small compared to the time associated with the BEC chemical\npotential \u03c4\u03bc = h\u0304/\u03bc which is typically of the order of 10\u22125 s. In that case one can neglect\nthe dynamics of the atomic centre of mass during the sweeping. Consequently the time\nevolution of the multicomponent wave-function during the sweeping is governed by the\nmatrix-term \u03b2 = \u2212vAx featured in Eq. (8), giving\nih\u0304\u2202t \u03a8 = vAx \u03a8 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the Ax the effective vector potential along the sweeping direction.\nIn passing we note that the subsequent time evolution of the BEC after the two-stage\nsweeping will be described by the general Gross-Pitaevski equation (5) with the light fields\noff (\u0124e = 0), as we shall do in Section 4.\nReturning to Eq. (10), since vAx commutes with itself at different times, one can relate\nthe wave-function \u03a8(t) at a final time t = tf to the one at the initial time t = ti as\n\u03a8(r, tf ) = exp (\u2212i\u0398) \u03a8(r, ti ) ,\n6\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhere the exponent \u0398 is a 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrix\n1\n\u0398=\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\nti\n\n1\nAx (r \u2212 vt)vdt =\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\nxi\n\nxf\n\nAx (r\u2032 )dx\u2032 .\n\n(12)\n\nand the integration is over the sweeping path r\u2032 = (x \u2212 vt, y, z) from xf = x \u2212 vtf to\nxi = x \u2212 vti . In most cases of interest the initial and final times can be considered to be\nsufficiently remote, so that the spatial integration can be from xf = \u2212\u221e to xi = +\u221e.\n3.2.1\n\nThe first stage\n\nLet us now analyze the proposed two-stage setup in more details. In the first stage both\nRabi frequencies \u03a91 and \u03a92 are positive. The lasers 1 and 2 are applied in a counterintuitive\norder (see Fig. 1b), where the ratio \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92 changes from \u03b6(t\u2032i ) = 0 to \u03b6(t\u2032f ) = +\u221e.\nOn the other hand, the laser 3 is dominant for both the initial and final times where\n\u03be3 = \u03a93 /\u03a9 = 1. Initially the BEC has the wave-function \u03a8(r) and is in the internal\natomic ground state |1i which coincides with the first dark state at the initial time t\u2032i , i.e.\n|D1 (r, t\u2032i )i = |1i. The full initial atomic state-vector is therefore |\u03a6(r, t\u2032i )i = \u03a8(r)|D1(r, t\u2032i )i.\nThis provides the following initial condition for the multicomponent wave-function:\n\u03a8(r, t\u2032i )\n\n\u03a8(r)\n0\n\n=\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nEquations (9) and (11)\u2013(13) yield the multicomponent wave-function after the first stage\n\u03a8(r, t\u2032f )\nwhere\n\n= \u03a8(r)\n\ncos \u03b2\n\u2212 sin \u03b2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\n\u2202 arctan \u03b6 \u2032\ndx\n(15)\n\u2202x\u2032\n\u2212\u221e\nis the mixing angle between the dark states acquired in the first stage.\nSuppose we have the following laser beams. The second beam \u03a92 is the Gaussian beam\ncharacterised by a waist \u03c3z in the z direction. The beam is centered at x\u2032 = x\u0304 + \u2206 in the\nsweeping direction and at z = 0 in the z direction,\n\u03b2=\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u03a92 = Ae\u2212z\n\n\u03be3\n\n2 /\u03c3 2 \u2212(x\u2032 \u2212x\u0304\u2212\u2206)2 /\u03c3 2\nz\nx\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nThe first beam \u03a91 is characterised by the same amplitude A, the same waist \u03c3z and the\nsame width \u03c3x . Yet it is centered at x\u2032 = x\u0304 \u2212 \u2206 in the sweeping direction, where 2\u2206\nis the separation between the two beams. The beam waists should be of the order of the\ncondensate length (or larger) in the z-direction, so that the whole condensate is illuminated\nby the beams.\nThe third beam is considered to change little along the sweeping direction x. Furthermore it has the same width \u03c3z in the z-direction as the first two beams\n\u03a93 = A\u03bae\u2212z\n7\n\n2 /\u03c3 2\nz\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\n\f2\n1.8\n1.6\n\n\u03b2 / (\u03c0/4)\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03ba\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 2: Dependence of the mixing angle \u03b2 on the relative amplitude of the third beam \u03ba.\nThe spatial separation between the first and the second beams is taken to be 2\u2206 = 1.2\u03c3x\nwhere \u03c3x is the width of the beams in the sweeping direction.\nThe first stage is aimed at creating a superposition of states |1i and |2i. Since we take\nall the beams to be the Gaussian beams characterized by the same widths \u03c3z , the Rabi\nfrequency ratios \u03a92 /\u03a91 and \u03a93 /\u03a91 have no z-dependence. As a result the acquired mixing\nangle \u03b2 has no z-dependence, i.e. it is uniform along the BEC. The magnitude of \u03b2 depends\non the relative intensity of the third laser. If the third laser is weak (\u03be3 = \u03a93 /\u03a9 \u2192 0 at the\ncrossing point where \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92 = 1), the mixing between the states |1i and |2i is small:\n\u03b2 \u226a 1. On the other hand, if the Rabi frequency \u03a93 is comparable with \u03a91 and \u03a92 at the\ncrossing point where \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92 = 1, the mixing can be close to its maximum: \u03b2 \u2248 \u03c0/4.\nIn this way, one can control the mixing angle by changing the intensity of the third beam,\nas one can see from Fig. 2.\n3.2.2\n\nThe second stage\n\nIn the second stage the Rabi frequency \u03a91 can be both positive and negative depending on\nthe transversal coordinate z. The laser 1 is now applied first, so that the ratio \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92\nchanges from \u03b6(ti ) = \u00b1\u221e to \u03b6(tf ) = 0 in the second stage. Again the third laser dominates\nfor the initial and final times: \u03a93 /\u03a9 = 1. The second stage takes place immediately after\ncompleting the first stage, so the multicomponent wave-function of the first stage (14)\nserves as an initial condition for the second stage.\nEquations (11), (12) and (14) together with (2) and (3) yield the total state vector after\nthe second stage:\n\u0010\n\n|\u03a6(r, tf )i = |1i\u03a8(r) sin \u03b3 cos \u03b2 \u2212 ei\u03bd12 cos \u03b3 sin \u03b2\n8\n\n\u0011\n\n\f\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212|2i\u03a8(r) cos \u03b3 cos \u03b2 + ei\u03bd12 sin \u03b3 sin \u03b2 .\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03bd12 = S1 \u2212 S2 + S2\u2032 \u2212 S1\u2032 is the phase mismatch between the Rabi frequencies \u03a91 and\n\u03a92 in the first and second stages. The resulting mixing angle acquired in the second stage\nis\nZ +\u221e\n\u2202 arctan \u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3z =\ndx .\n(19)\n(1 \u2212 \u03be3 )\n\u2202x\u2032\n\u2212\u221e\nIf the first and second lasers are weak (\u03a93 /\u03a9 \u2192 1 at the crossing point where \u03b6 = \u03a91 /\u03a92 =\n1), the mixing angle is small \u03b3z \u226a 1. On the other hand, if first and second lasers are\nstrong at this point, we have \u03b3z \u2192 \u2213\u03c0/2. The change in sign of \u03b3z will introduce a phase\nshift which is needed to create solitons.\nIn the second stage the first beam \u03a91 is a first-order (in the z direction) Hermite \u0303\nGaussian beam centered at z = 0 and x\u2032 = x\u0303 + \u2206\nz\n2\n2\n\u2032\n \u0303 2 2\n\u03a91 = A e\u2212z /\u03c3z \u2212(x \u2212x\u0303\u2212\u2206) /\u03c3x ,\nB\n\n(20)\n\nwhere z = \u00b1B represents a distance where \u03a91 = \u00b1\u03a92 for x\u2032 = x\u0303. In most cases of interest\nthe distance B is much smaller than the waist of the beams: B \u226a \u03c3z . The second beam\n \u0303 in the\n\u03a92 is the ordinary Gaussian beam centered at z = 0 along the BEC and x\u2032 = x\u0303 \u2212 \u2206\nsweeping direction\n2\n2\n\u2032\n \u0303 2 2\n\u03a92 = Ae\u2212z /\u03c3z \u2212(x \u2212x\u0303+\u2206) /\u03c3x ,\n(21)\n \u0303 is the separation between the two beams. The ratio between the Rabi frequencies\nwhere 2\u2206\nreads then\nz  \u0303 \u2032\n\u03a91\n2\n= e4\u2206(x \u2212x\u0303)/\u03c3x ,\n(22)\n\u03b6=\n\u03a92\nB\nEquation (22) provides the following limiting cases:\n\u03b6 \u2261 \u03b6(z, x\u2032 ) =\n\n(\n\n0, for x\u2032 \u2192 +\u221e ,\n\u00b1\u221e, for x\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u221e .\n\n(23)\n\nFinally let us determine the crossing point where \u03a91 = \u03a92 . Using Eq. (22), the condition\n|\u03b6| = 1 yields the crossing point x\u2032 = x\u2032cr for a fixed z coordinate:\nx\u2032cr = x\u0303 +\n\n\u03c32\nz\nln .\n \u0303\nB\n4\u2206\n\n(24)\n\nSpecifically, if z = B, the crossing point is: x\u2032cr = x\u0303. Since B \u226a \u03c3, the Rabi frequencies at\nz = B and x\u2032 = x\u0303 are:\n \u03032 2\n\u03a91 = \u03a92 \u2248 Ae\u2212\u2206 /\u03c3x .\n(25)\nIn the next subsection we shall analyse in more detail the multicomponent wave-function\nafter completing the second stage.\n\n9\n\n\f1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\u03a8\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n-0.5\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\nz\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 3: Multicomponent wave-function after completing the second stage in the case\nwhere the second component is populated after the first stage (\u03b2 = 0) and there is no\nphase mismatch between the lasers of the first and second stages (\u03bd12 = 0). The second\nand third laser beams are taken to be the Gaussian beams with equal widths \u03c3z . The first\nlaser beam is the first order Hermite-Gaussian beam with same width \u03c3z . The parameters\n \u0303 x = 1.2, B/\u03c3z = 0.1 and \u03ba = 0.1. The wave function of the first (second)\nused are 2\u2206/\u03c3\ncomponent is plotted in a solid (dashed) line.\n\n3.3\n\nMulticomponent wave-function alter the sweeping\n\nSuppose that there is no phase mismatch between the lasers of the first and second stages:\n\u03bd12 = 0. In that case Eq. (18) yields\n|\u03a6(r, tf )i = \u03a8(r)[\u2212 sin(\u03b3z \u2212 \u03b2)|1i + cos(\u03b3z \u2212 \u03b2)|2i] ,\n\n(26)\n\nIf \u03b2 = 0, the second component is populated after the first stage. After the whole sweeping\nthe state-vector then takes the form\n|\u03a6(r, tf )i = \u03a8(r)[\u2212 sin \u03b3z |1i + cos \u03b3z |2i] .\n\n(27)\n\nIn this case the first component alters the sign at z = z0 where the Rabi frequency \u03a91\nor \u03a92 (and hence \u03b3z ) crosses the zero-point. On the other hand, the second component\nis maximum at this point and symmetrically decays to zero away from this point. Such\na multicomponent wave-function has a shape close to that of a soliton of the dark-bright\nform (see Fig. 3). This will indeed lead to the formation of such a soliton, as we shall from\nthe analysis of the subsequent time-evolution presented in the next Section.\nOn the other hand, \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 corresponds to the case where both components are initially\n10\n\n\f0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n\u03a8\n\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n-0.5\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\nz\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 4: Multicomponent wave-function after completing the second stage in the case\nwhere where both components are initially populated after the first stage (\u03b2 = \u03c0/4) and\nthere is no phase mismatch between the lasers of the first and second stages (\u03bd12 = 0). The\nsecond and third laser beams are taken to be the Gaussian beams with equal widths \u03c3z .\nThe first laser beam is the first order Hermite-Gaussian beam with same width \u03c3z . The\n \u0303 x = 1.2, B/\u03c3z = 0.1 and \u03ba = 0.1. The wave function of the first\nparameters used are 2\u2206/\u03c3\n(second) component is plotted in a solid (dashed) line.\npopulated with equal probabilities. Thus we have after the sweeping:\n|\u03a6(r, tf )i = \u2212\u03a8(r)[\u2212 sin(\u03b3z \u2212 \u03c0/4)|1i + sin(\u03b3z + \u03c0/4)|2i] .\n\n(28)\n\nIn that case both components of the wave-function acquire a \u03c0 phase shift in a vicinity of\nz = z0 where \u03a91 = 0, as one can see clearly in the Fig. 4 Note that the zero-points of\neach component are slightly shifted with respect to each other. This makes it possible to\nproduce two component dark-dark solitons oscillating around each other, as we shall see\nin the following Section.\nIf \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 , yet there is a \u03c0/2 phase mismatch (\u03bd12 = \u03c0/2), Eq. (18) reduces to\n1\n|\u03a6(r, tf )i = \u2212\u03a8(r)ei\u03b3z \u221a [|2i \u2212 i|1i] .\n2\n\n(29)\n\nIn that case both components are characterised by the same spatial modulation exp (i\u03b3z )\nand have a relative phase \u03c0/2 after the sweeping. Therefore both components initially\nhave the same velocity distribution proportional to \u2207\u03b3z . Furthermore there is no hole in\nthe atomic density of neither component after the sweeping, similar the case in the phase\nimprinting techniques.\n11\n\n\fIn this way, the creation of solitons can be controlled by changing the mixing angle \u03b2\nand the phase mismatch \u03bd12\n\n4\n\nSubsequent dynamics and soliton formation\n\nThe optical preparation of the initial state of the two-component Bose-Einstein condensate\ndescribed in the previous section, is fast compared to any characteristic dynamics in the\nBose-Einstein condensate. This is the case if the time \u03c4sweep = d/v it takes to sweep the\nlaser beams through a BEC of the width d, is small compared to the time associated with\nthe BEC chemical potential \u03c4\u03bc = h\u0304/\u03bc which is typically of the order of 10\u22125 s. With the\nprepared initial state and for sufficiently low temperatures we can therefore describe the\nsubsequent dynamics using a two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation [12]\nh\u03042 2\n\u2202\n\u03a81 = [\u2212\n\u2207 + V (z) + g11 |\u03a81 |2 + g12 |\u03a82 |2 ]\u03a81\n\u2202t\n2m\nh\u03042 2\n\u2202\n\u2207 + V (z) + g22 |\u03a82 |2 + g12 |\u03a81 |2 ]\u03a82 .\nih\u0304 \u03a82 = [\u2212\n\u2202t\n2m\n\nih\u0304\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\nThe external potential is here chosen to be quadratic in the z-direction,\n1\nV (z) = m\u03c9 2 z 2 ,\n2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the trap frequency and m the atomic mass. The two-body interactions are\ndescribed by\n4\u03c0h\u03042 aij\ngij =\n, i, j = {1, 2}\n(33)\nmS\nwith the scattering lengths aij which represents the intra and inter collisional interactions\nbetween the atoms in the states 1 and 2. In Eq. (33) we have introduced the effective\ncross-section S of the elongated cloud. Strictly speaking the elongated Bose-Einstein condensate is three dimensional. If, however, the transversal trapping is sufficiently strong,\nthe dynamics can be considered effectively one dimensional, as in Eqs. (30) and (31). This\nrequires that the corresponding transversal ground state energy is much\nlarger than the\nR\nchemical potential of the condensate. We choose the normalisation as dz|\u03a8i (z)|2 = Ni ,\nwhere Ni is the particle number in condensate i (i = 1, 2).\nWith the initial states from the previous section we can simulate the dynamics of the\nBose-Einstein condensate. We consider a condensate with\nq g11 : g12 : g22 = 1.0 : 0.97 : 1.03\nh\u0304\nand time is in units of \u03c9 \u22121 .\nwhere g12 N1 = 286 and N1 = N2 . The unit of length is m\u03c9\nIn figure 5 we show the dark-bright soliton dynamics whose initial state is prepared by\nchoosing \u03b2 = 0 and \u03bd12 = 0. The two-component system which has one dark soliton in\ncomponent 1 and a bright soliton in component 2, is stable, i.e. the solitons are stationary.\nThis shows that the initial state is indeed close to the exact soliton solution. If the initial\nstate is prepared with \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 and \u03bd12 = 0, on the other hand, the dynamics is strikingly\n12\n\n\fFigure 5: The dark-bright soliton. The two figures show the one dimensional density as a\nfunction of time for component 1 and 2. The lighter (darker) colours correspond to higher\n(lower) atomic densities.\ndifferent, see figure 6. In this case we create two dark solitons with opposite phase gradients,\nhence there is an oscillatory motion, sometimes referred to as a soliton molecule. Such a\nbound state is only stable if the soliton velocities are low [12] which is indeed the case here.\nAlternatively, with \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 and \u03bd12 = \u03c0/2, the solitons move in unison as shown in figure\n7. The large oscillatory motion appearing in Fig. 7 stems from the fact that the condensate\ndensity is not homogeneous, hence the solitons experience an effective trap [11].\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have proposed a new method of creating solitons in elongated Bose-Einstein\nCondensates (BECs) by sweeping three laser beams through the BEC. If one of the beams\nis the first order (TEM10) Hermite-Gaussian mode, its amplitude has a transversal \u03c0 phase\nslip which will be transferred to the atoms thus creating a soliton. Using this method it is\npossible to circumvent the restriction set by the diffraction limit. The method allows one\nto create multicomponent (vector) solitons of the dark-bright form as well as the dark-dark\ncombination. In addition it is possible to create in a controllable way two or more slowly\nmoving dark solitons close to each other for studying the collisional properties. For this\nthe first beam \u03a91 should represent a superposition of the zero and second order HermiteGaussian modes in the second stage. The soliton collisions will be considered in more\ndetails elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation through the institutional collaborative grant between the University of Kaiserslautern and the Institute of\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 6: The bound state dark-dark soliton.
