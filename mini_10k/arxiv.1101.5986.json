First, one derives an operator product expansion (OPE) for the correlation\nfunction\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n(1.1)\n\u03a0(p ) = i d4 x eipx h0|T j5 (x)j5\u2020 (0) |0i\nof two pseudoscalar heavy-light currents\nj5 (x) = (mQ + m)q\u0304(x)i\u03b35 Q(x).\n\n(1.2)\n\nSecond, one considers the sum rule for this correlator. The sum rule is nothing but the expression of the fact that the\nrepresentation of the Borelized correlator (1.1), \u03a0(p2 ) \u2192 \u03a0(\u03c4 ), in the language of the intermediate hadron states is\nequal to the OPE for this correlator:\n\u03a0(\u03c4 ) =\n\n2\n2\n4 \u2212MQ\n\u03c4\nfQ\nMQ\ne\n\n+\n\nZ\u221e\n\nds e\n\n\u2212s\u03c4\n\nsphys\n\n\u03c1hadr (s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n(mQ\n\nds e\u2212s\u03c4 \u03c1pert (s, \u03bc) + \u03a0power (\u03c4, \u03bc).\n\n(1.3)\n\n+m)2\n\nHere, MQ denotes the mass of the pseudoscalar meson PQ containing the heavy quark Q while fQ is its decay constant:\n2\n(mQ + m)h0|q\u0304i\u03b35 Q|PQ i = fQ MQ\n.\n\n(1.4)\n\nFor the correlator (1.1), sphys = (MVQ + M\u03c0 )2 is the physical continuum threshold, MVQ being the mass of the vector\nmeson containing Q. Obviously, for large values of \u03c4 the contribution of the excited states decreases faster than the\nground-state contribution and therefore \u03a0(\u03c4 ) is dominated by the ground state.\nThe perturbative spectral density is obtained in the form of an expansion in terms of the strong coupling \u03b1s (\u03bc):\n\u03c1pert (s, \u03bc) = \u03c1(0) (s) +\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc) (1)\n\u03c1 (s) +\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc)\n\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03c1(2) (s) + * * * .\n\n(1.5)\n\nClearly, the correlator (1.1) does not depend on the renormalization scale \u03bc; however, both the perturbative expansion\ntruncated at fixed order in \u03b1s and the truncated power corrections \u03a0power (\u03c4, \u03bc) given in terms of the condensates and\nthe radiative corrections to the latter depend on \u03bc. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of the lowest-order contributions\nstrongly depend on the choice of the renormalization scheme/scale.\n\n\f2\nUnfortunately, the truncated OPE allows one to calculate the correlator only at not sufficiently large \u03c4 , such that\nthe excited states give a sizable contribution to \u03a0(\u03c4 ) in the corresponding \u03c4 -range. In principle, the physical spectral\ndensity above the threshold might be measured experimentally; in practice, however, it is unknown. Therefore, one\nadopts the concept of duality to relate the contribution of the excited hadron states to the perturbative contribution:\nperturbative QCD spectral density \u03c1pert (s) and hadron spectral density \u03c1hadr (s) are close to each other at large values\nof s; thus, for sufficiently large values of the parameter s\u0304, (far) above the resonance region, one has the duality relation\nZ\u221e\n\nds e\n\n\u2212s\u03c4\n\n\u03c1hadr (s) =\n\ns\u0304\n\nZ\u221e\n\nds e\u2212s\u03c4 \u03c1pert (s).\n\n(1.6)\n\ns\u0304\n\nIn order to express the excited-state contribution by the perturbative contribution, we need to extend this relationship\ndown to the value of the hadronic threshold sphys . However, one has to be careful: the spectral densities \u03c1pert (s) and\n\u03c1hadr (s) are obviously different in the region near sphys . Therefore, one finds\nZ\u221e\n\nds e\n\nsphys\n\n\u2212s\u03c4\n\n\u03c1hadr (s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nds e\u2212s\u03c4 \u03c1pert (s),\n\n(1.7)\n\nseff (\u03c4 )\n\nwhere seff (\u03c4 ) is different from the physical threshold sphys . A crucial (albeit rather obvious) observation is that, for the\nsame reason which causes seff (\u03c4 ) 6= sphys , seff (\u03c4 ) has to be a function of the parameter \u03c4 to render relation (1.7) exact.\nBy virtue of (1.7) we may rewrite the sum rule (1.3) as\n2\n2\n4 \u2212MQ\n\u03c4\nfQ\nMQ\ne\n\n=\n\nseff\nZ (\u03c4 )\n(mQ\n\nds e\u2212s\u03c4 \u03c1pert (s, \u03bc) + \u03a0power (\u03c4, \u03bc) \u2261 \u03a0dual (\u03c4, seff (\u03c4 )).\n\n(1.8)\n\n+m)2\n\nWe refer to the right-hand side of this equation as the dual correlator. Evidently, even if the QCD inputs \u03c1pert (s, \u03bc)\nand \u03a0power (\u03c4, \u03bc) are well-known, the extraction of the decay constant requires a further criterion for fixing the effective\ncontinuum threshold seff (\u03c4 ).\nNoteworthy, Eq. (1.8) offers another way to convince oneself that seff (\u03c4 ) must be a function of \u03c4 . In fact, the log slope\n2\non the left-hand side of (1.8) is independent of \u03c4 and is equal to MQ\n(which may be exactly known from experiment).\nConsequently, to guarantee the same \u03c4 -behaviour on the right-hand side of (1.8), the effective threshold must be, in\ngeneral, a function of \u03c4 . In the literature the approximation of the threshold by some constant s0 independent of \u03c4 is\nwidely used. The corresponding dual correlator, \u03a0dual (\u03c4, s0 ), should therefore lead to the presence of a contamination\nof excited states on the left-hand side of Eq. (1.8). In principle, one may develop models for excited states in order to\nestimate (and subsequently remove) such a contamination. It is, however, clear that ultimately the same effect can be\nequivalently reached by considering an explicit \u03c4 -dependence of the effective continuum threshold.\nThe exact effective continuum threshold -corresponding to exact values of the hadron mass and the decay constant\non the left-hand side-is, of course, not known. Therefore, the actual extraction of hadron parameters from a sum rule\nconsists in attempting (i) to find some reasonable approximation to the exact threshold and (ii) to control the accuracy\nof such an approximation. We stress again that the use of a \u03c4 -dependent threshold is expected to improve the reliability\nof the extraction of the hadron parameter considered compared with the standard procedure of assuming a constant,\n\u03c4 -independent threshold.\nLet us now look in detail at each step of the sum-rule calculation of the decay constant, starting with the OPE for\nthe correlator.\n2.\n\nOPE AND HEAVY-QUARK MASS\n\nWe use the perturbative spectral density \u03c1pert (s) calculated in [3] to three-loop accuracy in terms of the pole\nmass of the heavy quark. The pole mass has been used in most of the sum-rule analyses since the pioneering work\n[2]. An alternative option is to reorganize the perturbative expansion in terms of the running MS mass [4]. Since the\ncorrelator is known to \u03b12s -accuracy, the relationship between pole and MS mass to the same accuracy is used. Explicit\nexpressions for the perturbative spectral densities and power corrections may be found in [3, 4] and are not given here.\nFigure 1 shows the perturbative spectral densities and the sum-rule estimates for fD arising from (1.8) for our two\n\n\f3\nchoices of mc : the pole mass mc,pole and the running MS mass mc (\u03bc). The relevant OPE parameters are\nmc (mc ) = (1.279 \u00b1 0.013) GeV,\n\u03b1S (MZ ) = 0.1176 \u00b1 0.0020,\n\nm(2 GeV) = (3.5 \u00b1 0.5) MeV,\n\nhq\u0304qi(2 GeV) = \u2212((267 \u00b1 17) MeV)3 ,\n\nms (2 GeV) = (100 \u00b1 10) MeV,\n\nhs\u0304si(2 GeV)/hq\u0304qi(2 GeV) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3,\n\nD\u03b1\n\ns\n\n\u03c0\n\n(2.1)\nE\nGG = (0.024 \u00b1 0.012) GeV4 .\n\nWe employ a recent determination [5] of mc (mc ). The corresponding pole mass recalculated from the O(\u03b12s ) relation\nbetween mc and mc,pole is\nmc,pole = 1.682 GeV.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe sum-rule estimates shown in Fig. 1 are obtained for a \u03c4 -independent effective threshold s0 . Its values, which prove\nto be different for the pole-mass OPE and the MS-mass OPE, are found by requiring maximal stability of the extracted\ndecay constant. Obviously, for heavy-light correlators and the resulting decay constants it makes a very big difference\nwhich precise scheme for the heavy-quark mass is employed.\n\u008f\u008f\u008f L\nH\u0391 \u0090\u03a0 Li \u03a1iHs, \u039c =m\nc\n0.4\n\nH\u0391 \u0090\u03a0 Li \u03a1iHsL\n0.4\nPole-mass\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n0\n\ni=0 i=1 i=2 Full Pert\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nf 2 dual H\u03a4,s0 =4.7 GeVL\n0.04\n\n\u008f\u008f\u008f\u008f\u008f\nMS-mass\n\n0.3\n\n5\n\n6\n\ns\n\n-0.1\n\ni=0 i=1 i=2 Full Pert\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nf 2 dual H\u03a4,s0 =5.0 GeVL\n0.04\n\nPole-mass\n\n0.03\n\n5\n\n6\n\ns\n\n\u008f\u008f\u008f\u008f\u008f\nMS-mass\n\n0.03\nOH1L OH\u0391L OH\u03912 L power total\n\n0.02\n\nOH1L OH\u0391L OH\u03912 L power total\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a4\n\nFig. 1: OPE calculated in terms of the pole mass (left) and the MS mass (right) of the c quark. First line: spectral densities;\nsecond line: corresponding sum-rule estimates for fD . A constant effective continuum threshold s0 is fixed in each case separately\nby requiring \"maximal stability\" of the extracted decay constant. As the result, s0 turns out to be different in the two schemes.\n\nSeveral lessons should be learnt from these plots:\n(i) The perturbative expansion for the decay constant in terms of the pole mass shows no signs of convergence; each of\nthe terms-LO, NLO, NNLO-gives contributions of similar size. Therefore, there is no reason to expect higher orders\nto give smaller contributions.\n(ii) Reorganizing the perturbative series in terms of the MS mass of the heavy quark leads to a clear hierarchy of the\nperturbative contributions.\n(iii) The absolute value of the decay constant extracted from the pole-mass OPE (fD = 150 MeV) proves to be\nconsiderably smaller than that from the MS scheme (fD = 180 MeV). Let us emphasize that, nevertheless, in both\ncases the decay constant exhibits perfect stability in a wide range of the Borel parameter \u03c4 ! Thus we emphasize again\nthat mere Borel stability is by far not sufficient to guarantee the reliability of the sum-rule extraction of bound-state\nparameters. We have already observed this feature in several examples in quantum mechanics [6].\nBecause of the obvious problems with the pole-mass OPE for the correlator, we shall make use of the OPE in terms\nof the running MS mass for our extraction of the decay constants. Hereafter, the quark masses mQ and m, and the\nstrong coupling \u03b1s denote the MS running quantities at the scale \u03bc.\n\n\f4\n3.\n\nEXTRACTION OF THE DECAY CONSTANT\n\nIn order to determine the heavy-meson decay constant fQ from the OPE, we must execute the following two steps.\n1.\n\nThe Borel window\n\nFirst, we must fix our working \u03c4 -window where, on the one hand, the OPE gives a sufficiently accurate description of\nthe exact correlator (i.e., all higher-order radiative and power corrections are small) and, on the other hand, the ground\nstate gives a \"sizable\" contribution to the correlator. Since the radiative corrections to the condensates increase rather\nfast with \u03c4 , it is preferable to stay at the lowest possible values of \u03c4 . We shall therefore fix the window by the following\ncriteria [7, 8]: (a) In the window, power corrections \u03a0power (\u03c4 ) should not exceed 30% of the dual correlator \u03a0dual (\u03c4, s0 ).\nThis restricts the upper boundary of the \u03c4 -window. The ground-state contribution to the correlator at this value of \u03c4\ncomprises about 50% of the correlator. (b) The lower boundary of the \u03c4 -window is fixed by the requirement that the\nground-state contribution does not fall below 10%.\n2.\n\nThe effective continuum threshold\n\nSecond, we must define a criterion how to determine seff (\u03c4 ). The corresponding algorithm has been formulated in our\nrecent works [7, 8] and was shown to provide a good extraction of the ground-state parameters in quantum-mechanical\npotential models.\nLet us introduce the dual invariant mass Mdual and the dual decay constant fdual by the relations\n2\nMdual\n(\u03c4 ) \u2261 \u2212\n\nd\nlog \u03a0dual (\u03c4, seff (\u03c4 )),\nd\u03c4\n\n2\n\n\u22124 MQ \u03c4\n2\nfdual\n(\u03c4 ) \u2261 MQ\ne\n\u03a0dual (\u03c4, seff (\u03c4 )).\n\n(3.1)\n\nFor a properly constructed \u03a0dual (\u03c4, seff (\u03c4 )), this dual mass should coincide with the actual mass of the ground state. So,\nif the ground-state mass is known, any deviation of the dual mass from the actual mass of the ground state yields an\nindication of the contamination of the dual correlator by excited states.\nAssuming some particular functional form of the effective threshold and requiring the least deviation of the dual mass\n(3.1) from the actual mass in the \u03c4 -window entails a variational solution for the effective threshold; as soon as the latter\nhas been fixed, (3.1) yields the decay constant. The standard assumption for the effective threshold is a \u03c4 -independent\nconstant. In addition to this approximation, we also consider polynomials in \u03c4 .\nOur algorithm for the extraction of fQ makes use of the knowledge of the true PQ -meson mass MQ . This algorithm,\ndeveloped in our previous works and proven to work well for different correlators in the potential model, is very simple:\nwe consider the set of \u03c4 -dependent Ans\u00e4tze for the effective continuum threshold\n(n)\nseff (\u03c4 )\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n(n)\n\nsj \u03c4 j .\n\n(3.2)\n\nj=0\n\nWe fix the parameters on the right-hand side of (3.2) as follows: we compute the dual mass squared according to (3.1)\n2\nfor the \u03c4 -dependent seff (\u03c4 ) in (3.2). We then evaluate Mdual\n(\u03c4 ) at several values of \u03c4 = \u03c4i (i = 1, 2, . . . , N , where N can\n2\nbe taken arbitrary large) chosen uniformly in the window. Finally, we minimize the squared difference between Mdual\n2\nand the known value MB :\n\u03c72 \u2261\n(n)\n\nN\n\u0003\n1 X\u0002 2\n2 2\n.\nMdual (\u03c4i ) \u2212 MQ\nN i=1\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis gives us the coefficients sj of the effective continuum threshold. As soon as the latter is fixed, it is straightforward\nto calculate the decay constant.\nThe results presented below indicate that accounting for the \u03c4 -dependence of the effective threshold yields a visible\nimprovement compared with the usual assumption of a \u03c4 -independent quantity in the following respect: it leads to a\nmuch better stability of the dual mass calculated for a dual correlator, which is tantamount to a better isolation of the\nground-state contribution.\nStill, by trying different Ans\u00e4tze for the effective continuum threshold, one obtains different estimates for the\ndecay constant. We discuss the interpretation of these results in connection with the systematic uncertainties of the\nmethod of sum rules.\n\n\f5\n3.\n\nUncertainties in the extracted decay constant\n\nClearly, the extracted value of the decay constant is sensitive to the precise values of the OPE parameters and to the\nprescription for fixing the effective continuum threshold. The corresponding errors in the resulting decay constants are\ncalled the OPE-related error and the systematic error, respectively. Let us discuss these in turn.\nOPE-related error\nThe value of the OPE-related error is obtained as follows: We perform a bootstrap analysis [9] by allowing the OPE\nparameters to vary over the ranges indicated in (2.1), using 1000 bootstrap events. Gaussian distributions for all OPE\nparameters but \u03bc are employed. For \u03bc we assume a uniform distribution in the corresponding range, which we choose\nto be 1 \u2264 \u03bc (GeV) \u2264 3 for charmed mesons and 2 \u2264 \u03bc (GeV) \u2264 8 for beauty mesons. The resulting distribution of the\ndecay constant turns out to be close to Gaussian shape. Therefore, the quoted OPE-related error is a Gaussian error.\nSystematic error\nThe systematic error of some hadron parameter determined by the method of sum rules (i.e., the error related to the\nintrinsic limited accuracy of this method) represents the perhaps most subtle point in the applications of this method.\nSo far no way to arrive at a rigorous-in the mathematical sense-systematic error has been proposed. Therefore, in\nthis respect we have to rely on our experience obtained from the examples where the exact hadron parameters may be\ncalculated independently from the method of dispersive sum rules and then compared with the results of the sum-rule\napproach. Recent experience from potential models shows that the band of values obtained from linear, quadratic, and\ncubic Ans\u00e4tze for the effective threshold encompasses the true value of the decay constant [7]. Moreover, we could show\nthat the extraction procedures in quantum mechanics and in QCD are even quantitatively rather similar [8]. Therefore,\nwe believe that the half-width of this band may be regarded as realistic estimate for the systematic uncertainty of the\ndecay constant. Presently, we do not see other possibilities to obtain a more reliable estimate for the systematic error.\nA.\n\nDecay constant of the D meson\n\nThe \u03c4 -window for the charmed mesons, \u03c4 = (0.1 \u2212 0.5) GeV\u22122 , is chosen according to the criteria formulated above.\nFigure 2 shows the application of our procedure of fixing the effective continuum threshold and extracting the resulting\nfD . We would like to point out that, in the window, the \u03c4 -dependent effective thresholds reproduce the meson mass\nmuch better than the constant one (Fig. 2a). This signals that the dual correlators corresponding to the \u03c4 -dependent\nthresholds are less contaminated by excited states.\nMdual\u0090MD\n1.02\n1.01\n\nfdual@MeVD\n230\n220\n210\n200\n190\n180\n170\n\nn=0\nn=1\n\n1\n\nn=2 n=3\n\n0.99\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03a4@GeV-2 D\n\n0.1\n\nfD @MeVD\n230\n220\n210\n200\n190\n180\n170 n=0 n=1 n=2 n=3\n\nn=2\nn=3\nn=1\nn=0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03a4@GeV-2 D\n1.15\n\n1.2\n\n1.25\n\n1.3\n\nmc @GeVD\n1.35\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 2: Dual mass (a) and dual decay constant (b) of the D meson obtained using different Ans\u00e4tze for the effective continuum\nthreshold seff (\u03c4 ) (3.2) and fixing all thresholds according to (3.3).

The triangle represents the experimental value from PDG [14]. For the\n\u03c4 -dependent QCD-SR result the error shown is the sum of the OPE and systematic uncertainties in (3.5), added in quadrature.\n\nOPE uncertainty is the Gaussian error. Adding the half-width of the band deduced from our \u03c4 -dependent Ans\u00e4tze for\nthe effective continuum threshold of degree n = 1, 2, 3 as the (intrinsic) systematic error, we obtain the following result:\n\u0001\nfD = 206.2 \u00b1 7.3(OPE) \u00b1 5.1(syst) MeV.\n(3.5)\n\nThe main sources of the OPE uncertainty in the extracted fD are its renormalization-scale dependence and the error of\nthe quark condensate.\nFor a \u03c4 -independent Ansatz for the effective continuum threshold a bootstrap analysis entails the substantially lower\n\u0001\n(n=0)\nrange fD\n= 181.3 \u00b1 7.4(OPE) MeV, which differs from our \u03c4 -dependent result (3.5) by \u2243 10%, i.e., by almost three\ntimes the OPE uncertainty. Moreover, as we have already shown in our previous works [6], making use of merely the\nconstant Ansatz for the effective continuum threshold does not allow one to probe at all the intrinsic systematic error\nof the QCD sum rule. From our result (3.5) the latter turns out to be of the same order as the OPE uncertainty.\nAllowing the threshold to depend on \u03c4 leads to a clearly visible effect and brings the results from QCD sum rules into\nperfect agreement with recent lattice results and the experimental data (Fig. 3b). This perfect agreement of our result\nwith both experimental data and lattice results provides a strong argument in favour of the reliability of our procedure.\nB.\n\nDecay constant of Ds meson\n\nThe corresponding \u03c4 -window is \u03c4 = (0.1\u22120.6) GeV\u22122 .

The\nerror in (3.8) arises mainly from the uncertainties in the quark condensates hs\u0304si/hq\u0304qi = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3.\n4.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe presented a detailed analysis of the decay constants of charmed heavy mesons with the help of QCD sum rules.\nParticular emphasis was laid on the study of the uncertainties in the extracted values of the decay constants: the OPE\nuncertainty related to the not precisely known QCD parameters and the intrinsic uncertainty of the sum-rule method\nrelated to a limited accuracy of the extraction procedure.\nOur main findings may be summarized as follows.\n(i) The perturbative expansion of the two-point function in terms of the pole mass of the heavy quark exhibits\nno sign of convergence. However, reorganizing this expansion in terms of the corresponding running mass leads to a\nclear hierarchy of the perturbative contributions. Interestingly, the decay constant extracted from the pole-mass OPE\n\n\f8\nproves to be sizeably smaller than the one extracted from the running-mass OPE. In spite of this numerical difference,\nthe decay constants extracted from these two correlators exhibit perfect stability in the Borel parameter. This example\nshows that stability per se does not guarantee the reliability of the sum-rule extraction of any bound-state parameter.\n(ii) We have made use of the Borel-parameter-dependent effective threshold for the extraction of the decay constants.\nThe \u03c4 -dependence of the effective threshold emerges quite naturally when one attempts to increase the accuracy of the\nduality approximation. According to our algorithm, one should consider different polynomial Ans\u00e4tze for the effective\nthreshold and fix the coefficients in these Ans\u00e4tze by minimizing the deviation of the dual mass from the known actual\nmeson mass in the window. Then, the band of values corresponding to the linear, quadratic, and cubic Ans\u00e4tze reflects\nthe intrinsic uncertainty of the method of sum rules. The efficiency of this criterion has been tested before for several\nexamples of quantum-mechanical models. This strategy has now been applied to the decay constants of heavy mesons.\n(iii) We obtained the following sum-rule estimates for the decay constants of the charmed D and Ds mesons:\n\u0001\nfD = 206.2 \u00b1 7.3(OPE) \u00b1 5.1(syst) MeV,\n(4.1)\n\u0001\n(4.2)\nfDs = 245.3 \u00b1 15.7(OPE) \u00b1 4.5(syst) MeV.\n\nWe point out that we provide both the OPE uncertainties and the intrinsic (systematic) uncertainty of the method of\nsum rules related to the limited accuracy of the extraction procedure. In the case of fD the latter turns out to be of the\nsame order as the OPE uncertainty. Noteworthy, adopting a \u03c4 -independent effective threshold leads to a substantially\n\u0001\n(n=0)\nlower range fD\n= 181.3 \u00b1 7.4(OPE) MeV, which differs from our \u03c4 -dependent result (4.1) by almost three times\nthe OPE uncertainty. The resulting ratio of the decay constants is\nfDs /fD = 1.193 \u00b1 0.025(OPE) \u00b1 0.007(syst) .\n\n(4.3)\n\n(iv) Our study of charmed mesons clearly demonstrates that the use of Borel-parameter-dependent thresholds leads\nto two essential improvements:\na. The actual accuracy of the decay constants extracted from sum rules improves considerably.\nb. Our algorithm yields realistic (although not entirely rigorous) estimates for the systematic errors and allows one to\nreduce their values to the level of a few percent. Due to the application of our prescription, the QCD sum-rule results\nare brought into perfect agreement both with the experimental results and with lattice QCD.\nAcknowledgements.
