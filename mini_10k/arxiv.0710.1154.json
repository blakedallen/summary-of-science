Introduction\nQuark confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking are the two most prominent phenomena of infrared QCD. Recent Monte-Carlo lattice calculations made clear that there is, at least\nfor quarks in the fundamental representation, a close and yet not fully understood relation between\nthese two properties of QCD. E.g. the spectral properties of the Dirac operator reflect both, confinement and chiral symmetry breaking [1]. It is the central aim of this talk to shed light onto this\nissue from the point of view of QCD Green functions in the Landau gauge.\nIn this and related functional approaches dynamical chiral symmetry breaking finds a direct\nexplanation [2], the main challenge for such non-perturbative methods is posed by the properties of\nthe linearly rising static quark-antiquark potential. There have been many quite different attempts to\nrelate the properties of this potential to properties of QCD, and thus explain quark confinement. In\nref. [3] some of these pictures have been briefly reviewed. These explanations for confinement are\nseemingly different but there are surprising relations between them which are not yet understood.\nGiven the current status one has to note that these theories are definitely not mutually exclusive but\nsimply reveal only different aspects of the confinement phenomenon. And into one special facet,\nthe above mentioned relation to broken chiral symmetry, there is novel insight from the Landau\ngauge Greens functions approach.\n\n2. Infrared Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge\n2.1 Infrared Exponents of Gluons and Ghosts\n\n=\n\n+\n\nq\u2212l\nl\nq\n\nFigure 1: The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the ghost-gluon vertex.\n\nLet us start by looking at the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the ghost-gluon vertex function\nas depicted in fig. 1. In the Landau gauge the gluon propagator is transverse, and therefore one can\nemploy the relation\nl\u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (l \u2212 q) = q\u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (l \u2212 q) ,\n(2.1)\nto conclude that the ghost-gluon vertex stays finite when the outgoing ghost momentum vanishes,\ni.e. when q\u03bc \u2192 0 [4]. This argument is valid to all orders in perturbation theory, a truely nonperturbative justification of the infrared finiteness of this vertex has been given in refs. [5, 6, 7].\nUsing this property of the ghost-gluon vertex the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the ghost\npropagator, see fig. 2, can be analysed. The only unknowns in the deep infrared are the gluon and\nthe ghost propagators:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\nZ(k2 )\nG(k2 )\nD\u03bc\u03bd (k) = 2\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\n(2.2)\n, DG (k) = \u2212 2 .\nk\nk\nk\n2\n\n\fDynamically induced scalar quark confinement\n\nReinhard Alkofer\n\nFigure 2: The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the ghost propagator.\n\nIn Landau gauge these (Euclidean) propagators are parametrized by two invariant functions, Z(k2 )\nand G(k2 ), respectively. As solutions of renormalized equations, these functions depend also on\nthe renormalization scale \u03bc . Furthermore, assuming that QCD Green functions can be expanded\nin asymptotic series, the integral in the ghost Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation can be split up in three\npieces: an infrared integral, an ultraviolet integral, and an expression for the ghost wave function\nrenormalization. Hereby it is the resulting equation for the latter quantity which allows one to\nextract definite information [8] without using any truncation or ansatz.\nOne obtains that the infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators is given by power\nlaws, and that the exponents are uniquely related such that the gluon exponent is -2 times the ghost\nexponent [9]. As we will see later on this implies an infrared fixed point for the corresponding running coupling. The signs of the exponents are such that the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed\nas compared to the one for a free particle, the ghost propagator is infrared enhanced.\n\nFigure 3: The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the 3-gluon vertex.\n\nGiven the infrared power laws, that the Yang-Mills propagators obey, one can infer the infrared\nbehaviour of higher n-point functions. To this end the n-point Dyson-Schwinger equations have\nbeen studied in a skeleton expansion, i.e. a loop expansion using dressed propagators and vertices.\nFurthermore, an asymptotic expansion has been applied to all primitively divergent Green functions [10]. As an example consider the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the 3-gluon vertex which is\ndiagrammatically represented in fig. 3. Its skeleton expansion, see fig. 4, can be constructed via the\n\nFigure 4: An example for the skeleton expansion of the 3-gluon vertex.\n\ninsertions given in fig. 5. These insertions have vanishing infrared anomalous dimensions which\nimplies that the resulting higher order terms feature the same infrared scaling. Based on this the\n3\n\n\fDynamically induced scalar quark confinement\n\nReinhard Alkofer\n\nFigure 5: Insertions to reconstruct higher orders in the skeleton expansion.\n\nfollowing general infrared behaviour for one-particle irreducible Green functions with 2n external\nghost legs and m external gluon legs can be derived[10, 11]:\n\u0393n,m (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )(n\u2212m)\u03ba +(1\u2212n)(d/2\u22122)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03ba is one yet undetermined parameter, and d is the space-time dimension. Exploiting DysonSchwinger equations and Exact Renormalization Group Equations one can show that this infrared\nsolution is unique [12].\n2.2 Infrared fixed point of the Yang-Mills running coupling\nThe infrared behaviour (2.3) especially includes\nG(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u2212\u03ba ,\n\nZ(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )2\u03ba\n\n\u03933g (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u22123\u03ba ,\n\n\u03934g (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u22124\u03ba\n\n(2.4)\n\nand therefore the running couplings related to these vertex functions possess an infrared fixed point:\nconstgh\u2212gl\n,\nNc\nconst4g\n\u03b1 4g (p2 ) = \u03b1\u03bc \u03934g (p2 ) Z 2 (p2 ) \u223c\n.\nNc\n\n\u03b1 gh\u2212gl (p2 ) = \u03b1\u03bc G2 (p2 ) Z(p2 ) \u223c\n\n\u03b1 3g (p2 ) = \u03b1\u03bc [\u03933g (p2 )]2 Z 3 (p2 ) \u223c\n\nconst3g\n,\nNc\n(2.5)\n\nThe infrared value of the coupling related to the ghost-gluon vertex can be computed[5, 13]:\n4\u03c0 \u0393(3 \u2212 2\u03ba )\u0393(3 + \u03ba )\u0393(1 + \u03ba )\n(2.6)\n6Nc\n\u03932 (2 \u2212 \u03ba )\u0393(2\u03ba )\n\u221a\nThis yields \u03b1 gh\u2212gl (0) = 2.972 for Nc = 3 and \u03ba = (93 \u2212 1201)/98 \u2243 0.595353, which is the\nvalue obtained with a bare ghost-gluon vertex.\n\n\u03b1 gh\u2212gl (0) =\n\n2.3 Positivity violation for the gluon propagator\nPositivity violation of the propagator of transverse gluons has been for a long time a conjecture\nwhich has been supported recently, see e.g. [14, 15] and references therein. The basic feature is\nhereby the infrared suppression of transverse gluons caused by the infrared enhancement of ghosts.\nAs this behaviour clearly signals the confinement of tranverse gluons [16] it is certainly worth to\nhave a closer look at the underlying analytic structure of the gluon propagator.\nNote that the infrared exponent \u03ba is an irrational number. Given the infrared power laws this\nimplies already that the gluon propagator possesses a cut on the negative real p2 axis. It is possible\nto fit the solution for the gluon propagator quite accurately without introducing further singularities\nin the complex p2 plane [14]:\n!2\u03ba\n\u0001\np2\n2 \u2212\u03b3\n2\n\u03b1\n.\n(2.7)\n(p\n)\nZfit (p ) = w\nfit\n\u039b2QCD + p2\n4\n\n\fDynamically induced scalar quark confinement\n\nReinhard Alkofer\n\nw is a normalization parameter, and \u03b3 = (\u221213Nc + 4N f )/(22Nc \u2212 4N f ) is the one-loop value for\nthe anomalous dimension of the gluon propagator. The running coupling is expressed as [17]:\n!\n2\np\n4\n1\n1\n(0)\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\nS\n\u03b1fit (p2 ) =\n+\n\u2212\n(2.8)\n1 + p2 /\u039b2QCD \u03b20 \u039b2QCD + p2 ln(p2 /\u039b2QCD ) p2 /\u039b2QCD \u2212 1\nwith \u03b20 = (11Nc \u2212 2N f )/3. It is important to note that the gluon propagator (2.7) possesses a form\nsuch that Wick rotation is possible!\n\n3. Dynamically induced scalar quark confinement\nThe above presented results provide an explanation how gluon confinement works in a covariant gauge, but due to the infrared suppression of the gluon propagator quark confinement seems\neven more mysterious than ever. To proceed as in the above described studies the Dyson-Schwinger\nequation for the quark propagator is analyzed with the result that the structure of the quark propagator depends crucially on the quark-gluon vertex [2, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Therefore a detailed study of\nthis three-point function, and especially its infrared behaviour, is mandatory. Its Dyson-Schwinger\nequation is diagrammatically depicted in fig. 6, its skeleton expansion in fig. 7. But there is a\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 6: The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the quark-gluon vertex.\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 7: Some leading terms in the skeleton expansion for the quark-gluon vertex.\n\ndrastic difference of the quarks as compared to Yang-Mills fields: They possess a current mass.\nEven if this were not the case one expects dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and thus dynamical\nmass generation to occur.\nTo generalize the infrared analysis of the Yang-Mills theory to full QCD [21] one concentrates\nfirst on the quark sector of quenched QCD and chooses the masses of the valence quarks to be\nlarge, i.e. m > \u039bQCD . The remaining scales below \u039bQCD are those of the external momenta of the\npropagators and vertex functions. Then the Dyson-Schwinger equations can be used to determine\nthe selfconsistent solutions in terms of powers of the small external momentum scale p2 \u226a \u039b2QCD .\nThe equations which have to be considered in addition to the ones of Yang-Mills theory are the one\nfor the quark propagator and the quark-gluon vertex.\n5\n\n\fDynamically induced scalar quark confinement\n\nReinhard Alkofer\n\nThe full quark-gluon vertex \u0393\u03bc can consist of up to twelve linearly independent Dirac tensors. Some of those would vanish if chiral symmetry would be realized in the Wigner-Weyl mode:\nThese tensor structures can be non-vanishing either if chiral symmetry is explicitely broken by current masses and/or chiral symmetry is realized in the Nambu-Goldstone mode (i.e. spontaneously\nbroken). From a solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equations we infer that these \"Dirac-scalar\"\nstructures are, in the chiral limit, generated non-perturbatively together with the dynamical quark\nmass function in a self-consistent fashion: Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking reflects itself not\nonly in the propagator but also in the quark-gluon vertex function.\nFrom such an infrared analysis one obtains an infrared divergent solution for the quark-gluon\nvertex such that Dirac vector and \"scalar\" components of this vertex are infrared divergent with\nexponent \u2212\u03ba \u2212 12 [21]. A numerical solution of a truncated set of Dyson-Schwinger equations\nconfirms this infrared behavior. The driving pieces of this solution are the scalar Dirac amplitudes\nof the quark-gluon vertex and the scalar part of the quark propagator. Both pieces are only present\nwhen chiral symmetry is broken, either explicitely or dynamically.\nFor the coupling related to the quark-gluon vertex we obtain\n\n\u03b1 qg (p2 ) = \u03b1\u03bc [\u0393qg (p2 )]2 [Z f (p2 )]2 Z(p2 ) \u223c\nusing that\n\nconstqg 1\n,\nNc p2\n\n\u0393qg (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u22121/2\u2212\u03ba , Z f (p2 ) \u223c const , Z(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )2\u03ba .\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nNote that the coupling (3.1) is singular in the infrared contrary to the couplings from the Yang-Mills\nvertices.\nIn a next step the anomalous infrared exponent of the four-quark function is determined. Note\nthat the static quark potential can be obtained from this four-quark one-particle irreducible Greens\nfunction, which, including the canonical dimensions, behaves like (p2 )\u22122 for p2 \u2192 0. Therefore\nemploying the well-known relation for a function F \u221d (p2 )\u22122 one obtains\nV (r) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 p\nF(p0 = 0, p)eipr \u223c |r|\n(2\u03c0 )3\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor the static quark-antiquark potential V (r). We conclude at this point that, given the infrared\ndivergence of the quark-gluon vertex as found in the solution of the coupled system of DysonSchwinger equations, the vertex overcompensates the infared suppression of the gluon propagator,\nand one therefore obtains a linear rising potential. In addition, this potential is dynamically induced\nand has a strong scalar component.\nTo elucidate the here found relation between chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement\nwe keep chiral symmetry artificially in the Wigner-Weyl mode, i.e. in the chiral limit we force the\nquark mass term as well as the \"scalar\" terms in the quark-gluon vertex to be zero. We then find that\nthe resulting running coupling from the quark-gluon vertex is no longer diverging but goes to a fixed\npoint in the infrared similar to the couplings from the Yang-Mills vertices. Correspondingly, one\nobtains a 1/r behaviour of the static quark potential. The \"forced\" restoration of chiral symmetry\nis therefore directly linked with the disappearance of quark confinement. The infared properties of\nthe quark-gluon vertex in the \"unforced\" solution thus constitute a novel mechanism that directly\nlinks chiral symmetry breaking with confinement.\n6\n\n\fDynamically induced scalar quark confinement\n\nReinhard Alkofer\n\n4. Summary\nIn this talk we have reported on results of functional approaches to infrared QCD in the Landau gauge. We have elucidated the mechanism for gluon confinement: Positivity of transverse\ngluons is violated. Furthermore, in the Yang-Mills sector the strong running coupling is infrared\nfinite whereas the running coupling from the quark-gluon vertex is infrared divergent. Chiral symmetry is dynamically broken, and this takes place in the quark propagator and the quark-gluon\nvertex. We have provided clear evidence that static quark confinement in the Landau gauge is due\nto the infrared divergence of the quark-gluon vertex. In the infrared this vertex has strong scalar\ncomponents which induce a relation between confinement and broken chiral symmetry.\n\nAcknowledgements\nRA thanks the organisers of Lattice 2007 for all their efforts which made this extraordinary conference possible.
