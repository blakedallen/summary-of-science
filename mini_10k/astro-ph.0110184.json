INTRODUCTION\nThe Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee of the National Research Council Decadal Report, Astronomy\nand Astrophysics in the new Millennium [1] has listed National Virtual Observatory (NVO) as the highest priority\nitem in the small program category. The report reflects the community wide effort to harness the possibilities that\nmulti-terrabyte and multi-petabyte sky surveys are opening to the astronomy community. In parallel with the efforts\nhere in the United States, various other places are involved in contributing to a Virtual Observatory (VO). Here we\nwill use the term VO in a broad, generic sense. Besides the traditional multi-wavelength surveys, the newer surveys\nalso encompass the time domain. The huge amount of data needs new tools, techniques and a new way of doing\nastronomy. In the next few pages we discuss Topic Maps (TM) as such a tool.\nDifferent models and paradigms for a VO are under consideration. The commonality between all these is that\nit will be web based and will provide transparent access to a variety of datasets using tailored and/or user supplied\ntools. Many different issues have to be considered including various standards for data storage, transmission and\ninterchange. Though different survey teams that will form part of the VO will store the databases internally using\ndifferent methodologies XML is the emerging standard to interface the data with the rest of the world. This is mainly\nbecause the internet has become the de facto medium for exchanging data. It is for this reason that all flavors of\nVO are web-based. The most important feature of the VO will be to allow access to desired information in a quick\nand systematic way. XML allows for excellent structuring of information. However XML itself is not good enough\nfor the intelligent maneuvering necessary in the large dataspace. Topic Maps are an ideal solution to this problem.\nWith TMs one can define complex knowledge structures and attribute them as metadata to information resources\nallowing one to systematically organize knowledge on a variety of data subjects such that the retrieval and sharing\nwith other users is easy.\nTo use an analogy, TMs (plus a Topic Map Query language) are to XML documents what SQL is to databases.\nBut TMs can do more than what SQL does for the following reasons: (1) use of associations to qualify occurrences\nin TMs, (2) ability of TMs to describe abstract constructs, and (3) the ability of TMs to exist independent of an\ninformation pool. These three features together allow TMs to be employed for asking exact questions and getting to\nthe right datum in the data Himalayas.\nTopic Maps are still new and are likely to develop a lot in the next few years. They will be useful anyplace where\nKnowledge Organization (KO) is useful. However, even at this early stage we can see three distinct areas in which\nTopic Maps can serve the VO:\nTo appear in SPIE Annual Meeting 2001 proceedings (Astronomical Data Analysis)\nSend correspondence to Ashish Mahabal.

A Topic Map can contain a large number of topics. A small selection of astronomical topics is shown\nhere which can go into forming a Topic Map. The Topic Map itself is not shown. Different topic types have been\nshown using different symbols. A given topic can belong to more than one topic type. Similarly, a topic can have\nmore than one name.\n1. Enhanced searching for references and pointers to various objects and keywords,\n2. Searching for available observations of a given object, and\n3. Providing knowledge organization in federated datasets.\nWe begin by describing in Sect. 2 what Topic Maps are. In Sect. 3 we outline a paradigm for the VO and describe\nhow TMs become the natural tool for various information extraction processes. In Sect. 4 we describe the three areas\nof Topic Map application mentioned above. Finally, in Sect. 5, we discuss the current status of topic maps with\nrespect to the availability of resources and engines and compatibility issues. In the appendix we present excerpts\nfrom an example Topic Map and the Topic Map schema.\n\n2. WHAT IS A TOPIC MAP\nA Topic Map is a collection of topics linked together by associations between the topics. The topics can occur in\ndifferent contexts and the associations qualify the occurrences. In XMLspeak a Topic Map (which itself is an XML\nfile) is a structured network of hyperlinks above an information pool (which is a set of one or more XML files). Each\nnode is a named topic. Associations between nodes are expressed by links. The named topics can be just about\nanything thereby allowing a Topic Map to discuss abstract relationships between different topics. Depending on the\nsituation, different terms could be chosen to be regarded as topics.\nHere is a summary of various concepts associated with a topic:\n\u2022 Each Topic has one or more Topic Types e.g. topic NGC 4261 is of type \"galaxy\" and topic Europa is of type\n\"satellite\". Topic types are also topics. Figure 1 shows a few topics in an information pool.\n\u2022 A topic also has one or more Occurrences. Each occurrence is a link to a relevant information resource of the\ntopic. An occurrence is generally outside a Topic Map and is pointed to using some addressing mechanism\n(e.g. XLink or XPointer). Examples are:\n2\n\n\fOccurances\n\nNGC 4261\n\nNGC 661\n\nInformation\nPool\n\nDust Lane\n\nFigure 2. Occurrences for a few topics from an information pool have been shown. A single topic may have multiple\noccurrences in different contexts. Here NGC 4261, an elliptical galaxy, is shown to occur in connection with a dust\nlane and with NGC 661, another elliptical galaxy.\n\u2013 A paper on NGC 4261 entitled \"The blackhole of NGC 4261\" is an occurrence for the topic NGC 4261,\n\u2013 A mention that the dust lane in NGC 4261 is \"not similar to\" that of NGC 661 is another occurrence for\nNGC 4261,\n\u2013 Presence of NGC 4261 in the NGC catalog is yet another occurrence,\n\u2013 Mass of dust in NGC 4261 present in some compilation is yet another possibility,\n\u2013 A picture of NGC 4261 in the HST archive.\nThe occurrences lie in a different plane from the topics as shown in Fig. 2.\n\u2022 Each topic occurrence has one or more Occurrence Roles: These are topics in their own right e.g. consider\n\"LMC is a satellite of the Galaxy\". This is an occurrence for the topic LMC. The role it plays is that of being\na satellite. Also, in the example above, different occurrences of NGC 4261 have different occurrence roles viz.\narticle, picture etc.\n\u2022 A topic also has an Association and an Association Type. In the example of LMC above, \"is a satellite of\"\ndescribes the topic association between LMC and our Galaxy. Thus associations denote the relationships\nbetween topics. Associations can be grouped by their type. The grouping by association type make large\ndatabases amenable to quick navigation. In that respect Topic Maps are extensions of glossaries: the only\nrelationship that a glossary denotes is the definition. The associations between topics are denoted using link\nelements asserting the appropriate relationship. See Fig. 3 for a few associations.\nIn Topic Maps, associations are by definition bilateral i.e. for each association between two topics, a reverse\nassociation exists in the other direction. LMC \"is a satellite of\" the Galaxy has the following reciprocal\nassociation: the Galaxy \"forms the main gravitational potential for\" or \"is orbited by\" the LMC.\nAssociations may or may not be symmetric (a \u2192 b => b \u2192 a) e.g. Lyra \u03b6 is the binary companion of Lyra \u03b9 is\nsymmetric with Lyra \u03b9 is the binary companion of Lyra \u03b6, but Europa is the satellite of Jupiter does not have\na symmetric association that is true.\nSimilarly, associations may or may not be transitive (a \u2192 b, b \u2192 c => a \u2192 c). An example of a transitive\nassociation is that Europa is part of the Jovian system and the Jovian system is part of our Solar System\ntogether imply that Europa is part of our Solar System. An example of a non-transitive association is the\nfollowing. Europa is a satellite of Jupiter and Jupiter is a satellite of the Sun (in the broader sense of the word\nsatellite). However, Europa is not a satellite of the Sun.\n3\n\n\fAssociations\n\nis\u2212orbited\u2212by\n\nis\u2212feature\u2212of\n\nInformation\nPool\n\n\u2721\nNGC 4261\n\nJupiter\n\nSun\n\nEuropa\n\nDust Lane\n\nFigure 3. Associations are a key feature of Topic Maps. Associations provide links between different topics when\na Topic Map is overlaid on an information resource. In this figure two association types are shown: (1) a dust lane\n\"is a feature of\" a galaxy, and (2) two associations involving the \"is orbited by\" relationship.\nTo an extent, topic associations are like cross-references. However, there is an important distinction: a crossreference associates two items within an information resource. On the other hand, an association links two\nitems independent of information resources. As a result, one can talk of Topic Maps as independent information\nresources in their own right (see Fig. 4). A Topic Map can then be overlaid on different information pools, or\ntwo Topic Maps can be merged or interchanged.\n\u2022 A topic has a specific Scope in a given context. It denotes the limit of validity of an assignment e.g. Europa is\nan astronomical body in its own right. We talk about it as a satellite only with respect to its relationship with\nJupiter. Different themes define different scopes e.g. under the theme \"radio universe\", NGC 4261 is a radio\ngalaxy with FR II structure (where NGC 4261 is the public name associated with 3C270 \u2013 see below) and under\nthe theme \"optical universe\" NGC 4261 is an elliptical galaxy. If there are two separate Topic Maps for the radio\nuniverse and the optical universe, they could be merged using the common or public identifiers like NGC 4261.\nIn astronomy the coordinate positions available in different catalogs for the same object can vary slightly and\nit will be more prudent to use RA-Dec pair for public names (for objects having small proper motions in any\ncase) and truncate the values to account for the error bars in different catalogs to get associations.\n\u2022 A topic has one or more Facets. Facets are like properties and help assign property-value pairs. The difference\nwith scoping is that it groups on properties of topics and not on properties of the information resource. Facets\nare the windows to the associated metadata and allow for the filtering of information resources. Thus facets\nprovide the metadata that would have been provided by XML attributes. For example, for an observation,\nthis could include attributes such as \"observer\", \"telescope\", \"instrument\", \"filter\". These provide additional\nclassification possibilities viz. faceted classification (though not in the same sense as used in the KO jargon). One\ncould then search for, for example, not only the observations of NGC 4261, but for spectroscopic observations\nof NGC 4261 taken at a 4m+ telescope and so on.\n\u2022 Finally, a topic has a Public Subject. This can be used to combine different topic names belonging to the same\ntopic under different contexts. Thus, NGC 4261 could be the public subject of 3C270. The public subject is in\n\n4\n\n\fAssociations\n\nis\u2212orbited\u2212by\n\nis\u2212feature\u2212of\n\nInformation\nPool\n\nFigure 4. The most important factor that distinguishes a topic association from a cross-reference is its ability to\nexist despite the absence of an information resource to go with it. Associations in a Topic Map have a life on their\nown. In the figure the information pool is blank. However, when a set of associations is defined as part of a Topic\nMap, one can simply move it over another appropriate information resource and make it work. This is what makes\nthe merging and interchange of Topic Maps easy.\naddition to the base name, display name, or sort name that a topic can have. A point to note is that a topic\nneed not have a name. That happens when the topic exists only as a reference.\nBecause of the different occurrence roles, main descriptions (important pointers) of an object can be separated\nfrom the rest. When searching in a large information pool this becomes a boon. Using different Topic Maps we can\ndenote different occurrences as more important in different contexts. As a result, different Topic Maps provide us\nwith different perspectives of the same dataset. In addition, different TMs can be merged to provide a composite\nview of multiple datasets. In some sense, TMs are to XML files what SQL is to traditional databases. XML is good\nfor structuring information, but it is not good for retrieval on its own. TMs are good for segregating information\nthat results from a query. While tools have existed to deal with semantic networks and knowledge structures, the\npresence of topic associations and occurrence roles gives Topic Maps an extra edge in knowledge representation.\nTo a great extent TMs are like Resource Description Framework (RDF) which is likely to be the workhorse for\nSemantic Networks. However, the main advantage of TMs is that they have stronger semantics than RDF (see [2]\nand [3] for more details). What that means is that a converter could, in principle, make an RDF document from a\nTopic Map. However, the RDF interpreter will not be able to make complete sense of the resulting document since\nthe underlying semantic structure will be lost. The other factor that favors the use of TMs for the web based VO is\nthat while RDF can point to arbitrary resources, TMs are restricted to the web.\n\n3. A SKETCH OF VO\nIn this section we discuss an approximate common denominator paradigm for the VO. The VO will be distributed\nand will allow access to a variety of datasets. The tools available will not only enhance the capabilities for doing\nscience, but will also enable entirely new scientific investigations. A block structure for the VO is depicted in Fig. 5.\nThe biggest block is shown to be the VO itself. It will comprise of various tools that will allow users to play with\nthe data.

A schematic of a Virtual Observatory. The main functionality of the VO is to make data available from\nthose who have it to those who will use it. The input data is in the form of observations, theory and simulations.\nMany kinds of interfaces will allow the data to flow in different formats to researchers, educators and the general\npublic. Numbers 1, 2 and 3 denote the different access or clearance levels, 1 being the highest.\nbe various interfaces that will allow users to interact with the VO. There will be a multitude of codes available to\ndo statistical analysis, classification etc. These could be user supplied and optional. Visualization portals will allow\nfly-throughs to look at multi-dimensional data for searching, for example, rare objects. Metadata translators will\nbe at the heart of all the above, perhaps hidden from view quietly converting various data to the requested output\nformats. This is where XML will be hard at work maintaining the structure of the data. All transactions will be\nthrough some query mechanism. Many queries will result in very large datasets. A tool is needed to make sense of\nsuch output data. As mentioned before, Topic Maps fit the bill.\nThe bulk of VO will be formed by observational archives at different wavelengths and LSST-like surveys involving\nthe time domain. In addition, there will be significant inputs from theory in form of models. Simulations will\ncontribute on an almost equal footing in form of simulated datasets from which catalogs can be derived and then\ncompared with actual observations. A large part of the remaining input will be formed by follow-up observations,\nstand alone observations by individual observers, self-contained observations and deeper but less extensive surveys.\nOne can envisage the access to VO to be in 3 layers:\n\u2022 Clearance level 1 is highest and will open raw data to observers, simulators and theorists. Since it can be\nmisinterpreted by non-experts, and since the preprocessed data will be separately available, the raw data will\nnot be open to non-researchers. The type of data available will include observations, simulations, theoretically\nmodeled.\n\u2022 Level 2 shall be for educators, k12 students, amateur astronomers etc. This will provide access to processed\ndata and catalogs and datasets/images derived from simulations and theory. The general public will not have\n6\n\n\fmuch use for such data.\n\u2022 Level 3 is for the general public and will provide the public outreach. This is the most restricted category. The\ngeneral public can get catalogs, pretty pictures and processed data but no access to simulations or to the raw\ndata.\nTopic Maps can play a vital role at both the input and output levels. At the input, TMs can be used to merge\ndifferent kinds of datasets including those from observers and simulators. Currently observers and simulators do not\nspeak identical languages in that their jargon differs (that is also true for observers using different wavelengths like\noptical and X-rays). To merge their dataproducts, we need to bring them on a common footing. Metadata can be\nused to define public names (topics) of columns that mean the same (using something like Column Descriptors used\nby CDS) for the two communities and will provide an easy way to combine the diverse databases into a derived\nproduct which could then be used on its own.\nAt the output, tailored TMs can be used to provide different views of the data holdings of the VO, automagically\nimplementing the different access levels for different type of users. The general public, to quote an example, will not\nhave to deal with data that they do not understand, nor will educators have to deal with raw data.\nVarious different tools will exist to deal with frequent and large, CPU consuming queries made by different types\nof users. Among the most frequent queries are going to be queries like the following:\n\u2022 Has object foo been observed and if so, how do I get to its data,\n\u2022 What information is available on topic footoo, and\n\u2022 How do I correlate catalog X with catalog Y with such-and-such restrictions.\nTopic maps provide an excellent mechanism to work in these areas. We see how in the next section.\n\n4. TOPIC MAPS FOR THE VIRTUAL OBSERVATORY\nIn Sect. 2 we saw the different components of a Topic Map. Here we sketch use scenarios for TMs using the common\nqueries mentioned in the previous section. Excerpts of a corresponding Topic Map are in the Appendix.\n\n4.1. Observation Logs\nConsider a database of observational logs. It will be an important component of the VO since it will tell us of available\nobservations for any object. The information pool here is formed by the logs of big surveys and those of various\nobservatories. For each observation obtained by individuals for different projects, some object will be the primary\ntarget. This will become the main topic for such observations. Various facets like telescope, observer, instrument\nand filter will get entered into the XML file. Another important factor is the size of field covered (in imaging mode,\nfor instance). Besides the obvious use of looking for objects that are the primary targets, Topic Maps, with the aid of\nappropriate catalogs, also assist the search for serendipitously observed objects. We could thus use the field around\na given object to search for other objects with certain criteria as given in the example below. When observations\nfor an object are present (regular or serendipitous), pointers to the location/source of the data will be returned.\nEach observatory can maintain its own logs but so long as they are XML-compliant, a single Topic Map will be able\nto work with all of them. Of course for different instruments different Topic Maps could be used to decrease the\nprocessing time. However, these different Topic Maps can then be merged whenever needed. All objects, observer\nnames, instruments, telescopes etc. will form separate topics. The associations between these will go into forming\nthe Topic Map. This will aid in asking exact questions like \"what spectroscopic observations of NGC 4261 have been\ndone at a 4m+ class telescope\".\nAnother example worth considering is of the following kind. Suppose one is looking for all cool stars for which\nspectra with the HST are available. Currently, no straight forward mechanism is available to do this. When the\ntwo databases are brought together, the natural tendency of the user is to query out cool stars from an appropriate\nstellar database first and then check which of those have HST spectra. A cheaper way would be to query the HST\ndatabase for stellar spectra and then check which of those are cool stars. With Topic Maps, this is how it can be\ndone: A Topic Map on the stellar database with stars as topics will have \"cool\" as a facet associated with the cool\n7\n\n\fstars. The HST database with spectra will similarly have the facet \"cool\" associated with spectra of cool stars. A\nmerging of the two TMs (using the names of stars for the merge parameter) and choosing those with the facet \"cool\"\nwill straightaway produce the desired listing.\nAn example of a more VO like search could be that of searching for QSO pairs. To do this one could use a Topic\nMap (with QSOs as primary targets) over an information pool consisting of observation logs. A merger of such a\nTopic Map with another that has color outliers as its topics (with the catalogs from the corresponding observations\nforming the information resource) could point to companion QSOs.\n\n4.2. Literature Database\nOriginally Topic Maps were thought of in order to be able to merge different indices, glossaries etc. Their use for\nmerging different literature databases to ease searches is analogous and hence immediately practical. The existing\ndatabases like ADS, arXiv.org and those from individual journals maintain a set of keywords and articles associated\nwith such keywords. If Topic Maps are used over such an information pool one can make use of occurrence roles\nmore effectively to get better results. When we search for \"dust lane galaxy\" in just the titles of papers, a lot of\nrelevant articles are missed. If the search is generalized to an occurrence in the abstract or text, far too many and\nlargely irrelevant answers are returned. In the later case, all different occurrence roles and types are being returned\nin a pot pouri. If only the keywords are stored as an XML file and a Topic Map with \"dust lane galaxy\" as a topic\nis overlaid, more appropriate results will get returned.\nFrom the abstracts, keywords and classifications associated with each document in a literature database, a large\nnumber of topics can be chosen to form a Topic Map. Additionally, each topic will have a number of facets associated\nwith it. Thus the Topic Map forms an additional layer of structure over the already existing one. This allows one to\nmaintain a view of the underlying knowledge without changing the structure underneath. Different Topic Maps i.e.\nthose with different sets of topics and associations provide different views of the same underlying knowledge making\nit easier to search the structure and to get to what one needs in a quick and precise way. In addition, browsing\nand exploring the underlying knowledge structure becomes easier for the users. However, for this to happen, proper\nTopic Maps need to be created with the help of information specialists working closely with astronomers.\n\n4.3. Federating Datasets\nVO will not only make science easier to do, but it will in fact enable several different scientific investigations that\nwould not be possible otherwise. One important component in the enabling nature is the federation of large datasets.\nThough currently all the mechanism is not in place, one of the grandest use of Topic Maps could be to provide\nknowledge organization of the very large-sized federated datasets. The access level to VO will determine the type\nof queries a user can run on different databases. One of the most important queries will involve cross-correlations\nbetween different datasets e.g. a sky-survey at optical wavelengths like DPOSS and another at radio wavelengths\nlike FIRST. Federating two such datasets will be the most basic step. It is easy if the two databases are of the\nsame type. An SQL query could access the necessary columns from the two and merge them into a single derived\ntable e.g. RA, Dec, rmag from DPOSS, and RA, Dec, S408 from FIRST. However, different sky survey archives tend\nto have different databases: relational, objectivity etc. making it nontrivial to extract information uniformly and\nmerge it meaningfully. Topic Maps can provide a mechanism that will make it possible. One could use the column\nnames in the databases as topics with all the synonyms as secondary names, and with wavelength, flux conversions\nincluded as associations (indeed, all kinds of conversions can exist as associations e.g. \"is-same-as\", \"is-analogousto\", \"is-identical-to\" etc.). However, as noted towards the end of Sect. 5, Topic Maps have not really been tested for\nscalability to the extreme scales and one may have to tread cautiously.\nScalable or not, TMs will still work with huge databases when it is the attributes rather than the objects that\nform the topics. Databases that contain billions of objects will still contain at most hundreds of attributes per object.\nA TM developed on the attributes will still be important.\nThe web-face of the databases would again be XML. Topic Maps could utilize the metadata associated with the\ninformation pool (database) to overlay complex structure in a systematic way to organize the knowledge therein.\nAgain, different Topic Maps would provide different views and hence structuring of the knowledge without actually\nmodifying the database.\n\n8\n\n\f5. CURRENT STATUS, FUTURE PROSPECTS, AND CONCLUSIONS\nThough Topic Maps started life as a standard for software documentation in 1991 (HyTime Hypertext 1991 conference\nin San Antonio) the progress has been slow. It is only when XML matured that their real potential has been noticed.\nIn 1996 Topic Maps became a work item in ISO's SGML working group resulting in a Topic Map standard published\nin 1999. Since then a number of commercial organizations have taken an interest in Topic Maps and progress is\nexpected to be brisk. More history can be found in [2].\nA lot still needs to be done and hence this article is still more of an outline than a report on a finished project:\n\u2022 The tool support needed is immense. There will have to be tools for Topic Map design, creation, merging,\nexchanging and overlaying. Each of these processes are big goals in themselves e.g. designing a consistent Topic\nMap needs careful definitions of different types and roles of topics, scopes have to be defined and associations\nand occurrences of different topics explicitly coded. A visualization tool is necessary to extend a Topic Map\nand to merge it with another one and even to check the different queries that could be made with one. Merging\nitself involves defining import/export methods and carefully designed topic naming constraints.\n\u2022 ISO/IEC 13250 has declared interchange format for Topic Maps. However, issues like transitivity and symmetry\n(see Sect. 2) are not part of the standard and browsers could presently include monopolized versions.\n\u2022 With multi-million node Topic Maps, powerful graphic interfaces will be needed for navigation. There will have\nto be slots for user-definable Topic Maps too.\n\u2022 Implementation issues like object model design and the storage and searching of TMs need careful consideration.\nWork is in progress on these fronts at different places. Currently the best way to keep oneself updated on these\nissues is by following the egroups on these topics, keeping an eye on the related web sites, and perhaps actually\ngetting involved. It is important for astronomers to participate especially in making sure that the functionality\ndrivers deliver.\nSome of the sites to look out for (and this is not an exhaustive list by any means) are given below.\n\u2022 http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/ has the latest version of TopicMaps.Org Specification (check also links\non that page).\n\u2022 http://www.ontopia.net/. Ontopia has tmproc [4] an implementation in Python.\n\u2022 http://www.mondeca.com/. Mondeca too has started supplying software components that are based on Topic\nMaps.\n\u2022 http://www.infoloom.com/. Infoloom and their tutorial at www.topicmaps.net. They also arrange conferences\non Topic Maps (http://www.gca.org) and have a good FAQ (http://www.infoloom.com/tmfaq.htm).\n\u2022 http://k42.empolis.co.uk/tmv.html. Topic Map View from Empolis.\n\u2022 http://www.techquila.com/tm4j.html. TM4J: A Topic Map engine for Java.\nSome questions that still need attention (see [5]):\n\u2022 Work on Knowledge Organization (KO) has been going on for years. How best to translate those KO structures\ninto meaningful TM syntax without reinventing the wheel.\n\u2022 We still do not know how scalable Topic Maps are with respect to layered semantic interoperability.\nThe work that we have currently undertaken is to build a set of Topic Maps for the 100 galaxies closest to\nour Galaxy. The information pool is formed by the data from NED on these objects (in XML format devised by\nCDS) and references from ADS. The work involves constructing Topic Maps from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist,\nastronomer, librarian, college student etc. and is still at an elementary stage. As progress is made, it will be posted\nat: http://www.astro.caltech.edu/\u223caam/science/topicmaps/.\n9\n\n\fTo summarize, Topic Maps are emerging as a new and powerful tool for knowledge organization in very large\ninformation resources. The concept behind Topic Maps is that of a topic being used to access information about\nit based on the underlying knowledge. The greatest advantage of Topic Maps is that they can be maintained\nindependent of any information resources they are combined with, thus making them information assets in their\nown right. Another advantage is that different Topic Maps provide different views of the same information resource\nand different Topic Maps can be merged and exchanged. This facilitates the generation of an overall structure for\nmultiple information resources without changing the resources themselves. Various attempts are underway to create\ntools necessary for Topic Map design, creation, maintenance and merging.\n\nAPPENDIX\nExcerpts from an Example Topic Map\n!
