As a steady\nstream of dry sand is poured onto a horizontal surface, a pile forms which has a thin river of sand on\none side flowing from the apex of the pile to the edge of its base. The river rotates about the pile,\ndepositing a new layer of sand with each revolution, thereby growing the pile. For small piles the\nriver is steady and the pile formed is smooth. For larger piles, the river becomes intermittent and\nthe surface of the pile becomes undulating. The frequency of revolution of the river is measured as\nthe pile grows and the results are explained with a simple scaling argument. The essential features\nof the system that produce the phenomena are discussed.\n\nSandpiles have received considerable interest because\nof their intrinsic scientific interest both from the fundamental and applied points of view, and also because\nthey are simple examples of complex systems whose behavior has been used in an attempt to explain a variety\nof physical, chemical, biological and social phenomena[1].\nConventional understanding of sandpile formation is that\nas grains of sand are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile develops which grows intermittently\nthrough avalanches that \"adjust\" the angle of repose\nof the pile about some critical value, or, at least, keep\nit between two critical values. This mechanism of\npile formation has been widely studied in the recent\nyears[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nHere we report experimental observation of a remarkable\nnew mechanism of pile formation.\nPouring a steady stream of sand into the center of a\ncylindrical container, as shown in Fig. 1, a pile formed.\nThen, a continuous river of sand developed flowing from\nthe apex of the pile to the inner boundary of the container. The river, which was narrow compared with the\nradius of the container, revolved around the pile depositing a helical layer of sand a few grains thick with each revolution. Thus, the pile grew as the river revolved around\nit. A photograph of a revolving river can be seen in\nFig. 2. Within a range of experimental parameters and\nconditions, the formation of a revolving river was easily\nreproducible, and very robust. Once formed, a typical\nriver persisted for dozens of full turns around the growing pile, and stopped only when forced to by interrupting\nthe pouring of sand.\nIn the experiments, a vertical glass tube with a 20 mm\ninner diameter was initially filled with sand using a funnel. Then a 4 mm hole was opened in the bottom of\nthe tube, allowing sand to fall out of the tube by its own\nweight. This arrangement produced a steady flow of sand\nout of the tube at a steady rate of 4.5 g/s for the duration\nof the experiment. Video cameras recorded both lateral\n\nand top views of the piles during the experiment. (Top\nviews were obtained with the help of a 45o tilted mirror).\nTwo different versions of the experiment were performed,\neach corresponding to a different boundary condition of\nthe growing pile. In the first version (described above),\nthe pile had a closed boundary. The sand was dropped at\nthe center of a cylindrical container, so that the radius\nof the resulting pile was constant in time. In the second\nversion, the pile had an open boundary. No container\nwas present. Instead, the sand fell onto a flat horizontal\nsurface and the radius of the pile increased in time.\nRivers that revolved about the pile in both clockwise\nand counterclockwise directions were observed. The direction chosen in a particular case depended on the initial conditions. The axial symmetry of the system was\ntherefore spontaneously broken as the river was formed.\nViewed from above, the rivers were slightly bent, and always revolved around the pile in the direction of their\nconcavity, as shown in Figs. 2a and 2c. A steady revolving river was typically observed when sand was poured\ninto a container with a 4-6 cm radius. In this case, the\nsurface of the pile was smooth. However, when a container with a radius larger than 6 cm was used, an instability appeared in the flow of the river. The revolving river still developed, growing the pile as before, but\nthe flow of the river was intermittent rather than continuous. In that case, the intermittent flow produced an\nundulating pattern on the pile surface, visible in Figs.\n2c and 2d. The undulating pattern resembles those recently observed for rapid granular flows on an inclined\nplane[18, 19], but presumably is caused by a different\nmechanism. The observed pattern was quite regular for\ncontainers with a radius just large enough to observe the\ninstability, but became more irregular as the size of the\ncontainer grew. If a container smaller than 3 cm radius\nwas used, stable revolving rivers were not observed.\nThe revolving river mechanism of pile formation has\nalso been observed by simply pouring the sand onto a\n\n\f2\nflat surface. In that case, the crossover from a continuously flowing revolving river, observed in smaller piles, to\nan intermittently flowing river, observed in larger piles,\noccurred as the radius of the pile reached about 6 cm.\nThe crossover appeared to be correspond to the pile size\nneeded for the length of the ballistic motion of the sand\ngrains in a river to begin to be damped.\nWe have varied the drop height in the experiment. For\ndrop heights between 1 cm and 7 cm the results closely\nfollow the description given above. However, for drop\nheights less than 1 cm or larger than 7 cm, stable rivers\nwere not observed.\nThe origin of the curved shape of a revolving river and\nthe reason for it moving in the direction of its concavity\ncan be understood by how a river forms. Based on careful\nobservation, revolving rivers appear to form through the\nfollowing scenario, illustrated in Fig. 3. Initially, sand is\npoured onto the top of a conical pile and it forms a river\nflowing straight down one side of the pile (Fig. 3a). Sand\nbegins to build up at the bottom of the river at the edge\nof the pile, forming a growing inverted V shaped delta\nof stationary sand (Fig. 3b). The delta grows in size\nuntil the river spontaneously chooses to begin to flow\ndown one of the sides of the delta (Fig. 3c). Once it\nchooses a side, it continues to flow down that side of the\ndelta, depositing sand all along the lower, delta side of the\nriver. As it does so, it rotates about the pile. For smaller\npiles, the process of rotation was stable. However, for\nlarger piles, it was not. Instead, in that case, a new delta\nwould intermittently begin to form at the bottom of the\nriver (Fig. 3d). When the delta reached sufficient height,\nthe river would \"jump\" forward in its rotation, and then\nbegin forming yet another new delta.\nIn order to begin to quantitatively understand the revolving rivers, we measured the time evolution of the angular velocity of river rotation with both closed and open\nboundaries. As shown in Fig. 4, the angular velocity of\nriver rotation was roughly constant for piles in cylindrical containers, while it decreased in time as t\u2212\u03b1 , with\n\u03b1 = 2/3, for open boundary conditions. These results\ncan be explained using the following scaling argument\nwhose geometrical hypotheses are illustrated in Fig. 5.\nAssume that a new layer of sand is uniformly deposited\non a conical pile of radius r with an angle of repose \u03b8c ,\nand that the volume of sand added per unit time is F .\nFor a system with a closed boundary, the thickness of an\nadded layer is proportional to \u03b4h (see Fig. 5a). Therefore, the volume of sand deposited in each rotation of the\nriver\nV =\n\n\u03c0 r2 \u03b4h\ncos \u03b8c\n\nis constant in time. The angular velocity of the river\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0\n\nF\nV\n\n(1)\n\nis therefore also constant in time. In our experiments, we\nmeasured \u03b4h = 2 mm, \u03c6c = 33o , and F = 0.35 cm3 /s .\nHowever, for a system with an open boundary the radius\nof pile grows in time. In this case, the thickness of each\nlayer is proportional to \u03b4r (see Fig. 5b). The volume of\nsand deposited in a rotation of the river is\nV = \u03c0 tan \u03b8c r2 \u03b4r\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r is a function of time, but \u03b4r = \u03b4h/ sin \u03b8c is constant. Thus, from this result and Eqn. 1, \u03c9 \u223c r\u22122 . The\npile radius increases at a rate of\ndr\n= \u03c9 \u03b4r\ndt\nIntegrating this expression, we get r \u223c t1/3 , and therefore\n\u03c9 \u223c t\u22122/3 .\nOur scaling argument matches well the experimental results shown in Fig. 4a. In the case of Fig. 4b, although\nthis argument correctly predicts the scaling of the experimental data for larger piles, it does not properly describe\nthe behavior of smaller piles, presumably due to the fact\nthat our geometrical assumptions are inaccurate near the\ntip of the pile.\nThe appearance of revolving rivers is quite sensitive to\nthe type of sand used in the experiments. In the results\nreported here, sand from Santa Teresa, Cuba, was used.\nIt consists in irregularly shaped grains of size 30\u2212250 \u03bcm\nmade of almost pure silicon oxide. It was also quite\ndry. Revolving rivers were still observed if the sand was\nmeshed to remove grains smaller than 90 \u03bcm and larger\nthan 160 \u03bcm. However, other sands from Cuba, USA,\nNorway and Tunisia were tried, including ones high in\nCalcium Carbonate, and ones high in Magnetite, but no\nrevolving rivers were observed within our experimental\nconditions (a river occasionally formed in those sands,\nbut it disappeared in fractions of a second). Revolving rivers also were not observed if glass beads having\nroughly the same size as the Santa Teresa sand were used.\nIt is therefore suspected that the effective coefficient of\nfriction between grains, and the mass density of grains\nmay be important factors determining if revolving rivers\nappear in the formation of piles. These elements must\nbe included in a future \"first principles\" model of the\nrevolving rivers.\nWe acknowledge E. Mart\u0131\u0301nez for cooperation in the experiments, and S. Douady, H.

Formation of a pile of sand by revolving rivers.\nThe sand is poured vertically on the center of cylindrical\ncontainers with flat, horizontal bottoms at a deposition\nrate of 0.35 cm3 /s, from a constant height of 1.5 cm above\nthe apex of the pile. (a) Top view of a pile growing into a\n5 cm radius container, where the continuous river can be\nidentified. (b) Lateral view of the pile shown in (a). (c)\nTop view of a pile growing into a 10 cm radius container\nwhere an intermittent river and the related pattern can\nbe identified. (d) Lateral view of the pile shown in (c)\n(the photo shows about 3 cm of the container's perimeter). In all cases, arrows indicate the revolving direction.\nFig. 3. Development of a revolving river. (a) A river\n\nflows straight down the side of the pile, and a delta begins\nto form at its bottom. (b) The delta continues to grow.\n(c) When the delta is sufficient size, the river begins to\nflow down one side and rotate around the pile. (d) If the\npile is sufficiently large, a new delta forms intermittently\nat the bottom of the river, causing the rotation of the\nriver to become intermittent.\n\nFig. 4. Time dependence of the angular speed of revolving rivers for (a) closed boundary conditions in the\ncontinuous regime(5 cm-radius container) and (b) open\nboundary conditions. The solid line in (b) has a slope of\n-2/3.\n\nFig. 5. Geometrical hypotheses of our scaling argumet\nfor (a) closed boundary conditions and (b) open boundary conditions.\n\n\fSand\nGlass tube\n50 cm\n1.1 cm\nExchangeable\ndelivering tip\n\nCylindrical\ncontainer\n(just for the closed\nboundary experiments)\n\nSandpile\n\n\fa\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n\fa\n\nb\nStraight river\n\nGrowing \"delta\"\n\nc\n\n\"Bent\" river\n\nd\n\nRevolving direction\n\nSaturated \"delta\"\nGrowing new \"delta\"\nNew \"delta\" begins here for larger piles\n\n\f\u03c9(turns/s)\n\n0.04\n\na\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.00\n\n\u03c9(turns/s)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n~t\n10\n\n600\n\n700\n\n-2/3\n\n-2\n\n100\n\nt(s)\n\n1000\n\n800\n\nb\n\n\fF\n\na\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03b4h\n\nr\n\nF\n\nb\n\n\u03c9(t)\n\n\u03b4r\n\nr(t)\n\n\f"}
