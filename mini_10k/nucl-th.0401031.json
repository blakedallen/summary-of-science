Finally, we discuss the emergence\nof density perturbations in a first-order phase transition and why they\nmight affect relative hadron multiplicities, collective flow, and hadron\nmean-free paths at decoupling. A minimum in the collective flow v2\nexcitation function was discovered experimentally at 40 A*GeV - such a\nbehavior has been predicted long ago as signature for a first order phase\ntransition.\n\nby DFG, BMBF, GSI\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe phase transition from partonic degrees of freedom (quarks and\ngluons) to interacting hadrons is a central topic of modern high-energy\nphysics. In order to understand the dynamics and relevant scales of\nthis transition laboratory experiments under controlled conditions are\npresently performed with ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Hadronic spectra and relative hadron abundancies from these experiments\nreflect important aspects of the dynamics in the hot and dense zone\nformed in the early phase of the reaction. Furthermore, as has been proposed early by Rafelski and M\u00fcller [1] the strangeness degree of freedom\nmight play an important role in distinguishing hadronic and partonic\ndynamics.\nIn fact, estimates based on the Bjorken formula [2] for the energy\ndensity achieved in central Au+Au collisions suggest that the critical\nenergy density for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is by\nfar exceeded during a few fm/c in the initial phase of the collision at\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energies [3], but sufficient energy\ndensities (\u223c 0.7-1 GeV/fm3 [4]) might already be achieved at Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) energies of \u223c 10 A*GeV [5, 6]. More\nrecently, lattice QCD calculations at finite temperature and quark chemical potential \u03bcq [7] show a rapid increase of the thermodynamic pressure\nP with temperature above the critical temperature Tc for a phase transition to the QGP. The crucial question is, however, at what bombarding\nenergies the conditions for the phase transition (or cross-over) might be\nfulfilled.\nPresently, transverse mass (or momentum) spectra of hadrons are in\nthe center of interest. It is experimentally observed that the transverse\nmass spectra of kaons at AGS and SPS energies show a substantial flattening or hardening in central Au+Au collisions relative to pp interactions (cf. Refs. [8, 9]). In order to quantify this effect, the spectra are\noften parametrised as:\nmT\n1 dN\n)\n\u223c exp(\u2212\nmT dmT\nT\nq\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mT = m2 + p2T is the transverse mass and T is the inverse slope\nparameter. This hardening of the spectra is commonly attributed to\nstrong collective flow, which is absent in the pp or pA data.\nThe authors of Refs. [10] have proposed to interpret the approximately constant K \u00b1 slopes above \u223c 30 A*GeV \u2013 the 'step' \u2013 as an\nindication for a phase transition following an early suggestion by Van\nHove [11]. This interpretation is also based on a rather sharp maximum\n\n\fReview of QGP signatures - ideas versus observables\n\n1\n\n3\n\nin the K + /\u03c0 + ratio at \u223c 20 to 30 A*GeV in central Au+Au (Pb+Pb)\ncollisions (the 'horn' [10]). However, it is presently not clear, if the\nstatistical model assumptions invoked in Refs. [10] hold to be reliable.\nWe will demonstrate in this contribution that the pressure needed to\ngenerate a large collective flow \u2013 to explain the hard slopes of the K \u00b1\nspectra as well as the 'horn' in the K + /\u03c0 + ratio \u2013 is not produced in the\npresent models by the interactions of hadrons in the expansion phase of\nthe hadronic fireball. In our studies we use two independent transport\nmodels that employ hadronic and string degrees of freedom, i.e., UrQMD\n(v. 1.3) [12, 13] and HSD [14, 15]. They take into account the formation\nand multiple rescattering of hadrons and thus dynamically describe the\ngeneration of pressure in the hadronic expansion phase. This involves\nalso interactions of 'leading' pre-hadrons that contain a valence quark\n(antiquark) from a 'hard' collision (cf. Refs. [14, 16]).\nThe UrQMD transport approach [12, 13] includes all baryonic resonances up to masses of 2 GeV as well as mesonic resonances up to 1.9\nGeV as tabulated by the Particle Data Group [17]. For hadronic continuum excitations a string model is used with hadron formation times in\nthe order of 1-2 fm/c depending on the momentum and energy of the created hadron. In the HSD approach nucleons, \u2206's, N\u2217 (1440), N\u2217 (1535),\n\u039b, \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 hyperons, \u039e's, \u039e\u2217 's and \u03a9's as well as their antiparticles\nare included on the baryonic side whereas the 0\u2212 and 1\u2212 octet states are\nincluded in the mesonic sector. High energy inelastic hadron-hadron collisions in HSD are described by the FRITIOF string model [18] whereas\nlow energy hadron-hadron collisions are modeled based on experimental cross sections. Both transport approaches reproduce the nucleonnucleon, meson-nucleon and meson-meson cross section data in a wide\nkinematic range. We point out, that no explicit parton-parton scattering\nprocesses (beyond the interactions of 'leading' quarks/diquarks) are included in the studies below contrary to the multi-phase transport model\n(AMPT) [19], which is currently employed from upper SPS to RHIC\nenergies.\n\n2.\n2.1\n\nHadron excitation functions and ratios\npp versus central AA reactions \u2013 the 'kink'\n\nIn order to explore the main physics from central AA reactions it is\ninstructive to have a look at the various particle multiplicities relative\nto scaled pp collisions as a function of bombarding energy. For this aim\nwe show in Fig. 1 the total multiplicities of \u03c0 + , K + and K \u2212 (i.e., the\n4\u03c0 yields) from central Au+Au (at AGS) or Pb+Pb (at SPS) collisions\n\n\f4\n800\n\n800\n\nMultiplicity\n\n+\n\n\u03c0\n\npp*350/2\nAA\n\n400\n\npp*350/2\nAA\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nK\n\n80\n\nMultiplicity\n\n+\n\n600\n\n600\n\n200\n\n+\n\nK\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n+\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n100\n\n60\n\n60\n\nK\n\n50\n\nMultiplicity\n\nHSD\n\nUrQMD\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\n\nK\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nFigure 1.\nTotal multiplicities of \u03c0 + , K + and\nK \u2212 (i.e., 4\u03c0 yields) from\ncentral Au+Au (at AGS)\nor Pb+Pb (at SPS) collisions in comparison to the\ntotal multiplicities from\npp collisions (scaled by a\nfactor 350/2) versus kinetic energy Elab .

The deviations between the\ntransport models and the data are most pronounced for the midrapidity\nratios (left column) since the ratios are very sensitive to actual rapidity\nspectra. The K + /\u03c0 + ratio in UrQMD shows a maximum at \u223c 8 A*GeV\nand then drops to a constant ratio of 0.11 at top SPS and RHIC energies.\nIn the case of HSD a continuously rising ratio with bombarding energy\nis found for the midrapidity ratios which partly is due to a dip in the\npion pseudo-rapidity distribution at RHIC energies (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref.\n[30]). The 4\u03c0 ratio in HSD is roughly constant from top SPS to RHIC\nenergies, however, larger than the ratio from UrQMD due to the lower\namount of pion production in HSD essentially due to an energy-density\ncut of 1 GeV/fm3 , which does not allow to form hadrons above this\ncritical energy density [16] and a slightly higher K + yield (cf. Fig. 2).\n\n\fReview of QGP signatures - ideas versus observables\n\n3\n\n7\n\nNevertheless, the experimental maximum in the K + /\u03c0 + ratio is missed,\nwhich we address dominantly to the excess of pions in the transport\ncodes rather than to missing strangeness production. Qualitatively, the\nsame arguments - due to strangeness conservation - also hold for the\n(\u039b + \u03a30 )/\u03c0 ratio, where the pronounced experimental maxima are underestimated due to the excess of pions in the transport models at top\nAGS energies (for HSD) and above \u223c 5 A*GeV (for UrQMD). Since the\nK \u2212 yields are well reproduced by both approaches (cf. Fig. 2) the deviations in the K \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212 ratios at SPS and RHIC energies in UrQMD can\nbe traced back to the excess of pions (see discussion above).\nWe stress that the maximum in the (\u039b + \u03a30 )/\u03c0 ratio is essentially due\nto a change from baryon to meson dominated dynamics with increasing bombarding energy. Similar arguments hold for the experimentally\nobserved maxima in the ratio \u039e/\u03c0 (cf. Ref. [32]). However, the 'horn'\nin the K + /\u03c0 + ratio at \u223c30 A*GeV is not described by neither of our\ntransport models.\n\n3.\n\nTransverse mass spectra \u2013 the 'step'\n\nWe now focus on transverse mass spectra of pions and kaons/antikaons\nfrom central Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions from 2 A*GeV to 21.3 A*TeV\nand compare to recent data (cf. Ref. [33]). Without explicit representation we mention that the agreement between the transport calculations\nand the data for pp and for central C+C and Si+Si is quite satisfactory [33]; no obvious traces of 'new' physics are visible. The situation,\nhowever, changes for central Au+Au (or Pb+Pb) collisions. Whereas\nat the lowest energy of 4 A*GeV the agreement between the transport\napproaches and the data is still acceptable, severe deviations are visible in the K \u00b1 spectra at SPS energies of 30 and 160 A*GeV [33]. We\nnote that the \u03c0 \u00b1 spectra are reasonably described at all energies while\nthe inverse slope T of the K \u00b1 transverse mass spectra in Eq. (1) is\nunderestimated severely by about the same amount in both transport\napproaches (within statistics). The increase of the inverse K \u00b1 slopes in\nheavy-ion collisions with respect to pp collisions, which is generated by\nrescatterings of produced hadrons in the transport models, is small because the elastic meson-baryon scattering is strongly forward peaked and\ntherefore gives little additional transverse momentum at midrapidity.\nThe question remains whether the underestimation of the K \u00b1 slopes\nin the transverse mass spectra [33] might be due to conventional hadronic\nmedium effects. In fact, the mT slopes of kaons and antikaons at SIS\nenergies (1.5 to 2 A*GeV) were found to differ significantly [34]. As\nargued in [15] the different slopes could be traced back to repulsive kaon-\n\n\f8\n\n+\n\n0.35\n\nAu+Au / Pb+Pb -> K +X\n\nT [GeV]\n\n0.30\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.20\n\n1\n\n0.35\n\n0\n\n10\n\nNA49\nSTAR\nPHENIX\n\n0.10\n\n100\n\u2212\n\nAu+Au / Pb+Pb -> K +X\n\n0.30\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.35\n\n\u2212\n\np+p -> K +X\n0.30\n\nHSD\nUrQMD\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n\u2212\n\n0\n\nexp. data:\nK;\nKS\nFRITIOF-7.02 in HSD\nUrQMD\n\n0.15\nE866\nNA44\nBRAHMS\n\n0.10\n\n+\n\nexp. data:\nK;\nKS\nFRITIOF-7.02 in HSD\nUrQMD\n\n0.15\nE866\nNA44\nBRAHMS\n\n0.10\n\n+\n\np+p -> K +X\n\n0.30\n\nHSD\nUrQMD\n\n0.15\n\nT [GeV]\n\n0.35\n\n1\n\n10\n\ns\n\n1/2\n\nNA49\nSTAR\nPHENIX\n\n100\n\n[GeV]\n\n0.10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\ns\n\n1/2\n\n[GeV]\n\nFigure 4.

[29].\n\nnucleon potentials, which lead to a hardening of the K + spectra, and\nattractive antikaon-nucleon potentials, which lead to a softening of the\nK \u2212 spectra. However, the effect of such potentials was calculated within\nHSD and found to be of minor importance at AGS and SPS energies\n[15] since the meson densities are comparable to or even larger than\nthe baryon densities at AGS energies and above. Additional self energy\ncontributions stem from K \u00b1 interactions with mesons; however, s-wave\nkaon-pion interactions are weak due to chiral symmetry arguments and\np-wave interactions such as \u03c0 + K \u2194 K \u2217 transitions are suppressed\nsubstantially by the approximately 'thermal' pion spectrum [35].\nFurthermore, we have pursued the idea of Refs. [36, 37] that the K \u00b1\nspectra could be hardened by string-string interactions, which increase\nthe effective string tension \u03c3 and thus the probability to produce mesons\nat high mT [19, 37]. In order to estimate the largest possible effect\nof string-string interactions we have assumed that for two overlapping\nstrings the string tension \u03c3 is increased by a factor of two, for three\noverlapping strings by a factor of three etc. Here the overlap of strings\nis defined geometrically assuming a transverse string radius Rs , which\naccording to the studies in Ref. [38] should be Rs \u2264 0.25 fm. Based on\nthese assumptions (and Rs =0.25 fm), we find only a small increase of the\ninverse slope parameters at AGS energies, where the string densities are\nlow. At 160 A*GeV the model gives a hardening of the spectra by about\n\n\fReview of QGP signatures - ideas versus observables\n\n4\n\n9\n\n15%, which, however, is still significantly less than the effect observed\nin the data.\nOur findings are summarized in Fig. 4, where\nthe dependence of the\n\u221a\ninverse slope parameter T (see Eq. (1)) on s is shown and compared\nto the experimental data [8, 39] for central Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions\n(l.h.s.) and pp reactions (r.h.s.). The upper and lower solid lines (with\nopen circles) on the l.h.s. in Fig. 4 correspond to results from HSD\ncalculations, where the upper and lower limits are due to fitting the\nslope T itself, an uncertainty in the repulsive K \u00b1 -pion potential or the\npossible effect of string overlaps. The slope parameters from pp collisions\n(r.h.s. in Fig. 4) are seen to increase smoothly with energy both in the\nexperiment (full squares) and in the HSD calculations (full lines with\nopen circles). The UrQMD results for pp collisions are shown as open\ntriangles connected by the solid line and systematically lower than the\nslopes from HSD at all energies.\nWe mention that the RQMD model [36] gives higher inverse slope\nparameters for kaons at AGS and SPS energies than HSD and UrQMD,\nwhich essentially might be traced back to the implementation of effective\nresonances with masses above 2 GeV as well as 'color ropes' which decay\nisotropically in their rest frame [42].

The solid lines\nare polynomial fits to\nthe data [44].\n\nThe NA49 Collaboration [44] has recently observed a vanishing elliptic flow of protons in Pb+Pb collisions at 40 A*GeV at midrapidity\nfor all centralities (Fig. 5). This observation of the apparent collapse\nof the collective flow v2 is remarkable because the proton elliptic flow\nv2 at top AGS (11 A*GeV) [43] and top SPS energies (160 A*GeV) [44]\n\n\f10\nis non-zero for mid-central collisions and large for peripheral collisions.\nThis experimental observation of a minimum of the collective flow excitation function has been predicted as a signature for a first order phase\ntransition [45].\n\n5.\n\nThermodynamics in the T \u2212 \u03bcB plane\n\nThis still leaves us with the question of the origin of the rapid increase\nof the K \u00b1 slopes with invariant energy for central Au+Au collisions\nat AGS energies and the constant slope at SPS energies (the 'step'),\nwhich is missed in both transport approaches. We recall that higher\ntransverse particle momenta either arise from repulsive self energies \u2013\nin mean-field dynamics \u2013 or from collisions, which reduce longitudinal\nmomenta in favor of transverse momenta [5, 46]. As shown above in Fig.\n4 conventional hadron self-energy effects and hadronic binary collisions\n\u00b1\nare insufficient\n\u221a to describe the dramatic increase of the K slopes as a\nfunction of s. This indicates additional mechanisms for the generation\nof the pressure that is observed experimentally.\nHere we propose that additional pre-hadronic/partonic degrees of freedom might be responsible for this effect already at \u223c 5 A*GeV. Our arguments are based on a comparison of the thermodynamic parameters T\nand \u03bcB extracted from the transport models in the central overlap regime\nof Au+Au collisions [48] with the experimental systematics on chemical\nfreeze-out configurations [47] in the T, \u03bcB plane. The solid line in Fig. 6\ncharacterizes the universal chemical freeze-out line from Cleymans et al.\n[47] whereas the full dots with errorbars denote the 'experimental' chemical freeze-out parameters - determined from the fits to the experimental\nyields - taken from Ref. [47]. The various symbols (in vertical sequence)\nstand for temperatures T and chemical potentials \u03bcB extracted from\nUrQMD transport calculations in central Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions at\n21.3 A*TeV, 160, 40 and 11 A*GeV [48] as a function of the reaction time\n(from top to bottom). The open symbols denote nonequilibrium configurations and correspond to T parameters extracted from the transverse\nmomentum distributions, whereas the full symbols denote configurations\nin approximate pressure equilibrium in longitudinal and transverse direction.\nDuring the nonequilibrium phase (open symbols) the transport calculations show much higher temperatures (or energy densities) than the\n'experimental' chemical freeze-out configurations at all bombarding energies (\u2265 11 A*GeV). These numbers are also higher than the tri-critical\nendpoints extracted from lattice QCD calculations by Karsch et al. [49]\n(large open circle) and Fodor and Katz [7] (star).

The stars indicate the tri-critical\nendpoints from lattice QCD calculations by Karsch et al. [49] (large open circle) and\nFodor and Katz [7] (star). The 'horizontal' line with errorbars is the phase boundary\n(from the endpoint) given in Ref. [7]. The 'vertical' lines indicate \u03bcB for different\nrapidity intervals at RHIC energies from Ref. [50].\n\nlattice calculations differ substantially in the value of \u03bcB for the critical\nendpoint, the critical temperature Tc is in the range of 160 MeV in both\ncalculations, while the energy density is in the order of 1 GeV/fm3 or\neven below. Nevertheless, this diagram shows that at RHIC energies one\nencounters more likely a cross-over between the different phases when\nstepping down in temperature during the expansion phase of the 'hot\nfireball'. This situation changes at lower SPS or AGS (as well as new GSI\nSIS-300) energies, where for sufficiently large chemical potentials \u03bcB the\ncross over should change to a first order transition [51], i.e., beyond the\ntri-critical point in the (T, \u03bcB ) plane. Nevertheless, Fig. 6 demonstrates\nthat the transport calculations show temperatures (energy densities) well\nabove the phase boundary (horizontal line with errorbars) in the very\n\n\f12\nearly phase of the collisions, where hadronic interactions practically yield\nno pressure, but pre-hadronic degrees of freedom should do. This argument is in line with the studies on elliptic flow at RHIC energies, that\nis underestimated by 30% at midrapidity in the HSD approach for all\ncentralities [30]. Only strong early stage pre-hadronic interactions might\ncure this problem.\nIn Fig. 6 we also show the baryon chemical potential \u03bcB for different\nrapidity intervals at RHIC energies as obtained from a statistical model\nanalysis by the BRAHMS Collaboration based on measured the antihadron to hadron yield ratios [50]. For midrapidity, \u03bcB \u2243 0, whereas for\nforward rapidities \u03bcB increases up to \u03bcB \u2243 130 MeV at y = 3. Thus,\nthe forward rapidity measurement allows to probe large \u03bcB at the same\nbombarding energies. Hence, at RHIC only a rather limited chemical\npotential range is accessible experimentally. To reach the probable first\norder phase transition region, the International Facility at GSI seems to\nbe the right place to go.\n\n6.\n\nDensity perturbations from dynamical\nsymmetry breaking\n\nIt is of great interest, of course, to investigate whether the abovementioned observations could be due to a phase transition of strongly\ninteracting matter. The natural effective theory for exploring the effects\nfrom phase transitions on the production and phase-space distribution\nof hadrons is hydrodynamics: the equation of state enters directly by\nclosing the system of continuity equations for energy, momentum and\ncharge conservation. Typically, first-order phase transitions are modelled by matching the pressure of the low-density massive (symmetry\nbroken) phase to that of the high-density massless (symmetric) phase\nalong a 'phase boundary' in the T \u2212 \u03bcB plane (cf. Fig. 6). On the phase\ntransition line, the system is in a mixed state where both phases coexist\nand where their relative fractions are determined from Gibbs's conditions\nof phase equilibrium. This construction assumes that the phase transition is a quasi-static, reversible process (entropy is conserved) near\nequilibrium. Entropy is produced only in the initial compression stage\nwhich ends with the formation of a locally equilibrated fireball of hot\nand dense matter which subsequently expands and cools.\nThe crossover from suppressed to increased pion production in central\nnuclear collisions relative to scaled pp collisions reflects the excess entropy produced at higher energies [52], as also seen in Fig. 1. Somewhat\nsurprisingly though, the excitation function of entropy production turns\nout to be rather smooth, without exhibiting 'discontinuities' from cross-\n\n\fReview of QGP signatures - ideas versus observables\n\n6\n\n13\n\ning the phase boundary at some energy. Aside from some dynamical\neffects, the main reason for this behavior is that in baryon-rich matter the specific entropy is a smooth function of temperature without a\npronounced 'jump' [52].\nSince the entropy produced right at impact (on a time scale of order\n2RA /\u03b3 in the CM frame) increases smoothly with energy, all hadron\nabundance ratios will behave correspondingly and the sharp 'horn' in\nK + /\u03c0 + seen in the data can not be reproduced. This holds for typical hydro models with a first-order phase transition [52] as well as for\nhadronic transport models (see discussion above).\nIf early-stage entropy poduction can not account for the sharp peak of\nK + /\u03c0 + ratio then perhaps the phase transition back to the broken phase\n(which occurs later on after some cooling) can ? This might be possible indeed if one abandons the equilibrium phase transition based on\nthe macroscopic Gibbs construction and, in turn, introduces a dynamical microscopic treatment of phase transitions into hydrodynamics. It\nis well-known that first-order phase transitions lead to inhomogeneities\nsuch as high-density 'nuggets', surrounded by low-density 'voids'. Analogous effects are frequently discussed within the context of the QCD\ntransition in the early universe, where inhomogeneities of the entropy\n(or baryon to photon ratio) might affect BBN. The usual mixed-phase\nconstruction applies on scales much larger than the size and separation\nof inhomogeneities, and on such scales the matter and entropy distributions appear smooth. On small scales however, for example in heavy-ion\ncollisions, inhomogeneous density distributions have significant effects on\nobservables which are non-linear functions of the density: take a large\nhomogeneous system, split it in half, and move all baryons into one half,\nthen let each half equilibrate. Suppose you can not measure the hadron\nmultiplicities in each half separately, just the total. The obvious measurement, namely of baryon number, doesn't reflect the presence of the\nhigh-density nugget because the total baryon number is the same as for\nthe homogeneous distribution. However, the total yield of K + over the\ntotal yield of \u03c0 + will be larger than for the homogeneous system ! This\nis because the ratio is enhanced in the high-density nugget by a much\nbigger factor than it is suppressed in the low-density half of the system.\n(Other hadrons like (multi-)strange baryons of course compensate the\nstrangeness and are also more abundant than for the homogeneous system.) The effect diminishes rapidly when the entropy per (net) baryon\nbecomes large, that is, in the meson-dominated high-energy regime. To\ninvestigate the formation of inhomogeneities during the phase transition\nwe solve for the coupled evolution of an order parameter field such as\n\n\f14\ng = 5.5\n16\n\n5\n\n14\n4\n\n12\n\nt [fm/c]\n\n10\n\n3\n\n8\n2\n\n6\n4\n\n1\n\nFigure 7.\nSpace-time evolution of the fluid energy\ndensity along the x-axis at\ny = z = 0. The scale on\nthe right specifies the energy density in units of nuclear matter density \u01eb0 \u2243 150\nMeV/fm3 .\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\nx [fm]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n7\n\nthe chiral condensate \u03c6 and the thermalized matter fields [53]:\n\u03c6 + \u2202Veff /\u2202\u03c6 = 0,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2202\u03bc Tfl\u03bc\u03bd + T\u03c6\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nHere, Tfl\u03bc\u03bd is the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid, T\u03c6\u03bc\u03bd that of the\nclassical modes of the chiral condensate, and Veff is the effective potential obtained by integrating out the thermalized degrees of freedom.\nWe focus first on energy-density inhomogeneities and present solutions\nof these coupled equations for vanishing baryon density [53]. As initial condition we chose a homogeneous energy density above the critical\nenergy density for the transition to the broken phase. However, the condensate \u03c6 exhibits 'primordial' Gaussian fluctuations on length scales\n\u223c 1 fm on top of a smoothly varying mean field. These fluctuations are\nthen propagated through a first-order chiral phase transition and leave a\nrather inhomogeneous (energy-) density distribution in the wake of the\ntransition, as seen in Fig. 7. Evidently, the scale for such fluctuations is\nnot tiny and so it would not be appropriate to assume a homogeneous\ndensity distribution. On the other hand, they are too small to be resolved in rapidity space because the scale factor is large at times long\nafter the initial impact. To resolve individual hot/dense spots would\nrequire a resolution better than one unit of rapidity, which is roughly\nequal to the thermal width of the local particle momentum distributions.\nHowever, additional hints for the existence of large density inhomogeneities created in the course of the transition to the broken phase\nremain to be explored. (Inhomogeneities from fluctuations of particle\nproduction in the primary nucleon-nucleon collisions should be largely\nwashed out until decoupling by hydrodynamic transport of matter due\nto pressure gradients, see e.g. [54].) Clearly, the yields of other hadron\n\n\fReview of QGP signatures - ideas versus observables\n\n7\n\n15\n\nspecies depend non-linearly on the density as well, and their behavior\nhas to be tested for consistency. Moreover, coordinate-space fluctuations\nof the energy-momentum tensor of matter produced by a phase transition are uncorrelated to the reaction plane and therefore should act\nto reduce out-of-plane collective flow (v2 /hpt i) as compared to equilibrium hydrodynamics, cf. the discussion in [53]. Finally, Hanbury-Brown\u2013\nTwiss correlations could provide valuable coordinate-space information\non the regions from which particles are emitted. In this regard, note\nthe stunning result of CERES [55] according to which pions decouple\nwhen their mean-free path is \u223c 1 fm. This is inconceivable in standard\nequilibrium hydrodynamics without density perturbations because there\nparticles decouple only when their mean-free path exceeds the scale of\nspatial homogeneity, which is about an order of magnitude larger [56].\nThe CERES analysis indicates that density (and perhaps velocity) gradients in coordinate space are 1/1 fm rather than 1/10 fm.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nSummarizing this contribution, we point out that baryon stopping\n[57] and hadron production in central Au+Au (or Pb+Pb) collisions\nis quite well described in the independent transport approaches HSD\nand UrQMD. Also the 'longitudinal' rapidity distributions of protons,\npions, kaons, antikaons and hyperons are similar in both models and in\nreasonable agreement with available data. The exception are the pion\nrapidity spectra at the highest AGS energy and lower SPS energies,\nwhich are overestimated by both models [16]. As a consequence the\nHSD and UrQMD transport approaches underestimate the experimental\nmaximum of the K + /\u03c0 + ratio ('horn') at \u223c 20 to 30 A*GeV. However,\nwe point out that the maxima in the K + /\u03c0 + and (\u039b + \u03a30 )/\u03c0 ratios\npartly reflect a change from baryon to meson dominated dynamics with\nincreasing bombarding energy.\nWe have found that the inverse slope parameters T for K \u00b1 mesons\nfrom the HSD and UrQMD transport models are practically independent of system size from pp up to central Pb+Pb collisions and show\nonly a slight increase with collision energy, but no 'step' in the K \u00b1\ntransverse momentum slopes. The rapid increase of the inverse slope\nparameters of kaons for collisions of heavy nuclei (Au+Au) found experimentally in the AGS energy range, however, is not reproduced by\nneither model (see Fig. 4). Since the pion transverse mass spectra \u2013\nwhich are hardly effected by collective flow \u2013 are described sufficiently\nwell at all bombarding energies [29], the failure has to be attributed to\na lack of pressure. This additional pressure should be generated in the\n\n\f16\nearly phase of the collision, where the 'transverse' energy densities in the\ntransport approaches are higher than the critical energy densities for a\nphase transition (or cross-over) to the QGP. The interesting finding of\nour analysis is, that pre-hadronic degrees of freedom might already play\na substantial role in central Au+Au collisions at AGS energies above\n\u223c 5 A*GeV. The more astonishing is the experimentally observed collapse of the collective flow v2 at 40 A*GeV - such a behavior has been\npredicted as signature for a first order phase transition long ago.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
