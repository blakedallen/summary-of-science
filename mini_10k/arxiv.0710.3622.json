Introduction\nStudy of hypernuclei is one of the frontiers in nuclear physics. The strange degree of freedom\ngives a new dimension to the description of nuclear structure. A hyperon (or a strange quark) embedded in nuclei plays a characteristic role as an \"impurity\" or a probe in the many body system[1].\nModern nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials give a successful description of the NN scattering\ndata and have been used to make precise calculations of light nuclei[2, 3]. In contrast, hyperonnucleon (Y N) and hyperon-hyperon (YY ) interactions have large uncertainties, because the scattering experiments are either difficult or impossible due to the short life-time of hyperons. The\nfull phase shift analysis at the same level of the NN case is not available yet. Although a lot of\ntheoretical models which describe Y N interaction together with the NN interaction have been published, the different model predicts different phase shifts and scattering parameters, e.g., of the \u039bN\npotential in spite of the nice description of the NN sector[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ?].\nRecently, a lattice QCD study of the NN potential has been performed[10]. This approach may\nlead to a new paradigm to study the Y N and YY interactions too, since the lattice QCD is an ab\ninitio method of treating the fundamental theory of strong interaction. (See also the conventional\napproach to the Y N phase shifts using the L\u00fcscher's finite volume formula[11].)\nThe purpose of the present report is to explore the Y N and YY potentials from the lattice QCD\nsimulation on the basis of the methodology developed in Refs. [10, 12]. The extension from the NN\npotential to Y N and YY potentials is relatively straightforward. In the case of the NN potential, there\nare only two representations in the isospin channel, i.e., 2 \u2297 2 = 3 \u2295 1 in SU (2), which correspond\nto isovector and isoscalar channels. Including the strange degrees of freedom extends the arithmetic\ninto flavor SU (3), 8\u2297 8 = 27 \u2295 10 \u2295 1\u2295 8\u2295 10 \u2295 8. Here the isovector (isoscalar) channel of the NN\nsector is assigned to be a subset in the 27-plet (10-plet) representation. The potentials for newly\narising channels are hardly determined from the real experiment so far. The lattice QCD simulation\nwith physical strange quark mass provides new numerical \"data\" for these strange channels.\nIn this report, we focus on the N\u039e potential in the isovector (I = 1) channel as a first step.\nWe keep away, at present, from the isoscalar (I = 0) channel of the N\u039e potential, since it is not\nthe lowest state of the isoscalar 1 S0 channel and \u039b\u039b strong decay mode may open below the N\u039e.\nThere are almost no experimental information on the N\u039e interaction, although a few experimental\ndata[13, 14, 15] suggest that the \u039e-nucleus potential would be weakly attractive. Moreover, the\n\u039e-nucleus interaction will be studied as a day one experiment in the near future at J-PARC[16]\nthrough (K \u2212 , K + ) reaction on the nuclear target such as 12 C.\n\n2. Formulation\nAs we mentioned, the methodology to obtain the potential is along the lines of Refs. [12]\nand [10]. The latter describes, successfully for the first time, the NN potentials from lattice QCD\nsimulation. We start from an effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation for N\u039e system at low energies:\n\u2212\n\n1 2\n\u2207 \u03c6 (~r) +\n2\u03bc\n\nZ\n\nd 3 r\u2032U (~r,~r\u2032 )\u03c6 (~r\u2032 ) = E \u03c6 (~r),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03bc = mN m\u039e /(mN + m\u039e ) and E are the reduced mass of the N\u039e system and the nonrelativistic\nenergy in the center-of-mass frame, respectively. The nonlocal potential can be represented by the\n2\n\n\fHyperon-nucleon potentials from lattice QCD\n\nHidekatsu Nemura\n\nderivative expansion as\nU (~r,~r\u2032 ) = VN\u039e (~r, \u2207)\u03b4 (~r \u2212~r\u2032 ).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe general expression of the potential VN\u039e would be\nVN\u039e = V0 (r) +V\u03c3 (r)(~\u03c3N * ~\u03c3\u039e ) +V\u03c4 (r)(~\u03c4N *~\u03c4\u039e ) +V\u03c3 \u03c4 (r)(~\u03c3N * ~\u03c3\u039e )(~\u03c4N *~\u03c4\u039e )\n+VT (r)S12 +VT \u03c4 (r)S12 (~\u03c4N *~\u03c4\u039e ) +VLS (r)(~L * ~S+ ) +VLS\u03c4 (r)(~L * ~S+ )(~\u03c4N *~\u03c4\u039e )\n+VALS (r)(~L * ~S\u2212 ) +VALS\u03c4 (r)(~L * ~S\u2212 )(~\u03c4N *~\u03c4\u039e ) + O(\u22072 ).\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere S12 = 3(~\u03c31 *~n)(~\u03c32 *~n) \u2212 ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32 is the tensor operator with ~n =~r/|~r|, ~S\u00b1 = (~\u03c31 \u00b1 ~\u03c32 )/2 symmetric (+) and antisymmetric (\u2212) spin operators, ~L = \u2212i~r \u00d7 ~\u2207 the relative angular momentum\noperator, and ~\u03c4N (~\u03c4\u039e ) is isospin operator for N (\u039e). We note that the antisymmetric spin-orbit\nforces (VALS and VALS\u03c4 ) newly come up because the constituents (N and \u039e) are not identical.\nAccording to the above expansion of the potential, the wave function should be classified by\nthe total isospin I, the total angular momentum and parity J \u03c0 with J~ = ~L + ~S+ . Particular spin\n(isospin) projection can be made in terms of ~\u03c3N * ~\u03c3\u039e (~\u03c4N * ~\u03c4\u039e ), e.g., for the isospin projection we\nhave P(I=0) = (1 \u2212 ~\u03c4N * ~\u03c4\u039e )/4 and P(I=1) = (3 + ~\u03c4N * ~\u03c4\u039e )/4. In this work, we focus only the isospin\nI = 1, S-wave component of the wave function, so as to obtain the (effective) central potential\nthrough\n1 ~\u22072 \u03c6 (r)\n.\n(2.4)\nVcentral (r) = E +\n2\u03bc \u03c6 (r)\nThe S-wave wave function is measured from the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter (BS) amplitude\n\u03c6 (~r; k) as\n\n\u03c6 (~r; k) =\n\nE\nD\n1\n1\n\u03c3\n0\n0\nP\np\np\u039e\n;\nk\n,\n0\n(R[~\nr]\n+~\nx)\u039e\n(~\nx)\n\u03b1\n\u2211\n\u2211\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n24 R\u2208O L3 ~x\n\n(2.5)\n\np\u03b1 (x) = \u03b5abc (ua (x)C\u03b35 db (x)) uc\u03b1 (x),\n\n(2.6)\n\n= \u03b5abc (ua (y)C\u03b35 sb (y)) sc\u03b2 (y),\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u039e0\u03b2 (y)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the Dirac indices, a, b and c the color indices, and C = \u03b34 \u03b32 the charge\nconjugation matrix. The summation over R \u2208 O is taken for cubic transformation group to project\nonto the S-wave, and the summation over ~x for zero total spatial momentum. p\u03b1 (x) and \u039e0\u03b2 (y) are\nthe local field operators for the proton and \u039e0 . We take the upper components of the Dirac indices\n\u03c3 = (\u03c3 )\n\u03c3\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 to construct the spin singlet (triplet) channel by P\u03b1\u03b2\n2 \u03b1\u03b2 (P\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03c31 )\u03b1\u03b2 ).\nThe \u03c6 (~r) with ~r = ~x \u2212~y is understood as the probability amplitude to find \"nucleon-like\"\nthree quarks located at point ~x and \"\u039e-like\" three quarks located at point ~y. The \u03c6 (~r) includes not\nonly the elastic amplitude N\u039e \u2192 N\u039e but also the inelastic amplitudes such as N\u039e \u2192 \u03c0 N\u039e and\nN\u039e \u2192 \u039b\u03a3, and so on. Note that, at low energies below the thresholds, however, the asymptotic\nbehavior of \u03c6 (~r) is not affected by the inelastic contributions, since they decrease exponentially in\nthe asymptotic region. (In the present calculation with the isospin I = 1, the \u039b\u039b channel is closed\ndue to the isospin conservation.) On the other hand, \u03c6 (~r) and hence the potential may depend on\nthe interpolating fields in the interaction region. Further study on this issue is found in Ref.[17] for\nthe NN potential.\n3\n\n\fHyperon-nucleon potentials from lattice QCD\n\nHidekatsu Nemura\n\nIn the actual simulations, the BS amplitude is obtained through the four-point correlator,\nD\nE\nFp\u039e0 (~x,~y,t;t0 ) = 0 p\u03b1 (~x,t)\u039e\u03b20 (~y,t)J p\u039e0 (t0 ) 0\n(2.8)\nE\nD\n(2.9)\n= \u2211 An 0 p\u03b1 (~x)\u039e0\u03b2 (~y) n e\u2212En (t\u2212t0 ) .\nn\n\nHere J p\u039e0 (t0 ) is a source term located at t = t0 .

The interpolating fields for \u039b and \u03a3+ , employed in\nthis work, are given by\n\u039b\u03b1 (x) = \u03b5abc {(da (x)C\u03b35 sb (x)) uc\u03b1 (x) + (sa (x)C\u03b35 ub (x)) dc\u03b1 (x) \u2212 2 (ua (x)C\u03b35 db (x)) sc\u03b1 (x)} ,\n(2.10)\n+\n(2.11)\n\u03a3\u03b2 (y) = \u2212\u03b5abc (ua (y)C\u03b35 sb (y)) uc\u03b2 (y).\n\n3. Numerical calculation\nWe use the standard Wilson gauge action at the gauge coupling \u03b2 = 5.7 on the 323 \u00d7 32\nlattice together with the standard Wilson quark action. See Ref.[17] for details. The hopping\nparameter of \u03baud = 0.1678 is chosen for the u and d quarks, which corresponds to m\u03c0 \u2243 0.37 GeV,\nm\u03c1 \u2243 0.81 GeV, and mN \u2243 1.16 GeV. In order to determine the parameter for the strange quark mass\n(\u03bas ), we first measure the correlators of pseudo scalar and vector mesons by using the interpolating\nfields given by\nMps (x) = q1,c\u03b1 (x)\u03b35,\u03b1\u03b2 q2,c\u03b2 (x)\n\nfor pseudo scalar meson,\n\n(3.1)\n\nMv,k (x) = q1,c\u03b1 (x)\u03b3k,\u03b1\u03b2 q2,c\u03b2 (x)\n\nfor vector meson,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith applying six set of hopping parameters; first three sets for \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 (\u03c0 and \u03c1 mesons) with taking a number from {0.1678, 0.1665, 0.1640}, and another three sets for \u03ba1 > \u03ba2 (K and K \u2217 mesons)\nwith taking different two numbers from {0.1678, 0.1665, 0.1640}. Assuming the following functional forms for the pseudo scalar meson mass squared and for the vector meson mass,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\n1\nB 1\nB 1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n,\n(3.3)\n(m ps a)2 =\n2 \u03ba1 \u03bac\n2 \u03ba2 \u03bac\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nD 1\n1\n1\nD 1\n(mv a) = C +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n,\n(3.4)\n2 \u03ba1 \u03bac\n2 \u03ba2 \u03bac\nwe obtained critical hopping parameter \u03bac = 0.1693, and the physical parameter, \u03ba phys = 0.1691,\nfrom (m\u03c0 a/m\u03c1 a) = (135/770). The lattice scale is determined so as to be a = 0.1420 fm from the\nphysical \u03c1 meson mass. The parameter for the strange quark mass is determined as \u03bas = 0.1643\nfrom the physical K meson mass (494 MeV).\n4\n\n\fHyperon-nucleon potentials from lattice QCD\n\nHidekatsu Nemura\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\nS0\nS1\n\n3\n\n1.0\n0.9\n\nt\u2212t0=6\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nr (fm)\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFigure 1: The radial wave function of p\u039e0 , in 1 S0 (circle) and 3 S1 (triangle) channels, obtained from the\nlattice QCD at t \u2212 t0 = 6.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\nTable 1 lists the hadron masses measured from the present lattice QCD simulation. 1283 gauge\nconfigurations are used to calculate the hadron masses and wave functions. (17 exceptional configurations are not used out of totally 1300 gauge configurations.) We note that the present results for\nthe baryon masses provide the correct order of particular threshold energy of two baryon states in\nthe strangeness S = \u22122 sector; Eth (\u039b\u039b) = 2525(11)MeV (this channel is not allowed in the present\ncase because of isospin conservation), Eth (N\u039e) = 2544(12)MeV, Eth (\u039b\u03a3) = 2575(11)MeV, and\nEth (\u03a3\u03a3) = 2624(11)MeV. This warrants the desirable asymptotic behavior of the wave function.\nFigure 1 shows the wave function obtained at the time slice t \u2212 t0 = 6. The 1 S0 (3 S1 ) channel\nis plotted by circles (triangles), which are normalized at the spatial boundary ~r = (32/2, 0, 0). All\nthe data are taken into account for r <\n\u223c 0.7 fm, while only the data on the x-, y-, and z-axis and\ntheir nearest neighbors are used to plot for the outer region. As seen in the Figure, the wave\nfunctions are suppressed in the short distance region, and a slight enhancement is found in the\nmedium range region for both 1 S0 and 3 S1 channels. There is sizable difference between the 1 S0 and\n3 S , particularly of suppression in the short distance, suggesting that the 1 S channel has stronger\n1\n0\nrepulsive core.\nm\u03c0\n367(1)\n\nm\u03c1\n811(4)\n\nmK\n552.6(5)\n\nmK \u2217\n882(2)\n\nmp\n1164(7)\n\nm \u039e0\n1379(6)\n\nm\u039b\n1263(6)\n\nm\u03a3+\n1312(6)\n\nTable 1: Hadron masses, given in units of MeV, measured from the lattice QCD simulation.

The inset shows its enlargement.\n\nFigure 2 shows the (effective) central potentials for p\u039e0 in the 1 S0 and 3 S1 channels. These\nresults are still preliminary, since the potentials are obtained by assuming E = 0: The energy should\nbe determined by fitting the asymptotic behavior of the wave function with the use of the Green's\nfunction G(~r, E) which is a solution of the Helmholtz equation on the lattice[12, 18]. Preliminary\ncalculation suggests that E would be small negative values for both 1 S0 and 3 S1 channels, similar\nto the case of the NN potential[10, 19].\nIn order to see the ground state saturation of the present results, we plot, in Fig. 3, the time-slice\ndependence of the potential in both of the 1 S0 (left-hand-side) and 3 S1 (right-hand-side) channels\nat several radial distances; r = 0.14, 0.20, 0.71, 1.42, and 2.27 fm. We can see that the saturation\nis achieved for t \u2212 t0 \u2265 6 within errors.\nThe present work is a first step toward the Y N and YY potentials from the lattice QCD simulation. Systematic studies of the various channels such as \u039bN, \u03a3N, \u039b\u039b, and so on are all interesting\nand important because they are intimately related not only to the structure of hypernuclei but also\nto the internal structure of neutron stars. We will present such studies in the near future.\n\nAcknowledgments\nLattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation has been done with IBM Blue Gene/L computer at KEK.\nH.
