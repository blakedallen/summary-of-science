Whereas some steps\ntoward finding all possible solutions to the perfect fluid constraint in the absence of a specific equation of state were\npresented in work early of Wyman and Hojman et al [4, 5], explicit and fully general solutions of the perfect fluid\nconstraint have only very recently been developed [6, 7]. In this article we present a variant of Lake's algorithm [7]\nusing curvature coordinates wherein:\n\u2022 We re-cast the algorithm in terms of variables with a clear physical meaning - the average density and the \"gravity profile\", a quantity closely related to both the gravitational redshift and the locally measured acceleration\ndue to gravity.\n\u2022 We minimize the number of differentiations and integrations by several judicious applications of integration by\nparts.\n\u2022 We present explicit, compact, and fully general formulae for the mass profile and pressure profile of an arbitrary\nfluid sphere.\n\u2022 We present an explicit, compact, and general formula for the central pressure of an arbitrary fluid sphere.\n\u2022 We compare and contrast the relativistic formulae we obtain with the much simpler Newtonian situation.\nWe emphasise that one of the virtues of this type of approach is that one is not fixed a priori to dealing with a\npre-specified equation of state [6] - in many interesting physical situations the equation of state is either uncertain\nor, because the fluid in question might be inhomogeneous, it may not even make sense to assign a single equation of\nstate to the entire fluid sphere.\nTo further illustrate the formalism we show how it may be used as the basis for a partial classification scheme\n- there is a free parameter in the algorithm that can take simple solutions into more complicated ones. Once this\nis appreciated it becomes easy to see (simply by parameter counting) that certain simple solutions must have oneparameter generalizations. Conversely, this observation explains why so many of the earliest discovered exact solutions\nhave one-parameter extensions.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: matt.visser@vuw.ac.nz; URL: http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~visser\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nFRAMEWORK\n\nTo set the stage, consider a static spherically symmetric geometry. It is a standard result that without loss of\ngenerality we can choose coordinates to write the metric in the form\n\u0014 Z \u221e\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndr2\n2\n(1)\n+ r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 .\nds = \u2212 exp \u22122\ng(r\u0303) dr\u0303 dt2 +\n1 \u2212 2m(r)/r\nr\nHere g(r) \"gravity profile\". It is related to the gravitational redshift by\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015\n1 + z = exp\ng(r\u0303)dr\u0303 ,\n\n(2)\n\nr\n\nand is related to the locally measured acceleration due to gravity by\nr\n2m(r)\na = 1\u2212\ng(r).\nr\n\n(3)\n\nOur convention is that g(r) is positive for a downward acceleration. The function m(r) is the quasi-local mass.\nIn the vacuum region beyond the surface (if any) of the star-like object, the Schwarzschild solution yields g(r) =\n(M/r2 )/(1 \u2212 2M/r) and m(r) = M . We find it more convenient to write the metric in the form\n\u0014 Z \u221e\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndr2\n2\nds = \u2212 exp \u22122\ng(r\u0303) dr\u0303 dt2 +\n(4)\n+ r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62\n2\n1\n\u2212\n2\u03bc(r)\nr\nr\nwhere \u03bc(r) =\nequations are\n\n4\u03c0\n3 \u03c1\u0304(r)\n\nis proportional to the average density inside radius r.

If on the other hand we take this same\nequation and rearrange it algebraically to extract d\u03bc/dr we find\n2r (g 2 + g \u2032 )\n(g/r)\u2032 + g 2 /r\nd\u03bc\n=\u2212\n\u03bc+\n.\ndr\n1+r g\n1+r g\n\n(10)\n\nBut this is a simple first-order linear ODE and hence explicitly solvable. A symbolic manipulation program such as\nMaple, or a slightly tedious hand-computation, easily yields the general solution\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015 \u001a\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\u001b\nZ\nr [g 2 (r) + g \u2032 (r)]\n\u2212g(r) + rg \u2032 (r) + rg(r)2\nr [g 2 (r) + g \u2032 (r)]\n\u03bc(r) = exp \u22122\ndr\nexp +2\ndr . (11)\nC1 +\n1 + rg(r)\nr2 [1 + rg(r)]\n1 + rg(r)\n\n\f3\nThis statement is equivalent to the algorithm presented by Lake [7]: Given a prescribed gravity profile g(r) (the\n\"generating function\"), and the knowledge that we are dealing with a perfect fluid, the mass profile m(r) = \u03bc(r) r3\nis deduced in closed form. The algorithm (11) is also equivalent to that presented by Rahman and Visser [6], after a\nchange of coordinates (from isotropic to curvature coordinates) and a change of variables. A particularly nice feature\nof the present version of the algorithm is that the generating function g(r) has a clear physical interpretation in terms\nof the gravitational field. Now the above is by no means the most useful form in which \u03bc(r) can be presented. An\nintegration by parts permits us to simplify the appearance of the integrating factor\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z\n1 \u2212 r g(r)\nr [g 2 (r) + g \u2032 (r)]\ndr = [1 + r g(r)]2 exp \u22122 g(r)\ndr .\n(12)\nexp +2\n1 + rg(r)\n1 + r g(r)\nIt is now extremely useful to introduce the notation\nZ\n1 \u2212 r g(r)\n\u03b8(r) = g(r)\ndr;\nand\n1 + r g(r)\n\n\u03b8(r1 ; r2 ) =\n\nZ\n\nr2\n\nr1\n\ng(r)\n\n1 \u2212 r g(r)\ndr.\n1 + r g(r)\n\n(13)\n\nWe warn the reader that we cannot generally assume r g(r) \u2264 1, and the consequently \u03b8 may become negative. For\ninstance, in the physically reasonable regime m(r)/r > 1/3 [that is, \u03bc(r) r2 > 1/3] and p \u2265 0, it can be shown from\nthe Gr\u0302r\u0302 Einstein equation that r g(r) > 1. All that we can safely say in general is that as long as local gravity points\ndown we must have\nZ\nZ\n\u2212 g(r) dr < \u03b8 < g(r) dr.\n(14)\nWith this notation\nexp[+2\u03b8(r)]\n\u03bc(r) =\n[1 + r g(r)]2\n\n\u001a\n\nC2 +\n\nZ\n\n\u001b\n[\u2212g(r) + rg \u2032 (r) + rg(r)2 ]\n[1 + r g(r)]\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r)] dr .\nr2\n\nA second integration by parts now yields\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1 + r g(r)\n1\nexp[+2\u03b8(r)]\n2 exp[\u22122\u03b8(r)]\nC\n+\n+\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r)]\ndr\n.\n\u03bc(r) =\n[1\n+\nr\ng(r)]\n3\n[1 + r g(r)]2\n2\nr2\nr3\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nIn this version of the result we have eliminated all the derivatives of g(r). A third integration by parts, using\n1/r3 = \u2212 21 (1/r2 )\u2032 then leads to\ng(r) [1 + 21 r g(r)] exp[+2\u03b8(r)]\n+\n\u03bc(r) =\nr [1 + r g(r)]2\n[1 + r g(r)]2\n\n\u001a\n\nC4 + 2\n\nZ\n\n\u001b\ng(r)2\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r)] dr .\nr[1 + r g(r)]\n\n(17)\n\nThis final version, as we shall soon see, has nice behaviour at the origin. Again, we emphasise that this is the explicit,\nand most general, solution to the perfect fluid constraint for arbitrary generating function g(r). All perfect fluid\nspheres, no matter how derived, must satisfy this equation.\nThe pressure can now be determined using the Gr\u0302r\u0302 Einstein equation so that\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u001b\u0015\nZ\n1\ng(r)2\n2\np(r) =\n\u2212g(r)\n\u2212\n2[1\n+\n2r\ng(r)]\nexp[+2\u03b8(r)]\nC\n+\n2\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r)]\ndr\n.\n(18)\n4\n8\u03c0[1 + r g(r)]2\nr[1 + r g(r)]\nThis now provides for us the explicit and fully general solution to the mass profile and pressure profile, given only\nthe gravity profile and the information that we are dealing with a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid.

There are three natural locations to work with:\n(1) the center of the fluid body, (2) the surface of the fluid body [assuming it has a well defined surface], and (3)\nspatial infinity. Perhaps surprisingly, the simplest results are obtained if we normalize at spatial infinity.\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT SPATIAL INFINITY\n\nWe will now adopt the very mild condition that the total mass of the fluid sphere is finite, so that \u03bc(r) \u2192 0 as one\napproaches spatial infinity. We also assume p(r) \u2192 0 at spatial infinity. Then (from the Gr\u0302r\u0302 equation) we deduce\ng(r) \u2192 0 at spatial infinity. Physically this means that the present discussion is capable of handling situations with\na tenuous atmosphere extending all the way to infinity, and that the special case where the fluid body has a sharp\nsurface with p(r \u2265 R) = 0 and m(r \u2265 R) = M is automatically included. Then fixing boundary conditions at spatial\ninfinity, the mass profile (17) is given by\nZ \u221e\ng(r) [1 + 12 r g(r)]\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r; \u221e)]\ng(r\u0303)2\n\u03bc(r) =\n\u2212\n2\nexp[+2\u03b8(r\u0303; \u221e)] dr\u0303.\n(20)\n2\n2\nr [1 + r g(r)]\n[1 + r g(r)]\nr\u0303[1 + r\u0303 g(r\u0303)]\nr\nWe can simplify this slightly to yield\n\u03bc(r) =\n\n2\ng(r) [1 + 12 r g(r)]\n\u2212\n2\nr [1 + r g(r)]\n[1 + r g(r)]2\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n\u221e\n\ng(r\u0303)2\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r; r\u0303)] dr\u0303.\nr\u0303[1 + r\u0303 g(r\u0303)]\n\nThe pressure profile determined from (18) is then\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n1\ng(r\u0303)2\n2\np(r) =\n\u2212g(r) + 4[1 + 2r g(r)]\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(r; r\u0303)] dr\u0303 .\n8\u03c0[1 + r g(r)]2\nr\u0303[1 + r\u0303 g(r\u0303)]\nr\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nFor the central pressure, pc = p(0), we find\npc\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ng(r)2\nexp[\u2212\u03b8(0; r)] dr.\nr[1 + r g(r)]\n\nCompare with the equivalent statement for a Newtonian fluid body in which the pressure profile is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\ng(r\u0303)2\n1\n2\n\u2212g(r) + 4\ndr\u0303 ,\np(r) =\n8\u03c0\nr\u0303\nr\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nand the central pressure is\npc =\n\nV.\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ng(r)2\ndr.\nr\n\n(25)\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE CENTER OF THE FLUID SPHERE\n\nIf we apply boundary conditions at the center of the sphere then, using\nm(r) + 4\u03c0p(r)r3\nr2 [1 \u2212 2m(r)/r]\n\n(26)\n\n4\u03c0\n(\u03c1c + 3pc )r + O(r2 ).\n3\n\n(27)\n\ng(r) =\nand the assumed finiteness of \u03c1c and pc , implies\ng(r) =\nThe mass and pressure profiles are given by\n\ng(r) [1 + 21 r g(r)] exp[+2\u03b8(0; r)]\n\u03bc(r) =\n+\nr [1 + r g(r)]2\n[1 + r g(r)]2\n\n\u001a\nZ\n\u22124\u03c0pc + 2\n\n0\n\nr\n\n\u001b\ng(r\u0303)2\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(0; r\u0303)] dr\u0303 ,\nr\u0303[1 + r\u0303 g(r\u0303)]\n\n(28)\n\nand\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u001b\u0015\nZ r\ng(r\u0303)2\n1\n2\n\u2212g(r) + [1 + 2r g(r)] exp[+2\u03b8(0; r; )] 8\u03c0 pc \u2212 4\np(r) =\nexp[\u22122\u03b8(0; r\u0303)] dr\u0303 ,\n8\u03c0[1 + r g(r)]2\n0 r\u0303[1 + r\u0303 g(r\u0303)]\n(29)\nto be compared with the Newtonian result\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ r\ng(r\u0303)2\n1\n2\ng(r) + 4\ndr\u0303 .\n(30)\np(r) = pc \u2212\n8\u03c0\nr\u0303\n0\n\n\f5\nVI.\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE SURFACE OF THE FLUID SPHERE\n\nIf the fluid sphere has a sharp boundary, (say at radius R, with the density and pressure identically zero outside\nthis radius), then it canp\nbe useful to normalize at this surface.

While the general algorithm presented above always provides an exact solution, it may not be an \"elementary\"\nsolution in the sense that the integrations might not be do-able in terms of either elementary or special functions. In\nsuch a situation, a simplified algorithm is sometimes useful.\nSuppose that one has found, by some unspecified means, a specific exact solution for a perfect fluid sphere. Let\nthat exact solution be given in terms of m(r) [or equivalently \u03bc(r)] and g(r). Then for any arbitrary constant k,\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\nr [g 2 (r) + g \u2032 (r)]\n\u03bc(r) \u2192 \u03bc(r) + k exp \u22122\ndr\n(35)\n1 + rg(r)\nis also an exact solution for a perfect fluid sphere [with the same g(r)]. This construction may sometimes \"fail\" in the\nsense that the integral is either too trivial [returning you to the seed solution you started with], or too complicated to\nperform in terms of elementary or special functions. However in very many cases this simple construction is sufficient\nto understand why certain broad classes of exact solution exist.\nLet us start by rescaling the time variable to remove any redundancies in the number of free parameters, n,\nappearing in gtt . If the number of free parameters appearing in grr is not at least n + 1 then the seed solution you\nhave must have a generalization. For instance the Minkowski solution [a particularly simple fluid sphere with zero\npressure and density] has exactly zero parameters appearing in both gtt and grr , and so must have a one-parameter\ngeneralization. In this case, performing the integration leads to the Einstein static universe. Similarly, the exterior\nSchwarzschild solution [another particularly simple fluid sphere with zero pressure and density] has exactly one free\nparameter [the mass] appearing in both gtt and grr , and so must have a one-parameter generalization. In this case,\nperforming the integration leads to what is called the Kuch68 II solution in the Delgaty\u2013Lake classification [8]. A\nslightly more complex example, using anti-de Sitter space as a seed, leads to the Tolman IV solution. A number of\nadditional examples of this phenomena are collected in table I.\nOf course, sometimes explicit exact solutions were first discovered in their general form, in which case this algorithm\nprovides no extra information. (This comment applies, for instance to the Wyman IIb geometry.) Conversely,\nsometimes the integral is too complicated to provide a closed-form solution - the generalization my be exact but\ntoo complex to write down explicitly. (As for instance when you use the Schwarzschild\u2013de Sitter [Kottler] geometry\n\n\f6\nSeed\nGeneralization\nMinkowski\nEinstein static\nSchwarzschild exterior Kuch68 II\nanti-de Sitter\nTolman IV\nTolman V\nKuch2 I\nTolman VI\nWyman IIa\nKuch1 Ib\nappears new\nM\u2013W III\nappears new\nK\u2013O III\nappears new\nTABLE I: Table I: Seed solutions and their generalizations.\n\nas seed. Similarly, by parameter counting Tolman VII and Tolman VIII must have one-parameter extensions, but it\nseems impossible to write then down in closed form.)\nFinally, we point out that there are some cases where this formalism does lead to apparently new solutions. (We\nagain follow the Delgaty\u2013Lake classification [8].) For instance, the Kuch1 Ib solution\nds2 = \u2212(A r + B r ln r)2 dt2 +\n\ndr2\n+ r2 d\u03a92\n2\n\n(36)\n\ngeneralizes to\nds2 = (A r + B r ln r)2 dt2 +\n\n2(2A + 2B ln(r) + B)\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a92\n(2A + 2B ln(r) + B) \u2212 kr2\n\nwhich appears to be new. Similarly, the M\u2013W III solution, which can be cast into the form,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n7dr2\nr2\n2\ndt2 +\nds = \u2212 r \u2212\n+ r2 d\u03a92\na\n4(1 \u2212 r2 /a2 )\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\ngeneralizes to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr2\ndr2\nds = r \u2212\ndt2 +\n+ r2 d\u03a92\na\n1 \u2212 2m(r)/r\n2\n\n(39)\n\nwith\nm(r) =\n\n4r2 + 3a2\n(r \u2212 a)r10/3\nr\n+\nk\n14a2\n(4r \u2212 3a)4/3\n\n(40)\n\nwhich also appears to be new. Also, the K\u2013O III solution can be cast into the form\n\u0012\n\u00132\nr2\nds = \u2212 1 + 2\ndt2 + dr2 + r2 d\u03a92\na\n2\n\n(41)\n\nwhich is spatially flat. It generalizes to\n\u00132\n\u0012\ndr2\nr2\ndt2 +\n+ r2 d\u03a92 ,\nds = \u2212 1 + 2\na\n1 \u2212 kr2 (3r2 + a2 )\u22122/3\n2\n\n(42)\n\nwhich is contained within the new class of exact solutions briefly described by Lake [7].\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs emphasised in the article by Rahman and Visser [6], and reiterated by Lake [7], while this type of algorithm\nguarantees a perfect fluid body it does not necessarily guarantee a \"physically reasonable\" perfect fluid body. One\nphysically reasonable constraint that is easy to enforce in the current formulation is g > 0; locally measured gravity\nshould always attract towards the center of the body. A second physically reasonable constraint which is automatically\n\n\f7\nsatisfied is that the central pressure is positive. It is considerably more difficult to enforce m(r) \u2265 0, \u03c1(r) \u2265 0, and\np(r) \u2265 0. Checking these physically motivated constraints amounts to mathematically investigating a set of integral\ninequalities, and seems to require a case by case investigation depending on the assumed gravity profile g(r). One\nshould not however lose track of the significance of what has been accomplished:\n\u2022 We have derived the exact and fully general solution to the pressure isotropy condition in terms of variables\nthat have a direct physical meaning, the gravity profile g(r) and mass profile m(r).\n\u2022 We have also derived an exact and fully general formula for the pressure profile p(r) of a perfect fluid sphere\nthat depends only on the gravity profile g(r).\n\u2022 In particular we have an exact and fully general expression for the central pressure of a fluid sphere, again\ndetermined directly in terms of the gravity profile g(r).\n\u2022 The algorithm provides a natural framework for understanding the reason for the existence of certain broad\nclasses of exact solution, and in some cases leads to new exact solutions.\nBecause this algorithmic approach works directly in terms of physically meaningful quantities, with a physically\nmeaningful \"generating function\" in the form of the gravity profile g(r), the interpretation of the results is somewhat\nclearer than in the algorithms presented in the Rahman\u2013Visser [6] and Lake [7] articles. We expect that this version\nof the algorithm for generating perfect fluid spheres will lead to additional useful \"exact solutions\". In particular, the\nnew class of exact solutions briefly described in [7] has a very natural representation in terms of this algorithm.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis Research was supported by the Marsden Fund administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.\n\n[1] S.
