The model is one of the most studied many-particle quantum problems, yet\nexcept in one dimension it has no exact solution, so that there remain many open questions about\nits properties.

It can be experimentally realized with unprecedented precision in\nsystems of ultra-cold fermionic atoms on an optical lattice of variable geometry. For the square and cubic lattices\none may expect very detailed experimental results over a wide range of parameters to be available1 . For instance,\nrecently systems of ultra-cold fermionic atoms describing the Mott-Hubbard insulating phase of the the Hubbard\nmodel on a cubic lattice were studied2 . On the one dimensional and square lattices the model has been widely used\nfor describing the effects of correlations in several types of materials such as quasi-one-dimensional conductors3,4 and\nhigh-Tc superconductors5\u20137 .\nUnfortunately, most exact results and well-controlled approximations for this model exist only in one dimension\n(1D)8\u201310 . Many open questions about its properties remain unsolved. One of the few exact results, which refers to the\nmodel on any bipartite lattice, is that for on-site interaction U 6= 0 it contains a global SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2\nsymmetry. It is associated with a spin SU (2) symmetry and a charge \u03b7-spin SU (2) symmetry11 . We denote the \u03b7-spin\n(and spin) value of the energy eigenstates by S\u03b7 (and Ss ) and the corresponding projection by S\u03b7z = \u2212[NaD \u2212 N ]/2\n(and Ssz = \u2212[N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 ]/2). Here NaD denotes the number of lattice sites and N = N\u2191 + N\u2193 that of electrons. Our\nnotation NaD is particularly appropriate to a D-dimensional cubic lattice where D = 1, 2, 3, ... for the one-dimensional,\nsquare, cubic ... lattice, respectively, Na is the number of sites in an edge of length L = Na a, and a is the spacing.\nIn this paper we find that for U 6= 0 the local SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge symmetry of the Hubbard model on\na bipartite lattice with transfer integral t = 012 can be lifted to a global [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z22 = SO(3) \u00d7\nSO(3) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry for the model with t > 0. Indeed, the requirement of commutability with the U/4t 6= 0\ninteracting Hamiltonian replaces the U = 0 global O(4)/Z2 = [SO(4) \u00d7 Z2 ]/Z2 symmetry by SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) =\n[SO(4) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z2 rather than SO(4). Here, the factor Z2 in SO(4) \u00d7 Z2 refers to the particle-hole transformation\non a single spin under which the interacting term is not invariant12 . In O(4)/Z2 and [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z22 =\nSO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) the factors 1/Z2 and 1/Z22 impose that [S\u03b7 + Ss ] and [S\u03b7 + Ss + Sc ], respectively, are integers.\nIn the latter equations Sc is the eigenvalue of the generator of the new global U (1) symmetry found in this paper.\nOur results profit from those of Ref.13 and reveal that such a symmetry becomes explicit, provided that one describes\nthe problem in terms of rotated electrons. Those are generated by any of the unitary transformations considered in\nthat reference, which refer to U/4t > 0 values and can be trivially extended to U/4t 6= 0 values. The global symmetry\n\n\f2\nfound here refers to the latter U/4t range.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The model and the electron - rotated-electron unitary transformations are the\nsubjects of Section II. In Section III a global SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry is established for the Hubbard model\non a bipartite lattice with U/4t 6= 0. Finally, Section IV contains the concluding remarks.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND A SET USEFUL ELECTRON - ROTATED-ELECTRON UNITARY\nTRANSFORMATIONS\n\nOn a bipartite lattice with spacing a, NaD \u2261 [Na ]D sites, Na even, Na /2 odd, L = Na a, and spatial dimension\nD < Na the Hubbard model is given by,\nD\n\nX\nU\n\u0124 = T\u0302 + [NaD \u2212 Q\u0302] ; T\u0302 = \u2212t\n2\n\nX\n\n[c~r\u2020j \u03c3 c~rj\u2032 \u03c3\n\n+ h.c.] ; Q\u0302 =\n\nNa\nX\nX\n\nn\u0302~rj \u03c3 (1 \u2212 n\u0302~rj \u2212\u03c3 ) .\n\n(1)\n\nj=1 \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\nh~\nrj ~\nrj\u2032 i \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\nHere T\u0302 is the kinetic-energy operator with first-neighbor transfer integral t, which can be expressed in terms of the\noperators,\nX X\nT\u03020 = \u2212\n[n\u0302~rj ,\u2212\u03c3 c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 c~rj\u2032 ,\u03c3 n\u0302~rj\u2032 ,\u2212\u03c3 + (1 \u2212 n\u0302~rj ,\u2212\u03c3 ) c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 c~rj\u2032 ,\u03c3 (1 \u2212 n\u0302~rj\u2032 ,\u2212\u03c3 ) + h.c.] ,\nh~\nrj ~\nrj \u2032 i \u03c3\n\nT\u0302+1 = \u2212\n\nX X\n\nn\u0302~rj ,\u2212\u03c3 c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 c~rj\u2032 ,\u03c3 (1 \u2212 n\u0302~rj\u2032 ,\u2212\u03c3 ) ,\n\nX X\n\n(1 \u2212 n\u0302~rj ,\u2212\u03c3 ) c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 c~rj\u2032 ,\u03c3 n\u0302~rj\u2032 ,\u2212\u03c3 ,\n\nh~\nrj ~\nrj \u2032 i \u03c3\n\nT\u0302\u22121 = \u2212\n\n(2)\n\nh~\nrj ~\nrj \u2032 i \u03c3\n\nas T\u0302 = t [T\u03020 + T\u0302+1 + T\u0302\u22121 ]. While the operator T\u03020 does not change electron double occupancy, the operators T\u0302+1 and\nT\u0302\u22121 do it by +1 and \u22121, respectively. In the above equations n\u0302~rj ,\u03c3 = c~r\u2020j \u03c3 c~rj \u03c3 , \u00b1\u03c3 refer to opposite spin projections,\nand the operator Q\u0302 counts the number of electron singly occupied sites.

Moreover, N\u0302 = \u03c3 N\u0302\u03c3 and N\u0302\u03c3 = j=1\nD\n\nFor simplicity let us consider that U/4t > 0 and let {|\u03a8\u221e i} be a complete set of 4Na energy eigenstates for U/4t \u2192\n\u221e. There is exactly one unitary operator V\u0302 = V\u0302 (U/4t) such that for the value of U/4t > 0 under consideration each\nD\nof the 4Na states |\u03a8U/4t i = V\u0302 \u2020 |\u03a8\u221e i is generated from the electronic vacuum by the same occupancy configurations\nof rotated electrons of creation operator c\u0303~r\u2020j \u03c3 as the corresponding U/4t \u2192 \u221e energy eigenstate in terms of electrons.\nThe rotated-electron creation and annihilation operators are given by,\nc\u0303~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 V\u0302 ;\n\nc\u0303~rj ,\u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 c~rj ,\u03c3 V\u0302 ;\n\n\u00f1~rj ,\u03c3 = c\u0303~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 c\u0303~rj ,\u03c3 .\n\n(4)\n\nRotated-electron single and double occupancy are good quantum numbers for U/4t > 0 whereas for electrons such\noccupancies become good quantum numbers only for U/4t \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, V\u0302 = V\u0302 (U/4t) becomes the unit operator\nin that limit. The unitary transformation associated with the operator V\u0302 is of the type studied in Ref.13 . There is one\nof such transformations for each choice of U/4t \u2192 \u221e energy eigenstates. Similar results are obtained for U/4t < 0.\nWe introduce the operator \u00d5 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u00d4 V\u0302 . It has the same expression in terms of rotated-electron creation and\nannihilation operators as \u00d4 in terms of electron creation and annihilation operators. Here V\u0302 = \u1e7c . Note that within\nour representation both the notations referring to marks placed over letters being a caret \u0174 or a tilde L\u0303 denote\noperators. Such notations are useful for operators for which W = L such as the general operators \u00d4 and \u00d5. Indeed,\nthen they imply the equivalent relations \u00d5 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u00d4 V\u0302 and \u00d4 = \u1e7c \u00d5 \u1e7c \u2020 . (Here we have used that V\u0302 = \u1e7c .) When\n\u00d4 6= \u00d5 our convention is that in general the expression of the operator \u00d4 in terms of electron creation and annihilation\noperators is simpler than that of \u00d5 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u00d4 V\u0302 in terms such operators. This then implies that the expression of \u00d5\nin terms of rotated-electron creation and annihilation operators is simpler than that of \u00d4 = \u1e7c \u00d5 \u1e7c \u2020 in terms of the\n\n\f3\nsame rotated-electron operators. (An exception are the electron operators of Eq. (4), which denote by c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 and c~rj ,\u03c3\nrather than by \u0109~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 and \u0109~rj ,\u03c3 , respectively.)\nAny operator \u00d4 can be written as,\n\u00d4 = V\u0302 \u00d5 V\u0302 \u2020 = \u00d5 + [\u00d5, \u015c ] +\n\n1\n1\n[[\u00d5, \u015c ], \u015c ] + ... = \u1e7c \u00d5 \u1e7c \u2020 = \u00d5 + [\u00d5, S\u0303 ] + [[\u00d5, S\u0303 ], S\u0303 ] + ... ,\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V\u0302 \u2020 = e\u015c , V\u0302 = e\u2212\u015c , and \u015c = S\u0303. That \u015c and V\u0302 have the same expression both in terms of electron and\nrotated-electron creation and annihilation operators justifies that \u00d4 = V\u0302 \u00d5 V\u0302 \u2020 = \u1e7c \u00d5 \u1e7c \u2020 in Eq. (5). Importantly, it\nfollows from the results of Ref.13 that for each electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation and corresponding\nunitary operator V\u0302 of the type considered in that reference the operator \u015c has a uniquely defined expression. For\nany of such transformations that unknown expression of \u015c involves only the kinetic operators T\u03020 , T\u0302+1 , and T\u0302\u22121 of Eq.\n(2) and numerical U/4t dependent coefficients. For U/4t 6= 0 it can be expanded in a series of t/U . Importantly, the\ncorresponding first-order term has a universal form for all electron - rotated-electron unitary transformations of the\nabove-mentioned type, which reads13 ,\ni\ni\nt h\nt h\n(6)\n\u015c = \u2212\nT\u0302+1 \u2212 T\u0302\u22121 + O(t2 /U 2 ) = S\u0303 = \u2212\nT\u0303+1 \u2212 T\u0303\u22121 + O(t2 /U 2 ) .\nU\nU\n\n(The form of our relation V\u0302 \u2020 = e\u015c justifies the extra minus sign in the \u015c and S\u0303 expressions given here, relative to\nthose of Ref.13 .)\nFurthermore, for any unitary operator V\u0302 of the above type, \u2212\u015c can be written as \u2212\u015c = \u015c(\u221e) + \u2206\u015c. Here \u015c(\u221e)\ncorresponds to the operator S(l) for l = \u221e defined in Eq. (61) of Ref.13 and \u2206\u015c has the general form provided in Eq.\n(64) of that reference. For each specific transformation and corresponding choice of U/4t \u2192 \u221e energy eigenstates there\nis exactly one choice for the numbers D(k) (m) in that equation. (k = 1, 2, ... refers to the number of rotated-electron\ndoubly occupied sites.)\nSince V\u0302 is unitary, the operators c\u0303~r\u2020j \u03c3 and c\u0303~rj \u03c3 have the same anticommutation relations as c~r\u2020j \u03c3 and c~rj \u03c3 . The\nPNaD\nn\u0302~rj ,\u03c3 equals the corresponding \u03c3 rotated-electron number operator \u00d1\u03c3 =\n\u03c3 electron number operator N\u0302\u03c3 = j=1\nPNaD\nrj ,\u03c3 . As a result, it remains invariant under V\u0302 , so that [N\u0302\u03c3 , V\u0302 ] = [N\u0302\u03c3 , \u015c] = 0. (See equation (5) such that\nj=1 \u00f1~\n[\u00d1\u03c3 , \u015c] = 0 for \u00d4 = N\u0302\u03c3 and \u00d5 = \u00d1\u03c3 .)\nIII.\nA.\n\nTHE GLOBAL SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) SYMMETRY FOR U/4t 6= 0\n\nGlobal symmetry of the Hubbard model on a general bipartite lattice\n\nThe local SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge symmetry of the Hamiltonian (1) for U/4t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e considered in Ref.12\nbecomes for finite |U/4t| > 0 values a group of permissible unitary transformations. It is such that the corresponding\nlocal U (1) canonical transformation is not the ordinary U (1) gauge subgroup of electromagnetism. Instead it is a\n\"nonlinear\" transformation12. Following the unitary character of V\u0302 = \u1e7c , one can either consider that,\n\u0124 = V\u0302 H\u0303 V\u0302 \u2020 = \u1e7c H\u0303 \u1e7c \u2020 = H\u0303 + [H\u0303, S\u0303 ] +\n\n1\n[[H\u0303, S\u0303 ], S\u0303 ] + ... ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nis the Hubbard model written in terms of rotated-electron operators or another Hamiltonian with an involved expression and whose operators c\u0303~r\u2020j \u03c3 and c\u0303~rj \u03c3 refer to electrons. According to Ref.13 , the latter rotated Hamiltonian is built\nup by use of the conservation of singly occupancy 2Sc = hQ\u0303i by eliminating terms in the t > 0 Hubbard Hamiltonian.\nThat is done so that Sc is an eigenvalue of the following one-half rotated-electron singly-occupancy number operator\nassociated with the operator \u015cc \u2261 Q\u0302/2,\nD\n\nNa\nX\n1\n1X\n1\n\u00f1~rj \u03c3 (1 \u2212 \u00f1~rj \u2212\u03c3 ) .\nS\u0303c \u2261 V\u0302 \u2020 Q\u0302 V\u0302 = Q\u0303 =\n2\n2\n2 j=1\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\nHere \u00f1~rj ,\u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 n\u0302~rj ,\u03c3 V\u0302 = c\u0303~r\u2020j \u03c3 c\u0303~rj \u03c3 is the operator given in Eq. (4). According to the studies of Ref.13 , this can be\ndone to all orders of t/U provided that U/4t 6= 0. In the context of Ref.14 , this is equivalent to compute rotated\n\"quasicharge\" fermions whose number exactly equals [NaD \u2212 2Sc ].\n\n\f4\nThe \"rotated\" Hamiltonian H\u0303 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u0124 V\u0302 commutes with the six generators of the SO(4) symmetry. Thus the\nHubbard model \u0124 commutes with both such generators and corresponding six other operators with the same expressions when written in terms of rotated-electron operators. Consistently with Eq. (5), this just means that the six\ngenerators of the \u03b7-spin and spin algebras commute with V\u0302 . To reach this result we have profited from the expression\nof the operator \u015c only involving the three kinetic operators given in Eq. (2). We have then calculated the following\ncommutators,\n[\u015c\u03b1z , T\u0302l ] = [\u015c\u03b1\u2020 , T\u0302l ] = [\u015c\u03b1 , T\u0302l ] = 0 ; \u03b1 = \u03b7, s , l = 0, \u00b11 .\n\n(9)\n\nAlthough the algebra involved in their derivation is cumbersome, it is straightforward. Therefore, we omit here the\ncorresponding details. The vanishing of the commutators (9) implies that the six generators of the \u03b7-spin and spin\nalgebras commute with V\u0302 ,\n[\u015c\u03b1z , V\u0302 ] = [\u015c\u03b1\u2020 , V\u0302 ] = [\u015c\u03b1 , V\u0302 ] = 0 ; \u03b1 = \u03b7, s .\n\n(10)\n\nThis confirms that for such six operators all operator terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) containing commutators\nvanish so that \u00d4 = \u00d5 for \u00d4 being any of such operators. Hence they have the same expression in terms of electron\nand rotated-electron operators and read,\n1\n1\n\u015c\u03b7z = \u2212 [NaD \u2212 N\u0302 ] = \u2212 [NaD \u2212 \u00d1 ] ;\n2\n2\n=\n\nNa\nX\n\ne\n\ni~\n\u03c0 *~\nrj\n\nc~r\u2020j \u2193 c~r\u2020j \u2191\n\n=\n\nNaD\n\nNaD\n\nX\nj=1\n\ne\n\ni~\n\u03c0 *~\nrj\n\nc\u0303~r\u2020j \u2193 c\u0303~r\u2020j \u2191\n\n;\n\nc~r\u2020j \u2193 c~rj \u2191 =\n\nX\n\n\u015c\u03b7 =\n\nNa\nX\n\ne\n\n\u2212i~\n\u03c0 *~\nrj\n\nc~rj \u2191 c~rj \u2193 =\n\nNaD\n\nc\u0303~r\u2020j \u2193 c\u0303~rj \u2191 ;\n\n\u015cs =\n\nX\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nc~r\u2020j \u2191 c~rj \u2193 =\n\nNa\nX\n\ne\u2212i~\u03c0*~rj c\u0303~rj \u2191 c\u0303~rj \u2193 ,\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n\u015cs\u2020 =\n\nNa\nX\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\n\u015c\u03b7\u2020\n\n1\n1\n\u015csz = \u2212 [N\u0302\u2191 \u2212 N\u0302\u2193 ] = \u2212 [\u00d1\u2191 \u2212 \u00d1\u2193 ] ,\n2\n2\n\nNaD\n\nX\n\nc\u0303~r\u2020j \u2191 c\u0303j, \u2193 ,\n\n(11)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the vector ~\u03c0 has Cartesian components ~\u03c0 = [\u03c0, \u03c0, ...].

It follows from the equalities of Eq. (11) that the six generators given in that equation can be represented\nPNaD\nPNaD\n\u00d5~rj . This holds in\n\u00d4~rj = j=1\nby polynomials of electron and rotated-electron operators of the same form, j=1\nspite of except for U/4t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e the corresponding local generators \u00d4~rj and \u00d5~rj being different operators, \u00d4~rj 6= \u00d5~rj .\nIndeed, the local generators \u00d4~rj do not in general commute with the unitary operator V\u0302 . This follows from m\u0302~rj ,l\u2032 ,l 6=\nP\nm\u0303~rj ,l\u2032 ,l , where m\u0302~rj ,l\u2032 ,l and m\u0303~rj ,l\u2032 ,l appear in the expressions \u00d4~rj = l,l\u2032 o~rj ,l,l\u2032 m\u0302~rj ,l\u2032 ,l \u2261 Tr (o~rj m\u0302~rj ) and (14) of \u00d5~rj ,\nrespectively. However, the matrix o~rj appearing in these two expressions is the same.

Alike the original Hamiltonian, H\u0303 has a global SO(4) symmetry whose generators are\nobtained as above. In addition, a similar procedure can be used to lift the local U (1) gauge symmetry to a global\nsymmetry of the \"rotated\" Hamiltonian for t > 0 and U/4t 6= 0. Indeed, through the polynomial of rotated-electron\noperators given in Eq. (14), the local generator of the \"nonlinear\" local U (1) gauge symmetry can be represented by\na 4 \u00d7 4 matrix given by,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n0 0 0\n0\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 0 0\n.\n(17)\no~rj = \uf8f0\n0 0 1/2 0 \uf8fb\n0 0 0 1/2\nThis local generator refers to rotated-electron single occupancy 2Sc . The use of such a matrix o~rj in the polynomial\nPNaD\n\u00d5~rj . It exactly equals expression (8) of the generator\n\u00d5~rj of Eq. (14) leads for U/4t 6= 0 to a sum of polynomials j=1\nof the global U (1) symmetry whose eigenvalue Sc is one half the number of rotated-electron singly occupied sites 2Sc .\nThe trivially related operator S\u0303ch \u2261 [D\u0303 + D\u0303h ]/2 of eigenvalue Sch = [NaD /2 \u2212 Sc ] can also generate such a global\nsymmetry of the \"rotated\" Hamiltonian H\u0303 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u0124 V\u0302 = \u1e7c \u2020 \u0124 \u1e7c .

However, [2NaD \u2212 2Sc ]\nand rotated-electron single occupancy 2Sc are not independent. Hence the operators S\u0303c \u2261 Q\u0303/2 of Eq. (8) associated\nwith the matrix o~rj of Eq. (17) and S\u0303ch \u2261 [D\u0303 + D\u0303h ]/2 associated with the matrix o~rj of Eq. (18) refer to two alternative\nrepresentations of the generator of the global U (1) symmetry of the \"rotated\" Hamiltonian under consideration.\nThe main point is that a global U (1) symmetry in the \"rotated\" Hamiltonian H\u0303 = V\u0302 \u2020 \u0124 V\u0302 = \u1e7c \u2020 \u0124 \u1e7c for t > 0\nand U/4t 6= 0 must also be a global U (1) symmetry, which is hidden in the original model \u0124 = V\u0302 H\u0303 V\u0302 \u2020 = \u1e7c H\u0303 \u1e7c \u2020\nof Eq. (7). Indeed, for the latter original model the generator (8) refers to one half the number of rotated electrons\nrather than electrons. And in contrast to the six generators (11) of the global SO(4) symmetry, the number of rotated\nelectrons operator does not commute with the unitary operator V\u0302 . Other related operators D\u0303, D\u0303h , and Q\u0303\u03c3 , which for\n\n\f6\nU/4t 6= 0 also commute with the Hamiltonian (1) yet do not commute with V\u0302 , are obtained by rotating the number\noperators D\u0302, D\u0302h , and Q\u0302\u03c3 , respectively, given in Eq. (3). For the NaD -site problem only for rotated electrons does\nsingle and double occupancy remain good quantum numbers for finite |U/4t| > 0, whereas for electrons single and\ndouble occupancy are conserved only for |U/4t| \u2192 \u221e. This is why the generator (8) does not commute with V\u0302 .\nSince NaD is even, both [S\u03b7 +Ssz ] and [S\u03b7z +Ssz ] are integers. Their relation to Sc is such that 2Sc and [NaD \u22122Sc ] give\nthe number of spin-1/2 spins of the rotated electrons that singly occupy sites and the number of \u03b7-spin-1/2 \"\u03b7-spins\",\nrespectively. The former number equals that of rotated-electron singly occupied sites and the latter number that of\nrotated-electron doubly occupied sites (down \u03b7-spins) plus rotated-electron unoccupied sites (up \u03b7-spins), respectively.\nTherefore, [S\u03b7z + Ssz + Sc ] must also be an integer. This justifies why for U/4t 6= 0 the global symmetry of the model\n(1) on a bipartite lattice is that of the group [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z22 = SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) rather than\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). The global U (1) symmetry remained hidden because in contrast to the six generators (11),\nPNaD\nPNaD\n\u00d4~rj . (Note that\n\u00d5~rj is except for |U/4t| \u2192 \u221e different from the operator j=1\none has that the generator S\u0303c = j=1\nthe matrix o~rj is given by Eq. (17) both in the \u00d5~rj and \u00d4~rj expressions.) Indeed, when written in terms of electron\ncreation and annihilation operators the expression of the generator S\u0303c is for |U/4t| finite involved, consisting of an\ninfinite number of operator terms,\nD\n\nD\n\n\u0013\nNa \u0012\nX\n1\n\u00d4~rj + [\u00d4~rj , \u015c \u2020 ] + [[\u00d4~rj , \u015c \u2020 ], \u015c \u2020 ] + ... ,\nV\u0302 \u00d4~rj V\u0302 =\nS\u0303c =\n2\nj=1\nj=1\nNa\nX\n\nrather than merely by\nPNaD\n\u00d4~rj .\nS\u0303c = \u015cc = j=1\nB.\n\nPNaD\n\nj=1\n\n\u2020\n\n(19)\n\n\u00d4~rj . Only for |U/4t| \u2192 \u221e one has that the commutator [\u00d4~rj , \u015c \u2020 ] = 0 vanishes, so that\n\nConsistency between the global symmetry and the Hilbert space dimension\n\nAddition of chemical-potential and magnetic-field operator terms to the Hamiltonian (1) lowers its symmetry.\nHowever, such terms commute with it. Therefore, the global symmetry being [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z22 = SO(3) \u00d7\nSO(3) \u00d7 U (1) implies that the set of independent rotated-electron occupancy configurations that generate the model\nenergy eigenstates generate state representations of that global symmetry for all values of the electronic density\nn and spin density m. It then follows that the total number of such independent representations must equal the\nD\nHilbert-space dimension 4Na . Here we show that for the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice the number of\nD\nindependent representations of the group SO(3)\u00d7SO(3)\u00d7U (1) is indeed 4Na . In contrast, the number of independent\nD\nrepresentations of the group SO(4) is for that model found to be smaller than its Hilbert-space dimension 4Na . This\nis then consistent with the global symmetry of the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice being larger than SO(4) and\ngiven by SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1).\nThe rotated-electron occupancy configurations involving the (i) singly occupied and (ii) unoccupied and doublyoccupied sites are independent. They refer to the state representations of the spin SU (2) symmetry Ms = 2Sc spin-1/2\nspins and \u03b7-spin SU (2) symmetry M\u03b7 = 2Sch \u03b7-spin-1/2 \u03b7-spins, respectively. Indeed, concerning the \u03b7-spin SU (2)\nrepresentations the rotated-electron doubly occupied sites and unoccupied sites play the role of down and up \u03b7-spin-1/2\n\u03b7-spins, respectively. In turn, the U (1) symmetry state representations refer to the relative occupancy configurations\nof the 2Sc rotated-electron singly-occupied sites and 2Sch rotated-electron unoccupied and doubly-occupied sites. For\nU/4t 6= 0, the Hilbert space can then be divided into a set of subspaces with fixed S\u03b7 , Ss , and Sc values and thus with\nthe same values M\u03b7 = 2Sch of \u03b7-spins and Ms = 2Sc of spins. The number of SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) state representations\nwith both fixed values of S\u03b7 and Ss , which one can generate from M\u03b7 \u03b7-spin-1/2 \u03b7-spins and Ms spin-1/2 spins, reads\nN (S\u03b7 , M\u03b7 ). N (Ss , Ms ). Here,\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u001a\u0012\nM\u03b1\nM\u03b1\n,\n(20)\n\u2212\nN (S\u03b1 , M\u03b1 ) = (2S\u03b1 + 1)\nM\u03b1 /2 \u2212 S\u03b1 \u2212 1\nM\u03b1 /2 \u2212 S\u03b1\nfor \u03b1 = \u03b7, s. If for U/4t 6= 0 the global symmetry of the model was SO(4), then the dimension of such a subspace\nwould be N (S\u03b7 , M\u03b7 ). N (Ss , Ms ) and the sum of all sub-space dimensions would give the Hilbert-space dimension\n\n\f7\nD\n\n4Na . However, we confirm below that such a sum obeys the inequality,\nD\n\nNa\nM\u03b7 /2 Ms /2\nX\nX X Y [1 \u2212 (\u22121)[2S\u03b1 \u2212(M\u03b7 \u2212Ms )/2] ]\nN (S\u03b1 , M\u03b1 )\n2\n\u03b1=\u03b7,s\n\nMs =0 S\u03b7 =0 Ss =0\nD\n\n=\n\nNa\nX\n\nM\u03b7 /2 Ms /2\n\nX X Y [1 \u2212 (\u22121)[2S\u03b1 \u2212(M\u03b7 \u2212Ms )/2] ]\nD\nN (S\u03b1 , M\u03b1 ) < 4Na ,\n2\n\u03b1=\u03b7,s\n\n(21)\n\nM\u03b7 =0 S\u03b7 =0 Ss =0\n\nD\n\nand thus corresponds to a dimension smaller than 4Na . Note that M\u03b7 = [NaD \u2212 Ms ] so that the numbers M\u03b7 and\nMs are not independent. Therefore, the sums over Ms = 0, 1, ..., NaD and M\u03b7 = 0, 1, ..., NaD are indeed alternative, as\ngiven in Eq. (21).\nIn turn, that the model global symmetry is larger than SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2 and given by SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7\nU (1) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]/Z22 requires that one accounts for the number of representation states of the extra\nglobal U (1) symmetry. For U/4t 6= 0 it has in the subpaces considered here,\n\u0012 D\u0013 \u0012 D \u0013\nNa\nNa\ndc =\n=\n,\n(22)\n2Sc\n2Sch\nrepresentation states. Thus rather than N (S\u03b7 , M\u03b7 ). N (Ss , Ms ) each of such subspaces has a larger dimension,\nd(S\u03b7 , Ss , Sc ) = dc . N (S\u03b7 , NaD \u2212 2Sc ). N (Ss , 2Sc ) .\n\n(23)\n\nBy performing the sum over all subspaces, one then finds indeed in Appendix A that,\n[NaD /2] [NaD /2\u2212S\u03b7 ]\nSc \u0012 D \u0013 Y\nX\nX\nX\n[1 + (\u22121)[2S\u03b7 +2Ss ] ]\nNa\n[1 + (\u22121)[2S\u03b1 +2Sc ] ]\nN (S\u03b1 , M\u03b1 ) =\n=\n2\n2\n2Sc \u03b1=\u03b7,s\nS\u03b7 =0\nSc =0\nSs =0\nS\u03b7 =0\nSs =0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nh\nNaD\nNaD\nNaD\n\u00d7 (2S\u03b7 + 1) (2Ss + 1)\n+\nD\nD\nD\nNa /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 + Ss\nNa /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 \u2212 Ss\nNa /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 \u2212 Ss \u2212 2\n\u0013\u001bi\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u001a\u0012\n\u0012\nD\nD\nD\nD\nNa\nNa\nNa\n= 4Na .\n(24)\n+\n\u2212\nNaD /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 + Ss \u2212 1\nNaD /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 + Ss + 1\nNaD /2 \u2212 S\u03b7 \u2212 Ss \u2212 1\n[NaD /2] [NaD /2\u2212Sc ]\n\nNtot\n\nX\n\nX\n\nFinally, except that a factor of one in each term of the two alternative sums of Eq. (21) is replaced by the\ndimension dc in the sum of Eq. (24), such sums are identical. This is confirmed by transforming the sums over Ms =\n0, 1, ..., NaD and M\u03b7 = 0, 1, ..., NaD of Eq. (21) in sums over Sc = Ms /2 = 0, 1/2, ..., NaD /2 and Sc = NaD /2 \u2212 M\u03b7 /2 =\nNaD /2, NaD /2 \u2212 1/2, ..., 1/2, 0, respectively, and accounting for that 2Sc can be written as 2Sc = NaD /2 \u2212 (M\u03b7 \u2212 Ms )/2\nwhere NaD /2 is an odd integer number. That the dimension of Eq. (22) obeys the inequality dc \u2265 1 then implies the\nvalidity of the inequality given in Eq. (21).\nC.\n\nRelation of the global symmetry to the exact solution of the 1D model\n\nIn the particular case of the bipartite 1D lattice the Hubbard model has an exact solution8\u201310 . Since the global\nSO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry found here refers to 1D as well, it must be related to that exact solution. Such\na solution refers to the 1D Hubbard model in the subspace spanned by the highest-weight states (HWSs) or lowestweight states (LWSs) of both the \u03b7-spin SU (2) and spin SU (2) algebras. The model energy eigenstates that are HWSs\nor LWSs of these algebras are often called Bethe states. In order to clarify such a relation, rather than the so called\ncoordinate Bethe ansatz8,9 , it is convenient to consider the exact solution of the problem by the algebraic operator\nformulation of Ref.10 . Within the latter formulation the HWSs or LWSs of the \u03b7-spin and spin algebras are built up\nin terms of linear combination of products of several types of annihilation or creation fields acting onto the hole or\nelectronic vacuum, respectively.\nThe algebraic formulation of the Bethe states refers to the transfer matrix of the classical coupled spin model,\nwhich is the \"covering\" 1D Hubbard model15 . Indeed, within the inverse scattering method10,16 the central object\nto be diagonalized is the quantum transfer matrix rather than the underlying 1D Hubbard model. The transfermatrix eigenvalues provide the spectrum of a set of conserved charges. The diagonalization of the charge degrees of\n\n\f8\nfreedom involves a transfer matrix associated with a charge monodromy matrix of the form provided in Eq. (21) of\nRef.10 . Its off-diagonal entries are some of the creation and annihilation fields. The commutation relations of such\nimportant operators are given in Eqs. (25), (40)-(42), (B.1)-(B.3), (B.7)-(B.11), and (B.19)-(B.22) of that reference.\nThe solution of the spin degrees of freedom involves the diagonalization of the auxiliary transfer matrix associated\nwith the spin monodromy matrix provided in Eq. (95) of Ref.10 . Again, the off-diagonal entries of that matrix play\nthe role of creation and annihilation fields, whose commutation relations are given in Eq. (98) of that reference. The\nlatter commutation relations correspond to the usual Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra associated with the traditional\nABCD form of the elements of the monodromy matrix16 . It also applies to the 1D isotropic Heinsenberg model, whose\nglobal symmetry is SU (2). Consistently, at half filling and for large U/4t values the latter model describes the spin\ndegrees of freedom of the 1D Hubbard model. In turn, the above relations associated with the charge monodromy\nmatrix refer to a different algebra. The corresponding form of that matrix is called ABCDF by the authors of Ref.10 .\nThe main reason why the solution of the problem by the algebraic inverse scattering method10 was achieved only\nthirty years after that of the coordinate Bethe ansatz8,9 is that it was expected that the charge and spin monodromy\nmatrices had the same traditional ABCD form, found previously for the related 1D isotropic Heinsenberg model16 .\nIndeed, such an expectation was that consistent with the occurrence of a spin SU (2) symmetry and a charge (and\n\u03b7-spin) SU (2) symmetry known long ago11 , associated with a global SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2 symmetry. If that\nwas the whole global symmetry of the 1D Hubbard model, the charge and spin sectors would be associated with the\n\u03b7-spin SU (2) symmetry and spin SU (2) symmetry, respectively. A global SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2 symmetry\nwould then imply that the charge and spin monodromy matrices had indeed the same Faddeev-Zamolodchikov ABCD\nform.\nHowever, all tentative schemes using charge and spin monodromy matrices of the same ABCD form failed to achieve\nthe Bethe-ansatz equations obtained by means of the coordinate Bethe ansatz8,9 . Fortunately, the problem was solved\nby Martins and Ramos, who used an appropriate representation of the charge and spin monodromy matrices, which\nallows for possible hidden symmetries10 . Indeed, the structure of the charge and spin monodromy matrices introduced\nby these authors is able to distinguish creation and annihilation fields as well as possible hidden symmetries.\nOur results refer to the Hubbard model on any bipartite lattice. Hence for the particular case of the bipartite\n1D lattice they show that the hidden symmetry beyond SO(4) is the charge global U (1) symmetry found in this\npaper. Our studies reveal that for U/4t > 0 the model charge and spin degrees of freedom are associated with U (2) =\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) and SU (2) symmetries, rather than with two SU (2) symmetries, respectively. The occurrence of such\ncharge U (2) = SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry and spin SU (2) symmetry is behind the different ABCDF and ABCD forms\nof the charge and spin monodromy matrices of Eqs. (21) and (95) of Ref.10 , respectively. Indeed, the former matrix\nis larger than the latter and involves more fields than expected from the model global SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2\nsymmetry alone. This follows from the global symmetry of the model on the 1D and other bipartite lattices being\nSO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) = [SU (2) \u00d7 U (2)]/Z22 rather than SO(4) = [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2 , as found in this paper. Hence\nour general results for the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice are consistent with the algebraic operator formulation\nof its exact solution for the particular case of the 1D lattice10 .\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOn a square lattice, the Hubbard model is one of the most studied condensed-matter quantum problems. Furthermore, on any bipartite lattice it is the simplest realistic toy model for description of the electronic correlation effects\nin general many-electron problems with short-range interaction. Therefore, that the global symmetry of the Hubbard\nmodel on a bipartite lattice is larger than SO(4) and given by SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) is an important exact result in\nits own right. Furthermore, the new found global symmetry is expected to have important physical consequences.\nThe studies of Ref.17 on the Hubbard model on the square lattice use a description in terms of quantum objects\nrelated to the rotated electrons. The introduction of such a description involves the global symmetry found in this\npaper and corresponding transformation laws under a suitable electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation of\nthe type considered here and in Ref.13 . The spinless c fermion, spin-1/2 spinon, and \u03b7-spin-1/2 \u03b7-spinon operators of\nsuch a description are a generalization to U/4t > 0 of the U/4t \u226b 1 \"quasicharge\", spin, and \"pseudospin\" operators\nof Ref.14 , respectively. The former quantum objects emerge from a suitable electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation.Their operators have the same expressions in terms of rotated-electron creation and annihilation operators\nas those of Ref.14 in terms of electron creation and annihilation operators, respectively. The occupancy configurations of the spinless c fermions, spin-1/2 spinons, and \u03b7-spin-1/2 \u03b7-spinons generate a set of complete states. Those\ncorrespond to representations of the U (1), spin SU (2), and \u03b7-spin SU (2) symmetries, respectively, associated with\nthe three dimensions of Eq. (23) and the global symmetry found in this paper.\nThe square-lattice quantum liquid introduced in Ref.17 contains the one- and two-electron excitations of the Hubbard\nmodel on a square lattice. At hole concentration x = [Na2 \u2212 N ]/Na2 = 0, U/4t \u2248 1.525, and t \u2248 295 meV it is found\n\n\f9\nin that reference to quantitatively describing the spin-wave spectrum observed in the parent compound La2 CuO4 18 .\nA system of weakly coupled planes, each described by the square-lattice quantum liquid of Ref.17 , is the simplest\nrealistic toy model for the description of the role of correlations effects in the unusual properties of the cuprate highttemperature superconductors5\u20137 . After addition of such a weak three-dimensional uniaxial anisotropy perturbation,\nthe Hamiltonian terms that describe the fluctuations of two important pairing phases are for intermediate U/4t\nvalues found to have the same general form as the microscopic Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) of Ref.7 . The main\ndifference is that the electron creation and annihilation operators appear replaced by rotated-electron creation and\nannihilation operators, respectively. Evidence is provided elsewhere that such a quantum liquid has for a well-defined\nhole-concentration range a long-range superconducting order. In addition, it seems indeed to contain some of the\nmicroscopic mechanisms behind the unusual properties of the hole-doped cuprate hight-temperature superconductors.\nIt is commonly understood that Hamiltonian symmetries by themselves are not sufficient to prove that a particular\nsymmetry is broken in the ground state. However, the symmetry of the action that describes the fluctuations of\nthe phases of such a quantum liquid and of that of Ref.7 is a global superconducting U (1) symmetry. In the case\nof the former quantum liquid the representations of such a U (1) symmetry are generated by c fermion occupancy\nconfigurations. Thus it is directly related to the original model hidden global U (1) symmetry found in this paper,\nwhose representations are also generated by c fermion occupancy configurations. Such a preliminary result seems to\nconfirm the important role plaid by the hidden U (1) symmetry of the global SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry found\nin this paper for the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Alejandro Muramatsu, Tiago C.
