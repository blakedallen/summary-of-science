Introduction\nThe galaxy luminosity function (hereafter LF), defined as\nthe number density of galaxies per unit interval of luminosity is a fundamental statistical tool required to model\nthe formation, evolution and clustering of the galaxies. At\nz <\n\u223c 1, it is well established that the LF depends on the\ngalaxy morphological type (Binggeli et al. 1988; Marzke\net al. 1998; Loveday et al. 1999), and that it evolves with\nredshift (Lilly et al. 1996; Lin et al. 1999; Bromley et al.\n1998; de Lapparent et al. 2002a). Measurement of the LF\nthus requires large galaxy samples which can be separated\ninto several morphological, spectral or color classes and in\nredshift intervals. Among the next generation redshift surveys, only 3 will be able to probe the galaxy LF to z \u223c 1.\nThe DEEP redshift survey using Keck telescopes (Davis &\nFaber 1998) and the VIRMOS redshift survey using the\nVLT (Le Fevre et al. 1998) are optimized for clustering\nanalyses, but they will also provide measurements of the\nSend offprint requests to: R. A. Cabanac\n\u22c6\nFellow of Fonds FCAR, Qu\u00e9bec\n\ngalaxy LFs, even if the 2 surveys shall suffer from various\naperture effects and calibration difficulties. The third survey is the Large Zenith Telescope (hereafter LZT) survey,\nwhich is optimized for the measurements of the galaxy\nLFs to z \u223c 1.\nAn essential step in the measurement of the LF for a\nsystematic survey is the classification of objects as stars,\ngalaxies, QSOs, etc. For the galaxies and QSOs, an estimate of the redshift for each object is also desired. This\npaper proposes and tests a classification approach based\non the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), also known\nas Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion \u2013 the underlying principles of the PCA were independently derived by Karhunen\n(1947) and Lo\u00e8ve (1948). The PCA is a non-parametric\napproach which has been successfully used for a variety\nof astronomical applications including stellar classification from photometric data (Deeming 1964; Scarfe 1966;\nWhitney 1983a,b) and from spectra (Storrie-Lombardi\net al. 1994; Ibata & Irwin 1997; Bailer-Jones et al. 1998;\nSingh et al. 1998), galaxy classification from photometric data (Watanabe et al. 1985) and from galaxy spec-\n\n\f2\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nTable 1.

The\nPCA has not been tested on spectral energy distributions\n(SED) with R \u223c 40 because no such data existed until the UBC-NASA Multi-narrowband survey (Hickson &\nMulrooney 1998; Cabanac et al. 1998).\nIn this paper we use simulations based on the LZT\nsurvey parameters to evaluate the PCA method. Section\n2 describes our simulations of mock LZT catalogues, Sect.\n3 describes the approach used to classify the objects using\nthe PCA, Sect. 4 shows the efficiency of the classification\nand Sect. 5 discusses the redshift accuracies which can\nbe obtained directly from the PCA or from a composite method similar to that described by Glazebrook et al.\n(1998).\n\n2. Mock catalogues\nIn order to be able to simulate the classification efficiency\nof the PCA, we create mock catalogues which match as\nclosely as possible the observations of the LZT. A calibration of the PCA on real data is still necessary to extract\nsensible physical information. The problem is addressed in\nanother paper in preparation (Cabanac et al. 2002) using\ndata from the NASA Orbital Debris Observatory (NODO;\nHickson & Mulrooney 1998).\n\n2.1.

With first-light expected in 2002,\nit will conduct drift-scan surveys of a strip of sky centered at 49\u25e6 17\u2032 declination. The main characteristics of\nthe LZT are given in Table 1. It is a zenith-pointing telescope equipped with a 2k \u00d7 2k thinned CCD (0.5\u2032\u2032 /pix)\nat the prime focus, which scans a 17\u2032 \u00d7 110\u25e6 strip of sky\nat sidereal rate. Forty medium-band filters are employed\nwhich have logarithmically-separated central wavelengths\nfrom 4000 \u00c5 to 1 \u03bc and one broad-band U filter. The\nsurvey is expected to yield calibrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for \u223c 106 galaxies to R \u2264 23 (z \u223c 1),\n\u223c 104 QSOs and \u223c 105 stars.\n\n2.2.

We use the\ngalaxy model of Bahcall & Soneira (Bahcall 1986)\n(http://www.sns.ias.edu/\u223cjnb/Html/galaxy.html html)\nto derive star counts and colors. Table 2 lists the star\ncounts and colors predicted for a limiting magnitude\nof R \u2264 23. The template spectra are collected from\nthe star catalog of Pickles (1998), available at CDS\n(http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/).

The template spectra are\nfiltered using the transmission curves of Fig. 1. Figure 2\nshows examples of template stellar spectra.\nThe simulation proceeds as follows.

Galaxies\n2.3.1. Luminosity functions\nRealistic simulations of galaxy morphology and redshift\ndistributions are crucial but difficult because they require\na prior knowledge of the morphological (or spectral) typedependent LFs. The \"intrinsic\" LFs based on morphological type are only measured locally at z <\n\u223c 0.03 (Binggeli\net al. 1988; Marzke et al. 1994; Jerjen & Tammann 1997;\nMarzke et al. 1998; Marinoni et al. 1999). Recent surveys\nto z \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1, in which galaxies are separated in 2 or 3\nclasses using colors or spectral measures indicate that the\nintrinsic LFs evolve with redshift (Lilly et al. 1995; Heyl\net al. 1997; Lin et al. 1999; de Lapparent et al. 2002a), but\n\n3\n\nthe relation with the nearby LFs based on morphological\ntype is not straightforward.\nTo simulate an approximate LZT galaxy catalog, we\nmust choose a model for the intrinsic LFs in the redshift\nrange of the LZT survey (0 <\n\u223cz <\n\u223c 1). Because the LZT\nsurvey will be most sensitive in the red filters, Table 3 lists\nthe galaxy LFs \u03c6(MR ) of the existing red-band selected\nsurveys which extend at or beyond z \u223c 0.5. The deep blueband selected survey by (Heyl et al. 1997) is therefore\nnot considered. The LFs in Table 3 are defined by the\nSchechter parameterization (Schechter 1976),\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6(M )dM = 0.4 ln 10 \u03c6\u2217 10\u22120.4(M \u2212M)(\u03b1+1) dM\ni\nh\n\u2217\n\u00d7 \u2212100.4(M \u2212M) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M is the absolute magnitude, and \u03c6\u2217 , M \u2217 , and \u03b1\nare the Schechter parameters. All parameters in Table 3\ncorrespond to the case of a flat Universe with \u039b = 0 and\nH0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nThe LFs in Table 3 are binned into early and late-type\ngalaxies, and the measured evolution in the Schechter parameters is indicated for the samples in which it is detected. For the CNOC2 survey (Lin et al. 1999), the first\nclass is their denoted \"Early+Intermediate\" class, and the\nsecond class is their denoted \"Late\" class; these classes\nare obtained by least-square fit to the SEDs by Coleman\net al. (1980). For the ESS (de Lapparent et al. 2002b), the\nspectral classification is obtained by a PCA calibrated on\nthe Kennicutt sample of nearby galaxy spectra (Kennicutt\n1992). Lilly et al. (1995) divide the CFRS sample into a\npopulation redder than Sbc, defined as having rest-frame\n[U \u2212 V ]AB = 1.38 ([U \u2212 V ]AB \u2243 [V \u2212 I]AB at z \u223c 0.5,\nVAB = V , and IAB = I + 0.48), and a population bluer\nthan Sbc, defined as the remaining galaxies. In Table 3,\nthe Schechter LF parameter M \u2217 is listed in the Rc Cousins\nband, used by the CNOC2 (Lin et al. 1999) and the ESS\n(de Lapparent et al. 2002a,b). For the CFRS (Lilly et al.\n1995), we use the M \u2217 values derived by the authors in\nthe BAB band for the galaxies with 0.2 \u2264 z \u2264 0.5, and\nwe convert them into the Rc band using BAB = B \u2212 0.17\n(Lilly et al. 1995), and assuming B \u2212 Rc = 1.35 for galaxies redder than Sbc, and B \u2212 Rc = 0.85 for galaxies bluer\nthan Sbc (Fukugita et al. 1995). Note that we have also\nconverted the CFRS M \u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 from Lilly et al. (1995)\nfrom H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 used by the authors, to\nH0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 used here.\nFor comparison with a red-band selected survey at low\nredshift (0 \u2264 z \u2264 0.2), we also quote in Table 3 the LCRS\nsurvey (Bromley et al. 1998). The rGunn magnitudes are\nconverted into Rc using rGunn \u2212Rc = 0.36 (Fukugita et al.\n1995). For this survey, the spectral classification is obtained by a PCA, but it is not calibrated on spectra of\nknown morphology. The grouping of galaxies into early\nand late-types must thus be done arbitrarily. In Table 3,\nwe show the LFs obtained by grouping galaxies in clan\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 into the early-types, and those in clans 5 + 6\nas the late-types. The corresponding listed Schechter parameters MR\u2217 and \u03b1 for the early and late-type galaxies are\n\n\f4\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 2. 9 templates of stellar spectra from the Pickles library (1998), containing 131 spectra.

Spectral types are indicated.\n\nobtained by averaging the Schechter parameters over the\nconsidered clans. We calculate the corresponding amplitudes \u03c6\u2217 for the 2 average LFs by adjusting their integral\nin the absolute magnitude interval \u221223 \u2264 MR \u2264 \u221216.5\nto the sum of the observed numbers of galaxies in the\nconsidered classes; a total survey area of 462 deg2 is used\n(Shectman et al. 1996). The systematic bias against low\nsurface-brightness galaxies which is present in the LCRS\nspectroscopic survey, tends to exclude late-type galaxies.\nThis explains the relatively low \u03c6\u2217 (z \u2243 0) for the late-type\ngalaxies in the LCRS as compared to the other surveys (by\na factor of 3 to 5). This effect is might also be present in\nthe LCRS early-type class (defined as clans 1 + 2 + 3 + 4),\nand could explain the \u223c 50% lower \u03c6\u2217 compared to that\nfor the deeper surveys (ESS and CFRS).\n\nWe also show in Table 3, the LFs obtained for a different grouping of the LCRS clans: early-type are galaxies in\nclans 1 + 2 + 3, and late-type are galaxies in clans 4 + 5 + 6.\nThe resulting variations in the Schechter luminosity functions illustrates the sensitivity of the intrinsic LFs to the\nscheme used for galaxy classification. The systematically\nlow \u03c6\u2217 for both galaxy classes in either groupings (1+2+3\nand 4 + 5 + 6, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 and 5 + 6) as compared to\nthe deeper surveys CNOC2, ESS, and CFRS (see Table\n3), further suggests that the LCRS suffers from selection\neffects causing an under-sampling of the galaxy populations.\nThe LFs for early and late-type galaxies at z >\n\u223c 0.5\nlisted in Table 3 show reasonable agreement among the\nvarious samples. The dominant source of variation in the\nLFs for each galaxy type are caused by the differences\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

(1998); the LFs are measured in the interval \u221223 \u2264 MR \u2264 \u221216.5\n\nin the definitions of the spectral classes among the samples. This is reflected in the varying ratio of early to latetype galaxies among the surveys (see Col. Ngal in Table\n3). Kochanek et al. (2000) recently showed that the mixing of the morphological classes which is often present in\nspectral classification can cause systematic biases in the\nparameters of the LFs. The varying selection effects from\nsurvey to survey (such as the mentioned bias in the LCRS\nagainst low-surface brightness objects) also contribute to\nthe differences in the LFs.\nThe deep surveys quoted in Table 3 detect evolution of\nthe LFs with redshift (Lilly et al. 1995; Lin et al. 1999; de\nLapparent et al. 2002a). Understanding the details of this\nevolution is still a matter of debate. Here, we list some scenarii proposed in the corresponding articles. In the Lilly\n\net al. (1995) survey, the red galaxies show no or little\ndensity or luminosity evolution in the range 0 <\n\u223c z <\n\u223c 1,\nwhereas the blue galaxies show a luminosity evolution of\nat least 1 magnitude in that redshift range. The CNOC2\nanalysis separates the luminosity evolution from the density evolution. Early and intermediate-type galaxies show\na small luminosity evolution in the range 0.1 <\n\u223c z <\n\u223c 0.7\n(\u2206M \u2217 \u2243 0.5), whereas late-type galaxies show a clear density evolution with almost no luminosity evolution in the\nsame redshift range. Finally, for the ESS, an evolution\nin \u03c6\u2217 for the late-type galaxies is detected. These various evolutions are listed in Table 3, in the Col. labeled\n\"Evolution\".\nFigures 3, 4, and 5 show for each survey displayed in\nTable 3 the redshift distributions calculated for the listed\n\n\f6\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 3.

The non-evolving and evolving distributions for the early+intermediate galaxies are\nshown as a thin dashed line, resp. thick dashed line, and\nfor the late-type galaxies, as a thin dotted line, resp. thick\ndotted line. The non-evolving and evolving total distributions are shown as thin solid line, resp. thick solid line.\n\nSchechter parameters: without evolution (thin dashed line\nfor early-type galaxies, and thin dotted line for late-type\ngalaxies), and with evolution when it applies (thick dashed\nline for early-type galaxies, thick dotted line for late-type\ngalaxies). These predicted redshift distributions are calculated in the case of a flat Universe with \u039b = 0 and\nH0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , over the 40 deg2 planned area\nfor the LZT survey, and are extrapolated to the limiting\nmagnitude of the LZT survey, namely Rc \u2264 23.0. In Fig.\n5, we model the observed evolution of the CFRS blue LF\nwith a brightening in MR\u2217 , defined by the additive term\nm(z) = \u22122[1 \u2212 exp \u2212(z \u2212 0.3)]; this yields m = 0.0 for\nz = 0.3, m = \u22121.0 for z = 0.6, m = \u22121.9 for z = 1.0,\nand m = \u22122.7 for z = 1.5. For comparison, the redshift\ndistributions for the early and late-type LFs for the LCRS\ndivided in clans 1 + 2 + 3 and 4 + 5 + 6 are shown in Fig.\n6 (no evolution is considered).\nIn Figs. 3, 4, 5, the systematic differences between the\nevolving early-type/red and late-type/blue galaxy redshift\ndistributions show common properties. The peak for the\nlate-type distribution is at smaller redshift than that for\nthe early-type distribution because of the combination of\nfainter M \u2217 and steeper slope \u03b1 for the first class of objects.\nThis effect is preserved when evolution of the early-type\nand/or late-type population are introduced, despite the\nfact that all evolution scenarii quoted in Table 3 tend to\nshift the peaks of the redshift distributions to higher redshift. The interesting result derived from the comparison\nof Figs. 3, 4, 5, is that the 3 parameterizations of the LF\nevolution lead to resembling galaxy redshift distributions\nin the range 0 <\n\u223cz <\n\u223c 1 at the depth of the LZT survey\n\nFig. 4.

In contrast, the LCRS produces a systematically low redshift distribution at this depth, with a\npeak at \u223c 600 galaxies, whereas the no-evolution curves\nfor the deeper surveys shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, all peak in\nthe range \u223c 900 \u2212 1200 galaxies; as already mentioned,\nthis may arise from selection effects in the LCRS.\nWe therefore choose to adopt for all mock catalogues\nconsidered here the following LF Schechter parameters:\nMR\u2217 = \u221220.42, \u03b1 = \u22120.16, \u03c6\u2217 = 0.03 for early-type galaxies; MR\u2217 = \u221220.18, \u03b1 = \u22121.19, \u03c6\u2217 = 0.01 for late-type\ngalaxies (also listed in Table 3). These chosen \u03b1 for the\nearly-type galaxies, and the MR\u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 for both galaxy\ntypes are within the range of values measured for the 3\nR-selected surveys in Table 3: the CNOC2, the ESS, and\nthe LCRS. The slope \u03b1 = \u22121.19 for the late-type galaxies is flatter than the flattest measured slope (from the\nLCRS, clans 4 + 5 + 6), in order to limit the number of\ngalaxies to be included in the mock LZT catalogues, and\nthus the computing time for the PCA; this value is however only 1.25\u03c3 flatter than the slope of the LF for the\nCNOC2 late-type galaxies. Having a steeper slope for the\nlate-type galaxies would have a weak impact on the results presented here. Note that the chosen values of \u03c6\u2217\nfor the early and late-type LFs are obtained by using an\nearly-type to late-type \u03c6\u2217 ratio of 3 (as in the CFRS)\nand by normalizing the total number of galaxies per deg2\nwith Rc \u2264 23 to the observations: numerous studies give\ngalaxy counts in the R band, and we use a typical value of\n\u223c 30, 000 galaxies/deg2 (Roche et al. 1996; Metcalfe et al.\n2001).\n\n7\n\nFig. 7.

The expected distribution for the evolving late-type galaxies, modeled by an MR\u2217 brightening define by MR\u2217 (z \u2265 0.5) \u2243 MR\u2217 (z = 0.5) \u2212 2(1 \u2212 e0.5\u2212z ) is\nshown as a thick dotted line. The thin, resp. thick continuous lines show the sums of the curves for the non-evolving\nearly-type galaxies and the non-evolving, resp. evolving\nlate-type galaxies. The evolving sum is subsequently used\nfor generating the mock LZT catalogues.\n\nBecause the LZT survey will have a depth comparable\nwith that of the CFRS, we adopt an evolution of the LF\nresembling that for the CFRS, but which better matches\nthe evolution at z > 1 (as shown in Fig. 7, a non negligeable fraction of galaxies, 27%, will have z \u2265 1 in the\nLZT survey). Although the evolution of the galaxy LFs\nis poorly known beyond z = 1, photometric redshifts applied to the Hubble Deep Field do provide a general trend\nfor the evolution of the \"total\" LF: a steepening of the\nslope \u03b1 from \u22121.3 (z \u223c 0.5) to \u22122 (z \u223c 3), and a one\nmagnitude brightening of MB\u2217 between z \u223c 1 and z \u223c 3\n(Sawicki et al. 1997; Takeuchi et al. 2000). We therefore\nconservatively assume no evolution of both the early and\nlate-type galaxy LFs in the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 0.5, and add\na brightening term m(z) = \u22122[1 \u2212 exp \u2212(z \u2212 0.5)] to MR\u2217\nfor the LZT blue galaxies with z \u2265 0.5. The brightening term m(z) gradually changes MR\u2217 by m = \u22120.83 at\nz = 1, m = \u22121.0 at z = 1.19, m = \u22121.26 at z = \u22121.5,\nm = \u22121.55 at z = 2, and m = \u22121.8 at z = 3; it asymptotically reaches its ceiling of m = \u22122 at z \u2265 3. The\ncorresponding redshift distribution for the evolving latetype galaxies in the modeled LZT survey is given in Fig.\n7 (thick dotted line); it is combined with the non-evolving\nearly-type redshift distribution (thin dashed line) to de-\n\n\f8\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nrive the sum of the 2 populations in the evolving model\n(thick continuous line). This summed redshift distribution is subsequently adopted for the LZT mock surveys\nanalyzed here. For comparison, the corresponding nonevolving late-type galaxies distribution (thin dotted line)\nand non-evolving total distribution (thick continuous line)\nare also shown in Fig. 7.\nOver the planned area of 40 deg2 for the LZT survey,\nover \u223c 1, 000, 000 galaxies are expected. Because the PCA\nis computer-time consuming, we limit the size of the LZT\nmock catalogues used in the following analyses to 1 deg2 .\nThese calatogue therefore include \u223c 30, 000 galaxies, and\nthe number of galaxies in each class are those listed in\nTable 3.\n\n2.3.2. Galaxy spectral energy distributions\nThe galaxy templates are extracted from stellar synthesis libraries. Figure 8 shows 24 templates of E/S0, Sa/Sb,\nSc/Sd, and Sm/Im galaxies for 3 metallicities and 2 Initial\nMass Functions (IMF) kindly provided by S. Charlot, and\ncalculated from the version GISSEL95 of the GISSEL\nevolutionary code (Bruzual & Charlot 1993). For earlytype galaxies, higher metallicities flatten the slope of the\ncontinua. Changing the IMFs induces no effect on the\ntemplates (Fig. 8, frame a). For late-type galaxies, the\nSalpeter IMF (Salpeter 1955) tends to produce bluer objects than the Scalo IMF (Miller & Scalo 1979), and the\nmetallicity effect is small (Fig. 8, frames b to d). The\nSa/Sb templates using a Salpeter IMF are very similar\nto the Sc/Sd templates using a Scalo IMF, and at the\nresolution of the LZT survey, they are nearly identical.\nAlternatively, the PEGASE package (Fioc & RoccaVolmerange 1997) allows us to generate a set of solar\nmetallicity spectra with different ages, different stellar formation rates (SFR) and different IMF taken from Rana\n& Basu (1992). Details can be found in Fioc & RoccaVolmerange (1997). Included in the PEGASE package is\nan atlas of templates of eight galaxy types. For the various spectral types (E, S0, Sa, etc...), the atlas provides 65\ntemplates from ages of 1 Myr to 16 Gyr; each age sequence\nis normalized so that the 13-Gyr templates fit present day\nSEDs of observed galaxies with solar metallicity.\nEven if true spectra cover a large range of metallicities and ages, the resolution R \u2243 40 of the LZT survey\ndoes not allow us to distinguish between a PEGASE young\nSa galaxy template and PEGASE old Sb, Sc, Sd or Im\ngalaxy template. Therefore, we include in the mock LZT\ncatalog only templates showing significant differences and\ninstead of using the ages given by PEGASE as true indicators of the evolution of galaxies with redshift, we use\nthem as indicators of the morphological sequence. Hence,\nfor elliptical galaxy SEDs, we use the 23 templates of the\nPEGASE atlas called E13 and older than 1 Gyr (the templates have a short SFR, followed by passive evolution).\nFor spiral galaxy SEDs, we use the 31 templates of the\nPEGASE atlas called Sa13, older than 350 Myr (we use a\n\nconstant SFR for spiral galaxies). Figure 9 shows several\nSa13 templates from the PEGASE library, shown at various ages. As already mentioned, the 13-Gyr-old template\nis fitted to a local Sa galaxy spectra with solar metallicity.\nWe interpret the ages sequence given by PEGASE Sa13\ntemplates as follows: late-type galaxies (Sc, Sd, Im) are\nmodeled by young Sa13 galaxy templates (with ages < 3\nGyr, 15 templates), and early-type galaxies (Sa, Sb) by old\nSa13 galaxy templates (with ages \u2265 3 Gyr, 16 templates).\nThere are notable differences between PEGASE and\nGISSEL elliptical galaxies in the UV, whereas spiral templates look alike in both models. We also emphasize that\nboth GISSEL and PEGASE packages rely on the stellar\nlibrary of Pickles which is noticeably deficient in AGB\nstars SEDs. AGB stars are still poorly known but represent a non-negligeable part of the total integrated flux of\ngalaxies.\nThe mock LZT galaxy catalogues are built using the\n(evolving) redshift distributions in Fig. 7. Early-type\ngalaxies are randomly extracted from the 12 GISSEL\nE/S0/Sa/Sb templates, the 23 PEGASE E13 templates,\nand the 16 Sa13 templates older than 3 Gyr. Late-type\ngalaxies are randomly extracted from the 12 GISSEL\nSc/Sd/Sm/Im templates, and the 15 PEGASE Sa13 templates younger than 3 Gyr. The number of early and latetype galaxies are those plotted in Fig. 7 as non-evolving\nearly-type and evolving late-type redshift distributions for\nthe LZT survey (see also Table 3).\n\n2.3.3. Emission-line galaxies\nWe do not model the emission lines in the galaxy SEDs,\nbecause in the medium-band filters used by the LZT, only\nthe brightest emission lines will be detected. At first order,\nan emission line will be detected only if\nT hreshold\nWline\n\u2265\n,\nWfilter\nS/N\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Wline is the line equivalent width, Wfilter is the filter bandwidth, T hreshold is the detection threshold in\nunits of standard deviation, and S/N is the signal-tonoise ratio. For T hreshold = 1, S/N = 3, and a typical Wfilter = 150\u00c5, the emission line must have Wline \u2265\n50\u00c5. Only QSOs and Seyfert galaxies reach this level of\nemission.\nWe emphasize that the analysis of the QSO sub-sample\nincluded in the LZT mock catalog (see next Sect.) demonstrates that strong emission lines contribute to improving\nthe object classification and the redshift determination\nwhich are obtained by the PCA. As seen in Fig. 14 and\ndescribed in Sect. 3.1 below, the PCA sequence of QSOs\nis clearly separated from the blue part of the stellar sequence, and this is caused by the strong emission lines\npresent in the QSO SEDs.\nAlthough Seyfert galaxies only represent a small fraction (5%) of the galaxy populations at low redshift\n(Reichert 1992), the fraction of galaxies with strong emission lines may be larger at z >\n\u223c 0.5. However, we consider\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n9\n\nFig. 8. Galaxy template spectra from GISSEL (Bruzual & Charlot 1993). In each frame, the Initial Mass Function\n(IMF) and metallicity of the spectra vary from top to bottom as follows: Salpeter IMF, with 20% solar, 40% solar,\nand solar metallicity; Scalo IMF, with 20% solar, 40% solar, and solar metallicity.\n\nthat it is not necessary to include them in the mock LZT\ncatalogues, as they have similar SEDs to QSOs, and would\ntherefore make a negligeable change to the PCA eigenbasis. Seyfert galaxies and other galaxies with strong emission lines would deviate from the locus of normal galaxies\nin the PCA, and would thus be easily identified; their red-\n\nshift would be measured with similar accuracy as for the\nQSOs (see Sect. 5). They could also be directly identified\nfrom their SEDs using a break-finding algorithm (Cabanac\net al. 1998), or a cross-correlation analysis (as shown by\npreliminary tests performed by R. Cabanac).\n\n\f10\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 9. Sa13 galaxy template spectra from PEGASE (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997). The age of the spectra are\ngiven in million years. The metallicity is adjusted to have a solar value for the 13-Gyr-old spectrum.\n\n2.4. Quasi-stellar objects\nThe third kind of objects included in the simulations are\nthe quasi-stellar objects (QSO). We use the preliminary\nresults of the on-going 2dF QSO Survey (Boyle et al.\n2000). The 2dF QSO survey has been optically selected in\nthe U , BJ and R bands from UKST photographic plates.\nThe BJ QSO LF is found to follow a pure luminosity evolution (Boyle et al. 2000) which can be modeled by\n\nWe assume the same analytical description for the R QSO\nLF, and choose to adopt for the simulations MR\u2217 \u2243 \u221221\nand \u03c6\u2217R = 10\u22126 Mpc\u22123 mag\u22121 , a \u223c 35% larger value than\ncalculated from the BJ 2dF survey (Boyle et al. 2000).\nEquation 3 can be rewritten in terms of absolute magnitude MR :\n\u03c6(MR , z)dMR =\n\n0.4ln(10)\u03a6\u2217RdMR\n,\nX 3.6\u22121 + X 1.8\u22121\n\u2217\n\n2\n\nX = 100.4[MR (0)\u2212MR ]\u22121.4z+0.27z .\n\u03c6(LB , z)dL = \u0014\n\n\u03c6\u2217B dL\n\u00153.6 \u0014\n\u00151.8\nLB\nLB\n+\nL\u2217B (z)\nL\u2217B (z)\n\n(3)\n\nwith\n\u0014\n\nL\u2217B (z)\nlog\nL\u2217B (0)\n\n\u0015\n\n= 1.4z \u2212 0.27z 2,\n\n(4)\n\nor equivalently\nMB\u2217 (z) = MB\u2217 (0) \u2212 2.5 (1.4z \u2212 0.27z 2),\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nWe assume that Eq. 6 is a reasonable prediction of the\nLZT QSO sample and we extrapolate the QSO LF to the\nLZT apparent magnitude limit of Rc \u2264 23. We also set a\nbright cut off at Rc = 15. The resulting redshift distribution in the interval 0 \u2264 z \u2264 4 is shown in Fig. 10.\nFigure 10 shows a composite QSO template derived\nfrom the LBQS sample (Francis et al. 1991), and a sample\nof 101 QSOs observed in the UV using HST (Zheng et al.\n1997). Because the QSO template provided by Francis et\nal. is bounded at 6000 \u00c5, and the LZT filters extend out to\n104 \u00c5, we approximate the missing continuum by a power-\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 10.

Composite QSO spectrum at z = 0 (Francis et al.\n1991). The wavelengths of the centers of the LZT filters\nare overlaid (\u25e6). At red wavelengths, the spectrum is extrapolated by a power-law from 6000 to 104 \u00c5, to which\nis added a synthetic H\u03b1 line. In the UV, the spectrum\nis completed with observations from HST (Zheng et al.\n1997).\n\nlaw in the range 6000-10 000 \u00c5. In the blue, the composite\nspectrum is bounded at 800 \u00c5. In order to define the U\nand blue LZT magnitudes for all QSOs with z \u2264 4, we extrapolate the spectrum to 300 \u00c5 at a constant flux. Note\nthat because of Lyman \u03b1 absorption, the continuum of\nthe spectrum is poorly defined at wavelengths bluer than\n\u223c 1200 \u00c5 (see Vanden Berk et al. 2001); this choice only\naffects QSOs with z \u2265 2.75, among which, only those with\nweak emission lines would be \"lost\" in the star sample. We\nalso add a synthetic H\u03b1 emission line whose intensity is\nrelated to the intensity of the H\u03b2 emission line already\npresent in the composite spectrum, according to the typi-\n\n11\n\ncal H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 line ratio of \u223c 4, obtained in models of broad\nline regions (Osterbrock 1989). A new composite spectra\nhas been made available by the SDSS consortium (Vanden\nBerk et al. 2001) while the present article was in the refereeing process. Because both the emission lines and the\ncontinua of the 2 composite spectra are remarkably similar, we did not update our simulations to include the SDSS\ncomposite spectrum: the wide spectral range of the SDSS\nspectrum would make no improvement to our analysis, as\nthe range covered by the 2dF composite spectrum used\nhere is sufficient to describe the full wavelength interval of\nthe LZT filters for QSOs with 0 <\n\u223cz<\n\u223c 4.\nThe integrated QSO number count per deg2 is extrapolated from the differential number counts in the 2dF QSO\nsurvey (Boyle et al. 2000). To a limiting apparent magnitude of R \u2264 23, the integrated count of QSOs per square\ndegree is \u223c 130. The mock LZT catalogues are generated\nfor 1 deg2 , hence each simulation is obtained by randomly\ndrawing 130 QSO templates with the same redshift distribution as in Fig. 10, and subsequently adding noise according to the LZT efficiency (see the next Sect.). The\nrange of signal-to-noise ratio in the continuum of the synthetic QSO spectra is 3 \u2212 100.\nBecause the number of QSOs is relatively small in our\nmock catalogues we decided to use only the composite\nSED of Francis without slope variations. Nevertheless, it\nis likely that the slopes of the continuum of real QSO\nSEDs vary around the mean slope of the composite SED\nof Francis. The effect of such a variation on the PCA would\nbe to spread the locus of QSOs from a line to a surface; the\narea of this surface would be related to the standard deviation in the variation of the slope. This variation could\ndegrade the identification of QSOs, because the flatter\nthe slopes, the higher the similarities between QSOs and\nemission-line galaxies. On the other hand, the measured\nredshift accuracies (Sect. 5) should not be affected by this\nsimplification.\n\n2.5. Noise\nPhoton noise and detector read-out noise are added to\nthe SED of each type of object according to the response\ncurve T (\u03bb) of the Large Zenith Telescope (LZT), defined\nas the product of the detector sensitivity curve CCD(\u03bb)\nby the transmission curve of the telescope/instrument optics O(\u03bb), and the sky transmission I(\u03bb):\nT (\u03bb) = I(\u03bb) O(\u03bb) CCD(\u03bb);\n\n(7)\n\nFor an object with intrinsic flux F0 (\u03bb), the final flux F (\u03bb)\nobtained after \"observing\" the object with the LZT telescope+instrument+detector and correcting it using an absolute flux calibration is\n\u0014\n\ngauss\nF (\u03bb) = F0 (\u03bb) 1 +\nS/N (\u03bb)\n\n\u0015\n\n(8)\n\n\f12\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nwith\nq\n\nT (\u03bb) Nnight\ng(\u03bb)\n\nF0 (\u03bb)\nS/N (\u03bb) = q\n,\nAsrc RON 2 g(\u03bb)\nF0 (\u03bb) + Asrc sky(\u03bb) + A\nT\n(\u03bb)\nN\npix\nnight\ng(\u03bb) =\n\n1020 hc\n.\n\u03bbc \u2206\u03bb \u2206t Amirror\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\ngauss is a gaussian random generator, with a null\nmean and a root-mean-square dispersion of 1, S/N (\u03bb)\nis the \"observed\" signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum F (\u03bb); sky(\u03bb) is a composite sky spectrum, using Kitt Peak night sky spectrum (Massey & Foltz\n2000), Mauna Kea KECK LRIS OH emission lines atlas (http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu), and GEMINI near\nIR modeled continuum (http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu).\nFigure 12 shows the composite high-resolution sky spectrum and its medium-band counterpart using the LZT\nfilters. In Eq. 9, Asrc is the area of the observed object in\narcsec2 on the detector, Apix = 0.245 arcsec2 is the area\nof one CCD pixel, RON = 11 e\u2212 is the CCD readout\nnoise. The function g(\u03bb) in Eq. 10 is the flux expressed in\nJoule/second/meter3 corresponding to one photon having\nthe central wavelength \u03bbc of the LZT filter considered (see\nFig. 1), arriving on the detector per exposure time \u2206t and\nper wavelength interval \u2206\u03bb (of the considered filter), given\nthe area of the LZT mirror Amirror = 28.3 m2 (wavelengths\nare expressed in meters, time in seconds); hc = 1.992\u221225\nJ*m is the product of the Planck constant by the speed of\nlight. Because the LZT is operated in drift-scan mode, the\nexposure time is fixed to \u2206t = 65 sec. The exposure time\nis effectively increased by observing a given region of the\nsurvey in a given filter during several nights Nnight (see\nEq. 9).\nThe number of optical surfaces in the telescope/instrument combination is 11: the mirror (80% reflectivity), and 4 lenses plus the CCD window (98% transmission is assumed for each of the 10 surfaces). For simplicity the transmission is supposed to be achromatic. The\nLZT total efficiency curve T (\u03bb) has a bell-shape between\n3000\u00c5 and 10000\u00c5, with a flat maximum transmission of\n0.65 running from 5000\u00c5 to 8000\u00c5. Figure 13 shows the\nS/N (\u03bb) calculated using Eq. 9 for an O5V star, a G0V\nstar and an M6V star, with their lowest signal-to-noise\nratio set to 3.35: this corresponds to the overall signal-tonoise ratio obtained from 5 contiguous pixels having each\na signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5. Note that we choose such\na low detection level per pixel in order to test the PCA.\nGiven the LZT median seeing of 0.9 arcsec FWHM (FullWidth-Half-Maximum), we do not expect stars to be less\nextended than 5 pixels, as it corresponds to the area of\na disk of 1.2-arcsec diameter projected onto CCD pixels\nwith an area Apix = 0.245 arcsec2 . We thus adopt the limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 3.35 as our detection threshold for the LZT mock catalog. For galaxies at z \u2243 0.5, a\ntypical FWHM of 3 arcsec (see Sect. 4.1) yields an area\nof 28.8 pixels, and a detection threshold of S/N = 1.5 per\npixel yields an overall S/N \u223c 8.\n\nFig. 12. Composite sky spectrum using Kitt\nPeak night sky spectrum (Massey & Foltz 2000),\nMauna Kea KECK LRIS OH emission lines atlas\n(http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu), and GEMINI near IR\nmodeled continuum (http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu).\nThe filled diamonds are the LZT U+medium-band filter\nfluxes used for noise computations.\n\nWe also define the overall signal-to-noise of each spectrum as the median value of S/N (\u03bb) over the 41 LZT\nfilters. For the spectra in fig. 13, these median S/N are\n44 (O5V), 14 (G0V), and 122 (M6V). Figure 13 therefore illustrates that very blue or very red spectra must\nhave a high median S/N to be detected over the entire\nrange of the LZT filters. To simplify the analysis and interpretation, the SEDs of all classes/types of objects in a\ngiven mock catalog are set to the same median signal-tonoise ratio. Mock catalogues are generated such that only\nobjects with a lower filter above the threshold limit of\nS/N (\u03bb) = 3.35 and median signal-to-noise ratio equal to\na given value are included: any object having at least one\nfilter with a S/N (\u03bb) < 3.35 is therefore not included in the\ncatalog. Catalogues with median signal-to-noise ratios of\n100, 20, 10, and 6 are used for the analysis reported here.\nIn the following Sects., the labels S/N always refer to the\nmedian signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra in the mock\ncatalogue considered. As shown in Fig. 13, we emphasize\nthat at a median S/N ratio of 100, the bluest objects will\nhave a signal-to-noise ratio of \u223c 10 in their reddest filters,\nwhereas the reddest objects will have a signal-to-noise ratio of \u223c 3 in their bluest filters; for flat-spectrum objects,\nthe range of signal-to-noise ratio described by the spectra\nwill be narrower.\n\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Principal Component Analysis\nFor a detailed description of the PCA, the reader is\nreferred to the books of Murtagh & Heck (1987) or\nKendall (1972), and to the seminal paper of Connolly\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n13\n\nTable 4. Eigenvalues \u03b3j of a typical PCA derived eigenbasis e from a LZT mock catalog which contains a mix\nof 3368 stars, 11600 galaxies and 170 QSO SEDs with\nS/N = 100, as described in Sect. 2.

(1995b). In this section we outline the results of\nPCA and develop the classification method.\nFollowing Connolly et al. (1995b), consider a set f of N\nvectors fi of M elements f\u03bbi , i \u2208 {1 . . . N }, \u03bb \u2208 {1 . . . M },\nnormalized to have unit scalar products [fi * fi ]1/2 = 1.\nIn our case, M is the number of filters: M = 41. The\nPCA derives a set of min(N, M ) orthogonal eigenvectors\nej (that is M = 41 eigenvectors in the present case, as\nN \u226b M ), using criteria of decreasing maximum variance\nof the spectra when projected onto the eigenvectors. Each\nvector fi can be written as a linear combination of ej :\n\nf\u03bbi =\n\nM\nX\n\nyij e\u03bbj ,\n\n(11)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere yij , denoted eigencomponent, is the weight of the\njth eigenvector in the ith vector. The first eigenvector e1\nis the mean vector over the f\u03bbi .

The PCA therefore provides a powerful filter for the set f (see Galaz and de Lapparent, 1998). For\nillustration, Table 4 shows the eigenvalues \u03b3j of a PCA\nperformed on one mock LZT catalog described in Sect. 2.\nAs shown by Connolly et al. (1995b), each eigenvalue \u03b3j is\nthe contribution of the corresponding eigenvector ej to the\nvariance of the set f , and therefore describes the relative\npower of each eigenvector in the dataset (one can intuitively realize that if all vectors have similar directions,\nthey can be described by a small number of components).\nThe power Pj carried by each eigenvector ej can be measured as\n\u03b3j\nPj = PM\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b3j\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nTable 4 therefore shows that the first 3 eigenvectors e1 , e2 ,\ne3 carry 87.6%, 9%, 2.2% resp. of the descriptive power;\nthe sum of these 3 contributions yields 98.8%, and adding\ne4 increases the summed contributions to 99.3%. This\nmeans that the first 3 vectors actually carry most of the\ninformation and, to a good approximation, the weights of\nthe other eigenvectors may be neglected. This is the reason why only the first 3 or 4 eigencomponents are usually\nkept to describe a set of galaxies at z = 0 (Ronen et al.\n1999).\nOur case is more complex because we have to analyze\na catalog containing different classes of objects, which in\naddition span different redshift intervals, hence showing\n\n\f14\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 14.

One must reach 9 components to restore the full de-\n\ntails of the LZT mock samples. We therefore choose to\nperform the analysis of the LZT mock catalogues with a\n10-eigencomponent PCA, as the remaining power after the\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n10th component just reaches below 0.1% (see Table 4 and\nEq. 12).

The last\ngraph shows the corresponding first 4 eigenvectors; the\ncorresponding relative powers which they carry are indicated in the graph. Stars (stars) galaxies (dotted lines)\nand QSOs (open circles) occupy well-defined regions of\nthe 4-D space described by the first 4 eigenvectors e1 , e2 ,\ne3 , and e4 (see frames b & d). As shown by Connolly et al.\n(1995b) and Galaz & de Lapparent (1998), using the first\n3 eigencomponents, the stellar spectral sequence (shown\nwith asterisks) describes an arc, with later type being at\nlower values of y2 . The stellar spectral types of selected\nstars are indicated in each graph. O, B, and A stars have\npositive values of y2 , whereas M stars have negative values of y2 . The other spectral types fill the sequence. The\ngalaxies (plotted as dots) describe a 2-D surface, starting\nfrom the stellar sequence at low redshift, and extending\naway from it along the paths generated by a redshift step\nof 0.01. The higher redshift considered for the galaxies is\n\u223c 2. The QSOs (open circles) describe a linear sequence\ndefined by their redshift (1 \u2264 z \u2264 4). The QSO sequence\nis distinct from the stellar sequence at low redshift, and\nmerges with it at z \u223c 3 (see Sect. 4.2); at this redshift, a\nQSO cannot be distinguished from an F star.\nTherefore, the PCA not only provides a spectral classification within each class of object (stars, galaxies, QSOs)\nbut also allows a classification scheme by which the 3\nclasses of objects can be distinguished. The definition of\nthe different spectral types for each class of object can be\ndone by parameterization of the 1-D or 2-D surfaces they\ndescribe. This is developed in Sect. 3.3.\n\n3.2. The spectral classification\nBecause the PCA is a non-parametric approach, the eigenvectors derived for one catalog are specific and maybe inappropriate for another catalog. In order to use the PCA\nfor spectral classification, one must relate the internal correlations outlined by the PCA with the physical properties of the objects. The canonical but subjective method to\nachieve this purpose, is to create realistic mock catalogues\nof templates and apply the PCA to them. Previous works\nby Connolly et al. (1995a); Connolly & Szalay (1999),\nGalaz & de Lapparent (1998) and Ronen et al. (1999)\nestablish the efficiency of the PCA to produce an internal classification scheme related to physical properties of\ngalaxies. For instance, Galaz & de Lapparent (1998) use\nthe first 3 eigencomponents yi1 , yi2 , and yi3 as Cartesian\ncoordinates of a 3-D space, and convert them into the\n2 angles defining the corresponding spherical coordinates\nwhich are in turn used for the classification: one param-\n\n15\n\neter is related to the color of the objects, i.e. the slope\nof the continua, and the other is an index of the intensity of the emission lines. Ronen et al. (1999) show by\nusing stellar synthesis galaxy template spectra that one\ncan track down some properties such as the age or the\nmetallicity. The weakness of the method of Ronen et al.\nis that when the stellar synthesis models reproduce the\nobserved spectra but are physically wrong, the derived\nphysical properties are erroneous. A successful approach\nshould include a direct calibration of the PCA on observed\nspectra with known types, ages, and metallicities (Galaz\n& de Lapparent 1998).\nAs pointed out by Connolly et al. (1995b), the PCA\neigenvectors and corresponding eigencomponents are determined by the relative numbers of the different types of\nobjects. Connolly et al. (1995b) introduce a morphological\ntype normalization to account for this relative proportion\nof objects when catalogues with unrealistic proportions\nare used. Here, we prefer the direct approach of using realistic mock catalogues (see Sect. 2) which will be directly\ncomparable to the LZT catalog.\nThe PCA applied to the mock LZT catalogues is used\nhere to extract the relevant information for classifying\nobjects and measuring their redshifts (for galaxies and\nQSOs). We choose a simple approach. Once the principal\neigencomponents of the mock catalog are measured, we select the first 10 eigenvectors and define a 10-dimensional\neigenbasis, in which each class of object occupies a given\nlocus, defined by it spectral type among its class, and\nits redshift for galaxies and QSOs. As the paths followed\nby the galaxies and QSO are monotonic functions of redshift, the PCA provides a template-independent method\nfor measuring redshifts. Except for the redshift/spectraltype degeneracies discussed in Sect. 6.1, similar types of\nobjects at similar redshifts (for galaxies and QSOs) tend\nto be nearby in the space defined by the 10-dimensional\neigenbasis, thus providing a unique parameterization of a\ngiven SED. In the following, we describe how the object\nclasses and types are defined and how the redshifts are\nmeasured.\n\n3.3. Definition and measurement of object/spectral\ntypes\nWe define object classes (star, galaxy, QSO) and types\n(O to M for stars, E to Irr for galaxies) by assigning to\neach template a number T . For stars, the 131 Pickles templates spanning the range of stellar types O to M and luminosities I to V are ordered from blue to red and are\nassigned types T \u2208 {1, 2, ..., 131}. Galaxies are also ordered from blue to red as follows: the 12 GISSEL latetype templates (see Sect. 2.3.2); the 27 PEGASE latetype templates; the 12 GISSEL early-type templates; the\n27 PEGASE early-type templates; these 78 spectra are assigned types T \u2208 {132, 133, ..., 209}. QSOs are all assigned\nT = 210, as only one type of spectrum was used.\n\n\f16\n\nCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nGiven the SED o\u03bb of an object.

Table 5\ndemonstrates that in all cases, the most accurate results\nare obtained for \u03b7 = 1, i.e. the nearest neighbor is always the best choice. The efficiency of the classification is\nfurther described in Sect. 4.\nNote that in the nearest neighbor analysis used here,\nthe effect of the input S/N onto the eigencomponents yi\nis not accounted for. Table 5 suggests that the effect on\nthe classification would be negligeable (as almost no errors\noccur even for large values of \u03b7). The effect on the type\nand redshift determination would be larger, and we refer\nthe reader to Sect. 6.1 for a more general discussion.\n\n3.4. Measurement of redshifts\nBecause we apply the PCA to the observed SEDs, it is possible to measure redshifts directly with a technique similar\nto the classification method (Sect. 3.2). In the 10-D space\ndefined by the first 10 eigenvectors, galaxies and quasars\nfollow redshift sequences. We define the redshift zo of an\nunknown object as the average redshift z\u0304 of the \u03b7 nearest\nneighbors from the mock catalog which lie inside a radius\nr\u03b7 and have type Tobject \u00b1 5:\nzo = z\u0304 =\n\n\u03b7\n1 X Tobject\n;\nzy\n\u03b7 i=1 i\n\n(17)\n\n\u03b7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10\n\n\u03b7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10\n\n\u03b7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10\n\nr\u03b7 is defined by \u03b7 and has the same unit as d (Eq. 15),\nand therefore, as the eigencomponents yi (see Eq. 11 and\nFig. 14). The value of r\u03b7 is usually small: for \u03b7 = 10, we\nestimate r\u03b7 <\n\u223c 0.05 for the 3 classes of object. If more\nthan one class is present among the \u03b7 neighbors, i.e. if the\nobject falls in a locus containing a mix of various classes,\nthe class is not robustly defined and the average redshift\nis given for all classes inside r\u03b7 . Our mock catalog is such\nthat for 98% of the galaxies, the redshift accuracy is not\nstrongly dependent on \u03b7 for \u03b7 < 5, and for 90% of the\nQSOs, \u03b7 = 1, i.e., the nearest neighbor always provides\na more accurate redshift than the average over a group\nof objects (the remaining 2% galaxies and 10% QSOs are\naffected by degeneracies in redshifts, which are described\nin Sect. 6.1).\n\n4. Star/galaxy/QSO separation\nIn this section we examine quantitatively how the separation of stars, galaxies and QSOs can be performed using\nthe PCA, and how the object profile can contribute to the\nanalysis.\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nFig. 15.

Extended versus unresolved objects\n\n.\nMedian S/N\n\nIn an Einstein-de Sitter universe, the angular size \u03b8 of an\nobject with physical size D is\n\u03b8(z) = (DH0 /2c)(1 + z)2 [(1 + z) \u2212 (1 + z)1/2 ]\u22121\n\n17\n\n(18)\n\n100\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere c = 300, 000 km s , and H0 is the Hubble constant.\nFollowing Sandage, Kron & Longair Sandage et al. (1995),\na typical disk galaxy has an effective diameter of D = 10\nkpc, which results in an angular size \u03b8(z = 0.25) = 4.09\u2032\u2032 ;\nthis value assumes a mean surface brightness in Johnson\nV band \u03bcV = 23.5 mag*arcsec\u22122, and an exponential disk\nprofile (see Table 6.2, p. 283, in Sandage, Kron & Longair,\n1995). For \u03bcV = 25.1 mag*arcsec\u22122, the angular size \u03b8(z =\n0.5) = 2.8\u2032\u2032 . Hence, most of bright galaxies at z <\n\u223c 0.5\nare expected to be more extended than the PSF of the\nLZT (\u223c 1 \u2212 2\u2032\u2032 ), and potential confusion between star and\ngalaxy SEDs is not expected to occur beyond redshift 0.2.\nAt redshifts higher than 0.2, the PCA is indeed robust\nto segregate stars from galaxies due to the red-shifting of\nthe galaxy SEDs. Only compact galaxies at low redshifts\n(z <\n\u223c 0.2) might be intrinsically difficult to distinguish\nfrom stars in the medium-band system of the LZT. So\nfar there is no evidence for a dominating population of\ncompact galaxies at these redshifts. Moreover, the fraction\nof galaxies in the predicted LZT redshift distribution of\nFig. 7 lying at z \u2264 0.2 is \u223c 10%, a non-negligeable but\nminor component of the full sample.\n\n20\n\n10\n\n6\n\nInput\nclass\nStars\nGalaxies\nQSOs\nStars\nGalaxies\nQSOs\nStars\nGalaxies\nQSOs\nStars\nGalaxies\nQSOs\n\na\n\n#\n3181\n2993\n984\n2843\n2993\n984\n2092\n2993\n984\n1956\n2095\n741\n\nClassification # b\nStars Galaxies QSOs\n3181\n0\n0\n0\n2993\n0\n0\n0\n984\n2833\n10\n0\n0\n2993\n0\n0\n0\n984\n2092\n0\n0\n0\n2993\n0\n6\n0\n978\n1923\n0\n33\n0\n2095\n0\n42\n9\n690\n\na\n\nInput number of objects in each class\nOutput number of stars, galaxies, and QSOs derived by the\n10-component PCA\nb\n\n4.2. PCA classification efficiency\nOne key parameter in determining the efficiency of the\nPCA classification is the signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra. Figure 15 shows a 3D plot of the first 3 eigencomponents of the PCA performed on mock catalogues containing 33,486 objects (3370 stars, 29,986 galaxies and 130\nQSOs) and a median signal-to-noise ratio S/N \u2243 100 (see\nSect. 2.5).

In Fig. 16, the mock catalog of Fig. 15 is degraded\nto a median signal-to-noise ratio S/N \u2243 20. In both Figs.,\nstars, galaxies and QSOs occupy different loci in the 3Dspace, therefore allowing us to separate objectively the 3\nclasses of objects, and illustrating how the PCA is robust\nto noise.\nTable 6 compiles the efficiency of the classification as\na function of signal-to-noise ratio for a small mock catalog\ndescribed in Sect. 5 below. Following the previous Sect.,\nwe assume that the 1347 galaxies at z <\n\u223c 0.5 are extended,\nand thus can be separated from stars using morphological criteria. The remaining 1646 galaxies at z >\n\u223c 0.5 are\nseparated from stars and QSOs using Eq. 16. For a median S/N = 100, the object classification is perfect, and\nalthough it slowly degrades as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases, the performance of the classification are weakly\ndependent on the signal-to-noise ratio.\nTable 6 shows that QSO SEDs tend to be misclassified\nas stellar SEDs (6% of QSOs at a median signal-to-noise\nratio of 6). There is no degeneracy between blue stars\n(O, B or white dwarfs) and low-redshift QSOs, because\nblue stars have no emission lines; QSOs are thus clearly\nsegregated. In the range 2.5 < z < 3, QSO and F/G\nstellar SEDs are similar. For z >\n\u223c 3.5, QSO signatures are\nunique again and misclassification is rare. Unfortunately,\nthe range 2.5 < z < 3 corresponds to the peak of the\nexpected QSO distribution (see Sect. 2.4). This explains\nwhy such a large fraction of QSOs are misclassified as\nstars for median S/N = 6. This outlines a weakness of\nthis classification method, the solution of which probably\nlies in a slightly different approach which we discuss in\nSect. 6.\n\n4.3. PCA type identifications\nTable 7 allows us to evaluate the accuracies in the type\nidentifications for the 2 classes of objects having types\n(stars and galaxies). The accuracies are measured by the\n\ndifference between the real type and the PCA-measured\ntype, as in Table 5. For galaxies, an error of \u00b110 on\nthe type leads to a catastrophic error in redshift in 1/3\nof the cases, and an error of \u00b115 or more leads systematically to a catastrophic error in redshift. Table 7\nshows the results for the 4 median signal-to-noise ratios\nS/N = 100, 20, 10, 6.\nAt a median S/N = 100, the PCA is able to discriminate O,B,A,F,G,K,M star types and most luminosity and\nmetallicity classes. At a median S/N = 20, metallicity\ndifferences within each stellar type are no longer discriminated, and the luminosity class I, II, III, IV, V is often\nmismatched. At a median S/N = 10 and lower, only major continuum differences allow one to discriminate between different stellar types. Table 7 shows that even at\nS/N = 6, the PCA is able to discriminate types for half\nof the objects within each class.\n\n5. Redshift measurement accuracy\nIn order to test the accuracy of the measurement of redshifts with the PCA, we must make a prior hypothesis that\nthe mock catalog is a fair representation of real observations. In that case, it is acceptable to compare sub-samples\nof the main catalog to itself, for different S/N ratio to verify that we can recover physical information (here, the redshift). In other words, internal errors will be a good representation of the errors. On the other hand, if the mock catalog is not a fair simulation of the observations, additional\nsystematic errors will degrade the measured accuracy. The\nunderlying motivation for using sub-samples of the mock\ncatalog (denoted \"sub-mock\" catalogues hereafter) is obviously to save computing time. Keeping this remark in\nmind, we generate small mock catalogues of galaxy SEDs\naccording to the procedure described in Sect. 2. The small\nmock catalogues contain \u223c 3000 stars, \u223c 3000 galaxies\nand \u223c 1000 QSOs. We then project the SEDs onto the first\n10 eigenspectra derived from PCAs made on mock catalogues with realistic proportions of stars, galaxies QSOs\n(\u223c 3000 stars, \u223c 30 000 galaxies, \u223c 1000 QSOs), and with\na median signal-to-noise ratio S/N = 100. The resulting\n10 eigencomponents of each SED are compared to the corresponding eigencomponents of the realistic mock catalog\nusing the least-square technique described in Sect. 3 (Eqs.\n15 and 17).\nFigure 17 (frames labeled \"ALL\") shows the residuals in the redshift measurement and Tables 8 to 11 show\nthe standard deviations in the residuals of measured redshifts versus input redshifts, as a function of redshift using\nall galaxy templates available (54 PEGASE templates, 24\nGISSEL templates). In order to evaluate the impact on the\nerror budget of using different templates for the galaxy\nSEDs, we restrict the sub-mock catalogues, whereas the\neigenbasis on which the various sub-samples are projected\nremains unchanged and contains all 54 PEGASE templates and 24 GISSEL templates. For each median signalto-noise value, we generate sub-mock catalogues using for\ngalaxies: only the 24 GISSEL templates (Tables 8 to 11,\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n19\n\nFig. 17. Redshift residuals versus input redshift extracted from a \u03c72 reduction of the first 10 PCA eigencomponents.\nIn each frame, spectra in sub-mock catalogues are projected onto realistic mock simulations with a median signalto-noise ratio of S/N = 100. \u00bfFrom top to bottom, in addition to \u223c 3000 stars and \u223c 1000 QSOs, the sub-mock\ncalatogues include \u223c 3000 galaxy SEDs drawn respectively from only the 78 galaxy templates of PEGASE+GISSEL\n(ALL), from only the 24 galaxy templates of GISSEL, from only the 54 PEGASE templates (PEGASE), and from only\nthe 31 PEGASE Sa13 templates (Sa13). In all frames, only QSOs have redshifts z > 2. The corresponding standard\ndeviations are listed in Tables 8 to 11.\n\nand frames labeled \"GISSEL\" in Fig. 17); only the 54\nPEGASE templates (Tables 8 to 11, and frames labeled\n\"PEGASE\" in Fig. 17); only the 31 Sa13 PEGASE templates (Tables 8 to 11, Cols. labeled \"PEGASE Sa13\", and\nframes labeled Sa13 in Fig. 17).

(1994) using a \u03c72 adjustment of mock LZT galaxy SEDs onto the PEGASE\ntemplates; in contrast to the results of Hickson et al.\n(1994), the dispersion in the PCA redshift residuals increases monotonically with redshift. Tables 8 to 11 also\nshow that the intense emission lines present in the QSOs\nallow us to measure redshifts at all signal-to-noise ratios.\nThe problem of possible misclassification of QSO as stars,\nmentioned in Sect. 4.2, only affects the completeness of the\nsample, but does not affect the quality of redshift measurements.\nThe similar redshift residuals for the 4 types of submock catalogues (ALL, GISSEL, PEGASE, PEGASE\nSa13 in Table 8, 9, 10 and 11) may appear surprising,\nas one would expect more degeneracy when simulations\ninclude independent models of template SEDs. However,\nwe project the sub-mock catalogues onto the full realistic\n\ncatalog, which includes all template SEDs. An interesting\ntest is to measure, for instance, redshifts from a GISSEL\nsimulation using a PCA calculated from a PEGASE-based\nmock catalog, and to examine whether significant errors\noccur. Table 12 shows the systematic error thus introduced\nin the measurement of redshifts for signal-to-noise ratios\nS/N = 100, 20, 10, and 6; Fig. 18 shows the measured\n(\"observed\") redshift versus the true redshift (\"theoretical\") for S/N = 20. The standard deviation \u03c3Res. in the\nresiduals rises by an order of magnitude for S/N = 100\ncompared to the results in Table 8, and the average deviations show a systematic negative offset. For lower signalto-noise ratios (S/N = 20, 10, 6), the degradation in the\nredshift measurement is less marked as the S/N decreases,\nas expected; the systematic negative offset persists and is\nlargest for S/N = 6. Table 13 shows the classification efficiency for this simulation: a significant 6.6% of galaxies\nare misidentified as stars at a median S/N = 100 and 3%\nat a median S/N = 20.

Instead of performing\nthe PCA onto the observed sample, a better method is\nto calculate the eigenvectors from a mock catalog with\nthe widest variety of galaxy, QSO, and stellar SEDs, together with a realistic mix of the different object types\nand realistic redshift distributions. This was attempted\nwith the mock catalogues generated here. However, the\nsystematic differences between the GISSEL and PEGASE\ntemplates show that improved models of spectral libraries\nare needed.\n\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Degeneracy in PCA\nWe now examine the problem of degeneracies in the PCA,\nwhich is particularly acute when too few eigencomponents\nare used. Figures 19, 20, and 21 illustrate the limit of reconstructing SEDs using only the first 4 eigencomponents\nof the PCA. Figures 19 and 20 show LZT SEDs of galaxies which have different redshifts but similar continua. In\nprinciples, the spectra should be clearly distinguishable\nusing their local features. But the 4-component PCA classifies them as \"similar\" spectra, hence introducing a large\nerror in the redshift measurement. Using Eq. 17, the PCA\nmeasures z = 0.354 for the pair of SEDs in Fig. 19, which\nhave true redshifts z = 0.354, z = 0.274, and z = 0.204\nfor the pair in Fig. 20, with true redshifts z = 0.204,\nz = 0.064.

SEDs of 2 PEGASE galaxies viewed through the\nLZT filter system (see Fig. 1), with intermediate S/N ,\nand different ages and redshifts: E with age 1.8 Gy, and\nz = 0.800 (solid line),and Sa with age 12 Gy and z =\n0.688 (dot-dashed line); both have similar metallicities and\nIMF of Kroupa Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange (1997). The\n2 SEDs are clearly distinguishable as well as the PCA\nreconstructions in Fig. 23.\n\nFig. 21. The reconstructed SEDs using the first 4 components of the PCA are shown for the 4 galaxies of Fig.\n19 and 20 using the same line types. Differentiating between the 2 SAB galaxies, resp. between the Sa and the\nE galaxy, is intrinsically difficult.\n\nS/N = 10 were 3 times larger than those obtained with\nthe 10-component PCA at the same S/N ratio (see Table\n10).\nThe problem of degeneracies when trying to measure\nredshifts using the PCA is linked to an intrinsic limit of\nthe technique. The PCA is powerful for filtering the noise\nin observed spectra, for extracting both the common features and the major source of variance among an ensemble of SEDs. In the case of galaxy SED's at zero redshift,\nthe PCA is well suited for accurate classification, as the\ncommon features of the spectra are the underlying stellar\npopulations and the characteristic emission and absorption lines associated with them. In the present case, the\nmix of redshifts which cover a large interval (0 <\n\u223cz <\n\u223c2\nfor galaxies) introduces a vast variety of continuum shapes\namong the SEDs and the dominant eigencomponents of\nthe resulting PCA emphasize the continuum over local\nfeatures, which are common to only a few objects (those\nat the same redshift).\n\nFig. 23. Reconstruction of the templates shown in Fig. 22\nusing 10 eigencomponents of a PCA mock catalog. High\nsignal-to-noise ratio spectra projected onto such a PCA\nwould allow us to differentiate the 2 reconstructions, but\nlow signal-to-noise SEDs would be indistinguishable.\n\nMost of the degeneracies are resolved when using 10\neigencomponents instead of 4, because 10 components allow one to reproduce the main absorption bands and discontinuities through the entire range of redshifts. Figures\n22 and 23 illustrate the description improvement of a 10eigencomponents analysis. Figure 22 shows a PEGASE E\ntemplate of 1.8 Gy at a redshift z = 0.8 (solid line) superposed on a PEGASE Sa spiral template of 12 Gy at a\nredshift z = 0.688 (dot-dashed line). Figure 23 shows the\nPCA reconstruction of the same templates using 10 eigencomponents. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra would be\ndistinguishable whereas low signal-to-noise spectra might\nbe misclassified.\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\n25\n\nFig. 24. Comparison of the input redshifts zmodel of a\nsimulated catalog and the photometric redshift estimation zphot from HYPERZ code (Bolzonella et al. 2000)\nwhen using the LZT 40 medium-band filters. The redshift\nsequence is tight at all redshifts showing only a small degeneracy near redshift 2.\n\nFig. 25. Same as in Fig. 25 using BV RI broad-band filters. This figure is reproduced from Fig. 2 of (Bolzonella\net al. 2000); dotted lines correspond to \u2206z = 0.2, dashed\nlines to \u2206z = 0.5, and thin solid lines to \u2206z = 1, where\nDeltaz = |zmodel \u2212 zphot |. Conspicuous degeneracies appear along the redshift sequence.\n\nSuch degeneracies have however a weak impact on the\noverall performances of the PCA technique as indicated\nin Tables 9 to 11. Catastrophic degeneracies in redshift\naffect only 2% of the galaxies, and 10% of the QSOs at all\nsignal-to-noise ratios considered; these fractions are calculated as the fractions of objects in each class for which\nthe difference between the input and measured redshift is\nlarger than the quadrature sum of the redshift residuals\ncorresponding to the 2 redshift values (listed in Tables 9\u2013\n11). As the degeneracy sometimes only affect the redshift\nand not the spectral type (see Fig. 19), the degeneracies\nin redshift yield degeneracies in spectral type for only a\nsub-fraction of the objects.\nNote that if the catalog used to calculate the PCA is\ndifferent from the observed catalog for which the classification, type and redshift measurement are planned to be\nperformed, a pre-requisite is to introduce in the source\ncatalog for the PCA similar error functions as in the data.\nProjecting an observed catalog with high signal-to-noise\nratio, onto a PCA calculated from low signal-to-noise spectra would merely result in the loss of information present\nin the data.

The model\ncatalog of SEDs was kindly provided by R. Pell\u00f3 and is\ndescribed in Bolzonella et al. (2000): it contains the SEDs\nwith a S/N = 10 of 1000 galaxies generated using version GISSEL98 of the GISSEL spectral library (Bruzual\nand Charlot, 1993; see Sect. 2.3.2). This sample was then\n\"observed\" through the LZT filters. Figure 24 shows a\ncomparison between the input redshifts zmodel of the resulting catalog with their photometric estimation zphot .\nIn the redshift range of interest for the LZT galaxies\n(0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5), the r.m.s. dispersion in the redshifts errors\n\u2206z = |zphot \u2212 zmodel| (after rejection of the few \"catastrophic detections\", defined by \u2206z \u2265 1, and occurring\nonly at z \u2264 0.5), is 0.036 in the interval 0 \u2264 z \u2264 0.5,\n0.018 in the interval 0.5 \u2264 z \u2264 1.0, 0.033 in the interval\n1.0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5. Note that these dispersions are comparable\nwith the values obtained with the PCA in the full redshift\nrange 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5 (see Table 10).\nFor comparison, we replicate in Fig. 25, the BV RI\npanel of Fig. 2 from Bolzonella et al. (2000), showing the\ndispersion in the photometric redshifts calculated from\nbroad-band magnitudes with an uncertainty \u2206m = 0.1\n(which approximately matches the S/N = 10 in the LZT\nSEDs used in Fig. 24): in the redshift range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5,\nthe r.m.s. uncertainty in zphot is in the range 0.2 \u2212 0.3 (see\nTable 2 of Bolzonella et al. 2000), 10 times larger than with\nthe LZT filters. The variance in the redshifts error is also\ncalculated after rejection of the \"catastrophic detections\"\nwith \u2206z \u2265 1. These correspond to analogous degeneracies as those described here in Sect. 6.1, and mainly occur\nin the redshift intervals 0 \u2264 z \u2264 0.4 et 1.5 \u2264 z \u2264 4.5.\nWe emphasize that the PCA-measured redshift sequence\nin Fig. 24 is much cleaner than that obtained with the\nbroad-band filters in Fig. 25. As both sets of filters span\nthe same wavelength range, this comparison provides a\ndirect demonstration of the general advantage of using\n\n6.2. Comparison with photometric redshifts\nThe galaxy redshift accuracy \u03c3Res. \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.05 (for\nmedian S/N \u2265 10) obtained here with the PCA should\nnot be attributed to the PCA technique itself, but to the\ndense sampling of the SEDs by the LZT medium-band\nfilters (note that \u03c3Res. \u223c 1/R with the LZT filter resolution R \u2243 40, see Fig. 1). We illustrate this point by\nusing another method to measure the redshifts of \"LZTobserved\" galaxies.

(2001), with a moderate gain in redshift\naccuracy (the error is decreased by 34% for z \u2264 1.3).\n\n6.3. Improvements\nThe measurements of physical parameters using LZT\nSEDs might be improved by complementing the PCA\nwith a \u03c72 technique for measuring the redshifts. Based\non spectral libraries such as those used here, a \u03c72 analysis measures redshifts to \u03c3Res. <\n\u223c 0.02 at z <\n\u223c 1 for\nS/N = 10 (Hickson et al. 1994). It is however very sensitive to the noise in the SEDs, as it makes use of all the\ninformation carried in them. This approach also provides\na way to perform the object classification (note that at\nredshift z <\n\u223c 0.5, comparison of the object profiles with\nthe point-spread-function could be used for differentiating\nstars from galaxies, as discussed in Sect. 4.1). One could\nuse the \u03c72 technique to control the redshifts calculated\nby the 10-component PCA, and thus identify the degenerate SEDs for which better redshifts could be measured.\nAlternatively, one could consider a 2-step analysis in which\nthe \u03c72 technique is first applied to the observed SEDs in\norder to measure their redshifts, and in a second step,\nthe PCA is applied to the SEDs \"blue-shifted\" to z = 0,\nwith the goal to obtain a reliable spectral classification for\nthe identified objects, and to generate \"noiseless\" reconstructed SEDs. An iterative process using both techniques\nmight be required and would contribute to improving the\nobject classification and redshift measurement.\nBecause observing objects at widely different redshifts\nresults in rest-wavelength SEDs covering differing wavelength intervals. The basic PCA technique described above\nand requiring that objects are covered by a common wavelength interval, could not be used on the SEDs \"blueshifted\" to z = 0. One could consider performing separate PCAs on sub-samples of rest-wavelength SEDs selected by redshift interval. Studying the evolution of the\ngalaxy populations with redshift would however require\nto compare the SEDs at different redshift over a common\nwavelength interval. A technique, recently developed by\nConnolly and co-workers, uses the reconstructing ability of\nthe PCA to fill the gaps in data with varying wavelengths\nintervals (Connolly & Szalay 1999). A complementary approach which creates the spectral templates from multicolor surveys (Budav\u00e1ri et al. 2000) could also be applied.\nOverall, the resulting PCA would allow both a reliable\nspectral classification of all objects, and reconstruction of\nthe missing regions of the spectra under the null-evolution\nhypothesis (which the PCA would implicitly do). By comparison of how the different spectral types are populated\nat different redshifts, such a PCA would allow one to ex-\n\namine and quantify the redshift evolution of the galaxy\npopulation.\n\n7. Conclusion\nThis paper describes an application of Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) to a simulated multicolor\nsurvey using the 40 medium-band filters of the Large\nZenith Telescope. For that purpose, we generate realistic mock catalogues of \u223c 3000 stars, \u223c 30 000 galaxies,\nand \u223c 1 000 QSOs. For stars, we use templates from the\nlibrary of Pickles (1998) and the phenomenological model\nof star counts of Bahcall & Soneira (1986). For galaxies,\nwe use spectral energy distributions (SED) from GISSEL\n(Charlot, 1993) and PEGASE (Fioc, 1997) and a luminosity function derived from a review of the most recent Rband luminosity functions of the literature. We choose the\nCFRS-type evolution in the galaxy luminosity function,\nwith luminosity evolution of only the late-type galaxies.\nFor QSOs, we use an extrapolation of the composite spectrum of Francis (1991), and the luminosity function of the\n2dF QSO survey.\nUsing the realistic mock catalogues, we perform a PCA\nand extract the first 10 eigencomponents. The 10-D space\nallows one to separate efficiently stars, galaxies, and QSOs\neven at low signal-to-noise ratios. 98% of stars, 100% of\ngalaxies and 93% of QSOs are classified correctly at a median signal-to-noise ratio S/N = 6. These values increase\nto 100% of stars, 100% of galaxies and 100% of QSOs at a\nmedian S/N = 10. For SEDs with a median S/N = 6, the\n10-component PCA also provides a measurement of redshifts accurate to \u03c3Res. <\n\u223c 0.05 for galaxies with z <\n\u223c 0.7,\n>\nand to \u03c3Res. <\n0.2\nfor\nQSOs\nwith\nz\n2.\nAt\na\nmedian\n\u223c\n\u223c\nS/N = 20, \u03c3Res. <\n\u223c 1 and for\n\u223c 0.02 for galaxies with z <\nQSOs with z >\n2.5\n(for\na\ngiven\nmedian\nS/N\n, a 10 to 30\n\u223c\ntimes lower S/N is expected at the extreme wavelengths of\nthe bluest/reddest objects). This is not sufficient for smallscale 3-D clustering analyses, but perfectly adequate for\nluminosity function studies, and for measuring the evolution with redshift in the large-scale clustering using projected moments.\nThis paper also underlines the main weakness of the\nPCA. It is well-known that age, star-formation rate, redshift, and dust extinction produce degenerate SEDs at a\nresolution R \u2243 40. Although the PCA is not able to resolve some intrinsic degeneracies due to the medium-band\nobserving technique, it efficiently reduces the noise in the\nSEDs at the expense of additional degeneracies. The solution to this problem may lie in the combination of a\nPCA with a standard \u03c72 fitting procedure. Another crucial issue in the use of the PCA for type/class/redshift\nmeasurement, is to calculate the eigenvectors from a sample in which each type of object is sufficiently well represented. The use of such a catalog, constructed from a\ncombination of a wide variety of well calibrated observed\nSEDs together with precise evolutionary models, will guarantee the best results for PCA analyses. These reference\nsamples will also allow detection of new types of object,\n\n\fCabanac, de Lapparent, Hickson: Classification and redshift estimation by PCA\n\nas these will significantly deviate from the sequences of\nknown objects.\nAcknowledgements.
