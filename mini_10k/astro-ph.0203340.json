The roles\nof supernovae of different type (I, II) is discussed in the general framework of galactic evolution and in connection with the interpretation of high redshift objects. Finally, the chemical\nenrichment of the intracluster medium as due mainly to ellipticals and S0 galaxies is discussed.\n\n1. Basic parameters of chemical evolution\nGalactic chemical evolution is the study of the evolution in time and space of the\nabundances of the chemical elements in the interstellar gas in galaxies. This process is\ninfluenced by many parameters such as the initial conditions, the star formation and\nevolution, the nucleosynthesis and possible gas flows.\nHere I describe each one separately:\n\u2022 Initial conditions- One can assume that all the initial gas out of which the galaxy\nwill form is already present when the star formation process starts or that the gas is\nslowly accumulated in time. Then one can assume that the initial chemical composition\nof this gas is primordial (no metals) or that some pre- enrichment has already taken\nplace (e.g. Population III stars). As we will see in the following, different assumptions\nare required for different galaxies.\n\u2022 The birthrate function- Stars form and die continuously in galaxies, therefore a\nrecipe for star formation is necessary. We define the stellar birthrate function as the\nnumber of stars formed in the time interval dt and in the mass range dm as:\nB(m, t) = \u03c8(t)\u03c6(m)dtdm\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c8(t) = SF R\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere:\nis the star formation rate (SFR), and:\n\u03c6(m) = IM F\n\n(1.3)\n\nis the initial mass function (IMF). The SFR is assumed to be only a function of time and\nthe IMF only a function of mass. This is clearly an oversemplification but is necessary\nin absence of a clear knowledge of the star formation process.\n\u2022 Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis- Nuclear burnings take place in the stellar\ninteriors during the star lifetime and produce new chemical elements, in particular metals.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nThese metals, together with the pristine stellar material is restored into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) at the star death. This process clearly affects crucially the chemical\nevolution of the ISM. In order to take into account the elemental production by stars we\ndefine the \"yields\", in particular the stellar yields (the amount of elements produced by\na single star) and the yields per stellar generation (the amount of elements produced by\nan entire stellar generation).\n\u2022 Supplementary Parameters- Infall of extragalactic gas, radial flows and galactic\nwinds are important ingredients in building galactic chemical evolution models.\n\n2. The stellar birthrate\n2.1. Theoretical recipes for the SFR\nSeveral parametrizations, besides the simple one of a constant \u03c8(t), are used in the\nliterature for the SFR:\n\u2022 Exponentially decreasing:\nSF R = \u03bde\u2212t/\u03c4\u2217\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith \u03c4\u2217 = 5 \u2212 15 Gyr in order to produce realistic values which can be compared with\nthe present time SFR in the Milky Way (Tosi, 1988).\n\u2022 The Schmidt (1965) law:\nk\nSF R = \u03bd\u03c3gas\n\n(2.5)\n\nis the most widely adopted formulation for the SFR. It was originally formulated by\nSchmidt (1959;1963) as a function of the volume gas density with k = 2.0. He measured\nthe space density of stars in different regions of the Galaxy in relation to the number\ndensity of neutral hydrogen, measured by means of the 21 cm emission The formulation\nas a function of the surface gas density \u03c3gas is normally preferred for studying the Milky\nWay disk and galactic disks in general. In principle, Schmidt's formulation as a function\nof the volume gas density and that with \u03c3gas are equivalent when k = 1. Kennicutt,\nin a series of papers (1983;1989;1998a,b) tried to assess the dependence of massive star\nformation on the surface gas density in disk galaxies, by comparing H\u03b1 emission with the\ndata on the distribution of HI and CO and found that the SFR can be well represented\nby a Schmidt law with k = 1.4 \u00b1 0.15. The quantity \u03bd is the efficiency of star formation\nand is expressed in units of time\u22121 .\n\u2022 A more complex formulation, which depends also upon the total surface mass density,\nwas suggested by Dopita and Ryder (1994) and can be written as:\nk1 k2\nSF R = \u03bd\u03c3tot\n\u03c3gas\n\n(2.6)\n\nwith \u03c3tot being the total surface mass density. This kind of SFR is related to the feedback\nmechanism between the energy injected into the ISM by supernovae (SNe) and stellar\nwinds and the local potential well.\n\u2022 In alternative to the Schmidt law, Kennicutt proposed also the following star formation law, which fits equally well the observational data:\nSF R = 0.017\u03a9gas \u03c3gas \u221d R\u22121 \u03c3gas\n\n(2.7)\n\nwith \u03a9gas being the angular rotation speed of the gas.\n2.2. The tracers of star formation\nThe main tracers of star formation in galaxies are:\n\u2022 Counts of luminous supergiants in nearby galaxies under the assumption that their\nnumber is proportional to the SFR.\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\n3\n\n\u2022 The H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 flux from HII regions, which are ionized by young and hot stars,\nunder the assumption that such flux is proportional to the SFR (Kennicutt 1998):\nSF R(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 7.9 * 10\u221242 LH\u03b1 (ergs\u22121 )\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u2022 From the integrated UBV colors and spectra of galaxies one can estimate the relative\nproportions of young and old stars and derive the ratio between the present time SFR\nand the average SFR in the past.\n\u2022 The frequency of type II SNe as well as the distribution of SN remnants and pulsars\ncan be used as tracers of the SFR. These tracers have been used for deriving the SFR in\nthe Galactic disk.\n\u2022 The radio emission from HII regions can also be a tracer of the SFR.\n\u2022 The ultraviolet continuum and the infrared continuum (star forming regions are\nsurrounded by dust) are also connected to the SFR as in the following expression:\nSF R(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 0.9 * 10\u22126\n\nL(U V )\nLbol\u2299\n\n(2.9)\n\nderived by means of a two-slope IMF by Donas et al. (1987).\n\u2022 Finally, the SFR can be derived from the distribution of molecular clouds (Rana\n1991).\nAll of these formulations for the SFR need the assumption of an IMF and viceversa,\nthe derivation of the IMF needs the assumption of a star formation history, as described\nin the next section. The local SFR, derived under the assumption of a particular IMF,\nsuitable for the solar neighbourhood, gives the following range of values:\nSF R = 2 \u2212 10M\u2299 pc\u22122 Gyr\u22121\n\n(2.10)\n\n(see Timmes et al. 1995)\n2.3. The IMF: Various Parametrizations\nThe IMF is a probability distribution function and is normally approximated by a power\nlaw, namely:\n\u03c6(m) = am\u2212(1+x)\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich is the number of stars with masses in the interval m, m+dm. The IMF can be\none-slope (Salpeter (1955) x=1.35) or multi-slope (Scalo 1986,1998; Kroupa et al. 1993).\nThe IMF is usually normalized as:\nZ \u221e\nm\u03c6(m)dm = 1\n(2.12)\n0\n\nThe IMF is derived locally from the present day mass function (PDMF) which in turn is\nobtained by counting the Main Sequence stars per interval of magnitude. Then the star\ncounts are transformed into number of stars per pc2 and then a mass-luminosity relation\nis adopted to pass from the luminosity to the mass.\n2.4. Derivation of the IMF\nAs already mentioned, the IMF is derived by the observed PDMF, which is the current\nmass distribution of Main-Sequence (MS) stars per unit area, n(m).\nFor stars (0.1 < m/m\u2299 \u2264 1) with lifetimes \u03c4m \u2265 tG (with tG being the Galactic age),\nn(m) can be written as:\n\n\f4\n\nFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nn(m) =\n\nZ\n\ntG\n\n\u03c6(m)\u03c8(t)dt\n\n(2.13)\n\n0\n\nwhere tG is the Galactic lifetime. These stars are all still on the MS. If \u03c6(m) is constant\nin time, as it is usually assumed, then:\nn(m) = \u03c6(m) < \u03c8 > tG\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere < \u03c8 > is the average SFR in the past.\nFor stars with \u03c4m << tG (m \u2265 2M\u2299 ), we see on the MS only those born after the time\n(t = tG \u2212 \u03c4m ). The PDMF is therefore:\nZ tG\n\u03c6(m)\u03c8(t)dt\n(2.15)\nn(m) =\ntG \u2212\u03c4m\n\nAgain, if \u03c6(m) is constant in time:\nn(m) = \u03c6(m)\u03c8(tG )\u03c4m\n\n(2.16)\n\nunder the assumption that \u03c8(tG ) = \u03c8(tG \u2212 \u03c4m ), where \u03c8(tG ) is the SFR at the present\ntime, tG , and \u03c4m is the lifetime of a star of mass m.\nThe IMF, \u03c6(m), in the mass interval 1 \u2212 2 M\u2299 depends on the ratio:\nb(tG ) =\n\n\u03c8(tG )\n<\u03c8>\n\n(2.17)\n\nIt has been shown by Scalo (1986) that a good fit between the two portions of the \u03c6(m),\nnamely below 1M\u2299 and above 2M\u2299 , requires:\n0.5 \u2264 b(tG ) \u2264 1.5\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhich means that the SFR in the local disk should have varied in time less than a factor\nof 2 during the whole disk lifetime.\n2.5. The Infall Rate: Various Parametrizations\nThe presence of infall of extragalactic gas in the chemical evolution of galaxies is demanded by the G-dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar vicinity and by the existence\nof high velocity clouds infalling towards the galactic disk. The origin of this infalling gas\non the Galaxy is not yet entirely clear and measurements of the metallicity of such gas\nare necessary to decide whether it originates in the galactic disk (galactic fountain) or if\nit has an extragalactic origin.\nSeveral parametrizations for the infall rate have been used so far:\n\u2022 Constant in space and time\n\u2022 Variable in space and time such as:\nIR = A(R)e\u2212t/\u03c4 (R)\n\n(2.19)\n\nwith \u03c4 (R) is constant or varying along the disk and A(R) is derived by fitting the present\ntime distribution of \u03c3tot (R, tG ).\n\n3. Nucleosynthesis\nDuring the Big Bang the light elements (D, 3 He, 4 He and 7 Li) were produced. On\nthe other hand, all the elements heavier than 7 Li, with the exception of Be and B, are\nproduced inside stars. The light elements 6 Li, Be and B are instead manufactured by\nspallation processes in the ISM due to the interaction between cosmic rays and interstellar\natoms.\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\n5\n\n3.1. Nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang\nI give here a brief summary of the main steps in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\nWhen the temperature in the universe was T = 1012 K, only weak interactions causing\nconversions between protons and neutrons occurred, namely:\np + e \u2194 n + \u03bd,\n\n(3.20)\n\np + \u03bd\u0303 \u2194 n + e+ .\n\n(3.21)\n\n9\n\n8\n\nThe nucleosynthesis started when T = 10 K and lasted until T = 10 K. The first\nelement to be formed was D (a nucleus composed by a neutron plus a proton) and\nsubsequently 3 He from the reaction:\nD + p \u21923 He + \u03b3\n\n(3.22)\n\nfollowed by:\n3\n\nHe + n \u21924 He + \u03b3\n7\n\n\u22129\n\n(3.23)\n7\n\n\u221211\n\nThen also very small fractions of Li (10 by mass) and Be (10\nby mass) were\nproduced.\nOne of the major achievements in cosmology is that it can account simultaneously\nfor the primordial abundances of H, D, 3 He, 4 He and 7 Li but only for a low density\nuniverse. The comparison between the observed primordial abundances and the Big\nBang nucleosynthesis calculations can allow to impose constraints upon the baryon to\nphoton ratio (\u03b7) in the universe. In particular, for a baryon to photon ratio \u03b7 \u223c 3 * 10\u221210\nthe baryonic density parameter of the universe is (Peacock, 1999):\n0.010 \u2264 \u03a9b h2 \u2264 0.015\n\n(3.24)\n\n3.2. Stellar Nucleosynthesis\nBefore discussing stellar nucleosynthesis we need to define the crucial stellar mass ranges.\n\u2022 Brown Dwarfs (M < ML , ML = 0.08 \u2212 0.09M\u2299). They never ignite H and their\nlifetimes are larger than the age of the universe.\n\u2022 Low mass stars (0.5 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 MHeF ) (MHeF =1.85-2.2M\u2299 depending on stellar\nmodels) ignite He explosively and become C-O white dwarfs (WD). If M < 0.5M\u2299 they\nbecome He WD. The lifetimes range from several 109 years up to several Hubble times.\n\u2022 Intermediate mass stars (MHeF \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 Mup ) ignite He quiescently. Mup is\nthe limiting mass for the formation of a C-O degenerate core and is in the range 5-9M\u2299,\ndepending on stellar evolution models. Their lifetimes range from several 107 to 109\nyears. These stars die as C-O WDs if they are not in binary systems. If in binary\nsystems, stars in this mass range can give rise to Type Ia SNe (see later).\n\u2022 Massive stars (M > Mup )\nStars in the mass range Mup \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 10 \u2212 12 become e-capture SNe (Type II SNe)\nand leave neutron stars as remnants. Stars in the range 10 \u2212 12 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 MW R\n(MW R \u223c 20 \u2212 40M\u2299 ) end their lives as core-collapse SNe (Type II) and leave a neutron\nstar or a black hole as a remnant. Stars in the range MW R \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 100 probably\nbecome Type Ib SNe. The lifetimes of these stars are in the range from several 107 to\n\u223c 106 years.\n\u2022 Very Massive Stars (M > 100M\u2299), if they exist, explode by means of \"pair creation\"\nand are called pair-creation SNe. In fact, at T \u223c 2 * 109 K a large portion of the\n\n\f6\n\nFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\ngravitational energy goes into creation of pairs (e+ , e\u2212 ), thus the star becomes unstable\nand explodes. These SNe leave no remnant and have lifetimes < 106 years.\n\u2022 Supermassive objects (400 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 7.5 * 105), if they exist, either explode due to\nexplosive H-burning or collapse directly to black holes. The only available nucleosynthesis\ncalculations for these stars are from Woosley et al. (1984).\nAll the elements with mass number A from 12 to 60 have been formed in stars during\nthe quiescent burnings occurring during their lifetime. The main nuclear burnings are\nH, He, C, Ne, O and Si. Stars transform H into He and then He into heaviers until\nthe Fe-peak elements, where the binding energy per nucleon reaches a maximum. At\nthis point nuclear fusion reactions cannot occur anymore and the Fe nucleus starts contracting. When the central density reaches the atomic nuclear density, matter becomes\nuncompressible and a core-bounce occurs with the consequent formation of a shock wave\nand ejection of the star mantle. However, a problem exists for the explosion of stars with\nlarge Fe cores since most of the collapse gravitational energy is used to photodisintegrate\nFe, thus weakening the shock wave and preventing the mantle ejection. To overcome\nthis problem it has been suggested the existence of some mechanisms able to rejuvenate\nthe shock wave, such as neutrino-heating from the collapsing neutron star, rotation and\nmagnetic fields.\nHere is a summary of the main nucleosynthesis stages: the first element to be burned is\nH, which is transformed into He through the proton-proton chain or the CNO-cycle, then\n4\nHe is transformed into 12 C through the triple \u03b1 reaction. Elements heavier than 12 C are\nthen produced by synthesis of \u03b1-particles thus producing the so-called \u03b1-elements (O, Ne,\nMg, Si, S, Ca and Ti). The last main burning in stars is the 28 Si -burning which produces\n56\nN i which then \u03b2-decays into 56 Co and 56 F e. Si-burning can be quiescent or explosive\n(depending on the temperature) but it always produces Fe. Explosive nucleosynthesis\noccurs in the inverse order (Si, O, Ne, C, He, H) relative to quiescent nucleosynthesis,\ndepending on the fact that it starts in the center and propagates outwards following\nthe passage of the shock wave. The main products of explosive nucleosynthesis are the\nFe-peak elements. It is worth noting that low and intermediate mass stars never ignite\nC and thus end their lives as C-O white dwarfs. Stars with masses below 10\u2013 12 M\u2299\n(depending on stellar models) explode during O-burning and end up as e-capture SNe.\nOnly massive stars can ignite all six nuclear fuels until they form an Fe-core. S- and\nr-process elements (elements with A> 60 up to Th and U) are formed by means of slow\nor rapid (relative to the \u03b2- decay) neutron capture by Fe seed nuclei. In particular, sprocessing occurs during quiescent He-burning both in massive and low and intermediate\nmass stars, whereas r-processing occurs during SN explosions.\n3.3. Supernova Progenitors\nSupernovae, planetary nebulae (PNe) and, to a minor extent, stellar winds are the means\nto restore the nuclearly enriched material into the ISM, thus giving rise to the process of\nchemical evolution. There are two main Types of SNe (II, I) then divided in subclasses:\nSNe IIL, IIP and SNe Ia, Ib, Ic. As already mentioned before, SNe II, which are believed\nto be the end state of stars more massive than 10M\u2299 exploding after a Fe core is formed\n(core-collapse SNe), produce mainly \u03b1-elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca) plus some Fe.\nThe amount of Fe produced by type II SNe is one of the most uncertain quantities since\nit depends upon the so-called mass cut (how much Fe remains in the collapsing core and\nhow much is ejected) and on explosive nucleosynthesis.\nType Ia SNe are believed to originate from the C-deflagration of a WD reaching the\nChandrasekhar mass (1.44 M\u2299 ) after accretion of material from a young companion in\na close binary system. C-deflagration occurs as a consequence of such accretion and\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\n7\n\nan explosion ensues destroying the whole star. No remnant is then left behind. They\nproduce a large amount (\u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.7M\u2299 ) of 56 N i (Fe) plus traces of C to Si elements.\nC-deflagration is the explosive burning which best reproduces the observed abundance\npattern in Type Ia SN remnants. The best model for this kind of explosion is model W7\nby Nomoto, Thielemann & Yokoi (1984). The amount of Fe produced by the other Type\nI SNe is smaller than that produced by the Type Ia ones at least a factor of two or more.\nTherefore, Type Ia SNe should be considered as the responsible for the Fe enrichment in\nthe universe.\n3.4. Element production\nHere is a summary of element production:\n\u2022 Big Bang \u2192 light elements H, D, 3 He, 4 He, 7 Li. Deuterium is only destroyed inside\nstars to form 3 He. 3 He is also mainly destroyed. The only stars producing some 3 He\nare those with masses < 2.5M\u2299 . Recent prescriptions for the yields of 3 He are from\nForestini & Charbonnel (1997) and Sackmann & Boothroyd (1999). Lithium: 7 Li is\nproduced during the Big Bang but also in stars: massive AGB stars, SNe II, carbonstars and novae. Some 7 Li should also be produced in spallation processes by galactic\ncosmic rays (see Romano et al. 2001).\n\u2022 Spallation Processes \u2192 6 Li, Be and B.\n\u2022 Type II SNe \u2192 \u03b1-elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca), some Fe, s-process elements (A <\n90) and r-process elements. Yields are from Woosley & Weaver (1995) and Thielemann\net al. (1996).\n\u2022 Type Ia SNe \u2192 Fe-peak elements. Yields are from Nomoto et al. (1984) and Nomoto\net al. (1997).\n\u2022 Low and intermediate mass stars \u2192 4 He, C, N, s-process (A > 90) elements. Yields\nare from Renzini & Voli (1981), Marigo et al. (1996), van den Hoek & Groenewegen\n(1997) and Gallino et al. (1998).\n3.5. Stellar yields\nIn order to include the results from nucleosynthesis into chemical evolution models we\nneed to define the stellar yields. The stellar yield of an element i is defined as the mass\nfraction of a star of mass m which has been newly created as species i and ejected:\nMej\n)i\n(3.25)\nm\nIn order to compute pim we need to know some fundamental quantities from stellar\nevolution and nucleosynthesis:\n\u2022 M\u03b1 is the mass of the He-core (where H is turned into He)\n\u2022 MCO is the mass of the C-O core (where the He is turned into heaviers)\n\u2022 Mrem is the mass of the remnant (WD, neutron star, black hole)\nThese masses are related to each other by the following relations:\npim = (\n\nM\u03b1 \u2212 MHe = MCO\nwhere MHe is the newly formed and ejected 4 He and:\nMCO \u2212 Mr = MC + MO + Mheaviers\nThe values of these different quantities are given by stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis\ncalculations.\n\n\f8\n\nFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\n4. Modelling chemical evolution\n4.1. Analytical models\nThe simplest model of chemical evolution is the Simple Model for the chemical evolution\nof the solar neighbourhood. The basic assumptions of the Simple Model are:\n- the system is one-zone and closed, namely there are no inflows or outflows,\n- the initial gas is primordial (no metals),\n- \u03c6(m) is constant in time,\n- the gas is well mixed at any time.\nIn the following we will adopt the formalism of Tinsley (1980) and define:\n\u03bc=\n\nMgas\nMtot\n\n(4.26)\n\nas the fractional mass of gas, with:\nMtot = M\u2217 + Mgas\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhere M\u2217 is the mass in stars (dead and alive). Possible non-baryonic dark matter is\nnot considered.\nThe mass of stars can be expressed as:\nM\u2217 = (1 \u2212 \u03bc)Mtot .\nThe abundance by mass of an element i is defined by:\nMi\nXi =\nMgas\n\n(4.28)\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhere Mi is the mass in the form of the\nPspecific element i. It is well known that the\nabundances must satisfy the condition, i Xi (t) = 1, where the summation is over all\nthe chemical elements.\nThe initial conditions are:\nMgas (0) = Mtot ; Xi (0) = 0,\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere i refers to metals. The equation for the evolution of the gas in the system can be\nwritten as:\ndMgas\n= \u2212\u03c8(t) + E(t)\n(4.31)\ndt\nwhere E(t) is the rate at which dying stars restore both the enriched and unenriched\nmaterial into the ISM. E(t) can be written as:\nZ \u221e\n(m \u2212 Mrem )\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n(4.32)\nE(t) =\nm(t)\n\nwhere m \u2212 Mrem is the total mass ejected from a star of mass m, and \u03c4m is the lifetime\nof a star of mass m. When E(t) is substituted into the gas equation one obtains an\ninteger-differential equation which can be solved analytically only by assuming Instantaneous Recycling Approximation (I.R.A.). In this approximation one assumes that all\nstars less massive than 1M\u2299 live forever whereas all stars more massive than 1M\u2299 die\ninstantaneously. In other words, I.R.A. allows us to neglect the stellar lifetimes and solve\nanalytically equation (4.31). Under I.R.A., we can define the returned fraction:\nZ \u221e\n(m \u2212 Mrem )\u03c6(m)dm\n(4.33)\nR=\n1\n\nwhich is called fraction because is divided by\n\nR\u221e\n1\n\nm\u03c6(m)dm = 1, which depends on the\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\nnormalization of the IMF. We also define the yield per stellar generation as:\nZ \u221e\n1\nyi =\nmpim \u03c6(m)dm\n1\u2212R 1\n\n9\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhere pim is the stellar yield previously defined. Then, by substituting R and yi into\nequation (4.32) we obtain:\nE(t) = \u03c8(t)R\n\n(4.35)\n\nand:\ndMgas\n= \u2212\u03c8(t)(1 \u2212 R)\n(4.36)\ndt\nThe equation for the evolution of the chemical abundances can be written as:\nd(Xi Mgas )\n= \u2212Xi \u03c8(t) + Ei (t)\ndt\nwhere:\nEi (t) =\n\nZ\n\n(4.37)\n\n\u221e\n\n[(m \u2212 Mrem )Xi (t \u2212 \u03c4m ) + mpim ] * \u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n\n(4.38)\n\nm(t)\n\ncontains both the unprocessed and the newly produced element i. It is worth noting\nthat this equation is valid for metals and not for elements which are wholly or partly\ndestroyed in stars. Under the assumption of I.R.A. the above eq. becomes:\nEi (t) = \u03c8(t)RXi (t) + yi (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\n(4.39)\n\nWhen substituted in (4.37) the equation can be solved analytically with the previous\ninitial conditions and the solution is:\n1\n(4.40)\nXi = yi ln( )\n\u03bc\nthe famous solution for the Simple Model. The yield which appears in the above solution\nis known as effective yield, simply defined as the yield yief f that would be deduced if the\nsystem were assumed to be described by the Simple Model:\nXi\n(4.41)\nln(1/\u03bc)\nThe meaning of the effective yield can be understood with the following example: if\nyief f > yi (true yield) then the actual system has attained a higher abundance for the\nelement i at a given gas fraction \u03bc.\nyief f =\n\n4.2. Failure of the Simple Model\nThe Simple Model predicts too many stars with metallicity lower than [Fe/H]= -1.0\ndex relative to observations. This is known as \"G-DWARF PROBLEM\". However, the\nG-dwarf is no more a problem since several solutions have been suggested.\nPossible solutions to the G-dwarf problem include:\n-Slow formation of the solar vicinity by gas infall\n-Variable IMF\n-Pre-enriched gas\nGenerally, the slow infalling gas is preferred since it is the most realistic suggestion\nand produces results in very good agreement with the observations, as we will see in the\nfollowing.\n\n\f10 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n4.3. Analytical models with gas flows\nThe equation for the evolution of abundances in presence of gas flows transforms into:\nd(Xi Mgas )\n(4.42)\n= \u2212Xi (t)\u03c8(t) + Ei (t) + XAi A(t) \u2212 Xi (t)W (t)\ndt\nwhere A(t) is the accretion rate of matter with abundance of the element i XAi and W (t)\nis the rate of loss of material from the system. The case A(t) = W (t) = 0 obviously corresponds to the Simple Model. The case A(t) = 0, W (t) 6= 0 corresponds to the outflow\nmodel. The easiest way of defining W (t) in order to solve the equation analytically is to\nassume:\nW (t) = \u03bb(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n(4.43)\nwhere \u03bb \u2265 0 is the wind parameter. The analytical solution for the equation of metals,\nwhich can be integrated between 0 e Xi (t) and between Mgas (0) = Mtot and Mgas (t), is:\nyi\nXi =\nln[(1 + \u03bb)\u03bc\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb]\n(4.44)\n(1 + \u03bb)\nFor \u03bb = 0 we recover the solution of the Simple Model.\nThe case of A(t) 6= 0 and W (t) = 0 corresponds to the accretion model. The easiest\nway to choose the accretion rate is:\nA(t) = \u039b(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\n(4.45)\n\nwith \u039b being a positive constant different from zero. The solution of the equation of\nmetals for a primordial infalling material (XAi = 0) and \u039b 6= 1 is :\nyi\n(4.46)\nXi = [1 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 1)\u03bc\u22121 )\u2212\u039b/(1\u2212\u039b) ]\n\u039b\nas shown by Matteucci and Chiosi (1983). If \u039b = 1 ( extreme infall model) the solution\nis:\n\u22121\nXi = yi [1 \u2212 e\u2212(\u03bc \u22121) ]\n(4.47)\nwhere the quantity \u03bc\u22121 \u2212 1 represents the ratio between the accreted mass and the initial\nmass.\n\n5. Equations with Type Ia and II SNe\nIn general, if one wants to compute in detail the evolution of the abundances of elements\nproduced and restored into the ISM on long timescales, the I.R.A. approximation is a bad\napproximation. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the stellar lifetimes in the chemical\nevolution equations and solve them with numerical methods.\nIf Gi is the mass fraction of gas in the form of an element i, we can write:\n\u0120i (t) = \u2212\u03c8(t)Xi (t)\nZ MBm\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n+\nML\nZ MBM\n\n+A\n*[\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(m)\n\nMBm\n0.5\n\nf (\u03bc)\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m2 )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m2 )d\u03bc]dm\n\n\u03bcmin\nZ MBM\n\n+B\n\nMBm\n\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 11\nZ MU\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n+\nMBM\n\n+XAi A(t) \u2212 Xi W (t)\n\n(5.48)\n\nwhere B=1-A.The parameter A represents the unknown fraction of binary stars giving rise\nto type Ia SNe and is fixed by reproducing the observed present time SN Ia rate.Generally,\nvalues in the range A = 0.05 \u2212 0.09 (according to the IMF) reproduce well the observed\nSN Ia rate in the Galaxy. The chemical abundances are defined as: Xi = GGi , where\nM\n\u03c3\nG = \u03bc = Mgas\n= \u03c3gas\n. The total mass Mtot (or surface mass density \u03c3tot ) refers to the\ntot\ntot\nmass of stars (dead and alive) plus gas at the present time.\nWi (t) = Xi W (t) is the galactic wind rate for the element i, whereas Ai (t) = A(t)XAi ,\nwith A(t) being the accretion rate for the element i.\nMBm is the total minimum and MBM the total maximum mass allowed for binary\nsystems giving rise to Type Ia SNe (Matteucci & Greggio 1986). For the model of a C-O\nWD plus a red-giant companion for the progenitors of Type Ia SNe, MBM \u2264 16M\u2299 . MBm\nis more uncertain and often has been taken to be 3M\u2299 to ensure that the primary star\n(the initially more massive in the binary system) would be massive enough to guarantee\nthat after accretion from the companion the C-O white dwarf eventually reaches the\nChandrasekhar mass and ignites carbon. This formulation of the SN Ia rate was originally\nproposed by Greggio and Renzini (1983). Greggio (1996) presented revised criteria for\nthe choice of MBm . In particular, the suggested condition for the explosion of the system\nis:\nMW D + \u01ebM2,e \u2265 MCh\n(5.49)\n(where M2,e is the envelope mass of the evolving secondary, MW D is the mass of the\nwhite dwarf and MCh is the Chandrasekhar mass).\nFor models involving Sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf masses, which have been suggested to explain subluminous Type Ia SNe Greggio obtains: MW D \u2265 0.6M\u2299 and\n\u01ebM2,e \u2265 0.15\nThe masses ML = 0.8 and MU = 100M\u2299 define the lowest and the highest mass,\nrespectively, contributing to the chemical enrichment. The function \u03c4m (m) describes the\nstellar lifetimes. The quantity Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m ) contains all the information about stellar\nnucleosynthesis for elements either produced or destroyed inside stars or both, and is\ndefined as in Talbot and Arnett (1973).\n5.1. Type Ia SN rates\nThe single degenerate (SD) scenario is based on the original suggestion of Whelan and\nIben (1973), namely C-deflagration in a WD reaching the Chandrasekhar mass after\naccreting material from a star which becomes red giant and fills its Roche lobe. An\nalternative to the SD scenario is represented by the double degenerate (DD) scenario,\nwhere the merging of two C-O WDs, due to gravitational wave radiation, creates an object\nexceeding the Chandrasekhar mass and exploding by C-deflagration (Iben and Tutukov\n1984). Negative results from observational searches for very close binary systems made\nof massive enough WDs (Bragaglia et al. 1990) has made the DD scenario less attractive\nand people to concentrate more on the SD scenario.\nA recent model has been suggested by Hachisu et al.(1996; 1999) and is based on the\nclassical scenario of Whelan and Iben (1973) but with a metallicity effect. It predicts that\nno Type Ia systems can form for [Fe/H]< \u22121.0. This model seems to have some difficulty\nin explaining the low [\u03b1/Fe] ratios observed in Damped Lyman- \u03b1 systems (DLAs) which\nshow that even at low metallicities is present the effect of Type Ia SNe. Recently,\nMatteucci & Recchi (2001) showed that there are some problems with this scenario also\n\n\f12 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\nin explaining the observed [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation in the solar neighbourhood and\nconcluded that the best model is still the SD one in the formulation proposed by Greggio\n& Renzini (1983). They also showed that the typical timescale for Type Ia SN enrichment,\ndefined as the time tSN Ia when the SN rate reaches the maximum, varies strongly from\ngalaxy to galaxy and that it is not correct to adopt a universal tSN Ia =1 Gyr, as often\nquoted in the literature. Their results indicate that for an elliptical galaxy with high\nSFR, tSN Ia = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 Gyr, for a spiral Galaxy like the Milky Way, tSN Ia = 4 \u2212 5 Gyr\nand for an irregular galaxy with a continuous but very low SFR, tSN Ia > 5 Gyr. This\nfact has very important consequences on the chemical evolution of galaxies of different\nmorphological types, as we will see in the following.\n\n6. The formation and evolution of the Milky Way\nThe first application of models of chemical evolution is the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy\nfor which we have most of the available data. Before describing the chemical evolution\nof the Galaxy I recall some of the ideas proposed for the formation of the MW. Eggen,\nLynden-Bell & Sandage (1962) suggested a rapid collapse for the formation of the Galaxy\nlasting \u223c 3 * 108 years implying that no spread in the age of Globular Clusters should\nbe observed. They based their suggestion on the finding that halo stars have high radial\nvelocities whitnessing the initial fast collapse. Later on, Searle & Zinn (1978) proposed a\ncentral collapse but also that the outer halo formed by merging of large fragments taking\nplace over a considerable timescale > 1 Gyr. More recently, Berman & Suchov (1991)\nproposed the hot Galaxy picture, an initial strong burst of star formation which inhibited\nfurther star formation for a few gigayears, while a strong galactic wind was created.\nSubsequently, the remainder of the proto-Galaxy, contracted and cooled to form the\nmajor stellar components observed today. At the present time, the most popular idea\non the formation of the Galaxy is that the inner halo formed rather quickly on a time\nscale of 0.5-1 Gyr, whereas the outer halo formed more slowly by mergers of fragments\nor accretion from satellites of the MW (see Matteucci 2001).\n6.1. Models for the Milky Way\n\u2022 SERIAL FORMATION APPROACH: halo, thick and thin disk formed in sequence,\nas a continuous process (e.g. Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois 1989).\n\u2022 PARALLEL FORMATION APPROACH: the various Galactic components start\nforming at the same time and from the same gas but evolve at different rates (e.g. Pardi,\nFerrini & Matteucci 1995). At variance with the previous scenario it predicts overlapping\nof stars belonging to the different components.\n\u2022 TWO-INFALL APPROACH: the evolution of the halo and disk are totally independent and they form out of two separate infall episodes (overlapping in metallicity is also\npredicted) (e.g. Chiappini, Matteucci & Gratton, 1997; Chang et al. 1999, Alib\u00e8s et al.\n2001).\n\u2022 STOCHASTIC APPROACH: in the early halo phases, mixing was not efficient, thus\npollution from single SNe (Tsujimoto et al. 1999; Argast et al. 2000; Oey 2000) can be\nseen in very metal poor stars. This approach predicts a large spread in the abundance\nratios at very low [Fe/H], even larger than observed.\n6.2. The two-infall model\nHere I describe in more detail the two-infall approach (Chiappini et al. 1997) since it\ngives the best agreement with observations for the halo and disk.\nThe basic equations for the evolution of the MW in this case contain only an accretion\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 13\nterm (no outflow):\ndGi (r, t)\n= \u2212Xi \u03c8(r, t)+\ndt\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u03b1n\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nMBm\n\n\u03c8(r, t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm+\nML\n\nMBm\n\n\u03c8(r, t \u2212 \u03c4m \u2212 \u2206t)Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm+\n\nML\n\nA\n\nZ\n\nMB m\n\nSN Ia+\n\nMBM\n\n(1 \u2212 A)\n\nZ\n\nMB m\n\nSN eII +\n\nZ\n\nMU\n\nSN eII+\n\nMBM\n\nMBM\n\ndGi\n)inf\ndt\nThese equations are the same as (5.48) plus a term which contains the contribution\nfrom novae, which are perhaps important producers of 7 Li, 15 N and 13 C (D'Antona\n& Matteucci, 1991;Romano et al. 2001). The nova contribution contains the parameter\n\u03b1=0.0155 which represents the fraction of WDs which are in binary systems giving rise to\nnova events. The value of \u03b1 is chosen to reproduce the present time nova rate Rnovae \u223c\n26yr\u22121 , after assuming that each nova has \u223c 104 outbursts all over its lifetime. The\nquantity \u2206t \u223c 1 Gyr is the assumed time-delay for the starting of nova activity since the\nformation of the binary system.\nThe infall rate term is defined as:\n(\n\ndGi (r, t)\nA(r)(XA )i e\u2212t/\u03c4H\nB(r)(XA )i e\u2212(t\u2212tmax )/\u03c4D (r)\n=\n+\n(6.50)\ndt\n\u03c3tot (r, tG )\n\u03c3tot (r, tG )\nwhere \u03c4H is the timescale for the inner halo formation (0.5-1 Gyr) and \u03c4D (r) is the\nthin disk timescale varying with galactocentric distance (inside-out formation):\nAi (t) =\n\n\u03c4D (r) = 0.875r \u2212 0.75\n\n(6.51)\n\n\u03c8(t) = \u03bd\u03c3tot (r, t)k1 \u03c3gas (t)k2\n\n(6.52)\n\nThe SFR is given by:\nwith k1 = 0.5 and k2 = 1.5. The behaviour of this SFR for the halo-thick disk and the\nthin-disk phase, respectively, is show in Figure 1. A threshold density (\u03c3th = 7M\u2299 pc\u22122 )\nin the SFR is assumed.\n6.3. Applications to the Local Disk\n\u2022 The G-dwarf metallicity distribution is shown in Figure 2 where the data are compared with the predictions of the two infall model assuming a time scale for the formation\nof the local disk of 8 Gyr.

In fact, for the \u03b1-elements the slowly declining [\u03b1/Fe] ratio at low [ Fe/H]\n(halo phase) is normally interpreted as due to the pollution from massive stars, whereas\n\n\f14 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nFigure 1. Predicted star formation rate in the halo-thick disk phase and in the thin disk phase\nduring the evolution of the Milky Way. Notice that because of the existence of a threshold in\nthe gas density the SFR halts in between the two major episodes of infall and oscillates in the\nlast phases of the evolution of the disk. The models are from Chiappini et al. (2001).\n\nthe abrupt change in slope occurring at \u223c [F e/H] = \u22121.0 dex is due to the Type Ia SNe\nrestoring the bulk of iron. From the [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram one can infer the timescale\nfor the formation of the halo (\u03c4h \u223c 1.5-2.0 Gyr, Matteucci and Fran\u00e7ois, 1989; Chiappini\net al. 1997), just by means of the age-[Fe/H] relationship, which indicates the time at\nwhich the metallicity of the turning point is reached. In Figure 3 we do not show the\nusual plot but [Fe/O] vs. [O/H] since in this plot are evident some features which do not\nappear in the classical diagram. In particular, the data show evidence for a gap around\n[O/H]= -0.3 dex, corresponding to [Fe/H] \u223c -1.0 dex (Gratton et al. 2000). This gap is\nwell reproduced by the model which predicts a hiatus (no more than 1 Gyr) in the SFR\nbetween the end of the thick-disk phase and the beginning of the formation of the thin\ndisk. This hiatus produces, in fact, a situation where O is no longer produced whereas Fe\nis produced, and this is revealed by the increase of [Fe/\u03b1] at constant [\u03b1/H]. This effect\nhas been observed also for [Fe/Mg] vs. [Mg/H] by Furhmann (1998). The model shown\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 15\n\nFigure 2.

(2001). The model assumes that the timescale for the disk\nformation in the solar neighbourhood is 8 Gyr.\n\nin Figure 3 is a two-infall model with a threshold density for the star formation and is\njust the existence of such a threshold which produces the hiatus in the SFR, evident in\nFigure 1.\n6.4. Applications to the whole disk\n\u2022 Abundance Gradients are known to exist along the Galactic disk from data from\nvarious sources (HII regions, PNe, B stars). These data suggest that the gradient for\noxygen is \u223c \u22120.07 dex/kpc in the galoctocentric distance range 4-14 kpc. It is not yet\nclear if the slope is unique or if there is a change in slope as a function of the galactocentric\ndistance. Similar gradients are found for N and Fe (see Matteucci 2001 and references\ntherein).\n\u2022 Gas Distribution.

No models can explain the two distributions.\nThe total gas increases towards the center with a peak at 4-6 kpc.\n\u2022 The SFR Distribution is obtained from various tracers (Lyman-\u03b1 continuum, pulsars, SN remnants, molecular clouds) and shows that the SFR increases with decreasing\ngalactocentric distance reaching a peak at 4-6 kpc in correspondence of the gas peak.\nIn order to fit gradients, SFR and gas one has to assume that the disk formed insideout, in agreement with a previous suggestion by Larson (1976) and that the SFR should\nbe a strongly varying function of the galactocentric distance. In Figure 4 is shown a\ncomparison between an inside-out model and the abundance gradient, the gas, star and\nSFR distributions.\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 17\n\n9.5\n4\n9\n\n2\n\n8.5\n\n8\n0\n7.5\n100\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFigure 4.

The Role of Radial Flows in the evolution of the Galactic Disk\nThe gas infalling onto the disk can induce radial inflows by transferring angular momentum to the gas in the disk. Angular momentum transfer can be due to the gas viscosity\nin the disk and induce inflows in the inner parts of the disk and outflows in the outer\nparts. All viscous models suggest that metallicity gradients can be steepened by radial\n(in)flows, especially if an outer star formation cut-off is assumed (Clarke 1989; Yoshii &\nSommer-Larsen 1989). All models agree that the velocity of radial (in)flows should be\nlow (v < 2 km/sec). Observationally is not clear if these radial flows exist. Edmunds &\nGreenhow (1995), by means of analytical models of galactic chemical evolution concluded\nthat there is no simple one-way effect of radial flows on abundance gradients. Portinari\n& Chiosi (2000) suggested that radial inflows may represent a possible explanation of\nthe peak of the gas at 4-6 kpc. In our opinion radial flows, if they exist, are never the\nmain cause for the formation of abundance gradients.\n\n\f18 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n6.6. The Role of the IMF in the evolution of the Galactic Disk\nAbundance gradients, in principle can be obtained by a variation of the IMF along the\ndisk. One can assume either that more massive stars form in external regions or the\ncontrary, that more low mass stars form in external regions. It has been shown convincingly that neither of the two options work (Carigi 1996; Chiappini et al. 2000), and that\nthere is no evidence in favor of such variations along the Galactic disk. Therefore, we can\nexclude the variation of the IMF as the main cause of abundance gradients and conclude\nthat the best agreement with the observed properties of the Galactic disk is obtained by\nassuming a constant IMF.\n6.7. Scenarios for Bulge Formation\nVarious scenarios have been proposed insofar for the formation of the Galactic bulge but\nonly one seems to reproduce the observed abundance pattern. Here I recall the main\nscenarios:\n\u2022 Accretion of extant stellar systems which eventually settle in the center of the\nGalaxy.\n\u2022 Accumulation of gas at the center of the Galaxy and subsequent evolution with\neither fast or slow star formation.\n\u2022 Accumulation either rapid or slow of metal enriched gas from the halo or thick disk\nin the Galaxy center.\n\u2022 Formation occurs out of inflow of metal enriched gas from the thin-disk.\nThe metallicity distribution of stars in the bulge as well as the [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations\nhelp in selecting the most probable scenario and suggest that a fast accumulation of gas\nin the Galactic center accompanied by fast star formation is the best scenario. In this\nframework, the bulge must have formed contemporarily to the inner halo on a similar\ntimescale. In Figures 5 and 6 we show some model predictions compared with the\nmetallicity distribution of bulge stars and the predicted [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios for the\nbulge together with the predictions for the solar neighbourhood. The model for the\nbulge presented in the two figures (Matteucci, Romano & Molaro, 1999) assumes a much\nstronger star formation rate than in the solar neighbourhood (by a factor of 10) with\nthe same nucleosynthesis prescriptions and a timescale for bulge formation of 0.5 Gyr\nas opposed to 8 Gyr in the solar vicinity. In Figure 5 it is evident that the best model\nto reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution requires a Salpeter (1955) IMF which is\nsligthly flatter than that used for the solar neighbourhood (Scalo, 1986). The predicted\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratios in Figure 6 indicate that the bulge stars should show overabundances of\n\u03b1-elements for most of the [Fe/H] range, as it seems also suggested by observations (Mc\nWilliam & Rich, 1994; Barbuy, 1999). This is a consequence of the time-delay between\nType Ia and II SNe, coupled with a very fast evolution in the bulge as compared to the\nsolar vicinity. In fact, in this case high values of [Fe/H] are reached in the gas before\na substantial number of SNe Ia has the time to restore the bulk of iron. The contrary\noccurs in a system with lower star formation than in the solar neighbourhood, such as\nthe external regions of the disk and irregular galaxies. In these systems we expect that\nthe overabundance of \u03b1-elements relative to Fe is maintained only for a short interval of\n[Fe/H] (see Pagel, 1997: Matteucci 2001).\n\n7. Disks of Other Spirals\nAbundance gradients\nAbundance gradients in dex/kpc are known to exist also in the disk of other spirals\nshowing that they are steeper in smaller disks, but this correlation disappears if the\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 19\n\nFigure 5. Comparison between data (dotted lines) and model predictions for the metallicity\ndistribution of bulge stars. The data are from McWilliam & Rich (1994) and the models (continuous lines) from Matteucci et al. (1999). Each panel corresponds to a model with a different\nIMF slope, as indicated.\n\ngradients are expressed in units of dex/scalelength, thus indicating the existence of a\nuniversal slope per unit scalelength (e.g. Garnett, 1998). Another remarkable characteristic about abundance gradients in other spirals is that they appear to be flatter in\ngalaxies with central bars, suggesting that the dynamical effect of the bar can influence\nthe evolution of the disk.\nThe SFR\nThe SFR is measured mainly from H\u03b1 emission (Kennicutt, 1998) and implies a correlation with the total surface gas density (HI+H2 ) as discussed in section 2.1.\nGas distributions\nGas distributions, especially the HI distribution is known for a fair sample of spirals.\nThere are indications of differences between field and cluster spirals (e.g. Skillman et al.\n1996).\nIntegrated colors\n\n\f20 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nFigure 6. Predicted [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations for the bulge (continuous lines) and for the\nsolar neighbourhood (dotted lines). The models are from Matteucci et al. (1999).\n\nStudies of integrated colors of spiral disks reflect the observed abundance gradients\nand are well reproduced by an inside-out formation of disks similar to what assumed for\nthe Milky Way (Josey & Arimoto 1992; Jimenez et al. 1998; Prantzos & Boissier 2000).\n\n8. Conclusions on the Milky Way and other spirals\nThe comparison between observations and models for the Milky Way suggests that:\n\u2022 The disk of the Galaxy formed mostly by infall of primordial or very metal poor\ngas accumulating faster in the inner than in the outer regions (inside-out scenario, i.e.\n\u03c4D (R) decreases with decreasing R).\n\u2022 In the framework of the inside-out scenario, the SFR should be a strongly varying\nfunction of the galactocentric distance. In particular, it should either depend on the total\nsurface mass density (feed-back mechanism) or on the angular circular velocity of gas.\nBoth formulations for the SFR are supported by observations. Under the assumption of\na strongly varying SFR, the observed abundance gradients can be nicely reproduced.\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 21\n\u2022 Radial flows probably are not the main cause of gradients but can help in reproducing\nthe gas profile.\n\u2022 A constant IMF (in time and space) should be preferred, since variable IMFs have\nbeen tested and they cannot reproduce all of the observational constraints of the solar\nneighbourhood and the whole disk at the same time.\n\u2022 The properties of the disks of other spirals also indicate an inside-out disk formation.\n\u2022 In the framework of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation (Mo, Mao & White,\n1998), the evolution of galaxy disks can be described by means of scaling laws calibrated\non the Galaxy with Vc and \u03bb as parameters (Jimenez et al. 1998; Prantzos & Boissier,\n2000), where Vc is a measure of the mass of the dark halo and \u03bb is a measure of the\nspecific angular momentum of the halo.\n\u2022 Dynamical processes such as the formation of a central bar can influence the evolution of disks and deserve more attention in the future.\n\u2022 Abundance ratios (e.g. [\u03b1/Fe]) in stars al large galactocentric distances can give\nus a clue to interpret the formation of the disk and the halo (inside-out or outside-in).\nIn fact, in a typical inside-out scenario we predict that the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios would decrease\nwith galactocentric distance, due to the weaker and sometimes intermittent SF regime,\nwhereas in an outside-in scenario we would expect the contrary due to the faster evolution\nof the more external region which quickly consume the gas before Type Ia SNe have time\nto restore the bulk of Fe.\n\u2022 The predictions of chemical evolution models can be tested in a cosmological context\nto study the galaxy surface brightness and size evolution as a function of redshift. Roche\net al. (1998) have already done that and suggested that a size and luminosity evolution,\nas suggested by the inside-out scenario fits better the observations.\n\u2022 Inside-out formation of the Galaxy is suggested also by the fact that the globular\nclusters of the inner halo are coeval (\u2206t \u223c 0.5 Gyr, Rosenberg et al. 1999), whereas the\nage difference seems to increase in the outer halo.\n\u2022 The metallicity distribution of stars in the Bulge as well as the observed [\u03b1/Fe] ratios\nsuggest a very fast formation of the Bulge (\u223c 0.5-0.8 Gyr), due a the very fast SFR, as\npredicted by succesfull chemical evolution models and by Elmegreen (1999).\n\n9. Elliptical Galaxies\nElliptical galaxies are mainly found in galaxy clusters, they show a large range of\nluminosities and masses and are made by stars as old as those in globular clusters. No\ncold gas is observed in these galaxies but hot X-ray gas halos are present. Because of\ntheir large masses and metal content they are probably the most important factories of\nmetals in the universe.\n9.1. Observational properties\nHere I recall the main observational features of elliptical galaxies:\n\u2022 The existence of Color-Magnitude and color - velocity dispersion (\u03c3o ) relations (colors become redder with increasing luminosity and mass; e.g. Bower et al. 1992) is interpreted as a metallicity effect, namely as the fact that the metallicity decreases outwards\nsimilarly to what happens in spiral disks.\n\u2022 The existence of a M g2 \u2013\u03c3o (where M g2 is a metallicity index) relation reinforces the\nprevious point (Bender et al. 1993; Bernardi et al. 1998; Colless et al. 1999; Kuntschner\net al. 2001).\n\u2022 Inside ellipticals, M g2 correlates also with the escape velocity vesc , as first shown\n\n\f22 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\nby Franx & Illingworth (1990), indicating that the magnesium index is larger where the\nescape velocity is larger.\n\u2022 M/LB increases by a factor of \u223c 3 from faint to bright ellipticals implying a tilt of\nthe fundamental plane of ellipticals (Bender et al. 1992). The fundamental plane is the\nparticular plane occupied by these galaxies in the space defined by the stellar velocity\ndispersion, the effective radius and the surface brigthness.\n\u2022 Abundance gradients inside ellipticals have been measured by means of metallicity\nindices such as M g2 and < F e > (Carollo et al. 1993; Davies et al. 1993; Kobayashi &\nArimoto 1999). These gradients correspond roughly to a gradient in [Fe/H] of the stellar\ncomponent of \u2206[F e/H]/\u2206logr \u223c \u22120.3.\nThe average metallicity of the stellar component in ellipticals is < [F e/H] >\u2217 \u223c \u22120.3dex\n(from -0.8 to +0.3).\n\u2022 By comparing synthetic metallicity indices with the observed ones some authors\n(Worthey et al. 1992; Weiss et al. 1995; Kuntschner et al. 2001) have suggested that\nthe average stellar < [M g/F e] >\u2217 is larger than zero (from 0.05 to + 0.3 dex) in nuclei\nof giant ellipticals. Moreover, there is indication that < [M g/F e] >\u2217 increases with\nincreasing \u03c3o (Mgal ) and luminosity (Worthey et al. 1992; Jorgensen 1999; Kuntschner\net al. 2001).\nIn particular the relation found by Kuntschner et al. (2001) is: [Mg/Fe]=0.30(\u00b10.06)log\u03c3o\u2212\n0.52(\u00b10.15).\n9.2. Formation of Ellipticals\nSeveral mechanisms have been suggested for the formation and evolution of elliptical\ngalaxies, in particular:\n\u2022 Early monolithic collapse of a gas cloud or early merging of lumps of gas where\ndissipation plays a fundamental role (Larson 1974; Arimoto & Yoshii 1987; Matteucci &\nTornamb\u00e8 1987 ). In this scenario the star formation stops soon after a galactic wind\ndevelops and the galaxy evolves passively since then.\n\u2022 Bursts of star formation in merging subsystems made of gas (Tinsley & Larson 1979).\nIn this picture star formation stops after the last burst and gas is lost via stripping or\nwind.\n\u2022 Early merging of lumps containing gas and stars in which some dissipation is present\n(Bender et al. 1993).\n\u2022 Merging of early formed stellar systems in a wide redshift range and preferentially\nat late epochs (Kauffmann et al. 1993). A burst of star formation can occur during the\nmajor merging where \u223c 30% of the stars can be formed (Kauffmann 1996).\nThe main difference between the monolithic collapse scenario and the hierarchical\nmerging relies in the time of galaxy formation, occurring quite early in the former scenario\nand continuously in the latter scenario. As we will see, there are arguments either in\nfavour of the monolithic or the hierarchical scenario.\n9.3. Formation of Ellipticals at low z\nHere I recall some of the main arguments in favor of the formation of ellipticals at low\nredshifts:\n\u2022 Relative large values of the H\u03b2 index measured in a sample of nearby ellipticals\nwhich could indicate prolonged star formation activity up to 2 Gyr ago (Gonzalez 1993;\nTrager et al. 1998).\n\u2022 The tight relations in the fundamental plane are due to a conspiracy of age and\nmetallicity in the sense that it should exist an age-metallicity anticorrelation implying\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 23\nthat the more metal rich galaxies are also younger (Ferreras et al. 1999; Trager et al.\n2000).\n\u2022 The apparent paucity of high luminosity ellipticals at z \u223c 1 compared to now claimed\nby a series of authors (Kauffmann et al. 1993; Zepf, 1997; Menanteau et al. 1999).\n9.4. Formation of Ellipticals at high z\nHere I recall the arguments in favor of a formation of ellipticals at high redshift:\n\u2022 The tightness of the color-central velocity dispersion relation found for Virgo and\nComa galaxies (Bower et al. 1992). If the formation of ellipticals were a continuous\nprocess we should expect a much larger spread in the galaxy colors for a given central\nvelocity dispersion. In particular, the argument goes like that: from the observed color\nscatter one can derive tH \u2212 tF \u223c 2Gyr (where tH is the Hubble time and tF the time of\ngalaxy formation). If tH = 15 Gyr then the youngest ellipticals must have formed \u223c 13\nGyr ago at z \u2265 2 (Renzini, 1994).\n\u2022 The thinness of the fundamental plane for ellipticals in the same two clusters, in\nparticular the M/L vs. M relation (Renzini & Ciotti 1993).\n\u2022 The tightness of the color-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters up to z \u223c 1\n(Kodama et al. 1998; Stanford et al. 1998)\n\u2022 The modest passive evolution measured for cluster ellipticals at intermediate redshift\n(van Dokkum & Franx 1996; Bender et al. 1996).\n\u2022 Lyman-break galaxies at z \u2265 3 where the SFR\u223c 50 \u2212 100M\u2299yr\u22121 could be the\nyoung ellipticals (Steidel et al. 1996; 1998).\n\u2022 The strongly evolving population of Luminous Infrared Galaxies suggesting that\nthey are progenitors of massive spheroidals (Blain et al. 1999; Elbaz et al. 1999).\n9.5. Models for ellipticals based on galactic winds\nMonolithic models assume that ellipticals suffer a strong star formation and quickly\nproduce galactic winds when the energy from SNe injected into the ISM equates the\npotential energy of the gas. Then, star formation is assumed to halt after the development\nof a galactic wind. In this framework, the evolution of ellipticals crucially depends on\nthe time at which a galactic wind occurs, tGW . For this reason, it is extremely important\nto understand the SN feedback and star formation process. The condition for the onset\nof a wind can be written as:\n(Eth )ISM \u2265 EBgas\n\n(9.53)\n\nThe thermal energy of gas due to SNe and stellar wind heating is:\n(Eth )ISM = EthSN + Ethw\nwith\n\nZ\n\nEthSN =\n\nt\n\n(9.54)\n\n\u01ebSN RSN (t' )dt'\n\n(9.55)\n\n\u03c6(m)\u03c8(t' )\u01ebw dmdt'\n\n(9.56)\n\n0\n\nand\nEthw =\n\nZ tZ\n0\n\n100\n\n12\n\nfor the contribution from SNe and stellar winds, respectively. The quantity RSN represents the SN rate (II and Ia). The quantities \u01ebSN = \u03b7SN \u01ebo with \u01ebo = 1051 erg where \u01ebo\nis the typical SN blast wave energy , and \u01ebw = \u03b7w Ew with Ew = 1049 erg (typical energy\ninjected by a 20M\u2299 star taken as representative), are the efficiencies for the energy transfer from SNe II and Ia into the ISM. These efficiencies, \u03b7w and \u03b7SN , can be assumed as\nfree parameters or be calculated from the results of the evolution of a SN remnant in the\n\n\f24 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\nISM and the evolution of stellar winds. The SN feedback is, in fact, a crucial parameter.\nThe formulation of Cox (1972) for the efficiency of energy injection from SNe derives\nfrom following the evolution of the shock wave produced by the explosion into an ISM\nwith constant density:\n\u01ebSN = 0.72\u01ebo erg\n\n(9.57)\n\n4/17 \u22129/17\n5.7104\u01ebo no\n\nfor tSN \u2264 tc =\nyears, where tc is the cooling time, and tSN is the time\nelapsed from the SN explosion, and:\n\u01ebSN = 2.2\u01ebo (tSN /tc )\u22120.62 erg\n\n(9.58)\n\nfor tSN > tc .\nWith these prescriptions only few % of \u01ebo are deposited into the ISM (see Bradamante\net al. 1998). However, multiple SN explosion should change the situation. Unfortunately,\nvery few calculations of this type are available. An important point to consider is also\nthat SNe Ia, which explode after Type II SNe, should provide more energy into the ISM\nthan Type II SNe since they explode in an already formed cavity (see Recchi, Matteucci\n& D'Ercole, 2001).\nThe total mass of the galaxy is expressed as Mtot (t) = M\u2217 (t) + Mgas (t) + Mdark (t)\nwith ML (t) = M\u2217 (t) + Mgas (t) and the binding energy of gas is:\nEBgas (t) = WL (t) + WLD (t)\n\n(9.59)\n\nand:\nMgas (t)ML (t)\nrL\nrepresents the potential well due to the luminous matter, whereas:\nWL (t) = \u22120.5G\n\n(9.60)\n\nMgas (t)Mdark\n(9.61)\nrL\nis the potential well due to the interaction between dark and luminous matter, where\n1\nS(1 + 1.37S) with S = rL /rD (Bertin et al. 1992).\nwLD \u223c 2\u03c0\nThe SFR is usually assumed to be:\nWLD (t) = \u2212GwLD\n\nSF R = \u03bdMgas\n\n(9.62)\n\nwhere \u03bd \u221d ML\u2212\u03b3 (\u03b3 =-0.11, Arimoto & Yoshii 1987), owing to the fact that the star\nformation efficiency is just the inverse of the timescale for star formation:\n\u22121\n\u03bd = \u03c4SF\n\n(9.63)\n\n\u03c4SF \u221d \u03c4coll \u221d \u03c4f f\n\n(9.64)\n\nand that:\nwith \u03c4coll and \u03c4f f being the collapse and the free-fall timescale, respectively. Since\ndynamical timescales are longer for more massive galaxies, the efficiency of star formation\nshould decrease with galactic mass. The efficiency \u03bd coupled with the increase of the\npotential well as ML increases leads to the fact that more massive galaxies form stars for\na longer period before suffering a galactic wind. This fact has been invoked for explaining\nthe observed mass-metallicity relation (Larson, 1974). However, this is at variance with\nthe observed [Mg/Fe] vs. \u03c3o relation, since in this scenario the more massive ellipticals\nshould show the lowest [Mg/Fe].\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 25\n9.6. Failure of Larson's Model\nThere are different ways of obtaining that [M g/F e] in the stellar component increases\nwhen the galactic mass ML increases. These ways are:\n\u2022 Different timescales for star formation (Worthey et al. 1992) in the sense that star\nformation should be more efficient in more massive galaxies (\u03bd \u221d ML\u03b3 ). In this case, the\nsituation could be such that a galactic wind occurs earlier in more massive systems, the\ninverse wind scenario (Matteucci 1994).\n\u2022 A variable IMF from galaxy to galaxy favoring more massive stars (Mg producers)\nin more massive galaxies (Worthey et al. 1992; Matteucci, 1994).\n\u2022 Different amounts and/or concentrations of dark matter as functions of ML In particular, less dark matter should be present in the most massive systems (Matteucci,\nPonzone & Gibson, 1998). As a consequence of this, again galactic winds occur earlier\nin more massive objects.\n\u2022 A selective loss of metals: more massive systems loose more Fe relative to \u03b1-elements\nthan less massive ones (Worthey et al. 1992).\nAs mentioned before, Matteucci (1994) proposed a model that she called inverse wind\nmodel, where the efficiency of star formation is an increasing function of galactic mass,\nthus implying a shorter period of star formation in massive ellipticals. In fact, the\nefficiency of star formation is chosen in such a way that in massive ellipticals the galactic\nwind occurs before than in less massive ones. This produces the increase of the [Mg/Fe]\nratio as a function of galactic mass. This approach bears a resemblance with the merging\nscenario of Tinsley & Larson (1979) where the efficiency of star formation was assumed\nto increase with the total mass of the system. In the inverse wind model a very massive\nelliptical of ML = 1012 M\u2299 starts developing a wind before 1 Gyr from the beginning of\nstar formation, whereas a small ellipticals form stars for a longer period. As a result,\nthe average < [M g/F e] >\u2217 is larger in massive than in small ellipticals. The same effect\ncan be obtained by varying the IMF in such a way that more massive ellipticals tend\nto form more massive stars. It is worth noting that this second hypothesis could also\nexplain the tilt of the fundamental plane in M/LB . On the other hand, the hypothesis\nof the variable dark matter does not produce relevant effects, as shown by Matteucci et\nal. (1998). The only assumption which has not been tested quantitatively is the selective\nloss of metals. The main problem with all of these alternatives is, in any case, the lack of\na good physical justification depending on the poorly known processes of star formation\nand SN feeback, and in the future some effort should be devoted to these fields.\nIt is worth noting that the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation cannot\nproduce a solution to the observed [Mg/Fe] trend in ellipticals. In fact, it rather predicts\nthe contrary, as shown by Thomas (1999) and Thomas et al. (2002). In fact, in the hierachical clustering the period of star formation in the most massive ellipticals is predicted\nto be the longest thus favoring low [Mg/Fe] ratios in massive objects, as shown in Figure\n7.\n9.7. Averaged Stellar Metallicities\nThe metallicity in elliptical galaxies always refers to the metal content of the stars, in\nparticular of the stellar population dominating in the visual light. For this reason we\nshould define the average stellar metallicity. In particular, the average metallicity of a\ncomposite stellar population averaged on the mass is:\nZ S1\n1\nXi (S)dS\n(9.65)\n< Xi > m =\nS1 0\n\n\f26 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nFigure 7. Predicted [\u03b1/Fe] vs. velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. Data are compared\nwith predictions obtained by adopting the star formation history assumed in hierarchical clustering models for galaxy formation.The models and the figure are from Thomas et al. (2002).\n\nwhere 1 refers to the specific time t1 and S1 is the total mass of stars ever born. This\nis the real average metallicity but in order to compare models and observations it is\nmore appropriate to define the metallicity averaged on the visual light. In particular, the\naverage metallicity of a composite stellar population averaged on the light is:\nP\nij nij Xi LV j\n< Xi > L = P\n(9.66)\nij nij LV j\n\nwhere nij is the number of stars in the abundance interval Xi and luminosity interval\nLV j .\nIt is worth noting that < Xi >m is larger than < Xi >L for galaxies with ML < 109 M\u2299 ,\nsince metal poor giants dominate the visual light whereas they are similar for larger\nmasses (Yoshii & Arimoto 1987).\n9.8. Multi-Zone Models\nThere are two multi-zone chemical evolution models for ellipticals available in the literature (Martinelli et al. 1998; Tantalo et al. 1998). Martinelli et al. (1998) assumed\nthat the elliptical galaxy is divided in several concentric shells of thickness \u2206Ri . The\nbinding energy of the gas in each shell is computed after assuming a dark matter halo as\ndescribed before. The model predicts that a galactic wind develops first in the external\nregions and then gradually in the more internal ones in agreement with the observed\nM g2 vs. vesc relation. As a consequence of this, the star formation lasts for a shorter\ntime in the external regions with the consequence that an abundance gradient is created\nin agreement with observations. This model also predicts that we should observe higher\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 27\n\nFigure 8.

Unfortunately,\nthe available data inside galaxies do not allow yet to observe such an effect. It is worth\n\n\f28 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\nnoting that this model can reproduce very well the observed color gradients in ellipticals,\nas shown in Figure 8.\n\n10. Conclusions on Ellipticals\nThe main conclusions that we can draw from comparing theoretical models and observations for ellipticals can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 In order to explain the observed < [M g/F e] >\u2217 > 0 in giant ellipticals the dominant\nstellar population should have formed on a time scale no longer than 3-5 *108 yr, which\ncorresponds to the time at which the SNe Ia rate reaches a maximum in these systems\nwith strong star formation.\n\u2022 Uncertainties in the stellar yields of Fe and Mg from different authors can change\nthe value of the [Mg/Fe] ratio but do not affect the conclusion above.\n\u2022 This observational finding argues against a hierarchical clustering formation scenario\nand favors the fact that ellipticals, especially those in clusters, are mostly old systems\n(see also Menanteau et al. 2001).\n\u2022 The increase of the [Mg/Fe] ratio with galactic mass suggests either that more massive ellipticals are older systems or that the IMF is not constant among ellipticals or\nboth.\n\u2022 Abundance gradients in ellipticals can be produced by biased winds and this would\nimply that [Mg/Fe] increases with increasing galactocentric distance.\n\u2022 Better calibrations for metallicity indices are necessary, especially taking into account non-solar ratios in stellar tracks, before drawing firm conclusions.\n\n11. Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies\nDwarf Irregular (DIG) and Blue Compact (BCG) galaxies are very interesting objects\nfor studying galaxy evolution since they are relatively unevolved objects (see Kunth &\n\u00d6stlin, 2000, for a recent exhaustive review). In bottom-up cosmological scenarios they\nshould be the first self- gravitating systems to form, thus they could also be important\ncontributors to the population of systems giving rise to QSO-absorption lines at high\nredshift (DLAs). In general, they are rather simple objects with low metallicity and\nlarge gas content, suggesting that they are either young or have undergone discontinuous\nstar formation activity (bursts). An important characteristic of these systems is that\nthey show a distinctive spread in their physical properties, such as chemical abundances\nversus fraction of gas. Matteucci and Chiosi (1983) were among the first in studying the\nchemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. They adopted analytical models as those described\nin section 3 and showed that closed-box models cannot account for the Z-log\u03bc distribution\neven if the number of bursts varies from galaxy to galaxy, and suggested possible solutions\nto explain the observed spread:\n\u2022 a. different IMFs\n\u2022 b. different amounts of galactic wind\n\u2022 c. different amounts of infall\nLater on, Matteucci and Tosi (1985) presented a numerical model where galactic winds\npowered by SNe were taken into account. They concluded that different wind rates from\ngalaxy to galaxy could explain the observed spread in O,N vs. log\u03bc but not the spread in\nthe N/O vs. O/H diagram, suggesting that additional processes could have contributed\nto that. For example, different amounts of primary N from galaxy to galaxy. Kumai\nand Tosa (1992) suggested that different fractions of dark matter in different objects\ncould explain the observed spread in the Z-log\u03bc diagram. Pilyugin (1993) forwarded\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 29\nthe idea that the spread in the properties of these galaxies (i.e. He/H vs. O/H and\nN/O vs. O/H) are due to self-pollution of the HII regions coupled with \"enriched\" or\n\"differential\" galactic winds. Differential winds should carry out of the galaxy certain\nelements more than others, for example the metals ejected by SN II should be favored. In\nmore recent models (Marconi et al. 1994; Bradamante et al. 1998), the novelty was the\ncontribution to the chemical enrichment of SNe of different type (II,Ia and Ib) together\nwith differential winds. In these papers the assumption was made that the products of\nSN II are lost more easily than the products of stars ending as WDs, such as C and\nN. Larsen et al. (2001) studied the chemical evolution of gas rich dwarf galaxies and\nconcluded that primary N production from massive stars is not necessary to reproduce\nthe N/O vs O/H and that the spread in this relation is likely to be due to the time-delay\neffect in the production of N relative to the production of O. In fact, in a starbursting\nregime when the starburst fades the elements produced by Type II SNe are no more\nproduced whereas the elements produced on long timescales by single stars and Type\nIa SNe are still produced. This causes the typical saw-tooth behaviour (see Figure 9).\nTherefore, the spread can be due to the fact that some objects are observed at different\nstages of the burst/interburts regime. They also concluded that ordinary winds are better\nthan enriched ones in reproducing the properties of these objects. The existence of a\nluminosity-metallicity relation (although with spread) can be an indication for galactic\nwinds acting more efficiently in low mass than in high mass high potential well objects.\n11.1. Evidences for Galactic Winds\nMeurer et al (1992), Papaderos et al. (1994), Lequeux et al. (1995) and Marlowe et al.\n(1995) all suggested the existence of galactic winds in dwarf starbursting galaxies. The\nevidence is gathered by the indication of outflowing material travelling at a speed larger\nthan the assumed mass of the objects. Papaderos et al. estimated a galactic wind flowing\nat a velocity of 1320 Km/sec for VIIZw403. The escape velocity estimated for this galaxy\nbeing 50 Km/sec. Lequeux et al.(1995) suggested a galactic wind in Haro2=MKn33\nflowing at a velocity of \u2243 200Km/sec. Martin (1996;1998) found supershells in 12\ndwarfs including IZw18 and concluded that they imply an outflow which in some cases\ncan become a wind (namely the material is lost from the galaxy).\nRecent chemo-dynamical simulations for one instantaneous starburst also suggest the\npossibiliy of galactic winds and that these winds are metal enriched (MacLow & Ferrara\n1999; Recchi et al. 2001).\n11.2. Results for BCG from chemical models\nPurely chemical models (no dynamics) have been computed by several authors by varying\nthe number of bursts, the time of occurrence of bursts, tburst , the star formation efficiency,\nthe type of galactic wind, the IMF and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions (Marconi et al.\n1994; Kunth et al.1995; Bradamante et al.1998). The main conclusions of these papers\ncan be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The number of bursts should be Nbursts \u2264 10, the star formation efficiency should\nvary from 0.1 to 0.7 Gyr\u22121 for either Salpeter or Scalo (1986) IMF but Salpeter IMF is\nfavored.\n\u2022 Enriched winds, carrying out material at a rate proportional to the star formation\nrate, seem to be preferred (but see Larsen et al. 2001). The observed scatter in the\nobservational properties can be due either to the winds or to the delay in the production\nof different elements.\n\u2022 If the burst duration is relatively short (no more than 100 Myr), SNe II dominate\n\n\f30 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nFigure 9. The log(N/O) vs. 12 +log(O/H) for a sample of BCG. The data are from Recchi\n(2002). Overimposed are three models with a single burst of star formation and different star\nformation efficiency. In particular, the dotted line corresponds to an efficiency \u03bd = 1Gyr \u22121 , the\ncontinuous line to \u03bd = 2.5Gyr \u22121 and the dashed line to \u03bd = 5Gyr \u22121 . The burst duration is 100\nMyr. As one can see, the saw-tooth behaviour typical of a bursting mode of star fotmation is\nevident.\n\nthe chemical evolution and energetics of starburst galaxies, while stellar winds seem to\nbe negligible after the onset of SNe II.\n\u2022 The [O/Fe] ratios tend to be overabundant due to the predominance of Type II SNe\nduring the bursts. Models with a large number of bursts Nburst =10 - 15 can give negative\n[O/Fe].\n11.3. Results from chemo-dynamical models\nRecent chemo-dynamical models (Recchi et al. 2001;2002) assuming an instantaneous\nstarburst but following in great detail the evolution of several chemical elements (H, He,\nC, N, O, Mg, Si and Fe) and adopting an efficiency for SN II energy transfer \u03b7SN II =0.003\nand for SN Ia \u03b7SN Ia =1.0, suggest that the starburst triggers indeed a galactic wind (see\nFigure 10). In particular, the metals leave the galaxy more easily than the unprocessed\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 31\n\nFigure 10. Chemo-dynamical simulation of an instantaneous starburst from Recchi et al.\n(2001). The development of a galactic wind is evident along the z-axis, since the assumed\nconfiguration is flattened.The age of the burst is indicated in Myr.\n\ngas and among the metals the SN Ia ejecta leave the galaxy more easily than the SN\nII ejecta. This is due to the assumed efficiencies for energy transfer for the two types\nof SNe. This assumption is in turn based on the fact that Type Ia SNe explode in an\nalready heated and rarified medium (thanks to the Type II SNe which explode first) and\ntherefore can transfer all of their energy into the ISM. As a consequence of this type of\nevolution the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\u2022 A selective loss of metals seems to occur in dwarf gas-rich galaxies.\n\u2022 As a consequence of the selective winds, the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios inside the galaxy are\npredicted to be larger than the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios outside the galaxy. In fact, the products of\nSNe Ia are lost more efficiently than those of SN II.\n\u2022 At variance with previous studies, most of the metals are already in the cold gas\nphase after 8-10 Myr owing to the fact that the superbubble does not break immediately\n(the SNe II inject only a fraction of their initial blast wave energy into the ISM) and\nthermal conduction can act efficiently.\n\n\f32 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\u2022 The model well reproduces the properties of IZw18 (the most metal poor galaxy\nknown locally) if two bursts are assumed and are separated by 300 Myr interval.\n11.4. Dwarf galaxies and DLA Systems\nFinally, before concluding this section, we would like to draw the attention upon the\nfact that there are similarities between BCG, DIG and DLAs or more in general between\nDLAs and systems with a low level of star formation.\nThe nature of DLA systems is under debate and the abundance ratios measured there\ncan be used as a diagnostic to infer their nature and age. Matteucci et al. (1997)\nsuggested that some DLA showing high N/O ratio could be BCG suffering selective\nwinds. In this respect, the similarity between DLAs and IZw18 may suggest that IZw18\nis a survivor proto-galaxy which has just started forming stars. If this is true, dwarf\nirregular galaxies should be born at any time during the age of the universe, unlike\nelliptical galaxies which appear to have formed a long time ago and in a short time\ninterval (see section 9).\nPlots of [\u03b1/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and plots of [\u03b1/Fe] vs. redshift should be used to infer the\nnature and the age of these objects, when compared with chemical evolution predictions.\nThe observed abundance ratios seem to indicate that DLAs show almost solar [\u03b1/Fe]\nratios at low [Fe/H] (Pettini et al. 1999; Centurion et al. 2000). This is an indication\nthat they are objects where the star formation proceeded slowly and that they have\nprobably started to form stars long before the redshift at which we observe them. This\ncould indicate that we are looking at the external regions of disks or at dwarf starbursting\nsystems in the interburst phases (see Figure 11). However, more data are necessary to\nassess this point. One common problem related to the measurement of the abundances\nin DLAs is that some elements are dust depleted such as Si and Fe and therefore one\nshould try to observe non-refractory elements such as N, O, S and Zn. One should also\nremember that Si and Ca do not strongly behave as \u03b1-elements since they are produced\nin a non-negligible way in SNe Ia.\n\n12. Chemical Enrichment of the ICM\nAfter having discussed the chemical evolution of galaxies it is important to conclude\nby studying how the evolution of galaxies can affect the chemical enrichment of the\nintracluster (ICM) and intergalactic medium. In the past years a great deal of work has\nbeen presented on the subject. The first work on chemical enrichment of the ICM was by\nGunn & Gott (1972), Larson & Dinerstein (1975), Vigroux (1977), Himmes & Biermann\n(1988). In the following years, Matteucci & Vettolani (1988) started a more detailed\napproach to the problem followed by David et al. (1991), Arnaud et al. (1992), Renzini\net al. (1993), and many others. The majority of these papers assumed that galactic winds\n(mainly from ellipticals) are responsible for the ICM chemical enrichment. Alternatively,\nthe abundances in the ICM could be due to ram pressure stripping (Himmes & Biermann\n1988) or to pre-galactic Population III stars (White & Rees 1978).\n12.1. Models for the ICM\nHere we will describe briefly the metodology developed by Matteucci & Vettolani (1988)\n(hereafter MV88). Starting from SN driven galactic wind models for ellipticals (see\nsection 9) they computed the ejected masses vs. final baryonic total galactic masses for\ngalaxies of different initial luminous masses (from 109 to 1012 M\u2299 ):\nMiej = Ei Mf\u03b2i ,\n\n(12.67)\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 33\n\nFigure 11. Redshift evolution of [Zn/H] for high surface brightness spirals (HSB) (bottom\npanels) and low surface brightness spirals (LSB) (upper panels) for different galactocentric\ndistances in the disk. a) The evolution in metallicity of LSB formed at z=4 fits well the DLA\nvalues measured by Pettini et al. (1999).b) If LSB disks formed late, however, then they do\nnot fit the data. c) Conversely, HSB disks that formed at z=4 become metal rich too quickly\nto explain the observations; d) only if there is a continuously forming population of HSB disks\nbetween z=4 and z=1 then they can account for the metallicities of the DLAs.\n\nwhere i refers to either a single chemical element or the total gas. Then, they integrated\nMiej over the cluster mass function obtained from the Schechter (1986) luminosity function (LF) by assuming that only E and S0 galaxies contribute to the chemical enrichment.\nThis assumption was later confirmed by data of Arnaud et al. (1992). The total masses\nejected into the ICM in the form of single species i and total gas are:\nej\nMi,clus\n(> Mf ) = Ei f n\u2217 (h2 k)\u03b2i 10\u22120.4\u03b2i (M\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n*\u0393[(\u03b1+1+\u03b2i ), (Mf\u2217 h2 /k)10\u22120.4(MB \u22125.48) ]\n(12.68)\nwhere \u03b1 is the slope of the LF, f is fraction of ellipticals plus S0, M \u2217 is the mass at the\n\"break\" of the LF and MB\u2217 is the magnitude at the break.\n\u22125.48)\n\n\f34 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\nTable 1.

MV88 Results\nMV88 considered 4 galaxy clusters: Perseus, A2199, Coma and Virgo for which f , n\u2217 ,\nM \u2217 , MF e and Mgas were known. In Table 1 we show the results they obtained for\nthe 4 clusters concerning the total masses ejected by all galaxies in the clusters in the\nform of total gas and Fe, compared with the observed ones. It is immediate to see from\nTable 1 that their model could reproduce well the total amount of Fe but they failed\nin reproducing the total gas mass. However, this is not a failure of the model but the\nindication that most of the gas in clusters has a primordial origin, namely has never been\nprocessed inside stars. The same conclusion was reached later by David et al. (1991)\nand Renzini et al. (1993) among others, but see Chiosi (2000).\nTherefore, the XF e /XF e\u2299 shown in Table 2 was calculated as (MF e )pred /(Mgas )obs .\nThe predicted Fe abundance in the ICM relative to the Sun is in agreement with the\nobservations then and now (XF e /(XF e\u2299 )obs = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 (Rothenflug & Arnaud 1985;\nWhite 2000). Low values for [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] were predicted due to the assumption\nthat all the Fe, produced by Type Ia SNe, was soon or later ejected into the ICM, as\nshown in Table 2. With Salpeter IMF, Type Ia SNe contribute \u2265 50% of the total Fe.\n12.3. [\u03b1/Fe] Ratios in the ICM\nModels including Type Ia and II SNe predict an asymmetry in the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios (> 0\ninside the ellipticals and < 0 in the ICM) due to the different roles of SNe II and Ia in\nFe production (Renzini et al. 1993.) ASCA results (Mutshotzky et al. 1996) originally\nsuggested [\u03b1/Fe]ICM > 0 (+0.2 dex). However, Ishimaru & Arimoto (1999) pointed out\nthat [\u03b1 /Fe] \u223c 0 in the ICM if the meteoritic Fe abundance is adopted instead of the\nphotospheric value adopted in the other paper. On the basis of the ASCA results on the\noverabundance of the \u03b1-elements, Matteucci & Gibson (1995) discussed how to reproduce\nthe [\u03b1/Fe]>0 ratios both in stars and ICM. They adopted the same SN feedback as MV88\nand dark matter halos were also included in the galaxy models. They concluded that\nit is possible to obtain overabundances of the \u03b1-elements in the ICM only if not all of\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 35\nthe produced Fe is lost from the galaxies (i.e. only early winds). On the other hand,\nMV88 had assumed that all the Fe is soon or later ejected into the ICM. They concluded\nthat a flat IMF (x=0.95) plus only early winds can reproduce [\u03b1/Fe]ICM > 0. A similar\nconclusion was reached by Loewenstein & Mutshotzky (1996). However, the situation is\nnot very realistic since the gas in cluster galaxies is likely to be stripped soon or later\nbecause of environmental effects, and the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios in the ICM are likely to be solar or\nundersolar. More recently, Martinelli et al. (2000) recomputed the ICM enrichment by\nadopting a more realistic model for the evolution of ellipticals (multi-zone). The model\n(already described in section 9) predicts a more extended period of galactic wind and\nmore metals and gas in the ICM than the one-zone model with only early winds. They\ncomputed the evolution of abundances vs. redshift for a constant LF and concluded\nthat there is no evolution between z=1 and z=0 and [\u03b1/Fe]ICM \u22640 at the present time.\nVery recently Pipino et al. (2002) computed the chemical enrichment of the ICM as a\nfunction of redshift by considering the evolution of the cluster luminosity function and\nconfirmed the conclusions of Martinelli et al. (2000). Very recent data from XMMNewton (Gastaldello & Molendi, 2002) seem to indicate a low [O/Fe]< 0 ratio for the\nICM, thus supporting models where Type Ia SNe are efficient and all the produced Fe is\nejected into the ICM. In Figure 12 we show the recent results of Pipino et al. (2002). In\nthe upper panel of Fig. 12 is indicated the predicted evolution as a function of redshift\nof the thermal energy per particle in the ICM due to galactic winds from E and S0\ngalaxies.In the lower panel is shown the evolution of the total mass of Fe ejected by the\ncluster galaxies into the ICM as a function of redshift. It is worth noting that 1 keV per\nparticle is the energy required to explain the observed LX \u2212 T relation in clusters (e.g.\nBorgani et al. 2001). The model in Figure 12 shows that the energy injected by SNe is\nnot enough (at maximum 0.4 keV) and that other sources of energy are required, such as\nactive galactic nuclei and QSO. Figure 12 also shows how important is the contribution\nfrom Type Ia SNe to the chemical enrichment and energetic content of the ICM. In fact,\nSNe II are important in triggering the galactic wind but after star formation stops the\nwind is sustained only by Type Ia SNe.\n12.4. [\u03b1/Fe] ratios and IMLR\nAbundance ratios and the Iron Mass to Light Ratio (IMLR) are good tests for the\nevolution of galaxies in clusters since they do not depend on the total cluster gas mass.\nThe IMLR is defined as (Renzini et al. 1993):\nIM LR = MFICM\ne /LB\n\n(12.69)\n\nand the IMLR \u221d h\u22120.5 . For H0 = 50 the IMLR=0.02 (M\u2299 /L\u2299 ) (Arnaud et al. 1992)\npractically constant among rich clusters but it drops for poor clusters and groups. On\nthe one hand, the IMLR can impose constraints on the IMF in cluster galaxies, on the\nbaryonic history of the clusters/groups and on the number of SNe exploded in galaxies.\nIn fact, the most straightforward interpretation of the constancy of the IMLR among\nrich clusters is that they did not loose Fe at variance with the groups or small clusters\nhaving a lower IMLR indicating a loss of baryons (Renzini, 1997). On the other hand,\nthe [\u03b1/Fe] ratios can impose constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis, IMF, different roles\nof SNe and SN feedback.\n\n13. Conclusions on the ICM\nThe main conclusions on the chemical enrichment of the ICM can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\f36 Francesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nredshift\n\n4\n\n3\nredshift\n\nFigure 12. The predicted evolution of the thermal content of the ICM (upper panel) as a\nfunction of redshift. The different contributions from SNe of different type is indicated. In the\nlower panel is shown the evolution of the total Fe mass as a function of redshift. The assumed\ncosmological model is \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u03bb = 0.7 and h=0.70.\n\n\u2022 Good models for the chemical enrichment of the ICM should reproduce at the same\ntime the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios inside galaxies and in the ICM. They should also reproduce the\nIMLR.\n\u2022 Crucial parameters are: SN feedback, SN nucleosynthesis, IMF and whether all the\nstellar ejecta (produced over a Hubble time) can reach the ICM or remain bound to the\nparent galaxy.\n\u2022 Type Ia SNe play a fundamental role in the chemical and energy content evolution\nof the ICM.\n\u2022 Good models for the ICM enrichment, assuming that the energy transfer from SN\nII is \u223c 3% and from SNIa is 100%, predict an energy per particle in the ICM of Ep \u223c 0.4\nkeV, not enough to break the self- similarity in clusters.\n\n\fFrancesca Matteucci: Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 37\nREFERENCES\nAlib\u00e8s, A., Labay,J. & Canal, R., 2001, A&A 370, 1103\nArgast, D., Samland, M., Gerhard, O.E. & Thielemann, F.-K., 2000, A&A 356, 873\nArimoto, N. & Yoshii, Y. 1987, A&A 173, 23\nArnaud, M., Rothenflug, R., Boulade, O.,Vigroux, L. & Vangioni-Flam, E., 1992,\nA&A, 254, 49\nBarbuy, B. 1999 Astrophys.
