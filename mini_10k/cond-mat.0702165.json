Kumar\nRaman Research Institute, Bangalore 560080, India\nAbstract\nThe recently observed1 equipartition of current in parallel at and below the NormalSuperconducting (N-S) transition can be understood in terms of a LandauGinzburg order-parameter phenomenology. This complements the explanation\nproposed earlier1 based on the flux-flow resistance providing a nonlinear negative\ncurrent feedback towards equipartition when the transition is approached from\nabove. The present treatment also unifies the usual textbook inductive subdivision\nexpected much below Tc, and the equipartition as Tc is approached from below. The\nquestion of metastability is also briefly discussed.\nKeywords: Superconductivity, current equipartition, order parameter, flux-flow\nresistance.\nFOLLOWING the recent work1, consider two, or more than two pieces of a wire of a\nsuperconducting material (e.g., Nb-Ti), of unequal lengths in general, connected in\nparallel and fed from a constant current source. Let the combination, assumed to be in\nthe normal state initially, be now cooled to and below the N-S transition temperature Tc.\nIt was experimentally observed1 that the usually expected normal ohmic subdivision of\nthe current crosses over to an unexpected superconducting equipartition at the transition\n(Tc), and remains so divided below Tc. The crossover was found to be reversible. A\nphysical explanation for this self-organization (namely, the equipartition without any fine\ntuning) was provided in terms of a nonlinear negative current feedback that drove the\ncurrent division towards equalization. This involved a nonlinear flux-flow resistance (R)\ndue to flux de-pinning by the transport current (J) giving \u2202R / \u2202J > 0. In the present work,\nwe propose a complementary treatment in which the N-S transition is approached from\nthe superconducting side (from below Tc). It is based on a Landau-Ginzburg orderparameter phenomenology in the presence of non-zero supercurrent. Our analytical\ntreatment gives the equipartition as Tc is approached starting from an arbitrary initial\ncurrent division much below Tc. It also resolves some other puzzles associated with the\nphenomenon, e.g., the inductive equilibrium subdivision of the supercurrent much below\nTc, and also the question of metastability.\nLabel the two conductors connected in parallel as A and B. Let A and B be the\nrespective lengths, unequal in general. For simplicity, the cross-sectional areas are taken\nto be equal (as in the experiment1), and assumed unity. Further, the transverse linear\ndimensions are assumed << (T) (coherence length) and (T) (the penetration length),\nwhich is certainly the case close to Tc. This ensures homogeneity of the superconducting\norder parameter over the entire conducting system. For a total supercurrent J (=JA + JB),\nthe dominant G-L free energy functional2\n1\n\n\fF = FA + FB\n| \u03c8 A |2\nm V A2 ,\n(1)\nA\n2\n2\nand similarly for FB.

The\norder parameters are then essentially independent of the currents. It is sufficient then to\nconsider current variations. From \u2202F / \u2202J A = 0 = \u2202F / \u2202J B , with J A + J B = J , we at\nonce obtain the current ratio\nself - induction of B\nJA / JB = B / A \u221d\n(3)\nself - induction of A\nas noted in textbooks.3 Thus, indeed the supercurrent divides inductively at equilibrium\nwell below the transition temperature. (Recall, that for equal cross-sections, selfinductance is proportional to the length. Here, we have ignored the mutual inductance).\nNext, we consider the case of real interest here when we approach the N-S transition from\nbelow. Then the order parameters A and B dominate variationally, giving\n\n1\n( 4)\n2\nand similarly for B. Recall now from the Landau theory of second-order phase\ntransitions that (T)= 0(1-T/Tco) as T Tco from below, with Tco the thermodynamic\ncritical temperature in the absence of currents.\n2\n\n\u03b1 (T ) + \u03b2 \u03c8 A + mV A2 = 0 ,\n\nIntroduce\n\ndimensionless\n\n2\n\n\u03c8 0 = (\u2212\u03b1 / \u03b2 ) and J 0 =\ncurrent JA,B, Eq.

With this, Eq. (5) defines\na (normalized) critical current\nj c = (2 / 3 3 ) (1 \u2212 t ) 3 / 2\n( 6)\n2\n\n2 1/ 2\n\n2\n\n\fsuch that j A, B > j c drives the conductors A,B normal. Here t=T/Tco is the dimensionless\nreduced temperature. This naturally leads to a universal temperature-current phase\ndiagram as shown in Figure 1, and gives equipartition at N-S transition as follows.\n\nS\n\nN\n\nFigure 1.\nCurrent-Temperature phase diagram showing approach to\nequipartition jA=jB=j/2 at the reduced critical temperature tc. Here jA and jB\nare the normalized currents in the parallel conductors A and B, and jC(t) is the\nnormalized critical current. Here tco is the thermodynamic transition\ntemperature at zero current.\n\nStart well below the N-S transition with an arbitrary supercurrent (j) division, j = jA + jB,\nbetween the two conductors A and B connected in parallel with jA>jB, say. In the plot\n(see Fig. 1) we have taken jA= 0.02 and jB = 0.01 with the total current j = 0.03. (Recall\nthat in the present treatment with the conductors having equal cross-sectional areas, the\ncurrent is the same as the current density). The thermodynamic critical current (density)\njC(t), however, is a material specific property, and its temperature dependence is given by\nEq.(6). Now, as the temperature is raised towards criticality (tco), the critical current\ndecreases monotonically towards zero. Inasmuch as jA>jB, we must have the line jA meet\nthe curve jC(t) first as shown in Fig. 1. Thereafter, jA must necessarily remain equal to and\nfollow the critical current jC(t). Thus, jA and jC(t) decrease together with increasing\ntemperature along the thick line as shown in the figure. The constraint jA + jB = j\n(constant) then requires jB to rise and eventually meet the thick line at the \"equipartition\npoint\" at t = tco as marked in the figure. Finally, for t>tco, of course, both the conductors A\nand B are driven normal, and the current division necessarily jumps to the Ohmic\nsubdivision in the normal state. Thus, the supercurrent equipartition at the transition\npoint (tco) is a universal consequence of the N-S criticality.\n\n3\n\n\fSome general remarks are in order now. The above Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological\ntreatment should hold for both, the type-I as well as the type-II superconductors having\nsharp N-S transition. For systems with broad transition, e.g., granular superconductors, a\nmore detailed treatment will be required that takes into account the flux de-pinning and\nflux flow in particular. This should be particularly interesting as it may be possible then\nto track the fine structure of approach to equipartition at the transition. Further, it should\nbe noted that we have assumed the transverse dimensions of the conductors to be much\nsmaller than the coherence length and the penetration depth. This condition should\ncertainly hold close to the transition point. This would imply no flux trapping in the loop\nformed by the two conductors in parallel. Much below the transition, however, the flux\ntrapping is expected for thick conductors leading to metastable states, i.e., the current\ndivision will depend on whether the conductors are pre-cooled before impressing the\ncurrent from an external source, or the sample is post-cooled after the current has been\nimpressed.\nIn conclusion, we have given an order parameter phenomenological treatment for the\nequipartition of supercurrent between two conductors connected in parallel as the N-S\ntransition is approached from below. The treatment can be readily generalized to include\nany number of parallel conductors. We should also add that similar equipartition should\nclearly hold for superfluid HeII flowing through capillaries in parallel.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT.
