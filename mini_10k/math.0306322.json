Let A be an integral domain with field of fractions K. We\ninvestigate the structure of the overrings B \u2286 K of A that are wellcentered on A in the sense that each principal ideal of B is generated\nby an element of A. We consider the relation of well-centeredness to the\nproperties of flatness, localization and sublocalization for B over A. If\nB = A[b] is a simple extension of A, we prove that B is a localization of\nA if and only if B is flat and well-centered over A. If the integral closure\nof A is a Krull domain, in particular, if A is Noetherian, we prove that\nevery finitely generated flat well-centered overring of A is a localization\nof A. We present examples of (non-finitely generated) flat well-centered\noverrings of a Dedekind domain that are not localizations.\n\n1. Introduction.\nAll rings we consider here are assumed to be commutative with unity. If\nR is a ring, we denote by U (R) the multiplicative group of units of R. If A\n\nis an integral domain with field of fractions K, we refer to a subring B of\nK with A \u2286 B as an overring of A.\n\nFix an integral domain A with field of fractions K and an overring B of\n\nA.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13A15, 13B30, 13G05 .\nKey words and phrases. flat extension, localization, overring, sublocalization, wellcentered.\n1\nPart of this work was prepared while M. Roitman enjoyed the hospitality of Purdue\nUniversity.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nWe say that B is well-centered on A if for each b \u2208 B there exists a unit\n\nu \u2208 B such that ub = a \u2208 A. Thus, B is well-centered on A iff each element\n\nof B is an associate in B of an element of A iff each principal ideal of B is\ngenerated by an element of A.\nThe overring B of A is a localization of A if B = S \u22121 A = AS , where S\nis a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzero elements of A. Thus B is a\nlocalization of A iff B = AU (B)\u2229A . A localization of A is both flat over A\nand well-centered on A. Conversely, we prove in Theorem 4.3 that a simple\nflat well-centered overring of an integral domain A is a localization of A. If\nthe integral closure of A is the intersection of a family of valuation domains\nof finite character, we prove in Theorem 4.15 that every finitely generated\nflat well-centered overring of A is a localization of A. Thus every finitely\ngenerated flat well-centered overring of an integral domain A which is either\nKrull or Noetherian is a localization of A (Corollary 4.16). On the other\nhand, we establish in Theorem 3.16 the existence of non-finitely generated\nflat well-centered overrings of a Dedekind domain that are not localizations.\nThe overring B of A is a sublocalization of A if B is an intersection of\nlocalizations of A. Thus B is a sublocalization of A if and only if there exists\na family {S\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of multiplicatively closed subsets of nonzero elements of\nT\nA such that B = \u03bb\u2208\u039b AS\u03bb . It is well-known [32], [12] that a sublocalization B of A is an intersection of localizations of A at prime ideals. Indeed\nT\nT\n{AP : P \u2208 Spec A and P \u2229 S\u03bb = \u2205 for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} (see\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b AS\u03bb =\nDiscussion (2.1)).\n\nA sublocalization B of A need be neither well-centered on A nor flat\nover A. We discuss in \u00a72 the sublocalization condition in relation to the\nproperties of flatness and well-centeredness for an overring B of A. We give\n\nin Corollary 2.8 necessary and sufficient conditions for each sublocalization\noverring of a Noetherian domain A to be a localization of A.\nWe prove in Theorem 3.6 that every finitely generated well-centered overring of an integrally closed domain is flat and therefore, in particular, a sublocalization. In Example 3.24 we establish the existence of a non-archimedean\nwell-centered overring of a factorial domain.\nOur interest in the well-centered property of an overring of an integral\ndomain A arose from conversations that the first author had with Jack\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n3\n\nOhm a number of years ago. The property arises naturally in relation to\nresults established by Ohm in Theorem 5.1 and Example 5.3 of [26]. M.\nGriffin in [16, page 76] defines well-centeredness of a valuation v with ring\nB containing the domain A in a manner equivalent to the definition of B\nbeing well-centered on A given above. We thank Muhammad Zafrullah for\npointing out to us this reference to Griffin. We also thank the referee for\nseveral helpful suggestions that have improved the paper.\n2. When a sublocalization is flat or a localization.\nInteresting work on the structure of flat overrings of an integral domain\nhas been done by Richman in [32] and Akiba in [1]. Richman observes\nthat an overring B of A is a flat A-module if and only if BM = AM \u2229A for\nevery maximal (or equivalently prime) ideal M of B [32, Theorem 2]. In\nparticular, if B is a flat overring of A then B is a sublocalization of A. The\nconverse of this result, however, is not true in general. We indicate below\nmethods for obtaining sublocalizations B of A that fail to be flat over A.\nDiscussion 2.1. (1) If B is a flat overring of A, then every ideal J of\nB is extended from A. Indeed, for each maximal ideal M of B we have\nBM = AM \u2229A , hence JBM = JAM \u2229A = (J \u2229 A)AM \u2229A = ((J \u2229 A)B)BM .\nThus J = (J \u2229 A)B. It is not true, however, that a flat overring B of an\n\nintegral domain A need be well-centered on A (cf. Proposition 3.13 and\n\nExample 4.6). The distinction is that principal ideals of a flat overring B\nneed not be the extension of principal ideals of A.\n(2) If S is a multiplicatively closed subset of an integral domain A with\n0 6\u2208 S, then\n\nAS =\n\n\\\n\n{AP : P \u2208 Spec A and P \u2229 S = \u2205}.\n\nTherefore if {S\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b is a family of multiplicatively closed sets of nonzero\nT\nelements of A and B = \u03bb\u2208\u039b AS\u03bb , then\n\\\nB = {AP : P \u2208 Spec A and P \u2229 S\u03bb = \u2205 for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039b}.\nThus B is a sublocalization over A if and only if\n\\\nB = {AP : P \u2208 Spec A and B \u2286 AP }.\nIn contrast with this characterization of a sublocalization, the condition for\neach P \u2208 Spec A that either P B = B or B \u2286 AP is, in general, stronger\n\n\f4\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nthan the sublocalization property. Indeed, by [32, Theorem 1], this latter\nproperty is equivalent to flatness of B over A. Thus every flat overring is\na sublocalization. Hence every flat overring of an integrally closed domain\nis again integrally closed [32, Corollary, page 797]. Also from Richman's\ncharacterization that B is a flat overring of A iff for each Q \u2208 Spec B, we\nhave BQ = AQ\u2229A [32, Theorem 2], it follows that if B is a quasilocal flat\n\noverring of A, then B is a localization of A.\n(3) A useful observation is that if an overring B \u2286 K of A has one of the\n\nproperties of being flat, well-centered, a localization, or a sublocalization\n\nover A, then for each subring C of B with A \u2286 C, it follows that B as\n\nan extension of C is, respectively, flat, well-centered, a localization, or a\nsublocalization. This is easily seen in each case.\n(4) If B is a flat overring of A and C is a subring of B with A \u2286 C such\n\nthat B is integral over C, then C = B. For in this case B is a flat integral\noverring of C, so by [32, Prop. 2], C = B.\n\n(5) The localization, well-centered and flatness properties are transitive\nin the sense that if B is an overring of A and C is an overring of B, then\none of these properties holding for B over A and for C over B implies the\nproperty also holds for C over A.\n(6) The localization and flatness properties also behave well with respect\nto compositum in the following sense: for an arbitrary overring C \u2286 K of\n\nA, if B is a localization or a flat overring of A, then C[B] is, respectively, a\nlocalization or a flat overring of C. For if B = S \u22121 A, then C[B] = S \u22121 C,\nwhile for flatness if Q \u2208 Spec C[B] and P = Q \u2229 B, then BP = AP \u2229A implies\n\nC[B]Q = CQ\u2229C .\n\nIt would be interesting to know precise conditions for a Noetherian integral domain to admit a non-Noetherian sublocalization overring. In Corollary 2.8, we describe the class of Noetherian domains A for which each sublocalization over A is a localization of A. In particular, a Noetherian domain\nin this class does not admit a non-Noetherian sublocalization overring.\nWe begin with more general considerations. We use Rad I to denote the\nradical of an ideal I.\nDiscussion 2.2. If R is a ring, we define P \u2208 Spec R to be an associated\n\nprime of an ideal I of R if there exists a \u2208 R such that P is a minimal\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n5\n\nprime over (I :R a) = {r \u2208 R : ra \u2208 I} [4, page 289], [21, page 92], [5]. An\n\nintegral domain A has the representation\n\\\nA = {AP : P is an associated prime of a principal ideal of A}\n\n[5, Prop. 4]. Moreover, if each principal ideal of A has only finitely many\nassociates primes, then by [5, Prop. 4] for S a multiplicatively closed subset\nof A, we have\n\\\nAS = {AP : P is an associated prime of a principal ideal and P \u2229S = \u2205}.\nLemma 2.3. Let P be a prime ideal of an integral domain A. Then the\nfollowing three properties are equivalent:\n(1) For each family Q of prime ideals of A, if P \u2286\nfor some Q \u2208 Q.\n\nS\n\nQ\u2208Q Q,\n\nthen P \u2286 Q\n\n(2) For each family Q of minimal primes over principal ideals of A, if\nS\nP \u2286 Q\u2208Q Q, then P \u2286 Q for some Q \u2208 Q.\n\n(3) P is the radical of a principal ideal.\nProof. (1 =\u21d2 (2)\nObvious.\n\n(2) =\u21d2 (1)\nS\nLet P \u2286 Q\u2208Q Q, where Q is a set of prime ideals. Thus P is contained in\n\nthe union of the set M of all minimal primes over principal ideals contained\n\nin one of the primes Q \u2208 Q. Hence P is contained in some prime in M\nwhich is contained in a prime Q \u2208 Q.\n(1) =\u21d2 (3)\n\nLet Q be the set of prime ideals of A that do not contain P . Thus\nS\nS\nP * Q\u2208Q Q. Let c be an element in P \\ Q\u2208Q Q. Since P and Ac are\ncontained in the same prime ideals, it follows that P = Rad(Ac).\n(3) =\u21d2 (1)\nAssume that P = Rad(Ac) for some element c \u2208 A. Let Q be a family of\nS\nprime ideals of A so that P \u2286 Q\u2208Q Q. Thus c \u2208 Q for some prime ideal\nQ \u2208 Q, which implies that P \u2286 Q.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe generalize below the theorem for Dedekind domains stated on page 257\nof [11] (see [15]).\n\n\f6\n\nW.

Let A be an integral domain with field of fractions K. Each\nsublocalization over A is a localization of A if and only if for each x \u2208 K \\A,\nthe ideal Rad(A :A x) is the radical of a principal ideal.\n\nMoreover, if each principal ideal of A has only finitely many associated\nprimes, then each sublocalization of A is a localization iff each associated\nprime of a principal ideal is the radical of a principal ideal.\nProof. If each ideal of the form Rad(A :A x) is the radical of a principal\nideal, then each sublocalization of A is a localization by Theorem 2.4.\nConversely, assume that each sublocalization of A is a localization of A.\nLet x \u2208 K \\ A. By Theorem 2.4, (A :A x) is not contained in the union of\n\nthe prime ideals not containing (A :A x). Let c be an element in (A :A x)\n\nthat does not belong to this union. Thus (A :A x) and Ac are contained in\nthe same prime ideals, which implies that Rad(A :A x) = Rad(Ac).\nAssume now that each principal ideal of A has only finitely many associated primes, and that each sublocalization of A is a localization. Let P be\na prime associated with a principal ideal of A. By Theorem 2.4, P is not\ncontained in a union of primes not containing P . Hence, by Lemma 2.3, P\nis the radical of a principal ideal.\nConversely, if each principal ideal of A has only finitely many associated\nprimes and if each associated prime of a principal ideal is the radical of a\nprincipal ideal, then each sublocalization of A is a localization by Theorem\n2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe apply the above results to various classes of integral domains. In\nCorollary 2.7 we describe the class of Mori domains and the class of semiKrull domains for which each sublocalization is a localization. In Corollary\n2.8 we characterize the Noetherian domains having this property.\nWe recall that A is a Mori domain if A satisfies the ascending chain condition on integral divisorial ideals [2]. In particular, a Mori domain satisfies\nthe ascending chain condition on principal ideals (a.c.c.p.). Examples of\nMori domains include factorial and Krull domains as well of course as NoeT\ntherian domains. An integral domain A is semi-Krull [23], if A = P AP ,\nwhere P ranges over the set of height-one primes of A, this intersection has\nfinite character, and for each height-one prime P , every nonzero ideal of AP\ncontains a power of P AP .\n\n\f8\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nA nonzero prime ideal of a Mori domain or a semi-Krull domain is an\nassociated prime of a principal ideal iff it is a prime divisorial ideal (see\n[2, Theorem 3.2] and [3, Theorem 1.7]). Thus by Discussion 2.2, if AS is\na localization of a Mori domain A or a semi-Krull domain A, then AS =\nT\nP \u2208P AP , where P is the set of prime divisorial ideals P \u2208 Spec A such that\n\nP \u2229 S = \u2205. Therefore if B is a sublocalization over A, then B has the form\nT\nB = P \u2208P AP , where P is a set of prime divisorial ideals in A.\nTheorem 2.4 implies:\n\nCorollary 2.6.

Let A be a Noetherian integral domain. Each sublocalization\nover A is a localization of A if and only if each associated prime of a principal\nideal of A is the radical of a principal ideal. In particular, if A has these\nequivalent properties, then nonzero principal ideals of A have no embedded\nassociated primes.\nA Krull domain has torsion divisor class group iff each prime divisorial\nideal (that is, prime ideal of height one) is the radical of a principal ideal.\nHence Corollary 2.7 implies:\nCorollary 2.9. A Krull domain A has torsion divisor class group if and if\nevery sublocalization over A is a localization of A.\nCorollary 2.10. Let A be a one-dimensional integral domain. If each maximal ideal of A is the radical of a principal ideal, then every sublocalization\nover A is a localization of A. The converse holds if A has Noetherian prime\nspectrum.\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n9\n\nProof. A commutative ring has Noetherian spectrum iff each prime ideal is\nthe radical of a finitely generated ideal [27]. Thus a one-dimensional integral\ndomain has Noetherian spectrum iff each nonzero element is contained in\nonly finitely many maximal ideals iff principal ideals have only finitely many\nassociated primes. Thus Corollary 2.10 follows from Theorem 2.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nQuestion 2.11. What (Noetherian) integral domains A have the property\nthat every sublocalization extension is flat?\nFor a one-dimensional integral domain with Noetherian spectrum we give\nin Theorem 2.12 a complete answer to Question 2.11.\nTheorem 2.12. Suppose A is a one-dimensional integral domain with Noetherian spectrum. Then every sublocalization over A is flat over A.\nProof. Let B be a sublocalization over A. We may assume that B ( K,\nwhere K is the field of fractions of A. By Discussion 2.1 (2), there exists a\nT\nfamily {P\u03b1 } of prime ideals of A such that B = \u03b1 AP\u03b1 . Since dim A = 1,\n\nwe may assume that each P\u03b1 is a maximal ideal of A. Let Q\u03b1 = P\u03b1 AP\u03b1 \u2229 B.\nT\nWe have BQ\u03b1 = AP\u03b1 and B = \u03b1 BQ\u03b1 . Since A has Noetherian spectrum,\nthe family {BQ\u03b1 } has finite character in the sense that a nonzero element of\nB is a unit in all but finitely many of the BQ\u03b1 . To prove that B is flat over\n\nA, we show for each maximal ideal Q of B that BQ = AQ\u2229A . Let P = Q \u2229 A\nT\nand let S = A \\ P . By [18, Lemma 1.1] we have S \u22121 B = \u03b1 (S \u22121 BQ\u03b1 ).\nSince BQ\u03b1 is a one-dimensional quasilocal domain, S \u22121 BQ\u03b1 is either BQ\u03b1 if\n\nS \u2229 Q\u03b1 6= \u2205 or K otherwise. Since AP\u03b1 = BQ\u03b1 , we see that Q\u03b1 is the unique\nprime of B lying over P\u03b1 . Thus if Q 6= Q\u03b1 , then S \u2229 Q\u03b1 is nonempty and\nT\nS \u22121 BQ\u03b1 = K. If this were true for each \u03b1, then S \u22121 B = \u03b1 S \u22121 BQ\u03b1 = K,\n\nbut clearly S \u22121 B \u2286 BQ , a contradiction. Hence Q = Q\u03b1 for some \u03b1 and\ntherefore AP = BQ .\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Properties of flat and well-centered overrings.\nRichman observes [32, Theorem 3] that a flat overring of a Noetherian\ndomain is Noetherian. There exist Noetherian integral domains with nonNoetherian sublocalizations that are ideal transforms ([7] and [8, Theorem\n3.2]). If B is a non-Noetherian ideal transform of a Noetherian domain\nA, then B is not flat over A by the result of Richman mentioned above.\n\n\f10\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nProposition 3.1 shows that B with these properties also fails to be wellcentered on A.\nProposition 3.1. A well-centered extension of a Noetherian domain is Noetherian.\nProof. If B is well-centered on A, then every ideal of B is the extension of\nan ideal of A. Thus if A is Noetherian, then every ideal of B is finitely\ngenerated and B is also Noetherian.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe observe in Theorem 3.6 that a finitely generated well-centered overring\nof an integrally closed domain is a flat extension. In the proof of this result\nwe use Proposition 3.2 which holds for arbitrary well-centered extension\nrings.\nProposition 3.2. Let S be a well-centered extension ring of a ring R. If\nM is a maximal ideal of R such that M S 6= S, then M S is a maximal ideal\n\nof S.\n\nProof. We have a natural embedding R/M \u0592\u2192 S/M S. Moreover the fact\nthat S is well-centered over R implies that S/M S is well-centered over R/M .\nSince a well-centered extension of a field is a field, S/M S is a field and M S\nis a maximal ideal of S.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor an extension ring S of a ring R, we consider the following condition\nthat is in general weaker than the well-centered property.\nDefinition 3.3. An extension ring S of a ring R is said to be almost wellcentered on R if for each s \u2208 S there exists a positive integer n depending\non s and an element u \u2208 U(S) such that usn \u2208 R.\n\nThe following remark concerning almost well-centered extensions is clear.\nRemark 3.4. If S is an almost well-centered extension ring of a ring R,\nthen for each ideal J of S we have Rad J = Rad(J \u2229 R)S.\nIn view of Remark 3.4, we have the following analogue of Proposition 3.2.\nProposition 3.5. Let S be an almost well-centered extension ring of a ring\nR. If M is a maximal ideal of R such that M S 6= S, then Rad M S is a\nmaximal ideal of S.\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n11\n\nTheorem 3.6. If B is a finitely generated almost well-centered overring of\nA and if A is integrally closed in B, then B is flat over A. In particular,\nevery finitely generated almost well-centered overring of an integrally closed\ndomain A is flat over A.\nProof. Let Q be a maximal ideal of B and let P = Q \u2229 A. By Proposition\n\n3.5, Rad(P B) = Q. The Peskine-Evans version of Zariski's Main Theorem\n\n[30], [9] implies there exists s \u2208 A \\ P such that As = Bs . In particular,\nAP = BQ . Thus B is flat over A.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.7. If B = A[u] is a simple overring of A, where u is a unit\nof B, and if A is integrally closed in B, then B is a localization of A.\nProof. Since u\u22121 \u2208 B it follows that u\u22121 is integral over A [19, Theorem\n15]. Thus u\u22121 \u2208 A and B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.8. A simple almost well-centered overring of an integrally\nclosed domain is a localization.\nProof. Let B = A[b] be a simple almost well-centered overring of an integrally closed domain A. By Theorem 3.6, B is flat over A. Since B is almost\nwell-centered over A, there exist a positive integer n and a unit u \u2208 U (B)\nsuch that ubn = a \u2208 A. Thus B is a flat integral overring of A[bn ] = A[u].\nBy Discussion 2.1 (4), B = A[u] and B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.8 may fail if A is not integrally closed. We\nuse Proposition 3.9 to show in Example 3.10 the existence of Noetherian\nintegral domains that admit simple proper well-centered integral overrings.\nCorollary 2.8 shows that in an integral domains having this property there\nare principal ideals with embedded associated prime ideals.\nProposition 3.9. Let B be an integral domain of the form B = K + M ,\nwhere K is a field and M is a nonzero maximal ideal of B. If A is a subring\nof B such that M \u2282 A, then B is well-centered on A.\nProof. Let b \u2208 B. Then b = k + m, where k \u2208 K and m \u2208 M . If k = 0,\n\nthen b \u2208 A. If k 6= 0, then k is a unit of B and a := b/k = 1 + (m/k) \u2208 A.\n\nHence B is well-centered over A.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nExample 3.10. A simple well-centered integral (thus not flat) proper overring B of a Noetherian integral domain A such that B is a sublocalization of\nA. Moreover, each height-one prime of A is the radical of a principal ideal.\nLet E = F (c) be a simple proper finite algebraic field extension, let B\nbe the localized polynomial ring E[X, Y ](X,Y ) , let M = (X, Y )B, and let\nA = F + M . Then A is Noetherian and B = A[c] is a simple, proper\nintegral extension of A. Hence B is not flat as an A-module [32, Prop. 2].\nProposition 3.9 implies that B is well-centered on A.\nSince B is factorial, B is the intersection of the rings BQ as Q ranges over\nthe nonzero principal prime ideals of B. For such Q we have Q ( M \u2282 A,\n\nthus B \u2286 AQ , so BQ = AQ . It follows that B is a sublocalization over\n\nA. Since B is a unique factorization domain, each height-one prime of B\n\nis principal. Since M \u2282 A, each height-one prime of A is the radical of a\nprincipal ideal.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following example where B is not well-centered on A illustrates restrictions on generalizing Proposition 3.9. The original Example 3.11, as\nnoticed by Jung-Chen Liu and her student Jing-Ping Tsai, is wrong. We\nprovide here a correct example for the same statement (actually, a little\nimprovement since in the new version M is a maximal ideal of both A and\nB).\nExample 3.11. Integral domains of the form A = A0 + M \u2286 B = B0 + M ,\n\nwhere A0 , B0 are subrings of A and B, respectively, and M is a maximal\nideal of B such that B is not almost well-centered on A.\n\nLet X be an indeterminate over the field Q of rational numbers and let\nB = B0 = Q[X]. Let M = (X 2 \u2212 2)B, A0 = Q and A = A0 + M . Clearly, M\n\nis a maximal ideal of both A and B = B0 +M . No power of X +1 is associate\n\nin B with an element of A; otherwise, since U (B) = Q r {0}, we obtain that\n\u221a\nsome power of X + 1 is in A: (X + 1)n \u2208 Q + (X 2 \u2212 2)Q[X]. Put X \u2192 2 in\n\u221a\norder to obtain the contradiction ( 2 + 1)n \u2208 Q (for the binomial expansion\n\u221a\nimplies ( 2 + 1)n \u2208\n/ Q). Thus B is not almost well-centered over A.\n\u0003\nDiscussion 3.12. Let B be an overring of an integral domain A and let\nS = U (B) \u2229 A. Then B = BS is a well-centered overring of AS if and only if\n\nB is a well-centered overring of A. Moreover, U (AS ) = U (BS ) \u2229 AS , and B\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n13\n\nis a localization of A if and only if AS = B. Thus in considering the question\nof whether an overring B of an integral domain A is a localization of A, by\npassing from the ring A to its localization AU (B)\u2229A , we may assume that\nU (B) \u2229 A = U (A). The localization question is then reduced to the question\n\nof whether A = B. In general, if B is a well-centered overring of A which\nproperly contains A, then U (A) ( U (B). For if b \u2208 B \\ A and u \u2208 U (B) is\n\nsuch that ub \u2208 A, then u\u22121 6\u2208 A so u \u2208 U (B) \\ U (A).\n\nIf A is a Dedekind domain, then every overring B of A is a flat A-module,\nthus a sublocalization over A. Moreover, we have:\nProposition 3.13. Let A be a Dedekind domain. The following conditions\nare equivalent:\n(1) A has torsion divisor class group.\n(2) Every overring of A is a localization of A.\n(3) Every overring of A is well-centered on A.\n(4) A has no proper simple overring with the same set of units.\nProof. (1) \u21d0\u21d2 (2) : By Corollary 2.9, (2) holds if and only if each maximal\n\nideal of A is the radical of a principal ideal, and this is equivalent to (1).\n\nIt is clear that (2) =\u21d2 (3) and (3) =\u21d2 (4). Thus it remains to show:\n(4)\n\n=\u21d2 (2) : Assume that (2) does not hold. Then A has a maximal\n\nideal P that is not the radical of a principal ideal. We claim that B = A[P \u22121 ]\nis a simple flat overring of A with U (B) = U (A). Indeed, if b \u2208 P \u22121 \\ A,\nT\nwe have B = A[b] since both of these rings are equal to {AQ : Q \u2208\nSpec A and Q 6= P }. Suppose there exists an element u \u2208 U (B) \\ U (A).\n\nThen u is not a unit in AP , but either u or u\u22121 is in AP . We may assume that\nu \u2208 AP , thus u \u2208 P AP . Then u \u2208 A and Rad uA = P , a contradiction.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe show in Theorem 4.5 that if B is a finitely generated overring of a\nDedekind domain A, then B is a localization of A iff B is well-centered on\nA iff B is almost well-centered on A. However, for overrings of a Dedekind\ndomain having nontorsion class group, we present in Theorem 3.16 examples\nof well-centered overrings that are not localizations and examples of almost\nwell-centered overrings that are not well-centered.\nIf A is a Dedekind domain, we denote its class group by C(A); if I is a\n\nnonzero fractional ideal of A, we denote the ideal class of I by C A (I), and\n\n\f14\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nif P is a subset of Max A, we denote the set {C A (P ) | P \u2208 P} by C A (P).\n\nThe complement of a subset P of Max A is denoted by P c . We denote the\n\nsubmonoid generated by a subset S of a monoid by M(S), and the subgroup\ngenerated by a subset S of a group by G(S). Thus, if S is a set of nonzero\n\nfractional ideals of a Dedekind domain A viewed as a subset of the ideal\nmonoid of A, we have M(CA (S)) = C A (M(S)).\n\nWe recall that if A is a Dedekind domain, and B is an overring of A, then\nT\nthere exists a unique set of maximal ideals P in A such that B = {AP :\nP \u2208 P}. The overring B of A can also be described as the compositum of\n\nthe overrings A[Q\u22121 ] such that Q \u2208 Max A \\ P. Thus for each Q \u2208 Max A\nwe have QB = B if and only if Q \u2208 P c .\n\nProposition 3.14. Let A be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions K\nand let B ( K be an overring of A, thus\n\\\nB = {AP : P \u2208 P}.\nfor a unique subset P of Max A. Let J be a nonzero ideal of B. Then\nJ = IB where I is an ideal of A belonging to M(P)). Moreover, we have\n(1) J is a principal ideal of B \u21d0\u21d2 C A (I) \u2208 G(C A (P c )).\n\n(2) J is an extension of a principal ideal of A \u21d0\u21d2 C A (I) \u2208 \u2212 M(CA (P c )).\nProof. Part (1) follows from [6, Corollary 3]. For part (2), assume first that\nthere exists a principal ideal I0 of A such that IB = I0 B. Since I \u2208 M(P),\n\nit follows that I0 = II1 , where I1 \u2208 M(P c ). Thus C A (I) = \u2212 C A (I1 ) \u2208\n\n\u2212 M(C A (P c )).\n\nConversely, let C A (I) \u2208 \u2212 M(C A (P c )).

We will use the well known result of Claborn [6] that every Abelian\ngroup is the ideal class group of a Dedekind domain, along with the fact\nthat for a countably generated Abelian group G and a nonempty subset\nS of G, there exists a Dedekind domain A with class group G such that\nS = {C(P ) : P \u2208 Max A} if and only if S generates G as a monoid [14,\n\nTheorem 5].\n\nLet A be a Dedekind domain having ideal class group the infinite cyclic\ngroup Z. Define\nB=\n\n\\\n{AQ : Q \u2208 Max A and C(Q) \u2264 0}.\n\nSince the set {C(P ) : P \u2208 Max A} generates Z as a monoid, there exists\n\nP \u2208 Max A with C(P ) > 0. Thus B is a proper overring of A. For a nonzero\n\nnonunit a \u2208 A, if aA = P1e1 * * * Pnen is the factorization of the principal ideal\n\naA as a product of maximal ideals, then 0 = e1 C(P1 ) + * * * + en C(Pn ).\n\nTherefore C(Pi ) \u2264 0 for at least one of the Pi . It follows that A \\ U (A) =\nS\n{Q : Q \u2208 Max A and C(Q) \u2264 0}. Since the maximal ideals of B lie over\nS\nthe ideals Q of A with C(Q) \u2264 0, we see that B \\ U (B) = {QB : Q \u2208\nMax A and C(Q) \u2264 0}, hence U (B) \u2229 A = U (A).\n\nBy Corollary 3.15, B is almost well-centered on A: indeed, since there\n\nexists P \u2208 P c with CA (P ) > 0, each element of M(C A (P)) has a power\n\nin \u2212 M(C A (P c )). Moreover, if there exists P \u2208 Max A with C(P ) = 1, by\n\nCorollary 3.15, B is well-centered on A.\n\n\f16\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nTo obtain an example where B is almost well-centered but not wellcentered on A we argue as follows. By [14, Theorem 8], there exists a\nDedekind domain A with class group Z such that {C(P ) : P \u2208 Max A} =\n\n{\u22121, 2, 3}. The overring\n\\\nB = {AQ : Q \u2208 Max A and C(Q) \u2264 0}\n\nis a principal ideal domain, since the primes P \u2208 Max A such that P B = B\n\ngenerate Z as a group. Hence for Q \u2208 Max A with C(Q) = \u22121, we have\n\nQB = bB is a principal ideal that is not generated by an element of A.\n\nNext we show that for each Dedekind domain A with ideal class group\nZ as constructed above, there are precisely two proper almost well-centered\noverrings D of A such that U (D) \u2229 A = U (A). These are the overring B\nT\nas defined above and C = {AP : C(P ) \u2265 0}. A proof that A ( C, C is\n\nalmost well-centered over A, and that U (C) \u2229 A = U (A) is similar to that\ngiven above to show B has these properties. Moreover, if D is an overring of\n\nA such that U(D) \u2229 A = U (A), then either D \u2286 B or D \u2286 C. For otherwise,\n\neither there exists a Q \u2208 Max A with C(Q) = 0 such that QD = D or there\n\nexist P, Q \u2208 Max A with C(P ) = r > 0, C(Q) = \u2212s < 0 and P D = QD = D.\nIn the first case, Q = aA is principal and a \u2208 U(D)\u2229 A\\U(A). In the second\n\ncase P s Qr = aA is principal and again a \u2208 U (D) \u2229 A \\ U (A).\n\nIt remains to show that if A ( D ( B or A ( D ( C, then D is not\n\nalmost well-centered over A. If A ( D ( B, then the ideal class group\nof D is a proper homomorphic image of Z and hence a finite cyclic group,\nthus each nonzero ideal of D has a power that is a principal ideal. Since\nD ( B, there exists P \u2208 Max A with C(P ) < 0 such that P D \u2208 Max D. By\n\nProposition 3.14 (2), no power of P D is an extension of a principal ideal of\nA. Therefore D is not well-centered on A. The proof that an overring D of\nA with A ( D ( C is not well-centered on A is the same. Thus B and C\n\nare the unique proper almost well-centered overrings of A such that every\nnonunit of A remains a nonunit in the overring.\nIf A has no principal maximal ideals, then B and C as defined in the\nprevious paragraph are the unique almost well-centered overrings of A that\nare not localizations of A. For if D is a proper well-centered overring of A\ndistinct from B and C, then there exists a localization E of A such that\nA ( E \u2286 D. Since A has no principal maximal ideals, the ideal class group\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n17\n\nof E is a proper homomorphic image of Z. Therefore E has finite class group\nand every overring of E is a localization of E. Thus D is a localization of\nE and E is a localization of A, so D is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.17. Let A be a Dedekind domain such that each ideal class in\nthe class group C(A) of A contains a maximal ideal. If C(A) is torsionfree,\nthen each overring of A is an intersection of two principal ideal domains\nthat are well-centered overrings of A.\nProof. Let B =\n\nT\n\nP \u2208P\n\nP be an overring of A, where P is a set of maximal\n\nideals of A. Since C(A) is torsionfree it can be linearly ordered. With respect\nT\nto a fixed linear order \u2265 on C(A), define B + = {P \u2208P and CA (P )\u22650} AP and\nT\nB \u2212 = {P \u2208P and CA (P )\u22640} AP . Then B = B + \u2229 B \u2212 , the empty intersection\n\nbeing defined as the field of fractions of A. Since each ideal class of A\ncontains a prime ideal, Proposition 3.14 implies that B + and B \u2212 are wellcentered over A and that each prime ideal of B + and B \u2212 is the extension\n\nof a principal ideal of A. Thus B + and B \u2212 are principal ideal domains that\nare well-centered overrings of A with B = B + \u2229 B \u2212 .\n\n\u0003\n\nIn \u00a74 we use the following well-known general result characterizing flat\n\noverrings, see for example [1, Theorem 1]. The implication (1) =\u21d2 (2) in\nProposition 3.18 holds without assuming that B is an overring of A, cf. [4,\nExer. 22, page 47].\nProposition 3.18. Assume that B is an overring of an integral domain A\nand that S \u2286 B is such that B = A[S]. Then the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n\n(1) B is a flat extension of A.\n(2) For any element s \u2208 S we have (A :A s)B = B.\nIf B is well-centered over A, then B = A[U (B)]. Thus the following\ncorollary of Proposition 3.18 is immediate.\nCorollary 3.19. Assume that B is a well-centered overring of the integral\ndomain A. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) B is a flat extension of A.\n(2) For each unit u \u2208 B we have (A :A u)B = B.\n\n\f18\n\nW. HEINZER AND M.

If B is a localization of an Archimedean domain A such that\nthe conductor of B in A is nonzero, then B = A.\nIndeed, suppose B = AS and let 0 6= a \u2208 (A :A B). Then for each s \u2208 S\n\nwe have a/sn \u2208 A for all n \u2265 1. Since A is Archimedean, it follows that s is\n\na unit in A. Hence B = A.\n\nProposition 3.21. Suppose B is an overring of a Mori integral domain A.\nIf the conductor of B in A is nonzero and B is flat over A, then A = B.\nProof. Since A is Mori and (A :A B) 6= 0, there exists a finite subset F of\n\nB such that (A :A B) = (A :A F ). Since B is flat over A, Proposition 3.18\n\nimplies that (A :A F )B = B, hence (A :A B) = (A :A B)B = B. Therefore\nA = B.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 3.22. If A is not Mori, the conclusion of Proposition 3.21 need\nnot hold.\nIndeed, let k be a field and let R = k[X, Y ] be a polynomial ring over\nk. Then B := R[1/Y ] is a localization of A := R + XB. The conductor\nof B in A contains XB and hence is nonzero. Moreover, A ( B since\nY \u22121 \u2208 B \\ A.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following structural result is proved by Querr\u00e9 in [31].\n\nProposition 3.23. [31] If A is a Mori domain and B is a sublocalization\nover A, then B is also Mori. In particular, a flat overring of a Mori domain\nis again a Mori domain.\nWe observe in Proposition 3.1 that a well-centered overring of a Noetherian domain is Noetherian. Example 3.24 shows that in general the Mori\nproperty is not preserved by well-centered overrings. Indeed, Example 3.24\nestablishes the existence of a polynomial ring A over a field and a wellcentered overring B of A that is not Archimedean. In particular, B fails to\nsatisfy a.c.c.p. and therefore is not Mori.\nExample 3.24. A well-centered overring of a factorial domain (even of a\npolynomial ring over a field) is not necessarily Archimedean.\n\n\fWELL-CENTERED EXTENSIONS\n\n19\n\nLet k be a field and let a, c be two independent indeterminates over k.\nDefine\n\na\n: n \u2265 1}].\ncn\nProceeding inductively, define integral domains Tm for m \u2265 1 as follows: let\nT0 = k[a, c, {\n\nVm = {vm,t : t is a nonzero nonunit in Tm\u22121 } be a set of independent inde-\n\n1\nterminates over Tm\u22121 and define Tm := Tm\u22121 [{vm,t , vm,t\n: vm,t \u2208 Vm }]. Thus\n\nTm is a domain extension of Tm\u22121 obtained by adjoining the indeterminates\nS\nin Vm along with their inverses. Let V = \u221e\nm=1 Vm and define W to be the\nunion of the set {a, c} with the set {tvm,t : vm,t \u2208 V }]. The elements of W\n\nare algebraically independent over k. Thus A := k[W ] is a polynomial ring\nS\nover the field k. Define B := \u221e\nm=1 Tm . Since T0 is an overring of k[a, c], we\nsee that B is an overring of A. Since every element of Tm\u22121 is an associate in\nTm to an element of A, it follows that B is well-centered on A. The domain\nB is not Archimedean since a/cn \u2208 B for all positive integers n although\n\na, c \u2208 B and c is not a unit in B; indeed, c 6\u2208 U (T0 ) and T0 is a retract of B\n\nunder the retraction over T0 that sends each v \u2208 V to 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Finitely generated well-centered extensions.\nThe structure of a simple flat extension S = R[s] = R[X]/I of a commutative ring R is considered in [32], [33], [34], [28], [29]. Richman in [32,\nProp. 3] shows that if A is an integrally closed domain and B = A[a/b]\nis a simple flat overring of A, then (a, b)A is an invertible ideal of A. We\nobserve in Theorems 4.1 that a simple flat overring B generated by a unit\nof B is a localization of A. It follows (Corollary 4.2 and Corollary 4.3) that\nwell-centered simple flat overrings are localizations.\nTheorem 4.1. Let A be an integral domain and let B = A[u] be a simple\nflat overring of A, where u is a unit of B. There exists a positive integer m\nsuch that u\u2212r \u2208 A for all integers r \u2265 m. Thus B is a localization of A.\nProof. Since u\u22121 \u2208 A[u], the element u\u22121 is integral over A, hence A[u\u22121 ]\nis a finitely generated A-module. Since B is a flat extension of A, we have\n\n(A :A A[u\u22121 ])B = B. Hence there exist c0 , . . . , cm \u2208 (A :A A[u\u22121 ]) with\n1 = c0 + c1 u + * * * + cm um . Thus for each integer r \u2265 m we have\nu\u2212r = c0 u\u2212r + c1 u\u2212r+1 + * * * + cm u\u2212r+m \u2208 A.\n\n\f20\n\nW. HEINZER AND M.

Let B = A[b] be a simple flat overring of an integral domain\nA. The following are equivalent.\n(1) B is a localization of A.\n(2) B is well-centered on A.\n(3) B is almost well-centered on A.\n(4) The element b is associate in B with an element of A.\n(5) Some power of b is associate in B with an element of A.\nProof. It is enough to prove (5) =\u21d2 (1). Assume for some positive integer\nn that bn = au with a \u2208 A and u \u2208 U (B). Then bn \u2208 A[u] implies B is a\n\nflat integral overring of A[u]. Therefore B = A[u] [32, Prop. 2]. Hence by\nTheorem 4.1, B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs an immediate consequence of either Theorem 4.1 or Corollary 4.2 we\nhave:\nCorollary 4.3. If B is a simple flat well-centered overring of an integral\ndomain A, then B is a localization of A.\nWe present several additional corollaries of Theorem 4.1 concerning finitely\ngenerated flat overrings.\nCorollary 4.4. Let B be a finitely generated flat overring of an integral domain A and let A\u2032 denote the integral closure of A in B. If B is a localization\nof A\u2032 , then B is a localization of A.\nProof. Since B is finitely generated over A, if B is a localization of A\u2032 , then\nB = A\u2032 [u] where u\u22121 \u2208 A\u2032 . It follows that B = A[u][A\u2032 ] is an integral flat\noverring of A[u]. Therefore B = A[u]. By Theorem 4.1, B is a localization\nof A.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.5. Let A be a Pr\u00fcfer domain with Noetherian spectrum (for\nexample, a Dedekind domain), and let B be a finitely generated overring of\nA.

It is enough to prove (3) =\u21d2 (1). Assume that B is almost wellcentered on A. By [13, Corollary 5.6], B = A[b] is a simple extension. Since\nevery overring of a Pr\u00fcfer domain is flat, we obtain by Corollary 4.2 that B\nis a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn Proposition 3.13, we present examples of Dedekind domains A \u2282 B\n\nsuch that B is a proper simple flat overring of A and U (A) = U (B). Example\n\n4.6 provides a more explicit construction of this type and also shows that\nthe condition that u is a unit in B is essential in Theorem 4.1.\nExample 4.6.

Also U (A) = U(B) =\n\n\u2208 k \\ {0}, m \u2208 Z}. Since A is a localization of the inte-\n\ngrally closed domain k[X, Y, XZ, Y Z], we see that A is integrally closed.\n\nFinally, B is a flat extension of A by Proposition 3.18 since XZ, Y Z \u2208 A\nand the ideal (X, Y )B = B.\n\nQuestion 4.7. Under what conditions on A is every finitely generated wellcentered overring of A a localization of A?\nIf A is Noetherian, it follows from Corollary 4.16 that every finitely generated flat well-centered overring of A is a localization of A. In a situation\nwhere Question 4.7 has a positive answer, it follows that the finitely generated overring is actually a simple extension, for if B is a finitely generated\noverring of A that is a localization of A, then B is a simple extension of A.\nRemark 4.8.

This construction was first introduced by Nagata [24] in his work on\n\nthe 14-th problem of Hilbert. It is clear that B \u2286 C and that C is the\n\nIB-transform of B.

If there exists a finite set F of height-one prime ideals of A such that\nT\nA = B \u2229 P \u2208F AP , then B is a localization of A.\nProof. Since P \u2208 F has height-one, for S a multiplicatively closed subset of\n\nA either S \u22121 AP = AP or S \u22121 AP = K, the field of fractions of A.

After this reduction, we claim that\n\nA = B, i.e., that F = \u2205. Suppose F 6= \u2205. Since B is flat over A, for\nT\neach P \u2208 F we have P B = B. Let c be a nonzero element in P \u2208F P and\nconsider the ring B/cB and its subring R = A/(cB \u2229 A). Since P B = B\n\nand since every minimal prime of the ring R is the contraction of a prime\nideal of B/cB, we have cB \u2229 A * P for each P \u2208 F .

To prove that B is a localization of A, we may assume that\nU (B) \u2229 A = U (A), and then we have to show that A = B.\nSince B is a sublocalization of A, by [5, Prop. 4], B =\n\nT\n\nP \u2208S\n\nAP , where\n\nS is the set of prime ideals P of height 1 of A so that P B 6= B.

Hence by\nTheorem 4.18, B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f26\n\nW. HEINZER AND M. ROITMAN\n\nProposition 4.20. Let B be a well-centered overring of an integral domain\nA. If S is a multiplicative closed subset of A such that A = AS \u2229 B and such\n\nthat BS is a localization of AS , then B is a localization of A.\n\nProof. Let b \u2208 B. There exists an element t \u2208 AS \u2229U (BS ) such that tb \u2208 AS .\n\nWe may assume that t \u2208 A, thus tb \u2208 AS \u2229 B = A. Since t\u22121 \u2208 BS , there\n\nexists s \u2208 S such that st\u22121 \u2208 B. Since B is well-centered over A, there\nexists u \u2208 U (B) such that ust\u22121 = a \u2208 A. Then u = at/s \u2208 AS \u2229 B = A\nand ub = atb/s \u2208 AS \u2229 B = A. We have shown for each b \u2208 B there exists\nu \u2208 A \u2229 U (B) such that ub \u2208 A. Therefore B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.21. Let B be a well-centered overring of an integral domain\nA, let I be a proper ideal of A, and let S = 1+ I. If for each b \u2208 B and c \u2208 I\n\nthere exists an integer n \u2265 1 such that cn b \u2208 A and if BS is a localization\n\nof AS , then B is a localization of A.\n\nProof. The corollary follows from Proposition 4.20 since A = AS \u2229 B.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.22. Every finitely generated flat well-centered overring of a\none-dimensional integral domain A is a localization of A.\nProof. Let B = A[b1 , . . . , bn ] be a finitely generated flat well-centered overT\nring of A and let I = nj=1 (A :A bj ). Then IB = B by flatness. Let\nS = 1 + I. Then IAS is contained in the Jacobson radical of AS . Since\ndim AS \u2264 1, IAS is contained in every nonzero prime ideal of AS . Since\nIB = B, it follows by [32, Theorem 2 or 3], that BS is the field of fractions\nof AS . By Corollary 4.21, B is a localization of A.\n\n\u0003\n\nAn interesting question that remains open is whether a finitely generated\nflat well-centered overring of an integral domain A is always a localization\nof A.\nReferences\n[1] T.
