It has been recently argued that the\nquantum vacuum can possess momentum, that adds up to the momentum of matter. This \"Casimir\nmomentum\" is closely related to the Casimir effect, in which case energy is exchanged. In previous\ntheory it was treated semi-classically. We present a non-relativistic quantum theory for the linear\nmomentum of electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations, considering an harmonic oscillator subject\nto crossed, quasi-static magnetic and electric and coupled to the quantum vacuum. We derive a\ncontribution of the quantum vacuum to the linear pseudo-momentum and give a new estimate for\nthe achievable speed. Our analysis show that the effect exists and that it is finite.\n\nCasimir energy refers to the electromagnetic (EM) energy that shows up when dielectric or metallic objects\ninteract with the quantum vacuum. It is undoubtedly\none of the most fascinating phenomena in physics, with\na rich history in the 20Th century. Casimir forces become\nimportant on sub-micron scales and are thus believed to\nplay an important role in nano-optics [1]. Casimir energy has been the subject of many speculations, such as\nits role in sonoluminescence [2] or in the cosmological\nconstant problem [3].\nThe standard Casimir effect refers to the reduction of\nthe EM zero-point energy when two ideal metallic plates\napproach [4]. Other well-known phenomena related to\nCasimir energy are Van Der Waals and Casimir-Polder\nforces between neutral atoms [5], the Lifshitz forces between dielectric media, and arguably the most famous\namong all, the Lamb shift of atomic levels. Shortly after\nits observation by Lamb in 1947 [6], Bethe explained the\nLamb shift by the change in EM vacuum energy caused\nby the interaction of the atom with the quantum vacuum\n[7, 8]. The Lamb shifts in light atoms are now understood to be basically nonrelativistic QED phenomena, although full relativistic theory, including the contribution\nof several percents due to vacuum polarization, is necessary to come to the extraordinary agreement with experiment, unprecedented in physics. For the two-photon\n1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen, the shift is known\nup to several cycles [9].\nEnergy and momentum are naturally related by relativity. The search for \"Casimir momentum\" seems therefore obvious. In 2004 Feigel [10] proposed a quantum\ncorrection to the momentum of dielectric media exposed\nto static electric and magnetic fields. In this case, classical electrodynamics provides the following expression\nfor the linear momentum of a neutral, polarizable object\nwith mass M ,\nQclass = M v \u2212 \u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is conserved in time, even if the external electric\nfield E0 is varied slowly in time. Here \u03b1(0) is the static\n\npolarizability, with the dimension of a volume. The semiclassical theory of Ref.[10] predicts a strongly diverging\ncontribution of the quantum vacuum to Eq. (1), quite\nsimilar to the one encountered for Casimir energy. Fortunately, spatial gradients of Casimir energy - observable\nas forces - are often found not to diverge. Momentum\nhowever is an observable parameter and the divergence\ndoes pose a problem. It has been suggested that UV divergences are not physical and should disappear into the\nvalues attributed to physical observables, such as inertial\nmass, electric charge or cosmological constant [11]. If this\nis true it is not evident that the prediction of \"Casimir\nmomentum\" found in Ref.[10] will survive or be measurable. An obvious next question is what physical observable will then absorb the UV divergence of Casimir momentum. In this work we provide first answers to these\nquestions. We use the method of mass renormalization\nfirst employed by Bethe and Kramers that results in a\nfinite Casimir momentum of simple quantum objects.\n\nIt is now realized that Casimir momentum emerges\nquite generally in so-called bi-anisotropic media, in which\nalso magnetic fields can induce an electric polarization\n[12, 13]. Except in media exposed to external EM\nfields, bi-anisotropy also occurs in moving dielectric media. This follows from the relativistic transformations\nof EM fields, and shall be discussed elsewhere [14]. In\ngeneral, like spin, bi-anisotropic behavior and Casimir\nmomentum can be viewed as \"remnants\" of special relativity [15] in non-relativistic theory that often suffices to\ndescribe phenomena quantitatively.\n\nWe consider here the following system: a 3D harmonic oscillator - composed of two particles with opposite\ncharge q1 = +e and q2 = \u2212e and masses mi - exposed\nto crossed, homogeneous static EM fields E0 , B0 which\nconstitute our bi-anisotropic object, coupled to the EM\nvacuum. In the Schr\u00f6dinger picture the Hamiltonian is\n\n\f2\ngiven by\n\u0015\n2 \u0014\nX\n\u00012\n1\nH=\npi \u2212 qi At (ri ) \u2212 qi E0 .ri + V (r)\n2mi\ni=1\n(2)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n1\n\u2020\n+\n~\u03c9k ak\u01eb ak\u01eb +\n2\nk\u01eb\n\nwhere At = A0 + A is the total vector potential containing a contribution from the external, static, classical\nmagnetic field, described by the classical vector potential\nA0 (r) = 12 B0 \u00d7 r, and the quantum operator A of the\nEM field. The EM bath will be treated in the Coulomb\ngauge. We will use R = (m1 r1 +m2 r2 )/M and r = r1 \u2212r2\nfor the center of mass position and the inter-particle distance, with conjugate momenta P and p, respectively;\nM = m1 + m2 and \u03bc = (1/m1 + 1/m2 )\u22121 are the total\nand reduced mass. For a harmonic oscillator we can then\nwrite V (r) = 21 \u03bc\u03c902 r2 .\nAs we are looking for momentum, we notice the existence of a conserved pseudo-momentum K that commutes with H [17], even when the electric field is varied\nin time. The electric field is a parameter that can be varied experimentally. This momentum has contributions\nfrom both atom and radiation,\n\u0015\nX \u0014 \u2020\ne\n1\n(3)\nK = P + B0 \u00d7 r +\n~k ak\u01eb ak\u01eb +\n2\n2\nk\u01eb\n\nIt is a pseudo-momentum as it is a constant of the motion only if the external magnetic field B0 is time independent and homogeneous, as we will assume here. Note\nthat we are interested in the change of the total kinetic\nmomentum Pkin of the oscillator in the presence of vacuum, which is not equal to K, neither to P. Yet, because\nK is conserved, even for a slowly time-dependent electric\nfield E0 , it is the appropriate momentum to look at. In\nthe presence of magnetic fields the kinetic and conjugate\nmomenta operators are related by Pkin = P\u2212 e\u2206At with\ne\u2206At = eAt (r1 ) \u2212 eAt (r2 ), so that we can obtain\n\u0015\nX \u0014 \u2020\n1\nK = Pkin + eB0 \u00d7 r + e\u2206A +\n(4)\n~k ak\u01eb ak\u01eb +\n2\nk\u01eb\n\nThe operator e\u2206A = eA(r1 ) \u2212 eA(r2 ) guarantees the\ngauge-invariant contribution of the \"longitudinal\" vacuum field to the pseudo-momentum, in terms of the vector potential A(r) quantized as usual\ni\nh inside a quantizaP\n\u2020 \u2212ikr\nikr\n.\nA\n\u01eb\na\ne\n+\na\ne\ntion volume V , A(r) =\nk\nk\u01eb\nk\u01eb\nk\u01eb\nWe will be obliged to go beyond the electric dipole approximation -in which e\u2206A would be neglected- to treat\nthe high wave numbers of zero-point fluctuations accurately. The last term in Eq. (4) stems from the \"transverse\" electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the atom\n[17].\n\nWe wish to express the expectation value K =\nh\u03a80 |K|\u03a80 i, of the pseudo-momentum in the total ground\nstate |\u03a80 i in terms of the two relevant vectors: the kinetic\nmomentum M v of the oscillator and the magneto-electric\nvector E0 \u00d7 B0 . We will use perturbation theory in the\ncoupling between the magnetoelectric oscillator and the\nEM field, where the small parameter of the expansion\nis the fine structure constant \u03b1. To lowest order, only\nthe emission and subsequent re-absorption of one virtual\nphoton will contribute at this one-loop level of the theory, which will thus be second order perturbation theory.\nIn order to facilitate perturbation theory, we split the\nHamiltonian (2) up as follow,\nH = H0 + HF + W\nH0 =\n\n2 \u0014\nX\ni=1\n\n(5)\n\u0015\n\n\u00012\n1\n1\npi \u2212 qi A0 (ri ) \u2212 qi E0 .ri + \u03bc\u03c902 r2\n2mi\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n1\nHF =\n~\u03c9k a\u2020k\u01eb ak\u01eb +\n2\nk\u01eb\n\nW =\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2212\n\nq2\nqi\n(pi \u2212 qi A0 (ri ))A(ri ) + i A(ri )2\nmi\n2mi\n\nThe operator W represents the perturbation of the quantum vacuum on the atom. The term A2 can be disregarded because it does not couple field and matter, and\nat this order its contribution to K will vanish due to basic\nselection rules. The photon field in free space described\nby HF is well known. Finally, the quantum-mechanics\nof a 3D harmonic oscillator exposed to crossed, homogeneous static EM fields, described by H0 , was discussed in\ndetail and non-perturbationally by Dippel etal [16]. H0\nand HF act in different Hilbert-spaces and the basis will\nbe the direct product of their eigenvectors. As we are\ninterested in the center-of-mass motion of the 3D harmonic oscillator, one key point is the distinction between\nthe center-of-mass and the internal coordinates. Without\nthe quantum vacuum, the pseudo-momentum K reduces\nto,\nQ = Pkin + eB0 \u00d7 r\n\n(6)\n\nwhich commutes with the atomic Hamiltonian. Q is the\nquantum-mechanical operator corresponding to the classical pseudo-momentum Qclass in Eq. (1). For the purpose of this work it is convenient to choose eigenfunctions\nthat simultaneously diagonalize the atomic Hamiltonian\nand the pseudo-momentum Q, labeled by the eigenvalue\nQ0 , as Q appears directly in K as seen by inserting\nEq. (4) into Eq. (6). It will be sufficient to ignore all\ncontributions other than on those linear in either E0 and\nB0 , as indicated by the sign \u224d. In this approximation,\nthe magneto-electric oscillator is unitary equivalent to an\nisotropic harmonic oscillator as expressed by,\n\n\f3\n\n|n, Q0 i \u224d exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\ni\ni\ni\nQ0 * R exp \u2212 (B0 \u00d7 r) * R exp \u2212 p0 * r exp \u2212 p * r0 |\u03c6n i\n~\n2~\n~\n~\n\nn = (nx , ny , nz ), ni = 0, 1, * * * denotes the quantum levels of the oscillator. The first two exponentials on the\nright denote translational momentum of the center of\nmass, and governed by the conjugate momentum P. The\nlast pair of exponentials eliminate the static electric field\nfrom the picture, with the eigenfunctions of the oscillator shifted out of the center of mass over a distance\nr0 = e\u22121 \u03b1(0)(E0 + Q0 \u00d7 B0 /M ), and the reduced momentum shifted by p0 \u224d (2M )\u22121 (m2 \u2212m1 )\u03b1(0)(E0 \u00d7B0 )\nwith \u03b1(0) = e2 /\u03bc\u03c902 the static polarizability of the oscillator. This last feature is reminiscent of bi-anisotropic\nactivity, and will generate a dominant contribution to\nK. Note that it vanishes for m1 = m2 . Due to the static\nmagnetic field, the oscillator states |\u03c6n i are in principle\nstill anisotropic and even in B0 . The anisotropy is estimated by the small parameter eB0 a/(~/a) \u2248 10\u22125 , with\na the atomic size. This anisotropy constitutes corrections\nnonlinear in the applied fields to the final result for the\ntotal momentum. We can therefore neglect it.\nUpon taking the quantum-expectation value of Eq.

The total energy of the\noscillator in the ground state E0 \u224d 32 ~\u03c90 + Q20 /2M is\nminimal when Q0 = 0, i.e. for a finite kinetic momentum.\nIn the absence of the interaction with the quantum\nvacuum, the eigenstates are just the direct products\n|n, Q0 , nk i = |n, QP\n0 i \u2297 |nk i, with unperturbed energies\nEnQ0 nk = EnQ0 + k ~\u03c9k (nk + 21 ).

This term can be seen to affect the inertial\n0\nmass of the atom, by typically 23 ~\u03c9\nc2 in accordance with\nthe equivalence principle of energy and inertia [14]. Its\nUV divergence can be absorbed into the total mass M\nin the same way as will be discussed below for the ME\ndivergences.\nThe second class, represented by the two last contributions in Eq. (8), are actually QED contributions to the\ninduced electrical dipole moment h\u03a80 |er|\u03a80 i of the oscillator, that find their way to the total momentum via the\nclassical expression (1). It is straightforward to calculate\nthese corrections - they actually do not diverge and they\nare relatively small - but we note that if an experimental\nvalue for \u03b1(0) is used to evaluate the \"classical\" contribution, these terms are automatically included. In this\nsense they do not constitute a genuine \"Casimir momentum\".\nThe term e\u2206A in Eq. (4) is a genuine contribution of\nthe vacuum radiation to the pseudo-momentum. It will\nbe seen to generate a momentum linear in E0 \u00d7 B0 by\n\n\f4\nmeans of the second term in Eq. (8) and the third term\nin \u03a9. The following calculation will focus on this contribution. It suffers from a UV divergence, that can be\neliminated by exactly the same mass regularization as\napplied by Bethe in his calculation of the Lamb shift [7].\nIn particular, this procedure establishes that the reduced\nmass featuring in the static polarizability \u03b1(0) = e2 /\u03bc\u03c902\nwill be replaced by the \"observed\" reduced mass. It is\nstraightforward to show that the so-called transverse electromagnetic momentum, represented by the last term of\nEq. (4), does not contribute a net momentum. This follows from selection rules and spatial symmetry.\napply\nthe\nclosure\nrelation\nPWe\n\u22121\n\u22121\n|\u03c6\ni\nh\u03c6\n|\n(E(k)\n+\nE\n)\n=\n(E(k)\n+\nH\n)\nin the\nl\nl\nl\nho\nl\nsecond contribution to K. This generates two terms\ninvolving exponentials with opposite phases that cancel.\nThe contribution from the first term in \u03a9 to K is\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nZ\n~\u03c90\n4\u03b1 ~2\nkdk\n+O\n(9)\n\u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0\n~2 k 2\n3\u03c0 mi\nM c2\n2m + ~ck\ni\n\nwith i = 1, 2. Here we neglect in the denominator the\nDoppler terms Q0 * ~k and p * ~k, generated by the identity eikr Hho (p)e\u2212ikr = Hho (p \u2212 ~k). They provide a\n~\u03c90\n\u22128\n. The leading confinite correction of order Mc\n2 \u223c 10\ntribution diverges logarithmically. In the Bethe theory\nfor the Lamb shift [7] exactly the same kind of divergency was encountered. The two diverging mass-like\nR\n2 2\n2\nterms \u03b4mi = 4\u03b1\nkdk( ~2mki + ~ck)\u22121 - here with re3\u03c0 ~\ncoil effects included - stem from the QED coupling of the\nfree particles 1 and 2 with the quantum vacuum and are\ntherefore naturally interpreted to be part of their intrinsic, observable masses [8]. Two other diverging contributions are generated by the term \u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0 contained\nin Q0 , see (1), in the expression for \u03a9 and add up to\n\u2212\u03b4m1 /M \u2212 \u03b4m2 /M = \u2212\u03b4M /M . Adding up all diverging\nterms we obtain\n\u03bc\u22121 (\u03b4m1 /m1 + \u03b4m2 /m2 \u2212 \u03b4M /M ) = \u03bc\u22122 \u03b4\u03bc = \u2212\u03b4(1/\u03bc)\nSince the static polarizability is proportional to 1/\u03bc,\nthese UV-divergent corrections all disappear into the factor \u03b1(0) of Eq. (1), which thus becomes defined in terms\nof the observed reduced mass \u03bc\u2217 :\ne2\n1 e2\nQ0 \u2212 \u03b4( ) 2 E0 \u00d7 B0 = M v \u2212 \u2217 2 E0 \u00d7 B0\n\u03bc \u03c90\n\u03bc \u03c90\nAll other terms generated by Eq. (8) are finite. In particular, the term involving p0 in \u03a9 generates the following\ncontribution to K:\nm2 \u2212 m1 4\u03b1\nK1 = \u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0\n3\u03c0\n\u0013\nZ \u221e \u0012 2M\nk\nk\n\u2212\n\u00d7 lim\ndk\n\u03b4\u21930 \u03b4\nk 2 /2 + ckm2 /~ k 2 /2 + ~ckm1 /~\nm1\n4\u03b1 m1 \u2212 m2\n.\n(10)\nlog\n= \u2212\u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0\n3\u03c0\nM\nm2\n\nThe UV divergency cancels out, and the integral is finite. Of course part of the k-integral enters the relativistic regime ~k > mi c in which the present theory is not\nvalid. However, by subtracting and adding 2/k to both\nintegrands in Eq. (10) reveals two terms whose range\nof integration is typically mi c/~. This wavenumber was\nused by Bethe to cut off his nonrelativistic theory for\nthe Lamb shift [7]. We will thus adopt the final result\nin Eq. (10) as a \"reasonable\" nonrelativistic estimate for\nthe Casimir momentum. It is nevertheless clear that a\nrelativistic theory is required to get the complete picture\nfor Casimir momentum.\nAll other cross-terms in Eq. (8) contain oscillating\nexponential factors and converge rapidly for k > 1/a,\ni.e. stay in the nonrelativistic regime . They generate\na Casimir momentum that is typically a factor\np\n~\u03c90 /\u03bcc2 \u223c \u03b1 smaller. We obtain,\ns\n\n~\u03c90\n\u03bcc2\n!\n\u0012\n\u00132\n14\n\u2206m\n8 \u03bc\n2\n\u2212 \u221a + \u221a\n+ \u221a\n15 \u03c0\n3 \u03c0 M\n3 \u03c0M\n\nK2 = \u03b1(0)E0 \u00d7 B0 \u03b1\n\u00d7\n\n(11)\n\nWhen both masses are equal, K2 becomes the sole contribution to Casimir momentum, with a relative correction\nof order \u03b12 . For m1 \u226b m2 , K1 dominates. Since it\nis independent on details of the force between the two\nparticles, it is tempting to apply Eq. (10) to the hydrogen atom. With ~\u03c90 = 10 eV, m1 = mp and m2 = me ,\nE0 = 105 V/m and B0 = 17 T, we find for the velocity associated with the classical contribution (1) vcl \u2248 5 \u03bcm/s,\nand a QED correction of 2 % in the same direction; K2\nyields a negligible correction of 0.01 %.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a non-relativistic\nquantum electrodynamic theory for the total of an harmonic oscillator, subject to external classical fields, and\ncoupled to the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. The\nmost important conclusions of this work are that Casimir\nmomentum exists and that its UV divergences are renormalizable. The theory shows it to be basically a nonrelativistic quantity, but that relativistic corrections are\nlikely to be significant, much like in the Lamb shift problem. To our knowledge nor the classical contribution to\nmagneto-electric momentum, neither the QED correction\nhave ever been observed.\nWe are indebted to Geert Rikken for many helpful discussions.
