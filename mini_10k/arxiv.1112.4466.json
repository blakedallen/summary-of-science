We specifically consider relations between the star formation rates and\nmeasurements of dense, as well as total, molecular gas masses. We argue that\nthere is a fundamental empirical scaling relation that directly connects the local\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nstar formation process with that operating globally within galaxies. Specifically,\nthe total star formation rate in a molecular cloud or galaxy is linearly proportional\nto the mass of dense gas within the cloud or galaxy. This simple relation, first\ndocumented in previous studies, holds over a span of mass covering nearly nine\norders of magnitude and indicates that the rate of star formation is directly\ncontrolled by the amount of dense molecular gas that can be assembled within a\nstar formation complex. We further show that the star formation rates and total\nmolecular masses, characterizing both local clouds and galaxies, are correlated\nover similarly large scales of mass and can be described by a family of linear star\nformation scaling laws, parameterized by fDG , the fraction of dense gas contained\nwithin the clouds or galaxies. That is, the underlying star formation scaling law\nis always linear for clouds and galaxies with the same dense gas fraction. These\nconsiderations provide a single unified framework for understanding the relation\nbetween the standard (non-linear) extragalactic Schmidt-Kennicutt scaling law,\nthat is typically derived from CO observations of the gas, and the linear star\nformation scaling law derived from HCN observations of the dense gas.\nSubject headings: Stars: formation, Galaxies: star formation\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKnowledge of the physical factors that control the conversion of interstellar gas into\nstars is of fundamental importance for both developing a predictive physical theory of star\nformation and understanding the evolution of galaxies from the earliest epochs of cosmic\nhistory to the present time. An essential first step to obtaining such knowledge is to establish\nempirically the underlying relation or relationships that most directly connect the rate of\nstar formation in a galaxy to some general physical property of the interstellar gas from\nwhich stars form. A little more than a half-century ago, Schmidt (1959) conjectured that\nthis might take the form of a scaling relation between the rate of star formation and some\npower, n, of the surface density of atomic (HI) gas. From evaluation of the distributions of\nlocal HI gas and stars orthogonal to the Galactic plane, he suggested that n\u2248 2. Subsequent\nstudies comparing the surface densities of OB stars and HII regions with those of atomic gas\nwithin nearby external galaxies produced scaling laws with similar, super-linear, power-law\nindices (e.g., Sanduleak 1969; Hamajima & Tosa 1975).\nBy the 1980s it became clear that molecular, not atomic, clouds were the sites of star\nformation in galaxies. The ability to make sensitive CO molecular-line observations enabled,\nfor the first time, the measurement of total gas surface densities (\u03a3HI+H2 ) in external galaxies\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwhile advancements in infrared and ultraviolet observations led to significant improvements\nin the measurements of star formation rates. Significant effort was then expended by a\nnumber of researchers to systematically measure star formation rates and total gas surface densities in increasingly large samples of galaxies (e.g., Kennicutt 1989 and references\ntherein). These efforts culminated in the study of Kennicutt (1998a) who compiled galaxy\naveraged measurements of star formation rates and gas surface densities for a large sample of\ngalaxies including normal spirals and starbursts. He derived a scaling relation between the\nstar formation rate surface density (\u03a3SF R ) and total gas surface density (\u03a3HI+H2 ) that was\ncharacterized by a power-law index of n \u2248 1.4. This value was shallower than that Schmidt\nand others found for individual galaxies using only atomic gas but still super-linear. Wong\nand Blitz ( 2002), employing spatially resolved observations of seven nearby, molecular rich,\nspiral galaxies, showed that the star formation rate was better correlated with the molecular\nhydrogen surface density, \u03a3H2 , than with the atomic surface density, but still obtained n \u2248\n1.4. More recently, Bigiel et al. (2008) analyzed spatially resolved observations of 18 nearby\ngalaxies containing both atomic rich and molecular rich objects and confirmed that \u03a3SF R\nwas better correlated with \u03a3H2 than \u03a3HI , but they determined that n = 1.0 (\u00b1 0.2) for the\n\u03a3SF R \u2013 \u03a3H2 relation. However, recent observations of M 101 and M 81 have suggested that\nthe index of the scaling law can vary within a galaxy with values of n ranging between 1 and\n2 (Suzuki et al. 2010).\nAmong the more interesting investigations of the extragalactic scaling laws for star\nformation was that of Gao and Solomon (2004) who used molecular-line emission from HCN,\nrather than CO, to trace the molecular gas. They found a linear (n = 1) correlation between\nthe total far-infrared luminosities and the HCN molecular-line luminosities of a large sample\nof star forming galaxies including normal spirals and luminous and ultra-luminous infrared\ngalaxies. Since the total infrared luminosity is a good proxy for the total star formation rate\n(SFR) and the HCN luminosity a good proxy for the total amount of dense (i.e., n(H2 ) \u2265 3\n\u00d7 104 cm\u22123 ) gas in a galaxy, this also implied a linear correlation between the SFR and the\nmass of dense molecular gas.\nThe various determinations of differing power-law indices for the extragalactic star formation scaling relations present a somewhat confused and problematic picture. Particularly\nsince the difference between a linear and non-linear scaling relation can have significant\nconsequences for the theoretical understanding of the star formation process in galaxies.\nTherefore it is important to understand the nature of such differences. Are the different\nscaling relations consistent with each other? Are the differences due to such effects as the\nchoice of the samples studied (e.g., normal spirals vs starbursts, CO rich vs. HI rich galaxies,\ndistant vs. nearby systems, etc.) or the different quantities actually measured (e.g., SFR\nvs. \u03a3SF R , \u03a3HI+H2 vs. \u03a3H2 , or CO vs. HCN, etc.), or the systematic uncertainties in the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nquantities measured (e.g., observational tracers or IMFs adopted for SFR determinations,\nconversion factor for transforming CO measurements into H2 masses, etc.), or some linear\ncombination of all these effects? Do any of these scaling relations represent the fundamental\nunderlying physical relationship that most directly connects star formation activity with\ninterstellar gas?\nSchmidt's original scaling law was determined from observations of the local region of the\nGalaxy. Since our knowledge of the local Milky Way has improved profoundly over the last\nhalf century, it would seem that important insights into the relation between star formation\nand interstellar gas could and should be derived from observations of local star formation\nactivity. In a previous paper (Lada et al. 2010; hereafter Paper I) we presented a study of\nthe star formation activity in a sample of local (d < 0.5 kpc) molecular clouds with total\nmasses between 103 and 105 M\u2299 . We employed infrared extinction measurements derived\nfrom wide-field surveys to determine accurate cloud masses and mass surface densities, and\ncompiled from the literature both ground and space-based infrared surveys of young stellar\nobjects to construct complete inventories of star formation within the clouds of our local\nsample. We found the specific star formation rates (i.e., the star formation rates per unit\ncloud mass) in these clouds to vary by an order of magnitude, independent of total cloud\nmass. However, we also found the dispersion in the specific star formation rate, to be\nminimized (and reduced by a factor of 2-3) if one considers only the mass of molecular gas\ncharacterized by high extinction in calculating the specific star formation rates. As a result\nwe showed that the (total) star formation rate in local clouds is linearly proportional to the\ncloud mass contained above an extinction threshold of AK \u2265 0.8 magnitudes, corresponding\nto a gas surface density threshold of \u03a3H2 \u2248 116 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Similar surface density thresholds\nfor star formation in local clouds have been suggested in other recent studies (e.g., Goldsmith\net al 2008; Heiderman et al. 2010). Given the density stratification of molecular clouds, we\nargued that such surface density thresholds also correspond to volume density thresholds\nof n(H2 ) \u2248 104 cm\u22123 . These findings are consistent with and reinforce those of Wu et al.\n(2005) who had already demonstrated a linear correlation between far-infrared luminosity\nand HCN luminosity (i.e., between SFR and dense gas mass) for more massive and distant\nstar formation regions in the Milky Way.\nThe correspondence between these results and those obtained by Gao and Solomon\n(2004) for external galaxies is intriguing and especially striking because the scalings of the\nGalactic and extragalactic power-law relations, that together span more than nine orders\nof magnitude in cloud mass, agree to within a factor of 2-3. This suggested to us that the\nclose relationship between the star formation rates and the dense gas masses of molecular\nclouds could be the underlying physical relation that connects star formation activity with\ninterstellar gas over vast spatial scales from the immediate vicinity of the sun to the most\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndistant galaxies.\nHowever, if this is so, how does one understand these observations in the context of\nthe classical Schmidt-Kennicutt scaling relations based on CO observations? These classical\nrelations are often super linear and moreover, as Heiderman et al. (2010) point out, they\nunder predict the \u03a3SF R in local regions by factors of 17 - 50 (see also Evans et al. 2009). In\nthis paper we attempt to address this issue by re-examining the extinction observations of\nlocal clouds to include low extinction material and re-examining the CO observations of the\nclouds studied by Gao and Solomon. We show that all the observations can be understood\nwithin a self-consistent framework in which the differences are primarily due to the dense\ngas fractions that characterize the molecular gas being observed, supporting a hypothesis\noriginally put forward by Gao and Solomon (2004).\n\n2.\n\nThe SFR-Molecular Mass Diagram\n2.1.\n\nThe Local Clouds\n\nIn Figure 1 we plot the relation between the (total) star formation rate, SFR, and\ngas mass for the 11 clouds in the Paper I sample. The SFRs are from Table 2 of Paper\nI and are the averaged rates over a timescale of 2 Myrs. However, here we plot for each\ncloud two different masses derived from the infrared extinction measurements. The filled\ncircles represent cloud masses measured above an infrared (K-band) extinction threshold of\n0.8 magnitudes and correspond to the dense gas masses (MDG ) of the clouds. The open\ncircles represent cloud masses measured above a lower infrared extinction threshold of 0.1\nmagnitudes and correspond to the total gaseous masses (MT G ) of the clouds. These latter\nmasses should also approximately correspond to those that would be traced by CO emission,\nwhile the former masses approximately correspond to those that would be traced by HCN\nemission. The parallel dashed lines represent a series of linear relations between SFR and\nmass. The top line is the best fit linear relation for the high extinction (dense gas) masses\n(following Paper I). The two lower lines are the same relation only shifted or scaled in the\nhorizontal direction by one and two orders of magnitude in mass, respectively. We can now\nexpress the star formation scaling law for these clouds as:\nSF R \u2261 \u1e40\u2217 = 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 fDG MG (M\u2299 ) M\u2299 yr \u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere MG is molecular mass measured at a particular extinction threshold and corrected\nfor the presence of Helium and fDG is the fraction of dense gas, i.e., MDG = fDG MG . The\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthree parallel lines correspond to fDG = 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 from left to right, respectively.\nThese scalings essentially represent the fraction of the measured mass that is above the 0.8\nmagnitude extinction threshold or equivalently above a volume density threshold of roughly\nn(H2 ) = 104 cm\u22123 (Paper I). These lines also correspond to lines of constant gas depletion\ntimes of 20 Myr, 200 Myr and 2 Gyr, respectively. For the open symbols on the plot, MG =\nMT G , the total mass of the molecular cloud.\nThe interesting aspect of this plot is that the low extinction (total) masses also appear\nto follow a linear scaling law, similar to that of the high extinction (high density) masses.\nIndeed, a formal least-squares fit to the former data produces a slightly sub-linear index\nvalue of 0.81 \u00b1 0.19. The total cloud masses, MT G , appear to follow and scatter around the\nrelation given by Equation 1, if fDG = 0.1. However the magnitude of the scatter around\nthis linear relation is significantly higher than that for the high extinction masses around\nthe best-fit line given by Equation 1 (i.e., fDG = 1 and MG = MDG ). Star formation occurs\nalmost exclusively in gas characterized by high densities (n(H2 ) > 104 cm\u22123 ; Lada 1992) and\nthe origin of the large scatter in the star formation scaling law for the total cloud masses\nis a direct result of the large variations in the dense gas (high extinction) fractions that are\nobserved for these clouds (Paper I). In contrast to classical Schmidt-Kennicutt extragalactic\nscaling laws, there is no evidence for a super-linear scaling for the star formation law for\nlocal clouds, even when the total masses of the clouds are considered.\n\n2.2.\n\nGalaxies\n\nIn order to compare galaxies with the galactic clouds on the SFR-Molecular Mass diagram we use the sample of galaxies observed by Gao and Solomon (2004; hereafter GS04).\nTheir sample consists of normal spirals and starburst galaxies, including luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (i.e., LIRGs & ULIRGs). We selected this sample for comparison\nwith our local cloud sample because it is the only sample of galaxies with systematically\nmeasured molecular masses using both a tracer of high density gas, HCN, and a tracer of\ntotal cloud mass, CO. In addition, the SFRs of the galaxies in the sample are all derived in\nthe same manner from a homogeneous set of infrared observations.\nIt is a priori unclear whether the star formation rates and/or gas masses reported for\nthe GS04 galaxy sample are directly comparable to those reported in Paper I for the local\ncloud sample. The SFR for the local clouds was determined by direct counting of nearly\ncomplete inventories of Young Stellar Objects in each cloud and assuming a star formation\ntimescale of 2 Myrs, while the SFRs for the GS04 galaxies are galaxy-wide averages that\nwere derived from conversion of a FIR flux into a mass growth rate using stellar population\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsynthesis models and assuming, among other parameters, a simple Salpeter IMF and a\ntimescale of 10-100 Myrs (Kennicutt 1998b). Gao and Solomon use the most simple form of\nthe virial theorem to convert HCN luminosity to a galaxy averaged dense gas mass, while in\nPaper I masses are calculated from direct integration of resolved extinction measurements\nof individual clouds and the assumption of a standard gas-to-dust ratio. Moreover, even\nif both mass calculations are accurate, it is not obvious that the AK = 0.8 mag contour\nencompasses exactly the same mass as would be detected in HCN emission averaged over\nan entire cloud or galaxy. We therefore would not necessarily expect the Galactic clouds\nand the Gao-Solomon galaxies to fall onto the exact same line in the SFR-Molecular Mass\ndiagram (for dense gas masses) and, they do not. Although previous studies (GS04, Paper\nI) independently found the relation between SFR and dense gas mass to be linear for both\nlocal clouds and galaxies, the respective coefficients (intercepts) differed by a factor of 2.7,\nwith the galactic relation predicting higher SFRs for a given amount of dense gas. However,\ngiven the fact that these two linear relations together span nine orders of magnitude in mass,\nand their coefficients are consistent within the quoted errors (Paper I), it seems reasonable\nto conclude that they represent one and the same relation.\nIndeed, in a study of massive, but relatively distant, Galactic molecular clouds, Wu et\nal (2005) demonstrated a linear correlation between FIR and LHCN for those clouds that was\nnearly identical (with similar coefficients) to that found by Gao and Solomon (2004). This\nfinding thus extended the correlation between these two quantities over a range of more than\n7-8 orders of magnitude and indicated that both the GS04 galaxies and Galactic clouds should\nlie on the same SFR-Mass relation for the dense gas component traced by HCN observations.\nBecause the SFRs and masses calculated for the local sample are likely more robust than\nthose determined for the Wu et al. clouds and the GS04 galaxies, we decided to adjust the\ncoefficient of the GS04 relation to match that of the local sample for the dense molecular\ngas. In principle, this could be accomplished by either, a) adjusting the star formation\nrates upward, b) adjusting the HCN masses downward, or c) simultaneously adjusting some\nappropriate linear combination of both these quantities. It is not obvious which of these\nalternatives would be most appropriate, and given the complexities and uncertainties in\ncalculating both the star formation rates and dense gas masses for these galaxies, choice c)\nmight be the best option. However, for simplicity we elected to match the coefficients by\nadjusting the GS04 star formation rates upward (by log(\u2206SFR) = 0.43) so that they match\nthose of Paper I when linearly extrapolated down to local cloud masses. We emphasize here\nthat the primary results and conclusions of this paper (see \u00a73) are independent of the details\n(i.e., a, b or c) of how we choose to adjust the coefficient of the GS04 relation to match the\nrelation for local clouds.\nIn Figure 2 we extend the SFR-Molecular Mass plot to scales that can include mea-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsurements of entire galaxies and we plot the galaxies in the GS04 sample. As with the local\nsample we plot two sets of masses for the GS04 galaxies. Again, the filled symbols correspond to dense gas masses, as measured using HCN emission. The open symbols correspond\nto total cloud masses measured from CO emission. The dense gas masses of the galaxies are\nthose determined by GS04. Since GS04 did not report total gas (CO) masses for the galaxies\nin their sample, we made use of the CO(1-0) luminosities reported by GS04 to derive the\ntotal gas masses. We applied a conversion of Mgas /LCO = 1.36 \u00d7 \u03b1G with a Galactic value of\n\u03b1G = 3.2 M\u2299 (K km s\u22121 pc2 )\u22121 (e.g., Genzel et al. 2010). The star formation rates for these\ngalaxies are those determined by GS04 after the upward adjustment described described\nabove.\nAdjusting the GS04 SFRs upward implicitly assumes that the SFRs determined from\nLFIR underestimate the true star formation rates, at least when extrapolated to local clouds.\nIn an attempt to assess this possibility we investigated the relation between LFIR and SFR\nin the local cloud sample. In the local cloud sample of Paper I, the SFR is dominated by\nthe Orion A and B molecular clouds which account for 67% of the total SFR for all the\nclouds in the sample. Following the prescription of GS04 we used IRAS observations to\ndetermine the FIR luminosity of a 100 pc diameter region encompassing both the Orion A\nand B clouds. We calculated the FIR luminosity to be 5.4 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 . Using the relation\n\u1e40SFR \u2248 2\u00d710\u221210 (LIR /L\u2299 ) M\u2299 yr \u22121, (following GS04 and Kennicutt 1998b), this corresponds\nto SFR = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a value which is a factor of 8 lower than the combined SFR\n(8.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) determined for the Orion A and B clouds in Paper I. We note that\nmuch of this deficit is likely due to the fact that the extragalactic FIR prescription for SFRs\nis appropriate for star formation timescales of 10-100 Myrs and a well sampled IMF at high\nstellar masses while the SFRs for the local cloud sample are derived for a 2 Myr timescale\nand for a young stellar population that does not as completely sample the high mass end of\nthe IMF. Nonetheless, these considerations suggest that at least some upward adjustment of\nthe GS04 SFRs may be necessary for comparison with local clouds.\nAnother consequence of the upward adjustment of the star formation rates is that of\na corresponding decrease in the estimated total molecular gas depletion times for the GS04\ngalaxies. This decrease would amount to a factor of 2.7 for the adjustment factor we adopted\nand have potentially important consequences for our understanding of galaxy evolution.\nThese decreased gas depletion times for the GS04 galaxies are consistent those that describe the local galactic clouds (e.g., Figure 1). However, we hesitate in drawing too firm\na conclusion regarding this particular issue since it does depend somewhat on our choice\nof adjustment options (i.,e., a, b, or c). For example, if we selected option (b) above, only\nthe depletion time for the dense gas component of the galaxies would be lowered. It is\nalso interesting to note in this context that the depletion times for the dense star-forming\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ngas are typically an order of magnitude lower than those estimated for the total molecular\ngas component in both galaxies and local clouds, and this remains true independent of any\nadjustments to the galaxy data.\nAs discussed earlier, instead of adjusting the star formation rates, we could have adjusted the GS04 galaxy masses (downward) by the same constant offset in log(M). By not\ncorrecting the mass estimates we are assuming that the molecular-line derived masses and\nthe extinction derived masses accurately reflect the same cloud material, that is, MDG =\nMHCN and MT G = MCO . To assess this possibility for the case of the total cloud masses,\nMT G , we compared the extinction measurements with CO observations of a subset of the\nlocal cloud sample. We obtained CO data for five of the clouds from the archive of the CfA\n1.2 m Millimeter-wave Telescope (Dame et al. 2001). The 12 CO observations were averaged\nover the individual clouds and the integrated CO intensities were measured for each cloud.\nApplying the standard CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 2 x 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 (Dame\net al. 2001) to convert the integrated intensities to H2 column densities, we determined the\nmass of each cloud. We found these CO derived masses to all agree with the corresponding\nextinction (AK \u2265 0.1 mag) derived masses to better than 12%, indicating that the extinction (AK > 0.1 mag) and CO derived total masses both trace the same cloud material for\nlocal clouds. This suggests that total masses derived from CO can be a good proxy for\nextinction derived total masses and thus that the masses derived from CO observations of\ngalaxies can be compared directly with those of the local cloud sample, provided that the\ngalaxy measurements trace the summed CO emission from a population of GMCs. If there\nis any diffuse CO emission from inert, non star-forming, molecular gas contributing to the\ngalaxy-averaged CO measurements, then the CO masses derived for galaxies overestimate\nthe masses in star forming GMCs. In such a case the CO derived masses for the galaxies\nwould have to be adjusted downwards to compare to the local observations.\nA similar comparison of extinction and HCN derived masses is not possible for the\nlocal clouds since the corresponding HCN observations of these clouds do not exist. This is\nunfortunate because the HCN masses derived by GS04 are likely upper limits to the true\nmasses (Gao and Solomon 2004b). For example, if the clouds are bound but not virialized\nthen the derived masses could be somewhat underestimated. Thus, although it appears that\nthe extragalactic CO derived masses can be directly placed on the SFR-Molecular Cloud\nMass diagram without any systematic adjustment, the situation is somewhat less certain for\nthe HCN masses derived by GS04. However, we note that the average ratio of dense gas (i.e.,\nAV \u2265 0.8 mag) to total cloud mass (i.e., AV \u2265 0.1 mag.) calculated from the extinction data\nis < fDG > = 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 for the sample of local clouds. For the GS04 sample of galaxies\nwe find < fDG > = 0.16 \u00b1 0.14 comparing the HCN and CO derived masses. The relatively\nclose correspondence of fDG for these two samples is consistent with the idea that the high\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nextinction and HCN observations trace roughly similar fractions of the total cloud masses\nand thus similar dense material in clouds and galaxies, (i.e., MDG = MHCN ). This suggests\nthat the extragalactic HCN and CO observations of Gao and Solomon likely trace similar\nmaterial as observed in the extinction observations of Galactic clouds by Lada et al.(2010)\nand thus both sets of masses can be directly placed on the SFR-Molecular Mass diagram\nwithout systematic adjustment.\nWe note here that instead of plotting galaxies on the SFR\u2013Molecular Mass diagram many\nauthors traditionally prefer to plot them on the \u03a3SFR \u2013 \u03a3gas diagram, arguing that these two\nlatter quantities are not affected by the (correlated) errors induced by inaccuracies in the\ngalaxy distance measurements. However, we prefer to plot the total formation rate, SFR, as\nfunction of the gas mass, MG , to better compare the local sample with the extragalactic one.\nIn doing so, we acknowledge the fact that the distance-squared factor entering the evaluation\nof the total mass and total star-formation rate could induce a potentially strong correlation\nbetween these two variables. This correlation, in turn, might hide the real power-law index\nof the underlying relation, making it appear closer to unity than it is in reality (this is\na consequence of the fact that the distance enters with the same exponent, two, in both\nquantities). On the other hand, simple statistical arguments and numerical checks show\nthat the measured slope of the relation is significantly biased only in the limit where the\nrelative error on the square of the distance is of the same order of magnitude, or larger, than\nthe range spanned by the data. In our case, the extragalactic data set spans approximately\n4 orders of magnitude, and distances errors are on the order of 30% or less, and therefore we\nare affected by a negligible bias in the measurement of the slope of the underlying relation\nusing the SFR-Molecular Mass diagram.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThe SFR-Molecular Mass diagram of Figure 2 provides a physical context for understanding the star formation scaling laws over spatial scales ranging from those of local molecular clouds to those of entire galaxies. The close correlation of the star formation rate with\nthe mass of dense gas over these immense scales has been established in previous studies (Wu\net al. 2005, Paper I). Here we find that a close relation also appears to hold between the SFR\nand the total molecular mass over a similarly large range, 8-9 orders of magnitude in both\nquantities. Both the local clouds and galaxies appear to scatter around the linear relation\ngiven by Equation 1 for fDG = 0.1 and MG = MT G . From extrapolation of the results for\nlocal clouds we suggest that this particular line corresponds to the case where 10% of the\nmeasured gas mass is in the form of dense, star forming material for the galaxies as well\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nas for the local clouds. The smaller scatter of the galaxies around this relation compared\nto that of the local clouds is likely the result of the fact that the galaxy measurements are\naverages over entire systems.\nThese results indicate that, similar to the situation for dense gas, the star formation\nscaling law for total (H2 + He) gas mass is likely linear across all scales for molecular clouds\nwith similar dense gas fractions. This notion is reinforced by the recent observations of Daddi\net al. (2010) who studied infrared-selected BzK galaxies at z \u223c 1.5 and found evidence for\nunusually high gas fractions and extended molecular reservoirs in these distant systems.\nUsing the star formation rates and CO gas masses provided by Daddi et al. (2010), we plot\nthese six galaxies (open triangles) on Figure 2 and find that the BzK galaxies occupy an area\nin the SFR-Molecular Mass plot that is close to the linear relation described by Equation\n1, consistent with the locations of Gao and Solomon galaxies and the extrapolation of the\nlocal Galactic cloud sample.\nThese results lead us to the conclusion that there is a basic and universal physical process\nof star formation that presently operates in our Milky Way galaxy and is also responsible\nfor the bulk of star forming activity occurring in external galaxies both in the present epoch\n(z \u2248 0; GS04) and perhaps at much earlier (z \u2248 1 \u2212 2; Daddi et al. 2010) cosmic times.\nIt is a process in which the rate of star formation is simply and directly controlled by the\namount of dense molecular gas that can be assembled within a star forming complex. In\nmost situations massive molecular clouds appear to be able to convert only about 10% or\nless of their total mass into a sufficiently dense (n(H2 ) \u2265 104 cm\u22123 ) form to actively produce\nstars. This may be considered as the normal process of star formation in GMCs.\nCloser inspection of Figure 2 suggests that for starburst galaxies, particularly the\nULIRGS, this standard scenario may be modified. As the SFRs for starbursts (i.e., LIRGs\nand ULIRGs in Figure 2) increase with gas mass, the open symbols (CO derived gas masses)\nappear to approach and then merge with the filled symbols (HCN derived gas masses), almost\noverlapping at the highest SFRs. As originally hypothesized by Gao and Solomon (2004),\nwe interpret this to indicate that these galaxies are characterized by an increasingly high\ndense gas fraction and consequently, the CO observations begin to trace nearly the same\nmaterial as the HCN observations. Nonetheless, the star formation rate is still dictated by\nthe amount of dense gas within the galaxies. This interpretation is also favored by Heiderman et al. (2010) who suggested that the maximal starburst activity occurs when fDG = 1\nwhich they posit to happen when the mass surface density exceeds values \u223c 104 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nULIRGS (e.g., Arp 200) are believed to be experiencing major mergers and we suggest that\nthis extreme process likely produces conditions (e.g., high pressures) that could increase the\ndense gas fractions of the molecular clouds within these systems (e.g., Blitz & Rosolowsky\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n2006). In contrast the BzK galaxies studied by Daddi et al. (2010) have similarly high SFRs\nbut lower dense gas fractions. Their high star formation rates appear to result from high\nglobal molecular gas mass fractions (i.e., MH2 /M\u2217 ), as might be expected for very young\ngalaxies.\nWe note that a linear relation in the SFR-Mass plane should transform to a linear\nrelation in the \u03a3SF R -\u03a3g plane (provided the surface densities for the galaxies are global\naverages) and we can express our star formation scaling law in this latter plane as:\n\u03a3SF R \u221d fDG \u03a3g\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a3g refers to the H2 gas mass. Moreover, the Spitzer study of Galactic clouds by\nHeiderman et al. (2010) suggested a linear star formation law in the \u03a3SF R -\u03a3g plane that\nholds for gas above a threshold surface density of \u223c 130 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (i.e., AK > 0.9 mag) and\nextrapolates smoothly to the GS04 galaxies.\nOur result is apparently not consistent with the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt, superlinear, scaling law (Kennicutt 1998a). Both are based on valid empirical relations. However,\nhere we argue that the underlying scaling law for star formation is linear over all scales\nfor all clouds and galaxies, provided they are characterized by the same dense gas fraction.\nKennicutt (1998a) uses total (HI + H2 ) gas mass surface densities with CO derived molecular\nmasses and combines results for both normal star-forming disk galaxies and starburst galaxies\nto derive his star formation scaling law. Note that for these latter galaxies the total gas\nsurface densities are dominated by the molecular component. The starbursts dominate his\nrelation for \u03a3gas > 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . It is possible that the fit of a single relation to the combined\nsample with CO determined masses is inappropriate and skewed by the starbursts because\nfDG for starbursts is higher than that for normal star forming spirals. Indeed, Gao and\nSolomon (2004) showed that using the masses calculated from the CO observations produced\na super-linear (n \u2248 1.7) scaling law (in the SFR vs MG plane) for a sample that included\ntheir galaxies and an additional number of luminous starbursts drawn form the literature.\nUsing gas masses derived solely from HCN observations, however, produces a linear star\nformation law connecting both normal star forming galaxies and starbursts. The standard\nSchmidt-Kennicutt relation may also be skewed at low mass surface densities. For galaxies in\nthis portion of the diagram, the HI surface density is a large fraction of the total gas surface\ndensity and thus the measured total gas surface density, \u03a3HI+H2 , contains a large component\nof inert, non-star forming, (HI) gas; this dilutes and lowers the SFR corresponding to a fixed\nmass surface density, resulting in a steepening of the slope of the \u03a3SF R vs \u03a3gas relation.\nThese two effects, the increasing dense gas fraction for the starbursts and the dilution of\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe dense gas fraction by HI gas at low gas surface densities, which act together to steepen\nthe slope of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, can also explain the finding of Heiderman et al.\n(2010) and Evans et al. (2009) that the extrapolation of the extragalactic scaling relations\nto local scales (i.e., low mass surface densities) lies below the data for Galactic clouds.\nIt can also be shown that our scaling law (Equation 1) is consistent with a volumetric\nscaling law, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 \u221d \u03c1nG if and only if n = 1 and \u03c1G \u2265 \u03c1thres , where \u03c1thres /\u03bc corresponds to the\nthreshold volumetric number density for star formation for a mean particle mass given by \u03bc\n(i.e., n(H2 ) \u2265 104 cm\u22123 ).\nAs discussed earlier, taking the empirical, linear star-forming scaling relations at face\nvalue leads to a simple interpretation of the observations in Figures 1 & 2. Namely, that the\ntotal rate of star formation, \u1e40\u2217 , is directly proportional to the mass of dense molecular gas\nR\u221e\nabove a threshold density, MDG = \u03c1thres M(\u03c1)d\u03c1. Moreover, once the gas has reached this\nthreshold density, the SFR does not depend on the exact value of the density but only on\nthe total mass of gas whose density has exceeded the threshold. This interpretation of the\nobservations differs from those that explain the observed non-linear index of the SchmidtKennicutt law as resulting from star formation timescales dictated by the free-fall time,\ne.g., SFR \u223c M/\u03c4f f \u223c \u03c1/\u03c1\u22120.5 \u223c \u03c11.5 since \u03c4f f \u223c \u03c1\u22120.5 (e.g., Elmegreen 1994; Krumholz &\nThompson 2007; Narayanan et al. 2008). A recent variant of such a model has been studied\nby Krumholz et al. (2011). They propose that the underlying physical law governing the\nrelation between star formation rates and cloud properties is given by \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 \u221d \u03c1G /\u03c4f f . They\nfind that the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt law can be linearized if the data are plotted in the\n\u03a3SF R \u2212 \u03a3G /\u03c4f f plane as long as the free-fall times are measured using the typically higher\ndensities of the star forming gas rather than those derived from the mean densities averaged\nover kpc scales. Their interpretation differs from the one in this paper in that Krumholz et al.\n(2011) posit that the positions of galaxies in the standard \u03a3SF R -\u03a3G plane are a consequence\nof both their gas surface densities and their local free-fall times, while here we posit that the\nlocations of these galaxies instead depend on their gas surface densities and their dense gas\nfractions. Although both interpretations are consistent with the observations, they appear\nnot to be consistent with each other. However, we point out that Figure 1 empirically\ndemonstrates that the locations of Galactic clouds in the SFR-Mass diagram are in fact a\nresult of their dense gas fractions. Therefore it seems reasonable to infer that the locations\nof galaxies in the diagram are due to the same cause.\nFinally, we reiterate our point that the linear scaling law of Equation 1 implies that the\nprocess of star formation across entire galaxies as well as individual local clouds is governed\nby a very similar and simple physical principle: the rate at which molecular gas is turned\ninto stars depends on the mass of dense gas within a molecular cloud or cloud population.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe underlying star formation scaling law is linear over all scales for all clouds and galaxies\ncharacterized by the same dense gas fraction. The star formation rate appears therefore to\nbe controlled by local processes and not by global, galactic scale mechanisms, except to the\nextent that such mechanisms can alter the dense gas fractions in the molecular gas. If this\ninterpretation is correct, then the key problem that needs to be addressed in future studies\nis that of the origin of the dense gas component of molecular clouds.\nWe thank Leo Blitz, Tom Dame, Daniela Calzetti, Bruce Elmegreen, Debbie Elmegreen,\nNeal Evans, Reinhard Genzel, and Mark Krumholz for informative discussions and comments\nand Tom Dame for providing us with CO data.\n\nREFERENCES\nBigiel, F., Leroy, A., Walter, F., et al. 2008, AJ, 136, 2846\nBlitz, L., & Rosolowsky, E. 2006, ApJ, 650, 933\nDaddi, E., Bournaud, F., Walter, F., et al. 2010, ApJ, 713, 686\nDame, T.
