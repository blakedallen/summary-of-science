Mass loss is a determinant factor which strongly affects the evolution and the fate of\nmassive stars. At low metallicity, stars are supposed to rotate faster than at the solar one. This\nfavors the existence of stars near the critical velocity. In this rotation regime, the deformation of\nthe stellar surface becomes important, and wind anisotropy develops. Polar winds are expected\nto be dominant for fast rotating hot stars.\nThese polar winds allow the star to lose large quantities of mass and still retain a high\nangular momentum, and they modifie the evolution of the surface velocity and the final angular\nmomentum kept in the star's core. We show here how these winds affect the final stages of\nmassive stars, according to our knowledge about Gamma Ray Bursts. Computation of theoretical\nGamma Ray Bursts rate indicates that our models have too fast rotating cores, and that we need\nto include an additional effect to spin them down. Magnetic fields in stars act in this direction,\nand we show how they modify the evolution of massive star up to the final stages.\nKeywords. stars: evolution, stars: magnetic fields, stars: mass loss, gamma rays: bursts\n\n1. Effects of rotation on the stellar surface\nRotation has a strong influence on the stellar surface. Indeed, it adds a centrifugal\ncomponent to the gravity, which modifies the shape of the surface, and various quantities\nsuch as the effective temperature Teff and the mass loss flux. These effects can be derived\nfrom the von Zeipel theorem (von Zeipel 1924), which is originally valid for conservative\ncases of angular momentum distribution, and was treated in the more general case of the\nso-called \"shellular rotation\" by Maeder (1999). This theorem gives the relation between\nthe local flux F of the star and the local effective gravity:\nF=\u2212\n\nL(P )\ngeff (1 + \u03b6(\u03b8))\n4\u03c0GM\u22c6 (P )\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere L(P ) is the luminosity on the isobar and geff the local effective gravity. The two\nremaining terms are given by\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0015\n\u03c7T \u0011\nHT d\u0398\n\u03b6(\u03b8) = 1 \u2212\n\u0398+\nP2 (cos(\u03b8))\n(1.2)\n\u03b4\n\u03b4 dr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a92\n(1.3)\nM\u22c6 = M 1 \u2212\n2\u03c0G\u03c1m\nHere, \u03c1m is the internal average density, M\u22c6 represents the effective mass, modified by\nthe rotation velocity \u03a9, \u03c7 = 4acT 3/(3\u03ba\u03c1) is the thermal conductivity coefficient and \u03c7T\nis its partial derivative with respect to T , \u0398 = \u03c1\u0303\u03c1 is the ratio of the horizontal density\nfluctuation to the average density on the isobar (Zahn 1992). \u03b4 is the thermodynamic\ncoefficient \u03b4 = \u2212 (\u2202 ln \u03c1/\u2202 ln T )P, \u03bc and HT is the temperature scale height. Generally\nthe term \u03b6(\u03b8) is very small, and we can neglect it.\nThe total gravity at the surface of the star is given by gtot = geff + grad with grad = \u03baF\nc\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCyril Georgy, Georges Meynet & Andr\u00e9 Maeder\n\nis the term due to radiative forces and \u03ba the total Rossland mean opacity. The Eddington\nlimit in a rotating star is defined by the vanishing of gtot and we find the limiting flux\nc\nFlim = \u2212 geff .\n(1.4)\n\u03ba\nThe Eddington factor at a given colatitude, which is given by the ratio of the local flux\nto the limiting flux, becomes (Maeder 1999)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a92\n4\u03c0cGM\nL(P )\n1\u2212\n.\n(1.5)\nwith Lmax =\n\u0393\u03a9 (\u03b8) =\nLmax\n\u03ba(\u03b8) (1 + \u03b6(\u03b8))\n2\u03c0G\u03c1m\nA first interesting consequence is that the maximum luminosity of a star, given by\n\u0393\u03a9 (\u03b8) = 1, is lowered by rotation (compare Lmax given above with the non-rotating\none Lmax, no rot = 4\u03c0cGM\n).\n\u03ba\nRotation has also a strong impact on the mass loss rate of the star. Maeder and Meynet\n(2000) found the following relation between the mass loss rate at a given rotational\nvelocity \u1e40 (\u03a9) and the non-rotating one:\n1\n\n(1 \u2212 \u0393) \u03b1 \u22121\n\u1e40 (\u03a9)\n= h\ni \u03b11 \u22121\n\u1e40 (0)\n\u03a92\n1 \u2212 2\u03c0G\u03c1\n\u2212\n\u0393\nm\n\n(1.6)\n\n\u03baL\nwhere \u0393 = 4\u03c0cGM\nis the \"non-rotating\" Eddington factor. We see that rotation will\nincrease the total mass loss rate of the star.\nRotation has another effect on the mass loss rate: it is no long isotropic at the surface\nof a rotating star, but becomes colatitude-dependent. Maeder and Meynet (2000) give\nthe following local mass loss rate \u2206\u1e40 per unit surface \u2206\u03c3:\n\u0012\n\u0013 1\u2212\u03b1 \u0014\n\u0015 \u03b11\n1\n1\u2212\u03b1 \u03b1\nL(P )\ngeff\n\u2206\u1e40\n\u03b1\n(1.7)\n\u2243 (k\u03b1)\n1\n\u22121\n\u2206\u03c3\n\u03b1\n4\u03c0GM\u22c6 (P )\n(1 \u2212 \u0393\u03a9 (\u03b8)) \u03b1\n\nwith \u03ba and \u03b1 the force multiplier parameters. We neglect here the small effect of \u03b6(\u03b8).\nRotation favors mass loss through the terms M\u22c6 and \u0393\u03a9 . Mass loss occurs preferentially\nwhere geff is small, i.e at the poles. Then mass loss rate is thus varying as a function of\nthe colatitude, producing the anisotropic wind phenomenon.\nFigure 1 shows various effects of the rotation at the surface of a 20 M\u2299 star at a\nmetallicity of 10\u22125 and at 95% of the critical rotation velocity. We can first remark that\nReq\n\u2243 1.3. Then we\nthe star becomes oblate, with an equatorial-to-polar radius ratio Rpol\nnote the variation of the effective temperature with respect to colatitude: Teff at the pole\nis around 48000 K, while it is only around 34000 K at the equator. Finally, we see that\nthe mass loss flux is larger at the pole by a factor of \u223c 3.8. This allows the star to lose\n10% less angular momentum than if the same amount of mass was lost isotropically.\n\n2. Models without magnetic field and rate of GRB\nLet us briefly recall here the main assumptions of the so-called \"collapsar\" model for\nlong-soft Gamma Ray Bursts (Woosley 1993). In order to produce such an event, the\nfollowing conditions must be fulfilled:\n\u2022 formation of a black hole;\n\u2022 enough angular momentum in the stellar core in order to form an accretion disk\naround the BH;\n\u2022 formation of a type Ic supernova (see Woosley and Bloom (2006)).\n\n\f3\n\nWind anisotropy and stellar evolution\n\ncm\n2e-8 g/s/ cm\n1e-8 g/s/\n\n6\n\n2\n2\n\n48200 K\n\n5\n4\n\n43500 K\n3\n2\n\n38700 K\n\n1\n34000 K\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u03a9\nFigure 1. Effects of rotation on a 20 M\u2299 star at Z = 10\u22125 and with \u03a9crit\n= 0.95. The star is\nseen equator-on, and the axis are in R\u2299 . The latitudinal variation of Teff is shown (gray scale),\nand the arrows represents the masse flux at a given colatitude.\n\nThese three points agree with a fast rotating massive star. It is thus interesting to\nstudy the evolution of the rate of type Ic supernovae. Figure 2 shows the relative rates\nfor type Ib and type Ic SNe, computed with rotating models without magnetic field.\nTo distinguish between type Ib and type Ic, we use a criterion based on the amount of\nHe ejected during the SN event: all models ejecting more than 0.55 M\u2299 of helium and\nno hydrogen are considered as type Ib, the models ejecting less than 0.55 M\u2299 of helium\n(and still no hydrogen) are considered to give birth to a type Ic SN event. The interesting\ncurve for our purpose is the dashed one, representing the SN Ic / SN II ratio with respect\nto the metallicity. Wee see that the number fraction of type Ic supernova becomes higher\nat higher metallicity. This is well in agreement with the trend shown by the observed\ntype Ic to type II SNe ratios given by Prieto et al. (2008). There are many observed\nevidences indicating that long-soft GRB occurs preferentially in metal-poor regions. For\ninstance, Modjaz et al. (2008) find that GRB events appear at low metallicity: between\n0.2 < Z/Z\u2299 < 0.7. Thus only type Ic events in metal poor regions (or part of them) can\noccur simultaneously with a GRB event.\nMoreover, if we consider our models at metallicities that are compatible with the\nobserved GRB range of metallicity, we see that all the models producing a type Ic SN\nkeep enough angular momentum in the core to fulfilled the collapsar model conditions (see\nHirschi et al. (2005)). We can thus determine the ratio of GRB event to the total number\nof core collapse SNe; we found that this rate is around 15% for metallicities between 0.4\nand 0.7 Z\u2299. In comparison, Podsiadlowski et al. (2004) found an observational rate of\n0.04% \u2212 8%, depending of the aperture angle of the bipolar jets produced during the\nGRB event. Our theoretical rate is therefore much larger than the observational one.\nThese two facts lead to the conclusion that not all type Ic SNe produce a GRB. We\nhave thus to find a way to reduce the number of GRB progenitor candidates, in order to\nreproduce the observational rate. One possibility is to introduce new ingredients in our\nmodels to extract more angular momentum from the core during the stellar life.\n\n3. Models with magnetic field and wind anisotropy\nFollowing Spruit (2002), we have included in our models the effect of magnetic field\namplified at the expense of the excess energy in the shear. As noted just above, this\nproduces a strong coupling between the differentially rotating layers, and tend to build\n\n\f4\n\nCyril Georgy, Georges Meynet & Andr\u00e9 Maeder\n\nFigure 2. SNIb/SNII (solid line), SNIb/SNII (dotted line) and SNIc/SNII (dashed line) ratios.\nThe triangles are observed SNIb/SNII ratio at various metallicities and the upside down gray\ntriangles observed SNIc/SNII ratio (extracted from Prieto et al. (2008)).\n\na solid\u2013body rotation profile. Contrarily to the previous models, where the rotational\nvelocity is only weakly coupled between the surface and the core, models with magnetic\nfield have a strong coupling, and thus, the loss of angular momentum due to mass loss is\nquickly transmitted to the core. This implies a strong extraction of angular momentum\nduring the evolution, particularly when the mass loss is strong at the surface (e.g. during\nthe Wolf\u2013Rayet phases).\nTo explore the combined effects of magnetic field and wind anisotropy, we computed\ntwo 60 M\u2299 models at Z = 0.002 with \u03a9/\u03a9crit = 0.75, with and without the treatment of\nthe wind anisotropy. With respect to the work by Meynet and Maeder (2007), we have\nimproved significantly the treatment of the wind anisotropy, allowing this treatment to\napply even when the critical velocity is reached and checking very carefully that the\nsum of the angular momentum remaining in the star and the angular momentum lost\nin the wind remains constant all over the evolution (see Fig. 3, bottom panel). As we\nshall see below, this improvements lead to effects which although still important are less\npronounced as in Meynet and Maeder (2007).\nFor both models, the strong mixing induced by the magnetic field leads to the so-called\n\"quasi-chemically-homogenous\" evolution (see Yoon and Langer (2005) and Woosley and Heger\n(2006)). Figure 3 (top panel) shows the evolution of the total angular momentum of the\nstellar interior during its evolution. We see that the anisotropic model (dashed curve)\nis slightly higher than the isotropic one (solid curve). This is due to the effect of wind\nanisotropy, as shown in the medium panel: the anisotropic model lose less angular momentum (around 7%), while the rotational velocity is high (first part of the evolution).\nThen, the star becomes a WR, and the high mass loss rate implies a strong breaking of\nthe rotation: the surface velocity is sufficiently below the critical velocity for removing\nany anisotropy in the wind, and there is no more differences between these two models.\nWe see that when magnetic field is accounted for, the WR phase has a crucial influence\non the total angular momentum kept in the star (and thus in the core, through the\ncoupling produced by the magnetic field). Our model does not keep enough angular\nmomentum for the collapsar model, and is thus not a good GRB progenitor candidate.\n\n\fWind anisotropy and stellar evolution\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Top panel: evolution of the total angular momentum kept in the star (in units of\n[1045 g cm2 s\u22121 ]). The dased curve is the model with anisotropic wind, the solid curve for the\nisotropic one. Middle panel: angular momentum removed by wind at each time step, in the\nsame units: dased curve for anisotropic model, solid for isotropic one. Bottom panel: Sum of the\nangular momentum of the star and the integrated angular momentum removed by wind.\n\nHowever, models with very high initial rotational velocity would most probably develop\nlarger differences between the iso\u2013 and anisotropic treatment. The same would be true\nfor models with lower mass loss rate (less massive models, lower metallicity). We will\nadress this point in a forthcoming paper.\nReferences\nHirschi, R., Meynet, G., and Maeder, A. 2005, A&A 443, 581\nMaeder, A. 1999, A&A 347, 185\nMaeder, A. and Meynet, G. 2000, A&A 361, 159\nMeynet, G. and Maeder, A. 2007, A&A 464, L11\nModjaz, M., Kewley, L., Kirshner, R.
