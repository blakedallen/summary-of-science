In one dimension the Hubbard physics is\ncharacterized by charge and spin separation, which implies that the density\nresponse is spinless fermion like, i.e., showing vanishing excitation energy at\n4kF . Exact diagonalization studies[1, 2] for the t-J model have revealed that the\ndynamical density response N (q, \u03c9) for the 2D model relevant for the cuprates\nis very different from the 1D case. On the other hand these calculations show\nseveral features also unexpected from the point of view of weakly correlated\nfermion systems: (i) a strong suppression of low energy 2kF scattering in the\ndensity response, (ii) a broad incoherent peak whose shape is rather insensitve\nto hole concentration and exchange interaction J, (iii) a very different form of\nN (q, \u03c9) compared to the spin response function S(q, \u03c9), which share common\n1 publ. in \"Open Problems in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems\", J. Bon\u010da et al. (eds.), KluwerAcademic, Boston, 2001, p. 81-90.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nfeatures in usual fermionic systems. Finite temperature diagonalization studies\n[3] show only weak temperature dependence for T < 0.3t even at low energy.\nWhile considerable analytical work has been done to explain the spin response of the t-J model only few authors analysed N (q, \u03c9). Wang et al.[4]\nstudied collective excitations in the density channel and found sharp peaks at\nlarge momenta corresponding to free bosons. Similar results were obtained by\nGehlhoff and Zeyher[5] using the X-operator formalism. Lee et al[6] considered a model of bosons in a fluctuating gauge field and found a broad incoherent\ndensity fluctuation spectrum at finite temperature, due to the coupling of bosons\nto a quasistatic disordered gauge field.\nStarting from a slave-boson representation we show that the essential features\nobserved in the numerical studies can be obtained in the framework of the\nFermi-liquid phase of the t-J model at zero temperature[7]. Our main findings\nare: (i) at low momenta the main effect of strong correlations is to transfer\nspectral weight from particle-hole excitations into a pronounced collective\nmode. Because of the strong damping of this mode (linear in q) due to the\ncoupling to the spinon particle-hole continuum, this collective excitation is\nqualitatively different from a sound mode. (ii) At large momenta we find a\nstrict similarity of N (q, \u03c9) with the spectral function of a single hole moving\nin a uniform RVB spinon background. In this regime N (q, \u03c9) consists of a\nbroad peak at high energy whose origin is the fast, incoherent motion of bare\nholes. (iii) The polaronic nature of dressed holes leads to the formation of a\nsecond peak at lower energy, which is more pronounced in (\u03c0, 0) direction in\nagreement with diagonalization studies[1, 2].\nThe anomalous renormalization of certain phonon modes as observed in\ninelastic neutron scattering provides a sensitive test of the pecularities of the\nlow-energy density response. In this contribution we shall analyse the strong,\ndoping-dependent renormalization of the highest breathing phonon modes\nwhich is a generic feature in the high-Tc compounds.\n\n2.\n\nSLAVE BOSON THEORY OF DENSITY RESPONSE\n\nFollowing Kotliar and Liu[8] and Wang et al [4] we start from the N component generalization of the slave-boson t-J Hamiltonian, HtJ = Ht +HJ ,\nwhich is obtained by replacing the constrained electron creation operators\n+\n+\nc\u0303+\ni,\u03c3 = ci,\u03c3 (1 \u2212 ni,\u2212\u03c3 ) \u2192 fi,\u03c3 bi :\nHt = \u2212\n\nHJ =\n\nJ\nN\n\nX\n\n2t X\n(f + h+ hi fj\u03c3 + h.c.),\nN <i,j>\u03c3 i\u03c3 j\n\n<i,j>\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\nfi\u03c3\nfi\u03c3\u2032 fj\u03c3\n\u2032 fj\u03c3 (1 \u2212 hi hi )(1 \u2212 hj hj ),\n\n(1.1)\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fDensity Response of Cuprates andRenormalization of Breathing Phonons\n(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\nJ=0.05\n0.5\n\n0.0\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n0.0\n(\u03c0,\u03c0/2)\n\nN(q,\u03c9)\n\nN(q,\u03c9)\n\n0.4\n\n3\n\n0.4\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n(\u03c0,0)\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n(\u03c0/2,0)\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.0\n\n4.0\n\n4.0\n\n\u03c9/t\n\n8.0\n\n8.0\n\n\u03c9/t\nFigure 1.1 Comparison of N (q, \u03c9) obtained by the slave-boson theory (solid lines) with\ndiagonalization data for a periodic 4 \u00d7 4 cluster with J/t = 0.4 and doping \u03b4 = 0.25. The\ndashed line in the (\u03c0, \u03c0) spectrum indicates the \u03b4-function collective peak obtained when polaron\neffects are neglected. Right figure shows the weak J-dependence for the (\u03c0, \u03c0) spectrum.\n+\nwhere fi,\u03c3\nis a fermionic (spinon) operator, \u03c3 = 1, * * * , N is the fermionic\nflavor index, and hi denotes the bosonic holes. These operators obey standard\ncommutation\nrules, yet the number of these auxiliary particles must obey the\nP +\nfi\u03c3 + h+\nconstraint \u03c3 fi\u03c3\ni hi = N/2. The original t-J model is recovered for\nN = 2.\nThe slave boson parametrization provides a straightforward description of\nthe strong suppression of density fluctuations of constrained electrons through\nthe representation of the density response in terms of a dilute gas of bosons.\nA common treatment of model (1) is the density-phase representation (\"radial\" gauge[9]) of the bosonic operator hi = ri exp(i\u03b8i ) with the subsequent\n1/N -expansion around the Fermi-liquid saddle point. While this gauge is particularly useful to study the low energy and momentum properties, it is not\nvery convenient for the study of the density response in the full \u03c9 and q space.\nFormally the latter follows in the radial gauge from the fluctuations of ri2 .\nIf one considers for example convolution type bubble diagrams, one realizes\nthat their contribution to the static structure factor is correctly of order 1/N ,\n\n\f4\nbut is not proportional to the density of holes \u03b4 as it should be. According\nto Arrigoni et al[10] such unphysical results originate from a large negative\npole contribution in the hr\u2212q rq i\u03c9 Green's function of the real field r, which\nis hard to control by a perturbative treatment of phase fluctuations. We follow\ntherefore Popov[11] using the density-phase treatment only for small momenta\nq < q0 , while keeping the original particle-hole representation of the density\noperator,\nb+ b, at large momenta. More precisely hi = ri exp(i\u03b8i ) + bi , where\nP\nbi = |q|>q0 hq exp(iqRi ). The cutoff q0 is introduced dividing \"slow\" (collective) variables represented by r and \u03b8 from \"fast\" (single-particle) degrees\nof freedom. As explained by Popov[11] this \"mixed\" gauge is particularly\nuseful for finite temperature studies to control infrared divergences. We start\nformally with \"mixed\" gauge and keep only terms of order \u03b4 and 1/N in the\nbosonic self energies. In this approximation our zero temperature calculations\nbecome quite straightforward: The cutoff q0 < \u03b4 actually does not enter in the\nresults and we arrive finally at the Bogoliubov theory for a dilute gas of bosons\nmoving in a fluctuating spinon background.\n\nFigure 1.2 Density fluctuation spectra N (q, \u03c9) for J/t = 0.4 and \u03b4 = 0.15 along (\u03c0, 0) (top)\nand (\u03c0, \u03c0) directions (bottom).

The uniform mean field solution ri = r0 N/2 leads in the large\nN limit to the renormalized narrow fermionic spectrum\n\u03bek = \u2212z t\u0303\u03b3k \u2212 \u03bcf ,\nP\n+\nwith t\u0303 = J\u03c7 + t\u03b4, \u03b3k = 12 (cos kx + cos ky ), \u03c7 = \u03c3 hfi\u03c3\nfj\u03c3 i/N , and z = 4\nthe number of nearest neighbors. In the N = \u221e limit \u03c7\u221e \u2243 2/\u03c0 2 is given\nby that of free fermions, while for the original t-J model its value should\nbe larger[12] due to Gutzwiller projection. In the following \u03c7 = 32 \u03c7\u221e will\nbe used. Distinct from the finite-temperature gauge-field theory of Nagaosa\nand Lee[13] the bond-order phase fluctuations acquire a characteristic energy\nscale in this approach[4], and the fermionic (\"spinon\") excitations can be\nidentified with Fermi-liquid quasiparticles. The mean field spectrum of bosons\nis \u03c9q = 2z\u03c7t(1 \u2212 \u03b3q ). Thus the effective mass of holes m0h \u221d 1/t is much\nsmaller than that of the spinons.\nDue to the diluteness of the bosonic subsystem, \u03b4 \u226a 1, the density correlation function \u03c7q,\u03c9 = h\u03b4nh \u03b4nh iq\u03c9 is mainly given by the condensate induced\n+\npart which is represented by the Green's function h(b+\nq + b\u2212q )(bq + b\u2212q )i\u03c9 for\nq > q0 , and 2hr\u2212q rq i\u03c9 for q < q0 , respectively:\n\u03c7q\u03c9 =\n\n\u0011\nN 2\u0010 +\nr0 h(bq + b\u2212q )(bq + b+\n)i\n+\n2hr\nr\ni\n\u2212q q q<q0 .\n\u2212q q>q0\n2\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe 1/N self-energy corrections to\u221a\nthese functions\n\u221a are calculated in a conventional way[9, 8] expanding ri = (r0 N +(\u03b4r)i )/ 2 and considering Gaussian\nfluctuations around the mean field solution. Neglecting all terms of order \u03b4/N\nand q02 /N , only one relevant 1/N contribution remains which corresponds to\nthe dressing of the slave-boson Green's function by spinon particle-hole excitations. Within this approximation and at zero temperature no divergences occur\nat low momenta, thus one can take the limit q0 \u2192 0.

The latter channel provides a repulsion between bosons, making\nS (1) (\u03c9 = 0) positive and therefore ensuring the stability of the uniform meanfield solution. The 1/N self energies S (1/N ) and A(1/N ) are essentially a\nsingle boson property.

Although in the context of\n1/N theory the G0 function in (5) should be considered as a free propagator,\nwe shall use here the selfconsistent polaron picture for a single hole[14]. This\nis crucial when comparing the theory for N = 2 with diagonalization studies.\nFinally, the constants a and \u03bcb in (3) are given by (1 \u2212 tr02 /t\u0303) and S (1/N ) (\u03c9 =\nq = 0), respectively. The parameter r02 in Eq.1.8, which formally corresponds\nto the condensate\nfraction in our theory, is determined selfconsistently from\nP\nr02 = \u03b4 \u2212 q6=0 \u00f1q . The momentum distribution \u00f1q = hb+\nq bq i is calculated\nfrom the corresponding bosonic Green's function for finite hole-density.\nIn the small \u03c9, q limit N (q, \u03c9) (3) is mainly controlled by the interaction of\nbosons represented by the S (1) term (\u221d r02 ), while the internal polaron structure\nof the boson determined by S (1/N ) is less important. N (q, \u03c9) consists of a weak\nspinon particle-hole continuum with cutoff \u221d vF q, and a very pronounced linear\ncollective mode which nearly exhausts the sum rule. The velocity of this mode\nis always somewhat smaller than the spinon Fermi velocity, vs \u2264 vF \u2243 z t\u0303,\nwhich implies a strong damping \u221d \u03c9 (or q) of this mode (Fig.1.2).\nThe density response N (q, \u03c9) at large momenta, q > \u03b4, which we can\ncompare with diagonalization results, is dominated by the properties of a single\nboson selfenergy S (1/N ) . The calculated density response of the t-J model has\nthree characteristic features on different energy scales: (i) The main spectral\nweight of the excitations at large momenta is located in an energy region of\n\n\fDensity Response of Cuprates andRenormalization of Breathing Phonons\n\n7\n\norder of several t. This high energy peak is very broad and incoherent as a result\nof the strong coupling of bosons to low-energy spin excitations. The position of\nthis peak and its shape are rather insensitive to the ratio J/t \u2264 1 in agreement\nwith conclusions of [1, 2]. This is simply due to the fact that the high-energy\nproperties of the t-J model are controlled by t. (ii) The theory predicts also\na second peak at lower energy (Fig. 1.2) which is more pronounced in the\ndirection (\u03c0, 0), while its weight is strongly suppressed for q near (\u03c0, \u03c0). The\norigin of this excitation is due to the formation of a polaron-like band of dressed\nbosons. The relative weight of this contribution increases with J as a result of\nthe increasing spinon bandwidth. (iii) In addition there is the spinon particlehole continuum which is generated by S (1) with relatively small weight (\u221d \u03b42 ).\nAt (\u03c0, 0) the high energy cutoff of the spinon continuum is at z(\u03c7J + \u03b4t)\n(Fig. 1.2), while the polaron peak is at about (\u03c7J + \u03b4t).\nWe note that the polaron peak in N (q, \u03c9) is in the same energy range as the\nhigh energy phonons in cuprates.\n\n3.\n\nRENORMALIZATION OF BREATHING PHONONS\n\nInelastic neutron scattering experiments on high-Tc superconductors have\nshown that in particular the highest energy longitudinal optic phonons near\n(\u03c0, 0) soften and broaden strongly as holes are doped into the insulating parent\ncompound. Whereas the corresponding breathing mode at (\u03c0, \u03c0) shows much\nsmaller softening and no anomalous broadening. This effect seems to be\ngeneric for cuprates and detailed neutron scattering studies have been reported\nfor La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [16, 17, 18] and YBa2 Cu3 O6+x [18].\n\nCu\na)\n\nO\n\nb)\n\nFigure 1.3 Atomic displacements of oxygen ions (a) for the q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) breathing phonon and\n(b) for the (\u03c0, 0) half-breathing mode.\n\nThe renormalization of these phonons can be calculated in the framework\nof the t-J model, since these modes modulate the energy of a hole in a ZhangRice singlet state, and therefore couple directly to the density of doped holes.\nt2\n\npd\nExpanding the Zhang-Rice energy EZR = 8 \u2206\u01eb\nwith respect to the oxygen\ni\ni\ndisplacements ux , vy (see Fig.1.3) of the four O-neighbors of the Cu-hole\n\n\f8\nyields the linear electron-phonon coupling\nHe\u2212ph = g\n\nX\ni\n\ni\n(uix \u2212 ui\u2212x + vyi \u2212 v\u2212y\n)h+\ni hi .\n\n(1.11)\n\u22127/2\n\nWe assume that the resonance integral obeys the Harrison relation tpd \u221d r0 ,\nwhere r0 is the Cu-O distance, and obtain g = 7EZR /4r0 , i.e., g \u2248 4eV/\u00c5.\nThe lattice part of the Hamiltonian is determined by the force constant K \u2248\n25eV/\u00c52 for the longitudinal O-motion.

This effect is displayed in\nFig.1.6, which shows a rather strong Fano structure in N (q, \u03c9) for q = (\u03c0, 0).\n\n\f10\n\n4.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have outlined a 1/N slave-boson theory for the density response of the\nt-J model, which explains the data obtained by exact diagonalization. We\ndemonstrated that the predicted low energy polaron structure in the density response, which is particularly pronounced along (\u03c0, 0), explains the anomalous\ndoping induced line width and shift of the longitudinal planar (\u03c0, 0) phonon.\nThe energy of the polaron peak is determined by the spinon energy scale, therefore we predict a nontrivial doping dependence for the phonon renormalization.\nIn that respect further neutron scattering studies of the doping dependence of\nphonons would provide a sensitive test for the low energy density response as\nwell as for the spin structure in the different doping regimes.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n\nT.
