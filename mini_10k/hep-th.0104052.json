It is shown that it implies a gauge invariant, additive law giving rise to a\ngauge invariant Z3 -valued global charge in QCD. The total charge contained in a\nregion of the lattice is equal to the flux through its boundary of a certain Z3 -valued,\nadditive quantity. Implications for continuous QCD are discussed.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the basic building blocks of the standard\nmodel for describing elementary particle interactions. During the last decades QCD was\nquite successful, e.g. in describing deep inelastic scattering processes within the framework\nof perturbation theory at one hand and \"measuring\" certain types of observables using\n(nonperturbative) lattice approximation techniques on the other hand. Nonetheless, we\nare still facing the basic challenge, which consists in constructing an effective microscopic\ntheory of interacting hadrons out of this gauge theory. For this purpose, nonperturbative\nmethods for describing the low energy regime should be developed. In particular, the\nobservable algebra and the superselection structure of this theory should be investigated.\nThe present paper is a step in this direction.\nWe stress that standard methods from algebraic quantum field theory for models which\ndo not contain massless particles, see [2], do not apply here. Some progress towards an\nimplementation of similar ideas for theories with massless particles has been made, for\nthe case of quantum electrodynamics (QED) see [3] and [4] and further references therein.\nIn particular, Buchholz developed the concept of so called charge classes and found a\ncriterion for distinguishing between the electric charge (carried by massive particles) and\nadditional superselection sectors corresponding to inequivalent asymptotic infrared clouds\nof photons. For some attempts to deal with the nonabelian case we refer to papers by\nStrocchi and Wightman, see [5] and [6].\nIn QED, the notion of global (electric) charge is easy to understand. This is due\nto the fact, that in this theory we have a local Gauss law, which is built from gauge\ninvariant operators and which is linear. Thus, one can \"sum up\" the local Gauss laws\nover all points of a given (spacelike) hyperplane in space time yielding the following gauge\ninvariant conservation law: The global electric charge is equal to the electric flux through\na 2-sphere at infinity. On the contrary, in QCD the local Gauss law is neither built from\ngauge invariant operators nor is it linear. The main point of the present paper is to show\nthat it is possible to extract from the local Gauss equation of QCD a gauge invariant,\nadditive law for operators with eigenvalues in Z3 , the center of SU(3). This implies \u2013 as\nin QED \u2013 a gauge invariant conservation law: The global Z3 -valued charge is equal to a\nZ3 -valued gauge invariant quantity obtained from the color electric flux at infinity. There\nis a paper by Fredenhagen and Marcu, see [7], dealing with a Z2 -gauge theory (with Z2 valued matter fields) on the lattice. These authors were able to construct the ground state\nand charged states of this model. For some regions in the space of coupling constants, the\nthermodynamic limit of charged states was controlled. It is likely that similar techniques\nwill be relevant for studying Z3 -valued colour charged states of QCD.\nWe stress that our main observation is universal in the following sense: Suppose somebody had constructed a nonperturbative version of QCD rigorously. Then our construction of the global charge would apply. Since, however, such a theory is not at our disposal,\nfor a rigorous discussion we have to restrict ourselves to the case of QCD approximated\n2\n\n\fon a finite lattice. For basic notions concerning lattice gauge theories (including fermions)\nwe refer to [1] and references therein. Thus, we consider QCD on a finite, regular cubic\nlattice in the Hamiltonian approach. Our starting point is the notion of the algebra of\nfield operators. Since, up to our knowledge, this has never been published, we discuss\nit in some detail. By imposing the local Gauss law and gauge invariance we obtain the\nobservable algebra O(\u039b) for QCD on the lattice. For an analogous investigation of the\nsuperselection structure of QED on the lattice we refer to [8] and for a (rather heuristic)\ndiscussion of continuum QCD within the functional integral approach (using only gauge\ninvariant quantities) we refer to [9]. For QED, the mathematical structure of O(\u039b) has\nbeen completely clarified, see [10]. A similar investigation for QCD seems to be a very\ndifficult problem, which will be addressed in the future. In this paper, we concentrate\non a careful analysis of the local Gauss law and its consequences for the notion of global\ncharge in QCD.\nOur paper is organized as follows: In Sections 2 and 3 we discuss the algebra of fields\nand the observable algebra for QCD on a finite lattice. In Section 4 we analyse the local\nGauss law and invent the gauge invariant notion of the local charge densitiy. Using this\nnotion, in Section 5 the global charge is defined and the flux law for QCD is discussed.\nHere also some heuristic remarks concerning the continuum case are added.\n\n2\n\nThe Field Algebra for Lattice QCD\n\nWe consider QCD in the Hamiltonian framework on a finite, regular 3-dimensional lattice\n\u039b. We denote the set of oriented, i-dimensional elements of \u039b by \u039bi , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 . Such\nelements are (in increasing order of i) called sites, links, plaquettes and cubes. The set\nof non-oriented i-dimensional elements will be denoted by |\u039b|i . If, for instance, (x, y) \u2208\n\u039b1 is an oriented link, then by |(x, y)| \u2208 |\u039b|1 we mean the corresponding non-oriented\nlink. Instead of using a concrete Hilbert space representation (e.g. the Schr\u00f6dinger\nrepresentation), we give an abstract definition of the field algebra in terms of generators\nand defining relations.\nThe basic fields of lattice QCD are quarks living at lattice sites and gluons living on\nlinks. The field algebra is thus, by definition, the tensor product of local fermionic and\nbosonic algebras:\nO\nO\nF|(x,y)| .\n(2.1)\nFx\nF (\u039b) :=\n|(x,y)|\u2208|\u039b|1\n\nx\u2208|\u039b|0\n\nWe impose locality of the lattice quantum fields by postulating that the local algebras\ncorresponding to different elements of \u039b commute with each other.\nThe fermionic field algebra Fx associated with a lattice site x is the enveloping algebra\ngenerated from the complex Lie super-algebra Lx of canonical anticommutation relations\nof quarks. In terms of coordinates, the quark field is given by\n|\u039b|0 \u220b x \u2192 (\u03c8 aA (x)) \u2208 Lx ,\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere a stands for bispinorial and (possibly) flavour degrees of freedom and A = 1, 2, 3\nis the colour index corresponding to the fundamental representation of SU(3). The conjugate quark field is denoted by \u03c8 \u2217a A (x) , where we raise and lower indices by the help\nof the canonical hermitian metric tensor gAB in C3 . Finally, the (nontrivial) canonical\nanticommutation relations for elements of Lx read:\n[\u03c8 \u2217a A (x), \u03c8 bB (x)]+ = \u03b4 B A \u03b4 ab .\n\n(2.3)\n\nPassing to self-adjoint generators (real and imaginary parts of \u03c8), we observe that Fx is\na Clifford algebra.\nThe bosonic field algebra F|(x,y)| associated with the non-oriented link |(x, y)| will be\nconstructed in terms of its equivalent copies F(x,y) and F(y,x) , corresponding to the two\norientations of the link (x, y) . We will see that there is a natural identification of these two\nalgebras, induced from the vector character of both the gluonic potential A and the colour\nelectric field E of the underlying continuum theory: under the change of orientation of\nthe k'th axis both Ak and E k change their signs.\nThe bosonic field algebra F(x,y) is, by definition, the tensor product\nF(x,y) := \u1ebc(x,y) \u2297 A(x,y) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\n[e, f ] := eR (f ) ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u1ebc(x,y) is the enveloping algebra of the (real) Lie algebra E(x,y) \u223c\n=\n= su(3) and A(x,y) \u223c\n\u221e\nC (SU(3)) is the commutative \u2217-algebra of smooth functions on the Lie group SU(3) . We\nnote that the above tensor product is naturally endowed with the structure of a crossed\nproduct of Hopf algebras, given by the action of generators of \u1ebc(x,y) on functions, see\n[11]. We identify the tensor product of elements of \u1ebc(x,y) and functions with their product\nas differential operators on SU(3) . This way, F(x,y) gets identified with the algebra of\ndifferential operators on the group manifold. For our purposes, we endow F(x,y) with\na Lie algebra structure. Thus, we have to define the commutator between a generator\ne \u2208 E(x,y) of E \u0303(x,y) and a function f \u2208 A(x,y) ,\n\nwhere eR (f ) denotes the derivative of f with respect to the right-invariant vector field eR\ngenerated by e ,\nd\neR (f )(g) :=\nf (exp(se) * g) , g \u2208 SU(3) .\n(2.6)\nds s=0\nNow we give an explicit description of F(x,y) in terms of generators and defining relations. The algebra A(x,y) is generated by matrix elements of the gluonic gauge potential\non the link (x, y) ,\n\u039b1 \u220b (x, y) \u2192 U A B (x, y) \u2208 A(x,y) ,\n(2.7)\nwhere A, B = 1, 2, 3 are colour indices. Being functions on SU(3) , these generators have\nto fulfil the following relations:\n\u01ebABC\n\n(U A B (x, y))\u2217 UA C (x, y) = \u03b4 C B 1 ,\nU A D (x, y)U B E (x, y)U C F (x, y) = \u01ebDEF 1 .\n4\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\n\fThe algebra E \u0303(x,y) is generated by colour electric fields, spanning the Lie algebra E(x,y) .\nChoosing a basis {ti } , i = 1, . . . , 8, of su(3) we denote by {Ei (x, y)} the corresponding\nbasis of E(x,y) ,\n\u039b1 \u220b (x, y) \u2192 Ei (x, y) := ti \u2208 E(x,y) .\n(2.10)\n\nThese generators are self-adjoint (real), Ei\u2217 = Ei . In the sequel we take as the basis the\nhermitean, traceless Gell-Mann matrices ti A B , normalized as follows:\nX\ni\n\n1\nA C\nC\nti A B ti C D = \u03b4D\n\u03b4B \u2212 \u03b4BA \u03b4D\n,\n3\n\n(2.11)\n\nor, equivalently, ti A B tj B A = \u03b4ij . We will also use the following traceless matrix built\nfrom these fields\nX\nE A B (x, y) =\nEi (x, y)ti A B .\n(2.12)\ni\n\nSince the coefficients ti A B are complex, these fields are no longer self-adjoint:\n(E A B (x, y))\u2217 = EB A (x, y) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe commutation relations between elements of su(3) translated to the language of these\nfields read\n[E A B (x, y), E C D (x, y)] = \u03b4 C B E A D (x, y) \u2212 \u03b4 A D E C B (x, y) ,\n(2.14)\nwhereas the commutation relations (2.5) between Lie algebra elements and functions,\nrewritten in terms of generators, take the following form:\n1\n[E A B (x, y), U C D (x, y)] = \u03b4 C B U A D (x, y) \u2212 \u03b4 A B U C D (x, y) .\n3\n\n(2.15)\n\nObserve that, for every link (x, y) , we have a model of quantum mechanics with\nconfiguration space being the group manifold SU(3) . The matrix elements of the gluonic\npotential play the role of functions of position variables, whereas the colour electric fields\nplay the role of (non-commuting) canonically conjugate momenta. Formula (2.15) is the\nanalog of the canonical commutation relation [p, q] = \u2212i .\nNow, we describe the transformation law of these objects under the change of the link\norientation. This law is an isomorphism between bosonic field algebras:\nI(x,y) : F(x,y) \u2192 F(y,x) .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe vector character of the continuum gauge potential implies that the (classical) SU(3)valued parallel transporter g(x, y) on (x, y) transforms to g \u22121(x, y) under the change of\norientation. Thus, the change of orientation on (x, y) induces the transformation\nSU(3) \u220b g \u2192 i(g) = g \u22121 \u2208 SU(3)\n5\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fon configuration space. This transformation lifts naturally to the field algebra F(x,y) .\nIndeed, for elements of A(x,y) it implies the following transformation law\nA(x,y) \u220b f \u2192 f \u0306 \u2208 A(y,x) ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere f \u0306(g) := f (g \u22121 ) . We thus put I(x,y) (0, f ) := (0, f \u0306). It may be easily proved that the\nunique \u2217-isomorphism, which fulfils this requirement is given by\nI(x,y) (e, f ) := (eL , f \u0306) ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere eL is the left invariant vector field on SU(3) generated by \u2212e. It acts on functions\nin the following way:\nd\neL (f )(g) =\nf (g * exp(\u2212se)) .\n(2.20)\nds s=0\nObserve that eL is not an element of E(y,x) , but it can be expanded with respect to\nright-invariant vector fields with coefficients being functions on the group. Actually, the\nfollowing formula is easily proved:\neL = \u2212\n\n8\nX\n\nTr(geg \u22121ti )tR\ni ,\n\n(2.21)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ti is any orthonormal basis of su(3).\nTo prove that I(x,y) is an isomorphism indeed, we observe that it is obviously a bijective\nmapping between generators. It extends to an isomorphism of field algebras if we prove\nthat it preserves the commutator. This is obvious for elements, which either belong both\nto A(x,y) or to E(x,y) . Thus, it is sufficient to consider the commutator of a Lie algebra\nelement e with a function f . Using the identity\neR (f )(g) =\n\nd\nds\n\ns=0\n\nf (exp(se) * g) =\n\nd\nds\n\ns=0\n\nf \u0306(g \u22121 * exp(\u2212se)) = eL (f \u0306)(g \u22121) ,\n\n(2.22)\n\nand applying I(x,y) to the functions on both sides, we obtain due to (2.5) and (2.18):\n\u0002\n\u0003\nI(x,y) ([e, f ]) = I(x,y) (eR (f )) = eL (f \u0306) = I(x,y) (e), I(x,y) (f ) .\n\n(2.23)\n\nThis shows that I(x,y) is an isomorphism, indeed. We add that, in more abstract terms,\nit is given by I(x,y) (e, f ) = (\u2212i\u2217 (e), i\u2217 (f )) .\nField configurations, which are related under I(x,y) will be identified as different representations of the same object. Thus, the bosonic field algebra F|(x,y)| , associated with\nthe non-oriented link |(x, y)| , is defined as the subalgebra of F(x,y) \u00d7 F(y,x) , obtained by\nthis identification:\n\b\nF|(x,y)| := (l(x,y) , k(y,x) ) \u2208 F(x,y) \u00d7 F(y,x) : k(y,x) = I(x,y) (l(x,y) ) .\n(2.24)\n6\n\n\fProjection onto the first (resp. second) component gives us an isomorphism of F|(x,y)| with\nF(x,y) (resp. F(y,x) ).\nThe above transformation law yields relations between generators of the two algebras.\nFor functions on SU(3), formula (2.8) enables us to rewrite (2.18) as follows:\nU A B (y, x) = (UB A (x, y))\u2217 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nFor Lie algebra elements, formula (2.21) applied to e = ti reads:\nEj (y, x) = \u2212\n\n8\nX\n\nU A B (x, y)tj B C U C D (y, x)ti D A Ei (x, y) ,\n\n(2.26)\n\ni=1\n\nor, in terms of generators E A B (x, y) ,\nE A B (y, x) = \u2212U A D (y, x)U C B (x, y)E D C (x, y) .\n\n(2.27)\n\nTo summarize, the field algebra F (\u039b) is the \u2217-algebra, generated by elements\n\b aA\n\u03c8 (x) , U A B (x, y) , E A B (x, y) ,\n\nfulfilling relations (2.8), (2.9), (2.13), (2.25) and (2.27), together with canonical (anti-)\ncommutation relations\n[\u03c8 \u2217a A (x), \u03c8 bB (y)]+ = \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\u03b4 B A \u03b4 ab ,\n\u0002 A\n\u0003\n\u0001\nE B (x, y), E C D (u, z) = \u03b4(x \u2212 u)\u03b4(y \u2212 z) \u03b4 C B E A D (x, y) \u2212 \u03b4 A D E C B (x, y) ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0002 A\n\u0003\n1 A C\nC\nC\nA\nE B (x, y), U D (u, z) = + \u03b4(x \u2212 u)\u03b4(y \u2212 z) \u03b4 B U D (x, y) \u2212 \u03b4 B U D (x, y)\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 A C\nA\nC\n\u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 z)\u03b4(y \u2212 u) \u03b4 D U B (y, x) \u2212 \u03b4 B U D (y, x) .\n3\n\n3\n\nThe Observable Algebra\n\nThe observable algebra O(\u039b) is defined by imposing the local Gauss law and gauge invariance.\nThe group of local gauge transformations acts on F (\u039b) by automorphisms x \u2192 g A B (x)\nas follows:\n\u03c8 aA (x) \u2192 g A B (x)\u03c8 aB (x) ,\n\n(3.28)\n\u22121 D\n\nB (y)\n\n,\n\n(3.29)\n\n\u22121 D\n\nB (x)\n\n.\n\n(3.30)\n\nU A B (x, y) \u2192 g A C (x)U C D (x, y)(g )\n\nE A B (x, y) \u2192 g A C (x)E C D (x, y)(g )\n7\n\n\fIt is easy to check that these transformations are generated by\nX\nG A B (x) := \u03c1A B (x) \u2212\nE A B (x, y) ,\n\n(3.31)\n\ny\n\nwhere\n\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n1 A \u2217aC\n\u2217aA\na\na\n\u03c1 B (x) =\n\u03c8 (x)\u03c8 B (x) \u2212 \u03b4B \u03c8 (x)\u03c8 C (x)\n3\na\nA\n\n(3.32)\n\nis the local matter charge density. Observe that \u03c1A A (x) = 0 .\nTo implement gauge invariance we have to take those elements of F (\u039b) , which commute with all generators G A B (x) . Thus, the subalgebra of gauge invariant\bfields is, by\ndefinition, the commutant A(G)\u2032 of the algebra A(G) , generated by the set G A B (x) .\nThe local Gauss law at x \u2208 \u039b0 has the form\nX\nE A B (x, y) = \u03c1A B (x) ,\n(3.33)\ny\n\nwith the sum taken over all points y adjacent to x . Imposing it on the subalgebra A(G)\u2032\nof gauge invariant fields means factorizing the latter with respect to I(\u039b) \u2229 A(G)\u2032 , where\nI(\u039b) is the ideal generated by (3.33). Thus, the observable algebra is defined as follows:\nO(\u039b) := A(G)\u2032 /{I(\u039b) \u2229 A(G)\u2032 } .\n\n(3.34)\n\nObviously, every element of O(\u039b) is represented by a gauge invariant element of F (\u039b)\nand O(\u039b) can be viewed as a \u2217-subalgebra of F (\u039b) generated by gauge invariant bosonic\ncombinations of U and E and by gauge invariant combinations of \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 of mesonic\nand baryonic type, with the Gauss law inducing some identities between those generators.\nIt will be shown in the next section that there is a (gauge invariant), additive law,\nobtained by combining these two equations, which characterizes the local colour charge\ndensity carried by the lattice quantum fields. Additivity will allow us to obtain the global\ncolour charge by adding up the local Gauss laws. In a subsequent paper we will show\nthat the irreducible representations of O(\u039b) are labeled by this global charge. This way,\nwe get the physical Hilbert space Hphys as a direct sum of colour charge superselection\nsectors. The similar problem for QED on the lattice was solved in [8].\n\n4\n\nThe Local Charge density\n\nIn this section we are going to analyze the local Gauss law (3.33). Suppose, for that\npurpose, that we are given a collection of operators F A B in a Hilbert space H, fulfilling\nF A A = 0 and (F A B )\u2217 = FB A , realizing the canonical commutation relations for the Lie\nalgebra su(3):\n[F A B , F C D ] = \u03b4 C B F A D \u2212 \u03b4 A D F C B .\n(4.1)\n8\n\n\fThe field algebra F (\u039b) provides us with two basic examples of this type: the electric\nfield E A B (x, y) on each lattice link, see (2.14), and the charge operator \u03c1A B (x) at each\nlattice site, given by formula (3.32). Indeed, due to canonical anticommutation relations\n(2.3), the latter fulfills (4.1). Thus, the operators occurring on both sides of the local\nGauss law fulfill (4.1).\nThroughout this paper, we assume integrability of the Lie algebra representations\nunder consideration. This means that for each F there exists a unitary representation of\nthe group SU(3)\nSU(3) \u220b g \u2192 F\u0304 (g) \u2208 B(H) ,\n(4.2)\nassociated with F .\nIt is easy to check that if F and G are two commuting representations of su(3) then\nalso F + G is. Indeed, if F\u0304 (g) and \u1e20(g) are representations of SU(3) corresponding to F and G, then F + G may be obtained by differentiating the representation\nSU(3) \u220b g \u2192 F\u0304 (g)\u1e20(g) \u2208 B(H), where B(H) denotes the C \u2217 -algebra of bounded operators on H. Moreover, \u2212F \u2217 is also a representation of su(3), corresponding to the following\nrepresentation of SU(3): SU(3) \u220b g \u2192 (F\u0304 (g \u22121 ))\u2217 \u2208 B(H).\nSuch a collection of operators is an operator domain in the sense of Woronowicz (see\n[12]). We are going to construct an operator function on this domain, i. e. a mapping\nF \u2192 \u03c6(F ) which satisfies \u03c6(UF U \u22121 ) = U\u03c6(F )U \u22121 for an arbitrary isometry U. We are\ngoing to prove that this function has the following properties:\n\u03c6(\u2212F \u2217 ) = \u2212\u03c6(F ) ,\n\u03c6(F + G) = \u03c6(F ) + \u03c6(G) ,\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\nfor commuting F and G. This function will be built from the two gauge-invariant, selfadjoint and commuting (Casimir) operators K2 and K3 of F :\nK2 = F A B F B A\n\u0001\n1 A B C\nK3 =\nF B F C F A + F AB F C AF B C .\n2\n\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nThe Hilbert space H splits into the direct sum of subspaces H\u03b1 on which F acts\nirreducibly. Each of these subspaces is a common eigenspace of K2 and K3 . Denoting the\nhighest weight characterizing a given irreducible representation by (m, n), with m and n\nbeing nonnegative integers, the eigenvalues k2 and k3 of K2 and K3 are given by:\n2 2\n(m + mn + n2 + 3m + 3n) ,\n3\n1\n(m \u2212 n)(3 + 2m + n)(3 + m + 2n) .\n=\n9\n\nk2 =\n\n(4.7)\n\nk3\n\n(4.8)\n\nIt is easy to check that the above formulae may be uniquely solved with respect to m and\n9\n\n\fn yielding:\n!\n\u221a\n2\n6k3\n1\n+ \u03c0 +\nm = M(k2 , k3 ) :=\narccos p\n3\n(k2 + 2)3 3\n!\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n6k3\n2 cos\n\u2212 1,\n(4.9)\narccos p\n3\n(k2 + 2)3\n!\n\u221a\n\u0012\nq\n1\n2\n6k\n3\narccos p\nn = N(k2 , k3 ) := \u2212 23 (k2 + 2) 2 cos\n+ \u03c0 +\n3\n(k2 + 2)3 3\n!\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n6k3\ncos\n\u2212 1.\n(4.10)\narccos p\n3\n(k2 + 2)3\nq\n\n\u0012\n2\n(k + 2) cos\n3 2\n\nUsing these functions we may define a function with values in Z3 , which may be identified\nwith the center C of the gauge group SU(3):\nf (k2 , k3 ) := (M(k2 , k3 ) \u2212 N(k2 , k3 )) mod 3 .\n\n(4.11)\n\nFor our purposes it is convenient to use the parametrization Z3 = (\u22121, 0, 1). Since K2\nand K3 are commuting and self-adjoint, there exists an operator-valued function:\n\u03c6(F ) = f (K2 (F ), K3 (F )) .\n\n(4.12)\n\nThis means that \u03c6(F ) may take eigenvalues \u22121, 0, 1 and that every irreducible subspace\nH\u03b1 is an eigenspace of \u03c6(F ) with eigenvalue m \u2212 n mod 3.\nTo prove property (4.3) observe that K2 (\u2212F \u2217 ) = K2 (F ), whereas K3 (\u2212F \u2217 ) = \u2212K3 (F ).\nConsequently, due to (4.7) and (4.8), we have M(k2 , \u2212k3 ) = N(k2 , k3 ) and N(k2 , \u2212k3 ) =\nM(k2 , k3) which implies (4.3). It remains to prove property (4.4). Let there be given two\ncommuting\nF and G, of su(3) in H. Denote the irreducible components\n\b Frepresentations, \b\nof F by H\u03b1 and of G by H\u03b2G . The irreducible spaces may be chosen in such a way\nthat H decomposes as follows:\nM\nH=\nH\u03b1F \u2229 H\u03b2G .\n(4.13)\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nTake 0 6= x \u2208 H\u03b1F \u2229 H\u03b2G and consider the space HxF +G \u2282 H generated by vectors\n{F\u0304 (g)\u1e20(g)x}, g \u2208 SU(3) , where F\u0304 and \u1e20 are the corresponding (\"integrated\") representations of SU(3). By construction, HxF +G carries an irreducible representation of\nF\u0304 \u1e20 . There exists a canonical embedding\nHxF +G \u220b y \u2192 T (y) \u2208 H\u03b1F \u2297 H\u03b2G ,\ngiven by\n\n\u0001\nT F\u0304 (g)\u1e20(g)x := F\u0304 (g)x \u2297 \u1e20(g)x ,\n10\n\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n\n\fintertwining the representation F\u0304 \u1e20 with F\u0304 \u2297 \u1e20. This means that F\u0304 \u1e20, acting on HxF +G , is\nequivalent to one of the irreducible components of F\u0304 \u2297 \u1e20. Passing again to representations\nof the Lie algebra su(3), we conclude that F + G, acting on HxF +G , is equivalent to one of\nthe irreducible components of F \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 G, acting on H\u03b1F \u2297 H\u03b2G . Now, property (4.4)\nfollows from the following\nLemma 1 Let there be given two irreducible representations (m, n) and (m\u2032 , n\u2032 ) of su(3),\ntogether with the decomposition of their tensor product into irreducible components,\n(m, n) \u2297 (m\u2032 , n\u2032 ) = (m1 , n1 ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 (mp , np ) .\n\n(4.16)\n\n(m \u2212 n) mod 3 + (m\u2032 \u2212 n\u2032 ) mod 3 = (mi \u2212 ni ) mod 3 ,\n\n(4.17)\n\nThen we have\n\nfor every i = 1, . . . , p .\nProof: We use the classification of irreducible representations in terms of Youngtableaux. For su(3), the following two equations hold:\n1. The number of boxes constituting the Young-tableau of (mi , ni ) equals the sum of\nboxes of the tableaux corresponding to (m,n) and (m',n') minus 3p, where p is a\nnonnegative integer.\n2. The number of boxes of an arbitrary irreducible representation of su(3) is equal to\nm + 2n \u2261 m \u2212 n + 3n .\n\nTaking the first equation modulo three and using the second equation yields the thesis.\nApplying the operator function \u03c6 to the local Gauss law (3.33) and using additivity\n(4.4) of \u03c6 we obtain:\nX\n\u03c6(E(x, y)) = \u03c6(\u03c1(x)) .\n(4.18)\ny\n\nThis is a gauge invariant equation for operators with eigenvalues in Z3 , valid at every\nlattice site x. The quantity on the right hand side is the (gauge invariant) local colour\ncharge density carried by the quark field.\n\n5\n\nThe Global Charge and the Flux Law\n\nUsing the commutation relation between E and U, transformation law (2.27) for E(x, y)\nmay be rewritten in three equivalent ways:\n8\nE A B (y, x) = U A D (y, x)E D C (x, y)U C B (x, y) + \u03b4BA\n3\n8\n= \u2212U C B (x, y)E D C (x, y)U A D (y, x) \u2212 \u03b4BA\n3\nD\nA\nC\n= \u2212E C (x, y)U D (y, x)U B (x, y) .\n11\n\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\n(5.3)\n\n\fThese equations imply that\nK2 (E(x, y)) = K2 (E(y, x)) ,\n\nK3 (E(x, y)) = \u2212K3 (E(y, x)) .\n\n(5.4)\n\nHence, we have:\n\u03c6(E(x, y)) + \u03c6(E(y, x)) = 0 ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nfor every lattice bond (x, y).\nNow we take the sum of equations (4.18) over all lattice sites x \u2208 \u039b. Due to the above\nidentity, all terms on the left hand side cancel, except for contributions coming from the\nboundary. This way we obtain the total flux through the boundary \u2202\u039b of \u039b:\nX\n\u03a6\u2202\u039b :=\n\u03c6(E(x, \u221e)) ,\n(5.6)\nx\u2208\u2202\u039b\n\nwhere by E(x, \u221e) we denote the colour electric charge along the external link, connecting\nthe point x on the boundary of \u039b with the \"rest of the world\". On the right hand side\nwe get the (gauge invariant) global colour charge, carried by the matter field\nX\nQ\u039b =\n\u03c6(\u03c1(x)) .\n(5.7)\nx\u2208\u039b\n\nBoth quantities appearing in the global Gauss law\n\u03a6\u2202\u039b = Q\u039b ,\n\n(5.8)\n\ntake values in the center Z3 of SU(3). The \"sum modulo three\" is the composition law\nin Z3 .\nIn the above discussion we have admitted non-zero values of E(x, \u221e) at boundary\npoints x \u2208 \u2202\u039b . In the remainder of this section we make some remarks on the nature of\nthese objects. Our discussion will be rather heuristical, some points will be made precise\nin a subsequent paper.\ne Then the boundary flux operators\n1. One may treat \u039b as a piece of a bigger lattice \u039b.\ne and commute with F (\u039b), (and also with O(\u039b) ). They are\nE(x, \u221e) belong to F (\u039b)\nexternal from the point of view of F (\u039b) and measure the \"violation of the local\nGauss law\" on the boundary \u2202\u039b :\nX\nE(x, \u221e) := \u03c1(x) \u2212\nE(y, x) .\n(5.9)\ny\n\nNon-vanishing of this element is equivalent to gauge dependence of quantum states\nunder the action of boundary gauges g(x) \u2208 SU(3) , x \u2208 \u2202\u039b . Let us discuss this\npoint in more detail. Every irreducible representation of SU(3) is equivalent to\n12\n\n\fsome tensor representation. More precisely, denote by Tnm (C3 ) the space of mcontravariant, n-covariant tensors over C3 , endowed with the natural scalar product\n3\nm\n3\ninduced by the scalar product on C3 . Let Tm\nn (C ) \u2282 Tn (C ) be the subspace of\nirreducible, i. e. completely symmetric and traceless tensors. These tensors form a\nHilbert space T (C3 ) defined as the direct sum\nM\n3\nT (C3 ) :=\nTm\n(5.10)\nn (C ) .\nm,n\n\nUnder gauge transformations at x \u2208 \u2202\u039b, physical states of QCD on \u039b behave like\n3\nelements of T (C3 ), whereas the subspaces Tm\nn (C ) correspond to eigenspaces of the\ninvariant operators N(E(x, \u221e)) and M(E(x, \u221e)), constructed from external fluxes\n(5.9). If one wants to include all these gauge invariant operators into an axiomatic\nformulation, as given in Section 2, one has different options. The remarks at the\nbeginning of this point suggest to postulate that these operators commute with\nall elements of the observable algebra O(\u039b). This corresponds to treating external\nfluxes as purely classical objects, describing extra superselection rules (cf. [4], [5],\n[6]).\n2. Our results concerning the charge superselection structure of QED on a finite lattice\n[8] suggest, however, a second option. In [8] all irreducible representations of the\nobservable algebra were classified in terms of the global electric charge Q\u039b contained\nin \u039b. Representations differing only by the local electric flux distribution over the\nboundary \u2202\u039b, but having the same value of the global flux \u03a6\u2202\u039b were proved to\nbe equivalent. The redistribution of fluxes is obtained by the action of certain\nunitary operators, see [8], acting on the quantum state under consideration. Such a\nredistribution operator has the following (heuristic) counterpart in continuum QED:\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\ni\n3\nU(n) := exp\nn(x) * A(x) d x ,\n(5.11)\n~ \u03a3\nwhere n = (nk ) is a divergence-free (i. e. fulfilling \u2202k nk \u2261 0) vector-density on\n\u03a3 \u2282 R3 . Formally, we have:\n\u1ebc k (x) := (U \u2217 (n)E(x)U(n))k = E k (x) + nk (x) .\n\n(5.12)\n\nIt is obvious that replacing the field E by \u1ebc and leaving all other observables unchanged gives an equivalent representation of the observable algebra. Nevertheless,\nthe flux field on the boundary \u2202\u03a3 of the domain \u03a3 is changed by n\u22a5 (x), where \"\u22a5\"\ndenotes the component orthogonal to \u2202\u03a3.\nIn a subsequent paper we are going to present a similar result for lattice QCD.\nWe shall prove that all irreducible representations of the observable algebra O(\u039b)\nof QCD on a finite lattice are classified by the value of the global colour charge\n13\n\n\fQ\u039b , yielding three different superselection sectors labeled by elements of Z3 . However, the local distribution of the (gauge invariant) gluon and anti-gluon fluxes\nM(E(x, \u221e)) and N(E(x, \u221e)) over the boundary \u2202\u039b may be arbitrarily changed\nwithin one sector. The redistribution of fluxes is obtained by the following procedure. Take an arbitrary pair of points \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202\u039b at the boundary and a path\n(collection of lattice links) \u03b3 = {(\u03be, x1 ), (x1 , x2 ), . . . , (xk , \u03b7)},\n\u0001 connecting them. DeA\nfine the following operator-valued matrix U(\u03b3) = U B (\u03b3) , where\n1\nU A B (\u03b3) := \u221a U A C1 (\u03be, x1 )U C1 C2 (x1 , x2 ) . . . U Ck B (xk , \u03b7) .\n3\n\n(5.13)\n\n\u0001\nThe action of U(\u03b3) on a quantum state \u03c8 is, by definition, a collection U A B (\u03b3)\u03c8\nwith an extra contravariant index A at \u03be and an extra covariant index B at \u03b7. In\ngeneral, the new state does not belong to any irreducible representation of SU(3)\nat \u03be and \u03b7, even if \u03c8 did. This means that U(\u03b3)\u03c8 is not an eigenstate of operators\nM(E(\u03be, \u221e)), N(E(\u03be, \u221e)), M(E(\u03b7, \u221e)) and N(E(\u03b7, \u221e)), even if \u03c8 was. Decomposing it into irreducible representations, we observe, however, that the value of\n\u03c6(E(\u03be, \u221e)) has been changed by plus one and the value of \u03c6(E(\u03b7, \u221e)) has been\nchanged by minus one by this procedure. This suggests, that these objects should\nbe rather treated as quantum and not as classical quantities. Only their sum, the\nglobal flux \u03a6\u2202\u039b , is a classical object proportional to the identity on every superselection sector. This point of view was strongly advocated by Staruszkiewicz already\na decade ago (see [13]). We also refer to Giulini [14], who discussed decoherence\nphenomena in QED in terms of quantum fluxes at infinity.\n3. Finally, we stress that it does not make sense to attribute any physical meaning to\nthe external gluon or anti-gluon fluxes M and N themselves. It is only the quantity\n(M \u2212 N) \"modulo three\" which makes sense. Heuristically, this again can be made\ntransparent for the continuum theory: Indeed, if we want to assign the value of the\nflux through a piece S \u2282 \u2202\u03a3 of the boundary of a domain \u03a3, we must be able to\nintegrate E over\nS S. Suppose, for that purpose, that S has been divided into small\nportions, S = \u03b1 S\u03b1 . We have\nZ\nXZ\nE.\n(5.14)\nE=\nS\n\n\u03b1\n\nS\u03b1\n\nThe functions M, N or even (M \u2212 N) are not additive and, therefore, cannot be\napplied to the left hand side in a way which is compatible with the Riemann sums\narising in the integration. On the other hand, the function \u03c6 is additive. This\nenables us, in principle, to define the local Z3 -valued flux through S as the sum\nof fluxes corresponding to its small portions S\u03b1 . Hence, if (one day in the future)\ncontinuum QCD will be constructed as an appropriate limit of lattice theories,\n14\n\n\falso these surface fluxes will be defined as limits of appropriate Riemann sums,\ncorresponding to these lattice approximations. We conclude that the only additive,\ngauge invariant aspect of both the colour charge density \u03c1 and the surface fluxes E\nis carried by the Z3 -valued quantities \u03c6(\u03c1) and \u03c6(E).\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are very much indebted to J.
