Reggeization sums a series of stronglyordered collinear emissions resulting in an overall Reggeon exchange that falls in the Glauber or\nCoulomb kinematic region. This is an extremely multi-scale problem and appears to fall outside of\nthe usual organizing scheme of SCET.\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the 1960's it was discovered, through a combination of general principles and phenomenology, that the\nhigh energy behavior of hadron scattering amplitudes is\ngoverned by Regge exchanges, in particular by Pomeron\nexchange[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The region of applicability for\nthese techniques is\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nt fixed\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s, t are the usual Mandelstam variables. While\nit is known how Regge behavior emerges in a field theory, the original applications were not derived from any\nfundamental theory of the strong interactions. With the\nadvent of QCD, Regge behavior has also been found for\nquarks and gluons[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. These are\napplicable in the Regge region as long as t is large enough\nthat a perturbative treatment is possible. This has led\nto concepts such as the \"Reggeized gluon\" and the \"hard\nPomeron\". Most recently, these ideas have been revived\nin the experiments at HERA[15]. While the \"hard\" and\n\"soft\" Reggeon regions are phenomenologically distinct,\nboth types of behavior exist1 .\nIn a more recent development, an effective field theory\nfor the QCD interactions of very high energy quarks and\ngluons has been formulated. This separates the high energy degrees of freedom interacting with a high energy\nparticle into collinear modes and soft modes, hence the\n\nname Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET)[16, 17, 18,\n19, 20, 21]. This theory has been very useful in organizing theoretical calculations, especially in the decays of\nheavy hadrons and high energy phenomena.\nIf the high energy behavior of scattering amplitudes is\ndominated by Regge exchange, one should expect that\nthese ideas must also find a description within a theory\nsuch as SCET that describes the high energy degrees of\nfreedom. To this end we here discuss the ideas of Regge\ntheory in the language of SCET. There must be a region\nof compatibility of these two approaches. It turns out\nthat a Reggeon exchange is an unusual object in SCET,\none which emerges from a ordered series of collinear exchanges but which produces an object of a different character.\nThe relevance of Regge exchange for phenomenology\nfollows from the emergence of power-law behavior for\nscattering amplitudes. An amplitude that behaves like\n(\u03b1s ln s)n in some order of perturbation theory sums to\ns\u03b1(t) in the Regge region. Note that the traditional notation for a Regge exponent \u03b1(t) should not be confused\nwith the QCD coupling \u03b1s . The latter will always carry\nthe subscript s in this paper. Since Reggeized gluons\nand the hard Pomeron (and also the soft Pomeron) carry\n\u03b1(t) > 0, this can lead to an enhanced power behavior\nof interactions in the Regge region, with an effect larger\nthan estimated in naive perturbative power counting.\n\n2.\n\n\u2217 Email:\n\ndonoghue@physics.umass.edu\nwyler@physik.unizh.ch\nNote that the word \"soft\" in traditional hadronic usage differs\nsomewhat from the same word in the Soft Collinear theory, which\nhas a more technical definition described below.\n\n\u2020 Email:\n1\n\nKINEMATIC REGIONS\n\nThe asymptotic Regge behavior comes from the summation of the ladder graphs shown in Figure 1. In this\nfigure we treat all particles as scalars because we are primarily interested in kinematics, although we will refer to\nthe particles as gluons.\n\n\f2\np1\n\np\u20321 = p1 + q\n\ns \u2192 \u221e, t fixed. Let us define a small parameter\np\n\u03bb = \u2212t/s .\n\n(3)\n\nBy definition, the Reggeon then has momentum\nq 2 = \u2212s\u03bb2\n\n(4)\n\nThe individual components can be found from the onshell condition for the final particles\np2\n\np\u20322 = p2 \u2212 q\n\nFIG. 1: The ladder graphs\n\np1\n\np2\n\np\u20321 = p1 + q\n\np\u20322 = p2 \u2212 q\n\nFIG. 2: The cut ladder graphs\n\nThese ladder diagrams can be interpreted in a couple of\nways. If one is concerned with the net effect of the ladder\nsum, one sees it as the t channel exchange of a single\nobject - a Reggeon. Alternatively we can reconstruct the\nkinematic behavior of the ladder sum from consideration\nof the discontinuities in the diagrams, and the relevant\ndiscontinuities turn out to be those where the cut lines\nare the rungs of the ladder, as in Fig 2. In this picture the\nReggeon corresponds to the emission of on-shell particles\nin the s-channel.\nWe describe the scattering process p1 + p2 \u2192 p\u20321 + p\u20322 ,\nwhere as usual s = (p1 + p2 )2 , t = (p1 \u2212 p\u20321 )2 and\nu = (p1 \u2212 p\u20322 )2 . Defining a right-moving light-like fourvector n\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 1) and a left-moving one n\u0304\u03bc =\n(1, 0, 0, \u22121), we display momenta in light-cone coordinates p = (p+ , p\u2212 , p\u22a5 ), with p+ = n\u03bc p\u03bc , p\u2212 = n\u0304\u03bc p\u03bc . In\nthese coordinates an invariant mass is p2 = p+ p\u2212 \u2212 p\u22a5 2 .\nWe treat particle 1 as right-moving in the center of mass,\nand particle 2 as left-moving,\np1 = (p+\np2 = (0, p\u2212\n(2)\n1 , 0, 0)\n2 , 0)\n\u221a\n\u2212\nwith p+\ns.\n1 = p2 =\nAs mentioned, the kinematic region of Regge theory is\n\n(p1 + q)2 = 0 \u21d2 (p1 + q)+ q \u2212 \u2212 q2\u22a5 = 0\n(p2 \u2212 q)2 = 0 \u21d2 \u2212(p2 \u2212 q)\u2212 q + \u2212 q2\u22a5 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nThis implies that the components of the Reggeon are of\norder\n\u221a\nq \u223c s(\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb)\n(6)\nSince the only principle used in this relation was the\nkinematics of the external particles, we can see an important and general feature. To connect an energetic\nright-moving particle with an energetic left-mover, with\nlimited momentum exchange, one requires an exchanged\nparticle which is dominated by the transverse momentum. This kinematic configuration has been called either\nCoulombic or Glauber[22], as it is typical of the region\nof Coulomb exchange at very high energies.\nIn SCET one also classifies the momenta by powers of\na small scale. The standard names and scaling properties\nfor these are\n\u221a\nCollinear \u21d2 p \u223c s(1, \u03bb2 , \u03bb),\np2 \u223c s\u03bb2\n\u221a\nSoft \u21d2\np \u223c s(\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb),\np2 \u223c s\u03bb2\n\u221a 2 2 2\np2 \u223c s\u03bb4 (7)\nUltra \u2212 soft \u21d2 p \u223c s(\u03bb , \u03bb , \u03bb ),\nHardly studied in SCET is the Glauber region[23]\n\u221a\nGlauber \u21d2\np \u223c s(\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb),\np2 \u223c s\u03bb2\n\n(8)\n\nThe Glauber region can be considered as an endpoint of\nthe soft region in which the longitudinal momenta are\nparticulary small, but the key feature describing the region is that the dominant component is the transverse\nmomentum, which itself is of order \u03bb. There does not\nexist a consistent treatment of this region yet.\nIn SCETI , the small parameter is taken as\np\n\u03bbI = \u039b/Q\n(9)\nwith Q being a large scale, and in SCETII , the parameter\nis\n\u03bbII = \u039b/Q\n\n(10)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nSince Q \u223c s, our parameter\nis close to \u03bbII , if \u039b \u223c \u2212t.\n\u221a\n(Note however that \u2212t can still be much larger than the\nscale of QCD, \u039bQCD .)\nWhile the overall Reggeon exchange corresponds to an\nobject which is in the Glauber kinematic regime, we will\n\n\f3\nsee that the components that make up the legs and rungs\nof the ladder diagrams in general do not fit this classification, but are rather an ordered set of mostly collinear particles. Within this ordering scheme there is another small\nparameter which differentiates the ladder rungs from ordinary collinear particles. This extra ordering parameter\nis at present not included in the SCET classification.\n\n3.\n\nKINEMATICS OF INTERNAL LINES IN THE\nLADDER SUM\n\nIn this section we review the field theory treatment\nof Regge exchange in order to make the connection to\nSCET. Our interest is in understanding the nature of the\ngluon kinematics for the internal lines within the ladder\nsum. The derivations of this section are well known in\nthe Regge community and can be found in standard texts.\nThe novel aspect is the rephrasing of the results within\nthe context of SCET.\nRegge behavior is readily found in field theory. The\nladder diagrams in general will depend on both s and t.\nAs s \u2192 \u221e, only a tiny corner of the loop integration\nregion will give the leading contribution. In this region\nthe n-loop diagram yields\ng2\n[\u03b2(t) ln(\u2212s)]n\ns n!\n\n3.1.\n\nDiscontinuities of the ladder diagram\n\nIt is easier to understand the kinematics internal to the\nladder sum if we use the fact that the leading behavior\ncan be reconstructed from the discontinuity in the ladder\ndiagram[13, 25]. As usual the relationship is\n1\n[ln(\u2212s)]n\nn!\n\n\u03c0\n[ln(s)]n\u22121\n(n \u2212 1)!\n(16)\nso that the discontinuity will contain one less power of\nln(s). There is a thorough treatment of this approach in\nthe fine lecture notes of Forshaw and Ross[13].\nThe discontinuity puts all the particles across the cut\non their mass shell. The imaginary part of the diagram\ncomes then directly from this on-shell configuration and\nthe real part comes from particles in the neighborhood\nof the on-shell point. The relevant discontinuities of the\nbox diagram and the three-rung ladder are shown in Fig.\n3, while the general diagram was previously shown in Fig\n2.\nAmp \u223c\n\np1\n\ng2\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\ndy1 dy2\n\n\u03b4(1 \u2212 y1 \u2212 y2 )\n[y1 y2 t \u2212 m2 (y1 + y2 )]\n\nk1 + q\n\n(11)\np\u20322\n\np2 + k 1\n(a)\n\n(12)\n\np21\n\np\u20321\n\np1 \u2212 k 1\nk1\n\n(13)\n\nk1 + q\n\nk1 \u2212 k2\n\nk2 + q\n\nk2\n\nwith the Regge exponent\n\u03b1(t) = \u22121 + \u03b2(t)\n\np\u20321\n\nk1\n\nHere g is the coupling constant at each vertex in the ladder diagram.

The propagators for the horizontal rungs do not appear in this result and the asymptotic\nbehavior can be found from a \"pinched\" graph where horzontal lines are ommitted. The factor \u03b2(t) corresponds\nto the two-dimensional integral over the transverse momenta of the vertical legs.\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: The discontinuity of the box diagram and of the\nthree-rung diagram.\n\nFor the box diagram of Figure 3a, it is immediately\nclear from the argument given in Sec 2 that the exchanged gluons fall in the Glauber or Coulombic regime.\nIn each half of the diagram, the exchanged particle connects an on-shell right moving particle to an on-shell left\nmover. By the argument of Sec. 2 the exchanged particle then must satisfy Eq. 6. However, this kinematic\ncondition is not common to all the ladder diagrams, as\nwe will see next.\nThe first non-trivial example - the three rung ladder of\n\n\f4\nFig. 3b displays what turns out to be the typical pattern\nin the ladder sum.\nLet us label the exchanged gluon momenta - the vertical leg - with an extra minus sign convention\nki =\n\n(ki+ , \u2212ki\u2212 , ki \u22a5 )\n\n(17)\n\nThis convention is connected to the choice to draw the\nmomentum flowing down the ladder rather than up it will save many minus signs and reversed inequalities\nin what follows.

This implies\nthat all of the remaining propagators in P (k1 , k2 ) are\nlargely transverse. For example,\nk12 \u2212 m2 = \u2212k1+ k1\u2212 \u2212 k21\u22a5 \u2212 m2\n(31)\n\u2248 \u2212\u03b7k21\u22a5 \u2212 k21\u22a5 \u2212 m2 \u2248 \u2212(k21\u22a5 + m2 )\ni.e. the longitudinal components can be neglected and\nthe propagator is transverse. In this case the constraint\nintegral can be easily done\nZ \u03b7 \u221as\nI1 =\ndk1+ dk2\u2212 \u03b4(k1+ k2\u2212 \u2212 (k21\u22a5 \u2212 k22\u22a5 ))\n\u221a\n\u03b7 s\n\ndk1+\n+\n\u2206k2\u22a5 / s k1\ns\n= ln( 2 2\n) \u2192 ln(s)\n\u03b7 (k1\u22a5 \u2212 k22\u22a5 )\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the final limit is valid as s \u2192 \u221e. Completing the\ncalculation of the discontinuity in this region then leads\nto\nZ\nDisc \u223c ln(s) d2 k1\u22a5 d2 k2\u22a5\n(33)\n\u00d7\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nk21\u22a5 \u2212 m2 k22\u22a5 \u2212 m2 (k1 \u2212 q)2\u22a5 \u2212 m2 (k2 \u2212 q)2 \u2212 m2\n\n\f5\nwhich factors into the product of two transverse integrations of the form seen previously in the field theory\ncalculation, i.e. Eq. 15. Adding in coupling constants\nand the appropriate numerical factors leads to agreement\nwith the field theory result for the leading structure of\nthis loop amplitude.\nRegion 2 (and symmetrically in Region 3) does not contribute to the leading approximation. The longitudinal\nmomentum does not decouple from the propagator and\nthere is no factor of ln s which develops. Even ignoring\nthe propagator factors we would have\n\u221a\ns\n\ndk1+\n+\n\u221a\n\u03b7 s k1\n= \u2212 ln \u03b7\n\nI1 =\n\nZ\n\n(34)\n\nThis contains no factor of ln s.\nIn Region 4, the delta function constraint cannot be\nsatisfied since \u03b7 2 s >> (k21\u22a5 \u2212 k22\u22a5 ).\nThe strong ordering generalizes to the general ladder\ndiagram, Fig. 2. For all of the cut lines to be on-shell\nrequires\n+\n+\n+\n+\np+\n1 > k1 > k2 > ..... > kn > p2 = 0\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\np2 > kn > ..... > k2 > k1 > p\u2212\n1 = 0\n\n(35)\n\nHowever again the main contribution comes from the\nstrong ordered regions\n+\n+\n+\n+\np+\n1 >> k1 >> k2 > ..... >> kn >> p2 = 0\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\np\u2212\n2 >> kn >> ..... >> k2 >> k1 >> p1 = 0 (36)\n\nThis notion of strong ordering is perhaps the key feature of the Regge kinematic regime. The main effect is\nto allow an approximation to the scattering amplitude.\nIf one considers the general denominator of the propagator which is displayed in the first line of Eq. 31, we\nsee that the form that gets exponentiated in the Regge\nsum arises only when the longitudinal product k + k \u2212 can\nbe neglected in comparison to the transverse momentum.\nThis is only in the strongly ordered region. This yields\nfurther simplifications in the overall momentum integration. Because regions 2 and 3 do not contribute to the\nleading ln(s) enhancement, one is free to approximate the\npropagators by dropping the longitudinal momenta as in\nthe second line of Eq. 31 in these regions. The propagators than have the factored form of Eq. 15, and the\nfull integration then can be done simply. In the example\nabove, the key result of the strong ordering is to allow\nthe propagators to be approximated by their transverse\ncomponents only, as in Eq. 15, 33.\n4.\n\nTHE HIERARCHY OF ORDERED\nCOLLINEAR GLUONS\n\nWithin SCET, the ladder diagrams become a true\nmulti-scale problem. The strong ordering condition\n\nmeans that there is a continuum of scales from the largest\nscale s down to the smallest scale t. Let us label the\nmagnitude of the strong ordering by the factor \u03b7, i.e.\n+\n\u2212\nki+1\n\u223c \u03b7ki+ and ki\u22121\n\u223c \u03b7ki\u2212 . There is no unique value of\n\u03b7 that one must use. Since, as explained above, the primary use of strong ordering is to allow an approximation\n+\nto the amplitude, for example to neglect ki+1\ncompared\n+\nto ki , the value of \u03b7 is related to the accuracy of the\nRegge result. Certainly \u03b7 = 1/10 allows an accurate approximation, while \u03b7 = 1/3 is not as good. Additionally,\nsince the momentum in the legs is integrated over, even\nwithin one diagram there is not a fixed value of \u03b7. However, we will use this parameter as an indicator that the\ndominant contributions come from regions which obey\nthe strong ordering condition. Presumably the fact that\nthe Regge region of high energy scattering begins at c.m.\nenergies somewhat above 1 GeV is related to the condition that s has to be far enough above the average t so\nthat the ladder approximation - with many rungs due to\nthe strong ordering - is valid.\nFor a concrete realization of what is implied by the\nstrong ordering condition,\nlet us look at an extreme ex\u221a\nample. Let us take s = 105 in GeV units and consider\na 11 rung diagram. If we have momentum ordered by a\nfixed factor of \u03b7 = 1/10, then the momenta of the legs\nof the ladder (labeled by ki ) have the following ordering\n(still in GeV units):\np1\nk1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nk5\nk6\nk7\nk8\nk9\nk10\np2\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n105 n\n104 n + 10\u22125 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n103 n + 10\u22124 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n102 n + 10\u22123 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n101 n + 10\u22122 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n100 n + 10\u22121 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n10\u22121 n + 100 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n10\u22122 n + 101 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n10\u22123 n + 102 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n10\u22124 n + 103 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n10\u22125 n + 104 n\u0304 + k\u22a5\n105 n\u0304\n\n(37)\n\nThe rungs of the ladder satisfy ri = ki \u2212 ki+1 . In this\nexample, we see a transition from right-moving collinear\ngluons near the top rung to left-moving particles near\nthe bottom. Each is dominatingly transverse since ki2 =\n\u2212k2\u22a5 + 10\u22121 GeV. There are two legs (k5,6 ) that are considered in the Glauber regime, in which the transverse\nmomentum is the largest component and both longitudinal momenta are sub-dominant. It is such a leg that\nallows the connection of the right-moving particles in the\nupper portion of the diagram with the left-moving branch\nin the lower portion. Of course, this example is incomplete since the ki\u00b1 momenta are really integrated over\nrather than being in a fixed ratio. However it does illustrate an essential feature of strong ordering - there is a\ntransition of right-collinear through at least one Glauber\n\n\f6\nleg to left-collinear within any given ladder diagram.\nThe physical interpretation of this is that we have a series of ordered and nearly collinear emissions. The rungs\nof the latter can be taken to be on-shell, but the general\nlinear momenta is still high such that the collinear pinch\nis applicable. The vertical legs of the ladder are off-shell\nby order t/s, but also carry a high linear momentum\nalong the n or n\u0304 direction. The legs near the top of the\nladder are dominantly right-moving, those near the bottom are dominantly left-moving. Somewhere in the chain\nthere is a Glauber leg connecting these. The whole ordered set of diagrams sums to produce an net effect that\nis equivalent to a Glauber or Coulomb exchange.\nWhen we reformulate this process in the language of\nSCET we encounter a difficulty with the multiple scales.\nIn standard SCET ordering one considers a small parameter \u03bb and orders the effective field theory in powers of\n\u03bb. Here, however, we have at least two small\np parameters. We can take one of these to be \u03bb \u223c \u2212t/s which\nis treated as an extremely small parameter in the Regge\nlimit. The other is what we have called \u03b7 above, i.e. the\nstrong ordering parameter. This parameter is independent of s, t and clearly \u03b7 >> \u03bb \u2248 0 in the Regge region.\nIf we consider a vertex along one of the legs of a rightmoving legs neat the top of a ladder diagram, the relevant\nordering of the momenta is\n\u221a\nki = si (1, 0, 0)\n\u221a\nki+1 = si (\u03b7, \u223c 0, \u03bb)\nri = ki \u2212 ki+1 \u223c ki + O(\u03bb)\n(38)\np\nwith \u03bb \u223c \u2212t/si , \u03bb << \u03b7 << 1 and si \u223c O(\u03b7 i s) >>\n\u039b2QCD . In words, we would label particle ri as being\ncollinear to ki . Because of the two small parameters,\nparticle ki+1 does not have a standard name in SCET.\nWe can give it a name of \"ordered collinear\" to imply\nthat it shares the directions of the original gluon, yet is\nat a parameterically smaller momentum. That is:\n\u221a\np2 \u223c s\u03bb2\nordered collinear \u21d2\np \u223c s(\u03b7, \u03bb2 , \u03bb),\n(39)\nwith \u03bb << \u03b7 << 1. When one has a whole ladder of such\nvertices, one has a highly multiscale problem. If the exchange particles are treated as regular collinear particles,\nthe ordered region is at an endpoint of the integration\nover the longitudinal momentum, but properties derived\nfor collinear particles in general will not be appropriate\nfor this endpoint. In particular, a treatment of general\ncollinear particles will miss the Regge kinematic region\nunless care is taken to properly treat the strongly ordered\nregion and also to include the potential for a Glauber exchange connecting left-movers and right-movers.\n\nEven though most of the particles in the ladder diagram are of the ordered collinear variety, the net effect\nof a Reggeon exchange falls in the Glauber or Coulombic\nkinematic regime.\n\n[1] R.

Eden, \"Regge Poles And Elementary Particles,\"\n\n5.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe application of Regge ideas to QCD has become\nan extensive subfield. The main results are that there\nappears a Reggeon with the quantum numbers of the\ngluon - the Reggeized gluon[6, 7, 8] - as well as a hard\nPomeron[10] with vacuum quantum numbers. The Reggized gluon is not just the \"dressing\" of a gluon, but is\nactually built out of two gluon exchange in a spin-one\ncolor octet channel. The hard Pomeron is then built out\nof the exchange of two Reggeized gluons, and is a color\nsinglet object.\nThe power-law behavior of Regge scattering has the\npossibility to influence the phenomenology of high energy\nprocesses. An example that already exists in the literature is the work by DGPS[26] on final state interactions in\nB meson decay. In this work, the region of soft final state\ninteraction was shown to be of order 1/m2B ; however, the\nexchange of a soft Pomeron provides a scattering amplitude which grows as s1.04 \u223c (m2B )1.04 which removes the\nnominal suppression. While this study was phenomenological in nature and invoked the soft Pomeron, it provides the archetype for how Regge phenomena can modify the power counting of perturbative calculations[27].\nTo proceed further, one should calculate directly with\nthe Reggeized gluon and the hard Pomeron. However,\nthe matching of these degrees of freedom with the usual\ngluons is non-trivial, and we hope to report on this\nmatching in a future publication. This should allow one\nto place the usual hard Regge phenomenology on a better\nfooting as well as to complete SCET through the inclusion of the Regge region. The matching to soft Regge\nphysics is more difficult and it is not clear that this can\nbe accomplished within SCET.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported in part by the U.S. National\nScience Foundation through grant PHY- 055304.
