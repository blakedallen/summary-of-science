In this scenario, our world is assumed to be realized on topological\nobjects like domain walls or brane-junctions. Investigating the quantum fluctuation of the domain\nwall, it was found that zero modes are localized on the wall [4] and the low energy theory\nbecomes a theory on the wall. In other words, domain wall background gives rise to some kind\nof the dimensional reduction as an alternative to the standard Kaluza-Klein compactification [5].\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) can also be implemented in these models, and it is actually a powerful\ndevice for constructing their topological solutions. In SUSY theories, these often appear as the\nBPS states [6] which spontaneously break half of the original SUSY [7]. Therefore, they are\ncalled\n\n1\n2\n\nBPS ones [8]. Viewing the four-dimensional world as a domain wall, we are led to deal\n\nwith SUSY theories in five dimensions. The minimal possibility is N = 1, d = 5 SUSY possessing\n\neight supercharges.\n\nSUSY with eight supercharges is very restrictive. For instance, in theories involving only massless scalar multiplets (hypermultiplets), non-trivial interactions can only arise from nonlinearities\nin kinetic terms. Prior to studying the genuine five-dimensional theories with hypermultiplets, it\nis instructive to start with similar SUSY theories in four dimensions, i.e., N = 2, d = 4 theories.\n\nActually, in N = 1, d = 5 and N = 2, d = 4 theories, the hypermultiplets contain the same\nnumber of on-shell components, viz., two complex scalars and one Dirac fermion. This analysis\n\nof the four-dimensional theory could then be of help in studying the brane world scenarios based\non SUSY theories in higher dimensions [9, 10].\nWith regard to rigid N = 2 SUSY the target manifold of the hypermultiplet d = 4 sigma\n\nmodels must be hyper-K\u00e4hler (HK) [11]. In these theories, the scalar potential can be obtained\nonly if the hypermultiplets acquire masses by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism [12] because of\nthe appearance of central charges in the N = 2 Poincar\u00e9 superalgebra [13]. The form of the\npotential is specified by the norm of the Killing vector of the target manifold isometry whose\n\ngenerator is identified with the central charge [14] (actually, in Ref. [14], the massive HK model\non an arbitrary toric HK manifold was given in the component formalism in four-dimensional\n\n1\n\n\fspace-time). In Ref. [15], the parallel domain walls solution for the massive T \u2217 CP N \u22121 HK sigma\nmodel was found and its moduli space was constructed. In the same model, dynamics of the\ndomain wall solutions was also studied [16] and the calculation of a number of zero modes was\nperformed [17], using the index theorem. In Ref. [18], a massive nonlinear sigma model with\nthe T \u2217 CP 1 target was studied in the N = 1 and N = 2 superfield approaches and its domain\n\nwall solutions were examined. In [19], the massive T \u2217 CP N \u22121 HK model was extended to a\nmassive nonlinear HK model with the cotangent bundle over complex Grassmann manifold as\nthe target space and to some generalization of the latter. The structure of vacua in these models\nwas examined. The lump and Q-lump solutions in the HK nonlinear sigma models were also\nconsidered in [20, 21, 22, 23]. All models of this type can be called massive nonlinear HK sigma\nmodels.\nSome massive nonlinear sigma models were studied in an on-shell approach, i.e., by taking\naccount of physical fields only [14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23]. On the other hand, more appropriate for\nsuch a study is an off-shell formalism. It provides a powerful tool of constructing models with\nthe domain wall and brane-junction solutions [24], as well as a low-energy effective action around\nthe wall [25].\nThe most natural description of N = 2, d = 4 SUSY field theories is achieved in the harmonic\n\nsuperspace (HSS) [26]. The HSS approach is the only one to allow superfield formulations\nof N = 2 SUSY theories with all supersymmetries being manifest and off-shell. In the HSS\n\napproach, any HK nonlinear sigma model can be described by one analytic function which is the\nHK analog of K\u00e4hler potential. This analytic function (HK potential) embodies self-interactions\nof hypermultiplets. The massless nonlinear sigma models in the HSS formalism were studied in\n[27, 28, 29]. In particular, in [29], it was shown that the component action obtained from the\ngeneral massless nonlinear sigma model in HSS coincides with that given in [11, 30]. Central\nextensions of the nonlinear sigma model with the Taub-NUT (TN) [31] and Eguchi-Hanson (EH)\nmetrics [32] and corresponding mass and scalar potential terms were examined in Refs. [33, 34].\nThe domain wall solutions in T \u2217 CP 1 were also studied in the harmonic superspace framework,\nalong with the study in N = 1 superfield formalism in [18].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to investigate N = 2 massive nonlinear sigma models\n\nin the HSS approach. We limit ourselves to the case of sigma models associated with four2\n\n\fdimensional HK multi-center metrics, because everything is drastically simplified in this case.\nThe component action (both its kinetic and potential parts) can be written in terms of the single\nanalytic HK potential. The resulting scalar component potential turns out to coincide with that\nin [14]. The general form of the BPS equation is derived in the multi-center case. As examples we\nconsider sigma models associated with the TN metric and its generalization, the so called double\nTaub-NUT (DTN) metric (see e.g. [35]). The latter encompasses both the TN and EH metrics\nas its two limiting cases. We demonstrate that only in the DTN and EH cases BPS domain wall\nsolutions exist. The condition of the existence of SUSY vacua comes out as some restriction on\nthe analytic HK potential, similarly to the N = 1 case where there arise analogous restrictions\n\non the superpotential and K\u00e4hler potential. This criterion might be useful in constructing other\nN = 2 models with domain wall solutions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 contains a brief review of the general massive\n\nnonlinear sigma models in N = 1 theory. Sec. 3 is devoted to the N = 2 SUSY massive\n\nnonlinear sigma model in the HSS approach. We start in subsection 3.1 by recalling basic features\nof massless N = 2 sigma models. The general massive sigma model with at least one isometry\n\nis studied in the subsection 3.2. In the subsection 3.3, we study the massive sigma model with\nU(1) isometry and multi-center HK target manifolds. We show, in this new HSS setting, that\n\nthe scalar potential is expressed through the norm of the Killing vector. We also study there\ntwo particular cases with U(1) isometry. Sec. 4 is devoted to a criterion which the analytic HK\npotential should satisfy to admit SUSY vacua and to a BPS equation and its solution. The\nsummary and concluding remarks are contained in Sec. 5. In Appendices A and B, we derive\nthe relation between the Killing vectors in harmonic and ordinary spaces, as well as the scalar\npotential of the massive sigma model with one isometry.

We find that there are two cases when the SUSY vacuum exists in such a\nnonlinear sigma model, namely, if\n1. there is a stationary point of the superpotential, such that the K\u00e4hler metric is not vanishing\nat this point\n\u2202W\n= 0,\n\u2202A\n\nand gAA\u2217 6= 0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ng AA 6= \u221e ,\n\u2217\n\n(2.9)\n\n2. there is a singularity of the K\u00e4hler metric, such that the derivative of the superpotential is\nnot singular at this point\ngAA\u2217 = \u221e\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ng AA = 0 ,\n\u2217\n\nand\n\n\u2202W\n6= \u221e.\n\u2202A\n\n(2.10)\n\nNote that the vanishing of F term (F i = 0) is neither necessary nor sufficient for SUSY to\nbe unbroken in the nonlinear sigma model, since the K\u00e4hler metric in eq. (2.8) can possess zeros\nand/or singularities.\nNext, let us consider the BPS equation. In the following we examine only the bosonic part\nsince we are now interested in the non-trivial bosonic configuration. The BPS equation can be\nderived from the energy minimum condition. Assuming that there exists a non-trivial configuration along the spatial y axis, the energy of the general nonlinear sigma model (per unit area) is\nexpressed as\nE =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217j\n\ni\n\ndx2 gij \u2217 \u22022 A \u22022 A +\n\n\u2217 \u2202W\ng ij\n\u2202Ai\n\n\u2202W \u2217\n\u2202A\u2217j\n5\n\n!\n\n\f=\n\nZ\n\n\u2265 2\n\n(\n\ni\n\ni\u03b4 ik \u2217\n\ndx2 gij \u2217 \u22022 A \u2212 e g\n\nZ\n\n\u2202W \u2217\n\u2202A\u2217k\n\n!\n\n\u2217j\n\n\u22022 A \u2212\n\n\u2217 \u2202W\ne\u2212i\u03b4 g lj\n\u2202Al\n\ndx2 \u22022 Re(e\u2212i\u03b4 W),\n\n!\n\n\u2212i\u03b4\n\n+ 2\u22022 Re(e\n\nW)\n\n)\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is a phase factor. If we impose the most restrictive bound, a phase of the superpotential\ncan be taken as\n\u03b4 = arg(W(y = \u221e) \u2212 W(y = \u2212\u221e)).\n\n(2.12)\n\nWhen the bound is satisfied, the following equation must hold\n\u22022 Ai = ei\u03b4 g ij\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2202W \u2217\n\u2202A\u2217j\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere both sides are evaluated at classical fields. This equation is called the BPS equation, and\nwe thus find that the BPS equation involves both the K\u00e4hler potential and the superpotential.\nSo the existence of non-trivial solutions to the BPS equation is encoded in the structure of these\nentities.\nThis formulation is useful when we are interested in massive nonlinear sigma models having\ndomain wall solutions. To possess a domain wall solution, the theory should have at least two\ndiscrete vacua. The conditions (2.9) and (2.10) can then be used to set up such a model. For\ninstance, in Ref. [24], the model corresponding to the choice gAA\u2217 \u2261 KAA\u2217 = 1/|1 \u2212 A2 | was\ngiven as a simple example. Once the model is specified, one can easily obtain the domain wall\nsolution using (2.13).\n\n3\n\nGeneral massive nonlinear sigma model in the harmonic\nsuperspace\n\nFirst, we study the general massive nonlinear sigma model with at least one triholomorphic (i.e.,\ncommuting with supersymmetry) U(1) isometry. The presence of such an isometry is necessary\nif one wishes to gain the mass (and/or scalar potential) terms. We shall not specify how this\nisometry is realized. Next we examine the particular case of the four-dimensional target HK\nspace. In this case, requiring the theory to have an U(1) isometry implies that the corresponding\n6\n\n\fHK metric falls into the multi-center class [35]. As was shown in [35], using some coordinate\ntransformation, this U(1) isometry can always be cast in the form in which it is realized as some\nphase or purely shift transformation of the coordinates of the HK manifold. For this case we\nshall demonstrate that the scalar potential is given by the square of the isometry Killing vector,\nin accord with the result of [14].\n\n3.1\n\nHK sigma model in HSS: the general massless case\n\nFirst, we consider the action of the general massless nonlinear sigma model in the HSS approach.\nThe HSS action for a general nonlinear N = 2, d = 4 supersymmetric sigma model which\n\nyields in the bosonic sector a sigma model with 4n dimensional HK target space is just the general\nsuperfield action of n hypermultiplets. In the HSS formalism, the hypermultiplet is described by\nan analytic superfield qa+ (a = 1, . . . , n is a flavor index of fundamental representation of Sp(n))\nwhich is a function given on the harmonic analytic N = 2 superspace\n\u03bc\n+\ni +\n+\ni +\n\u00b1\n\u03bc\n(i \u03bc j) + \u2212\n{\u03b6A , u\u00b1\ni } \u2261 {xA = x \u2212 2i\u03b8 \u03c3 \u03b8\u0304 u(i uj) , \u03b8 = \u03b8 ui , \u03b8\u0304 = \u03b8\u0304 ui , ui },\n\nwhere the coordinates u+i , u\u2212i , u+i u\u2212\ni = 1, i = 1, 2\n\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nare the SU(2)R /U(1) harmonic variables\n\n[26, 29].\nExploiting the target space reparameterization covariance, the general action can be cast in\nthe form [29]\n1\nS=\n2\n(\u22124)\n\nwhere d\u03b6A\n\nZ\n\n(\u22124)\n\nd\u03b6A\n\nh\n\ni\n\ndu qa+ D ++ q a+ + L+4 (qa+ , u\u00b1\ni ) ,\n\n(3.2)\n\ndu = d4 xA d2 \u03b8+ d2 \u03b8\u0304+ du is the measure of integration over analytic superspace (3.1),\n\nD ++ is the harmonic covariant derivative defined as\nD ++ = \u2202 ++ \u2212 2i\u03b8+ \u03c3 \u03bc \u03b8\u0304+ \u2202\u03bc , \u2202 ++ = u+i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202u\u2212i\n\n(3.3)\n\n+\nand L+4 (qa+ , u\u00b1\ni ) is the analytic HK potential.

(3.7) - (3.9)\nonly in the limit when all fermions are discarded, which amounts to the reduction q + \u2192 F + .\nFrom now on, we neglect all fermionic fields and deal with the bosonic component action.\nBoth fermionic and bosonic components in (3.4) contain infinite sets of auxiliary fields coming\nfrom the harmonic expansions. In order to obtain the action in terms of 4n physical bosonic fields\nonly, we should eliminate the relevant auxiliary fields by solving their algebraic (i.e., kinematical)\nequations of motion. Therefore, as the basic steps towards the final sigma model action we should\nsingle out the kinematical part of the equations of motion following from (3.2) (with all fermions\nbeing discarded) and solve these equations.\n3\n\nIn general, (3.2) is not obliged to respect any extra symmetry except for N = 2 SUSY.\n\n8\n\n\fSubstituting the bosonic part of Grassmann expansion (3.4) into the action (3.2), and integrating over Grassmann coordinates, we obtain the bosonic action in the form\nSbos =\n\nZ\n\n(\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n\u03bc +\nD ++ \u03b4ab \u2212 \u2202a+ \u2202c+ \u03a9cb L+4 A\u2212\u03bc\nb \u2212 4\u2202 Fa\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013)\n\u0012\n1\n1\n++ +\n\u2212\na(\u22123)\ncb +4\n+4\n++ b\na\u2212\nD Fa \u2212 \u2202a+ L\nNb \u2212 P\n.

Equation of motion for Fa+ is\n1\nD ++ Fa+ (x, u) \u2212 \u2202a+ L+4 (F, u) = 0 .\n2\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere D ++ coincides with a partial harmonic derivative \u2202 ++ which acts on the harmonic arguments\nof the component fields as well as on the harmonics appearing explicitly. We denote the harmonic\nderivative in (3.11) by D ++ in order to distinguish it, e.g., from the partial derivative in (3.9)\nwhich acts only on the explicit harmonics in \u039b++ (F, u) and not on the harmonic arguments of\nF = F (x, u). We reserve the notation \u2202 ++ just for this latter derivative.\nThe derivative D ++ , when applied to an arbitrary scalar function G(F, u), yields:\n1\nD ++ G = \u2202 ++ G + D ++ F a+ \u2202a+ G = \u2202 ++ G + \u03a9ab \u2202b+ L+4 \u2202a+ G ,\n2\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere we used eq.

(3.11), (3.14) and (3.15) back into (3.10), the action is drastically\nsimplified\nSbos =\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\nd4 xA du \u2212 Aa\u2212\n\u2202 \u03bc Fa+ .\n2 \u03bc\n9\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fNote that the harmonic fields Fa+ and A\u2212\na\u03bc are still subject to the constraints (3.11) and (3.14)\nand they include infinite sets of auxiliary fields. Solving eq. (3.11), one can express Fa+ (xA , u) as\nFa+ = Fa+ (f ai , u) where f ai (x) are the standard HK target space coordinates. We shall refer to\nf a\u00b1 = f ai (x)u\u00b1\ni\n\n(3.17)\n\nas the \"central basis\" HK coordinates and to F a+ and F a\u2212 related by\nD ++ F a\u2212 = F a+\n\n(3.18)\n\nas the \"analytic basis\" HK coordinates [38, 29]. A more detailed explanation of this nomenclature\ncan be found in [38, 29]. Given the solution Fa+ = Fa+ (f ai , u), the field A\u2212\na\u03bc can be expressed\n\u2212\nai\nfrom (3.14) as A\u2212\na\u03bc = Aa\u03bc (f , u) . Substituting these solutions into the action results in the final\n\nsigma model action for f ai (x).\nIn solving eqs. (3.11), (3.14) and (3.15), it is convenient to make use of the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the HK sigma models and the geometric construction of HK manifold\nin the harmonic space [38, 29]. In the latter formulation, the standard constraints of the HK\ngeometry are interpreted as the conditions of harmonic analyticity. This allows one to solve\ndefining constraints of the HK geometry in terms of two unconstrained analytic potentials one of\nwhich proves to be pure gauge. The remaining potential encodes all the information about the\ngiven HK manifold, in the sense that all the relevant geometric objects, i.e., connections, vielbeins\nand metric, can be expressed in terms of this potential. We call this geometric approach the nonLagrangian one, in contrast to the Lagrangian approach to which we adhere in this paper and\nin which the metric and other geometric quantities of HK geometry appear in the N = 2, d = 4\n\nsupersymmetric sigma model type action as the result of solving equations of motion for an\ninfinite tower of auxiliary fields contained in q a+ . As was shown in [38, 29], both approaches are\nin fact equivalent to each other. In particular, the unconstrained potential in the non-Lagrangian\napproach corresponds to the analytic HK potential in N = 2 nonlinear sigma model. Using the\n\none-to-one correspondence between these two approaches, as well as the differential geometry\ntechniques of Refs. [38, 29], it is easy to check that the solution of eqs. (3.14) and (3.15) is\na\u2212\nbi\nAa\u2212\n\u03bc = 2Ebi \u2202\u03bc f ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nMa\u2212 = Na\u2212 = 0,\n\n(3.20)\n\n10\n\n\fwhere Ebia\u2212 is one of the two central basis vielbeins Ebia\u00b1 from which the HK metric is constructed.\nThey satisfy the relations [29]\nD ++ Ebia+ = 0 ,\n\nEbia+ = \u2212D ++ Ebia\u2212 = \u2212\u2202bi F a+ ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhich can be deduced based upon eq. (3.11) (for instance, the first one is proved by applying\n\u2202/\u2202f bi to (3.11)). Substituting (3.19) and (3.20) into (3.16), we obtain\nSbos =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 xA gai,bj (xA ) \u2202 \u03bc f ai \u2202\u03bc f bj ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere gai,bj is the HK target space metric defined by\nc\u2212 d+\nc+ d\u2212\ngai,bj = \u03a9cd (Eai\nEbj \u2212 Eai\nEbj ).\n\n(3.23)\n\nIt is easy to show that this metric is u independent, gai,bj = gai,bj (xA ). This can be checked\nutilizing eq. (3.21), keeping in mind that the Sp(n) connections drop out altogether due to the\ncontraction of the Sp(n) indices.\nWe briefly sketch the basic steps leading from the action (3.16) to the final action (3.22).\nFirstly, we use in (3.16) the relation\na+\n\u2202 \u03bc F a+ = \u2202 \u03bc f ck \u2202ck F a+ = \u2212\u2202 \u03bc f ck Eck\n,\n\nafter which the integrand in (3.16) is reduced to\nd+\n\u03a9ad Ebia\u2212 Eck\n\u2202\u03bc f bi \u2202 \u03bc f ck .\n\nThen we take into account that the second piece in (3.23) is reduced to the first one under the\nu-integral: one should use eq. (3.21), take into account that the Sp(n) connections drop out\ndue to the contractions of the Sp(n) indices, and finally integrate by parts with respect to D ++ .\nAfter these manipulations the last expression is reduced, modulo a total harmonic derivative,\njust to the metric term in (3.22).\nTo close the discussion of the massless nonlinear sigma model, we collect some useful formulas\nrelated to the U(1) isometry (3.7) projected on the bosonic sector. The basic HSS Killing potential\nequation (3.9) on the surface of the kinematic equation (3.11) amounts to the 'conservation law':\nD ++ \u039b++ (F, u) = 0 .\n11\n\n(3.24)\n\n\fIn the central basis, eq. (3.24) implies\n+\n\u039b++ (f, u) = \u039bik (f )u+\ni uk .\n\n(3.25)\n\nUsing (3.24) and (3.13), it is also easy to find\nD ++ \u03bba+ (F, u) = 0 .\n\n(3.26)\n\nFrom eqs. (3.7) - (3.9) and also using (3.25), we find the following central basis form of (3.7)\n1\n+\na+ ck\na+ ck\nk (f ) = \u2212\u03b5 Eck\nk .\n\u03b4F a+ = \u03b5 \u03bba+ (F, u) = \u03b5 \u03a9ab \u2202b+ f ck \u2202ck \u039bij (f )u+\ni uj = \u03b5 \u2202ck F\n2\n\n(3.27)\n\nHere k ck (f ) is the ordinary Killing vector,\n\u03b4f ck = \u03b5 k ck (f ) .\n\n(3.28)\n\nThe identity (3.27) allows one to find the explicit expression for k ai (f ) in terms of the central\nbasis Killing potential \u039b(ij) (f ) (see Appendix A).\n\n3.2\n\nGeneral massive HK sigma model in HSS\n\nNext we consider the general massive deformation of the HSS q + Lagrangian. Suppose we are\ngiven a q + action possessing an isometry. Then we assign to q + a dependence on the central\ncharge coordinate x5 , such that \u2202/\u2202x5 can be identified with the Killing vector of the isometry\n\u2202 a+\nq = m \u03bba+ (q, u)\n\u2202x5\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere m is a mass parameter which, for simplicity, is taken to be real. Correspondingly, the\nharmonic covariant derivative (3.3) acquires the central charge term [39]:\nD ++\n\n\u2192\n\nh\n\nD ++ + i (\u03b8+ )2 \u2212 (\u03b8\u0304+ )2\n\ni\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202x5\n\n(3.30)\n\nand the action (3.2) is modified as\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n(\u22124)\n\nd\u03b6A\n\n\u0010\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u0011\n\ndu qa+ D ++ q a+ + L+4 (q, u) + im (\u03b8+ )2 \u2212 (\u03b8\u0304+ )2 qa+ \u03bba+ .\n\n12\n\n(3.31)\n\n\fSimilarly to the massless case, substituting the Grassmann expansion of the harmonic superfield\n(3.4) with suppressed fermions into (3.31), we obtain the bosonic action in the following form\nZ\n\n\u0011\n1 a\u2212 \u0010 ++b \u2212\u03bc\n\u2212\nA\u03bc D a Ab \u2212 4\u2202 \u03bc Fa+ \u2212 M a\u2212 D ++b\na Nb\n4\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n++ +\na(\u22123)\na\u2212\n+ b+\na\u2212\n+ b+\n+4\nD Fa \u2212 \u2202a+ L\n\u2212 P\n+ im(N \u2202a+ (Fb \u03bb ) \u2212 M \u2202a+ (Fb \u03bb )) .(3.32)\n2\n\nSbos =\n\nd4 xA du\n\nThe corresponding equations of motion read\nD ++ Ma\u2212 \u2212 im \u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ ) = 0 ,\n\n(3.33)\n\nD ++ Na\u2212 + im \u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ ) = 0 ,\n\n(3.34)\n\nalong with (3.11) and (3.14). It is worth emphasizing that the equations of motion for Ma\u2212 and\nNa\u2212 are modified as compared to (3.15) due to the mass deformation, while the equations (3.11)\nand (3.14) for Fa+ and A\u2212\na\u03bc are not modified. As in the massless case, these equations serve to\nexpress infinite sets of auxiliary fields collected in the involved quantities in terms of the central\nbasis HK coordinate f ai (x) and its x-derivative.\nAfter substituting these kinematical equations of motion into (3.32), the bosonic component\naction acquires the simple form\nSbos =\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nim\n1\n\u03bc +\n(M a\u2212 \u2212 N a\u2212 )\u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ ) .\nd4 xA du \u2212 Aa\u2212\n\u03bc \u2202 Fa \u2212\n2\n2\n\n(3.35)\n\nThe harmonic fields in (3.35) are still solutions of (3.11), (3.14), (3.33) and (3.34). Since we have\nalready solved the equations (3.11) and (3.14) while studying the massless case, the remaining\nequations to be solved are (3.33) and (3.34). Here we present the general form of the solution\nfor M a\u2212 , N a\u2212 (some details of the derivation are given in Appendix B):\nh\n\n\u0010\n\na b+\nM a\u2212 = \u2212N a\u2212 = im Fb\u2212 \u2202+\n\u03bb + k ci \u2202ci F a\u2212 \u2212 2 Ecia\u2212\n\nHere Fa\u2212 is defined by\n\ni\u0011\n\n.\n\n(3.36)\n\n1\nFa+ = D ++ Fa\u2212 = D ++ Fa\u2212 \u2212 \u2202a+ \u2202b+ L+4 F b\u2212 .\n2\n\n(3.37)\n\nSubstituting (3.19) and (3.36) into (3.35), we obtain,\nSbos = Skin + Spot =\nV (f ai ) = m2\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 xA gai,bj (xA ) \u2202 \u03bc f ai \u2202\u03bc f bj \u2212\nh\n\nZ\n\nd4 xA V (f ai ),\n\n(3.38)\n\ni\n\n(3.39)\n\ndu \u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ )\u03a9ad Fe\u2212 \u2202d+ \u03bbe+ + k ci (\u2202ci Fd\u2212 \u2212 2\u03a9de Ecie\u2212 ) .\n13\n\n\fThe kinetic sigma model term in (3.38) has the same form as the massless bosonic action (3.22).\nNote that the potential in the generic case still displays a harmonic dependence while the kinetic\nterm does not depend on the harmonic variables. The genuine scalar potential in x-space is\nobtained after performing the integration over harmonics. In Appendix B, we give the sufficient\ncondition under which this integration can be explicitly performed.\n\n3.3\n\nMassive HK sigma model in HSS: a multi-center case\n\nIn the previous subsection we derived the component action of the general massive HK nonlinear\nsigma model with at least one triholomorphic isometry. We did not specify the precise realization\nof this isometry. We obtained the kinetic term of the nonlinear sigma model which has exactly\nthe form prescribed in Refs. [36, 11]. However, in the general case the harmonic integral in the\nscalar potential cannot be computed in a simple way. Fortunately, in the case of four-dimensional\nHK manifolds the situation is simplified radically due to the theorem [40, 35] claiming that any\n4-dimensional HK metric with at least one U(1) triholomorphic isometry falls into the class of\nGibbons-Hawking multi-center metrics [41]. Moreover, it can be shown (see [29] and refs. therein)\n+4 +\n+\nthat the HK potentials for such metrics can always be brought to the form L+4\nmc = L (u * q , u)\n\nwhere u+ * q + = u+a qa+ and the isometry is realized as the shift q +a \u2192 q +a + \u03b5 u+a. As a result,\nthe computation of the potential is drastically simplified.\nIn the present case we have\n\u03bba+ = u+a ,\n\n\u2202 a+\nq = m u+a .\n5\n\u2202x\n\n(3.40)\n\nIn this particular case, the Lagrangian in (3.35) can be rewritten as follows\nL = Lkin + Lpot ,\nZ\n1\n\u03bc +\nLkin = \u2212\nduAa\u2212\n\u03bc \u2202 Fa ,\n2 Z\nLpot = \u2212im\n\nduM a\u2212 u+\na,\n\n(3.41)\n(3.42)\n(3.43)\n\nwhere we used Ma\u2212 = \u2212Na\u2212 , which follows from (3.33) and (3.34).\nOur purpose is to derive the component action of physical bosons in x-space from the (x, u)space action (3.41). One of the ways to obtain it is to substitute (3.40) into the general formula\n14\n\n\f(3.38). However, it is easier to proceed directly by solving eqs. (3.11), (3.14), (3.33) and (3.34).\nWe carry out this in two steps. First, we solve the equations of motion (3.11) and (3.14), and\nderive the kinetic term. As a result of solving these equations, Fa+ and A\u03bc\u2212\na are expressed in terms\nof the dynamical physical fields f ai . It turns out that it is actually enough to solve equation for\n+\nA\u03bc\u2212\na partially, as distinct from the equation for Fa which should be solved exactly. Secondly, we\n\nsolve the equations (3.33) and (3.34). These solutions are needed to derive the scalar potential.\nWe will see that the scalar potential is expressed in terms of the analytic HK potential after\nsubstituting the solutions into (3.43).\nThe equations of motion (3.11) and (3.14) are written in the considered particular case as\n+2\nD ++ Fa+ \u2212 u+\n= 0,\naL\n\n(3.44)\n\n+ +\n\u03bc\u2212\nD ++ A\u03bc\u2212\n) \u2212 2\u2202 \u03bc Fa+ = 0 ,\na \u2212 ua (u * A\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere\n1 \u2202L+4\n,\n2 \u2202(u+ * F + )\n1 \u2202 2 L+4\n.\nL(u+ * F + , u) = \u2212\n2 \u2202(u+ * F + )2\n\nL+2 (u+ * F + , u) = \u2212\n\n(3.46)\n\nFirst we solve (3.44). Substituting the following ansatz\na+\nF a+ = f ai u+\n(f ai , u)\ni +v\n\n(3.47)\n\n\u2202 ++ v a+ (f ai , u) = u+a L+2 .\n\n(3.48)\n\ninto (3.44), we obtain\n\nUp to a gauge freedom, v a+ (f ) can be written as\nv a+ (f ai , u) = u+a v(f ai , u).\n\n(3.49)\n\n+\nai\n+a i +\nu+ F + = u+a (fa i u+\ni + ua v(f , u)) = u fa ui .\n\n(3.50)\n\nIndeed,\n\nThus, eq. (3.48) amounts to\n\u2202 ++ v(f ai , u) = L+2 (u+ * f + , u).\n15\n\n(3.51)\n\n\fUsing the harmonic Green function [29], we obtain the general solution of this equation as\nai\n\nv(f , u) =\n\nZ\n\ndw\n\nu+ * w \u2212 +2 + +\nL (w * f , w) .\nu+ * w +\n\n(3.52)\n\nTo be convinced that this is indeed a solution, one should substitute it into (3.51) and use\nu+ * w \u2212\nu+ * w +\n\n\u2202u++\n\n!\n\n= \u03b4 (2,\u22122) (u, w).\n\n(3.53)\n\nThus, we find the final form of the solution of (3.44) to be\nF\n\na+\n\n=\n\nf ai u+\ni\n\n+u\n\n+a\n\nZ\n\ndw\n\nu+ * w \u2212 +2 + +\nL (w * f , w)\nu+ * w +\n\n(3.54)\n\nwhich will be used for computing the kinetic term.\n\u2212\nNext, we partially solve eq. (3.45). Multiplying (3.45) by u+\na and ua , we obtain\n\nD ++ (u+ * \u00c3\u2212\n\u03bc) = 0,\n\n(3.55)\n\n+\n\u2212\n+a\ni \u2212\nai\nD ++ (u\u2212 * \u00c3\u2212\n\u03bc ) \u2212 (u * \u00c3\u03bc )(1 \u2212 L) + 2u \u2202\u03bc fa ui L + 2\u2202\u03bc v(f , u) = 0 ,\n\n(3.56)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc\u2212\n\u03bc i \u2212\n\u00c3\u03bc\u2212\na = Aa \u2212 2\u2202 fa ui .\n\n(3.57)\n\nEq. (3.55) implies that B \u03bc (x) \u2261 (u+ * \u00c3\u03bc\u2212 ) does not depend on the harmonics. Substituting this\n\ninto (3.56) and taking the harmonic integral of the l.h.s. of (3.56), we find\nB \u03bc (x) = \u2212\n\n2\n\u2202 \u03bc f ai Vai ,\n1 + V0\n\n(3.58)\n\nwhere\nVai =\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\n+\n+\ndu u+\na ui L(u * f , u),\n\nV0 = \u01ebai Vai = \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndu L(u+ * f + , u).\n\n(3.59)\n(3.60)\n\nHere, we have used the property\nZ\n\ndu v(f, u) =\n\nZ\n\ndudw\n\nu+ * w \u2212 +2 + +\nL (w * f , w) = 0 ,\nu+ * w +\n\n(3.61)\n\n+\n++ \u2212\nwhich can be proved by representing u+\ni in the numerator of the integrand as ui = \u2202u ui ,\n\nintegrating by parts with respect to \u2202u++ and using the properties\n(u\u2212 * w \u2212 ) \u03b4 (1,\u22121) (u, w) = 0\n16\n\n\fand\nZ\n\ndu \u2202 ++ f (q) (u) = 0\n\nwhere q is a U(1) charge. From (3.57) and (3.58), we obtain\nA\u2212\n\u03bca\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212\nu+\na (u\n\n*\n\nA\u2212\n\u03bc)\n\n+\n\n2 u\u2212\na\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03bc f bj u+\nb uj\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc f bj Vbj\n+\n1 + V0\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.62)\n\nNow we are ready to compute the kinetic term. As already mentioned, in order to compute\nthe metric, there is no need to explicitly solve eq. (3.56) for the remaining unknown (u\u2212 * A\u2212\n\u03bc) =\n\nai \u2212 \u2212\n(u\u2212 * \u00c3\u2212\n\u03bc ) \u2212 2\u2202\u03bc f ua ui . We substitute (3.54) and (3.62) into (3.42) and, integrating by parts\n\nwith respect to D ++ , obtain\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u03bc +\nduAa\u2212\n= \u2212\n\u03bc \u2202 Fa\n2\n\u001a\nZ\n1\n\u03bc ai + \u2212\n=\ndu D ++ (u\u2212 * A\u2212\n\u03bc )\u2202 f u(a ui)\n2\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\u001b\n1\nai\n\u03bc bj \u2212 +\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u2202\nf\nV\n\u2202\nf\nu\nu\n+\n\u2202\nv\n.\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bc f ai u+\nu\n+\n\u03bc\nai\nb j\na i\n1 + V0\n\nLkin\n\n(3.63)\n\nAt this step, eq. (3.56) must be taken into account. We make use of it in the first term on the\nr.h.s. of (3.63), then perform the harmonic integral, integrate a few times by parts and use eqs.\n(3.61) and (3.51). Finally, we obtain the kinetic sigma model term just in the form (3.22) with\ngai,bj = (1 + V0 )\u01ebab \u01ebij + Vai \u01ebbj + Vbj \u01ebai +\n\n2\nVai Vbj .\n1 + V0\n\n(3.64)\n\nThe same metric has been earlier derived from the HSS approach in [38, 29]. There, the nonLagrangian approach was used, with the inverse metric as the basic outcome:\ng ai,bj =\n\n1\n(\u01ebab \u01ebij + V ai \u01ebbj + V bj \u01ebai + V 2 \u01ebai \u01ebbj )\n1 + V0\n\n(3.65)\n\nwhere V 2 = V ai Vai . The Lagrangian approach used above is simpler and more direct. It can be\neasily employed to find the explicit form of the scalar potential term in (3.38) for the considered\nmulti-center metrics.\nTo this end, we should still solve eqs. (3.33) and (3.34) which in this particular case have the\nfollowing form\nD ++ Ma\u2212 + im u+\na = 0,\n\n(3.66)\n\nD ++ Na\u2212 \u2212 im u+\na = 0.\n\n(3.67)\n\n17\n\n\fThus eqs. (3.66) and (3.67) are reduced to the single equation\n+\n\u2212\n+\nD ++ Ma\u2212 \u2212 u+\na (u * M ) L + im ua = 0 .\n\n(3.68)\n\nIntroducing\nM\u0303 a\u2212 = M a\u2212 + im u\u2212a\n\n(3.69)\n\n\u2212\nand projecting (3.68) on the harmonics u+\na and ua , respectively, we obtain\n\nD ++ (u+ * M\u0303 \u2212 ) = 0 ,\n\n(3.70)\n\nD ++ (u\u2212 * M\u0303 \u2212 ) \u2212 (u+ * M\u0303 \u2212 ) (1 \u2212 L) \u2212 imL = 0 .\n\n(3.71)\n\nIt follows from (3.70) that (u+ * M\u0303 \u2212 ) does not depend on harmonics,\n(u+ * M\u0303 \u2212 ) = A(x) .\n\n(3.72)\n\nSubstituting this into (3.71) and integrating the l.h.s. of the latter over harmonics, we obtain\nA(x) = im\n\nV0\n1 + V0\n\n\u21d2\n\n(u+ M \u2212 ) = A \u2212 im = \u2212im\n\n1\n.\n1 + V0\n\n(3.73)\n\nSubstituting (3.73) into (3.43), we find the final form of the scalar potential to be\nLpot (x, u) = \u2212m2\n\n1\n,\n1 + V0\n\n\u2202 ++ Lpot = 0 .\n\n(3.74)\n\nThus, we have managed to solve the equations of motion (3.11), (3.14), (3.33) and (3.34) and\nso have found the explicit form of the component bosonic action (3.38) for the multi-center case.\nBoth the HK metric and potential term in (3.38) are expressed, by eqs. (3.64) and (3.74), in\nterms of the single object, multi-center potential V0 defined in (3.60).\nLet us derive the same result (3.74) in another way. Applying the general formula (3.27) to\nthe particular case (3.40) and taking into account that it follows from eq. (3.54) that \u03b4f ai =\n\u03b5 \u01ebai \u21d2 k ai = \u01ebai , we find\nu+a = \u2212Ebia+ k bi = \u2212Ebia+ \u01ebbi = D ++ Ebia\u2212 \u01ebbi .\n\n(3.75)\n\nThen we can rewrite the Lagrangian (3.43) as\nLpot = \u2212im M a\u2212 \u03a9ac Ebic + \u01ebbi .\n18\n\n(3.76)\n\n\fMoreover, it is easy to find\nM a\u2212 = \u2212im Ebia\u2212 \u01ebbi .\n\n(3.77)\n\nNow we substitute this into (3.76), use the definition (3.23) and take into account eq. (3.21) and\nthe fact that under the u-integral one can integrate by parts. As the result we obtain\nLpot = \u2212\n\nm2\nm2\ngai,bk \u01ebai \u01ebbk = \u2212\ngai,bk k ai k bk ,\n2\n2\n\n(3.78)\n\nwhich is just the square of the norm of Killing vector k ai = \u01ebai . Using (3.64), we find\ngai,bk \u01ebai \u01ebbk =\n\n2\n,\n1 + V0\n\n(3.79)\n\ni.e., we come back to the expression (3.74). This means that the scalar potential is determined by\nthe norm of the Killing vector. This fact was originally obtained in [14] by means of an on-shell\nformalism.\nFinally, let us show that eqs. (3.64) and (3.74) can be put in the standard multi-center form.\nIntroducing,\ni\nV~ = \u2212 (~\u03c4 )ai Vai ,\n2\n\n~ = \u221ai (~\u03c4 )ai fai ,\nX\n2\n\n1\n\u03c6 = \u221a \u01ebai f ai ,\n2\n\nU = 1 + V0 ,\n\n(3.80)\n\nwhere ~\u03c4 ai are the Pauli matrices,4 we can write down Lagrangian (3.41) in the form\no\n1n\n~ * \u2202\u03bcX\n~ + U \u22121 D\u03bc \u03c6D \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m2 U \u22121 ,\n(3.81)\nU\u2202\u03bc X\n2\n\u221a\n~ = (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ), \u03c6 are real scalar fields, and\nwhere m has been changed by m/ 2, and X\n~ The fields V~ and 1 + V0 , by their definition, satisfy the differential\nD\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + V~ * \u2202\u03bc X.\n\nL=\n\nequations\n\n~ \u00d7 V~ = \u2207U,\n~\n\u2207\n\n\u2206U = 0,\n\n\u2202\n(1 + V0 ) = 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(3.82)\n\nThe scalar potential is given by\nV = m2 U \u22121 .\n4\n\nHere ~\u03c4 ai = \u01ebab~\u03c4b i where ~\u03c4ai are the standard Pauli matrices.\n\n19\n\n(3.83)\n\n\fThis precisely coincides with what has been found in [14]. In this parameterization, the U(1)\nisometry (3.40) is realized as a shift of the coordinate \u03c6 of the HK manifold:\n\u03b4\u03c6 =\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03b5,\n\n~ = 0.\n\u03b4X\n\n(3.84)\n\nNote that it is possible to extend the above consideration to the case of 4n dimensional HK\nmanifolds whose metric have n commuting translation isometries, i.e., to the general case of toric\n+4 +i +\nHK metrics. In this case, the ansatz for the analytic HK potential is L+4\ntoric = L (u qai , u) where\n\na = 1, * * * n [29].\nNow we consider two particular examples.\ni) Taub-NUT case\nThe analytic potential in the Taub-NUT (TN) case can be chosen as\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f62\n\n2 ++ 2\n2\nL++ \u2212 c++\n+\n+\n\uf8f8 ,\nq\nL+4\n(g ) = \uf8ed\nT N (u * q , u) =\n\u03bb\n\u03bb 1 + 1 + (L++ \u2212 c++ )c\u2212\u2212\n\n5\n\nL++ = u+ * q + ,\n\n(3.85)\n\n\u00b1\n1 ij\n2\nwhere c\u00b1\u00b1 = cij u\u00b1\ni uj , c = 2 c cij = 1 and \u03bb is a constant.

The relevant analytic HK potential\nreads\nL++\n+\n+\n\u221a\nL+4\n(u\n*\nq\n,\nu)\n=\n2\nDT N\n1 + 1 + L++ \u03b7 \u2212\u2212\n\u2212(1 \u2212 a)(L++ )2 ,\n\n!2\n\n2\n+\n\u03b3\n\nL++\n\u221a\n1 + 1 \u2212 L++ \u03b7 \u2212\u2212\n\n!2\n\n(3.92)\n\n\u00b1\nik\nwhere a and \u03b3 are some constants and \u03b7 \u00b1\u00b1 = \u03b7 ik u\u00b1\ni ui . If \u03b7 = 0 we return to the TN case. For\n\n\u03b7 ik 6= 0, one can always choose \u03b7 2 = 12 \u03b7 ij \u03b7ij = 1 by the appropriate rescaling of q a+ . As we will\nsee, \u03b7 ij specifies the location of the centers. The potential V0 in the present case reads\n1\nV0 =\n2\n\nZ\n\ndu\n\n1\n[1 + L++ \u03b7 \u2212\u2212 ]3/2\n\n1\n1\n+\n++\n\u03b3 [1 \u2212 L \u03b7 \u2212\u2212 ]3/2\n\n!\n\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 a) ,\n\n(3.93)\n\nwhence\n1\n1\n1\n1\nq\n+\u221a\n.\nUDT N = 1 + V0 = a + \u221a q\n2 (Lik + \u03b7 ik )(Lik + \u03b7ik )\n2 \u03b3 (Lik \u2212 \u03b7 ik )(Lik \u2212 \u03b7ik )\n\n(3.94)\n\nIntroducing,\n\ni\n\u03be~ = \u221a ~\u03c4 ij \u03b7ij ,\n2\n\n(3.95)\n\nand using (3.90), we can rewrite (3.94) as\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\u221a\n.\nUDT N = a + \u221a\n~\n~\n~ + \u03be|\n~ \u2212 \u03be|\n2 |X\n2 \u03b3 |X\n21\n\n(3.96)\n\n\fFor a 6= 0 this is a two-center ALE potential, with the constant vector \u03be~ specifying the position\n\nof both centers (they are collinear to each other). For a = 0, the potential UDT N becomes the\ngeneral EH potential with non-equal \"masses\". Like the DTN potential itself, its EH limiting\ncase possesses only U(1)\u00d7U(1) isometry in contrast to the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) isometry of the standard\nEH potential which is recovered under the choice \u03b3 = 1.\n\n4\n\nStructure of SUSY vacua and the BPS equation\n\nFrom the form of the scalar potential (3.74) we can find the SUSY vacuum condition which is\nsimilar to that in the N = 1 case. The condition of SUSY vacuum is the vanishing of the scalar\npotential\n\nm2\n= gai,bj k ai k bj .\n0 = V (f ) =\n1 + V0\nai\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe find that in our parameterization of the multi-center case the SUSY vacuum exists, provided\nthere is a point where the potential V0 goes to infinity,\n1\nV0 =\n2\n\nZ\n\ndu\n\n\u2202 2 L+4\n\u2192 \u221e.\n\u2202(L++ )2\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe condition (4.2) is the N = 2 multi-center counterpart of the general SUSY vacuum conditions\n\n(2.9) and (2.10) of the N = 1 theory. We expect that this condition imposes strong restrictions on\nthe original HK potential L+4 , though for the time being we do not know them in full generality.\n\nNow we apply eq. (4.2) to the previous examples.\ni) TN case\nIn the TN case, it follows from (3.91) that the condition (4.2) can be realized only for the\n~ = 0. Thus the theory has only one SUSY vacuum. As a consequence,\nvacuum expectation value X\nno domain wall solution can be found in this case since the existence of the domain wall solutions\nrequires that the theory has at least two vacua.\nii) DTN case\nIn the DTN case, the theory has two discrete vacua which are realized at vacuum expectation\n~ Indeed, in this case there exists the domain wall solution as we shall\n~ = \u2212\u03be~ and X\n~ = \u03be.\nvalues X\n\nsee soon.\n\n22\n\n\fV\n0.4\n0.2\n0 3\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n2\n\nr\n\n\u0398\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n(a) 3D Plot of the potential.\n\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n\n\u03b3 = 0.2\n\u03b3 = 1.0\n\u03b3 = 1.8\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\na = 2.5\n\na = 1.0\n\nV\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n\u0398\n\n(b) Plot of the potential along \u0398 axis.\n\nFigure 1: Plots of the potential for \u03be = 1.0 and m = 1.0.\n\nIn order to find the behaviour of the potential in the DTN case, we take \u03be~ = (0, 0, \u03be) and\nintroduce the spherical coordinates such as\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nX = r sin \u0398 cos \u03a8, X = r sin \u0398 sin \u03a8,\n\nX =\n\nq\n\nr 2 + \u03be 2 cos \u0398,\n\n\u03c6 = \u03a6 + \u03a8.\n\n(4.3)\n\nIn this parameterization, the geometrical meaning of the target manifold becomes clear: the\nfields r and \u0398 are the coordinates of base manifold S 2 and \u03a6 and \u03a8 form a fiber over this base\nmanifold. The DTN potential (3.96) takes the following form in the coordinates (4.3):\nUDT N\n\n1\n=a+ \u221a\n2\n\n!\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a 2\n+ \u221a 2\n.\n2\n2\n| r + \u03be + \u03be cos \u0398| \u03b3 | r + \u03be \u2212 \u03be cos \u0398|\n\n(4.4)\n\nNote that the potential (4.4) depends only on the real coordinates r and \u0398, and not on \u03a6 and\n\u03a8, which reflects the presence of U(1) \u00d7 U(1) isometry. So the vacuum configurations \"live\" on\n\nthe submanifold S 2 of the full target space.\n\nThe behaviour of the scalar potential in the spherical reparameterization for different ranges\nof the involved parameters is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1-(a) shows the 3D plot of the scalar potential.\nIt is seen that there are two discrete vacua at (r, \u0398) = (0, 0) and (0, \u03c0). Fig. 1-(b) shows the plot\nof the potential along \u0398 axis for some values of a and \u03b3. For \u03b3 = 1 the shape of the potential\nis symmetric with respect to \u0398 = \u03c0/2 axis. As the value of \u03b3 deviates from \u03b3 = 1, the scalar\npotential becomes asymmetric. If \u03b3 goes to infinity, the vacuum is realized only at the single\n23\n\n\fpoint (r, \u0398) = (0, 0) since the third term in eq. (3.96) disappears and the potential (3.96) reduces\nto the one of the TN case (with an arbitrary constant a). As a increases, the behaviour becomes\ngentle, i.e., the value of the potential at any value of \u0398 excepting vacua decreases.\n~ = 0 in the TN case, can be easily cast in\nThe vacuum expectation values, for instance, X\nthe HSS language using (3.90); these amount to L++ = 0 in the TN case and to L++ = \u2212\u03b7 ++\n\nand L++ = \u03b7 ++ in the DTN case. For these special values of L++ , the analytic potentials (3.85)\nand (3.92), equally as their second derivatives entering (3.86) and (3.93), acquire singularities\n\u2212\nat some points of the harmonic sphere S 2 \u223c {u+\ni , uk }. As the result, the u-integral (4.2) which\n\nspecifies the sufficient condition for vacuum to be the SUSY one becomes divergent. E.g., in the\nTN case, substituting L++ = 0 (Lij = 0) into (4.2), one obtains harmonic integral\nV0\n\nLij =0\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\ndu\n\n1\n[1 \u2212 c++ c\u2212\u2212 ]3/2\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhich is divergent. The same divergent integrals are obtained in the DTN case for two values of\nL++ , namely for L++ = \u2212\u03b7 ++ and L++ = \u03b7 ++ . The existence of two discrete vacua in the latter\ncase guarantees the existence of the domain wall solution.\n\nIn the following, we consider the general BPS equation and apply it to the DTN case. If we\nassume that there is a non-trivial configuration along the spatial y direction and this configuration\nis static, the energy density can be written as\n1\n~ * \u22022 X\n~ + 1 U \u22121 D2 \u03c6D2 \u03c6 + 1 m2 U \u22121\nU\u22022 X\n2\n2\n2\n1\n~ \u2212 mU \u22121~n) * (\u22022 X\n~ \u2212 mU \u22121~n) + \u22022 X\n~ * ~n + 1 U \u22121 D2 \u03c6D2 \u03c6\nU(\u22022 X\n=\n2\n2\n~\n\u2265 \u22022 X * ~n,\n\nE =\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere ~n is a unit vector.

(4.9) can be easily solved by\n\u03c6 = const, X 1 = const, X 2 = const.\n\n(4.11)\n\nWithout loss of generality, these constants can be put equal to zero, i.e., \u03c6 = X 1 = X 2 = 0.\nUsing these solutions and substituting (3.96) into (4.10), we bring eq.

Fig. 2 shows the profiles of the domain wall solutions. Fig.\n2-(a) shows the profiles for some values of \u03b3 with a = 1. For \u03b3 = 1, the metric becomes the DTN\nmetric with equal masses and the scalar configuration is symmetric at the center of the wall for\ny = 0. In particular, for \u03b3 = 1 and a = 0 (the standard EH case), analytic solution is obtained\nas\nX = \u03be tanh\n\n\u221a\n\n!\n\n2m\n(y + y0 ) ,\n2\u03be\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere y0 is an integration constant which specifies the position of the wall. As \u03b3 deviates from\nthe value \u03b3 = 1, the scalar configuration becomes asymmetric. For fixed \u03b3, the behaviour of the\nsolution is shown in Fig. 2-(b). As was mentioned, when \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the metric approaches the TN\n\nmetric and therefore the domain wall solution does not exist in this limit.\n25\n\n\f5\n\nSummary and concluding remarks\n\nIn this paper we have studied N = 2 massive nonlinear sigma model starting from the action in\n\nthe off-shell HSS formulation which manifests the full N = 2 SUSY. The scalar potential was\nobtained by assigning to q + a dependence on the central charge coordinate x5 , such that \u2202/\u2202x5\n\nis identified with the Killing vector of the isometry. The component bosonic action was obtained\nbased on the one-to-one correspondence between the Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian approaches\nto the HK geometry. As was shown in [29], the kinetic term at the component level in the general\nnonlinear sigma model is composed of the vielbeins and has a form which is independent of the\nharmonic variables. On the other hand, the scalar potential in the general case of one isometry\nstill involves an integration over harmonics. Its more preferable form, which does not contain\nthe harmonic integral, is derived in the Appendix B. It is shown there that the integration over\nharmonic variables can be explicitly performed under the particular condition which is satisfied,\ne.g., in the multi-center case.\nMassive nonlinear sigma models with multi-center metrics were examined. In the generic HK\ncase, solving the kinematical part of the equations of motion is very difficult problem. However,\nin the multi-center case, the situation is much simpler. We solved the kinematical part of the\nequations of motion and obtained the physical component action where integration over harmonic\nvariables was performed to the end. It was shown that both the target metric and the scalar\npotential can be expressed in terms of the single analytic HK potential. The scalar potential\nwas found to be fully specified by the norm of the Killing vector, which is in agreement with the\nearlier derivation of Ref. [14]. Given the explicit form of the scalar potential, we discussed the\nSUSY vacuum condition. The SUSY vacuum condition was related to the analytic HK potential.\nThis result is the N = 2 extension of the similar condition in N = 1 theory which involves the\n\nK\u00e4hler potential and the superpotential. We derived BPS equation in the general multi-center\ncase and BPS domain wall solution was obtained for the DTN case.\nWe would like to conclude by mentioning some directions for future work.\n\nIt would be interesting to extend our discussion of the multi-center four-dimensional case to\nthe general case of toric HK manifolds, i.e., 4n dimensional HK manifolds with n commuting\ntriholomorphic isometries.\n26\n\n\fIn this paper, we studied the nonlinear sigma model without explicit use of the quotient\nconstruction, starting from the given HK potential L+4 (q, u) (though both the TN and DTN\nHK potentials can actually be deduced from the appropriate HSS version of the quotient construction, see [28, 44, 45]). It is interesting to discuss the massive nonlinear sigma model with\nisometries like the models we considered here within the quotient construction. We expect essential simplifications in this regard. In particular, the quotient method could make easier coupling\nof the massive nonlinear sigma model to the supergravity, which is also an interesting task. In\nthis case, instead of HK sigma models we would have sigma models with quaternion-K\u00e4hler (QK)\ntarget manifolds [46]. The HSS formulation of the N = 2, d = 4 supergravity and massless QK\nsigma models in the supergravity background was worked out in Refs. [47, 48, 44]. It would be\ntempting to extend it to the case of massive QK sigma models.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe collaboration with M. Naganuma, M. Nitta and N. Sakai motivated M.A. to start this\nwork.

Firstly, we multiply both sides of the relation in\n(3.27),\n1\n+\na+ ck\n\u03bba+ = \u2212Eck\nk = \u03a9ab \u2202b+ f ci \u2202ci \u039bkl u+\nk ul ,\n2\n27\n\n(A.1)\n\n\fa+\nby Ea\u2212dk which is the inverse to the vielbein Edk\n. Then we use the representation [38]\n\nEb\u2212ci = \u2212\u2202b+ f ci + Eb\u2212d\u2212 \u2202d\u2212 f ci ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere \u2202d\u2212 = \u2202/\u2202F d\u2212 is the derivative with respect to the non-analytic coordinate F d\u2212 defined in\n(3.18), and the precise form of Eb\u2212d\u2212 is of no interest for our purpose. Due to the analyticity of\n\u039b++ , i.e. the property \u2202d\u2212 \u039b++ = 0, the result of multiplication of (3.27) by Ea\u2212dk can be written\nas\nEa\u2212dk Ebia+ k bi =\n\n1 ab \u2212dk \u2212ci\n+\n\u03a9 Ea Eb \u2202ci \u039bln u+\nl un .\n2\n\n(A.3)\n\nNext we make use of eq. (3.21) and the relations\nEa\u2212dk Ebia+ + Ea+dk Ebia\u2212 = \u03b4bd \u03b4ik ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nEa+dk = \u2212D ++ Ea\u2212dk .\n\n(A.5)\n\nAfter that, integrating both sides of (A.3) over harmonics with making use of (A.4), (A.5) and\n(3.21) and taking into account that the Sp(n) connections drop out altogether because all Sp(n)\nindices are contracted, we obtain\nk ai =\n\nZ\n\n+\ndu \u03a9cd(Ec\u2212ai Ed\u2212bj ) \u2202bj \u039bkl u+\nk ul .\n\n(A.6)\n\nUsing the definition of the triplet of complex structures\n[ai,bj] \u00b1k \u00b1l\n\nI \u00b1\u00b1[ai,bj] = Ikl\n\nu u\n\n= Ec\u00b1ai Ed\u00b1bj \u03a9cd\n\n(A.7)\n\nand performing the harmonic integration in (A.6), we obtain the final relation\n1 [ai,bj]\nk ai = \u2212 I(kl) \u2202bj \u039b(kl) (f ) .\n3\n\nB\n\n(A.8)\n\nThe scalar potential with arbitrary U (1) isometry\n\nIn this appendix, we solve the kinematical equations of motion (3.33) and (3.34). First of all, in\norder to solve them, we prove the following relation\n\u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ ) = \u2202a+ D ++ (Fb\u2212 \u03bbb+ ) = D ++ \u2202a+ (Fb\u2212 \u03bbb+ ) + (\u2202a\u2212 Fb\u2212 )\u03bbb+\n28\n\n(B.1)\n\n\fwhere Fa\u2212 was defined in eq. (3.37). The first equality can be proved by using the definition\n(3.26) and (3.37). In order to prove the second equality, one should firstly take into account\nthat Fb\u2212 \u03bbb+ is not analytic since Fb\u2212 is not analytic, Fb\u2212 = Fb\u2212 (F + , F \u2212 , u). We shall also need\nthe property that the harmonic covariant derivative D ++ includes the derivative \u2202d\u2212 = \u2202/\u2202F d\u2212\n\nwhen acting on non-analytic objects [38, 29]\n\n1\nD ++ Ga (F + , F \u2212 ) = D ++ Ga + F d+ \u2202d\u2212 Ga \u2212 \u2202a+ \u2202b+ L+4 Gb .\n2\n\n(B.2)\n\nUsing (B.2), as well as the relations \u2202a\u2212 F b+ = 0 and \u2202a+ F b+ = \u03b4ab , we can prove the second\nequality.\nIntroducing \u03bba\u2212 by\n\u03bba+ = D ++ \u03bba\u2212 ,\n\n\u03b4F a\u2212 = \u03b5 \u03bba\u2212 ,\n\n(B.3)\n\n1\n\u2202[a+ Fb]\u2212 \u2261 (\u2202a+ Fb\u2212 \u2212 \u2202b+ Fa\u2212 ),\n2\n\n(B.4)\n\nand using the relation\nD ++ \u2202[a+ Fb]\u2212 = \u2212\u03a9ab + \u2202[b\u2212 Fa]\u2212 ,\nit is straightforward to transform (B.1) to\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ ) = D ++ Fb\u2212 \u2202a+ \u03bbb+ + \u03bbb+ \u2202b+ Fa\u2212 + \u03bbb\u2212 \u2202b\u2212 Fa\u2212 \u2212 2\u03bb+\na ,\n\n(B.5)\n\nwhence the solution to eqs. (3.33) and (3.34) is obtained as follows\n\u0010\n\na b+\nM a\u2212 = \u2212N a\u2212 = im Fb\u2212 \u2202+\n\u03bb + \u03bbb+ \u2202b+ F a\u2212 + \u03bbb\u2212 \u2202b\u2212 F a\u2212 \u2212 2 Ecia\u2212 k ci\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\na b+\n= im Fb\u2212 \u2202+\n\u03bb + k ci \u2202ci F a\u2212 \u2212 2 Ecia\u2212\n\ni\u0011\n\n.\n\n\u0011\n\n(B.6)\n\nIn passing from (B.5) to the first line in (B.6) we used eqs. (A.1) and (A.5). Now we can\nsubstitute the solution (B.6) in (3.35) and obtain the general form of the scalar potential (3.39).\nAnother, perhaps more convenient representation for the scalar potential can be obtained as\nfollows. Using the Sp(n) bridge Mba , M ab Mbc = \u03a9ac , one redefines\nNa\u2212 = Mab N\u0302b\u2212 , Ea\u2212bi = Mad \u00cad\u2212bi , (D ++ )ac Mcb = 0 , D ++ \u00cad\u2212bi = \u00cad+bi , D ++ \u00cad+bi = 0 ,\n\n(B.7)\n\nand rewrites the equation for Na\u2212 as\nD ++ N\u0302a\u2212 = im \u00caa\u2212bi \u2202bi (Fc+ \u03bbc+ ) .\n29\n\n(B.8)\n\n\fThe last equation is solved by\nN\u0302a\u2212 = im\n\nZ\n\ndw\n\n(u+\n\n1\n\u00ca \u2212bi \u2202bi (Fc+ \u03bbc+ ) .\n* w+) a\n\n(B.9)\n\nSubstituting this into (3.35), we obtain the following form of the scalar potential\nim Z\ndu(M a\u2212 \u2212 N a\u2212 )\u2202a+ (Fb+ \u03bbb+ )\n2Z\n1\n= m2 dudw \u03a9ab \u00caa\u2212di \u2202di (Fc+ \u03bbc+ ) + + \u00cab\u2212ek \u2202ek (Ff+ \u03bbf + ) ,\n(u * w )\n\nLpot = \u2212\n\n(B.10)\n\nwhere the first and second multipliers are evaluated at the harmonic arguments u and w, respectively. Using the fact that the bridges drop out under the Sp(n) covariant contractions and the\nproperty that the vielbeins with \"hat\" are linear in the appropriate harmonics, one can rewrite\n(B.10) as\n[ai,bk]\n\nLpot = m2 I(st)\n\n(st)\n\nF[ai,bk] \u2212\n\nm2 ai,bk\ng\nFai,bk ,\n2\n\n(B.11)\n\nwhere\n\n(st)\n\nF[ai,bk]\n\nZ\n\n(u\u2212 * w \u2212 )\n\u2202bk (Ff+ \u03bbf + ) ,\n(u+ * w + )\nZ\nu\u2212(s w \u2212t)\n= dudw \u2202ai (Fc+ \u03bbc+ ) + + \u2202bk (Ff+ \u03bbf + ) .\n(u * w )\n\nFai,bk =\n\ndudw \u2202ai (Fc+ \u03bbc+ )\n\n(B.12)\n\nHowever, it is unclear for us whether these harmonic integrals can be manifestly computed in\nthe general case. Only in the particular case, when\n1\n(Fa+ \u03bba+ ) = \u2212 (F a+ \u2202a+ )\u039b++ = g\u039b++ ,\n2\n\n(B.13)\n\nwith g being a constant, these integrals can be computed in terms of \u2202ai \u039b(kl) (using the fact that\n\u039b++ is bilinear in harmonics in the central basis), although we do not quote here the precise\nformulas. Note that this condition is trivially satisfied for the isometry (3.40).\n\nReferences\n[1] P. Horava and E. Witten, Nucl. Phys. B460 (1996) 506, [hep-th/9510209].\n\n30\n\n\f[2] N. Arkani-Hamed, S.
