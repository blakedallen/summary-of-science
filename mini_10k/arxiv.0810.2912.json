When energy levels cross or avoided cross as parameters of\na Hamiltonian vary, various interesting phenomena happen. For example, if two instantaneous energy levels of a time-dependent Hamiltonian are avoided crossing, the non-adiabatic\ntunneling called the Landau-Zener tunneling between them takes place [1]. Closely related\nto this, the runtime of adiabatic quantum computation is inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the energy gap between the ground and first exited levels [2]. An eigenstate encircling adiabatically degeneracy points accumulates a Berry phase in addition to a dynamical\nphase [3, 4]. In quantum chemistry, a conical intersection of electronic energy surfaces of\nmolecules plays a key role in understanding ultrafast radiationless reactions [5, 6]. A quantum phase transition, a dramatic change in a ground state as parameters of a system vary,\nis related with crossings or avoided crossings of two lowest energy levels [7]. Kais et al. have\nshown that the finite size scaling method can be used for studying the critical behavior, i.e.,\nthe level degeneracy or absorption, of a few-body quantum Hamiltonian H(\u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbk ) as a\nfunction of a set of parameters {\u03bbi } [8, 9]. These parameters could be the external fields,\ninter-atomic distances, nuclear charges for stability of negative ions, cluster size, and optical\nlattice parameters such as the potential depth [10]. Thus, it is important to develop a way\nof finding level crossings and to understand how eigenstates or relevant physical quantities\nchange at crossing or avoided crossings.\nRecently Bhattacharya and Raman presented a powerful algebraic method for finding\nlevel crossings without solving an eigenvalue problem directly [11]. Along with this mathematical way, it is necessary to understand what physical quantities can be used to detect\nor characterize crossings or avoided crossings. First of all, the measurement of a Berry\nphase could be a good way to detect level crossings because it due to level crossings. It\nis well known that avoided crossings or glancing intersections are not the source of Berry\nphases [5]. Is there any way that Berry phases can detect avoided level crossings ? Here we\nshow that the marginal Berry phase of an entangled state could be an indicator to avoided\nlevel crossings.\nThe entropy is an another indicator to level crossings. Since level crossing or avoided\ncrossings are accompanied with a drastic change in eigenstates, any contents of information\n2\n\n\fon relevant eigenstates may also vary. The Shannon entropy of the electron density measures\nthe delocalization or the lack of structure in the respective distribution. Thus the Shannon\nentropy is maximal for uniform distribution, that is, for an unbound system, and is minimal\nwhen the uncertainty about the structure of the distribution is minimal [12]. Gonz\u00e1lez-F\u00e9rez\nand Dehesa showed that the Shannon entropy could be used as an indicator of avoided crossings [13]. The von Neumann entropy, the quantum version of the Shannon entropy, is a good\nentanglement measure for a bipartite pure state. In quantum information, much attention\nhas been paid to the relation between entanglement and quantum phase transitions [14, 15].\nRecently one of the authors investigated the relation between entanglement, Berry phases,\nand level crossings for two qubits with the XY-type interaction and found that the level\ncrossing is not alway accompanied with the abrupt change in entanglement [16].\nIn this paper, in order to study how entanglement and Berry phases vary at level crossings,\nwe consider the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian describing a hyperfine interaction of electron and\nnuclear spins in a uniform magnetic field [17]. It is shown that the von Neumann entropy of\nthe electron (or nuclear) spin is maximum at avoided crossings. It is demonstrated that the\nsignificant changes in Berry phases and entanglement are closely related to level crossings.\nWe show that the marginal Berry phase of the electron (or nuclear) spin could be a good\nindicator to avoided level crossings. The marginal Berry phase has nodal points at the\navoided crossing points.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian is introduced.\nIn Sec. III, as a specific application of the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian, we consider a hyperfine\ninteraction between a nuclear spin 1/2 and an electron spin 1/2 of a hydrogen atom in a\nmagnetic field. We analyze the close relation between entanglement, Berry phases, and level\ncrossings. In Sec. IV, we make an similar analysis for a sodium atom with a nuclear spin\n3/2 and an electron spin 1/2. In Sec. V, we summarize the main results.\n\nII.\n\nBREIT-RABI HAMILTONIAN\n\nLet us consider an atom with a single valence electron in the ground state with orbital\nangular momentum L = 0. In the presence of a uniform magnetic field B in the z direction,\nits atomic spectrum is described by the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian [17], which is given by the\nsum of the hyperfine interaction between a nuclear spin I and an electron spin S and their\n3\n\n\fZeeman couplings to the magnetic field\nH = A I*S + (aSz + bIz )B ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A is the hyperfine coupling constant, a = \u03b3e ~, and b = \u03b3n ~. Here \u03b3e and \u03b3n are the\nelectron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios, respectively. The electron spin operator S and\nthe nuclear spin operator I are measured in the unit of ~.\nThe Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian (1) is well studied to describe double resonance in nuclear\nmagnetic resonance [18] and the muon spin rotation in semiconductors [19]. Although simple\nand well understood, it still continues to provide new insights. Recently Bhattacharya and\nRaman found a new class of invariants of the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian [11]. As will be\nshown here, it is a prime example for showing the close relation between level crossings,\nentanglement, and geometric phases. Also it is related to a Hamiltonian of electron spin\nqubits in quantum dots [20] where the Heisenberg interaction between two electron spins\ncan be turned on and off to implement the controlled-not gate.\nBefore applying the Hamiltonian (1) to specific systems, let us look at its general properties. If B = 0, then H commutes with both the square of the total spin operator J2 and Jz ,\nwhere the total spin operator is defined by J \u2261 I + S. However, for B 6= 0, due to the fact\n\nthat a 6= b, the Hamiltonian (1) no longer commutes with J2 , but still commutes with Jz .\n\nSo the eigenvalue m of Jz is a good quantum number for the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian. With\nladder operators, S\u00b1 = Sx \u00b1 iSy and I\u00b1 = Ix \u00b1 iIy , the Hamiltonian (1) can be rewritten as\nH = A I z Sz +\n\nA\n(S+ I\u2212 + S\u2212 I+ ) + B(aSz + bIz ) .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nLet us use a simple notation |mS , mI i to represent the product state |S, mS i \u2297|I, mI i, where\n\n|S, mS i is an eigenstate of S2 and Sz , and |I, mI i is an eigenstate of I2 and Iz . The first and\nthird terms in Eq. (2) give the diagonal matrix elements\nhmS mI | H |mS mI i = f (mS , mI ) = A mS mI + mS aB + mI bB .\n\n(3a)\n\nThe second term in Eq. (2) corresponds to the off-diagonal matrix elements\nhm\u2032S m\u2032I | S+ I\u2212 |mS mI i\np\np\n= (S \u2212 mS )(S + ms + 1) (I + mI )(I \u2212 mI + 1) \u03b4m\u2032S ,mS +1 \u03b4m\u2032I ,mI \u22121 .\n\n(3b)\n\nSince m\u2032S \u2212 mS = 1 and m\u2032I \u2212 mI = \u22121 (or vice versa), one has the selection rule, \u2206m =\n\n(m\u2032S +m\u2032I )\u2212(mS +mI ) = 0, that is, the magnetic quantum number m = mS +mI is conserved.\n4\n\n\fThis implies that the Hamiltonian (1) is block diagonal in the basis set {|mS , mI i} ordered\nby m.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nTHE HYDROGEN ATOM IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD\nEigenvalues and Eigenstates\n\nAs a simple but real system described by the Hamiltonian (1), let us consider the interaction between the nuclear spin I = 1/2 and the electron spin S = 1/2 of a hydrogen atom in a\nuniform magnetic field. Since H commutes with the z-component of the total spin operator,\nJz = Sz + Iz , it is convenient to arrange the product basis {|mS , mI i} in the decreasing\n\b\norder of the magnetic quantum number m of Jz as 21 , 21 , 12 , \u2212 21 , \u2212 12 , 12 , \u2212 21 , \u2212 12 . By\n\nmeans of Eqs. (3), the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom can be written in the\nordered basis\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nA + 2(a + b)B\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\n\u2212A + 2(a \u2212 b)B\n2A\n0\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nH= \uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n4\uf8ec\n0\n2A\n\u2212A\n\u2212\n2(a\n\u2212\nb)B\n0\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\nA \u2212 2(a + b)B\n\n(4)\n\nThe Hamiltonian (4) is block diagonal, so it is straightforward to obtain its eigenvalues\n\b\nand eigenvectors. The subspace of m = \u00b11 is spanned by 21 , 21 , \u2212 21 , \u2212 12 . The block\n\nHamiltonian on this subspace is already diagonal and has its eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nE\u00b11 =\n\nA 1\n\u00b1 (a + b)B ,\n4\n2\n\n|E\u00b11 i = \u00b1 12 , \u00b1 21 ,\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nwhere the subscripts '\u00b11' in E\u00b11 denote the magnetic quantum number m = \u00b11. The block\n\b\nHamiltonian with m = 0 is defined on the subspace of 21 , \u2212 12 , 12 , \u2212 12 and is written as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2A\n1 \u2212A + 2(a \u2212 b)B\n\uf8f8.\nHm=0 = \uf8ed\n(6)\n4\n2A\n\u2212A \u2212 2(a \u2212 b)B\nOne can interpret the Hamiltonian Hm=0 as that of a spin in an effective magnetic field in\nthe x-z plane, Beff \u2261 (A/2, 0, (a \u2212 b)B/2). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hm=0 can\n5\n\n\fbe written easily as\nA 1p\n(a \u2212 b)2 B 2 + A2 ,\n\u00b1\n4\n2\n\u03b1 1 1\n\u03b1\n= cos\n\u2212 21 , 12 ,\n, \u2212 2 + sin\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 1 1\n\u2212 12 , 21 ,\n, \u2212 + cos\n= \u2212 sin\n2 2 2\n2\n\nE0\u00b1 = \u2212\nE0+\nE0\u2212\nwhere tan \u03b1 \u2261\n\nA\n.\n(a\u2212b)B\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n(7c)\n\nIn a weak magnetic field limit (so called the Zeeman region), the\n\nZeeman energy is smaller than the hyperfine coupling. At B = 0, i.e., \u03b1 = \u03c0/2, the ground\n\u0001\neigenstate E0\u2212 becomes the singlet state, E0\u2212 = \u221a12 \u2212 21 , 21 \u2212 12 , \u2212 12 . In a strong\nmagnetic field called the Paschen-Back region, the Zeeman couplings are dominant. That\nis, in limit of B \u2192 \u221e, one has \u03b1 \u2192 0 and E0\u2212 \u2192 \u2212 12 , 12 .\nThe eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom,\nEqs. (5) and (7) depend on two parameters: the hyperfine constant A and the magnetic\nfield B. The hyperfine constant A of the hydrogen atom in vacuum is positive. However,\nif a hydrogen atom is in an inert gas, the hyperfine constant A could be negative [21],\nresembling the spin-spin coupling constant in a Heisenberg model. We assume that A as\nwell as B varies and can be negative. To this end, A in Eqs. (5) and (7) is replaced by f A\nwith \u22121 \u2264 f \u2264 1, so A is still kept the positive constant in vacuum. If f is negative, so the\nhyperfine constant.\nDepending on f and B, the ground state of the Hamiltonian (4) is given either by |E\u00b11 i\n\nor by E0\u2212 . It is convenient to plot the energy levels normalized by A. Then, Eqs. (5)\np\nand (7) become E\u00b11 /A = f4 \u00b1 12 (a\u2032 + b\u2032 )B and E0\u00b1 /A = \u2212 f4 \u00b1 21 (a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032 )2 B 2 + f 2 , where\n\na\u2032 \u2261 a/A \u2248 19.767 T\u22121 and b\u2032 \u2261 b/A \u2248 \u22120.03 T\u22121 are taken form Ref. [22], and B is\nmeasured in the unit of tesla. The energy levels Em /A are plotted as functions of B for\nf = 1 in Fig. 1 (a) and for f = \u22120.5 in Fig. 1 (b). For f \u2265 0, the ground level is E0\u2212 .\n\nFor f < 0, two levels, E0\u00b1 and E\u00b11 , with different magnetic quantum numbers cross at\nf =\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|.\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nFig. 2 (a) shows the energy gap \u2206/A between the ground and first exited\n\nstates as a function of f and B, where we take a\u2032 = 0.1 T\u22121 and b\u2032 = \u22120.01 T\u22121 to see\nclearly the phase diagram of the ground state of the Hamiltonian (4) determined by the\nmagnetic quantum number m. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the energy gap \u2206/A vanishes along\nthe lines defined by f =\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nand the negative f axis. In the region of f <\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|,\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nthe ground state becomes either |E+1 i or |E\u22121 i with the magnetic quantum number m = 1\nor m = \u22121, respectively. On the other hand, the ground state in the region defined by\n6\n\n\ff>\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nis given by E0\u2212 with the magnetic quantum number m = 0. One can see that\n\nthe magnetic quantum number m of the ground state changes abruptly at the level crossing\npoints.\n\nB.\n\nEntanglement\n\nLet us discuss the relation between level crossings and entanglement. Entanglement refers\nto the quantum correlation between subsystems and has no classical analog [23, 24]. When\nlevel crossing happens as the parameter of the Hamiltonian varies, the ground state changes\ndrastically. Entanglement as a physical quantity may also undergo a significant change.\nHowever, entanglement is not always a good indicator to level crossing as shown in Ref. [16].\nFirst, let us examine the relation between entanglement and level crossings for each\neigenstate. The von Neumann entropy S of a subsystem is a good entanglement measure for\na pure bipartite system. If |\u03c8AB i is a quantum state of a system composed of two subsystems\nA and B, the entanglement between A and B is measured by the von Neumann entropy\nof the subsystem, S(\u03c1A ) = \u2212tr(\u03c1A log \u03c1A ) = S(\u03c1B ) = \u2212tr(\u03c1B log \u03c1B ), where the reduced\ndensity matrix \u03c1A of the subsystem A is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of B\nas \u03c1A = trB (|\u03c8AB i h\u03c8AB |). If the ground state is given by |E\u00b11 i, i.e., a product state, then\nthe von Neumann entropy S of the electron (or nuclear) spin is zero. On the other hand,\nfor the quantum state E0\u00b1 of the electron and nuclear spins, the von Neumann entropy of\nthe electron (or nuclear) spin can be written as\nS(\u03c1A ) = \u2212\n\n1 + cos \u03b1 1 \u2212 cos \u03b1\n1 \u2212 cos \u03b1\n1 + cos \u03b1\nlog2\n\u2212\nlog2\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\nFig. 1 (c) shows the von Neumann entropy of the electron (or nuclear) spin for each eigenstate\nas a function of B. For the eigenstates E0\u00b1 , it is maximum at B = 0, i.e., at the avoided\ncrossing point. This is analogous to the sharp change in Shannon entropy at avoided crossing\nin Ref. [13].\nNow, let us look at how entanglement changes at level crossings as the parameters of\nthe Hamiltonian vary. Fig. 2 (b) plots the von Neumann entropy S of the electron (or\nnuclear ) spin for the ground state as a function of f and B. Across the level crossing line,\nf =\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|,\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nthe von Neumann entropy changes abruptly. For f > 0, S becomes 1 as B\n\ngoes to 0. Along the line of f = 0, the von Neumann entropy S vanishes even though there\n7\n\n\fis no level crossing.\n\nC.\n\nBerry Phase\n\nAn instantaneous eigenstate encircling the energy level crossing points acquires the Berry\nphase in addition to the dynamical phase. The information on the level crossings is encoded\nin the Berry phase. At B = 0 and f = 1, the two levels E\u00b11 cross and the other two levels\nE0\u00b1 are avoided crossing. Also E\u00b11 and E0\u2212 cross at f =\n\n2a\u2032 b\u2032\n|B|.\na\u2032 \u2212b\u2032\n\nHere we focus on the\n\nBerry phase due to the level crossing or avoided crossing at B = 0.\nDue to the fact that a \u226b |b|, an electron spin rotates much faster than a nuclear\nspin. We assume the magnetic field B is rotated slowly enough for both the electron\nand nuclear spins to evolve adiabatically. The magnetic field B = B n\u0302 in the direction\nof n\u0302 = (sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8) is constructed starting from B = B \u1e91. First, it is rotated about the y axis by angle \u03b8. And it is subsequently rotated about the z axis by\nangle \u03c6. By applying SU(2) rotations corresponding to the above SO(3) rotations on the\nHamiltonian (1), one obtains the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian in the magnetic field B = B n\u0302\nH(\u03b8, \u03c6) = A I*S + a B*S + b B*I .\n\n(9)\n\nThe hyperfine interaction A I*S is spherical symmetric, so the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nof the Hamiltonian (9) are identical to those of the Hamiltonian (4) except replacing \u00b1 21\n\nby n\u0302; \u00b1 12 . Here n\u0302; \u00b1 12 are eigenstates of n\u0302*S or n\u0302*I. If the magnetic field B is rotated\nslowly about the z axis by 2\u03c0 to make a cone with a solid angle \u03a9 = 2\u03c0(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8), then\nthe instantaneous eigenstate n\u0302; \u00b1 21 follows it and accumulates the Berry phase \u03b2\u00b1 = \u2213 12 \u03a9.\n\nThe total Berry phase \u03b2 of electron and nuclear spins is the sum of two phases acquired by\neach one. It depends on the magnetic quantum number m\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2213\u03a9 for m = \u00b11 ,\n\u03b2=\n\uf8f3 0\nfor m = 0 .\n\n(10)\n\nAs expected, the Berry phase is nonzero only for real crossings, i.e., m = \u00b11. Fig. 2 (c) plots\nthe total Berry phase as a function of B and f and shows that the total Berry phase jumps\nat the level crossings. The zero Berry phase of the eigenstates E0\u00b1 (\u03b8, \u03c6) can be understood\nin two ways. First, two levels E0\u00b1 are avoided crossing at B = 0, so it is zero. Another view\n8\n\n\fis as follows. Since E0\u00b1 is a superposition of\n\n1\n, \u2212 12\n2\n\nand \u2212 12 , 21 , the Berry phase of the\n\nelectron spin is opposite to that of the nuclear spin and they cancel each other.\nAlthough the entangled states E0\u00b1 of electron and nuclear spins accumulates no Berry\nphase, each subsystem (electron spin or nuclear spin) can get nonzero marginal Berry phases\nof mixed states. Following the studies on geometric phase of mixed states [25, 26] and the\nrelation between entanglement and marginal Berry phases [26, 27, 28], we investigate the\nrelation between avoided level crossings, marginal Berry phases, and entanglement. For\nan adiabatic cyclic evolution parameterized by x, an instantaneous eigenstate of a bipartite\nP \u221a\npi |ei (x)i\u2297|fi (x)i,\nsystem AB can be expressed in a Schmidt decomposition |\u03c8(x)i = M\ni=1\n\nNB\nA\nwhere {|ei (x)i}N\ni=1 is an orthonormal basis for a subsystem A, {|fi (x)i}i=1 for a subsystem\nPM\nB, M \u2264 min{NA , NB }, and\ni=1 pi = 1. Here our attention is restricted to the case\n\u221a\nthat the Schmidt coefficients pi are independent of x. After an adiabatic cyclic evolution\n\nimplemented by x(0) = x(T ), the total Berry phase of the bipartite system AB is given by\n\u03b2=\n\nM\nX\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b2iA = i\n\nH\n\nC\n\n\u0001\npi \u03b2iA + \u03b2iB ,\n\n(11)\n\ndx* hei (x)| \u2207x |ei (x)i. Then the marginal mixed state Berry phase \u0393A of a\n\nsubsystem A is defined by\n\u0393A = arg\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0001\npi exp i\u03b2iA .\n\n(12)\n\nWith Eqs. (11) and (12), let us analyze how the total Berry phase and the marginal\nBerry phase of E0\u2212 depend on B. The two Schmidt coefficients are given by p1 = sin2\n\n\u03b1\n2\n\nand p2 = cos2 \u03b12 . It is easy to obtain the marginal Berry phase of the electron spin \u0393e =\n\u0001\narctan cos \u03b1 tan \u03a92 and the average Berry phase of the electron spin \u03b2e \u2261 p1 \u03b21e + p2 \u03b22e =\n\u03a9\n2\n\ncos \u03b1. In the limit of B \u226b 1, i.e., \u03b1 \u2192 0, one has E0\u2212 \u2192 \u2212 12 , 21 and \u03b2e = \u03a9/2. Also the\n\nmarginal Berry phase of the electron spin is given by \u0393e = \u03a9/2 for 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c02 . Fig. 3 plots\n\u0393e as a function of B and the azimuthal angle \u03b8. The marginal Berry phase of the electron\nspin jumps at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and B = 0. The node at B = 0 corresponds to the avoided crossing.\n\n9\n\n\fIV.\nA.\n\nTHE SODIUM ATOM IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD\nEnergy Spectrum\n\nNow we consider an\n\n23\n\nNa atom in its 3S1/2 ground state in the presence of a uniform\n\nmagnetic field B along the z axis. The nuclear and electron spins of an\n\n23\n\nNa atom are\n\nI = 2/3 and S = 1/2, respectively. As in Sec.

With the values of the parameters A, a, and b of the\n\n23\n\nNa atom in\n\n\u00b1\n/A are plotted in Fig. 4 (a). The von Neumann entropies of the\nRef.

Two levels, E+1\nand E+1\n, are avoided\nfor B > 0 and E\u22121\nis given by E+1\n\u221a\n+\nand\ncrossing and maximally entangled at A \u2212 (a \u2212 b)B = 3A. Another two levels, E\u22121\n\u221a\n\u2212\nE\u22121\n, are avoided crossing and maximally entangled at A + (a \u2212 b)B = 3A. Two levels\n\nwith m = 0, E0\u00b1 are avoided crossing and maximally entangled at B = 0. Two levels E\u00b12\n\nshow real crossing at B = 0 and have zero von Neumann entropies. Again one can see that\nthe eigenstate is maximally entangled at the avoided crossing point. This is analogous to\nthe results in Ref. [13], where Shannon entropy is used as an indicator of avoided crossings.\n\n11\n\n\fC.\n\nBerry phase\n\nAs in Sec. III C, let us consider an adiabatic cyclic evolution of nuclear and electron\nspins of a sodium atom by rotating the magnetic field B n\u0302 slowly. For a adiabatic rotation\nkeeping the azimuthal angle \u03b8 constant and varying the polar angle \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0, the\ninstantaneous eigenstates accumulates the total Berry phases proportional to the magnetic\nquantum number m, \u03b2 = \u2213m\u03a9. In contrast to a hydrogen atom, the ground state is given\n\u2212\n\u2212\nwith m = \u00b11, so it acquires the total Berry phase \u03b2 = \u2213\u03a9.\nor by E\u22121\neither by E+1\n\nLet us analyze how the marginal Berry phase of the entangled state is related to the\n\u2212\navoided crossings. We focus on the eigenstate, E+1\n. It has two Schmidt coefficients,\n\np1 = sin2\n\n\u03b11\n2\n\nand p2 = cos2\n\n\u03b11\n.\n2\n\nWith Eq. (11), one obtains the total phase as a sum of the\n\nBerry phases acquired by nuclear and electron spins with weights of the Schmidt coefficients,\n\u03b2 = sin2\n\n\u03b11\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03a92 \u2212\n\n\u03a9\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n+ cos2\n\n\u03b11\n2\n\n+ \u03a92 \u2212\n\n3\u03a9\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n= \u2212\u03a9 .\n\n(18)\n\nFrom Eq. (12), one obtains the marginal Berry phases of an electron spin \u0393e and of nuclear\nspin \u0393n\n\u0002\n\u0393n = arg sin2 \u03b121 e\u2212i\u03a9/2 + cos2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0393e = arctan cos \u03b11 tan \u03a92 .\n\n\u03b11\n2\n\n\u0003\ne\u2212i3\u03a9/2 ,\n\n(19a)\n(19b)\n\nFig. 5 plots the marginal Berry phase of a nuclear spin \u0393n as a function of B and the\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212 21 , 23 , \u0393e = \u03a9/2,\nazimuthal angle \u03b8. In the limit of B \u226b 1, i.e., \u03b11 \u2192 0, one has E+1\n\nand \u0393n = \u22123\u03a9/2. It is clearly seen that the node of the marginal Berry phase of a nuclear\n\u221a\n(or electron) spin corresponds to the avoid crossing at A + (a \u2212 b)B = 3A. Thus it could\nbe expected that the marginal Berry phase of a subsystem for an entangled state has a node\nat avoided crossings.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have considered the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonians for hydrogen and sodium atoms, describing the hyperfine interaction between a nuclear spin and an electron spin in the presence of\na magnetic field. We have examined the relation between level crossings, entanglement, and\nBerry phases. It is shown that entanglement between nuclear and electron spins is maximum\n12\n\n\fat avoided crossing points. The Berry phase and the von Neumann entropy change abruptly\nat level crossings as the parameters of the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom vary.\nAn entangled state encircling the avoided crossing acquires the marginal Berry phase of an\nelectron (or nuclear) spin like an eigenstate moving around the real crossing accumulates\na Berry phase. We have shown that the nodal points of the marginal Berry phase of an\nentangled state corresponds to the avoided crossing points.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is in part supported by the visitor program of Max Planck Institute for the\nPhysics of Complex Systems.
