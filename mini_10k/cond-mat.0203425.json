Introduction\nThe hole doped mixed valent La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 compound belonging to the\nperovskite family exhibits interesting electrical and magneto transport properties\nespecially, the colossal magneto resistance phenomena [1-3]. Though the well known\nDouble Exchange (DE) mechanism could explain the general feature viz., the metallic state\ncoexisting with the ferromagnetic ordering [4-5], subsequent works have shown the need\nto incorporate polaron (PO) mechanism due to the presence of strong electron phonon\ncoupling to account for the temperature dependence of resistivity in the paramagnetic\ninsulating state [6].\nExtensive La-site substitution studies have established the role of hole\nconcentration, average Mn-O bond length (dMn-O) and the average Mn-O-Mn bond angle\n(<Mn-O-Mn>) in controlling the effective one electron band width and hence the transport\nproperties and the magnetic transition temperatures, TC [7-10].\n\nEffects of Mn-site\n\nsubstitution with different elements such as Fe, Al, Cr, Co, Ga, Ti etc on the TC and other\nphysical properties have been reported by many workers [11-20]. It has been observed that\nall the substituents suppress the TC although to varied extents. Though the suppression in\nthe TC has been broadly ascribed to the weakening of the double exchange interaction, the\nvariation in the magnitudes of the suppression rate remains unexplained.\nIn addition to the average bond length and the bond angle, other factors such as the\nlocal structural disorder, the nature of the magnetic coupling between the neighboring\nspins and the destabilization of the Mn-O network are pertinent to DE and PO mechanisms\nand have not been addressed by the La-site substitution studies. Effecting appropriate Mnsite substitutions can delineate the different roles and in this paper we address the role of\nfirst two effects viz., the local structural disorder and the local magnetic coupling. We\n\n2\n\n\feffect Mn-site substitutions for a fixed concentration (5 at.%) with a) closed shell ions with\nsmaller (Al, Ti and Ga) as well as larger (Zr) ionic radii compared to that of Mn3+ to probe\nthe effects of the local structural disorder arising from the ionic radius mismatch and b)\nmagnetic ions Fe3+ (high spin - t2g3 eg2) of same ionic radius and Ru4+ (high spin state \u2013 t2g3\neg1), isoelectronic to Mn3+ to delineate the effect of magnetic coupling.\nIn this paper we show that the local structural disorder suppresses the TC. We also\nshow that the substitutions with magnetic ions coupling antiferromagnetically (Fe3+) with\nneighbouring spins suppress the TC. Based on our studies, we argue that enhancement of\nTC is possible on substituting a suitable magnetic ion which ferromagntically couple with\nthe Mn ions, although not observed experimentally so far.\n2. Experiment\nThe polycrystalline La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 and La0.67Ca0.33Mn0.95M0.05O3 (M=Al, Ga, Ti,\nZr, [Zr0.03Al0.02], Fe and Ru) were synthesized through standard solid-state reactions.\nPowder X-ray diffraction in reflection mode was carried out using CuK\u03b1 radiation. No\nimpurity phase could be detected from the X-ray diffraction studies. Lattice parameters\nwere obtained by Rietveld refinement. Resistivity measurement in Van der Pauw geometry\nwas carried out [21] using silver paint for contacts. AC susceptibility measurement was\ncarried out using a home built ac susceptometer. The reported Curie transition temperature\n(TC) corresponds to the onset of ac susceptibility signal, estimated by the tangent method.\nOxygen stiochiometry was estimated from weight loss in thermo gravimetric studies under\nthe reduced mixture of Ar (96%) and H2 (4%).\n\n3\n\n\f3. Results and Discussion\nThe powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the undoped and the substituted compounds\nwere recorded and representative data are shown in the Figure1. All the patterns except\nthat for [Zr0.03Al0.02] could be indexed to orthorhombic phases (space group: Pnma). The\nrefined lattice parameters are presented in the Table1. Among the substituents, while Al\nresults in a substantial reduction in the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume,\nappreciable increases were observed in the case of Zr substitution compared to that of the\nundoped compound. These observations are consistent with the magnitude and sign of the\nionic radius mismatch with respect to Mn3+ ion.\nTemperature dependence of resistivity and ac susceptibility for undoped and the\nsubstituted samples were measured and representative data are shown in the figures 2 and 3\nrespectively. All the samples showed metal-insulator transitions signified by characteristic\npeaks in the resistivity at T = TP(\u03c1) marking the metal to insulator transition. The values\nare given in the Table 1 along with the TC, from ac susceptibility measurements. For all the\ncompounds TP(\u03c1) matches closely with TC. Below TP(\u03c1), there is a sharp change in the\nresistivity exhibiting a positive d\u03c1/dT. A progressive shift of TP(\u03c1) to lower temperatures,\nan overall increase of resistivity over the entire temperature range and progressive\nbroadening at the peak were observed for the substituents Al, Ti,\n\nGa, Fe, Zr and\n\n[Zr0.03Al0.02] in that order. Interestingly, the resistivity of Ru substituted compound is lower\nthan that of undoped compound over the entire temperature range of measurement. Similar\nfeatures, viz., lowering of the TC and broadening of the transition could also be seen, with\nthe exception of Ru and Zr, in the susceptibility behaviour (Figure 3). In each case, the\nresistivity in the high temperature paramagnetic region could be fitted to an adiabatic small\npolaron model [12] and as a representative we show such a fitting for the Al doped\n\n4\n\n\fcompound as an inset in Fig. 2. The thermally activated hopping energy (EH) and the preexponential factor (B) are estimated and are given in Table 1. Due to the proximity of the\nTC to room temperature, fitting to the small polaron model was not possible for the\nundoped and Ru doped samples. The EH for the doped compounds are substantially higher\n(~140 meV) compared to that of undoped (85 meV) compound. Such an enhancement is in\ngeneral agreement with earlier observations [12]. However, we could not deduce any\nsystematic.\nIn earlier works it is reported that Al3+, Ga3+, Fe3+, Ru4+, Ti4+ [11-13,15,19 ] and Zr4+\n[22] substitute the Mn3+site. In figure 4 the TC suppression rate (dTC/dx) with respect to\nconcentration, for all the substituents is plotted as a function of their ionic radii (rM).\nConsidering the closed shell substituents, viz., Al, Ga Ti and Zr, it is seen that (dTC/dx)\nvaries monotonically with the absolute magnitude of ionic radii mismatch (\u2206r) between the\ndopant and the Mn3+ ion (\uf8e6rMn3+-rM\uf8e6) barring the Al doped compound. This indicates that\nthe local structural disorder arising from the ionic mismatch weakens the DE interaction,\nprobably through altering the dMn-O and/or <Mn-O-Mn>, which is reflected in the enhanced\nvalues of EH for the doped compounds. In order to reduce the effect of \u2206r, a combination of\nZr (larger ionic radius) and Al (smaller ionic radius) with their combined average ionic\nradius being equal to that of Mn3+ was substituted. Though the TC had marginally\nincreased, substantial suppression was still observed. As of now, the different behaviors of\nboth the Al and [Zr0.03Al0.02] substituted systems could not be explained and need further\ninvestigation.\nLet us consider the dTC/dx of compounds substituted with magnetic ions namely, Fe3+\n(S=5/2) and Ru4+ (S=2). Going by the ionic mismatch alone, it is expected that Fe\nsubstitution should result in the least suppression rate as it has the same ionic radius as that\n\n5\n\n\fof Mn3+. On the contrary, a large suppression rate of 18 K/at.% was observed. In this\ncontext, it is also to be noted here that Ga3+ having the same ionic size (hence same \u2206r) as\nthat of Ru4+ results in a suppression rate of 16K/at.%. On the other hand, the suppression\nrate for the Ru4+ substituted system is low, which is 2 K/at.%. Such striking differences in\nthe suppression rates can be rationalised by taking into account the nature of magnetic\ninteraction between the magnetic moments of the substituents and the Mn ion.\nIt has been shown from magnetisation and Mossbauer measurements that Fe ion\ncouples antiferromagnetically with the neighbouring Mn ions [15], which intrinsically\nweaken the strength of the DE interaction, and hence decreases the TC. However, Ru4+ is\nisoelectronic to Mn3+ and is known to couple ferromagnetically [23]. Such an interaction\ncan substantially compensate for the TC suppression due to ionic radius mismatch. Thus Ru\nsubstitution results in a lower value of dTC/dx compared to Ga substitution despite the fact\nthat both have same ionic radii. Another interesting feature in the resisitivity curve of Ru\ndoped compound is the presence of a hump in the metallic phase (marked by an arrow in\nthe Figure 2) which is much less prominent in the case of the undoped, and the Fe doped\ncompounds. However, no additional feature was observed in ac susceptibility in the\ntemperature range where the hump in the resistivity is seen. High-resolution powder X-Ray\ndiffraction studies on Ru, Fe doped and the undoped system indicated no impurity phase.\nHence the low temperature hump in the resistivity is intrinsic to the sample. Such a hump\nis also reported for Cr doped samples, which is also known to couple ferromagnetically\nwith the neighbouring Mn moments [24]. It appears that the resistivity hump in the\nmetallic region of these systems is a generic feature for ferromagnetically coupled\nsubstituents.\n\n6\n\n\f5. Conclusion\nWe\n\nhave\n\ninvestigated\n\nthe\n\nelectrical\n\nand\n\ntransport\n\nproperties\n\nof\n\nLa0.67Ca0.33Mn0.95M0.05O3 (M=Al, Ti, Ru, Ga, Fe, Zr and [Zr0.03Al0.02]). Substitutions did\nneither alter the crystal symmetry nor the oxygen stiochiometry. Both the metal\u2013insulator\nand ferromagnetic transition temperatures were found to suppress with substitutions to\nvaried extents. Two contributions affecting the transition temperature were identified: 1.\nLocal disorder arising from the ionic radius mismatch between the substituent and Mn ion;\nthe suppression rate found to monotonically increase with the absolute magnitude of ionic\nradius mismatch (\uf8e6rMn3+-rM\uf8e6). 2. Type of magnetic coupling between the magnetic\nmoments of the substituents and Mn ion; ions, which couple antiferromagnetically with\nMn ions, suppress the transition temperature.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A P Rameriz,J.Phys:Condens.Matter.9 8171(1997)\n[2] S.Jin, T H Tiefel, M McCormack, R A Fastnacht, R ramesh and L H Chen\nScience 264 413 (1994)\n[3] J M D Coey, M Viret and L Ranno, Phy.
