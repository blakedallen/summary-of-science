Milano, Italy\n\nAbstract\nIt has been shown in the past that the real part of the \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb ratio is particularly sensitive to anomalous gauge couplings that modify the Standard Model\nLagrangian. Due to the loose bounds on these couplings coming from low\nenergy processes and to the poor sensitivity of hadron colliders to couplings\nsuch as \u2206g1Z , it has been argued that anomalous couplings could still produce\nan enhancement of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb bringing this observable closer to the experimental\nvalue obtained by KTeV, NA31 and NA48. The impact of the new measurements done at LEP 2 in these years is discussed and new severe constraints\nto this hypothesis are determined.\n\n\fSince 1995, it has been noted [1] that anomalous triple gauge couplings (TGC) involving\nW W \u03b3 and W W Z vertices could modify significantly the Standard Model (SM) prediction\nconcerning \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb . More precisely, strong penguin diagrams and isospin breaking due to quark\nmasses completely dominate the SM prediction of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb for low values of mt . However, for\nmt of the order of 170 GeV, the effects of electroweak penguin diagrams are sizeable [2] and\ntherefore Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb becomes sensitive to anomalies in the bosonic sector of the SM.\nThe possibility that anomalous TGC could modify and, particularly, enhance Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb has\nbeen considered with interest, especially because several experimental measurements still\npoint towards a rather high value of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb with respect to the SM expectation. In fact,\npresent theoretical errors on Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb , coming mainly from the uncertainties in the models\nfor hadronic matrix elements, prevent us from drawing conclusions about the effectiveness\nof SM in the CP violating sector. On the other hand, it is interesting to quantify to what\nextent the hypothesis of anomalous enhancement of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is corroborated by the intense\nexperimental investigation on the bosonic sector of the SM carried out at LEP 2 since 1996.\nIt is customary to express general deviations from the SM in the bosonic sector in the\nframework of effective theories [3]. In this case, the most general Lagrangian invariant under\nUem (1) that contributes to W W V vertices (V = Z, \u03b3) [4,5] is:\nWV\n\u2212\n+\niLW\n= gW W V * [g1V V \u03bc (W\u03bc\u03bd\nW +\u03bd \u2212 W\u03bc\u03bd\nW \u2212\u03bd ) + \u03baV W\u03bc+ W\u03bd\u2212 V \u03bc\u03bd +\nef f\n\u2212\n+ M\u03bbV2 V \u03bc\u03bd W\u03bd+\u03c1 W\u03c1\u03bd\n+ ig5V \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 ((\u2202 \u03c1 W \u2212\u03bc )W +\u03bd \u2212 W \u2212\u03bc (\u2202 \u03c1 W +\u03bd ))V \u03c3 +\nW\n\n+ig4V W\u03bc\u2212 W\u03bd+ (\u2202 \u03bc V \u03bd + \u2202 \u03bd V \u03bc ) \u2212\n\n\u03ba\u0303V\n2\n\nW\u03bc\u2212 W\u03bd+ \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 V\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212\n\n\u03bb\u0303V\n2\n2MW\n\n\u2212\nW\u03c1\u03bc\nW\u03bd+\u03bc \u03b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 V\u03b1\u03b2 ] ,\n\n(1)\nwhere W \u00b1\u03bc are the W boson fields and V = \u03b3, Z. Defining gW W \u03b3 = e and gW W Z = e cot\u03b8W ,\nthis Lagrangian allows anomalous values for the C- and P-conserving couplings \u03ba\u03b3 , \u03baZ , g1Z ,\ng1\u03b3 (equal to 1 in SM). Moreover, new contributions coming from operators absent in the\nstandard theory are present. These are \u03bbV , which also conserves both C and P -parity; g5V\n(C and P violating but CP conserving) and the CP violating terms g4V , \u03ba\u0303V and \u03bb\u0303V . In\nterms of the W magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole they contribute as\n\u03bcW = (g1\u03b3 + \u03ba\u03b3 + \u03bb\u03b3 )\n\ne\n\u03b3)\ns ; QW = \u2212 e(\u03bam\u03b3 \u2212\u03bb\n,\n2\nW\n2mW\n\n(2)\n\nwhere eg\u03b31 is the W charge and s its spin. To simplify the notations, it is convenient to\nintroduce the deviation from the SM couplings\n\u2206g1V \u2261 g1V \u2212 1 , \u2206\u03baV \u2261 \u03baV \u2212 1 .\n1\n\n\fCP-violating terms are constrained by the neutron and electron electric dipole moments\n[6]. CP-conserving anomalous couplings affect low-energy rare decays [7], W production\nprocesses at high scales (LEP 2 and Tevatron) and electroweak corrections to the W ,Z, \u03b3\npropagator (\"oblique corrections\"). Oblique corrections have been extensively tested at the\nscale of mZ at LEP 1 and SLC. In order to evade the tight constraints already obtained\nfrom LEP at the Z 0 -pole, present LEP 2 measurements are expressed as limits to couplings\ncontributing to the effective Lagrangian (1) after imposing SU(2) \u2297 U(1) gauge invariance\nand retaining only the lowest dimension operators [8\u201310]. This approach implies relations\namongst the various TGC [10] and reduce the number of independent couplings to three:\n\u2206g1Z , \u03bb\u03b3 and \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 .\nThe CP-violating \u2206S = 1 interaction responsible for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 is affected, beyond strong\npenguins, by electroweak penguins and (possibly) TGC contributions changing both the\nI = 0 and I = 2 amplitude. At the scale of \u03bc = mW , the SM effective Hamiltonian (Hef f )\nfor \u2206S=1, modified in order to cope with anomalous TGC, has been computed in [11]. It\nhas been shown that the CP-violating couplings and \u2206\u03baZ do not contribute to leading order,\nbeing suppressed by factors of O((m2d,s , m2K )/m2W ). Running Hef f at the scale of \u03bc = 1 GeV\nimplies the knowledge of the boundary conditions of the Wilson coefficients in SM [12] and\nin the occurrence of anomalous couplings [11]. In the calculation of [11] a cut-off \u039b of 1 TeV\nhas been used for terms proportional to \u2206g1Z and \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 . The results obtained in [11] depend,\nin general, on the anomalous couplings \u2206g1Z ,\u2206\u03ba\u03b3 , \u03bb\u03b3 and g5Z , on the imaginary part of\nVtd Vts\u2217 and on the assumptions about the hadronic matrix elements.\nThe dependence of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb to anomalous TGC can be expressed in the following way:\n\u01eb\u2032\nRe\n\u01eb\n\n!\n\n\u2243 H Im(Vtd Vts\u2217 ) (1 + 0.96\u2206\u03ba\u03b3 + 0.16\u03bb\u03b3 \u2212 4.08\u2206g1Z + 0.44g5Z ) .\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the overall normalisation factor H depends mainly on the knowledge of the hadronic\nmatrix elements and, according to the calculation of [13], H \u2243 8.66. Due to the clear\ndominance of the term involving \u2206g1Z , Tevatron results do not modify significantly the lowenergy constraints and are not considered here. In the present analysis, we take the current\nallowed range of Im(Vtd Vts\u2217 ) from [14] and we assume\nIm(Vtd Vts\u2217 ) = (1.14 \u00b1 0.11) * 10\u22124\n\n(4)\n\nIt is well known that the status of the experimental measurement of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is not completely satisfactory. First results were obtained by NA31 [15] and were not confirmed by\nE731 [16]. Preliminary results from the KTeV [17] collaboration and from NA48 [18] strongly\nsupport a non-zero value of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb (fig.1). On the theoretical side, current calculations of\n2\n\n\fRe \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb in SM point, in general, towards lower values than those suggested by current experiments, even if the statistical significance is of the order of 2-2.5\u03c3 (for a review see [20,14]) and\nmake the hypothesis of an anomalous enhancement of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb due to TGC rather attractive.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that some very recent updates of the theoretical calculations of the hadronic matrix elements [14,19] could imply a higher value of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb which, if\nconfirmed, would ease the agreement of the SM predictions with the current experimental\nmeasurements without invoking new physics. On the other hand, for what concerns TGC\nthe hadronic matrix elements mainly affects the overall normalisation factor H being the relative contributions of the couplings (last factor of eq.(3) ) practically independent to them.\nTherefore, the allowed ranges derived in the following assuming H \u2243 8.66 can be updated\nin a straightforward manner by proper rescaling of H in eq.(3).\nExperimental measurements\n95% C.L.\nNA48\n\nKTeV\n\nE371\n\nNA31\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nRe \u03b5 \u0307/\u03b5 \u2022 10\n\n40\n-4\n\nFIG. 1.

All the limits are computed at 95% C.L.\n\nThe current situation is depicted in figure 3. Here the world average has been computed\ninflating the error until \u03c72 /ndf = 1, in order to deal with the discrepancy between the old\nE731 measurement and the analyses of KTeV, NA31 and NA48. Simple rejection of E731\nresults in a world average of ( 21.6 \u00b1 2.7 ) * 10\u22124 . The allowed range for \u2206g1Z combines\nthe 95% C.L. limits coming from ALEPH, DELPHI, OPAL and L3 [21] summing up the\naccumulated statistics from 1996 to 1999 taken at centre-of-mass energies ranging from\n161 GeV to 202 GeV. Here, statistical and systematic uncertainties are included.\nThe remarkable improvement in the experimental tests of anomalous values of\n\u2206g1Z\n\nstrongly constraints the hypothesis of anomalous enhancement, bringing the allowed\n\nrange of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb to\n8.0 10\u22124 < Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb < 13.7 10\u22124\n\n(95% C.L.) ,\n\n(5)\n\n(95% C.L.) .\n\n(6)\n\nto be compared with the pre-LEP 2 measurement of\n5.4 10\u22124 < Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb < 30.5 10\u22124\n4\n\n\fRe \u03b5 \u0307/\u03b5 \u2022 10-4\n\nCurrent data (LEP included)\n40\n\n95% C.L.\n\n35\n30\n25\n\nWorld average\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n-1\n\n-0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u2206g\n\nZ\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nRe \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb as a function of \u2206g1Z for the range of this coupling allowed by low energy\n\nand LEP data (fixing all the couplings but \u2206g1Z to their SM values). The vertical width of the\ndark band represents the variation of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb corresponding to a change of \u00b12\u03c3 of Im(Vtd Vts\u2217 ). The\nhorizontal extent of the dark band represents the allowed range of \u2206g1Z . The light band indicates\nthe current world average of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb (see text for details). All the limits are computed at 95% C.L.\n\nThese limits have been extracted assuming that only \u2206g1Z is different from zero. In fact,\nsingle W production at LEP 2 strongly constraints contributions to the effective Lagrangian\ncoming from operators proportional to \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 . The accumulated LEP 2 statistics allows a\nsimultaneous fit of \u2206g1Z and \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 (again, all other couplings have been fixed to their SM\nvalue). The corresponding allowed range for Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is\n7.9 10\u22124 < Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb < 15.6 10\u22124\n\n95% C.L.\n\n(7)\n\nContributions from other couplings have very limited impact on Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb by virtue of\neq.(3). It has to be noted that results for the TGC parameters have been quoted without\nuse of a form factor \u039b, describing the scale at which new physics should become manifest.\nInclusion of such a parameter with \u039b = 1 TeV, for sake of consistency with [11], and form\nfactors of the type used, for example, in [22] would increase the limits obtained for Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb by\nno more than 4%.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that present LEP 2 data highly constrain the hypothesis of\na non-standard enhancement of Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb coming from anomalies in the bosonic sector of the\n5\n\n\fSM. In particular, the sensitivity of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 to \u2206g1Z allows a reduction\nof the possible contribution to Re \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb from this coupling by a factor of about 4.\nAcknowledgements\nI'm greatly indebted to X.-G.
