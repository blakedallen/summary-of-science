This interest is of fundamental character, but it is also motivated by the fact that many possible applications exist. For example, they can be useful to understand and develop rectifiers, pumps, particle\nseparation devices, molecular switches, and transistors.\nAlso, there is great interest in biology, since the working principles of molecular motors can be explained in\nterms of ratchet mechanisms [2]. Finally, we would like\nto mention cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates as\npromising fields of application, thanks to recent developments of the techniques needed to manipulate them\n[3, 4]. In the following we will have in mind systems that\npresent chaotic features, since ratchets generally behave\nthis way [5, 6, 7]. Hence, methods from classical and\nquantum chaos become extremely useful.\nThe explanation of the appearance of a net current,\ni.e., average momentum different from zero, is one of the\nmain topics of this research. In a classical context, this\nbehavior can be understood in terms of broken symmetries. One of the most convincing points of view up to\nnow, is that all symmetries of the system leading to momentum inversion (i.e., sign change) should be broken in\norder to have a net directed current [7]. This amounts to\nsay that, being only a necessary condition, we can follow\nCurie's principle, and assume that if the current is not\nforbidden by symmetries, then it should be present. In\nnon-Hamiltonian cases, the asymmetrization of a chaotic\nattractor leads to a net directed current [5]. In Hamiltonian systems the asymmetrization of a chaotic layer\nembedded in a mixed phase space, for example, has the\nsame consequences for a set of initial conditions inside of\nit [8, 9]. In this case, a mixed dynamics is in general a\nnecessary condition (for a notable exception see [10, 11]).\nThe vast majority of the previously mentioned papers\nwere focused on the classical aspects, leaving the quantum side less explored. However, there has been sev-\n\neral recent publications that deal with this part of the\nproblem. These works regard both the experimental [12]\n(systems of cold atoms, mainly) and the theoretical sides\n[8, 10, 13]. In general the quantum versions share symmetry aspects with their classical counterparts, showing\nthe corresponding current. But sometimes the relation\nbetween symmetries and the generated current are less\nobvious in the quantum case. Tunneling, for example,\ncan modify the direction of the current [14]. Interference, in any of its forms, generates more complex behaviors [15]. In fact, we will see that the quantum and\nclassical behaviors can be very different.\n\nA remarkable situation appears in some cases, when\none can find a net quantum current that does not have\na classical counterpart. This was essentially studied in\nHamiltonian (non dissipative) systems. The first time\nthis phenomenon was found was in the modified kicked\nrotor (KR) at quantum resonance (i.e., the usual KR with\na second harmonic in the kick) [16, 17]. This is a classically chaotic system where the time reversal symmetry\nchanging the sign of the momentum is kept. Later, in\nthe case of the modified kicked Harper model [18], the\nclassical current was found to be exceedingly small in\ncomparison with the quantum one. In all of these cases\nthe current does not reach an asymptotic value, and in\nfact these systems were called quantum ratchet accelerators. We present here a different behavior by means of a\nmodified multibaker map [19, 20]. This system models a\nparticle evolving with free flights and collisions with fixed\nscatterers. We were able to find a finite asymptotic current that is only present in the quantized version. This\nsuggests a general method for obtaining purely quantum\nratchets (no classical current), without unbounded acceleration. We propose this system as a model to study\ngeneral quantum transport phenomena in the presence of\nasymmetries.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe well known classical baker's transformation is an\narea-preserving map defined on the unit square phasespace (0 \u2264 q, p \u2264 1). Here we use an asymmetric version\nwhich divides the phase space into two regions with different areas and Lyapunov exponents. The general form\nof this map can be written in terms of one parameter\ns \u2208 (0, 1)\n\u0001\n\u001a\n1\nq, sp\ns\n\u0001 0\u2264q\u2264s\nBs (q, p) \u2261\n(1 \u2212 s)\u22121 (q \u2212 s), (1 \u2212 s)p + s s \u2264 q \u2264 1\n(1)\nwhere we can recover the usual symmetrical case by setting s = 1/2. The geometric action of the map is represented in Fig. 1 (top).\n\nterm is defined as\n\u001a\n(m + 1, q, p) 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1/2\nT =\n(m \u2212 1, q, p) 1/2 \u2264 q \u2264 1\n\n(4)\n\nThe geometric action of the multibaker map in the phase\nspace of a lattice of squares is represented in Fig. 1 (bottom). While the baker's map is asymmetric, the transport term is unbiased as phase space volume is transported symmetrically, as can be clearly seen. Notice that\nthe transport is entirely due to translations and therefore\nthere are no tunneling effects from cell to cell.\nThis transformation is not biased neither in the p nor\nin the q coordinate; the reason is that the baker transformation maps the unit square onto itself and the transport term is balanced, as previously explained. This is\nthe equivalent to the zero average net force typical of\nthe dynamical systems addressed in studies of directed\ntransport [1]. In what follows we will focus on the coarse\ngrained current, that in the classical case is defined by\nJclass (t) = hm(t)i \u2212 hm(t \u2212 1)i\n\n(5)\n\nIn this expression hm(t)i is the average value of the cell\nposition m for a given ensemble of initial conditions, at\na time t. It is easy to see that this definition does not\ntake care of the fluctuations inside of each cell. However,\nwe underline that there is no bias, making this model\ncompletely general.\nFrom the classical point of view, the presence or absence of an asymptotic current follows the general criteria\nspecified in [7] and depends on the symmetries that reverse the sign of the transport. Here there are two such\nsymmetries\nFIG. 1: Geometric action of the asymmetric baker's map on\neach cell (top) and of the composition with the translation,\ni.e., the asymmetric multibaker map (bottom).\n\nThe quantum version of the map is defined in a discrete\nD-dimensional Hilbert space with h = 1/D in terms of\nthe quantum Fourier transform with antiperiodic boundary conditions [21, 22].\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u011cD1 0\n(2)\nB\u0302s = \u011c\u2020D\n0 \u011cD2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2261 D\u22121/2 e\u2212i2\u03c0(k+1/2)(l+1/2)/D\n(3)\n\u011cD\nkl\n\nwhere the allowed values of s are such that D1 = sD and\nD2 = D \u2212 D1 are integer numbers. The same procedure\ncan be done to obtain an entire family of asymmetric\nquantum baker maps (QBMs) [23, 24].\nThe classical multibaker map [19] is defined in a twodimensional lattice where the phase space at each lattice\nsite is a unit square. The dynamics of the map is a combination of transport to neighboring cells and a local evolution within a cell. The map is defined as Ms = Bs \u25e6 T ,\nwhere the baker term is the asymmetric baker map defined in Eq. 1 applied on each cell m, and the transport\n\nSI :\nSII :\n\nq \u2192 1 \u2212 q; p \u2192 1 \u2212 p; T \u2192 T\nq \u2192 p; p \u2192 q; T \u2192 T \u22121 ; t \u2192 \u2212t\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nThe first one maps Bs to B1\u2212s , and therefore is broken\nunless s = 1/2. SII is a time reversal symmetry and is\npreserved at all times. Thus, according to the criteria of\n[7] there cannot be an asymptotic classical current for unbiased initial conditions. Transient effects can be present\nfor biased conditions but will die off very rapidly due to\nthe exponential mixing property of the Baker map. Numerical calculations confirm this expectation (see inset\nof Fig. 2(b) and caption).\nThe quantum multibaker map is the composition of a\ntranslation on the lattice site that depends on the value\nof the projectors acting on the right and left subspaces\nof the baker map at each cell [20]. This can be written\nas\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\nM\u0302s \u2261 B\u0302s \u25e6 T\u0302 = I\u02c6 \u2297 B\u0302s \u00db \u2297 P\u0302R + \u00db \u2020 \u2297 P\u0302L , (8)\nwhere PR and PL are the projectors and \u00db is a unitary translation operator acting on the lattice subspace\n\u00db |mi = |m + 1i (with {|mi, m = . . . , \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, . . .}\nthe basis set of the lattice).\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nJ\n\nThe discrete time propagation of an initial state \u03c10 =\n\u03c1lat \u2297 \u03c1QBM is\n\u0010 \u0011t \u0010 \u0011t\n\u03c1(t) = M\u0302s \u03c10 M\u0302s\u2020\n\n(9)\n\nHere we will focus on initial states localized in one site\nof the lattice \u03c1lat = |0ih0|. A word regarding the analogy with quantum walks is in order here. In fact, this\nsystem can be thought as the D-dimensional quantum\nbaker map coupled to a quantum walker in an infinite dimensional lattice [25, 26]. The role of the quantum coin\nin the quantum walk is performed here by the quantum\nbaker map. The fact that the coin is classically ergodic\nis however an important difference, and is a fundamental\nreason for having no classical current.\nThe transport properties of the system can be computed with the coarse grained density of probabilities of\nthe lattice. This distribution is obtained by tracing out\nthe internal degrees of freedom inside each cell and projecting on the lattice basis.

First, we\npoint out that if we take a mixed superposition of centered eigenstates of momentum as the initial condition\nfor the QBM, we find that there is no current (J) for\nthe symmetric case (s = 1/2). This confirms the need to\nbreak the SI symmetry in order to have a net directed\ntransport. Throughout the following calculations we consider as initial condition the mixed state corresponding\nto the incoherent superposition of the two central momentum eigenstates, i.e.\n\u0012\n\u001d\u001c \u0013\n\u001d\u001c\n1\nD\nD\nD\nD\n\u03c1QBM = \u011cD\n\u22121\n\u22121 +\n\u011c\u2020D\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(13)\nFig. 2(a) shows the coarse grained current as a function of time with Hilbert space dimension D = 32.\nWe have plotted the results corresponding to its maximum negative and positive asymptotic values, for which\nD1 = 17 and D1 = 30 respectively (s = D1 /D \u2208 [0.5, 1)).\nIt is worth mentioning that J rapidly reaches a stationary behavior (at about t = 50) with fluctuations centered\naround a finite non-zero value as it is illustrated by the\nsmoothed current in Fig. 2 (solid lines). This shows that\nno unbounded acceleration is present, so there is a rectification of transport rather than an effective force in this\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a): Coarse grained current J as a\nfunction of time for the QBM with D = 32 and D1 = 17\n(dot\u2013dashed line) and D1 = 30 (dotted line). In solid lines\nthe smoothed current over 20 steps is shown. The solid line at\nJ = 0 corresponds to the classical current calculated for 108\ninitial conditions. (b): The probability distribution P (m, t)\nat time t = 200 for the same cases as before, s = 17/32 and\ns = 30/32 in the classical and quantum version with D = 32.\nIn the inset we show how the net current become null in the\nclassical case for different initial conditions, calculated for 108\npoints in phase space, in particular for two squares of area\n1/16 centered in (q, p) = (1/8, 1/2) (s = 0.6 (+) and s = 0.8\n(\u00d7)) and (3/8, 1/2) (s = 0.6 (\u22c6) and s = 0.8 (\u0003)).\n\npurely quantum ratchet. The classical current for analog initial conditions is also displayed, being zero at all\ntimes. In Fig. 2(b) we show the probability distribution\nP (m, t) and its classical version.\nIn Fig. 3(a) we can see the averaged (asymptotic)\ncoarse grained current hJi as a function of the Hilbert\nspace dimension D for D1 = D \u2212 2 and D1 = D/2 \u2212 1 (in\norder to make this averages we have taken the values of\nthe current from t = 100 up to t = 450). These cases are\nthose at which J approximately reaches its maxima in absolute value (positive and negative current, respectively).\nWe observe a smooth dependence of this quantity on D\n(apart from small fluctuations), showing that the effect\n\n\f4\nis generic. In fact, this situation is completely different\nfrom previous cases [16, 17]. In these works a purely\nquantum current was found only at resonant values of a\nmodified KR.\nIn Fig.3(b) we show the averaged current vs s for different fixed values of D with s \u2265 0.5. We do not show\nvalues for s < 0.5 since J turns out to be an odd function of s around s = 0.5 (hJs i = \u2212hJ1\u2212s i). In fact, if\nwe apply the symmetry transformation SI to Eq. 9, and\nthen trace out the internal degrees of freedom inside of\neach cell we obtain that Ps (m, t) = P1\u2212s (\u2212m, t) for all\nt. This result is valid for any initial \u03c1QBM symmetrical\nunder SI . Therefore, the symmetry of the current becomes clear (details will be presented elsewhere [28]). As\na consequence, there is a simple way to obtain current\ninversion in our system.\n0.06\n(a)\n0.04\nD1=D/2+1\nD1=D-2\n\n0.02\n<J> 0\n-0.02\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have found a finite asymptotic current\nin a modified and unbiased quantum multibaker map;\nthis current has no classical counterpart. Moreover, we\ncan invert its direction by exploiting a symmetry with\nrespect to the SI transformation. This is much in the\nsame spirit as the corresponding current inversions found\nin the literature [6, 11].\nThe behavior of our system is rather similar to what\nhappens in quantum walks. Different combinations of\nthe initial states and/or the unitary operators associated\nto the quantum coin produce a different bias in the final\ndistribution of probabilities [27]. We believe that this\nproperty, that is of pure quantum origin is the reason for\nfinding a net transport in our system. In fact, we think\nthat the existence of a net current is due exclusively to\ninterference effects which persists in the D \u2192 \u221e limit.\nTo obtain the classical behavior, i.e., a vanishing current,\nsome noise has to be introduced, just as in the case of\nquantum walk [26].\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nD\n0.06\n(b)\n\nD=16\nD=32\nD=64\n\n0.04\n0.02\n<J> 0\n\nWe underline that this is a completely different case\nthan that explained in [13], where the quantum current\nappearance is explained by means of the desymmetrization of Floquet states, fact that can be directly related\nto the corresponding classical properties of the system.\nA detailed study of this will be presented elsewhere [28].\nFinally, we consider that the features of this map can\nbe exploited to design generic Hamiltonian systems that\nbehave in a similar way. In that case, there will be the\npossibility to implement them in cold atoms experiments.\n\n-0.02\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\ns\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Averaged coarse grained current hJi:\n(a) for different values of the dimension of the Hilbert space\n(D) of the QBM with fixed D1 = D/2 + 1 and D1 = D \u2212 2;\nand (b) for the rational values of s = D1 /D \u2208 [0.5; 1) with\nD = 16, 32, 64.
