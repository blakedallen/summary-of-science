LIGO's noise\ncurve has been lowered by about three orders of magnitude and now the\ndetectors are operating at the design sensitivity. Similar progresses have been\nachieved by Virgo, although some effort remains to be done to reach the\nplanned sensitivity at low frequencies (\u223c (10 \u2212 40) Hz). In any event, these\ndetectors are now in a position to take data good enough to start making\nscience: a supernova exploding in the local group of nearby galaxies would\nnot be missed, as well as the coalescence of compact bodies, neutron stars or\nblack holes, with total mass smaller than about 100 M\u2299 , out to a distance\nof the orders of few Megaparsecs (these estimates are only indicative, since\nthey are continuously updated as the detector sensitivities are improved).\nThe detection of gravitational signals will allow to test the predictions of the\ntheoretical work that has been done over the years to construct waveforms\nand energy spectra, and to extract distinctive features which could be traced\nback to the nature and to the structure of the source. An important piece\nDipartimento di Fisica \"G. Marconi\", Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma and INFN,\nSezione Roma 1, P.le A. Moro 2, 00185 Roma, Italy\n\n\f2\n\nof information is provided by the frequencies at which a compact object\noscillates and emits gravitational waves, i.e the quasi-normal mode (QNM)\nfrequencies. In this paper we shall discuss the pulsation properties of black\nholes and neutron stars, focussing in particular on the information they carry\nabout the emitting source.\nAccounts on quasi-normal modes of stars and black holes can also be\nfound in [2] and [3].\n2 Do black holes oscillate?\nAccording to General Relativity, quasi-normal modes are the proper modes\nat which a black hole, or a star, oscillates when excited by a non radial\nperturbation. They are said quasi-normal, in contrast to the normal modes\nof Newtonian gravity, because they are damped by the emission of gravitational waves; as a consequence, the corresponding eigenfrequencies are complex. That a star can oscillate is, in some sense, obvious because a star is\na ball of fluid 1 ; however, when the idea that also black holes possess some\nproper modes of vibration was firstly proposed, it raised considerable surprise. Indeed, a black hole is not a material object, it is a singularity hidden\nby a horizon: how can it possibly oscillate? In order to understand how this\nbizarre behaviour was discovered, we need to go back to half a century ago\nand to the early theory of black hole perturbations.\n2.1 Schwarzschild perturbations are described by two wave equations\nIn 1957 T. Regge and J.A. Wheeler [6] showed that the equations describing\nthe perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole can be separated if the perturbed metric tensor is expanded in tensorial spherical harmonics. They also\nshowed that the relevant equations split into two decoupled sets belonging\nto different parity - (\u22121)l (even or polar) and (\u22121)l+1 (odd or axial) -\nand that, by a suitable choice of the gauge and by Fourier-expanding the perturbed functions, the equations for the radial part of the axial perturbations\nof a Schwarzschild black hole can be reduced to a single Schroedinger-like\nwave equation with a potential barrier, for a suitably defined function Zl\u2212 :\nd2 Zl\u2212\n+ [\u03c9 2 \u2212 Vl\u2212 (r)]Zl\u2212 = 0,\ndr\u22172\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nVl\u2212 (r) =\n\n1\nr3\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n2M\n[l(l + 1)r \u2212 6M ] , r\u2217 = r + 2M log(\n1\u2212\n\u2212 1). (2)\nr\n2M\n\nThis equation is known as the Regge-Wheeler equation. A similar result\nwas obtained later in 1970 by F. Zerilli [7], who showed that also the polar\n1\nThe study of stellar oscillations started at the beginning of the past century,\nwhen Shapley [4] (1914) and Eddington [5] (1918) suggested that the variability\nobserved in some stars is due to periodic pulsations.\n\n\f3\n\nequations can be reduced to the wave equation (1) for a suitably defined\nfunction Zl+ , and with a different potential barrier\nVl+ (r) =\n\n2(r \u2212 2M )\n[n2 (n + 1)r3 + 3M n2 r2 + 9M 2 nr + 9M 3 ] ,\nr4 (nr + 3M )2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n = 12 (l\u22121)(l+2). If the perturbation is excited by a source, on the lefthand side there will be a forcing term obtained from the harmonic expansion\nof the stress-energy tensor of the exciting source. The wave equations for the\naxial and polar perturbations describe the way in which a non rotating black\nhole reacts to an external perturbation, and the gravitational signal emitted\nby the perturbed black hole can be calculated in terms of the two functions\nZl\u2212 and Zl+ as follows:\n\u0015\nZ i\u03c9(t\u2212r\u2217 ) X \u0014\nZ \u2212 (r, \u03c9) X lm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n1\ne\n+\nd\u03c9\nh+ (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\nZlm\n(r, \u03c9)W lm (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u2212 lm\n2\u03c0\nr\ni\u03c9\nsin \u03b8\nlm\n\u0015\nZ i\u03c9(t\u2212r\u2217 ) X \u0014\n\u2212\n(r, \u03c9) lm\ne\nX lm (\u03b8, \u03c6) Zlm\n1\n+\n+\nW (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03c9\nZlm\n(r, \u03c9)\nh\u00d7 (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n2\u03c0\nr\nsin \u03b8\ni\u03c9\nlm\n\n(4)\n\n+\n\n\u00d7\n\nwhere h , h are the two polarizations of the gravitational wave in the\ntransverse-traceless gauge (see [8], Chapter 35), and\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\nlm\n2\n\u2202\u03c6 Y lm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nW (\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03b8 \u2212\nsin2 \u03b8\nX lm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = 2 (\u2202\u03b8\u03c6 \u2212 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03c6 ) Y lm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n(5)\nwhere Y lm are scalar spherical harmonics. Note that, since we are considering\n\u00b1\nperturbations of a spherically symmetric spacetime, Zlm\ncoincides with Zl\u00b1\nfor any value of m.\n2.2 Quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole\nIn 1970 Vishveshwara [9] pointed out that equation (1) for the functions\nZl\u2212 and Zl+ allows complex frequency solutions which satisfy the following\nboundary conditions\nZl \u2192 ei\u03c9r\u2217 ,\nZl \u2192 e\u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 ,\n\nr\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nr\u2217 \u2192 +\u221e;\n\nthe former represents a pure ingoing wave, since nothing can escape from a\nblack hole horizon, the latter represents a pure outgoing wave at radial infinity and corresponds to the requirement that no radiation is incoming from\ninfinity. This idea was confirmed by Press [10] who found, by integrating the\nwave equation numerically, that an arbitrary initial perturbation decays as a\npure frequency mode. However, only in 1975 Chandrasekhar and Detweiler\n\n\f4\n\n[11] actually computed the discrete eigenfrequencies of these modes and clarified their nature. Quoting Chandrasekhar from its book The Mathematical\nTheory of Black Holes [12]:\n\".. we may expect on general grounds that any initial perturbation will,\nduring its last stages, decay in a manner characteristic of the black hole\nand independently of the original cause. In other words, we may expect that\nduring the very last stages, the black hole will emit gravitational waves with\nfrequencies and rates of damping, characteristic of itself, in the manner of\na bell sounding its last dying pure note. These considerations underlie the\nformulation of the concept of the quasi-normal modes of a black hole.\"\nA Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by only one parameter, its\nmass M ; consequently, the QNM frequencies depend only on M . In Table 1\nwe show the values of the complex characteristic frequencies of the first four\nQNMs of a Schwarzschild black hole, respectively for l = 2 and l = 3.\nIn order to find the true pulsation frequency, \u03bd, and the damping time, \u03c4 ,\nTable 1 The lowest QNM frequencies of a Schwarzschild black hole for l = 2\nand l = 3. They are the same both for the polar and for the axial perturbations,\ni.e. the two potential barriers (2) and (3) are isospectral.\n\nl=2\n\nM \u03c90 + iM \u03c9i\n0.3737+i0.0890\n0.3467+i0.2739\n0.3011+i0.4783\n0.2515+i0.7051\n\nl=3\n\nM \u03c90 + iM \u03c9i\n0.5994+i0.0927\n0.5826+i0.2813\n0.5517+i0.4791\n0.5120+i0.6903\n\nfrom the values given in Table 1, we proceed as follows. Let us assume that\nthe black hole mass is M = nM\u2299 , (M\u2299 = 1.48 * 105 cm); converting to\nphysical unities we find\nnM\u2299\nn * 0.4937 * 10\u22125\n=\ns.\n(M \u03c9i )c\n(M \u03c9i )\n(6)\nUsing these expressions we can check whether a gravitational signal emitted\nby an oscillating black hole falls within the bandwidth of the ground based\ninterferometers Virgo/LIGO or within that of the space based interferometer\nLISA. Virgo/LIGO bandwidth extends over a range of frequencies which\ngoes from about 10-40 Hz, up to few kHz. Thus, these detectors will be able\nto detect the signal emitted by an oscillating black hole (if it is sufficiently\nstrong) with mass ranging within\n\u03bd=\n\n32.26\nc\n=\n(M \u03c90 ) kHz,\n2\u03c0n * M\u2299 (M \u03c90 )\nn\n\n\u03c4=\n\n3\n10 M\u2299 <\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 ,\n\u223cM <\n\ncorresponding to the frequency range \u03bd \u2208 [12 Hz, 1.2 kHz]; LISA will be\nsensitive to the frequency region \u03bd \u2208 [10\u22124 , 10\u22121 ] Hz, and will see oscillating\nblack holes with mass\n8\n1.2 * 105 M\u2299 <\n\u223c 1.2 * 10 M\u2299 .\n\u223cM <\n\n\f5\n\nFor instance, LISA will be able to detect signals emitted by the oscillations\nof the massive black hole at the center of our Galaxy SGR A*, the mass of\nwhich is M = (3.7 \u00b1 0.2) * 106 M\u2299 [13].\nWhile the frequencies of the lowest modes are rather easy to compute,\ngreat care must be used to determine the entire spectrum. Many different\nmethods have been used to this purpose. For instance, a WKB approximation\nand a higher order WKB approach have been used to find the lowest [14] and\nthe higher mode frequencies [15], respectively. In addition, new approaches\nhave been developed to study the QNM spectrum, as the continued fraction method (developed for Kerr black holes in [16]) and the phase-integral\nmethod [17]. Using these approaches, it has been found [18] that, for any\nvalue of the harmonic index l, as the order n of the mode increases, the real\npart of a mode frequency approaches a non zero limiting value. Furthermore,\nan analytical expression has been found for the imaginary part of the frequency, valid in the limit n \u2192 \u221e. We also mention that an exact, analytical\nsolution of the Regge-Wheeler equation has recently been found in terms of\nthe Heun functions. QNM eigenfrequencies can be computed in terms of this\nsolution, by solving numerically a boundary value problem [19].\n\n2.3 The quasi-normal modes of a Kerr black hole\nAfter 1975 the study of black hole perturbations follows along two principal avenues. One studies directly the perturbations of the metric tensor via\nEinstein's equations linearized about a given background. The other studies\nthe perturbations of Weyl's and Ricci's scalars using the Newman-Penrose\nformalism. Using this latter approach in 1972 Teukolsky [20] was able to\ndecouple and separate the equations governing the perturbations of a Kerr\nblack hole, and to reduce them to a single master equation for the radial part\nof the perturbation Rlm :\n\uf8f1\n\u2206Rlm,rr + 2(s \u0002+ 1)(r \u2212 M )Rlm,r + V (r)Rlm = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n1\n2\n(r\n+ \u0002a2 )2 \u03c9 2 \u2212 4aM rm\u03c9 +\u0003a2 m2 + 2is(am(r \u2212 M )\nVlm (r, \u03c9) = \u2206\n\u0003\n\uf8f4 \u2212M \u03c9(r2 \u2212 a2 )) r + 2is\u03c9r \u2212 a2 \u03c9 2 \u2212 Alm\n\uf8f3\n\u2206 = r2 \u2212 2M r + a2 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe angular part, Slm , satisfies the equations of the oblate spheroidal harmonics\n(\ni\nh\n2\nSlm = 0, (8)\n[(1 \u2212 u2 )Slm,u ],u + a2 \u03c9 2 u2 \u2212 2am\u03c9su + s + Alm \u2212 (m+su)\n2\n1\u2212u\nu = cos \u03b8,\nand the complete wavefunction is\n\u03c8s (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nei\u03c9t\n\n\u221e\nl\nX\nX\n\nl=|s| m=\u2212l\n\neim\u03c6 Slm (u)Rlm (r)d\u03c9.\n\n(9)\n\n\f6\n\nIn these equations s is the spin-weight parameter s = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, for scalar,\nelectromagnetic and gravitational perturbations, respectively 2 , and Alm is\na separation constant.\nIt is interesting to note that, unlike the potential barrier of a Schwarzschild\nblack hole, which is real and independent of the harmonic index m and of\nthe frequency, the potential barrier of a Kerr black hole is complex, and it\ndepends on m and on the frequency \u03c9.\nAn interesting phenomenon occurs when electromagnetic or gravitational\nwaves are scattered by Kerr's potential barrier Vlm (r, \u03c9); if the incident wave\nhas a frequency in the range\n0 < \u03c9 < \u03c9c\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c9c =\n\nam\n,\n2M r+\n\nm > 0,\n\n(10)\n\nthe reflection coefficient associated to V (r) exceeds unity [21,22]. This phenomenon is called superradiance, and it is the analogue, in the domain of\nwave propagation, of Penrose's process in the domain of particle creation.\nThe quasi-normal frequencies of a Kerr black hole have been computed by\nDetweiler [23], and subsequently by Leaver [16], Seidel & Iyer [24], Kokkotas\n[25] and Onozawa [26]. Since rotation removes the degeneracy presented by\nSchwarzschild's modes, there is a set of eigenmodes for any assigned value of\nthe harmonic indexes l and m. The calculations show that when the black\nhole angular momentum a increases, the real part of the complex eigenfrequencies is bounded, but the imaginary part is not. Moreover, when a Kerr\nblack hole becomes \"extreme\", i.e. when a \u2192 M, highly damped modefrequencies converge to the purely real value of the critical frequency below\nm\n. In this context, an inwhich superradiant scattering occurs, \u03c9c = 2M\nteresting result was obtained by Detweiler in 1977 [23]. He found that when\na \u2192 M, the imaginary part of the mode-frequencies tends to zero. If excited,\nthese modes would set the black hole into an oscillation that would never decay, suggesting that extreme Kerr black holes are \"marginally unstable\". It\nwas subsequently shown by B. Mashoon and one of the authors that when\na \u2192 M the amplitude of the \"unstable\" modes tends to zero, and consequently quasi-normal modes belonging to real frequency cannot exist in the\nordinary regime [27].\nAs for a Schwarzschild black hole, in the n \u2192 \u221e limit the imaginary\npart of the mode frequencies has an analytical expression which has been\ndetermined in [28].\n2.4 Excitation of black hole quasi-normal modes\nBlack holes quasi-normal modes are excited in many astrophysical processes,\nand are a fundamental feature of the gravitational signal. Therefore they\nare of utmost importance for the data analysis of gravitational wave experiments. The first simulation of black hole oscillations excited by an external\n2\n+ and \u2212 indicate the ingoing and outgoing radiative part of the considered\nfield. For example s = +2 corresponds to \u03c82 = \u03a80 , and s = \u22122 to \u03c8\u22122 = \u03a84 ,\nwhere \u03a80 and \u03a84 are the Weyl scalars.\n\n\f7\n\nsource dates back to 1971: in [29] a Schwarzschild black hole was perturbed\nby a radially infalling point-like body, with a mass much smaller than the\nblack hole mass. The energy spectrum of the emitted signal was computed\nby solving the Zerilli equation with a source describing the infalling particle.\nThe waveform was explicitly computed in [30], and it was shown that, after\na transient, the signal exhibits a ringing tail, which can be fitted by a combination of quasi-normal modes. In Figure 1, we show the gravitational wave\namplitude r * h(t \u2212 r\u2217 ) emitted in the considered process, and the analytical\nfit with the first two l = 2 quasi-normal modes belonging to the frequencies\nM \u03c91 = 0.37 + i0.09 and M \u03c92 = 0.35 + i0.27. The fit becomes more accurate\nif higher order modes are taken into account, but the main contribution is\ndue to \u03c91 and \u03c92 .\n\n40\n\nrh\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n(t-r*)/M\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nFig. 1 The gravitational signal emitted when a Schwarzschild black hole is perturbed by a radially infalling particle (solid line); the analytical fit (dashed line)\nhas been obtained using a linear combination of the first two l = 2 black hole\nquasi-normal modes.\n\nThe perturbation induced on a Schwarzschild black hole by extended\nsources made up of pressureless matter was studied in [31]. It was shown\nthat in this case modes are also excited, but to a smaller extent with respect\nto the pointlike source, due to interference effects (see also [32,33]). In the\ncase of matter orbiting around a black hole, the excitation of the QNMs is in\ngeneral even smaller. Indeed, modes are significantly excited only if matter\nreaches r . 4M , i.e., if it crosses the potential barrier Vl\u00b1 (r); however, this\nis not possible if matter moves on a stable orbit, for which r \u2265 6M [34].\nAlthough these studies refer to very idealised situations, they have been\nvery useful because they showed that quasi-normal modes can be excited, and\nbecause they provided a first understanding of the mechanisms underlying\n\n\f8\n\nthe mode excitation. However, astrophysical phenomena are much more complicate, and only recently major advances in numerical techniques allowed the\nmodelling of more realistic processes involving black holes.\nBlack hole coalescence is probably the most violent process occurring in\nthe universe (after the big bang), and it is expected to be the most powerful source of gravitational waves to be detected by interferometric detectors\nVirgo and LIGO.\n\n0.04\nGSFC (R1)\nUTB (s00)\nPretorius (d16)\n\nr \u03c84 Mf\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0.004\n0.002\n-0.02\n\n0\n-0.002\n-0.004\n\n-0.04\n-100\n\n-250 -200 -150 -100\n0\n\n-50\n\n50\n\nt/Mf\n\nFig. 2 Gravitational radiation waveform emitted by two coalescing black holes\n(courtesy of the authors).\n\nSuch phenomena are very difficult to simulate numerically, because the\ntopology of the spacetime changes during the process. After nearly 15 years\nof efforts, this problem has been solved very recently by three groups [35],\nwho found, independently, the same results [36]. In their simulations, two\nSchwarzschild black holes coalesce, merge and produce a single Kerr black\nhole. The emitted gravitational signal computed in [36] is shown in Figure 2:\nafter a short merger phase the waveform is clearly dominated by the quasinormal mode oscillations. This important feature is also exhibited by the\nsignal emitted in the coalescence of rotating black holes [37].\nQuasi-normal modes excitation has also been shown to give a strong contribution to the signal emitted after the core collapse of a rotating neutron\nstar to a Kerr black hole [38]. Moreover, in [39] the gravitational emission of\na black hole perturbed by a thick, oscillating accretion disk has been studied;\nin a subsequent paper [40] it has been shown that if the disk is extremely\ndense, black hole oscillations can be excited, even though, due to the symmetry of the source, only by a small amount. All numerical simulations of\nastrophysical processes in which QNMs are excited show that the leading\ncontribution belong to the lowest frequency, l = 2 mode.\nTo conclude this Section, we should at least mention that there are also\ntheoretical studies [41],[42] on the \"excitability\" of the quasi-normal modes.\nThe main result of these studies is that a measure of the relative QNM\nexcitation, independent of the particular astrophysical process, is encoded\n\n\f9\n\nin the poles of the Green's functions associated to the Zerilli and ReggeWheeler equations. This information, combined with the knowledge of the\nexciting source, allows to determine the quasi-normal mode content of the\ngravitational signal.\n\n2.5 Other issues on quasi-normal modes\n2.5.1 Completeness\nThe quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole do not form a complete\nbasis for black hole perturbations. As shown by Leaver [41], this is due to\na branch cut in the Green's functions associated to the Zerilli and ReggeWheeler equations. Consequently, a general perturbation cannot be written\nas a combination of quasi-normal modes. In particular, it exhibit a power-law\ntail \u223c t\u22122l\u22122 [43].\n2.5.2 Stability\nThe stability of the Schwarzschild spacetime has been proved by Vishveshwara [44] and Wald [45]. Vishveshvara showed that the imaginary part, \u03c9i ,\nof the QNM frequency is always positive, and Wald proved that since \u03c9i is\nalways positive, all perturbations remain bounded.\nThe stability of Kerr black holes is still an open issue. The main problem\narises because of the existence of the ergoregion, where a perturbation can\ngrow indefinitely even though the energy remains finite. However, there are\nindications that also Kerr black holes are stable [46].\n2.5.3 Applications in string theory and in loop quantum gravity\nIn recent years, it has been suggested that black hole QNM's may play a role\nin string theory and loop quantum gravity. In 2000 Horowitz and Hubeny [47]\nproposed that the study of the black hole QNM's in anti-de Sitter spacetime\ncould be useful to determine some properties of conformal field theories. Their\nconjecture is deeply rooted in string theory and in the so-called \"AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence\". Stimulated by this work, many authors computed the QNM\neigenfrequencies in anti-de Sitter spacetime [48] (see also [49]). It is worth\nreminding that anti-de Sitter solution of Einstein's equations describes a\nuniverse with a negative cosmological constant; therefore these black holes\nshould not be considered as astrophysical objects.\nIn 2003 Dreyer and Motl [50] suggested that, in the asymptotic limit\nn \u2192 \u221e, black hole quasi-normal modes would allow to fix the value of the\n\"Immirzi parameter\", which is a key parameter in loop quantum gravity.\nFollowing this proposal, studies of the asymptotic limit of QNM [18], [28]\nhave further been developed [51].\nMore generally, inspired by these consideration in the contexts of string\ntheory and loop quantum gravity, in recent years many authors have computed the eigenfrequencies of black hole quasi-normal modes in various back-\n\n\f10\n\nground spacetimes, both in four dimensions and for higher dimensional spacetimes [52].\n3 Stellar pulsations\nStellar pulsations are a very well known phenomenon in astronomy, since they\nunderlay a variety of astrophysical processes. For instance, they are observed\nin the Sun, and a branch of solar sciences, named helioseismology, uses the\ninformation encoded in the pulsation frequencies to investigate the internal\nstructure of our star and the physical processes that occur in the interior.\nNon radial pulsations are associated to gravitational wave emission and, as\nwe shall see, the mode frequencies carry interesting information on the inner\nstructure of the emitting sources. Thus, if in the future GW-detectors will\nbe able to catch the gravitational signals emitted by pulsating stars, a new\nbranch of astrophysics will develop, the gravitational wave asteroseismology.\nThis will allow us to investigate the interior of neutron stars, where densities\nand pressures are so extreme that they are unreachable by high energy experiments on Earth. But before discussing how the equation of state (EOS) of\nmatter affects quasi-normal mode frequencies, let us preliminarily show the\nequations we need to solve to determine these frequencies. We shall discuss\nonly pulsations of a non rotating star, i.e. of stars which are described by\nstatic, spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations. The rotating\ncase is much more complicate, and an exhaustive description of the problems that arise when one is looking for the quasi-normal mode frequencies is\nbeyond the scope of this paper (see, for instance, [53] and references therein).\n3.1 Stellar perturbations of a non rotating star\nThe equations governing the adiabatic perturbations of a spherical star in\ngeneral relativity have been derived within different approaches by many\nauthors [54]-[60]. Here we shall show, as an example, the basic equations of\nthe theory of stellar perturbations as developed in [55] (see also [56] for a\ncomplete account of the theory). We start with the metric appropriate to\ndescribe a static, spherical background\nds2 = e2\u03bd (dt)2 \u2212 e2\u03c8 d\u03c6 \u2212 e2\u03bc2 (dr)2 \u2212 e2\u03bc3 (d\u03b8)2 .\n\n(11)\n\n2\n\nwhere e2\u03c8 = r2 , e2\u03bc3 = r2 sin \u03b8, and \u03bd(r) and \u03bc2 (r) have to be found by\nsolving the TOV equations of stellar structure (see for instance [8]), for an\nassigned equation of state. Matter in the star is assumed to be a perfect fluid,\nwith stress-energy tensor\nT \u03bc\u03bd = (\u01eb + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 pg \u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhere \u01eb(r) and p(r) are the fluid energy-density and the pressure, and u\u03bc are\nthe components of the four-velocity of a generic fluid element. Axisymmetric\nperturbations of the spacetime (11) can be described by the line-element\nds2 = e2\u03bd (dt)2 \u2212 e2\u03c8 (d\u03c6 \u2212 q2 dr2 \u2212 q3 d\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9dt)2 \u2212 e2\u03bc2 (dr)2 \u2212 e2\u03bc3 (d\u03b8)2 . (12)\n\n\f11\n\nIn eq. (12) there are seven unknown functions, i.e. one more than needed,\nbut the extra degree of freedom disappears when the boundary conditions of\nthe problem are fixed. As a consequence of a generic perturbation, the metric\nfunctions, (\u03bd, \u03c8, \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 , \u03c9, q2 , q3 ), and the fluid variables, (\u01eb, p, u\u03b1 ), change by\na small amount with respect to their unperturbed values, which we assume\nto be known; for instance \u03bd \u2212\u2192 \u03bd + \u03b4\u03bd, \u01eb \u2212\u2192 \u01eb + \u03b4\u01eb, and similarly for the\nremaining variables. At the same time, each element of fluid undergoes an\ninfinitesimal displacement from its equilibrium position, which is described\nby the lagrangian displacement \u03be. All perturbed quantities are functions of\nt, r and \u03b8. If we now write Einstein's equations supplemented by the hydrodynamical equations and the conservation of baryon number, expand all\ntensors in tensorial spherical harmonics and Fourier-expand the time dependent quantities, we find that, as for black holes, the perturbed equations\ndecouple into two sets, the polar and the axial, with a major difference: the\npolar equations couple the thermodynamical variables to the metric variables.\nConversely the axial perturbations do not induce fluid motion except for a\nstationary rotation; however, we shall see that the fluid plays a role, because\nit shapes the potential barrier associated to the spacetime curvature.\n3.1.1 The equations for the polar perturbations\nThe explicit expressions of the functions that describe the polar perturbations, expanded in harmonics and Fourier-expanded are\n\u03b4\u03bd = Nl (r)Pl (cos \u03b8)ei\u03c9t\n\u03b4\u03bc2 = Ll (r)Pl (cos \u03b8)ei\u03c9t\n\u03b4\u03bc3 = [Tl (r)Pl + Vl (r)Pl,\u03b8,\u03b8 ]ei\u03c9t \u03b4\u03c8 = [Tl (r)Pl + Vl (r)Pl,\u03b8 cot \u03b8]ei\u03c9t ,\n\u03b4p = \u03a0l (r)Pl (cos \u03b8)ei\u03c9t\n\u03b4\u01eb = El (r)Pl (cos \u03b8)ei\u03c9t\n\n(13)\n\n2(\u01eb + p)e\u03bd+\u03bc2 \u03ber (r, \u03b8)ei\u03c9t = Ul (r)Pl ei\u03c9t\n2(\u01eb + p)e\u03bd+\u03bc3 \u03be\u03b8 (r, \u03b8)ei\u03c9t = Wl (r)Pl,\u03b8 ei\u03c9t ,\n\nwhere Pl (cos \u03b8) are Legendre's polynomials and \u03c9 is the frequency.

(14) describe stellar perturbations\ninside the star, they are written for the variables (X, G, N, L) which are\nmetric perturbations. However, the motion of the fluid is excited by the\nperturbation and it can be shown that, once equations (14) have been solved,\nthe fluid variables, (\u03a0, E, U, W ), can be obtained in terms of the metric\nfunctions using the following equations\nWl = Tl \u2212 Vl + Ll ,\ne\u22122\u03bc2\n1\nEl = Q\u03a0l +\n(\u01eb,r \u2212 Qp,r )Ul ,\n\u03a0l = \u2212 \u03c9 2 e\u22122\u03bd Wl \u2212 (\u01eb + p)Nl ,\n2\n2(\u01eb + p)\n[(\u03c9 2 e\u22122\u03bd Wl ),r + (Q + 1)\u03bd,r (\u03c9 2 e\u22122\u03bd Wl ) + 2(\u01eb,r \u2212 Qp,r )Nl ](\u01eb + p)\n.\nUl =\n[\u03c9 2 e\u22122\u03bd (\u01eb + p) + e\u22122\u03bc2 \u03bd,r (\u01eb,r \u2212 Qp,r )]\n\nThis fact is remarkable: it shows that all information on the dynamical behaviour of a star is encoded in the gravitational field. Thus, if one is interested\nexclusively in the study of the emitted gravitational radiation, one can solve\nthe system (14) disregarding the fluid variables 3 .\nEquations (14) have to be integrated for assigned values of the frequency\nfrom r = 0, where all functions must be regular, up to the stellar surface.\nThere, the spacetime becomes vacuum and spherically symmetric, and the\nperturbed metric functions and their first derivatives have to be matched\ncontinuously with the Zerilli function that describes the polar perturbations\nof a Schwarzschild spacetime; its expression in terms of the metric functions\nis\nr\n(3M Xl (r)/n \u2212 rLl (r))\n(17)\nZl+ (r) =\nnr + 3M\n(for a detailed discussion of the boundary conditions see refs.

Their radial behaviour is completely described by a function Zl\u2212 (r),\nwhich satisfies the following Schroedinger-like equation\nd2 Zl\u2212\n+ [\u03c9 2 \u2212 Vl\u2212 (r)]Zl\u2212 = 0,\ndr\u22172\nwhere r\u2217 =\n\nRr\n0\n\ne\u2212\u03bd+\u03bc2 dr (\u03bd and \u03bc2 are unperturbed metric functions), and\n\nVl\u2212 (r) =\n3\n\n(18)\n\ne2\u03bd(r) \b\nl(l + 1)r + r3 [\u01eb(r) \u2212 p(r)] \u2212 6m(r) .\nr3\n\n(19)\n\nAfter these equations were derived, R.Ipser and R.H.Price showed that they\ncan be reduced to a fourth-order system [61].\n\n\f13\n\nThe function Zl\u2212 (r) is a combination of the axial, metric perturbations\n\u22123\n\n2\n(\u03b8),\ne3\u03c8+\u03bd\u2212\u03bc2 \u2212\u03bc3 (\u03b4q2,\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b4q3,r ) = rZl\u2212 (r)Cl+2\n\n(20)\n\n\u22123\n\n2\n(\u03b8) are Gegenbauer's polynomials [55].\nand Cl+2\nOutside the star \u01eb and p vanish and Vl\u2212 (r) reduces to the Regge-Wheeler\npotential barrier (2). From these equations we see that unlike the polar perturbations, the axial perturbations, which do not have a Newtonian counterpart, are not coupled to fluid motion. In addition, the shape of the potential\n(19) depends on \u01eb(r) and p(r), i.e. on the radial profile of the energy-density\nand of the pressure inside the star, in the equilibrium configuration.\n\n3.2 Quasi-normal modes of stars\nThe quasi-normal modes are solutions of the axial and polar equations that\nsatisfy the following boundary conditions. As for black holes, at radial infinity\nthe solution must behave as a pure outgoing wave\nZl\u00b1\n\n\u2192\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9t ,\n\nr\u2217 \u2192 +\u221e.\n\n(21)\n\nIn addition, all perturbed functions must be regular at r = 0 and have to\nmatch continuously the exterior perturbation on the stellar surface. For the\naxial perturbations the matching condition is automatically satisfied, because\neq. (18) reduces to the Regge-Wheeler equation for r \u2265 R, where R is the\nstellar radius.\nStars possess many different classes of modes. The axial quasi-normal\nmodes are pure spacetime modes and do not exist in Newtonian gravity.\nThey are named w-modes and are highly damped, i.e. the imaginary part\nof the frequency is comparable to the real part [62] and consequently the\ndamping times are small. If the star is extremely compact, the potential (19)\ninside the star becomes a well, while in the exterior it remains a barrier. If the\nwell is deep enough, it allows for the existence of one or more slowly damped\nquasi-normal modes, or s-modes; they are also said trapped modes because,\ndue to the slow damping, they are effectively trapped by the potential barrier,\nand no much radiation can leak out of the star when these modes are excited\n[63].\nIt is interesting to compare the eigenfrequencies of the axial modes of stars\nand black holes, since they are both pure spacetime modes. As an example,\nin table 2 we show the frequencies and the damping times of the first four\nl = 2, axial modes for a homogeneous star with mass M = 1.35M\u2299 and\nincreasing compactness, and for a non rotating black hole with the same\nmass. It should be mentioned that the w-mode frequencies depend upon the\nequation of state of matter in the inner core of the star and, as shown in [64],\nif detected they would allow to discriminate between the models underlying\ndifferent equations of state. Until very recently, the common belief was that\nw-modes are unlikely to be excited in astrophysical processes. However in\n2005 it has been shown that, in the collapse of a neutron star to a black hole,\nw-modes are excited soon before the black hole forms. Thus, the gravitational\n\n\f14\n\nTable 2 The characteristic frequencies and damping times of the axial quasinormal modes of a homogeneous star of mass M = 1.35 M\u2299 .

They are said g-modes, or gravity modes, if the restoring force is\ndue to buoyancy, and p-modes if it is due to pressure gradients. The mode\nfrequencies are ordered as follows\n..\u03c9gn < .. < \u03c9g1 < \u03c9f < \u03c9p1 < .. < \u03c9pn ..\nand are separated by the frequency of the fundamental mode (f -mode), which\nhas an intermediate character between g\u2212 and p\u2212 modes. In addition, general relativity predicts the existence of polar w-modes, that are very weakly\ncoupled to fluid motion and are similar to the axial w-modes [66]. Their\nfrequencies are typically higher than those of the fluid modes (g, f and p).\nThe relevance of the different modes to gravitational wave emission depends on several factors, first of all on the amount of energy which can be\nstored into a given mode. Moreover, it depends on the presence of other dissipative processes that may compete with GW-emission in removing energy\nfrom the star; for instance, neutrino diffusion or viscosity, if the oscillating\n\n\f15\n\nstar is a newly born, hot neutron star. Last, but not least, of crucial importance are the values of the mode frequencies: for instance the w-modes of\nneutron stars have typical frequencies of the order of 10 kHz or higher, far\ntoo high to be detectable by ground based interferometers in their present\nor advanced configuration.\nNumerical simulations of the most energetic astrophysical processes, like\ncore collapse to a neutron star (NS) or binary coalescence leading to NS\nformation, indicate that the mode which is most excited is the fundamental\nmode. For this reason we will now focus on this mode, discussing the information the f -mode frequency, \u03bdf , carries on the inner structure of neutron\nstars.\nIt is worth mentioning that typical values of f -mode damping times are\nof the order of a few tenths of seconds; consequently, the excitation of the\nf -mode would appear, in the Fourier transform of the gravitational signal,\nas a sharp peak. Therefore, the f -mode frequency could, in principle, be\nextracted from the detector noise by an appropriate data analysis (provided\n\u03bdf falls in the detection bandwidth of some GW-detector).\nFrom Newtonian gravity we know that the \u03bdf scales with the average\n\u0001\nM 1/2\n; as shown in [67,68], where \u03bdf has been\ndensity of the star \u03bdf \u223c R\n3\ncomputed for a variety of equations of state proposed to describe matter in\na NS, a similar scaling law holds also in general relativity.\nAt densities exceeding the equilibrium density of nuclear matter, \u03c10 =\n2.67 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 , the fluid in the inner core of a NS is basically a gas of\ninteracting nucleons. The equations of state proposed in the literature to describe this kind of matter are derived within two main, different approaches:\nnonrelativistic nuclear many-body theory (NMBT) and relativistic mean field\ntheory (RMFT); we will now show how different ways of modeling hadronic\ninteractions affect the pulsation properties of the star. In what follows we\nshall summarize the main results of a study we have done in [68], where we\nhave selected a restricted number of EOS obtained within the NMBT and\nthe RMFT approach. To describe the inner and outer crust of the NS, we\nhave used the Baym-Pethick-Sutherland EOS [69] and the Pethick-RavenhallLorenz EOS [70], respectively.\nThe EOS we choose to describe NS matter at \u03c1 > \u03c10 , are the following.\nFor the NMBT approach we select two groups of EOS: Group I, named\n(APR1 , APR2 , APRB200 , APRB120 ), and Group II, named (BBS1 ,\nBBS2 ), respectively. In both cases matter is composed of neutrons, protons,\nelectrons and muons in weak equilibrium, and the dynamics is described by\na non-relativistic Hamiltonian which includes phenomenological potentials\nthat describe two- and three-nucleon interactions. The potential are obtained\nfrom fits of existing scattering data. For all EOS the two-body potential is\nv18 , whereas the three-body potential is Urbana IX for Group I, and Urbana\nVII for Group II.\nA first major difference between the two groups is that in Group I\nthe ground state energy is calculated using variational techniques [71,72],\nwhereas in Group II is calculated using G-matrix perturbation theory [73].\nThere are also differences among the EOS in each group:\n\n\f16\n\n\u2013 Group I\nAPR2 is an improved version of the APR1 model. In APR1 nucleonnucleon potentials describe interactions between nucleons in their center\nof mass frame, in which the total momentum P vanishes. In the APR2 the\ntwo-nucleon potential is modified including relativistic corrections which\narise from the boost to a frame in which P 6= 0, up to order P2 /m2 .\nThese corrections are necessary to use the nucleon-nucleon potential in\na locally inertial frame associated to the star. As a consequence of this\nchange, the three-body potential also needs to be modified in a consistent\nfashion.\nThe EOS APRB200 and APRB120 are the same as APR2 up to \u223c 4\u03c10 ,\nbut at higher density there is a phase of deconfined quark matter described within the MIT bag model. The mass of the strange quark is\nassumed to be ms = 150 MeV, the coupling constant describing quarks\ninteraction is set to \u03b1s = 0.5, and the value of the bag constant is 200\nMeV/fm3 for APRB200 and 120 MeV/fm3 for APRB120 . We will discuss in some more detail quark matter in the next section. The phase\ntransition from nuclear matter to quark matter is described requiring the\nfulfillment of Gibbs conditions, leading to the formation of a mixed phase,\nand neglecting surface and Coulomb effects [71,74]. Thus, these stars are\nhybrid stars.\n\u2013 Group II\nThe main difference between the equations of state BBS1 and BBS2 is\nthat in BBS2 strange heavy baryons (\u03a3 \u2212 and \u039b0 ) are allowed to form in\nthe core. Neither BBS1 nor BBS2 include relativistic corrections.\nAs representative of the RMFT, we choose the EOS named G240 . Matter\ncomposition includes leptons and the complete octet of baryons (nucleons,\n\u03a3 0,\u00b1 , \u039b0 and \u039e \u00b1 ). Hadron dynamics is described in terms of exchange of\none scalar and two vector mesons. It should be reminded that in this case,\nthe EOS is obtained within the mean field approximation [75].\nFor any of the above EOS we have solved the TOV equations for different\nvalues of the central density, finding the equilibrium configurations. Then, for\neach EOS and for each equilibrium model, we have solved the equations of\nstellar perturbations finding the f -mode frequency, \u03bdf . The results are shown\nin Fig. 3 where we plot \u03bdf as a function of the mass, up to the maximum mass\nallowed by each EOS. From this picture we learn the following. Comparing\nthe values of \u03bdf for APR1 and APR2 we immediately see that the relativistic\ncorrections and the associated redefinition of the three-body potential, which\nimprove the Hamiltonian of APR2 with respect to APR1 , play a relevant\nrole, leading to a systematic difference of about 150 Hz in the mode frequency. Conversely, the presence of quark matter in the star inner core (EOS\nAPRB200 and APRB120 ) does not seem to significantly affect the pulsation\nproperties of the star. We also see that the frequencies corresponding to the\nBBS1 and APR1 models, which are very close at M <\n\u223c 1.4 M\u2299 , diverge for\nlarger masses. This behavior can be traced back to the different treatments\nof three-nucleon interactions, whose role in shaping the EOS becomes more\nand more important as the star mass (and central density) increases: while\nthe variational approach of ref. [71] used to derive the EOS APR1 naturally\n\n\f17\n\nf-mode frequency\n2.6\n2.5\n2.4\n2.3\n\n\u03bdf ( KHz )\n\n2.2\n2.1\n2\n1.9\n\nAPR1\nAPR2\nAPRB200\nAPRB120\nBBS1\nBBS2\nG240\n\n1.8\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nM/Mo\nFig. 3 The frequency of the fundamental mode is plotted as a function of the mass\nof the star for the selected EOS (see text).\n\nallows for inclusion of the three-nucleon potential appearing in the Hamiltonian, in G-matrix perturbation theory used to derive the EOS BBS1 the\nthree-body potential has to be replaced with an effective two-nucleon potential, obtained by averaging over the position of the third particle [76].\nThe transition to hyperonic matter, predicted by the BBS2 model, produces a considerable softening of the EOS, and leads to stable NS configurations of very low mass (= 1.218 M\u2299 ). As a consequence of the softening of\nthe EOS, the average density increases and so does the f -mode frequency,\nwhich is significantly higher than that obtained for other EOS for the same\nmass.\nIt is also interesting to compare the f -mode frequencies corresponding\nto models BBS2 (derived within the RMFT approach) and G240 (derived\nusing the NMBT approach), as they both predict the occurrence of heavy\nstrange baryons, but are obtained from different theoretical approaches. The\nbehavior of \u03bdf shown in Fig. 3 directly reflects the relations between mass and\ncentral density; indeed, for a given mass, larger central density correspond\nto smaller radii, and therefore to larger average density. Consequently, we\ncan say that higher frequencies correspond to larger central densities \u03c1c . For\nexample, the NS configurations of mass 1.2 M\u2299 correspond to \u03c1c \u223c 7 * 1014\ng/cm3 for G240 , and to a larger central density, \u03c1c \u223c 2 * 1015 g/cm3 for\nBBS2 . On the other hand, the G240 model requires a central density of \u223c\n2.5*1015 g/cm3 to reach a mass of \u223c 1.55 M\u2299 and a value of \u03bdf equal to\nthat of the BBS2 model.\nFrom the above discussion we see that the frequency of the fundamental mode carries interesting information on the different ways of modeling\nhadronic interactions.\n\n\f18\n\n3.3 Can a star be made of quarks?\nAnother interesting possibility is that a compact star is a strange star, namely\none that, except for a thin outer crust, is entirely made of a degenerate gas\nof up, down and strange quarks. That such stars may exist, was suggested by\nWitten many years ago [77]; since then, from time to time the observation\nof a very compact (or what seems to be a very compact) object revives the\nquestion whether strange stars can actually exist. Thus, it is interesting to\nsee whether gravitational waves would be able to provide an answer to this\nquestion. For this reason in [78] we computed the f -mode eigenfrequency\nof strange stars, modeled using the MIT bag model [79]. It may be noted\nthat, due to the complexity of the fundamental theory of strong interactions\nbetween quarks (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics, or QCD), theoretical studies\nof strange stars are necessarily based on models, and the MIT bag model\nis one of the most used in the literature. According to such model, quarks\noccur in color neutral clusters confined to a finite region of space \u2013 the bag\n\u2013 the volume of which is limited by the pressure of the QCD vacuum (the\nbag constant B); in addition, the residual interactions between quarks are\nassumed to be weak, and therefore are treated in low order perturbation\ntheory in the color coupling constant \u03b1s . Thus, the parameters of the model\nare the masses of up, down and strange quarks, \u03b1s and the bag constant B.\nFrom the Particle Data Book we learn that the mass of the up and down\nquarks are of the order of few MeV, negligible with respect to that of the\nstrange quark, the value of which is in the ranges (80 \u2212 155) MeV. The value\nof the coupling constant \u03b1s is constrained by the results of hadron collision\nexperiments to range within (0.4 \u2212 0.6).\nIn early applications of the MIT bag model B, \u03b1s and ms were adjusted\nto fit the measured properties of light hadrons (spectra, magnetic moments\nand charge radii). According to these studies B was shown to range from\n57.5 MeV/fm3 [80] to 351.7 MeV/fm3 [81]; however, the requirement that\nstrange quark matter be absolutely stable at zero temperature and pressure\nimplies that B cannot exceed the maximum value Bmax \u2248 95 MeV/fm3 [82].\nFor values of B exceeding Bmax , a star entirely made of deconfined quarks\nis not stable, and quark matter can only occupy a fraction of the available\nvolume as in the models APRB200 and APRB120 considered above. Thus, if\nwe want to study bare strange stars we need to restrict the values of B in the\nrange \u2208 (57 \u2212 95) MeV/fm3 . In our analysis we have systematically explored\nthe following range of parameters\nB \u2208 (57 \u2212 95) MeV/fm3 ,\n(22)\ncomputing the corresponding stellar configurations up to the maximum mass,\nand the corresponding f -mode frequencies. The results are summarized in\nfigure 4. There we plot \u03bdf as a function of the mass of the star, both for\nstrange stars and for the neutron/hybrid stars described in the previous\nsection. The shaded region covers the range of parameters of the MIT bag\nmodel (22).\nFrom figure 4 we can extract the following information. First of all strange\nstars cannot emit gravitational waves with \u03bdf . 1.7 kHz, for any value of the\nms \u2208 (80 \u2212 155) MeV,\n\n\u03b1s \u2208 (0.4 \u2212 0.6),\n\n\f19\n\n3.2\n\nNeutron stars\n+\nStrange stars\n\n3\n\n2.8\n\nAPR2\nAPRB200\nAPRB120\nBBS1\nBBS2\nG240\n\n\u03bdf ( kHz )\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n2\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nM/Mo\n\nFig. 4 The frequency of the fundamental mode is plotted as a function of the\nmass of the star, for neutron/hybrid stars (continuous lines) and for strange stars\nmodeled using the MIT bag model, spanning the set of parameters indicated in\n(22) (dashed region).\n\nmass in the range we consider. Note that 1.8 M\u2299 is the maximum mass above\nwhich no stable strange star can exist. There is a small range of frequency\nwhere neutron/hybrid stars are indistinguishable from strange stars; however,\nthere is a large frequency region where only strange stars can emit. For\ninstance if M = 1.4 M\u2299 , a signal with \u03bdf & 2 kHz would belong to a strange\nstar. Even if we do not know the mass of the star (as it is often the case for\nisolated pulsars) the knowledge of \u03bdf allows to gain information about the\nsource nature; indeed, if \u03bdf & 2.2 kHz, apart from a very narrow region of\nmasses where stars with hyperons would emit (EOS BBS2 and G240 ), we\ncan reasonably exclude that the signal is emitted by a neutron star.\nIn addition, it is possible to show that if a signal emitted by an oscillating\nstrange star would be detected, since \u03bdf is an increasing function of the bag\nconstant B it would be possible to set constraints on B much more stringent\nthan those provided by the available experimental data [78].\n4 Are we ready for gravitational wave asteroseismology?\nIn this section we want to discuss whether we are in a position to establish\nwhat is (or are) the equation(s) of state appropriate to describe matter at\nsupranuclear densities, using gravitational wave signals. This is of course a\nfundamental question, because the energies prevailing in the inner core of\nneutron stars are unaccessible to high energy experiments on Earth.\nThe answer is, unfortunately, negative, essentially for two reasons. The\nfirst is that ground based interferometers do not have, at present, sufficiently\n\n\f20\n\nhigh sensitivity at frequencies in the range \u223c 1.5 \u2212 3 kHz, typical for \u03bdf . Feasibility studies of interferometric, high frequency detectors have been considered in recent years [83], and high frequency, wide-band, resonant detectors\nare under study [84]; however, if we restrict to Virgo or LIGO in their present\nconfiguration, to detect a signal emitted by a NS pulsating in the f -mode in\nour Galaxy, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5, the energy stored into the mode\nshould be Ef \u2212mode \u223c 6 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 c2 . In order to understand whether it is\nplausible that the fundamental mode is excited to such an extent, we can refer\neither to the results of numerical simulations, or to astrophysical data. Numerical simulations of gravitational collapse show that the amount of energy\nreleased in gravitational waves is in the range EGW tot \u223c [10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126 ] M\u2299 c2\n[85]. Although computed waveforms show that the f -mode is excited, at\npresent there is no conclusive indication on the fraction of EGW tot which\nmay go into that mode, since it depends on the initial conditions and on the\nphysical assumptions that are made in modeling the collapse. Just to mention one, usually numerical simulations assume axisymmetric collapse, but\nin the non axisymmetric case energy released in GWs may be higher.\nThus, we can only say that Ef \u2212mode \u223c 6 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 c2 is not totally\nunreasonable. Unfortunately, gravitational collapse is a rare event (about 3\nevents every hundred years, per galaxy), and if we restrict to our Galaxy\nchances to detect one in our lifetime are not too high.\nThe f -mode may also be excited in a cold, old neutron star as a consequence of a glitch. Glitches are sudden changes in the rotation frequency of\nthe neutron star crust. They are observed in many pulsars and are thought\nto be related to quakes occurring in the solid structures such as the crust,\nthe superfluid vortices and, perhaps, the lattice of quark matter in the stellar\ncore [86,87,88]. The rotational energy released in a glitch is \u2206E \u2248 I\u03a9\u2206\u03a9,\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the star, and typical spin variations are\n\u2206\u03a9/\u03a9 \u2248 10\u22126 \u221210\u22128 . For the glitches observed in the Crab and Vela pulsars\nobservations give \u2206E \u2243 2 * 10\u221213 M\u2299 c2 and \u2206E \u2243 3 * 10\u221212 M\u2299 c2 , respectively. As before, we do not know which fraction of \u2206E goes in the f -mode\nexcitation; in any event being \u2206E so small, we can conclude that there is\nno hope to detect anything like this with the detectors that are actually in\noperation.\nThe second reason why we are far from being able to infer the EOS of\nmatter in the inner core of a NS using gravitational waves, is that the EOS\nproposed in the literature only loosely constrain the dynamics of nuclear\nmatter. This statement can be made more clear by the following example.\nSince from Newtonian gravity we know that \u03bdf scales as the square root\nof the average density, we expect a similar relationqto hold also in general\nM\nrelativity. Indeed, a linear relation between \u03bdf and R\n3 has been obtained\nin [67], fitting the data referring to stars modeled with a large set of EOS. In\n[68] a similar fit has been found using the same EOS considered in previous\nsections; since the two fits are similar, in what follows we shall explicitly use\nour fit:\nr\nM\n, a = 0.79 \u00b1 0.09, b = 33 \u00b1 2,\n(23)\n\u03bdf = a + b\nR3\n\n\f21\n\nq\nM\nwhere a is in kHz and b in km*kHz. The fit is plotted in figure 5 versus R\n3,\ntogether with the f -mode frequencies corresponding to the stellar models\nconsidered in figure 3.

We also\nplot the fit given in eq. (23)\n\na function of the stellar compactness M/R as follows\n\u03bdp1 =\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nM\n1\na+b\n,\nM\nR\n\na = \u22121.5 \u00b1 0.8,\n\nb = 79 \u00b1 4,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere a and b are in km*kHz. In these fits, frequencies are expressed in kHz,\nmasses and radii in km.\nLet us now consider a star belonging to the EOS APR2 , with mass\nM = 1.4 M\u2299 and radius R = 11.58 km. Let us assume that, as a consequence\nof some astrophysical process, both the fundamental mode and the first pmode are excited and that the emitted gravitational wave has been detected.\nWith the detected values of \u03bdf and \u03bdp1 (which we know to be \u03bdf = 1.983 kHz,\n\u03bdp = 6.164 kHz) we could plot the fits (23) and (24) in the (R, M )-plane,\nand we would find what is shown in figure 6: the two curves intersect in a\npoint which corresponds to M = 1.30 M\u2299 , R = 11.36 km; consequently, we\nwould be able to estimate the values of the mass and of the radius with an\nerror of 7% and 2%, respectively. This would be great, but unfortunately,\nthe fit comes with error bars. If, for instance we plot the curve referring to\nthe f -mode, and we show the entire region where the parameters a and b\ncan vary (the dashed region in figure 7), we see that the error bar induces a\n\n\f22\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\nR (km)\n\n12\n\n\u25cf\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n\u2212\u2212 \u03bdf\n\n8\n\n\u2212\u2212 \u03bdp1\n\n7\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nM/Mo\n\nFig. 6 The fits (23) and (24) are plotted in the R \u2212 M -plane, assuming the mode\nfrequencies \u03bdf = 1.983 kHz and \u03bdp = 6.164 kHz have been identified in a detected\nsignal. The black dot corresponds to the true values of the mass and radius of the\nemitting star.\n\nvery large error on R; so large indeed that, even knowing the mass, we would\nestimate R with an error of the order of 18%.\nTherefore, for the time being, we can only say that gravitational wave\nasteroseismology will become possible when GW-detectors will become more\nsensitive to the high frequency region, and when nuclear matter studies will\nput tighter constraints on the parameters that characterize the equation of\nstate of superdense matter.\nSince science always looks forward for expanding the horizon of knowledge, we are confident that one day this will be possible.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n\nwww.ligo.caltech.edu; www.virgo.infn.it\nKokkotas K.D. and Schmidt B.G. 1999 Living Rev.
