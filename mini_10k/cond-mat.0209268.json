Mode-coupling theory has proved\nquite successful for supercooled liquids at higher temperatures, before activated dynamics\nmust be accounted for explicitly.[1, 2, 3, 4] It was Goldstein who first related the behaviour\nof glass formers to the underlying potential energy surface (PES). [5] In this approach, the\ndynamics are separated into vibrational motion about a minimum on the PES and transitions between local minima or 'inherent structures'.[6, 7] The PES is partitioned into basins\nof attraction surrounding the local minima, where a basin of attraction is defined as a set\n\n\f2\nof points that lead to the same minimum along steepest-descent pathways. Recently, it has\nbeen possible to establish connections between the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics\nof finite systems and the PES in some detail.[8]\nFollowing Angell,[9, 10, 11] glass-forming liquids can be classified as strong or fragile.\nFragile systems exhibit non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of transport properties such\nas the diffusion constant, usually accompanied by a significant heat capacity peak at the glass\ntransition. In contrast, strong systems exhibit Arrhenius dynamics and small or negligible\nchanges in the thermodynamic properties at the glass transition.\nComputer simulation based on standard molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC)\ntechniques, has played a significant role in the testing and development of models for supercooled liquids and glasses.[12] Interest in more direct connections to the PES has recently\nincreased, with Sastry, Debenedetti and Stillinger[13] characterising 'landscape-influenced'\nand 'landscape-dominated' regimes for a binary Lennard-Jones system, in agreement with\nthe instantaneous normal modes picture of Donati, Sciortino and Tartaglia.[14] Recently, a\nkinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) approach[15, 16, 17] was used to provide an alternative view of\nthe dynamics.[18]\nIn the present contribution we focus on some properties of the energy landscape in a\nbinary Lennard-Jones (BLJ) mixture, namely, the effect of the density on the local minima\nsampled as a function of temperature. This topic has been previously considered by Malandro et al.[19, 20] and Sastry.[21, 22] In the former studies the volume dependence of the\nlocal minima appearances and disappearances were examined. Similar results were found\nby Heuer[23]. Sastry also analysed the relationship between fragility and the PES and how\nthe former depends on the bulk density. One feature of the BLJ system is that the vibrational contribution to the entropy, within the harmonic approximation, decreases with the\npotential energy. Furthermore, Sastry found a limiting density, \u03c1l = 1.08 in reduced units,\nwhich defines a limit of stability separating spatially heterogeneous structures (below \u03c1l )\nfrom more homogeneous structures (above \u03c1l ). \u03c1l was also interpreted as a density limit to\nglass formation. Here, we concentrate on this limit and consider the glass and supercooled\nliquid structures in more detail as a function of density.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe model we used is a binary mixture of N = 256 atoms in a cubic box with periodic\nboundary conditions, containing 205 (\u223c 80%) A atoms and 51 (\u223c 20%) B atoms interacting\naccording to a Lennard-Jones pair potential of the form\nV\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n= 4\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \uf8f0\nr\u03b1\u03b2\n\n!12\n\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212\nr\u03b1\u03b2\n\n!6 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb,\n\n(1)\n\nr\u03b1\u03b2 being the distance between particles \u03b1 and \u03b2. The values of the Lennard-Jones parameters are \u01ebAA = 1.0, \u01ebBB = 0.5, \u01ebAB = 1.5, \u03c3AA = 1.0, \u03c3BB = 0.88 and \u03c3AB = 0.8.[24] The\nunits of distance, energy, temperature, pressure, and time were taken as \u03c3AA , \u01ebAA , \u01ebAA /kB\n\u22123\n(kB is the Boltzmann constant), \u01ebAA \u03c3AA\nand \u03c3AA (m/\u01ebAA )1/2 , with m the mass of both A and\n\u22123\nB atoms. The initial density was 1.2\u03c3AA\nwith a fixed cutoff of 2.5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 along with the mini-\n\nmum image convention. We truncated and shifted the potential with a quadratic function,\nso that the energy and its first derivative are continuous at the cutoff value.[13, 25]\nThis BLJ model has been extensively studied in the glasses community, as it does not\ncrystallise on the molecular dynamics time scale.[12, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29,\n30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] However, we have recently found that there are\ncrystalline minima for this system, based on face-centred-cubic A atoms with trigonal or\nsquare prismatic B-A coordination.[41] Previous work has shown that this system exhibits\na significant degree of non-Arrhenius behaviour at low temperatures, i.e. it is fragile in\nAngell's terminology.[24, 33, 34, 35]\nMicrocanonical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out, where the classical\nequations of motion were integrated using a Verlet algorithm. We employed 105 equilibration steps, followed by 106 data collection steps with a time step of 0.003 in reduced\nunits.[40]\nIn order to study the local minima the instantaneous system configuration was quenched,\nevery 1000th configuration, to locate a minimum. Quenching was performed using a modified version of Nocedal's limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS)\nalgorithm.[8, 42, 43] Each quench was finished using a few eigenvector-following steps[44, 45]\nto converge the root-mean-square gradient below 10\u22127 reduced units, employing full diagonalisation of the analytical Hessian matrix to ensure that the stationary points have the\ncorrect Hessian index (the number of negative eigenvalues). In this manner we generated a\n\n\f4\nsample of minima at density \u03c1 = 1.2.\nFor each local minimum, the density of the system was changed by 0.02 in reduced units.\nTo do this we changed the box length to give the density required, without rescaling the\ncoordinates of the atoms in the box. Then, the potential energy was reminimized using the\nmethods described above. This process was repeated in order to follow the properties of the\nminima over a wide range of density.\nWe have analysed the behaviour of the local minima at densities in the range 0.6 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264\n1.3, and for three different initial kinetic equipartition temperatures 1.0, 0.5 and 0.4. It is\nknown for this system that the glass transition temperature, Tg , occurs between 0.5 and\n0.4.[13, 18, 32, 40]\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section we present the results obtained for the behaviour of the local minima at\ndifferent temperatures and densities. At the initial density \u03c1 = 1.2, the number of different\nlocal minima that we found from the 1000 instantaneous configurations, Nmin , was 1000,\n991, and 268 at T = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively. These values reflect the increasing\nresidence times in the local minima as the temperature is decreased, with a dramatic fall in\nNmin below Tg . We found that Nmin is basically independent of the density in the range of\ndensities studied.\nWe have also evaluated the mean potential energy for the local minima as a function\nof density for three different initial samples at T = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.4. In Fig. 1 we can see\nhow the lowest value of the energy occurs around \u03c1 = 1.2 for each temperature. However,\nat T = 0.4 the minimum of the curve is slightly displaced to higher density, namely, to\n\u03c1 = 1.22.\nA clear change of slope appears in Fig. 1 (the system is mechanically unstable) at \u03c1l = 1.06\nfor each temperature, and for \u03c1 < \u03c1l the mean potential energy is practically independent\nof T and increases as the density decreases.\nAnother interesting property is the variation of the pressure with density (Fig. 1). In this\ncase, the pressure, P , was calculated using the virial equation[46]\n\n\f5\n\nP V = (N \u2212 1)T +\n\n1 XX\n<\nrij * Fij >,\n3\ni j>i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V = N/\u03c1 is the volume of the supercell, N is the number of atoms, rij = ri \u2212 rj and\nFij is the force on the ith particle due to jth particle. A factor N \u2212 1 appears because of\nmomentum conservation. We used T = 0 to calculate the pressure for the local minima.\nThe lowest value of P is reached for each temperature around \u03c1l = 1.06. This value is\nvery close to Sastry's result of \u03c1l = 1.08[21] (his supercell contained 204 A atoms and 52 B\natoms). For \u03c1 < 1, the mean pressure is practically independent of the temperature. Fig. 1\nalso shows that the pressure is nearly zero at densities corresponding to the lowest values of\nthe mean energy.\nThe geometric mean normal mode frequency at each local minimum is\n\u03bd=\n\n3N\n\u22123\nY\n\n(\u03bdi )1/(3N \u22123) ,\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the \u03bdi are obtained by diagonalising the Hessian matrix. A mean angular frequency,\naveraged over all the local minima, can be defined as\n\n< \u03c9 >= 2\u03c0 < \u03bd >,\n\n(4)\n\nand this quantity is plotted in Fig. 2. The frequencies are important for dynamics because\nthey appear in the usual transition state theory rate constant for barrier crossing. If we\nalso use the information obtained in Fig. 1 we can see that for \u03c1 > 1.2, which corresponds\nto positive pressures (compressed regime), < \u03c9 > increases with energy, in agreement with\nSastry.[22] However, between \u03c1 \u223c 1.2 and \u03c1l = 1.06, which corresponds to negative pressures\n(stretched regime), we see the opposite behaviour, i.e. < \u03c9 > decreases as the density\ndecreases. Then, it increases again to reach a constant value of 13 below \u03c1 \u223c 1.0 independent\nof T .\nWe have also calculated the mean value of the distance between all pairs of local minima\nsampled:\n\ndij =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\nN\n2\n1 X\nrik \u2212 rjk ,\nN k=1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere i and j indicates the ith and jth local minima. It is clear from Fig. 2 that this quantity\nincreases with the initial temperature used to generate the samples and with decreasing\n\n\f6\ndensity. On the other hand, the initial MD trajectories sample the PES less extensively at\nlow temperature for the same simulation time. In the regime \u03c1l = 1.06 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1.3 < dij >\ndoes not change much, while below \u03c1l = 1.06 it increases steadily.\nThe above results were checked by studying the partial radial distribution functions\n(PRDF) for all the local minima sampled,[33]\nN\u03b1\nN\u03b1 X\nX\nV\n\u03b4(r \u2212 |rij |)\ng\u03b1\u03b1 (r) =\nN\u03b1 (N\u03b1 \u2212 1) i j6=i\n\n*\n\nand\nV\ngAB (r) =\nNA NB\n\n*N N\nB\nA X\nX\ni\n\nj\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u03b4(r \u2212 |rij |) ,\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b4(r) is the delta function. In Fig. 3 we show the PRDF for A particles as a function\nof the density for reoptimised local minima generated from the run at T = 1.\nThe first peak is the highest in the PRDF for all densities, indicating that the AA\ncorrelation takes place at the first coordination shell. However, as the density is reduced\nfrom \u03c1 = 1.3, this peak is slightly displaced to longer distance, i.e. it reflects the lower\ndensity, and then reaches a maximum value at density \u03c1l = 1.06. Below this density, the\nsystem shows the opposite trend due to the formation of voids and fractures,[21, 47, 48, 49],\nallowing the AA distances to relax back closer to their ideal value.\nSimilar behaviour is exhibited in gAB in Fig. 3. The strong attractive interaction between\nA and B particles is reflected in the first peak. However, gBB in Fig. 4 exhibits some\nnew features. The weaker attractive interaction between B particles is reflected in the\nintensities of the peaks. The BB correlation takes place mainly in the first, second and\nthird coordination shells, but for \u03c1 = 0.6 the first coordination shell is more important.\nFurthermore, a clear splitting appears in the second peak, indicating that the local structure\nfor B particles is more ordered at low density. This is because at low density, with the\nformation of voids in the structure, a dense packing appears. A similar signature is known\nat high pressure.[39, 50]\nSastry et al.[47] suggested that the limiting density, in our case \u03c1l = 1.06, is a lower limit\nto glass formation. In order to elucidate this signature we compare the PRDF averaged over\nreoptimised local minima initially sampled at T = 0.5 and T = 0.4. The results in Fig. 5\nreveal a clear difference between the two samples for densities above \u03c1l = 1.06. For the lower\ntemperature, corresponding to the glassy phase, the structure is more ordered. However,\n\n\f7\nbelow \u03c1l = 1.06 the PRDF are nearly the same, so it is not possible to differentiate between\nthe glass and supercooled liquid structures in this way. Similar behaviour is exhibited by gBB\nin Fig. 6. However, gAB , illustrated in Fig. 5, does not separate the two phases, indicating\nthat the A-B disorder is similar in the glass and the supercooled liquid.\nThe formation of a void in one particular local minimum sampled at T = 1 is shown in\nFigure 7. The void starts to form at the limiting density \u03c1l = 1.06 and then increases when\nthe density is reduced further.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have considered the effect of the density on local minima of a binary\nLennard-Jones system sampled at kinetic equipartition temperatures T = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.4.\nA limiting density is found around \u03c1l = 1.06, below which fractures and voids begin to form.\nThe latter features cause discontinuities in various properties, in agreement with Sastry's\nresults.[21]\nIn the regime \u03c1l = 1.06 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1.3 the main peaks in the PRDF for AA, BB, and AB\nparticles are slightly displaced to longer distance relative to \u03c1 = 1.3. Below \u03c1l , fractures and\nvoids begin to form and the main peaks then move in the opposite direction. In the PRDF\nfor BB particles at low density, a clear splitting of the second peak appears as a consequence\nof a more ordered local structure. Furthermore, below \u03c1l , the PRDF for AA, BB and AB\nparticles for the samples generated at T = 0.5 and T = 0.4 are indistinguishable, so it is not\npossible to differentiate between the glass and supercooled liquid structures at low density\nin this way.\nThe lowest value of the mean pressure also occurs around \u03c1l for each temperature. Below\nthis density, the mean potential energy changes almost linearly with \u03c1 due to a transition\nfrom homogeneous local minima to inhomogeneous structures with voids.[47] The minimum\nof the mean energy potential as a function of the density corresponds to a pressure close to\nzero.\nOn the other hand, at positive pressure (compressed region), we found that the mean\nnormal mode frequencies increase with energy but, at negative pressure (stretched region),\nthe opposite behaviour appears. At lower density, the mean frequency is practically the\nsame for samples obtained at each temperature, and reaches a limiting value as the density\n\n\f8\ndecreases.\nThe initial MD trajectories sample fewer local minima at low temperature, as expected.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nJ.
