Introduction\nThe ability to isolate and embed single- and multi-layer graphene in double gated\nstructures is paving the way to reveal unique electronic properties of these systems\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The ability to change the voltages applied\nto a nano-fabricated top gate and to the back-gate offers the possibility to gain local\ncontrol of the charge density and of imposing locally a perpendicular electric field. This\ndevice configuration was used recently to show how the band structure of graphene-based\nmaterials can be tuned continuously [8, 12]. In particular, bilayer graphene exhibits an\nelectric field induced insulating state due to the opening of a gap between valence and\nconduction band [8], and in trilayers, which are semi-metals, the band-overlap can be\nincreased substantially [12]. Cleverly designed top gates on a graphene single layer have\nalso been used successfully for engineering p-n junctions [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], necessary for\nthe investigation of Klein tunneling [1, 3, 4], and to attempt the fabrication of controlled\nquantum dots [15, 16]. Key to the fabrication of top gated structures is the ability to\ndeposit good quality thin gate oxides, with high breakdown field and low leakage current.\nHere, after reviewing the relevance of double gated devices on the electric field\nmodulation of the band structure of double and triple layer graphene, we discuss in some\ndetails technological aspects related to the properties of the SiO2 layers used as gate\ninsulators. In particular, we discuss how we can routinely achieve high breakdown fields\nin electron-gun evaporated thin SiO2 films (15 nm), comparable to the breakdown fields\nof thermally grown SiO2 , which is surprising given that SiO2 deposited by evaporation\nwas long believed to be a poor quality insulator. To unveil the reasons behind the\ngood insulating quality of our evaporated SiO2 films, we conducted a statistical study\nof leakage current and breakdown voltage in capacitors, where two metallic electrodes\nare separated by a SiO2 layer fabricated in different ways. We demonstrate that if SiO2\nand top gate metal electrodes are deposited subsequently without exposing the SiO2 to\nair, the electrical performance of electron-gun evaporated SiO2 is comparable to that of\nthermally grown SiO2 . In contrast, exposure to air of the SiO2 layer before deposition\nof the counter-electrode leads to much worse insulating characteristics. Our findings\nindicate that extrinsic degradation \u2013probably due to the absorption of humidity- has\nlimited in the past the insulating quality of electron-gun evaporated SiO2 .\n2. Device and fabrication\nSingle and few layer graphene flakes used for the device fabrication were obtained\nby micro-mechanical cleavage of natural graphite crystals, and by their subsequent\ntransfer onto a highly doped Silicon substrate (acting as a gate) covered by a 285 nm\nthick thermally grown SiO2 layer. The thickness of the graphene layers can be simply\nidentified by analyzing the shift in intensity in the RGB green channel relative to the\nsubstrate (i.e. Relative Green Shift) [8, 12, 14, 17, 18]. A plot of the relative green shift,\nas extracted from optical microscope images of various samples taken with a digital\n\n\fDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n3\n\ncamera, exhibits plateaus corresponding to the discrete thickness values -see Fig. 1a.\nSubsequent transport measurements (quantum Hall effect, resistance dependence on a\nperpendicular electric field, etc.) confirm the validity of this optical method (Fig. 1b).\nThe fabrication of nanostructures is accomplished by conventional electron-beam\nlithography. Metallic contacts and top gates were deposited by electron-gun evaporation,\nrespectively of Ti/Au (10/25nm thick with a back ground pressure of 9 \u2217 10\u22127 torr) for\ncontacts and SiO2 /Ti/Au (15/10/25nm thick with a back ground pressure of 3 \u2217 10\u22127\ntorr) for top gates, followed by lift-off. We took special care to fabricate all the ohmic\ncontacts within 60 nm from the edges of the top gated areas, so that two probe resistance\nmeasurements are dominated by the resistance of the double gated region[19]. All\ntransport measurements in double gated devices (see Fig. 1c) were made using a lock-in\ntechnique (excitation frequency: 19.3Hz), in the linear transport regime, at temperatures\nranging from 300 mK up to 150K.\nTo understand why, contrary to expectations, we manage to achieve high breakdown\nfield in thin, electron-beam evaporated SiO2 films, we conducted a macroscopic study of\nthe breakdown characteristics on two types of capacitor test structures. The first -which\nwe refer to as type A- is characterized by subsequent evaporation of SiO2 /Ti/Au without\nbreaking the vacuum in between the deposition of the different materials. For the second\n-type B SiO2 - we exposed the device to ambient for one hour after the SiO2 deposition,\nbefore evaporating the Ti/Au counter electrode. The breakdown test measurements\nwere made with a Keithley-2400 source-meter on more than 130 different capacitors\n(with three different surface areas: 125 \u00d7 115\u03bcm2 , 175 \u00d7 150\u03bcm2 and 215 \u00d7 195\u03bcm2 ).\n\n3. Transport experiments in double gated few layer graphene devices\nThe measurement configuration used for double gated devices is shown in Fig. 1c. A\nfinite voltage applied to either one of the gates (back or top gate) changes the position\nof the Fermi level in the corresponding gated region of the graphene layer, by an amount\ncorresponding to the induced charge density. In addition, by biasing the two gate electrodes with opposite polarity, a large external electric field applied perpendicular to the\nlayer is generated, which is equal to Eex = (Vbg \u2212 Vtg )/dtot (dtot = 15 + 285nm is the\ntotal SiO2 thickness). In this device configuration, we can monitor the evolution of the\nin plane transport properties for each few layer graphene device as a function of Eex .\nFig. 1d, e and f show the typical behavior of the square resistance measured respectively in double gated single (d), double (e) and triple (f) layer graphene, when sweeping\nthe top gate, while keeping the back gate at a fixed potential. It is apparent that the\noverall electric field dependence of Rsq is markedly distinct for graphene layers of differmax\nent thickness. In all cases, the resistance exhibits a maximum (Rsq\n) whose value and\nposition in gate voltage depend on the voltage applied to the gate on which a fixed potential is applied during the measurement. At Eex = 0 V/m we find that for single and\nmax\nbilayer graphene Rsq\n\u223c 6K\u03a9, close to a conductance per square of 4e2 /h, as expected,\n\n\f4\n\nDouble-gated graphene-based devices\nVtg\nV\n\n3L\n0.18\n\n2\n\n2L\n\nG(4e2/h)\n\n0.12\n\n1L\n\n1L\n\nAu\nAu\n\nAu\n\nTi\n\nTi\n\nIbias\n\nTi\n\nSiO 2\n\ngraphene\n\n1\n\nSiO2\n\n0.06\n\nVbg\n\np-doped Si\n\n0.00\n0\n\n(a)\n\n20\n\n60\n\n0\n\n80\n\n(b)\n\nFlake counter\n\n5\n\n1L\n\n20V\n\n40V\n\n0V\n\n-20V\n\nVbg\n\n-20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n40\n\nVbg (V)\n\n150\n\n2L\n\n100\n\n3\n\nVbg\n-40V\n\n(d)\n\n0V\n\nVtg (V)\n\n2\n\n0V\n\n-4\n\n(e)\n\n+30V\n\n4\n\n+40V\n\n-25V\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n+20V\n\n+50V\n\n-25V\n0\n\n+10V\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n-2\n\n-10V\n-20V Vbg\n-30V\n-40V\n-50V\n\n3L\n\n6\n\n-50V\n\n50\n\n-4\n\n(c)\n\n- 40V\n\n4\n\nR sq(K\u03a9 )\n\nR sq(K\u03a9 )\n\n40\n\nR sq(K\u03a9 )\n\nRelative Green Shift\n\n0.24\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nVtg (V)\n\n2\n\n-4\n\n4\n\n(f )\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nVtg (V)\n\nFigure 1. Panel (a) shows a plot of Relative Green Shift (as defined in the main\ntext) for 90 few layer graphene areas, showing clear plateaus for graphene layer of\ndifferent thickness. Panel (b) shows the conductance of a device (indicated by the\nblue dot in the plot shown in panel (a)) measured in the presence of high magnetic\nfield (B=8T); plateaus are observed at conductance values characteristic for Dirac\nelectrons, indicating that flakes with Relative Green Shift = 0.06 are indeed single\nlayers. Panel (c) shows a schematic representation of double-gated graphene devices,\ntogether with the measurement configuration used to study transport as a function of\nvoltages applied to the top and back gates. Panels (d), (e) and (f) show plots of the\nsquare resistance in single (d), double (e) and triple (f) layers respectively, measured\nwhile sweeping the top gate, for different fixed voltages applied on the back gate (for\nsingle layer T = 300mK, W = 2\u03bcm, L = 1.4\u03bcm, \u03bc = 3500cm2 /V s, double layer\nT = 300mK, W = 1.7\u03bcm, L = 1\u03bcm, \u03bc = 900cm2/V s and for triple layer T = 1.5K,\nW = 1\u03bcm, L = 1.4\u03bcm, \u03bc = 800cm2 /V s).\n\nindicating that the fabrication of top gate structures does not damage significantly the\nmaterial (for trilayers the square resistance is somewhat lower, owing to the presence\nof an overlap between valence and conduction band). Increasing the external electric\nfield induces a well defined -and different- response for the square resistance of layers of\nmax\nis not affected by a finite Eex ; in\ndifferent thickness. Respectively, in a single layer Rsq\nmax\nbilayers at low temperature Rsq increases from 6K\u03a9 to very large values (> 100 K\u03a9);\nmax\nin trilayers Rsq\ndecreases with increasing Eex . These experimental findings, confirmed\nin a number of different samples (3 single layers, over 10 double and 10 triple layers)\nprovide a clear indication that each few layer graphene is a unique material system, with\ndistinct electronic properties.\nTransport measurements over a wide range of temperatures (from 300mK up to 150K)\nunderline the unique electronic properties of these few layer graphene devices. In bilayer\n\n\fDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n5\n\nmax\ngraphene the larger Eex , the more pronounced is the temperature dependence of Rsq\n,\nmax\nsee Fig. 2a and b. At Eex = 0 V/m, Rsq is only weakly temperature dependent (as it\nis typical of zero-gap semiconductors), and at Eex 6= 0 V/m the observed behavior is the\none typical of an insulating state. On the contrary, trilayer graphene devices display a\nmax\ndecrease of Rsq\nwhen lowering the temperature, stemming for the semimetallic nature\nof the constituent material.\nmax\nAt a more quantitative level we find that Rsq\nin bilayer graphene is well described\n1/3\nby \u221d exp(T0 /T ) , with T0 \u2248 20 K at the maximum applied external electric field (see\ninset in Fig. 2b). This temperature dependence is indicative of variable-range hopping\nin a two dimensional material where an energy gap has opened, and where disorder\ncauses the presence of sub-gap states (T0 is related to this subgap density of states[8])\n-making it difficult to estimate \u2206 from transport experiments.\nIndeed, in a disorder free bilayer graphene, at Eex 6= 0 a gap (\u2206) opens in the band structure and the density of states in the gapped region is zero. In this ideal case, when the\nmax\nFermi level is in the middle of the gapped region the value of Rsq\nat a finite temperature\nmax\nis entirely determined by thermally activated charge carriers (Rsq\n\u221d exp(\u2206/2kB T )).\nmax\nTherefore, \u2206 can be accurately determined from a plot of ln(Rsq ) versus 1/T . On the\nother hand, in real devices the presence of disorder creates a finite density of states in\nthe the band gap of bilayer graphene. Now charge carriers can conduct via variablemax\nmax\nrange hopping at Rsq\n. In this case Rsq\nis a function of the density of states at the\nFermi level and not any more simply a function of \u2206.\nThe fact that a gap opens in the band structure of bilayer graphene at finite Eex is\nevident from the temperature dependence of Rsq as a function of charge density. In\nparticular, when the Fermi level lays deep into the conduction and/or valence band,\na temperature independent Rsq is expected. However, when the Fermi level is shifted\nacross the energy gap region Rsq should display an insulating temperature dependent\nbehavior. Experimentally this is achieved by measuring Rsq at a fixed value of either\nof the gates (e.g. Vbg ) and for different voltage applied on the other gate (e.g. Vtg ) (see\nFig 2a and b). The cross over from band transport to variable hopping range in the gap\noccurs at the edge of the valence and conduction band (see Fig. 2b).\nSimilar previous transport experiments in double gated bilayer [8] reported an energy\nscale of 1-10mV associated with the insulating state induced by Eex 6= 0. This energy\nscale seen in transport is much smaller than the energy gap recently probed in optical spectroscopy experiments (\u2206 \u223c 200mV at Eex = 2V /nm [22]). Possibly the finite\nsub-gap density of states induced by the disorder is at the origin of the small energy\nscale measured in transport experiments, however the specific mechanism responsible\nfor these experimental observations remains an open question.\nThe temperature dependence of the resistance in trilayer graphene is opposite to the one\nobserved in bilayers, and it reveals that this material system is a semimetal with a finite\noverlap (\u03b4\u03b5) between conduction and valence band. This band overlap can be estimated\nwithin a two band model [12, 20, 21], where the number of thermally excited carriers\nincreases with temperature according to n(T ) = (16\u03c0m\u2217 /h2 c)kB T ln(1 + e\u03b4\u03b5/2KB T ) (m\u2217\n\n\f6\n\nDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n2\u2206\nEF\n\n130\n\n0.3K\n4.4K\n4.6K\n5K\n15K\n42K\n70K\n151K\n\n1\n\n12\nln(Rsq )(Rsq(K\u03a9))\n\n10\n\nVbg= -50V\n\n120\n\n10\n\n110\n\nRsq (K\u03a9)\n\nRsq (K\u03a9)\n\n100\n\nEF\n\n2\u2206\n\n3V\n2.5V\n2V\n0V\n-2V\n-4V\n\n8\n6\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nT-1/3 (K-1/3)\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nVtg(V)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75 100 125 150\nT (K)\n\n1.4\n\n4\nVtg = -3.2V\n\n2\n6\nR sq(K\u03a9 )\n\nVtg = 0V\n\n1.3\n\n4\n\nEF\n4.2K\n10K\n20K\n50K\n100K\n150K\n200K\n\nEF Vtg = -3.2V\n\nn(T)/n(4.2K)\n\nR sq(K\u03a9 )\n\nVtg = 0V\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n2\n1.0\n\n(c) -40\n\n-20\n\n0\nVbg(V)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(d)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nT(K)\n\nFigure 2.

Measurements at finite Eex show\nthat \u03b4\u03b5 decreases when increasing external electric field (\u03b4\u03b5 goes from 32 meV to 52\nmeV in the measurements of Fig. 2d).\nThese experiments demonstrate that a perpendicular electric field applied on few layer\ngraphene is a valuable tool to change the band structure of these materials. Double\n\n\fDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n7\n\ngated structures lead to the discovery of the only known electric field tunable insulator,\ni.e. bilayer graphene, and of the only known electric field tunable semimetal, i.e. trilayer\ngraphene.\n\n4. Evaporated Silicon oxide as top gate dielectric\nThe opening of a sizeable band gap in bilayer graphene, and large changes in the band\noverlap of graphene trilayers require the application of large external electric fields to\nthese material systems. It is the breakdown field of the gate-dielectric that imposes\na limit to the maximum value of Eex experimentally accessible in double gated structures. To optimize this aspect of the devices, we conducted a systematic study of the\nbreakdown electric field of SiO2 gate oxide for devices with different areas, fabricated\nunder different conditions. Here we discuss the details of this investigation. From our\nstatistical analysis we conclude that what is crucial is not the SiO2 deposition method,\nbut the details in the metallization of top gate electrodes afterwards, which affect the\nfinal quality of the oxide gate dielectric.\nWe compare capacitor devices fabricated following two different procedures for one of\nthe oxide dielectric/metal electrode interfaces. In particular, the devices were fabricated\non a Si/SiO2 substrate (identical to the one used for the graphene devices previously\ndescribed) on which we deposit a Ti/Au (5/20 nm) film -common electrode for the capacitors. In devices of type A, the SiO2 deposition and top electrode (Ti/Au 5/20 nm)\nmetallization processes were carried without breaking the vacuum. On the contrary in\ndevices of type B, the SiO2 gate dielectric was exposed to air for one hour prior to the\ndeposition of the top electrode metals. The SiO2 deposition was carried out typically\nat 3 \u2217 10\u22127 torr back ground pressures. We did not observe a dependence of the insultating properties of the SiO2 dielectric, breakdown field and leakage current over the\nbackground pressure range from 1 \u2217 10\u22127 to 5 \u2217 10\u22127 torr.\nFig. 3a and b show various I \u2212 V traces, measured in ambient condition, for type A and\ntype B devices. A first clear difference between the two types of devices is the magnitude\nof the leakage current, visible by plotting the I \u2212V curves both in linear and logarithmic\nscale, see Fig. 3. For a surface area of 215 \u00d7195\u03bcm2, we find Ileakage \u2243 2.5 \u2217 10\u221210A/\u03bcm2\nfor the best type B devices which is one order of magnitude larger than that measured\nin the worst type A devices (the difference for typical devices are much larger than one\norder of magnitude). This extremely different level of leakage current already indicates\nthat the exposure of SiO2 to air previous to the deposition of top metals has a large\nnegative influence on the insulating performance of the oxide.\nThe I \u2212 V characteristics further show that for a fixed surface area (215 \u00d7 195\u03bcm2), the\nbreakdown voltage VBD for type A is typically in the range 8V < VBD < 9V whereas\ntype B devices breakdown anywhere in the range 0V < VBD < 6V . The differences\nin the failure of device types are best summarized in the histogram plots of VBD -see\nFig. 4a. For type B we find a large spread in the distribution of VBD , in contrast to\n\n\f8\n\nDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n-4\n\n-4\n\n1x10\n\n1x10\n\nI(A)\n\nI (A)\n\ntype B\n\n-5\n\n5x10\n\n0\n\n(a) 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nV (V)\n\n-5\n\ntype A\n\n5x10\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nV(V)\n\n-9\n\n10\n-10\n\n-10\n\n-11\n\n2.5x10\n\ntype B\n\n-12\n\n2.5x10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n2.5x10\n\n(c)\n\ntype A\n\n10\n\nI (A/\u03bc m2 )\n\nI (A/\u03bc m2 )\n\n2.5x10\n\n-14\n\n10\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nV (V)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n(d)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nV (V)\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFigure 3.

Furthermore, the comparison\nof VBD for type A devices with different surface areas shows that VBD increases slightly\nwith decreasing the device area, possibly indicating that the properties of SiO2 in type A\nclose to breakdown are determined by small defects present in the film with rather small\nprobability. However, we cannot rule out that the differences between the different sample populations originate from small differences (2-3 nm) in the thickness of the SiO2\nlayers. Note, in fact, that the leakage currents of these devices at low bias have only\nsmall sample-to-sample fluctuations, suggesting that the SiO2 layers in type A devices\nare very uniform.\nTo try to quantify better our observations and analyze the role played by the specific fabrication technique and surface areas on the device performance (e.g. breakdown\nfield), we adopt a failure analysis methodology [24]. In what follows we provide a statistical description of the breakdown probability introducing the cumulative probability\n(P) as the probability of a device to breakdown at a given voltage.

The panels in (b) and (c)\nshow the cumulative probability for type A devices for different surface areas (dots are\nexperimental data, and the continuous line is a fit to the Weibull distribution). The\nplot in d) is a fit to the cumulative probability for type B devices (S = 215 \u00d7 195\u03bcm2 )\nto the Weibull distribution.\n\nology, we notice that possibly the most flexible distribution for the failure of a population\nof samples, is the Weibull distribution [24, 25] P = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212(VBD /V0 )\u03b2 S/S0 ] (S capacitor surface area, S0 reference surface area, \u03b2 and V0 are the Weibull parameters). The\nparameter \u03b2, also known as Weibull shape parameter, determines the shape of the probability density function -i.e. higher \u03b2 indicates distributions with low dispersion of VBD .\nV0 is the Weibull scale parameter, whose only effect is to scale the VBD distribution (the\nlarger V0 , the more \"stretched\" the distribution). Depending on the value of the Weibull\nparameters, this distribution mimics the behavior of other statistical distributions such\nas the normal and the exponential. Given a sample population, the Weibull parameters\nprovide a quantitative measure of the failure probability. Both \u03b2 and V0 are strongly\naffected by the failure mechanism which can eventually be identified when comparing\nthe Weibull parameters for different sample populations. For instance, a value of \u03b2 that\ndoes not depend on the capacitor surface area -i.e., the variance does not change with\nthe surface area-, means that the microscopic mechanism of breakdown is common to\n\n\fDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n10\n\nall the samples, independent of the specific area [25].\nThe good agreement between a fit to the Weibull distribution of the cumulative probability for each different surface area and device types shows that the data of each\ndifferent device population is well described by the Weibull distribution. To evaluate\nwhether a single Weibull scaling law can explain breakdown results for all the different\nsurfaces, we notice that -for type A- we can fit all the cumulative probability distributions with the same value \u03b2 = 52, see Fig. 4b. This is made apparent by plotting\nln(\u2212ln(1 \u2212 P )) = ln(S/S0 ) \u2212 \u03b2ln(V0 ) + \u03b2ln(VBD ) as a function of ln(VBD ) for data\nsets corresponding to different surface areas. Fig. 4b and c show clearly that all the\ndata are lined up on parallel linear slopes (i.e., \u03b2 is the same in all these cases). This\nfinding implies that the breakdown mechanism is the same for all studied surface areas.\nNote that V0 varies slightly with surface area, and that, as mentioned above, we cannot\nexclude that the origin of these variations is a small difference in the thickness of the\nSiO2 layers for the different device populations (a difference of 2-3 nm would suffice to\nexplain this observation).\nWe notice that \u03b2 = 52 -estimated from the fit in Fig. 4b and c- is comparable to values\nfound for thermally grown thin SiO2 films, and it is compatible with failure of the devices due to surface roughness [23] probably being transferred to the dielectric film from\nthe Ti/Au substrate. This quantitative analysis make it possible to state that electronbeam evaporated SiO2 , directly coated by a metallic layer without exposure to air has\nan essentially identical quality to that of thermally grown oxide. A similar analysis of P\nfor type B devices, gives a \u03b2 = 3.3 -i.e. a much higher dispersion of breakdown field (see\nFig. 4d). This small value for \u03b2 in type B devices quantifies the much larger statistical\nspread of the oxide properties in these devices. Since the only difference between type A\nand B devices is the fabrication step of the SiO2 /Ti interface, we conclude that exposure\nof the SiO2 to air is indeed the cause for the poor insulating qualities. Indeed it is well\nknown that SiO2 is an hygroscopic material, that easily absorbs humidity in air. The\nhumidity absorbed can affect the composition of the entire layer providing paths for\nthe leakage current, and creating weak spots at which breakdown occurs already at low\nvoltage.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion we have briefly reviewed transport in double gated bilayer and trilayer\ngraphene devices. Motivated by the need for large electric fields, we have conducted a\nstatistical study of the breakdown field for over 100 top gated structures fabricated in\ndifferent conditions and with different surface areas. Adopting a failure analysis based\non the Weibull distribution, we show that the most reliable top gates are obtained when\ndepositing in SiO2 /Ti/Au without breaking the vacuum. Electron-beam SiO2 layers\nevaporated in these ways have insulating characteristics as good as those of thermally\ngrown SiO2 layers.\n\n\fDouble-gated graphene-based devices\n\n11\n\n5.1.
