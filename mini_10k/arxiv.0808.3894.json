Many different examples of interfaces growing in heterogeneous systems have been found\nin phase separation by nucleation and growth [1, 2], solidification [3, 4], and fluid invasion in porous media [5, 6],\namong others.\nPhase field models of increasing complexity have in\nrecent years been extensively used in studying interface roughening as well as microstructure formation\n[5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. A particularly interesting\nproblem of interface roughening is that associated with\na fluid invasion front moving into a disorder medium [5],\nwhich can be experimentally studied with the Hele-Shaw\ncell set-up [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In modeling such a fluid invasion experiment, two different ways to consider the mobility parameter in a Model B type of phase field model,\ncalled the one-sided and symmetric models, were used by\nHern\u00e1ndez-Machado et al. [19] and Dub\u00e9 et al. [20, 21],\nrespectively. The difference between these two cases is\nthat in the two-sided model the mobility is constant\nthroughout the system, while in the one-sided model it\nbecomes zero in the phase which is being invaded.\nIn this paper our aim is to carry out a detailed analysis about the influence of the strength of the disorder\nin the two types of models described above. Both cases\ncan be described by a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation\nor Model B with quenched disorder in the background\nmedium. The boundary conditions are used to couple\nthe system to a reservoir of the invading phase with a\nconstant mass flux. At the linear level of small front\nfluctuations, both phase field models can be analyzed\nthrough linearized interface equations, that is, the evolution of the interface can be described in terms of the\ninterface profile alone. Moreover, the bulk diffusion fields\n\nimplicit in this description cause the interface equation to\nbecome spatially non-local [19, 20, 21]. It is thus of interest to examine how the models are influenced by varying\ndisorder strength, which can be easily realized in the experiments, too. To this end, we first define a critical value\nof the disorder strength \u03c3c , above which the disorder becomes strong. We find that at weak disorder strengths\n(\u03c3 < \u03c3c ) both models have the same interface scaling\nbehavior given by super-rough anomalous scaling, which\nis also predicted by the linear theory. We observe clear\ndeviation from this scaling when the disorder strength\ncomes close to \u03c3c , where super-roughness disappears and\nweak intrinsic anomalous scaling arises. Furthermore, in\nthe limit of strong disorder (\u03c3 > \u03c3c ), the two models are\nno longer equivalent. The one-sided model can still be\napplied to describe diffusive liquid invasion in good agreement with experimental results of Ref. [16]. However, in\nthis limit the symmetric model exhibits nucleation of the\ninvading phase in front of the advancing interface.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section II\nwe introduce the two versions of the phase field model,\nconsider the linearized interface equation (LIE) valid in\nthe weak disorder limit, and give an estimate for the\nstrong disorder limit, thus introducing a scale for the disorder strength. Section III defines the concepts of scaling in interface roughening, including super-rough and\nintrinsic anomalous scaling. In Setion IV we present our\nnumerical results, and finally give our conclusions in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE PHASE FIELD MODEL\n\nThe phase field model we are using describes a system\nof two phases separated by an interface. We introduce\na locally conserved field \u03c6 to represent the two phases\nof the problem with the equilibrium values \u03c6e = \u00b11 in\n\n\f2\nsuch a way that the interface position is at \u03c6(x, h) = 0.\nThe dynamics of the field is then assumed to follow a\nconserved equation based on a time-dependent GinzburgLandau Hamiltonian (model B [7]):\n\u2202\u03c6/\u2202t = \u2212\u2207 * j,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the current is proportional to the gradient of the\nchemical potential j = \u2212M (\u03c6)\u2207\u03bc. Here, the chemical\npotential is \u03bc = \u03b4F /\u03b4\u03c6 Rand the free energy is taken to\nbe of the form F [\u03c6] = drr (V (\u03c6) + (\u01eb\u2207\u03c6)2 /2). A simple double-well potential is chosen with a linear random\nterm:\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6) = \u2212 \u03c62 + \u03c64 \u2212 \u03b7(rr )\u03c6\n2\n4\n\n(2)\n\nThe variable \u03b7(r) is taken to be stochastic and it plays\nthe role of spatially quenched disorder in the system.\nThe disorder is characterized by its average h\u03b7i, and its\nstandard deviation \u03c3, which characterizes the disorder\nstrength. The disorder also has a correlation length lcorr ,\nwhich in a numerical scheme is most conveniently set to\nthe lattice spacing. Note that by considering \u03b7 as local\naverage over area of size lcorr , the choice of the length\nlcorr also enters the disorder strength. That is, the standard deviation of \u03b7 is \u03c3 when observed at scale lcorr .\nThe surface tension of this model can be calculated with\nthe disorder-free \"kink\" solution \u03c60 , or Goldstone mode,\ngiven by the lowest energy solution of the boundary conditions \u03c6(\u2212\u221e) = \u22121 and \u03c6(+\u221e) =\n\u221a 1. The resulting\ndimensionless surface tension is \u03b3 = 2/3 \u2243 0.47 [9].\nThe equation for the dynamics of the phase field reads\n\u2202\u03c6\n= \u2207M (\u03c6)\u2207\u03bc\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2207M (\u03c6)\u2207 \u2212 \u03c6 + \u03c63 \u2212 \u01eb2 \u22072 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b7(r) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M (\u03c6) is a mobility parameter which may depend\non the phase field. In the sharp interface limit \u01eb \u2192 0,\nthe normal velocity of the interface can be obtained by\nintegrating equation (3) in a region around the interface,\nvn \u2243 jn |\u00b1 = M (\u03c6)\u2202n \u03bc|+ \u2212 M (\u03c6)\u2202n \u03bc|\u2212 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the subscripts + and \u2212 correspond to the two\nphases of the system. In our study, two different functional forms for the mobility M (\u03c6) will be considered.\nFirst, we assume a symmetric parameter M = M0 constant for the whole system independent of the field \u03c6.\nIn this case, the velocity of the interface is controlled\nby the difference between incoming and outgoing currents. Second, we will consider a one-sided parameter M = M0 \u03b8(\u03c6), \u03b8(\u03c6) being the Heaviside step function, which is zero in the phase where \u03c6 < 0. Note\nthat the normal velocity of the interface then reduces\nto vn \u2243 \u2212M0 \u2202n \u03bc|\u2212 , that is, it is only proportional to the\noutgoing current. As we will see in our numerical results,\nthe two models can give different results and describe different physical situations depending on the strength of\nthe disorder.\n\nHere we consider the so-called driven case, where the\nmean velocity of the interface is fixed to a constant value.\nThe relevant boundary condition is to impose a fixed gradient of the chemical potential at the bottom of the system, \u2207\u03bc = \u2212V \u0177. Combined with the initial condition\nof\n\u001a\n+1 y < Hinit ;\n\u03c6=\n(5)\n\u22121 y \u2265 Hinit ,\nthe boundary condition leads to phase \u03c6 = +1 invading\nphase \u03c6 = \u22121 and the interface moving with a constant\naverage velocity. In the general context of the phase field\nmodel we will refer to these phases as A and B, respectively. In terms of liquid front invasion into a Hele-Shaw\ncell, these phases would be liquid and air, respectively,\nwhereas in terms of phase separation they would be the\nphases rich in components A and B.\n\nA.\n\nThe linearized interface equation\n\nThe dynamics of a front in the phase field model described above can also be considered in terms of an\nintegro-differential equation for the interface, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem by one, obviously a desirable property. However, this description can\nonly be obtained as a perturbation expansion around a\nflat front with small fluctuations, and since the fluctuations are caused by the disorder, this also means weak\ndisorder. Because the front dynamics are only obtained\nto first order in small fluctuations we call it the linearized\ninterface equation (LIE). It is noteworthy that the longranged effects of mass conservation in the phase field results in the LIE being spatially non-local, even though it\nis linear. This means that the LIE takes the form of convolutions in position, which can be made local in Fourier\nspace.\nThe LIE can be obtained using the Green's function G\nto express the phase field equation, Eq. (3), in terms\nof an integro-differential equation [20], and then projecting it\nR to an interfacial description with the operator\nP [*] = du\u2202u \u03c60 (u)[*]. The LIE takes the form of dispersion relation for Fourier components of small front\nfluctuations \u0125(k, t) around the average interface height\nH0 (t), (i.e. H(x, t) = H0 (t) + h(x, t)):\n\u2202t \u0125(k, t) = \u2212(\u1e220 |k| + \u03b3|k|3 )\u0125(k, t) + |k|\u03b7\u0302(k, t),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is surface tension, \u1e220 = V is the (constant) average front propagation velocity, and the disorder term\nis the Fourier transform of the two-dimensional\n(2D) disR\norder along the front, or \u03b7\u0302(k, t) = dxe\u2212ikx \u03b7(x, H(x, t)).\nFrom the dispersion relation (6), one immediately obtains\nthe crossover length scale\nr\n\u03b3\n\u03be\u00d7 = 2\u03c0\n,\n(7)\n\u1e220\n\n\f3\nwhen the two dispersion terms are equally strong. Physically the dominant dispersion mechanism then changes\nfrom surface tension to mass transport. In addition, because the conservative character of the capillary disorder\nterm |k|\u03b7\u0302(k, t), it turns out that the crossover length \u03be\u00d7\nacts as an upper cutoff for the correlation length of fluctuations. This means that in the long wavelength region,\nwhere mass transport controls the dissipation of front\nfluctuations, the interface is asymptotically flat. This effect has been numerically shown in Refs. [5, 20, 21, 22],\nand also in a general context of kinetic roughening [23].\nB.\n\nDefinition of disorder strength\n\nIn order to study the influence of disorder strength in\nthe phase-field model of Eq. (3), we need to define a\nmeasure for the relative strength of the disorder. This\ncan be achieved by comparing the disorder contribution\nin the dimensionless bulk free energy of Eq (2) to the\nsurface energy. We do this by considering a domain of\nlinear size r, where the local disorder average h\u03b7ir is a\nstochastic variable with standard deviation \u03c3r \u221d r\u22121 \u03c3,\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation of a single disorder\nsite, which is of linear size lcorr . The underlying disorder\nthen has a correlation length lcorr . Considering a circular\ndomain of radius r, it is energetically favorable for this\ndomain to be of the opposite phase than its surroundings\nif\n2\u03c0r\u03b3 \u2264 \u03c0r2 \u2206\u03c6h\u03b7ir ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the miscibility gap in our model is \u2206\u03c6 = 2. The\nLHS is the energy cost of the interface, whereas the RHS\nis the energy gain due to disorder. We consider the local\ndisorder average h\u03b7ir on the fluctuation\u221asite to be as large\nas its standard deviation \u03c3r = \u03c3 lcorr / \u03c0r. Then Eq. (8)\ngives the condition\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u03c3\u2265\n\u03b3,\n(9)\nlcorr\nfor when the disorder can locally dominate the bulk energy and thus is defined to be strong. The order of magnitude estimate for strong disorder in our dimensionless\nunits (lcorr = 1, \u01eb = 1) is thus obtained as the variance\nbeing of the same order as the surface tension \u03c3 = \u03c3c \u2248 \u03b3.\nNote in particular that no r dependence remains in the\nestimate, and thus the relative disorder strength will be\nthe same at all length scales (larger than the interface\nwidth \u01eb and disorder site size lcorr ).\nIII.\n\nSCALING OF ROUGH INTERFACES\n\nThe statistical treatment of a 1D interface H(x, t) is\nusually done by studying the scaling properties of its\nfluctuations over the whole system of total size L [24].\nFor scale-invariant growth the lateral correlation length\n\nof the fluctuations is expected to grow in time following a power law lc \u223c t1/z until it reaches the system size L, defining a saturation time ts \u223c Lz . Alternatively, the global width of the interface W (L, t) =\nh[H(x, t) \u2212 H]2 i1/2 increases as W (L, t) \u223c t\u03b2 for t < ts\nand becomes constant W (L, t) \u223c L\u03c7 for t > ts . Here, h..i\ndenotes average over different noise realizations and the\noverbar is an spatial average in the x direction. The\nquantities \u03c7, \u03b2 and z are the roughness, growth and\ndynamical exponent, respectively, and they are related\nthrough the scaling relation \u03c7 = \u03b2z. In the standard\nFamily-Vicsek scaling framework [25], this set of scaling\nexponents fully describe the scaling properties of the interface fluctuations.\nHowever, experimental results and several growth\nmodels have appeared in the last decade showing that\nglobal and local scales are not always equivalent. This\nis called anomalous scaling [26, 27]. Therefore, one has\nto compute the interface width at different window sizes,\nw(l, t) = hh[H(x, t) \u2212 hHil ]2 il i1/2 , where h...il denotes\nan average over x in windows of size l < L. For scaleinvariant interfaces local fluctuations are expected to increase as\nw(l, t) = l\u03c7 g(l/t1/z ),\nwith the corresponding scaling function\n\u001a \u2212(\u03c7\u2212\u03c7 )\nloc\nu\nfor u << 1;\ng(u) \u223c\n\u2212\u03c7\nu\nfor u >> 1,\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c7loc is the local rough exponent and it characterizes the roughness at small scales. One of the implications\nof anomalous scaling is that the local width saturates\nwhen the correlation length reaches the system size, i.e.\nat the time ts and not at the local time tl \u223c lz as occurs\nin the Family-Vicsek scaling. There is an intermediate\nregime between\ntl and ts where the local width grows as\n\u2217\nw(l, t) \u223c t\u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2217 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c7loc /z.\nAnother useful technique to determine the whole set\nof scaling exponents is to study the power spectrum of\nthe interface S(k, t) = hh\u0303(k, t)h\u0303(\u2212k, t)i. In the presence\nof anomalous scaling it is expected to show the following\nscaling\nS(k, t) = k \u2212(2\u03c7+1) sA (kt1/z ),\nwhere the scaling function has the general form\n\u001a 2(\u03c7\u2212\u03c7 )\ns\nu\nfor u >> 1;\nsA (u) \u223c\n2\u03c7+1\nu\nfor u << 1,\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nand \u03c7s defines the spectral roughness exponent. Different\nscaling arises from this scaling function [26]. For \u03c7s < 1\nit is always valid that \u03c7loc = \u03c7s and the Family-Vicsek\nscaling is recovered whenever \u03c7loc = \u03c7. In contrast, the\nso-called intrinsic anomalous scaling is observed when\n\u03c7s 6= \u03c7. Note that for this kind of anomalous scaling\na temporal shift in the power spectrum is observed.

Results from the symmetric\nand one-sided model are given in the upper(a,b,c) and lower(d,e,f) panels, respectively. Disorder strength is varied from left to\nright as: weak disorder (\u03c3 = 0.2), intermediate disorder (\u03c3 = 0.5), and strong disorder (\u03c3 = 1). Fitted growth exponents for\nthe smallest and largest slopes are given in the figures, with solid lines representing the fits.\n\nform is unreliable and inaccurate, however, and thus we\nrefrain from giving a measure for \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7s in the one case\nwe observe scaling of this type. On the other hand, for\n\u03c7s > 1 \u03c7loc = 1 and the super-rough scaling appears\nwhen \u03c7 = \u03c7s .\nIt is worth to remember here that the crossover length\n\u03be\u00d7 , present in the imbibition phenomenon becomes a very\nimportant scale in the kinetic roughening process. More\nprecisely, extensive numerical studies [5, 20, 21, 22] have\nshown that fluctuations of the interface do not evolve\nin time beyond this crossover length. Therefore, the inz\nterface fluctuations reach the steady-state at ts \u2243 \u03be\u00d7\ninstead of saturating at Lz . Additionally, since the interface is asymptotically flat at scales larger than the\ncrossover length, the crossover shows up as a maximum\nat the corresponding wavevector in the saturated structure factor S(k, t \u2192 \u221e).\n\nspacing normalizes the standard deviation when dimensionless numbers in the numerical scheme are turned to\nphysical units.\nFor the driven boundary condition, the methods used\nto obtain the interface description, and ultimately the\nLIE, predict that the mean value of the disorder will be\nirrelevant, as it has no contribution for the interface propagation. This has been numerically verified by our simulations of the full phase field models using different values\nfor the disorder average. Here we only report results with\nh\u03b7i = 0.\nAs numerical method, we chose the simple explicit Euler scheme, where the disorder can be straightforwardly\nadded. In two dimensions the timestep requirement\nof this method is not too restrictive for systems large\nenough for present consideration.\n\nA.\nIV.\n\nWeak disorder\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nOur study will be focused on the influence of the disorder on the scaling behavior of the fluctuating interface for\nthe two cases of the mobility M in the phase field model,\nthat is, the one-sided model and the symmetric case. In\nour simulations we have used gaussian distributed disorder with zero mean h\u03b7i = 0, and different disorder\nstrengths (standard deviation of \u03b7) \u03c3. In the numerical scheme the disorder will have a correlation length\nas long as the lattice spacing, meaning that the lattice\n\nFor weak disorder, both models of the phase field (onesided and symmetric) are expected to be equivalent, since\nthe same LIE describes both cases in this limit. The weak\ndisorder regime corresponds to \u03c3 \u226a \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the\nsurface tension. In our dimensionless units (\u01eb = 1 in Eq.\n(3)) \u03b3 \u2243 0.47. Numerically the roughness and growth exponents of \u03c7s \u2243 1.3 and \u03b2 \u2243 0.4, within the super-rough\nscaling description (\u03c7loc = 1, \u03c7 = \u03c7s ), were observed\nby integrating the LIE [22]. This is in agreement with\nour results for both phase field models at weak disorder,\n\n\f5\nwhich are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 on the left. From\nFig. 2(a) and (d) we observe \u03c7 = \u03c7s , since no temporal\nshift in the structure factor is present (unlike Fig. 2(c)).\nMoreover, in Fig. 3 we observe that at small disorder\nstrengths \u03c3 < 0.2 in accordance with \u03c3 \u226a \u03b3, the spectral\nroughness exponent saturates to the LIE value, and is\nindependent of the disorder strength.\nWe also find that numerical artifacts in the interpretation of the interface from the phase field model appear\nwhen the disorder is so small that the global interface\nwidth W (L, t) is much less than the numerical lattice\nconstant. This is due to the interpolation required to\nobtain the location of the interface between two sites\nof the numerical grid, and shows up as prominent periodic oscillation in interface width with oscillation time\n\u2206x/\u1e220 . While this numerical artefact can be removed\nby decreasing \u2206x, it means that in the convenient and\ntypically used [5, 19, 21, 22] dimensionless units, which\nlead to Eq. (3) with \u01eb = 1, only a very limited disorder\nstrength range leads to the universal weak disorder limit.\nThis range is roughly 0.1 < \u03c3 < 0.2, when \u2206x = 1.\n\nB.\n\nthree differences to the weak disorder case. First, the local growth exponent \u03b2 \u2217 approaches the global exponent\n\u03b2 (see Fig. 1(c)). Second, the spectral roughness exponent decreases drastically to the range of \u03c7s \u2243 0.5 (see\nFig. 3) and third, a temporal shift appears in the power\nspectrum (see Fig. 2(c)). We can thus conclude that the\nscaling picture of interface fluctuations changes from superrough to intrinsic anomalous scaling, where \u03c7s 6= \u03c7.\nThe picture becomes problematic for strong disorder,\nhowever, because the interface becomes less and less representable by a single valued function H(x, t). This is due\nto the interfacial area becoming more and more tattered\nby overhangs, droplets and bubbles. This also means that\nsome numerical tricks are needed to distinguish the interface from these bubbles and droplets. This distinction is\nessentially made by finding a path for the phase boundary across the system that locally has as small height\njumps as possible. This works relatively well as long as\nthe disorder is not much stronger than \u03c3 = 1 in our dimensionless units. However, note anomalous fluctuations\nin Fig. 1(c) around value 2.6 on the vertical axis, that are\ndue to the abovementioned reason.\n\nStrong disorder\n2.\n\nIn the regime of strong disorder, \u03c3 > 0.5, different\nscenarios occur depending on which model is used. Below, we discuss the cases of the symmetric and two-sided\nmodels separately.\n\n1.\n\nSymmetric model\n\nAccording to the analysis of the disorder strength\nabove, in this limit it is favorable for the phase field model\nto spontaneously create disperse domains of one phase\n(A) within the region that is initially of the other phase\n(B). Droplets of phase A will form in phase B, and this\nmixture will initially cover most of the system. However,\nlocal mass conservation must still be valid regardless of\nany nucleation events. This means that mass must be\ndiffusively transported from the A phase to the location\nwhere it nucleates within the B phase to facilitate a growing droplet.\nThis is exactly what happens in the symmetric model\n(see Fig. 4), when one imposes the initial condition of Eq.\n(5). Since there is no characteristic scale for the domain\ncreation, the droplets are not restricted by the crossover\nlength \u03be\u00d7 , which acts as a cutoff for the interface fluctuations and therefore, the surface roughening at large scales\nis different respect to a weaker disorder strength. This is\nobserved in Fig. 2(c), where the interface power spectrum\nis plotted for a higher disorder strength at different times\nusing the symmetric model. We can see that the fluctuations are not saturated, indicating that the crossover\nlength \u03be\u00d7 (represented by the dashed line) is not acting\nanymore as an upper cutoff. In addition, our numerical\nresults for the symmetric model at strong disorder show\n\nOne-sided model\n\nUsing the one-sided model allows us to suppress the\ndomain creation in phase B, where the mobility parameter is zero. Then, the position of the interface H(x, t)\ncan be found by taking the largest height where the phase\nA has advanced to at time t, coming from the phase B\nwhen the phase field is above zero. In Fig. 4 we show an\nexample of the interface profile at different times for a\nstrong disorder, \u03c3 = 1.0.\nThe growth exponent \u03b2 \u2243 0.5 measured for strong disorder strength (see Fig. 1(e) and (f)) agrees with the\nexperimental value of \u03b2 = 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 reported in Ref.\n[16] for liquid front dynamics into a Hele-Shaw cell. Likewise, a similar variation in the spectral roughness exponent \u03c7s , which changes from \u03c7s \u2243 1.23 to \u03c7s \u2243 0.91 when\nthe disorder strength is increased (see Fig. 3), was also\nexperimentally observed in the same reference, whith a\nvariation from \u03c7s = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 to \u03c7s = 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 when\nthe capillary forces of the Hele-Shaw cell were increased\n(see Fig. 15 in Ref. [16]). On the other hand, we numerically observe that the crossover length \u03be\u00d7 still acts as a\ncutoff length for the interface fluctuations at strong disorder (see Fig. 2). These results indicate that the model\ncan still describe the imbibition phenomenon at strong\ndisorder.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we have studied two different ways of\nconsidering the influence of the mobility parameter in\na Model B type of phase field model with a GinzburgLandau type free energy.

We have focused on\nthe case of driven front invasion, where there is a forced\nconstant mass flux into the system that follows locally\nconserved dynamics. The symmetric model, studied for\nexample in Refs. [5, 21, 22], uses a constant mobility factor, whereas the one-sided model, studied for example in\nRefs. [19, 28], uses a mobility that is zero in the receding\n\nphase, which we call phase B.\nWe note that both models have previously been turned\ninto non-local linear interface equations (LIEs) in the\nlimit of small front fluctuations, which is equivalent to\nweak disorder [19, 21, 22]. These LIEs are identical for\nboth models, and therefore both models are expected to\nhave identical scaling behavior at the weak disorder limit.\nThis is verified by direct comparison of numerical simulations. Furthermore, these results also agree with the\nrelevant Hele-Shaw experiments [16].\nWe give an estimate for the strong disorder limit by\ncomparing the disorder contribution to bulk energy to\nthe surface tension. We find that the linear weak disorder limit is found well below this disorder value, and that\nonly in this limit does the roughness exponent not continuously depend on the disorder strength in either model.\nThis means that a well-defined region of universality only\nexists at the weak disorder limit.\nNumerically we study the dependence of the growth\nand roughness exponents of the invasion fronts as a function of the disorder strength. Our results are consistent\nwith a (continuous) change of scaling behavior from superrough to intrinsic anomalous scaling, when the disorder strength is increased from weak to strong.\nAt strong disorder, the symmetric model is no longer\nfound to correspond to the Hele-Shaw experiment due\nto domain creation of the invading phase in front of the\n\n\f7\npropagating interface. As our analysis shows, the domain growth can occur at all length scales (larger than\nthe disorder site size lcorr of the system) without any\ncharacteristic radius, which is a phenomenon observed in\nother experimental situations such as nucleation on dislocations [29] or binary mixtures [2]. In contrast, the results for the one-sided model do agree well with the HeleShaw experiments [16], even as the disorder strength is\nincreased.\n\nH(x,t)\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n50\n\nx\n\n100\n\n150\n\nWe hypothesize that the change in scaling behavior\nis due to decreased effect of surface tension and mass\ntransport in interface roughening as the disorder becomes\nstrong. Since the argument of strong disorder is the dominance of disorder over surface tension, the scaling in the\nregime dominated by the surface tension (characterized\nby having a correlation length lc < \u03be\u00d7 ) should change for\nboth models at strong disorder. In the one-sided model,\nmass transport still restricts interface roughening, and\nthus the crossover scale \u03be\u00d7 persists. Conversely in the\nsymmetric model the nucleated domains create roughening by avalanches that are not controlled by mass transport from the reservoir, and thus the crossover scale \u03be\u00d7\nbecomes irrelevant.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFIG. 4: An example of a set of rough fronts for strong disorder \u03c3 = 1 using both models: one-sided model (top) and\nsymmetric model (middle).
