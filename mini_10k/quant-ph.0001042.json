Duality plays a\ntral role in many supersymmetri\n\nen-\n\ntheories su h as Yang-Mills theories\n\nor strings models. We investigate the possible existen e of some duality\nwithin supersymmetri\n\nquantum me hani s.\n\nPM/99-43. To be published in Modern Physi s Letters A\n\n1\n\n\fIntrodu tion\nSupersymmetry is an ex iting idea to relate bosons and fermions. Many\nparti le physi ists think that supersymmetry\n\nould be found in Nature, not\n\ntoo far from the ele troweak s ale, typi ally the TeV s ale. From a theoreti al\npoint of view, supersymmetry naturally explains, for example, the large ratio between the ele troweak s ale and the other higher physi al s ales as the\nPlan k or the GUT s ales. Moreover, supersymmetry favours the uni\u001c ation\nfor the three fundamental\n\noupling\n\nonstants responsible for the ele tromag-\n\nneti , the weak and the strong intera tions. With the present data, su h an\nuni\u001c ation is not possible within the Standard Model but be omes probable in its supersymmetri\n\nversion like the MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetri\n\nStandard Model). Supersymmetry\n\nan also enri h quantum me hani s and\n\ngives the so\n\nquantum me hani s (SQM) whi h is a\n\nalled supersymmetri\n\nni e framework to test new\n\non epts in Physi s. SQM is famous due to the\n\npioneering papers of Witten on supersymmetry breaking[1\u2104. SQM also gives\nnew understandings of the analyti al solvability of\n\nertain potentials and of\n\nthe (super)BKW approximation whi h turns out to be exa t for a large\nof potentials, or allows\n\nlass\n\nonne tions between isospe tral hamiltonians and the\n\nmulti-soliton solution of the Korteweg-De Vries non linear equation. Mu h\nmore about SQM\n\nan be found in [2,3\u2104 and referen es therein.\non ept whose original aim was to\n\nonne t\n\ntwo di\u001berent regimes of the same dynami s. The ele tri -magneti\n\nDuality is a very fas inating\n\nduality\n\nis the most popular example where a weakly\nis ex hanged for a strongly\n\noupled version of a theory\n\noupled formulation.\n\nThe\n\non ept of duality\n\nhas been extended and means an equivalen e between two formulations of a\nmodel or between two di\u001berent models. Su h a\n\nase is the duality between\n\nthe sine - Gordon model and the massive Thirring model [4\u2104,\ntwo-dimensional solitoni\n\nobje t and a two-dimensional fermioni\n\nmeans that there is no guarantee at all that the\n\nonne ting a\n\u001celd. That\n\nonne tion is simple.\n\nSupersymmetry goes well with duality. As a matter of fa t, some problems in duality invariant gauge theories disappear when supersymmetry omes\nin. This is exa tely what happens in [N=4\u2104 Supersymmetri\nory [5\u2104.\n\nYang-Mills the-\n\nSupersymmetry is also an essential ingredient to study duality in\n\nstring theories [6\u2104. In this paper we will elaborate on the following simple\nidea: is it possible to \u001cnd a strong/weak\n\noupling duality in the framework\n\nof supersymmetri\n\nHowever\n\nquantum me hani s ?\n\nlear the question may\n\nbe, the de\u001cnition remains vague. Thus we will dis uss a bit more this point\n2\n\n\flater, in the \u001crst se tion of this paper. In the se ond se tion we will develop\nduality in SQM with a pre ise de\u001cnition. After the\n\non lusion, we will work\n\nout in an appendix two examples to illustrate se tion II.\n\nSe tion I\nThe idea we wish to explore is the mixing of duality and supersymmetri\nquantum me hani s. What does this mean? To be more pre ise, we will try\nto \u001cnd duality in SQM and not to link by duality SQM to some other theory,\nand more exa tly to stay in a model of SQM, and not to map a model of\nSQM with a strong\n\noupling in another model of SQM with a weak\n\nAny model of SQM\ntheory.\n\noupling.\n\nan be written in a superspa e formalism like a \u001celd\n\nHere we will use the hamiltonian formulation where the physi s\n\nof the model lies in an hamiltonian H whi h is a non negative operator.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nOne has H = {Q, Q } where Q and Q , the \u0010super harges\u0011, an be seen as\noperators transforming \"bosons\" into \"fermions\" and vi e versa.

The question is to know whether one of them\n\noupled and the other one weakly\n\nLet us denote by\npositive\n\nW\n\noupled.\n\nthe (one dimensional) spa e variable and by g a real\n\nonstant. One has :\n\nV\u2212 (x, g) = W 2 (x, g) \u2212 W \u2032 (x, g)\nand\n\nV+ (x, g) = W 2 (x, g) + W \u2032(x, g),\nW \u2032 = dW/dx.\nNaively, if V\u2212 is zero,\n\nwhere\n\nV+\n\nthe\n\noupling\n\nould be said \"weak\" ; then\n\nbe di\u001berent from zero and the\n\noupling\n\nould be said \"strong\". The solution\n\nW = \u22121/(a + x), where\n2/(a + x)2 . As a onsequen\nis\n\na is an arbitrary\n\nonstant, and\n\nV+\n\nwill\n\nis obviously\n\ne of this rough example, it seems possible to see\n3\n\n\fa path through the solution but perhaps not really interesting. Indeed, in\nthis example, there are some drawba ks :\n-\n\ng\n\ndoes not appear at all ;\n\n- the potential\n\nV+\n\n- the Hamiltonian\n\nis a singular potential on the line ;\n\nH\u2212\n\nis just a se ond derivative, without any dynami al\n\nontent.\nOne\n\nan be a bit less naive in modifying our guess : is it possible to \u001cnd a\n\nouple of supersymmetri\n\npotentials su h as :\n\nV\u2212 (x, g) = g f (x, g)\n\nand\n\nV+ (x, g) = f (x, g)/g ?\n\nIn su h a way it seems that one for es, if\nand a strong\n\noupling for\n\nV+ .\n\ng \u223c 0,\n\na weak\n\n(I.1)\n\noupling for\n\nIn solving the system (I.1), one su\n\nV\u2212\n\nessively\n\ngets the superpotential :\n\nW (x, g) =\n\n\u22121\n,\ns(a + x)\n\nand the potentials:\n\nV\u2212 (x, g) =\n\n(1 \u2212 s)\n,\n+ x)2\n\ns2 (a\n\nand\n\nV+ (x, g) =\nwhere\n\ns = (1 \u2212 g 2 ) / (1 + g 2)\n\n(1 + s)\n,\n+ x)2\n\ns2 (a\n\nand a is an arbitrary\n\nonstant.\n\nAlthough the potentials are still singular on a line, this result is quite\ninteresting. Indeed, one obtains the following identity :\n\nV\u2212 (x, 1/g) = V+ (x, g)\nsin e s is\n\nhanged in\n\n\u2212s\n\nwhen one\n\nhanges\n\ng\n\nin\n\n1/g .\n\nThis is a rather good\n\nfeature. Now both potentials depend only on s and not on\nrather bad feature, be ause when g runs from zero to in\u001cnity,\n\n\u22121\n\nand\n\n+1\n\nand the strength of the\n\nThis is a general\n\nouplings is somewhat washed o\u001b.\n\nonsequen e of our proposal to sear h for duality within\n\nthe same SQM model. A tually, assuming there is only one\n\ng(6= 1)\n\ng , and this is a\ns goes between\n\nin the model, the duality we look for\n4\n\noupling onstant\n\nan be written as follows :\n\n\fH\u2212 (x, 1/g) = H+ (x, g)\n\n(I.2)\n\nThat means that a SQM model determined by the two hamiltonians\n\n(H\u2212 (x, 1/g), H+ (x, 1/g)), onne ted by susy thanks to the superpotential\nW (x, 1/g) in a regime of strong oupling (if g \u223c 0), is ex hanged in the SQM\nmodel determined by (H+ (x, g), H\u2212 (x, g)), whi h works in a weak oupling\nregime. The formula I.2 is just equivalent to V\u2212 (x, 1/g) = V+ (x, g), or :\nW 2 (x, 1/g) \u2212 W \u2032 (x, 1/g) = W 2 (x, g) + W \u2032 (x, g).\nOne\n\nan re-write this formula as :\n\nW 2 (x, 1/g) \u2212 W 2 (x, g) = W \u2032 (x, 1/g) + W \u2032 (x, g) .\nWhen one hanges\n\n(I.3)\n\ng in 1/g in this formula, the left hand side gets the opposite\n\nvalue while the right hand side is invariant. Hen e both sides vanish and the\nunique superpotential solution of I.2 is su h that:\n\nW (x, 1/g) = \u2212W (x, g) .\nSo any fun tion of\n\nx\n\nand\n\ng\n\n(I.4)\n\nverifying I.4 is an answer to our question. If one\n\nlooks for su h fun tions, the simplest form is\n\nW (x, g) = a(x)b(g),\n\nwith the\n\nondition\n\nb(1/g) = \u2212b(g) .\nThe general solution of I.5 is\nfun tion, but one\n\n(I.5)\n\nb(g) = B(Log(g))\n\nwhere\n\nB\n\nis any odd\n\nan \u001cnd rather simple solutions without logarithm. For ex-\n\nb(g) = g \u2212 1/g is a solution but not suitable for a perturbative point a\nview (as Log(g)) sin e it has no expansion neither in g = 0 nor in g = in\u001cnity.\nBetter solutions are b(g) = (1 \u2212 g)/(1 + g), whi h is tanh(\u2212(Log(g))/2), or\nb(g) = arctan(g) \u2212 \u03c0/4.\nample,\n\nAnyway, the result (I.5) indu es two remarks :\n\nb(g) and not g .\n- if the true oupling onstant b(g) belongs to\nb(1/g) belongs to the intervalle [\u2212d, \u2212c].\n- the true\n\nThe\n\noupling\n\nonstant is\n\nthe intervalle\n\n[c, d],\n\nthen\n\nonsequen e is evident: it is impossible to talk about strong/weak\n\nduality in su h a simple\n\nase.\n\nOf\n\nourse,\n\nW (x, g) = a(x) b(g)\n\nbeing the most general solution of (I.4) but one\n\n5\n\nis far from\n\nannot \u001cnd other solutions\n\n\fwhi h es ape the previous\nbetween\n\nW (x, g)\n\nand\n\nonsequen e, be ause for a \u001cxed\n\nW (x, 1/g)\n\nx\n\nthe relation I.4\n\nfalls in a formula similar to I.5. Thus it is\n\nimpossible to \u001cnd a strong/weak duality in a same model of SQM, but one\nan sear h for a\nthe\n\nouple\n\nlass of models where the\n\n(H+ , H\u2212 ),\n\nvalue. In these\n\nouple\n\n(H\u2212 , H+ )\n\ndepending on the sign of the (true)\n\nases, the duality would mean a\n\nis\n\nhanged in\n\noupling\n\nonstant\n\norresponden e between two\n\ndi\u001berent regimes of the same SQM model.\n\nSe tion II\nIn order to naturally introdu e the\n\nlass of models that we look for, we will\n\nontinue to follow for a while the ingenuous path presented in the previous\nse tion.\n\nFurther, we note that, for any quantum me hani al hamiltonian,\n\nthere are several supersymmetri\nharmoni\n\nos illator hamiltonian\n\nextensions. For example, starting from the\n\nH0\n\n( in\n\nonvenient units :\n\n2m = ~ = 1\n\n) :\n\nH0 = \u2212d2 /dx2 + \u03c9 2x2 ,\none has\n\nH\u2212 = \u2212d2 /dx2 + \u03c9 2 x2 \u2212 \u03c9,\nand\n\nH+ = \u2212d2 /dx2 + \u03c9 2 x2 + \u03c9,\nwhen the superpotential is\n\nW = \u03c9x . But it is possible to obtain other superH\u2212 and H+ (see for instan e the se ond example\n\npotentials and hamiltonians\n\nof the Appendix ). So we will assume that we know a \"free\" hamiltonian\nH0 = \u2212d2 /dx2 + k(x), where k(x) is a fon tion of x and of some other parameters, and we add extra terms to simulate the weak and strong\n\nouplings\n\nas we did in I.1. We write :\n\nH\u2212 (x, g) = \u2212d2 /dx2 + k(x) + g f (x, g)\nand\n\nH+ (x, g) = \u2212d2 /dx2 + k(x) + f (x, g)/g .\nIn a\n\nk(x)\n\nH0 as a free hamiltonian, we suppose also that\ng (g 6= 1). One ould probably imagine other forms\n\nordan e with the idea of\nis independent of\n\n(II.1)\n\n6\n\n\fthat II.1 but the main virtue of our type is its solvability, without altering\nthe physi al meaning. One\nsome sign or by multiplying\nwill not\n\nould also slightly modify the proposal II.1 by\n\nf\n\nby\n\ng\n\n; these\n\nhanges are really minor, thus we\n\nonsider them any longer .\n\nIn solving II.1 in terms of the superpotential, one obtains the following\nRi\n\nati equation :\n\n\u0001\nW \u2032 (x, g) = s W 2 (x, g) \u2212 k(x) ,\n\nwhere again we get the parameter\n\ns = (1 \u2212 g 2 ) / (1 + g 2 ).\n\n(II.2)\nWe use the usual\n\ntri k to linearize the Ri ati equation II.2 ; introdu ing a fun tion y of x su h\n\u2032\nas W = \u2212y /(s y), one readily gets the following Sturm - Liouville equation :\n\ny \u2032\u2032 \u2212 s2 k(x)y = 0 .\nOn e a solution\n\ny\n\n(II.3)\n\nis found for this equation II.3, we have the potentials\n\nsolution of the problem (II.1) :\n\nV\u2212 (x, g) = +sk(x) + (1 \u2212 s)(y \u2032/(sy))2,\nand\n\nV+ (x, g) = \u2212sk(x) + (1 + s)(y \u2032/(sy))2.\nThe supersymmetry is not broken if one\n\nan\n\nhoose the sign of\n\n(II.4)\n\ns\n\nsu h\n\nthat only one of the following sets of equations is true :\n\nH\u2212 (x, g) y (+1/s) = 0\n\nand\n\nH+ (x, g) y (+1/s) 6= 0,\n\nH+ (x, g) y (\u22121/s) = 0\n\nand\n\nH\u2212 (x, g) y (\u22121/s) 6= 0.\n\nor\n\n(1/s)\nFurthermore to get dis rete spe tra for H\u2212 and H+ , one needs that y\n(\u22121/s)\n2\nor y\nbe normalizable (L (x, R)), depending on the signe of s. Then the\norresponding hamiltonians\n\nH\u2212\n\nand\n\nH+\n\nwill be isospe tral (up to the lowest\n\nbound state).\nLet us be more pre ise about the solution II.4.\nthat when we perform the following\n\nV\u2212 (x, g) \u2192 V\u2212 (x, 1/g),\n\nhange :\n\ng \u2192 1/g , then s \u2192 \u2212s and\nV+ (x, g). A tually, this is\n\nwhi h would be equal to\n\n7\n\nAt \u001crst sight, it seems\n\n\fnot true be ause it is ne essary to take into a\n\nount the eventuality that\n\nonditions of the equation II.3 depend on g . In su h a way, y\ng dependent and V\u2212 (x, 1/g) di\u001berent from V+ (x, g). So, in general,\nV\u2212 (x, 1/g) 6= V+ (x, g) and it is not suitable for duality ; fortunately there are\n\nthe boundary\nwould be\n\nsimple situations where we get it.\nAssuming that\n\nk(x) is an even fun\n\ntion of\n\nx, then the se\n\nond order di\u001ber-\n\nential equation II.3 (without \u001crst order term) has two independent solutions\nof given parity, one is even and the other is odd in the variable x, and both\n2\ndepend on s . The odd one is zero at x = 0, so leading possibly to singular\npotentials. Thus it is highly preferable to use the even solution, and then\n\u2032\nthe ratio y /y will be well de\u001cned and insensitive to a possible g dependen e\noming from the boundary\n\nonditions. This is a\n\nase where we get the wished\n\nduality :\n- \u001crst regime :\n\n0 < s < 1 (0 < g < 1)\n\nH\u2212 (x, s) = \u2212\n\nd2\n+ V\u2212 (x, s)\ndx2\n\nV\u2212 (x, s) = +sk(x) + (1 \u2212 s)(y \u2032 /(sy))2,\n\nH+ (x, s) = \u2212\n\nd2\n+ V+ (x, s)\ndx2\n\nV+ (x, s) = \u2212sk(x) + (1 + s)(y \u2032 /(sy))2,\nH+ (x, s) y (+1/s) 6= 0 and y (+1/s)\nIn this regime, the ground state energy of H\u2212 is zero and\neigenvalues of both H\u2212 and H+ are paired.\n\nand (for example)\nis normalizable.\nthe other energy\n\nH\u2212 (x, s) y (+1/s) = 0\n\nwith\n\n- se ond regime :\n\n\u22121 < s < 0 (1 < g < \u221e)\n8\n\n\fH\u2212 (x, s) = \u2212\n\nd2\n+ V\u2212 (x, s) = H+ (x, \u2212s)\ndx2\n\nV\u2212 (x, s) = V+ (x, \u2212s)\n\nH+ (x, s) = \u2212\n\nd2\n+ V+ (x, s) = H\u2212 (x, \u2212s)\ndx2\n\nV+ (x, s) = V\u2212 (x, \u2212s),\nH\u2212 (x, s) y (\u22121/s) =\n6 0 and y (\u22121/s)\nis normalizable. In this regime, the ground state energy of H+ is zero, and\nthe other energy eigenvalues of both H\u2212 and H+ are paired.\nIn other words, this duality ex hanges the role of H+ and H\u2212 , when one\nand (for example)\n\nH+ (x, s) y (\u22121/s) = 0\n\nwith\n\ngoes from the positive s regime to the negative s regime.\ning, one\n\nRoughly speak-\n\nould say that this duality ex hanges the \"boson\" spe trum and\n\nthe \"fermion\" spe trum (see \u001cgure 1).\nillustrative examples, one based on\nthe harmoni\n\nIn the appendix, we work out two\n\nk(x) =\n\nonstant and the other one on\n\nos illator.
