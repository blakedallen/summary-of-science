Zobay\nand B. M. Garraway [1]. It relies on adiabatic potentials for atoms dressed by a rf field in an\ninhomogeneous magnetic field. This trap is well suited to confine atoms tightly along one direction\nto produce a two-dimensional atomic gas. We transferred ultracold atoms into this trap, starting\neither from thermal samples or Bose\u2013Einstein condensates. In the latter case, technical noise during\nthe loading stage caused heating and prevented us from observing 2D BECs.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Vk, 03.75.-b, 32.80.Pj\n\nIt is well known that Bose\u2013Einstein condensation\n(BEC) of homogeneous gases cannot occur in dimensions less than 3 [2]. However 2D condensation is possible inside a power law external confining potential [3].\nCrossover from 3D condensation to 2D and 1D has been\nexperimentally demonstrated by measuring the aspect\nratios of atomic clouds released from anisotropic traps\n[4]. Quantum gases in low dimensions and particularly\nin 2D are of much interest for several reasons. It is predicted that the coherence and the mean-field interaction\nare strongly influenced by the trap parameters in the\ntightening direction [5]. These properties are of crucial\nimportance for integrated atom optics [6, 7]. In 2D, the\nappearance of 1/2-anyons quasiparticles has been predicted in a rotating trap [8]. The first step towards the\ncreation of these quasiparticles is to generate BEC in the\nlowest Landau level. This has been recently realized in\na 3D rotating trap [9]. By the centrifugal force the BEC\napproaches the two-dimensional regime.\nThere should be a dramatic improvement of this kind\nof experiments if the trapped gas is two-dimensional at\nthe start. A 2D gas is obtained by strongly confining\natoms along one direction. There are several ways to\nproduce such a \"2D trap\". One is to use rapidly decaying fields supported by a surface, which provides very\nnaturally a strong transverse confinement. The decaying\nfield may be either optical, as for the double evanescent\nwave trap [10, 11], or magnetic like in the Zeeman effect\nsurface trap [12]. 2D BEC was recently achieved in a\ntrap combining the use of a single evanescent wave and\ngravity [13]. However, the use of surface traps may lead\nto perturbation of the atomic cloud due for instance to\nthe roughness of the trapping potential, as pointed out\nin [13]. This effect is similar to the condensate fragmentation observed in atom chips [14]. This is a disadvantage for experiments similar to [9]. The use of an optical\nstanding wave is a natural way to produce 2D traps far\nfrom any surface [15, 16]. The drawback of this method\nis that the atoms are filled in many pancake traps, unless the lattice period is chosen large enough. We present\nhere the experimental implementation of a single pancake\ntrap sitting in free space.\nA new quasi 2D trap was proposed by Zobay and Gar-\n\nraway [1, 17]. It relies on the adiabatic potentials seen\nby an atom sitting in an inhomogeneous magnetic field\nB0 (r) and dressed by a radio-frequency field. The same\npotentials are implied in rf-induced evaporative cooling;\nin that case, they are used to limit the depth of the trap.\nTo realize the trapping potential, we start from the\nmagnetic trap we use for producing a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. 87 Rb atoms in the 5S1/2 , F = 2 state sit in\nthis inhomogeneous magnetic field and experience a mF dependent magnetic potential mF (V0 + Vtrap (r)). This\nis a trapping potential for the state F = 2, mF = 2 we\nwork with. V0 corresponds to the offset magnetic field B0\nat the center of the magnetic trap r = (0, 0, 0). When a\nrf field B1 cos(\u03c9rf t) of Rabi frequency \u03a9 = g\u03bcB B1 /2h\u0304 -\nwere g = 1/2 and \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton - is applied\nto the atoms in the strong coupling regime, the atomic\nlevels present an avoided crossing at the points where the\nrf frequency \u03c9rf is resonant with the frequency difference\nbetween the mF states, that is when V0 +Vtrap (r) = h\u0304\u03c9rf .\nThe new potentials experienced by the dressed atoms\nread mF V (r), where:\nq\nV (r) = (Vtrap (r) \u2212 h\u0304\u2206)2 + (h\u0304\u03a9)2\n(1)\nIn this last equation, we introduced the rf detuning h\u0304\u2206 =\nh\u0304\u03c9rf \u2212 V0 with respect to the rf transition in the center of\nthe magnetic trap. In this semi-classical approach, the\neigenstates \u03c6mF (r) corresponding to these energies are\nstill spin states, along a direction tilted from the local\ndirection of the magnetic\nfield at point r by \u221a\nan angle \u03b8\n\u221a\nwhere cos \u03b8 = \u2212\u2206/ \u22062 + \u03a92 and sin \u03b8 = \u03a9/ \u22062 + \u03a92 .\nIn the lab frame, the tilted eigenstate is rotating with\npulsation \u03c9rf around the local direction of the magnetic\nfield. The state \u03c6mF is identical to the uncoupled magnetic substate \u2212mF at infinite positive detuning \u2206, and\nto mF when \u2206 is getting very large and negative. Note\nthat they are eigenstates only for the internal degrees of\nfreedom, r being fixed. A motional induced coupling may\nlead to Landau\u2013Zener transitions between these states\nwhen r changes, which may be avoided by using a large\nenough rf coupling \u03a9.\nFor atoms in the \u03c62 dressed state, this potential\npresents a minimum at the points where Vtrap (r) = h\u0304\u2206.\nThe locus of these points is the surface where the norm of\n\n\f2\n3\nE/h (MHz)\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n\n-200\n\n-100\n0\n100\nz (microns)\n\n200\n\nFIG. 1: Cut along the z axis of the total potential mgz +\nmF V (r) with mF = 2 (upper curve) and mF = \u22122 (lower\ncurve). The lower state potential (corresponding to state \u03c6\u22122 )\nis used during evaporative cooling, where the depth is limited\nby the rf coupling. For the upper state (\u03c62 ), the potential\nminimum sits at the bottom of a shell (at z = z0 ). Parameters are: \u2206/2\u03c0 = 1 MHz and \u03a9/2\u03c0 = 170 kHz. The initial\nmagnetic potential is the one of our QUIC trap (see text).\n\nthe magnetic field has a given value \u2013 or equivalently an\niso-B surface. If for instance the magnetic trapping potential is harmonic, the iso-B surfaces are ellipsoids. The\natoms are thus forced to move onto an 'egg shell', their\nmotion being very limited in the direction orthogonal to\nthe shell. This 'atomic bubble' is not easily observable\nhowever: The atoms fall at the bottom of the shell due\nto gravity. As the typical radius of the shell increases,\nthe atomic cloud becomes essentially two-dimensional.\nA cut of the potential including gravity is represented on\nfigure 1. It shows that along the vertical z axis, only one\nside of the shell will be occupied by the atomic cloud, as\nsoon as the temperature is lower than the energy difference between the top and the bottom of the shell.\nWe now will discuss the trap characteristics in the case\nof our experiment. The atomic cloud we start with is confined in a cigar shape QUIC magnetic trap [18]. The long\naxis of the cigar is horizontal and is denoted as x. This\nis also the direction of the offset magnetic field of 1.8 G,\ncorresponding to V0 /h = 1.3 MHz. y is the other horizontal axis along which the magnetic rf field is aligned [19].\nFinally, z is the vertical axis. The oscillation frequencies\nat the bottom of the QUIC trap are \u03c9x /2\u03c0 = 21 Hz and\n\u03c9y /2\u03c0 = \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 200 Hz. The QUIC trap is symmetric\nwith respect to the y = 0 plane. Initially, the atoms are\nconfined in the upper magnetic state F = 2, mF = 2. To\nload the atoms from this 3D trap into the bottom of a\nshell, we simply chirp a rf field from below the resonance\nat the center of the QUIC trap V0 /h\u0304 to the desired value\nof \u2206. The atoms thus always stay in the upper state we\nstart in, as soon as the Rabi frequency is large enough\nfor them to follow adiabatically the dressed state \u03c62 .\nThe cloud is located on an iso-B surface [20], centered\nat position x0 , y0 , z0 where y0 = 0 and z0 is the lowest\nheight which fulfills Vtrap (x0 , 0, z0 ) = h\u0304\u2206. As Vtrap depends only slightly on x near the cloud position, z0 is\n\nessentially given by Vtrap (0, 0, z0 ) = h\u0304\u2206. The oscillation\nfrequency in the strongly confined z direction may be\ninferred from the Rabi frequency \u03a9 and the vertical gradient \u03b1(z0 ) at position z0 of the trap potential, defined\nby: Vtrap (0, 0, z) \u2243 h\u0304\u2206 + (z \u2212 z0 ) \u03b1(z0 ). With these notations, the oscillation frequency in the tightly confining\ndirection z reads:\nr\n2\n\u03c9trans = |\u03b1(z0 )|\n(2)\nmh\u0304\u03a9\nIn a QUIC trap, the radial gradient \u03b1 is constant except in a small region around the minimum at z = 0.\nThe transverse oscillation frequency can still be monitored using the Rabi frequency \u03a9. However, the Rabi\nfrequency cannot be chosen arbitrarily small because of\nLandau\u2013Zener losses.\nThe horizontal frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 corresponding\nrespectively to the x and y directions directly depend on\nthe local shape of the iso-B surface. In the yz plane, due\nto the axial symmetry of the QUIC trap [21], the iso-B\nlines are circles and \u03c92 is merely the pendulum pulsation:\nr\ng\n(3)\n\u03c92 =\n|z0 |\nIn the xz plane, the iso-B lines are very elongated due\nto the cigar shape of the QUIC trap and they are more\ncomplicated [20]. \u03c91 is much smaller than \u03c92 and cannot\nbe expressed analytically. Its order of magnitude is given\nby approximating the iso-B lines by ellipses:\nr\ng \u03c9x\n\u03c91 \u2243\n(4)\n|z0 | \u03c9z\nAs |z0 | increases with \u2206, \u03c91 and \u03c92 may be controlled\nvia \u2206 and \u03c9trans via \u03a9; one can easily find a set of parameters such that \u03c9trans \u226b \u03c91 , \u03c92 .\nThe experimental setup has been described elsewhere [22]. In brief, if consists of a double MOT system, the atoms being continuously loaded from an upper\nvapor MOT into a lower MOT sitting in a low pressure\nglass cell. After a transfer in the magnetic QUIC trap,\nthe atoms are cooled down to the condensation threshold\nin 30 s by evaporative cooling (in the \u03c6\u22122 dressed state).\nWe then switch off the evaporation rf and switch on the\ntrapping rf at a frequency below the resonance frequency\nin the center of the trap (1.3 MHz). This ensures that the\natoms will be transferred in the \u03c62 state, which is connected with the bare mF = 2 state at very large negative\ndetuning. \u03c9rf is chirped from 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1 MHz to the desired\nvalue of the detuning \u2206 in typically 150 ms. The rf field\nis produced by a circular antenna of axis y, fed by a rf\nsynthesizer followed by either a 5 W or a 25 W amplifier.\nThe Rabi frequency \u03a9/2\u03c0 may be adjusted via a rf attenuator between 0 and 180 kHz and has been calibrated\nexperimentally. We checked that the initial negative detuning of 300 kHz was large enough to populate only the\n\u03c62 state when switching on the rf in a 2 ms linear ramp,\nat \u03a9/2\u03c0 = 180 kHz.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Successive absorption images of thermal clouds in the\nxz plane as the detuning \u2206 is increased.

The\natomic clouds contain typically 106 atoms at a temperature\nof 1 \u03bcK.\n\nThe series of absorption images shown on figure 2 illustrate the deformation of the atomic cloud as it is transferred into the egg shell trap. Starting from the QUIC\ntrap, the cloud is translated along z when \u2206 increases (as\nz0 depends on \u2206) and is deformed at the same time: It is\ncompressed in the z direction whereas it is relaxed along\nx. The curvature of the trap, due to the iso-B surface\ncurvature, is clearly visible. The vertical position of the\ncloud z0 is a linear function of \u2206 as soon as \u2206/2\u03c0 exceeds\n1 MHz, as one would expect for a constant magnetic field\ngradient. The measurements give access to the gradient\n\u03b1 which corresponds to 225 G/cm.\nIn order to better characterize the egg shell trap, the\noscillation frequency along z was measured at a given\nvalue of \u03a9/2\u03c0 = 180 kHz and \u2206/2\u03c0 = 2 MHz. The\nvertical oscillation frequency may be estimated to 550 Hz,\nknowing \u03b1 and \u03a9. To measure it, we excited the dipolar\nresonance at \u03c9trans by modulating with a 5 kHz depth the\ndetuning \u2206/2\u03c0 and thus the trap position z0 for 150 ms.\nThe vertical size of the cloud after a 10 ms time of flight\nwas measured and plotted as a function of the excitation\nfrequency. We found a peak centered at 600 Hz with\na HWHM width of 80 Hz, in good agreement with the\nexpected value. The small discrepancy is likely to be due\nto the approximate knowledge of the Rabi frequency \u03a9.\nThe vertical oscillation frequency (600 Hz) corresponds\nto a temperature of 30 nK. As the 3D transition temperature for 105 atoms in this trap is about 50 nK, pure thermal clouds confined in the adiabatic trap always remain\nthree-dimensional. However the situation is different for\na BEC where we shall compare the chemical potential \u03bc\nto the vertical oscillation frequency. The atom number,\nthe cloud position z0 and the oscillation frequency \u03c9trans\nwere measured in order to estimate \u03bc. \u03c91 and \u03c92 were\n\ngiven a value deduced from the measured z0 . For an extreme detuning \u2206/2\u03c0 = 8.7 MHz, we have z0 = \u2212560 \u03bcm\nand oscillation frequencies 600 Hz\u00d721 Hz\u00d72 Hz. For\n105 atoms, assuming Thomas\u2013Fermi theory in 3D, this\nyields a chemical potential \u03bc/h = 400 Hz which is smaller\nthan the vertical oscillation frequency. Therefore a condensate confined in this trap would present a 2D character.\nHowever, we did not obtain a 2D condensate in this\nanisotropic trap. When starting with a BEC, we observed a heating during the loading phase, which destroyed the BEC. We investigated the heating rate and\nlifetime of the egg shell trap using thermal gases initially prepared at 0.75 \u03bcK typically in the QUIC trap.\nThe atoms where transferred in the egg shell trap within\n150 ms. After a variable holding time at a constant rf\nfrequency (plateau) of 3 MHz in the anisotropic trap, a\ntime-of-flight image was taken 10 ms after releasing the\natoms from the trap. We measured the cloud size along\nx and z. The experiment was repeated using two different schemes for producing the rf field: (i) Either we\nproduced the rf ramp and the rf plateau with the same\nsynthesizer (Agilent 33250A) used in a voltage controlled\nfrequency mode (FM mode), (ii) or we used a first DDSsynthesizer (Direct Digital Synthesis, Stanford DS345)\nfor ramping the frequency and switched to another synthesizer (Rohde & Schwarz SML01) used at constant frequency (3 MHz) for the plateau. Note that the relative\nphase is not controlled at the switching.\nFor both schemes, we observed a strong heating along\nthe vertical direction during the loading rf ramp. The\nvertical temperature deduced from a time-of-flight measurement increased to about 4 \u03bcK, whereas the horizontal\ntemperature remained almost unchanged. We attribute\nthis heating either to the frequency noise on the rf signal when a synthesizer is used in FM mode for scheme\n(i) (see below) or to the discrete frequency steps in the\ncase of the DDS ramp (ii). During the following holding\ntime at constant rf frequency, the heating and lifetime\nwere very different for the two schemes. In scheme (i),\nthe heating was about 5 \u03bcK/s and the 1/e-lifetime was\nlimited to 360 ms. These features are clearly limited by\nthe noise on the rf signal in FM mode: For our Agilent\n33250A synthesizer used in this mode, we indeed measured a jitter at a given rf frequency during 1 s ranging\nfrom about 8 Hz FWHM for a 2 MHz modulation depth\n(which we use to produce a 2 MHz sweep between 1 and\n3 MHz) to about 100 Hz FWHM for a 10 MHz modulation depth. These figures have to be compared to\nits sub-mHz spectral width if this same synthesizer were\nused in a fixed frequency mode. Note that these values\nstrongly depend on the synthesizer. On the contrary, for\nscheme (ii) we observed a thermalization between the x\nand z directions in about 340 ms (figure 3) but no heating during holding time, and could obtain lifetimes as\nhigh as 4.5 s. This lifetime may be due to Landau\u2013Zener\ntransitions to untrapped states.

At this value, the expanding cloud\nis still anisotropic. The x data are fitted with an exponential\nfunction. The deduced thermalization time is 340 ms. The\nequilibrium temperature measured along z is 3.6 \u03bcK, obtained\nby a fit to the z data by a constant function.\n\nand holding rf synthesizers had a dramatic effect on the\natom number; when the phase jump was close to \u03c0 (phase\nreversal) we observed a strong atom loss with typically\nfive times less atoms remaining trapped as compared to\nquasi-continuous phase occurrences.\nIn conclusion, we were able to trap ultracold atoms in\na new kind of anisotropic trap, produced with the same\ntools broadly used for obtaining a BEC, that is a magnetic trap and a rf field. This trap may be well suited\nfor confining BECs in lower dimensions. We confined\nthermal clouds in this egg shell trap without noticeable\nheating and measured a lifetime up to 4.5 s. Defects in\nthe rf sweep during the loading stage induced heating and\nprevented us from producing a 2D BEC in this trap. The\n\n[1] O. Zobay and B.M. Garraway, Phys. Rev.

Another issue will then arise, as the loading\nphase is likely to produce excitations along the long axis\nx of the egg shell trap, with oscillation frequency on the\norder of a few Hz only. To avoid these longitudinal excitations, we experimented evaporative cooling directly\ninside the egg shell trap using scheme (i) together with\nan additional rf field as proposed in [1]. This could be a\nsuitable means to achieve BEC in this trap, starting with\na thermal cloud. However, this cooling mechanism could\nnot overcome the noise-induced heating present during\nthe holding phase in scheme (i). This evaporative method\napplied to scheme (ii) should give positive results.\nFinally, the principle of adiabatic trapping may be associated to optical fields in order to produce new trapping\ngeometries. In association with a red detuned vertical\nstanding wave, the egg shell trap could be a way to load\na single optical antinode [23]. Once the atoms fill a single\nantinode, a further increase of the rf detuning \u2206 pushes\nthe atoms along the iso-B shell outwards the centre of the\npancake. One ends up with a ring trap of about 1 mm in\ndiameter, with high oscillation frequencies along the two\ntransverse directions due either to the vertical standing\nwave or to the rf induced avoided crossing of the Zeeman sublevels. Neutral atoms were already confined in\ncm scale magnetic storage rings [24]. Our 1D ring would\nhave no local coupling to an external atomic source, and\nhence no local defect. It represents a tool well adapted\nto the study of permanent superfluid current.\nWe gratefully acknowledge support by the R\u00e9gion Ile-deFrance (contract number E1213) and by the European Community through the Research Training Network \"FASTNet\"\nunder contract No. HPRN-CT-2002-00304.
