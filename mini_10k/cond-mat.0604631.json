Anderson localization in disordered\nsystems with one-dimensional geometry is one of such\nmodels. Historically, it played an important role in setting down the concept of quantum localization. The\nmodel of a one-dimensional (1D) chain was the first example of the system where localization takes place at\narbitrary weak disorder [1, 2]. Later on Thouless [3]\nargued that all the states are localized also in disordered quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) systems, supporting\na large number N \u226b 1 of propagating transverse modes.\nDuring the last three decades it had been realized that\nmany problems of condensed matter physics and quantum chaos can be mapped onto Q1D localization. The\nmost natural example is particle propagation in a disordered wire, both in the limit of weak [4] and strong (granular) [5] disorder. Besides that, the problem of random\nbanded matrices with a large bandwidth can be mapped\n[6] onto the same model. The problem of the quantum\n\u03b4-kicked rotor [7, 8] whose evolution operator looks like\na quasi-random banded matrix also belongs [9, 10] to the\nQ1D universality class. Recently it was argued [11] that\ndynamic localization in quantum dots which can be described by time-dependent random matrices is equivalent\nto Q1D localization as well.\nDespite the fact that mathematical description of\nstrictly 1D disordered systems is rather involved [12, 13],\nour knowledge about them is quite complete. In this case,\nthe localization length \u03be1D coincides with the mean free\npath l. The low-frequency conductivity follows the MottBerezinsky law: Re \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 2 ln2 (1/\u03c9\u03c4 ) [12, 14], where\n\u03c4 is the elastic time. The correlation function of the local density of states (LDOS) was considered by Gor'kov,\nDorokhov and Prigara [15] who have shown that in the\nlimit of small energy separation, \u03c9\u03c4 \u226a 1, the eigenstates\nare uncorrelated at r \u226b \u03be1D ln(1/\u03c9\u03c4 ), exhibit nearly perfect level repulsion at \u03be1D \u226a r \u226a \u03be1D ln(1/\u03c9\u03c4 ), with a\ntendency to level attraction at r \u226a \u03be1D (for a discussion\nof these results using Mott's arguments, see Ref. [16]).\n\nIn the Q1D case, the localization length \u03be \u223c N l [17] is\nmuch larger than the mean free path, that allows to formulate the problem of Q1D localization on the language\nof the nonlinear supersymmetric \u03c3-model [4, 18] describing the physics of interacting diffusive modes. The latter\nproblem can be solved using the transfer-matrix technique introduced by Efetov and Larkin [19]. The idea\nof the method is to reduce the evaluation of the functional integral over the superfield Q(x) to the solution of\na differential equation, in analogy with constructing the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation from the Feynman path integral.\nHowever the resulting transfer-matrix equation at finite\nfrequencies \u03c9 appears to be too complicated (even in the\nsimplest unitary case), so that no results about correlations of different eigenfunctions had ever been obtained\nin the nonperturbative localized regime, \u03c9 < \u2206\u03be , where\n\u2206\u03be is the level spacing at the scale of the localization\nlength. Instead, one can solve the transfer-matrix equation in the limit of \u03c9 \u2192 +i0 thus extracting information\nabout statistics of the same wave function. In this way\none can find the localization length for various symmetry classes [19] and calculate the whole distribution function of a certain eigenfunction's intensity |\u03c8n (r)|2 [20].\nSimilarly, the low-frequency behavior of the dissipative\nconductivity in the Q1D case is not known up to now.\nThus we see that our knowledge about Q1D localization is far from being complete. This is a challenge since\nit is quasi- rather than strictly one-dimensional localization, which is important for various applications. The\nmain technical problem lies in the complicated form of\nthe transfer-matrix equations which did not allow to get\nany results concerning information about different eigenfunctions in the localized regime, \u03c9 < \u2206\u03be .\nIn this Letter we make the first step towards the theory\nof Q1D localization at finite frequencies by calculating\nthe correlation function of the LDOS\nR(\u03c9; r1 , r2 ) = \u03bd \u22122 h\u03c1\u03b5 (r1 )\u03c1\u03b5+\u03c9 (r2 )i\n\n(1)\n\nin a thick disorderedPwire in a magnetic field (unitary\nsymmetry); \u03c1\u03b5 (r) = n |\u03c8n (r)|2 \u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5n ), and \u03bd is the\n\n\f2\nR(\u03c9; r1 , r2 )\n1.4\n\nRcoins (\u03c9) = 1 + A(\u03c9) + B(\u03c9)\n1.2\n\n1\n0.8\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u03c9\n\u2206\u03be\n\nRclose (\u03c9) = 1 + A(\u03c9)\n\nwhich is smaller than 1 indicating level repulsion (bottom\ncurve in Fig. 1). However, this repulsion is weak enough,\nRclose (0) = 2/3, compared to the perfect level repulsion,\nR(0) = 0, in the random matrix theory. Surprisingly,\nthis value of 2/3 exactly coincides with the result [15]\nobtained for the strictly 1D geometry for \u03c9 \u2192 0 in the\nequivalent limit kF\u22121 \u226a r \u226a \u03be1D .\nWe start the technical section of this Letter by representing the correlation function (1) in terms of the retarded and advanced Green functions:\nR(\u03c9; r1 , r2 ) =\n\nFIG. 1: The LDOS correlation function vs. \u03c9/\u2206\u03be : at coincident points, Rcoins (\u03c9), and at kF\u22121 \u226a |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a \u03be, Rclose (\u03c9).\n\nthree-dimensional (3D) density of states for spinless particles. In the present paper we restrict ourselves to the\nlimit of sufficiently small spatial separations |r1 \u2212r2 | \u226a \u03be,\nwhen only the zero mode of the transfer-matrix equation\nis relevant. This zero mode is found exactly using the\nmapping onto an auxiliary 3D Coulomb problem. The\nexplicit expression (14) for the zero-mode wave function\nis the main technical achievement of this Letter.\nOur result for the LDOS correlation function in the\nlimit |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a \u03be has the form\nR(\u03c9; r1 , r2 ) = 1 + A(\u03c9) + k(r1 , r2 )B(\u03c9).\n\n(2)\n\nThe factor k(r1 , r2 ) = hIm GR (r1 , r2 )i2 /(\u03c0\u03bd)2 accounts\nfor Friedel oscillations [20, 21]. Its form is not universal\nand depends on the position of the points r1 and r2 with\nrespect to the boundaries of the wire. k(r1 , r2 ) is equal to\n1 at coincident points and decays fast as |r1 \u2212 r2 | exceeds\nthe Fermi wavelength 2\u03c0/kF .\nThe universal functions A(\u03c9) and B(\u03c9) determined by\nslow diffusive modes are insensitive to a particular geometry of the wire. They depend on the single dimensionless\nparameter \u03c9/\u2206\u03be , where \u2206\u03be = (4\u03c0 2 D\u03bd12 )\u22121 is the level\nspacing within the localization region (D is the diffusion\ncoefficient, \u03bd1 = A \u03bd, and A \u223c N kF\u22122 is the wire crosssection). The monotonous functions A(\u03c9) and B(\u03c9) are\ngiven explicitly by Eq. (16) and (17). The function A(\u03c9)\nis negative with A(\u221e) = 0 and A(0) = \u22121/3, whereas\nB(\u03c9) is positive with B(\u221e) = 0 and B(0) = 2/3.\nAt coincident points, the correlator Rcoins (\u03c9) = 1 +\nA(\u03c9) + B(\u03c9) is always larger than 1 signaling short-scale\nlevel attraction (top curve in Fig. 1).

This behavior should be contrasted with the \u03c9-independence of the same correlator\ncoins\nR1D\n(\u03c9) = 1 for strictly 1D chains [15].\nFor sufficiently close but different points, kF\u22121 \u226a |r1 \u2212\nr2 | \u226a \u03be, the correlation function (2) is nearly independent of |r1 \u2212 r2 | and equal to Rclose (\u03c9) = 1 + A(\u03c9)\n\nA\n1 RehGR\n\u03b5+\u03c9 (r1 , r1 )G\u03b5 (r2 , r2 )i\n.\n+\n2\n2\u03c0 2 \u03bd 2\n\n(3)\n\nThen we write GR and GA as the integrals over superfields and perform the standard sequence of steps leading\nto the Q1D unitary \u03c3-model [18] formulated in terms of\nthe supermatrix field Q acting in the direct product of the\nFermi\u2013Bose (FB) and Retarded\u2013Advanced (RA) spaces.\nThe resulting expression has the form\nZ\n1 1\nR(\u03c9; r1 , r2 ) = \u2212 Re P [Q]e\u2212S[Q] DQ(x),\n(4)\n2 2\nwith the usual diffusive action and the preexponent:\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c0\u03bd1\nD(\u2207Q(x))2 + 2i\u03c9\u039bQ(x) dx, (5)\nstr\nS[Q] =\n4\n\nAA\nRA\nAR\nP [Q] = QRR\nBB (x1 )QBB (x1 ) + k(r1 , r2 ) QBB (x1 )QBB (x1 ),\n(6)\n\nwhere str(. . . ) is the supertrace, \u039b = diag(1, \u22121) is a matrix in the RA space, and Qab\n\u03b1\u03b2 denotes a single element of\nthe Q matrix. In deriving P [Q] we have assumed that the\nfield Q does not fluctuate between the points xp\n1 and x2 ,\nwhich is true provided that |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a min(\u03be, \u03be \u2206\u03be /\u03c9).\nAs we will be mainly concerned with the localized regime,\n\u03c9 < \u2206\u03be , we will refer to this relation as |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a \u03be.\nSince the preexponent (6) depends only on Q in the\nsingle point x1 , the functional integral (4) can be written\nas\nover theR single supermatrix Q = Q(x1 ):\nR the integral\n\u2212S[Q]\nP\n[Q]e\nDQ(x)\n= P (Q)\u03a82 (Q) dQ, where \u03a8(Q) =\nR\n\u2212S[Q]\nDQ(x \u2265 x1 ). In the transfer-matrix apQ(x1 )=Q e\nproach, the function \u03a8(Q) is obtained as the zero-energy\nsolution of an appropriate supermatrix Hamiltonian [19].\nIn Efetov's parameterization [4, 18], \u03a8(Q) = \u03a8(\u03bb, \u03bb1 )\ndepends only on two variables: \u03bb and \u03bb1 , parameterizing\nthe FF and BB sectors of the supermatrix Q, respectively. Taking the integrals over the other variables of\nthe parameterization we obtain the following expressions\nfor the functions defined in Eq.

The zero\nmode in the deeply localized regime, \u03c9 \u226a \u2206\u03be , had been\nobtained in Ref. [19]. In this limit it depends only on\nthe noncompact\np bosonic variablep\u03bb1 and has the form\n\u22122i(\u03c9/\u2206\u03be )\u03bb1 K1 ( \u22122i(\u03c9/\u2206\u03be )\u03bb1 ), with\n\u03a8(\u03bb, \u03bb1 ) \u2248\nK1 being the MacDonald function.\nNow we show that the zero mode of the Hamiltonian (9) can be found exactly for an arbitrary \u03c9. The\nregion of variation of the parameters \u03bb and \u03bb1 suggests us\nto consider them as elliptic coordinates on the half-plane\ny > 0 of an auxiliary plane\np (x, y): \u03bb = (r\u2212r\np1 )/2 and \u03bb1 =\n(r+r1 )/2, where r = x2 + y 2 and r1 = (x \u2212 2)2 + y 2 ,\nsee Fig. 2. Changing variables from (\u03bb, \u03bb1 ) to (x, y) and\nintroducing a new function \u03a6: \u03a8 = r1 \u03a6, we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\nr12 r \u2202 2\n\u22022\n1 \u2202\ni\u03c9\n\u03a6 = 0.

Rotating the upper half-plane around the x axis by the angle\n\u03c6 we span the whole 3D space (the function \u03a6 is evidently\nindependent of \u03c6). The initial condition \u03a8(1, 1) = 1\ntransforms to \u03a6(r1 \u2192 0) = 1/r1 , which can be easily\nincorporated into the equation for \u03a6:\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n\u2207r + i\u03c9/2\u2206\u03be r \u03a6(r) = \u22124\u03c0\u03b4 (3) (r \u2212 r\u2032 ),\n(11)\n\nwhere r\u2032 is the 3D vector pointing from the origin to\nthe point (2,0,0), so that |r \u2212 r\u2032 | = r1 . Comparing with\nthe equation {\u22072r \u2212 2\u03b1/r + k 2 }Gk (r, r\u2032 ) = \u03b4 (3) (r \u2212 r\u2032 ),\nwhich defines the Green function in the Coulomb potential \u03b1/r at energy k 2 /2, we immediately conclude\nthat \u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0G0 (r, r\u2032 ) is nothing but the zero-energy\nGreen function in the field of an imaginary charge \u03b1 =\n\u2212i\u03c9/4\u2206\u03be . To avoid possible confusion we emphasize that\nthis 'zero-energy' refers to the auxiliary Coulomb problem, while the frequency \u03c9 can be arbitrary. We also note\nthat it is only the zero mode of the Hamiltonian (9) that\n\ncan be reduced to the Coulomb problem: for a finite E,\nthe equation H\u03a8 = E\u03a8 would correspond to the motion\nin a non-central field \u2212i\u03c9/4\u2206\u03be r \u2212 E/rr1 .\nSurprisingly, the Coulomb Green function has a very\nsimple form in the real-space representation. According\nto the seminal result by Hostler and Pratt [24],\ni\u0393(1 + i\u03b1\nk )\n(\u2202u \u2212 \u2202v )\n4\u03c0k|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\u00d7 W\u2212i\u03b1/k,1/2 (\u2212iku) M\u2212i\u03b1/k,1/2 (\u2212ikv), (12)\n\nGk (r, r\u2032 ) =\n\nwhere u = r + r\u2032 + |r \u2212 r\u2032 |, v = r + r\u2032 \u2212 |r \u2212 r\u2032 |, and W and\nM are Whittaker's confluent hypergeometric functions.\nTaking the k \u2192 0 limit of Eq. (12) with the help of the\nasymptotic formulae for Whittaker's functions [25], we\nobtain the Green function at zero energy:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(\u2202u \u2212 \u2202v ) u K1 (2 \u03b1u) v I1 (2 \u03b1v)\n. (13)\nG0 (r, r\u2032 ) =\n2\u03c0|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nIn order to get the function \u03a8(\u03bb, \u03bb1 ) one has to multiply \u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0G0 (r, r\u2032 ) by r1 that cancels the factor |r\u2212r\u2032 |\nin the denominator of Eq. (13), and express u and v in\nterms of \u03bb and \u03bb1 : u = 2(\u03bb1 + 1), v = 2(\u03bb + 1). Thus we\nobtain the explicit form of the zero mode of the Hamiltonian (9) valid for an arbitrary frequency \u03c9:\n\u03a8(\u03bb, \u03bb1 ) = K0 (p) qI1 (q) + pK1 (p) I0 (q),\n(14)\np\nwhere we have denoted p = \u22122i(\u03c9/\u2206\u03be )(\u03bb1 + 1) and\np\nq = \u22122i(\u03c9/\u2206\u03be )(\u03bb + 1). The properties of the Bessel\nfunctions ensure proper normalization: \u03a8(1, 1) = 1.\nThe form of Eq. (14) indicates that the initial coordinates \u03bb and \u03bb1 were somehow 'more natural' that\nthe auxiliary 3D Coulomb coordinates. Nevertheless we\nthink than the mapping to the Coulomb problem is important as it reveals the high symmetry of the transfermatrix Hamiltonian (9) related to the O(4) symmetry of\nthe Coulomb problem [26, 27].\nThe knowledge of the zero mode \u03a8(\u03bb, \u03bb1 ) allows us to\ncalculate A(\u03c9) and B(\u03c9) in Eqs. (7) and (8) analytically.\nThe integration for A(\u03c9) is done in terms of indefinite\nintegrals of the product of two Bessel functions. The\nintegral for B(\u03c9) is much simplified in the representation\nof the 3D Coulomb coordinates: B(\u03c9) = 4\u03c0 Re \u03b2(\u03c9) with\n\n\u03b2(\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 r G20 (r, r\u2032 ) = \u2212 \u2032\u2032lim \u2032 lim\n\nr \u2192r k\u21920\n\n\u2202Gk (r\u2032\u2032 , r\u2032 )\n, (15)\n\u2202k 2\n\nwhich is calculated using the exact expression\n(12). The\np\nresults for A(\u03c9) and B(\u03c9) read (\u03ba = \u22124i\u03c9/\u2206\u03be ):\nn \u0002\n\u0003\nA(\u03c9) = (4/3) Re \u03ba2 I12 (\u03ba) \u2212 I0 (\u03ba)I2 (\u03ba)\no\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7 K12 (\u03ba) \u2212 K0 (\u03ba)K2 (\u03ba) \u2212 I12 (\u03ba)K12 (\u03ba) ,\n\n(16)\n\n\f4\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nB(\u03c9) = (4/3) Re I1 (\u03ba)K1 (\u03ba) + 2I2 (\u03ba)K0 (\u03ba) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere we have used the properties of the Bessel functions\nand the fact that \u03ba2 is imaginary (\u03c9 is real) in order to\nsimplify the result. Exact Eqs. (16) and (17) interpolate\nbetween the metallic regime (\u03c9 \u226b \u2206\u03be ), which can be\ntreated perturbatively by expanding in diffusive modes,\nand the nonperturbative localized regime (\u03c9 \u226a \u2206\u03be ). The\nasymptotic expressions have the form (z = \u03c9/\u2206\u03be ):\n(\n\u22121/3 + z 2 ln2 (1/z)/3 + . . . , z \u226a 1,\nA(\u03c9) =\n(18)\n\u22123/(64z 2) + . . . ,\nz \u226b 1;\n(\n2/3 \u2212 2z 2 ln(1/z)/9 + . . . , z \u226a 1,\nB(\u03c9) = p\n(19)\n1/2z + . . . ,\nz \u226b 1.\n\nNow let us compare eigenfunctions' correlations in the\n1D and Q1D geometries. It is known that the single\neigenfunction statistics in the two cases are closely related\n[20]. Namely, the statistics of the wave function envelopes\nare precisely the same while the short-scale oscillations\nare different. Having derived the LDOS correlator in the\nQ1D case, we are now able to compare correlations of different eigenfunctions in the Q1D and 1D cases. The most\nstriking mismatch between the two problems is seen in\nthe LDOS correlation function at coincident points: our\nresult for Rcoins (\u03c9) is always > 1 with a nontrivial \u03c9coins\ndependence (top curve in Fig. 1), whereas R1D\n(\u03c9) \u2261 1\nfor the strictly 1D geometry [15]. However since the\nscales shorter than the Fermi wavelength can hardly be\nresolved (and with the results being model-dependent),\nit is more instructive to compare Rclose (\u03c9) at spatial separations |r1 \u2212 r2 | larger than kF\u22121 and smaller than the\nlocalization length (\u03be for Q1D, and\nR \u221el for 1D). For the 1D\nclose\ngeometry, R1D\n(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 (1/3) 0 dt t3 e\u2212t /[(\u03c9\u03c4 )2 + t2 ]\n[13, 15], which is definitely different from our result,\nclose\nRclose (\u03c9) = 1 + A(\u03c9). Though Rclose (0) = R1D\n(0) =\n2/3, already the next term in the small-\u03c9 expansion\n[\u03c9 2 ln2 (\u2206\u03be /\u03c9) vs. \u03c9 2 ln(1/\u03c9\u03c4 )] demonstrates the difference between the two problems even in the deeply localized regime. Thus we conclude that the analogy between\n1D and Q1D localization seen in the correlations of single wave functions, does not extend to the correlations of\ndifferent wave functions.\nFinally, we mention that the same approach can be\nemployed in calculating the density-density correlation\nfunction which determines the kinetic response of the\nwire. In the limit |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a \u03be we get a counterpart\nof Eq. (2) with 1 + A(\u03c9) and B(\u03c9) interchanged:\nR\nhIm GR\n\u03b5 (r1 , r2 ) Im G\u03b5+\u03c9 (r2 , r1 )i\n\n= (\u03c0\u03bd)2 [k(r1 , r2 )(1 + A(\u03c9)) + B(\u03c9)].\n\n(20)\n\nNote however that Eq. (20) is not sufficient to get the\nconductivity of the wire, which requires a much more\ncomplicated analysis of the limit |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u223c \u03be [18, 19].\n\nTo conclude, we obtained the explicit expression for the\nzero mode of the supersymmetric transfer-matrix Hamiltonian of a thick disordered wire in a magnetic field.\nThis allowed us to get the nonperturbative result for the\npair correlation function of LDOS, which describes correlations between different eigenfunctions, in the limit\n|r1 \u2212 r2 | \u226a \u03be. We demonstrate that these correlations\nare different in the 1D and Q1D cases. Generalization to\narbitrary |r1 \u2212 r2 | and other symmetry classes will be the\nsubject of further studies.\nWe thank D. M. Basko, M. V. Feigel'man, I. V. Gornyi,\nD. A. Ivanov, I. V.
