However, we believe their analysis is incorrect for two reasons, the first being the use of the free\nenergy density, G, rather than the total free energy \u03a9, to\ndetermine Rc . The second is their omission of the binding energy between fibers, which in classical nucleation\ntheory of spherical droplets corresponds to the driving\nforce for nucleation. We present a corrected version of\ntheir analysis below. Our approach is the same as that\nof Grason and Bruinsma [2], who determined the critical\nbundle size for aggregates of filamentous actin.\nAccording to classical homogeneous nucleation theory\n[3, 4], the critical \"droplet\" size corresponds to the minimum of the total free energy \u03a9 = R2 LG, which is significantly different from the energy density G. A simple example is the nucleation of a spherical droplet [3, 4]. The\nanalogous argument for the heterogeneous nucleation of\nthe fiber bundle involves calculating the total free energy\nrequired to create this bundle from an aggregate of fibers\nof (fixed) length L.\nThe energy of a twisted fiber as a function of pitch \u039b\nand radius R, includes the contributions from the surface\ntension, extension or compression, bending, twisting and\nbinding:\n\u03c0\n\u03a9\n= 2\u03b3R + ER2\n\u03c0L\n\n4 2\n\na R2\n16\n\n+\n\u039b4\n\n\u03c0 4 R4\n96\n\n\u2212\n\nR2 \u03c8\n\u2212 R2 \u000f\n\u039b\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the extensional modulus, a the radius of a\nprotofilament and L the fiber length. \u03c8 is related to the\ntwisting stiffness [1, 2]. Equation 1 contains an additional\nterm \u2212R2 \u000f due to the aggregation energy [3, 4] between\nfibers that is not present in Turner et al. [1]. The equi\u2202\u03a9\n|\u039b=\u039b\u2217 = 0, which\nlibrium pitch is determined by \u2202(\u03c0L\u039b)\n\u2217\n\n4/3\n\n4/3\n\n\uf065 =1 0 J m\n\n1 2\n\n\uf065 >1 9 0 J m\n\n1 0\n\n\u03a9( R ; \u039b * )\n\uf070L\n(1 0\n\n-1 4\n\nJ m\n\n-1\n\n\u22123\n\n, \uf067 = 5 . 4 \uf06dJ m\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n8\n\n\uf065 =3 8 J m\n\n) 6\n\n\u22123\n\n, \uf067 = 5 . 8 \uf06dJ m\n\n\u22122\n\n4\nR c =1 1 n m\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2 0\n\n4 0\n\n6 0\n\n8 0\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 2 0\n\n1 4 0\n\n7 4 0\n\n7 6 0\n\nR (n m )\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Plot of the free energy \u03a9(R; \u039b\u2217 )\nper unit length as a function of the fiber radius, R, using the experimental values for HbS given in the text for\n\u000f > 190Jm\u22123 (black), \u000f = 38Jm\u22123 (red), and \u000f = 10Jm\u22123\n(green). One local minimum occurs at R = 11nm which corresponds to the (metastable) equilibrium radius of HbS when\n\u000f = 38Jm\u22123 , \u03b3 = 5.8\u03bcJm\u22122 .\n\nCombining the estimate \u000f \u2248 38Jm\u22123 for HbS [5], this\nyields a value of Rc = 11nm and \u03b3 = 5.8\u03bcJm\u22122 ( Fig.\n1), which are consistent with experimental observations\n[1, 5]. A further reduction in \u000f leads to a decreasing value\nof \u03a9(Rc ; \u039b\u2217 ) (Fig. 1). We also note that the torsional\nrigidity obtained by Turner et al is the same in our calculation and in agreement with experimental values. Finally, there always is an energy barrier for the transition\nfrom dispersed protofilaments to the metastable bundle\nphase, which is incorrectly predicted as a spontaneous\nprocess in reference [1].\nThis work is supported by grants from the National\nScience Foundation (DMR- 0702890 ) and the G.

R = 0 and R \u2192 \u221e correspond to the phases of the\ndispersed protofilaments and stable crystal structures, respectively. As \u000f decreases below this, a local minimum\ndevelops in \u03a9(R; \u039b\u2217 ) whose position depends on \u000f and\n\u03b3.
