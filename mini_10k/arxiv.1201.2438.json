The extended environment\nof the Galactic Center (GC) provides an outstanding opportunity to study the dynamics of\ngas flow in a barred Galaxy and the relationship of molecular and atomic gas in the unique\nGC environment. Atomic hydrogen (H i) observations of this region offer a clear view of the\ngas dynamics at the center of our Galaxy, probing the transition between orbits associated\nwith the bar, circular orbits, and the beginnings of the spiral arms.\nThe spatial distribution of interstellar matter in the innermost 3 kpc has recently been\nreviewed by Morris & Serabyn (1996) and Ferri\u00e8re et al. (2007). The main structural features\nthat make up the GC region have been discussed extensively in the literature, including\nreviews by Blitz et al. (1993) and Genzel et al. (1994). Amongst the main structural features\ninside the GC are: both a long, thin bar (Hammersley et al. 2000; Benjamin et al. 2005;\nCabrera-Lavers et al. 2008) and a short, boxy-bulge bar (e.g. Blitz & Spergel 1991; Dwek\net al. 1995; Babusiaux & Gilmore 2005); the near 3 kpc arm (van Woerden et al. 1957; Oort\net al. 1958); and the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) covering the inner 150 - 250 pc (Morris\n& Serabyn 1996). More recently discovered features include the far-side 3 kpc arm (Dame\n& Thaddeus 2008), and a thin twisted 100 pc ring (Sawada et al. 2004; Martin et al. 2004;\nLiszt 2008; Molinari et al. 2011).\nStudies of the dynamics of gas, including high resolution CO observations (e.g Liszt\n& Burton 1978; Burton & Liszt 1992; Oka et al. 1998) and high sensitivity, low resolution\nH i (Liszt & Burton 1980), detail the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the\nCMZ. These data have constrained extensive models of the dynamics of the GC, including\nthose incorporating the effects of the bar(s) (e.g. Peters 1975; Binney et al. 1991; Fux 1999;\nRodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2006; Romero-G\u00f3mez et al. 2011).\nIn addition to Galactic dynamics, H i observations of the GC region may reveal any\nputative gas outflows from the GC. Much of the early analysis of the GC H i invoked largescale gas expulsive events (van der Kruit 1970, 1971; Sanders & Wrixon 1972) to explain the\nhighly non-circular motions observed in the H i emission envelope. Since Liszt & Burton\n(1980) showed that the forbidden velocity gas and its prevalence off the Galactic mid-plane\ncould be explained by a tilted-bar inducing elliptical gas streamlines the idea of large-scale\nneutral gas outflows has largely disappeared. However, due to lack of high-resolution data\nprobing small physical scales there is very little information about any small-scale outflows\nassociated with star formation at the GC. For example, we know nothing about whether\nthere is H i associated with the Galactic wind suggested by Bland-Hawthorn & Cohen\n(2003), despite evidence for cool and warm gas in the wind.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nLarge-scale surveys of the distribution of atomic hydrogen around the GC have a long\nhistory and include observations with the Dwingeloo 26m (van Woerden et al. 1957; van der\nKruit 1970), the Parkes 18m (Kerr 1967), an extensive Jodrell Bank survey of 355\u25e6 \u2264 l \u2264 10\u25e6 ,\n|b| \u2264 5\u25e6 , |v| \u2264 530 km s\u22121 (Cohen 1975), the NRAO 140-ft survey of 349\u25e6 \u2264 l \u2264 13\u25e6 , |b| \u2264\n10\u25e6 , |v| \u2264 350 km s\u22121 (Burton & Liszt 1978; Liszt & Burton 1980; Burton & Liszt 1983) and\nthe recent all-sky H i surveys: the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn survey (Kalberla et al. 2005) and\nthe Galactic All-Sky Survey (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2009; Kalberla et al. 2010). Although\nthe H i in the GC has been well-studied at low resolution, the large-scale environment is\nrelatively untapped at angular resolutions better than > 0.25\u25e6 . Braunfurth & Rohlfs (1981)\nconducted a slightly higher resolution, limited area, survey of |l| \u2264 1.5\u25e6 , |b| \u2264 1.5\u25e6 with\nthe Effelsberg 100m telescope, with a sampling grid and beamsize of 0.15\u25e6 . More recently\nLang et al. (2010) produced a high angular resolution survey of H i absorption, but only in\nthe central 1000 \u00d7 500 . Hence, there are currently no high-resolution H i datasets covering\nthe entire GC region to compare with detailed dynamical models and theories of molecular\ntransition (about 180\u2013250 pc from the GC, outside the CMZ, the nuclear disk has been\nthought to transition from molecular hydrogen to H i (Liszt & Burton 1978; Bitran et al.\n1997; Morris & Serabyn 1996)). Furthermore, the angular resolution of new infrared data on\nthe GC from Spitzer (Arendt et al. 2008) and Herschel (Molinari et al. 2010, 2011) exceeds\nthe resolution of existing H i data of the inner 3 kpc by more than an order of magnitude.\nIn this paper we describe the atomic hydrogen (H i) component of a survey of the\nGalactic Center conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and incorporating\nsingle dish data from Parkes. Here we take an intermediate approach, covering an area of\n10\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6 around the Galactic Center with an angular resolution of 145 arcseconds in atomic\nhydrogen (H i) and in 20 cm continuum. At a distance of 8.4 kpc (Ghez et al. 2008; Reid\net al. 2009) the survey covers about 1500 pc on all sides of the Galactic Center with a spatial\nresolution of about 6 pc. This survey builds on the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS;\nMcClure-Griffiths et al. 2005), VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS; Stil et al. 2006) and\nCanadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS; Taylor et al. 2003) to complete the International\nGalactic Plane Survey of the first, second and fourth Galactic quadrants. We discuss the\nobservations and data reduction of our Galactic Center H i survey (\u00a72 & \u00a73), present the\ndata cubes (\u00a74) and discuss noteworthy features (\u00a75). The data have been made publicly\navailable at: http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/HI/sgps/GalacticCenter.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nATCA Observations\n\nThe Galactic Center survey data were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray (ATCA) and the Parkes Radio Telescope. The Parkes data are from the Galactic AllSky Survey (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2009; Kalberla et al. 2010) and are described therein.\nThe ATCA observations were conducted between December 2002 and March 2004. The\nATCA consists of five moveable 22-m antennas on a 3-km east-west track and an additional\n22-m antenna at a fixed position 3-km west of the end of the track. Observations were\nconducted in six different array configurations: EW352, EW367, 750A, 750B, 750C, and\n750D. The array configurations were chosen to give optimum coverage of the inner u-v plane\nout to a baseline of 750 m. Data were recorded from the sixth antenna, with a maximum\nbaseline of 6 km, but these are not used in the image cubes presented here. The shortest\nbaseline is 31 m and every baseline, in intervals of 15.5m, to 245 m is sampled\nTo image the full 10\u25e6 \u00d710\u25e6 area the survey was conducted as a mosaic of many pointings.\nThe primary beam of the ATCA antennas, \u03bb/D = 330 , determines the optimum spacing\nbetween pointings, where \u03bb = 21 cm is the observing wavelength and D = 22 m is the\nATCA antenna diameter. The mosaic pointings were arranged on a hexagonal grid with\na separation of 200 . Although this is slightly wider than the optimum hexagonal spacing\n\u221a\nof (2/ 3)(\u03bb/2D) \u223c 190 , the theoretical sensitivity varies by less than 2% across the field.\nA total of 1031 pointings were required to cover the full area; 64 of these were previously\nobserved as part of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2005). The\n64 SGPS pointings were re-observed several times with the 750A and 750D arrays as part of\nthe Galactic Center project to help improve the u-v sampling of the longer baselines. The\noverall observing strategy was similar to that used for the SGPS and described by McClureGriffiths et al. (2005). The 967 new pointings were observed in 60s integrations approximately\n25 times at widely spread hour angles. We chose 60s integrations to mitigate against the\neffects of fluctuating sampler statistics caused by mosaicing very strong continuum sources.\nIn practice we found the first 10s sample was occasionally flagged as bad because of sample\nstatistics when the mosaic centre was moved to some of the pointings closest to (l, b) \u2248\n(0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ); samplers did not cause problems for the majority of the pointings. The 967 pointings\nwere divided into subfields of 42 or 36 pointings that were observed as continuous blocks.\nWithin each of these blocks the u-v coverage and integration time was essentially the same\nfor all pointings. Multiple blocks were observed during the course of each observing day\nand care was taken to ensure that the hour angle coverage for each block was as uniform as\npossible. An example of the u-v coverage for a pointing in the north-western corner of the\nfield is shown in Figure 1.\nThe ATCA has linear feeds, recording two orthogonal linear polarizations, X and Y .\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThese data were obtained prior to the Compact Array Broadband Backend upgrade (Wilson\net al. 2011), and therefore were recorded simultaneously in a narrowband spectral line mode\nwith 1024 channels across a 4 MHz bandwidth centered on 1420 MHz and a broadband\nmode recording 32 channels across a 128 MHz bandwidth centered on 1384 MHz. For the\nnarrowband mode that is the focus of this paper, only auto correlations, XX and Y Y were\nrecorded. All four polarization products, XX, Y Y , XY , and Y X were recorded in the\nbroadband mode. The broadband data will be the subject of a future paper.\n\n3.\n\nCalibration and Imaging\n\nData editing, calibration and imaging were performed in the Miriad package using standard techniques (Sault et al. 1995). The ATCA's primary flux calibrator, PKS B1934-638,\nwas observed at least once per day. PKS B1934-638 was used for bandpass calibration and\nprimary flux calibration assuming a flux of 14.86 Jy at 1420 MHz (Reynolds 1994). In addition, a secondary calibrator, PKS B1827-360, was observed for 2 minutes every \u223c 1 hr\nto solve for time varying complex gains. Gain solutions determined on PKS 1827-360 were\ncopied across to the Galactic Center pointings.\nData-editing, or flagging, was carried out by hand within Miriad. Although the 4 MHz\nband around the H i line is generally free from significant radio-frequency interference (RFI)\nthere was some intermittent locally generated RFI at 1420.0 MHz, apparent on the shortest\nbaselines. This was flagged by hand and after Doppler correction the flagged frequency\nchannels were spread around many velocity channels. However, in some cases the 1420.0\nMHz RFI constituted a significant amount of the short baseline data for channels in the\nvelocity range 95 km s\u22121 . v . 105 km s\u22121 . For these channels the noise in the final images\nis slightly higher and the image fidelity is generally worse than in other parts of the dataset\ndue to poor u-v sampling.\nContinuum emission was subtracted from the data in the u-v plane using a linear fit\nto ranges of channels on either side of the main H i line (Sault 1994). The ATCA does\nnot Doppler track so Doppler corrections were applied to the data after calibration and\ncontinuum subtraction and before imaging. The data were shifted to the IAU defined Local\nStandard of Rest (LSR) assuming a solar velocity Vsun = 20.0 km s\u22121 in the direction of RA =\n18h 07m 50.3s , \u03b4 = +30\u25e6 000 5200 , J2000.0. The continuum subtracted data of the individual\n1031 pointings were linearly combined to form a dirty image of the entire field. This approach\nto mosaicing, rather than the approach of combining the pointings after deconvolution, is\nmost effective at recovering information on the largest angular scales. Robust weighting, with\na robust factor of +0.7, was used in the imaging. This robustness was found to optimize the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsidelobe levels, synthesized beam size and overall noise for these images.\nThe Galactic Center region contains several very strong continuum sources which,\nwhen seen in absorption, appear as negative sources in the continuum subtracted H i line\ncubes. For the sources near (l, b) = (0.0\u25e6 , 0.0\u25e6 ) (Sgr A), (l, b) = (0.86\u25e6 , 0.07\u25e6 ) (Sgr B2) and\n(l, b) = (0.6\u25e6 , \u22120.05\u25e6 ) (Sgr B) the continuum flux is sufficient that absorption is observed\nin almost every channel where there is H i emission. The maximum entropy deconvolution\ntechniques traditionally used for large Galactic H i mosaics are not sufficient to deconvolve\ndiffuse emission in the presence of strong negative sources. The standard maximum entropy technique has a positivity constraint, which means that rather than deconvolving the\nstrongly negative sources, the sidelobes for these would be treated as structure in the H i\nemission and the algorithm would attempt to deconvolve these structures.\nIn order to deconvolve the H i cube we used a combined approach of maximum entropy\nand traditional CLEAN (H\u00f6gbom 1974). Before deconvolution of the diffuse H i emission we\ndeconvolved the strongest negative sources using the clean algorithm in Miriad's MOSSDI.\nDiffering from the technique employed by Stil et al. (2006), we did not filter out small uv distances because the continuum structure near (l, b) = (0.0\u25e6 , 0.0\u25e6 ) is extended and the\nabsorbed flux exceeds that of the diffuse emission by a factor of \u223c 20. After deconvolving\nthe absorbed emission, and taking care to not iterate so far as to start cleaning the diffuse\nemission, the clean-component model was subtracted from the u-v data. The resulting data\nwere then re-imaged and the H i emission deconvolved using Miriad's maximum entropy\nalgorithm, MOSMEM. To construct the final image cube we first created a 'residual' cube.\nThe residual is the difference of the clean-component model of the u-v subtracted dirty cube\nand the maximum entropy model convolved with the dirty beam. This residual image cube\nwas then combined with the clean and maximum entropy models convolved with a circular\nGaussian of 14500 . This combined maximum entropy and traditional clean technique proved\nquite effective, removing most of the sidelobe structure around the strongest continuum\nsources near \u22120.2\u25e6 \u2264 l \u2264 0.2\u25e6 , \u22120.2\u25e6 \u2264 b \u2264 0.2\u25e6 , plus toward (l, b) = (0.86\u25e6 , 0.07\u25e6 ) and\n(l, b) = (0.6\u25e6 , \u22120.05\u25e6 ).\n\n3.1.\n\nSingle-dish and Interferometer Combination\n\nAlthough mosaicing recovers information on angular scales up to \u03bb/(dmin \u2212 D/2) \u223c 360 ,\nwhere dmin = 31 m is the minimum baseline measured and D = 22 m for the ATCA,\ninformation on larger angular scales is lost to the interferometer. To recover information on\nlarger angular scales it has become common practice to combine the interferometric data\nwith images from a single-dish telescope. For this survey we use H i data cubes from the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nParkes Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS; McClure-Griffiths et al. 2009; Kalberla et al. 2010),\nwhich have an angular resolution of 160 and the same velocity resolution as the ATCA data\n(1 km s\u22121 ). The GASS data are significantly more sensitive than the ATCA data, with an\nrms brightness temperature of \u223c 55 mK, and therefore do not contribute significantly to the\nfinal noise of the survey presented here.\nThere are a number of techniques for combining single dish and interferometric data,\nincluding combination prior to deconvolution, during deconvolution and after deconvolution. The techniques and the merits of each are described in detail by Stanimirovi\u0107 (2002).\nFor ATCA data with moderate u-v sampling, experience has shown that the most robust\ntechnique is to combine the images in the Fourier domain after deconvolution. As implemented in Miriad's IMMERGE, the single dish and interferometric data are deconvolved\nseparately, then Fourier transformed, reweighted, linearly combined and then inverse Fourier\ntransformed. Mathematically, the Fourier transform of the combined image, Vcomb can be\nexpressed as:\nVcomb (k) = \u03c9 0 (k)Vint (k) + fcal \u03c9 00 (k)Vsd (k),\n(1)\nwhere Vint (k) is the Fourier transform of the deconvolved ATCA mosaic and Vsd (k) is the\nFourier transform of the deconvolved Parkes image. The weighting functions, \u03c9 0 (k) and\n\u03c9 00 (k), are defined such that \u03c9 0 (k) + \u03c9 00 (k) is a Gaussian whose full width at half-maximum\nis the same as the synthesized ATCA beam. In this way the ATCA data are down-weighted\nat the large angular scales and the Parkes data are down-weighted at the small angular scales.\nThe calibration factor, fcal , scales the Parkes data to match the flux scale of the ATCA data.\nThis factor is determined by comparing the ATCA and Parkes images at every pixel and\nfrequency in the range of overlapping spatial frequencies, which for an ATCA mosaic and\na Parkes image is 120\u03bb to 190\u03bb, for \u03bb = 21 cm. For GASS data and our ATCA image we\nfound a calibration factor fcal = 1.2.\n\n4.\n\nData product\n\nThe final combined H i cube was regridded to Galactic coordinates and converted to\nKelvins of brightness temperature, assuming filled emission on the scale of the ATCA synthesized beam. The cube covers the area \u22125.1\u25e6 \u2264 l \u2264 +5.1\u25e6 , \u22125.1\u25e6 \u2264 b \u2264 5.1\u25e6 with a pixel\nsize of 3500 and a beam size of 14500 . The velocity coverage is \u2212309 km s\u22121 \u2264 v \u2264 349 km s\u22121\nwith a channel spacing of 0.82 km s\u22121 and an effective velocity resolution of 1 km s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.1.\n\nData Quality and Artifacts\n\nThe sensitivity in the data cube varies slightly across the field because of observing\nstrategy used to cover the subregions. Figure 2 is an image of the rms brightness temperature sensitivity per channel created from the expected sensitivity based on the per pointing\nintegration time, scaled to the actual sensitivity as measured from the rms in off-line regions\nof the cube. Variations in rectangular patches are due to differences in the total number\nof snapshots on each sub-field. The remaining variations, in particular the increased rms\ntowards the Galactic Center and around the Galactic plane, in general are due to true increases in system temperature from the contributions of the strong continuum emission and\nbright H i, which fills most of the velocity band. The mean rms, \u03c3tb , per channel away\nfrom the Galactic plane is \u223c 0.7 K, increasing to \u223c 1.0 K at b \u223c 0\u25e6 and \u223c 2.0 K towards\n(l, b) = (0.0\u25e6 , 0.0\u25e6 ).\nIn general the mean rms measured in individual off-line channels is comparable to the\nchannel-to-channel rms measured in individual spectra. However, the spatial distribution of\nthe noise is not entirely constant with velocity. The velocity coverage differs slightly from\nfield to field and particularly for the data incorporated from the SGPS, which covered a\nslightly smaller range. As a result the noise increases for v < \u2212225 km s\u22121 and v > 267\nkm s\u22121 in the region that was originally covered by the SGPS, namely l < \u22123\u25e6 , |b| < 1.2\u25e6 .\nFigure 3 shows two example spectra at (l, b) = (358.0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) and (l, b) = (358.2\u25e6 , \u22123.8\u25e6 ).\nThese demonstrate the spectral baseline quality and spectral noise achieved in this survey.\nThe slight increase in rms at the extreme velocities is apparent in the spectrum obtained at\n(l, b) = (358.0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ).\nThe data cube contains some imaging artifacts. These fall into two main categories:\nthose associated with strongly absorbed continuum sources, and low-level artifacts due to\nlimited u-v coverage that lie near the noise level in individual channels. The most obvious\nimaging artifacts are those due to dynamic range limitations around the strongly absorbed\ncontinuum sources near (l, b) = (0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) and (l, b) = (\u22122.4\u25e6 , \u22120.1\u25e6 ). These regions are limited\nby incomplete cleaning, a problem that cannot be solved with the deconvolution techniques\nused here, but may be addressed in the future using Multi-scale clean (Cornwell 2008). There\nare a few pixels at (l, b) \u2248 (0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) in the GASS data that were saturated in the raw data\nat the time of observation. The limited dynamic range of the area immediately surrounding\nSgr A\u2217 , plus the lack of an accurate single dish image at this position, limits the usefulness\nof this dataset for studying the H i absorption towards Sgr A\u2217 . For studies of absorption in\nthe inner degree, users are advised to use the Lang et al. (2010) VLA survey.\nThe other category of imaging artifacts is apparent in images created by integrating\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nover large velocity ranges such as zeroth moment images, which show residual striping and\ncross-hatching. These effects are almost certainly due to the limited u-v coverage, although\nsome of the more prominent regions of parallel striping are clearly due to low-level RFI that\nhas not been completely flagged. In individual velocity channels these effects mostly lie\nbelow the noise.\nSmall spurious emission features appear at a velocity of v = +48 km s\u22121 at (l, b) =\n(3.77\u25e6 , \u22122.24\u25e6 ), (l, b) = (4.13\u25e6 , \u22122.57\u25e6 ) and (l, b) = (4.03\u25e6 , \u22121.73\u25e6 ). These bright, Tb \u223c 25\nK, features are only three velocity channels wide and are artifacts from the GASS data. No\ncounterparts to these features are observed in the ATCA-only data.\n\n5.\n\nImages\n\nImages of every tenth velocity channel are shown in Figure 4. The greyscale is different\nfor each panel as shown in the associated color wedges. The images highlight the wealth of\nsmall-scale features visible in these data. In Figure 5 we show longitude-velocity (l-v) images\nat latitude intervals of 0.1\u25e6 over the latitude range \u22121.4\u25e6 \u2264 b \u2264 +1.5\u25e6 . These are especially\nuseful for studying the large-scale structure of the region and can be compared usefully with\nexisting CO data (e.g. Bally et al. 1987; Oka et al. 1998).\n\n5.1.\n\nNoteworthy features\n\nFull analysis of these data will focus on the H i structure and dynamics of the Galactic\nCenter and an analysis of individual high-velocity features. These will be the topics of\nforthcoming papers. Here we restrict ourselves to a brief discussion of some of the most\nnoteworthy features.\n\n5.1.1.\n\nLarge-scale H i Distribution\n\nFigure 4 shows the H i sky distribution sampled every 8 km s\u22121 . The high velocities\n(|v| > 100 km s\u22121 ) show the well known (e.g. Kerr 1967; van der Kruit 1970; Burton & Liszt\n1978) H i emission structure of positive velocity gas at b < 0\u25e6 and l > 0\u25e6 and similarly,\nnegative velocity gas at b > 0\u25e6 and l < 0\u25e6 . Burton & Liszt (1978) and Liszt & Burton (1980)\nhave attributed this to a tilted H i inner disk which is oriented at 24\u25e6 with respect to the\nGalactic plane.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nOther well-known features are seen in the longitude-velocity (l-v) images shown in\nFigure 5, which are sampled at intervals of 0.1\u25e6 in latitude. In these we can see the\nprominent \"connecting arm\" at extreme positive longitudes and positive velocities (l > 3\u25e6 ,\n200 km s\u22121 \u2264 v \u2264 300 km s\u22121 ) and the nearly symmetric \"looping\" ridge at the extreme\nnegative longitudes and velocities (l < \u22121\u25e6 , v \u223c \u2212210 km s\u22121 ) . Fux (1999) modeled these\nfeatures as dust lanes on the near and far side of the bar, respectively. The near-side dust\nlane is particularly prominent at negative longitudes, whereas the far-side lane becomes quite\nclear at b \u2248 0\u25e6 .\n\n5.1.2.\n\nThe 3-kpc arms\n\nWhile the near 3-kpc arm has been well studied in H i at low resolution, both the near\n3-kpc arm and the recently discovered far 3-kpc arm are unexplored in H i at this resolution.\nFollowing the linear l-v fits of Dame & Thaddeus (2008) we constructed zeroth order moment\nmaps of the H i emission centered on the velocity mid-point of the near and far arms at every\nlongitude within the Galactic centre region, using a width in velocity of 26 km s\u22121 as used\nby Dame & Thaddeus (2008). These are shown in Figure 6. For most of the longitude\nrange covered by our Galactic Center survey the H i emission from the far arm is blended\nin longitude and latitude with both local gas and gas far outside the solar circle. While the\nnear arm is clearly visible in our data, the far arm is obviously confused by the Galactic\ncentre gas (l = \u00b11\u25e6 ) and also gas near l \u2248 3\u25e6 , which is associated with Bania's Clump 2 (see\n\u00a75.1.3 below). In the intermediate longitudes, particularly near l = 2\u25e6 and l = \u22122\u25e6 , there\nis a narrow strip of emission at b \u2248 0\u25e6 which may be attributed to the far 3 kpc arm. We\nnote, however, that the best evidence for the far 3-kpc arm presented by Dame & Thaddeus\n(2008) lies outside the longitude range of our survey. Figure 7 is a longitude-velocity (l-v)\ndiagram at b = 0\u25e6 with the linear fits of Dame & Thaddeus (2008) overlaid. The near 3-kpc\narm is clearly visible and hints of the feature identified as the far 3-kpc arm by Dame &\nThaddeus (2008) are also visible. The latter shows evidence of a possible split/bifurcation\nnear l \u2248 3\u25e6 , as was discussed by Dame & Thaddeus (2008).\nIn Figure 8, we show the integrated latitude profiles of the features shown in Figure 6.\nThese are summed from the non-confused portions of each feature, and as such the far 3-kpc\narm latitude profile contains H i emission from only about 2 degrees of longitude. As Dame\n& Thaddeus (2008) found for the CO emission, the latitude widths of the two arms in differ\nby a factor of \u223c2, with full-widths at half-max (FWHMs) in H i of 1.6\u25e6 and 0.7\u25e6 for the\nnear and far arms, respectively. Assuming a distance of the 3-kpc arm structure from the\nGalactic centre of 3.5 to 4 kpc, and a solar distance of 8.4 kpc (Ghez et al. 2008; Reid et al.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n2009), these correspond to a FWHM in z of 126 \u2212 141 pc and 149 \u2212 155 pc for the near and\nfar arms, respectively. Our values differ slightly from the estimates of Dame & Thaddeus\n(2008), which were calculated over the longitude range 5\u25e6 \u2264 l \u2264 9\u25e6 and using slightly different\nestimates for the solar distance and Galactocentric radius of the 3-kpc arms. If we use the\nsame distance values as Dame & Thaddeus (2008) (5.2 kpc and 11.8 kpc) we find z FWHM\nvalues of 149 and 146, respectively. Dame & Thaddeus (2008) used the comparable z heights\nof the two features as evidence for the far 3kpc arm. They also postulated that the small\nFWHM is due to a lack of star formation to heat and inflate the gas. However Green et al.\n(2009) showed high-mass star formation to be present in both arms through the association\nof 6.7-GHz methanol masers, known tracers of high-mass star formation. This implies that\nboth arms have undergone star formation activity and any effect on z height is the same for\nboth.\n\n5.1.3.\n\nBania's Clump 2\n\nThere are a few positions in the Galactic Center region that are known to have very\nwide linewidths over an extent > 0.5\u25e6 (Bania 1977). These have been observed extensively\nin 12 CO (Bania et al. 1986; Stark & Bania 1986; Liszt 2006), OH (Boyce & Cohen 1994) and\nother molecular line tracers (Lee 1996; Huettemeister et al. 1998; Liszt 2006), as well as in\nH i (eg. Riffert et al. 1997). The area known as Bania's Clump 2 at l \u223c 3.2\u25e6 , b \u223c +0.3\u25e6 was\nmapped in H i by Riffert et al. (1997) using the Effelsberg 100m telescope, showing an H i\nlinewidth of \u223c 100 km s\u22121 over the range 0 km s\u22121 \u2264 v \u2264 200 km s\u22121 and implying an H i\nmass of 1.5 \u00d7 105 M . High resolution CO maps by Stark & Bania (1986) suggest the region\nhas a mass of 106 M made up of approximately 16 individual clumps.\nThe physical interpretation of the wide-linewidth molecular clouds has been the subject\nof several studies. Stark & Bania (1986) interpreted Clump 2 as a dust lane. Liszt (2006,\n2008), however, suggested that the linewidths and extended vertical structure of the clouds\ncan be explained by molecular cloud shredding due to orbits associated with the bar. In\nparticular, Bania's Clump 2 is thought to be a gas cloud that is about to enter a dust lane\nshock. This is a similar model to that of Fux (1999), where the dust lane shock is the\nConnecting Arm, but in the Liszt (2008) model the dust lane is at a lower velocity, v \u223c 150\nkm s\u22121 , than the Connecting Arm. The Liszt (2008) model attributes the latitude extent of\nClump 2 to a transition from gas near the Galactic midplane to gas associated with the dust\nlane, which is located below b = 0\u25e6 . This is supported by the fact that the emission from\nClump 2 does not extend below the tilted disk, as observed at v \u223c 136 km s\u22121 in Figure 4g.\nBania's Clump 2 is clearly seen in the H i channel maps shown in Figs 4f & 4g over the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nvelocity range 79 km s\u22121 \u2264 v \u2264 144 km s\u22121 , as well as in the l-v images shown in Figs 5c &\n5d over the latitude range +0.2\u25e6 < b < +0.9\u25e6 . The cloud forms a very clear arc and appears\ncomplemented by another arc opposite at l \u223c 1.5\u25e6 . The feature at l \u223c 1.5\u25e6 is another\nwell-known broad line molecular cloud (e.g. Liszt 2008; Tanaka et al. 2007). The looping\nstructure of Clump 2 is also visible in CO (see Fig 3 of Liszt 2008). No model has been\nsuggested to explain the apparent morphological connection between the l \u223c 1.5\u25e6 cloud and\nClump 2.\nSlices taken in latitude and longitude across Clump 2, as shown in Figure 9, show very\nsharp edges towards the \"interior\", with a more gradual decline to the exterior. Similar\nstructure was observed in the Galactic supershell GSH 277+00+36, where the sharp edges\nwere attributed to compression on the interior edge of a supershell (McClure-Griffiths et al.\n2003). In the present case, it may also be possible that the complementary looping structures\nare walls of a supershell. In fact, the cloud at l \u223c 1.5\u25e6 itself was described as a nascent\nsuperbubble by Tanaka et al. (2007), who presented observations of several small expanding\nobjects within the larger cloud complex. However, there is no clear evidence for massive\nstar formation to power this feature (Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2006). Furthermore, there\nis no evidence of expansion over the wide range of velocities observed. The walls appear\nlargely stationary with velocity. It therefore seems unlikely that these wide-line clouds are\npart of an expanding supershell, but more likely the Liszt (2008) interpretation that both\nof these clumps are molecular clouds entering the dust lane shock is correct. In this case\nthe compression along the low longitude edge of Clump 2 would suggest that the gas there\nis already being shocked and that the shock emanates from the side nearest to the Galactic\nCenter. Interestingly there is little evidence for extremely sharp walls in the cloud at l \u223c 1.5\u25e6 .\nBally et al. (2010) focused on the structure of Bania's Clump 2, particularly as it pertains\nto 1.1-mm dust emission from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey. Bally et al. (2010) show\nthat Bania's Clump 2 contains dozens of 1.1-mm sub-clumps, which are differing in near\nand mid-infrared emission, suggesting that they are either inefficient at forming stars or are\npre-stellar. Bally et al. (2010) go on to suggest that the lack of star formation is due to high\npressures or to large non-thermal motions, such as might be expected if the cloud is located\neither where the x1 orbits, i.e. those parallel to bar, become self-intersecting, leading to cloud\ncollisions, or if the cloud is located where a spur encounters a dust lane at the leading edge\nof the bar. The H i emission structure, particularly the sharp walls, is consistent with the\nshock picture.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nGalactic outflows and loops\n\nFigure 10 is a velocity channel image at v = 163 km s\u22121 showing several very small cloudlike features lying at high Galactic latitudes. Clouds like these are apparent throughout the\ncube at high (|v| > 130 km s\u22121 ) velocities, as well as at lower velocities where they are\nquite distinct from the emission related to large-scale Galactic structure, such as a tilted\ndisk (e.g. Liszt & Burton 1980). We find over 60 separate compact clouds in the survey area\nat velocities |v| > 80 km s\u22121 . The properties of the detected clouds vary but typical angular\nsizes are 0.1 \u2212 0.5 deg, with a few larger clouds. Most of the detected clouds are faint, with\nbrightness temperatures of \u223c 3 \u2212 10 K. Several clouds have very narrow velocity linewidths\n(\u223c 2 km s\u22121 ), but most have linewidths in the range 7 \u2212 20 km s\u22121 . Rough mass estimates\nassuming optically thin emission and a distance of 8.4 kpc (Reid et al. 2009) are in the range\n250 \u2212 1500 M . In terms of physical properties these clouds are very similar to those found\nby Ford et al. (2010) towards inner Galaxy tangent points.\nIn addition to the compact discrete clouds, there are cohesive structures like that shown\nin Figure 4c (bottom two panels), which forms an extended loop at l \u223c 359\u25e6 , b \u223c \u22123.5\u25e6\npointing back towards the Galactic Center with narrow linewidth clumps along it. These\nhigh velocity features are discussed further in McClure-Griffiths et al (2012, in prep) where\nwe elaborate on the distribution and properties of the clouds and consider the possibility\nthat they are associated with gas entrained in a Galactic outflow (e.g. Fujita et al. 2009).\nA well studied large-scale feature of the Galactic Center is the so-called Galactic Center\nlobe (Sofue & Handa 1984; Law 2010), which is traced in radio continuum, H\u03b1, and infrared\nemission extending more than a degree above the plane. There is no obvious H i signature\nof the Galactic Center lobe. This is not surprising, however, given that the hydrogen recombination lines are at very low LSR velocities of \u223c \u22125 km s\u22121 to \u223c 8 km s\u22121 (Law et al.\n2009), which are very crowded with H i emission. The magnetic Loop 1 of molecular gas\nproposed by Fukui et al. (2006), however, is easily visible in the bottom panels of Figure 4b\nat v \u223c \u2212130 km s\u22121 . The other loop proposed by same authors is less obvious in H i.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nThe ATCA H i survey of the Galactic Center covers the inner 10\u25e6 \u00d710\u25e6 of the Milky Way,\nproviding a new resource for high-angular resolution surveys of the structure and dynamics\nof neutral gas in the central 3 kiloparsecs of the Milky Way. We present the final H i data\ncube with an angular resolution of 14500 and a velocity resolution of 1 km s\u22121 . The mean\nrms Tb across the full area is \u223c 0.7 K, varying from 0.5 K to 2.0 K, with the highest noise\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ntowards (l, b) = 0\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 .\nThis survey completes the International Galactic Plane Survey (McClure-Griffiths et al.\n2005; Stil et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2003) H i survey of the inner Milky Way, providing the link\nbetween the first and fourth Galactic quadrants. The data will be valuable for comparison\nwith existing high angular resolution surveys of Galactic Center at all wavelengths. Comparison with CO (Dame et al. 2001; Oka et al. 1998) and infrared data (Molinari et al. 2011;\nArendt et al. 2008) will help improve models of the inner Galaxy structure, while comparison\nwith radio continuum and high energy emission may reveal the nature of the outflowing gas.\nHere we have discussed briefly some of the more noteworthy features including the near and\nfar 3-kpc arms, a wide linewidth molecular cloud (Bania's Clump 2) and small high velocity\nclumps.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the extended support of ATCA staff for the Southern Galactic Plane Survey projects, without whom these surveys would not have been possible, in\nparticular, Mark Wieringa and Robin Wark. We are grateful to Katherine Newton-McGee\nfor her assistance with data editing and initial calibration. NMMc-G and JAG thank Thomas\nDame for his comments on the H i in the far 3-kpc arm.\n\nREFERENCES\nArendt, R. G., Stolovy, S. R., Ram\u0131\u0301rez, S.

The color scale is shown in the wedge at the\nright and varies linearly from 0.6 - 2.5 K. The contours are at 0.5 - 2.0 K in increments of\n0.25 K. The sensitivity is not completely uniform due to: (1) slightly uneven u-v coverage\nof the individual fields that make up the mosaic and (2) bright continuum sources, which\nincrease the system temperature and (3) broad H i linewidths toward b = 0\u25e6 , which occupy\na large fraction of the observing bandwidth and increase the system temperature.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Example spectra towards two positions, near (l, b = \u22122.0\u25e6 , 0.0\u25e6 ) and far (l, b =\n\u22121.8\u25e6 , \u22123.8\u25e6 ) from the Galactic plane.
