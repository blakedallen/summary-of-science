For example, pseudospin quantum\nHall ferromagnet of broken SU(2) symmetry has been realized by bringing two\nLandau levels close to degeneracy in a bilayer quantum Hall system [1]. In the\npast several years, the exploration of collective states in other multi-component\nquantum Hall systems has emerged [2, 3, 4, 5]. Here we show the conventional\npseudospin quantum Hall ferromagnetic states with broken SU(2) symmetry\ncollapsed rapidly into an unexpected state with broken SU(4) symmetry, by inplane magnetic field in a two-subband GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron\nsystem at filling factor around \u03bd = 4. Within a narrow tilting range angle of 0.5\ndegrees, the activation energy increases as much as 12 K. While the origin of\nthis puzzling observation remains to be exploited, we discuss the possibility of\na long-sought pairing state of electrons with a four-fold degeneracy.\nThe studies of multi-component quantum Hall systems so far have been limited to systems\nwith a SU(2) symmetry. Very recently, interest has been further extended to systems with a\nhigher order symmetry, such as SU(4), motivated mainly by the surge of research in graphene,\nwhere the two-fold spin and two-fold valley degeneracy lead to a four fold degeneracy [6, 7].\nThe SU(4) symmetry can be readily created in a multi-component quantum Hall system. For\na typical two subband semiconductor heterostructure, where both the symmetric and antisymmetric subbands of the confined quantum well are occupied, two distinct sets of Landau\nlevels are present. Through varying the density or magnetic field, levels with different Landau\norbital indices originating from the two subbands can be brought into degeneracy. Due to\nthe very small energy difference of the spin-splitting in GaAs [2, 3, 8, 9, 10], the system can\nprovide us with the desired SU(4) symmetry. The experimental studies presented in this\npaper are specifically focused on this interesting physical regime.\nThe sample was grown by molecular-beam epitaxy and consists of a symmetrical\nmodulation-doped 24 nm wide single GaAs quantum well bounded on each side by Si \u03b4doped layers of AlGaAs with doping level nd = 1012 cm\u22122 . Heavy doping creates a very\ndense 2DEG, resulting in the filling of two subbands in the well. As determined from the\nHall resistance data and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal resistance, the\ntotal density is n = 8.0 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , where the first and the second subband have a density\n2\n\n\fof n1 = 6.1 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 and n2 = 1.9 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 . The sample has a low-temperature\n\nmobility \u03bc = 4.1 \u00d7 105 cm2 /V s, which is extremely high for a 2DEG with two filled sub-\n\nbands. The samples are patterned into Hall bars using standard lithography techniques. A\nNiCr top gate is evaporated on the top of the sample, approximately 350 nm away from the\ncenter of the quantum well. By applying a negative gate voltage on the NiCr top gate, the\nelectron density can be varied continuously. Magneto-transport measurements were carried\nout in an Oxford Top-Loading Dilution Refrigerator with a base temperature of 15 mK and\na in situ motorized rotating stage with a resolution better than 0.01 degree. To measure\n\nthe longitudinal and Hall resistance Rxx and Rxy , we used a standard ac lock-in technique\nwith electric current ranging from 10 nA to 100 nA at a frequency of 11.3 Hz. Two devices\nfrom the same wafer were studied, and they have produced remarkably identical results. For\nconsistency, however, we present the data from only one sample.\nIn this experiment, we have concentrated our study around \u03bd = 4, where four energy\nlevels are filled. In the absence of an in-plane magnetic field (i.e., with zero tilting angle),\nwe have essentially reproduced the results of earlier studies [3, 10]on devices from the same\nwafer. The topology of longitudinal resistance Rxx in the density(n)-magnetic field(B)\nplane exhibits a square-like structure around \u03bd = 4, as shown in Fig. 1a. Here, point B\ncorresponds to the degeneracy point of |(S, 1, \u2193)i and |(A, 0, \u2191)i while point C corresponds\n\nto that of |(S, 1, \u2191)i and |(A, 0, \u2193)i, as illustrated schematically in Fig.(1f). Here we label the\nsingle-particle levels (i, N, \u03c3), and i(= S, A), N, and \u03c3(=\u2191, \u2193) are the subband, orbital and\nspin quantum numbers. One prominent feature is the disappearance of the extended states\n\n(i.e., bright lines) that complete the two-arms of the square. The disappearance is due to\nthe pseudospin gaps of easy-axis quantum Hall ferromagnetic states where the electrons are\nsuddenly transferred from (S, 1, \u2193) to (A, 0, \u2191), and from (S, 1, \u2191) to (A, 0, \u2193), or vice versa\n[2, 10, 11].\n\nNow we turn our attention to the behavior of the topology phase diagram in the tilted\nmagnetic field. The density(n)-perpendicular magnetic field(B\u22a5 ) phase diagrams of Rxx at\nseveral tilted angles \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 , 4.62\u25e6 , 5.82\u25e6 , 6.02\u25e6 , 6.32\u25e6 for \u03bd = 4 are shown in Fig.(1). Here the\nangle \u03b8 is defined as tan \u03b8 =\n\nBk\n.\nB\u22a5\n\nWhen the titling angle is increased to 4.62\u25e6 , Fig.(1b), the\n\nsize of the square, a measure of the energy separation between the two degeneracy points,\nshrinks only slightly. However, to increase merely another 1-degree, the two \"arms\" of the\nsquare structure almost collapse together, Fig.(1c), and become one point at slightly larger\nangles, Fig.(1d),(1e). The evolution of the positions of the anti-crossing points B and C\n\n3\n\n\f(roughly in the middle of each of the \"arms\" of the square structure at \u03bd = 4, also the local\nminimum of energy gap in the anti-crossing region), are plotted in Fig.(2) as a function of\nthe tilting angle (See also the movie in the supplement). One can clearly visualize that the\ntwo points get close with each other in a narrow range of tilting angle and emerge as one\npoint when \u03b8 is increased, which implies four Landau levels are brought into degeneracy. In\nother words, the two degeneracy points with a SU(2) symmetry become a single degeneracy\npoint with a SU(4) symmetry.\nSince there seems to be a drastic change in the characteristics of the phase diagram, in\na very narrow range of the in-plane magnetic field, it is natural to obtain a measurement of\nthe energy scale of the associated energy gaps there. In Fig.(3), we present the \u03b8 dependence\nof the energy gap Ea , deduced from the thermal activation relation \u03c1xx \u223c exp(\u2212Ea /2T ), at\n\ntwo points B, C marked by the dots in Fig.(1). The energies are found to be nearly constant,\n\n\u2248 3 K before \u03b8 = 5.82\u25e6 , while increasing sharply for a small angle region into a rough angle\n\nindependent region \u2248 15 K. Without any assist of theoretical analysis, the raw data strongly\n\nsuggests a phase transition.\n\nBefore we speculate on the physical origin of the observations, we would like to compare\nthe current experiment with others in similar 2DEG systems in the presence of an in-plane\nmagnetic field. There are indeed examples of in-plane magnetic field induced phase transitions in multi-component quantum Hall systems. The system studied by Murphy et al. [12],\na strongly coupled double quantum well at a filling factor \u03bd = 1, showed a relatively large energy gap change when the tilted angle was increased. It is now commonly believed that this\nchange reflects a commensurate to an incommensurate phase transition in the pseudospin\nfield. However, in this case, only the two lowest Landau levels are involved before and after\nthis quantum phase transition, in contrast to four Landau levels degeneracy in our system.\nIn a recent study of Si-SiGe heterostructures by Lai et al. [4], the \u03bd = 3 and 5 valley gaps\nrise rapidly when the angle of tilting approaches about 65\u25e6 . In this experiment, the effect is\ndriven by the coincidence of two different Landau levels when the Zeeman splitting becomes\ncomparable to the cyclotron energy, which is not possibly consistent with our small tilting\nangle. In another recent study of the 2DEG in a AlAs quantum well by Vakili et al. [5],\nthe size of the energy gap of \u03bd = 3 valley changes rapidly through a coincidence angle of\nabout 65\u25e6 . The change is induced also by the crossing of two different Landau levels, made\npossible again by the large tilting angle.\nChanges in the energy gap Ea normally reflect changes in the spectrum of charged excita-\n\n4\n\n\ftions and the 2DEG ground state. At first sight, one might expect that the phase transition\nis induced by the spin and pseudospin flips due to variations in the Zeeman energy g\u03bcB Btot .\nThe Zeeman energy, however, changes only about 30 mK upon tilting from \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 to 10\u25e6 as\nthe total magnetic field changes only about 10 percent, which is negligibly small compared\nto the observed change 10 K in Ea . The in-plane magnetic field can also affect the magnetite\nof the exchange energy since the distributions of both the symmetric and anti-symmetric\nwavefunctions are expected to vary considerably when the in-plane magnetic field ranges\nfrom 0 at \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 to 0.8 T at \u03b8 = 8\u25e6 . However the sudden change of the activation energy\ncannot simply be due to the quantitative change of the exchange energy by the in-plane\nmagnetic field. First, the experimental data of the energy gap Ea is nearly constant in\na wide range of tilted angle \u03b8 at small in-plane fields, as shown in Fig.(3). We therefore\nexpect that the energy of the pseudospin states is rather insensitive to response relative to\nthe in-plane magnetic field. Second, we found that such a phase transition is totally absent\nat a filling factor \u03bd = 6.\nWe speculate the observations involve a quantum phase transition induced by an in-plane\nmagnetic field. There is a competition between two ground states, one of which, at \u03b8 < \u03b8c ,\ntakes advantage of Coulomb interactions by forming pseudospin quantum Hall ferromagnets\nand the other, which becomes a more favorable many-body configuration when \u03b8 > \u03b8c .\nFrom the energetic degeneracy of Landau levels before and after the critical point, we infer\nthat there is a symmetry change: from SU(2) to SU(4) symmetry in our system. As shown\nin the standard Landau level fan diagram (Fig.1f), at \u03bd = 4, there is a SU(2) symmetry\nat crossing points B and C. Since the two crossing Landau levels have opposite spins, the\nexchange energy is highly pseudospin dependent, and leads to an easy-axis quantum Hall\nferromagnet. As a result, the energy gap here represents an exchange energy penalty for a\npseudospin flip. In our system, as the tilted magnetic field increases, the B and C points\nare close to each other, which means a total of four Landau levels with different subband,\norbital, and spin indices are brought close in energy near the phase transition. Thus there is\na SU(4) symmetry at the region where B and C overlapped. Coupling of all four-fold levels\nmay give rise to a more complex many-body state. In light of this, the energy gap jump may\nbe due to suppression of the low energy excitations which originates from the formation of\na new ground state. One possibility is that, in this region, electrons with different spins and\nsubbands can pair up, condensed in a pseudospin-singlet pairing state of four-fold Landau\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nlevels as |Si = \u03a0k [C(S,1,\u2191),k\n+ ei\u03c6 C(A,0,\u2191),k\n][C(S,1,\u2193),k\n+ ei\u03c6 C(A,0,\u2193),k\n] |0i. In this new state, the\n\n5\n\n\felectrons condense in a superposition of states with different spins and subbands sharing the\nsame phase ei\u03c6 . Thus the energy gap of 15 K for \u03b8 > \u03b8c can be taken as a measurement of\nthe pairing strength of pseudospin coherence.\nAs far as we know, there are only a few theoretical investigations of two-fold and fourfold Landau level degeneracy in two-subband quantum Hall systems [13, 14]. Nevertheless,\nthere are quite a few theoretical studies of multi-fold degeneracy states in the coupled bilayer\nsystem. A soft barrier originating from Coulomb interaction among electrons in the quantum\nwell separates our system into effective strongly coupled bilayers. As a result, the associated\nwave functions with subband index can be transformed as those with layer index \u03a6L =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n[\u03a6AS + \u03a6S ]/ 2, \u03a6R = [\u03a6AS \u2212 \u03a6S ]/ 2. Thus we believe that the theoretical description of\nquantum Hall phenomenon in two-subband single wells only requires slight modifications of\nthe idealized bilayer model while retaining the basic results of the many-body Hartree-Fock\nformalism. On one hand, for an idealized bilayer model at filling factor \u03bd = 4 in zero inplane magnetic field, where two aligned Landau levels with different subband and orbital\nindices are brought into degeneracy, the ground state can be an easy-axis quantum Hall\nferromagnet dependent on the details of the system [11]. The quasiparticle energy gap of\neasy-axis quantum Hall ferromagnet is weakly dependent on the tilted angle [15], which is\nconsistent with our observations for \u03b8 < \u03b8c . On the other hand, for a bilayer system at \u03bd = 2,\nwhere sometimes four Landau levels are close to degeneracy, the ground state is theoretically\nstudied by several groups with the Hartree-Fock method [16, 17]. It was found that there are\nrich phases including ferromagnetic, spin-singlet, and canted phase and transitions between\nthem. In the presence of strong in-plane magnetic fields and large tunneling, the ground state\nis expected to be a spin-singlet state resulting from the pairing of two adjacent layers[17, 18].\nIn the present system, since the energy difference between the symmetry and antisymmetry\nstates, \u2206SAS , is as large as 0.75 e2 /\u03b5l, measured from Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, one\nexpects a similar pairing state of pseudo-spins, or sub-bands |Si when four Landau levels are\nbrought into degeneracy. Thus we can construct a phenomenological model as shown in the\nFig.(4), where the ground state is an ordinary easy-axis quantum Hall ferromagnet for the\ncase of two degenerate Landau levels and becomes a new state for four degenerate Landau\nlevels, when the electrons with different spins and subband pair up and coherence associated\nwith the phase ei\u03c6 is maintained. We speculate that similar SU(2) to SU(4) phase transition\nphenomenon can be observed in bilayer systems at some appropriate regions. Actually, the\nactivation energies we measured at \u03b8 > \u03b8c are consistent with the experimental values of\n\n6\n\n\fenergy gap of spin-singlet state in bilayer \u03bd = 2, which is about 15 K[19]. Of course, there\nare possibly different competing-orders, such as a stripe state with broken translational and\nspin symmetries, which is commonly believed to occur at very large in-plane magnetic fields\n[14, 20, 21]. More work is desired to calculate the ground state energy of the proposed SU(4)\nas a function of the in-plane field.\nIn summary, we find experimental evidence for intriguing and unexpected quantum phase\ntransition from the typical pseudospin quantum Hall ferromagnetic states with broken SU(2)\nsymmetry into a state with broken SU(4) symmetry driven by the in-plane magnetic field,\naround a filling factor of \u03bd = 4 in a two-subband GaAs-AlGaAs 2DEG. While the origin\nof this new state is unclear, we discussed the possibility of the pairing state of electrons\nwith different spins and subbands. More experiments, such as electrically detected nuclear\nmagnet resonance [22], are needed to further investigate the microscopic aspects of this\nquantum phase transition.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe authors would like to thank S.
