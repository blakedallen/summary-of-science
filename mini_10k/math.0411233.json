Introduction\nAn important problem in 4-manifold topology is to understand which\nmanifolds carry symplectic structures (i.e., closed non-degenerate 2-forms),\nand to develop invariants that can distinguish symplectic manifolds. Additionally, one would like to understand to what extent the category of\nsymplectic manifolds is richer than that of K\u00e4hler (or complex projective)\nmanifolds. Similar questions may be asked about singular curves inside, e.g.,\nthe complex projective plane. The two types of questions are related to each\nother via symplectic branched covers.\nA branched cover of a symplectic 4-manifold with a (possibly singular)\nsymplectic branch curve carries a natural symplectic structure. Conversely,\nusing approximately holomorphic techniques it can be shown that every\ncompact symplectic 4-manifold is a branched cover of the complex projective plane, with a branch curve presenting nodes (of both orientations) and\ncomplex cusps as its only singularities (cf. \u00a73). The topology of the 4manifold and that of the branch curve are closely related to each other;\nfor example, using braid monodromy techniques to study the branch curve,\none can reduce the classification of symplectic 4-manifolds to a (hard) question about factorizations in the braid group (cf. \u00a74). Conversely, in some\nexamples the topology of the branch curve complement (in particular its\nfundamental group) admits a simple description in terms of the total space\nof the covering (cf. \u00a75).\nIn the language of branch curves, the failure of most symplectic manifolds to admit integrable complex structures translates into the failure of\nFrom lectures given at the 2004 Clay Mathematics Institute Summer School on Floer\nHomology, Gauge Theory, and Low Dimensional Topology at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute,\nBudapest, Hungary (www.claymath.org/programs/summer school/2004/).\nPartially supported by NSF grant DMS-0244844.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\nmost symplectic branch curves to be isotopic to complex curves. While the\nsymplectic isotopy problem has a negative answer for plane curves with cusp\nand node singularities, it is interesting to investigate this failure more precisely. Various partial results have been obtained recently about situations\nwhere isotopy holds (for smooth curves; for curves of low degree), and about\nisotopy up to stabilization or regular homotopy (cf. \u00a76). On the other hand,\nmany known examples of non-isotopic curves can be understood in terms\nof twisting along Lagrangian annuli (or equivalently, Luttinger surgery of\nthe branched covers), leading to some intriguing open questions about the\ntopology of symplectic 4-manifolds versus that of K\u00e4hler surfaces.\n2. Background\nIn this section we review various classical facts about symplectic manifolds; the reader unfamiliar with the subject is referred to the book [19] for\na systematic treatment of the material.\nRecall that a symplectic form on a smooth manifold is a 2-form \u03c9 such\nthat d\u03c9 = 0 and \u03c9 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c9 P\nis a volume form. The prototype of a symplectic\nform is the 2-form \u03c90 =\ndxi \u2227 dyi on R2n . In fact, one of the most\nclassical results in symplectic topology, Darboux's theorem, asserts that\nevery symplectic manifold is locally symplectomorphic to (R2n , \u03c90 ): hence,\nunlike Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures have no local invariants.\nSince we are interested primarily in compact examples, let us mention\ncompact oriented surfaces (taking \u03c9 to be an arbitrary area form), and\nthe complex projective space CPn (equipped with the Fubini-Study K\u00e4hler\nform). More generally, since any submanifold to which \u03c9 restricts nondegenerately inherits a symplectic structure, all complex projective manifolds are symplectic. However, the symplectic category is strictly larger than\nthe complex projective category, as first evidenced by Thurston in 1976 [36].\nIn 1994 Gompf obtained the following spectacular result using the symplectic\nsum construction [14]:\nTheorem 1 (Gompf). Given any finitely presented group G, there exists a\ncompact symplectic 4-manifold (X, \u03c9) such that \u03c01 (X) \u2243 G.\nHence, a general symplectic manifold cannot be expected to carry a\ncomplex structure; however, we can equip it with a compatible almostcomplex structure, i.e. there exists J \u2208 End(T X) such that J 2 = \u2212Id and\ng(*, *) := \u03c9(*, J*) is a Riemannian metric. Hence, at any given point x \u2208 X\nthe tangent space (Tx X, \u03c9, J) can be identified with (Cn , \u03c90 , i), but there\nis no control over the manner in which J varies from one point to another\n(J is not integrable). In particular, the \u2202 \u0304 operator associated to J does not\nsatisfy \u2202 \u03042 = 0, and hence there are no local holomorphic coordinates.\nAn important problem in 4-manifold topology is to understand the hierarchy formed by the three main classes of compact oriented 4-manifolds: (1)\ncomplex projective, (2) symplectic, and (3) smooth. Each class is a proper\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\n3\n\nsubset of the next one, and many obstructions and examples are known,\nbut we are still very far from understanding what exactly causes a smooth\n4-manifold to admit a symplectic structure, or a symplectic 4-manifold to\nadmit an integrable complex structure.\nOne of the main motivations to study symplectic 4-manifolds is that they\nretain some (but not all) features of complex projective manifolds: for example the structure of their Seiberg-Witten invariants, which in both cases\nare non-zero and count certain embedded curves [31, 32]. At the same time,\nevery compact oriented smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 \u2265 1 admits a \"nearsymplectic\" structure, i.e. a closed 2-form which vanishes along a union of\ncircles and is symplectic over the complement of its zero set [13, 16]; and it\nappears that some structural properties of symplectic manifolds carry over\nto the world of smooth 4-manifolds (see e.g. [33, 5]).\nMany new developments have contributed to improve our understanding\nof symplectic 4-manifolds over the past ten years (while results are much\nscarcer in higher dimensions). Perhaps the most important source of new\nresults has been the study of pseudo-holomorphic curves in their various incarnations: Gromov-Witten invariants, Floer homology, . . . (for an overview\nof the subject see [20]). At the same time, gauge theory (mostly SeibergWitten theory, but also more recently Ozsvath-Szabo theory) has made it\npossible to identify various obstructions to the existence of symplectic structures in dimension 4 (cf. e.g. [31, 32]). On the other hand, various new\nconstructions, such as link surgery [11], symplectic sum [14], and symplectic\nrational blowdown [30] have made it possible to exhibit interesting families\nof non-K\u00e4hler symplectic 4-manifolds. In a slightly different direction, approximately holomorphic geometry (first introduced by Donaldson in [9])\nhas made it possible to obtain various structure results, showing that symplectic 4-manifolds can be realized as symplectic Lefschetz pencils [10] or as\nbranched covers of CP2 [2]. In the rest of this paper we will focus on this\nlatter approach, and discuss the topology of symplectic branched covers in\ndimension 4.\n3. Symplectic branched covers\nLet X and Y be compact oriented 4-manifolds, and assume that Y carries\na symplectic form \u03c9Y .\nDefinition 2. A smooth map f : X \u2192 Y is a symplectic branched covering\nif given any point p \u2208 X there exist neighborhoods U \u220b p, V \u220b f (p), and\nlocal coordinate charts \u03c6 : U \u2192 C2 (orientation-preserving) and \u03c8 : V \u2192 C2\n(adapted to \u03c9Y , i.e. such that \u03c9Y restricts positively to any complex line in\nC2 ), in which f is given by one of:\n(i) (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, y) (local diffeomorphism),\n(ii) (x, y) 7\u2192 (x2 , y) (simple branching),\n(iii) (x, y) 7\u2192 (x3 \u2212 xy, y) (ordinary cusp).\n\n\f4\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\nThese local models are the same as for the singularities of a generic holomorphic map from C2 to itself, except that the requirements on the local\ncoordinate charts have been substantially weakened. The ramification curve\nR = {p \u2208 X, det(df ) = 0} is a smooth submanifold of X, and its image\nD = f (R) is the branch curve, described in the local models by the equations z1 = 0 for (x, y) 7\u2192 (x2 , y) and 27z12 = 4z23 for (x, y) 7\u2192 (x3 \u2212 xy, y).\nThe conditions imposed on the local coordinate charts imply that D is a\nsymplectic curve in Y (i.e., \u03c9Y |T D > 0 at every point of D). Moreover the\nrestriction of f to R is an immersion everywhere except at the cusps. Hence,\nbesides the ordinary complex cusps imposed by the local model, the only\ngeneric singularities of D are transverse double points (\"nodes\"), which may\noccur with either the complex orientation or the anti-complex orientation.\nWe have the following result [2]:\nProposition 3. Given a symplectic branched covering f : X \u2192 Y , the manifold X inherits a natural symplectic structure \u03c9X , canonical up to isotopy,\nin the cohomology class [\u03c9X ] = f \u2217 [\u03c9Y ].\nThe symplectic form \u03c9X is constructed by adding to f \u2217 \u03c9Y a small multiple of an exact form \u03b1 with the property that, at every point of R, the\nrestriction of \u03b1 to Ker(df ) is positive. Uniqueness up to isotopy follows from\nthe convexity of the space of such exact 2-forms and Moser's theorem.\nConversely, we can realize every compact symplectic 4-manifold as a symplectic branched cover of CP2 [2], at least if we assume integrality, i.e. if we\nrequire that [\u03c9] \u2208 H 2 (X, Z), which does not place any additional restrictions\non the diffeomorphism type of X:\nTheorem 4. Given an integral compact symplectic 4-manifold (X 4 , \u03c9) and\nan integer k \u226b 0, there exists a symplectic branched covering fk : X \u2192 CP2 ,\ncanonical up to isotopy if k is sufficiently large.\nMoreover, the natural symplectic structure induced on X by the FubiniStudy K\u00e4hler form and fk (as given by Proposition 3) agrees with \u03c9 up to\nisotopy and scaling (multiplication by k).\nThe main tool in the construction of the maps fk is approximately holomorphic geometry [9, 10, 2]. Equip X with a compatible almost-complex\nstructure, and consider a complex line bundle L \u2192 X such that c1 (L) = [\u03c9]:\nthen for k \u226b 0 the line bundle L\u2297k admits many approximately holomorphic\n \u0304 \u226a sup |\u2202s|. Generically, a triple of\nsections, i.e. sections such that sup |\u2202s|\nsuch sections (s0 , s1 , s2 ) has no common zeroes, and determines a projective\nmap f : p 7\u2192 [s0 (p) : s1 (p) : s2 (p)]. Theorem 4 is then proved by constructing\ntriples of sections which satisfy suitable transversality estimates, ensuring\nthat the structure of f near its critical locus is the expected one [2]. (In the\ncomplex case it would be enough to pick three generic holomorphic sections,\nbut in the approximately holomorphic context one needs to work harder and\nobtain uniform transversality estimates on the derivatives of f .)\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\n5\n\nBecause for large k the maps fk are canonical up to isotopy through symplectic branched covers, the topology of fk and of its branch curve Dk can be\nused to define invariants of the symplectic manifold (X, \u03c9). The only generic\nsingularities of the plane curve Dk are nodes (transverse double points) of\neither orientation and complex cusps, but in a generic one-parameter family\nof branched covers pairs of nodes with opposite orientations may be cancelled or created. However, recalling that a node of Dk corresponds to the\noccurrence of two simple branch points in a same fiber of fk , the creation of\na pair of nodes can only occcur in a manner compatible with the branched\ncovering structure, i.e. involving disjoint sheets of the covering. Hence, for\nlarge k the sequence of branch curves Dk is, up to isotopy (equisingular deformation among symplectic curves), cancellations and admissible creations\nof pairs of nodes, an invariant of (X, \u03c9).\nThe ramification curve of fk is just a smooth connected symplectic curve\nrepresenting the homology class Poincar\u00e9 dual to 3k[\u03c9] \u2212 c1 (T X), but the\nbranch curve Dk becomes more and more complicated as k increases: in\nterms of the symplectic volume and Chern numbers of X, its degree (or\nhomology class) dk , genus gk , and number of cusps \u03bak are given by\ndk = 3k2 [\u03c9]2 \u2212 k c1 * [\u03c9],\n\n2gk \u2212 2 = 9k2 [\u03c9]2 \u2212 9k c1 * [\u03c9] + 2c21 ,\n\n\u03bak = 12k2 [\u03c9]2 \u2212 9k c1 * [\u03c9] + 2c21 \u2212 c2 .\nIt is also worth mentioning that, to this date, there is no evidence suggesting\nthat negative nodes actually do occur in these high degree branch curves;\nour inability to rule our their presence might well be a shortcoming of the\napproximately holomorphic techniques, rather than an intrinsic feature of\nsymplectic 4-manifolds. So in the following sections we will occasionally\nconsider the more conventional problem of understanding isotopy classes\nof curves presenting only positive nodes and cusps, although most of the\ndiscussion applies equally well to curves with negative nodes.\nAssuming that the topology of the branch curve is understood (we will\ndiscuss how to achieve this in the next section), one still needs to consider\nthe branched covering f itself. The structure of f is determined by its\nmonodromy morphism \u03b8 : \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) \u2192 SN , where N is the degree of the\ncovering f . Fixing a base point p0 \u2208 CP2 \u2212 D, the image by \u03b8 of a loop\n\u03b3 in the complement of D is the permutation of the fiber f \u22121 (p0 ) induced\nby the monodromy of f along \u03b3. (Since viewing this permutation as an\nelement of SN depends on the choice of an identification between f \u22121 (p0 )\nand {1, . . . , N }, the morphism \u03b8 is only well-defined up to conjugation by\nan element of SN .) By Proposition 3, the isotopy class of the branch curve\nD and the monodromy morphism \u03b8 determine completely the symplectic\n4-manifold (X, \u03c9) up to symplectomorphism.\nConsider a loop \u03b3 which bounds a small topological disc intersecting D\ntransversely once: such a loop plays a role similar to the meridian of a\nknot, and is called a geometric generator of \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D). Then \u03b8(\u03b3) is a\n\n\f6\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\ntransposition (because of the local model near a simple branch point). Since\nthe image of \u03b8 is generated by transpositions and acts transitively on the\nfiber (assuming X to be connected), \u03b8 is a surjective group homomorphism.\nMoreover, the smoothness of X above the singular points of D imposes\ncertain compatibility conditions on \u03b8. Therefore, not every singular plane\ncurve can be the branch curve of a smooth covering; moreover, the morphism\n\u03b8, if it exists, is often unique (up to conjugation in SN ). In the case of\nalgebraic curves, this uniqueness property, which holds except for a finite\nlist of well-known counterexamples, is known as Chisini's conjecture, and\nwas essentially proved by Kulikov a few years ago [18].\nThe upshot of the above discussion is that, in order to understand symplectic 4-manifolds, it is in principle enough to understand singular plane\ncurves. Moreover, if the branch curve of a symplectic covering f : X \u2192 CP2\nhappens to be a complex curve, then the integrable complex structure of\nCP2 can be lifted to an integrable complex structure on X, compatible with\nthe symplectic structure; this implies that X is a complex projective surface.\nSo, considering the branched coverings constructed in Theorem 4, we have:\nCorollary 5. For k \u226b 0 the branch curve Dk \u2282 CP2 is isotopic to a complex\ncurve (up to node cancellations) if and only if X is a complex projective\nsurface.\nThis motivates the study of the symplectic isotopy problem, which we will\ndiscuss in \u00a76. For now we focus on the use of braid monodromy invariants to\nstudy the topology of singular plane curves. In the present context, the goal\nof this approach is to reduce the classification of symplectic 4-manifolds to a\npurely algebraic problem, in a manner vaguely reminiscent of the role played\nby Kirby calculus in the classification of smooth 4-manifolds; as we shall\nsee below, representing symplectic 4-manifolds as branched covers of CP2\nnaturally leads one to study the calculus of factorizations in braid groups.\n4. The topology of singular plane curves\nThe topology of singular algebraic plane curves has been studied extensively since Zariski. One of the main tools is the notion of braid monodromy\nof a plane curve, which has been used in particular by Moishezon and Teicher in many papers since the early 1980s in order to study branch curves\nof generic projections of complex projective surfaces (see [34] for a detailed\noverview). Braid monodromy techniques can be applied to the more general case of Hurwitz curves in ruled surfaces, i.e. curves which behave in a\ngeneric manner with respect to the ruling. In the case of CP2 , we consider\nthe projection \u03c0 : CP2 \u2212 {(0 : 0 : 1)} \u2192 CP1 given by (x : y : z) 7\u2192 (x : y).\nDefinition 6. A curve D \u2282 CP2 (not passing through (0 : 0 : 1)) is a Hurwitz\ncurve (or braided curve) if D is positively transverse to the fibers of \u03c0 everywhere except at finitely many points where D is smooth and non-degenerately\ntangent to the fibers.\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\nCP2 \u2212 {0 : 0 : 1}\nq\n\n7\n\nD\n\nq\nq\n\n\u03c0 : (x : y : z) 7\u2192 (x : y)\n\nCP1\n\n\u2744\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nFigure 1. A Hurwitz curve in CP2\nThe projection \u03c0 makes D a singular branched cover of CP1 , of degree\nd = deg D = [D] * [CP1 ]. Each fiber of \u03c0 is a complex line l \u2243 C \u2282 CP2 ,\nand if l does not pass through any of the singular points of D nor any of\nits vertical tangencies, then l \u2229 D consists of d distinct points. We can\ntrivialize the fibration \u03c0 over an affine subset C \u2282 CP1 , and define the braid\nmonodromy morphism\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 (C \u2212 crit(\u03c0|D )) \u2192 Bd .\nHere Bd is the Artin braid group on d strings (the fundamental group of the\nconfiguration space Conf d (C) of d distinct points in C), and for any loop \u03b3\nthe braid \u03c1(\u03b3) describes the motion of the d points of l \u2229 D inside the fibers\nof \u03c0 as one moves along the loop \u03b3.\nEquivalently, choosing an ordered system of arcs generating the free group\n\u03c01 (C \u2212 crit(\u03c0|D )), one can express the braid monodromy of D by a factorization\nY\n\u03c1i\n\u22062 =\ni\n\nof the central element \u22062 (representing a full rotation by 2\u03c0) in Bd , where\neach factor \u03c1i is the monodromy around one of the special points (cusps,\nnodes, tangencies) of D.\nA same Hurwitz curve can be described by different factorizations of \u22062 in\nBd : switching to a different ordered system of generators of \u03c01 (C\u2212crit(\u03c0|D ))\naffects the collection of factors h\u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1r i by a sequence of Hurwitz moves,\ni.e. operations of the form\nh\u03c11 , * * * , \u03c1i , \u03c1i+1 , * * * , \u03c1r i \u2190\u2192 h\u03c11 , * * * , (\u03c1i \u03c1i+1 \u03c1\u22121\ni ), \u03c1i , * * * , \u03c1r i;\nand changing the identification between the reference fiber (l, l\u2229D) of \u03c0 and\nthe base point in Conf d (C) affects braid monodromy by a global conjugation\nh\u03c11 , * * * , \u03c1r i \u2190\u2192 hb\u22121 \u03c11 b, * * * , b\u22121 \u03c1r bi.\nFor Hurwitz curves whose only singularities are cusps and nodes (of either\norientation), or more generally curves with An (and An ) singularities, the\nbraid monodromy factorization determines the isotopy type completely (see\nfor example [17]). Hence, determining whether two given Hurwitz curves\n\n\f8\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\nare isotopic among Hurwitz curves is equivalent to determining whether\ntwo given factorizations of \u22062 coincide up to Hurwitz moves and global\nconjugation.\nIt is easy to see that any Hurwitz curve in CP2 can be made symplectic\nby an isotopy through Hurwitz curves: namely, the image of any Hurwitz\ncurve by the rescaling map (x : y : z) 7\u2192 (x : y : \u03bbz) is a Hurwitz curve,\nand symplectic for |\u03bb| \u226a 1. On the other hand, a refinement of Theorem\n4 makes it possible to assume without loss of generality that the branch\ncurves Dk \u2282 CP2 are Hurwitz curves [7]. So, from now on we can specifically\nconsider symplectic coverings with Hurwitz branch curves. In this setting,\nbraid monodromy gives a purely combinatorial description of the topology\nof compact (integral) symplectic 4-manifolds.\nThe braid monodromy of the branch curves Dk given by Theorem 4 can\nbe computed explicitly for various families of complex projective surfaces\n(non-K\u00e4hler examples are currently beyond reach). In fact, in the complex\ncase the branched coverings fk are isotopic to generic projections of projective embeddings. Accordingly, most of these computations rely purely on\nmethods from algebraic geometry, using the degeneration techniques extensively developed by Moishezon and Teicher (see [1, 21, 22, 24, 26, 34, 35] and\nreferences within); but approximately holomorphic methods can be used to\nsimplify the calculations and bring a whole new range of examples within\nreach [6]. This includes some complex surfaces of general type which are\nmutually homeomorphic and have identical Seiberg-Witten invariants but\nof which it is unknown whether they are symplectomorphic or even diffeomorphic (the Horikawa surfaces).\nHowever, the main obstacle standing in the way of this approach to the\ntopology of symplectic 4-manifolds is the intractability of the so-called \"Hurwitz problem\" for braid monodromy factorizations: namely, there is no algorithm to decide whether two given braid monodromy factorizations are\nidentical up to Hurwitz moves. Therefore, since we are unable to compare\nbraid monodromy factorizations, we have to extract the information contained in them by indirect means, via the introduction of more manageable\n(but less powerful) invariants.\n5. Fundamental groups of branch curve complements\nThe idea of studying algebraic plane curves by determining the fundamental groups of their complements is a very classical one, which goes back\nto Zariski and Van Kampen. More recently, Moishezon and Teicher have\nshown that fundamental groups of branch curve complements can be used\nas a major tool to further our understanding of complex projective surfaces\n(cf. e.g. [21, 25, 34]). By analogy with the situation for knots in S 3 , one expects the topology of the complement to carry a lot of information about the\ncurve; however in this case the fundamental group does not determine the\nisotopy type. For an algebraic curve in CP2 , or more generally for a Hurwitz\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\n9\n\ncurve, the fundamental group of the complement is determined in an explicit\nmanner by the braid monodromy factorization, via the Zariski-Van Kampen\ntheorem. Hence, calculations of fundamental groups of complements usually\nrely on braid monodromy techniques.\nA close examination of the available data suggests that, contrarily to\nwhat has often been claimed, in the specific case of generic projections of\ncomplex surfaces projectively embedded by sections of a sufficiently ample\nlinear system (i.e. taking k \u226b 0 in Theorem 4), the fundamental group of\nthe branch curve complement may be determined in an elementary manner\nby the topology of the surface (see below).\nIn the symplectic setting, the fundamental group of the complement of\nthe branch curve D of a covering f : X \u2192 CP2 is affected by node creation\nor cancellation operations. Indeed, adding pairs of nodes (in a manner compatible with the monodromy morphism \u03b8 : \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) \u2192 SN ) introduces\nadditional commutation relations between geometric generators of the fundamental group. Hence, it is necessary to consider a suitable \"symplectic\nstabilization\" of \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) [6]:\nDefinition 7. Let K be the normal subgroup of \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) generated by\nthe commutators [\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ] for all pairs \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 of geometric generators such that\n\u03b8(\u03b3) and \u03b8(\u03b3 \u2032 ) are disjoint commuting transpositions. Then the symplectic\nstabilization of \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) is the quotient \u1e20 = \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D)/K.\nConsidering the branch curves Dk of the coverings given by Theorem 4,\nwe have the following result [6]:\nTheorem 8 (A.-Donaldson-Katzarkov-Yotov). For k \u226b 0, the stabilized\ngroup \u1e20k (X, \u03c9) = \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 Dk )/Kk is an invariant of the symplectic manifold (X 4 , \u03c9).\nThe fundamental group of the complement of a plane branch curve D \u2282\nCP2 comes naturally equipped with two morphisms: the symmetric group\nvalued monodromy homomorphism \u03b8 discussed above, and the abelianization map \u03b4 : \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212D) \u2192 H1 (CP2 \u2212D, Z). Since we only consider irreducible branch curves, we have H1 (CP2 \u2212D, Z) \u2243 Zd , where d = deg D, and\n\u03b4 counts the linking number (mod d) with the curve D. The morphisms \u03b8\nand \u03b4 are surjective, but the image of (\u03b8, \u03b4) : \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D) \u2192 SN \u00d7 Zd is the\nindex 2 subgroup consisting of all pairs (\u03c3, p) such that the permutation \u03c3\nand the integer p have the same parity (note that d is always even). The\nsubgroup K introduced in Definition 7 lies in the kernel of (\u03b8, \u03b4); therefore,\nsetting G0 = Ker(\u03b8, \u03b4)/K, we have an exact sequence\n(\u03b8,\u03b4)\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 G0 \u2212\u2192 \u1e20 \u2212\u2192 SN \u00d7 Zd \u2212\u2192 Z2 \u2212\u2192 1.\nMoreover, assume that the symplectic 4-manifold X is simply connected,\nand denote by L = f \u2217 [CP1 ] the pullback of the hyperplane class and by\nKX = \u2212c1 (T X) the canonical class. Then we have the following result [6]:\n\n\f10\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\nTheorem 9 (A.-Donaldson-Katzarkov-Yotov). If \u03c01 (X) = 1 then there is\na natural surjective homomorphism \u03c6 : Ab(G0 ) \u0589 (Z2 /\u039b)N \u22121 , where \u039b =\n{(L * C, KX * C), C \u2208 H2 (X, Z)} \u2282 Z2 .\nThe fundamental groups of the branch curve complements have been computed for generic polynomial maps to CP2 on various algebraic surfaces,\nusing braid monodromy techniques (cf. \u00a74) and the Zariski-Van Kampen\ntheorem. Since in the symplectic setting Theorem 4 gives uniqueness up to\nisotopy only for k \u226b 0, we restrict ourselves to those examples for which the\nfundamental groups have been computed for CP2 -valued maps of arbitrarily\nlarge degree.\nThe first such calculations were carried out by Moishezon and Teicher, for\nCP2 , CP1 \u00d7 CP1 [22], and Hirzebruch surfaces ([24], see also [6]); the answer\nis also known for some specific linear systems on rational surfaces and K3\nsurfaces realized as complete intersections (by work of Robb [26], see also\nrelated papers by Teicher et al). Additionally, the symplectic stabilizations\nof the fundamental groups have been computed for all double covers of\nCP1 \u00d7 CP1 branched along connected smooth algebraic curves [6], which\nincludes an infinite family of surfaces of general type.\nIn all these examples it turns out that, if one considers projections of\nsufficiently large degree (i.e., assuming k \u2265 3 for CP2 and k \u2265 2 for the\nother examples), the structure of G0 is very simple, and obeys the following\nconjecture:\nConjecture 10. Assume that X is a simply connected algebraic surface and\nk \u226b 0. Then: (1) the symplectic stabilization operation is trivial, i.e. K =\n{1} and \u1e20 = \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212D); (2) the homomorphism \u03c6 : Ab(G0 ) \u2192 (Z2 /\u039b)N \u22121\nis an isomorphism; and (3) the commutator subgroup [G0 , G0 ] is a quotient\nof Z2 \u00d7 Z2 .\n6. The symplectic isotopy problem\nThe symplectic isotopy problem asks under which conditions (assumptions on degree, genus, types and numbers of singular points) it is true that\nany symplectic curve in CP2 (or more generally in a complex surface) is symplectically isotopic to a complex curve (by isotopy, we mean a continuous\nfamily of symplectic curves with the same singularities).\nThe first result in this direction is due to Gromov, who proved that every\nsmooth symplectic curve of degree 1 or 2 in CP2 is isotopic to a complex curve\n[15]. The argument relies on a careful study of the deformation problem\nfor pseudo-holomorphic curves: starting from an almost-complex structure\nJ for which the given curve C is pseudo-holomorphic, and considering a\nfamily of almost-complex structures (Jt )t\u2208[0,1] interpolating between J and\nthe standard complex structure, one can prove the existence of smooth Jt holomorphic curves Ct realizing an isotopy between C and a complex curve.\nThe isotopy property is expected to hold for smooth and nodal curves\nin all degrees, and also for curves with sufficiently few cusps. For smooth\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\n11\n\ncurves, successive improvements of Gromov's result have been obtained by\nSikorav (for degree 3), Shevchishin (for degree \u2264 6), and more recently\nSiebert and Tian [28]:\nTheorem 11 (Siebert-Tian). Every smooth symplectic curve of degree \u2264 17\nin CP2 is symplectically isotopic to a complex curve.\nSome results have been obtained by Barraud and Shevchishin for nodal\ncurves of low genus. For example, the following result holds [27]:\nTheorem 12 (Shevchishin). Every irreducible nodal symplectic curve of\ngenus g \u2264 4 in CP2 is symplectically isotopic to a complex curve.\nMoreover, work in progress by S. Francisco is expected to lead to an\nisotopy result for curves of low degree with node and cusp singularities\n(subject to specific constraints on the number of cusps).\nIf one aims to classify symplectic 4-manifolds by enumerating all branched\ncovers of CP2 according to the degree and number of singularities of the\nbranch curve, then the above cases are those for which the classification is\nthe simplest and does not include any non-K\u00e4hler examples. On the other\nhand, Corollary 5 implies that the isotopy property cannot hold for all curves\nwith node and cusp singularities; in fact, explicit counterexamples have been\nconstructed by Moishezon [23] (see below).\nEven when the isotopy property fails, the classification of singular plane\ncurves becomes much simpler if one considers an equivalence relation weaker\nthan isotopy, such as regular homotopy, or stable isotopy. Namely, let D1 , D2\nbe two Hurwitz curves (see Definition 6) in CP2 (or more generally in a rational ruled surface), with node and cusp singularities (or more generally\nsingularities of type An ). Assume that D1 and D2 represent the same homology class, and that they have the same numbers of singular points of\neach type. Then we have the following results [8, 17]:\nTheorem 13 (A.-Kulikov-Shevchishin). Under the above assumptions, D1\nand D2 are regular homotopic among Hurwitz curves, i.e. they are isotopic\nup to creations and cancellations of pairs of nodes.\nTheorem 14 (Kharlamov-Kulikov). Under the above assumptions, let Di\u2032\n(i \u2208 {1, 2}) be the curve obtained by adding to Di a union of n generic\nlines (or fibers of the ruling) intersecting Di transversely at smooth points,\nand smoothing out all the resulting intersections. Then for all large enough\nvalues of n the Hurwitz curves D1\u2032 and D2\u2032 are isotopic.\nUnfortunately, Theorem 13 does not seem to have any implications for the\ntopology of symplectic 4-manifolds, because the node creation operations\nappearing in the regular homotopy need not be admissible: even if both\nD1 and D2 are branch curves of symplectic coverings, the homotopy may\ninvolve plane curves for which the branched cover is not smooth. For similar\nreasons, the applicability of Theorem 14 to branch curves is limited to the\n\n\f12\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\ncase of double covers, i.e. symplectic 4-manifolds which admit hyperelliptic\nLefschetz fibrations. In particular, for genus 2 Lefschetz fibrations we have\nthe following result [3]:\nTheorem 15. If the symplectic 4-manifold X admits a genus 2 Lefschetz\nfibration, then X becomes complex projective after stabilization by fiber sums\nwith rational surfaces along genus 2 curves.\nIt follows from Theorem 14 that this result extends to all Lefschetz fibrations with monodromy contained in the hyperelliptic mapping class group.\nHowever, few symplectic 4-manifolds admit such fibrations, and in general\nthe following question remains open:\nQuestion 16. Let X1 , X2 be two integral compact symplectic 4-manifolds\nwith the same (c21 , c2 , c1*[\u03c9], [\u03c9]2 ). Do X1 and X2 become symplectomorphic\nafter sufficiently many fiber sums with the same complex projective surfaces\n(chosen among a finite collection of model holomorphic fibrations)?\nThis question can be thought of as the symplectic analogue of the classical result of Wall which asserts that any two simply connected smooth\n4-manifolds with the same intersection form become diffeomorphic after repeatedly performing connected sums with S 2 \u00d7 S 2 [37].\nA closer look at the known examples of non-isotopic singular plane curves\nsuggests that an even stronger statement might hold.\nIt was first observed in 1999 by Fintushel and Stern [12] that many symplectic 4-manifolds contain infinite families of non-isotopic smooth connected\nsymplectic curves representing the same homology class (see also [29]). The\nsimplest examples are obtained by \"braiding\" parallel copies of the fiber in\nan elliptic surface, and are distinguished by comparing the Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants of the corresponding double branched covers. Other examples\nhave been constructed by Smith, Etg\u00fc and Park, and Vidussi. However, for\nsingular plane curves the first examples were obtained by Moishezon more\nthan ten years ago [23]:\nTheorem 17 (Moishezon). For all p \u2265 2, there exist infinitely many pairwise non-isotopic singular symplectic curves of degree 9p(p \u2212 1) in CP2 with\n2\n27(p \u2212 1)(4p \u2212 5) cusps and 27\n2 (p \u2212 1)(p \u2212 2)(3p + 3p \u2212 8) nodes, not isotopic\nto any complex curve.\nMoishezon's approach is purely algebraic (using braid monodromy factorizations), and very technical; the curves that he constructs are distinguished\nby the fundamental groups of their complements [23]. However a much simpler geometric description of this construction can be given in terms of\nbraiding operations, which makes it possible to distinguish the curves just\nby comparing the canonical classes of the associated branched covers [4].\nGiven a symplectic covering f : X \u2192 Y with branch curve D, and given\na Lagrangian annulus A with interior in Y \\ D and boundary contained in\nD, we can braid the curve D along the annulus A by performing the local\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS, PLANE CURVES, AND ISOTOPY\n\n13\n\nA\n\nD\n\nD\u0303\n\nFigure 2. The braiding construction\noperation depicted on Figure 2. Namely, we cut out a neighborhood U of\nA, and glue it back via a non-trivial diffeomorphism which interchanges two\nof the connected components of D \u2229 \u2202U , in such a way that the product of\nS 1 with the trivial braid is replaced by the product of S 1 with a half-twist\n(see [4] for details).\nBraiding the curve D along the Lagrangian annulus A affects the branched\ncover X by a Luttinger surgery along a smooth embedded Lagrangian torus\nT which is one of the connected components of f \u22121 (A) [4]. This operation\nconsists of cutting out from X a tubular neighborhood of T , foliated by parallel Lagrangian tori, and gluing it back via a symplectomorphism wrapping\nthe meridian around the torus (in the direction of the preimage of an arc\njoining the two boundaries of A), while the longitudes are not affected.\nThe starting point of Moishezon's construction is the complex curve D0\nobtained by considering 3p(p \u2212 1) smooth cubics in a pencil, removing balls\naround the 9 points where these cubics intersect, and inserting into each\nlocation the branch curve of a generic degree p polynomial map from CP2 to\nitself. By repeatedly braiding D0 along a well-chosen Lagrangian annulus,\none obtains symplectic curves Dj , j \u2208 Z. Moishezon's calculations show\nthat, whereas for the initial curve the fundamental group of the complement\n\u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 D0 ) is infinite, the groups \u03c01 (CP2 \u2212 Dj ) are finite for all j 6= 0,\nand of different orders [23]. On the other hand, it is fairly easy to check\nthat, as expected from Theorem 9, this change in fundamental groups can\nbe detected by considering the canonical class of the p2 -fold covering Xj of\nCP2 branched along Dj . Namely, the canonical class of X0 is proportional\nto the cohomology class of the symplectic form induced by the branched\ncovering: c1 (KX0 ) = \u03bb[\u03c9X0 ], where \u03bb = 6p\u22129\np . On the other hand, c1 (KXj ) =\n\u03bb[\u03c9Xj ] + \u03bc j [T ]P D , where \u03bc = 2p\u22123\n6= 0, and the homology class [T ] of the\np\nLagrangian torus T is not a torsion element in H2 (Xj , Z) [4].\nMany constructions of non-K\u00e4hler symplectic 4-manifolds can be thought\nof in terms of twisted fiber sum operations, or Fintushel-Stern surgery along\nfibered links. However the key component in each of these constructions can\nbe understood as a particular instance of Luttinger surgery; so it makes sense\nto ask to what extent Luttinger surgery may be responsible for the greater\n\n\f14\n\nDENIS AUROUX\n\nvariety of symplectic 4-manifolds compared to complex surfaces. More precisely, we may ask the following questions:\nQuestion 18. Let D1 , D2 be two symplectic curves with nodes and cusps in\nCP2 , of the same degree and with the same numbers of nodes and cusps. Is\nit always possible to obtain D2 from D1 by a sequence of braiding operations\nalong Lagrangian annuli?\nQuestion 19. Let X1 , X2 be two integral compact symplectic 4-manifolds\nwith the same (c21 , c2 , c1 *[\u03c9], [\u03c9]2 ). Is it always possible to obtain X2 from\nX1 by a sequence of Luttinger surgeries?\nThis question is the symplectic analogue of a question asked by Ron\nStern about smooth 4-manifolds, namely whether any two simply connected\nsmooth 4-manifolds with the same Euler characteristic and signature differ\nfrom each other by a sequence of logarithmic transformations. However,\nhere we do not require the manifolds to be simply connected, we do not\neven require them to have the same fundamental group.\nReferences\n[1] M. Amram, D. Goldberg, M. Teicher, U.
