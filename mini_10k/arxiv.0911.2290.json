In equation\n(1), u = u(x, y, t) is the wave amplitude, the subscripts denote partial derivatives with\nrespect to x, y, t, and \u03b2 = \u00b11. Throughout this article, equation (1) with \u03b2 = 1, which\ncorresponds to the negative-dispersion KP equation (KP II) will be considered, and will\nbe referred to as the KP equation.\nThe KP equation is a completely integrable system whose underlying mathematical\nproperties have been extensively studied during the last four decades. They are well documented in several monographs including (but not limited to) [3, 4, 5, 6]. These properties\ninclude the existence of multi-soliton and periodic solutions and the Lax representation of\nthe inverse scattering transform. A major breakthrough in the KP theory occurred in 1981\nwhen Sato [7] formulated the KP equation in terms of an infinite dimensional Grassmann\nmanifold known as the Sato universal Grassmannian. A finite dimensional version of the\nSato theory corresponding to the real Grassmannian Gr(N, M ) (the set of N -dimensional\nsubspaces of RM ) leads to a simple algebraic construction of a special class of solitary\nwave solutions of the KP equation called the line-soliton solutions. These are real, nonsingular solutions which decay exponentially in the xy -plane except along certain directions. Specifically, such a solution is localized along two distinct sets of rays (referred to\n\n1 Corresponding\n\nauthor.

Clearly, the soliton amplitude depends on the wave\nvector k, which together with the frequency \u03c9 satisfy the soliton dispersion relation\n4\u03c9kx = 4kx4 + 3ky2 .\n\nThe solitary wave-form given by (2) is localized in the xy -plane along a line which makes\nan angle \u03c8 measured counterclockwise from the y -axis where\ntan \u03c8 = ky /kx = k1 + k2 ,\n\n\u2212 \u03c02 < \u03c8 <\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n.\n\nA one-soliton solution is shown in Figure 1(a). Since the one-soliton solution is characterized by two real parameters k1 , k2 , it is convenient to denote this solution simply as the\n[1, 2]-soliton. Note that when k1 + k2 = 0, the solution in (2) becomes y -independent and\nreduces to the one-soliton solution of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.\nThe soliton interactions of the KP equation were originally described via a 2-soliton solution with a \"X\"-shape pattern in the plane formed by the intersection of two line solitons\nbut with a parallel shift of the two lines at the intersection (the phase shift). This 2-soliton\nsolution (see Figure 1(c)) referred to as the O-type soliton (\"O\" stands for original) and\nits N -soliton generalization were obtained independently by several authors using integral\nequations [8] and other algebraic methods [9, 25]. In 1977, Miles [11] pointed out that the\nO-type 2-soliton solution becomes singular if the angle of the intersection is smaller than a\ncertain critical value. As the angle approaches the critical value from above, the 2-soliton\nphase shift tends to infinity, and at the critical angle the O-type solution degenerates to\na \"Y-shape\" with only three line solitons interacting resonantly (see also [12]). It turns\nout that such Y-shape interacting wave-forms are also exact solutions of the KP equation [13, 14]. Apart from the ones mentioned thus far, no other soliton solutions of the\nKP equation were known for quite some time until recently when more general types of\nresonant and non-resonant line-soliton solutions were reported in several works including\n[15, 16, 17, 18]. During the last 5 years, considerable progress has been made toward the\nproblem of classifying all exact line-soliton solutions of the KP equation [19, 20, 21, 22].\nThese studies have revealed a large variety of soliton solutions which were totally overlooked in the past. Generically, these solutions of KP consist of two distinct sets of line\nsolitons of different amplitudes and along different directions in the xy -plane as y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\nLocally, each line soliton denoted as the [i, j]-soliton has the form of a one-soliton solution as in (2), parametrized by two distinct real parameters ki < kj , i < j . The soliton\namplitude is given by \u03b1ij = 21 (kj \u2212 ki )2 and the soliton angle \u03c8ij (counterclockwise from\nthe y -axis) satisfies tan \u03c8ij = ki + kj .\nThere are several direct and algebraic methods to construct the KP line-soliton solutions\nwhich are usually derived from either a Wronskian or from a Gram determinant (Grammian). In principle any given soliton solution can be represented in either form, although\nthis fact has been explicitly shown for only the one-soliton and the O-type soliton solutions. For more general line-soliton solutions, it is often more difficult to impose regularity\nconditions on the solution when it is represented in one particular form than the other, thus\nrendering one solution generating method less efficient than another.

In particular, we present a detailed discussion of two distinct types\nof two-soliton solutions both of which form an \"X\"-shape pattern on the xy -plane but\ninteract in a significantly different way.\nThe paper is planned as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the \u03c4 -function of the KP\nequation and present its Wronskian and Grammian forms generating the line-soliton solutions. Then the equivalence of these two representations of the \u03c4 -function is established.\nSection 3 is devoted to a brief description of the distinct types of the 2-soliton solutions,\nfollowed by a detailed discussion of the nonlinear interaction properties of the O-type\nand P-type 2-soliton solutions. We conclude the paper with a brief summary and possible\nsignificance of the results.\n\n2.\n\nThe KP \u03c4 -function\n\nThe most convenient representation for the line-soliton solutions is via the \u03c4 -function\nwhich plays an important role in the mathematical theory of the KP equation [6, 7]. The\nsolution u(x, y, t) of (1) can be expressed as\nu(x, y, t) = 2(ln \u03c4 )xx ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c4 (x, y, t) is the KP \u03c4 -function which is defined up to an exponential factor that is\nlinear in x, y and t.\n\n2.1.

This implies that any linearly independent set of solutions of the\nlinear system (5) will give rise to a solution of the KP equation. Hence it is possible to\ngenerate a large class of solutions in this way. In particular, the line-soliton solutions are\nobtained from the choice\nfn (x, y, t) =\n\nM\nX\n\nanm e\u03b8m ,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n\n(6)\n\nm=1\n2 y + k3 t + \u03b8\nwhere \u03b8m (x, y, t) = km x + km\n0m with distinct real parameters: k1 < k2 <\nm\nM\n. . . < kM and real constants {\u03b80m }m=1 . The coefficients (anm ) =: A define an N \u00d7\nM constant matrix which is of rank N due to the linear independence of the functions\n{fn }N\nn=1 . Then (4) can be expressed as\n\n\u03c4 (x, y, t) =\n\nX\n\nA(m1 , . . . , mN ) exp[ \u03b8(m1 , . . . , mN ) ]\n\n1\u2264m1 <***<mN \u2264M\n\nY\n\n1\u2264s<r\u2264N\n\n(kmr \u2212 kms ) , (7)\n\nby expanding the Wronskian determinant using Binet-Cauchy formula. In above,\n\u03b8(m1 , . . . , mN ) := \u03b8m1 + \u03b8m2 + . . . + \u03b8mN , and A(m1 , . . . , mN ) is the maximal\nminor, i.e., the determinant of the N \u00d7 N sub-matrix of A obtained from columns\n1 \u2264 m1 < * * * < mN \u2264 M . Note that the N linearly independent rows of the coefficient matrix A span an N -dimensional subspace W of RM so that A can be regarded as\na point of the real Grassmannian Gr(N, M ). A different choice of basis for W amounts\nto performing row operations: A \u2192 GA, G \u2208 GL(N, R), which changes the \u03c4 -function\nin (7) simply by a scale factor: \u03c4 \u2192 det(G)\u03c4 but leaves the KP solution u = 2(ln \u03c4 )xx\ninvariant. Consequently the coefficient matrix A can be canonically chosen in the reduced row echelon form (RREF) which has a distinguished set of pivot columns such\nthat the restriction of A to this set corresponds to the N \u00d7 N identity matrix. Given any\nN \u00d7 M matrix A of rank N , its unique RREF gives a standard coordinate for the corresponding point in Gr(N, M ). It is in this sense that the space of all solutions of KP\ngenerated by the \u03c4 -function given by (7) can be identified with the real Grassmann manifold Gr(N, M ). In general, such solutions are not all line-solitons as they can be singular\nwhere the \u03c4 -function becomes zero. The regularity of the solutions in the entire xy -plane\nand for all values of t is achieved by imposing a further restriction on the coefficient matrix A, namely that all of its N \u00d7 N maximal minors be non-negative. Such matrices are\ncalled totally non-negative matrices, they represent the totally non-negative Grassmannian\nGr+ (N, M ) which forms a closed subset in Gr(N, M ), and which identifies the space of\nall line-soliton solutions of the KP equation.\nSome simple examples of \u03c4 -functions corresponding to some of the solutions mentioned in Section 1 are listed below.\nOne-soliton solution: In this case, one chooses a single function in (6) of the form\nf1 = e\u03b81 + e\u03b82 . The coefficient matrix is simply A = (1 1), and \u03c4 = f1 . Then equation\n(3) yields the one-soliton solution given by (2) in Section 1 with \u03b80 = \u03b802 \u2212 \u03b801 . Note\nthat since k1 < k2 , \u03c4 \u223c e\u03b81 \u226b e\u03b82 and u(x, y, t) \u223c 0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. A similar argument\nshows that u is also exponentially small as x \u2192 \u221e. In this case, one finds from the exact\nexpression in (2) that the solution is localized in the xy -plane along the line \u03b81 = \u03b82 (for\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n5\n\nfixed t) where the two exponentials in the \u03c4 -function are precisely in balance (see Figure\n1(a)). It turns out that even for general line-solitons, the solution u(x, y, t) is localized\nalong certain lines in the xy -plane where exactly two exponential terms in the \u03c4 -function\nof equation (7) are in balance, and they dominate over all other exponential terms. This\nprinciple of dominant balance was implemented in Refs [17, 19, 20, 21] to identify the\nasymptotic line solitons [i, j] associated with each line-soliton solution of the KP equation.\nMiles Y-shape solution: The \u03c4 -function for this solution is a sum of three exponential\nfunctions, i.e., \u03c4 = f1 = e\u03b81 + e\u03b82 + e\u03b83 with the coefficient matrix A = (1 1 1).\nApplying the dominant balance principle mentioned above, it is possible here to determine\nthe dominant exponentials and analyze the structure of the solution in the xy -plane. One\nfinds that the solution u(x, y, t) is localized along three lines corresponding to the line\nsoliton [1, 3] for y \u226b 1, and line solitons [1, 2], [2, 3] for y \u226a 1 as illustrated in Figure\n1(b). For i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, each line soliton [i, j], i < j is locally of the form of the\none-soliton solution (2) with distinct parameters ki , kj . As mentioned in Section 1, the\nMiles solution represents a resonant solution of three line solitons. The resonant condition\namong those three line-solitons is given by\nk13 = k12 + k23 ,\n\n\u03c913 = \u03c912 + \u03c923 ,\n\nwhere kij = 12 (kj \u2212 ki , kj2 \u2212 ki2 ) and \u03c9ij = 12 (kj3 \u2212 ki3 ) are respectively, the wave vector\nand frequency of the line soliton [i, j], satisfying the soliton dispersion relation given in\nSection 1.\nO-type 2-soliton solution: Here the \u03c4 -function is a Wronskian of two linearly independent solutions of (5). These solutions are obtained from (6) by choosing N = 2, M = 4,\nand the coefficient matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1100\nA=\n,\n0011\n\nsuch that f1 = e\u03b81 + e\u03b82 and f2 = e\u03b83 + e\u03b84 . Note that A is a totally non-negative matrix\nwhose 2 \u00d7 2 maximal minors are: A(1, 2) = A(3, 4) = 0, and A(1, 3) = A(1, 4) =\nA(2, 3) = A(2, 4) = 1. From (7), the resulting \u03c4 -function is given by\n\u03c4 = (k3 \u2212k1 )e\u03b8(1,3) +(k4 \u2212k1 )e\u03b8(1,4) +(k3 \u2212k2 )e\u03b8(2,3) +(k4 \u2212k2 )e\u03b8(2,4) ,\n\n\u03b8(i, j) := \u03b8i +\u03b8j .\n\nFigure 1(c) illustrates the regions in the xy -plane where each of the four exponential terms\nin the above \u03c4 -function are dominant. The line solitons corresponding to the solution\nu = 2(ln \u03c4 )xx are [1, 2] and [3, 4] for |y| \u2192 \u221e; these are localized along the directions\nwhere a pair of dominant exponential terms are in balance.\n\n2.2. The Grammian form of the \u03c4 -function\n\nThe Grammian construction of the line-soliton solutions will be described next. This form\nof the solution arises from the so called binary Darboux transformation of the KP equation\n(see e.g., [24]). In this case, the \u03c4 -function can be expressed as a a determinant of an N \u00d7N\nmatrix as follows:\n\u03c4 = det(\u03a9) ,\n\n\u03a9ij =\n\nZ\n\n\u0393\n\nfi gj dx\u2212(fi gjx \u2212 fix gj ) dy ,\n\ni, j = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n\n(8)\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n6\nN\nwhere {fi }N\ni=1 solve (5) and {gj }j=1 solve the (formal) adjoint system of (5), namely,\n\n\u2212gy = gxx ,\n\ngt = gxxx .\n\nIt is easily verified from (5) and its adjoint that d\u03a9ij is an exact differential, hence the line\nintegral above can be evaluated along any suitable curve \u0393 in the xy -plane such that the\nintegral converges. Like the Wronskian form, it can be shown that the \u03c4 -function in (8)\nyields a solution of the KP equation via (3) for any choice of the sets of functions {fi }N\ni=1\nand {gj }N\nj=1 [6]. For the line-soliton solutions, these are chosen as linear combinations of\nexponentials (cf. (6)),\nfi =\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03c6(pn )\n\nbin e\n\n,\n\ngj =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nbbjn e\u2212\u03c6(qn ) ,\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , N ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c6(k) := kx + k2 y + k3 t + \u03c60 (k), and all the parameters p1 , . . . , pr , q1 , . . . , qN\nare distinct and real. Note that N 6= r , in general. Thus, B := (bmn ) is an N \u00d7 r matrix\nb := b\nwhereas B\nbmn is an invertible, N \u00d7 N matrix. Substituting (9) into the matrix elements \u03a9ij in (8), and evaluating the line integral along a path \u0393 from (\u2212\u03c3\u221e, y) to (x, y)\nparallel to the x-axis, yields\n\u03a9ij (x, y, t) = cij +\n\nZ\n\nfi gj dx = cij +\n\u0393\n\nr X\nN\nX\n\nm=1 n=1\n\n\u03c6(pm )\u2212\u03c6(qn )\n\ne\nbimbbjn\n\npm \u2212 q n\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = sgn(pm \u2212 qn ) = \u00b11 and cij are arbitrary constants. Choosing the constants\ncij = \u03b4ij , where \u03b4ij is the Kr\u00f6necker symbol (\u03b4ij = 0, i 6= j, \u03b4ii = 1), ensures that the\nmatrix \u03a9 is of rank N so that \u03c4 6= 0. Using (10), the \u03c4 -function in (8) can be expressed in\nthe form\nb T ) = det(I + CF ) ,\n\u03c4 = det(I + BF B\n\n(11)\n\nb T B is an N \u00d7 r matrix of constant coefficients and F is an r \u00d7 N matrix\nwhere C = B\nwhose entries are given by\nFmn =\n\ne\u03c6(pm )\u2212\u03c6(qn )\n,\npm \u2212 q n\n\nm = 1, 2, . . . , r,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . , N .\n\nThe Grammian form given by the first equality in (11) is not unique as it is possible to\nb . In particular,\nobtain the same \u03c4 -function from a different choice of the matrices B and B\nb\nB need not be a square matrix although there is always a canonical choice of an N \u00d7 N\nb that leads to the second equality in (11). We will not discuss the details of the\nmatrix B\nb in this article.\ngauge freedom underlying the choice of B and B\n\nEquation (11) is the canonical Grammian form for the line-soliton solutions, special\ncases of which arise from several direct methods of constructing solutions including the\nHirota method [6], direct linearization [4] and dressing techniques [8]. For example, the\nO-type N -soliton solution is obtained by setting r = N and C = I , the latter being the\nN \u00d7 N identity matrix. In this case the resulting \u03c4 -function \u03c4 = det(I + F ) is positive for\nall x, y, t if the parameters are ordered as pN < pN \u22121 < . . . < p1 < q1 < q2 < . . . < qN .\nThen the corresponding line-soliton solution is non-singular. More general line-soliton\nsolutions can also be generated from the Grammian form (11) by making appropriate\nchoices for the matrix C . However, in comparison with the Wronskian form, here it is\nless clear how to impose regularity conditions on the obtained solution. Recall that in\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n7\n\nthe Wronskian construction the ordering k1 < k2 < . . . < kM of the parameters and\nthe totally non-negative coefficient matrix A guarantee that the KP line-soliton solutions\nare regular. But no such clear prescription to obtain regular solutions is known for the\nGrammian case. This issue can be resolved by establishing an equivalence between the\nWronskian and the Grammian forms for the KP \u03c4 -function. This will be done below.\nMore specifically, it will be shown by explicit construction that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the formulas (7) and (11).\n\n2.3. Equivalence of the Wronskian and Grammian forms of the \u03c4 -function\n\nIt is convenient to first start with the Wronskian form and derive the \u03c4 -function formula\n(11) from that. It follows from either (7) or (4) that the \u03c4 -function can be written as:\n\u03c4 = det(AEK), where E = diag(e\u03b81 , e\u03b82 , . . . , e\u03b8M ) is an M \u00d7 M diagonal matrix\nand K := (Kij ) = (kij\u22121 ) is an M \u00d7 N Vandermonde matrix. In the following, the\nN \u00d7 M coefficient matrix A will be chosen in RREF such that it can be represented as\nA = (I , J)P with I and J denoting respectively, the N \u00d7 N and N \u00d7 (M \u2212 N ) submatrices of the pivot and non-pivot columns of A, and P being the M \u00d7 M permutation\nmatrix which shuffles those columns to form A. For example, the coefficient matrix for\nthe O-type 2-soliton \u03c4 -function discussed above can be represented as\nA=\n\n\u0012\n\n1100\n0011\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1010\nP23 ,\n0101\n\nwhere P23 is the 4 \u00d7 4 matrix permuting the second and the third columns. Using the\nabove form of A, the determinant for the \u03c4 -function becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nE1 0\nK1\n\u22121\n\u03c4 = |AEK| = |(I, J)(P EP )P K| = (I, J)\n= |IE1 K1 +JE2 K2 | ,\n0 E2\nK2\nwhere E1 and E2 are respectively, N \u00d7 N and (M \u2212 N ) \u00d7 (M \u2212 N ) block diagonal\nmatrices whose elements are permutations of the set {e\u03b81 , e\u03b82 , . . . , e\u03b8M }. Similarly, K1\nand K2 are respectively, N \u00d7 N and (M \u2212 N ) \u00d7 N matrices obtained by permuting the\nrows of the Vandermonde matrix K by P . It should be clear from above that in effect, the\nM \u00d7 M matrix P induces a permutation \u03c0 of the ordered set {k1 , k2 , . . . , kM } which can\nbe expressed as\n\u03c0({k1 , k2 , . . . , kM }) = {q1 , q2 , . . . , qN , p1 , p2 , . . . , pM \u2212N } ,\n\n(12)\n\nafter renaming the elements of the permuted set. Accordingly, the matrices\nE1 , E2 , K1 , K2 are redefined as\nE1 = diag(e\u03c6(q1 ) , e\u03c6(q2 ) , . . . , e\u03c6(qN ) ) ,\nj\u22121\nK1 := (K1ij )N\n),\ni,j=1 = (qi\n\nE2 = diag(e\u03c6(p1 ) , e\u03c6(p2 ) , . . . , e\u03c6(pM \u2212N ) ) ,\nK2 := (K2ij ) = (pij\u22121 ) ,\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , M \u2212 N, j = 1, . . . , N , and where \u03c6(k) is defined below (9). Since the\nparameters q1 , . . . , qN are distinct, the Vandermonde matrix K1 is invertible. Then the\nabove determinant expression for \u03c4 can be further manipulated as\n\u03c4 = |E1 K1 |b\n\u03c4,\n\n\u03c4b = |I + JE2 K2 K1\u22121 E1\u22121 | ,\n\nwhere \u03c4 and \u03c4b differ by an exponential factor linear in x, y, t, hence both generate the\nsame KP solution via (3). To show that \u03c4b is indeed the Grammian form of the \u03c4 -function,\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n8\n\none employs the following matrix identity which is derived in the Appendix,\nK2 K1\u22121 = D2 \u03c7D1\u22121 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the matrices D1 , D2 and the Cauchy matrix \u03c7 are defined as follows:\nD1 = diag\n\nN\n\u0010 Y\n\n\u0011N\n(qi \u2212 qj )\n,\n\nj=1,j6=i\n\n\u03c7 = (\u03c7)ij =\n\n1\n,\npi \u2212 q j\n\ni=1\n\nD2 = diag\n\nN\n\u0010Y\n\n\u0011M \u2212N\n(pi \u2212 qj )\n,\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\ni = 1, . . . , M \u2212 N, j = 1 . . . , N .\n\nSubstitution of (13) into the expression for \u03c4b above, yields\n\n\u03c4b = |I + JD2 E2 \u03c7E1\u22121 D1\u22121 | = |I + (D1\u22121 JD2 )(E2 \u03c7E1\u22121 )| .\n\nFinally, by setting r = M \u2212 N and the N \u00d7 M \u2212 N matrix C = D1\u22121 JD2 , the Grammian\nform of the \u03c4 -function in (11) is readily recovered from the expression of \u03c4b above.\n\nIt is relatively straightforward to reverse the steps described above to obtain the Wronskian data, i.e., the coefficient matrix A and the ordered set of parameters k1 < k2 <\n. . . < kM from the Grammian data, which consists of the N \u00d7 M \u2212 N matrix C and\nthe unordered set of parameters {q1 , . . . qN , p1 , . . . pM \u2212N }. The key step is to recover the\npermutation \u03c0 in (12) by simply ordering the set of Grammian parameters, i.e.,\n\u03c0 \u22121 ({q1 , . . . qN , p1 , . . . pM \u2212N }) = {k1 , k2 , . . . , kM } .\n\nThis in turn, provides the M \u00d7 M permutation matrix P from \u03c0 , and the matrix A is\nthen constructed by the formula A = (I , J)P with J = D1 CD2\u22121, thus establishing the\nGrammian-Wronskian equivalence for the \u03c4 -function for the KP line-soliton solutions.\nSuch equivalence was also derived in Ref. [25] for special N -soliton solutions using similar techniques.\nAn alternative approach to obtain the Wronskian form from the Grammian in (8) that\nis applicable when at least one of the functions fi or gj is an exponential, was discussed\nin [26]. In this case, one can for instance, choose the functions {fi }N\ni=1 as N linearly\n2\n\u2212\u03b8\nj N\nindependent solutions of (5), and {gj := e }j=1 with \u03b8j = kj x + kj y + kj3 t and kj > 0.\nUsing these forms of fi and gj in (8), and choosing \u0393 to be the path from (\u2212\u221e, y) to (x, y)\nparallel to the x-axis, the integral for the matrix element \u03a9ij can be expressed as an infinite\nseries in inverse powers of the parameters kj by repeated integration by parts, provided\n(n)\nthat fi gj \u2192 0, n \u2265 0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Then by taking the limit kj \u2192 \u221e, j = 1, . . . , N ,\none can recover the Wronskian form (4) from the determinant det(\u03a9).\nAn immediate consequence of the above equivalence result is that it is now possible\nto formulate the regularity condition for the KP line-solitons in a precise fashion from\nthe Grammian form (11) of the \u03c4 -function. Given the matrices C and P , a necessary\nand sufficient condition that the KP solution (3) is non-singular is given by the fact that\nA = (I, J)P be a totally non-negative matrix. Of course, this is the same condition on\nthe coefficient matrix A in the Wronskian form. If in addition, A satisfies the following\nirreducibility conditions:\n(i) each column of A contains at least one nonzero element,\n(ii) each row of A in RREF contains at least one nonzero element other than the pivot\n(first non-zero entry),\nthen the number of line solitons as y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e in the solution generated by the \u03c4 -function\nin (7) is determined by the size of the matrix A. Namely, one has N\u2212 = M \u2212 N and\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n9\n\nN+ = N , where N\u00b1 denote the number of line solitons as y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e [20, 21, 23]. Further\nanalysis of the totally non-negative matrix A leads to the precise identification of the line\nsolitons and a comprehensive classification scheme for all line-soliton solutions of the\nKP equation. The latter problem is related to the classification of the non-negative cells\nGr+ (N, M ) of the Grassmannian Gr(N, M ) in terms of certain types of permutations\ncalled derangements [21].\n\nIt is worth noting that the equivalence between the Grammian and Wronskian forms\nof the line-soliton \u03c4 -function is not unique to the KP equation but applies also to other\nequations whose \u03c4 -functions are represented in both forms. Examples include several\n2 + 1-dimensional differential-difference equations such as the 2d-Toda, 2d-Volterra and\nthe differential-difference KP equation as well as difference-difference equations such as\nthe fully discrete 2d-Toda and the discrete KP (Hirota-Miwa) equation. These will be\ndiscussed in future works.\n\n3.\n\nO- and P-type 2-solitons\n\nIn this section the soliton interactions associated with certain types of 2-soliton solutions\nof the KP equation will be investigated. These solutions are characterized by a pair of line\nsolitons as |y| \u2192 \u221e. Thus, N\u2212 = N+ = 2, which implies that N = 2 and M = 4. The\nWronskian form of the \u03c4 -function for these solutions is obtained from (7) in terms of the\nordered set k1 < k2 < k3 < k4 of distinct real parameters and a 2 \u00d7 4 totally non-negative\nmatrix A as,\n\u03c4 (x, y, t) =\n\nX\n\n(ks \u2212 kr ) A(r, s) e\u03b8r +\u03b8s ,\n\n(14)\n\n1\u2264r<s\u22644\n\nwhere A(r, s) denotes the 2 \u00d7 2 minors of the matrix A. Taking into account the irreducibility property mentioned in Section 2, there are exactly seven distinct types of totally\nnon-negative 2 \u00d7 4 matrices, which lead to seven different types of 2-soliton solutions\nof the KP equation [21, 23]. In contrast, its (1+1)-dimensional version namely, the KdV\nequation has only one kind of 2-soliton solution. This is indicative of a much richer solution space for the (2+1)-dimensional integrable equations than the (1+1)-dimensional\nones.\nThe particular 2-soliton solutions whose nonlinear interaction properties are studied\nhere, are the O-type 2-soliton which was mentioned in section 2, and another one called\nthe P-type (\"P\" for physical), which fits better with the physical description of oblique\ninteractions of shallow water waves for which the KP equation is a good approximation.\nIn both of these cases, a pair of line solitons interact to form a X-shape in the xy -plane but\nthe details of the interactions are entirely different. The corresponding coefficient matrices\nin RREF are given by\nAO =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1100\n,\n0011\n\nAP =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0 0 \u22121\n011 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nwhich, from (14), lead to the \u03c4 -functions\n\u03c4O = (k3 \u2212 k1 )e\u03b81 +\u03b83 + (k3 \u2212 k2 )e\u03b82 +\u03b83 + (k4 \u2212 k1 )e\u03b81 +\u03b84 + (k4 \u2212 k2 )e\u03b82 +\u03b84 ,\n\u03c4P = (k2 \u2212 k1 )e\u03b81 +\u03b82 + (k3 \u2212 k1 )e\u03b81 +\u03b83 + (k4 \u2212 k2 )e\u03b82 +\u03b84 + (k4 \u2212 k3 )e\u03b83 +\u03b84 .\n\nApplying the principle of dominant balance mentioned in the examples given in Section 2,\nit is possible to identify the line solitons in the two cases. For the O-type the line solitons\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018\n\n18:35\n\nApplicable Analysis\n\naa\n\n10\n\nFigure 2. An O-type 2-soliton.

Here, each of the [1, 2] and [3, 4] line soliton makes an angle \u03c8 with the y-axis.\n\nFurthermore, umax depends non-linearly on the incidence angle between the two line\nsolitons. In order to investigate this behavior, it is convenient to choose the parameters\nk1 , . . . , k4 such that k1 = \u2212k4 and k2 = \u2212k3 = \u2212k (see Figure 3(a)). Then the two\nline solitons are placed symmetrically about the y-axis, and are of equal amplitude, i.e.,\nA1 = A2 = A. Denoting the angle between the [3, 4]\u221a\n-soliton and the y -axis by \u03c8 as shown\nin Figure 3(b), it follows that tan \u03c8 = (k3 + k4 ) = 2A + 2k. Since k > 0, the angle \u03c8\nis always greater than the critical angle\n\u221a\n\u03c8c = tan\u22121 ( 2A) ,\n\nwhich depends on the amplitude of the line solitons. Setting k1 = \u2212k4 , k2 = \u2212k3 in the\nexpression for C above, it can be deduced from (15) that\numax =\n\n4A\n\u221a\n,\n1 + 1 \u2212 s2\n\ns=\n\ntan \u03c8c\n<1\ntan \u03c8\n\nTherefore, umax is a decreasing function of the angle \u03c8 , and as \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8c (i.e., k \u2192 0), the\npeak interaction amplitude umax \u2192 4A. Note that in the limit k = 0, the parameters k2 =\nk3 , which implies that the \u03c4 -function \u03c4O contains only three instead of four exponential\nterms. The resulting solution u(x, y, t) of the KP equation is a Miles' Y-shape solution\ncorresponding to the confluence of three line solitons interacting resonantly [11] (see also\n[23]). The dependence of umax with the angle of interaction is shown in Figure 4 for\nsoliton amplitudes A = 1 and A = 2.

In contrast to the O-type, the P-type\n2-soliton solution u(x, y, t) corresponds to saddle at the interaction point \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0.\nThe value of the solution at the interaction point is\nuint = A1 + A2 + 2C\n\np\nA1 A2 .\n\n(16)\n\nSince C < 0 for the P-type solution, uint is always less than the sum of the amplitudes of\nthe line solitons [1, 4] and [2, 3]. A more precise bound for uint is obtained as follows [23]:\nFrom the above expression for C , one can calculate\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 xy\n1 \u2212 \u2206P\n1 \u2212 (x + y)\n\u221a\n\u2212C =\n,\n=p\n\u221a\n\u221a = p\n1 + \u2206P\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) + xy\n( (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) + xy)2\n\nwhere x =\n\nk2 \u2212k1\nk4 \u2212k1\n\nand y =\n\nk4 \u2212k3\nk4 \u2212k1 .\n\n\u221a\nxy \u2264 21 (x + y) ,\n\nSince 0 < x, y < 1, the following inequalities\np\n\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) \u2264 1 \u2212 21 (x + y)\n\nhold, and from these it can be easily deduced that\nlatter inequality leads to\n\np\n\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) +\n\nr\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u2206P\nA2\nk3 \u2212 k2\n\u221a\n\u2265 1 \u2212 (x + y) =\n=\n.\nk4 \u2212 k1\nA1\n1 + \u2206P\n\n\u221a\n\nxy \u2264 1.

For\nsimplicity, we take the [1, 4]-soliton along the y -axis by setting k1 + k4 = 0, and denote\nby \u03c8 the angle between the solitons as in Figure 5(b). Then\np\np\ntan \u03c8 = k2 + k3 = 2(k2 \u2212 k1 ) \u2212 ( 2A1 \u2212 2A2 ) ,\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nafter using k1 + k4 = 0. Similarly, one\n\u221a calculates\n\u221a (k2 \u2212 k1 ) + (k4 \u2212 k3 ) = 2A1 \u2212 2A2 ,\nwhich implies that 0 < k2 \u2212 k1 < 2A1 \u2212 2A2 . Hence for fixed amplitudes A1 and\nA2 , the angle \u03c8 between the two line solitons satisfies\n\u2212\u03c8c < \u03c8 < \u03c8c ,\n\np\np\n\u03c8c = tan\u22121 ( 2A1 \u2212 2A2 ) .\n\nThe limiting cases \u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c8c correspond to k1 = k2 or k3 = k4 . Either case leads to\na degeneration of the P-type 2-soliton to a Y-shape solution similar to O-type 2-soliton\nsituation. In terms of A1 , A2 and the angle \u03c8 , the quantity \u2206P can be expressed as\n\u2206P =\n\ntan2 \u03c8c \u2212 tan2 \u03c8\n(k2 \u2212 k1 )(k4 \u2212 k3 )\n\u221a\n= \u221a\n,\n(k3 \u2212 k1 )(k4 \u2212 k2 )\n( 2A1 + 2A2 )2 \u2212 tan2 \u03c8\n\nand then from (16) one obtains\nuint =\n\n1\n2\n\nh\n\ntan2 \u03c8 +\n\nq\n\ni\np\np\n(tan2 \u03c8c \u2212 tan2 \u03c8)(( 2A1 + 2A2 )2 \u2212 tan2 \u03c8) .\n\nIt follows from the above expression that uint is an even function of the angle \u03c8 between\nthe line solitons [1, 4] and [2, 3] for |\u03c8| < \u03c8c . When \u03c8 = 0, i.e., when the two line solitons\nare both parallel to the y -axis, uint reaches its maximum value of A1 \u2212 A2 which is the\ndifference between the amplitudes of the two line solitons. As \u03c8 \u2192\nthe interaction\n\u221a \u00b1\u03c8c , \u221a\namplitude approaches its lower bound, i.e., uint \u2192 21 tan2 \u03c8c = ( A1 \u2212 A2 )2 .

Such solutions exhibit a variety of time-dependent spatial patterns due to resonant soliton interactions (Y-shape) as well as non-resonant interactions (X-shape). The exact analytic form of these solutions can be derived from the associated \u03c4 -functions which are expressible either as Wronskians or as Gram determinants. It\nis remarkable that the KP equation possesses such a rich structure of line-soliton solutions\ngenerated from a simple form of the \u03c4 -function. It turns out that the solution manifold of\nthe line-solitons is parametrized by a discrete set of real distinct parameters and the space\nof totally non-negative matrices. This characterization is clear from the Wronskian form\nof the KP \u03c4 -function but not so transparent from its Grammian form. It is perhaps due\nto this difficulty in imposing appropriate regularity conditions that only a handful of linesoliton solutions were explicitly known via the direct algebraic methods which used the\nGrammian form of the \u03c4 -function. This issue has been resolved in this article where a\none-to-one correspondence between the two forms of the line-soliton \u03c4 -function has been\nestablished. Consequently, it is now possible to derive non-singular line-soliton solutions\nusing the Grammian form of the \u03c4 -function as well.\nAnother problem discussed in this article is the nonlinear soliton interactions for certain\ntypes of 2-soliton solutions. In particular, the amplitude of the nonlinear interaction has\nbeen explicitly calculated from the exact analytic expression for each of the 2-soliton\nsolutions considered in this paper. Moreover, the dependence of the interaction amplitude\non the angle between the line solitons has been investigated by keeping the line soliton\namplitudes fixed. One possible physical significance of such results lies in the study of\noblique nonlinear interactions of weakly 2-dimensional solitary waves in shallow water.\nThe physical mechanism generating large amplitude waves of extreme elevations from the\ninteraction of two (or more) smaller amplitude solitary waves in shallow water constitutes\nan important open problem. It is believed that in appropriate parameter regimes the linesolitons of the KP equation can serve as a reasonably good test-bed for the description\nand analysis of nonlinear solitary wave dynamics. As a qualitative evidence, one may\nconsider the simple example of the O-type 2-soliton interaction where the interaction peak\namplitude may reach as high as four times the amplitude of the individual line solitons.\nFor both O- and P-type solutions, the range of this interaction angle is found to be limited by a critical value \u03c8c which depends on the amplitudes of the line solitons. It is however important to note that the theory of KP line-solitons can still be applied to study wave\ninteraction where the angle between the incident waves is outside of the prescribed range\nfor the O- or the P-type soliton solutions. In such cases, the wave dynamics is governed\nby other types of KP 2-soliton solutions which have recently been uncovered [17, 20, 21].\nThe study of the interaction properties of these newly found solutions is a topic of future\ninvestigation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Yuji Kodama for useful discussions.
