In the particular\ncase of a single chirped optical pulse, the beat frequency\nincreases linearly after passage through resonance, following the increase of resonance mismatch [15]. On the\ncontrary to these previous studies, the present report involves CT directly observed on the population before relaxation becomes significant. The beats result here from\ninterferences between the resonant and non-resonance excitation paths. The passage through resonance does not\nlead to total inversion [16]. Thus non-resonant excitation\ncan lead to population transfer after resonance. However, these extra contributions have a phase which varies\nrapidly with respect to the phase of the dominant contribution, leading to population oscillations.\nIn this letter, we describe theoretically the temporal evolution of the excited state population induced by\nchirped pulse excitation in the low field regime. The\nCT oscillating pattern is experimentally studied on the\nRb (5s \u2192 5p) transition. The 5p population is probed\n\"in real time\" by a second excitation induced by an ultrashort pulse overlapping partially with the excitation\npulse. These results illustrate the relative importance of\nthe various stages of the interaction. Most of the population transfer occurs at resonance. The small fraction of excited state amplitude transferred after resonance leads to strong interferences, whereas interaction\nbefore resonance results in negligible effects. In order\nto point out the different stages of the interaction, two\ncases are investigated, the first being when resonance is\nreached at the middle of the interaction (on-resonance\ncase) and secondly when the resonance is reached earlier\n(off-resonance case).\nThe excitation scheme is depicted on Fig. 1.

The Coherent Transients are measured directly on the excited state\npopulation on an ultrashort time scale. A sharp step corresponds to the passage through resonance. It is followed by\noscillations resulting from interferences between off-resonant\nand resonant contributions. We finally show the equivalence\nbetween this experiment and Fresnel diffraction by a sharp\nedge.\n\nCoherent excitation of atomic transitions is a general\nphenomenon occurring whenever electromagnetic radiation interacts with atoms. This interaction may result\nin various kinds of processes, for example Rabi oscillations, free induction decay, adiabatic population transfer\nand Coherent Transients (CT) [1]. By simply varying the\ntemporal shape of the pulses, a great variety of systems\ncan be manipulated such as spins in Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance [2] or atomic and molecular systems in coherent control schemes [3]. We consider here the simplest\ncase of linearly chirped pulses where the \"instantaneous\nfrequency\" drifts in time.\nDepending on the frequency sweep and on the intensity, adiabatic following can be observed with a significant population transfer. For example total population\ntransfer has been achieved via multilevel ladder climbing\n[4\u20139] and Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage [10].\nOn the contrary if the adiabaticity criterion is not fulfilled, the final population depends crucially on the pulse\nintegral and CT dominate the interaction. This letter\npresents theoretical and experimental studies of these\nCoherent Transients. Although many works have dealt\nwith the transfer efficiency into the final state, we report\nhere the first direct observation of these transients on a\nsubpicosecond time scale. The CT result in oscillating\npopulation. This is a signature of interferences between\nresonant and non-resonant excitation. A detailed understanding of this behaviour is crucial to analyze pumpprobe experiments in which dynamics takes place on the\nsame time scale as laser interaction. Due to the difficulty\nto control properly the laser pulses, the effects of CT are\nmost often ignored [11].\nSimilarities can be found with optical CT observed in\nthe experiments of free induction decay or photon echoes\nwhich provide relaxation rates [12\u201314].

Moreover, to measure the \"instantaneous\" excited state population (in state |ei), the probe pulse is assumed to be\nnearly Fourier transform limited (\u03c6\u2032\u20322 \u2243 0), and of short\nduration compared to the chirped pump pulse duration\n(\u03c42 \u226a \u03c41c ). This will ensure that the final state population (in state |f i) reproduces the |ei state population.\n\nefficiency. As time increases from t0 , new contributions\nare added to the amplitude ae (t). These contributions\nhave a phase which increases more and more rapidly,\nleading alternatively to an increase and a decrease of the\nexcited state amplitude.\nIn order to illustrate the coherent transients, an experiment has been performed in Rubidium atoms. The\n(5s - 5p (2 P1/2 )) transition (at 795 nm) is excited either\nwith a Fourier transform limited pulse or with a chirped\npulse. The laser bandwidth of \u223c 10 nm limits the excitation of the other fine structure component 5p (2 P3/2 ))\ntransition (at 780 nm). The transient excited state population is probed on the (5p - ns,n'd) transitions with an\nultrashort pulse (at 607 nm).\nThe laser system is based on a conventional Ti: Sapphire laser with chirped pulse amplification (Spitfire\nSpectra Physics) producing 130 fs pulses around 795 nm\nat a 1 kHz repetition rate with energy of as much as\n800 \u03bcJ. Half of the light is used as the pump pulse. The\nother half feeds a home made Non-collinear Optical Parametric Amplifier (NOPA) [17] compressed with Brewster8d-10s\n7d-9s\ncut prisms, which delivers pulses of a few microJoules,\n6d-8s\n30 fs (after compression), centered around 607 nm.

This corresponds to the intersients.

Non-resonant transitions can also conDue to the smaller efficiency of the off-resonance excitribute to the excited state amplitude, but with a smaller\n\n`\n\n2\n\n\fdeduced from the geometry of the stretcher. An excellent agreement on the oscillation pattern is obtained. The\ncontrast of the first periods is well reproduced. It drops\nmore rapidly in the experiment. Several causes can be\ninvoked : residual spatial chirps or small incoherent components of the pump pulse. After the sharp step, the oscillation frequency of the interferences increases linearly\nwith time : \u03c9eg \u2212\u03c91 (t) = t/\u03c6\u2032\u20321 . For a pulse frequency below resonance and a negative chirp, the passage through\nresonance occurs at the beginning of the pulse. Thus the\nmajor part of the pump spectral components contributes\nafter the resonance so that many oscillations result as\ncan be seen on Fig. 3. On the contrary, in the resonant\ncase, only the second half of the pulse contributes to the\ninterferences and fewer oscillations are observed.\nAn other way to explain the CT phenomenon is to examine the behaviour of ae (t) in the complex plane as\ndisplayed in the insets of Fig. 4 for \u03c6\u2032\u20321 = \u22128. 105 fs2 .\nTwo examples obtained via a numerical resolution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation are given. They correspond to the\nexperimental data shown on the same figure. The probability amplitude follows a double spiral starting from\n(0, 0). Three regions can be distinguished. The two spirals result from contributions before (I) and after (III)\nresonance.\nThe intermediate\nregion (II : time interh\np i\np\nval t0 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u20321 ; t0 + \u03c6\u2032\u20321 ) corresponds to the passage\nthrough resonance. It provides the main contribution\nto the population. This contribution is characterized by\na sharp increase of |ae (t)|, in an almost \"straight\" direction as expected from the stationary phase approximation applied to Eq. 1. The two spirals play different\nroles. The first one (I) winds round the origin with an increasing radius. The resulting probability increases thus\nslowly and regularly. After resonance (III), a second spiral winds round the asymptotic value leading to strong\noscillations. For a central laser frequency equal to the resonance frequency, the two spirals have the same weight\n(Fig. 4a). Detuning of the laser frequency changes their\nrelative weight (Fig. 4b). For negative chirp and negative detuning, the second spiral (after resonance) has a\nlarger weight since resonance is reached during the first\nhalf of the pulse. This leads to a higher number of oscillations, as can be observed by comparing Fig. 2 and\n3. Conversely, a negative chirp and positive detuning\nreduces the number of oscillations.\nThe general expression of the excited state amplitude\n(Eq. 1) presents strong similarities with Fresnel diffraction of a gaussian beam by a sharp edge. Effectively, the\nspirals displayed on Fig. 4 are similar to the well-known\nCornu spirals. In Eq. 1 the variable t corresponds to the\nposition of the sharp edge in the gaussian beam. Without detuning, Eq. 1 reproduces the classical diffraction\nfigure on axis. The effect of detuning can be understood\nby observing in a slant direction \u03b8, with sin \u03b8 \u221d \u2206\u03c9.\nOther analogies between time and space Fresnel\n\ntation (\u03bb = 801 nm, Fig. 3), the fluence was increased\n2\nto 110 \u03bcJ/cm , inducing some power effects. However,\nexperiments performed for different fluences show qualitatively the same behaviour.\n\n6p-5s Fluorescence (a.u.)\n\n1,6\n1,4\n1,2\n1,0\n1,4\n1,2\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n0,6\n0,4\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n-1,0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-0,5\n\n0,0\n\n2\n4\nDelay (ps)\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n6\n\n8\n\n6p-5s Fluorescence (a.u.)\n\nFIG. 2.

Indeed, in the case of long chirped pulse, the experimental determination of the time delay origin is a real\nchallenge via standard setup based on frequency mixing.\nThe CT scheme could provide an alternate experimental\ndetermination of both time origin and long linear chirp\nmeasurements. The only fitted parameter is the value of\nthe chirp which differs by less than 2% from the estimates\n3\n\n\faccurate measurement of the chirp. This scheme can be\nextended to nonlinear variations of the chirp which could\nthus be measured in a direct way. Moreover, in pumpprobe experiments as well as in any experiment based on\na combination of ultrashort pulses, such coherent transients should be taken carefully into account to analyze\nthe data. Finally based on this phenomenon, new pulse\nshaping schemes could be developed to improve the transfer efficiency.\nWe enjoyed fruitful discussions with Jacques Vigu\u00e9,\nFranois Biraben, Franois Nez, Pierre Glorieux, Jacques\nDupont-Roc and Serge Haroche. Stimulating advices\nfrom E. Riedle and M. Zavelani-Rossi are sincerely acknowledged.\n\ndiffraction have been reported by several groups [20,21].\nOne example deals with two-photon absorption (or frequency doubling) from a chirped pulse [20]. The spatial\ncoordinate was associated to the laser frequency instead\nof the pump probe delay in our present case. By inserting\nmasks on the laser spectrum, the equivalent of a Fresnel\nzone lens was reproduced in the spectral domain. The\nfrequency doubled pulse was thus spectrally focused. In\nour case, pulse shaping of the laser pump pulse should\nprovide similar effects as a Fresnel lens. For instance, by\nslicing the temporal profile of the pump pulse, it should\nbe possible to suppress the destructive interference contributions to ae (t) and increase significantly its asymptotic value.\n2,6\n2,4\n\n(a)\n\n2,2\n\n1,8\n\n1,4\n\n0,05\n\nI\n\n0,00\n\n1,2\n1,0\n0,8\n\nII\n\n-0,05\n-0,10\n-0,15\n-0,20\n\n0,6\n\nIII\n\n-0,1\n\n0,0\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\nRe(ae(t))\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\n0,5\n0,15\n\nI\n\nIII\n\nII\n\n0,10\n\n0,4\n\nIm(ae(t))\n\n6p-5s Fluorescence (a.u.)\n\n[1] L.
