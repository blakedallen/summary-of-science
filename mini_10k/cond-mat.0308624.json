In particular random graphs, that is graphs extracted with some\nprobability from a suitable statistical ensemble, are interesting as a mean to implement the intrinsic complexity and/or\nchaotic nature of many physical, biological and social systems [1].\nAmong graphs, trees (that is graphs without loops) play a distinguished role: they retain a deep interest and wide\napplicability while still being amenable to detailed analytic studies. Random trees appears in several distinct contexts,\nlike polymer physics, critical percolation [2] and two\u2013dimensional quantum gravity (branched polymers [3]).\nGenerically, in a random graph the local coordination is itself a random variable taking values according to some\nprobability distribution; while in the classical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi theory of random graphs [4] this distribution is Poissonian,\nin several examples of \"experimental\" complex networks it turns out to be \"scale-free\", that is with a long power-law\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: Luca.Donetti@mib.infn.it\naddress: Claudio.Destri@mib.infn.it\n\n\ftail [5]. This implies that on an infinite scale-free graph nodes with diverging coordination are rather frequent, causing\nsome subtleties in the application of the law of large numbers.\nIn this paper we concentrate our attention to homogeneous scale-free random trees subject only to the physically\nnatural constraint of being embeddable in a finite dimensional Euclidean space. This class of random trees has been\nstudied already in [6, 7], although from a viewpoint different from ours: while in these works only some statistical\naverages relevant to characterize the geometry of these trees were analyzed, we study here in depth the probability\ndistributions of the basic observables which specify the intrinsic geometry. Our results apply therefore to any single\n\"generic\" (infinite) scale-free random tree and not just to their statistical ensemble.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. First of all we recall some definitions of graph theory and we introduce the\nalgorithm used to build homogeneous random trees, summarizing known results. The local connectivity dimension\nis then obtained from the scaling properties of the probability distributions for the volume and the surface of the\nspheres centered at the origin of the tree-constructing algorithm. Details of the scaled probabilities are studied and\ntheir asymptotic behavior is determined. Then the probability distributions for the graph-averaged volume and the\nsurface are considered; the average connectivity dimension is extracted from their scaling properties.\nOur results for the growth properties of a random tree can be summarized in very concise heuristic formulas as\nfollows: consider a sphere (intrinsically defined in terms of the chemical distance alone) of radius r centered on some\nnode; for large r the volume v of the sphere and the coordination fluctuation \u2206z within the sphere are random\nvariables simply related as\nv \u2243 (\u2206z)2 r2\nThis relation apply to all random trees with bounded growth rate (see below) regardless of whether \u2206z has a finite\nlimit as v \u2192 \u221e or not. In the former case, as it happens for instance on trees with bounded coordination, one\nreads immediately out the connectivity dimension dc = 2. In the latter case, one need to estimate the asymptotic\ndependence of \u2206z on v. For scale-free trees with tail exponent 2 < \u03b2 < 3 (see below for the proper definitions), one\nfinds \u2206z \u223c v (3\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u22121) , yielding the \u03b2\u2212dependent connectivity dimension\ndc =\n\n\u03b2\u22121\n\u03b2\u22122\n\nSuppose instead that one is interested in the graph-averaged volume v obtained by averaging over all locations of the\ncenter of the sphere (for a finite tree with large volume V ). The random variable v is related to the coordination\nfluctuation \u2206z over the whole tree just as before, that is\nv \u2243 (\u2206z)2 r2\nNow the behavior in r is always quadratic, regardless of the way the coordinations are distributed. Of course, in\nthe scale-free trees with 2 < \u03b2 < 3 one has \u2206z \u223c V (3\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u22121) , making it impossible to consider the standard\nthermodynamic limit V \u2192 \u221e. Nonetheless, we find that a well defined limit exists for the \"renormalized\" volume\nv V (\u03b2\u22123)/(\u03b2\u22121) . Therefore, in all cases we conclude for the average connectivity dimension\nd \u0304c = 2\nFinally, in the last section, the analysis of the probability distribution for the effective squared mass, defined through\nthe Gaussian model on the tree, allows us to rigorously determine also the local spectral dimension ds . It fulfills\nthe long-conjectured [8] relation ds = 2dc /(dc + 1) already verified in [7] through a general but completely different\nargument.\nII.\nA.\n\nRANDOM TREES\n\nGeneralities about graphs\n\nA graph G is defined by a set of nodes (finite or countable), pairwise connected by a set of unordered links. If the set\nof nodes is finite, its cardinality will be denoted by |G|. The coordination number (or degree, or simply coordination)\nof a node x is the number of its nearest neighbors and it is denoted by zx . The intrinsic properties of the graph are\ndetermined only by the connections between the nodes; the metric is given by the so-called chemical distance: the\ndistance d(x, y) is equal to the number of links of the shortest connected path between x and y. This distance is used\nto define spheres; the \"volume\" vr (x) is defined as the number of nodes of the radius r sphere centered at node x,\n\n\fand the \"surface\" sr (x) is the number of nodes of the corresponding spherical shell. Here we shall consider connected\ngraphs in the limit of infinitely many nodes.\nGiven a function F defined on the nodes, its average value F is defined as the infinite radius limit of the average\nover spheres; if such limit exists, it does not depend on the center of the spheres provided F is bounded from below\nand the graph has a bounded growth rate [9], that is the surface vanishes with respect to the volume in the infinite\nsize limit.\nThe properties of graphs can be described by various parameters; here we consider the connectivity dimension [10]\nand the spectral dimension [11]. The connectivity dimension describes how the volume of spheres scales with its\nradius r for r \u2192 \u221e; we can define a local connectivity dimension dc using the spheres centered on any given node x\nvr (x) \u223c rdc\n\n(1)\n\nIt is not difficult to show that dc does not depend on x when the graph has a bounded growth rate. We can define\nalso an average dimension d \u0304c , if the average volume is used (provided the limit defining it exists finite)\n \u0304\n\nvr \u223c rdc\n\n(2)\n\nThese two connectivity dimensions usually coincide, but on strongly inhomogeneous graphs they can be different [12].\nThe spectral dimension is related to long time properties of random walks on the graph, as well as to many other\nphysical properties such as the infrared behavior of the Gaussian model [13]. On a generic connected graph G this\nmodel is defined by assigning a real-valued random variable \u03c6x to each node x \u2208 G with the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\n1 X 2 1 X\n(\u03c6x \u2212 \u03c6y )2\n\u03bc0\n\u03c6x +\n2\n2\nx\n\n(3)\n\nhx,yi\n\nwhere hx, yi denotes nearest neighbors pairs of nodes and \u03bc0 > 0 is a free parameter (the squared mass in field\u2013\ntheoretic sense). The spectral dimension is determined by the infrared \u03bc0 \u2192 0 singularity of the diagonal element of\nthe covariance\nd /2\u22121\n\nSing hh\u03c62x ii \u223c \u03bc0s\n\n(4)\n\nwhere hh*ii denotes standard Gibbs expectation values weighted with exp(\u2212H). One can show that ds does not depend\non the choice of the node x [13]. As for the connectivity dimension, it is possible to split the spectral dimension into\na local one and an average one. The definition in eq. (4) evidently corresponds to the local one; the average spectral\ndimension d \u0304s characterizes in the same way the singularity of the graph average of hh\u03c62x ii. Again, the two dimensions\nusually coincide, but on strongly inhomogeneous graphs they can be different [12].\nSuppose now that a certain statistical ensemble G of (infinite) graphs is given. As a consequence, connectivity\nand spectral dimensions become in principle random variables with probability distributions derived from the \"microscopic\" one specifying G. Consider the connectivity dimension: if the graphs of G are rooted, we can use the root,\ndenoted by o, as the center of the spheres those growth define dc ; then the corresponding volumes vr (o) are random\nvariables distributed with some probability Pr[vr (o) = v]. If this probability has a well defined scaling behavior for\nr \u2192 \u221e, that is\n1 \u0010v\u0011\nPr[vr (o) = v] \u2243 d p d\nr\nr\nthen the random variable vr (o)r\u2212d has a well defined probability distribution in the limit r \u2192 \u221e and we may write\nagain\nvr (o) \u223c rd\nas in eq. (1), identifying d with a non-fluctuating local connectivity dimension dc . In other words dc is a property\nof a \"generic\" specimen of the ensemble, that is a a property of G itself. A similar argument applies to the average\nconnectivity dimension d \u0304c and to the spectral dimensions using the random variable hh\u03c62x ii and its graph average.\nAn alternative approach is used in ref. [6], where averages in the canonical or grand-canonical ensembles of certain\nrandom trees (i.e. graphs without loops) are studied rather than a single \"generic\" sample tree. Two parameters\nare introduced to describe the intrinsic geometry of these trees, also called \"branched polymers\": the Hausdorff\ndimensions dH and dL . The former is related to how the average two-point distance on graphs with V nodes scales\nwith the size V :\nhd(x, y)iV \u223c V 1/dH\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe latter (called local Hausdorff dimension in [6]) is related to the behavior of the two-points correlation function\n(2)\ngV (r) (proportional to the number of couples of nodes which are at distance r) for distances which are large, but\nmuch smaller than V 1/dH :\n(2)\n\ngV (r)\n\nV \u2192\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\nrdL \u22121 ,\n\n1 \u226a r \u226a V 1/dH\n\n(6)\n\nIt is claimed in [6] that dH and dL differ on a certain class of \"exotic\" random trees characterized by unbounded local\ncoordinations.\nActually, it is not a priori obvious if and how parameters such as dH and dL are connected to the connectivity\ndimensions dc and d \u0304c , although it is common lore to identify the Hausdorff dimension with the connectivity dimension\nwhen no distinction is made about local or average dimensions. One of the aims of the present work is just to fully\nanswer this question in the case of homogeneous random trees, as we shall see below.\nB.\n\nGeneralities about random trees\n\nHomogeneous random trees are built by the random independent extraction of every node's degree from a given\ndistribution fz . This process can be formulated as a Galton-Watson branching process [14]; in particular, since we\nare interested in trees with bounded growth rate, we must consider the critical Galton-Watson case. The given\ncoordination distribution must be properly normalized\nX\nfz = 1\n(7)\nz\n\nand the average coordination must be equal to 2 because of the condition of bounded growth rate (see ref. [9])\nX\nhzi =\nzfz = 2\n\n(8)\n\nz\n\nClearly these sums have a finite number of addends if the coordination is bounded, while they become series if it is\nunbounded as in the scale-free case. The series, however, must be properly convergent in order equations (7) and (8)\nto hold, so that fz must vanish faster than z \u22122 for z \u2192 \u221e. Let us also introduce the probability generating function\ng(\u03bb)\nX\ng(\u03bb) =\nfz \u03bbz\u22121 = f1 + f2 \u03bb + f3 \u03bb2 + . . .\n(9)\nz\n\nwhich enjoys the properties\ng(1) = 1 ,\n\ng \u2032 (1) = 1\n\n(10)\n\neasily derived from those of fz .\nA branching process effectively ends when a shell (that is a given generation of sibling branches) is made only by\nnodes with coordination 1, so that the next shell is empty. The trees produced in this way are all finite because the\nsurviving probability after r generations vanishes for r \u2192 \u221e in the critical Galton-Watson process [14]. Since we\nare interested in the thermodynamic limit we have two possibilities [9]. The first one is an explicit preconditioning\non non-extinction: this means that modified branching probabilities are used to avoid finite trees, while keeping\nunaltered the properties of the infinite trees [15]. This is achieved if the root coordination is chosen with probability\nfz while on every successive shell the coordination of the first node is extracted with a modified probability distribution\nf \u0303z = (z \u2212 1)fz . The other possibility consists in calculating probabilities conditioned on the number of nodes V of\nthe resulting trees, and then take the limit V \u2192 \u221e. In this latter case the root coordination must be extracted with\nthe refined probability\nfz\n,\nfbz = N1\nz\n\nX fz\n1\n=\nN1\nz\nz\n\n(11)\n\nsince the root has as many branches as its coordination while every other node has one branch less than its coordination\n[see section 3.1 of ref. [9] for details].\n\n\fC.\n\nTrees with bounded coordination\n\nIn [9] and [16] the geometrical and spectral properties of bounded random trees were determined using non-extinction\npreconditioning. The surface and volume probability, in the large radius limit, are shown to be function only of the\nscaled variables s/r and v/r2 , respectively. Moreover, after the discussion of the auto-averaging property, also average\nsurface and volume are fully analyzed. These results allow the rigorous determination of the connectivity dimension,\nboth local and average: dc = d \u0304c = 2. The study of the Gaussian model on such trees leads also to the determination\nof the spectral dimension ds = 4/3. Using a simple scaling hypothesis it is shown that the relation ds = 2dc /(dc + 1)\nshould hold on a wider class of random trees.\nAn important universality property is also found: all the average values and probability distributions in the large\nradius limit depend on the fz distribution only through its second moment or, equivalently, g \u2032\u2032 (1). This parameter\nquantifies the coordination fluctuations, since\nX\ng \u2032\u2032 (1) =\nfz [z \u2212 hzi]2\nz\n\nand characterizes all asymptotic behaviors. Altogether, these results can be summarized as\nv \u2243 g \u2032\u2032 (1) r2\n\n(12)\n\nmeaning that v/[g \u2032\u2032 (1)r2 ], as r \u2192 \u221e, is a random variable with a well defined universal probability distribution.\nThe approach based of the grand-canonical ensemble of branched polymers yields the result dH = dL = 2 when the\ncoordination of each node is bounded. This corresponds to the \"generic phase\" of random trees according to [6].\nD.\n\nScale-free trees\n\nIn this paper we turn to scale-free trees, that is trees whose coordination distribution has a long power\u2013law tail:\nfz \u2243 A z \u2212\u03b2 ,\n\nfor z \u2192 \u221e\n\nwhere \u03b2 > 2. When the coordination is unbounded, the function g(\u03bb) may have singularities; in the scale-free case it\nbecomes singular for \u03bb = 1. For any non-integer exponent1 its expansion contains a term proportional to (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b2\u22121 ,\nthat is:\ng(\u03bb) = ga (\u03bb) + c\u2217 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b2\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nga (\u03bb) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb) + c2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)2 + . . . + ck (1 \u2212 \u03bb)k + . . .\n\n(14)\n\nwhere ga (\u03bb) is analytic in \u03bb = 1\n\nand c\u2217 = A \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2). Therefore, if 2 < \u03b2 < 3, g \u2032\u2032 (\u03bb) diverges for \u03bb \u2192 1; since we found g \u2032\u2032 (1) to be an important\nparameter in the bounded coordination case, we expect this divergence to have many important consequences. As a\nfirst example it causes the divergence of hvr (o)i, the expected volume of the balls around the root of the branching\nprocess. This can be intuitively explained, using non-extinction preconditioning, because on every shell the coordination of one node is chosen with probability distribution f \u0303z , whose first moment is infinite. If auto-averaging holds,\nthen also vr would diverge on a single scale-free tree and the definition (2) of average connectivity dimension appears\ntroublesome for scale-free trees. Thus, in order to deal with finite graph-averaged quantities, we will also use the finite\nvolume approach, regarding the volume V as a regulator.\nWe may then find an heuristic argument based on eq. (12) to determine the connectivity dimensions dc and d \u0304c for\nscale-free random trees. First of all, if \u03b2 > 3 nothing changes because g \u2032\u2032 (1) is still finite, so that dc = d \u0304c = 2. On the\ncontrary, if 2 < \u03b2 < 3, we have to face the divergence of g \u2032\u2032 (1). But coordination fluctuations are finite for a finite\nnumber N of nodes, and diverge with N in a way fixed by the long tail of fz , since all coordination extractions are\nindependent. Let zmax (N ) be the largest coordination extracted, estimated from\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\nfz \u223c zmax\n=\n\nz=zmax\n\n1\n\n1\nN\n\nfor integer \u03b2 the singularity has a different, logarithmic, form; however, since the final results will be analytic in \u03b2, one is able to extend\nthem also to integer values of \u03b2.\n\n\fthen we may estimate fluctuations by\nzmax (N )\n\nX\nz=1\n\n(z \u2212 hzi)2 fz \u223c [zmax (N )]3\u2212\u03b2 = N \u03bd\n\nwhere we defined the exponent \u03bd as\n\u03bd = (3 \u2212 \u03b2)/(\u03b2 \u2212 1)\nThus for the local growth we have the consistency relation\nvr \u2243 vr\u03bd r2\nwhich implies\nvr \u2243 r2/(1\u2212\u03bd) = r(\u03b2\u22121)/(\u03b2\u22122)\n\n\u21d2\n\ndc =\n\n\u03b2\u22121\n\u03b2\u22122\n\nWhen the graph-averaged vr is considered for trees of V nodes, the coordination fluctuation over the whole graph\nshould be used instead:\nvr \u2243 r2 V (3\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u22121)\nFrom this we read the scaling exponent 2 independently on V , but without the standard thermodynamic limit. Of\ncourse this is not a real proof and a more rigorous approach confirming these results is adopted in the following\nsections (see also Appendix A); at any rate, these exponents are the same as those calculated for scale-free branched\npolymers with 2 < \u03b2 < 3 in the grand-canonical approach: dH = (\u03b2 \u2212 1)/(\u03b2 \u2212 2) [7] and dL = 2 [6].\nIII.\nA.\n\nGROWTH STATISTICS\n\nScaling probabilities for local surface and volume\n\nThe probability Pr[sr (o) = s] (Pr[vr (o) = v]) for the surface (volume) of the radius r sphere around the root of an\ninfinite tree can be found, recursively on r, using the modified probabilities given by explicit preconditioning (see [9],\nwhere a slightly different notation is used).

In figure 1 the r = 10 volume probability corresponding to a tree with\n\u03b2 = 2.5 is plotted against the \"experimental\" frequency distribution; this is obtained by sampling, over 1000 different\ngraph of 8 * 106 nodes each, the volume of 2000 balls centered on randomly chosen nodes.

We shall\nreconstruct the dependence on V of the surface and volume probability distributions from the expectation values of\nsr (o) and vr (o) and their powers. We are lead to consider expectation values over finite-size trees, regarding their\nvolume V as a regulator, because the power-law tails with exponent 1\u2212\u03b2 found in the previous section for Pr[sr (o) = s]\nand Pr[vr (o) = v] imply the divergence with V of high enough moments of sr (o) or vr (o).\nLet us observe that in this context the average is made over all possible rooted trees with V nodes; this can also\nbe seen as the graph average over all nodes of an unrooted tree, which is then further averaged over all possible\nrealization of the unrooted tree, that is\nhOiV = hOiV\n\n(20)\n\nfor every observable O. In particular\nhsr (o)n iV = hsnr iV\nwith a similar relation for the volumes. No dependence on the root o survives and we shall drop it from the expectation\nvalues.\nLet us start by studying the probability Pb (V ) that any rooted tree T with V nodes is produced by the branching\nprocess without the non-extinction precondition\nPb (V ) = Pr[|T | = V ]\n\nBy the tree-producing algorithm, Pb (V ) satisfies the identity\nPb (V ) =\n\nX\nz\n\nfbz\n\nX\n\nV1 ,...,Vz\n\n\u03b4(V \u2212 1 \u2212\n\nz\nX\n\nVj )\n\nj=1\n\nz\nY\n\nP (Vj )\n\nj=1\n\nwhere P (V ) = Pr[|B| = V ] is the same probability relative to a branch B, that is a tree whose root has an incoming\nlink (and z \u2212 1 branches) and whose coordination is extracted with probability fz ; it satisfies a similar equation with\nz \u2212 1 instead of z and fz instead of fbz :\nP (V ) =\n\nX\nz\n\nb\nThe generating functions G(\u03bb)\n=\n\nP\n\nV\n\nfz\n\nX\n\nV1 ,...,Vz\u22121\n\n\u03b4(V \u2212 1 \u2212\n\nPb (V )\u03bbV and G(\u03bb) =\n\nG(\u03bb) = \u03bb g(G(\u03bb))\n\n,\n\nP\n\nV\n\nz\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\nVj )\n\nz\u22121\nY\n\nP (Vj )\n\nj=1\n\nP (V )\u03bbV satisfy\n\nb\nG(\u03bb)\n= \u03bb gb(G(\u03bb))\n\nwhere g(\u03bb) is the usual probability generating function defined in equation (9), while\nX\ngb(\u03bb) =\n\u03bbz fbz\n\n(21)\n\nz\n\nNormalization of fbz implies b\ng (1) = 1 and from the definition easily follows that gb(\u03bb) derivatives are proportional to\nthose of g(\u03bb); more precisely we have\ngb(k) (\u03bb) = N1 g (k\u22121) (\u03bb)\n\n\fSince we are interested in the V \u2192 \u221e limit, which corresponds to \u03bb \u2192 1, we can use expansions (13) and (14) to\nb\nobtain the asymptotic behavior of G(\u03bb) and G(\u03bb).\nFor different values of \u03b2 we have different situations depending on\nwhich term, the singular one or the quadratic one, is lower order.\nFor \u03b2 > 3 we have\n\u22121/2\n\nG(\u03bb) \u2243 1 \u2212 c2\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)1/2\n\n\u22121/2\nb\nG(\u03bb)\n\u2243 1 \u2212 N1 c2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)1/2\n\nso that, in the V \u2192 \u221e, the probability Pb (V ) reads\n\n1\nPb (V ) \u2243 N1 \u221a\nV \u22123/2\n2 c2 \u03c0\n\nFor 2 < \u03b2 < 3, instead, the singular term produces\n\n\u22121/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\nG(\u03bb) \u2243 1 \u2212 c\u2217\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)1/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\n\u22121/(\u03b2\u22121)\nb\nG(\u03bb)\n\u2243 1 \u2212 N 1 c\u2217\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)1/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\nThus we have, for V \u2192 \u221e\n\n\u22121/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\n\u2212c\u2217\nPb(V ) \u2243 N1\nV \u2212\u03b2/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\u0393(\u22121/(\u03b2 \u2212 1))\n\n(22)\n\nLet us now turn to the calculation of the expected size of a shell of radius r in trees with volume V .

Now it is easy to show that the recurrence rule\nbr\u03bb [s2 ] reads:\nfor E\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nbr\u03bb [s2 ] = \u03bb b\nE\ng \u2032 (G(\u03bb))Er\u22121\n[s2 ] + \u03bb gb\u2032\u2032 (G(\u03bb)) (Er\u22121\n[s])2\n\nThus for 2 < \u03b2 < 3 the second moment is found to read\n\nhs2r iV \u2243 k2 (\u03b2)(r \u2212 1) V \u03bd+1/(\u03b2\u22121)\nwhere k2 (\u03b2) is some function of \u03b2 only.\n\u03bb\nbr\u03bb [sn ] we find, as a general rule, that the single Er\u22121\nFor all higher moments E\n[sn ] on the right hand side is multiplied\n\u03bb\nby \u03bbb\ng \u2032 (G(\u03bb)) while the products of k Er\u22121\n[*] are multiplied by \u03bbb\ng (k) (G(\u03bb)). Moreover the equations for Er\u03bb [O] are the\n\n\fb \u03bb [O] with b\nsame as those for E\ng(*) substituted by g(*). Therefore we obtain for all higher moments, up to the leading\nr\nterms in the \u03bb \u2192 1 limit,\nb \u03bb [sn ] \u2243 \u03bb gb\u2032 (G(\u03bb))E \u03bb [sn ] + . . .\nE\nr\nr\u22121\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nEr\u03bb [sn ] \u2243 \u03bb g \u2032 (G(\u03bb))Er\u22121\n[sn ] + \u03bb g (n) (G(\u03bb))Er\u22121\n[s]n + . . .\n\nThis entails the final result\n\n(27)\n\nhsnr iV \u2243 kn (\u03b2)(r \u2212 1)V \u03bd+(n\u22121)/(\u03b2\u22121)\nwhich is compatible with a scaling form for the sr probability just given by a finite-size scaling of the one found in\nsection III A, that is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr dc\ns\nPbr (s, V )\n1\nb\nPr (s|V ) =\n\u2243 dc \u22121 q dc \u22121 ,\nr\nr\nV\nPb(V )\n\nwhere dc is the already known local connectivity dimension\ndc =\n\n\u03b2\u22121\n\u03b2\u22122\n\nand the function q(x, y) is such that\nZ\n\nxn q(x, y)dx \u2243 y (\u03b2\u22122\u2212n)/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\nSimilarly it is possible to calculate the finite volume moments of the volume vr (o) which read:\nhvrn iV \u223c rn+1 V (n+2\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u22121)\n\n(28)\n\nThe proper scaling compatible with this result is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nv r dc\n1\nb\nPr (v|V ) \u2243 dc p dc ,\nr\nr\nV\n\n(29)\n\nif the moments of the scaling function p(x, y) behave as\nZ\nxn p(x, y)dx \u2243 y (\u03b2\u22122\u2212n)/(\u03b2\u22121)\nScaling (29) agrees with numerical simulations as shown in figure 2. For several different values of r and V , we\nbuilt 720 trees and calculated the volume v of radius r balls around 1000 (for each tree) randomly chosen nodes. Thus\ndifferent \"experimental\" probability distributions are found; we considered the integrated probability Qr (v|V ) =\nP\nb\nv \u2032 \u2264v Pr (v|V ) and plotted the values of v corresponding to Qr (v|V ) = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9; (after the proper\nrescaling by rdc ) versus rdc /V . For everyone of the six values of Qr (v|V ), the points corresponding to different values\nof r and V fall roughly on a curve, apart from statistical errors (fluctuations are expecially large for Qr (v|V ) = 0.9,\ndue to the long power-law tail of Pbr (v|V )), so that the form (29) of the probability scaling is supported.\nC.\n\nProbability of the average surface\n\nIn the bounded coordination case we were able to prove the auto-averaging property for every local observable: the\ngraph average O is non-fluctuating on infinite trees and coincides with the expectation value hOi in the branching\nprocess around the origin [9, 16]. This implies immediately that local and average connectivity dimensions coincide.\nIn the scale-free case the situation is more involved because many relevant expectation values do not even exist on\ninfinite trees, so that we cannot prove the auto-averaging property in the same way. Thus, to determine the average\nconnectivity dimension d \u0304c we will try to directly investigate the probability distribution of the average surface sr in\nthe large r limit. In particular, we look for a scaling form of the type\n\u0012\n\u0013\ns\n1\nPr[sr = s] \u2243 d \u0304 \u22121 f d \u0304 \u22121\nr c\nr c\n\n\f\u03b2 = 8/3,\n\ndc = 5/2,\n\nintegrated probability: 10% 20% 40% 60% 80% 90%\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n1000000\n2000000\n4000000\n8000000\n\n\u22122\n\nr dc /V\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nv/r dc\nFIG. 2: Group of symbols of the same color (online version) or shade of gray (printed version) correspond to all possible\ncombinations of r = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (using the same symbol) and V = 1, 2, 4, 8 * 106 (using different symbols as explained in\nthe legend).\n\nA very close approach is possible also for the average volume vr , but it is more involved and will not be reported here.\nThe results of the previous section, together with equation (20), allow us to calculate only the first moment of such\nprobability distribution. We now reconstruct it (at least its scaling form) through the calculation of higher moments.\nThis can be done by introducing Sr , defined as the sum of sr (x) over all nodes x of a tree:\nX\nSr =\nsr (x)\nx\u2208T\n\nThen on a finite-sized tree, the average surface sr , is given by\nsr =\n\nSr\nV\n\nand its (finite volume) moments are simply obtained\nh(sr )n iV =\n\nhSrn iV\nVn\n\nThe recursive nature of the trees allows us again to find the composition rule for Sr in terms of the values of Sr,j\nand the local surface sk,j (with k < r) relative to j\u2212th branch around the root o.

The quantity hh\u03c62x ii is given by a normalized Gaussian integral over\nall variables \u03c6y , y \u2208 G; if we perform all integrations except the one over \u03c6x we are left with a last integral which is\nalso Gaussian and normalized, thanks to the self-reproducing property of Gaussian integrals. Therefore we can define\nthe effective squared mass \u03bc(x) from the width of this last integral:\nr\nZ\n2\n1\n\u03bc(x)\n2\nhh\u03c6x ii =\nd\u03c6x \u03c62x e\u2212\u03bc(x)\u03c6x /2 =\n2\u03c0\n2\u03bc(x)\nOn a tree produced by a branching process the rules of Gaussian integration allow us to express the effective squared\nmass of the root as a function of those of the branches [16].\nX\n\n\u03bc(x) = \u03bc0 +\n\ny branches\nof x\n\n\u03bc(y)\n1 + \u03bc(y)\n\n(34)\n\nSimilarly the effective squared mass of a branch can be expressed as a function of those if its sub-branches, in a\nrecursive way. Since the recursion rule for \u03bc(x) is highly nontrivial we are not able to find directly its probability\ndistribution or its moments; instead we expand \u03bc(x) in powers of \u03bc0 and we consider the coefficients Vn\n\u03bc(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n+1 Vn (x)\u03bcn0\n\nn=1\n\nSubstituting this expansion in equation (34), recursion rules for the cofficients are obtained:\nX\nV1 (x) = 1 +\nV1 (y)\nV2 (x) =\n\nX\n\ny branches\nof x\n\ny branches\nof x\n\ni\nh\nV2 (y) + V1 (y)2\n\nand, in general\nVn (x) = \u03b4n,1 +\n\nX\n\ny branches\nof x\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nVn (y) + Fn (V1 (y), V2 (y), . . . , Vn\u22121 (y))\n\n\fwhere Fn is explicitly given in appendix B. The important feature which allows the calculation of Vn moments is\nthat the expression of Vn (x) is linear in the Vn (y).\nClearly V1 is just the volume V so that\nhV1 iV = V\n\nhV1n iV = V n\n\nand\n\nb V [*], E\nb \u03bb [*],\nNow we need the averages hVn iV for n \u2265 2.

If the\nproper scaling form of the surface and volume generating functions are substituted in their recursion rules, differential\nequations are obtained by consistency requirements. The solutions are the Laplace transform of the scaled surface\nand volume probability distributions. For \u03b2 > 3 both Laplace transforms can be calculated, while for 2 < \u03b2 < 3 only\nthe surface probability Laplace transform and the asymptotic behavior of the volume one can be obtained.\n1.\n\n\u03b2>3\n\nWhen \u03b2 > 3, dc is equal to 2 and we can write gr (\u03bb) as\n\nwith the condition\n\n\u0001\na(u)\na\u2217 (u)\ngr e\u2212u/r = 1 \u2212\n+ * * * + \u03b2\u22122 + * * *\nr\nr\na\u2032 (0) = 1\n\na(0) = 0 ,\n\n(A1)\n\n(A2)\n\nthat follows from gr (1) = gr\u2032 (1) = 1 and\na\u2217 (u) \u2243 c\u2217 u\u03b2\u22121\n\nfor u \u2192 0\n\n(A3)\n\nderived from equation (17).

The analytic term \u03c6(x)\nis the same as in the bounded case; the singular term \u03c6\u2217 (x), even if it is suppressed by powers of r, is essential\nin order to reproduce the power-law tail. The functions a(u) and a\u2217 (u) are determined by inserting equation (A1)\nin the recurrence (15), and equating the coefficients of the corresponding powers of r. Thus two coupled differential\nequations are obtained (see ref. [9] for details on the method in the case of bounded trees, when only a(u) is required):\nua\u2032 (u) = a(u) \u2212 c2 a(u)2\n\nua\u2032\u2217 (u) = (\u03b2 \u2212 2)a\u2217 (u) \u2212 2c2 a(u)a\u2217 (u) + c\u2217 a(u)\u03b2\u22121\nThe solution of the former, obtained with the use of the initial condition (A2), reads\na(u) =\n\nu\n1 + c2 u\n\nwhile the general solution of the latter reads\na\u2217 (u) =\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nc\u2217\nk\n1\n\u2212\nu\u03b2\u22122\nc2 (\u03b2 \u2212 4)\n(1 + c2 u)2\n(1 + c2 u)\u03b2\u22122\n\n\fThe value of k is found by comparison with the condition (A3) and turns out to be k = 1. The inverse Laplace\ntransforms \u03c6(x) of a\u2032 (u) is\n\u03c6(x) =\n\nx \u2212x/c2\ne\nc22\n\nwhile only the asymptotic x \u2192 \u221e behavior of \u03c6\u2217 (x) can be explicitly calculated:\n\u03c6\u2217 (x) \u2243 A x\u2212(\u03b2\u22121)\nTherefore, even if the contribution of \u03c6\u2217 (x) in equation (A4) is suppressed by powers of r, it is the most important\none for large x because of its power-law tail compared with the exponential one of \u03c6(x). Moreover, if \u03b2 > 4 there\nare other lower order corrections before the singular one; however since their contribution in the Laplace transform\nGsr (exp(u/r)) is analytic for u \u2192 0, they are exponentially vanishing for large s/r. The large s tail is therefore due to\nthe singular term.\nSimilar calculations can also be done for the volume probability. The first step consists in writing the expansion of\nhr (\u03bb) with the proper scaling:\nhr e\u2212\u03be/r\nwith the condition\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n=1\u2212\n\nb\u2217 (\u03be)\nb(\u03be)\n+ * * * + \u03b2\u22122 + * * *\nr\nr\n\nb(0) = 0 ,\n\nb\u2032 (0) = 1\n\n(A5)\n\n(A6)\n\nthat comes from hr (1) = 1 and h\u2032r (1) = r and\nb\u2217 (\u03be) \u2243\n\nc\u2217 \u03b2\u22121\nu\n\u03b2\n\n(A7)\n\nderived from equation (17). Inserting equation (A5) in the recurrence for hr (\u03bb) (equation (16)) and equating the\ncoefficients of corresponding powers of r, we obtain:\n2\u03beb\u2032 (\u03be) = b(\u03be) \u2212 c2 b(\u03be)2 + \u03be\n\n2\u03beb\u2032\u2217 (\u03be) = (\u03b2 \u2212 2)b\u2217 (\u03be) \u2212 2c2 b(\u03be)b\u2217 (\u03be) + c\u2217 b(\u03be)\u03b2\u22121\nTheir solutions, imposing the conditions (A6) and (A7), can be found to read:\nr\np\n\u03be\nb(\u03be) =\ntanh c2 \u03be\nc2\n!\u03b2 \"\n\u0001#\nr\n\u221a\np\nc\u2217\n\u03be\n\u03b2 \u2212 2 2 F1 1, \u03b2/2; 1 + \u03b2/2; (tanh c2 \u03be)2\n\u221a\ntanh c2 \u03be\nb\u2217 (\u03be) =\n1\u2212\n2\u03be\nc2\n\u03b2\n(cosh c2 \u03be)2\nwhere 2 F1 (a, b; c; z) is the hyper-geometric function; in our case it can also be written as:\n2 F1 (1, b; 1 + b; z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nb\nzn\nb\n+\nn\nn=0\n\nThe volume probability Pr[vr (o) = v] and its generating function Gvr (\u03bb) now can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nl\u2217 (\u03be)\nv \u2212\u03be/r 2\n= l(\u03be) 1 + . . . \u2212 \u03b2\u22123 + . . .\nGr e\nr\n\u0010v\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\nv\nPr[vr (o) = v] = 2 \u03a6 2 + . . . + \u03b2\u22121 \u03a6\u2217 2 + . . .\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere \u03a6(x) and \u03a6\u2217 (x) are the inverse Laplace transforms of l(\u03be) and l(\u03be)l\u2217 (\u03be), respectively.
