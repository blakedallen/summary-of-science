Introduction\nPair-production supernovae (PPSNe) are the uniquely calculable result of nonrotating\nstars that end their lives in the 140 \u2212 260 M\u2299 mass range (Heger & Woosley 2002,\nhereafter HW02). Their collapse and explosion result from an instability that generally\noccurs whenever the central temperature and density of star moves within a well-defined\nregime (Barkat, Rakavy, & Sack 1967). While this instability arises irrespective of the\nmetallicity of the progenitor star, PPSNe are in expected only in primordial environment,\nand there are three main reasons for this association.\nFirstly, in the present metal-rich universe, it appears that stars this large are never\nassembled, as supported by a wide range of observations. Figer (2005) carried out a\ndetailed study of the Z \u2248 Z\u2299 Arches cluster, which is large (M\u22c6 > 104 M\u2299 ), young (\u03c4\n= 2.0 - 2.5 Myrs), and at a well-determined distance, making it ideal for such studies.\nNo stars more massive than 130 M\u2299 were found, although more than 18 were expected.\nA similar \u2248 150 M\u2299 limit was found in the lower metallicity cluster R136 in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (Weidener & Kroupa 2003), and from a grab-bag of clusters compiled\nby Oey & Clarke (2005).\nHowever, there are good theoretical reasons to believe that the situation may have\nbeen very different under primordial conditions. In this case the primary coolant at low\ntemperatures is molecular hydrogen, which starts to be populated according to local\n1\n\n\f2\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) at a typical density and temperature of \u2248 104 cm\u22123\nand 100 K. As the Jeans mass under these conditions is \u2248 103 M\u2299 the fragmentation of\nprimordial molecular clouds may have been biased towards the formation of stars with\nvery high masses (Nakamura & Umemura 1999; Abel Bryan & Norman 2000, Schneider\net al. 2002; Tan & McKee 2004).\nFinally, as very massive, radiatively supported stars are only loosely bound they tend\nto drive large winds. However, these winds are primarily line-driven and scale with metallicity as Z 1/2 or faster (Kudritzki 2000; Vink et al. 2001; Kudritzki 2002). As long as\nanother mechanism did not act to generate significant mass loss in primordial stars (e.g.\nSmith & Owocki 2006) this raises the real possibility that they may have not only been\nborn, but have ended the lives in the mass range necessary to drive PPSNe.\nThis conference proceeding summarizes both the underlying physics and the prospects\nfor observation of these most powerful of astrophysical explosions, and it is structured as\nfollows: In \u00a72 I describe the pair-production instability in detail, and how it eventually\nleads to stellar disruption. In \u00a73 I discuss the post-explosion physics of these objects, and\nhow it effects their luminosity and temperature evolution. In \u00a74 I discuss the optical lightcurves of PPSNe, and contrast them with lightcuves of SNe Type-II and Ia. \u00a75 discusses\nthe redshift evolution of metal-free stars, and its implications for PPSN environments.\nIn \u00a76 these estimates are used to determine the feasibility of present and future PPSN.\nIn \u00a77 and \u00a78 I discuss the likely distribution of the descendents of metal-free stars in the\nGalaxy, and I close with a short summary in \u00a79.\n\n2. Physics of Pair-Production Supernovae\nThe instability that leads to the formation of PPSNe was first identified by Barkat,\nRakavy, & Sack (1967), who carried out a detailed analysis of the relevant equation\nof state for very massive stars near the end of their lifetimes. These results are shown\nin Figure 1. In hydrostatic balance p \u221d M 2/3 \u03c14/3 , which means that if the adiabatic\ncoefficient softens to below \u03b3 = 4/3, the star will become unstable to runaway collapse.\nFigure 1 shows that such a collapse occurs for stars with central temperatures from 109\nto 3 \u00d7 109 , and central densities less than 5 \u00d7 105 g cm\u22121 . This region is bounded by three\nlimits. Below the low-temperature boundary on the left, most of the central pressure is\nprovided by the radiation field, such that \u03b3 \u2248 4/3. As the temperature increases, photon\nenergies rise to the point that electron-positron pairs begin to be made, removing energy\nfrom the radiation field and softening \u03b3 below the critical value. The high-density end\nof this region, on the other hand, is bounded by degeneracy pressure, which provides\nsufficient support to halt collapse at high densities. Finally, at the high temperature\nboundary of the pair-instability regime, the energy consumed in creating the rest mass\nbecomes less significant, and \u03b3 remains above 4/3.\nAs massive stars are very loosely bound, their evolution is somewhat more complicated\nthat their lower mass counterparts, and thus requires more detailed numerical modeling.\nAs stars with masses above 140 M\u2299 collapse, their central temperature and density\nquickly increases, moving right through the unstable regime and starting explosive burning in the carbon-oxygen core. This explosive burning takes place in an environment\nin which there are very few excess neutrons, which results in a large deficiency in the\nnumber of nuclei with odd charge above 14 N. Thus elements such as Na, Al, and P are\nalmost 2 orders of magnitude less abundant than neighboring element with even charge\nsuch as Ne, Mg, and Si. This strong \"odd-even effect\" is a very general feature that is\nunavoidable in a model of the nucleosynthetic products of PPSNe (HW02).\nModels of the kinematics of PPSNe are similarly robust. For stars with initial masses\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Original plot from Barkat, Rakavy, & Sack (1967) showing the range of central\ntemperatures and densities at which the equation of state softens below the \u03b3 = 4/3 value\nrequired for stability. The solid lines give an early estimate of the evolution of a star with a 40\nM\u2299 oxygen core near the end of its life. Finally the region on the right shows the temperature\nand density region relevant in usual core-collapse supernovae.\n\nmore than about 140 M\u2299 , the energy released during explosive burning is sufficient to\ncompletely disrupt the star, resulting in a PPSN. This complete disruption means that\nwhile the evolution of these stars is somewhat more complex than lower mass stars, the\nexplosion mechanism driving the resulting supernovae is far simpler. There are no issues\nof fallback, mass-cut, or neutrino heating, and in the nonrotating case, the results are\nuniquely calculable.\nA shock moves outward from the edge of the core, initiating the supernova outburst\nwhen it reaches the stellar surface. Just above the 140 M\u2299 limit, weak silicon burning\noccurs and only trace amounts of radioactive 56 Ni are produced and it is this 56 Ni that\npowers the late-time supernova light curves. The amount of 56 Ni produced increases in\nlarger progenitors, and in 260 M\u2299 progenitors up to 50 M\u2299 may be synthesized, \u2248 100\ntimes more than in a typical Type Ia supernova. For stars with masses above 260 M\u2299 ,\nhowever, the onset of photodisintegration in the center imposes an additional instability\nthat collapses most of the star into a black hole (Bond, Arnett & Carr 1984; HW02;\nFryer, Woosley, & Heger 2001).\nPair-production supernovae are among most powerful thermonuclear explosions in the\nuniverse, with a total energies ranging from 3 \u00d7 1051 ergs for a 140 M\u2299 star (64 helium\nM\u2299 core) to almost 100 \u00d7 1051 ergs for a 260 M\u2299 star (133 M\u2299 helium core; HW02). In\nScannapieco et al. (2005, hereafter S05), we used the implicit hydrodynamical code KE-\n\n\f4\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\nTable 1.

KEPLER implements gray diffusive radiation transport\nwith approximate deposition of energy by gamma rays from radioactive decay of 56 Ni\nand 56 Co (Eastman et al. 1993), and the light curves obtained can only be followed as\nlong as there is a reasonably well-defined photosphere.\nA supernova can be bright either because it makes a lot of radioactive 56 Ni (as in\nType Ia supernovae) or because it has a large low density envelope and large radius\n(as in bright Type II supernovae). More radioactivity gives more energy at late times,\nwhile a larger initial radius results in a higher luminosity at early times. Here, the most\nimportant factors in determining the resulting light curves are the mass of the progenitor\nstar and the efficiency of dredge-up of carbon from the core into the hydrogen envelope\nduring or at the end of central helium burning. The specifics of the physical process\nencountered here are unique to primordial stars. Lacking initial metals, they have to\nproduce the material for the CNO cycle themselves, through the synthesis of 12 C by the\ntriple-alpha process. Just enough 12 C is produced to initiate the CNO cycle and bring\nit into equilibrium: a mass fraction of 10\u22129 when central hydrogen burning starts, and a\nmass fraction \u223c 10\u22127 during hydrogen-shell burning.\nAt these low values, the entropy in the hydrogen shell remains barely above that of\nthe core, and the steep entropy gradient at the upper edge of the helium core that is\ntypical for metal-enriched helium-burning stars is absent. This means that, during helium\nburning the central convection zone can get close, nip at, or even penetrate the hydrogenrich layers. Once such mixing of high-temperature hydrogen and carbon occurs, the two\ncomponents burn violently, and even without this rapid reaction, the hydrogen burning\nin the CNO cycle increases proportionately to the additional carbon. Thus mixing of\nmaterial from the helium-burning core, which has a carbon abundance of order unity,\nis able to raise the energy generation rate in the hydrogen-burning shell by orders of\nmagnitude over its intrinsic value.\nThis mixing has two major effects on the PPSN progenitor: first, it increases the\nopacity and energy generation in the envelope, leading to a red-giant structure for the\npresupernova star, in which the radius increases by over an order of magnitude. Second, it decreases the mass of the He core, consequently leading to a smaller mass of\n56\nNi being synthesized and a smaller explosion energy. The former effect increases the\nluminosity of the supernova, at early times, while the latter effect can weaken it, and\nin S05 we accounted for these uncertainties by employing different values of convective\novershooting.\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. Luminosities (top row), effective temperatures (center row), and photospheric radii\n(bottom row) of PPSNe for ten different representative models. Each sets of panels are labeled\nby the total mass of the progenitor star, and models with weak (dashed), intermediate (solid)\nand strong (dot-dashed) convective overshoot are shown. Finally, the dotted lines in the central\npanels correspond to model 200-S2. See text and Table 1 for details.\n\nA suite of representative models was chosen to address the expected range of presupernova models - from blue supergiant progenitors with little or no mixing to well-mixed\nred hypergiants, which can have pre-SN radii of 20 AU or more. These models are summarized in Table 1, in which the names refer to the mass of the progenitor star (in units\nof M\u2299 ) and the weak (W), intermediate (I), or strong (S) level of of convective overshoot. Here we show the final mass in helium, nitrogen, nickel, the radius just before the\nexplosion, and the kinetic energy of the explosion in units of 1051 ergs.\n\n3. Luminosity and Temperature Evolution\nThe KEPLER code can be used to compute approximate light curves and has been\nvalidated both against much more complex and realistic codes such as EDDINGTON\nand observations of a prototypical Type II-P supernova, SN 1969L (Weaver and Woosley\n1980; Eastman et al 1994), although its main deficiency is that it is a single temperature\ncode using flux-limited radiative diffusion. The evolution of the luminosities, effective\ntemperatures, and photospheric radii for the models in Table 1, are shown in Figure 2.\n\n\f6\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nAs the shock moves toward the low-density stellar surface, its energy is deposited into\nprogressively smaller amounts of matter. This results in high velocities and temperatures\nwhen the shock reaches the stellar surface, causing a pulse of ultraviolet radiation with\na characteristic timescale of a few minutes. This \"breakout\" phase is by far the most\nluminous and bluest phase of the PPSN burst, but its very short duration makes it\ndifficult to use in observational searches. In fact, the analog of this phase in conventional\nSNe has so far only been indirectly detected in SN 1987A (e.g. Hamuy et al. 1988;\nCatchpole et al. 1988).\nFollowing breakout, the star expands with Rphot initially proportional to time. Though\na small fraction of the outer mass may move much faster, the characteristic velocity of the\nphotosphere during this phase is a modest v = (2KE/M )1/2 \u223c (1053 ergs/200 M\u2299)1/2 \u223c\n5000 km/s, because of the very large mass participating in the explosion. During the\nexpansion, the radiation-dominated ejecta cool adiabatically, with T approximately proportional to R\u22121 , with an additional energy input from the decay of 56 Ni (if a significant mass was synthesized during the explosion) and hydrogen recombinations (when\nT \u2248 104 K). As the scale radius for this cooling is the radius of the progenitor, the temperatures and luminosities are substantially larger throughout this phase in the cases\nwith the strongest mixing.\nAfter \u2248 50 days, the energy input from 56 Co decay becomes larger than the remaining\nthermal energy and the energy deposited by 56 Co in deeper layers that were enriched in\n56\nNi can diffuse out. For stars that were compact to begin with, this can cause a delayed\nrise to the peak of the light curve. For stars with larger radii, the radioactivity just makes\na bright tail following the long plateau in emission from the expanding envelope. Eventually, even the slow-moving inner layers recombine and there is no longer a well-defined\nphotosphere. At this time the assumption of LTE breaks down, and more detailed radiative transfer calculations are required, which are beyond the scope of our S05 modeling.\nThe SN is fainter and redder during this phase, however, and thus is difficult to detect\nat cosmological distances in optical and near infrared (NIR) surveys.\n\n4. PPSNe Lightcurves\nIn S05, we calculated approximate PPSNe lightcurves, assuming a black body distribution with the color temperature equal to the effective temperature. Recall that the peak\nfrequency in this case occurs at a wavelength of 5100(Teff /10000K)\u22121 \u00c5. The resulting\nlight curves are shown in Figure 3 which gives the evolution of AB magnitudes at three\nrepresentative wavelengths: 5500 \u00c5, corresponding to the central wavelength of the Vband; 4400 \u00c5, corresponding to the B-band; and 3650 \u00c5, corresponding to the U-band.\nWe focus on blue wavelengths as it is features in these bands that will be redshifted into\nthe optical and NIR at cosmological distances. For comparison, we also include observed\nlight curves for a SN Type Ia (1994D as measured by Patat et al. 1996 and Cappellaro\net al. 1997) a SN Type II-P (1999em as observed by Elmhamdi et al. 2003), and the very\nbright Type II-L SN 1979C (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1981; Barbon et al. 1982).\nThe most striking feature from this comparison is that despite enormous kinetic energies of \u223c 50 \u00d7 1051 ergs, the peak optical luminosities of PPSNe are similar to those\nof other SNe, even falling below the Ia and II curves in many cases. This is because the\nhigher ejecta mass produces a large optical depth and most of the internal energy of the\ngas is converted into kinetic energy by adiabatic expansion. Furthermore, the colors of\nthe PPSN curves are not unlike those of more usual cases. In fact, pair-production supernovae spend most of their lives in the same temperature range as other SNe. Clearly,\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of light curves of a SN Type Ia, a SN Type II-P, a bright SN Type II-L,\nand PPSNe models with varying progenitor masses and levels of dredge-up. In all cases the solid\nlines are absolute V-band AB magnitudes, the dot-dashed lines are the absolute B-band AB\nmagnitudes, and the dashed lines are the absolute U-band AB magnitudes.\n\nthen, PPSNe will not be obviously distinguishable from their more usual counterparts\n\"at first glance.\"\nRather, distinguishing PPSNe will from other SNe will require multiple observations\nthat constrain the time evolution of these objects. In particular there are two key features\nthat are uniquely characteristic to PPSNe. The first of these is a dramatically extended\nintrinsic decay time, which is especially noticeable in the models with the strongest\nenrichment of CNO in the envelope. This is due to the long adiabatic cooling times of\nsupergiant progenitors, whose radii are \u223c 20 AU, but whose expansion velocities are\nsimilar or even less than those of other SNe. Second, PPSNe are the only objects that\nshow an extremely late rise at times > 100 days. This is due to energy released by the\ndecay of 56 Co, which unlike in the Type Ia case, takes months to dominate over the\ninternal energy imparted by the initial shock. In this case the feature is strongest in\nmodels with the least mixing and envelope enrichment during helium burning, as these\nhave the largest helium cores and consequently the largest 56 Ni masses.\n\n\f8\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nNote, however, that neither of these features is generically present in all PPSNe, and\nboth can be absent in smaller VMS that fail expand to large sizes through dredge-up\nand do not synthesize appreciable amounts of 56 Ni. In the 150-W case, for example, the\nluminosity decays monotonically on a relatively short time scale, producing a lightcurve\nsimilar to the comparison Type II curves. In fact this 150 M\u2299 SN shares many features\nwith its smaller-mass cousin: both are SNe from progenitors with radii \u223c 1013 cm and in\nboth 56 Ni plays a negligible role. In no case, however, do PPSNe look anything like SNe\nType Ia. In particular none of the pair-production models display the long exponential\ndecay seen in the Type Ia curves, and all PPSNe contain hydrogen lines, arising from\ntheir substantial envelopes.\n\n5. The Redshift Evolution of Metal-Free Stars\nPlanning searches for PPSNe not only depends on understanding their lightcurves,\nbut also the environments and redshifts at which they are most like to be located. In\nScannapieco, Schneider, & Ferrara, (2003; hereafter SSF03) we showed that cosmological\nenrichment is a local process, such that the transition from metal-free to Population\nII stars is heavily dependent on the efficiency with which metals where mixed into the\nintergalactic medium. This efficiency depends in turn on the kinetic energy input from\nPPSNe, which was parameterized by the \"energy input per unit primordial gas mass\"\nEgIII , defined as the product of the fraction of gas in each primordial object that is\nconverted into stars (f\u22c6III ), the number of PPSNe per unit mass of metal-free stars\nformed (N \u00b1 ), the average kinetic energy per supernova (Ekin ), and the fraction of the\ntotal kinetic energy channeled into the resulting galaxy outflow (fwind ).\nHere we focus on the later stage of metal-free star formation. Note that this is fundamentally different than star frormation taking place in very small \"minihalos\" at redshifts\n\u2248 25, which depends sensitively on the presence of initial H2 (e.g. O'Shea et al. 2005).\nIn small objects, molecular hydrogen is easily photodissociated by 11.2-13.6 eV photons,\nto which the universe is otherwise transparent. This means that the emission from the\nfirst stars quickly destroyed all avenues for cooling by molecular line emission (Dekel &\nRees 1987; Haiman, Rees, & Loeb 1997; Ciardi, Ferrara, & Abel 2000), which quickly\nraised the minimum virial temperature necessary to cool effectively to approximately 104\nK. Thus the majority of primordial star formation is likely to have occurred in objects\nabove this limit, who form their own H2 at high densities and are largely impervious to\nthe photodissociating background (Oh & Haiman 2002).\nIncorporating outflows into a detailed analytical model of such \"primordial galaxies\"\nleads to the approximate relation that, by mass, the fraction of the total star formation\nin metal-free stars at z = 4 is\nF\u22c6III (z = 4) \u223c 10\u22125 (EgIII )\u22121 ,\n\u00b1\n\n(5.1)\n\n51\n\nwhere, as above, E is in units of 10 ergs per M\u2299 of gas (see Figure 3 of SSF03 for\ndetails). Extrapolating the results in SSF03 to z = 0 gives\nF\u22c6III (z = 0) \u223c 10\u22125.5 (EgIII )\u22121 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThese fractions can be related to the underlying population of stars by adopting fiducial\nvalues of f\u22c6III = 0.1 for the star formation efficiency, which is consistent with the observed\nstar formation rate density at intermediate and high redshifts (Scannapieco, Ferrara, &\nMadau 2002), and fw = 0.3 for the wind efficiency, which is consistent with the dwarf\ngalaxy outflow simulations of Mori, Ferrara, & Madau (2002). Finally, we assume that\n1 pair-production SN occurs per 1000 solar masses of metal free stars. This gives F\u22c6III\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n9\n\nFigure 4. Number of PPSNe per square degree per unit redshift per year for a wide range of\nmodels. The solid and dashed curves assume Pop III star formation rate densities of 0.001 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 and 1% of the observed star formation rate density, respectively. The shaded region\ncovers the range of metal-free star formation rate density models considered in SSF03, with\nthe weakest feedback model (EgIII = 10\u22124 ) defining the upper end, and the strongest feedback\nmodel (EgIII = 10\u22122.5 ) defining the lower end. An extrapolation of these star formation rate\ndensities to z = 0 leads to the crosshatched region. In all SSF03 models the highest rates occur\nat redshifts 6 10. Finally, the starred point is the z = 15 estimate by Weinmann & Lilly (2005).\n\nvalues of 0.3(Ekin )\u22121 at z = 4 and 0.1(Ekin )\u22121 at z = 0, respectively. Or, in other words,\nfor typical energies of 30 \u00d7 1051 ergs per PPSNe, \u223c 1% of the star formation at z = 4\nand \u223c 0.3% of the star formation at z = 0 by mass should be in metal-free stars.\nIn Figure 4 we show estimates of the number of SNe per deg2 per dz per year over the\nwide range of models considered in SSF03, extrapolating to z = 0. In all cases we assume\nthat 1 PPSN forms per 1000 solar masses of metal-free stars, and for comparison we\nshow two simple estimates which we refer to further below. In the first simple model, we\nassume that metal-free star formation occurs at a constant rate density, which we take to\nbe \u03c1\u00b1 (z)0.001 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 , independent of redshift. In the second case, we assume\nthat at all redshifts metal-free stars form at 1% of the observed total star formation\n\u22121\nrate density, which we model as log10 [\u03c1obs\nMpc\u22123 ] = \u22122.1 + 3.9 log10 (1 +\n\u22c6 (z)/ M\u2299 yr\n2\nz) \u2212 3.0 [log10 (1 + z)] , a simple fit to the most recent measurements (Giavalisco et al.\n2004; Bouwens et al. 2004). For both star formation models we again assume that 1\npair-production SN occurs per 1000 solar masses of metal free stars.\nNote that for the full range of models in Figure 4, metal-free star formation naturally\noccurs in the smallest galaxies, which are just large enough to overcome the thermal\npressure of the ionized IGM, but small enough not to be clustered near areas of previous star formation (SSF03). In our adopted cosmology, for a temperature of 104 K,\nthe minimum virial mass is 3 \u00d7 109 (1 + z)\u22123/2 M\u2299 with a corresponding gas mass of\n\n\f10\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n5 \u00d7 108 (1 + z)\u22123/2 M\u2299 . This means the total stellar mass of primordial objects is likely\nto be around M\u22c6 \u2248 108 M\u2299 (1 + z)\u22123/2 , many orders of magnitude below L\u22c6 galaxies.\nThus in general blank-field surveys should be the best method for searching for PPSNe,\nas catalogs of likely host galaxies would be extremely difficult to construct.\nNevertheless, as VMS shine so brightly, a direct search for primordial host galaxies is\nnot a hopeless endeavor. In particularly the lack of dust in these objects and the large\nnumber of ionizing photons from massive metal-free stars leads naturally to a greatly\nenhanced Lyman alpha luminosity. Following SSF03 this can be estimated as\nL\u03b1 = cL (1 \u2212 fesc )Q(H)M\u22c6 ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere cL \u2261 1.04 \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs, fesc is the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the\ngalaxy, which is likely to be . 0.2 (see Ciardi, Bianchi, & Ferrara 2002 and references\ntherein), and the ionizing photon rate Q(H) can be estimated as \u2248 1048 s\u22121 M\u2299 \u22121\n(Schaerer 2002). This gives a value of L\u03b1 \u223c 1045 (1 + z)\u22123/2 ergs s\u22121 which, if observed\nin a typical 1000 \u00c5 wide broad band corresponds to an absolute AB mag \u223c \u221223 +\n3.8 log(1 + z), much brighter than the PPSNe themselves. However this flux would be\nspread out over many pixels and be more difficult to observe against the sky than the\npoint-like PPSNe emission. For further details on the detectability of metal-free stars\nthough Lyman-alpha observations, the reader is referred to SSF03.\n\n6. Pair-Production Supernovae in Cosmological Surveys\nFrom the models developed above, it is relatively straightforward to relate the star formation history of VMS to the resulting number of observable pair-production supernova.\nIn this section and below we adopt cosmological parameters of h = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b\n= 0.7, and \u03a9b = 0.045, where h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s\u22121 and \u03a9m ,\n\u03a9\u039b , and \u03a9b are the total matter, vacuum, and bayonic densities in units of the critical\ndensity (e.g. Spergel et al. 2003).\nHere we focus on three PPSN light curves, which bracket the range of possibilities:\nthe faintest of all our models, 150-W, in which there is neither significant dredge-up nor\n56\nNi production; an intermediate model, 200-I, in which some dredge-up occurred, but\n5.1 M\u2299 of 56 Ni were formed; and the model with the brightest lightcurves, 250-S, in\nwhich substantial dredge-up leads to an enormous initial radius of over 20 A.U., and the\nproduction of 24.5 M\u2299 of 56 Ni causes an extended late-time period of high luminosity.\nNote that we do not address the possibility of extinction by dust, which amounts to\nassuming that pristine regions remain dust-free thought the lifetime of the very massive\nPPSN progenitors stars.\nFor any given PPSN model, we can calculate t(\u03bb, F\u03bdmin , z) the total time the observed\nflux at the wavelength \u03bb from a SN at the redshift z is greater than the magnitude limit\nassociated with the specific flux F\u03bdmin . The total number of PPSNe shining at any given\ntime with fluxes above F\u03bdmin , per square degree per unit redshift is then given by the\nproduct of the volume element, the (time-dilated) PPSN rate density, and the time a\ngiven PPSN is visible, that is\ndNdeg2\ndr \u03c1\u00b1 (z)\n(\u03bb, F\u03bdmin , z) = [r(z) sin(1deg)]2\nt(\u03bb, F\u03bdmin , z),\ndz\ndz 1 + z\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere the rate density \u03c1\u00b1 (z) is the number of PPSNe per unit time per comoving volume\nas a function of redshift.\nThe resulting observed PPSNe counts for these models are given in Figure 5 for two\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n11\n\nFigure 5. Number of PPSNe per square degree per unit redshift above a given I-band magnitude, assuming 0.001 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (solid lines) or 1% of the observed star formation rate\ndensity (dashed lines). The IAB = 26 cut taken in the upper rows approximately corresponds\nto the magnitude limit of the Institute for Astronomy Deep Survey which covered 2.5 deg2 (as\nshown by the dotted lines) from September 2001 to April 2002. The IAB = 27 limit in the\nbottom panel corresponds to that of the ongoing COSMOS survey, which will survey an area\nof 2 deg2 (again indicated by the dotted lines). Note however, that the COSMOS survey itself\nis primarily focused on large-scale structure issues and will not be able to find PPSNe, as each\npointing is visited only once.\n\nlimiting magnitudes. In the upper panels, we take a IAB = 26 magnitude limit, appropriate for the Institute for Astronomy (IfA) Deep Survey (Barris et al. 2004), a ground-based\nsurvey that covered a total of 2.5 deg2 from September 2001 to April 2002. As we are\nfocused on lower-redshift observations, we only plot estimated counts for the two simple\nrate density models described in \u00a75, rather than the more detailed (but higher redshift)\nSSF03 models.\nFrom this figure we see that existing data sets, if properly analyzed, are easily able to\nplace useful constraints on PPSN formation at low redshifts. Given a typical model like\n200-I for example, the already realized IfA survey can be used to place a constraint of\n. 1% of the total star formation rate density out to a redshift \u2248 1. Similarly, extreme\nmodels such as 250-S can be probed out to redshifts \u2248 2, all within the context of a recent\nSN search driven by completely different science goals. Note however that these limits\nare strongly dependent on significant mixing in the SN progenitor or the production of\n56\nNi, and thus models such as 150-W remain largely unconstrained by the IfA survey.\nIn the bottom panels of Figure 5 we consider a limiting magnitude of IAB = 27,\nappropriate for the COSMOS survey\u2020, a project that covers 2 deg2 using the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys on HST. Raising the limiting magnitude from IAB = 26 to IAB = 27\n\u2020 see http://www.astro.caltech.edu/\u223ccosmos/\n\n\f12\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nFigure 6. Number of PPSNe per square degree per unit redshift above a fixed AB magnitude,\nwith limits appropriate for three possible surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope. Curves\nare as in Figure 5, while the shaded regions are predictions from the full range of SSF03 models\ndescribed in \u00a75. Top: The 31.1 AB magnitude limit taken in these panels corresponds to the 10\n\u03c3 detection limit for a 106 sec integration with at 2\u03bcm with the NIRCam instrument. While this\nwould be able to probe SN extremely deeply, it would only cover a 9.8 arcmin2 patch of the sky,\ncorresponding to the dotted lines. No detections would be expected in this small area. Center:\nThe 28.8 AB magnitude 2\u03bcm limit taken in these panels corresponds to the 10 \u03c3 detection limit\nfor a 104 second integration with NIRCam. In 106 seconds, such measurements could be taken\nat roughly 100 pointings, covering a 0.3 deg2 area, corresponding to the dotted lines. In this case\n\u223c 10 PPSNe like 150W or 200I would be detectable out to z \u2248 6, while up to \u223c 30 PPSNe like\n250S would be detectable out to z \u2248 10. Bottom: The 28.8 AB magnitude 3.6\u03bc limit taken in\nthese panels again corresponds to 10 \u03c3 detections for a 104 second NIRCam integration. Moving\nto a longer wavelength results in a significant boost to both the number of detectable PPSNe\nand the maximum redshift at which they can be observed.\n\nhas the primary effect of extending the sensitivity out to slightly higher redshifts. This\npushes the probed range from z . 1 to z . 1.5 in the 200-I case and from z . 2 to z . 3\nin the 250-S case. Again this is all in the context of an ongoing survey. Even with this\nfainter limiting magnitude, however, low-luminosity PPSNe like 150-W are extremely\ndifficult to find, and remain largely unconstrained.\nThis shortcoming is easily overcome by moving to NIR wavelengths. In Figure 6 we\npresent for the first time similar limits computed for the James Webb Space Telecope\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n13\n\n(JWST),using both the simple models PopIII SFR density models shown in Figure 5\nas well as the full range of more detailed models acomputed in SSF03. With JWST,\ndNdeg2 /dz is dramatically increased with respect to ground-based searches. This is due\nto the fact that for the majority of their lifetimes, the effective temperatures of PPSNe are\njust above the \u2248 103.8 K recombination temperature of hydrogen, which corresponds to a\npeak black-body wavelength \u2248 8000 \u00c5. This means that for all but the lowest redshifts,\nthe majority of the emitted light is shifted substantially redward of the I-band, which\nis centered at 9000 \u00c5. Given the sensitivities described in Gardner et al. (2006), a 106\nsecond NIRCam at 2.0\u03bc integration would be able to see a PPSN out to z \u2248 15.\nIn fact, NIRCam will be so sensitive that using it to perform extremely long integrations\nwill not be the best way to search for PPSNe. Rather, the key issue will be covering enough\narea to find them at the rates expected from theoretical models. As a single NIRCam\npointing only covers 9.8 square arcminutes, any individual such field is not likely to host\na PPSN, even at such very faint magnitudes. Rather a much more efficient method is to\ncarry out a survey composed of roughly 100 pointings, each with a 104 second integration\ntime. In this case, \u223c 10 PPSNe like 150W or 200I would be detectable out to z \u2248 6, while\nup to \u223c 30 PPSNe like 250S would be detectable out to z \u2248 10. Furthermore, moving\nto slightly longer wavelengths, increases the high-redshift sensitivity much in the same\nway as carrying out longer integrations at a fixed band. Thus the expected number of\nPPSNe/deg2 /dz above an AB magnitude limit of 28.8 at 3.6\u03bcm is comparable to the\nnumber of PPSNe/deg2 /dz above an AB magnitude limit of 31.3 at 2.0\u03bcm.\nTaken together, these results imply that the optimal strategy for searching for PPSNe\nwith JWST will be to carry out a 2 or 3 band NIRCam survey (to obtain color information\non these objects), with an emphasis on longer wavelengths (to boost sensitivity), made up\nof \u2248 100 pointings with moderate integration times (to maximize sky coverage). Finally\nas most of the features in PPSNe lightcurves are on the 30-100 day scale, this field should\nbe revisited roughly once per 30 days \u00d7(1+z) \u2248 1 year, on three occasions. Although this\nwould require about 1-2 weeks of dedicated time each year, clearly this program could\nbe carried out in the context of a more general deep-field study, such as the present\nSupernova Cosmology Project in the context of the Great Observatories Origins Deep\nSurvey with HST.\n\n7. Modeling the Galactic Descendants of Metal-Free Stars\nA secondary method of searching for PPSN is the detection of their nucleosynthetic\nproducts in present day stars. However, interpretation of these abundances is complicated\nby the fact that searches for metal-poor stars are limited to the Galactic halo, where dust\nextinction and crowding are minimal. In fact, these analyses have already provided a\nnumber intriguing constraints on the enrichment history of the halo (Freeman & BlandHawthorn 2002; Beers & Christlieb 2005), including uncovering the presence of extremely\nheavy-element deficient stars (Christlieb et al. 2002; Frebel et al. 2005). Yet, it is still\nunclear how the observed population of halo stars is related to PopIII star formation\n(White & Springel 2000; Diemand, Madau, & Moore 2005).\nTo quantify this, in Scannapieco et al. (2006), we combined a high-resolution N-body\nsimulation of the formation of the Milky-Way with a semi-analytical model of metal\nenrichment similar to that in SSF03. Our N-body simulation was carried out with the\nGCD+ code (Kawata & Gibson 2003a), and it used a multi-resolution technique (Kawata &\nGibson 2003b) to achieve high-resolution within a 1 Mpc radius, while the outer regions\nexerting tidal forces were handled with lower resolution. In the high-resolution region,\nthe dark metter particle mass was Mvir = 7.8 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , compared to the final virial\n\n\f14\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nmass of Mvir = 7.7 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . The simulation data was output every 0.11 Gyr, and at\neach output, we use a friend-of-friends (FOF) group finder to identify the virialized DM\nhalos, with a linking parameter of b = 0.2. As in \u00a75 we then assumed star formation to\noccur in all halos with virial temperatures above the atomic cooling limit of 104 K, which\ncorresponds to a minimum mass of Mmin \u2261 3.0 \u00d7 109 (1 + z)\u22123/2 M\u2299 . This means that\neven at a very high redshift of 20, all the halos relevant to our study contained at least\n50 particles, and are well-identified by a FOF group finder.\nOur next step was to use this accretion history to identify two types of objects: i) halos\nthat collapsed out of primordial gas, which we identified as PopIII objects containing \"the\nfirst stars,\" and ii) halos that collapsed from gas that has been enriched purely by PopIII\nobjects, which we identified as second-generation objects objects containing \"the second\nstars.\" Following our approach in SSF03, we adopted a model of outflows as spherical\nshells expanding into the Hubble flow (Ostriker & McKee 1988) for both PopIII and\nPopII/I objects. These shells were assumed to be driven only by the internal hot gas\npressure and decelerated by accreting material and gravitational drag. The evolution of\neach such bubble was then completely determined by the mechanical energy imparted to\nthe outflow. In particular the only difference between PopIII and PopII/I outflows arises\nfrom the energy input per unit gas mass,\" EgIII,II .\nIn the PopII/I case, we calculated this assuming that 10% of the gas was converted\ninto stars, that 1051 ergs of kinetic energy input 300 M\u2299 of stars formed, and we assumed\nan overall wind efficiency fit to results of Mori, Ferrara, & Madau (2002) and Ferrara,\nPettini, & Shchekinov (2000). In the PopIII case, on the other hand, as there are no\ndirect constraints, we varied EgIII over a large range as in \u00a75. Finally, when outflows\nslowed down to the IGM sound speed, we assumed they fragmented and let them expand\nwith the Hubble flow. For further details, the reader is referred to Scannapieco et al.\n(2006).\n\n8. The Spatial Distribution of the Galactic Descendants of\nMetal-Free Stars\nFigure 7 demonstrates the positions of the first and second stars at different redshifts\nin the Lagrangian model with EgIII = 10\u22122 . At early times (z = 9.84), the first stars\nform close to the central density peak of the progenitor galaxy, due to the higher density\npeaks in this region. Second stars form in the halo in the neighborhood of first stars,\nbecause they condense from gas that is enriched by the material from the explosions of\nthe first stars. At a later time (z = 6.02), new first stars are still forming, but now on\nthe outer regions of the progenitor galaxy, because they are not yet affected by winds\nfrom the central region. The formation of the first and second stars is complete around\nz = 3, at which time the full region is enriched with metals. Also at this redshift, first\nand second stars start to be accreted into the assembling Galactic halo. This assembly\nis almost complete by z = 1, and thus the distribution at this redshift is similar to that\nat z = 0.\nIn Figure 8 we plot the radial mass density of first and second stars, as compared to\nthe dark matter distribution in our simulation. In computing these masses, we assume\nthat 10% of the gas mass in each halo is converted into stars and we intentionally make\nno attempt to account for mass loss due to stellar evolution. Furthermore, we plot only\nout to 250 kpc, which is 1/4 the size of the high-resolution region. Here we see that\nthe density profiles of first and second stars are similar to the total dark matter density\nprofile, although the second stars have a slightly shallower slope. As a result, the density\nof first stars at the center is 100 times higher than at the 8 kpc orbital radius of the\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n15\n\nFigure 7. Distributions of first and second stars (3rd and 4th columns) in a a 200 proper kpc3\nregion, at various redshifts, for a model with EgIII = 10\u22122 . For comparison, the 1st and 2nd\ncolumns show all the particles and all the particles that were ever within a halo with a virial\ntemperature above the atomic cooling limit, respectively.\n\n\f16\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nFigure 8. Radial profile of first (left column) and second stars (right column) at z = 0. In the\ntop row, the dotted lines give the overall dark matter profile of the galaxy, which is compared\nwith the radial density of first and second stars in models with EgIII = 10\u22122 (solid), EgIII = 10\u22123\n(short-dashed), and and EgIII = 10\u22124 (dot-dashed). The lower row shows the fraction of the\ntotal density in first and second stars, with symbols as in the upper panels. Note that this plot\ndoes not include any mass loss due to stellar evolution.\n\nsun. However, the important number for developing observational strategies for finding\nthe first stars is their relative density with respect to the field stars. While this is not\ndirectly computed in our simulation, the lower panels of Figure 8 show the local mass\ndensity of stars normalized by the local density of dark matter.\nAmazingly, the mass fraction contained in the first stars varies only very weakly with\nradius. Moving from 1 to 100 kpc in the EgIII = 10\u22124 model, for example, the fraction\nof the mass in first stars decreases only by a factor \u2248 4. Furthermore, increasing the\nefficiency of PopIII winds to EgIII = 10\u22122 has the effect of decreasing the fraction of first\nstars without strongly affecting their radial distribution.\nThis is both good and bad news for PPSNe models. First of all it means that observations of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo should be taken as directly constraining the\nproperties of primordial objects. Thus the lack of metal-free stars observed in the halo is\nlikely to imply a real lower mass limit in the metal free initial mass function (IMF) of at\n\n\fEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\n17\n\nleast 0.8 M\u2299 , the mass of a low-metallicity star with a lifetime comparable to the Hubble\ntime (Fagotto et al. 1994). In fact the \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299 pc\u22123 value for PopIII stars in the solar\nneighborhood we compute is so high as compared to the observed stellar mass density\nof 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 pc\u22123 (Preston, Shectman, & Beers 1991), that several primordial 0.8 M\u2299\nstars would have been observed even if f\u2217III were over an order of magnitude lower than\nthe 0.1 value we used to normalize our approach. This lends strong support to models of\nmetal free stars as biased to high masses.\nOn the other hand, it also means that the abundances we see in very metal poor stars\nshould be taken to constrain elements produced in the first stars. In particular, if a large\nfraction of PopIII star formation resulted in PPSNe, then then the strong odd-even effect\ndiscussed in \u00a72 should be measurable in in a subset of stars with [Fe/H] 6 \u22122. To date\nthese measurements have failed to uncover this signal. As discussed in Tumlinson (2006),\nthis does not rule out the presence of PPSNe, but it does argue strongly that a significant\nnumber of PopIII stars ended their lives as more usual core-collapse supernovae.\n\n9. Summary\nTheoretically, PPSNe are the simplest of all supernovae. Driven by a well-understood\ndynamical instability, and leading to complete stellar disruption, they are the uniquely\ncalculable result of nonrotating stars than end their lives in the 140 \u2212 260 M\u2299 mass range\n(Heger & Woosley 2002). The issue is only when and where such stars existed. In the\npresent, enriched, universe the observed upper mass limit of forming stars, and the rate of\nmass loss in O stars argue strongly against these objects. However, in the primordial highredshift universe things are likely to have been very different. The typical fragmentation\nmass under these conditions is \u2248 1000M\u2299 and stellar winds, at least of the line driven\ntype observed today, are expected to be negligible. This raises the real possibility that\nin the metal-free universe a large fraction of stars generated PPSNe.\nAs metal-enrichment is an intrinsically local process that proceeds over an extended\nredshift range, at each redshift, pockets of metal-free star formation are naturally confined\nto the lowest-mass galaxies, which are small enough not to be clustered near areas of\nprevious star formation. As such faint galaxies are difficult to detect and even more\ndifficult to confirm as metal-free, the hosts of PPSNe could easily be lurking at the limits\nof present-day galaxy surveys.\nIn S05 we showed that the most important factorsfor modeling PPSNe lightcurves\nare the mass of the progenitor star and the efficiency of dredge-up of carbon from the\ncore into the envelope. In general, increasing the mass leads to greater 56 Ni production,\nwhich boots the late time SN luminosity. Mixing, on the other hand, has two major\neffects: it leads to a red giant phase that increases the early-time SN luminosity and it\ndecreases the mass of the He core, consequently leading to a somewhat smaller mass of\n56\nNi. Despite these uncertainties, PPSNe in general can be characterized by: (1) peak\nmagnitudes that are brighter than Type II SNe and comparable or slightly brighter than\ntypical SNe Type Ia; (2) very long decay times \u223c 1 year, which result from the large\ninitial radii and large masses of material involved in the explosion; and (3) the presence\nof hydrogen lines, which are caused by the outer envelope.\nThe S05 lightcurves also allowed us to calculate the number of PPSNe detectable in\ncurrent and planned supernova searches. Here the long lifetimes help to keep a substantial\nnumber of PPSNe visible at any given time, meaning that ongoing SN searches should be\n<\nable to limit the contribution of VMS to \u223c\n1 % of the total star formation rate density\nout to a redshift of 2, unless both mixing and 56 Ni production are absent for all PPSNe.\nSuch constraints already place meaningful limits on the cosmological models.\n\n\f18\n\nEvan Scannapieco: Pair-Production Supernovae\n\nThe impact of future NIR searches is even more promising, as the majority of the\nPPSN light is emitted at restframe wavelengths longward of \u2248 8000 \u00c5. In particular\nJWST surveys with NIRCam have the potential to place fantastic constraints on PPSNe\nout to z \u2248 10. In this case the best approach will be a \u2248 0.3 deg2 survey made up\nof \u2248 100 NIRCam pointings with \u2248 104 sec integrations in two or three bands, with\nemphasis on the redder colors. Furthermore this field should be revisited with a cadence\nof roughly once per year on three occasions. Although this would require about 1-2 weeks\nof dedicated time each year, clearly this program could be carried out in the context of\na more general deep field study, with a much broader set of science goals.\nCloser to home, we have also studied the final distribution of the elements synthesized\nin primordial stars. Despite the large uncertainties involved, all models generically predict significant PopIII star formation in what is now the Galactic halo. Thus, if they have\nsufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed in initially primordial star\nclusters should be found in ongoing surveys for metal-poor halo stars. This is both good\nand bad news for PPSNe models. While it implies a real lower mass limit for the PopIII\nIMF of at least 0.8 M\u2299 , it also suggests that the lack of an odd-even effect in the observed abundance ratios of metal-poor stars should be taken as evidence that a significant\nnumber of PopIII stars ended their lives as more usual core-collapse supernovae.\nHowever, definitive limits on PPSNe will only come from space based NIR surveys.\nIf they result in detections, they will open a new window on star formation and the\nhistory of cosmological chemical enrichment. If they result in upper limits, they will\nplace exquisite constraints on the presence of PPSN forming in primordial environments\nabove the atomic cooing limit, but leave open the question of their formation in the first\n\"minihalos\" collapsing at extremely high redshift. While this would remain a possibility,\nthe absence of detections from space-based searches would limit PPSN to the most remote\nand undetectable corner of the universe. Undaunted theorists might still wish to discuss\nthem in workshops on the deepest depths of the cosmological dark ages. Observers may\nbe reminded that \"he who wishes to lie, should put the evidence far away\" (Livio 2006).\nI would like to thank my collaborators Chris Brook, Andrea Ferrara, Brad Gibson,\nAlexander Heger, Daisuke Kawata, Piero Madau, Raffaella Schneider, and Stan Woosley,\nfor allowing me to present the results of our work together here.
