Introduction\nThe b-quark mass is a fundamental parameter of QCD, and its accurate knowledge is needed\nfor theoretical predictions of B meson decay rates. The understanding of the latter is a very active\nfield of high energy physics research. At the same time the B meson decay constant plays a crucial\nrole in the description of these phenomena.\nWe focus our attention on the pseudoscalar Bs meson, a system characterized by two different\nscales: the heavy quark mass (mb \u223c 5 GeV) and the typical QCD scale. The mass of the strange\nquark is around or below the latter. We fix it to its physical value through mK as in [1].\n\n2. HQET and step scaling method (SSM)\nWe deal with these two scales in (quenched) lattice QCD with the SSM introduced in [2, 3],\nbut constraining the large mass behaviour by HQET [4]. The computation of an observable O(mh )\nusing the SSM is based on the identity\nO(mh , L\u221e ) = O(mh , L0 )\n\nO(mh , L1 )\nO(mh , LN ) O(mh , L\u221e )\n***\n,\nO(mh , L0 )\nO(mh , LN\u22121 ) O(mh , LN )\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere mh stands generically for a heavy quark mass whose precise definition is needed only later. In\norder to be able to extract each factor in the continuum limit, the starting volume L0 has to be small\nenough to properly account for the dynamics of the b-quark, using a relativistic O(a)-improved\naction. A good choice is L0 = 0.4 fm [2, 3], where easily lattice spacings of a \u2248 0.012 fm can be\nused. (Physical units are set using r0 = 0.5 fm [5, 6, 7]). Furthermore, L\u221e has to be large enough\nsuch that finite size effects in O(mh , L\u221e ) are negligible. In practise we will use L\u221e \u2248 L2 = 1.6 fm.\nWe will choose a fixed ratio s = Li /Li\u22121 in the step scaling functions\n\n\u03c3O (mh , Li ) =\n\nO(mh , Li )\n.\nO(mh , Li\u22121 )\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe number N and the scale ratio s of the steps are in principle dependent on the considered\nobservable and on the desired level of accuracy. It has been seen [2, 3] that (N, s) = (2, 2) is a\nsuitable choice for the mass and decay constant of the Bs meson.\nIn HQET the step scaling functions are expanded as\n(0)\n\u03c3O (mh , Li ) = \u03c3O (Li ) +\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1)\n\u03c3O (Li )\n1\nLi mh + O (Li mh )2\n\n(2.3)\n\nat fixed Li . We will see that the correction terms to the leading order are small for the masses of\ninterest.\nWe first consider the case of a finite volume pseudoscalar meson mass, O(mh , L) = MPS (mh , L),\n(0)\nwhich will be defined in the following section. In this case, \u03c3O = 1 and the first non-trivial term\n(1)\n\u03c3O is computable in the static approximation of HQET. We further define\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nx(mh , L) \u2261\n+O\n=\n,\nLMPS (mh , L) Lmh\n(Lmh )2\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fmb and fBs from a combination of HQET and QCD\n\nDamiano Guazzini\n\nas the natural non-perturbative dimensionless mass variable. The step scaling function for the\nmeson mass is then written as\n\n\u03c3m (x, Li ) \u2261\n\nMPS (mh , Li )\n= 1 + \u03c3mstat (Li ) * x + O(x2 ) ,\nMPS (mh , Li\u22121 )\n\nx = x(mh , Li ) .\n\n(2.5)\n\nIt is defined for all x, L. The idea for its numerical evaluation is to compute \u03c3mstat (L) explicitly in the\nstatic approximation and fix the small remainder by the relativistic QCD data with quarks of masses\nof the physical charm quark and higher. In other words we interpolate to the physical b-quark mas.\nWith the experimental mass of the Bs meson, MBs = 5.3675(18) GeV we fix x2 = 1/L2 MBs and the\nphysical points corresponding to the b-quark are then given by\nx2 = 1/(L2 MBs ) ,\n\nxi\u22121 = 2\u03c3m (xi , Li ) * xi .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe numerical results will have to be evaluated at these points. In the smallest volume we relate\nthe meson mass to the renormalization group invariant (RGI) quark mass, Mh , defining\n\n\u03c1 (x, L0 ) \u2261\n\nMPS (mh , L0 )\n= \u03c1 (0) (L0 ) + \u03c1 (1)(L0 ) * x + O(x2 ) .\nMh\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe thus have the connection of the Bs meson mass and the RGI b-quark mass\nMb =\n\nMBs\n.\n\u03c1 (x, L0 ) * \u03c3m (x1 , L1 ) * \u03c3m (x2 , L2 )\n\n(2.8)\n\nFor the decay constant the step scaling function\np\nfPS (mh , Li )pMPS (mh , Li )\n(1)\n\u03c3f (x, Li ) \u2261\n= \u03c3fstat (Li ) + \u03c3f (Li ) * x + O(x2 )\nfPS (mh , Li\u22121 ) MPS (mh , Li\u22121 )\n\n(2.9)\n\nyields straightforwardly the connection between the finite volume decay constant and the infinite\nvolume one. Note that the only approximation made in the above equations is to neglect finite size\neffects on mass and decay constant in the volume of linear extent L2 .\n\n3. Finite volume observables\n3.1 Relativistic QCD\nSuitable finite volume observables are defined in the QCD Schr\u00f6dinger functional [8, 9] with\na space-time topology L3 \u00d7 T , where T = 2L and C = C\u2032 = 0 is chosen for the boundary gauge\nfields, and \u03b8 = 0 for the phase in the spatial quark boundary conditions.\nThe O(a)-improved correlation functions fA (mh , L, x0 ), fP (mh , L, x0 ) and f1 (mh , L) are defined and\nrenormalized as in [2], allowing to compute the pseudoscalar meson decay constant\nfPS (mh , L) = q\n\nfA (mh , L, L)\n\u22122\np\nL3 MPS (mh , L) f1 (mh , L)\n\nmh \u2192mb\n\n=\n\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nfBs (L) = fBs\n\n(3.1)\n\nand the pseudoscalar meson mass\n\u0015\n\u0014\nL\u2192\u221e\nfA (mh , L, L \u2212 a) mh \u2192mb\n1\n= MBs (L) = MBs\nMPS (mh , L) = 2a ln\nfA (mh , L, L + a)\n3\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fmb and fBs from a combination of HQET and QCD\n\nDamiano Guazzini\n\nFor all observables computed in relativistic (quenched) QCD we employ the non-perturbatively\nO(a)-improved Wilson action[10, 11]. The data at finite heavy quark mass were published in [2, 3].\nThey have been reanalyzed, taking into account the correlation between observables computed on\nthe same gauge configurations. The statistical uncertainties on the renormalization constants and\nthe lattice spacing are included before performing the continuum limit extrapolations; they do not\nappear as a separate uncertainty.\n3.2 HQET\nIn the static approximation of HQET, unrenormalized correlation functions fAstat and f1stat are\ndefined in complete analogy to the relativistic ones, see [12]. As in this reference, we use the RGI\nstatic axial current, related to the bare one by a factor ZRGI . It serves to define the RGI ratio ,\nfAstat (L, L)\nYRGI (L) = ZRGI q\n,\nf1stat (L)\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is related to the QCD decay constant fPS via\nq\nfPS (mh , L) L3 MPS (L) = \u22122CPS (\u039bMS /Mh ) \u00d7YRGI (L) + O(1/mh ) .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe function CPS (\u039bMS /Mh ), defined in [12], can be accurately evaluated in perturbation theory;\nwe use the 3-loop anomalous dimension \u03b3 PS computed in [13]. Just like ZRGI , it is needed only for\nfPS (mh , L0 ); it cancels out in the step scaling functions.\n1\nln [ fAstat (L, L \u2212 a)/ fAstat (L, L + a)] . The\nIn analogy to eq. (3.2) we further define \u0393stat (L) = 2a\nstatic step scaling functions then read\n1 YRGI (Li ) ,\n\u03c3fstat (Li ) = 3/2\n2 YRGI (Li\u22121 )\n\n\u03c3mstat (Li ) = Li [\u0393stat (Li ) \u2212 \u0393stat (Li\u22121 )] ,\n\nLi = 2Li\u22121 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThese quantities will be precisely computed by using the static action denoted by HYP2 in [14]\n(see also [15]), and the corresponding O(a)-improvement coefficients for the static axial current.\nThe regularization independent part of the factor ZRGI is known from [12], while the regularization\ndependent one is computed in this work.\n\n4. Numerical results for the b quark mass\nThe computation of \u03c3m (x, L2 ) is performed at finite quark mass on lattices with \u03b2 = 5.960,\n6.211, 6.420 and resolutions L2 /a = 16, 24, 32; the continuum limits for the three heaviest\nquark masses are shown on the left of Figure 1. For the static step scaling function we took the\nresults for L = L2 from an extension[16] of the work of the ALPHA collaboration[17], while in the\nintermediate volume (L1 ) we simulated lattices with 5.960 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 6.737.

Numerical results for the decay constant\nFor the computation of \u03c3f (x, L2 ) the relativistic data originate from the same gauge configurations used earlier, while in the static case the decay constant in the bigger volume,\nYRGI (L2 ) = \u22124.63(19) ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwas again computed and extrapolated to the continuum limit as an extension [16] of [17].

The result\nYRGI (L1 ) = \u22121.628(19)\n(5.2)\nis used together with (5.1) and the relativistic data, as shown on Figure 2 (right), to get\n\n\u03c3fstat (L2 ) = 1.006(44),\n\n\u03c3f (x2 , L2 ) = 0.974(30) .\n\n(5.3)\n\nSimilarly, but by extrapolating the step scaling function to the continuum limit rather than YRGI (L1 )\nand YRGI (L0 ) separately, we obtain\n\n\u03c3fstat (L1 ) = 0.4337(44),\n\n\u03c3f (x1 , L1 ) = 0.4260(31) .\n5\n\n(5.4)\n\n0.08\n\n\fmb and fBs from a combination of HQET and QCD\n\nDamiano Guazzini\n\n\u22121.65\n\n1.2\n1.15\n\n\u22121.7\n\n\u22121.75\n\n\u03c3f(x,L2)\n\nYSF(L1)\n\n1.1\n\n\u22121.8\n\n1.05\n1\n0.95\n0.9\n\n\u22121.85\n\n0.85\n\u22121.9\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(a/L1)2\n\n10\n\u22123\n\n0.8\n\nx 10\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\nx\n\nFigure 2: Continuum extrapolation of YSF (L1 ) and interpolation of \u03c3f (x, L2 )\n\nWith the small volume results (see Figure 3)\n\nYRGI (L0 ) = \u22121.347(13),\n\nq\n\u2212 fBs (L0 ) L30 MPS (L0 )\nYPS (x0 , L0 ) =\n= \u22121.280(17) ,\n2CPS (\u039bMS /Mb )\n\n(5.5)\n\nwe finally arrive at the result\nfBs = 191(6) MeV .\n\n(5.6)\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe combination of the Tor Vergata strategy to compute properties of heavy-light mesons\n[2, 3] with the expansion of all quantities in HQET [4], changes extrapolations in the former computations into interpolations. As expected, our numerical results demonstrate that these are very\nwell behaved. Indeed the higher order mass dependence of the step scaling functions is very weak,\nand in all but one steps the static approximation alone gives very accurate results. In the one\nexception (YPS (x0 , L0 ), Fig. 3) the O(1/mb ) corrections are around 5%.\nOur results do not suffer from any systematic errors apart from the use of the quenched approximation; small systematic errors quoted in [2, 3] for the extrapolation uncertainties have been\neliminated. Our results are in agreement with the ones of [2, 3, 17, 21], within the errors.\nConcerning dynamical fermion computations, the challenge in this strategy is to simulate in a large\nvolume (such as L2 ) with small enough lattice spacings, where quark masses of around mcharm and\nhigher can be simulated with confidence.\nAcknowledgement.
