In recent years, also\nspin transport through quantum dots formed by nanotubes, molecular systems or nanoparticles has started\nto attract attention both experimentally2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and\ntheoretically.9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 One of the motivations for\nthis has been the possibility of using quantum dots with\na single spin as qubits, but naturally also a number of\nfundamental questions arise on how the interplay of spin\ncoherence and interactions influences the transport.\nWhen the spin coherence is maintained during the electron passage through the mesoscopic structure, the transport needs to be described in a coherent fashion at least\nfor spin degree of freedom. Even for weak tunneling one\ntherefore has to modify the usual rate equation approach\nif the magnetization directions are non-collinear.9,13,14\nFor stronger tunneling coupling also many of the nonequilibrium Green's function methods fail to describe the\ncase when both interactions and spin coherence are important, such as for example the Hubbard I approximations used in Refs. 15,16.19\nFor the strong coupling case, a particular interesting\nsituation occurs when the mesoscopic system has a magnetization which is non-collinear with respect to that of\nthe ferromagnetic leads, which is what is studied in this\npaper. We study the conductance of a single-level quantum dot connected to ferromagnetic leads, and, in addition, the spin states of the quantum dot being split due\nto, e.g., an applied magnetic field. Experimentally, one\ncould realize this geometry if the magnetic leads are fabricated as magnetic thin films, where the magnetic field\nis strongly pinned in the plane parallel to the film, so\nthat a small magnetic field component can be applied\nto the quantum dot without changing the magnetization\ndirection of the leads. The geometry of the device is illustrated in Fig. 1. We describe the system using a modified Anderson Hamiltonian where the leads are assumed\nto be polarized and the magnetic field gives rise to an\n\nB\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic drawing of the quantum dot system, connected to two ferromagnetic leads. In addition, there is an\napplied magnetic which spin polarizes the quantum dot in\na direction non-collinear to the magnetization of the leads.\nIn this paper, we focus on how the conductance depends on\nthe angle \u03c6, and the interplay between interactions and spin\ninterference.\n\nenergy splitting of the dot level. This gives an effective\ndouble-slit geometry with two different paths through the\ncentral region. In the case of parallel magnetizations of\nthe leads and no Coulomb repulsion on the dot, we find\nsharp anti-resonances in the conductance for certain angles \u03c6, which is explained as destructive interference. If\nthe Coulomb repulsion on the dot is increased, a crossover to a simple spin-valve behavior is seen. Changing\nthe angle \u03c6 in an experimental setup can therefore indicate whether interactions on the dot are important or if\na single-electron picture is sufficient. On the other hand,\nin the case of anti-parallel magnetizations of the leads\nno change in the angular dependence is observed when\nthe Coulomb repulsion on the dot is increased. Finally,\nwe limit ourselves in this paper to the study of linear\nresponse, so non-equilibrium effects associated with spin\naccumulation are not included.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we set\nup the model Hamiltonian. We start by calculating the\nconductance for the non-interacting case in Section III,\nand in Section IV we consider the cotunneling limit. Finally, in Section V we discuss the result and its limitations.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMODEL HAMILTONIAN\n\nThe model Hamiltonian of the quantum dot coupled\nto magnetic leads is\nH = HLR + HT + HD ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nX\n\nHLR =\n\n\u03be\u03b1,k\u03c3 c\u2020\u03b1,k\u03c3 c\u03b1,k\u03c3 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1=L,R,k\u03c3\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the left or right electrode and where we\nhave assumed that the polarizations of the electrodes are\nparallel or anti-parallel.

The conductance for the noninteracting case in both the parallel (left panel) and the antiparallel (right panel) cases for different values of the magnetic\nstrength and at the symmetric point \u03be0 = 0. For the parallel\ncase, destructive interference leads to an anti-resonance for\n\u03c6 = \u03c0/2. The anti-resonance sharpens as B/\u03930 decreases.\nThe conductance is maximal when the applied field is parallel to magnetizations in the leads (\u03c6 = 0 or \u03c0). In contrast,\nfor the anti-parallel case the current is maximal for \u03c6 = \u03c0/2\nand vanishes at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c0 because of the spin-valve effect.\n\nLet us look at the symmetric condition x = 0, where\nthe incoming energy lies symmetrically between the spin\nsplit levels:\nTP (\u03be0 ) =\n\n\u03930L \u03930R\ncos2 \u03c6\n.\nB 2 1 + y 2 cos2 \u03c6\n\n(15)\n\nThis yields a sharp anti-resonance when the dot magnetization is perpendicular to the magnetization direction of\nthe leads. The anti-resonance occurs due to a destructive\ninterference between the transmissions through the two\nspin split levels, as explained in the following section. It is\ninteresting to note that the zero transmission at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2\nis not broadened by higher order tunneling events, as one\nmight have expected. Moreover, for the non-symmetric\nsituation x 6= 0, the anti-resonance remains, but is shifted\naway from \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 to the point where x = cos \u03c6, which\nfollows from Eq. (13). The anti-resonance found here is\nin fact similar to an effect exploited in single atom transmission through optical lattices.18\nNext, we look at the antiparallel situation. Therefore\nwe set PL = \u2212PR = 1 and find\nTAP (\u01eb) =\n\n4\u03930L \u03930R sin2 \u03c6\n,\nB2\nD\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n2 2\n2\n2\nD = 4(1 \u2212 x2 )2 + 2yL yR + yL\nyR /4 + (yR\n+ yL\n)x2\n2\n2\n+ 2(yL\n\u2212 yR\n)x cos \u03c6 + (yL \u2212 yR )2 cos2 \u03c6,\n\nTPmax(\u03be0 ) =\n\n(17)\n\nwith y\u03b1 = \u03930\u03b1 /B. Note that for the symmetric coupling\n\u03930L = \u03930R , the only angle dependence is the sin2 \u03c6 factor\nin the numerator. In Fig. 2 we show examples of the angle\ndependence of the conductance for both the parallel and\nantiparallel cases.\nA difference between the parallel and antiparallel geometry is the existence of an optimal B-value in the\nantiparallel case. Considering the symmetric condition\n\n\u03930L \u03930R\n,\nB 2 + (\u03930 /2)2\n\n(18)\n\nwhich decreases when increasing B, because the levels are\nmoved away from the chemical potentials of the leads.\nFor the antiparallel geometry, the maximal transmission\nat the symmetric condition is (\u03c6 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2)\nmax\nTAP\n(\u03be0 ) =\n\n\u03930L \u03930R\n\n(19)\n2,\n[B + \u03930L \u03930R /(4B)]\np\nand the optimal value Bopt = \u03930L \u03930R /4 is found. This\nvalue is a comprise between the spin blockade for B = 0\nand the levels being far from the chemical potentials of\nthe leads for B/\u03930 \u226b 1.\nFinally, Fig. 3 shows how the conductance changes\nwhen \u03be0 is varied. In the parallel case, the destructive\ninterference only occurs close to the symmetric condition, x \u2248 0, whereas when both levels are above or below\nthe resonance a simple spin valve effect is observed. If\none of the levels is exactly at the chemical potentials of\nthe leads the conductance is constant (\u03be0 = \u00b1B). For\nthe antiparallel case no qualitative change in the angular\ndependence is seen.\nIV.\n\nCOTUNNELING CURRENT FOR THE\nINTERACTING CASE\n\nIn the presence of interactions the interesting interference effect discussed above can be significantly changed.\nNaturally, this is in general a difficult problem to tackle.\nHere we look at the case where the position of the levels is\nfar from resonance as defined below, and a second order\nperturbation calculation suffices. This is the \"cotunneling\" regime, where an electron is transferred through the\nsystem in a two-electron process. The cotunneling appproach is valid far from resonance, i.e. when |\u03b5\u2191 \u2212 \u03bc|\nand |\u03b5\u2193 + U | are larger than the bias, temperature and\ntunneling broadening.\nFor the resonant case the cotunneling result diverges\nand there is a cross-over to the sequential tunneling\nregime, see App. A. In these points interactions are not\nimportant, because transport is determined by only one\nlevel.\nWe calculate the current using a scattering formalism\nand the transition rate per unit time between an initial\nstate i (with energy Ei ) and a final state f (with energy\nEf ) is calculated as\n\u0393f i =\n\n2\u03c0\n|hf |T |ii|2 \u03b4(Ef \u2212 Ei ),\nh\u0304\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the transition operator T\u0302 is\nT\u0302 = HT + HT\n\n1\nT\u0302\nEi \u2212 H0 + i\u03b7\n\n(21)\n\n\f4\n\u03b52\n\u03b5\u2193\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n\u03b52\n\u03b5\u2193\n\n2\n\n\u03b5\u2191\n\n\u03b52\n\u03b5\u2193\n\n\u03b5\u2191\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03b5\u2191\n\n\u03be0\n\n(i )\n\n(ii )\n\n(iii )\n\nFIG. 4: The three different cotunneling regimes considered\n(\u03b52 = \u03b5\u2191 + \u03b5\u2193 + U ).\n-2\n\n-2\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b52\n\n2\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\u03b5\u2193\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n\u03b5\u2191\n\n\u03be0\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c6\n\n2\u03c0\n\nFIG. 3: Contour plots of the conductance in the noninteracting case for the parallel (top panel) and antiparallel\n(lower panel) geometry for different values of the angle \u03c6 and\nthe orbital dot quantum dot energy \u03be0 /\u03930 (B/\u03930 = 1 in both\nfigures). For the antiparallel geometry the same angular dependence is observed for all \u03be0 , whereas a change is seen for\nthe parallel geometry as explained in the text.\n\nand H0 = HLR + HD . The current is now given by\nprocesses which bring an electron from the left to the\nright lead, \u0393RL , minus the opposite processes:\nJ = e(\u0393RL \u2212 \u0393LR ).\n\n2\n\n\u03b5\u2191\n\n(B)\n\nFIG. 5: The two possible second order processes contributing\nto the tunneling amplitude, here shown for the parallel configuration in the first regime.

Thus, in the initial state\nthe leads can be considered as two non-interacting electron gasses (here assumed fully spin-polarized) with different chemical potentials. The probability to find the\nlead \u03b1 in a state \u03bd\u03b1 is denoted W\u03bd\u03b1 . Because the leads\nare non-interacting, W\u03bd\u03b1 satisfies\nX\n(23)\nW\u03bd\u03b1 h\u03bd\u03b1 |c\u2020\u03b1,k\u03c3 c\u03b1,k\u03c3 |\u03bd\u03b1 i = nF (\u03b5\u03b1,k\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 ).\n\u03bd\u03b1\n\nThree different regimes are considered (see Fig. 4):\ni) the level with the lowest energy is always occupied\nand the other energy level always empty, i.e. \u03b5\u2191 < \u03bc and\n\n\u03b5\u2193 > \u03bc,\nii) both levels are empty, i.e. \u03b5\u2191 > \u03bc and \u03b5\u2193 > \u03bc,\niii) both levels occupied, i.e. \u03b5\u2191 < \u03bc and \u03b5\u2193 + U < \u03bc.\nWe show how the result is obtained for the first regime\nwith parallel geometry and only state the results for the\nother regimes.\nIn case i), the initial states can be written as\n|ii = |\u03bdL , \u03bdR , \u2191i, with energy Ei = E\u03bdL + E\u03bdR + \u03b5\u2191\nand probability W\u03bdL W\u03bdR . First, we outline the derivation for \u0393RL in the parallel configuration. In the fully\npolarized case, the leads contain only electrons with\none kind of spin, say spin-up, and the final states are\n|fkk\u2032 i = c\u2020R,k\u2191 cL,k\u2032 \u2191 |ii, meaning that an electron is\nmoved from the left to the right lead in the process. Inserting the expressions for the final states and the tunneling Hamiltonian in Eqs. (20) and (21), we see that\nthe first non-vanishing term is second order in the coupling HT . Moreover, two processes give a contribution:\nA) first the electron on the dot jumps to the right lead\nand later an electron from the left lead refills the dot, or\nB) a left lead electron enters the dot, creating a double\noccupied state, and later leaves the dot to the right. The\ntwo processes are sketched in Fig. 5.

It is seen how the destructive interference only occurs in regime i), i.e. when the\nlevels are split on each side of the chemical potentials and\nthe interactions are not too strong. The angular dependence for the two other regimes depends on which level\nis closest to the chemical potential of the leads.\n\n\f6\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nFor the non-interacting case we found the exact linear\nresponse conductance. For the parallel configuration we\nsaw that the angular dependence could be understood\nin terms of an interference effect occurring due to the\nspin-splitting of the dot. For \u03c6 = 0 the spin bases of\nthe dot and the leads are identical, and the electrons can\nonly pass through the dot via the spin-\u2191 level. For a\nnon-collinear magnetic field the dot spin eigenstates are\nsuperpositions of the lead spin states, which gives two\npossible paths through the dot. This leads to destructive interference at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, and the resonance sharpens as the tunneling coupling increases. This result is\nin agreement with the cotunneling result in Eq. (29) setting U = 0. Interestingly, the destructive interference\nis destroyed by interactions, giving rise to an interaction\ninduced enhancement of the conductance. Thus the conductance goes from being proportional to cos2 \u03c6 in the\nnon-interacting case to being proportional to cos4 (\u03c6/2)\nfor the strongly interacting case. However, if the leads\nare not fully polarized the angular dependence persists,\nbut is gradually washed out for decreasing polarization.\nFor the antiparallel geometry the situation is very different. In the non-interacting case (and symmetric coupling) the conductance is proportional to sin2 \u03c6 for all\nvalues of B/\u03930 . This is simply understood as a spinvalve effect, giving zero conductance at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0,\nwhereas for non-collinear B-field the spin can flip when it\npasses the dot. Furthermore, in this case there is a constructive interference at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2. Now, with interactions\non the dot one spin channel becomes partially blocked,\nbut the angular dependence remains the same even in\nthe limit of large U . This is thus in stark contrast to\nthe above mentioned cross-over observed for the parallel\nconfiguration.\nWe have thus focused on two cases: 1) strong tunneling and no interaction, and 2) weak tunneling with\ninteraction. The cross-over between these two regimes is\nan interesting and challenging issue, because a formalism\nthat captures both coherence and correlations on equal\nfooting is needed.\n\ncompleteness, we here give the results for the sequential\ntunneling limit for parallel magnetization.\nIn the parallel case, we can use the conductance formula derived by Meir and Wingreen17 for proportional\ncoupling if we also assume that P = PL = PR . With\nthese assumptions, we have\nG=\n\nie2\nh\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n\nwhere\n\u03930 \u03930\n\u0393 = 0 L R0\n\u0393L + \u0393R\n\nIn the main part, we have discussed the effects of higher\norder tunneling where interference effects take place.
