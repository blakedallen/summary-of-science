The typical timescales in these systems are also\n105 \u2212 107 times shorter than those in quasars, thus evolutions of microquasar jets can be studied in\ndetails. Therefore, microquasar systems have been considered ideal laboratories for understanding\naccretion process in black hole systems and might provide us a good alternative to study AGN\nphenomena instead of observing them directly (Massi & Kaufman Bernad\u00f3 2008).\nSince discovered in 1992, radio jets have been observed in a series of BH binary systems and\nseveral of them showed apparent superluminal features. In the two well known microquasars, GRS\n1915+105 (Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez 1999) and GRO J1655-40 (Tingay et al. 1995; Hjellming & Rupen\n1995), relativistic jets with actual velocities greater than 0.9c were observed. In some other systems,\nsmall-size \"compact jets\", e.g. Cyg X-1 (Stirling et al. 2001), and large scale diffuse emission, e.g.\nSS433 (Dubner et al. 1998), were also detected.\nAmong these microquasars, XTE J1550-564 is especially interesting since it was the first Galactic accretion systems that a fast moving X-ray jet was detected. The large scale and long existing\ntime of the jets have also made this source unique and valuable in jet studies. XTE J1550-564\nwas discovered with RXTE in 1998 during its strong X-ray outburst on September 7 (Smith 1998).\nIt is believed to be an X-ray binary system at a distance of \u223c5.3 kpc, containing a black hole of\n10.5\u00b11.0 solar masses and a low mass companion star (Orosz et al. 2002). Soon after the discovery\nof the source, a jet ejection with an apparent velocity greater than 2c was reported by VLBI team\n(Hannikainen et al. 2001). In the period between 1998 and 2002, the source also exhibited strong\nX-ray activities but no similar radio and X-ray flares were detected again during these activities\n(Tomsick et al. 2003).\nWith the Chandra satellite, Corbel et al. (2002) found two large scale X-ray jets lying to the\neast and west of the central source, which were also in good alignment with the central source.\nThe eastern jet has been detected first in 2000 at a projected distance of \u223c21 arcsec and a position\nangle E of N of 93.8o \u00b10.9o from the central black hole. Its apparent proper motion velocity has\ndropped from an average of \u223c32.9 mas/day between 1998 and 2000 to \u223c21.2 mas/day during its\n2000 observations; its X-ray flux also decayed quite rapidly. Two years later, it could only be seen\nmarginally in the X-ray image, while a western counterpart became visible at \u223c22 arcsec on the\nother side. The corresponding radio maps are consistent with the X-ray observations (Corbel et al.\n2002).\nFrom the year 2002 to 2003, there were altogether five observations of this source in the\nChandra archive. The eastern jet has disappeared from the X-ray images in late 2002, while the\nwestern jet could be seen clearly in all the five observations, although the flux decayed quickly as\nwell. Among these observations, only the first two have been reported and discussed previously\n(Kaaret et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003). We therefore use these additional data points to better\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nconstrain the kinematic and spectral analysis for the eastern jet, and to extend the analysis to the\nwestern jet.\nIn this paper, we first describe the observational data obtained by Chandra X-ray satellite in\nsection 2 and 3. Then we propose a model for the system and discuss the kinematic and emission\nprocess in section 4. Finally in section 5 and 6, we apply this model to another source H 1743-322\nand make some further discussions based on these analysis.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS of XTE J1550-564\n\nThere are altogether eight 2-dimensional imaging observations of XTE J1550-564 in the Chandra\narchive during June 2000 and October 2003 (henceforth observations 1\u223c8). These observations were\nall made by the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). There are also grating observations\nproviding 1-dimensional imaging in the archive; but since our interests are in the jet kinematics\nanalysis, these are not our focus at this stage.\nWe have down-loaded all data of these eight observations from the archive and examined\nthe level 2 event files produced by Standard Data Processing procedures to make our analysis.\nExposure time for these observations ranges from a few kiloseconds (observations 1\u223c3) to a few\ntens of kiloseconds (observations 4\u223c8) (Table 1). Background light curves are extracted for each\nof the observations and only in observation 5 a high background flare is detected. Except for this\nperiod, almost all valid exposure time intervals of these observations are included in our work.\nIn the section 2 and 3, we limit most of our analysis to the kinematic and spectral properties\nof the western jet. The central accreting source has already attracted much attention in recent\nyears and there were already plenty of studies in details in literature (Corbel et al. 2001; Jain et al.\n2001; Kubota & Makishima 2004; Yuan et al. 2007). The eastern jet has also been studied fully\nin 2003 when it was discovered (Tomsick et al. 2003; Kaaret et al. 2003). As a result, we do not\ndiscuss much of our results for observations 1\u223c3 here; only comparisons with the previous works\nwill be noted for consistency. A complete study of the kinematic and light curve evolution of the\nwestern jet is our main goal in these two sections.\nWe list the basic information of observations 1\u223c8 in Table 1, including the observation ID,\ndate, the positions of the central point source and the eastern and western jets respectively (in\nJ2000 coordinate). The positions are obtained by the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations\n(CIAO) routine wavdetect (Freeman et al. 2002), a commonly used program in determining X-ray\nsources in Chandra images. From this table, we could see clearly that an X-ray emission source\nis detected to the east of the central source in the first four observations and another source is\ndetected to the west in the last five observations. Calculations also show that these two sources,\nwhen presented in a single combined image, are in good alignment with the central compact object\nwith a position angle E of N of -85.9o \u00b10.3o . In observations 5 and 6, no X-ray source is detected\nby wavdetect at the position of the eastern jet. However, from the Gaussian smoothed images\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(Fig. 2), a weak source could be recognized in observation 6. We thus select the strongest emission\nregion of this source manually with a small circle of the radius of 0.7 arcsec and use the position of\nits center as one data point in our further analysis.\nIn Fig.1, the raw, unsmoothed images of the last five observations are shown. An extended\nand moving source can be seen easily in these images. Its elongation points towards the central\nsource, and has thus indicated clearly the relation between them. In most cases the flux from this\nwestern source is comparable to the central source; however in observation 5, the observed surface\nbrightness from the western source is even higher than the central source (also see section 3).\nWith the data in Table 1, we can calculate the angular separations between the jets and the\ncentral source as well as the average proper motions. In this paper, we have adopted the assumption\nthat both the eastern and western jets are related to the same outburst in September 1998. Except\nfor the outburst occurred in 1998, there were some other outbursts detected afterwards, including\na major outburst in 2000 and some mini-outbursts in 2001 to 2003 (Tomsick et al. 2003 and\nreferences therein). However, the long term RXTE-ASM light curve shows that the X-ray flux of\nthe 1998 outburst is four times higher than that of the 2000 outburst and more than twenty times\nhigher than that of all the rest (Sturner & Shrader 2005). The complex behaviors found in the\n1998 outburst, such as irregular light curves and multiple state transitions, were not detected in\nother outbursts. The two X-ray jets are also found to be aligned with the 1998 radio jets (Corbel et\nal. 2002), which is also consistent with the assumption of a common origin of the two jets, but by\nitself does not provide definite evidence for the assumption unless the source is precessing strongly.\nBased on the above arguments, we conclude that it is reasonable to assume that both the eastern\nand western jets originated from the same 1998 outburst.\nOur calculation results are listed in Table 2. A distance of approximately 23 arcsec is obtained\nfor the western jet with a slowly increasing value; errors are estimated following the method described by Tomsick et al. (2003). We calculate the source centroid for the central source and the\nX-ray jet respectively and for all the five observations, the changes of the newly calculated position\nwith the previous results are less than 0.5\u2032\u2032 . Therefore, an upper limit of 0.5\u2032\u2032 is set for the error of\nthe jet distance (except the eastern jet in observation 6, where a larger error of 1 arcsec was set\nbecause of the manual selection method we applied). We divide the net angular separation by the\ntime interval between the neighboring observations to estimate the average proper motion for the\njets, and from the results, an approximate estimate of deceleration could be seen for both jets.

Observation 4 shows\nthe good alignment of the two jets and the central source. The images are aligned by RA (x-axis).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe much longer exposure time, the total counts collected from each of the last five observations\nare much more than those from the first three. We use a circular source region with a radius of\n4\u2032\u2032 , an annular background region with an inner radius of 5\u2032\u2032 and an outer radius of 15\u2032\u2032 , for each\nobservation. The photon number inside each selected region is about a few hundreds, possible for\nspectral analysis, compared to only \u223c20 counts in the jet region in observations 1, 2 and 3. We\nperform background subtraction but did not make independent background spectra.\nInstrument response matrices (rmf) and weighted auxiliary response files (warf) are created\nusing CIAO programs mkacisrmf and mkwarf and used in the fitting in Xspec. We re-bin the\nspectra with 10 counts per bin and fit them in Xspec. Several spectral models are tested, but the\nstatistical quality is not high enough to distinguish between them completely. Taking observation 4\nfor example (for the reason that the photon number of this observation is the largest), synchrotron\nmodel (powerlaw) and self Compton scattering (compsl) seem to work equally well with the corresponding reduced \u03c72 of 0.924 and 0.925. Their combination (powerlaw+compsl) does not improve\nthe fitting (\u03c72 \u223c 0.981), but creates a large uncertainty for each parameter (the best fitting photon\nindex is 2 \u00b1 28 in the combined model).\nIn table 3, the results of spectra fitting to the western jet with an absorbed power-law model\nare shown (spectra shown in Fig. 3). The absorption column density is fixed to the Galactic value\nin the direction of XTE J1550-564 obtained by the radio observations (NH = 9\u00d71021 cm\u22122 ) (Dickey\n& Lockman 1990). The first two observations (obs. 4 & 5) have been analyzed by Kaaret et al.\n(2003), and our results are quite consistent with their work. The mean photon index of the five\nobservations is around 1.8, also consistent with the previous work on the eastern jet (Tomsick et\nal. 2003). A slightly different photon index is obtained for observation 6 and 8; however, the value\nof 1.8 is still within the 1-\u03c3 error range. The calculated absorbed energy flux in 0.3-8 keV band\nis comparable to the value of the eastern jet. The observed flux decayed from \u223c 1.9 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 in March 2002 to only one sixth of this value in October 2003 (see section 4.2). For\nobservation 6, we also try to fit the spectrum of the eastern jet. However, the data points are\njust too few to yield a satisfactory result. With only 17 counts between 0.3 to 10 keV inside a\n8-arcsec-diameter circle, we obtained a reduced \u03c72 of only 0.13 when using the chi-squared statistic\nin fitting. When changing to the Cash statistic, a more suitable method for low counts cases, the\nresulting photon index is 1.11 and the estimated flux is 1.6\u00d710\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , even higher than\nthe value in observation 4. We consider this result not very convincing, or the re-heating process\nis more complicated than a simple shock. Complete understanding of this problem is beyond the\nscope of the current work. As a result, we drop this spectral data point in the light curve fitting.\n\n4.\n\nJET MODEL\n\nWe now describe the model of Wang et al. (2003), and apply it to the data, demonstrating\nhow it needs to be revised to fit the full set of observations of the eastern and western jets. The\nkinematic and light curve models are constructed according to the external shock model in the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- X-ray spectra of emission from the western jet during March 2002 and October 2003. The\nfive panels are data from observations 4\u223c8 respectively. An absorbed power-law model with the\nneutral hydrogen column density fixed to the Galactic value, 9 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 , is used in the fitting.\nValues of all fitted parameters are listed in Table 3.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nstandard gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow theory. In this model, the kinematic evolution and\nlight curve of the jets can be interpreted by the interactions between the jet materials and the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). The relativistic ejecta losses its energy to the ISM and is therefore\nslowed down to non-relativistic phase. In Wang et al. (2003), they used the reverse shock emission\nmodel to fit the light curve of the eastern jet successfully. We therefore apply this model to the\nanalysis of the western jet as well.\n\n4.1.\n\nKinematic Model\n\nAs we know, in the external shock model for afterglows of GRBs, the kinematic and light curve\nevolution could be understood as the interaction between the outburst ejecta and the surrounding\nISM (Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1992). Since microquasar systems are also Galactic sources embedded inside\nthe ISM, we may infer that the jets of microquasars should also encounter such interactions and thus\nbe decelerated during their expansion. The large scale and long existing time of XTE J1550-564\njets have provided us a good opportunity to test this scenario.\nBecause of the good alignment of the two jets and the central accreting object, we adopt\nthe model of a collimated conical beam with a half opening angle \u03b8j expanding into the ambient\nmedium with the number density n. The initial kinematic energy and Lorentz factor of the outflow\nmaterial are E0 and \u03930 , respectively. Shocks should arise as the outflow moves on and heat the\nISM, and its kinematic energy will turn into the internal energy of the medium gradually. Neglect\nthe radiation loss, the energy conservation equation writes (Huang, Dai, & Lu 1999):\n(\u0393 \u2212 1)M0 c2 + \u03c3(\u03932sh \u2212 1)mSW c2 = E0 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term on the left of the equation represents the kinematic energy of the ejecta, where\n\u0393 is the Lorentz factor and M0 is the mass of the original ejecta. The second term represents the\ninternal energy of the swept-up ISM, where \u0393sh and mSW are the corresponding Lorentz Factor\nand mass of the shocked ISM respectively, and\nmSW = Vg mp n(\u03b8j2 /4),\n\n(2)\n\nwith Vg as the shocked gas volume. Coefficient \u03c3 differs from 6/17 to 0.73 for ultra-relativistic and\nnon-relativistic jets (Blandford & McKee 1976). Wang et al. (2003) took \u03c3 \u223c0.7 and we adopt\ntheir approximation in our work. Equation (1) and the relativistic kinematic equations\n(\n\n\u03b2(\u0393)c\ndR\n\u03b2(\u0393)c\ndR\n)a =\n;(\n)r =\ndt\n1 \u2212 \u03b2(\u0393) cos \u03b8 dt\n1 + \u03b2(\u0393) cos \u03b8\n\n(3)\n\ncan be solved and give the relation between the projected angular separation \u03bc and time t. In\nequations (2), the subscript 'a' and 'r' represent the approaching and receding jets in a pair of\nrelativistic jets respectively. R is the distance between the jet and the source, which can be\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ntransformed into the angular separation by \u03bc = R sin \u03b8/5.3 kpc, and \u03b8 is the jet inclination angle\nto the line of sight. We can get the \u03bc \u2212 t curve numerically with the above equations. To be\nconsistent with the work done to the eastern jet, we test first the same initial conditions that\n\u03930 = 3, E0 = 3.6 \u00d7 1044 erg, \u03b8 = 50o and \u03b8j = 1.o 5 as those found by Wang et al. (2003) and would\nlike to find how these parameters affect the fitting of the jet motions.\nIn the case of the eastern jet, the number density of the ISM was assumed by Wang et al. (2003)\nas a constant in the whole region outside the central source, thus the interaction was supposed to\nhave taken place all the way along the jet's path. This assumption does not work well in the case of\nits western counterpart, because the western jet has traveled by 2002 as far as the eastern jet had\ntraveled by 2000, but was decelerated much more significantly. This can be seen in Fig. 4. The\nwestern jet moved comparatively little after its appearance and acted like \"hitting into a wall\".\nThis requires much stronger interactions and thus a much denser environment. We tried to fit\nthe western jet itself but were not very successful. If we increase the number density, the gas will\nsimply block the jet and the jet will never travel to such a far distance (a 1044 erg jet can only\nmove to \u223c7-8 arcsec in 1 cm\u22123 ISM). On the other hand, if the initial energy is too large (\u223c1050\nerg), the jet could penetrate ISM and travel far but would be very difficult to slow down so quickly\n(for such high energy, even a density of 100 cm\u22123 can not bend the curve down). Changing the\ninitial Lorentz factor has similar results with changing initial energy and the opening angle of the\njet affects the results quite little. This tendencies are plotted in Fig.4 (a), where the fitting to the\neastern jet shows the model of Wang et al. (2003) and the corresponding solid-line fitting to the\nwestern jet uses the same model and same parameters. The dashed line and dot dashed line there\nrepresent the results of changing the number density or the initial kinetic energy to ten times of\nthe eastern results. All three curves do not match the data points well.\nAs a result, we consider keeping the initial Lorentz factor and energy, while changing the\ngeometric assumptions to describe the jet motions. For the inclination angle, we first examined the\npaper of Orosz et al. (2002), where they find a value of 72.6 \u00b1 4.8o from the optical observations.\nWe took this value, but varying it within their 1-sigma error bars, and find \u03b8 = 68o gives out the\nbest fit. To simplify the problem, we just fix the inclination angle to this value in our work.\nAfter setting the inclination angle, we test a model that the ISM density varies as the distance\nchanges, i.e., the density is lower in the center and higher in the outside region. For simplicity, we\ntest the case that the jet traveled first through a \"cavity\" with a constant velocity and then through\na dense region and was decelerated there. For this modification, we introduce another parameter\nr, the outer radius of the cavity. The ISM number density is set to be a constant n outside this\nregion and zero inside. The results are shown in panel (b) and (c) in Fig.4. We first apply this\nmodel to the eastern and the western jet separately. The results are quite satisfactory but not well\nconstrained. Because of only 10 data points in constraining 4 free parameters (re , rw , ne , nw ), there\nare more than one group of parameters that seem work well. Fitting the two jets simultaneously\nwith a fixed cavity radius helps a bit. It constrains the fitting tighter and r = 16 arcsec seems\nan acceptable result for the both sides (Fig.4 (b)). However, this is not a sound assumption. The\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ninferred ISM number density corresponding to this value is 0.015 cm\u22123 in the east and 0.06 cm\u22123\nin the west respectively, indicating a clear asymmetry in the ISM density on the two side. Thus\nit is not reasonable to assume a perfect symmetric geometry. We still need other analysis to help\ndetermining consistent parameters.\n\n4.2.\n\nLight Curve Model\n\nIn the standard GRB scenario, the afterglow emission is produced by the synchrotron radiation\nor inverse Compton emission of the accelerated electrons in the shock front of the jets. The forward\nshock emission is from the heated electrons in the swept-up ambient medium, whereas the reverse\nshock emission is from the electrons of the jet itself when a shock moves back through the ejecta.\nThe same processes should also happen in the case of microquasars, with only the Lorentz factor\nmuch lower. In Wang et al. (2003), they tested these two possibilities and proved that the forward\nshock emission would decay too slowly to fit for the observed decay index \u22123.7 \u00b1 0.7 of the eastern\njet, because of the continuously heating effect. However, since only operating once, the reverse\nshock emission could decay rather fast as the electrons cooled adiabatically and this model indeed\nperformed quite well in describing the data. In the case of the western jet, the energy flux decayed\neven more rapidly (decay index \u223c \u22125.1 \u00b1 0.1, see Fig. 5) and as a result, we take the reverse shock\nmechanism in our work.\nAssuming the distribution of the electrons obeys a power-law form, n(\u03b3e )d\u03b3e = K\u03b3e\u2212p d\u03b3e , for\n\u03b3m < \u03b3e < \u03b3M , the volume emissivity at frequency \u03bd \u2032 in the comoving frame is given by (Rybicki &\nLightman 1979)\n\u221a 3\n3q 4\u03c0me c\u03bd \u2032 (1\u2212p) (p+1)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n, \u03bdM\n),\n(4)\n(\n) 2 B\u22a5 2 KF1 (\u03bd, \u03bdm\nj\u03bd \u2032 =\n2me c2\n3q\nwhere\nZ \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nF1 (\u03bd, \u03bdm\n, \u03bdM\n)=\n\n\u03bd /\u03bdm\n\nF (x)x(p\u22123)/2 dx,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\u03bd \u2032 /\u03bdM\n\nR +\u221e\nwith F (x) = x x K5/3 (t)dt and K5/3 (t) is the Bessel function.

The model for the\nwestern jet is based on the same parameters. The dashed and dotted lines are the results if the\nnumber density or the initial kinematic energy is changed to ten times of the eastern results.

The\ncomoving frequency \u03bd \u2032 relates to our observer frequency \u03bd by \u03bd = D\u03bd \u2032 , where D is the Doppler\nfactor and we have Da = 1/\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8) and Dr = 1/\u0393(1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8) for the approaching and\nreceding jets respectively. Considering the geometry of the emission region, the observed X-ray\nflux in 0.3-8 keV band could be estimated by\nF (0.3 \u2212 8keV) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd1\n\n\u03b8j2 R\n[ ( )\u2206RD3 j\u03bd \u2032 ]d\u03bd,\n4 d\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206R is the width of the shock region and is assumed to be \u2206R = R/10, after Wang et al.\n(2003) in the calculation.\nTo reduce the number of free parameters, we set \u03b3m = 100 in our calculation because the\nresults are quite insensitive to this value. According to our kinematic model in section 4.1, we\nchoose the time that the reverse shock takes place to be the time that the Lorentz factor reduced\n\u221a\nto 1/ 2 of its original value, which is called deceleration timescale tdec in the GRB external shock\nmodel, which is supposed to be the strongest point of the external shock (Private communication\nwith X. Y. Wang). Then we fit the data to find out the initial values of K and B\u22a5 .\nJust like the fitting to the kinematics of the jets, we could not decide the best fitting result\nonly using the flux data since we could always find one group of parameters that fit the flux data\napproximately well for each parameter r. Thus, we combine the kinematic and light curve fitting\ntogether to find some more useful hints.\nWe know that the energy and the number density of the gas in the pre-shock and post-shock\nregions are connected by the jump conditions n\u2032 = \u03b6(\u0393)n and e\u2032 = \u03b7(\u0393)nmp c2 , where \u03b6(\u0393) and \u03b7(\u0393)\nare coefficients related to the jet velocity (Wang et al. 2003 ).

Since we have assumed that p and \u03930 (so that 1/ 2\u03930 ) are equal for the two jets, if we\nfurther assume that factor \u01ebe of the eastern and the western jets is also the same, we may infer\nthat K \u221d e\u2032 \u221d n for the two jets. We therefore search for the combination of parameters that could\nsatisfy the kinematic and light curve fitting, as well as the relationship Ke /Kw \u223cne /nw .\nB\u22a5 =\n\nTo search for the best parameters fitting the data, we follow the following procedure. With\nnumerical calculations, for the 19 data points (including 10 kinematic data and 9 light curve\ndata) we build a large 8-dimensional database for the eight parameters to be estimated, with\none constraining relationship, Ke /Kw \u223cne /nw . Intuitively it looks very difficult to determine so\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nmany parameters from so few data points. However, one approach we take is that we divide the\nfittings into two stages: we first fit the kinematic data regardless of the lightcurve information and\nget a series of (r, n) all of which describe the data almost equally well. Then, for each set of (r, n),\nwe fit the lightcurve and calculate the joint \u03c72 value to choose the group of parameters yielding the\nleast \u03c72 value. The advantage of this approach is that, since (r, n) is fixed every time in the fitting\nof the lightcurve, we consider the kinematic fittings to be independent of the lightcurve fittings in\ncalculating \u03c72 . At each search step, the total \u03c72 is calculated corresponding to the 19 data points.\nA set of parameters that yields the minimum total \u03c72 is taken as our best fitting parameters.\nThe resulting total \u03c72 is 7.05 and the errors are estimated by searching for the range for one\nparameter that can change the \u03c72 value by a given delta while keeping all the other parameters\nfixed (Press et al. 1992, \"Constant Chi-Squared Boundaries as Confidence Limits\"). The result\ncorresponding to the lightcurve fitting is shown in Fig.5 and the corresponding kinematic fitting\nis shown in panel (c) in Fig.4. The best fitting parameters are listed in Table 4. From the\nparameters, we conclude that the boundary of the cavity lies at r \u223c12 arcsec to the east and \u223c17\narcsec to the west of the central source. The corresponding number density of the ISM outside\nthis boundary is \u223c0.0034 cm\u22123 and \u223c0.12 cm\u22123 , respectively. These values are both lower than\nthe canonical ISM value of \u223c1 cm\u22123 , although the value in the western region is much higher\nthan in the eastern region. The asymmetry of the density on the both sides probably involves\nthe generation history of the cavity, which should be explored with further studies. The electron\nenergy fraction relationship is satisfied as Ke /Kw \u223cne /nw \u223c 0.03. However, we should mention\nhere that the other relation concerning the magnetic field strength (if \u01ebB are equal on the two\np\np\nsides, then Be /Bw \u221d e\u2032e /e\u2032w \u221d ne /nw ) could not be satisfied simultaneously by these parameters.\nAlthough the cavity radius and the number density are allowed to vary significantly, the best\nfitted magnetic field strength remains quite stable (\u223c0.35-0.55 mG). One possible interpretation\nfor this is that the equipartition parameter varies as the physical conditions of the jet varies or\nequipartition assumptions do not hold here for the magnetic fields since this is not a steady system;\nan alternative explanation may involve the in situ generation (or amplification) of the magnetic\nfield (e.g., originated from external ISM instead of from the jet itself).\nIn the fitting, the assumed initial Lorentz factor is \u03930 = 3, indicating an initial velocity of\nv \u223c 0.943c. The fixed spectral index, p = 2.2, is consistent with the value obtained by Xue et al.\n(2008) in their broadband spectral analysis (p \u223c 2.20 \u2212 2.31). The fitted magnetic field strengths\nis lower than the value given by Xue et al. (2008) (B \u223c 1 \u2212 32 mG). However, they claimed a large\nuncertainty in their fittings. We look forward to further analysis to explore this more clearly and\ntake our fitting as a reasonable one at this stage.\n\n5.\n\nANALYSIS OF JETS IN H1743-322\n\nH 1743-322 is an X-ray transient first discovered in 1977 (Kaluzienski & Holt 1977).

New activity was found by INTEGRAL in 2003 (Revnivtsev et al. 2003), and\na bright radio flare was observed by VLA on 2003 April 8 (Rupen et al. 2003). Chandra X-ray\nand ATCA radio observations from 2003 November to 2004 June revealed the presence of largescale jets on both sides (Rupen et al. 2004; Corbel et al. 2005). The source is then labeled as a\n\"microquasar\".\nWe take the data from the work of Corbel et al. (2005) and fit the proper motion with the\nexternal shock model. Following their approach, the ejection date is set to the time of the major\nradio flare (2003 April 8). The distance to H 1743-322 is basically unknown now. However, its\nlocation toward the Galactic bulge could possibly imply a Galactic center location. Assuming a\nsource distance of 8 kpc (distance to the Galactic center), the first radio detection of the jets gives\nout an intrinsic velocity of the ejection of \u03b2 = v/c = 0.79 and an angle of \u03b8 = 73o for the axis of\nthe jets (Corbel et al. 2005).\nHowever, the evolution of the jets shows that the velocity is not constant all the way through.\nDeceleration is required since the linear extrapolation of the proper motion data yields an ejection\ndate earlier than the chosen zero point time, as shown in panel (a) in Fig. 6. The linear extrapolation of the zero point and the first data point also gives out lines with steeper slope than the real\ndata.\nAs a result, we also apply the external shock model to this source. The line of sight angle is\nset to be \u03b8 = 73o in all fittings. It is worth mentioning that the 73 degree angle is only valid if\nthe jets have both been propagating outwards with the same speed and the same angle to the line\nof sight and the source is assumed to be located at the Galactic center with a distance of 8 kpc.\nHowever, since there are no better constraints on the jet orientation, we simply take this value as a\nreasonable approximation. We first test the model that assumes the source located in a continual\ngas medium. In this case, the jets would decelerate gradually after ejection. The model fits the\ndata quite well this time (panel (b) in Fig.6, with \u03c72 =1.03 for the approaching jet and \u03c72 =0.98 for\nthe receding jet, with degree of freedom=2 for each case), indicating that a cavity is not required\nin this source. However, we also notice that the best fitting density of the environment ISM is\nn \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 , much lower than the canonical Galactic ISM value. We also apply the cavity\nmodel to the fitting, which describes the data equally well (panel (c) in Fig. 6, with \u03c72 =0.95 for\nthe approaching and \u03c72 =0.97 for the receding jet, with degree of freedom=2 for each case), with a\ncavity region with radius of 3 arcsec on both sides and the gas density of n \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123 . This\nvalue is one magnitude higher than the previous attempt, but still quite low. Due to the limited\ndata, we cannot test if the environment outside the central source is symmetric or not. The flux is\nnot fitted for this source because of the limited number of X-ray data points.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 6.- Model fittings to the proper motion of the radio and X-ray jets of H 1743-322.

We could further argue that the low density of the environment is a necessary\nrequirement for the jet to develop to a long distance.\nHeinz (2002) derived the scale relations for the jets from accreting black holes, using a simple\nanalytic model. He adopted the jet-ISM interaction scenario to estimate the slow-down distance of\nthe ejecta:\ndslow \u223c 1016 cm(E44 /\u039325 nx \u03b852 )1/3 ,\n(11)\nwhere Ekin \u2261 1044 E44 erg is the kinetic energy, \u03935 \u2261 \u0393/5 is the Lorentz factor of the jet, nx is the\nexternal gas density in the unit of cm\u22123 and \u03b8 = 5o \u03b85 is the opening angle of the jet. He applied\nthis estimation to microquasars GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. In both cases, he found that\nthe upper limit on the gas density is roughly 10\u22123 cm\u22123 , given dslow of 0.05pc, quite consistent\nwith the ISM density found for XTE J1550-564 and H1743-322 in this work. For a larger dslow , a\nlower nx should be required.\nHeinz's approach led to an interesting comparison between the microquasar jets and the radio\nquasar jets. He claimed that the jets length in GRS 1915+105 (l >0.04 pc) would correspond to a\njet length of 4 Mpc when scaled by M (mass of the central black hole) to AGN conditions (such as\nM87 or Cyg A) (2002). We could follow this way and infer that the jet in XTE J1550-564 (l >0.5\npc) will correspond to a 50 Mpc long AGN jet, which has never been detected. This again confirms\nthat the environment of microquasars should be comparatively vacuous, in a dynamical sense\neven (although not in the absolute sense) less dense than the AGN environment (the intergalactic\nmedium of densities between 10\u22125 cm\u22123 to 10\u22122 cm\u22123 ), when compared to the thrust of the jets\nin microquasars and AGNs. When presented in unit of pc with the information of source distance\nand scaled by the central black hole mass, the proper motions of different microquasar jets can be\nplotted in one figure (Fig. 7) (GRS 1915+105: 14\u00b14 M\u2299 (Greiner et al. 2001), 12.5 kpc (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\net al. 1995); GX 339-4: 5.8\u00b10.5 M\u2299 (Hynes et al. 2003), lower limit estimation of distance of 4 kpc\n(Zdziarski et al. 1998); XTE J1550-564: 10.5\u00b11.0 M\u2299 and 5.3 kpc (Orosz et al. 2002); H 1743-322:\nsince no good mass and distance observation up to date, we follow the assumption of 10 M\u2299 (Miller\net al. 2006) and galactic center origin of 8 kpc (Corbel et al. 2005)). It is interesting to notice from\nthis figure that although the detailed properties of the binary systems (e.g., the compact objects\nand the companion stars) differ a lot from source to source, the normalized jet proper motions\nare quite consistent. This is not surprising since the jet properties are set by the compact object\n(and its immediate neighborhood) and their evolutions are mostly influenced by the surrounding\nenvironment. Although the companion star provides the material which is eventually launched into\nthe jets, and thus affects the mass transfer rate and the mass flux in the jets, it nevertheless does\nnot seem to play significant roles for the structure and evolution of the large scale jets and cavities\nsurrounding the microquasar. Therefore the nature of accretion disk physics dominates over the\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nnurture of the companion star, as far as the jets are concerned. Thus it leads us to the attempt to\ngeneralize the microquasar jets in one consistent picture.\nThis figure, together with other observational data concerning the motionless large scale jets\n(e.g., Cyg X-1, SS433), has led us to the suggestion that all microquasar jets can be classified into\nroughly three groups: small scale moving jets, large scale moving jets and large scale jet relics. For\nthe first type, the \"small jets\", only radio emissions are detected. The jets are always relatively\nclose to the central source and dissipate very quickly. Examples of this class include GRS 1915+105\n(Rodr\u0131\u0301guez & Mirabel 1999; Miller-Jones et al. 2007), GRO J1655-40 (Hjellming & Rupen 1995),\nand Cyg X-3 (Mart\u0131\u0301 et al. 2001). The typical spatial scale is 0\u223c0.05 pc and the time scale is several\ntens of days. In this class, no obvious deceleration is observed before the jets become too faint.\nFor the second type, the \"large jets\", both X-ray and radio detections are obtained, at a place far\nfrom the central source several years after the outburst. Examples are XTE J1550-564, H1743-322,\nand GX 339-4 (Gallo et al. 2004). The typical jet traveling distance for this type is 0.2\u223c0.5 pc\nfrom the central engine. Deceleration is clearly observed in this type of sources. The last type, the\n\"large relics\", is a kind of diffuse structures observed in radio, optical and X-ray band, often ring\nor round nebula shaped that are not moving at all. In this class, some well studied sources, Cygnus\nX-1 (Gallo et al. 2005), SS433 (Dubner el al. 1998), Circinus X-1 (Stewart et al. 1993, Tudose et\nal. 2006) and GRS 1915+105 (Kaiser et al. 2004) are included. The typical scale for this kind is\n1\u223c30 pc, an order of magnitude larger than the second type. The estimated lifetime often exceeds\none million years, indicating that they are related to previous outbursts.\nFrom these properties, it is reasonable to further suggest a consistent picture involving all the\nsources together. We make a conjecture that extreme low density regions, or namely, large scale\ncavities, exist in all microquasar systems. The \"small jets\" observed right after the ejection are\njust traveling through these cavities. Since there are few or none interactions between the jets\nand the surrounding gas in this region, the jets travel without obvious deceleration. The emission\nmechanism is synchrotron radiation by particles accelerated in the initial outburst. The emissions\nof jets decay very quickly and are not detectable after several tens of days. In some cases (e.g.\nXTE J1550-564), the cavity has a dense (compared to the cavity) boundary at some radius and\nthe interactions between the jets and the boundary gas heat the particles again and thus make the\njets detectable again. Those are the \"large jets\". The emission mechanism then is synchrotron\nradiation by the re-heated particles in the external shocks. Then, after these interactions, the jets\nlost most of their kinematic energy into the ISM gradually, causing the latter to expand to large\nscale structures, the \"large relics\", in a comparatively long time (thousands to several millions of\nyears) and create the observed nebula-like jet-inflated bubbles.\nDifferent systems are allowed to fall into more than one of the three postulated groups. For\nexample, Cygnus X-1 has small-scale ejecta (Fender et al., 2006) and also has a large-scale relic\n(Gallo et al., 2005). Also XTE J1550-564 has small-scale ejecta (Hannikainen et al., 2001) and\nalso large-scale jets (Corbel et al., 2002). As we proposed in the above paragraph, the three\nobservational groups are perhaps just three stages in a complete ejection evolution process: the\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\"small jets\" observed in the outburst events will travel in dark and manifest themselves as the\n\"large jets\" when they hit the boundary of the cavity and eventually develop into the \"large relics\"\ngradually by the continuous interactions and energy dissipation. If this conjecture holds, then the\nthree groups may not be actually \"three\" but just three phenomena in \"one\" system. The three\ngroups identified here are probably just observational manifestations of one generic mechanism,\nand different sources can belong to multiple groups.\nIf this general model of microquasars is true, properties of different jet systems could be dealt\nwith separately in one consistent scheme. One implication is that the electrons from the \"large\njet\" and the \"small jets\" belong to different groups of electrons, from the ejecta itself and the ISM\nrespectively, which means we could not simply use the properties of electron distributions in the\n\"large jet\" blobs to determine the emission properties of the central source in the ejection (Xue et\nal. 2008).\nOne important remaining question would be why there are such vacuous regions and how to\ngenerate them. There are several possibilities, involving previous outbursts, jets or winds activities.\nBefore we go further into these possibilities, we should first distinguish one class from the others.\nWe have used the term \"cavity\" all through our discussion, but actually there are two geometric\npossibilities for a cavity. One is a \"cavity\", the other is a \"tunnel\". Instead of a spherical cavity, it\nis possible that there is only a vacuum conical path outside the central engine. It may be created by\nprevious jet ejection events and got fully developed through a series of ejections. This could explain\nthe collimation of the jets naturally, but it requires almost continuous jet ejections (contrary to the\nepisodic jet ejections discussed here) to prevent the surrounding gas to fall back and fill up the thin\npath between ejections.\nThis assumption is of great interest because it provides a possible connection between the\nlarge-scale structures and the persistent, low-power, steady jets reported in several important observations (etc. Cyg X-1 (Stirling et al. 2001) and GRS 1915+105 (Dhawan et al. 2000)). Kaiser\nand Alexander (1997, hereafter KA97) has developed a model for radio galaxies in which continuous and collimated jet may clear its way out and create a hot spot at the end of its path, and\nthe hot electrons escaped from the shocks would form a \"cocoon\" outside the central compact\nobject. If this is also the case for Galactic accretion systems, as postulated for Cygnus X-1 (Gallo\net al., 2005), Circinus X-1 (Tudose et al., 2006), and GRS 1915+105 (Kaiser et al., 2004), then\nthe vacuous regions (tunnel and cocoon) and the \"large relics\" are perhaps both the results of the\ncontinuous jets traveling in dark. The two Galactic center sources 1E1740-294 and GRS 1958-258\nmay also belong to this case. In this frame of assumptions, the episodic outbursts are not included\nhere: the outbursts will increase the instantaneous mass flux down the jet, however since low-mass\nX-ray binaries spend the majority of their time in a low-luminosity quiescent state, the outbursts\nwill have little effect on the time-averaged jet luminosity, and thus on the long-term evolution of\nthe relics. However, we may infer that if there are dark continuous jets and dark relics in a system\nlike XTE J1550-564, a strong episodic outburst would just hit and brighten the boundary of the\nrelic and may provide a bridge between the source and the relic. If there are multiple outbursts,\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nwe will expect repeated \"large jets\" in the same direction with larger and larger lengths. Future\nobservations would then be able to testify this possibility.\nApart from this case, several other possibilities may take place. One possible way to create the observed cavities is through recent supernovae outbursts that produced the central black\nholes. However, only HMXBs should be close to their parent supernova remnants (being young);\naccumulated velocity dispersion (scattering from spiral arms or giant molecular clouds over time)\nwill carry LMXBs far from their natal supernova remnant in a few Galactic orbits, e.g. for GRO\nJ1655-40 (Israelian et al. 1999). Furthermore, some sources such as Cygnus X-1 most likely never\nhad supernovae, because of their low peculiar velocity (Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u0301gues 2003). In the case of\nrecent supernovae (< 105 years) and low kick-out velocity for the black hole, SNRs surrounding\nthem should have been detected, and for much older supernovae and very low kick-out velocity\nfor the black hole, the microquasars may still resides in the SNRs but regular interstellar medium\nshould have filled those very old SNRs now.\nWinds from progenitors of the central compact objects at their last stages may also be an\ninterpretation. Cavities in hydrogen maps have been detected around neutron stars and were\nsupposed to be driven by wind from the progenitors of the stars (Gaensler et al. 2005). However,\nthe lifetime of such bubbles were estimated to be of order of \u223c1 Myrs. For a region still as vacuous\nas we have estimated in our studies, the compact object is expected to be much younger than that.\nWinds of the companion star in the binary are also a possible candidate. Wind-blown bubbles and\nshells are observed around evolved massive stars, with typical radii of \u223c2-10 pc for Wolf-Rayet stars\n(Gruendl et al. 2000) and \u223c0.1-2.3 pc for luminous blue supergiants (Smith et al. 2007). However,\nthe estimated density at the bubble shells is of order of \u223c100 cm\u22123 , simply too high for our case,\nand among all the well established microquasar systems, only the companion star in Cyg X-1 is O\ntype (O9.7Iab) (Remillard & McClintock 2006), whereas most of the other systems contain only M,\nK or G type companion stars, which are not powerful enough to generate such large scale bubbles.\nA plausible possibility involves the accretion disk winds. In this scenario, it is the disk winds\nwith mild or non-relativistic velocities that have pushed away the surrounding ISM gas and created\nthe low density regions surrounding the central source. The wind should go as shells that travel\nin a ballistic way while interacting with the ISM cold gas. Indeed, in several microquasars, fast\nionized winds have already been observed (Miller et al. 2006; Kotani et al. 2000; Netzer, 2006; Sala\net al. 2006; Fuchs et al. 2006). Strong absorption metal lines are detected with obvious blueshift.\nThe speed of the outflow could be calculated from the blueshift of these lines. The ejection place\ncould also be estimated using the measured ionization parameters. We list some of the results in\nTable 5, including the calculated escape velocity at the inferred ejection radius (rg = GMBH /c2\np\np\nand vesc (r) = 2GMBH /r = 2rg c2 /r). Also, in another interesting work, Fuchs et al. (2006)\nshowed that there are indeed strong subrelativistic winds coming out of the SS 433 system, very\nmuch alike the winds from a WR star or from a thick torus or envelope outside the accretion disk\nand the central object. The estimated mass lost rate is 4.7 \u2212 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for discontinuous\nwinds and 3 times higher for continuous winds, much higher than the observed jet mass loss of\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n0.09\n\nJet length/BH mass (pc/M Sun )\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n\nH1743-322\nGRS1915+105\nGX339-4\nXTE J1550-564\n\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n800\n1000\nTime after outburst (days)\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nFig. 7.- Normalized proper motions of microquasars' approaching jets, obtained by dividing the\nactual jet length by the central compact object mass.

These\ninferences are also supported by Blundell et al. (2001), where the equatorial radio emission seen in\nSS433 was taken as evidence for a disc wind. These observations support the idea of co-existence\nof jets and winds in the microquasars systems. We also notice that the wind velocity in H1743-322\nis lower than those in GRS 1915 +105 and GRO J1655-40, suggesting larger cavities are formed for\nthe latter two sources than for the former one. It is consistent with the fact that no decelerating\njets have been observed in these two sources up to now.\nHowever, whether the winds are powerful enough to create such large cavities in all cases for\nall sources is unclear at this stage. The terminal places of the wind shells (which determine the\nsize of the cavity) are determined by the wind energy and geometry, specifically, the wind velocity\nat the ejection place and the opening angle, and the interaction conditions between winds and the\ngas. These parameters are still very uncertain nowadays because of the lack of enough studies and\nthe densities of the winds are only estimated at the foot of the ejection place. We would roughly\nestimate that, in order for the wind to move to large radii far from the black hole, the wind velocity\nshould be quite close to the escape velocity at the ejection radius. From table 5, we can see that\nmost of the observed wind velocities are comparable to, although not as large as, the local escape\nvelocity, with the exception of the recently discovered disk wind of about its escape velocity in GRS\n1915+105 in its soft state, with mass loss rate sufficient to suppress jet ejection (Neilsen & Lee\n2009). Therefore in the last case the accretion disk wind alone (because no jet is expected in the\nsoft state) may play a significant role for forming a large scale cavity. However for other cases the\nwinds alone may not be enough to power the cavities, due to insufficient velocities.\nTherefore some kinds of acceleration or velocity-maintaining mechanisms may be required,\nin order for the winds to expand far enough (\u223c0.1 pc to 10 pc). Magnetic fields may play an\nimportant role here. It has been known that rotating wind-up magnetic fields can accelerate and\nlaunch jets (see Spruit 2008 and references therein); therefore continuous high velocity winds can\nset up the favorable condition for producing continuous outflows or jets with velocities around or\neven exceeding the escaping velocities of these systems. Once continuous high velocity outflows\nor jets are produced, they should be able to inflate their surrounding interstellar medium to form\nbubbles, as we have discussed earlier within the framework of the KA97 model.\nFinally, we comment that it seems counter intuitive that the boundary of the cavity lies further\nin the western side, yet the ISM density is also higher in the west. It would be a problem if the\ncavity is produced by the observed large scale two-sided jets with equal power. Therefore this\nasymmetry may be used to argue against such a model. However, the asymmetric cavity may be\nnaturally produced if the system has a non-negligible space velocity with respect to the local ISM\nalong the eastern direction. In this case additional energy is injected into the ISM on the head-on\nside along the direction of motion of the system, in analogy to process producing the head-on bowshock of young spin-down powered pulsars moving in ISM (e.g., Caraveo et al 2003). Therefore the\ncavity on the approaching side should be emptier (with smaller density) than the opposite wind or\njet, unless the system moves perpendicular to the wind or jet. The system itself is also catching up\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nwith the cavity on the approaching side, placing itself closer to the boundary of the cavity on the\napproaching side. For example, a space velocity of 100 km/s with respect to the local ISM would\ndisplace the source by 0.1 pc in less than 1000 years. In the absence of data for this system on\nits proper motion and the power of wind or continuous (dark) jets, we will not speculate further\non what combination of parameters may eventually produce the observed asymmetry of the cavity.\nThis should be tested in the future. Heinz et al. (2008) have proposed that the microquasar's\nspace velocity should be important and leave trails behind their moving path in the Galaxy. They\nestimated the volume of radio plasma released by these microquasars and claimed that they should\nbe observable at low frequencies. Future observational confirmation of their prediction for XTE\nJ1550-564 would provide evidence for our conjecture.\n\n7.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nTwo large-scale X-ray jets have been observed in XTE J1550-564. We have analyzed the\nChandra X-ray data for these two jets and fitted their kinematics and light curves with the external\nshock model in the GRB afterglow model. In this model, the interactions between the jet material\nand the surrounding ISM slow the jets down and accelerate the jet particles to radiate the observed\nradio and X-ray synchrotron radiations. Under such assumptions, the number density of the ISM\nin the surrounding regions of the central black hole is a key parameter. We found in the fitting\nthat this number density has to be extremely low, or the strong interactions would block the jet's\nexpansion. However on the other hand, the number density at \u223c20 arcsec has to be comparatively\nhigh (but still lower than the typical ISM) in order to allow the jet to be decelerated quickly, as\nthe observational data indicated. Thus, a model consisting of two different regions, a cavity and\nits gas boundaries, is tested and shown to work well. The cavity is found to be large scale (\u223c0.4\npc in size) and asymmetric (ne /nw \u223c 0.03). The reason of the asymmetry of the environment on\nthe two sides is not clear from current observational data. The deceleration described in the model\nis quite obvious (from \u03930 = 3 to \u0393t \u2243 1 at t \u223c 1500 days), thus it is the first time that we observe\nthe whole process of the deceleration of a pair of relativistic jets.\nThe similar analysis of H1743-322 also supports this jet-ISM interaction scenario. Large scale\ndecelerating jets are also observed in this source and the interaction model describes the data\nconsistently. Whether a cavity exists is not clear in this case; nevertheless the density is also found\nto be very low, compared to the canonical Galactic value.\nWith these studies, a generic model of the environment of microquasars is proposed. We\nsuggest that microquasars are located in large scale and very low density cavities. The cavity\nprovides the space for the jets to go through freely and the interactions between the jets and the\nmaterial outside the cavity provide the deceleration mechanism of the jets. The cavity is likely\ncreated by continuous high velocity outflows or jets, which are seeded by accretion disk winds that\nhave been observed in several microquasar systems producing strong absorption lines.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nMicroquasars are powerful probes of both the central engine and their surrounding environment. More studies of the jets behaviors may give us information on the ISM gas properties, as\nwell as the ejecta components. The link between jets and wind is a key issue in current studies\nof accreting systems. If the general scenario we have proposed here is further confirmed, we then\nneed to understand the mechanism producing these outflows (winds and jets) and the connections\nbetween them. Detailed analysis of the geometry and timing properties of the ejecta in the future\nwould be of great significance; it will not only provide insights of the jet formation process, but\nalso offer another approach into black hole physics and accretion flow dynamics.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to X.Y.
