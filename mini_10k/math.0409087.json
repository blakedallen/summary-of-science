In this article,\nwe prove that the commutator of xm and y n is a product of two squares if\nand only if mn is even. We also show using topological methods that there\nare infinitely many obstructions for an element in F2 to be a product of\ntwo squares.\nAMS Classification 20F12; 57M07\nKeywords Commutators, free groups, products of commutators\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn any group G, the commutator of two elements g and h is a product of three\nsquares, namely,\n\u00012\nghg\u22121 h\u22121 = g2 g\u22121 h h\u22122 .\nLet [g, h] denote the commutator of g and h. It is natural to ask whether [g, h]\ncan be written as a product two squares. Since the subgroup generated by g and\nh in G is a quotient of the free group on two generators, the answer would be\nin the affirmative if we knew that the commutator of the generators of the free\ngroup on two generators can be written as a product of two squares. However,\nif F2 is the free group on two generators x and y , a theorem of Lyndon and\nNewman [2] states that the commutator [x, y] is not a product of two squares.\nHere, we give the following generalisation of their theorem. Further, the method\nof our proof extends to give infinitely many obstructions to an element being\nthe product of two squares.\nTheorem 1.1 [xm , y n ] is a product of two squares in F2 = hx, yi if and only\nif mn is even.\nIn the case when m = n = 1 this gives the theorem of Lyndon and Newman.\nOur methods also give a proof of the following theorem of Akhavan-Malayeri [1].\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\fSucharit Sarkar\n\n596\n\nTheorem 1.2 (Akhavan-Malayeri) [x, y]2n+1 is not a product of two squares\nin F2 = hx, yi.\nWe first reformulate the question in terms of products of conjugate elements.\nLemma 1.3 An element g \u2208 F2 can be expressed as a product g = a2 b2 of\ntwo squares if and only if g can be expressed as a product g = c(d\u22121 cd) of two\nconjugate elements.\nProof This follows immediately from the relation a2 b2 = (ab)(b\u22121 (ab)b).\nThe following statement underlines the importance of the previous lemma.\nLemma 1.4 Suppose g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] is of the form g = ab with a and b conjugate\nin F2 . Then a, b \u2208 [F2 , F2 ].\nProof Let g 7\u2192 \u1e21 be the abelianisation homomorphism F2 \u2192 Z2 . Then as\ng \u2208 [F2 , F2 ], 0 = \u1e21 = \u0101 + b\u0304 = 2\u0101 where the last equality holds as a and b are\nconjugate. Thus, \u0101 = b\u0304 = 0 which implies that a, b \u2208 [F2 , F2 ].\nThe heart of our proof lies in constructing a group homomorphism \u03c6 : [F2 , F2 ] \u2192\nZ which is invariant under conjugacy action of F2 , i.e., \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(g\u22121 ag) for all\na \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] and g \u2208 F2 . The construction of our homomorphism is topological.\nIf an element g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] is a product of two squares, then we shall see that\n\u03c6(g) is even. This gives a criterion to decide whether g is the product of two\nsquares. The theorem of Lyndon and Newman follows from this. We shall\nextend this to stronger criteria for an element in [F2 , F2 ] to be a product of two\nsquares.\n\n2\n\nThe homomorphism \u03c6\n\nWe construct a homomorphism \u03c6 : [F2 , F2 ] \u2192 Z which is invariant under the\nconjugacy action of F2 . The theorem of Lyndon and Newman follows from the\nproperties of this homomorphism.\nLet K be the wedge of two circles. Then \u03c01 (K) = F2 . Let K\u0303 be the universal\nabelian cover of K . This is the cover corresponding to the subgroup [F2 , F2 ]\nof F2 . We can identify K\u0303 with a subcomplex of R2 whose vertices are Z2 and\nedges join (i, j) either to (i + 1, j) or to (i, j + 1).\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fCommutators and squares in free groups\n\n597\n\nLet X and Y denote the edges from (0, 0) to (1, 0) and (0, 1) respectively.\nUnder the group Z2 of deck transformations each edge is the image of X or Y .\nDenoting the group of deck transformations multiplicatively and taking x and\ny to be the generators, we see that all edges are of the form xi y j X or xi y j Y\nwith i, j \u2208 Z.\nConsider the simplicial homology of K\u0303 . We shall first define a homomorphism\n\u03b8 : Z1 (K\u0303) \u2192 Z from the 1-cycles to the integers which is invariant under deck\ntransformations. The homomorphism \u03c6 will be defined in terms of this.\nObserve that, using the above notation, the simplicial chains of K\u0303 are of the\nform \u03b1 = P\u03b1 (x, y)X + Q\u03b1 (x, y)Y with P\u03b1 (x, y) and Q\u03b1 (x, y) Laurent polynomials. Let f\u03b1(y) = P\u03b1 (1, y). The action by a deck transformation xk y l takes\n\u03b1 = P\u03b1 (x, y)X + Q\u03b1 (x, y)Y to xk y l \u03b1 = xk y l P\u03b1 (x, y)X + xk y l Q\u03b1 (x, y)Y .\nFurther, for a cycle \u03b1, it is easy to see that f\u03b1 (1) = P\u03b1 (1, 1) = 0. We define\nthe homomorphism \u03b8 by\n\u03b8(\u03b1) = f\u03b1\u2032 (1).\nLemma 2.1 \u03b8 : Z1 (K\u0303) = H1 (K\u0303) \u2192 Z is invariant under the group of deck\ntransformations.\nProof It suffices to show that \u03b8(x\u03b1) = \u03b8(\u03b1) = \u03b8(y\u03b1). The first equality is\nobvious as fx\u03b1 = f\u03b1 . The second follows as\n\u2032\nfy\u03b1\n(1) = (yf\u03b1 )\u2032 (1) = f\u03b1 (1) + f\u03b1\u2032 (1) = f\u03b1\u2032 (1).\n\nHere we used the fact that for a cycle f\u03b1 (1) = 0.\nAs K\u0303 is a 1-complex, this can be viewed as a homomorphism, also denoted\n\u03b8 , from H1 (K\u0303) to Z. Using this, we define \u03c6 : [F2 , F2 ] \u2192 Z. Namely, given a\ncurve \u03b3 in K representing an element g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ], take a lift \u03b3\u0303 of \u03b3 to K\u0303 . This\nrepresents an element in homology, and we let \u03c6(g) = \u03b8(\u03b3\u0303). This is independent\nof the lift chosen as different lifts are related by deck transformation, and \u03b8 is\ninvariant under deck transformations.\nWe need some properties of \u03c6.\nLemma 2.2 \u03c6(g) = \u03c6(hgh\u22121 ) for all g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] and h \u2208 F2 .\nProof The elements of g and hgh\u22121 of [F2 , F2 ] can be represented by curves\nthat have lifts in K\u0303 that differ by deck transformations. As deck transformations leave \u03b8 invariant, \u03c6(g) = \u03c6(hgh\u22121 ).\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fSucharit Sarkar\n\n598\n\nLemma 2.3 Suppose g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] is a product of two squares. Then \u03c6(g) is\neven.\nProof By Lemma 1.3 we can write g = hk with h and k elements of [F2 , F2 ]\nthat are conjugate in F2 . We have \u03c6(g) = \u03c6(h)+\u03c6(k) = 2\u03c6(h) as \u03c6 is invariant\nunder conjugation.\nConsider the lift to K\u0303 of a curve \u03b3 representing [x, y] in K . This lift gives\nthe cycle \u03b1 = (1 \u2212 y)X + (x \u2212 1)Y and, hence \u03c6([x, y]) = f\u03b1\u2032 (1) = \u22121. Thus,\n\u03c6 is non-trivial. Moreover, by the above lemma [x, y] is not a product of two\nsquares.\nWe now prove our extension of the result of Lyndon and Newman, one half of\nwhich is an extension of the above argument.\nProof of Theorem 1.1 Take a curve \u03b3 representing [xm , y n ]. We see that\nthe lift of this starting at the origin gives the chain\n\u03b1 = (1 + x + . . . xm\u22121 )(1 \u2212 y n )X + (1 + y + * * * + y n\u22121 )(xm \u2212 1)Y\nand hence \u03c6([xm , y n ]) = \u2212mn. Hence if [xm , y n ] is the product of two squares,\nmn is even.\nConversely, if mn is even, we assume without loss of generality that m is even.\n\u2212m\nm\nThen [xm , y n ] = (x 2 )2 (y n x 2 y \u2212n )2 .\nThe same methods also yield a proof of Theorem 1.2 of Akhavan-Malayeri. We\nthank the referee for pointing this out.\nProof of Theorem 1.2 By the above, \u03c6([x, y]2n+1 ) = \u2212(2n + 1) as \u03c6 is a\nhomomorphism. The result follows.\nWe have constructed a homomorphism \u03c6 on [F2 , F2 ] that is invariant under\nconjugacy. Now [F2 , F2 ] is the smallest normal subgroup of F2 containing\n[x, y]. Therefore, any such homomorphism is determined by its value on [x, y].\nIn particular, if we make the analogous construction taking g(x) = Q\u03b1 (x, 1)\nin place of f (y) and define \u03c8(\u03b1) = g\u2032 (1), we have \u03c8 = \u2212\u03c6 as we can see by\nevaluating on [x, y].\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fCommutators and squares in free groups\n\n3\n\n599\n\nFurther criteria\n\nSo far we have one criterion for an element in [F2 , F2 ] to be a product of two\nsquares, namely, if g is a product of two squares then \u03c6(g) is even. If \u03c6(g) = 0\n(which implies \u03c8(g) = 0), there are other criteria. These are obtained by\nconstructing homomorphisms \u03c62 and \u03c82 on appropriate subgroups of G =\n[F2 , F2 ] which are even on elements that are products of two squares.\nWe first need some lemmas. Let G1 denote the kernel of \u03c6. Since \u03c6 is conjugacy\ninvariant, G1 is a normal subgroup of F2 . Let H1 = ker(\u03c8) = G1 .\nLemma 3.1 Suppose \u03c6(g) = 0 and g = ab with a and b conjugate. Then\na, b \u2208 G1 .\nProof As \u03c6 is conjugacy invariant, 0 = \u03c6(g) = 2\u03c6(a).\nWe need an elementary property of derivatives of polynomials.\nLemma 3.2 Let f (t) be a Laurent polynomial with integer coefficients. Then\nf k (t) is divisible by k!.\nProof The k th derivative of tn is divisible by n(n \u2212 1) * * * (n \u2212 k + 1) which\nin turn is divisible by k!. The result follows.\nNow we can define two homomorphisms \u03c62 and \u03c82 from H1 = G1 to Z by\n\u03c62 (g) = f\u03b1\u2032\u2032 (1)/2 and \u03c82 = g\u03b1\u2032\u2032 (1)/2 with \u03b1 as before. The proof that these are\nwell defined and conjugacy invariant is exactly as in the previous section.\nContinuing in this manner, we let G2 = ker(\u03c62 ) and H2 = ker(\u03c82 ). We\ninductively define groups Hk and Gk and homomorphisms \u03c6k : Gk\u22121 \u2192 Z and\n(k)\n(k)\n\u03c8k : Hk\u22121 \u2192 Z. Namely, let \u03c6k (\u03b1) = f\u03b1 (1)/k! and \u03c8k (\u03b1) = g\u03b1 (1)/k! and\ndefine Gk = ker(\u03c6k ) and Hk = ker(\u03c8k ).\nAs in the previous section, we deduce the following properties of the homomorphisms \u03c6k and \u03c8k .\nLemma 3.3 The homomorphisms \u03c6k and \u03c8k are invariant under the action\nof F2 by conjugation.\nLemma 3.4 If g \u2208 Gk (respectively g \u2208 Hk ) is a product of two squares, then\n\u03c6k (g) (respectively \u03c8k ) is even.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fSucharit Sarkar\n\n600\n\nThus, we have infinitely many obstructions to an element being the product\nof two squares. More precisely, let g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] be an element. We evaluate\n\u03c6(g) = \u2212\u03c8(g). There are three possibilities: \u03c6(g) = 0, \u03c6(g) is even or \u03c6(g) is\nodd. In case \u03c6(g) is odd, we know that g is not a square. If it is even but nonzero, we cannot deduce any further obstructions. In the case when \u03c6(g) = 0,\nwe have additional homomorphisms \u03c62 and \u03c82 which can be applied to g to\nget an odd or even number. This process can be continued inductively.\n\n4\n\nSome examples\n\nWe have constructed in the previous section two sequences of obstructions to\nan element g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] being a product of two squares, based on the homomorphisms \u03c6k and \u03c8k . We shall show that all these are non-trivial in the sense\nthat there are elements for which the first k \u2212 1 homomorphisms vanish and\nthe k th is odd.\nOn the other hand, in the case when f (y) = 0 and g(x) = 0 as polynomials, all\nour homomorphisms vanish. We shall construct examples where this happens.\nOur examples are based on the observation that the associations \u03b3 \u2192 P\u03b3 and\n\u03b3 \u2192 Q\u03b3 are module homomorphisms over the ring of Laurent polynomials in\nvariables x and y , from H1 (K\u0303) to Laurent polynomials. Further, we have a\nsurjection from the commutator subgroup [F2 , F2 ] = \u03c01 (K\u0303) to its abelianisation\nH1 (K\u0303).\nProposition 4.1 For any k > 1, there is an element g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] such that\n\u03c6j (g) = 0 for all j < k , \u03c6k (g) = \u22121 and \u03c8j (g) = 0 for all j .\nProof Let g be an element whose image in H1 (K\u0303) is \u03b3 = (y \u2212 1)k\u22121 \u03b1, where\n\u03b1 denotes the class of [x, y] in H1 (K\u0303). As P\u03b1 = \u2212(y \u2212 1), and the associations\n\u03b3 \u2192 P\u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2192 Q\u03b3 are module homomorphisms, it follows that P\u03b3 = \u2212(y\u22121)k\nand Q\u03b3 = (y \u2212 1)k\u22121 (x \u2212 1).\nNow f\u03b3 (y) = P\u03b3 (1, y) = \u2212(y \u2212 1)k and g\u03b3 (x) = Q\u03b3 (x, 1) = 0 and hence\n\u03c6j (g) = 0 for all j < k , \u03c6k (g) = \u22121 and \u03c8j (g) = 0 for all j .\nRecall that we consider succesively the homorphisms \u03c6k (and \u03c8k ), with \u03c6k+1\ndefined if \u03c6k vanishes. The first non-zero \u03c6k gives a criterion for an element\nbeing the product of two squares. We see in the next example that there are\nelements in [F2 , F2 ] for which all the \u03c6k vanish.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fCommutators and squares in free groups\n\n601\n\nProposition 4.2 There is an element g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] such that \u03c6j (g) = 0 =\n\u03c8j (g), for all j .\nProof We take g whose image in H1 (K\u0303) is \u03b3 = (x \u2212 1)(y \u2212 1)\u03b1. Then, using\nthe notation of the above proposition, we see that f\u03b3 (y) = 0 and g\u03b3 (x) = 0,\nand hence \u03c6j (g) = 0 = \u03c8j (g), for all j .\n\n5\n\nFactorisation and another criterion\n\nThe above example suggests a variant of our criteria.\nProposition 5.1 Let g \u2208 [F2 , F2 ] be an element with \u03b1 the corresponding\ncycle in H1 (K\u0303). Suppose (x\u22121)k (y \u22121)l divides P\u03b1 (x, y) with quotient h(x, y).\nIf g is a product of two squares then h(1, 1) is even.\nProof We have seen that if g is the product of two squares, it is the product\nof two conjugates c and d. Let Ab denote the abelianisation map [F2 , F2 ] \u2192\nH1 (K\u0303). Then Ab(g) = Ab(c) + Ab(d). As c and d are conjugate (in F2 ), they\ndiffer by a deck transformation of K\u0303 . Equivalently, c and d differ by the action\nby conjugation of the abelianisation F2 /[F2 , F2 ] = Z2 on the commutator subgroup [F2 , F2 ]. This action has been identified with multiplication by Laurent\npolynomials.\nHence, for some integers m, n \u2208 Z, we have Ab(d) = xm y n Ab(c). It follows\nthat Ab(g) = (xm y n + 1)Ab(c) and hence (1 + xm y n ) divides P\u03b1 .\nNow the ring of Laurent polynomials over Z in x and y is a unique factorisation\ndomain, and x \u2212 1 and y \u2212 1 are prime elements. Further, they do not divide\nE(x, y) = (1 + xm y m ) as E(1, 1) 6= 0. Thus, E(x, y) divides h(x, y). As\nE(1, 1) = 2, h(1, 1) is even.\nAcknowledgements I would like to thank S. Gadgil, S. P.
