Supported by OTKA-F 43749.\n\n1\n\n\fA brief overview of the appearing notions is as follows:\nConsider Special Relativity first. As explained in [13] in detail, one must\nmake a clear distinction between the notions of precession and rotation. On\nthe one hand, Thomas precession refers to the instantaneous angular velocity,\nwith respect to a particular inertial frame, of a gyroscope moving along an arbitrary world line. At every frame-instant the inertial frame Lorentz boosts the\ngyroscopic vector to its own space and sees the vector precess.\nThus, Thomas precession\n\u2013 makes sense for arbitrary gyroscopes with respect to arbitrary inertial\nframes,\n\u2013 is a continuous phenomenon (i.e. it makes sense at every proper time\ninstant of the gyroscope),\n\u2013 is a relative notion, i.e. the same gyroscope may show different instantaneous precessions with respect to different inertial frames.\nOn the other hand, Thomas rotation refers to the spatial rotation experienced by a gyroscope which has returned to its initial local rest frame.\nThus, Thomas rotation\n\u2013 makes sense only for 'returning' gyroscopes (i.e. for proper time instances s\nsuch that the world line r along which the gyroscope moves satisfies \u1e59(s) = \u1e59(0)),\n\u2013 is a discrete phenomenon (i.e. it makes sense only for the (usually) discrete\nset of proper time instances when the gyroscope happens to be in its initial local\nrest frame),\n\u2013 is an absolute notion, i.e. independent of who observes it (the same\nangle of Thomas rotation will be measured by all inertial frames observing the\ngyroscope).\nIn terms of any particular inertial frame one can think of Thomas rotation\nas the time-integral of instantaneous Thomas precessions (and while Thomas\nprecession, as a function of time, will differ from one inertial frame to another,\nits integral will always give the same angle: the Thomas rotation).\nConsider now General Relativity. Clearly, Thomas precession makes no sense\nhere, because it requires inertial frames (and Lorentz boosts). On the other\nhand, Thomas rotation can make sense. (Let us note here that in different spacetime models different names are given to the same phenomenon, e.g. Fokker-de\nSitter precession in Schwarzschild space, Schiff precession in Kerr space; we find\nit reasonable to use the unified terminology 'Thomas rotation' throughout this\npaper.) Since, in general, the tangent spaces at r(s) and at r(0) are different,\nThomas rotation can be meaningful only if the tangent spaces in question are\nidentified somehow, and \u1e59(s) = \u1e59(0) under this identification. (One also expects\nthe identification to be 'natural' from a physical point of view; mathematically\nit is not important. In special relativity this 'natural' identification is simply\nthe identity map, as the tangent spaces are the same.) Such identification is\npossible e.g. by the Lie transport corresponding to a Killing vector.\nSuch a situation is considered in [18] where rotating coordinates are suggested for calculating the Thomas rotation angle on a circular orbit. The principle in that paper is that, heuristically, the gyroscope keeps direction in itself,\n\n2\n\n\ftherefore if a rotating reference frame co-moving with the gyroscope has instantaneous angular velocity \u03a9, then it will see the gyroscope precess with angular\nvelocity \u2212\u03a9. Then, when the gyroscope returns to its initial local rest frame\none can evaluate the Thomas rotation angle from the knowledge of instantaneous precessions along the way. Note that this method is conceptually different\nfrom the special relativistic evaluation of the rotation angle from knowledge of\ninstantaneous Thomas precessions. For a clear distinction:\n\u2013 Thomas precession involves a gyroscope, an inertial frame, and the basepoint of the gyroscope is moving in the space of the inertial frame (and it makes\nsense only in special relativity).\n\u2013 The method suggested by [18] involves a gyroscope, a co-moving rotating\nframe such that the base-point of the gyroscope rests in a space point of the\nrotating frame (this can make sense in general relativity, too).\nWe recognize that the latter is analogous to the famous Foucault experiment:\nthe gyroscope is the pendulum (the base point of the gyroscope is the fixed point\nwhere the pendulum is hung, the three axes of the gyroscope are: vertical,\nhorizontal in the plane of swings and perpendicular to the plane of swings),\nthe rotating reference frame is the Earth; the pendulum keeps its direction (the\ndirection of its axes) and precesses with respect to the Earth. Therefore we find\nit convenient to introduce the terminology Foucault precession to describe this\nsituation.\nThomas rotation is a strictly relativistic phenomenon, while Foucault precession is a phenomenon which appears already in the non-relativistic setting. Under what circumstances can we use Foucault precession to evaluate the Thomas\nrotation angle? In [18] the authors restrict themselves to circular orbits in axially symmetric stationary spacetimes, and rotating frames with respect to which\nthe metric is also stationary. The authors of [5] do not take sufficient care in\nusing the concept of [18] and arrive at three different Thomas rotation angles\nusing three different rotating frames in special relativity (we will see later what\ngoes wrong there). Here we highlight the main points of the concept of [18]:\na; The world line r of the base-point of the gyroscope is given, and for\nsome proper time instant s there is a 'natural' isometric identification given\nbetween the tangent spaces at r(0) and r(s), such that under this identification\n\u1e59(s) = \u1e59(0),\nb; There is a reference frame U co-moving with the gyroscope, i.e. r is an\nintegral curve of U (a space-point in U-space),\nc; The Foucault-precession of the gyroscope in U-space makes sense (in\nsome well-defined mathematical sense),\nd; The Foucault-precession of the gyroscope is the negative of the angular\nvelocity of U,\ne; The correspondence of the tangent spaces at r(0) and r(s) established\nby the Lie transport corresponding to U is equal to the 'natural' identification\npreviously given.\nIn [18], in condition a the world line r is circular in an axially symmetric\nstationary spacetime (Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Kerr, G\u00f6del), and the 'natural' identification is given by the Lie transport corresponding to the 'natural'\n3\n\n\fcoordinatization of the spacetime model. In condition b the rotating frame is\nselected so that it also defines a stationary coordinatization, and c, d, e are then\n(heuristic) consequences of this choice.\nIn Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below we will give a mathematically rigorous definition of Foucault precession, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for c, d\nabove to hold.\nIn Section 4 we examine uniformly rotating reference frames in Schwarzschild\nand Minkowski spacetimes, and find that the Foucault precession makes sense\nfor the conventional frame (as in [18]), but not for the 'Trocheris-Takeno' and\n'modified Trocheris-Takeno' frames (as in [5]). In Section 5 we show by examples that condition e above is not an automatic consequence of conditions\na, b, c, d even in Minkowski space, and therefore it needs to be taken into account\nwhenever applying the method of [18].\n\n2\n\nNotions and notations\n\nWe shall use a coordinate free formulation of relativity (see e.g. [21]), applying\nthe following notions and notations: A reference frame U is a four-velocity field\nin spacetime M . The flow generated by U is denoted by R\u00d7M \u2192 M, (t, x) 7\u2192\nRt (x). For fixed t, DRt (x) is the derivative of x 7\u2192 Rt (x) at x. For fixed x,\nt 7\u2192 Rt (x) is a world line function describing a maximal integral curve of U.\nA maximal integral curve of U represents a 'reference particle'; the set of\nreference particles constitutes the physical space of the reference frame; so, a\nmaximal integral curve is considered to be a space point of U.\nLet the world line function r describe a U-space point, i.e. r(s) = Rs (x0 ) for\nsome world point x0 ; considering x0 as fixed, we shall omit it from the following\nnotations.

As described in the Introduction,\nThomas rotation at some proper time instant s is meaningful only if\n1) the tangent spaces at r(0) and r(s) are identified,\n2) \u1e59(0) = \u1e59(s) according to the identification in question.\nThen, taking a gyroscope, the linear map defined by zi (0) 7\u2192 zi (s) (i =\n1, 2, 3) is the Thomas rotation on the world line r between its proper time values\n0 and s.\nNote that condition 2) is important even in special relativity where condition\n1) is trivially satisfied.\nIn the cases examined by [18], condition 1) follows from the stationarity and\ncondition 2) follows from the axial symmetry.\n\n3.2\n\nFoucault precession\n\nLet U be a reference frame and z a gyroscopic vector along a world line function\nr which describes an integral curve of U, i.e. \u1e59(s) = U(r(s)). In other words,\nthe base point of the gyroscope rests in a space point of the reference frame.\nThe reference frame observes the gyroscopic vector as a time dependent\nvector h(s) in the U-space point in question; time, of course, means proper\ntime of r.\nRecall that U-space is endowed with a smooth structure ([9]), h(s) is a vector\nin the tangent space at the U-space point; according to the definition of that\nsmooth structure, the tangent space in question can be represented by the local\nrest frame at r(0), and then h(s) will be represented by h0 (s) := A(s)\u22121 z(s).\n\n5\n\n\fEr\nz1\nr1\n\n1\n\nEr\n\nz(s)\n\ns1\n\nr2\n\ns2\nz2 = z1\n\nEr = Er\n1\n\nlight cone\n\n2\n\npast\n\nr1=r2\n\n2\n\nz2\n\nfuture\n\nFigure 1: Thomas rotation in SR. At two different proper time values s1 and\ns2 the 4-velocities \u1e591 = \u1e59(s1 ) and \u1e592 = \u1e59(s2 ) are equal, so E\u1e591 = E\u1e592 , but the\ninitial and final gyroscopic vectors z1 = z(s1 ) \u2208 E\u1e591 and z2 = z(s2 ) \u2208 E\u1e592 are\ndifferent.\nThen we infer that\n\u1e230 = (A\u22121 )* z + A\u22121 \u017c = \u2212(A\u22121 \u0226)h0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, of course, the dot on the right hand side denotes \u2207\u1e59 ; the second term in\nthe middle expression is zero because \u017c is parallel to \u1e59.\nThe Foucault precession, i.e. the angular velocity of a gyroscope with respect\nto the reference frame, is meaningful if and only if \u03a90 (s) := \u2212A\u22121 (s)\u0226(s) is\nan antisymmetric map in E\u1e59(0) , equivalently, if and only if A(s) is an isometric\nmap from E\u1e59(0) to E\u1e59(s) for all s.

A reference frame U perceives a precession of a\ngyroscopic vector z whose base-point rests at the space point r of the reference\nframe.\nWe can now deduce from formulae (10) and (13) that the Foucault precession\nis meaningful at a space point of a reference frame U if and only if U is rigid\nat that space point, and then the angular velocity of the Foucault precession is\nthe negative of the angular velocity of the reference frame. Indeed, since the\nzero proper time point can be chosen arbitrarily, we have to show only that\n\u0226(0)A\u22121 (0) = P(0)L\u0307(0)P(0) which follows from (4), (5) and from the facts\nthat L(0) is the identity and P(0)\u1e56(0)P(0) = 0.\nSubsections 3.2 and 3.3 clarify the theoretical background of conditions c, d\nin the Introduction. The necessary and sufficient condition for c and d to hold is\nthat the reference frame co-moving with the gyroscope be rigid in the base-point\nof the gyroscope.\n\n4\n\nRotating reference frames\n\nIn this section we examine uniformly rotating reference frames in Minkowski\nand Schwarzschild spacetimes. An abstract definition is given in both cases,\nbut further calculations are only carried out in Minkowski spacetime to make\ncomparison with [5] possible.\nHere we use the notations of the special relativistic spacetime model expounded in [9], [10] (which is in accordance with [21]). Minkowski spacetime\nM is an affine space over the vector space M and the spacetime distances form\nan oriented one dimensional vector space I, so the metric tensor is of the form\nM \u00d7 M \u2192 I \u2297 I, (x, y) 7\u2192 x * y.\nThe Levi-Civita connection is the usual differentiation, denoted by the symbol D.\n7\n\n\fIn Minkowski spacetime, in this abstract formalism one can easily introduce\na general notion (a whole family) of uniformly rotating reference frames, and the\nusually considered rotating coordinate transformations appear as special cases\nof this general form (with appropriate synchronization).\nIt is remarkable that finding the 'canonical' coordinate system describing a\nrotating reference frame has been a minor but long-standing problem in special\nrelativity theory; that is why the 'Trocheris-Takeno' ([26], [23]) and the 'modified\nTrocheris-Takeno' transformations ([4]) were introduced, after theorists were not\nsatisfied with the conventional rotating coordinates.\nIn coordinate transformations, however, a reference frame and a synchronization are intermingled and this can lead to confusion: e.g. the Trocheris-Takeno\ntransformation and the modified Trocheris-Takeno transformation concern the\nsame reference frame with different synchronization.\nIt is also worth mentioning here that rotating reference frames seem to give\nrise to numerous misunderstandings and alleged paradoxes in special relativity\n(see e.g. the Ehrenfest paradox [2] with a number of refutations from different\npoints of view [19, 24, 7, 8], or Selleri's recent paradox [22] with refutations\nin [11], [20].) We feel that all these misunderstandings could be avoided if the\nstandard language of relativity (i.e. coordinate systems and coordinate transformations) were replaced by a systematic use the abstract notions of reference\nframes and synchronizations.\nHeuristically a (uniformly) rotating reference frame is characterized by the\nproperty that its space points are rotating around an inertial centre which is\nthe world line o + uI, described by a specific world point o, and a four-velocity\nu. The rotation around the centre, i.e. in the spacelike hyperplane Eu , is\ncharacterized by the angular velocity of the rotation, an antisymmetric linear\nmap 0 6= \u03a9 : Eu \u2192 EIu which is conveniently extended to the whole M in such\na way that \u03a9u = 0. Then at an arbitrary point x \u2208 M the velocity of the\nrotation relative to the centre is proportional to \u03a9(x \u2212 o), so U(x) is the linear\ncombination of u and \u03a9(x \u2212 o). Thus, we accept that given positive real valued\nsmooth functions a,b : R+ \u2192 R+ such that\na(x)2 \u2212 b(x)2 |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2 = 1,\n\n(14)\n\na corresponding rotating reference frame is defined as\nU(x) = a(x)u + b(x)\u03a9(x \u2212 o).\n\n(15)\n\nThe normalization condition (14) ensures that U does indeed map to the set of\nfour-velocities.\nNote the following special cases\n1\nwhich is the conventional rotating\n1. a(x) = b(x) = p\n1 \u2212 |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2\nreference frame ([15], [10]),\nsinh |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|\n(the Trocheris-Takeno\n2. a(x) = cosh |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|, b(x) =\n|\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|\nreference frame [26], [23]),\n8\n\n\fp\n2 , b = 1 ([10]),\n1 + |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|\u221a\na2 \u2212 1\n.\n4. a = const > 1, b(x) =\n|\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|\nIt is a simple fact that all the U-space points are circular world lines: the\none passing through the world point x is given by the function\n3. a(x) =\n\ns 7\u2192 o + sa(x)u + esb(x)\u03a9 (x \u2212 o).\n\n(16)\n\nNow let us consider Schwarzschild spacetime which can be given by the\nprevious objects in such a way that the spacetime metric is\ng(x) := 1 + h(x)u \u2297 u +\n\nh(x)\nn(x) \u2297 n(x)\n1 \u2212 h(x)\n\n(17)\n\n2m\n,\nr(x)\n\n(1 + u \u2297 u)(x \u2212 o)\n,\nr(x)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\nh(x) :=\n\nn(x) :=\n\nr(x) = |(1 + u \u2297 u)(x \u2212 o)|.\n\n(19)\n\nNow, if (1 + h(x))a(x)2 \u2212 b(x)2 |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2 = 1 then (15) defines a rotating\nreference frames for world points x satisfying r(x) > 2m. For further elaboration and an interesting application of this formalism and rotating observers in\nSchwarzschild spacetime see [14], where the time-rate between satellite clocks\nand Earth-based clocks is calculated.\n\n4.1\n\nFoucault precession in rotating reference frames\n\nNow we investigate whether Foucault precession in the space of the rotating\nreference frames defined above in Minkowski spacetime is meaningful. In view\nof Section 3 this is equivalent to the reference frames being rigid.\nWe restrict our attention to the case when the coefficients in the linear\ncombination depend only on |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2 (and not on x), i.e. there are positive\nreal valued smooth functions \u03b1, \u03b2 : R+ \u2192 R+ such that\na(x) = \u03b1(|\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2 ),\n\nb(x) = \u03b2(|\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2 ).\n\n(20)\n\nFor the sake of brevity, we introduce the notation\nk(x) := |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2\n\n(21)\n\nand we shall use the following formulae:\nd|\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2\ndk(x)\n=\n= \u22122\u03a92 (x \u2212 o),\ndx\ndx\nd\u03b1(k(x))\n= \u22122\u03b1\u2032 (k(x))\u03a92 (x \u2212 o),\ndx\nd\u03b2(k(x))\n= \u22122\u03b2 \u2032 (k(x))\u03a92 (x \u2212 o),\ndx\n9\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\n\fwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the real variable of the\nfunctions. Moreover, we infer from (14) that\n2\u03b1(k)\u03b1\u2032 (k) \u2212 2\u03b2(k)\u03b2 \u2032 (k)k = \u03b2 2 (k).\n\n(25)\n\nThen we find that\n\u0001\nDU(x) = \u22122 \u03b1\u2032 (k(x))u + \u03b2 \u2032 (k(x))\u03a9(x \u2212 o) \u2297 \u03a92 (x \u2212 o) + \u03b2(k(x))\u03a9,\n\n(26)\n\nA simple calculation shows that (1 + U(x) \u2297 U(x))DU(x)(1 + U(x) \u2297 U(x))\nis antisymmetric if and only if\n2\u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1\u03b2 2\n\n2\u03b2 \u2032 = \u03b2 3 .\n\n(27)\n\nWe can solve the second equation for \u03b2, and then taking into account (14),\nwe find that there is a positive constant a such that\n1\n\u03b1(k(x)) = p\n,\n2\n1 \u2212 a |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2\n\na\n\u03b2(k(x)) = p\n.\n2\n1 \u2212 a |\u03a9(x \u2212 o)|2\n\n(28)\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the Foucault precession is meaningful for the\nconventional rotating frame (a = 1), but it is not meaningful for the rotating\nreference frames 2, 3 and 4 listed in Section 4. Hence, the principle of [18] can\nbe applied to the conventional rotating frame (where condition e is also satisfied,\nas is easy to check), but not to the 'Trocheris-Takeno' or 'modified TrocherisTakeno' frames.\n\n5\n\nThomas rotation versus Foucault precession\n\nIn this section we show that the angular velocity of a single world line cannot\ncanonically be defined. This shows that the Foucault precession of a gyroscope\ndepends on the choice of the co-moving reference frame. Accordingly, the knowledge of instantaneous Foucault precessions can only be used to determine the\nThomas rotation angle if condition e of the Introduction is satisfied. We will\nshow by examples that this condition is not a consequence of a, b, c, d even in\nMinkowski space, and therefore it needs to be taken care of separately whenever\napplying the principle of [18].\n\n5.1\n\nA special family of reference frames\n\nLet r be an arbitrary smooth world line function in Minkowski spacetime. For x\nin a neighbourhood of the range of r, there is a unique proper time value s(x) of\nr such that x \u2212 r(s(x)) is orthogonal to \u1e59(s(x)); it is determined by the implicit\nrelation (x \u2212 r(s)) * \u1e59(s) = 0.\nThe function x 7\u2192 s(x) satisfies\nds(x)\n\u1e59(s(x))\n=\u2212\n,\ndx\n1 + (x \u2212 r(s(x))) * r\u0308(s(x))\n10\n\n(29)\n\n\fNote that\n\nds(x)\ndx\n\nx=r(s)\n\n= \u2212\u1e59(s).\n\n(30)\n\nLet s 7\u2192 H(s) be a smooth map such that H(s) : M \u2192 M is Lorentz\ntransformation for which H(s)\u1e59(0) = \u1e59(s) holds. (H(s) can be for example the\nLorentz boost from \u1e59(0) to \u1e59(s) or the Fermi-Walker transport along r from 0\nto s.) Given such a one-parameter family H(s), and any antisymmetric linear\ns\u0393\nmap \u0393 : M \u2192 M\nI for which \u0393 * \u1e59(0) = 0, the associated family H\u0393 (s) := H(s)e\nis another such family, so we have some freedom when choosing H(s).\nThen putting\n\u0001\n(31)\nV(x) := \u1e59(s(x)) + \u1e22(s(x))H(s(x))\u22121 x \u2212 r(s(x)) ,\nwe define the reference frame\nU(x) :=\n\nV(x)\n|V(x)|\n\n(32)\n\n\u221a\nwhere, of course, |V| = \u2212V * V. Evidently, \u1e59(s) = U(r(s)), so the world line\ndescribed by r is the space point of different reference frames given by different\nH-s.\nThen\nDV V \u2297 (DV)V\n.\n(33)\n+\nDU =\n|V|\n|V|3\nSince V(r(s)) = \u1e59(s), |V(r(s)| = 1, DV(r(s)) = \u2212r\u0308(s) \u2297 \u1e59(s) + \u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 (1 +\n\u1e59(s) \u2297 \u1e59(s)) and (DV(r(s))V(r(s) = r\u0308(s), we have that\nP(s)(DU)(r(s))P(s) = P(s)\u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 P(s).\n\n(34)\n\nSince \u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 is antisymmetric, the right hand side is antisymmetric as\nwell, thus the reference frame is rigid at r and its angular velocity (see (13)) at\nr(s) is\nP(s)\u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 P(s).\n(35)\nIf we take H\u0393 (s) := H(s)es\u0393 , then the angular velocity of the reference frame\nat r(s) is\nP(s)\u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 P(s) + H(s)\u0393H(s)\u22121 .\n(36)\nThus, according to our result in Subsection 3.3, for any choice of H(s), the\nFoucault precession in the space point, given by r, of the reference frame (32)\nis meaningful.\nWe call attention to the following fact. According to (36), the same world\nline can be a space point of different reference frames with different angular\nvelocities; the properties of a single world line are in no relation with the angular\nvelocity of a reference frame having the world line as a space point; the angular\nvelocity of a single world line cannot be defined.\nNote that, in particular,\n\n11\n\n\f\u2013 if H(s) is the Lorentz boost from \u1e59(0) to \u1e59(s), then \u1e22(s)H(s)\u22121 =\n(\u1e59(s) + \u1e59(0)) \u2227 r\u0308(s) and \u0001the angular velocity of the refrence frame at r(s) equals\n\u1e59(0) + \u1e59(s)(\u1e59(s) * \u1e59(0)) \u2227 r\u0308(s),\n\u2013 if H(s) is the Fermi-Walker transport along r from 0 to s, then H(s)\u22121 \u1e22(s)\n= \u1e59(s) \u2227 r\u0308(s) and the angular velocity of the reference frame at r(s) is zero.\nOne can be tempted to say that the circular world line (16) has angular\nvelocity \u03b2(x)\u03a9 but in view of the discussion above this is not right: the circular\nworld line can be the space point of several reference frame having different\nangular velocities.\n\n5.2\n\nThomas rotation versus Foucault precession\n\nIf the Foucault precession of a gyroscope with respect to a co-moving reference\nframe is meaningful, then the time-integral of the Foucault precession results in\na finite angle. This angle can then be compared to the Thomas rotation angle.\nWe have seen in the Introduction that in Special Relativity the instantaneous\nThomas precession depends on the inertial frame who observes the gyroscope,\nbut its time integral always gives the Thomas rotation angle when the gyroscope\nreturns to its initial local rest frame. One might be tempted to think that the\nsituation is similar with Foucault precession: although it depends on the choice\nof the co-moving frame, the calculated rotation angle should always give the\nThomas rotation. However, this is not true in such generality and some care\nmust be taken here.\nIn fact, after an arbitrary time period s, the Foucault precession results\n\u22121\n(0)*h0 (s)\nz(s)\nin an angle whose cosine is h0|h(0)|\n= z(0)*A(s)\n, h0 being the solution\n2\n|z(0)|2\nof the differential equation (9). Thomas rotation, on the other hand, is only\ndefined at such an sT for which some previously given 'natural' identification N\nis given between the tangent spaces at r(0) and r(sT ). In that case, the cosine\n\u22121\nz(sT )\nof Thomas rotation is given by z(0)*N\n. Therefore, the necessary and\n|z(0)|2\nsufficient condition for the two angles to be the same is that A(sT )\u22121 z = N\u22121 z\nfor all space-like vectors z, i.e. A(sT ) = NP(0). This is what we called condition\ne in the Introduction. We now show by an easy example that this condition is\nnot a direct consequence of the other conditions a, b, c, d, even in Minkowski\nspacetime where the identification N is taken to be the identity.\nIndeed, let us consider the reference frame (32). It is easy to see that the\nfunction s 7\u2192 \u03c1q (s) := r(s) + H(s)q for q \u2208 E\u1e59(0) satisfies \u03c1\u0307q (s) = V(\u03c1q (s)).\nThus, though \u03c1q is not a world line function, its range is a world line, a space\npoint of U. The proper time value t corresponding to the world line described\nby \u03c1q defines a proper time value s(t, q) of r via the differential equation ds\ndt =\n1\n.\n|\u1e59(s)+\u1e22(s)q|\nAs a consequence, we have for the flow generated by U:\nRt (r(0) + q) = r(s(t, q)) + H(s(t, q)q\n\n(q \u2208 E\u1e59(0) ).\n\n(37)\n\nFor getting A(s) (see (1) and (4)), we have to differentiate the flow in the\n12\n\n\fplane r(0) + E\u1e59(0) , i.e. to differentiate the above expression with respect to q\nand then to put q = 0. As a result we get\nA(s) = H(s)P(0) = P(s)H(s)P(0) = P(s)H(s).\n\n(38)\n\nSimilarly, we have A\u0393 (s) = H(s)es\u0393 P(0) for the reference frame constructed\nby H\u0393 (s) := H(s)es\u0393 . Clearly, A\u0393 (s) depends on the choice of \u0393 and need not\nequal the identity operator. Therefore, condition e is not a consequence of\na, b, c, d.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe conclude that the principle of [18] to calculate the Thomas rotation angle\nof a gyroscopic vector is applicable whenever conditions a, b, c, d, e are satisfied.\nConditions c and d are equivalent to the fact that the co-moving reference frame\nis rigid at the base point of the gyroscope, while condition e has to be checked\nseparately. All conditions are satisfied in the cases considered in [18] due to\nthe symmetries of the spacetime models, the circularity of the world line, and\nthe choice of the co-moving rotating frame. In [5] the 'Trocheris-Takeno' and\nthe 'modified Trocheris-Takeno' frames fail to be rigid, and hence lead to an\nincorrect Thomas rotation angle. It is also clear from our discussion that the\nmethod of [18] is, in principle, not restricted to stationary spacetimes or reference\nframes corresponding to Killing vector fields. For instance, the Thomas rotation\nof a gyroscope moving along an elliptic world line in Schwarzschild spacetime\ncould also be calculated if a rigid co-moving frame with property e is given\n(which, however, does not seem easy to define).\n\nReferences\n[1] Costella J.P., McKellar B.H.J., Rawlinson A.A., Stephenson G.J.
