No doubts can be raised on the validity of this theory.\nNevertheless, even at one century since its birth, many problems related to the interpretation of this theory persist, in particular concerning the concept of measurement in Quantum\nMechanics and the related problem of the transition from a microscopic probabilistic world\nto a macroscopic deterministic world perfectly described by classical mechanics. The disappearence of superposition effects for macroscopic bodies is known as \"decoherence\". Besides\nthe huge theoretical interest for understanding this phenomenon, a clear comprehension of\ndecoherence is also mandatory for constructing quantum computers and thus it is of primary\nrelevance in studies concerning quantum information.\nMany different models have been proposed for describing decoherence [1], but none of\nthem has reached a general acceptance.\nHowever, it is now emerging the possibility of realising experiments concerning the transition region between quantum and classical mechanics. This is obtained studying mesoscopic\nstates [2,3], i.e. systems composed by a number of particles for which one expects an intermediate behaviour between quantum and classical mechanics.\nIn particular a huge interest is devoted to the generation of linear superpositions of\n\"macroscopically\" distinguishable states, dubbed \" Schr\u00f6dinger cats\", which would permit\na direct study of decoherence. Many different schemes have been proposed for realising\nsuperpositions of many photons states using optical amplifiers [4] or cavities [5]. However,\nthe practical realisation of these schemes is very difficult due to the necessity of creating\na state with an average number of photons sufficiently high to be considered a mesoscopic\nsystem without that it decoheres too rapidly for being detected. Furthermore one has to find\na smart scheme for detecting the superposition. Up to now only the beautiful experiment\nof Brune et al. [3] has succeeded in obtaining a superposition state involving an atom and\n\n2\n\n\ffew photons in a cavity.\nIt remains therefore a large interest in proposing and studying new configurations for\nrealising Schr\u00f6dinger cats.\nIn a recent paper [6] we have proposed a scheme addressed to the creation of a superposition of two coherent states using a Kerr cell.\nIn this letter we would like to investigate in details the real possibility of creating and\nrecognising such a state.\nThe idea is to use the set-up of fig.1, where a \"signal\" photon enters the PolarisingBeam-Splitter I (PBS I) from port 1. Let us suppose that this photon is in a superposition\nof vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarisation, which will take different paths, for example\nlet us assume the vertical one will follow path 2 and the horizontal path 3.\nFurthermore, a probe laser crosses the Kerr cell on the arm 3 acquiring a phase or not\naccording if the photon crosses or not the cell.\nThus the entangled state:\n|\u03a8i =\n\n|Hi|\u03bd \u2032i + |V i|\u03bdi\n\u221a\n2\n\n(1)\n\nis generated, where the coherent state |\u03bd \u2032 i differs in phase from |\u03bdi.\nThe two signal photon paths are then recombined on a second beam splitter (BSII) and\na polarisation measurement (P1) is performed on this photon on the base at 45o respect to\nthe horizontal-vertical base. This is the conditional measurement producing the Schr\u00f6dinger\ncat: if the signal photon is found to have a 45o polarisation, the coherent state is projected\ninto the superposition\n|\u03c8+ i =\n\n|\u03bd \u2032 i + |\u03bdi\n\u221a\n2\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fon the other hand if the orthogonal polarisation is detected, the projection will be in\n|\u03c8\u2212 i =\n\n|\u03bd \u2032 i \u2212 |\u03bdi\n\u221a\n2\n\n(3)\n\nA superposition of two \"many photons\" states is thus obtained.\nThe one photon signal state can be easily produced, for example, using parametric down\nconversion (PDC) in a non-linear crystal. In this case the second photon of the downconverted pair can be used as trigger. Furthermore, if the same pulsed laser is used both\nfor pumping the crystal and for the Kerr effect, one can easily obtain a good timing for the\ncrossing of the Kerr cell for the signal photon and the coherent state.\nIncidentally, the use as input of a photon from PDC in a Kerr cell allows also the creation\nof a three photons GHZ entangled state [9], which is one of the three elements necessary for\nrealising an optical quantum computer [10], together with single qubit operations, which are\neasily implemented, and teleportation. For what concerns this last , a description of a scheme\nperforming this operation using a Kerr cell appears in Ref. [11]. Using the same polarisation\ndependence of the Kerr interaction of Ref. [11], where there is no effect except when both\nthe photons interacting in the Kerr cell have vertical polarization (|V i|V i \u2192 |V i|V iei\u03c6 ), a\nGHZ state can be generated by the interaction of an entangled pair of photons with a third\none. Let us assume, for example, of having generated, by PDC, an entangled state of the\nform [13]:\n|\u03a6+ i =\n\n|Hi|Hi + |V i|V i\n\u221a\n2\n\n(4)\n\nA simple algebraic calculation shows that the interaction in the Kerr medium of the second\nphoton of the pair with a third photon polarised at 45o (denoted by |45i, whilst its orthogonal\nstate will be |135i), is, for a phase shift \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, the GHZ state:\n|\u03a8GHZ i =\n\n|Hi|Hi|45i + |V i|V i|135i\n\u221a\n.\n2\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fAnalogous results are easily derived for the other three Bell states.\nRecently a GHZ state of three photons has been generated experimentally [12]. However,\nalbeit very interesting for testing local realism, this scheme is not well suited for quantum\ncomputation, because of low efficiency. Our scheme could thus represent an alternative for\ngenerating GHZ states, which offers an interesting opportunity for applications to quantum\ncomputation.\nThe interest for these schemes derives by the fact that, although admittedly very difficult, the Quantum Non Demolition (QND) [14] detection of a single photon is at present\npossible [8,7]. QND measurements of welcher Weg (which path) have already been achieved\nusing 100 meter long optical fibers (see Imoto et al. and Levenson et al. [15]). Of course,\nthe implementation of the present schemes using such devices would be, even though not\nimpossible in theory, almost impossible in practice. The recent discovery of new materials\nwith very high Kerr coupling, could however allow an easier and more realistic implementation of this experiment. Two candidates as Kerr cell with ultra-high susceptibility to be\nused for this scheme are the Quantum Coherent Atomic Systems (QCAS) [17,8] and the\nBose-Einstein condensate of ultracold (at nanoKelvin temperatures) atomic gas [18]. These\nare recent great technical improvements which could permit the realisation of small Kerr\ncells, capable of large phase shift, even with a low-intensity probe. In fact, both exhibit\nextremely high Kerr couplings compared to more traditional materials. In particular, the\nQCAS is rather a simple system to be realised (for a review see [19]) and thus represents an\nideal candidate to this role. Incidentally, one can notice that Kerr coupling can be further\nenhanced by enclosing the medium in a cavity [20].\nA main advantage of the present configuration respect to the Schr\u00f6dinger cat generation\nusing cavities is given by the fact that the coherent states superposition travels in air between\nthe Kerr cell and the detection apparatus. Decoherence appears when at least one photon is\nlost permitting the identification of the phase of the state. In cavities this is related to the\n\n5\n\n\fdamping factor of the cavity itself and decoherence becomes rather rapid when the number\nof photons is increased (being proportional to the average photon number). In the case\nunder investigation the losses in air are rather small and could permit a much longer time\nbefore decoherence takes over.\nIn order to identify the macroscopic superposition we suggest to perform a homodyne\nmeasurement of the laser beam after the Kerr cell. Then the Wigner function can be\nreconstructed with tomographic techniques [21,22], the identification of a negative region\nof the Wigner function allows the identification of the cat (for a comprehensive study of\nquantum tomography see [23]).\nMore in details, one measures the probability distribution p(x, \u03c6) for the field quadrature\nx = 1/2(ae\u2212i\u03c6 + a\u2020 ei\u03c6 ) at various phases \u03c6, then, using the Radon transform, the Wigner\nfunction is reconstructed. Experimentally, one obtains a table of p(x, \u03c6) in terms of x and\n\u03c6. In order not to have troubles with delicate cancellations of different elements in the\nsummations, it is convenient to fit the x dependence at different \u03c6 and then use this fit in\nintegrals.\nIn the following we will study the real possibility of reconstructing the Wigner function\nand observing a negative region, when experimental errors are kept into account. For this\npurpose, we will use the reconstruction technique described in [22], appropriately deteriorating the calculated distribution p(x, \u03c6) in order to simulate experimental errors. In practice,\nwe introduce a random error, simulating the experimental error on each fit of p(x, \u03c6) at fixed\n\u03c6 for each Montecarlo run.\nWe will consider different superpositions systematically in order to give a panorama of\nthe different situations.\nProbably, a good compromise between having a sufficiently high number of photons and\nkeeping at the same time a sufficiently small decoherence time could be realised with a co-\n\n6\n\n\fherent state with an average number of photons about 5-10. This represents a \"mesoscopic\"\nsystem where intermediate properties between \"classical\" and quantum systems can be expected. Furthermore, one can hope to be able to study decoherence at work for such kind\nof systems.\nLet us consider of having realised a superposition\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03a8cat i = | 5ei\u03b8 i + | 5e\u2212i\u03b8 i\n\n(6)\n\nWe begin with the case \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. The Wigner function W [Re(\u03b1), Im(\u03b1)] (plotted in\nfig.2) has an absolute minimum for W [0.3346, 0] = \u22123.16. A tomographic reconstruction\nbased on ten phase points for p(x, \u03c6) (this function is shown for the sake of exemplification\nin fig.3) is sufficient for reproducing this value with an uncertainty less than 3%. We have\nthen considered the situation where the distribution p(x, \u03c6) is deteriorated simulating an\nexperimental error around \u00b125%, the result of an average on ten points calculated by a\nMontecarlo simulation is W [0.3346, 0] = \u22123.08 \u00b1 0.29: then even with such large errors bars\nwe are able to reconstruct the minimum negative value with only a 10% uncertainty. For\nthe sake of completeness, we have also repeated the evaluation with a simulated error of\n50 %, the result is W [0.3346, 0] = \u22122.84 \u00b1 0.84. Even in this case the negative part of the\nWigner function would be recognisable (with a 30 % relative error).\nThen we have investigated the case \u03b8 = 63o . The Wigner function W [Re(\u03b1), Im(\u03b1)]\n(plotted in fig.4) has an absolute minimum for W [0.8954, 0] = \u22123.916. Also in this case a\ntomographic reconstruction based on ten phase points for p(x, \u03c6) is sufficient for reproducing\nthis value with an uncertainty less than 3%, albeit a larger calculation time is needed. Again,\nwe have considered the situation where the distribution p(x, \u03c6) is deteriorated simulating\nan experimental error around \u00b125%, the result of the Montecarlo simulation (averaging\n10 points) is W [0.8954, 0] = \u22123.83 \u00b1 0.48: we are thus able to reconstruct the minimum\nnegative value with only a 12.5% uncertainty. For the sake of completeness, we have also\n7\n\n\finvestigated the tomographic reconstruction of the local minimum W [0.157, 0] = \u22120.890.\nAn average of ten Montecarlo simulated points gives W [0.157, 0] = \u22120.910 \u00b1 0.193, with a\nrelative error of 21.3%.\nWhen the relative phase between the two coherent states is further reduced the tomographic reconstruction of the Wigner function requires a very large calculation time; however,\nup to a phase difference of 0.1 radiants the negative region of the Wigner function can still\nbe identified (e.g. for \u03b8 = 0.2 radiants the minimum is W [2.687, 0] = \u22120.679).\nFinally, we have also investigated the case where the average number of photons is 10: a\npart the need of a longer calculation time, the same situation as the previous case is found.\nIn summary, the results of our numerical simulation show that the tomographic reconstruction of the Wigner function is such that even with 25%, or larger, errors on the\nhomodyne reconstruction of p(x, \u03c6) the cat can be easily identified. We think thus that this\ntechnique can be an interesting tool for recognising an optical Schr\u00f6dinger cat realised as\nsuperposition of two coherent state with different phase.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that an optical Schr\u00f6dinger cat (superposition of two\ncoherent states) can be generated using a Mach-Zender interferometer crossed by a one\nphoton state, where on one of the paths of the interferometer a Kerr cell is inserted. A laser\ncrosses the cell as well and the coherent states superposition is generated by a conditional\nmeasurement on the one photon state. The produced state is robust against decoherence.\nWe have also discussed the experimental possibility of recognising the cat, once it has\nbeen created, using a tomographic technique for reconstructing its Wigner function. Our\nnumerical simulations show that this reconstruction is such that the cat can be recognised\neven if rather large experimental errors affect the homodyne detection.\nAltogether, our results show that the proposed scheme for generating and detecting an\noptical superposition of macroscopic states can be efficient, also thanks to the appearance\n8\n\n\fof new materials with very high Kerr couplings, as Bose condensate. We think that this\nscheme deserves attention for an experimental realisation of it.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge support of ASI under contract LONO 500172, of MURST\nvia special programs \"giovani ricercatori\" Dip.
