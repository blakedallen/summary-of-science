Since a quantum phase\ntransition1,2 is necessarily accompanied by a diverging\ncorrelation length as well as a diverging relaxation time,\nthe dynamics of the system cannot be adiabatic for the\nentire period of the evolution however slow the variation in the parameter may be. (The relaxation time of\na quantum system is given by the inverse of the energy\ngap which goes to zero at the quantum critical point).\nAssuming that the system was initially prepared in its\nground state, the non-adiabaticity near a quantum critical point prevents the system from following its instantaneous ground state resulting in the production of defects\nin the final state.\nThe Kibble-Zurek (KZ) argument3 asserts that the\nnon-adiabatic effect becomes prominent only close to the\ncritical point when the rate of change of the Hamiltonian\nis of the order of the relaxation time of the underlying\nquantum system. When a parameter of the quantum\nHamiltonian is varied as t/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the characteristic time scale of the quenching, the above argument\npredicts a density of of defects in the final state that\nscales as 1/\u03c4 d\u03bd/(z\u03bd+1) in the limit of \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Here \u03bd\nand z denote the correlation length and dynamical exponents, respectively, characterizing the associated quantum phase transition of the d-dimensional quantum system. The KZ prediction has been verified for various\nexactly solvable spin models when quenched across a\ncritical4,5 or a multicritical6 point at a uniform linear\nrate. The above studies have been generalized to explore\nthe defect production in a non-linear quench across a\nquantum critical point where a parameter in the Hamiltonian is varied as |t/\u03c4 |\u03b1 with \u03b1 > 07 . Recent experimental studies on the dynamics of quantum systems8 , espe-\n\ncially quantum magnets9 , ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices10 and spin-one Bose-Einstein condensates11 ,\nhave paved the way for a plethora of related theoretical\nstudies4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15,16,17 .\n\nAnother interesting scenario emerges when a lowdimensional quantum system is quenched through a gapless phase or an extended quantum critical region18,19,20 .\nIt has been established that when a d-dimensional system\nis quenched along a (d \u2212 m)-dimensional critical surface,\nthe scaling of the defect density with \u03c4 is modified to a\ngeneralized KZ form given by 1/\u03c4 m\u03bd/(z\u03bd+1)19 .\n\nIn the present work, we explore the dynamics of a\none-dimensional anisotropic XY spin-1/2 chain in the\npresence of a transverse field which alternates between\nh + \u03b4 and h \u2212 \u03b4 from site to site. We employ a new\nquenching scheme in which the parameter determining\nthe anisotropy of interaction is quenched as t/\u03c4 , keeping\nthe strength of interaction fixed, in such a way that the\nsystem is driven along a gapless line on a critical surface\nin the parameter space. We show that the density of defect scales as 1/\u03c4 1/3 , a result that cannot be explained\nby the previous studies on the quenching through a gapless phase. We also propose a general scaling relation for\nsuch a quenching dynamics along a gapless line.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Our model, the\nquenching scheme and the results obtained for the generation of defects are presented in Sec. II. At the end of\nthat section, we propose a general scaling relation for the\ndefect density when a system is quenched along a gapless\nline. We end with some concluding remarks in Sec.

The spin chain undergoes a quantum phase transition\nwith \u03bd = 2 and z = 1 when these points are approached along\nthe dashed line. On the other hand, the dotted line shows the\ndirection of the quenching of the transverse field.

In\nthis model, there exists an Ising transition line at h = \u00b1J\nfrom the ferromagnetically ordered phase to a quantum\nparamagnetic phase. On the other hand, the vanishing of\nthe gap at \u03b3 = 0 signifies another quantum phase transition belonging to a different universality class between\ntwo ferromagnetically ordered phases.\nIt can be established using a numerical diagonalization\nof the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation involving the\nreduced Hamiltonian matrix that when the transverse\nfield h or the alternating term \u03b4 is quenched as t/\u03c4 from\n\u2212\u221e to \u221e, so that the system crosses the quantum critical\nlines as shown in Fig. 1, the density of defects n in the\nfinal state satisfies the Kibble-Zurek prediction22 . Our\ninterest however lies in the generation of defects when\nthe system is quenched along a gapless line. To achieve\nsuch a quenching, we vary the anisotropy parameter \u03b3\nlinearly as \u03b3 = t/\u03c4 from \u2212\u221e to \u221e, keeping h, \u03b4 and J\nfixed in such a way that the system always lies on the\nphase boundary h2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 . In the limit t \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\n\u03b3 is large and negative and hence in the ground state,\ny\nx\nthe expectation value h\u03c3jx \u03c3j+1\n\u2212 \u03c3jy \u03c3j+1\ni = \u22121. On the\nother hand, for an adiabatic evolution during the entire\nperiod of dynamics, this expectation value should be +1\nin the final state. One can choose different critical lines\nfor \u03b3-quenching by choosing different values of h and \u03b4\non the critical surface.\nThe eigenvalue \u039b\u2212\nk given by Eq. (4) can be written as\np\np\n\u03b4 2 + J 2 cos2 k)2 + 2h \u03b4 2 + J 2 cos2 k\nq\n+ \u03b3 2 sin2 k \u2212 2 h2 \u03b4 2 + h2 J 2 cos2 k + \u03b4 2 \u03b3 2 sin2 k]1/2 .\n\n\u039b\u2212\nk = [(h \u2212\n\n(6)\n\nOn the gapless line h2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 , the dispersion of the\nlow-energy excitations at k \u2192 0 can be approximated as\n\u039b\u2212\nk\n\n=\n\ns\n\n\u03b3 2J 2 k2\nJ 4 k4\n.\n+ 2\n2\n2\n4(\u03b4 + J ) \u03b4 + J 2\n\n(7)\n\nA close inspection of the above excitation spectrum\nsuggests that when \u03b3 is quenched along the gapless line,\nEq. (7) can be mapped to the spectrum of a 2\u00d72 LandauZener (LZ) Hamiltonian26,27 with two linearly approaching time-dependent levels. To show this explicitly, we\nnote that in the limit of very slow quenching, \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e,\ndefects are produced by sets of modes between which the\nenergy gap is very small. For the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3),\nthis occurs in the region of k = 0 if we take h2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 .\nLet us first set \u03b3 = 0 and k = 0. We then see that there\nare two modes, called |Ii and |IIi, whose energies are\nzero; the other two modes have energies which are both\nfar from zero and far from each other, and can therefore\nbe ignored in a slow quenching calculation. The zero\n\nenergy modes are given by\n\uf8eb\n1\n|Ii = p\n2\n\u03b4 + (h + J)2\n\n1\n|IIi = p\n2\n\u03b4 + (h + J)2\n\n\u03b4\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ed 0\nh+J\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ec \u03b4\n\uf8ed h+J\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\n(8)\n\nWe now deviate slightly from k = 0, still keeping \u03b3 = 0\nin Eq. (3). Doing degenerate perturbation theory to first\norder in Jk 2 , we find that the modes |Ii and |IIi remain\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian, but their energies are now\ngiven by\nE\u00b1 = \u00b1\n\nJ 2 k2\n\u221a\n,\n2 \u03b42 + J 2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we have used the relation h2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 . Finally,\nwe introduce the terms involving \u03b3 in Eq. (3). To first\norder in \u03b3, we find that the Hamiltonian in the basis of\n|Ii and |IIi is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 2\n1\nJ k /2 \u2212i\u03b3Jk\n.\n(10)\nhk = \u221a\ni\u03b3Jk \u2212J 2 k 2 /2\n\u03b42 + J 2\nIf we now perform a unitary transformation and vary \u03b3\nin time, we see that the Hamiltonian is of the LZ form,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b3\u0303(t)k J \u03032 k 2 /2\n,\n(11)\nhk =\nJ \u03032 k 2 /2 \u2212\u03b3\u0303(t)k\nwhere \u03b3\u0303 \u221a\nand J \u0303 are renormalized\u221aparameters given by\n\u03b3\u0303 = \u03b3J/ \u03b4 2 + J 2 and J \u03032 = J 2 / \u03b4 2 + J 2 . The diagonal terms in Eq. (11) describe two time-dependent levels\napproaching each other linearly in time (since \u03b3 = t/\u03c4 ),\nwhile the minimum gap is given by the off-diagonal term\nJ \u03032 k 2 /2. The probability of excitations pk from the\nground state to the excited state for the k-th mode is\ngiven by the Landau-Zener transition formula26,27\npk = exp [\u2212\n\n2\u03c0 J \u03034 k 4\n\n\u03c0J 3 k 3 \u03c4\n\u221a\n].\n]\n=\nexp\n[\u2212\n4 \u03b42 + J 2\n8k d\u03b3\u0303(t)\ndt\n\n(12)\n\nNote that for large \u03c4 , pk is dominated by values of k close\nto 0. The density of excitations n in the final state and\nin the large \u03c4 limit is obtained by integrating over all\nmodes in Eq. (12),\nZ \u03c0/2\n2\n1\n(13)\nn =\ndk pk \u223c 1/3 .\n\u03c0 0\n\u03c4\nThe numerical integration of Eq. (13) for \u03b4 = J = 1 is\nshown in Fig. 2 (a); although we have used the expression\ngiven in Eq. (12) for all values of k, the dominant contribution to n comes from the region near k = 0 where (12)\ncan be trusted. This shows that when quenched along a\ngapless line, the density of defects in the final state \u221a\nexhibits a slower decay with \u03c4 as compared to the 1/ \u03c4\n\n\f4\n\u22120.1\n\nfollowed by a Fourier transformation, we find an excitation spectrum of the form\n\n\u03b4 = 1 J=1\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u039b\u00b1\nk = [h + \u03b4 + (J + \u03b3s ) cos k + \u03b3 sin k\nq\n\u2212 2 (h2 + \u03b3s2 cos2 k)(\u03b4 2 + J 2 cos2 k) + \u03b4 2 \u03b3 2 sin2 k]1/2 ,\n\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.5\n\u22120.6\n\n(14)\n\nlog n\n\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.9\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03b4 = 0 J=1\n\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.9\n\u22121\n\u22121.1\n\u22121.2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nlog\u03c4\nFIG. 2: Fig. 2 (a) shows the variation of defect density n\nwith \u03c4 for \u03b4 = J = 1 obtained by numerically integrating Eq.\n(13), using pk given in Eq. (12). Fig. 2 (b) shows n obtained\nby direct numerical integration of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\nwith \u03b4 = 0. In both figures, the fitted data shows a slope of\n\u22121/3 confirming the n \u223c 1/\u03c4 1/3 behavior.\n\nwhich is observed in the case when the gapless line is\ncrossed by varying h22 . Our study also reveals that although the spectrum of this system involves four levels,\nthe quenching dynamics along the gapless line is essentially a two-level problem which can be studied using an\neffective Landau-Zener theory with parameters renormalized by \u03b4.\nThe case \u03b4 = 0 corresponds to quenching the system\nalong the Ising critical line of the transverse XY model,\nand one obtains an identical scaling of the defect density.\nFig. 2 (b) shows the 1/3 power-law obtained by numerically solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the anisotropic\ntransverse XY model when the anisotropy parameter \u03b3\nis quenched along the gapless line h = \u2212J = 1. (The\nHamiltonian in Eq. (3) has a 2 \u00d7 2 block diagonal form\nif \u03b4 = 0). One can also propose an alternative quenching\nscheme where the strength J is quenched from \u2212\u221e to\n\u221e, keeping h, \u03b4 and \u03b3 constant with \u03b4 2 = h2 + \u03b3 2 . The\nduality relation discussed above leads to the conclusion\nthat this quenching scheme is equivalent to the previous\none with \u03b3 = t/\u03c4 , and it yields a similar 1/\u03c4 1/3 behavior.\nThe XY chain with an alternating transverse field can\nbe further generalized by incorporating additional alternations in the strength or in the anisotropy of the interaction with the period of alternation being two. We denote\nthe alternation in the strength and the anisotropy by Js\nand \u03b3s , respectively, and for simplicity choose Js = 0.\nUsing a similar Jordan-Wigner transformation (Eq. (2))\n\nwhere the eigenvalue \u039b\u2212\nk has to be analyzed to explore\nthe quenching dynamics. Eq. (14) shows that the role\nof the alternation \u03b3s is to renormalize the strength J;\nconsequently, the phase boundary separating the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase gets shifted to\nh2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 \u2212 \u03b3s2 , with arbitrary \u03b3, at which the gapless\nexcitations occur at k = 0. Quenching \u03b3 as t/\u03c4 along\nthe new phase boundary h2 = \u03b4 2 + J 2 \u2212 \u03b3s2 with fixed\nvalues of J, h and \u03b3s , once again takes the system along\na gapless line on a critical surface.\nThe dynamics can be reduced to a two-level problem as\nbefore, and the low-energy excitations above the gapless\nline are given by\ns\n\n\u039b\u2212\nk =\n\n\u03b3 2 J 2 k2\n(J 2 \u2212 \u03b3s2 )2 k 4\n.\n+\n4(\u03b4 2 + J 2 )\n\u03b42 + J 2\n\n(15)\n\nThe defect density n in the final state decreases with \u03c4 as\n1/\u03c4 1/3 as can be derived from the Landau-Zener formula\nin an identical fashion. Similarly, one may set \u03b3s = 0\nand Js 6= 0 and consider an equivalent quenching scheme\nresulting in an identical scaling of the defect density.\nThe behavior of the defect density when quenched\nalong a gapless line suggests the following general scaling\nrelation of the defect density for a d-dimensional quantum system. Let the excitations on the gapless quantum\ncritical line be of the form \u03c9~k \u223c \u03b1|~k|z , where z is the dynamical exponent and the parameter \u03b1 = t/\u03c4 is quenched\nfrom \u2212\u221e to \u221e. Using a perturbative method involving\nthe Fermi Golden rule along with the fact that the system is initially prepared in the ground state, the defect\ndensity can be approximated as18\nn \u2243\n\nZ\n\ndd k\n|\n(2\u03c0)d\n\n\u221e\n\nR\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202\nd\u03b1 h~k| |0i ei\u03c4 \u03b4\u03c9~k (\u03b1 )d\u03b1 |2 .

Defining a new variable \u03be = \u03b1k z\u2212a ,\nwe obtain the scaling behavior of the defect density as\nn \u223c 1/\u03c4 d/(2a\u2212z) .\n\n(17)\n\nThe case d = 1, a = 2 and z = 1 has been discussed\nin the present work. Note that the correlation length\nexponent \u03bd does not appear in the expression in Eq. (17)\nbecause our quench dynamics always keeps the system on\na critical line.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the defect density produced in the final state when a generalized spin-1/2 XY\nchain with an alternating transverse field as well as an alternating nearest-neighbor interaction is quenched along\nthe Ising critical line by varying the anisotropy parameter\n\u03b3. We show that the non-adiabatic transition probability and hence the defect density can be estimated using\nan equivalent Landau-Zener problem in which the parameters are renormalized by the alternating parameters\n\u03b4 and \u03b3s (or Js ). We find that the defect density decays with the characteristic time scale of quenching given\nby 1/\u03c4 1/3 . The defect scaling exponent obtained here\ndoes not fit the KZ scaling 1/\u03c4 d\u03bd/(z\u03bd+1) .
