Introduction\nIn the early 1970's it was recognized that acoustic waves in the\nradiation dominated matter prior to the epoch of recombination of hydrogen in the Universe resulted in the characteristic\npattern of maxima and minima in the post-recombination matter power spectrum (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1970; Peebles & Yu\n1970; Doroshkevich et al. 1978). These acoustic peaks depend\non the size of the sound horizon and on the relative phases of\nthe perturbations containing different masses at the moment of\nrecombination. In the currently most favourable cosmological\nmodels with a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) component dominating signifiantly over the baryonic part, the acoustic features in\nthe matter power spectrum are strongly damped, reaching only\n\u223c 5% level for the \"concordance\" model (Bahcall et al. 1999;\nSpergel et al. 2003). For early description of the acoustic oscillations in the context of the CDM models see Blumenthal et al.\n(1988). For a given set of parameters of the Universe (\u03a9b h2 ,\n\u03a9m h2 ) the position of the maxima and minima are fully determined (e.g. Eisenstein & Hu 1998). Acoustic oscillations also\nleave their imprint on the angular perturbations of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB). MAXIMA-1, 1 Boomerang, 2\n\nWMAP, 3 VSA, 4 CBI, 5 and many other CMB experiments\ndetected the first acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum\nwith a high confidence level (Hanany et al. 2000; Netterfield\net al. 2002; Bennett et al. 2003; Grainge et al. 2003; Pearson\net al. 2003). These observations gave very important information about the key parameters of the Universe using the angular\nscale of acoustic features as rulers and taking into account the\nratio of amplitudes of the different peaks.\nThe existence of acoustic rulers in the Universe is of enormous importance since they permit us to measure the behavior\nof the Hubble parameter with redshift and also allow us to establish the distance-redshift relation. This is especially important now when the discovery of dark energy (DE) is introducing\nmore questions than the answers it provides. Different areas of\nobservational cosmology (SNe Ia e.g. SCP ,6 high-z SN search;\n7\nlarge scale structure surveys e.g. SDSS, 8 2dF 9 ; CMB experiments) provide evidence that the expansion of our Universe\nhas been proceeding in an accelerated fashion since z \u223c 0.75\n(Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Spergel et al. 2003).\nCurrently there is no physical understanding or even a reliable\nmodel for the DE.

H\u00fctsi: Clustering of SZ clusters\n\nture of DE will be the measurement of its equation of state\nparameter, w = P/\u03c1, and its possible evolution with time w(z).\nWhen we are equipped with a good standard ruler and are able\nto measure its angular behavior with redshift, we can obtain\nvery valuable information about w(z). With the CMB data we\ncan determine an angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface with high precision. By combining this information\nwith the measurement of acoustic peaks in the distribution of\nbaryons at lower redshifts 0 < z < 1 \u2212 2, we will have unique\ninformation about the effective w and may even be able to determine w(z) (Eisenstein & Hu 1998; Blake & Glazebrook 2003;\nHu & Haiman 2003; Linder 2003; Seo & Eisenstein 2003).\nIt was obvious since the first publications that acoustic oscillations should also leave their imprint on the large scale\nstructure of the Universe and thus influence e.g. the correlation function and the power spectrum of galaxies. The first successful detection of these features was presented by Eisenstein\net al. (2005) who found traces of acoustic oscillations in the\ndistribution of luminous red galaxies for which they had excellent measurements of angular positions and redshifts obtained\nby the SDSS collaboration.\nIn this paper we discuss the opportunities that will be\nopened by the planned blank sky deep SZ cluster surveys which\nwill be performed in the coming years. Clusters of galaxies\nare especially interesting objects for the study of acoustic features in the spatial distribution of objects since it has long been\nknown that the clustering of clusters is an order of magnitude\nenhanced in comparison to galaxies (Bahcall & Soneira 1983;\nKaiser 1984). Therefore even with smaller statistics of clusters\nit is possible to get useful results.\nIn the next few years there will be very deep SZ cluster surveys of the restricted regions of the sky performed by several\nprojects, e.g. APEX, 10 SZA, 11 AMI, 12 ACT 13 . Our analysis showed that the volume of these surveys and the number\nof possible cluster detections will be unfortunately insufficient\nfor the search for the acoustic wiggles in the power spectrum.\nHowever, two planned surveys which will be carried out by the\nPLANCK Surveyor 14 spacecraft and the South Pole Telescope\n15\n(SPT) have very good prospects for the detection of acoustic features. PLANCK will make a shallow blank sky cluster\nsurvey permitting one to detect up to 20, 000 rich clusters of\ngalaxies (e.g. Majumdar & Mohr 2004) with the bulk of objects at z < 0.5, but will reach distances of z \u223c 0.8. In contrast\nthe SPT survey will observe deeper, but will cover only 10%\nof the sky. This survey is expected to detect up to 30, 000 clusters of galaxies (Majumdar & Mohr 2004), and many of them\nwill be at significantly higher redshifts compared to the ones\nobserved by PLANCK. Unfortunatelly it is not enough to measure only the SZ flux or brightness of the clusters. In order to\nmeasure the equation of state of DE we need the redshift estimate for each cluster in the sample which will be hard and time\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nhttp://bolo.berkeley.edu/apexsz/\nhttp://astro.uchicago.edu/sza/\nhttp://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/ami/\nhttp://www.hep.upenn.edu/act\nhttp://astro.estec.esa.nl/Planck\nhttp://astro.uchicago.edu/spt\n\nconsuming work for many optical, X-ray and possibly radio\nastronomers. However, when this problem is solved, cosmologists will have a unique sample of clusters of galaxies with\ngood knowledge of their angular position, redshift, and hopefully also mass. In this paper we investigate what limits to the\nDE equation of state might be obtained when these large experimental efforts are completed. It is obvious that in parallel other\nways to measure w(z) will be implemented, but any additional\nand independent information will be useful. Especially important is that PLANCK and SPT surveys of clusters of galaxies\nwill be performed in any case. Certainly, for many various purposes: (i) study of the redshift distribution of clusters, (ii) study\nof the properties of the clusters as a population, (iii) search\nfor high-z clusters etc., we always need to estimate redshift.\nTherefore the information on the power spectrum of clusters\nof galaxies, acoustic wiggles and the subsequent determination\nof w is complementary but extremely important part of these\nsurveys.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2 we describe an analytical model for a cluster power spectrum on a\nlight-cone and calibrate it against the numerical simulations.\nSec. 3 discusses the possibility of detecting baryonic oscillations with the forthcoming SZ surveys. In Sec. 4 we carry out\nparameter forecasting using a Fisher matrix approach and Sec.\n5 contains our conclusions.\n\n2. Light-cone power spectrum of galaxy clusters\nIn this section we present the theoretical model for calculating the cluster power spectrum on our past light-cone. In order\nto assess the accuracy of the theoretical description, we make\ncomparisons with the VIRGO Hubble Volume simulation outputs. We start with a very brief description of the VIRGO simulations and proceed with the calculation of power spectra using\nlight-cone cluster catalogs provided by the VIRGO Consortium\n16\n.\n\n2.1. Cluster power spectra from VIRGO simulations\nWe use outputs from the \u039bCDM Hubble Volume simulation\nthat was run in a 3000 h\u22121 Mpc comoving box with a particle mass of 2.25 * 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 . The other simulation parameters\nwere as follows: \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9b = 0.04, h = 0.7 and\n\u03c38 = 0.9 (for further details see e.g. Evrard et al. 2002). In our\nstudy we used z = 0 snapshot, SphereB and OctantB light-cone\ncatalogs 17 . The z = 0 cluster catalog used a friend-of-friend\nscheme with a linking length b = 0.164 for cluster identification, while for the light-cone outputs the spherical overdensity\nmethod with the overdensity 200 relative to the critical density\nwas applied. The minimum number of particles per cluster is\n30 and 12 for the z = 0 and light-cone catalogs, respectively.\nTo calculate the power spectrum we follow the direct\nmethod of Feldman et al. (1994) (FKP), which is shown to be\noptimal for sufficiently large k\u2212modes i.e. k \u226b 1/L, where L\nis the typical spatial extent of a survey volume (Tegmark et al.\n16\n17\n\nhttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo/\nFor the exact description of these catalogs see Evrard et al.

To this end we use the Triangular Shaped Cloud\n(TSC) (Hockney & Eastwood 1988) mass assignment scheme.\nThus our density field is a filtered version of the underlying\nfield, and as shown in Jing (2005), the real power spectrum P\ncan be expressed as the following sum over aliases (correct\nagain for the case k \u226b 1/L):\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\nN\n\nThe second term on the left-hand side of Eq.(1) is the shot noise\ncontribution and in the case of the TSC filter can be shown to\ngive the following result (Jing 2005):\n\"\n!\n!#\n\u03c0ki\n2\n\u03c0ki\n1 Y\n1 \u2212 sin2\n+\n.\n(5)\nsin4\nSN =\nN i\n2kN\n15\n2kN\n\nSummarized very briefly, our power spectrum calculation consists of the following steps:\n1.

Mass conversion from M200\nto M180 for various redshifts.\n\nThe \"sharpening\" in the last step is done using an iterative\nmethod as described in Jing (2005) with the only difference that\nhere we do not approximate the power spectrum simply with a\npower law, but also allow for a running of the spectral index,\ni.e. we approximate it with a parabola in log-log coordinates.\nWhen calculating the power spectrum in the above described way we assumed that the influence of selection/survey\ngeometry effects on the power spectrum are separable. This is\nnot the case for large scales (k \u223c 1/L) and also if too narrow\n(i.e. \u2206k . 1/L) power spectrum bins are used. In the following\nwe always make the power spectrum binning broad enough so\nthat the neighboring bins can be safely assumed to be uncorrelated.\nThe power spectrum error is estimated using the simple\n\"mode counting\" result of FKP (see also Tegmark et al. 1998):\nr\n\u2206P\n2\n,\n(6)\n=\nP\nVeff Vk\nwhere Vk = 4\u03c0k2 \u2206k/(2\u03c0)3 is the volume of the k\u2212space shell\nand Veff is the effective volume given by:\nhR\ni2\nc\nW 2 (z) dV\ndz dz\nVeff = R\n.\n(7)\nh\ni\n1 2 dVc\nW 4 (z) 1 + n\u0304(z)P\ndz\ndz\n\nHere dVc is a comoving volume element and the weight function:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nconst\nfor volume weighting\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 n\u0304(z)\nfor\nnumber weighting\n(8)\nW(z) \u221d \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 n\u0304(z)\nfor\nan\noptimal\nFKP\nweighting.\n1+n\u0304(z)P\n\nThe halos of the VIRGO Hubble Volume simulations were\nidentified using the spherical overdensity algorithm with an\noverdensity of 200 with respect to the critical density at the\nidentification epoch (Evrard et al. 2002) (we denote the corC\nresponding mass M200\n), while detailed comparisons suggest\nthat the Press-Schechter type of analytical calculations (Press\n& Schechter 1974; Mo & White 1996; Sheth & Tormen 1999;\nSheth et al. 2001) provide a good match to simulations if an\n\n\f4\n\nG.

Here we have used the z = 0 cluster catalog to\nallow for a comparison with the results presented in Colberg\net al. (2000). The lower mass for the cluster selection was\ntaken to be 1.0 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 in order to get the total number\nof objects equal to \u223c 915, 000 as was used in Colberg et al.\n(2000). Also we have selected a spherical volume out of the\nfull box to test how well the geometry correction works. The\nresults of this comparison are given in Fig. 4. We see that the\nColberg et al. (2000) power spectrum agrees with our calculations at the largest scales; however, for the smaller scales it\ndrops below our results. We suspect that their correction for the\ngrid smoothing effect was insufficient, although in their paper\nthey do not describe how the power spectrum was calculated.\nAs can be seen from the figure the shape of our cluster power\nspectrum agrees very well with the linear theory matter power\nspectrum up to the scale k \u223c 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 . Clearly with such a\nlarge number of clusters (\u223c 477, 000 inside our spherical volume) baryonic oscillations are easily detectable and the corresponding \"smooth\" model without them is disfavored.

These results are presented\nin Fig. 5 where the left-hand panels show power spectra divided\nby the smooth model without baryonic oscillations and righthand panels the respective correlation functions. Here the uppermost power spectrum is the same as the one given in Fig. 4.\nSolid/dotted lines show theoretical models with/without baryonic oscillations.

Here DD,\nDR and RR represent the respective normalized data-data, datarandom and random-random pair counts in a given distance\nrange. Random catalogs were generated with ten times the\nnumber of objects in the main catalogs. The survey geometry was again taken to be a spherical volume reaching redshift\nz = 0.58. The number of objects corresponding to the lower\nmass cutoffs of 1.0 * 1014 , 2.0 * 1014 , 3.0 * 1014 , 4.0 * 1014 and\n5.0 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 (friend-of-friend masses) were respectively\n\n476, 634, 167, 898, 80, 811, 45, 836 and 27, 955. For the correlation function we have shown only a simple Poissonian errors:\n1+\u03be\n\u2206\u03be \u2243 \u221a\n.\nDD\n\n(17)\n\n(Errors due to the terms DR and RR can be neglected because\nof the much larger number of available pairs.) These errorbars\nare an underestimate of the true variance, being only exact for\nthe Poissonian point process. To estimate true errors, one needs\nto have a knowledge about the 3- and 4-point correlation function of the clustering pattern. We are not going to elaborate\nfurther on these issues since the following analysis is based\nsolely on the power spectrum. From Fig. 5 we see that baryonic features are visible down to the case with the lowest number of clusters. The only exception is the correlation function\nwith the lowest number of objects which shows rather noisy\nbehavior near the expected baryonic bump. For the least massive systems, due to the nonlinear evolution, the power spectrum starts to rise at k & 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 . For the more massive\nsystems, on the other hand, the opposite trend is visible i.e. a\ndecrease of power. This is due to the cluster formation which\ncan be viewed as a smoothing filter acting on an initial density\nperturbation field.\n\n\f6\n\nG.

SZ clusters and baryonic oscillations\nThe \"concordance\" cosmological model predicts oscillations in\nthe matter power spectrum with a relative amplitude of \u223c 5%\n(see Fig. 7). The correspondance of the peaks in the matter\npower spectrum to the ones in the CMB angular power spectrum is also given in Fig. 7 (The first vertical line represents\nthe position of the 1st CMB acoustic peak etc.). We see that\non small scales the corresponding features are out of phase.\nThis is due to the so-called velocity overshoot, meaning that at\nthose scales the growing mode of density fluctuations is mostly\nsourced by the velocity perturbations (Sunyaev & Zeldovich\n1970; Eisenstein & Hu 1998). At larger scales, on the other\nhand, fluctuations in the density provide a dominant source\nterm and so the corresponding features in the power spectra are\nin phase. Each rise and fall in the matter power spectrum corresponds to twice as many features in the CMB angular spectrum.\nThis is a generic property of the models with a dominating\nCDM component. Purely baryonic models on the other hand\nwould have oscillations with the same frequency as in the angular spectrum of the CMB. 18 In order to see these features in\nthe matter power spectrum one needs a \"tracer\" population of\nobjects whose clustering properties with respect to the underlying dark matter distribution are reasonably well understood.\nThese objects should have high enough number density to reduce discreteness noise on one hand, but on the other hand they\nshould fill as large of a comoving volume as possible to decrease cosmic variance. In general one wants to find an optimal\n\nM180 > 5.0 1013 (771961 halos)\nM180 > 1.0 1014 (274905 halos)\nM180 > 3.0 1014 (33917 halos)\n0.01\n\nPLC(k) [h-3 Mpc3]\n\nD+ (z) is the growing mode of linear density fluctuations normalized such that D+ (z = 0) = 1 and P(k, z = 0) is the matter\npower spectrum at the current epoch, which is calculated using\nthe transfer functions presented in Eisenstein & Hu (1998).\nFor the mass function n(M, z) and bias parameter b(M, z) we\nuse both Press-Schechter (PS) (Press & Schechter 1974) and\nSheth-Tormen (ST) (Sheth & Tormen 1999) prescriptions. It is\nwell known that PS mass function underpredicts the number\ndensity of massive objects (Sheth & Tormen 1999). PS overestimates while ST underestimates the bias parameter for massive\nhalos (especially at larger redshifts) (Sheth & Tormen 1999).\nPS underestimation of number density turns out to be approximately compensated for by its overestimation of bias parameter, and as such, we get the best agreement with the numerical light-cone power spectra using a plain PS approach. This\nis demonstrated in Fig. 6 where we show the light-cone power\nspectra for various values of lower mass cutoff Mlow . Results in\nthe upper panel apply for the SphereB cluster catalog (reaching\nredshift z \u223c 0.58) whereas the ones on the lower part of the\nfigure correspond to the OctantB catalog (reaching z \u223c 1.46) of\nVIRGO Hubble Volume simulation outputs. We obtained the\nbest agreement if clusters were selected using M180 , but in bias\ncalculations virial mass Mvir was used instead.\nOverall the agreement between the numerical results and\nan analytical description is better than 20%.\n\n7\n\nM180 > 5.0 1013 (328261 halos)\nM180 > 1.0 1014 (94485 halos)\nM180 > 3.0 1014 (7920 halos)\n0.01\n\n0.1\nk [h Mpc-1]\n\nFig. 6.

Future projects such as the K.A.O.S.20\ngalaxy redshift survey has as one of its main scientific targets\nthe detection of baryon oscillations in the spatial clustering of\nhigh\u2212z galaxies. The possibility of using the aforementioned\ngalaxy redshift surveys to measure the sound horizon has been\ndiscussed in several papers e.g. Blake & Glazebrook (2003);\nLinder (2003); Seo & Eisenstein (2003); Hu & Haiman (2003)\nand a similar discussion in the context of photometric redshift\nsurveys is given in Blake & Bridle (2005) (see also the discussion in Seo & Eisenstein 2003).\n19\nOne also has to consider the steepness of the luminosity function\nof those objects.\n20\nhttp://www.noao.edu/kaos/\n\n\f8\n\nG.

Theoretical dark matter power spectra with a smooth component divided out (using transfer functions as given by Eisenstein &\nHu (1998)) for the WMAP \"concordance\" model (solid line) and for\nthe model used in VIRGO Hubble Volume simulations (dashed line).\nThe numbered vertical lines show the locations of the corresponding\npeaks in the CMB angular power spectrum e.g. 1. corresponds to the\n1st acoustic peak etc.\n\nHere instead of galaxies we discuss the possibility of using\nSZ-selected galaxy clusters for that purpose. Some calculations\nrelated to the SPT-type of SZ survey were also presented in Hu\n& Haiman (2003). It is clear from Figs. 4 and 7 that with wide\nfield galaxy cluster surveys we should be especially sensitive\nto the scales that correspond to the 2nd and 3rd acoustic peaks\nin the CMB angular power spectrum.\nA few advantages of using galaxy clusters compared to the\ngalaxies are:\n\u2013 With relatively small cluster samples it is possible to probe\nlarge cosmological volumes (thus reducing cosmic variance).\n\u2013 The clustering signal of galaxy clusters is amplified with\nrespect that of galaxies.\n\u2013 The relation with respect to the underlying dark matter field\nis rather well understood and also redshift space distortions\nare managable since \"fingers of god\" could be avoided.21\nThe biggest disadvantage is a rather low number density i.e.\nhigh shot noise contribution.\n\n3.1. SZ-selected clusters. Mass-observable relations\nIn order to compare observations with the models one has to\nestablish mass-observable relations and also specify survey se21\n\nThis is only true when we have enough galaxy redshifts per cluster, so that one can average down to something close to the center of\nmass velocity. One might also try to exploit the fact that the bright\ncentral cD galaxies have small velocities with respect to the rest of\nthe cluster (see the simulation results by Berlind et al. (2003)). Even\nif one is able to find a good estimate for the center of mass velocity\nfor each cluster in the sample, the redshift space distortions on reasonably large scales would still deviate from the simple linear prediction\n(Scoccimarro 2004).\n\nwhere I0 = 2(kT cmb )3 /(hc)2 \u2243 2.7 * 1011 mJy/sr, fb is the cluster\nbaryonic fraction which we take to be equal to the cosmic average \u03a9b /\u03a9m , dA (z) is angular diameter distance to the cluster,\n\u03bce = 2/(1 + X) for the case of fully ionized plasma with negligible metallicity (we take \u03bce = 1.14). The spectral function\ng(x) is given as follows (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1980):\n\u0014\n\u0015\nx\nx4 ex\ng(x) = x coth( ) \u2212 4 * x\n,\n2\n(e \u2212 1)2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the dimensionless frequency x = h\u03bd/kT cmb \u2243 0.0176 *\n\u03bd(GHz). For the mass-temperature relation we assume a simple\nvirial scaling (Bryan & Norman 1998):\nh\ni1 2\nkT (M, z) = A * \u2206c (z)E(z)2 3 M 3 .\n\n(24)\n\nHere \u2206c (z) is a critical collapse overdensity with respect to the\ncritical density at redshift z and E(z) = H(z)/H0 . The normalizing constant A is determined so as to obtain a good match for\nthe SZ cluster number counts from the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations by White et al. (2002). These simulations\nincluded gas cooling processes and also feedback from supernovae and galactic winds. If we measure kT in keV and M in\nunits of h\u22121 M\u2299 , then a good fit can be obtained if A \u2243 1.0*10\u221210\nas seen in Fig. 8. Here we present results both for ST and PS\nmass functions.\nIn reality the mass-observable relations are currently rather\npoorly known but one may argue that planned surveys with the\nyields of tens of thousands of galaxy clusters have significant\npower for \"self-calibration\" (Majumdar & Mohr 2004). As also\nshown in Majumdar & Mohr (2004) a much better approach\nwould be to establish these scaling laws using external mass\ndeterminations (e.g. through lensing studies) for a subset of a\ncomplete sample. For a more precise modeling of the selection\neffects one also has to consider scatter around these mean relations. These issues can be settled once we obtain a real sample.\nMoreover, the clustering as compared to the number count of\nobjects is much less sensitive to the uncertainties in the precise\nknowledge of the selection effects. Here the selection effects\nenter when relating the clustering of tracer objects to the underlying dark matter i.e. while determining the effective bias of\nobjects. As it turns out (see Sec. 4), future large cluster samples are able to provide a good estimate of the effective bias\nthemselves through the redshift space distortions.\n\n\fG.

(6))\nand for the number of detectable clusters are given in Fig. 9.\nHere the upper panel assumes full sky coverage and the lower\none applies for one octant of the sky. With the solid lines we\nhave plotted the fractional accuracy \u2206P/P achieved for different lower flux limits and follow-up survey depths applying the\nFKP weighting scheme. The wavenumber k in the calculations\nwas taken to be 0.05 h Mpc\u22121 , which is close to the first major acoustic feature in the expected matter power spectrum (see\nFig. 7). The bin width \u2206k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121 is large enough so\nthat even for the shallowest surveys reaching only z \u223c 0.2 the\npower spectrum bins can be assumed to be independent. Here\nand also in the following we perform analytical calculations\nfor the observational frequency 150 GHz and assume cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP \"concordance\"\nmodel (Spergel et al. 2003).\nLight-cone power spectra for SZ clusters are calculated using Eq. (18) where the lower integration boundary Mlow (F, z)\nis given by Eq. (22) and (24). Then \u2206P/P is found using Eq.\n(6),(7) and (8) and the mean underlying number density n\u0304(z) is\ngiven by Eq. (19). Also we have taken into account the increase\nof the isotropized power spectrum due to linear redshift space\ndistortions by a factor of 1 + 2\u03b2/3 + \u03b22 /5 (Kaiser 1987), where\n\u03b2 = b1eff * ddlnlnDa+ .\nThe solid lines in Fig. 9 starting from below correspond to\n\u2206P/P values of 6%, 5%, 4%, . . . in the upper panel and 10%,\n9%, 8%, . . . in the lower one.

Lower\npanel: the same as above only for one octant of the sky.\n\nimposed lower mass cutoff 1.0 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Thus below some\nflux limit we see all the clusters inside a specified volume that\nhave masses above that cutoff value.\nIn general, by increasing the volume of the survey we also\nboost the shot noise contribution due to the decreasing number density of distant objects. As seen from the figure- in the\ncase of FKP weighting- the accuracy of power spectrum estimate does not degrade as we move to further distances since we\ndownweight the contribution of the far away objects in such a\nway as to compensate for the increase in shot noise. For too\nsmall survey volumes, on the other hand, limits on achievable\naccuracy are set by the growing importance of the cosmic variance. The FKP weighting scheme is not strictly optimal in our\ncase since it was derived assuming a fixed i.e. non-evolving\nunderlying power spectrum. Certainly, for a better scheme one\nshould weight down the contribution of the far away objects\nslightly more mildly since the clustering strength of these objects is higher. This type of weighting method, which is able\nto handle at least the case with an evolving amplitude, is presented in Percival et al. (2004). Nevertheless in the following\n\n\fG. H\u00fctsi: Clustering of SZ clusters\n\n22\nUsing the spectral dependence of thermal SZ effect (see Eq. (23))\nwe see that the 30 mJy sensitivity of PLANCK's 353 GHz channel\ncorresponds to 17 mJy at 153 GHz.\n\n0.08\n0.075\n0.07\n0.065\n\n\u2206P/P\n\ncalculations for simplicity we still apply the FKP weight function.\nThe results in Fig. 9 assumed that we have a full follow-up\nsuch that we are able to obtain all the redshifts of the clusters detected by an imaging survey. Also the sample was assumed to be purely flux-selected which is rather unrealistic for\nreal experiments e.g. for PLANCK many clusters remain undetected due to rather poor angular resolution or oppositely in the\ncase of SPT some fraction of clusters will be \"resolved out\"\nand a significant amount of signal will be lost. Many objects\nmight remain undetected for these reasons. If the systems that\nare left out are low mass clusters (as in the case of PLANCK)\nthen our power spectrum estimate might actually be almost as\ngood as before since low mass systems are relatively weakly\nclustered and as such they do not contribute significantly to\nthe total signal. This can be seen in Fig. 10 where in the upper panel we have shown the influence of changing the lower\nmass cutoff Mlow on \u2206P/P. On the lower panel the respective\nnumber of clusters is given. These calculations are done for\ntwo different survey types: (1) solid lines represent results for\na shallow SZ survey covering the full sky and reaching redshift zlim = 0.6 with a sensitivity limit Flow = 17 mJy at 150\nGHz, (2) dashed lines represent a deep survey (with no upper\nredshift cutoff imposed) covering 1/8 of the sky with a flux\nlimit Flow = 5 mJy at 150 GHz. The first might be applicable for the case of the PLANCK mission22 and the second for\nthe SPT cluster survey. In practice the measurements will be\nperformed in many frequency channels which helps to separate clusters from other foreground sources due to the specific\nfrequency behavior of the thermal SZ effect. Here for simplicity we have chosen the sensitivity limits corresponding to the\n\"weakest\" of the channels available for SZ purposes. We see\nthat for a full sky with the 20, 000 most massive clusters up\nto redshift z \u223c 0.6, one could obtain an estimate of the power\nspectrum at k = 0.05 h Mpc\u22121 with a fractional error below 5%\nwhile for the one octant of the sky with less than \u223c 25, 000\nclusters we always stay above 5% accuracy.\nThe previously described approach where we use all the\ndata to obtain a single combined estimate of the power spectrum is appropriate if we only intend to place constraints on\n\u03a9DE . Combining this power spectrum estimate which is sensitive to \u03a9m h with the CMB constraint on \u03a9m h2 gives us \u03a9m\nand h separately. Additionally, knowing the geometry of the\nUniverse from CMB measurements gives us immediately an\nestimate of \u03a9DE . Since in the majority of the DE models DE\nstarts to dominate relatively recently, driving the Universe furthest from the plain Einstein-de Sitter behavior, the best redshift to complement the CMB data is at z = 0.\nOn the other hand if our aim is to constrain the equation\nof state parameter w and its possible change in time it is essential to measure the power spectrum at different redshifts.\nThis leads to the question of how to bin up the sample in\nredshift? Certainly there are optimal ways of combining data,\nbut unfortunately they all depend on the way we choose to\n\n0.06\n0.055\n0.05\n0.045\n0.04\n\n45000\n40000\n35000\n\nN\n\n10\n\n30000\n25000\n20000\n15000\n10000\n1e+14\n\n1.5e+14\n\n2e+14\n\n2.5e+14\n3e+14\nMlow\n\n3.5e+14\n\n4e+14\n\n4.5e+14\n\nFig. 10. \u2206P/P (upper panel) and number of clusters (lower panel) as\na function of the lower mass cutoff Mlow . Solid lines correspond to\nthe full sky shallow SZ survey and dashed lines to the deep survey\ncovering one octant of the sky.\n\nparametrize our model for DE. Recently Huterer & Starkman\n(2003) argued that in the absence of a theoretically well motivated parametrization one should use a stepwise function with\nthe value wi in the i-th redshift bin and let the data itself determine which combinations of wi will be well constrained. One\ncan then reconstruct the behavior of w with the redshift as a linear combination of the \"cleanest\" eigenmodes. Here we are not\ntrying to implement that kind of general parametrization since\nas a first step it should be sufficient to determine an effective\nconstant w and see whether it deviates from the currently most\nwell motivated w = \u22121. Therefore, in the following we mostly\ninvestigate the case with a constant equation of state parameter\nw0 . The redshift binning is chosen so as to get equal relative accuracies of the power spectrum in each bin. The results of this\nbinning procedure for the above described two types of survey\nare given in Fig. 11 with the solid lines corresponding to the\nshallow one. For the shallow (deep) survey we have assumed 3\n(4) redshift bins. In the inset the upper curves show the relative\naccuracy achievable in each redshift bin while the lower lines\ncorrespond to the full sample without any binning and so coincide with the lines shown in the upper panel of Fig. 10.

Prospects of detecting baryonic \"wiggles\".\nComparison with SDSS LRG\nThe relative amplitude of acoustic oscillations in the mater\npower spectrum for the WMAP \"concordance\" model as well\nas in the power spectrum used in VIRGO Hubble Volume simulations is shown in Fig. 7. Here the smooth component was\ndivided out using the fitting formulae provided by Eisenstein\n& Hu (1998). In order to be able to detect these features the accuracy of the power spectrum determination should be of comparable size i.e. \u2206P/P \u223c 5%. This implies that for a full sky\nsurvey one needs on the order of 25, 000 galaxy clusters inside the volume with limiting redshift z \u223c 0.6 as seen from the\nupper panel of Fig. 10. It is clear that with clusters one might\nhope to detect only the first few acoustic signatures, e.g. the\nmajor features at k \u223c 0.045 and \u223c 0.075 h Mpc\u22121 , since they\nare too rare objects to enable the sampling of the smaller scale\ndensity field.\nSince the study of the SDSS LRG sample has led to the\ndetection of acoustic oscillations in the spatial distribution of\ngalaxies (Eisenstein et al. 2005), 23 it would be instructive to\ncompare the \"strength\" of this survey to the planned blank sky\nSZ cluster surveys like PLANCK and SPT. In Fig. 12 we show\nthe number density of clusters as a function of redshift for the\nabove described two types of SZ survey. The upper group of\nlines corresponds to the SPT-like deep survey while the lower\ncurves are for a wide and shallow survey like PLANCK. For\neach of the surveys we have varied the lower mass cutoff Mlow\nso as to obtain in total 15, 000, 25, 000 and 35, 000 clusters.\nThese three cases are shown with solid lines. Dashed lines display the pure flux-limited surveys without any lower cutoff in\nthe mass imposed.

Solid lines in each set correspond to the cases with\n15, 000,25, 000 and 35, 000 clusters. The vertical dotted line shows the\napplied upper limiting redshift for the PLANCK. Dashed lines represent purely flux-limited cases i.e. without any lower mass cuttoff imposed.\n\ncount the proper biasing factors as given by the square root\nof Eq. (18) divided by P(k, z = 0) 24 we can readily obtain\n\u2206P/P as given by Eq. (6) and (7). The results of this calculation are given in Fig. 13. Here the solid lines correspond to the\nPLANCK-like and dashed ones to the SPT-like surveys. Each\nset of lines corresponds to the detected cluster numbers (starting from above): 15, 000, 25, 000 and 35, 000. The dash-dotted\ncurve, showing the results for the SDSS LRG sample, is found\nusing Eq. (6) and the data for the effective volume given in\nFig. 1 of Eisenstein et al. (2005) (again \u2206k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121\nwas assumed). We can see that on large scales future SZ surveys have enough strength to improve the results obtained using the SDSS LRG sample. However, the SDSS LRG sample is going to double in size within a few years as the survey is completed. The achievable \u2206P/P for this final sample is shown in Fig. 13 as a dotted line. Moreover, it seems\nthat acoustic oscillations are able to survive at the quasilinear\nscales (k \u223c 0.1 . . . 0.3 h Mpc\u22121 ) (see Fig. 4) which significantly\nincreases the amount of information available for the galaxy\nredshift surveys. This is also confirmed by the recent N-body\nsimulations by Springel et al. (2005) and Seo & Eisenstein\n(2005). In order to fully exploit this information one needs a\ncomplete theoretical understanding of how nonlinear effects,\nredshift space distortions and nonlinear biasing influence these\nfeatures. So far there have been only a few works studying these\nimportant issues (e.g. Meiksin et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2005;\nSeo & Eisenstein 2005; White 2005) and we do not have a full\ntheoretical description of them available yet. For this reason we\nhave not attempted to incorporate the SDSS LRG sample into\nour Fisher matrix parameter estimation process.\n24\nThe light-cone bias parameters calculated this way are 5.0,4.7,4.3\nfor the PLANCK and 4.4,4.1,3.9 for the SPT with the number of clusters 15, 000,25, 000 and 35, 0000, respectively.\n\n\f12\n\nG. H\u00fctsi: Clustering of SZ clusters\n\nters of galaxies, we can estimate the accuracy with which it is\npossible to recover cosmological parameters.

Comparison of the \"strength\" of the future SZ cluster surveys\nwith respect to the SDSS LRG. Lines shown for the PLANCK- and\nSPT-like surveys correspond to the detected cluster numbers (starting\nfrom above): 15, 000, 25, 000 and 35, 000.\n\n3.4. Some remarks on SZ vs. optical cluster selection\nSZ cluster selection might be superior to the simple optical\none since SZ brightness does not suffer from ordinary cosmological dimming. This allows one to obtain an approximately\nmass-limited sample of clusters that is spatially much more\nuniform than optically selected samples. For example, in Fig.\n12 the number density of clusters for both PLANCK (up to\nz \u223c 0.6) and the SPT type of surveys drops approximately as\n\u221d z\u22122.5 . In contrast, the number density of the optically selected\nSDSS LRG sample (which contains mostly galaxies that populate dense cluster environments) drops as \u221d z\u22125 beyond z \u223c 0.3.\nSo in general with SZ-selected clusters one is able to probe\nlarger volumes. Also as a larger part of the sample is at higher\nredshifts the clustering signal is stronger due to the increase of\nthe bias factor with increasing distance. (Of course the question of whether these far away parts of the sample have high\nenough number density in order to be useful for the clustering\nstudy depends on the specific parameters of the experiment.)\nThe other weaknesses of the optical selection are projection\neffects and confusion with the background objects. As an example, comparison of the X-ray and optically selected cluster\ncatalogues often yields a rather poor match (e.g. Donahue et al.\n2002), which probably signals that many of the \"optically constructed\" systems are actually false detections.\nFor the SZ surveys the spectroscopic follow-up is a crucial\nissue, but several other studies (such as cluster number counts)\nalso require determination of redshifts. As these investigations\nwill be performed anyway, the clustering study can be seen as\ncoming esentially \"for free\".\n\n1. The increase of power along the line of sight due to the\nlarge scale coherent inflows towards massive accretion centers. This effect is accounted for using results from linear\ntheory.\n2. Cosmological distortion due to the fact that one can directly\nobserve only redshifts, and in order to find the corresponding comoving distances, one has to assume some cosmological model. Choosing an incorrect model will lead to\ndistortions along and perpendicular to the line of sight 25 .\nBoth of these effects will, in general, lead to an anisotropic\npower spectrum. Thus instead of a one dimensional\n(isotropized) power spectrum one has to consider here a two\ndimensional power spectrum with components along and perpendicular to the line of sight. For simplicity, in the following\nwe use a flat sky approximation. The 2D power spectra are calculated following the description given in Magira et al.

The contours starting from the upper right corner correspond to the\nvalues 104.8 and 104.7 for the upper and lower panel, respectively and the step size was taken 100.1 h\u22123 Mpc3 . It is clearly\nseen how linear redshift-space distortion boosts power along\nthe line of sight. The cosmological distortion (in the currently\nselected reference model) on the other hand works in the opposite way. Since the chosen Milne model is strongly different\nfrom the \u039bCDM \"concordance\" model the cosmological distortion is easily visible. We use Milne's model only for illustrative purposes but in the following parameter estimation part\nwe change the reference model to the WMAP \"concordance\"\ncosmology. On the right-hand panels of the figure we have removed the smooth component of the power spectrum revealing\nthe series of acoustic rings. Here the continuous contours correspond to PLC,2D /PLC,2D\nsmooth values of 0.95 and 1.05 while the\ndashed lines are for the values 0.97 and 1.03. It is important to\nnote that the picture on both panels looks practically the same.\nThis is due to the fact that cosmological and redshift-space distortions work in a different way: cosmological transformation\nstretches or compresses the power spectra on the plane of the\n\nfigure whereas redshift distortion moves the spectra in a vertical direction. If we had smooth power spectra without any particular features then it would be extremely hard to disentangle\nthese two types of distortions. Having the power spectra with\nacoustic features it is easy to isolate cosmological distortion by\ndividing out a smooth component. The ability to disentangle\ncosmological and redshift-space distortions is extremely important to extract the bias parameter from the survey in a selfconsistent way. In the parameter estimation part of this section\nwe see how much better one does with the model having acoustic oscillations as compared to the one without.\n\nThe total power spectrum measured over a broad z-interval\nis a weighted sum of differently distorted power spectra and\nso there will be some loss of acoustic features. The loss is\nstronger along the line of sight, as can be seen from Fig. 14.\nThis is due to the currently chosen reference model where\ndc (z)\n\u22a5 (z)\n| dzk | > | dcdz\n|. Again, this effect is strongly pronounced because Milne's model differs strongly from the WMAP \"concordance\" cosmology for which our calculation was done.\n\n\fG.

Parameter estimation\nIn this subsection we apply a Fisher matrix forecasting techniques to study how well one can determine cosmological parameters. Since the pioneering investigations in the field of\nCMB anisotropies (Jungman et al. 1996) and galaxy redshift\nsurveys (Tegmark 1997) these methods have gained great popularity. For a full description of the method with applications see\nTegmark et al. (1997). Following Tegmark (1997) the Fisher\nmatrix in the case of a 2D power spectrum can be written as\n(see also Hu & Haiman (2003)):\nFij =\n\nXX\nn\n\nm\n\n\u2202 ln PLC,2D (kkn , k\u22a5m )\n*\n\u2202\u0398i\nVkm Veff \u2202 ln PLC,2D (kkn , k\u22a5m )\n,\n*\n2\n\u2202\u0398j\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\nVkn =\n\n4\u03c0k\u22a5n \u2206k\u22a5 \u2206kk\n,\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(35)\n\nand we take \u2206k\u22a5 = \u2206kk = \u2206k. PLC,2D is given in Eq. (31) and\nVeff in Eq. (7). The wavevector components kki and k\u22a5j form\na rectangular grid with a step size \u2206k. We allow them to span\nthe range 0.005 . . . 0.1 h Mpc\u22121 and take \u2206k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121\n\ni.e. we have a 20x20 grid. It is not justified to go to higher\nwavenumbers than 0.1 h Mpc\u22121 since there already the simple\nlinear scaling of the cluster power spectrum seems to break\ndown (see Fig. 6). The parameters \u0398i are taken to be \u03a9m , \u03c38 ,\n\u03a9b , h, w0 plus the bias parameters bn in each redshift bin. Thus\nin the case of four redshift bins (which is the maximum number considered in our analysis) we have a total of nine free parameters. We also assume a fiducial cosmology given by the\nbest-fit WMAP \"concordance\" model (Spergel et al. 2003) plus\nthe dark energy in the form of the cosmological constant i.e.\nw = \u22121.\nHere we perform calculations for two types of SZ survey.\nThe first one that should serve as a prototype for PLANCK is\na shallow survey that covers the full sky with a sensitivity limit\nof Flow = 30 mJy at 353 GHz 27 . We also apply a lower mass\ncutoff of Mlow = 2.75 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 resulting in total \u223c 25, 000\nclusters up to the applied limiting redshift z \u2243 0.6 (see Fig.\n10 lower panel). The calculations are done for one redshift bin\nspanning z = 0 . . . 0.58 and also for three bins: z1 = 0 . . . 0.33,\nz2 = 0.33 . . . 0.45, z3 = 0.45 . . . 0.58. The achieved \u2206P/P values at k = 0.05 h Mpc\u22121 are 4.3% for the one bin case and\n7.5% for each of the bins in the three bin case. The other\ndeep and rather \"narrow\" survey should mimic the performance\n27\n\nhttp://astro.estec.esa.nl/Planck\n\n\f16\n\nG.

Upper panel: Error ellipses under various assumptions for the\nPLANCK-like survey. Here we have shown the following cases: 1.\nClustering signal of the model without baryonic oscillations + CMB\npriors, 2. #1 + prior on bias, 3. Clustering signal of the \"wiggly\"\nmodel, 4. #3 + CMB priors, 5. #4 + prior on bias. Lower panel: as\nabove, except for the SPT-like survey and with a changed order of the\ncases #2 and #3. Lower panel inset: constraints obtainable with: 1.\nSPT, 2. PLANCK, 3. SPT + PLANCK, 4. The survey with SPT characteristics covering the full sky. All of the cases here have CMB and\nbias priors added.\n\nof SPT. Here we have taken Flow = 5 mJy at 150 GHz and\nMlow = 1.5 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 (see Ruhl et al. (2004); Majumdar &\nMohr (2004)). Moreover, we assumed that the survey is capable of covering one octant of the sky and here we have not applied any high redshift cutoff. As for the PLANCK-like survey\ntwo different cases are considered here. In the first case while\ncombining all the data to one common power spectrum we are\nable to achieve \u2206P/P \u2243 5.1%, whereas in the second case\nwith the four redshift bins: z1 = 0 . . . 0.45, z2 = 0.45 . . . 0.63,\nz3 = 0.63 . . . 0.83, z4 = 0.83 . . . we find a \u2206P/P \u2243 9.9% in each\nredshift bin. The total number of objects detected with this type\nof survey would be \u223c 27, 000.\nThe results in Fig. 15 and 16 present constraints for the five\ncosmological parameters: \u03a9m , \u03c38 , \u03a9b , h and w0 . Here we have\nadded priors to \u03a9m h2 and \u03a9b h2 from the CMB angular power\n\nspectrum studies, and also a prior to the bias parameters. In\norder to be able to compare our results to the ones given in\nHu & Haiman (2003) the fractional errors of 0.01 for \u03a9m h2\nand \u03a9b h2 (this should be achievable with the PLANCK mission (Hu 2002)) were similarly assumed. These constraints are\neasily \"rotated\" to the frame used here since under coordinate\ntransformations the Fisher matrix transforms as a second rank\ntensor. Moreover, we have restricted our calculations to the flat\nmodels only, and for the bias have assumed that one is able to\ndescribe it with a relative accuracy of 15%. Finally, the joint\nFisher matrix is the sum of all the Fisher matrices transformed\nto a common frame. All the calculations done here assume an\nunderlying model with baryonic features in the matter power\nspectrum. Fig. 15 presents results for the previously described\nshallow survey with full sky coverage while the error ellipses\nin Fig. 16 apply to the deep and narrow survey. In both figures dashed lines correspond to the single and solid lines to the\nmultiple bin case. Due to the fact that with a single bin one is\nable to measure the shape of the power spectrum with a higher\nprecision than in the case of multiple bins, we see from the\nabove figures that in general stronger constraints on \u03a9m are obtained. On the other hand constraints on w0 are much stronger\nin the multiple bin case due to the increased knowledge about\nthe redshift derivatives. We also performed calculations taking\ntwo redshift bins and the results were already rather close to\nthe solid curves in the figures above which can be interpreted\nas an indication that any further redshift slicing would not improve constraints on w0 . Also one should not increase the number of redshift bins much above the maximally used values\nof three and four since then the wavevector bins with width\n\u2206k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121 would become highly correlated and the\nabove Fisher matrix calculation would not be meaningful.\nProbably the most interesting constraints in Fig. 15 and 16\nare the ones for \u03a9m (or \u03a9DE since we have assumed flat models)\nand w0 . Error ellipses in the \u03a9m -w0 plane are also given in Fig.\n17 for various different assumptions. The top panel here corresponds to the PLANCK-type and the lower one to the SPTtype of survey. The order of ellipses in the top panel starting\nfrom the bottommost one is as follows: (1) clustering signal of\nthe model without baryonic oscillations + CMB priors, (2) (1)\n+ prior on bias, (3) clustering signal of the \"wiggly\" model,\n(4) (3) + CMB priors, (5) (4) + prior on bias. The only difference in the lower panel is the reversed order of (2) and (3).\nThe inset in the lower plot displays the constraints obtainable\n(again starting from the bottommost ellipse) with (1) SPT, (2)\nPLANCK, (3) SPT + PLANCK, (4) the survey with SPT characteristics covering the full sky. For all of the cases shown in\nthe inset we have included CMB and bias priors. The constraint\nellipses for the \"clustering only\" case assuming a \"smooth\"\nmodel would fill almost all the plot area and for the sake of clarity we have not displayed them here. It is evident from Fig. 17\nthat the model with baryonic oscillations is performing much\nbetter compared to its smoothed counterpart. Adding prior information (in contrast to the \"smooth\" case) does not result\nhere in a strong improvement i.e. the clustering signal alone\nalready has a significant constraining power.\nTable 1 lists the principal components of the clustering\nanalysis only i.e. no CMB and bias priors included.

Comparison to previous work\nProbably the two closest works to ours are Majumdar & Mohr\n(2004) and Hu & Haiman (2003). In Majumdar & Mohr (2004)\nthe authors discuss constraints obtainable by combining the\ncluster power spectrum with independent information from\ncluster number counts. Unfortunately they do not present results separately for the clustering signal only. Moreover, they\nuse an isotropized power spectrum which leads to a significant loss of information, especially when the spectra contain\nbaryonic features. In Hu & Haiman (2003) the authors use the\nfull 2D power spectrum of galaxy clusters although they do not\ntake into account light-cone effects. Since the light-cone power\nspectrum is a blend of differently deformed power spectra (if\nwe are away from the reference model point) some loss of baryonic features will result as seen from Fig. 14. Also in their analysis they used k-modes up to 0.15 as opposed to our adopted\nvalue of 0.1 h Mpc\u22121 . As seen from Fig. 6 at k = 0.15 h Mpc\u22121\nthe cluster power spectrum already differs quite significantly\nfrom the simple linear one, particularly for the more massive\nsystems. To simplify the comparison our results with Hu &\nHaiman (2003), we used identical CMB priors. An additional\ndifference is that we do not allow the spectral index of the\npower spectrum to vary but keep it fixed to n = 1. In total\ntheir results for the SPT-type of survey are significantly more\noptimistic, e.g. the constraints on w0 agree roughly with our\n\nei5\n0.090\n\u22120.58\n\u22120.56\n0.26\n\u22120.53\n0.21\n0.87\n\u22120.13\n\u22120.41\n0.12\n0.13\n\u22120.70\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.60\n0.22\n\nSPT+PLANCK case, however, in the case of \u03a9m an approximate agreement is achieved with our SPT full sky example.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we studied the clustering of SZ-selected galaxy\nclusters on a past light-cone with particular emphasis on constraining the properties of DE. We implemented an extended\nPress-Schechter type of analytical model as described e.g. in\nSheth & Tormen (1999). The description of the calculation\nof the light-cone power spectra (e.g. Yamamoto et al. 1999)\nwas modified slightly to incorporate other than simple number weighting schemes. The analytical model was extensively\ncalibrated using the outputs from the VIRGO Consortium's\nHubble Volume simulations. With a little bit of fine tuning we\nwere able to match analytical light-cone power spectra with\nones extracted from the simulations to an accuracy better than\n20%. The SZ scaling relations were calibrated so as to get a\ngood match to the number count results from the state-of-theart hydrodynamical simulations of White et al. (2002). Having\na well calibrated analytical model we investigated how accurately future SZ surveys like PLANCK and SPT could determine the cluster power spectrum and whether they would be\nable to detect traces of baryonic oscillations. Also we made\nuse of VIRGO simulation outputs to build cluster catalogs for\nvarious survey depths and sensitivity limits. We showed that\nthe aforementioned blank sky SZ surveys will be able to improve the detection of acoustic features based on the SDSS\nLRG sample. To obtain a high-fidelity detection of the baryonic oscillations, one has to reach a relative accuracy \u223c 5% if\nthe wavenumber bin width \u2206k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121 is used. This\nseems hard to achieve with surveys like SPT still having relatively narrow sky coverage. On the other hand, for surveys with\na wide sky coverage the prospects seem to be better e.g. with\n\u223c 25, 000 most massive clusters up to redshift \u223c 0.6 one should\nbe able to reach a relative accuracy \u223c 4.5% at k = 0.05 h Mpc\u22121\ni.e. roughly the scale where one expects to see the first major\nacoustic feature.\n\n\f18\n\nG. H\u00fctsi: Clustering of SZ clusters\n\nIn the last part of the paper we carried out a Fisher matrix\nforecasting analysis for cosmological parameters, which add up\nto nine in the case of four redshift bins: \u03a9m , \u03c38 , \u03a9b , h, w0 plus a\nfree bias parameter for each bin. We included prior information\nfor \u03a9m h2 and \u03a9b h2 from CMB angular power spectrum studies\nand also constrained the possible values for the bias parameters. A prior on bias parameters only has a significant effect\nin the case of models with smooth power spectra i.e. models\nwith acoustic oscillations have enough constraining power to\ngive an estimate of bias parameters from the survey itself. The\nmost interesting constraints are obtained for \u03a9m and w0 . Wide\nand rather shallow surveys like PLANCK in combination with\na CMB prior on \u03a9m h2 are able to provide strong constraints on\n\u03a9m or in the case of flat models equivalently on \u03a9DE = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m .\nThe constraints on w0 on the other hand are not as good as the\nones obtained by deeper and narrower surveys with the characteristics of SPT due to the lack of higher redshift objects. We\nalso give our results as the principal components of the Fisher\nmatrix that should allow for an easy way of comparison and\nalso for a fast way of incorporating these constraints into further parameter forecasting studies.\nAcknowledgements.
