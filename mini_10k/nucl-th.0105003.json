The most powerful MFA is the Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov (HFB)\ntheory, where particle-hole and particle-particle correlations are taken into account at the same foot. The success of this simple approach is based on the\nlarge variational Hilbert space generated by symmetry breaking wave functions. For an atomic nucleus and in the most general HFB approach as many\nsymmetries as possible, in particular the rotational invariance and the particle\nnumber symmetries are broken. In these approaches the quantum numbers are\nonly conserved on the average, a semiclassical approach to the full quantum\n1\n2\n\nDedicated to Prof. Peter Ring on the occasion of his 60th birthday.\nPresent address: Dipartamento di Fisica, Universita di Lecce, 73100 Lecce, Italy.\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n13 November 2018\n\n\frequirement to the wave function of being an eigenstate of the symmetry operators. It is well known [1] that the plain HFB approach works well in the case of\na strongly correlated regime and with a large number of nucleons participating\nin the symmetry breaking process. In the case of the rotational invariance, the\nideal situation is represented by a strongly deformed heavy nucleus where a\nlarge number of nucleons contribute to the collective phenomenon of deformation. In the case of the particle number symmetry, in which we are interested\nin this paper, the situation is far from being satisfactory because only a few\npairs of nucleons ( four to five) in the vicinity of the Fermi surface are thought\nto cause the phenomenon of nuclear superfluidity. Thus, it is well known that\nthe treatment of pairing correlations in the mean field approach produces an\nunrealistic transition from the superfluid to the normal phase along the yrast\nband, not expected in a finite system. In order to get an improved description\nof the nucleus it is clear that one has to go beyond the mean field approximation to include correlations. This task can be achieved in a simple and\neffective way within the particle number projection (PNP) [2] formalism, another possibility is to build correlations by the Random-Phase-Approximation\n(RPA) [3]. The latter is, however, from the applications point of view, very\nlimited, since the required calculation of the ground state correlations can be\nperformed only for very simple models and/or separable interactions. Concerning this point one has to keep in mind that not only the RPA but also\nother sophisticated theories have been developed only in simple models or\nwith separable forces. Thus the first calculation with exact particle number\nprojection before the variation was done about twenty years ago [4] with the\npairing plus quadrupole Hamiltonian and the Baranger-Kumar configuration\nspace.\nIn the last years in an attempt to achieve some progress in calculations with\neffective forces and large configuration spaces, the Lipkin Nogami method [5]\nhas experienced a revival. The great advantage of the Lipkin Nogami method is\nthat corrects, in an approximate way, for the zero point energy associated with\nthe breakdown of the particle number symmetry at the mean field level, i.e.\nthe calculations do not get much involved as compared to the full HFB ones.\nSome applications of this method with effective forces have been done with the\nSkyrme force [6,7], the Gogny force[8] and the relativistic mean field approach\n[9]. The Lipkin Nogami method on the other hand is just a recipe and cannot\nbe obtained from a variational principle. It is therefore desirable to develop an\nexact particle number projection which can be applied to effective forces. The\npurpose of this paper is to develop an exact particle number projection before\n(and after) the variation for density dependent forces and in particular for the\nGogny force. As we shall see, the exchange terms play an important role in\nPNP, in fact the neglection of any exchange term may lead to divergences.\nAs it is well known, in general, a zero range force is unable to provide good\npairing properties. As a matter of fact, normally the pairing terms of the force\nare neglected in order to get reasonable Hartree Fock results. To perform\n2\n\n\fHFB calculations a pairing force has been usually added ad hoc. The finite\nrange of the density dependent Gogny force, on the other hand, provides good\npairing properties without neglection of any exchange term. In fact, the force\nwas designed with this intention[10] and this property makes the Gogny force\none of the few effective density dependent forces for which particle number\nprojection is feasible without problem due to divergences. All the Skyrme\nparametrizations (with the few exceptions of those which provide reasonable\npairing correlations) and all relativistic mean field approaches may give in\ngeneral divergent contributions to the projected energy.\nIn section 2, we introduce the particle number projection method for nonseparable density dependent forces. In section 3 we present the formalism for\nthe density dependent part of the interaction and discuss some alternative\nprescriptions to this dependence. The gradient of the projected energy to\nbe implemented in the calculations is developed in section 4. In section 5,\nwe present results for the projection after variation (PAV) method for the\nnucleus 164 Er and discuss the problems associated with the divergent terms.\nResults for the variation after projection (VAP) method for the nuclei 48,50 Cr\nare discussed in section 6.\n\n2\n\nParticle Number Projected Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov Theory.\n\nThe Particle Number Projected Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov theory is the simplest symmetry conserving mean field approach which takes into account\nparticle-particle correlations. This theory has been derived in the past for\nnon-density dependent interactions and a detailed formulation has only been\ngiven for separable forces like the Pairing Plus Quadrupole model [4]. In order\nto generalize this theory to non-separable and density dependent forces, like\nthe Gogny or the Skyrme force, and to introduce the pertinent notation we\nshall also summarize the known formulation.\nLet |\u03a6i be a product wave function of the HFB type, i.e, the vacuum to the\nquasiparticle operators given by the Bogoliubov transformation\n\u03b1\u03bc =\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2020\nUk\u03bc\nck + Vk\u03bc\nck ,\n\n(1)\n\nk\n\nwhere (ck , c\u2020k ) are the particle annihilation and creation operators (usually in\nthe Harmonic Oscillator basis). This transformation does not conserve the\nparticle number symmetry and the wave function |\u03a6i is not an eigenstate of\nthe particle number operator N\u0302 . One can generate, however, out of |\u03a6i, an\n3\n\n\feigenstate, |\u03a8N i, of N\u0302 by the well known projection technique [1]\n2\u03c0\n\n1 Z\n|\u03a8N i = P\u0302 |\u03a6i =\nd\u03c6 ei\u03c6(N\u0302 \u2212N ) |\u03a6i,\n2\u03c0\nN\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nwhere the integration interval can be reduced to [0, \u03c0] whenever the intrinsic wave function has a well defined \"number parity\" [1] quantum number.\nFurthermore, the integral can be discretized in a sum using the Fomenko expansion [11]\nP\u0302LN =\n\nL\n1X\nei\u03c6l (N\u0302 \u2212N ) ,\nL l=1\n\n\u03c6l =\n\n\u03c0\nl,\nL\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L is the number of points used in the calculations, for L \u2192 \u221e one gets\nthe exact solution, usually L = 8 is used in the calculations. P N projects only\non one system of particles, in the general case, however, one has to perform\na double projection, for the number of neutrons and protons. In this case the\nprojected matrix element of any operator \u00d4, such that [\u00d4, N\u0302] = 0, is given by\n[4]\nOP =\n\nL X\nL\nX\nh\u03a6|\u00d4P\u0302 N\u03c0 P\u0302 N\u03bd |\u03a6i\n=\nyl\u03c0 yl\u03bd O(\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03bd ),\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 N\u03c0 P\u0302 N\u03bd \u03a6i\nl\u03c0 =1 l\u03bd =1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have introduced\nyl\u03c4 =\n\nh\u03a6\u03c4 |ei\u03c6l\u03c4 (N\u0302\u03c4 \u2212N\u03c4 ) |\u03a6\u03c4 i\nL\nX\n\ni\u03c6l\u03c4 (N\u0302\u03c4 \u2212N\u03c4 )\n\nh\u03a6\u03c4 |e\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n|\u03a6\u03c4 i\n\nl\u03c4 =1\n\nand the \u00d4-operator overlap\nO(\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03bd ) =\n\nh\u03a6|\u00d4ei\u03c6l\u03c0 N\u0302\u03c0 ei\u03c6l\u03bd N\u0302\u03bd |\u03a6i\n,\nh\u03a6|ei\u03c6l\u03c0 N\u0302\u03c0 ei\u03c6l\u03bd N\u0302\u03bd |\u03a6i\n\n(6)\n\nwith |\u03a6i = |\u03a6\u03c0 i|\u03a6\u03bd i. Another useful quantity is the norm overlap, which is\ngiven by\nxl\u03c4 = h\u03a6\u03c4 |ei\u03c6l\u03c4 (N\u0302\u03c4 \u2212N\u03c4 ) |\u03a6\u03c4 i,\nclearly, yl\u03c4 and xl\u03c4 are related by yl\u03c4 = y0\u03c4 xl\u03c4 , with y0\u03c4 = (\n4\n\n(7)\nPL\n\nl\u03c4 =1\n\nxl\u03c4 )\u22121 .\n\n\fAs it will be illustrated for the Hamiltonian operator, any operator overlap can\nbe calculated using the generalized Wick theorem [12]. This theorem allows to\nexpress matrix elements of the form h\u03a6|\u00d4|\u03a6\u0303i, exactly in the same way as the\nordinary Wick theorem, as the sum of all possible contracted products, where\n|\u03a6i and |\u03a6\u0303i are quasiparticle vacua.

This term, VDD , was introduced\nin the mean field approximation. In the MFA only diagonal matrix elements\nbetween product wave functions are needed to calculate the energy and, consequently, VDD is constructed to depend on the mean field density. In theories\nbeyond mean field, the density dependent part is given by\n\nP\nEDD\n=\n\n=\n\nh\u03a8N |V\u0302DD [\u03c1(~r)] |\u03a8N i\nh\u03a8N |\u03a8N i\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\u03c0 d\u03c6\u03bd h\u03a6|V\u0302DD [\u03c1(~r)] ei\u03c6\u03c0 N\u0302\u03c0 ei\u03c6\u03bd N\u0302\u03bd |\u03a6i\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(27)\n\nd\u03c6\u03c0 d\u03c6\u03bd h\u03a6|ei\u03c6\u03c0 N\u0302\u03c0 ei\u03c6\u03bd N\u0302\u03bd |\u03a6i\n\nwhere [\u03c1(~r)] indicates the explicit dependence of VDD on a density \u03c1(~r) to\nbe specified. Looking at these expressions it is not obvious which dependence\nshould be used. There are two more or less straightforward prescriptions [13]\nfor \u03c1(~r) :\n(1) The first prescription is inspired by the following consideration : In the\nMFA, the energy is given by h\u03a6|\u0124|\u03a6i/h\u03a6|\u03a6i and VDD is assumed to depend on the density h\u03a6|\u03c1\u0302|\u03a6i/h\u03a6|\u03a6i. On the other hand, if the wave function which describes the nuclear system is the projected wave function\n|\u03a8N i, we have to calculate the matrix element h\u03a8N |V\u0302DD |\u03a8N i/h\u03a8N |\u03a8N i\n(see the middle term in eq. (27)). It seems reasonable, therefore, to use in\n8\n\n\fVDD the density \u03c1(~r) = h\u03a8N |\u03c1\u0302|\u03a8N i/h\u03a8N |\u03a8N i = \u03c1P \u03c4 (~r), i.e. the projected\ndensity.\n(2) The other prescription has been guided by the choice usually done in the\nGenerator Coordinate method with density dependent forces [14]. The\nphilosophy behind this prescription is the following: to evaluate eq. (27)\nwe have to calculate matrix elements between different product wave\nfunctions |\u03a6i and |\u03a6\u0303i (|\u03a6\u0303i = ei\u03c6N\u0302 |\u03a6i) (see last term in eq. (27)). Then,\nto calculate matrix elements of the form\nh\u03a6|V\u0302DD |\u03a6\u0303i\nh\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i\n\n(28)\n\nwe choose the mixed density\n\u03c1(~r) = \u03c1\u03c6 (~r) =\n\nh\u03a6|\u03c1\u0302(~r)|\u03a6\u0303i\nh\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i\n\n(29)\n\nto be used in V\u0302DD . We shall call this approach the mixed density prescription.\nBoth prescriptions have been tested with the Gogny force in the Lipkin Nogami\napproach [15] and practically no difference was found in the numerical applications. One should notice that in the second prescription \u03c1(~r) depends on\nthe angle \u03c6 at variance with prescription 1.\nWe shall now proceed to evaluate the projected energy with both prescriptions.\n3.1 Prescription 1: Projected Density.\nUsing the projected density prescription, the projected energy of the density\u2013\nP\ndependent term (EDD\n) is obtained in a simple way. One just has to use in V\u0302DD\nthe projected density.

But\n2\nin order to evaluate expression (34) it is necessary to calculate (L /2 + 2)\ndifferent fields. For example, for L = 8, we have to calculate 34 fields.\n\n4\n\nRestoration of the particle number symmetry before the variation in HFB theories with non-separable forces.\n\nUsing equation (26), we can perform a restoration of the particle number symmetry, projecting after the variational Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov equations\nhave been solved. In this case the HFB wave function is not self\u2013consistently\ndetermined. In particular, if the HFB calculation collapses to the pairing uncorrelated HF one, the PNP method does not provide a better approximation.\nIn this section we shall derive the projected variational equations in order to\nsolve the self\u2013consistent problem, that means, the variation after the projection method.

As we have seen in eq. (8), the extended\nWick theorem allows to factorize matrix elements of the two-body part of the\ninteraction in terms of the generalized matrix density and pairing tensors. The\nmatrix element of eq. (8) takes a simple form in the canonical basis. Using\neqs. (9-11), we obtain\nh\n\n10\nh\u03a6| a\u2020k1 a\u2020k2 ak4 ak3 |\u03a6\u0303i = h\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i \u03c1k3 k1 \u03c1k4 k2 \u2212 \u03c1k4 k1 \u03c1k3 k2 + \u03ba01\nk1 k2 \u03bak3 k4\n\ni\n\nvk21 e2i\u03c6\nvk22 e2i\u03c6\n= h\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i 2\n*\n(\u03b4k k \u03b4k k \u2212 \u03b4k4 k1 \u03b4k3 k2 )\nuk1 + vk21 e2i\u03c6 u2k2 + vk22 e2i\u03c6 3 1 2 4\n#\nuk1 vk1\nuk3 vk3 e2i\u03c6\n+ 2\n*\n\u03b4 \u03b4  \u0304\nuk1 + vk21 e2i\u03c6 u2k3 + vk23 e2i\u03c6 k2 k\u03041 k4 k3\n\"\n\n(55)\n\nThe dangerous cases are for \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 and u2k = vk2 when the denominators\nQ\nbecome zero. Taking into account that h\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i = k>0(u2k + vk2 e2i\u03c6 ), it is easy to\nsee that as long as there is only one pole or two poles but k1 6= k2 ( or k3 6= k1 )\nthere are no problems because they will be cancel out by the multiplying\noverlap h\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i. The only case where problems arise is with the matrix elements\nof the form h\u03a6|a\u2020k a\u2020k\u0304 ak\u0304 ak |\u03a6\u0303i, because in this case no cancellation with the\nnorm overlap h\u03a6|\u03a6\u0303i is possible. It is easy to check, however, that in this case,\nthough each term of eq.(55) by itself is divergent, their sum gives a finite\nQ\n2 2i\u03c6\ne ), which behaves properly\ncontribution, namely vk2 * e2i\u03c6 * m>0,m6=k (u2m + vm\n2\nwhen vk = 1/2 and \u03c6 = \u03c0/2. That means, as long as all three terms of the Wick\nfactorization of eq. (8), i.e., the Hartree, the Fock and the Bogoliubov term,\nare taken into account no divergences appear in the PNP formalism. Notice\nthat the arguments given here are quite general and independent of the kind of\nforce (Coulomb force included) used in the calculations -see Appendix B for a\ndetailed discussion. This point has already been noticed in ref. [17]. Obviously,\none body operators will never cause problems to the PNP.\n15\n\n\fIn the case of the density dependent forces, one must be aware that this\ndependence itself may cause problems. As we have seen before, two different\nprescriptions have mainly been used to treat the density dependence of the\nHamiltonian. As discussed in Appendix B, the projected density prescription\ndoes not have divergences and the mixed density prescription has an integrable\ndivergence. For the moment, we use the projected density prescription (PAV1),\nat the end of this section we show results with the mixed density prescription\n(PAV2).\nUnfortunately most of the calculations performed so far with effective forces\nneglect exchange terms. Some of them because different forces are used in\nthe particle-hole and the particle-particle channel (like most of the Skyrme\nforce parametrizations and the relativistic mean field calculations). The contributions to the p-p interaction from the force used in the p-h channel being\nneglected and vice-versa. Others, though with the same force in both channels,\nlike the Gogny force, neglect some exchange terms (Coulomb among others)\njust to save CPU time. Only recently HFB calculations including all terms in\na triaxial basis has been performed with the Gogny force, see [18].\nObviously, the most interesting issue to address is to investigate how large the\ndivergences are in the case that some exchange terms are neglected. Though\nthis point will ultimately depend on the particular force used in the calculation, we shall illustrate it here for the Gogny force where we are able to\nperform the usual calculations which neglect some exchange terms and the\nexact ones. To be precise, we present two types of calculations, the first one\nis the usual one used in calculations with this force in a triaxial basis [19,20],\nnamely, the pairing field is calculated only from the Brink\u2013Boeker term, i.e.\nall additional pairing exchange terms are neglected and the Fock term of the\nCoulomb potential is either neglected or calculated in an approximate way.\nWe shall call this approximation HFBs , s for standard calculation -see ref. [18]\nfor further details. The wave function solution of the selfconsistent HFB equations with this approximate Hamiltonian will be denoted \u03a6s . In the second\ncalculation, the exact HFB equations (HFBe ) with the Gogny force are solved,\ni.e., all exchange terms are considered in the variational principle -see [18] for\nfurther details. The wave function resulting from the selfconsistent solution\nof the HFBe equations will be denoted \u03a6e . In a later stage the intrinsic wave\nfunctions obtained in these ways are projected onto good particle number in\norder to calculate the projected energy.\nIn the calculations, we have expanded the quasiparticle operators in a triaxial\nharmonic oscillator basis. The configuration space was chosen by the condition\nax nx + ay ny + az nz \u2264 N0\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the coefficients ai depend on the relations between the axes q = Rz /Rx\n16\n\n\fand p = Ry /Rx in the form ax = (qp)1/3 , ay = q 1/3 p\u22122/3 and az = p1/3 q \u22122/3 .\nThis basis has been symmetrized with respect to the simplex operation and is\n\u02c6\nan eigenstate of the operator \u03a02 T , with \u03a02 = P\u0302 e\u2212i\u03c0Jx , T is the time\u2013reversal\noperator, and P\u0302 the parity operator [21]. In the calculations we take N0 = 11.1.\nTo take into account the rotational motion we add to the Hamiltonian the\ncranking term \u2212\u03c9 J\u02c6x , as in ref. [20,18].\nThe most stringent test one can perform is to study the yrast band of a nucleus, 164 Er for example, since the pairing correlations and the quasiparticle\noccupancies vk strongly depend on the angular momentum. To separate the\ndifferent issues we shall first study only the convergence of the projected energy in terms of the parameter L of the Fomenko expansion. In order not to\nmix this issue with the divergence problem associated with the neglection of\nthe exchange terms, we shall solve first the exact problem, i.e. the HFBe case.\nTo illustrate more clearly our results we shall perform particle number projection after the variation (PAV), i.e., first the cranked HFBe equations with the\nGogny force are solved, as in ref. [18]. This provides us with the wave function\n\u03a6e . Then a projection on the particle number (PAVe ) is performed onto the\nwave function \u03a6e (for different L values ) to calculate the projected energy. In\nfig. 1, we display the results of the transition gamma ray energy in the PAVe\napproach for different L-values. We find that the points for the L-dependent\ncalculation are on top of each other, which indicates a clean convergence and\nthat L = 8 is already a good approximation to the exact PNP. This value is in\nagreement with earlier calculations [4,22]. We find, by the way, a good agreement with the experiment [23] up to I = 18h\u0304 and a considerable improvement\nto the HFBe approach (dashed line). For higher spin values, the agreement\nwith the experiment is not as good because the proton pairing energy has\nalready collapsed to zero.\nWe now turn to the problem of the divergences in calculations where the\nexchange terms are neglected. As we have seen in eq. (55) and in Appendix B,\nthe poles appear whenever u2k = vk2 = 1/2 and \u03c6l = \u03c0/2. The first condition,\nobviously, can not be eluded. In the non-selfconsistent PAV method because\nthe occupancies vk2 of the wave function are already determined by the solution\nof the HFB equations and in the self-consistent VAP because it would be\nagainst the variational principle. To investigate the behavior of the occupancies\nvk2 , we have solved the selfconsistent cranked HFBs equations along the Yrast\nband for the nucleus 164 Er. The wave functions \u03a6s determined in this way have\nbeen analyzed in the canonical basis. In Fig. 2, we show the smallest values\nof the quantity u2k \u2212 vk2 , for protons and neutrons, found in \u03a6s , as a function\nof the angular momentum. At small spins and up to spin 8 h\u0304, the quantity\nu2k \u2212 vk2 for neutrons is rather small (around \u22120.05), at spin 10 h\u0304 it reaches the\ncritical value u2k = vk2 and from this point on it steadily increases up to the\nmaximal value at a spin value of 28 h\u0304. This behavior is typical of the high spin\nregime. At small angular momentum, the system is well paired and we may\n17\n\n\f1.0\n0.8\n\nL=8\n\nL=32\n\nL=12\n\nEXP\n\nL=16\nE\u03b3 [MeV]\n\n0.6\n\nL=20\nL=24\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n164\n\n0\n\n4\n\nEr\n\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\u2013\nAngular Momentum ( h )\n\n28\n\nFig. 1.

As the spin\nincreases the pairs align (states start being predominantly occupied or empty)\nand at high spins, when the pairing collapse takes place, the states become\neither fully occupied or empty. For protons the situation is even worse, we find\ntwo critical points, one around I = 12h\u0304 and the other around I = 22h\u0304.\n1.0\n0.8\n\nHFBs\n164\n\n0.6\n\nEr\n\n(uk2 \u2212 vk2)min\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\nprot\n\nneut\n\n\u22120.8\n\u22121.0\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n\u2013\nAngular Momentum ( h\n)\n\n28\n\nFig. 2.

This recipe, as we shall see below, helps in some cases but it does not\nguarantees that one is error free. The reason is very easy, to find convergence\nin the Fomenko expansion one must take L large enough, but then one may get\ntoo close to the critical \u03c0/2. That means in this way one avoids to get nonsense\n18\n\n\fbut the results may not be reliable. As we have seen above and in Appendix B,\nin the neighborhood of the poles we will get separately big contributions to\nthe Hartree-Fock energy and to the pairing energy. If all exchange terms have\nbeen taken into account in the calculations, the sum of the divergent terms\nprovides a finite value. This cancellation, however, is not guaranteed if some\nexchange terms have been neglected, as in the HFBs approach, which we now\ndiscuss. In Table 1, we show for the nucleus 164 Er the differences in the pairing,\neq. (B.14), Hartree-Fock, eq. (B.12), and total, eq. (B.1), projected energies\ncalculated for L = 8 and L = 20 (column labeled L-EVEN) and for L = 9\nand L = 21 (column labeled L-ODD) as a function of the angular momentum.\nIn the even-L calculations in the PAVs approach, we find large \u2206E values\nin the pairing and the HF energies around I = 10, 12h\u0304 and I = 24h\u0304. These\ndeviations do not cancel each other and give rise to large \u2206Etot , indicating\nthat no convergence is reached. For odd-L values the situation is much better.\nThe largest \u2206Etot is around 20 keV which is more than one order of magnitude\nsmaller than in the even-L case. Lastly, in the last column the difference of the\ntotal energy between L = 8 and L = 9 is displayed. We clearly observe that\nagain large values around I = 10, 12h\u0304 and I = 24h\u0304 are obtained. Interestingly,\na comparison with fig. 2 shows that these spin values are those where u2k \u2212vk2 is\nvery small, i.e. the poles. The neutron system is responsible for the increase at\nI = 10h\u0304, see second column, and the proton one around I = 12h\u0304 and I = 24h\u0304.\n\u00bfFrom this table, we conclude that even-L values should be avoided and that\nthe total energy for odd-L is a function of L. Usually, we are not interested in\ntotal energies but in relative ones, for instance in the \u03b3-ray energy. Now the\nquestion is whether we can find a kind of plateau condition that provides us the\noptimal L-value for all I-values. In Fig. 3 we display the quantity E\u03b3L (I)/E\u03b311 (I)\nas a function of L. We have chosen the value L = 11 to normalize the \u03b3ray energies because it is large enough that in the absence of poles a good\nconvergence would be found, and small enough that in the presence of poles\nwe do not come too close to the critical \u03c6L = \u03c0/2. We found a good plateau\nfor spin values 2 to 6h\u0304 and a rather good one for I = 16, 18 and 20h\u0304, the worst\ncases are for I = 14h\u0304 and I = 24h\u0304. This behavior is again strongly correlated\nwith the nodes in Fig. 2. We observe that the largest deviations of the most\nreasonable values are about 7 %. It is clear that more sensitive quantities like\nsecond moments of inertia will show larger uncertainties.\nAll calculations of projected energies shown up to this point have been done\nwith the prescription of eq.

Notice that \u03a6e is different from \u03a6s and that the levels\noccupancies of both wave functions are not necessarily the same. As it is\nshown in section B.1.1 the prescription using the projected density, which\nwe shall label DD1, was divergence free, while the second prescription, the\nmixed density one (section B.1.2), from now on called DD2, was showing an\nintegrable divergence. As in Table 1 we shall calculate separately the pairing\nand the Hartree-Fock contributions to the total energy. Since the density\u2013\ndependent term does not contribute to the pairing energy (the parameter x0\nin the Gogny force is equal to 1) this energy is independent of the prescription\nused for the density dependent term. In Table 2 we display the differences\n\u2206E 8\u221220 of projected energies calculated with the pairing energy, eq. (B.14),\nthe HF energy, eq. (B.12) and the sum of both, the total energy.

To get convergence, either with the DD1\nor the DD2 prescription, the difference of the total energy calculated with\ndifferent L values, must be zero. This is the case in the DD1 approach where,\neven with even-L values, the HF energy differences are almost exactly the\nsame as the pairing ones. As a result, both cancel out and the total energy\nis convergent, as expected.

[DD1] and [DD2] are meaning\nthe prescription used for the density\u2013dependent term. In the last column \u2206Etot is\nthe difference between the projected energies calculated with L = 9 and L = 21.\n\nhowever, the HF results are different from the pairing ones and as a result no\nconvergence for the total energy is found. We know, however, that the DD2\ndivergence is integrable, that means if the integral is carefully performed the\nconvergence must be found. This is what happens if we do the calculations\nwith odd-L values (see last column) where the largest deviation found is 3\nkeV. Obviously, more sophisticated integration methods will provide better\nconvergence.\nAn interesting point concerning the density prescriptions DD1 and DD2 is to\nknow if there is a big difference in the results calculated with DD1 or DD2.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the \u03b3-ray energies along the yrast line of the nucleus 164 Er\nin the HFBe with the DD1 (in the figure PAV1) and with DD2 (in the figure\nPAV2). As we can see the behavior is very similar and the physics is clearly the\nsame.

[24] and [25] a good agreement between the HFB approximation, the\nexact shell model diagonalization and the experimental results was found for\nthe rotational states of the nuclei 48 Cr and 50 Cr. Only the \u03b3-ray energies\nalong the yrast bands in the HFB approach were systematically around 0.5\nMeV smaller than experimentally observed. A simulation with the exact shell\nmodel diagonalization in [24] showed that the shift was due to a deficient\ntreatment of the pairing correlations of the HFB method in the weak pairing\nregime. It is well known that the variation after projection method is able to\nprovide pairing correlations even at the limiting case when the HFB approach\ncollapses to the HF one.

[24] and [25] were performed in the standard\n23\n\n\f\u2013\nAngular Momentum (h\n)\n\napproximation, i.e. HFBs . For nuclei like these with little pairing -low level\ndensity at the Fermi surface- is very unlikely to find orbitals with vk2 = u2k ,\nnevertheless we have checked during the minimization process of the VAPs\nthat no orbitals were populated in that way. Additionally, we have performed\nalso the HFBe and the VAPe calculations. In Fig. 5, we represent the HFBs\nand VAPs (see eq.(B.14)) pairing energies for the nuclei 48 Cr, left hand side,\nand 50 Cr, right hand side. In the HFBs approach the pairing energies are rather\nsmall, for 48 Cr practically zero for all spin values, with the exception of the\nI = 0 and 2h\u0304 values where they are very small. For 50 Cr they are also very\nsmall and only for I = 0, 2, 4 and 12h\u0304 differ from zero. In both nuclei we find\nthe Coriolis antipairing effect that leads to a sharp transition from a (weakly)\nsuperfluid system to a normal one. The VAPs solutions, on the other hand,\nare well paired and no sharp transition is seen, only a smooth decrease in the\ncorrelation energy is found.\n16\n48\n\n50\n\nEXP\n\nEXP\n\nVAPs\n\nVAPs\n\nHFBs\n\nHFBs\n\nCr\n\nCr\n\n12\n8\n4\n0\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\nE\u03b3 [MeV]\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n3.0\nE\u03b3 [MeV]\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nFig. 6. The transition \u03b3-ray energies versus the angular momentum in the HFBs\nand VAPs approaches for the nucleus 48 Cr and 50 Cr. The experimental results are\nalso shown.\n\nIn Fig. 6, the \u03b3-ray energies along the yrast band are displayed in the HFBs\nand VAPs approaches together with the experimental results for 48 Cr, [26]\nand 50 Cr, [27]. As discussed in [24], the HFBs \u03b3-ray energies for 48 Cr show\nthe same trend as the experimental ones but are about 0.5 MeV smaller. The\nVAPs approach, on the other hand, due to the larger pairing energy leads to\nsmaller moment of inertia improving the agreement with the experiment. The\nVAPs results come closer to the experiment and the backbending is slightly\nbetter described. For 50 Cr the situation is similar, the VAPs approach improves\nconsiderably the HFBs one specially at low and medium spins. One may ask,\nhowever, why we do not get enough pairing correlations in the VAPs method\nas to match the experimental results. There are several possible answers, first\nin our calculations we do not include p-n pairing which is known [28] to play\nan important role in these nuclei. Second, the fact that in these nuclei, in the\nHFB approximation, there are barely any pairing correlations indicates that\nthe potential energy curve is rather flat against pairing fluctuations. This kind\nof fluctuations is not included in the PNP method.\n24\n\n\fIn Figs. 7 and 8, we finally present the results of the exact HFB calculations,\nHFBe , and the corresponding VAPe method. The pairing correlation energies\nare represented in Fig. 7. As expected [18], the neglected pairing terms in\nthe HFBs approach have an antipairing effect, mainly the Coulomb term.\nThe small pairing energy of the HFBs approach is quenched in the HFBe , in\nparticular the proton pairing energies completely vanish. The pairing energies\nin the VAPe approach display this effect even more clearly. The total VAPe\npairing energy is considerably reduced with respect to the VAPs approach.\nFurthermore, while in the VAPs the proton pairing energy is always larger\nthan the neutron one in the VAPe the proton pairing energy becomes always\nsmaller than the neutron one.\n5.0\n48\n\n50\n\nCr\n\nCr\n\n\u2212Epairing [MeV]\n\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n0\n\nVAPe\n\nprot\n\nneu\n\nHFBe\n\nprot\n\nneu\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8 10 12 14 16 18 0\n\u2013\nAngular Momentum (h\n)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8 10 12 14 16 18\n\u2013\nAngular Momentum (h\n)\n\nFig. 7.

Since the pairing energies are negligible\nin the HFBe and HFBs for both nuclei, both sets of \u03b3-ray energies practically\ncoincide. With respect to the VAPe values they are of the same quality as the\nVAPs though somewhat smaller than these one, as expected from the behavior\nof the pairing correlations.\n\n7\n\nConclusions.\n\nIn this paper we have derived the expressions needed to perform a particle\nnumber projected HFB calculation with a finite\u2013range and density dependent\nforce in the triaxial basis. We have studied and thoroughly discussed the divergences that appear for special values of orbital occupancies when exchange\nterms are neglected. We have performed exact and approximate calculations\n(neglecting some exchange terms) and found that in the latter case some problems associated with the convergence of the particle number projection arise\nleading in some cases to an inaccuracy of about 10 % in the values of the\n\u03b3-ray energies.

This feature presents a challenge for interactions\nwhere a given force is used in the particle-hole channel and a different one in\nthe particle-particle channel.\nWe have furthermore performed variation after the projection for the 48,50 Cr\nnuclei with the Gogny force. We found strong pairing correlations, at variance with the weekly correlated HFB approach. These correlations smoothly\ndecrease with increasing angular momentum indicating that no sharp phase\ntransition takes place as predicted by the HFB approach. The projected calculations improve the HFB ones but some correlations (probably T=0 pairing)\nnot present in our approach are still missing.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by DGICyT, Spain under Project PB970023.

To calculate h\u03a6|a\u2020k2 ak1 ei\u03c6l N\u0302 |\u03a6i,\nwe shall proceed in the same way. Let us first assume k2 6= k1 , then\nh\u03a6|a\u2020k2 ak1 ei\u03c6l N\u0302 |\u03a6i =\n\nY\n\nh\u2212|(uk + vk ak\u0304 ak )a\u2020k2 ak1 (uk + vk e2i\u03c6l a\u2020k a\u2020k\u0304 )|\u2212i = 0,(B.6)\n\nk>0\n\nthat means, the \u03c6l -dependent density matrix \u03c1k1 k2 (\u03c6l ), like the normal density\nmatrix \u03c1k1 k2 , is diagonal in the canonical basis. For k2 = k1 = k we obtain\nh\u03a6|a\u2020k ak ei\u03c6l N\u0302 |\u03a6i = vk2 * e2i\u03c6l *\n\nY\n\n2 2i\u03c6l\n(u2m + vm\ne ).\n\n(B.7)\n\nm>0,m6=k\n\nTherefore, in the canonical basis, the matrix \u03c1km (\u03c6l ) is given by\n\n\u03c1km (\u03c6l ) = \u03b4km *\n\nvk2 * e2i\u03c6l\n.\nu2k + vk2 e2i\u03c6l\n\n(B.8)\n\nWe see in this expression that for uk = vk and \u03c6l = \u03c0/2, the matrix element\ndiverges and one has to be very careful in the calculations. It is easy to show\nthat \u03c1k\u0304m\u0304 (\u03c6l ) = \u03c1km (\u03c6l ) .\nLet us now calculate the \u03c6l -dependent pairing tensors in the canonical basis\n28\n\n\fh\u03a6|a\u2020k2 a\u2020k1 eiN\u0302 \u03c6l |\u03a6i =\n\nY\n\nh\u2212|(um + vm am\u0304 am )a\u2020k2 a\u2020k1 (um + vm a\u2020m a\u2020m\u0304 e2i\u03c6l |\u2212i\n\nm>0\n\nY\n\n= \u03b4k1 k\u03042 uk2 vk2\n\n2\n(u2m + vm\n* e2i\u03c6l )\n\n(B.9)\n\nm>0,m6=k2\n\nin the same way\nh\u03a6|ak1 ak2 ei\u03c6l N\u0302 |\u03a6i = \u03b4k1 k\u03042 uk2 vk2\n\nY\n\n2\n(u2m + vm\n* e2i\u03c6l ).\n\n(B.10)\n\nm>0,m6=k2\n\nThe non-zero matrix elements are given by\n\n\u03ba01\nk k\u0304 =\n\nuk vk\n,\n2\nuk + vk2 e2i\u03c6l\n\n\u03ba10\nk k\u0304 =\n\nuk vk e2i\u03c6l\nu2k + vk2 e2i\u03c6l\n\n(B.11)\n\n10\n10\n01\nobviously, \u03ba01\nk k\u0304 = \u2212\u03bak\u0304k and \u03bak k\u0304 = \u2212\u03bak\u0304k .

We shall\ndistinguish between the two choices for the Hamiltonian density in order to\nstudy this problem.\n\nB.1.1 Projected density.\nTaking into account the expression (30), one sees that the density\u2013dependent\nenergy depends only on the proton and neutron projected densities. We must\n30\n\n\ftherefore analyze the behavior of these densities in the presence of poles. The\nprojected density is given by\n\u03c1Pk1 k2 =\n\nX\n\nyl \u03c1k1 k2 (\u03c6l ).\n\n(B.17)\n\nl\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, any pole of \u03c1k1 k2 (\u03c6l ) will be canceled by a\nzero of the same order from the factor yl . Therefore, if we take the projected\ndensity for the density dependent term, the total energy including this term\nis well\u2013defined.\n\nB.1.2 Mixed density.\nIn this case the energy of the density\u2013dependent term is given by eq. (34).\nAs we can see in this expression and in eq. (36), the densities \u03c1(\u03c6l\u03c4 ) and the\nnorms yl\u03c4 appear pairwise indicating a cancellation of possible poles and zeros.\nHowever, problems may arise if the interaction VDD itself has some poles. In\nthis prescription VDD depends on \u03c1(~r, \u03c6l ) given by eq. (33). Writing the density\nmatrix elements in the canonical basis we find that\n\u03c1(~r, \u03c6l ) =\n\nX\n\n(fkk (~r) + fk\u0304k\u0304 (~r))\n\nk\n\nvk2 e2i\u03c6l\nu2k + vk2 e2i\u03c6l\n\n(B.18)\n\nwhere the functions fkk\u2032 (~r) are defined in eq. (A.3). Clearly, if one of the vk2 ,\nlet's say vk20 , equals 1/2 then the density is singular at \u03c6l = \u03c0/2 and in the\nneighborhood of this point it behaves as\n\u03c1(~r, \u03c6l ) \u223c \u2212\n\n\u0011\ni\u0010\n1\nfk0 k0 (~r) + fk0 k0 (~r)\n2\n(\u03c6l \u2212 \u03c0/2)\n\n(B.19)\n\nwhich is clearly divergent. This singularity, however, does not pose any real\ndrawback as the density dependence of the interaction is proportional to\n\u03c1(~r, \u03c6l )\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1/3 and therefore the singularity is integrable.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
