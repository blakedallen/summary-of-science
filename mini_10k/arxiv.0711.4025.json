[1, 2]). Naturally the research devoted to detection concerns low amplitude GW:s. In an astrophysical context close to the GW source, the gravitational waves can propagate in a plasma\nmedium, and the amplitudes are larger. In Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] the authors have studied nonlinear responses to\nthe gravitational wave by the plasma medium, although the backreaction has been neglected. The nonlinear response\ngives raise to effects such as parametric instabilities [5, 6, 7, 8], large density fluctuations [3, 9], photon acceleration\n[3] and wave collapse [10]. The application of gravitational wave processes to astrophysics has been discussed by for\nexample Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], and to cosmology by Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19]. A number of works studying nonlinear\npropagation of gravitational waves including the backreaction from the plasma have also been written, see e.g. Refs.\n[7, 9, 20].\nIn Ref. [10] the coupled evolution of GW:s and (compressional) Alfv\u00e9n waves were considered, and a condition\nfor nonlinear wave collapse was derived. Here we develop that work, taking into account the dispersive properties of\nthe Alfv\u00e9n waves. For conditions, when wave collapse do not occur, we here show that the nonlinear evolution lead\nto significant wave steepening, and associated high harmonic generation. Furthermore, we find that the harmonic\ngeneration is saturated due to the dispersive effects associated with the Hall current. As a result, we are able to\nestimate the resulting wave spectrum. Due to the strong harmonic generation, it turns out that electromagnetic wave\nfrequencies several orders of magnitudes larger than the original GW frequency can be generated. Finally we discuss\nthe possibility that such radiation might be observable with satellite based radio arrays [21, 22].\n\nII.\n\nCOUPLED ALFV\u00c9N AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES\n\nThe metric of a linearized gravitational wave propagating in the z-direction can be written as [23]\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + [1 + h(z \u2212 ct)]dx2 + [1 \u2212 h(z \u2212 ct)]dy 2 + dz 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have assumed linear polarization, as will be justified below. For an observer comoving with the time\ncoordinate, the natural frame for measurements is given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne0 = \u2202t , e1 = 1 \u2212 12 h \u2202x , e2 = 1 + 12 h \u2202y , e3 = \u2202z .\n(2)\n\nWe now introduce the 3-vector notation such that \u2207 \u2261 (e1 , e2 , e3 ), E \u2261 (E 1 , E 2 , E 3 ) is the electric field and B \u2261\n(B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ) is the magnetic field. It can be shown [11] that in the frame (2) Maxwell's equations can be written\n\u03c1\n,\n\u03b50\n\u2207*B = 0 ,\nj\nj\n,\n\u2202t E \u2212 c2 \u2207\u00d7B = \u2212 E \u2212\n\u03b50\n\u03b50\nj\n\u2202t B + \u2207\u00d7E = \u2212 B .\nc\u03b50\n\u2207*E =\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\f2\nP\nHere \u03c1 \u2261 s q\u03b3n is the charge density, q and n denotes the charge and the proper particle density for a particle of\nspecies s and jE and jB are the effective gravitational current densities, defined by\n\u0001\nc\u03b50\nE 1 \u2212 cB 2 \u2202z h ,\n2\n\u0001\nc\u03b50\n1\nE 2 + cB 1 \u2202z h .\n= \u2212jB \u2261 \u2212\n2\n\njE1 = jB2 \u2261\n\n(7)\n\njE2\n\n(8)\n\nNext we assume the presence of a background magnetic field, B0 = B0 e1 , and introduce perturbations such that\nn = n0 + \u03b4n, B = (B0 + Bx )e1 , E = Ey e2 and v = vy e2 + vz e3 , corresponding to compressional Alfv\u00e9n waves\nexcited by the GW:s. We also note from Ref. [3] that in the case of gravitational waves propagating in a magnetized\nplasma, with the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of propagation, only the linear component of the GW\npolarization considered in Eq. (1) couples effectively to the electromagnetic wave. Furthermore vy \u226a c, (as vy /c \u223c h),\nand we therefore neglect terms of the type vy2 and vy h, but allow for vz \u223c c. We will also consider slow variations\nsuch that \u2202t \u226a \u03c9c \u2261 qB0 /m for each plasma species.\nFollowing Ref. [10], letting the variables depend on z and t, we find that the Maxwell and fluid equations can be\nreduced to\n\u2202t Ey \u2212 c2 \u2202z Bx +\n\nX q\n1\nc2\n\u03b3(n0 + \u03b4n)vy = \u2212 Ey \u2202t h + (B0 + Bx )\u2202z h ,\n\u03b50\n2\n2\ns\n\n1\n1\n\u2202t Bx \u2212 \u2202z Ey = \u2212 Ey \u2202z h + (B0 + Bx )\u2202t h ,\n2\n2\n\u2202t (\u03b3(n0 + \u03b4n)) = \u2212\u2202z (\u03b3(n0 + \u03b4n)vz ) ,\nq\n\u2202t (\u03b3vy ) + vz \u2202z (\u03b3vy ) =\n(Ey + vz (B0 + Bx )) ,\nm\nq\n\u2202t (\u03b3vz ) + vz \u2202z (\u03b3vz ) = \u2212 vy (B0 + Bx ) ,\nm\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere Eqs. (11)-(13) holds for each particle species. However, for notational convenience we omit the index denoting\nspecies, as we at this stage want to cover both the case of an electron-ion plasma as well as an electron-positron\nplasma. The above system of Eqs. (9)-(13) should be complemented by the non-trivial part of the linearized Einstein\nfield equations [3, 20, 24]\n\u0001\n(14)\nc\u22122 \u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202z2 h = \u03ba (\u03b4T11 \u2212 \u03b4T22 ) ,\nwhere \u03ba \u2261 8\u03c0G/c4 , G is Newton's gravitational constant and \u03b4Tij are the perturbed components of the energy\nmomentum tensor. Provided the coupled Alfv\u00e9n waves and GW:s move together close to the speed of light, the vacuum\nexpressions for the effective currents (7)-(8) holds approximately. The above system of equations has previously been\nstudied by Ref. [3] and Ref. [10]. In particular Ref. [10] derived a system of two coupled equations of the form\n1\n(\u2202t + U(Bx )\u2202z )Bx = B0 \u2202t h ,\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nB0 Bx\n1 2\n2\n\u2202 \u2212 \u2202z h = \u22122\u03ba\n,\nc2 t\n\u03bc0\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nP\n3/2\n2\nwhere U(Bx ) = c \u2212 (c3 /2CA\n) (B0 / (B0 + 2Bx )) , CA \u2261 c( s \u03c9p2 /\u03c9c2 )\u22121/2 is the non-relativistic Alfv\u00e9n velocity and\n\u03c9p = (n0 q 2 /\u01eb0 m)1/2 is the plasma frequency for each species. In contrast to Refs. [3, 10] we will here concentrate on\nthe evolution of the Alfv\u00e9n waves at a distance further from the gravitational source, where the Alfv\u00e9n-GW coupling\nis of less importance, and the GW source terms for the Alfv\u00e9n waves can be p\nneglected. Thus from now on we will\n2 /c2 is the (roughly constant)\nassume the perturbations to be of the form \u03c8 \u2248 \u03c8(z \u2212 VA t), where VA = CA / 1 + CA\nrelativistic Alfv\u00e9n velocity, which allows us to use \u2202t \u2248 \u2212VA \u2202z . With these approximations we can reduce the system\n(9)-(13) to\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX mn0\n\u2202z (\u03b3vz )\n2\n2 2\n(\u2202t \u2212 c \u2202z )Bx +\n= 0,\n(17)\nVA \u2202z\n\u03b50\nB0 + Bx\ns\nq\n(vz \u2212 VA )\u2202z (\u03b3vy ) \u2212 [vz (B0 + Bx ) \u2212 VA Bx ] = 0 ,\n(18)\nm\nq\n(19)\n(vz \u2212 VA )\u2202z (\u03b3vz ) + vy (B0 + Bx ) = 0 .\nm\n\n\f3\nSince \u03c9c\u22121 \u2202t \u226a 1 and \u03b3vy /c \u226a 1, Eq. (18) can be used to obtain an approximate expression of vz ,\nvz = VA\n\nBx\n,\nB0 + Bx\n\n(20)\n\nwhich in turn can be used together with (17) to express the wave equation as\n(\u2202t2 \u2212 c2 \u2202z2 )Bx +\n\nX mn0\ns\n\n\u03b50\n\nVA2 \u2202z\n\nB0 \u2202z Bx\n[B02\n\n+ 2B0 Bx + (1 \u2212 VA2 /c2 )Bx2 ]\n\n3/2\n\n=0.\n\n(21)\n\nBy using \u2202t2 \u2212 c2 \u2202z2 \u2248 \u2212(c + VA )(\u2202t + c\u2202z )\u2202z we obtain\n\u2202t Bx + V(Bx )\u2202z Bx = 0 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nV(Bx ) =\n\n(\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0015\u22123/2 )\nBx\nVA2 Bx2\nc \u2212 (c \u2212 VA ) 1 + 2\n+ 1\u2212 2\n.\nB0\nc\nB02\n\u0014\n\n(23)\n\nWe note here that the velocity V(Bx ) agrees with the velocity U(Bx ) in Eq. (15) (used previously by Ref. [10]) to\nfirst order in c/CA . Expression (22) is slightly more accurate, however, as c/CA \u226a 1 has not been used in the later\nderivation.\nR\u03c4\nMaking the transformation t = \u03c4 , z = \u03b6 + 0 V(B(\u03b6, \u03c4 \u2032 ))d\u03c4 \u2032 we have \u2202t \u2192 \u2202\u03c4 \u2212 (V(Bx )/R)\u2202\u03b6 and \u2202z \u2192 (1/R)\u2202\u03b6 ,\nR\u03c4\nwhere R \u2261 1 + 0 (\u2202V(Bx )/\u2202\u03b6)d\u03c4 \u2032 . As a consequence the general solution of Eq. (22) can be written Bx (z, t) = Bx (\u03b6),\nwhich formally shows that wave steepening continues until wave breaking occur, such that R \u2192 0 and \u2202z \u2192 \u221e at\nsome point for a finite time. Thus, in order to include dispersive effects that will prevent wave breaking we will need a\nmore accurate expression than Eq. (20) for vz . Dispersive effects are then included by keeping terms of a higher order\nin an \u03c9c\u22121 \u2202t -expansion. How to implement this is to some extent dependent on whether we study an electron-ion\nplasma (in which case it is the higher order expression for the ion polarization drift that first leads to wave dispersion),\nor whether we consider an electron-positron plasma (in which case electron and positron motion contributes to wave\ndispersion simultaneously). For the astrophysical applications to be considered below, an electron-ion plasma is more\nappropriate, and thus we will focus on this case in the remainder of the article, using index i to denote ion quantities\nbelow. The only consequence for the calculations that\nP has been made above is that we can simplify the expression\nfor the Alfv\u00e9n velocity slightly, such that CA = c( s \u03c9p2 /\u03c9c2 )\u22121/2 = (B02 /\u03bc0 mi n0 )1/2 . Next, using Eq. (20) as an\napproximation of vzi in Eq.

(26) now describes the fully nonlinear evolution combined with dispersive effects.

(28). Our main interest here is the steepening of an initially sinusoidal wave profile. A study of the KdV\nequation for such initial conditions shows that the wave steepening induced by the nonlinearity leads to a harmonic\ncontent. However, as we are interested in generation of large harmonic content, with wave steepening occurring on a\ncomparatively fast time scale, we need to study the fully nonlinear dispersive Eq. (26) rather than Eq. (28).\nAn initially sinusoidal wave described by Eq. (26) can at first be approximated with Eq. (22) if the initial wave\nfrequency \u03c9 fulfills \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9ci . As a consequence the sinusoidal profile will undergo wave steepening until dispersive\neffects becomes important leading to a saturation of the steepening and the approach to a steady state profile, as can\nbe described by Eq. (26). Thus we are looking for solutions to Eq. (26) that are periodic and static in a frame moving\nwith the wave. The general methods for finding solutions of this type is described in some detail in Ref. [26]. First\nwe let \u2202t \u2192 \u2212VAn \u2202z , where VAn is a constant representing the nonlinearly modified Alfv\u00e9n velocity. Integrating the\nresulting equation with respect to z, we get an equation that are analogous to a particle moving in a potential [26].\nFor appropriate choices of integration constants, the motion corresponds to a particle moving in a potential well, in\nwhich case we obtain solutions of the desired type, i.e. Bx = Bx (z \u2212 VAn t), where Bx is a periodic function of the\nargument. The resulting differential equation for Bx has to be solved numerically. The degree of wave steepening\nin the resulting wave profile depends on the amplitude of the oscillations as well as on \u03c9/\u03c9ci , parameters which are\nrelated to the integration constants. For given integration constants, the corresponding physical parameters can be\ncalculated straightforwardly, and thereby solutions with parameters of physical interest can be found by some trial\nand error. Solutions of astrophysical relevance showing significant wave steepening corresponding to large harmonic\ncontent of the wave profile will be presented in the preceding section.\nIII.\n\nASTROPHYSICAL EXAMPLE\n\nIn this section we are going to investigate the nonlinearly modified Alfv\u00e9n waves, and to what extent these can\nbe observed. Based on the fact that electromagnetic signals are easier to detect than gravitational ones of the same\npower, we will be looking for a spectral signature of GW-generated Alfv\u00e9n waves. As is wellknown, the gravitational\nsources have high powers only up to frequencies of the order \u223c 1kHz, which is much below the lowest observable\nradio frequencies [21, 22]. Thus for GW induced radio wave detection to be possible, we will need a mechanism to\nconvert some fraction of the electromagnetic energy to higher frequencies. As we will demonstrate below, the processes\nstudied in Section II can provide the basis for such mechanisms, and thus lead to a large increase of the frequency for\na significant fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nBelow we will study a concrete example. As a source of gravitational radiation we consider a binary system. At\nleast one of the objects should have a strong magnetic field (in order to make the Alfv\u00e9n phase velocity close to c), and\nthe objects should be compact (as to make the gravitational wave frequency and amplitude before merging reasonably\nlarge). For definiteness we study a system consisting of two neutron stars of equal mass M\u2299 , separated by a distance\nof 20 RS , where RS = 2GM\u2299 /c2 \u2248 3 km. Furthermore, the surface magnetic field of each neutron star is assumed to\nbe 4 \u00d7 106 T. The surroundings of the binary system can loosely be divided into three regions (Fig. 1), depending on\nwhich physical mechanisms that is dominating.\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nFIG. 1: The neighborhood of the binary system is divided into three regions: region I (10RS \u2212 30RS ), the energy conversion\nzone; region II (30RS \u2212 3500RS ), the nonlinearity enhancement zone and region III (3500RS \u2212 7000RS ), the wave steepening\nzone.\n\n\f5\nA.\n\nEnergy conversion zone\n\nThe interval 10 RS \u2212 30 RS from the center of mass (CM) roughly constitutes region I, which is the region where\nmost of the gravitational energy is gained by the Alfv\u00e9n-wave. Using a Newtonian approximation, with d = \u03b1RS and\nr = \u03b2RS , it is straightforward to show that |h| \u223c (2\u03b1\u03b2)\u22121 , where d is the separation distance between the binary\nobjects and r is the observation distance from the center of mass of the system. In order to obtain an estimate of\nthe amplitude of the generated EM-wave, we note that in the near zone (i.e. where the magnetic pulsar magnetic\nfield decays as a dipole) the plasma density is low, and we expect that for our purposes here, we can approximate the\nmedium as vacuum. A calculation of the electromagnetic amplitude generated by the GW during such circumstances\nhas been done by Ref. [3]. Combining the above expression for the gravitational wave amplitude at given distances\nwith Eq. (14) of Ref. [3], the GW-induced magnetic field amplitude \u03b4B can thus be estimated. The result is\n\u03b4B\n\u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\nB0\n\n(29)\n\nat the of end region I.\nB.\n\nNonlinearity enhancement zone\n\nIn region II (approximate interval 30 RS \u2212 3500 RS from the CM) the ratio determining the degree of nonlinearity,\n\u03b4B/B0 , is increasing quadratically . The reason is that \u03b4B suffers spherical attenuation (due to the high frequency)\nwhereas B0 decays as a dipole field until the light cylinder is reached. The outer bound of region II, with a light\ncylinder at 3500RS , is somewhat artificially chosen, and correspond to a pulsar period of 35 ms. Note, however, that\nthe nonlinearity enhancement mechanism is sufficient to reach the strongly nonlinear regime (i.e. \u03b4B/B0 \u223c 1) within\nregion II even for faster pulsars.\nC.\n\nWave steepening zone\n\nIn region III (approximate interval 3500 RS \u2212 7000 RS ), the amplitude of the Alfv\u00e9n waves is strongly nonlinear,\nand thus pronounced wave steepening will occur here, as described by Eq. (28). The characteristic propagation length\nLp for large steepening to occur is of the order\nLp \u223c\n\n\u03bb VA\n,\n2 \u03b4VA\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03b4VA is the velocity difference between the maximum and minimum wave velocity within the amplitude wave\nprofile with dispersive effects neglected. At the beginning of region III we have B0 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 T. Assuming a\nmoderate plasma density, of the order n0 \u2243 1010 m\u22123 , gives an Alfv\u00e9n velocity VA \u2243 0.9c. Furthermore, a relatively\nstrong nonlinearity with \u03b4B/B0 = 0.25, consistent with the estimate made in section III B, correspond to \u03b4VA \u2243 0.2c,\nwhich combined with a wavelength \u03bb \u2243 1.7 \u00d7 106 m result in a steepening distance located reasonably well within\nregion III.\nDue to the nonlinear velocity dependence of the amplitude, wave steepening continues until the dispersive effects\nbecome important. As the initial GW-generated angular frequency is \u03c9 \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 103 s\u22121 , whereas \u03c9ci \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 105 s\u22121\nin our case, and the amplitude is strongly nonlinear, the steady state profiles are dramatically changed as compared\nto the initially sinusoidal wave profiles. The steady state profile derived numerically from Eq. (28) corresponding\nto \u03c9/\u03c9ci = 1/240 and \u03b4B/B0 \u2248 0.25 is shown in Fig. 2. Since, the temporal and spatial derivatives are orders of\nmagnitudes larger than the corresponding values for the initial profile, the spectral content has changed dramatically\nfrom the initially quasi-monochromatic wave. The spectrum corresponding to the same data as in Fig. 2 is shown\nin Fig. 3. There it is seen that the highest harmonic generation of Alfv\u00e9n waves may approach the 100 kHz range.\nUnfortunately, this is still not enough to reach the radio window for earth based antennas, where the lower cut-off lies\naround 20MHz. However, proposals such as the Astronomical Low Frequency Array (ALFA) [21] and more recently\nthe Solar Imaging Radio Array (SIRA) [22] show that satellite based antennas can provide an opening for observation,\nsince such arrays are planned for a sensitivity down to frequencies of the order 30kHz. As shown in Fig. 3, the spectral\ncontent exceeding this frequency is of the order 10% of the total wave energy density. Thus the astrophysical processes\noutlined here in section III opens for the possibility to correlate and interpret GW-observations made by LIGO or\nLISA with radio wave observations made with SIRA.\n\n\f6\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\nBx/B0\n\n0.05\n0\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.25\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\nzn\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nFIG. 2: The wave profile for a moderately nonlinear amplitude (\u03b4B/B0 \u2248 0.25) as a function of the normalized distance\nzn = z \u03c9ci /VA .

The dependence of the\nAlfv\u00e9n velocity on the magnetic field amplitude makes the evolution equation for the Alfv\u00e9n waves strongly nonlinear.\nAs described in section II, GW-generated Alfv\u00e9n waves are subject to nonlinear wave steepening, which is directly\nassociated with harmonic generation. In order to find a saturation mechanism for the steepening process, we have\nincluded dispersive effects in our model by solving the momentum equation to third order in an \u2202t /\u03c9c -expansion. As\ndemonstrated in section IIIc, the high amplitude steady state solutions for the Alfv\u00e9n waves show strong harmonic\ngeneration, which for sufficient amplitude does not saturate until the frequencies of the harmonics approach the\ncyclotron frequency of the ions.\nAs a specific example we have considered a case where the GW:s associated with a neutron star-pulsar merging\ngenerate strongly nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n waves, resulting in high harmonic generation of the Alfv\u00e9n waves. As shown, the\noriginal GW-frequencies of the order \u223c 200Hz may generate signals with harmonic number n \u223c 200 or even larger.\nUnfortunately this is not sufficient to reach the radio window for earth based detection, but proposals for satellite based\nradio observations [22], that can detect radio signals down to \u223c 30kHz could make observations possible. This opens for\nthe future possibility to correlate GW-observations made by for example LISA [1] with radio wave observations made\nwith SIRA [22], to make detailed comparison with theories for the coupled electromagnetic-gravitational evolution.\nThe process described here can be even more effective than in our example, if pulsars with stronger magnetic fields\nare considered.\nFinally we should point out that for the Alfv\u00e9n waves generated in our example to travel through interstellar\ndistances, they must be more or less decoupled from the medium to become ordinary radio waves. For this to happen,\nthe density should fall off with distance sufficiently fast after the wave steepening region in the previous example, such\nthat the plasma frequency falls beyond the highest parts of the wave frequency before the cyclotron frequency does\n\n\f7\nso. In our example this is fulfilled, since the highest harmonic frequencies can exceed the plasma frequency already\nwithin the wave steepening region. However, for an accretion disc that is still thick at a distance when the magnetic\nfield falls below the wave frequency, cyclotron damping could limit the possibilities for Radio wave detection to a\nsignificant extent.\nV.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n\nREFERENCES\n\nM.
