P. Beardsley, et al.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAntenna placement is a critical design criterion for any interferometric array as it determines the baseline distribution and thus the angular dynamic range of the point spread\nfunction of the observatory. Nearly all observatory sites have\nareas where antennas cannot be placed. Buildings, roads,\nrunways, power and data access, land use and ownership\nissues, endangered flora and fauna, flood zones, elevation,\nand ground stability are but a few of the common issues\nthat constrain the placement of antennas. Even in remote\ndesert locations a flat and barren terrain can quickly become dotted with exclusion zones where antennas cannot be\nplaced.\nThis is of particular concern for 21 cm Cosmology\ntelescopes targeting the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dark energy measurements, as the quality of the monochromatic PSF is directly\nrelated to the ability to subtract foreground contamination (Morales et al. 2006; Datta et al. 2011; Liu & Tegmark\n2011; Bernardi et al. 2011, Vedantham, Shankar, Subrahmanyan in review). Antenna exclusion zones can introduce\nasymmetries in the baseline distribution which limit the angular dynamic range and thus achievable level of foreground\nsubtraction (see Morales & Wyithe 2010, for a recent review\nof foreground subtraction for 21 cm Cosmology).\nThere is a long history of array configuration studies,\nincluding optimization of arrays with cost constraints (e.g.\nCohanim et al. 2010), simulated annealing for small N arrays (Cornwell 1988), optimization to reduce the peak sidelobe levels (Kogan 2000, Kogan & Cohen 2005, LWA Memo\n21), or optimization to match a particular baseline distribution with and without ground constraints (Boone 2001, Lal\net al. SKA Memo 107). Our particular concern is situations\nin which some areas cannot be used (exclusion zones), a particular radial baseline distribution must be met, and a very\nhigh angular dynamic range must be achieved. While our\nproblem is similar to that of Boone (2001), we find that the\nfigure of merit used in that work does not sufficiently capture large scale structure in the baseline distribution. We\ndevelop an alternative figure of merit, which naturally leads\nto a new optimization method.\nIn \u00a72 we explore the effect of exclusion zones on the\nbaseline distribution, develop a new spatially sensitive figure of merit, and present our new optimization method. We\nthen apply our method to placing the MWA tiles in \u00a73, and\npresent the final MWA antenna configuration. The locations\nof all 512 tiles are provided in the electronic supplement.\n\n2\n\nARRAY LAYOUT COMPARISONS AND A\nNEW TECHNIQUE\n\nProposed and future large N radio arrays will face the challenge of placing hundreds to thousands of antennas to optimize scientific goals, while obeying numerous constraints.\nWhile most physical constraints exist on the antenna locations (areas of exclusion on the ground), science capabilities\n\nare optimized in the uv plane for an interferometric measurement, and hence these arrays should match the ideal\nbaseline distribution as closely as possible. This makes the\nproblem very non-linear because any one antenna placement\naffects N \u2212 1 baselines, and it is not immediately obvious\nhow a constraint such as an exclusion area will affect the\nbaseline distribution.\nIn our analysis, we explored three array layout methods.\nThe first method is random and with no exclusion areas\n(\"random unmasked\"), in which antennas are placed randomly with a weighted radial distribution. Algorithmically,\nfor each antenna a radius is first drawn from a distribution that matches the desired radial density profile, then\nazimuthal angles are chosen at random until one is found\nthat does not overlap with previously placed antennas. The\nsecond array generation method is also random but incorporates exclusion areas (\"random masked\"). This method is\nidentical to the random unmasked method, with the addition of avoiding exclusion areas by the use of a mask that\nis checked in the same step as checking for overlap with\nprevious tiles. The third and final method is the algorithm\nthat we developed (\"active method\"), that actively minimizes spatial structure in the baseline distribution and is\ndetailed later in this section. Our analysis assumes the scientifically desired uv or antenna distribution is known. We\nuse the specifications for the MWA telescope (which are described in \u00a73), but our methods are generalizable to any\nlarge N array.\nFigure 1 shows three examples of baseline distributions\ngenerated by the random unmasked, random masked, and\nactive masked methods respectively. The left pane shows the\nbaseline distribution on a logarithmic scale, while the right\npane shows the difference from the ideal smooth analytic\nfunction to accentuate undesired structures in the uv distributions. These three examples are representative of the over\nfour thousand array layouts we have hand graded to arrive\nat our conclusions.\nAll of these images have fuzzy small scale noise due\nto the finite number of antennas. However, there is another\nmore insidious artifact present in the masked baseline distribution (middle row of Figure 1)-large scale structure imprinted by the antenna exclusion areas. In all of the masked\nrandom array realizations there are significant regions of\nover and under densities in the baseline distribution which\ntranslate directly into unwanted PSF features.\nTo understand the effect of baseline over and under densities, consider a nearly perfect uv distribution with a small\nregion of excess baselines. This region of uv over density can\nbe viewed as a 'wave packet' of baselines at similar spatial\nfrequencies. In the wave packet picture there is a fundamental corrugation in the PSF given by the location of the\ncenter of the excess region. However, the nearby modes in\nthe packet beat in and out of phase with the fundamental\ncorrugation. When the wave numbers are all in phase the\namplitude is very high-the number of excess baselines in\nthe region-but they quickly dephase only to rephase again\nsome distance further along in the PSF. The undesirable\n'features' seen in most PSFs are the periodic signature of a\nwavepacket beating across the PSF. Over (or under) dense\nregions that cover a large portion of the uv plane will quickly\ndamp down (wide bandwidth), though they often have a\nlot of power due to the large number of baselines involved,\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\fA new optimization technique for interferometric arrays and the final MWA antenna layout\nuv Distribution\n\n3\n\nuv Difference from Ideal\n\nRandom Unmasked\n\n\u03c72 =6.9352 km2, \u03b6 =20.4534 m\u22122\n\n1000\n500\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\u22121500\nRandom Masked\n\n\u03c72 =6.1667 km2, \u03b6 =25.9258 m\u22122\n\nNorth\u2212South (m)\n\n1000\n500\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\u22121500\nActive Masked\n\n\u03c72 =8.5504 km2, \u03b6 =12.1827 m\u22122\n\n1000\n500\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\u22121500\n\n\u22121000 \u2212500\n0\n500 1000 1500\nEast\u2212West (m)\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\u22122\n\nBaselines (10 m)\n\n1000\n\n\u22121000 \u2212500\n0\n500 1000 1500\nEast\u2212West (m)\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\nBaselines (10 m)\n\nFigure 1.

The left panes show the snapshot single frequency baseline distributions on a log scale, while the right panes show\nthe difference of this distribution from the smooth analytic ideal. The small scale fuzzy noise is equally present in all array realizations\nand is due to the finite number of antennas. However, the large scale structure varies greatly from array to array. The exclusion areas\nhave introduced significant asymmetries in the baseline distribution of the random masked method (middle row). The active masked\nmethod (bottom row) is able to highly suppress this structure, even beyond the level of the unconstrained random method (top row).\nFurthermore, we see the figure of merit, \u03b6, accurately reflects the amount of azimuthal structure in the distributions (see Figure 2).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\f4\n\nA.

While the \u03c72 values do not distinguish the quality of the different\nrealizations (a conclusion firmly supported by our hand grading), the \u03b6 values strongly separate the realizations based on asymmetry.\n\nand correspond to large close-in sidelobes. Smaller features\nin the uv plane damp more slowly and repeat many times\nacross the PSF leading to the small far sidelobes. A smooth\nuv distribution necessarily leads to a smooth PSF, and the\nPSF slidelobe structure is dominated not by the unavoidable\nfuzzy noise but instead the larger regions of over and under\ndensity in the uv plane.\nOur first approach to quantify the deviations from the\ndesired uv distributions was to consider \u03c72 . This was calculated by gridding the uv distribution and integrating the\nsquare of the difference from the ideal, weighted by the variance in each pixel from 500 random unmasked realizations.\nHowever, \u03c72 is not a spatially aware function-any deviation from the ideal is weighted the same regardless of where\nin the uv plane the deviation occurs. Because of this lack\nof spatial information, \u03c72 does not capture the large scale\nstructure that is important to choosing an array. The examples in Figure 1 vary quite a bit in quality, however, the\nassociated \u03c72 values do not reliably reflect the degree of\nspatial structure. The insensitivity of \u03c72 to array quality\nis demonstrated again in the histogram in Figure 2(a). Despite a clear qualitative difference between the masked and\nunmasked random configurations (dashed blue and dash-dot\nred) the distributions of \u03c72 are very similar.\nWith the spatial dependence in mind, our next step was\nto develop a figure of merit based on a Bessel decomposition.\nThe residual uv distribution (D(r, \u03c6), difference between actual and desired) can be decomposed into Bessel modes\n\nD(r, \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e\n\u221e X\nX\n\nn=1 m=0\n\nJm\n\n\u0010x\n\nmn r\n\nR\n\n\u0011\n\n(Amn sin(m\u03c6)+Bmn cos(m\u03c6)),\n\n(1)\nwhere xmn is the nth zero of the mth Bessel function. The amplitudes of the asymmetric Bessel coefficients\n(Amn , Bmn , m > 0) reflect the asymmetric spatial over and\nunder densities in the uv plane. We then define a figure of\n\nmerit \u03b6 as the sum of these Bessel coefficients\nmax m,n\n\n\u03b6\u2261\n\nX\n\nm>0,n\n\np\n\n2 .\nA2mn + Bmn\n\n(2)\n\nSmaller \u03b6 corresponds to less spatial structure, and hence\na more desirable layout. The right hand panel of Figure 2\nshows the \u03b6 distributions for the same arrays, clearly separating the masked and unmasked random arrays, and in\nFigure 1 the \u03b6 values accurately track the quality of the\narray realizations.\nTo minimize our figure of merit, we created an active\nmasked algorithm based on the \u03b6 figure of merit. For computational reasons we first place a subset of the antennas (350\nof 496 for our example) using the random masked method.\nThen for each remaining antenna, we first choose a weighted\nrandom radius, r, and many candidate azimuthal locations\n(angular spacing of 10 m in our example). We then select\nthe location with the smallest \u03b6 value, and repeat until all\nN antennas are placed.\nThe result is clear in Figures 1 & 2. Despite having\nthe additional constraint of the exclusion areas, the active\nmasked method produces more symmetric baseline distributions than either the random masked (expected) or random\nunmasked methods (unexpected). We can see this qualitatively by comparing the baseline distributions in the three\nexamples. In the thousands of arrays we examined by hand\nwe observed a very strong correlation between small \u03b6 and\nspatial symmetry . The success of our algorithm is shown\nstatistically by the distribution of \u03b6 values for the three\nmethods in Figure 2(b).\nIt is of interest to note that significant baseline asymmetry arises even in the unmasked random array realizations\n(Figure 1 top row, no exclusion areas). These asymmetries\nare due to shot noise in the random antenna placement. Conceptually, as the last few antennas are added images of the\nentire array are added to the uv plane at that distance from\nthe center. For centrally condensed arrays this can produce\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n\fA new optimization technique for interferometric arrays and the final MWA antenna layout\n\nNorth\u2212South (m)\n\n1000\n500\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\u22121500\n\n\u22121000\n\n0\n1000\nEast\u2212West (m)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nBaselines (10 m)\u22122\nFigure 3.

Alternatively, one can consider moving a single antenna on the ground which coherently changes\nN \u2212 1 baselines. Small random associations can thus make\nsignificant correlations in the baseline distribution.\nThe new active method based on the Bessel decomposition figure of merit produces arrays which are superior to\neven an unconstrained random algorithm, even in the face\nof significant exclusion areas.\n\n3\n\nMWA FINAL LAYOUT\n\nWe have used our new algorithm to determine the final array layout of the MWA. The full build out of the MWA will\nconsist of 512 \"tiles\" (each comprised of 16 radio dipoles).\nThe majority of the tiles (496) will be distributed over a\n1.5 km diameter core, with the remaining 16 tiles at a \u223c3\nkm diameter to provide higher angular resolution for solar\nmeasurements. The 16 \"outliers\" are placed by hand, while\nwe implement our algorithm for the 496 core tiles. The tile\ndensity distribution will be constant within a central 50m radius, and have a r \u22122 dependence beyond (see Lonsdale et al.\n2009, for a full description of the MWA instrument). The\nsmooth ideal distribution is shown in Figure 3.\nSeveral parameters of the algorithm were explored to\nfurther improve the quality of the arrays being generated.\nFor example, we varied the number of random tiles placed\nbefore initializing the active phase of our algorithm. We\nfound that placing 350 random tiles provided sufficiently\nunconstrained initial conditions to proceed with the active\nphase. Running the algorithm in this mode 500 times provided a good sampling of the phase space.\nWe also investigated several array center locations\nwithin a few hundred meters of the nominal array location.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20138\n\n5\n\nDue to the irregular distribution of avoidance areas on the\nground, choosing different centers did have an effect on the\nquality of the best arrays generated by our algorithm. In\nparticular, a center near a high concentration of vegetation\nor rock outcrops usually results in a deficit of short baselines. We used this information, along with feedback from a\nground truth survey in February 2011 to determine our final\narray center.\nAfter generating 500 candidate arrays for each potential\nlocation, we used \u03b6 as a guideline for selecting the highest\nquality array layouts, backed by hand grading. The result is\nthe final location and layout of the MWA. Figure 6 shows an\nillustration the final array overlaid on an aerial photo of the\nsite. The locations of 496 core tiles, along with the 16 hand\nplaced outliers, are available in the electronic supplement to\nthis paper. Figures 4 & 5 show the corresponding uv distribution and PSF. There is essentially no asymmetry in the\nfinal array-all of the large scale structure is greatly suppressed, providing a very smooth uv sampling. The small\nresidual ripples in the PSF are on the order of the background noise we expect due to the finite number of tiles.\nFollowing the discussion of Morales (2005) and using the\nparameters from Bowman et al. (2006), the thermal noise\nuncertainty on the EoR power spectrum can be calculated\nin the bottom panel of Figure 4. With the exception of the\nsmall deviation at very low k, the thermal noise for our proposed layout very nearly traces that of the ideal array.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWhile we have been motivated by the need to generate a final\narray configuration for the MWA with exquisite smoothness\nin the PSF despite significant exclusion areas, we hope our\nmethod will be useful for determining the antenna layouts\nof other large N arrays. In particular we have developed a\nnew figure of merit based on Bessel decomposition that is\nsensitive to large scale over and under densities in the uv\nplane. We have shown that algorithms based on this figure\nof merit can achieve extremely smooth baseline distributions\nwhile avoiding areas where antennas cannot be placed.\nWe have used this new algorithm to choose the final\nantenna locations of the MWA. The first construction stage\nof the MWA will consist of \u223c128 antenna subsample of the\narray configuration shown in this paper.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the Wajarri Yamatji people as the traditional owners of the Observatory site.
