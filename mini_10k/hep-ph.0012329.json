The \u03c0-meson (or \u03c0-nonet) is now widely believed to have a dual nature\nof non-relativistic system and also of relativistic system as a Nambu-Goldston (NG)\nboson in the case of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. However, no successful\nattempts to unify the above two view points have been yet proposed.\nOn the other hand we have developed the covariant oscillator quark model\n(COQM) 1), 2), 3) for many years as a covariant extension of NRQM, which is based\non the boosted LS-coupling scheme. The meson wave functions (WF) in COQM are\nN\nthe restricted tensors in the \u0168 (4) O(3, 1) space which reduce at the rest frame to\nN\nthose in the SU (2)spin O(3)orbit space in NRQM. Although the COQM had been\nsuccessfully applied to various non-static as well as static problems of hadrons with\ngeneral quark configuration, no consideration on chiral symmetry was given there.\nThe purpose of this paper is to get rid of this defect in COQM and is to give\na unified view point of the two contrasting ones of the composite meson systems,\nN\nextending the WF to the general tensors in the \u0168 (4) O(3, 1) space, which are\nrequired for taking into account chiral symmetry.\n\u00a72.\n\nCovariant Framework for Describing Composite Mesons\n\nFor meson WF described by \u03a6A B (x1 , x2 ) (x1 , x2 denoting the space-time coordinate and A = (\u03b1, a)(B = (\u03b2, b)) denoting the Dirac spinor and flavor indices of\n\n\f146\nconstituent quark (anti-quark)) we set up the bilocal Yukawa equation 3)\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u2212 M2 (x\u03bc ,\n) \u03a6A B (X, x) = 0\n2\n\u2202X\u03bc\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n(2.1)\n\n(X(x) denoting the center of mass (CM) (relative) coordinate of meson), where the\nM2 is squared mass operator including only a central, Dirac-spinor-independent\nconfining potential. The WF is separated into the plane wave describing CM motion\nand the (Fierz-component) internal WF as\n\u03a6A B (x1 , x2 ) =\n\nX\n\n(eiPn X \u03a8n,A (+)B (x, Pn ) + e\u2212iPn X \u03a8n,A (\u2212)B (x, Pn )), (2.2)\n\nPn ,n\n(\u00b1)\n\n2 = \u2212M 2 , P\nwhere the Fierz components \u03a8n are eigenfunctions of M2 ; Pn,\u03bc\nn,0 =\nn\np\n2\n2\nMn + Pn ; and the label (\u00b1) represents the positive (negative) frequency part; and\nn does a freedom of excitation. We have the following field theoretical expression for\nthe WF in mind as a guide for the present semi-phenomenological approach:\n\n\u03a6A B (x1 , x2 ) =\n\nX\nn\n\n[h0|\u03c8A (x1 )\u03c8\u0304 B (x2 )|Mn i + hMnc |\u03c8A (x1 )\u03c8\u0304 B (x2 )|0i], (2.3)\n\nwhere \u03c8A (\u03c8\u0304 B ) denotes the quark field (its Pauli-conjugate) and |Mn i (hMnc |) does\nthe composite meson (its charge conjugate) state. The internal WF is expanded in\nterms of a complete set {Wi } of free bi-Dirac spinors of quarks and anti-quarks as\n(\u00b1)B\n\n\u03a8A\n\n(x, Pn ) =\n\nX\n\n(\u00b1)\u03b2\n\nWi\u03b1\n\n(Pn )\u03c6a(\u00b1)b (x, Pn ).\n\n(2.4)\n\ni\n\n\u00a73.\n\nComplete Set of Spin Wave Function and Irreducible Meson\nComponents\n\nWe set up the conventional \"free\" Dirac quark-spinors with four-momentum\nof composite meson itself P = PM , uq (P\u03bc , sq ), which satisfies the Dirac equation,\n(iP * \u03b3 + M )uq (P\u03bc , sq ) = 0, where sq represents the spin up-down of the quark and\nP0 > 0 is the energy of the meson. In \u00a74 we consider the chiral transformation\nproperty of composite meson systems. Through chiral transformation, uq (P\u03bc , sq ) is\nrelated with \u03b35 uq (P\u03bc , sq ), which has the energy-momentum \u2212P\u03bc , since \u03b35 uq (P\u03bc , sq )\nsatisfies the Dirac equation (\u2212iP * \u03b3 + M ) \u03b35 uq (P\u03bc , sq ) = 0. Thus, \u03b35 uq (P\u03bc , sq ) \u223c\nuq (\u2212P\u03bc , sq ). We define (uq (P\u03bc , sq ), uq (\u2212P\u03bc , sq )), both of which are the solutions of\nthe above Dirac equation, as (uq (P\u03bc , sq ), uq (\u2212P\u03bc , sq )) = (u(P , sq ), \u2212sq v(P , \u2212sq )).\nConventional \"free\" Dirac antiquark-spinors with four-momentum P\u03bc , v\u0304 q\u0304 (P\u03bc , sq\u0304 ),\nsatisfies the Dirac equation, v\u0304 q\u0304 (P\u03bc , sq\u0304 )(\u2212iP * \u03b3 + M ) = 0, where sq\u0304 represents\nthe spin up-down of the antiquark. We define (v\u0304 q\u0304 (P\u03bc , sq\u0304 ), v\u0304 q\u0304 (\u2212P\u03bc , sq\u0304 )), both of\nwhich are the solutions of the above Dirac equation, as (v\u0304 q\u0304 (P\u03bc , sq\u0304 ), v\u0304 q\u0304 (\u2212P\u03bc , sq\u0304 )) =\n(v\u0304(P , sq\u0304 ), sq\u0304 \u016b(P , \u2212sq\u0304 )).\nIt is to be noted that all four spinors for both \"quarks and anti-quarks\" are\nnecessary to describe the spin WF of mesons. Then the complete set of bi-Dirac\n\n\f147\nspinors W (+) (P ) is given by\nU (P ) = uq (p1 , sq )v\u0304 q\u0304 (p2 , sq\u0304 )|pi,\u03bc =\u03bai P\u03bc = u(P , sq )v\u0304(P , sq\u0304 ),\nC(P ) = uq (p1 , sq )v\u0304 q\u0304 (\u2212p2 , sq\u0304 )|pi,\u03bc =\u03bai P\u03bc = u(P , sq )\u016b(P , \u2212sq\u0304 )sq\u0304 ,\nD(P ) = uq (\u2212p1 , sq )v\u0304 q\u0304 (p2 , sq\u0304 )|pi,\u03bc =\u03bai P\u03bc = \u2212sq v(P , \u2212sq )v\u0304(P , sq\u0304 ),\nV (P ) = uq (\u2212p1 , sq )v\u0304 q\u0304 (\u2212p2 , sq\u0304 )|pi,\u03bc =\u03bai P\u03bc = \u2212sq v(P , \u2212sq )\u016b(P , \u2212sq\u0304 )sq\u0304 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere in Eq.(3.1) we have defined technically the momenta of \"constituent quarks\"\u2217\nas\npi,\u03bc \u2261 \u03bai P\u03bc , p2i,\u03bc = \u2212m2i ; P\u03bc2 = \u2212M 2 , M = m1 + m2\n(\u03ba1,2 \u2261 m1,2 /(m1 + m2 ); \u03ba1 + \u03ba2 = 1).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe respective members in Eq.(3.1), Non-Relativistic, q\u0304-type and q-type Semi-Relativistic,\nand Extremely Relativistic ones, are expressed in terms of their irreducible composite\nmeson WF as follows:\n1\niP * \u03b3 \u03b2\n(N R)b\n(N R)b\nUA B (P ) = \u221a [(i\u03b35 Ps,a\n)]\u03b1 ,\n(P ) + i\u03b3\u03bc V\u03bc,a\n(P ))(1 +\nM\n2 2\n1\niP * \u03b3 \u03b2\n(q\u0304)b\n)]\u03b1 ,\nCA B (P ) = \u221a [(Sa(q\u0304)b (P ) + i\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc A\u03bc,a\n(P ))(1 \u2212\nM\n2 2\niP * \u03b3 \u03b2\n1\n(q)b\n(P ))(1 +\nDA B (P ) = \u221a [(Sa(q)b (P ) + i\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc A\u03bc,a\n)]\u03b1 ,\nM\n2 2\niP \u03b3 \u03b2\n1\n(ER)b\n(ER)b\n(P ) + i\u03b3\u03bc V\u03bc,a\n(P ))(1 \u2212\nVA B (P ) = \u221a [(i\u03b35 Ps,a\n)]\u03b1 ,\nM\n2 2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere all vector and axial-vector mesons satisfy the Lorentz conditions, P\u03bc V\u03bc (P ) =\nP\u03bc A\u03bc (P ) = 0. Here it is to be noted that, in each type of the above members,\nthe number of freedom counted both in the quark representation and in the meson\nrepresentation is equal, as it should be (2 \u00d7 2 = 4 and 1 + 3 = 4, respectively).\n\u00a74.\n\nLevel Classification and Chiral Symmetry\n\n4.1. Level structure of ground state mesons\nThus far we have presented a general covariant kinematical framework for describing the (ground states of) composite meson systems. However, what kinds of\nmesons do really exist or not, that is, the meson spectroscopy, is a dynamical (still\nunsolved) problem of QCD.\nFor this problem, we follow a physical idea of dynamically broken chiral symmetry of QCD, typically displayed in the NJL model: In the heavy quarkonium (QQ\u0304)\nsystem both quarks(Q) and antiquarks(Q\u0304) are possible to do, since mQ > \u039bconf ,\nonly non-relativistic motions with positive energy, and the LS-symmetry is good.\nIn so far as concerned with Eqs.

In the heavy-light quark meson Qq\u0304(q Q\u0304) system the q\u0304(q) make, since\nmq \u226a \u039bconf , relativistic motions both with positive and negative energies, and the\nchiral symmetry concerning q\u0304(q) is good. Accordingly both the U and C (U and\nD) are to be applied to the Qq\u0304(q Q\u0304) system, leading to possible existence of new\ncomposite scalar and axial-vector mesons(see Eq.(3.3)). In this meson system it is\nto be noted that the conventional heavy quark symmetry (HQS) is also valid as\nan approximate symmetry. In the light quark q q\u0304-meson system both quarks q and\nanti-quarks q\u0304 make, since mq \u226a \u039bconf , relativistic motion with both positive and\nnegative energies, and chiral symmetry is good. Accordingly the linear combinations\nof U and V are applied to the q q\u0304-system, and in this system there is a possiblity\nof existence of an extra(, in addition, to a normal) set of pseudo-scalar and vector\nmesons. Furthermore, the linear combinations of C and D are also applied, and\nnormal and extra sets of composite scalar and axial-vector mesons possibly exist as\nrelativistic S-wave bound states.\nIn the above discussion we assume that \u039bconf \u223c 1GeV regardless of quark-flavor.\nThe above expected level structure of ground states is summarized in Table I.\n4.2. Level structure of excited state mesons\nIn classifying the excited-state mesons we can proceed essentially similarly as\nthe case of ground state mesons. In the present approximation the masses of N-th\n2 = M 2 + N \u03a9 (M \u2261 M , \u03a9 being the inverse Regge\nexcited states are given by MN\nG\n0\nG\nslope), and their spin wave functions are defined by the same formulas as given in\n\u00a73 with substitution of constituent exciton-quark mass mi by\nm\u2217i = \u03b3N mi (\u03b3N \u2261 MN /MG ).\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe value of m\u2217i for the (q q\u0304) systems obtained by the formula (4.1) are seen m\u2217 \u226a\n\u039bconf for the lower levels, especially for the ground and first-excited states, and\n\n\f149\naccordingly we can expect that chiral symmetry for these states may be still good.\nSimilarly, in the (q Q\u0304)/(Qq\u0304) systems, the chiral symmetry concerning the light quark\nis also good for the several lower levels.\n4.3. Expected spectroscopy of mesons\nIn our fundamental equation Eq.(2.1) the squared-mass spectra M2 is, as a\nfirst step in the pure-confining force limit, assumed to be Dirac-spinor independent.\nActually we must take into account the various effects due to one-gluon-exchange\npotential and so on.\nlight \u2212 quark (q q\u0304) meson system: In the present approximation all the ground\n(N,E)\n\n(N,E)\n\n(N,E)\n\nstate mesons expected in \u00a73 , Ps\n, V\u03bc\n, S (N,E) and A\u03bc\nhave the mass, M0 =\n(N )\nm1 + m2 . Actually the mass of Ps , assigned to \u03c0-nonet, should be exceptionally\n(N )\nlow because of its nature\u2217 as a Nambu-Goldstone boson. The masses of the V\u03bc nonet, assigned to \u03c1-meson nonet, are known to be almost equal to M0 = m1 + m2 .\nThe masses of all the other ground-state mesons are expected to be almost equal to\n(N )\nthose of the V\u03bc -nonet, and to be lower than those of the first-excited states.\nFor the first-excited states, the chiral symmetry is expected to be still effective, so we expect the existence of a series of the first excited P -wave states of the\nground state multiplets. They have the masses, which are almost equal to the first\n(N )\nexcited states of V\u03bc -mesons and lower than the second excited states of them.\nAmong the multiplets newly predicted in the present scheme, to be called \"chiralons,\" the especially interesting mesons are the ones with the exotic quantum\n(N )\nnumbers; J P C =0+\u2212 (S (E) (S \u2212 wave)), 0\u2212\u2212 (A\u03bc (P \u2212 wave)), 1\u2212+ (S (E) (P \u2212 wave))\n(E)\nand 1\u2212+ (A\u03bc (P \u2212 wave)). Their masses, by the above mentioned estimate, is expected to be, respectively, m(0+\u2212 ) <\n\u223c 1.3 GeV and 1.3 GeV \u2243 m(0\u2212\u2212 ) \u2243 m(1\u2212+ ) \u2243\n<\nm(1\u2212+ ) \u223c 1.7 GeV.\nheavy \u2212 light quark (Qq\u0304 and q Q\u0304) meson system: As is seen from Table I we expect the existence of new S and A\u03bc multiplets (at least the ground states).\nheavy quark (QQ\u0304) meson system: No new multiplets are expected to exist.\n\n\u00a75. Experimental Evidences and Concluding Remarks\n\nIn this paper we have presented a kinematical framework for describing covariantly the ground states as well as excited states of light-through-heavy quark mesons.\nFor light-quark mesons our scheme gives a theoretical basis to classify the composite meson systems unifying the two contrasting viewpoints based on NRQM with\nLS symmetry and on NJL model with chiral symmetry. The essential physical assumption is to set up the bilocal Klein-Gordon equation (Yukawa equation) with the\nsquared-mass operator, which is, in the pure-confining force limit, independent of\nDirac-spinor suffix, and accordingly is chiral symmetric. As a result is pointed out\na possibility of existence of rather an abundant new nonets, chiralons, with masses\n\u2217\n\n(N)\n\nThe q q\u0304-condensation are possible for the S (N) , and Ps\n\n(E)\n\nother than Ps\n\nis a NG boson.\n\n\f150\nlower than about 2 GeV; several ground and excited-state meson nonets.\nFor heavy/light quark meson systems we have similarly pointed out a possibility\nof existence of new multiplets(triplets), chiralons.\nPresently we can give a few experimental candidates for the predicted new multiplets: One of the most important and interesting ones is the scalar \u03c3 nonet (the\nmembers are \u03c3(600), 4) \u03ba(900), 4) a0 (980) and f0 (980)) which constitutes, 5) with \u03c0nonet, a linear representation of the chiral SU (3) symmetry. It is notable that the\n\u03c3 nonet is the relativistic S-wave state, which should be discriminated from the 3 P0\nstate.\nNow the existence of three pseudoscalars 6) with mass between 1 GeV\u223c1.5GeV\n(\u03b7(1295), \u03b7(1420) and \u03b7(1460)) seems to be an established experimental fact. The\ntwo out of them may belong to the radially excited \u03c0-nonet, while the one extra to\n(E)\nthe ground states of the Ps -nonet newly predicted.\nAlso we have the other candidates for chiralons: Recently it seems that the\nexistence of two exotic particles 7) in the \u03b7\u03c0 system with J P C = 1\u2212+ and with a\nmass around 1.5 GeV \u03c01 (1400) and \u03c01 (1600) has been accepted widely. These two\nparticles have the mass in the region estimated in \u00a74.3 to be assigned as the respective\n(E)\nexcited P -wave states of S (E) and A\u03bc .\nWe have the longstanding problem in hadron spectroscopy: the mass and width\nof a1 (1260) seem to be variant 8) depending on the production process and/or decay\nchannel. We have made 9) recently a preliminary analysis of the data obtained by\nGAMS group WA102 experiment on process \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 3\u03c0 0 n, leading to an evidence of\nexistence of two a1 (J P C = 1++ ) particles: ac1 (m = 1.0GeV), and aN\n1 (m = 1.3GeV)\n(N ) 3\n(to be assigned, respectively, to A\u03bc ( S1 ), and to the conventional a1 particle).\nFinally we should like to refer to a preliminary result of analysis on the heavy/light\nquark meson systems that a scalar chiralon B0\u03c7 with M \u2243 5.52GeV may be observed 10) in the B\u03c0 channel.\nReferences\n[1] S.
