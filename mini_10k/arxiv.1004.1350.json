Introduction\nThe L2 -Index Theorem of Atiyah [1] expresses the index of an elliptic operator on a closed manifold M in terms of the G-equivariant\nf of M, with G the group of covering\nindex of some regular covering M\ntransformations. Atiyah's proof is analytic in nature. Our proof is\nalgebraic and involves an embedding of a given group into an acyclic\none, together with naturality properties of the indices.\n2. Review of the L2 -Index Theorem\nThe main reference for this section is Atiyah's paper [1]. All manifolds considered are smooth Riemannian, without boundary. Covering spaces of manifolds carry the induced smooth and Riemannian\nstructure. Let M be a closed manifold and let E, F denote two complex (Hermitian) vector bundles over M. Consider an elliptic pseudodifferential operator\nD : C \u221e (M, E) \u2192 C \u221e (M, F )\nacting on the smooth sections of the vector bundles. One defines its\nspace of solutions\nSD = {s \u2208 C \u221e (M, E) | Ds = 0}.\nThe complex vector space SD has finite dimension (see [13]), and so\nhas SD\u2217 the space of solutions of the adjoint D \u2217 of D where\nD \u2217 : C \u221e (M, F ) \u2192 C \u221e (M, E)\nis the unique continuous linear map satisfying\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217 \u2032\nhDs, s i = hDs(m), s (m)iF dm = hs, D s i = hs(m), D \u2217 s\u2032 (m)iE dm\nM\n\nM\n\nfor all s \u2208 C \u221e (M, E), s\u2032 \u2208 C \u221e (M, F ). One now defines the index of\nD as follows:\nIndex(D) = dimC (SD ) \u2212 dimC (SD\u2217 ) \u2208 Z.\nDate: July 2, 2003.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nINDIRA CHATTERJI AND GUIDO MISLIN\n\nAn explicit formula for Index(D) is given by the famous Atiyah-Singer\nTheorem (cf.

Write\nN(G) = {P : l2 (G) \u2192 l2 (G) bounded and G-invariant}\n\nfor the group von Neumann algebra of G, where G acts on l2 (G) via the\nright regular representation. Then SDe is a finitely generated Hilbert\nG-module and hence can be represented by an idempotent matrix P =\n(pij ) \u2208 Mn (N(G)) (recall that a finitely generated Hilbert G-module\nis isometrically G-isomorphic to a Hilbert G-subspace of the Hilbert\nspace l2 (G)n for some n \u2265 1, see [9]). One then sets\nn\nX\nhpii (e), ei = \u03ba(P ) \u2208 R,\ndimG (SDe ) =\ni=1\n\nwhere by abuse of notation e denotes the element in l2 (G) taking value\n1 on the neutral element e \u2208 G and 0 elsewhere (see Eckmann's survey\n[9] on L2 -cohomology for more on von Neumann dimensions).

Hilbert modules\nRecall that for H < G and X an H-space, the induced G-space is\nG \u00d7H X = (G \u00d7 X)/H\nwhere H acts on G \u00d7 X via h * (g, x) = (gh\u22121 , hx) and the left Gaction on G \u00d7H X is given by g * [k, x] = [gk, x] (where [k, x] denotes\nthe class of the pair (k, x) \u2208 G \u00d7 X in G \u00d7H X).

This is not the case in general,\nsee Example 2.2.\n\n\fL2 -INDEX THEOREM\n\n5\n\n4. On K-homology\nMany ideas of this section go back to the seminal article by Baum\nand Connes [3], which has been circulating for many years and has only\nrecently been published.\nAn elliptic pseudo-differential operator D on the closed manifold M\ncan also be used to define an element [D] \u2208 K0 (M), the K-homology\nof M, and according to Baum and Douglas [4], all elements of K0 (M)\nare of the form [D]. The index defined in Section 2 extends to a welldefined homomorphism (cf. [4])\nIndex : K0 (M) \u2192 Z,\nsuch that Index([D]) = Index(D). On the other hand, the projection\npr : M \u2192 {pt} induces, after identifying K0 ({pt}) with Z, a homomorphism\npr\u2217 : K0 (M) \u2192 Z,\n(\u2217)\nwhich, as explained in [4], satisfies\npr\u2217 ([D]) = Index([D]).\nMore generally (cf. [4]), for a not necessarily finite CW-complex X,\nevery x \u2208 K0 (X) is of the form f\u2217 [D] for some f : M \u2192 X, and\nK0 (X) is obtained as a colimit over K0 (M\u03b1 ), where the M\u03b1 form a\ndirected system consisting of closed Riemannian manifolds (these homology groups K0 (X) are naturally isomorphic to the ones defined using the Bott spectrum; sometimes, they are referred to as K-homology\ngroups with compact supports). The index map from above extends to\na homomorphism\nIndex : K0 (X) \u2192 Z,\nsuch that Index(x) = Index([D]) if x = f\u2217 [D], with f : M \u2192 X.\nWe now consider the case of X = BG, the classifying space of the\ndiscrete group G, and obtain thus for any f : M \u2192 BG a commutative\ndiagram\nIndex\nK0 (M) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nf\u2217 y\nIndex\n\nK0 (BG) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z.\nNote that (\u2217) from above implies the following naturality property for\nthe index homomorphism.\n\nLemma 4.1. For any homomorphism \u03c6 : H \u2192 G one has a commutative diagram\nIndex\nK0 (BH) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n(B\u03c6)\u2217 y\nIndex\n\nK0 (BG) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z.\n\n\f6\n\nINDIRA CHATTERJI AND GUIDO MISLIN\n\n\u0003\nWe now turn to the L2 -index of Section 2. It extends to a homomorphism\nIndexG : K0 (BG) \u2192 R\nas follows. Each x \u2208 K0 (BG) is of the form f\u2217 (y) for some y = [D] \u2208\nK0 (M), f : M \u2192 BG, M a closed smooth manifold and D an elliptic\ne be the lifted operator to M,\nf the G-covering\noperator on M. Let D\nspace induced by f : M \u2192 BG. Then put\ne\nIndexG (x) := IndexG (D).\n\nOne checks that IndexG (x) is indeed well-defined, either by direct computation, or by identifying it with \u03c4 (x), where \u03c4 denotes the composite of the assembly map K0 (BG) \u2192 K0 (Cr\u2217 G) with the natural trace\nK0 (Cr\u2217 G) \u2192 R (for this latter point of view, see Higson-Roe [10]; for a\ndiscussion of the assembly map see e.g. Kasparov [12], or Valette [14]).\nThe following naturality property of this index map is a consequence\nof Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 4.2. For H < G the following diagram commutes\nIndex\n\nH\nR\nK0 (BH) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nIndex\n\nG\nK0 (BG) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nR.\n\n\u0003\nAtiyah's L2 -Index Theorem 2.1 for a given G can now be expressed as\nthe statement (as already observed in [10])\nIndexG = Index : K0 (BG) \u2192 R.\n5. Algebraic proof of Atiyah's L2 -index theorem\nRecall that a group A is said to be acyclic if H\u2217 (BA, Z) = 0 for \u2217 > 0.\nFor G a countable group, there exists an embedding G \u2192 AG into a\ncountable acyclic group AG . There are many constructions of such a\ngroup AG available in the literature, see for instance Kan-Thurston [11,\nProposition 3.5], Berrick-Varadarajan [5] or Berrick-Chatterji-Mislin\n[6]; these different constructions are to be compared in Berrick's forthcoming work [7]. It follows that the suspension \u03a3BAG is contractible,\nand therefore the inclusion {e} \u2192 AG induces an isomorphism\n\u223c\n=\n\nK0 (B{e}) \u2212\u2192 K0 (BAG ).\nOur strategy is as follows. We show that the Atiyah L2 -Index Theorem holds in the special case of acyclic groups, and finish the proof\ncombining the above embedding of a group into an acyclic group.\n\n\fL2 -INDEX THEOREM\n\n7\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1. If a group A is acyclic, the equation IndexA =\nIndex follows from the diagram\nK0 (BA)\nx\n\uf8e6\n\u223c\n=\uf8e6\n\nIndex\n\nIndex\n\nA\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nR \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212 K0 (BA)\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u223c\n=\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nIndex{e}\n\nIndex\n\n=\n\n=\n\nK0 (B{e}) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u223c\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z \u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2212 K0 (B{e})\n\u223c\nbecause Index{e} = Index on the bottom line. For a general group\nG, consider an embedding into an acyclic group AG and complete the\nproof by using Lemma 3.1, together with Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] M. F. Atiyah.
