Introduction\nString field theory [1] (see [2] for a review of recent developments) is a theory of an infinite\nset of interacting fields. This supplies us with a huge variety of field configurations, some\nof which lead to anomalous or contradicting results. Therefore, finding the appropriate\nstring field space, which does not lead to contradictions, but still contains all the essential\nphysics, is a major task of string field theory [3, 4].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fA space with a finite number of modes is too restrictive. Specifically, the non-trivial\nsolutions of the string field equation of motion\nQB \u03a8 + \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8 = 0 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nmust have an infinite number of modes. The analytical solution to the above equation is\nnot known, still it is obvious that it will involve an infinite number of modes, due to the fact\nthat states with a finite number of excited modes do not form a subalgebra with respect to\nthe star-product. It is very plausible that the \"correct space of states\" is actually a starsubalgebra, even if this assertion is somewhat less obvious than it is for non-polynomial\nstring field theories, such as [5, 6, 7]. In fact, the star-subalgebra structure is in the heart\nof string field theory. Moreover, it is clear that such a structure is vital at the perturbative\nlevel, as the cubic vertex describes an interaction where from two incoming fields \u03a81 , \u03a82\nwe get an outgoing field \u03a81 \u22c6 \u03a82 . Understanding the structure of star-subalgebras can help\nus in the search for the \"correct space of states\".\nWe can find star-subalgebras by looking at the form of the three-vertex. The threevertex can be written as a squeezed state over a direct product of three Fock spaces [8, 9,\n10, 11, 12]. Therefore, squeezed states form a subalgebra Hsq . States in this subalgebra\nare represented (for a single matter coordinate) as\n1 \u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n|Si = e\u2212 2 an Snm am |0i .\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe call Snm \"the defining matrix\" of the squeezed state. Another subalgebra Huniv [13, 14]\nis defined by acting on the vacuum with the ghost oscillators bn , cn and the matter Virasoro\noperators Lmatt\n. Since the tachyon potential only involves states in this subalgebra, the\nn\nsolution to the SFT e.o.m. should be in this subalgebra. Surface states [15, 16] also form\na subalgebra H\u03a3 , which is contained in the previously mentioned subalgebras\nH\u03a3 \u2282 Hsq ,\n\nH\u03a3 \u2282 Huniv .\n\n(1.3)\n\nSqueezed states are described by the infinite defining matrices. Surface states can\nbe described using a conformal map f (z) from the upper half plane to some Riemann\nsurface. Two different criteria were given for a squeezed state to be also a surface state.\nThe first criterion [17] is based on the original relation between surface states and squeezed\nstates [15]. The second criterion is bases on the integrability of the tau function [18]. In\nsection 2 we prove that the two criteria are equivalent. Then, in section 3, we generalize the\ncriterion for the ghost sector and for the twisted ghost system. We also show that several\ndifferent criteria are possible, relating different rows or columns to the whole matrix.\nStar-subalgebras can be especially useful when the star-product in them gets a simple\nform. In [19], the matrices M rs , which define the three-vertex, were diagonalized. The\nbasis in which these matrices are diagonal is continuous and labeled by \u2212\u221e < \u03ba < \u221e. In\nthis basis the squeezed state defining matrices become two parameter functions, S(\u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 ).\nIt should be noted, that while the star-product simplifies in this basis, the form of QB ,\nwhich is the kinetic operator in (1.1) is quite cumbersome [20, 21, 22, 23]. States with\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fmatrices diagonal in the \u03ba basis,\nS(\u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 ) = s(\u03ba)\u03b4(\u03ba + \u03ba\u2032 ) ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nform a subalgebra, which we call H\u03ba . This subalgebra is very limited. For example, it only\nallows for twist invariant states and the only projectors in this subalgebra are the sliver\nand the identity. The wedge states, which themselves form a subalgebra HW , are in this\nsubalgebra. In this paper we prove that they are the only surface states in this subalgebra,\nHW = H\u03ba \u2229 H\u03a3 .\n\n(1.5)\n\nOne can get a larger subalgebra by taking squeezed states with a defining matrix block\ndiagonal in \u00b1\u03ba,\nS(\u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 ) = s13 (\u03ba)\u03b4(\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u2032 ) + s2 (\u03ba)\u03b4(\u03ba + \u03ba\u2032 ) .\n\n(1.6)\n\nThis is the H\u03ba2 subalgebra of [17]. This subalgebra is already much larger than H\u03ba . A state\nin this subalgebra can be represented by a function from \u03ba > 0 to R3 . This can be seen\nfrom (1.6) by noting that s2 (\u03ba) must be an even function, while there are no conditions on\ns13 (\u03ba). There are also many projectors in this space. The intersection H\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 contains,\nin addition to the wedge states, also the butterflies [17]. The butterflies [24, 25, 26],\nunlike the wedge states, do not form a subalgebra by themselves. The minimal subalgebra\ncontaining the butterflies is the subalgebra HB of hybrid butterflies. A hybrid butterfly is\na non twist invariant state, which is the result of star-multiplying two different (purebred)\nbutterflies. In section 4, we introduce these states and describe their properties and the\nsubalgebra HB , as well as HBW , which contains the wedges and the butterflies. The hybrid\nbutterflies are (non-orthogonal) projectors and as such they have a mid-point singularity.\nIn the continuous basis this translates into a singularity at \u03ba = 0. It would seem that the\nconformal map f (z) of these states should obey f (i) = \u221e, but this is not the case.\nIn section 5, our aim is to find all the surface states in H\u03ba2 . In order to investigate\nthis subalgebra we start with the condition for a surface state to be in H\u03ba2 found in [17].\nA variant of this condition was found in [27] for the twisted ghost system. Here, we show\nthat these conditions are equivalent to a first order differential equation. We then study\nthe PSL(2) properties of this equation and find all its solutions. The result is that the only\nsurface states in H\u03ba2 are the wedge states and the hybrid butterflies of section 4, that is,\nHBW = H\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 .\n\n(1.7)\n\nFinally, in section 6 we investigate the geometric meaning of the above differential\nequation and find generalizations thereof that are related to the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping. The surfaces that the Schwarz-Christoffel type integrals describe map the upper\nhalf plane to convex polygons which may also have conical singularities. We show that\nthese \"generalized Schwarz-Christoffel\" maps can be used to define an infinite number of\nstar-subalgebras.\nWhile this work was nearing completion the paper [28] appeared, which overlaps parts\nof our sections 3.2, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\f2. The equivalence of the two surface state criteria\nBefore we show the equivalence of the surface state criteria for matter sector squeezed\nstates, we introduce the two criteria and fix our notations. The squeezed state defining\nmatrix S of (1.2) can be represented using the generating function\nS(z, w) \u2261\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u221a\n\nnmSnm z n\u22121 wm\u22121 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nn,m=1\n\nThe inverse transformation is\n1\nSnm = \u221a\nnm\n\nI\n\ndzdw S(z, w)\n.\n(2\u03c0i)2 z n wm\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe criterion given in [17] is based on the fact that for a surface state, S(z, w) should have\nthe form [15]\n1\nf \u2032 (\u2212z)f \u2032 (\u2212w)\nS(z, w) =\n\u2212\n,\n(2.3)\n(z \u2212 w)2 (f (\u2212z) \u2212 f (\u2212w))2\nwhere f (z) is the conformal transformation defining the surface state in the CFT language.\nNote that the first term does not contribute to the contour integral. Its purpose is to remove\nthe singularity at z = w. In this case, f (z) can be found from S(z, w) using\nf (z) =\n\nz\n.\nR \u2212z\n1 \u2212 z 0 S(z\u0303, 0)dz\u0303\n\n(2.4)\n\nThus, the algorithm for surface state identification is composed of the following steps:\n\u2022 Calculate S(z, w) using (2.1).\n\u2022 Find a candidate conformal transformation f c (z) using (2.4).\n\u2022 Substitute f c(z) back in (2.3) and check whether it reproduces S(z, w) correctly.\n\u2022 If it does then S is a surface state with the conformal map f (z) = f c (z), otherwise\nit is not a surface state.\nConformal maps, which are related by a PSL(2) transformation, describe the same state,\nand share the same matrix S. For a given S, eq.

They write the\nstate in their eq.

There are three convention\ndifferences, a minus sign in the definition of N , the use of the modes \u03b1\u2212n instead of a\u2020n and\nthe use of the conformal transformation f \u0303. The first two differences are taken care of by\nsetting\n1\nNnm = \u2212 \u221a\nSnm .\n(2.9)\nnm\nThe two conformal maps can be related by a BPZ conjugation\n1\nf \u0303(z\u0303) = f (\u2212 ) = f (\u2212z) ,\nz\u0303\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere in the last equality we used z = z\u0303 \u22121 . Now (2.2),(2.3) are equivalent to (2.7). We\nnote that the use of a conformal transformation regular at infinity, as well as the orientation\nchange, are more commonly used in the definition of a bra than of a ket. Still, the definitions\nof [18] are consistent. In any case, most states considered in the literature are BPZ-real.\nFor these states the matrices defining the ket and bra states are the same, and the minus\nsign in the argument of f in (2.3) is inessential.\nThe criterion found in [18] is based on the relation of the matrix N to the matrix of\nsecond derivatives of the tau function of analytic curves. The tau function obeys the Hirota\nidentities. The relevant identities essentially state that the matrix of second derivatives is\ndetermined from a single row. These relation are summarized in eq. (3.8) of [18], which we\nrewrite in terms of N and the z, w variables\nexp\n\n\u221e\n\u0010 X\n\nn\n\nNnm z w\n\nn,m=1\n\nm\n\n\u0011\n\n=1\u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\nk\nk=1 N1k (z \u2212\n\u22121\nz \u2212 w\u22121\n\nwk )\n\n(2.11)\n\n.\n\nWe can use this equation to write Nnm in terms of its first row as1\nNnm\n\n1\n=\n(2\u03c0i)2\n\nI\n\ndzdw\nlog(1 \u2212 x) ,\nn+1\nz\nwm+1\n\nx\u2261\n\nP\u221e\n\nk\nk=1 N1k (z \u2212\nz \u22121 \u2212 w\u22121\n\nwk )\n\n.\n\n(2.12)\n\nIt is interesting to note that\n(N1n = 0 n \u22612 0) \u21d2 (Nnm = 0 n + m \u22612 1) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\n\nThis expression can be better understood by writing x = \u2212zw k=1 N1k (z k\u22121 + z k\u22122 w + ... + wk\u22121 )\nP\nxl\nand using the Taylor expansion log(1 \u2212 x) = \u2212( \u221e\nl=1 l ). The expression for Nnm is a sum with coefficients\nl1\nla\nc~k,~l;n,m of all monomials of the form N1,k1 * ... * N1,ka , where the ki are all distinct, such that \"the total\nPa\nindex is conserved\", and the \"total power\" is not higher than n, m. That is, l \u2261\ni=1 li \u2264 min(n, m),\nPa\n(l\u22121)!\nlQ\n~\n~\nl\n(k\n+\n1)\n=\nl\n+\nl\n*\nk\n=\nn\n+\nm.\nThe\ncoefficient\nof\nthis\nmonomial\nis\nc\n=\n\u2212(\u22121)\nc\u0303k,~l;m\u2212l ,\n~\ni=1 i i\nk,~\nl;n,m\n(li !) ~\nQa\n\n(1\u2212uki )li\n\n1\nare solutions of the combinatorial problem of\n\u2202um\u2212l i=1(1\u2212u)l\nand the coefficients c\u0303~k,~l;m\u2212l = (m\u2212l)!\nu=0\ndividing m \u2212 l identical \"balls\" into l boxes, with the size of the first l1 boxes adequate for at most k1 \u2212 1\nballs, and so on. The fact that c\u0303~k,~l;m\u2212l = c\u0303~k,~l;n\u2212l , can be seen from the symmetry of interchanging \"balls\"\nand \"holes\".\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fThus, a surface state is twist invariant iff its defining matrix does not mix a\u20201 with even\ncreation modes.\nThese relations among the N matrix elements may seem different from the criterion\nof [17] described above. We now turn to prove that they are indeed equivalent. We\nrewrite (2.1) as\n\u221e\nX\nnmNnm z n\u22121 wm\u22121 .\n(2.14)\nS(z, w) \u2261 \u2212\nn,m=1\n\nEq. (2.4) can be written more explicitly as\nf (z) =\n\nz\n,\n1 \u2212 zh(\u2212z)\n\nh(z) \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz n N1n .\n\n(2.15)\n\nn=1\n\nFrom here we can infer that the condition (2.13) of twist invariance is equivalent to f (z)\nbeing an odd function. Now, eq. (2.2),(2.3) give Nnm in terms of N1k via\nI\n1\ndzdw 1 (1 \u2212 z 2 h\u2032 (z))(1 \u2212 w2 h\u2032 (w))\nNnm =\n(2.16)\n\u0001 .\nnm\n(2\u03c0i)2 z n wm z \u2212 w \u2212 zw(h(z) \u2212 h(w) 2\nThis already looks quite similar to (2.12). Rewriting x in (2.12) as\nzw\n(h(z) \u2212 h(w)) ,\nx=\nz\u2212w\n\n(2.17)\n\nand integrating by parts with respect to z, w, again disregarding the term (z \u2212 w)\u22122 ,\nbrings (2.12) exactly to (2.16). Thus, both criteria are one and the same.\n\n3. Surface states in the ghost sector\nWe now repeat the computations of the matter sector for the ghost sector, for the regular\nghost and the twisted ghost cases, and find which ghost squeezed state matrices are related\nto surface states. The major difference is that the defining metric is not symmetric anymore,\nbecause it relates the b and c ghosts. It is also possible to consider squeezed states that\nare bi-linear with respect to b or c oscillators. While such states can generate symmetries\nin string field theory [29] they are not surface states, since surface states have a definite\n(zero) ghost number. Thus, in the ghost sector we consider only states of the form,\n|Si = ec\u2212n Snm b\u2212m |0i .\n\n(3.1)\n\nTherefore, in the ghost sector, we will get two different conditions on S. The difference\nbetween them is that one condition reproduces the matrix S from a single row while the\nother uses a single column.\nAnother difference of the ghost sector is that we have zero-modes that need to be\nsaturated. We will find a condition for both the regular ghost sector and the twisted\nghost sector. These have different conformal weights and therefore different number of\nzero-modes. The standard ghost system is a bc system with conformal weights (hb , hc ) of\n(2, \u22121) and three zero-modes. The vacuum in this sector is normalized as,\nh0| c\u22121 c0 c1 |0i = 1 .\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fFrom here we see that the summation in (3.1) is in the range n \u2265 \u22121, m \u2265 2 in this\ncase. The twisted ghost is a bc system with conformal weights (hb , hc ) of (1, 0) and one\nzero-mode. Now, the vacuum is normalized as,\nh0| c0 |0i = 1 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand the summation in (3.1) is in the range n \u2265 0, m \u2265 1. We treat the regular ghost\nsystem in subsection 3.1, and the twisted ghost system in subsection 3.2.\n3.1 The regular ghost sector\nThe generating function of the defining matrix for a given surface state in this case is [15,\n30],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf \u2032 (z)2 f \u2032 (w)\u22121 f (w) \u2212 f (0) 3\n1 \u0010 w \u00113\nS(z, w) =\n.\n(3.4)\n\u2212\nf (z) \u2212 f (w)\nf (z) \u2212 f (0)\nz\u2212w z\n\nThe generating function is related to the matrix S by,\nS(z, w) =\n\nX\n\nn+m\n\n(\u22121)\n\nw\n\nm+1 n\u22122\n\nz\n\nSnm ,\n\nn+m\n\nSnm = (\u22121)\n\nI\n\n0\n\nn,m\n\ndzdw S(z, w)\n.\n(2\u03c0i)2 z n\u22121 wm+2\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe get the first condition on the ghost generating function by taking the most dominant\ncontribution from the expansion around z = 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nf (w)2\n1\n3\n2\nSc1 (w) \u2261 lim z S(z, w) = w \u2212 \u2032\n,\n(3.6)\nS(z, w) = 3 Sc1 (w) + O( 2 ) ,\nz\u21920\nz\nz\nf (w)\nwhere we imposed (2.5). We can integrate the equation above to get,\nZ w\n1\n1\n1\ndw =\n\u2212\n.\n2\nf (w0 ) f (w)\nw0 w \u2212 Sc1 (w)\n\n(3.7)\n\nHowever, we cannot set w0 = 0, as we would like to, since the equation is singular there.\nTo bypass this obstacle we modify the integrand slightly,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nZ w\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\ndw =\n\u2212\n.\n(3.8)\nw2 \u2212 Sc1 (w) w2\nf (w0 ) w0\nf (w) w\nw0\nNow, we can take the limit w0 \u2192 0. The lower integration limit is well defined, since\nSc1 (w) \u2248 w4 , as can be seen from (3.6). Moreover, the limit of the expression in the first\nparenthesis is zero, and we get a condition on the candidate conformal map,\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u22121\nZ w\n1\nSc1 (w)\nc\nf (w) =\n.\n(3.9)\ndw\n\u2212\nw\nw4 \u2212 w2 Sc1 (w)\n0\nThis map obeys (2.5) by construction, and it should reproduce S(z, w) when plugged back\ninto (3.4), provided S(z, w) describes a surface state.\nThe second condition comes from expanding the generating function around w = 0\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032 2\n1\nf (z)\n3\n4\n\u22123\n\u2212 4 .

The second condition gives the same\nin terms of Sb\u22122 (z), which is equivalent to the b\u22122 column in the same matrix. We note\nthat from both equations we can deduce that the matrix element S1,\u22122 = 0 for all surface\nstates. That is, the first column or row contain slightly more than enough information to\ndetermine the matrix. We can see that it is not possible to get to a function which obeys\nthe initial conditions (2.5) when S1,\u22122 6= 0.\nThis curiosity is related to the fact that we chose the first row and column. This\nrestriction is not necessary. We could have gotten other conditions from other rows or\ncolumns. In fact, this is possible also in the matter sector. This multiplicity of conditions\nis not peculiar to the ghost sector. It is even possible to get conditions from a diagonal of\nthe matrix and other data. However, conditions on higher rows or columns become harder\nto solve and simultaneously become not restrictive enough. The higher we go in the rows or\ncolumns the less information we can get. This phenomenon should probably be addressed\nwith the methods of [18].\nOur goal here is a criterion for which the entire matrix is exactly equivalent to a single\nrow or column, provided it describes a surface state. As the first ones are too restrictive,\nwe examine the criteria coming form the second row and column. These row and column\nare indeed equivalent to the whole matrix. We define Sc0 (w) and Sb\u22123 (z) as the next terms\nin the expansions (3.6) and (3.10) respectively. In a similar way to the above we now get,\nRw\n\ndw\n\nSc0 (w)\n\nw \u2212wSc0 (w)\n,\nf c (w) = we 0\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0011\u0013\u2212 32\n3 z \u0010q\nc\n\u2212 23\n\u2212 25\n\u22125\nf (z) = z \u2212\ndz\nSb\u22123 (z) + z \u2212 z\n.\n2 0\n2\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\n3.2 The twisted ghost system\n\nThe generating function in the twisted ghost case is [15, 24],\nS(z, w) =\n\nf (w) \u2212 f (0)\n1 w\nf \u2032 (z)\n\u2212\n.\nf (z) \u2212 f (w) f (z) \u2212 f (0)\nz\u2212w z\n\nNow the relation to the matrix S is given by,\nI\nX\ndzdw S(z, w)\nn+m m n\u22121\nn+m\nS(z, w) =\n(\u22121)\nw z\nSnm ,\nSnm = (\u22121)\n.\n2 n m+1\n0 (2\u03c0i) z w\nn,m\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\n\nIn the twisted ghost case the row n = 1 and the column m = 1 are equivalent to the whole\nmatrix for a surface state, as is the case also in the matter sector. The first row condition\ncomes from the expansion around z = 0,\nS(z, w) = Sc\u22121 (w) + O(z) ,\n\nSc\u22121 (w) \u2261 S(0, w) = w\u22121 \u2212 f (w)\u22121 .\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fThe condition in this case is extremely simple and involves no integration,\n\u0001\u22121\nf c (w) = w\u22121 \u2212 Sc\u22121 (w)\n.\n\n(3.17)\n\nWe do note, however, that while in the general case (3.15) implies that the leading term in\nthe expansion is of order O(z \u22121 ), this term is absent for surface states, Sc0 (w) = 0. That is,\nthe coefficients of c0 in the defining matrix are zero for surface states. This is reminiscent\nof the matter sector, where surface states do not depend on the zero-mode.\nThe first column condition comes from the expansion around w = 0\nS(z, w) = wSb\u22121 (z) + O(w2 ) ,\n\nSb\u22121 (z) \u2261 lim w\u22121 S(z, w) =\nw\u21920\n\nf \u2032 (z)\n1\n\u2212\n,\nf (z)2 z 2\n\n(3.18)\n\nand gives the candidate conformal map\nc\n\nf (z) =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212\nz\n\nZ\n\nz\n0\n\n\u0013\u22121\n.\nSb\u22121 (z)\n\n(3.19)\n\nNotice that this last condition is very similar to the condition (2.4) for the matter sector.\nThe relation between the twisted ghost and the matter sector can be made more\nconcrete by inserting (3.14) into (2.4), integrating by parts once with respect to w, and\ncomparing with (2.3). The result is [30, 31],\nSmatter = \u2212E \u22121 Sghost E ,\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere the matrix E is defined as usual,\n\u221a\nEnm = \u03b4n,m n .\n\n(3.21)\n\n4. The hybrid butterflies\nThe (regular) butterfly states are surface state rank one projectors [24, 25, 26]. They are\ngiven by the conformal transformation,\n1\nsin(\u03b1u) ,\n\u03b1\n0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2,\nf=\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\nwhere\nu \u2261 tan\u22121 (z) ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nis the \u1e91 variable of [26]. We use this parameter extensively below.\nThe fact that they are rank one projectors means that their wave function factorizes\nto g(l)g(r), where l, r stand for the degrees of freedom on the left and right half strings\nrespectively and g is some functional of these degrees of freedom. In the half-string formalism [32, 33, 34, 35] we can represent such states by a matrix\nB = |gi hg| .\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fStar-multiplication in the half-string basis is represented as matrix multiplication and it is\nimmediately seen that any state of the form of (4.4) is a projector up to a normalization\nfactor hg| gi. We do not care here about normalization of the states and so we still refer to\na state as a projector if it is such up to a finite normalization, writing\nP2 \u2243 P .\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn fact, any state of the form\nP = |gi hh| ,\n\nhh| gi =\n6 0,\n\n(4.6)\n\nis a rank one (non-orthogonal) projector. The result of a multiplication of a rank one\nprojector by any state is again a projector, provided the projection of the state in the\ndirection of the projector is non-zero,\nP = |gi hh| ,\n\nhh| S |gi =\n6 0 =\u21d2 (P S)2 \u2243 (P S) .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe resulting state has the same left component as the original projector if the projector\nis on the left side of the multiplication as in (4.7) and vice versa if it is on the right side.\nIn particular, when we multiply two different orthogonal rank one projectors, the result is\na non-orthogonal projector with the left part of the first projector and right part of the\nsecond one. In the case of the butterflies we call the result a \"hybrid butterfly\", while\nreferring to the original butterflies as \"purebred\". As stated, a necessary condition for the\nexistence of these states is that the star-product of two distinct butterflies does not vanish.\nAs they are both rank one projectors it is enough to consider their inner product. While\nit was shown that this overlap vanishes in the matter sector [17], the total result of an\noverlap of any two surface states in unity [16].\nMultiplying two hybrid butterflies gives a hybrid or a purebred butterfly. These butterflies form a star-subalgebra HB , which is the minimal one containing the purebred\nbutterflies. It is clear that\n(4.8)\nHB \u2286 H\u03ba 2 \u2229 H\u03a3 .\nWe describe the hybrid butterflies from a conformal mapping point of view in 4.1, and\ntheir form in the \u03ba-basis in 4.2.\n4.1 Conformal mapping representation of the hybrid butterflies\nIn the u plane, the hybrid butterflies are represented by the infinite strip bounded between\nthe vertical lines in fig. 1. As the local coordinate patch should be inside this strip, the\nparameters \u03b1l,r have the usual domain (4.2). The conformal map describing this state is a\nmap of this bounded region onto the upper half plane. We use the simplest generalization\nof (4.1),\nf (u) = sin(\u03b1u + \u03b4) ,\n(4.9)\nwhere \u03b1 represents some kind of a mean value of \u03b1l,r and \u03b4 is a deviation from it.

The local coordinate patch is in grey. It is the image of the region I(z) \u2265 0, |z| \u2264 1 in the\nz plane under (4.3).\n\nWhile this conformal transformation describes the states well, it is not in the standard\nPSL(2) form (2.5).

When two\nsuch states are multiplied we have to remove the local coordinate patch from both, glue\nthe right side of the first with the left side of the second, and insert a local coordinate\npatch between the left side of the first and the right side of the second. We get in this way\ntwo surfaces with a single common point at infinity. This was called a \"pinching surface\"\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fin [26], where it was explained why the half surface without the local coordinate patch can\nbe discarded. This re-established the claim that\n\u03b11l , \u03b11r \u22c6 \u03b12l , \u03b12r = \u03b11l , \u03b12r .\n\n(4.14)\n\nWhile these states are rank one projectors, they do not obey f (u = \u221e) = \u221e. In [26] it\nwas suggested that rank one projectors should satisfy f (z = i) = \u221e, which is a manifestation of the left-right factorization of these states. Mathematically we can understand that\nf (z = i) is not well defined since this is an essential singularity of (4.3). For symmetric\nstates, as are the purebred butterflies, the directional limit gives the correct result, while\nin the general case it is harder to define it. Fig. 1 illustrates, however, that the left-right\nfactorization nevertheless holds.\nOne more observation we can make from fig. 1 is related to wedge states [14, 36, 37, 35].\nWedge states, like butterflies, are described by this figure, but with the two vertical lines\nidentified. Because of that there is no meaning to the separate length of the left and\nright parts, and there is no loss of generality by assuming that \u03b1l = \u03b1r . It is common to\nparametrize wedge states with the variable\nn=\n\n2\n,\n\u03b1\n\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 \u221e.\n\n(4.15)\n\nWith this parameter the conformal map describing wedge states is\nf (u) =\n\nn\n2\ntan( u) .\n2\nn\n\n(4.16)\n\nWedge states form a star-subalgebra HW , with multiplication rule\n|ni \u22c6 |mi = |n + m \u2212 1i .\n\n(4.17)\n\nIn [19] it was shown that wedge states are in H\u03ba and so\nHW \u2286 H\u03ba \u2229 H\u03a3 .\n\n(4.18)\n\nWe will show in section 5 that this is the whole subalgebra. Therefore, wedge states are\nthe only surface states, which are diagonal in the \u03ba basis.\nFrom the description of wedge states and butterflies using fig. 1, it is immediate that\nthe result of multiplying a butterfly |\u03b1l , \u03b1r i by a wedge state |ni is again a butterfly. In\nthis case the half surface which was previously discarded should be glued to the right side\n\u03c0\nto produce a length of (\u03b1\u22121\nr + (n \u2212 1)) 2 to the right of the origin (that includes one half\nof the coordinate patch). That is,\n\u22121\n.\n\u03b1l , \u03b1r \u22c6 n = \u03b1l , (\u03b1\u22121\nr + n \u2212 1)\n\n(4.19)\n\nWe conclude that the butterflies HB together with wedge states HW produce again a\nstar-subalgebra, which we label HBW . Again, it is clear that\nHBW \u2286 H\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 .\nWe will show in section 5 that this is the whole subalgebra.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(4.20)\n\n\f4.2 The hybrid butterflies in the \u03ba basis\nAs the hybrid butterflies are in H\u03ba2 we can use the methods of [17, 38] to find their form in\nthe \u03ba-basis and the half-string \u03ba-basis respectively. We refer to these papers for technical\ndetails and conventions, and continue briefly. First we find F1 (\u03be), F2 (\u03b6) with the methods\nof section 3.3 of [17]. Parameterizing the states by \u03b1, \u03b4 they read,\nF1\u03b1,\u03b4 (\u03be) =\n4 cosh\nF2\u03b1,\u03b4 (\u03b6) =\n\n\u03b12\n\u0010\n\n\u03b1\u03be\n2\n\n\u2212 i\u03b4\n\n(4.21)\n\n\u00112 ,\n\n\u03b12\n1\n.\n\u0010 \u00112 \u2212\nsinh(\u03b6)2\n4 sinh \u03b1\u03b6\n2\n\n(4.22)\n\nEq. (4.22) does not depend on \u03b4. Thus, s2 (\u03ba) of a hybrid butterfly is the same as that of\nthe appropriate purebred butterfly,\n\u0010 \u03ba\u03c0 \u0011\n\u0010 \u03ba\u03c0 \u0011\n\u0010 \u03ba\u03c0 \u0011\ns2 (\u03ba) = cosh\n\u2212 coth\nsinh\n.\n(4.23)\n2\n\u03b1\n2\n\nThe dependence of (4.21) on \u03b4 is very simple and the contour integral can be evaluated as\nin [17]. Note that no singularity can emerge from deforming the contour due to the domain\nof \u03b4 (4.12). The resulting matrix elements are,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nsinh \u03ba\u03c0\nsinh \u03ba\u03c0\n2 \u0001 2\u03ba\u03b4\n2 \u0001 \u2212 2\u03ba\u03b4\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 .\ns1 (\u03ba) = s13 (\u2212\u03ba) =\n(4.24)\ne ,\ns3 (\u03ba) = s13 (\u03ba) =\n\u03ba\u03c0 e\nsinh \u03ba\u03c0\nsinh\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nThis is the representation of the hybrid butterflies in the \u03ba-basis.\nTo check the special case where we have a sliver on one side we should either substitute (4.10) in (4.24) and take the limit where either \u03b1l,r \u2192 0, or find F1,2 directly\nfrom (4.13),\n\u03b22\n\nF1\u03b2 (\u03be) =\n\n(4.25)\n\n,\n(1 + i\u03b2\u03be)2\n1\n1\nF2\u03b2 (\u03b6) = 2 \u2212\n.\n\u03b6\nsinh(\u03b6)2\n\n(4.26)\n\nIn any case we get\ns2 = e\u2212\ns1 =\n\n(\n\n\u03ba\n\u2212\u03b2\n\ne\n\nsinh\n0\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03b2>0\n,\n\u03b2<0\n\n\u03ba\u03c0\n2\n\n(4.27)\n\n,\ns3 =\n\n(\n\n\u03ba\n\u2212 |\u03b2|\n\ne\n\n0\nsinh\n\n\u03ba\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b2>0\n.\n\u03b2<0\n\n(4.28)\n\nNote that s13 is not analytic in this limit.\nTo get the form of these states in the continuous half-string (sliver) basis we use (A.24,\n3.12) of [38] to get,\n!\n\u03ba\u03c0\ne\u2212 2 al\n0\nh\nS\u03b1l,r =\n,\n(4.29)\n\u03ba\u03c0\n0\ne\u2212 2 ar\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fwhere we used the parametrization\nal,r =\n\n2\n\u2212 1,\n\u03b1l,r\n\n(4.30)\n\nas in (4.13) of [38]. We see that the hybrid butterflies, which are rank one projectors, factor\nto left and right parts, as they should, according to (4.6). We recognize these factors as\nthe left part of the butterfly al and the right part of the butterfly ar . In fact this could\nhave been our starting point instead of (4.11).\n\n5. Surface states in H\u03ba2\nWhile searching for a squeezed state projector, a simplifying ansatz was made in [39],\n[CS, K1 ] = 0 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nHere S is the defining matrix, C is the twist matrix and K1 is defined by the Virasoro\ngenerator K1 = L1 + L\u22121 and has a continuous spectrum \u2212\u221e < \u03ba < \u221e. These states form\nthe H\u03ba subalgebra. In [17], this ansatz was generalized by searching for squeezed states\nobeying\n[S, K21 ] = 0 .\n(5.2)\nSqueezed states that are block diagonal in \u00b1\u03ba form a subalgebra of the star-product,\nwhich was dubbed H\u03ba2 . It was found that this space is very large and in fact equivalent\nto the space of functions from \u03ba > 0 to R3 . It turned out that the projectors of H\u03ba2\nconsist of the identity string field and a family of rank one projectors. These rank one\nprojectors are described by functions from \u03ba > 0 to R2 . A criterion was given for a general\nsqueezed state to be in H\u03ba2 . This criterion was combined with the criterion for a state to\nbe a surface state (2.3) in order to identify which surface states are in H\u03ba2 . States that\nsatisfy this condition form a subalgebra of the star-product, as it is the intersection of two\nsubalgebras, H\u03ba2 and H\u03a3 . The resulting expression, although very simple and symmetric\nin form, did not allow for a full description of this star-subalgebra.\nThis expression was later refined in [27] for the twisted ghosts case. This should agree\nwith the bosonic case due to the simple relation between the three-vertices in these two\ncases (3.20). This is so, since the space H\u03baghost\n, which is the twisted ghost analogue of H\u03ba2 ,\n2\nis defined using the transformation [21],\nb\u03ba =\n\n\u221e\nX\nv\u03ba\n\u221an bn ,\nn\nn=1\n\nc\u03ba =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221a\nvn\u03ba ncn ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere vn\u03ba are the normalized transformation coefficients from the discrete to the continuous\nbasis [19]. As this transformation is the same as the matter one, exactly up to factors of\nE, E \u22121 , we can use (3.20) to deduce that a surface state defined by a given conformal map\n. Moreover, with the proper\nhas its matter part in H\u03ba2 iff its twisted ghost part is in H\u03baghost\n2\ndefinitions, s2 (\u03ba), s13 (\u03ba) are the same in both cases.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fHere we further investigate surface states in H\u03ba2 . We simplify the criterion and solve\nit completely. We then prove that\nH\u03ba \u2229 H\u03a3 =HW ,\n\nH\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 =HBW .\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\nWe start this section by simplifying the criterion of [17] in 5.1. This will enable us to\nget the full solution of the problem. First, in 5.2 we find all twist invariant states of\nthe subalgebra. These are the wedge states and the twist invariant butterflies, which do\nnot form a subalgebra by themselves. Then, in 5.3 we detour to the issue of PSL(2, R)\ninvariance of the solutions, which we will use in 5.4 to find all possible states and conclude\nthe proof.\n5.1 Simplifying the surface state condition\nFirst, we want to simplify the condition for a surface state to be in H\u03ba2 . This condition is\ngiven in (3.40) of [17],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf (z) \u2212 f (w)\n\u2738\u2737 log\n= 0,\n(5.6)\nz\u2212w\n\nwhere\n\nd2\nd2\n\u2212\n,\ndu2 dv 2\nu = tan\u22121 (z) ,\n\n\u2737=\n\nd2\n,\ndu dv\nv = tan\u22121 (w) ,\n\n\u2738=\n\n(5.7)\n(5.8)\n\nand we redefined z, w \u2192 \u2212z, \u2212w to avoid cumbersome minus signs. This expression can\nbe rewritten more explicitly as\n\u0012\n\u0010 f \u2032 (z)f \u2032 (w)\n\u0011\u0013\n1\n2\n2\n\u2737 (1 + z )(1 + w )\n\u2212\n= 0.\n(5.9)\n(f (z) \u2212 f (w))2 (z \u2212 w)2\nUsing the explicit form of the d'Alembertian\n\u2737 = (1 + z 2 )\u2202z (1 + z 2 )\u2202z \u2212 (1 + w2 )\u2202w (1 + w2 )\u2202w ,\nthe condition becomes\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u2202z (1 + z 2 )\u2202z (1 + z 2 ) \u2212 \u2202w (1 + w2 )\u2202w (1 + w2 )\nIntegrating this equation\n\nRz\n0\n\ndz\n\nRw\n0\n\n(5.10)\n\n\u0011\nf \u2032 (z)f \u2032 (w)\n1\n\u2212\n= 0 . (5.11)\n(f (z) \u2212 f (w))2 (z \u2212 w)2\n\ndw, with the initial conditions (2.5), gives\n\n\u0010 f (z) \u2212 f (w) z \u0011\n1\n1\n+ 2\u2212\n=\nz\u2212w\nf (z)\nz\nf (z)2\n\u0010 f (w) \u2212 f (z) w \u0011\n1\n1\n+ 2\u2212\n.\n(1 + w2 )\u2202w (1 + w2 )\u2202w log\nw\u2212z\nf (w)\nw\nf (w)2\n(1 + z 2 )\u2202z (1 + z 2 )\u2202z log\n\n(5.12)\n\nThis expression is already simpler than our starting point, as it has only second derivatives\nas opposed to the four initial ones. However, we can improve it further. To that end\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fwe expand it with respect to w around w = 0, again taking (2.5) into account. The\nfirst non-vanishing term is the coefficient of w. It gives a necessary condition, which is a\nsecond order differential equation with respect to z. Isolating f \u2032\u2032 (z), we get the not-tooilluminating expression,\nf \u2032\u2032 (z) =\n2\n\n6(2 + 2(z + z 3 )f (z)f \u2032 (z) \u2212 2(1 + z 2 ) f \u2032 (z)2 + f (z)2 (2 + f (3) (0))) + f (z)3 f (4) (0)\n6(1 +\n\nz 2 )2 f (z)\n\n.\n\n(5.13)\n\nWhile this is already an ordinary differential equation, it is a complicated non-linear one,\nand we do not know how to solve it directly. Instead, we now re-expand (5.12), this time\nsubstituting (5.13) for f \u2032\u2032 (w) and f \u2032\u2032 (z). The first non-vanishing term now is the coefficient\nof w3 , and it gives a simple first order differential equation,\n\nwhere we defined\nc2 = 2 + f (3) (0) ,\n\np\ndf\n= (1 + z 2 )f \u2032 (z) = 1 + c2 f 2 + c3 f 3 + c4 f 4 ,\ndu\n1\nc3 = f (4) (0) ,\n3\n\n(5.14)\n\n4\nf (5) (0) \u2212 f (3) (0)2\nc4 = 1 + f (3) (0) +\n, (5.15)\n3\n12\n\nand derivatives are with respect to z. It may seem that this equation is not well defined,\nsince as a first order equation it should depend only on one initial condition, while we have\nthree initial conditions in (2.5) and three others in the definition of the constants (5.15).\nHowever, a direct inspection shows that the equation, together with the single initial condition f (0) = 0, imply the other five.\nSo far we only proved that this equation is a necessary condition for (5.12). Strangely\nenough, when we substitute (5.14) back into (5.12), we see that it automatically holds.\nEq. (5.14) is therefore also a sufficient condition. We arrived at a simple criterion for a\nsurface state to be in H\u03ba2 . The defining conformal map should be a solution of a first\norder differential equation in one variable with three free parameters c2 , c3 , c4 . These\nparameters should be real so that the coordinate patch is well defined. If there were no\nfurther restrictions on possible values for the initial conditions f (3) (0), f (4) (0), f (5) (0), then\nc2 , c3 , c4 could have gotten any value. We examine restrictions on these parameters and\nsolutions of the equation for the simple case of twist invariant states in 5.2. Next, we\nexamine the way that (5.14) generalizes when we relax the initial conditions (2.5) in 5.3.\nThis will enable us to give the general solution in 5.4.\nWe end this subsection by comparing our results to eq. (5.16) of [27], which we reproduce here,\n1 \u2212 f \u2032 (u + v) 1 + f \u2032 (u \u2212 v)\nf \u2032 (u)f \u2032 (v)\n=\n\u2212\n.\n(5.16)\n\u2212\n(f (u) \u2212 f (v))2\n2f (u + v)2\n2f (u \u2212 v)2\n\nThis is another refined version of (5.6). Here, derivatives are with respect to the u, v\nvariables (5.8) and not the z, w ones as in our refined expression (5.12). The initial conditions (2.5) take the same form with respect to u as with respect to z. Higher derivatives are\ndifferent. We expand (5.16) to the second order around v = 0. That gives us an expression\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\ffor f (3) (u) in terms of lower derivatives. Inserting this condition (and its derivatives) back\ninto (5.16), which we expand now to the third order, gives an expression for f \u2032\u2032 (u) from\nwhich the previous one can be derived. Repeating the procedure once more, we get from\nthe coefficient of v 4 the condition (5.14), with\nc2 = f (3) (0) ,\n\nc3 =\n\n1 (4)\nf (0) ,\n3\n\nc4 =\n\nf (5) (0) \u2212 f (3) (0)2\n.\n12\n\n(5.17)\n\nThe reason that these conditions seem different from (5.15) is that here the derivatives\nare with respect to u, while previously they were given with respect to z. In fact, these\nconditions coincide. Due to the dependence on u\u00b1 v in (5.16) this equation is not automatically satisfied upon inserting (5.14). Rather, we get a functional identity, which should\nbe satisfied by all the solutions of (5.14), if this equation is to be a necessary condition in\nthis case as well. Using the general solution (5.46), found below, and identities of Jacobi\nfunctions, we were able to prove that this is indeed the case for all twist invariant solutions.\nThe proof, however, is quite messy, and will not be reproduced here. For the general case,\nthe expressions we get are even more ugly, and we didn't manage to complete the proof.\nInstead, we were contempt by checking the conditions numerically for various parameter\nvalues, and expanding (5.16) up to v 16 without the emergence of any new restrictions.\nIt should be noted that the condition (5.16) was derived not for the matter sector\nof the twisted ghost system. However, we asserted above that the\nH\u03ba2 , but for H\u03baghost\n2\nconditions in this two cases are the same. Thus, the above calculation gives the expected\nresult and serves as a verification of the mutual consistency of our calculations and those\nof [27, 30, 21].\n5.2 Twist-invariant solutions\nWe now examine the case of the twist invariant solutions of (5.14). Note that this is not a\nstar-subalgebra. For twist invariant solutions f is anti-symmetric and thus we should set\nc3 = 0. In this case the r.h.s of (5.14) becomes an even function of f (z) and the solution\nis indeed an odd function of z, i.e., a twist invariant one. Next, we write the equation in\nterms of u as,\ndf \u00012\n+ (\u2212c2 f 2 \u2212 c4 f 4 ) = 1 .\n(5.18)\ndu\n\nThis is the energy equation of an anharmonic oscillator, with m = 2, \u03c9 2 = \u2212c2 and energy\nE = 1. The role of time is played by u, and the anharmonicity is described by c4 . For\nc2 < 0 and c4 = 0 this is the harmonic oscillator, while for c2 , c4 < 0 we get the Duffing\noscillator.\nTo gain more from the oscillator analogy we use the new variable and function\nt \u2261 iu ,\n\ng \u2261 if ,\n\n(5.19)\n\nso as to remain with the initial condition \u0121(0) = 1. The energy equation now is\n\u0121 2 + (c2 g2 \u2212 c4 g4 ) = 1 ,\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n(5.20)\n\n\fThe general solution of this equation is given by the elliptic function\n1\ng = sn(kt|m) ,\nk\n\nc2\nm = 2 \u2212 1,\nk\n\nk=\n\ns\n\nc2\n+\n2\n\nr\n\nc2 \u00012\n\u2212 c4 .\n2\n\n(5.21)\n\nWhile the solution formally exists for almost all values of the parameters, we should\nkeep in mind that the resulting f should be a permissible conformal map. We know that\nthe region |R(u)| \u2264 \u03c04 , I(u) \u2265 0 describes the local coordinate patch. As such, the solution\nin this region should be injective to a domain in the upper half plane. In particular,\nsingularities are allowed only at the boundary of the strip. In the t coordinate this strip is\ndescribed by |I(t)| \u2264 \u03c04 , R(t) \u2265 0. For g to be injective on the positive real line, we need\nthat the \"particle\" will not get to a reflection point, that is, we should not allow for cases\nlike a, b, c of fig. 2. In particular, we should demand c4 \u2265 0. The case d, in which c4 > 0\nand there is no potential barrier for the particle, should not be allowed either, as in this\ncase the particle reaches infinity at a finite time. The only allowed case with c4 > 0 is e,\nas it takes infinite time to reach the maximum point. For c4 = 0 we should have c2 \u2264 0\nto avoid case a. We can allow c2 < 0, case f , as it takes infinite time to get to infinity for\nthe inverted harmonic potential. We conclude that only the two classes e, f are allowed\nsolutions.\na\n\nb\n\nc\n1\n\n1\n1\n\nd\n1\n\ne\n\nf\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Various possible \"potentials\". Cases for which infinity or a deflection point is reached\nin finite time, should be disregarded.\n\n\u221a\nIn case e, c2 = 2 c4 , and the equation is\n\u0121 = 1 \u2212\n\n2 \u00012 2\ng ,\nn\n\n2\n.\nn\u2261 \u221a\n4 c\n4\n\n(5.22)\n\nThe solution in terms of f is the wedge state |ni (4.16). For this state to be single valued\nin the whole strip around the positive real axis, we should further require the usual domain\nrestriction (4.15).\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fFor case f the equation is\n\u0121 =\n\np\n\n\u03b12 \u2261 \u2212c2 .\n\n1 + \u03b12 g2 ,\n\n(5.23)\n\nThe solution in terms of f is the butterfly (4.1). Requiring injectivity in the half-infinite\nstrip around the real axis introduces here the usual constraint (4.2).\nWe see that there are no other new surface states in the twist invariant subclass of H\u03ba2 .\nIn particular, the only twist invariant surface state projectors in H\u03ba2 are the butterflies\nand the identity (the wedge state with n = 1), while the only twist invariant surface states\nin H\u03ba are the wedge states. In fact, all states in H\u03ba are twist invariant. Thus,\nH\u03ba \u2229 H\u03a3 = HW .\n\n(5.24)\n\nOne may still wonder what goes wrong when we take a non-permissible conformal\nmapf . The answer can be seen by inspecting the butterfly wave function in the continuous\nbasis, eq. (3.58) of [17]. An \"illegal\" value of \u03b1 here will result in an inverted gaussian\nfor the wave function. We believe that this is the general case. It was noticed in [40, 41],\nthat the star-algebra of squeezed states can be enlarged to give a monoid structure, so\nas to allow the inclusion of inverted gaussians. We see that surface states in this formal\ndescription do not possess a well defined local coordinate patch.\n5.3 PSL(2, R) covariant differential equations\nSurface states are defined as bra-states by the expectation value of operator insertions on\nthe given surface, which is topologically a disk. It is customary to use the upper half\nplane as a canonical disk. This is possible due to Riemann's theorem. Surface states are\ndistinguished in this representation by the image under the conformal map f of the local\ncoordinate patch, which is the upper half unit disk. This map sends the local coordinate\npatch into the upper half plane. The boundary of the local coordinate patch is a curve in\nthe upper half plane, with the image of the real segment I(z) = 0, |z| < 1 lying on the\nboundary of the upper half plane [14, 37, 42, 26].\nIn general, the state is invariant under a PSL(2, C) (M\u00f6bius) transformation of the\nconformal map f . But since we use a canonical representation for the disk, we are left\nonly with a PSL(2, R) invariance. Up to this point, the PSL(2, R) ambiguity was fixed by\nimposing the conditions (2.5) on the map f . In this subsection we want to relax these\nconditions. This will help us in solving the general case in 5.4, revealing an interesting\nmathematical structure on the way.\nWe start by considering the PSL(2, R) transformation,\naf + b\n,\nf \u0303 =\ncf + d\n\nad \u2212 bc = 1 ,\n\n(5.25)\n\nwhich has three independent real parameters. In terms of f \u0303 the l.h.s. of (5.14) reads\ndf \u0303\n1\ndf\n=\n,\ndu\n(cf \u0303 \u2212 a)2 du\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(5.26)\n\n\fwhile the r.h.s is\np\nc4 (f \u2212 f1 )(f \u2212 f2 )(f \u2212 f3 )(f \u2212 f4 ) =\ns\n\u0010 b \u2212 df \u0303\n\u0011\u0010 b \u2212 df \u0303\n\u0011\u0010 b \u2212 df \u0303\n\u0011\u0010 b \u2212 df \u0303\n\u0011\nc4\n\u2212 f1\n\u2212 f2\n\u2212 f3\n\u2212 f4 .\ncf \u0303 \u2212 a\ncf \u0303 \u2212 a\ncf \u0303 \u2212 a\ncf \u0303 \u2212 a\n\n(5.27)\n\nHere we wrote the polynomial inside the square root using its roots, assuming the conditions\nY\n1\n(\u2212fi ) =\n,\nc4\ni\nX\nfi\u22121 = 0 .\n\n(5.28)\n(5.29)\n\ni\n\nThis representation seems singular for the case of a polynomial of degree less than four,\nbut we will shortly see that the general case is also covered (the minus sign in (5.28) is\nimmaterial when the degree of the polynomial is even). In the general case c4 should be\nreplaced by the coefficient of the highest non-vanishing power of f . The reality of the\ncoefficients of (5.14) implies that the roots fi are either positive, or complex conjugate\npaired.\nWe now move (cf \u0303 \u2212 a)2 inside the root and get,\nv\nu 4\nu Y\n \u0303\ndf\n= tc4\n(cfi + d)(f \u0303 \u2212 f \u0303i ) ,\n(5.30)\ndu\ni=1\n\nwhere fi were transformed to f \u0303i using (5.25). We did not use the initial conditions (2.5)\nto get to this expression. The equation is to be supplemented with the initial condition\nb\naf (0) + b\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 .\nf \u0303(0) =\ncf (0) + d f (0)\u21920 d\n\n(5.31)\n\nWe also see that when one of the roots goes to infinity, say f \u03031 = \u221e, then the prefactor\ncfi + d exactly cancels the divergence, and the polynomial reduces to a cubic polynomial,\nor to a polynomial of a lower degree in the case of a multiple root. Given a polynomial\nof degree less than four, we can transform it to a quartic polynomial. The point which\nreturns from infinity contributes a factor of (a \u2212 cf \u0303) to the power of its multiplicity. The\nform of (5.14) after a PSL(2, R) transformation is\np\ndf\n= P4 (f ) ,\ndu\n\nP4 (f ) =\n\n4\nX\n\nci f i ,\n\n(5.32)\n\ni=0\n\nwith some initial condition f (0). It is possible that some of the coefficients vanish.\nAn initial condition together with a differential equation of the form (5.32), is equivalent to a complex function, which is a conformal transformation in our case. These functions\ntransform covariantly with respect to PSL(2, R). The set of permissible functions of this\ntype modulo PSL(2, R) forms the H\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 star-subalgebra. We want to know what are\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fthe restrictions on a real quartic polynomial together with an initial condition in order\nto be a permissible state in this subalgebra. There is no loss of generality by assuming\nthat the polynomial is quartic. We solve this problem by transforming the polynomial to\nits canonical form (5.28, 5.29), while the initial condition goes to f (0) = 0, by composing\nthree simple transformations,\nf \u2192 f \u2212 f (0) ,\nf\n\u0001 ,\nf\u2192\n1 P \u22121\n1 \u2212 4 i fi f\n\n(5.33)\n\nf \u2192 cf .\n\nThe first of these transformations takes care of the initial condition. The second one takes\ncare of (5.29). Note that there is no need to find the roots of the polynomial since\nX\nc1\nfi\u22121 = \u2212 .\n(5.34)\nc0\ni\n\nThe third transformation is a rescaling that fixes (5.28). Since in PSL(2, R) there are only\npositive rescalings, this transformation cannot always be preformed. In particular, the case\nwhere f (0) = fi for some i, should be excluded. Inspecting the first two transformations,\nwe see that the sign of the constant term is the same as the sign of the original polynomial\nevaluated at f (0). Thus, we conclude that a polynomial P (f ), with the initial condition\nf (0), define a permissible function iff\n\u0001\nP f (0) > 0 .\n(5.35)\n5.4 The general solution\n\nHere we want to consider the case where the polynomial in the original PSL(2) form\nhas c3 6= 0 in (5.14). We cannot use the simple analysis of 5.2, since in this case we\nget a complex \"potential energy\". Instead, we start by suggesting some intuition using\nthe similarity of (5.32) to Seiberg-Witten curves [43], after which we use the PSL(2, R)\ninvariance to transform the equation to a simpler form and analyze each possible case\nexplicitly. We know apriori that in the twisted sector we should find the hybrid butterflies\nof section 4. What we will find in the general analysis is that they are the only permissible\nstates in this sector. Thus, we conclude that the subalgebra of H\u03ba2 surface states consists\nof the wedge states and the butterflies.\nIn order to decide which functions are in the subalgebra, we should impose the restriction of injectivity of the local coordinate patch. Let us define\ny=\n\ndf\n,\ndu\n\nx=f.\n\n(5.36)\n\nWe can rewrite (5.32) as\ny 2 = P4 (x) ,\n\n(5.37)\n\nwhich is the elliptic equation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. There are some differences of\ncourse. We have PSL(2, R) rather than PSL(2, Z) acting on our space and our surfaces\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fhave boundaries. However, these differences are irrelevant for the analysis below. The\ntopology of the Seiberg-Witten curve is that of a torus, with\nR dx\n\u03b1 y\ndx\n\u03b2 y\n\n\u03c4=R\n\nIn our case\n\n.\n\ndx\n= du .\ny\n\n(5.38)\n\n(5.39)\n\nTherefore, going around a cut in the curve corresponds to a constant change of u. As a\nresult f (u) is doubly periodic in the u plane unless a cycle collapses. But this happens\nexactly when two roots, or more, coincide. Thus, it is enough to consider only these cases.\nWe see that we should distinguish the possible polynomials according to the multiplicity\nof their roots. The most generic case is when all roots are distinct. We know already that\nthis case does not contribute. We shall, nevertheless, analyze this case explicitly in 5.4.1,\nwhere we show that PSL(2, R) can be used to get a polynomial with only even powers, and\na given initial condition. The next case is when we have a double root. If the two other\nroots are distinct, we can transform the double root to infinity and the two other roots to\neither \u00b11 or \u00b1i, depending whether these roots are real or not. This gives a polynomial\nwith only constant and quadratic terms. If there are two double roots, we can transform\nthe two couples to either \u00b11 or \u00b1i, which gives again a polynomial with only even powers.\nThe double root case would therefore be considered together with the case when all roots\nare distinct in 5.4.1, where we verify that the distinct-roots case indeed does not contribute,\nand find all the legitimate solutions to the even-power polynomials.\nNext there is the case of a triple root, which we study in 5.4.2. In the last case, where\nall roots are the same, we can send them to infinity while leaving the initial condition\ninvariant and rescale the constant to unity. We get the equation\ndf\n= 1,\ndu\n\nf (0) = 0 ,\n\n(5.40)\n\nwhose solution\nf = u = tan\u22121 (z) ,\n\n(5.41)\n\nis the sliver.\n5.4.1 The even-power polynomials\nMost of the degree-four polynomials can be transformed using PSL(2, R) to the form\nP4 (f ) = 1 + c2 f 2 + c4 f 4 .\n\n(5.42)\n\nTo show this assertion in the case of four distinct roots, we distinguish three possible cases:\n1. Four real roots.\n2. Two real and two complex conjugate roots.\n3. Two pairs of complex conjugate roots.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fIn the first case we can always bring the four roots to \u00b11, x1 > 1, \u2212x2 < \u22121, while\nkeeping the initial condition f (0) = 0. We now want to PSL(2, R) transform the polynomial, to make it symmetric around f = 0 at the price of giving up f (0) = 0. To that end,\nwe transform it while fixing the points at \u00b11 and sending the two other points to \u00b1x for\nsome x > 1. Requiring that such a transformation leaves f (0) in the range |f (0)| < 1 fixes\nthe transformation completely. We use the cross ratio to find that\np\n1 + x1 x2 + (x21 \u2212 1)(x22 \u2212 1)\n,\n(5.43)\nx=\nx1 + x2\nf +k\nf\u2192\n,\n(5.44)\nkf + 1\np\n\u22121 + x1 x2 \u2212 (x21 \u2212 1)(x22 \u2212 1)\n.\n(5.45)\nk=\nx1 \u2212 x2\nOne can see that |k| < 1 and so the transformation is regular and obeys all the desired\nconditions. A rescaling of the polynomial brings it now to the form (5.42). Note, however,\nthat even in this form we cannot use the simple analysis of 5.2, because the initial condition\nf (0) 6= 0 becomes imaginary after the substitution (5.19).\nIn the second case the two real roots can be moved to \u00b11, while keeping f (0) = 0.\nNow the transformation should again leave the \u00b11 points invariant, while sending the two\nconjugate points to \u00b1ix and leaving |f (0)| < 1. The cross ratio determines now the value\nof x and then another expression for k (5.45). Again, rescaling brings us to the desired\nform. Similarly, for two couples of two complex conjugate roots, we use the cross ratio to\nfind a value of \u03b8, such that one pair is transformed to e\u00b1i\u03b8 , while the other is transformed\nto \u2212e\u2213i\u03b8 . Thus, all three cases are covered.\nAs pointed above, the case of a double root also corresponds to a polynomial of the\nform (5.42). We now turn to solve the differential equation for this case. The problem\ndiffers from the twist invariant case only by the initial condition. Consequently, the general\nsolution in this case also differs by an initial condition constant from (5.21),\ns\nr\n\u0001\nc2\nc2 \u00012\nc2\n1\nm = \u2212 2 \u2212 1,\nk= \u2212 +\n\u2212 c4 .\n(5.46)\nf = sn k(u \u2212 u0 )|m ,\nk\nk\n2\n2\nHowever, this function is doubly periodic in the complex plane,\n\u03c9 = 4K(m) ,\n\n\u03c9 \u2032 = 2iK(1 \u2212 m) ,\n\n(5.47)\n\nwhere K(m) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. As such, this function cannot\nbe single valued in the half-infinite strip, unless one of the cycles diverges, or if the ratio\nK(m)\nK(1\u2212m) is imaginary, which happens only in the limit m \u2192 \u221e. We should also check the\nlimit k \u2192 0, but this gives again the case m \u2192 \u221e. The function K(m) has a branch\ncut, which goes from m = 1 to infinity. The branch cut itself does not pose a problem,\nas different values for K(m), K(1 \u2212 m) correspond to different but equivalent choices of\nlattice vectors. We are interested in the point m = 1 itself, as this is the only point where\nK(m) diverges. Since the periods are proportional to K(m), K(1 \u2212 m), the only possible\npoints for a permissible conformal map are m = 0, 1, \u221e.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fThe restriction m = 0 implies,\nc2\n+\n2\n\nr\n\nc2 \u00012\n\u2212 c4 = 0 .\n2\n\n(5.48)\n\nThe only solution is c4 = 0, c2 < 0 that corresponds to a double root. In this case (5.46)\nreduces to\np\nsin( |c2 |u + \u03c6)\np\n,\n(5.49)\nf (u) =\n|c2 |\n\nwhere \u03c6 is fixed by the initial condition. We recognize (4.9), which means that in this case\nthe solutions are the hybrid butterflies. For m \u2192 \u221e, we should demand c4 = 0, c2 > 0.\nNow, sin \u2192 sinh, the function is not single valued in the strip, and so this case should be\nexcluded.\nWhen m = 1 we get\nc2 \u00012\n= c4 .\n(5.50)\n2\nThis corresponds to two double roots. The solution now is\nf (u) =\n\ntan(\n\n\u221a\n\nc2\nu\n2\n\u221a\nc2\n2\n\n+ \u03c6)\n\n.\n\n(5.51)\n\nFor c2 < 0 the tan \u2192 tanh and again this case can be excluded as it is not single valued.\nWhen c2 > 0 we can PSL(2, R) transform the solution to the case \u03c6 = 0. That is, we get\nonly the twist invariant wedge states in this case.\n5.4.2 The case of three identical roots\nWe choose a conformal transformation that maps the triple root to infinity and the initial\ncondition to f (0) = 0, while scaling the constant to unity. Thus, we get the equation\n\nThe solution is\n\np\ndf\n= 1 + c1 f .\ndu\n\n(5.52)\n\nc1 2\nu .\n(5.53)\n4\nWe recognize a PSL(2, R) transformed (4.13). Thus, these solutions are hybrid slivers.\nWe exhausted all possibilities and found no new states in the subalgebra. We can\nconclude that indeed,\n(5.54)\nHBW = H\u03ba2 \u2229 H\u03a3 .\nf =u+\n\n6. Other surface state subalgebras\nThe fact that a surface state is defined only up to a PSL(2, R) transformation implies that\nany star-subalgebra of surface states should form a PSL(2, R) invariant subspace. With\nthis observation we turn to find PSL(2, R) invariant subspaces based on generalizations\nof (5.32). In this section, we find in this way an infinite number of surface state subalgebras\nand explain their geometric interpretation.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fFrom the way (5.32) was constructed we see that it can be naturally generalized to\n\u00012\ndf\n= Pn (f ) n ,\ndu\n\nn \u2208 N,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere Pn (f ) stands for a real polynomial of degree n at most and the equation is supplemented by an initial condition on f (0) such that (5.35) holds. The set of solutions of this\nequation for a given n forms a PSL(2, R) invariant subspace. We want to examine whether\nthis space modulo PSL(2, R) also forms a star-subalgebra. Indeed the answer to this question is affirmative. As in the case of n = 4 analyzed above, what we should consider is not\nthe whole invariant subspace, but its subset of permissible conformal maps.\nBefore we look at the general case we want to check the simplest examples. For n = 1\nthe equation is immediately solved. There is only one solution, which up to PSL(2, R) is\nf = u, that is the sliver. This definitely forms a subalgebra as the sliver is a projector. The\nn = 2 case is not much harder. We can see that the solutions are just the wedge states,\nagain a subalgebra. The n = 3 case already gives beta functions in the general solution.\nHowever, it would become evident that the only permissible solution is again the sliver.\nThe n = 4 case was the subject of section 5, where we showed that it gives the subalgebra\nHBW .\nFrom checking the simplest cases it seems that the invariant subspaces indeed form\nsubalgebras, which we shall label Hn . We prove below that all the Hn are subalgebras. We\nalso notice that H1 \u2282 H2 \u2282 H4 . It can be seen from (6.1) that this is a part of a general\nscheme,\nn|m \u21d2 Hn \u2282 Hm .\n\n(6.2)\n\nThat is, an element of Hn is also a member of Hm whenever m is an integer multiple of n.\nFrom here we see that we can define yet another subalgebra\nH\u221e \u2261\n\n[\n\nn\u2208N\n\nHn .\n\n(6.3)\n\nThis is a subalgebra because an element of H\u221e is necessarily an element of Hn for some\nn. Two arbitrary elements of H\u221e , say \u03c61 \u2208 Hn and \u03c62 \u2208 Hm , are both in Hnm and so is\ntheir product,\n(\u03c61 \u22c6 \u03c62 ) \u2208 Hnm \u2282 H\u221e .\n\n(6.4)\n\nTo understand the nature of these subalgebras we recall that the function f represents\na mapping from a domain in the u plane to the upper half f plane. The mapping does\nnot have to be injective, except for the local coordinate patch, but as it represents a disk\nit should be onto, and an inverse mapping should exist. The inverse mapping does not\nhave to be injective either, as it may happen that u is not an adequate global coordinate\nfor the disk. In this case the original mapping is formally multivalued and is single valued\nfrom some cover of the u plane domain to f . This cover should include a copy of the local\ncoordinate patch and map bijectively to the f plane. We also remark that generally the\nmap is not restricted to the upper half u plane.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fWe consider the inverse map from f to u. According to (6.1) this map obeys\nu = u0 + c\n\nZ\n\nf\n0\n\n\u0011\u2212 2\n\u0010\nn\ndf (f \u2212 f1 )k1 ...(f \u2212 fm )km\n,\n\nk\u2261\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\nki \u2264 n .\n\n(6.5)\n\nUsing PSL(2, R) we can put the mapping into the standard form (2.5). For the map from\nf to u these conditions can be written as\nu(0) = u\u2032\u2032 (0) = 0 ,\nthat is\nu0 = 0 ,\n\nu\u2032 (0) = 1 ,\nm\n\u0010Y\n\nm\n\u00112\n\u0010Y\nki n\n,\n(\u2212fi )\nc=\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nso that\nPn (f ) =\n\nm \u0010\nY\ni=1\n\n1\u2212\n\nfiki\n\n(6.6)\n\nm\n\u0011\u0010 X\n1 \u0011\n= 0,\nkj fj\n\n(6.7)\n\nj=1\n\nf \u0011ki\n= 1 + c2 f 2 + ... + ck f k ,\nfi\n\n(6.8)\n\nas in the P4 case.\nThe roots of a real polynomial are either real or complex paired. In 6.1 we analyze\nthe case when all the roots are real. We show that these states are all projectors. We\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nalso prove that these projectors form subalgebras, which we call Hn , with H1 = H2\n(0)\ncontaining only the sliver and H4 = HB . Next, in 6.2 we analyze the general case, where\n(0)\nwe show that the Hn are also subalgebras. The Hn extend the previous ones, Hn \u2282 Hn\nand contain surface states with conical singularities. The proof of the subalgebra property\nis non-trivial in this case and is completed in the appendix.\n6.1 The Schwarz-Christoffel states\nIn the real root case the expression (6.5) can be identified as a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping [44]. The image of the real f axis, which is the disk boundary, is therefore a polygon.\nThe vertices of the polygon are the images of the roots fi . We refer to a root also as a\nprevertex. The turning angle at the ith vertex is set by the multiplicity ki of the prevertex\nas\nki\n(6.9)\n\u03b2i \u03c0 = 2\u03c0 ,\nn\nand the interior angle \u03b1i \u03c0 between two lines which meet at the vertex is given by\n\u03b1i = 1 \u2212 \u03b2i = 1 \u2212 2\n\nki\n.\nn\n\n(6.10)\n\nWe see that when k = n the total turning angle of the polygon is 2\u03c0. Otherwise the missing\nangle is at infinity. We also see that \u03b2i > 0. Thus, the polygon is convex.\nWhen the multiplicity of a root obeys\nki \u2265\n\nn\n2\n\n(6.11)\n\nthe image of the root is u(fi ) = \u221e, whether fi is finite on infinite, as can be seen from (6.5).\nWe have to allow for at least one such prevertex, as otherwise the f plane would be mapped\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fto a bounded polygon, and in particular its image would not include the local coordinate\npatch. Suppose now that there are two such prevertices. This is possible only for even n\nand then we get the tanh(cu) solution, which was discarded in section 5, because it is not\nsingle valued. Therefore, there must be a single prevertex of this type.\n(0)\nWe conclude that the general form of a state in Hn is similar to the example shown\nin fig. 3. Conversely, given a region bounded by a polygon in the upper half u plane,\nwhich includes the local coordinate patch and with all turning angles equal to an integer\n(0)\nmultiple of 2\u03c0\nn for some n, there is a state in Hn which corresponds to this region. This is\nso because it is always possible to find a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping to this region, with\nadequate powers for the prevertices [44]. Note that for these states a subspace of the upper\nu plane serves as a global coordinate. The local coordinate patch separates the left and\nright sides of these states, which are therefore rank one projectors, as stated.\n\n\u03a0\n- \u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n(0)\n\nFigure 3: The u plane representation of a generic state in H12 . The local coordinate patch is\nin grey. All turning angles \u03b2i \u03c0 are integer multiples of \u03c06 . At infinity \u03b21 = 76 . From there in\nanticlockwise direction \u03b22,3,4 = 61 and \u03b25 = 13 .\n\n6.2 Generalized Schwarz-Christoffel states\nSuppose now that there exist at least a single, presumably multiple, complex pair. The\nsimplest case, in which the roots have maximal possible multiplicity n2 , is possible only for\nan even n. In this case (6.5) reduces to\nZ\nu = c df (f \u2212 f1 )\u22121 (f \u2212 f \u03041 )\u22121 ,\n(6.12)\nwhich gives the wedge states as solutions. We see that the root f1 introduces a logarithmic\nsingularity in the f plane. A cut should be introduced in the f plane and both sides of\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fthis cut transform to different lines in the u plane. In order to remain with a disk topology\nthese two lines in the u plane should be identified and, as a result, the point\nu(f1 ) = \u221e ,\n\n(6.13)\n\nwhich is the string mid-point, develops a conical singularity. This conical singularity carries\nalso to the z plane, except for the vacuum state n = 2. That the conical singularity differs\nin the z, u coordinates can be traced again to the essential singularity of the map (4.3) for\nz = i.\nThis conical singularity is best described in the \u0175 plane of [37], where it is seen that\nthe state |ni has an excess angle of (n \u2212 2)\u03c0, in a representation where the local coordinate\npatch takes a canonical (up to PSL(2, C)) form. Due to (6.13) the two identified lines are\nin different sides of the local coordinate patch and there is no left-right separation due to\nthe identification. Indeed, the wedge states are generally not projectors.\nIn the general case, when the multiplicity of a complex root is less than n2 , the image\nof the root is a finite point in the u plane. To have a non-bounded polygon in this case,\nwe need to demand, as in the real-root case, that there exists a prevertex obeying (6.11).\nAlso, in this case the identified curves are located on the same side of the local coordinate\npatch. There is a left-right factorization for these states and so they are projectors. Thus,\nthe only non-projectors in H\u221e are the wedge states.\nThe addition of complex conjugate root pairs does not change the validity of the\nSchwarz-Christoffel construction since on the real f axis such a pair contributes a factor of\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2212 2ki \u0011\n\u2206 arg u\u2032 (f ) = arg (f \u2212 fi )(f \u2212 f \u0304i ) n = 0 .\n\n(6.14)\n\nThis equality stems from the positivity of the factor inside the parentheses.\nNote that the introduction of real prevertices, which we did not have for the wedge\nstates, may result in a curved image of a straight cut. However, the angle between the\nimages of the two sides of the cut is constant along the cut and equals\n\u03b3i \u03c0 = 4\u03c0\n\nki\n.\nn\n\n(6.15)\n\nThe angle at infinity is reduced by this amount. It should be possible to pick up a curved\nline in the f plane as the cut, in such a way that the identified lines in the u plane are\nstraight and meet at the angle \u03b3i \u03c0. As these line segments should not touch neither the\nlocal coordinate patch nor the disk boundary, which is bounded by the real axis from below,\n\u03b3 > 12 is not allowed, and so states with complex roots exist only in Hn\u22658 .

These roots produce two couples of identified curves, separated by angles of 4\u03c0\n39 and\n8\u03c0\n6\u03c0\n39 , and one vertex, whose turning angle is 39 . The local coordinate patch is in grey.

In\norder to be a subalgebra we should demand the closure of this set under star-multiplication.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fIt would be enough to show that given a set of vertices in the u plane together with locations\nof conical singularities, such that all the angle restrictions discussed above hold for some\nn, it is possible to construct a polynomial Pn (f ) of the form (6.8).\nWe can refer to such a map as a \"generalized Schwarz-Christoffel\" mapping. In fact,\nthis kind of mappings were considered in the literature, although in a different context\nin [45]. It was noted there that these functions map to polygons with conical singularities.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, a proof of the completeness of generalized SchwarzChristoffel maps was never given before. We have to prove two things,\n\u2022 Given a convex polygon with prescribed conical singularities, there exists a conformal\nmap of a properly punctured upper half plane onto the polygon2 .\n\u2022 All such conformal maps are of the generalized Schwarz-Christoffel type.\nThe number of free parameters in this problem is correct, as in the usual Schwarz-Christoffel\ncase, but this fact by itself does not constitute a proof. Finding an analytical relation\nbetween the (cut) polygon and the polynomial coefficients would constitute a proof, but\nsuch a relation is not know even for the usual case. We give a detailed proof of these\nassertions, but since the proof is purely mathematical we defer it to the appendix.\nIt should be stressed that the map we have is indeed to a surface with a conical\nsingularity, and not to surfaces before gluing, as in figures 4, 5. Given a conical singularity\non a surface we describe it using surfaces with identifications. But there are many ways\nto draw the identified curves. A change in the form of the identified curves in the u\nplane, which follows by a compatible change of the cut in the f plane, does not change the\nconformal map. However, it is possible to change the identified curves in the u plane without\nmodifying the cut on the f plane. The new surface on the u plane before identification and\nthe upper half f plane minus the cut, both have disk topology, and as such are conformally\nequivalent. But these maps in general will not map the two sides of the f plane cut to\nequidistant points on the two u plane identified curves. As such their gluing will introduce\ndistortions in addition to the conical singularity. Given a cut there should exist a unique\nway to \"open the conical singularity\" in the u plane and vice versa. The generalized\nSchwarz-Christoffel map does not introduce such distortions.\nFrom a geometric point of view, the map is most properly described by avoiding the\ncuts altogether, and considering a map from the punctured upper half plane to a punctured\nsurface. We use this geometric description in the appendix.\n\n7. Conclusions\nIn this paper we dealt with several issues regarding surface states and star-subalgebras.\nFirst, we showed the equivalence of two surface state criteria and found some analogous\nghost sector criteria. Then, we described the surface states that have a simple representation in the continuous basis. We showed that the twist invariant states are wedge states and\npurebred butterflies and that the non-twist invariant states are hybrid butterflies. We also\n2\n\nThis is not apriori obvious, since the singularities prevent us from using Riemann's theorem.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\felaborated on the properties of the hybrid butterflies. We found that all these states are\ndescribed by a simple geometric picture and discussed generalizations, which enabled us to\nfind many other subalgebras. These subalgebras are built using the generalized SchwarzChristoffel map and contain states with conical singularities. A proof of the generalized\nSchwarz-Christoffel theorem can be found in the appendix.\nWe could define many more subalgebras using the states we described. For example,\nany set of rank one projectors, which have a common left or right part, forms a subalgebra.\nAs most of our states are projectors, we could have defined many such subalgebras. As\nanother example we note that (6.2) implies that both \u222an|m Hm and \u222am|n Hm for some given\nn are subalgebras. There are many other examples. What would be interesting, though, is\nto find subalgebras that are big enough for addressing a particular problem on the one hand\nand that have a simple realization of the star-product on the other hand. For example,\nthe star-product is realized in a very simple way on H4 , where the states are trivially\nmanipulated both in the CFT and in the operator language. These states are probably\nenough for describing VSFT multi-D-brane solutions [17]. These facts are what makes H4\nan interesting object. However, for the higher Hn neither do we know of a simple algebraic\ndescription of the multiplication rule (due to the complexity of the Schwarz-Christoffel\nparametric problem and the lack of a simple \u03ba-representation), nor do we know for which\nproblem it can be of help. It is not even clear if surface states, or simple generalizations\nthereof such as surface states with some ghost insertions [14, 46, 47, 48], are large enough\nfor the problem of finding analytic string field theory solutions.\nConical singularities contribute delta function curvature singularities [1, 49]. The\nbosonized ghost action implies that there are ghost insertions at such points, as noted\nfor string field theory vertices in [1]. It may be possible to simplify the star-product of\nstates with conical singularities by using these facts. Finding a simple representation of\nthe star-product for our spaces would promote their practical use. Another possible direction would be to characterize the subalgebras in terms of the tau-function using the tools\nof [18, 50, 51]. It is also possible to form star-subalgebras by using the Virasoro operators\nKn [26]. It would be interesting to check if our spaces can be related to these ones, or to\nother star-derivations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Ofer Aharony, Gidi Amir, Paul Biran, Ori Gurel-Gurevich, J\u00fcrg\nK\u00e4ppeli, Alon Marcus, Yaron Oz, Misha Sodin, Jacob Sonnenschein, Stefan Theisen and\nBarton Zwiebach for discussions.

Generalizing the Schwarz-Christoffel proof\nStandard proofs of the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, as the ones in [52, 45] are hard to generalize for the case with conical singularities, since they rely heavily on specific properties\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fof meromorphic functions. We therefore, provide an alternative proof in A.1, which uses\nonly topological arguments to prove that the naive parameter counting is indeed adequate.\nWe examine only our case of interest, namely the case with one vertex at infinity, and\nso, when we refer to a polygon we actually mean a polygon with one vertex at infinity.\nHowever, we do not limit the discussion to polygons with a well defined local coordinate\npatch. Then, in A.2, the proof is extended to the case of a generalized Schwarz-Christoffel\nmap with one vertex at infinity.\nA.1 The Schwarz-Christoffel map\nGiven the angles of the polygon, we know the exponents of the prevertices. All SchwarzChristoffel maps with the correct number of prevertices that have adequate exponents give\npolygons with the correct angles. What we want to prove is that all polygons with these\nangles may be described by such maps. The proof is by induction on the number of vertices.\nWe fix the PSL(2, R) freedom by looking for maps for which (6.5) reduces to\ni\u03b8\n\nu=e\n\nZ\n\nf\n\ndf\n0\n\n\u0013\nm \u0012\nY\n1 + |fi | \u03b2i\ni=1\n\nfi \u2212 f\n\n.\n\n(A.1)\n\nHere we set u0 = 0, which amounts to\nf (0) = 0 .\n\n(A.2)\n\nWe also set f (\u221e) = \u221e by demanding\nm\nX\n\n\u03b2i < 1 .\n\n(A.3)\n\ni=1\n\nWhile in the general case this inequality can be saturated, all polygons that saturate this\ninequality can be regarded as limits of polygons which do not3 . This limit procedure\nis well defined in both the f and u planes. Thus, there is no loss of generality in the\nassumption (A.3). The scale constant c of (6.5) was set in (A.1) in a particular way\nthat leaves out only a phase, which takes care of the polygon orientation. It is a matter\nof straightforward algebra to see that it is always possible to get to such a form with\na PSL(2, R) rescaling. In our case of interest we have \u03b2i = 2kni (all powers are rational\nand the angles are rational multiples of \u03c0). In fact, for our case \u03b8 is also known, since our\nassumption (A.2) also implies that the image of a neighborhood of the f plane origin should\nbe mapped to an open interval around the u plane origin in an orientation preserving way,\nthat is f \u2032 (0) > 0. We therefore deduce that\nX\n\u03b8=\u03c0\n\u03b2i .\n(A.4)\nfi <0\n\n3\n\nWith a definition of the limit given shortly, the singular polygon with a single \u03b2 = 1 vertex (in addition\nto the \u03b2 = 1 vertex at infinity) is an exception. However, it is clear how to represent it as a SchwarzChristoffel map, it is the tanh(cu) solution, which we discarded in section 5. It is not a polygon in a strict\nsense in any case, since the \"finite vertex\" is also at infinity.\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fOur proof is not restricted to H\u221e surfaces. The inclusion of polygons whose boundary\ndoes not include the origin is also straightforward.\nThe most natural decomposition of the space of polygons consists of subspaces of all\npolygons with a given number of vertices and with given turning angles in these vertices.\nThe vertices in such a subspace are naturally ordered, with the vertex at infinity as the\nfirst one. However, we find it easier to consider all subspaces with a given set of angles\ntogether, regardless of the order of vertices, other than the one at infinity. We also allow\nin such a space the merging of vertices. For example, we consider a polygon with a single\nangle of \u03b21 + \u03b22 as being part of the space of polygons with the two angles (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ). We\ncall this space U\u03b2~ , with \u03b2~ = (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ). Generally we have a natural embedding U\u03b2~a \u2192 U\u03b2~ ,\nb\nprovided the elements of \u03b2~b can be grouped into partitions of elements of \u03b2~a . Thus, the\ndecomposition we consider is not a disjoint one.\nThe set of Schwarz-Christoffel maps that map the upper half plane to polygons in\nU\u03b2~ is denoted by F\u03b2~ . This space is topologically Rm , where the ith component equals\nto fi in (A.1). In principle we should have divided this space by symmetry factors of\npermutation groups of equal angles. However, it is easier to pretend that these prevertices\nare distinguishable and at the same time distinguish equivalent vertices in the definition\nof U\u03b2~ . Proving the assertion for these covers of the correct spaces is enough, as any\nrepresentative for the conformal map in F\u03b2~ will do the job. Moreover, given two conformal\nmaps from the upper half plane to a given polygon, u1 (f ), u2 (f ), the composition u\u22121\n2 \u25e6 u1\nis a conformal map from the upper half plane to itself and so is in PSL(2, R), but since we\nalready fixed this ambiguity, this map is actually the identity map and we have u1 = u2 .\nThe topology of U\u03b2~ is also Rm . Here, the ith component, ui , equals to the oriented distance\nalong the boundary of the polygon from the origin to the ith vertex.\nThere is a natural injection\nF\u03b2~ \u2192 U\u03b2~ ,\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere a given map u(f ) \u2208 F\u03b2~ is sent to the polygon, which constitutes its range. From (A.1),\n(A.3) it is clear that this map is continuous with the topologies defined above. These\ndefinitions of topologies also settle the limit issues mentioned below (A.3). We now turn\nto prove that this injection is also onto. The induction base is trivial, since with zero\nvertices there is only a map from the upper half plane to itself, and it is trivially of the\nSchwarz-Christoffel type.\nNow, let \u03b2~ = (\u03b21 , .., \u03b2m ), and let ui approach the boundary of U\u03b2~ for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m.\nThe approach to the boundary is well defined, and the limit polygon belongs to U\u03b2~ i , where\no\nwe define\n\u03b2~ i \u2261 (\u03b21 , .., \u03b2\u0302i , .., \u03b2m ) ,\n(A.6)\no\n\nand as usual \u03b2\u0302i means that this factor is omitted. By the induction hypothesis the natural\nmap F\u03b2~ i \u2192 U\u03b2~ i is a bijection. Moreover, due to the form of (A.1), the space F\u03b2~ i is a\no\no\no\ncontinuous limit of F\u03b2~ . The above is true for all i. We can, therefore, compactify the\nspaces U\u03b2~ , F\u03b2~ , such that the compact spaces U\u03b2~ , F\u03b2~ are topologically closed cubes, and\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\fextend (A.5) continuously to the closure,\nF\u03b2~ \u2192 U\u03b2~ .\n\n(A.7)\n\nThis is true also for lower dimensional boundary components in a cellular decomposition\nof our spaces, U\u03b2~ , F\u03b2~ . These can be realized as multiple limits of vertices or prevertices.\nWe showed that by the induction hypothesis, every lower dimensional cell in the boundary of F\u03b2~ is mapped bijectively onto the corresponding boundary of U\u03b2~ . Thus, we showed\nthat when restricted to the boundary, our map is homotopic to the identity map. We can\nnow use the fact that our space is contractable in order to invoke standard topological\narguments and prove that the map is onto. Our spaces are homeomorphic to manifolds,\nso there is no loss of generality by using arguments about manifolds. It is known that a\nmap \u2202X \u2192 Y , with X, Y manifolds, that can be extended to a map X \u2192 Y is of zero\nrank. Now, suppose that the map F\u03b2~ \u2192 U\u03b2~ is not onto, and let u0 be a point not in\nthe range. Since U\u03b2~ can be contracted to u0 , we can define a map F\u03b2~ \u2192 \u2202U\u03b2~ with the\nsame boundary value as before. This shows that the boundary map is of zero rank, which\ncontradicts its homotopy to the identity. It therefore follows, that the map is a bijection\nand the Schwarz-Christoffel theorem follows.\nA.2 Generalized Schwarz-Christoffel map\nWe now turn to generalize this proof for the case of a generalized Schwarz-Christoffel map.\nThe relevant spaces in this case are U\u03b2,~\n\u03b3 = (\u03b31 , .., \u03b3n ) describing the angle\n~ \u03b3 , F\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 , with ~\ndeficits of n conical singularities on the polygon. We fix the PSL(2, R) symmetry in a\nmanner similar to the one used in (A.1), by writing\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u0001\u03b3j\n\u0013\u03b2i Y\nZ f Y\nn\nm \u0012\n \u0303\n1\n+\n|\nf\n|\n1\n+\n|f\n|\nj\ni\n\uf8ed\n(A.8)\nu = ei\u03b8\ndf\n\u0001\u03b3 /2\uf8f8 .\n\u2217\nf\n\u2212\nf\n \u0303\n \u0303\ni\n0\n(fj \u2212 f )(f \u2212 f ) j\nj=1\ni=1\nj\n\nHere fi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m are the prevertices, which are bound to the real axis. The f \u0303j , with\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 n are the pre-singularities, which take values in the upper half plane, and f \u0303j\u2217 are\ntheir complex conjugates. Again f (0) = 0, f (\u221e) = \u221e and the rescaling factor in uniquely\nfixed.\nWe adopt the geometric picture of not presenting the f plane cuts, and u plane identified curves explicitly. Geometrically there is no dependence on the form and direction\nof the identified curves, as long as they do not introduce distortions other than deficit\nangles. They can go one through another, and pass over conical singularities. They can\nend at infinity, or on the finite boundary. To illustrate this point we show in fig. 6 a simple\ncase of a polygon with a single vertex and a single conical singularity, with three different\nrepresentations of the identified curves.\nThe condition that the total deficit angle is less than \u03c0, which is the same as the\ncondition f (\u221e) = \u221e, generalize (A.3) to,\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b2i +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3j < 1 .\n\nj=1\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n(A.9)\n\n\fa\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 6: A polygon with a single vertex of \u03b2 = 41 , and a single conical singularity of \u03b3 = 12 ,\nrepresented in three equivalent ways that differ by the locations of the (dashed) identified curves. In\na, the identified curves are two lines going from the conical singularity to infinity. In b, the identified\ncurves consist of two semi-circles, which go to a point on the boundary. In c, the identified curves\nare again two lines, which now go to the vertex. There are many other possibilities for describing\nthis surface.\n\nAgain, this condition should in principle be saturated, but as mentioned above, there is no\nloss of generality by keeping it as is. The only new polygons that we miss now in addition\nto what was mentioned in footnote 3 are the wedge states, and we already know their\ndescription in terms of generalized Schwarz-Christoffel maps.\nAs before, we distinguish equivalent points in the spaces U\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 . It is clear, that\n~ \u03b3 , F\u03b2,~\nm\nn\nthe space F\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 has the topology R \u2297 H , where H is the open upper half plane. For the\n~\ntopology of U\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 , we consider a fixed value for \u03b2 and add the conical singularities one at\na time. As long as (A.9) is maintained, we have an open topological disk, that is H, for\nthe position of the next conical singularity. The space over a given \u03b2~ is, therefore, H n .\nn\nm\nThus, U\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 carries a topology of a fibration of H over R , but since the last space is\nm\nn\nhomotopically trivial, the topology is R \u2297 H , as it is for F\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3.\nWe now perform a double induction in (m, n). The pairs are \u03c9 2 -well-ordered according\n\nto,\n(m1 , n1 ) \u227a (m2 , n2 ) \u21d0\u21d2 (n1 < n2 ) or (n1 = n2 and m1 < m2 ) .\n\n(A.10)\n\n~ ~\u03b3 be given. The\nThe induction base is the same as before. Let (m, n) and an adequate \u03b2,\nspaces U\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 are naturally compactified as before. For the vertices and prevertices the\n~ \u03b3 , F\u03b2,~\nboundaries are at \u00b1\u221e as before. We want to examine the boundary of the positions of\nconical singularities. The boundary of H is the circle that consists of the real line and the\npoint at infinity. For a polygon, let a conical singularity approach the point at infinity.\nThen we see that the limit is a polygon with one less singularity. The same conclusion can\nbe drawn in F\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 due to (A.8). Now, let the point approach the real line. For the polygon\nit is seen from fig. 6 that a new vertex is created with \u03b2i+1 = \u03b3j . Thus, the boundary of\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fU\u03b2,~\n~ \u03b3 is covered with the spaces U\u03b2\n~ (i,j) ,~\u03b3oj , with\n~\u03b3oj = (\u03b31 , .., \u03b3\u0302j , .., \u03b3n ) ,\n\u03b2~ (i,j) = (\u03b21 , .., \u03b2m , \u03b3j ) .\n\n(A.11)\n(A.12)\n\nThe space Rm \u2297 H n is homeomorphic to Rm+2n in a way that is consistent with our\ndefinition of boundaries. By the induction hypothesis we get a non-trivial map of the\nboundaries, and the generalized Schwarz-Christoffel theorem follows.\nOur proofs can be further generalized in several ways. One possible generalization is to\nthe case without a vertex at infinity. Another generalization is to the case with arbitrary\ncomplex roots. In this case there should be no distinction between the real and non-real\nroots. Both should be considered as sources of conical singularities, and the map should be\nconsidered as a map of Riemann's sphere minus some points to a topological sphere with\na complex structure that has some prescribed conical singularities.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
