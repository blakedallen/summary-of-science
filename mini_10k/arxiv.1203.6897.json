However, in perturbative QCD (pQCD), the running coupling apt (Q2 ) \u2261 \u03b1s (Q2 )/\u03c0 in\nmost renormalization schemes has (Landau) singularities in the complex Q2 -plane close to the origin (|Q2 | . 1 GeV2 )\nwhich do not reflect the aforementioned analytic properties. This fact represents a serious, and often underestimated,\nconceptual and practical problem. The (spacelike) observables evaluated in pQCD, as truncated power series of\napt (\u03baQ2 ) (with \u03ba \u223c 1), do not possess the aformentioned analyticity properties; furthermore, for low values of\n|Q2 | (\u223c 1 GeV2 ), they are numerically unreliable due to the vicinity of the scale \u03baQ2 to the unphysical (Landau)\nsingularities. This numerical unreliability reflects itself in a strong dependence on the renormalization scale (\u2194 \u03ba)\nand scheme.\nOn the other hand, studies using Dyson-Schwinger equations [3, 4] and lattice calculations [5] indicate that the QCD\nrunning coupling is finite (\"conformal\") at Q2 = 0, and has, at least at positive Q2 values, no Landau singularities.\nThe problem of Landau poles in the QCD coupling was first addressed in a systematic manner about 15 years ago\n(MA)\nby the authors of [6\u20138], who constructed and used an analytic QCD coupling parameter A1\n(Q2 ) closely based\n2\n2\non the perturbative coupling parameter apt (Q ): in the dispersive integral expression for apt (Q ), they removed the\nintegration over the offending spacelike discontinuity cut (i.e., at \u2212Q2 = \u03c3 < 0), while keeping the discontinuity\n(pt)\n(spectral) function \u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 Im apt (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) unchanged on the timelike discontinuity cut, i.e., at \u03c3 \u2265 0.\nTherefore, we can call this the Minimal Analytic (MA) model. The authors of [6\u20138] called it the Analytic Perturbation\n(MA)\nApproach (APT), and provided an analogous method of construction of analytic analogs An (Q2 ) of the powers\n(MA)\napt (Q2 )n for n = 2, 3, . . .. A method of construction of analytic analogs A\u03bd\n(Q2 ) of noninteger powers apt (Q2 )\u03bd for\nMA (APT) was developed by the authors of [9]. Yet another analytic QCD model, based on the minimal analytization\nof the beta function dapt (Q2 )/d ln Q2 , was constructed and used in [10].\nOn the other hand, a more general approach of constructing analytic QCD coupling A1 (Q2 ), based on a given\nchoice of the discontinuity function \u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 Im A1 (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) (for \u03c3 > 0) was emphasized in [11, 12] and (in a\nmore specific context) in [13]. The spacelike coupling A1 (Q2 ) is then constructed from \u03c11 (\u03c3) by the usual dispersion\nrelation\nZ\n1 +\u221e\n\u03c11 (\u03c3)\nA1 (Q2 ) =\n.\n(1)\nd\u03c3\n\u03c0 0\n(\u03c3 + Q2 )\n\n\u2217\n\nDedicated to Olivier Espinosa (1961-2010).\n\n\f2\nFrom our standpoint it is this analytic coupling A1 (or equivalently: the spectral function \u03c11 ) that defines the analytic\nQCD (anQCD) model. The construction of analytic analogs An (Q2 ) of integer powers apt (Q2 )n , applicable to any\nsuch analytic QCD model, was performed in [11, 12], using the relations between the logarithmic derivatives e\napt,n (Q2 )\nn\u22121\n2\n2 n\u22121\n2 k\n(\u221d d\napt (Q )/d(ln Q )\n) and powers apt (Q )\nX\ne\nanpt = e\napt,n +\nkm (n)e\napt,n+m ,\n(2)\nm\u22651\n\nand1 imposing the condition of analogy on the logarithmic derivatives of apt and of A1 : e\napt,n+m 7\u2192 Aen+m . This\ncondition was shown to be imperative, in order to keep the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of the\nresulting truncated analytic series (in terms of Aen , or An ) of physical observables under control. The construction of\nthe power analogs An of anpt in general analytic QCD models was obtained thus from A1 via the relations analogous\nto (2)2\nX\ne\nAn = Aen +\nkm (n)Aen+m .\n(3)\nm\u22651\n\nThe extension of this construction to noninteger power analogs A\u03bd (Q2 ), for general analytic QCD models, was\nperformed in [17].\nSo, from our standpoint, it remains an outstanding problem to obtain or construct the most acceptable analytic\ncoupling A1 (Q2 ), or equivalently, the spectral function \u03c11 (\u03c3) = Im A1 (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) (for \u03c3 > 0). It is reasonable to\n(pt)\nassume that at large \u03c3 (> 1 GeV2 ) we have \u03c11 (\u03c3) = \u03c11 (\u03c3), i.e., the spectral function agrees with the pQCD result.\nOn the other hand, at low \u03c3 . 1 GeV2 , the exact behavior of \u03c11 (\u03c3) is unknown.\nThe construction of A1 (Q2 ) can be performed in two different ways. One way is to construct first the beta\nfunction \u03b2(A1 ) = dA1 /d ln Q2 as function of A1 . This approach is convenient if we take the position that \u03b2(x) is\nan analytic function of x at x = 0. In such a case, it tuns out that we obtain perturbative QCD, i.e., An = An1 .\nHowever, in this case, after ensuring additionally the analyticity of A1 (Q2 ) as a function of Q2 , it turns out to be very\ndifficult to reproduce the correct measured value of the tau lepton (nonstrange) semihadronic (V + A) decay ratio\nr\u03c4 \u2248 0.20, cf. [18]. In fact, as shown in [18], the large enough value r\u03c4 can be obtained in the perturbative analytic\nQCD frameworks only at an (unacceptable?) price of choosing a renormalization scheme with increasingly large \u03b2j\ncoefficients, which makes the analytic perturbation series of observables convergent only when up to four terms are\nincluded, and the fifth (N4 LO) term in the expansion shows an explosive increase.\nAnother way is to construct first the discontinuity (spectral) function \u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 ImA1 (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) (for \u03c3 > 0).\nThis approach leads, in general, to nonperturbative analytic QCD, i.e., An turns out to be different from An1 . We can\nfollow here analogous ideas used in the construction of the spectral functions of spacelike observables (correlators) in\nthe literature, e.g., [19\u201322]. In these references, analytization is applied directly to a considered (spacelike) observable\nD(Q2 ) itself. Some of the new nonperturbative parameters introduced there were thus specific to the chosen observable.\nOn the other hand, we take here the standpoint that it is the (universal) QCD coupling that needs analytization;\nand that the additional nonperturbative contributions for a considered observable, not contained in the analytized\nleading-twist contribution, are accounted for by a procedure containing other universal parameters. Such parameters\ncan be vacuum expectation values of higher dimensional operators, and the aforementioned additional nonperturbative\ncontributions are represented by higher-twist terms of the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) [23].\nIn our approach, at a large enough threshold value \u03c30 = M02 (\u223c 1 GeV2 ) we have the onset of the perturbative\nbehavior for the discontinuity function of the coupling\n(pt)\n\n\u03c11 (\u03c3) = \u03c11\n\n(\u03c3) , for \u03c3 \u2265 M02 .\n\n(4)\n\nOn the other hand, in the regime 0 < \u03c3 < M02 , the behavior is nonperturbative and unknown in detail, and could be\nparametrized as a sum (with different weights) of delta functions\n\u03c11 (\u03c3) =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n1\n2\n\nFn2 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 Mn2 ) , for 0 < \u03c3 < M02 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe recurrence relations leading to the above relations, within the context of the MA (APT) model of [6\u20138], were given in [14, 15].\nThe construction of higher power analogs An as linear operations on A1 (not as: An\n1 ) incorporates a nice functional property: its\ncompatibility with linear integral transformations, such as Fourier or Laplace [16].\n\n\f3\nAs has been argued in [24, 25], introduction of a sufficient number of positive delta functions in the discontinuity function \u03c1(\u03c3) = Imf (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) can approximate sufficiently well any positive Stieltjes function f (Q2 ). The analytic\ncoupling A1 (Q2 ) is a positive Stieltjes function [25]. On the other hand, application of such type of approximations\nhas been applied to the spectral functions of certain current correlators [21], under the name of the \"minimal hadronic\nansatz.\"\nIn [26], we constructed in this way a simple one-delta analytic QCD model, by introducing one delta function in\nthe low-\u03c3 regime. The model contains three free parameters,3 which were fixed by the condition (two requirements)\nA1 \u2212 apt \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )3 at large |Q2 | > \u039b2 (where \u039b2 = \u039b2QCD \u223c 0.1 GeV2 ), and the (one) requirement of reproducing\nthe correct value of the semihadronic tau decay ratio r\u03c4 .\nIt may be regarded as overly optimistic to approximate the unknown low-\u03c3 regime by a single delta funtion. In the\npresent work, we go beyond the one-delta approximation, and investigate how to parametrize the low-\u03c3 regime in a\nreasonable manner with two positive delta functions. Since such an extension introduces in the model several new\nparameters, we will fix those parameters by specific reasonable conditions, which will be similar in spirit to those of\nthe one-delta case. Specifically, the model can be made even closer to pQCD, A1 \u2212 apt \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )5 at large |Q2 | > \u039b2 ,\nwhile reproducing the correct value of r\u03c4 .\nWe do not introduce even more delta functions in the low-\u03c3 regime, because in such a case we would need values of\nmore low-energy QCD observables to fix at least some of the additional parameters. Most of the inclusive low-energy\nQCD observables, with the remarkable exception of the (V + A) ratio r\u03c4 , either have large experimental uncertainties,\nor large theoretical uncertainties due to large higher-twist contributions, or both. On the other hand, if we fix the\nparameters of the model (with more than two deltas) by simply imposing a further increase in the power index n\nof the difference A1 \u2212 apt \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )n (n > 6), and without imposing the requirement of the reproduction of any\nadditional low-energy observable value, some of the delta's become negative, indicating numerical instabilities.\nIn Sec. II we describe the model and impose the conditions which will fix the unknown parameters. In Sec. III\nwe explain how to evaluate, in any anQCD model, the leading-twist contribution of the spacelike observables and of\nthe related timelike observables, among the latter being r\u03c4 . In Sec. IV we present the numerical determination of\nthe model parameters and other numerical results. In Sec. V we summarize the results of this work and outline the\nprospects of further applications.\nII.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE TWO-DELTA MODEL\n\nAs outlined in the Introduction, we construct the two-delta (2d) anQCD model by starting with an ansatz for the\ndiscontinuity function \u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 Im A1 (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) (for \u03c3 > 0) which agrees with the perturbative counterpart\n(pt)\n\u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 Im apt (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) at sufficiently high scales \u03c3 \u2265 M02 (M02 \u223c 1 GeV2 ); and in the low-scale regime\n0 < \u03c3 < M02 its otherwise unknown behavior is parametrized as a linear combination of (two) delta functions\n(2d)\n\n\u03c11\n\n(\u03c3; c2 ) = \u03c0\n\n2\nX\n\nfj2 \u039b2 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 Mj2 ) + \u0398(\u03c3 \u2212 M02 ) \u00d7 \u03c11\n\n2\nX\n\nfj2 \u03b4(s \u2212 sj ) + \u0398(s \u2212 s0 ) \u00d7 r1\n\nj=1\n\n= \u03c0\n\nj=1\n\n(pt)\n\n(pt)\n\n(pt)\n\nwhere we denoted s = \u03c3/\u039b2 , sj = Mj2 /\u039b2 (j = 0, 1, 2), and r1\n\n(s) ,\n\n(pt)\n\n(s; c2 ) = \u03c11\n\n<\n\n(\u03c3; c2 )\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(\u03c3; c2 ) = Im apt (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb; c2 ).\n\nHere, \u039b2 (\u223c 10\u22121 GeV2 ) is the Lambert scale appearing in the following expression for apt :\napt (Q2 ; c2 ) = \u2212\n\n1\n1\n,\nc1 [1 \u2212 c2 /c21 + W\u22131 (z)]\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Q2 = |Q2 | exp(i\u03c6), the branches W\u22121 and W+1 of the Lambert function refer to the case 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < +\u03c0 and\n\u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 < 0, respectively,4 and\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u2212\u03b20 /c1\n|Q |\n1\nexp (\u2212i\u03b20 \u03c6/c1 ) ,\n(9)\nz=\u2212\nc1 e \u039b 2\n\n3\n4\n\n2 ) = 0.119/\u03c0, in the\nIn addition to the scale \u039bQCD , which was fixed by the condition of reproducing the world average value of apt (MZ\nMS scheme.\nIn MATHEMATICA [27], the functions Wn (z) are implemented by the command ProductLog[n, z].\n\n\f4\nwhere the aforementioned Lambert scale \u039b2 appears. The explicit expression (8) is the solution of the (perturbative)\nrenormalization group equation (RGE) of the form\n[1 + (c1 \u2212 (c2 /c1 ))apt ]\n\u2202apt (Q2 ; c2 )\n= \u2212\u03b20 a2pt\n.\n2\n\u2202 ln Q\n[1 \u2212 (c2 /c1 )apt ]\n\n(10)\n\nHere, \u03b20 = (1/4)(11 \u2212 2nf /3) and c1 = \u03b21 /\u03b20 = (1/4)(102 \u2212 38nf /3)/(11 \u2212 2nf /3) are the universal constants,\nwhile c2 = \u03b22 /\u03b20 is the free three-loop renormalization scheme parameter. The expansion of the beta function\n\u03b2(apt ) = dapt /d ln Q2 in general gives\n\u03b2(apt ) = \u2212\u03b20 a2pt (1 + c1 apt + c2 a2pt + c3 a3pt + . . .) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere cj (j \u2265 2) are general renormalization scheme parameters. The choice of the beta function on the right hand\nside of (10) gives cj = c2j\u22121 /cj\u22122\n(j \u2265 3), which means that the three-loop scheme parameter c2 can be chosen freely\n1\nin this form, while the higher-loop scheme parameters are then fixed. The specific \"effective three-loop\" perturbative\nbeta function of the Pad\u00e9 form of Eq. (10) was chosen for convenience, because it gives an explicit solution (8), in terms\nof the branches of the Lambert function W [28\u201330], and, at the same time, it allows us to vary the renormalization\nscheme at the three-loop level (c2 ). In the following, it will turn out to be convenient to vary the scheme parameter\n(pt)\nc2 in the explicit solution, the latter being used for \u03c11 (\u03c3) \u2261 Im apt (Q2 = \u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) appearing in the discontinuity\nfunction (6)-(7) of the anQCD model.\nThe Lambert function W = W (z) is defined via the inverse relation z = W exp(W ), cf.

(8) becomes zero at a z(uL ) in this interval.\n\nW\u22131 (z) of the Lambert function are related via complex-conjugation W+1 (z \u2217 ) = W\u22121 (z)\u2217 , and the point z = \u22121/e\nis the branching point of these functions. In the interval \u22121/e < z < 0, W\u22121 (z) is a decreasing function of z,\ncf. Fig. 1(b). When z \u2192 \u22120, the scale Q2 tends to Q2 \u2192 +\u221e, cf. Eq. (9), and W\u22121 (z) \u2192 \u2212\u221e, this reflecting the\nasymptotic freedom of apt (Q2 ) of Eq. (8). In our considered case of low-energy QCD (i.e., with number of quark\nflavors nf = 3), the solution (8) has unphysical (Landau) singularities along the positive Q2 axis, for any c2 . An\nextension of such beta function to the effective four- and five-loop case, such that the solution is explicit and involving\nLambert functions, was made in [31]. For more details on the Lambert functions, we refer to Refs. [28\u201332].\nThe aforementioned branching point of nonanalyticity z(sL ) = \u22121/e corresponds, according to Eq. (9), to the scale\n\u2212c /\u03b2\n2\nQ (sL ) = \u039b2 sL with sL = c1 1 0 (sL = 0.6347 when nf = 3), and the interval Q2 \u2208 (0, \u039b2 sL ) represents the interval\nof the unphysical (Landau) singularities of apt (Q2 ) of Eq. (8). If the scheme parameter c2 is chosen to be negative (this\nwill be our case), then there is an additional pole-type Landau singularity at a somewhat higher scale Q2 (uL ) = \u039b2 uL\n\u2212\u03b2 /c\n(\u21d4 z = z(uL ) = \u2212uL 0 1 /(c1 e)) at which the denominator of Eq.

For\nthis case, the coupling apt is presented in Fig. 2(a) as a function of z (for \u22121/e < z < 0, i.e., sL \u039b2 < Q2 < \u221e), and\nin Fig. 2(b) as a function of t = \u2212 ln(\u2212z) = 1.266 ln(Q2 /\u039b2 ) + 1.575.\n\n\f5\na pt\n\nHa L\n\na pt\n\n4\n\nHbL\n\n4\n\napt\n2\n\nz Hu L L\n\n-1\u0090e\n\n\u00c8\n\napt\n\n2\n\n- 0.35\n\n- 0.30\n\n\u00c8\n\n- 0.25\n\n- 0.20\n\n- 0.15\n\n- 0.10\n\nt Hu L L\n\nz\n\n- 0.05\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n1.5\n\n\u00c8\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nt\n\nt = -ln @-zD\n\n-2\n\nQ2\nt \u0087 1.266 ln\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\nL2\n\n+ 1.575\n\nFIG. 2: (a) The perturbative coupling apt of Eq.

The perturbative discontinuity function is denoted as r1 (s; c2 ) = Im apt (Q2 = \u2212s\u039b2 \u2212 i\u01eb; c2 ). Since the\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncut of the coupling apt (Q 2 , c2 ), Eq.

Further, the anQCD model will be constructed in such a way as to practically merge with pQCD at\nsuch sufficiently high momenta [in the considered renormalization scheme as fixed by Eq. (10)]. Therefore, we will\nconsider that the value of the Lambert scale \u039b2 used in our analytic coupling A1 (Q2 ; c2 ) coincides with the perturbative\n(MS)\n\nLambert scale \u039b2pt , the latter being determined by the condition apt\n\n(MZ2 ) = 0.1184/\u03c0, i.e., by the central value\n(MS)\n\nof the world average [33]. Therefore, \u039b2 is determined by RGE-evolving this apt down to apt ((2mc )2 ; nf = 3),\nusing the four-loop polynomial form of \u03b2 (MS) (apt ), and the three-loop matching conditions [34] at quark thresholds\n\u03bc2 = (2mq )2 (q = b, c); and then changing from the MS scheme to the scheme 'c2 ' [\u2261 (c2 , c3 = c22 /c1 , . . .)] defined by\nthe beta function of Eq. (10) (as explained, e.g., in Refs. [18, 26]).\nThe conditions we impose to fix the parameters are the following:\n1. The analytic coupling A1 (Q2 ; c2 ) acquires the aforementioned pQCD value of the scale \u039b2 of apt (Q2 ; c2 ; nf = 3)\nat Q2 = (2mc )2\n\u039b2 = \u039b2pt (nf = 3) .\n\n(19)\n\n2. While in general we expect A1 (Q2 ; c2 ) to differ from apt (Q2 ; c2 ) at Q2 > \u039b2 by \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )1 , we impose the\ncondition\nA1 (Q2 ; c2 ) \u2212 apt (Q2 ; c2 ) \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )nmax\n\nwith nmax = 5 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe condition (20) represents in practice four conditions. In the following few lines we will describe how to formulate\nthese four conditions.\nWhen we subtract from the perturbative coupling (15) the analytic coupling (18), we obtain\n2\nRes(z=uL ) apt (z\u039b2 ) X fj2\n1\napt (Q ; c2 ) \u2212 A1 (Q ; c2 ) =\n\u2212\n+\n(u \u2212 uL )\n(u\n+\ns\n)\n\u03c0\nj\nj=1\n2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n(pt)\n\ns0\n\nsL \u2212\u03b7\n\nds\n\nr1 (s; c2 )\n.\n(s + u)\n\n(21)\n\nExpanding the left-hand side in powers of (1/u) = (\u039b2 /Q2 ), the imposition of the condition (20) gives us the conditions\nthat the terms of \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )1+k (k = 0, 1, 2, 3,) in this expansion give us zero, i.e., we have the following four conditions\nZ\n1 s0\n(pt)\nds sk r1 (s; c2 ) + (\u2212uL )k Res(z=uL ) apt (z\u039b2 ) = sk1 f12 + sk2 f22 (k = 0, 1, 2, 3) .\n(22)\n\u03c0 sL \u2212\u03b7\nAltogether, Eqs. (19) and (22) represent five conditions. Once the scheme c2 parameter is chosen, we have altogether\nsix parameters in the model: f12 , f22 , s1 , s2 , s0 , and the scale \u039b. Therefore, yet another condition will have to be\nimposed, possibly involving the correct reproduction of a low-energy observable. The best candidate for this appears\n\n\f7\nto be the canonical (V + A) nonstrange and massless semihadronic \u03c4 -lepton decay ratio r\u03c4 , [35\u201337].5 When we remove\nthe (measured) strangeness-changing contribution, the color and CKM factors and the electroweak effects, and the\nchirality-violating higher twist (quark mass) contributions, the following value is obtained (cf. [38\u201340], and Appendix\nB of Ref. [18] for details)\nr\u03c4 (\u25b3S = 0, mq = 0)exp. = 0.203 \u00b1 0.004 .\n\n(23)\n\nNumerical analyses of the measured data indicate that the chirality-conserving higher-twist effects, such as gluoncondensate contributions, are negligible in the case of the considered V + A decay channel. Although such analyses\nhave been performed within pQCD+OPE approach, we will assume that they remain valid when an analysis is\nperformed with the presented anQCD two-delta model + OPE. This assumption appears to be reasonable because\nthe considered anQCD coupling A1 (Q2 ) is very close to the pQCD coupling apt (Q2 ) (in the considered scheme) at\n>\nmomenta |Q2 | \u223c 1 GeV2 . Therefore, in the calculation of the discussed r\u03c4 , Eq. (23), in the presented anQCD model,\nthe (chirality-conserving) higher-twist contributions will be ignored.\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION OF ADLER FUNCTION AND r\u03c4 IN ANALYTIC QCD\n\nThe calculation of r\u03c4 is then performed in the same way as presented in [18, 26], i.e., by performing explicitly the\nintegration corresponding to the leading-\u03b20 (LB) resummation for r\u03c4 , and adding the three known beyond-LB (bLB)\nterms (i.e., including the exact contributions of \u223c A4 ).\nIn this Section we will present only the main points of calculation of spacelike (such as Adler function) and timelike\nquantities (such as r\u03c4 ) in anQCD models. For details, we refer to [11, 12, 26], and especially Appendices C and D of\n[18].\nThe basic idea of the approach in the evaluation of spacelike observables D(Q2 ) in general anQCD model is to\nreorganize first the perturbation series D(Q2 )pt\nD(Q2 )pt = apt + d1 a2pt + d2 a3pt + . . . ,\n\n(24)\n\ninto the modified perturbation series (mpt)\nD(Q2 )mpt = apt + de1 e\napt,2 + de2 e\napt,3 + . . . ,\n\nwhere dek e\napt,k+1 are the logarithmic derivatives of apt\ne\napt,k+1 (Q2 ) \u2261\n\n(\u22121)k \u2202 k apt (Q2 )\n,\n\u03b20k k! \u2202(ln Q2 )k\n\n(25)\n\n(k = 0, 1, 2, . . .) ,\n\n(26)\n\nThey are related with the powers of apt \u2261 \u03b1s /\u03c0 in the following way [using renormalization group equations (RGE)\nin pQCD]:\ne\napt,2 = a2pt + c1 a3pt + c2 a4pt + . . . ,\n5\ne\napt,3 = a3pt + c1 a4pt + . . . , e\napt,4 = a4pt + . . . ,\n2\n\n(27)\netc.\n\nThis, in turn, means that the powers of apt are linear combinations of logarithmic derivatives\n\u0012\n\u0013\n5 2\napt,2 \u2212 c1 e\napt,3 +\na2pt = e\nc1 \u2212 c2 \u00e3pt,4 + . . . ,\n2\n5\napt,4 + . . . ,\na4pt = e\napt,4 + . . . ,\netc. ,\na3pt = e\napt,3 \u2212 c1 e\n2\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\nwhich allows us to relate the mpt coefficients with the usual perturbation series (pt) coefficients\nde1 = d1 ,\n\nde2 = d2 \u2212 c1 d1 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n5\n5 2\nde3 = d3 \u2212 c1 d2 +\nc1 \u2212 c2 d1 ,\n2\n2\n\n5\n\nThe \"canonical\" means that the normalization is used such that (r\u03c4 )pt = apt + O(a2pt ).\n\n(31)\netc.\n\n(32)\n\n\f8\nIn [11, 12] it was shown that it is imperative to construct first the analogs of the logarithmic derivatives of apt in the\nfollowing way:6\n\u0013\n\u0012 k\n\u0001\n\u2202k\n\u2202 k A1 (Q2 )\n\u2202 apt (Q2 )\n2\n=\n=\n(k = 0, 1, 2, . . .) .\n(33)\na\n(Q\n)\npt\nan\n\u2202(ln Q2 )k an\n\u2202(ln Q2 )k\n\u2202(ln Q2 )k\nThis means that the 'mpt' expansion (25) becomes in anQCD the corresponding \"modified analytic series\" ('man')\nD(Q2 )man = A1 + de1 Ae2 + de2 Ae3 + . . . ,\n\n(34)\n\n[N ]\nD(Q2 )man\n= A1 + de1 Ae2 + . . . + deN \u22121 AeN .\n\n(35)\n\nand its truncated version is\n\nHere we denoted by Aek+1 the logarithmic derivatives of A1\n\n(\u22121)k \u2202 k A1 (\u03bc2 )\nAek+1 (\u03bc2 ) = k\n,\n\u03b20 k! \u2202(ln \u03bc2 )k\n\n(k = 1, 2, . . .) .\n\n(36)\n\nThe expressions (34)-(36) are the basis of the evaluation of massless spacelike observables in any anQCD.7\nThe quantity r\u03c4 is, on the other hand, a timelike observable. However, it is expressed via a contour integration [41]\n1\nr\u03c4 =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n+\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6 (1 + ei\u03c6 )3 (1 \u2212 ei\u03c6 ) dAdl (Q2 = m2\u03c4 ei\u03c6 ) ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhich involves the (spacelike, massless, nf = 3) Adler function dAdl (Q2 ) = apt (Q2 ) + O(a2pt ).

Therefore, the full\nAdler function can be evaluated in anQCD by adding to the leading-\u03b20 (LB) contribution the three known beyond-LB\n(bLB) terms\n(dAdl )(LB+bLB)\n(Q2 )[4]\nman\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n3\nX\ndt E\nFAdl (t) A1 (tQ2 e\u22125/3 ) +\n(TAdl )n Aen+1 ,\nt\nn=1\n\n(41)\n\nIf the analytization is performed in any other way, the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of the resulting truncated analytic\nseries of any observable D(Q2 ) will in general increase (instead of decrease) when the number of terms in the series increases, cf. [11, 12].\nIf masses are involved in the evaluated physical quantity, perturbation series contains noninteger powers a\u03bdpt (and possibly derivatives\nthereof with respect to \u03bd, i.e., a\u03bdpt lnk apt ). The evaluation of such quantities in anQCD models is then based on the procedure presented\nin [17].\n(1)\n(1)\nWe have (dAdl )n = cn,n \u03b20n + O(\u03b20n\u22121 ) and (deAdl )n = cn,n \u03b20n + O(\u03b20n\u22121 ). The expansions in powers of \u03b20 are obtained when (dAdl )n\ne\nand (dAdl )n are written in powers of nf (= \u22126\u03b20 + 33/2) and then reorganized in powers of \u03b20 .\n\n\f9\nwhere\nn\n(TAdl )n = (deAdl )n \u2212 c(1)\nnn \u03b20\n\n(42)\n\nare the complete bLB parts (\u223c \u03b20n\u22121 ) of the coefficients (deAdl )n .\nUsing the expression (41) in the contour integration (37) gives for r\u03c4\nr\u03c4(LB+bLB),[4]\n\n=\n\nr\u03c4(LB)\n\n3\nX\n\n+\n\nn=1\n\n(TAdl )n I(Aen+1 ) ,\n\nwhere I(Aen+1 ) are the contour integrals given by\nZ +\u03c0\n1\ne\nI(An+1 ) =\nd\u03c6 (1 + ei\u03c6 )3 (1 \u2212 ei\u03c6 ) Aen+1 (m2\u03c4 ei\u03c6 ) (n = 1, 2, 3) ,\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nand the LB part in (43) is a well-defined (in anQCD models) integral of the form\nZ\n1 \u221e dt e\n(LB)\nFr (t) \u03c11 (tm2\u03c4 e\u22125/3 ) ,\nr\u03c4\n=\n\u03c0 0 t\n\n(43)\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\nwhere Fer (t) was calculated in [18] from the Minkowskian characteristic function FrM (t) of [48].

This procedure can be performed once we have chosen a value of the scheme parameter c2 of Eq. (10).\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this Section we present the numerical results for the parameters of the model, obtained from the imposition of\nthe aforementioned six conditions. The additional (implicit) conditions that we choose are that the weights f12 and\nf22 are positive. This is based on the fact that the discontinuity function \u03c11 (\u03c3) is positive in any reasonable scheme of\npQCD. Furthermore, the condition of positivity of \u03c11 (\u03c3) can be expressed also via the condition that the Minkowskian\ncoupling\nA1 (\u03c3) =\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c3\n\nd\u03c3\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c11 (\u03c3 )\n\u03c3\u2032\n\n(47)\n\nis a monotonously decreasing function of scale \u03c3.\nIf we choose for the scheme parameter c2 = 0, we obtain from the six conditions, as a result, that the pQCD-onset\n\u221a\nmass M0 = s0 \u039b is relatively high, M0 \u2248 1.7 GeV. Increasing c2 to positive values increases M0 further; e.g., for\nc2 = cMS\n2 /2 (\u2248 2.24) we get M0 \u2248 2.0 GeV, etc. On the other hand, decreasing c2 to negative values, we obtain\nsmaller M0 . We believe that the effective pQCD-onset scale M0 should be significantly smaller than the mass of the\n\u03c4 lepton. This turned out to be so in the one-delta anQCD model of [26], with c2 = 0, where M0 \u2248 1 GeV was\nobtained.\u221aIn general, we do not want to parametrize (via delta functions) relatively small deviations from pQCD, i.e.,\nthose at \u03c3 > 1.5 GeV. On the other hand, by lowering the value of c2 , we encounter at c2 < \u22128.0 (M0 < 0.9 GeV)\nnegative values of s2 , implying that the analyticity is lost.\nTherefore, we will adjust the scheme parameter c2 in such a way as to get M0 = 1.25 \u00b1 0.25 GeV. The results are\ngiven in Table I. We believe that all three choices of M0 will give almost the same predictions for various physical\n\n9\n\nIn (43)-(44) we used in the Adler function the renormalization scale \u03bc2 = Q2 (\u2261 m2\u03c4 ei\u03c6 ); this scale, of course, can be varied, cf. [18, 26]\nfor details.\n\n\f10\nTABLE I: The parameters of the considered two-delta anQCD model, for the three chosen values of the pQCD-onset scale M0 :\n1.0; 1.25; 1.50 GeV.

The reason for this lies in the renormalization scheme independence of pQCD results; and our model,\n<\nalthough nonperturbative and analytic at low momenta |Q| \u223c 1 GeV, is practically indistinguishable from pQCD\nat all higher momenta. It is interesting that the value of the coupling A1 at Q2 = 0, obtained in this model for\nM0 = 1.25 GeV (A1 (0) \u2248 0.8) is not far from the value in Ref. [3] (A1 (0) \u2248 8.9/Nc/\u03c0 \u2248 0.9), which was obtained\nfrom an analysis using Dyson-Schwinger equations for the ghost and gluon sector under an assumption of regularity\nof the ghost-gluon vertex.\nIn Table I we included, in the last line, also the results of the one-delta (1d) model of [26], obtained in an analogous\nway, in the scheme c2 = c3 = . . . = 0.10 In that model, though, the smaller number of parameters led to less stringent\nconditions (20), namaly with nmax = 3 (cf. also a similar model in [50]).\nIn Fig. 4(a), we present, for the resulting \"central\" choice of M0 = 1.25 GeV (c2 = \u22124.76), the corresponding pQCD\n(pt)\ndiscontinuity function \u03c11 (\u03c3) = Im apt (\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb) of the underlying perturbative coupling apt (8), in the regime of low\n|\u03c3| and including the unphysical (Landau) regime of negative-\u03c3 cut.

The latter scale was fixed in such a way that the change of the scheme parameters (c2 , c22 /c1 , c32 /c21 , . . .) to the\n(MS)\n\nMS\n2\n2\nfour-loop MS scheme parameters (cMS\n2 , c3 ), at nf = 3 and \u03bc = (2mc ) , gave the value of apt\n\n((2mc )2 ; nf = 3)\n\n(MS)\napt (MZ2 )\n2\n\n= 0.1184/\u03c0, the central value of the world average [33]. The RGE-running\nwhich corresponds to\nbetween \u03bc2 = MZ2 and \u03bc = (2mc )2 , in MS, was performed in the usual way, using the four-loop polynomial\nform of \u03b2 (MS) (apt ), and the three-loop matching conditions [34] at quark thresholds \u03bc2 = (2mq )2 (q = b, c).\nAs pointed out in Ref. [51], the aforementioned (three-loop) matching in principle introduces, indirectly, an element\nof nonanalyticity in the described framework, at12 the scale Q2 = (2mc )2 and (to a much lesser degree) at Q2 = (2mb )2 .\n(MS)\n\nThis is so because the matching introduces nonanalyticity (even: discontinuity) in the running coupling apt (Q2 )\nat those threshold scales. It would be more convenient for the presented low-energy anQCD model to be matched\n[at energies Q2 \u223c (2mc )2 ] to a scheme which introduces the quark mass threshold effects in the running in a gradual\n(analytic) way. One such scheme is the pinch technique (PT), Refs. [52]. The PT effective charge (i.e., running\ncoupling) was presented for supersymmetric QCD at one-loop in Ref. [51]. Specifically, in nonsupersymmetric QCD\nwith three massless flavors, the relations of Ref. [51] (especially their Eq. (A3)) imply (for |Q20 |, |Q2 | . (2mc )2 )\n\u0014\n\u0015\n9\n1\n1\naPT (Q2 ) = aPT (Q20 ) + a2PT (Q20 ) \u2212 ln(Q2 /Q20 ) + L1/2 (Q2 /m2c ) \u2212 L1/2 (Q20 /m2c ) ,\n(49)\n4\n6\n6\nwhere the quark threshold function L1/2 is\nL1/2 (Q2 /m2 ) = (3 \u2212 \u03b2 2 ) [\u03b2 ArcTanh(1/\u03b2) \u2212 1] + 2 ,\n\n(50)\n\np\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 + 4m2 /Q2 and the (complex) momenta Q2 are not on the cut Q2 < \u22124m2 . In the case of decoupling\n(|Q2 | \u226a m2 ), this function acquires the value of (5/3).\nWe can estimate the practical errors introduced in the calculations in our model due to the aforementioned matching\nto MS, by estimating the errors that the actual nondecoupling of the charm quark mass introduced in our calculation\nof r\u03c4 (note that in our calculation, we considered c quark to be completely decoupled, in the spirit of MS). The\nrelation (49) would be transcribed in our model, approximately, in the following way:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n9\n(51)\nA1 (Q2 )thr \u2248 A1 (Q20 )thr + Ae2 (Q\u03042 ) \u2212 ln(Q2 /Q20 ) + L1/2 (Q2 /m2c ) \u2212 L1/2 (Q20 /m2c ) ,\n4\n6\n6\n\n2\nwhere Ae2 (Q\u03042 ) is the logarithmic\np derivative of A1 defined via Eq. (36), and the scale Q\u0304 is taken to be the geometric\n13\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nmean of Q0 and Q : Q\u0304 = Q0 Q . Further, the subscript \"thr\" indicates that the nondecoupling effect mc 6= \u221e is\ntaken into account, in a first approximation. The corresponding relation in the model without the analytic threshold\neffects is\n\u0015\n\u0014\n9\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ne\n(52)\nA1 (Q ) \u2248 A1 (Q0 ) + A2 (Q\u0304 ) \u2212 ln(Q /Q0 ) .\n4\n\n12\n13\n\nWe consider, throughout, the first three flavors to be massless.\nFormally, at one-loop level, it would be equivalent to take the scale Q\u03042 = Q20 or Q\u03042 = Q2 ; numerically, though, the geometric mean of\nthese two scales (i.e., the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of these scales) is better.\n\n\f13\nTABLE III: The estimates of nondecoupling of mc in the calculation of r\u03c4 , Eq.

Namely, in such a case, the first (unknown) term in the integrand, (A1 (Q20 )thr \u2212 A1 (Q20 )),\ncan be taken to be zero, and the remaining term would indicate correctly the effects of nondecoupling of mc . On\nthe other hand, |Q0 |2 cannot be taken to be too small, as then the \u223c Ae2 term in the relations (51) and (52) would\ndominate over the A1 (Q20 ) term, due to a very large value of the logarithm ln(Q2 /Q20 ). Therefore, we will choose\nQ20 = \u03baQ2 (= \u03bam2\u03c4 exp(i\u03c6)), with \u03ba < 1 varying in a specific interval were both aforementioned restrictions are\nreasonably fulfilled\nZ +\u03c0\nq\n\u0001\n1\nd\u03c6 (1 + ei\u03c6 )3 (1 \u2212 ei\u03c6 )Ae2 ( Q20 Q2 ) L1/2 (Q2 /m2c ) \u2212 L1/2 (Q20 /m2c ) Q2 =m2 ei\u03c6 ;Q2 =\u03baQ2 .\n\u03b4r\u03c4(LO) (mc 6= \u221e) \u2248\n\u03c4\n0\n12\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\n(54)\nThe results of these estimates, for the central value of the parameters of the presented two-delta anQCD model\n(i.e., the case M0 = 1.25 GeV of Table I) are presented in Table III. We see from the Table that the effects of the\nintroduction of analytic threshold effects (i.e., the effects of the nondecoupling of mc ) in the calculation of r\u03c4 are\n(LO)\n\u03b4r\u03c4 . 10\u22123 . This is to be compared with the theoretical value r\u03c4\n\u2248 0.123 in the anQCD model, and the full\nvalue r\u03c4 = 0.203 in the model, and with the experimental uncertainties \u03b4r\u03c4 = \u00b10.004 [Eq. (23)]. We conclude that,\nalthough these effects are appreciable, they are somewhat lower than the present experimental uncertainty of r\u03c4 .\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this work we presented an analytic QCD (anQCD) model which, at high squared momenta |Q2 |, becomes to\na high degree indistinguishable from perturbative QCD (pQCD); nonetheless, at low |Q2 | the spacelike couplings\nAn (Q2 ) of the model mirror correctly the analytic properties of the (to-be-evaluated) spacelike observables D(Q2 ) as\ndictated by the general principles of the local quantum field theories. The model reproduces correctly the experimental\nvalue of the \u03c4 lepton (nonstrange, V + A) semihadronic decay ratio r\u03c4 , i.e., the only low-momentum QCD observable\nthat is well measured and whose higher-twist effects are small and appear to be under control. The difference between\nthe analytic A1 (Q2 ) and its perturbative counterpart apt (Q2 ) [\u2261 \u03b1s (Q2 )/\u03c0] is formally \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )5 at |Q2 | > \u039b2 ,\nwhere \u039b2 \u223c 0.1 GeV2 is the QCD (or: light meson) scale. The starting point was the construction of the discontinuity\nfunction \u03c11 (\u03c3) for the analytic coupling A1 (Q2 ). This \u03c11 (\u03c3) is assumed to coincide with its pQCD counterpart for \u03c3\nabove a pQCD-onset scale M02 \u223c 1 GeV2 . On the other hand, the unknown behavior of \u03c11 (\u03c3) in the low-\u03c3 regime is\nparametrized as a linear combination of two delta functions. The underlying pQCD scheme parameter c2 is adjusted\nso that the pQCD-onset scale M0 is either 1.0, 1.25, or 1.50 GeV. We believe that these three variants of the two-delta\nanQCD model represent almost the same physics, since they reproduce the same value of the key low-momentum\n\n\f14\nobservable r\u03c4 (V + A) and, at the same time, they differ in the value of the underlying pQCD (i.e., high-momentum)\nrenormalization scheme parameter c2 , the latter being the only free input parameter of the model. If the value of c2 is\nfurther adjusted so that M0 is below 1.0 GeV, the analyticity gets lost at M0 \u2248 0.9 GeV. The model is an extension\nof the one-delta anQCD model of [26] where c2 = 0 was used.\nThe main motivation behind the construction of the considered anQCD model is that with it we can eventually\nevaluate low-momentum QCD quantities whose higher-twist contributions are appreciable. An example are the\nseparate vector (V ) and axial vector (A) channel of r\u03c4 . Such evaluations would involve the considered anQCD model\ntogether with the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). This application (anQCD+OPE) is consistent, due to the very\nsuppressed difference A1 (Q2 )\u2212 apt (Q2 ) \u223c (\u039b2 /Q2 )5 in the ultraviolet regime; the latter implying that the higher-twist\nterms in OPE, of dimension d \u2264 8, will still be of infrared origin, in accordance with the philosophy of the ITEP\n(Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics) group [23].\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by FONDECYT Grant No. 1095196 (C.C., G.C.), Rings Project ACT119 (G.C.),\nand Mecesup2 Grant FSM 0605-D3021 (C.A.).
