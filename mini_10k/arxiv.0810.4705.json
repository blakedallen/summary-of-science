Rodenburg\nInstitute for Informatics, University of Amsterdam\nA short proof of a theorem of M.H. Albert, and its application to lattices.\n\nIntroduction\nIn a preliminary version of [1], Gr\u00e4tzer asked if there exists a lattice that\nis isomorphic to its lattice of ideals and in which not every ideal is principal.\nThis question was answered in the negative by D. Higgs [2].\nA related question was posed by H.-E. Hoffmann in [3]: whether an algebraic order (poset) whose compact elements again form an algebraic order\nand so on, can have noncompact elements. It was answered in the negative\nby M.H. Albert [4].\nHaving forgotten a crucial element of Higgs' proof, and unable to understand the proof in [4], I invented a simpler proof, the second, and hopefully\nthis time correct, version of which I present below, after a brief rehearsal of\ndefinitions. At the end I will indicate what baffled me.\nSubstance\nThis note is about ordered sets, that is, sets with a (partial) ordering relation \u2264 on them. We write x < y if x \u2264 y and x \u2260 y, and x -\u2039 y if y is an upper\ncover of x, that is, x < y and if x \u2264 z \u2264 y then z is either x or y. A chain is a\nlinearly ordered set.\nDefinition 1. A subset X of an ordered set L is directed if every finite subset\nof X has an upper bound in X.\nIn particular, the void subset of a directed set has an upper bound, so\ndirected sets are nonvoid.\nDefinition 2. An ordered set L is upwards complete if every directed X \uf0cd L\nhas a supremum in L.\nThe supremum of X is denoted by \\/ X. We write (X]L, omitting the subscript if it can be derived from the context, for\n{y \uf0ce L|for some x \uf0ce X, y \u2264 x}.\nInstead of ({x}], we write (x]. Dually we have [X) and [x).\nDefinition 3. An element k of an ordered set L is compact if for every directed X \uf0cd L, k \u2264 \\/ X implies k \uf0ce (X].\nWe denote the set of compact elements of an ordered set L by K(L). We\nput K 0(L) = L, Kn +1(L) = K(Kn(L)).\n\n\fDefinition 4. An ordered set L is algebraic if it is upwards complete and for\nevery x \uf0ce L, (x] \uf0c7 K(L) is directed and x is its supremum. It is iteratively algebraic if for all n, Kn(L) is algebraic.\nTheorem. If an ordered set A is iteratively algebraic, A = K(A).\nProof. Assume A is iteratively algebraic, and a \uf0ce A \u2013 K(A). Since the supremum of a chain of noncompact elements is noncompact, by Zorn's Lemma,\nA contains a maximal noncompact element m0 \u2265 a. Clearly, [m0) satisfies\nthe ACC - the supremum of an infinitely ascending chain cannot be compact.\nThe element m0 is the supremum of a directed set C of compact elements. We know that m0 is not in K(A); but C \uf0cd K(A), and since K(A) is algebraic, C has a supremum a\uf0a2 in K(A). Now a\uf0a2 is noncompact in K(A).\nAgain using Zorn's Lemma, we find a maximal noncompact m1 \u2265 a\uf0a2 in\nK(A). Then m1 \u2265 a\uf0a2 > m0; and repeating the argument we get an infinitely\nascending chain\nm0 < m1 < m2 <...\nin [m0), contradicting the ACC. So A = K(A).\n\n\uf054\uf020\n\nCorollary. If a lattice L is isomorphic to its ideal lattice, all its ideals are\nprincipal.\nProof. As an ordered set, the ideal lattice Idl(L) is algebraic; so likewise L is\nalgebraic. (L will even be an algebraic lattice if it has a 0.) The compact elements of Idl(L) are the principal ideals. The sublattice of principal ideals is\nobviously isomorphic to L, so L \uf040 K(L), which implies that L is iteratively\nalgebraic. Then by the Theorem, all the elements of L, and hence all the elements of Idl(L), are compact.\n\uf054\uf020\nDiscussion\nThe proof of the theorem certainly owes to Higgs, but omits his main\nidea: a construction of double sequences of compact elements, based on the\nobservation that a lower cover of an ideal generated by a compact element\nmust be principal. Albert [4] claims to prove the theorem, but his conclusion\nthat A = K(A), after a transfinite lopping off of maximal elements, appears\nright out of the blue. Hansoul [5] suggests a proof of the dual of Albert's\ntheorem along the lines of [2].\nReferences\n[1]\nG. Gr\u00e4tzer, General lattice theory.
