An exponential disc with a large scale-length (\u223c 7 kpc) fits well the average distribution of stars detected in both the\nSE and NW regions from a galactocentric distance of 11 kpc out to 30 kpc. The stellar disc extends beyond the Hi disc. The stellar\ndistribution at large radii is disturbed and, although there is no clear correlation between the stellar substructures and the location of\nthe Hi clouds, this gives evidence of tidal interaction or accretion events.\nKey words. Galaxies: M33 - Galaxies: evolution - Galaxies: stellar content - Galaxies: halos\n\n1. Introduction\nHierarchical models of structure formation predict that galaxies form after a series of accretion events involving lower mass\nsystems (Abadi et al. 2003; Governato et al. 2007). Within this\nscenario, a massive spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way should\nhave accreted 100-200 satellites during its evolutionary history\n(Bullock & Johnston 2005). This process would leave its imprint in a diffuse stellar halo extending out to 10-100 times the\noptical radius of the galactic disc. The density, luminosity, and\nmetallicity of the stellar halo can thus provide direct information\nabout the history and evolution of a galaxy, and enable us to test\nhierarchical formation scenarios.\nThe discovery of the Sagittarius stream in the Milky Way\n(MW) revealed for the first time the role of satellite accretion\nin the build-up of a galaxy mass (Ibata et al. 1994). Studies of\nthe MW halo using data from the Sloan Digitised Sky Survey\n(SDSS; York et al. 2000) revealed other tidal streams around\nour galaxy, proving that these features are relatively common\nand can survive for a few Gyrs (Belokurov et al. 2006; Grillmair\n2006; Belokurov et al. 2007; Grillmair 2009).\n?\nBased on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by\nthe National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\n\nSimilar features were discovered around M31, the other massive spiral of the Local Group (LG), that implied this galaxy\nhas experienced a more violent merger history than the MW\n(Font et al. 2006; Fardal et al. 2008). A giant stellar stream with\na neutral hydrogen (Hi) counterpart was found in this galaxy\n(Newton & Emerson 1977; Ibata et al. 2001; Ferguson et al.\n2002; Thilker et al. 2004). Much effort has been devoted to obtaining deeper optical images of the halo of M31 with the PanAndromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS; McConnachie\net al. 2009), which revealed a large-scale metal-poor stellar distribution (stretching out to 150 kpc), and uncovered additional\nextended substructures in the halo similar to the giant southern\nstream.\nWhile M31 clearly shows signs of disturbance in its spheroid\nand outer disc, M33, its brightest satellite and the third most\nmassive member of the LG, has long been considered an example of a \"pure disc\" system evolving in relative isolation, because\nof the lack of a prominent bulge, a seemingly unperturbed stellar\ndisc, and the absence of known nearby satellites. The origin of\nbulgeless galaxies such as M33 is difficult to explain within the\nhierarchical structure formation scenario (van den Bosch 2001),\nbecause mergers of galaxies are expected to form a bulge component. The inflow of gas at later times (z > 1) from the local environment is thought to play a major role in the growth of the discs\nof these systems (Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Brooks et al. 2009).\n1\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nNonetheless, the presence of a diffuse faint stellar halo even in\ndisc galaxies seems to be expected within the framework of current galaxy formation scenarios, predicting that a diffuse stellar\nhalo rather than a centrally-concentrated bulge would result after the late major-merger event experienced by these galaxies\n(Brook et al. 2010).\nStudies of the outskirts of M33 have started providing evidence of an extended stellar distribution beyond the optical disc,\nalthough it remains unclear whether this component corresponds\nto a stellar halo or an extended disc. Brooks et al. (2004) derived\na radial density stellar profile out to 1 degree from the centre of\nM33 finding a clear dropoff in the star counts as a function of\nradius (\u221d R\u22121.46 ), that they interpreted as a evidence of a stellar spheroid component. The metallicity peak of this sparse stellar population, [Fe/H] = -1.24 \u00b1 0.04, was lower than the abundance in the disc ([Fe/H] \u223c -0.9), and comparable to the mean\nmetallicity of a sample of halo globular clusters (Sarajedini et al.\n2000). In a spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (RGB) stars\nin M33, McConnachie et al. (2006) found that the stellar velocity distributions could be described by three different components: the galaxy disc, a halo (with [Fe/H] = -1.5), and a third\ndistribution possibly associated with a stellar stream. Finally, the\nPAndAS survey revealed an extended stellar distribution around\nM33 well beyond the main optical disc out to 3 degrees (or\na projected radius of \u223c 45 kpc) from its centre (McConnachie\net al. 2009, 2010). This structure could either be the stellar debris of an accreted satellite, or the result of a tidal interaction\nwith M31. This latter interpretation would be supported by the\nsimilar spatial orientation of the stellar features and the M33 Hi\nwarp. The origin of the Hi warp remains disputed and previous studies have proposed that it is the result of an interaction\nwith its massive neighbour (Corbelli & Schneider 1997; Bekki\n2008). Simulations of the relative motion of the M31/M33 system (Loeb et al. 2005; Putman et al. 2009; McConnachie et al.\n2009), converge on the possibility of a close encounter between\nthe two galaxies occurring a few Gyr ago with a pericenter distance around or greater than 40 kpc, which could strip material\nfrom the M33 outer disc without severely distorting or disrupting\nthe bulk of the stellar disc.\nAdditional information about the outer regions of M33 can\nbe inferred from neutral hydrogen studies. A 21-cm survey of the\nHi distribution in a region of 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6 around M33 with the Arecibo\ntelescope (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al. 2005) led to the finding\nof a population of Hi clouds in the environment of M33 (Grossi\net al. 2008). These clouds, with Hi masses ranging between 104\nand few times 106 M (at a distance of 840 kpc; Freedman et al.\n2001), were found within a projected distance of about 20 kpc,\nand they appear to be distributed (in projection) along the major\naxis of the Hi disc, towards the direction of M31. These features\ncould also be evidence of either a tidal interaction with M31, or\nthe accretion of a dwarf companion of M33. In either case one\nmight expect to find features in the stellar distribution that correspond to these Hi structures. The search for optical counterparts\nto the most massive and extended clouds may provide further insight into their origin, and the understanding of the outskirts of\nM33.\nTaking advantage of the unique sensitivity and large field\nof view of the Subaru Suprime-Cam instrument we mapped\nthrough the V and I filters sixregions in the southeastern (SE)\nand northwestern (NW) outer disc of M33 corresponding to the\nmain Hi structures found in Grossi et al. (2008). An additional\nfield to the north of the galaxy was observed to study in more detail the nature of the stellar structure at very large radii found by\nMcConnachie et al. (2009). We used colour-magnitude diagrams\n2\n\nFig. 1. Location of the seven target fields around M33 imaged\nwith Subaru/Suprime-Cam. The M33 Hi disc is highlighted by\ntwo contours with a column density of NHI = 5 and 50 \u00d7 1019\ncm\u22122 , respectively. Contours are overlaid on the GALEX (far\nultraviolet) image of M33 (Thilker et al. 2005b). The main Hi\nfeatures to the SE and NW of the galaxy are also shown.\n(CMDs) reaching down to the red clump (RC) to constrain the\nage and the metallicity of the stars at large galactocentric distances, and we searched for stellar density enhancements related\nto the gaseous features.\nThe paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2, we describe the\nobservations and data reduction process; in Sect. 3, we discuss\nthe main properties of the CMDs of the target fields; in Sect. 4,\nwe derive the distance to M33 from the tip of the RGB. We estimate the age and metallicity of the stellar populations in Sect. 5\nfrom the comparison to evolutionary stellar population models,\nwe derive in Sect. 6 the star formation history of the northernmost field of our survey using the CMD fitting method, while in\nSect. 7 we show the spatial distribution of the stellar structures\nin the target regions. Discussion of our results is given in Sect.\n8, and in Sect. 9 we summarize our conclusions.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nWe obtained V and I images with Suprime-Cam (Miyazaki et al.\n2002) on the 8.2 meter Subaru telescope on the nights of August\n21 and September 21-22, 2009. Suprime-Cam consists of ten\nCCDs of 2048\u00d74096 pixels with a pixel size of 0.2 arcsec/px\nand a total field of view of 34\u00d727 arcmin. The regions observed\nduring the run are shown in Fig. 1. The fields are labelled from\none to seven and are related to various Hi features around the\ngalaxy. Fields SE1-SE3 cover the large gaseous complex to the\nsouth-east of the galaxy (see Fig.1), whereas fields NW4-NW6\nextend from the northern edge of the disc along the Hi warp to\nthe northernmost Hi clouds detected around the galaxy in Grossi\net al.

For each field,\nwe obtained a set of 5\u00d7440s and 15\u00d7320s exposures through the\nV and I filters, with total exposure times of 2200s and 4800s, respectively. To fill the gaps between the CCD chips and improve\nthe removal of the effects of cosmic rays and bad pixels, the individual exposures were dithered by 60 arcsec along a five position\npattern. Table 1 lists the coordinates of the eight target fields and\nthe corresponding projected distance from the centre of M33.\n2.1. Photometry\n\nThe images were bias-subtracted, flat-fielded, distortioncorrected, and combined using the standard procedures of the\nSuprime-Cam Deep Field Reduction (SDFRED) software (Yagi\net al. 2002; Ouchi et al. 2004). The photometry was performed\nusing the IRAF version of the package DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987).\nA preliminary selection of detections with signal-to-noise ratio\ngreater than 4 was performed with the automatic star-finding\nalgorithm DAOFIND and the aperture photometry was obtained\nwith the task PHOT using an aperture radius of 9 pixels for the\nimages taken during the August run (fields SE1 and SE2), which\nhad the poorest seeing (see Table 1), and an aperture of 6 pixels\nfor the others. An empirical point-spread function was built with\nthe task PSF by selecting several isolated and bright stars in each\nfield. Finally PSF-fitting photometry was extracted with the task\nALLSTAR (Stetson 1994). To reduce spurious detections, the final catalogs for each field includes only objects with \u03c72 < 3, and\n| sharp | < 0.3, where \u03c72 is a parameter that indicates the quality\nof the fit, and sharp measures the spatial extent of a detection,\nbeing defined as the difference between the square of the width\nof the measure object and the square of the width of the PSF.\nThe photometry was calibrated using data for Landolt (1992)\nstandards observed during the entire run. Galactic extinction corrections were derived following Schlegel et al. (1998). We applied an average correction corresponding to the extinction at\nthe central position of each field. The adopted values of AV are\ndisplayed in Table 1.\n2.2. Completeness\n\nWe performed artificial star tests to evaluate the completeness of\nour photometry. We added artificial stars to the original images\nwith magnitudes in the ranges 19 mag < I < 26 mag, and 19 mag\n< V < 27 mag, with a binning step of 0.2 mag that was increased\nto 0.5 mag for magnitudes brighter than I = 23 mag. A total of\n\nFig. 2. CMDs of fields SE1 (top-left), SE2 (top-right), SE3a\n(bottom-right), and SE3b (bottom-right). The boxes in the topleft panel display the location of RGB and RC stars in the diagrams. Ten Gyr isochrones from Marigo et al. (2008) at a metallicity of [M/H]= -0.4, -0.7, -1, -1.3 are overlaid on the top-right\npanel to give an indication of the expected metallicity range of\nthe RGB population. Light blue and red tracks in field SE3a\n(bottom-left) correspond to a metallicity [M/H]= -0.7 and an age\nof 250 Myr, 1 Gyr, and 10 Gyr, while dark blue and purple tracks\nin field SE3b (bottom-right) indicate the same age range for a\nmetallicity of [M/H]= -0.4.\n56000 stars were injected at random positions onto each image\nfor both filters. Photometry was then performed in the same way\nas described in the previous section, and the same selection criteria on the DAOPHOT parameters were applied. The final detections were considered as stars if their position was within two\npixels of the original list of injected sources, and their magnitude within 0.3 mag of the assigned value. Our photometric data\nreach the 50% completeness level at V \u223c 25.6 mag and I \u223c 24.7\nmag in all fields.\n\n3. Colour-magnitude diagrams\n3.1. The southeastern fields in the region of the Hi complex\n\nFigure 2 shows the CMD of the three fields in the southeastern region of the galaxy where the main Hi complex is located\n(see Fig. 1). The CMDs of field SE1 and SE2, which cover the\ntwo main substructures of the southeastern gaseous complex, are\ndisplayed in the top-left and top-right panels, respectively. Field\nSE3 maps the region between the Hi feature and the optical disc\nof M33; the CMD of this area is shown in the bottom panels of\nthe figure. To differentiate the stars at the edge of the optical disc\nfrom a more diffuse stellar component, we divided the field into\ntwo halves (SE3a, and SE3b; see Fig. 1) and display the corresponding diagrams in the bottom-left and bottom-right panel of\nthe figure, respectively.\n3\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 4. CMD of the control field used to inspect the foreground\nand background contamination.\n\nFig. 3. CMDs of field NW4 (top-left), NW5 (top-right), NW6\n(bottom-left), and NW7 (bottom-right). Isochrones from Marigo\net al. (2008) are overlaid on the diagrams. Blue and red tracks\nin the first three panels indicate a metallicity of [M/H]= -0.7\nand ages of 250 Myr, 1 Gyr, and 10 Gyr. The same metallicity\nand age range is shown in the diagrams to mark the change in\nthe RGB shape from NW4 to NW6. Isochrones in field NW7\n(bottom-right) correspond to an age of 10 Gyr and a metallicity\nof [M/H]= -0.7, -1, -1.7 (from right to left) and give an indication\nof the expected metallicity range in the RGB stellar population.\nThe most prominent feature is the red giant branch (RGB),\ncorresponding to stars with colours (V \u2212 I)0 between 0.7 and\n2 mag, and I0 < 24 (see top-left panel in Fig. 2). The RGB is\nclearly detected in all fields, although in SE2 and SE3a this feature is relatively less populated, especially in the upper end. The\nedge of the optical disc of the galaxy is shown in panel SE3b as\nindicated by the redder and more populated RGB.\nBecause of the well-known age-metallicity degeneracy, different combinations of age and metal abundances are consistent\nwith the colour of this feature. This is shown in the top-right\npanel where the RGB of SE2 is compared to isochrones from\nMarigo et al. (2008) with a common age of 10 Gyr and metallicities of [M/H]= -0.4, -0.7, -1, -1.3 (from redder to blue colours),\nwhere [M/H]= log(Z/Z ) and Z = 0.019. On the other hand,\nthe width of the RGB could also be due to an age spread as the\ntwo isochrones at 1 and 10 Gyr (with [M/H]= -0.7 in SE3a, and\n[M/H]=-0.4 in S3b) show. In particular for SE3b, the age range\nof the stellar populations may be several Gyrs.\nFigure 2 also indicates a population of stars in the red clump\n(RC) phase, i.e. intermediate-age (1-10 Gyr) stars experiencing a core-helium burning phase. The average magnitude of\nthis feature is around I0 \u223c 24.4 mag, and the colour range is\n0.7 < (V \u2212 I)0 < 1.2 (as shown by the box in the top-left panel\nof Fig. 2). In addition the RC mean colour and magnitude depend on the age and metallicity of the stars (Girardi & Salaris\n2001), although the magnitude of the RC is more sensitive to\nage rather than to metallicity (Durrell et al. 2010), and its colour,\n4\n\nfor stars older than 2 Gyr, is mainly sensitive to metallicity variations (Girardi & Salaris 2001). We use these properties of the\nRC feature to constrain the age and metallicity of these stars in\nthe different fields (see Sect. 5).\nThe CMDs of SE3 show a small population of mainsequence blue stars with (V \u2212 I)0 <\n\u223c 0 that are both related to\nthe edge of the optical disc (SE3b), and scattered throughout the\nfield out to a maximum projected distance of 500 (SE3a), about\nten times the disc scale (60.4 in the J band; Regan & Vogel 1994).\nComparing the brightest magnitude of the blue stars (i.e. the\nmain-sequence turn-off luminosity) to isochrones with [M/H]=0.7 implies an age around 250 Myr.\n3.2. The northwestern fields\n3.2.1. Stellar populations in the Hi warp\n\nFields NW4-NW6 map the northwestern side of the galaxy along\nthe Hi warp out to the northernmost Hi clouds found around\nM33. The CMDs of field NW4 (Fig. 3 top-left panel) show a\nstellar population with similar properties as the southern regions\nat a comparable distance from the centre of M33 (SE2). On the\nother hand, the RGB of NW5 and NW6 (Fig. 3, top-right and\nbottom-left panels) gradually becomes bluer, narrower, and less\npopulated, implying a smaller age spread in the RGB, and/or a\nchange in the average metal abundance. Isochrones at 1 and 10\nGyr with [M/H]= -0.7 are overlaid as a comparison. A small\npopulation of blue main-sequence stars is also detected in NW4\nand NW5, out to a maximum angular distance of 600 .\n3.2.2. Stellar populations in the large stellar feature around\nM33: the NW7 field.\n\nField NW7 is not related to any Hi feature since this region was\nnot included in our 21-cm survey of M33, but was selected to\ninvestigate the stellar population of the puzzling large stellar\nfeature around M33 found by the PAndAS survey. It is roughly\none degree further north in declination than NW6. Despite being at approximately the same angular distance from the centre\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 6.

Population synthesis models with\na common age of 10 Gyr and [M/H]= -0.7, -1, -1.7 are overlaid on the CMD in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 3. They show\nthat the stellar metal abundances could range between [M/H]=1.7 and [M/H]=-1, suggesting the presence of a population with\ndifferent properties from the other fields.\n\n3.3. Foreground and background contamination\n\nFig. 5. Contamination-subtracted Hess diagrams of field SE1\n(top-left), SE2 (top-right), NW5 (bottom-left), and NW7\n(bottom-right). The resolution of the diagrams is 0.05 \u00d7 0.05\nmag, and the colour scale indicates the number of stars per pixel.\nOnly positive residuals are shown in the diagrams.\n\nof M33, the difference between the CMD of these two fields is\nstriking. NW7 shows a clearly detected RGB, and RC, in contrast to NW6, where the RC is hardly visible. While the number\nof RGB stars decreases from NW4 to NW6, NW7 shows a peculiar increase in the stellar density, given that the corresponding projected radius is around 25 kpc (for a M33 distance of 840\nkpc). Moreover, the overall colour of the RGB and RC features is\nbluer than in the other fields as can be inferred from the compar-\n\nWe observed a field offset by 4 degrees from the centre of M33 to\ntake into account the foreground and background contamination\ndue to Milky Way stars and unresolved distant galaxies misclassified as point sources. The field was processed in the same way\nas the others and the same cuts were applied to the final list of\ndetections. The CMD of this region is displayed in Fig. 4, and\nshows that contamination mainly occurs in the region between\n0.3 < (V \u2212 I)0 < 0.8 and I0 > 24 mag, and at colours redder\nthan (V \u2212 I)0 \u223c 1.5 mag. Foreground and background contaminants may affect the lower part of the RC, while the region of\nthe RGB and blue main sequence are not severely contaminated.\nAt (V \u2212 I)0 < 1 mag and I0 > 23 mag, the main sequence of\nstars in the Galactic halo is clearly visible, but mainly contaminates the blue and bright region of the CMDs, where we do not\nfind significant stellar populations related to M33. To assess the\ncontribution from foreground and background contaminants, we\nbuilt the Hess diagram of the control field, providing the density of stars at different positions in the CMD, dividing the diagram into bins of dimension 0.05 \u00d70.05 mag in colour and I\nmagnitude. We then subtracted it from the Hess diagrams of the\nother fields around M33, and, as an example, in Fig. 5 we show\nthe results for four regions. The diagrams reveal that both the\nRGB and RC can be clearly discerned after the subtraction, confirming that these features, and particularly the RC, are reliable\ndetections.\n5\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 7. Top: CMDs of fields NW4, NW5, and NW6 in radial bins of width 100. The radial angular distance from the M33 centre is\ndisplayed in the top-left corner of each plot. The isochrone that best fits the RGB slope and colour is also shown. The corresponding\nmetallicity and age are indicated in the top-left corner of each panel. Bottom: CMDs in radial bins at angular distances greater than\n800 including stars in field NW7. The stellar populations in these regions appear to be older and more metal-poor with an average\nmetallicity [M/H]= -1.3.\n\n4. The distance to M33 from the tip of the red giant\nbranch\nEstimates of the distance to M33 obtained with different methods vary considerably in the literature, ranging between 800 and\n940 kpc (Lee et al. 2002; Ciardullo et al. 2004; McConnachie\net al. 2004; Tiede et al. 2004; Sarajedini et al. 2006). Here we\nderive the distance to M33 using the tip of the red giant branch\n(TRGB) as a standard candle (Lee et al. 1993). The condition for\nthe correct application of this technique is that the observed RGB\nshould be well populated, with more than \u223c 100 stars within\n1 mag of the tip (Madore & Freedman 1995; Bellazzini et al.\n2001). Thus we built the I luminosity function of the RGB in\nthe CMD of field SE3b, which is the one that most closely fulfils this criterion, for all the stars redder than (V \u2212 I)0 > 0.7.\nWe then applied an edge detection Sobel filter to the luminosity\nfunction to locate the position of the tip. The peak of the filter\nresponse is taken as the best estimate of the TRGB magnitude,\nwhile the half width at half maximum of the same peak (\u00b1 0.08\nmag) and the photometric error at this magnitude (\u00b1 0.03 mag)\nare taken as the associated uncertainties. An additional source\nof error is given by the uncertainty in the zero-point coefficients\n6\n\nobtained from the photometric calibration, which in the I band\nis 0.05 mag. The tip is found at I0 = 20.73 \u00b1 0.1, with all errors\ncombined in quadrature. Assuming an absolute magnitude of the\nTRGB of MTI RGB = -4.02 \u00b1 0.05 (Tiede et al. 2004), this corresponds to a distance modulus (m \u2212 M)0 = 24.75\u00b1 0.11, implying\na distance to M33 of 891 \u00b1 45 kpc. However, field SE3b contains\nstars in the farthest side of the optical disc of M33. As one can\nsee from Fig. 6, the majority of the RGB stars used to determine\nthe tip reside between 20 and 30 arcmin, corresponding to a projected distance of 6 kpc or a deprojected radius of 10 kpc (being\nthe field close to the minor axis). Thus the stars are about 8 kpc\nmore distant than the center of M33, hence the implied distance\nto M33 is 883 \u00b1 45 kpc. The uncertanties in the deprojection\ngive an additional source of error of 2 kpc, which once added\nin quadrature, do not significantly increase the uncertainty in the\ndistance.\nThis distance modulus agrees with the results of groundbased observations of Tiede et al. (2004), (m \u2212 M)0 = 24.69 \u00b1\n0.07, with HST observations of M33 disc stars, (m\u2212 M)0 = 24.80\n\u00b1 0.04 (random)+0.15\n\u22120.11 (systematic), (Kim et al. 2002), and, within\nthe errors, is compatible with the distance value of 840 \u00b1 40 kpc\n(Freedman et al. 2001) that we assumed in Grossi et al. (2008).\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 8. Mean colour of the RC as a function of the angular distance from the centre of M33 in the southern (top-left) and northern\n(top-right) fields. The size of the dots decreases with the distance to the M33 centre. A clear colour gradient is found in both regions.\nMean theoretical RC colour and magnitude for different metal abundances (from [M/H]=-0.4 to [M/H]=-1.7) and ages are displayed\nin the bottom panels. The numbers along the model indicate different ages in Gyr units. The size of the filled dots in the lower panels\nis the same as in the upper panel to identify the different radial bins.\n\n5. Constraints on the age and metallicity of the\nstellar populations\nEvolved RGB and RC stars appear in a stellar population after 0.9 - 1.5 Gyr: stars first enter the RGB phase, where hydrogen is burnt in a shell around the helium core, then move to the\nRC when the core-helium-burning stage begins. Even though the\nRGB and RC are affected by the age-metallicity degeneracy, we\ncan use them together to constrain the mean metallicity and age\nof the stellar populations. As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, any variations in the RGB colour and slope are more sensitive to metallicity; the magnitude of the RC has a stronger dependence on age\n(Durrell et al. 2010), while the colour of the RC for ages older\nthan 2 Gyr is more sensitive to metallicity variations (Girardi &\nSalaris 2001). Bearing this in mind, we can use these features to\nperform a qualitative inspection of the CMDs at different radii to\nestimate the mean properties of the stellar populations as we proceed to larger galactocentric distances. Thus, we built CMDs in\nradial bins of 10 arcmin width and compared the colour, the magnitude, and the shape of these features to synthetic isochrones\nand models to investigate possible radial gradients in age and\nmetallicity.\n5.1. Age and metallicity gradients from the red giant branch\n\nFigures 6 and 7 show the spatial variation in the CMDs for the\nsouthern and northern fields, respectively. In each diagram, we\ncompared the RGB feature within the magnitude range 20.7 mag\n< I0 < 24 mag to a set of stellar isochrones with metallicity between [M/H]=-1.7 and [M/H]=-0.4 (Marigo et al. 2008).\nFor each set of isochrones, we calculated the colour difference\n\u03b4(V \u2212 I) between the observed RGB and the set of fiducial stellar\ntracks. The track that minimises the rms of the distribution of\n\u03b4(V \u2212 I) is selected as an indicator of the mean age and metallicity of the stellar population in a radial bin.\n\nThe average metallicity in the SE1-SE3 fields (Fig. 6)\nchanges from [M/H]=-0.4 at the edge of the optical disc (R <\n400 , first two panels), to [M/H]=-0.7 at angular distances R >\n400 , and the same abundance is obtained out to the outermost bin\nwhere a weak RGB is detected (700 < R < 800 ). The corresponding mean age of the populations at large radii ( R > 400 ) does not\nvary considerably with the distance, being around log(age)=9.39.35. A blue plume of main-sequence stars is detected out to the\nthird radial bin 400 < R < 500 .\nThe properties of the stellar populations in the NW fields\n(Fig. 7) appear similar to the SE ones when one considers the\nsame range of angular radii (350 < R < 700 ): the average metallicity is found at [M/H]=-0.7 and the stellar ages in these radial bins vary between 2 and 2.5 Gyr (9.3 and 9.4 in logarithmic units). Young main-sequence stars are also detected in these\nfields out to a radial distance of 600 . The outer radial bins instead,\nat R > 700 , show an older and more metal-poor RGB stellar population, evidence that becomes more compelling when stars from\nNW7 are included (Fig. 7 lower panel). The lower metallicity of\nthe RGB stars at these radii is suggested by the overall bluer\ncolour than the stars in the bins closer to the M33 centre. While\nthe RGB and RC features become weaker from NW4 to NW6\n(upper panel of Fig. 7), there is a clear increase in the number\nof stars in NW7 out to the last radial bin (1100 < R < 1200 ). The\nisochrones that most closely reproduce the slope and colour of\nthe RGB have [M/H]=-1 in the NW6 field (Fig. 7, upper panel),\nwhereas when stars in NW7 are included (lower panel), the average population at R > 900 appears to be even more metal-poor\n([M/H]= -1.3) and older (between 5 and 7 Gyr).\n5.2. Age and metallicity gradients from the red clump\n\nWe derived the mean photometric properties of the RC as a function of radius following Girardi & Salaris (2001). We determined\nthe histogram of the I magnitude and colour distribution of stars\n7\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nin regions of the CMDs including the locus of the RC, located\nwithin 24 mag < I0 < 24.7 mag and 0.7 mag < (V \u2212 I)0 < 1.2.\nWe then fitted a Gaussian plus a quadratic background function\nto both histograms, taking the central values of the Gaussians as\nthe mean magnitude and colour of the clump. Given the difficulty in identifying a clear clumping of stars in the RC region\nin the third and fourth bin of the SE fields, or the low number\nof RC stars in the radial range between 700 and 900 in the NW\nones, the results of our analysis at these radii should be treated\nwith caution. To maximize the number of stars in the RC area,\nthe range of angular distances between 700 and 900 was considered as one single bin, and the outermost regions (R > 900 )\ninclude detections from both NW6 and NW7.\nThe results of our analysis are shown in Fig. 8. In the upper\npanels, we plot the RC colour versus radius for the SE (top-left),\nand NW (top-right) fields. The size of the dots decreases with\nthe distance to the M33 centre to help us to identify the radial\nbins in the lower panel plots. In both regions, there is a clear\nchange in (V \u2212 I)0 with radius. In the lower panels, the mean\nRC colour and magnitude are compared to the models of Girardi\n& Salaris (2001) to assess more reliably the range of age and\nabundances of the populations. The models show that variation\nin the metal abundances is the main driver for the colour change:\nthe metallicity ranges from [M/H]=-0.4, [M/H]=-0.7 in the inner bins, down to [M/H]=-1.3/-1.7 in the outermost ones. This\nagrees with what we found from the RGB analysis. However,\nthe error in the photometry (and in the distance modulus for MI )\ndisplayed in the figure make the determination of the age subject\nto some uncertainties. In the SE fields, the redder bins correspond to stars with ages around 2 Gyr and [M/H]=-0.4, while at\n400 < R < 800 the colours and mean magnitude of the RC are\ncompatible with an age between 0.8 Gyr and 1.5 Gyr, slightly\nlower than what we found for the RGB stars, and a metal abundance of [M/H]=-0.7. In the NW fields, the colour and magnitude of the RC in the first bin may correspond to a population\nwith either a mean age of \u223c 2 Gyr and [M/H]=-0.7, or an age between 1 Gyr and 2 Gyr with a higher abundance ([M/H]=-0.4).\nAt 500 < R < 700 , a metallicity of [M/H]=-0.7 would imply an\nage between 1 and 2 Gyr, although even older ages would be\ncompatible with the photometric errors.\nAt larger radii (R > 700) the NW data indicate that the properties of the stellar population clearly differ. The colour becomes\nbluer than (V \u2212 I)0 = 0.85, corresponding to ages older than 5\nGyr and an abundance of [M/H]=-1.3 (700< R < 900) or lower in\nthe most distant bins at R > 900 ([M/H]=-1.7). In the following\nsection, we try to more tightly constrain the range of ages and\nmetallicities of stars in the outermost field by comparing the observed CMDs to models with a range of star formation histories\n(SFHs).\n\n6. Star formation history of field NW7\nA more accurate constraint of the properties of the stellar populations in the northernmost region may help us to untangle the\norigin of the stellar feature around M33. Therefore, we applied\nthe method of synthetic CMD fitting to the diagram of NW7 to\nderive the best-fit SFH of the stellar populations in this region.\nWe used the StarFISH package (Harris & Zaritsky 2001),\nwhich determines the best-fit CMD according to a maximum\nlikelihood statistic. To build the model CMDs, we selected four\nsets of isochrones with metallicities [M/H]=-1.7, -1.3, -1.0, -0.7,\nand ages between 1 and 10 Gyr (with a time binning step of\nlog(age) = 0.2), as derived from the analysis of the RGB and\nRC features in Sect. 5. The code populates the set of stellar\n8\n\nFig. 9. Star formation rate as a function of time of field NW7 obtained from the CMD fitting analysis (top), and the resulting synthetic CMD (bottom-left) compared to the observed one (bottomright). A 6.3 Gyr (log(age) = 9.8) isochrone with [M/H]= -1.3 is\noverlaid on the RGB of both diagrams.\n\nisochrones (Marigo et al. 2008) assuming a given initial mass\nfunction (Salpeter 1955), shifting the magnitudes according to\nthe distance modulus, and applying photometric scatters derived\nfrom the artificial star tests (see Sect. 2.2 for details). Each synthetic CMD with a given range of ages and a fixed metallicity\ncan be linearly combined to construct a model diagram for any\narbitrary SFH. The code then determines the best-fit SFH performing \u03c72 minimization of the differences in the number of stars\nbetween the model and observed CMD.\nWe tried fitting several combinations of the four sets of\nisochrones and found the best-fit solution for a metallicity\n[M/H]=-1.3. The corresponding SFH and model CMD are displayed in the upper and lower-left panel of Fig. 9, respectively.\nThe error bars reflect the 1\u03c3 confidence interval on the star formation rate averaged over an age bin. According to the recovered\nhistory of star formation, the stellar population in NW7 is metalpoor and older than 4 Gyr ago, and most of the stars formed\naround 6+1.6\n\u22121.3 Gyr ago. This agrees with our qualitative analysis in Sect. 5. The derived star formation rate corresponds to a\ntotal stellar mass of \u223c 2 \u00d7 106 M . A comparison to the observed data (lower-right panel) shows a reasonably good match.\nAn isochrone at 6.3 Gyr (log(age) = 9.8) is overlaid on both\ndiagrams to guide the reader's eye. However, the match is not\nperfect since the colour of the simulated RGB appears roughly\n0.1 mag redder than the observed one at I0 > 23.5, and \u223c 0.05\nmag bluer in the upper part of the RGB. Adding higher metallicity isochrones at [M/H]= -1 to the model diagram in order to\nmatch the upper part of the RGB did not help us to improve the\nfit but led to an overall too red CMD.\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\ninstead to the stellar counterpart of the southern Hi warp\n(McConnachie et al. 2009).\nIn the northern fields, an extended stellar structure is detected\nin NW4 and NW5, along the Hi warp. Most of the stars appear\nto be located within the Hi disc, beyond which the stellar density\nrapidly decreases. Isolated and fainter clumps can be identified\nin field NW6. In particular, two overdensities match the position of one of the northern Hi clouds (whose column density\ncontours are overlaid in the figure), although the stellar overdensities appear to be offset from the peak of the Hi column density.\nFigure 11 mainly stresses the difference in the stellar distribution between the fields, along the Hi warp and the northernmost\nregion. While the stellar density decreases from NW4 to NW6,\nfield NW7 shows a higher concentration of stars, especially to\nthe northern side of the field where few overdensities are visible. The distribution of stars stretches to the north-west towards\nM31 forming a low surface brightness structure that extends to\na maximum projected radius of \u223c 3 degrees as one can see from\nthe map of McConnachie et al. (2010).\n\n8. Discussion\n8.1. Hi clouds and stellar counterparts\n\nFig. 10. Spatial distribution of RGB and RC stars with 20.7 mag\n< I < 24.6 mag in the southern fields.

Stellar spatial distribution and comparison to the\nHi features\nFigures 10 and 11 show the spatial distribution of the RGB and\nRC stars in the southern and northern fields, respectively. We\nselected stars with I magnitudes in the range 20.7 mag < I <\n24.6 mag, divided the fields into square bins with a size of 10\u00d7 10\n, and determined the number of stars in each bin. The final image\nof the spatial distribution was obtained after convolving the 2-D\nhistogram with a Gaussian filter of FWHM five times the bin\nsize (50). The density contours of the main Hi features detected\nin these regions are overlaid for comparison.\nThe figures show several structures overlaid on a more diffuse distribution of stars. The main features in Fig. 10 are:\n\u2013 The main overdensity at the top-right corner of the figure\ncorresponds to the edge of the optical disc. A filament-like\noverdensity is connected to the stellar disc and extends out\nto the upper edge of the Hi complex (field SE3).\n\u2013 A fainter concentration of stars in the central part of the figure (corresponding to field SE2) at a declination of 30\u25e6 , possibly related to the peak density of the main Hi complex.\n\u2013 An arc-like feature is visible to the southwest showing an\nenhancement in the distribution of stars in this region. This\noverdensity is not, however, spatially coincident with the\nsouthern extension of the Hi complex. It is possible that\nthis increase in the number density of stars might be related\n\nThe search for optical counterparts to Hi clouds has often turned\nout to be a difficult task with very few successful detections.\nAn optical study of 264 high velocity clouds down to a surface\nbrightness limit of \u03bcV \u223c 26 mag arcsec\u22122 resulted in no detections (Simon & Blitz 2002). Even for one of the most massive\nhigh velocity clouds in the Milky Way, complex H (Hulsbosch\n1971; Dieter 1971), infrared, and millimeter wavelength observations did not reveal any evidence of either current star formation or an evolved population (Simon et al. 2006). However, Hi\nclouds are often found close to stellar streams or disturbances\nin the stellar disc, as seems to be the case in M33. For example, the Hi clouds found near the southeastern edge of the disc\nof M31 (Thilker et al. 2004; Westmeier et al. 2005, 2008) are\nspatially and kinematically correlated to the giant stellar stream\n(Ibata et al. 2001), implying that those clouds could be the result of either tidal or ram-pressure stripping of a former satellite\ngalaxy.\nThe main purpose of our study has been to search for an optical counterpart to the most extended Hi features that we found\nin a 21-cm survey around M33. The cloud properties seems to\nbe indicative of a process of accretion or tidal disturbance in the\nouter regions of M33. This is confirmed by the features in the\nstellar population discussed in this paper and previous works,\nand also by the discovery of an extended cluster to the southeast\nof the galaxy (Stonkut\u00e9 et al. 2008). However we do not find\nconvincing evidence of a young stellar population (\u223c 100 Myr)\nrelated to these features. This means that there has not been in\nsitu star formation in these clouds, as indicated by their low column densities, whose peak values in Hi are only around 1019\ncm\u22122 (Grossi et al. 2008). We find a sparse and more evolved\nstellar population in the proximity of the Hi complexes in SE1SE2, and some isolated clumps of stars are visible throughout the\nouter field NW6, but there is no clear evidence of a correlation\nbetween the stellar structures and the gas clouds.\nOn the other hand, the stellar structures detected in fields\nNW4 and NW5 (Fig. 11) follow the distribution of the Hi warp,\nsuggesting that these stars represent the optical counterpart to\nthe perturbed Hi disc, and that the stellar component \u2013 as in the\ncase of the gaseous one \u2013 has a warped distribution.\n9\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 11.

The resolution of the map is\n10\u00d7 10, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 5 pixels FWHM (shown at the top-right corner of the figure). The colour scale indicates\nthe number of stars per pixel. The density contours of the Hi clouds detected in this region are overlaid as a comparison. Contours\nare at 3.5, 6, 8.5, 11, 13.5 \u00d71018 cm\u22122 .\n8.2. Stellar surface density at large radii: stellar halo or\nextended disc?\n\nThe fields we observed with Subaru/Suprime-Cam probe different regions beyond the optical disc of M33 (R25 = 350 .5).\nCombining the information gathered from the analysis of the\nstellar populations, we found a trend of decreasing metallicity\nwith radius. Determining the radial profile of the stellar surface\ndensity can help us to discriminate the nature of the different\nstellar components that are related to these metallicity variations\nat large radii (extended disc or a stellar halo). Thus, to derive the\nsurface density we divided the surveyed area into radial bins using two different geometries: a) circular rings to investigate the\npossibility that most of the stars we detect trace a smooth stellar halo; b) elliptical annuli with position angle and inclination\ngiven by Corbelli & Salucci (2000), if most of the stars lie in an\nextended disc that follows the Hi distribution. We discuss these\npossibilities in the following subsections.\nWe selected RGB stars with I0 between 20.7 mag and 24\nmag, and colours (V \u2212 I)0 > 0.7 mag, limiting our analysis to\nRGB stars to ensure a higher completeness level on the photometry.\n8.2.1. Stellar halo density profile\n\nWe derived the number counts in radial circular bins of width\n50 for R < 400 and width 100 for R > 400 . A different spacing was chosen to more accurately trace the profile at the edge\n10\n\nof the M33 stellar disc. The number counts in each bin were\nthen divided by the area of the corresponding region. The level\nof contamination was estimated from the control field selecting\nthe number of detections within the same magnitude and colour\nrange of the RGB stars (see Fig. 4). The surface density of contaminants was found to be \u223c 0.1 arcmin\u22122 , and subtracted from\nthe number counts in each radial bin.\nFigure 12 (left panel) shows the RGB surface density versus\nthe projected radius. The open squares and the filled dots indicate the contamination-subtracted surface density in SE1-SE3\nand NW4-NW6, respectively. Star symbols represent the surface density when NW7 is also taken into account. Error bars\nare given by the square root of involved star counts scaled by the\narea of each region.\nOur data set allows us to study the decline of the M33 density profile out to a projected radius of 900 and 1200 in the SE\nand NW fields, respectively. A change in the shape of the profile\noccurs in the SE fields (open squares) at radii greater than 400 ,\nwhere the optical disc ends; beyond 500, the profile shows a similar trend in both the northern and southern regions. The density\nenhancement at radii greater than 900 (star symbols) is due to the\npopulation in field NW7 belonging to the large stellar feature to\nthe north of M33. The density here is about two times higher\nthan that found in NW6 only. The overdensity extends further\nnorth of NW7 for about one degree along the direction to M31\n(McConnachie et al. 2010).\nA power-law profile, Rn , representing the spatial distribution\nof a spheroidal stellar halo, was then fitted to the data at R > 400 ,\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\nFig. 12. Stellar surface density profiles in the observed fields versus projected (left) and deprojected (right) radius. The open squares\nand filled dots show the stellar surface density in the SE1-SE3, and NW4-NW6 fields, respectively. Star symbols indicate the density\nat large radii when field NW7 is also included. The M33 stellar disc extends out to 400 , while at larger radii there is a clear change in\nthe surface density. A power-law profile (Rn ) is fitted to the data in the left panel to investigate the presence of a stellar halo. We did\nnot attempt to fit the star points because of the anomalous overdensity in field NW7. An extended disc component (e\u2212R/h ) is fitted\nto the data in the right panel. The best-fit parameters for each model are displayed in the panels.\nleaving out the overdensity in NW7 (star symbols). We find bestfit power-law indices n = \u22122.13 \u00b1 0.24 and n = \u22122.24 \u00b1 0.33\nin the NW and SE regions, with a \u03c72 of 1.4 and 1.8 , respectively. The two resulting power-law indices are compatible with\na unique distribution, even though the northern side has a somewhat higher density. Our result is comparable to that found in\nthe MW and M31 stellar halos: the surface density profile of\nhalo stars in the Galaxy falls off with galactic radius following a\npower-law index varying between -1.5 and -2.6 (Chiba & Beers\n2000; Juri\u0107 et al. 2008; Bell et al. 2008; Juri\u0107 et al. 2008). In\nM31, Ibata et al. (2007) obtained a surface density profile with a\npower-law index of n = \u22121.91 \u00b1 0.12, while Tanaka et al. (2010)\nfound a steeper power law with n = -2.17 \u00b1 0.15.\n8.2.2. An extended outer disc\n\nWe investigate the presence of an extended stellar disc under the\nassumption that it follows the same orientation as the warped Hi\ndisc. If an extended stellar disc is in place, the stellar surface\ndensity can be inferred by deprojecting the stars onto the plane\nof the galaxy. For a warped disc, a tilted ring model is needed.\nFollowing Corbelli & Salucci (2000), we assumed that the outer\ndisc position angle varies between 21\u25e6 and -11\u25e6 , while its inclination stays roughly constant at about 50\u25e6 . Hence, we computed\nthe location of the elliptical contours in the plane of the sky corresponding to fixed galactocentric radii, i.e. the radii of the tilted\nrings. We used radial spacing of 50 for the innermost ellipses and\n100 for ellipses with major axis larger than 500. We then assigned\neach star to a ring and compute the stellar surface density in the\nring areas covered by our survey.\nThe deprojected surface density is displayed in the right\npanel of Fig. 12. The figure now shows an excess density in the\nSE fields between 400 and 600 , and a very good match between\nthe density values of the northern and southern regions in the\nfollowing two bins (600 < Rdep < 800 ). An exponential profile\nwas fitted to the density distribution for Rdep > 400 . The best-fit\nscale-length is h =250.4 \u00b1 00.3, with \u03c72 = 0.7. This scale-length\n(\u223c 7 kpc) is much larger than the stellar scale-length of the in-\n\nner disc (\u223c 1.5 kpc). The stellar drop-off in M33 is also slightly\nshallower than the Hi decline in the same area.\nGiven the better fit obtained after deprojecting the stellar distribution, we conclude that the observed surface density in our\nfields seems to be more consistent with an extended disc component than a smooth stellar halo. However, we emphasize that our\nanalysis is based on fields selected along the Hi warp, and our\nresults do not exclude that the contribution of a faint spheroidal\nhalo could be investigated more effectively in different regions\naround M33. Fields from the PAndAS survey at similar angular distance as NW6 and NW7 along directions not polluted by\neither the disc or the large stellar feature around the galaxy, contain a small RGB population and are presumed to represent an\nunderlying halo population in this galaxy.\n8.3. The large stellar feature around M33\n\nThe origin of the large stellar feature around M33 is discussed\nin McConnachie et al. (2009, 2010), and we refer the reader to\nthose papers for more details. Here we summarise the main conclusions of these authors in light of our additional results. Their\nfavoured scenario assumes that the structure is the result of a\ntidal disturbance caused by the motion of M33 around M31. The\nnorthwest - southeast symmetry of the \"S-shaped\" structure, and\nthe rough alignment with the Hi warp, are the main pieces of\nevidence supporting this interpretation. Simulations of the M31M33 system have showed that a close encounter at a pericentre\ndistance of about 40 kpc would excite tidal tails in M33 without severely distorting or disrupting the disc. These simulations\nalso set the epoch of the encounter to be between 2 and 3 Gyr\nago. However, within this scenario it would be difficult to reconcile the metallicity difference between the structure ([M/H]=1.3) and the disc ([M/H]=-0.7,-0.4) stellar populations, a difference that we also detect within our data set.\nOn the other hand, if the structure originated from the disruption of a dwarf galaxy such a difference in the metal abundance\nwould not be an issue, and this scenario is also considered as a\nplausible alternative. The lack of a visible progenitor would imply that the dwarf galaxy has been entirely destroyed prior to the\n11\n\n\fM.Grossi et al.: Stellar structures in the outer regions of M33\n\n9. Summary\nWe have presented Subaru/Suprime-Cam V and I observations\nof seven fields around the disc of M33. The fields cover regions\nof the sky where Hi complexes were detected by the ALFALFA\nsurvey, the northern Hi warp, and part of the extended feature\nthat was discovered around the galaxy by the PAndAS survey.\nWe have studied the properties of the different stellar populations\nusing CMDs, estimated the mean metallicity and age in each\nregion, and determined the radial distribution of stars. Here we\nsummarise our main results:\n\nFig. 13. Hi surface density versus deprojected radius. The vertical line shows the maximum distance at which young blue stars\nwere detected. Young stars are found out to a radius that is comparable to the distance beyond which the Hi surface density declines abruptly.\n\ncurrent epoch. From the SFH that we derived in Sect. 6, the total stellar mass in field NW7 would amount to \u223c 2 \u00d7 106 M ,\nand McConnachie et al. (2010) estimate that the total luminosity\nof the whole structure is MV = \u221212.7, comparable to that of a\nbright LG dSph. Our data cannot provide constraints that enable\nus to rule out one of these possibilities, but it is interesting to\nnote that the lower limit we infer to the age of the stars (log(age)\n= 9.5 or \u223c 3.2 Gyr), is comparable to the epoch of the encounter\nbetween the two galaxies predicted by the simulations.\n8.4. Recent star formation beyond R25\n\nIn Sect. 3, we pointed out that a population of young stars, with\nages around or older than 200 Myr, was detected in SE3, NW4,\nand NW5. The majority of them were found within 500, with a\nfew blue stars detected out to a galactocentric radii of 600(\u223c 17\nkpc; see Fig. 6 and 7). Finding evidence of recent star formation\nactivity is surprising at these radii, given the low column density\nof the gas. As a comparison, we show in Fig. 13 the M33 Hi\nsurface density as a function of the galactocentric distance along\nthe Hi warp. At 600, the gas surface density is around 0.6 M pc\u22122\n(or \u223c 7.5\u00d71019 cm\u22122 ), roughly eight times lower than the density\nat R25 , then starts to decline abruptly at Rdep > 700.\nThe presence of such young populations at large galactocentric radii challenges the current picture of star formation given\nby the Schmidt-Kennicut law (Kennicutt 1998). However, studies of nearby spirals based mainly on GALEX observations have\nshown that star formation can also occur beyond R25 in a lowdensity environment (Thilker et al. 2005a, 2007). Stellar associations with an average age of \u223c 150 Myr were found in the\nouter discs of a sample of five nearby spiral galaxies (Alberts\net al. 2011). Bigiel et al. (2010) studied star formation rates in\nthe far outer discs of spirals where Hi is the dominant gaseous\ncomponent. In contrast to the inner parts of the disc, the Hi density and the star formation rate (derived by the far UV emission)\nshowed an overall good correlation, implying that different processes may govern the formation of stars at large galactocentric\ndistances.\n12\n\n1. We confirmed the presence of an extended population of\nevolved stars (in the RGB and RC phase) with ages between\n1 and 10 Gyr out to an angular distance of 1200 (\u223c 30 kpc).\n2. A sparse population of young stars with ages around 100200 Myr is detected both to the NW and to the SE out to a\ngalactocentric radius of \u223c15 kpc.\n3. We did not find a clear optical counterpart to the main Hi\ncomplexes detected around the optical disc, although stellar\nstructures are detected in all target regions. This provides evidence that the stellar distribution at large radii is disturbed\nin a similar way to the gaseous one because of either tidal\ninteraction or accretion.\n4. We used the shape and colour of the RGB as well as the magnitude and colour of the RC to derive the metallicity of the\ndominant stellar population in each field. The mean metallicity gradually decreases from [M/H]=-0.4 at the edge of the\noptical disc, down to <\n\u223c \u22121, out to a radius of \u223c 30 kpc.\n5. The surface radial profile of the stellar distribution in our\nfields can be more closely fitted by an extended disc component with a scale-length of \u223c 7 kpc, rather than a smooth\nstellar halo. This suggests that the stars as in the case of the\ngas have a warped distribution. However, this does not exclude the presence of an underlying stellar halo, which may\nbe more accurately studied by targeting other regions around\nthe galaxy.\n6. Finally we analysed the stellar populations in a region between 1.5 and 2 degrees north of M33 probing part of the\nlarge stellar plume surrounding the galaxy. The RGB and RC\ncolours show a more metal-poor and older population than in\nthe other fields. A CMD fitting analysis shows that stars in\nthis region formed between 3 and 10 Gyr, with a metallicity\nof [M/H]= -1.3.\nAcknowledgements.
