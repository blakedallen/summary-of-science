We present the numerical results for low temperature behavior of the transversefield Ising model on a frustrated checkerboard lattice, with focus on the effect of both quantum\nand thermal fluctuations. Applying the recently-developed continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithm, we compute the magnetization and susceptibility down to extremely low\ntemperatures while changing the magnitude of both transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields.\nSeveral characteristic behaviors are observed, which were not inferred from the previouslystudied quantum order from disorder at zero temperature, such as a horizontal-type stripe\nordering at a substantial longitudinal field and a persistent critical behavior down to low\ntemperature in a weak longitudinal field region.\n\n1. Introduction\nFrustration due to the geometrical structure of systems has been one of the major topics\nin condensed matter physics. The interest covers a wide range of fields, such as frustrated\nmagnetism [1], proton ordering in hydrogen-bonded systems [2, 3], and anomalous transport\nand multiferroics in transition metal oxides [4, 5, 6]. The geometrical frustration often prevents\nthe system from selecting a unique ground state, instead gives rise to classically degenerate\nground states; i.e., a macroscopic number of different configurations of the system variables lead\nto the same ground state energy at the classical level. As a result, the ground state remains\nto be disordered and bears finite residual entropy. Such macroscopic degeneracy provides a\nfertile ground for various peculiar phenomena as it makes the system to be extremely sensitive\nto perturbations, such as remnant interactions, external fields, and fluctuations.\nAmong such degeneracy-lifting mechanisms, quantum and thermal fluctuations have attracted\nparticular interest. These fluctuations sometimes lift the ground-state degeneracy and induce\nsome particular ordering, as known by order from disorder [7]. There, the ordering is selected\nfrom the manifold to maximize the associated entropy (zero-point entropy in the case of quantum\nfluctuation). This entropic effect plays a decisive role at low temperatures (T ) and causes many\nfascinating phenomena in the frustrated systems.\nOne of the minimal models for studying the order-from-disorder phenomenon is the\ntransverse-field Ising model (TIM). In the absence of geometrical frustration, in general, the\nmodel develops a long-range order at low T , while the ordering is suppressed and a quantum\nparamagnetic state is induced by the transverse field. When the classical ground state is\n\n\fmacroscopically degenerate under strong frustration, quantum fluctuations by the transverse\nfield and/or thermal fluctuations by temperature can induce a particular ordering via the orderfrom-disorder mechanism. Effect of thermal fluctuations has been studied mainly in the absence\nof the transverse field, i.e., for pure Ising models without the transverse field [1, 8]. Meanwhile,\neffect of quantum fluctuations has also been studied. For example, it was shown that TIM on a\nvariety of frustrated lattices exhibit several nontrivial behaviors at T = 0, such as a bond ordering\nand Kosterlitz-Thouless transition [9, 10]. In general, the thermal and quantum fluctuations do\nnot necessarily lead to the same effect, and the relation between them is of particular interest\nto explore yet another order-from-disorder phenomenon.\nIn this contribution, we present our numerical results for the order-from-disorder phenomena\nin TIM in a wide range of temperature and the transverse/longitudinal magnetic fields. We\nconsider the TIM on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice and study its low-T physics by\na sophisticated quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique. As a result, in the intermediate\nlongitudinal-field regime, we find instability toward a Neel order, in accordance with the previous\nreport [10]. On the other hand, for both the weaker and stronger longitudinal fields, our results\nindicate different behaviors from the previous report. Under the weak field, featureless magnetic\nsusceptibility is observed down to extremely low T , which implies a very weak proximity effect\nto the predicted Neel ground state or a possibility of another state in the T = 0 limit. On the\ncontrary, in the strong field, the system indicates instability toward an unexpected horizontaltype stripe ordering.\n2. Model and method\nTo investigate the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations on the classically degenerate\nground state in frustrated systems, here we focus on the frustrated checkerboard Ising model\nwith transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields. The Hamiltonian is given as:\nX\nX\nX\nH=J\nszi szj + \u0393\nsxi + h\nszi ,\n(1)\nhi,ji\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere s\u03b1i is the Pauli spin operator at site i, and J is the Ising interaction between nearestneighbor sites hi, ji on the checkerboard lattice (see Fig. 1); \u0393 and h are the transverse and\nlongitudinal fields, respectively. In the following, we consider the antiferromagnetic case, J > 0,\nand set the energy scale by J = 1.\nWhen \u0393 = h = 0, the model remains to be disordered down to zero T [8]. The lowest energy\nis achieved by enforcing a simple local constraint - a two-up two-down local spin configuration\nfor all the plaquettes with crisscrossing interaction, similar to the so-called ice rule in water ice\n[2]. Consequently, a macroscopic number of different spin configurations give the same lowest\nenergy: The ground state is macroscopically degenerate and the residual entropy is estimated to\nbe \u223c N2 log 23 (N is the number of spins). The spin correlation, however, is critical in the sense\nthat it decays algebraically as a function of distance. The situation is unaltered as h increases\nup to h = 2J at \u0393 = 0. (For larger h, the ground state consists of \"three-up one-down\"\nconfigurations, which is also macroscopically degenerate.) When the quantum fluctuation sets\nin by switching on \u0393, it was predicted, from perturbative considerations in \u0393/h, that a Neel\norder is induced in the 0 < h < 2J region at T = 0 [10] [see Fig. 1(a)]. Hereafter, we focus on\nthe 0 < h < 2J region.\nTo investigate the low-T behaviors of this model with taking account of both quantum\nand thermal fluctuations, we conducted numerical calculations by QMC method based on the\npath-integral approach [11, 12]. Here, we employed the recently-developed continuous-time\nalgorithm [13] to approach extremely low T . At low T , the MC sampling suffers from the slow\nrelaxation due to the severe frustration. To accelerate the relaxation process, we applied the\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nJ\nJ\n\nJ\nFigure 1. Schematic pictures of\nthe transverse-field Ising model\non the checkerboard lattice. (a)\nNeel type order and (b) horizontal stripe order.\n\nloop-flip algorithm developed for frustrated Ising-type spin systems [14, 15]. In our calculations,\nthe loops are formed in the real space at a particular imaginary-time slice, and flipped together\nwith all the spin variables along the imaginary-time direction, i.e., on the torus defined by the\nloop in space and time. In addition, the replica exchange method was used to further suppress\nthe slowing down [16]. For the present system, the replicas are exchanged along a constant-\u0393/T\nline because the Boltzmann weight depends on the number of domain walls in the imaginary-time\ndirection which is proportional to \u0393/T .\nCalculations were done for N = 4 \u00d7 L2 site systems with L = 12 under the periodic boundary\nconditions. Observables were computed typically for 120000 samplings after 30000 steps of\nthermalization. The results were divided into eight bins to evaluate the statistical errors.\n3. Results and discussions\nFigure 2 shows the QMC results for the susceptibility at a relatively weak longitudinal field\nh = 0.4 with varying \u0393.

Figure 2(c)\nshows the local correlation parameter given by \u03c1 = N2 p f (p), where the sum runs over all\nP\nplaquettes. f (p) is a function defined for each plaquette p as f (p) = 1 for i\u2208p szi = 0 and\notherwise f (p) = \u22123/5; \u03c1 \u2192 1 when all the plaquettes satisfy the two-up two-down spin\nconfiguration, and \u03c1 \u2192 0 when the spins are completely disordered, i.e., as T \u2192 \u221e and/or\n\u0393 \u2192 \u221e. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), for weak \u0393 . 0.5, both the susceptibilities increase\nwith decreasing T in Curie-law like behavior, i.e., \u03c7 \u221d T \u22121 . A shoulder-like feature observed\nat T \u223c 0.3 in \u03c7stripe corresponds to a formation of the ice-rule type local configurations, as\nindicated by the saturation of \u03c1 in Fig. 2(c). These behaviors suggest that the system is in\nthe correlated regime with satisfying the local constraint, but remains critical, without choosing\neither Neel or stripe ordering, presumably because of the strong frustration. We also calculate\nthe momentum dependence of the susceptibility, and confirm that it remains featureless without\nshowing any peak in the momentum space. It is surprising that the critical behavior is robustly\nobserved down to very low T \u223c 0.01. This implies that the order-from-disorder mechanism is\nextremely weak or ineffective in this region.

In this region, \u0393 is strong enough to disturb the ice-rule type\nconfigurations [Fig. 2(c)], and the ground state turns into a quantum paramagnetic state.\nWith increasing the longitudinal field, a contrasting behavior between the two susceptibilities\nshows up in the vicinity of phase transition to the quantum paramagnetic state. Figure 3 shows\nthe results at h = 0.9. In the region \u0393 . 0.3, both \u03c7Neel and \u03c7stripe diverge toward T = 0, in\na similar manner to the results for \u0393 . 0.5 in Fig. 2. On the other hand, before entering the\nquantum paramagnetic regime for \u0393 & 0.5 where both \u03c7Neel and \u03c7stripe saturate, a qualitatively\ndifferent behavior is observed: At \u0393 \u223c 0.40, \u03c7stripe begins to deviate from the Curie-law like\nbehavior and tends to saturate, while \u03c7Neel remains to diverge (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3).\nThis implies that the stripe-type fluctuation is suppressed and the Neel-type ordering is likely\nfavored in the low-T limit. Similar behavior is observed in a finite region on the verge of the\nquantum paramagnetic phase for 0.5 < h < 1.0 (see the phase diagram in Fig. 5 below).\n1.0\n\n10 0\n\n(a)\n10 -2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nT\n\n10 0\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n\u0393=0.11\n\u0393=0.21\n\u0393=0.30\n\u0393=0.41\n\u0393=0.51\n\u0393=0.61\n\n0.6\n10 0\n\n10 -1\n\n0.9\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c7 Neel\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u0393=0.11\n\u0393=0.21\n\u0393=0.30\n\u0393=0.41\n\u0393=0.51\n\u0393=0.61\n\n10 2\n\n\u03c7 stripe\n\n\u0393=0.11\n\u0393=0.21\n\u0393=0.30\n\u0393=0.41\n\u0393=0.51\n\u0393=0.61\n\n10 2\n\n(b)\n10 -2\n\n0.5\n10 -1\n\nT\n\n10 0\n\n0.4\n\n(c)\n10 -2\n\n10 -1\n\nT\n\n10 0\n\nFigure 3.

The arrows in (a) and (b)\nindicate a contrasting behavior between \u03c7Neel and \u03c7stripe in the intermediate \u0393 region.\nFor larger longitudinal fields, yet another behavior appears. For h & 1.0, the MC relaxation\nbecomes very slow at low T even with the use of the loop-flip algorithm and the replica-exchange\ntechnique. The situation is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The results show the relaxation of the order\nparameters mNeel and mstripe at h = 1.6 along a constant \u0393/T = tan(85\u25e6 ) axis; the data are\nmeasured for 50000 MC steps after particular thermalization steps of Ntherm starting from the\n\n\finitial configuration with corresponding perfect order: Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the results\nstarting from the perfectly-Neel-ordered state and the perfectly-horizontal-stripe-ordered state,\nrespectively. As shown in Fig. 4, mNeel \u223c 0 after Ntherm = 105 thermalization independent of the\ninitial state. On the other hand, the mstripe shows strong dependence on the initial state even\nafter Ntherm \u223c 105 steps. A possible origin of the freezing behavior is strong first order transition\nto the horizontal-stripe-ordered state. Although the extremely slow relaxation prevents us from\nobtaining numerically-converged results, the results suggest that the system has an instability\ntoward the horizontal stripe ordering at low T in this high-h region.\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\n0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45\n\n0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45\n\n(a)\n\n1.00\n\nNeel, Ntherm =100000\nNeel, Ntherm =150000\nNeel, Ntherm =200000\nStripe, Ntherm =100000\nStripe, Ntherm =150000\nStripe, Ntherm =200000\n\n0.80\n0.60\n\nm 0.40\n\nNeel, Ntherm =100000\nNeel, Ntherm =150000\nNeel, Ntherm =200000\nStripe, Ntherm =100000\nStripe, Ntherm =150000\nStripe, Ntherm =200000\n\n0.80\n0.60\n\nm 0.40\n\n0.20\n0.00\n0.01\n\n(b)\n\n1.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\nT\n\n0.04\n\n0.00\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nT\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nFigure 4.\nT dependence of mNeel and mstripe at h = 1.6 and \u0393/T = tan(85\u25e6 ) for\nvarying thermalization steps Ntherm . (a) is the results starting from the perfectly-Neel-ordered\nconfiguration and (b) is from the perfectly-horizontal-stripe-ordered one.\nSummarizing the results above, we deduce a 'phase diagram' in Fig. 5, which indicates the lowT instability anticipated from the MC data. In the strong longitudinal field region, 1.0 . h . 1.8\nand \u0393 . 0.2, our MC results indicate an instability toward the horizontal-stripe-type ordering\nbelow some particular temperature, as exemplified in Fig. 4(b). Although we could not directly\nconfirm the phase transition because of the extremely slow MC relaxation, we expect this phase\nto appear at a finite temperature. In the intermediate longitudinal field region, 0.5 . h . 1.0\nand 0.3 . \u0393 . 0.5, the results appear to favor the Neel-type instability. The Neel temperature\nappears to be extremely low, less than T = 0.01. In the remaining low-h region for \u0393 . 0.5,\nwe could not observe any sign of clear instability toward either Neel or stripe type, at least for\nT > 0.01; the system is strongly correlated but remains to be critical under the frustration.\nLet us compare the result to the T = 0 argument by Moessner and Sondhi [10]. In the previous\nstudy, by a perturbation in \u0393/h, it was predicted that a Neel-type order occurs in the entire\nregion of our consideration. Our result in Fig. 5 shows a similar tendency in the intermediate\nh, where the Neel-type order appears to be favored. However, we could not detect any sign of\na particular ground state in the lower-h region, although the Neel-type order was expected to\nextend down to h \u2192 0 in the schematic T = 0 phase diagram in the previous study [10]. This\napparent disagreement can be due to very weak degeneracy lifting by the order from disorder\nfor the expected Neel ground state. Another possibility is that, for large \u0393/h, the perturbative\nargument in \u0393/h no longer holds and a different phase emerges in the region. In order to identify\nthe nature of the system in this region, further analysis down to lower T in larger system sizes is\nnecessary. On the other hand, under relatively strong field 1.0 . h . 1.8, we detected instability\ntoward another phase from the slow relaxation behavior, namely, the horizontal-stripe phase.\nThis might be related with the competition in the ground states between the two-up two-down\nNeel order and three-up one-down diagonal-stripe order at h \u2243 2. Our preliminary calculations\n\n\fshow a finite-size effect in this regime; the horizontal-stripe type instability appears to extend to\nslightly lower-h region in larger size systems. More detailed results will be discussed elsewhere.\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\nh\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n\n\u0393\n\nFigure 5.\n'Phase diagram' for the model in\nEq.

Summary\nTo summarize, we have investigated the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations on the\nthermodynamics of the frustrated checkerboard Ising model with transverse and longitudinal\nmagnetic fields. We have examined the magnetic instabilities induced by order-from-disorder\nmechanism by employing a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method with the loop-flip\nupdate and replica exchange algorithm. We identified characteristic behaviors, which were not\ninferred from the previous study for the quantum order from disorder in the ground state. One\nis the instability toward a horizontal-stripe-type ordering in a relatively high longitudinal-field\nregime. This is distinguished from the diagonal stripe predicted for a higher field. The other is no\nclear indication of dominant ordering or fluctuation down to T \u2243 0.01J in a relatively low-field\nregime; the susceptibility shows a persistent Curie-law-like divergence at all the momenta. This\ncould be due to the emergence of a novel state or simply by surprisingly weak order-from-disorder\neffect in the Neel ground state expected in the previous theory.\nH.I. and Y.M. thank T.
