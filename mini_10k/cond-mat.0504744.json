Finally, we discuss the evidence in favor of the presence of a\ntype-A transition temperature for the odd rotational degrees of freedom, distinct from the type-B\ntransition associated with the arrest of the translational and even rotational ones, as predicted by\nthe mode-coupling theory for the glass transition.\nPACS numbers: 64.70.Pf, 61.20.Lc, 61.20.Ja - Version: November 12, 2018\n\nThe ideal mode-coupling theory (MCT) equations have\nbeen recently solved in the site-site representation for a\nsystem of symmetric hard dumbbell molecules [1, 2], as\na function of the packing fraction \u03c6 and the elongation\n\u03b6. Interestingly enough, the theory predicts two different\ndynamic arrest scenarios, on varing \u03c6 and \u03b6 (see Fig. 1\nin Ref. [1]). For large elongations, it is predicted that\nall rotational correlation functions are strongly coupled\nto the translational degrees of freedom and dynamic arrest takes place at a common \u03c6 value, \u03c6B\nc (\u03b6). According\nto MCT, the transition is of type-B, i.e. the long time\nlimit of translational and rotational correlation functions\njumps discontinuosly from zero to a finite value at the\nideal glass transition line. The ideal glass transition line\n(the B-line) has a non-monotonic shape in the \u03c6\u2212\u03b6 plane,\nwith a maximum at \u03b6 = 0.43. The B-line continues for\nsmall elongations until the hard sphere limit at \u03b6 = 0 is\nreached. However, for small elongations \u03b6 < \u03b6c = 0.345,\ntheory predicts a novel different scenario: only the translational and the even rotational degrees of freedom freeze\nat the B-line. Here even and odd refer to the parity of the\norder l of the rotational correlator Cl (t) = hPl (\u00ea(t)*\u00ea(0))i,\nwhere Pl is the Legendre l-polynomial and \u00ea(t) is a unity\nvector along the molecular axis at time t. The odd-l rotational degrees of freedom freeze at higher values of the\nB\npacking fraction, namely at an A-line \u03c6A\nc (\u03b6) > \u03c6c (\u03b6),\nthat merges with the B-line at \u03b6 = \u03b6c . The glass transition of the odd degrees is of type-A, i.e. the long time\nlimit of the odd rotational correlation functions increases\ncontinuously from zero on crossing the A-line.\nThe A- and B-lines separate the \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b6 plane in three\ndynamic regions: an ergodic fluid, a completely arrested\nstate, and an intermediate state (located between the Aand B-lines) which is the amorphous analog of a plastic\ncrystal. In such a state, each molecule remains trapped\nin the cage formed by the neighbouring molecules, but\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\nis able to perform 180o rotations within the cage, which\nlead to relaxation for the odd-l but not for the even-l\nrotational correlators. An analogous scenario is predicted\nby molecular MCT for the case of hard-ellipsoids in the\nlimit of small aspect ratio [3].\nIn order to test these predictions, we have recently carried out molecular dynamics simulations [4] in a binary\nmixture of Lennard-Jones (LJ) dumbbell molecules at\nfixed packing fraction, as a function of the elongation\nusing the temperature T as control parameter (instead\nof \u03c6 used in the theoretical work). In agreement with\nMCT predictions, a non-monotonic dependence on the\nelongation has been observed for the isodiffusivity curves,\nwith a minimum at a value of \u03b6 close to the maximum of\n\u03c6B\nc (\u03b6) [1]. For small elongations \u03b6 \u2264 0.3, in deep supercooled states, the coherent intermediate scattering function evaluated at the maximum of the static structure\nfactor, as well as the rotational correlator C2 (t), decays\nto zero at times several orders of magnitude longer than\nthose for C1 (t). An analysis of the plateau height for the\nC1 (t) correlator shows a sharp drop of the former in the\nrange 0.3 < \u03b6 < 0.5, consistent with the theoretical \u03b6c\nvalue predicted for the hard dumbbell fluid. These features suggest the presence of a nearby type-A transition\nin the investigated LJ dumbbell system.\nSimulations in Ref. [4] have been carried out in\nequilibrium liquid states, for state points above the Btransition, i.e., at T such that translational, and both the\nodd and even rotational degrees of freedom are ergodic.\nIn this manuscript we complement equilibrium simulations and we also investigate the reorientational dynamics\nbelow the B-transition, i.e., in out-of-equilibrium states,\nwhere the translational and even rotational degrees of\nfreedom are arrested. We aim at providing evidence of\nthe type-A transition, and to shed light on the dynamic\nfeatures of amorphous analogs to plastic crystals.\n\n\f2\n3\n\nT\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b6\n\n0.8\n\nFIG. 1: Isodiffusivity lines (thin continuous lines), and \u03c41\n(dotted lines) and \u03c42 (thin dashed lines) isochrones in the T \u03b6 plane.

Thick\ndashed and thick continuous lines are corresponding guides\nfor the eyes.\n\nWe investigate a binary mixture of 410:102 dumbbell\nmolecules [5] in a box of side L with periodic boundary conditions. Each molecule consists of two identical\natoms, denoted by A and B respectively for the most and\nthe less abundant component of the mixture. The interaction between atoms of different molecules is given by\na Lennard-Jones potential plus a linear term: V\u03b1\u03b2 (r) =\n4\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 [(\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 /r)12 \u2212 (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 /r)6 + A0 + A1 (r/\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 )], where \u03b1,\n\u03b2 \u2208 (A, B). The interaction parameters are the same\nof the monoatomic binary mixture of Kob and Andersen\n[6], i.e., \u01ebAA = 1.0, \u01ebAB = 1.5, \u01ebBB = 0.5, \u03c3AA = 1.0,\n\u03c3AB = 0.8, \u03c3BB = 0.88. The values of A0 and A1 are\nselected to guarantee continuity of potential and forces\nat the cutoff distance c\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 , with c = 2.5. The resulting\nvalues are A0 = c\u22126 (7 \u2212 13c\u22126) and A1 = 6c\u22127 (2c\u22126 \u2212 1).\nThe same atomic mass m = 1 is used for both A and B\nparticles (each dumbbell has mass equal to two).\nSimulations have been carried out for elongations \u03b6 =\n0.125, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.55, 0.70 and 0.85 at different\nvalues of T and constant packing fraction \u03c6 = 0.708.\n3\nThe packing fraction is defined by \u03c6 = (\u03c0/6)(NAA \u03c3AA\n+\n3\n\u22123\n3\nNBB \u03c3BB )L [1 + (3/2)\u03b6 \u2212 (1/2)\u03b6 ], where NAA = 410,\nNBB = 102 are the number of AA and BB molecules.\nTemperature, time and diffusion coefficient D are re2\nspectively calculated in units of \u01ebAA /kB , (m\u03c3AA\n/\u01ebAA )1/2\n2\n1/2\nand (\u03c3AA \u01ebAA /m) . Equations of motion are integrated,\n\nwith a time step ranging from 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 according to T and/or \u03b6, using the velocity Verlet scheme\ncombined with the SHAKE algorithm [7] for keeping the\nmolecular elongation constant. At each state point, the\nsystem is thermalized at the requested T by periodic velocity rescaling. A microcanonical run is performed after\nsuitable equilibration to generate a representative trajectory in phase space. Statistical averages are performed\nover 20 independently generated equilibrium trajectories.\nAt high T , the thermalization process is started from\na distorted crystalline configuration that quickly melts.\nAt low T , it is started from equilibrated high T configurations. After reaching equilibrium, energy or pressure show no drift. Also, translational and rotational\nmean squared displacements as well as dynamic correlation functions, show no aging, i.e. there is no systematic\ndependence of the dynamical properties from the selected\ntime origin. In practice equilibration requires that each\ndumbbell, in average, has moved several diameters and\nperformed several full rotations from its initial position.\nAt very low T and small \u03b6, relaxation times for translational an even rotational degrees of freedom become\nexceedingly long for the time scale of the simulation. In\nthese conditions only the odd rotational degrees of freedom decay to zero. We perform long runs of \u2248 107 steps\nuntil neither significant drift in T and pressure, nor aging\nin the translational and even rotational correlation functions is observed, to ensure that the residual rotational\nmotion of the dumbbells takes place in an essentially\nfrozen structure [8]. After this preliminary simulation,\ntrajectories are calculated.\nFig. 1 shows data for D and for the relaxation times\n\u03c41 , \u03c42 of the rotational correlators C1 (t) and C2 (t). The\ndiffusion coefficient is evaluated from the long time limit\nof the mean square displacement, while \u03c41 and \u03c42 are defined as the time at which the corresponding correlation\nfunctions decay to 3 % of their initial value. As previously done in the analysis of other systems characterized\nby slow dynamics [4, 9], we report isochrones (constant\n\u03c4l ) and isodiffusivity (constant D) curves, to provide an\nindication of the shape of the glass line in the (T \u2212 \u03b6)\nplane. The isodiffusivity curves are consistent with the\nsame quantities calculated in Ref. [4] and, as previously\nnoted, show a mimimum around \u03b6 = 0.55, close to the\nMCT prediction for hard dumbbells [1]. Fig. 1 shows\nthat, especially at low T , the iso-\u03c42 curves follow the\nsame trend as the isodiffusivity curves, tending to collapse in a common curve, as expected on approaching a\ntype-B transition. The iso-\u03c41 curves show a similar trend\nonly at large \u03b6. On the contrary, for small elongations\nthe iso-\u03c41 curves depart from the iso-D and iso-\u03c42 curves.\nDifferently from \u03c42 , within the resolution in \u03b6 of our calculations, the \u03c41 isochrones are monotonic in the T \u2212 \u03b6\nplane. The fact that the iso-\u03c41 curves lay significantly\nbelow the iso-\u03c42 curves shows very clearly that fast relaxation of the odd degrees of freedom takes place even\nwhen the even degrees are arrested.\nA detailed quantitative comparison of the presented re-\n\n\f3\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nD\n10\n10\n\n-3\n\n\u03b6 = 0.125\n\u03b6 = 0.20\n\u03b6 = 0.30\n\u03b6 = 0.40\n\u03b6 = 0.55\n\u03b6 = 0.70\n\u03b6 = 0.85\n\n-4\n\n10\n10\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6 T 8 10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c41\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\n\n10\n10\n\n\u03b6 = 0.125\n\u03b6 = 0.20\n\u03b6 = 0.30\n\u03b6 = 0.40\n\u03b6 = 0.55\n\u03b6 = 0.70\n\u03b6 = 0.85\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03b6 = 0.20\n\u03b6 = 0.30\n\u03b6 = 0.40\n\u03b6 = 0.55\n\u03b6 = 0.70\n\u03b6 = 0.85\n\n4\n\n\u03c42\n\n10\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n\n1/T 5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 T\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: Symbols: Temperature dependence of D, \u03c41 and \u03c42 .\nContinuous lines are fits to VFT functions (see text). Dashed\nlines are Arrhenius fits. Data for \u03c41 have been represented vs.\n1/T in order to evidence the small \u03b6 Arrhenius behavior.\n\nsults with MCT predictions for dynamic exponents and\nscaling laws can not be simply performed, except for large\n\u03b6. Indeed, it has been shown that the range of validity\nof the asymptotic MCT laws - for the small \u03b6 hard\ndumbbell fluid case [2] - is limited to unusually small\nB\nvalues of the separation parameter \u01eb = (\u03c6B\nc \u2212 \u03c6)/\u03c6c .\nIn particular, the exponent \u03b3 for the well-known power\n\u03b3\nlaw D, 1/\u03c4 \u221d (\u03c6B\nc \u2212 \u03c6) can only be correctly estimated\nby exploring the range \u01eb < 10\u22122 . For small \u03b6, a fit\nof data in the range 10\u22122 < \u01eb < 10\u22121 would show an\napparent power law behavior, but the corresponding fit\nwould yield an \"effective\" exponent, which contrary to\nthe asymptotic limit, would not take a universal value,\nbut would depend on the chosen observable [2]. A similar\nphenomenon is expected to be present in the studied system at small \u03b6, preventing the possibility of an accurate\ndetermination of the asymptotic laws close to the MCT\ncritical temperature TcB . In addition, we recall that ideal\n\nMCT neglects activated processes which are known to be\npresent in reality around and below TcB [10]. Only when\nhopping phenomena can be neglected, an MCT study can\nbe feasible very close to TcB .\nFig. 2 shows the T dependence of D, \u03c41 and \u03c42 for\nseveral \u03b6 values. If a fit (not shown) of the T dependence\nof D and 1/\u03c42 according to the functional form (T \u2212TcB )\u03b3\nis performed, we obtain very similar values of TcB for\nboth quantities in all the \u03b6 range (see Fig. 1). For the\ncase of 1/\u03c41 , reasonable power-law fits can be performed\nonly for \u03b6 & 0.4. For \u03b6 = 0.55 fits provide values of\nTcB consistent with those obtained for D and 1/\u03c42 but\nwith different \u03b3 values. Only for \u03b6 \u2265 0.70 a simultaneous\nconsistent description for D, 1/\u03c41 and 1/\u03c42 is achieved,\nwith identical TcB and \u03b3 values. Specifically TcB = 0.732,\n\u03b3 = 2.50 for \u03b6 = 0.70 and TcB = 1.02, \u03b3 = 2.06 for\n\u03b6 = 0.85.\nTo provide a lower bound to TcB at small \u03b6, we also\nfit the data in terms of the well-known phenomenological Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) law D, 1/\u03c41,2 \u221d\nexp[\u2212A/(T \u2212 TV F T )], which predicts a dynamic arrest\nof the corresponding degree of freedom at a finite temperature TV F T < TcB [10]. In all cases, the VFT law\nprovides a consistent effective representation of the dynamics, with a fit quality comparable to the MCT power\nlaw fit. The resulting TV F T (\u03b6) for D, \u03c41 and \u03c42 are reported in Fig. 1. Interestingly, TV F T for D, \u03c41 and \u03c42\ncoincide for large elongations, indicating strong couplings\nbetween the translational and all the rotational degrees\nof freedom. However, for \u03b6 . 0.4 the TV F T for \u03c41 is\nmuch smaller than the TV F T for D and \u03c42 , confirming\nthat around this value of \u03b6 the odd degrees of freedom\ncompletely decouple form the even and from the translational ones. This latter value of \u03b6 is consistent with the\nmerging point of the A- and B-transitions for the hard\ndumbbell fluid [1] and with estimates of Ref. [4]. At\nsmaller elongations \u03b6 \u2264 0.3, for \u03c41 we find TV F T \u2248 0.\nThis implies that a good description of the data is provided by an Arrhenius law \u03c41 \u221d exp(E/kB T ) (see Fig. 2).\nThe activation energies E/\u01ebAA = 1.8, 3.3 and 5.0, respectively for \u03b6= 0.125, 0.20 and 0.30, roughly follow a linear\ndependence on \u03b6. The presence of an activated Arrhenius\nT dependence in \u03c41 (T ) for small molecular elongations,\nstrongly suggests that the residual reorientational dynamics at very low temperatures, in the T -region where\nthe translational dynamics is already arrested, is characterized by 180o rotations which do not lead to relaxation\nof the even rotational degrees of freedom. The Arrhenius\nfunctional form also suggests that hopping phenomena\nare extremely relevant, so much to completely mask the\npresence of a finite type-A glass transition temperature,\nif the analysis is limited only to the T dependence of \u03c41\n(or any other odd \u03c4 ).\nWhile we can not expect, due to this intense hopping\ndecorrelation, to observe any critical law, indication of\na residual cross-over finite temperature can still be observed in the full dependence of the correlation functions,\nand in particular in the strength of the long time \u03b1 relax-\n\n\f4\n1\nC2(t)\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n1\nC3(t)\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 T1/2t 10\n\nFIG. 3: Temperature dependence of the rotational correlators\nC2 (t) and C3 (t) vs. time rescaled by T 1/2 , for elongation\n\u03b6 = 0.2.

The main effect of hopping is indeed manifested in the long time decay from the plateau value. Indeed, in the absence of these additional relaxation channels, the correlation function would decay only down to\nthe plateau value. Fig. 3 shows, for \u03b6 = 0.2, the T dependence of C2 (t) and C3 (t), in a wide range of T ,\n(across TV T F = 0.96 for \u03c42 ). Though C1 (t) has more\nexperimental relevance, C3 (t) is more adequate to discuss the behavior of the non-ergodicity parameter, since\nit shows a more pronounced plateau. A representation\nof Ci (t) vs. tT 1/2 , i.e rescaling the time by the thermal\nvelocity, yields a clearer visualization of the decay of the\ncorrelation function. Data reported in Fig. 3 show two\nimportant features:\n(i) at low T the plateau height (i.e., the non-ergodicity\nfactor) for both C2 and C3 progressively grows up, signaling a crossing of the critical MCT temperatures. However, while in case of C2 (t), the increase of the plateau\n\n[1] S.-H. Chong and W. G\u00f6tze, Phys. Rev. E 65, 041503\n(2002).\n[2] S.-H. Chong and W. G\u00f6tze, Phys. Rev.

This fact\nevidences that hopping processes restore ergodicity for\nreorientations at T far below the temperature at which\nthe plateau value starts to increase from zero. (ii) The\ndecay of the C2 correlation function is characterized by\na finite T interval in which the plateau value is essentially constant (within the present numerical error). For\nsmaller T , the height of the plateau starts to increase, as\ndiscussed above. Instead, the decay of the C3 correlation\nfunction is not characterized by any plateau at high T ,\nand the increase of the plateau starts from zero, consistently with the presence of a type-A transition which, due\nto the hopping effects, is significantly weakened. Moreover, the first T at which the C3 plateau value is different\nfrom zero is lower than the T at which the C2 plateau\nstarts to increase. This suggests that the type-A transition temperature is different and lower than the type-B\nTcB . We also note that the \u03b1-relaxation process for odd\nCi is highly stretched, which might reflect the local cage\nheterogeneity.\nIn summary, we have provided evidence for the existence of the type-A transition predicted by MCT for the\nreorientational dynamics of glass-forming liquids of small\nmolecular elongation. Our numerical results complement\nthose recently reported for T > TcB in Ref. [4]. By\ncomputing relaxation times and plateau heights of odd\nrotational dynamic correlators - in the arrested state\nfor the even rotational and the translational degrees of\nfreedom- we show that reorientational hopping dominates the dynamics and restores ergodicity down to temperatures far below the type-A transition. Though these\nresults have been specifically obtained for a liquid of symmetric dumbbells, experimental techniques probing C1 (t)\nand C2 (t), at very low temperatures, will yield qualitatively similar results for small elongated molecules with\na weak asymmetry which disfavours rotations different\nfrom \u2248 180o . Finally, the present model can become a\ntest case for developing theories of the glass transition\nin which activated processes - which become relevant\naround and below TcB - can be studied.\nMIUR-FIRB is acknowledged for financial support.\n\nof Liquids, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK (1997).\n[8] In principle, signifficant aging effects for translational and\neven rotational degrees of freedom could be observed for\nmuch longer simulation times, beyond the limit of current\ncomputational resources.\n[9] E.
