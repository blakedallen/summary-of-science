VoIP has the\ncapability of connecting people over packet switched networks\ninstead of traditional circuit switched networks. Recently, the\nInterAsterisk Exchange Protocol (IAX) has emerged as a new\nVoIP which is gaining popularity among VoIP products. IAX is\nknown for its simplicity, NAT-friendliness, efficiency, and\nrobustness. More recently, the Real time Switching (RSW)\ncontrol criterion has emerged as a multimedia conferencing\nprotocol. In this paper, we made a comparative evaluation and\nanalysis of IAX and RSW using Mean Opinion Score rating\n(MOS) and found that they both perform well under different\nnetwork packet delays in ms.\n\nexisting telephony systems. The protocol is published as IETF\nRFC 2543 and currently has the status of a proposed standard.\nSIP is growing in popularity due to its capability to easily\ncombine voice and IP-based services. IAX is an interesting\nalternative besides communication protocols, which is used\nnowadays by service providers in their conversational service\nofferings (e.g., H.323 and SIP). It is used for both signaling and\nmedia-control operations. Moreover, it provides interesting\nfeatures such as management of signaling and media transfer.\nIAX is a simple protocol which has the capability of avoiding\nNAT traversal complications. Further, there are many features\n[2] that the IAX protocol offers, which are unavailable in other\nexistent VoIP signaling protocols.\n\nKeywords-VoIP; MOS; InterAsterisk eXchange Protocol and\nReal Time Switching Control Criteria.\n\nThe RSW Control Criteria is based on bandwidth reduction\ntechniques [3]. The RSW Multimedia Conference is comprised\nof the conference chairman, participants, and passive observers.\nThe chairman of the conference is the organizer of the\nconference, while the other conference members can be\nparticipants, passive observers, or simply observers. The\nobjective of this article is to experimentally study and analyze\nIAX protocol performance, and compare it with RSW. An\nexperimental study on live VoIP traffic was carried out using\nAsterisk open-source PBX, and for RSW, a Multimedia\nConferencing System called MCS was employed [4].\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nVoice over IP (VoIP) is an Internet Protocol (IP) telephony\nthat facilitates the delivery of voice packets over the Internet.\nVoIP sends voice information in digital form in discrete\npackets rather than use the traditional circuit-switched\nprotocols of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\nITU-T recommendation H.323 [1] was the first standard for\nInternet telephony. Among the widely used and available VoIP\nprotocols are Session Initialization Protocol (SIP), H.323, and\nIAX. The H.323 standard, approved in 1996 by the ITU Study\nGroup 15, specifies the technical requirements for media and\ndata communication in packet-based networks. H.323 is used\nfor developing real-time multimedia communication, such as\naudio and video conferencing, over packet-switched networks.\nNetwork-based audio and video conferencing has established\nitself as an important element in the VoIP industry. H.323 is an\numbrella specification because it includes various other ITU\nstandards. The components under H.323 architecture are endpoint terminals, gatekeeper, and multipoint control unit (MCU).\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol for\ninitiating, managing, and terminating voice and video sessions\nacross packet networks. SIP is being developed by the SIP\nWorking Group within the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF). SIP sessions involve one or more participants and can\nuse unicast or multicast communication. SIP is a protocol that\ninherits a lot of its designs from HTTP and SMTP. SIP can be\nextended to accommodate extra features and services such as\ncall control services, mobility, and interoperability with\n\nII.\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY: IAX AND RSW\n\nWe already proposed the concept of interworking between\nthese two protocols to maximize return on current investments\n[5]. We compare these to services in terms of signaling and\nmedia translation. In the following sub-sections, we analyze\ntheir differences, which are believed to be more important.\nA. Signaling\nThe signaling session is the first to be performed by any\nVoIP protocol before transmission of any media types, and it is\none of the most important functions in the VoIP infrastructure.\nThis is because it allows various network components to\ncommunicate with one another, to set up, and to tear down\ncalls.\nAs shown in Table 1, to initiate a conference or to invite for\na conference in RSW, the CREATE signal is used. CREATE\ncan also be used describe the media types to be used during a\nconference. The RSW server extracts the CREATE signal and\n\n250\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 6, No. 3, 2009\nTABLE I.\n\nFONT SIZES FOR PAPERS\n\nSignals\n\nUsage\n\nCREATE\n\nTo create session\n\nJOIN\n\nTo join session\n\nLEAVE\n\nTo leave session\n\nEND\n\nTo end session\n\nACK\n\nAcks'\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nWe used Asterisk for our experimental study, open source\nsoftware based on PBX, which supports all VoIP protocols\nalong with many voice codec.\nA. Method for Quality Assessment\nIP-based communication technologies are progressing\nrapidly, so it is very important to assess them in terms of QoS\nfor diagnostic system design, and effective network layouts [6].\nTo measure network performance, we used the Mean\nOpinion Score (MOS) rating, which is the most widely used\nassessment technique. It is standardized by ITU-T in\nRecommendation P.800 [9]. The listening subjects were given\na scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = bad, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good,\nand 5 = excellent [7].\n\nsends the invitation call to the destination endpoint. The\ndestination replies with JOIN, REJECT, or BUSY. The\nparticipant can leave the conference by sending LEAVE. Only\nthe Chairman is allowed to END the conference.\nTable 2 shows the IAX protocol sessions between the IAX\nendpoints. The initial singling process starts with a NEW\nmessage indicating the destination number. The remote peer\ncan respond with either a credentials challenge (AUTHREQ), a\nREJECT message, or an ACCEPT message. The AUTHREQ\nmessage indicates the permitted authentication schemes and\nSHOULD result in the sending of an AUTHREP message with\nthe requested credentials. The REJECT message indicates that\nthe call cannot be established at this time. ACCEPT indicates\nthat the call leg between these two peers is established.\nTypically, the first call control message is RINGING, but a\nPROCEEDING message MAY precede it or the call MAY\nproceed directly to the ANSWER message.\n\nB. Experimental Setup\nFigure 1 shows the experimental set-up used to conduct the\nstudy. Both the servers RSW and Asterisk are running on a\nsingle Linux machine. To induce delay in the used network, we\nused netem, a network emulation tool for testing protocol\nbehavior by emulating the property of a wide area network.\nNetem emulates the variable delay, duplication, and reordering\nof network packets, but we e used network delay option only.\nOur experiments focused on comparing the performance of\nRSW and IAX in the presence of packet delay. To examine\nquality effects due to packet delay, both protocols were\ncompared with a fixed packet delay ranging from 0 to 2000 ms\nwith increments of 25 ms. As Figure 2 indicates, the IAX\nprotocol performs slightly better in the presence of fixed packet\ndelay.\n\nThe RSW and IAX signaling techniques appear to be\nrelatively similar in nature. The messages for both protocols\ncan be grouped into two categories: \"requests\" and \"responses\"\n[5].\nB. Media\nRSW and IAX have very different approaches for\nsupporting the exchange of media packets. In the case of realtime transmission of voice or video, the commonly used media\ntransfer protocol is RTP. Once the singling session is\nestablished, RSW makes RTP take the responsibility of\ntransferring media data. Meanwhile, IAX uses UDP for both\nsignaling and data, and it employs mini frame architecture to\nsend media data between the ongoing media conference. These\nmini-frames only have a 4-byte header which is composed of\nthe source call number and the lower two octets of the\ntimestamp.\nTABLE II.\n\nIAX SIGNALING MESSAGES\n\nSignals\n\nUsage\n\nNEW\n\nTo place call\n\nAUTHREQ\n\nTo authenticate\n\nACCEPT\n\nTo accept call leg\n\nPROCEEDING\n\nProceed to join\n\nRINGING\n\nRing at destination\n\nAnswer\n\nIn Call\n\nFigure 1.

We\npresented comparative studies on IAX and RSW in the\npresence of packet delay in the network. Our experimental\nresults showed that both IAX and RSW perform better in\nnetwork delays. This is due to IAX's mini frame architecture\nwhich gave a slight edge to IAX when the network delay is in\nthe range of 1425 to 1925. In order to cross-check our\nexperimental setup and results, further research on IAX and\nRSW control criteria protocols and their performance under\nvarious conditions is recommended.\n\nTat-Chee Wan received his BSEE and MSECE from\nUniversity of Miami, FL in 1990 and 993\nrespectively, and his Ph.D from Universiti Sains\nMalaysia, Penang, Malaysia, in 2005.
