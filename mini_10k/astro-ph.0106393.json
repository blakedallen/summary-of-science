This sample\nwas selected to test the reliablility of mass estimates derived using optical emission\nlinewidths, particularly for the blue compact star-forming galaxies observed at intermediate redshifts (0.1 < z < 1). In addition, we also measure the H i content and gas\n1\n\nHubble Fellow\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ndepletion timescales for the nearby blue, compact galaxies in an attempt to infer the\npresent nature and possible future evolution of their intermediate redshift analogs. We\ndetected H i in 10 of 11 sample galaxies. They have H i masses of 0.3\u20134\u00d7109 M\u2299 , H i\nlinewidths, W20 , of 133\u2013249 km s\u22121 , dynamical masses of 0.5\u20135\u00d71010 M\u2299 , gas depletion timescales, \u03c4gas , of 0.3\u20137 Gyr, H i mass fractions of 0.01\u20130.58, and mass-to-light\nratios of 0.1\u20130.8. These values span the range of values typical of nearby H ii galaxies, irregulars and spirals. Despite the restricted morphological selection, our sample\nof galaxies is quite heterogeneous in terms of H i content, dynamical mass, and gas\ndepletion timescale. Therefore, these galaxies have a variety of evolutionary paths and\nshould look very different from each other in 5 Gyr. Those with high masses and gas\ndepletion timescales are likely to retain their ISM for future star formation while the\nlower mass objects with small gas depletion timescales may be undergoing their last\nmajor event of star-formation. Hence, the fading of intermediate-redshift luminous blue\ncompact galaxies into NGC205-type spheroidals is a viable evolutionary scenario, but\nonly for the least massive, most gas-poor objects in this sample.\nThe most consistent characteristic of our morphologically-selected sample is that\n20 (H ii)\n, are systematically\nthe ratios of H ii linewidths to H i 21 cm linewidths, R= W\nW20 (H i)\nless than unity, with an average value of R=0.66\u00b10.16; similar to findings for local\nH ii galaxies. The simplest explanation for this result is that the ionized gas is more\ncentrally concentrated than the neutral gas within the gravitational potential. We find\nthat R is a function of linewidth, such that smaller linewidth galaxies have smaller values\nof R. Correcting optical linewidths by this factor not only raises the derived masses\nof these galaxies, but also makes them consistent with the local luminosity\u2013linewidth\n(Tully-Fisher) relation as well. If this ratio applies to intermediate-redshift galaxies,\nthen the masses of intermediate redshift blue compact galaxies can be obtained from\noptical linewidths after applying a small correction factor, and the proposed luminosity\nevolution of the Tully-Fisher relation is much smaller and more gradual than suggested\nby studies using optical emission line width measurements.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope and the new generation of 8 m class telescopes have extended our\nknowledge of the early Universe by identifying galaxies down to magnitudes B\u223c28 and redshifts\nz\u22653 (see review by Ellis 1997). A current challenge is to understand the evolutionary connection\nbetween distant galaxies and their nearby counterparts. One approach is to compare fundamental\ngalaxy parameters (i.e., sizes, masses, luminosities) of distant samples with better-studied nearby\ncounterparts to help understand the harder-to-observe distant objects and establish evolutionary\nconnections to present-day galaxies.\nStudies of high redshift galaxies have revealed a population of compact, luminous galaxies\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwith high star formation rates (e.g., Steidel, et al. 1996a; 1996b, Lowenthal et al. 1997). At\nintermediate redshifts, apparently similar sources have been called by various names, including\n\"Compact Narrow Emission Line Galaxies\" (CNELG; Koo et al. 1994; 1995; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1996,\n1998), \"Blue Nucleated Galaxies\" (BNG; Schade et al. 1995), and faint, compact galaxies (Guzm\u00e1n\net al. 1997; Phillips et al. 1997) depending on what properties are being emphasized, and how the\nsamples were selected. It is worth noting that the term \"Narrow\" in the context of CNELG is\nwith respect to QSOs and AGN; the CNELGs themselves display a range of kinematic emission\nline-widths between 30 and 130 km s\u22121 .\nJangren et al. (2001) have compared several of the brighter of the above intermediate-redshift\nsamples. They find that while the sources display a range of photometric properties, most of the\ngalaxies can be isolated quantitatively on the basis of their colors and image structure parameters\nas a class distinct from normal Hubble-types found in bright samples. They define one such class\nas \"Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies\" (LBCGs). Sources in this class have small sizes, high\nluminosities (hence high surface-brightness), and very blue colors. Their image concentration and\nasymmetry is slightly higher than for nearby irregular galaxies included in bright samples. However,\nthis class of galaxies is not defined by their emission-line kinematic widths.\nThe nature and evolution of the LBCG class at intermediate redshift are currently major\nissues under debate. The most comprehensive studies of the LBCG population at intermediate\nredshift to date are those of Phillips et al. (1997) and Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1997). They concluded\nthat the LBCG class is populated by a mixture of starburst galaxies. About 60% of galaxies in\ntheir sample are classified as \"HII-like\" since they are similar to today's population of luminous,\nyoung, star-forming HII galaxies. The remaining \u223c40% are classified as \"SB disk-like\" since they\nform a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts similar to local starburst spiral and irregular\ngalaxies. This classification is consistent with the results published for other LBCG samples in the\nliterature. For instance, Koo et al. (1994, 1995) and Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1996, 1998) first established the\nassociation between HII galaxies and LBCGs for their sample of CNELGs. Alternatively, Mall\u00e9nOrnelas et al. (1999) and Hammer et al. (2000), have concluded that their LBCG samples can be\nbest identified with bright irregulars, late-type spirals or even more massive spirals with a very\nyoung bulge.\nGiven the diverse nature of the LBCG population, it is most likely that they will not evolve\ninto one homogeneous galaxy class. Rather, different LBCGs may evolve into different galaxy\nclasses. There are two main evolutionary scenarios currently discussed in the literature. Koo et al.\n(1994) and subsequent authors have suggested that some subset of the most compact HII-type\nLBCGs at intermediate redshifts may be the progenitors of local low-mass elliptical galaxies (also\ncalled spheroidals), such as NGC 205. Their conjecture is based on the similarity of the kinematic\nwidths and sizes of the LBCGs with low-mass ellipticals. Evolutionary models predict that, in 4-6\nGyr of passive evolution, the faded luminosities and surface brightnesses of HII-type LBCGs will\nmatch local low-mass ellipticals. This evolutionary prediction requires that LBCGs are undergoing\ntheir last major burst of star formation at a z\u223c0.4. In order to match the low luminosities of\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nlow-mass elliptical galaxies, star formation in HII-type LBCGs must be short-lived (timescales \u223c 1\nGyr or less) so that they fade by \u223c2-4 magnitudes in \u223c4-6 Gyr (Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1998). Since local\nlow-mass ellipticals have little detectable cool gas (Young & Lo 1997; Young 2000), this prediction\nalso requires HII-type LBCGs to lose nearly all of their gas by the present day. Alternatively, the\nevolutionary scenario for SB disk-like LBCGs currently being considered is very different. Some\nauthors have suggested that these LBCGs may actually be disks forming from the center outward\nto become present-day spirals (Phillips et al. 1997; Hammer et al. 2000). Thus SB disk-like LBCGs\nwould be more massive than inferred from their virial masses since their small sizes and kinematic\nemission-line widths would reflect mainly the central starburst region (Phillips et al. 1997; Barton\n& Van Zee 2001). These objects are also expected to have large reservoirs of gas that may allow\nfor continuing star formation, albeit at a lower rate than the current burst.\nMeasurements of the 21 cm neutral hydrogen (H i) linewidth and flux may provide an important new constraint on the evolution of LBCGs. The H i linewidth is a very good indicator of the\nrotational velocity of a galaxy, provided the system is not severely distorted or interacting. We can\nuse this rotational velocity to obtain a total enclosed mass of the system, a parameter that will not\nchange dramatically with time (at least over the past few gigayears), unlike the star formation rate\nor luminosity. H i measurements typically trace gas out to a larger radius than the optical emission\nlines and, hence, offer a more robust measurement of the mass. An integrated HI line flux, coupled\nwith an adopted distance, provides a measure of the total neutral hydrogen mass which limits a\ngalaxy's potential for future star formation. The H i mass and a known star formation rate (SFR)\nhelp set limits on the timescale for the reservoir of neutral gas to be depleted.\nSince neutral hydrogen observations of the intermediate redshift LBCGs are not yet possible,\nwe must infer their properties from nearby analogs. This is possible provided the nearby sample is\nrepresentative of the more distant LBCGs. If observations imply that one of our analogs has a small\nH i linewidth, a small quantity of neutral gas, and a short gas depletion timescale, then the case\nis strengthened for it being a low-mass object which will shortly cease star formation and undergo\nsubsequent passive evolution. If, on the other hand, observations imply a large H i linewidth, a\nlarge reservoir of neutral gas, and a long gas depletion timescale, then the analog would appear\nto be a higher-mass galaxy. A long period of passive evolution following the end of the current\nstarburst would seem less likely and the galaxy may continue having subsequent events of star\nformation.\nBecause we wish to consider sources which span a range of luminosities from \"dwarf\" (MB >\n\u221218) to \"luminous\" (MB < \u221218), we adopt here the more generic term Blue Compact Galaxy\n(BCG) to encompass this diverse group of small, blue galaxies regardless of luminosity or kinematics.\nThroughout this paper, we will use the sample of compact galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field flanking\nfields (HDF-ff; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1997; Phillips et al. 1997), intermediate redshift CNELGs (Koo et al.\n1994, 1995; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1996), and the BNGs of Schade et al. (1995) as a benchmark for assessing\na population of local compact galaxies. We will refer to these previous samples collectively as the\nintermediate-redshift BCGs.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nAnother issue relating to the study of intermediate redshift galaxies that we will examine\nconcerns the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation and its evolution. Specifically, studies of the internal\nkinematics of intermediate redshift galaxies have led to discrepant results on the evolution of the\nT-F zeropoint. For example, Forbes et al. (1996), Rix et al. (1997), Simard & Pritchet (1998),\nand Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. (1999) all find between 1 and 2 magnitudes of brightening in the T-F at\nredshifts of 0.2-0.8. These surveys rely on [OII] or [OIII] & H\u03b2 emission-lines as kinematic tracers;\nall except Simard & Pritchet measure spatially integrated line-widths. In contrast, studies using\nresolved rotation curves at intermediate redshifts (Vogt et al. 1996, 1997; Bershady et al. 1999)\nfind much less brightening (0-0.6 mag) over a range of redshift between 0.1 to 1. Many of these\nstudies specifically target blue galaxies, some of which undoubtedly are BCGs by virtue of their\nstrong emission lines and high surface-brightness.\nOne question that has arisen is whether the spatially-integrated line-widths of optical emission\nlines used in some studies under-estimate the true rotation velocities. Indeed, Forbes et al. (1996)\nnote that in two cases where they have resolved rotation curves, their line-widths under-estimate\nthe true rotation speed by 2% and 41%, respectively. Complicating the issue is the fact that\nthe different studies select heterogeneously from the distant galaxy population (Bershady 1997). If\ndifferent galaxies evolve at different rates, the measured evolution in the T-F zeropoint may depend\non galaxy types sampled, as suggested by Simard & Pritchet (1998). They find tentative evidence\nthat the least-massive (slowest rotators) brighten most. While they have measured rotation-curves\n(albeit at limited spatial resolution and low S/N), the sense of this observation is the same as would\nresult from the systematic under-estimate of true line-width based on optical measurements. We\nare in a position here to address the reliability of internal kinematics based on spatially-integrated,\noptical emission line-widths, as well as the conclusions drawn from these measurements.\nIn this paper we are presenting H i and H ii spectroscopy, as well as R-band imaging, of 11\nnearby BCGs drawn from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) emission-line survey\n(Zamorano et al. 1994). These galaxies were selected to morphologically resemble the BCG population at intermediate redshift. In section 2 we present the sample selection criteria, observing\nprocedure, and reductions. Section 3 contains the analysis of the data. In section 4 we present\nour sample galaxies. We discuss the implications of our observations for the inherent nature of\nBCGs in section 5, and we conclude in section 6. We adopt H0 = 70 km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 and q0 = 0.05\nthroughout this paper.\n\n2.\n\nData & Observations\n\n2.1.\n\nSample Selection\n\nMost BCGs at intermediate redshifts (z \u223c 0.4) that have been discussed in the literature are\nintrinsically luminous objects (MB < \u221218 mag), with blue rest-frame colors (B \u2212 V < 0.45, B \u2212\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nr < 0.6), and compact in the sense that they have high effective B-band surface brightnesses2\n(SBe < 21.5 mag arcsec\u22122 ). For this study, we chose galaxies which would be nearby analogs to\nintermediate-z BCGs. Sample galaxies were chosen from the UCM emission line survey of star\nforming galaxies (Zamorano et al. 1994; 1996) based on data from the original survey, followup optical spectroscopy (Gallego et al. 1996; 1997) and optical photometry (Vitores et al. 1996a;\n1996b; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000). The survey preferentially selects objects with large H\u03b1 emission\nline equivalent widths, EW > 50\u00c5. Four physical parameters were used to identify the nearby\ncounterparts to the objects observed at intermediate redshift: luminosity, color, velocity dispersion\n(\u03c3) of the optical emission lines, and effective radius. The criteria were chosen to exclude very\nlow luminosity systems and Blue Compact Dwarfs, in the classical sense (MB \u2265 -17.0), to include\nobjects with blue color, B \u2212 r \u2264 1.0, and those with small sizes, Ref f \u2264 2.0 kpc, and small velocity\ndispersions, \u03c3H ii < 80 km s\u22121 . The important constraint is that our sample galaxies have visible\nproperties similar to BCGs at higher redshifts. We further restricted the sample to objects with\ndeclinations between -1\u25e6 and +38\u25e6 in order that they be observable from Arecibo. From this limited\nsample we chose 11 galaxies, which tended to have the smallest velocity dispersions. Table 1 lists\nthe targets selected for observation, their positions, and the time-on-source, along with alternate\nidentifiers and comments.\nIn Figure 1 we compare the luminosity, color, size, and surface brightness of the 11 UCM sample\ngalaxies (filled circles) with intermediate redshift BCGs from the Hubble Deep Field flanking fields\n(open triangles; denoted HDF-ff; Phillips et al. 1997; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1997) and with a sample of\nBCGs (open boxes, including the Compact Narrow Emission Line Galaxies of Koo et al. 1994, 1995\nand the Blue Nucleated Galaxies of Schade et al. (1995)). The polygons (from Phillips et al. 1997,\nfigure 8) illustrate the approximate location of nearby elliptical, spiral, irregular, and spheroidal\ngalaxies. Figure 1 demonstrates that our sample galaxies have similar surface brightnesses, absolute\nmagnitudes, and colors to the intermediate redshift BCGs from the literature. In addition, our\ngalaxies have surface brightnesses more similar to low-mass ellipticals and high-mass spheroidals\nthan to massive spirals or irregulars. Some of the targets are on the border between these two\nclasses of objects. While our galaxies do not occupy the full range of parameter space that the\nintermediate redshift BCGs do, they are sampling a significant subset of the BCG properties. Our\ngalaxies cover almost the full range of luminosities and colors as the intermediate-z BCGs, but\nare only comparable to the smallest of the distant BCGs (with SBe \u223c20 mag arcsec\u22122 ). These\nlimitations must be remembered when we compare our sample galaxies with their more distant\ncounterparts.\n2\n\nSBe = 5\u00d7log[Ref f (kpc)]+MB +38.6. This is the average surface brightness inside the half-light radius, equivalent\nto the effective radius for a r1/4 profile.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n2.2.\n\nH i Observations\n\nHI observations of the 11 sample galaxies were made using the Arecibo3 305 m telescope on 1999\nOctober 14-16. We observed from 2200-0400 LST each day using the 1.4 GHz feed in conjunction\nwith the L-narrow and L-wide receivers. The L-wide receiver was only used for observations of UCM\n0135+2242, while the L-narrow receiver was used for the remaining 10 galaxies. This configuration\nhas a beamwidth of 3.\u2032 4\u00d73.\u2032 8 (79\u00d788 kpc for a typical galaxy distance of 80 Mpc) and a measured\ngain of 10 K Jy\u22121 . The system temperature has been measured at 32 K for the L-narrow receiver\nand 38 K for the L-wide receiver. We observed in 4 IFs, recording data in two separate bandwidths\nin both polarizations simultaneously. We observed with bandwidths of 12.5 MHz and 25 MHz with\n9-level sampling. This yields a velocity coverage of \u223c2500 km s\u22121 and \u223c5000 km s\u22121 , respectively.\nWith 2048 channels for each IF, the velocity resolution is 1.3 km s\u22121 and 2.6 km s\u22121 , respectively.\nBecause the different subcorrelators are not fully independent, we could not combine the two\nseparate bandwidths to improve the sensitivity of our observations.\nThe observing procedure involved looking at the galaxy for 6 minutes and then doing an offsource scan over the same zenith angle and azimuth range for an additional 6 minutes. We repeated\nobserving these on-off pairs until we felt we had a firm detection, or that no detection was easily\nforthcoming. Time on source and measured noise levels for each target are presented in Tables 1\n& 2 respectively.\n\n2.3.\n\nH i Reductions\n\nCalibration of the data was done using the Arecibo package, ANALYZ. We started by combinf\ning each pair of on-off scans by taking on\u2212of\nof f . Each combined pair was then corrected for gain and\nTsys variations with zenith angle and converted from TB in Kelvins to flux in Janskys using the\ntabulated gain factors from the Arecibo Users' Manual. This factor is roughly 3.6 Jy K\u22121 , but varies\nwith the zenith angle of the observation. All scans for a given galaxy were then averaged together.\nWe then averaged the two polarizations for each galaxy together to get a combined un-polarized\nspectrum. Finally, we did a first or second order baseline subtraction on the unpolarized, combined\nspectrum to get our final, calibrated, reduced spectrum of flux versus heliocentric velocity. As a\ncheck on our reductions, we compared the total H i flux with previously published values for UCM\n2325+2318, otherwise known as NGC 7673. We find that the H i flux agrees to within 5% of the\nvalue found by Nordgren et al. (1997a) with the VLA. The data was then ported into IDL for the\nanalysis. Figure 2 shows the calibrated H i spectra for all observed galaxies as the light grey lines.\n3\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory is part of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center which is operated by Cornell\nUniversity under a Cooperative Agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n2.4.\n\nKeck Echelle Spectroscopy & Reductions\n\nAt the Keck I 10 m telescope4 we used the HIRES spectrograph (Vogt et al. 1994) with the blue\ncross disperser to obtain R \u223c30,000 spectra over the wavelength range 3600 - 5200 \u00c5. Observing\noccurred 1999 October 14-15 and 2000 September 14-15. The primary goal was to use the H\u03b2 \u03bb4861\nemission line to measure the kinematics of the ionized gas. For two galaxies, UCM 2351+2321 and\nUCM 2325+2318, the redshifted H\u03b2 line fell at the edge of the detector, so we instead use the [O III]\n\u03bb4959 line in the following analysis. The slit decker D1 measuring 1.15\u2032\u2032 in the spectral direction\nand 14.0\u2032\u2032 in the spatial direction was used for all objects except UCM0135+2242, UCM0148+2123,\nand UCM0159+2354 where the C5 slit decker measuring 1.15\u2032\u2032 \u00d77.0\u2032\u2032 was used. Periodic exposures\nof a Th-Ar arc lamp were used to establish the radial velocity and dispersion. The wavelength\nzeropoint of each exposure is good to an RMS of 0.003 \u00c5. The mean instrumental resolution was\n0.12 \u00c5 FWHM (7.4 km s\u22121 ) at 4900 \u00c5 based on exposures of arc lamps. One 1200 s exposure was\nobtained for each object. During each exposure, the telescope was moved in order to drift the slit\nslowly across each target to simulate a \"spatially integrated\" spectrum that would be obtained if\nall objects were unresolved at large distances. Inspection of the resulting spectra showed that the\n14\u2032\u2032 slit was long enough to cover the entire emission line region of each galaxy, except in the case of\nUCM2325+2318 where portions of the low-surface brightness disk extended beyond the ends of the\nslit. In the reduction process, each spectrum was summed along the spatial dimension to produce\na 1D emission line spectrum. The resulting optical emission line spectrum for each galaxy is shown\noverplotted in black on the H i spectrum in Figure 2. There is good correspondence between the\nH i and H ii systemic velocities, confirming that we have correctly identified objects placed at the\ncenter of the Arecibo beam. W20 has been calculated from the H ii line for each galaxy observed\nand the results appear in Table 2. A comparison of our spatially integrated spectra with the single\nposition spectra of Gallego et al. (2001, in preparation) show that our values are larger, on average,\nby 7% with an RMS deviation of 19%. Therefore the linewidths of our galaxies are statistically the\nsame regardless of whether they are measured at a single position or are spatially-integrated.\n\n2.5.\n\nWIYN Imaging\n\nWe obtained R-band images of all 11 galaxies with the WIYN5 3.5 m telescope using the MiniMosaic 4k\u00d74k CCD camera during 2000 October 16-17 and November 17-18 in 1.2\u2032\u2032 (mean) seeing.\nThe pixel scale was 0.141 arcsec/pixel, and integration times were 1-2 \u00d7300 s. The images were\n4\n\nSome of the data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific\npartnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck\nFoundation.\n5\n\nThe WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale\nUniversity, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nreduced in the standard manner. We use these images below to characterize the morphology of each\ngalaxy and supplement the data available in the literature (e.g., Vitores et al. 1997; Gallego et al.\n1996). Rotational asymmetries, A, were computed following the procedures and method specified in\nConselice et al. (2000); half-light radii, Ref f , and concentration indices, C, were computed following\nthe procedures specified by Bershady et al. (2000). These values are therefore on the same system\nas computed for the Frei (1999) local galaxy sample by these authors.\nBecause the half-light radii were in the range of 1.5 to 9 arcsec, there were cases when we\nneeded to apply corrections to the asymmetry values, half-light sizes, and concentration indices to\naccount for the seeing. The corrections are in the sense of increasing the asymmetry and image\nconcentration, while decreasing the half-light radius. The corrections for asymmetry are based on\nthe simulations presented in Figure 19 of Conselice et al. (2000), and generally resulted in changes\n< 15%. However, we note that the simulations included only one source plausibly similar to these\nsources: NGC 4449. To correct the half-light sizes and concentration indices, we modeled the effects\nof seeing based on a simulated grid of aberrated, two-dimensional analytic light distributions (r1/4 law and exponential profiles with a range of axial ratios). The corrections to the half-light radii were\ngenerally under 15% and the changes in the concentration indices were typically a few tenths in the\nindex. A comparison of our half-light radii and concentration indices with previous determinations\nshow agreement of the means to 1% and 28% with an RMS deviation of 21% and 12%, respectively,\nto Vitores et al. (1996) and 6% and 1% for the mean with RMS deviation of 21% 17% to Pe\u0155ezGonz\u00e1lez et al. (2000), with few outliers. Our adopted WIYN values for Ref f , C, and A are listed\nin Table 3. For all subsequent discussions we will use these values, as determined from the WIYN\nimages.\n\n3.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFor each galaxy we measured the total H i flux, the 20% velocity width, and the central velocity\nof each galaxy as listed in Table 2. The total H i flux was determined by integrating under the\nspectrum from where the galaxy first appears from the noise, to where it becomes indistinguishable\nfrom the noise. The RMS was measured from the off-line region and used to determine the error\non the integrated flux. For UCM 2351+2321, which was not detected, the 3\u03c3 upper limit to the\nflux is set for an assumed H i velocity width equal to the optical width as noted in Table 2. The\noptical velocity widths come from our Keck observations. As most of the galaxy spectra rise very\nslowly out of the noise, we Hanning smoothed the spectra to assist in determining the 20% velocity\nwidth. Typically, we Hanning smoothed over 3 or 5 channels, then we used a program to identify\nall crossings of the 20% of peak intensity. We selected the most probable velocity width from\nthese options. The cited velocity center is simply the midpoint between the 20% crossings. The\nerrors on these values represent the approximate range of widths (and central velocities) due to\nthe uncertainty determining the 20% crossing points. For UCM 2351+2321 the optical recession\nvelocity is cited, and used to calculate a distance, due to the lack of a detection in H i. This\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ndistance is listed in Table 3 and is used to calculate distance-dependent quantities such as H i\nmass, luminosity, and linear size.\nWe have also attempted to derive the dynamical masses for these galaxies. To do this we need\na rotation velocity and a radius corresponding to that velocity. We used half of the inclinationcorrected W20 as a reasonable approximation for the rotation velocity. For the corresponding radius,\nRH i , we scaled the effective radius, Ref f , determined from our WIYN images, up by a factor of\n4.5. This factor is based on the ratio of the Ref f to R24.5 found for these galaxies in Vitores et al.\n(1996), which was 2.4. We rounded this up to 2.5 to get an estimate of R25 , and then multiplied R25\nby 1.8 to get RH i , based on the observed ratio of R25 to RH i found by Broeils (1992) for nearby\ngas-rich galaxies. RH i may even be higher as van Zee, Skillman, & Salzer (1998) find RH i /R25\nranging from 2.8-4.9 for a sample of 5 H ii galaxies. Using RH i and Vrot , we calculate an estimate\nfor the dynamical mass:\n\nMdyn =\n\n2 R\nVrot\nH i.\nG\n\n(1)\n\nTable 4 lists these dynamical masses along with the hydrogen gas mass fraction, fgas =MH i /Mdyn .\nTables 3 and 4 also list the optical properties of the sample galaxies, including absolute blue magnitudes, MB , B-r and B-V colors computed within the 24 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote, the effective surface\nbrightness within the 24 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote, the H\u03b1 luminosity, and the inclination of these\ngalaxies (from Vitores et al. 1996a, 1996b; Gallego et al. 1996, 1997; Pe\u0155ez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000).\nTo assist in examining the evolutionary potential of these galaxies we calculated the star\nformation rates for these galaxies from the listed redenning-corrected H\u03b1 luminosities (Gallego et\nal 1996) using the expression given in Kennicutt (1983):\nSF R(M\u2299 yr \u22121 ) =\n\nLH\u03b1\n1.12 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nUsing the star formation rate and the H i mass of each galaxy, we calculate the gas depletion\ntimescale, \u03c4gas = MHI /SF R listed in Table 4. These estimates do not account for recycling of the\ngas, for the presence of helium (\u223c 40% of the H i mass), or for molecular gas. All of these factors\nwould increase \u03c4gas 6 . It is important to note that the LH\u03b1 values from Gallego et al. (1996) were\nmeasured through the spectrograph slit. Therefore they only represent a fraction of the total LH\u03b1\nof the galaxy as would be measured via narrow-band imaging. Correcting for this underestimate\nwould decrease our estimates of \u03c4gas . It is unclear, however, how to determine the extent of this\ncorrection with our current data.\n6\n\nIf we use the updated expression from Kennicutt et al. (1994) the SFR will be lower by \u223c10% (\u03c4gas will be higher\nby the same amount). The expression from Alonso-Herrero et al. (1996) will decrease the SFR and increase \u03c4gas by\na factor of 2.8.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nImages of the target galaxies appear in Figure 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows Digital Sky Survey\n(DSS) images centered on the observed target coordinates. Each image is 3.\u2032 8 on a side, to match\nthe angular size of Arecibo beam and assist in determining the nature of the objects we observed.\nFigure 4 shows the WIYN R-band images of our sample galaxies using a logarithmic greyscale. In\norder to facilitate comparison between galaxies, we have scaled these images so that each dimension\ncovers a projected distance of 10 kpc at the adopted distances listed in Table 3.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nGalaxy Properties\nUCM 0014+1829\n\nOptically, UCM0014+1829 has an oblong central region with a more diffuse outer disk. There is\na bright star very close to the nucleus which complicates the determination of its optical properties.\nNo other galaxies are evident in the DSS image. UCM 0014+1829 has the second largest half-light\nradius, 1.7 kpc, in our sample, and is one of the more concentrated objects as well, C=4.08. It is\nrelatively symmetric, A=0.08. The H i profile is single peaked and slightly asymmetric. The H ii\nspectrum is symmetric, centered at the same velocity as the peak of the H i profile, but is narrower\nwith a width of 117 km s\u22121 vs 204 km s\u22121 . A low amplitude wing to low velocity is evident in\nboth spectra.\n\n4.2.\n\nUCM 0040+0220\n\nUCM 0040+0220 is the featureless point source in the middle of the DSS image. It has a small\nsize (Ref f =0.6 kpc), is symmetric (A=0.09), and is not very concentrated (C=3.0). This galaxy has\none of the smallest \u03c4gas values, 0.41 Gyr, of our sample due, in part, to its low MH i , 2.6\u00d7108 M\u2299 .\nWhile there is a strong double-horned H i profile at \u223c4500 km s\u22121 , UCM 0040+0220 is the weaker\nfeature at \u223c5400 km s\u22121 . The other features at higher recession velocities may be real, but we do\nnot have the signal-to-noise ratio in this observation to confirm them. The H i profile is somewhat\nasymmetric, but is hard to characterize due to its low signal-to-noise ratio. The H ii spectrum has\na tail to lower velocity, similar to that in the H i profile. The double-horned H i profile at \u223c4500\nkm s\u22121 is most likely the diffuse galaxy east of UCM 0040+0220 in the DSS image.\n\n4.3.\n\nUCM 0056+0043\n\nOur WIYN image of UCM 0056+0043 reveals that it is slightly extended in the east-west\ndirection. No other galaxies are evident in the DSS image of the field. This galaxy has a halflight radius of 0.9 kpc, an average concentration of 2.96, and a low asymmetry of 0.07. The H i\nspectrum of UCM 0056+0043 is a strong single peak with weak high velocity wings extending to\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nlower redshift. The profile is slightly asymmetric. The H ii spectrum matches the H i profile very\nclosely, with an absence of high-velocity wings. The H ii width (126 km s\u22121 ) is nearly identical\nto the H i width (133 km s\u22121 ). This galaxy has the smallest width of all our sample galaxies, the\nsmallest dynamical mass (5\u00d7109 M\u2299 ), and the highest gas mass fraction at 0.58. It also has one of\nthe longest gas depletion timescales, 6.3 Gyr.\n\n4.4.\n\nUCM 0135+2242\n\nThis galaxy has a rather extended, diffuse disk evident in its WIYN image with a large\nRef f =1.4 kpc. The concentration is high at 4.0, and the galaxy is very symmetric, A=0.02. UCM\n0135+2242 is one of the most massive galaxies in our sample, Mdyn =4.4\u00d71010 M\u2299 , and has a long\n\u03c4gas of 2.5 Gyr, despite its high SFR of 1.7 M\u2299 yr \u22121 . A potential small companion is evident just\nto the southwest in the image as well. The DSS image reveals another diffuse galaxy at the southern most extent of the Arecibo field, which may or may not be associated. UCM 0135+2242 has\na double-horned H i profile which is slightly asymmetric. The H ii profile is narrower (W20 =225\nkm s\u22121 ) and more symmetric than the H i profile (W20 =249 km s\u22121 ). Intriguingly, the low redshift\npeak of the H i profile is broader and stronger than the H ii peak. In other words, the peak of the\nH i distribution does not contain corresponding H ii emission. This asymmetry in the H i profile,\nand discrepancy with the H ii profile, may indicate that multiple galaxies were observed in the\nArecibo beam, and/or that an interaction has occurred.\n\n4.5.\n\nUCM 0148+2123\n\nUCM 0148+2123 either has a double nucleus, or is two related objects which are possibly\nmerging based on our WIYN image of the galaxy. No other galaxies are evident in the Arecibo beam.\nThe morphological parameters suggest that this galaxy is not particularly large, Ref f =1.0 kpc, nor\nconcentrated, C=2.72, but it is quite asymmetric, A=0.13. The latter point is not surprising given\nthe double-lobed appearance of this galaxy. In addition, this galaxy has one of the smallest \u03c4gas ,\n0.65 Gyr, meaning it will rapidly use up its 3.8\u00d7108 M\u2299 of H i. This could be indicative of an\nongoing interaction. UCM 0148+2123 has a asymmetric single-peaked H i profile, which may be\ncaused by two galaxies being observed. As with most of our galaxies, the H ii profile is narrower\n(W20 =98 km s\u22121 ) and more symmetric than the H i profile (W20 =200 km s\u22121 ). The H i profile\nextends further to lower velocities than the H ii profile does, suggesting a difference in the neutral\nand ionized gas distributions\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n4.6.\n\nUCM 0159+2354\n\nUCM 0159+2354 features an elongated core and extended, diffuse disk indicative of a highly\ninclined system. There may be some small, faint galaxies also in this field, but it is not at all clear if\nthey are associated with our target galaxy. While UCM 0159+2354 has a normal Ref f , 1.0 kpc, it is\nthe most concentrated galaxy in our sample, 4.25, and is also optically asymmetric, A=0.12. Also,\nUCM 0159+2354 is the reddest galaxy in our sample with a B-r color of 1.00. The H i spectrum\nshows a single-peaked profile for this galaxy. The center of the H ii spectrum is offset in velocity\nfrom the H i profile (4925 km s\u22121 vs. 4901 km s\u22121 ). The H ii profile is also narrower (138 km s\u22121\nvs. 192 km s\u22121 ). This may indicate a real difference in the distributions of the neutral and ionized\ngas.\n\n4.7.\n\nUCM 2251+2352\n\nThere are two galaxies apparent in the H i spectrum of UCM 2251+2352. While both detections have similar widths, the one at higher redshift is significantly brighter and is our desired\ntarget, based on its coincidence with the H ii profile. The H i profile is wider than the H ii profile\n(140 km s\u22121 vs. 79 km s\u22121 ), mostly due to high-velocity wings, while the central profiles match\nquite well. The Digitized Sky Survey image shows a few faint galaxies to the south and west of\nour target galaxy, but it is not clear if this is what we have detected at lower redshift in our H i\nspectrum. Our WIYN R-band image reveals a very faint, nearly face-on, barred spiral structure.\nThe face-on nature of this galaxy makes any dynamical mass determination highly uncertain, due\nto the large inclination corrections needed. UCM 2251+2352 has a somewhat extended disk, with\nRef f =1.4 kpc, and is relatively concentrated, C=3.43. It is, however, the most asymmetric galaxy\nin our sample, with A=0.27.\n\n4.8.\n\nUCM 2304+1640\n\nUCM 2304+1640 has a bright core, with a faint, extended, diffuse disk surrounding it. The\nDSS image of the field shows multiple diffuse objects, suggesting that we may have a spectrum\nof a galaxy group. The half-light radius of UCM 2304+1640 is one of the smallest in our sample\nat 0.7 kpc. The galaxy is rather concentrated, C=3.35, and asymmetric, A=0.12, as well. This\ngalaxy has a single-peaked H i profile which is somewhat rounded on top; this would be consistent\nwith observing a group of galaxies as seen in the DSS image. The H ii profile is more symmetric,\nnarrower, and slightly offset from the peak of the H i profile, also consistent with multiple objects\nbeing in the Arecibo beam.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.9.\n\nUCM 2325+2318\n\nBoth the WIYN and DSS images of UCM 2325+2318, also known as NGC 7673, clearly shows\nsignatures of interactions, with loops and a tail apparent around the main galaxy. This is the\nmost extended galaxy in our sample, Ref f =1.9 kpc, and not very concentrated, C=2.98. UCM\n2325+2318 is also the most asymmetric galaxy we observed, with A=0.60. Conselice, Bershady\n& Gallagher (2000) measured the same A value based on earlier WIYN imaging, and noted this\ngalaxy has a large ratio of W20 to W50 . These authors found that a large value of this ratio\nwas correlated with morphology, indicative of recent interactions. Consistent with this, Gallego et\nal. (1996) have identified three components in their H ii spectrum of this galaxy and stated that\nthis is an interacting system. Nordgren et al. (1997a) observed the H i disk of this system to be\ndisturbed. NGC 7673 is also a well-known luminous FIR source (Sanders & Mirabel 1996); not\nsurprising considering that the SFR is 23.5 M\u2299 yr \u22121 , yielding \u03c4gas =0.18 Gyr. This is the highest\nSFR and shortest \u03c4gas in our sample. UCM 2325+2318 has a very strong, single-peaked H i profile.\nwhich has been studied in detail by Homeier & Gallagher (1999) with spectra from the WIYN\nDensePak integral field unit. In particular, they have measured the velocity field of this galaxy\nin the plane of the sky yielding a better estimate of its rotation velocity, W20 =126 km s\u22121 vs.\nW20 =119 km s\u22121 from our Keck spectrum; a fine agreement. The H ii profile is narrower than the\nH i profile (W20 =119 km s\u22121 vs. 164 km s\u22121 ), and the relative positions of the peaks differ by\n\u223c 10 km s\u22121 .\n\n4.10.\n\nUCM 2329+2512\n\nThe WIYN image of UCM 2329+2512 reveals a very small (Ref f =0.6 kpc), concentrated\n(C=4.15) galaxy with a faint, stellar loop, possibly indicative of a recent interaction. Despite this\nsignature of interaction, it is remarkably symmetric, A=0.02. The low asymmetry is because the\nmeasurement of asymmetric is only in the central 7\u2032\u2032 , and is dominated by the bright central region,\nand not the faint loops. The faint loops could just be the projection of a strong two-armed spiral\npattern in a highly inclined disk, and not a tidal tail. The symmetric, double-horned H i profile\nwould support the idea that this system has not been disturbed. UCM 2329+2512 also has a low\nSFR, and the longest \u03c4gas , 7.3 Gyr, of our sample. No other galaxies are apparent in the DSS image\nof the Arecibo field. The H ii spectrum of this galaxy is completely different from the H i profile,\nwith a symmetric single-peaked profile. This suggests that the limited star formation in this galaxy\nis taking place only in the central regions, while the H i is much more extended.\n\n4.11.\n\nUCM 2351+2321\n\nWe did not detect H i in UCM 2351+2321. The 3\u03c3 upper limit on its H i mass is 1.3\u00d7108 M\u2299\nfor an assumed width 160 km s\u22121 (from the H ii spectrum). There is a hint of H i emission near\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nwhere the H ii profile rises at high velocity, but it is too weak to be a definite detection. Optically,\nUCM 2351+2321 is one of the reddest (B-r = 0.94 mag) and most concentrated, C=4.02, targets.\nIn some respects, this is the most interesting galaxy of the entire sample because of the strong H\u03b1\nemission, yet weak H i emission, implying a very small gas depletion timescale of <0.03 Gyr. If any\ngalaxy among our sample represents a transition type between a gas-rich starburst and a gas-poor\nspheroidal, this may be such an object.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nKinematics of Local Blue Compact Galaxies\n\nThe most interesting feature of our sample is that the ratio of H ii to H i 21-cm linewidths,\nR=W20 (H ii)/W20 (H i), is always below unity. A further examination of the observed H ii and H i\nprofiles in Figure 2 shows that all but one of the H ii spectra (UCM 0135+2242) and all but two\nof the H i spectra (UCM 0135+2242 and UCM 2329+2512) are single peaked, indicative of either\nextremely face-on disks or solid body rotation curves commonly seen in H ii galaxies (e.g., van Zee\net al. 1998). The latter option is more likely due to the large velocity widths of the lines, despite\nbeing singly-peaked.\nFigure 5 plots R versus the H ii emission linewidths, W20 (H ii). Filled circles denote galaxies\nfrom this paper, while crosses denote the spiral and irregular galaxies studied by Kobulnicky &\nGebhardt (2000), triangles denote the spiral sample of Raychaudhury et al. (1997), and squares\nare the H ii galaxies from Telles & Terlevich (1993). It is evident from the figure that the H ii\u2013H i\nlinewidth ratio systematically departs from unity for small H ii linewidths. This effect is most\nprevalent for galaxies with W20 (H ii)\u2264 200 km s\u22121 . The compact galaxies from our paper show a\nsystematic difference between the neutral and ionized gas kinematics, such that they have a mean\nR=0.66\u00b10.16, which is different from most normal galaxies with a ratio closer to one. Our galaxies\nare similar, in this respect, to the H ii galaxies and H ii regions studied by Telles & Terlevich (1993)\nwhich have linewidth ratios \u03c3[O III] /\u03c3H i \u223c0.7. Figure 5 illustrates that this discrepancy between\nthe H ii and H i linewidths seems to vary smoothly from large linewidths to small. Therefore, we\nhave attempted to quantify this effect for all galaxies through an approximate polynomial fit to the\ndata as follows:\n\nR=\n\nWH ii\n\u22121\n\u22122\n5\n\u22123\n= 1 \u2212 5 WH\nii \u2212 500 WH ii \u2212 2.5 \u00d7 10 WH ii\nWH i\n\n(3)\n\nThis equation yields a very rapid drop-off in R below W20 (H ii) = 100 km s\u22121 , which becomes\nunphysical below W20 (H ii) = 68 km s\u22121 . Since we have not observed R values below 0.4, we\nsuggest that when applying the above formula, a lower bound of 0.3 is imposed.\nNote that there is still a large scatter around this fit, so this formula should be applied with\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ngreat caution. A likely interpretation of the data is that the optical emission lines trace a smaller\nportion of the gravitational potential than the H i does, particularly in those galaxies with the\nsmallest linewidth galaxies (i.e., \u03c3 <40 km s\u22121 ). For these galaxies, the dynamical masses based\non the width of optical emission lines will underestimate their masses by factors of 2-4. However,\nfor galaxies with velocity widths \u03c3 larger than \u223c40 km s\u22121 the effect on the mass estimates is only\n<20%.\nIn addition to the observed dependence on velocity width, we have attempted to find a set\nof observational parameters which can identify galaxies in which the linewidth ratio, R, is small.\nWhile we searched for correlations between all the observed parameters (color, SFR, concentration,\nasymmetry, Ref f , SBe , etc.) and the linewidth ratio, we had limited success. In Figure 6 we plot\nthe relation between the linewidth ratio, H\u03b1 equivalent width, and concentration index; NGC 4449\nis plotted as a comparison object. Only the lower panel shows any hint of a correlation: objects\nwith higher EW(H\u03b1) seem to have lower linewidth ratios, while those lower EW(H\u03b1) have a wider\nrange of ratios. The relation, really an upper envelope, between EW(H\u03b1) and R may indicate that\ngalaxies undergoing a large starburst have small linewidth ratios. Physically, this could be caused\nby a minor merger driving some gas into the center of a galaxy, triggering a central starburst (e.g.\nHernquist & Mihos 1995). Therefore, most of the line emission will be centrally concentrated,\nwhile the H i disk will be more extended. Such a starburst cannot dominate the optical light,\nhowever, since there is no correlation between the linewidth ratio or EW(H\u03b1) and concentration\nindex. Alternatively, some of the H i gas could be in the process of being ejected from the galaxy\nand is no longer tracing the gravitational potential. This would require very large amounts of mass\nto be ejected without being ionized. Furthermore, the shapes of most of the H i profiles can be\nmore simply explained by galactic rotation than by ejection.\n\n5.2.\n\nNeutral Gas Masses and the Potential For Future Star Formation\n\nThe 10 galaxies with 21 cm detections have H i masses ranging from 0.26-4.3\u00d7109 M\u2299 . This\nH i mass range is typical for later-type spiral (Sc-Sm) and irregular galaxies (Roberts & Haynes\n1994). The SFRs of our 10 sample galaxies range between 0.23-23.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Thus, our samples\nspans a wide range of H i masses and H\u03b1 luminosities (or SFR) similar to the heterogeneous sample\nof spiral galaxies studied by Kennicutt, Tamblyn, & Congdon (1994; KTC) as shown in Figure 7.\nThe gas depletion timescales for our sample galaxies are also similar to the KTC sample, with\ntypical \u03c4gas > 1 Gyr, also shown in Figure 7. Only 3-4 galaxies in our sample have \u03c4gas less than 1\nGyr: UCM 0040+0220, UCM 0148+2123, UCM 2325+2318, and UCM 2351+2321. These are not\nanomalously low for KTC spirals, but are on the lower edge of the distribution. The cause of these\nlow \u03c4gas values is either having a small H i mass and a moderate SFR (e.g. UCM 0040+0220 and\nUCM 0148+2123), or a high SFR and moderate MH i (e.g. UCM 2325+2318), or a combination\nof high SFR and low MH i (e.g. UCM 2351+2321).\nFrom the inclination-corrected H i linewidths, we estimate the dynamical mass of each system\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nusing RH i as a fiducial radius. The masses range from 3.7 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 to 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . It\nshould be noted that the derived inclinations can be highly uncertain (\u00b115\u25e6 ), and produce large\ncorrections to the H i linewidths for low inclinations. Such errors in inclination propagate into our\nmass determination as the square of the linewidth. If our estimate of RH i = 4.5 Ref f is too large,\nthen the dynamical masses should be reduced in proportion to RH i .\nUsing our derived Mdyn and calculated MH i we can calculate the neutral hydrogen gas mass\nfraction, fgas . The gas mass fractions for our sample have reasonable values that range from 0.01 to\n0.54 with a mean value of 0.12. Thus, some of these galaxies may be gas rich like nearby H ii and\nirregular galaxies (fgas \u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.5; Van Zee, Salzer & Skillman 1998) while others could have gas\nmass fractions typical of the Milky Way and other spirals (fgas < 0.10; Roberts & Haynes 1994).\nThere are some ambiguities in the interpretation of H i profiles worth consideration. Our\nestimates of H i masses may be too large if there are multiple galaxies in the relatively large\nArecibo beam (90 kpc in extent at an average distance of 83 Mpc). Multiple galaxies are not\nnecessarily easy to identify from a spatially integrated H i profile. They can produce asymmetric\nsingle or doubly peaked profiles, and/or flat or rounded-top H i profiles (see Nordgren et al. 1997a,\n1997b for examples). Depending on the masses and dynamics of the system, the asymmetries may\nbe quite small, even if the relative masses are high. An overestimate of the H i masses would\nresult in an overestimate of \u03c4gas . Therefore, these galaxies may be using up their H i at a more\nprodigious rate than indicated by the present estimates. Finally, it is difficult to determine if\ninteractions are ongoing in the sample galaxies from the H i profiles. Interactions will affect the\nobserved linewidths, and, hence, the accuracy of our calculated dynamical masses. Strong single\npeaks are predicted and seen in some merger remnants (Horellou & Booth 1997; Bendo & Barnes\n2000), but other interacting systems or merger remnants are indistinguishable from normal, isolated\ngalaxies (Horellou & Booth 1997). Only with higher spatial resolution H i observations can these\nambiguities be cleared up. For this paper we can only assume that we have observed single galaxies.\n\n5.3.\n\nComparison to Intermediate Redshift Blue Compact Galaxies\n\nOver the last few years, there has been an increasing controversy surrounding the reliability\nof the virial mass estimates using velocity widths measured from ionized gas emission in BCGs at\nintermediate redshifts. It is well known that the ionized gas does not always sample the whole range\nof the rotation curve, since the space distribution of the ionized gas is typically more compact than\nthe extended HI (e.g., Broeils 1992; Taylor et al. 1995). Velocity widths derived using ionized gas\nemission lines likely underestimate the actual galaxy gravitational potential, and thus the inferred\nvirial mass. The key question is: \"How do we relate optical line-widths to the rotation velocity?\"\nSince emission line velocity widths are often used to estimate galaxy masses in unresolved BCGs at\nhigher redshifts, it is important to assess the degree at which these measurements may be biased\nby a likely underestimation of the actual rotation velocity.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nFor BCGs at redshift z < 0.35, the issue was first discussed by Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1996) who reanalyzed R in the published data for a sample of nearby HII galaxies (Telles & Terlevich 1992) and\nconcluded that \"since CNELGs are similar to H II galaxies, the measured velocity widths are likely\nto underestimate their internal velocities by as much as 30%\". A 30% increase was thus applied to\nvelocity widths measurements in subsequent papers (e.g., Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1998). The value of this\ncorrection was also investigated by Rix et al. (1997) who compared the velocity dispersion in the\nionized gas, \u03c3v , with the maximum circular velocity of the ionized gas, Vc , for three, well-resolved,\nnearby galaxies. They found an average value of \u03c3v /Vc = 0.6 which is consistent with the analytic\nprescription of Tully & Fouqu\u00e9 (1985). On the other hand, Lehnert & Heckman (1996) showed a\nvery poor correlation between emission line velocity widths and rotational velocities for a sample\nof local starburst galaxies (see their figure 13). They noted that emission lines from nuclear regions\ntrace only a fraction of the rising portion of the rotation curve in nuclear starbursts, but they did\nnot investigate how this affected the spatially-integrated optical spectrum of the galaxy, or how\nglobal optical linewidths compared to the H i linewidths. Neither Rix et al. (1997) nor Lehnert &\nHeckman (1996) discussed the relation of the ionized gas kinematics to the neutral gas kinematics,\nwhich is the issue of interest here. Kobulnicky & Gebhardt (2000) performed integrated optical\nspectroscopy of 21 galaxies, including some of the Lehnert & Heckman (1996) nuclear starburst\nsample, and they found good agreement between optical and H i linewidths for all objects except\nNGC 4449. Note that NGC 4449 is the object in the Kobulnicky & Gebhardt (2000) sample that\nmost closely resembles the BCG population.\nIn order to assess the relevance of our work for distant galaxies, it is important to consider\nhow analogous our sample of 11 galaxies is to the intermediate redshift BCGs that we wish to learn\nmore about. We can examine how our sample galaxies compare in the MB \u2013\u03c3H ii and Ref f \u2013\u03c3H ii\nplanes. In Figure 8 we compare the distribution of our sample galaxies to the BCGs of Phillips\net al. (1997) and Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1998). While our galaxies span nearly the full range of MB and\nRef f as the distant BCGs, they have systematically smaller linewidths. Indeed, the nearby sample\nshows a mean emission line velocity width near 30 km s\u22121 compared to 50-60 km s\u22121 for the BCGs;\nboth sets of linewidths are uncorrected for inclination. Figure 8 brings into question whether we are\ntruly observing analogs to the intermediate redshift BCGs. We believe, however, that our sample\ngalaxies, while not representative of all intermediate redshift BCGs, are similar to those with the\nsmallest linewidths (i.e., \u03c3 < 40 km s\u22121 ).\nThe hypothesis that we are observing analogs to at least some of the intermediate redshift\nBCGs is supported by examining other morphological and photometric properties of our galaxies.\nIn Figure 9, we plot the B \u2212 V colors versus asymmetry, A, concentration index, C, and Bband surface brightness with the half-light radius, SBe, for our sample galaxies, the Frei (1999)\nsample of local, luminous elliptical and spiral galaxies with parameters measured by Bershady\net al. (2000), the luminous BCG sample from Jangren et al. (2001), and the BCG sample from the\nHDF-ff with parameters measured by Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1997). With the exception of two red sources\n(UCM0159+2354 and UCM2351+2321), our galaxies occupy a location in the B \u2212 V vs. SBe and\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nB \u2212 V vs. C planes that overlaps strongly with the intermediate redshift BCG samples and is\nclearly distinct from normal, nearby galaxies. Most of the galaxies in our sample are less luminous\nand redder than the majority of the intermediate redshift BCGs. Based on the definition of BCGs\nfrom Jangren et al. (2001) 7 of our 11 galaxies are \"BCGs\" (the exceptions are UCM 0148+2124,\nUCM 0159+2354, UCM 2329+2512, and UCM 2351+2321). Of those seven, only the three most\nluminous galaxies in our sample technically fit the \"LBCG\" definition of Jangren et al. (2001)\n(UCM 2325+2318, UCM 0135+2242, and UCM 2251+2352). All of these points serve to illustrate\nthat we must be very careful about what we infer regarding the nature of intermediate redshift\nBCGs based on observations of our sample of galaxies or similar samples in the local universe. For\ninstance, the two nearby galaxies Barton & van Zee (2001) propose are local counterparts to the\nintermediate redshift BCG population would not have been selected as such by the color - surface\nbrightness criteria defined by Jangren et al. (2001). These two nearby galaxies are either redder\nor of lower surface brightness (or both) than the intermediate redshift BCGs as well as the nearby\nsample studied here. With this caveat in mind, we will now examine what we can learn about\nintermediate redshift BCGs.\nAt the top of Figure 5, we have drawn several boxes to represent the range of linewidths for\nthe galaxies in the studies of the Hubble Deep Field flanking fields (Phillips et al. 1997), z\u223c0.6\nfield galaxies (Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. 1999), z\u223c0.25 field galaxies (Rix et al. 1997) and compact blue\ngalaxies at z\u223c0.4 (Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1998). Figure 5 shows that the discrepancy between H ii and\nH i linewidths described in Section 4.1 could affect the mass determinations in all these studies.\nThe effect can be as much as a factor of 2-4 for the smallest velocity width galaxies. However,\naccording to our empirical relation, the effect may be only \u223c30-40% for galaxies with velocity\nwidths \u03c3 > 40 km s\u22121 . Note that this effect is in addition to other well-recognized uncertainties in\nmass determinations due to unknown inclinations and clumpy gas distributions (modeled for spiral\ngalaxies by Rix et al. 1997). A more rigorous approach to apply the results from our study to the\nintermediate redshift BCG population is to restrict our conclusions only to the seven galaxies that\ncan be considered \"bona fide\" counterparts according to Jangren et al.'s definition. These galaxies\nhave a R ranging from 0.54 to 0.94, with a mean value of 0.70. The three \"bona fide\" LBCG\ncounterparts have essentially the same mean and range. For the 3 non-BCG galaxies we detected\nin H i the mean value of R is only 0.54. These values of R for BCGs are in good agreement with\nthe corrections applied to the mass estimates in previous work at higher redshift (e.g., Guzm\u00e1n\net al. 1996, 1998).\nOne of the most interesting conclusions derived using mass estimates of BCGs at intermediate\nredshifts is that their mass-to-light ratios are roughly one order of magnitude lower than those values\ncharacteristic of local galaxies with similar luminosities (Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1996; Phillips et al. 1997).\nThis conclusion can be tested with our sample of nearby BCGs. For consistency with previous work,\nwe define the mass-to-light ratio within Ref f (instead of RHI ), using the velocity dispersion of the\nH i and uncorrected by inclination effects. This definition allows a direct comparison with values\npublished in the literature for a wide variety of galaxy types. For our entire sample, the derived\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nmass-to-light ratios range from 0.07 to 0.78 M\u2299 /LB\n\u2299 . The mean mass-to-light ratio for non-BCGs,\nB\n0.6 M\u2299 /L\u2299 , is higher than for the BCGs, 0.3 M\u2299 /LB\n\u2299 , in our sample. These values are consistent\nwith the mass-to-light ratios for intermediate redshift BCGs studied by Phillips et al. (1997). The\nmean absolute magnitude is MB = \u221219.2 mag; about 1.3 magnitudes fainter than L\u22c6. Using the\nsame representative sample of local galaxies in the RC3 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) analyzed\nby Phillips et al. (1997), we estimate that nearby, \"normal\" galaxies with MB \u223c \u221219.2 have\nmass-to-light ratios that approximately range from 0.8 to 10 M\u2299 /LB\n\u2299 . The observed range in massto-light ratio for BCGs inconsistent with that characteristic of massive systems with comparable\nluminosities, such as Sa-Sc spiral galaxies. These spirals tend to be the most abundant galaxy type\nwith this luminosity in the local universe. Instead, BCGs have mass-to-light ratios that are similar\nto the lowest observed values in lower-mass galaxies of similar luminosity, such as irregulars and\nHII galaxies. As our BCG counterparts evolve, their mass-to-light ratios will increase to values\nmore comparable to normal, spiral galaxies, provided that they fade.\nFinally, the observed distribution of gas depletion timescales \u03c4gas provides additional information about the nature and evolution of the distant BCG galaxy population. Of the seven BCGs\nin our sample, two have \u03c4gas < 0.5 Gyrs, two have \u03c4gas \u223c 1 Gyrs, and three have \u03c4gas > 2 Gyrs.\nThe wide range observed suggests a very heterogeneous population of objects with very different\nburst strengths and reservoirs of neutral gas. The BCGs with the smallest gas depletion timescales\nwill shortly cease star formation and thus may be good candidates to undergo subsequent passive\nevolution. However, a long period of passive evolution following the end of the current starburst\nin BCGs with \u03c4gas > 2 Gyr seems less likely and these galaxies may continue having subsequent\nevents of star formation.\n\n5.4.\n\nImplications for the Evolution of the Tully-Fisher Relation\n\nA related controversy exists concerning whether velocity widths of ionized gas are suitable for\nthe study of galaxy scaling relations such as the Tully & Fisher relation (1977; T-F). Traditionally,\nthe T-F relation is a correlation measured between luminosity and HI line-width. It has been well\nestablished that \"terminal\" rotation speeds derived from spatially resolved velocity fields (in the\noptical or HI) provide a well-defined surrogate for HI line-widths for normal spiral galaxies in the\nlocal universe (e.g., Mathewson et al.1992, Courteau 1997). Ionized gas line-widths are of particular\ninterest for intermediate- and high-redshift work where spatial resolution and signal-to-noise are\nlimited and HI is out of reach with present telescopes and instrumentation. However, there has been\nonly limited exploration of whether optical line-widths are suitable surrogates for use in measuring\nthe T-F relation (e.g., Rix et al. 1997; KG00). Despite this fact, there have been a number of\nstudies attempting to exploit the observability of optical line-widths for drawing inferences about\nthe evolution of M/L of intermediate-redshift galaxies, as discussed in the Introduction. Our\npurpose here is to demonstrate that these results should be viewed with caution.\nFigure 10 shows how our sample of compact galaxies compares to the T-F relation. Each\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ngalaxy in our sample is plotted three times. Dotted circles denote the measured H ii linewidths,\nW20 (H ii), circles denote the measured H i 21-cm linewidths, W20 (HI), and filled circles denote\nthe inclination-corrected H i 21-cm linewidths, W20 (HI)/sin(i). For comparison, we also plot H ii\ngalaxies from Telles & Terlevich (1993; crosses), and the B-band Tully-Fisher relation of Pierce\n& Tully (1988; solid line).7 While the compact galaxies in our sample lie near the relation for\nH ii galaxies and show a large offset from the canonical T-F relation when using observed H ii\nline-widths, if we we adopt the inclination-corrected H i widths our sample is consistent on average\nwith the T-F relation for normal galaxies.\nPrompted by this result, we have re-examined the results of T-F studies at intermediate redshift\nemploying line-widths. Specifically, we have re-computed magnitude offsets from T-F for the Forbes\net al. (1996), Rix et al. (1997), and Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. (1999) samples after applying the linewidth correction in Equation 3 (Figure 5). The line-widths of the Forbes et al. sample are such\nthat corrections based on our formulation are minimal, despite the discussion noted above based on\ntheir own rotation curve data. Indeed, it is sobering to note that of the two galaxies for which they\nhave rotation curves, the galaxy with the small line-width correction appears to have a bimodal\nlight distribution, while the galaxy with the large line-width correction appears to be a relatively\nnormal spiral with large luminosity and size (see their figure 1).\nFor Rix et al. we use their tabulated line-widths and adopt the Pierce & Tully (1988) T-F\nrelation, which has a slope of \u03b3 = \u22126.86. The adopted slope is within 1\u03c3 of the value derived\nby Rix et al. (1997) for their intermediate-redshift sample; ours is a conservative choice since\ntheir mean slope is much steeper (\u03b3 = \u221214.3) and hence results in much larger magnitude-offset\ncorrections. We find a mean offset of -1.8 mag without applying line-width correction. This is -0.3\nmag larger than their quoted mean value, consistent with our ignoring the color-dependence to\nthe T-F zeropoint (see their \u00a73.3.1, eqn. 9). However, with line-width corrections we find a mean\noffset of -1.1 mag, or +0.7 mag less brightening than estimated by Rix et al. (1997). Accounting\nfor their color-dependence results in a net, corrected brightening of -0.8 mag in the T-F zeropoint\nat z \u223c 0.25.\nTo make a fair re-assessment with Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al.'s results, we adopt their T-F slope\nof \u03b3 = \u22127.46. Since Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. (1999) do not provide tabulated data nor a zeropoint\nfor their fiducial T-F relation, we estimate a correction for their median line-width (60 km s\u22121 )\n7\n\nMB = \u22126.86 log(VM ) \u2212 2.27. In order to convert VM to the observed quantity, W20 , we adopt the prescription of\nTully & Fouqu\u00e9 (1985),\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n(2 \u00d7 VM )2 = WR2 = W20\n+ Wt2 \u2212 2W20 Wt [1 \u2212 e\u2212(W20 /Wc ) ] \u2212 2Wt2 e\u2212(W20 /Wc ) .\n\n(4)\n\nWR is the rotation full amplitude which is 2\u00d7VM . Wt = 38 km s\u22121 is the width due to turbulent motions and\nWc = 120 km s\u22121 is the transition point between galaxies having Gaussian and those having double-horned H i\nprofiles.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nestimated from their figure 2, and calculate a differential correction, \u2206Mc , given as:\n\u2206Mc = \u2212\u03b3 log(\n\nWH ii\n),\nWH i\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the linewidth ratio is given by our Equation 3. We find a median correction is +0.2 mag,\nalthough we note that at the lower line-width limit of their sample the correction is +1.9 mag,\nwhich is comparable (but opposite in sign) to their average estimated brightening.\nIn isolation, the picture that emerges from this re-analysis of intermediate redshift line-width\nstudies is that the evolution of the T-F zeropoint is more gradual than previously suggested \u2013\neven for the bluest galaxies studied by Rix et al. (1997) and Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. (1999). For\nthese galaxies we estimate -0.8 mag at z \u223c 0.25 and -1.8 mag at z \u223c 0.6. However even this\nrevised estimate should still be tempered by the fact that corrections for color-dependence in the\nT-F relation relation and inclination are uncertain. For example, the color-dependence of the T-F\nzeropoint estimated by Rix et al. is \u223c3 times smaller than what is reported in Bershady et al. (2001).\nIn the absence of direct inclination measurements (e.g., b/a), Rix et al. (1997) have performed an\nelegant estimate of the mean inclination of their sample. They take into account that the bluest\ngalaxies may preferentially lie at relatively low inclinations (where internal reddening is minimized).\nHowever, our sample's mean inclination is 43\u25e6 , with a maximum of 60\u25e6 ; almost all of our sample\nis more face-on than the mean inclination of \u223c 57\u25e6 adopted by Rix et al. (1997). If our sample is\nrepresentative of the inclination distribution of the blue galaxy population, taking into account this\nchange in mean projection results in +0.6 mag less brightening (assuming \u03b3 = \u22126.86). Similarly,\nMall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. (1999) compare their uncorrected velocities for intermediate redshift galaxies\nto a local sample from the RC3. While they make identical cuts in b/a (< 0.8), the two samples\nmay not have comparable inclination distributions. Our arguments here are admittedly tentative,\nand are not intended to diminish the pioneering efforts to measure the T-F relation at intermediate\nredshifts. Yet the striking fact remains that most intermediate-redshift studies employing spatiallyresolved rotation curves find less evolution (e.g., Vogt et al.1996, 1997; Bershady et al. 1999), and\nthat by using the inclination-corrected H i linewidths even the galaxies studied in this paper fall\nsquarely on the local T-F relation.\nA corollary to the result in Figure 10 is that our local sample of BCGs cannot fade nor brighten\ndramatically and remain on the T-F relation. The relatively large reservoir of gas in most of these\nsystems indicates these galaxies will likely experience star-formation in their future, as discussed in\nprevious sections. However the amplitude of past and future star-formation is not well constrained,\nand so the basic assumption that these systems remain (or have been) on the T-F relation is weak.\nAnalogous galaxies at intermediate redshift also will be so weakly bound. Nonetheless, if we assume\nthese galaxies have remained on the T-F relation (or brighter) over lifetimes in excess of 5 Gyr,\nthen the current burst makes only a small contribution to the total stellar mass. Consequently, in\nthis scenario these galaxies also are not candidates for strong fading in the future.\nHowever, it is important to stress that the extant characteristics of the local galaxies studied\nhere are dissimilar to the extreme LBCGs for which a strong fading scenario was originally proposed\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nby Koo et al. (1995) and Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1996). The fading these authors postulated was part of\na transformation process whereby some subset of the LBCGs evolved into today's spheroidals. As\nsuch, these LBCGs would not be expected to lie or remain on the T-F relation at any time. In other\nwords, the assumption that these galaxies must remain on the T-F relation, made in the previous\nparagraph, is not valid in this scenario.\nFinally, the trends of our line-width ratio, R, with line-width also has implications for the linewidths of Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs) observed at z>2.7 (e.g., Pettini et al. 2001). Pettini et al.\nare skeptical of whether their ionized gas line-widths are tracing mass. They note, for instance, that\nthey find little evidence for a line-width luminosity relation in their sample or in a larger sample at\nz\u223c1. The effect of the line-width dependence of R will be to decrease the slope of the T-F relation,\nas shown in Figure 10. While the effect is rather mild in Figure 10, it may be more extreme for\ngalaxies at higher redshift. It is striking that while the LBGs are 1-3 magnitudes brighter than\nthe intermediate redshift LBCGS, they have comparable range of ionized-gas velocity widths, with\nmean values of 70 and 60 km s\u22121 respectively. Indeed, the gas content of galaxies is presumably\nlarger at higher redshifts, and hence it may be reasonable to expect that the value and trend of\nR with line-width evolves and becomes more extreme at higher redshift. We share, then, Pettini\net al.'s caution in interpreting their ionized gas line-widths, but remark that our corrections should\nat least provide a lower limit to what should be applied to the ionized gas line-widths at high\nredshift.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe present sample of compact galaxies were chosen to be analogous to the Blue Compact\nGalaxies (BCGs) at intermediate redshift, so that we could infer the gaseous properties of such\ngalaxies. For our sample, we find that the neutral hydrogen masses, hydrogen gas mass fractions,\nstar formation rates, and gas depletion timescales are comparable to nearby gas-rich spiral, irregular\nand HII galaxies. The broad range of HI properties imply BCGs form a very heterogeneous galaxy\nclass. Our sample galaxies have substantial amounts of neutral hydrogen (\u223c109 M\u2299 ) and large\ninferred total masses (\u223c1010 M\u2299 ). However, unlike most nearby, luminous spiral and irregular\ngalaxies, the ratio of H ii to H i linewidths, R is systematically less than unity with a mean value\nnear 0.66. In this respect our sample is similar to nearby H ii galaxies. The magnitude of R is\nclose to what was assumed by Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1998) and others for intermediate redshift BCGs.\nIn addition, R varies with H ii linewidth, departing dramatically from unity for W20 (H ii) \u2264 200\nkm s\u22121 . We have parameterized this relationship to help those who wish to attempt a correction in\nhigher redshift data. Unfortunately, there is no tight correlation between any of the morphological\nor photometric properties of these galaxies and the linewidth ratio, R. The upper limit of R does\nappear to decrease with increasing H\u03b1 equivalent width, suggesting that this effect is related to\ncentral starbursts in these galaxies, but this is tenuous conclusion. Applying the corrections due\nto inclination and converting from H ii to H i linewidth for our galaxies moves them onto the\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nTully-Fisher relation, leaving little room for these galaxies to fade if they are to remain on the\nrelation. This implies that the evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation from intermediate redshift to\nthe present day is smaller and more gradual than has been previously been suggested (e.g., Rix\net al. 1997).\nAlthough the luminosities, colors, and effective sizes of our sample were chosen to mimic\nthose of the BCG population at intermediate redshifts, our sample remains heterogeneous and\nonly samples a portion of the properties of BCGs. Of the 11 galaxies we observed, only 7 can\nbe classified as BCGs based on the definition of Jangren et al. (2001). Only the brightest 4 of\nthose 7 BCGs are classified as LBCGs. Furthermore, our galaxies have systematically smaller\nlinewidths than the observed population of intermediate redshift BCGs. They also tend to have,\non average at a given luminosity, smaller sizes. Therefore our sample is not representative of all\nintermediate redshift BCGs, but only a subset of them. As such, we are limited in what we can\ninfer regarding the properties of the distant BCGs. For those intermediate redshift BCGs with\nsmall velocity widths and sizes, we can assume that they will form also a heterogeneous population\nof relatively gas rich galaxies (\u223c109 M\u2299 ) whose gas fractions (fgas = 0.02 \u2212 0.5) and gas depletion\ntimescales (\u03c4gas = 0.2 \u2212 6 Gyrs) may span well over one order of magnitude. Although it is not\npossible to constrain the evolutionary descendants of these BCGs from the present data, we can\nremark that the relatively large dynamical and H i masses measured for about two-thirds of our\nsample will function to inhibit the ejection of the ISM and to fuel future star formation. Although\nthe current bursts of star formation are strong, they are unlikely to be the last, nor may they\nproduce the dominant stellar population in many of these galaxies. The remaining one-third of\nour sample shows, however, gas depletion timescales short enough to suggest that they may cease\nstar formation in the near future and thus may be good candidates to undergo subsequent passive\nevolution.\nFuture work on this topic is essential. Higher spatial resolution H i data will help us resolve\nany confusion regarding the interpretation of our single-dish observations. It will also allow us to\nprobe the internal structure of these galaxies to better understand how the effects of interactions\nmay be affecting our calculated masses. Observations of the molecular gas in these galaxies will help\ndetermine the total gas mass available for star formation in these galaxies. Finally, observations\nof a much larger sample which is more representative of the BCG class at intermediate redshift is\nnecessary to better infer the properties of their distant counterparts. This is the only way to divine\nthe gaseous properties of the intermediate redshift BCGs until we are capable of observing them\ndirectly.\n\n7.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank the staff at the Arecibo Observatory for all their assistance and hospitality\nduring our observations there.

Filled circles denote our sample, crosses denote the sample of\nspiral & irregular galaxies studied by Kobulnicky & Gebhardt (2000), open triangles denote the\nspiral sample of Raychaudhury et al. (1997), and open squares are the H ii galaxies from Telles &\nTerlevich (1993) with H i widths as measured by Smoker et al. (2000). The measured H ii-to-H i\nratio departs systematically from unity for galaxies with small H ii linewidths. The solid line is an\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n5\napproximate fit to the data: WH ii /WH i = 1 \u2212 5WH\nii \u2212 500WH ii \u2212 2.5 \u00d7 10 WH ii The boxes\nat the top of the figure illustrate the range of velocity widths measured for compact galaxies in the\nHubble Deep Field flanking fields (Phillips et al. 1997), z \u223c 0.6 field galaxies (Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al.\n1999), z \u223c 0.25 field galaxies (Rix et al. 1997), and compact blue galaxies at z \u223c 0.4 (Guzm\u00e1n\net al. (1998). Our sample of compact blue galaxies have WH ii /WH i \u223c 0.6 similar to the ratio\nfor H ii galaxies studied by Telles & Terlevich (1993). This effect is capable of reducing the T-F\noffsets found at intermediate redshifts by some studies.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Diagnostic parameters of the nearby galaxy sample (filled circles), illustrating the relation\nbetween linewidth ratio, (W20 (H ii)/W20 (H i)), H\u03b1 equivalent width, EW (H\u03b1), and concentration\nindex, C. The nearby irregular galaxy NGC 4449, marked by a star, is included as a comparison\nobject. Objects with high EW (H\u03b1) tend to have the smallest H ii/HI linewidths, although the\ndispersion is large.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- A comparison of MH i and LH\u03b1 (upper left panel), \u03c4gas and LH\u03b1 (upper right panel),\nand MH i and \u03c4gas (lower right panel) for the UCM BCG analogs (filled circles) and a sample of\nspiral galaxies from Kennicutt et al. (1994; crosses). It is evident that the two samples of galaxies\noccupy a similar region of parameter space in all three plots, although a couple of UCM galaxies\ndo have much shorter \u03c4gas than the Kennicutt et al. (1994) sample. The upper limit of MH i and\n\u03c4gas for UCM 2351+2321 is off the left side of the plot.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- A comparison of the sample galaxies (filled circles) with the same intermediate-redshift\nBCGs (squares and triangles) from Figure 1. The left panel compares the velocity dispersion with\nabsolute blue magnitude (MB ). The right panel compares the emission line velocity dispersion,\n\u03c3H ii , (not corrected for inclination) with the logarithm of the effective radius (Ref f ). The velocity\ndispersion is measured via the H\u03b2 line for our sample, and via a combination of H\u03b2, [O II], and\n[O III] linewidths for the intermediate redshift BCGs. Our sample galaxies have smaller velocity\ndispersions than the intermediate redshift BCGs, on average.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Diagnostic parameters including color (B-V), B-band surface brightness (SBe in mag\narcsec\u22122 ), concentration index (C), and asymmetry (A). Filled circles denote our sample, open\nsymbols denote nearby galaxies from the Frei (1999) catalog taken from Bershady et al. (2000).\nCrosses and upside-down 'Y's denote the BCG collection of Jangren et al. (2000). Note that our\nsample of nearby compact galaxies shares a unique space in these diagrams with the intermediateredshift BCGs, indicating that analogs of the intermediate-redshift compact galaxies can be found\namong our sample.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Comparison between our sample galaxy kinematics (circles), H ii galaxies (crosses) from\nTelles & Terlevich (1993) and the canonical Tully-Fisher relation (solid line: MB = \u22126.86 log(WR )\u2212\n2.27 from Pierce & Tully 1988). The raw H ii velocity widths (dashed circles) for our sample are\nmost consistent with the locus of the H ii galaxies. The H i velocity widths (open circles) are closer\nto the Tully-Fisher relation. But the inclination-corrected H i velocity widths (filled circles) are\nconsistent with the Tully-Fisher without any luminosity offsets. The dashed curve shows how the\nT-F relation would be modified if measured using inclination-corrected optical line-widths, based\non the relation adopted in Fig. 5.\n\n\f"}
