The Eruption on August 24, 2002\nOn August 24, 2002, active region (AR) 10069 was near the western limb of the Sun (W81)\nwhen it produced a powerful (X3.1) flare associated with a fast and wide coronal mass\nejection (CME). This event has been well studied due to extensive observations remotely\nby SoHO/LASCO and SoHO/UVCS (Raymond et al. 2003) as well in-situ by the Wind\nand ACE spacecraft among others and also its inclusion as one of the Solar Heliospheric\nInterplanetary Environment (SHINE) campaign events. Based on LASCO observations,\nthis was an instance of wide and fast CME, with an average speed of 1,900 km s\u22121 within\nthe first 20 solar radii. This event has been mostly studied in association with another\nwide and fast CME on April 21, 2002 for its association with a large Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) event (Tylka et al. 2005, 2006). Based on an increased of the iron-tooxygen ration at large energy, these authors proposed that the shock geometry explain\nthis difference: quasi-perpendicular for the August 24 and quasi-parallel for the April\n21 one. The presence or absence of a reflecting boundary at or slightly ahead of Earth\nassociated with a previous eruption has also been recently proposed to explain these\ndifference (Tan et al. 2008).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLugaz, Roussev & Sokolov\n1.2. Studying Western-Limb Ejections\n\nWestern limb events such as the August 24 and April 21, 2002 CMEs present a number\nof challenges for space weather prediction. Due to the Parker's spiral, the Earth is on\naverage magnetically connected with regions at the solar surface around W55 (for a\n400 km s\u22121 background wind). Therefore, SEP events are preferentially associated with\nwestern events. Events such as the April 21, 2002 and August 24, 2002 present additional\nchallenges since the SEP arrival time at Earth corresponds to a particle release height\nof less than 5 R\u2299 . If one believes that these particles are accelerated by the CME-driven\nshock wave, there are a number of scenarios to explain the observations. First, the shock\nmust have formed low in the corona, and then, within 5 R\u2299 of the solar surface, it either\nspans at least 60\u25e6 , or is smaller but it must have been significantly deflected towards\nthe east, or the magnetic field line connecting Earth to the solar surface significantly\ndiverges from the nominal Parker's spiral. Such differences of up to 30\u25e6 during SEP\nevents between flare cites and the magnetic footpoint of the Earth on the solar surface\nhave been reported before (Ippolito et al. 2005).\nWestern limb events are often associated with shock and sometimes ejecta at 1 AU.\nBoth August 24 and April 21, 2002 were associated with a shock wave at 1 AU which\ntransited in about 55 hrs. Among large geomagnetic storms (Dst 6 -100 nT) from the\npast solar cycle (Zhang et al. 2008), at least 6 were caused by a shock at Earth associated\nwith an ejection western of W73. This fact, again, seems to imply either a very large span\nof the shock wave, a large deflection of the CME, or a combination of both.\nUntil now, it has been hard to study observationally the deflection of a CME in the\ncorona or in the heliosphere due to the paucity of observations, especially in the nearEarth environment. Tripathi et al. (2004) reported deflection up to 20\u25e6 within the first\nhour after the initiation of an eruption based on a series of LASCO images. Shock span\ncan also be estimated with white-light images, but it is limited by assumptions of symmetry and geometrical effects (Cremades et al. 2006). In these two examples, the determination of the CME span and deflection can be only be made for limb CMEs and\nonly in the meridional direction. Additionally, the longitudinal extent of shocks can be\nestimated from multiple-spacecraft measurements; but until the launch of STEREO, it\ncould only be done with spacecraft at different heliospheric distances, for example by\nthe Helios spacecraft in the 1980s (DeLucas et al. 2008). The launches of STEREO and\nSMEI have also made 3-D tomography of CME easier (Jackson & Hick 2002). On the\ntheoretical and numerical sides, previous studies have focused on the deflection of a CME\nin the heliosphere due to its interaction with the solar wind (Wang et al. 2004). Here,\nbased on a 3-D numerical simulation of the August 24, 2002 event, we discuss how, by\nusing a new and realistic model of solar eruptions associated with a realistic model of\nthe coronal magnetic field, we can study these different effects.\n\n2. Simulation Setup\n2.1. Numerical Domains\nIn our numerical model, the steady-state solar corona and solar wind are constructed\nfollowing the methodology of Roussev et al. (2003), further described in Roussev et al.\n(2007). The initial condition for the coronal magnetic field is calculated by means of\npotential field extrapolation, following Altschuler et al. (1977), with boundary condition\nfor the radial magnetic field at the Sun, BR , provided by full-disk SoHO/MDI observations taken four days before the eruption when the AR was closer to the disk center and\nbetter observed. The \"solar\" boundary in our model is placed at a height of 0.1 R\u2299 above\n\n\fJD 11. Aug. 24, 2002 CME\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Magnetic topology before (left) and after (right, t = 20min) the shearing phase. The\nsolar surface is color-coded with the radial magnetic field strength and the magnetic field lines\nwith the radial velocity for the right panel. The null point and quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) are\nvisualized as white isosurfaces of plasma beta equal to 0.15 left) and 0.4 (right).\n\nthe photosphere. The plasma parameters are prescribed in an ad-hoc manner, through\na variable polytropic index, in order to mimic the physical properties of streamers and\ncoronal holes once a steady-state (non-potential) is reached.\nThe time-dependent MHD equations for a single compressible fluid are solved using\nthe Space Weather Modeling Framework (T\u00f3th et al. 2005) using two physical domain:\nthe Solar Corona (SC):, {\u221220 6 x 6 20, \u221220 6 y 6 20, \u221220 6 z 6 20} R\u2299 and Inner\nHeliosphere (IH): {\u2212220 6 x 6 220, \u2212220 6 y 6 220, \u2212220 6 z 6 220} R\u2299. We prescribe\nthe initial grid in a way such as AR 69 is resolved with cells as small as 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 R\u2299 , 4\ntimes finer than the rest of the solar surface. Additionally, the radial direction above the\nactive region (resp. direction of the field lines connecting to Earth) is refined with cells\nof 0.08 R\u2299 up to 8 (resp. 5) R\u2299 and 0.16 R\u2299 up to 14 (resp. 10) R\u2299 . The total number\nof computational cells is of the order of 1.77 and 14.66 millions, with largest meshes of\nsize 1.25 R\u2299 and 3.44 R\u2299 for SC and IH, respectively.\nTo the initial magnetic field constrained by SoHO/MDI data, we superimposed newly\nemerged magnetic flux simulated by a dipolar magnetic field of two point charges. These\ntwo charges are initially separated by 5 \u00d7 103 km and buried at a depth of 3 \u00d7 104 km\nunder the solar surface, and chosen so that the peak value of the radial magnetic field at\nthe solar surface is about 47 Gauss.\n2.2. Solar Eruption Model\nTo initiate the eruption, we use the model described in Roussev et al. (2007). To summarize, once the steady-state is reached at t = 0, the two magnetic charges are moved\napart quasi-steadily up to t = tS = 20 min with a speed which is ramped up in tS /3 to\n80 km s\u22121 ; the charge motion is stopped at t = tS .\nIn addition to updating the radial component of the dipole field at the boundary, we\nalso impose the accompanying horizontal boundary motions. As the result of moving\nthe charges apart, the magnetic field lines connecting the two spots of the dipole are\nstretched. With appropriate choice of parameters describing the relative position of the\ncharges, their strength and speed of motion, one can achieve a quasi-steady magnetic\nfield evolution toward a state that is no longer stable. Then, as the result of loss of\nconfinement with the overlying field, the \"energized\" magnetic field of the dipole erupts,\nmanifesting a CME.\n\n\f4\n\nLugaz, Roussev & Sokolov\n\nFigure 2. Field lines connecting to the vicinity of Earth and their evolution during the early\nphase of the eruption. The solar surface is color-coded with the radial magnetic field strength.\nNote the change of connectivity of one of the field lines at t = 20 min which connect AR 10069\nto Earth. Note also the propagation of the shock wave along the field lines at later times.\n\n3. Eruption and Coronal Evolution\n3.1. Loss of Equilibrium\nOne of the main results of the work in Roussev et al. (2007) was to recognize the importance of the pre-existing magnetic topology in the initiation of the eruption. This is first\nand foremost because reconnection at the pre-existing null points and quasi-separatrix\nlayers (QSLs) enables the sheared and energized magnetic flux of the dipole to erupt.\nThis work was the continuation and adaptation to realistic background coronal magnetic fields of previous works by Antiochos et al. (1999); Galsgaard et al. (2005) and\nPontin & Galsgaard (2007). There are two main pre-existing topological features important to understand this eruption: a null point between ARs 10067 and 10069 and a QSL\nbetween ARs 10066, 10068 and 10069 (the magnetic topology before the shearing phase\nis illustrated in the left panel of Figure 1). Noteworthy is the fact that there are open\nfield lines originating from AR 10069 and AR 10067 which pass at proximity of the null\npoint.\nDuring the shearing, current builds up along the loops connecting the two magnetic\nspots of the dipole and the magnetic field lines expand until they reconnect with overlaying field through the QSL. The QSL is disrupted and becomes a current sheet which\nstarts erupting (as illustrated in the right panel of Figure 1). The erupting field lines\nare now connecting AR 10069 to ARs 10067 and 10066. As some of these field lines\n\n\fJD 11. Aug. 24, 2002 CME\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Left: Solar footpoints of the magnetic field lines connecting to the vicinity of Earth,\nwhich span from S15W05 to N20W75. Right: Visualization of the shock wave 1 hour after the\nstart of the shearing phase. Field lines connecting to Earth's vicinity are shown with darker grey\nand larger radii. The white surface is an isosurface of Aflv\u00e9nic Mach equal to 1.\n\nexpand further, they reconnect though the null point and some of them open up. The\nmain motion of the erupting flux is radially above the initial position of the QSL but the\nreconnection through the null point between ARs 69 and 67 also enables the expansion\nof the CME towards solar east (Earth direction).\n3.2. Magnetic Connection to Earth\nThe August 24, 2002 eruption was associated with a large Solar Energetic Particle event,\neven though the magnetic connectivity to Earth is hard to assess due to the position of\nthe AR 81\u25e6 west of disk center. The timing of the arrival of SEPs at Earth is consistent\nwith particle release at less than 5 R\u2299 . Additionally, contrary to our model which is\nnot potential, the potential field source surface model (Altschuler et al. 1977) shows\nthat there are no open magnetic field lines originating from AR 69. Our simulation\ncan help explaining why a SEP event was indeed observed at Earth. We will not focus\non a given field line, but on a set of field lines spanning about 10\u25e6 at 1 AU including\nthe one connected to Earth on August 24, 2002 01UT. A number of reasons make the\ndetermination of the exact footpoint of the field line connected to Earth difficult and\ncompelled us to consider a stack of field lines instead. First, the solar magnetic field is\nreconstructed from observations on August 21, 2002, 3 days prior to the studied event and\nthe coronal and photospheric magnetic fields have certainly changed in this time span.\nSecond, as noted by Tan et al. (2008), the presence of prior ejections in the heliosphere\nmay significantly modify the magnetic connectivity. There was a number of ejections\nprior to the August 24 ones, alhough there was no clear ejecta passing Earth at this time\naccording to satellite data. Random walk of the field lines may also account for up to\n10\u25e6 longitudinal variation on the solar surface (Ippolito et al. 2005). Last, as can be seen\non the top left panel of Figure 2, field lines connecting to the vicinity of Earth before\nthe start of the shearing phase have footprints in two very distinct zones on the solar\nsurface through a QSL: one around N20W70 and one around S15W10. The \"average\"\nposition of the field lines connecting to Earth is about W40, indeed not departing too\nmuch from the nominal Parker's spiral. However, the magnetic topology close to the Sun\nis such that some of these field lines connect to the proximity of AR 69.\nAs described above, we find that, by the end of the shearing phase, the erupting flux\nhas reconnected with open magnetic field lines from AR 67 through the null point and\n\n\f6\n\nLugaz, Roussev & Sokolov\n\nFigure 4. Number density (left scaled by 1/R2 ) in the equatorial plane 29 hours (left) and\n48 hours (right) after the start of the shearing phase. The black circle represent Earth's orbit,\nEarth's position is shown with a white disk. The three lines are, from top to bottom the radial\ndirections corresponding to the central position of the eruption, the longitude reached at 58\nhours and the maximum longitudinal extent. The field line connecting to Earth is shown in\nwhite and the shock position is highlighted with the white ellipse.\n\nsome erupting field line are now direclty connected to Earth's vicinity. This can be seen in\nthe top right panel of Figure 2. The disruption of these field lines due to the passage of the\nshock wave can be seen at the later times. We find that the shock wave has been formed\nby 5 R\u2299 (within the first hour after the start of the shearing phase). It has also been\nsignificantly deflected due to reconnection at the northern null point. An approximate\nvisualization of the shock wave can be seen on the left panel of Figure 3 along with the\nfield lines connecting to Earth's vicinity. We should also note that the shock does not\nbecome quasi-parallel along Earth-connected field lines until about 90 minutes after the\nstart of the eruption (see also Roussev et al. 2008). A similar evolution of the shock angle\n(from quasi-perpenicular to quasi-parallel) with distance has been previously reported in\nManchester et al. (2005) for a field line about 37\u25e6 north of the center of the CME.\n\n4. Heliospheric Evolution and Results at 1 AU\nA shock wave associated with the eruption of August 24 was detected at Earth by\nACE spacecraft about 58 hours after the start of the eruption. In our simulation, the\nshock wave does not extend all the way to Earth. In fact, we find that the shock wave\nreaches 1 AU approximatively 42 hours after the end of the shearing phase about 60\u25e6\nWest of Earth. Its maximum angular span is about 120\u25e6 and it reaches a maximum of\n25\u25e6 West of Earth. After 58 hours, the simulated shock wave reaches a point about 35\u25e6\nWest of Earth. The results at 48 hours are shown on the right panel of Figure 4.\nIn agreement with previous studies (e.g. Jacobs et al. 2007), we find that there is no\nsignificative non-radial expansion of the CME in the heliosphere past the upper corona.\nAlthough in our simulation the shock wave does not hit Earth, we find that there is\ndirect magnetic connection between the flank of the shock and Earth during most of the\nheliospheric evolution of the CME and its associated shock. This is illustrated at time 29\nhours in the left panel of Figure 4 and may have important consequences to understand\nand predict the observed Forbush decrease of ACRs (Eroshenko et al. 2008) and the time\nvariation of the SEP event.\n\n\fJD 11. Aug. 24, 2002 CME\n\n7\n\n5. Discussions and Conclusion\nWe performed a Sun-to-Earth simulation of the August 24, 2002 CME event with a\nrealistic CME initiation mechanism (Roussev et al. 2007). This is one of the first solarterrestrial simulation involving a CME model more complex than a flux rope or a simple\nperturbation added onto the solar wind. Using a realistic model is required to study\nspace weather effect such as (i) the formation of the shock wave, (ii) the change of\nconnectivity between the Earth and the solar surface during the eruption, and (iii) the\npossible deflection of the CME. We find that reconnection of the erupting flux at one\nnull point north-east of the active region results in the deflection of the eruption in the\ncorona (we find no subsequent deflection in the heliosphere) towards the Sun-Earth line.\nThere is an opening of part of the erupting flux due to this reconnection event, and,\nconsequently, a change of magnetic connectivity with Earth. We find that the shock\nwave has formed by 5 R\u2299 and has a sufficient longitudinal extent to accelerate particles\nalong Earth-connected field lines.\nLast, we must investigate why, in our simulation, the shock does not reach Earth. First,\ncontrary to what was inferred by Wang et al. (2004), we find no consequent deflection of\nthe CME in the heliosphere, even though it is a fast western CME. This might be because\nthe solar wind is not well reproduced. Or it might be because there is in fact no significant\ndeflection of CME in the heliosphere. If we believe that there is no large deflection in the\nheliosphere, then the shock angular extent must be at least 170\u25e6 to explain the detection\nof the shock wave by ACE, significantly larger than what is predicted by our model. It is\nworth noting that the simulated CME is slower in the corona than the observed one by\nas much as 35%; a faster CME will most likely be associated with a larger shock wave.\nWe will investigate this in future simulations of the same event. In situ observations by\nSTEREO (and Helios) and future polar coronagraphs will provide valuable information\nconcerning the angular extent of shock wave, and possible deflection.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research for this manuscript was supported by NSF grants ATM0639335 and\nATM0819653 and NASA grants NNX07AC13G and NNX08AQ16G.\nReferences\nAltschuler, M.
