But the classical theory should be derived from\nQED rather than used as a starting point to quantize the EM field. When approached in this manner, these equations\nbecome approximate, govern the expectation values of the EM field and the electric current, and are the subject of\nan infinite hierarchy of quantum corrections.\nThe degrees of freedom common in quantum and classical physics are the expectation values of local fields. But we\nhave to keep in mind that such expectation values are not necessarily classical. The crucial quantity which controls\nthe classicality of the field expectation value is the number of degrees of freedom N = n\u03be 3 within the internal distance\nscale of the field, the correlation length \u03be of a many-body system at particle density n. The UV cutoff \u039b, the maximal\nenergy scale of QED, will be kept large but finite in this work: therefore, the internal scale of the field expectation\nvalue \u03be > 1/\u039b may fall into the quantum or classical domain, depending on initial conditions and external sources. For\nN \u223c 1 the local expectation value does not follow the laws of classical physics and will be called a subclassical field.\nSuch fields are used for instance in the density functional method [5]. These fields are useful to monitor the quantumclassical transition because they bridge the gap between observables and expectation values, used on the microscopic\nand macroscopic domain, respectively. This can be seen simplest within the framework of the renormalization group\nwhere the classical action governing the dynamics of the subclassical field can be set as an initial condition for the\nintegration of the renormalization group equations in the macroscopic domain. This point of view motivated this work,\nthe study of some necessary ingredients of the quantum-classical transition by means of the dynamics of subclassical\nfields. It includes the study of the dynamical origin of decoherence [1, 2] and consistency [3], the breakdown of the\ntime reversal invariance [4] and the way the expectation values are formed at the microscopic scale.\nA reassuring feature of subclassical fields is that their dynamics is stable and well defined in the UV. In fact,\nthe particles can not be localized with a precision better than their Compton wavelength therefore the subclassical\nfields are smeared out at shorter distances. This scale is independent of the underlying quantum field theory. The\nsubclassical field is classical in the sense that quantum fluctuations are averaged out. But it is still in the quantum\ndomain due to its fine spatial resolution because the decoherence within this space region is not strong enough to\nrestore classical probabilities, in particular, the additivity for exclusive events.\nThe present work is the continuation of the program outlined in Ref. [20] where the equations of motion for\nthe expectation value of the EM field and the electric current were discussed in QED. We go beyond that work\nand render that approach more realistic by including a reservoir of charges at finite density and by calculating\nexplicitly and by interpreting the vacuum polarization effects in the equation of motion for the EM field and in\ndecoherence/consistency. The loop expansion will be employed to include the vacuum polarization effects and we\nshall be satisfied by calculating the leading order, one-loop approximation to the linearized variational equations of\nmotion. The current terminology of the traditional construction of the averaged fields in classical electrodynamics can\nbe borrowed from the renormalization group method, it is a special blocking. In the present work we are satisfied by a\nsimpler realization of this idea, the coarse graining generated by the elimination of the charged degrees of freedom from\nthe dynamics without lowering the space resolution. The decoherence and consistency become simple perturbative\neffects in this setup, they are generated by the collective modes of the many-body vacuum. The dynamical breakdown\nof the time reversal invariance can be traced back to the collective modes as well, it is driven by the finiteness of\nthe life-time of the quasiparticles. Both the decoherence/consistency and dynamical breakdown of the time reversal\n\n\f2\ninvariance are actually generated by the same piece of the photon polarization tensor. This is how the dynamical\nbreakdown of the time reversal invariance and decoherence appear coupled in the classical limit. Note that there is\nno need of a particular definition of pointer states in this procedure, quasiparticles arising form our coarse graining\nprovide a natural, dynamically generated robust basis in the Fock space for the study of the reduced density matrix.\nThe breakdown of the time reversal invariance brings the boundary conditions in time into the foreground. The\nother goal of this work is the establishment of the dynamical symmetry breaking and its clear separation from the\nexplicit breakdown by the boundary conditions in time. The not entirely trivial issue of the latter is the way the\nexternal sources rearrange the radiation field in the variation principle to comply with the given boundary conditions.\nThe simplest way to regulate the corresponding formal, 0/0 terms in the equations of motion is the introduction of\nthe usual i\u01eb term in the quadratic part of the action in classical field theory, as well as in its quantum counterpart.\nThe quantum corrections to the space-time dependence of the averages of local observables are usually calculated\nby means of the linear response formalism. We need a more powerful method, capable of dealing with the eventual\nnonperturbative issues of the quantum-classical crossover regime to arrive at a reliable description of quantum effects,\nturning classical electrodynamics into QED at short distances. The Closed Time Path (CTP) method developed by J.\nSchwinger [6] provides us with a nonperturbative setting not only for the determination of the space-time dependence\nof local observables but for other key ingredients of the quantum-classical transition, to the reduced density matrix\nand the possible dynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance, too.\nThe CTP method has been extended a number of times [7\u201315]. Despite being the only way of obtaining expectation\nvalues as opposed to transition amplitudes reproduced by conventional quantum field theory its inherent algebraic\ncomplications somehow limited its applications. The generator functional for connected Green functions, our starting\npoint given by Eq. (7) below is closely related to the influence functional introduced in Ref. [16]. One may simple\nsay that all that is presented below is the application of the influence functional scheme to derive the effective action\nand the equations of motion for the expectation value of local operators. The solution of the latter provides us with a\npartial resummation of the perturbation series with rich physical content. Furthermore, certain details of the influence\nfunctional contain decoherence/consistency and irreversibility, the key conditions for the classical limit. The reduced\ndensity matrix and dissipative forces have been studied in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in a\nmanner reminiscent of the CTP formalism [17]. The unusual feature of quantum transition amplitudes, the possibility\nof fixing the initial and the final states of the motion has already been addressed in a manner, equivalent to the\nCTP formalism in Ref. [18]. The Schwinger-Dyson equation, the removal of the UV divergences, the equation of\nmotion for the EM field derived in the CTP formalism and the pair creation generated by a homogeneous external\nelectric field have already been thoroughly studied for a large number of charged fermions in Ref. [21]. Our results\nare complementary since they retain the adiabatic, IR tail of the vacuum polarization only. It is worth mentioning\nthat the problem of establishing variational equations for the expectation values [19] can be resolved by a suitable\nparametrization of the degrees of freedom [20]. The role of collective modes in the quantum-classical transition can\nconveniently be studied within the CTP scheme [22], as well.\nWe start in Section II with a short introduction of the CTP formalism, including the systematic construction of\nthe Heisenberg representation in terms of Green functions. Instead of following the historical route, the motivation of\nthis scheme by the calculation of the expectation values rather than transition amplitudes, an alternative argument is\npresented. The CTP formalism is motivated by the generalization of the classical action principle for initial condition\nproblems which produce the retarded solutions. Beside the CTP case we need the Open Time Path (OTP) version, as\nwell, to determine the reduced density matrix. Some functionals, used subsequently are introduced here, too, namely\nthose which generates the connected Green functions and their Legendre transform, the effective action.\nA rather general issue is addressed in Section III where a nonrenormalization theorem is shown for the Maxwell\nequations when all charges are included. One finds dressing only when charges are ignored. This result is in agreement\nwith the usual derivation of the dielectric constant and the magnetic permeability in classical electrodynamics.\nThe double-time formalism is introduced for QED in Section IV, followed by the calculation of the quadratic part\nof the generator functional for the connected Green functions and the effective action for the electric current and the\nEM field, as well as a short discussion of the ways the mass-shell modes of the photon and the zero modes of the\nfree EM field action satisfy the desired boundary conditions in time by formal, 0/0-type terms in the equations of\nmotion.The one-loop result for this functional is summarized in Section V.\nThe explicit calculation of the reduced density matrix for the EM field is carried out in Section VI. The real part\nof its logarithm controls the dielectric and the magnetic permeability functions and determines the quasiparticles, the\nimaginary part is responsible for the finite life-time of the quasiparticles, and the decoherence and the consistency of\nthe EM field. Finally, Section VII summarizes our conclusions.\nThe Appendixes contain some technical details. A short summary of the CTP propagators in the vacuum is\npresented in Appendix A, followed by the extension to thermodynamical equilibrium in Appendix B.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTIME ARROW AND THE DOUBLE-TIME FORMALISM\n\nThe dynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance is a provocative, not yet understood problem [4]. Weak\ninteractions set apart, the fundamental forces and dynamical equations of Nature are invariant under a reversion of\nthe direction of time. Nevertheless, daily experiences show that external perturbations influence the systems at later\ntimes only, and therefore the retarded solutions of the time reversal invariant equations of motion should be used. We\nset up our quadrature to solve the differential equations accordingly, by specifying the initial conditions. The resulting\nscheme obviously does not obey time reversal invariance. Such an explicit breakdown of the symmetry is a trivial\nphenomenon, the real, dynamical issue is the simplicity of the initial conditions, and the absence of the radiation field\nin electrodynamics or excited states, in general, in quantum mechanics.\nEven this trivial issue poses an interesting question. How can such an initial condition problem be dealt with\nin physics? The Newton equation, being a second order differential equation, requires two input data per degrees\nof freedom to fix a solution uniquely. For a differential equation we can choose freely among parameters of the\nmotion, either at the initial or at the final time. This allows us to treat problems where the initial or the final\ncondition is simple. A typical example is the use of the retarded or advanced Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials in classical\nelectrodynamics. But the fundamental, most flexible layer of classical mechanics is the variational principle where\nboundary problems can be defined only because the variation performed at the end point of the trajectory in an initial\nproblem cancels the generalized momentum. Such a shortcoming of the variation method is not a serious problem\nin classical dynamics since we can switch back to the canonical equations of motion anytime and set up the desired\nCauchy problem. The situation is more involved in quantum mechanics, where the action principle remains important.\nIn fact, after having set up a problem in the operator formalism, the actual calculation of the transition amplitudes\nor expectation values is usually done in the path integral formalism. Hence the goal of generalizing the variation\nprinciple to cope with retarded or advanced forces remains an important question.\nHow can we construct a variational method which automatically produces the retarded solution of the equations\nof motion? One should modify the procedure in such a manner that it is enough to provide the coordinates and the\nvelocities at t = ti , the beginning of the time evolution. But what does one do with the variation of the trajectory at\nthe final time t = tf ? A simple way to render the variation at the final time consistent with the classical trajectory\nis to cancel altogether its contribution to the equation of motion. This can be achieved by extending the dynamical\nproblem for twice as long as 0 \u2264 tCT P \u2264 2T = 2(tf \u2212 ti ). We follow the usual trajectory x+ (t) for the time interval T\nthen we flip the time arrow and follow the time backward along another trajectory x\u2212 (t), which returns to the initial\nconditions. The closed trajectory obtained in this manner is\n(\nx+ (ti + tCT P )\n0 \u2264 tCT P \u2264 T,\nCT P\nx\n(tCT P ) =\n(1)\nx\u2212 (2tf \u2212 ti \u2212 tCT P ) T \u2264 tCT P \u2264 2T.\nThe variation problem for such a time reversed trajectory is well defined, and it yields a trivial equation of motion\n0=0 for t = tf and produces the retarded solution. The quantum analogy of this scheme is well known, it is the CTP\nformalism of Schwinger [6]. We shall need a slight generalization of this scheme, the OTP fromalism [23] to access\nthe reduced density matrix of subsystems to cope with a genuine quantum effect, the decoherence.\nThe CTP formalism was originally developed as the standard perturbation expansion for expectation values in\nthe Heisenberg representation of Quantum Field Theory [6]. When Feynman's insight to QED, based on a simpler\nscheme of transition amplitudes became widely accepted, then the perturbation expansion for the expectation values\nwas gradually abandoned. This shift of attention seemed to be further justified by the simplicity and generality of the\npath integral representation of the transition amplitudes. The interest in the CTP formalism was kept in condensed\nmatter physics, where expectation values corresponding to given, time-dependent external perturbation are important.\nThe expectation value\nh\u03c8(t)|A|\u03c8(t)i = h\u03c8i |AH (t)|\u03c8i i,\n\n(2)\n\nobtained in the Heisenberg representation, where where AH (t) = ei(t\u2212ti )H Ae\u2212i(t\u2212ti )H and |\u03c8(ti )i = |\u03c8i i can be\nwritten as\nh\u03c8(t)|A|\u03c8(t)i = Tr[Ae\u2212i(t\u2212ti )H \u03c1i ei(t\u2212ti )H ].\n\n(3)\n\nin terms of the initial density matrix \u03c1i = |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |. This expectation value can be related in a simple manner to the\ntransition amplitude\nA = h\u03c8i |e\u2212i(tf \u2212t)H Ae\u2212i(t\u2212ti )H |\u03c8i i\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\nonly when the initial state |\u03c8i i is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. This condition is not met in a realistic situation\nwhere the initial state contains complicated, collective excitations. Expectation values like (3) will be obtained in\nthe CTP formalism, used in this work to derive the effective action whose Euler-Lagrange equation is satisfied by the\nexpectation values of the EM field and the electric current.\nA.\n\nGenerator functional for connected Green functions\n\nWe recall first some general features of the CTP formalism and next we introduce this scheme for QED. The\nexpectation value (3) motivates the introduction of the generator functional\neiW [j\n\n+\n\n,j \u2212 ]\n\n= TrT [e\u2212i\n\nR tf\nti\n\ndt\n\nR\n\nd3 x[H(x)\u2212j + (x)O(x)]\n\n]\u03c1i (T [e\u2212i\n\nR tf\nti\n\ndt\n\nR\n\nd3 x[H(x)+j \u2212 (x)O(x)]\n\n])\u2020\n\n(5)\n\nwhere j \u00b1 are two sources coupled to a local operator O and we use the units ~ = c = 1. This generator functional can\neasily be given in the path integral formalism. Indeed, the time evolution operator to the left of \u03c1i has the standard\npath integral representation. The same holds for the time evolution operator on the right except that the replacement\nj + \u2192 \u2212j \u2212 is carried out, as well. Note that the Hermitian conjugation of the operator standing to the right of \u03c1i\nleads to anti-time ordering. Consequently, the number of degrees of freedom is doubled, \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 will be used to\ndenote the CTP doublets, field trajectories for the left and right time evolution operator, respectively.

The initial condition \u03c1i = |0ih0| is used where |0i stands for the\nnoninteracting vacuum state with wave functional \u03a80 [\u03c6] and the trajectories \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 are joined at the final time\ndue to the trace operation in Eq. (5). The boundary conditions in time do not influence UV divergences therefore\nthe counterterms contained in SCT [\u03c6] are imposed separately for each time axes. It is not difficult to check that\nthe boundary conditions in time, used in Eq. (6) can be incorporated by the replacement S[\u03c6+ ] \u2212 S[\u03c6\u2212 ] \u2192 S[\u03c6\u0302] =\nS[\u03c6+ ] \u2212 S[\u03c6\u2212 ] + SBC [\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ] where SBC is a quadratic expression of the fieldsR taken at t =Rti and t = tf .

Note that the expectations\nvalues, calculated for unitary time evolution j + = \u2212j \u2212 are independent of the value of this final time tf as long as\nthey are considered before tf . The bonus of these apparent complications in the CTP formalism is a way to handle\nthe dynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance, decoherence and dissipative forces [20, 22].\nWe consider in this work elementary fermions of electric charge en , n being a flavor index, interacting with the EM\nfield.

The counterterm SCT will be suppressed below\nbecause it is given by the usual transition amplitude formalism.\nThe CTP propagators are introduced in Appendix A for free fields. The bosonic two-point functions, such as the\nphoton propagator, possess the structure\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012 n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD \u2212Df\n1 1\nD D+\u2212\n(12)\n=\nD\u0302 =\n+ iDi\n1 1\nD\u2212+ D\u2212\u2212\nDf \u2212Dn\ninvolving three real space-time dependent functions. It is an important property of radiative corrections that the\nself energies appearing in the quadratic generator functionals display the same structure and allows us to define the\ninteractive near and far field propagators. The actual calculation of the propagator for photons reveals that Dn\nand Df are the near and far field Green functions of classical electrodynamics, respectively. These propagators are\nusually introduced by splitting the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential of classical electrodynamics into an O(r\u22121 ) part and\nr\nan O(r\u22122 ) part and the retarded and advanced propagators are defined as Da = Dn \u00b1 Df . The propagator D\u0302 is\nsymmetric with respect to the exchange of its indices, cf. Eq. (A1). Therefore, the near and far field propagators\nf\nf\nn\nn\ncan be identified by the symmetric and antisymmetric part of the retarded Green function, Dab\n= Dba\n, Dab\n= \u2212Dba\n.\nAnother, more microscopic separation of these two Green functions, based on the quantum level, is mentioned at the\nend of this section. Finally, we shall find in Section IV C an additional, classical way to define the near and far field\npropagators.\nB.\n\nExpectation values of the EM field and electric current\n\nNotice that the unitarity of the time evolution assures that expectation values can be calculated in two different\nways, e.g.\nhAi =\n\n\u03b4W\n\u03b4W\n= \u2212\n\u03b4j + |\u0135=\u00e2=0\n\u03b4j |\u0135=\u00e2=0\n\n(13)\n\nand the final time tf plays no role as long as the expectation value is considered before it, x0 < tf , in the equations\nabove. Such a noncompact R symmetry, called the CTP symmetry, suggests the re-parametrization [20]\na\u00b1 =\n\na\n(1 \u00b1 \u03ba) \u00b1 \u0101,\n2\n\nj\u00b1 =\n\nhAi =\n\n\u03b4W\n\u03b4j |\u0135=\u00e2=0\n\nj\n(1 \u00b1 \u03ba) \u00b1 j\u0304\n2\n\n(14)\n\nof the external sources because we have\n(15)\n\nfor an arbitrary real value of \u03ba. The book-keeping sources a and j must be canceled after calculating the functional\nderivatives in order to recover the physical expectation values. On the contrary, the sources \u0101 and j\u0304 can be nonvanishing\nfor unitary time evolution and represent the devices which are supposed to drive the system adiabatically from the\nvacuum at t = \u2212\u221e to the desired initial state at t = ti . Eq. (15) shows that the fields coupled to a and j can be\nidentified by the physical fields because their averages reproduce the field expectation values. We shall see later that\nthe field coupled to the sources \u0101 and j\u0304 will be responsible for decoherence.\nThe obvious difficulty of the construction of variational equations for the expectation values is the fact that we\nhave twice as many degrees of freedom in the CTP formalism as in the classical counterpart. This problem can be\novercome by considering the effective dynamics obtained by the elimination of a degree of freedom by its equation of\nmotion from each CTP doublet. But the preceding argument reveals an apparent problem in this plan. On the one\nhand, the reduplication of the degrees of freedom in the CTP formalism, A \u2192 A\u00b1 , produces two identical looking\nvariables as far as expectation values are concerned and it is not clear which one to eliminate. On the other hand,\ndecoherence, a mechanism not directly encoded by expectation values is related to the difference Ad = A+ \u2212 A\u2212 only.\nThere are different dynamical issues mixed in these variables. Therefore, it appears to be appropriate to go over the\n\n\f6\nKeldysh basis, (A+ , A\u2212 ) \u2192 (A, Ad ) = ((A+ + A\u2212 )/2, A+ \u2212 A\u2212 ) and eliminate Ad . But there is a new problem which\narises in this manner. In fact, it is not difficult to see that the dynamics of the field variable A and its canonically\n\u03b4\nconjugated momentum \u03a0 = \u2212i \u03b4A\nis contained in the dependence of A or Ad , respectively of the density matrix\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c1[A , A ]. The complete elimination of Ad removes all information about the momentum in the effective theory. But\nthe time dependence of the expectation value hAi can be used to reconstruct the expectation value h\u03a0i = \u22020 hAi. Thus\nAd should appear in the combination of A+ and A\u2212 to be retained in the effective theory. This condition is realized\nby the restriction \u03ba 6= 0 on the otherwise free parameter [20].\nThe effective action, a device used to derive the equation of motion for the expectation values, is usually the\nfunctional Legendre transform of W . This step must be slightly modified because the latter object is complex in the\ndouble-time formalism. Since W = 0 for the physical case with unitary time evolution we define the effective action\nas the Legendre transform of the real part of W ,\n\u02c6 \u00c2] + \u00e2J\u02c6 + \u0135 \u00c2,\nRW [\u00e2, \u0135] = \u0393[J,\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\u03b4W\nJ\u02c6 =\n,\n\u03b4\u00e2\n\n\u00c2 =\n\n\u03b4W\n,\n\u03b4 \u0135\n\n(17)\n\nby using the external sources a\u00b1 and j \u00b1 . The inverse transformation, Eq. (16) and\n\u00e2 = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4 J\u02c6\n\n\u0135 = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n\u03b4 \u00c2\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nappear as variational equations of motion satisfied by the fields J\u02c6 and \u00c2. It is advantageous to find the effective\naction for the expectation values. To this end we write\n \u0304 A, \u0100] = RW [\u00e2, \u0135] \u2212 aJ \u2212 \u0101J \u0304 \u2212 jA \u2212 j\u0304 \u0100\n\u0393[J, J,\n\n(19)\n\nby means of the parametrization (14) and\nJ=\n\n\u03b4RW\nJ \u0304 =\n,\n\u03b4\u0101\n\n\u03b4RW\n,\n\u03b4a\n\nA=\n\n\u03b4RW\n,\n\u03b4j\n\n\u0100 =\n\n\u03b4RW\n.\n\u03b4 j\u0304\n\n(20)\n\nThe inverse transformation,\na=\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4J\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n\u0101 = \u2212  \u0304,\n\u03b4J\n\nj=\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4A\n\nj\u0304 =\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4 \u0100\n\n(21)\n\nrepresents the Euler-Lagrange equations. The fields J and A stand for the expectation values and the auxiliary fields\nJ \u0304 and \u0100 incorporate the effects of quantum fluctuations.\nThe imaginary part IW , left out from the construction of the our effective action is important in establishing\ndecoherence. In fact, decoherence stands for the suppression of the off diagonal elements of the density matrix in\nthe pointer representation. By assuming that the field variables J and A are good pointer variables decoherence\ncorresponds to the suppression of the absolute magnitude of eiW [\u00e2,\u0135] as J \u0304 and \u0100 are increased. Such a suppression\ncomes from IW [\u00e2, \u0135].\nFinally, one can construct an effective action for the physical expectation values only,\n\u0393[J, A] = RW [a, \u0101, j, j\u0304] \u2212 aJ \u2212 jA\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nJ=\n\n\u03b4RW\n,\n\u03b4a\n\nA=\n\n\u03b4RW\n.\n\u03b4j\n\n(23)\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4A\n\n(24)\n\nThe inverse transformation,\na=\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n,\n\u03b4J\n\nj=\u2212\n\ngive the Euler-Lagrange equations for the expectation values only.\n\n\f7\nC.\n\nReduced density matrix\n\nWe have surveyed so far the means to find equations of motion for expectation values. The right-hand side of Eq.\n(3) is not sufficient for our other goal, for the calculation of the reduced density matrix. The reduced density matrix\nfor the EM field is obtained by eliminating the charged degrees of freedom and can be written as\n\u03c1[A(1) , A(2) ] = hA(1) |Trch [Ae\u2212i(t\u2212ti )H \u03c1i ei(t\u2212ti )H ]|A(2) i\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the trace operation is over the Fock space of the charged particles and the state |Ai is the eigenstate of the\nphoton field operator with field configurations A\u03bc (x) in the functional Schr\u00f6dinger representation. The generator\nfunctional of Eq. (8) for \u03c1[A(1) , A(2) ] will be given in the OTP formalism. It consists of a path integral where the\ncharged fields have a closed time path and the integration over the photon field is restricted to trajectories with open\n(1)\n(2)\n\u2212\nend points A+\n\u03bc (tf , x) = A\u03bc (x) and A\u03bc (tf , x) = A\u03bc (x).\nThe OTP formalism displays entanglement of subsystems in a specially clear manner. Let us consider for instance\nQED as a closed system, described by a factorizable, pure state at the initial time. The interactions generate\nentanglement between the charges and the EM field; the charges considered alone will be found in a mixed state and\ntheir reduced density matrix can be obtained by eliminating the EM field. The contributions of the perturbative\nintegration over the EM field configurations are labeled by graphs. Those which contain photon lines connecting the\ntwo time axes represent mixed state contributions. In fact, the integration over the momentum of these lines produces\nthe sum of pure state contributions to the reduced density matrix. The structure (12) of the photon propagator\nreveals that the near field is responsible for the interactions within a time axis. These elementary processes contribute\nto the self energy and preserve the purity of the charge states. The far field connects the two time axes and represents\nthe mixing resulting from the entanglement of the charge-EM field subsystems.\nThe perturbative evaluation of the generator functional of Eq. (7) implies a strong limitation. The naive perturbation expansion relies on the translation invariance of the vacuum, allowing weak inhomogeneous components in the\nexternal sources. This is enough to support sufficiently inhomogeneous field expectation value profiles when there is\nno gap in the excitation spectrum above the vacuum, such as in the case for a system of charges at finite density.\nBut once the localized states arise through a gap in the spectrum then the weak external inhomogeneities are not\nsufficient to produce localized states on the mass-shell. In fact, all we achieve at finite temperature and vanishing\ncharge density is a weak inhomogeneous vacuum polarization by virtual pairs. The creation of states with few on-shell\nlocalized charges remains a nonperturbative issue in this formalism [20].\nIII.\n\nFLUCTUATIONS AND DRESSING\n\nBoth the external, classical source \u0135 and the dynamical current h0|\u0135|0i = J\u02c6 generate vacuum polarization. The\nsimple structure of the QED action allows us to compare these two polarizations. To this end we consider the\nexpectation value of the EM field induced by weak external and dynamical, quantum currents. We shall seek the\nlinearized expression for the EM field. The result will be equally valid for the transition amplitude formalism or for\nany double-time functionals. The integration over the fermion fields in the generator functional (8) yields\nZ\n\u22121\nc\ni\neiW [\u00e2,\u0135] = D[\u00c2]eiW [\u00e2\u2212e\u03c3\u0302 \u00c2]+ 2 \u00c2D\u03020 \u00c2+i\u0135 \u00c2\n(26)\nwhere \u03c3\u0302 denotes flipping the sign of the \u2212 component of CTP doublets\n\u0012 +\u0013 \u0012 + \u0013\nA\nA\n,\n=\n\u03c3\u0302\n\u2212A\u2212\nA\u2212\nthe generator functional of non-interacting fermions is denoted by\nX\nW c [\u00e2] =\nWn [\u00e2n ],\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nn\n\nwith\nWn [\u00e2] = \u2212iTr ln\n\n\u0014\n\n\u011c\u22121\n0n\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012 +\n/a 0\n+\n0 /a\u2212\n\n(29)\n\nbeing the generator functional for the connected Green functions of the current for the flavor n in the absence\nof electromagnetic interactions. Note that there are connected Green functions of arbitrarily high order for the\n\n\f8\nnoninteracting Dirac-see because the current is a composite operator. We perform the shift of the integral variable,\n\u00c2 \u2192 \u00c2 \u2212 D\u03020 \u0135, in other words, we use the equation of motion for the EM field to write\nZ\n\u22121\nc\ni\ni\neiW [\u00e2,\u0135] = e\u2212 2 \u0135 D\u03020 \u0135 D[\u00c2]eiW [\u00e2\u2212e\u03c3\u0302(\u00c2\u2212D\u03020 \u0135)]+ 2 \u00c2D\u03020 \u00c2\ni\n\n= eiW [\u00e2+e\u03c3\u0302 D\u03020 \u0135]\u2212 2 \u0135 D\u03020 \u0135 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwith\nW [\u00e2] = W [\u00e2, \u0135 = 0]\n\n(31)\n\nbeing the generator functional for the current in full QED. Therefore, we obtain the relation\n1\nW [\u00e2, \u0135] = W [\u00e2 + e\u03c3\u0302 D\u03020 \u0135] \u2212 \u0135 D\u03020 \u0135,\n2\n\n(32)\n\nthe reduction of the two-variable generator functional into a single variable functional. The simple form of the initial\nLagrangian allows us to separate the tree-level dependence on the source j and to place the loop-induced dependence\ninto the dressed fermion one-loop graphs. In doing so, we rely on the fact that the only part of the QED action which\ncontains higher-than-quadratic terms in the fields is the minimal coupling.\nThe natural use of such a reduction is the simplification of the equations of motion for the currents\n\u03b4W [\u00e2 + e\u03c3\u0302 D\u03020 \u0135]\nJ\u02c6n =\n\u03b4\u00e2n\n\n(33)\n\nand the EM field\n\u00c2 =\n\nX\nn\n\nen D\u03020 \u03c3\u0302\n\n\u03b4W [\u00e2 + e\u03c3\u0302 D\u03020 \u0135]\n\u2212 D\u03020 \u0135\n\u03b4\u00e2n\n\n(34)\n\nwhich can be written as\n\u00c2 = D\u03020 (\u03c3\u0302etr J\u02c6 \u2212 \u0135)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere e denotes a flavor column vector made up of the electric charges, etr = (e0 , e1 , * * * ).\nThe external sources \u00e2n and \u0135 are the independent variables in these equations. When the functional Legendre\ntransformation is performed then J\u02c6n and \u00c2 become independent variables but the equations remain valid by considering \u0135 and \u00e2n as dependent variables. Comparing Eq. (35) with the second equation in Eqs. (18) the exact result\n[24]\nX\n\u02c6 \u00c2] = \u0393mech [J]\n\u02c6 + 1 \u00c2D\u0302\u22121 \u00c2 \u2212 \u00c2\u03c3\u0302\n\u0393[J,\nen J\u02c6n\n0\n2\nn\n\n(36)\n\nfollows. Here the first term represents the mechanical contribution of the Dirac-see and plays the role of an integration\n\"constant\". There are two sources of complexities in the dynamics, the implications of the Pauli exclusion principle for\nthe electric current as a composite operator and the electromagnetic interactions. The latter has a small parameter, ~\nor e2 to organize a systematical approximation scheme but the former type of dynamical correlations admit no small\nparameter and induce arbitrary high order connected Green functions for the non-interacting Dirac-see in Eq. (29)\nand arbitrary high order vertices in the effective action (36).\nThe lesson of Eq. (35) is rather surprising, it is the absence of renormalization in the nonmechanical part of the\ntheory. We shall see below, when a similar result is recovered in the loop-expansion, that this triviality results from\na cancellation between the two channels the source j can induce EM field. What is observed here is that the relation\namong the expectation values and the external current j is not renormalized because the former already includes all\nthe dressing. The nontrivial source of dressing according to Eq. (32) arises from the Green functions for the currents,\nthe structure of the functional W [\u00e2] of Eq. (31). The j dependence comes in a trivial manner, dictated by the minimal\ncoupling, gauge invariance.\nIt is instructive to follow what happens with the vacuum polarization when we select the flavor n = 0 as our valence\ncharge, ev = e0 , and cancel the external source anb nb 6= 0 for the remaining flavors, called background charges. Let\nus introduce the notation \u00e2v = \u00e20 ,\n\u03b4W [\u00e2 + e\u03c3\u0302 D\u03020 \u0135]\n,\nJ\u02c6v =\n\u03b4\u00e2v\n\n(37)\n\n\f9\nand eb will denote the background charge vector, etr\nb = (0, e1 , * * * ). The polarization effects now arise from the\ndependence of the electric current of any flavor on the external sources \u00e2v and \u0135 and one can find these contributions\nby expanding Eq. (33) in \u00e2v and in \u0135. We have to keep in mind that the current of the valence charge, given by Eq.\n(37), includes all external source dependence and it is an independent variables of the effective action therefore, its\ndependence on j has already been accounted for. Thus the expansion can be restricted to the background charges\nwhich yields, after inserting it into Eq.

The first two terms on the\nright-hand side stand for the direct, tree-level part of Eq. (35) and the polarization effects are represented by the third\nand fourth terms in the linearized equation of motion. Recall that the external field \u00e2v is used only to generate the\nvalence current J\u02c6v . Therefore, \u00e2v in the third term should be expressed in terms of J\u02c6v when the relation between the\nvalence current and the EM field is sought. Thus this term represents the polarization effects due to the dependence\nof the background currents on the valence current. The last term shows the polarization due to the dependence of the\nbackground currents on the external current \u0135. These two terms are not directly incorporated in the valence current\ndynamics and they represent the dressing in the equation of motion when \u00e2v is expressed in terms of J\u02c6v . In other\nwords, the dressing in the Maxwell equation (38) is due to the fact that our experimentally monitored valence current\ndoes not cover all charges in the system. It is completely natural that the uncontrolled charges generate the dressing,\nwhich gives rise to the proportionality between the averaged and the local EM field.\nIV.\n\nEFFECTIVE ACTION\n\nAfter some general remarks we now turn to explicit loop-expansion expressions for the quadratic part of the\nfunctionals mentioned in the previous Section.\nA.\n\nConnected Green functions\n\nThe generator functionals of Eq.

This\nis not a dynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance, but rather a trivial result of the boundary conditions.\nIn fact, the open ended, null boundary condition at the final time leads to a destructive interference between the two\ntime axes which cancels the advanced field generated by the physical sources [20]. The book-keeping variables a and j\ngenerate an O(\u03ba) time reversal invariant near field, as a result of the equal coupling of these sources to the dynamical\nvariables of the two time axes by the \u03ba-dependent term in Eq. (14).\nAfter the formal manipulations we set a = j = 0 to regain the physical case with unitary time evolution. The\nauxiliary fields are vanishing in this case, cf. Eq.

We mention first a peculiar feature of the loop-expansion. The independent\nvariables of the generator functional for the connected Green functions W [\u00e2, \u0135] are the external sources \u00e2 and \u0135 which\nare classical, O(~0 ) quantities. The result is the well-known equivalence of the expansion in ~ and in the number of\nloops in the Feynman graphs in the connected Green functions. But in the present case the electric current J\u02c6 is O(~)\nand the expansion in ~ mixes different loop-orders in the effective action.\nThe Legendre transform of a quadratic functional remains quadratic, and the two kernels are the inverse of each\nother up to a sign. The inverse of the block matrices of the quadratic functionals of Eq. (45) can be obtained by\nperforming the change of variable of the Legendre transformation explicitly with the result\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n0\n0\nG\u0303a\u22121\nev\nJ\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ec A \uf8f7\n1\n0\nev\nDba\u22121\na\na \uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n(52)\n\u0393 = \u2212 (J, A, J , A ) \uf8ed r\u22121\n\uf8ed \uf8f8,\nG\u0303\nev\n\u2212\u03baG\u0303r\u22121 G\u0303n G\u0303a\u22121\n\u2212\u03ba(Pof f + G\u0303r\u22121 G\u0303n Pon )ev \uf8f8 J a\n2\na\nA\nev Dbr\u22121 \u2212\u03baev (Pon G\u0303n G\u0303a\u22121 + Pof f ) \u2212\u03ba(\u03a0nb Pon + Dbn\u22121 Pof f )\n\nThe operator Pon projects on to the photon mass-shell and Pof f = 11 \u2212 Pon . Some important properties of Dn\nand Df related to the mass-shell and used in the derivation are listed in Table I. For instance, the replacements\nD0r\u22121 D1n \u03a0nt (11 \u2212 D0n D0a\u22121 ) \u2192 0, D0r\u22121 D0n D0a\u22121 \u2192 Dbn\u22121 Pof f and \u03a0nb (11 \u2212 D0n D0a\u22121 ) \u2192 \u03a0nb Pon have been carried out\nin obtaining the O(Aa ) term in the effective action.

It corresponds to the equation of motion\nEq. (4.18) in Ref. [21] when the effects of the physical sources which drive the system adiabatically to the desired\ninitial state are incorporated implicitly in the propagators and the self-energy.\nThe auxiliary fields are not needed for the dynamics of the observable expectation values therefore, it is natural\nto seek the effective action involving the physical fields alone. To this end we consider \u0101 and j\u0304 as parameters in the\ngenerator functional of Eq. (49) and perform the functional Legendre transformation on a and j only, with the result\n!\n!\n1 (J,A) G\u0303n\u22121 \u2212ev\nJ\n\u03ba\u0393[J, A] =\n+ Ja\u2032\u2032v + Aj \u2032\u2032 ,\n(54)\n2\n\u2212ev Dn\u22121\nA\nwhere the inverse of the near field propagators is defined to be zero on the mass-shell.

(50) are satisfied. Notice the need for \u03ba 6= 0 to arrive at any variational scheme for the physical\nvariables only [20].\nWhat is the scale regime where the renormalization group treatment, performed in its complexity is supposed\nto preserve the form of these equations? The UV cutoff of the equations is the Compton wavelength because the\nvacuum polarization effects suppress the variation in the space-time within this distance scale. The infrared limitation\nis provided by the typical length scale of the state generated by the external sources, such as the de Broglie wave\nlength. In fact, the smearing of the configuration beyond this length scale modifies the space-time dependence and the\nequations of motion. Once the blocking scale passes the quantum-classical crossover one arrives at the true, classical\nequations supported by decoherence.\nC.\n\nRadiation field\n\nThe external sources or boundary conditions in time determine the radiation field in classical electrodynamics. The\nnon-trivial issue here is the realization of this well-understood circumstance within the variational principle. The point\nis that the radiation field enters, in a singular manner, into the variational scheme of the actions (54)-(55). The first\nsign of this complication is the vanishing of the near field propagator on the photon mass-shell due to the principal\nvalue prescription in its Fourier integral representation. Another way to see that the radiation field does not enter\ninto the quadratic part of the action is to recall the remark made after Eq. (12), namely that the far field propagator\nis antisymmetric thus the radiation field drops out entirely from the O(A2 ) part of the action. This state of affairs\nis in agreement with the formal time reversal symmetry of the elementary processes because the field operators act\nforward and backward in time by annihilating and creating elementary excitations.\nThe retarded propagators may appear in the O(Aj \u2032 ) terms of the action and are attached to the external sources.\nThe O(A2 ) part of the action controls the restoring force acting on the oscillation around the stable vacuum thus the\nexternal source induces a singular response on the mass shell, rendering the mass-shell radiation field nondynamical,\nto be settled by the boundary conditions in time. In fact, a simple way to arrive at the desired equations of motion\nwithout separating explicitly the on- and off-shell components of the equation as in Eqs. (53) is to write the source\nin Eq. (55) as j \u2032 = Dn\u22121 Aon and note that the equation of motion A = Aon contains the mass-shell component with\na formal 0/0 coefficient. This scheme is actually realized by the usual m2 \u2192 m2 \u2212 i\u01eb prescription for the free action\nwhen applied in classical field theory.\nWhen all fields arising from the reduplication of the degrees of freedom inherent in the double-time formalism are\nretained then the physical fields can be coupled to nonsymmetrical kernels. The result is the simple and natural\npreservation of the retarded and advanced solutions in the variational scheme. Such a treatment of the boundary\nconditions in time opens up possibilities to address the genuine, dynamical breakdown of time reversal invariance. For\ninstance, the friction forces signal in classical physics that the coupling of our system to its environment breaks the\ntime reversal invariance in a dynamical manner. Such kind of forces can easily be encoded in the variation principle\nof the double-time formalism. Another example is the dynamical building up of decoherence in a system due to a\ncoupling to its environment with a gapless spectrum, to be seen explicitly below.\nV.\n\nONE-LOOP POLARIZATION TENSOR\n\nWe return in this Section to the loop expansion and present the photon-polarization tensor in the one-loop approximation.

The latter is\nlinear in the Fermi-Dirac distribution function np = 1/{exp(\u03b2[\u01ebp \u2212 sign(p0 )\u03bc]) + 1}. As a result we have the similar\nseparation in the polarization tensor (60), which will be the sum of three kinds of terms. The vacuum contributions\nare independent of n. The O(n) terms contain a particle from the environment on the mass-shell. Finally, there will\nbe O(n2 ) terms where both particles come from the environment and are on the mass-shell.\nAs far as the environment is concerned, we shall have either finite temperature at vanishing density or finite\n\u02c6 = G\u0303\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\ndensity at vanishing temperature.

For each CTP index, covariance with respect to three-dimensional rotations\nsuggests that we use three three-dimensional scalars whose number is further reduced to two by gauge invariance.\n\u02c6 \u03bd\u03bc and B\u0302 = uG\u0303u.\n\u02c6 The final useful form is\nThese two sets of scalar are the easiest to obtain in terms of \u00c2 = g\u03bc\u03bd G\u0303\n!\n!\n1\n0 0\n1 n\u03bd\n\u02c6\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(64)\n+ [B\u0302q (1 \u2212 \u03bd ) \u2212 \u00c2q ]\n(G\u0303q ) = B\u0302q\n2\n0 T\nn\u03bd \u03bd 2 L\nwhere the space-time tensor structure is explicitly shown for the environment contributions with n = q/|q|, L = n\u2297n,\nT = 11 \u2212 L.\nThe expression (64) makes the space-time tensor structure explicit. The CTP index structure is contained in the\nLorentz-scalar CTP matrices \u00c2 and B\u0302 which will be detailed now. These matrices are the sum of the vacuum and\nenvironment contributions,\nX\u0302q = X\u0302vac,q + X\u0302env,q\n\n(65)\n\nwhere X stands for A or B. As far as the vacuum contribution is concerned in the framework of the gradient expansion\nit contains G\u0303++\u03bc\u03bd\nvac,q only which gives\n\u03b1 q2 2\nq\n(RB\u0302vac )q =\n15\u03c0 m2\n\n!\n(R\u00c2vac )q\n1 0\n=\n3(1 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )\n0 \u22121\n\n(66)\n\n\f14\nand I\u00c2vac = IB\u0302vac = 0 with the help of Eq.

The frequency integrals are carried out in Eqs.\n(67) by means of the residuum theorem, resulting in three-dimensional integration over the momentum p. By splitting\nthese integrals into two parts, corresponding to |p| < m and |p| > m and by finding an upper bound for the latter\ncontributions one can verify that the simple nonrelativistic expressions give reliable leading order approximations.\nWhat are the kinematical regions contributing to the various pieces of the two-point function for a nonrelativistic\nenvironment? At low temperature and vanishing charge density it is enough to retain the O(n) terms which decreases\nrapidly when |q| is increased. The situation changes drastically at finite density because the gap disappears in the\nexcitation spectrum. RX ++ , given in the first equation of Eq. (67) describes a particle-hole pair where one member\nof the pair belongs to the environment and is on the mass shell. It is advantageous to use the dimensionless ratio\nq 2 + 2\u03c9p q 0\n2|q|kch\n\n(69)\n\n(rkch )2\n(q + rkch n)2\n\u2212\n2m\n2m\n\n(70)\n\nr=\nwhich gives\n\u03c9\u2248\n\nindicating that the Pauli blocking allows particle-hole excitations at small q for |r| \u2248 1. Thus RX ++ is expected to\ntake larger values for q \u226a m at |r| \u2248 1 only. Both the particle and the hole are on the mass-shell in the remaining\nexpressions in Eqs. (67) because the time ordering is the only mechanism to produce off-shell amplitudes in the\nCTP propagators. The distribution function np restricts the integration approximately to |p| < kcr . The conditions\np2 = (p \u2212 q)2 = m2 for nonrelativistic four momentum p with p0 \u2248 m give rkcr = pn, the integration is over a plan,\northogonal to q. The largest area corresponds to r = 0 and the remaining functions in Eqs.

The expressions (72)-(75)\nare valid for nonrelativistic electron gas but naturally comprise the relativistic kinematics for photons.\n\n\f16\nVI.\n\nREDUCED DENSITY MATRIX\n\nWe use now the functional in Eq. (8) to obtain the reduced density matrix for the EM field. A single charged field\nis considered for simplicity and it will be treated by CTP boundary conditions and the OTP boundary conditions are\nused for the EM field. The generator functional in Eq. (8) with \u00e2 = \u0135 = 0, considered as a functional of the final field\nconfigurations gives the reduced density matrix\n\u0012Y\n\u0013 P\nZ\n\u2212\n/]\u03c8\u0302n + 2i \u00c2D\u03020\u22121 \u00c2\n\u02c6 ] ei n \u03c8\u0304\u02c6n [\u011c\u22121\n0n \u2212en \u03c3\u0302 \u00c2\n.\n(76)\n\u03c1[A+\n,\nA\n]\n=\nD[\n\u00c2]\n\u03c8\u0304\nD[\n\u03c8\u0302\n]D[\nn\nn\nf x\nf x\nn\n\nThe integration over the charged field can be carried out with the result\nZ\n\u2212\n\u03c1[A+\n,\nA\n]\n=\nD[\u00c2]eiSef f [\u00c2]\nf x\nf x\n\n(77)\n\nwhere the effective bare action is\nSef f [\u00c2] =\n\n1\n\u00c2(D\u03020\u22121 \u2212 \u03a0\u0302)\u00c2 + O(\u00c23 ),\n2\n\n(78)\n\n\u03a0\u0302 being given by Eq. (41). This functional integral contains information about the dynamics described by the density\nmatrix in a manner similar the path integral describes the transition amplitude between pure states in the single time\nformalism. The real part RS[\u00c2] is identical to \u0393[\u00c2], obtained as the Legendre transform of RW [\u00e2, \u0135] for \u00e2 = 0, it\ndetermines the expectation value of the EM field and will be used to extract the polarization induced by the charges.\nThe imaginary part controls the width of the peak in the reduced density matrix, and the decoherence and consistency\nof the EM field.\nThe normal modes of the quadratic part of the action in the path integral expression for the transition amplitudes\nare plane waves. It is easy to see that \u03a0\u0302q is not diagonalizable in the time axis index only. The normal modes of the\nCTP action (78) couple the wave vector q = (\u03c9, q) with the CTP index and are labeled by the wave vector, space-time\nand CTP indices. The dynamical role of each normal mode is characterized by three numbers,\nZ\n\u03a0n\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\u2212\ndxeiqx RihT [jx\u03bc j0\u03bd ]i,\nq\nZ\nf \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0q\n= \u2212 dxeiqx Rihjx\u03bc j0\u03bd i,\nZ\n\u03a0i\u03bc\u03bd\n=\ndxeiqx IihT [jx\u03bc j0\u03bd ]i,\n(79)\nq\n\u02c6 It is easy to check that the Fourier\nby applying the parametrization (12) for the current-current two-point function G\u0303.\nn\ni\nf\ntransforms \u03a0 and \u03a0 are real and \u03a0 is purely imaginary. In the one-loop approximation the real quantities arise\nfrom the interactions within a single time axis and the purely imaginary quantity corresponds to correlation between\nthe time axes. This correlation, realized by Green functions connecting the two time axes, arises because the charged\nparticles which are exchanged in the process represented by the Green functions are entangled with the EM field.\nWe shall consider these quantities in the (q, \u03c9) space. The zeros of \u03a0n\u03c9,q locate the mass-shell of the quasiparticles,\nrepresented by the normal modes of the diagonal, ++ or \u2212\u2212 blocks of the quadratic bare action. The imaginary\npart of the two-point function in the space-time, which is given by i\u03a0i\u03c9,q in Fourier-space, controls two, superficially\ndifferent dynamical processes. On the one hand, the decay of the quasiparticles, the inverse life-time of a quasiparticle\ncan be identified by \u03a0i\u03c9,q evaluated on the mass-shell. On the other hand, according to the structure displayed in Eq.\n(12), this parameterizes the suppression of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the reduced density matrix, realized by\nthe mode \u03c9, q of the path integral. Thus the consistency and decoherence of the quasiparticle modes on the mass-shell\nhave the same dynamical origin as the finite life-time of the quasiparticles. This is the expected relation between the\ndynamical breakdown of the time reversal invariance and the classical limit.\nWe now turn to the discussion of the qualitative features of \u03a0n and \u03a0f in describing the polarizability of the charges\nand the impact of \u03a0i on the classical limit.\nA.\n\nElectric and magnetic susceptibilities\n\nTo make contact with the usual three-dimensional notation we introduce the parametrization A\u03bc = (\u03c6, A) of the\nvector potential, giving rise to E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 \u2212 \u22020 A and B = \u2207 \u00d7 A. We consider quadratic action in the EM field in a\n\n\f17\nformal manner, as a book-keeping device for the equation of motion (51), namely we assume that the actions contain\nthe inverse of the retarded Green function. On the one hand, we can introduce the retarded electric and magnetic\nsusceptibilities \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0303, respectively with the phenomenological parametrization\nZ\n1\nS0 [A] =\n(Ex \u01ebxy Ey \u2212 Bx \u03bc\u0303xy By )\n(80)\n2 x,y\nof the Maxwell action. On the other hand, the effective action for the EM field expectation value yielding the equation\nof motion is\n\u0393=\n\n1\nADr\u22121 A\n2\n\n(81)\n\nwhere Dr\u22121 = D0r\u22121 \u2212 e(G\u0303++ \u2212 G\u0303+\u2212 )e according to Eq. (47). Therefore the equivalence of the two quadratic form,\nexpressed by the equation\n!\n!\n!\n\"\n!\n!#\n1 r\n1\n\u2212n\u03bd\n1 n\u03bd\n0\n0\n1\n\u2212n\u03bd\n0\n0\n2\nr\nq\n\u2212B\n+ [B (1 \u2212 \u03bd 2 ) \u2212 Ar ]\n= q2 \u01eb\n\u2212 (\u03bc\u0303 \u2212 \u01eb)\n,\n2\n\u2212n\u03bd \u03bd 2 11 \u2212 T\nn\u03bd \u03bd 2 L\n0 T\n\u2212n\u03bd \u03bd 2 11 \u2212 T\n0 T\n(82)\nfollows in Fourier space with X r = X ++ \u2212 X +\u2212 . The left hand side contains the free inverse propagator and the\nretarded self energy as given by Eqs. (64) and (66)-(67). The right-hand side is \u03b4 2 S0 [A]/\u03b4A\u2212q \u03b4Aq with \u03bd = \u03c9/|q|,\nn = q/|q|, L = n \u2297 n, and T = 11 \u2212 L. We insert into the right-hand side the expressions \u01eb = 1 + \u03c7 and \u03bc\u0303 = 1 + \u03c7\u0303\nwhich gives, after canceling the free inverse propagator on the left-hand side by the contributions of the one on the\nright-hand side\nBqr\n,\nq2\nBqr (1 \u2212 3\u03bd 2 ) \u2212 Arq\n.\n=\n2q 2\n\n\u03c7q = \u2212\n\u03c7\u0303q\n\n(83)\n\nLet us now see the more detailed, numerical features of the polarization functions at finite density, obtained by\nusing Eqs. (71), (74)-(75) to compute Xqr = Xq++ \u2212 Xq+\u2212 in Eqs. (83). The susceptibilities display a divergent\nstructure which is well known for nonrelativistic Coulomb gas. The magnetic sector and the relativistic effects for the\nEM field are retained in this calculation which slightly modifies the picture. The susceptibilities, q 2 \u01eb\u03c9,q and q 2 \u03bc\u0303\u03c9,q\nare shown in Figs. 1 for m = 1 and \u03bc = 0.1. They all take appreciable values for |r| \u2248 1, cf. Eqs. (74)-(75) and\n(70). The quasiparticle conditions R\u01eb\u03c9,q = 0, R\u03bc\u0303\u03c9,q = 0 have solution along the valley of the line r = 1, shown\non the (|q|, \u03c9) plane in Fig. 2. The approximately linear parts in the electric and magnetic sectors belong to the\nzero sound, the back turning sections correspond to the plasmonlike excitations. The EM field may have relativistic\nenergy and momenta and the relativistic correction factors O(q 2 /2m2 ) in Eqs. (74) modify the plasmon lines in an\nessential manner. They prevent the plasmons from becoming long range and push the frequency up sharply as the\nwave vector tends to zero in the electric sector, as seen in Fig. 2 (a). For \u03c9 \u2265 2 we naturally run into the pair\ncreation singularities. The normal modes of the magnetic sector behave in a rather peculiar manner, the plasmon\nline, shown in Fig. 2 (c) follows approximately a nonrelativistic dispersion relation curve of mass mef f = 10\u22123 even\nin the relativistic domain.\nThe screening of the electric sector manifests itself in the nonvanishing value of the product q 2 R\u01eb in the limit q \u2192 0\nand the resulting infrared divergence in |\u01eb| as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The valley in |\u01eb| identifies the strongly coupled\nmodes, they are along the plasmon line of Fig. 2 (a) and on the continuation of the zero-sound line. The zero-sound\nline shown in Fig. 2 (a) is weakly coupled due to the short life-time. The magnetic sector is qualitatively similar, |\u03bc\u0303|\nplotted in Fig. 3 (b) indicates strongly coupled magnetic plasmons and weakly coupled magnetic zero sound modes.\nThe magnetic field is screened as well as shown by the nonvanishing value of q 2 R\u03bc\u0303 in Fig. 1 (c) in the infrared, q \u2192 0\nlimit.\nThe physics is simpler at low temperature and vanishing density due to the gap in the excitation spectrum for\nthe charges. One finds qualitatively similar frequency and wave vector dependence as displayed in the figures above\nexcept that the overall scale is suppressed by exp(\u2212m/T ).\nB.\n\nConsistency and decoherence\n\nThe reduced density matrix, given by Eq. (76) can always be diagonalized and the resulting basis consists of\ncompletely decohered states. But one can gain no more insight into the classical limit by using this basis.

(a): In the electric sector they are the roots of the equations R\u01eb = 0. The zero\nsound and the plasmon modes correspond to the straight line starting at the origin and after the turning point, respectively.\nThe magnetic quasiparticles are at R\u03bc\u0303 = 0, (b) is around the origin and (c) is on a larger part of the (|q|, \u03c9) plane.\n\nare interested in the role of physically motivated states which persist at both side of the quantum-classical transition.\nThese correspond to quasiparticles, defined by the O(A2 ) part of the bare action (78). Therefore, we seek the\ncontribution of the quasiparticles to decoherence in what follows.

(71) and are plotted in Fig. 4. IS[\u00c2] governs\nthe suppression of each plane wave mode along the off-diagonal direction in the reduced density matrix. It is easy\nto see that this functional is semidefinitive because it measures the phase space available for particle-antiparticle or\nparticle-hole excitations which incorporate decoherence. Its value, taken on the quasiparticle line of Fig. 2, yields\nthe inverse life-time. We see that the zero-sound quasiparticles are rendered unimportant by their short life-time.\nNaturally, higher loop contributions to the effective action generate imaginary part and finite life-time beyond the\nzero-sound line by the multi particle-antiparticle or particle-hole excitations, but this remains a weak effect.\nWhen considered from the point of view of the quantum-classical transition, the effective bare action monitors the\nimpact of the entanglement between the EM field and the charges. One measure of this entanglement is decoherence\nwhich corresponds to an instantaneous state. But we find more information in this action. The suppression of the\ncontributions in the path integral representation of the density matrix as the functional of the difference of the two\nfield trajectories carries information about the consistency of histories of the EM field [3]. The contribution of a plane\nwave, a normal mode of the one-loop dynamics of the EM field, to the conditional probability distributions is closer\nto the one expected in the standard, classical probability if IS[\u00c2] increases with A+ \u2212 A\u2212 because the quantum\ninterference term which violates the additivity of probabilities is suppressed by e\u2212IS [23].\nThe lesson is that the classical probabilities are recovered by plane wave modes whose dispersion relation is that\nof the short life-time quasiparticles. Their short decay time assures the dynamical breakdown of the time reversal\ninvariance, needed for the classical limit. These modes which maximize IS are located around the long wavelength\npart of the zero sound curve at finite density and vanishing temperature. The suppression of the off-diagonal elements\nof the reduced density matrix for these plane wave EM fields shows that these field configurations become good pointer\nstates in the classical limit.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe problem of deriving classical electrodynamics from QED is pursued further in this work. It is based on the\nmonitoring of subclassical fields, and the expectation values of local operators with space-time resolution limited\n\n\f20\n\n3\n0.04\n\n2\n1\n\n0.03\n\n0\n0\n\n0.02\nq\n0.001\n0.002\n\u03a9\n\n0.01\n0.003\n\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n0\n\n0.006\n0.004\nq\n0.0002\n\n0.002\n0.0004\n\u03a9\n0.0006\n0.0008\n\n0.004\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 4: The imaginary part of the bare effective action.

The final goal is to weaken the resolution and thereby recover the macroscopic,\nclassical dynamics for the space-time dependence of the expectation values. As a preparatory step, we make a coarse\ngraining by eliminating the charged degrees of freedom with a fixed, microscopic space-time resolution. Polarization\neffects, arising in this manner, reflect competing coherent and decoherent phenomena, both at the elementary and at\nthe collective level.\nThe double-time axes formalism used in this work was motivated by the implementation of initial conditions, as\nopposed to the boundary value problems within the variational method. This step leads to the double-time axis\nformulation in a natural manner. The double-time axes formalism is well suited to follow the eventual breakdown\nof time reversal invariance at the quantum level, driven dynamically by degeneracies or externally, by the boundary\nconditions in time. The breakdown of the time reversal invariance appears at the level of the expectation value of the\nEM field as the radiation field. A simple microscopic way of separating the EM field into near and far components\nemerges as well for they represent pure state self-interactions for the charges and generate entanglement between\ncharges and the EM field, respectively.\nSome well-known issues appear in a new point of view, such as the origin of the dynamics for the free-field components\nin the variational equations. The free-field component belongs to the null space of the kernel of the free action and drops\nout from the linearized equation of motion. This problem is avoided in the double-time formalism, and Feynman's i\u01eb\nprescription seems to be the analogous treatment in the single time formalisms of both quantum and classical field\ntheory.\nAnother question which can easily be addressed is the relation between the classical limit and the dynamical\nbreakdown of the time reversal invariance. The block structure of the CTP propagators shows that a shorter lifetime\nof the quasiparticles means more consistent EM field trajectories and a narrower peak in the absolute magnitude of\nthe reduced density matrix |\u03c1(x, y)| around the diagonal, x = y. Another way to see this relation by means of the EM\nfield expectation value is to note that the purely imaginary far field component of the CTP polarization tensor, \u03a0f\u03c9,q ,\nplays a double role in the dynamics. On the one hand, it characterizes the mixed states arising from the charge-EM\nfield entanglement, and on the other hand, it leads to a phase delay in the propagation of the EM field and thereby\nbreaks the time reversal invariance.\nThese results open the way for further developments, and we close by mentioning some of them. The subclassical\nfields are expectation values but they are not necessarily classical quantities because they may display the microscopic\nstructure in space-time where decoherence is not efficient. In order to identify initial conditions which lead to classical\nfields, we need to control either the decoherence itself or the characteristic scale of the field expectation value. The\nlatter is determined by the two-point functions and its handling requires the extension of the present scheme to\nexternal sources coupled to the bi-local product of the elementary fields. Such an explicit treatment of the correlation\nfunctions would, in addition, allows us to test different collapse scenarios of the wave function.\nAnother extension of the present study is the detailed analysis of the effective action for the EM field and the\nelectric current to derive a variational scheme for magnetohydrodynamics. The more accurate determination of the\nsusceptibilities from first principles may lead to new experimental devices to identify some signatures of the underlying\nmicroscopic quantum theory by precision measurements in classical electrodynamics.\n\n\f21\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank J\u00e1nos Hajdu for several stimulating discussions and Mahmud Merad for his help in the initial phase of\nthis project.\nAppendix A: CTP propagators in the vacuum\n\nThe CTP vacuum propagators for scalar, vector, and spin-half particles are summarized in this Appendix.
