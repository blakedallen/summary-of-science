For example, \u2205, {x}(x \u2208 V ) and V are intervals of\nT , called trivial intervals. A tournament, all the intervals of which\nare trivial, is indecomposable; otherwise, it is decomposable. A critical tournament is an indecomposable tournament T of cardinality\n\u2265 5 such that for any vertex x of T , the tournament T \u2212 x is decomposable. The critical tournaments are of odd cardinality and for all\nn \u2265 2 there are exactly three critical tournaments on 2n + 1 vertices\ndenoted by T2n+1 , U2n+1 and W2n+1 . The tournaments T5 , U5 and\nW5 are the unique indecomposable tournaments on 5 vertices. We\nsay that a tournament T embeds into a tournament T \u2032 when T is\nisomorphic to a subtournament of T \u2032 . A diamond is a tournament\non 4 vertices admitting only one interval of cardinality 3. We prove\nthe following theorem: if a diamond and T5 embed into an indecomposable tournament T , then W5 and U5 embed into T . To conclude,\nwe prove the following: given an indecomposable tournament T , with\n\n1\n\n\f| V (T ) |\u2265 7, T is critical if and only if the indecomposable subtournaments on 7 vertices of T are isomorphic to one and only one of the\ntournaments T7 , U7 and W7 .\n\nKey words: Tournament; Indecomposable; Critical; Embedding.\n\n1\n\nBasic definitions\n\nA tournament T = (V (T ), A(T )) or (V, A) consists of a finite vertex set\nV with an arc set A of ordered pairs of distinct vertices satisfying: for\nx, y \u2208 V , with x 6= y, (x, y) \u2208 A if and only if (y, x) \u2208\n/ A. The cardinality\nof T is that of V (T ) denoted by | V (T ) |. For two distinct vertices x and y\nof a tournament T , x \u2212\u2192 y means that (x, y) \u2208 A(T ). For x \u2208 V (T ) and\nY \u2282 V (T ), x \u2212\u2192 Y (rep. Y \u2212\u2192 x) signifies that for every y \u2208 Y , x \u2212\u2192 y\n(resp. y \u2212\u2192 x). Given a vertex x of a tournament T = (V, A), NT+ (x)\ndenotes the set {y \u2208 V : x \u2212\u2192 y}. The score of x (in T ), denoted by sT (x),\nis the cardinality of NT+ (x). A tournament is regular if all its vertices share\nthe same score. A transitive tournament or total order is a tournament T\nsuch that for x, y, z \u2208 V (T ), if x \u2212\u2192 y and y \u2212\u2192 z, then x \u2212\u2192 z. For\ntwo distinct vertices x and y of a total order T , x < y means that x \u2212\u2192 y.\nWe write T = a0 < * * * < an to mean that T is the total order defined on\nV (T ) = {a0 , . . . , an } by A(T ) = {(ai , aj ) : i < j}.\nThe notions of isomorphism, of subtournament and of embedding are\ndefined in the following manner. First, let T = (V, A) and T \u2032 = (V \u2032 , A\u2032 )\nbe two tournaments. A one-to-one correspondence f from V onto V \u2032 is\nan isomorphism from T onto T \u2032 provided that for x, y \u2208 V , (x, y) \u2208 A if\nand only if (f (x), f (y)) \u2208 A\u2032 . The tournaments T and T \u2032 are then said\nto be isomorphic, which is denoted by T \u2243 T \u2032 . Moreover, an isomorphism\nfrom a tournament T onto itself is called an automorphism of T . The\nautomorphisms of T form a subgroup of the permutation group of V (T ),\ncalled the automorphism group of T . Second, given a tournament T =\n(V, A), with each subset X of V is associated the subtournament T (X) =\n(X, A \u2229 (X \u00d7 X)) of T induced by X. For x \u2208 V , the subtournament\nT (V \u2212 {x}) is denoted by T \u2212 x. For tournaments T and T \u2032 , if T \u2032 is\nisomorphic to a subtournament of T , then we say that T \u2032 embeds into\nT . Otherwise, we say that T omits T \u2032 . The dual of a tournament T =\n(V, A) is the tournament obtained from T by reversing all its arcs. This\ntournament is denoted by T \u22c6 = (V, A\u22c6 ), where A\u22c6 = {(x, y) : (y, x) \u2208 A}.\nA tournament T is then said to be self-dual if T and T \u22c6 are isomorphic.\nThe indecomposability plays an important role in this paper. Given a\ntournament T = (V, A), a subset I of V is an interval ([4], [7], [10]) (or a\nclan [3] or an homogeneous subset [5]) of T provided that for every x \u2208 V \u2212I,\nx \u2192 I or I \u2192 x. This definition generalizes the notion of interval of a total\n2\n\n\forder. Given a tournament T = (V, A), \u2205, V and {x}, where x \u2208 V ,\nare clearly intervals of T , called trivial intervals. A tournament is then\nsaid to be indecomposable ([7], [10]) (or primitive [3]) if all of its intervals\nare trivial, and is said to be decomposable otherwise. For instance, the\n3-cycle C3 = ({0, 1, 2}, {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)}) is indecomposable whereas a\ntotal order of cardinality \u2265 3 is decomposable. Let us mention the following\nrelationship between indecomposability and duality. The tournaments T\nand T \u22c6 have the same intervals and, thus, T is indecomposable if and only\nif T \u22c6 is indecomposable.\n\n2\n\nThe critical tournaments\n\nAn indecomposable tournament T = (V, A) is said to be critical if | V |> 1\nand for all x \u2208 V , T \u2212 x is decomposable. In order to present our main\nresults and to present the characterization of the critical tournaments due to\nJ.H. Schmerl and W.T. Trotter [10], we introduce the tournaments T2n+1 ,\nU2n+1 and W2n+1 defined on 2n + 1 vertices, where n \u2265 2, as follows:\n\u2022 The tournament T2n+1 is the tournament defined on Z/(2n + 1)Z by\nA(T2n+1 ) = {(i, j) : j \u2212 i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}}, so that, T2n+1 ({0, . . . , n}) =\n0 < * * * < n, T2n+1 ({n + 1, . . . , 2n}) = n + 1 < * * * < 2n and for\ni \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}, {i + 1, . . . , n} \u2212\u2192 i + n + 1 \u2212\u2192 {0, . . . , i} (see\nFigure 1).\n\u2022 The tournament U2n+1 is obtained from T2n+1 by reversing the arcs of\nT2n+1 ({n + 1, . . . , 2n}). Therefore, U2n+1 is defined on {0, . . . , 2n} as\n\u22c6\n({n + 1, . . . , 2n}) =\nfollows: U2n+1 ({0, . . . , n}) = 0 < * * * < n, U2n+1\nn + 1 < * * * < 2n and for i \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}, {i + 1, . . . , n} \u2212\u2192\ni + n + 1 \u2212\u2192 {0, . . . , i} (see Figure 2).\n\u2022 The tournament W2n+1 is defined on {0, . . . , 2n} in the following manner: W2n+1 \u2212 2n = 0 < * * * < 2n \u2212 1 and {1, 3, . . . , 2n \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 2n \u2212\u2192\n{0, 2, . . . , 2n \u2212 2} (see Figure 3).\nTheorem 1 ([10]) Up to isomorphism, the critical tournaments of cardinality \u2265 5 are the tournaments T2n+1 , U2n+1 and W2n+1 , where n \u2265 2.\nNotice that the critical tournaments are self-dual.\n\n3\n\n\f\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\nn+1 . . .\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2732 . . . i+n+1 . . .\n\u2732 . . . 2n\n\u2766\n\u25d7\n\u2711 \u2745\n\u2766\n\u2704 \u2745\n\u25a0\u25d7\n\u2702 \u2745\n\u25a0\u25d7\n\u25a0\n\u2711\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2704\n\u2702\n\u2711\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u2745 \u25d7 \u2720\n\u2702\u270c\n\u2745 \u25d7\n\u2745\n\u2704\u270e\n\u2711 \u2720\n\u2730\n\u2711\n\u2732 1 . . . i\n\u2732 i+1 . . . n \u2212 1\n\u2732 n\n0\n\u274d\n\u25d7\n\u274d\n\u2732\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u2732\n\u25d7\nFigure 1: T2n+1 .\n\n3\n\nThe tournaments T5, U5 and W5 in an indecomposable tournament\n\nWe study the indecomposable tournaments according to their indecomposable subtournaments on 5 vertices. A recent result on our topic is a\ncharacterization of the indecomposable tournaments omitting W5 obtained\nby B.J. Latka [8]. In order to recall this characterization, we introduce the\nPaley tournament P7 defined on Z/7Z by A(P7 ) = {(i, j) : j \u2212 i \u2208 {1, 2, 4}}.\nNotice that the tournaments obtained from P7 by deleting one vertex are\nisomorphic and denote P7 \u2212 6 by B6 .\nTheorem 2 ([8]) Given a tournament T of cardinality \u2265 5, T is indecomposable and omits W5 if and only if T is isomorphic to an element of\n{B6 , P7 } \u222a {T2n+1 : n \u2265 2} \u222a {U2n+1 : n \u2265 2}.\nA diamond is a tournament on 4 vertices admitting only one interval of\ncardinality 3. Up to isomorphism, there are exactly two diamonds D4 and\nD4\u22c6 , where D4 is the tournament defined on {0, 1, 2, 3} by D4 ({0, 1, 2}) = C3\nand 3 \u2212\u2192 {0, 1, 2}.\nThe following theorem is the main result.

The family {X(u) : u \u2208 X} \u222a {Ext(X), [X]} constitutes a partition of\nV \u2212 X.\n2. Given u \u2208 X, for all x \u2208 X(u) and for all y \u2208 V \u2212 (X \u222a X(u)), if\nT (X \u222a {x, y}) is decomposable, then {u, x} is an interval of T (X \u222a\n{x, y}).\n5\n\n\f2n P\n\u2710P\n\u271f\u271f\u2711\n\u274d PPP\n\u2738\u2702 \u274f\n\u276a\n\u271f\n\u274d\u274d\nP\n\u2711\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2711\n\u274d\u274d PPP\n\u2702 \u274f\n\u271f\nPP\n\u2711\n\u271f\n\u274f\n\u274d\u274d\n\u2702\nPP\n\u2711\n\u271f\n\u271f\nP\n\u2711\n\u274f\n\u274d\n\u270c\n\u2702\n\u2765\n\u274d\n\u2719\n\u271f\n\u2732 1 . . . 2i\n\u2732 2i+1 . . . 2n \u2212 2\n\u2732 2n \u2212 1\n0\n\u274d\n\u25d7\n\u274d\n\u2732\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u2732\n\u25d7\nFigure 3: W2n+1 .\n3. For every x \u2208 [X] and for every y \u2208 V \u2212 (X \u222a [X]), if T (X \u222a {x, y})\nis decomposable, then X \u222a {y} is an interval of T (X \u222a {x, y}).\n4. Given x, y \u2208 Ext(X), with x 6= y, if T (X \u222a {x, y}) is decomposable,\nthen {x, y} is an interval of T (X \u222a {x, y}).\nThe below result follows from Lemma 1.\nProposition 2 ([3]) Let T = (V, A) be an indecomposable tournament.\nIf X is a subset of V , such that | X |\u2265 3, | V \u2212 X |\u2265 2 and T (X) is\nindecomposable, then there are distinct elements x and y of V \u2212 X such\nthat T (X \u222a {x, y}) is indecomposable.\nCorollary 1 Let T = (V, A) be an indecomposable tournament such that\n| V | is even and | V |\u2265 6. For each x \u2208 V , there is y \u2208 V \u2212 {x} such that\nT \u2212 y is indecomposable.\nPROOF. As T is indecomposable, there is X \u2282 V such that x \u2208 X and\nT (X) \u2243 C3 . Otherwise, NT+ (x) or V \u2212 ({x} \u222a NT+ (x)) would be non trivial\nintervals of T . Since | V | is even, by applying several times Proposition 2\nfrom the indecomposable subtournament T (X), we get a vertex y \u2208 V \u2212 X\nsuch that T \u2212 y is indecomposable.\n\u0003\nThe 3-cycle C3 is indecomposable and embeds into any indecomposable tournament of cardinality \u2265 3 as observed in the preceding proof. It\nfollows, by Proposition 2, that any indecomposable tournament T of cardinality \u2265 5, admits an indecomposable subtournament on 5 vertices. The\n\n6\n\n\findecomposable tournaments on 5 vertices are critical because the four tournaments on 4 vertices are decomposable. So let us mention the following\nfacts.\nRemark 1\n\u2022 The indecomposable tournaments on 5 vertices are, up to isomorphism, the three critical tournaments T5 , U5 and W5 .\n\u2022 There is no indecomposable tournament of cardinality \u2265 5 omitting\neach of the tournaments T5 , U5 and W5 .\nThe tournaments T2n+1 play an important role in the proof of Theorem 3. We recall some of their properties.\nRemark 2\n\u2022 The tournaments T2n+1 are regular: for all i \u2208 {0, . . . , 2n}, sT2n+1 (i) =\nn;\n\u2022 For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, the unique non trivial interval of T2n+1 \u2212 i is {i+n,\ni+n+1};\n\u2022 The automorphism group of T2n+1 is generated by the permutation\n\u03c3 : i 7\u2192 i + 1;\n\u2022 The permutation \u03c0 : i 7\u2192 \u2212i, is an isomorphism from T2n+1 onto its\ndual.\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 3.\nPROOF OF THEOREM 3. Let T = (V, A) be an indecomposable\ntournament into which a diamond and T5 embed. Consider a minimal\nsubset X of V such that T (X) is indecomposable and a diamond and T5\nembed into T (X). Now, let Y be a maximal subset of X such that T (Y ) \u2243\nT2n+1 for some n \u2265 2. We establish that | X |= 6 by using the following\nobservation. Consider a subset Z of X such that T (Z) \u2243 T2n+1 and assume\nthat Ext(Z) \u2229 X 6= \u2205. Let x \u2208 Ext(Z) \u2229 X. We have T (Z \u222a {x}) is\nindecomposable. Furthermore, as | Z \u222a {x} | is even, a diamond embeds\ninto T (Z \u222a {x}) by Proposition 1. Since T5 embeds into T (Z \u222a {x}) as well,\nit follows from the minimality of X that X = Z \u222a {x}. As an immediate\nconsequence, we have: if Z is a subset of X such that T (Z) \u2243 T2n+1 and\n| X \u2212 Z |\u2265 2, then Ext(Z) \u2229 X = \u2205. By Lemma 1, for every x \u2208 X \u2212 Z,\neither x \u2208 [Z] or there is u \u2208 Z such that x \u2208 Z(u).\nFor a contradiction, suppose that Ext(Y ) \u2229 X = \u2205. By Proposition 2,\nthere are x 6= y \u2208 X \u2212Y such that T (Y \u222a{x, y}) is indecomposable. Clearly,\n7\n\n\fif {x, y} \u2286 [Y ], then Y would be a non trivial interval of T (Y \u222a {x, y}). For\ninstance, assume that there is v \u2208 Y such that y \u2208 Y (v). By Lemma 1,\neither there is u \u2208 Y such that x \u2208 Y (u) or x \u2208 [Y ]. In each of both\ninstances, we obtain a contradiction.\nFirst, suppose that there is u \u2208 Y such that x \u2208 Y (u). We have u 6= v,\notherwise {u, x, y} would be a non trivial interval of T (Y \u222a {x, y}). By\nRemark 2, the automorphism group of T2n+1 is generated by \u03c3 : i 7\u2192\ni + 1. Therefore, by interchanging x and y, we can denote the element of\nY by 0, . . . , 2n in such a way that T (Y ) = T2n+1 , u = 0 and 1 \u2264 v \u2264 n.\nSince T (Y \u222a {x, y}) is indecomposable and 0 \u2212\u2192 v, we get y \u2212\u2192 x by\nLemma 1. Consider Z = (Y \u2212 {0}) \u222a {x}. We have T (Z) \u2243 T2n+1 and,\nby the preceding observation, either y \u2208 [Z] or there is w \u2208 Z such that\ny \u2208 Z(w). The first instance is not possible because {v \u2212 2, v \u2212 1} \u2229 Z 6= \u2205\nand {v \u2212 2, v \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 y \u2212\u2192 x. So assume that there is w \u2208 Z such that\ny \u2208 Z(w). As y \u2212\u2192 x \u2212\u2192 v, w 6= v. Moreover, if w = x, then {x, y} is an\ninterval of T (Z \u222a {y}). Since {v, y} is an interval of T ((Z \u222a {y}) \u2212 {x}), we\nwould obtain that {x, y, v} is an interval of T (Z \u222a {y}) so that {x, v} would\nbe an interval of T (Z). Therefore, w \u2208\n/ {v, x} and hence {v, w} is an interval\nof T (Z)\u2212x. As x \u2208 Y (0), it follows from Remark 2 that {v, w} = {n, n+1}\nso that v = n and n \u2212\u2192 y. By considering the automorphism \u03c3 n+1 of T (Y )\ndefined by \u03c3 n+1 (i) = i + n + 1, we obtain that y \u2208 Y (0) and x \u2208 Y (n + 1).\nBy considering T \u22c6 instead of T , we get y \u2208 Y (0) and x \u2208 Y (n) because\nthe permutation \u03c0 : i 7\u2192 \u2212i is an isomorphism from T (Y ) onto T (Y )\u22c6 by\nRemark 2. Lastly, by interchanging x and y in the foregoing, we obtain\nn \u2212\u2192 x in T \u22c6 which means that initially x \u2212\u2192 0 in T . It follows that the\nfunction Y \u222a {x, y} \u2212\u2192 {0, . . . , 2n + 2}, defined by x 7\u2192 2n + 2, y 7\u2192 n + 1,\ni 7\u2192 i for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n and i 7\u2192 i+1 for n+1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, realizes an isomorphism\nfrom T (Y \u222a {x, y}) onto T2n+3 . Consequently, T (Y \u222a {x, y}) \u2243 T2n+3 , with\nY \u222a {x, y} \u2286 X, which contradicts the maximality of Y .\nSecond, suppose that x \u2208 [Y ]. By interchanging T and T \u22c6 , assume that\ny \u2212\u2192 x \u2212\u2192 Y . Consider Z = (Y \u2212 {v}) \u222a {y}. We have T (Z) \u2243 T2n+1\nand, by the previous observation, either x \u2208 [Z] or there is w \u2208 Z such that\nx \u2208 Z(w). The first instance is not possible because y \u2212\u2192 x \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212 {y}.\nSince y \u2212\u2192 x \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212 {y} and hence sT (Z\u222a{x}) (x) = 2n, the second is not\npossible either. Indeed, given w \u2208 Z, if x \u2208 Z(w), then sT (Z\u222a{x}) (x) \u2208\n{n, n + 1} because sT (Z) (w) = n.\nIt follows that Ext(Y ) \u2229 X 6= \u2205. Set T (Y ) = T2n+1 . By the preceding\nobservation, X = Y \u222a {x}, where x \u2208 Ext(Y ) \u2229 X. As | X | is even, it\nfollows from Corollary 1 that there is j \u2208 X \u2212 {x} such that T (X) \u2212 j is indecomposable. By considering the automorphism \u03c3 2n+1\u2212j of T (Y ), we can\nassume that j = 0. For a contradiction, suppose that T (X) \u2212 0 \u2243 T2n+1 .\nWe would have s(T (X)\u22120) (x) = n. Since s(T (Y )\u22120) (i) = n for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\nand s(T (Y )\u22120) (i) = n \u2212 1 for n + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, we would obtain that\n8\n\n\f+\nN(T\n(X)\u22120) (x) = {1, . . . , n} so that {0, x} would be a non trivial interval\nof T (X). Consequently, T (X) \u2212 0 is not isomorphic to T2n+1 . By Proposition 1, a diamond embeds into T (X) \u2212 0. It follows from the minimality\nof T (X) that T (X) \u2212 0 and hence T (Y ) \u2212 0 omit T5 . As T5 embeds into\nT2m+1 \u2212 0 for m \u2265 3, we get n = 2.\nIt remains to verify that U5 and W5 embed into T (X). Since x \u2208\n/ [Y ],\nsT (X) (x) \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}. By interchanging T and T \u22c6 , assume that sT (X) (x) =\n1 or 2. First, assume that there is i \u2208 Z/5Z such that NT+(X) (x) = {i}. By\nconsidering the automorphism j 7\u2192 j \u2212 i of T5 , assume that i = 0. The\nfunction Z/5Z \u2212\u2192 X \u2212 {3}, which fixes 0, 1, 2, 4 and which maps 3 to\nx, is an isomorphism from U5 onto T (X) \u2212 3. Furthermore, the function\nZ/5Z \u2212\u2192 X \u2212 {2}, defined by 0 7\u2192 3, 1 7\u2192 4, 2 7\u2192 x, 3 7\u2192 0 and 4 7\u2192 1,\nis an isomorphism from W5 onto T (X) \u2212 2. Finally, assume that there is\ni \u2208 Z/5Z such that NT+(X) (x) = {i, i + 1} or {i, i + 2}. If NT+(X) (x) =\n{i, i + 1}, then {i \u2212 1, x} would be an interval of T (X). So, by considering\nthe automorphism k 7\u2192 k \u2212 i of T5 , assume that NT+(X) (x) = {0, 2}. The\nfunction Z/5Z \u2212\u2192 X \u2212 {0}, defined by 0 7\u2192 2, 1 7\u2192 3, 2 7\u2192 4, 3 7\u2192 x\nand 4 7\u2192 1, is an isomorphism from U5 onto T (X) \u2212 0. Furthermore, the\nfunction Z/5Z \u2212\u2192 X \u2212 {2}, defined by 0 7\u2192 3, 1 7\u2192 4, 2 7\u2192 x, 3 7\u2192 0 and\n4 7\u2192 1, is an isomorphism from W5 onto T (X) \u2212 2.\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nA new characterization of the critical tournaments\n\nIn this section we discuss some other questions concerning the indecomposable subtournaments on 5 and 7 vertices of an indecomposable tournament.\nIn particular, we obtain a new characterization of the critical tournaments.\nIn that order, we recall the following two results concerning the critical\ntournaments.\nLemma 2 ([10]) The indecomposable subtournaments of T2n+1 on at least\n5 vertices, where n \u2265 2, are isomorphic to T2m+1 , where 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n. The\nsame holds for the indecomposable subtournamants of U2n+1 and of W2n+1 .\nLemma 3 ([2]) Given an indecomposable tournament T of cardinality \u2265\n5, T is critical if and only if T omits any indecomposable tournament on\nsix vertices.\nLet T be an indecomposable tournament of cardinality \u2265 5. We denote\nby I5 (T ) the set of the elements of {T5 , U5 , W5 } embedding in T . By Remark 1, I5 (T ) 6= \u2205. By Theorem 3, I5 (T ) 6= {T5 , U5 } and I5 (T ) 6= {T5 , W5 }.\n9\n\n\fWe characterize the indecomposable tournaments T such that I5 (T ) = {T5 }\n(resp. I5 (T ) = {U5 }). The following remark completes this discussion.\nRemark 3 For J = {W5 }, {U5 , W5 } or {T5 , U5 , W5 } and for n \u2265 6, there\nexists an indecomposable tournament T of cardinality n such that I5 (T ) =\nJ.\nFor n \u2265 5, the tournaments En+1 , Fn+1 and Gn+1 defined below on {0, . . . ,\nn} are indecomposable and satisfy I5 (En+1 ) = {T5 , U5 , W5 }, I5 (Fn+1 ) =\n{W5 } and I5 (Gn+1 ) = {U5 , W5 }.\n\u2022 En+1 ({0, . . . , 4}) = T5 and, for all 5 \u2264 k \u2264 n, NE+n+1 ({0,...,k}) (k) =\n{k \u2212 1};\n\u2022 A(Fn+1 ) = {(i, j) : i + 1 < j or i = j + 1};\n+\n(n) = {0}.\n\u2022 Gn ({0, . . . , n \u2212 1}) = Fn and NG\nn+1\n\nThe following is an easy consequence of Theorem 2 and of Lemma 2.\nCorollary 2 The next two assertions are satisfied by any indecomposable\ntournament T of cardinality \u2265 5.\n1. T is isomorphic to T2n+1 for some n \u2265 2 if and only if the indecomposable subtournaments of T on 5 vertices are isomorphic to T5 .\n2. T is isomorphic to B6 , P7 or to U2n+1 for some n \u2265 2 if and only if\nthe indecomposable subtournaments of T on 5 vertices are isomorphic\nto U5 .\nFor all n \u2265 6, the tournament Fn defined in Remark 3 is an indecomposable non critical tournament all the indecomposable subtournaments of\nwhich are isomorphic to W5 . This leads us to the following characterization\nof the tournaments W2n+1 and to the problem below.\nProposition 3 Given an indecomposable tournament T of cardinality \u2265 7,\nT is isomorphic to W2n+1 for some n \u2265 3 if and only if the indecomposable\nsubtournaments on 7 vertices of T are isomorphic to W7 .\nPROOF. By Lemma 2, if T \u2243 W2n+1 , where n \u2265 3, then the indecomposable subtournaments of T on 7 vertices are isomorphic to W7 . Conversely,\nassume that the indecomposable subtournaments of T on 7 vertices are isomorphic to W7 . By Lemma 2, it suffices to show that T is critical. Clearly,\nif | V (T ) |= 7, then T \u2243 W7 . So assume that | V (T ) |\u2265 8. For a contradiction, suppose that T is not critical. It follows from Lemma 3 that\nthere exists X \u2282 V (T ) such that | X |= 6 and T (X) is indecomposable. By\nProposition 2, there is Y \u2286 V (T ) such that X \u2282 Y , | Y |= 8 and T (Y )\n10\n\n\fis indecomposable. As | Y | is even, T (Y ) is not critical. Consider x \u2208 Y\nsuch that T (Y ) \u2212 x is indecomposable. We have T (Y ) \u2212 x \u2243 W7 and hence\nwe can denote the elements of Y by 0, . . . , 7 in such a way that x = 7 and\nT (Y ) \u2212 7 = W7 . By Corollary 1, there is y \u2208 {0, . . . , 6} such that T (Y ) \u2212 y\nis indecomposable and thus T (Y ) \u2212 y \u2243 W7 . To obtain a contradiction, we\nverify that {y, 7} would be a non trivial interval of T (Y ). By interchanging\nT and T \u22c6 , we can assume that y \u2208 {0, 1, 2} \u222a {6} because the permutation\nof Z/7Z, which fixes 6 and which exchanges i and 5 \u2212 i for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 5, is\nan isomorphism from W7 onto its dual. First, assume that y = 6. We have\nT (Y ) \u2212 {6, 7} = 0 < * * * < 5. Since {1, . . . , 5} \u222a {7} is not an interval of\nT (Y )\u22126, 7 \u2212\u2192 0. As {i, i+1} is not an interval of T (Y )\u22126 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 4, we\nobtain successively that 1 \u2212\u2192 7, 7 \u2212\u2192 2, 3 \u2212\u2192 7, 7 \u2212\u2192 4 and 5 \u2212\u2192 7. Second, assume that y \u2208 {0, 1, 2}. For z \u2208 {0, . . . , 7} \u2212 {y, 6}, C3 embeds into\nT (Y )\u2212{y, z} because T ({2i, 2i+1, 6}) \u2243 C3 for i \u2208 {0, 1, 2}. It follows that\nthe isomorphism from W7 onto T (Y )\u2212y fixes 6. Consequently, T (Y )\u2212{y, 6}\nis transitive. We have only to check that T (Y ) \u2212 {y, 6} is obtained from\nthe usual total order on {0, . . . , 5} by replacing y by 7. If y = 0, then\n7 \u2212\u2192 1 because 1 \u2212\u2192 {2, . . . , 6}. Thus T (Y ) \u2212 {y, 6} = 7 < 1 < * * * < 5.\nIf y = 1 or 2, then {y \u2212 1, y + 1} is an interval of T (Y ) \u2212 {y, 7}. Therefore, {y \u2212 1, y + 1} is not an interval of T ({y \u2212 1, y + 1, 7}) and hence\nT (Y ) \u2212 {y, 6} = * * * < y \u2212 1 < 7 < y + 1 < * * * < 5.\n\u0003\nFrom Corollary 2 and Proposition 3, we obtain the following recognition\nof the critical tournaments from their indecomposable subtournaments on\n7 vertices.\nCorollary 3 Given an indecomposable tournament T , with | V (T ) |\u2265 7, T\nis critical if and only if the indecomposable subtournaments on 7 vertices of\nT are isomorphic to one and only one of the tournaments T7 , U7 and W7 .\nProblem 1 Characterize the indecomposable tournaments all of whose indecomposable subtournaments on 5 vertices are isomorphic to W5 .\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
