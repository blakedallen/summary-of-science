[1]\nfor a review). The presence of these SMBHs presents a puzzle. Metal\u2013free stars, with\nmasses \u223c 100 M\u2299 , are expected to form at redshifts as high as z >\n\u223c 25 [2, 3, 4], and\nleave behind remnant BHs with similar masses [5]. However, the natural time-scale, i.e.\nthe Eddington time, for growing these seed BHs by >\n\u223c 7 orders of magnitude in mass\nis comparable to the age of the universe (e.g. ref.[6]). This makes it difficult to reach\n109 M\u2299 without a phase of rapid (at least modestly super\u2013Eddington) accretion, unless a\nlist of optimistic assumptions are made in hierarchical merger models, in which multiple\nseed BHs are allowed to grow without interruption, and to combine into a single SMBH\n[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nAn alternative class of explanations involves yet more rapid gas accretion or collapse\n[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In this family of models, primordial gas\ncollapses rapidly into a SMBH as massive as 104 \u2212 106 M\u2299, either directly, or possibly\nby accreting onto a pre\u2013existing smaller seed BH [27], or going through the intermediate\nstate of a very massive star [17], a dense stellar cluster [28, 29], or a \"quasistar\" [30].\nThese so\u2013called \"direct collapse\" models involve metal\u2013free gas in relatively massive\n8\n4\n(>\n\u223c 10 M\u2299) dark matter halos at redshift z >\n\u223c 10 K.\n\u223c 10, with virial temperatures Tvir >\nThe gas that cools and collapses in these halos must avoid fragmentation, shed angular\nmomentum efficiently, and collapse rapidly.\n\n\fGROWTH FROM STELLAR-MASS SEEDS\nSeveral authors have worked out the growth of SMBHs from stellar\u2013mass seeds, by\nfollowing the build-up of dark matter (DM) halos, and using simple prescriptions to track\nthe formation of seed BHs, their subsequent growth by accretion, and their mergers. This\ncan be done either semi\u2013analytically [6, 31, 7, 10], using Monte-Carlo realizations of the\nDM merger trees [8, 9, 11, 15], or based on cosmological hydrodynamics simulations\n[13, 12, 14].\nThe uncertainties about the statistics of the DM halo merger trees are essentially\nnegligible, since DM halo formation has been directly resolved in numerical simulations\nat the relevant low masses (down to \u223c 106 M\u2299) and high redshifts (out to z \u2248 30).\nThe accuracy of the merger trees is limited mainly by the 5 \u2212 10% uncertainty in the\nnormalization of the primordial power spectrum, \u03c38h\u22121 , and by the need to extrapolate\nthe primordial power spectrum 2-3 orders of magnitude below the spatial scales on\nwhich it has been directly constrained.1\nThe most important \u2013 and still rather uncertain \u2013 ingredients of this 'stellar seed'\nscenario can be summarized as follows. (i) What is the threshold mass (or virial temperature, Tseed ) for early DM halos in which Pop III stars can form? A reasonable guess is\nTseed = few \u00d7 100 K, which allows molecular H2 \u2013cooling [33, 34]. (ii) In what fraction\n( fseed ) of these halos do seed BHs form? This is a more difficult question, since various\nfeedback processes (due to radiation, metal pollution, or mechanical energy deposition)\ncould suppress Pop III star formation in the vast majority of early low\u2013mass halos. The\nanswer also depends on the IMF of Pop III stars, since whether the stars leave a BH\nremnant or explode as pair-instability SNe depends on their masses. (iii) What is the\ntime\u2013averaged accretion rate of the seed BHs? This is conveniently parameterized by a\nduty cycle fduty , defined as the fraction of the mass accretion rate that would produce the\nEddington luminosity, if \u03b5 \u2248 10% of the rest mass was converted to radiation (so that\nfduty = 1 is the fiducial Eddington rate). The expectation is that fduty is less than unity\ndue to radiative feedback (but in practice, if the accretion is radiatively inefficient, or\nif the radiation is trapped or is beamed and \"leaks out\", then fduty could exceed unity).\n(iv) Finally, what happens when DM halos merge? The simplest and most optimistic\nassumption is that the BHs to promptly coalesce, as well. However, even if dynamical\nfriction on the DM is efficient, it is possible that, due to the radiation of its parent star,\nthe remnant BHs are no longer embedded in dense enough gas to allow this. Furthermore, even if the BHs coalesce, the merged binary BH can be ejected from the shallow\npotential wells (\u223c 1km/s) of the early halos by the gravitational \"kick\", and effectively\nlost. This depends on the recoil speed, which depends strongly on the mass ratio and on\nthe spin vectors of the two BHs.\nIn Figure 1, we show SMBH mass functions at z = 6, illustrating the impact of\nthe above assumptions, taken from a recent example of the Monte Carlo merger tree\napproach [15]. The mass functions were constructed from the merger histories of \u2248 105\n1\n\nIn models in which the small-scale power is suppressed, such as warm dark matter, this extrapolation\ncan dramatically reduce the number of high-redshift halos, making it much harder to form the seeds of the\nz = 6 SMBHs [32].\n\n\fFIGURE 1. The comoving number densities of SMBHs in different mass bins at redshift z = 6.\nThe 24 different models shown in the figure assume different parameter combinations as follows. The\ncolumns, from left to right, adopt fseed = 10\u22123 , 10\u22122 , 10\u22121 , 1. The top row assumes a random binary\nspin orientation, and the bottom row assumes that BH spins are aligned with the binary's orbital angular\nmomentum. In each panel, the time\u2013averaged mass\u2013accretion rates, in Eddington units, are assumed to be\neither fduty = 1 (black solid curves), fduty = 0.8 (blue dotted), and fduty = 0.6 (green dash-dotted). The\nnumbers in the upper-right corners represent the total mass density in SMBHs log10 [\u03c1\u2022 /(M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 )] for\n9.6\neach model. The red dashed line demarcates the abundance of z \u2248 6 SMBHs with m >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 already\nobserved in the SDSS.\n\nDM halos with masses M > 108 M\u2299 at redshift z = 6. A robust conclusion for a model\nto produce enough z = 6 SMBHs is that fduty >\n\u223c 0.6 \u2013 namely the \u2248 100 M\u2299 stellar\nseed BHs must accrete near the Eddington rate nearly all the time. The initial BH\n\u22123\noccupation fraction also has to be fseed >\n\u223c 10 . Finally, if the initial seeds are rare\n( fseed = 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 ), then gravitational kicks do not have a big impact, and it makes\nlittle difference to the SMBH mass function whether spins are aligned or randomly\noriented. This is because in this case, the few \"lucky\" seeds that form earliest already\nhave a chance to grow by >\n\u223c two orders of magnitude in mass before encountering\ntheir first merger. The masses of the two BHs at the merger are then very unequal\n(q = M1 /M2 <\n\u223c 0.01), making kick velocities too low (\u223c 1km/s; irrespective of the spins)\nto lead to ejection.\nAn important additional issue is that in those models that satisfy the SDSS constraint\non the SMBH abundance (upper right corners in Figure 1, marked in red), the massive\nend of the SMBH mass function is extremely steep. This prediction is not surprising,\nas the most massive SMBHs reside in few \u00d71012 M\u2299 halos, which probe the 5\u03c3 tail of\nthe halo mass function at z = 6 (and there are indeed \u2248 108 times as many few\u00d7109 M\u2299\nhalos, which host \u223c 106 M\u2299 BHs). It does mean, however, that the total mass density in\n5\nSMBHs with masses above >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 BHs (shown by the numbers in the upper right\ncorners in Figure 1) are overpredicted by a factor of 102 \u2212 103 . The mass density of such\nSMBHs at z \u2248 0 is inferred to be several\u00d7105M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 , and the expectation is that\nmost (>\n\u223c 90%) of this mass was accreted well after z = 6 [35]. Some strong feedback is\n\n\fFIGURE 2. Temperature evolution of a metal-free cloud, irradiated by a strong UV flux. The models\nsolve for the chemical and thermal evolution, but assume a pre\u2013imposed density evolution, based on\nthe spherical collapse model. Various cases are shown, with UV intensities at the Lyman limit of J21 =\n0, 1, 10, 100 and 103 , in the usual units of 10\u221221 erg cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 (solid and dashed curves; see\nthe legend in the panel). Each blue dotted line corresponds to a different constant Jeans mass. The gas is\nheated adiabatically until a density of n \u2248 100 \u2212 102 cm\u22123 , at which H2 \u2013cooling becomes efficient and\ncools the gas to a few \u00d7100 K. However, there exists a critical flux, with a value between J21 = 102 and\n103, above which H2 \u2013cooling is disabled (adapted from ref.[28]).\n\ntherefore needed to eliminate this significant overprediction. Possible candidates for this\nare radiative feedback internal to halos, which maintains the \"M \u2212 \u03c3 relation\" in ultra\u2013\nhigh redshift, low mass halos, or the termination of Pop III star formation, at redshifts\nas high as z \u223c 20, due to Lyman Werner radiation or metal pollution.\nFinally, it is worth emphasizing that the mass accretion rate corresponding to the\nEddington limit \u2013 for the fiducial radiative efficiency of \u03b5 \u2261 L/\u1e41c2 = 0.1 for converting\nmass to radiation \u2013 would need to be exceeded only by a factor of a \u223c few to make the\ngrowth from stellar seeds much easier. Radiative feedback is usually expected to lead to\nsub\u2013Eddington rates (e.g. [36]), and in spherical symmetry, the accretion was recently to\nshown to be episodic, with fduty \u2248 0.3 [37]. However, modestly exceeding the Eddington\nrate is certainly plausible in theory: density inhomogeneities can allow radiation to\nleak out of low density regions while most of the accreting matter can be contained\nin high density regions. For example, magnetized radiation dominated accretion disks\nare subject to a \"photon bubble\" instability that nonlinearly appears to lead to strong\ndensity inhomogeneities (e.g. [38]). Nevertheless, observations have so far not revealed\nsystems that sustain super\u2013Eddington accretion for extended periods; it would then still\nhave to be explained why the z \u2248 6 quasar BHs have this unique behaviour.\n\n\fGROWTH BY RAPID DIRECT COLLAPSE\nAn appealing alternative idea is to produce, say, a 105 M\u2299 SMBH \"directly\" \u2013 i.e. much\nfaster than this would take under Eddington\u2013limited accretion from a stellar seed. This\nwould clearly be helpful to explain the high\u2013redshift SMBHs, and many authors (listed\nin the Introduction) proposed this may be possible using metal\u2013free gas in relatively\n8\nmassive (>\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 ) dark matter halos at redshift z >\n\u223c 10, with virial temperatures\n4\nTvir >\n\u223c 10 K.\nThe gas that cools and collapses in these halos must avoid fragmentation, shed angular\nmomentum efficiently, and collapse rapidly. These conditions are unlikely to be met,\nunless the gas remains \"warm\", i.e. at temperatures Tvir \u223c 104 K. In recent numerical\nsimulations, Shang et al. [26] found that the gas in such halos, when collapsing in\nisolation, forms H2 efficiently, and cools to temperatures of T \u223c 300 K. Although no\nfragmentation was seen, the gas is expected to ultimately fragment on smaller scales that\nhave not yet been resolved [39]. More importantly, even if fragmentation was avoided,\nthe cold gas was found to flow inward at low velocities, near the sound speed of \u223c\n2 \u2212 3 km s\u22121 , with a correspondingly low accretion rate of \u223c 0.01 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This results\nin conditions nearly identical to those in the cores of lower-mass minihalos; extensive\nultra\u2013high resolution simulations had concluded that the gas then forms a single \u223c\n100 M\u2299 star [2, 3, 4] or perhaps a massive binary [39], rather than a supermassive star\nor BH.\nThere have been at least three different ideas on how to avoid H2 \u2013cooling and keep\nthe gas warm. One is for the gas to \"linger\" for a sufficiently long time at 104 K that\nit collapses to a SMBH, even before H2 has a chance to reduce the temperature. For\na sufficiently high space\u2013 and column\u2013density of neutral hydrogen, the absorption of\ntrapped Lyman \u03b1 photons can be followed by collisional de\u2013excitation, rather than the\nresonant scattering of the Lyman \u03b1 photon, effectively trapping much of the cooling\nradiation. This could lead to such lingering and to SMBH formation \u2013 analogous to\nopacity\u2013limited fragmentation in colder gas in the context of star formation [20, 25].\nAlternatively, H2 \u2013cooling may be disabled if the gas is exposed to an intense UV\nflux J, either directly photo\u2013dissociating H2 (in the Lyman\u2013Werner bands near a photon\nenergy of \u223c 12 eV) or photo\u2013dissociating the intermediary H\u2212 (at photon energies\n\u22121\n>\n\u223c 0.76 eV). Requiring the photo-dissociation timescale, tdiss \u221d J , to be shorter than\n\u22121\nthe H2 \u2013formation timescale, tform \u221d \u03c1 , generically yields a critical flux that increases\n4\nlinearly with density, J crit \u221d \u03c1 . Since the gas in halos with Tvir >\n\u223c 10 K can cool via\natomic Lyman \u03b1 radiation and lose pressure support, it inevitably collapses further. As a\nresult, in these halos, the critical flux is high, J crit \u2248 102 \u2212105 , depending on the assumed\nspectral shape (ref. [26]; see also refs. [40, 17] who found similar, but somewhat higher\nvalues). The existence of this critical flux is illustrated in Figure 2, using a one-zone\nmodel in which the density evolution is approximated by spherical collapse. Figure 3\nshows the radial structure of a 108 M\u2299 halo, at the time of its collapse, when illuminated\nat various intensities, taken from three\u2013dimensional simulations with the AMR code\nEnzo. These profiles clearly show that when the UV flux exceeds a critical value, the\ncore of the halo is prevented from cooling to low temperatures.\nThe 3D simulations also provide an estimate of the mass of the central \"object\"\n\n\f1010\n\n106\n104\n\nT (K)\n\nn(cm-3)\n\n104\n\nJ21=1 \u00d7 100\nJ21=1 \u00d7 1011\nJ21=3 \u00d7 10\nJ21=1 \u00d7 1023\nJ21=1 \u00d7 10\n\n108\n\n102\n\n103\n\n100\n10-2\n10-4\n10-3 10-2 10-1\n\n100 101\nR (pc)\n\n102\n\n103\n\n102\n10-3\n\n104\n\n10-2\n\n100 101\nR (pc)\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n103\n\n104\n\n10-3\n10-4\n\n10-4\n\n10-5\n2\n\n10-5\n\nfH\n\nfe\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-6\n10-7\n\n10-6\n10\n\n10-2\n\n10-8\n\n-7\n\n10-9\n\n10-8\n10-3 10-2 10-1\n\n100 101\nR (pc)\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n10-10\n10-3 10-2 10-1\n\n100 101\nR (pc)\n\n102\n\nFIGURE 3. The results of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations of a primordial halo, with a\ntotal mass of a few \u00d7107 M\u2299 , collapsing at redshift z \u2248 10 \u2212 15, exposed to various UV background\nfluxes. The four panels show snapshots of the spherically averaged profile of the particle number density,\ngas temperature, e\u2212 fraction and H2 fraction at the time of the collapse of the core for several different\nvalues of the UV background intensity J21 , as labeled. The existence of a critical flux, here with a value\nbetween J21 = 30 and 102 , above which H2 \u2013cooling is disabled, is evident (adapted from ref.[26]).\n\n(star or SMBH) that ultimately forms at the core of the halo, based on the measured\nprofile of the mass accretion rate. This is illustrated in Figure 4. In particular, when the\nflux exceeds the critical value, and the gas remains warm, the collapse is significantly\ndelayed. However, when the gas ultimately does collapse, it accretes toward the center\nat the sound speed (cs \u2248 10km/s), leading to a mass accretion rate of \u1e40 \u2248 1M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nThis is much higher than in the case of cold (cs \u223c 1 km/s) gas in halos with efficient H2\ncooling (the simulations reveal \u1e40 \u221d c3s , as expected in self\u2013gravitating gas).\nImportantly, the critical flux is high \u2013 likely significantly exceeding the expected\nlevel of the cosmic UV background at high redshifts. Therefore, only a small subset\n4\nof all Tvir >\n\u223c 10 K halos, which have unusually close and bright neighbors, may see\na sufficiently high flux. However, given the strong clustering of early halos, there is\na sufficient number of these close halo pairs to account for the abundance of the z =\n6 quasars [41]. A more significant challenge to this idea is that in order to avoid\nfragmentation, the gas in these halos must also remain essentially free of any metals\nand dust [28]. This requirement could be difficult to reconcile with the presence of a\nnearby, luminous galaxies.\n\nALTERNATIVE MODELS\nSince both of the \"standard\" scenarios discussed above require some optimistic assumptions, it is interesting to consider some more exotic possibilities.\nIt is commonly believed that the magnetic fields permeating galaxies such as the\nMilky Way arose by the amplification of a much weaker large\u2013scale seed field.

The local accretion timescale tacc as a function of the enclosed gas mass Mgas , in the same\nhalo depicted in Figure 3, illuminated with different intensities, as labeled. In the halos exposed to a\nsupercritical flux (J21 = 102 and 103 ), the mass accretion rate, \u1e40 \u2248 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , is nearly 103 times higher\n5\nthan in halos whose gas cools via H2 (J21 <\n\u223c 10). At the center of the brightly illuminated halos, \u223c 10 M\u2299\n5\nof gas accumulates within a Kelvin-Helmholtz time of \u223c 10 yr, possibly leading to the formation of a\nSMBH with a comparable mass (adapted from ref.[26]).\n\nprimordial magnetic fields, with strengths of up to \u223c 1nG, can be produced in phase\ntransitions in the early universe, during inflation, or during the electroweak or QCD\nphase transitions. It has recently been shown that such a primordial magnetic field could\nproduce a variant of the \"direct collapse\" scenario [42]. In particular, if the field is\ntangled, then ambipolar diffusion will provide an efficient new mechanism to heat the\ngas as it collapses in protogalactic halos. If the field has a strength above | B |>\n\u223c 3.6\n4\n(comoving) nG, the collapsing gas is kept warm (T \u223c 10 K) until it reaches the\ncritical density ncrit \u2248 103 cm\u22123 at which the roto\u2013vibrational states of H2 approach\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium. H2 \u2013cooling then remains inefficient, and the gas\ntemperature stays near \u223c 104 K, even as it continues to collapse to higher densities.\nThe critical magnetic field strength required to permanently suppress H2 \u2013cooling is\nsomewhat higher than upper limit of \u223c 2nG from the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB). However, it can be realized in the rare >\n\u223c (2 \u2212 3)\u03c3 regions of the spatially\nfluctuating B\u2013field; these regions contain a sufficient number of halos to account for\nthe z \u2248 6 quasar BHs 2\nAnother \"exotic\" idea is that the first Pop III stars may be powered by heating by\ndark matter annihilation, rather than by nuclear fusion [43]. Weakly interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs) can be such a heat source, as long as they reach sufficiently high\ndensity inside the first stars, and if the annihilation products are trapped inside the star.\n2\n\nBecause of the high magnetic Jeans mass, the magnetic pressure has significant dynamical effects, and\n10\ncan prevent gas collapse in halos with masses up to M >\n\u223c few \u00d7 10 M\u2299 . These are \u223c100 times more\nmassive than the DM halos in the \"usual\" direct collapse models.\n\n\fFIGURE 5. The temperature evolution of a patch of the intergalactic medium is shown as it initially\nexpands and then turns around and collapses to high density. The different curves correspond to different\nvalues of the assumed primordial magnetic field, as labeled. The gas evolves from the left to the right\non this figure. The left panel shows the expanding phase, starting from an initial density of \u2248 100 cm\u22123\n(corresponding to the mean density at redshift z \u2243 800) and ending at the turnaround just below n =\n10\u22122 cm\u22123 . The right panel follows the subsequent temperature evolution in the collapsing phase. The\nfigure shows the existence of a critical magnetic field, with a value between B = 3 and 4 nG, above which\nH2 \u2013cooling is disabled, and the gas temperature always remains near 104 K (adapted from ref.[42]).\n\nSeveral authors have studied the impact of this additional heating mechanism on the\nstructure and evolution of such \"dark stars\" [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 44, 49, 50]. In particular,\nthese stars can live much longer than \"normal\" Pop III stars, and because their radiation\nis soft, they can continue to accrete gas, as long as the dark matter heating persists,\nand grow to masses of up to \u223c 105 M\u2299 [48, 49]. These stars are bright, and should be\ndetectable directly by JWST [49].\n\nOBSERVATIONAL PROSPECTS\nIn order to distinguish between the various proposed models discussed above, observations must be able to detect SMBHs with masses below 106 M\u2299 beyond redshift z \u2248 10.\nThis requirement is satisfied by JWST (with a sensitivity of \u223c 10 nJy at near-IR wavelengths) and also in the radio by EVLA and, ultimately, the proposed instrument SKA\n(with sensitivities of 1-10 \u03bc Jy at 1-10 GHz). These IR and radio data should also be\nable to provide at least a crude measure of their masses, but obtaining redshifts will be\nchallenging.\nThe assembly of the earliest SMBHs will ultimately be best probed by the LISA\nsatellite, which could detect M < 104 M\u2299 black holes beyond redshift z \u223c 20, with\na signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio of S/N > 30 or better [51]. This should allow at least a crude\ndetermination of the masses and distances to these low\u2013mass SMBHs, and to directly\ndistinguish between the various proposed scenarios .\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank the organizers for their kind invitation and for putting together a very stimulating\nconference.
