In a topological insulator (TI) the bulk state has a band gap but the\ntopological surface state (TSS) is gapless due to the protection by the time reversal\nsymmetry (TRS). In three-dimensional (3D) TIs, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 [1], the bulk\nband gap is nontrivial, and the TSS is robust with a single Dirac cone at \u0393 point [2-4]\nthat originates from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [5]. The TRS of a TI can be broken by\nintroducing magnetic atoms on its surface [6-12], leading to a band gap opening at the\nDirac point so that TIs with their surface doped with magnetic atoms can provide useful\nspintronics applications [6,11]. The interactions between magnetic adatoms on a TI\nsurface are known to follow a RKKY behavior [8,9,11]. In describing these interactions\nusing a model k \u2219 p Hamiltonian, both the anisotropic (Heisenberg-Ising) spin exchange\nand the antisymmetric (i.e., DM) exchange are taken into consideration [11]. As for the\npreferred spin-orientation [i.e., the single-ion anisotropy (SIA)] of magnetic adatoms,\nwhich opens a gap at the Dirac point when their spins are parallel to the c-axis [3], there\nexists controversy [3,7]. In accounting for the magnetism mediated by the TSS, therefore,\nit is necessary to investigate it on the basis of first-principles methods without neglecting\nthe SIA.\nIn this Letter, we investigate the nature of the magnetism arising from magnetic\nadatoms on a TI surface by performing density functional calculations for Bi2Se3 with\nmagnetic Fe atoms adsorbed on its (111) surface and by analyzing results of the\ncalculations in terms of the energy-mapping method [13]. We show that, in the dilute\nadsorption limit, a Fe adatom exhibits a strong easy-axis SIA due to the spin polarized Bi\nand Se atoms surrounding it, the spin exchange J between the magnetic adatoms is\n\n\fstrongly anisotropic and follows a RKKY-like behavior, and the DM interaction between\nthem is strong with |D/J| \uf0bb 0.3 due to the mediation by the TSS and can be enhanced\nfurther by external electric field, indicating potential applications of TIs with magnetic\nadatoms on their surface to spintronics.\nCalculations and structures. Our density functional calculations were performed\nusing the Vienna ab initio simulation package [14] with the projector-augmented-wave\nmethod [15,16], the generalized gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof\n[17] for exchange-correlation functional, and a plane-wave cut-off energy of 340 eV.\nExperimentally, Bi2Se3 with a few quintuple layers (QLs) or even only one QL were\nprepared to study the TSS [2,18]. In this Letter, we simulate the (111) surface of Bi2Se3\nby using a slab of one quintuple layer (1QL-slab) of Bi2Se3 with the vacuum layer more\nthan 10 \u00c5. The structure of 1QL-slab with Fe atoms adsorbed on one surface was fully\nrelaxed using one k-point (i.e., \uf047). With the resulting optimized structure, 4\uf0b44\uf0b41\nsupercell calculations were carried out using a set of 3\uf0b43\uf0b41 k-points for one Fe\nadsorption per supercell as well as for cases of two Fe adatoms per supercell when the\ndistance R between them is short. However, 8\uf0b44\uf0b41 supercell calculations were performed\nusing a set of 2\uf0b43\uf0b41 k-points for cases of two Fe adatoms per supercell if their distance R\nis large (see below). The use of the large supercells is necessary to simulate the dilute\nadsorption limit. All calculations were performed including SOC on all atoms unless\notherwise stated. In our calculations the effect of an external electric field along the\nc-direction was included by using the planar dipole layer method [19]. We also simulated\nthe Fe-adsorbed (111) surface of Bi2Se3 by using a slab of two QLs (2QL-slab) and that\n\n\fof four QLs (4QL-slab), to find that the use of the 1QL-slab model for the (111) surface\nof Bi2Se3 is sufficient for discussing the problems under consideration [20].\nThe top views of the 4\uf0b44 and 8\uf0b44 supercells of the pristine (111) surface of Bi2Se3\nare presented in Fig. 1(a). Each QL has the layer sequence Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se. We\nconsidered two possible adsorption sites on the (111) surface of Bi2Se3 [A and B in Fig.\n1(a)]. The A sites are the hollow sites of the nearest-neighbor Se3 triangles on the surface\nSe layer, while the B sites are the on-top sites of the Bi atoms. Our calculations show that\neach Fe prefers the B-site adsorption to the A-site adsorption by 75.8 meV. Thus,\nhereafter, we will assume the B-site adsorption of Fe atoms unless otherwise stated. We\ndenote the Bi and Se atoms adjacent to the Fe adatom at B site as Bi* and Se*,\nrespectively. The Fe atom lies slightly (0.268 \u00c5) above the center of the Se*3 triangle,\nand the Bi* atom goes down by 0.753 \u00c5 from the position of the pristine 1QL-slab [Fig.\n1(b)]. Without loss of generality, we take the local z-axis along the c-axis, and set the\npositive x-axis for a Fe atom pair along the dimer (i.e., R = r2 \u2212 r1 ).\nElectronic structure. The band structure calculated for the pristine 1QL-slab [Fig.\n2(a)] shows a band gap of 0.5 eV in agreement with experiment [18]. The lower Dirac\ncone disappears for the 1QL-slab [2,18], so only the upper Dirac cone is present in Fig.\n2(a). The major components of this band are the 6pz orbitals of the Bi atoms and the\n4px/4py orbitals of the surface Se atoms. This surface band consists of the spin-up and\nspin-down bands that are degenerate. The band structure of the 1QL-slab with a single Fe\nadsorbed in a 4\uf0b44\uf0b41 supercell [Fig. 2(b)] shows a splitting of the spin-up and spin-down\nDirac bands, which is due largely to their strong interactions with the spin-polarized Fe\n\n\f3dz2 states. The Fe 3dz2 interacts with the Bi* 6pz, and the Fe 3dxy and 3dx2-y2 with the\nSe* 4px and 4py. Consequently, the spin-polarized electrons of the Fe adatom interact\nstrongly with the conducting electrons of the TSS. The calculated moment of the Fe\nadatom (\uf07e2.9 \uf06dB) suggests the presence of approximately three unpaired electrons at the\nFe site. The projected density of states (PDOS) calculated for the Fe 3d states [Fig. 2(c)]\nsuggests an approximate crystal-field split pattern of the Fe 3d states depicted in Fig. 2(d).\nThe approximate electron configuration of Fe is a high-spin in between d6 and d7.\nApparent single-ion anisotropy. In opening a gap at the Dirac point by magnetic\nadatoms, it is necessary that the adatoms have the //c-spin orientation [3].To determine\nthe preferred spin-orientation due to the SOC effect, we calculate the SIA energy, A = E//c\n\uf02d E\uf05ec, using one Fe adatom per 4\uf0b44 supercell, where E//c and E\uf05ec are the energies with\nadatom spin-orientation parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis, respectively. Our\ncalculations show that A = -5.78 meV per Fe adatom for the B-site adsorption (A = -5.16\nmeV per Fe adatom for the A-site adsorption) when SOC effects are included on both the\nadatom Fe and the host Bi2Se3, showing that the Fe spin strongly prefers to align along\nthe c-direction. Therefore, our finding is entirely consistent with the experimental\nobservation of a massive Dirac fermion state in Bi2Se3 by chemical vapor deposition of\nFe atoms on its (111) surface [3]. The above calculation of the SIA energy is for dilute\nadsorption coverage (6.25% for one Fe adatom per 4\uf0b44 supercell). Thus, the effect of the\nspin exchange on the SIA energy would be negligible (see below). For the B-site\nadsorption, the E\uf05ec exhibits small in-plane anisotropy (see Fig. S3 [20]). For simplicity,\nthe average of the E\uf05ec values along the x- and y-axes will be used as E\uf05ec throughout this\n\n\fLetter.\nWe now examine why a Fe adatom on Bi2Se3 (111) surface exhibits apparently a\nlarge SIA energy by considering the B-site adsorption. We already have A = -5.78\nmeV/Fe when SOC effects are included on both the adatom Fe and the host Bi2Se3.\nFurther calculations show that A = -1.67 meV if SOC is allowed only on the Fe adatom, A\n= -4.93 meV if SOC is allowed only on the host Bi2Se3, and A = -4.91 meV if SOC is\nallowed only on the Fe, Bi* and Se* atoms. Thus, the apparent SIA of a Fe adatom arises\nlargely from the Bi* and Se* atoms surrounding it. Since the spin-orbit interaction \u03bbL \u2219 S\nis a local interaction [20,21], the above results indicate that the magnetic atom Fe induces\nspin polarization largely on the Bi* and Se* atoms, which gives rise to small spin\nmoments on them, and the SOC associated with these small spin moments leads to the\napparent SIA of the Fe adatom ([20], see below for further discussion). Thus, the apparent\nSIA of a Fe adatom, which is an important consequence of the adatom interaction with\nthe TSS electrons, should be included in a model Hamiltonian describing the adatom\ninteractions on TI surface because it has a significant influence on the spin orientation\n(see below, [20]).\nInteraction between adatoms. To describe how two magnetic adatoms interact on\nthe surface of a TI, we use the Hamiltonian [13,20,21]\ny y\n\nH = (Jzz S1z S2z + Jxx S1x S2x + Jyy S1 S2 ) + D \u2219 (S1 \u00d7 S2 ) + A[(S1z )2 + (S2z )2 ],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the first term describes the Heisenberg-Ising spin exchange between the adatoms,\nthe second term the DM interaction between them , and the last term is the SIA of the two\nadatoms, which should be included in Hamiltonian analysis according to our above\n\n\fdiscussions [20,21]. To determine the parameters Jii (i = x, y, z), D and A, we carry out\nenergy-mapping analysis [13] on the basis of density functional calculations by treating\nthe spin as unit vectors, i.e., |Si | = 1 (i = 1, 2) [20]. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we consider\nfive different pairs of Fe adatoms at the B-sites and evaluate their Jii (i = x, y, z) values.\nFor a pair of Fe adatoms occupying nearest-neighbor B sites, the relaxed distance R is\n4.009 \u00c5 (hereafter R \uf0bb 4.0 \u00c5), slightly shorter than the lattice constant 4.138 \u00c5. In\ncalculating the Jii values, we use the 4\uf0b44\uf0b41 supercell for the adatom pairs with R \uf0bb 4.0\nand 7.2 \u00c5, and the 8\uf0b44\uf0b41 supercell for those with R \uf0bb 8.3, 11.0 and 12.4 \u00c5 to avoid the\ndirect interaction between adjacent pairs.\nFor the pair with R \uf0bb 4.0 \u00c5, the spin exchanges are antiferromagnetic (AFM) and\nanisotropic, i.e., Jzz = 32.9 meV, Jxx = 34.9 meV, Jyy = 27.1 meV. If the SOC on Fe is\nswitched off, these spin exchanges hardly change. However, on switching off the SOC on\nthe host Bi2Se3, the spin exchanges and their anisotropy become strongly reduced, namely,\nJzz = 18.3 meV, Jxx = 18.8 meV, and Jyy = 18.8 meV. Thus, the conducting electrons of\nthe TSS enhance the spin exchange between the Fe adatoms. For the Fe adatom pair with\nR \u2248 7.2 \u00c5, the spin exchanges are ferromagnetic (FM) and anisotropic, i.e., Jzz =\n\u22129.8 meV, Jxx = \u221210.0 meV, Jyy = \u221215.3 meV. As summarized in Fig. 3 for the Jzz\nvalues, as an example, the sign of the spin exchange oscillates as R increases, following a\nRKKY-behavior. This is in agreement with the conclusion from the model Hamiltonian\nstudies [8,9,11]. The Jzz values calculated without SOC on all atoms, also plotted in Fig. 3,\nshow that the spin exchanges between adatoms are still strong even without SOC and\nfollow a RKKY-behavior. Namely, under the mediation of the TSS electrons, the spin\n\n\fexchange is a long-range interaction [3, 11].\nThe DM vector D is also evaluated by performing energy-mapping analysis [13].\nSymmetry analysis of the structures of the Fe adatom dimers shows that Dx = 0 for\nR \u2248 4.0 \u00c5, and Dx = Dz = 0 for R \u2248 7.2 \u00c5. The calculated DM vectors are consistent\nwith this analysis; Dx = 0, Dy = \u221210.1 meV, and Dz = 1.5 meV for R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5, while\nDx = \u22120.1 meV , Dy = 3.8 meV , Dz = 0 meV for R \u2248 7.2 \u00c5 [20]. The nonzero\ncomponent of the D vector is quite large compared with the spin exchange, i.e.,\n|Dy \u2044Jav | \uf0bb 0.3, where Jav is the average of Jxx , Jyy and Jzz . To understand the origin of\nthis large DM interaction, we selectively switch off the SOC on different atoms by\nconsidering the Fe dimer with R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5 as an example. With SOC only on the Bi2Se3\nhost, Dy = \u221210.8 meV and Dz = 0.5 meV. With SOC only on the Fe adatoms, however,\nDy = \u22120.7 meV and Dz = 1.2 meV. Thus, the DM interactions are also mediated by the\nconducting electrons of the TSS.\nFor the cases of two Fe adatoms on the (111) surface, the SIA A can also be\nevaluated by energy-mapping analysis [20], which shows that A depends on their distance\nR, e.g., A = -3.44 meV for R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5, and A = -6.63 meV for R \u2248 7.2 \u00c5. Nevertheless,\nthe preference for the //c-spin orientation at the B-sites remains unaffected by the\ninteractions between the adatoms mediated by the TSS electrons, nor by the thickness of\nthe slab used for calculations [20].\nEffect of electric field. Results of our calculations with electric field applied along\nthe z-axis [20] are summarized in Fig. 4(a) for the case of the R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5 Fe dimer.\nIncreasing the electric field weakens the Heisenberg-Ising spin exchange but strengthens\n\n\fthe DM interaction, raising the |Dy \u2044Jav | ratio up to \uf07e0.6 in support of the finding by Zhu\net al. [11]. The difference charge density plot obtained from the densities calculated for\nthe electric fields of -1.2 V/\u00c5 and 0 [Fig. 4(b)] shows that, with negative electric field,\nelectrons are transferred from the lower surface to the upper one, hence shifting the Fermi\nlevel and affecting the net magnetization as predicted by Zhu et al. [11] , with the canted\nmoment along the x-axis due to the large Dy. The field-induced change in the net\nmagnetic moment is large (e.g., 0.54 \u03bcB at 0.4 V/\u00c5 and 1.18\u03bcB at -1.2 V/\u00c5), suggesting\nthe possibility of tuning the net magnetization by electric field [20].\nFinally, we point out [20] that if the SIA is neglected, the spins of the magnetic\nadatoms should be nearly perpendicular to the c-axis and isotropic in the xz-plane. In\ncontrast, they should be nearly parallel to the c-axis and anisotropic in all three directions\nwhen the SIA is not neglected. This difference can be experimentally tested.\nConclusions. The essential elements needed in describing the magnetic interactions\nbetween Fe adatoms on the surface of the TI Bi2Se3 are the anisotropic Heisenberg-Ising\nspin exchange, the DM interaction, and the SIA. All these effects originate substantially\nfrom the interactions of the magnetic adatoms with the TSS conducting electrons. The\nDM interaction is strong with |D/J| \uf0bb 0.3, and the ratio can be further increased to \uf07e0.6 by\nan electric field applied along the z-axis. The apparent SIA of magnetic adatoms should\nnot be neglected.\nAcknowledgements.

Apparent SIA of a magnetic adatom induced by the spin-polarization of the TSS\nOur density functional calculations show that the magnetic adatom Fe\nspin-polarizes the electrons of the Bi* and Se* atoms. The small spin moments of Bi*\nand Se* induced by the spin polarization are antiparallel and parallel to that of Fe,\nrespectively. To demonstrate that the polarization of the TSS, induced by Fe, leads to a\nstrong apparent SIA, we consider the SOC effect on the p-states of Bi* as a representative\nexample.\nThe PDOS plots calculated for the p-states of Bi* (Fig. S1) around the Fermi level\nreveal that the three p-states |pz , \u2191>, |px , \u2193> and |py , \u2193> of Bi* are nearly degenerate\nin the absence of SOC on Bi2Se3, but become split in the presence of SOC on Bi2Se3. We\nnow examine this observation by considering how the |pz , \u2191>, |px , \u2193> and |py , \u2193>\nstates become split under the action of SOC on Bi* using the SOC Hamiltonian\nHSO = \u03bbL \u2219 S, where \u03bb is the SOC constant (\u03bb > 0 for the case of one electron occupying\nthe three p-states) and the L \u2219 S term is written as [S1]\n1\n\n1\n\nL \u2219 S = Sn (Lz cos\u03b8 + 2 L+ e\u2212i\u03c6 sin\u03b8 + 2 L\u2212 ei\u03c6 sin\u03b8)\n1\n\n\u03b8\n\n1\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\n+ 2 S+ (\u2212Lz sin\u03b8 \u2212 L+ e\u2212i\u03c6 sin2 2 + L\u2212 ei\u03c6 cos2 2)\n\n(S1)\n\n\u03b8\n\n+ 2 S\u2212 (\u2212Lz sin\u03b8 + L+ e\u2212i\u03c6 cos2 2 \u2212 L\u2212 ei\u03c6 sin2 2)\nIn terms of the spherical harmonics, the three p-states are expressed as\n|pz , \u2191>= |Y10 , \u2191>\n1\n\n|px , \u2193>= |\n\n\u221a2\n\n|py , \u2193>= |\n\n\u221a2\n\n\u2212i\n\n(Y11 + Y1\u22121 ), \u2193>\n(Y11 \u2212 Y1\u22121 ), \u2193>\n\nWe act the HSO on the three p-states to form the matrix M,\n\n(S2)\n\n\f< pz , \u2191 |\nM = (< px , \u2193 |) HSO (|pz , \u2191>\n< py , \u2193 |\n\n|px , \u2193>\n\n|py , \u2193>)\n\n(S3)\n\nDue to the rotational symmetry of Bi*, we take \u03c6 = 0 in Eq. (S1). We consider two spin\n\u03c0\n\norientations, \u03b8 = 0 and 2 , for which the spin of Bi* is parallel and perpendicular to the\nz-axis, respectively.\n(a) For \u03b8 = 0, we have\nM=\n\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\n0\n(1\ni\n\n1 \u2212i\n0\ni)\n\u2212i 0\n\n(S4)\n\nThe eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors are given as follow and in Fig. S2.\nE1 = \u2212\u03bb\u01272 ,\nE2 =\nE3 =\n\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c61 =\n\n\u221a3\n\n,\n\n\u03c62 =\n\n\u221a2\n\n,\n\n\u03c63 =\n\n1\n\n(i|pz , \u2191> \u2212i|px , \u2193> +|py , \u2193>)\n\n(|pz , \u2191> +|px , \u2193>)\n\n1\n\u221a2\n\n(S5)\n\n(|pz , \u2191> +i|py , \u2193>)\n\n\u03c0\n\n(b) For \u03b8 = 2 , we have\nM\u2032 =\n\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\n0 0\n(0 0\ni 0\n\n\u2212i\n0)\n0\n\n(S6)\n\nand\nE\u20321 = 0,\nE\u20322 = \u2212\nE\u20323 =\n\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\n,\n\n\u03c6\u20321 = |px , \u2193>\n\u03bb\u01272\n2\n\n,\n\n\u03c6\u2032 2 =\n\u03c6\u20323 =\n\n1\n\u221a2\n\n1\n\u221a2\n\n(|pz , \u2191> \u2212 i|py , \u2193>)\n\n(S7)\n\n(|pz , \u2191> +i|py , \u2193>)\n\nAs a result, the SOC favors the //z spin orientation (\u03b8 = 0) for the case of one\nelectron occupying the three states (Fig. S1). Note that the above discussion is valid for\nany fractional electron occupancy (less than 1) of the three levels, although we discussed\nas if there exists one whole electron to occupy them. The effect of SOC on the p-states of\nSe* can be discussed in a similar manner (not shown). As described in the main text, the\n\n\fcontributions of the Fe, Bi* and Se* should be taken together as a whole in considering\nthe SIA of a magnetic adatom Fe.\nFrom our first-principles calculations, A = E||z \u2013 E\u22a5z, which is consistent with the\nabove conclusion that leading the Fe spin favors the //z orientation. We also find a slight\nin-plane anisotropy of E\u22a5z term, which could be depicted as an A vs. \uf066 curve, as\npresented in Fig. S3. This in-plane anisotropy is substantial for the B-site adsorption of\nFe, but negligible for the A-site adsorption. Nevertheless, the variation of this in-plane\nanisotropy (from -5.08 meV to -6.51 meV) for the B-site adsorption is small compared\nwith the SIA, and we neglect it by taking the average of the maximum and the minimum\nSIA values, corresponding to (E||z \u2013E||x) and (E||z \u2013E||y), respectively.\n\n2. Determination of the parameters for the spin Hamiltonian from first-principles\ndensity functional calculations by energy-mapping analysis\nThe spin Hamiltonian describing the interaction between Fe adatoms on the surface\nof a TI can be written as\ny y\n\nH = (Jzz S1z S2z + Jxx S1x S2x + Jyy S1 S2 ) + D \u2219 (S1 \u00d7 S2 ) + A[(S1z )2 + (S2z )2 ]. (S9)\nTo carry out energy-mapping analysis, we select different broken-symmetry spin\nconfigurations, and determine the energy of each state from first-principles calculations.\n(Sx ,Sy ,Sz )\n\nWe use the notation E (S1\n\n(Sx ,Sy ,Sz )\n\nconfiguration, where Si\n\n(Sx ,Sy ,Sz )\n\n, S2\n\n) to represent the energy of the specific spin\n\n(i = 1, 2) is the spin orientation of each spin. Here we\n\ntreat each spin as unit vectors, i.e., |Si | = 1 (i = 1, 2).\n\n\fThe Heisenberg-Ising terms are obtained as follows:\n(1,0,0)\n\n2Jxx = E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n2Jyy = E(S1\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n2Jzz = E(S1\n\n, S2\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(\u22121,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n),\n\n(0,\u22121,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,\u22121)\n\n, S2\n\n),\n\n(S9)\n\n).\n\nThe direction of the DM vector D is constrained by the spatial structural symmetry [S1],\nand we first carry out the symmetry analysis and then perform the DFT calculations and\ncheck if they are consistent. In all cases, R = r2 \u2212 r1 is set to be the positive direction of\nthe x-axis. Considering the case of R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5 , this structure has a mirror plane\nperpendicular to R, locating at the midpoint of the segment linking the two adatoms. In\nthis case, D is parallel to the mirror plane, i.e., Dx = 0 [S1]. From the density\nfunctional point of view, we have\n(0,1,0)\n\n2Dx = E(S1\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,\u22121)\n\n2Dy = E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n2Dz = E(S1\n\n(0,0,\u22121)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(\u22121,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(0,\u22121,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(0,\u22121,0)\n\n),\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n),\n\n, S2\n\n, S2\n\n(\u22121,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(S10)\n\n).\n\nWhen R \u2248 7.2 \u00c5, the structure has a mirror plane parallel to R, containing the two\nadatoms. This would lead D perpendicular to the mirror plane, i.e., Dx = 0 and Dz = 0\n[S1]. In terms of first-principles DFT calculations, we have\n(0,1,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n2Dx = E(S1\n\n2Dy = E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n2Dz = E(S1\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(0,0,\u22121)\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(0,0,\u22121)\n\n),\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n),\n\n, S2\n\n, S2\n\n(0,\u22121,0)\n\n, S2\n\n).\n\n(S11)\n\n\fThe results from our DFT calculations are consistent with the symmetry analyses here.\n\nThe SIA energy A is simply given by A = E||z \u2013 E\u22a5z for the case of an isolated adatom. For\nthe case of two adatoms interacting, it is obtained as\n(0,0,1)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n, S2\n\n2A = E(S1\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,0,1)\n\n) \u2212 E(S1\n\n(1,0,0)\n\n) \u2212 Jzz + Jxx ,\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n, S2\n\n(0,1,0)\n\n) \u2212 Jzz + Jyy .\n\nor\n2A = E(S1\n\n(S12)\n\n3. Effects of different Hamiltonian terms on the spin orientations\nThe Hamiltonian, Eq. (S8), consists of the Heisenberg-Ising term, the DM\ninteraction term, and the SIA term. Here we discuss how these terms influences the\norientations of the two Fe spins by using the parameters obtained for the case of\nR \u2248 4.0 \u00c5 case, to show the SIA term is crucial for determining the spin orientation.\nFirst, we consider only the Heisenberg-Ising exchange interactions. The positive\nJii (i = x, y, z) makes the two spins have a collinear arrangement in the AFM state. If there\nis no anisotropy in the exchange interaction, the direction of these two spins is arbitrary.\nHowever, in our case, the anisotropy of Jzz, Jxx and Jyy would lead to a weak preference\nfor the spins to point along the x-axis (Jxx > Jyy, Jzz).\nSecond, neglecting the spin exchange and the SIA, we consider only the DM\ninteraction. The term D \u2219 (S1 \u00d7 S2 ) forces the two spins to be perpendicular to each\nother to have the maximum energy gain, which gives rise to a competition with the spin\nexchange that prefers collinear spin arrangements. The large Dy term makes the two spins\n\n\fperpendicular to each other in the xz-plane, and the small Dz term makes the spins\nslightly out of the xz-plane.\nNow we take the spin exchange and the DM interactions together. As a result of\ncompetition between the two interactions, we have AFM state along the x-axis dictated\nby Jxx (> Jyy, Jzz). Because the moment cancels along the x-axis, there must be canted\nmoments along the z- and the y-axes due to the DM interactions associated with Dy and\nDz, respectively [see Fig. S4(a)].\nFinally, we take the effect of the SIA into account. Obviously, the large A forces\nthe two spins to be (anti)parallel to the z-axis, overcoming their weak preference to align\nalong the x-direction. Now, we have AFM state with spins along the z-axis, which utilizes\nthe Jzz component and has no conflict with A. In this case, the large Dy forces the two\nspins to be aligned along the x-axis, thus leaving a canted moment along this direction.\nThe Jyy term puts the two spins antiparallel along the y-axis, and this is also favored by\nthe small Dz because a canted moment already exists along the x-axis [see Fig. S4(b)].\nTaken together, the SIA makes the spins of the magnetic adatoms to align along\nthe z-axis. Without the SIA, the spins lie nearly in the xy-plane because of the large Jxx\nand Dy. In the model Hamiltonian study of Zhu et al. [S2], in which the SIA and Dz terms\nare not included, and Jzz = Jxx \u2260 Jyy , there would be no anisotropy in the xz-plane.\nHowever, our calculations predict an anisotropic magnetic behavior along all the x-, yand z- directions. This difference can be tested experimentally.\n\n\f4. Simulation with 2QL- and 4QL-slabs\nTo validate the use of the results resulting from the 1QL-slab model of Bi2Se3, we\ncalculate the Jzz , Jyy and Dy values for two Fe adatoms (with R \u2248 4.0 \u00c5) adsorbed on\n2QL- and 4QL-slabs. It is noted that a pristine 4QL-slab exhibits a surface Dirac cone\n[S3], and a 3QL-slab was used to study the TSS by density functional calculations [S4].\nWe construct the structures of 2QL- and 4QL-slabs by using the 1QL-slab described as\nthe topmost QL holding the Fe adatoms and then by adding other QL(s) taken from the\npristine Bi2Se3 bulk below the topmost QL. Our calculations performed by using a 3\uf0b43\uf0b41\nk-point set show that A = \u22123.82 meV , Jzz = 36.75 meV , Jyy = 32.28 meV and\nDy = \u22127.06 meV for the 2QL-slab, while A = \u22125.07 meV , Jzz = 33.79 meV ,\nJyy = 30.45 meV and Dy = \u22128.26 meV for 4QL-slab. It is recalled that A =\n\u22123.44 meV, Jzz = 32.88 meV, Jyy = 27.11 meV and Dy = -10.07 meV for the\n1QL-slab. Although the calculated values fluctuate slightly, the negative large A and the\nlarge |D/J| ratio remain unchanged, and the relationship between Jzz , Jyy and Dy in the\n2QL- and 4QL-slabs is very similar to that observed for the 1QL-slab. These results\nensure that our results from the calculations on the 1QL-slab are valid.\n\n5. Effect of electric field\nIn their model Hamiltonian analysis of the RKKY interaction between magnetic\natoms on the surface of a TI, Zhu et al. [S2] concluded that the Fermi level can be tuned\nby electric field, and the magnetization can be controlled as a consequence. Indeed, our\ncalculations with electric field applied along the z-axis show that the magnetic\n\n\finteractions are delicately controlled by electric field. In our calculations the positive\nfield direction is along the positive direction of the z-axis. Our 1QL-slab is too thin to\napply a large electric field. However, with thicker slabs consisting of multiple QLs, a\nmuch stronger electric field can be applied to achieve Jii \uf0bb 0 so that a pure DM system\ncan be realized, as suggested by Zhu et al. [S2].\nWith the parameters of the model Hamiltonian [Eq. (1)] determined by density\nfunctional calculations [Fig. 4(a)], one can derive the most stable spin configuration at a\ngiven electric field. Our results for the case of R \uf0bb 4 \u00c5 show that the total magnetic\nmoment of the Fe pair cancels along the y- and z-axes (i.e., in AFM arrangement), but a\ntunable canted moment remains along the x-axis due to the large Dy . By analogy to the\nsurface magnetoelectric effect observed for thin films [S5], we describe how the surface\nmagnetic moment depends on applied electric field by calculating the surface\nmagnetoelectric coefficient \uf061s\n\u03b1s = \u03bc0 \u0394M/E,\n\n(S13)\n\nwhere \u0394M is the magnetization introduced by the applied electric field E, and \uf06d0 is the\nmagnetic permeability of free space. By linearly fitting the calculated magnetic moment\nas a function of E, we obtain \u03b1s \u2248 \u22122.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 Gcm2 /V, which is much larger than the\nsurface magnetoelectric coefficient of Fe film (\u03b1s \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10\u221214 Gcm2 /V) [S5]. This\nsuggests that the total magnetization of a TI possessing magnetic adatoms on its surface\ncan be delicately controlled by electric field.\n\n\fReferences\n[S1] D. Dai, H. J. Xiang, M.-H.

With one electron to occupy\nthe resulting three states, the SOC favors the z-axis orientation.\n\n\fFigure S3. The SIA vs. \uf066 curve calculated for the Fe adatom adsorbed on the B-site of\nBi2Se3 (111), where the in-plane sweep angle \uf066 is defined such that the direction for \uf066 =\n0\uf0b0 is parallel to one Se*-Se* edge of the Se*3 triangle.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure S4. (color online). The spin orientations predicted (a) in the absence and (b) in the\npresence of MAE by using the model Hamiltonian with the parameters determined from\nfirst-principles DFT calculations.\n\n\f"}
