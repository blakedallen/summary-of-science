Such accelerated expansion is caused by presence of some antigravitating substance which act as repulsive force in the Universe.\nThe immediate observation of this substance is sufficiently hard due to its weak interaction with electromagnetic\nradiation. In this connection this substance was called dark energy (DE). The true nature of DE remains a puzzle\ntill now. The simplest model is a description of DE as a constant \u039b-term (the so-called \u039bCDM model, see [2], for\nexample). However, at the present time it is rather difficult to find physically proved explanation of a value and\nnature of the \u039b-term.\nIn this connection, consideration of dynamical models of DE with the varying equation of state seems to be more\nnatural. In this case the effective equation of state of DE corresponds to w < \u22121/3, while for the \u039bCDM model\nw = \u22121. All the models laying in these limits on w can be divided into two big categories: 1) the source of DE\nis different scalar fields (quintessence models, Chaplygin gas, etc. [3, 4, 5]); 2) presence of DE is a consequence of\nmodification of the Einstein gravitational equations by addition of terms depending on scalar curvature, invariants of\nthe Ricci and Riemann tensors, etc. [6, 7, 8, 9]. Consideration of the evolution of the present Universe within the\nframework of these models allows to achieve the certain success in quantitative comparison of theoretical results with\nobservations.\nHowever, the recent observations [10] have shown that w \u2264 \u22121 (see Ref. [11] where this phenomenon is described\nby a model-independent way). Such a type of DE, also known as phantom energy [12], can be introduced within the\nframework of both directions mentioned above. In particular, in case of scalar fields phantom energy is realized by\nchange of a sign before a kinetic term in a field Lagrangian. Choosing, further, a certain form of potential energy of\nthis field, it is possible to get a satisfactory agreement with observations by selecting parameters of a model (see, e.g.,\n[13] and references therein). On the other hand, one can try to model an inflation in the early Universe using phantom\nfields [14] and consider quantum evolution of the early Universe within the framework of phantom cosmology [15].\nPhantom DE for two scalars (where only one of scalars is phantom) was considered in [16]. The idea of unification of\ninflation with acceleration for phantoms was proposed in [17]. The paper [18] is devoted to the analysis of conformally\ncoupled phantom scalar fields. The authors apply the Ziglin theory of integrability and find that the flat model is\nnonintegrable. It means that we cannot expect to determine simple analytical solutions of the Einstein equations.\nThe metric presented here shows the same: a solution of the Einstein equations coupled with two interacting scalar\nfields can be found only in a numerical form. General review on modified gravity as DE one can find in [19].\nAnother possible application of phantom scalar fields consists in modelling of the so-called spacelike branes (Sbranes) with their help. The S-branes are topological defects localized on a spacelike hypersurface. An example of\nsuch a solution is a domain wall in a 4D scalar field theory [20]. In this model the theory of one scalar field with\n\n\u2217\n\nSenior Associate of the Abdus Salam ICTP\naddress: dzhun@krsu.edu.kg\n\u2021 Electronic address: vfolomeev@mail.ru\n\u00a7 Electronic address: cnlpmyra@satsun.sci.kz\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\neffective potential energy with spontaneous symmetry breaking is under consideration. This effective potential has\ntwo minima. For a static case, this problem has the well-known solutions in the form of kinks [21]. These solutions\nstart from one minimum (at x \u2192 \u2212\u221e) and tend asymptotically to another minimum of the effective potential (at\nx \u2192 +\u221e). However, if one consider phantom fields, the similar solutions in a form of kink will be obtained not for\nthe space variable x but for the time t. This so-called S2-brane solution is a timelike kink [22].\nIn this paper we consider a model of S-brane formed by two phantom fields having local and global minima. Below\nwe show that solutions similar to the soliton-like solutions mentioned above could exist and for a case when an effective\npotential is choosing in the form of two interacting scalar fields (3). This potential is an analog of the well-known\nmodel with one scalar field with a Mexican hat potential. The fundamental difference of these two potentials consists\nin presence of two scalar fields in (3) that provide existence not only kink-like solutions but also another types of\nsoliton-like solutions.\nII.\n\nEQUATIONS\n\nLet us consider the flat cosmological Friedmann model with the metric:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a(t)2 (dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ).\n\n(1)\n\nThe Lagrangian for phantom scalar fields \u03c6, \u03c7 plus gravitation is:\nL=\u2212\n\n1\n1\nR\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2202 \u03bc \u03c7 \u2212 V (\u03c6, \u03c7),\n16\u03c0G 2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) =\n\n\u03bb1 2\n\u03bb2\n(\u03c6 \u2212 m21 )2 + (\u03c72 \u2212 m22 )2 + \u03c62 \u03c72 \u2212 V0 .\n4\n4\n\n(3)\n\nHere V0 is defining by initial conditions and can be considered as a cosmological constant \u039b.

[23] the research of mathematically similar equations have been carried out. Those equations describe the\nthick brane in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. It was shown that at choice of the potential in the form (11), there are\nthe regular solutions describing the thick brane. Such solutions can be obtained only if the potential has local and\nglobal minima. In the context of Ref. [23], the specified scalar fields could be interpreted as a condensate of a gauge\nfield.\nHaving a purpose to obtain regular cosmological solutions, we choose phantom fields with the given potential as a\nmodel of scalar field. In this case Eqs. (7)-(10) are mathematically similar to the equations describing the thick brane\nin Ref. [23].\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL ANALYSIS\n\nFor the numerical calculations we choose the following values of the parameters and initial conditions:\n\u221a\n\u221a\na0 = 1, \u03c60 = 3, \u03c70 = 1.8, \u03bb1 = 0.1, \u03bb2 = 1.0.\n\n(16)\n\nWe apply the methods of step by step approximation for finding of numerical solutions (the details of similar calculations can be found in Ref. [23]).\n\u221a\nStep 1. On the first step we solve Eq. (9) (having zero approximations a0 (t) = a0 et , \u03c70 (t) = 0.6/ cosh2 (t/4)).\nThe regular solution exists for a special value m\u22171,i only. For m1 < m\u22171,i the function \u03c6i (t) \u2192 +\u221e and for m1 > m\u22171,i\nthe function \u03c6i (t) \u2192 \u2212\u221e (here the index i is the approximation number). One can say that in this case we solve a\nnon-linear eigenvalue problem: \u03c6\u2217i (t) is the eigenstate and m\u22171,i is the eigenvalue on this Step.\nStep 2. On the second step we solve Eq. (10) using zero approximation a0 (t) for the function a(t) and the first\napproximation \u03c6\u22171 (t) for the function \u03c6(t) from the Step 1. For m2 < m\u22172,1 the function \u03c71 (t) \u2192 +\u221e and for m2 > m\u22172,1\nthe function \u03c71 (t) \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Again we have a non-linear eigenvalue problem for the function \u03c7\u22171 (t) and m\u22172,1 .\nStep 3. On the third step we repeat the first two steps that to have the good convergent sequence \u03c6\u2217i (t), \u03c7\u2217i (t).\nPractically we have made three approximations.\nStep 4. On the next step we solve Eq. (8) which gives us the function a1 (t).\nStep 5. On this step we repeat Steps 1-4 necessary number of times that to have the necessary accuracy of\ndefinition of the functions a\u2217 (t), \u03c6\u2217 (t), \u03c7\u2217 (t) and the eigenvalues m\u22171,2 .\nAfter Step 5 we have the solution presented in Figs. (1), (2). These numerical calculations give us the eigenvalues\nm\u22171 = 2.98530175, m\u22172 = 2.538974725 and eigenstates a\u2217 (t), \u03c6\u2217 (t), \u03c7\u2217 (t).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe toy model of inflation in the early Universe with account of the phantom fields is considered. The possibility\nof obtaining of bounce solutions is shown in principle. In this case the model evolves from a stage of contraction\n(\u0227 < 0), passes through a minimum of the scale factor (a0 \u223c 1 in the Planck units) and appears on the de Sitter stage\nof expansion (Fig. (2)). Such evolution is provided in the model by a special form of the potential for the phantom\nfields (11).\n\n\f4\n\n3,0\n\n0,4\n\n( )\n\n2,5\n\n0,2\n\n2,0\n\n0,0\n\n1,5\n\n( )\n\n1,0\n\n-0,2\n\n0,5\n\n-0,4\n\n0,0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: The graphs for the scalar fields \u03c6\u2217 (t), \u03c7\u2217 (t).

Only at the obtained values of m\u22171 , m\u22172 , the solutions are regular and a bounce and an\ninflation take place. At other values of these parameters, the solutions are singular.\nLet us note that at the obtained values of the parameters m1,2 = m\u22171,2 , the de Sitter stage occurs over an infinite\nperiod of time. But if |m1,2 \u2212 m\u22171,2 | \u226a 1 than there is a finite time of inflation of the Universe.\nThe obtained solutions could be interpreted as S2-brane solutions for a case of two interacting phantom scalar\nfields. But in contrast to the usual kink-like S2-brane solutions [20, 22], our solutions are another type of soliton-like\nsolutions. If the kink solution starts from one minimum of a potential and tends asymptotically to another one, our\nsolutions start and finish in the same minimum (in the case under consideration, in the local minimum \u03c6 = m1 , \u03c7 = 0,\nsee Fig. (1)). By the terminology of [21], the kink-like solutions refer to topological solutions and our solutions - to\nnon-topological ones. In contrast to the kink-like solutions which exist only in a case of presence of two minima, the\nexistence of non-topological solutions is also possible at one minimum only.\n\n[1] A.
