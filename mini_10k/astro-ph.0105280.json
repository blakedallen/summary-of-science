Despite intensive efforts, only\nsmall or subtle evolution has been detected in the number density of field galaxies (eg, Lilly et al.\n1995; Heyl et al. 1997; Hogg 1998; Lin et al. 1999; Cohen 2002), in their masses (eg, Vogt et al.\n1996, 1997; Treu et al. 1999; Brinchmann & Ellis 2000; Cohen 2002), or in their clustering relative\nto \"stable clustering\" (eg, Le F\u00e9vre et al. 1996; Carlberg et al. 1997; Small et al. 1999; Hogg et al.\n2000; Carlberg et al. 2000), from redshift unity to the present day. At the same time, the constraints\non galaxy evolution have not been made strong enough to allow definitive results from the classical\ncosmological tests. Has the galaxy evolution community got anything positive to say? Indeed it\nhas.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nFor a long time it has been observed that apparently faint and (at one time presumed to be, now\nlargely known to be) distant galaxies are, on average, bluer in color than their local counterparts\n(eg, Koo & Kron 1992, and references therein). This was attributed to higher star-formation rates\nor younger ages at earlier times. As the data on distant galaxies has improved, this conclusion has\nbeen bolstered, with photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning the full electromagnetic\nspectrum.\nOften, the literature on galaxy evolution focuses on disagreements between star-formation rate\nmeasurements, as it should, since such disagreements ought to point to important issues in selection\neffects, dust extinction, the initial mass function of stars, and stellar population syntheses (eg, Cowie\net al. 1999; Bell & Kennicutt 2001; Hopkins et al. 2001; Sullivan et al. 2001). What is much more\nremarkable than the disagreements between the measurements, however, is the very important\nrespect in which virtually all studies of galaxy star-formation rates agree: The star-formation rate\ndensity in normal galaxies has been declining from redshift unity towards the present day.\nIt is of great importance that the star-formation measurements span a number of different observational techniques, a number of different regions in the electromagnetic spectrum, and a number\nof physically different star-formation indicators. The different studies suffer from different selection\neffects and have different sensitivities to dust extinction and the stellar initial mass function. For\nexample, as the absorption due to dust in a star-forming galaxy increases, the ultraviolet luminosity\ndecreases, the optical H\u03b1 line decreases by less, the radio emission from supernovae is unaffected,\nand the far-infrared emission actually increases. The different measurements are also performed\nby different groups of investigators, with different approaches and different preconceptions. This\nheterogeneity of the confirming evidence makes the decline in star-formation rate density the most\nsecure result in galaxy evolution, and one of the most secure in all of astrophysics.\nIn what follows, a quantitative meta-analysis of the star-formation history literature is performed, in which the declines inferred from different observational studies are compared in a fair\nway, to establish the consistency of the literature and combine the measurements responsibly. Because of the \"responsibility\" constraint, many studies relevant to questions of star-formation rate\nhave been dropped from the meta-analysis; even though almost all of them support the final conclusions.\nThe star-formation rate measurements in question are measurements of mean comoving cosmic\nstar formation rate density \u03c1\u0307\u2217 , the average mass in stars formed per unit time per unit comoving volume. As discussed below, except where specifically noted, all reported measurements are corrected\nto a cosmological world model with (h, \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.7, 0.3, 0.7), where H0 = 100 h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand \u03a9M and \u03a9\u039b are the present-day, scaled densities of matter and cosmological constant (eg, Hogg\n1999).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nStar formation indicators\n\nAs emphasized above, confidence in the result that star formation is evolving comes from from\nthe heterogeneity of star formation indicators that show similar evolution.\n\n2.1.\n\nRest-frame ultraviolet continuum\n\nShort-lived stars tend to have high temperatures, so the ultraviolet continuum of galaxies is an\nindicator of recent star formation. With optical telescopes, near-ultraviolet wavelengths \u03bb \u223c 2500 \u00c5\ncan be observed in the U (or similar) bandpass at redshifts z > 0.4. A stellar population created\nin a short burst is bright at 2500 \u00c5 for \u223c 20 Myr (eg, Bruzual A. & Charlot 1993; Leitherer &\nHeckman 1995) because only short-lived stars emit at these wavelengths.\nThe near-ultraviolet luminosity of a galaxy is a direct measure of its young stellar population,\nand therefore a good indicator of recent star formation activity. The primary disadvantage of this\nindicator is that it is strongly affected by dust extinction; correction for extinction requires good\nknowledge of the reddening law in the near-ultraviolet and the geometry of the dust relative to the\nstars (eg, Calzetti et al. 1994). Another disadvantage is that ultraviolet continuum can be produced\nby nuclear activity; in fact possible contamination by nuclear activity is a disadvantage of all of\nthe indicators.\nAt redshifts z < 0.4, the 2500 \u00c5 emission can only be estimated from the ground by extrapolation from the visual and near-ultraviolet. This is a disadvantage, because the extrapolation\ndepends on the shape of the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the ultraviolet; this is very\nsensitive to small amounts of dust or small changes in star formation history and activity. The\nforthcoming GALEX mission (Martin et al. 1997), which will obtain ultraviolet imaging of normal\nnearby galaxies, will solve this problem.\n\n2.2.\n\nH\u03b1 emission line\n\nThe H\u03b1 line is emitted in the recombination spectrum of hydrogen; it is a star formation\nindicator because only short-lived stars produce significant luminosity in photons with energies\nabove the hydrogen ionization energy 13.6 eV.\nBecause it involves ionization and recombination, the H\u03b1 line is in some sense a less-direct\nindicator of recent star formation. However, it is weighted towards even higher-mass (and therefore\nshorter-lived) stars. It is also less affected by dust extinction (though not completely insensitive).\nThe indicator has the disadvantage that in a significant fraction of galaxies, the total H\u03b1 luminosity\ncan be dominated by an active nucleus.\nAt redshifts near unity, H\u03b1 can only be measured with near-infrared spectrographs. Some such\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ninstruments are now on-line, but measurements of line strengths in faint galaxies have not been\nmade in large numbers. This is likely to change in the near future.\n\n2.3.\n\nNear-ultraviolet emission lines\n\nUltraviolet radiation from stars ionizes many atomic species, not just hydrogen, and several\nof these species emit bright lines in the optical and near-ultraviolet in their recombination spectra.\nThe most prominent and useful line is the forbidden [O II] line at 3727 \u00c5, because it is bright and\nvisible in optical spectrographs in a wide redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.3. Because the line is forbidden,\nit is a collisionally excited transition emitted by Oxygen in ionization regions with electron densities\nn \u223c 104 cm\u22123 . These conditions are common around very young and forming stars.\nIn the local Universe, [O II] emission appears to be closely related to H\u03b1 emission (Kennicutt\n1992), so it is a reasonable tracer of star formation. However, its strength depends on the metallicity,\ndensity, and dust content of the nebular gas, so the relationship between line luminosity and star\nformation rate is expected to have a much greater variance than that for the H\u03b1 line. Its primary\nadvantage is in redshift coverage.\nThe [O II] line shares the disadvantage that it can be contaminated by nuclear activity.\n\n2.4.\n\nFar-infrared continuum\n\nStar forming regions are often very dusty; thick dust surrounding young stars will absorb\nultraviolet and optical emission and re-emit it at far-infrared wavelengths 30 < \u03bb < 200 \u03bcm. Since\nshort-lived stars are far more luminous than long-lived stars (by a factor which overwhelms their\nrelative scarcity in typical initial mass functions), the far-infrared luminosity of a galaxy may be\napproximately the bolometric luminosity of its dust-enshrouded, short-lived stars. This makes it a\nstar-formation indicator.\nFar-infrared emission is a less direct indicator than ultraviolet flux, but it has opposite sensitivity to dust; dustier galaxies are better measured, while pristine galaxies are missed. It has\nthe enormous disadvantage that the far infrared cannot be measured directly at ground-based telescopes. It must be inferred from sub-millimeter and near-infrared measurements. The study of\nfar-infrared emission will be revolutionized with the SIRTF mission. There is an additional problem that the far-infrared emission can have a substantial contribution from an active nucleus, and\nthe visual extinction makes it difficult to differentiate sources of luminosity (eg Sanders & Mirabel\n1996, and references therein).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.5.\n\nRadio continuum\n\nA short time \u223c 30 Myr after a burst of star formation, stars with masses M > 8 M\u2299 complete\nmost of their nuclear burning and explode in what are expected to be Type II and Type Ib supernovae, although the evidence for this association is not iron-clad (eg, Filippenko 1997, and references\ntherein). These supernovae and their remnants are bright at radio frequencies 1 < \u03bd < 100 GHz\nfor t \u223c 100 Myr (eg, Condon 1992, and references therein).\nRadio observations have the great advantage that they are insensitive to dust. Star formation\nmeasurement is not rocket science, but the radio indicator is the least well-calibrated, simply\nbecause the energetics of radio supernovae are less well-understood than other aspects of stellar\npopulations. Like the other indicators, radio measurements can be contaminated by active nuclei,\nwhich, at faint levels, are not easily distinguished from supernovae.\n\n2.6.\n\nOther methods\n\nMany other methods have been suggested but wait for new data. It has been suggested that\nthe X-ray sources created by stellar evolution could be used as an indicator (Ghosh & White 2001).\nMuch work is going into understanding the winds from forming and young stellar populations (eg,\nKudritzki & Puls 2000, and references therein); one can imagine measuring star formation rates\nusing mechanical, rather than electromagnetic, luminosity. When the SIRTF mission is able to\ncalibrate the relationships between strong mid-infrared spectral features from interstellar molecules\nand the ultraviolet radiation fields that excite the transitions (eg, Li & Draine 2002), there will be\na new industry of understanding star formation activity via the mid-infrared.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nMethod and results\nStudies excluded\n\nThis meta-analysis is of star-formation rate variation within a single observational study, at\nredshifts z < 1. For this reason, no study was included in this meta-analysis if it did not report\nmore than one independent z \u2264 1 star-formation rate measurement. This excluded several otherwise\nrelevant studies (eg, Connolly et al. 1997; Madau et al. 1998; Treyer et al. 1998; Yan et al. 1999;\nSullivan et al. 2000; Thompson et al. 2001). An exception was made for a group of very similar\nsurveys for H\u03b1 line luminosity density, which were put together to make a \"combined H\u03b1\" study,\ndescribed below.\nSeveral relevant studies were dropped because the targets were selected or the results were\npresented such that the results could not be fairly used as cosmic star-formation rate measurements\n(eg, Schade et al. 1996; Cowie et al. 1997; Guzman et al. 1997; Lilly et al. 1998; Blain et al. 1999),\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nor because estimates of measurement uncertainties were not provided (eg, Cram 1998).\nOnly publications appearing in the refereed literature prior to 2002 August 1 were considered.\n\n3.2.\n\nStudies included\n\nThe cuts left ten studies (Lilly et al. 1996; Hammer et al. 1997; Rowan-Robinson et al. 1997;\nHogg et al. 1998; Cowie et al. 1999; Flores et al. 1999; Mobasher et al. 1999; Haarsma et al. 2000;\nJones & Bland-Hawthorn 2001). Notes on individual studies are given in Table 1, but in most\ncases, the confidence interval on each star-formation-rate-density \u03c1\u0307\u2217 point was measured (with a\nruler) from the relevant Figure in each paper. The measured points are shown in Figure 1. At any\nredshift, there is a large scatter.\nIn addition to the primary ten studies, three very similar studies of the cosmic H\u03b1 line luminosity density (Gallego et al. 1995; Tresse & Maddox 1998; Glazebrook et al. 1999), each measuring\nthe density at a different redshift, were combined into a single \"combined H\u03b1\" study, which was\nincluded as if it were an additional individual study.\n\n3.3.\n\nData fitting\n\nEach data point, centered on some redshift z, was crudely \"corrected\" to the default world\nmodel used in this paper by the correction factor\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\ne2\nDL2\nD\nL\n(1)\nf=\ndVC /dz\ndVeC /dz\n\nwhere DL and VC are the luminosity distance and comoving volume (eg Hogg 1999) out to z in the\ne L and VeC are the same but for\ncosmological world model employed in the study in question, and D\nthe fiducial world model (h, \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.7, 0.3, 0.7) used here. This world-model correction makes\ntwo assumptions: The first is that the star-formation indicators have been calibrated somehow\nindependently of Hubble constant, in the sense that a change in the Hubble constant changes the\ninferred luminosity and inferred star formation rate by the same factor. The second is that each\nreported data point can be treated as well-localized at its redshift; for the precisions reported in\nthese studies this ought to be fine.\n\nLinear fitting to the model \u03c1\u0307\u2217 \u221d (1 + z)\u03b2 was performed in log(\u03c1\u0307\u2217 ) space with points weighted\naccording to their reported uncertainties. By this procedure, the confidence intervals reported in\nthe individual studies are treated as representing Gaussian uncertainties in log(\u03c1\u0307\u2217 ) space. In detail,\nof course, this assumption is incorrect, but since none of the studies is extremely precise and since\nmost of the reported uncertainties are not accurate (most only include the Poisson contribution),\nthe assumption does not significantly affect the results. The best-fit \u03b2 values and the linear-fitting\nuncertainties provided by the covariance matrix are given in Table 1 and shown in Figure 2.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.4.\n\nResults\n\nThe weighted mean (using the inverse variances from the linear fits as weights) of the best-fit\n\u03b2 values is \u03b2 = 2.74 \u00b1 0.28, a nominal ten-sigma result.\nAll but two of the \u03b2 measurements are consistent (at \u223c 2 \u03c3) with the weighted mean. In detail,\nthe weighted mean relies on the assumption that the studies have reported accurate uncertainties;\nbut weighted and unweighted mean values barely differ. Of the two outliers, one (Hammer et al.\n1997) appears to be an outlier simply because it carries such a small uncertainty; most of the\nstudies report only Poisson contributions to their error budgets, so the uncertainties are better\ntreated as lower limits. The other outlier (Mobasher et al. 1999) is more problematic, but the\nsample is small (only 23 galaxies in the z \u223c 0.5 point), the sample is cut on both radio power and\noptical magnitude (at a fairly bright R < 21.5 mag), and sources spectrally classified as having\nactive nuclei were excluded (roughly 25 percent of the sample).\nGiven the underestimated measurement uncertainties, a much more conservative method for\ncomputing a mean with a reasonable confidence interval is the bootstrap resampling technique. In\neach of 104 trials, ten studies were randomly chosen (with replacement) from the group of ten and\na weighted mean (using inverse variances from the linear fits as weights) for \u03b2 was computed. Note\nthat each trial will have some studies repeated, some missing. From the 104 weighted means, the\nlowest and highest 16 percent were discarded, leaving the central 68-percent confidence region. This\nregion has a central value and extent of \u03b2 = 2.7 \u00b1 0.7. This is a conservative but robust estimate\nof the average value for \u03b2. As described above, all measurements have been corrected to a world\nmodel with (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.3, 0.7).\nIf all results are transformed to an Einstein-de Sitter Universe with (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (1.0, 0.0), the\nbootstrap-resampling 68-percent confidence interval is \u03b2 = 3.3 \u00b1 0.8.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite the scatter in Figure 1, the decline in comoving star-formation rate density \u03c1\u0307\u2217 from\nredshift unity to the present day is well confirmed by multiple studies. The best average value\nof the evolution exponent \u03b2, in the parameterization \u03c1\u0307\u2217 \u221d (1 + z)\u03b2 , is \u03b2 = 2.7 \u00b1 0.7. This value\nis only four standard deviations from zero, but the confidence interval is computed in the most\nconservative way (resampling); the straightforward weighted mean of the measurements gives a\nten-sigma result.\nIn addition, almost all faint-galaxy studies which are relevant, but for one reason or another\ncould not be included in this meta-analysis, bolster the conclusion that the star-formation rate has\nbeen dropping since redshift unity. Faint galaxies are bluer than nearby galaxies (eg, Koo & Kron\n1992; Smail et al. 1995; Williams et al. 1996). The surface brightnesses, colors, and line emission\nof normal galaxy disks appear to have all been dropping (Schade et al. 1996; Lilly et al. 1998);\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe same appears true for blue compact galaxies (Guzman et al. 1997). The luminosity functions\nof blue galaxies and star-forming galaxies have been evolving (Lilly et al. 1995; Heyl et al. 1997;\nCram 1998; Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al. 1999; Lin et al. 1999). Models of mid-infrared and sub-millimeter\nsource counts may require a drop in star-formation activity since redshift unity (Blain et al. 1999;\nElbaz et al. 1999). It is difficult to understand the observed chemical evolution of damped Ly\u03b1\nabsorbers without much higher star formation activity at redshift unity than the present day (Pei\n& Fall 1995; Pei et al. 1999). Perhaps more indirect, the fraction of galaxies classified as \"irregular\"\nappears to be dropping with cosmic time (eg, Griffiths et al. 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Odewahn\net al. 1996; van den Bergh et al. 2000), and irregulars, locally, have above-average star-formation\nrates.\nThe mere consistency of these star-formation studies is only half the story. It is equally important that the studies span a wide range of observational techniques, and a range of physically\ndifferent star-formation indicators. This heterogeneity makes their consistency much more impressive and much more convincing. In particular the different methods have different sensitivities to\ndust extinction and the slope of the initial mass function of stars; it is hard to argue that the\nobserved trends are conspiracies of dust and mass function variability.\nThe evolution in star-formation rates is the most secure result in the field of galaxy evolution.\nIncidentally, this also makes it the strongest argument from galaxy evolution against the pure\nsteady-state model of cosmic origins (Bondi & Gold 1948; Hoyle 1948).\nIf the best-fit value of \u03b2 and its conservatively estimated uncertainty are taken at face value,\nthen \u03b2 > 1.3 in the (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.3, 0.7) world model and \u03b2 > 1.5 in the (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (1.0, 0.0)\nworld model. In either case, this implies that not only has the comoving star formation rate\ndensity \u03c1\u0307\u2217 (z) been declining since redshift unity, but so has t(z) \u03c1\u0307\u2217 (z), the comoving star formation\ndensity per logarithmic interval in cosmic time. This function t(z) \u03c1\u0307\u2217 (z) more accurately represents\nthe formation time of the bulk of stars. Because \u03b2 is above the logarithmically divergent value\n(\u03b2 > 1.3 in the default world model), most of the stellar mass at the present day ought to be in old\n(> 6 Gyr) stellar populations. This is the primary \"prediction\" of this meta-analysis; it appears to\nbe consistent with the data (Fukugita et al. 1998; Hogg et al. 2002).\nIn addition to observations of distant galaxies, we have another powerful and independent\n\"fossil record\" of galaxy formation and evolution: Our own Galaxy contains stellar populations\nformed over the entire history of the Universe. The star formation history of the Galaxy can\nbe inferred from its internal distribution of apparent stellar ages. Unfortunately, the distribution\nmeasured in the Solar neighborhood is not consistent with a large decline in the Galaxy's star\nformation rate over the last \u223c 8 Gyr (Barry 1988; Pardi & Ferrini 1994; Prantzos & Silk 1998;\nRocha-Pinto et al. 2000; Gizis et al. 2002). Is the Milky Way atypical? Or, perhaps more likely,\nit may be that measurements of the age distribution in the solar neighborhood not representative\nof the Galaxy as a whole; this is likely if a galaxy's stars are formed from the inside out. The\nresolution of this inconsistency between high-redshift and Milky-Way determinations of the star-\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nformation rate may lead to great progress in cosmology and galaxy evolution.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Mike Blanton, Karl Glazebrook, Deborah Haarsma, Heath Jones,\nJim Peebles, David Schlegel, Rosemary Wyse and Sara Zimmerman for help with the literature,\nscientific discussions, and software.
