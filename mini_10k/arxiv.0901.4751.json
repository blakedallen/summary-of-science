Of the possible platforms on which to implement these algorithms, spins in coupled\nquantum dots (CQDs) are thought to be excellent candidates for qubits as they can be initialized,\nmanipulated and measured through optical spectroscopy. Progress has been made through the\nuse of single quantum dots (SQDs) in implementing optical quantum gates [2], ultra fast control\nof spin excitons [3], and entanglement of the electron-hole complexes [4]. The need for\nscalability has led to increasing interest in CQDs where one may have new options in controlling\nthe spin and charge states along with their coupling and interactions [5]. Encoding and\nmanipulation of spins have already been demonstrated in different solid state systems, such as\nthe phenomena of quantum interference have been utilized for spin manipulation in SQDs with\ncoherent micro spectroscopy techniques [6]. Furthermore coherent manipulation of spins has\nbeen demonstrated in quantum two level systems [7].\nIn this paper we investigate, through optical spectroscopy, the control of exchange\ninteraction by spatially separating the electron and hole in a CQD system. Measurement of the\nisotropic electron-hole exchange splitting between the bright and dark exciton can be performed\nin CQD systems without the use of an applied magnetic field [8]. However, the anisotropic\nexchange splitting tends to be small and difficult to measure (even in the intradot exciton). It\n\n\fmay however be possible, through polarization measurements, to gain insight into the details of\nthe anisotropic exchange interaction as the CQD is selectively tuned with electric field.\nIn general the magnitude of the exchange interaction depends on the overall spin state\nalong with the spatial overlap of the electrons and holes. Therefore when both electron and hole\nare in the bottom dot the peaks of the amplitudes of the wave functions gives rise to maximum\noverlaps hence, maximum exchange interaction. But when the electron and hole are spatially\nseparated and reside in top and bottom dots, as in the case of an indirect exciton, the overlap of\nthe wave functions reduces giving rise to a lower exchange interaction which tends to zero as we\nincreasingly separate the electron and the hole.\nEXPERIMENT\nSelf-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots grown in the S-K mode were used in this study.\nTo control the relative energy levels of the two dots and selectively charge them, the CQDs were\nembedded in a Schottky diode structure with an n-doped back contact and a semitransparent Ti\ntop contact which allows the application of an electric field along the growth direction. The\nasymmetric nature of the CQDs gives rise to energy level resonances under desired bias voltages\nwhich is a vital step in implementing spin manipulation for quantum information process [9,10].\nFurther, lithographically defined submicron apertures are created with aluminum mask to\noptically probe individual quantum dots. Samples were kept at cryogenic temperatures and were\nexcited with a Ti: Sapphire laser operated in CW mode. The detection is made using a triple\ngrating spectrometer coupled to a liquid-nitrogen cooled CCD detector.\nMapping the charge and spin states is done using bias maps which are three dimensional\ncontour plots with applied electric field, PL spectral energy, and PL intensity represented by 'x',\n'y', and 'z' coordinates respectively. Similar to previously studied single dot bias maps [11], in\nCQDs we recognize strong PL lines that show little electric field dependence and are identified\nas various intra-dot charged exciton states. Relative to the neutral exciton (X0), the positively\ncharged exciton (positive trion X+) is found to be typically ~2 meV higher in energy, whereas the\nnegatively charged exciton (negative trion X\u2212) is ~6 meV lower and new features such as large\nE-field dependence, anticrossings, and 'X' pattern can be identified in CQD spectra [10]. These\nnew features arise from tunnel coupling of the hole states resulting in the formation of molecular\nstates. This leads to anticrossings observed in the PL spectra as a function of applied electric\n\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic representation of the\nCQDs in a Schottky diode structure with larger\nbottom dot (B) and smaller top dot (T) at high\nenough electric fields shows hole level\nresonances along with electron wave function\n(blue) symmetric (direct) and anti symmetric\n(indirect) hole wave functions (red).

At high electric fields, the hole levels\nbecome resonant leading to enhancement of the symmetric and anti symmetric molecular hole\nwave functions. Away from the anticrossing region the holes can be predominantly localized on\neither the top or bottom dot leading to indirect or direct excitonic states respectively (Figure 1).\nWe represent the state of the CQD using\n\n\u239b eB\n\u239c\n\u239c hB\n\u239d\n\neT \u239e\n\u239f\nhT \u239f ,\n\u23a0\n\nwhere the four terms denote the number of\n\nelectrons (e) and holes (h) in the top (T) and bottom (B). The underlined terms indicate which\nparticles contribute to the recombination. By using arrows we may also denote the spin\nstate of the charges,\n\n\u239b\u2191B\n\u239c\n\u239c\u21d3B\n\u239d\n\n\u2193T \u239e\n\u239f\n\u21d1 T \u239f\u23a0\n\nwith spin up or down electrons (holes) in the bottom dot\n\n\u2191 B , \u2193 B (\u21d3 B , \u21d1 B ) and in the top dot \u2191 T , \u2193 T (\u21d3 T , \u21d1 T ) .\nWe use polarization dependent PL to help identify the spin states and interactions\nassociated with different exitonic states in the CQD system. Circularly polarized laser excitation\nis used to couple to the spin states of the carriers as there is a relationship between photon\npolarization and electron, hole spin projection due to angular momentum conservation [12].\nPolarization dependent photoluminescence is accomplished by introducing linear polarizers and\nliquid crystal retarders to the basic PL experiment. Initially linear polarized light is created by\nsending the CW laser beam with 860 nm through the linear polarizer and the desired circular\npolarized light is generated using the liquid crystal retarder which excites the CQDs. By varying\nthe applied voltage given to the liquid crystal retarder, its retardance can be varied which is used\nto generate a phase shift of \u03bb/4 or 3\u03bb/4 to create \u03c3+ or \u03c3\u2212 circularly polarized light. After the\nrecombination process, to analyze the degree of circular polarization, the emitted light is sent\nthrough a second liquid crystal retarder to detect both \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212.\nThe degree of polarization is given by P = ( I + \u2212 I \u2212 ) /( I + + I \u2212 ) with I + ( I \u2212 )\nrepresenting intensity of \u03c3+ (\u03c3\u2212) polarization under \u03c3+ polarized excitation. In the absence of\nexchange interaction we would anticipate 100 % degree of circular polarization, but in reality we\nobserve different polarization memory values associated with different charge and spin\nconfigurations of the excitons which is a direct result of the exchange interaction.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nPolarization dependent photoluminescence spectra for the three different charge states\nreveal that the neutral exciton has vanishingly small circular polarization memory, while the\npositive trion and the negative trion retain much of their circularly polarization memory. Similar\nresults have been observed in SQDs and understood as arising from the anisotropic exchange\ninteraction [13,14]. In the case of neutral exciton, the electron and a hole experience a strong\nanisotropic exchange interaction resulting in the circular polarization memory being wiped out.\nWhereas, in the case of the positive trion which has two holes and one electron, the ground state\nhole spins must form a spin singlet resulting in a zero total spin, cancelling out the exchange\ninteraction. Therefore the unpaired electron spin uniquely determines the polarization of the\nemission which is observed to be positive implying that the electron spin has largely retained its\ninitial spin. Similarly for the negative trion with two paired electrons and a hole, the degree of\npolarization is determined by the spin of the hole since the total electron spin is zero.\nIn the previous discussion it was shown that the effects of the anisotropic exchange\ninteraction can be mitigated by the elimination of the overall spin. In the CQD system we also\n\n\fhave the ability to spatially separate the electron and hole, providing another way to affect the\noverall exchange interaction. In CQDs we can tune the excitonic emission from intra-dot to\ninter-dot by simply tuning the electric field. As seen in Figure 1, by varying the electric field one\ncan tune from indirect to direct transition energy. This has the effect of shifting the wave\nfunction amplitude of the hole and therefore changing the overall electron-hole wave function\noverlap. From polarization dependent spectra (Figure 2), the direct transition demonstrates a\nweaker degree of circular polarization memory as it shows strong exchange interaction in its\ndirect configuration, whereas the indirect transition shows a relatively higher degree of circular\npolarization memory due to the reduced exchange interaction. Furthermore at the anticrossing\nregime which happens around the applied electric field of 53.96 kV/cm, the degree of\npolarization for both indirect and direct transitions tend to be almost the same. This is because\nour n-doped samples demonstrate hole level resonances and at this electric field the molecular\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric hole wave functions have comparable amplitude in both the top\nand bottom dots. This results in an increase in the polarization memory of the direct\nconfiguration of the neutral exciton and a reduction in the polarization memory in its indirect\nconfiguration. These results are experimentally observed for a 4nm barrier CQD sample as\nshown in Figure 2 with the indirect line shown by solid squares, and direct line by open squares.\nSince the anisotropic exchange interaction directly affects the degree of circular polarization\nmemory, by observing the variation in the degree of polarization we deduce that by tuning the\nelectric field we are able to change the overall electron-hole exchange interaction.\n\n\u239b 1 0\u239e\n\u239c 0 1\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239d\n\u239b 1 0\u239e\n\u239c 2 0\u239f\n\u239d\n\u23a0\n\u239b1 0 \u239e\n\u239c1 0 \u239f\n\u239d \u23a0\n\n\u239b1 0 \u239e\n\u239c1 1 \u239f\n\u239d \u23a0\n\u239b2\n\u239c1\n\u239d\n\n0\u239e\n0 \u239f\u23a0\n\nc\na\n\nFigure 2.

These experiments were performed using an n-doped coupled dot\nstructure with a 4 nm barrier between the top and bottom dot with CW excitation of 913 nm.\n\n\fWe also performed barrier dependent experiments using similar CQD structures with\nbarrier heights of 4 nm and 2 nm between the top and bottom dot respectively. All the\nexperimental parameters were kept constant for both samples in polarization memory\nmeasurements. Due to variations between CQDs we typically observe hole level anti crossing at\ndifferent electric fields. For the 2nm barrier CQDs we found the field at which the anticrossing\noccurred to be 43.38 kV/cm, and 53.96 kV/cm for the 4 nm barrier. To compare the two samples\nwe plot the polarization measurements at electric fields relative to the anticrossing point.\n\nPolarization Difference %\n\n35\n\n4 nm\n2 nm\n\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\nFigure 3.

In general we observe an increase in the polarization memory as the electric\nfield is lowered with respect to the anticrossing. Further we observe that as the barrier increases\nthe degree of polarization increases as can be seen from the squares corresponding to 4 nm\nbarrier compared to the circles corresponding to the 2 nm barrier. This is due to the fact that as\nthe barrier between the top and the bottom dot is increased, the degree of overlap of the hole\nwave function with the electron wave function reduces.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe variation of the degree of polarization has been studied in the ground state of a\nneutral exciton in the InAs/GaAs CQD structure. Spectra from the direct and indirect\nconfigurations of the neutral exciton were analyzed for both circular polarizations. The low\ndegree of circular polarization memory in the direct configuration of the neutral exciton is a\nconsequence of the anisotropic exchange interaction. At lower electric fields the electron and the\nhole tend to spatially separate resulting in a reduction of the wave function overlap and hence the\nexchange interaction, which is observed as an increase in circular polarization memory. Further\nthe increase in barrier separation results in an enhancement of this effect. Therefore, for CQDs,\nan applied electric field can be used to tune between indirect and direct configurations to control\nthe degree of exchange interaction, providing a possible tool for spin manipulation.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank CMSS and NQPI for their financial support.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nD.
