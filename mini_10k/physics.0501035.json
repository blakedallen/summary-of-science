The trajectory of\nthe ion is given in Fig. 1. Expanding the trajectory about the resonance point,\nwe find that the magnitude of the impulses is given by\nB=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b1 cos(\u03c6c \u2212 12 yc t\u20322 )dt\u2032\n\n= \u03b1(2\u03c0/ |yc |)1/2 cos[\u03c6c \u2212 sign(yc )\u03c0/4],\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c6c = yc \u2212 \u03bdtc and tc and yc are the time and position of the wave-particle\n\"collision.\" We may determine the Larmor radius and phase of the ion at the end\nof the jth orbit [the beginning of the (j + 1)th orbit] in terms of these quantities\nat the beginning of the jth orbit. (Details are given in Ref. 1.) The resulting\ndifference equations are\nu = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c1,\n\nv = \u03b8 + \u03c1,\n\n(5a)\n\n\u03b8 = 21 (v + u),\n\n\u03c1 = 12 (v \u2212 u),\n\n(5b)\n\nuj+1 \u2212 uj = 2\u03c0\u03b4 \u2212 2\u03c0A cos vj ,\n\n(5c)\n\nvj+1 \u2212 vj = 2\u03c0\u03b4 + 2\u03c0A cos uj+1 ,\n\n(5d)\n\nwhere\n\u03b8 = \u03bdt\n\n(mod 2\u03c0),\n\n\u03c1 = (r2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )1/2 \u2212 \u03bd cos\u22121 (\u03bd/r) + \u03bd\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0/4,\nA=\n\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\u03b1\u03bd(r2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )1/4\n2\n,\n\u03c0\nr2\n\n\u03b4 = \u03bd \u2212 n.\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nHere r is the normalized Larmor radius, k\u22a5 v\u22a5 /\u03a9i , and n is an integer. The limits\nof validity of (5) are\n\u03bd \u226b 1,\n\nr \u2212 \u03bd \u226b ( 12 \u03bd)1/3 ,\n\nA \u226a (r2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )3/2 /r2 .\n\n(8)\n\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the trajectories obtained using the exact equations of\nmotion, (2), with those obtained from the difference equations, (5). We see that\nthe agreement is very good indicating that (5) is an excellent approximation of\n(2).\nThere are three advantages to using the difference equations in preference\nto the Lorentz force law. Firstly, they are much quicker to solve numerically.\nSecondly, because of the way the equations were derived, the results are easier\nto interpret. Lastly, the equations have separated out two velocity-space scales,\nthe \u03c1 scale (\u223c \u03a9i /k\u22a5 ) and the r scale (\u223c \u03c9/k\u22a5 ). We therefore treat A which\nis a function of r as a constant when iterating the equations. This means that\nthe diffusion coefficient is independent of \u03c1 and so is much easier to determine\nnumerically.\nExamples of Trajectories\nWhen A is infinitesimal, (5) may be solved by integrating (summing?) over\nunperturbed orbits. Substituting uj = u0 + 2\u03c0\u03b4j and vj = v0 + 2\u03c0\u03b4j into the\nright hand sides of (5c) and (5d) gives\n\u03c1N \u2212 \u03c10 = 2\u03c0A cos(\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c0\u03b4)\n\uf8f1\n\u03b4\n\uf8f4\nfor \u03b4 = integer,\n\uf8f2(\u22121) cos \u03b80 N,\n\u00d7 sin(2\u03c0\u03b4N + \u03b80 ) \u2212 sin \u03b80\n\uf8f4\n, for \u03b4 6= integer.\n\uf8f3\n2 sin(\u03c0\u03b4)\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the trajectory is secular or not depending on whether or not \u03b4 is\nan integer (\u03c9 is a cyclotron harmonic). Formally, we may compute a diffusion\ncoefficient using\nh(\u03c1N \u2212 \u03c10 )2 i\nD = Lim\n.\n(10)\nN \u2192\u221e\n2N\nSubstituting (9) into (10) gives\nD = \u03c0 2 A2 cos2 \u03c10\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b4\u0302(\u03b4 \u2212 m),\n\n(11)\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03b4\u0302 is the Dirac delta function. Converting back to r and t and undoing the\nnormalizations gives\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132 X\n\u0013\n\u221e\n\u03c9\n\u03c0 qi2 E02\nk\u22a5 v\u22a5\n2\nD=\n\u03b4\u0302(\u03c9 \u2212 m\u03a9i ),\n(12)\nJ\nm\n2 m2i\nk\u22a5 v\u22a5\n\u03a9i\nm=\u2212\u221e\nwhich is the usual quasi-linear diffusion coefficient.\nIf we consider finite but small A, then all the trajectories are bounded. There\nare three distinct cases, \u03b4 = 0 (which is the case considered by Fukuyama et al.2 ),\n\u03b4 = 12 , and \u03b4 6= 0 or 21 . The trajectories for these cases are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nWhen A is increased, the system undergoes a stochastic transition, an example of which is shown in Fig. 4 for \u03b4 = 0.23. Below the stochasticity threshold,\nnearly all the trajectories are integrable [Fig. 4(a)] or, if there are stochastic trajectories, they are bounded in \u03c1 [Fig. 4(b)]. Above the threshold, nearly all the\ntrajectories are stochastic and unbounded. The value of the threshold may be\nnumerically determined and is found to be A = As = 14 . Above this value of A,\nthe kick received by the ion during one transit through resonance is sufficient to\nchange the phase of the kick received when next in resonance by \u03c0/2.\nDiffusion Coefficient\nWhen computing the diffusion coefficient numerically, it is convenient to\nwork with the correlation function, Ck , where\nCk = haj aj+k i,\n\n(13)\n\naj is the particle acceleration, aj = \u03c1j+1 \u2212\u03c1j , and the average is over an ensemble\nof particles and over the length of a given trajectory (i.e., over j). Then the\ndiffusion coefficient, D, is given by\n\u221e\n\nD=\n\nX\n1\nC0 +\nCk .\n2\n\n(14)\n\nk=1\n\n[This definition is equivalent to (10).] The advantages of defining D in this way\nare twofold. Firstly, the statistical fluctuations in the computation are minimized.\nSecondly, it is easy to introduce the effects of collisions on the diffusion coefficient.\nThis is accomplished as follows: If k0 is the mean number of cyclotron periods\nbetween decorrelating collisions (such collisions need only result in deflection by\n1/\u03bd, a small angle), then the probability of such a collision taking place in k\nperiods is 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212k/k0 ) since collisions are independent events. Collisions\nmay then be included in the computations of D by replacing Ck in (14) by\nCk exp(\u2212k/k0 ).\nIn the limit A \u226b As , the kicks the ion receives are uncorrelated so that only\nC0 is nonzero. Assuming that the trajectory is ergodic, we obtain D = 21 \u03c0 2 A2 .\nWhen A is not large, we account for the correlations between the kicks received\nby the ion by writing\n(15)\nD = 21 \u03c0 2 A2 g 2 (A),\nNumerically determining g(A) we find that approximately\ng(A) = max(1 \u2212 A2s /A2 , 0),\n\n(16)\n\n1\n4.\n\nwith As =\nConverting (15) back into usual variables we obtain\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 qi2 E02\ng 2 (A)\n\u03c9\nD=\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2 mi\nk\u22a5 v\u22a5 (k\u22a5 v\u22a5 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )1/2\n\n(17)\n\nIn the limit A \u226b As , when g(A) \u2248 1, this is just the zero-magnetic-field result,\n(\u03c0/2)(qi /mi )2 E02 \u03b4\u0302(\u03c9 \u2212 k\u22a5 vy ), averaged over Larmor phase. Thus, in this limit,\nwe recover ion Landau damping.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nExtension to Parallel Propagation\nThe diffusion coefficient was so easily calculated above because of the simplification obtained by reducing the problem to difference equations, (5). This\nreduction may be achieved in similar problems. We consider here the case where\nthe wave has some component of parallel propagation so that (1) becomes\nE = E0 (\u0177 + kk \u1e91/k\u22a5 ) cos(k\u22a5 y + kk z \u2212 \u03c9t).\n\nB = B0 \u1e91,\n\n(18)\n\nAdopting the same normalization as before, we obtain\n\u00ff + y = \u03b1 cos(y + \u03b6z \u2212 \u03bdt),\nz\u0308 = \u03b1\u03b6 cos(y + \u03b6z \u2212 \u03bdt),\n\n(19a)\n(19b)\n\nwhere \u03b6 = kk /k\u22a5 . The difference equations for a particle with normalized Larmor\nradius, r, and normalized parallel velocity, w = k\u22a5 vk /\u03a9i , are\nu = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c1,\n\nv = \u03b8 + \u03c1,\n\n(20a)\n\nuj+1 \u2212 uj = 2\u03c0\u03b3j+1/2 \u2212 2\u03c0A cos vj ,\n\n(20b)\n\nvj+1 \u2212 vj = 2\u03c0\u03b3j+1/2 + 2\u03c0A cos uj+1 ,\n\n(20c)\n\n\u03b3j+1/2 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2(\u03c1j + \u03c0A cos vj ),\n\n(20d)\n\nwhere the variables \u03b8 and \u03c1 are given by\n\u03b8 = \u03bdt \u2212 \u03b6z\n\n(mod 2\u03c0),\n\n(21a)\n\n\u03c1 = (r2 \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/2 \u2212 \u03bc cos\u22121 (\u03bc/r) + \u03bc\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0/4 \u2212 2\u03c0m.\n\n(21b)\n\nThe definitions of the parameters A, \u03b2, and \u03c1 are\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n2\n\u03b1\u03bcQ\n,\nA=\n2\n\u03c0\nr(r \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/4\n\n(22a)\n\n\u03b2 = \u03b6 2 r/(\u03bcQ),\n\n(22b)\n\n\u03b4 = \u03bc + \u03b2\u03c1 \u2212 n.\n\n(22c)\n\nHere, m and n are integers and\n\u03bc = \u03bd \u2212 \u03b6w,\nQ=\n\n(23a)\n\n\u0010 \u03bc \u0011i \u03b6 2 r\n(r2 \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/2 h\n\u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 cos\u22121\n.\nr\nr\n\u03bc\n\n(23b)\n\nDespite appearances \u03b4 is a parameter independent of \u03c1 since the quantity \u03bc + \u03b2\u03c1\nis a constant. (This follows from energy conservation in the wave frame.) The\nrestrictions on the validity of (20) are\n\u03bc \u226b 1,\n\nr \u2212 \u03bc \u226b ( 12 \u03bc)1/3 .\n\n(24)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nA comparison between the exact equations of motion, (19), and the difference\nequations, (20), is shown in Fig. 5 for \u03b6 = 1 (propagation at 45\u25e6 ). Again, there\nis excellent agreement.\nThe results of Smith and Kaufman3 may be obtained in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e\nand A \u2192 0 (Q \u2192 0). In that case, the change in \u03c1 is negligible so that it is\nnecessary to rescale the velocity variable by defining\n\u03c3j = 4\u03c0\u03b2\u03c1j \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b4.\n\n(25)\n\n\u03b8j+1 \u2212 \u03b8j = \u2212\u03c3j \u2212 21 K cos(\u03b8j + \u03c1),\n\n(26a)\n\n\u03c3j+1 \u2212 \u03c3j = 21 K[cos(\u03b8j+1 \u2212 \u03c1) + cos(\u03b8j + \u03c1)],\n\n(26b)\n\nEquation (20) then becomes\n\nwhere K = 4\u03c0 2 A\u03b2. In (26) \u03c1 is a constant. Setting\n\u03c8 = \u03c3 + 21 Kcos(\u03b8 + \u03c1)\n\n(27)\n\ngives\n\u03b8j+1 \u2212 \u03b8j = \u2212\u03c8j ,\n\n(28a)\n\n\u03c8j+1 \u2212 \u03c8j = K cos \u03c1 cos \u03b8j+1 .\n\n(28b)\n\nThis is the \"standard mapping\" studied by Chirikov.4 The island overlap condition for this mapping is |K cos \u03c1| > \u03c0 2 /4 or\n|\u03b1| > 16\u03b6 2 J\u03bc (r)\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich is the stochasticity threshold obtained by Smith and Kaufman. The island\noverlap criterion is a significant overestimate of the stochasticity threshold for the\nstandard mapping.4 Greene5 has calculated that the true threshold is a factor\n(\u03c0 2 /4)/0.971635 \u2248 2 21 smaller than the result given above.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to thank N.
