To be in line with\nstring theory, it is assumed that all the standard model\ndegrees of freedom reside on the brane where as gravity can propagate into bulk. In adherence to Newtonian\ngravity in the low energy limit, the bulk is assumed to\nbe anti de-Sitter allowing gravity to be localized near the\nbrane dynamically and thereby leading to Newton's law\nwith small corrections at large distances. The space time\ndynamics projected from the bulk to brane leads to the\nmodified Einstein equations on the brane. The resulting Hubble equation on the FRW brane ,among other\nthings, contains high energy corrections which have important implications for early universe physics. In particular, the prospects of inflation are enhanced in brane\n\n\u2217 On leave from: Department of Physics, Jamia Millia, New Delhi110025; Electronic address: sami@iucaa.ernet.in\n\u2020 Electronic address: savchenko@xray.sai.msu.ru\n\u2021 Electronic address: lesha@sai.msu.ru\n\nworld cosmology. In the case of standard FRW , the\nsteep potentials can not support inflation and bouncing solutions. The presence of the quadratic density\nterm (high energy corrections) in the Friedman equation on the brane changes the expansion dynamics at\nearly epochs [3](see Ref[4] for details on the dynamics\nof brane worlds). Consequently, the field experiences\ngreater damping and rolls down its potential slower than\nit would during the conventional inflation. Thus, inflation in the brane world scenario can successfully occur\nfor very steep potentials[5, 6]. The brane assisted inflation allows to build successful models of quintessential inflation[7]. However, the recent WMAP observations and large scale galaxy clustering studies severely\nconstraint the steep brane world inflation. For instance,\nthe inflation driven by steep exponential potential in RS\nscenario is excluded by observation for the number of efolds as large as 70[8]. It was recently shown that GaussBonnet (GB) correction in the bulk could rescue these\nmodels[9].\nThere is a sound theoretical reason to include the higher\ncurvature terms in Einstein-Hilbert action[10, 11]. These\nterms arise perturbatively as next to leading order correction in effective string theory action. The Gauss-Bonnet\ncombination is special in five dimensions as it is a unique\ninvariant which leads to field equations of second order\n\n\f2\nlinear in the highest derivative thereby ensuring a unique\nsolution[40].\nThe Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations projected on to\nthe brane lead to a complicated Hubble equation in\ngeneral[13, 14, 15, 16] (see also Ref[17]) . Interestingly, it reduces to a very simple equation H 2 \u223c \u03c1q\nwith q = 1, 2, 2/3 in limiting cases corresponding to\nGR, RS and GB regimes respectively. In the high energy GB regime, this allows to push the spectral index\nnS very close to one for exponential potential in case\nof ordinary scalar field [14]. The tachyonic inflation is\nrecently studied in patch cosmologies in view of observational constraints[30]. The patches corresponding to\nGR, RS and GB naturally arise in the dynamical history\ndescribed by the exact effective Hubble equation on the\nbrane in presence of the GB term in the bulk. It is really interesting to carry out the detailed investigations\nof tachyon field inflation in the full GB dynamics which\ngives rise to the mentioned patches at relevant energy\nscales. It is also important to investigate the behavior\nof scalar field near singularity and look for the scaling\nsolutions in the patch cosmologies.\nIn this paper we study different aspects of scalar field dynamics in brane worlds with GB term in the bulk. In section II, we review the basic concepts of GB brane world\ncosmology. In section III, we investigate the tachyon inflation in the GB background with polynomial type of\npotentials which corresponds to an exponential potential\nin a special case. This section includes the detailed description of tachyon field inflation at all the energy scales\nfrom GR to high energy GB regime.\nSection IV is devoted to the study of non-inflationary\ndynamics of ordinary scalar field in the background governed by the Friedmann equation H 2 \u223c \u03c1q . This section\ncontains the description of asymptotic behavior of scalar\nfield near singularity and the existence of scaling solutions in the background cosmology under consideration.\n\nII.\n\nGAUSS-BONNET BRANE WORLDS\n\nThe Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet action for five dimensional\nbulk containing a 4D brane is\nZ\n\u221a \b\n1\nd5 x \u2212g R \u2212 2\u039b5 + \u03b1[R2 \u2212 4RAB RAB\nS =\n2\n2\u03ba5\nZ\n\u221a\n+ RABCD RABCD ] + d4 x \u2212h(Lm \u2212 \u03bb) , (1)\nR refers to the Ricci scalar in the bulk metric gAB and\nhAB is the induced metric on the brane ; \u03b1 has dimensions of (length)2 and is the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while\n\u03bb is the brane tension and \u039b5 (< 0) is the bulk cosmological constant.

It was shown by Sen[19, 20]\nthat the decay of D-branes produces a pressure-less gas\nwith finite energy density that resembles classical dust.\nAttempts have been made to construct viable cosmological model using rolling tachyon field as a suitable candidate for inflaton, dark matter or dark energy[21]. As for\nthe inflation, the rolling tachyon models are faced with\ndifficulties related to the requirement of enough inflation\nand the right level of density perturbations. It seems to\nbe impossible to meet these requirements if we stick to\nstring theory tachyons. In what follows we shall consider\nthe tachyonic potentials in purely phenomenological context to obtain viable models of inflation. Unfortunately,\neven after this relaxation, the tachyonic models face difficulties associated with reheating[22] and the formation of\ncaustics/kinks[23] and we do not address these problem\nin this paper. We should, however, note that the model\nbased upon the rolling massive scalar field on D\u03043 brane\nis free from these difficulties[24], perhaps, except the formation of caustics, which requires further investigation\n[41].\nThe tachyonic field is described by the following action\n\u001a\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u221a\nR\n4\nS =\nd x\n\u2212g\n2\u03ba2\n\u001b\np\n(14)\n\u2212 V (\u03c6) \u2212 det(gab + \u2202a \u03c6\u2202b \u03c6) .\n\nIn a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) background, the energy momentum tensor which\nfollows from (14) for the Born-Infeld scalar \u03c6 acquires\nthe diagonal form T\u03bd\u03bc = diag (\u2212\u03c1, p, p, p).

As pointed out in Ref.[9], both \u01eb and \u03b7 exhibit a\npeculiarity for p = 6 (in case of ordinary scalar field inflation) in the region \u03c7 << 1: they are increasing functions\nof \u03c7 for p < 6 whereas the situation is reversed for p > 6.\nIt turns out that p = 6 case, also gets distinguished for\nlarge values of \u03c7, i.e, in the GB regime where the dynamics is described by a simple equation H 2 \u223c \u03c12/3 . Indeed,\nin region \u03c7 >> 1, the the slow roll parameters behave as\n\u01eb, \u03b7\n\n\u221d \u03c7(p\u22126)/3p\n\nwhich for p \u2192 \u221e reduces the expression for \u03c7e obtained\nin Ref[27]. for exponential potential.

(27) & (28) that in the GB regime,\nthe slow roll parameters exhibit a specific behavior in\ncase p = 6 for ordinary scalar field whereas the similar\nbehavior is realized for tachyon field if p = \u22123[25] (see\nRef.[26] which deals with similar problem in case of RS\nand standard GR). After a brief remark on the scalar\nfield dynamic in patch cosmology, we return to the full\ndynamics described by (2) & (3).

However, for particular values p \u00b1\n2, \u221e, the integral in (29) can be computed analytically.\nFor one of the values of interest p = 4, we shall opt for\nthe numerical computation of the integral.

In case of p = 4, we get complicated combinations of hyper-geometric functions; it is not very illuminating to produce theme in the text and we we have\nstudied this case numerically. We have ensured that the\nnumerics in case of p = \u00b12 and p = \u221e produces our\nanalytical results. In Figs. 1 & 2, we have plotted the\nslow roll parameters \u01eb and \u03b7 for three cases. We observe\nthat for large values of p, the slow roll parameter \u01eb has\nminimum in the intermediate region which increases and\napproaches a constant value as we move towards the GB\nregime (large values of \u03c7N ). The minimum becomes less\nand less pronounced for smaller values of p. The slow\nroll parameter \u03b7 \u2261 0 in case of the exponential potential,\nwhereas in other two cases, it represents a monotonically\nincreasing function of \u03c7N approaching a constant value\nin the GB regime (see Fig. 2). It is interesting to compare these features with GB inflation in case of ordinary\nscalar field. In the later case, the slow roll parameters are\nmonotonously increasing function of \u03c7N for large values\nof p in contrast to the GB tachyonic inflation where they\nassume a minimum value in the intermediate region and\nthen gradually approach a constant value. Secondly, numerical values of these parameters, at all energy scales\nand for \u2200p > 0, remain much smaller than their counter\nparts associated with ordinary scalar field GB inflation.\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n\f5\nThe amplitude of density perturbations in this case is\ngiven by[28]\n\n0.0085\n0.008\n0.0075\n\nA2S =\n\n0.007\n0.0065\n\n\u0012\n\nH2\n2\u03c0 2 \u03c6\u0307\n\n1\n,\nZS\n\n(38)\n\nwhere ZS \u2261 \u2212(f,X /2 + f,XX X) = V (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 )\u22123/2 .

It would really be\ninteresting to compare this situation with the standard\ninflationary scenario in presence of the GB correction in\nthe bulk. In this case, the spectral index shows a very\ndifferent behavior relative to the tachyonic GB inflation\nfor exponential potential. It monotonously increases and\napproaches 1 for large \u03c7N [14]. Actually, the exponential potential is special to ordinary GB inflation which is\nrelated to the fact that scale invariance is exact in this\ncase if the background dynamics is governed by the Hubble equation H 2 \u223c \u03c12/3 [14]. And this is certainly not true\nfor tachyon field as it is governed by different dynamics.\nInterestingly, exact scaling for tachyon GB inflation is\nrealized by a field potential very different from the exponential function.

(50) is valid in the\nasymptotic regimes \u03c7N << 1 (RS \u2212 regime) and \u03c7N >>\n1 (GB \u2212 regime). For scale invariance of spectrum, the\n(RHS) of (50) should vanish leading to the simple relation\np=\u2212\n\n4\n,\nq(4 + \u03b8)\n\n(51)\n\nwhich gives rise to p = \u22122 for GB patch (q = 2/3) and\np = \u22122/5 in case of RS patch (q = 2), in agreement\nwith the result obtained in[30]. Here we have taken into\naccount that \u03b8(\u03c7) \u2192 \u00b11 in the limits of \u03c7N << 1 and\n\u03c7N >> 1 respectively. Our treatment of the full dynamics confirms this feature in the high energy GB regime\n(see, Fig.6).\nWe have also considered models corresponding to larger\ninverse powers than the inverse square potential. We find\nthat the numerical values of nS for p \u2264 \u22123 are lower as\ncompared to the case of an exponential potential (Fig.\n7) and approach the later in the limit of large negative\np. The crossing takes place for p > \u22123 allowing the scale\ninvariant limit to be reached for p = \u22122.\nD.\n\nTensor to Scalar Ratio of Perturbations R\n\nThe behavior of the tensor to scalar ratio of perturbations is dictated by the features possessed by the functions D(\u03c7N ) and nS . The ratio R is plotted in Fig. 8.\n\n\f7\n\n\u03b13 \u03bb\n> 48 sinh6 (\u03c7N )\n\u03ba24\n\n(52)\n\nUsing Eqs. (39), (32) & (33) along with COBE normalized value of density perturbations, we can express\n\u03b13 \u03bb/\u03ba24 , entirely, as a function of energy scale \u03c7N and\nthe number of e-folds N . The constraint (52), then leads\nto an upper bound on the variable \u03c7N . In case of ordinary scalar field GB inflation, it was very important to\nfind these bounds as the tensor to scalar ratio R, in general, is a monotonously increasing function of \u03c7N which\nbecomes large in high energy GB regime. In our case,\nas mentioned above, the ratio remains very low for all\nvalues of \u03c7N in case of any generic positive value of p.\nHowever, it is true that it makes sense to consider only\nthose values of the energy scale which are consistent with\n(52). The upper bounds on \u03c7N in our model lies between\n6 & 7 in these cases.\n\nIV.\n\nISSUES OF SCALAR FIELD DYNAMICS IN\nH 2 \u223c \u03c1q COSMOLOGY\n\nSo far, three particular models of the form H 2 \u223c \u03c1q\nhave been considered in the literature. These include:\nstandard cosmology(q = 1), the Randall-Sundrum brane\n\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n\nZ(\u03c7)\n\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03c7N\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Evolution of function Z = Q (dotted line), G (dashed\nline), D (solid line) with the energy scale \u03c7N . The degeneracy\nfactor Q evolves from 1 to 2 as \u03c7N varies from RS (\u03c7N << 1)\nto GB regime, \u03c7N >> 1 (Q = 1 in the standard GR case\ncorresponding to \u03b2 = 0). G interpolates between 2 and 1, it\nexpresses the variation of the ratio nT /\u01eb as the energy scale\nchanges from lower to higher values.The function D peaks\naround the RS regime and tends to a constant value for large\n\u03c7N .\n0.985\n\n0.98\n\n0.975\n\nnS\n\nThe function R peaks around the RS regime which subsequently decreases to minimum and increases thereafter\napproaching a constant value in the GB regime. This is a\nvery important feature of GB inflation common to both\ntachyonic as well as non-tachyonic models. The RS value\nof the ratio R is generally larger relative to the case of\nGR[30]. The minimum of the function R is attributed\nto the fact that while passing from RS regime characterized by H 2 \u223c \u03c12 to the high energy GB limit with\nH 2 \u223c \u03c12/3 , there is an intermediate region which mimics the GR like behavior. In case of lower values of p,\nthe minimum of R is not distinguished. The numerical\nvalues of R as a function of \u03c7N are generally smaller for\nless steeper potentials. We find that the tensor to scalar\nratio of perturbations is very low for all the values of the\nexponent p > 0 at all the energy scales thereby providing\nsupport to the recent analysis of Ref.[30] in the limiting\ncases. The tachyonic model of inflation with polynomial\ntype of potentials is within the 1\u03c3 contour bonds at all\nenergy scales for p > 0 (see Fig. 10 and the observational\ncontours given in Ref.[9]; also see Ref[32] on the related\ntheme). In case of the run away potentials for small negative values of p, the tensor to scalar ratio becomes large\nfor large values of \u03c7N and it is suppressed in the intermediate region (Fig. 9). Thus, there is a possibility for these\nmodels to be consistent with observation in the intermediate region between RS and GB which is analogous to\nordinary scalar field GB inflation with steep potentials[9].\nFinally, we should remark that the dimensionless density\nscale can not increase indefinitely, it is restricted by the\n\u22128/3\nquantum gravity limit which corresponds to \u03c1 < \u03ba5\n\n0.97\n\n0.965\n\n0.96\n\n0.955\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03c7N\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: Plot of the spectral index nS versus the dimensionless\nenergy scale \u03c7N for the number of e-folds N = 60.

It is\nknown that in the standard case the scalar field diverges\nnear a singularity [33] while it remains finite in the brane\nworld [31]. We shall consider the behavior of scalar field\n\nin the background described by H 2 \u223c \u03c1q gives H \u223c \u03c6\u0307q\nwhich leads to\n\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c6\u03071+q = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nEq.

We observe\nthat the standard cosmology, q = 1 (in this case we can\nnot use (55) for which the asymptotic has the known form\n\u03c6 \u223c ln(t/t0 )), is an exceptional case which divides all\npossible asymptotic in two classes. For q < 1 both \u03c6 and\n\u03c6\u0307 diverge near a cosmological singularity. The GB\n\u221a brane\nbelongs to this class with the asymptotic \u03c6 \u2192 1/ t \u2212 t0 .\nOn the contrary, q > 1 leads to nonsingular \u03c6 and singular \u03c6\u0307 (\u03c6\u0307 can not be nonsingular because the power index\nin (55) is always less then unity). The well known example of this dynamics\n\u221a is provided by the Randall-Sundrum\nbrane with \u03c6 \u2192 t \u2212 t0 .\nIt is known that in the standard case the scalar field\npotential V (\u03c6) is not important during the cosmological\ncollapse unless it is steeper than exponent (see [34] for\ndetail). In the general case the role of potential depends\non the sign of q \u2212 1. For q > 1 the asymptotic \u03c6 \u2192 const,\n\u03c6\u0307 \u2192 \u221e prevents the potential from plying an important\nrole in the cosmological collapse. If q < 1, however, steep\nenough potential would destroy the regime (55).

By scaling solution we mean the\nsituation in which the scalar field energy density scales\nexactly as the power of the scale factor, \u03c1\u03c6 \u223c a\u2212n , while\nthe energy density of the perfect fluid (with equation of\nstate pm = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1m ), being the dominant component,\nscales as a (possible) different power, \u03c1m \u223c a\u2212m , m = 3\u03b3.\nWe will follow the method of Refs.[35] and[37] (see also\nRef.[36] on the related theme), where scaling solutions\nhave been found in the standard and brane cosmology.\n1.\n\nStandard scalar field\n\nSupposing that the scalar field energy density behaves\nas \u03c1\u03c6 \u223c a\u2212n , then using the Klein\u2013Gordon equation\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0,\n\n(58)\n\n\u03c6\u03072 /2\nn\n= .\n\u03c1\u03c6\n6\n\n2\nb=\n.\n1\u2212q\n\n(59)\n\n(62)\n\nIn case of matter dominance we have\na(t) \u223c t qm .\n\n(63)\n\nThen using Eqs.

On the other hand, if q > 1,\nthen there exists no scaling solutions for the matter with\nm > 6/q, or, equivalently, \u03b3 > 2/q. On the RandallSundrum brane, scaling solutions with \u03b2 > 0 are absent\nif m > 3 [37].\nWe summarize our results in the following table\n\n\u03b2<0\n\nq<1\nexists for all \u03b2\n\n\u03b2 > 0 exists \u2200 m, but \u03b2 >\n\nq>1\nexists only for \u03b2 <\n\n6+qm\n2 6\u2212qm\n\n(74)\n\nWe now discuss some consequences of (73,74).

First of all, positivity of the potential (67) requires\n6 \u2212 qm\n1\n<\n,\n\u03b2\n12\n\nbeen the equation of state of ordinary matter, the value\nfor m is bounded in the interval m \u2208 [0, 6]. Due to an\nadditional degree of freedom, we have more complicated\nsituation than one discussed in [35, 37]. To describe it\nin details, it would be convenient to discuss two cases \u2212\nfor positive and negative \u03b2 \u2212 separately.\nThe case of \u03b2 < 0\nThe stability condition (74) gives no further restrictions\nto the condition for existence of scaling solutions\n6 + qm\n\u03b2<2\n(75)\n6 \u2212 qm\nThey exist for\n12\n.\n(76)\n\u03b2<\n6 \u2212 qm\nFrom this equation one can see that for q \u2264 1 regardless\nthe value of m, we always have scaling solution. The standard cosmology and Gauss-Bonnet brane belong to this\nclass. For q > 1 the denominator in (76) can be negative,\nrestricting the range of \u03b2 suitably for the scaling solution.\nA known example is the Randall-Sundrum brane (q = 2),\nwhere the scaling solutions exist for \u03b2 < 6/(3 \u2212 m) [37].\nThe case of \u03b2 > 0\nIn this case one can rewrite (73) as follows\n12\n.\n(77)\n\u03b2>\n6 \u2212 qm\n\n\u03c6 \u223c t1\u2212 qm .\n\n(79)\n\nThe eq. (69) gives also the following. Consider first the\ncase of \u03b2 < 0. For q \u2264 1 the numerator is always less then\nthe denominator. It means that the scalar field energy\ndensity always drops less rapidly then the matter density.\nFor q > 1 it happens only if \u03b2 > 2/(\u03b1 \u2212 1). On the other\nhand, if \u03b2 > 0 and q \u2265 1, field energy density scales faster\nthen matter. For q < 1 it happens if \u03b2 > 2/(1 \u2212 q), i.e.\nfor power-law potentials which can not support inflation.\n\n\f11\n2.\n\nTachyon field\n\nWe would now investigate the existence of tachyon field\nscaling solution for matter dominance in the general cosmological background described by H 2 \u223c \u03c1q .

Our\nresult is in agreement with Ref.[38] which investigates\nthe scaling solutions in case of standard GR (q = 1).\nIn general, our findings for tachyon field are consistent\nwith the results of Ref.[39] which provides a unified frame\nwork to investigate the scaling solutions for a variety of\ndynamical systems.\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 )\n,\n\u03c60 (\u03c4 )\n\np(\u03c4 ) = u\u2032 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(85)\n\nwhere \u03c60 (\u03c4 ) is the exact solution given by (81).

We\nhave presented detailed investigation of tachyon inflation\nin GB background. Our analysis is quite general and\ndeals with tachyon field dynamics at all energy scales\nfrom GR to GB regimes for polynomial type of potentials. The information of GB correction is encoded in\nthe functions D, \u03b8 and the slow roll parameters. We find\nthat the spectral index reaches a maximum value in the\nintermediate region between RS and GB regimes which\nimproves for lower values of the exponent in case of positive p. Our analytical results and numerical treatment of\nthe full GB dynamics show that tachyonic inflation with\ninverse square potential leads to scale invariant spectrum\nin the high energy GB limit which is in agreement with\nthe asymptotic analysis of Ref.[30]. The combined effect of GB term on the tensor to scalar ratio, encoded\nin D(\u03c7), \u03b8(\u03c7) and the slow roll parameters, is such that\nR peaks around the RS regime and exhibits a minimum\nin the intermediate region. While evolving the energy\nscales from RS to high energy GB patch, the background\ndynamics gradually changes from H 2 \u223c \u03c12 to H 2 \u223c \u03c12/3\nmimicking the GR like features (H 2 \u223c \u03c1) in the intermediate region. This is an important property of GB correction which manifests in both tachyonic and standard\nscalar field dynamics. We have shown that the tensor to\nscalar ratio is generally very low in case of GB tachyonic\ninflation at all energy scales for polynomial type of potentials with generic positive values of p. We find similar\nfeatures in case inflation is driven by inverse power law\npotentials with large negative powers. When p is close\nto the scale invariant limit , the tensor to scalar ratio becomes large in the high energy GB regime whereas it is\nsuppressed in the intermediate region making these models consistent with observation.\nIn section IV, we have examined the generalized dynamics with Friedmann equation H 2 \u223c \u03c1q for an arbitrary\nq. This allowed us to explain some known differences\nbetween the standard cosmology (q = 1) and a RandallSundrum brane (q = 2) in the framework of a unified picture as well as to obtain new results in the case of GaussBonnet brane (q = 2/3). In the generalized background\ncosmology, we have investigated the asymptotic behavior\nof scalar field near cosmological singularity and studied\nscaling solutions in the regime when a perfect fluid energy\ndensity dominates. In the case of ordinary scalar field, we\n\n\f12\nhave demonstrated that the underlying field dynamics exhibits distinct features depending whether q < 1 or q > 1\nwhich, in particular, distinguishes the Gauss-Bonnet and\nRandall-Sundrum brane worlds. For tachyon system, we\nhave shown that the existence of stable scaling solutions\n\u2200 q is guaranteed if the adiabatic index of barotropic fluid\n\u03b3 < 1.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Gianluca Calcagni and Shinji Tsujikawa for\ntheir critical comments and for pointing out the reason\nfor the mismatch we had with their recent work in the\nasymptotic regime.

The GB term may be thought of as\nthe lowest-order stringy correction to the 5D EinsteinHilbert action, with coupling constant \u03b1 > 0. In this\ncase, \u03b1|R2 | \u226a |R|, so that\n\u03b1 \u226a l2 ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere l is the bulk curvature scale, |R| \u223c l\u22122 . The\nRS type models are recovered for \u03b1 = 0. The 5D field\nequations following from the bulk action are\n\u03b1\n(A2)\nGab = \u2212\u039b5 (5)gab + Hab ,\n2\n\u0003\n\u0002 2\nHab = R \u2212 4Rcd Rcd + Rcdef Rcdef (5)gab\n\u2212 4 [RRab \u2212 2Rac Rc b\n\u0003\n\u2212 2Racbd Rcd + Racde Rb cde .\n(A3)\n\nAn AdS5 bulk satisfies the 5D field equations, with\ni\n1 h\nR\u0304abcd = \u2212 2 (5)\u1e21ac (5)\u1e21bd \u2212 (5)\u1e21ad (5)\u1e21bc , (A4)\nl\n6 (5)\n\u03b1\n\u1e20ab = 2 \u1e21ab = \u2212\u039b5 (5)\u1e21ab + H\u0304ab ,\n(A5)\nl\n2\n24\n(A6)\nH\u0304ab = 4 (5)\u1e21ab .\nl\nIt follows that\n12\u03b1\n6\n+ 4 ,\nl2\nl\"\n#\nr\n1\n4\n1\n2\n1 \u2212 1 + \u03b1\u039b5 ,\n\u2261 \u03bc =\nl2\n4\u03b1\n3\n\n\u039b5 = \u2212\n\n(A7)\n(A8)\n\nwhere we choose in Eq. (A8) the branch with an RS limit,\nand \u03bc is the energy scale associated with l. This reduces\nto the RS relation 1/l2 = \u2212\u039b5 /6 when \u03b1 = 0. Note that\nthere is an upper limit to the GB coupling from Eq. (A8):\n\u03b1<\n\nl2\n,\n4\n\n(A9)\n\nwhich in particular ensures that \u039b5 < 0.\nA Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) brane in an\nAdS5 bulk is a solution to the field and junction equations. The modified Friedman equation on the (spatially\nflat) brane is\np\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03ba25 (\u03c1 + \u03bb) = 2 H 2 + \u03bc2 3 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03bc2 + 8\u03b1H 2 . (A10)\nThis may be rewritten as\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n1\n2\u03c7\n2\n2\nH =\n(1 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03bc ) cosh\n\u2212 1 (A11)\n,\n4\u03b1\n3\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n2(1 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03bc2 )3\n2\nsinh \u03c7 ,\n(A12)\n\u03ba5 (\u03c1 + \u03bb) =\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03c7 is a dimensionless measure of the energy density.\nNote that the limit in Eq. (A9) is necessary for H 2 to be\nnon-negative.\nWhen \u03c1 = 0 = H in Eq. (A10) we recover the expression for the critical brane tension which achieves zero\ncosmological constant on the brane,\n\u03ba25 \u03bb = 2\u03bc(3 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03bc2 ) .\n\n(A13)\n\nThe effective 4D Newton constant is given by\n\u03ba24 =\n\n\u03bc\n\u03ba2 .\n(1 + 4\u03b1\u03bc2 ) 5\n\n(A14)\n\nWhen Eq. (A1) holds, this implies M53 \u2248 M42 /l.\nThe modified Friedman equation (A11), together with\nEq. (A12), shows that there is a characteristic GB energy scale,\n\u0014\n\u00151/8\n2(1 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03bc2 )3\nMGB =\n,\n(A15)\n\u03b1\u03ba45\nsuch that the GB high energy regime (\u03c7 \u226b 1) is \u03c1 + \u03bb \u226b\n4\nMGB\n. If we consider the GB term in the action as a\ncorrection to RS gravity, then MGB is greater than the\nRS energy scale M\u03bb = \u03bb1/4 , which marks the transition\nto RS high-energy corrections to 4D general relativity.\nBy Eq. (A13), this requires 3\u03b2 3 \u2212 12\u03b2 2 + 15\u03b2 \u2212 2 < 0\nwhere \u03b2 \u2261 4\u03b1\u03bc2 . Thus (to 2 significant figures),\nM\u03bb < MGB \u21d2 \u03b1\u03bc2 < 0.038 ,\n\n(A16)\n\nwhich is consistent with Eq. (A1).\nExpanding Eq. (A11) in \u03c7, we find three regimes for\nthe dynamical history of the brane universe:\nthe GB regime,\n\u0014 2 \u00152/3\n\u03ba5\n4\n2\n\u03c1 \u226b MGB \u21d2 H \u2248\n\u03c1\n,\n(A17)\n16\u03b1\n\n\f13\nComparing Eqs. (A22) and (A16), we also find that\n\nthe RS regime,\n4\nMGB\n\u226b \u03c1 \u226b \u03bb \u2261 M\u03bb4 \u21d2 H 2 \u2248\n\n\u03ba24 2\n\u03c1 ,\n6\u03bb\n\n(A18)\n\nthe 4D regime,\n\nl\u226b\n\n1\n,\n8\u03c0M5\n\n(A24)\n\nThe mass scales M5 and M4 are related\n\u03ba2\n\u03c1 \u226a \u03bb \u21d2 H2 \u2248 4 \u03c1 .\n3\n\n(A19)\n\nThe GB regime, when the GB term dominates gravity at\nthe highest energies, above the brane tension, can usefully be characterized as\nH 2 \u226b \u03b1\u22121 \u226b \u03bc2 , H 2 \u221d \u03c12/3 .\n\n(A20)\n\nThe brane energy density should be limited by the quantum gravity limit, \u03c1 < M54 , in the high-energy regime.\nBy Eq. (A17),\n\u03c1 < M54 \u21d2 H <\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0M5\n2\u03b1\n\n\u00131/3\n\n.\n\nM53 \u2243\n\nr\n\n4\u03c0 1/2\n\u03bb M4\n3\n\n(A25)\n\nSince the brane energy density is limited by quantum\ngravity limit , the dimensionless energy scale \u03c7 can not\nexceed certain maximum value \u03c7max . Using COBE normalized value of density perturbations we found \u03c7max \u2243\n6. As for the brane tension \u03bb, it is typically of the order\nof 10\u22125 M44 .\nEquations (A6) and (A12) allow to relate the scales M5\nand MGB\n4\nsinh(\u03c7max )\nM54 \u2243 MGB\n\n(A21)\n\n(A26)\n\nThe typical estimates for various scales are\n\n4\nIn addition, since \u03c1 \u226b MGB\n, we have\n\n(A23)\n\nM\u03bb \u2243 10\u22125 M4 , M5 \u2243 10\u22123 M4 , MGB \u2243 10\u22124 M4\n(A27)\nThese estimates are consistent with the bounds on various scales in the problem quoted above. We once again\nemphasize that we treat here GB term perturbatively\nsuch that the smooth limit to RS brane world exists.\n\n[1] L. Randall and R. Sundrum, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 4690\n(1999); L.

It arises naturally as higher order iteration of the self interaction of gravitational field which retains the quasi-linear second order character of the field\nequation. The physical realization of this iteration naturally requires a 5-dimensional space time[12].\n[41] We thank A Starobinsky for his comment on the problem\nof caustics formation.\n\n\f"}
