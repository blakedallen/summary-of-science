The number of known diffuse radio sources in clusters of\ngalaxies has grown in recent years, making it possible to derive statistical\nproperties of these sources and of the hosting clusters. We show that\ndiffuse sources are associated with X-ray luminous clusters which have\nundergone recent merger processes. The radio and X-ray structures are\noften similar, and correlations are found between radio and X-ray parameters. This is indication of a link between the diffuse relativistic and\nthermal plasma in clusters of galaxies.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is well established that an important component of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) in clusters and groups of galaxies is the hot gas, observed in X-rays and\ncharacterized by temperatures in the range \u223c5-10 keV, by a central density\nof \u223c10\u22123 cm\u22123 and by a density distribution approximated by a beta model\n(Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1981). In addition, magnetic fields are wide spread\nin clusters (e.g. Eilek 1999), as deduced by Rotation Measure arguments, and\nrelativistic electrons may be common (Sarazin & Lieu 1998). These two nonthermal components can be directly revealed in some clusters by the presence\nof diffuse extended radio sources, which are related to the intergalactic medium,\nrather than to a particular cluster galaxy. However, diffuse sources seem not to\nbe a general property of the IGM.\nThe importance of these sources is that they represent large scale features,\nwhich are related to other cluster properties in the optical and X-ray domain,\nand are thus directly connected to the cluster history and evolution. In this\npaper, the observational properties of diffuse cluster sources and of their host\nclusters are outlined. Intrinsic parameters are calculated with H0 = 50 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5.\n2.\n\nClassification and radio properties\n\nThe diffuse source Coma C in the Coma cluster (Fig. 1, left panel), discovered\n30 years ago (Willson 1970), is the prototypical example of a cluster radio halo.\nThe radio halo is located at the cluster center, it has a steep radio spectrum\n(\u03b1 \u223c 1.3) and is extended \u223c 1 Mpc (Giovannini et al. 1993). Another example\nof cluster-wide halo, associated with the cluster A 2255, is shown in the right\npanel of Fig. 1. An additional diffuse source, 1253+275, is detected at the Coma\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLuigina Feretti\n\n28 40\nCOMA C\n\n64 15\n\n20\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\n30\n\n10\n00\n1253+275\n27 50\n40\n30\n\n10\n05\n00\n\n63 55\n20\n10\n\n17 14 30\n12 59\n\n58\n\n57\n56\n55\n54\n53\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n52\n\n51\n\n00 30 00 30 00 30 00 30\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\nFigure 1.\nExamples of diffuse sources in clusters, after subtraction\nof the discrete sources.

This source and similar diffuse\nsources located in peripheral cluster regions are referred to as radio relics in the\nliterature. This name may be misleading, since it can also be used to indicate\ndying radio galaxies, without active nucleus, as B2 1610+29 in A 2162 (Parma\net al. 1986). I would suggest peripheral halos, whereas Ron Ekers suggested\nradio flotsam. Since the interpretation of these sources is still unclear, I will use\nhere the name relics, for homogeneity with the literature.\nRadio halos and relics show low surface brightness (\u223c \u03bcJy/arcsec2 at 20 cm)\nand steep radio spectrum. Their detection is limited by the surface brightness\nsensitivity coupled with the high resolution needed to separate such sources from\nthe embedded discrete sources. Because of their steep spectrum, they are better\ndetected at lower frequencies.\nUntil recently, the number of halos and relics was small, thus these sources\nwere considered to be rare. This is no longer true. Thanks to the better sensitivity of radio telescopes and to the existence of deep surveys, more than 30\nclusters hosting diffuse sources are known today. For 18 of them (see Table 1)\nthe presence of diffuse radio emission is well established and good radio data are\navailable either from the literature or from new observations (Govoni et al. in\npreparation). It is remarkable the existence in some clusters of more than one\ndiffuse source.\n\n\fObservational Properties of Diffuse Halos in Clusters\n\nTable 1.\nCluster\n\n3\n\nClusters with well studied halos and relics\nz\nP1.4\nL.S.\nLXbol\nT\nDist Class\n1023 W Hz\u22121 Mpc 1044 erg s\u22121 keV Mpc\nA85\n0.0555\n6.26\n0.48\n19.52\n5.1 0.54\nR\nA115\n0.1971\n255.5\n1.88\n31.09\n4.9 0.93\nR\nA520\n0.2030\n62.1\n1.08\n37.35\n8.5\nH\nA610\n0.0956\n7.65\n0.57\n0.71\nR\nA665\n0.1818\n66.5\n2.13\n41.72\n8.5\nH\nA773\n0.2170\n22.3\n0.83\n35.10\n8.6\nH\nA1300\n0.3071\n92.4\n0.58\n47.63\n10.5\nH\n92.4\n0.95\n47.63\n10.5 0.80\nR\nA1367\n0.0216\n0.71\n0.29\n2.87\n3.5 0.83\nR\nA1656\n0.0232\n15.0\n1.09\n20.42\n8.2\nH\n7.03\n1.17\n20.42\n8.2 2.72\nR\nA2163\n0.2080\n306.2\n2.60\n132.91\n14.2\nH\nA2218\n0.1710\n12.2\n0.52\n21.96\n6.9\nH\nA2255\n0.0809\n12.6\n1.23\n12.42\n5.4\nH\n3.51\n0.98\n12.42\n5.4 1.23\nR\nA2256\n0.0581\n4.48\n1.11\n18.39\n7.5 0.59\nR\n37.3\n1.19\n18.39\n7.5\nH\nA2319\n0.0555\n20.8\n1.41\n39.74\n9.7\nH\nA2744\n0.3080\n241.6\n1.81\n62.44\n11.0\nH\n74.3\n1.84\n62.44\n11.0 1.91\nR\nA3667\n0.0552\n323.1\n2.63\n22.70\n7\n2.45\nR\nCL0016+16 0.5545\n89.6\n1.11\n28.13\n8.2\nH\n1E0658-56\n0.296\n312.0\n1.96\n140\n14.5\nH\nCaption.

Peripheral relics are\nelongated in shape, and the distribution of their largest sizes is not statistically\ndifferent from that of halos on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.\nThe distribution of projected distances from the cluster center (Fig. 2)\ndemonstrates that the diffuse sources are not located at random positions in the\nclusters, i.e. central halos are likely to be really at the cluster center and not\nsimply projected onto it.\nRadio powers are of the order of 1024 -1025 W Hz\u22121 at 1.4 GHz. In a radio\nsize-radio power diagram, the diffuse radio sources follow the same correlation\nof the radio galaxies (e.g. Ledlow et al. 2000), lying in the upper part of the\nplot.\nMinimum energy densities in diffuse sources are between \u223c 5 10\u221214 and\n\u221213\n2 10\nerg cm\u22123 . This implies that the pressure of relativistic electrons is\nmuch lower than that of the thermal plasma. Equipartition magnetic fields are\nabout \u223c0.1-1\u03bcG. These values can be compared with independent estimates\nfrom Rotation Measure arguments and from Inverse Compton X-ray emission,\nto determine if these radio sources are at the equipartition.\n\n3.\n\nOccurrence\n\nTo derive the frequency of radio halos and relics we need systematic radio information on complete samples of clusters. Giovannini et al. (1999) used the\nNRAO Vla Sky Survey (NVSS) to search for diffuse sources associated with\nclusters of galaxies from the sample of Ebeling et al. (1996). This sample is\ncomplete down to an X-ray flux of 5 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in (0.1-2.4) keV, for\nredshifts <0.2 and for galactic latitude |b|>20\u25e6 . Moreover, it contains some\nclusters at higher redshift and at lower galactic latitude.\nThe total detection rate of clusters with halos + relics in the complete\nsample is of 5% to 10%, and the relative occurence of halos and relics is similar\n(taking into account the uncertain detections). The detection rate increases with\nthe X-ray luminosity (Giovannini et al. 2000), being of \u223c40% in clusters with\nX-ray luminosity larger than 1045 erg s\u22121 . In particular, the detection rate of\ncentral radio halos is more strongly dependent on the X-ray luminosity.\nThe clusters hosting a diffuse source have a significantly higher X-ray luminosity than clusters without a diffuse source (> 99.9% confidence level with\na KS test). The detection rate in the high redshift sample is fully consistent\nwith the previous results. These results are consistent with those of Owen et al.\n(1999).\n\n4.\n\nProperties of the host clusters\n\nAn important property derived in the previous section is that the clusters hosting\ndiffuse sources are more X-ray luminous and consequently they have a high\ntemperature and a large mass. Values larger than 1.5 1014 M\u2299 are found for\nthe total (gravitating) mass within 0.5 Mpc, with gas fraction ranging from 10%\nto 20%. This is consistent with the serendipitous detection of halos observed\n\n\f5\n\nObservational Properties of Diffuse Halos in Clusters\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nCore Radius (kpc)\n\nFigure 3.\nLeft panel: Distribution of X-ray core radii of clusters with\nhalos and relics.

This is confirmed\nby statistical studies, according to the following arguments:\n- X-ray images of clusters with halos and relics show the presence of substructures\nand distortions in the brightness distribution (Schuecker & B\u00f6hringer 1999),\nwhich can be interpreted as the result of subclumps interaction;\n- clusters with halos do not have a strong cooling flow (e.g. Feretti 1999). This is\nfurther indication that a cluster has undergone a recent merger, as cooling flow\nand irregular cluster structure tend to be anticorrelated (Buote & Tsai 1996)\nand a strong merger process is expected to disrupt a cooling flow (Peres et al.\n1998);\n- the X-ray core radii of clusters with halos/relics in Table 1 (see Fig. 3, left\npanel) are significantly larger (>99% level using a KS test) than those of clusters\nclassified as single/primary by Jones anf Forman (1999). According to the last\nauthors, the large core radius clusters are multiple systems in the process of\nmerging and hotter clusters tend to have larger core radii;\n- for the clusters of Table 1 with optical and X-ray information, the values of\nspectroscopic \u03b2 are on average larger than 1 (Fig 3, right panel), indicating the\npresence of substructure (Edge & Stewart, 1991);\n- clusters with halos and relics have larger distances to their next neighbours\ncompared to ordinary clusters with similar X-ray luminosity, i.e. similar cluster\nmass (Schuecker and B\u00f6hringer 1999). The fact that they appear more isolated\ngives additional support to the idea that recent merger events in halo clusters\nlead to a depletion of the nearest neighbours.\nIn conclusion, there seems to be convincing evidence that diffuse sources\nare preferentially associated with high X-ray luminosity clusters with mergers.\nTo our knowledge, however, not all the X-ray luminous merging clusters host a\ndiffuse source, but this point needs further investigation.\n\n\f6\n\nLuigina Feretti\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFigure 4.\nMonochromatic radio power versus cluster bolometric Xray luminosity for halos (left panel) and relics (right panel).\n\n10\nTemperature (keV)\n\n10\nTemperature (keV)\n\nFigure 5.\nMonochromatic radio power versus cluster temperature for\nhalos (left panel) and relics (right panel).\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFigure 6.\nRadio largest linear size versus cluster bolometric X-ray\nluminosity for halos (left panel) and relics (right panel).\n\n\fObservational Properties of Diffuse Halos in Clusters\n5.\n\n7\n\nLink between relativistic and thermal plasma\n\nRadio structures of halos show in many cases close similarity to the X-ray structures, suggesting a causal connection between the hot and relativistic plasma.\nAn example is given in Fig. 1 (right panel), which shows that the central radio\nhalo in A 2255 is elongated in the E-W direction as the X-ray gas. Other examples are the radio halos in A 665, A 1300, A 2218, A 2319 (see Feretti 1999 for\ncomments on individual clusters) and in 1E0658-56 (Liang 1999).\nThe correlation visible between the monochromatic radio power at 1.4 GHz\nand the bolometric X-ray luminosity for the clusters of Table 1 (Fig. 4) implies a\ncorrelation between radio power and cluster temperature (Fig. 5), also derived\nby Liang (1999). Since the cluster X-ray luminosity and mass are correlated\nas well as the temperature and mass, it follows that the halo radio power also\ncorrelates with mass. The correlations must be taken into account in model\nof radio halo formation. It is of particular interest to understand whether the\nformation of a diffuse source is affected by the high cluster temperature or by\nthe large cluster mass.\nA correlation seems to exist also between the largest radio size of diffuse\nsources and the cluster X-ray luminosity (Fig. 6), and goes in the direction of\nmore X-ray luminous clusters hosting larger diffuse sources. All the correlations\nare more evident for radio halos than for relics.\nAnother link between radio and X-ray is represented by the detection of\nhard X-ray emission produced by the IC scattering of relativistic electrons with\nthe microwave background photons. The hard X-ray emission detected in the\nComa cluster (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999) and in A 2256 (Fusco-Femiano et al.\n2000) has been interpreted in this way.\n6.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nIt is evident from the observational results that central halos are strictly related\nto the presence of recent mergers. The cluster merger can provide energy for\nthe electron reacceleration and magnetic field amplification. However, also the\nhigh X-ray luminosity is relevant for the formation of halos. This seems to imply\nthat the dynamical history of the cluster, i.e. the formation process of a massive\nhot cluster is crucial to trigger a halo. This scenario would explain why not all\nmerging clusters host a halo (at least 50% of clusters show mergers, Jones &\nForman 1999, while less than 5% of clusters show central halos).\nBrunetti et al. (2000) suggested a two-phase model, successfully applied\nto Coma C, which includes: i) a phase of injection of relativistic electrons in\nthe cluster volume from starburst galaxies, AGNs, and strong shocks during the\ncluster formation; ii) a phase of particle reacceleration by recent mergers. The\nBrunetti et al. model can be generalized to the other halos, and it would account\nfor the presence of halos in X-ray luminous clusters, since the hot massive clusters\nshould have had a more efficient injection phase.\nIt still debated if radio halos and relics have a common origin and evolution,\nor if they should be considered as different classes of sources. Several clusters\nhost both a central and a peripheral halo, thus favouring a common origin and\nnature. Peripheral relics, like halos, are associated with merging clusters. How-\n\n\f8\n\nLuigina Feretti\n\never, the clusters are less luminous in X-ray and the radio-X-ray correlations are\nweaker. A current hypothesis is that radio relics have a different nature, and\nmay be reaccelerated by shock waves of an ongoing merger event, or from shocks\nduring the structure formation of the Universe (Ensslin 2000).\nAcknowledgments.
