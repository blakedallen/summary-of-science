It\nis stressed that observed agreement can be considered as the additional argument\nin favour of correctness of the recent direct numerical calculations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe calculations of perturbative QED contributions to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moments a\u03bc usually attract special interest. It is supported by the\nfact that for this low-energy quantity the interplay between pure QED contributions, electroweak (EW) and strong interactions effects plays important\nrole. Moreover, the importance of taking into account strong interaction contributions to a\u03bc was clearly demonstrated by comparison of the most recent\nexperimental data for a\u03bc [1] with available theoretical predictions (for a review\nsee [2]). It reveals the appearance of definite, though not so clean, deviations\nof theoretical and experimental results. The existence of this deviation pushed\nahead the desire to improve the knowledge about high order QED corrections to\na\u03bc . As a result, the numerical calculations of the sum of 2958 most important\nfive-loop diagrams, which depends on m\u03bc /me -ratio, were recently performed [3]\nHere we concentrate ourselves on the comparison of the numerical results for\norder \u03b14 and \u03b15 contributions to a\u03bc , obtained in Refs. [4]- [9] from analytical\nhigh-loop contributions to the photon vacuum polarization function, with the\nexisting results of direct numerical calculations.\n2\n\nThe four-loop contributions\n\nThe renormalization group method plays an important role in the high-order\nperturbative calculations. As was shown in Ref. [10], the coefficients of the\nln(m\u03bc /me )-terms in the expression for the vacuum polarization insertions into\na\u03bc can be determined with the help of the renormalization group equations\nin the on-shell scheme. The general expression for the contributions to a\u03bc of\nthe diagrams with dressed by electron loops internal photon line in the muon\nvertex reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03b1 1\n\u2212y 2 m2\u03bc\n\u221e\na\u03bc =\n, \u03b1 \u2212 1]\n(1)\ndy(1 \u2212 y)[dR\n\u03c0 0\n1 \u2212 y m2e\na e-mail:\n\nkataev@ms2.inr.ac.ru\nin part by RFBR Grant N 05-01-00992\n\nb Supported\n\n\f\u22121\nwhere d\u221e\nis the asymptotic photon propagator.\nR (\u03b1, x) = [1 + (\u03b1/\u03c0)\u03a0(\u03b1, x)]\nTaking into account analytical expressions for the constant and logarithmic contributions to the photon vacuum polarization function in the on-shell scheme,\none can obtain the number of asymptotic expressions for the diagrams, contributing to a\u03bc . The coefficients for the photon vacuum polarization function\ncan be obtained using the renormalization group relations between QED \u03b2function in the on-shell scheme and QED \u03b2-function in the momentum subtractions scheme which is known in the literature as the \u03a8-function (see e.g. [11,12]).\nThe example of application of this formalism is the analytical calculation of the\nasymptotic limit of the subset of four-loop diagrams, which contain in the photon line of the external muon vertex three-loop photon vacuum polarization\ncontribution with two electron loops (Subset 1). The preliminary consideration of Ref. [4] (see [13]) was based on the application of analytical results for\nthe four-loop contributions to the \u03a8-function from the photon vacuum polarization diagram with three electron loops [14] (confirmed later on in [15]) and\nof the analogous four-loop corrections to the \u03b2-function in the on-shell scheme,\ntaken from Ref. [16]. These considerations gave the following numerical contribution to a\u03bc [13] (see also [4])\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u03b1\nme\n)]\n(2)\na\u03bc (Subset 1) = [0.923374... + O(\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\n\nwhich was in disagreement with the result of numerical calculations of Ref.

[5], this disagreement came from a theoretical error, which\nentered on-shell studies of Ref. [16]. It was corrected in Ref. [5] and the new\nasymptotic expression was obtained [4, 5]:\n\u0012 \u00134\nme\n\u03b1\n.\n(4)\n)]\na\u03bc (Subset 1) = [1.452570... + O(\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\nIt differs now from Eq.(3) in the third significant digit only. This discrepancy\ncan be explained by the existence in Eq.(4) of the O(m\u03bc /me )-corrections. The\nproblem of comparing four-loop asymptotic and numerical contributions to\na\u03bc appeared again in the process of consideration of the subset of diagrams,\ngenerated by the insertion into the internal photon line of the muon vertex\nthree-loop vacuum polarization graphs in the \"quenched\" approximation, which\ndo not contain internal loops. (Subset 2). Detailed calculational analysis of\nRef. [8] gave the following numerical expression:\n\u0012 \u00134\nme\n\u03b1\na\u03bc (Subset 2) = [\u22120.290987... + O(\n)]\n.\n(5)\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\n\n\fwhile the numerical results of Ref. [17] were\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u03b1\na\u03bc (Subset 2) = \u22120.7945(202)\n\u03c0\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThe disagreement was mostly removed in Ref. [18] after re-evaluating these diagrams using the integration VEGAS routine (the result of Eq.(6) was obtained\nusing the integration routine RIWIAD). It was explained in Ref. [18] that the\nnew number\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u03b1\na\u03bc (Subset 2) = \u22120.2415(19)\n(7)\n\u03c0\ndiffered from the one of Eq.(6) due to severe underestimation of errors, which\nappeared in the process of the calculations of Ref [17]. Moreover, it is closer\nto the asymptotic expression of Eq.(5), though definite difference of order\nO(me /m\u03bc ) still remained. This difference stimulated the authors of Ref. [9] to\nimprove the precision of Eq.(5), combining the asymptotic [19, 20] and threshold [21] results and applying the developed in Ref. [22] variant of the Pad\u00e9\nresummation technique. After these improvements Eq.(5) moved in the direction of numerical value of Eq.(7). Indeed, the delicate calculation of Ref. [9]\ngave\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u03b1\n.\n(8)\na\u03bc (Subset 2) = \u22120.230362(5)\n\u03c0\nFinally, in the work of Ref. [23] the following new result was obtained:\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u03b1\n.\n(9)\na\u03bc (Subset 2) = \u22120.230596(416)\n\u03c0\nIt is in perfect agreement with Eq.(8). The remaining difference between the\nresults of Eq.(9) and Eq.(7) was traced to a problem discovered in Ref. [23] of\nrounding-off errors caused by keeping an insufficient number of effective digits\nin carrying out renormalization by numerical means. Thus the discovered in\nRef. [8] discrepancy between the results of analytically-oriented and numerical\ncalculations was finally eliminated.\n3\n\nThe five-loop contributions\n\nThe calculations of the asymptotic contributions to a\u03bc from the diagrams\nwith single dressed internal photon line was continued at the five-loop level\nin Refs. [6]- [8]. In particular, Ref. [6] shows that the coefficient of the subset\nof diagrams with internal four-loop light-by-light scattering graphs, composed\nfrom diagrams with two electron loops ( Subset 3), is small\n\u0012 \u00135\n[2,l\u2212l]\nme\n\u03b1\na\n)]\n\u2212 2.0237 + O(\n(10)\na\u03bc (Subset 3) = [\u2212 4\n2\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\n\n\f[2,l\u2212l]\n\nwhere a4\nis the constant term of the logarithmically divergent sum of the\nfour-loop light-by-light scattering contributions to the photon vacuum polarization function. The subset of the five-loop contributions to a\u03bc , formed by\ninsertion into photon line of the sum of the four-loop \"quenched\" vacuum polarization graphs (Subset 4), gives the similar five-loop correction [7]\n\u0012 \u00135\n[1]\nme\n\u03b1\na\n(11)\n)]\na\u03bc (Subset 4) = [\u2212 4 \u2212 0.7334 + O(\n2\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\n[1]\n\nwhere a4 is the constant term of the sum of the four-loop \"quenched\" vacuum\npolarization diagrams. The contribution to a\u03bc from the five-loop diagrams\nof Subset 5, which is generated by inserting into photon line of the four-loop\nvacuum polarization graphs with two electron loops, also contain still unknown\nconstant terms [7]:\n\u0012 \u00135\n[2]\nme\n\u03b1\na\n.\n(12)\n)]\na\u03bc (Subset 5) = [\u2212 4 + 0.6642 + O(\n2\nm\u03bc\n\u03c0\nThe numerical calculations of the diagrams contributing to Eq.(10)-Eq.(12) are\nstill unavailable. However, there are subsets of five-loop diagrams contributing\nto a\u03bc , which can be approximated by their asymptotic expressions and were\nnumerically calculated recently in the process of the work of Ref. [3]. These\nare the diagrams of six concrete subsets. Subset 6 is formed by insertion\ninto photon line of the muon vertex four-loop vacuum polarization graphs with\nthree electron loops. Subset 7 consists of diagrams, generated by dressing\nthis photon line by two two-loop vacuum polarization insertions with electron\nloops. The photon line of the diagrams of Subset 8 contains three-loop photon vacuum polarization insertions with two electron loops and the additional\none-loop bubble. Subset 9 represents the sum of the diagrams, which have\n\"quenched\" three-loop and one-loop subsequent vacuum polarization insertions\ninto photon line. Thus, Subset 8 and Subset 9 can be generated from the\nfour-loop Subset 1 and Subset 2 by inserting into their dressed photon line\nthe additional one-loop electron bubble. Subset 10 consists from the five-loop\ndiagrams with the photon line, dressed by two-loop photon vacuum polarization contribution and two electron loops. Subset 11 is formed by inserting into\nphoton line of four subsequent one-loop vacuum polarization contributions. It\nis necessary to emphasize, that all vacuum polarization subgraphs of the diagrams, considered in this report, are containing electron loops only. Let us\ncompare the numerical analogs of analytical asymptotic five-loop contributions\nto a\u03bc , calculated in Ref. [7], with the concrete results [24] of direct numerical\ncalculations of Ref. [3]. The value of the constant, related to Subset 9, was\nderived in the process of this work by more careful numerical studies of the analytical result of Ref. [7]. The asymptotic analytical expression of the Subset\n11 was confirmed in [25].\n\n\fTable 1.

Thus, their asymptotic analytical\nresults, calculated in Ref. [7], and confirmed in Ref. [26], really differ from the\nnumerical ones by the leading O(me /m\u03bc )-terms. In the case of the five-loop\ndiagrams from Subset 9, the O(me /m\u03bc )- terms should also be responsible for\nelimination of minor differences between asymptotic and numerical results. Indeed, since this statement is correct for the four-loop diagrams of Subset 2\n(compare Eq.(6) and Eq.(9) with Eq.(10)), it should also be correct in the case\nof five-loop diagrams from Subset 9, which have similar topological structure.\nA similar argument may also hold for the five-loop diagrams from Subset 8.\nThe discussions presented in this summary provide additional support for the\nresults of the numerical calculations [3] of the definite five-loop contributions to\na\u03bc . However, the dominant contribution of evaluated 2958 diagrams is coming\nfrom the subset with light-by-light scattering electron loop internal insertion,\nwhich at present is difficult to check. Moreover, other 6122 diagrams still remained uncalculated. In spite of this we think that that the agreement of the\nnew tenth-order QED contribution to a\u03bc , namely 663(20)(\u03b1/\u03c0)5 [3], with the\nestimate,\u2248 658(\u03b1/\u03c0)5 [27], obtained by taking into account the results of the\n10th-order calculations in the improved renormalization-group inspired estimates of the high-order corrections to is of theoretical interest and deserve\nfurther attention. The current difference between phenomenological and experimental results for a\u03bc can not be described by the five-loop corrections (for\na review see [2]). They may become really important for planning new a\u03bc\nexperiments.\nI would like to to thank T. Kinoshita for useful discussions from 1990 to\nthe present and for the invitation to present the Seminar in Cornell. I am\ngrateful to S.L. Adler for his invitation to visit Institute for Advanced Study\nin Princeton, where this summary was written.\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nG. W. Bennett et al., Phys. Rev.
