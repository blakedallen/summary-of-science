Introduction\nIn [2], Bergman defined the logarithmic limit-set of an algebraic variety in order to study\nits exponential behavior at infinity. We follow [13] in calling this set the Bergman complex\nof the variety. Bergman complexes have recently received considerable attention in several\nareas, such as tropical algebraic geometry and dynamical systems. They are the nonArchimedean amoebas of [5] and the tropical varieties of [10, 13].\nWhen the variety is a linear space, so that the defining ideal I is generated by linear\nforms, Sturmfels [13] showed that the Bergman complex can be described solely in terms of\nthe matroid associated to the linear ideal. He used this description to define the Bergman\ncomplex B(M ) of an arbitrary matroid M . Ardila and Klivans [1] showed that, appropriately\nsubdivided, the Bergman complex of a matroid M is the order complex of the proper part\nof the lattice of flats LM of the matroid. This result implies that the Bergman complex of\nan arbitrary matroid M is a finite, pure polyhedral complex, which is homotopy equivalent\nto a wedge of spheres.\nTotal positivity is another topic which has received a great deal of recent interest. Although the classical theory concerns matrices in which all minors are positive, in the past\ndecade this theory has been extended by Lusztig [6, 7], who introduced the totally positive\nvariety G>0 in an arbitrary reductive group G and the totally positive part B>0 of a real\nflag variety B. More recently, the positive part of the tropicalization of an affine variety (or\npositive tropical variety, for short) was introduced by Speyer and Williams [11].\nSturmfels [14] suggested the notion of a positive Bergman complex B + (M ) of an oriented\nmatroid M and conjectured its relation to the Las Vergnas face lattice of M . We define\nthe positive Bergman complex and positive Bergman fan so that given a linear ideal I with\nassociated oriented matroid MI , the positive tropical variety associated to I is equal to the\npositive Bergman fan of MI .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\nWe give a proof of Sturmfels' conjecture: appropriately subdivided, B + (M ) is a geometric\nrealization of the order complex of the proper part of the Las Vergnas face lattice of M .\nB + (M ) is homeomorphic to a sphere and naturally sits inside B(M ), the Bergman complex\nof the underlying unoriented matroid of M . We conclude by showing that, for the oriented\nmatroid of the complete graph Kn , the face poset of a certain \"coarse\" subdivision of\nB + (Kn ) is dual to the face poset of the associahedron An\u22122 .\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce a certain oriented matroid\nM\u03c9 which will play an important role in our work. In Section 3 we define the positive\nBergman complex and prove our main theorem. In Section 4 we explain the relation between\nthe positive Bergman complex of an oriented matroid and the positive tropical variety of a\nlinear ideal. In Section 5 we describe the topology of the positive Bergman complex of an\noriented matroid. Finally, in Sections 6 and 7 we describe in detail the positive Bergman\ncomplex of the oriented matroid of Kn : we relate it to the associahedron, and we give a\nformula for the number of full-dimensional fine cells within a full-dimensional coarse cell.\nThroughout this paper we will abuse notation and use M to denote either a matroid\nor oriented matroid, depending on the context. Similarly, we will use the term \"circuits\"\nto describe either unsigned or signed circuits. When the distinction between matroids and\noriented matroids is important, we will use M to denote the underlying matroid of an\noriented matroid M .\n2. The Oriented Matroid Mw\nLet M be an oriented matroid on the ground set [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} whose collection of\nsigned circuits is C. Let \u03c9 \u2208 Rn and regard \u03c9 as a weight function on [n]. For any circuit\nC \u2208 C define in\u03c9 (C) to be the \u03c9-maximal subset of the circuit C \u2013 in other words, the\ncollection of elements of C which have the largest weight. We will say that the circuit C\nachieves its largest weight with respect to \u03c9 at in\u03c9 (C). Define in\u03c9 (C) to be the collection\nof inclusion-minimal sets of the collection {in\u03c9 (C) | C \u2208 C}. We then define M\u03c9 to be the\noriented matroid on [n] whose collection of circuits is in\u03c9 (C).\nIt is not clear that M\u03c9 is a well-defined oriented matroid; we will prove this shortly.\nGiven \u03c9 \u2208 Rn , let F(\u03c9) denote the unique flag of subsets \u2205 = F0 \u2282 F1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk \u2282\nFk+1 = [n] such that \u03c9 is constant on each set Fi \\ Fi\u22121 and satisfies \u03c9|Fi \\Fi\u22121 < \u03c9|Fi+1 \\Fi .\nWe call F(\u03c9) the flag of \u03c9, and we say that the weight class of \u03c9 or of the flag F is the set\nof vectors \u03bd such that F(\u03bd) = F.\nIt is clear that M\u03c9 depends only on the flag F := F(\u03c9) and so we also refer to this\noriented matroid as MF .\nExample 2.1. Let M be the oriented matroid of the digraph D shown in Figure 1. Equivalently, let M be the oriented matroid of the point configuration shown in Figure 2.\nNote that D is an acyclic orientation of K4 , the complete graph on 4 vertices. The\nsigned circuits C of M are {12\u03044, 13\u03045, 23\u03046, 45\u03046, 12\u030456\u0304, 13\u030446, 23\u03044\u03045}, together with the negatives\nof every set of this collection. Choose \u03c9 such that \u03c96 < \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c93 = \u03c94 = \u03c95 , which\ncorresponds to the flag \u2205 \u2282 {6} \u2282 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n0\n1\n000000\n0\n1\n00111111\n11\n00\n11\n0\n1\n000000\n111111\n0\n1\n3\n0\n1\n000000\n111111\n06\n1\n1 111111\n0\n1\n000000\n0\n1\n0\n1\n000000\n111111\n0\n1\n4\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0\n1\n000000\n111111\n0\n00111111\n11\n001\n0 5 11\n1\n000000\n0\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.

A point configuration\nIf we calculate in\u03c9 (C) for each C \u2208 C we get {12\u03044, 13\u03045, 23\u0304, 45\u0304, 12\u03045, 13\u03044, 23\u03044\u03045}, together\nwith the negatives of every set of this collection. However, 23\u03044\u03045 is not inclusion-minimal in\nthis collection, as it contains 23\u0304 and 4\u03045. Thus in\u03c9 (C) is equal to {12\u03044, 13\u03045, 23\u0304, 45\u0304, 12\u03045, 13\u03044},\ntogether with the negatives of every set, and M\u03c9 is the oriented matroid whose collection of\nsigned circuits is in\u03c9 (C).

[4, Theorem 3.2.5] Let C be a collection of signed subsets of a set E satisfying\nC1, C2, C3. Then C4 is equivalent to C4':\nC4'. for all X0 , X1 \u2208 C, e \u2208 X0+ \u2229 X1\u2212 and f \u2208 (X0+ \\ X1\u2212 ) \u222a (X0\u2212 \\ X1+ ), there is a Z \u2208 C\nsuch that Z + \u2286 (X0+ \u222a X1+ ) \\ {e}, Z \u2212 \u2286 (X0\u2212 \u222a X1\u2212 ) \\ {e}, and f \u2208 Z.\n\n\f4\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\nProposition 2.3. Let M be an oriented matroid on [n] and \u03c9 \u2208 Rn . Then M\u03c9 is an\noriented matroid.\nProof. The strategy of our proof is to show that if C1, C2, C3 and C4' hold for M , then\nC1, C2, C3 and C4 hold for M\u03c9 . First note that it is obvious that C1 and C2 hold for\nM\u03c9 . C3 holds for M\u03c9 because we defined in\u03c9 (C) to consist of inclusion-minimal elements.\nIt remains to show that C4 holds for M\u03c9 . To do this, we start with two circuits in M\u03c9 , lift\nthem to circuits in M , and then use C4' for M to show that C4 holds for M\u03c9 .\nTake Y0 and Y1 in in\u03c9 (C) such that Y1 6= \u2212Y0 and e \u2208 Y0+ \u2229 Y1\u2212 . By definition, there\nexist circuits X0 and X1 of M such that Y0 = in\u03c9 (X0 ) and Y1 = in\u03c9 (X1 ). Notice that the\npresence of e in Y0 and Y1 guarantees that the maximum weights occurring in X0 and in\nX1 are both equal to \u03c9e .\nChoose any f \u2208 (Y0+ \\ Y1\u2212 ) \u222a (Y0\u2212 \\ Y1+ ). Clearly such an f exists. Then f \u2208 (X0+ \\ X1\u2212 ) \u222a\n(X0\u2212 \\ X1+ ). By C4' for M , there exists a circuit X in C such that\n(a1 )\n(a2 )\n(a3 )\n\nX + \u2286 (X0+ \u222a X1+ ) \\ {e},\nX \u2212 \u2286 (X0\u2212 \u222a X1\u2212 ) \\ {e}, and\nf \u2208 X.\n\nLook at in\u03c9 (X). We will prove that in\u03c9 (X) contains the third circuit of M\u03c9 which we\nare looking for. We want to show that\n(b1 )\n(b2 )\n\nin\u03c9 (X)+ \u2286 (Y0+ \u222a Y1+ ) \\ {e}\nin\u03c9 (X)\u2212 \u2286 (Y0\u2212 \u222a Y1\u2212 ) \\ {e}\n\nFirst, it is obvious that e is not in in\u03c9 (X)+ , since e was not in X + . Clearly in\u03c9 (X)+ is a\nsubset of X0+ \u222a X1+ . To show (b1 ) and (b2 ), we just need to show that the maximum weight\nwhich occurs in X is also equal to \u03c9e . By (a1 ) and (a2 ), this maximum weight is at most\n\u03c9e . By (a3 ), equality is attained for f \u2208 X, since \u03c9f = \u03c9e .\nNote that if in\u03c9 (X) is not inclusion-minimal in the set {in\u03c9 (C) | C a circuit of M },\nthen it contains some inclusion-minimal in\u03c9 (W ) for another circuit W of M . And since\nin\u03c9 (X)+ \u2286 (Y0+ \u222a Y1+ ) \\ {e} and in\u03c9 (X)\u2212 \u2286 (Y0\u2212 \u222a Y1\u2212 ) \\ {e}, it is clear that we also have\nin\u03c9 (W )+ \u2286 (Y0+ \u222a Y1+ ) \\ {e} and in\u03c9 (W )\u2212 \u2286 (Y0\u2212 \u222a Y1\u2212 ) \\ {e}.\n\u0003\nIn the following proposition, we describe the bases of M\u03c9 and their orientations. Let us\nP\nsay that if S \u2282 [n] and \u03c9 \u2208 Rn , the \u03c9-weight of S is the sum i\u2208S \u03c9i .\nProposition 2.4. The bases of M\u03c9 are the bases of M which have minimal \u03c9-weight. The\nbasis orientations of M\u03c9 are equal to their orientations in M .\nProof. We know that if N is an oriented matroid on [n] with signed circuits C, then the\nbases of N are the maximal subsets of [n] which contain no circuit. Thus, the bases B of\nM\u03c9 are the maximal subsets of [n] which do not contain a set of the collection {in\u03c9 (C) |\nC a circuit of M }. We want to show that B is exactly the set of bases of M which have\nminimal \u03c9-weight.\nFirst let us choose a basis B of M which has minimal \u03c9-weight. We claim that B is\nindependent in M\u03c9 . Suppose that B contains a subset of the form in\u03c9 (C), where C is\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n5\n\na circuit of M . Write B = in\u03c9 (C) \u222a {b1 , . . . , bm }, and choose any c \u2208 in\u03c9 (C). We now\nconstruct a new basis B \u2032\u2032 of M of smaller weight than B, as follows. Start with the set\nC. We know that C \u222a {b1 , . . . , bm } is a spanning set of M . Let B0 be a minimal subset\n(possibly empty) of {b1 , . . . , bm } such that C \u222a B0 is still a spanning set of M . Since C is\nminimally dependent in M , the set B \u2032 := (C \\ {c}) \u222a B0 will be a basis of M . Now by the\nbasis exchange axiom, for some b \u2208 B \u2032 \\ B, B \u2032\u2032 := (B \\ {c}) \u222a {b} is a basis of M . Since\nb \u2208 B \u2032 \\ B, it follows that b \u2208 C \\ in\u03c9 (C). Thus, the weight of b is strictly less than the\nweight of c, which implies that the weight of B \u2032\u2032 is less than the weight of B. This is a\ncontradiction.\nThe previous argument shows that r(M ) \u2264 r(M\u03c9 ). But every circuit of M\u03c9 is contained\nin a circuit of M , so r(M ) \u2265 r(M\u03c9 ). It follows that M and M\u03c9 have the same rank.\nNow let B be a basis of M\u03c9 , i.e. B is a maximal subset of [n] which does not contain\nan element of {in\u03c9 (C) | C a circuit of M }. We claim that B is a basis of M with minimal\n\u03c9-weight. First note that B is clearly independent in M : if it were dependent in M , it would\ncontain some circuit C of M and hence would contain in\u03c9 (C). Also, B has r(M\u03c9 ) = r(M )\nelements. Therefore it is a basis of M .\nFinally, let us show that B has minimal \u03c9-weight. Suppose not. Let c1 , . . . , cr be the\nelements of B with highest weight. We claim that {c1 , . . . , cr } \u2287 in\u03c9 (C) for some circuit\nC of M , which will be a contradiction. Since B is a basis of M , adding to B any element\nof [n] \\ B creates a circuit. Since B is not a basis of minimal \u03c9-weight, there must be an\nelement b \u2208 [n] \\ B such that the weight of b is strictly less than the weight of each of the\nelements c1 , . . . , cr . Thus B \u222a b contains a circuit C, and in\u03c9 (C) \u2286 {c1 , . . . , cr }, as claimed.\nTo prove the claim about orientations, start with a basis B of minimal weight of M .\nRecall that an oriented matroid has exactly two basis orientations, which are opposite\nto each other. Therefore we can assume without loss of generality that B has the same\norientation in M and M\u03c9 .\nFor any two ordered bases B1 = (e, x2 , . . . , xr ) and B2 = (f, x2 . . . , xr ) of M\u03c9 with e 6= f ,\nwe have\n\u03c7\u03c9 (e, x2 , . . . , xr ) = \u2212C\u03c9 (e)C\u03c9 (f )\u03c7\u03c9 (f, x2 . . . , xr ),\nwhere \u03c7\u03c9 is the chirotope of M\u03c9 , and C\u03c9 is one of the two opposite signed circuits of M\u03c9 in\n{e, f, x2 , . . . , xr }. Now B1 and B2 are also bases of M ; let C be one of the two opposite signed\ncircuits of M in {e, f, x2 , . . . , xr }. Then in\u03c9 (C) contains a circuit of M\u03c9 ; it must be either C\u03c9\nor \u2212C\u03c9 . In any case, we have C(e)C(f ) = C\u03c9 (e)C\u03c9 (f ), so \u03c7\u03c9 (B1 )\u03c7\u03c9 (B2 ) = \u03c7(B1 )\u03c7(B2 ).\nIt follows that if B1 has the same orientation in M and M\u03c9 , then so does B2 .\nRecall that one can obtain any basis of a matroid from any other by a sequence of simple\nbasis exchanges of the type above. Since B has the same orientation in M and M\u03c9 , so does\nany other basis of M\u03c9 .\n\u0003\n3. The Positive Bergman Complex\nOur goal in this section is to define the positive Bergman complex of an oriented matroid M and to relate it to the Las Vergnas face lattice of M , thus answering Sturmfels'\n\n\f6\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\nquestion [14]. We begin by giving some background on the Bergman complex and fan of a\n(unoriented) matroid.\nThe Bergman fan of a matroid M on the ground set [n] is the set\ne ) := {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn : M\u03c9 has no loops}.\nB(M\nThe Bergman complex of M is\nB(M ) := {\u03c9 \u2208 S n\u22122 : M\u03c9 has no loops},\nwhere S n\u22122 is the sphere { \u03c9 \u2208 Rn : \u03c91 + * * * + \u03c9n = 0 , \u03c912 + * * * + \u03c9n2 = 1}.\nFor simplicity, in this section we will concentrate on the Bergman complex of M , but\nsimilar arguments hold for the Bergman fan of M .\nSince the matroid M\u03c9 depends only on the weight class that \u03c9 is in, the Bergman complex\nof M is a disjoint union of the weight classes of flags F such that MF has no loops. We say\nthat the weight class of a flag F is valid for M if MF has no loops.\nThere are two polyhedral subdivisions of B(M ), one of which is clearly finer than the\nother. The fine subdivision of B(M ) is the subdivision of B(M ) into valid weight classes:\ntwo vectors u and v of B(M ) are in the same class if and only if F(u) = F(v). The coarse\nsubdivision of B(M ) is the subdivision of B(M ) into M\u03c9 -equivalence classes: two vectors u\nand v of B(M ) are in the same class if and only if Mu = Mv .\nThe following results give alternative descriptions of B(M ):\nTheorem 3.1. [1] Given an (unoriented) matroid M on the ground set [n] and \u03c9 \u2208 Rn\nwhich corresponds to a flag F := F(\u03c9), the following are equivalent:\n1. MF has no loops.\n2. For each circuit C of M , in\u03c9 (C) contains at least two elements of C.\n3. F is a flag of flats of M .\nCorollary 3.2. [1] Let M be a (unoriented) matroid. Then the fine subdivision of the\nBergman complex B(M ) is a geometric realization of \u2206(LM \u2212 { 0\u0302 , 1\u0302 } ), the order complex\nof the proper part of the lattice of flats of M .\nWe are now ready for the positive analogues of these concepts. The positive Bergman\nfan of an oriented matroid M on the ground set [n] is\nBe+ (M ) := {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn : M\u03c9 is acyclic}.\nThe positive Bergman complex of M is\nB + (M ) := {\u03c9 \u2208 S n\u22122 : M\u03c9 is acyclic}.\nWithin each equivalence class of the coarse subdivision of B(M ), the vectors \u03c9 give rise\nto the same unoriented M\u03c9 . Since the orientation of M\u03c9 is inherited from that of M , they\nalso give rise to the same oriented matroid M\u03c9 . Therefore each coarse cell of B(M ) is\neither completely contained in or disjoint from B + (M ). Thus B + (M ) inherits the coarse\nand the fine subdivisions from B(M ), and each subdivision of B + (M ) is a subcomplex of\nthe corresponding subdivision of B(M ).\nLet M be an acyclic oriented matroid on the ground set [n]. We say that a covector\nv \u2208 {+, \u2212, 0}n of M is positive if each of its entries is + or 0. We say that a flat of M is\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n7\n\npositive if it is the 0-set of a positive covector. Additionally, we consider the set [n] to be\na positive flat. For example, if M is the matroid of Example 2.1, then 16 is a positive flat\nwhich is the 0-set of the positive covector (0 + + + + 0).\nThe Las Vergnas face lattice Flv (M ) is the lattice of positive flats of M , ordered by\ncontainment. Note that the lattice of positive flats of the oriented matroid M sits inside\nLM , the lattice of flats of M .\nExample 3.3. Let M be the oriented matroid from Example 2.1. The positive covectors of\nM are {0++++ 0, 0 0+0++, +++ 0 0 0, 0+++++, +++ 0++, +++++ 0, ++++++}\nand the positive flats are {16, 124, 456, 1, 4, 6, \u2205, 123456}. The lattice of positive flats of M\nis shown in Figure 4, alongside the lattice of flats of M .\n123456\n\n16\n\n124\n\n456\n\n1\n\n4\n\n6\n\n123456\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n0012411\n11\n0013511\n11\n0023611\n11\n003411\n11\n002511\n11\n001611\n11\n00456\n11\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n4\n5\n1\n2 11\n3 11\n001111111\n11\n00\n11\n00\n00\n00\n11\n006\n11\n0000000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0001111111\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n00\n11\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n001111111\n11\n\nFigure 4. The lattice of positive flats and the lattice of flats.\nWe now give an analogue of Theorem 3.1.\nTheorem 3.4. Given an oriented matroid M and \u03c9 \u2208 Rn which corresponds to a flag\nF := F(\u03c9), the following are equivalent:\n1. MF is acyclic.\n2. For each signed circuit C of M , in\u03c9 (C) contains a positive element and a negative\nelement of C.\n3. F is a flag of positive flats of M .\nProof. First we will show that 1 and 2 are equivalent. The statement that M\u03c9 is acyclic\nmeans that M\u03c9 has no all-positive circuit: in other words, each circuit of M\u03c9 contains a\npositive and a negative term. Since M\u03c9 is the matroid whose circuits are the inclusionminimal elements of the set {in\u03c9 (C) | C a circuit of M }, this means that for each circuit\nC of M , in\u03c9 C contains a positive and a negative term. Finally, this is equivalent to the\nstatement that for each circuit C of M , C achieves its maximum value with respect to \u03c9\non both C + and C \u2212 .\nNext we show that 3 implies 2. Assume we have an \u03c9 such that F is a flag of positive\nflats. Let the flats of this flag be F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 . . . \u2282 Fk . For each Fi , ([n] \u2212 Fi ) is a positive\ncovector. By orthogonality of circuits and covectors, we know that for any circuit C and\n\n\f8\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\nany covector Y , (C + \u2229 Y ) and (C \u2212 \u2229 Y ) are either both empty or both non-empty. For any\ncircuit C of M , consider the largest i such that C \u2229 ([n] \u2212 Fi ) is non-empty. Then clearly C\nwill attain its maximum on Fi+1 \u2212 Fi and in\u03c9 (C) contains a positive element and a negative\nelement of C.\nFinally, assume that 1 and 2 hold, but 3 does not. From 1 we know that MF is acyclic;\ntherefore the unoriented MF has no loops, and F is a flag of flats by Theorem 3.1. Let Fi be\na flat which is not positive; by [4, Proposition 9.1.2] this is equivalent to saying that M/Fi\nis not acyclic. Let C be a positive circuit of M/Fi ; then we can find a circuit X of M such\nthat C = X \u2212 Fi . Then X has positive elements of weight greater than \u03c9i , and no negative\nelements of weight greater than \u03c9i . It follows that in\u03c9 (X) is positive, contradicting 2.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.5. Let M be an oriented matroid. Then the fine subdivision of B + (M ) is a\ngeometric realization of \u2206(Flv (M ) \u2212 { 0\u0302 , 1\u0302 } ), the order complex of the proper part of the\nLas Vergnas face lattice of M .\n4. Connection with Positive Tropical Varieties\nIn [11], the notion of the positive part of the tropicalization of an affine variety (or positive\ntropical variety, for short) was introduced, an object which has the structure of a polyhedral\nfan in Rn . In order to describe this object, we must define an initial ideal.\nP\nLet R = R[x1 , . . . , xn ] and \u03c9 \u2208 Rn . If f =\nci xai \u2208 R, define the initial form in\u03c9 (f ) \u2208 R\nto be the sum of all terms ci xai such that the inner product \u03c9 * ai is maximal. For an ideal\nI of R[x1 , . . . , xn ], define the initial ideal in\u03c9 (I) to be the ideal generated by in\u03c9 (f ) for all\nf \u2208 I.\nIf I is an ideal in a polynomial ring with n variables, the positive tropical variety associated to I is denoted by Trop+ V (I) and can be characterized as follows:\nTrop+ V (I) = {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn | in\u03c9 (I) contains no nonzero polynomials in R+ [x1 , . . . , xn ]}.\nNow recall that if I is a linear ideal (an ideal generated by linear forms), we can associate\nto it an oriented matroid MI as follows. Write each linear form f \u2208 I in the form a1 xi1 +\na2 xi2 + * * * + am xim = b1 xj1 + b2 xj2 + * * * + bn xjn , where ai , bi > 0 for all i. We then define\nMI to be the oriented matroid whose set of signed circuits consists of all minimal collections\nof the form {i1 i2 . . . im j\u03041 j\u03042 . . . j\u0304n }. We now prove the following easy statement.\nProposition 4.1. If I is a linear ideal and MI is the associated oriented matroid, then\ne + (MI ).\nTrop+ V (I) = B\nProof.\ne + (MI ) = {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn | (MI )\u03c9 is acyclic}\nB\n\n= {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn | (MI )\u03c9 has no all-positive circuit}\n= {\u03c9 \u2208 Rn | in\u03c9 (I) contains no nonzero polynomial in R+ [x1 , . . . , xn ]}\n= Trop+ V (I).\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n9\n\n5. Topology of the Positive Bergman Complex\nThe topology of the positive Bergman complex of an oriented matroid is very simple: it\nis homeomorphic to a sphere. This follows from Corollary 3.5 together with results about\nthe Las Vergnas face lattice, which we will review here.\nTheorem 5.1. [4, Theorem 4.3.5] Let M be an acyclic oriented matroid of rank r. Then\nthe Las Vergnas lattice Flv (M ) is isomorphic to the face lattice of a P L regular cell decomposition of the (r \u2212 2)-sphere.\nProposition 5.2. [4, Proposition 4.7.8] Let \u2206 be a regular cell complex. Then its geometric\nrealization is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of the order complex of its face\nposet.\nThe previous two results imply that the geometric realization of the order complex of the\nLas Vergnas lattice is homeomorphic to a sphere.\nPutting this together with Corollary 3.5, we get the following result.\nCorollary 5.3. The positive Bergman complex of an oriented matroid is homeomorphic to\na sphere.\n6. The positive Bergman complex of the complete graph\nIn this section, we wish to describe the positive Bergman complex B + (Kn ) of the graphical\noriented matroid M (Kn ) of an acyclic orientation of the complete graph Kn . We start by\nreviewing the description of the Bergman complex B(Kn ) of the unoriented matroid M (Kn ),\nobtained in [1]. For the moment we need to consider Kn as an unoriented graph.\nAn equidistant n-tree T is a rooted tree with n leaves labeled 1, . . . , n, and lengths assigned\nto each edge in such a way that the total distances from the root to each leaf are all equal.\nThe internal edges are required to have positive lengths. Figure 5 shows an example of an\nequidistant 4-tree.\nA\n\n0.4\n0.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\nA\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nB\n\nC\n\n2\n\nD\n\nB\n\n1.2\n\nD\n2\n0.2\n\nC\n\nFigure 5. An equidistant tree and its corresponding distance vector.\nn\nTo each equidistant n-tree T we assign a distance vector dT \u2208 R( 2 ) : the distance dij is\nequal to the length of the path joining leaves i and j in T . Figure 5 also shows the distance\nvector of the tree, regarded as a weight function on the edges of K4 .\ne n ) can be regarded as a space of equidistant n-trees, as the following\nThe Bergman fan B(K\ntheorem shows.\n\n\f10\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\nTheorem 6.1.

Conversely, any point\nweight function on the edges of Kn , is in the Bergman fan B(K\ne\nin B(Kn ) is the distance vector of a unique equidistant n-tree.\ne ) is well understood for any matroid\nAs mentioned earlier, the fine subdivision of B(M\ne n ) also has a nice\nM . The following theorem shows that the coarse subdivision of B(K\ndescription: it is a geometric realization of the well-studied simplicial complex of trees Tn ,\nsometimes called the Whitehouse complex [3, 8].\ne n ). Let T and T \u2032 be the corresponding equidistant\nTheorem 6.2. [1] Let \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 \u2208 B(K\nn-trees. The following are equivalent:\n1. \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 are in the same cell of the coarse subdivision.\n2. T and T \u2032 have the same combinatorial type.\nNow we return to the setting of oriented matroids. The positive Bergman complex\nB + (Kn ) is defined in terms of an acyclic orientation of Kn . This graph has n! acyclic\norientations, corresponding to the n! permutations of [n]. The orientation corresponding to\nthe permutation \u03c0 is given by \u03c0i \u2192 \u03c0j for i < j. Clearly the n! orientations of Kn will give\nrise to positive Bergman complexes which are equal up to relabeling. Therefore, throughout\nthis section, the edges of Kn will be oriented i \u2192 j for i < j.\nAs we go around a cycle C of Kn , C + is the set of edges which are crossed in the forward\ndirection, and C \u2212 is the set of edges which are crossed in the backward direction.\nProposition 6.3. Let \u03c9 be a weight vector on the edges of the oriented complete graph Kn .\nLet T be the corresponding equidistant tree. The following are equivalent:\n1. \u03c9 is in B + (Kn ).\n2. T can be drawn in the plane without crossings in such a way that its leaves are\nnumbered 1, 2, . . . , n from left to right.\nProof. We add three intermediate steps to the equivalence:\n(a) In any cycle C, the \u03c9-maximum is achieved in C + and C \u2212 .\n(b) In any triangle C, the \u03c9-maximum is achieved in C + and C \u2212 .\n(c) For any three leaves i < j < k in T , the leaf j does not branch off before i and k;\ni.e.,their branching order is one of the following:\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\nThe equivalence 1 \u21d4 (a) follows from Theorem 3.4, and the implication (a) \u21d2 (b)\nis trivial. Now we show that (b) \u21d2 (a). Proceed by contradiction. Consider a cycle\nC = v1 . . . vk , with k minimal, such that (a) is not satisfied. Consider the cycles T =\nv1 vk\u22121 vk and C \u2032 = v1 v2 . . . vk\u22121 , which do satisfy (a). Since C does not satisfy (a), the edge\nv1 vk\u22121 must be \u03c9-maximum in T , along with another edge e of the opposite orientation.\nSimilarly, the edge vk\u22121 v1 must be \u03c9-maximum in C \u2032 , along with another edge f of the\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n11\n\nopposite orientation. Therefore, in C, the edges e and f are \u03c9-maximum and have opposite\norientations. This is a contradiction.\nLet us now show (b) \u21d4 (c). In triangle ijk (where we can assume i < j < k), (b) holds if\nand only if we have one of the following:\n\u03c9ij < \u03c9jk = \u03c9ik , or \u03c9ij = \u03c9jk = \u03c9ik , or \u03c9jk < \u03c9ij = \u03c9ik .\nThese three conditions correspond, in that order, to the three possible branching orders of\ni, j and k in T prescribed by condition (c).\nFinally we show (c) \u21d4 2. The backward implication is immediate. We prove the forward\nimplication by induction on n. The case n = 3 is clear. Now let n \u2265 4, and assume that\ncondition (c) holds. Consider a lowest internal node v; it is incident to several leaves, which\nmust have consecutive labels i, i + 1, . . . , j by (c). Let T \u2032 be the tree obtained from T by\nremoving leaf i. This smaller tree satisfies (c), so it can be drawn in the plane with the\nleaves in order from left to right. Now we simply find node v in this drawing, and attach\nleaf i to it, putting it to the left of all the other leaves incident to v. This is a drawing of\nT satisfying 2.\n\u0003\nThe associahedron An\u22122 is a well-known (n \u2212 2)-dimensional polytope whose vertices\ncorrespond to planar rooted trees [15]. There is a close relationship between B + (Kn ) and\nAn\u22122 .\nCorollary 6.4. The face poset of the coarse subdivision of B + (Kn ), with a b\n1 attached, is\ndual to the face poset of the associahedron An\u22122 .\nProof. In the trees corresponding to the cells of B + (Kn ), the labeling of the leaves always\nincreases from left to right. We can forget these labels and obtain the usual presentation of\nthe dual to the associahedron, whose facets correspond to planar rooted trees.\n\u0003\nFigure 6 shows the positive Bergman complex of K4 (in bold) within the Bergman complex of K4 . Vertices of the coarse subdivision are shown as black circles; vertices of the fine\nsubdivision but not the coarse subdivision are shown as transparent circles. Observe that\nthe coarse subdivision of B + (K4 ) is a pentagon, whose face poset is the face poset of the\nassociahedron A2 (which is self-dual).\nNow, recall that different orientations of Kn give rise to different positive Bergman complexes. Let us make two comments about the way in which these positive Bergman complexes fit together.\nConsider the n! different acyclic orientations o(\u03c0) of Kn , each corresponding to a permutation \u03c0 of [n]. Each orientation o(\u03c0) gives rise to a positive Bergman complex: it\nconsists of those weight vectors such that the corresponding tree can be drawn with the\nleaves labeled \u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0n from left to right. Clearly, each permutation and its reverse give\n+\nthe same positive Bergman complex. The n!\n2 possible positive Bergman complexes B (Kn )\ngive a covering of B(Kn ), and each one of them is dual to the associahedron An\u22122 . This\ncorresponds precisely to the known covering of the space of trees with n!\n2 polytopes dual to\nthe associahedron, as described in [3].\nAlso, recall from [1] that the Bergman complex B(Kn ) is topologically a wedge of (n \u2212 1)!\nspheres. It is now easy to realize this statement combinatorially as follows. Any tree can be\n\n\f12\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\u03c9 \u03c9 =\u03c9 =\u03c9 =\u03c9\n3\n00\n11\n111111111\n000000000\n000000000\n10111111111\n00\n11\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n0\n1\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n10111111111\n34\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n10111111111\n\u03c9 \u03c9 =\u03c9\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n0\n1\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n10111111111\n4\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n\u03c9\n000\n000\n111\n5 111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n2\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n135\n236\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n00\n11\n0011111\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n111111\n000000\n00000\n1111111\n0000000\n000000\n111111\n111111\n000000\n000\n111\n25\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n000000\n111111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n000000\n111111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n456\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n000000\n111111\n000\n111\n124\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n0000\n1111\n000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n00006111\n1\n16 1111\n3\n\n<\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<\n\n2\n\n6\n\n5=\n\n<\n\n2\n\n\u03c96\n\n\u03c91 = \u03c9 4 = \u03c9 5\n\n= \u03c93 = \u03c96\n\n<\n\n\u03c91 = \u03c94 = \u03c95\n\nFigure 6.

Therefore, B(Kn ) is covered by the\npositive Bergman complexes corresponding to the (n \u2212 1)! permutations \u03c0 such that \u03c01 = 1.\nIt follows that B(Kn ) is the wedge of (n \u2212 1)! spherical polytopes dual to the associahedron\nAn\u22122 .\n7. The number of fine cells in B + (Kn ) and B(Kn ).\nSince B + (Kn ) and B(Kn ) are (n \u2212 2)-dimensional, we will call the (n \u2212 2)-dimensional\ncells inside them full-dimensional. In this section we will give a formula reminiscent of the\n\"hook-length\" formula for the number of full-dimensional fine cells within a full-dimensional\ncoarse cell of B(Kn ).\nProposition 7.1. Let \u03c4 be a rooted binary tree with n labeled leaves. For each internal\nvertex v of \u03c4 , let d(v) be the number of internal vertices of \u03c4 which are descendants of v,\nincluding v. Let C(\u03c4 ) be the coarse cell of B(Kn ) corresponding to tree \u03c4 . There are exactly\n(n \u2212 1)!\nQ\nv d(v)\nfull-dimensional fine cells in C(\u03c4 ).\nn\nProof. The cell C(\u03c4 ) consists of the distance vectors d \u2208 R( 2 ) of all equidistant n-trees T of\ncombinatorial type \u03c4 . Notice that dij = 2h \u2212 2h(v), where v is the lowest common ancestor\nof leaves i and j in T , h(v) is the distance from v to the root of T , and h is the distance\nfrom the root of T to any of its leaves.\nTo specify a full-dimensional fine cell in C(\u03c4 ), one needs to specify the relative order of\nthe dij 's. Equivalently, in the tree T that d comes from, one needs to specify the relative\norder of the heights of the internal vertices, consistently with the combinatorial type of tree\n\u03c4 . Therefore, the fine cells in C(\u03c4 ) correspond to the labellings of the n \u2212 1 internal vertices\nof \u03c4 with the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1, such that the label of each vertex is smaller than the\nlabels of its offspring. In the language of [12, Sec. 1.3], these are precisely the increasing\nbinary trees of type \u03c4 \u2032 , where \u03c4 \u2032 is the result of removing the leaves of tree \u03c4 , and the edges\n\n\fTHE POSITIVE BERGMAN COMPLEX OF AN ORIENTED MATROID\n\n13\n\nincident to them. Figure 7 shows a tree type \u03c4 and one of the increasing binary trees of\ntype \u03c4 \u2032 .\n1\n\n3\n5\n\n2\n4\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 7. A tree type \u03c4 and an increasing binary tree of type \u03c4 \u2032 .\nSuppose we choose one of the (n\u22121)! labellings of \u03c4 \u2032 uniformly at random. Let A\u03c4 \u2032 be the\nQ\nevent that the chosen labeling L is increasing; it remains to show that P (A\u03c4 \u2032 ) = 1/ v d(v).\nLet \u03c41\u2032 and \u03c42\u2032 be the left and right subtrees of \u03c4 \u2032 . Let B1 and B2 be the events that \u03c41\u2032\nand \u03c42\u2032 are labeled increasingly in L, and let B be the event that the root of \u03c4 is labeled 1.\nThen A\u03c4 \u2032 = B \u2229 B1 \u2229 B2 . It is clear that B, B1 and B2 are independent events. It is also\nclear that P (B1 ) = P (A\u03c41\u2032 ) and P (B2 ) = P (A\u03c42\u2032 ). Therefore,\nP (A\u03c4 ) = P (B)P (B1 )P (B2 )\n1\nP (A\u03c41\u2032 )P (A\u03c42\u2032 ).\n=\nn\u22121\nThe result follows by induction.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is also possible to obtain analogous formulas for the number of fine cells inside a lowerdimensional coarse cell, corresponding to a rooted tree which is not binary. We omit the\ndetails.\nNotice that Proposition 7.1 is essentially equivalent to the formula for the number of\nlinear extensions of a poset whose Hasse diagram is a tree [12, Supp. Ex. 3.1].\nCorollary 7.2. The positive Bergman complex B + (Kn ) contains exactly (n \u2212 1)! fulldimensional fine cells. The Bergman complex B(Kn ) contains exactly n! (n \u2212 1)! / 2n\u22121\nfull-dimensional fine cells.\nProof. We recall the known bijection between increasing binary trees with vertices labeled\na1 < . . . < ak , and permutations of {a1 , . . . , ak } [12, Sec. 1.3]. It is defined recursively: the\npermutation \u03c0(T ) corresponding to the increasing binary tree T is \u03c0(T ) = \u03c0(T1 ) a1 \u03c0(T2 ),\nwhere T1 and T2 are the left and right subtrees of T . For example, the tree of Figure 7\ncorresponds to the permutation 57316284. It is not difficult to see how T can be recovered\nuniquely from \u03c0(T ).\nSince the full-dimensional fine cells of B + (Kn ) are in correspondence with the increasing\nbinary trees with labels 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, the first result follows.\nTo show the second result, recall that the Bergman complex B(Kn ) is covered by n!\npositive Bergman complexes. Each permutation \u03c0 of [n] gives rise to a positive Bergman\n\n\f14\n\nFEDERICO ARDILA, CAROLINE KLIVANS, AND LAUREN WILLIAMS\n\ncomplex B + (Kn ); this complex parameterizes those trees which can be drawn in the plane\nso that its leaves are in the order prescribed by \u03c0. With (n \u2212 1)! fine cells in each positive\nBergman complex, we get a covering of B(Kn ) with n!(n\u22121)! fine cells. Each fine cell appears\nseveral times in this covering, since it sits inside several positive Bergman complexes.\nMore precisely, each binary tree with n labeled leaves can be drawn in the plane in exactly\nn\u22121\n2\nways: at each internal vertex, we may or may not switch the left and right subtrees.\nTherefore, each fine cell of the Bergman complex B(Kn ) is inside 2n\u22121 different positive\nBergman complexes. The desired result follows.\n\u0003\nRecall that the maximum-dimensional fine cells of B(Kn ) correspond to the maximal\nchains in the lattice of flats of Kn ; i.e., the partition lattice \u03a0n . Thus we have given an\nalternative proof of the fact that there are n! (n \u2212 1)! / 2n\u22121 maximal chains in \u03a0n [12, Supp.\nEx. 3.3].\nAs an illustration of Corollary 7.2, notice that, in Figure 6, the positive Bergman complex\n+\nB (K4 ) consists of 3! = 6 fine cells, while the Bergman complex B(K4 ) consists of 4! 3! / 23 =\n18 fine cells.\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to Bernd Sturmfels for suggesting this project to\nus, and to Lou Billera for helpful conversations.\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
