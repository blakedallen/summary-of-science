A link\nkey is 128 bits long and a shared between two or\nmore units, a new link key can be derived whenever\nto improve security.\n\nABSTRACT- When Bluetooth devices come within the\nrange of another, an electronic conversation takes place\nto determine whether the devices in range are known or\nwhether one needs to control the other. Most Bluetooth\ndevices do not require any form of user interaction for\nthis to occur. If devices within range are known to one\nanother, the devices automatically form a networkknown as a pairing.\n\nEach device creates a random no and\nencrypts it together with its hardware address and\nproduces initialization key..\n\nAuthentication addresses the identity of each\ncommunicating device. The sender sends an encrypted\nauthentication request frame to the receiver. The\nreceiver sends an encrypted challenge frame back to the\nsender. Both perform a predefined algorithm. The\nsender sends its findings back to the receiver, which in\nturn either allows or denies the connection.\n\nAUTHENTICATION:\nThe Bluetooth authentication procedure is\nbased on a challenge-response scheme. Two devices\ninteracting in an authentication procedure are referred\nto as the claimant and the verifier. The verifier is the\nblue tooth device validating the identity of another\ndevice. The claimant is the device attempting to\nprove its identity.\n\nThere are three different functions for\nauthentication in Bluetooth-E1, E2, and E3. E1 is used\nwhen encrypting the authorization challenge-response\nvalues.E2 is for generating different link keys.E3 is used\nwhen creating the encryption key.\n\nThe challenge-response protocol validates\ndevices by verifying the knowledge of a secret key- a\nBluetooth link key. The steps in the authentication\nprocess are the following:\n\nKey words: link key, primitive root,\nchallenge response scheme\nGENERALIZATION OF INITIALIZATION\nKEY:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe creation of an initialization key is used when\nno other keys are present. The key is derived from a\nrandom number, a PIN, length of the PIN and a unit's\nhardware address. The PIN code can either be a\nfactory value or the user can enter a maximum of 16\noctets.\n\n\u2022\n\nGENERALIZATION OF LINK KEY AND LINK\nKEY EXCHANGE:\n\n\u2022\n\n228\n\nStep1: the claimant transmits its 48-bit\naddress (BD_ADD) to the verifier.\nStep2: the verifier transmits a 128-bit\nrandom challenge (AU_RAND) to the\nclaimant.\nStep3: the verifier uses the E1 algorithm to\ncompute an authentication response using\nthe address, link key and random\nchallenge as inputs.\nStep4: the claimant returns the computed\nresponse SRES, to the verifier.\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, February 2010\n\n\u2022\n\ndetach the one end messages sent by intruder C is\nshown in Fig.3.\n\nStep5: the verifier compares the SRES from\nthe claimant with the SRES that it computes.\n\u2022 Step 6: if the two 32-bit SRES values are\nequal, the verifier will continue connection\nestablishment.\n.The E1 authentication function used for the\nvalidation is based on the SAFER+ algorithm.\n\nIn the existing authentication scheme of Bluetooth\ntechnology mutual authentication is performed.\nFirst one device sends the random number for\nauthentication to the device second,\nThen the second device sends the response and sends\nanother random number for the verification of first\ndevice. Then the first device sends the response of\nrandom number send b second device. In this way the\nidentification of both the devices is done.\nIn the above figure .2, device A sends a random\nnumber R1 to device B for authentication of device\nB. Then the device B sends the random number R2\nand the device B sends the ResR2 to device B\nBehavior of intruder C in existing scheme:\n\nFig1: Authentication Process\nPROBLEM IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM:\n\nFig3:Message in Existing Authentication Process\nby the intruder\nSuppose an intruder C wants to make connection in\nbetween the both devices A and B.\nFig2: Message in Existing Authentication Process\n\n\u2022\n\nWhen the connection is made between the Bluetooth\ndevices, an intruder device can be there in different\nways. An intruder can act as the fake device in the\ndifferent roles. The fake device can behave as false\nslave or false master. Similarly the intruder can be a\nactive intruder or passive one. It can continue the\nconnections to the both communicating devices or\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n229\n\nDevice A sends random number R1 to the\nfake device B.\nFake device B now behaves as fake device\nB.\nNow the device B sends the response Res\nR1 to fake device A.\nIntruder's C sends the authentication\nrandom number R2 to fake device A.\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, February 2010\n\n\u2022\n\nchallenge is responded with another authentication\nchallenge from the genuine entities.\n\nThe intruder C sends the random number R2\nto device A.\n\u2022 The device A sends the Res R2 to fake\ndevice.\n\u2022 The fake device now sends the same\nresponse Resr2 to device.\nHence in this way the intruder device makes the\nconnection with the devices A and b.\n\nWith the improved authentication method, if\nmessages exchanged in a nested form such that first\nboth parties exchange their random values and\nclaimant does not sends its response from the verifier.\nThe messages are shown as below:\nNow there are two case in this authentication\nprocedure:\n\nIMPROVED AUTHENTICATION METHOD:\nIn the authentication scheme, mutual\nauthentication is performed exclusively between\nmaster and slave. First, one is authenticated with the\nAU_RAND (challenge) and SRES (response)\nexchange.\nThen\nthe\nother\nis\n\n3\u20444\n\nWhen the request for connection is generated\nfrom the intruder device C to device A.\n\n3\u20444\n\nWhen the request for connection is made from\nthe device A to device C.\n\nCase 1: request from c to A:\nIn this case when the intruder C will initiate the\nconnection establishment procedure with device A.\n\u2022\n\nThe fake device sends the random number\nR1 to device A.\n\u2022 The device A does not sends the response\nfor R1.\n\u2022 It sends the another random number R2 to\nfake device B for authentication and waits\nfor the response for R2.\nSuppose the fake device is trying to get the\nresponse from device B. It sends the same random\nnumber to devices B.\nThe device does not sends the response of\nR2,firstly it verifies the fake device A and sends the\none another random number R3 waits for the\nresponse of R3 from fake device.\nHence in this case the attacker cant' involve itself\ninto the devices A and B.\nCase 2: Request from A to C: in this case when\nthe request is made from device A. The following\nmessages are exchanged between the devices A, C\nand B\n\nAuthenticated again using a challenge\nresponse mechanism. We propose to change this\nauthentication message exchanges in a form such that\nfirst both parties exchange their authentication\nrandom value and claimant does not sends its\nresponse before getting the response from the\nverifier. In this method, the attacker cannot obtain\nSRES vale from the other party. Since the attacker\nacts as a verifier in both piconets, its authentication\n\n230\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/\nISSN 1947-5500\n\n\f(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,\nVol. 7, No. 2, February 2010\n\nimproved authenticated system with more security to\navoid the above said intruder attack.\n\nPLAUSIBLE EXCHANGE\nDIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE:\nDevice A selects a random number R1 such\nthat R1 < P a prime number which is having \u03b1 as its\nprimitive root and calculates S1= aR1mod p.

Each side keeps the R value Private and\nS values Public.\nDevice A computes K = S2R1mod p and B\ncomputes K = s1R2 mod p so the produce identical\nresults.\n\nFirst the authentication random number R1 is sent by\ndevice A.\n\nSo even though the intruder knows the P, S\nand \u03b1 value they can predict the S1 and S2 values.\nBut they couldn't predict the original random\nnumber.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe device C sends the same random\nnumber R1 to device B.\n\u2022 The device C does not send the response of\nR1,it sends the another random number R2\nto fake device A for authentication.\n\u2022 The device C transmits the random number\nR2 to device A and waits for the response of\nR2 from A.\n\u2022 The device A gives the response 'ResR2' of\nR2.\n\u2022 The device C gives theResR2 to device b.\n\u2022 The device B sends the ResR1in response to\nthe number R1 to device C.\n\u2022 The resR1 is sent as it is to device A by the\ndevice C.\nHence the connection is made between the\ndevices A and C and C and B, but this is only\npossible only when the request is initiated by the\ndevice A and simultaneously there is a connection\nbetween the device A and B.\n\nDevice A\n\nFake A\n\nDevice B\n\nIntruder\nR1\n\nS1\nS1\n\nR1\nS2\n\nR2\n\nR2\n\nS2\n\nRes R2\nRes R1\nPROCEDURE TO EXCHANGE KEYS:\nDevice A: S1= aR1mod p\n\nIntegrity is maintained, but the confidentiality is\ndisturbed.\nIMPLEMENTING MORE SECURITY\nRANDOM NUMBER EXCHANGE:\n\nFake B\n\nDevice B: S2 = aR2mod p\n\nFOR\n\nDevice A: K = s2R1mod p\n\nThe scheme implemented in case 2 was\ninsecure obviously.
