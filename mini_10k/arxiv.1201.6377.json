It is widely accepted that the detonation\nis caused by the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) that has\nreached the Chandresekhar mass limit. A variety of stellar systems have been proposed\nas progenitors. These progenitor candidates can be divided into two classes, the doubledegenerates, DD (Tutukov & Yungelson 1981; Van Kerkwijk et al. 2010), and the singledegenerates, SD (Iben & Tutukov 1984; Whelan & Iben 1973), based whether the system\nhas one or two WDs. After considering the full array of WD binaries (Branch et al. 1995;\nParthasarathy et al. 2007), reasonable SD progenitor models include the recurrent novae,\nsymbiotic stars, supersoft sources, helium stars, and spin-up/spin-down systems (Hachisu &\nKato 2001; Hachisu et al. 1999a; Hachisu et al. 1999b; Langer et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2009;\nJustham 2011). There is plausible evidence that the observed SNe Ia events could arise from\nmultiple progenitor channels (Maoz & Mannucci 2011).\nFor decades the progenitor question has gone unanswered; over the last decade the use\nof SNe Ia as cosmology tools has elevated the importance of this problem (c.f. Blandford\net al. 2010). The progenitor problem can be approached from many directions. The recent\nnearby supernova SN 2011fe has had modest limits placed (Li et al. 2011) on its pre-eruption\nprogenitor magnitude (MV must be fainter than -1), but this limit can only reject the most\nluminous red giant companion stars in a symbiotic system. Limits based on death rates of\nprogenitor candidates from population synthesis models have uncertainties that are too large\nto have any real utility in deciding between candidates. The recent claim to eliminate all SD\nmodels (Gilfanov & Bogdan 2010), based on the supersoft X-ray flux from elliptical galaxies,\nhas been broadly rejected for many strong reasons (Meng & Yang 2011; Di Stefano 2010;\nHachisu et al. 2010; Lipunov et al. 2010; Orio et al. 2010). The lack of even a small amount\nof hydrogen in SN Ia spectra (e.g. Leonard 2007) would appear to reject all SD candidates,\nbut this result is ambiguous because detailed models show that the hydrogen will not be\nvisible (Marietta et al. 2000), and some events have been seen to have hydrogen (Branch et\nal. 1983; Hamuy et al. 2003; but see Livio & Riess 2003). In all, there has been no decisive\nevidence proving or disproving any one progenitor candidate or class, and our community is\nroughly evenly divided in opinions.\nA promising method (Ruiz-Lapuente 1997; Canal et al. 2001) to distinguish between\ncandidates is to look for the former companion star near the center of nearby supernova\nremnants (SNRs), because the various progenitor classes have different types of companion\nstars that survive the explosion. Symbiotic progenitors must leave behind a red giant star\nin the middle of the SNR, while a helium star progenitor must leave the luminous helium\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nstar near the SNR center. A recurrent nova progenitor must leave either a red giant or\nsubgiant. (Some recurrent novae have main sequence companion stars, but these systems\nare dominated by the prior classical nova event that keeps the WD from gaining mass over\neach cycle; Schaefer et al. 2010.) Supersoft sources must have ex-companions that are either\nsubgiants or main sequence stars with mass >1.16 M\u2299 (Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012). This is\nthe minimum mass for which the system, with its near-Chandrasekhar mass WD, will have\na mass ratio of \u2265 5/6, which is required to drive fast accretion via Roche lobe overflow onto\nthe surface of the WD, and is confirmed by detailed models (Langer et al. 2000). Published\nspin-up/spin-down models (e.g. Justham 2011) account for angular momentum conservation\nin SD systems, spinning up the WD as it accretes, which delays the explosion trigger. After\nthe cessation of accretion, the WD spins down until the supernova is triggered. Due to\nshort time limits on the spin-down time (Yoon & Langer 2005), the companion star will still\nbe either a bright red giant or subgiant core. Importantly, these ex-companion stars will\nnot change their luminosity or surface temperature greatly; they should appear at largely\nthe same place on the HR diagram several centuries after the explosion (Marietta et al.\n2000; Pan et al. 2010; Podsiadlowski 2003). The DD model predicts that there will be no\nex-companion star. Thus, by looking near the center of a Type Ia SNR, the existence and\nnature of any ex-companion star will distinguish the progenitor system.\nThis method can only be applied to SNRs which definitely came from SNe Ia. In our\ngalaxy, only Tycho's SNR (SN 1572) and the remnant from SN 1006 are confidently known\nto be from SNe Ia (Schaefer 1996; Krause et al. 2008). Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004) looked\nnear the center of the Tycho remnant and identified a G2 IV star (i.e., a subgiant) called\nStar G near the center as the ex-companion based on its high proper motion at the right\ndistance. If this identification is confirmed, it would immediately rule out the DD and\nsymbiotic channels, pointing to the recurrent nova path. Unfortunately, various properties\nare still being disputed (Ihara et al. 2007; Kerzendorf et al. 2009; Hernandez et al. 2009).\nHernandez et al. (2009) performed a detailed analysis of hundreds of metal absorption lines\nto find that nickel and cobalt are anomalously over-abundant in the atmosphere of Star G.\nIf confirmed, this would strongly point to Star G having contamination from SN ejecta.\nFor now, the case is unresolved, although we are inclined to think that Star G is the excompanion star based on the Hernandez et al. (2009) paper. For the case of SN 1006, a red\ngiant ex-companion star can be ruled out (Ruiz-Lapuente 2011). A major challenge is that\ngalactic SNRs have large uncertainties in distances, high extinction, and crowded fields.\nRecently, we have applied this same method to SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). Four LMC SNRs have been confidently identified as coming from SNe Ia based on\nlight echo spectroscopy (Rest et al. 2005; 2008; A. Rest 2010, private communication) and\nX-ray spectroscopy (Hughes et al. 1995). The youngest and most symmetric of these is SNR\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n0509-67.5, which is from a SN 1991T class Type Ia explosion that occurred 400\u00b150 years\nago. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has taken deep images of SNR 0509-67.5 in B, V, I,\nand H\u03b1. Schaefer & Pagnotta (2012) report that the maximal (99.73% containment) central\nerror circle is empty of point sources to V=26.9, which corresponds to MV =+8.4 mag in the\nLMC. They also show that all SD models require the ex-companion to be more luminous\nthan MV =+4.2 mag (V=22.7 in the LMC). With this, all published SD models are rejected\nwith high confidence. The only remaining model is the DD, so the strong conclusion is that\nthe SN Ia event leading to SNR 0509-67.5 came from a double-degenerate system.\nIn this paper, we consider a second LMC remnant, SNR 0519-69.0. The light echo shows\nthe supernova spectrum to be that of a normal SN Ia, with an age of 600\u00b1200 years (Rest\net al. 2005; A. Rest 2010, private communication). We have used the same techniques as in\nSchaefer & Pagnotta (2012) on SNR 0519-69.0, applied to archival V and H\u03b1 HST images.\nThe case of SNR 0519-69.0 is not as optimal as for SNR 0509-67.5, because the SNR is older\nand more irregular in outline (leading to a substantially larger central error ellipse) and the\nstar density is higher (so the error circle is not empty of stars). The next three sections detail\nthe size and position of the central error circle, the contents of that region, and the severe\nconstraints on any possible progenitor model. In short, we demonstrate that SNR 0519-69.0\ndoes not have any post-main sequence ex-companion star, and this rejects the symbiotic,\nrecurrent nova, helium star, and spin-up/spin-down SD models.\n\n2.\n\nThe Center of SNR 0519-69.0\n\nWe have used public domain images of SNR 0519-69.0 from both HST and from the\nChandra X-ray observatory. The HST images were taken with the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys camera in April 2010 (J. P. Hughes P.I.). F658N (H\u03b1) and F550M (V band) observations were taken for a total of 4757 and 750 seconds, respectively. The data were processed\nand combined using the standard PyRAF procedures and were analyzed using the IRAF phot\npackage. The combined H\u03b1 and V image is presented in Figure 1. The Chandra X-ray observations in June 2000 had a total exposure of 40.6 kiloseconds (S. S. Holt P.I.), with images\navailable in three energy bands: 0.3-0.72 keV, 0.72-1.05 keV, 1.05-10 keV (Williams et al.\n(2001)).\nThe geometric center of the SNR was measured by two methods, both using the same\nprocedure, but operating off different data sets corresponding to gas at greatly different\ntemperatures. We constructed nine sets of perpendicular bisectors from edge to edge across\nthe remnant, each tilted approximately 10\u25e6 from the previous set. The center measurement\nfrom each set was retained and averaged together to obtain the geometric center. The RMS\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nscatter of the nine measurements is a good estimate of the measurement uncertainty. Table 1\npresents the geometric centers for both the H\u03b1 shell and the X-ray shell. These two positions\ndiffer by 0.5\u2032\u2032 from the average, which is a measure of the systematic uncertainty from any\none position by this method. The two centers have similar measurement uncertainty, and we\nknow of no reason to prefer one over the other, so the overall best estimate of the geometric\ncenter is taken to be a straight average of the two positions (see Table 1). The uncertainty in\nthis best geometric center comes from the addition in quadrature of the measurement error\n(0.7\u2032\u2032 ) and the systematic uncertainty (0.5\u2032\u2032 ), for a total of 0.9\u2032\u2032 .\nThe offset from the geometric center to the explosion site arises from asymmetries in the\nejection velocity and the surrounding interstellar medium. Schaefer & Pagnotta (2012) note\nthat the ejection velocity asymmetries are expected to be small, less than 10%, while any\nbipolar component of the ejection will produce zero offset. Asymmetric bubbles or clumps\nof gas or dust surrounding the expanding shell will produce an offset. In all of these cases,\nthe mechanism that causes the offset will also deform the edges of the shell, causing an\nout-of-round axis ratio. Schaefer & Pagnotta (2012) derive the offset from the measured\naxis ratio, but unfortunately the direction of the offset depends on knowing the cause of the\ndeformation. For SNR0519-69.0, the shell is closely round with no apparent deformation.\nThe edges of the shell display minor small-scale bumps, but such will lead to no significant\noffset. The Spitzer 24-micron infrared image shows the swept up and heated dust grains\n(Williams et al. 2011), with three broad brightenings evenly distributed around the edge of\nSNR 0519-69.0, showing no apparent association with asymmetries, so it appears that there\nare no systematic variations that deform one quadrant of the shell or cause any significant\noffset. A substantial qualification on this statement is that one quadrant of the remnant\n(towards the northeast), has a faint and thin outer arc, with a much brighter inner arc that\nlooks like it has run into some relatively dense region of the gas and dust. The outer edge,\nhowever, is closely circular, so the best evidence is that the outer edge is not affected by\neither type of asymmetry, hence there is a near zero offset between the geometric center and\nthe site of the explosion. This conclusion will have some 1\u03c3 uncertainty attached to it, and\nwe take this to be close to the RMS variation in the outer radius of the remnant, which is\n5% of the radius of the SNR (i.e., 0.9\u2032\u2032 ). When combined with the measured position of the\ngeometric center, we get the position of the explosion with an uncertainty of 0.9\u2032\u2032 added in\nquadrature with 0.9\u2032\u2032 , to get a radius for the error circle of 1.3\u2032\u2032 .\nThe position of any ex-companion star will be offset from the explosion site due to the\nproper motion of the star. The orbital velocity of the companion will depend on its mass\nand size (because it is filling its Roche lobe). The kick velocity onto the companion will be\nperpendicular to the orbital velocity, and will depend substantially on the size and closeness\nof the companion. These effects have been calculated by Marietta et al. (2000), Canal et\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nal. (2001), Pan et al. (2010), and Schaefer & Pagnotta (2012). For red giant and subgiant\ncompanions, the orbital velocities and kick velocities will be relatively small, 100 and 250\nkm s\u22121 respectively. For main sequence companion stars, it is critical to realize that all\nmodels require the star to be more massive than 1.16 M\u2299 , as this is the limit required to\ndrive fast accretion onto the white dwarf (Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012; Langer et al. 2000).\nWith this limit on the mass, the orbital velocity (relative to the WD) plus the kick velocity\nrequire the relative space velocity of any main sequence progenitor companion to be 390 km\ns\u22121 or less. For a distance modulus to the LMC of 18.50\u00b10.10 mag (Freedman et al. 2001;\nSchaefer 2008), a velocity of 390 km s\u22121 over a time interval of 600\u00b1200 years corresponds to\na maximum proper motion of 1.0\u00b10.3\u2032\u2032 . The proper motion will be 0.25\u00b10.08\u2032\u2032 and 0.6\u00b10.2\u2032\u2032\nfor red giants and subgiants, respectively.\nThe size of the final error circle depends on the class of the companion and the confidence\nlevel required to be contained within the circle. The distribution of the uncertainties for the\ngeometric center and the offset to the explosion site are Gaussian, but the distribution for the\nproper motion is edge dominated, so a convolution is needed to express the final distribution\nfor the position of any ex-companion. We report the error circle radii for which 99.73% (i.e.,\n3\u03c3) of the ex-companion stars will be contained. We calculate that for the minimal mass\nmain sequence star, the 99.73% error radius is 4.7\u2032\u2032 . For subgiants and red giants, the error\ncircles are 4.5\u2032\u2032 and 4.3\u2032\u2032 respectively.\n\n3.\n\nContents of the Central Region\n\nWe have just two bands for our HST images, V (F550M) and H\u03b1 (F658N). For each of\nthe stars in the two images, we have performed aperture photometry with the standard HST\nzeros. The limiting magnitude is V=26.05 to the 5\u03c3 detection threshold. We calculate a nonstandard color, V \u2212 H\u03b1. For all 127 stars within the 4.7\u2032\u2032 error radius, we have tabulated the\nHST astrometry and photometry in Table 2. We have added two stars of interest outside the\nerror circle. Table 2 is presented in the printed journal with only the top ten lines displayed,\nso we have placed the brightest star in the circle (ID=1), the nearest red giant (ID=RG,\noutside the circle), and the nearest possible subgiant star (ID=SG, outside the circle) at the\ntop of the list, with the remainder of the stars listed in order of their angular distance from\nthe center (\u0398). The full table is available in the online version of this manuscript.\nWe have constructed a color-magnitude diagram with the V and V \u2212 H\u03b1 magnitudes. This can be converted to an HR diagram with the distance modulus to the LMC\nof 18.50\u00b10.10. Unfortunately, this HR diagram uses nonstandard colors, as this is all that is\ncurrently available from HST. The wavelength separation between the two bands is not as\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nlarge as desired, and this makes for relatively small separation between subgiants and main\nsequence stars. The exposure times (12.5 minutes in V and 79 minutes in H\u03b1) along with\nthe narrow bandpass for H\u03b1 make for relatively poor photon statistics at the faint end. Nevertheless, the HST HR diagram for SNR 0519-69.0 shows a clear main sequence, red clump,\nand red giant branch. This allows for simple identification of each star by its luminosity\nclass. As always, there are difficulties with distinguishing subgiant stars positioned near the\nmain sequence, and we expect that ordinary measurement errors will shift some of the many\nmain sequence stars out towards the subgiant region on the HR diagram.\nThe contents of the central region include 127 stars, of which 27 are main sequence stars\nbrighter than V=22.7. Schaefer & Pagnotta (2012) have pointed out that such stars could be\nex-companion stars for the supersoft source progenitor model. Thus, there are 27 candidate\nex-companion stars. The other 100 stars in the central region are main sequence stars that\nare fainter than the required V=22.7, therefore not possible ex-companions. Importantly,\nthe stars in the central region do not include any post-main-sequence stars. That is, there\nare no red giants or subgiants within the 4.7\u2032\u2032 error circle. The nearest red giant and subgiant\nare 6.0\u2032\u2032 and 7.4\u2032\u2032 from the center, respectively. There is no chance for any progenitor model\nthat has a red giant or subgiant donor star.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe detection or exclusion of ex-companion stars near the center of Type Ia supernova\nremnants can provide decisive information about the progenitor. For SNR 0519-69.0, the\n99.73% error circle contains no post-main sequence stars, which eliminates the symbiotic,\nrecurrent nova, helium star, and spin-up/spin-down progenitor models. Among the published\nsingle-degenerate models, only the supersoft source model is possible for SNR 0519-69.0. A\ndouble-degenerate system has no ex-companion star, so this model is also fully consistent\nwith our images. Thus, for SNR 0519-69.0, the only possible progenitors are a supersoft\nsource or a double-degenerate.\nWe note that Badenes et al. (2007) have examined SNR 0519-69.0 for evidence of a\nlarge cavity in the circumstellar region that would be carved out by fast, optically thick\noutflows that occur in the accretion wind scenario proposed for supersoft sources (Hachisu\net al. 1996). They found that the dynamics of the ejecta from SNR 0519-69.0 are inconsistent\nwith the predictions. If the accretion wind scenario is in fact the only possible method for\nobtaining a Ia from a supersoft source, then the lack of a cavity excludes the supersoft source\nprogenitor class for SNR 0519-69.0 and we would be left with the double-degenerate model\nas the only viable progenitor. Like SNR 0509-67.5, which has been shown to be a double-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndegenerate, SNR 0519-69.0 also comes from a region with a low star formation history, which\nslightly favors a delayed progenitor (Badenes et al. 2009).\nSNR 0509-67.5 already has a decisive result, where the entire central region is empty\nof any point source to V=26.9 (MV =+8.4), so that all published single-degenerate models\nare eliminated, and only the double-degenerate model remains. While the SNR 0519-69.0\nlimits are not as tight (because the supernova is older and the remnant is in an area with\nmuch higher star density), nevertheless the result is important as it rules out all but two\npossible progenitor classes for this particular supernova, the supersoft sources and the doubledegenerates.\nThe National Science Foundation supported this work through the REU Site in Physics\n& Astronomy (NSF grant 10-04822) at Louisiana State University and through grant AST\n11-09420.\n\nREFERENCES\nBadenes, C., Hughes, J.

The center of this\nregion is calculated from the entire edge of the shell as viewed in H\u03b1 and X-ray light. Note\nthat the northeast quadrant of the shell has a faint circular arc outside the prominent arc\ncutting across the inside of the remnant. Any ex-companion star can be offset from the\ncenter due to its original orbital velocity, a kick from the supernova, and ordinary measurement uncertainties in positioning the center, with a 4.7\u2032\u2032 radius circle containing all possible\nex-companions at the 99.73% containment probability level. This central region contains 27\nmain sequence stars brighter than V = 22.7, and any one of these could be an ex-companion\nstar from a supersoft source progenitor system. The central region does not contain any\nred giants or subgiants, and this eliminates all the single-degenerate models (including the\nsymbiotic, recurrent nova, helium donor star, and spin-up/spin-down models) that require a\npost-main sequence companion. Only two published models remain, so the Type Ia supernova that created SNR 0519-69.0 must have come from either a double-degenerate system\nor a supersoft source. The star marked 1 is the brightest main sequence star in the central\nregion, and the nearest red giant and subgiant (both outside the central region) are labeled\nRG and SG, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nTable 2.
