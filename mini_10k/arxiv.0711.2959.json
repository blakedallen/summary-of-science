GOODWIN AND GERHARD R\u00d6HRLE\nAbstract. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over Fq , where q is a\npower of a prime p that is good for G. Let F be the Frobenius morphism associated with\nthe Fq -structure on G and set G = GF , the fixed point subgroup of F . Let P be an F -stable\nparabolic subgroup of G and let U be the unipotent radical of P; set P = PF and U = UF .\nLet Guni be the set of unipotent elements in G. In this note we show that the number of\nconjugacy classes of U in Guni is given by a polynomial in q with integer coefficients.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet Un (q) be the subgroup of GLn (q) consisting of upper unitriangular matrices, where q\nis a power of a prime. A longstanding conjecture attributed to G. Higman (cf. [7]) states\nthat the number of conjugacy classes of Un (q) for fixed n is a polynomial in q with integer\ncoefficients. This conjecture has been verified for n \u2264 13 by computer calculation in work of\nA. Vera-Lopez and J. M. Arregi, see [21]. There has been much interest in this conjecture,\nfor example from G.R. Robinson [17] and J. Thompson [20].\nIn [1] J. Alperin showed that a related question is easily answered, namely that the number\nof Un (q)-conjugacy classes in all of GLn (q) is a polynomial in q with integer coefficients. In [5]\nthe authors generalized Alperin's result twofold, by replacing GLn (q) by a finite group of Lie\ntype G and by replacing Un (q) by the unipotent radical U an arbitrary parabolic subgroup\nP of G. Precisely, in [5, Thm. 4.5], under the assumptions that the reductive algebraic group\nG corresponding to G has connected centre and that q is a power of a good prime for G,\nwe showed that, the number k(U, G) of U-conjugacy classes in G is a polynomial in q with\ninteger coefficients (if G has a simple component of type E8 , then there exist polynomials\nmi (z) \u2208 Z[z] for i = \u00b11 so that k(U, G) = mi (q), when q is congruent i modulo 3).\nUsing the machinery developed in [5], we discuss the following related conjugacy problem\nin this note: we show that the number k(U, Guni ) of U-conjugacy classes in the set Guni of\nunipotent elements of G is a polynomial in q with integer coefficients (again, if G has a simple\ncomponent of type E8 , then two polynomials are required depending on the congruence class\nof q modulo 3); see Theorem 3.6 for a precise statement. For this theorem we do not\nrequire the assumption that the centre of G is connected; this is because U and Guni are\n\"independent\" up to isomorphism of the isogeny class of G.\nOne can view Alperin's result in [1] and Theorem 3.6 for G = GLn (q) and U = Un (q)\nas evidence in support of Higman's conjecture. In [1] Alperin remarks that it is unlikely to\nbe possible to obtain a proof of Higman's conjecture by descent from his theorem; it seems\nequally improbable that a proof of this conjecture can be deduced from Theorem 3.6.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 20G40, 20E45, Secondary 20D20.\n1\n\n\fAs general references on finite groups of Lie type, we refer the reader to the books by\nCarter [2] and Digne\u2013Michel [3].\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. General notation for algebraic groups. We introduce some notation used throughout. Let q be a power of a prime p. By Fq we denote the field of q elements and by Fq\nits algebraic closure. Throughout this paper, we identify algebraic groups defined over Fq\nwith their group of Fq -rational points. So in particular, the additive group Ga and the mul\u2217\ntiplicative group Gm are identified with the additive group Fq and multiplicative group Fq\nrespectively.\nLet G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over Fq , where p is assumed to be\ngood for G. Let F be the Frobenius morphism associated with the Fq -structure on G and\nset G = GF the finite group of fixed points of F in G.\nLet H be a closed F -stable subgroup of G. We write H\u25e6 for the identity component of H,\nHuni for the subset of unipotent elements in H and H = HF . By |H|p we denote the size of\na Sylow p-subgroup of H and by |H|p\u2032 the p\u2032 -part of the order of H. Let S be an H-stable\nsubset of G. We write k(H, S) for the number of H-conjugacy classes in S. Given x \u2208 G\nwe write CH (x) for the centralizer of x in H and CH (x) for the centralizer of x in H; for\nx \u2208 H, then we write CS (x) for the set of fixed points of x in S. The H-conjugacy class of\nx is denoted by H * x. We write\nfHG (x) = |{g H | x \u2208 g H, g \u2208 G}|\nfor the number of conjugates of H in G containing x.\n2.2. Axiomatic setup for connected reductive algebraic groups. For the statement\nof our main theorem (Theorem 3.6) we require the axiomatic setup for connected reductive\nalgebraic groups given in [5, \u00a72.2], which we now recall for completeness and convenience.\nThe idea is that a tuple of combinatorial objects is used to define a family of connected\nreductive groups indexed by prime powers. We refer the reader to [3, \u00a70, \u00a73] for some of the\nresults used below.\nLet \u03a8 = (X, \u03a6, X\u030c, \u03a6\u030c) be a root datum. Then given a finite field Fq , the root datum \u03a8\ndetermines a connected reductive algebraic group G over Fq and a maximal torus T of G\nsuch that \u03a8 is the root datum of G with respect to T. Let \u03a0 be a base for \u03a6; this determines\na Borel subgroup B of G containing T.\nLet F0 : X \u2192 X be an automorphism of finite order such that F0 (\u03a6) = \u03a6, F0 (\u03a0) = \u03a0\nand F0\u2217 (\u03a6\u030c) = \u03a6\u030c. Then for any prime power q, the automorphism F0 defines a Frobenius\nmorphism F : G \u2192 G such that the induced action of F on X is given by q * F0 . Further,\nB and T are F -stable, so that T is a maximally split maximal torus of G.\nA subset J of \u03a0 determines the standard parabolic subgroup P = PJ of G. If F0 (J) = J,\nq is a prime power and F is the corresponding Frobenius morphism of G, then P is F -stable.\nSumming up, the discussion above implies that the quadruple \u2206 = (\u03a8, \u03a0, F0 , J), along\nwith a prime power q determines:\n\u2022 a connected reductive algebraic group G defined over Fq with corresponding Frobenius morphism F ;\n\u2022 a maximally split F -stable maximal torus T;\n\u2022 an F -stable Borel subgroup B \u2287 T of G; and\n2\n\n\f\u2022 an F -stable parabolic subgroup P \u2287 B.\nThe notation we use for G, B, T and P does not reflect the fact that their Fq -structure\ndepends on the choice of a prime power q. Let q be a prime power and m a positive integer,\nwrite F for the Frobenius morphism corresponding to q. Then it is not necessarily the case\nthat the Frobenius morphism corresponding to the prime power q m is F m , i.e. the definition\nof G over Fqm is not necessarily obtained from the Fq -structure by extending scalars. The\ndefinitions of G over Fqm are not equivalent if F0 is not the identity and there is a common\ndivisor of m and the order F0 . However, in order to keep the notation short, we choose not\nto show this dependence on q. We refer the reader to [5, Rem. 2.1] for further explanation\nof our convention for varying q.\nGiven the data \u2206 = (\u03a8, \u03a0, F0 , J) and prime power q, we note that the unipotent radical\nU = Ru (P) of P = PJ and the unique Levi subgroup L = LJ of P containing T are\ndetermined. Since both P and T are F -stable, so are U and L.\n2.3. Commuting varieties. Let H and S be a closed subgroup and a closed H-stable\nsubvariety of G, respectively. The commuting variety of H and S is the closed subvariety of\nH \u00d7 S defined by\nC(H, S) = {(h, s) \u2208 H \u00d7 S | hs = sh}.\nAssume that both H and S are F -stable. Then F acts on C(H, S) and we have C(H, S)F =\nC(HF , SF ) = C(H, S). The Burnside counting formula gives\nX\n(2.1)\n|C(H, S)| =\n|CS (x)| = |H| * k(H, S).\nx\u2208H\n\n2.4. Kempf\u2013Rousseau theory. We now briefly recall the theory of optimal cocharacters\nfrom geometric invariant theory. We require this in the proof of Proposition 3.2, which is\nkey to the proof of Theorem 3.6.\nLet X\u030c(G) denote the set of cocharacters of G, i.e., the set of homomorphisms Gm \u2192 G.\nThere is a left action of G on X\u030c(G): for \u03bc \u2208 X\u030c(G) and g \u2208 G we define g * \u03bc \u2208 X\u030c(G) by\n(g * \u03bc)(t) = g\u03bc(t)g \u22121.\nLet X be an affine variety. Let \u03c6 : Gm \u2192 X be a morphism of algebraic varieties. We\nsay that lim \u03c6(t) exists if there exists a morphism \u03c6b : Ga \u2192 X (necessarily unique) whose\nt\u21920\n\nb\nrestriction to Gm is \u03c6; if this limit exists, then we set lim \u03c6(t) = \u03c6(0).\nt\u21920\nLet P be a parabolic subgroup of G, and let L be a Levi subgroup of P. We recall, see\nfor example [19, Prop. 8.4.5], that there exists \u03bb \u2208 X\u030c(G) such that: P = P\u03bb := {g \u2208 G |\nlim \u03bb(t)g\u03bb(t)\u22121 exists}; L = L\u03bb := CG (\u03bb(Gm )); and Ru (P) = {g \u2208 G | lim \u03bb(t)g\u03bb(t)\u22121 = 1}.\nt\u21920\n\nt\u21920\n\nMoreover, the map c\u03bb : P\u03bb \u2192 L\u03bb given by g 7\u2192 lim \u03bb(t)g\u03bb(t)\u22121 is a homomorphism of\nt\u21920\n\nalgebraic groups with kernel ker c\u03bb = Ru (P); we note that c\u03bb is simply the projection from\nP onto L along the semidirect decomposition P = LRu (P).\nLet G act on the affine variety X. For x \u2208 X let G * x denote the G-orbit of x in X and\nCG (x) the stabilizer of x in G. Let x \u2208 X and let C be the unique closed orbit in the closure\nof G * x, we refer the reader to [15, 1.3] for a proof that there is a unique closed G-orbit in\nG * x. The Kempf\u2013Rousseau theory tells us that there exists a non-empty subset \u03a9(x) of\nX\u030c(G) consisting of so called optimal cocharacters \u03bb such that lim \u03bb(t) * x exists and belongs\nt\u21920\n\nto C, we refer the reader to [9] or [16] for information on the Kempf\u2013Rousseau theory and\n3\n\n\fthe definition of optimal cocharacters. Moreover, there exists a parabolic subgroup P(x) of\nG so that P(x) = P\u03bb for every \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9(x), and we have that \u03a9(x) is a single P(x)-orbit.\nFurther, for every g \u2208 G, we have \u03a9(g * x) = g * \u03a9(x) and P(g * x) = gP(x)g \u22121. In particular,\nCG (x) \u2264 P(x). The parabolic subgroup P(x) is called the optimal or destabilizing parabolic\nsubgroup associated to x.\nRemark 2.2. Suppose that G, X and the action of G on X are all defined over Fq and\nlet F denote the Frobenius morphism associated with the Fq -structures on both G and X.\nThere is an action of F on X\u030c(G) as follows: for \u03bc \u2208 X\u030c(G) we define F * \u03bc \u2208 X\u030c(G) by\n(F * \u03bc)(t) = F (\u03bc(F \u22121(t))), where F : Gm \u2192 Gm is given by F (t) = tq , see [9, \u00a74]. Thanks to\n[9, Thm. 4.2] and [10, \u00a72], if x is fixed by F , then both \u03a9(x) and P(x) are F -stable.\n3. Polynomial behaviour of k(U, Guni )\nWe maintain the notation and assumptions made in the previous sections. In particular,\nG is a connected reductive algebraic group defined over Fq , where q is a power of the prime\np which is good for G.\nWe begin by stating a counting lemma for finite groups from [1], see also [5, Lem. 4.1];\nthe argument used to prove [5, Lem. 4.1], which uses the Burnside counting lemma, easily\ngeneralizes to the present situation, so we do not include it here.\nLemma 3.1. Let P = LU be an F -stable parabolic subgroup of G. Then the number of\nU-conjugacy classes in Guni is given by\nX |CG (x)uni |\nk(U, Guni ) = |L|\nfUG (x),\n|C\n(x)|\nG\nx\u2208R\n\nwhere R is a set of representatives of the unipotent G-conjugacy classes.\n\nArmed with the theory of optimal cocharacters from \u00a72.4, we are able to provide the\nfollowing key result for our proof that k(U, Guni ) is a polynomial in q. We note that the\nLevi decomposition of CG (u) stated in Proposition 3.2(i) is well-known, see for example [13,\nThm. A].\nProposition 3.2. Let u \u2208 Guni . Then\n(i) CG (u) admits a Levi decomposition CG (u) = C(u)R(u) with C(u) \u2229 R(u) = {1},\nC(u) reductive and R(u) the unipotent radical of CG (u), such that C(u) is F -stable;\ntherefore, setting C(u) = C(u)F and R(u) = R(u)F , we obtain a Levi decomposition\nCG (u) = C(u)R(u) of CG (u);\n(ii) both CG (u)uni and CG (u)uni admit a \"Levi decomposition\", CG (u)uni = C(u)uni R(u)\nand CG (u)uni = C(u)uni R(u).\nProof. (i). Since p is good for G, the centralizer of u in G has a Levi decomposition, CG (u) =\nC(u)R(u) with C(u) reductive and R(u) the unipotent radical of CG (u), see for example\n[13, Thm. A]. More precisely, by [13, Thm. 2.1; Prop. 2.5], let P(u) be the destabilizing\nparabolic subgroup associated to u, then as explained in \u00a72.4, we have CG (u) \u2286 P(u). Let\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a9(u) be an optimal cocharacter of G associated to u. We have P(u) = P\u03bb = L\u03bb U(u),\nwhere U(u) = Ru (P(u)). Setting C(u) = L\u03bb \u2229 CG (u) and R(u) = U(u) \u2229 CG (u), we obtain\na Levi decomposition CG (u) = C(u)R(u) of CG (u).\n4\n\n\fBy Remark 2.2, both \u03a9(u) and P(u) are F -stable, since u \u2208 G. Further, \u03a9(u) is a single\nP(u)-orbit. Since P(u) is connected and F -stable, it follows, from for example [3, Cor. 3.12],\nthat there exists an F -stable cocharacter in \u03a9(u). We may therefore assume that \u03bb is F stable. Then C(u) is F -stable. Clearly, R(u) is also F -stable. Since C(u) \u2229 R(u) = {1}, it\nfollows that CG (u) = CG (u)F = C(u)F R(u)F = C(u)R(u).\n(ii). Let v \u2208 CG (u) be unipotent. Thanks to the Levi decomposition CG (u) = C(u)R(u) \u2286\nP(u) of CG (u) from part (i), we have v = xy with x \u2208 C(u) and y \u2208 R(u). We have\nx = c\u03bb (v) where c\u03bb : P(u) \u2192 L\u03bb is the canonical homomorphism defined in \u00a72.4. Therefore,\nx is unipotent and we obtain the decomposition CG (u)uni = C(u)uni R(u).\nSince C(u)uni \u2229 R(u) = {1}, it follows that CG (u)uni = CG (u)Funi = C(u)Funi R(u)F =\nC(u)uni R(u), as desired.\n\u0003\nNext we require a result regarding the independence in q of the orders of centralizers of\nunipotent elements in G; more precisely that these orders are given by a polynomial in q. We\nuse the axiomatic setup from \u00a72.2 to achieve this. Fix (\u03a8, \u03a0, F0 ), where \u03a8 = (X, \u03a6, X\u030c, \u03a6\u030c),\nand for a prime power q, let G and F be the connected reductive group and Frobenius\nmorphism determined by (\u03a8, \u03a0, F0) and q. We assume that X/Z\u03a6 is torsion free, where Z\u03a6\ndenotes the root lattice of G, this ensures that the centre of G is connected for all q. We\nalso assume that q is a power of a good prime for G.\nUnder these assumptions the parametrization of the unipotent conjugacy classes of G is\nindependent of q, see for example [5, Prop. 2.5]. We let R be a set of representatives of the\nunipotent conjugacy classes of G, and we use the convention of [5, Rem. 2.6] to vary u \u2208 R\nwith q. With these conventions we can state and prove the following proposition, which is\ncrucial for our proof of Theorem 3.6.\nProposition 3.3. Assume that X/Z\u03a6 is torsion free and that q is a power of a good prime\nfor G. Let u \u2208 R. Then the order of CG (u) is given by a polynomial in q. Further, the\norder of CG (u)uni is given by a fixed power of q.\nProof. That the order of CG (u) is a polynomial in q, can been seen from the Lusztig\u2013Shoji\nalgorithm for computing Green functions, see [12] and [18]. It is straightforward to see\nthat the order of the centralizers of unipotent elements of G can be determined from the\nblock-diagonal matrix \u039b, defined in [18, \u00a75]; the blocks are determined by the Springer\ncorrespondence. The (unknown) matrix \u039b satisfies the equation\n(3.4)\n\nt\n\nP \u039bP = \u03a0,\n\nwhere P is an (unknown) upper triangular block matrix with each diagonal block a matrix\nwith entries in Q, and \u03a0 is a known matrix with entries that are rational functions in q with\ncoefficients independent of q, see [18, (5.6)]. As stated in loc. cit., the matrix \u039b is uniquely\ndetermined by (3.4); moreover, one sees that the entries of \u039b are rational functions in q,\nwith coefficients independent of q. In particular, we can deduce that |CG (u)| is a rational\nfunction in q, and then a standard argument, see for example [5, Lem. 2.12], tells us that\n|CG (u)| is in fact a polynomial in q.\nThe second statement in the lemma now follows from Steinberg's formula applied to the\nLevi factor C(u) of CG (u), see for example [3, Cor. 9.5].\n\u0003\nRemark 3.5. It seems likely that a stronger result than Proposition 3.3 regarding the structure of CG (u) holds. That is the root datum corresponding to C(u)\u25e6 , the component group\n5\n\n\fA(u) of C(u), and the action of F on the root lattice for C(u)\u25e6 and A(u) do not depend\non q. It is known that the root datum of C(u) does not depend on q, though this is only\nby a case by case analysis, see for example the discussion at the end of [8, 5.11]. There is\na general proof that the structure of A(u) does not depend on q, see [11] or [13]. One then\nneeds to check that the action of F on C(u) for split elements u is independent of q; for G\nof type E8 one other case needs to be dealt with separately. Further one needs to know that\nthe action of A(u) on the set of simple roots of C(u)\u25e6 does not depend on q. We have chosen\nnot to pursue this here.\nWe are now in a position to prove the principal result of this paper, which is an analogue\nof [5, Thm. 4.5]. We continue to use the axiomatic setup from \u00a72.2.\nTheorem 3.6. Fix the data \u2206 = (\u03a8, \u03a0, F0 , J), where \u03a8 = (X, \u03a6, X\u030c, \u03a6\u030c). For a prime\npower q, let G, F and P be the connected reductive group, Frobenius morphism and F -stable\nparabolic subgroup of G determined by \u2206 and let U = Ru (P). Assume that q is power of a\ngood prime for G.\n(i) Suppose that G does not have a simple component of type E8 . Then there exists\nm(z) \u2208 Z[z] such that k(U, Guni ) = m(q).\n(ii) Suppose that G has a simple component of type E8 . Then there exist mi (z) \u2208 Z[z]\n(i = \u00b11), such that k(U, Guni ) = mi (q), when q is congruent to i modulo 3.\nProof. We begin by assuming that X/Z\u03a6 is torsion free, so that the centre of G is connected.\nWe write L for the Levi subgroup of P containing T.\nBy Lemma 3.1, we have\nX |CG (x)uni |\n(3.7)\nk(U, Guni ) = |L|\nfUG (x),\n|CG (x)|\nx\u2208R\n\nwhere R is a set of representatives of the unipotent G-classes. With the assumptions that\nX/Z\u03a6 is torsion free and that q is power of a good prime for G, it follows from [5, Prop.\n2.5] that the set R is independent of q, where we use the convention of [5, Rem. 2.6] to vary\nx with q.\nSince L is a finite reductive group, the factor |L| is a polynomial in q ([2, p. 75]). Thanks\nto [5, Lem. 3.1(ii), Thm. 3.10], each of the factors fUG (x) in the sum above is a polynomial in\nq, unless we are in case (ii) when fUG (x) is given by two polynomials depending on q modulo\n3. From Proposition 3.3 we have that |CG (x)| and |CG (x)uni | are polynomials in q. Hence,\nk(U, Guni ) is a rational function in q. Now by a standard argument, see for example [5, Lem.\n2.12], we can conclude that k(U, Guni ) is a polynomial function in q with rational coefficients.\nAssume now that G is split over Fq , i.e. that F0 is the identity. Thanks to (2.1),\n|C(U, Guni )F | is a polynomial in q with rational coefficients. The assumption that G is\nsplit means that |C(U, Guni )| gives the number of Fq -rational points in the variety C(U, Guni )\nviewed as a variety defined over Fp . Now using the Grothendieck trace formula (see [3, Thm.\n10.4]), one can prove that the coefficients of this polynomial are integers, see for example\n[14, Prop. 6.1].\nA further standard argument using the Grothendieck trace formula now tells us that the\neigenvalues of F on the l-adic cohomology groups of C(U, Guni ) are all powers of q, see for\nexample the proof of [14, Prop. 6.1]. Now assume that G is not split and let d be the order\nof F0 . Then arguments like those used to prove [5, Prop. 3.20] imply that the eigenvalues of\n6\n\n\fF on the l-adic cohomology groups of C(U, Guni ) (viewed as a variety defined over Fq ) are\nof the form \u03b6q m , where \u03b6 is a dth root of unity. Following the arguments to prove [5, Prop.\n3.20], one can now show that the coefficients of the polynomial |C(U, Guni )| are integers.\nThen using (2.1) again, it follows that k(U, Guni ) is a polynomial function in q with integer\ncoefficients.\nNow remove the assumption that X/Z\u03a6 is torsion free. Let \u03c3 : G \u2192 \u011c be an isogeny that\nis defined over Fq , where \u011c is a reductive group defined over Fq with connected centre. Then\n\u03c3 induces an isomorphism between U and \u00db and between Guni and \u011cuni , since Z(G) \u2229 U =\n{1} = Z(G) \u2229 Guni , where Z(G) is the centre of G. It follows easily that k(U, Guni ) =\nk(\u00db , \u011cuni ) is given by a polynomial in q with integer coefficients.\n\u0003\nRecall that two parabolic subgroups of G are called associated if they have Levi subgroups\nthat are conjugate in G. It was already remarked in [5, Cor. 3.5] that if P and Q are\nassociated parabolic subgroups of G with unipotent radicals U and V respectively, then the\nfunctions fUG and fVG are equal on unipotent elements of G. Therefore, from (3.7) we can\nobserve the following corollary in the same way as [5, Cor. 4.7].\nCorollary 3.8. Let P and Q be associated F -stable parabolic subgroups of G with unipotent\nradicals U and V respectively. Then\nk(U, Guni ) = k(V, Guni ).\nIn order to be able to compute the polynomials given in Theorem 3.6 explicitly, we reformulate the expression for k(U, Guni ) in (3.7) in terms of Green functions. Using [5, Lem.\n3.3], Proposition 3.2, and Steinberg's formula [3, Cor. 9.5], we obtain\n!\nX |CG (x)uni |\nX\n1\nk(U, Guni ) = |L|\n(\u22121)l(w) QG\nTw (x)\n|C\n(x)|\n|L|\n|W\n|\nG\np\nL\nx\u2208R\nw\u2208WL\n!\n1 |L| X |C(x)|2p X\n(3.9)\n(\u22121)l(w) QG\n=\nTw (x)\n|WL | |L|p x\u2208R |C(x)| w\u2208W\nL\n!\nX |C(x)|p\nX\n1\n(\u22121)l(w) QG\n=\n|L|p\u2032\nTw (x) ,\n\u2032\n|WL |\n|C(x)|\np\nx\u2208R\nw\u2208W\nL\n\nwhere C(x) is the reductive part of CG (x), as in Proposition 3.2(i), WL is the Weyl group of\nL; for w \u2208 WL we write Tw for the F -stable twisted torus associated with w \u2208 WL , and QG\nTw\nis the Green function associated with Tw . For more information on Green functions we refer\nthe reader to [2, \u00a77.6]. We note that the sum in (3.9) is effectively only over representatives\nof the G-orbits that meet U. This follows from the fact that the term fUG (x) in (3.7) is\nobviously zero if G * x \u2229 U = \u2205.\nUsing the chevie package in GAP3 ([4]) along with some code provided by M. Geck, it\nis possible to explicitly calculate the polynomials m(z) in Theorem 3.6 for G of small rank.\nWe illustrate this with some examples for the case G = GLn and P = B is a Borel subgroup\nof G.\nExample 3.10. In Table 1 below we give the polynomials for k(U, Guni ) in case G = GLn (q)\nand P = B is a Borel subgroup of G, for n = 2, . . . , 10. In this case we take U = Un (q) to\nbe the group of upper unitriangular matrices.\n7\n\n\fn\n\nk(Un (q), GLn (q)uni )\n\n2\n\n2q \u2212 1\n\n3\n\nq 3 + 3q 2 \u2212 3q\n\n4\n\nq 6 + 5q 4 \u2212 9q 2 + 4q\n\n5\n\nq 10 + 4q 7 + 4q 6 + 6q 5 \u2212 20q 4 \u2212 10q 3 + 21q 2 \u2212 4q \u2212 1\n\n6\n\nq 15 + 5q 11 \u2212 q 10 + 13q 9 \u2212 5q 8 + q 7 \u2212 20q 6 \u2212 44q 5 + 52q 4 + 25q 3 \u2212 31q 2 + 5q\n\n7\n\nq 21 + 6q 16 \u2212 q 15 \u2212 q 14 + 13q 13 + 22q 12 \u2212 41q 11 + 37q 10 \u2212 49q 9 \u2212 57q 8 \u2212 12q 7 +\n71q 6 + 139q 5 \u2212 120q 4 \u2212 51q 3 + 50q 2 \u2212 5q \u2212 1\n\n8\n\nq 28 +7q 22 \u2212q 21 \u2212q 20 \u2212q 19 +19q 18 +13q 17 +7q 16 \u221254q 15 +39q 14 +39q 13 \u2212125q 12 \u2212\n86q 11 \u2212 93q 10 + 225q 9 + 160q 8 + 102q 7 \u2212 164q 6 \u2212 322q 5 + 207q 4 + 87q 3 \u2212 64q 2 + 6q\n\n9\n\nq 36 + 8q 29 \u2212 q 28 \u2212 q 27 \u2212 q 26 \u2212 q 25 + 26q 24 + 19q 23 \u2212 44q 22 + 41q 21 + 9q 20 + 25q 19 \u2212\n119q 18 + 57q 17 \u2212 134q 16 + 119q 15 \u2212 458q 14 + 177q 13 + 290q 12 \u2212 121q 11 + 1315q 10 \u2212\n807q 9 \u2212 971q 8 + 60q 7 + 326q 6 + 568q 5 \u2212 319q 4 \u2212 145q 3 + 89q 2 \u2212 7q\n\n10 q 45 + 9q 37 \u2212 q 36 \u2212 q 35 \u2212 q 34 \u2212 q 33 \u2212 q 32 + 34q 31 + 26q 30 \u2212 54q 29 \u2212 8q 28 + 68q 27 \u2212\n41q 26 + 251q 25 \u2212 258q 24 \u2212 395q 23 + 474q 22 + 259q 21 \u2212 674q 20 \u2212 174q 19 + 126q 18 \u2212\n1384q 17 + 3300q 16 \u2212 1299q 15 \u2212 1227q 14 + 4050q 13 \u2212 2400q 12 \u2212 691q 11 \u2212 2676q 10 +\n944q 9 + 3298q 8 \u2212 808q 7 \u2212 293q 6 \u2212 1017q 5 + 455q 4 + 210q 3 \u2212 108q 2 + 8q\nTable 1. k(Un (q), GLn (q)uni )\nRemark 3.11. One can easily check that each polynomial k(Un (q), GLn (q)uni ) in Table 1 when\nexpressed as a polynomial in q \u2212 1 has all coefficients non-negative. One might conjecture\nthat indeed in general each of the polynomials satisfies k(U, Guni ) \u2208 N[q \u2212 1]. As stated in [5,\nRem. 4.13], this is also the case for each of the explicit examples of the polynomials k(U, G)\ncalculated in [5]. It would be interesting to know if there is a geometric explanation for these\npositivity phenomena.\nRemark 3.12. Let P be an F -stable parabolic subgroup of G. Clearly, we have\nX\nk(U, Guni ) =\nk(U, G * u),\nu\u2208R\n\nwhere R is a complete set of representatives of the unipotent G-conjugacy classes. By an\nanalogue of Lemma 3.1, we get\n!\nX X |CG (x) \u2229 G * u|\nk(U, Guni ) = |L|\nfUG (x) .\n|C\n(x)|\nG\nu\u2208R x\u2208R\n\nIt would be interesting to know whether each of the summands k(U, G * u) is a polynomial\nin q; this is the case if |CG (x) \u2229 G * u| is a polynomial in q for all x and u.\n\nRemark 3.13. Using arguments as in [6], it is possible to show that in case G = GLn , the\nnumber of P -conjugacy classes in Guni is given by a polynomial in q. As the details are\n8\n\n\ftechnical, we choose not to include them here. For arbitrary G and P it is not clear whether\nk(P, Guni ) is polynomial or even given by Polynomials On Residue Classes (PORC).\nAcknowledgments: This research was funded in part by EPSRC grant EP/D502381/1.\nWe are very grateful to M.
