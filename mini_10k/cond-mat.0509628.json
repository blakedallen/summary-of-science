For example, the parent compounds\nof the cuprate high Tc superconductors are essentially\nantiferromagnetic Mott insulators described by a twodimensional spin- 21 QHA [1]. Such a low-dimensional\nQHA system has not been fully solved quantum mechanically. Only in the large S limit has Haldane shown that\nthe lattice QHA can be described by the QNLSM [2].\nSince then, the QNLSM has become a good candidate for\nthe phenomenological description of the low-dimensional\nQHA at low temperatures for various S values[3, 4, 5].\nHowever, two crucial questions remain for the QNLSM\napproach: (1) Why are the predictions of QNLSM obtained in the large-S limit coincidentally consistent with\nexperimental data of the low energy QHA with small\nS values? and (2) What is the upper limit of the low\ntemperature for the reliability of QNLSM? These two\nquestions, along with other difficulties for the QNLSM,\nhave been addressed in some recent literatures[6]. But\nthey have not yet been satisfactorily solved in a simple,\nconsistent approach. In this Letter, with the topologically invariant spin variable path integral approach, we\nresolve these problems by deriving a QNLSM from the\nlattice QHA for arbitrary S values.\nLet us first briefly recall the large-S approach of the\nQNLSM. The partition function of a spin system is usually expressed in terms of the spin variable path integral\nas follows (in the unit ~ = kB = 1):\nZ = T re\u2212\u03b2H =\n\nZ\n\nD[\u03a9]e\n\nR\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\nd\u03c4 {iSA*\u03a9\u0307\u2212h\u03a9|H|\u03a9i}\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nR\u03b2\nwhere the first term in the exponent iS 0 d\u03c4 A * \u03a9\u0307 =\nR\u03b2\nd\n0 d\u03c4 h\u03a9| d\u03c4 |\u03a9i \u2261 iS\u03c9(\u03a9) is a topological Berry phase\n[7], and A is a U(1) monopole potential; |\u03a9i is a spin\ncoherent state while \u03a9 is a unit vector along which the\nspin operator with spin quantum number S is maximally\naligned in |\u03a9i. For the lattice Heisenberg model (HM),\n\nH =J\n\nP\n\nZH =\n\n<ij>\n\nZ\n\nSi * Sj (J > 0), Eq.(1) becomes\n\nD[\u03a9i ]e\n\nR\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\nd\u03c4 {iS\n\nP\n\ni\n\nAi *\u03a9\u0307i \u2212JS 2\n\nP\n\n<ij>\n\n\u03a9i *\u03a9j }\n\n. (2)\n\nP\nBy minimizing H(\u03a9) = JS 2 <ij> \u03a9i * \u03a9j , one can\nfind the classical ground state (N\u00e9el state) which spontaneously breaks the SO(3) symmetry. Then by expanding\nthe action around the ground state, the spin-wave theory\n(SWT) of HM, which describes the long wavelength spin\nmodes[8], can be easily derived.\nBut, according to the Mermin-Wagner's theorem[9], no\nsymmetry can be spontaneously broken in one- or twodimensional HM for a finite T (> 0). To derive an effective long wavelength action that retains the full spin rotational symmetry, Haldane considered the large-S limit.\nIn the large-S limit, the path integrals of Eq.(2) are\ndominated by the semiclassical equation: iS\u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0307 =\n\u2202H[\u03a9]\n\u2202\u03a9 . By separating the semiclassical solution \u03a9i into\na slowly varying N\u00e9el order unit vector (\u22121)i n(xi ) plus\na slowly varying magnetization density field perpendicular to n(xi ) (Haldane's mapping), and then taking the\ncontinuous limit and integrating out the magnetic density\nfield, Haldane shows that Eq.(2) is reduced to a QNLSM,\n\nZH =\n\nZ\n\nd\u22121\n\nD[n] ei2\u03c0S\u0398[n] e\u2212(\u039b\n\n/2g0 )\n\nR\n\ndd+1 x \u2202\u03bc n\u2202 \u03bc n\n\n, (3)\n\n1\ndefined in the d+1-dimensional space\n\u221a (x , * * * ,\nd+1\n1\nd\nx )=(x , * * * , x , co \u03c4 ). Where, go =\u221a2 d/S is a dimensionless coupling constant, co = 2 dJSa the spin\nwave velocity and \u039b = a\u22121 the inverse of the lattice\nspacing. The imaginary time (temperature) variable \u03c4\nranges from 0 to \u03b2 = 1/T . The exponent \u0398[n] in Eq.(3)\nis a topological factor associated with the Berry phase.\nHowever, as we will elaborate, the derivation of the\nQNLSM based on the large-S expansion should be improved from the very beginning. As a long-standing\nproblem in the construction of generalized phase space\npath integrals[10], the Eq.(1) is not well defined. The\n\n\f2\nmain problem arises from the assumption, used in deriving Eq.(1), that |\u03a9(\u03c4 + \u03b4\u03c4 )i \u2212 |\u03a9(\u03c4 )i is of order O(\u03b4\u03c4 ).\nAlthough this assumption has been widely used in the\napplication of generalized phase space path integrals, it\nhas never been justified[10]. In fact, in effective field theories, there always exist simultaneous rapidly and slowly\nvarying paths in the path integral formalism that are associated with short and long range quantum fluctuations,\nrespectively. The effective action for slowly varying motions can be properly obtained by integrating over short\nrange quantum fluctuations[11]. However, in Eq.(1), only\nslowly varying motions are retained; the short range\nquantum fluctuations have been simply ignored.\nTo overcome the shortcomings involved in the derivation of Eq.(1), we begin with the discrete form of the partition function obtained exactly from the coherent state\nrepresentation[12]:\nZ = lim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nN\nY\n\nk=1\n\nd\u03bc(\u03a9k ) exp{\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u2212\u01eb\n\nlnh\u03a9k |\u03a9k\u22121 i\n\nh\u03a9k |H|\u03a9k\u22121 i\n},\nh\u03a9k |\u03a9k\u22121 i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |\u03a9N i = |\u03a90 i because of the periodicity of the\ntrace), \u01eb = \u03b2/N is infinitesimal as N \u2192 \u221e. The\nslowly varying motion means that |\u03a9i i \u2212 |\u03a9i\u22121 i varies\nsmoothly in the interval \u01eb such that it can be written\nas a time derivative \u01eb|\u03a9\u0307i. The rapidly varying motion of\n|\u03a9i i\u2212|\u03a9i\u22121 i in the interval \u01eb is related to the short range\nquantum fluctuations, we label it as \u03b4\u03a9. The assumption\nof |\u03a9k i\u2212 |\u03a9k\u22121 i being of order 0(\u01eb) only keeps the slowly\nvarying motions \u03a9\u0307, while the short range fluctuations \u03b4\u03a9\nis ignored. Thus, the continuous-time limit of (4) results\nin the conventional spin variable path integral of Eq.(1).\nTo include the contribution of the short range fluctuations, one should expand the nearby coherent state\noverlap to the second order terms that either are exclusively slowly varying motions or include at least one\nrapidly varying motion. The topologically invariant\nPN\nterms limN \u2192\u221e k=1 lnh\u03a9k |\u03a9k\u22121 i can then be uniquely\nexpressed by\nZ \u03b2 n\no\n1\nS\nd\u03c4 iA * \u03a9\u0307 + i\u03a9 * (\u03a9\u0307 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03a9) \u2212 \u03b4\u03a9 * \u03b4\u03a9 , (5)\n\u03c4\u039b\n0\nwhere the parameter \u03c4\u039b \u2261 1/T\u039b is an intrinsic shortest time scale (an upper limit of low temperature) for\ndistinguishing the slowly varying and rapidly varying\nmotions. We will later discuss this timescale in detail. The second and third terms in Eq.(5) are usually\nignored in the conventional derivation of phase space\npath integrals. For the Hamiltonian term in Eq.(4),\nP\nh\u03a9k |H|\u03a9k\u22121 i\nlimN \u2192\u221e N\nk=1 \u01eb h\u03a9k |\u03a9k\u22121 i , since it is already proportional to \u01eb, we only keep the off-diagonal expansion up\nto the quadratic order of \u03b4\u03a9:\nZ\no\nn\n\u2202 2 H[\u03a9]\n\u2202H[\u03a9]\n\u03b4\u03a9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03a9\u03b1\u2032 , (6)\n* \u03b4\u03a9 +\nd\u03c4 H[\u03a9] +\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03a9\u03b1 \u2202\u03a9\u03b1\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 are indices of spin components. Substituting\nEqs.(5-6) into Eq.(4), one gets\nZ\nZ \u03b2 n\nZ =\nD[\u03a9]D[\u03b4\u03a9] exp\nd\u03c4 iSA * \u03a9\u0307 \u2212 H[\u03a9]\n0\n\n\u2202H[\u03a9] i\n* \u03b4\u03a9\n+ iS\u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0307 \u2212\n\u2202\u03a9\nhS\no\n\u2202 2 H[\u03a9] i\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 +\n\u2212\n\u03b4\u03a9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03a9\u03b1\u2032 , (7)\n\u03c4\u039b\n\u2202\u03a9\u03b1 \u2202\u03a9\u03b1\u2032\nh\n\nwhich describes both the slowly varying motion \u03a9\u0307 and\nthe short range fluctuations \u03b4\u03a9.\nIf one takes the semiclassical limit, iS\u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0307 \u2212 \u2202H[\u03a9]\n\u2202\u03a9 =\n0, Eq.(7) is simply a variation expansion of the path integral (1) with respect to the semiclassical dynamics Haldane used[2], except for the geometrical term \u03c4S\u039b which\ncannot appear in Haldane's mapping. However, we must\nemphasize that Eq.(7) is derived by carefully treating the\noff-diagonal elements of nearby coherent states in Eq.(4)\nin terms of the short range fluctuation \u03b4\u03a9 and the slowly\nvarying motions \u03a9\u0307. Since there is no semiclassical expansion to begin with, it is not necessary to take the semiclassical limit by letting the second term vanish. Instead,\none can integrate out the short range fluctuations \u03b4\u03a9 and\nobtain a low energy effective action for the long wavelength spin modes. Since no semiclassical approximation\nis made in this procedure, the resulting long wavelength\neffective action should be valid for arbitrary S values.\nNext, we apply Eq.(7) to the HM. To specify the antiferromagnetic ordering, let the slowly varying \u03a9i =\n(\u22121)i n(xi ), here the Ne\u00e9l order n(xi ) is a unit vector\n|n(x\nR1. dThen, by taking the space continuous limit\nP i )| =\n1\nd x where a is the lattice spacing:\ni \u2192 ad\nX\n\u03a9i * \u03a9j\nH[\u03a9] = JS 2\n<ij>\n\n\u2192 \u2212dJS 2 N +\n\nJS 2\n2ad\u22122\n\nZ\n\ndd x\n\nd\nX\n\nk=1\n\n[\u2202k n(x) * \u2202k n(x)],\n\n(8)\n\n\u2202H[\u03a9]\n* \u03b4\u03a9 \u2192 0,\n(9)\n\u2202\u03a9\nZ\n\u2202 2 H[\u03a9]\n2dJS 2\n\u03b4\u03a9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03a9\u03b2 \u2192\ndd x\u03b4\u03a9(x) * \u03b4\u03a9(x).

This reproduces the large-S QNLSM. The\ndifference between (3) and (11) primarily comes from\nthe contribution of the short range fluctuations, the\n1/\u03c4\u039b = T\u039b term in (7) which cannot be included in Haldane's mapping [2]. However, this term plays an important role in the derivation of a consistent semiclassical\ndynamics[13]. Indeed, T\u039b is an upper limit of the low\ntemperature scale for the reliability of the QNLSM. Usually one assumes that there should be no intrinsic cutoff for the imaginary time variable \u03c4 because quantum\nfluctuations exist on all time scales in path integrals[3].\nBut a low energy effective theory constructed from path\nintegral is defined by integrating over high energy quantum fluctuations above certain energy scale[11]. Without\nsuch an intrinsic cutoff, namely, let \u03c4\u039b \u2192 0 (T\u039b \u2192 \u221e),\nEq.(11) reduces to\nZ\nio\nn \u03c1 Z\ns\ndd x |\u2207x n|2 ,\nZH \u221d D[n] ei2\u03c0S\u0398[n] exp \u2212\n2T\n(13)\nwhere \u03c1s = JS 2 a2\u2212d is the spin stiffness. Except for\nthe topological phase, this is the classical d-dimensional\nNLSM rather than a quantum d + 1-dimensional NLSM\nthat Haldane obtained[2]. This is because in the limit\n\u03c4\u039b \u2192 0, the strong canonical fluctuation in Eq.(5) smears\nthe dynamical fluctuation of Eq.(10) so that only the\nclassical Hamiltonian Eq.(8) remains.\nNow, let us discuss how to consistently determine this\ntimescale. The lattice spacing a indicates the existence\nof an intrinsic momentum \u221a\ncutoff \u039b in the d-dimensional\nmomentum space: \u039b = 2 \u03c0[\u0393(d/2 + 1)]1/d /a \u2261 L/a.\nUsing the energy-momentum relation of the spin wave,\nE = cs k, one can find the intrinsic energy cutoff (the\ninverse of the shortest time scale \u03c4\u039b ) T\u039b = cs \u039b/2\u03c0[8].\nCombined with (12), we get\nr\n16\u03c0 2 d \u0011\nSL2 \u0010\nT\u039b\n1\n+\n=\n1\n+\n.\n(14)\nJ\n4\u03c0 2\nL2\n\u221a\nFor d = 2 and S = 1/2, we have L = 2 \u03c0 and thus\nT\u039b /J \u2243 0.97. This determines quantitatively a low temperature upper limit for the reliability of QNLSM to the\n2-dim spin-1/2 QHA: 0 \u2264 T /J < T\u039b /J \u2243 1.0. Meanwhile, the spin wave velocity cs can also be explicitly determined from Eq.(12) and Eq.(14). For La2 CuO4 , which\nis a typical 2-dim spin-1/2 QHA with a = 3.79\nq\u00c5 and J \u2243\n\n1500K, we obtain (keeping ~) ~cs = 2JSa d +\n\nT\u039b\n2SJ\n\n\u2243\n\n0.85 eV \u00c5. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental data ~cs = 0.85 \u00b1 0.03 eV \u00c5[14].\nOur main results, i.e., Eqs.(12) and (14), can be further\ntested against the known results for the 2d QHA, among\nwhich the quantum Monte Carlo date is almost exact.\nUp to the three-loop correction, the QNLSM predicts[4]\nthe asymptotic scaling behavior of the correlation length\n\nin the renormalized classical regime as\n\u03be3l = A exp(1/t)[1 \u2212 0.5t + O(t2 )],\n\n(15)\n\nwhere, A = 8e 2\u03c0c\u0303s\u03c1\u0303s is a temperature-independent prefactor, t = 2\u03c0T\u03c1\u0303s is the dimensionless temperature, and c\u0303s\nand \u03c1\u0303s are the renormalized spin-wave velocity and spin\nstiffness which can be consistently determined by large-S\nexpansion. The predicted formula \u03be3l is extremely sensitive to the spin stiffness and is consistent with the QMC\ndata[15, 16] at very large correlation lengths (low temperatures) for S = 1/2 when the best-fit value \u03c1\u0303s = 0.1800 is\nused. However, at moderate correlation lengths, highly\naccurate QMC data[15] and series expansions[17] indicate\na significant discrepancy which rapidly increases with S.\nThe asymptotic scaling at the three-loop sets in at correlation lengths larger than 105 for S = 1/2[15] and cosmological lengths for larger S.\nQuite strikingly, according to the basic assumption of\nthe large-S approach, the discrepancy between the theory and numerics, if it exists, should be significant only\nfor small S. By contrast, in our derivation, the asymptotic scaling behavior Eq.(15) holds for arbitrary S at\nlow temperatures, provided the effects of the intrinsic\nscale T\u039b are correctly taken into account. Note that the\ntemperature dependence in Eq.(15) comes from a simple\nassumption that at nonzero temperature T the correlation length is much larger than the finite extent cs /T\nalong the Euclidean time direction in the renormalized\nclassical regime[3, 4]. In our case, the time extent is replaced by cs (1/T \u2212 1/T\u039b ), making the assumption more\nreasonable. Therefore, we only need to replace T by the\n\u039b\nre-scaled temperature T\u0303 = TT\u039bT\u2212T\nin Eq.(15). The validity of this simple re-scaling requires that T\u0303 < 2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0303s , or\nT < 0.5J for S = 1/2. Interestingly, the re-scaling does\nnot change the two-loop asymptotic scaling behavior. On\nthe other hand, the shifts in cs and gs only modify the\npre-factor A but keep \u03c1s unchanged. Figure 1 shows\nthe deviations of various results from two-loop asymptotic scaling exp(1/t) as a function of t. The three-loop\nresults of Eq.(15) in terms of t and t\u0303 = 2\u03c0T\u0303\u03c1\u0303s are plotted as the 3-loop old (dashed) line and the 3-loop new\n(solid)line, respectively. For our three-loop result, the\nscaling regime begins at roughly \u03be \u2248 102 \u2212 103 , when\nT \u2248 0.3J. As a comparison, a suggested four-loop (dotted) line[15] is plotted by adding the correction O(t2 ) in\nEq.(15) before re-scaling. The coefficient of this term is\n\u22120.75 by fitting the highly accurate QMC data which\nis apparently too large to be obtained within reasonable\nfour-loop corrections[15].\nOur results can also be tested against the known results for the 1d QHA. Note that in 1d, the topological\nterm plays a crucial role, leading to the quantum critical and disordered phases for half integer and integer\nspins, respectively[2, 18]. In the disordered phase, T\u039b\ncan be determined by using the relation E 2 = c2s k 2 + \u22062s .\n\u2206s 2\nThis only leads to a correction O(( 2SJ\n) ) to Eq.(14).\nFor S = 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2, the accurate numerical re-\n\n\f4\n\n\u03be /2-Loop Result\n\n1.0\n\nrespectively.

Mod.\n\nIn conclusion, by using a topologically invariant spin\nvariable path integral approach, we resolve the two crucial problems in the QNLSM description of QHA as mentioned in the beginning of this Letter. The basic parameters in the QNLSM are unambiguously defined for arbitrary spin values. The primary tests discussed above\nshow that the quantum fluctuations in the QHA, which\nare usually underestimated in the large-S approach, are\nnow more properly described. It should be emphasized\nthat the construction of a low energy effective field theory\nfrom the extended phase space path integrals developed\nin this Letter is a general approach, in which the shortest\ntime scale plays a crucial role for self-consistency. This\napproach can be applied to other generalized phase space\npath integrals[12] for the study of low energy physics in\nvarious strongly correlated systems.\nJ.D. acknowledges the hospitality of the Abdus Salam\nInternational Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste,\nItaly, where this work was completed.
