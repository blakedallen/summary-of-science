Introduction\nThe studies of the host galaxies (HGs) of active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) can help us to answer important questions\nrelated with these peculiar objects: (i) what is the origin of the nuclear activity? (ii) what is the origin of radio emission? (Smith & Heckman 1990; Hutchings & Neff\n1992), (iii) which AGNs can be unified by orientation effects (standard unification schemes, Antonucci 1993; Urry\n& Padovani 1995) and which not? (e.g., Ellingson et al.\n1991), (iv) which is the proper model to explain the\nquasars evolution? (e.g., Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000). It\nis necessary to determine the space of parameters filled by\nthe different families of AGNs in order to determine which\napparently normal galaxies could contain a dormant AGN.\nSend offprint requests to: S.F.S\u00e1nchez\n\u22c6\nVisiting Astronomer, German-Spanish Astronomical\nCentre, Calar Alto, operated by the Max-Planck-Institute\nfor Astronomy, Heidelberg, jointly with the Spanish National\nCommission for Astronomy.\n\nStudies of samples of low luminosity and low redshifts AGNs (e.g., MacKenty 1990; Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano et\nal. 1993) showed a difference in the morphology of the\nhost galaxies of radio loud (elliptical) and radio quiet (spiral) sources. Preliminary studies of the HGs of quasars\nfrom groundbased telescopes apparently supported this\nhypothesis to explain radio activity (e.g. Smith et al. 1986;\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty & woltjer 1990). These studies are limited by\nthe atmospheric seeing: The central point-like source contaminates the surrounding HG, and/or even blurred by\nit, due to the point spread function (PSF) . Due to this,\nthese studies are very complex, especially at high z, where\nthe surface brightness of the HGs drops significantly due\nto cosmological dimming. Observing at the near-infrared\n(NIR) reduces the central point-like contribution, since the\nratio between the luminosity of the nuclear source and the\nhost is minimized (Dunlop et al. 1993). This strategy has\nbeen used by several authors (McLeod & Rieke 1994a,b;\nTaylor et al. 1996; Hutchings & Neff 1997; Kotilainen et al.\n1998; Carballo et al. 1998; Aretxaga et al. 1998; Percival\net al. 2001).

The most luminous quasars inhabit elliptical rather than spiral galaxies, despite their\nradio-loudness. Detailed morphological analysis at higher\nz ranges was not possible. It seems that the HGs of different families of radio sources have similar morphologies (down to z <0.4) and luminosities (down to z <1),\nwhich reinforces the standard unification schemes of radio\nsources.\nMore detailed morphological studies have been done\nusing the HST (e.g. Bahcall et al. 1994, 1995a,b, 1996,\n1997; Hutchings et al. 1994; Disney et al. 1995; Hutchings\n& Morris 1995; McLure et al. 1999; Lehnert 1999a,b;\nKirhakos et al. 2001; Hutchings et al. 2002). They show\nthat there is a large fraction of HGs with unusual and\nirregular morphologies, undergoing a merging process or\nwith evidence of such a process in their recent histories.\nHowever, these results were not completely conclusive due\nto: (i) the saturation and undersampling of the point-like\nsource in the HST deep images (e.g., Hutchings et al. 1995;\nMcLure et al. 1999); (ii) strong contamination from emission lines in the optical bands at certain redshifts; (iii)\nthe use of bands that sample the flux down to \u03bb \u223c4000\u00c5,\nin a range not dominated by the stellar emission, which\nlimits the redshift range for studies that use optical bands\n(e.g. z <0.6 for the R-band); (iv) studies mainly based on\nlow-z samples or with a reduced number of objects. On\nthe other hand, the few published studies using NICMOS\ndata appear to confirm the groundbased NIR studies (e.g.,\nMcLeod & McLeod 2001; Kukula et al. 2001; Ridgway et\nal. 2001).\nThe number of spectroscopic studies of HGs is still\nlimited due mainly to the technical difficulties. The first\nattempts to determine the nature of the 'Fuzz' detected\naround the quasars were made nearly two decades ago\n(Boroson & Oke 1982, 1984, and references therein). With\na large number of caveats, they found that the 'Fuzz'\naround QSOs has an stellar nature. More recent studies\n(Canalizo & Stockton 2000; Hughes et al. 2000; Nolan et\nal. 2001; Canalizo & Stockton 2001; Courbin et al. 2002)\n\nhave confirmed the stellar nature of the extended emission. They found that at low z these objects are dominated\nby an old stellar population (tage >12Gyr), with possible\ntraces of more recent star formation events that might be\ndue to past interactions or even major mergers (Canalizo\n& Stockton 2001; Stockton & Ridgway 2001).\nThere have been few attempts to study the properties\nof HGs of radio loud quasars over a large and representative sample. Lehnert et al. (1999a) studied a sample of 43\n3CR radio quasars, using R-band snapshots HST images.\nThey detected the host for about \u223c 50% of their quasars.\nThese HGs present distorted morphologies, close companions (in a \u223c25% of the objects), and a significant alignment with radio emission. As we quoted above, R-band\nimages do not trace well the stellar population of the HGs\nat z >0.6. The use of this band combined with the depth\nof images (16 of the 19 undetected hosts are at z >1), and\nthe lack of morphological classification make their results\ninconclusive. In contrast, McLure et al. (1999) and Dunlop\net al. (2001) found, from R-band deep HST imaging of a\nsample of z <0.4 objects, that the morphologies of the\nHGs of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars and of radio\ngalaxies were very similar (elliptical galaxies), and that\nthere were no significant traces of interactions and/or distorted morphologies. Their sample covers a lower range\nof radio powers than the one studied by Lehnert et al.\n(1999a). It might be impossible to generalize the properties of the HGs of powerful samples of radio quasars, like\n3CR, since these objects trace only the most violent events\nof the radio source family.\nIt is necessary to study the HGs of radio quasars in a\nwide range of redshifts, for complete samples with intermediate radio power, trying to trace the stellar component of\ntheir HGs. The K-band is the best choice to compare with\nother families of radio sources since they have been previous studied in this band (e.g., Lilly et al. 1985; Willot et\nal. 2002). We started this study in 1996 using the B3-VLA\nquasar sample (Vigotti et al. 1997; S\u00e1nchez et al. 2001).\nThis sample consists of 130 radio quasars selected up to\nS408MHz >0.1 Jy. As a part of it we published the results\nbased on the study of the K-band images of 54 quasars\nof this sample (Carballo et al. 1998, hereafter Paper I),\n32 of them were analyzed in order to detect the HG and\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I.

It was possible to recover the\nHG in 16 of them (50%); These were large and luminous\ngalaxies, roughly similar to radio galaxies down to z <1.\nWe present here the study of new K-band images of 31\nradio quasars from the B3-VLA sample.\nThe distribution of this paper is as follows: in Sect. 2\nwe present the sample and the observations and in Sect.\n3 we show the technique used to restore the HGs of the\nquasars. In Sect. 4 we present the results of this analysis.\nIn Sect. 5 we discuss the evolution of HGs of radio sources,\nshowing its K \u2212 z distribution, the structural parameters\nof these HGs, and its relation with radio power and nuclear\nemission. In Sect. 6 we study the relation between nuclear\nemission and radio power. We present the conclusions in\nSect. 7. Throughout this article we have assumed a standard cosmology with Ho =50 Km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and qo =0.5.\nThe selection of other cosmological parameters will not\nsignificantly affect our results 1 .\n\n2. Observations, data reduction and photometry\nTable 1 shows a summary of the observations, including\nthe observing nights, the telescopes and instruments used,\ntheir field of view (FOV) and pixel scale, the exposure\ntime, the error of the photometric calibration (\u03c3K , explained below), the mean seeing during each night (determined from the mean FWHM of the stars observed along\nthe night) and the mean surface brightness limit at 3\u03c3 for\neach night.\nA standard NIR observing procedure was used: n unregistered exposures of t seconds each one were taken and\nthe average image was registered. A number of k average\nimages were obtained following a grid pattern around the\nobject central position, with an offset of l arcseconds. Both\nthe target and the photometric standards were observed\nusing the same procedure. The selection of the abovementioned parameters (n,t,k and l) depended on the characteristics of the detector and on the sky background level\nof the night. For the WHIRCAM images 75 unregistered\nexposures of 2 second, and 6 average images with a 17\u2032\u2032\noffset were taken, which allowed a total exposure time of\n900 seconds. For the October 1997 OMEGA images 25\nunregistered exposures of 2 seconds, and 9 average images\nwith a 35\u2032\u2032 offset were taken. The procedure was repeated\n4 times to reach a total exposure time of 1800 s. For the\nFebruary 1999 images the exposure time of the unregistered frames was 4 seconds and the whole procedure was\nrepeated only three times. The total exposure time was\n2700 s.\nThe data were reduced using standard IRAF2 packages. First, a dark frame, obtained before each sequence\nof exposures along the grid, was subtracted from each registered image. For the OMEGA images, domeflats were\n1\n\nA cosmology with Ho =65 Km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9=0.7 and\n\u03bb=0.3 will change the absolute magnitudes of the objects by\n\u223c0.3 mag in the range of redshifts we considered\n2\nIRAF is distributed by the NOAO, which is operated by\nAURA, Inc., under contract to the NSF\n\n3\n\nobtained as described in the OMEGA observer's manual.\nFor the WHIRCAM images a skyflat was built computing the mean of all the registered images along the night,\napplying a 1\u03c3 rejection algorithm to remove source contributions. These flat-field images were then used to correct the pixel-to-pixel gain variations for each registered\nimage. The sky background frame was then obtained for\neach sequence of k images (six for WHIRCAM, nine for\nOMEGA), computing the mean of these images, applying\na 1\u03c3 rejection algorithm to remove source contributions.\nThe sky-flux frame was subtracted from each of the images\nof the sequence. Once sky-subtracted, the images of each\nsequence were re-centred and co-added. When more that\none sequence was obtained for a given object, we have recentred and co-added all the sequences to obtain the final\nimage.\nAll the images were obtained in photometric conditions. Flux calibration was carried out using UKIRT faint\nstandard stars (Casali & Hawarden 1992) observed during each night. The number of calibration exposures was\nalways more than 12 per night for the OMEGA runs, and\n4 for the WHIRCAM run (which comprised only \u223c2.5\nhours), taken in the course of the night at different airmasses. Due to the small extinction in the NIR no air mass\ncorrection was needed, as we did not expect significant\ndifferences between the derived calibration zero-points at\ndifferent air-masses. We used the mean zero-point for each\nnight in order to calibrate the exposures. The standard deviation around this value yields the photometric error due\nto the calibration for each night. The K-band magnitudes\nwere them obtained by standard aperture photometry, selecting for each object the aperture where the flux reaches\nthe background.\n\n3. Analysis of the data\nAs we mention in the introduction there are various problems in the detection and restoration of the HGs of quasars\nat high z; among these we consider that the most important ones are: (i) the active nucleus dominates the emission\nover a wide range of wavelengths, (ii) the central source\nflux contaminates the HG flux, due to the width of the\nPSF, (iii) the angular sizes of the galaxies are smaller at\nz \u223c1 than at low z(<0.4), viz. in the range of a few arcseconds, and (iv) at higher redshift, the angular size increases\nagain, but cosmological dimming makes the surface brightness of the HGs drop significantly following a (z + 1)4 -law\n(i.e., about 3 magnitudes from z\u223c0 to z\u223c1).\nWe have minimalized as much as possible the effects\nof these problems. The first problem was reduced by the\nselection of the wavelength. At \u03bb \u223c 1\u03bcm the SED of the\ngalaxies presents a peak, whereas the SED of the quasars\npresents a minimum (Dunlop et al. 1993). Therefore, at\nz \u223c1 the ratio between HG and quasar fluxes is maximal\nin the K-band (\u03bbeff \u223c 2\u03bcm). An additional advantage is\nthat in the NIR the HG emission is dominated by its stellar\ncomponent, roughly related with the mass of the galaxy.\nThis is in contrast with the optical bands, where the de-\n\n\f4\n\nS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nimplemented in the ELLIPSE task included in the stsdas package of IRAF.\n2. The PSF was modelled by a Moffat function (Moffat\n1969). The use of an analytical model allows us to give\na better description of the PSF in the outer regions\n(normally more noisy) and let us use the PSF for a\nproper convolution with galaxy models (see below).\nTo determine the best PSF model for each image we\nfitted the SBP of the field stars to the Moffat function\n\u0015\u2212\u03b2\n\u0014\nr 2\n1/\u03b2\n)\n\u2212 1) * (\nIMoffat (r; Io , r1/2 , \u03b2) = Io 1 + (2\nr1/2\n\nFig. 1. Surface brightness profile (SBP) of the quasar B3\n0740+380C (solid circles) together with the SBP of the\nfield stars scaled to the quasar intensity peak (points).\nThe solid line shows the mean of the stars' SBPs, and the\ndashed line shows the mean PSF derived from fitting a\nMoffat function.\ntection of extended emission around the quasars does not\nguarantee that the HG has been detected, since there are\nother more important contributions to the extended flux,\nsuch as gas flow emission (e.g., Heckman et al. 1991).\nWe have assumed that any extended emission detected\naround the quasars is associated with the stellar component of the HG. Other types of extended emission, such\nas radio-aligned components similar to those seen in radio\ngalaxies (Dunlop & Peacock 1993) or synchrotron-beamed\nemission, might be detected in the K-band, although they\nare expected to contribute less than 10% to the HG flux\n(Riegler et al. 1992; Ridgway & Stockton 1997). For the\nobjects at z >2 some contribution from H\u03b1 is expected,\nabout \u223c15% (Lehnert et al. 1999b). Therefore, we assume\nthat the images of the quasars at the NIR wavelengths\nconsist of two components only: (i) the nuclear, point like\nsource, characterized by a scaled PSF (to match its flux),\nand (ii) the host galaxy.\nOur procedure to detect and recover the HG consists\non the following steps:\n1. We obtained for each image the surface brightness profiles (SBP) of the quasar and of a number of field\nstars. We masked the possible contaminating sources\nbefore obtaining the SBP. This includes basically all\nthe sources that are more than 3\u2032\u2032 distant from the\nquasar peak and that do not show any connection such\nas bridges or tails with the quasar. To obtain the SBP\nincreases the signal to noise ratio since it implies an\naverage of the brightness along the eccentric anomaly.\nWe reduce the problem to one dimension, although this\nimplies a loss of information. This procedure allowed\nus to study the properties of HGs that were initially\npoorly visible in the images. The SBP was obtained\nusing the techniques discussed in Jedrzejewski (1987),\n\nThe width of the central core is determined by r1/2 ,\nand \u03b2 determines the extension of the wings. Io is the\nscaling factor that determines the peak of the intensity. Once the field stars are fitted to this model we\nobtain a mean value for both r1/2 and \u03b2. These values\ncharacterize the mean PSF in the image.\nIt was found that about \u223c10 stars per field were\nenough to determine the PSF parameters. There were\nenough stars per field in the OMEGA images, due to\ntheir large field of view. However, the WHIRCAM images have only 1 or 2 stars per field; still, these were\nfound to present a stable PSF image-to-image, mainly\ndue to the short time period in which they were obtained (<2.5 hours). Therefore, we used all the stars\navailable in all the WHIRCAM images to determine\nthe PSF parameters.\n3. The mean PSF was used to determine the probability that a quasar was extended by fitting the surface brightness profile of the quasar to the function:\nP SF (r; Io ) = IMoffat (r; Io , r1/2\n\u02c6 , \u03b2\u0302). This method was\ntested on 200 simulated stars, with the same characteristics of seeing, brightness and signal-to-noise as the\nobserved quasars. This yields a probability distribution\nthat the surface brightness of a star fits the mean PSF,\na distribution that can be used to estimate the probability that a quasar is extended or not. We have applied the same test to the field stars, finding that they\nfit the mean PSF model within a 95% probability, as\nexpected. We also found that when an artificial extension is detected in a field star, it always contribute less\nthan 10% to the total star flux.\nFigure 1 ilustrates this procedure. We show the SBP\nof the quasar B3 0740+380C, together with the scaled\nSBP of the field stars used to determine the mean\nPSF. There is a dispersion of the individual star SBPs\naround the mean PSF. The quasar profile is further\nfrom the mean PSF than the field stars, and shows a\nclear extension. This difference in the SBP compared\nwith the differences found for the stars can be used to\nset a probability for the extension to be real.\n4. The surface brightness profile of the quasars was then\nfitted to a two-component model: a free-scale mean\nPSF model plus a galactic model. We have initially\nrestricted ourselved to the two most commonly used\n\n\fTable 2.

Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nanalytical prescriptions for the galactic model: an exponential Freeman (1970) law describing disk galaxies\nand a de Vaucouleurs (1948) r1/4 law describing elliptical galaxies. The fitting procedure has three free parameters: the nuclear component flux, the host galaxy\nflux, and the galaxy scale (for each analytical model).\nThe galactic profile was convolved during each step of\nthe fitting procedure by the mean PSF (normalized to\none), in order to take into account the effects of the\nseeing on the shape of the profiles. In general, the nuclear component has a more intense surface brightness,\nwith larger signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, we assume\nthat with this method we are able to recover the flux\nof the nuclear component better than that of the extended component. We then estimate the HG flux by\nsubtracting the recovered nuclear component flux from\nthe total flux.\n5. We found that the quasar profile fits both models well.\nIn order to investigate this we applied the procedure to\na sample of 1000 simulated quasars. These simulated\nquasars consist on a central point-like source, following\na Moffat function, plus an extended source, following\nan exponential or a r1/4 function. These images cover\ndifferent ranges of the paramter space, such as different\nratios between the central and the extended emission,\nbetween the effective radius and the seeing, and the\nsignal to noise of the total source. They reproduce the\nbasic parameters of the real data, such as background\nnoise, pixel scale, and image depth. The simulations\nare explained in S\u00e1nchez (2001) and they will be published in a separate paper (S\u00e1nchez 2003).\nThey show that it is not possible in our range of parameters to distinguish between a spiral or an elliptical HG by the comparison of the \u03c72 /\u03bd resulting from\nthe profile fitting to the two above-mentioned models.\nThis problem has been described before (McLure et al.\n1999). This could be due to the larger signal-to-noise\nof the central region, which dominates the fits to such\nan extent that subtle differences in the extended emission become indistinguishable. We also found that the\npercentages of flux recovered for both the HG and the\nnuclear source are quite similar, independent of the\nmodel.\n6. To solve this problem we followed a different approach:\n(i) the HG surface brightness profile was obtained subtracting the mean PSF model, scaled to the nuclear\nsource flux (previously obtained), and (ii) this profile was fitted to a generalized galaxy model (Igal \u221d\n\u03b1\ner ). This model includes the other two as particular cases: the exponential model is recovered if \u03b1=1,\nand the r1/4 -model if \u03b1=1/4. The values of \u03b1 obtained with this method were used to classify the HGs.\nThis method was applied to the simulated images, and\nyielded sharply different distributions of the \u03b1 parameter for the spiral and for the elliptical galaxies (Figure\n2). We have used the obtained \u03b1 to classify the HG\nmorphologically. A similar procedure has been applied\n\nFig. 2. Probability density functions for exponent \u03b1 obtained from fits to simulated elliptical and disk galaxies.\nby McLure et al. (1999) to distingue between exponential and r1/4 models.\nThe idea behind this method is that the most important region to distinguish between an elliptical and a\ndisk galaxy is the galaxy core. The core is severely affected by the nuclear component substraction. Even in\nthe case of a perfect subtraction there is an increase\nof the noise: The photon noise in this area is the sum\nof the photon noise from the galaxy and the QSO nucleus. Therefore, there is a loss of information in the\ninner part. Indeed, it is noticed in the simulations that\nthe preferred \u03b1 parameters of a simulated elliptical or\nspiral galaxy were not the expected values (0.25 and\n1.0, respectively) but somewhat larger ones (0.3 and\n1.15, respectively). Effects like this have been noticed\nby other authors (Meurer et al. 1995; Whitmore et al.\n1999). If we force the model to fit the data to the theoretical values, both of them will fit equally badly, and\ncannot distinguish between the models. However, letting \u03b1 free to be fitted we can recover the parameter\nthat fits the data best.\nIn Paper I we used a rather different method to detect\nand restore the HGs. Before the surface brightness profile\nof the quasars was obtained, the images were deconvolved\nby a mean PSF. The brightness profiles were then obtained and fitted to different models: a gaussian function\n(which characterizes the deconvolved point-like sources)\nand a gaussian plus galactic model (which characterizes\na point-like plus an extended source). This method had\nto be applied due to the lower quality of the data used\nin Paper I. In order to compare the results obtanied in\nPaper I with the present results, and to set limits to both\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nmethods, we have applied both of them to the simulations\nmentioned above.\nWe found that both methods are able to recover the\nflux of the HGs, although in different ranges of parameters. The method used in this article is valid for HGs for\nwhich the contribution to the total flux was larger than\n\u223c9% (\u223c12% for the method used in Paper I). In this range\nof fluxes, the magnitudes of the HGs are recovered with\nan error of about \u223c0.26 mag (\u223c0.52 mag for the method\nused in Paper I). There is no tendency to over- or underestimate the flux down to KHG \u223c18.5 mag (\u223c17 for Paper\nI). Moreover, with the method presented here it is possible\nto recover the effective radius of the HG, with an error of\n\u223c25% (A parameter that we could not recover in Paper I).\nHowever, the current method requires (i) a good sampling\nof the PSF, using \u223c5-7 stars with the same brightness as\nthe quasars, or a more reduced number of brighter stars,\nand (ii) that the sizes of the HGs are similar to or larger\nthan the seeing, which, for quasars at z \u223c1 limits the use\nof this method to good-seeing images (i.e., better than\n\u223c1.3\u2032\u2032 ). The method used in Paper I, based on a deconvolution process, is still valid for lesser-quality images. It\ndoes not require a precise shampling of PSF and it can be\nused for images with seeing larger than 1.3\u2032\u2032 , although it\nrecovers the flux of the HG with larger uncertainties (0.52\nmag) and for brighter HGs (>12%).\n\n4. Results of the analysis\nTable 2 lists the sample of objects, including some basic\nparameters, such as the redshift and radio properties, and\nthe K-band photometry. We have also listed the results\nfrom the analysis. A QSO has been classified as extended\nwhenever (1) the probability that its SBP deviates from\nthe mean PSF profile is larger than 95% and (2) the contribution of the extended source to the total flux is larger\nthan 9%. These criteria have been selected based on the\nresults from the simulations and our analysis over the field\nstars.\nWe found an extension in 16 of the 31 quasars (55% of\nthe sample). The extension around B3 0143+446 is considered dubious, although it satisfies the criteria. This object\nshows a nearby star at less than 6\u2032\u2032 which could affect\nits SBP even when a proper mask has been applied. We\nwill not include this object in our further analysis. Ten\nQSOs have a probability of being extended of more than\n99%. The remaining 6 quasars have probabilities between\n95% and 99%. Of theses 6, four are in the range of the\nfaintest detected HGs (KHG > 18 mag). The fraction of\ndetected HGs decreases with redshift, being 75% of the\nsample at z <1 and 48% at z >1. Beyond this redshift\nthe fraction of detected galaxies is roughly constant. This\nresult is expected since at high redshift both the surface\nbrightness and apparent luminosity of the HGs decrease,\nwhich makes their detection difficult. We have not set a\nmagnitude limit for the undetected host galaxies, since the\ndetection does not depend only on the brightness of the\nsource.\n\n7\n\nAll the HGs have a larger probability of being elliptical\ngalaxies than of being spirals. For an individual HG the\nprobability that it is a spiral is a 7-17% and that it is\nand elliptical is a 40-84%. This is the first time that a\nmorphological analysis of the HGs of a sample of radio\nquasars yields a conclusive result beyond z >0.4. Previous\nresults (Kotilainen & Falomo 2000, Kotilainen et al. 1998,\nKukula et al. 2001) directly assume a certain profile (r1/4 ),\nor have inconclusive results from their analysis. Our result\nshows that the HGs of radio quasars at high redshift have\nthe same morphology as the radio galaxies, supporting the\nunification schemes of both radio sources. Similar results\nwere found by Taylor et al. (1996), McLure et al. (1999)\nand Dunlop et al. (2001), at low redshift (z <0.4).\nThe photometry of seven of these objects was presented in Paper I. The differences between the K-band\nmagnitudes are within the errors (\u223c0.3 mag). In four of\nthem it was possible to follow a morphological analysis.\nThree have an extension detected in both studies (B3\n0704+384, B3 0740+380C and B3 1315+396). The differences between their HG magnitudes are -0.5, -0.4 and 0.7\n(respectively), with a mean difference of 0.05\u00b10.65 mag.\nThese values are within the expected errors (\u223c0.5 mag for\nPaper I HG magnitudes, and \u223c0.2 mag for current data).\nThe extension of the remaining quasar (B3 0926+388) has\nbeen detected in the present study only, since its magnitude is much fainter than the detection limit for HGs\nreported in Paper I.\nThe HG contribution to the total flux ranges between\n14% (B3 2349+410) and 92% (B3 0729+391), with a mean\ncontribution of \u223c41%. Similar values have been reported\nin Paper I (range between 18%-83% and mean \u223c50%),\nand studies based on lower redshift samples for similar\nwavelengths (Taylor et al. 1996, Kotilainen et al. 1998).\nThese values are lower at optical wavelengths, \u226420% for\nR-band images (e.g., Lehnert et al. 1999a, McLure et al.\n1999). Therefore, the extended emission is redder than the\nnuclear emission. This result is expected if a stellar component dominates the extended emission rather than other\ncontributions (such as scattered flux from the nucleus).\nRecent results based on off-nuclear spectroscopy have confirmed its stellar nature (Canalizo & Stockton 2000; Nolan\net al. 2001; Canalizo & Stockton 2001; Courbin et al.\n2002).\nWe have obtained a restored image of the HG by subtracting an image of the nuclear point-like source. This image was built assuming a Moffat function with the meanPSF parameters (obtained by fitting to the field stars). Its\nflux was fixed to the value obtained from the fitting procedure for the nuclear component. The image was built using the package ARTDATA implemented in IRAF. Figure\n3 shows the contour plots and surface brightness profiles\nfor the sources with detected extension. In each panel (a)\nshows the contour plot (left) and profile (right) of the\noriginal source, and (b) shows the contour plot (left) and\nprofile (right) of the recovered host galaxy. The solid line\nin (a) shows the surface brighteness profile of the PSF\nscaled to the quasar peak. The \u03c72 /\u03bd from the comparison\n\n\f8\n\nS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nof both profiles and the probability of being extended have\nalso been included for each quasar. It is clearly seen that\nthe objects present a significant extension from the comparison of both profiles. The orientation of the contour\nplots is North (up) and East (left), and the field-of-view\ncorresponds to 16\u2032\u2032 \u00d716\u2032\u2032 . We have plotted the raw data before masking for nearby companions. In some cases (e.g.,\nB3 0006+397, B3 0110+401) there are close companions\nthat affect the unmasked SBP. However, the extension is\nclearly seen in spatial regions not affected by these companions. This is not the case for quasar B3 0143+466,\nclassified as dubious.\nSeven of the 16 objects present distortions, tails or\nbridges with possible close companions at <30\u2032\u2032 (40% of\nthe sample). These distortions could be traces of past collisions, interactions or even merging processes, which affect the host and nearby galaxies. In some of them, B3\n0219+443 and B3 0740+380C, the optical-to-NIR colours\nof the nearby objects (<30\u2032\u2032 ) are compatible with the\ncolours of galaxies at the redshift of the quasars (S\u00e1nchez\n2001; S\u00e1nchez & Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano 2002). However, a contamination from a nearby object, either a galaxy or a faint\nstar, within \u223c2\u2032\u2032 of the quasar could produce a similar\neffect and create an artificial distorted HG. We have estimated the mean density of objects in our images using\nthe number of objects detected in the February 1999 images (the deepest images with the larger field of view).\nWe found a density of 2.7\u00b10.6 10\u22123 obj/arcsec2, including both stars and galaxies. The large dispersion is due\nto the fact that these objects tend to inhabit clusters or\ngroups of galaxies of different populations (see S\u00e1nchez &\nGonz\u00e1lez-Serrano 2002, also for a detailed explanation of\nthe procedure to determine the density). Using these numbers, we expect to find 0.043 objects within a box of 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d74\u2032\u2032\naround each quasars. I.e., we expect that a contaminating source could create an artificial distorted HG in 4.3%\nof the objects. For our sample of 16 extended sources we\ndo not expect any significant contribution from this effect\n(\u223c0.64 possible contaminted objects).\nTogether with data from Paper I, we have a collection\nof 29 HGs obtained from the analysis of the K-band images of 60 radio quasars from the B3-VLA sample. Fifteen\nof them (Paper I) show evidence of possible interactions\n(\u223c50% of the sample). This evidence is tenuous and should\nbe confirmed by spectroscopics studies of both the host\ngalaxies and the nearby companions.\n\n5. The properties of the HGs of radio sources\n5.1. The K \u2212 z distribution: The evolution of the HGs\nFigure 4 shows the K-band apparent magnitude of HGs\nof radio quasars as a function of redshift. The solid circles\nrepresent the HGs presented in this study, and the open\ncircles the HGs presented in Paper I. The remaining points\nrepresent data obtained from the literature: diamonds\nfrom Lehnert et al. (1992), open squares from Taylor et\nal. (1996), asterisks from Kotilainen et al. (1998), stars\n\nfrom Kotilainen & Falomo (2000), triangles from Falomo\net al. (2001) and solid squares from Kukula et al. (2001).\nThe HG magnitudes from Lehnert et al. (1992) were corrected by 0.4 magnitudes to take into account the underestimation of the HG flux due to the total subtraction of\nthe central point-like source, following the indications of\nthe authors. Magnitudes from Kotilainen et al. (1998),\nKotilainen & Falomo (2000), Falomo et al. (2001) and\nKukula et al. (2001) were transformed from H to K band\nusing the correction suggested by authors (H \u2212 K \u223c0.2\nmag, Kotilainen et al. 1998). We have used only the 2\nHGs detected in the H-band from Kukula et al. (2001)\nwith a reliable result in the radial profile fitting. We have\nnot considered their detections in the J-band (due to the\nuncertainties in the transformation to the K-band), and\ntheir dubious detections. This comprises a heterogeneous\nsample of 69 HGs, 29 B3-VLA HGs plus 40 HGs extracted\nfrom the literature.\nThe shaded region shows the space occupied by the\nradio galaxies of different samples (\u00b11.5\u03c3 from the mean\nvalue), including the 3C and B2 (Class 1Jy) samples, studied by Lilly et al. (1985) and Lilly (1989), the 6C and 7C\nsample, and the HzRG (High-z radio galaxies). The distribution of the mean value is represented by the dashed\nline. All the radio galaxy data have been extracted from\nFig. 1 of Van Breugel et al. (1999), except for the 7C\ndata, obtained from Lacy et al. (2000) and Willot (2002).\nThese radio galaxy samples, except for HzRG, are roughly\ncomplete (i.e. 3C is 98% complete). In contrast, only low-z\nquasar host samples are complete (e.g. Taylor et al. 1996).\nThe quasar hosts are mainly \u223c50% complete, as only the\nbrightest objects are detected.\nThe distributions are roughly similar. Therefore, the\nHGs of different families of radio sources have similar luminosities at different cosmological epochs, down to z <3.\nHowever, 9 of the 70 HGs presented in this figure are\nclearly more luminous than the radio galaxies (\u223c13% of\nthe HGs sample), 6 of them at z >1. Considering also\nthat only half of the HGs of the radio quasars have been\nrecovered (or even less at z > 1, as we quoted above),\nwe conclude that although the mean distributions seem\nto agree, the dispersion along the mean value is larger for\nthe HGs. The errors of the HG magnitudes (upper-left\nbox) are clearly larger than the errors of the magnitudes\nof the radio galaxies. This could account for the larger\ndispersion in the distribution in Fig. 4. But not all the\ndifference could be due to this cause: the largest errors\nwere about 0.5 mag, and the difference between the magnitudes of the high-luminosity HGs and a brightest radio\ngalaxies at the same redshift was \u223c1-1.5 mag. We need to\nexplore other possibilities to explain these extreme luminosities.\nDifferent evolutionary models are shown in Fig.\n4. Each solid concave line shows the evolution of\nan elliptical galaxy with different formation redshifts\n(zfor =7,4.5,2.5,1.5,1.0 and 0.7, from right to left). Each\nconvex line shows the evolution of a galaxy in a continuous burst process with different formation redshifts\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I.

In each panel (a) is the\ncontour map (left) and surface brightness (right) of the original image, and (b) is the contour map (left) and surface\nbrigthness (right) of the HG image. The solid line in (a) shows the mean PSF scaled to the quasar intensity peak.\nThe distances between small marks are 2\u2032\u2032 (for objects observed with OMEGA), and 1.2\u2032\u2032 (for objects observed with\nWHIRCAM). The size of the contour maps is 16\u2032\u2032 \u00d716\u2032\u2032 for all the images. First contour level is at 2\u03c3 per pixel, with a\nseparation of 0.5 mag between successive contours.\n(zfor =2.5,1.5,1.0 and 0.7, from right to left). These models\nhave been included to show the most extreme situations,\nfrom pasive to violent evolution, and from old to young\ngalaxies. The solid near-straight line shows the magnitudes for a galaxy without evolution, which could be considered the most extreme situation of a very old galaxy\nwithout present star formation. The evolution tracks have\nbeen determined using the GISSEL code (Bruzual &\nCharlot 1993), assuming an intrinsic luminosity of M\u2217\n(Mobasher et al. 1993), and a Salpeter mass distribution with a range of masses between 0.1 and 125 M\u2299\n\n(Salpeter 1955). The instrinsic luminosity has been selected to match the data at low-z for both families of\nHGs. We have used the E-type and Burst-type isochrone\nspectral energy distributions (ISED) from Bolzonella et\nal. (2000).\nThe mean distribution of magnitudes with redshift is\nwell described by an old E-type galaxy model, near to\na no-evolution model. However, there is a large dispersion around this mean track. The dispersion could be explained by a range of formation redshifts, a range of different evolutions and/or a range of intrinsic luminosities (see\n\n\f10\n\nS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nFig. 3. Continued\nFigure). In the first two cases, as we explained in Paper\nI, the brightest HGs would be galaxies in a violent star\nformation process. These galaxies would be blue and their\npredicted optical magnitudes would as bright as (or even\nbrighter than) the observed quasar magnitudes. Therefore,\na large range of star-formation redshifts or violent evolution have to be ruled out as a general explanation to the\ndata. In the same way, Nolan et al. (2001) and de Vries\net al. (2000) have presented evidence that low-z quasar\nhosts and radio galaxies are dominated by a stellar population of at least \u223c12Gyr. It appears more likely that the\ndispersion in the distribution is due to a dispersion in the\ninstrinsic luminosity of the HGs. This dispersion seems\nto be larger for the HGs of radio quasars than for radio\ngalaxies.\n\nEales & Rawlings (1996), Rawlings (1998), and more\nrecently Willot et al. (2002) found that the low radioluminosity radio galaxies (6C and 7C) are fainter at the\nNIR than powerful ones (3C and B2) at the same redshift.\nThis implies a correlation between the radio power and\nthe NIR luminosity of the galaxy. Its effect on the K \u2212 z\ndistribution is an increase in the dispersion. Therefore,\nthe K \u2212 z distribution for the different families of radio\nsources is well described by a mean evolution typical for\nan old E-type galaxy (or a no-evolution model), and a\nrange of absolute luminosities correlated with the radio\npower. The reason for this correlation could be a relation\nof both parameters (radio power and HG luminosity) with\nthe central black hole mass (McLure et al. 1999; Dunlop\net al. 2001).\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\n11\n\nFig. 3. Continued\nThis scenario describes the observed distribution accurately. Moreover, it explains the narrower distribution observed for the 3C radio galaxies due to the reduced range\nof radio luminosities (Lilly et al. 1985). In this context, we\ndo not find radio galaxies as luminous in the NIR as the\nultraluminous HGs observed here (\u223c13% of the sample)\ndue to a selection effect. However, this scenario implies a\nrelation between the HG luminosities and the radio power.\n\n5.2. Relation between the HG luminosity and the radio\npower\nFigure 5 shows the radio power of the 29 HGs of B3-VLA\nquasars plus the 30 HGs obtained from literature with\npublished flux at 1460 MHz (out of the original 40 HGs).\nThe radio power has been obtained asuming a spectral\n\nindex of \u03b1=\u22121 for the radio emission, in all the objects.\nThere is a clear correlation between these parameters for\nboth the heterogeneous sample (r=0.81;P >99.99%), and\nthe B3-VLA sample (r=0.70;P =99.88%). The B3-VLA\nsubsample covers a range of radio-power/redshifts not\nvery well covered before by data in the literature, extending the studies to more powerful/higher redshifts objects.\nFigure 6 shows the distribution of radio power at\n1460 MHz against the absolute magnitude of the HGs.\nThese parameters are clearly correlated, both for the heterogeneous sample (r=-0.74;P >99.99%) and the B3VLA subsample (r=-0.56;P =99.81%). This correlation\ncan be accounted for by the strong dependence on redshift shown by both parameters (the absolute magnitude of the host galaxies correlates with redshift, r=0.60;P >99.99%).

Continued\nshift, we find that there is still a correlation for the lowz subsample (r=-0.61; P >99.99%; ngal =37), although\nonly a faint tendency for high-z subsample (r=-0.32,\nP =83.93%; ngal =22). It seems that there is an intrinsic relation between these two parameters, not induced by their\ndepencence with redshift. Similar tendencies have been described for radio galaxies (Ledlow & Owen 1996, Rawlings\net al. 1998; Lacy et al. 2000; Jarvis et al. 2001; Inskip et\nal. 2002; Willot et al. 2002), and radio-quiet quasars, of\nwhich the HGs at high z (z\u223c2-3) are 2 mag fainter than\npowerful radio galaxies at the same redshift (Rawlings et\nal. 2001).\nThere is a simple explanation of why we may expect\nto find that stellar luminosities of HGs are correlated with\nradio luminosity. In essence, this comes down to the fact\nthat more massive objects are generally more luminous.\n\nIn this case there are several observed correlations that\ncan be used to specify the relationship between stellar\nand radio luminosity. First, the stellar luminosity of ellipticals is known to correlate almost linearly with the\ncentral black hole mass (Magorrian et al. 1998), presumably because the stellar luminosity is very closely related\nto the stellar mass and there is a tight correlation between host and black hole masses (Gebhart et al. 2000;\nFerrarese & Merrit 2000). The radio luminosity is found\nto be linearly related to the narrow emission line luminosity (Willot et al. 2001) and therefore to the UV ionizing\nluminosity (Rawlings & Saunders 1991; Willot et al. 1999;\nCarballo et al. 1999). The UV ionizing luminosity is due\nto the accretion of material onto the supermassive black\nhole. In fact, Franceschini et al. (1998) found a direct correlation between the radio luminosity and the mass of the\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I.

(1999), and more recently Dunlop et al.\n(2001), reached a similar conclusion studying a sample of\nlow-z HGs. Our result extends theirs on the radio-loud\nsources to a wide range of redshifts (0< z <3), increasing\nthe statistical significance.\n\n5.3. Relation between the luminosities of the HG and\nthe central source\nThere are several pieces of evidence supporting a scaling of the nuclear luminosity with HG luminosity. As we\nquoted above, Magorrian et al (1998) found a correlation between the HG luminosity and the central blackhole mass. Since the accretion of matter is the main engine of the nuclear activity, it is expected that nuclear\n\n\f14\n\nS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I.

Distribution of the radio power at 1460 MHz against\nthe absolute magnitude of the HGs. The solid symbols are the\nHGs for the B3-VLA quasars; the open symbols are the HGs\nfrom the literature.\n\nluminosity scales also with the black-hole mass. Indeed,\nDunlop et al. (2001) have shown that radio-loud quasars\nemit within a range of a 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity. This luminosity is proportional to the black-hole\nmass. Therefore, a relation is expected between HG and\nnuclear component luminosities. On the other hand, hierarchical galaxy formation models of Kauffman & Haehnelt\n(2000), in which they have addressed both the formation\nof bulges/elliptical galaxies and the formation and fueling\nof their associated black holes, predict a faint correlation\nbetween both luminosities.\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of the absolute magnitudes of the HGs against the absolute magnitude of\nthe nuclear source. There is a clear correlation for the\nheterogeneous sample (r=0.56;P >99.99%) and the B3-\n\nVLA subsample (r=0.57;P =99.88%). The strong depence\nthat both parameters show with redshift could contribute significantly to this correlation (the absolute magnitude of the central sources also correlates with redshift,\nr=-0.89;P >99.99%). We have determined the correlation coefficient for the low and high-z subsamples, finding that there is still a correlation in both subsamples\n(r=0.45;P =99.61% and r=0.41;P =97.37%, respectively).\nIn order to remove the redshift effect we have determined\nthe correlation coefficients for the apparent magnitudes,\ninstead of the absolute magnitudes. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the apparent magnitudes of the HGs against\nthe apparent magnitude of the nuclear source. We have\nfound that the correlation is even stronger for the heterogeneous sample (r=0.74;P >99.99%), although only a\nslight correlation is found for the B3-VLA subsample,\nwhich covers a narrower range of apparent magnitudes\n(r=0.34;P =96.79%). An intrinsic relation between both\nparameters rather than a redshift induced relation seems\nto be the correct explanation for the observed distributions.\nThe distributions in Figs 7 and 8 could be induced by\ndifferent biases. The QSO selection criteria as point-like\nsources could depopulate the lower-right region (bright\nHGs harboring a faint nuclear source). For the B3-VLA\nsample, the point-like criterion was applied to POSS plate\ndata (Vigotti et al. 1997). Similar data were used for the\ndifferent samples included in our heterogeneous sample\n(e.g. Drinkwater et al. 1997 for the PKS). Taking into\naccount the mean B \u2212 K colours of the quasars and the\nelliptical galaxies (\u223c2.5 and \u223c5 mag respectively), we do\nnot expect a significant effect of this bias on the observed\ndistribution. E.g., a quasar with B=17 mag, classified as\npoint-like using the POSS plates could have a host galaxy\nthat contributes 50% to its K-band flux, and it would be\nundetectable on POSS plates (BHG \u223c20.5 mag).\nOn the other hand, the upper-left region (faint HGs\nharboring a bright nuclear source) could be depopulated\ndue to the incompleteness in the HG detection. Only HGs\nthat contribute more than 10% to the total integrated\nflux are considered as real detections. This imposes an\nupper limit envelope on the observed distributions near\nto Kgal =Knuc +2.5. If this is the case we would expect\nan increase of the strength of the correlation with increasing incompleteness. However, as stated before, this\nstrength is the same for the low-z and high-z subsamples,\nbut the completeness decreases significantly (\u223c75% and\n\u223c40% respectively, for the B3-VLA sample). Moreover,\nthis argument could only be applied to the B3-VLA data.\nThe heterogeneous sample was built using HG samples\nthat are mainly complete or less affected by uncompleteness (due mainly to the lower redshift range they cover).\nIndeed, the distribution of B3-VLA data in Fig. 8 does\nnot show a clear envelope at the predicted 2.5 mag from\nthe KNucleus=KHG line.\nThese correlations confirm the tendency presented in\nprevious articles for more powerful quasars to reside in\nmore luminous hosts (e.g., Paper I, Kotilainen et al. 1998,\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I.

The\nsolid symbols are the HGs for the B3-VLA quasars; the open\nsymbols are the HGs from the literature.\n\nFig. 8. Distribution of the K-band apparent magnitudes of\nthe HGs against the apparent magnitude of the central source.\nThe solid symbols are the HGs for the B3-VLA quasars; the\nopen symbols are the HGs from the literature.\n\nKotilainen & Falomo 2000, Taylor et al. 1996). As we\nstated above, the most probable reason for this correlation is a relation of both luminosities with central black\nhole mass. This correlation is weaker or even absent in the\nmore nearby, lower luminosity and radio-quiet AGNs (e.g.\nMcLeod & Rieke 1995; McLeod & Rieke 1994a,b; Percival\net al. 2001). The smaller dynamical range of magnitudes\ncovered by these samples could account for the absence of\nthis correlation.\n\n5.4. Structural parameters of the HGs\nThe mean absolute magnitude of the HGs is \u223c-27.02\u00b11.81\n\u2217\nmag, which corresponds to a luminosity of \u223c3L\u2217 (MK\n=25.86 from Mobasher et al. 1993). \u223c75% of the ob-\n\n15\n\njects are brighter than L\u2217 . Their mean effective radius\nis 15.00\u00b113.90 kpc and all but one have re >3.5 kpc.\nCapaccioli et al. (1992) found that there is a limit to the\nsize of the galaxies (\u223c4.5 kpc), below which it is rare to\nfind AGNs, BCG and/or cDs. As expected, \u223c90% of the\nHGs of our sample are above this limit. They are large\nand luminous galaxies, similar to BCGs or cDs, which are\nin the range of the brightest known galaxies.\nElliptical galaxies show fundamental relations between\ntheir luminosities, their effective radii and their velocity dispersions (Hamabe & Kormendy 1987; Mobasher\net al. 1999). These relations define a plane in the threedimensional space described above, the plane known as the\nFundamental Plane (FP). The projection of this plane on\nthe luminosity-radius plane (\u03bce \u2212 re ) determines a relation between both parameters (Hoessel et al. 1987), with\na slope near to \u223c3. This relation, of which the origin is\nstill unknown, is shown by all the elliptical galaxies, and\nlimits the structural models presented for these objects.\nIt has been suggested that episodes of collision/merging\ncould produce this relation (Capaccioli et al. 1992).\nWe have determined the effective surface brightness\nof the HGs assuming a r1/4 profile, correcting for cosmological dimming (e.g., Kolb & Turner 1990). Figure 9\nshows the distribution of the effective surface brightness\nwith effective radius for the 50 HGs of our sample with\npublished effective radius. There is a clear correlation between both parameters, with a slope slightly larger than 3\n(\u223c4.6), roughly similar to the value reported by Taylor et\nal. (1996). Our sample is biased towards bright and large\ngalaxies, especially at high redshift. The lack of small and\nfaint galaxies could artificially increase the slope of the\ncorrelation. The dashed lines show the location on this\nplane of a galaxy with constant magnitude (K=19 mag)\nand constant effective radius at different redshifts. Each\nline corresponds to a certain effective radius within the\nrange 0.1\u2032\u2032 <re <1.5\u2032\u2032 . They represent the region of parameters where the uncompleteness of the detection rise up to\n> 80% for the B3-VLA data (solid circles). Similar exclusion regions could be defined for each sample plotted in the\nfigure. We have restricted the linear regression analysis to\nthe data less affected by this bias (re >10 kpc, n=27 HGs).\nWe found a strong correlation (r=0.80, P >99.99%), of\nthe form:\n\u03bce = 15.64\u00b10.60 + 3.86\u00b10.46log(re )\nsimilar to the well-known relation for the elliptical galaxies.\n\n6. Relation between the absolute magnitude of\nthe nuclear source and the radio power\nFigure 10 shows the distribution of the radio power of\nthe quasars against the K-band absolute magnitude of\nthe nuclear source.

Splitting the sample in low-z and high-z\nsubsamples by the mean redshift, we found that the correlation persists for both subsamples (r=0.52,P =99.99%\nand r=0.51,P =98.20% respectively). This suggests that\nit is not induced by the redshift. The derived relation between the K-band luminosity of the nuclear source and\n0.37\u00b10.04\nradio power is LK,qso \u221d P1460MHz\n. Carballo et al. (1999)\nfound a similar relation between the optical-UV luminos0.52\u00b10.10\nity and radio power at 408 MHz, L\n\u221d P480MHz\n, for\n2400\u00c5\nthe B3-VLA quasars. These correlations imply a nearly\none-to-one relation between the optical and NIR emission,\nwhich suggests that the principal mechanism of both kind\nof emissions is the same. The correlation between opticalNIR and radio emission in quasars has been discussed\nin Rawlings & Saunders (1991), Serjeant et al. (1998),\nWillot et al. (1999), Carballo et al. (1999) and Simpson\n& Rawlings (2000). It is outside the scope of the present\nstudy to discuss it in detail.\n\n7. Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have presented in this study the K-band images of\n31 radio quasars from the B3-VLA sample, with a redshift range between z \u223c0.5 and z \u223c3.2. A new procedure,\nbased on the analysis of the surface brightness profile, has\nbeen proposed to estimate the flux contributions of both\nthe point-like nucleus and the HG of the quasars. This\n\nprocedure, tested on a wide sample of simulated images\nand field stars, makes it possible to assign a probability of\nbeing extended to each quasar, recover the flux and effective radius of the HG, classify it as elliptical or spiral, and\nrestore the image of the HG. The simulations and tests\non field stars set limits to the detection and reliability of\nthe recovered parameters. A different procedure, used in\nPaper I (Carballo et al. 1998), has also been tested on\nthe simulations, in order to allow the use of the combined\ndata.\nWe have detected the HGs of 16 of the 31 quasars\n(\u223c50% of the sample), all of them with a probability of\nbeing extended of higher than 95%, and 10 of more than\n99%. Together with data from Paper I, we have a sample\nof 29 HGs of B3-VLA quasars. Searching the literature,\nwe have built a sample of heterogeneous HGs of radioloud quasars that comprises 69 HGs. These HGs are large\n(re \u223c15 kpc) and luminous (\u223c75% of them brighter than\nL\u2217 ) elliptical galaxies. They follow the \u03bce -re relation for\nelliptical galaxies. About \u223c45% of the B3-VLA HGs show\ndistortions and tails in their images that could be evidence\nof a merging/colliding process. This result agrees with the\nhypothesis that considers a merging process as the origin\nor triggering mechanism of nuclear activity (e.g. Smith\n& Heckman 1990; Hutching & Neff 1992). There is other\nevidence that supports this scenario: (i) the quasars are\nlocated in overdensities of galaxies compatible with being\nat the same redshifts (e.g. S\u00e1nchez & Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano\n1999; S\u00e1nchez 2001), and in a spatial position where a\ncollision is more likely to produce a merger (S\u00e1nchez &\nGonz\u00e1lez-Serrano 2002); (ii) the traces of recent star formation processes induced by interactions (e.g. Nolan et al\n2001, Canalizo & Stockton 2000); (iii) the need of a violent process that produces an infall of mass in the inner\nregion to explain nuclear activity (e.g. Bekki & Noguchi\n1994).\n\n\fS.F.S\u00e1nchez and J.I. Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano: The Near-Infrared properties of the host galaxies of radio quasars\n\nHowever, it is not clear that the fraction found could\nbe considered as a significant excess of merger galaxies, even if all of them were confirmed. The fraction of\nmerger/irregular galaxies in the local universe is \u223c7%,\nbased on classical studies like the Shapley-Ames Catalog\n(Shapley & Ames 1932). But this fraction is known to increase with redshift. E.g, van den Bergh et al. (1996) and\nLee & Hwang (2000) found that \u223c39% of the galaxies on\nthe HDF-N and HDF-S show irregular/merger morphologies. We do not have a proper sample of inactive galaxies\nwith a similar redshift range and detailed morphological\nclassification to known if the fraction of mergers found is\nor IS not a significant excess.\nAll the HGs are elliptical galaxies morphologically similar to radio galaxies. The mean luminosity evolution along\na wide range of redshifts (0< z <3) is also similar to the\nevolution shown by radio galaxies. This evolution is well\ndescribed by a model with a single burst of star formation\nat very high redshift (zfor >7) and little or no evolution\nsince that period. It seems that the galaxies have been\nformed beyond z \u223c3, without major burst process down\nto this redshift. This supports the unification schemes of\nradio sources, since both families of radio sources are similar in features that do not depend on the angle-of-view.\nThe HGs present a larger dispersion in mean evolution\ncompared with the dispersion found in radio galaxies, especially beyond z >1. This dispersion is most probably\ndue to a correlation between the absolute magnitude of\nthe HGs and the radio power. Therefore, the most powerful radio quasars inhabit the most luminous HGs. The\nabsolute magnitudes of the host and nuclear source (and\nthis last parameter and radio power) are also correlated.\nThese correlations are most probably due to a correlation\nof all three parameters with the central black hole mass\n(McLure et al 1999). Dunlop et al. (2001) found that this\ntendency is seen both in radio-loud and radio-quiet samples, which could imply that the same mechanism produces the radio emission in both kinds of AGN.\nIn a toy scenario, succesive merging processes could\nincrease the mass of the spheroidal component of the HG,\nincreasing its luminosity. These merging processes would\nfeed the nuclear AGN, increasing also the mass of the central black hole. This will also increase the nuclear luminosity and radio power. This scenario is consistent with\nthe result that indicates that radio-quiet quasars inhabit\nless-populated areas than radio-loud quasars (Hall et al.\n1998). S\u00e1nchez & Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano (1999) and S\u00e1nchez\n& Gonz\u00e1lez-Serrano (2002) have found that QSOs inhabit\nthe outer regions of clusters (instead of the core) where a\ncollision is more likely to produce a merger. Recent morphological analysis of HGs of different families of AGNs at\nz<0.3 found no traces of recent merging processes (Dunlop\net al. 2001). This could indicate an evolution in the merging rate, although much more detailed studies are needed\nbefore a conclusion can be reached.\nThe global scenario suggested by the results presented\nin this article has to be tested. The first obvious step would\nbe to increase the fraction of detected HGs in order to re-\n\n17\n\nduce the biases, and to extend the studies to other samples\nwith higher and lower radio powers. Photometric studies\nof the HGs at other wavelengths, and spectroscopy of them\nand their near companions are needed to determine better the evolution of these galaxies, and search for possible\ntraces of merging processes.\nAcknowledgements.
