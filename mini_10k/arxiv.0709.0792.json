At a fixed temperature and increasing the spinning frequency, the swimmer demonstrates\na transition from dissipation-dominated to a pumping-dominated motion regime characterized by\nnegative effective friction coefficient. In the limit of high frequencies, the diffusion of the swimmer\ncan be described by a model of an active particle with constant velocity.\n\nAttention of physics community to the problem of swimming at low Reynolds numbers, which is relevant for the\nworld of microorganisms, was attracted by Edward Purcell in seventies [1]. He formulated the basic principles of\nself-propulsion and suggested a variety of simple model microswimmers that would propel themselves in the Stokesian\nregime using non-reciprocal cyclic moves. The most famous of them, three-link swimmer, was solved analytically only\nrecently [2]. As the Stokesian regime is characterized by the absence of time in the flow equations, the description of\nself-propulsion reduces to a purely geometrical problem of transformation of the microswimmer's body shape. The\nproblem was solved for various nearly spherical objects, whose surface is deformed by a wave-like perturbation in the\nmanner of ciliated microorganisms [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A number of other simple models performing one- or two-dimensional\nnon-reciprocal moves as well as their swimming performance were discussed recently [8, 9, 10].\nRecent advances in micromanipulation techniques made it possible to construct artificial swimmers mimicking the\nbacterial and protozoal self-propulsion mechanisms. Most of these machines, however, are supposed to be driven by\nan external fields rather than ATP hydrolysis. The first working device imitating the flagellum beating and driven by\nan external magnetic field was reported recently [11]. Realistic implementations of DNA-based nanomachines using\nthe ratchet principle were also suggested [12, 13]. Other directions in development of self-propelling micromachines\nis related to use of anisotropic environments, active surfaces or chemical reactions, whose mechanical response has\nan inherent asymmetry [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The focus of these publications is the propulsion mechanism as such\nand the dynamics of a swimmer on long timescales is usually not addressed. One should note, however, that on the\nnanometer and micrometer scale the thermal fluctuations are expected to compete with the propulsion mechanisms\nand, therefore, the interplay between the swimming and dissipation processes is of great interest [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].\nIn this work, we report on general dynamic properties of a microswimmer at finite temperatures.\nFor our study we chose a simple model swimmer, consisting of three spheres with their centers comprising an\nequilateral triangle. The distances between the spheres are fixed. To impose propulsion, we make the spheres spin via\napplied constant torque. We arrange the torque directions as shown in Fig. 1a so that the net torque is always zero.\nThis constraint mimics the rotation due to internal degrees of freedom, as it would be in case of a microorganism\nswimming. At the same time, the algorithm allows us to keep control over the amount of supplied energy. The\ndynamics of the three-ball animals was modeled numerically using a hybrid molecular dynamics/ Lattice Boltzmann\n(LB) simulation method [27, 28]. The spheres were modeled with the raspberry setup (a tethered network of point\nparticles wrapped around a big Lennard-Jones (LJ) bead) [28] with the radius R = 3, while the links by the massless\nharmonic bonds of length L = 10 of high spring constant between the ball centers. The length units are defined by\nthe LB cell size. Most simulations were performed in a cubic box of side 40 units with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe dynamic viscosity of the fluid in the LJ units was set to \u03b7 = 2.55 if not specified otherwise, and the temperature\nto T = 5. To simulate the action of finite temperature, a fluctuating stress tensor technique was used and in addition\nstochastic random force was applied to each of the beads composing the swimmer [27]. The velocity of each bead v\nis then calculated from the following Langevin equation\nm\n\ndv\n= \u2212\u03b6(v \u2212 u(r)) + f (t) + Fext + Fint\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the bead mass, \u03b6 the friction coefficient, u(r)) the interpolated fluid velocity at the particle position r, f (t) is\na Gaussian white noise force with zero mean, whose strength is given via the standard fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nin the absence of the external force, Fint the interaction force between different beads comprising the raspberry (see\nRef. [28] for details), and Fext the \"external\" force driving the sphere rotation. The magnitudeP\nof the external force\nwas chosen to produce the desired spinning velocity \u03c9= T/(8\u03b7\u03c0R3 ), where the net torque T = i \u03c1i * Fi is a sum of\n\n\f2\n\nR\n\nL\n\n\u03c9\n\nFIG. 1: The construction scheme of the three-ball swimmer: The balls are spinning around the in-plane axes so that the angular\nvelocities \u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 +\u03c9 3 = 0. A simulation snapshot on the right hand side illustrates the raspberry model implementation of\nthe swimmer.\n\nthe moments acting on each surface beadP\nof the sphere, \u03c1 is the distance from the rotation axis to the ith bead. The\nenergy influx is then given by a sum \u03b5 = i F * vi over all beads constituting the spheres or simply \u03b5 = T*\u03c9.\nMotion of the swimmer at zero temperature can be easily understood in the limit of small spheres and long links.\nEach sphere can be then represented by a rotlet [29]\nv(r) =\n\nR3\n\u03c9\u00d7r\nr3\n\n(2)\n\nWe have to find the flow field produced by two small spheres at the location of the third one and take just sum of\ntheir the components normal to the plane containing the three sphere centers, as the other components cancel.

Despite\nthe large ball size as compared to the link length, the equation gives a very good velocity estimate with relative\ndeviation from the simulation data less than 4% up to \u03c9 = 2. The result given by Eq. (3) can be also be compared\nto the propulsion speed of a twirling ring, which corresponds to a generalization of the three-ball animal to the case\nof infinite number of balls filling a full circle of radius r [12, 13]:\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\nR2\n1\n8\nv0 =\n\u2212\n(4)\n\u03c9 ln\n2r\nR\n2\nThe propulsion efficiency of this swimmer can be estimated as a relation of the energy dissipated in the forward\nthrust to the energy dissipated in the sphere spinning, which gives\n\u03b2=\n\nFft v0\nT*\u03c9\n\n(5)\n\nThe steady state thrust force Fft is equal to the total friction force Ff due to forward motion of the three-ball\nswimmer, which is related to the corresponding mobility as Ff = \u2212v0 /\u03bc3 . If the hydrodynamic interactions between\nthe spheres are taken into account in the stokeslet approximation (the mobility of a pair of stokeslets to the first order\nin r\u22121 is \u03bc2 = \u03bc21 (1 + 43 Rr )), we get for the triplet\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc1\n3R\n\u03bc3 =\n1+2\n\u2248 0.63\u03bc1\n(6)\n3\n4L\nwhere \u03bc1 = (6\u03c0\u03b7R)\u22121 for the motion transversal to the triangle plane.

The efficiency is then \u03b2 \u2248 0.5(R/L)4 ,\nwhich reaches its maximum of about 6% for contacting spheres.\nWe now study the motion of the swimmer at finite temperatures. Typical two-dimensional projections of the\nswimmer's trajectories observed at different ball spinning frequencies are plotted in Fig. 3. One can see that the\ncharacter of the motion is changing significantly on increasing the frequency: the trajectories become more persistent\nwith more extended straight segments and less abrupt changes of the direction. As a result, the swimmer with a\nhigher \u03c9 travels over longer distances within the same time as compared with a less active one.\nThe mean-square displacements (MSD) of the swimmer's center of mass are shown in Fig. 4a for four different\nspinning frequencies and three different temperatures. We see immediately, that the higher spinning frequencies\ncorrespond to a higher MSD, i.e. to the higher diffusivity. The shape of the MSD curves clearly indicates the\nexistence of two distinct dynamic regimes: the driven motion at t \u2264 500 where h\u2206r2 i \u221d t2 and the diffusive motion at\nt > 1000 where h\u2206r2 i \u221d t. In the case of high propulsion speeds, the transition from the deterministic driven motion to\na random walk happens due to rotational diffusion of the swimmer. The \"ballistic part\" of the MSD coincides for the\nswimmers with the same frequency but different temperatures. In contrast, the random walk part is thermosensitive:\nhigher temperature leads to a lower diffusivity. The transition between the two regimes happens on the characteristic\ntimescale of rotational diffusion. The diffusion coefficient measured from the asymptotic behaviour of the swimmer\nat long times, Deff , is plotted in Fig. 4b. We see that the measured diffusion coefficient grows nonlinearly with the\ndrift velocity (or the spinning frequency as v0 \u221d \u03c9).\nA simplest model describing the diffusion of an active swimmer moving with a constant velocity v0 , whose direction of\nmotion changes due to rotational diffusion with a diffusion constant Dr , gives the diffusion coefficient Deff = 2v02 /Dr .\nThis expression follows immediately from a reformulation of the known result for the end-to-end distance of a persistent\npolymer chain, which is h\u2206r2 i = 2lp L, lp being the persistence length and L the contour length of the chain. In the\nswimmer variables, the persistence length of the trajectory is lp = \u03c4 v0 , where \u03c4 is the rotational correlation time,\nand its contour length is simply proportional to time: L = tv0 . Then, Deff = h\u2206r2 i/6t = v02 \u03c4 /3 [20]. The time\n\u03c4 is defined via the orientational correlation function of the swimmer hn(0) * n(t)i, where n is the normal vector to\nthe plane of the triangle connecting the sphere centers. In case of random uncorrelated fluctuations, the correlation\nfunction decays at short times exponentially with time as hn(0) * n(t)i = e\u2212t/\u03c4 . In case of an anisotropic rotation, one\ncan expect that the decay is governed by the smallest correlation time, i.e. by the characteristic time of rotation in\nthe direction with the smallest friction torque. The shortest orientational relaxation time expected for this swimmer\ncorresponds to a rotation around the in-plane axis passing through the center of one ball and through the middle of\nthe spring connecting the opposite ones. With a first order correction for hydrodynamic interaction between the balls\nwe get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u03c0\u03b7L2 R\n1\n3\n8\u03c0\u03b7R +\n(7)\n\u03c4=\nkB T\n1 \u2212 3R/2L\n\n\f4\n\n600\n\n40\n\n400\n\nY\n\n0\n\n0\n\n40\n\n200\n\u03c9=0\n0.12\n0.24\n0.48\n\n0\n\n-200\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nX\n\nFIG. 3: Two-dimensional XY projection of the trajectories of the swimmer's center of mass position obtained with different\nball spinning frequencies at T = 5. The insert shows the magnified view of the initial part of the trajectories.\n\nThis formula gives \u03c4 = 2250, 1350, and 675 for T = 3, 5, and 10, respectively. This values are close to what we\nobserve in simulation at low \u03c9. If we use this correlation time to predict the translational self-diffusion coefficient, the\nagreement with the measured data is convincing (the solid curves in Fig. 4b). We also tested our assumption regarding\nthe orientational correlation time by direct measurement of the correlation function of the swimmer trajectories. From\nthese measurements at low spinning frequencies we get \u03c4 = 2300 \u00b1 200, 1300 \u00b1 200 and 700 \u00b1 100 for T = 3, 5,\nand 10, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the estimated correlation times. In what concerns\nthe assumption of constant velocity along the trajectory, we can check the swimmer's velocity distribution. The\ncharacteristic distributions of the velocity component perpendicular to the triangle plane (i.e. parallel to the thrust\nforce) for T = 3 are shown in Fig.5. While at \u03c9 = 0.24 the variance is comparable to the mean velocity, at the\nhighest frequency, \u03c9 = 1.2, it does not exceed 25% of the mean. So, we see that the swimmer's velocity is narrowly\ndistributed around v0 and that also this assumption is justified. Thus, the swimmer's motion, especially at the high\nball spinning frequencies (or energy influx rates) fits well the model of an active Brownian particle [21, 23], whose\nvelocity is fairly constant in the magnitude while the direction is subject to thermal fluctuations. In other properties\nwe observe more analogies to the active Brownian particle model. For example, the existence of a finite preferential\nvelocity in our model is also reflected in the velocity distribution function shown in Fig. 5. Instead of a maximum at\nv = 0 characteristic for systems in thermal equilibrium (the Maxwell distribution) it possesses two maxima at \u00b1vp\nand a minimum at v = 0.\nAt v02 > hv 2 (\u03c9 = 0)i we expect that the character of the swimmer's motion changes. As it was mentioned above,\nthe characteristic velocity v0 is a function of the energy influx rate, while the variance is fixed by the temperature and\nthe swimmer mass: hv 2 i = 3kB T /M , and characterizes the energy dissipation rate. Thus, the transition is expected at\n\u03c9 = kB T L4 /(R6 M ). The threshold values of the frequency are \u03c9 \u2248 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 (or v0 = 0.13, 0.23, and 0.45) for\nT = 3, 5 and 10, respectively. At the higher frequencies, other signatures of the driven regime can be observed, such\nas negative friction coefficient [23]. The friction coefficient can be extracted from the relation between the swimmer\nacceleration a and its instant velocity v . We calculated these values by averaging over three velocity/acceleration\ncomponents. The result for different spinning frequencies is shown in Fig. 6, top. As there is no other external\nforces acting of the swimmer, the acceleration is resulting from the viscous friction a = Ffr /M = \u2212\u03b3(v)v/M . Here,\nthe effective friction coefficient \u03b3(v) is a function of the instant velocity. The a(v) curves for the lowest spinning\nfrequency are fairly linear at low velocities, which corresponds to a constant positive friction coefficient. The curves\nbend toward smaller friction at the higher frequencies, and at the highest one all the curves cross zero and display\na region of positive acceleration. All the a(v) curves show two linear regions: one at v \u2192 0 and another one at the\nhigher velocities. The corresponding nonlinear friction coefficient is plotted in Fig. 6, bottom. There we indeed notice\nsaturation both at low velocities and at high v. While the limiting values \u03b3(v \u2192 0) shows strong dependence on\nthe energy influx rate, the high velocity values seem to tend to a temperature independent limit, which only slightly\ndecreases with the ball spinning frequency. We also notice that the parts of the curves with the acceleration parallel\n\n\f5\n8\n\n10\n\nt\nT=3\nT=5\nT=10\n\n6\n\n2\n\n<\u2206r >\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\u03c9=1.8\n\u03c9=0.9\n\u03c9=0.48\n\u03c9=0.24\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\ntime\nT=3\nT=5\nT=10\n\nDeff\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\nV\n\nFIG. 4: Top: Mean-square displacement of the swimmer as a function of the ball spinning frequency and temperature.

Bottom: The corresponding effective friction coefficient as a function of the swimmer's velocity.\n\nto the instant velocity correspond to \u03b3(v) < 0. One can see that the transition into the driven regime with negative\n\u03b3 occurs on increasing \u03c9. At T = 3 and T = 5 the negative friction appears at \u03c9 = 0.9 and 1.2, at T = 10 only\nat \u03c9 = 1.2, in agreement with the above estimates. The values vp , at which the friction coefficient turns zero reflect\ntherefore the preferential stationary velocity, at which the viscous resistance of the medium is exactly balanced by\nthe swimmer's forward thrust.\nWe would like to note also that the behaviour of the friction coefficient qualitatively resembles the velocity dependence predicted within the active Brownian particle model [23]. In the adiabatic approximation the effective friction\na\nfor a particle with an internal energy depot should vary as \u03b3(v) = \u03b30 \u2212 b+v\n2 , where the coefficient a is proportional\nto the energy influx rate. If applied to our case, the \u03b30 would be the Stokesian viscous friction experienced by the\nswimmer. The negative values of the nonlinear friction coefficient can be observed provided that \u03b3(v) turns negative\nat finite velocities, which requires that a > \u03b30 (b + v 2 ). We can see from Fig.6 at 0.24 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 0.9 that the shape of the\nfriction curves \u03b3(v) shows a similar behaviour.\nFinally, we would like to note that the parameters of this system were chosen to demonstrate the wide range\nof dynamic properties. In case of a micrometer size living swimmers, the role of thermal fluctuations might be\nsignificantly smaller. Living microswimmers moving at the velocities of 10\u03bcm/s would rather demonstrate the driven\nmotion regime. Still, in presence of a stochasticity caused by internal mechanisms of the animal or spatial/temporal\ninhomogeneities of the medium, its competition with the deterministic drive would lead to qualitatively similar results.\nOn the other hand, slow and small swimmers like the artificial ones, suggested in literature, would demonstrate many\nfeatures described in this work even with thermal fluctuations. Another parameter that differentiates the dynamics\nstudied in the present work from the biological microorganisms is the relatively high Reynolds number that reaches\nRemax \u2248 3 for the highest velocities considered. So, the role of inertial effects is considerably overestimated as\ncompared to the microworld. Our tests, however, showed that none of the reported properties can be attributed solely\n\n\f7\nto inertia and we expect our predictions to be valid also for the typical microscopic objects.\nWe studied dynamics properties of a self-propelling microswimmer engine subjected to thermal fluctuations. Our\nmodel for the first time treats explicitly both the propulsion mechanics and fluctuations and demonstrates a rich\ninterplay of these factors. Qualitatively, many of the observed properties (such as the non-linear velocity-dependent\nfriction coefficient, characteristic crater-like velocity distributions at high energy influx rates, etc.) resemble those of\nthe model of active Brownian particle [21, 23]. The differences related to the fluctuations of the propulsive effort, the\nbroad velocity distributions, three-dimensional motion, and anisotropic friction, result in general in a more complex\ndynamic behaviour, which we hope will stimulate further theoretical effort in this field.\nWe are grateful R.
