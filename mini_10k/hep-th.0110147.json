The baryon operator is also\nconstructed.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNoncommutative geometry of the form\n[x\u03bc , x\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nhas got a lot of interest recently. (See [1, 2, 3] for a comprehensive introduction and an extensive\nlist of references.) Part of the reason is because it appears in a certain corner of moduli space\nof string [4, 5, 6] and M theory [7, 8] and so cannot be ignored.\nNoncommutative gauge theory with gauge group U(N) has been constructed and analysed\nquite extensively in the literature. It was first pointed out in [1] that there is an obstacle in\nthe naive way to construct noncommutative gauge theory with gauge group other than U(N).\nSince then there had been a number of proposals [9, 10, 11, 12] to construct noncommutative\ngauge theory with gauge group different from U(N).\nIn this letter we propose a construction of noncommutative SU(N) gauge theory. The\nconstruction follows similar ideas as in [9, 11] by imposing a constraint on the noncommutative\nU(N) gauge configurations. The constraint selects out the corresponding gauge configurations\nthat we propose to be identified as noncommutative SU(N) configurations. We also construct\na gauge invariant baryon operator.\n\n2\n\nNoncommutative SU (N )\n\nConsider a noncommutative gauge theory with gauge group U(N). The action is\n1\nS=\n4\n\nZ\n\ndx TrF\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc + ig(A\u03bc \u2217 A\u03bd \u2212 A\u03bd \u2217 A\u03bc )\n\n(3)\n\nand g is the gauge coupling. The gauge transformation is given by\ni\nA\u03bc (x) \u2192 U(x) \u2217 A\u03bc (x) \u2217 U(x)\u2020 \u2212 U(x) \u2217 \u2202\u03bc U(x)\u2020 ,\ng\n\n(4)\n\n\u2020\n\nwhere U(x) \u2208 U(N) with U(x) \u2217 U(x)\u2020 = U(x) \u2217 U(x) = 1.\nThe Wilson line in noncommutative gauge theories is defined by\nW (x, C) = P\u2217 exp ig\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n!\n\nd\u03b6 \u03bc\nA\u03bc (x + \u03b6(\u03c3)) ,\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere C is the curve\nC = {\u03b6 \u03bc(\u03c3), 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1 | \u03b6(0) = 0, \u03b6(1) = l},\n\n(6)\n\nand P\u2217 is the path ordering with respect to the star product\nW (x, C) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(ig)n\n\nn=0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\nd\u03c31\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u03c31\n\nd\u03c32 ...\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3n \u03b6\u03bc1 (\u03c31 )...\u03b6\u03bcn (\u03c3n )A\u03bc1 (x + \u03b6(\u03c31 )) \u2217 ... \u2217 A\u03bcn (x + \u03b6(\u03c3n )).\n\n\u03c3n\u22121\n\n(7)\n\nIt is easy to verify that W (x, C) transforms under a gauge transformation as\n\u2020\n\nW (x, C) \u2192 U(x) \u2217 W (x, C) \u2217 U (x + l) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe open Wilson line is an important building block for constructing gauge invariant operators\n[13, 14]. The crucial observation is that in noncommutative geometry (1), the plane wave eikx\nis a translational operator\neikx \u2217 f (x) = f (x + \u03b8k) \u2217 eikx ,\n(9)\ntherefore one can construct gauge invariant operators with the help of the open Wilson line.\nLet O(x) be an operator transforming in the adjoint (e.g. TrF n ), i.e.\n\u2020\n\nO(x) \u2192 U(x) \u2217 O(x) \u2217 U (x) ,\nthen one can introduce\n\u00d5(k) :=\n\nZ\n\ndx O(x) \u2217 W (x, Ck ) \u2217 eikx ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere the subscript k of Ck denotes the possible k dependence of the contour. \u00d5(k) is a\ngeneralization of the Fourier transform of the operator O to the noncommutative case. It\nreduces to the usual Fourier transform in the commutative limit. The tilde reminds us that\n\u00d5(k) is not exactly the usual Fourier transform of O(x). It is easy to show that the following\nmomentum space operator\nTr \u00d5(k),\n(12)\nis gauge invariant if Ck satisfies the condition\nl\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd k\u03bd .\n\n(13)\n\nAlthough (13) is sufficient to guarantee gauge invariance, straight contours play a special role.\nThen the insertion point for O on Ck is arbitrary [14] and in addition one has the remarkable\nidentity [15, 16]\neik(x\u2212g\u03b8A(x))\n= W (x, Ck ) \u2217 eikx .\n(14)\n\u2217\nThe subscript \u2217 on the l.h.s. indicates that the exponential is understood as a power series of\nthe star multiplied exponent. The combination x \u2212 g\u03b8A(x) is just the covariant coordinate in\nthe sense of [17]. From now on we always choose straight contours.\nTo construct noncommutative gauge theory with gauge group SU(N), we can try to follow\nthe approach of [9, 11] by imposing constraints on the gauge configurations A and gauge\ntransformation parameters of the noncommutative U(N). For finding a suitable constraint\n3\n\n\fto fix a noncommutative version of SU(N) (we denote it from now by ncSU(N) ) it is helpful\nto recall the reason why simple tensoring SU(N) with the star product fails. If one imposes\nTr\u03bb(x) = 0 to single out the modified ncSU(N) Lie algebra, it turns out that this condition\ndue to the non-commutativity of the star product does not close, i.e. Tr[\u03bb(x), \u03bc(x)]\u2217 6= 0. A\nformulation of the same problem in terms of U(N) group elements would impose the vanishing\ntrace condition on the Maurer-Cartan form, i.e. Tr(U \u2020 \u2217dU) = 0. Since Tr((U \u2217V )\u2020 \u2217d(U \u2217V )) =\nTr(V \u2020 \u2217 U \u2020 \u2217 dU \u2217 V ) + Tr(U \u2020 \u2217 dU), we see again that the lack of cyclic invariance under the\nmatrix trace prevents U \u2217 V to fulfil the constraint if U and V do separately. Cyclic invariance\nis restored if the total trace with respect to internal indices and the spacetime points is taken.\nR\nNow certainly dxTr(U \u2020 \u2217 dU) = 0 is too weak and one should look for a localized version,\ni.e. in the language of Fourier transforms for an extension from momentum k = 0 to generic\nk 6= 0. This problem is similar to the one described above in connection with the construction\nof gauge invariant quantities.\nMotivated by these remarks we impose the following constraint on the allowed gauge field\nconfigurations:\nTr \u00c3(k) :=\n\nZ\n\ndx Tr(A(x) \u2217 W (x, Ck )) \u2217 eikx = 0 ,\n\n\u2200k .\n\n(15)\n\nThe constraint (15) is a condition on the allowed gauge configurations A of U(N) that can be\nidentified as ncSU(N) configurations. It is the generalization of the traceless condition for the\ncommutative SU(N) gauge fields. Under a gauge transformation, it transforms as\nTr \u00c3(k) \u2192 Tr \u00c3(k) +\n\ni\ng\n\nZ\n\ndxTr(U \u2020 (x) \u2217 dU(x) \u2217 W (x, Ck )) \u2217 eikx .\n\n(16)\n\nSo in order for (15) to be gauge invariant, we need to impose the condition\nZ\n\ndx Tr (U \u2020 (x) \u2217 dU(x) \u2217 W (x, Ck )) \u2217 eikx = 0 ,\n\n\u2200k ,\n\nfor x-dependent U,\n\n(17)\n\non the allowed gauge transformations. Note that the allowed gauge transformation U(x) is\ngenerally a gauge field dependent gauge transformation. Strictly speaking we should write U A .\nIn the following we will drop the superscript and simply write U. This is to be distinguished from\nthe case of noncommutative U(N). In the commutative limit, (17) reduces to the usual traceless\ncondition Tr(d\u03bb) = 0 where U = exp i\u03bb \u2208 SU(N). For x-independent gauge transformations,\nthe condition (17) gives no extra information and it is natural to consider gauge transformations\nthat are traceless\nTr \u03bb = 0, for x-independent U = ei\u03bb .\n(18)\nThus we propose that (15),(17) and (18) together provide a characterization of noncommutative\nncSU(N) gauge configurations.\nFurthermore, we note the following composition law for our ncSU(N). Denote the constraint\n(17) as f (U, A) = 0 and as AU the gauge transform of A according to (4), then one has the\ncomposition law\nf (V \u2217 U, A) = f (V, AU ) + f (U, A)\n(19)\n4\n\n\ffor ncSU(N). This ensures the consistency of imposing (15) and (17) under successive gauge\ntransformations.\nBefore closing this section we want to comment on the issue of nontrivial solutions for\nour constraints. Both constraints are understood to be imposed for any k. Therefore, an\nequivalent form of (15) and (17) which no longer contains k would be highly welcome. For the\ncommutative case \u03b8 = 0 the Wilson line W is absent and we have the situation of standard\nFourier transformation. Vanishing of the Fourier transform of TrA for all k is equivalent to\nTrA = 0 for all x. Our aim is to get for \u03b8 6= 0 a similar pure coordinate space constraint. To this\ngoal let us expand W and further Taylor expand the appearing A(x+\u03c3\u03b8k). All arising factors of\nk can be thought as generated by differentiations of eikx . Then these differentiations, by partial\nintegrations, will be moved to the remaining factors in the x-integral. Under this integral the\n\u2217 in front of eikx can be dropped and we arrive at the standard Fourier transformation of an\ninfinite power series in A, \u03b8, \u2202. Performing these manipulations explicitly we find up to O(\u03b83 )\n\u0012\n\ni\nTr A\u03bd \u2212 g(\u03b8\u2202)\u03bc (A\u03bd \u2217 A\u03bc ) \u2212 g(\u03b8\u2202)\u03bc1 (\u03b8\u2202)\u03bc2 (A\u03bd \u2217 \u2202\u03bc1 A\u03bc2 )\n2\n\u0013\n1\n+ g 2 (\u03b8\u2202)\u03bc1 (\u03b8\u2202)\u03bc2 (A\u03bd \u2217 A\u03bc1 \u2217 A\u03bc2 ) + O(\u03b83 ) = 0 .\n2\n\n(20)\n\nThe corresponding equivalent to (17) is obtained by replacing A\u03bd by U \u2020 \u2202\u03bd U and keeping the\nA\u03bc . While obviously all finite order approximations have nontrivial solutions, at this level of\ndiscussions it is far from obvious whether the infinite power series allows for solutions.\nHowever one can nevertheless find an argument for the existence of nontrivial solutions. Let\nus define (A similar construction for quantities transforming in the adjoint has been used in\n[16].)\n1 Z\n\u00c2(y) =\ndk e\u2212iky \u00c3(k)\n(21)\n(2\u03c0)D\nand similar for U \u2020 \u2202\u03bd U. Then Tr\u00c3(k) = 0 for all k is equivalent to Tr\u00c2(y) = 0 for all y. The\nmap A \u2192 \u00c2 is a map of coordinate space functions. For \u03b8 = 0 it is the identity map hence\ninvertible. Assuming that continuity ensures invertibility also for \u03b8 6= 0 we have nontrivial\nsolutions of our constraints for free.\nThe vacuum configuration A = 0 has a distinguished position. Then W = 1 and (17) says\nthe admissible ncSU(N) gauge transformations satisfy\nZ\n\ndx Tr (U \u2020 (x) \u2217 dU(x)) \u2217 eikx = 0 ,\n\n\u2200k .\n\n(22)\n\nThis is equivalent to Tr (U \u2020 (x) \u2217 dU(x)) = 0 and on substituting to (4) implies that then\nA = idU \u2217 U \u2020 /g, is also a ncSU(N) configuration.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nGauge invariant baryon operator\n\nWe start with a commutative gauge theory with a color gauge group SU(N) 1 . Let q i be a set\nof fermionic fields in the fundamental representations of SU(N). They transform under SU(N)\nas\nq i \u2192 Uji q j , U \u2208 SU(N) .\n(23)\nOne can introduce the operator\nM i j = q i q\u0304j .\nIt transforms as\n\n(24)\n\u2020\n\nM \u2192U M U .\n\n(25)\n\nA set of SU(N) gauge invariant operators can be constructed from powers of M as\nTr M n ,\n\nn = 1, 2, * * * .\n\n(26)\n\nIn addition, the determinant DetM can be related to traces of powers of M using the formula\nX\n\nDetM =\n\nn1 +2n2 +...+N nN =N\n\ncn(N1 n)2 ...nN (TrM)n1 (TrM 2 )n2 ...(TrM N )nN ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhich e.g. for N = 2, 3 means\n\u0011\n1\u0010\nTrM 2 \u2212 (TrM)2 , N = 2\n2\n1\n1\n1\nTrM 3 \u2212 TrMTrM 2 + (TrM)3 ,\nDetM =\n3\n2\n6\n\nDetM = \u2212\n\nN =3.\n\n(28)\n\nIn the commutative case, the standard gauge invariant baryon operator is given by\nB(x) =\n\n1\n\u01ebi i ***i q i1 (x) * * * q iN (x) .\nN! 1 2 N\n\n(29)\n\nThe magnitude of this baryon operator B is related to DetM through the formula\nDetM = N! BB \u2020 .\n\n(30)\n\nUp to now we have related the absolute value of the baryon operator to traces of powers of M,\nwhich transform in the adjoint.\nThis can be used as a starting point for the definition of the square of the absolute value of a\nbaryon operator in the noncommutative case. We know how to form gauge invariant quantities\nout of operators transforming in the adjoint. Therefore we define\nN!BB \u2020 (y) :=\n\nX\n\nn1 +2n2 +...+N nN =N\n1\n\nWe suppress flavor and spin indices.\n\n)\nn1\nn2\nnN\nd\nd2\nN\nc(N\n,\nn1 n2 ...nN (TrM\u0302(y)) (TrM (y)) ...(TrM (y))\n\n6\n\n(31)\n\n\fwith\ndj (y) =\nM\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)D\n\nZ\n\ngj (k) .\ndk e\u2212iky M\n\n(32)\n\nThe quantity defined by (26) is gauge invariant under noncommutative U(N) and reproduces\nN!BB \u2020 (y) with B(y) given by (29) in the commutative limit. The phase of B remains undetermined in the construction just presented. No use has been made of the ncSU(N) constraint.\nTo proceed with a different construction, we consider Wilson lines for contours C running\nto infinity, in particular W (x, C\u221e ) with\nC\u221e = {\u03b6 \u03bc (\u03c3), 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1 | \u03b6(0) = \u221e, \u03b6(1) = 0} .\n\n(33)\n\nThey transform under the gauge transformation (4) as\nW (x, C\u221e ) \u2192 U(\u221e) \u2217 W (x, C\u221e ) \u2217 U \u2020 (x) .\n\n(34)\n\nFor gauge transformation that are trivial at infinity, i.e. U(\u221e) = 1, this becomes\nW (x, C\u221e ) \u2192 W (x, C\u221e ) \u2217 U \u2020 (x),\n\n(35)\n\nwhich effectively is a transformation in the anti-fundamental representation. Using W (x, C\u221e ),\none can construct the manifestly gauge invariant combination W \u2217 q and use it as the building\nblock for a gauge invariant baryon operator. We define in the x-space the following operator\nB(x) =\n\n1\n\u01ebi1 ***iN (W i1 j1 \u2217 q j1 ) \u2217 * * * \u2217 (W iN jN \u2217 q jN ) .\nN!\n\n(36)\n\nNote that B is manifestly gauge invariant for all noncommutative U(N) transformations approaching the identity at infinity, and not just for ncSU(N) ones. However, one should nevertheless restrict oneself to noncommutative SU(N) configuration in the definition (36) of B.\nIndeed in the commutative limit,\nB(x) = Det W (x, C\u221e ) * B(x)\n\n(37)\n\nwhere B given by (29) is the usual baryon operator. Thus B = B only if A is in commutative\nSU(N), since then\nDet W (x, C\u221e ) = 1, in the commutative limit.\n(38)\nJust this limiting property is realised if the ncSU(N) constraint (15) is imposed.\nWe also note that our baryon B is invariant with respect to the rigid, i.e. x-independent,\nSU(N) gauge transformations since constants can be factored out of the star products.\nFinally we remark that the construction in this section by parallel transporting the quarks\nfrom infinity works so long as the Wilson loop in anti-fundamental representation (35) can be\nconstructed. The correct commutative limit is guaranteed by (38). For example, our construction here can be applied equally well to [10, 12].\n7\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussions\n\nIn this paper, we have proposed a definition of noncommutative SU(N). We would like to\ncomment on the relation of our work to other approaches to the construction of noncommutative\ngauge theories beyond U(N). Working with enveloping algebra valued gauge fields whose\ncomponents are functions of standard Lie algebra valued fields, noncommutative gauge theories\nhave been constructed for arbitrary Lie algebras [10, 12]. The construction is based on the\nuse of the Seiberg-Witten map. For practical calculations this map is treatable as a power\nexpansion in \u03b8 only. Since our main motivation was the construction of physical relevant gauge\ninvariant quantities in all orders of \u03b8, we followed another approach, namely the use of suitable\nconstraints within noncommutative U(N). Our constraint for ncSU(N) differs qualitatively\nfrom those used for the noncommutative versions of O(N) and Usp(2N) [9, 11]. The new\nfeature is the dependence of the gauge transformation constraint on the gauge field. Thinking\nin terms of covariant coordinates [17], this seems to be a quite generic feature in noncommutative\ngeometry.\nJust this property reminds one a little bit on the dependence of the noncommutative gauge\ntransformation both on the commutative one and the commutative gauge field within the\nSeiberg-Witten map. Nevertheless a sketchy look at the U(N) SW map indicates that, to lowest\norder in \u03b8, the images of commutative SU(N) fields do not necessarily obey our constraint. This\nwould imply that our noncommutative version of SU(N) is different from the one constructed\nalong the lines of [10, 12].\nThe consideration in this paper is mostly a classical one. Our constraint is motivated purely\nfrom the field theory side. It is possible that the noncommutative SU(N) gauge theory is an\neffective description of a certain string construction. It would also be interesting to see if there\nis a dual description in terms of gravity. An interesting related issue is to understand the\nexistence of the baryon vertex operator from the AdS/CFT point of view [14, 18, 19]. However\nthese are completely open for the moment.\nOn the other hand, one may try to think of the noncommutative SU(N) gauge theory\nas a quantum theory and try to analyse its quantum properties. As a first step, one needs\na correct implementation of the constraint at the quantum level, for example using the Dirac\nquantization. It would be interesting to perform an one loop analysis similar to those in [20, 21]\nand clarify its relation to that for noncommutative U(N).\nOn the more phenomenological level, it may be interesting to adopt our construction of the\nnoncommutative SU(N) and the baryon operator in studying standard model with noncommutative SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge symmetry.\nIt would also be interesting to generalize our construction to include matters transforming\nin other nontrivial representations other than the fundamental representation of the noncommutative SU(N) by imposing an appropriate set of constraints.\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nC.S.C. would like to thank the warm hospitality of the theoretical physics group of the Humboldt\nUniversity where this work was initiated.
