Introduction\n\nK\n\nIn a recent paper, Edvardsson et al.(2002) propose a new\nsolution for the spin evolution of the Earth and Mars.\nConsidering the absence of a precise evaluation of the errors due to the integrator and the absence of relativity in\nthe model, one could discuss the use of the word 'accurate'\nin the title of the paper, but unfortunately there are some\nmore important flaws in this paper. In their integration of\nthe spin of Mars, the authors found that the integration\nof the spin changes in a large amount when Phobos and\nDeimos are taken into account (see their Fig.12). They also\nnotice that their \" curve without the moons is very similar\nto the curve given by Bouquillon & Souchay (1999) \", who\nincluded the moons. In fact, the paper of Edvardsson et\nal.(2002) is largely in error on this point.\n\nk\nEquator(t)\n\nv\n\nj\n\ni\nI\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u03b8\nu\n\n\u03b5\n\nJ\nEJ2000\n\nN\n\nFig. 1.\n\n2.

Discussion\n\n1\n3\n\nbulge of the planet. In the case of a close satellite, it was\nshown (Goldreich, 1965, Kinoshita, 1993) that instead of\nprecessing around the normal K to the orbital plane (I, J),\nwith a roughly constant inclination i with respect to (I, J),\nthe satellite will precess with respect to k with a nearly\nconstant inclination i\u2032 with respect to the equator plane\n(i, j). In this case, all the previous study is still valid, but\nthe orbit of the satellite is now referred to the equatorial\nreference frame (i, j, k), and the second averaging is made\nwith respect to the longitude of the node, \u03a9\u2032 , of the satellite orbit with respect to the equatorial plane (i, j). The\naverage expression (6, 7) is still valid, when replacing \u03a9\nand i by \u03a9\u2032 and i\u2032 . The average < M >\u03a9\u2032 will then be\ngiven by (8), after changing i with i\u2032 , but this expression is\nnow obtained in the reference frame of the planet (i, j, k).\nAs k \u2227 kk\u03c4 k = k \u2227 k = 0, we have now for the averaged\ntorque\n\n3Gm\n2\u03bd a3 (1 \u2212 e2 )3/2\n\nC \u2212A\n3 sin2 i\n(1 \u2212\n) cos \u03b5\nC\n2\n\n(9)\n\n3. Precession due to a close satellite\nThe previous study is in fact valid uniquely in the case\nof a satellite sufficiently far from the planet, so that the\nprecession of its orbit is mostly driven by the solar perturbations, and not by the torque exerted by the equatorial\n\nThus, contrarily to what is found by Edvardsson et\nal.(2002), the averaged torque exerted by Phobos and\nDeimos on Mars should be null (at first order). The origin of the authors' error can be traced by looking to their\nfigures 1 and 2. The inclination of the satellites with respect to the equator start with a value close to zero at\nthe origin, and then increase up to about 50 degrees and\nthen back to zero with a period of about 6000 and 1500\nyears for Phobos and Deimos, while a back on the enveloppe calculation gives respectively 5400 and 1400 years\nfor the precession of the node of these satellites submitted\nuniquely to solar perturbation. The issue is then clear. By\nneglecting the torque exerted on the satellites orbits by\nthe equatorial bulge of Mars, the authors found that instead of remaining close to the equatorial plane of Mars,\nas demonstrated by Goldreich (1965), the satellites were\nprecessing along the orbital plane. Instead of finding a\nzero value for the mean precession torque (11), they obtain an effect following Eq. (10) which gives a contribution\nof about 0.5\"/year to the precession of mars axis, in agreement with the difference observed by the authors in figure\n12. It is surprising that the authors did not wonder how\nPhobos and Deimos could both be at present with an inclination of less than 2 degrees with respect to the equator\nif they were precessing along the orbit. Goldreich indeed\nrealised more that this 'would amount to an unbelievable\ncoincidence'.\nReferences\nEdvardsson, S., Karlsson, K.G., Engholm, M. 2002, A&A, 384,\n689\u2013701\nMurray, C.
