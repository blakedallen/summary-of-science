Introduction\nThe nucleus of M83 is offset from the bulge centre and surrounded by a semicircular\nstarburst arc (Fig. 1). Harris et al. (2001, hereafter H01) dated the star clusters in the\narc with WFPC2 photometry and found evidence of an age gradients along it. However,\nthe reddening vector parallelled the tracks in the two-colour diagram and clusters may\nbe overlooked or poorly sampled in the visible because of extinction. Thatte et al. (2000,\nhereafter T00) proposed the existence of a second mass concentration after NIR longslit kinematics revealed an additional peak in the velocity dispersion, 2.7\u2032\u2032 SW of the\nnucleus. Further studies with IFUs linked velocity gradients in gas kinematics to hidden\nmass concentrations at different locations: Mast et al. (2006) report a gradient in H\u03b1 at\n3.\u2032\u2032 9\u00b10.\u2032\u2032 5 W of the nucleus while Diaz et al. (2006a; 2006b, hereafter D06a and D06b)\nreport a gradient in Pa\u03b2 7\u2032\u2032 WNW of the nucleus. However, gas kinematics are known\nto suffer non-gravitational effects (Kormendy & Richstone 1995).\nWe have analysed new VLT ISAAC K band long-slit spectroscopy together with\narchival HST data (Pa\u03b1 from NICMOS and H\u03b1 from WFPC2). Fig. 1 illustrates slit\npositions on the HST data. The combined data gives equivalent width (EW) measurements of H\u03b1, Pa\u03b1 and CO (2.3\u03bcm), as well as stellar and gas kinematics.\n\n2. Results\nTo date the star clusters, we use the EWs of the CO bandhead and the H\u03b1 and Pa\u03b1\nemission. We applied Calzetti's extinction law (Calzetti 2001) to correct the H\u03b1 and\nPa\u03b1 EWs. Instantaneous SSP models (Leitherer et al. 1999, hereafter SB99) for H\u03b1,\nPa\u03b1 and CO were incompatible with the data for individual clusters and we investigated\nthe subsequent evolution of a finite episode of star formation by convolving SSP model\nfluxes with a top hat kernel; we found an episode of 6 Myrs fits the data and gives the\nclearest evidence yet of an age gradient along the arc (Fig. 2).\nWe see a gradient in the H2 (2-1 S(1)) gas velocity at the same vicinity as D06a\nreport a gradient in Pa\u03b1 (Fig. 3). However, the stellar velocity dispersion shows no peak\nindicative of a mass concentration; we therefore attribute the gradients to a shock on the\ninner edge of dust lane, as predicted by Athanassoula (1992). At the position reported\nby T00, we also see no clear evidence of a dispersion peak along Slit A.\nAthanassoula (1992) showed that dust-lanes in bars are a consequence of gas on x1\norbits shocking and falling onto x2 orbits. Star formation in the dust lane would usually\nbe opposed due to the shear forces in action along the shocks but we observe the shock\n119\n\n\f120\n\nR. C. W. Houghton & N. Thatte\nFigure 1.

On\nthe outer edge, away from the shock front, where there is likely to be spurs and feathering\n(Bonnell et al. 2006), star formation may be less opposed. Star clusters formed here would\nfall onto x2 orbits to produce the 'star forming arc' and the age gradient.\nFigure 3. Kinematics along slit A.
