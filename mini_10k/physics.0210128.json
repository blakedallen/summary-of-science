Boyer\nDepartment of Physics, City College of the City\nUniversity of New York, New York, NY 10031\n\nAbstract\nA thermodynamic analysis of the harmonic oscillator is presented. Motivation for the study is\nprovided by the blackbody radiation spectrum; when blackbody radiation is regarded as a system of\nnoninteracting harmonic oscillator modes, the thermodynamics follows from that of the harmonic\noscillators. Using the behavior of a harmonic oscillator thermodynamic system under an adiabatic\nchange of oscillator frequency \u03c9, we show that the thermodynamic functions can all be derived from\na single function of \u03c9/T , analogous to Wien's displacement theorem. The high- and low-frequency\nenergy limits allow asymptotic energy forms involving T alone or \u03c9 alone, corresponding to energy\nequipartition and zero-point energy. It is suggested that the \"smoothest possible\" function which\nbehaves as a \u2212 bx at small values of x and vanishes at large x is ae\u2212bx/a because it is a monotonic\nanalytic function every derivative of which is a multiple of the function itself. In this sense, it is\nnoted that the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation corresponds to the function satisfying\nthe Wien displacement result which provides the smoothest possible interpolation between energy\nequipartition at low frequency and zero-point energy at high frequency.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBlackbody radiation holds an unusual place in the physics curriculum. Blackbody radiation provides a simple system which can be used as a model for thermodynamic analysis\nshowing the derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law connecting total radiation energy and\ntemperature[1]. Also, thermal radiation can be regarded as a collection of harmonic radiation modes[2] which can be treated by Doppler shift from a moving piston to obtain the\nWien displacement law relating to the blackbody spectrum[3]. However, the full blackbody\nspectrum is regarded as inaccessible from thermodynamics; rather the blackbody spectrum\nreappears in statistical mechanics where it is used as an illustration of the breakdown of\nclassical statistical mechanics and the need for energy quanta[4].\nIn this article we depart from the traditional points of view. We treat blackbody radiation by analyzing the thermodynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Although the harmonic\noscillator is often discussed in statistical mechanics, it is not usually analyzed in thermodynamics[5]. We begin by noting the expression for the work done by a harmonic oscillator on\nslow change of its frequency. Then we use the laws of thermodynamics to give a simple but\nunfamiliar derivation of Wien's displacement law[6]. This law is thus seen to hold not only\nfor electromagnetic radiation but also for any harmonic oscillator which is a thermodynamic\nsystem at temperature T . Next we discuss all the thermodynamic functions associated with\na harmonic oscillator thermodynamic system. We note that the high- and low-temperature\nlimits allowed by the Wien law correspond to zero-point energy and energy equipartition.\nThis simple observation is again not traditional in the physics literature. Finally, we suggest\na natural interpolation between the high- and low-temperature forms allowed by the Wien\ndisplacement law. The simple interpolation leads to the Planck spectrum with zero-point\nenergy.\nThe unconventional treatment presented here provides a compact approach to the blackbody problem through an elementary thermodynamic system which is simple enough for the\ntextbooks. The analysis emphasizes the intimate connections between blackbody radiation\nand zero-point radiation, and also fits neatly with the modern realization that constant acceleration of a harmonic oscillator through zero-point radiation makes the oscillator energy\nequal to the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation[7].\nII.\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR\n\nA harmonic oscillator corresponds to a nonrelativistic point mass m moving in one dimension in a potential V = (1/2)m\u03c9 2x2 . It can be described by the Lagrangian L(x, \u1e8b) =\n(1/2)m\u1e8b2 \u2212(1/2)m\u03c9 2x2 , and corresponds to harmonic oscillation x = (2U/m\u03c9)1/2 cos(\u03c9t+\u03c6)\nat energy U and angular frequency \u03c9. Under a slow change in the spring constant of the\nsystem corresponding to a change in the natural angular frequency \u03c9, the energy divided\nby the frequency U/\u03c9 is a constant[8] and so the change in system energy is dU = (U/\u03c9)d\u03c9\nand the work dW done by the system on the external agency changing the frequency is\ndW = \u2212(U/\u03c9)d\u03c9.\n\n(1)\n\nThus we regard X = \u2212U/\u03c9 as the generalized force associated with a change in frequency\n\u03c9.\nIf a harmonic oscillator is weakly coupled to a heat bath at temperature T , then it will\nexchange energy with the heat bath. In equilibrium with the bath, the harmonic oscillator at\n2\n\n\ffrequency \u03c9 will have an average energy U(\u03c9.T ). Thus the oscillator forms a thermodynamic\nsystem suitable for treatment by the usual methods of thermodynamics involving (average)\nenergy U, parameter \u03c9, and associated work dW = \u2212(U/\u03c9)d\u03c9.\nIII. DERIVATION OF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE CORRESPONDING TO\nWIEN'S DISPLACEMENT THEOREM\n\nWhen the oscillator is at thermal equilibrium in a bath at temperature T , the oscillator\nwill have an (average) energy U(\u03c9, T ) and an entropy S(\u03c9, T ) depending upon the temperature T and natural oscillation frequency \u03c9. Using the work expression in(1), the laws of\nthermodynamics for the oscillator give\ndQ = T dS(T, \u03c9) = dU(T, \u03c9) \u2212 (U/\u03c9)d\u03c9\nThis can be rewritten as\n\u0014\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202S\n\u2202S\n\u2202U\n\u2202U\nU\nT\ndT +\nd\u03c9 =\ndT +\nd\u03c9 \u2212 d\u03c9\n\u2202T \u03c9\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u2202T \u03c9\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u03c9\nSince the variables \u03c9 and T are independent, this requires\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202S\nU\n\u2202U\n\u2202S\n\u2202U\nT\n=\n,\nT\n=\n\u2212\n\u2202T \u03c9\n\u2202T \u03c9\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u2202\u03c9 T \u03c9\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nDifferentiating the first equation of (4) with respect to \u03c9 and the second with respect to T\ngives\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u22022S\n\u22022U\n\u22022U\n1 \u2202U\n\u2202S\n\u22022S\n+T\n(5)\n=\n,\n=\n\u2212\nT\n\u2202\u03c9\u2202T\n\u2202\u03c9\u2202T\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u2202T \u2202\u03c9\n\u2202T \u2202\u03c9 \u03c9 \u2202T \u03c9\nSubtracting the first equation of (5) from the second as as to eliminate the second-derivative\nterms, we have\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202S\n1 \u2202U\n=\u2212\n(6)\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u03c9 \u2202T \u03c9\nNext using (6) together with the first equation of (4), we find\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nT \u2202S\n\u2202S\n=\u2212\n(7)\n\u2202\u03c9 T\n\u03c9 \u2202T \u03c9\nwhich has the general solution\nS(\u03c9, T ) = g(\u03c9/T )\n(8)\nwhere g is an arbitrary function of the single variable \u03c9/T .

This corresponds to the information in the Wien displacement theorem.[3] Although the Wien theorem is often derived\nfrom the doppler shift of electromagnetic waves reflected from a moving piston in a cavity,\nour analysis shows that it holds in thermal equilibrium for any system described by a simple\nharmonic oscillator Lagrangian.\n3\n\n\fIV.\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC FUNCTIONS FOR A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR\n\nThe Wien displacement results S(\u03c9, T ) = g(\u03c9/T ) and U(\u03c9, T ) = \u03c9f (\u03c9/T ) give constraints upon all the thermodynamic functions for a harmonic oscillator. The thermodynamic potential[9] \u03c6(\u03c9/T ), from which all the other thermodynamics functions may be\nderived, must be a function of the combination \u03c9/T . The average oscillator energy U in\nthermal equilibrium follows as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202\u03c6\n2\nU(\u03c9, T ) = T\n= \u2212\u03c9\u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T )\n(11)\n\u2202T \u03c9\nThe entropy S of the oscillator is again a function of \u03c9/T ,\nS(\u03c9/T ) = \u03c6(\u03c9/T ) + U(\u03c9, T )/T = \u03c6(\u03c9/T ) \u2212 (\u03c9/T )\u03c6\u2032(\u03c9/T )\n\n(12)\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy F is directly related to the thermodynamic potential \u03c6(\u03c9/T )\nF (\u03c9, T ) = \u2212T \u03c6(\u03c9/T )\nThe generalized force X associated with a change in \u03c9 is\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202\u03c6\nX (\u03c9/T ) = T\n= \u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T )\n\u2202\u03c9 T\nand the specific heat C at constant \u03c9 is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u00112\n\u2202U\nC(\u03c9/T ) =\n=\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9/T )\n\u2202T \u03c9\nT\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nThus the equilibrium thermodynamics of a classical harmonic oscillator system is determined\nby one function, the unknown function \u03c6(\u03c9/T ).\nV.\n\nWIEN DISPLACEMENT RESULT AND ZERO-POINT ENERGY\n\nThere are two natural extremes for the oscillator energy given by the Wien displacement\nresult in (11); one extreme makes the energy U(\u03c9, T ) independent of temperature T , and\nthe other makes the energy U(\u03c9, T ) independent of the natural frequency \u03c9.\nWe deal first with the temperature-independent energy. When the potential function\n\u2032\n\u03c6 (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212const and so\n\u03c6(\u03c9/T ) = \u2212const \u00d7 (\u03c9/T )\n(16)\nthen the oscillator energy in (11) takes the form\nU(\u03c9, T ) = Uzp (\u03c9) = const \u00d7 \u03c9\n\n(17)\n\nThis corresponds to temperature-independent zero-point energy.\nWe note that substitution of the zero-point energy (17) into the first law of thermodynamics in the form\ndQ = dU \u2212 (U/\u03c9)d\u03c9 = d(const \u00d7 \u03c9) \u2212 (const \u00d7 \u03c9/\u03c9)d\u03c9 = 0\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\ftells us that no heat dQ enters the system on changing the natural frequency of the oscillator\n\u03c9. Thus changes in zero-point energy occur without any change in the thermodynamic\nentropy S(\u03c9/T ) of the system. Indeed, we see that if \u03c6\u2032zp is constant, then \u03c6zp (\u03c9/T ) =\nconst \u00d7 \u03c9/T must be linear in its argument, and the entropy S in Eq.(12) vanishes for any\nfunction \u03c6 which is linear in its argument.\nZero-point energy is random energy which is present even at zero temperature. Thermodynamics allows the possibility of zero-point energy and experimental evidence (such as\nthat for van der Waals forces) requires its existence.[10] It is natural to choose the unknown\nconstant for the zero-point energy in (17) so as to fit the experimentally measured van der\nWaals forces. This corresponds to an oscillator energy\nUzp (\u03c9) = (1/2)~\u03c9\n\n(19)\n\nwhere ~ is a constant which takes the value familiar for Planck's constant.\nVI.\n\nWIEN DISPLACEMENT RESULT AND ENERGY EQUIPARTITION\n\nThe other extreme for the Wien displacement result (11) is the case where the oscillator\nenergy depends upon the temperature but has no dependence upon the natural oscillator\nfrequency \u03c9. Thus when \u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212const/(\u03c9/T ) in equation (11), then the oscillator\nenergy is\nU(\u03c9, T ) = URJ (T ) = const \u00d7 T.\n(20)\nThis is the familiar energy equipartition law (proposed by Rayleigh and Jeans for lowfrequency radiation modes) where the constant is chosen as Boltzmann's constant kB ,\nURJ (T ) = kB T.\n\n(21)\n\nIn this case, an isothermal change of the natural oscillator frequency \u03c9 produces no change\nin the oscillator internal energy. Rather, from (2), the isothermal work done on changing\nthe natural frequency \u03c9 is provided by heat added which keeps the internal oscillator energy\nconstant,\ndQ = T dS(\u03c9/T ) = dURJ (T ) \u2212 (U/\u03c9)d\u03c9, constant T\n(22)\nThen\ndSRJ = 0 \u2212 (kB /\u03c9)d\u03c9,\n\nconstant T,\n\n(23)\n\nand since we know the functional form S(\u03c9/T ), we have the familiar result\nSRJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212kB ln(\u03c9/T ) + const\n\n(24)\n\nIndeed if \u03c6\u2032RJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212kB /(\u03c9/T ), then \u03c6RJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212kB ln(\u03c9/T ) and the entropy in (12)\ntakes the form (24).\nVII.\n\nUSE OF NATURAL UNITS IN THE ANALYSIS\n\nIn this paper we are not interested in the numerical evaluation of thermodynamic quantities but rather in the fundamental thermodynamic behavior. On this account we will\nmeasure all quantities in terms of energy and take the entropy as a pure number. Thus we\n5\n\n\fwill take ~ = 1 and measure frequencies in energy units. Also, we will take kB = 1 and measure temperature in energy units.[11] Thus the limiting form corresponding to zero-point\nenergy has\n\u03c6zp (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212(1/2)(\u03c9/T ),\nUzp (\u03c9) = (1/2)\u03c9\n(25)\nwhile the limiting form corresponding to energy equipartition becomes\n\u03c6RJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212 ln(\u03c9/T ),\n\nVIII.\n\nURJ (T ) = T\n\n(26)\n\nASYMPTOTIC LIMITS FOR THERMAL OSCILLATOR ENERGY\n\nIn general, the behavior of an oscillator system will depend upon both frequency \u03c9 and\ntemperature T as in (11). In the limit as T \u2192 0, we expect to recover the zero-point energy\nof the oscillator\nlimT \u21920 U(\u03c9, T ) = limT \u21920 [\u2212\u03c9\u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T )] = Uzp (\u03c9) = (1/2)\u03c9\n\n(27)\n\nand the associated thermodynamic potential\n\u03c6(\u03c9/T ) \u2192 \u03c6zp (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212(1/2)(\u03c9/T )\n\n(28)\n\nIn the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0, we expect to obtain the equipartition energy\nlim\u03c9\u21920 U(\u03c9, T ) = lim\u03c9\u21920 [\u2212\u03c9\u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T )] = URJ (T ) = T\n\n(29)\n\nand the associated thermodynamic potential\n\u03c6(\u03c9/T ) \u2192 \u03c6RJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212 ln(\u03c9/T )\n\n(30)\n\nIt is sometimes useful to make a distinction between the THERMAL energy UT (\u03c9, T ) of\nan oscillator and the oscillator's TOTAL energy U(\u03c9, T ). The thermal energy is just the\n(average) energy above the (average) zero-point energy\nUT (\u03c9, T ) = U(\u03c9, T ) \u2212 Uzp (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c9\u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T ) \u2212 (1/2)\u03c9 = \u2212\u03c9[\u03c6\u2032 (\u03c9/T ) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032zp (\u03c9/T )]\n\n(31)\n\nAlthough the total oscillator energy U(\u03c9, T ) is related to forces, it is only the thermal\noscillator energy UT (\u03c9, T ) which is related to changes in thermodynamic entropy since (as\nseen above) \u03c6zp (\u03c9/T ) does not give any thermodynamic entropy.\nIX. PLANCK SPECTRUM AS THE SMOOTHEST INTERPOLATION BETWEEN THE EQUIPARTITION AND ZERO-POINT LIMITS\n\nAlthough the thermodynamic forms given in Eqs.(11)-(15) represent the information obtained from thermodynamic analysis, it is tempting to try to guess the full thermodynamic\nbehavior which is chosen by nature. Now experiments indicate that nature indeed chooses\nthe asymptotic forms given in Eqs.(27)-(30) corresponding to non-zero values of ~ and kB.\nThus we ask whether there is any natural choice for behavior which connects these asymptotic forms. One expects thermodynamics to involve smooth functions, and hence one might\nseek the \"smoothest possible\" interpolation between the extremes.\n6\n\n\fIs the idea of a \"smoothest possible\" interpolation well-defined? In general, this seems\nambiguous. However, there are cases where the \"smoothest possible\" function appears\nabsolutely clear. Thus if for small values of x an analytic function has the form f (x) =\na \u2212 bx + O(x2 ) with a > 0, b > 0, and for large values of x the function f (x) \u2192 0, then the\nsmoothest possible interpolation between the limits is f (x) = a exp(\u2212bx/a). This function\nmeets the asymptotic limits and is a monotonic function whose nth derivative is just (\u2212b/a)n\ntimes the value of the function at that point. Thus every point x involves the same local\nfunctional behavior for f (x). Every point is equivalent. It is only modification of this\nfunctional form which introduces preferred values for x.\nLet us reconsider the asymptotic forms given in Eqs.(27)-(30). The energy forms are not\nuseful since these do not give us asymptotic functions of \u03c9/T . The limiting thermodynamic\npotentials\n\u03c6RJ (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212 ln(\u03c9/T ),\n\u03c6zp (\u03c9/T ) = \u2212(1/2)\u03c9/T\n(32)\ninvolve logarithmic behavior at the low-frequency limit. Since the logarithmic function is\nmore complicated analytically than the exponential function, it is convenient to take the\nexponential of the negative of these functions and to consider\nexp[\u2212\u03c6RJ (\u03c9/T )] = \u03c9/T,\n\nexp[\u2212\u03c6zp (\u03c9/T )] = exp[\u03c9/(2T )]\n\n(33)\n\nThe exponentiation will not change the \"smoothest possible\" criterion required of the interpolation. Thus according to (33) we are searching for the \"smoothest possible\" interpolation\nexp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] between linear behavior \u03c9/T at small argument and exponential behavior\nexp[\u03c9/(2T )] at large argument\nexp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] \u2192 \u03c9/T for \u03c9/T \u2192 0, and exp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] \u2192 exp[\u03c9/(2T )] for \u03c9/T \u2192 \u221e\n(34)\nWe notice that the difference of the high-frequency limit and the desired interpolation has\nthe asymptotic forms\nexp[\u03c9/(2T )] \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] \u2192 1 + \u03c9/(2T ) \u2212 \u03c9/T = 1 \u2212 \u03c9/(2T ) for \u03c9/T \u2192 0\nexp[\u03c9/(2T )] \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] \u2192 0 for \u03c9/T \u2192 \u221e\n\n(35)\n\nBut this corresponds to exactly the case mentioned in the previous paragraph. Thus the\n\"smoothest possible\" interpolation is\nexp[\u03c9/(2T )] \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] = exp[\u2212\u03c9/(2T )]\n\n(36)\n\nexp[\u2212\u03c6(\u03c9/T )] = exp[\u03c9/(2T )] \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c9/(2T )] = 2 sinh[\u03c9/(2T )]\n\n(37)\n\nThis implies\n\nIt is easy to see that the right-hand side of (37) has exactly the asymptotic forms demanded in (33). Then taking the logarithm of (37) and using the thermodynamic relations\ngiven in (11) and (12), this smooth interpolation leads to the thermodynamic functions\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0010\u03c9 \u0011\n1\u03c9\n\u03c6P zp\n= \u2212 ln 2 sinh\n(38)\nT\n2T\n7\n\n\f\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c9\n1\n1\u03c9\n1\n=\n+ \u03c9\nUP zp (\u03c9, T ) = \u03c9 coth\n2\n2T\nexp(\u03c9/T ) \u2212 1 2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\u03c9\u0011\n1\u03c9\n1\u03c9\n1\u03c9\nSP\n= \u2212 ln 2 sinh\n+\ncoth\nT\n2T\n2T\n2T\n\n(39)\n(40)\n\nWe have labeled these thermodynamic functions with the subscript \"Pzp\" or \"P\" because\nthey correspond exactly to the familiar Planck average oscillator energy including zero-point\nenergy. As noted above, the entropy depends upon the Planck thermal spectrum UT (\u03c9, T )\nbut does not reflect the zero-point energy included in U(\u03c9, T ).\nX.\n\nCOMMENTS ON THE INTERPOLATION FOR PLANCK'S SPECTRUM\n\nThe analysis above shows that demanding the smoothest interpolation between the\nequipartition and zero-point limits suggests the Planck spectrum. This seems a surprisingly\nsimple extrapolation from the thermodynamic analysis. One may wonder why such an extrapolation was not made a century ago. Indeed, many physicists are aware that Planck\ndid arrive at the blackbody spectrum as an interpolation. However, Planck's interpolation\ndid not come from the limits on the Wien displacement theorem. Rather, his interpolation\ninvolved a modification which combined earlier guesses at the high- and low-frequency parts\nof the thermal energy spectrum UT (\u03c9, T ).[12]\nThe simple interpolation made here was not made a century ago because physicists did\nnot think in terms of a temperature-independent zero-point radiation. Indeed, even today,\ntextbook discussions of blackbody radiation do not usually make any reference to zeropoint radiation.[13] It is only much more recently, and in particular in connection with\nexperimental measurements of Casimir forces, that physicists have taken seriously the zeropoint energy suggested by the high-frequency limit of the Wien displacement law.\nIndeed the smooth extrapolation analysis for a harmonic oscillator given here fits neatly\nwith the thermal effects of acceleration suggested by Davies and Unruh[7]. If one considers a\ncharged harmonic oscillator undergoing constant acceleration through zero-point radiation,\nthen the oscillator comes into equilibrium with the random radiation. When the oscillator\nhas zero acceleration, its average energy U(\u03c9, a = 0) depends only upon its frequency and is\njust zero-point energy U(\u03c9, a = 0) = (1/2) ~\u03c9. When the oscillator has a large acceleration\na, then the average oscillator energy depends only upon its acceleration a and is independent\nof its natural frequency \u03c9. Thus zero\u2013point energy and energy equipartition form the natural\nextremes. And the function which connects these extremes is found to be exactly the Planck\nspectrum (39) with a temperature T = ~a/2\u03c0ckB .[7]\nXI.\n\nCONCLUDING SUMMARY\n\nThe harmonic oscillator provides a simple thermodynamics system involving energy U,\ntemperature T , and oscillator frequency \u03c9. If one carries out a quasi-static change in\nthe oscillator frequency \u03c9, then thermodynamic analysis leads to results which correspond\nto the Wien displacement law. All of the thermodynamic behavior for the oscillator can\nbe derived from a single thermodynamic potential function \u03c6(\u03c9/T ) depending upon the\nsingle variable \u03c9/T . If we consider the limits which make the oscillator energy U(\u03c9, T )\n8\n\n\findependent of one of its variables, then we find the extremes corresponding to zero-point\nenergy and energy equipartition. Finally, as a guess for nature's choice of thermodynamic\nbehavior, we ask for the function satisfying the Wien displacement law which provides the\nsmoothest interpolation between the extremes of zero-point energy and energy equipartition.\nThis leads to the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation.\n\n[1] See, for example, M.
