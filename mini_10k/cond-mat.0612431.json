Vanadium oxides, manganites, frustrated quantum magnetic insulators, high-Tc\nand organic superconductors are examples of such systems where complex orders and quantum criticality can\nbe found. More specifically, the coexistence and/or competition of magnetism and superconductivity near the\nMott transition in high-Tc and organic materials constitute fundamental issues that are widely addressed in the\nliterature (ex. [2]). In this respect the layered quasi-twodimensional \u03ba-[BEDT-TTF]2 X compounds are of great\ninterest. Their generic temperature vs pressure phase diagram [3, 4, 5, 6] reveals that the superconducting (SC)\nand the antiferromagnetic insulating phases (AF) are separated by a first order Mott transition line (MI), where\na microscale phase separation takes place [7]. The first\norder line persists in the paramagnetic phase and terminates with a critical point, from which a pseudogap line\nemerges under pressure as a precursor of the superconducting state. \u03ba-[BEDT-TTF]2 X compounds can thus\nbe considered as prototype systems to study the interplay between magnetic and superconducting phases in\nthe close proximity of a first order MI transition\nIn this work the ultrasonic technique and thermal cycling are used to present a detailed study of the different phases appearing in the vicinity of the Mott transition line in the \u03ba-[BEDT-TTF]2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br compound (noted \u03ba-H8 -Br hereafter). At ambient pressure,\n\u03ba-H8 -Br is located on the metallic side of the MI line\nand a slight shift on the pressure scale can be achieved\nby a fine thermal tuning of residual intrinsic disorder related to ordering of ethylene end groups of BEDT-TTF\nmolecules occurring between 200 and 60 K [8]. Although\na larger shift could be obtained by partial alloying with\nthe Cu[N(CN)2 ]Cl anion and/or from deuteration of the\nBEDT-TTF molecules, these procedures introduce, however, extrinsic disorder that must be avoided. Here, we\nreport sound velocity and the first ultrasonic attenuation\n\nmeasurements to be realized on these layered compounds.\nThe results clearly establish a wide domain of the P-T\nphase diagram where magnetic and superconducting ordered phases overlap. A fine tuning of ethylene disorder through thermal cycles is found to move the system\non the pressure scale. The MI is thus reached from the\nmetallic side where the emergence of an ordered magnetic phase is found, which is detrimental to superconductivity. The magnetic phase that set in around 15 K\nin \u03ba-H8 -Br scales with the amplitude of the pseudogap\nanomaly above 30 K or so[5]. As for the superconducting transition occurring at 11.9 K, fluctuation effects are\nfound few degrees above the critical temperature.\n\nFIG. 1: Relative variation of the longitudinal L[010]velocity\nat 160 MHz as a function of temperature for different thermal\ncycles. Inset: zoom around the 12 K anomaly; the curves\nhave been shifted for a better view. The arrows indicate the\nmaximum slope which determines Tc .\n\nAlthough difficult to adapt to thin organic crystals,\npulsed ultrasonic velocity experiments have already been\ncarried out on few compounds of this family [5, 9, 10]. It\n\n\f2\nconsists in measuring the phase shift and the amplitude\nof the first elastic pulse transmitted through the crystal\nand a delay line [10]; this is why the technique yields\nonly velocity and attenuation variations. Because of the\nplatelet shape of the selected \u03ba-H8 -Br crystals, only elastic waves propagating perpendicularly to the plane (direction (010)) could be generated with small piezoelectric transducers. Longitudinal waves polarized along the\nb axis L[010] and, for the first time, transverse waves polarized along the a axis T[100] could be generated over\nthe 30-450 MHz frequency range. The crystals were submitted to the following thermal cycles from 200 K to 2\nK: the standard slow cool (SL) process, 10 K/hour, and\na fast cool (FT) process during 10 minutes; following a\nFT process, a 24 hour annealing at 85 K (A-85K) or 70\nK (A-70K). According to the literature [8, 11, 12], maximum order of the ethylene end groups is obtained when\nannealing is performed at a temperature between 60 and\n80 K for a period of 24 hours. All the ultrasonic data\npresented in this paper were obtained when sweeping the\ntemperature up from 2 K. A magnetic field up to 16 Tesla\ncould be applied perpendicularly to the plane in order to\ncompletely eliminate the superconducting state.\nWe report in Figure 1 the temperature profile of the\nrelative velocity variation ( \u2206v\nv ) of the L[010] mode at 160\nMHz over the 2-80K range for different thermal cycles.\nNo frequency dependence is observed over the 30-450\nMHz range; only the signal to noise ratio increases with\nfrequency. The profiles reveal two distinct anomalies: i) a\nhuge dip (3-6%) just above 30 K previously associated to\na compressibility increase driven by the magnetic fluctuations of the electronic degrees of freedom at the pseudogap [5]; ii) a much smaller anomaly around 12 K likely related to the onset of superconductivity. Both the amplitude and the position of the compressibility anomaly are\nhighly dependent on the amount of disorder: FT (maximum disorder) yields the maximum amplitude (6%) at\nthe lowest temperature (33 K), whereas SL followed by\nannealing at 70 K (minimum disorder) reduces by half\nthe anomaly and shifts it to higher temperature (39 K).\nOther cooling rates give intermediate disorder and in turn\nintermediate results. The process of ordering the ethylene end groups thus mimics an actual increase of the effective pressure [10]. The effect of disorder on the small\n12 K anomaly is shown in the inset of Figure 1. Fast\ncooling (maximum disorder) produces a mere change of\nslope just above 11 K while a small dip grows progressively with increasing order together with a small shift to\nhigher temperatures. This dip signals the onset of the superconducting state in agreement with what is expected\nfor a longitudinal mode [13]. However, the increase of\nTc with internal pressure (see inset of Fig.1), confirmed\nby SQUID magnetization measurements, is not consistent with hydrostatic pressure studies. This might be\nexplained by small residual disorder to which non s-wave\nsuperconductivity is particularly sensitive. An important hysteresis is also observed on the velocity data (also\ntrue for the attenuation presented later) when the tem-\n\nperature is swept up and down between 2K and 20 K,\nwhich is consistent with the proximity of the first order\nMI transition.\nAs superconductivity is easily quenched by a field per\u22a5\npendicular to the highly conducting planes (Hc2\n\u223c 12\nTesla), a magnetic field investigation of the low temperature anomaly appears appropriate to identify the\ndifferent phases. The longitudinal L[010] mode and a\ntransverse mode, T[100], which appears to couple more\nstrongly to the superconducting state, are used for this\ninvestigation. We compare in Figure 2(a) the \u2206v\nv (T ) data\nat 0 and 16 Tesla for the FT process (maximum disorder). In zero field, the velocity of the L[010] mode shows\n\nFIG. 2: Relative variation of sound velocity as a function\nof temperature at fixed magnetic field values: L[010] mode at\n100 MHz and T[100] mode at 160 MHz. (a) FT process (maximum disorder) and (b)A-70K process (maximum order).\n\na plateau around 15 K before increasing further below\n11 K, where a marked softening of the mode is produced\nby the magnetic field. For the T[100] mode, the velocity shows a similar plateau around 15 K, followed by an\nimportant dip centered at 11.5 K. The dip disappears in\na 16 Tesla field but the plateau is maintained. We thus\nconclude that the 11.5 K dip and the 15 K plateau signal respectively superconductivity and another ordered\nphase. This is confirmed by the 6 Tesla curve of Figure\n2(a), which shows the shift of the 11.5 K anomaly to 5 K,\nwhereas the plateau at 15 K is kept unchanged. When\nmaximum order (A-70K process) is achieved, the temperature profile of the anomaly is greatly modified (Fig.\n2(b)). When the temperature decreases from 20 K in zero\nmagnetic field, a maximum is observed around 13.5 K followed by a sharp drop till a minimum is achieved at 11.5\nK; at lower temperatures the velocity increases smoothly.\nThe amplitude and temperature profile of the anomaly\nare however different for both acoustic modes, being more\npronounced for the T[100] one. A 16 Tesla field completely suppresses the anomaly: the velocity increases\nsmoothly with decreasing temperature and, in contrast\nto the FT process, no plateau is observed at 15 K; only\na weak variation of slope occurs around 8 K. Minimizing\n\n\f3\ndisorder then favors the superconducting phase as signaled by the sharp drop centered at 11.9 K consistent\nwith the \u2206v/v data (inset Fig.1). We cannot, however,\ndiscard contributions of other phases, which can produce\nsmall slope variations. The presence and nature of theses\nphases are most easily revealed by the attenuation measurements whose sensitivity increases with frequency. We\nreport now the first ultrasonic attenuation measurements\nrealized on this family of layered conductors for the A70K process, which favors superconductivity.\nWe present in Figure 3 the variations of the attenuation \u2206\u03b1(T ) obtained simultaneously with the \u2206v\nv (T )\ndata. The zeroth value is arbitrarily chosen by extrapolating the zero field curve at 0 K. For both ultrasonic\n\nFIG. 3: Variation of the sound attenuation as a function of\ntemperature for the A-70K process (maximum order) at fixed\nmagnetic field values: L[010] mode at 160 MHz and T[100]\nat 100 MHz. See text for the description of the ENS curve.\nInset: \u2206\u03b1 as a function of H 2 at 13 K and 18 K for the L[010]\nmode at 160MHz.\n\nmodes over the 2-20 K temperature range, \u2206\u03b1(T ) is an\nincreasing function of temperature due to a large attenuation peak accompanying the huge velocity dip near 40 K\n(Fig.1)[5]. In zero field, the rate of increasing attenuation\nis reduced at the superconducting temperature around 12\nK; this trend is more pronounced for the T[100] mode,\nwhere it almost appears as a discontinuity in the slope. In\na 16 Tesla field, a substantial increase of \u2206\u03b1 is produced\nbelow Tc when superconductivity is quenched, while a\nweak decrease is observed above. These effects are again\nmore pronounced for the T[100] mode. Surprisingly, a\nchange of slope persists below 15 K which implies the\ncoexistence of a secondary phase with superconductivity\neven when disorder is minimized. To get an insight into\nthis phase and to isolate the superconducting contribution to the attenuation, we now examine precisely the\nfield dependence of the attenuation.\nThe \u2206\u03b1(T ) data vary quadratically with field (inset\n\u22a5\n.\nof Figure 3) over the 2-20 K range as long as H > Hc2\nSuch a H 2 dependence, which is also observed for the\nvelocity data, proceeds from the first correction term to\ntransport and magnetic properties to which ultrasonic\nwaves couple [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. If we write \u2206\u03b1(T )\n\nin zero field as a sum of two contributions, one due\nto the superconducting state (SC) and another one to\nan exotic normal state (ENS), \u2206\u03b1(T ) = \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) +\n\u2206\u03b1EN S (T ), we can isolate the SC contribution by modeling the field effects on the ENS phase in the following\nway: \u2206\u03b1EN S (T, H) = \u2206\u03b1EN S (T, 0) + \u03b3\u03b1 (T )H 2 . Thus,\nplots of \u2206\u03b1 as a function of H 2 at fixed temperatures\nyield \u03b3\u03b1 (T ) as the slope and \u2206\u03b1EN S (T, 0) as the extrapolated value toward the zero field limit. The contribution of the SC phase \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) is thus obtained after\nsubstracting the ENS contribution.\nWhen compared with zero field data (Figure 3), the\n\u2206\u03b1EN S (T, 0) curves do not appear monotonous. When\nthe temperature is decreased from 20 K, the ENS curves\nfor both modes coincide with the zero field one but they\ndepart abruptly from each other around 15 K. For T\n< 15 K, apart from the 12-15 K temperature range for\nthe T[100] mode, the ENS attenuation is higher than\nin zero field, in agreement with larger sound attenuation in the normal state compared to the superconducting one. Anomalous behaviors at 15 K can also be seen\nin the \u03b3\u03b1 (T ) and \u03b3v (T ) coefficients. Examples of such\ncoefficients for the L[010] mode are presented in the inset of Figure 4 at a frequency of 428 MHz, which yields\nmaximum sensitivity. Below 20 K, the \u03b3\u03b1 (T ) coefficient\nincreases with decreasing temperature until an abrupt\ndownward transition occurs at 15 K; \u03b3v (T ) is rather constant below 20 K, but it increases steeply at 15 K with a\nquasi-linear variation at lower temperatures. These features of the ENS phase mimic the onset of an antiferromagnetic order parameter at 15 K that is 3 K above the\nsuperconducting transition. This is consistent with studies where deuteration of the BEDT-TTF molecules shifts\nthe compound on the pressure scale at the boundary of\nthe phase diagram where superconductivity is replaced\nby an antiferromagnetic insulating phase at 15 K [19]. We\nsuggest that the 15 K anomalies observed in our velocity\nand attenuation data are the result of a magneto-elastic\ncoupling with an ordered AF phase. The temperature at\nwhich this phase occurs is TAF = 15 K, and appears to\nbe very weakly field dependent (Fig. 2a) up to 16 Tesla.\nThis observation is consistent with the symmetry of the\nAF phase deduced for the \u03ba-D8 -Br compound [20].\nFinally, the contribution of the superconducting state\nto the attenuation \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) is presented in Figure 4. For\nboth modes, \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) is negative as expected for a superconducting state. However, the temperature profile\nbelow Tc does not appear to be consistent with a conventional s-wave order parameter for which a monotonous\ndecrease of attenuation is well known to be expected. For\nthe L[010] mode, the decrease of the attenuation at 15\nK suggests the existence of superconducting fluctuations\nwhereas the shoulder at 11.9 K coincides with the onset of phase coherence. Then \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) goes through a\nminimum around 8 K before increasing further down to\n2 K, while remaining always negative. For the transverse\nmode T[100], although superconducting fluctuations are\nalso effective below 15 K, they rather produce an en-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: \u2206\u03b1SC as a function of temperature: L[010] mode at\n160 MHz and T[100] at 100 MHz.

At lower temperatures \u2206\u03b1SC (T ) decreases\nfurther and flattens below 7 K. These features around 79 K cannot be reconciled with any theoretical model for\nthe moment, although we must keep in mind the peculiar topology of the Fermi surface, which consists of two\nparts, namely the quasi-one-dimensional electron sheets\nand two-dimensional hole pockets. We remind that the\nultrasonic L[010] mode probes the complete 2D Fermi\nsurface while the transverse T[100] one is mainly sensitive\nto the 1D electron sheets. Finally, there may be a connection between these low temperature features around\n8 K with a secondary dissipation phase observed in the\npressure transport measurements[3, 21].\n\n[1] F. Kagawa, K.

The farther the system is from the\nfirst order boundary, the stronger is the superconducting\nphase relative to the magnetic one. This can be realized by applying hydrostatic pressure or, as demonstrated\nin our paper, by controlling the amount of disorder of\nthe ethylene end groups. This competition is summarized in Figure 4: when magnetic fluctuations probably\nconnected to an ordered AF phase disappear around 15\nK, superconducting fluctuations grow rapidly to yield a\ntransition at 11.9 K. It is clearly demonstrated that disorder favors the magnetic fluctuations (huge dip at 33 K)\nwhich is detrimental to the superconducting state. However, this competition apparently yields a phase separation over all the sample's volume as it was suggested from\ninfrared reflectivity data at high temperatures [22] and\nconfirmed by the hysteresis observed on our velocity and\nattenuation data in the 2-20 K range. Finally, although\nthe attenuation data does not appear consistent with a\ns-wave order parameter, a thorough frequency and polarization analysis of the ultrasonic attenuation together\nwith precise theoretical predictions [23] will be needed\nto establish the symmetry of the superconducting order\nparameter.\nThe authors thank C.
