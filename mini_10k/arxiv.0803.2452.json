Graphene is naturally of\ninterest from the viewpoint of relativistic quantum field\ntheory, and is a special laboratory to test the particlehole picture9 of the quantum vacuum and, especially in\na magnetic field, to study peculiar quantum phenomena10,11,12,13,14 tied to the chiral and parity anomalies.\nActually, the half-integer quantum Hall (QH) effect and\nthe presence of the zero-energy Landau levels observed1,2\nin graphene are a manifestation of spectral asymmetry\nimplied by the anomaly.\nThe bilayer (and multilayer) of graphene is as interesting and exotic15,16 as the monolayer. In bilayer\ngraphene interlayer coupling modifies the intralayer relativistic spectra to yield a quasiparticle spectrum with\na parabolic energy dispersion.15 The relativistic feature\nthereby disappears but the particle-hole structure still\nremains, leading to a \"chiral\" Schroedinger Hamiltonian, which has no analog in particle physics. Bilayer\ngraphene, like monolayers, is intrinsically a gapless semiconductor but has a notable property that the energy\ngap between the conduction and valence bands is controllable17,18,19,20,21 by use of external gates or chemical\ndoping.\nTheoretical studies show that electronic transport4,5,6\nand screening22 in graphene are substantially different\nfrom those in standard planar systems. The difference\nbecomes even more prominent under a magnetic field:23\nFor graphene the vacuum state is a dielectric medium\nwith appreciable electric and magnetic susceptibilities\nover all range of wavelengths. Curiously the zero-energy\nLandau levels, though carrying normal Hall conductance\ne2 /h per level, scarcely contribute to the dielectric effect.\nThe purpose of this paper is to study the electromag-\n\nnetic response of bilayer graphene in a magnetic field at\ninteger filling factor \u03bd, in comparison with that of monolayer graphene. It turns out that both types of graphene\nare qualitatively quite similar in dielectric and screening\ncharacteristics, but the effect is much more sizable for\nbilayers (because of the difference in the basic cyclotron\nenergy).\nIn bilayer graphene there arise two species of zeroenergy levels (or zero modes), which, when an interlayer\nfield is applied, move up or down (oppositely) at the\ntwo valleys. Remarkably, the dielectric effects due to\nthe (pseudo) zero modes, unlike in monolayers, become\nvisible and even grow steadily as the tunable band gap\ndevelops. It is pointed out that the splitting of nearly degenerate pseudo-zero-mode levels at each valley, specific\nto bilayer graphene, is controlled by an inplane electric\nfield or by an injected current. In addition, we construct\nout of the response a low-energy effective gauge theory\nof bilayer graphene in a magnetic field and verify that\nthe electric susceptibility of a QH system is generally expressed as a ratio of the Hall conductance to the Landau\ngap.\nIn Sec. II we briefly review the low-energy effective\ntheory of bilayer graphene and study its Landau-level\nspectrum. In Sec. III we examine the electromagnetic response and screening properties of bilayer graphene. In\nSec. IV we derive an effective gauge theory. In Sec. V\nwe study the effect of an inplane field on the almost degenerate zero-mode levels at each valley and discuss its\nconsequences. Section VI is devoted to a summary and\ndiscussion.\n\nII.\n\nBILAYER GRAPHENE\n\nThe bilayer graphene consists of two coupled hexagonal lattices of carbon atoms, arranged in Bernal A\u2032 B\nstacking, with inequivalent sites denoted as (A, B) in the\nbottom layer and (A\u2032 , B \u2032 ) in the top layer. The elec-\n\n\f2\ntron fields in the bilayer are described by four-component\nspinors on the four sites and, as in the case of monolayer\ngraphene, their low-energy spectrum is governed by the\nelectron states near the two inequivalent Fermi points K\nand K \u2032 in the Brillouin zone. The intralayer coupling\n\u03b30 \u2261 \u03b3AB \u2248 2.9 eV is related\n\u221a to the Fermi velocity in\nmonolayer graphene, v0 = ( 3/2) aL \u03b30 /h\u0304 \u2248 106 m/s,\nwith the lattice constant aL = 0.246nm. The interlayer\ncoupling \u03b31 \u2261 \u03b3A\u2032 B and \u03b33 \u2261 \u03b3AB \u2032 are one-order of magnitude weaker than the intralayer coupling \u03b30 ; numerically,24 \u03b31 \u2248 0.30 eV and \u03b33 \u2248 0.10 eV.\nActually the neighboring sites A\u2032 and B form interlayer\ndimers via \u03b31 and get shifted to higher energy bands,\nand the low-energy sector is essentially described by twocomponent spinors residing on the A and B \u2032 sites. The\neffective Hamiltonian is written as15\nZ\nh\ni\nH = d2 x \u03c8 \u2020 (H+ \u2212 eA0 )\u03c8 + \u03c7\u2020 (H\u2212 \u2212 eA0 )\u03c7 ,\nH\u03be = H0 + Has ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03a0\n(\u03a0\u2020 )2\n\u2212\nH0 = \u03bev3\n,\n\u03a0\u2020\n2m\u2217 \u03a02\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0012 \u2020\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03beU\n1\n1\n\u03a0 \u03a0\nHas =\n\u2212\n, (2.1)\n\u22121\n\u2212\u03a0\u03a0\u2020\n2\n\u03b31 m \u2217\n\nwhere coupling to electromagnetic potentials (Ai , A0 ) is\nintroduced through \u03a0 = \u03a0x \u2212 i\u03a0y , \u03a0\u2020 = \u03a0x + i\u03a0y , and\n\u03a0i = \u2212i\u2202i + eAi . Here \u03be = 1 refers to the K valley with\nH+ = H\u03be=1 and \u03c8 = (\u03c8A , \u03c8B \u2032 )t while \u03be = \u22121 refers to\nthe K \u2032 valley with H\u2212 = H\u03be=\u22121 and \u03c7 = (\u03c7B \u2032 , \u03c7A )t . We\nsuppress the electron spin, which is taken care of simply\nvia spin degeneracy gs = 2.\nIn H0 the first term with a linear dispersion represents\ndirect interlayer\nhopping via \u03b33 , with characteristic veloc\u221a\nity v3 = ( 3/2) aL \u03b33 /h\u0304 \u223c v0 /30, while the second term\nwith a quadratic dispersion represents A \u2194 B \u2032 hopping\nvia the dimer state, giving h\u03042 /(2m\u2217 ) = v02 /\u03b31 .\nThe Has takes into account a possible asymmetry between the two layers, leading to a gap U between the\nconduction and valence bands. An important feature of\nbilayer graphene is that such a gap is controllable17,18,19\nby use of external gates, U \u2248 e\u25b3A0 with an interlayer\nbottom\nvoltage \u25b3A0 = Atop\n. The second term in Has\n0 \u2212 A0\nis a layer asymmetry associated with the depleted charge\non the AB \u2032 dimer sites; we call it a kinetic asymmetry.\nLet us place graphene in a strong uniform magnetic\nfield B > 0 normal to the sample plane; to this end we set\nAi (x) \u2192 AB\u221a= B (\u2212y, 0). It is convenient\nto rescale \u03a0 =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2eB a = ( 2/l) a\u221aand \u03a0 = ( 2/l) a with the magnetic length l = 1/ eB so that [a, a\u2020 ] =\u221a1. The kinetic\nterms thereby acquire the scale v3 \u2192 v3 2/l \u2261 \u03c93 and\n1/(2m\u2217 ) \u2192 eB/m\u2217 \u2261\np\u03c9c ; numerically, \u03c9c \u2248 3.9 \u00d7 B[T]\nmeV and \u03c93 \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 B[T] meV, where B[T] stands for\nthe magnetic field in\u221aTesla. Thepassociated Landau-level\nspectra scale like \u03c93 n and \u03c9c n(n \u2212 1) with p\nthe level\n\u221a\nindex n = 0, 1, * * *, with ratio \u223c 0.3/( n \u2212 1 B[T]).\nTherefore the \u03c93 term is practically negligible, compared\n\nwith the \u03c9c term, for higher Landau levels n \u2265 2 under\na strong magnetic field. With this in mind we cast the\nHamiltonian H\u03be in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc (1 \u2212 z a\u2020 a) \u03bb a \u2212 (a\u2020 )2\nH\u03be = \u03c9c\n, (2.2)\n\u03bb a\u2020 \u2212 a2\n\u2212\u03bc (1 \u2212 z aa\u2020 )\np\nwith \u03bb = \u03be \u03c93 /\u03c9c \u2248 \u00b10.3/ B[T]. Here \u03bc = \u03beU/(2\u03c9c )\nstands for half of the band gap in units of \u03c9c , and it\nseems feasible18 to achieve an interlayer-voltage change of\nmagnitude \u03bc \u223c O(1). Note that the kinetic asymmtry \u223c\n\u03bc z a\u2020 a is very weak, with z = 2\u03c9c /\u03b31 \u2248 0.026 \u00d7 B[T] \u226a\n1.\nLet us for the moment set a tiny parameter z \u2192 0. It\nis, then, generally seen from the structure of H\u03be that its\neigenmodes are the same as those of H\u03be |\u03bc\u21920 and that the\nspectrum of H\u03be is symmetric about \u01eb = 0, except for a\npossible \u01eb = \u03c9c \u03bc spectrum or the zero-energy spectrum\nof H\u03be |\u03bc\u21920 . We shall call the \u01eb = \u00b1\u03c9c |\u03bc| eigenmodes of\nH\u03be pseudo-zero-modes, or simply \"zero\" modes.\nSuch spectra are slightly modulated by the tiny O(\u03bcz)\nkinetic asymmetry. For \u03bb = 0 it is possible to write down\nthe eigenmodes explicitly. The \"nonzero\" modes of H\u03be\nare Landau levels of energy\n\u01eb n = sn \u03c9 c\n\np\n1\n|n|(|n| \u2212 1) + \u03bc\u03022n \u2212 \u03c9c \u03bc z\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nlabeled by integers n = \u00b12, \u00b13, . . ., and px (or y0 \u2261\nl2 px ); \u03bc\u0302n = \u03bc{1 \u2212 (|n| \u2212 21 ) z}. Here sn \u2261 sgn{n} =\n\u00b11 specifies the sign of the energy \u01ebn .

Actually the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit corresponds to the case of monolayer graphene with linear\ndispersion. The index thus jumps from \"2\" to \"-1\" as\none passes from finite \u03bb to infinite \u03bb.\nThe linear kinetic term affects the spectrum \u01ebn of the\n|n| \u2265 2 levels only to O(\u03bb2 ), which is still negligible in\na strong magnetic field. We shall therefore set \u03bb \u2192 0 in\nmost of our analysis below, except in Sec. V where we\ndiscuss possible resolution of the zero-mode levels.\nFor actual calculations it is useful to make the Landau25,26\nlevel\n\u03c8(x, t) =\nP structure explicit via the expansion\nn,y0 hx|n, y0 i \u03c8n (y0 , t). (From now on, we shall only\ndisplay the \u03c8 sector since the \u03c7 sector is obtained by\nreversing the signs of \u03bc and \u03bb.) The Hamiltonian H\nthereby is rewritten as\nZ\n\u221e\nX\nH = dy0\n\u03c8n\u2020 \u01ebn \u03c8n ,\n(2.10)\n\n(2.9)\n\nThere is a common level shift of O(z\u03bb2 ) while the tiny\nlevel splitting \u223c \u03c9c \u03bcz \u226a \u03c9c is practically unchanged (for\n\u03bb \u223c 0.3).

We omit it here, and\nsimply remark that the current has a component coming\nfrom the O(\u03bcz) asymmetry as well.\nIII.\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC RESPONSE\n\nIn this section we study the electromagnetic response\nof bilayer graphene. Let us first consider the polarization\nfunction P (p, \u03c9)(\u223c \u2212i h\u03c1\u03c1i) in Fourier space,\no\nXn\n1\n1\nP (p, \u03c9) = \u2212\n\u03c3nk (p),\n+\n\u01ebkn \u2212 \u03c9 \u01ebkn + \u03c9\nk,n\n\n\f4\n\u03c3nk (p) =\n\n1 \u2212l2 p2 /2\ne\n|gkn (p)|2 ,\n2\u03c0l2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u01ebkn = \u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebn ; the sum is taken over occupied\nlevels {n} and unoccupied levels {k}. In what follows\nwe focus on the real part of P (p, \u03c9) in the static limit\n\u03c9 \u2192 0, and denote the components coming from the\nvirtual (n \u2192 k \u2192 n) transitions as\nPnk (p) = \u2212\n\n1 1 \u2212l2 p2 /2\ne\n|gkn (p)|2 .\n\u03c0l2 \u01ebkn\n\nP (p, 0)|\u03bd=0 =\n\nk\nP\u2212n\n(p).\n\n(3.3)\n\nSome care is needed in carrying out sums over an infinite\nnumber of Landau levels, which are potentially singular.\nFor regularization we here choose, as before,23 to truncate the spectrum to a finite interval \u2212N \u2264 n, k \u2264 N\nand let N \u2192 \u221e in the very end. Regularization not\nonly keeps calculations under control but also refines\nthem: Actually, instead of Eq. (3.3), one may first consider, for a given level n, the polarization \"per level\"\nPN\nk\nover all levels k but n,\nPn =\nk=\u2212N Pn by summing\nP\nand then obtain P (p, 0) = n Pn by summing over filled\nlevels n. This gives the same result as Eq. (3.3) owing to\nthe antisymmetry Pnk = \u2212Pkn .\nEquation (3.3) is an expression for the \u03c8 sector (P \u2192\nP \u03c8 ). For the charge operator \u03c1\u03c7 = \u03c7\u2020 \u03c7 in the \u03c7 sector\none may replace, in Eq. (2.11), gkn (p) by\n\n(3.7)\n\nfor 2 \u2264 |n| \u2264 N \u2212 1, and\n(2)\n\nP1\n\n(2)\n\n+ P0+ = \u2212(p2 /2\u03c0\u03c9c ) 2|\u03bc|.\n\n(3.8)\n\n(2)\n\n\u22121\nThe bottom of the Dirac sea yields P\u2212N = (P (2) )N\n\u2212N +\n\u2212(N \u22121)\n\n(P (2) )\u2212N\n\n\u221d N \u2212 1 + O(1/N ), which properly makes\nPN\n(2)\nP |\u03bd=0 = n=2 P\u2212n finite. This leads to the vacuum\nelectric susceptibility (per valley and spin)\ne2\nF (\u03bc),\n2\u03c0 \u03c9c\nN\n\u22121\nX\nF (\u03bc) = \u2212\n\u03b2n \u2212 |\u03bc| + N \u2212 1,\n\u03b1vac\n=\ne\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis implies, in particular, that the \u03c8 and \u03c7 sectors contribute equally to the vacuum polarization\nP \u03c8 (p, 0)|\u03bd=0 = P \u03c7 (p, 0)|\u03bd=0 , and also that P (p, 0) =\nP \u03c8 (p)+P \u03c7 (p) is the same for the charge-conjugate states\nwith \u03bd = \u00b1 integer. (In view of this, we shall focus on\nthe case \u03bd \u2265 0 from now on.)\nIn calculating the density response we suppose that the\nalmost degenerate zero-mode levels at each valley remain\npractically inseparable and treat them as both occupied\nor empty; accordingly we set z \u2192 0 below. Let us first\n\n(3.9)\n\nn=2\n\n\u2248 0.87715 \u2212 |\u03bc| + O(\u03bc2 ).\n\n(3.10)\n\nAn alternative expression for this \u03b1vac\nis obtained by\ne\nsumming up the virtual (\u2212n \u2192 n \u00b1 1) processes, or\nPN \u22121 n+1\nPN\nn\u22121\nn=2 P\u2212n , which yields\nn=2 P\u2212n +\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\ni\nh\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 3\n2(\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u01eb\n)\n\u2212\n(\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u01eb\n)\nn+1\nn\nn+1\nn\n4 \u01eb\u2032n \u01eb\u2032n+1\nn=1\n\u221a\nN\n\u22121 \u221a\nX\n( n + 1 \u2212 n\u22121)3\n\u221a\n=\n\u2212 |\u03bc| + O(\u03bc2 ), (3.11)\n4\nn\nn=1\n\nF (\u03bc) =\n\n(3.4)\n\ni.e., with the sign of \u03bc reversed. One can define (P \u03c7 )kn (p)\naccordingly and write the vacuum polarization function\nPN PN\n\u03c7 k\nas P \u03c7 (p, 0)|\u03bd=0 =\nk=2\nn=0 (P )\u2212n (p). Note that\nthese components enjoy the following property\n\u03c7 n\n(P \u03c8 )k\u2212n = \u2212(P \u03c8 )\u2212n\nk = (P )\u2212k .\n\n\u03b2n\n\n(3.6)\n\n(2)\n\nk=0 n=2\n\n\u03c7\ngkn\n(p) = g\u2212k,\u2212n (p),\n\n\u0011\np2 \u0010\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03b2n \u2212\n2\u03c0 \u03c9c\n|n|(|n| \u2212 1)\n|n| \u2212 1/2\n= sn p\n,\n|n|(|n| \u2212 1) + \u03bc2\n\nPn(2) = \u2212\n\n(3.2)\n\nActually |gkn (p)|2 = gnk (\u2212p) gkn (p) are functions of\nl2 p2 and are thus symmetric in (k, n), which implies the\nrelation Pnk = \u2212Pkn .\nFor conventional QH systems the polarization function\nvanishes for the vacuum since the charge operator trivially annihilates the vacuum \u03c1|\u03bd = 0i = 0. For graphene,\nin contrast, \u03c1|\u03bd = 0i 6= 0 because of pair creation from\nthe Dirac sea, and even the vacuum acquires nonzero polarization\nN X\nN\nX\n\nlook into the leading long-wavelength part \u223c O(p2 ) of\nP (p, 0), to be denoted as P (2) (p, 0), which is related to\nthe electric susceptibility \u03b1e = \u2212(e2 /p2 ) P (2) (p, 0). A\nlook into the matrix elements in Eq. (2.12) shows that\n(2)\nPn (p, 0) derives only from virtual transitions to the adjacent levels (n \u2192 n \u00b1 1) and the related ones across the\nDirac sea (n \u2192 \u2212n \u00b1 1). A direct calculation then yields\n\np\nwhere \u01eb\u2032n = n(n \u2212 1) + \u03bc2 .\nEquations (3.6) and (3.8) tell us that the susceptibility\ncarried by a positive-energy level of the same n is slightly\ndifferent by O(\u03bc) terms at the two valleys. Such O(\u03bc)\ncorrections are visible only for the zero-mode levels since\nthe two valleys are practically indistinguishable for n \u2265 2\n(up to O(\u03bcz) splitting). Let us suppose that the electrons\nfill up an integral number \u03bd of Landau levels, with\nP uniform density h\u03c1i \u2261 \u03c1\u0304 = \u03bd/(2\u03c0l2 ). We write \u03bd = n \u03bdn in\nterms of the filling factors \u03bdn of the nth level [ 0 \u2264 \u03bdn \u2264 4\nfor n \u2265 2 and 0 \u2264 \u03bd{1,0} \u2264 4; \u03bd{1,0} \u2261 \u03bd1 +\u03bd0+ ], with both\nvalley and spin taken into account. The electric susceptibility at integer filling \u03bd is then written as\n\u03b1e =\n\no\nX\ne2 n\n4F (\u03bc) + \u03bd{1,0} |\u03bc| +\n\u03bdn \u03b2n .\n2\u03c0 \u03c9c\nn\u22652\n\n(3.12)\n\n\f5\n12\n\n14\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n\n8\n6\n\n0.5\n\n4\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\ngap \u221d |\u03bc| while the n \u2265 2 levels are shifted only slowly,\nas seen from Fig. 1. The growth of \u03b1e is therefore due\nto a decrease in activation gap from the zero-mode levels. This implies that the dielectric effect due to the zero\nmodes, though negligible for |\u03bc| \u226a 1, becomes dominant\nfor large gaps |\u03bc| \u223c 1.\nThis is also the case with the full expression for the\npolarization P (p, 0), which one can evaluate numerically\nusing Eqs. (2.12) and (3.2). In Fig. 2 (b) we plot the\nsusceptibility function \u03b1e [p] = \u2212(e2 /p2 ) P (p, 0) at \u03bd =0,\n4, 8, 12 for zero band gap and for a finite gap. There,\nas in the monolayer case, the zero-mode levels scarcely\ncontribute to \u03b1e [p] for zero gap, but one sees clearly that,\nas the band gap \u221d \u03bc develops, they make \u03b1e [p] distinct\nbetween the vacuum and the \u03bd = 4 state.\nThe susceptibility is also related to screening properties of graphene. Let us now turn on the Coulomb\ninteraction v = \u03b1/(\u01ebb |x|) or vp = 2\u03c0\u03b1/(\u01ebb |p|) with\n\u03b1 = e2 /(4\u03c0\u01eb0 ) \u2248 1/137 and the substrate dielectric constant \u01ebb , and study its effects in the random-phase approximation (RPA). The RPA dielectric function is written as27\n\u01eb(p, \u03c9) = 1 \u2212 vp P (p, \u03c9).\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Electric susceptibility \u03b1e decreases\nwith the band gap 2|\u03bc| \u03c9c for \u03bd = 0 and rises for \u03bd =4, 8\nand 12.

For the\nsusceptibility one finds \u03b2n = 1 for n \u2265 2, and F (1/2) =\n1/2. This yields\n\u03b1e |\u03bc=1/2 = (2\u03b4\u03bd 0 + \u03bd) e2 /(2\u03c0 \u03c9c ),\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich rises linearly with \u03bd = 4, 8, 12, * * *.\nIn Fig. 2 (a) we plot \u03b1e as a function of the band gap\n2|\u03bc| \u03c9c for \u03bd = 0, 4, 8 and 12. The vacuum susceptibility\n\u03b1vac\n= \u03b1e |\u03bd=0 is almost comparable to the contribution\ne\nof the filled n = 2 level for \u03bc \u223c 0. The \u03b1vac\ndecreases\ne\ngradually as the band gap \u221d \u03bc develops; this is clear intuitively. In contrast, when the zero-mode levels get filled,\ni.e., at \u03bd = 4, \u03b1e starts to grow almost linearly with \u03bc,\nand such characteristic behavior persists for higher \u03bd as\nwell. This is somewhat unexpected but is easy to understand: The zero-mode levels move linearly with the band\n\n(3.14)\n\nFigure 2 (c) shows the static\u221a\nfunction \u01eb(p, 0)\u22121 for \u03bd = 0,\n4, 8, 12, plotted in units of 2\u03b1/(\u01ebb \u03c9c l). Note first that\nthere is no screening at long distances, \u01eb(p, 0) \u2192 1 for\np \u2192 0, as is typical of two-dimensional systems. As wave\nvector |p| is increased, \u01eb(p, 0) grows rapidly, becomes sizable for |p|l \u223c 1, and then decreases only gradually for\nlarger |p|. Such profiles of \u01eb(p, 0) and \u03b1e [p] in Fig. 2 are\nqualitatively quite similar to those of monolayer graphene\nstudied earlier.23\nStill there are some clear differences: (1) Note that the\nbasic Landau gap of bilayer graphene, \u03c9c \u2248 45 B[T] K,\nis about one-order of magnitude\nsmaller than the monop\nlayer gap \u03c9cmono \u2248 400 B[T] K at B=1T, or\np\n\u03c9c /\u03c9cmono \u2248 0.1 B[T].\n(3.15)\n\nNumerically it turns out that, for both monolayer and bilayer graphene, the vacuum susceptibility \u03b1vac\nis around\ne\n3 in units of e2 /(2\u03c0 \u03c9c ) and the\n\u221a peak value of \u01eb(p, 0)|\u03bd=0 \u2212\n1 is around 1.8 in units of 2\u03b1/(\u01ebb \u03c9c l). This actually\nmeans that \u01eb(p, 0) and \u03b1e [p] are numerically more sizable for bilayers than for monolayers. In particular, for\nthe bilayer the peak value of \u01eb(p, 0) in Fig. 2 (c) would\nrange from \u01eb(p, 0) \u2248 9.5 \u223c 18 \u221a\nfor \u03bd = 0 \u223c 12, with the\nchoice \u01ebb \u2248 4 and B = 1T, or 2\u03b1/(\u01ebb \u03c9c l) \u2248 5.1. (The\nvalue of the substrate dielectric constant \u01ebb depends on\nthe structure of the sample; with SiO2 on both sides of\nthe bilayer, e.g., one can set \u01ebb \u2248 \u01ebSiO2 \u2248 4.) This implies\nthat the Coulomb interaction is very efficiently screened\n(and weakened) in bilayer graphene.\n(2) For graphene, unlike standard QH systems, even\nthe \u03bd = 0 vacuum state has an appreciable amount of\npolarization \u01eb(p, 0) \u2212 1 over a wide range of wavelengths,\nwhich reflects the quantum fluctuations or \"echoes\" of\n\n\f6\nIV.\n\n0.8\n\nEFFECTIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Exciton spectra at \u03bd=0 and 4 for |\u03bc| =\n0.1, in units of \u03b1/\u01ebb l.

The echoes\nare in a sense \"harder\" for monolayer graphene23 for\nwhich \u01eb(p, 0) appears almost constant over the wavevector range in Fig. 2 (c). The rise of the peak values of \u01eb(p, 0) \u2212 1 with filling factor \u03bd is more prominent\nfor monolayers than bilayers; see Eq. (4.6). These features reflect the difference in the underlying Landau-level\nstructures.\n(3) In bilayer graphene, unlike in monolayers, the effects of the zero-mode Landau levels become visible as\nthe band gap \u221d 2|\u03bc| develops and this makes the \u03bd = 0\nand \u03bd = 4 states distinguishable in \u01eb(p, 0) and \u03b1e [p].\nIn the RPA the response function is written as\nPRPA (p, \u03c9) = P (p, \u03c9)/\u01eb(p, \u03c9), from which one can derive28 the inter-Landau-level excitation spectra corrected\nby the Coulomb interaction.

As a result of screening,\n\u25b3\u01ebk,n (p) \u221d 1/\u01eb(p, 0), one would observe prominent reduction in magnitude of the exciton spectra; see Fig. 3.\n\nIn this section we study low-energy response of bilayer\ngraphene and construct an effective gauge theory. Let\nus consider the Hall conductance which is read from a\nresponse of the form 21 \u03c3H (Ax \u2202t Ay \u2212 Ay \u2202t Ax ); it is calculated from the current-current correlation function and\nfrom Berry's phase as well.14 A direct calculation similar\nto the one in the monolayer case23 shows that \u03c3H \u2192 e2 l2\nper electron so that \u03c3H \u2192 e2 /(2\u03c0h\u0304) = e2 /h per filled\nlevel. The result is independent of \u03bb and z.\nCare is needed to determine \u03c3H carried by the vacuum\nstate. As before, we truncate the spectrum and find that\nthe bottom of the Dirac sea contributes \u223c \u2212(N \u2212 1)e2 /h.\nThis yields the vacuum Hall conductance\nvac\n\u03c3H\n(\u03be = \u00b11) = \u2213e2 /h\n\n(4.1)\n\nper valley and spin. This implies that nonzero current\nand charge are induced12,13,14 in the vacua at the two valleys, but they combine to vanish in the vacuum, leaving\nno observable effect. In general, the Hall conductance\n\u03c3H is cast in the form of a spectral asymmetry and the\nvac\nvacuum Hall conductance \u03c3H\nis related to half of the\nindex (2.7).\nThe long-wavelength response of bilayer graphene with\nuniform electron density \u03c1\u0304 is now summarized by the\nLagrangian\nLA = \u03c1\u0304 eA0 \u2212 e2 l2 \u03c1\u0304\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u01eb\nA\u03bc \u2202\u03bd A\u03c1\n2\n\n1\n1\n+ \u03b1e E2k \u2212 \u03b1m (A12 )2 .\n2\n2\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere A0 detects the charge density \u03c1\u0304, \u03b1e is the electric\nsusceptibility in Eq. (3.12) and \u03b1m \u221d e2 l2 \u03c1\u0304/m\u2217 stands\nfor the magnetic susceptibility probed by a local variation\nA12 = \u2202x Ay \u2212 \u2202y Ax about B.\nThis response is essentially the same as that for monolayer graphene,23 except for the values of \u03b1e and \u03b1m . Accordingly the effective theory also takes the same form,\ni.e., a theory of a vector field b\u03bc = (b0 , b1 , b2 ), with the\nLagrangian to O(\u2202 2 ),\n1\n1\nb0 + 2 b\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd b\u03bb\nl2\n2l \u03c1\u0304\n1\n(bk0 )2 \u2212 \u03b4b12 v \u03b4b12\n(4.3)\n2\n\nLeff [b] = \u2212eA\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd b\u03bb +\n+\n\n1\n2l2 \u03c1\u0304 \u03c9eff\n\nand the effective cyclotron frequency\n\u03c9eff = e2 l2 \u03c1\u0304/\u03b1e = \u03c9c g(\u03bd),\n\u03bd\nP\n, (4.4)\ng(\u03bd) =\n4F (\u03bc2 ) + \u03bd{1,0} |\u03bc| + n\u22652 \u03bdn \u03b2n\n\nP\nwhere b\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc b\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd b\u03bc ; l2 \u03c1\u0304 = \u03bd/(2\u03c0) and \u03bd =\n\u03bdn .\nAn advantage of bosonization29,30 is that it allows one\nto handle the Coulomb interaction exactly; it is included in Eq. (4.3) with shorthand notation \u03b4b12 v \u03b4b12 =\n\n\f7\nd2 y \u03b4b12 (x) v(x\u2212y)\u03b4b12 (y) and \u03b4b12 = b12 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304. (We\nhave omitted the \u03b1m term from Leff [b] since the Coulomb\ninteraction overtakes it at long wavelengths.)\nThis effective Lagrangian not only reproduces the original response (4.2), but also shows that the Coulomb interaction vp = 2\u03c0\u03b1/(\u01ebb |p|) substantially modifies the dispersion of the cyclotron mode at long wavelengths p \u2192 0,\n\nR\n\n\u03c9(p) \u2248 \u03c9eff +\n\n1 2\n(l \u03c1\u0304 vp + * * *) p2 ,\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere * * * involves \u03b1m /(\u03b1e \u03c9eff ), if \u03b1m is recovered. This\nexcitation spectrum is in good agreement with the RPA\nresult (3.16) at long wavelengths; the filling factor \u03bd =\n2\u03c0l2 \u03c1\u0304 in Eq. (4.5) corresponds to \u03bdg (0) in Eq. (3.16).\nFor graphene the Landau levels are not equally spaced\nand the excitation gaps depend on the level index n\nor \u03bd. At \u03bd = 4n (n \u2265 1), e.g., the minimum gap is\np\np\n(n)\n\u25b3\u03c9c = ( n(n + 1) + \u03bc2 \u2212 n(n \u2212 1) + \u03bc2 ) \u03c9c , and\n\u03c9eff in Eq. (4.4) represents such an activation gap.\nIn particular, at \u03bd = 4 where the zero-mode levels are\nfilled, the effective gap \u221d g(4) = 1/[F (\u03bc) + \u03bc] derives\nsolely from the vacuum\np fluctuations; it deviates from the\n(1)\ntrue gap \u25b3\u03c9c = ( 2 + \u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc) \u03c9c by about 20% for\n\u03bc = 0 and by 5% or less for \u03bc > 0.4. At \u03bd = 8, \u03c9eff\n(2)\nand \u25b3\u03c9c agree within 1.1% for all \u03bc. The agreement\nis almost exact for higher \u03bd. It is somewhat surprising\nthat, as in the monolayer case, an effective theory constructed from the long-wavelength response alone gives\nan excellent description of the excitation spectrum. Here\nwe verify again from Eq. (4.4) that the susceptibility \u03b1e\nof a QH system is generally given by a ratio of the Hall\nconductance to the Landau gap,23\n\u03b1e = \u03bd(e2 /h)/\u03c9eff \u2248 \u03c3H /\u25b3\u03c9c(n) .\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis implies that \u03b1e depends on \u03bd and \u03bc nontrivially\nwhile it grows like \u03b1e \u221d \u03bd 3/2 for monolayer graphene.\nV.\n\nZERO-MODE LANDAU LEVELS\n\nIn this section we take a close look into the properties of the zero-mode levels at each valley, with a tiny\nsplitting \u03c9c \u03bcz \u226a \u03c9c . Special care is needed in considering the response from such an almost degenerate sector,\nsince even a weak field applied as a probe may affect the\ntrue eigenmodes. The first task therefore is to resolve\nthe degeneracy of the (0\u2032+ , 1\u2032 ) sector by diagonalizing the\nexternal probe plus the O(\u03bcz) asymmetry,\nZ\nZ\n\u03b4H = \u2212 d2 x eA0 \u03c1 + dy0 \u03c8 \u2020 \u25b3Has \u03c8,\n(5.1)\nwhere \u25b3Has = \u03c9c \u03bcz diag[\u2212a\u2020 a, aa\u2020 ]. We suppose that\nA0 is slowly varying in space and retain only terms up\nto first order in \u2202x , i.e., E = \u2212\u2202x A0 . In practice, it is\nconvenient, without loss of generality, to take A0 (x, t) \u2192\nA0 (y, t), or E k Ey .\n\nWe take the linear kinetic term \u221d \u03bb into account (since\nit may potentially be important at such a low energy\nscale). Within the (0\u2032+ , 1\u2032 ) sector \u03b4H effectively turns31\ninto the matrix Hamiltonian (in y0 space)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03ba b\u2212 (\u03bb)\nE c(\u03bb)\n, (5.2)\n\u2212 eA0 (y0 , t) \u2212 \u03ba b+ (\u03bb) +\nE c(\u03bb) \u2212\u03ba b\u2212 (\u03bb)\n\u221a\nwith\nE\n\u2261\nelE\n/\n2, \u03ba = (1/2) \u03c9c \u03bc z; c(\u03bb) =\ny\nP\u221e \u221a\n3n + 1\u03b1n \u03b6n /(N0 N1 ). Here b\u00b1 (\u03bb) = b1 (\u03bb)\u00b1b0 (\u03bb)\nn=0\nin terms of b0 and b1 defined in Eq. (2.9). Numerically,\nc(\u03bb) = 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03bb4 + * * * ,\nb+ (\u03bb) = 1 + \u03bb2 + 0.086 \u03bb4 + * * * ,\nb\u2212 (\u03bb) = 1 \u2212 0.014 \u03bb4 + * * * .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe O(\u03bb4 ) corrections are practically negligible for \u03bb \u223c\n0.3. We therefore set c(\u03bb) \u2248 b\u2212 (\u03bb) \u2248 1 and may keep\nthe O(\u03bb2 ) correction to b+ (\u03bb).\nThe Hamiltonian (5.2) leads to the level splitting\n\u221a\n\u00b1 \u03ba2 + E 2 with the new eigenmodes 0\u2032\u2032+ and 1\u2032\u2032 related\nto 0\u2032+ and 1\u2032 via the unitary transformation \u03c80\u2032\u2032+ =\n\u221a\n\u03c80\u2032+ cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c81\u2032 sin \u03b8, with tan 2\u03b8 = el Ey /( 2 \u03ba). Here\nwe see that an inplane electric field enhances the splitting of the zero-mode levels, with a gap\nq\n\u25b3\u01eb = \u03c9c (\u03bc z)2 + 2e2 l2 E2k /\u03c9c2 .\n(5.4)\nThis shows, unexpectedly, that the zero-mode level gap\nis controllable with an injected Hall current.\nFor a rough estimate let us note the following: If we\ntake \u03bc \u223c 0.05, the level gap is \u03c9c \u03bc z \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 meV at\nB = 1T, with \u03bcz \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 B[T]; an applied field of\nstrength Ek \u223c 1V/cm leads to a level gap of roughly the\nsame magnitude, as seen from\n\u221a\n2el|E|/\u03c9c \u223c 10\u22123 \u00d7 E[V/cm]/B[T]3/2 .\n(5.5)\nOne can calculate the spectral weight \u223c |h0\u2032\u2032 |\u03c1p |1\u2032\u2032 i|2\nand derive the susceptibility function associated with the\n1\u2032\u2032 \u2192 0\u2032\u2032+ transition,\n0\u2032\u2032\n\n(\u03b1e [p])1+\n=\n\u2032\u2032\n\ngs e2 \u2212x 1 + (x/4) E 2 /\u03ba2\n,\ne\n2\u03c0 \u25b3\u01eb\n1 + E 2 /\u03ba2\n\n(5.6)\n\nwith x = l2 p2 /2 and spin degeneracy gs = 2. (Here we\nhave set \u03bb \u2192 0 for clarity; there is no appreciable change\nfor \u03bb \u223c 0.3.) This \u03b1e [p], with its scale set by the tiny\ngap \u25b3\u01eb \u226a \u03c9c , essentially governs the dielectric property\nof the \u03bd = 2 state.\nFigure 4 shows \u03b1e [p] and the associated dielectric function \u01eb(p, 0) \u2212 1 at \u03bd = \u03bd1\u2032\u2032 = 2. It is seen that both\nof them decrease rapidly as Ek becomes strong in the\n\u221a\nsequence 2el|Ek |/(\u03c9c |\u03bc|z) = 0, 1, 2, 5; this is because\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nRthe2 1 and 0+ modes are chosen so as to diagonalize\nd x A0 \u03c1 (for \u03ba \u2192 0).

This would lead to \u03b1e [0] \u223c 14 and (the peak value\nof \u01eb(p, 0) \u2212 1) \u223c 30 in common units, i.e., one-order of\nmagnitude larger than those in Fig. 2. This suggests that\nthe dielectric effect would show a marked enhancement\naround \u03bd \u223c 2 if the level gap is resolved by an inplane\nfield at very low temperatures.\nActually, a larger gap, which leads to better level resolution, tends to suppress the effect. Alternatively it will\nbe more practical to observe the field-induced level gap\n\u25b3\u01eb(Ek ) via the QH effect with an injected current; one\nwould be able to resolve the \u03bd = \u00b12 Hall plateaus using a suitably strong current (that may even suppress\nthe dielectric effect). It will also be possible to detect\nthe level gap directly by micro-wave absorption or via\nconductance modulations32 associated with it.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have studied the electromagnetic response of bilayer graphene in a magnetic field at integer\nfilling factor \u03bd, with emphasis on clarifying the similarities and differences in quantum features between monolayers and bilayers. Bilayer graphene has a unique feature\nthat its band gap is externally controllable; this makes\nbilayers richer in electronic properties.\nThe particle-hole picture of the vacuum state is one of\nthe basic features specific to graphene, both monolayers\nand multilayers, and is not shared with conventional QH\n\n1\n\nK. S. Novoselov, A. K. Geim, S. V. Morozov, D. Jiang,\nM. I. Katsnelson, I. V. Grigorieva, S. V. Dubonos, and\n\nsystems. In graphene even the vacuum state responds to\nan external field and acts as a dielectric medium, with\nthe Coulomb interaction being efficiently screened over\nthe scale of the magnetic length. Graphene bilayers and\nmonolayers are qualitatively quite similar in the vacuum\ndielectric characteristics (apart from some differences\nthat reflect the underlying Landau-level structures), as\nwe have seen in Sec. III, but numerically the dielectric\neffect (for the vacuum and for \u03bd 6= 0 as well) is generally\nmuch more sizable for bilayers because ofp\nthe difference\nin the basic Landau gap, \u03c9cbi /\u03c9cmono \u2248 0.1 B[T].\nThe presence of the zero-energy Landau levels is another basic feature specific to graphene. The monolayer\nsupports four zero-mode levels (one per valley and spin),\nwhile the bilayer supports eight such levels (two per valley and spin). The zero-mode levels carry normal Hall\nconductance e2 /h per level, but in monolayers their effect is hardly visible in density response. In contrast,\nin bilayer graphene a gate-controlled interlayer field acts\nto open a band gap between the zero-mode levels at the\ntwo valleys and this valley gap, in a sense, activates them:\nThe dielectric effect due to the pseudo-zero-mode levels\ngrows linearly with the band gap and becomes dominant\nfor large gaps, as we have seen in Sec. III.\nA finite band gap introduces an asymmetry in the zeromode spectrum while it leaves other levels practically\nsymmetric. The two zero-mode levels (per spin) at each\nvalley thereby remain degenerate, apart from a tiny kinetic splitting. This robustness in the zero-mode degeneracy at each valley as well as the presence of the zero\nmodes itself is a consequence of the nonzero index (2.7) of\nthe basic bilayer Hamiltonian (with A0 \u2192 0 and z \u2192 0).\nIn Sec. V we have pointed out that this tiny zero-mode\nlevel gap at each valley is enhanced (and even controlled)\nby an inplane electric field or by an injected current. Such\na gap, if properly enhanced by an injected current, may\nbe detected via the QH effect or directly via micro-wave\nabsorption.\nFinally, in Sec. IV we have noted that the low-energy\ncharacteristics of bilayer graphene are neatly summarized\nby an effective Chern-Simons gauge theory, which accommodates graphene and standard QH systems equally well.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank A.
