A concise description of the protocol for teleporting a qubit can be described\nas follows1 : The sender Alice has a source qubit which she wants to send to Bob and\nshare with Bob an entangled pair, an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair2 . Alice does a\nBell measurement on the source qubit and her half of the EPR pair, projecting the target\nqubit hold by Bob into a state being the same as the original state of the source qubit\nup to a unitary transformation. Then Bob rotate the target qubit into the original state\nof the source qubit based on the two bits of classical information from Alice. The details\nof the protocol are shown in Fig.1: Alice performs a controlled-NOT (C-NOT) operation\non her two qubits, using the source qubit as the control line. Then perform a Hadamard\ntransformation on the source qubit. Alice then performs a measurement on her two qubits.\nAfter the measurement, Alice sends Bob two bits of classical information about the result\nof her measurement, which is used by Bob to rotate the target qubit into the correct state.\nQuantum teleportation using pairs of entangled photons3,4,5,6,7,8 and atoms9,10 have been\ndemonstrated experimentally. There are also schemes suggesting using electrons to perform\nquantum teleportation11,12,13 .\nIn this paper, we study the quantum entanglement in an array of quantum dots and\npropose a scheme to perform quantum teleportation in this system. We show that the space\nentanglement and spin entanglement contained in the quantum dots system modeled by\nthe one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian can be applied selectively to perform quantum\nteleportation.\nQuantum entanglement is one of the most important concepts in quantum information\ntheory and quantum computation. It is key to the implementation of quantum information\nprocessing technology. It has been realized that quantum entanglement can be used as a\ncontrollable physical resource14 . Theoretically, finding a measure for the quantum entanglement is an important issue. For the fermion system, we choose Zanardi's measure15 , which\nis given in Fock space as the von Neumann entropy.\nQuantum dots system is one of the proposals for building a quantum computer17,18 . To\ndescribe the quantum dots, a simple approximation is to regard each dot as having one\nvalence orbital, the electron occupation could be |0 >, | \u2191>, | \u2193> and | \u2191\u2193>, with other\n\nelectrons treated as core electrons19 . The valence electron can tunnel from a given dot to its\nnearest neighbor obeying the Pauli principle and thereby two dots can be coupled together,\n2\n\n\fthis is the electron hopping effect. Another effect needs to be considered is the on-site\nelectron-electron repulsion. A theoretical description of an array of quantum dots can be\nmodeled by the one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian:\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\nc+\ni\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + U\n\n<ij>,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere t stands for the electron hopping parameter, U is the Coulomb repulsion parameter\nfor electrons on the same site, i and j are the neighboring site numbers, c+\ni\u03c3 and cj\u03c3 are\nthe creation and annihilation operators.\nEntanglement using Zanardi's measure can be formulated as the von Neumann entropy\ngiven by\n\nEj = \u2212T r(\u03c1j log2 \u03c1j )\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c1j = T rj (|\u03a8 >< \u03a8|)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T rj denotes the trace over all but the jth site and |\u03a8 > is the antisymmetric wave\nfunction of the fermion system. Hence Ej actually describes the entanglement of the jth\nsite with the remaining sites.\nIn the Hubbard model, the electron occupation of each site has four possibilities, there are\nfour possible local states at each site, |\u03bd >j = |0 >j , | \u2191>j , | \u2193>j , | \u2191\u2193>j . The entanglement\nof the jth site with the other sites is given by20\n\nEj = \u2212zLog 2 z \u2212 u+ Log 2 u+ \u2212 u\u2212 Log 2 u\u2212 \u2212 wLog2 w\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c1j = z|0 >< 0| + u+ | \u2191><\u2191 | + u\u2212 | \u2193><\u2193 | + w| \u2191\u2193><\u2191\u2193 |\n\n(5)\n\nw =< nj\u2191 nj\u2193 >= T r(nj\u2191 nj\u2193 \u03c1j )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere,\n\nu\u2212 =< nj\u2193 > \u2212w\n\nu+ =< nj\u2191 > \u2212w,\n\nz = 1 \u2212 u+ \u2212 u\u2212 \u2212 w = 1\u2212 < nj\u2191 > \u2212 < nj\u2193 > +w\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe Hubbard Hamiltonian can be rescaled to have only one parameter U/t.\nFor the one-dimensional Hubbard model with half-filled electrons, we have < n\u2191 >=<\nn\u2193 >= 21 , u+ = u\u2212 =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 w , and the local entanglement is given by\n3\n\n\f1\n1\nEj = \u22122wlog 2 w \u2212 2( \u2212 w)log 2 ( \u2212 w)\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nFor each site the entanglement is the same. Consider the particle-hole symmetry of the\nmodel, we can see that w(\u2212U) = 12 \u2212 w(U), so the local entanglement is an even function of\nU. As shown in Fig. 2, the minimum of the entanglement is 1 as U \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. As U \u2192 +\u221e\nall the sites are singly occupied the only difference is the spin of the electrons on each site,\nwhich can be referred as the spin entanglement. As U \u2192 \u2212\u221e, all the sites are either doubly\noccupied or empty, which is referred as the space entanglement. The maximum entanglement\nis 2 at U = 0, which is the sum of the spin and space entanglement of the system. In Fig.\n2 we show the entanglement for two sites and two electrons, they qualitatively agree with\nthat of the Bethe ansatz solution for an array of sites20 .\nGittings and Fisher16 showed that the entanglement in this system can be used in quantum teleportation. However, in their scheme both the charge and spin of the system are\nused to construct the unitary transformation. In this paper, we propose a different scheme\nto perform quantum teleportation. For two half-filled coupled quantum dots, under the\nconservation of the total number of electrons N = 2 and the total electron spin S = 0,\na quantum entanglement of 2, two ebits can be produced according to Zanardi's measure.\nLet us describe the teleportation scheme using three cites, A, B and C. Suppose the qubit\n\u03b1| \u2191> +\u03b2| \u2193> will be teleported from site A, Alice, to site B, Bob, where the two sites B\nand C are in an entangled state,\n1\n1\n+\n+\n+\n|\u03a8 >= \u221a ( c+\nC\u2191 + cB\u2191 ) \u221a ( cC\u2193 + cB\u2193 )|0 > .\n2\n2\n\n(10)\n\nA spin-up electron and a spin-down electron are in a delocalized state on sites C and B.\nIn the occupation number basis | nC\u2191 nC\u2193 nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >, the state of the system can be written\nas:\n\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\n+\n|\u03a8 >= \u221a ( c+\nC\u2191 + cB\u2191 ) \u221a ( cC\u2193 + cB\u2193 )|0 >= (|0011 > +|1100 > +|1001 > +|0110 >).\n2\n2\n2\n(11)\nFrom the state described by Eq. (10) we can see that in the basis of | nC\u2191 nC\u2193 >, there\nare four possible states: |00 >, |11 >, |10 >, |01 >. Corresponding to each of the states on\nsite C, the states on site B are: |11 >, |00 >, |01 >, |10 > in the occupation number basis\n4\n\n\f| nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >. Under the restriction of the conservation of total number of electrons and total\nspin of the system, two ebits can be obtained, one is in the spatial degree of freedom, and\nthe other is in the spin degree of freedom. In the basis of | nC\u2191 nC\u2193 nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >, the two ebits\nare:\n1\n\u03b20 = \u221a (|1100 > +|0011 >),\n2\n\n1\n\u03b21 = \u221a (|1001 > +|0110 >)\n2\n\n(12)\n\nThese two ebits can be used in quantum teleportation. The C-NOT operation in the\noccupation number basis | nA\u2191 nA\u2193 nC\u2191 nC\u2193 > is given by:\n|1000 >\u2194 |1011 >, |1010 >\u2194 |1001 >, |01 nC\u2191 nC\u2193 >\u2194 |01 nC\u2191 nC\u2193 >\n\n(13)\n\nFor the ebit \u03b20 , in the quantum teleportation process, in basis | nA\u2191 nA\u2193 >\n| nC\u2191 nC\u2193 nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >, as shown in Fig. 1, we have:\n1\n(14)\n|\u03a80 >= (\u03b1|10 > +\u03b2|01 >) (|1100 > +|0011 > +|1001 > +|0110 >)\n2\n1\n1\n(15)\n|\u03a81 >= \u03b1|10 > \u221a (|0000 > +|1111 >) + \u03b2|01 > \u221a (|1100 > +|0011 >)\n2\n2\n1\n1\n|\u03a82 >= \u03b1(|10 > +|01 >) (|0000 > +|1111 >) + \u03b2(|10 > \u2212|01 >) (|1100 > +|0011 >)\n2\n2\n(16)\nWhen Alice does the measurement M1 and M2 , the following results can be obtained:\n\n|M1 M2 >\n\n| nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >\n\n|1011 >\n\n\u03b1|11 > +\u03b2|00 >\n\n|1000 >\n\n\u03b1|00 > +\u03b2|11 >\n\n|0111 >\n\n\u03b1|11 > \u2212\u03b2|00 >\n\n|0100 >\n\n\u03b1|00 > \u2212\u03b2|11 >\n\n(17)\n\nThen after doing a unitary transformation using double electron occupation and zero\nelectron occupation as basis, the source qubit can be obtain on site B. For this system the\nHamiltonian to perform the C-NOT operation is given by:\n\n5\n\n\fH = |10 >A\n\nA\n\n< 10|(|11 >C\n\nC\n\n< 00| + |00 >C\n\nC\n\n< 11|) +\n\n|01 >A A < 01|(|11 >C C < 11| + |00 >C C < 00|)\n1\n+\n= (\u03c3Z,A + 1)( c+\nC\u2191 cC\u2193 + cC\u2191 cC\u2193 )+\n2\n1\n+\n+\n+\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3Z,A )( c+\nC\u2191 cC\u2193 cC\u2191 cC\u2193 + cC\u2191 cC\u2193 cC\u2191 cC\u2193 ),\n2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c3Z,A is the Pauli matrix. We can see that by using this Hamiltonian, the spin entanglement of the system is filtered, the space entanglement is used in the process. An important\npoint is that the original state we try to teleport is in a superposition state of electron\nspin up and spin down. However, after the teleportation process, the state we obtain on\nsite B is a superposition state of double electron occupation and zero electron occupation.\nThe information based on spin has been transformed to information based on charge, but\nthe information content is not changed. It is well known that a difficult task in quantum\ninformation processing and spintronics is the measurement of a single electron spin21 , in the\nscheme above, we changed the quantum information from spin-based to charge-based, thus\nmakes the measurement fairly easier. This is also important in quantum computation based\non electron spin since the readout can be easily measured.\nFor another ebit \u03b21 , in the quantum teleportation process, in basis | nA\u2191 nA\u2193 >\n| nC\u2191 nC\u2193 nB\u2191 nB\u2193 > , we have:\n1\n(19)\n|\u03a80 >= (\u03b1|10 > +\u03b2|01 >) (1100 > +|0011 > +|1001 > +|0110 >)\n2\n1\n1\n(20)\n|\u03a81 >= \u03b1|10 > \u221a (|0101 > +|1010 >) + \u03b2|01 > \u221a (|1001 > +|0110 >)\n2\n2\n1\n1\n|\u03a82 >= \u03b1(|10 > +|01 >) (|0101 > +|1010 > +\u03b2(|10 > \u2212|01 >) (|1001 > +|0110 >)\n2\n2\n(21)\nWhen Alice does the measurement M1 and M2 , the following results can be obtained:\n\n|M1 M2 >\n\n| nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >\n\n|1001 >\n\n\u03b1|01 > +\u03b2|10 >\n\n|1010 >\n\n\u03b1|10 > +\u03b2|01 >\n6\n\n\f|0101 >\n\n\u03b1|01 > \u2212\u03b2|10 >\n\n|0110 >\n\n\u03b1|10 > \u2212\u03b2|01 >\n\n(22)\n\nFor this system the Hamiltonian to perform the C-NOT operation is:\n\nH = |10 >A\n\nA\n\n< 10|(|10 >C\n\nC\n\n< 01| + |01 >C\n\nC\n\n< 10|) +\n\n|01 >A A < 01|(|01 >C C < 01| + |10 >C C < 10|)\n1\n+\n= (\u03c3Z,A + 1)( c+\nC\u2191 cC\u2193 + cC\u2193 cC\u2191 )\n2\n1\n+\n+\n+\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03c3Z,A )( c+\nC\u2191 cC\u2191 cC\u2193 cC\u2193 + cC\u2193 cC\u2193 cC\u2191 cC\u2191 )\n2\n\n(23)\n\nThen after doing a unitary transformation using the electron spin up and spin down as\nbasis the source qubit can be recovered on site B. By using this Hamiltonian for the C-NOT\noperation the space entanglement of the system is filtered, the spin entanglement is used in\nthe process. In the case of using \u03b20 or \u03b21 as ebits, the unitary transformation is performed\nin the occupation number basis of | nB\u2191 nB\u2193 >, using basis |11 >, |00 > or |10 >, |01 >, we\ncan select the basis separately, either charge or spin. We can also choose the Hamiltonians\n(one is related to the spin entanglement and the other is related to space entanglement) for\nthe C-NOT operation, when the Hamiltonian for one ebit is chosen, the ebit corresponding\nto the other Hamiltonian will be filtered.\nFor U 6= 0, the state of the 2-electron 2-sites system can be described as follows:\n\n|\u03a8 >= a1 |1100 > +a2 |0011 > +b1 |1001 > +b2 |0110 >; a21 + a22 + b21 + b22 = 1,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere a1 = a2 , b1 = b2 because of the symmetry in the entangled pairs, such that the\nstate can be written as:\n|\u03a8 >= a\u03b20 + b\u03b21 ; a2 + b2 = 1.\n\n(25)\n\nIf U > 0, the contribution of the spin entanglement to the total entanglement is greater\nthan that of the space entanglement. The probability of getting the ebit |\u03b21 > increases\nas U becomes larger. If U < 0, the contribution of the space entanglement to the total\nentanglement becomes greater than that of the spin entanglement, the probability of getting\n7\n\n\fthe ebit |\u03b20 > increases as U becomes more negative. In the limit of U goes to \u00b1\u221e, only\nspin entanglement or space entanglement will exist. This might be related to the spin charge\nseparation in the Hubbard model22 . In a previous study23 , we showed that the maximum\nentanglement can be reached at U > 0 by introducing asymmetric electron hopping impurity\nto the system. This is very convenient in the quantum information processing. We can\ncontrol the parameter U/t to increase the probability of getting either ebit.\nHere, we discussed implementing quantum teleportation in three-electron system. For\nmore electrons and in the limit of U \u2192 +\u221e there is no double occupation, the system\nreduced to the Heisenberge model, in the magnetic field. The neighboring spins will favor\nthe anti-parallel configuration for the ground state. If the spin at one end is flipped, then\nthe spins on the whole chain will be flipped accordingly due to the spin-spin correlation.\nSuch that the spins at the two ends of the chain are entangled, a spin entanglement, this\ncan be used for quantum teleportation, the information can be transfered through the chain.\nFor U 6= +\u221e, for the N-sites N-electron system with S = 0, the first N \u2212 1 sites entangled\nwith the N-th site in the same way as that of the two-electron two-sites system: if the N-th\nsite has 2 electrons, then the first N \u2212 1 sites will have N \u2212 2 electrons; if the N-th site has\n0 electrons, then the first N \u2212 1 sites will have N electrons; if the N-th site has 1 spin-up\nelectron, then the total spin of the first N \u2212 1 sites will be 1 spin-down; if the N-th site\nhas the 1 spin-down electron, then the total spin of the first N \u2212 1 sites will be 1 spin-up.\nSo the same procedure discussed above can be used for quantum teleportation but the new\nsystem with N-electrons is much more complicated than the previous three electron system.\nMoreover, Alice needs to control the first N \u2212 1 sites and the source qubit. This situation\nis different from the spin chain, this correlation can not be transfered from one end to the\nother.\nIn summary, we have studied the entanglement of an array of quantum dots modeled\nby the one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian and its application in quantum teleportation.\nThe entanglement in this system is a mixture of space and spin entanglement. The application of such entanglement in quantum teleportation process has been discussed, by applying\ndifferent Hamiltonians for the C-NOT operation, we can separate the ebit based on space\nentanglement or spin entanglement and apply it in quantum teleportation process. It turns\nout that if we use the ebit of the space entanglement, we can transform the spin-based\nquantum information to the charge-based quantum information making the measurement\n8\n\n\ffairly easy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported in part by the Purdue Research Foundation.
