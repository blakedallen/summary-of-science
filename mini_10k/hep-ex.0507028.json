This talk reviews an unrepresentative selection of Belle's open-charm and charmonium\nanalyses, focussing on new developments and topics of interest to the DIS community. Highlights\ninclude an X(3872) analysis favoring J PC = 1++ , and the D0 D\u22170 bound-state interpretation.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA talk of this length does not allow even a representative survey of open-charm and\ncharmonium analyses at Belle, so I've made a selection favoring the most interesting\nrecent developments-concerning the exotic X (3872) state-and topics of interest to\nthe deep inelastic scattering community. Due to length limitations, the writeup is even\nmore cursory than the talk. Interested readers should consult the references.\nThe aim of the Belle collaboration is to study violation of the CP symmetry, using\nthe time-dependence of decays of BB pairs. Open-charm and charmonium studies are an\nactive sideline. The KEKB collider [1] produces e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304\ncontinuum events with unprecedented luminosity: both B-decays and the continuum are\ncopious sources of charmed and charmonium states. The Belle detector [2], at the KEKB\ninteraction point, is a general-purpose detector with good particle ID capabilities.\n\nTHE X(3872): QUANTUM NUMBERS AND INTERPRETATION\nThe X (3872), a narrow state decaying to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 , was discovered in B \u2192\nK \u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 decays by Belle [3], and confirmed by three other groups [4]. In subsequent analysis, it has not been possible to match the properties of the X with those of\nan expected cc\u0304 state [5]. Belle has recently reported the observation of X (3872) \u2192 \u03b3 J/\u03c8\nand \u03c9 J/\u03c8 decays [6], confirming that the C-parity of the X must be even. An angular\nanalysis of X (3872) decays has also been performed [7], exploting zeroes in predicted\ndistributions [8] to test various J PC hypotheses. An example is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe X \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 dipion mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2. The rate near the\nkinematic boundary is sensitive to the parity of the X : for C = +1 and even parity, q\u2217J/\u03c8\ndependence is expected (\u03c1 and J/\u03c8 in S-wave, ignoring D-wave admixture); for odd\nparity, (q\u2217J/\u03c8 )3 (P-wave; ignoring F-wave). Fits to the two cases find \u03c7 2 = 43.1 and\n71.0, for 39 degrees of freedom, favoring J ++ hypotheses. J PC = 0++ is disfavored by\nangular distributions, and J PC = 2++ by preliminary evidence for decays to D0 D0 \u03c0 0 [9].\n\n\fevents bin\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n|cos\u03b8| (J/\u03c8 frame)\n\n1.00\n\nevents bin\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n|cos\u03c8| (\u03c1 frame)\n\n1.00\n\nFIGURE 1.

The definition\nof the angles is shown in the sketch on the left. The \u03c7 2 of the fits are (a) 17.7 and (b) 34.2 for 9 degrees\nof freedom, disfavoring 0\u2212+ .

Fits to J ++ (solid) and J +\u2212 (dashed) hypotheses are also shown: see the text.\n\nThe J PC = 1++ hypothesis is consistent with available data; all other assignments\nare disfavored by at least one test. However, the identification of the X (3872) with the\n\u2032 is unlikely: potential model predictions for the \u03c7 \u2032 mass\n1++ charmonium state \u03c7c1\nc1\nare 3953\u20133990 MeV, and shift upward when coupling to open charm is taken into\n\u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 decay would presumably have\naccount [10]. The isospin-violating \u03c7c1\na small partial width, similar to \u0393(\u03c8 (2S) \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 ) = (0.27 \u00b1 0.06) keV [11], to be\ncompared with a total width \u0393 > 1 MeV [10]. This contradicts BaBar's 90% confidence\nlimit B(X (3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 ) > 4.3% [12]. The low ratio of radiative and hadronic\n\u2032 .\npartial widths \u0393(X \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8 )/\u0393(X \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8 ) = 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 [6] also disfavors \u03c7c1\nBy contrast, the observed properties of the X (3872) are consistent with those of a\n0\nD D\u22170 bound state [13]: the mass is within errors of D0 D\u22170 threshold, (+0.6\u00b11.1) MeV;\n\n\fas the mass difference M(D+ D\u2217\u2212 ) \u2212 M(D0 D\u22170 ) = 8.1 MeV is large by comparison,\nisospin violation is natural for such a state, explaining the observation of X (3872) \u2192\n\u03c9 J/\u03c8 and \u03c1 J/\u03c8 decays. These decays are natural within the model of Swanson [13],\nwhere |\u03c9 J/\u03c8 i and |\u03c1 J/\u03c8 i appear as admixtures to the |D0 D\u22170 i wavefunction. A small\nbranching ratio \u0393(X \u2192 \u03b3 J/\u03c8 )/\u0393(X \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 ) is also expected for such a state.\n\nDOUBLE CHARMONIUM PRODUCTION AND THE X(3940)\nThe process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304cc\u0304 was discovered by Belle in both double charmonium (J/\u03c8 \u03b7c )\nand associated charm (J/\u03c8 D(\u2217) X ) production; both processes have unexpectedly large\nrates [15]. Various proposed alternative explanations of the data have been contradicted\nby further tests, including angular analysis and full reconstruction of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7c\nevents [16]. The principal results have recently been confirmed by BaBar [17].\nEvidence for a new state, X (3940), seen in the recoil mass (MX ) spectrum in e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nJ/\u03c8 X events, was presented in 2004 at the Beijing conference [18]. Decays of this state\nfavor DD\u2217 , based on a study of events with reconstructed J/\u03c8 and D mesons. An updated\nanalysis confirming these results is being prepared for publication this summer [19].\n\nOTHER RESULTS (MOSTLY SPECTROSCOPY)\nAn enhancement at \u03c9 J/\u03c8 threshold has been seen in B \u2192 K \u03c9 J/\u03c8 [15]. Interpreted as\na particle (M = (3943 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 13) MeV, \u0393 = (87 \u00b1 22 \u00b1 26) MeV), this \"Y (3940)\" would\nbe exotic: a cc\u0304 state at this mass would be expected to decay to DD(\u2217) , with very small\nbranching fractions for \u03c9 J/\u03c8 and other hadronic charmonium transitions.\nBelle observed the D\u2217sJ (2317) and DsJ (2460) in both continuum production [20] and\nB decays [21], confirming the observations by BaBar and CLEO [22, 23], establishing\nP\n+\n+\nthe DsJ (2460)+ \u2192 \u03b3 D+\ns decay, and favoring J (DsJ (2460)) = 1 , based on the \u03b3 Ds\n\u2217\n+\n0\n+\nP\n+\nhelicity angle distribution. Study of DsJ (2317) \u2192 \u03c0 Ds [24] likewise favors J = 0 .\n0 +\nSearches for the DsJ (2632)+ \u2192 D+\ns \u03b7 and D K state of SELEX [25] find no evidence\nof production in B decays or the continuum at Belle [26].\nAmongst other charmed baryon results, a new isospin triplet \u03a3c (2800) decaying to\n+\n\u039bc \u03c0 \u2212,0,+ has been observed in the continuum [27]. It is tentatively identified as the \u03a3c2\n(J P = 3/2), with some admixture of the \u03a3c1 (with the same quantum numbers).\nOf the Belle pentaquark searches reported in 2004 [28], the most important uses\ninteractions of kaons (from e+ e\u2212 annihilation) with the material of the detector. This\nstudy placed a limit on production of the \u0398(1540) relative to the \u039b(1520): an updated\nanalysis, to be published in the summer of 2005 [29], also bounds the rate of exclusive\nproduction K + n \u2192 \u0398(1540)+ \u2192 pKS0 , with similar sensitivity\u221ato that of DIANA [30].\nA major study of charm fragmentation in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304 at s \u2243 10.6 GeV will also\nbe submitted for publication this summer [31]. Fractional momentum distributions for\nD, Ds , and D\u2217 mesons, and the \u039b+\nc , are measured with much greater precision than in\nprevious studies; a comparison of fragmentation functions is also presented.\n\n\fSUMMARY\nRecent Belle analyses include a study of X (3872) decays and properties, favouring\nJ PC = 1++ and the D0 D\u22170 molecular model. Other contributions to spectroscopy include\nthe Y (3940), double charmonium production (including e+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 X (3940)), and\npentaquark searches. A study of charm fragmentation has also been performed. Many\nother results in charm and charmonium studies lie outside the scope of this talk.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI'd like to thank my colleagues at Belle for their help in preparing this talk, and the\norganisers of the Deep Inelastic Scattering workshop.
