INTRODUCTION\n\nThe bound state spectrum of the massive Thirring model has been studied by several methods. Unfortunately,\nseveral different methods give different results on the spectrum of the bound state. Dashen et al. investigated the\nbound state mass of the Sine-Gordon model. They applied the WKB method to the Sine-Gordon model and obtained\nthe soliton-antisoliton bound state mass [3]\n!\nn\u03b3\n8\u03c0\nMn = 2M sin\nn = 1, 2, * * * <\n,\n(1.1)\n16\n\u03b3\nwith\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u03b22\n1\u2212\n\n\u03b22\n8\u03c0\n\n=\n\n8\u03c0\n\u2032 ,\n1 + 2 g\u03c0\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere g \u2032 is the coupling constant with Schwinger's regularization in the massive Thirring model [8]. In order to\nexamine the spectrum of Eq. (1.1), they solved the Bethe-Salpeter equation both in the Sine-Gordon model and in\nthe massive Thirring model, and obtained the bound state mass assuming that the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved\nwith the same regularization as Schwinger's one. This result corresponds to Eq. (1.1) if we expand Eq. (1.1) with\n\u03b3 for n = 1. Furthermore, they concluded that all the bound states with n less than 8\u03c0/\u03b3 are stable, although the\nbound state with n \u2265 3 are imbedded in the continuum state of n = 1 bosons.\nOn the other hand, Fujita and Ogura obtained the bound state mass of the massive Thirring model employing the\ninfinite momentum frame technique (1/K method) [4]. There is only one bound state in this method. They presented\nthe boson mass M (the fermion-antifermion bound state) as,\nM = 2m sin \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 and is determined by\n\"\n#\n1 \u0010\ng\ng \u0011\n1\n1+\n,\n=\n1\u2212\n\u03b8 tan \u03b8\n\u03c0\n4\u03c0\nsin2 \u03b8\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail: hiramoto@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\ne-mail: fffujita@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\n\n1\n\n(1.3)\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fwhere the coupling constant g is Johnson's normalization [9]. Further, Fujita et al. solved the Bethe ansatz equation\nof the massive Thirring model numerically [5,6]. They confirmed that there is only one bound state. They also\ninvestigated the boson-boson scattering states in two-particle two-hole configurations. Further, it is found that all the\nrapidity variables are real. Therefore, they claimed that there is no string solution which satisfies the Bethe ansatz\nequations in two-particle two-hole states.\nRecent calculations of the bound state spectrum for the massive Thirring model have shown that several different\nmethods give different results on the normalization of the coupling constant [10]. This comes mainly from the\nnormalization ambiguity of the coupling constant due to the fermion current regularization in the massive Thirring\nmodel. For the massless Thirring model, Klaiber proved that the coupling constant has a normalization ambiguity\nwhich arises from the fermion current regularization [11]. In the case of the massive Thirring model, it is expected\nthat the same type of the coupling constant ambiguity may appear.\nIn this paper, we calculate the bound state spectrum of the charge zero sector in the massive Thirring model in the\nrest frame which is an opposite limit to the 1/K method. The eigenvalue equation with the q q\u0304 Fock space is solved\nanalytically. It is shown that the spectrum has the same behaviors both for the weak and for the strong coupling\nlimits as those of the other methods, but there still have some differences between the present calculation and other\ncalculations due to the current regularization. In the case of the bound state problem, the regularization procedure\nis highly non trivial, since we have to sum up some types of the diagrams nonperturbatively in order to obtain the\nbound state. Here, we propose somewhat a different way to proceed the regularization. We carry out a regularization\nat the level of the bound state wave function in a consistent fashion. Further, in order to examine the number of\nbound states in the massive Thirring model, we consider the interaction between bosons in the four-fermion Fock\nspace (qq q\u0304 q\u0304). We check analytically that the interaction between q q\u0304 bosons is always repulsive in the qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock space\nand find that there is no excited bound state.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly explain the quantization of the massive Thirring\nmodel. Here, we quantize the fermion field with the free massless fermion basis states. In this basis states, the\nfermion mass is naturally renormalized after we make the Bogoliubov transformation. In Section 3, we obtain the\neigenvalue equation in the q q\u0304 Fock space. In Section 4, we present a regularization scheme of the bound state wave\nfunction. We also discuss some properties of the bound state spectrum of this equation. In section 5, we evaluate the\ninteraction between q q\u0304 bosons of the massive Thirring model in the four-fermion Fock space (qq q\u0304 q\u0304). It is found that\nthe four-fermion Fock space does not produce any bound state. Finally, we summarize in Section 6 what we have\nclarified from the present paper.\nII. THE HAMILTONIAN OF THE MASSIVE THIRRING MODEL\n\nThe massive Thirring model is a (1+1) dimensional field theory which is described by the following Lagrangian\ndensity,\n1\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m0 )\u03c8 \u2212 gj\u03bc j \u03bc .\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nj \u03bc =: \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 :,\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe fermion current j \u03bc is defined by\n\nwhere we choose \u03b3 matrices as\n\u03b30 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u03b31 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b35 =\n\n,\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nIn this representation, the Hamiltonian is given as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202\nH = dx \u2212i\u03c81\u2020 \u03c81 + i\u03c82\u2020 \u03c82 + m0 (\u03c81\u2020 \u03c82 + \u03c82\u2020 \u03c81 ) + 2g\u03c81\u2020 \u03c82\u2020 \u03c82 \u03c81 .\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nNow, we quantize the fermion field in a box L\n1 X\n\u03c8(x) = \u221a\nL n\n\n\u0012\n\nan\nbn\n\n\u0013\n\neipn x ,\n\n(2.5)\n\n{ai , a\u2020j } = {bi , b\u2020j } = \u03b4i,j .\n\n(2.6)\n\n2\n\n\fThen, the Hamiltonian becomes\n\u0015\nX\u0014\n2g\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\npn (an an \u2212 bn bn ) + m0 (an bn + bn an ) + j\u03031,pn j\u03032,\u2212pn ,\nH=\nL\nn\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere currents in the momentum representation j\u03031,pn and j\u03032,pn are given by\nX \u2020\nj\u03031,pn =\nal al+n\n\n(2.8)\n\nl\n\nj\u03032,pn =\n\nX\n\nb\u2020l bl+n .\n\n(2.9)\n\nl\n\nFor the free field theory (g = 0), the Hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation which\nmixes left- and right-handed fermions. On the other hand, this is not possible for interacting cases. However, for the\nmassive Thirring model, we can get reliable results as we consider the bound state spectrum. Now, we introduce new\nfermion operators by a Bogoliubov transformation,\ncn \u2212 d\u2020\u2212n\n\u03b8n\n\u03b8n\n\u221a\n= cos an + sin bn ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u2020\ncn + d\u2212n\n\u03b8n\n\u03b8n\n\u221a\n= \u2212 sin an + cos bn .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nFirst, we consider the free field theory. In this case, the free field Hamiltonian H0 can be written in terms of the new\noperators cn and dn\nXh\n(pn sin \u03b8n + m0 cos \u03b8n ) (c\u2020n cn + d\u2020\u2212n d\u2212n )\nH0 =\nn\n\ni\n+(\u2212pn cos \u03b8n + m0 sin \u03b8n )(c\u2020n d\u2020\u2212n + d\u2212n cn ) .\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe condition that the terms proportional to (c\u2020 d\u2020 + cd) must vanish determines the theta parameter \u03b8n . This is\ngiven as\ntan \u03b8n =\n\npn\n.\nm0\n\nThen, the new free field Hamiltonian H0\u2032 becomes\nXq\nH0\u2032 =\np2n + m20 (c\u2020n cn + d\u2020n dn ).\n\n(2.13)\n\n(2.14)\n\nn\n\nNext, we make a Bogoliubov transformation Eq.

The important\npoint is that the free field Hamiltonian has the bare mass m0 after the Bogoliubov transformation while we have the\nrenormalized mass in Eq. (2.21). We impose the same condition as the free field Hamiltonian. Thus, we obtain\ntan \u03b8n =\n\npn\n,\nm\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhich is just the condition for the free field Hamiltonian except m. Then, H\u03030 is modified as\nX\nH\u03030 =\nEpn (c\u2020n cn + d\u2020n dn ),\n\n(2.23)\n\nn\n\np\nwhere Epn = p2n + m2 .\nThis is all that is necessary to evaluate the bound state spectrum of the massive Thirring model.\nIII. BOUND STATE SPECTRUM WITHIN QQ\u0304 FOCK SPACE\n\nIn order to obtain physical quantities, we have to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. In this case, we have to prepare\nbasis states. Here, we employ the Fock space expansion. We limit the Fock space to q q\u0304 only, since there is no particle\ncreation in the massive Thirring model, and therefore there is no mixture between q q\u0304 and qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock spaces.\nNow, the Fock space for the q q\u0304 state can be written\nX\n|q q\u0304i =\nfn c\u2020n d\u2020\u2212n |0i,\n(3.1)\nn\n\nwhere fn is a wave function in momentum space and satisfies the normalization condition,\neigenvalue of the Hamiltonian with the q q\u0304 Fock space can be written as\nX\ng X \u2020\nM=2\n|fn |2 Epn \u2212\nfl fn (1 + sin \u03b8l sin \u03b8n + cos \u03b8l cos \u03b8n ).\nL\nn\n\nP\n\n|fn |2 = 1. The energy\n(3.2)\n\nl,n\n\nEquivalently, we can write the equation by making variations with respect to fn ,\ng X\nMfn = 2Epn fn \u2212\nfl (1 + sin \u03b8l sin \u03b8n + cos \u03b8l cos \u03b8n ),\nL\nl\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm2\npn pl\ng X\n.\n+\nfl 1 +\n= 2Epn fn \u2212\nL\nEpn Epl\nEpn Epl\nl\n\n4\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\n\fConverting the sum to the integral, we finally obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\npq\nm2\ng\n.\n+\ndqf (q) 1 +\nMf (p) = 2Ep f (p) \u2212\n2\u03c0\nEp Eq\nEp Eq\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis equation is solved analytically, because it is a separable type interaction.\nNow, we solve the integral equation (3.5). Here, we assume that the wave function satisfies the symmetric condition\nf (\u2212p) = f (p). In this case, we can drop the last term of Eq. (3.5). We define the following quantities A and B\nZ \u221e\nA=\ndpf (p),\n(3.6)\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\nf (p)\nB=\ndp\n.\n(3.7)\nEp\n\u2212\u221e\nUsing A and B, we can solve Eq. (3.5) for f (p) and obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng/2\u03c0\nm2\nf (p) =\nA+\nB .\n2Ep \u2212 M\nEp\nPutting this f (p) back into Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7), we obtain the matrix equations\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u039b\nm2\ng\n2dp\nA+\nB ,\nA=\n2\u03c0 0 2Ep \u2212 M\nEp\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nm2\n2dp\ng\nA+\nB .\nB=\n2\u03c0 0 (2Ep \u2212 M)Ep\nEp\n\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nNow,\nthe regularization is necessary for the first equation, since the integral has the divergent term log[\u039b/m +\np\n1 + (\u039b/m)2 ]. This arises from the current-current interaction at the same space-time point. This must be regularized. In the next section, we treat the wave function regularization procedure.\nIV. WAVE FUNCTION REGULARIZATION\n\nThe regularization procedure is well defined for the perturbative treatment. There is no serious problem to renormalize divergent terms in the massive Thirring model. However, if we treat bound state problems, then the regularization\nprocedure is highly nontrivial. This is because we have to sum up some of the diagrams nonperturbatively in order\nto obtain any bound states. For example, Dashen et al. [3] carried out the regularization of the coupling constant\nperturbatively for the bound state. There, they regularize the divergent term by first solving the eigenvalue equation\nand then by adding a new counter term to cancel the divergent part in the energy eigenvalue.\nHere, we propose somewhat a different way to proceed the regularization. We carry out the regularization at\nthe level of wave function in a consistent fashion. The origin of the divergent term comes from the nature of the\ncurrent-current interaction j\u03bc (x)j \u03bc (y) whichp\nhas the divergent at the same space-time point x = y.\nIn our case, the divergent term log[\u039b/m + 1 + (\u039b/m)2 ] arises from the integration of Ep\u22121 . We subtract gA/4\u03c0Ep\nfrom f (p),\ng A\n.\nf \u0304(p) = f (p) \u2212\n2\u03c0 2Ep\n\n(4.1)\n\nIn this case, we obtain\nf \u0304(p) =\n\ng/2\u03c0\n(2Ep \u2212 M)Ep\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nM\n2\n\u0100 + m B\u0304 .\n2\n\nWith this f \u0304(p), we obtain new matrix equations as\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng \u22121 \u03c0\nM\n2\n\u22121 M\n\u0100 =\n\u0100 + m B\u0304 ,\n\u03b1\n+ tan\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\u03b1\n2\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nM\ng 2\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121 M\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\u0100 + m B\u0304 ,\n+ tan\nB\u0304 =\n2\u03c0 M\n2\n2\u03b1\n2m\n2\n5\n\n(4.2)\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\n\fp\nwhere, \u03b1 = m2 \u2212 (M/2)2 . Here, the divergent term is cancelled out. Therefore, the above equations are written by\nthe finite quantities only. The divergent quantities are removed in a very nice and consistent fashion. We note that\nthere are other regularizations for the current-current interaction at the same space-time point. One good example\nof the regularization could be eip\u03b5 (\u03b5 \u2192 0). However, if one wants to apply eip\u03b5 regularization to the bound state\nproblem, one cannot regularize the wave function in a consistent way.\nNow, we obtain the eigenvalue equation,\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u03c0m\nM 2m2\n\u03c0\nM\ng\n\u2212\n= 1.\n(4.5)\n+\n+ tan\u22121\n2\u03c0\n2\u03b1 M\u03b1\n2\n2\u03b1\nM\nIntroducing a new variable \u03b8 by\nM = 2m sin \u03b8,\n\n(4.6)\n\nEq. (4.5) becomes\ng\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0014\u0012\ntan \u03b8 +\n\n1\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n+\u03b8 \u2212\n2\n2 sin \u03b8\n\n\u0015\n\n= 1,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\nNow, we check the strong coupling limit \u03b8 \u223c 0. This corresponds to M = 2m sin \u03b8 \u223c 2m\u03b8. From Eq. (4.7), we get\n\u03b8\u223c\nTherefore, the bound state spectrum becomes\nM\u223c\n\n2 \u0010\ng\u0011\n2\u2212\n.\n3\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(4.8)\n\ng\u0011\n4 \u0010\n2\u2212\nm.\n3\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(4.9)\n\nNamely, M becomes zero for g/\u03c0 = 2. Beyond that, there is no bound state and the theory is not well defined. This is\nprecisely what is predicted by Johnson [9]. This is because we use the massless free fermion basis states. In this case,\nthe coupling constant normalization is bound to use Johnson's normalization as Klaiber shows [11]. This situation\ncan be seen easily in terms of bosonized form of the Thirring model. Since the free fermion current satisfies boson's\ncommutation relations, the bosonized Hamiltonian of the Thirring model can be written as\n\u0010\ni\nX h\u0010\ng \u0011 2 \u2020\ng \u0011 \u2020\n\u03a0 (p)\u03a0(p) + 1 +\np \u03a6 (p)\u03a6(p) ,\n(4.10)\nH=\n1\u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\np\nwhere \u03a6(p) and \u03a0(p) are related to the free fermion current as\nr\nL\n \u0303\nJ0 (p) = j\u03031,p + j\u03032,p = ip\n\u03a6(p)\n\u03c0\nr\nL\n\u03a0(p).\nJ \u03030 (p) = j\u03031,p \u2212 j\u03032,p = \u2212\n\u03c0\n\n(4.11)\n(4.12)\n\nTherefore, we can see that\n\u22122\u2264\n\ng\n\u22642\n\u03c0\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhich is just Johnson's constraint. For the massive Thirring model, we should add the mass term m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 to the\nLagrangian. However, the mass term can be described only by \u03a6(p) without kinetic terms, and therefore it does not\ninfluence the condition that g/\u03c0 should be smaller than 2.\nNext, we consider the weak coupling limit (g/\u03c0 \u223c 0). In this case, we put \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b2 (\u03b2 \u223c 0). Then, we obtain\nthe bound state spectrum\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u03c0 \u0011 g3\n+ O(g 4 ) .\n(4.14)\nM = 2m cos \u03b2 = m 2 \u2212 g 2 + 2 +\n2 \u03c0\nThis result can be compared with the prediction of Fujita and Ogura in the 1/K method calculation\n6\n\n\f\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1 g3\nM = m 2 \u2212 g2 + 4 +\n+ O(g 4 ) .\n4 \u03c0\nOn the other hand, the WKB formula Eq. (1.1) with Johnson's regularization becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng3\nM = m 2 \u2212 g 2 + 3 + O(g 4 ) .\n\u03c0\n\n(4.15)\n\n(4.16)\n\nAs can be seen, the coefficients of g 3 are different from each other. This suggests that each method has nice features\nboth for the weak and for the strong coupling limits, but there still have ambiguities which are related to the currentcurrent regularization.\nIn Fig. 1, we show numerical results of Eq. (4.7), the 1/K method, the WKB method and the Bethe ansatz solution.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 1, the difference between the present calculation and the WKB method is surprisingly small,\nwhile the difference between the present calculation and the 1/K method is not so small. This suggests that the\nregularization may well be related to the total momenta K of q q\u0304.\nV. FOUR-FERMION FOCK SPACE\n\nIn this section, we consider the four-fermion Fock space. To include the four-fermion Fock space, we must be careful\nfor treating transitions from q q\u0304 to qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock space. It is well known that the transition that changes fermion numbers\nis forbidden in the massive Thirring model. This is due to an infinite number of conservation laws that must be\nobeyed by the external momenta [14,15]. Here, we consider the HR term. This contributes to the higher order Fock\nspace\nNow, we calculate the expectation value of HR in the qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock space. The qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock space is defined by\nX\n(5.1)\nf (4) (p1 , p2 ; q1 , q2 )c\u2020p1 c\u2020p2 d\u2020q1 d\u2020q2 |0i\u03b4p1 +p2 +q1 +q2 ,0 ,\n|qq q\u0304 q\u0304i =\np1 p2 q1 q2\n\nwhere f (4) (p1 , p2 ; q1 , q2 ) has an antisymmetric property;\nf (4) (p2 , p1 ; q1 , q2 ) = f (4) (p1 , p2 ; q2 , q1 ) = \u2212f (4) (p1 , p2 ; q1 , q2 ).\n\n(5.2)\n\nER = hqq q\u0304 q\u0304|HR |qq q\u0304 q\u0304i\n8g X\n=\n|f (4) (p1 , p2 ; q1 , q2 )|2 (sin \u03b8p1 cos \u03b8p2 \u2212 cos \u03b8p1 sin \u03b8p2 )2 .\nL ppqq\n\n(5.3)\n\nThus, we obtain\n\n1 2 1 2\n\nNow, we see that ER is always positive. Therefore, this is repulsive and thus there is no bound state in the four\nfermion Fock space. From this calculation, we conclude that there is only one bound state in the massive Thirring\nmodel.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the bound state spectrum in the massive Thirring model. This is based on the q q\u0304 Fock space\nin the rest frame. The eigenvalue equation with the q q\u0304 Fock space is solved analytically. It is shown that the bound\nstate spectrum has right behaviors both for the weak and for the strong coupling limits after the appropriate wave\nfunction regularization. This is indeed confirmed since the q q\u0304 Fock space has no transition to higher Fock space due\nto an infinite number of conservation law. Further, in order to confirm that there is only one bound state, we carry\nout the analytic evaluation of the interaction term in the qq q\u0304 q\u0304 Fock space. We show that the interaction between the\nbosons of q q\u0304 Fock space is repulsive and therefore there is no bound state in the four-fermion Fock space.\nAlthough there are still some differences between the present result and other methods, we can reliably calculate\nthe bound state spectrum after the appropriate wave function regularization. At the present stage, it is not so clear\nwhether the regularization ambiguity of the massive Thirring model can be different from the massless Thirring\nmodel. It may well be that the regularization ambiguity is related to some hidden symmetry which is not yet clearly\nunderstood up to now.\n7\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank K.
