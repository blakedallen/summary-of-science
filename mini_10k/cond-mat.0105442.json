Although in one version or another it has been used to describe numerous physical\nsituations [3], it has proven very difficult for a theoretical analysis, since it inextricably combines the effects of interactions and Anderson localisation. Just like its fermionic cousin the\nmetal\u2013insulator transition [4], the problem of dirty bosons seems to lack a simple analytic\nmean-field theory around which to begin a systematic study. Most of the information on the\ndirty boson quantum phase transitions derive therefore from numerical studies [5], and more\nrecently from an expansion around the lower critical dimension [6].\nIn this paper we will be concerned with a limited class of the dirty boson models at a\ncommensurate filling, and study the limit where the number of bosonic species N is large\n[7]. As is well known in this limit the mean-field theory, or the saddle-point approximation,\nbecomes the exact solution. The quantum mechanical action at T = 0 that defines our\nproblem is\nS [\u03a8] =\n\nZ\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u03bb\nd ~xd\u03c4 (\u2202\u03c4 \u03a8(~x, \u03c4 )) + (\u2207\u03a8(~x, \u03c4 )) + (V (~x) \u2212 \u03bc) \u03a8 (~x, \u03c4 ) + \u03a84 (~x, \u03c4 ) ,\nN\nD\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere \u03a8(~x, \u03c4 ) is a real N-component bosonic field, \u03a82 =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03a82\u03b1 , and V (~x) is a random (in\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nspace) external potential. For simplicity, it will be assumed that V (~x) is uncorrelated, so\nthat hV (x)V (y)i = W \u03b4(x \u2212 y). We will mostly be interested in two dimensions (D = 2),\nbut will leave a general D in the action to comment later on results in other dimensions.\nNote that disorder is assumed to be a random function only of spatial coordinates, while it\nis completely correlated in (i.e. independent of) the imaginary time. This is what makes it\nmuch stronger than in the corresponding problem in classical mechanics. The theory (1) for\nN = 2 describes the superfluid order parameter in the Bose-Hubbard model, at a density\nof bosons commensurate with the lattice [2], [8], also known in literature as the random-rod\nproblem [9]. For N = 3 the theory may be used to describe disordered quantum rotors, i.e.\nthe magnetic quantum phase transitions in the Heisenberg universality class in the presence\nof quenched randomness [10]. When N = 1 the theory describes a random system with the\nIsing symmetry. In general the action (1) provides a minimal description of the quantum\ndisordered interacting system, and for N = \u221e has been studied by renormalisation group\nmethods in the past [11, 12] with conflicting results. The purpose of this paper is to shed\nsome light on the physics implicit in this model, and, in particular, to argue that the model\nallows no superfluid phase in D = 2.\nTo see what is involved in solving the problem in the (spherical) limit N = \u221e, perform\nthe standard Hubbard\u2013Stratonovich transformation on the quartic term and integrate out\nall but one of the bosonic fields. This leaves one with the transformed action:\nSeff [\u03c7, \u03c8] =\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nd ~xd\u03c4\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\nN 2\n\u03c7 (~x, \u03c4 ) + (\u2202\u03c4 \u03a81 (~x, \u03c4 ))2\n4\u03bb\n2\n\n+(\u2207\u03a81 (~x, \u03c4 )) + (V (~x) + \u03c7(~x, \u03c4 ) \u2212\n\n\u03bc) \u03a821 (~x, \u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n)\n\nn\no\n1\n+ (N \u2212 1) ln det \u2212\u2202\u03c42 \u2212 \u22072 + V (~x) + \u03c7(~x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03bc ,\n2\n\nwhich is just the original problem rewritten exactly. Assuming that the Hubbard\u2013Stratonovich\nfield at the saddle-point is independent of imaginary time, \u03c7(~x, \u03c4 ) = \u03c7(~x), and that \u03a81 (~x, \u03c4 ) =\n1\nN 2 c\u03c60 (~x), the saddle-point equations become\n*\n\n1\n\u03c7(~x) = \u03bb ~x, \u03c4\n~x, \u03c4\n2\n2\n\u2212\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u2207 + V (~x) + \u03c7(~x) \u2212 \u03bc\n\u03b50 c = 0,\n\n+\n\n+ c2 \u03c620 (~x),\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1 (~x) are the random eigenstates, and \u03b5\u03b1 the random eigenvalues of the susceptibility\nmatrix\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212\u22072 + V (~x) + \u03c7(~x) \u2212 \u03bc \u03c6\u03b1 (~x) = \u03b5\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 (~x),\n(5)\n\nwith \u03b50 being the lowest eigenvalue. The Eqs. (3)-(5) are completely standard, and the\nonly novelty compared to the case without disorder [13] is the random spectrum instead of\n2\n\n\fthe usual plane waves. In principle, one may expect to have two phases: \u03b50 6= 0 and c = 0,\ncorresponding to the gapped Mott insulator (MI), or \u03b50 = 0 and c 6= 0 which would represent\na superfluid (SF). The gapless insulating Bose-glass (BG) between the MI and the SF [2]\nshould in general be absent, as we argue below.\nWith V (~x) = 0, the solution \u03c7(~x) = \u03c70 is uniform, and the model leads to the wellknown large-N critical behavior in D + 1 dimensions [13]. The correlation length exponent,\nfor example, in the pure case is \u03bd = 1/(D \u2212 1), and in D = 2 the Harris criterion [14] (that\nsays that disorder is irrelevant if \u03bdD > 2) implies that disorder is precisely marginal. When\nV (~x) 6= 0, in the MI phase the saddle-point Eq. (3), after integration over the frequency,\ncan be written in the basis {\u03c6\u03b1 } as:\n\u03c7(~x) = \u03bb\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n|\u03c6\u03b1 (~x)|2\n.\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nThe functions \u03c6\u03b1 are the eigenstates of the screened, but nevertheless random, potential\nV (~x) + \u03c7(~x), and would therefore naively all be expected to be localised in D = 2 [15].\nIn particular, for the localised ground state the first term in the sum in Eq. (6) becomes\nlarge as \u03b50 \u2192 0 precisely in the region of localisation, which by self-consistency implies that\n\u03c7(~x) is also large there. That, on the other hand, then implies \u03b50 is large, and not small as\nassumed, and one runs into a contradiction. Evidently, for the spectrum to extend all the\nway to zero the discrete sum in the last equation must be approximable by an integral, so\nthat the infrared singularity becomes integrable. For this to occur the weight of each of the\nterms corresponding to the low-energy states in Eq. (6) must vanish in the thermodynamic\nlimit as the inverse of the system size, which is tantamount to delocalisation of the lowenergy eigenstates. Put differently, the collapse of the gap must be accompanied by the\nsimultaneous delocalisation of the ground state, so that the gapless phase is necessarily a\nSF. There can be no intermediate localised BG in the model at N = \u221e.\nWith this picture in mind the appearance of the superfluid phase in the large-N model\nin D = 2 appears rather counterintuitive: although screening introduces correlations into\nthe effective random potential, the states should nevertheless always remain localised. In\nthe rest of the paper we first show that although to the lowest order screening does reduce\nthe random potential, it does not make it completely smooth and consequently the MI gap\ncan not close. This conclusion is further corroborated by the numerical solution of the selfconsistent equations on a lattice and absence of the finite-size scaling of the gap and the\nground state participation ratio. In the closing section we compare our result with other\nstudies and speculate on the implications for physical cases N = 1, 2, 3.\n\n2\n\nWeak-disorder expansion\n\nFor a given random configuration the self-consistent equations can not be solved analytically,\nand one has to resort to numerical computations. For weak disorder, however, we can\nexpand the matrix element in (3) in powers of the screened potential. To that end write\n3\n\n\fR\n\n\u03c7(~x) = \u03c70 + \u03c71 (~x), where \u03c71 (~x)dD ~x = 0. The uniform part \u03c70 is just the renormalisation\nof the chemical potential, while Ve (~x) \u2261 V (~x) + \u03c71 (~x) is the screened potential, which should\nvanish with vanishing randomness. Expanding the right hand side of (3) in the MI phase in\nVe (~x) and taking the Fourier transform, we get (for q 6= 0)\nVe (~q) = V (~q) \u2212 \u03bb\u03a0(~q)Ve (~q) + \u03bb\n\u2212\u03bb\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd~kI1 (~k, ~q)Ve (~k)Ve (~q \u2212 ~k)\n\n(7)\n\nd~kd~lI2 (~k, ~l, ~q)Ve (~k)Ve (~l)Ve (~q \u2212 ~k \u2212 ~l) + O(Ve 4 ),\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a0(~q) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd~pd\u03c9G0 (\u03c9, ~p)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~q),\n\n(8)\n\nis the standard polarisation bubble, and\nI1 (~k, ~q) \u2261\nand\n\nI2 (~k, ~l, ~q) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd~pd\u03c9G0 (\u03c9, ~p)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~k)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~q),\n\n(9)\n\nd~pd\u03c9G0 (\u03c9, ~p)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~k)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~k + ~l)G0 (\u03c9, ~p + ~q).\n\n(10)\n\nThe propagator for the clean case is given by G\u22121\np) = \u03c9 2 +p2 +\u03a92 , where \u03a92 \u2261 \u03c70 \u2212\u03bc > 0\n0 (\u03c9, ~\nand is the MI gap.

In\nthe Appendix we compute the above averages in D = 2. Note that although the random\npotential is assumed uncorrelated in space, the screened potential develops correlations and\nf (~\nW\nq) becomes a non-trivial function of the wave-vector. For the low-energy states one\nf (~\nexpects the localisation properties to be determined by W\nq ) at small q~, so we focus on the\nf\nf\nlimit ~q \u2192 0 and denote W (~q \u2192 0) = W .

To the first\nf \u2192 0, which one may be tempted to interpret as a sign\norder in W , one finds that as \u03a9 \u2192 0, W\nof delocalisation of the ground state. This is a consequence of the screening of the random\npotential by the medium, which to the zeroth order in disorder is pure and thus screens\nf /\u03a92 as a dimensionless measure of\nperfectly at q = 0. Also, recognising the combination W\nscreened disorder, to the lowest order Eq. (12) agrees with the Harris criterion: disorder is\nmarginal in D = 2. The fate of disorder is therefore determined by the higher-order terms\nin the expansion. To the second order in disorder we find that\nf \u2192\nW\n\n\u039b2\n2\u03c0 5\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nW\n\u03bb 2 c2\n\n,\n\nas \u03a9 \u2192 0,\n\n(13)\n\ni.e. goes to a non-universal finite constant as the gap decreases. If the bare disorder is\nweak the screened disorder will be even weaker, but always finite. The consequence is that\nthe ground state and the excited states in D = 2 should remain localised [15], so that our\nqualitative argument from the introduction would imply that the gap can not close. This is\nin accordance with the direct numerical solution at strong disorder to which we turn next.\n\n3\n\nNumerical solution\n\nWe begin by introducing a discrete version of our theory where the continuous variable ~x is\nreplaced by a lattice-site index i on a quadratic lattice of linear size L. The kinetic energy\nterm \u22072 is replaced by the nearest-neighbour hopping measured by t, the random potential\nis chosen from a uniform distribution of width W and the interaction strength is given by \u03bb.\nIn our calculations we set W/t = 4 and \u03bb/t = 8, which corresponds to strong disorder and\ninteractions. After the integration over frequency, the self-consistent Eq. (3) becomes\n\u03c7i = \u03bb\n\n|\u03c6\u03b1 (i)|2\n,\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03b1\n\u03b1=1\nN\nX\n\n(14)\n\nin the {\u03c6\u03b1 (i)} basis where these wave functions are now eigenvectors of the matrix\nX\nj\n\n{\u2212tij + (Vi + \u03c7i \u2212 \u03bc) \u03b4i,j } \u03c6\u03b1 (j) = \u03b5\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 (i)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere tij is non-zero for nearest-neighbour i, j only.\nWe solve the set of L\u00d7L equations using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. We gradually\nincrease the chemical potential \u03bc, using the last found solution as the initial guess at the\nnext \u03bc. Finally, we average over many disorder configurations. Of course, for finite L the\ngap is always finite, so to infer the result in the thermodynamic limit we make the standard\nfinite-size scaling ansatz for the average ground state energy\nh\n\n1\n\ni\n\n\u03b50 = L\u2212z F L \u03bd (\u03bc \u2212 \u03bcc ) ,\n5\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere z is the dynamical critical exponent, \u03bd is the correlation length exponent, and \u03bcc is the\ncritical point in the thermodynamic limit; F (x) is a universal scaling function. The values\nof z and \u03bcc are determined by scaling the \u03b50 -axis until all curves cross at a single point. The\nexponent \u03bd is found by scaling the \u03bc-axis so that a reasonable collapse of all the data onto\na single curve is achieved.\nSuch an attempt of finite size scaling of our data is shown in Fig. 3 for systems of linear\nsize L = 6, 8, 10, 12. We display the result for the value z = 0.9, but the picture remains\nqualitatively the same for all 0.5 < z < 1.0. The gap continuously decreases with \u03bc, but the\nfailure of the finite size scaling suggests it does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit.\nWe have also argued that at the point of collapse of the gap, the ground state would\nbe expected to become delocalised. A useful measure of the degree of localisation of the\nwavefunctions at a given energy is provided by the participation ratio\nP (\u03b5) =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b4(\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5)\n\n,\n\n2\n\nL2\n\nL\nX\ni=1\n\n|\u03c6\u03b1 (i)|\n\n(17)\n\n4\n\nwhich is proportional to 1/L2 for the localised states and approaches a constant for the\nextended ones. In the critical region, one expects the participation ratio to assume a similar\nfinite-size scaling form:\nh 1\ni\nP (\u03b50 ) = L\u2212(D\u2212Df ) \u03a6 L \u03bd (\u03bc \u2212 \u03bcc ) ,\n(18)\n\nwhere Df is the fractal dimension of the ground state wavefunction and \u03a6(x) another scaling\nfunction. Our data for the participation ratio are shown in Fig. 4 for the sizes L = 8, 10, 12.\nAgain, attempts to find the common crossing point by tuning Df fail. We see that the\nparticipation ratio of the ground state grows as \u03bc is increased, but conclude that the ground\nstate nevertheless seems to remain localised. This is consistent with the data for the ground\nstate energy.\nOur Newton-Raphson algorithm has difficulties converging as \u03bc is increased and the\nproblem becomes more non-linear. It is possible we simply have not been able to reach the\ncritical point in our numerical calculation. When taken together with the weak-disorder\nexpansion and the physical arguments, however, we believe a more likely interpretation is\nthat there is no SF phase in the model.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, we studied the large-N limit of the commensurate dirty boson theory, and argued that at weak disorder screening does not delocalise the ground state, and consequently,\nthat there is no MI\u2013SF transition in D = 2. Numerical results for the ground state energy\nand the participation ratio that support this conclusion were provided.\nOur conclusion agrees with the results of Kim and Wen [11] who found that disorder\nis always relevant for D \u2265 2 and could not find any stable critical points within their\n6\n\n\frenormalisation scheme. The latter point may in principle be interpreted in three ways: as\na failure of the renormalisation procedure, as that the transition is discontinuous, or that\nthere is no transition. Our findings support the third conclusion. On the other hand, we are\nin disagreement with the recent study of Hastings [12], who considered the closely related\nrandom spherical model, and found the disorder to be marginally irrelevant in D = 2. At\nthe moment we do not fully understand what is the resolution of this disagreement, nor how\nthe ground state becomes extended in Hastings' theory.\nWhile we were mostly concerned with D = 2, the same perturbative procedure can be\nrepeated in D = 3. We found that the same diagram in Fig. 2(e) that led to the finite term\nf in D = 3 vanishes logarithmically as the gap decreases. More importantly, in D = 3\nfor W\nthe Anderson localisation problem allows a mobility edge, so the screened disorder need not\ngo all the way to zero for the ground state to delocalise. We would therefore expect that the\ntheory (1) would have a MI\u2013SF transition in D = 3, as apparently has been found in earlier\nnumerical calculations [16].\nAn important question is what our considerations imply for the physical cases N = 1, 2, 3\nmentioned in the introduction. We believe that in D = 2, for N = 2 the theory (1) does\nhave a transition and which is in the BG\u2013SF universality class. This has been found in\nthe dual theory for the commensurate dirty-bosons [3], in both D = 1 and D = 2, and in\ndetailed numerical calculations [5, 17]. The BG\u2013SF transition is best understood in terms\nof disorder-induced proliferation of topological defects, and thus is very specific to having a\ncomplex (N = 2) order parameter. The same topological mechanism will not apply to the\ncase of a random quantum ferromagnet N = 3, and we conjecture that for N = 3 there may\nnot be a gapless phase in D = 2. On the same grounds, we expect that for the Ising case\nN = 1 the transition again will exist [18].\nFinally, we note the similarity between our problem and the problem of interacting\ndisordered fermions in D = 2 [19]. In the large-N limit the metallic phase in the fermionic\nproblem would correspond to an extended state at the Fermi level, as opposed to the extended\nground state in our problem. Nevertheless, one can show [20] that already to the lowest order\nin disorder, screened disorder remains finite, and thus the state should remain localised. We\nwould therefore expect that the fermionic version of the action (1) also should have only the\nlocalised phase in D = 2, at least in the large-N limit.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis research has been supported by NSERC of Canada and the Research Corporation.\n\n6\n\nAppendix\n\nIn this appendix, we provide the details of the calculations leading up to our main analytic\nresult (12).
