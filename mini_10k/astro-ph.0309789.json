Accumulating evidence points to a binary nature for the\nWolf-Rayet ([WC]) central stars, a group that constitutes about 15% of\nall central stars of planetary nebula. From ISO observations, a dual dust\nchemistry (oxygen- and carbon-rich) has been shown to be almost exclusively associated with [WC] central stars, a fact that could be explained\nby O-rich dust residing in a disk, while the C-rich dust being more widely\ndistributes. HST/STIS space resolved spectroscopy of the [WC10] central\nstar CPD\u201356o 8032, is interpreted as revealing a dust disk or torus around\nthe central star. This, together with CPD\u201356o 8032's variable lightcurve\nis taken as an indirect indication of binarity. Finally, we present here, for\nthe first time, preliminary results from a radial velocity survey of central\nstars. Out of 18 stars with excellent data at least 8 are radial velocity\nvariables. If these turn out to be binaries, it is likely that the central star\nbinary fraction is as high as \u223c50%.\n\n1.\n\nPrologue\n\nWC Wolf-Rayet central stars of planetary nebulae ([WC] central stars of PNe)\nare H-deficient stars that exhibit strong ionic emission lines of helium, carbon\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDe Marco, Barlow, Cohen, Bond & Harmer\n\nand oxygen from their dense stellar winds. Amongst the coolest central stars\nin this group are CPD\u201356o 8032 (the nucleus of the PN He 3-1333) and the\ncentral star of He 2-113 (both classified as [WC10], Crowther et al. 1998).\nCohen et al. (1986) found the mid-infrared KAO spectra of both these objects\nto show very strong unidentified infrared bands (UIBs \u2013 usually attributed to\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). Indeed, both the nebular C/O ratios\n(De Marco, Barlow & Storey 1997) and the ratio of UIB luminosity to total\nIR dust luminosity (Cohen et al. 1989) for these two objects are the largest\nknown. It was therefore a major surprise when mid- and far-IR Infrared Space\nObservatory spectra of these two objects showed the presence of many emission\nfeatures longwards of 20 \u03bcm that could be attributed to crystalline silicate and\nwater ice particles (Barlow 1997, Waters et al. 1998a, Cohen et al. 1999),\nindicating a dual dust chemistry, i.e. the simultaneous presence of both C-rich\ndust and O-rich dust. The dual dust chemistry phenomenon in PNe appears\nto show a strong correlation with the presence of a late WC ([WCL]) nucleus \u2013\nfour out of six [WC8-11] nuclei studied by Cohen et al. (2002) showed similar\ndual dust chemistries. In the context of a single star scenario, this would point\nto a recent transition (within the last \u223c1000 yr) between the O- and the Crich surface chemistries. However, the probability of finding a post-AGB object\nthat had recently changed from an O-rich to a C-rich surface chemistry due\nto a third dredge-up event should be very low indeed. An alternative scenario\nenvisages these systems as binaries (Waters et al. 1998a, Cohen et al. 1999,\n2002), in which the O-rich silicates are trapped in a disk as a result of a past\nmass transfer event, with the C-rich particles being more widely distributed in\nthe nebula as a result of recent ejections of C-rich material by the nucleus.\n\n2.\n\nA Dusty Disk around CPD\u201356o 8032\n\nCPD\u201356o 8032 exhibits a variable optical lightcurve (Pollacco et al. 1992, Jones\net al. 1999), with minima which are \u223c1 mag deep and have a 5-year pseudoperiod (Cohen et al. 2002). This was interpreted by Cohen et al. as precession\nof a dusty disk. We present an updated light-curve for CPD\u201356o 8032 in Fig. 1.\nDe Marco et al. (2002) presented HST/STIS spatially-resolved spectroscopy\nof CPD\u201356o 8032, obtained during its third visual light minimum, which revealed\nthe stellar near UV and blue optical continuum to be split into two spectra\nseparated by about 0.10 arcsec. Once other possibilities were excluded (e.g.,\ninstrumental problems or the presence of two stars), the simpler explanation is\nthat CPD\u201356o 8032's light is seen reflected by the upper and lower rim of a dusty\ndisk or torus seen close to edge-on. If so, CPD\u201356o 8032 could be similar to the\nRed Rectangle (HD44179; Osterbart et al. 1997), whose binary central star light\nis seen indirectly, reflected by the rims of an edge-on disk. In this binary scenario,\nCPD\u201356o 8032's light-curve could also be interpreted as CPD\u201356o 8032's orbital\nmotion taking it in and out of alignment with a denser part of the disk, such\nthat its brightness is modulated in step with the binary period. An alternative\nscenario that is more in line with the asymmetric lightcurve declines, conceives\na dust clump in orbit with the disk passing in front of CPD\u201356o 8032 every 5\nyears. The companion cannot be bright enough to contaminate substantially its\nspectrum, which is reasonably fit with a single Wolf-Rayet model atmosphere (De\n\n\fThe Dual Dust Chemistry - Binarity Connection\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nThe visual lightcurve of CPD\u201356o 8032 between March\n1988 and September 2003.\nMarco & Crowther 1998). CPD\u201356o 8032's putative companion could plausibly\nbe a low mass main sequence star, such as a K dwarf.\nInterestingly, the Red Rectangle, also a binary, is the only system to have a\ndouble dust chemistry and a central star which is not hydrogen-deficient. From\nthis we could suggest that the Red Rectangle's A supergiant central star (the\nother is thought to be an unseen white dwarf [Men'shchikov et al. 2002]) might\nbe on its way to becoming hydrogen deficient.\nThe conjecture that [WC] stars are binary systems is in harmony with the\nfact that binarity is generally known to promote mass-loss. For instance, all the\nmassive Wolf-Rayet stars in the metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud are binaries.\nThis has been explained with the fact that the low metallicity of the SMC leaves\nits stars with atmospheres with relatively low opacities, too low to develop the\ndense Wolf-Rayet winds. Hence the only massive Wolf-Rayet stars possible in\nthe SMC are those where a companion has facilitated mass-loss.\nA direct detection of binarity via radial velocity monitoring (see Section 3),\nis unlikely in the case of [WC] central stars, because of their intrinsically variable\n(e.g. Balick et al. 1996), broad emission lines.\n3.\n\nPreliminary Results of a Central Star Radial Velocity Survey\n\nThere are increasing indications that binary-star processes are intimately related\nto the ejection of many, or possibly even most, PNe. The evidence includes: the\nfact that \u223c10% of PN nuclei are found to be very close binaries (periods of hours\nto a few days; Bond & Livio 1990, Bond 2000) through photometric monitoring;\npopulation-synthesis studies suggesting that these may be just the short-period\ntail of a much larger binary population extending up to orbital periods of several\nmonths (Yungelson et al. 1993, Han et al. 1995); and the prevalence of highly\nnon-spherical morphologies among PNe.\nThe photometric search technique does not work for binaries with periods\nof more than a few days, since it relies on proximity effects. We have therefore\n\n\f4\n\nDe Marco, Barlow, Cohen, Bond & Harmer\n\ncarried out radial-velocity monitoring of a sample of PN nuclei, in order to search\nfor the anticipated population of binaries with periods up to a few months. If\nthey do exist, there will be new implications for the evolution of binary populations, the origin of compact binaries (CVs, SN Ia progenitors), and even the\nquestion of whether single stars can produce visible ionized PNe at all.\nThis program was started in May 2002 at the 3.5-m WIYN telescope. Despite being plagued by very bad weather and some instrument problems, we\nreport that 8 of the 18 central stars for which we have more than five data\npoints have clear radial velocity variability. The independent, but similar program of Pollacco et al. (these proceedings) returned a similar radial velocity\nvariable central star fraction. However, it will take additional observations for\nus to have robust statistics, and to determine orbital periods needed to show\nconclusively that the velocity variations are due to binary motion and not, for\ninstance, to wind variability.\nAcknowledgments.
