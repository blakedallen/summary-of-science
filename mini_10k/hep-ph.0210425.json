Hence, SUSY searches, along with those for the Higgs boson,\nform the focus of physics studies at the current and future colliders. In the simplest version of SUSY models one assumes conservation of a quantum number Rp \u2261 (\u22121)3B+L+2S ,\nwhere S stands for the spin of the particle. The conservation of this quantum number is\nguaranteed only if the superpotential is invariant under the discrete Rp symmetry. However, there really is no deep theoretical reason for this symmetry. As a matter of fact, it is\npossible to have Rp -violating terms in the superpotential while respecting supersymmetry\nas well as invariance under the SM gauge transformation. These are given by\n1\n1\nW6Rp = \u03bbijk Li Lj Ekc + \u03bb\u2032ijk Li Qj Dkc + \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk Uic Djc Dkc + \u03bai Li H2 .\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere Li ,Qi are the doublet lepton, quark superfields, and Ei , Ui , Di the singlet lepton, quark superfields, i being the generation index. The above necessarily mean nonconservation of the baryon number B and/or the lepton number L. The 6 L couplings allow\nthe generation of \u03bd masses in an economical way without introducing any new fields. The\ncontribution from the trilinear \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 comes at the one- or two-loop level and the bilinear\n\u2021\n\nOn leave from Centre for Theoretical Studies, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560 012, India.\ne-mail:rohini.godbole@cern.ch\n\n2\n\n\f\u03bai generate it at tree level [1]. The Kamioka and SNO experiments now give an unambiguious evidence for \u03bd masses. In SUSY models with R/p , there exists enough freedom\nto generate observed mass patterns with sparticle masses in the TeV range, and hence\nwith clean predictions for collider searches. This interplay between indirect constraints,\ncoming from \u03bd physics and the collider signals of R/p SUSY is a very interesting aspect\nof the R/p SUSY studies. Of course the simultaneous existence of the \u03bb\u2032 and \u03bb\u2032\u2032 couplings\nand TeV scale masses for the sfermions will mean a very rapid proton decay. This can\nbe cured by adopting B conservation, i.e. \u03bb\u2032\u2032 = 0. This choice is actually preferred if R/p\nterms are not to wash out baryogenesis. Unified string theories actually prefer models\nwith B conservation and R/p [2]. These models treat the lepton and the quark fields differently and have two discrete symmetries. B conservation and R/p eliminate not just the\ndimension-4 operators for proton decay but also the dimension-5 operators. Needless to\nsay that all this makes R/p theoretically very interesting.\nOf course the large number, 48 as per Eq. (1), of these essentially Yukawa-type\ncouplings, with no theoretical indications about their sizes, is not a very satisfactory\nfeature of R/p SUSY. Luckily many of these unknown couplings are constrained by low\nenergy processes such as p/\u03bc decay, \u03bd masses or cosmological arguments like generating\nthe right amount of baryon asymmetry in the early Universe. There exist a host of\nconstraints on R/p couplings [3]. Most of the constraints come from virtual effects caused\nby sparticles in loops and some from direct collider searches. Many of these get less\nsevere with increasing number of the third-generation indices of the involved couplings.\nThe constraints on the 6 L couplings coming from \u03bd masses can be particularly severe but\nmay also depend on model assumptions. Hence a study of the same couplings in a collider\nenvironment, can certainly help to clarify model building.\n\nRp violation at the colliders\nEffects of R/p at colliders fall into qualitatively different classes, depending on the size of the\nR/p couplings. The one effect that is always present is an unstable lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP), which need not even be the \u03c7\u030301 . If at least one of the R/p , \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 couplings\nis > 10\u22126, the LSP will decay in the detector. In our work we consider the case of these\n6 L , R/p couplings and take the \u03c7\u030301 to be the LSP. The decays of the LSP \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u03041 f2 can\ngive rise to strikingly different final states [4] as compared to the SUSY signal with Rp\nconservation. For masses of \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 of interest at the LHC and NLC, even a t in the final\nstate will be allowed. For larger R/p couplings, decays of particles and sparticles other\nthan the LSP via R/p interactions [5, 6, 7] can take place. For example, t\u0303 \u2192 bl, t \u2192\nb \u0303l. These then may compete with the Rp -conserving decays. The R/p couplings can\nalso give contributions to tree level processes due to virtual sparticle exchange, such as\npp \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 [8, 7] or pp(pp\u0304) \u2192 tt\u0304X. In the last case the interference terms give rise to\nnon-vanishing t polarization [9], which can be probed by the decay lepton energy/angular\ndistribution [10]. In addition, for large enough R/p couplings, one also has resonant or nonresonant production of a single sparticle via the R/p couplings [11, 12, 13]. For example,\n3\n\n\fmuch as H \u2212 produced via tb\u0304H \u2212 coupling, one can also have pp \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4\u0303 via \u03bb\u2032333 as shown\nin Figure 1. A few points are worth noting. The production cross-section is appreciable\n\nt\nH\u2212\nb\n\nt\nH\u2212\nb\nFigure 1: The different 2 \u2192 3 subprocesses contributing to H + /\u03c4\u0303 .\neven, for mt\u0303 > mt and for \u03bb\u2032333 as small as 0.05. \u03c4\u0303 so produced will have both R/p and\nRp -conserving decays. The latter will produce \u03c7\u030301 , which will further decay through some\nR/p coupling. Some of these decays can fake the charged Higgs signal. This can be seen\nin a little more detail as follows. For large \u03bb\u2032333 , \u03c4\u0303 \u2032 s can have the Rp conserving decays,\n/p decay\n\u03c4\u0303 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c7\u030301 and \u03c4\u0303 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 for mt > m\u03c4\u0303 , whereas for mt < m\u03c4\u0303 , it can also have the R\n\u03c4\u0303 \u2192 bt\u0304. The net final state produced will then be decided by relative branching ratios of\n\u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303+\n/p couplings and its decay via the\n1 into different channels. Production of \u03c4\u0303 through R\nsame will give rise to pp \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4\u0303 X \u2192 tb\u0304tb\u0304X. Note that this is the same final state as the\nH \u00b1 . A comprehensive study of the H + signal at the LHC, in this case, will thus require\nfull analysis of the three-body decays of the \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 . The Rp -conserving decays of the \u03c4\u0303\n0\nfollowed by the R/p decays of the \u03c7\u03031 from the \u03c4\u0303 decay can also produce\npp \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4\u0303 X \u2192 (2t)(2b)(2\u03c4 )X\n\u2192 tb (2b\u0304) \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 X,\n\n(2)\n\netc. These will then give rise to the characteristic 6 L signal of like-sign fermion pairs.\nAs mentioned already, of particular importance are the possibilities of testing the low\nenergy constraints, in 'direct' signals at the colliders. Since the third generation sfermions\nare expected to be lighter, they may give rise to larger virtual effects. For \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303+\n1 with\nmasses of interest at the LHC, NLC, final states with third-generation fermions including\nt are possible. One needs a study of the R/p decays of \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 retaining effects of the mass\nof the third-generation fermions, for 6 L coupling.\nWe therefore calculated three-body R/p decays of the \u03c7\u030301 with dominant \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 couplings involving at least two third-generation indices. We kept the mass effects of the\nthird-generation fermions and the sfermion L\u2013R mixing terms complex and analysed\n4\n\n\fbL(R)\n\nbR\nb\u0303\n\nL(R)\n\n\u03c7\u030301\n\nbL\n\nbL\n\nbR\n\nbR(L)\nL\n\nb\u0303\nR(L)\n\nL\n\n\u03bd\u03c4L\n\n\u03c7\u030301\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\nR\n\nL\n\n(\u03bd\u03c4L)\n\nc\n\u03c7\u030301\n\n\u03bd\u03c4 L\n\nFigure 2: Diagrams contributing to the three body decay \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 .\nnumerically for cases with unified/ununified gaugino masses, including the effect of subdominant \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 .\n\nThree-body decays of the \u03c7\u030301\nIn this section we present the results for the above-mentioned case of dominant \u03bb\u2032333\ncoupling. The calculation and the results can be trivially generalized [3] to cases of other\ncouplings, dominant or subdominant. Figure 2 shows the diagrams contributing to the\nthree-body decay \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 . If m\u03c7\u030301 > mt , then the decay into a massive final state\ncontaining t, viz. \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 b\u0304t\u03bd\u03c4 + C.C., is also possible. Our expressions for the decay\nwidths [3] are the most general in that they include the effect of the finite fermion masses\nand are applicable to the case of complex L\u2013R mass term. In the limit of real L\u2013R\nsfermion mass terms, these agree with the earlier calculations [14] with finite fermion\nmass and, in the limit of zero fermion mass, they agree with those of Refs. [15, 16] up to\nthe corrections pointed out in Ref. [14].\nThe decay widths clearly depend on the L\u2013R mixing in the sfermion sector as well\nas on the composition of the \u03c7\u030301 . For example, for a Wino-like \u03c7\u030301 , in the absence of\nL\u2013R mixing, the second diagram with a b\u0303R exchange will not contribute. A substantial\ngaugino/higgsino mixing causes the width into the massive mode to be large at low tan \u03b2,\nwhereas for large tan \u03b2 it is the massless mode that gets enhanced, compared to the\ncorresponding widths for unmixed cases.\nAs an illustration, the results for the \u03c7\u030301 widths into massive and massless modes,\nfor \u03bb\u2032333 = 1 and M\u03c7 \u03030 = 600 GeV, are presented in Figure 3 as a function of m\u2217 , the\n1\nsquark mass scale. We use two different choices of L\u2013R mixing in the squark sector and\ndifferent compositions of the \u03c7\u030301 . The massive decay mode has a large width for low tan \u03b2\nand large higgsino\u2013gaugino mixing. Otherwise the massless mode is larger, although the\nmassive mode is non-negligible. From the left panel we see that, for a \u03c7 \u030301 \u223c W\u0303 , the widths\nare enhanced by an order of magnitude with respect to the case of a \u03c7\u030301 \u223c B\u0303. The right\npanel shows that with moderate L\u2013R squark mixing, even for a \u03c7\u030301 \u223c W\u0303 , the b\u0303-mediated\ndiagram contributes to the massive mode. Further the figures also show that smaller t \u03031 , b \u03031 ,\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Left panel shows \u03c7\u030301 widths for no L\u2013R squark mixing and the right one for\nmoderate mixing. Dashed and solid lines are for a Wino-like and Bino-like \u03c7\u030301 respectively.\nIn case of non-zero mixing, At \u2212 \u03bc cot \u03b2 = 150 GeV, Ab \u2212 \u03bc tan \u03b2 = 2000 GeV. m\u2217 is a\nsquark mass scale.\nmasses enhance the width for the massive mode for a B\u0303-like \u03c7\u030301 . For the same reasons the\nwidths into the massive and massless final state also depend on the value of tan \u03b2.\nFigure 4 shows the bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , tb\u0304\u03bd decay widths, as a function of the squark mass scale m\u2217 .\nThe massive mode dominates at lower tan \u03b2 and the massless one for the higher values.\nThus, to summarize, we find that with \u03bb\u2032333 dominant, the massive decay has a large width\nfor low tan \u03b2 and large higgsino\u2013gaugino mixing. Otherwise the width for the massless\nmode is larger, though that for massive mode is also non-negligible. All the plots have\nbeen shown for \u03bb\u2032333 = 1. In the resonant sfermion region one finds very little dependence\nof the width on \u03bb\u2032333 and otherwise the widths for other values of the couplings simply\n\u20322\nscale down like \u03bb333\n.\nThe analysis can be easily generalized to the case where there are more than one\nlarge R/p couplings, and the results are shown in Figure 5. We notice that the widths into\ndifferent final states are not too dissimilar, and more importantly the branching ratio into\na final state with t is not too small.\n\nConclusions\nIt is important to have a collider probe of the R/p \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 couplings with more than one\nthird-generation index. Further, single charged slepton production via the R/p coupling\n\u03bb\u2032i33 can produce final states, which can be confused with the H \u00b1 signal. Even for smaller\nbut dominant R/p \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 couplings with more than one third-generation index, the\nthree-body R/p decays of \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c7\u0303+\n1 can have important phenomenological consequences for\nnew particle searches at the future colliders. If the \u03c7\u030301 is 'Wino'-like, its decay widths\nincrease by over an order of magnitude. If the \u03c7\u030301 is lighter than the t, its R/p decays will\nbe dominantly into massless fermions: bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 for dominant \u03bb\u2032333 coupling, cb\u0304\u03c4, sb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 and the\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Solid lines show the \u03c7\u030301 decay width for the bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 channel and dashed lines for\nthe tb\u0304\u03bd channel. The left panel is for tan \u03b2 = 3 with the trilinear soft term being 350 GeV\nwhereas in the right panel tan \u03b2 = 30 and the trilinear soft term is 150 GeV. mB\u0303 , slepton\nmass and \u03bc are all taken to be 600 GeV.\n\nFigure 5: Left panel shows the decay widths of \u03c7\u030301 for \u03bb'333 = 0.5, \u03bb233 = 0.2 for various\nfinal states as indicated in the figure. The right panel shows branching ratios for the\nsame. These are for no L\u2013R mixing, \u03bc = 500 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 3 and mB\u0303 = 500 GeV.\ncharge conjugate modes c\u0304b\u03c4\u0304 , s\u0304b\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 for dominant \u03bb\u2032323 , and for \u03bb233 into \u03bc\u0304\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4\u0304 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . For\na \u03c7\u030301 heavier than the t, the massive decay modes can become competitive for large L\u2013R\nsfermion mass term and/or for substantial mixing in the higgsino/gaugino sector, at not\ntoo large tan \u03b2. All the R/p decays of the \u03c7\u030301 produce final states with like-sign dileptons\nas the tell-tale signature of the 6 L , as long as the final state t decays hadronically.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank my collaborators F.
