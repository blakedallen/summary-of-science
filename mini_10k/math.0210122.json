It is shown that in many such cases, at enhanced\nsymmetry points in moduli a braid group acts on the derived category of sheaves\nof the variety. This braid group covers the Weyl group of the enhanced symmetry\nalgebra, which itself acts on the deformation space of the variety in a compatible\nfashion. Extensions of this result are given for nontrivial B-fields on K3 surfaces,\nexplaining physical restrictions on the B-field, as well as for elliptic fibrations. The\npresent point of view also gives new evidence for the enhanced gauge symmetry\ncontent in the case of a local A2n -configuration in a threefold having global Z/2\nmonodromy.\n\nIntroduction\nThe phenomenon that Type II string theory compactified on a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold\ncan exhibit enhanced gauge symmetry was first observed in the physics literature in the\ncontext of K3 surfaces [23], [1]. The existence of non-perturbatively enhanced symmetry\nalgebras is forced by the duality between heterotic string theory on T 4 and the Type\nIIA string on K3, since the former obviously has enhanced symmetry at special points\nin moduli. It was found that a K3 surface can have enhanced gauge symmetry if it has\nrational double point (ADE) singularities, and the type of the (simply-laced) non-abelian\nLie algebra that appears precisely matches that of the singularity. The argument for nonabelian gauge symmetry was later extended to Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds in [2] and [16], for\nthreefolds with a curve of ADE singularities. In the presence of monodromy, non-simply\nlaced Lie algebras can also appear. These symmetries and the arising representations\nhave also been analyzed in the context of M- and F-theory (see [13], [3] and references\ntherein).\nThe purpose of the present paper is to give a mathematical interpretation of a \"holomorphic shadow\" of this symmetry. Namely, of the parameters needed to specify a string\nvacuum, I will only concentrate on the complex structure and B-field parameters, ignoring\nthe K\u00e4hler structure. In particular, by moving in the K\u00e4hler moduli space, I can resolve\nthe singularities mentioned in the previous paragraph, and work with smooth K3 surfaces and Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds, containing ADE configurations of rational curves and\nconfigurations of ruled surfaces respectively. The phenomenon that I will illustrate by\nseveral theorems is that enhanced gauge symmetry can occur at points in complex moduli when the derived category of the corresponding Calabi\u2013Yau manifold has a large set\nof autoequivalences. Moreover, these derived equivalences always satisfy the relations of\na generalized braid group, which covers the Weyl group of the enhanced gauge symmetry\nLie algebra. When one deforms the complex parameters, these autoequivalences deform\naway to equivalences of derived categories between different manifolds; this is always governed by a Weyl group action on the deformation space. In particular, one can phrase the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nresults of this paper as saying that the category of topological D-branes on a Calabi\u2013Yau\ncompactification (cf. [8]) has an extra braid group worth of symmetries at enhanced gauge\nsymmetry points, not present at generic points in moduli.\nBraid group actions for groups of Type A (and DE) on derived categories were first\nconstructed in [19]. In Section 3 of the present paper I will show how to extend these\nactions in two dimensions (K3 surfaces) to cover deformations, and how this fits into\nthe framework of enhanced gauge symmetry. The autoequivalences will be generalized to\ncover deformations with nonzero B-field; in particular I will derive the restrictions on the\nB-field found in [1] by a duality argument.\nCalabi\u2013Yau threefolds, as mentioned before, can exhibit gauge symmetries of all A . . . G2\ntypes. Corresponding braid group actions are constructed in [22]. I explain in Section 4 the\nmain points of the construction, refering back to the (easier) surface case. I also give some\nexamples, including an amusing projective example exhibiting non-trivial monodromy,\nand make some comments related to the interpretation of the actions as enhanced gauge\nsymmetry.\nThe threefolds appearing in this paper represent the simplest case of enhanced gauge\nsymmetry, that of \"uniform singularities\" or geometrically ruled surfaces (no hypermultiplets in physics-speak). In case there are extra rational curves in fibers, the mathematics\nis more complicated (compare for example [13]); dissident curves can be flopped, there\nare many more autoequivalences and derived equivalences around, and it appears to be\ndifficult to formulate a clean statement. However, for one highly singular situation studied for example in [3, Section 4], the ideas of the present paper are strong enough to\nprovide supporting evidence (though alas not a proof) for the gauge symmetry content.\nThe argument is spelled out in Remark 4.5.\nThe paper begins with two introductory sections: Section 1 recalls reflection groups\nand (generalized) braid groups, whereas Section 2 deals with (families of) equivalences of\nderived categories. The latter section contains a statement which may be of independent\ninterest, connecting deformations of a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor of a Calabi\u2013Yau variety\nwith its action on cohomology. Section 5 points out an extension of the results to elliptic\nfibrations and braid groups of affine type which may be interesting from the point of\nview of F-theory, whereas Section 6 poses a challenge for symplectic geometry via mirror\nsymmetry.\n\n1. Reflection groups and generalized braid groups\nA Dynkin diagram \u2206 in this paper means an irreducible finite type diagram corresponding to a finite root system \u03a3 \u2282 hR in a real Euclidean inner product space hR . It is\nwell known that such diagrams can be of type An , Bn , Cn , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 or G2 . The\nroot system \u03a3 defines a finite reflection group W\u2206 = hri i acting on hR , generated by a set\nof reflections r1 , . . . , rn indexed by nodes of \u2206, equivalently by a set of simple roots. As\nan abstract group,\nD\nE.D\nE\nri2 = 1, (ri rj )mij = 1\nW\u2206 \u223c\n= ri : i \u2208 Nodes(\u2206)\nwith one relation for every node i and one for every pair of different nodes (i, j) with\nlabel mij . The group W\u2206 also acts on the complex vector space h = hR \u2297 C.\n\n\f3\n\nDefine the (generalized) braid group (also called Artin group) B\u2206 by generators and\nrelations as\nD\nE.D\nE\n(1)\nB\u2206 = Ri : i \u2208 Nodes(\u2206)\nRi Rj . . . = Rj Ri . . .\n| {z } | {z }\nmij\n\nmij\n\nwith one relation for every pair of different nodes (i, j) of \u2206, the braid relation. There is\na group homomorphism B\u2206 \u2192 W\u2206 sending Ri to ri . As an example, in the familiar case\nof type An the group W\u2206 is the symmetric group on (n + 1) letters, whereas B\u2206 is the\nclassical braid group on (n + 1) strings.\n2. Families of derived equivalences\nIf X is a smooth projective variety, let D b (X) denote the bounded derived category\nof coherent sheaves on X. A kernel (derived correspondence) between smooth projective\nvarieties X1 , X2 is an object U \u2208 D b (X1 \u00d7 X2 ). Such an object defines a functor\n\u03a8U : D b (X2 ) \u2192 D b (X1 )\nby\nL\n\n\u03a8U (\u2212) = Rp1\u2217 (U \u2297 p\u22172 (\u2212)),\nwith pi : X1 \u00d7 X2 \u2192 Xi the projections. If \u03a8U is an equivalence of triangulated categories,\nthen it is called a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor and U is said to be invertible.\nSuppose that \u03c0 : X \u2192 S is a smooth family of projective varieties over a complex\nbase S. A relative kernel is a pair (U, \u03c6), where\n\u2022 \u03c6 : S \u2192 S is an analytic automorphism, giving rise to the fibre product diagram\nX \u00d7\uf8e6\u03c6 X \u2212\u2192 X\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c0\ny\ny\nX\n\n\u03c6\u25e6\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u2192 S\n\nand\n\u2022 U \u2208 D b (X \u00d7\u03c6 X ) is an object in the derived category of the product.\nThere is a map X \u00d7\u03c6 X \u2192 S with fibre Xs \u00d7 X\u03c6(s) over s \u2208 S. The (derived) restriction\nof U to this fibre gives a kernel\nUs = Lys\u2217 (U) \u2208 D b (Xs \u00d7 X\u03c6(s) )\nwhere ys : Xs \u00d7 X\u03c6(s) \u0592\u2192 X \u00d7\u03c6 X is the inclusion. Hence a relative kernel defines a family\nof functors\n\u03a8s = \u03a8Us : D b (X\u03c6(s) ) \u2192 D b (Xs ).\nIn the present paper, a relative kernel (U, \u03c6) will be called invertible, if for all s \u2208 S the\nfunctor \u03a8s is a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor. Let Auteq(X , S) be the group of invertible relative\nkernels up to isomorphism, the group of relative equivalences of the family X \u2192 S. By\nconstruction, every element of the group Auteq(X , S) gives a family of Fourier\u2013Mukai\ntransforms over the base S.\nThe next statement is in some sense auxiliary, but it encompasses the point of view of\nthe present article. Let X be a projective K3 surface or Calabi\u2013Yau threefold. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192\nS be a family of projective deformations of X over a polydisc S, with \u03c0 \u22121 (0) \u223c\n= X\nfor 0 \u2208 S. Assume that the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map\n\u03c8 : T0 S \u2192 H 1 (X, \u0398X )\n\n\f4\n\nof the family is injective.\nLet U0 \u2208 D b (X \u00d7 X) be an invertible kernel on X giving rise to a Fourier\u2013Mukai\nfunctor \u03a8 = \u03a8U0 on X. Using the Mukai map from the derived category to cohomology\n(see for example [7, Section 3.1]), there is an induced isomorphism\n\u03c8 : H \u2217 (X, C) \u2192 H \u2217 (X, C)\npreserving Hodge structures (in the sense of Mukai for the K3 case). In particular, H n,0 is\npreserved where n is the dimension of X; so if \u03a9 \u2208 H 0 (X, \u03a9nX ) is a holomorphic top-form\nthen its image \u03c8(\u03a9) is also a holomorphic top-form (a constant multiple of \u03a9).\nTheorem 2.1. Assume that there is an invertible relative kernel (U, \u03c6) on X \u2192 S\nwith \u03c6(0) = 0 extending U0 . Then there is a commutative diagram\nd\u03c6|0\n\nT0\uf8e6\n(S)\n\u2212\u2192\nT0\uf8e6\n(S)\n\uf8e6\u03c8\n\uf8e6\u03c8\ny\ny\n1\n1\nH (X,\nH (X,\n\uf8e6 \u0398X )\n\uf8e6 \u0398X )\n\uf8e6\u2227\u03c8(\u03a9)\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\u2227\u03a9\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n1\n1\nH (X,\uf8e6\u03a9X )\nH (X,\uf8e6\u03a9X\n)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\nH \u2217 (X, C)\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nH \u2217 (X, C)\n\nwhere the last vertical maps are the inclusions coming from Hodge theory.\nThis statement make look complicated, but it says something very simple. Suppose\nyou have a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor \u03a8 on X. The action of \u03a8 on cohomology gives rise, via\nHodge theory, to a map on the base of the local deformation space of X. Then the only\nway to extend \u03a8 over a deformation family of X is to a relative kernel whose action \u03c6 on\nthe base is compatible with the map defined by \u03a8. In particular, unless \u03a8 acts trivially on\nthe local deformation space, it will never extend to a family of autoequivalences (\u03c6 = idS )\nin a family of deformations of X.\nProof of Theorem 2.1 Once the statement is properly formulated, the proof is\nnot very difficult. Note that the family \u03a8Us of Fourier\u2013Mukai functors gives rise to an\nisomorphism of local systems \u2295n Rn (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c0)\u2217 (CX ) \u223c\n= \u2295n Rn \u03c0\u2217 (CX ) on S (basically just a\ncontinuous family of cohomology isomorphisms), which preserves Hodge filtrations. Now\nuse the fact that the period map of the family is injective (since the Kodaira\u2013Spencer\nmap of \u03c0 is, and X is Calabi\u2013Yau), and unwind the definition of the derivative of the\nperiod map at 0 \u2208 S.\n\u0003\n3. K3 surfaces with ADE configurations\nLet \u0232 be a projective K3 surface with a du Val (rational double point) singularity at a\npoint p \u2208 \u0232 and no other singularities. Let g : Y \u2192 \u0232 be its smooth K3 resolution with\nexceptional locus E = E1 \u222a . . . \u222a Er . It is well known that each component Ei is a smooth\nrational curve of self-intersection \u22122, hence it defines a reflection\n(2)\n\nri : \u03c9 7\u2192 \u03c9 + (Ei * \u03c9) Ei\n\non H 2 (Y, C). The intersection graph of the curves {Ei } is a Dynkin diagram \u2206 of\ntype ADE, and as the notation suggests, the maps rj generate an action of the reflection\ngroup W\u2206 on H 2 (Y, C).\n\n\f5\n\nProposition 3.1. There exists a family e : Y \u2192 Z of projective deformations of e\u22121 (0) \u223c\n=\nY over a complex polydisc 0 \u2208 Z, with an action of the finite group W\u2206 on the base Z,\nsuch that the following properties hold:\n(i) there is a proper subset Zi \u2282 Z such that s \u2208 Zi if and only if the fibre Ys contains\na smooth rational curve which is a deformation of Ei \u2208 Y ;\n(ii) for every s \u2208 Z, there is a contraction morphism Ys \u2192 \u0232i,s , which contracts the\ndeformation of Ei in Ys if s \u2208 Zi and is an isomorphism otherwise;\n(iii) the fixed locus of ri on Z equals Zi ; and\n(iv) for w \u2208 W\u2206 and s \u2208 Z, the fibres Ys , Yw(s) are isomorphic.\nProof This can be proved using the language of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces [10]. Let M\nbe the orthogonal complement of hE1 , . . . , En i in the Picard group of Y , or any sublattice\nthereof containing the cohomology class of an ample divisor on Y ; since \u0232 was assumed\nprojective, such M exist. Consider the local moduli space Y \u2192 Z of M-polarized K3\nsurfaces [10] with central fibre Y = e\u22121 (0) for 0 \u2208 Z, a smooth family of projective\nK3 surfaces. Since Z is small, the second cohomology H 2 (Ys , Z) can be identified across\nthe family. The base Z is isomorphic, using the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map, to a small disc\naround the origin in N \u2297 C, where N is the orthogonal complement of M in Pic (Y ).\nSince M does not include the class Ei , Ei \u2208 H 2 (Ys , Z) is algebraic (and represented by\na rational curve) if and only if s \u2208 Zi for a subvariety Zi \u2282 Z. It is easy to see that\nthe W\u2206 -action on H 2 (Y, C) preserves N \u2297 C, and hence W\u2206 can be made act on Z.\nThe isomorphisms Ys \u223c\n= Yw(s) come from the Torelli theorem, since these surfaces have\nisomorphic Hodge structure. Finally the fact that Zi is exactly the fixed locus of ri is just\nchasing definitions.\n\u0003\nNext I want to define relative kernels on Y \u2192 Z, indexed by nodes of the diagram \u2206. By\n(ii) above, for a node i of \u2206 and s \u2208 Z there is a contraction Ys \u2192 \u0232i,s which contracts Ei\nif s \u2208 Zi and is an isomorphism otherwise. There is a diagram\nYei,s\n\u0582\n\u0581\nYs\nYri (s)\n\u0581\n\u0582\n\u0232i,s\nwhere Yei,s is the fibre product of the two contractions. This fibre product can be thought\nof as a subscheme of the product Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) ; it is the \"correspondence variety\" on the\nproduct (pairs of points mapping to the same image). If s \u2208 Z \\ Zi , then Yei,s is simply\nthe diagonal in Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) with respect to the isomorphism Ys \u223c\n= Yri (s) . On the other\nhand, if s \u2208 Zi , then Ei \u2282 Ys is a rational curve, and Yei,s has two components: one is the\ndiagonal, and the other one is Ei \u00d7 Ei \u223c\n= P1 \u00d7 P1 . The components intersect along the\ndiagonal \u2206Ei .\nIn any case, set Ui,s = OYei,s \u2208 D b (Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) ) to be the (pushforward of the) structure\nsheaf of this correspondence subscheme. It is possible to show (see [22, Theorem 4.1] for\nthe case of threefolds) that the kernels Ui,s are restrictions to the fibres of a relative kernel\n(Ui , ri ) on Y \u2192 Z.\nTheorem 3.2. For every node i of \u2206, the relative kernel (Ui , ri ) is invertible: for s \u2208 Z,\nthe kernel Ui,s defines a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8i,s = \u03a8Ui,s : D b (Yri(s) ) \u2212\u2192 D b (Ys )\n\n\f6\n\nsuch that for a pair of nodes (i, j) of \u2206, there is a isomorphism of functors\n(3)\n\u03a8i,s \u25e6 \u03a8j,ri(s) \u25e6 . . . \u223c\n= \u03a8j,s \u25e6 \u03a8i,rj (s) \u25e6 . . . : D b (Yrij (s) ) \u2212\u2192 D b (Ys )\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\nmij\n\nwhere\n\nmij\n\nrij = ri \u25e6 rj \u25e6 . . . \u223c\n= rj \u25e6 ri \u25e6 . . . \u2208 W\u2206 .\n| {z } | {z }\nmij\n\nmij\n\nHence the derived category D b (Y ) carries an action of the braid group B\u2206 , and this action\ndeforms to an action of B\u2206 by a family of derived equivalences over the deformation\nspace Y \u2192 Z of Y .\nProof The point s = 0 \u2208 Z is fixed by all ri , and in this case the theorem is a restatement of a special case of [19, Theorem 1.2]. In more detail, as proved in [22, Lemma\n4.6], for s = 0 \u2208 Z the functors \u03a8i,0 are just the twist functors of [19] with respect to\nthe spherical sheaves OEi (\u22121) on Y = Y0 . The relations (3) were proved in [19]. Hence\nmapping the braid group generator Ri to the autoequivalence \u03a8i,0 defines an action of B\u2206\non D b (Y ).\nFor arbitrary s \u2208 Z, the fact that \u03a8i,s is invertible is easy: if s \u2208 Zi then it is still a\ntwist functor; otherwise it is the structure sheaf of the diagonal in Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) under the\nisomorphism Ys \u223c\n= Yri (s) , and hence clearly invertible. The relation (3) can be proved\nusing the method of [22], which does the more complicated case of threefolds. The point\nis that the kernels for the composites on both sides of the relation (3) can be proved to\nbe structure sheaves; for a general point s \u2208 Z they are both isomorphic to the structure\nsheaf of the diagonal in Ys \u00d7 Yrij (s) under the isomorphism Ys \u223c\n= Yrij (s) , and from this\na specialization argument concludes that the two kernels are isomorphic everywhere. In\nparticular, this gives an independent proof in this case of the braid relations on the central\nfibre Y .\n\u0003\nIt is known from [1] that (for appropriate values of the K\u00e4hler form) Type II string\ntheory on the surface Y exhibits enhanced gauge symmetry. The braid group action in\nTheorem 3.2 is a holomorphic shadow of this enhanced gauge symmetry: the derived\ncategory of Y has a braid group worth of autoequivalences covering the Weyl group of the\nnonperturbative gauge symmetry algebra, which deform to equivalences between different\nvarieties under a deformation of its complex structure. In other words, at the enhanced\ngauge symmetry points the derived automorphism group of Y (the group of symmetries\nof the category of topological D-branes) is larger than that of its deformations.\nI next extend Theorem 3.2 and its interpretation as enhanced gauge symmetry to gerby\ndeformations, also known as nonzero B-fields. I take the most simple-minded definition,\naccording to which the B-field is a class B \u2208 H 2 (Y, R/Z). A B-field can be used to twist\nthe derived category of coherent sheaves of the K3 surface Y as follows. Consider the\nnatural map\n(4)\n\n\u2217\n\u03b4 : H 2 (Y, R/Z) \u2192 H 2 (Y, OX\n)\n\n\u2217\ncoming from the exponential sequence. The class \u03b2 = \u03b4(B) \u2208 H 2 (Y, OX\n) gives a \"gerbe\"\non X, and there is a notion of a sheaf over this gerbe (also called \u03b2-twisted sheaf on Y ).\nOne wants to define the \"derived category of \u03b2-twisted sheaves on Y \" with some finiteness\ncondition. If the class B is torsion in H 2 (Y, R/Z), then the usual notion of coherence\ngeneralizes, and one obtains [7] a triangulated category D b (Y, B) with properties very\nsimilar to those of D b (Y ). In the general case there does not seem to be an accepted\n\n\f7\n\ndefinition, though see [14, Remark 2.6] for discussion. The following statement is therefore\nformulated for the case of torsion B-fields; I certainly expect it to hold in general.\nTheorem 3.3. Let B \u2208 H 2 (Y, Q/Z) be a torsion B-field. Then for every vertex i of \u2206,\nthere is a family of twisted Fourier\u2013Mukai functors\n(5)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8i,s,B : D b (Yri (s) , ri (B)) \u2212\u2192 D b (Ys , B)\n\ndeforming the functor \u03a8i,s,0 = \u03a8i,s . Here W\u2206 acts on on H 2 (Y, R/Z) via its action\non H 2 (Y, R).\nProof Let p1 , p2 denote the projections of Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) onto its factors. A twisted functor (5) needs, by [7, Section 3.1], a kernel\nVi,s \u2208 D b (Ys \u00d7 Yri(s) , p\u22172 (ri (B)) \u2212 p\u22171 (B))\n(note that I am using additive notation for classes in cohomology with values in Q/Z).\nRecall the correspondence variety Yei,s in Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) with respect to the i-th contraction.\nThe sheaf Ui,s was defined as the structure sheaf of this correspondence; more precisely,\nif k : Yei,s \u0592\u2192 Ys \u00d7 Yri(s) is the inclusion, then Ui,s = k\u2217 OYei,s .\nLet\ne = p\u22172 (ri (B)) \u2212 p\u22171 (B).\nB\nNote that by [7, Theorem 2.2.6], there is a twisted pushforward functor\ne \u2192 D b (Ys \u00d7 Yr (s) , B).\ne\nk\u2217 : D b (Yei,s , k \u2217 (B))\ni\n\nI claim that the structure sheaf of the scheme Yei,s is naturally a sheaf on Yei,s over the gerbe\ne This implies that the kernel Ui,s = k\u2217 O e can be thought of\ndefined by the class k \u2217 (B).\nYi,s\ne\nas a sheaf on Ys \u00d7 Yri (s) over the gerbe corresponding to B and hence it can be used to\ndefine the twisted functor (5).\nTo prove the claim, I distinguish two cases. First assume s \u2208 Zi . Then Ei deforms\nto Ys and as I said above, Yei,s has two components: one is Ei \u00d7 Ei and the other one\nis \u2206Ys , the diagonal. It is enough to show that the structure sheaf of either component\ne restricted to that component. But one\nis a sheaf over the gerbe coming from k \u2217 (B)\ncomponent Ei \u00d7 Ei is simply the quadric surface, which has a trivial Brauer group and\ne \u2206 = (B * Ei )Ei . Now\nhence there is nothing to prove. On the other component, k \u2217 (B)|\nYs\ne \u2206\nthe point is that since s \u2208 Zi , Ei is an algebraic class on Ys , hence the class k \u2217 (B)|\nYs\ndefines the trivial gerbe (see Remark 3.4 for the argument). Hence again, the structure\nsheaf is a sheaf over this gerbe!\nNext assume that s \u2208 Z \\Zi . Then there is an isomorphism Ys \u223c\n= Yri (s) . It can be shown\nthat this isomorphism induces the map ri on second cohomology. On the other hand, Yei,s\ne pulls back to the\nis in this case irreducible and isomorphic to the diagonal; moreover, B\ntrivial gerbe over this diagonal. Hence the structure sheaf is again a sheaf over the gerbe\ne\ndefined by k \u2217 (B).\nThe fact that the kernel Ui,s defines an equivalence of categories can be proved using [7,\nTheorem 3.2.1], which generalizes the criterion of Bridgeland [5, Theorems 5.1 and 5.4];\nI omit the details.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. The statement of Theorem 3.3 involves a subtlety concerning the W\u2206 action on gerbes. On the central fibre Y , all cohomology classes Ei are algebraic. On the\n\n\f8\n\nother hand, the map H 2 (Y, R) \u2192 H 2 (Y, OY\u2217 ) factors through H 2 (Y, OY ) and by Hodge\ntheory, the image of Ei \u2208 H 2 (Y, R) in H 2 (Y, OY ) is zero. This implies that B and ri (B)\ngive the same gerbe on Y . However, for generic Ys the classes Ei are transcendental,\nand B, ri (B) are different gerbes. In fact, Theorem 3.3 should be complemented by a\nstatement that there is no family of equivalences\nD b (Yri (s) , B) \u2192 D b (Ys , B).\nThe family of sheaves {Ui,s } is certainly not appropriate, since as the proof above shows,\ne gives a nontrivial gerbe for s \u2208 Z \\ Zi exactly because the class [Ei ] is transcendental\nB\non Ys . Indeed I expect that the only possible way to deform the equivalence \u03a8i,s in\nthe B-field direction is that compatible with its cohomology action; in other words, there\nis an analogue of Theorem 2.1 for gerby deformations. I have no idea how to prove this\nstatement.\nI wish to offer the following interpretation of Theorem 3.3: Type II string theory\non (Y, B) has enhanced gauge symmetry (for appropriate values of the K\u00e4hler parameter)\nif and only if the derived category D b (Y, B) admits a set of twisted autoequivalences,\nwhich deform to twisted Fourier\u2013Mukai functors between different points in moduli when\nthe complex structure and B-field parameters are deformed. Theorem 3.3, together with\nRemark 3.4, says that this is the case if and only if ri (B) = B for all i, in other words if\nand only if Ei * B = 0 for all exceptional curves. Note that this condition on the B-field\nis identical to that of [1, p. 4], found by an analysis involving heterotic/Type II duality.\n4. Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds containing ruled surfaces\nLet X\u0304 be a projective threefold with a curve of singularities\nB = Sing(X) \u0592\u2192 X\u0304,\nsuch that along the curve X\u0304 has du Val singularities of uniform ADE type. The iterated\nblowup of the singular locus f : X \u2192 X\u0304 is a resolution of singularities. Locally over\na point p \u2208 B \u2208 X\u0304, the fibre of f is a set of rational curves as before, intersecting\naccording to the appropriate ADE type Dynkin diagram. However, globally there may\nbe monodromy (see Figure 1): as p moves over the curve B, the configuration of curves\nmay be permuted according to a diagram symmetry of the Dynkin diagram.\nIt is well known that quotients of ADE Dynkin diagrams by (subgroups of) their automorphism groups are non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams in a well-defined sense. Concretely, the action of Z/2 on the diagrams A2n+1 , Dn and E6 gives, respectively, the\ndiagrams Cn+1 , Bn\u22121 and F4 , whereas the action of Z/3 and the symmetric group on\nthree letters leads to the diagram G2 . The group Z/2 also acts on the diagram A2n ; this\nis a special case which I exclude from consideration, though see Remark 4.5 below.\nGlobally therefore, the exceptional locus of f : X \u2192 X\u0304 consists of a set of smooth\ngeometrically ruled surfaces {\u03c0j : Dj \u2192 Bj } intersecting in a Dynkin configuration \u2206,\nwhich may or may not be simply laced. If \u2206 is simply laced then each Bj is isomorphic\nto B, whereas in the general case each Bj is an umramified cover of B of the appropriate\ndegree.\nAs in the case of surfaces, I want to describe some deformations of the threefold X.\nIn the local case (when one restricts attention to a neighbourhood of the exceptional\nsurfaces), this problem is studied in detail in [22, Section 2]. Globally there may be some\nobstructions to realizing all local deformations as actual projective deformations of X. In\n\n\f9\n\nA2\n\nA3\n\nD4\n\nD4\n\nA2\n\nC2\n\nB3\n\nG2\n\nFigure 1. Dynkin diagrams and configurations of surfaces\nsimple cases (see below) it can be checked that the deformations I describe actually exist.\nThe next proposition therefore should be considered a kind of \"ideal scenario\" statement.\nProposition 4.1. Let X be the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold constructed above, with a set of\nexceptional surfaces {\u03c0j : Dj \u2192 Bj } indexed by nodes of a Dynkin configuration \u2206, which\nmay or may not be simply laced. Assume that X has good deformation theory. Then the\nuniversal family of (projective Calabi\u2013Yau) deformations e : X \u2192 S of X = e\u22121 (0) over a\npolydisc 0 \u2208 S carries an action of the reflection group W\u2206 on its base S; moreover, the\nfollowing properties hold.\n(i) For every s \u2208 S, there is a contraction fs : Xs \u2192 X\u0304s deforming the contraction f .\n(ii) There is an analytic subset Sj \u2282 S of codimension equal to the genus of Bj , such\nthat s \u2208 Sj if and only if the fibre Xs contains a smooth ruled surface in the\nexceptional locus of fs which is a deformation of Di \u2208 X.\n(iii) The fixed locus of rj on S equals Sj .\n(iv) For w \u2208 W\u2206 and s \u2208 S, the fibres Xs , Xw(s) are birational.\nAssume moreover that the genus g of B is at least one, and s \u2208 S is a general point in\nthe base. Then\n(iv) the exceptional locus of Xs \u2192 X\u0304s consists of rational (\u22121, \u22121)-curves, coming in\nsets of (2g \u2212 2) naturally indexed by positive roots of \u2206.\n(v) For w \u2208 W\u2206 and s \u2208 S, the birational map Xs 99K Xw(s) flops some of these\ncurves.\nNote that in the central fibre, the exceptional locus of fs consists of a set of surfaces\nindexed by simple roots (nodes) of \u2206. In the general fibre (assuming genus at least two),\n\n\f10\n\nthe exceptional set of fs is a set of curves indexed by positive roots of \u2206. Figure 2\nillustrates the case \u2206 = A2 , g = 2.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1+\u03b2\nXs\nX\n\n[\u03b1 + \u03b2]\n\n\u03b2\n\n[\u03b1]\n[\u03b1]\n\n[\u03b2]\n\n[\u03b2]\n\ns\nS2\n\n0\nS1\nS\n\nFigure 2. The root system of A2 and exceptional loci for g = 2\nNote also that the deformation theory of X is very different if the genus of B is zero.\nIn that case, the W\u2206 -action is trivial (Sj = S for all j and hence every generator fixes S)\nand the exceptional locus is always two-dimensional. For higher genus the W\u2206 -action\nis non-trivial and the general exceptional locus is one-dimensional. The case g = 1 is\nalso somewhat special: in that case, for general s \u2208 S, the contraction fs : Xs \u2192 X\u0304s is\nan isomorphism, which is reminiscent of the surface case. This distinction is discussed\nfurther below.\nThe next statement is the exact analogue of Theorem 3.2.\nTheorem 4.2. For every node j of \u2206, there is a family of Fourier\u2013Mukai functors\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8j,s : D b (Xrj (s) ) \u2212\u2192 D b (Xs )\nsuch that for a pair of nodes (i, j) of \u2206, there is a isomorphism of functors\n(6)\n\u03a8i,s \u25e6 \u03a8j,ri(s) \u25e6 . . . \u223c\n= \u03a8j,s \u25e6 \u03a8i,rj (s) \u25e6 . . . : D b (Yrij (s) ) \u2212\u2192 D b (Ys )\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\nmij\n\nwhere\n\nmij\n\nrij = ri \u25e6 rj \u25e6 . . . \u223c\n= rj \u25e6 ri \u25e6 . . . \u2208 W\u2206 .\n| {z } | {z }\nmij\n\nmij\n\n\f11\n\nHence the derived category D b (X) carries an action of the braid group B\u2206 , and this action\ndeforms to an action of B\u2206 by a family of equivalences over the deformation space X \u2192 S\nof X.\nProof The proof, given in detail in [22, Section 4], is similar to that of Theorem 3.2.\nThe individual functors Uj,s are defined using a diagram\nXs\n\nXrj (s)\n\n99K\n\u0581\n\n\u0582\nX\u0304s .\n\nFor s \u2208 Si , the functor turns out to be a special case of a functor written down by Horja\nin [11, (4.31)], and proved invertible in [12]. The proof of the braid relations relies, as\nbefore, on a specialization argument.\n\u0003\nAccording to [2], [16], [3] and references cited in these works, threefolds X of the\nabove type (for suitable values of the K\u00e4hler form) exhibit enhanced gauge symmetry.\nTheorem 4.2 is a holomorphic shadow of this symmetry: the derived category of X has\na braid group worth of autoequivalences covering the Weyl group of the gauge algebra,\nwhich for genus at least one deforms away to a set of equivalences between different\ndeformations. In particular, the derived automorphism group of X is larger than generic\nat these enhanced symmetry points.\nIt is interesting to consider the case when the curve B has genus zero. In this case,\nthe projective threefold X has no deformations where the surfaces deform away. The\nbraid group still acts on the derived category of X, but it also acts as a set of derived\nautoequivalences on all deformations. Hence nothing gets \"enhanced\". This phenomenon\nwas also observed in the physics literature: as explained in [16, p.2], enhanced gauge\nsymmetry needs that B is not rational; if B \u223c\n= P1 then the symmetry is only present in\nthe limit when the area of B goes to infinity [2]. The lack of deformations is also an issue\nin the proof of the braid relations in [22]; the proof proceeds via decomposing X locally\ninto a union of two pieces X1 \u222a X2 , so that both contain ruled surfaces over the affine line\nA1 and have enough deformations. Decomposing P1 into a union of two lines is here the\nmathematics equivalent to taking the area of the P1 to infinity.\nExamples 4.3. Varieties X\u0304 with a curve of singularities of uniform type An can be found\namong hypersurfaces or complete intersections in weighted projectice spaces; compare\nfor example [16]. The resolution X is then embedded in a (partial) resolution of the\nambient space, typically with n distinct divisors over the relevant singular locus; hence\nthe configuration in X is still of type An . It can often be shown by concrete methods that\nthe deformation theory of these threefolds is good in the sense needed for Proposition 4.1\nto hold. Such varieties can be systematically searched for and in low codimension classified\nusing the graded ring method pioneered by Reid; see the A1 case in [20] and the general\ncase in [6].\nJust for amusement, I proceed to give an example of a projective Calabi\u2013Yau threefold X which contains a C2 configuration of surfaces, inspired by [3, Section 3]; to the best\nof my knowledge, this is the first explicit example of this kind. Begin with an auxiliary\nvariety\n\u001a\n\u001b\nx42 = y1 y2\nV\u0304 =\n\u2282 P5 [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4].\nx81 + x82 + y14 + y24 + y34 + z 2 = 0\n\n\f12\n\nV\u0304 is a degenerate degree (4, 8) complete intersection Calabi\u2013Yau threefold in the indicated\nspace. It can be checked by explicit computation that V\u0304 has three curves of singularities,\nwhich are all elliptic. Along two of the curves at {x1 = x2 = y1 = 0} and {x1 = x2 = y2 =\n0}, V\u0304 has generically A1 singulariries; this is a result of the identifications on the weighted\nprojective space. For a generic (4, 8) complete intersection (which is simply an octic in\nP4 [1, 1, 2, 2, 2], since the degree four variable can be eliminated), there is one irreducible\ncurve of A1 singularities, but in the special V\u0304 this part of the singular locus becomes\nreducible because of the first equation. The last curve is {x2 = y1 = y2 = 0}, arising also\nbecause of the first equation; the singularity along the last curve is generically A3 . The\nthree curves all meet at the two points (0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : \u00b1i) of the weighted projective\nspace. A patient calculation shows that these points are also quotient singularities, under\nthe group Z/2 \u00d7 Z/4 acting on C3 by (\u22121, \u22121, 1) \u00d7 (1, i, \u2212i).\nConstruct a particular crepant partial resolution V \u2192 V\u0304 in two steps. First perform the\nblowup of both intersection points according to the right hand arrow of the toric diagram\nFigure 3. This introduces two exceptional divisors over the two points, and leaves behind\nthree disjoint curves of singulatities of uniform type A1 , A1 and A3 respectively, with no\ndissident points. Then blow up the two disjoint A1 curves to get a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold V\nwith a single elliptic curve of uniform A3 singularities.\n\nFigure 3. The toric partial resolution of C3 /(Z/2 \u00d7 Z/4)\nConsider the action\n\u03b9 : (x1 : x2 : y1 : y2 : y3 : z) 7\u2192 (x1 : (\u2212x2 ) : y2 : y1 : (\u2212y3 ) : (\u2212z))\non the weighted projective space. This action fixes V\u0304 ; since it interchanges the two A1\nsingular curves, it extends to the partial resolution V . Further, \u03b9 acts by a free action\non the elliptic curve of A3 sigularities of V ; in the transverse coordinates x2 , y1 , y2 to this\ncurve satisfying the relation x42 = y1 y2 , the action interchanges y1 and y2 , and maps x2\nto \u2212x2 . A final check shows that \u03b9 acts freely on V\u0304 and hence on V . Thus letting\nX\u0304 = V /h\u03b9i,\nthe projective Calabi\u2013Yau threefold X\u0304 has an elliptic curve of A3 singularities and is\nsmooth otherwise; moreover, the local coordinates along this curve undergo Z/2 monodromy. Hence its Calabi\u2013Yau resolution X \u2192 X\u0304 contains a C2 configuration of exceptional surfaces ruled over elliptic curves.\nRemark 4.4. The braid group action on the derived category gives rise to actions on even\nand odd cohomology, using the Mukai map. The action on odd cohomology H 3 (X, C)\nleads, as discussed in Proposition 2.1, to a Weyl group action on the tangent space to the\ndeformation space, in a compatible fashion with the way the derived equivalences deform.\nThere is also an induced Weyl group action on the Picard group. Some of these actions\nwere described before; eg. [16] has a symmetric group action in the case of Type A, both\non the Picard group and the deformation space. The action of the braid group on the\nderived category explains all these actions in a uniform way.\n\n\f13\n\nRemark 4.5. The case of monodromy Z/2 acting on the Dynkin diagram A2n has been\nexcluded from consideration all along. This case has caused considerable headache also in\nthe physics literature [3, Section 4]. In this case, the exceptional divisors Di of f : X \u2192 X\u0304\nare still indexed by vertices of a kind of quotient quiver, the An -quiver with a marked\nvertex at one end corresponding to the adjacent Z/2-orbit of vertices of A2n . However,\nthe marked node corresponds to a singular exceptional surface. It is an irreducible nonnormal surface \u03c0n : Dn \u2192 B whose double locus is a section and whose fibre over any\npoint b \u2208 B is a line pair. I do not know whether there exists an autoequivalence \u03a8n\nof D b (X) corresponding to this surface, but I suspect that the answer is yes; this is a\ncontracting EZ-configuration in the sense of Horja [12], with singular E.\n\nA4\n\n(A2 , )\n\nFigure 4. The A4 configuration with Z/2 monodromy\nThe Main Assertion of [3, Section 4], supported by various arguments including the\nanalysis of the matter spectrum, claims that the enhanced gauge symmetry is sp(n), or\nin the language of the present paper, of type Cn . The point of view exposed in this paper\ngives additional support to this claim. Namely, the derived category of D b (X) is acted\non by the autoequivalences \u03a81 , . . . , \u03a8n\u22121 coming from the smooth ruled surfaces, as well\nas the hypothetical autoequivalence \u03a8n ; the question is what are the relations. One can\nmake an educated guess based on the following argument.\nIn the singular threefold B \u2282 X\u0304, take a small quasiprojective surface \u0232 \u2282 X\u0304 intersecting B once transversally. Let Y \u2192 \u0232 be its resolution in X, with exceptional\ncurves E1 , . . . , E2n \u2282 Y . Set Ei = OEi (\u22121) \u2208 D b (Y ) for i = 1, . . . , 2n. The functors \u03a8i\ncan be restricted to Fourier\u2013Mukai functors on Y (compare [22, Proof of Theorem 4.5]).\nThe functor \u03a8i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121 restricts in fact to the composite of two twist functors TEi\nand TE2n+1\u2212i . On the other hand, by [19], the twist functors {TEi : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n} generate\nthe braid group BA2n acting on the derived category of Y . Moreover, the monodromy Z/2\nacts on this braid group, mapping TEi 7\u2192 TE2n+1\u2212i for i = 1, . . . , n. The guess I want to\nmake is that the functors \u03a81 , . . . , \u03a8n satisfy the relations of the fixed subgroup (BA2n )Z/2 .\nBy a result in algebra [17], this fixed subgroup is generated by the composites TEi \u25e6TE2n+1\u2212i\n(note these commute) for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and a final element TEn \u25e6 TEn+1 \u25e6 TEn (note these\nbraid), and the group generated by these elements is the braid group corresponding to\nthe Weyl group (WA2n )Z/2 . This latter group can be checked by a direct argument to be\nisomorphic to the Weyl group of the diagram Cn .\n\n\f14\n\nHence the conjectural answer is that X has a set of derived equivalences \u03a81 , . . . , \u03a8n\nsatisfying the braid relations of the Dynkin diagram Cn . In other words, X has enhanced\ngauge symmetry of type Cn (or sp(n)).\nRemark 4.6. To conclude this section, I remark that as opposed to the case of dimension\ntwo, the braid group actions of [19] can never be interpreted as enhanced gauge symmetry in dimension three. The reason is the following: it can easily be checked that if E\nis a spherical object in the sense of [19], then the corresponding twist functor acts on\ncohomology by \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03b1 + hch(E), \u03b1ich(E), where h, i is a linear combination of intersection\nforms on cohomology. However, ch(E) only has even components, hence the action of\nthe twist functor on odd cohomology and so on H 1 (X, \u0398X ) is trivial. In particular, by\nTheorem 2.1, a twist functor always deforms to all deformations as an autoequivalence in\ndimension three, and hence it can never be part of an \"enhanced\" action.\n5. Elliptic fibrations and braid groups of affine type\nLet \u03c3 : X \u2192 S be an elliptic fibration of a projective threefold X. Assume that there\nis a smooth component C \u2282 S of the discriminant locus of \u03c3, over which the fibres\nof \u03c3 are of uniform Kodaira type In with n > 2, In\u22c6 , II \u2217 , III \u2217 or IV \u2217 . These are the\nen\u22121 (n > 2), D\ne n+4 , E\ne6 , E\ne7 and E\ne8 .\nfibre types corresponding to the affine diagrams A\nIn X, the rational curves in the fibres over p \u2208 C undergo monodromy, and trace out\nen\u22121 case the monodromy is not\nruled surfaces \u03c0j : Dj \u2192 Cj . Assume that in the type A\ne 4 case it does not act transitively on the outer vertices. Then\ntransitive, and in the type D\nthe global intersections of the exceptional surfaces are described by an affine Dynkin\ne which is the original A\neD\neE\ne diagram for trivial monodromy and a quotient\ndiagram \u2206,\neC\neG\neFe type diagram otherwise. The diagram \u2206\ne gives rise to a braid\nnon-simply laced B\ne and one (braid) relation for every pair\ngroup B\u2206e , with one generator for every node of \u2206\ne\nof nodes as dictated by the labels of the diagram \u2206.\n\ne4\nA\n\ne3\nC\n\nFigure 5. Some ruled surface configurations in elliptic fibrations\nTheorem 5.1. The braid group B\u2206e of affine type acts on the derived category D b (X).\n\n\f15\n\nProof The ruled surfaces Dj \u2192 Cj give rise to Fourier\u2013Mukai functors \u03a8j on X as\nbefore. The proof of a single braid relation only concerns two surfaces and the functors\ndefined by them. Under the assumptions made, every pair of surfaces forms an A1 \u00d7\nA1 , B2 or G2 configuration. Moreover, the computation of the composed functors can be\nrestricted to a small neighbourhood of these two surfaces. Hence the proof of [22] applies.\n\u0003\nEnhanced gauge symmetry for threefolds with elliptic fibrations has been discussed in\nthe context of F-theory compactifications; see [18], [3], [9] and references therein.\n6. Mirror symplectomorphisms?\nThe paper [19], a direct predecessor of the present work, is directly motivated by mirror\nsymmetry. Namely, the original motivation of that paper was to find the mirrors of certain\nsymplectomorphisms of symplectic manifolds (M 2n , \u03c9), Dehn twists in Lagrangian spheres\nS n \u2282 M. The twist functors in spherical objects are natural candidates for the mirrors\nof Dehn twists.\nAs discussed in [11], [21] and [4], the derived equivalences studied in this paper, arising\nfrom ruled surfaces collapsing to curves in X, are mirror to certain diffeomorphisms of\nthe mirror manifold, arising as monodromy transformations around certain boundary\ncomponents of the complex moduli space of the mirror M. These diffeomorphisms are\nsymplectomorphisms of (M 2n , \u03c9) for special values of the symplectic form \u03c9. It would be\nof interest to find a direct symplectic geometric construction of these diffeomorphisms.\nIt is tempting to speculate that they are given by some kind of twisting with respect\nto a fibered submanifold of M, just as the Fourier\u2013Mukai functors of X are constructed\nfrom the ruled surfaces. [15] begins the topological study of the mirrors of some explicit\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifolds X containing a single ruled surface; the situation appears to be\nquite intricate. It would also be interesting to see whether in appropriate cases the braid\nrelations (1) can be proved for these symplectomorphisms.\nReferences\n[1] P.S.
