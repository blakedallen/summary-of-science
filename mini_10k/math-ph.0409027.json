We compute the\nscattering amplitudes explicitly and we find that the masses of particles\nin the obtained theory are determined by the mass spectrum of D.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLocal and relativistic quantum fields can be obtained via analytic continuation\nfrom Euclidean random fields. From the 80-ies on, this concept, which proved to\nbe useful especially for scalar fields in the space-time dimension d = 2, was applied in a number of articles (see e.g. [4] and references therein) to random vector\nfields obtained as solutions of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)\nDA = \u03b7, where D is a complex, quaternionic or octonionic Cauchy-Riemann\n1\n\n\fdifferential operator and \u03b7 a non Gaussian noise with values in the fields of\ncomplex numbers, quaternions or octonions, respectively. For the quaternionic\ncase (space-time dimension d = 4) we have recently been able to prove that the\nassociated quantum gauge fields have non-trivial scattering behaviour [3].\nIn the paper [5], the equation DA = \u03b7 was studied systematically in d\ndimensional space-time and spin dimension L (of \u03b7). Let \u03c4 : SO(d) \u2192 Gl(L)\nbe a representation s.t. \u03b7 transforms covariantly under the representation of\nthe Euclidean group induced by \u03c4 , i.e. \u03c4 (\u039b)\u03b7(\u039b\u22121 (x \u2212 y)) = \u03b7(x) in probability\nlaw \u2200\u039b \u2208 SO(d) and y \u2208 Rd . Let D be a differential operator covariant w.r.t.\nthe representation \u03c4 , i.e. \u03c4 (\u039b)Dx \u03c4 (\u039b\u22121 ) = D\u039bx \u2200\u039b \u2208 SO(d). Furthermore we\nassume that D is translation invariant, i.e. has constant coefficients. In this\ncase, for the Fourier transformed Green's function D\u0302\u22121 (k) of D the following\nrepresentation was obtained in [5]:\nD\u0302\u22121 (k) = QN\n\nQE (k)\n\nl=1 (|k|\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n+ m2l )\u03bdl\n\nwith ml \u2208 C, mj 6= ml for l 6= j and \u03bdl \u2208 N. QE (k) is an L \u00d7 L-matrix with\nP\npolynomial entries of order \u2264 \u03ba = 2( N\nl=1 \u03bdl \u2212 1) which fulfills the Euclidean\n\u22121\ntransformation law \u03c4 (\u039b)QE (k)\u03c4 (\u039b ) = QE (\u039bk)\u2200\u039b \u2208 SO(d). Without loss\nof generality we assume that QE is prime w.r.t the factors (|k|2 \u2212 m2l ), i.e.\nthat none of them divides all of the polynomial matrix elements of QE . If one\nimposes a \"positive mass spectrum\" condition ml > 0 for l = 1, . . . , N it follows\nimmediately that D is invertible on the space of (CL -valued) distributions over\nRd and we can therefore solve the above SPDE by setting A = D\u22121 \u2217 \u03b7.\nThe Schwinger functions (moments) associated to A can be calculated exlicitly as\n\n=\n\nSn,\u03b11 ***\u03b1n (x1 , . . . , xn ) = E [A\u03b11 (x1 ) * * * A\u03b1n (xn )]\nZ Y\nl\nY\n\u03b2j1 ***\u03b2jl\nC\nD\u03b2\u22121\n(xjr \u2212 x) dx\njr \u03b1jr\n\nX\n\nI\u2208P (n) {j1 ,...,jl }\u2208I\n\n(2)\n\nRd r=1\n\n|\n\nT\n=Sn,\u03b1\nj\n\n{z\n\n***\u03b1j (xj1 ,...,xjl )\n1\nl\n\n}\n\nwhere P (n) is the collection of all partitions of {1, . . . , n} into disjoint subsets\nand C \u03b2j1 ***\u03b2jl are constants depending on the law of \u03b7. We have also used the\nEinstein convention of summation on repeated upper and lower greek indices\nw.r.t. an arbitrary invariant metric on the spin-space.\nIn this paper we study the analytic continuation of the truncated Schwinger\nfunctions SnT to truncated relativistic Wightman functions WnT and the scattering behaviour of these Wightman functions. The paper is organized as follows:\nIn Section 2 we explicitly compute the Fourier transformed truncated Wightman functions of the model. This will be done combining techniques of [1] and\n[5]. In Section 3 we discuss the scattering behaviour of the truncated Wightman\nfunctions, showing that it is nontrivial, if and only if \u03bdl = 1 for l = 1, . . . , N . In\nthis case we derive explicit formulae for the truncated scattering amplitudes.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAnalytic continuaton of the Schwinger functions\n\nIn this section we obtain a representation of the truncated Schwinger functions\nSnT as Fourier-Laplace transforms, i.e.\nT\nT\n)(x1 , . . . , xn ) =\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) = L(\u0174n,\u03b1\nSn,\u03b1\n1 ***\u03b1n\n1 ***\u03b1n\nZ\nn\nX\nT\n(2\u03c0)\u2212dn/2\n(k1 , . . . , kl ) dk1 * * * dkn ,(3)\nexp(\n\u2212kl0 x0l + i~kl * ~xl ) \u0174n,\u03b1\n1 ***\u03b1n\nRdn\n\nl=1\n\nT\nis a tempered distribution which fulfils the spectral property,\nwhere \u0174n\u03b1\n1 ***\u03b1n\nPj\ni.e. it has support in the cone {(k1 , . . . , kn ) \u2208 Rdn : qj = l=1 kl \u2208 V\u03040\u2212 , j =\n\u2212\n1, . . . , n \u2212 1}, and x01 < . . . < x0n . Here, V\u03040 stands for the closed backward\nlightcone (that we do not use the forward lightcone for the formulation of the\nspectral condition is a matter of convention on the Fourier transform). Under\nthis condition the above integral exists in the sense of tempered distributions.\nIf such a representation exists, it follows from the general theory of quantum\nfields that SnT is the analytic continuation of the inverse Fourier transform\nWnT = F \u22121 (\u0174nT ) of \u0174nT from points with purely relativistically real time to\nthe Euclidean points of purely imaginary time. Furthermore, it follows from the\nsymmetry and Euclidean covariance of the SnT that WnT fulfills the requirements\nof Poincar\u00e9 covariance and locality, see e.g. [9].\nIn order to obtain such a representation, we apply the formula for the expansion of an inverse polynomial into partial fractions on the inverse of the\ndenominator of Eq.

The statement for\n\n4\n\n\f\u03c1 = 1 is just the statement of Proposition 7.8 in [1]. Note that (\u2212\u2206+m2 )\u2212j (x) =\n(\u22121) d\n2 \u2212(j\u22121)\n(x) holds in the sense of tempered distributions.

The rest of the theorem follows\nfrom [9] (for the cluster property, see the proof of Theorem 7.10 of [1])\nBy considerations similar to those proving the temperedness of the \u0174nT one\ncan also show that the sequence of tempered distributions fulfills the sufficient\nHilbert space structure condition on truncated Wightman functions introduced\nin [2]. Therefore, the sequence of Wightman functions are the vacuum expectation values of some quantum field theory in indefinite metric [2, 8].\n\n3\n\nCriteria for the existence of a scattering limit\nand calculation of the scattering amplitudes\n\nIn this section we replace the two point function \u01742T given in Theorem 1 by\nPN\nT\n\u2212\n(k1 )\u03b4(k1 + k2 ),\na two point function \u0174 \u2032 2 (k1 , k2 ) = QM,2 (k1 , k2 ) s=1 \u03bbs \u03b4m\ns\n0 6= \u03bbs \u2208 R which clearly has the same covariance properties as \u01742T . The reason\nT\nfor this is that in any \u01742T there occur terms \u01742,(m\nwith ml1 = ml2\nl1 ,j1 )(ml2 ,j2 )\nand these terms lead to \"exploding\" scattering behaviour, as we shall explain\nT\nbelow. Replacing \u01742T by \u0174 \u2032 2 simply means cancelling these terms in order to\nobtain stable one-particle states. In some special cases this can be motivated as\n5\n\n\fa \"renormalization procedure\", see [4]. We will also drop the ' and write \u01742T\nfor the \"new\" 2-point functions from now on.\nWe now briefly recall some basic notions of axiomatic scattering theory following [7].\nR\n0\nFor l = 1, . . . , n let \u03c6tl,sl (x) = (2\u03c0)\u2212dn/2 Rd eikl *x \u03c6\u0302l,sl (k)ei(kl \u2212\u03c9l,sl )t dkl ,\nwhere \u03c6\u0302l,sl is a Schwartz function with values in CL and support in {kl0 >\n0, |kl2 \u2212 m2sl | < \u01eb} for \u01eb small enough that non of these neighbourhoods intersect\np\nfor msl 6= ms\u2032l and \u03c9l,sl = |kl |2 + m2sl .\nWe say that a sequence of truncated Wightman functions WnT has non trivial\nscattering behaviour, if the limits\nout T\nh\u03c61,s1 * * * \u03c6in\nr,sr |\u03c6r+1,sr+1 * * * \u03c6n,sn i =\nlim\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nZ\n\nRdn\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1r ,\u2212t,\u2217\n\u03b11 ,\u2212t,\u2217\nT\n(xr )\n(x1 ) * * * \u03c61,s\n(x1 , . . . , xn )\u03c6r,s\nWn,\u03b1\nr\n1 ***\u03b1n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n,t\n\nr+1\n\u03b1n ,t\n(xn )dx1 * * * dxn ;\n(xr+1 ) * * * \u03c6n,s\n\u00d7\u03c6r+1,s\nn\nr+1\n\nin/out\nin/out T\nh\u03c61 * * * \u03c6r\n|\u03c6r+1 * * * \u03c6n\ni =\n\nRdn\n\n\u03b1r ,\u2212t,\u2217\n\u03b11 ,\u2212t,\u2217\nT\n(xr )\n(x1 ) * * * \u03c61,s\n(x1 , . . . , xn )\u03c6r,s\nWn,\u03b1\nr\n1 ***\u03b1n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n,\u2212t\n\nr+1\nn ,\u2212t\n(xr+1 ) * * * \u03c6\u03b1\n\u00d7\u03c6r+1,s\nn,sn (xn )dx1 * * * dxn\nr+1\n\n(12)\n\nexist and are not identically equal to zero for n \u2265 3.

We first consider point (ii). This is a rather straight forward generalization of the Theorems 1 and 2 of [3] and it can be obtained using the techniques\ndeveloped there, see [6] for the details of the proof and further generalizations.\nNote that the condition that QE (k) is prime w.r.t the factors (|k|2 + m2s ) implies that QM,n does not vanish identically on the mass-shells and therefore the\nscattering amplitudes are not identically equal to zero.\nIt remains to prove point (i). Note that ( \u2202k\u22020 2 ) = (\u00b1 2k10 \u2202k\u2202 0 ) on the sup\u00b1,(j \u22121)\n\nport of \u03c6\u0302l,sl (\u00b1k). Therefore we get \u03b4msl l\n1\n(kl2 \u2212m2s )jl\nl\n\n=\n\n(\u22121)jl \u22121\n1\n1\n\u2202 jl \u22121\n(jl \u22121)!

Using Par-\n\nl\n\nseval's theorem and integration by parts we get for the right hand side of Eq.\n(9)\nZ\nT\n(k1 , . . . , kn )\u03c8(t, k1 , . . . , kn ) dk1 * * * dkn ,\n\u0174n,(m\nr ,1)***(m1 ,1)(mr+1 ,1)***(mn ,1)\nRdn\n\nwhere \u03c8(t, k1 , . . . , kn ) is a sum over functions of the type\nn\nY\n0\n1 \u2202\n(\u2217)\n(\u00b1 0 0 )jl \u22121 e\u00b1i(kl \u00b1\u03c9l,sl )t \u0125l (\u00b1kl ),\n2kl \u2202kl\nl=1\n\nwhere jl takes values from 1 to \u03bdl and the \u0125l are scalar functions obtained by\nl\ncontraction of the \u03c6\u0302\u03b1\nl,sl with the tensor-valued polynomial QM,n,\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1n (k) and\nmultiplication with factors 1/kl0 and thus having the same support properties\nl\nas the \u03c6\u0302\u03b1\nl,sl . If \u03bdl > 1 for some l, such functions can be written as a sum of\nQn\nPn\n0\n(\u2217)\nfunctions of the type tr \u00d7 l=1 e\u00b1i(kl \u00b1\u03c9l,sl )t \u011dl (\u00b1k\nPl )nwith 0 \u2264 r \u2264 l=1 (\u03bdl \u22121).\nIf we consider the unique term with maximal r = l=1 (\u03bdl \u2212 1) \u2265 1, then, by (ii)\nof this theorem, the corresponding term in the scattering amplitude consists of\nan expression which converges to a constant 6= 0 (provided the \u03c6\u0302l,sl are chosen\nadequately) multiplied by a factor tr . Thus, the scattering amplitude in this\ncase diverges polynomially as t \u2192 \u221e.\nTheorem 2 shows that the scattering amplitudes of some of the quantum field\nmodels diverge polynomially. This is a remarkable fact, since it demonstrates\nthat a generalization the standard axiomatic scattering theory (Haag-Ruelle\ntheory) for quantum fields in positive metric to the case of quantum fields in\nindefinite metric is possible only under additional conditions (e.g. conditions on\nthe infrared singularities of the theory).\nAknowledgements.
