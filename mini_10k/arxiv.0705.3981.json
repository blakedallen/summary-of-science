Robertson\u2217\nOctober 22, 2018\n\nAbstract\nA gedanken experiment implies the existence of gravitomagnetism and raises\na question about what we know about the weak-field limit of the gravitomagnetic field of General Relativity.\n\n1\n\nThe Experiment\n\nImagine positive charge +Q essentially fixed to the origin of coordinates of system\nS \u2032 by virtue of having a large rest mass, Mo . Let a positive charge, q, of mass\nmo (<< Mo ) be placed distance y \u2032 from Q in S \u2032 and experience the influence of a\nCoulomb force, F\u2032 = kQqj/y \u20322 . The amounts of charge are chosen such that their\nrepulsion just balances their gravitational attraction F\u2032 = \u2212GM0 m0 j\u2032 /y \u20322 . Having\nset up this nice balance, you depart along the \u2212x\u2032 -axis at speed \u2212v.\nObviously, the masses will remain balanced from your new perspective in system\nS. But in your now moving frame it appears that both electric and magnetic forces\nact on q such that a magnetic field B = v \u00d7 E/c2 is created by the motion of Q\nrelative to you, p\nwhere E = \u03b3kQj/y \u20322 is the (foreshortened) electric field at q, due to\nQ. Here \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 . The sum of electric and magnetic forces as calculated\nin S is F = q(E + u \u00d7 B), where u is the velocity of q relative to S and, in this case\nu = v. This leads to combined electric and magnetic forces of\nF=\n\n\u03b3kQqj\n(1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )\ny2\n\n(1)\n\nClearly this is a weaker force than that observed in the original system S \u2032 and if\ngravity were not present it would lead to a slower separation of Q and q as they\nrepelled each other. From S, you would see the separation occur in a time dilated\nway. But now consider the gravitational attraction between masses M and m. The\nfact that you chose to go away and leave this balanced arrangement of electric\n\u2217\nstan.robertson@swosu.edu, Physics Dept., Southwestern Okla. State Univ., Weatherford, OK\n73096\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Here M >> m is located at the origin of coordinates of the S \u2032 system,\nwhich moves at speed v down the common x,x' axes relative to system S. Masses M\nand m are positively electrically charged with charges Q and q, respectively. Electric\nrepulsion and gravitational attraction are balanced, leaving both objects at rest with\nno net force between them in S \u2032 . In system S, electric, magnetic, gravitational and\ngravitomagnetic forces act.\nand gravitational forces can surely have no bearing on its subsequent behavior. To\nremain motionless as observed in system S, the total force of gravitational origin\nbetween the objects in system S must surely be\nF=\n\n\u2212\u03b3GM0 m0 j\n(1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )\ny2\n\n(2)\n\nAnd as originally balanced in S \u2032 , GMo mo = kQq. The part of the force in Eq. (2)\nthat is velocity dependent can be considered to be a gravitomagnetic force. In the S\nframe it must exist and must, and does, balance the ordinary magnetic force. One\nwould expect that Eq. (2) could be obtained by analogy with the electromagnetic\ncase. M would be the source of a g field as observed in S to be g = \u2212\u03b3GM0 j/y 2\nand also a source of a gravitomagnetic field Bg = v \u00d7 g/c2 in which m moves. Then\nif the sum of gravitostatic and gravitomagnetic forces would be\nF = m0 (g + u \u00d7 Bg )\n\n(3)\n\nwe would obtain Eq. (2) without further ado.\nBut the weak-field limit of General Relativity produces a gravitomagnetic field\nthat is\nBg = 4v \u00d7 g/c2\n(4)\n(see, e.g. ref [1]) which would lead to gravitomagnetic forces four times stronger\nthan required to balance the ordinary magnetic effect. The force of gravitational\n2\n\n\forigin in Eq. (3) would become\nF=\n\n\u2212\u03b3GM0 m0 j\n(1 \u2212 4v 2 /c2 )\ny2\n\n(5)\n\nI leave the reader to ponder where this goes wrong.\n\n2\n\nThe Free-Fall Problem in General Relativity\n\nTo see what gravitomagnetic effects we should expect, let us dispense with the\nelectric charges on M and m (Q = q = 0) and just consider the free fall of m toward\nM down the y \u2032 -axis starting from rest. In either frame, S or S \u2032 , the small test mass,\nm, would follow a geodesic. In the weak field limit of S \u2032 and in isotropic coordinates\nthe metric is\nds2 = (1 \u2212 2\u03c6)c2 dt\u20322 \u2212 (1 + 2\u03c6)(dx\u20322 + dy \u20322 + dz \u20322 )\nwhere \u03c6 = GMo /c2 r \u2032 . A Lorentz transform to frame S [x = \u03b3(x\u2032 + vt\u2032 )\n\u03b3(t + vx\u2032 /c2 ) y = y \u2032 z = z \u2032 ] yields\n\n(6)\nt =\n\nds2 = (1\u22122\u03c6\u03b3 2 (1+v 2 /c2 ))c2 dt2 \u2212(1+2\u03c6\u03b3 2 (1+v 2 /c2 ))dx2 \u2212(1+2\u03c6)(dy 2 +dz 2 )+(8\u03b3 2 \u03c6v/c)dxcdt\n(7)\nwhere, at the instant depicted in Figure 1, r \u2032 = y \u2032 = y. The last terms with dxdt\narise from the Lorentz transformation. The coefficient of 8 is exactly 4X larger\nthan expected from Newtonian theory combined with special relativity. It partially\ndescribes the \"gravitomagnetic\" effect. Of particular interest is that g01 R= 4\u03b3 2 \u03c6v/c\ncan be considered as arising from a vector potential Ag = (4\u03b3 2 G/c2 ) (J/r \u2032 )dV\nwhere J = \u03c1v is the mass current density and the gravitomagnetic field is taken to\nbe Bg = \u2207 \u00d7 Ag . But this term with its extra factor of 4 cannot completely describe\nall of the gravitomagnetic effects, for we have seen that that the assumption that it\ndoes leads to an unacceptable result for our gedanken experiment.\nIn the weak-field limit, we have det g \u2248 \u22121, neglecting terms involving \u03c6. We can\nuse the inverse of the Minkowski metric \u03b7 ij to raise indexes. The geodesic equation\nfor the y-component of motion of m is\nd2 y\n\u2248 \u2212(\u0393200 + \u0393211 vx2 /c2 + 2\u0393201 vx /c)\nc2 dt2\n\n(8)\n\nTaking g22 = \u03b7 22 = \u22121, there follows \u0393200 = \u0393211 = \u2212\u03b3 2 (1+v 2 /c2 )(\u2202\u03c6/\u2202y) and \u0393201 =\n(2\u03b3 2 v/c)(\u2202\u03c6/\u2202y). Then with a little algebra and using vx = v >> 0, vz = 0, vy \u2248 0,\nwe obtain\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\nd2 y\n(9)\n= \u03b3 2 [(1 + v 2 /c2 )2 \u2212 4v 2 /c2 ] = (1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )\n2\n2\nc dt\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\nwhich is exactly the same result that we get from Eq. (2) if the inertial mass on\nwhich F acts is \u03b3m0 . Eq. (9) is a geodesic equation that is correct to order v 2 /c2 .\n3\n\n\fWhat happens in Eq. (9) is that the term \u03b3 2 (1 + v 2 /c2 )2 manages to cancel 3/4 of\nthe effect of the factor of 4 in the gravitomagnetic field term. It would have been\nvery surprising to have obtained any different result, for that would have left the\ngeneral relativistic approach in conflict with special relativity. From the standpoint\nof special relativity, the freely falling mass could serve as an interval timer, with the\ninterval corresponding to the time to fall some particular small distance down the\ny'-axis. As observed in S, the interval would be dilated and that is exactly what\nis described by Eqs. (2) or (9). Apparently magnetic and gravitomagnetic forces\nprovide mechanism for enforcing time dilation.\nThe reason that the combination of Eqs. (3) and (4) fails to yield Eq. (9) and\ncorrectly describe the free-fall problem is that they are only correct to order v/c.\nThey have been combined to produce terms of order v 2 /c2 , but apparently not all\nof them. Under these circumstances, it would also be expected that they would not\ncorrectly predict all gravitomagnetic effects to order v 2 /c2 .\n\n3\n\nSpecial Relativity\n\nThe gedanken experiment can be made more interesting by allowing m to orbit M\nin a circular orbit of radius b as observed in S \u2032 . As observed in S, the orbital time\nperiod will be dilated and it can be shown from the kinematic equations of special\nrelativity that the orbit diameter will be the usual 2b along y-axis, but be contracted\nto 2b/\u03b3 along the x-axis. Further, a special case in agreement with special relativity\ncan be obtained from Eq. (8) using vx = v \u00b1 u, where u would be the speed of m\nrelative to M, as observed in S, when m is on the y-axis. Neglecting terms in u2 ,\nthe resulting acceleration of m for these positions would be\n\u2202\u03c6\nd2 y\n\u2248\n(1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 \u00b1 2uv/c2 )\n2\n2\nc dt\n\u2202y\n\n(10)\n\nThe last term of the equation accounts for the small difference of speeds of m and\nM relative to reference frame S.\n\n4\n\nLaser Lunar Ranging\n\nThe foregoing ruminations have been motivated by recent discussions of laser lunar\nranging. Murphy, Nordtvedt and Turyshev [2] have recently published new results\nthat claim to have verified Eq. (4) as a source of perturbing acceleration acting\non the lunar orbit. It is claimed that they have established this weak-field limit\nprediction of General Relativity to an accuracy of about 0.1%, which is far better\nconfirmation than expected from the Gravity Probe B experiment. Ciufolini [3] has\npointed out that the result of Murphy et al. is merely a coordinate dependent effect.\nTheir results were obtained relative to a solar system barycenter frame (hereafter\n4\n\n\fSSB) and thus could be transformed away. Kopeiken, on the other hand, says [4]\nthat there should be no observable effect at all relative to the SSB.\nWhile the gravitomagnetic field due to the sun's rotation cannot be transformed\naway, it is much too small to have a measurable effect on the lunar orbit. If a\ngravitomagnetic effect exists relative to the SSB it must be associated with the\nmotions of earth and moon relative to the SSB. For analysis of the lunar motions,\nthe orbital motion of earth would be regarded as the cause of a Bg field that is some\nfour orders of magnitude larger than that due to solar rotation at the position of\nthe moon.\nAt the time of a new moon, the situation would correspond to the masses m and\nM positioned as shown in Figure 1, with the sun located a long way up the y-axis.\nSystem S \u2032 would be comoving with the earth while system S would remain at rest\nrelative to the SSB. Thus whatever would be observed in S should be the same as\nwhat is measured relative to the SSB for this particular configuration. Considering\nthe outcome of the previous gedanken experiment, the major effects that we should\nobserve would be time dilation and length contraction. For a lunar orbit radius\nof 3.8 \u00d7 108 m and lunar velocity of \u223c 30 km/s, the contraction of the lunar orbit\nparallel to the nearly joint earth-moon orbital motion about the sun would be about\n1.9 m. This would be observed in frame S of Fig. 1, but not in the SSB frame.\nIn view of the gedanken experiment and Eqs. (2), (9) and (10), we should\nnot expect the combination of Eqs. (3) and (4) to be confirmed in the SSB frame,\nnotwithstanding the apparent confirmation by Murphy, Nordtvedt and Turyshev [1].\nThey transformed the LLR to the SSB frame and then fitted the lunar trajectory\nusing multiple adjustable parameters. In recent years the amplitude of the dominant\ngravitomagnetic oscillation has been reported as 6.5 m [1], 9.3 m [5] and 5.3 m\n[6]. Although the residuals of these curve fits to the lunar range observations are\ntypically less than one cm, the oscillation amplitudes are obviously much more\nvariable. Until the statistical errors of determination of the oscillation amplitude\nexclude the alternatives considered here, the claim that Eq. (4) has been confirmed\nis unwarranted.\nFinally, we should note that calculating gravitomagnetic effects relative to a geocentric frame removes several opportunities for error. In this frame the moon moves\nin a gravitomagnetic field due to the apparent motion of the sun. Shahid-Saless has\ncalculated the expected amplitude of gravitomagnetic lunar orbit oscillations to be\nabout 3 cm in the geocentric frame.\n\nReferences\n[1] Harris, E. G. 1991 Am. J.
