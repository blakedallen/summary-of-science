It has been\nfound that 87 Rb atoms have repulsive interaction in all\nthree quantum states. Also, the strength of repulsive interactions in F = 1, m = \u22121 and F = 2, m = 2 states are\nessentially identical. The interaction between an atom in\nthe F = 1, m = \u22121 state and another in the F = 2, m = 2\nstate is repulsive. As the change in the m value of a\natomic quantum state does not correspond to a substantial structural change, it is likely that such change would\nnot correspond to a large change in the atomic interaction.\nHere we study theoretically the collapse in a coupled BEC composed of two quantum states 1 and 2 of\na bosonic atom using the coupled time-dependent GP\nequation. We motivate this study by considering two\npossible atomic states of 7 Li whenever possible. An experiment of collapse in a coupled BEC has not yet been\nrealized but could be possible in the future. In the case\nof 7 Li the interaction in state 1 is taken to be attractive\nwhich is responsible for collapse. Here there are three\ntypes of interactions denoted by the scattering lengths\naij , i, j = 1, 2, between states i and j. A negative (positive) scattering length denotes an attractive (repulsive)\ninteraction. We study the collapse with different possibilities of attraction and repulsion between atoms in state\n1 and 2. If one of the scattering lengths is negative, at\nleast one component of the condensate may experience\ncollapse. If two of the scattering lengths are negative\none can have collapse in both components. Specifically,\none can also have collapse of both components if a12 is\nnegative and aii , i = 1, 2 are positive.\nThe usual GP equation conserves the number of atoms.\nThe dynamics of the collapse (growth and decay of number of atoms) is best studied by introducing an absorptive contact interaction in the GP equation which allows\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe experimental detection [1,2] of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at ultralow temperature in dilute\ntrapped bosons (alkali metal and hydrogen atoms and\nthe recent possibility in molecules) has spurred intense\ntheoretical activities on various aspects of the condensate [3\u20137]. Many properties of the condensate are usually described by the mean-field time-dependent GrossPitaevskii (GP) equation [6,8]. One of the most interesting features of BEC has been observed in the case of\nattractive interatomic interaction [2,3]. In that case the\ncondensate is stable for a maximum critical number of\natoms, beyond which the condensate experiences a collapse. When the number of atoms increases beyond the\ncritical number, due to interatomic attraction the radius\ntends to zero and the central density of the condensate\ntends to infinity. Consequently, the condensate collapses\nemitting particles until the number of atoms is reduced\nbelow the critical number and a stable configuration is\nreached. The condensate may experience a series of collapses [2,3]. This phenomenon was observed in the BEC\nof 7 Li atoms with negative scattering length denoting attractive interaction where the critical number of atoms\nwas about 1400 [2,3]. Theoretical analyses based on the\nGP equation in the case of 7 Li atoms also confirmed this\ncollapse [2,3,6,7].\nMore recently, there has been experimental realization of BEC involving atoms in two different quantum\nstates [9,10]. In one experiment 87 Rb atoms formed in\nthe F = 1, m = \u22121 and F = 2, m = 1 states by the\nuse of a laser served as two different species, where F\nand m are the total angular momentum and its projection [9]. In another experiment a coupled BEC was\nformed with the 87 Rb atoms in the F = 1, m = \u22121 and\nF = 2, m = 2 states [6,10]. It is possible to use the same\nmagnetic trap to confine atoms in two magnetic states\nand this makes these experimental investigations technically simpler compared to a realization of BEC with two\ndifferent types of atoms requiring two different trapping\nmechanisms. This is why so far it has not been possible to prepare a coupled BEC with two different types\nof atoms. In addition to coupled atomic condensates,\n\n1\n\n\ffor a growth in the particle number from an external\nsource. One has also to introduce an imaginary quartic\nthree-body interaction term responsible for recombination loss from the condensate [3]. If the strengths of\nthese two terms are properly chosen, the solution of the\ntime-dependent GP equation could produce a growth of\nthe condensate with time when the number of atoms is\nless than the critical number. Once it increases past the\ncritical number, the three-body interaction takes control\nand the number of atoms suddenly drops below the critical level by recombination loss signaling a collapse [3].\nThen the absorptive term takes over and the number of\natoms starts to increase again. This continues indefinitely showing an infinite sequence of collapse.\n\n(i)\n\nxrms (t) =\n\n2\nX\nh\u03042 1 \u2202 2\n1\n2 2\ngij Nj |\u03c8j (r, \u03c4 )|2\nr\n+\nc\nm\u03c9\nr\n+\ni\n2m r \u2202r2\n2\nj=1\n\u0015\n\u2202\n\u2212 ih\u0304\n\u03c8i (r, \u03c4 ) = 0,\n(2.1)\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n|\u03c6i (x, t)|2 dx\n\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nA. Stationary Problem\n\nFirst we consider the stationary solution of Eq. (2.2)\nwith \u03b3i = \u03bei = 0, which illustrate the collapse. As the\nthree scattering lengths aij and two numbers Ni are all\nindependent, the four parameters nij are also so with one\nrestriction: the signs of n12 and n21 are identical.\nNow we study the simplest case of collapse by taking\nonly the interaction between the atoms in state 1 to be\nattractive corresponding to a negative a11 . All other scattering lengths \u2212 a22 and a12 (= a21 ) \u2212 are taken to be\npositive. Quite expectedly, here the first component of\nthe condensate could experience collapse. Although the\npresent formulation is generally valid, one has to choose\nnumerical values of the parameters before an actual calculation.\nThe collapse of the first component is illustrated in Fig.\n1 (a) for n11 = \u22123.814, n22 = 4 n12 = n21 = 1, c1 = 0.25,\nc2 = 4. These parameters are in dimensionless units and\none can associate them with an actual physical problem\nof experimental interest. For this we consider the state 1\nto be the states of 7 Li with attractive interaction as in the\nactual collapse experiment with |a11 |/aho \u2243 0.0005 [2].\n\u221a\nAs n11 = 2 2N1 |a11 |/aho this corresponds to a boson\nnumber N1 \u2243 2700. This number is larger than the maximum number atoms permitted in the BEC of a single\ncomponent 7 Li which is about 1400 [2]. The presence of\nthe second component with repulsive interaction allows\nfor a formation of a stable BEC with more 7 Li atoms in\nquantum state 1 than allowed in the single-component\nBEC. Similar conclusion was reached by Esry [13] in a\nstudy of a coupled BEC in a different context. We find\nfrom Fig. 1 (a) that \u03c61 is very much centrally peaked\ncompared to \u03c62 . This corresponds to a small rms radius\n\ni = 1, 2, where m is the atomic mass. Here gij =\n4\u03c0h\u03042 aij /m is the coupling constant for atomic interaction, Nj the number of condensed atoms in state j, and\n\u03c9 the frequency of the harmonic oscillator trap. The parameter ci has been introduced to modify the frequency\nof the trap for the atoms in each quantum state.\nAs in Refs. [5] it is convenient\nto use dimensionless\n\u221a\nvariables defined by x = 2r/aho , and t = \u03c4 \u03c9, where\np\n\u221a\naho \u2261 h\u0304/(m\u03c9), and \u03c6i (x, t) = x\u03c8i (r, \u03c4 )( 2\u03c0a3ho )1/2 .\nIn terms of these variables Eq. (2.1) becomes [5]\n2\n\n\u22022\n|\u03c6j (x, t)|2\n|\u03c6i (x, t)|4\nci x2 X\nnij\n+\n\u2212 i\u03bei\n+\n2\n2\n\u2202x\n4\nx\nx4\nj=1\n\u0015\n\u2202\n\u03c6i (x, t) = 0,\n(2.2)\n+ i\u03b3i \u2212 i\n\u2202t\n\u221a\nwhere nij \u2261 2 2Nj aij /aho could be negative (positive)\nwhen the corresponding interaction is attractive (repulsive). In Eq. (2.2) we have introduced a diagonal absorptive i\u03b3i and a quartic three-body term \u2212i\u03bei |\u03c6i (x, t)|4 /x4\nappropriate to study collapse [3]. For \u03b3i = \u03bei = 0, i =\n1, 2, the normalization condition of the wave function is\nZ \u221e\n|\u03c6i (x, t)|2 dx = 1.\n(2.3)\n\u0014\n\n\u221e\n0\n\n#1/2\n\nTo solve Eq. (2.2) we discretize it in both space (using step 0.0001) and time (using step 0.05) employing a\nCrank-Nicholson-type rule and reduce it to a set of algebraic equations which is then solved by iteration using\nthe known boundary conditions, e.g., |\u03c6i (0, t)| = 0, and\nlimx\u2192\u221e |\u03c6i (x, t)| \u223c exp(\u2212x2 /4). The iteration is started\nwith the known normalized (harmonic oscillator) solution of Eq. (2.2) obtained with nij = 0 at t = 0. The\nnonlinear constants nij in this equation are increased by\nequal amounts over 500 to 1000 time iterations starting\nfrom zero until the desired final values are reached. This\niterative method is similar to one in the uncoupled case\n[3,5]. A detailed account of the numerical procedure for\nthe coupled case will appear elsewhere.\n\nWe consider the following spherically symmetric coupled GP equation with two components at time \u03c4 for the\ncondensate wave function \u03c8i (r, \u03c4 ) [12]\n\u2212\n\n0\nR\n\nx2 |\u03c6i (x, t)|2 dx\n\nIII.

If the number N1 is slightly increased\nbeyond 2700 the first component of the condensate wave\nfunction becomes singular at the origin and no stable\nstationary solution to Eq. (2.2) could be obtained.\nNext we discuss the collapse by taking only the interaction among atoms in two different states to be attractive\ncorresponding to a negative a12 (= a21 ). The atomic\ninteraction in both quantum states 1 and 2 is taken to\nbe repulsive corresponding to a positive a11 and a22 . Although it is a problem of theoretical interest for the study\nof collapse, it has no experimental analogue in terms of\n7\nLi. We illustrate the approximation to collapse in this\ncase in Fig. 1 (b) for parameters n11 = 1, n22 = 1.5,\nn12 = \u22125.95, n21 = \u22122, c1 = 1, c2 = 0.25. Both\nwave-function components are peaked near x = 0 and\nhave small rms radii. The system would collapse with\na small increase of |n12 | and/or |n21 |. Here the interactions among atoms in states 1 and 2 are both repulsive.\nThe collapse is a consequence of the attraction between\nan atom in state 1 and one in state 2. This leads to\na dominance of nonlinear off-diagonal coupling terms in\nthe coupled GP equation.\nFinally, in Fig. 1 (c) we illustrate the approximation to\ncollapse of both components when all scattering lengths\nare negative. This corresponds to taking all possible interactions attractive. The parameters in this case are\nn11 = n22 = \u22121, n12 = n21 = \u22120.552, c1 = 4, c2 = 0.25.\nThis has an experimental analogue in terms of two states\nof 7 Li. We assume the atomic interaction in both states\nto be equally attractive corresponding to a negative scattering length: a11 = a22 . For |a11 |/aho \u2243 0.0005 as in\nthe actual experiment [2], one has N1 = N2 \u2243 700. The\ntotal number of particles in this case is roughly 1400,\nwhich is equal to the critical number observed in the actual experiment of collapse in 7 Li. Both wave-function\ncomponents could become singular in this case as all possible interactions are attractive.\n\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\nand the rms radii by Eq. (2.4). The continued growth\nand decay of the number of particles in the condensate\nwould signal the possible collapse in a particular case.\nThe oscillation of the rms radius would demonstrate the\nconsequent radial vibration of the condensate.\nNow we study the time evolution of the number of\natoms of the two components and the corresponding rms\nradii. The general nature of time evolution is independent of the actual values of \u03b3i and \u03bei employed provided\nthat a very small value for \u03bei (\u223c 0.001) and a relatively\nlarger one for \u03b3i (\u223c 0.01 to 0.1) are chosen [3]. The following parameters were chosen in case of models (a), (b), and\n(c) of Fig. 1: (a) and (b) \u03b31 = \u03b32 = 0.03, \u03be1 = \u03be2 = 0.001,\n(c) \u03b31 = 0.15, \u03b32 = 0.03, \u03be1 = 0.002, \u03be2 = 0.003. The\nfractional change in the number of atoms for the two\ncomponents are shown in Figs. 2 (a), (b), and (c). The\nresults for 0 < t < 100 in Fig. 2 are calculated with 2000\niterations of the GP equation (2.2) using a time step 0.05.\nThe quadratic nonlinear terms in model (a) are all repulsive in channel 2, the corresponding wave function\n(\u03c62 ) of Fig. 1 (a) does not show any sign of approximation to collapse as in channel 1 where the diagonal\nnonlinear term is attractive. The results reported in Fig.\n2 (a) are consistent with this. The number of particles\nN1 of the first component undergoes successive growth\nand decay, whereas that of the second component keeps\non growing indefinitely typical to a repulsive interaction.\nFor model (b) the effective nonlinear terms in channels\n1 and 2 are both repulsive and it should be possible to\nhave collapse in both channels by decreasing the dominating off-diagonal quadratic nonlinear terms n12 and\nn21 corresponding to an increase in attraction between\nan atom in state 1 and one in state 2. However, for the\nactual parameters of this model only the component 1\nexhibits collapse. This is consistent with the more singular nature of \u03c61 reported in Fig. 1 (b), compared to\n\u03c62 . Consequently, in Fig. 2(b) only component 1 experiences collapse; the number of particles N2 keeps on\ngrowing with time.\nIn model (c) all the quadratic nonlinear terms are attractive. Consequently, in Fig. 2 (c) we find a series of\ncollapse in both channels. The collapse is most favored\nin model (c) with attractive diagonal and nondiagonal\nnonlinear terms. This corresponds to attraction between\ntwo atoms in state 1, between two atoms in state 2, and\nbetween an atom in state 1 and another in state 2. The\nnext favored case is of model (a) where the diagonal nonlinear term is negative in channel 1. Here only the atomic\ninteraction in state 1 is attractive, all other atomic interactions are repulsive. The least favored case is of model\n(b) where only the off-diagonal nonlinear terms are negative. This corresponds to repulsion between two atoms in\nstate 1, and between two atoms in state 2, and attraction\nbetween an atom in state 1 and another in state 2. In\nthe last case, collapse takes place due to the dominance\n\nB. Time-dependent Problem\n\nAlthough the collapse of the coupled condensates could\nbe inferred from the shape of the stationary wave functions of Fig. 1 (sharply peaked centrally with small rms\nradii), we also study the dynamics of collapse from a time\nevolution of the full GP equation (2.2) in the presence\nof an absorption and three-body recombination, e.g., for\n\u03b3i 6= 0 and \u03bei 6= 0 as in the uncoupled case [3]. For this\npurpose we consider the solution of Eq. (2.2) normalized\naccording to Eq. (2.3) at t = 0 obtained with \u03b3i = \u03bei = 0\nand allow this solution to evolve in time with \u03b3i 6= 0 and\n\u03bei 6= 0 by iterating the GP equation (2.2). The fractional\nchange in the number of atoms due to the combined effect of absorption and three-body recombination is given\nby\n\n3\n\n\fof the attractive nondiagonal nonlinear term over the repulsive diagonal one in channel 1. This is explicit in Fig.\n2 where the frequency of collapse decreases from model\n(c) to (a) and then to (b).\nFinally, in Figs. 3 (a), (b), and (c) the rms radii for\nthe two components are shown for models of Figs. 2 (a),\n(b), and (c), respectively. In case of models (a) and (b)\nwe find from Figs. 2 (a) and (b) that the number N2\ngrows with time. This is reflected in the growth of the\ncorresponding rms radii in Figs. 3 (a) and (b). In case of\nmodel (c) there is collapse in both channels and both the\nrms radii oscillate with time. This radial vibration of the\ncollapsing condensate(s) also takes place in the uncoupled\ncase [3]. However, from Figs. 3 (a) and (b) we find that\ndue to a collapse in one of the channels, both rms radii\ncould execute oscillations. In one of the channels it is a\ndirect consequence of collapse, in the other it is due to a\ncoupling to the channel experiencing collapse.\n\n[2] C. C. Bradley, C. A. Sackett, J. J. Tolett, and R.

CONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, we studied the collapse in a trapped BEC\nof atoms in states 1 and 2 using the GP equation when\nsome of the atomic interactions are attractive. We motivate parts of this study with two atomic states of 7 Li.\nThe component i of the condensate could experience collapse when the interaction among atoms in state i is\nattractive. Both components could experience collapse\nwhen at least the interaction between an atom in state 1\nand one in state 2 is attractive. The collapse is predicted\nfrom a stationary solution of the GP equation. The time\nevolution of collapse is studied via the time-dependent\nGP equation with absorption and three-body recombination. The number of particles of the component(s) of\nBEC experiencing collapse alternately grows and decays\nwith time. With the possibility of observation of coupled\nBEC, the results of this study could be verified experimentally in the future.\nThe work is supported in part by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico and\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nof Brazil.\n\n[1] J.
