These effects are thought to arise from the granularity\nof space-time at the Planck scale leading to a breakdown of Lorentz Invariance in its low\nenergy limit and would generally imply, in contrast with one of the most cherished and useful\nprinciples of physics, the existence of a preferential frame; a new version of the XIXth century\nEther1 . In fact a large collection of very tight bounds have been obtained by considering\nastrophysical observations and Laboratory experiments [3]. Moreover, a recent analysis of\nthe way that such a preferred frame granularity would affect the radiative corrections in the\nstandard model of particle physics, shows that the basic suppositions are in conflict with\nwhat we understand about quantum field theory together with even low accuracy tests of\nLorentz Invariance in particle physics [4, 5].\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore what seems to be the next most natural assumption regarding the way quantum gravity might become manifest. We shall first motivate a\nproposal, starting with a plausibility argument constructed to reconcile our intuitions about\nquantum gravity, with the evidence against a Violation of Lorentz Invariance (VLI) of the\nsort that has been considered. We will then present the new possible ways in which an effective theory might be the low energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, and finally\nwe shall explore the possible phenomenological implications of this new proposal.\nLet us try to motivate the need for a new approach to the subject. The idea is then that\nsomehow the fact that the underlying symmetry of the fundamental structure is itself the\nLorentz Symmetry, leads to a situation in which the large scale Lorentz Symmetry is protected by the symmetry of the fundamental granular structure. In other words, that, given\nthe symmetric nature of the granular structure, the existence of a fundamental granularity\nmight not show up as an observational brake-down of the symmetry, when the macroscopic\nphysical entity (here the spacetime geometry) is itself fully symmetric. Thus a region of\nspacetime, normally considered as well approximated by Minkowski metric, would not manifests the granular structure of the quantum spacetime, through the breakdown of Lorentz\nInvariance. This line of thought would then explain naturally the previously mentioned\nempirical evidence. The point, however, is not the explanation itself, which admittedly is at\nbest sketchy, but rather to motivate the next lines of thought. In view of the above, we note\nthat the only interesting situation that would be left open to investigations is that in which\nthe macroscopic space-time that is to be probed is not fully compatible with the symmetry\nof its basic constituents. The idea is to think in analogy to what happens when a large\ncrystal has the same symmetry (say cubic) of the fundamental crystal, one could expect no\ndeviations from fully cubic symmetry, as a result of the discrete nature of the fundamental\nbuilding blocks. However if one wants to build a macroscopic crystal whose global form is\nnot compatible with the structure of the fundamental crystals, say hexagonal, the surface\nwill necessarily include some roughness, and thus a manifestation of the granular structure,\nwould occur through a breakdown of the exact hexagonal symmetry.\nThis simple picture will be guiding our analysis, and in that respect we must keep in\nmind that we will be referring to the physical description of the situation at two levels. The\n1\n\nAnother possibility that has been considered in the literature are deformations of the Lorentz Algebra or\ntheir representations such as the so called Double Special Relativity (DSR) proposals [2]. We will not\ndeal with these ideas in this manuscript.\n\n2\n\n\ffirst, the effective or macroscopic level of description would correspond in the example of the\nphysics of solids, to a continuous description of physical objects, which we could envision as\nbeing expressed in terms of, say, a smooth metric and extrinsic curvatures of the surfaces\nof the solid, and smooth functions giving the mass density, pressures and viscosities in its\ninside, etc. In the case of gravitation it would correspond to general relativity. The second\nlevel would correspond to a fundamental quantum mechanical solid state description of both\nthe interior and surface constituents in the case of our solid object, and a yet unknown theory\nof the underlying and somehow granular structure of spacetime. The connection between\nthe two levels will be guided by symmetry arguments, and thus we will refer often using the\nfirst level of description to the situations in which the granular nature of the underlying or\nfundamental description would become manifest. We must keep this in mind for, otherwise,\nstatements involving simultaneously the two levels of description would seem nonsensical.\nFollowing with this line of thought and with the solid state physics analogy, we would\nexpect that it might be precisely in the event of a failure of the space-time to be exactly\nMinkowski in an open domain, that the underlying granular structure of quantum gravity origin, would become manifest, affecting the propagation of the various matter fields.\nThe effective description of such situation should thus involve the Riemann tensor, (which\nis known to precisely describe the failure of a space-time to be Minkowski over an open\ndomain). This is, we know that in every point of spacetime we can construct \"local inertial frames\" , corresponding to the Riemann Normal coordinates at that point, and that\nthe failure of such construction to provide an extended inertial frame is measured by the\nRiemann tensor. Thus the non-vanishing of Riemann would correspond to the macroscopic\ndescription of the situation where the microscopic structure of space-time might become\nmanifest. Moreover, we can expect, due to the implicit correspondence of the macroscopic\ndescription with the more fundamental one, that the Riemann tensor would also indicate\nthe space-time directions with which the sought effects would be associated. This would replace, in the current approach, the global selection of a preferential reference frame that was\nimplicit on most schemes of \u2013let us now refer to it as\u2013 the old approach towards Quantum\nGravity Phenomenology (QGP).\nIn fact, when considering the phenomenology, it is important to recall that the Ricci tensor\nrepresents that part of the Riemann tensor which, at least on shell, is locally determined by\nthe energy momentum of matter at the events of interest. Thus the coupling of matter to the\nRicci tensor part of the Riemann tensor would, at the phenomenological level, reflect a sort of\npointwise self interaction of matter that would amount to a locally defined renormalization of\nthe usual phenomenological terms such as a mass or kinetic term in the Lagrangian. However\nwe are interested in the underlying structure of space-time rather that the self interaction\nof matter. Thus we would need to ignore the aspects that are known to encode the latter,\nwhich in our case would correspond to all lagrangian terms containing only that part of the\nRiemann tensor proportional to the Ricci tensor, coupled to matter fields. The rest of the\nRiemann tensor can thus be thought to reflect the aspect of local structure of spacetime\nassociated solely with the gravitational degrees of freedom. This local structure, which is\ncodified in the macroscopic theory by the Weyl tensor, would in the microscopic theory reflect\naspects of the quantum gravitational structure of spacetime in itself. The effects we are\ninterested, which refer only to the gravitational aspects, and that would therefore constitute\na probe into the quantum mechanical nature of spacetime, would thus be associated with the\ncoupling of the Weyl tensor with the matter fields.In everyday situations (i.e. in the absence\nof gravitational waves) the Weyl tensor is also connected with the nearby \"matter sources\"\n3\n\n\fbut such connection involves the propagation of their influence through the spacetime and\nthus the structure of the latter would be playing a central role in the way the influences\nbecome manifest. In this sense the Weyl tensor reflects the \"nonlocal effects\" of the matter\nin contrast with the Ricci tensor or curvature scalar that are determinable from the latter\nin a completely local way.\nIn this paper we will start the investigation of such ideas, in a rather heuristic form,\nfirstly because we do not want at this point to commit ourselves to a specific proposal for\nthe quantization of gravitation, and secondly, because our first aim is to outline the simplest available options for a more complex realm of possibilities regarding quantum gravity\nphenomenology. The main objective of this work is, therefore, to open the way to a new perspective of analyzing (and possible observing) the fundamental discreteness of the spacetime\ngeometry.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we will study the most straight forward approach, showing that in this scenario the situation regarding the observability of\nthe quantum gravity effects, is very pessimistic as the suppressions turn out to be bigger\nthan expected at first sight. In Section III we will explore a more complicated approach,\nthat, on the one hand looks as rather contrived, at least in the tensor language, which we\nmust recognize, might not have much to do with the natural language that describes the\nquantum gravity realm, and on the other hand seems to yield relative large, and thus to a\nmore promising scenario for the observability of such effects. In Section IV we shall give\nsome arguments supporting our general view, but geared towards its realization in a particular approach to quantum gravity, the Loop Quantum Gravity Program. In Section V\nwe will discuss the expected orders of magnitude and other issues that would confront the\nexperimental investigation of these issues. We will end with a brief discussion of our analysis\nand with some conclusions in Section VI.\nII.\n\nSTRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH\n\nThe fundamental fields of the standard model are boson and fermions, thus we start by\nconsidering all couplings of such fields to the Riemann tensor. The Riemann tensor has\nmass dimension 2, the fermions have mass dimension 3/2 and the bosons have mass dimension 1. Naturally the dimension n Lagrangian terms would be suppressed by a factor\n(1/MPlanck )(n\u22124) . Furthermore we will as usual assume observer covariance and the absence\nof globally defined non-dynamical tensor fields. A careful examination will reveal that the\nleast possible suppression corresponds to a unique term involving coupling of fermions and\nthe Riemann tensor.\n\u03be\nL\u2032f =\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03a8\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03c1 \u03b3 \u03c3 \u03a8 ,\n(1)\nMPl\nwhere \u03a8 stands for the various fundamental spinor fields in the standard model, \u03b3 \u03bc for the\nDirac matrices, R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 for the Riemann tensor, and \u03be a dimensionless number characterizing\nthe geometrical aspects of the appropriate state of the quantum gravity theory and the\nfermions interaction with it. Note in particular that one can not write a similar dimension\n5 operator involving boson fields. To proceed further we note that we can write the product\nof the four gamma matrices in terms of the symmetrized and anti-symmetrized products\nleading to an expansion containing only the matrices \u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 5 , \u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc , and \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd = i[\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd ],\ntogether with the metric and the volume 4-form \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 . As already mentioned, we are not\ninterested in probing the terms involving the Ricci tensor or the scalar curvature, as they\n4\n\n\fwould be expressible using Einstein's equations in terms of the local energy momentum\ntensor associated with the matter fields. In this event the sole term that would be left is\n\u03be\nL\u2032f =\nW\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03a8\u0304\u03b3 5 \u03a8 .\n(2)\nMPl\nWhere W\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 stands for the Weyl tensor.\nHowever, as it is well known, the Riemann tensor, and thus also the Weyl tensor has a\nvanishing totally antisymmetric part, so W\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 0. We therefore conclude that there\nare no terms of this sort where the suppression factor is just 1/MPl . Then we move to\nconsider the terms suppressed by more powers of MPl these are: In scalar sector we have a\nterm,\n\u03be\nL\u2032\u03c6 = 4 W \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 Tr \u03a6 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03c3 \u03a6\n(3)\nMPl\nIn the fermion sector we have a term,\n\u03be\nL\u2032\u03c8 = 3 W \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03a8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03c3 \u03a8 .\n(4)\nMPl\nHere in principle, we should have used covariant rather than partial derivatives, but we\nuse this point to emphasize that we can choose at each point of space-time locally normal\ncoordinates constructed so that the Christofell symbols vanish at that point. In a very\nsmall region of space-time which our probe could be consider to occupy, we would thus have\nessentially Minkowski coordinates, and would in normal circumstances declare that gravity\nhas been turned off by using appropriately the free falling recipe to construct local inertial\nframes. In our scheme this turning off of gravitation would not be complete and there would\nbe a remaining effect due to the fact that space-time was in some sense granular rather than\ncontinuous and smooth, and that in its bending it (due in the case of interest the effects of\ndistant matter), the granular structure was forced to emerge. This is precisely what we seek\nto describe in this paper.\nIn the vector boson sector, taking into account the requirement of gauge invariance, we\nhave a term of the form\n\u03be\n(5)\nL\u2032m = 2 W \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 Tr (F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03c1\u03c3 )\nMPl\nThe pattern seems very clear, the suppression decreases with increasing spin of the field.\nThe minimum suppression given by the matter content of the standard model of particle\nphysics is therefore associated with the vector boson sector term (5) and amongst these the\nmost natural phenomenological arena would seem to be the one associated with the Maxwell\nfield.\nWe finalize this section by pointing out that the introduction of these new lagrangian\nterms would lead to a change not only in the dynamics of matter fields in the presence of\ngravitation, but also to a change of the response of the metric to the presence of matter\nfields. However it is easy to see that the latter would be even more suppressed that the\nformer. To see this let us write the total action as,\nZ\n1\n2\nS = MPl\nR(g) + LMatt (\u03a8) + n F (\u03a8, W ) ,\n(6)\nMPl\nwhere \u03a8 stands generically for the matter fields of the standard Model and W stands for the\nWeyl tensor. The equations of motion for the matter fields will receive a contribution proportional to MP\u2212n , while the Einstein tensor would receive extra contributions proportional\nto MP\u2212n\u22122 , and thus we will ignore the latter in the remainder of the manuscript.\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nAN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH\n\nFrom the previous analysis we seem to conclude that there can be no effect of the sort we are\ninterested in, and such that it is suppressed by the minimal amount that could be naturally\nassociated with a quantum gravity effect. This is in sharp contrast with the situation\nprevailing in the standard Quantum Gravity Phenomenology where the Violation of Lorentz\nSymmetry could, at least at first sight, be associated with dimension five operators, naturally\nsuppressed by one power of the Planck mass, and where radiative corrections would actually\ntend to transfer the violation to unsuppressed or even enhanced lower dimensional operators.\nHere we want to explore the possibility of effects of the type we have been discussing, with\nlower suppression, arising from alternative descriptions of the spacetime curvature.\nWe are interested, for phenomenological reasons, in schemes in which locally the gravitational degrees of freedom select preferential directions, planes or other subspaces of spacetime. This would present us with a scheme in which, in contrast with the old Quantum\nGravity Phenomenology, there is no need to choose an add hoc direction in spacetime, but\nwhere the gravitational environment would be making the selection of the locally preferred\ndirections which could be naively considered as local violations of absolute Lorentz invariance. Clearly a situation much closer to the Machian spirit and that of G.R. than that of the\nold QGP. The phenomenological motivation is that the situations involving the breaking of\nsymmetries afford in general a much more promising experimental scenario, than those that\ndo not, specially dealing with what could be at most, extremely small effects. Needless is\nto say that this approach is less natural than the one we investigated in section II, and the\nonly remark that we can make in this regard is to note that the degree of naturalness can be\nexpected to depend on the language employed, and that is conceivable that if one were to\nuse the language most appropriate to describe the quantum gravitational degrees of freedom\n\u2013 an issue that is still unknown as far as we are concerned \u2013 objects, that look unnatural in\nthe tensorial language appropriate to sub-Planckian phenomena, might be rather natural,\nin that, still to de determined, quantum gravity language. As an illustration of this point,\nwe recall that in Loop quantum gravity the fundamental degrees of freedom are associated\nwith holonomies and fluxes, and thus are at some level fundamentally nonlocal, in contrast\nwith the local degrees of freedom usually represented in terms of tensor fields.\nThe idea is then to search for tensors of lower type containing information about the\nspacetime curvature. Clearly these have to contain information already available in the\nRiemann tensor, but perhaps not all such information. We are thus driven to look at the\nWeyl tensor, the principal null vectors of the Weyl tensor and so forth. One approach that\nseems to yield the kind of terms we are interested is to consider the Weyl tensor viewed as a\ntensor of type (2, 2) as a mapping from the space of antisymmetric tensors of type (0, 2), S\ninto itself. As is well known the spacetime metric endows the six dimensional vector space\nS with a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (+ + + \u2212 \u2212\u2212) [7]. Then the Weyl tensor\nis a symmetric operator on this space S , which can therefore be diagonalized, and thus\nhas a complete set of eigenvectors (which are however not necessarily orthogonal). Let us\nconsider only the eigenvectors \u039e(i) corresponding to non-vanishing eigenvalues \u03bb(i) , by fixing\nthe normalization of these eigenvectors to be \u00b11 (also drop the null eigenvectors)2 . We will\nalso assume for simplicity, and in order to avoid possible ambiguities, that all eigenvalues are\n2\n\nIn spacetimes of astrophysical interest such as the Kerr metric, this decomposition of the Weyl tensor is\nindeed possible and can be explicitly done.\n\n6\n\n\fdifferent. We can now use the antisymmetric tensors \u039e(i)\n\u03bc\u03bd and their associated eigenvalues\n(i)\n\u03bb to construct the types of Lagrangian terms we are interested in. In the same spirit as\nbefore, searching for terms linear in these objects, and recalling that the eigenvalues \u03bb(i)\nhave the dimension of the Riemann tensor, we have the least possible suppressions in each\nsector as follows: In scalar sector we have a term,\nL\u03c6 =\n\n\u03be X i (i)\n\u03bb \u039e\u03bc\u03bd Tr \u03a6 \u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd \u03a6 .\n2\nMPl\ni\n\n(7)\n\nIn the fermion sector we have a term,\nL\u03c8 =\n\n\u03be X i (i)\n\u03bb \u039e\u03bc\u03bd \u03a8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u03a8 .\nMPl i\n\n(8)\n\nIn vector boson sector, taking into account the requirements of gauge invariance, we are lead\nto a term\n\u03be X i (i)\n\u03bb \u039e\u03bc\u03bd Tr (F\u03c1\u03bc F \u03c1\u03bd ) .\n(9)\nLm = 2\nMPl i\nThus the fermions provide the most promising probes, which seems a fortunate situation, in\nthis scheme.\nAs it was pointed out to us, by a charitable soul, one could also consider coupling directly a scalar made out of the standard model fields to an appropriate power of a scalar\nconstructed out of the Weyl tensor such as (W\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 W \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 )1/2 . This proposal, while very\nreasonable, departs slightly from the spirit of our attempts to indicate that the space-time\nstructure would naturally and locally select preferential directions, in a way that could be\nprobed experimentally. Moreover, the lack of any such seemingly Lorentz invariance violating interactions would tend to make the effects much harder to detect experimentally. On\nthe other hand this line opens the way to consider, despite their seeming unnaturalness,\neffects that would not be suppressed by any power of the Planck mass, such as\nL\u03c8 = (W\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 W \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 )1/4 \u03a8\u0304\u03a8 .\n\n(10)\n\nWe will not focuss on this last proposal in this manuscript.\nIV.\n\nSOME MOTIVATIONS FROM QUANTUM GRAVITY\n\nIn this section we shall give give some heuristic arguments to the effect that the basic\nvariables and the strategy followed to get to an effective QFT (on a background) coming\nfrom loop quantum gravity [6], and from String Theory, might allow for the type of terms\nthat we have proposed before.\nLet us first look at the issue from the LQG perspective. We start with the observation\nthat LQG is based on a connection formulation of General Relativity, where one of the\nC\nbasic objects is an SO(3, 1) connection AB\n\u03bcC , whose curvature F\u03bc\u03bdB is, on shell, equal to the\nRiemann tensor. The second observation is that there is a very close relationship between the\nalgebraic structure of the Riemann tensor (or the Weyl tensor in vacuum) and the so called\nholonomy group of the spacetime. Basically the idea is that on a given point on spacetime,\nthe holonomy along small closed curves, yielding elements of the gauge group (Lorentz)\nwill belong to a specific subgroup of the Lorentz group [8], depending on the algebraic\n7\n\n\fstructure of the curvature tensor. Furthermore, the proper bivectors \u039e(i) appearing in the\nexpansion (8) will have information precisely about the holonomies of the curvature tensor\nat that point. This is particularly relevant given that in the LQG formalism, both in the\nHamiltonian approach (where the curvature is now only referring to the spacial part of the\nLorentz group, namely local rotations), and in the still incomplete Lagrangian formulation\n(spin foams), the curvature tensor is always approximated by one of the fundamental objects\nin the theory, namely, the (quantum) holonomy.\nOne can imagine that a detailed treatment of semiclassical states for the geometry and\nthe regularization of the matter fields on top of the quantum geometry (assuming that the\nsubtleties and ambiguities already encountered in the discretization procedure, are resolved),\nmight yield terms of the form (8). Let us now briefly discuss how this terms might arise. In\nthe standard Hamiltonian for a spinor field one has a term of the form,\nH=\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3x NEia \u221a\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ni\u03c0 T \u03c4i Da \u03c6 + Da (\u03c0 T \u03c4i \u03c6) + * * * .\ndet q\n\n(11)\n\nwhere N is the lapse function, det q is the determinant of the spatial metric, Eia is the triad\nfield, Da = \u2202a + [Aa , * ] is the covariant derivative, associated with the spatial connection\nAa , \u03c6 is the Weyl spinor corresponding to the fermion field, \u03c0 its canonical conjugate, and\n\u03c4i are the Pauli matrices. A standard trick is to bring this integral to the form,\nH=\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb\n\nd3xN \uf8ed4\u01ebijk \u01ebabc\n\n\uf8f6\n\n{Aia (x), V (x, \u03b4)} , {Ajb , V (x, \u03b4)} \uf8f8\nq\n\nq(x)\n\n[\u03c0 T \u03c4k Dc \u03c6 \u2212 c.c.] ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere V (x, \u03b4) is the volume element in a finite region. When the expression is turned into\nan operator, one replaces the Poisson brackets for commutators and the connection Aia is\napproximated by holonomies. Finally, the strategy is to consider semi-classical states |W, \u03bei\nof the geometry and the matter, and to compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian\noperator \u0124 on this state to get an effective Hamiltonian for the spinor field. In the existing\nworks on this subject (see [6]) some simple assumptions for the expectation values of certain\noperators in the semi-classical state are made, in particular in connection with the properties\nof the resulting geometry such as rotational symmetry of the macroscopic spacetime that\ncorresponds to the state of the quantum geometry. Our observation is that, in describing at\nthe fundamental level a region of spacetime which corresponds macroscopically to a given\ngeometry, one would require a sufficiently detailed (and sophisticated) semiclassical state\n|W, \u03bei that will contain, perhaps in a rather convoluted way, information about the extended\nspace-time structure, and thus it should yield, subleading terms of the desired form (8), in\nthe expectation values of complex operators.\nIt is, we believe, certainly worth pursuing this avenue, where the manifestation of the\nunderlying discreteness would not be present as universal modifications of dispersion relations (closely related to LIV), but in the appearance of these new terms in the effective field\ntheory, which would produce them locally. Needless to say, some work is needed in this\ndirection to make these ideas precise.\nFrom the String Theory outlook the situation is not clear because at this time there is no\nNonperturbative formulation of the theory which includes a complete and clear understanding of the emergence of physical spacetime. However it seems safe to argue that any such\nscheme would at some level describe a mildly curved spacetime in terms of a sufficiently\ncomplex state involving many gravitons. As the spacetime curvature of the situation we envision is macroscopic, the gravitons would be in some sort of coherent state. It is well known\n8\n\n\fthat the Weyl tensor is intimately connected with the polarization of a gravitational wave\nand thus it will be connected with the common polarization of the gravitons in the coherent\nstate. In string theory the standard interaction of gravitons and other matter fields arises\nat the lowest order in perturbation theory, but other forms of interaction\ninvolving heavier\n\u221a\n\u2032\nmodes are known to occur, however suppressed by the string length \u03b1 , in the perturbation\nexpansion. These higher order interactions will couple the gravitons to matter and it is quite\nnatural to expect that some of these interactions will be polarization dependent. Thus a\nmechanism to produce an effective coupling of the spacetime curvature (associated with the\npolarization of the gravitons) and suppressed by the string mass scale which we take to be\nof the order of MPl seems to be in place.\nLet us now consider the possible approaches for experimental tests for these type of\ntheories.\nV.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGY\n\nThe views presented here clearly call for a reassessment of the phenomenology of quantum\ngravity. To start with, we are called to concentrate clearly in the fermion sector as it is the\none leading to the most promisingly observable effects.\nLet us write again the corresponding Lagrangian term now taking into account possible\nflavor dependence;\nX \u03bea X\n(2)\n\u03bc \u03bd\nLf =\n\u03bbi \u039e(i)\n(13)\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03a8\u0304a \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03a8a .\na MPl i\nwhere a denotes flavor. Next we note that we have in principle the same types of effects that\nhave been considered in the Standard Model Extension (SME) [9] but only with terms\nof the\n2\u03be P\n\u03bc\u03bd\nform \u22121/2H\u03bc\u03bd \u03a8\u0304\u03c3 \u03a8. Moreover, here the tensor H\u03bc\u03bd must be identified with \u2212 MPl i \u03bbi \u039e(i)\n\u03bc\u03bd\nhas a predetermined space-time dependence dictated by the surrounding gravitational environment.\nThus different experiments at different sites could be compared only after taking into\naccount the differences in the surrounding environment that leads to variable values of the\nrelevant curvature related tensors.\nThe relevant experiments would thus be associated with both, relative large gravitational\ntidal effects (indicating large curvature) in the local environment together with either very\nhigh sensitivities in the probes. Furthermore it is clear that the probes would need to involve\npolarized matter as the explicit appearance of the Dirac matrix [\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd ] indicates. Naturally\nneutrinos crossing regions of large curvature such as supernova interiors come to mind. It\nis noteworthy that a term of the sort we are considering could lead to neutrino oscillations\neven if they are massless, in close analogy with the ideas exposed in [13].\nNext we note that the term in question does not violate CPT so that that particular\nphenomenological avenue is closed. On the other hand other discrete symmetries, particularly CP could, depending on the environment and state of motion of the probes be open\nchannels for investigation.\nIn the case of potentially flavor dependent effects, which would look as violations of the\nequivalence principle, we must recall that in the present scheme these are expected only in\nregions with large gravitational gradients. Thus the fifth force type tests [14], such as the\ntorsion balance experiments must be revised. The relevant non-relativistic hamiltonian for\na particle with flavor a can be directly read of from equation (13) using the formulation of\n9\n\n\f[10] as\nh\n\ni\n\nHNR = \u01ebjkl ( 21 Hkl (\u03c3j + (~\u03c3 * ~p) pj /m2 ) \u2212 (1 + 21 p2 /m2 )Hl0 \u03c3k pj /m\n\n(14)\n\nWe note that the term proportional to Hl0 can only come from a non-stationary aspect of\nthe source which in the case of ground based experimental setups case would seem to entail\nthe Earth's rotation, and would thus be further reduced in magnitude. The remaining part\nwould seem to be the most promising one, and in this case we should clearly focuss on the\nfirst term.\nTo do this we write this term as\n~ * ~\u03c3\nHNR = \u03be(1/MP )C\n\n(15)\n\n(l)\n\nwhere Ci = (1/2)\u01ebijk l \u03bbl \u039ejk is a sort of magnetic field, which is associated with the Weyl\ntensor. As such, in ordinary conditions (static matter sources) we can expect it to be\nof order GM/r 3 , a feature that indicates that in contrast with the case of the ordinary\nNewtonian gravity, the effects of small and close-by sources will be of the same relative\nimportance as those of large but relative distant sources. In the case of a spherical source,\nfor instance the effect at its surface, will be determined solely by its density and not by its\nsize |C| \u2248 (4\u03c0/3)G\u03c1. This is a serious impediment for constructing sources that can lead\nto large effects. From this perspective, the most attractive location for a test would be, the\nvicinity of a nucleus where tests such as those designed to look at a possible scale dependence\nof the gravitational consatant[12] could be of use, and also the surface of neutron stars.\nIn the realm of more ordinary and Earth-based alternatives, one needs to note the need\nto use spin polarized matter in the probe, which normally makes the experiments difficult\ndue to magnetic effects.\nTo estimate order of magnitude of the effects one would be seeking in an the experiment\nwe compute the ratio of the contribution to the energy of the term in question to the ordinary\npotential gravitational energy of the probe. That is,\nP\n\n\u03b4E\nh\u03c3i(\u03be/MPl )(GM/r 3 )\n(lCompton /cm)\n=\n= \u03be(lp lCompton /r 2 )P = \u03beP 10\u221225\nE\n(GMm/r)\n(r/10\u22124 cm)2\n\n(16)\n\nWhere, r is the effective size of the source and P stands for the mean polarization of matter,\nlCompton is the Compton length of the constitutive fermions.3 Where we have taken as\nindicative of what one must look for, the value of r to be of the order of the distances\nprobed in recent Grenoble neutron experiments [15] r \u2248 10\u22124 cm. As for the Compton\nwavelength we should point out that, for instance, the neutral Kaon system has a Compton\nlength associated to the mass difference of the order of 30 cm [16]. One should then look for\nsystems (like a solid) whose excitations have an effective mass and thus a Compton length\nthat is large enough to have a sizable possibility of having observable effects.\nSpecial attention should be directed into experiments with single polarized particles (so\nthat P = 1), in the quantum regime, where one would look for unexpected phase changes\nassociated with the polarization and with the presence of gradients of the Newtonian gravitational acceleration. These again can be expected to be extremely small, however we\nshould point out that in the limited experimental evidence there is a report of a rather large\n3\n\nWe would need to model the contribution of quarks and electrons to the overall spin polarization of the\nprobe, and weight their Compton lengths appropriately\n\n10\n\n\fanomaly (one part in 103 violation of the equivalence principle) seen in interference experiments probing the gravitational field with neutrons [17] while similar experiments using\natoms do not observe anything despite a higher precision [18]. In this case the effect seems\nto be many orders of magnitude larger that what we could expect, and of course, in all\nsuch cases of reported anomalies these must be taken with great care, and therefore at this\npoint and given its magnitude we are not taking it as indicative of evidence in favor of our\nproposal but rather just as an example of the kind of effects one might hope to investigate\nwithin this setting.\nWe end up emphasizing that although, one could think that unless \u03be is unexpectedly\nlarge, the outlook for detecting such effects is not particularly promising, however we should\nkeep in mind the lack of relevant experimental results. In particular, one of the challenges\nthat programs such as Loop Quantum Gravity should face in the near future is to construct\nsuitable semiclassical states corresponding to situations in which large regions with specific\nbut small curvatures are present. In that light, any experimental bounds found by a program like the one suggested here, would play a significant role in guiding the theoretical\ndevelopments, much as the E\u00f6tvos and other early test of the equivalence principle, played\nin the construction of General Relativity.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have considered a new phenomenological scenario to search for signatures of quantum\ngravity. This new scheme starts by rejecting from the outset the notion of preferential frames,\nthus keeping intact the conceptual framework leading to special and general relativity.\nWe must emphasize at this point that for instance, loop quantum gravity, has nothing in\nits framework that necessitates the breakdown of Lorentz Invariance that is associated with\nthe existence of a preferential reference frame. All that has been said in this regard up to\nthis point are heuristic proposals for states of the theory [6], that would result in the types\nof effects discussed in [1]. Moreover, given any of such states, there is nothing in principle\npreventing the construction of new states by applying a kind of group averaging procedure\nby means of Lorentz boost (using an appropriate Loop quantum gravity operator) to the\noriginal state. In this way one could conceive a suitable 'superposition' of states which will\nnot be associated with any preferential frame. Such type of scenario would be immune to\nthe constraints being set by the previous explorations of Quantum Gravity Phenomenology.\nFurthermore, one might imagine that (in the case one could construct) a quantum state that\nsatisfies the full set of constraints, being thus fully diffeomorphism invariant, would be in\nan appropriate sense necessarily devoid of the problem of emergence of preferential frames.\nThe proposal here is clearly beyond anything that has been considered so far, and the\nsearch for experiments that could provide relevant information seem from the onset to be\nvery challenging indeed. We hope however that the ideas proposed here will motivate our\ntheoretical and experimental colleagues to explore these intriguing possibilities, either trough\nsome of the directions we have mentioned here, or trough some new and cleverly devised\nexperimental set-ups.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank A.
