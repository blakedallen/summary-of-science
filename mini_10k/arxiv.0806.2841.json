Four-image lens systems with fold and cusp configurations\nhave two or three bright images near a critical point. Within the framework of singularity theory, we derive analytic relations that are satisfied for a light source that\nlies a small but finite distance from the astroid caustic of a four-image lens. Using a\nperturbative expansion of the image positions, we show that the time delay between\nthe close pair of images in a fold lens scales with the cube of the image separation, with\na constant of proportionality that depends on a particular third derivative of the lens\npotential. We also apply our formalism to cusp lenses, where we develop perturbative\nexpressions for the image positions, magnifications and time delays of the images in a\ncusp triplet. Some of these results were derived previously for a source asymptotically\nclose to a cusp point, but using a simplified form of the lens equation whose validity\nmay be in doubt for sources that lie at astrophysically relevant distances from the\ncaustic. Along with the work of Keeton et al. (2005), this paper demonstrates that\nperturbation theory plays an important role in theoretical lensing studies.\nKey words: gravitational lensing \u2013 cosmology: dark matter \u2013 cosmology: theory \u2013\ngalaxies: structure \u2013 methods: analytical\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGravitational lensing, or the bending of light by gravity, offers an exciting synergy between mathematics and astrophysics.\nSingularity theory provides a powerful way to describe lensing near critical points (Schneider et al. 1992; Petters et al. 2001),\nwhich turns out to have important implications for astrophysics and the quest to understand dark matter. Four-image lensed\nquasars can be broadly classified, according to image geometry, as either folds, cusps or crosses. We are interested in folds\nand cusps, which occur when the light source is close to the caustic curve, along which the lensing magnification is infinite\n(see top row of Fig. 1). Fold lenses feature a close pair of bright images, while cusp lenses have a close triplet of bright images\n(see bottom row of Fig. 1). By expanding the gravitational potential of the lens galaxy in a Taylor series, one finds that the\nimage magnifications satisfy simple analytic relations, viz.\n|\u03bcA | \u2212 |\u03bcB | \u2248 0\n\nand\n\n|\u03bcA | \u2212 |\u03bcB | + |\u03bcC | \u2248 0\n\n(1)\n\nfor fold pairs and cusp triplets, respectively (Blandford & Narayan 1986; Mao 1992; Schneider & Weiss 1992; Schneider et al.\n1992; Zahkarov 1995; Gaudi & Petters 2002a,b; Keeton et al. 2003, 2005). For a fold pair, the two images have opposite parity,\nhence the negative sign. For a cusp triplet, the middle image (B) has opposite parity from the outer images (A and C). Note\nthat in practice, one works with the image fluxes, which are directly observable, rather than the magnifications, which are\nnot. This leads to the equivalent relations:\nRfold \u2261\n\nFA \u2212 F B\n\u22480\nF A + FB\n\nand\n\nRcusp \u2261\n\nFA \u2212 FB + F C\n\u2248 0,\nFA + FB + FC\n\nwhere the image flux Fi is related to the source flux F0 by Fi = |\u03bci |F0 .\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\n\nA. B. Congdon, C. R. Keeton and C. E. Nordgren\n\nObservationally, the fold and cusp relations are violated in several lens systems (e.g., Hogg & Blandford 1994; Falco et al.\n1997; Keeton et al. 1997, 2003, 2005). These so-called \"flux-ratio anomalies\" are taken as strong evidence that lens galaxies\ncontain significant small-scale structure (e.g., Mao & Schneider 1998; Metcalf & Madau 2001; Chiba 2002). Since global\nmodifications of the lens potential (modeled with multipole terms, for example) cannot explain the anomalous flux ratios\n(Evans & Witt 2003; Congdon & Keeton 2005; Yoo et al. 2005, 2006), it is generally believed that lens galaxies must contain\nsubstructure in the form of mass clumps on a scale & 106 M (Dobler & Keeton 2006). Indeed, substructure is observed in\nat least two lens systems, in the form of a dwarf galaxy near the main lens galaxy (Schechter & Moore 1993; McKean et al.\n2007). The substructure could well be invisible, though; numerical simulations of structure formation in the cold dark matter\n(CDM) paradigm predict that galaxy dark matter halos are filled with hundreds of dark subhalos (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999;\nMoore et al. 1999). The abundance of flux-ratio anomalies in lensed radio sources implies that lens galaxies contain \u223c2%\n(0.6\u20137% at 90% confidence) of their mass in substructure (Dalal & Kochanek 2002). This may be somewhat higher than the\namount of CDM substructure (e.g., Mao et al. 2004), although new higher-resolution simulations are attempting to refine the\ntheoretical predictions and make more direct comparisons with lensing observations (e.g., Gao et al. 2004; Strigari et al. 2007;\nDiemand et al. 2007). While there is still work to be done along these lines, it is clear that violations of the ideal fold and\ncusp relations provide important constraints on the small-scale distribution of matter in distant lens galaxies.\nKeeton et al. (2003, 2005) pointed out that the ideal fold and cusp relations only hold for a source asymptotically close to\nthe caustic. If we want to use flux-ratio anomalies to study small-scale structure in lens galaxies, it is vital that we understand\nhow much Rfold and Rcusp can deviate from zero for realistic smooth lenses just because the source lies a small but finite\ndistance from the caustic. To that end, Keeton et al. (2003) used a Taylor series approach to demonstrate that Rcusp = 0 to\nlowest order, and used Monte Carlo simulations to suggest that Rcusp \u221d d2 , where d is the distance between the two most\nwidely separated cusp images. In order to derive the leading non-vanishing term in Rcusp analytically, it would be necessary to\nextend the Taylor series to a higher order of approximation. This has not been done before, since including higher-order terms\nsubstantially complicates the analysis. Instead, previous authors have made assumptions about which terms are important\nand which terms can be neglected, in order to obtain an analytically manageable problem.\nAs we shall see, perturbation theory provides a natural way to overcome the difficulties of the Taylor series approach.\nKeeton et al. (2005) used perturbation theory to show that for fold lenses, Rfold is proportional to the image separation d1 of\nthe fold pair. We extend their analysis in several important ways. We derive the leading-order non-vanishing expression for\nRcusp using perturbation theory. We also show, for the first time, how the combination of singularity theory and perturbation\ntheory can be used to study time delays between lensed images for both fold and cusp systems. Working in analogy to flux\nratios, we derive time-delay relations for fold and cusp lenses, which we will apply (in a forthcoming paper) to observed lenses\nin order to identify \"time-delay anomalies.\" As time delays join flux ratios in probing small-scale structure in lens galaxies\n(see Keeton & Moustakas 2008), singularity theory and perturbation theory once again provide the rigorous mathematical\nfoundation.\n\n2\n\nMATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES\n\nTo study lensing of a source near a caustic, it is convenient to work in coordinates centered at a point on the caustic.\nNonspherical lenses typically have two caustics. The \"radial\" caustic separates regions in the source plane for which one\n(outside) and two (inside) images are produced.1 Within the radial caustic is the \"tangential\" caustic or astroid, which\nseparates regions in the source plane for which two (between the two caustics) and four (inside the astroid) images are\nproduced. We are interested in four-image lenses, where the source is within the astroid. We therefore make no further\nreference to the radial caustic. A typical astroid is shown in Figure 1 for a lens galaxy modeled by a singular isothermal\nellipsoid (SIE), which is commonly used in the literature (e.g., Kormann et al. 1994) and appears to be quite a good model\nfor real lens galaxies (e.g., Rusin & Kochanek 2005; Koopmans et al. 2006). It is customary to define source-plane coordinates\n(y1 , y2 ) centered on the caustic and aligned with its symmetry axes. However, for fold and cusp configurations, where the\nsource is a small distance from the caustic, it is more natural to work in coordinates (u1 , u2 ) centered on the fold or cusp point.\nFor convenience, we define the u1 axis tangent to (and the u2 axis orthogonal to) the caustic at that point. Transforming\nfrom the (y1 , y2 ) plane to the (u1 , u2 ) plane requires a translation plus a rotation. To derive this coordinate transformation,\nwe follow the discussion in Appendix A1 in Keeton et al. (2005), which summarizes the results of Petters et al. (2001).\nWe begin by considering the lens equation y = x \u2212 \u2207\u03c8(x), which maps the image plane to the source plane. The solutions\nto this equation give the image positions x \u2261 (x1 , x2 ) corresponding to a given source position y \u2261 (y1 , y2 ). The function\n\u03c8(x) is the scaled gravitational potential of the lens galaxy projected onto the lens plane. A caustic is a curve along which\nthe magnification is infinite, i.e., det(\u2202y/\u2202x) = \u03bc\u22121 = 0, where \u2202y/\u2202x is the Jacobian of y, and is known as the inverse\n1\n\nWe are neglecting faint images predicted to form near the centers of lens galaxies, because they are highly demagnified and difficult to\ndetect.\n\n\fAnalytic Relations for Fold and Cusp Lenses\n\n3\n\nmagnification matrix. We choose coordinates such that the origin of the source plane (y = 0) is on the caustic. In addition,\nwe require that the origin of the lens plane (x = 0) maps to the origin of the source plane. We are interested in sources that\nlie near the caustic point (y = 0), which give rise to lensed images near the critical point (x = 0). In this case, we may expand\nthe lens potential in a Taylor series about the point x = 0. We then find that the inverse magnification matrix at x = 0 is\ngiven by\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\n\u0014\n\n1 \u2212 2\u00e2\n\u2212b\u0302\n\n=\n0\n\n\u2212b\u0302\n1 \u2212 2\u0109\n\n\u0015\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n1\n1\nb\u0302 = \u03c812 (0),\n\u0109 = \u03c822 (0).\n(4)\n\u00e2 = \u03c811 (0),\n2\n2\nThe subscripts indicate partial derivatives of \u03c8 with respect to x. Note that \u03c8 has no linear part (since y = 0 when x = 0).\nFor y = 0 to be a caustic point, we must have (1 \u2212 2\u00e2)(1 \u2212 2\u0109) \u2212 b\u03022 = 0. In addition, at least one of (1 \u2212 2\u00e2), (1 \u2212 2\u0109), and\nb\u03022 must be non-zero (Petters et al. 2001, p. 349). Consequently, (1 \u2212 2\u00e2) and (1 \u2212 2\u0109) cannot both vanish. Without loss of\ngenerality, we assume that 1 \u2212 2\u00e2 6= 0.\nWe now introduce the orthogonal matrix (see Petters et al. 2001, p. 344)\nM= p\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 2\u00e2)2 + b\u03022\n\n1 \u2212 2\u00e2\nb\u0302\n\n\u2212b\u0302\n1 \u2212 2\u00e2\n\n\u0015\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich diagonalizes \u2202y/\u2202x|0 . We then define new orthogonal coordinates by\n\u03b8 \u2261 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) \u2261 M x,\n\nu \u2261 (u1 , u2 ) \u2261 M y.\n\n(6)\n\nNote that the coordinate changes are the same in the lens and source planes. The advantage of using the same transformation\nin both the lens and source planes is that the lens equation takes the simple form\nu = \u03b8 \u2212 \u2207\u03c8(\u03b8),\n\n(7)\n\nand that the inverse magnification can be written as\n\u2202u\n.\n(8)\n\u2202\u03b8\nThe old and new coordinate systems in the source and image planes are shown in Figure 1. Since the caustic in the source\nplane maps to the critical curve in the image plane, the origin of the (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) frame is determined from that of the (u1 , u2 )\nframe. The orientation of the (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) axes is determined by the matrix M, and is not necessarily related to the tangent to\nthe critical curve.\nUsing the local orthogonal coordinates u and \u03b8, Petters et al. (2001, p. 346) showed that x = 0 is a fold critical point if\nand only if the following conditions hold\n\u03bc\u22121 = det\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u00e2)(1 \u2212 2\u0109) = b\u03022 ,\n\n1 \u2212 2\u00e2 6= 0,\n\n\u03c8222 (0) 6= 0.\n\n(9)\n\nFor a cusp, the third condition above is replaced by the requirements that\n\u03c8222 (0) = 0,\n\n\u03c8122 (0) 6= 0,\n\n\u03c82222 (0) 6= 0.\n\n(10)\n\nNote in particular that \u03c8222 (0) = 0 for a cusp while \u03c8222 (0) 6= 0 for a fold; this indicates that these two cases must be treated\nseparately.\nWe are interested in obtaining the positions, magnifications and time delays of images near critical points. Since these\nquantities depend only on the behavior of the lens potential near a fold or cusp point, we can expand \u03c8(\u03b8) in a Taylor series\nabout the point \u03b8 = 0. To obtain all the quantities of interest to leading order, we must expand the lens potential to fourth\norder in \u03b8 (Petters et al. 2001, pp. 346\u2013347):\n1\n1\n(1 \u2212 K) \u03b812 + \u03b822 + e \u03b813 + f \u03b812 \u03b82 + g \u03b81 \u03b822 + h \u03b823 + k \u03b814 + m \u03b813 \u03b82 + n \u03b812 \u03b822 + p \u03b81 \u03b823 + r \u03b824 ,\n(11)\n2\n2\nwhere the coefficients {K, e, f, g, . . . , r} are partial derivatives of the potential evaluated at the origin. Lensing observables\nare independent of a constant term in the potential, so we have not included one. Since \u03b8 = 0 maps to u = 0, any linear\nterms in the potential must vanish. In the second order terms, the coefficients of the \u03b81 \u03b82 and \u03b822 terms are set to 0 and 1/2,\nrespectively, in order to ensure that the point \u03b8 = 0 is a critical point (see Appendix A1 of Keeton et al. 2005).\n\n\u03c8(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) =\n\n3\n\nTHE FOLD CASE\n\nIn this section, we use perturbation theory (e.g., Bellman 1966) to derive an analytic relation between the time delays in\na fold pair. To derive this expression, we must first obtain the image positions at which the time delay is evaluated. These\n\n\f4\n\nA. B. Congdon, C. R. Keeton and C. E. Nordgren\n\nFigure 1. The curves show the caustic (top) and critical curve (bottom) for a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) lens with minor-tomajor axis ratio q = 0.5. The local orthogonal coordinates defined by the rotation matrix M are indicated for a fold point (left) and\na cusp point (right).

We offer a summary of their analysis in Section 3.1 and present our new results\nfor the time delay in Section 3.2.\n\n3.1\n\nImage Positions\n\nSince we are considering a source near a fold point, we write its position in terms of a scalar parameter \u000f, which we take to\nbe small but finite. In particular, let u \u2192 \u000fu.

To find the image positions, we expand \u03b81 and \u03b82 in a power series in \u000f. Since the\nleft-hand sides of equations (12) and (13) are accurate to O(\u000f), the right-hand sides must be accurate to the same order.\nNoting that the lowest-order terms on the right-hand side are linear or quadratic in \u03b8, we write\n\u03b81\n\n=\n\n\u03b11 \u000f1/2 + \u03b21 \u000f + O (\u000f)3/2 ,\n\n(14)\n\n\u03b82\n\n=\n\n\u03b12 \u000f1/2 + \u03b22 \u000f + O (\u000f)3/2 .\n\n(15)\n\nSubstituting into the lens equation, we obtain\n0\n\n=\n\n(\u03b11 K)\u000f1/2 \u2212 (3\u03b112 e + 2\u03b11 \u03b12 f + \u03b122 g \u2212 \u03b21 K + u1 )\u000f + O (\u000f)3/2 ,\n\n0\n\n=\n\n\u2212(\u03b112 f + 2\u03b11 \u03b12 g + 3\u03b122 h + u2 )\u000f \u2212 2\u03b11 \u03b21 f + 2(\u03b11 \u03b22 + \u03b12 \u03b21 )g + 6\u03b12 \u03b22 h + \u03b113 m + 2\u03b112 \u03b12 n + 3\u03b11 \u03b122 p + 4\u03b123 r \u000f3/2\n\n\u0002\n\n+O (\u000f)2 .\n\n(16)\n\n\u0003\n\n(17)\n\nNote that these equations are carried to different orders in \u000f, since the leading-order term in equation (12) is linear in \u03b8, while\nthe leading-order term in equation (13) is quadratic in \u03b8.\nSince \u000f is non-zero, equations (16) and (17) must be satisfied at each order in \u000f. We can work term by term to solve for\nthe coefficients \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u03b22 , and then write the image positions as\n\u03b81\u00b1\n\n=\n\n3hu1 \u2212 gu2\n\u000f + O (\u000f)3/2 ,\n3hK\n\nr\n\u03b82\u00b1\n\n=\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u2212u2 1/2 3ghu1 \u2212 g 2 u2\n\u000f\n\u2212\n\u000f + O (\u000f)3/2 ,\n3h\n9h2 K\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwhere the \u00b1 labels indicate the parities of the images. From these equations, we see that two images form near the point\n\u03b8 = 0 on the critical curve, provided that (\u2212u2 /3h) > 0. Since h 6 0 for standard lens potentials (e.g., an isothermal ellipsoid\nor isothermal sphere with shear), we must have u2 > 0. In other words, the source must lie inside the caustic in order to\nproduce a pair of fold images. In practice, a more useful quantity is the image separation, given by\n\nr\nd1 =\n\n3.2\n\n\u22124u2 1/2\n\u000f\n+ O (\u000f)3/2 .\n3h\n\n(20)\n\nTime Delays\n\nTo find the time delay between the two fold images, we begin with the general expression for the scaled time delay (e.g.,\nSchneider et al. 1992):\n\u03c4\u0302 (\u03b8) \u2261\n\n\u03c4 (\u03b8)\n1\n= | \u03b8 \u2212 u |2 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8).\n\u03c40\n2\n\n(21)\n\nThe scale factor is given by\n\u03c40 =\n\n1 + zL DL DS\n,\nc\nDLS\n\n(22)\n\nwhere DL , DS and DLS are the angular-diameter distances from the observer to lens, observer to source, and lens to source,\nrespectively. The lens redshift is denoted by zL . Making the substitution u \u2192 (\u000fu1 , \u000fu2 ), we have for the two fold images\n\nr\n\u03c4\u0302\u2212 \u2261 \u03c4\u0302 (\u03b8 \u2212 )\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n4\n(\u000fu2 )3/2 + O (\u000f)2 ,\n27h\n\nr\n\u03c4\u0302+ \u2261 \u03c4\u0302 (\u03b8 + )\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n4\n(\u000fu2 )3/2 + O (\u000f)2 .\n27h\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThe time delay between images is then (cf. Schneider et al. 1992, pp 190 - 191)\n\nr\n\u2206\u03c4\u0302fold \u2261 \u03c4\u0302\u2212 \u2212 \u03c4\u0302+ =\n\n\u2212\n\n16\nh\n(\u000fu2 )3/2 + O (\u000f)2 = \u2212 d31 + O (\u000f)2 ,\n27h\n2\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is positive, in agreement with the general result that images with negative parity trail those with positive parity. We\nfind that the only coefficient from the lens potential that enters the expression for the differential time delay is the parameter\nh = \u03c8222 (0)/6. We also see that to leading order in \u000f, the image separation and the differential time delay depend only on the\nu2 component of the source position. Unlike the image positions, our expression for the time delay does not involve any of the\nfourth-order terms in the potential. This is because the time delay involves the potential directly, while the image positions\ndepend on first derivatives of the potential. This means that all fourth-order terms in the potential enter the time delay at\nO (\u000f)2 , while these same terms enter at O (\u000f)3/2 in quantities involving derivatives.\n\n\f6\n\nA. B. Congdon, C. R. Keeton and C. E. Nordgren\n\nTo summarize, \u2206\u03c4\u0302fold \u221d (\u000fu2 )3/2 \u221d d31 . For comparison, Rfold \u221d d1 . Since d1 is small, a violation of the ideal relation\n\u2206\u03c4\u0302fold = 0 is more likely to indicate the presence of small-scale structure in the lens galaxy than would be indicated by a\nnon-zero value of Rfold .\nOur analytic expression for \u2206\u03c4\u0302fold is only valid for sources sufficiently close to the caustic that higher-order terms are\nnegligible. To quantify this statement, we compare our analytic approximation with the differential time delay computed\nnumerically from the exact form of the lens equation. The numerical analysis requires a specific lens model, so we consider\nan SIE with axis ratio q = 0.5 as a representative example. We use the software of Keeton (2001) to compute the astroid\ncaustic, and then choose a point on the caustic, far from a cusp, to serve as the origin of the (u1 , u2 ) frame. For a given value\nof u2 , we solve the exact lens equation to obtain the image positions and time delay for the fold doublet. The top left panel\n2\nof Figure 2 shows \u2206\u03c4\u0302fold in units of \u03b8E\nas a function of u2 in units of \u03b8E , where \u03b8E is the Einstein angle of the lens. The\nanalytic and numerical results are in good agreement for sources within 0.05\u03b8E of the caustic, although the curves do begin to\ndiverge as u2 increases. The difference between the numerical and analytic curves (which represents the error in the analytic\napproximation, denoted by \u03b5) is shown in the middle left panel. The bottom left panel shows the logarithmic slope of the\nerror curve, d(ln \u03b5)/d(ln u2 ). Together, the middle and bottom left panels verify that our analytic approximation is accurate at\norder \u000f3/2 . Furthermore, these panels suggest that the next non-vanishing term is of order \u000f5/2 and has a positive coefficient.\nThe interesting implication is that the coefficient of the \u000f2 term seems to vanish. At our current order of approximation we\nare not able to determine whether this is rigorously true, and if so, how general it is; we merely offer the remark in the hope\nthat it may be useful for future analytic studies. For now, we focus on the verification that our analytic approximation is\naccurate at the order to which we work.\nSince the source position u2 is not observable, we compare the analytic and numerical time delays as a function of the\nimage separation d1 in the right-hand panels of Figure 2. The range of d1 corresponds to that used for u2 in the left-hand panels.\nFor a canonical fold lens with d1 = 0.46\u03b8E (Keeton et al. 2005), our analytic expression gives a very good approximation,\nindicating that our analysis can be applied in astrophysically relevant situations-not just when the source is asymptotically\nclose to the caustic, but even when it lies some small but finite distance away.\n\n4\n\nTHE CUSP CASE\n\nWe now apply our perturbative method to the case of a source near a cusp point. This approach has not been applied to\ncusp lenses before. Appendix A of Keeton et al. (2003) derives the image positions and magnifications for a cusp triplet\nassuming a simplified form of the lens equation. As we noted in Section 1, this simplified lens equation assumes that certain\nterms may be set to zero, using criteria that are less than rigorous. We use the lens equation derived from the fourth-order\nlens potential, and use perturbation theory to verify the results of Keeton et al. (2003) and extend the analysis to a higher\norder of approximation. We also study time delays for a cusp lens for the first time. Our analysis does not involve simplifying\nassumptions, and indicates that perturbation theory is a powerful method in the study of lensing.\n4.1\n\nImage Positions\n\nWe again expand the image positions, magnifications and time delays in the parameter \u000f, but with one notable difference.\nFor a cusp oriented in the u1 direction, a small \"horizontal\" displacement of \u000fu1 from the cusp point permits a \"vertical\"\ndisplacement of only \u000f3/2 u2 (see Fig. 1), since larger vertical displacements would imply a source position outside the caustic\n(Blandford & Narayan 1986).

The distance between any two images i and j is then\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\ndij = [\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b12 ]\u000f1/2 + O (\u000f) .\n4.2\n\n(40)\n\nMagnifications\n\nSubstituting our perturbative expressions for the image positions into equation (8), we find that the inverse magnification of\na cusp image is given by:\n\u03bc\u22121 = \u22122[gu1 + 3(g 2 + 2Kr)\u03b122 ] \u000f + [(24f r \u2212 12gp)\u03b123 + (6Kp \u2212 4f g)\u03b12 \u03b21 \u2212 (8g 2 + 24Kr)\u03b12 \u03b22 \u2212 gK\u03b31 ] \u000f3/2 + O (\u000f)2 .\n\n(41)\n\nWe then find from equation (2) that\nRcusp = 0 + O (\u000f) \u2248 Acusp d2 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere d = maxij dij is the largest separation between any two of the three cusp images. This expression shows that correction\nterms to the ideal cusp relation enter at second order in the image separation, which agrees with the conjecture of Keeton\net al. (2003). To see this, we define mi \u2261 |\u03bc\u22121\ni |, which allows us to write\nRcusp =\n\nmB mC \u2212 mA mC + mA mB\n.\nmB mC + mA mC + mA mB\n\n(43)\n\nIf the leading-order term in the numerator vanishes, so does the leading-order term in Rcusp . The zeroth-order term in Rcusp\ncorresponds to a term of O (\u000f)2 in the numerator, since the leading-order term in the denominator is O (\u000f)2 . By substituting\nthe solutions for \u03b12 into the numerator, we find that Rcusp = 0 to lowest order, in agreement with Keeton et al. (2003). We\nrepeat this procedure for the next-leading term of O (\u000f)5/2 in the numerator, and find that Rcusp = 0 at linear order in d [i.e.,\nO (\u000f)1/2 ] as well; this result was unattainable using the formalism of Keeton et al. (2003). To proceed to higher order, we\nmust extend our perturbative analysis by including terms of the form \u03b4i \u000f2 in equations (28) and (29) for the image positions.\nWe denote the coefficient of d2 by Acusp , which we do not here write down, since that would require several pages. Given the\ncomplexity of this term, it is not practical to evaluate Acusp analytically. However, we have numerically computed Rcusp for\nthe case of an SIE model with q = 0.5 (see Fig. 3) and find that Rcusp \u221d u1 \u221d d2 . While it is conceivable that Acusp might be\nzero for some specific lens model, clearly this is not the case in general. We have thus demonstrated analytically that Rcusp\nvanishes through linear order in d, placing the numerical result of Keeton et al. (2003) on solid mathematical ground.\n\n4.3\n\nTime Delays\n\nFor the cusp case, the scaled time delay takes the form\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002\n(\u03b81 \u2212 \u000fu1 )2 + (\u03b82 \u2212 \u000f3/2 u2 )2 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ).\n2\nWe find\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 2\n\u03c4\u0302 =\n(3g + 6Kr)\u03b124 + 2gu1 \u03b122 + (K \u2212 1)u21 \u000f2 + O (\u000f)5/2 ,\n2K\n\n\u03c4\u0302 =\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\n\fAnalytic Relations for Fold and Cusp Lenses\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.

This means that it\nis not possible to write our current expression strictly in terms of observables, such as the image separation. Instead, all we\ncan say is that the time delay scales quadratically with \u000f, or alternatively, with the fourth power of the image separation.\nIn the fold case, we found that the time delay scales as \u000f3/2 and only depends on the lens potential through the parameter\nh. For a cusp, however, h = 0, so it is not surprising that the lowest-order term in the time delay is of O (\u000f)2 . Furthermore, if\nwe had not included the \u03b3i \u000f3/2 terms in our expansions of the image positions for a cusp [equations (28] and [29)], it would not\nhave been possible to obtain a perturbative expression for the time delay; instead, we would simply have found \u03c4\u0302 = 0 + O (\u000f)2 .\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have developed a unified, rigorous framework for studying lensing near fold and cusp critical points, which can (in principle)\nbe extended to arbitrary order. We have found that the differential time delay of a fold pair assumes a particularly simple\nform, depending only on the image separation and the Taylor coefficient h = \u03c8222 (0)/6. This result is astrophysically relevant,\nsince it is quite accurate even for sources that are not asymptotically close to the caustic. We have also obtained perturbative\nexpressions for the image positions, magnifications and time delays of a cusp triplet. These results rest on the key insight that\na source at a given distance \u000f from a cusp along the relevant symmetry axis of the caustic can only move a perpendicular\ndistance of \u000f3/2 in order to remain inside the caustic (Blandford & Narayan 1986). We have shown rigorously that the distance\ndependence of the magnification ratio Rcusp conjectured by Keeton et al. (2003) is correct. We have also demonstrated that\nthe leading-order expression for the image positions is given by the relations presented by Keeton et al. (2003), and have\nprovided the necessary framework for deriving the image positions corresponding to a Taylor expansion of the lens potential\nat arbitrary truncation order. Finally, we have derived cusp time delays analytically for the first time. Our results provide a\nrigorous foundation for identifying anomalous flux ratios and time delays in gravitational lens systems, and for using them to\nstudy small-scale structure in the mass distributions of distant galaxies.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank A.
