Also the correct stoichiometry of\nthe samples, used in early investigations of LaTiO3,\nsometimes seems doubtful. Investigations at lower\nfrequencies, including the range of classical dielectric\nspectroscopy from Hz to MHz frequencies, are almost\ncompletely missing up to now. In ref. 23, very high values\nof the dielectric constant \u03b5' > 1000 were reported for high\ntemperatures, T > 600 K, but the intrinsic nature of these\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nAmong the perovskite-related transition-metal oxides,\nthat are in the focus of solid-state research since almost two\ndecades now, LaTiO3 is a prominent member and of high\ninterest for a variety of reasons: At first, LaTiO3 is a\nprototypical Mott-Hubbard insulator, which is just at the\nverge of a metal-insulator (MI) transition, becoming\nmetallic already at very low doping levels.1 2 3 This notion4\nwas corroborated by a variety of experimental\ninvestigations,2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 with optical spectroscopy of\nelectronic excitations playing a leading role.5 6 7 8 9 10 Very\nrecently, renewed interest in LaTiO3 arose due to\nexperimental observations11 and theoretical interpretations12\n13\nof the ground-state properties in terms of an \"orbitalliquid\" state, involving the dynamical quenching of the\norbital moments in LaTiO3. The orbital degrees of freedom\nare nowadays understood to play a crucial role for the\nelectronic and magnetic properties of many transition metal\noxides. While the existence of an orbital-liquid state in\nLaTiO3 is still a matter of controversy,11 12 14 15 16 17 it is clear\nthat the disclosure of the orbital ground state in LaTiO3 is a\nhighly relevant and complex problem, both, experimentally\nand theoretically. Closely connected to this topic is also the\nquestion of a structural phase transition, which, via the JTeffect, accompanies possible orbital order and may occur\nsimultaneously with the antiferromagnetic ordering at\nTN \u2248 146 K. Recent experimental findings indeed revealed\nsome hints for structural anomalies at TN.16 17 Finally,\nLaTiO3, can be expected to exhibit also interesting dielectric\nproperties: Within the well-known La1-xAxTiO3 (A = Ba or\nSr) phase diagrams,3 18 the compositions with x = 1 show\n\n1\n\n\fresults is not clear as contact effects may also lead to\napparently high dielectric constants.24\nIn the present work we provide spectra of the ac\nconductivity \u03c3' and dielectric constant \u03b5' of singlecrystalline LaTiO3 over an overall frequency range of 17\ndecades, from 10 mHz to 1000 THz. This is achieved by\ncombining results from classical dielectric and coaxialreflection spectroscopy, as well as from quasi-optic mmwave and IR spectroscopy. The measurements were\nperformed from room temperature down to 6K and for two\ndifferent crystallographic directions. The samples used in\nthis work are very close to ideal stoichiometry, especially\nconcerning the oxygen content, where already slight\ndeviations can lead to significant free-carrier contributions.1\nOne of the aims of the low-frequency (\u03bd < 2 GHz)\nmeasurements, performed in this work, is to determine the\nintrinsic dielectric constant at frequencies below the phonon\nmodes, which is caused by the ionic and electronic\npolarizability. Another important point is the clarification of\nthe role of Anderson localization in LaTiO3. While the MottHubbard- or Charge-Transfer-insulator scenario nowadays is\nused as standard interpretation of the non-metallic behavior\nof various transition-metal oxides, the importance of\nAnderson-localization is often neglected. Via a\ncharacteristic frequency dependence of the conductivity\nbelow GHz, it was demonstrated that in many\nsemiconducting or insulating transition-metal oxides,\nincluding high-Tc related materials and colossalmagnetoresistance manganates, hopping conduction of\nAnderson-localized charge carriers plays an important role\n(see, e.g., refs. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29). It seems that even for\nundoped materials, small inevitable deviations from\nstoichiometry can generate sufficient disorder to lead to\nAnderson localization.25 26 27\nOur measurements in the FIR region aim at the precise\ndetermination of the temperature-dependent phononic\nexcitations in order to check for possible structural\nanomalies at TN. First results have already been published in\nref. 16. Furthermore, the comparison of the dielectric\nconstant in the FIR region and the GHz region should allow\nto conclude for the origin \u2013 either ionic or electronic \u2013 of the\nintrinsic dielectric constant observed in dielectric\nspectroscopy. In addition, it is of interest to clarify the\ncontribution from charge transport to the frequencydependent conductivity in the low FIR region by\ncomparison to the results from dielectric spectroscopy and\nmeasurements in the mm-wave range. For the description of\nthis region, in earlier literature a background contribution\nfrom free-carrier Drude-behavior was evoked,5 8 21 22\nhowever, the samples used in these investigations can be\nsuspected to have been slightly off-stoichiometric. Finally,\nwe intend to obtain information about the gap-like\nexcitations in the region beyond the phonon modes,\nincluding its so far only rarely investigated temperature\ndependence. Special emphasis will be paid to the onset of\nthe interband conductivity. A soft-edge behavior is expected\nfor a Mott-Hubbard insulator, while a Slater antiferromagnet\nwould produce a sharply rising conductivity at the band\nedge.30\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nSingle crystals of LaTiO3 were prepared by floating-zone\nmelting as described in detail in ref. 1. Some of the crystals\nwere untwinned and these were used for the measurements.\nThe oxygen content was determined by thermogravimetry,\nyielding a stoichiometry of La:Ti:O like 1:1:2.99. The x-ray\npattern at room temperature revealed an orthorhombic\nstructure (Pbnm, z = 4) with the lattice parameters a = 5.633,\nb = 5.617, c = 7.915 \u00c5. The Neel temperature of LaTiO3\ndepends sensitively on the oxygen content. The TN = 146 K\nof our samples is among the highest reported in literature,16\na fingerprint for crystals very close to ideal stoichiometry.\nThe same can be said for the low dc-conductivity,16 as\ndeviations from stoichiometry drive the Mott-Hubbard\ninsulator towards a more metallic state. For the\nmeasurements of the present work, several platelets were cut\nfrom the same melt-grown rod. From x-ray and thermal\nexpansion measurements performed on platelets cut in the\nsame direction,16 the crystallographic a-axis was deduced to\nbe perpendicular to the sample surface. The IR\nmeasurements were performed in reflection geometry on a\npolished platelet with an area of about 3x3mm and 1mm\nthickness, the electric field being oriented perpendicular to\nthe a-axis. For the measurements from dc to 2 GHz smaller\nplatelets were covered with two silver-paint contacts in\nsandwich and coplanar geometry, thus enabling\nmeasurements parallel and perpendicular to the a-axis.\nThe dc conductivity was measured with a standard fourpoint technique, employing an electrometer. The ac\nelectrical response from 20 Hz to 1 MHz, was determined\nusing an autobalance bridge (HP4284A LCR-meter). At\ntemperatures below 60 K, additional measurements down to\n10-2 Hz were performed using a frequency-response\nanalyzer (Novocontrol \u03b1-analyzer). In all these\nmeasurements, for cooling, the samples were mounted in a\n4\nHe-bath cryostat. In the radio to microwave regime, a\nreflectometric technique employing an impedance analyzer\n(Agilent 4291A, 1 MHz \u2013 1.8 GHz) was used, the sample\nshorting the inner and outer conductor at the end of a coaxial\nline.31 For cooling, the end of the coaxial line was connected\nto the cold head of a closed-cycle refrigerator, allowing\nmeasurements down to 30 K. For measurements below\nabout 100 K, an open/short compensation has been\nperformed at low temperatures to eliminate an influence of\nslight temperature-dependent changes of line and sample\nholder. In the IR regime the temperature-dependent\nreflectivity R was determined using two Fourier-transform\nspectrometers (Bruker IFS 113v and IFS66v/S). A spectral\nrange from 80 cm-1 (\u2248 2.4 THz) to 25000 cm-1 (\u2248 740 THz)\nwas covered utilizing a suitable set of sources,\nbeamsplitters, windows, and detectors; reference\nmeasurements were performed with a gold mirror at\n\u03bd <16000 cm-1 and an aluminum mirror at higher\nfrequencies. In addition, in regions of small reflectivity, the\nbackground reflectivity due to cryostat windows and\nunwanted reflections within the spectrometer was taken into\naccount by making a correction using the measurement\nresults of a zero-reflectivity sample. Cooling down to 6 K\nwas achieved by a 4He-bath cryostat. Spectra of \u03c3' and \u03b5'\n\n2\n\n\frange investigated for selected temperatures and with the\nelectric field E\u22a5a. For frequencies \u03bd < 2 GHz,\nmeasurements were performed also for E||a revealing a\nqualitatively similar behavior.33 The spectra show a rich\nvariety of features that will be treated in the following\nchapters.\n\nwere calculated from the measured reflectivity and the phase\nshift, which was calculated via a Kramers-Kronig (KK)\ntransformation. The required low-frequency extrapolation\nwas based on the measured dielectric data, while at high\nfrequencies a \u03bd-1.55 power law extrapolation was found to\nmatch the experimental data best. To check for the behavior\nin the frequency gap between the highest frequency of the\ncoaxial measurements (1.8 GHz) and the lowest FIR\nfrequency (2.4 THz), additional transmission measurements\nwere carried out in the mm-wave region using a quasi-optic\nspectrometer in Mach-Zehnder configuration.32 It allows for\nthe measurement of transmittance and phase shift, thus\navoiding the necessity of a KK transformation. Using this\nsetup, measurements at 145 GHz were performed between 5\nand 300 K.\n\n3.1 Electrode Effects vs. Intrinsic Contributions\nIn Fig. 1a, at low frequencies, a plateau shows up in\n\u03c3'(\u03bd), which is most pronounced for the higher\ntemperatures. At T \u2265 35 K, this plateau is interrupted by a\nsmall step-like increase (e.g., at about 105 Hz for 130 K),\nwhich shifts towards higher frequencies with increasing\ntemperature. It is quite smeared out at T \u2264 52 K, due to the\nfurther increase of \u03c3'(\u03bd), as discussed below. In addition, at\n300 K a significant offset between the LCR-meter and\nimpedance-analyzer results shows up at 1 MHz. The solid\ncircles in Fig. 1a indicate the dc conductivity, obtained from\na four-point measurement. Obviously, the conductivity\nvalues detected at the lowest frequencies of the ac\nmeasurements are lower than those of the four-point\nmeasurement.\nThis\nindicates\nsignificant\ncontact\ncontributions leading to an apparently lowered conductivity\nin the two-point ac-measurements. Metal-semiconductor\ncontacts often exhibit high ohmic resistances, accompanied\nby a high capacitance due to the formation of a depletion\nlayer at the metal-to-semiconductor interface.34 They usually\ncan be modeled by a parallel RC-circuit, connected in series\nto the bulk sample, thus leading to the equivalent circuit\nindicated in Fig. 1b.24,27 At high frequencies, the contact\nresistor becomes shortened by the contact capacitance and\nthe intrinsic bulk response is detected. This causes the\nsmooth step-like increase of \u03c3'(\u03bd), observed at the higher\ntemperatures. Indeed, the values reached by \u03c3' beyond the\nstep agree well with the results from the dc measurement\n(Fig. 1a). The observed shift of the steps with temperature\ncan be understood taking into account the temperaturedependence of the circuit's time constant, which is mainly\ndetermined by the semiconducting characteristics of the\nsample resistance.24 At 6 K, the step has shifted out of the\nfrequency window and intrinsic behavior prevails for the\ncomplete curve. The mentioned offset at 1 MHz in the\n300 K spectrum mirrors the fact that two crystals with\ndifferent geometry were used for the low and highfrequency measurements. Thus the differing contact\nresistance leads to the observed offset, showing up in the\nnon-intrinsic region of \u03c3'(\u03bd). For the lower temperatures, the\nmerging-frequency of both methods is located beyond the\nfrequency of the contact-step (which has shifted to lower\nfrequencies), i.e. in the intrinsic region and thus no offset is\nobserved. In \u03b5'(\u03bd) (Fig. 1b), the high contact capacitance\nleads to apparently huge values of the dielectric constant in\nthe contact-dominated region. Only at high frequencies the\nintrinsic \u03b5' is observed. To check for the validity of the\ninterpretation outlined above, we have carried out a leastsquare fit of the spectra at 130 K using the equivalent circuit\nshown in Fig. 1b. To take account of the high-frequency\nincrease of \u03c3'(\u03bd), for the bulk response an additional\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFIG. 1. Frequency-dependent conductivity (a) and dielectric\nconstant (b) of LaTiO3 for selected temperatures and field direction\nE\u22a5a in the complete frequency range investigated. For clarity\nreasons, in the IR region the results are shown for 6 K only. The\ndashed and dotted lines in (a) indicate the UDR and SLPL,\nrespectively, for the lowest temperatures. The dotted line in (b)\nindicates the intrinsic \u03b5\u221e. The solid lines through the 130 K curves\nare the results of a fit performed simultaneously for \u03c3'(\u03bd) and \u03b5'(\u03bd),\nusing the equivalent circuit indicated in (b) with the bulk\ncontribution including the sum of UDR and SLPL behavior. The\ndashed line in (b) shows the intrinsic bulk contribution for 130 K.\nThe inset compares the dielectric constant measured for E\u22a5a and\nE||a at two temperatures.\n\nIn Fig. 1 the spectra of the conductivity and dielectric\nconstant of LaTiO3 are shown in the complete frequency\n\n3\n\n\ffrequency-dependent term was included, as described in\nsection 3.3. The results of the fit, performed simultaneously\nfor \u03c3' and \u03b5', are shown as solid lines in Figs. 1a and b. A\nreasonable agreement of experimental data and fit can be\nstated. With Rdc \u2248 120 k\u03a9 and Rc \u2248 180 k\u03a9 the fit reveals\nquite similar magnitudes of dc resistance and contact\nresistance. In contrast, the thin depletion layer corresponds\nto a contact capacitance Cc \u2248 24 pF, much larger than the\nintrinsic capacitance of Ci \u2248 0.16 pF. In comparison to the\nfit, the step in \u03b5'(\u03bd) appears somewhat smeared out. This\nfinding may be attributed to the roughness of the sample\nsurface, leading to a distribution of time constants of the\ncircuit. At 300 K, even an indication of two successive\ncontact steps shows up, the origin of which is unclear.\n\ntunneling distance. Thus the smaller tunneling distance for\nE\u22a5a probably leads to the detected enhancement of the\nconductivity in this direction.\n\n3.2 Dc Conductivity\nThe plateau value, reached by \u03c3'(\u03bd) at frequencies\nbeyond the contact step (e.g. at 106 Hz for 130 K), can be\nidentified by the intrinsic dc conductivity \u03c3dc. In Fig. 2,\n\u03c3dc(T) determined from the \u03c3'(\u03bd) spectra is shown for both\nfield directions. In addition, the solid line denotes the result\nof the dc four-point measurement with E\u22a5a, revealing a\nreasonable agreement with \u03c3dc from the ac measurement.\nBoth, an Arrhenius plot and a representation that should\nlinearize the data for a behavior \u03c3' ~ exp(-T0/T)1/4 are given.\nThe latter is predicted for variable range hopping (VRH),\ninvolving the phonon-assisted tunneling of Andersonlocalized electrons or holes.35\nObviously, the dc\nconductivity of LaTiO3 does not exhibit simple thermally\nactivated behavior over any significant temperature range. A\ntemperature-dependent scattering, e.g. at spin-fluctuations\nwhen approaching the antiferromagnetic transition, can be\nsuspected to cause this behavior. At TN = 146 K (indicated\nby arrows), \u03c3dc(T) exhibits a point of inflection. As already\nspeculated in ref. 16, this anomaly may be attributed to\norbital fluctuations in the vicinity of an orbital-order\ntransition accompanying the magnetic order at TN. At\nT < 100 K, the straight dashed lines demonstrate that VRH\nof Anderson-localized charge carriers dominates the charge\ntransport at low temperatures. We obtain values of T0 =\n1.0\u00d7108 K (E||a) and T0 = 8.6\u00d7107 K (E\u22a5a), which is of\nsimilar magnitude as observed in various other transition\nmetal oxides.27 36 37 Interestingly, \u03c3dc for the two field\ndirections shows a considerable anisotropy, which changes\nsign at about 60 K (1000/T \u2248 17). In ref. 16, from x-ray\ndiffraction and thermal-expansion measurements it was\ndeduced that in the orthorhombic structure of LaTiO3 the\nlattice parameter a is larger than b and c 2 at all\ntemperatures T < 300 K. It was assumed that the detected\nenlargement of this difference at TN is connected with\nferrodistortive orbital order of dumbbell-shaped orbitals (\"plike\") within the ab plane. At high temperatures, the higher\n\u03c3dc for E||a documented in Fig. 2 may mirror an anisotropy\nin the intersite transfer matrix element that is influenced by\norbital-order correlations with a dominant component in adirection. In contrast at low temperatures, where tunneling\nprevails, the hopping probability mainly depends on the\n\nFIG. 2. Temperature-dependent dc conductivity of LaTiO3 for\nboth investigated field directions. The data are given in an\nArrhenius (lower scale) and a VRH representation (upper scale).\nThe solid lines are the results from a dc fourpoint measurement and\nthe symbols were determined from the ac measurements of Fig. 1.\nThe dashed lines indicate VRH behavior for T < 100 K. The dashdotted line was calculated with an energy barrier of 65 meV, as\ndetermined from the evaluation of the gap feature in the IR region.\n\n3.3 Ac Conductivity and Universal Power Laws\nFollowing the intrinsic dc-plateau, \u03c3'(\u03bd) starts to rise\ncontinuously with increasing frequency (Fig. 1a). At the\nlowest temperatures, where contact step and dc plateau no\nlonger contribute, this increase is revealed to be composed\nof two power laws, namely a sublinear increase \u03c3' ~ \u03bds, s < 1\n(dashed line), extending over about 8 frequency decades and\na superlinear power law, \u03c3' ~ \u03bdn, n > 1 (dotted line). Taking\ninto account the mm-wave and FIR results, the latter seems\nto extend well up to the low-frequency edge of the phonon\nregion. For low temperatures, values of s \u2248 0.79 and n \u2248 1.4\nare deduced.\nA sublinear power law, \u03c3' ~ \u03bds corresponds to the socalled \"Universal Dielectric Response\" (UDR), which was\ndemonstrated by Jonscher34 38 to be a universal feature in the\ndielectric response of disordered matter. For conducting\nmaterials, it is commonly ascribed to the hopping of\nAnderson-localized charge carriers. There is a variety of\ntheoretical approaches that deduce this behavior from the\nmicroscopic transport mechanisms, involving hopping over\nor tunneling through an energy barrier, separating different\nlocalized sites.39 A value of s \u2248 0.8, as found here for\nLaTiO3 at 6 K, is typical for the ac-response of the VRH\ntheory,35 39 thus the ac results being in good accord with the\nVRH behavior revealed by the dc conductivity (Fig. 2). A\nprerequisite for Anderson-localization is the presence of\ndisorder, as prevailing, e.g., in amorphous or doped\nsemiconductors. Obviously, in pure, single-crystalline\nLaTiO3, marginal disorder, e.g. a slight off-stoichiometry of\n\n4\n\n\fthe oxygen content or impurities at a ppm level, suffices to\nlocalize the charge carriers, so that the UDR and VRH can\nbe observed. Also for other undoped transition-metal oxides,\ne.g. La2CuO4 (ref. 26) or LaMnO3,27 the presence of\nAnderson localization was revealed by ac-conductivity\nmeasurements. Via the KK transformation and the relation\n\u03b5' ~ \u03c3\"/\u03bd, the UDR can be deduced to contribute also to the\nfrequency-dependent dielectric constant, namely with a term\n\u03b5' ~ \u03bds-1 (ref. 34). The dashed line in Fig. 1b shows the\nintrinsic part of the fit of the 130 K curve. It includes the\nUDR contribution and the dielectric constant from ionic and\nelectronic polarization processes (sect. 3.4). Obviously, the\nonset of the step-like increase of \u03b5'(\u03bd) towards low\nfrequencies is dominated by the intrinsic contribution from\ncharge carrier hopping.\nThe origin of the superlinear power law (SLPL),\nobserved at frequencies beyond the UDR regime and\nbridging the gap to the IR region is unknown up to now. In\nref. 40, it is proposed that this contribution may be a\nuniversal feature of all disordered matter and indeed it is\nobserved for such different classes of materials as doped\n36 41\nsemiconductors,27\nsupercooled liquids,42 and ionic\n43\nconductors. It should be noted that the observed SLPL\nwould be difficult to explain in terms of photon-assisted\nhopping, which was recently invoked for the explanation of\nthe approximately linear or even quadratic frequency\ndependence of \u03c3'(\u03bd), observed in various semiconductors at\nlow temperatures and high frequencies.44 A transition from\nphonon- to photon-assisted hopping should occur for\nh\u03bd > kBT, a condition that clearly is not fulfilled for most of\nthe regions where the SLPL is observed in the present work.\nAs seen in Fig. 1a, at the higher temperatures it is\ndifficult to separate the UDR and the SLPL contribution to\n\u03c3'(\u03bd), a fact that prevents a precise determination of the\nUDR exponent s. However, even at 130 K, it is not possible\nto describe the very smooth transition from the dc plateau to\nthe SLPL without invoking an UDR contribution. This was\nchecked by omitting the UDR in the fit performed for this\ntemperature, which led to an unsatisfactory description of\nthe transition region. At higher temperatures, missing data in\nthe transition region do not allow for a conclusion on the\npresence of a UDR contribution. As mentioned, the SLPL\nextends well to the phonon modes. Thus, there is no\nindication of a Drude-contribution of free charge carriers, in\ncontrast to the assumptions in some earlier works.5 8 21 22 The\nfound SLPL is of high relevance for the low-frequency\nextrapolation of IR-reflection data, that is necessary for the\ncalculation of the conductivity via the KK transformation.\nObviously, the standard extrapolations often employed,\nnamely a constant extrapolation or an extrapolation\nassuming the Hagen-Rubens limit, are not valid, at least in\nthe case of LaTiO3. In the present work, instead the SLPL\nwas used.\n\nvalue matches reasonably with the results from the mmwave experiment at 145 GHz and with the value read off at\nthe low-frequency edge of the FIR spectrum. Interestingly,\nfor E||a a significantly higher value of \u03b5\u221e = 44 (\u00b12) is\nobserved (inset of Fig. 1). In this region, contact effects,\norientational polarization and charge transport no longer\ncontribute to \u03b5' and its value is determined by the ionic and\nelectronic polarizability only. The measured IR spectrum of\n\u03b5' for \u0395\u22a5a allows for a separation of both contributions: In\nFig. 1b, \u03b5'(\u03bd) is seen to drop from 20 to a value of about 2\nalready in the phonon region thus revealing the almost\ncompletely ionic origin of the observed \u03b5\u221e. Concerning the\nobserved anisotropy, it most likely arises due to a higher\nionic polarizability of the titanium ion along a. In ref. 17, an\nelongation of the basal plane of the TiO6 octahedra along a\nwas deduced from diffraction measurements and assumed to\nimply ferrodistortive orbital order. Thus a higher\npolarizability in the anisotropically deformed octahedron\nalong the a-direction would be expected. On the other hand,\na strong electronic contribution to the higher \u03b5\u221e for E||a\ncannot be fully excluded. The electronic contribution is\nexpected to become large on the approach of the insulatormetal transition from the insulating side.46 The observed\nanisotropy then could indicate that LaTiO3 is closer to the\ninsulator-metal transition for E||a, in accord with the higher\ndc conductivity for this field direction (Fig. 2). However,\noverall it seems unlikely that, while \u03b5\u221e for \u0395\u22a5a is almost\ncompletely determined by ionic polarization, the increase of\n\u03b5\u221e for E||a should arise from electronic polarization, which\nwould imply that electronic polarization plays a significant\nrole for E||a only.\nAt this point it seems appropriate to make some\nfundamental remarks on the coexistence of polar and\nmagnetic order.47 Compounds with an empty d-shell, e.g.\nBaTiO3 (Ti4+: d0) reveal polar order and of course exhibit no\nlong-range magnetic order. Compounds with a partly filled\nd-shell, e.g. LaTiO3 (Ti3+: d1) reveal magnetic but no polar\norder. Obviously the partly filled d-orbitals hamper the\nstrong static or dynamic ionic polarization effects that often\ndrive polar order. However, the remaining strong anisotropy\nin the polarization effects, as observed in LaTiO3 must\nstrictly be correlated with the occupancy of the orbitals and\nthe orbital order.\n3.5 Phonon Modes\nIn cubic perovskites, ABO3, there are three IR-active\nphonon modes: With increasing frequency the external,\nbending, and stretching modes successively appear in the\nspectra They are ascribed to the vibration of the BO6\noctahedra against the A ions, the bending of the Ti-O bondangle, and the variation of the B-O bond length,\nrespectively. For an orthorhombically distorted perovskite,\nlike LaTiO3, factor group analysis predicts a splitting of\neach of these modes into five IR-active modes and the\nappearance of four additional bending modes, which are\ninactive in the cubic case.48 49 In addition, six new modes\nshould arise in the IR spectra due to the orthorhombic\ndistortion, making a total of 25 IR-active phonons. As\n\n3.4 Dielectric Constant Due to Ionic and Electronic\nPolarization\nIn Fig. 1b, at the high-frequency plateau of \u03b5'(\u03bd) an\nintrinsic \u03b5' of \u03b5\u221e = 20 (\u00b12) can be read off for E\u22a5a.45 This\n\n5\n\n\fLaTiO3 is quite close to cubic, the splitting of the cubic\nmodes and the amplitude of the new modes can be expected\nto be weak and indeed in earlier works, only few of the\nexpected 25 modes could be resolved.6 10 21 22 The only work\nproviding temperature-dependent data in the FIR region to\nour knowledge is ref. 6, but unfortunately the authors do not\nprovide any analysis of the observed phonon modes.\n\ndistortion. In agreement with ref. 22, the center group at\n340 cm-1 seems to be split into a larger number of submodes than those at 170 and 540 cm-1 as it is indeed\nexpected for a bending mode.48 In Fig. 3b a fit of the\nreflectance spectrum at 6 K is shown, using the sum of\nseveral Lorentz-oscillators. At 6 K, at least 17 oscillators are\nnecessary to achieve a reasonable fit of the experimental\ndata. At high temperatures the number of Lorentz functions\nwas reduced, reaching 13 at room temperature, as here the\nmodes become broadened and some of the smaller peaks are\nno longer resolved. In ref. 21, nine separate modes could be\ndiscerned, while in other works only the three main modes\nof the cubic case were analyzed.10 22 Table 1 denotes the\nresonance frequencies \u03bd0 and amplitudes \u2206\u03b5 as resulting\nfrom the fits for 6 K and room temperature. While the fit in\nFig. 3b looks reasonable, some details of the experimental\nspectrum are not quite reproduced.\n\n6K\n\u03bd0(cm-1)\n123.5\n169.0\n178.6\n195.0\n248.4\n264.1\n305.6\n316.1\n348.4\n368.2\n384.3\n388.0\n419.0\n429.2\n467.7\n502.1\n552.9\n\nFIG. 3.

A large number of different modes with a\nsignificant temperature dependence of their amplitudes and\nfrequency positions can be discerned. In Fig. 3c the\nconductivity at 6 K, obtained from R via a KK\ntransformation is shown. Comparing Figs. 3a and c it\nbecomes obvious that the mode position and relative\namplitude, estimated from the R representation, can be\nmisleading. For example the modes around 400 cm-1 appear\nstrong in the R representation but reveal a low amplitude in\nthe \u03c3 representation. However, one has to be aware that the\nKK transformation can introduce some uncertainty into the\nconductivity spectra and often it may be preferable to\nanalyze the raw reflectance data. The observed phonon\nmodes can be roughly divided into three groups centered at\nabout 170, 340, and 540 cm-1.

Resonance frequencies \u03bd0 and amplitudes \u2206\u03b5 from a\nfit of the reflectance in the phonon region using a sum of Lorentz\noscillators for 6 and 300 K.\n\nThis drawback may be overcome by using more\noscillators in the fits, but already with 17 oscillators the\nproblem arises that the parameters are correlated to some\nextent. The main aim of the FIR investigations of the present\nwork is the search for possible small anomalies in the\ntemperature dependence of the phonon modes, giving hints\nto a possible structural phase transition. The mentioned\ncorrelation of parameters, together with the uncertainties due\nto the KK transformation, renders it difficult to gain such\ninformation from the fits. Namely these problems reduce the\nprecision of the parameters to an extent that the small\n\n6\n\n\fchanges at a possible phase transition may not be caught.\nThus it seems most appropriate to perform a direct\ninspection of the raw reflection and conductivity data for\nsuch anomalies. One example is given in Fig. 4, where a\ndetailed view of the mode at 340 cm-1 is given for various\ntemperatures (for clarity reasons, spectra are shown only for\nselected temperatures). The inset shows the temperaturedependent frequency of the peak maximum, \u03bd0, read off\nfrom the \u03c3'(\u03bd) curves. While at low temperatures, up to\nabout 150 K, \u03bd0 is effectively constant, at higher\ntemperatures a significant shift towards lower frequencies is\nobserved. A similar characteristic is revealed by the peaks\nclose to 175, 195, and 535 cm-1 (not shown) with the\ntransition from constant to temperature-dependent \u03bd0(T)\nalways lying in the range of 110-150 K. One may speculate\nthat this behavior mirrors the fact, that the lattice constants\nare nearly constant at T < 100 K, but b increases\nconsiderable at T > 150 K, both a and b exhibiting a\nsmeared-out anomaly close to TN.16 This finding was\ninterpreted as evidence for a structural phase transition at\nTN.16 Then the variation of the orthorhombic lattice\ndistortion at high temperatures, inducing a variation of\nsplitting of the cubic modes, may lead to the observed shift\nof the phonon frequencies at T > TN. This implies that the\nmodes at 175, 195, 340, and 535 cm-1, which show evidence\nof this anomaly, belong to the split cubic modes, which\nseems reasonable (compare Fig. 3c). However, one should\nbe aware that anharmonic effects would lead to quite a\nsimilar temperature dependence of phonon modes, namely\nan increase of \u03bd0 towards lower temperatures and a\nsaturation at low temperatures.\n\nto avoid any uncertainty due to the KK transformation, in\nFig. 5 the reflection raw data are plotted. The spectra reveal\nthe appearance of two additional peaks at 373 and 424 cm-1,\nshowing up just at temperatures below TN. This finding\ngives further strong evidence for a structural anomaly\naccompanying the magnetic phase transition at TN as\npromoted in refs. 16 and 17. The increase of the difference\nof lattice constants a and b at TN, found in ref. 16, can be\ninterpreted as an increase of orthorhombic distortion, which\nat T < TN gives rise to an increase of the amplitude of\nmodes, invisible in the less distorted case at T > TN.\n\nFIG. 5. Frequency-dependent reflectivity of LaTiO3 at the\ngroup of phonon modes around 400 cm-1 for various temperatures.\n\n3.6 Electronic Excitations\n3.6.1 Dynamic conductivity\nFigure 6 shows the conductivity at the highest\nfrequencies investigated, including the last phonon mode. At\nfrequencies beyond the phononic contributions, \u03c3'(\u03bd)\nexhibits the typical signature of an electronic excitation\nacross an energy gap. Namely, after dropping to very low\nvalues, below the detection limit, it shows a steep increase\nwith an onset close to 700 cm-1, followed by a saturation\nabove about 3000 cm-1. In accord with previous\ninterpretations,6 7 8 9 10 this gaplike feature can be ascribed to\na transition between the lower and upper Hubbard bands in\nthe typical Mott-Hubbard insulator LaTiO3. The inset of Fig.\n6 shows the results of Fujishima et al.5, which extend\nbeyond the highest frequencies investigated in the present\nwork.50 They reveal another much stronger excitation with\nan onset at about 3\u00d7104 cm-1, which was interpreted as\ncharge-transfer transition between the O 2p and Ti 3d\nbands.5 7 10 In refs. 6, 7, 9, and 10, a quantitative evaluation\nof the Mott-Hubbard gap energy Eg was performed by using\na simple linear extrapolation in the \u03c3'(\u03bd) plot. Roomtemperature values of Eg = 20 meV,6 0.1 eV,7 10 and 0.2 eV9\nwere reported, the variation reflecting uncertainties due to\nthe choice of the section of the spectrum used for the\nextrapolation and possible differences of stoichiometry of\nthe samples. Only in ref. 6, temperature-dependent\n\nFIG. 4. Frequency-dependent conductivity of LaTiO3 around\nthe phonon mode at 340 cm-1 for selected temperatures. The inset\nshows the temperature-dependence of the peak position \u03bd0, with the\nlines indicating a change of characteristics close to TN.\n\nFig. 5 demonstrates further anomalies of the phonon\nmodes close to TN that occur around 350-430 cm-1. In this\nregion already Crandles et al.,21 despite a reduced resolution\nof the spectra, found indications for two modes at 380 and\n411 cm-1, which they considered as the F2u modes of the\ncubic lattice, i.e. additional bending modes becoming IR\nactive in the orthorhombic case. As the phonon resonances\nin this region have very low amplitude (cf. Fig. 3c), in order\n\n7\n\n\fexperimental results using \u03c3' ~ (\u03bd\u2212Eg)3/2/\u03bd, which describes\ndirect forbidden transitions.51 It is interesting to compare\nthis frequency dependence of the conductivity derived for\noptical transitions in conventional semiconductors with\npredictions for strongly correlated electron systems. In a\nclassical paper on the optical energy gap in V2O3,30 a \"softedge\" behavior has been reported with \u03c3' ~ (\u03bd-Eg)3/2 and has\nbeen described as a hallmark of strong electron correlations.\nSpecifically it has been pointed out that this behavior clearly\ndiffers from the conductivity of a Slater antiferromagnet,\nwhich would produce a conductivity that rises sharply with\n\u03bd1/2. One should note that for \u03bd-Eg << Eg, (\u03bd\u2212Eg)3/2/\u03bd is\napproximately equal to (\u03bd\u2212Eg)3/2/Eg. Thus for frequencies\njust above the onset of the interband transition, the\nconductivity predicted for an electronically correlated\nsystem is identical to that for a direct-forbidden transition in\na canonical semiconductor and deviations are expected for\nhigher frequencies only.\n\nmeasurements were reported for four different temperatures,\nthe gap energies varying between about 20 meV at 300 K\nand 50 meV at 20 K. To obtain more precise information on\nthe temperature-dependent gap energies and to use a less\nambiguous way of extrapolation, here we analyzed the\nspectra in the gap region within simple models based on\nFermi's golden rule. As noted in textbooks,35 51 assuming\nparabolic and three-dimensional bands, the frequencydependent conductivity in the gap region can be calculated.\nIt is predicted to show significantly different characteristics\nfor the cases of direct and indirect and for quantummechanically allowed and forbidden transitions. Namely, a\nplot of (\u03c3'\u00d7\u03bd)n with n = 2, 2/3, 1/2, and 1/3 should linearize\nfor direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed, and\nindirect forbidden transitions, respectively, and an\nextrapolation to an ordinate value of zero should allow to\nread off the gap energy. Checking these representations\nreveals the case of a direct forbidden transition best\ndescribing the experimental data.33 Fig. 7 shows the\ncorresponding plot for 6 K. The finding of the forbidden\nnature of the observed transition is reasonable following the\ncommon notion6 7 8 9 10 that it occurs between the lower and\nupper Hubbard bands. Making the assumption that the\ntransition takes place within the t2g band, split by the\nHubbard energy U, the selection rule \u2206l = \u00b11 would be\nbroken. However, this argument possibly is too naive for\nstrongly correlated electron systems. A fit to the data\nanalyzing the results up to 2000 cm-1 yields\nEg = 570 cm-1 \u2248 71 meV, a rather small value compared to\nthe Hubbard U that is usually assumed to be of the order of\nfew eV.\n\nFIG. 7. Frequency-dependent conductivity of LaTiO3 at 6 K,\nplotted in a way to linearize the data in the region of the electronic\ngap excitation for the case of a direct forbidden transition. The\nupper inset demonstrates the extrapolation, performed to determine\nthe gap energies, for three selected temperatures. The lower inset\nshows the temperature-dependent gap energy; the line is drawn to\nguide the eye.\n\nThe lower inset of Fig. 7 shows Eg(T) determined\nassuming a direct forbidden transition using the\nexperimental results below 1000 cm-1 (see solid lines in the\nupper inset). The gap energy reveals a significant\ntemperature dependence: On decreasing temperature it\ndecreases from about 65 meV at room temperature to\n45 meV at TN, where it undergoes a step-like increase to a\nlow-temperature value of 55 meV. The increase at TN could\nbe understood in terms of the magnetic exchange energy J,\nwhich is of the order of TN. However, the decrease below\nroom temperature can only be understood in terms of\nstructural effects, e.g. lattice expansion or dynamical JahnTeller effects. And hence, also the increase of TN could be\ndue to structural effects only. In this context we would like\nto recall that an orbital-ordering transition has be reported to\noccur at TN.16 In their investigation of the Mott-Hubbard gap\n\nFIG. 6. Frequency-dependent conductivity of LaTiO3 at\nfrequencies beyond the phonon modes for two temperatures. The\ninset shows the results at room temperature reported by Fujishima\net al.5\n\n3.6.2 Energy gap and \"soft-edge\" behavior\nIn the upper inset of Fig. 7, a closer view of the region\nclose to the gap energy is given for three temperatures,\nrevealing significant temperature dependence. To investigate\nthe temperature dependence of the gap, we analyzed the\n\n8\n\n\fin the system LaxY1-xTiO3, Okimoto et al.9 found a\nsystematic increase of Eg with Y-content. From calculations\nusing a tight binding model they concluded that this\nbehavior is due to a decrease of the one-electron bandwidth\ninduced by an increase of orthorhombic distortion. Thus the\nsudden increase of Eg when entering the antiferromagnetic\nstate, observed in the lower inset of Fig. 7, may also be\nascribed to the increase of orthorhombicity below TN.16\nThe measured dc-conductivity (Fig. 2) allows us to\nclarify the importance of the observed gap for the charge\ntransport in LaTiO3. The dash-dotted line in Fig. 2 indicates\nthermally activated behavior, \u03c3' ~ exp[-Eg/(kBT)] with Eg\n= 65 meV, the value determined from the optic experiments\nat room temperature. The experimental data close to room\ntemperature indeed can be described in this way, but at\nlower temperatures, where according to the optical\nexperiments the energy barrier should decrease, the\nexperimental \u03c3dc(T) shows a transition to a steeper slope in\nthe Arrhenius plot, thus suggesting an increase of the\neffective energy barrier. However, one has to be aware that\nfor the deduced relatively low energy barriers, much more\ncarriers are excited across the gap than in usual\nsemiconductors and the number of charge carriers may not\nbe the sole factor determining \u03c3dc(T). Instead, as speculated\nin chapter 3.2, temperature-dependent scattering processes at\nmagnetic or orbital fluctuations, successively increasing on\nthe approach towards TN, may explain the observed\nreduction of \u03c3dc. Below TN, the fluctuations become\nsuppressed, leading to the reduction of slope in the\nArrhenius plot and finally, below about 100 K, tunneling\nprocesses become the dominant charge transport process.\n\nFIG. 8. Highly schematic representation of the density of states\nof LaTiO3, based on the results from theoretical calculations using\nthe LDA (upper frame) and LDA+DMFT approaches (lower\nframe).54 The latter was calculated at T = 1000 K for a metallic\nsystem close to the MIT taking only the t2g states into account and\nusing a cubic structure with the same volume as the real\northorhombic crystal.54 Here, for insulating LaTiO3 we plotted the\nupper and lower Hubbard bands, leaving out the quasiparticle peak.\n\nIf we compare this calculated electronic structure with\nthe experimental results as shown in Fig. 6, we find that the\nexperimentally observed charge-transfer energy, \u2206 \u2248 8.5 eV\nis in good agreement with the calculations. However, it\nseems almost impossible to derive an experimental value of\nthe Coulomb energy U, as in \u03c3'(\u03bd) no well-resolved peak is\nobserved corresponding to an excitation from the lower to\nthe upper Hubbard band. Assuming that U is defined by the\nshoulder in \u03c3'(\u03bd) close to 3000 cm-1, we would end up with\na value of U of the order 0.5 eV, much too low when\ncompared to the ab initio calculations,54 yielding values of U\nbetween 4 \u2013 5 eV. The same problem arises when\ncomparing the experimentally observed gap Eg with the\ntheoretical values, which is of the order Eg = U - W \u2248 2 eV,\nwhile experimentally we observe a gap well below 0.1 eV,\neven in highly stoichiometric LaTiO3, which seems to be the\nmost insulating crystal investigated so far. Using the\nexisting models, Eg < 0.1 eV can only be explained when\nU \u2248 W. How can this discrepancy be explained? We note\nfirst that the calculations have been performed for a metallic\nsample. However, we believe that the main parameters, e.g.\n\u2206, U, and W, will not change considerably when moving to\nthe insulating side of the MIT. One explanation could be\nthat the symmetric densities of states of the lower and upper\nHubbard band have tails towards the Fermi energy. Due to\ntheir multiplett structure they possibly could be also rather\nasymmetric. A further problem may arise with the empty eg\nbands. Their exact position is unclear and they probably mix\nwith the upper Hubbard band. Thus electronic transitions\nfrom the lower Hubbard band to the eg band may well\ncontribute to the dynamic conductivity below the charge\ntransfer peak. From this it is clear that realistic LDA+DMFT\ncalculations of the dynamic conductivity in the insulating\nstate are highly warranted.\n\n3.6.3 Comparison with theoretical predictions\nIn recent years a number of calculations of the electronic\nband structure of LaTiO3, have appeared (e.g. refs. 52 53\n54). Here we focus on the most recent calculations using the\nab initio computational scheme LDA + DMFT (LDA: localdensity approximation, DMFT: dynamical mean-field\ntheory),54 which currently is the most advanced tool for the\ntheoretical investigation of materials with strong electronic\ncorrelations. These calculations, performed for doped\nLaTiO3, concentrated on doping levels just on the metallic\nside of the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). As pure\nLaTiO3 is close to the MIT we take the characteristic energy\nscales from these calculations. The results of LDA (upper\nframe) and LDA+DMFT (lower frame) are schematically\nshown in Fig. 8. Here the electronic densities of state are\nschematically indicated, neglecting all the fine structure and\nonly keeping the characteristic energies - the charge transfer\nenergy \u2206, the Coulomb repulsion U, and the band widths. In\naddition, the quasiparticle peak appearing at the Fermi level\nwithin the LDA+DMFT approach for doped, metallic\nLaTiO3 was omitted to account for the non-metallic state of\nundoped LaTiO3.\n\n9\n\n\fin favor of orbital order in LaTiO3 below TN and thus are at\nvariance with the formation of an orbital liquid state.\nFinally, from the optical conductivity we deduce a band\ngap of the order of 50 meV at low temperatures, revealing a\nsignificant temperature dependence. From a detailed\nanalysis we conclude that the transition is direct and\nforbidden. Close to the gap energy this frequency\ndependence is identical to the soft-edge behavior, identified\nin V2O3 (ref. 30) and indicative for strong electron\ncorrelations.\n\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn the preceding chapters, results from extreme\nbroadband dielectric and infrared measurements of LaTiO3,\nperformed for various temperatures and two crystallographic\ndirections, were presented. For the first time, a thorough\ninvestigation of the dielectric and charge transport properties\nin the region from dc to GHz frequencies was performed. In\nthe IR region, the phonon modes and their temperaturedependence was investigated with unprecedented precision\nand the gap-like feature beyond the last phonon mode was\nanalyzed in detail. From these measurements, overall a\nwealth of information on charge transport, dielectric\nproperties, and phase-transitions in LaTiO3 is gained:\nFrom the dc results and the IR measurements in the gap\nregion, a consistent picture of the charge transport processes\nin LaTiO3 evolves: At temperatures above about 100 K,\ncharge transport is governed by thermally excited charge\ncarriers that are excited over a rather small energy gap of the\norder of 50 meV between lower and upper Mott-Hubbard\nband. Due to the small gap value, the temperature\ndependence of \u03c3dc is dominated by temperature-dependent\nscattering processes at magnetic and/or orbital fluctuations\nthat become maximal at TN. Below about 100 K, Variable\nRange Hopping, i.e. phonon-assisted tunneling of Andersonlocalized charge carriers dominates the dc transport. Most\nprobably they arise from defect states due to impurities or\nlattice defects. In full accord with these findings, also the ac\nconductivity shows the clear signature of hopping\nconduction of Anderson-localized charge carriers.\nDepending on temperature, in the region from 10 MHz up to\nIR frequencies, a superlinear power law is observed, which\nseems to be a universal feature of all disordered matter40 and\nis important for the low-frequency extrapolation of the IR\ndata. The dc conductivity shows a considerable anisotropy\nup to nearly a decade, which changes sign close to the\ntransition from thermally activated band conduction to\ntunneling transport. It can be understood taking into account\nthe anisotropy induced by the orthorhombic lattice\ndistortion.\nThe intrinsic dielectric constant of LaTiO3 was\ndetermined as \u03b5\u221e \u2248 20 for E\u22a5a and \u03b5\u221e \u2248 44 for E||a. These\nvalues are relatively high, when compared with\nconventional semiconductors, but certainly do not indicate\nany ferroelectric correlations. From the FIR results it is\nconcluded that the \u03b5\u221e \u2248 20 for E\u22a5a is almost completely due\nto ionic polarization and any electronic contributions are\nnearly negligible. The found anisotropy of \u03b5\u221e most probably\nis related to the orthorhombic distortions, enhancing the\nionic polarizability along the a-direction.\nFrom the detailed investigation of the temperaturedependent phonon response, strong indications for a\nstructural phase transition, accompanying the magnetic\ntransition at TN are obtained. This notion is further supported\nby an anomaly at TN found in the temperature-dependent\nelectronic gap energy, which can be attributed to the\nincrease of the orthorhombic lattice distortion below TN. In\naddition, the phase transition also influences the dc\ntransport, via an increased scattering rate, as described\nabove. As promoted already in ref. 16, these findings speak\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to T. Kopp, Th. Pruschke, and D.\nVollhardt for stimulating discussions.
