We present a study of the star cluster associated with the\nmassive Galactic HII region NGC 3603 based on near-IR broad\u2013 and\nnarrowband observations taken with ISAAC/VLT under excellent seeing\nconditions (\u2264 0.4\u2032\u2032 ). We discuss color-color diagrams and address the\nimpact of the high UV flux on the disk evolution of the low-mass stars.\n\n1.\n\nStellar Content and Ionized Gas around NGC 3603\n\nNGC 3603 is the most massive Galactic H II region and star cluster that can\nbe studied at optical wavelengths. The OB stars contribute more than 2000M\u2299\nto the cluster mass, and provide about 100 times more ionizing power than\nthose of the Trapezium cluster (Moffat, Drissen & Shara 1994, Kennicutt 1984).\nAt a distance of only 6 kpc it is the perfect laboratory to study starburst-like\nconditions on a star-by-star basis, and hence the conditions that may lead to\nthe formation and disruption of massive stellar clusters.\nEisenhauer et al. (1998) have studied the stellar IMF in NGC 3603 down\nto \u223c 1 M\u2299 using JHK adaptive optics observations. We have further studied\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBrandl et al.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nLeft: Deep H-band ISAAC/VLT image of the central 50\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 50\u2032\u2032\n(1.55 \u00d7 1.55pc2 ) of NGC 3603. Right: 150s exposure in the Bracket-\u03b3 line of\nthe 2.\u2032 6 \u00d7 2.\u2032 6 around NGC 3603; the continuum emission has been subtracted.\n\nthe stellar content of NGC 3603 in Brandl et al. (1999) and found that the core\nregion is well populated in low-mass stars down to at least 0.1 M\u2299 with ages\ncomparable to that of the high mass stars. Figure 1a shows the result of a 45\nminute deep H-band image taken with ISAAC at the VLT in April 1999 under\nexcellent seeing conditions (\u2264 0.\u2032\u2032 4). The faintest stars visible in this image are\nabout H = 21m , corresponding to 0.1 M\u2299 for an age of 1 Myr.\nWe have obtained ISAAC/VLT images in a variety of narrowband filters\n(Br-\u03b3, H2 , [FeII], HeI, CO-bandhead). Figure 1b shows a short exposure in the\nBracket-\u03b3 line with a total integration time of only 150 seconds; the K-band\ncontinuum emission has been subtracted. Despite the low signal-to-noise the\nextended nebular structures and the ionization fronts to the west and southeast\nof NGC 3603 are clearly visible. The image reveals the ring nebula around the\nblue supergiant Sher 25 (Brandner et al. 1997) about 18\u2032\u2032 north of the core and\nits bipolar outflows to the east and west. The proplyd-like structures, recently\ndiscovered by Brandner et al. (2000), are clearly visible. The deeply embedded\nproto cluster IRS 9 about 1\u2032 south of NGC 3603 becomes almost invisible after\ncontinuum subtraction.\nFigure 2 shows the color-color-diagram for all stars within the central parsec\n(r \u2264 33\u2032\u2032 ) detected in all three JHK bands on the same pixel. To reduce the\ncontamination from field stars we have statistically subtracted the stellar density\nin the outer parts of our 3.\u2032 4 large FOV. The solid line in Fig. 2 indicates the\nevolution along the (pre-) main sequence for a foreground extinction of AV =\n4.5m . The separation in two \"clumps\" indicates that only stars more massive\nthan about A5V (\u223c 2 M\u2299 ) have reached the main sequence.\nNote that classical T-Tauri or Herbig AeBe stars would fall in a region to\nthe right of the lower dashed line (extinction vector). IR-excess emission from\ndisks and circumstellar matter would make their colors significantly different.\nDespite the young age, there is no evidence for a significant percentage of young\nstars with circumstellar matter within the central parsec, probably because of\n\n\fNGC 3603\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.\n\n(J-H)/(H-K) color-color diagram for all stars within r \u2264 33\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhere the field stars have been statistically subtracted. The long dashed lines\nrepresent the reddening vectors. The thick line shows the location of (pre-)\nmain sequence stars for AV = 4.5m .\n\nphotoevaporation due to the high UV flux generated by the massive stars. If\nthis result is generally true, no planetary systems should be expected in globular\nclusters.\nAcknowledgments.
