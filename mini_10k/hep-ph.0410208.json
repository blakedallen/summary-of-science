Villaa\na\n\nSwiss Federal Institute of Technology, EPFL, LPHE-IPEP, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nA review is given of the measurements of triple and quartic couplings among the electroweak gauge bosons\nperformed at LEP by the four experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL. Emphasis is placed on recently\npublished results and on combinations of results performed by the LEP electroweak gauge-couplings group.

INTRODUCTION\nSelf couplings among electroweak gauge bosons\nare a consequence of the non-Abelian structure\nof the Standard Model (SM) of electroweak interactions [1]. The measurement of triple (TGC)\nand quartic couplings (QGC) has been one of the\nmain activities of the LEP experiments (ALEPH,\n+ \u2212\nDELPHI, L3 and\n\u221a OPAL) after the e e centreof-mass energy ( s) was raised above the threshold for the production of two W bosons (LEP2\nphase). Experiments have performed both precision measurements of couplings as predicted by\nthe theory and searches for anomalous couplings\nwhich could be present as a consequence of new\nphysics. The theoretical input is normally expressed in the form of an effective Lagrangian\ncontaining all operators of a given order which\ncontribute to the set of vertices under study and\nwhich are consistent with basic physical assumptions such as Lorentz and electromagnetic gauge\ninvariance. The extraction of couplings is then\nperformed either by fitting distributions of a chosen set of sensitive variables or by means of optimal observables techniques [2], in which the sensitivity to the couplings is concentrated in a reduced number of properly defined variables.\nAll results reported in this paper are based\non data collected\nat LEP during 1996\u20132000 at\n\u221a\n161 GeV < s < 209 GeV, corresponding to total\nintegrated luminosities up to about 700 pb\u22121 per\nexperiment. For many channels and couplings,\nLEP combined results exist. The latest combinations are summarized in [3] where reference is\n\n2. CHARGED TRIPLE GAUGE COUPLINGS\nThe WWZ and WW\u03b3 vertices can be probed\nat LEP2 in WW, single W and single \u03b3 production. To lowest order, three Feynman graphs contribute to WW production: the s-channel Z and \u03b3\nproduction and the t-channel neutrino exchange.\nThe two s-channel diagrams contain the WWZ\nand WW\u03b3 vertices. WW\u03b3 is also involved in the\nsingle W process (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 We\u03bd) via W-\u03b3 fusion\nand in single \u03b3 production (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304e \u03b3), via\nW-boson fusion. The most general parametrization of the WWZ and WW\u03b3 vertices can be written as a function of seven complex TGCs for\neach vertex [4]. Some assumptions are normally\nmade in order to reduce the number of parameters to be measured. Imposing the conservation of C and P symmetry and electromagnetic\ngauge invariance reduces the number of free pa1\n\n\f2\n\n1250\n\na)\n\n1000\n\nEvents/0.2\n\nrameters to five, usually chosen to be g1Z , \u03ba\u03b3 ,\n\u03bb\u03b3 , \u03baZ and \u03bbZ . At tree level within the SM,\ng1Z = \u03ba\u03b3 = \u03baZ = 1 and \u03bb\u03b3 = \u03bbZ = 1. A further reduction is normally achieved by the requirement\nof custodial SU(2) gauge invariance, which translates to the constraints \u03baZ = g1Z \u2212 tan2 \u03b8W (\u03ba\u03b3 \u2212 1)\nand \u03bbZ = \u03bb\u03b3 [5,6], where \u03b8W is the weak mixing\nangle. g1Z , \u03ba\u03b3 and \u03bb\u03b3 are normally chosen as the\nminimal set of parameters to be measured and\nare the ones used in the LEP-wide combinations.\nThe WW channel gives the best sensitivity\nat LEP in the measurement of charged TGCs.\nAnomalous couplings would affect the total production cross section, the production angle and\nthe polarization of the W bosons. A WW event,\nyielding two fermions and two anti-fermions in\nthe final state, is completely described in terms\nof five angles: the W production angle and the\npolar and azimuthal angles of the fermion in the\nW\u2212 rest frame and of the anti-fermion in the W+\nrest frame. The distributions of these angles, or\nother quantities derived from them, are used by\nthe LEP experiments to derive measurements of\nTGCs. As an example, the distribution of the cosine of the W\u2212 production angle in fully hadronic\nWW events collected by L3 [7] is shown in Figure 1, where the effect of anomalous values of g1Z\nis also plotted.\nThe single W channel gives a sensitivity comparable to that obtained with WW events only\non \u03ba\u03b3 ; on the other hand it gives the possibility to disentangle the effects of the WWZ and\nWW\u03b3 vertices, which are correlated in measurements based on the WW channel. In this process,\nthe electron is produced at very low polar angle\nand is therefore not detected, leaving a signature\nof only one W boson in the detector. LEP experiments use different kinematic variables to extract\nthe couplings from the single W channel. As an\nexample the transverse momentum of the electrons and muons in leptonically decaying W's as\nmeasured by ALEPH are shown in Figure 2. The\nenergy spectrum and the angular distribution of\nthe photon produced in single \u03b3 processes are sensitive to the WW\u03b3 vertex, even though less than\nthe WW and single W channels.\nMeasurements of charged TGCs by the four\nLEP experiments are summarized in Table 1, to-\n\nS.

All\nmeasurements are consistent with the SM expectations.\n3. NEUTRAL TRIPLE GAUGE COUPLINGS\nTriple couplings among neutral electroweak\ngauge bosons are not present in the SM at tree\nlevel, and get contributions of the order of 10\u22124\nfrom loop diagrams. Such couplings could be enhanced by new physics effects [8] and it is therefore important to set limits on their strength. The\n\u03b3\u03b3Z, \u03b3ZZ and ZZZ vertices can give as on-shell\nfinal state bosons either Z\u03b3 or ZZ. Two independent parametrizations describe the two cases: the\neight hV\ni couplings (i = 1, . . . , 4) for the Z\u03b3 final\nstate and the four fiV couplings (i = 4, 5) for the\n\n\f3\n\nGauge boson couplings at LEP\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n\n14\n\n0.15\n\n12\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\n0.05\n\n8\n\n0\n\n6\n\n-0.05\n\n4\n\n4\n\n-0.1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-0.15\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nPte [GeV]\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nPt\u03bc [GeV]\n\n-0.2\n\n\u03ba\u03b3\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bb\u03b3\n\nEvents\n\nEvents\n\nTable 1\nResults of the measurements of charged TGCs by the LEP experiments and their combinations.

QUARTIC GAUGE COUPLINGS\nQuartic couplings are present in the SM Lagrangian, but their size is expected to be too small\nto be measurable at LEP. The LEP experiments\nhave therefore performed measurements to set\nlimits on the existence of anomalous QGCs, both\nof the type predicted by the electroweak theory\nand of more general form, which might be induced\nby new physics. The parametrization used [10]\nonly considers quartic terms in the Lagrangian\nwhich are not associated with TGCs, since the\nother terms are more strongly constrained by\nthe measurements discussed in Section 2 and 3.\nGiven the kinematic limit of LEP (maximum of\ntwo on-shell heavy bosons produced), the following vertices can be tested: WW\u03b3\u03b3, parametrized\nW\nby aW\n0 and ac , WWZ\u03b3, parametrized by an , and\nZZ\u03b3\u03b3 parametrized by aZ0 and aZc . Only the first\ntwo vertices are present in the SM. Due to the dimension of Lagrangian operators containing four\ngauge bosons, quartic couplings have dimensions\nof the inverse of a squared energy and are there-\n\nfore normally written as proportional to 1/\u039b2 ,\nwhere \u039b is the typical energy scale of the new\nphysics responsible for the QGCs.\nAt LEP, three topologies can give information\nabout QGCs. The first one is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 WW\u03b3,\nW\nwhich is sensitive to the couplings aW\n0 , ac and an .\nEvents with this topology are produced via radiative W-pair production, where a photon is radiated from one of the initial or final state fermions\nor from one of the W bosons. Anomalous couplings would increase the cross section and modify the photon energy spectrum, as can be seen\nin Figure 5, where DELPHI data [11] is shown\ntogether with Monte Carlo expectations for SM\nand for some non-zero values of the coupling aW\nc .\nThe second channel sensitive to QGCs is\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3. This final state can be produced\nboth through W fusion into a WW\u03b3\u03b3 vertex and\nvia s-channel Z production, a ZZ\u03b3\u03b3 vertex and\nsubsequent decay of the Z into a neutrino pair.\nThe same signature of two acoplanar photons is\nused in separate fits to determine the W and Z\ncouplings, each time varying only one parame-\n\n\f5\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n+0.06\n+0.02\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n15\n\n1999 data\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n\n2000 data\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n\n1998 data\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\ne+e-\u2192\u03bd\u03bd\u03b3\u03b3\n180 - 209 GeV\n\n10\n\nb)\n\nSM\n\n8\n\nOPAL data\n\n6\n\naZ0/\u039b2 = 0.025\n2\naW\n0/\u039b = 0.050\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n15\n\na)\n\n10\n\n-0.06\n-0.02\n0\n\n15\n\nEvents\n\n8\n\nEvents\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\n1998 data\n\n6\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\n8\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\nnb. events/2.5 GeV\n\nGauge boson couplings at LEP\n\n4\n5\n2\n0\n\n1999 data\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200\n\nMrec [GeV/c ]\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nE\u03b32 [GeV]\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n\n2000 data\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nE\u03b3 (GeV)\n\nFigure 5.

For the WW\u03b3\u03b3\nand WWZ\u03b3 couplings, no recent LEP combined\nresults exist. The results of the single LEP experiments are reported in Table 3.\n5. CONCLUSION\nResults of the measurements of triple and quartic gauge boson couplings by the four LEP experiments are reviewed in this paper, together with\ntheir combinations. Most results are either published or being finalized for publication. The measurement of charged TGCs, which are predicted\nas a fundamental consequence of the gauge structure of the electroweak theory, has reached at\nLEP the precision of about 2\u20134%, with results in\nagreement with the SM. Searches for anomalous\ntriple and quartic couplings have been performed\nby all LEP experiments in several different final\nstates, and limits are set with no deviations observed from the SM predictions.\n\n\f6\n\nS.
