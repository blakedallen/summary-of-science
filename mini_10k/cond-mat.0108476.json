Our\nstudies reveal that the linewidths of the Ag (2) and Ag (4) phonons increase as temperature\ndecreases. This anomalous temperature dependence of phonon lineshapes, seen for the first\ntime in charge ordered manganites, can be quantitatively understood in terms of a strong\nspin-phonon coupling involving t2g spins and Ag phonons.\n\nThe recent upsurge of interest in doped manganites exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance\nhas fuelled a lot of interesting questions regarding the role of spin, orbital and lattice degrees of\nfreedom and the interplay amongst them [1]. These systems of the form A1\u2212x A\u2032x MnO3 , where\nA is a trivalent rare earth ion (e.g., La, Pr, Nd) and A\u2032 is a divalent ion (e.g., Ca, Sr, Pb) show\na rich phase diagram depending on the tolerance factor and the amount of doping x which in\nturn controls the ratio of Mn3+ to Mn4+ . The essential ingredients for understanding their\nelectronic properties are the double-exchange(DE) mechanism [2] and the polaron formation\ndue to the Jahn-Teller(JT) effect [3]. In the case of systems where the weighted average\nA-site cation radius is small, the system also shows charge ordering (CO), i.e., real space\nordering of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions at low temperatures [4]. The CO state becomes stable when\nthe repulsive Coulomb interaction between the carriers or the cooperative JT effect dominates\nover the kinetic energy of carriers. In such situations there is a strong competition between the\nDE interaction which favours ferromagetism (FM), and CO which favours antiferromagnetism\n(AF) via the coupling between the background t2g (S = 3/2) spins.\n(\u2217 ) Present Address : 104 Davey Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802,\nUSA\n(\u2217\u2217 ) Present Address : The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11,\n34100 Trieste, Italy\n(\u2217\u2217\u2217 ) Email : [rajeev, venkat, asood, tvrama] @physics.iisc.ernet.in ; cnrrao@jncasr.ac.in\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nThe system under study, Pr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , shows a rich phase diagram as a function of\ndoping and temperature and has been studied using a variety of probes like resistivity [5],\nmagnetization and neutron diffraction [6]. In the temperature range T > TCO (\u223c 240 K) the\nsystem is a paramagnetic insulator. In dc magnetic susceptibility, a large peak is observed at\nTCO followed by a relatively small peak at TN . The peak at TCO is attributed to ferromagnetic\ncorrelations [7]. The system further undergoes a transition at TN \u223c 175K to the chargeexchange (CE) type antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI). The CE type structure for x < 0.5\nis different from what is present in systems with x = 0.5. In this so called \"pseudo-CE\"\nstructure the zig-zag FM chains in the ab plane are FM aligned along the c-axis [7]. This\nis unlike the CE structure where the layers in the ab plane are aligned antiferromagnetically\nalong c. Further lowering of temperature below 50 K leads to another transition which can\nbe understood either as a canted antiferromagnetic state [6] or as a mixture of ferromagnetic\ndomains (or clusters) in an antiferromagnetic background.\nIn this letter we report our Raman studies on well characterized, high-quality single crystals\nof Pr0.63 Ca0.37 MnO3 [8] as a function of temperature from 300K to 25K. There are many Raman studies on manganites in recent times covering both the vibrational [9\u201313] and electronic\nRaman scattering [14] across the metal-insulator transition. In a recent work on polycrystalline Pr0.65 Ca0.35 MnO3 [15], temperature dependence of the modes at 475 and 610cm\u22121\nwas studied and the splitting of these modes below TCO was attributed to the folding of the\nBrillouin zone in the CO state. In another Raman study [16], the effect of A-site substitution\non the Ag (2) mode was discussed. However, the linewidths have not been discussed, and as\nwe show in this letter, they reveal a very unusual behaviour. The aim of the present study of\nPr0.63 Ca0.37 MnO3 is to explore the coupling between phonons, electrons and spins by examining the temperature dependence of Raman linewidths across the CO and magnetic transitions.\nOur studies do reveal a strong anomalous temperature dependence of the linewidths of the two\nRaman active Ag modes, which we have quantitatively analysed in terms of strong spin-lattice\ncoupling in these systems.\nThe single crystal used for the experiment was prepared by the float zone technique [5].\nA (100) crystalline face of dimensions 5mm diameter and 2mm thickness was polished using\ndiamond paste and mounted on the cold finger of the closed-cycle helium refrigerator (RMC\nmodel 22C CRYODYNE) using thermally cycled GE (M/s. General Electric, USA) varnish.\nRaman spectra were recorded in the spectral range 150 cm\u22121 to 750 cm\u22121 in back-scattering\ngeometry using a DILOR XY spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled chargecoupled device detector. An argon ion laser line at 514.5nm was used as the excitation\nwavelength at laser power of \u223c 25mW focussed to a spot of 40\u03bcm on the sample. The\ntemperatures quoted are those measured on the cold finger using a Pt-sensor coupled to a\nhome-made temperature controller. The temperatures are within an accuracy of \u00b1 1K and\ndo not take into account laser heating.\nFor an ideal perovskite ABO3 with cubic structure (space group O1h , P m3m) the irreducible representations at the zone center are given by 4F1u + F2u . The only allowed optical\nmodes are the infrared modes and since all lattice sites have inversion symmetry, first-order\nRaman scattering is forbidden.The small size of the Pr cation in comparison to the oxygen\ncauses a large tilting of the MnO6 octahedra leading to a GdFeO3 structure. The space group\nof Pr0.63 Ca0.37 MnO3 at room temperature is P bnm (D16\n2h ); there are four formula units per\nunit cell and there are 24 Raman active modes [9]. Iliev et al. [9] have carried out systematic\nRaman measurements at room temperature and lattice dynamical calculations on undoped,\nstoichiometric, orthorhombic YMnO3 and LaMnO3 with P bnm structure and identified the\nsymmetry of the different modes. The Raman modes are weak even in stoichiometric LaMnO3 ;\nthe observed modes at 140, 198, 257, 284 and 493cm\u22121 were assigned Ag symmetry, modes\n\n\fR.

Recent experiments on LaMnO3 have revealed the presence of high-energy modes (\u223c 1000cm\u22121)\nwhich have been attributed to the orbital excitations [17]. However, doped manganites being pseudo-cubic, Raman lines are extremely weak and broad [9\u201313]. The number of modes\nobserved in doped manganites are very few; e.g., in La0.7 Ca0.3 MnO3 there are five modes\nobserved at low temperature at 70, 133, 235, 435, and 670cm\u22121 [11].\nIn the micro-Raman setup using 6328 \u00c5radiation from He-Ne laser, we observe four bands\ncentered around \u223c 260, 290, 450 and 650cm\u22121 . However, in macro-geometry with the crystal\nin the cryostat, only two modes centered around 258 and 288cm\u22121 at 300K were observed\nwith sufficient signal to noise ratio (Fig. 1). The other bands near 450 and 650cm\u22121 are\nweaker and therefore could not be followed as a function of temperature.\nWe will now discuss the origin of the observed modes. Since the crystal structure for\nPr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 is same as that of LaMnO3 , it is plausible to assign to these modes the\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nsymmetry used by Iliev et al. [9] for LaMnO3 . The low-frequency mode at 258cm\u22121 has been\nattributed to the Ag (2) mode which is the in-phase rotation of the oxygen cage about the y-axis\non adjacent MnO6 octahedra. In this mode only the in-plane oxygen atoms, namely O1, are\ninvolved. The mode at 288cm\u22121 has been assigned to the Ag (4) mode which is out-of-phase\nrotation of the oxygen cage about the x-axis. Here along with the in-plane oxygens (O1), the\napical oxygens (O2) are also involved. The Mn ion being at the centre of inversion symmetry\nremains stationary in both the modes. Figs. 2a and 2b show the variation of the peak position\nand linewidths (full width at half-maximum) for the two modes as a function of temperature,\nobtained by nonlinear least-square fitting of the data with a sum of two Lorentzians along\nwith a baseline. The mode frequencies increase as the temperature is lowered and a sharp\nchange is noticeable at \u223c 50 K as the system undergoes a transition to a canted AFI phase [5].\nMost interestingly, the linewidths for both the modes show anomalous behaviour in that the\nwidths decrease as the temperature is increased. Another notable observation is the large\nvalue of linewidth even at low temperatures.\nNext we look at the various possibilities that may lead to the observed temperature dependence of mode frequencies. Mode softening (\u223c 3%) as the temperature is raised can arise\ndue to the quasi-harmonic contribution arising from the lattice expansion which can, in turn,\nchange the force constants. This change in frequency is related to the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter\nand the volume change. Since the fractional volume change across the studied temperature\nregime is not available for Pr0.63 Ca0.37 MnO3 we can be guided by the data available in literature for Pr0.7 Ca0.3 MnO3 . The volume change is \u223c 0.4% between temperatures of 300 and\n10 K. This change is too small to account for the observed frequency changes of both the\nAg modes. Another contribution can arise due to the intrinsic anharmonic (cubic) interactions. This contribution is also insufficient to explain the large softening, since typically for\nperovskites, e.g., KTaO3 , the change of peak position is about 2-3 cm\u22121 in the temperature\nrange 10-500 K [18].\nNow we consider the linewidths. Anharmonic interactions will lead to an increase of\nthe linewidth with increasing temperature, in contrast to our experimental results. Lee and\nMin [19] have proposed a model to explain the sound velocity softening across the charge\nordering transition in La0.5 Ca0.5 MnO3 [20]. Recently Dattagupta and Sood [21] have extended\nthis model incorporating both the DE interaction and electron-optical phonon coupling. Their\nmodels also fail to explain the behaviour of linewidth at low temperatures in the magnetically\nordered phase. We suggest that magnon-phonon interaction leads to the shifts in phonon\nfrequencies as well as the observed temperature dependence of lifetimes. The frequency shift\ncan be understood as arising due to the modulation of the exchange integral between Mn ions.\nThis has been considered earlier for LaMnO3+\u03b4 [13] to explain the softening of the Mn-O-Mn\nstretching mode. However, this model also does not take into account the dynamics and\nhence cannot explain the temperature dependence of the linewidth(\u0393). A sharp increase in\nthe peak positions at low temperatures near the canted AF transition (see Fig. (2)) suggests\na strong coupling between the Raman modes and spin excitations, which we show to be also\nresponsible for the anomalous temperature dependence of the linewidths.\nWe briefly outline here the origin of the large spin-phonon coupling and the way it leads to\nanomalous phonon damping. Details will be published elsewhere [22]. When the neighbouring\nMnO6 octahedra are tilted, the Mn-O-Mn bond angle \u03b8ij (= [\u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )]) between nearestneighbour Mn-O bonds involving Mn ions i and j changes. Here \u03b8i and \u03b8j are the small\nangles of rotation of the neighbouring octahedra centred at i and j, respectively. Since the\n0\ncos \u03b8ij /2 \u223c\noxygen mediated overlap tij between Mn-d orbitals goes as cos \u03b8ij , Jij goes as Jij\n0\nJij\n(1 \u2212\n\n(\u03b8i \u2212\u03b8j )2\n).\n2\n\nThis has a term of the form \u03b8i \u03b8j which, among others, corresponds to a\n\n\fR. Gupta et al.: Anomalous Raman Linewidths in CO Manganites\n\n5\n\nsimultaneous excitation of the rotation mode involving the Mn-O bond, with a displacement\nq1i (\u223c a\u03b8i ) and another mode q2j (\u223c a\u03b8j ) where a is the Mn-O bond length. The coupling\nbetween the two phonons will be strongest if they belong to the same symmetry representation.\nThe first of these is the Raman-active phonon under consideration, with a frequency \u03c91 =\n258cm\u22121 (Ag (2)) or \u03c91 = 288cm\u22121 (Ag (4)) and the other is an optical phonon mode with\nfrequency \u03c92 .\nFor simplicity in calculation, we assume that the magnetic order is of the C-type in which\nferromagnetic chains are linear in contrast to the zig-zag chains in the CE structure. Both\nthese structures are geometrically similar, have the same number of nearest-neighbour FM\nand AF bonds per spin, and have the same magnetic energies per spin [23]. Though there\ncan be quantitative differences in their magnetic excitation spectrum, qualitatively both are\nvery similar in that they have mixed FM and AF character along arbitrary directions of the\nBrillouin zone with the same number of nearest-neighbour FM/AF couplings and the same\noverall geometry, namely FM along a line and AF in plane. The latter decides the dispersion\nrelation and the phase space for the mixed FM and AF spin excitations. Since we are interested\nin understanding how magnetic fluctuations affect the phonon spectrum, it is therefore a very\ngood approximation to work with the C-type structure rather than the CE or pseudo-CE type\nstructures. The effective spin-Hamiltonian for this anisotropic spin system is given by\nX\nX\nxz\n(1)\nJFy Si * Sj ,\nJAF\nSi * Sj \u2212\nHspin =\nhiji;i,j\u2208xz\n\nhiji;j\u2208y\n\nwhere AF and F refer to antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. Our Hamiltonian\nis most naturally viewed as an effective Hamiltonian with t2g spin degrees of freedom kept\nexplicitly, and all other degrees of freedom (such as eg electrons, JT coupling between eg electrons and lattice modes orthogonal to those considered here, Hund's rule coupling) integrated\nout. (This is possible and sensible because the t2g spins are the lowest energy degrees of\nfreedom near and below TN , as discussed below.) It has been shown by several authors, e.g.,\nKugel and Khomskii [24], that in LaMnO3 (which is an insulator experimentally showing JT\ndistortions and ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically) the Mn-O-Mn-mediated\nmagnetic interaction is ferromagnetic in plane and antiferromagnetic (usual superexchange)\nperpendicular to it. The latter is indeed due to the same sort of virtual processes involving the\nMn-O-Mn bond as the AF superexchange. It has been shown that [24] the JT distortions (and\nconsequent eg orbital excited states), and the Hund's rule coupling JH (which enslaves the eg\nspins to the t2g spin in the ground state and produces an excited state an energy JH away,\nwith eg , t2g spins antiparallel) lead to a ferromagnetic Mn-O-Mn-mediated in-plane exchange\ncoupling. Thus detailed models involving DE and JT coupling show as briefly mentioned\nabove, that both AF and F coupling between t2g spins necessarily involve Mn-O-Mn overlap.\nFurther, if there are no other low-energy degrees of freedom (e.g., no eg fermionic low-energy\nmetallic excitations, or orbital fluctuations), then the form of Eq. (1) of the text with the\ndiscussed dependence on Mn-O-Mn angle, is inevitable. A microscopic theory will relate the\nJij to basic parameters of the electron Hamiltonian, but Jij is always second order in the\nMn-O-Mn overlap. The only other possible low-energy degrees of freedom in the insulating\nphases of CMR oxides are orbital fluctuations. Here we contend that these are not relevant\nin the temperature range we are working in because orbital order is already well developed.\nFor small fluctuations of the Mn-O bond angle, from the above discussion, the spin-phonon\ninteraction Hamiltonian (Hs\u2212p ) becomes\nX\nX\ng\ng\ny\nxz\nJoAF\nSi * Sj q1i q2j + 2\nJoF\nSi * Sj q1i q2j\nHs\u2212p = \u2212 2\n2a\n2a\nhiji;i,j\u2208xz\n\nhiji;j\u2208y\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n+\n\nX\n\nxz\nJoAF\nSi * Sj \u2212\n\nX\n\ny\nJoF\nSi * Sj ,\n\n(2)\n\nhiji;j\u2208y\n\nhiji;i,j\u2208xz\n\nwhere g is a coupling constant of order unity. The spin degrees of freedom are described in\nterms of Schwinger bosons (SB) [25] which is an exact representation. It is convenient both\nbelow and above the N\u00e9el temperature (TN ). Below TN , the SB Bose condense. The spin-spin\ninteraction in Eq.

We choose JoAF\n\u223c 3.9meV and JoF\n\u223c 7.8 meV so as to give TN = 175 K.\nThe spin-phonon interaction in Eq. (2), written in terms of the SB operators, leads to\na coupling between the Ag mode being observed, and the second optical phonon mode of\nwavenumber \u03c92 , with the excitation of nearest-neighbour spin fluctuations or boson pairs.\nWe calculate the decay rate for the Ag phonons of frequency h\u0304\u03c91 in perturbation theory, to\nsecond order in Hs\u2212p . The phonon decays due to the second-order process which involves the\nAg phonon decaying into the second phonon and two Schwinger bosons. The imaginary (real)\npart of the self-energy \u03a3 determines the decay rate (peak shift) of the Raman-active phonon.\nAssuming the phonon modes to be dispersionless, the imaginary part of \u03a3 is given by\nIm \u03a3 =\n\ng2 X\nf (q, k)\u03b4(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9q )[1 + g\u03c9(q+k) + g\u03c92 ][1 + g\u03c9(k) + g\u03c9(q) ], (5)\n8\u03c0a2\nq,k\n\nwhere f (q, k), the form factor is given by\n2\n\ny\ny\nxz\nf (q, k) = (JoF\nBy ) p1 A21 + (JoF\nBy )(JoAF\nBxz )A1 (p2 A2 + p3 A3 )/2\n2\n\nxz\n+ (JoAF\nBxz ) (p4 A23 + p5 A22 + p6 A2 A3 )/4,\n\n(6)\n\n\u22121\npi are products of Bogoliubov or coherence factors, g\u03c9(k)\n= e\u03b2\u03c9k \u2212 1, A1 = 2(cos qy + cos ky ),\nA2 = 2(cos qx + cos qz ), and A3 = 2(cos kx + cos kz ).\nWe find substantial linewidth at T = 0, which initially increases with temperature because\nof thermal availability of two SB states at energy h\u0304(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ). At high temperatures, of order\nTN or higher, the spin fluctuation mode softens, and the density of pair excitations at a\nfixed energy difference h\u0304(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) decreases as temperature increases. The Weiss fields also\ndecrease with increasing temperature. Thus the Ag (2) phonon decay rate falls. This decrease\nhas been estimated in the SB formalism both below and above TN (the Bose condensation\ntemperature in that formalism), or in a classical theory for spin dynamics of a Heisenberg spin\nsystem specially useful above TN ; the results above TN are roughly the same. In the latter\ntheory, one essentially obtains the nearest-neighbour spin-fluctuation frequency spectrum via\n\n\fR. Gupta et al.: Anomalous Raman Linewidths in CO Manganites\n\n7\n\nclassical equations of motion of coupled spin vectors. We show the Schwinger boson results\nin Fig. 2 for both linewidths and peak positions. Guided by the lattice dynamic studies of\nIliev et al. [9] on LaMnO3 , we have taken the Ag phonon at 190cm\u22121 as \u03c92 . The qualitative\nbehaviour of \u0393 and peak postions will not change with another choice of \u03c92 . As can be seen,\nthe agreement between the experiment and theory is rather good above 70K. Our approach\ndoes not take into account the observed canted AFI state below T < 50K, which may be\nresponsible for the discrepancy between the theory and experiments at low temperatures.\nThe canting of spins leads to FM correlations in an otherwise perfectly ordered AF state\nwhich, in turn, modifies the spin excitation spectrum.\nIn conclusion, our Raman measurements on Pr1\u2212xCax MnO3 (x = 0.37) reveal a strong\ncoupling between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom in CO manganites. The large variation of the mode frequency and anomalous behaviour of the linewidths as a function of\ntemperature are understood in terms of spin-phonon interaction. Thus, we believe, our study\nreveals the striking consequences of the strong interplay between the spin and lattice degrees\nof freedom in CO manganites.\nRG and GVP thank the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (India) and AKS\nthanks the Department of Science and Technology (India) for financial support.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.
