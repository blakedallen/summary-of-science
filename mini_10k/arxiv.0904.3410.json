The \u039b(1405) has been a historical example of a dynamically generated resonance in meson-baryon coupledchannels dynamics with S = \u22121 [1]. Modern investigations\nbased on chiral dynamics with a unitary framework also\nreproduce well the observed spectrum of the \u039b(1405) together with cross sections of K \u2212 p to various channels [2,\n3,4,5,6,7]. Recently it was pointed out in Ref. [8] that the\n\u039b(1405) can be regarded almost purely as a dynamically\ngenerated state in meson-baryon scattering, while the description of the N (1535) demands some components other\nthan meson-baryon ones, such as genuine quark components.\nOne of the important consequences of chiral dynamics\nis that the \u039b(1405) is described by superposition of two\nresonance states [9]. One state located around 1420 MeV\ncouples dominantly to the K\u0304N channel, while the other\none sitting around 1390 MeV with a 130 MeV width couples strongly to the \u03c0\u03a3 channel. Consequently, the spectra\nof the \u039b(1405) depend on the channels and the resonance\nposition in the K\u0304N channel is 1420 MeV, higher than the\nnominal one which is 1405 MeV. Therefore, it is important to observe the resonance position of the \u039b(1405) in\nthe K\u0304N channel.\n\nTo observe the resonance position of the \u039b(1405) in\nthe K\u0304N channel it is necessary to produce the \u039b(1405)\nby reactions initiated by K\u0304N . Since the \u039b(1405) resonance appears below the threshold of the K\u0304N channel,\ndirect production of \u039b(1405) in the K\u0304N channel is kinematically forbidden. This fact leads us to indirect productions of \u039b(1405), such as \u03b3p \u2192 \u039b(1405)K \u2217 [10], K \u2212 p \u2192\n\u03b3\u039b(1405) [11], K \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c00 \u039b(1405) [12,13], and nuclear reactions [14]. Here we discuss the K \u2212 induced production\nof \u039b(1405) with a deuteron target, K \u2212 d \u2192 \u039b(1405)n. In\nthis reaction, the final neutron takes energy out from the\ninitial kaon and the \u039b(1405) is produced by the K\u0304N channel.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we explain our model to calculate the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reactions\nand introduce the description of \u039b(1405) based on the\nchiral unitary approach. In Sec. 3 we show our numerical\nresults of the calculations and compare our results with\nexperiments. Section 4 is devoted to a summary of this\nwork.\n\n2 Formulation\nIn this section, we explain our approach to calculate the\ncross section of the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reaction.

The description of the twobody meson-baryon scattering amplitudes and the model\nof \u039b(1405) in the chiral unitary approach are discussed in\nSec. 2.3.\n2.1 Kinematics\nWe consider \u039b(1405) production induced by K \u2212 with a\ndeuteron target, K \u2212 d \u2192 \u039b(1405)n. The \u039b(1405) produced in this reaction decays into \u03c0\u03a3 with I = 0 as\nshown in Fig. 1. The \u039b(1405) is identified by the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass spectra of this reaction. Figure 1 also gives\nthe kinematical variables of the initial and final particles.\nThe kinematics of the three-body final state is completely\nfixed by five variables, the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass M\u03c0\u03a3 , the\nneutron solid angle \u03a9n in the c.m. frame and the pion\nsolid angle \u03a9\u03c0\u2217 in the rest frame of \u03c0 and \u03a3 [15]. Thus the\ndifferential cross section of this reaction can be written by\nd\u03c3 =\n\n1 Md M\u03a3 Mn\n|T |2 |p\u03c0\u2217 | |pn | dM\u03c0\u03a3 d\u03a9\u03c0\u2217 d\u03a9n (1)\n2\n(2\u03c0)5 4kc.m.Ec.m.\n\nwhere T is the T -matrix of this reaction, Ec.m. is the center\nof mass energy, kc.m. is the kaon c.m. momentum and p\u03c0\u2217\nis the pion momentum in the rest frame of \u03c0 and \u03a3. The\npion momentum |p\u03c0\u2217 | in the \u03c0\u03a3 rest frame can be fixed\nby the invariant mass M\u03c0\u03a3 as\n|p\u03c0\u2217 | =\n\n2\n2\n\u03bb1/2 (M\u03c0\u03a3\n, m2\u03c0 , M\u03a3\n)\n2M\u03c0\u03a3\n\n(2)\n\nwith the K\u00e4llen function \u03bb(x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 2xy \u2212\n2yz \u2212 2zx.\nThe \u039b(1405) production is investigated by limiting the\nkinematics with the invariant mass of the final \u03c0\u03a3 state\naround 1350 to 1450 MeV, in which the resonating \u03c0\u03a3\nforms the \u039b(1405) and the resonance contribution may\ndominate the cross section. Thus, we do not consider the\ndiagrams in which the final \u03c0 and \u03a3 are emitted from\ndifferent vertices, since they are not correlated. In this\n\u039b(1405) dominance approximation, we have three diagrams\nfor this reaction as shown in Fig. 2. The left diagram of\nFig. 2 expresses the \u039b(1405) production in the impulse approximation. We refer to this diagram as direct production\nprocess. The middle and right diagrams are for two-step\nprocesses with K\u0304 exchange. We refer to these diagrams as\ndouble scattering diagrams.\n\nFig. 2. Diagrams for the calculation of the K d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reaction. T1 and T2 denote the scattering amplitudes for K\u0304N \u2192\nK\u0304N and K\u0304N \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3, respectively.\n\nIn Fig. 2, T1 and T2 denote s-wave scattering amplitudes of K\u0304N \u2192 K\u0304N and K\u0304N \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3, respectively. These\namplitudes are calculated in coupled-channels approach\nbased on chiral dynamics, as we will explain later. In the\namplitude T2 , the \u039b(1405) resonance is involved. Note\nthat, in these three diagrams, the \u039b(1405) in the amplitude T2 is produced by the K\u0304N channel. For the amplitude\nT1 , the energies of interest are 1600 MeV to 1800 MeV for\nthe K \u2212 incident momenta 600 MeV/c to 1000 MeV/c in\nthe lab. frame. We do not consider double scattering diagrams with pion exchanges in which \u03a3 and \u03c0 are emitted\nseparately from the T1 and T2 amplitudes, respectively.\nSuch diagrams may give smooth backgrounds in the \u03c0\u03a3\ninvariant mass spectra. We do not consider the \u03a3(1385)\nresonance in the T2 amplitude, since the branching rate of\n\u03a3(1385) to \u03c0\u03a3 is only 12%.\nFor the energetic incident K \u2212 with several hundreds\nMeV/c momentum in the lab. frame, the contribution of\ndiagram 1 (direct production) is expected to be very small,\nsince the \u039b(1405) is produced below the K\u0304N threshold\nby the energetic K \u2212 and a far off-shell nucleon and the\ndeuteron wavefunction has tiny component of such a far\noff-shell nucleon. In contrast to the direct production, in\nthe double scattering diagrams, the large energy of the\nincident K \u2212 is carried away by the final neutron and the\nexchanged kaon can have a suitable energy to create the\n\u039b(1405) colliding with the other nucleon in the deuteron.\n\n2.2 Scattering amplitude\n\nLet us calculate the T -matrix for the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reaction. The T -matrix for the diagram 1 given in Fig. 2 can\nbe calculated in the impulse approximation in which the\nincident K \u2212 and the proton in the deuteron transform\ninto \u03c0\u03a3 and the neutron behaves as a spectator of the\nreaction.\nLetting the wavefunctions of the incident kaon and the\nparticles in the final state be given by plane waves and\nwriting the wavefunctions of the nucleons in the deuteron\nas \u03c6i (i = 1, 2), we obtain the connected part of the S-\n\n\fD.

Taking the deuteron\nenergy as the sum of the energies of the nucleons, p0d =\np01 + p02 , we obtain the total energy conservation k 0 + p0d \u2212\np0\u03a3 \u2212 p0\u03c0 \u2212 p0n = 0. Here, in general, p0n 6= p02 . Thus one\nmust assume in the impulse approximation that the initial\nenergy in the deuteron is not equally distributed between\nthe two nucleons.\nTo perform the spacial integrals, we introduce the relative coordinate for x1 and x2 as R = (x1 + x2 )/2 and\nr = x1 \u2212 x2 . We also introduce the deuteron wavefunction for the relative motion \u03c6(r) and assume that the center of mass motion of the deuteron is described as the\nplane wave. Namely we replace the nucleon wavefunctions,\n\u03c61 (x1 ) and \u03c62 (x2 ), as follows:\nN1 N2 \u03c61 (x1 )\u03c62 (x2 ) \u2192 Nd eipd *R \u03c6(r)\nwhere the deuteron wavefunction is normalized as\nZ\nd3 r|\u03c6(r)|2 = 1.\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nWe neglect d-wave component of the deuteron wavefunction.

Here we have used\nagain p01 + p02 = p0d . Introducing again the relative coordinate for x1 and x2 and the deuteron wavefunction\nas Eq.

Jido et al.: Kaonic production of \u039b(1405) off deuteron target in chiral dynamics\n\nframe, that is, the laboratory frame. The deuteron is a\nloosely bound system of proton and neutron with about\n2 MeV binding energy. Neglecting the binding energy for\nthe neutron, we evaluate\nq 0 = MN + k 0 \u2212 p0n .\n\n(14)\n\nFor the determination of W1 , we recall that the wavefunction of the nucleons inside the deuteron in momentum\nspace has the largest component when the nucleon is almost at rest in the rest frame of the deuteron. Namely, in\nEq. (13), the function \u03c6\u0303 has the maximum at q = k \u2212 pn\nin the lab. frame. This fact allows us to determine W1 as\np\n(15)\nW1 = (MN + k 0 )2 \u2212 k 2 .\n\nNote that, under this assumption, the energy W1 for the\nK \u2212 n \u2192 K \u2212 n amplitude is completely fixed by kinematics without depending on the momenta of the final state.\nThus, the value of the K \u2212 n \u2192 K \u2212 n scattering amplitude\ncontributes only to the absolute value of the cross section\nand does not provide any structure in the invariant mass\nspectra. We can estimate the deviation of W1 from this\napproximation. The deuteron wavefunction \u03c6 has half of\nthe maximum value at |q + pn \u2212 k| = 45 MeV in Eq. (13).\nWith this momentum, at most, W can be change \u00b120\nMeV for the 800 MeV/c incident K \u2212 momentum. We will\ndiscuss this approximation more in Sec. 3.2.5.\nIn the same way, we can calculate the T -matrix for\ndiagram 3:\nZ\nd3 q \u03c6\u0303(q + pn \u2212 k \u2212 p2d )\nT3 = \u2212TK\u0304 0 n\u2192\u03c0\u03a3 (M\u03c0\u03a3 )\n(2\u03c0)3\nq 2 \u2212 m2K + i\u01eb\n\u00d7TK \u2212 p\u2192K\u0304 0 n (W1 ) .\n(16)\nThe negative sign in the right had side comes from the\nisospin configuration of the deuteron. Again W1 is fixed\nby Eq. (15).\nFinally, the total T -matrix is given by summing up\nthese three amplitudes:\nT = T1 + T2 + T3\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Ti (i = 1, 2, 3) are given in Eqs. (10), (13) and\n(16), respectively. Note again that, in these amplitudes Ti\n(i = 1, 2, 3), the \u039b(1405) is involved in the K\u0304N -initiated\namplitudes TK\u0304N \u2192\u03c0\u03a3 .\nWe do not consider further multiple scattering since\nwe are dealing with a deuteron break up process where\nthe final baryons go apart from each other and are weakly\ncorrelated. Also the initial kaon energy is not small. This\nsituation is very different from the coherent process of K\u0304d\nelastic scattering at threshold appearing in the evaluation\nof the K\u0304d scattering length. In this case the slow kaon\nsticks around the nucleons of the deuteron and multiple\nscattering with the two nucleons is needed in the evaluation of the scattering length [17,18,19,20]. The situation\nbears much resemblance to the case of elastic low energy\npion nucleus scattering, which requires the full solution of\nthe Klein-Gordon equation accounting for multiple scattering with the nucleons [21], and the quasielastic breakup\nprocesses which proceeds incoherently with the contribution of the first process kinemallically allowed [22].\n\n2.3 Description of the K\u0304N scattering amplitudes and\nmodel for the \u039b(1405)\nFor the description of the \u039b(1405), we use the chiral unitary approach, in which the \u039b(1405) is dynamically generated in coupled-channels of meson-baryon scattering with\nstrangeness S = \u22121 and charge Q = 0, namely K \u2212 p,\nK\u0304 0 n, \u03c0 0 \u039b, \u03c0 0 \u03a3 0 , \u03b7\u039b, \u03b7\u03a3 0 , \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a3 + , K + \u039e \u2212 and\nK 0 \u039e 0 . The scattering amplitudes for the meson-baryon\nchannels are obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the s-wave interaction kernels V given by chiral\nLagrangian. The Bethe-Salpeter equation turns out to be\nan algebraic equation of the meson-baryon coupled channels if we consider elastic unitarity in the N/D method [4]:\nTij (W ) = Vij (W ) + Vik (W )Gk (W )Tkj (W ).\n\n(18)\n\nwhere i, j are the channel indices given in Ref. [3] and W\ndenotes the center of mass energy.\nIn Eq. (18), V is given by the leading order of the chiral\nLagrangian as\nVij (W ) =\n\u2212\n\nCij\n(2W \u2212 Mi \u2212 Mj )\n4f 2\n\n\u0012\n\nMi + Ei\n2Mi\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\n\u00131/2\nMj + Ej\n(19)\n2Mj\n\nwith the baryon masses Mi and energy Ei . The coefficient\nCij in Eq. (19) is the channel coupling which is fixed by the\nflavor SU(3) group structure, and f is the\n\u221a decay constant\nof the meson in the chiral field U = exp[i 2\u03a6/f ]. Here we\nuse an averaged value of f = 1.123f\u03c0 with f\u03c0 = 93 MeV\nas done in Ref. [5] to deal with the K\u0304N interaction.\nThe diagonal matrix Gk (W ) in Eq. (18) is a mesonbaryon loop function and is evaluated with dimensional\nregularization:\nZ\nd4 q\n1\n2Mk\nGk (W ) = i\n(2\u03c0)4 (P \u2212 q)2 \u2212 Mk2 + i\u01eb q 2 \u2212 m2k + i\u01eb\n\u001a\nMk2\nm2k \u2212 Mk2 + W 2\nm2k\n2Mk\na\n(\u03bc)\n+\nln\n+\nln\n=\nk\n16\u03c0 2\n\u03bc2\n2W 2\nMk2\nq\u0304k \u0002\nln(W 2 \u2212 (Mk2 \u2212 m2k ) + 2q\u0304k W )\n+\nW\n+ ln(W 2 + (Mk2 \u2212 m2k ) + 2q\u0304k W )\n\u2212 ln(\u2212W 2 + (Mk2 \u2212 m2k ) + 2q\u0304k W )\n\u0003\n\u2212 ln(\u2212W 2 \u2212 (Mk2 \u2212 m2k ) + 2q\u0304k W )\n(20)\n\nwhere mi is the meson mass, q\u0304i is the center of mass\nmomentum and ai (\u03bc) is the subtraction constant with\na renormalization scale \u03bc. The subtraction constants are\nonly the free parameters in this model and are determined\nso as to reproduce the threshold properties of K \u2212 p to several channels [2], which were obtained by K \u2212 absorptions\nof Kaonic hydrogen [24]. In a recent work [8], it is found\nthat the values of the subtraction constant are very important to determine the nature of the dynamically generated\nresonances in the chiral unitary approach. Here we take a\nstandard parameter set given in Ref. [5]:\naK\u0304N = \u22121.84, a\u03c0\u03a3 = \u22122.00, a\u03c0\u039b = \u22121.83,\na\u03b7\u039b = \u22122.25, a\u03b7\u03a3 = \u22122.38, aK\u039e = \u22122.67,\n\n(21)\n\n\fD.

The scattering amplitudes calculated\nwith this parameter set reproduce well the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant\nmass spectrum and the total cross sections of K \u2212 p to\nseveral channels [5], and the \u039b(1405) is found to be almost\na purely dynamical state of meson and baryon [8].\nWe use the scattering amplitudes obtained in the chiral\nunitary approach described above for the K\u0304N \u2192 K\u0304N\nand K\u0304N \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3 amplitudes in Eqs.

The \u039b(1405) is successfully reproduced by meson-baryon dynamics, but the\nresonance position depends on the channels [9]. In Fig. 3,\nwe plot the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass distributions for K\u0304N \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3\nand \u03c0\u03a3 \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3 with I = 0 defined by\nd\u03c3MB\n= A|T |2 qc.m\ndM\u03c0\u03a3\n\n(22)\n\nwhere A is a constant, qc.m. is the CM momentum of the\nfinal \u03c0\u03a3 state and T is the two-body meson-baryon scattering amplitude. We also show in Fig. 3, as the histogram,\nthe experimental data of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a3 + invariant mass spectrum obtained in K \u2212 p \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at 4.2 GeV/c for\na K \u2212 beam with the restriction of the \u03a3 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant mass being between 1.6 to 1.72 GeV at which the\n\u03a3(1660) resonance (acting as a doorway of the reaction)\nis located [25].\nAs seen in Fig. 3, the line shapes of these two channel are significantly different and the peak position in the\n\u03c0\u03a3 initiated scattering is 20 MeV lower than in K\u0304N scattering. This is because \u03c0\u03a3 is so strongly correlated as\nto produce the lower mass resonance pole in these energies1 . As already discussed above, in the present process\n1\nThe importance of the strong \u03c0\u03a3 correlation in K\u0304N subthreshold scattering with S = \u22121 was recently pointed out in\nRef.

Thus, it is expected that the \u039b(1405) spectrum shape\nhas a peak around 1420 MeV instead of 1405 MeV.\nWe also remark that the \u039b(1405) line shapes are moderately different in different charged states of the \u03c0 and\n\u03a3. This is simply due to the interference of I = 0 and\nI = 1 components in the scattering amplitudes [26]. For\nlater convenience we show the mass spectra (22) for K \u2212 p\nand K\u0304 0 n to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03a3 \u2213 and \u03c0 0 \u03a3 0 in Fig. 4.\n\n\fD. Jido et al.: Kaonic production of \u039b(1405) off deuteron target in chiral dynamics\n\nFor the amplitude T1 in Fig. 2, we plot, in Fig. 5,\nthe modules of the K\u0304N scattering amplitudes in the relevant energy region to the present calculation. The K \u2212 n \u2192\nK \u2212 n amplitude appearing in diagram 2 is about a factor\n4 larger than K \u2212 p \u2192 K\u0304 0 n in diagram 3 for the energy\nrange from Ec.m. = 1600 to 1800 MeV. Thus, we expect\nthat diagram 2 gives a larger contribution than diagram\n3 for the incident K \u2212 momenta from 600 to 1000 MeV/c.\nThe dip structure around 1670 MeV in K \u2212 p \u2192 K\u0304 0 n is\ndue to the presence of the \u039b(1670) resonance with I = 0,\nwhile K \u2212 n \u2192 K \u2212 n has purely I = 1 and there is no\nstructure for the \u039b(1670).\n\n3 Results\nIn this section, we show the numerical results of the calculations for the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reaction. The \u03c0\u03a3 invariant\nmass is calculated by integrating the differential cross section (1) with respect to the angles of the final pion and\nneutron:\nZ\nMd M\u03a3 Mn\nd\u03c3\n=\n|T |2 |p\u03c0\u2217 | |pn | d cos \u03b8 (23)\n2\ndM\u03c0\u03a3\n(2\u03c0)3 2kc.m. Ec.m.\nwhere \u03b8 is the scattering angle of the neutron in the c.m.\nframe. The integrals in terms of the pion solid angle and\nneutron azimuth can be performed, since the amplitude is\nnot dependent on these angles. The T -matrix T is evaluated as a sum of the amplitudes given in Eqs. (10),\n(13) and (16).

[28]. The experiment was performed with\nK \u2212 having momenta between 686 and 844 MeV/c and the\nparticles were detected by bubble chamber.\n3.1.1 \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 invariant mass spectrum\nWe show, in Fig. 6, the \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 invariant-mass spectrum in\narbitrary units at 800 MeV/c incident K \u2212 momentum and\ncompare our theoretical calculation with the experimental\ndata.

[28] from the actual data points\ngiven in the paper. The solid line denotes our theoretical\ncalculation with the chiral unitary approach.\nThe spectrum shape obtained in this calculation agrees\nwith that of the experimental observation. Especially it is\nvery interesting to see that the peak position, which comes\nfrom the \u039b(1405) production, appears around M\u03c0\u03a3 =\n1420 MeV instead of 1405 MeV announced nominally by\nthe Particle Data Group. This is one of the strongest evidences that the resonance position of the \u039b(1405) depends\non the initial channel of meson and baryon, and supports\nthe double pole nature of the \u039b(1405), in which the higher\nstate sitting in 1420 MeV strongly couples to the K\u0304N\nchannel.\nThe bump structure seen around M\u03c0\u03a3 = 1390 MeV is\nprobably related to the p-wave contributions coming from\nthe \u03a3 \u2217 (1385) production, which we did not take into account in the present calculation. Let us estimate a possible influence of the \u03a3(1385) resonance on the \u039b(1405)\nspectrum appearing around 1420 MeV. We calculate the\n\u03a3(1385) spectrum in the Breit-Wigner formulation with\nthe mass 1385 MeV and the width 37 MeV including the\nphase space factor |p\u03c0\u2217 | |pn | as seen in Eq. (23). Summing\nup the spectra of the \u039b(1405) and \u03a3(1385) incoherently,\nwe find that the peak structure at 1420 MeV is not affected\nby the \u03a3(1385) contribution as seen in Fig. 7 (dash-dotted\nline). In this estimation, we have adjusted the height of the\n\u03a3(1385) spectrum so as to reproduce the observed bump\nstructure around 1390 MeV. For further quantitative calculations of the \u03a3(1385) spectrum, we would have to take\ninto account of the \u03a3(1385) production mechanism in the\npresent reaction and sum the amplitudes coherently, which\ncould be done by including the p-wave contributions with\n\n\fD.

Because in angular integrated cross\nsections the interference of s- and p-waves disappears, the\nincoherent sum done here should be good and the relevant\nfinding for the present work is that consideration of the\n\u03a3(1385) contribution does not distort the signal of the\n\u039b(1405) that we find.\nSince the purpose of the paper is to show that the\npeak around 1420 MeV is a reflection of the \u039b(1405) and\nis narrower than for the nominal \u039b(1405), we have done an\nalternative study assuming the shape of Fig. 7 to be made\nby two Breit Wigner distributions that add incoherently.\nA fit of excellent quality is obtained and the structure\npeaking around 1420 MeV is very similar to what we obtain theoretically from the \u039b(1405). A best fit with only\none Breit Winger structure, obviously does not reproduce\nthe peak at lower energies in Fig. 7 and is of lower quality\nthan that of the two structures.

The differences are within several MeV. The peak\npositions are insensitive to the incident K \u2212 momenta, but\nthe heights are dependent on the K \u2212 momenta.

In Fig. 10, we find\nthat the diagram 2 gives the dominant contribution to the\ntotal spectrum and that the impulse approximation diagram 1 is negligible, specially at higher incident momenta.\nThe reason why the two-nucleon processes give large contributions can be understood as follows. In the present\nreaction the \u039b(1405) is produced by the K\u0304N channel below its threshold. Thus, some amount of energy should\nbe taken out by the final neutron with energy transfer\nbetween the nucleons. In the double scattering processes\n(diagrams 2 and 3), the transferred energy is taken from\nthe initial kaon, such that the exchanged kaon carries less\nenergy than on shell. In the impulse process of the diagram 1, the energy should be transferred by the relative\nmotion of the nucleons inside the deuteron. Due to the\nsmall binding energy of the deuteron, the deuteron wavefunction has small high energy components. Therefore, the\ncontribution of the diagram 1 is negligibly small. The reason that the diagram 3 is relatively smaller than diagram\n2 is that the s-wave K \u2212 p \u2192 K\u0304 0 n amplitude in the diagram 3 is smaller than the K \u2212 n \u2192 K \u2212 n in the diagram\n2 at the present energy region as seen in Fig. 5.\n\n\fD.

Here\nwe do not multiply by a factor 3, since we consider the\nproduction cross section of each final \u03c0\u03a3 state.\nThere are two contributions for the \u039b(1405) producn\ntion. One is backward \u039b\u2217 production (\u03b8c.m.\n\u2243 0\u25e6 ) and the\nn\nother one is forward production (\u03b8c.m. \u2243 180\u25e6 ). Figure 11\nshows that large contributions to the total \u039b(1405) production come from the backward production.\nn\nThe forward \u039b\u2217 production with \u03b8c.m.\n> 150\u25e6 comes\nfrom diagram 1 in Fig. 2. As already mentioned, in this diagram the neutron inside the deuteron can be regarded as\na spectator of the \u039b(1405) production from K \u2212 p. Theren\nfore the neutron goes to the backward angles \u03b8c.m.\n> 150\u25e6 .\nOn the other hand, in the double scattering processes (diagram 2 and 3), the energetic incident kaon kicks one of\nthe nucleons in the deuteron to forward directions and\nthe exchanged kaon goes to backward angles. The recoil\n\nmomentum depends on the emitted nucleon angles and\ngets smaller with larger recoil angles. The exchanged kaon\ngoing backward produces the \u039b(1405) together with the\nother nucleon in the deuteron. Since the momentum distribution of the nucleons in the deuteron is concentrated\nat low momenta, less than 100 MeV/c, a good momentum matching to create the \u039b(1405) is achieved by small\nmomenta of the exchanged kaon, namely large momentum transfer of the incident K \u2212 to the emitted neutron.\nTherefore, in the double scattering processes, the production rate of the \u039b(1405) is dominated by the backward\nangles.\n3.2.4 Incident K \u2212 momentum dependence\nAs we have already shown in Fig. 8, the \u039b(1405) production cross section in K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 n decreases as the\nincident K \u2212 momentum increases. This is because more\nenergetic incident K \u2212 produce the \u039b(1405) less efficiently\ndue to worse momentum matching between the kaons and\nthe nucleons inside the deuteron in both direct production (diagram 1) and double scattering (diagram 2 and 3)\nprocesses.\nIn Fig. 12, we show the incident momentum dependence of the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant spectra of the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 n\nreaction. We find that the height of the resonance peak\nfor the \u039b(1405) around 1420 MeV has a strong incident\nmomentum dependence, as seen in the production cross\nsection, but the spectrum shapes do not depend on the\nincident energy.\nFor lower momenta of the incident K \u2212 , since the production cross sections of the \u039b(1405) are enhanced, one\nwould expect some advantage to observe the \u039b(1405) using low energy incident K \u2212 . This is true for not very low\nmomenta of the incident K \u2212 . For instance, we plot the \u03c0\u03a3\ninvariant mass spectra at 400 MeV/c incident K \u2212 momentum in the right panel of Fig. 13. These figures show that\nthe heights of the spectra are about five times larger than\nthose of the spectra obtained with 600 MeV/c of the incident K \u2212 , and that the spectrum shapes are very similar to\n\n\f10\n\nD. Jido et al.: Kaonic production of \u039b(1405) off deuteron target in chiral dynamics\n\neach other. Thus, using 400 MeV/c incident K \u2212 is better\nto observe the \u039b(1405) spectra. It is also seen that diagram 1 and 3 give a moderate contribution to the spectra,\nas seen in Fig. 13. We show also the angular dependence\nof the \u039b(1405) production cross sections in Fig. 14. Due\nto the substantial contribution from diagram 1, which is\nthe single step process, the \u039b(1405) is produced also at\nforward angles.\n\nFor incident K \u2212 momenta smaller than 200 MeV/c,\nthe maximum invariant mass of \u03c0\u03a3 in the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n\nreaction approaches that of the \u039b(1405) and the signal\nfor this resonance becomes unclear. Thus, it is hard to\ninvestigate the \u039b(1405) properties in this reaction with\nincident K \u2212 momenta smaller than 200 MeV/c.\nIt is important to discuss two particular cases where\nthe experiment is likely to be suggested. One of them is the\ncase of kaons at rest, which are often used in many other\nexperiments. The other one is the case of kaons coming\nfrom \u03c6 decay, which are used at FINUDA in the Frascati\nfacility. We have performed the calculations for these two\ncases, in the first one using kaons of 5 MeV/c instead of\nstopped kaons, and in the second case using kaons of 120\nMeV/c. The results can be seen in Fig. 15. For the low\nmomentum case we observe the dominance of the impulse\napproximation term, giving a large contribution close to\nthreshold which extends below threshold due to Fermi motion. The important thing to see is that the impulse approximation term is absolutely dominant and the trace of\nthe \u039b(1405) is lost in the figure. One can certainly conclude that the case of stopped kaons does not provide a\ngood set up to learn about the \u039b(1405). On the other\nhand the situation for the Frascati Laboratory is also not\nvery promissing. Although a signal of the \u039b(1405) can be\nseen, the contribution of the impulse approximation term\nis too large and distorts the signal of the resonance which\nis more clearly seen at higher energies.\n\n1200\n1000\n800\n\nTotal\nDia. 1\nDia. 2\nDia. 3\n\u03c0+\u03a3\u2212\n\n600\n\n50\n40\n30\n\n\u03c0+\u03a3\u2212\n\n20\n\n400\n10\n\n200\n0\n1400\nd\u03c3/dM\u03c0\u03a3 [\u03bcb/MeV]\n\nFor further low incident momenta, the spectra can be\ndistorted by threshold effects. We show the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant\nmass spectra for the 200 MeV/c incident K \u2212 in the left\npanel of Fig. 13. As seen in Fig. 13 for the \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 spectrum,\nthe signal of the \u039b(1405) production is distorted by the\nstrong contributions around 1440 MeV. This peak structure is produced by a threshold effect and has nothing to\ndo with any resonances. The phase space is given by the\nneutron momentum in the c.m frame of the reaction and\nthe pion momentum in the rest frame of \u03c0 and \u03a3. The\nmaximum invariant mass M\u03c0\u03a3 for the 200 MeV/c incident K \u2212 is at 1460 MeV. At the maximum invariant mass,\nthe neutron momentum becomes zero, while the pion momentum has a maximum value. Because these two factors\ncompete below the threshold, the phase space suppression\nis slow and shows up only at the invariant mass very close\nto the threshold. This creates the peak structure. For the\nincident momentum of 200 MeV/c, diagram 1 gives the\ndominant contributions, as seen in Fig. 13. This has as\na consequence that most of the \u039b(1405) is produced at\nforward angles (See Fig. 14).\n\n1400\n\n1200\n1000\n\n0\nklab=200 MeV/c\n\u2212 +\n\n\u03c0 \u03a3\n\n50\n40\n\n800\n\n30\n\n600\n\n20\n\nklab=400 MeV/c\n\u03c0\u2212\u03a3+\n\n400\n10\n\n200\n0\n1400\n1200\n1000\n\n0\n\u03c00\u03a30\n\n50\n\n\u03c00\u03a30\n\n40\n\n800\n\n30\n\n600\n\n20\n\n400\n200\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n1360 1380 1400 1420 1440 1460 1360 1380 1400 1420 1440 1460\nM\u03c0\u03a3 [MeV]\nM\u03c0\u03a3 [MeV]\n\nFig. 13. \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass spectra of K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n separately\nplotted in each diagram contribution.

(13) and (16).\nIn the present work, we have calculated the \u039b(1405) spectra under the assumption that the amplitude TK \u2212 N \u2192K\u0304N\nin the double scattering processes, diagram 2 and 3 in\nFig. 2, is factorized from the momentum integral by fixing the invariant energy of the scattering amplitude as\nEq. (15). This may be a good approximation if the amplitude TK \u2212 N \u2192K\u0304N does not change so much in the relevant\nmomentum range of the integral, which is determined by\nthe deuteron wavefunction. Inclusion of the integral momentum dependence to the scattering amplitude is expected not to affect the shape of the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass\nspectrum, since the spectral shape is determined by the\nK\u0304N \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3 scattering amplitude and its energy is fixed\nby the final state. Here we show a calculation performed\nwith the integral momentum dependence in the amplitude\nTK \u2212 N \u2192K\u0304N to see the validity of the approximation.\nIn Fig. 16, we show the \u03c0\u03a3 invariant mass spectra of\nK \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03a3 \u2212 n with the 800 MeV/c incident K \u2212 calculated without and with the integral momentum dependence of the TK \u2212 N \u2192K\u0304N amplitude in the double scattering diagrams. The calculation (the solid line) without the\nmomentum dependence of the K \u2212 N \u2192 K\u0304N amplitude is\nthe same as in the previous calculations. The momentum\n\n\fD.

As seen\nin Fig. 16, the difference between the two lines is small\nand the spectral shapes are very similar. The strength of\nthe spectra is slightly different. This is because, for the\n800 MeV/c incident K \u2212 , W1 can be 1700 MeV with the\nnucleon in the deuteron at rest, and the scattering amplitude TK \u2212 N \u2192K\u0304N has small energy dependence around\nthis energy as seen in Fig. 5. Thus, our conclusion that\nthe \u03c0\u03a3 mass spectra have a peak for the \u039b(1405) around\n1420 MeV in the K \u2212 d \u2192 \u03c0\u03a3n reaction does not change\nat all even if we include the momentum dependence into\nthe K \u2212 N \u2192 K\u0304N amplitude.\nFor the absolute value of the production of the \u039b(1405)\nin the present reaction, we could have 5% to 25 % corrections depending on the K \u2212 incident momentum from\nthe approximation of the loop momentum integral. For\ninstance, in case of the 750 MeV/c incident K \u2212 , W1 can\nbe around 1650 MeV where the K \u2212 p \u2192 K\u0304 0 n amplitude has a bump caused by the presence of the \u039b(1670)\nresonance (see Fig. 5). Due to the strong energy dependence of the K \u2212 p \u2192 K\u0304 0 n amplitude around W1 \u2243 1650\nMeV, we found the correction to be 25 % in the absolute\nvalue.
