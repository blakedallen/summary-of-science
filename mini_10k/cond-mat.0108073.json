These voltage patterns are characterized by a few junctions being in the resistive (whirling)\nstate while the rest of all junctions reside in the superconducting (libration) states. The breather states manifest\nthemselves through additional branches in the currentvoltage (I-V ) characteristics of a system4\u20137 and, moreover, can be directly visualized by using the low temperature scanning microscopy (LTSM) technique.4,5 Note\nhere, that the origin of such a dynamic localization is not\nthe presence of disorder but a peculiar interplay between\nnonlinearity and discreteness8 , and therefore, breather\nstates can play the same important role for underdamped\nJosephson junction arrays as Josephson vortices do for\nparallel arrays.9\nThe important peculiarity of inhomogeneous resistive\nstates is a strong resonant interaction with linear electromagnetic excitations, e. g. electromagnetic waves or\nlocalized electromagnetic oscillations. It was predicted\nin Ref. 7 and carefully studied in Ref. 10,11 that the resonant interaction of the breather state with electromagnetic excitations leads to resonant steps (a sharp current\nincrease) and various switching phenomena between different resistive states (voltage jumps) in the I-V curves.\nThe simplest case where inhomogeneous resistive\nstates can be obtained,3,11 is a dc current driven single\nanisotropic plaquette containing three Josephson junctions, as presented in Fig. 1. It consists of two vertical\njunctions parallel to the bias current \u03b3 direction, and\na horizontal junction in the transverse direction. The\ndynamics of the system crucially depends on two parameters: the anisotropy \u03b7 = IIcH\n, where IcH and IcV are\ncV\nrespectively the critical currents of horizontal and vertical junctions, and the discreteness parameter (normalized\ninductance of the cell), \u03b2L .\n\n<\n\nWe present a theoretical study of inhomogeneous dynamic (resistive) states in a single plaquette\nconsisting of three Josephson junctions.

These two breather states are characterized by only one (left or right) vertical junction and the\nhorizontal junction being resistive. We found also various further features of the states, e.g. resonant current\nsteps and voltage jumps, in the I-V curves. These features can be considered as \"fingerprints\" of the resonant\ninteraction of the breather state with electromagnetic oscillations (EOs). The voltage positions of the resonances\ndepend strongly on the parameters \u03b7 and \u03b2L .\nIn this Letter, we report on the properties of breather\nstates or even more specifically, on the resonant interaction of the breather states with EOs in the presence\nof an externally applied magnetic field. We show that\nthe magnetic field allows to control the strength of the\nresonant interaction just by a fine tuning of the relative\nphase shift between the Josephson current oscillations of\nthe two resistive junctions.\nIn order to quantitatively characterize the magnetic\nfield induced control we write the set of equations for the\ntime-dependent Josephson phases \u03c6v1 , \u03c6v2 and \u03c6h :\nN (\u03c6v1 ) = \u03b3 \u2212\n\n1\n\n1 v\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6v2 + \u03c6h + 2\u03c0f ) ,\n\u03b2L 1\n\n\fN (\u03c6v2 ) = \u03b3 +\nN (\u03c6h ) =\n\n1 v\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6v2 + \u03c6h + 2\u03c0f ) ,\n\u03b2L 1\n\nD(t) = \u03b42v (t) \u2212 \u03b4 h (t) and S(t) = \u03b42v (t) + \u03b4 h (t). The\nequations for D(t) and S(t) are given by:\n\n(1)\n\n1\n(\u03c6v \u2212 \u03c6v2 + \u03c6h + 2\u03c0f ) ,\n\u03b7\u03b2L 1\n\n2\nD\u0308 + \u03b1\u1e0a + \u03c9\u00b1\nD = \u2212Dh1 (t) + Sh2 (t) ,\n\u03b7\u22121 2\n\u03c9 D = \u2212Sh1 (t) + Dh2 (t) ,\nS\u0308 + \u03b1\u1e60 +\n\u03b7+1 \u00b1\n\nwhere the nonlinear operator N (\u03c6) = \u03c6\u0308 + \u03b1\u03c6\u0307 + sin(\u03c6),\nand the dissipation parameter \u03b1 determines the effective\ndamping in the system. Here, we use the inverse of the\nplasma frequency \u03c9J as the unit of time. The externally\napplied magnetic field Hext is characterized by the frus, i. e. the magnetic flux threading the\ntration f = \u03a6\u03a6ext\n0\ncell normalized to the magnetic flux quantum. These dynamic equations have been derived in Ref. 11, using the\nresistively shunted model for Josephson junctions, the\nKirchhoff's current laws and the flux quantization law.\nThe Josephson phases are naturally decomposed as follows (below we consider a particular breather case as the\nleft vertical junction is in the superconducting state):\n\u03c6v1 (t) \u2248 c1 + \u03b41v (t) ,\n\u03c6v2 (t) \u2248 \u03a9t + c2 + \u03b42v (t) ,\n\u03c6h (t) \u2248 \u03a9t + \u03b4 h (t) ,\n\nwhere\nthe\ntime\ndependent\ncoefficients\nh1 (t) = cos c22 cos(\u03a9t) and h2 (t) = sin c22 sin(\u03a9t).\nNote here that we neglected all nonresonant terms in Eq.\n(6).13\nSimilarly to a well known case of a parametrically\ndriven harmonic oscillator14 we find that in the dissipative case with two degrees of freedom (Eq. (6) ) the\nbreather state can become parametrically unstable, when\nthe Josephson phases D(t), S(t) \u2243 e\u03bbt with \u03bb > 0.\nThis instability depends on the effective amplitude of the\nparametric Josephson current oscillations hef f (f ) , and\nis determined by the condition:\nr\n\u0010c \u0011\n2\nhef f (f ) =\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)2 + 4\u03b7 cos2\n> \u03b1\u03a9\n(7)\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the breather frequency \u03a9 and the phase shifts c1\nand c2 are obtained using a dc analysis,11 i. e. neglecting\nthe Josephson phase oscillations \u03b4(t):\n\u03b3\n,\n\u03b1(1 + \u03b7)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 + 2\u03b7\n\u03b3\n,\nc1 = asin\n1+\u03b7\n\u03b2L \u03b3\u03b7\nc2 = c1 +\n+ 2\u03c0f .\n1+\u03b7\n\nMoreover, the strength of the combination resonance, as\n\u03a9 = \u03c9+ \u00b1\u03c9\u2212 , between the breather state and EOs is also\ndetermined by the parameter hef f (f ). The condition of\nthe combination resonance instability is\n\u221a\nhef f (f ) > \u03b1 \u03c9+ \u03c9\u2212 .\n(8)\n\n\u03a9=\n\n(3)\n\nThus, the applied magnetic field allows to control the\nstrength of the parametric and combination resonances\nthrough the magnetic field dependent phase shift between\ntwo Josephson current oscillations, c2 .\nTo test the obtained analysis and to show how the applied magnetic field changes the I-V curve we perform\ndirect numerical simulations of Eq. (2). Details of the\nnumerical procedure were given elsewhere.11 To establish a large dc current bias region where various types\nof resonances occur we use the discreteness parameter\n\u03b2L = 1 and the anisotropy \u03b7 = 0.5. We decreased (increased) the dc bias current and calculated the dc voltage\nV = < \u03c6\u0307v2 >. Numerically simulated I-V curves for\ndifferent values of the applied magnetic field are shown\nin Fig. 2.\nIn the absence of the magnetic field ( see Fig. 2a) we\nobserved two resonant steps labeled as A and B, and the\nswitching phenomenon (the voltage jump to the homogeneous resistive state) labeled as C. All types of resonant\ninteractions of the breather state with EOs are present\nin this I-V curve: the parametric resonance A leads to\nthe the resonant step at upper values of the dc bias \u03b3,\nthe primary resonance B leads to the resonant step at\nlower values of the dc bias \u03b3, and the voltage jump C is\nthe consequence of the combination resonance.11\n\nv\nIn Eq. (2) \u03b41,2\n(t), \u03b4 h (t) correspond to EOs excited in\nthe presence of the breather state. By making use of the\nlinearization of Eq. (1) around the breather state (2) we\nderive two characteristic frequencies of EOs:\nq\np\n|\u03c9\u00b1 | = F \u00b1 F 2 \u2212 G ,\n\nF =\n\n(6)\n\n(1 + \u03b7)\n1 + 2\u03b7\n1\n, G = cos(c1 )\n. (4)\ncos(c1 ) +\n2\n2\u03b7\u03b2L\n\u03b7\u03b2L\n\nThus, as the breather frequency \u03a9 matches any of the\nEOs frequencies, namely \u03a9 = \u03c9\u00b1 , a primary resonance\nappears, and the I-V curve displays a resonant current\nstep. Using the rotation wave approximation method\nelaborated in12 we find that the strength of the primary\nresonance is determined by the difference of two Josephson current oscillations: sin(\u03a9t+c2 )\u2212sin(\u03a9t). It leads to\nthe magnetic field dependent magnitude of the resonant\nstep \u2206\u03b3 as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc1\n\u03b2L \u03b3\u03b7\nc2\n= sin\n\u2206\u03b3 \u221d sin\n+\n+ \u03c0f\n. (5)\n2\n2\n2(1 + \u03b7)\nNext, we turn to the parametric resonant interaction\nof the breather state with EOs, as \u03a9 = 2\u03c9\u00b1 .

The dependence of the magnitude of the resonant\nsteps on the frustration f : (a) the lower resonant step (primary resonance, B). The numerical results (circles) and the\nanalytical prediction (Eq.

The values of the magnetic field are (a)\nf = 0; (b) f = \u22120.1; (c) f = 0.4. The dotted lines show the\ndependence of the characteristic frequency combinations of\nEOs on the dc bias \u03b3 (Eq. (4) ). Arrows indicate the various\nswitching processes.\n\nThe numerically simulated dependence of the magnitude of the upper resonant step A is shown in Fig.\n3b. This dependence displays a peculiar oscillation and\nis in qualitative agreement with the magnetic field dependence of hef f (f ). Moreover, as suggested by the inequality in Eq. (7) is valid, in the region of frustration\n0.2 < f < 0.37 a specific \"window\" of magnetic field occurs. In this region of the magnetic field the parametric\nresonant interaction is very weak and the resonant step A\n\nIn the presence of an applied magnetic field we find\nthat the I-V curve changes drastically. Thus, for a small\nmagnetic field f = \u22120.1 the lower voltage resonant step\nB practically disappears, but the switching phenomenon\nC becomes even stronger (Fig. 2b). In the opposite limit\nof a large magnetic field, as f = 0.4, the parametric and\n\n3\n\n\f14\n\ndisappears from the I-V curve. Note here that the width\nof the \"windows\" increases with the damping parameter\n\u03b1 (Eq. (7) ), and this allows for an accurate measurement\nof damping at low temperatures as \u03b1 is very small.\nIn the same region of frustration, a similar \"window\"\nexists for the combination resonance and correspondingly\nthe switching of the breather state to the homogeneous\nresistive state is suppressed. This effect has a peculiar\nconsequence. Because of the instability of the breather\nstate and the corresponding switching to the homogeneous resistive state ( see Fig. 2b), it can be very hard\nto experimentally observe the lower part of the I-V curve.\nHowever, in the presence of a magnetic field the breather\ncan pass this region of dc bias current and penetrate to\nthe \"forbidden\" current region.\nIn conclusion we presented an analysis and direct numerical simulations of the inhomogeneous resistive state\nin a single plaquette consisting of three Josephson junctions. We find that the I-V curve of such a breather\nstate displays peculiar features, namely resonant steps\nand voltage jumps. The magnitudes of all features are\ndetermined by the phase shift between two Josephson\ncurrent oscillations that in turn, can be controlled by an\nexternally applied magnetic field.\nWe thank A.
