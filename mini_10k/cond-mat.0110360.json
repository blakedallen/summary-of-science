[4] The excitonic states are obtained as the\nlowest-energy bound eigenstates of this Hamiltonian.\nThe exciton binding energy is calculated as the difference of energy between the lowest energy states\nwith and without the Coulomb energy. The Hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized by the Lanchos\nmethod for Kagome lattice of the finite size as large\nas 18 \u00d7 18.

Kagome and\none-dimensional lattices are obtained from triangle\nand Kagome ones, respectively, by removing transfer\nenergies shown by broken lines in (b) and (c).\n\nFigure 2 shows the calculated binding energies of\nexciton for various lattices. It is well known that the\nexciton binding energy becomes large as the dimensionality of the system decreases. As expected from\nthis result, the binding energies in two-dimensional\ntriangle and square lattices are smaller than onedimensional lattice. However, in spite that the bond\nconnection decreases in a one-dimensional lattice\ncompared to a Kagome one, the exciton binding energy in the Kagome lattice is much larger than the\none-dimensional one. To clarify the excitonic feature\nfurthermore, the calculated exciton wave functions\nare shown in Fig.3 for Kagome, one-dimensional, and\ntriangle lattices. This figure represents the spatial\ndistribution of a hole as a function of the distance,\nr, between a hole and an electron when the electron\nis fixed on the r=0 site, where the distance, r, is\nmeasured in units of lattice constant and taken along\none direction. As seen in Fig.3 the excitonic radius\nis extremely small, around two lattice sites, in the\nKagome lattice, being much smaller than the other\nlattices discussed in this paper. Apparently, these results reflect the localized nature of flat-band states,\ni.e. the conduction-band electron and valence-band\n\nCaluclated results and Disscussions\nBinding energy of exciton\n\nFirst, we consider the exciton binding energy on the\nKagome lattice. In order to characterize the Kagome\nsystem, we compare binding energies among various\nlattices. Two-dimensional Kagome, square, and triangle lattices and one-dimensional one are shown in\nFigs.1(a) to 1(c) as solid lines, respectively. It should\nbe noticed here that, by introducing transfer energies,\nt\u2032 , along broken lines in Figs.1(b) and 1(c) and gradually changing their valves from t\u2032 = 0 to t\u2032 = \u22121,\none can obtain Kagome and triangle lattices from\none-dimensional and Kagome ones, respectively. This\ntreatment enables us to study the effect of the continuous dimension reduction of a lattice on the exciton\nbinding energy from two to one by way of a Kagome\nlattice.
