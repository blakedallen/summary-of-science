Introduction\nVariable stars are fundamental tools for the\ndefinition of the astronomical distance scale\nand for tracing stellar populations in galaxies.\nThe VSNG project: Variable Stars in\nNearby Galaxies, is a collaboration between\nresearchers of Bologna, Padova, Napoli\nand Merate Observatories, who have joined\ntheir efforts and their skills to make a systematic study of the variable star populations in a number of Local Group\n(LG) galaxies. Started a few years ago,\nthe project has already gathered data\non 6 galaxies of different morphological\ntype, namely: the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC), Fornax, Leo I, Phoenix, NGC 6822\nand M31. Complete studies have been carSend offprint requests to: G. Clementini\n\u22c6\nBased on data collected with the ESO and\nHST telescopes\nCorrespondence to: INAF - Osservatorio\nAstronomico, via Ranzani 1, 40127 Bologna,\nItaly\n\nried out or are in progress for the LMC\n(Bragaglia et al. 2001, Clementini et al.\n2003a), Leo I (Held et al. 2001), and NGC\n6822 (Clementini et al. 2003b). Analysis\nhas just been started in Fornax. Feasibility\nprojects have been conducted in Phoenix,\nand M31 (Clementini et al. 2001). Many\npeople are involved in the above studies. Participation and co-authorship is described for each specific subproject.\nThe different parts of the VSNG project\nare handled by the collaborating teams according to their specific skills and expertise. Different approaches and most suited\ndata reduction and analysis strategies are\nadopted, depending on the available data:\n\u2013 Wide Field Imager (WFI) and Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT) photometric\ntime series data for Leo I, Fornax,\nPhoenix and NGC 6822 are handled\nin Padova by E.V. Held and collaborators (L. Rizzi, Y. Momany, I.\nSaviane), who developed dedicated software (Wide Field Padova Reduction\n\n\f2\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nG.

Bragaglia, G. Clementini,\nM. Maio, E. Taribello, E. Carretta,\nR.G. Gratton)\nHST data for the M31 Globular\nClusters are reduced with ROMAFOT\n(Buonanno\n&\nIannicola\n1989).\nIdentification of the candidate RR\nLyrae stars is done through comparison\nwith template light curves.\ntheoretical pulsational models are provided by the Napoli team (M. Marconi).\n\n2. The Large Magellanic Cloud\nInvolved people: G. Clementini, A.\nBragaglia, E. Carretta, L. Di Fabrizio,\nR.G. Gratton, M. Marconi, M. Maio, E.\nTaribello\nThe LMC is the first step of the astronomical distance scale. Many different distance indicators coexist in the LMC, thus\nallowing a direct comparison of the distance scale they provide. We observed 2\nfields close to the bar of the LMC with the\n1.5 m Danish telescope at ESO (La Silla)\nand obtained B,V light curves for 152 variables, among which 125 are RR Lyrae stars\n(see contribution by Maio et al. in these\nProceedings). Reddening in the two areas\nwas estimated from the pulsational properties of the RR Lyrae stars. Low resolution spectroscopy (R\u223c815) was obtained in\n2001 with FORS at the VLT for a hundred\nof the RR Lyrae stars, and for about 300\n\nclump stars. Examples of our FORS1+UT1\nspectra for RR Lyrae and clump stars in\nthe LMC are shown in Figure 1. Metal\nabundances for the RR Lyrae stars were\nderived using a revised version of the \u2206S\ntechnique (Preston 1959), as fully described\nin Gratton et al. (2003, in preparation).\nThe average metal abundance of the sample is <[Fe/H]>=\u22121.48 (\u03c3=0.29). The new\nmetal abundances and the apparent average luminosities of the RR Lyrae stars were\nused to derive the following luminositymetallicity relation:\n< V0 (RR) >= 0.214\u00d7([Fe/H]+1.5)+19.064\nThis relation is shown in Figure 2. The\ndereddened average luminosity of the RR\nLyrae stars is: < V (RR)0 >=19.06\u00b10.06\nat [Fe/H]=\u22121.5. When combined with the\nabsolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars provided by the Main Sequence Fitting of\nGalactic Globular clusters (Gratton et al.\n2002) this value gives \u03bcLMC =18.45\u00b10.09.\nA re-analysis of the distance moduli derived\nfor the LMC using various different distance indicators and techniques and the results of our LMC photometric and spectroscopic study leads to \u03bcLMC =18.515\u00b10.085,\nwith no longer dichotomy existing between short and long LMC distance scales\nClementini et al. (2003a).\n\n3. Fornax and Leo I\nInvolved people: G. Clementini, E.V. Held,\nE. Poretti, L. Rizzi, L. Baldacci, L. Di\nFabrizio, M. Maio, F. Matonti, Y. Momany,\nL. I. Saviane\nTime series B, V data for the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies Leo I and Fornax were\nobtained with the Wide Field Imager of the\n2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope.\nData reduction of the Fornax data (18 V\nand 62 B frames covering about 1/4 of the\ngalaxy) is in progress. Variable stars identification has been successfully performed\nwith ISIS2.1 on one of the 8 CCDs of the\nWFI mosaic. The search will be extended\nsoon to the other CCDs.\n\n\fG. Clementini: The VSNG project\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Spectra of RR Lyrae (panel a), and clump stars (panel b) in the bar of the LMC,\nobtained with FORS at UT1. For the RR Lyrae stars we label phases at which spectra\nwere acquired.\nFor Leo I we have 40 V , 22 B and 5\nI WFI frames covering the body of the\ngalaxy and its surrounding fields. Data\nhave been fully reduced using the Padova\npipeline for WFI frames. This consists of\nthe following steps:\n(a) bias subtraction and flat-fielding of the\ndata with MSCRED (Valdes 1997), a public package available into IRAF\n\n(b)reduction with WFPRED. This software, developed within the IRAF environment by E.V. Held and L. Rizzi, allows to\nmake:\n\u2013 photometry of Landolt standard stars\n\u2013 astrometry of the science frames in automatic way to remove geometric distortions and generate the master catalogues\n\u2013 coaddition of dithered images\n\n\f4\n\nG. Clementini: The VSNG project\n\nFig. 2. Luminosity-metallicity relation defined by RR Lyrae stars in the LMC. Filled\n(red) dots mark the double-mode pulsators in our sample (from Clementini et al. 2003a).\nDue to technical problems, our time series\nimages of Leo I were not aligned, and astrometry was used to trim the whole set\nof images to a common intersection region,\nand to remove geometrical distortions\n(c) photometry of the bias-subtracted, flatfielded images with ALLFRAME. The\npackage requires one PSF for each exposure\nfor each CCD of the mosaic. The 496 PSF's\nneeded for our 62 WFI images of Leo I were\ngenerated through a fully automatic algorithm developed in Padova. ALLFRAME\nwas then run on the pretreated images. The\npackage produces a master object list by\nfinding stars on the stack of all images,\nand performs PSF fitting photometry on\nthe individual images using the master list.\nFor each star the program returns both the\naverage magnitude and a record listing all\nmeasurements on the single frames.\nCatalogues were then moved to Bologna\nto perform the identification of the variable\nstars and the period definition. Variables\nin Leo I were first identified in the three\nCCD's hosting the main body of the galaxy\nusing the program VARFIND. VARFIND\nis a private software developed at the\n\nBologna Observatory by P. Montegriffo,\nwhich allows to pick up candidate variable\nstars from the scatter diagram of the time\nseries measurements. The code is interactively linked to GRATIS, a private software\nwhich allows to perform period search and\nstudy of single and multi-mode periodicities. GRATIS has been developed at the\nBologna Observatory by P. Montegriffo, G.\nClementini and L. Di Fabrizio.\nFor the first time RR Lyrae stars were detected in Leo I (Held et al. 2001), thus proving that the galaxy started forming stars\nat an early epoch. The distance modulus\nof Leo I derived from the luminosity level\nof the Horizontal Branch traced by the RR\nLyrae stars is: \u03bcLeoI =22.04\u00b10.14 (Held et\nal. 2001). A deeper search of variable stars\nhas been performed on the whole mosaic\nof the 8 CCDs using the ISIS2.1 package.\nResults are presented in Clementini et al.\n(2003c, in preparation).\n\n4. Phoenix and NGC 6822\nInvolved people: G. Clementini, E.V. Held,\nL. Baldacci, L. Di Fabrizio, Y. Momany, L.\nRizzi, I. Saviane\n\n\fG. Clementini: The VSNG project\n\n5\n\nFig. 3. Color-magnitude diagram of NGC 6822 (from Clementini et al. 2003b) showing\nthe location of the newly discovered RR Lyrae (filled circles) and Anomalous Cepheids\n(crosses) variable stars. Solid lines show the edges of the RR Lyrae instability strip of M\n3 (Corwin & Carney 2001), dashed lines are the the instability strip boundaries for 1.5\nM\u2299 models (Bono et al. 1997).\nBoth Phoenix and NGC6822 were observed with the VLT.\nPhoenix time series arise from archival data\nand consist of: 10 V , 7 B and 4 I frames.\nThe color magnitude diagram of Phoenix\nshows a very well defined HB (Held et al.\n2003, in preparation) at raw magnitude\nabout v \u223c 15.5, and a well defined RR\nLyrae gap around b \u2212 v \u223c 0.8. Indeed, the\n\nscatter diagram obtained with VARFIND\nclearly shows large \u03c3's corresponding to the\nRR Lyrae finger at v \u223c 15.5. Although we\nonly have a few frames for Phoenix, using\nthe scatter diagram and playing with data\nin the three different bands we were able\n(i) to identify candidate RR Lyrae stars,\nand (ii) to build up multicolor light curves\n\n\f6\n\nG. Clementini: The VSNG project\n\nthat can then be compared with RR Lyrae\ntemplate light curves.\nNGC6822 time series consist of 36 V ,\n11 B, and 4 I VLT frames. Variable star\nidentification performed with ISIS2.1 led\nto the discovery of a conspicous number of RR Lyrae stars and Anomalous\nCepheids in the galaxy. A more thorough\ndescription of the variable star identification technique and results is provided in\nBaldacci et al. (2003, these Proceedings).\nFigure 3 shows the location of the newly\ndiscovered RR Lyrae (filled circles) and\nAnomalous Cepheid (crosses) stars in the\ncalibrated color-magnitude diagram of\nNGC 6822 obtained with ALLFRAME.\nSolid lines show the edges of the RR\nLyrae instability strip of M 3 (Corwin\n& Carney 2001), dashed lines are the\ninstability strip boundaries for 1.5 M\u2299\nmodels (Bono et al. 1997). A preliminary\nestimate of the average luminosity of the\nRR Lyrae stars identified in NGC 6822 is\n< V (RR) >=24.61\u00b10.14, leading to a distance modulus of: \u03bcN GC6822 =23.35\u00b10.15,\nfor E(B-V)=0.24, [Fe/H]=\u22121.8 and\nMV (RR)= 0.57 mag (Clementini et al.\n2003b).\n\n5. M31\nInvolved people: G. Clementini, L. Federici,\nC. Corsi, C. Cacciari, M. Bellazzini, H.A.\nSmith.\nA feasibility study was performed on\narchival HST data of 4 Globular clusters\n(GCs) in the Andromeda galaxy. We used\n4 F555W and 4 F814W observations of\nfour M31 GCs to identify RR Lyrae stars.\nCandidate variables were selected from the\nVARFIND scatter diagrams for the 4 clusters. Time series data for each candidate\nvariable were then compared with template light curves of RR Lyrae stars in the\nGalactic globular cluster M3 (Carretta et\nal. 1998). We were able to identify 2, 4,\n11 and 8 such candidate RR Lyrae stars in\nG11, G33, G64 and G322, respectively, as\nfully described in Clementini et al. (2001).\n\nAcknowledgements.
