The visualizations of the plan view of the wake with\nhydrogen bubbles allow to determine local instantaneous frequencies, wavelengths and shedding\nangles from digital movie. The shedding frequency adjusts in a stepwise manner to the continuous\nvariation of the cone diameter.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe purpose of this work is to analyze the vortex shedding dynamics in the near wake of cones.\nThis configuration has been previously studied by different authors [1,2,3,4] . The main feature\nof the flow is the existence of discrete cells along the spanwise direction where the vortex\nshedding frequency is constant. The characteristic angle of vortex shedding lines has been\ndetermined by Radon transform of different images. However some problems are unclear. Is it\npossible to control the vortex dynamics from ends as in the case of the cylinder? Do the\nboundaries between cells move with time? Our experiments and image processing address these\nquestions and bring new information.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\n2.1 Water channel and cones\nExperiments have been performed in a free surface water channel. The dimensions of the water\nchannel are 2 m in the streamwise direction , 0.6 m along the vertical one and 0.5 m in the\ntransverse horizontal axis. The upstream velocity of the flow might be varied from 0.05 m/s to\n0.5 m/s with uniform velocity profile and low turbulence level. The geometry is the following\nOxyz with axis Ox along the horizontal streamwise direction, Oz vertical up and Oy horizontal\ntransverse direction. The origin O has been taken in the middle of the cone or of the cylinder.\nTwo cones made of polished brass with taper ratios 3.2 10-3 and 6.7 10-3 have been used. Along\nthe span of the small cone (L = 0.29 m) the diameter changes from d = 1.1 mm to D = 3,05 mm\nwith an average value dav = 2.075 mm. The great cone length is L' = 0,59 m ; its diameter varies\nfrom d = 1,7 mm to D = 3,6 mm. The cones are held by two metallic bar linked to a frame which\ncan be rotated in the vertical plane xOz. At the ends of the cones , two plates made of\n\"plexiglass\" have a thin thickness (5 mm) and a length 5 cm (cf. Fig. 1). In almost all the\n1\n\n\fPROVANSAL, MONKEWITZ\n\nexperiments, the upstream flow velocity was around 3 cm/s. It was selected such that the\nReynolds number is in the periodic vortex shedding regime and less than 200 where the threedimensional modes A or B [5,6] can appear in the circular cylinder wakes. The control of end\neffects was monitored by a small water stream created by suction through two pipes (visible\ndown and up of Fig. 1) . Special care has been paid to reduce the mean spanwise velocity as it\nwas done previously for the circular cylinder configuration [7] .\n2.2 Visualization method\nA small metallic wire has been located 10 cm upstream of the cone to produce a vertical line of\nsmall bubbles. The diameter of the wire (50 \u03bcm) was chosen to get an uniform visualization of\nthe flow. An electric voltage of 30 to 40 volts has been applied between the wire and a metallic\nplate set 40 cm downstream. Without any cone, the stability of the flow at low velocity has been\nchecked from observation of the bubble plane xOz. The relative transverse position of the wire\nand of the cone (or cylinder) has been modified to feed a single vortex side of the wake along the\nspan (Fig. 2) (method already used in air [8]). A blue laser sheet (\u03bb = 0,488 \u03bcm, power 2 watts)\nor the white light of a halogen spot (300 watts) illuminates the wake downstream. The laser ray is\nfocused by an optic fiber downstream of the bluff body [9]. A cylindrical lens creates a slowly\ndiverging sheet. Visualizations have been recorded with a numerical monitor \"Camescop JVC\"\nduring a time of 10 mn which corresponds to thousands of vortex shedding for the cone.\n\nFig. 1 View of the longer cone in the water channel\n2\n\n\fVORTEX SHEDDING DYNAMICS IN THE LAMINAR WAKES OF CONES\n\nThe pictures sequenced at the video frequency (25 Hz) have been processed to reduce the noise and\nartifacts. All the images have been stored with the standard RGB. The illumination by the blue laser\nlight is such that some noisy bubbles diffuse white light. The Red filter is sensitive to this\nwavelength band and might be used to suppress some parasite blue reflections. After different tests,\nwe have decided to use the grayscale version of the image RGB which includes the maximum of\ndetails. Different filters have been used to suppress noisy bubbles and to increase the signal to noise\nratio. Another operation has been used to avoid excess of luminosity of pixel on their neighbors and\nto get a better contour of images. In the final version, images are set black and white with a\ndiscrimination of the lower noisy intensity.\n\nFig. 2 Visualizations of the vortex lines in the wake of the longer cone\n\n3 ANALYSIS OF THE VORTEX SHEDDING ANGLES BY RADON TRANSFORM\n3.1 The Radon Transform\nThe analysis of characteristic vortex angles has be done by the Radon Transform [10]. In this\noperation, an image is swept by a beam for all the incidence angles and the transform gives the\nresult of the integration of all the material along each ray of the beam. This Transform involves\ntwo parameters : the angle of incidence \u03b8 perpendicular to the irradiating beam and the distance\nXr which separates this beam from the center (cf. Fig. 3).\n3\n\n\fPROVANSAL, MONKEWITZ\n\nFig. 3 Definition of the parameters of the Radon Transform\n\nThis tool is widely used in medicine . For instance, the inverse Radon Transform allows to\nreconstruct the image of a body irradiated by different parallel X rays.\n\nFig. 4 Radon Transform of a test picture (right) and the results of the transform (left with angles in degrees along the\nhorizontal axis and the distance along the vertical axis).\n\n4\n\n\fVORTEX SHEDDING DYNAMICS IN THE LAMINAR WAKES OF CONES\n\nWe have tested the validity of our algorithm developed under Matlab on different images (Fig. 4).\nWe have drawn a single horizontal line, a group of six parallel horizontal lines, another one of five\nhorizontal lines and a set of six oblique lines The horizontal lines of the picture correspond to the\nnormal angle \u03b8 = 90 \u00b0 of the Radon Transform on the left . The oblique lines give an angle near 135\u00b0\nwith a pretty good accuracy.\n3.2 Field of the vortex shedding angles \u03b8\nThe evolution of the angle \u03b8( z,t) with space and time has been investigated. The analysis has\nbeen performed on a strip parallel to the axis of the cone in the near wake where the vortex shedding\nlines are well developed without any diffusion of bubbles. The strip is composed of blocks with a\nstrong overlapping (50 %) to assess a compromise between the increase of the number of blocks and\na drastic reduction of the size.\n\nFig.5 Definition of a strip and of different blocks\n\nOn Figure 5, the dimensions of the blocks and of the strip have been oversized to make it\nvisible. In fact, the width of the strip is close to the vortex shedding wavelength around five\ndiameters. The height of each block is hundredth of the strip height. For every block, at each time\nstep, the Radon transform has an angle maximum and this value has been associated to the space and\ntime set. The three-dimensional view of the angle (Figure 6) shows clearly the locations and the time\nwhere dislocations between vortex lines occur. It is obvious that the boundary between two cells\nmove with time and space. The research of long time behavior requires a too large and complex\ncomputation to be made by Radon transform .\n5\n\n\fPROVANSAL, MONKEWITZ\n\nFig. 6 Analysis of the vortex shedding angle \u03b8(z, t) in degrees as function of space of z (pixels) and t time (number/25 s).\n\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n4.1 Determination of temporal periods T(z,t)\nThe time period T(z,t) needs to be determined at each time for every location along the axis of the\ncone. The observation of the time period field reveals singularities similar to the orientation \u03b8(z,t).\n\nFig. 7 Decomposition of strings .\n\nFig.8 T(z,t) for the long cone (thin end of the cone on the right)\n6\n\n\fVORTEX SHEDDING DYNAMICS IN THE LAMINAR WAKES OF CONES\n\nWe have developed an algorithm which gives the period from auto correlation of strings along\nthe time (Fig. 7) and processed on each image. The main difficulty is here to get the knowledge\nof the period for every point (Fig. 8) to take into account the dynamics of the vortex.\n4.2 Space \u2013time reconstruction of the wake and spectral analysis\nA line parallel to the axis of the cone has been selected in the near wake where the contrast is\ngood at any time. Figure 9 exhibits the evolution of successive intensities of this line along the\nspan.\n\nFig. 9 Space \u2013time diagram of the near wake (thin end of the cone on the right, Reaverage = 92 suction on the ends).\n\nFive cells coexist as in the experimental work of Noack [11] or in numerical simulations of cone\nwakes [12,13]. The dislocations have been pointed out by clear boxes . Their distribution is more\nregular in space and in time near the ends of the cone or near the end plates. The black or straight\nlines of the Figures 2 and 9 lead to the hypothesis that there is some propagation towards the thin end\nof the cone. The evolution of the dislocations has been more precisely described in [14,15].\n7\n\n\fPROVANSAL, MONKEWITZ\n\nThe results obtained for the vortex shedding angle \u03b8(z,t) and for the period T(z,t) show that a\ncomplete investigation must take into account the dynamics of the dislocations with time and space.\nThe spectral analysis of the fluctuation of intensity with vortex lines has been performed for each\nspanwise location of the cone (Fig. 10). The discrete values of the frequency, organized as the stairs\nof Gaster [2] are typical of different cells. We underline the fact that such a long time averaging is\ninsufficient and might lead to misunderstandings.\n\nFig. 10 Discrete variation of the frequency along the span of the cone( thin end on the right).\n\n5 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\nThe wake of a cone has been visualized and the images have been processed by different\nmethods. The vortex shedding has been characterized by angles deduced from a Radon transform\nand by a space\u2013time analysis. The time period of oscillation has been measured on every point of\nthe cone by correlation. The Fast Fourier Transform has been used to get the average frequency of\nvortex shedding process. A stair case variation has been observed. However, such a description\ndoesn't explain all the phenomena and a careful investigation of the frequency is necessary.\n\n8\n\n\fVORTEX SHEDDING DYNAMICS IN THE LAMINAR WAKES OF CONES\n\nWe are grateful to Thomas Leweke who has made available the water channel and to Jacky\nMinelli and all the team of mechanics laboratory of I.R.P.H.E. for their technical assistance.\nP.Monkewitz was supported by grants from CNRS and City of Marseills while on sabbatic leave.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n\nGaster M.
