This interaction is highly\ncontrollable and brings about peculiar effects in atomic\nBose condensates, such as \"gravitational self-binding,\"\nrotons, and density modulations leading to a supersolidlike behavior [3\u20135]. In contrast to atoms, molecules possess anisotropic polarizability and rotational structure,\nwhich renders laser-induced interactions more complex,\nand thereby offers new riches in the few- and many-body\nphysics of field-dressed ultracold gases.\nIn this contribution we study the interaction between\ntwo polar and polarizable molecules in a far-off-resonant\nlaser field. We demonstrate that an optical field gives rise\nto new types of intermolecular potentials, which exhibit a\ncrossover from the inverse-power decay at short distances\nto an oscillating long-range behavior, and whose parameters can be altered by tuning the laser intensity and frequency. Furthermore, for a wide range of field intensities\nthe problem can be described by an exactly solvable twolevel model, which leads to simple analytic expressions\nfor the effective potential energy surfaces. The theory\nis exemplified by optically-induced interactions between\n40 87\nK Rb molecules, widely employed in experiments with\nultracold polar gases [6].\nWe consider two identical diatomic molecules, 1 and 2,\nwith a dipole moment d and polarizability components,\n\u03b1k and \u03b1\u22a5 , parallel and perpendicular to the molecular\naxis. In a far-off-resonant radiative field of intensity I,\nthe rotational levels of each molecule undergo a dynamic\nStark shift, as given by the Hamiltonian [1]\nH1,2 = BJ2 \u2212\n\nI\nlab,(1,2)\nej e\u2217l \u03b1jl\n(k),\n2c\u03b50\n\n(1)\n\nlab\nwith B the rotational constant, and \u03b1jl\n(k) the dynamic\npolarizability tensor in the laboratory frame.

Given that the only\nnonzero polarizability components in the molecular frame\nare \u03b1zz = \u03b1k and \u03b1xx = \u03b1yy = \u03b1\u22a5 , and using B as a unit\nof energy, Hamiltonian (1) can be recast as:\nH1,2 = J2 \u2212 \u2206\u03b7(k) cos2 \u03b8(1,2) \u2212 \u03b7\u22a5 (k),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8(1,2) is the angle between the molecular axis and\nthe polarization vector of the laser field. The dimensionless interaction parameter \u2206\u03b7(k) = \u03b7k (k) \u2212 \u03b7\u22a5 (k) with\n\u03b7k,\u22a5 (k) = \u03b1k,\u22a5 (k)I/(2\u03b50 cB). We note that eq. (2) was\nderived in Refs. [7, 8] using the semiclassical approach\nand the rotating wave approximation. All rotational levels exhibit a constant shift of \u03b7\u22a5 , given by the second\nterm of eq. (2), which will be omitted hereafter.\nThe polarization vector of an optical field defines an\naxis of cylindrical symmetry, Z. The projection, M , of\nthe angular momentum J on Z is then a good quantum\nnumber, while J is not. However, one can use the value\nof J of the field-free rotational state, YJ,M (\u03b8, \u03c6), that\nadiabatically correlates with the hybrid state as a label,\n \u0303 so that |J,\n \u0303 M ; \u2206\u03b7i \u2192 YJ,M for \u2206\u03b7 \u2192 0.\ndesignated by J,\nFor emphasis, we also label the values of J \u0303 by tilde, e.g.\nwith 0\u0303 corresponding to J \u0303 = 0.\nInduced-dipole interaction (2) preserves parity, hybridizing states with even or odd J's,\nX J,M\n \u0303\n \u0303 M ; \u2206\u03b7i =\n|J,\ncJM (\u2206\u03b7)YJM , J + J \u0303 even,\n(3)\nJ\n\nand therefore aligns molecules in the laboratory frame.\nAligned molecules possess no space-fixed dipole moment,\nin contrast to species oriented by an electrostatic field.\nWe note that at the far-off-resonant wavelengths\nusually employed in alignment and trapping experiments (\u223c1000 nm), the dynamic polarizability \u03b1ij (k)\napproaches its static limit, \u03b1ij (0), for a number of\nmolecules, e.g. CO, N2 , and OCS.

A far-off-resonant\noptical field of sufficiently large intensity leads to formation of \"tunneling doublets\" \u2013 closely lying states of opposite parity with the same M and \u2206J \u0303 = 1 [7]. The doublet states can be mixed by extremely weak electrostatic\nfields, leading to strong molecular orientation in the laboratory frame [11, 12]. The energy gap between neighboring doublets increases\nwith the field intensity, and is\n\u221a\nproportional to 2 \u2206\u03b7 in the strong-field limit [13]. As\nwe demonstrate below, at large \u2206\u03b7 interaction between\ntwo ground-state molecules can be described within the\nlowest tunneling doublet.\nIn the absence of fields, two polar molecules interact\nvia the dipole-dipole interaction:\n(1) (2)\n\nVdd (r) =\n\nd\u0302j d\u0302l\n(\u03b4jl \u2212 3r\u0302j r\u0302l ),\nr3\n\n(4)\n\nwhere d\u0302(1,2) = d(1,2) /d are unit dipole moment vectors\nof the molecules, r\u0302 is the unit vector defining the intermolecular axis, and\n\u00131/3\n\u0012\nd2\n(5)\nr0 =\n4\u03c0\u03b50 B\nis introduced as a unit of length. In the field-free case,\ninteraction between two ground-state polar molecules has\nan isotropic asymptotic behavior, Vdd (r) = \u22121/(6r6 ).\nFar-off-resonant laser light interacts with molecular polarizability, thereby inducing oscillating dipole moments\non each of the two molecules. Retarded interaction between these instantaneous dipoles leads to an additional\nterm in the intermolecular potential [1, 2, 14],\nV\u03b1\u03b1 (k, r) =\n\nI\nlab,2\ne\u2217 \u03b1lab,1 (k)Vjl (k, r)\u03b1ln\n(k)en cos(kr),\n4\u03c0\u03b520 c i ij\n(6)\n\nd2\n,\n2\u2206\u03b1(k)B\n\n(9)\n\ncharacterizes the relative strength of the permanentdipole and induced-dipole interactions and is on the order of 102 \u2212 103 for polar alkali dimers. We note that in\neq. (6) we neglected a \"static\" term due to the coupling\nof the dipole moment of one molecule with the hyperpolarizability of another via the optical field [14, 15]. This\ninteraction is independent of k and only becomes comparable to the dipole-dipole potential (4) at much larger\nintensities (I & 1014 W/cm2 ).\nIn the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, effective interaction potentials Veff (r) are obtained by diagonalizing\nthe Hamiltonian,\nH = H1 + H2 + Vdd + V\u03b1\u03b1 ,\n\n(10)\n\nfor fixed intermolecular separations r = (r, \u03b8, \u03c6). In dimensionless units, the dipole-dipole potential (4) is on\nthe order of unity, while the strength of the opticallyinduced interaction (8) is given by \u2206\u03b7/\u03be. Therefore,\nfor the field\n\u221a strength parameter satisfying the inequality 1 \u001c \u2206\u03b7 \u001c \u03be(k), both interaction terms are much\nsmaller than the energy gap between neighboring tunneling doublets. Hence, in the basis of field-dressed states,\n|J \u03031 M1 , J \u03032 M2 i, the interaction between two ground-state\nmolecules can be treated within the lowest tunneling doublet, |0\u03030, 0\u03030i\u2013|1\u03030, 1\u03030i.

(4) and (6). At\nsmall distances, kr \u001c 1, the dominant contribution to\neq. (16) reads:\n\"r\n#\n3 \u2206\u03b7\n|1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8|\ns(\u03b8) \u00b1 G(\u2206\u03b7) ,\nVeff (kr \u001c 1) \u2248\nr3\n2 \u03be\n(17)\nwhere s(\u03b8) = sgn[1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8]. Eq.\n(17)\nreveals\nthe\npresp\nence of a critical value, \u2206\u03b7c = \u03be 2/3G(\u2206\u03b7), that determines the sign of the short-range potential (\u2206\u03b7c \u223c 65 for\nKRb). For \u2206\u03b7 < \u2206\u03b7c , eq. (17) is governed by the second\nterm in the square brackets, and the potentials are always\nattractive in the ground state and repulsive in the excited\nstate for any angle \u03b8, except for \u03b8 = \u00b1 arccos(\u00b13\u22121/2 ),\nwhere Veff (kr \u001c 1) vanishes identically, cf. Fig 2 (a), (b).\nThis behavior is qualitatively different from the dipoledipole interaction between two polar molecules oriented\n\u2191\u2191\nalong the Z axis, Vdd\n= (1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8)/r3 , whose sign\nalternates in dependence on \u03b8. On the other hand, for\n\u2206\u03b7 > \u2206\u03b7c , the sign of Veff becomes angle-dependent, due\nto the interplay between the terms in the square brack\u2191\u2191\nets of eq. (17), resulting in the behavior similar to Vdd\n:\nthe potential is attractive at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0 and repulsive at\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, cf. Fig. 2 (c), (d). Both below and above\n\u2206\u03b7c the inverse-power decay rate of Veff can be tuned by\nchanging \u2206\u03b7.\nAt large distances, kr \u001d 1, the optically-induced potential (13) is proportional to 1/r and hence dominates\n\n\f4\n\n10-6\n\n500\n\n-6\n\n-10\n\n-500\n\nX\n\n0\n\n500\n\n0 Z\n-500\n\n10-6\n\n500\n\n-10-6\n-500\n\nY\n\n0\n\n500\n\n0 Z\n-500\n\nFIG. 3.

Although in the case of kr \u001c 1\nthe \u03c6-dependence is negligible, the long-range behavior\nis strongly anisotropic in \u03c6, cf. Fig. 3. As follows from\neq. (18), the magnitude and phase of the long-range oscillations scale with \u2206\u03b7 and k respectively, and are similar\nfor the ground and excited state.\nAs one can see from Fig. 3, optically-induced potentials exhibit concentric minima. If these potential\nwells are deep enough, they will support long-range\nbound states, whose properties are completely determined by the optical field, molecular dipole moments\nand polarizabilities, and are independent of the details\nof the intermolecular potential, in a similar way to\nthe electrostatically-induced bound states predicted by\nAvdeenkov and Bohn [21]. Looking into the properties\nof these states represents a challenging theoretical and\ncomputational problem.\nIn summary, we undertook a study of intermolecular\ninteractions in the presence of an intense far-off-resonant\noptical field, and provided simple analytic expressions\nfor the resulting potential energy surfaces. Opticallyinduced potentials are highly controllable and are significantly different from the dipole-dipole interaction taking\nplace between oriented polar molecules [22]. This could\nopen a way to novel quantum phases of laser-dressed ultracold polar gases and new methods to control molecular\ncollisions in the ultracold regime.\nThe author is indebted to Bretislav Friedrich for continuous encouragement and valuable suggestions on the\nmanuscript; to Eugene Demler, Mikhail Lukin, and\nBoris Sartakov for insightful discussions; to Svetlana Kotochigova for providing dynamic polarizabilities; and to\nGerard Meijer for support.\n\n[11] B.
