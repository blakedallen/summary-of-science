General features of hot\nand dense matter are summarized in the QCD phase diagram which can be probed by ultrarelativistic heavy ion\nexperiments such as the RHIC (BNL), LHC (CERN) and\nthe planned future CBM experiment at the FAIR facility\nin Darmstadt.\nTheoretical considerations indicate that at high temperature and high baryon densities there should be a\nphase transition from ordinary hadronic matter to a chirally symmetric plasma of quarks and gluons [1]. Several issues concerning this transition are not yet clarified\n[2]. QCD in this temperature and density regime is a\nstrongly coupled theory and hence perturbation theory\ncannot be used. In the absence of a systematically improvable and converging method to approach QCD at\nfinite density one often turns to model investigations see\ne.g. [3]. These models incorporate the important chiral\nsymmetry breaking mechanism of QCD but neglect any\neffects of confinement. Only recently, certain aspects of\nconfinement based on the Polyakov loop have been incorporated in chiral effective models in a systematic fashion\n[4, 5] and interesting conclusions could be drawn (see\ne.g. [6]).\nThe most prominent finding from low-energy chiral effective models is the QCD critical end point (CEP) [7].\nCommon to almost all effective model calculations is that\nthe chiral phase transition is continuous in the low density region and discontinuous in the high density regime.\nConsequently, the endpoint where the phase transition\nceases to be discontinuous is the QCD critical end point.\n\n\u2217 E-Mail:bernd-jochen.schaefer@uni-graz.at\n\n\u2020 E-Mail:mathias.wagner@physik.tu-darmstadt.de\n\nUnfortunately, several obvious and related features such\nas the exact location of this point in the QCD phase diagram cannot be predicted by these models.\nOn the other side, lattice QCD simulations are important alternatives to effective models calculations and\ncan gain much insights in the QCD phase structure\n[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Due to the notorious sign\nproblem emerging at finite baryon density reliable predictions for QCD are still not conclusive. Even worse, recently different lattice methods that circumvent the sign\nproblem are in conflict to each other. For example, using the imaginary chemical potential method for three\nphysical quark masses no critical endpoint in the phase\ndiagram is found [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\nThe present work is an extension of a previous analysis\nwithin an effective linear sigma model (L\u03c3M) with two\nquark flavors to three quark flavors [22, 23]. The restoration of the chiral SU (3) \u00d7 SU (3) and axial U (1)A symmetries with temperature and quark chemical potentials\nare investigated. The axial U (1)A anomaly is considered\nvia an effective 't Hooft determinant in the Lagrangian\nwhich breaks the U (1)A symmetry. The restoration of\nthe U (1)A symmetry is linked to a vanishing of the topological susceptibility which can further be related to the\n\u03b7 \u2032 mass via the Witten-Veneziano relation [24, 25].\nSome results depend sensitively on the model parameters which are tuned to reproduce the vacuum phenomenology. There are model-input parameters such as\nthe \u03c3 meson mass which are poorly known experimentally. The generic findings of several parameter fits over a\nbroad range of input parameters are compared. Furthermore, the extrapolation towards the chiral limit is also\naddressed and the mass sensitivity of the chiral phase\nstructure is investigated.\nThe paper is organized as follows: after introducing the\nL\u03c3M with three quark flavors, some symmetry breaking\npatterns in the vacuum are briefly discussed. In Sec. III\nthe grand thermodynamic potential is derived in meanfield approximation. In Sec. IV a discussion of the model\n\n\f2\nparameter fits is given. Since the experimental situation\nconcerning the scalar \u03c3-meson, \u03c3(600), is not settled we\nconsider a wide range of different values of the \u03c3-meson\nmass, m\u03c3 , as input parameter. All parameter sets are\ncollected in App. A.\nFor the L\u03c3M without quarks it is known that the standard loop expansion and related approximation methods\nat finite temperatures fail and imaginary meson masses\nare generated. In our approximation no such artifacts\noccur which enables us to perform a careful and detailed\nanalysis of chiral symmetry restoration in hot and dense\nmatter. This is demonstrated in Sec. V where the pseudoscalar and scalar meson masses at finite temperatures\nand chemical potentials with and without axial U (1)A\nsymmetry breaking are investigated. All mass expressions are summarized in App. B. In addition, the scalar\nand pseudoscalar flavor mixing behavior in the medium\nis explored. Various definitions are deferred to App. C\nThe grand potential determines all thermodynamic\nproperties. The resulting phase diagrams are presented\nin Section VI where the mass sensitivity of the chiral\nphase boundaries is also explored. Subsequently, the\nshape of the chiral critical surface which confines the region of the chiral first-order transitions in the m\u03c0 -mK\nplane at the critical chemical potential is evaluated for\nseveral values of m\u03c3 . Finally, in Sec. VII a summary\nwith concluding remarks is given.\nII.\n\nLINEAR SIGMA MODEL WITH THREE\nQUARK FLAVORS\n\nThe Lagrangian, Lqm = Lq + Lm , of the SU (3)L \u00d7\nSU (3)R symmetric L\u03c3M with three quark flavors consists\nof the fermionic part\nLq = q\u0304 (i\u2202/ \u2212 g Ta (\u03c3a + i\u03b35 \u03c0a )) q\n\n(1)\n\nwith a flavor-blind Yukawa coupling g of the quarks to\nthe mesons and the purely mesonic contribution\n\u0002\n\u00032\n\u0001\nLm = Tr \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m2 Tr(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03bb1 Tr(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)\n\u00012\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03bb2 Tr \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 + c det(\u03c6) + det(\u03c6\u2020 )\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ Tr H(\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 ) .\n(2)\n\nThe column vector q = (u, d, s) denotes the quark field\nfor Nf = 3 flavors and Nc = 3 color degrees of freedom\n[26]. The \u03c6-field represents a complex (3 \u00d7 3)-matrix and\nis defined in terms of the scalar \u03c3a and the pseudoscalar\n\u03c0a meson nonet\n\u03c6 = Ta \u03c6a = Ta (\u03c3a + i\u03c0a ) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe Ta = \u03bba /2 with a = 0, . . . , 8 are the nine generators\nof the U (3) symmetry, where theq\u03bba are the usual eight\n\n2\nGell-Mann matrices and \u03bb0 =\n3 1. The generators\nTa are normalized to Tr(Ta Tb ) = \u03b4ab /2 and obey the\nU (3) algebra [Ta , Tb ] = ifabc Tc and {Ta , Tb } = dabc Tc\n\nrespectively with the corresponding standard symmetric\ndabc and antisymmetric fabc structure constants of the\nSU (3) group and\n\nfab0 = 0 , dab0 =\n\nr\n\n2\n\u03b4ab .\n3\n\n(4)\n\nChiral symmetry is broken explicitly by the last term in\nEq. (2) where\nH = T a ha\n\n(5)\n\nis a (3 \u00d7 3)-matrix with nine external parameters ha . In\ngeneral, one could add further explicit symmetry breaking terms to Lm which are non-linear in \u03c6 [27, 28] but\nthis is ignored in this work.\nDue to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the\nvacuum a finite vacuum expectation value of the \u03c6 field,\n\u03c6\u0304, is generated which must carry the quantum numbers\nof the vacuum [29]. As a consequence, only the diagonal components h0 , h3 and h8 of the explicit symmetry\nbreaking term can be nonzero. This in turn involves three\nfinite condensates \u03c3\u03040 , \u03c3\u03043 and \u03c3\u03048 of which \u03c3\u03043 breaks the\nSU (2) isospin symmetry. In the following we shall restrict ourselves to a 2 + 1 flavor symmetry breaking pattern and neglect the violation of the isospin symmetry.\nThis is reflected by the choice h0 6= 0, h3 = 0, h8 6= 0 and\ncorresponds to two degenerated light quark flavors (u, d)\nand one heavier quark flavor (s).\nBesides the explicit symmetry breaking terms h0 and\nh8 the model has five more parameters: the squared treelevel mass of the meson fields m2 , two possible quartic coupling constants \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 , a Yukawa coupling g\nand a cubic coupling constant c which models the axial\nU (1)A anomaly of the QCD vacuum. The U (1)A symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian is anomalous [30],\ni.e. broken by quantum effects. Without the anomaly\na ninth pseudoscalar Goldstone boson corresponding to\nthe spontaneous breaking of the chiral U (3)L \u00d7 U (3)R\nsymmetry should emerge. However, experimentally, the\nlightest candidate for this boson is the \u03b7 \u2032 meson, whose\nmass is of the order m\u03b7\u2032 \u223c 960 MeV which is far from\nbeing a light Goldstone boson. The explicit breaking of\nthe U (1)A symmetry is held responsible for the fact that\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 mass is considerably larger than all other pseudoscalar meson masses. This well-known U (1)A problem\nof QCD is effectively controlled by the anomaly term c\nin the Lagrangian. The comprehensive procedure of how\nto fix the parameters will be given in Sec. IV.\nDepending on the signs and values of the parameters several possible symmetry breaking patterns in the\nvacuum can be obtained (see also [28] for more details). Without explicit symmetry breaking terms, i.e. for\nH = 0, and without an explicit U (1)A symmetry breaking term, i.e. for c = 0, the Lagrangian has a global\nSU (3)V \u00d7 U (3)A \u2243 SU (3)V \u00d7 SU (3)A \u00d7 U (1)A symme-\n\n\f3\ntry if the quartic coupling \u03bb2 and m2 are positive1 . If\nthe mass parameter m2 changes sign the symmetry is\nspontaneously broken down to SU (3)V . The first quartic coupling \u03bb1 has no influence on the symmetry breaking. Because of the breaking of the U (3)A symmetry\nnine pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons arise which form the\nentire nonet consisting of three pions, four kaons, the \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 meson. The scalar nonet belongs to the SU (3)V\ngroup which has a singlet and an octet representation.\nAll masses of the octet particles are degenerate. The \u03c3\nmeson belongs to the singlet and its mass is in general\ndifferent from the masses of the other octet particles.\nBy setting c 6= 0 the effects of the U (1)A symmetry\nbreaking, caused by a nonvanishing topological susceptibility, are included and the symmetry of the Lagrangian\nis reduced to SU (3)V \u00d7 SU (3)A . Due to the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of the SU (3)A , the vacuum has a\nSU (3)V symmetry. In this case the entire pseudoscalar\noctet is degenerated and only eight Goldstone bosons appear. The \u03b7 \u2032 meson, the would-be Goldstone boson, is\nstill massive in this case. The masses of the scalar particles are not modified by the U (1)A breaking.\nWith explicit symmetry breaking terms, more precisely, for only finite h0 and h8 terms, the vacuum\nSU (3)V symmetry is explicitly broken down to the\nisospin SU (2)V symmetry since the h3 term is set to zero.\nThis symmetry pattern is already a good approximation\nto nature because the violation of the isospin symmetry\nis small anyway. The resulting ground state spectrum for\nthis symmetry pattern will be discussed in Sec. V B.\n\nexcitations to the meson masses are neglected in these approximation schemes which result in a too rapid decrease\nof the meson masses and the e.g. squared pion mass becomes negative for temperatures much below the phase\ntransition. This deficiency can be cured by self-consistent\nresummation schemes such as e.g. the Hartree approximation in the CJT formalism [34, 36] or the so-called Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) e.g. [37] and variants\nthereof. Recently, the OPT method has been frequently\napplied to the three flavor L\u03c3M with and without quarks\nat finite temperature and baryon densities [38, 39]. However, the predictive power of the OPT method depends\non how it is implemented and approximations thereof\nare made. For instance, when the external momentum of\nthe self-energy are taken on-shell a solution of the corresponding gap equation and also of the equation of state\ncease to exist above a certain temperature, particularly\nbelow the critical one. Details and some improvements\nof certain approximations in the OPT framework can be\nfound in [38, 39].\nAll these problems do not emerge in the mean-field\napproximation used here. This enables us to study the\nphase structure of the more involved three flavor model\nin great detail and in a rather simple framework.\nIn order to calculate the grand potential in mean-field\napproximation we start from the partition function. In\nthermal equilibrium, the grand partition function is defined by a path integral over the quark/antiquark and\nmeson fields\n!\nZ Y\nZ\nZ 1/T Z\n3\nE\n, (6)\nD\u03c3a D\u03c0a DqDq\u0304 exp \u2212\nZ=\nd\u03c4 d xL\n0\n\na\n\nIII.\n\nGRAND POTENTIAL\n\nIn this section, the derivation of the grand thermodynamic potential for the three-flavor model is given. We\nwill use a mean-field approximation similar to the one\nfor the two-flavor model in [22]. The mean-field approximation is simple in its application, in particular at finite\ntemperature and quark densities. Low-energy theorems,\nsuch as e.g. the Goldstone theorem or the Ward identities\nare also fulfilled at finite temperatures and densities. In\nthis way we can circumvent more advanced many-body\nresummation techniques which are usually necessary to\ncure the breakdown of naive perturbation theory due to\ninfrared divergences. For example, it is well-known that\nthe standard loop expansion or related expansion methods of the SU (3) version of the L\u03c3M with or without\nquarks break down at finite temperature and imaginary\nmeson masses are generated in the spontaneously broken phase [31, 32, 33, 34, 35].

The U (1)B is related to the baryon number and\nalways conserved which is why we have neglected it.\n\nV\n\nwhere T is the temperature and V the three-dimensional\nvolume of the system2 . For three quark flavors the Euclidean Lagrangian LE generally contains three independent quark chemical potentials \u03bcf\nLE = Lqm +\n\nX\n\n\u03bcf qf\u2020 qf .\n\nf =u,d,s\n\nDue to the assumed SU (2)V isospin symmetry we neglect\nthe slight mass difference between an u- and d-quark and\nthe light quark chemical potentials become equal. In the\nfollowing we denote the degenerated light quark quantities by an index q, i.e. the light quark chemical potential\nby \u03bcq \u2261 \u03bcu = \u03bcd , and the strange quark quantities by an\nindex s.\nThe calculation of the partition function in the meanfield approximation is performed similar to Refs. [22,\n40] for the two-flavor case. The quantum and thermal fluctuations of the mesons are neglected and the\nquarks/antiquarks are retained as quantum fields. This\nmeans that the integration over the mesonic fields in\n\n2\n\nAn irrelevant normalization constant is suppressed.\n\n\f4\nEq. (6) is dropped and the fields are replaced by their\nnon-vanishing vacuum expectation values \u03c6\u0304 = T0 \u03c3\u03040 +\nT8 \u03c3\u03048 . The remaining integration over the Grassmann\nfields yields a determinant which can be rewritten as a\ntrace over a logarithm. Evaluating the trace within the\nMatsubara formalism, the quark contribution \u03a9q\u0304q (T, \u03bcf )\nof the grand potential is obtained [41]. The ultraviolet\ndivergent vacuum contribution to \u03a9q\u0304q (T, \u03bcf ) which results from the negative energy states of the Dirac sea has\nbeen neglected here (cf. [22, 40] for further details).

For the further analysis\nit is more convenient to convert the condensates into a\npure non-strange and strange part. This is achieved by an\northogonal basis transformation from the original octetsinglet basis (\u03c30 , \u03c38 ) to the non-strange (\u03c3x ) and strange\n(\u03c3y ) quark flavor basis\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\u221a\n1\n\u03c3x\n\u03c30\n2 \u221a\n1\n=\u221a\n.\n(11)\n\u03c3y\n\u03c38\n3 1 \u2212 2\nAs a consequence, the light quark sector decouples\nfrom the strange quark sector (cf. e.g. [39]) and the quark\nmasses simplify in this new basis to\n\u221a\nmq = g\u03c3x /2 , ms = g\u03c3y / 2 .\n(12)\n\nIV.\n\nPARAMETER FITS\n\nThe L\u03c3M with three quark flavors has altogether seven\nparameters m2 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , c, g, h0 , h8 and two unknown\ncondensates \u03c3\u0304x and \u03c3\u0304y . The six parameters m2 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ,\nc, hx and hy of the mesonic potential are fixed in the\nvacuum by six experimentally known quantities. Similar to Ref. [34], we have chosen as input the low-lying\npseudoscalar mass spectrum, m\u03c0 and mK , the average\nsquared mass of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons, m2\u03b7 + m2\u03b7\u2032 , and\nthe decay constants of the pion and kaon, f\u03c0 and fK ,\nand in addition the scalar \u03c3 meson mass m\u03c3 . We can\nthen predict the scalar meson masses ma0 , m\u03ba , mf0 , the\ndifference of the \u03b7,\u03b7 \u2032 squared masses, m2\u03b7 \u2212 m2\u03b7\u2032 and the\nscalar and pseudoscalar mixing angles \u03b8S , \u03b8P .\nIn analogy to e.g. Ref. [34] the values of the condensates are determined from the pion and kaon decay constants by means of the partially conserved axial-vector\ncurrent relation (PCAC). In the strange\u2013non-strange basis they are given by\n\u03c3\u0304x = f\u03c0 ;\n\n1\n\u03c3\u0304y = \u221a (2fK \u2212 f\u03c0 ) .\n2\n\n(15)\n\nThe average squared \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 meson mass determines\nthe parameter \u03bb2 by\n\n\f5\n\n\u03bb2 =\n\n3(2fK \u2212 f\u03c0 )m2K \u2212 (2fK + f\u03c0 )m2\u03c0 \u2212 2(m2\u03b7\u2032 + m2\u03b7 )(fK \u2212 f\u03c0 )\n,\n(3f\u03c02 + 8fK (fK \u2212 f\u03c0 )) (fK \u2212 f\u03c0 )\n\nand the U (1)A anomaly breaking term c is fixed by \u03bb2\nand the difference of the pion and kaon masses squared\nvia\nc=\n\nm2K \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\u2212 \u03bb2 (2fK \u2212 f\u03c0 ) .\nfK \u2212 f\u03c0\n\n(17)\n\nNote, that without anomaly breaking, i.e. for c = 0, the\naverage \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 meson mass is not used anymore for fixing\nthe parameter \u03bb2 . It is then given by the kaon and pion\nmasses and decay constants only,\n\u03bb2 =\n\nm2K\n\nm2\u03c0\n\n\u2212\n(fK \u2212 f\u03c0 ) .\n(2fK \u2212 f\u03c0 )\n\n(18)\n\nThe input parameters from the pseudoscalar sector involve only a relation between \u03bb1 and m2 . Therefore, further input from the scalar sector is necessary. In principle\ntwo possible options are available. At first, the parameter m2 is expressed as a function of the yet undetermined\nparameter \u03bb1 . This can be achieved by using the equation for the pion mass or the kaon mass (see App. B).\nIn this way the m2 dependence of the \u03c3 meson mass\n(or of the f0 (1370) meson mass) can be transformed in\na \u03bb1 dependence since the scalar mixing angle does not\ndepend on m2 . By fixing the mass of the \u03c3 meson (or\nof the f0 (1370) meson) \u03bb1 is determined by solving the\ncorresponding equation. Afterwards, the m2 parameter\nfollows immediately, since \u03bb1 is fixed.\nThe explicit symmetry breaking terms hx and hy in\nthe non-strange\u2013strange basis are related to the pion and\nkaon masses by the Ward identities\nhx = f\u03c0 m2\u03c0 ;\n\nhy =\n\n\u221a\nf \u03c0 m2\n2fK m2K \u2212 \u221a \u03c0 .\n2\n\n(19)\n\nThese relations can be derived by using the gap equations, Eqs. (14). The last open parameter, the value of\nthe Yukawa coupling g, is fixed from the non-strange constituent quark mass\ng = 2mq /\u03c3\u0304x .\n\n(20)\n\nFor example, using for the light constituent quark mass a\nvalue of mq = 300 MeV we obtain g \u223c 6.5 and can predict\na strange constituent quark mass ms \u2248 433 MeV.\nSince the experimental situation concerning the broad\n\u03c3 (or f0 (600)) resonance is not yet clear, cf. [42], we\nwill use different input values for m\u03c3 in the range of\nm\u03c3 = 400 \u2212 1000 MeV and will investigate its mass dependence on various quantities (see also [43]). In App. A\nseveral parameter sets for different m\u03c3 values with and\n\n(16)\n\nwithout effects of the axial U (1)A anomaly are summarized (Tab. II). Furthermore, a discussion of the parameter sets with respect to spontaneous symmetry breaking\ncan be found in this appendix. The corresponding predictions of the scalar and pseudoscalar meson masses and\nmixing angles are collected in Tab. I\n\nV.\n\nCHIRAL SYMMETRY RESTORATION\n\nHaving fixed the model parameters we can now evaluate the grand potential numerically. In the following we\npresent our results for the chiral symmetry restoration\nat finite temperature and finite quark density with and\nwithout axial anomaly breaking. Throughout this section, the axial anomaly breaking term is kept constant,\nin particular, independent of the temperature and the\nchemical potentials.\n\nA.\n\nCondensates\n\nThe chiral phase structure of the underlying threeflavor model is completely governed by the total thermodynamic potential. Hence, the solution of the gap\nequations (14) determines the behavior of the condensates as a function of temperature and quark chemical\npotentials. In general, the three quark chemical potentials are independent but here we will consider symmetric quark matter and define a uniform chemical potential\n\u03bc \u2261 \u03bcq = \u03bcs .\nIn Fig. 1 the nonstrange \u03c3\u0304x and strange \u03c3\u0304y condensates are shown as a function of temperature for vanishing chemical potential \u03bc for m\u03c3 = 800 MeV. The\nreason for choosing this value for m\u03c3 will become clear\nlater on, see also App. A. The solid lines in this figure are obtained with an explicit axial U (1)A symmetry\nbreaking term while the dashed line corresponds to the\nanomaly free case, i.e. c = 0. The difference in the\nnonstrange condensate \u03c3\u0304x , caused by the anomaly, is not\nvisible in the figure. The condensates start at T = 0\nwith the fitted values, \u03c3\u0304x = 92.4 MeV and \u03c3\u0304y = 94.5\nMeV. The temperature behavior of both condensates\nshows a smooth crossover. The temperature derivative of\nthe nonstrange condensate peaks around T \u223c 181 MeV.\nThe precise value of this pseudo-critical temperature depends on the value of m\u03c3 in the vacuum. For smaller\nvalues of m\u03c3 the pseudocritical temperature decreases\n(cf. Sec. VI). The chiral transition in the strange sector\nis much smoother due to the larger constituent strange\nquark mass, ms = 433 MeV.

At \u03bcc the phase transition is of\nfirst-order and three solutions of each gap equation (14)\nappear corresponding to two degenerate minima and one\nmaximum of the effective potential. Due to the explicit\nsymmetry breaking both condensates remain always finite in the symmetric phase. The phase transition is\nmainly driven by the nonstrange condensate while the\njump in the strange condensate is negligible. Above the\ntransition for \u03bc > \u03bcc and below the strange Fermi surface at \u03bc = ms \u223c 433 MeV the strange condensate stays\nconstant. The axial anomaly has almost no influence up\nto the strange quark Fermi surface. Only for chemical\npotentials larger than \u03bc \u223c 433 MeV the strange condensate melts faster if the U (1)A symmetry breaking is\ntaken into account. For large chemical potentials this difference vanishes again and both strange condensates will\nbecome identical. Furthermore, the in-medium behavior\nof the nonstrange condensate \u03c3\u0304x is not modified by the\nanomaly.\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 2: Similar to Fig.1 but as a function of \u03bc for T = 0.\n\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) symmetry is restored more rapidly. With\naxial anomaly the strange condensate melts a little earlier\nbut only for temperatures above the transition. At very\nhigh temperatures both condensates become degenerate,\nindicating chiral SU (3) \u00d7 SU (3) symmetry restoration.\nIf one uses a temperature dependent anomaly term by\nmaking use of lattice results for the topological susceptibility which yields e.g. a decreasing anomaly term for\nincreasing temperatures, a faster effective restoration of\nthe axial symmetry can be achieved, see e.g. [44, 45].\nFor zero temperature and finite chemical potential\nboth condensates are independent of \u03bc in the broken\nphase until the Fermi surface of the light quarks is\nreached. For zero temperature the light Fermi surface\ncoincides with the light quark mass, i.e. \u03bc = mq = 300\nMeV. Before the chiral transition takes place at a critical\nchemical potential \u03bcc \u223c 352 MeV the nonstrange condensate drops by about 10% from its vacuum value as\n\nThe scalar-pseudoscalar meson spectrum\n\nIn the following the in-medium scalar and pseudoscalar\nmeson mass spectrum is analyzed. The derivation of the\nin-medium masses as well as the mass formulae are collected in App. B.\nWe start with the discussion of the mass spectrum at\nnonzero temperature and vanishing quark chemical potential. The meson masses as a function of the temperature for \u03bc = 0 are shown in Figs 3 and 4. In the left panels\nof the respective figures the U (1)A symmetry breaking is\nexplicitly taken into account while in the right panels the\nbreaking is neglected.\nThe masses of the pion and the \u03c3 meson and also the\nmasses of the \u03b7 \u2032 and the a0 meson degenerate approximately at the same temperature Tc \u223c 181 MeV. This\ntemperature behavior signals the effective restoration of\nchiral SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) symmetry in the non-strange sector via a smooth crossover transition. The chiral partners\n(K, \u03ba) show a similar temperature behavior but degenerate with the \u03b7 meson at a higher temperature T \u223c 240\nMeV. At the chiral transition T \u223c 181 MeV the \u03ba meson\nbecomes lighter than the a0 meson. In contrast to [34]\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 is always heavier than the kaon for all temperatures. Only the f0 (1370) meson mass does not show a\ntendency to converge to the \u03b7 mass in the temperature\nregion shown because chiral symmetry in the strange sector is restored only very slowly. The intersection point of\nthe f0 and the \u03b7 mass coincides with the inflection point\nof the strange condensate. Nevertheless, the f0 meson\nwill degenerate with the remaining meson octet at very\nlarge temperatures.\nThe mass gap in the restored phase for T > Tc between\nthe two sets of the chiral partners, (\u03c3, \u03c0) and (a0 , \u03b7 \u2032 ), i.e.\nm\u03c0 = m\u03c3 < ma0 = m\u03b7\u2032 is a consequence of the U (1)A\nbreaking term.

It is basically given by 2c\u03c3\u0304y ,\ni.e. proportional to the anomaly term c and the strange\norder parameter \u03c3\u0304y . The non-strange condensate \u03c3\u0304x is\nalready negligible for temperatures above Tc . For higher\ntemperatures (T \u226b 400 MeV) the U (1)A symmetry gets\neffectively restored and the mass gap between the chiral\npartners will vanish. Finally, for very large temperatures\ncompared to the strange quark mass the difference between the strange and non-strange mesons disappear and\nall meson masses will degenerate.\nWithout U (1)A symmetry breaking the mass gap between the chiral partners, (\u03c3, \u03c0) and (a0 , \u03b7 \u2032 ) vanishes in\nthe restored phase and all four meson masses degenerate\nat the same critical temperature Tc \u223c 181 MeV coinciding with the inflection point of the non-strange condensate. Above this temperature the axial symmetry\nis restored but the full restoration of the U (3) \u00d7 U (3)\nsymmetry is still not yet completed because the chiral\npartners (K, \u03ba) degenerate with the \u03b7 at a higher tem-\n\nperature T \u223c 240 MeV. This temperature value and the\nvalue of Tc are not changed by the anomaly as expected\nsince the non-strange condensate is not influenced by the\nanomaly. Interestingly, a recent mean-field study within\nthe three-flavor NJL model with various effective U (1)A\nanomaly implementations found an explicit difference for\nthe chiral non-strange transition temperatures with and\nwithout explicit U (1)A symmetry breaking (cf. Tab. III\nin [45]).\nAs for the case with anomaly, the chiral partners (\u03b7, f0 )\ndegenerate but only for temperatures around 300 MeV\nbecause these mesons are purely strange states and chiral symmetry in the strange sector is very slowly restored.\nA mild anomaly dependence of the intersection point of\nthe f0 and the \u03b7 meson is observed. There is no inverse\nmass ordering of the \u03b7 meson and the kaon at finite temperature as found in [34]. In the vacuum the mass of the\nf0 increases by about 60 MeV if the anomaly is neglected.\nWithout the anomaly term the \u03b7 \u2032 meson degenerates\n\n\f8\nwith the pion already in the vacuum and stays degenerated with the pion for all temperatures. Hence, in the\nvacuum the mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 drops down considerably from\n963 MeV to 138 MeV. In fact, it has\u221abeen shown that\nthe mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 must be less then 3m\u03c0 \u223c 240 MeV\nif the U (1)A symmetry is not explicitly broken [30].\nIn general, one can summarize the mass spectrum inmedium behavior in the following way: the bosonic thermal contributions decrease the meson masses while the\nfermionic parts increase the masses. For small temperatures the quark contribution is negligible and for\nhigh temperatures it dominates the mesonic contribution\nyielding rising and degenerate meson masses.\nAll meson masses are controlled by the two explicit\nsymmetry breaking parameter hx and hy . They are\ndetermined by the tree-level Ward identities, Eq. (19),\nwhich guarantee the Goldstone theorem at zero temperature: for vanishing external parameter hx the pion mass\nmust also vanishes because f\u03c0 is then finite. In this case,\nthe other symmetry breaking parameter hy generates\nonly a finite value for the kaon mass. Furthermore, the\nchiral limit can be reached by setting all explicit symmetry breaking parameters to zero. But in order to obtain\nfinite vacuum expectation values for the condensates the\nsymmetry must be spontaneously broken. This requires a\nnegative m2 parameter. Later, we will use several parameter fits for various values of the sigma meson mass which\npartly have a positive m2 parameter (see App. A). For\nthese parameter sets one cannot reach the chiral limit by\njust setting the explicit symmetry breaking parameters\nto zero. But these parameter sets are still well suited for\nfitting the physical mass point. For instance, choosing a\nm\u03c3 = 400 MeV the parameter fit results with or without\nanomaly in a positive m2 parameter and the chiral limit\ncannot be reached for this parameter set. In [34] another\nstrategy to investigate the chiral limit was adopted by\nperforming a separate extra parameter fit where an average of the experimental mass values in the scalar octet\nspectrum together with some extrapolated quantities towards the chiral limit as input have been used. However,\nall in all the extrapolation towards the chiral limit remains questionable for both procedures.\nFor the parameter set with e.g. m\u03c3 = 800 MeV we can\nreach the chiral limit. For c 6= 0 we obtain a massless\npseudoscalar octet and a finite m\u03b7\u2032 = 767 MeV due to the\nU (1)A symmetry breaking. All scalar octet masses are\ndegenerate at 840 MeV and the mass of the sigma meson\ndrops down to 620 MeV. Moreover, without U (1)A symmetry breaking all nine pseudoscalar mesons are massless\nand the scalar octet masses are degenerated into 780 MeV\nand m\u03c3 = 712 MeV.\nIn our approximation the Goldstone's theorem is also\nvalid at finite temperature and chemical potentials,\nmeaning that in the chiral limit the masses of the Goldstone bosons stay massless in the broken phase. Even in\nthe presence of quarks both Ward identities in (19) are\nalways fulfilled for all temperatures and quark chemical\npotentials which can be shown analytically.\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n-60\n\n\u0398p w/ U(1)A\n\u0398p w/o U(1)A\n\u0398s w/ U(1)A\n\u0398s w/o U(1)A\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nT [MeV]\n\nFIG. 5: The scalar \u03b8S and pseudoscalar \u03b8P mixing angles as\na function of temperature for \u03bc = 0 without and with UA (1)\nanomaly.\n\nAnother observation in the Figs 3 and 4 is the temperature behavior of the scalar \u03c3 and f0 meson around\nT \u223c 325 MeV. There is a kink visible in the curves and\nthe meson masses seem to interchange their identities for\nhigher temperatures. In order to elucidate this behavior\nwe analyze the scalar and pseudoscalar mixing angles in\nthe following.\n\nC.\n\nFlavor mixing at finite temperature\n\nThe investigation of the mixing angles of the scalar and\npseudoscalar isoscalar states provides further insights of\nthe axial U (1)A symmetry restoration. In order to clarify our findings some underlying definitions and relations\nbetween different bases are given in App. C. Both mixing angles, the pseudoscalar \u03b8P and the scalar one \u03b8S ,\nare shown in Fig. 5 as a function of temperature for\n\u03bc = 0 with and without explicit U (1)A symmetry breaking. In the broken phase, i.e. for T < 200 MeV a strong\ninfluence of the anomaly on the pseudoscalar sector is\nfound while almost no effect is seen in the scalar sector. With anomaly the nonstrange and strange quark\nstates mix and generate an pseudoscalar mixing angle\n\u03b8P \u223c \u22125\u25e6 at T = 0. For increasing temperatures the\nmixing angle stays almost constant in the chirally broken phase. Around the chiral restoration temperature\nTc \u223c 180 MeV the angle increases smoothly\ntowards\n\u221a\nthe ideal mixing angle \u03b8P \u2192 arctan 1/ 2 \u223c +35\u25e6 corresponding to \u03c6p = 90\u25e6 , where \u03c6p denotes the pseudoscalar\nmixing angle in the strange-nonstrange basis (see App. C\nfor details). At high temperatures this means that the\n\u03b7 meson becomes a purely strange and the \u03b7 \u2032 a purely\nnon-strange quark system (cf. [46]).\nThis is also demonstrated in Fig. 6 where the physical \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 and the nonstrange-strange \u03b7NS -\u03b7S complex are\nshown as a function of temperature for \u03bc = 0.

No crossing\nof the \u03b7NS and \u03b7S or anticrossing3 of the physical \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032\ncomplex is observed for all temperatures since \u03c6p (T ) is\nalways above 45\u25e6 [46].\nWithout anomaly the pseudoscalar mixing angle is already ideal for zero temperature and stays ideal for all\ntemperatures, i.e. \u03b8P \u223c +35\u25e6 . This means that already\nat T = 0 the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons are ideally flavor-mixed.\nThe \u03b7 \u2032 is a purely light quark system and the \u03b7 is a\npurely strange quark system. Without anomaly the \u03b7 \u2032\ndegenerates in mass with the pion. Hence, the \u03b7 \u2032 belongs to the class of nonstrange particles. The ordering of the corresponding nonstrange-strange masses is\nreversed, i.e. without anomaly m\u03b7S is larger than m\u03b7NS\nsince m\u03b7S = m\u03b7 and m\u03b7NS = m\u03b7\u2032 .\nIn the scalar sector the mixing angle \u03b8S shows no influence of the axial anomaly in the broken phase (see\nFig. 5). In both cases, with and without anomaly breaking, the mixing angle is almost ideal \u03b8S \u223c +31\u25e6 at T = 0\nbut the precise vacuum value depends strongly on the\nvalue for the fitted scalar sigma meson mass in contrast\nto the pseudoscalar angle which is independent of m\u03c3 ,\nsee Tab. I in App. A. For increasing m\u03c3 the scalar\n\nmixing angle \u03b8S also increases at T = 0. As a consequence, for larger m\u03c3 the nonstrange-strange \u03c3NS -\u03c3S\ncomplex and the physical \u03c3 and f0 (1370) mesons degenerate more and more at T = 0, meaning that the \u03c3 meson tends to a pure nonstrange quark system, \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3NS ,\nand the f0 to a pure strange system, f0 \u2192 \u03c3S . For instance, we obtain for m\u03c3 (mf0 ) = 400(1257) MeV respectively m\u03c3NS (m\u03c3S ) = 561(1131) MeV and for m\u03c3 (mf0 ) =\n800(1341) MeV m\u03c3NS (m\u03c3S ) = 804(1276) MeV.\nAt the chiral transition \u03b8S grows again to the ideal\none. But for temperatures around T \u223c 314 MeV in the\nchirally symmetric phase the scalar mixing angle drops\ndown to \u03b8S \u223c \u221254\u25e6 (\u03c6s \u223c 0\u25e6 ). Around these temperature the masses of the physical \u03c3 and f0 anticross and the\nones of the nonstrange-strange \u03c3NS -\u03c3S system cross. This\nis displayed in Fig. 7. Hence, for larger temperatures,\nT > 314 MeV the f0 is now a purely nonstrange quark\nsystem and the \u03c3 a purely strange state. For very large\ntemperatures, around 900 MeV, the scalar mixing angle\nturns back to the ideal \u03b8S \u223c +35\u25e6 again and a crossing\nand anticrossing of the corresponding masses takes place\nagain. Without anomaly the same phenomenon happens\nqualitatively around some larger temperatures of the order of T \u223c 325 MeV.\nFor finite quark chemical potential and vanishing temperature the mixing angle show qualitatively a similar\nbehavior. Around \u03bc \u223c 350 MeV the pseudoscalar angle \u03b8P increases towards the ideal value while without\nanomaly the angle is already ideal. In the scalar sector\nthe angle is nearly ideal in the broken phase and drops\ndown to \u03b8S \u223c \u221254\u25e6 around \u03bc \u223c 500 MeV where again\nthe masses of the physical \u03c3 and f0 meson anticross.\nA finite temperature study of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 complex including the QCD axial anomaly within a Dyson-Schwinger\napproach and a temperature-dependent topological susceptibility can also be found in [47, 48]. By means of\nthe Witten-Veneziano relation the authors studied the\n\n3\n\nA crossing of the \u03b7NS and \u03b7S masses corresponds to an anticrossing of the physical \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 masses via Eqs. (C9)-(C10) (cf. also\n[47]).\n\n\f10\ninterplay between the melting of the topological susceptibility and the chiral restoration temperature. The authors find a strong increase of the \u03b7 \u2032 mass around the chiral restoration temperature which makes the extension of\nthe Witten-Veneziano relation to finite temperature questionable. In the present work a constant anomaly parameter has been used corresponding to a constant topological susceptibility. This means that the U (1)A symmetry\nis not restored around the chiral critical temperature but\nat higher temperatures.\n\nVI.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAM AND THE CHIRAL\nCRITICAL SURFACE\n\nThe phase diagram is constructed in the following way:\nfor realistic pion and kaon masses (the so-called physical point) the light condensate melts always faster with\nT and/or \u03bc than the strange condensate because the\nstrange quark mass is heavier than the light quark mass.\nAs the chiral phase boundary we use the inflection point\nin the light condensate.\nLater on, we will also vary the meson masses and calculate the corresponding phase diagrams. As a consequence, the ordering of the light and strange condensates\ncan be inverted since the kaon mass can become lighter\nthan the pion mass. In such cases the strange condensate drops faster than the light condensate and the chiral\nphase transition is triggered by the strange condensate.\nThis has to be taken into account systematically, in particular, for the calculation of the chiral critical surface.\nThe faster melting condensate has been used in order to\nlocalize the phase boundary.\n250\n\ncrossover\n1st order\nCEP\n\nT [MeV]\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 8: Phase diagrams with U (1)A symmetry breaking for\ndifferent values of m\u03c3 = 600 MeV (lower line), 800 MeV,\n900 MeV (upper line).\n\nIn Fig. 8 the phase diagrams in the (T, \u03bc)-plane with\nexplicit U (1)A symmetry breaking for three different values of m\u03c3 are shown (lower lines correspond to m\u03c3 = 600\nMeV, next lines to m\u03c3 = 800 MeV and upper lines to\n\nm\u03c3 = 900 MeV). For each value of m\u03c3 the remaining\nparameters of the model are fitted to the vacuum as described in Sec. IV and are kept constant. Since the explicit U (1)A symmetry breaking leads only to small modifications of the phase boundaries (cf. Figs. 1 and 2), we\nrefrain from presenting the phase diagrams in the absence\nof an explicit U (1)A symmetry breaking term.\nAt zero chemical potential a crossover is always found\ndue to the explicit symmetry breaking terms. The\ncrossover temperature depends on the choice of the sigma\nmeson mass. For increasing m\u03c3 the pseudocritical temperature also increases (e.g. for m\u03c3 = 600, 800, 900 MeV\nwe found a Tc \u223c 146, 184, 207 MeV).\nRecent lattice simulations at \u03bc = 0 for three quark\nflavors have obtained values for the pseudocritical temperatures in the range of Tc = 151(3)(3) MeV [14, 49]\nand Tc = 192(7)(4) MeV [11, 50]. These results, applied\nto the current study, would suggest values for the sigma\nmass in between 600 and 800 MeV.\nAt zero temperature a first-order phase transition is\nobtained (cf. Fig. 2). For increasing temperatures the\nfirst-order transition becomes weaker and terminates in\nthe critical end point (CEP). How to measure this point\nand what the distinctive signatures of this point are is not\nyet settled. It is interesting to see that the mass of the\n\u03c3 meson as a function of temperature and/or chemical\npotential through the CEP always drops below the mass\nof the pion not only for the corresponding two flavor but\nalso for the three flavor calculation [22]. This is a general\nfeature of the L\u03c3M since the potential flattens at this\npoint in radial \u03c3 direction. In a similar NJL calculation\nthis is not the case [40, 51].\nFor m\u03c3 = 600 MeV the location of the CEP is at\n(Tc , \u03bcc ) = (91, 221) MeV and for m\u03c3 = 800 MeV at\n(63, 327) MeV. As a consequence of the model parameters\ndependence, the location of the CEP moves for increasing m\u03c3 towards the \u03bc axis. It is interesting to observe\nthat already for m\u03c3 = 900 MeV the existence of the CEP\ndisappears and the phase transition is a smooth crossover\nover the entire phase diagram.\nAlmost no influence of the axial anomaly on the phase\nboundaries and thus on the location of the CEP is seen.\nFor comparison, with and without the U (1)A symmetry\nbreaking and each for m\u03c3 = 600 MeV the location of the\nCEP changes from (Tc , \u03bcc ) = (91, 221) MeV to (89, 228)\nMeV. For m\u03c3 = 800 MeV the changes are even smaller\n(Tc , \u03bcc ) = (63, 327) MeV to (63, 328) MeV.\nIn Ref. [52] a gauged linear sigma model with chiral\nU (Nf ) \u00d7 U (Nf ) symmetry without quarks within the\n2PI resummation scheme has been considered. For the\ntwo flavor case and neglecting the influence of the vector\nmesons the opposite behavior of the chiral phase transition as a function of m\u03c3 is observed: for \u03bc = 0 a crossover\nis seen for a small \u03c3 mass (m\u03c3 = 441 MeV) and a firstorder transition for a large \u03c3 mass (m\u03c3 = 1370 MeV). If\nthe vector mesons are included the transition leads to a\nmore rapid crossover and brings one closer to the secondorder critical point. The conclusion is that the critical\n\n\f11\nendpoint moves closer to the temperature axis. Thus, the\ninclusion of vector mesons should improve the agreement\nwith lattice QCD results since usually, in chiral models\nthe critical endpoint is located at smaller temperatures\nand larger chemical potentials.\nFor three quark flavors renormalization-group arguments predict a first-order transition in the chiral limit\nindependent of the U (1)A symmetry breaking [53]. This\nbehavior is displayed in Fig. 9 where the resulting phase\ndiagrams including the anomaly for varying pion and\nkaon masses are shown for m\u03c3 = 800 MeV. We have\nchosen a path in the (m\u03c0 , mK )-plane through the physical mass point towards the chiral limit by varying the\npion mass and accordingly the kaon mass by keeping the\nratio m\u03c0 /mK fixed at the value given at the physical\npoint m\u2217\u03c0 /m\u2217K .\n250\n\ncrossover\n1st order\nCEP\n\nT [MeV]\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 9: Phase diagrams with U (1)A symmetry breaking\nfor m\u03c3 = 800 MeV and different pion masses: m\u03c0 /m\u2217\u03c0 =\n0.488 (lower line), 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.36 (upper line), m\u2217\u03c0 =\n138 MeV, m\u2217K = 496 MeV. The ratio m\u03c0 /mK = m\u2217\u03c0 /m\u2217K is\nkept fixed.\n\nThe pion and kaon masses are varied by changing the\nexplicit symmetry breaking parameters, hx and hy , while\nkeeping all remaining model parameters fixed at the values obtained at the physical point. For a pion mass\n1.36 times larger than the physical one (for m\u03c3 = 800\nMeV) the CEP lies exactly on the \u03bc-axis, hence for pion\nmasses above this value the phase transition is a smooth\ncrossover over the entire phase diagram and no CEP exists anymore.\nFor a decreasing pion mass, the location of the CEP\nmoves towards the T -axis and already for half of the physical pion mass the CEP hits the T -axis at \u03bc = 0. Remarkably also for half of the physical pion mass the CEP\nhits the T -axis in a similar calculation within a two-flavor\nL\u03c3M within the same approximation scheme but without\nU (1)A symmetry breaking and for m\u03c3 = 600 MeV [22].\nFor smaller pion masses the chiral phase transition turns\ninto a first-order one for all densities and consequently\nno CEP exists any longer.\nThe various transition lines in the phase diagram\n\nshrink towards the origin of the phase diagram for smaller\npion and kaon masses because the condensates decrease\nmore rapidly as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials. If one rescales the temperature with the\ncritical temperature at \u03bc = 0 and the chemical potential\nwith the critical chemical potential at T = 0 then all the\ntransition lines in the phase diagram lie on top of each\nother for different pion masses.\nIn connection with the existence of the CEP in the\nphase diagram it is interesting to analyze its mass sensitivity. For this purpose the critical surface for the chiral phase transition is evaluated in Fig. 10 as a function of the pion and the kaon masses with (left panel)\nand without (right panel) the U (1)A symmetry breaking. Again the masses are tuned by variation of only\nthe explicit symmetry breaking parameters (see Eq. (19))\nwhile keeping all other model parameters fixed similar to\nRef. [54]. For small kaon masses but large pion masses\nthe explicit symmetry breaking parameter for the strange\ndirection hy in Eq. (19) can become negative. The correspondingp\nkaon mass, where this happens, is given by\nmK = m\u03c0 f\u03c0 /2fK and is shown in both panels as a\nsolid line.\nThe critical surface is defined by the value of the critical chemical potential \u03bcc of the CEP for a given mass\npair (m\u03c0 , mK ). It is the surface of the second-order\nphase transition points displayed in a three-dimensional\n(\u03bcc , m\u03c0 , mK )-space. For values of the chemical potential\nabove the chiral phase transition is of first-order while\nfor values below the surface the transition lies in the\ncrossover region. With or without anomaly the critical\nsurface grows out perpendicular from the (m\u03c0 , mK )-mass\nplane at \u03bc = 0. The tangent plane to the critical surface has a decreasing slope for larger masses as expected\nfrom Fig. 8 or Fig. 9. Thus, this model study excludes\nthe so-called nonstandard scenario, found in a recent lattice analysis with imaginary chemical potentials, where\nthe first-order region shrinks as the chemical potential is\nturned on [19]. In the nonstandard scenario the bending of the critical surface has the opposite sign and the\nphysical realistic mass point remains in the crossover region for any \u03bc. In the Figure the physical mass point is\ndenoted by an arrow.\nSince the critical chemical potential \u03bcc cannot grow\narbitrarily the surface must have a boundary and hence\nstops to exist for larger (m\u03c0 , mK )-masses which are not\nshown in the Figure.\nIn Ref. [39] the L\u03c3M with quarks in an one-loop approximation, based on optimized perturbation theory,\nwas evaluated and an bending of the critical surface away\nfrom the mK -axis at m\u03c0 = 0 for a kaon masses greater\nthan 400 MeV was observed. The precise value of mK\nfor the onset of the bending depends on the order of the\nused chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7PT) for the baryon\nmass extrapolations. Thus, the unphysical bending indicates that the validity range of the \u03c7PT for the baryons,\nused for the model parameter extrapolation away from\nthe physical point, was exceeded.

The arrow points to the critical quark\np chemical\npotential at realistic pion and kaon masses (physical point). The solid line in the right panel is given by mK = m\u03c0 f\u03c0 /2fK .\n\n(tri)critical point on the mK -axis for \u03bc = 0 where the\nboundary of the first-order transition region terminates,\ncan be located.\nIn this work no strong bending of the surface away\nfrom the mK -axis is seen for kaon masses not larger than\n600 MeV but it also seems that it never approaches the\nmK -axis at least for m\u03c3 = 800 MeV. On the other hand,\nincluding the anomaly we find a critical mcrit\n\u223c 177 MeV\n\u03c0\nwhere the critical surface intersects the solid line in the\nleft panel of Fig. 10. On this line and for m\u03c0 > mcrit\nthe\n\u03c0\ntransition turns into a smooth crossover. On the contrary, without anomaly (right panel in the Figure), no\ncritical pion mass is found at \u03bc = 0 at least for values\nbelow 200 MeV. This means that the phase transition\non the solid line is still of first-order similar to the findings of [54] where the influence of the anomaly on the\nphase transition for vanishing chemical potentials within\na SU (3) \u00d7 SU (3) L\u03c3M without fermions in Hartree approximation has been investigated.\nFurthermore, the effect of the U (1)A anomaly on the\nshape of the surface is rather marginal for a kaon mass\ngreater than 400 MeV (cf. both panels in Fig. 10). For\nlarger kaon masses the strange sector decouples from the\nlight sector and the chiral phase transition is basically\ndriven by the (light) nonstrange particles.\nOn the other hand, for a kaon masses smaller than 400\nMeV we see a considerable influence of the anomaly on\nthe shape of the critical surface. Without anomaly the\nregion of first-order phase transitions at \u03bc = 0 is reduced\nwhich is in contrast to the results obtained with a L\u03c3M\nwithout quarks [54]. In this reference, it is found that\nthe first-order transition region at \u03bc = 0 grows with and\nwithout anomaly for increasing sigma masses. For sigma\nmasses greater than 600 MeV and without anomaly the\nphysical point is well located within the first-order region\nwhile it is always in the crossover region with anomaly.\nIncluding quarks we obtain an opposite tendency: the\nphysical point is always in the crossover region and for\n\nlarger sigma masses the size of the first-order transition\nregion at \u03bc = 0 decreases as can be seen from Fig. 11. In\nthis figure five crosssections, for m\u03c3 = 500 . . . 900 MeV of\nthe chiral critical surface with (left) and without anomaly\n(right panel) are shown as a function of the pion mass.\nAs a trajectory in the (m\u03c0 , mK )-plane a path through\nthe physical point towards the chiral limit has been chosen for these figures. This path is given by fixing the\npion over kaon mass ratio to the physical one, i.e. setting mK /m\u03c0 = m\u2217K /m\u2217\u03c0 where the star denotes the corresponding physical masses.\nFor larger m\u03c3 values the chiral critical surface with\nanomaly moves to smaller pion masses. This effect is\nless pronounced if the anomaly is neglected (right panel).\nIn accordance with Fig. 8 the chiral critical surface line\nfor m\u03c3 = 900 MeV terminates before the physical point\n(m\u03c0 /m\u2217\u03c0 = 1). Due to the positive m2 parameter we\ncannot evaluate the chiral critical surface for arbitrary\npion and kaon masses for smaller values of m\u03c3 as already\nmentioned. Nevertheless, the results for smaller sigma\nmasses are shown as dashed light curves in both panels\nand stop at certain pion mass ratios.\nIt is instructive to replace in the last Fig. 11 the critical chemical potential with the critical temperature and\ninvestigate its mass sensitivity. This leads to Fig. 12\nwhere the critical temperatures of the CEP's as a function of the pion mass similar to Fig. 11 are plotted for\nfive different \u03c3 meson masses with (left panel) and without anomaly (right panel). In general, the curves start\nat zero temperature and grow to a certain finite value for\ndecreasing pion masses. For the parameter sets without\nspontaneous symmetry breaking the curves with anomaly\nfor m\u03c3 = 500 and 600 MeV, and without anomaly for\nm\u03c3 = 500 MeV, show the opposite behavior. In this\ncase, i.e. for smaller values of m\u03c3 , and large unphysical pion masses m\u03c0 /m\u2217\u03c0 > 1, which is realized in lattice\nsimulations, the location of the CEP moves towards the\nT -axis.

As an effective\nrealization of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum, the SU (3)L \u00d7SU (3)R symmetric L\u03c3M\nwith quarks has been used. Within this model, the grand\nthermodynamic potential was evaluated in the mean-field\napproximation. Six of the seven model parameters are\n\nfixed to the low-lying pseudoscalar mass spectrum, which\nis experimentally well-known and to the scalar sigma meson mass. Since the experimental situation in the scalar\nsector is not very certain we have varied the value of the\nsigma mass over a wide range and have investigated its\nconsequences for the physics. The remaining model parameter, the Yukawa coupling, is determined by the nonstrange constituent quark mass while the condensates are\ngoverned by the PCAC relation.\nAt the physical mass point for various sigma masses a\nsmooth finite temperature chiral crossover at zero density and a first-order transition for finite chemical potential at zero temperature is found. The U (1)A anomaly\nhas only little influence on the strange condensate while\nno modification of the light condensate at the physical\npoint is observed. The pseudocritical crossover temperature depends on the choice of the sigma meson mass and\ncoincides with recent lattice simulations for mass values\nin between m\u03c3 = 600 . . . 800 MeV.\n\n\f14\nIn our approximation no negative squared meson\nmasses are generated in the medium as is the case for\nthe L\u03c3M without quarks. Low-energy theorems like the\nGoldstone Theorem or the Ward identities are not only\nfulfilled in the vacuum but also in the medium. This\nenables a careful analysis of the chiral symmetry restoration pattern of the meson nonets with and without axial\nanomaly. An anticrossing of the scalar \u03c3-f0 (1370) masses\nat higher temperature is seen which is reflected in the\ncorresponding mixing angle investigation.\nFor a sigma masses below 900 MeV a CEP is found in\nthe phase diagram. In contrast to a similar calculation\nin the NJL model at this point the sigma meson mass\ndrops below the pion mass. This behavior is analogous\nto the findings in the two flavor case.\nThe chiral critical surface in the (m\u03c0 , mK )-plane always has a positive slope such that the so-called nonstandard scenario can be excluded. In the chiral limit\nthe expected first-order transition at \u03bc = 0 is found.\nA large modification caused by the anomaly is visible.\nWith anomaly the first-order region in the \u03bc = 0 plane\nis enlarged for smaller masses. For larger kaon masses\nthe shape of the critical surface becomes independent of\nthe anomaly. Furthermore, for increasing m\u03c3 the surface\nbecomes steeper.\nOne drawback of the effective model used here is the\nlack of confinement properties which certainly modify the\nthermodynamics in the broken phase. A first step towards an implementation of gluonic degrees of freedom\nwhich could mimic certain confinement aspects can be\nachieved by adding the Polyakov loop to the quark dynamics. Work in this direction is in progress [55].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMW was supported by the BMBF grant 06DA123 and\nhe thanks the members of the FWF-funded Doctoral Program \"Hadrons in vacuum, nuclei and stars\" at the Institute of Physics of the University of Graz for their hospitality and support. We are grateful to D.H. Rischke and\nJ. Wambach for a careful reading of the manuscript.\n\nAPPENDIX A: PARAMETER FITS\n\nIn this appendix several used parameter fits for the\nlinear sigma model (L\u03c3M) with three quark flavors are\ncollected.\nAs experimental input we have chosen the low-lying\npseudoscalar meson mass spectrum (m\u03c0 , mK , m\u03b7 ), the\nconstituent quark mass mq and the pion and kaon decay\nconstant. To be more precise, for the fit with anomaly\n(c 6= 0) the sum m2\u03b7 +m2\u03b7\u2032 is chosen as input while for c =\n0 the m\u03b7 has not been used as input. The experimental\nvalues, taken from Ref. [42], are listed in the last line\nof Tab. I for comparison. Since the chiral \u03c3-particle is\na broad resonance its mass is not known precisely. We\n\ntherefore have used different input values for m\u03c3 in the\nrange of 400 \u2212 1000 MeV and have refitted the remaining\nparameters of the model accordingly. It is remarkable\nthat larger sigma meson masses are not adjustable since\nm\u03c3 as a function of the quartic coupling \u03bb1 saturates\naround 1100 MeV.\nIn Tab. I all resulting meson masses are listed. The\nupper block contains the fit without anomaly and the\nlower block the fit including the anomaly. Except for\nthe pseudoscalar masses the first four/five columns in\nthe table respectively, all other (scalar) masses and the\nmixing angles are predictions of the model.\nIn Tab. II the values for the six mesonic model parameters of the L\u03c3M with and without explicit U (1)A\nsymmetry breaking are summarized. The Yukawa coupling is always kept fixed to g \u223c 6.5 corresponding to\na constituent quark mass of mq = 300 MeV. For this\nYukawa coupling the strange constituent quark mass is\npredicted to be ms \u2248 433 MeV. The decay constants,\nf\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV and fK = 113 MeV, are also kept constant for all fits. It is interesting to realize that for small\nvalues of m\u03c3 and with U (1)A symmetry breaking the\nmass parameter m2 changes sign and becomes positive\nwhen fitted to realistic masses. As a consequence spontaneous symmetry breaking is lost in the chiral limit and\nall condensates will vanish in this limit. This happens for\nm\u03c3 \u2264 700 MeV. Even without anomaly breaking (c = 0)\na similar phenomenon can be seen. For this case the\nmasses are smaller when this case sets in, i.e. m\u03c3 \u2264 500\nMeV. This is the motivation for our choice of m\u03c3 = 800\nMeV. For this parameter set we can investigate the mass\nsensitivity of the chiral phase transition over arbitrarily\nexplicit symmetry breaking values including the chiral\nlimit. The choice m\u03c3 = 800 MeV for the parameter fit\nwithout anomaly is also in agreement with [34] where\nm\u03c3 = 600 MeV is a misprint in this reference. For larger\nm\u03c3 values the quartic coupling \u03bb1 increases significantly\nwhich restricts the parameter fits for m\u03c3 larger than 1000\nMeV.\n\nAPPENDIX B: MESON MASSES\n\nThe scalar J P = 0+ and pseudoscalar J P = 0\u2212 meson\nmasses are defined by the second derivative w.r.t. the corresponding scalar and pseudoscalar fields \u03c6s,a = \u03c3a and\n\u03c6p,a = \u03c0a (a = 0, . . . , 8) of the grand potential \u03a9(T, \u03bcf ),\nEq. (7), evaluated at its minimum. The minimum is\ngiven by vanishing expectation values of all scalar and\npseudoscalar fields but only two of them, \u03c3\u0304x and \u03c3\u0304y , are\nnonzero.\nm2i,ab =\n\n\u2202 2 \u03a9(T, \u03bcf )\n\u2202\u03c6i,a \u2202\u03c6i,b\n\n;\n\ni = s, p .\n\n(B1)\n\nmin\n\nIn the vacuum the contribution from the quark potential vanishes.

Hence, all quoted relations can\nbe immediately converted to the scalar (\u03c3, f0 ) complex\n\nFor an ideal scalar mixing angle \u03c6s = 90\u25e6 the \u03c3 meson\nis a pure nonstrange state \u03c3NS and f0 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3S . Furthermore, \u03c3 matches with \u03b7 \u2032 and f0 with \u03b7.\nSince the mass of the f0 meson is larger than m\u03c3 we\nobtain for an ideal mixing \u03c6s = 90\u25e6 the ordering m\u03c3S >\nm\u03c3NS .\n\n[1] B.
