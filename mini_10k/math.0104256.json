We also\ngive examples of simply connected manifolds of positive Ricci curvature\nwhich do not admit a metric of positive sectional curvature and positive\nsymmetry rank.1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn important application of index theory in Riemannian geometry is in the\nstudy of manifolds of positive scalar curvature. Soon after Atiyah and Singer\nproved the index theorem, Lichnerowicz used a Bochner type formula to show\nthat the index of the Dirac operator vanishes on closed Spin-manifolds of positive scalar curvature.\nWhereas the relation between index theory and positive scalar curvature (for\nhigh dimensional simply connected manifolds) is well understood [20, 45, 50, 38]\npossible relations to stronger curvature conditions such as positive Ricci or positive sectional curvature remain obscure (see however the fascinating conjecture\nin [51]).\nIn this paper we give obstructions to metrics of positive sectional curvature\n(positive curvature for short) with symmetry. We show that the indices of certain twisted Dirac operators vanish on a positively curved closed Spin-manifold\nM provided that the symmetry rank (i.e. the rank of the isometry group of M )\nis at least two and the dimension of M is sufficiently large. These indices occur\nas coefficients in an expansion of the elliptic genus. A similar result holds if M\nis 2-connected and the symmetry rank is \u2265 1.\nThe elliptic genus \u03c6 is a ring homomorphism from the oriented bordism ring\nto the ring of modular forms for\n\u03930 (2) := {A \u2208 SL2 (Z) | A \u2261 ( \u22170 \u2217\u2217 ) mod 2}\n(in particular, \u03c6 vanishes in all dimensions not divisible by 4). On the complex\nprojective spaces CP 2k it is given by\nX\n\u03c6(CP 2k )t2k = (1 \u2212 2\u03b4 * t2 + \u01eb * t4 )\u22121/2 ,\nk\u22650\n\n1 This\n\npaper replaces the preprint \"On the elliptic genus of positively\ncurved manifolds with symmetry\" (April 2001) which appeared at the arXiv\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0104256).\n\n1\n\n\fwhere \u03b4 and \u01eb are modular forms of weight 2 and 4, respectively.\nThe normalized elliptic genus \u03a6(M ) := \u03c6(M )/\u01ebk/2 of an oriented 4k-dimensional manifold M expands in one of the cusps of \u03930 (2) as a series of twisted\nsignatures. Following Witten [57] this series is best thought of as the index of\na hypothetical signature operator on the free loop space of M . In the other\ncusp of \u03930 (2) the elliptic genus expands as a series \u03a60 (M ) of characteristic\nnumbers. If M is Spin the coefficients of this expansion are indices of twisted\nDirac operators\nO\nO\n\u03a60 (M ) = q \u2212k/2 * \u00c2(M,\n\u039b\u2212qn T M \u2297\nSq n T M )\nn=2m+1>0\n\nn=2m>0\n\n= q \u2212k/2 * (\u00c2(M ) \u2212 \u00c2(M, T M ) * q + \u00c2(M, \u039b2 T M + T M ) * q 2 + . . . ).\nHere \u00c2(M, E) denotes the index of the Dirac operator twisted with the complexification EC of a real vector bundle E over M .\nFor a Spin-manifold M the first coefficient of the series \u03a60 (M ), the \u00c2-genus,\nvanishes if M admits a metric of positive scalar curvature [35] or if M admits\na non-trivial smooth S 1 -action [4]. Our main result asserts that additional\ncoefficients vanish if M admits a metric of positive curvature with symmetry\nrank \u2265 2.\nTheorem 1.1. Let M be a closed connected Spin-manifold of dimension >\n12r\u22124. If M admits a metric of positive curvature and symmetry rank \u2265 2r then\nthe indices of twisted Dirac operators occurring as the first (r + 1) coefficients\nin the expansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\nWe remark that all simply connected manifolds known to carry a metric of\npositive curvature have a lot of symmetry. Besides the biquotients found by\nEschenburg [14, 15] and Bazaikin [5], all other examples admit a homogeneous\nmetric of positive curvature. The latter were classified by Berger [7], Aloff,\nWallach [55, 2] and B\u00e9rard Bergery [6] (for recent progress on cohomogeneity\none manifolds see [23, 24, 46, 40, 41, 54]).\nIn the case that the symmetry rank of M is at least two Theorem 1.1 states:\nLet M be a closed connected Spin-manifold of dimension > 8. If M admits a\nmetric of positive curvature and symmetry rank \u2265 2 then \u00c2(M ) and \u00c2(M, T M )\nvanish.\nNote that the index \u00c2(M, T M ) does not vanish for the quaternionic plane. Since\nthe symmetry rank of HP 2 (with its standard metric) is three the lower bound\non the dimension of M is necessary.\nWe believe that the vanishing of \u00c2(M, T M ) also holds under weaker symmetry assumptions. For 2-connected manifolds we show\nTheorem 1.2. Let M be a closed 2-connected manifold of dimension > 8. If\nM admits a metric of positive curvature with effective isometric S 1 -action then\n\u00c2(M ) and \u00c2(M, T M ) vanish.\nThe proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 are rather indirect. For both\nstatements we study the fixed point manifold of isometric cyclic subactions. The\nBott-Taubes-Witten rigidity theorem [57, 53, 8] for elliptic genera implies that\n2\n\n\fthe codimension of the fixed point manifold is bounded from above by a constant\nwhich depends on the pole order of the expansion \u03a60 (M ) [30, 12]. Further\nrestrictions arise from the curvature assumption. A component of the fixed point\nmanifold is a totally geodesic submanifold of the positively curved manifold M .\nBy an old result of Frankel [17] totally geodesic submanifolds of sufficiently large\ndimension must intersect. This property imposes additional restrictions on the\nfixed point manifold. The consequences of the rigidity theorem and Frankel's\nresult indicated above are the main ingredients in the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and\nTheorem 1.2 which also rely on the work of Grove and Searle on isometric S 1 actions of codimension two [21] and recent work of Wilking on the connectivity\nof the inclusion of totally geodesic submanifolds [57].\nWe don't know how to prove Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 by more direct\nmethods such as the Bochner formula for twisted Dirac operators. Already for\nthe proof of the vanishing of \u00c2(M, T M ) we need to use the entire elliptic genus.\nNote that in view of the above discussion for HP 2 a Bochner type argument for\nthe vanishing of \u00c2(M, T M ) would not apply in dimension eight!\nManifolds of positive curvature (no assumptions on the symmetry) are classified in dimension < 4 [25]. In dimension \u2265 4 the only known obstructions to positive curvature are given by restrictions for the fundamental group\n(cf. [37, 52, 19], see also [43]), Gromov's Betti number theorem [19] and the\nLichnerowicz-Hitchin vanishing theorem [35, 31] for the \u03b1-invariant of Spinmanifolds.\nFurther progress concerning obstructions and classification has been obtained for positively curved manifolds with a lot of symmetry, e.g. manifolds\nwith large isometry dimension, large (discrete) symmetry rank or small cohomogeneity [32, 21, 56, 47, 22, 44, 48, 58, 42, 16, 13].\nAll these results require that the dimension of the manifold is bounded from\nabove by a constant depending on the symmetry. In contrast Theorem 1.1 and\nTheorem 1.2 only require a lower bound on the dimension of the manifold.\nTheorem 1.1 allows to distinguish positive curvature from weaker curvature\nproperties under assumptions on the symmetry rank. For example, consider\nthe product of HP 2 and a Ricci-flat K3 -surface. The Riemannian manifold\nM = HP 2 \u00d7 K3 (equipped with the product metric) has symmetry rank three\nand positive scalar curvature as well as non-negative Ricci curvature. The index\n\u00c2(M, T M ) does not vanish. Hence, if one restricts to metrics with symmetry\nrank \u2265 2 it follows from Theorem 1.1 that M admits a metric of positive scalar\ncurvature but no metric of positive curvature.\nThis kind of reasoning can be pushed further to yield examples of simply\nconnected manifolds of positive Ricci curvature which do not admit a metric\nof positive curvature if one restrict to metrics with a prescribed lower bound\non the symmetry rank (see Section 6 for precise statements). Using different\narguments (based on [12, 56]) it is possible to distinguish positive Ricci from\npositive curvature under rather mild assumptions on the symmetry. We shall\ncall an S 1 -action on a Riemannian manifold finite-order-isometric of order o if\nthe cyclic subgroup of order o acts effectively and isometrically.\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.3. For every d \u2208 N and every o \u2265 2 there exists a simply connected\nclosed manifold M of dimension greater than d such that:\n1. M admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature with finite-order-isometric\nS 1 -action of order o.\n2. M does not admit a metric of positive curvature with finite-order-isometric\nS 1 -action of order o.\nWe note that the examples (given in Section 6) admit metrics of positive Ricci\ncurvature and symmetry rank \u2265 3. In particular, one obtains simply connected\nmanifolds of positive Ricci curvature and positive symmetry rank which do not\nadmit a metric of positive curvature with positive symmetry rank.\nThe paper is structured in the following way. In the next section we review\nbasic properties of positive curvature used in the proofs of Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. In Section 3 we recall the rigidity theorem for elliptic\ngenera and discuss applications to cyclic actions. The proofs of Theorem 1.1\nand Theorem 1.2 are given in Section 4 and Section 5. In Section 4 we also\ndiscuss related results for positive kth Ricci curvature, finite isometric actions\nand integral cohomology HP k 's. In the final section we show Theorem 1.3.\n\n2\n\nGeodesic submanifolds\n\nIn this section we review basic properties of positively curved manifolds used\nin the proofs of Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. A main ingredient is an old result of Frankel on the intersection property for totally geodesic\nsubmanifolds.\nTheorem 2.1 ( [17]). Let N1 and N2 be totally geodesic submanifolds of a\npositively curved connected manifold M . If dim N1 + dim N2 \u2265 dim M then N1\nand N2 have non-empty intersection.\n\u0004\nThe proof uses a Synge type argument for the parallel transport along a geodesic\nfrom N1 to N2 which minimizes the distance. Whereas it is difficult to find\ntotally geodesic submanifolds for generic metrics they do occur naturally as fixed\npoint components in the presence of symmetry. Theorem 2.1 clearly imposes\nrestrictions on the fixed point manifold of isometric actions. The following\nconsequence is immediate.\nCorollary 2.2. Let \u03c3 be an isometry of a positively curved connected manifold\nM and let F be a connected component of the fixed point manifold M \u03c3 of minimal codimension. Then the dimension of every other component is less than\nthe codimension of F .\n\u0004\nIn [18] Frankel applied Theorem 2.1 to show that the inclusion N \u0592\u2192 M of a\ntotally geodesic submanifold of codimension k is 1-connected provided k is not\nlarger than half of the dimension of the positively curved manifold M . Recently,\nWilking generalized this result significantly using Morse theory.\n\n4\n\n\fTheorem 2.3 ([56]). Let M be an n-dimensional connected Riemannian manifold and N a connected totally geodesic submanifold of codimension k. If M is\npositively curved then the inclusion N \u0592\u2192 M is (n \u2212 2k + 1)-connected.\n\u0004\nThe theorem imposes severe restrictions on the topology. For example, if M is\nsimply connected and the codimension of N is two then either M is homeomorphic to an odd dimensional sphere or all odd Betti numbers of M and N vanish\n[56]. The case where N is fixed under an isometric S 1 -action was studied before\nby Grove and Searle.\nTheorem 2.4 ([21]). Let M be a simply connected positively curved manifold\n1\nwith isometric S 1 -action. If codim M S = 2 then M is diffeomorphic to a\nsphere or a complex projective space.\n\u0004\n\n3\n\nRigidity and cyclic actions\n\nIn this section we recall the rigidity theorem for elliptic genera and discuss\napplications to cyclic actions. For more information on elliptic genera we refer\nto [34, 29].\nA genus is a ring homomorphism from the oriented bordism ring \u03a9SO\nto a\n\u2217\nQ-algebra R [27]. The genus is called elliptic (of level 2) if its logarithm g(u) is\ngiven by a formal elliptic integral\nZ u\ndt\n\u221a\n,\ng(u) =\n1 \u2212 2 * \u03b4 * t2 + \u01eb * t4\n0\nwhere \u03b4, \u01eb \u2208 R [39]. Classical examples of elliptic genera are the signature\n(\u03b4 = \u01eb = 1) and the \u00c2-genus (\u03b4 = \u2212 81 , \u01eb = 0).\nThe ring of modular forms M\u2217 (\u03930 (2)) is a polynomial ring with generators\n\u03b4 and \u01eb of weight 2 and 4, respectively [29]. The corresponding elliptic genus\n\u03c6 : \u03a9SO\n\u2192 M\u2217 (\u03930 (2))\n\u2217\nis universal since \u03b4 and \u01eb are algebraically independent.\nAs in [57, 30] we shall consider for a 4k-dimensional oriented manifold M the\nnormalized elliptic genus \u03a6(M ) = \u03c6(M )/\u01ebk/2 which is a modular function of\nweight 0 (with Z/2Z-character). In one of the cusps (the signature cusp) \u03a6(M )\nhas an expansion which is equal to the following series of twisted signatures\nsign(q, LM ) := sign(M,\n\n\u221e\nO\nn=1\n\nS TM \u2297\nqn\n\n\u221e\nO\n\nn=1\n\n\u039bqn T M ) \u2208 Z[[q]].\n\nHere sign(M, E) denotes the index of the signature operator twisted with the\ncomplexified vector bundle EC . The series sign(q, LM ) describes the \"signature\" of the free loop space LM localized at the manifold M of constant loops\n[57].\nIn the other cusp (the \u00c2-cusp) \u03a6(M ) expands as a series of characteristic\nnumbers2\n2 For\n\na suitable change of cusps.\n\n5\n\n\f\u03a60 (M ) := q \u2212k/2 * \u00c2(M,\n\nO\n\nn=2m+1>0\n\n\u039b\u2212qn T M \u2297\n\nO\n\nSq n T M )\n\nn=2m>0\n\n= q \u2212k/2 * (\u00c2(M ) \u2212 \u00c2(M, T M ) * q + \u00c2(M, \u039b2 T M + T M ) * q 2 + . . . ).\nHere \u00c2(M, E) := h\u00c2(M ) * ch(EC ), [M ]i, where \u00c2(M ) denotes the multiplicative\nsequence for the \u00c2-genus, EC is the complexification of the vector bundle E,\n[M ] denotes the fundamental cycle and h , i is the Kronecker pairing. If M\nis Spin \u00c2(M, E) is equal to the index of the Dirac operator twisted with EC by\nthe Atiyah-Singer index theorem [3]. In this case \u03a60 (M ) has an interpretation\nas a series of indices of twisted Dirac operators (twisted Dirac-indices for short).\nThe main feature of the elliptic genus is its rigidity under actions of compact connected Lie groups. The rigidity was explained by Witten in [57] using\nheuristic arguments from quantum field theory and proved rigorously by Taubes\nand Bott-Taubes [53, 8] (cf. also [28, 36]).\nAssume the Spin-manifold M carries an action by a compact Lie group G\npreserving the Spin-structure (note that any smooth G-action lifts to the Spinstructure after passing to a two-fold covering action, if necessary). Then the\nindices occurring in the expansions of \u03a6(M ) refine to virtual G-representations\nwhich we identify with their characters. If G is connected the elliptic genus is\nrigid, i.e. the characters do not depend on G.\nTheorem 3.1 ([53, 8]). Let M be a G-equivariant Spin-manifold. If G is\nconnected then each twisted signature (resp. each twisted Dirac-index) occurring\nas coefficient in the expansion of \u03a6(M ) in the signature cusp (resp. in the \u00c2cusp) is constant as a character of G.\n\u0004\nThe rigidity of \u03a6(M ) also holds for certain non-Spin manifolds such as Spinc manifolds with first Chern class a torsion class [10] or orientable manifolds with\nfinite second homotopy group [26].\nIn the remaining part of this section we discuss consequences of Theorem\n3.1 for cyclic actions which are used in the proofs of Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2\nand Theorem 1.3.\nAssume S 1 acts on the Spin-manifold M (not necessarily preserving the\nSpin-structure). Let \u03c3 \u2208 S 1 be the element of order 2. In [30] Hirzebruch and\nSlodowy showed that the expansion of the elliptic genus in the signature cusp\ncan be expressed in terms of the transversal self-intersection M \u03c3 \u25e6 M \u03c3 of the\nfixed point manifold M \u03c3\nsign(q, LM ) = sign(q, L(M \u03c3 \u25e6 M \u03c3 )).\n\n(1)\n\nThe formula is equivalent to \u03a60 (M ) = \u03a60 (M \u03c3 \u25e6M \u03c3 ) which implies the following\ngeneralization of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch vanishing theorem [4] for the \u00c2-genus.\nTheorem 3.2 ([30]). Let M be a Spin-manifold with S 1 -action and let \u03c3 be\nthe element of order two in S 1 . If codim M \u03c3 > 4r then the first (r + 1) coefficients of \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\n\u0004\nHere codim M \u03c3 denotes the minimal codimension of the connected components\nof M \u03c3 in M .\n6\n\n\fRecall that the S 1 -action is called even if it lifts to the Spin-structure\n(otherwise the action is called odd). In the even case the codimension of\nall fixed point components of M \u03c3 is divisible by 4 whereas in the odd case\nthe codimensions are always \u2261 2 mod 4 (cf. [4], Lemma 2.4). Note that\nfor an odd action the series q dim M/8 * \u03a60 (M ) is an element in C[[q]] whereas\nq dim M/8 * \u03a60 (M \u03c3 \u25e6 M \u03c3 ) \u2208 q 1/2 * C[[q]]. Thus formula (1) implies\n\nCorollary 3.3. Let M be a Spin-manifold with S 1 -action. If the action is odd\nthen \u03a6(M ) vanishes identically.\n\u0004\n\nIn the remaining part of this section we recall a generalization of Theorem 3.2 to\ncyclic actions of arbitrary order [12]. Let M be a Spin-manifold with S 1 -action\nand let \u03c3 \u2208 S 1 be of order o \u2265 2. At a connected component Y of the fixed\n1\npoint manifold M S the tangent bundle T M splits equivariantly as the direct\nsum of T Y and the\nL normal bundle \u03bd. The latter splits (non-canonically) as\na direct sum \u03bd = k6=0 \u03bdk corresponding to the irreducible real 2-dimensional\n\u0001\nk\u03b8 sin k\u03b8\nS 1 -representations ei*\u03b8 7\u2192 \u2212cos\nsin k\u03b8 cos k\u03b8 , k 6= 0. We fix such a decomposition of\n\u03bd. For each k 6= 0 choose \u03b1k \u2208 {\u00b11} such that \u03b1k k \u2261 k\u0303 mod o, k\u0303 \u2208 {0, . . . , [ 2o ]}.\nOn each vector bundle \u03bdk introduce a complex structure such that \u03bb \u2208 S 1 acts\non \u03bdk by scalar multiplication with \u03bb\u03b1k k . Finally define\nX\nmo (Y ) := (\ndimC \u03bdk * k\u0303)/o and mo := min mo (Y ),\nY\n\nk\n\n1\n\nwhere Y runs over the connected components of M S .\nTheorem 3.4 ([12]). Let M be a Spin-manifold with S 1 -action. If mo > r\nthen the first (r + 1) coefficients of \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\n\u0004\nTo prove this result one analysis the expansion of the equivariant elliptic genus\nin the \u00c2-cusp using the Lefschetz fixed point formula [3] and Theorem 3.1 (see\n[12] for details). Since codim M \u03c3 \u2264 2o * mo Theorem 3.4 implies the following\ncorollary which generalizes Theorem 3.2 to cyclic actions of arbitrary finite\norder.\nCorollary 3.5. Let M be a Spin-manifold with S 1 -action and let \u03c3 \u2208 S 1 be of\norder o \u2265 2. If codim M \u03c3 > 2o * r then the first (r + 1) coefficients of \u03a60 (M )\nvanish.\n\u0004\n\n4\n\nPositive curvature and elliptic genera\n\nIn this section we prove the vanishing results for positively curved manifolds\nstated in the introduction. Recall from Section 2 that positive curvature restricts\nthe dimension of fixed point components of isometric actions. This property is\nan essential ingredient in the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2.\nDefinition 4.1. Let M be a closed connected manifold with smooth action by\na torus T . We say M has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime p if for\nall cyclic subgroups H \u2282 H \u2032 \u2282 T of order a power of p and every connected\ncomponent X \u2282 M H the dimension of two different connected components F1\n\u2032\nand F2 of X H is restricted by dim F1 + dim F2 < dim X.\n7\n\n\fBy Theorem 2.1 a positively curved manifold with isometric T -action has restricted fixed point dimension for any prime p. Other examples are given by\nT -manifolds with the same integral cohomology ring as a projective space (see\n[9], Chapter VII).\nA main step in the study of the elliptic genus for these manifolds is the\nfollowing lemma which is a consequence of Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.4 (see\nthe next section for the proof).\nLemma 4.2 (Main lemma). Let T be a torus of rank 2r > 0 and let M be\na Spin-manifold with effective T -action. If M has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime 2 and dim M > 12r \u2212 4 then at least one of the following\npossibilities holds:\n1. The first (r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\n2. For some subgroup S 1 \u2282 T with involution \u03c3 \u2208 S 1 the fixed point mani1\nfolds M \u03c3 and M S are orientable and connected of codimension 4 and 6,\nrespectively.\nWith this information at hand we now prove Theorem 1.1 stated in the introduction.\nTheorem 4.3. Let M be a closed connected Spin-manifold of dimension >\n12r\u22124. If M admits a metric of positive curvature and symmetry rank \u2265 2r then\nthe indices of twisted Dirac operators occurring as the first (r + 1) coefficients\nin the expansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\nProof: For r = 0 the theorem follows from [35]. So assume r > 0. Let T denote\na torus of rank 2r acting isometrically and effectively on M . Assume the first\n(r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) do not vanish. In particular, M is\nof even dimension and simply connected [52].\nThe T -action has the properties given in the second part of Lemma 4.2,\n1\ni.e. X := M \u03c3 and X S are orientable connected submanifolds of codimension\n4 and 6, respectively. Note that X, being a totally geodesic submanifold of\n1\nM, inherits positive curvature from M . Since the submanifold X S of X has\ncodimension two it follows from Theorem 2.4 that X is diffeomorphic to a sphere\nor a complex projective space. It is well-known that a non-trivial S 1 -action on\na complex projective space has more than one connected fixed point component\n(cf. [9], Chapter VII, Theorem 5.1). Thus X is diffeomorphic to a sphere of\ncodimension 4. Since dim M > 8 the Euler class e(\u03bdX ) \u2208 H 4 (X; Z) of the\nnormal bundle \u03bdX of X \u2282 M is trivial (we fix compatible orientations for X\nand \u03bdX ).\nThis implies that the expansion of the elliptic genus in the signature cusp\nvanishes as we will explain next (see [12] for details). Recall\nP that the coefficients\nof this expansion are twisted signatures sign(q, LM ) = l\u22650 sign(M, El ) * q l ,\nwhere El is a virtual complex vector bundle associated to the tangent bundle\nT M . The S 1 -action on T M induces an action on each El . Let signS 1 (M, El )\ndenote the S 1 -equivariant twisted signature and signS 1 (q, LM ) the equivariant\nexpansion of the elliptic genus. Recall from Theorem 3.1 that sign(q, LM ) =\nsignS 1 (q, LM )(\u03bb) for any \u03bb \u2208 S 1 . By the Lefschetz fixed point formula [3]\n\n8\n\n\fsignS 1 (M, El )(\u03c3) is equal to\n* \u0012\n+\n\u0013 Y\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nY\n1 + e\u2212yj\n1 + e\u2212xi\nyj *\nxi *\n*\n* ch(El )(\u03c3) * e(\u03bdX ), [X] .\n1 \u2212 e\u2212xi\n1 \u2212 e\u2212yj\nj\ni\nHere \u00b1xi (resp. \u00b1yj ) denote the formal roots of X (resp. the normal bundle\n\u03bdX ), ch(El ) denotes the equivariant Chern character of El , [X] the fundamental\ncycle and h , i the Kronecker pairing.\nSince e(\u03bdX ) is trivial signS 1 (M, El )(\u03c3) = 0 for every l \u2265 0. By Theorem\n3.1 sign(q, LM ) vanishes identically. Thus \u03a60 (M ) = 0 contradicting the initial\nassumption of the proof.\n\u0004\nRemarks 4.4.\n2.3.\n\n1. Theorem 4.3 also follows from Lemma 4.2 and Theorem\n\n2. The statement for r = 2 in Theorem 4.3 can be strengthened to: If\nM admits a metric of positive curvature and symmetry rank \u2265 3 then\nthe first three coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish, i.e. \u00c2(M ) =\n\u00c2(M, T M ) = \u00c2(M, \u039b2 (T M )) = 0.\nUnder stronger assumptions on the bounds for the symmetry rank and the\ndimension the conclusion of Theorem 4.3 holds if one only assumes that M has\npositive kth Ricci curvature and an elementary p-abelian subgroup of the torus\nacts by isometries.\nRecall that a manifold M has positive kth Ricci curvature (or k-positive\nRicci curvature) if for any (k + 1) mutually orthogonal unit tangent vectors\nPk\ne, e1 , . . . , ek (at any point of M ) the sum of curvatures i=1 sec(e\u2227ei ) is positive\n[33]. Thus, 1-positive Ricci curvature is equivalent to positive curvature and\n(dim M \u2212 1)-positive Ricci curvature is equivalent to positive Ricci curvature.\nAssume that M has positive kth Ricci curvature and assume that a torus T\nof rank R acts smoothly on M such that the induced action of the p-torus Tp \u223c\n=\n(Z/pZ)R , p a prime, is isometric and effective. To keep the exposition simple we\nshall assume the generous bounds R \u2265 p * r + k+1\n2 and dim M \u2265 6p * r + (k \u2212 1).\nProposition 4.5. For a connected Spin-manifold M as above the indices of\ntwisted Dirac operators occurring as the first (r + 1) coefficients in the expansion\n\u03a60 (M ) vanish.\nSketch of proof: First note that the intersection property for totally geodesic\nsubmanifolds in positive curvature (Theorem 2.1) extends to positive kth Ricci\ncurvature [33]: Two totally geodesic submanifolds N1 and N2 of a manifold M\nof positive kth Ricci curvature intersect if dim N1 + dim N2 \u2265 dim M + (k \u2212 1).\nIn particular, if F1 and F2 are two different connected fixed point components\nof an isometry \u03c3 then dim F1 + dim F2 < dim M + (k \u2212 1).\nAssume the first (r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) do not vanish.\nConsider the action of \u03c3 \u2208 Tp on M . By Corollary 3.5 the codimension of M \u03c3 is\n\u2264 2p*r. Hence, a connected component F of M \u03c3 has either \"small codimension\",\ni.e. codim F \u2264 2p * r, or \"small dimension\", i.e. dim F < 2p * r + (k \u2212 1).\nConsider a T -fixed point pt \u2208 M (which exists since \u03a6(M ) 6= 0) and let\nF\u03c3 \u2282 M \u03c3 denote the component which contains pt. It is an elementary exercise\n9\n\n\fto show that the p-torus Tp has a basis \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3R such that dim F\u03c3i \u2265 2R \u2212 2 \u2265\n2p * r + (k \u2212 1). This implies that the codimension of F\u03c3i is small. Since\ndim M \u2265 6p * r + (k \u2212 1) the codimension of F\u03c3+\u03c3\u2032 is small provided this holds\nfor F\u03c3 and F\u03c3\u2032 . Hence, the codimension of F\u03c3 is small for every \u03c3 \u2208 Tp , i.e.\ncodim F\u03c3 \u2264 2p * r for every \u03c3 \u2208 Tp . However, it follows from elementary linear\nalgebra that for some \u03c3 \u2208 Tp the codimension of F\u03c3 is at least 2R \u2265 2p*r+(k+1).\nThis gives the desired contradiction. Hence, the first (r + 1) coefficients in the\nexpansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\n\u0004\nThe next result implies Theorem 1.2 stated in the introduction.\nTheorem 4.6. Let M be a closed 2-connected manifold of dimension > 8 with\neffective smooth S 1 -action. Assume M admits a metric of positive curvature\nsuch that the subgroup Z/4Z \u2282 S 1 acts by isometries. Then \u00c2(M ) and \u00c2(M, T M )\nvanish.\nProof: We fix an orientation and a Spin-structure for M . Note that \u00c2(M )\nvanishes by [35, 4]. Let \u03c1 \u2208 S 1 be an element of order 4 and let \u03c3 := \u03c12 . Assume\n\u00c2(M, T M ) does not vanish. Then M has dimension 4k \u2265 12 and the fixed point\nmanifold M \u03c3 is the union of a connected component X of codimension 4 and\n(a possible empty set of) isolated fixed points by Corollary 2.2, Theorem 3.2\nand Corollary 3.3. Next apply Theorem 3.4 (for o = 4) to conclude that either\nX = X \u03c1 or the codimension of X \u03c1 in X is two.\nWe claim that X = X \u03c1 . If the codimension of X \u03c1 is two then the inclusion\n\u03c1\nX \u0592\u2192 X is (4k \u22127)-connected by Theorem 2.3. This implies that b4 (X) is equal\nto b2 (X) (use Poincar\u00e9 duality for X and X \u03c1 ). Note that X is 2-connected by\nTheorem 2.3. Hence, b4 (X) vanishes. In particular, the Euler class of the normal\nbundle of X in M vanishes rationally. Now argue as in the proof of Theorem\n4.3 to conclude that sign(q, LM ) = signS 1 (q, LM )(\u03c3) = 0 contradicting the\nassumption on \u00c2(M, T M ). Hence, X = X \u03c1 .\nSince X is fixed by \u03c1 the action of \u03c1 on the normal bundle \u03bdX induces\na complex structure such that \u03c1 acts by multiplication with i. We fix the\norientation of X which is compatible with the orientations of \u03bdX and M . Also\nthe action of \u03c1 induces a complex structure on the normal bundle of any of the\nisolated \u03c3-fixed points. We shall now compute the local contributions in the\nLefschetz fixed point formula for signS 1 (q, LM )(\u03c1):\nX\nsignS 1 (q, LM )(\u03c1) = \u03bcX +\n\u03bcpj\n\nHere \u03bcX (resp. \u03bcpj ) denotes the local contribution at X (resp. at an isolated\nfixed point pj ). The term \u03bcX is given by [3]\n\u03bcX = hTX * NX , [X]i\nwhere\nTX :=\nand\nNX :=\n\nY\n\nj=1,2\n\nY\ni\n\n\u221e\n1 + e\u2212xi Y (1 + q n * exi ) * (1 + q n * e\u2212xi )\n*\nxi *\n1 \u2212 e\u2212xi n=1 (1 \u2212 q n * exi ) * (1 \u2212 q n * e\u2212xi )\n\n!\n\n\u221e\n1 + e\u2212yj * (\u2212i) Y (1 + q n * eyj * i) * (1 + q n * e\u2212yj * (\u2212i))\n*\n1 \u2212 e\u2212yj * (\u2212i) n=1 (1 \u2212 q n * eyj * i) * (1 \u2212 q n * e\u2212yj * (\u2212i))\n\n10\n\n!\n\n\fHere \u00b1xi (resp. y1 , y2 ) denote the formal roots of X (resp. \u03bdX ). Since X is\n2-connected the first Chern class y1 + y2 of \u03bdX vanishes. This implies\nNX =\n\n1 + e\u2212y1 * (\u2212i) 1 + ey1 * (\u2212i)\n*\n= \u22121.\n1 \u2212 e\u2212y1 * (\u2212i) 1 \u2212 ey1 * (\u2212i)\n\nHence, the expression for \u03bcX simplifies to\n\u03bcX = \u2212 hTX , [X]i = \u2212sign(q, LX).\nThe term \u03bcpj is given by [3]\n\u03bcpj = \u00b1\n\n\u221e\n1 \u2212 i Y (1 + i * q n ) * (1 \u2212 i * q n )\n1 + i n=1 (1 \u2212 i * q n ) * (1 + i * q n )\n\n!2k\n\n=\u00b1\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212i\n1+i\n\n\u00132k\n\n= \u00b11\n\nBy Theorem 3.1 sign(q, LM ) = signS 1 (q, LM )(\u03c1) = \u2212sign(q, LX) + c, where c\nis the integer obtained by summing up \u03bcpj . Equivalently,\n\u03a6(M ) = \u2212\u03a6(X) + c\n\n(2)\n\nNote that \u03a60 (M ) \u2208 q \u2212k/2 C[[q]], whereas \u03a60 (X) \u2208 q 1/2 *q \u2212k/2 C[[q]]. By comparing the expansions in the \u00c2-cusp of both sides of (2) it follows that \u03a60 (M ) \u2208 Z\n(in fact, depending on the parity of k, \u03a60 (M ) is equal to 0 or c). Since dim M > 8\nthis implies that \u00c2(M, T M ) = 0.\n\u0004\nIn the remaining part of this section we use Lemma 4.2 to study the Pontrjagin numbers of 4k-dimensional Spin-manifolds with symmetry which have the\nsame integral cohomology ring as a projective space. Such manifolds are either\nintegral cohomology HP k 's or integral cohomology Cayley planes (for recent\nprogress in the study of integral cohomology CP m 's with symmetry we refer to\n[11] and references therein). Note that an integral cohomology Cayley plane with\nsmooth non-trivial S 1 -action has the same Pontrjagin numbers as the Cayley\nplane since these are completely determined by the signature and the \u00c2-genus\n(the latter vanishes by [4]). The same argument applies to an integral cohomology HP 2 with smooth non-trivial S 1 -action. We shall now apply Lemma 4.2 to\nintegral cohomology HP k 's for k > 2.\nProposition 4.7. Let M be an integral cohomology HP k , i.e. H \u2217 (M ; Z) \u223c\n=\nZ[x]/(xk+1 ), where x has degree 4. If a torus T of rank 2r > 0 acts effectively\nand smoothly on M and 4k > 12r \u2212 4 then the first (r + 1) coefficients in the\nexpansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\nProof: Note that M is a Spin-manifold with restricted fixed point dimension\nfor any prime. By Lemma 4.2 we may assume that for some S 1 -subgroup of T\n1\nthe fixed point manifold M S is connected of codimension 6. It is well known\n1\nS1\nthat M is an integral cohomology projective space of the form H \u2217 (M S ; Z) \u223c\n=\nl+1\nZ[y]/(y ) where y has even degree \u2264 4 (cf. [9], Chapter VII, Theorem 5.1).\n1\nAlso \u03c7(M ) = \u03c7(M S ) by the Lefschetz fixed point formula for the Euler char1\nacteristic. Since the codimension of M S is equal to 6 it follows that deg(y) = 2\nand k = l = 3. Hence, M is an integral cohomology HP 3 . For a 12-dimensional\n11\n\n\fmanifold the elliptic genus is a linear combination of the signature and the\n\u00c2-genus. The signature of M vanishes for trivial reasons. The \u00c2-genus of\nM vanishes since M is a Spin-manifold with non-trivial S 1 -action [4]. Hence,\n\u03a6(M ) = 0. This completes the proof.\n\u0004\nFinally we point out the following consequence of Lemma 4.2.\nProposition 4.8. Let T be a torus of rank 2r > 0 and let M be a Spin-manifold\nwith T -action of dimension > 12r \u2212 4. Assume the signature of M does not\nvanish. If M has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime 2 then the first\n(r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) vanish.\n1\n\nProof: By the rigidity of the signature sign(M ) = sign(M S ) for any S 1 1\naction. Since the signature of M does not vanish dim M \u2261 dim M S \u2261 0 mod 4\n1\n1\nif M S is connected. In particular, codim M S 6= 6 and the statement follows\nfrom Lemma 4.2.\n\u0004\n\n5\n\nProof of the main Lemma\n\nIn this section we prove Lemma 4.2. Let T be a torus of rank 2r > 0 and let\nM be a Spin-manifold with effective T -action. Assume M has restricted fixed\npoint dimension for the prime 2 and dim M > 12r \u2212 4. Assume also that the\nfirst (r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) do not vanish. This implies\nthat dim M = 4k \u2265 12r.\nOur goal is to show that for some subgroup S 1 \u2282 T with involution \u03c3 \u2208\n1\n1\nS the fixed point manifolds M \u03c3 and M S are orientable and connected of\ncodimension 4 and 6, respectively. To this end we first examine the action of T\nat a fixed point pt (which exists since \u03a6(M ) 6= 0).\nThe tangent space Tpt M of M at pt decomposes (non-canonically) into 2k\ncomplex one-dimensional T -representations Tpt M = R1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 R2k . With respect to such a decomposition the action of T on Tpt M is given by a homomorphism T \u0592\u2192 U (1)2k . We denote by h the induced homomorphism of integral\nlattices IT \u2192 IU(1)2k = Z2k . Since the T -action is effective the mod p reduction\nIT \u2297 (Z/pZ) \u2192 (Z/pZ)2k of h is injective for every p \u2265 2.\nFor a finite covering homomorphism T\u0302 := S 1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 T we denote by \u0125\nthe homomorphism of integral lattices IT\u0302 = Z2r \u2192 Z2k for the covering action\non Tpt M . Note that an element \u0125(a), a \u2208 IT\u0302 , determines a homomorphism\n\u03b9\nS 1 \u2192 T\u0302 , exp(\u03b8) 7\u2192 exp(\u03b8 * a), and an S 1 -subgroup \u03b9(S 1 ) \u2282 T\u0302 . Let c1 , . . . , c2r\nbe the image of the standard basis of IT\u0302 = Z2r under \u0125.\nClaim 5.1. Let p be a prime. There exists a finite covering homomorphism\nT\u0302 := S 1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 T of degree coprime to p such that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n? 0 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n\u2217 0 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n!\nc1\n0 ? 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n0 \u2217 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n\uf8ec 0 0 ? 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ? \uf8f7 \uf8ec 0 0 \u2217 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ? \uf8f7\n..\nA :=\n= \uf8ed . . . . . . . . . . . \uf8f8 \u2261 \uf8ed . . . . . . . . . . . \uf8f8 mod p\n.\n.. .. .. .. . . .. .. .. .. .. ..\n.. .. .. .. . . .. .. .. .. .. ..\nc2r\n0 0 0 0 ... ? ? ? ? ... ?\n\nwhere each \u2217 is coprime to p.\n\n12\n\n0 0 0 0 ... \u2217 ? ? ? ... ?\n\n\fThe claim is an elementary fact from linear algebra. For convenience we give\na proof at the end of the section. In the following let p = 2 and let T\u0302 =\nS 1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 T denote a finite covering action of odd degree with the\nproperties described in Claim 5.1.\nThe next claim gives information on the action of involutions of T\u0302 on Tpt M\n(again the proof is postponed to the end of the section). This information will\nbe used to exhibit involutions for which the fixed point manifold is connected\nof codimension 4 (since T\u0302 \u2192 T has odd degree the same property holds for\ninvolutions of T ).\nClaim 5.2.\n1. For the involution \u03c3i \u2208 T\u0302 corresponding to ci (\u03c3i acts on\nTpt M by exp(ci /2) \u2208 U (1)2k ) the component of M \u03c3i which contains the\nT\u0302 -fixed point pt has codimension 4, i.e. ci has two odd entries.\nP\n2. The involution i \u03c3i acts trivially on each representation space Ri , i > 2r,\ni.e. each of the last (2k \u2212 2r) columns of A has an even number of odd\nentries.\n3. The 2-torus of T\u0302 (i.e. the subgroup generated by the involutions \u03c3i ) acts\nnon-trivially on at most r of the representation spaces R2r+1 , . . . , R2k , i.e.\nat most r of the last (2k \u2212 2r) columns of A are non-zero modulo 2.\nHence, for every involution \u03c3 \u2208 T\u0302 and every T\u0302 -fixed point the connected component of M \u03c3 which contains the fixed point has codimension \u2264 6r \u2264 12 dim M .\nSince M has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime 2 it follows that M \u03c3\nis the union of a connected component of codimension \u2264 6r with T\u0302 -fixed point\n(in fact the codimension is \u2264 4r by Theorem 3.2) and (a possible empty set of)\ncomponents with fixed point free T -action. Recall that codim M \u03c3i = 4. Since\nany isolated \u03c3-fixed point is also fixed by T\u0302 it follows that M \u03c3i is connected of\ncodimension 4 for every i.\nLet Sj denote the jth S 1 -factor of T\u0302 . Below we shall use Theorem 3.4 to\nshow\nClaim 5.3. The fixed point manifold M Sj is connected of codimension 4. In\nparticular, cj has two odd entries and all other entries vanish.\nNote that Claim 5.1, Claim 5.2 and Claim 5.3 imply that the codimension of\nany connected component of M T\u0302 is \u2264 6r.\nWith this information at hand we shall now complete the proof of Lemma\n4.2. By the second part of Claim 5.2 one can choose cj such that\n\u0001\n... 0 odd 0 ... 0 0 0 ... 0 odd 0 ... 0\n( cc2rj ) = 00 ...\n0 0 0 ... 0 odd 0 ... 0 odd 0 ... 0\n\nConsider the S 1 -subgroup S \u2282 T\u0302 determined by 2 * cj + c2r \u2208 \u0125(IT\u0302 ). The fixed\npoint manifold M \u03c3 of the involution \u03c3 \u2208 S is equal to M \u03c32r which is connected\nof codimension 4. The S-fixed point manifold has codimension 2 in M \u03c3 . Since\nM \u03c3 has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime 2 the fixed point manifold\nM S is connected. Also, M S is orientable. Since M is a Spin-manifold M \u03c3 is\norientable as well (see for example [8], Lemma 10.1). Finally note that the same\nproperties hold for the S 1 -subgroup of T which is the image of S under the\ncovering homomorphism T\u0302 \u2192 T .\n\u0004\n13\n\n\fProof of Claim 5.1: It is an elementary fact from linear algebra that h(IT ) \u2282\nZ2k admits a basis b1 , . . . , b2r such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\u2217 0 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n? ? ? ? ... ? ? ? ? ... ?\n!\nb1\n0 \u2217 0 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ?\n0 ? ? ? ... ? ? ? ? ... ?\n\uf8ec 0 0 ? ? ... ? ? ? ? ... ? \uf8f7 \uf8ec 0 0 \u2217 0 ... 0 ? ? ? ... ? \uf8f7\n..\n= \uf8ed . . . . . . . . . . . \uf8f8 \u2261 \uf8ed . . . . . . . . . . . \uf8f8 mod p\n.\n.. .. .. .. . . .. .. .. .. .. ..\n.. .. .. .. . . .. .. .. .. .. ..\nb2r\n0 0 0 0 ... \u2217 ? ? ? ... ?\n\n0 0 0 0 ... ? ? ? ? ... ?\n\nafter permuting columns (i.e. after permuting the representation spaces Ri )\nif necessary. Here each \u2217 is coprime to p. Note that the choice of a basis\nof h(IT ) is equivalent to the choice of an isomorphism S 1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 T .\nUsing suitable row operations of the form bi\n\u03b1 * bi + \u03b2 * bj , where i < j,\n\u03b1 6\u2261 0 mod p and \u03b2 \u2261 0 mod p, one obtains a basis c1 , . . . , c2r of h(IT ) \u2297 Q\nsuch that the matrix A = (c1 , . . . , c2r )t has the properties given in the claim.\nEach cj determines a homomorphism \u03b9j : S 1 \u2192 T . Since c1 , . . . , c2r is a basis of\n\u03b9 *...*\u03b9\nh(IT ) \u2297 Q the homomorphism T\u0302 := S 1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S 1 1\u2212\u21922r T is a finite covering\nhomomorphism. The induced homomorphism \u0125 : IT\u0302 \u2192 Z2k of integral lattices\nmaps the standard basis to c1 , . . . , c2r . In view of the properties of the matrix\nA the covering homomorphism has degree coprime to p.\n\u0004\nProof of Claim 5.2: First note that by Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.3 for\nevery involution \u03c3 \u2208 T\u0302 the fixed point manifold M \u03c3 has codimension \u2264 4r and\nthe dimension of each connected component of M \u03c3 is divisible by 4. Since the\ndimension of M is \u2265 8r and M has restricted fixed point dimension for the prime\n2 it follows that for every connected component F of M \u03c3 either codim F \u2264 4r\nor dim F \u2264 4r \u2212 4.\nLet \u01251 : IT\u0302 \u2297 (Z/2Z) \u2192 (Z/2Z)2k denote the mod 2 reduction of \u0125. For the\nbinary linear code C1 := im(\u01251 ) \u2282 (Z/2Z)2k we conclude that each code word\n\u03c3 \u2208 C1 has either weight3 wt(\u03c3) \u2264 2r or co-weight cowt(\u03c3) := 2k \u2212 wt(\u03c3) \u2264\n2r \u2212 2. In particular, the mod 2 reduction of ci , denoted by \u03c3i , has weight\nwt(\u03c3i ) \u2264 2r. Since the weight function is sublinear, i.e. wt(\u03c3 + \u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2264 wt(\u03c3) +\nwt(\u03c3 \u2032 ), and 2k \u2265 6r it follows that the subset of code words with weight \u2264 2r\nis closed under addition.\n\u2264 2r for every \u03c3 \u2208 C1 . In particular, this\nP\nP Hence wt(\u03c3)\ninequality holds for j \u03c3j and j6=i \u03c3j which implies wt(\u03c3i ) = 2 (i.e. ci has\ntwo odd entries) and implies that each of the last (2k \u2212 2r) columns of A has an\neven number of odd entries. Finally note that if l of the last (2k \u2212 2r) columns\nof A are non-zero modulo 2 then the weight of some code word is \u2265 2l. Hence\nl \u2264 r. This completes the proof of the claim.\n\u0004\nProof of Claim 5.3: To show that M Sj is connected of codimension 4 it\nsuffices to prove this property for all cyclic subgroups Cs \u2282 Sj of order 2s ,\ns \u2208 N. We know already that M C1 is connected of codimension 4.\nAssume M Cs is connected of codimension 4. To show the corresponding\nproperty for Cs+1 we will use the following consequence of Theorem 3.4 which\nwe prove first:\nLet M be a connected Spin-manifold with S 1 -action. Assume the cyclic subgroup\nCs \u2282 S 1 of order 2s acts non-trivially on M and the fixed point manifold M Cs is\n3 The\n\nweight of \u03c3 is defined as the number of entries equal to 1.\n\n14\n\n\fconnected. If the first (r + 1) coefficients in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) do not vanish\nthen the codimension of the submanifold M Cs+1 of M Cs is \u2264 4r \u2212 2.\nLet o := 2s+1 . Note that for some connected component Y of the S 1 -fixed\npoint manifold mo (Y ) \u2264 r by Theorem 3.4. Let Z \u2282 M Cs+1 be the connected component which contains Y . Note that mo (Y ) is strictly larger than\ncodim (Z \u2282 M Cs )/4 since M Cs is a proper connected submanifold of M . Hence\nthe codimension of Z in M Cs must be less than 4r which implies that the codimension of the submanifold M Cs+1 of M Cs is \u2264 4r \u2212 2.\nWe shall now continue with the study of the action of Sj . By the statement\nabove the codimension of the submanifold M Cs+1 of M Cs is \u2264 4r \u2212 2. Since M\nhas restricted fixed point dimension for the prime 2 a connected component of\nM Cs+1 has either codimension \u2264 4r \u2212 2 in M Cs or has dimension \u2264 4r \u2212 4.\n1\ne\nNext consider\nP the action of the S -subgroup S of T\u0302 which is determined by\ns\nes \u2282 Se denote the cyclic subgroup of order 2s .\nc := cj + 2 * i ci \u2208 \u0125(IT\u0302 ). Let C\ne\ne\ne\nBy the statement above the codimension of the submanifold M Cs+1 of M Cs is\n\u2264 4r \u2212 2.\nIt follows that either the number of entries of cj which are \u2261 2s mod 2s+1\nis \u2264 2r \u2212 1 or the number of entries of cj which are \u2261 0 mod 2s+1 is \u2264 2r \u2212 2.\nThe same property holds for e\nc. Also the mod 2s+1 -reductions of c and e\nc have\nthe same last (2k \u2212 2r) entries by the second part of Claim 5.2.\nThis implies that the mod 2s+1 -reduction of cj has only two non-zero entries.\nIn other words Cs+1 \u2282 Sj acts trivially on the tangent bundle of M Cs at the\nT -fixed point pt. Thus M Cs+1 = M Cs and M Cs+1 is connected of codimension\n4. This completes the induction step. It follows that the fixed point manifold\nM Sj is connected of codimension 4.\n\u0004\n\n6\n\nRicci versus sectional curvature\n\nApparently the only known topological property which allows to distinguish\npositive Ricci curvature from positive curvature on simply connected manifolds\nis based on Gromov's Betti number theorem [19]: With respect to any field\nof coefficients the sum of Betti numbers of a positively curved n-dimensional\nmanifold is less than a constant C(n) depending only on the dimension.\nThe bound in [19] which depends doubly exponentially on the dimension n\nhas been improved by Abresch [1] who showed that the Betti number theorem\nholds for a bound C(n) depending exponentially on n3 (the bound C(n) may\nbe chosen to satisfy exp(5n3 + 8n2 + 4n + 2) \u2264 C(n) \u2264 exp(6n3 + 9n2 + 4n + 4)).\nSha and Yang [49] constructed metrics of positive Ricci curvature on the kfold connected sum of S n \u00d7 S m , n, m > 1, for every k \u2208 N. By the Betti\nnumber theorem these manifolds do not admit positively curved metrics if k is\nsufficiently large.\nIn this section we present two methods to exhibit manifolds with \"small\"\nBetti numbers (i.e. the sum is less than C(n)) which admit metrics of positive\nRicci curvature but do not admit metrics of positive curvature under assumptions on the symmetry. The first method which relies on Theorem 1.1 leads\nto\n15\n\n\fTheorem 6.1. For every r \u2265 3 and every d \u2208 N there exists a simply connected\nclosed manifold M of dimension greater than d such that:\n1. M admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature with symmetry rank \u2265 2r.\n2. M does not admit a metric of positive curvature with symmetry rank \u2265 2r.\nThe manifold M may be chosen to have small Betti numbers. The second\nmethod which relies on Theorem 3.4 and recent work of Wilking (see Theorem\n2.3) gives stronger information. Recall from the introduction that an S 1 -action\nis called finite-order-isometric of order o if the cyclic subgroup of order o acts\neffectively and isometrically.\nTheorem 6.2. For every d \u2208 N and every o \u2265 2 there exists a simply connected\nclosed manifold M of dimension greater than d such that:\n1. M admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature with finite-order-isometric\nS 1 -action of order o.\n2. M does not admit a metric of positive curvature with finite-order-isometric\nS 1 -action of order o.\nAgain the manifold M may be chosen to have small Betti numbers. The examples occurring in both theorems are given by Riemannian products of the\nform M1 \u00d7 M2 . The first factor M1 is a Spin-manifold of positive Ricci curvature with large symmetry rank and non-vanishing elliptic genus (below we\nshall choose M1 to be a product of quaternionic projective planes). The second\nfactor M2 is a Spin-manifold of positive Ricci curvature for which the index\n\u00c2(M2 , T M2 ) does not vanish. The next proposition shows that these properties\nhold for a hypersurface in CP n+1 of degree n = 2m > 2.\nProposition 6.3. A non-singular hypersurface Vn in CP n+1 of degree n =\n2m > 2 has the following properties:\n1. Vn is Spin and admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature.\n2. The Betti numbers of Vn are small.\n3. The index \u00c2(Vn , T Vn ) does not vanish.\nProof: For a proof of some of the properties of hypersurfaces used below we\nrefer to [27] and references therein. Let V l denote a non-singular hypersurface\nin CP n+1 of degree l. The tangent bundle of V l is stably the restriction of\n(T CP n+1 \u2212\u03b3 l ) to V l , where \u03b3 denotes the complex line bundle over CP n+1 with\nfirst Chern class h \u2208 H 2 (CP n+1 ; Z) dual to CP n \u0592\u2192 CP n+1 (in the following\nwe shall denote the restriction of h to V l also by h). Note that hhn , [V l ]i = l.\nThe total Chern class of V l is given by\nc(V l ) = (1 + h)n+2 * (1 + l * h)\u22121 .\nIn particular, c1 (V l ) = (n + 2 \u2212 l) * h. Taking l = n we conclude that Vn is\na Spin-manifold with positive first Chern class. By Yau's solution [59] of the\nCalabi conjecture Vn admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature.\n16\n\n\fThe Euler characteristic of Vn is equal to the Chern number hcn (Vn ), [Vn ]i\nwhich can be computed via the formula for c(M ) given above. In turns out that\n\u03c7(Vn ) =\n\n(n \u2212 1)n+2 \u2212 1\n+ (n + 2).\nn\n\nBy the Lefschetz theorem on hyperplane sections the odd Betti numbers of Vn\nvanish for any field of coefficients (cf. [27], \u00a722). Hence the Betti numbers of\nVn are small.\nFinally we compute \u00c2(Vn , T Vn ). By the cohomological version of the index\ntheorem [3] \u00c2(V l , T V l ) is equal to hB, [V l ]i, where\nB :=\n\n\u0012\n\nh\neh/2 \u2212 e\u2212h/2\n\n\u0013n+2\n\n*\n\n\u0001\nelh/2 \u2212 e\u2212lh/2\n* (n + 2)eh \u2212 elh .\nlh\n\nIt follows that hB, [V l ]i is the residue of l*B/hn+1 at h = 0. Changing variables,\nw := eh \u2212 1, one computes that \u00c2(V l , T V l ) is equal to the coefficient of wn+1\nin\n(1 + w)(n\u2212l)/2 * ((1 + w)l \u2212 1) * ((n + 2) * (1 + w) \u2212 (1 + w)l ).\n\u0001\n2n\nHence, \u00c2(Vn , T Vn ) = n + 2 \u2212 n+1\nwhich does not vanish for n = 2m > 2. This\ncompletes the proof of the proposition.\n\u0004\nProof of Theorem 6.1: Let M1 be the Riemannian product of (r \u2212 1)-copies\nof HP 2 , let M2 be a non-singular hypersurface in CP n+1 of degree n = 2m \u226b 0\n(equipped with a metric of positive Ricci curvature) and let M be the Riemannian product M1 \u00d7 M2 . Since the symmetry rank of HP 2 is three and r \u2265 3 the\nsymmetry rank of the positively Ricci curved Spin-manifold M is \u2265 2r.\nBy Proposition 6.3 \u00c2(M2 , T M2 ) 6= 0. Thus the expansion \u03a60 (M2 ) has a pole\nof order (dim M2 )/8 \u2212 1 = (dim M )/8 \u2212 r. For a homogeneous Spin-manifold\nthe elliptic genus is equal to the signature [30]. In particular, \u03a6(HP 2 ) = 1 which\ncan also be shown by a direct computation. This gives\n\u03a6(M ) = \u03a6(HP 2 )r\u22121 * \u03a6(M2 ) = \u03a6(M2 ).\nIt follows that \u03a60 (M ) has a pole of order (dim M )/8 \u2212 r. Thus, the first (r + 1)\ncoefficient in the expansion \u03a60 (M ) do not vanish. By Theorem 1.1 the manifold\nM does not admit a metric of positive curvature with symmetry rank \u2265 2r. \u0004\nProof of Theorem 6.2: Let M be the Riemannian product of HP 2 and Vn\n(the latter shall be equipped with a metric of positive Ricci curvature). Since\nthe positively Ricci curved manifold M has symmetry rank \u2265 3 it admits a\nfinite-order-isometric S 1 -action of any order.\nNow assume M carries a metric of positive curvature with finite-orderisometric S 1 -action of order o. We shall derive a contradiction for n = 2m \u226b o.\nLet \u03c3 \u2208 S 1 be of order o. Since \u03a60 (M ) has a pole of order (dim M )/8 \u2212 2 the\ncodimension of M \u03c3 is bounded from above by a constant which depends on o\nbut does not depend on dim M = 2n + 8 (see Corollary 3.5).\nLet N \u2282 M \u03c3 be a fixed point component of minimal codimension k. By\nTheorem 2.3 the inclusion N \u0592\u2192 M is ((2n + 8) \u2212 (k + l))-connected, where\n17\n\n\fl = k \u2212 1. Using Poincar\u00e9 duality for M and N it follows that H i (M ; Z) and\nH i+k (M ; Z) are isomorphic in the range l < i < (2n + 8) \u2212 (k + l). Hence, for\nn \u226b o the cohomology groups H n\u2212k (M ; Z) and H n (M ; Z) are isomorphic.\nRecall from [27], \u00a722, that the even Betti numbers b2i (Vn ) are one except\nfor 2i = n and the odd Betti numbers vanish. This implies bn\u2212k (M ) \u2264 3.\nHowever bn (M ) is > 3 (compare with the formula for \u03c7(Vn ) in the proof of the\nproposition above). This gives the desired contradiction.\n\u0004\nAcknowledgements: I like to thank Wilderich Tuschmann, Burkhard Wilking\nand Wolfgang Ziller for many stimulating discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] U.
