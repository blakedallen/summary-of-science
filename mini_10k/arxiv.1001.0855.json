The\nFeAs layer is considered as the key structure for superconductivity in systems ranging from SmO1\u2212x Fx FeAs,\nBa1\u2212x Kx Fe2 As2 [4, 5], to LiFeAs [6, 7]. Recently, certain\niron-chalcogenides, eg. Fe1+x Se, Fe1+y Te1\u2212x Sex [8, 9],\nhave been found to be superconducting as well. Fe1+x Se\nshows superconductivity at 8 K under ambient pressure [8] and 37 K under a 7 GPa hydrostatic pressure\n[10], which is comparable to Ba1\u2212x Kx Fe2 As2 (Tc =38 K)\n[5]. Because iron-chalcogenides do not involve arsenic, it\nwould be particularly important for applications. Furthermore, although Fe 3d orbitals play a vital role in the\niron-based high temperature superconductors, the anions\nseem also play an important role on various aspects, noting LaOFeP possesses a Tc of merely 5 K. Besides the\nsize effect, the polarizability of the anions has even been\nsuggested to be crucial for the superconductivity [11].\nTherefore, iron-chalcogenides provide an opportunity to\nstudy the role of anions in iron-based superconductors.\nThe iron-pnictides and iron-chalcogenides have many\nthings in common. The FeSe(Te) layer in Fe1+y Te1\u2212x Sex\nis isostructural to the FeAs or FeP layer in iron-pnictides.\nMoreover, the phase diagram of Fe1+y Te1\u2212x Sex resem-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: dlfeng@fudan.edu.cn\n\nFigure 1: (color online) (a) Real and imaginary parts of the\nmagnetic susceptibility of Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) single crystal at\n10 Gauss.

The undoped Fe1+y Te exhibits a\nspin density wave (SDW) ground state. With sufficient\nselenium doping, the SDW is suppressed, and the superconductivity occurs at a Tc as high as 15 K [9].\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 2: (color online) (a) Photoemission intensity distribution integrated over [EF \u2212 5 meV, EF + 5 meV ] window for\nFe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ).

Data were taken with circularly\npolarized 22 eV photons at HSRC.\n\nThere are also critical differences between the ironpnictides and iron-chalcogenides, in particular, between\ntheir structures of magnetic ordering.\nA common\ncollinear commensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering has been identified in all iron-pnictides. However,\nthe magnetic state of the Fe1+y Te1\u2212x Sex family has a\nbi-collinear commensurate or incommensurate antiferromagnetic ordering depending on the concentration of the\ninterstitial iron [12, 13]. It is still in a heated debate\nabout the origin of magnetic ordering in iron-based superconductors. While models based on local moments\nhave been suggested to understand both magnetic orderings [14\u201319], the collinear AFM in the iron-pnictides in\nprinciple can originate from nesting mechanism between\nthe hole pockets at \u0393 and the electron pockets at M\n[20], but the bi-collinear magnetic structure is inconsistent with this picture since there is no Fermi surface at\nX. Is there a connection between the electronic structure and magnetic ordering in the iron-chalcogenides? If\nthere is, what is the connection? The answers of these\nfundamental questions require a deep understanding of\nthe electronic structures of iron-chalcogenides. However,\nthere is just few data reported on the electronic structure\nof iron-chalcogenides [21].\nIn this Article, we investigate the electronic structure\nof Fe1.04 Te0.66 Se0.34 with high resolution angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and band calculation. The measured Fermi surfaces and the band structure are identified and found to qualitatively agree with\n\nthe density function theory (DFT) calculations. The\norbital characters of individual bands are studied by\npolarization-dependence studies and found to agree with\nthe calculation as well. No obvious effect of the fluctuating SDW is observed on the electronic structure. Furthermore, we found that although most aspects of the\nelectronic structure of this iron-chalcogenide are similar\nto the iron-pnictides, there are clearly three separated\nbands at the zone center for the iron-chalcogenides, while\nthere appear just two separated features for the normal\nstate of iron-pnictides. Moreover, the symmetry properties of the iron-chalcogenide bands near the zone center are different from those of the iron-pnictides. The\ndifference and similarity between the iron-pnictides and\niron-chalcogenides in their electronic structure may shed\nlight on our understanding of the role of anions and the\nsuperconductivity in iron-based superconductors.\n\nII.\n\nMATERIAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nFe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) single crystal was synthesized with\nthe NaCl/KCl-flux method. Fe powder, Te powder\nand Se powder were weighed according to the ratio of\nFe:Te:Se=1:0.7:0.3 (mole), and pressed into thin plates.\nThen FeTe(Se) polycrystal was acquired by reacting\nthe plate in an evacuated quartz tube at 1173 K for\n24 hours. FeTe(Se) polycrystal and the NaCl/KClflux were weighed according to the ratio of FeTe(Se):\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3: (color online) (a, b, c) Photoemission data taken\nwith 22 eV circularly polarized photons at HSRC along three\nmomentum cuts as indicated in the Brillouin zone sketch.

(g, h, i) Momentum distribution\ncurves near EF for data in panels a, b, c respectively.\n\nNaCl/KCl=1:10 (mass). They were thoroughly grounded\ninto a mixture, and loaded into an evacuated quartz tube.\nThe tube was kept at 1223 K for 24 hours and then slowly\ncooled to 873 K in 100 hours. Finally the quartz tube\nwas cooled in the furnace after shutting off the power.\nFe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) single crystal was obtained after dissolving the flux in deionized water. The element compositions of this single crystal were determined through\nenergy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis with dense sampling spots across a 0.4\u00d70.4 mm2 surface area. The\nEDX result shows that the sample is homogeneous, and\nthe maximal deviation of its compsitions is within 1.8%.\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 1) does not show any signs of SDW or structural transition. The resistivity data indicate that crystal\nreaches the zero resistance at about 9 K. However, the\nsusceptibility measurements show that although regions\nof the sample become superconducting at 9 K, it reaches\na bulk superconducting state at 2 K, with a transition\nwidth less than 3 K (10%-90%). This indicates that the\nbulk of the single crystal is quite homogeneous. With\n1 T magnetic field, superconductivity is suppressed, and\nthere is no sign of field-induced meta-magnetic transition.\nThe photoemission data have been taken with Scienta\nR4000 electron analyzers at Beamline 9 of Hiroshima synchrotron radiation center (HSRC) and the Surface and\nInterface Spectroscopy (SIS) Beamline of Swiss Light\nSource (SLS). The typical angular resolution is 0.3 de-\n\nFigure 4: (color online) (a, b, c) Photoemission data taken\nwith 22 eV light at HSRC, and 50 eV, and 100 eV circularly\npolarized light at SLS respectively.

The\nsample was cleaved in situ, and measured under ultrahigh-vacuum better than 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 torr. The sample aging effects are carefully monitored to ensure they do not\ncause artifacts in our analyses and conclusions. The SIS\nbeamline is equipped with an elliptically polarized undulator (EPU), which could switch the photon polarization\nbetween horizontal, vertical, or circular mode. This facilitates the polarization dependence studies, which is useful in determining the orbital characters of the bands [22].\n\nIII.\n\nBAND STRUCTURE AND FERMI\nSURFACE\n\nThe photoemission intensities distribution of\nFe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) at the Fermi energy is shown\nin Fig. 2(a). The data were taken at 15 K with 22 eV\nphotons. Similar to the iron-pnictides, the spectral\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 5: (color online) The calculated electronic band structure of FeTe0.66 Se0.34 along high-symmetry lines in the irreducible Brillouin zone.\n\nweight is mostly located around \u0393 and M. In order to\nresolve the details of the Fermi crossings, Fig. 2(c) shows\nthe photoemission intensity along the cut #1 in the\n\u0393\u2212M direction, several bands could be resolved. For a\nbetter visualization of the bands, Fig. 2(d) shows the\nsecond derivative with respect to energy for the data in\nFig. 2(c). Three bands, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, could be clearly\nidentified. The top of the \u03b1 band is very close to the\nFermi energy, but it is hard to judge whether it crosses\nEF based on the energy distribution curves (EDC's) in\nFig. 2(f). By judging from the momentum distribution\ncurves (MDC's) in Fig. 2(g) near \u0393, one finds that it\ncrosses the Fermi level with a very small-sized Fermi\nsurface. In order to check whether the spectral weight\naround M represents band crossings, the data in Fig. 2(c)\nis renormalized by its angular integrated spectrum and\nshown in Fig. 2(e). In this way, another band, \u03b4, is\nresolved. The MDC's in the boxed region are shown\nin Fig. 2(h), where one observes an electron-pocket\ntype of dispersion. This is similar to the BaFe2 As2\n[23], the \u03b4 band is quite weak in such an experimental\ngeometry due to the strong orbital-dependence of the\nmatrix element [22]. Similarly, Figs. 2(i) and (j) show\nthe photoemission intensity and its second derivative\nplot along the \u0393-X direction, where \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands\nare observed. Therefore, there are totally three bands\nnear the \u0393-point, and they all cross the Fermi surface\nand form three hole pockets. Based on the identified\nband dispersions, the Fermi crossings are determined\nand shown in Fig. 2(b). We note because of symmetry\nconstraints, only crossings for one elliptical Fermi surface\ncould be observed around M or M' [22]. The experimental Fermi surfaces are determined by fitting the Fermi\ncrossings with symmetry in consideration. Assuming\nthe \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 Fermi surfaces to be cylindrical, one\ncould estimate the electron concentration based on the\n\nFigure 6: (color online) The calculated Fermi surface of\nFeTe0.66 Se0.34 .\n\nLuttinger theorem. We obtained 0.08 holes per unit\ncell. This is not inconsistent with the chemical formula,\nconsidering variations of the Fermi surface volume\ncaused by kz dispersion of the band structure.\nTo further illustrate the behavior of the \u03b1 band, Fig. 3\nshows three nearby cuts taken with 22 eV photons. When\napproaching (kx = 0, ky = 0), the \u03b1 band disperses\nrather rapidly with its top in each cut moving towards\nEF . Based on the peak positions in the MDC's [Fig. 3(j)],\none could observe a Fermi crossing of the \u03b1 band very\nclose to (kx = 0, ky = 0), giving a small hole-like Fermi\nsurface. However, this Fermi crossing is not observed at\nseveral other photon energies such as 50 eV and 100 eV\n(Fig. 4). Since these momentum cuts sample through\n(kx , ky ) = (0, 0) at different kz , the \u03b1 Fermi surface is\nthus a closed pocket. Moreover, in Figs. 4(j-l), the EDC's\nhave been divided by the temperature-broadened FermiDirac distribution, where both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands appear\nto be degenerate within the experimental resolution at\n22 eV. Based on the calculations below, it suggests that\nthis data cut should be very close to the zone center, \u0393.\n\nIV.\n\nELECTRONIC BAND STRUCTURE\nCALCULATION\n\nTo understand the data, we have calculated the\nelectronic band structure for FeTe0.66 Se0.34 . In the\ncalculations the plane wave basis method was used\n[24]. We adopted the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [25] for the exchangecorrelation potentials. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 7: (color online) Comparison of the band structure\nof the ARPES data and the DFT calculation results along\nthe \u0393-M cut. Note: the energy scale of the calculated band\nstructure at the right side is 3.125 times of the energy scale\nof the experimental data at the left side.\n\n[26] were used to model the electron-ion interactions. After the full convergence test, the kinetic energy cut-off\nand the charge density cut-off of the plane wave basis\nwere chosen to be 600 eV and 4800 eV, respectively. The\nGaussian broadening technique was used and a mesh of\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 8 k-points were sampled for the irreducible\nBrillouin-zone integration. The internal atomic coordinates within a cell were determined by the energy minimization. The doping effect upon electronic structures\nwas studied by using virtual crystal calculations.\nFig. 5 displays the calculated band structure, there are\nindeed three bands near \u0393, and two bands near M that\ncross the Fermi energy. In particular, the inner-most\nband near \u0393 does show significant dispersion along the\n\u0393 \u2212 Z direction. As a result, our calculations give five\nFermi surfaces as shown in Fig. 6. The calculated band\nstructure to a large extent resembles those of the ironarsenide superconductors.\nQualitatively, the calculated Fermi surfaces agree well\nwith our experiments. However, there are some important quantitative discrepancies. Fig. 7 illustrates the\nmeasured band structure along \u0393-M as reproduced from\nFig. 2(c), together with the calculated bands. One finds\nthat the size of the calculated \u03b3 Fermi surface is much\nsmaller than the measured one. However, the calculated\n\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands match the data after scaled by 3.125\nand shifted down by 45 meV, except the Fermi crossings\nof the measured and calculated \u03b3 band are different. The\nscaling factor illustrates the correlation effects in this material. The experimental Fermi velocity of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3\nbands are 0.62 eV \u00c5, 0.4 eV \u00c5, and 0.137 eV \u00c5 respectively. On the other hand, the measured Fermi surface\naround M is much smaller than the calculated ones. Similar to the iron-pnictides [27], the renormalization factors\nof the bands vary in different regions of the Brillouin\nzone.\nWe note that in order to obtain accurate band renor-\n\nFigure 8: (color online) (a) Cartoon of the polarization dependence experiment, and the symmetry of the orbitals with\nrespect to the mirror plane defined by sample normal and \u0393X.

Data were taken with 100 eV photons at\nSLS, and the temperature was 10 K.\n\nmalization factors, it is crucial to compare the data with\nthe calculation conducted for the same Se doping. We\nhave calculated the band structures of FeTe1\u2212x Sex with\na series of doping, and found that the band structure\naround \u0393 evolves rapidly with increasing Se concentration. Similar conclusion can be drawn from the published\nFeSe and FeTe band structures by Subedi and coworkers\n[28].\n\nV.\n\nPOLARIZATION DEPENDENCE\n\nFor a multi-band and multi-orbital superconductor, it\nis crucial to understand the orbital characters of the band\nstructure near EF . In photoemission, such information\ncan be obtained to a large extent in the polarization dependence. Fig. 8(a) illustrates two types of experimental\nsetup with linearly polarized light. The incident beam\nand the sample surface normal define a mirror plane. For\nthe \u03c0 (or \u03c3) experimental geometry, the electric field direction (\u03b5\u0302) of the incident photons is in (or out of) the\nmirror plane. The matrix element of the photoemission\n\n\f6\nprocess can be described by\nk\n|Mf,i\n| \u221d |h\u03c6kf |\u03b5\u0302 * r|\u03c6ki i|2\n\n, where \u03c6ki and \u03c6kf are the initial and final state wavefunctions respectively [29]. In our experimental setup,\nthe momentum of the final-state photoelectron is in the\nmirror plane, and \u03c6kf can be approximated by a plane\nwave. Therefore, \u03c6kf is always even with respect to the\nmirror plane. In the \u03c0 geometry, (\u03b5\u0302 * r) is even, to give a\nfinite photoemission matrix element, |\u03c6ki i must be even\nwith respect to the mirror plane. Thus only even state\nis probed in the \u03c0 experimental geometry. On the other\nhand, one could similarly deduce that only odd state is\nobserved in the \u03c3 geometry.\nIn contrast to the data measured with circularly polarized light in Figs. 2(i) and (j), only the \u03b2 band is observed\nin the \u03c3 geometry [Figs. 8(b) and (d)], while just the \u03b1\nand \u03b3 bands are observed in the \u03c0 geometry [Figs. 8(c)\nand (e)]. Based on the symmetry of different orbitals illustrated in Fig. 8(a), the \u03b2 band is odd with respect to\nthe mirror plane, while the \u03b1 and \u03b3 bands are even along\nthe \u0393-X direction. Therefore, the \u03b2 band has to be made\nof dxy and/or dyz orbitals, while the \u03b1 and \u03b3 bands may\nbe consisted of dx2 \u2212y2 , dz2 , and/or dxz .\nThese experimental findings of the symmetry properties of the band structure are well captured by the band\nstructure calculation. In Fig. 9, the orbital characters of\nthe bands are shown by the false color plot. Near the\nFermi energy, the \u03b1 band is mainly consisted of dxz /dyz\norbitals, which should be purely dxz along the \u0393 \u2212 X\ndirection. The \u03b2 band is consisted of mainly dxz and\ndyz orbitals, and some dxy orbitals; while the \u03b3 band is\nconsisted of dx2 \u2212y2 orbital. Along the \u0393 \u2212 Z direction,\nthe band structure near EF has some contributions from\nthe pz orbital and small contributions from the dz2 orbital. They all have even symmetry and thus can be\nobserved in the \u03c0 experimental geometry. The small ellipsoidal Fermi surface near zone center is mainly contributed by the dz2 orbital for FeAs-based compounds,\nwhile for Fe(Te0.66 Se0.34 ), Te/Se pz orbital plays an important role. To have a more quantitative picture, we\nhave listed the contributions of various orbitals to the\nstates at EF in Table. I, which are the coefficients of the\ncalculated corresponding Bloch wavefunctions projected\ninto the orbitals.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough the chalcogen ions contribute little spectral\nto the density-of-states (DOS) near the Fermi energy, the\nFe 3d related band structure in iron-chalcogenides does\nshow significant difference compared with that of ironpnictides. Recently, it is even proposed that the polarization of the As p orbitals might be the cause of the\nunconventional superconductivity in FeAs-based superconductors [11]. Therefore in this regard, the electronic\n\nFigure 9: (color online) Contributions of various Fe 3d\nand Te/Se p orbitals to the calculated band structure of\nFe(Te0.66 Se0.34 ).\n\nconsequences related to the chalcogen or pnicogen anions\nin the iron-based superconductors are particularly interesting to explore.\nIn general, Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) has similar Fermi surface and band structure as the iron-pnictides [22, 30].\nHowever, there are some important differences. For example, the three bands near \u0393 are well separated in this\niron-chalcogenides, each with distinct symmetry. On the\nother hand in recent polarization dependence studies of\nthe BaFe1.82 Co0.18 As2 , only two features around \u0393 were\nobserved [22]. Moreover, the inner feature is a mixture of\norbitals of both even and odd symmetries, while the outer\nfeature is even in symmetry. Moreover, our calculations\nshow that the Te 5p orbitals contribute to the density\nof states near the Fermi energy, while Fe 3dz2 orbital\ncontributes very little in this iron-chalcogenide. Furthermore, there is a small ellipsoidal Fermi surface near\nthe zone center of Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ), while for ironpnictides, such a small Fermi pocket has not been unambiguously observed in the paramagnetic normal state.\nCompared with the electronic structure of Fe1+y Te\nobtained earlier [31], the Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ) electronic\nstructure behaves differently in the following two aspects.\nFirst, three bands \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, are clearly observed\naround \u0393 for Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ), whereas only two bands\nwere distinguished in Fe1+y Te. Secondly, a weak Fermi\nsurface was observed around X-point in Fe1+y Te, which\nwas argued to be a folded Fermi surface by the spin density wave. For Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ), neutron scattering ex-\n\n\f7\nTable I: The contributions of Fe 3d and Te/Se p orbitals to the\nbands in Fe(Te0.66 Se0.34 ) near EF along the \u0393 \u2212 X direction.\ndxy\npz\ndxz\ndyz\ndx2 \u2212y 2\ndz 2\n\u03b1 0.0391 0.6702\n0\n0.0182\n0\n0.0791\n\u03b2\n0\n0\n0.6579\n0\n0.2359\n0\n\u03b3 0.0033 0.0434\n0\n0.9391\n0\n-0.0001\n\npx + py\n0.0767\n0.0463\n0.0069\n\nperiments have found incommensurate short-range magnetic order below 50 K [12], however, our measurements\nwith two different photon polarizations confirm the absence of states near EF around X. Furthermore, no band\nsplitting that is associated with the SDW in BaFe2 As2\nand SrFe2 As2 is observed here. This might suggest that\nsuch a short range magnetic order should be very weak\nin Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ).\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, we have studied the electronic structure of Fe1.04 (Te0.66 Se0.34 ).
