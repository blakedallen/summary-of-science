Introduction\nWe study the dynamical behavior of two family of maps, namely, monomial maps and polynomial maps. In particular, we focus on two aspects:\nalgebraic stability and degree growth. For monomial maps, we use the theory of toric varieties as the main tool. For polynomial maps, we focus on\n1\ntheir dynamical behavior on the space (P1 )n = P\n* * \u00d7 P1} .\n| \u00d7 *{z\nn\n\nGiven an n \u00d7 n integer matrix A = (ai,j ), there is an associated monomial\nmap fA : Cn \u2192 Cn defined by\nQ a\nQ a\nfA (x1 , * * * , xn ) = ( j xj 1,j , * * * , j xj n,j ).\n\nMonomial maps fit nicely into the framework of toric varieties and equivariant maps (also called toric maps) on them. In this paper, we try to make\nextensive use of the toric method to study the dynamics of monomial maps.\nThe idea of applying the theory of toric varieties to monomial maps is in\nfact not new. For example, Favre [3] used the orbit-cone correspondence of\nthe torus action to translate a criterion of algebraic stability to a condition\nabout cones in a fan, and uses it to classify monomial maps in the case of\ntoric surfaces. In order to generalize his result to higher dimension, one needs\na good understanding on pulling back cohomology classes under rational\nmaps. So we start from a formula of pulling back divisors in toric varieties\n(Theorem 4.1).\nWe then define the notion of algebraic stability and prove a criterion\nsimilar to the one in [3]. Results about stability are proven using the criterion. For example, we proved that every monomial polynomial map is\nalgebraically stable on (P1 )n . Also, we generalize some results of [3] to\nhigher dimension.\nTheorem 5.7. Suppose that A \u2208 Mn (Z) is an integer matrix.\n(1) If there is a unique eigenvalue \u03bb of A of maximal modulus, with\nalgebraic multiplicity one; then \u03bb \u2208 R, and there exists a simplicial\ntoric birational model X (maybe singular) and a k \u2208 N such that fAk\nis strongly algebraically stable on X.\n(2) If \u03bb, \u03bb\u0304 are the only eigenvalues of A of maximal modulus, also with\nalgebraic multiplicity one, and if \u03bb = |\u03bb|*e2\u03c0i\u03b8 , with \u03b8 6\u2208 Q; then there\nis no toric birational model which makes fA strongly algebraically\nstable.\nFor the definition of (strongly) algebraically stable, see section 5. We note\nthat many of the results concerning stabilization of monomial maps in this\npaper have been obtained independently by Mattias Jonsson and Elizabeth\nWulcan [9].\nNext, we focus on two spaces: the projective space Pn , and the product\nof the projective line (P1 )n . For the projective space Pn , the monomial map\nfA induces a rational map Pn 99K Pn , also denoted by fA . The pull back\nf \u2217 of a rational map f : Pn 99K Pn on H 1,1 (Pn ; R) is given by the degree of\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n3\n\nf . Thus we consider the degree sequence {deg(fAk )}\u221e\nk=1 . Results about the\ndegree sequence of monomial maps can be found in [1] and [8].\nIn particular, one can define the asymptotic degree growth\n1\n\n\u03b41 (fA ) = lim (deg(fAk )) k .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nHasselblatt and Propp ([8, Theorem 6.2]) proved that \u03b41 (fA ) = \u03c1(A), the\nspectral radius of the matrix A. We refine the above result and obtain the\nfollowing description of the asymptotic behavior of the degree sequence for\na general monomial map.\nTheorem 6.2. Given an n \u00d7 n integer matrix A with nonzero determinant,\nassume that \u03c1(A) is the spectral radius of A. Then there exist two positive\nconstants C1 \u2265 C0 > 0 and a unique integer l with 0 \u2264 l \u2264 n \u2212 1, such that\nC0 * kl * \u03c1(A)k \u2264 deg(fAk ) \u2264 C1 * kl * \u03c1(A)k\n\nfor all k \u2208 N.\nIn fact, (l + 1) is the size of the largest Jordan block of A among the ones\ncorresponding to eigenvalues of maximal modulus.\nMoreover, if the matrix A has some better property, then we can describe\nthe degree sequence even more precisely. This is the content of Theorem 6.6,\nTheorem 6.7, and the following theorem.\nTheorem 6.8. Assume that the matrix A is diagonalizable, and assume for\neach eigenvalue \u03bb of A of maximum modulus, \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is a root of unity. Then\nthere is a positive integer p, and p constants C0 , C1 , * * * , Cp\u22121 \u2265 1, such that\ndeg(fApk+l ) = Cl * |\u03bb1 |pk+l + O(|\u03bb2 |pk+l ),\n\nwhere l = 0, 1, * * * , p \u2212 1.\n\nLet us mention that the above theorems about the degree sequences of\nmonomial maps can be generalized to the case of weighted projective spaces.\nOn weighted projective spaces, we have the notion of weighted degree of a\ntoric map, and their growth under iterations follows the pattern as the\ndegree growth of monomial maps in projective spaces. This generalization\nis suggested to us by Mattias Jonsson. We introduce weighted projective\nspace briefly, and explain the generalization in \u00a76.3.\nOn (P1 )n , we obtain a concrete matrix representation for the pull back\non the Picard groups for general rational maps. We apply the matrix representation to give another proof of the above theorem of Hasselblatt and\nPropp about the first dynamical degree of a monomial map (Theorem 7.1).\nIn the last subsection (\u00a77.5) of this paper, we study the stability of polynomial maps on (P1 )n . As a result, we obtain the following characterization:\nTheorem 7.5. Let f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) be a polynomial map.\n(1) If each fj is dominated by a monomial term, the f is algebraically\nstable on (P1 )n .\n\n\f4\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n(2) Assume that, for some iterate f N = (f1 , * * * , fn ) of f , we have\n(N )\ndegzi (fj ) > 0 for all i, j = 1, * * * , n. Then f being algebraically\nstable on (P1 )n implies that each fj must have a dominant term.\nHere we say that a polynomial fj (z1 , * * * , zn ) is dominated by the monomial \u03bc if the coefficient of \u03bc in fj is non-zero, and degzi (fj ) = degzi (\u03bc) for\nall variables zi , i = 1, * * * , n.\nAcknowledgement.

He would also like to thank Jeff Diller, Mattias Jonsson, and\nCharles Favre for useful discussions and suggestions.\n2. Toric varieties\nIn this section, we give a brief survey of basic definitions and properties\nof toric varieties. For more detail, we refer the readers to [2] or [6].\n2.1. Cones and affine toric varieties. Let N \u223c\n= Zn be a lattice of rank\nn\n\u223c\nn, and NR := N \u2297Z R = R be the associated real vector space. A (convex)\npolyhedral cone in NR is a subset of the form\nk\nX\nri vi | ri \u2208 R\u22650 , vi \u2208 NR }\n\u03c3={\ni=1\n\nfor some finite set of vectors v1 , * * * , vk . In the case k = 0, we make the\nconvention that \u03c3 = {0}, the cone containing only the origin.\nThe dimension of a cone is the dimension of the R-linear subspace spanned\nby the generating set. A cone is strongly convex if it does not contain any\nline through the origin. A cone is rational if we can choose the generators\nv1 , * * * , vk from the lattice N . In what follows, by a cone we always mean\n\"a strongly convex, rational polyhedral cone\".\nFrom the lattice N we can form the dual lattice M := HomZ (N, Z), with\ndual pairing denoted by h , i. It is a lattice in the dual vector space\nMR := M \u2297Z R \u223c\n= HomR (NR , R) = N \u2228 .\nR\n\nThe dual cone\n\n\u03c3\u2228\n\nof \u03c3 is defined by\n\n\u03c3 \u2228 = {u \u2208 MR | hu, vi \u2265 0 for all v \u2208 \u03c3}.\n\nThe intersection S\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M is a finitely generated monoid by Gordan's\nlemma. The affine variety U\u03c3 := Spec(C[S\u03c3 ]) of the ring C[S\u03c3 ] is called the\naffine toric variety associated to the cone \u03c3. More concretely, a closed point\nin U\u03c3 corresponds to a semigroup morphism (S\u03c3 , +) \u2192 (C, *) which sends\n0 \u2208 S\u03c3 to 1 \u2208 C.\n\nExample 2.1. Let N = Z2 , and let \u03c3 be the cone in NR \u223c\n= R2 generated by\ne1 = (1, 0) and e2 = (0, 1). It is easy to see that S\u03c3 is the monoid generated\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n5\n\nby the dual basis e\u22171 , e\u22172 , and C[S\u03c3 ] \u223c\n= C[x, y]. Thus the affine toric variety\nU\u03c3 \u223c\n= Spec C[x, y] = C2 .\nExample 2.2. More generally, let N = Zn , and let \u03c3 be the cone in NR \u223c\n=\nRn generated by the standard basis e1 , * * * , en . Then the affine toric variety\nU\u03c3 \u223c\n= Cn .\nNow we are going to introduce some definitions about cones.\n\u2022 One dimensional cones are also called rays. On each ray, there is a\nunique nonzero integral point of the smallest norm ; it is called the\nray generator.\n\u2022 A cone is simplicial if it is generated by linearly independent vectors.\n\u2022 A cone is smooth if it is generated by part of a basis for the lattice\nN.\nWe remark here that a cone \u03c3 is smooth if and only if the corresponding\naffine variety U\u03c3 is smooth.\n2.2. Fans and general toric varieties. A fan \u03a3 in NR is a set of cones\nin NR satisfying the following two conditions:\n(1) each face of a cone in \u03a3 is a cone in \u03a3.\n(2) the intersection of two cones in \u03a3 is a face of each (hence also in \u03a3).\nUnless otherwise stated, we will assume that fans are finite, i.e., they contain\nfinitely many cones.\nFrom a fan \u03a3, we can construct the\n` toric variety X(\u03a3) corresponding to\n\u03a3. First, we take the disjoint union \u03c3\u2208\u03a3 U\u03c3 , then we glue them as follows.\nFor cones \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3, the intersection \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 is a face of each. Thus we have\nopen immersions\nU\u03c3 \u2190\u0593 U\u03c3\u2229\u03c4 \u0592\u2192 U\u03c4 .\nFor each pair of cones \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3, we glue U\u03c3 and U\u03c4 along the open subvariety\nU\u03c3\u2229\u03c4 . The gluing data will be compatible, and the resulting variety is the\ntoric variety X(\u03a3).\nWe use the notion \u03a3(k) to denote the set of all k-dimensional cones of\n\u03a3. The support of a fan \u03a3, denoted |\u03a3|, is the union of its cones, i.e.,\n|\u03a3| := \u222a\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 \u03c3. A fan \u03a3 is complete if |\u03a3| = NR . A fan is complete if\nand only if the corresponding toric variety is a complete variety, i.e., the\nunderlying topological space is compact in the classical topology. For a fan\n\u03a3, the toric variety X(\u03a3) is smooth if and only if every cone in \u03a3 is smooth.\nTo check smoothness, it is enough to check for all maximal cones in \u03a3, i.e.,\ncones that are not proper faces of any other cone.\nExample 2.3. Let N = Z2 , and let e0 = (\u22121, \u22121) = \u2212(e1 + e2 ). Let \u03c4i be\nthe ray generated by ei for i = 0, 1, 2, and \u03c3ij be the cone generated by ei\nand ej . The set\n\u03a3 = { {0}, \u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 , \u03c312 , \u03c302 , \u03c301 }\nis a fan, and the corresponding toric variety is the projective plane P2 .\nIn fact, if we set the homogeneous coordinate of P2 as [w; x; y], then we\n\n\f6\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\n\u03c42\n\n\u03c312\n\n\u03c302\n\u03c41\n\n\u03c40\n\n\u03c301\n\nFigure 1. The fan structure of P2 .\ncan identify U\u03c312 as Spec C[ wx , wy ] \u223c\n= {[w; x; y] \u2208 P2 |w 6= 0}.

More generally, let N = Zn , e1 , * * * , en be the standard\nbasis of N , and e0 = \u2212(e1 + * * * + en ). For any proper subset I of the set\nn = {0, 1, * * * , n}, i.e., I ( n, let \u03c3I be the cone generated by {ei |i \u2208 I}.\nThen the set \u03a3 = {\u03c3I |I ( n} forms a fan. The toric variety associated to\nthe fan is the projective space X(\u03a3) \u223c\n= Pn .\n\nExample 2.5. In this example, we will construct a fan \u03a3 that corresponds\n1\nto the product of the projective line (P1 )n = P\n* * \u00d7 P1} . There are 2n\n| \u00d7 *{z\nn\n\nrays in \u03a3. They are generated by the standard basis vectors e1 , * * * , en\nand their negatives \u2212e1 , * * * , \u2212en . The maximal cones, i.e., n-dimensional\ncones, are generated by vectors of the form {(s1 e1 ), * * * , (sn en )}, where si \u2208\n{+1, \u22121} are the signs. All other cones in \u03a3 are faces of some maximal\ncone. For example, the fan for P1 \u00d7 P1 has four maximal cones, generated\nby {e1 , e2 }, {\u2212e1 , e2 }, {e1 , \u2212e2 }, and {\u2212e1 , \u2212e2 }, respectively.\n\n2.3. The orbits of the torus action. Every toric variety X(\u03a3) is equipped\nwith a torus action, thus X(\u03a3) can be written as the disjoint union of the\norbits. The orbits are in 1-1 correspondence with cones in the fan \u03a3 in a nice\nway, as follows. First, for each cone \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3, there is a distinguished point\nx\u03c4 \u2208 U\u03c4 . It is the closed point corresponding to the following semigroup\nmorphism S\u03c3 \u2192 C.\n(\n1 if u \u2208 \u03c3 \u22a5 ,\nu 7\u2212\u2192\n0 otherwise.\nThen we define O\u03c4 to be the orbit of x\u03c4 under the torus action. The only\nclosed orbits are fixed points, which correspond to the n-dimensional cones.\nWe can take the closure of an orbit in the toric variety, it is called the orbit\nclosure of \u03c4 , denoted by V (\u03c4 ). An orbit closure itself is a toric variety, it is\na closed, toric subvariety of the original toric variety.\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n7\n\n3. Toric maps\n\u03a3\u2032\n\nSuppose A : N \u2192 N \u2032 is a homomorphism of lattices, \u03a3 is a fan in N , and\nis a fan in N \u2032 .\n\nDefinition. Given a cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, we say that \u03c3 maps regularly to \u03a3\u2032 by\nA if there is a cone \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032 such that A(\u03c3) \u2286 \u03c3 \u2032 . In this case, we call the\nsmallest such cone in \u03a3\u2032 the cone closure of the image of \u03c3, and denote it\nby A(\u03c3).\nIf A : N \u2192 N \u2032 is a homomorphism such that every cone of \u03a3 maps\nregularly to \u03a3\u2032 , then A induces a morphism of varieties fA : X(\u03a3) \u2192 X(\u03a3\u2032 ).\nFurthermore, fA will be equivariant under the torus action. Conversely,\nevery equivariant morphism X(\u03a3) \u2192 X(\u03a3\u2032 ) is induced by a homomorphism\nof lattices satisfying the above property. Equivariant morphisms will map\norbits to orbits. If \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, then fA maps O\u03c3 \u2282 X(\u03a3) to OA(\u03c3) \u2282 X(\u03a3\u2032 ).\nMore generally, any homomorphism of lattices A : N \u2192 N \u2032 induces an\nequivariant rational map fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3\u2032 ). On a complete toric variety,\nfA is dominant if and only if AR = (A \u2297 R) : NR \u2192 NR\u2032 is surjective. In this\npaper, we will study the dynamics of dominant, toric rational self maps on\ncomplete toric varieties.\n\u0001\nExample 3.1. Let the matrix A = ac db \u2208 M2 (Z), and identify N \u223c\n= Z2 as\ncolumn vectors. Then A : N \u2192 N is given by multiplying column vectors\nby A on the left. Let us see what fA does on the affine toric variety C2 we\nconstructed in Example 2.1. Notice that A induces the linear map t A on\nM , which sends e\u22171 7\u2192 a * e\u22171 + b * e\u22172 and e\u22172 7\u2192 c * e\u22171 + d * e\u22172 . The isomorphism\nC[S\u03c3 ] \u223c\n= C[x, y] is given by e\u22171 7\u2192 x and e\u22172 7\u2192 y, thus fA is the map x 7\u2192 xa y b\nand y 7\u2192 xc y d .\nExample 3.2. Let A = (ai,j ) be an n\u00d7n integer matrix, then using a similar\nargument as the above example, we can see that the map fA : Cn 99K Cn is\ngiven by\nQ a\nQ a\nfA (x1 , * * * , xn ) = ( j xj 1,j , * * * , j xj n,j ).\nSo we know on Cn , toric rational self maps are exactly monomial maps.\n3.1. Toric endomorphisms. Before we start to study the dynamics of\ntoric rational self maps, one might ask: what do we know about toric morphisms from a toric variety to itself? The following property provides an\nanswer. It turns out that those morphisms have quite simple structure.\nLet \u03a3 be a complete fan in NR . Let A : N \u2192 N be a homomorphism of\nlattice that maps each cone of \u03a3 regularly to \u03a3, then fA : X(\u03a3) \u2192 X(\u03a3) is\na toric morphism. Also assume that fA is dominant, i.e. AR : NR \u2192 NR is\nsurjective. Moreover, suppose that v1 , * * * , vd are the ray generators of \u03a3.\n\nProposition 3.1. There is a positive integer k such that Ak vi = ai vi for\nsome positive integers ai , i = 1, * * * , d. In particular, the iteration fAk :\nX(\u03a3) \u2192 X(\u03a3) maps every orbit onto itself.\n\n\f8\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nProof. We know that A maps each cone \u03c3 into some other cone \u03c3 \u2032 . Since AR\nis a surjective endomorphism of NR , it is indeed an R-linear automorphism.\nThus AR will preserve the dimension of cones in \u03a3. As a consequence, what\nAR does on the cones of \u03a3 is just permuting them (preserving the dimension).\nTherefore, for some integer k, AkR would fix every cone in \u03a3. In particular, for\none dimensional cones, we know that AkR (R\u22650 * vi ) = R\u22650 * vi . Furthermore,\nsince A : N \u2192 N and vi \u2208 N , we deduce that A(vi ) = ai vi for some positive\ninteger ni . Finally, the last sentence is an immediate consequence of the\nfirst sentence and the description of images of orbits under a morphism. \u0003\nExample 3.3. Given non-zero integers ai , the endomorphism of (P1 )n =\nP1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7P1 coming from the monomial map of Cn of the form f (x1 , x2 * * * , xn ) =\n(xa11 , xa22 , * * * , xann ) is toric. Conversely, every toric endomorphism of (P1 )n\nis of the form\nn\n1\n2\n)\nf (x1 , x2 * * * , xn ) = (xas(1)\n, xas(2)\n, * * * , xas(n)\n\nfor some permutation s \u2208 Sn .\nThe above example shows that, in general, the above proposition cannot\nbe improved. However, if the space X(\u03a3) is nice, there are possibly stronger\ncondition on the map A, as we can see in the following example.\nExample 3.4. For the space Pn , we know the one dimensional cones are\ngenerated by e0 , e1 * * * , en . Every n of them would form a basis for N , and\ne0 + e1 + * * * + en = 0. Applying Ak , we get a0 e0 + a1 e1 + * * * + an en = 0.\nThis will force a0 = a1 = * * * = an , and hence we know fAk ([x0 : * * * : xn ]) =\n[xa0 : * * * : xan ] for some positive integer a.\n4. Divisors on toric varieties\nDivisors are the main tool in the study of codimension-one geometry of\nvarieties. Since we work on toric varieties, the divisors that are invariant\nunder the torus action are especially important. We will recall basic definitions and properties of divisors in a toric variety, then prove a formula\nabout pulling back divisors.\n4.1. Weil Divisors and divisor class groups. In a toric variety, the\ntorus invariant prime Weil divisors are exactly the codimension one orbit\nclosures, i.e., V (\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1). Let \u03a3(1) = {\u03c41 , * * * , \u03c4d } be the (finite) set\nof rays inP\n\u03a3, a T -invariant Weil divisor, T -Weil divisor for short, is then of\nthe form di=1 ai V (\u03c4i ) where ai \u2208 Z. The group of T -Weil divisors, denoted\nWDivT (X(\u03a3)), then equals to \u2295di=1 Z*V (\u03c4i ), the free abelian group generated\nby the T -invariant prime divisors. The principal divisors in WDiv T (X(\u03a3))\nare in 1-1 correspondence to elements of M in the following way. For each\nelement u \u2208 M , there is a corresponding character (C\u2217 )n \u2192 C\u2217 which extend\nto a global meromorphic function \u03c7u on X(\u03a3). This gives the principal\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\ndivisor\ndiv(\u03c7u ) =\n\nd\nX\ni=1\n\n9\n\nhu, vi iV (\u03c4i ),\n\nwhere vi is the ray generator of \u03c4i . Conversely, every principal divisor in\nWDivT (X(\u03a3)) is of the form div(\u03c7u ) for some u \u2208 M . Hence we can identify\nM as a subgroup of WDivT (X(\u03a3)), and the quotient\nAn\u22121 (X(\u03a3)) := WDiv T (X(\u03a3))/M\nis the divisor class group of X(\u03a3).\n4.2. Cartier divisors and Picard groups. In a complete toric variety\nX(\u03a3) associated to a complete fan \u03a3, the torus invariant Cartier divisors,\nor for simplicity, T -Cartier divisors, is given by the following data. For each\ncone \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n) of maximal dimension, we specify an element u(\u03c3) \u2208 M . The\ndatum {u(\u03c3)|\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n)} are required to satisfy the compatibility condition\nthat [u(\u03c3)] = [u(\u03c3 \u2032 )] in M/M (\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 ), where M (\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 ) = (\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 )\u22a5 \u2229 M . We\nwrite D = {u(\u03c3)} and call it the Cartier divisor defined by the data {u(\u03c3)}.\nWe denote the group of all T-Cartier divisor by CDivT (X(\u03a3)).\nEach u(\u03c3) defines a T -Weil divisor div(\u03c7\u2212u(\u03c3) ) on U\u03c3 (the negative sign\nhere is to be consistent with the literature). The compatibility condition\nmeans these divisors agree on overlaps, thus every T -Cartier divisor D =\n{u(\u03c3)} gives rise to a unique T -Weil divisor\nX\n[D] =\n\u2212hu(\u03c3), vi i * V (\u03c4i ),\n\u03c4i \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\nhere \u03c3 in the summand is any maximal cone such that \u03c4i \u2208 \u03c3. The sum is\nindependent of the choice of \u03c3 by the compatibility condition.\nThe data {u(\u03c3)|\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n)} also defines a continuous piecewise linear function \u03c8D on NR . The restriction of \u03c8D to the maximal cone \u03c3 is given by u(\u03c3),\ni.e., \u03c8D (v) = hu(\u03c3), vi for v \u2208 \u03c3. The continuity comes from the compatibility. Conversely, a continuous piecewise linear function \u03c8 on NR , which is\nalso integral on each cone (i.e., given by an element of the lattice\nM on each\nP\ncone), determines a unique T -Cartier divisor D, with [D] =\n\u2212\u03c8(vi )*V (\u03c4i ).\nThe function \u03c8 is called the support function of the Cartier divisor D. On a\ncomplete toric variety, a T -Cartier divisor is ample if and only if its support\nfunction is strictly convex([6, p.70]).\nThere is a natural way to identify M as a subgroup of CDivT (X(\u03a3)).\nEach u \u2208 M is identified with the Cartier divisor such that u(\u03c3) = u for all\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n). The Weil divisor of this Cartier divisor is exactly the principal\ndivisor defined by \u03c7u . The quotient CDivT (X(\u03a3))/M is the Picard group of\nX(\u03a3), and is denoted by Pic(X(\u03a3)).\nWe conclude this section by mentioning relations between Picard groups\nand cohomology groups. For a complete toric variety X, we have Pic(X) =\nH 2 (X; Z). If X is also simplicial, then\nH 1,1 (X) := H 1 (X, \u03a9X ) = H 2 (X; C) = Pic(X) \u2297Z C.\n\n\f10\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\n4.3. Pulling back divisors. Assume that \u03a3, \u03a3\u2032 are complete fans in NR , NR\u2032 ,\nrespectively, which associates to the complete toric varieties X(\u03a3) and X(\u03a3\u2032 ).\nLet A be a homomorphism N \u2192 N \u2032 such that A \u2297Z R is surjective. It induces a dominant rational map fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3\u2032 ). We would like to\nstudy the pull back of a Cartier divisor on X(\u03a3\u2032 ), which gives, in general, a\nWeil divisor of X(\u03a3).\nA Cartier divisor on X(\u03a3\u2032 ) corresponds to a unique integral piecewise\nlinear function on \u03a3\u2032 . Let D be a Cartier divisor, with support function \u03c8D .\nTheorem 4.1. Let \u03a3, \u03a3\u2032 be complete fans, and fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3\u2032 ) be a\ndominant toric rational map induced by A : N \u2192 N \u2032 . The pull back of D\nvia fA is\nX\nfA\u2217 D =\n\u2212\u03c8D (Avi ) * V (\u03c4i ).\n\u03c4i \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\nHere the \u03c4i run through all one-dimensional cones of \u03a3, and vi is the ray\ngenerator of the ray \u03c4i .\ne such that A induces a toric\nProof. We can refine the fan \u03a3 to get a fan \u03a3\ne\nmorphism from X(\u03a3) to X(\u03a3). In order to distinguish from fA , we call this\ne \u2192 X(\u03a3) is induced by the identity\nmorphism feA . The morphism \u03c0 : X(\u03a3)\nmap on N . It is proper and birational. So we have the following diagram.\ne\nX(\u03a3)\n\nHH e\nw\nHH fA\n\u03c0 www\nHH\nHH\nww\nw\nH#\n{ww\nX(\u03a3) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _/ X(\u03a3\u2032 )\nfeA \u25e6\u03c0 \u22121\n\nWe are going to pull back the divisor D by first pull it back by feA , then\npush it forward by \u03c0, i.e., fA\u2217 D = \u03c0\u2217 (feA\u2217 D). Notice that once we show fA\u2217 is\ngiven by the above expression, then since the expression is independent of\ne so is f \u2217 .\nthe refined fan \u03a3,\nA\nA Cartier divisor D = {u(\u03c3); \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n)} is locally cut out by the equation\n\u03c7u(\u03c3) = 0 on U\u03c3 . The map A : N \u2192 N \u2032 induces the map M \u2032 \u2192 M defined\nby u 7\u2192 u \u25e6 A. Therefore, the pull back of D under the morphism feA is given\nby feA\u2217 D = {u(\u03c3) \u25e6 A}. We can also describe the pull back feA\u2217 D using its\nsupport function. If \u03c8D is the support function of D, then feA\u2217 D will have\n\u03c8D \u25e6 A as its support function. Thus, as a Weil divisor, we have\nX\nfeA\u2217 D =\n\u2212\u03c8D (Avi ) * V (\u03c4i ).\ne\n\u03c4i \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\ne is a subdivision of \u03a3, and \u03c0 is just the toric morphism induced\nThe fan \u03a3\nby identity. The push forward map \u03c0\u2217 is given, on the prime divisors V (\u03c4 )\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\ne\nfor \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1),\nby\n\n\u03c0\u2217 V (\u03c4 ) =\n\n(\n\nV (\u03c4 )\n0\n\n11\n\nif \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1),\nif \u03c4 \u2208\n6 \u03a3(1).\n\nTherefore, combining the two steps, we obtain\nX\nfA\u2217 D = \u03c0\u2217 (feA\u2217 D) =\n\u2212\u03c8D (Avi ) * V (\u03c4i ).\n\u03c4i \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that, if D is a principal divisor, i.e., \u03c8D is a linear function, then\nthe pull back fA\u2217 D will again be principal, given by the linear function \u03c8D \u25e6A.\nThus it induces a map, also denoted by fA\u2217 , from the Picard group to the\ndivisor class group.\nfA\u2217 : Pic(X(\u03a3\u2032 )) \u2192 An\u22121 (X(\u03a3)).\nIf the fan is smooth, then so is the toric variety, and the notions of Weil\ndivisors and Cartier divisors coincide. So the pull back map of a Cartier\ndivisor is still Cartier, and it induces a map on Picard groups.\nfA\u2217 : Pic(X(\u03a3\u2032 )) \u2192 Pic(X(\u03a3)).\nIn a simplicial toric variety, every Weil divisor D is Q-Cartier, i.e., some\npositive integral multiple of D is Cartier. Thus if we denote GQ = G \u2297Z Q\nfor an abelian group G, and assume that \u03a3, \u03a3\u2032 are simplicial, then we have\nboth maps\nfA\u2217 : CDivT (X(\u03a3\u2032 ))Q \u2192 CDivT (X(\u03a3))Q ,\nfA\u2217 : Pic(X(\u03a3\u2032 ))Q \u2192 Pic(X(\u03a3))Q .\n\nWe use the same symbol fA\u2217 here to avoid inventing too many notations, but\nit has the drawback of making confusions. Thus we will state clearly whether\nwe talk about divisors or divisor classes every time we use the symbol fA\u2217 .\nWhat we do for pulling back Q-Cartier divisors in the simplicial case\nis as follows. First, notice that an element D \u2208 CDivT (X(\u03a3\u2032 ))Q can be\nidentified with a rational support function \u03c8D , i.e., it takes rational values\non the ray generators. The composition (\u03c8D \u25e6 A) is piecewise linear on the\ne but not on \u03a3. We use the values of the function on rays to make\nfan \u03a3,\nan interpolation and obtain a piecewise linear function on \u03a3. This step is\npossible because \u03a3 is simplicial. If we denote the modifying (interpolation)\nfunction by \u03bc = \u03bc\u03a3,\u03a3\ne , we can describe it more concretely. Let \u03c6 be a rational\ne for a maximal cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n),\ncontinuous piecewise linear function on \u03a3,\nassume that \u03c41 * * * \u03c4n are one-dimensional\nfaces of \u03c3, with ray generators\nPn\n\u2217\nv1 , * * * , vn , then \u03bc(\u03c6)|\u03c3 = i=1 \u03c6(vi ) * vi . Here vi\u2217 is the dual basis of vi\nwith respect to the basis {v1 , * * * , vn }.\nTo sum up, we have the following:\n\n\f12\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nA(B\u03c4 )\n\n\u03c4\nB(\u03c4 )\n\nB(\u03c4 )\n\u03c3\u2032\n\nB\n\nA\n\nFigure 2.

For complete, simplicial toric varieties X(\u03a3), X(\u03a3\u2032 ), and a dominant toric rational map fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3\u2032 ), we can write the procedure\n\u0003\nof pulling back divisors as fA\u2217 D = \u03bc\u03a3,\u03a3\ne (\u03c8D \u25e6 A).\n5. Algebraic stability\nFor the rest of this paper, all toric varieties are assumed to be complete\nand simplicial.\n5.1. Definition and a geometric criterion.\nDefinition. A toric rational map fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3) is strongly algebraically stable if (fAk )\u2217 = (fA\u2217 )k as maps of CDivT (X(\u03a3))Q for all k \u2208 N. It\nis algebraically stable if (fAk )\u2217 = (fA\u2217 )k as maps of Pic(X(\u03a3))Q , for all k.\nNotice that (fAk )\u2217 = (fA\u2217 )k on CDivT (X(\u03a3))Q implies (fAk )\u2217 = (fA\u2217 )k\non Pic(X(\u03a3))Q , so the condition for strongly algebraic stability is indeed\nstronger than that for algebraic stability. It is not clear to us whether the\ntwo conditions are equivalent or not in general. However, if we assume\nthat the toric variety X = X(\u03a3) is projective, then the two conditions are\nequivalent. We will prove that later in this section.\nOur next goal is to prove a geometric characterization of strongly algebraically stable maps. We need to prove a lemma first. Given two homomorphisms of lattices A : N \u2192 N \u2032 and B : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 N , they induce two toric\nrational maps fA : X(\u03a3) \u2192 f (\u03a3\u2032 ) and fB : X(\u03a3\u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 f (\u03a3).\nLemma 5.1.

First, suppose that the geometric condition is satisfied, we want to\nshow (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 = fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 . Remember that (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D = \u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 (A \u25e6 B))\nand (fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D = fB\u2217 (fA\u2217 D) = \u03bc(\u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 A) \u25e6 B), where \u03bc is the modifying\nfunction. So it is enough to show that, for all \u03c4i \u2208 \u03a3(1) and vi the ray\ngenerator of \u03c4i ,\n(\u03c8D \u25e6 (A \u25e6 B))(vi ) = (\u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 A) \u25e6 B)(vi ),\nthat is, \u03c8D (A(Bvi )) = \u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 A)(Bvi ).\nSince A(B(\u03c4i )) \u2282 \u03c3 \u2032 for some \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032 and \u03c8D is linear on \u03c3 \u2032 , hence (\u03c8D \u25e6A)\nis linear on B(\u03c4i ). The interpolation \u03bc therefore does not do anything on\nB(\u03c4i ), and we have \u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 A)(Bvi ) = (\u03c8D \u25e6 A)(Bvi ).\nConversely, if for some ray \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1), B(\u03c4 ) does not map regularly by\nA. This means that A(B(\u03c4 )) is not contained in any cone of \u03a3\u2032 . We will\nconstruct a divisor D \u2208 CDivT (X(\u03a3\u2032 )) such that (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D 6= (fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D.\nLet \u03b31 , * * * , \u03b3m be the one-dimensional faces of \u03a3\u2032 , and for i = 1, * * * , m, let\n(\n0 if \u03b3i is a face of (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ),\nai =\n1 otherwise.\nPm\nDefine D = i=1 ai * V (\u03c4i\u2032 ), and let \u03c8D be the support function of D. First,\nobserve that \u03c8D (v) = 0 if and only if w \u2208 (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ). Thus for the divisor\n(fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D, the coefficient of V (\u03c4 ) is 0.\nOn the other hand, since A(B(\u03c4 )) is not contained in (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ), there\nis some one dimensional face \u03c40 of B(\u03c4 ) such that A(\u03c40 ) 6\u2208 (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ). Let\nv0 be the ray generator of \u03c40 , then \u03c8D (Av0 ) > 0. Thus \u03bc(\u03c8D \u25e6 A) is strictly\npositive in the relative interior of B(\u03c4 ), which contains Bv. This implies\nthat the coefficient of V (\u03c4 ) for the divisor (fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D is strictly positive.\nTherefore we have (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D 6= (fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.2. A toric rational map fA : X(\u03a3) 99K X(\u03a3) is strongly algebraically stable if and only if for all ray \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1) and for all n \u2208 N, An (\u03c4 )\nmaps regularly to \u03a3 by A.\nProof. First assume that f = fA is strongly algebraically stable. Thus for\nall n \u2208 N, we have (f n )\u2217 = (f \u2217 )n and (f n+1 )\u2217 = (f \u2217 )n+1 . This gives us\n(f \u25e6 f n )\u2217 = (f n+1 )\u2217 = (f \u2217 )n+1 = (f \u2217 )n \u25e6 f \u2217 = (f n )\u2217 \u25e6 f \u2217 .\n\nBy the above lemma, the equality (f \u25e6 f n )\u2217 = (f n )\u2217 \u25e6 f \u2217 implies that An (\u03c4 )\nis mapped regularly to \u03a3 by f .\nConversely, assume that An (\u03c4 ) is mapped regularly to \u03a3 by f for all\nn \u2208 N. This tells us that (f \u25e6 f n )\u2217 = (f n )\u2217 \u25e6 f \u2217 for all n \u2208 N . Thus we have\n(f n )\u2217 = (f \u2217 )n for all n \u2208 N by an induction argument.\n\u0003\nIn fact, let \u03c3n = An (\u03c4 ), the next lemma implies that, not only \u03c3n maps\nto \u03a3 regularly, also the cone closure A(\u03c3n ) is equal to \u03c3n+1 = An (\u03c4 ).\n\n\f14\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nLemma 5.3. Assume further that AR is surjective, and B(\u03c4 ) maps regularly\nto \u03a3\u2032 , then for all \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3\u2032\u2032 , we have A(B(\u03c4 )) = (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ).\n\nThat is, if \u03c3 is the smallest cone in \u03a3 that contains B(\u03c4 ), and \u03c3 \u2032 is the\nsmallest cone in \u03a3\u2032 that contains A(\u03c3), then \u03c3 \u2032 will be the smallest cone in\n\u03a3\u2032 that contains A(B(\u03c4 )).\n\nProof. Obviously, (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ) is a face of A(B(\u03c4 )). Thus there is a supporting\nhyperplane H \u2032 of A(B(\u03c4 )) in NR\u2032 such that\nA(B(\u03c4 )) \u2229 H \u2032 = (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ).\n\nThe preimage H = A\u22121 (H \u2032 ) will then be a supporting hyperplane of B(\u03c4 ) in\nNR , so B(\u03c4 ) \u2229 H is a face of B(\u03c4 ) that contains B(\u03c4 ). By the minimality of\nB(\u03c4 ), we must have B(\u03c4 ) \u2229 H = B(\u03c4 ), i.e., B(\u03c4 ) \u2282 H. Thus, A(B(\u03c4 )) \u2282 H \u2032 ,\nand by the minimality of A(B(\u03c4 )), we know A(B(\u03c4 )) \u2282 H \u2032 . Therefore,\nA(B(\u03c4 )) = A(B(\u03c4 )) \u2229 H \u2032 = (A \u25e6 B)(\u03c4 ).\n\u0003\nWith Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 5.3, we can describe the behavior, under\niterations, of an strongly algebraically stable toric rational map fA very\nconcretely, as follows. For each ray \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1), let \u03c31 = A(\u03c4 ) be the smallest\ncone containing A(\u03c4 ), then \u03c31 will map regularly to some cone in N , Assume\n\u03c32 = A(\u03c31 ) = A2 (\u03c4 ) is the smallest such cone. Here the second equality is\ndue to the lemma. Then \u03c32 will map regularly again to some smallest\n\u03c33 = A(\u03c32 ) = A2 (\u03c31 ) = A3 (\u03c4 ), and so on.\n5.2. Algebraic stable vs. strongly algebraic stable. Now we can prove\nthe equivalence of algebraic stable and strongly algebraic stable in the projective case. The equivalence of the two conditions, and a proof in the\ngeneral case is mentioned to us by C. Favre. We adapted his proof to a\nproof for toric varieties.\nGiven two integer matrices A, B \u2208 Mn (Z) with nonzero determinants,\nwhich induce two dominant toric rational maps fA , fB : X 99K X.\nLemma 5.4. Let D be an ample, T -invariant divisor on X, then the difference (fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D \u2212 (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D is an effective Q-Cartier divisor.\nProof. Write\n(fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 )D =\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\na\u03c4 V (\u03c4 ),\n\n(fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 D =\n\nX\n\nb\u03c4 V (\u03c4 ).\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u03a3(1)\n\nWe will show that a\u03c4 \u2265 b\u03c4 for every \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1), which is equivalent to the\nlemma.\nLet \u03c8 = \u03c8D be the support function of D. For some \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1), let v \u2208 \u03c4\nbe the ray generator. Let \u03c3 = B\u03c4 be the smallest cone which contains B\u03c4 ,\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n15\n\nand assume that u1 , * * * , ud are the generators of the cone \u03c3. Then there\nare positive numbers r1 , * * * , rd such that B(v) = r1 u1 + * * * + rd ud .\nBy the formula for pulling back divisors, to compute a\u03c4 , we need to apply\nthe interpolation process, and obtain\na\u03c4 = \u2212[r1 \u03c8(Au1 ) + * * * + rd \u03c8(Aud )].\nWe can also see that\nb\u03c4 = \u2212\u03c8((A \u25e6 B)(v)) = \u2212\u03c8(r1 Au1 + * * * + rd Aud ).\nNow the fact a\u03c4 \u2265 b\u03c4 comes from the fact that \u03c8 is (strictly) convex since\nD is ample.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.5. For a projective, complete, simple toric variety X =\nX(\u03a3), a toric rational map fA is strongly algebraically stable if and only if\nit is algebraically stable.\nProof. Since strongly AS implies AS, it suffices to show the other direction.\nAssume that fA is not strongly AS, then there is a ray \u03c4 and a positive\ninteger k such that Ak (A\u03c4 ) is not contained in any cone of \u03a3.\nLet D be any ample divisor, using the same notation as in the proof of\nthe above lemma, with B = Ak , we can see that a\u03c4 > b\u03c4 , since the A(ui )'s\nare not in a same cone, and \u03c8 is strictly convex.\nThus the difference between the support functions of (fAk+1 )\u2217 D and that\nof (f \u2217 )k+1 D is a nonnegative function which is strictly positive on \u03c4 , hence\ncannot be linear. This means (f k+1 )\u2217 D 6= (f \u2217 )k+1 D in Pic(X).\n\u0003\n5.3. Applications of the criterion. We will apply the above criterion\n(Theorem 5.2) to give some results about stabilization in certain cases.\nFirst, suppose all entries of A are non-negative, i.e., fA is a polynomial\nmonomial map. There is a nice nonsingular toric model on which fA is\nalgebraically stable, namely (P1 )n .\nProposition 5.6. Every monomial polynomial map is strongly algebraically\nstable on (P1 )n , hence algebraically stable.\nProof. Let \u03a3 be the fan such that X(\u03a3) = (P1 )n . The rays of \u03a3 are given\nby \u03c4i = R\u22650 * ei and \u2212\u03c4i , for i = 1, * * * , n. The morphism A maps each of\n\u03c4i into the cone \u03c3+ generated by e1 , * * * , en , and maps each of \u2212\u03c4i into the\ncone \u03c3\u2212 generated by \u2212e1 , * * * , \u2212en .\nObserve that the compositions of polynomial maps are still polynomial\nmaps. So Ak are all polynomial monomial maps for k \u2265 1. Also notice\nthat Ak (\u03c4i ) \u2282 \u03c3+ , so Ak (\u03c4i ) is a face of \u03c3+ . Hence there is a subset of\nindexes I \u2282 {1, * * * , n} such that Ak (\u03c4i ) is generated by {ei |i \u2208 I}. Since\neach Ak (ei ) \u2208 \u03c3+ , we have that A(Ak (\u03c4i )) \u2282 \u03c3+ . This means Ak (\u03c4i ) maps\nregularly for all k. By symmetry, we also know that A(Ak (\u2212\u03c4i )) \u2282 \u03c3\u2212 .\nTherefore, the map fA is strongly algebraically stable on X(\u03a3) = (P1 )n . \u0003\n\n\f16\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nWe will discuss more properties of monomial maps on (P1 )n in Section 7.\nThe above property is about maps on a fixed toric variety (P1 )n . Next, we\nwill fix some map, and ask whether there exists a toric variety on which\nthe map is strongly algebraically stable. We give partial answers for maps\nsatisfying some conditions.\nTheorem 5.7. Suppose that A \u2208 Mn (Z) is an integer matrix.\n(1) If there is a unique eigenvalue \u03bb of A of maximal modulus, with\nalgebraic multiplicity one; then \u03bb \u2208 R, and there exists a simplicial\ntoric birational model X (maybe singular) and a k \u2208 N such that fAk\nis strongly algebraically stable on X.\n(2) If \u03bb, \u03bb\u0304 are the only eigenvalues of A of maximal modulus, also with\nalgebraic multiplicity one, and if \u03bb = |\u03bb|*e2\u03c0i\u03b8 , with \u03b8 6\u2208 Q; then there\nis no toric birational model which makes fA strongly algebraically\nstable.\nProof. For (1), let v \u2208 Rn be the eigenvector corresponding to the largest\nreal eigenvalue \u03bb, then the subspace Rv is attracting. We can find integral\nvectors v1 , * * * , vn , linearly independent over R, such that\n\u2022 v is in the interior of the cone generated by v1 , * * * , vn .\n\u2022 An (Rvi ) \u2192 Rv for all i = 1, * * * , n, as elements of RPn .\nThe rays {R\u22650 * vi , R\u22650 * (\u2212vi ) | i = 1 * * * , n} generates a fan \u03a3 similar to the\nway we form P1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 . That is, the maximal cones of \u03a3 are generated\nby the sets {s1 v1 , * * * , sn vn } where si \u2208 {+1, \u22121}. All other cones are faces\nof some maximal cone. It is easy to see that for some k, fAk is strongly\nalgebraically stable on X(\u03a3).\nTo prove (2), let \u03bb, \u03bb\u0304 be the largest eigenvalue pair, and \u0393 \u2282 Rn be the\ntwo dimensional invariant subspace corresponding to them. Since the fan \u03a3\nis complete, there is at least one ray \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(1) such that under iterations,\nAk \u03c4 will approach \u0393. Moreover, since A|\u0393 is an irrational rotation on rays,\nwe know that for all v \u2208 \u0393, there is a sequence ki such that Aki \u03c4 \u2192 R\u22650 * v.\nConsider the set \u03a3 \u2229 \u0393 = {\u03c3 \u2229 \u0393 | \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3}, it is a fan in \u0393. Each cone in\nit is strictly convex, but not necessarily rational. Pick v0 \u2208 \u0393 which lies in\nthe interior of some two dimensional cone of \u03a3 \u2229 \u0393, and pick a sequence ki\nsuch that Aki \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c40 = R\u22650 * v0 .\nSince Aki \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c40 and \u03a3 consists of only finitely many cones, there must be\nsome k such that \u03c40 \u2208 Ak \u03c4 . But \u03c40 is in the interior of some two dimensional\ncone of \u03a3\u2229\u0393, so we know that Ak \u03c4 \u2229\u0393 is a two dimensional cone in \u0393. Finally,\nwe know that Ak \u03c4 \u2229 \u0393 cannot map regularly under all Ak , so Ak \u03c4 cannot\neither. Thus A can never be made strongly algebraically stable.\n\u0003\nWe do not know what the correct statement would be for the missing case\n\u03bb = |\u03bb| * e2\u03c0i \u03b8 , with \u03b8 \u2208 Q.\nRemark. Some of our results in the last section and this section were obtained independently by Mattias Jonsson and Elizabeth Wulcan [9]. They\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n17\n\nobtained the pull back formula and the criterion for stability. One of the\nmain theorems in their paper [9, Theorem A'] deal with smooth stabilization\nof a monomial map by refining a given fan. This aspect of the stabilization\nis more delicate and is not discussed in our paper. Part (1) of Theorem 5.7\nin the current paper is similar to the Theorem B in [9]. The difference is that\nthey have further assumption on the eigenvalues, thus they can guarantee\nthat fA is already stable. They also discuss the special case of monomial\nmaps on toric surfaces (two dimensional toric varieties), which is not dealt\nin this paper.\n6. Monomial maps on projective spaces\nThe motivation for studying toric rational maps comes from the study\nof monomial maps on projective spaces. So let us come back to monomial\nmaps and try to understand more about them with the help of techniques\nfrom toric varieties. Some results in this section is well known, but we give\nanother proof from a toric viewpoint.\n6.1. Pulling back divisors and divisor classes. In this subsection, we\nwill show that pulling-back divisors tells us information about homogenization of a monomial map on projective spaces, and pulling-back divisors\nclasses tells us information about the degree of a monomial map on projective spaces.\nGiven an n \u00d7 n integer matrix A = (ai,j )1\u2264i,j\u2264n , the associated monomial\nmap Cn \u2192 Cn is given by\n\u0010Q\n\u0011\nQn\na1,j\nn\nan,j .\n(X1 , * * * , Xn ) 7\u2212\u2192\nX\nX\n,\n*\n*\n*\n,\nj=1 j\nj=1\n\nThen we use the embedding Cn \u0592\u2192 Pn defined by (X1 , * * * , Xn ) 7\u2192 [1; X1 ; * * * ; Xn ]\nto identify Cn with the open subset U0 = {x0 6= 0} \u2282 Pn . The inverse map\nU0 \u2192 Cn is given by Xi = xi /x0 , and this is used to homogenize the monomial map. After homogenizing, there is another integer matrix, with size\n(n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1), denoted by h(A) = (bi,j )0\u2264i,j\u2264n , such that\ni\nhQ\nQn\nb0,j\nbn,j\nn\n.\nfA ([x0 ; * * * ; xn ]) =\nx\n;\n*\n*\n*\n;\nx\nj=0 j\nj=0 j\n\nRecall the structure of the fan associated to the projective space. The\none dimensional cones are generated by the standard basis e1 , * * * , en and\ne0 = \u2212(e1 +* * *+en ). Denote them by \u03c4i = R\u22650 *ei for i = 0, * * * , n. Consider\nthe divisors Di = V (\u03c4i ) = {xi = 0}. If we want to pull it back by fA , what\nwe do is to pull back the defining equation. This will give us the equation\nQn\nbi,j\n= 0, which means\nj=0 xj\nfA\u2217 (Di ) = bi,0 * D0 + bi,1 * D1 + * * * + bi,n * Dn .\n\nOn the other hand, by Theorem 4.1, if \u03c8i is the support function of the\ndivisor Di , then\nfA\u2217 (Di ) = \u2212\u03c8i (Ae0 ) * D0 \u2212 \u03c8i (Ae0 ) * D1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c8i (Aen ) * Dn .\n\n\f18\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nThus we obtain the equality bi,j = \u2212\u03c8i (Aej ).\nExample 6.1.\n\u0001 Consider the monomial map fA associated to the matrix\n\u22122 . We know f (X, Y ) = (X \u22121 Y \u22122 , X 2 ) on C2 , and then usA = \u22121\nA\n2 0\ning homogenization, we can write down the formula for fA : P2 99K P2 as\nfA [w; x; y] = [w2 xy 2 ; w5 ; x3 y 2 ].\nLet us consider the divisor V (\u03c40 ) = {w = 0}. By pulling back the defining function, we know fA\u2217 (V (\u03c40 )) is defined by w2 xy 2 = 0, which, as a\ndivisor, is 2 * V (\u03c40 ) + 1 * V (\u03c41 ) + 2 * V (\u03c42 ). To apply the above discussion,\nremember that V (\u03c40 ) corresponds to the support function \u03c80 on \u03a3 such\nthat \u03c80 (e0 ) = \u22121 and \u03c80 (e1 ) = \u03c80 (e2 ) = 0. It is not hard to see that\n\u03c80 (a1 , a2 ) = min{0, a1 , a2 }. Therefore,\nfA\u2217 (V (\u03c40 )) = \u2212\u03c80 (Ae0 ) * V (\u03c40 ) \u2212 \u03c80 (Ae1 ) * V (\u03c41 ) \u2212 \u03c80 (Ae2 ) * V (\u03c42 )\n= 2 * V (\u03c40 ) + 1 * V (\u03c41 ) + 2 * V (\u03c42 ).\n\nIn general, the formulae of \u03c8i for Pn is as follows.\n(\n\u03c80 (a1 , * * * , an ) = min{0, a1 , * * * , an },\n(6.1)\n\u03c8i (a1 , * * * , an ) = min{0, \u2212ai , aj \u2212 ai ; j 6= i} for i = 1, * * * , n.\nSince the homogenization matrix h(A) = (\u2212\u03c8i (Aej )) is related to the\npulling back divisors, we can translate the condition of algebraic stability to\na condition on h(A).\nProposition 6.1. A monomial map fA : Pn 99K Pn is strongly algebraically\nstable if and only if h(Ak ) = h(A)k for k = 1, 2, * * * .\n\nProof. The entries of the i-th row in h(Ak ) are the coefficients of (fAk )\u2217 (V (\u03c4i )),\nwhereas the entries of the i-th row in h(A)k are the coefficients of (fA\u2217 )k (V (\u03c4i )).\nThe proposition then follows from the fact that CDivT (Pn ) is generated by\nV (\u03c40 ), * * * , V (\u03c4n ).\n\u0003\nWhat happened in unstable cases is that when we iterate the map h(A)\ndirectly, some terms got canceled out. For example, the map we mentioned\nabove fA : [w; x; y] 7\u2192 [w2 xy 2 ; w5 ; x3 y 2 ] is not stable, because when we\niterate once, the map\n[w; x; y] 7\u2192 [w9 x8 y 8 ; w10 x5 y 10 ; w15 x6 y 4 ]\n\nwhich corresponds to h(A)2 , has a common factor w9 x5 y 4 on each component; so we need to divide all components by w9 x5 y 4 , and obtain [w; x; y] 7\u2192\n[x3 y 4 ; wy 6 ; w6 x], whose components corresponds to h(A2 ).\nNext, we turn our attention to the pull back of divisor classes, i.e., elements of Pic(Pn ). It is well known that Pic(Pn ) \u223c\n= Z, and the isomorphism\nis given by the\ndegree.\nWe\nthus\nhave\nthe\nmap\ndeg\n: CDivT (Pn ) \u2192 Pic(Pn )\nP\nP\ngiven by deg( ai V (\u03c4i )) =\nai . Furthermore, for a monomial map fA on\nthe projective space, it is easy to deduce that the pull back on Picard group\nis the same as the degree of the map, and is given by deg(fA\u2217 D) for any\ndivisor D of degree one. We also denote this number by deg(fA ). If \u03c8 is the\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n19\n\nsupport function for D, then we know the degree of the monomial map fA\nis given by\n(6.2)\n\ndeg(fA ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212\u03c8(Aei ).\n\nFor example, let \u03c8 be any one of the \u03c8i listed in (6.1), then we can get a\nconcrete formula for deg(fA ). In particular, let \u03c8 = \u03c80 , we have\n\u2212\u03c8(a1 , * * * , an ) = \u2212\u03c80 (a1 , * * * , an )\n\n= \u2212 min{0, a1 , * * * , an }\n\n= max{0, \u2212a1 , * * * , \u2212an }.\nThen we rediscover the formula in [8, Proposition 2.14].\ndeg(fA ) =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nn\no\nn X\naij .\nmax {0, \u2212aij } + max 0,\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nj=1\n\nThe definition of algebraic stability for rational maps on Pn states that\nfA is algebraically stable if and only if deg(fAk ) = deg(fA )k for all k. Another property of the degree sequence is that it is submultiplicative, i.e.,\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndeg(fAk+k ) \u2264 deg(fAk ) * deg(fAk ). We will use this property several times in\nthe next subsection.\n6.2. Estimates of the degree sequence. In this subsection, we are going\nto study the degree sequence {deg(fAk )}\u221e\nk=1 . We are particularly interested\nin the asymptotic behavior of the degree sequence. An important numerical\ninvariant is the asymptotic degree growth\n1\n\n\u03b41 (fA ) = lim (deg(fAk )) k .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nIt is known that for a monomial map fA , \u03b41 (fA ) = \u03c1(A), the spectral radius\nof the matrix A ([8, Theorem 6.2]). We will refine this result and give more\nprecise estimates on the degree growth of a monomial map.\nRemark. For Pn , the asymptotic degree growth is the same as the first\ndynamical degree, which will introduce in more detail in Section 7.2.\n\u221e\nFor two sequences {\u03b1k }\u221e\nk=1 and {\u03b2k }k=1 of positive real numbers, we\nsay that they are asymptotically equivalent, denoted by \u03b1k \u223c \u03b2k , if there\nexists two positive constants c1 \u2265 c0 > 0, independent of k, such that\nc0 * \u03b2k \u2264 \u03b1k \u2264 c1 * \u03b2k for all k.\nLet us start from some examples. In the following examples, we assume\nthat a > b > 0 are two natural numbers.\n\u0001\nExample 6.2. For A = a0 0b , i.e., fA is the map (x, y) 7\u2192 (xa , y b ) on C2 .\nIt is easy to see that deg(fAk ) = ak .\n\n\f20\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nExample 6.3. For A =\nk\n\nk\u22121\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 (xa y ka\n\nk\n\n, ya )\n\n\u0001\n\na 1 , then\n0 a\non C2 . Thus\n\nAk =\n\nak kak\u22121\n0\nak\n\n\u0001\n, i.e., fAk is the map\n\nfor large k (more precisely, for k \u2265 a),\n\ndeg(fAk ) = ak + kak\u22121 = (1 + k/a) * ak \u223c k * ak .\n\nThis shows that in the non-diagonalizable case, we may have some polynomial multiplying with the power of the spectral radius in the estimate.\n\u0001\n0\n\u2212a b\nExample 6.4. For A = \u2212a\n0 b , i.e., fA is the map (x, y) 7\u2192 (x , y ) on\n2\nC . It is not hard to verify that\n(\nak\nfor k even,\nk\ndeg(fA ) =\nk\nk\na +b\nfor k odd.\nThe degree depends on the parity of k, but we still have deg(fAk ) \u223c ak .\nMoreover, the sequence {deg(fAk )/ak }\u221e\nk=1 has only one limit point.\n\u0010 \u2212a 0 0 \u0011\n0 \u2212a 0 , the map fA : C3 \u2192 C3 is given by\nExample 6.5. For A =\n0\n\n0 b\n\n(x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x\u2212a , y \u2212a , z b ). The degree sequence of fA is\n(\nak\nfor k even,\nk\ndeg(fA ) =\nk\nk\n2*a +b\nfor k odd.\n\nWe still have deg(fAk ) \u223c ak , but the sequence {deg(fAk )/ak }\u221e\nk=1 has two limit\npoints: 1 and 2.\nExample 6.6. Moreover, consider the monomial map f : Cn 99K Cn defined\na\na\na\nby f (x1 , * * * , xn ) = (x\u2212a\n2 , x3 , * * * , xn , x1 ). A careful calculation will show\nthat deg(f k ) \u223c ak , and the sequence {deg(fAk )/ak }\u221e\nk=1 has n limit points:\n1, 2, * * * , n \u2212 1 and n.\nExample\n\u0001 6.7. Consider the monomial map fA associated to the matrix A =\n\u22121 \u22122 , as in Example 6.1. The matrix A has two conjugate eigenvalues\n2 0\n\u221a\n\u03bb = (\u22121 + \u221215)/2 and \u03bb\u0304; and \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is not a root of unity. We will show\nin Theorem 6.2 that deg(fAk ) \u223c |\u03bb|k , but when we consider the sequence\n{deg(fAk )/|\u03bb|k }\u221e\nk=1 , we no longer have finitely many limit points. In fact, we\nwill prove that the sequence is dense in some interval (Proposition 6.9).\nThe main result for general monomial maps is the following theorem.\nTheorem 6.2. Given an n \u00d7 n integer matrix A with nonzero determinant,\nassume that \u03c1(A) is the spectral radius of A. Then there exist two positive\nconstants C1 \u2265 C0 > 0 and a unique integer l with 0 \u2264 l \u2264 n \u2212 1, such that\n(6.3)\n\nC0 * kl * \u03c1(A)k \u2264 deg(fAk ) \u2264 C1 * kl * \u03c1(A)k\n\nfor all k \u2208 N. Or, equivalently, deg(fAk ) \u223c kl * \u03c1(A)k .\nIn fact, (l + 1) is the size of the largest Jordan block of A among the ones\ncorresponding to eigenvalues of maximal modulus.\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n21\n\nThe idea we use to prove the theorem is the following observation. The assignment A 7\u2192 deg(fA ) can be extended naturally to a function \u03bd : Mn (R) \u2192\nR, and the function \u03bd is almost a norm on Mn (R). Thus some techniques\non norms also applies to the study of degrees.\nMore precisely, in formula (6.2), notice that the right hand side can be\ndefined over the real numbers because \u03c8 is a continuous piecewise linear\nfunction defined on NR \u223c\n= Rn . The only requirement is that the associated\ndivisor of \u03c8 has degree one. Thus, we define a function \u03bd : Mn (R) \u2192 R by\n(6.4)\n\n\u03bd(M ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212\u03c8(M ei ).\n\nProposition 6.3. The following properties hold for the function \u03bd.\n(i) Any support function \u03c8 of a T -divisor of degree one on Pn will give\nthe same \u03bd, i.e., \u03bd is independent of the choice of \u03c8.\n2\n(ii) \u03bd is a continuous function when we equip Mn (R) \u223c\n= Rn and R with\nthe usual topology of the Euclidean spaces.\n(iii) \u03bd(M ) \u2265 0, and \u03bd(M ) = 0 if and only if M = 0. Thus, in fact, we\nhave \u03bd : Mn (R) \u2192 R\u22650 .\n(iv) \u03bd(rM ) = r * \u03bd(M ) for r \u2265 0.\n(v) \u03bd(M + M \u2032 ) \u2264 \u03bd(M ) + \u03bd(M \u2032 ).\nProof. First, notice that (ii) is true because \u03c8 is continuous, and (iv) is true\nbecause \u03c8 is linear on each ray. Then (i) follows by (ii), (iv), and the fact\nthat \u03bd(A) = deg(fA ) for A \u2208 Mn (Z), which is independent of \u03c8.\nOnce we know that \u03bd is independent of the choice of \u03c8, one can pick any\n\u03c8, e.g. \u03c8 = \u03c80 , and prove (iii) and (v) directly. However, we would like to\noffer a more intrinsic explanation for (iii) and (v).\nSince \u03c8 is the support function for a degree one divisor D on Pn , we know\nthat D is very ample, and hence \u03c8 is strictly convex (see [6, p.70]). The first\npart of (iii), and (v), can be easily deduced from convexity. Strict convexity\nis needed to show that \u03bd(M ) = 0 implies M = 0.\nSuppose M 6= 0, then M e0 , M e1 , * * * , M en cannot be all zero. But since\nM e0 + * * * + M en = 0, and the cones in the fan for Pn are strongly convex\n(they do not contain any line through the origin), M e0 , * * * , M en cannot all\nlie in the same cone. Thus by strict convexity, we know\n\u03bd(M ) = \u2212\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\nn\nX\nM ei ) = \u03c8(0) = 0.\n\u03c8(M ei ) > \u2212\u03c8(\ni=0\n\n\u0003\nBy properties (iii)\u2013(v), we know that the only reason to prevent \u03bd from\nbeing a norm is that we may have \u03bd(M ) 6= \u03bd(\u2212M ). Indeed, for the n \u00d7 n\nidentity matrix In , we have \u03bd(In ) = 1, but \u03bd(\u2212In ) = n \u2212 1. So \u03bd is not a\nnorm. However, if we define \u03bd\u0304(M ) = \u03bd(M ) + \u03bd(\u2212M ), then \u03bd\u0304 is a norm.\n\n\f22\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nBefore we prove Theorem 6.2, we need an elementary lemma from linear\nalgebra.\nLemma 6.4. For an n \u00d7 n matrix A \u2208 Mn (C) and any norm k*k defined on\nMn (C), there exists two positive constants c1 \u2265 c0 > 0 and a unique integer\nl with 0 \u2264 l \u2264 n \u2212 1, such that\n(6.5)\n\nc0 * kl * \u03c1(A)k \u2264 kAk k \u2264 c1 * kl * \u03c1(A)k\n\nfor all k \u2208 N. Here \u03c1(A) is the spectral radius of A, and (l + 1) is the size\nof the largest Jordan block among those blocks corresponding to eigenvalues\nof maximal modulus \u03c1(A).\nProof. It suffices to prove the lemma for the L\u221e norm on Mn (C). Thus, for\nA = (aij ), we set kAk = kAk\u221e = maxi,j {|aij |} for the rest of the proof.\nObserve that kABk \u2264 n * kAk * kBk. If we write A = P JP \u22121 , where J is\nthe Jordan canonical form of A, then we have\n(n2 * kP k * kP \u22121 k)\u22121 * kJ k k \u2264 kAk k \u2264 (n2 * kP k * kP \u22121 k) * kJ k k.\n\u0001\nFor large k, it is easy to see that kJ k k = kl * \u03c1(A)k \u223c kl * \u03c1(A)k , where\n(l + 1) is as described above. Hence the lemma follows.\n\u0003\nNow we are ready to proof the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 6.2. For the matrix A \u2208 Mn (Z), consider the set\nn\n\nAk\nkl \u03c1(A)k\n\no\nk \u2208 N \u2282 Mn (R).\n\nBy lemma 6.4, it is a subset of a compact set S = {M \u2208 Mn (R) | c0 \u2264\nkM k \u2264 c1 } for some c1 \u2265 c0 > 0. Since \u03bd is continuous, we have \u03bd(S) \u2282\n[C0 , C1 ] for some reals C1 \u2265 C0 \u2265 0. Moreover, 0 6\u2208 S, thus C0 > 0. This\ngives us\n\u0010\n\u0011\nAk\nC0 \u2264 \u03bd l\n\u2264 C1 .\nk * \u03c1(A)k\nfor all k \u2208 N, with C1 \u2265 C0 > 0.\nFinally, since kl * \u03c1(A)k > 0, and \u03bd(Ak ) = deg(fAk ), we have\nC0 * kl * \u03c1(A)k \u2264 deg(fAk ) \u2264 C1 * kl * \u03c1(A)k\nThis concludes the proof.\nCorollary 6.5. If A is diagonalizable, then we have\n(6.6)\n\nC0 * \u03c1(A)k \u2264 deg(fAk ) \u2264 C1 * \u03c1(A)k\n\nfor some constants C1 \u2265 C0 \u2265 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n23\n\nProof. In the diagonalizable case, l = 0, hence we have (6.6). Recall that\nthe degree sequence is submultiplicative. Thus, if we have\nfor some k, then\n\nk)\ndeg(fA\n\u03c1(A)k\n\n=r<1\n\ndeg(fAkj )\ndeg(fAk )j\n\u2264\n= r j \u2192 0 as j \u2192 +\u221e.\n\u03c1(A)kj\n\u03c1(A)kj\nThis contradicts the existence of C0 > 0. Therefore,\nand we can choose C0 \u2265 1.\n\nk)\ndeg(fA\n\u03c1(A)k\n\n\u2265 1 for all k,\n\u0003\n\nIf we impose more conditions on the matrix A, we can obtain more precise\nestimates on the degree sequence.\nTheorem 6.6. Assuming that the matrix A is diagonalizable, and there is a\nunique eigenvalue \u03bb1 of maximal modulus, which is real and positive. Also,\nassume that the eigenvalues of A are arranged as \u03bb1 > |\u03bb2 | \u2265 |\u03bb3 | \u2265 * * * \u2265\n|\u03bbm | for some m. Then there is a constant C \u2265 1 such that\ndeg(fAk ) = C * \u03bbk1 + O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\nProof. First, given a vector v \u2208 Rn , since A is diagonalizable, we can represent v uniquely as\nv = v1 + v2 + * * * + v m ,\n\nwhere each vj \u2208 Cn is an eigenvector corresponding to \u03bbj . We have v1 \u2208 Rn\nsince \u03bb1 is real. Thus\nAk v = \u03bbk1 v1 + \u03bbk2 v2 + * * * + \u03bbkm vm .\n\nLet \u03c8 be the support function of some degree one divisor D in Pn . For each\nk, there is some maximal cone \u03c3k such that Ak v \u2208 \u03c3k . Let Lk be the linear\nfunction such that Lk |\u03c3k = \u03c8|\u03c3k . Notice that Lk can be defined on Cn as a\nlinear map, and we have\n\u03c8(Ak v) = Lk (Ak v) = Lk\n= \u03bbk1 * Lk (v1 ) +\n=\n\nLk (v1 ) * \u03bbk1\n\nm\nX\n\nj=1\nm\nX\nj=2\n\n\u03bbkj vj\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03bbkj * Lk (vj )\n\n+ O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\n\nThere are two cases here: v1 6= 0, or v1 = 0.\nFirst, if v1 6= 0, then for the rays \u03c4 = R\u22650 * v, we know Ak \u03c4 \u2192 R\u22650 * v1 .\nThus for large k, we can choose \u03c3k so that both Ak v \u2208 \u03c3k and v1 \u2208 \u03c3k .\nSince Lk |\u03c3k = \u03c8|\u03c3k for the cone \u03c3k , we know that for large k, the value\nLk (v1 ) = \u03c8(v1 ) is independent of k, and \u03c8(Ak v) = \u03c8(v1 ) * \u03bbk1 + O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\nSecond, if v1 = 0, then it is obvious that \u03c8(Ak v) = O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\n\n\f24\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nNow let's look at the fan structure of projective spaces. For the ray\ngenerators e0 , e1 , * * * , en of Pn , if ei is decomposed as\n\n(6.7)\n\nei = vi,1 + vi,2 + * * * + vi,m\n\nfor i = 0, 1, * * * , n, where each vi,j is an eigenvector corresponding to the\neigenvalue \u03bbj . Then\nIf we set\n(6.8)\n\n\u03c8(Ak ei ) = \u03c8(vi,1 ) * \u03bbk1 + O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\nC=\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212\u03c8(vi,1 ),\n\nthen we can compute the degree sequence deg(fAk ) as\ndeg(fAk ) = deg((fAk )\u2217 D)\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2212\u03c8(Ak ei )\n\n= C * \u03bbk1 + O(|\u03bb2 |k ).\n\nThe fact that C \u2265 1 is a consequence of Corollary 6.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that, on our way to prove the theorem, we also derive a concrete\nformula for the constant C in (6.8).\nTheorem 6.7. Assuming that the matrix A is diagonalizable, and there is a\nunique eigenvalue \u03bb1 of maximal modulus, which is real and negative. Also\nassume that the eigenvalues of A are arranged as (\u2212\u03bb1 ) > |\u03bb2 | \u2265 |\u03bb3 | \u2265\n* * * \u2265 |\u03bbm | for some m. Then there are two positive constants C0 , C1 , not\nnecessarily distinct, and satisfying 1 \u2264 C0 \u2264 C12 , such that\nwhere l = 0, 1.\n\ndeg(fA2k+l ) = Cl * |\u03bb1 |2k+l + O(|\u03bb2 |2k+l ),\n\nProof. We consider the subsequences {deg(fA2k )} and {deg(fA2k+1 )}. Since\nA2 satisfies the condition in Theorem 6.6, with the unique eigenvalue |\u03bb1 |2\nwith maximal modulus, thus\ndeg(fA2k ) = C0 * |\u03bb1 |2k + O(|\u03bb2 |2k )\n\nfor some C0 \u2265 1. For the subsequence {deg(fA2k+1 )}, we consider Aei instead\nof ei in (6.7) in the proof of Theorem 6.6, and apply the map fA2 on these\nvectors. We then get\ndeg(fA2k+1 ) = C1 * |\u03bb1 |2k+1 + O(|\u03bb2 |2k+1 )\n\nfor some C1 \u2265 1.\nFinally, for any k, we have,\n\n\u00012\ndeg(fA4k+2 )/|\u03bb1 |4k+2 \u2264 deg(fA2k+1 )/|\u03bb1 |2k+1 .\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n25\n\nAs k \u2192 \u221e, the left side converges to C0 , while the right side converges to\n\u0003\nC12 . So the relation C0 \u2264 C12 follows. This completes the proof.\nFrom the proof, we cannot tell if the two constants C0 and C1 are the\nsame or not. Notice that Examples 6.4 and 6.5 are both examples of the\ntheorem. However, we have C0 = C1 = 1 for Example 6.4, but C0 = 1,\nC1 = 2 for Example 6.5. This shows that both cases are possible.\nThe idea in the proof of Theorem 6.7 of considering subsequences can be\npushed further to prove the following more general result.\nTheorem 6.8. Assume that the matrix A is diagonalizable, and assume for\neach eigenvalue \u03bb of A of maximum modulus, \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is a root of unity. Then\nthere is a positive integer p, and p constants C0 , C1 , * * * , Cp\u22121 \u2265 1, such that\ndeg(fApk+l ) = Cl * |\u03bb1 |pk+l + O(|\u03bb2 |pk+l ),\n\nwhere l = 0, 1, * * * , p \u2212 1.\nProof. Notice that there is an integer p such that the eigenvalue of Ap of\nmaximum modulus is unique and positive, so we can use the same argument\nas Theorem 6.7 to the subsequences\n{deg(fApk )}, {deg(fApk+1 )}, * * * , {deg(fApk+p\u22121)}.\nThe theorem then follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nUnder the assumption of Theorem 6.8, the sequence {deg(fAk )/|\u03bb1 |k }\u221e\nk=1\nhas finitely many limit points, namely, C0 , * * * , Cp\u22121 . The following proposition shows a different behavior of the sequence {deg(fAk )/|\u03bb1 |k }\u221e\nk=1 when we\nhave a maximal eigenvalue \u03bb such that \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is not a root of unity. Therefore,\nwe cannot expect Theorem 6.8 holds for general diagonalizable matrices.\nProposition 6.9. For a 2 \u00d7 2 integer matrix A, suppose it has a conjugate\npair \u03bb, \u03bb\u0304 of eigenvalues such that \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is not a root of unity. Then the\nsequence {deg(fAk )/|\u03bb|k }\u221e\nk=1 is dense in some closed interval contained in\n[1, \u221e).\nProof. First, notice that\n(6.9)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 Ak \u0011\n\u0010\ndeg(fAk )\n\u03bd(Ak )\nk\n.\n=\n=\n\u03bd\n=\n\u03bd\n(A/|\u03bb|)\n|\u03bb|k\n|\u03bb|k\n|\u03bb|k\n\nSince \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is not a root of unity, we can conjugate A/|\u03bb| to some irrational\nrotation matrix, i.e., we can write\n\u0012\n\u0013\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nA/|\u03bb| = P *\n* P \u22121 ,\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\nfor some \u03b8 6\u2208 2\u03c0Q. Thus the closure of the set S = {(A/|\u03bb|)k |k \u2208 N} is\nn\no\n\u0001\nt \u2212 sin t * P \u22121 t \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] .\nS = P * cos\nsin t cos t\n\n\f26\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nS is, topologically, a circle inside M2 (R). Since \u03bd is continuous, \u03bd(S\u0304) =\n\u03bd(S) is connected and compact. Thus it is either a point or a closed interval.\nWe claim that \u03bd(S) cannot be a point. If \u03bd(S) = {C}, then we will\nhave deg(fAk ) = C * |\u03bb|k for all k \u2208 N. In this case, the degree sequence\ndk = deg(fAk ) satisfies a linear recurrence dk+1 = |\u03bb| * dk . This contradicts\na theorem of Bedford and Kim [1, Theorem 1.1], which asserts that if the\nmatrix A has a complex eigenvalue \u03bb of maximal modulus, and \u03bb/\u03bb\u0304 is not\na root of unity, then the degree sequence for fA cannot satisfy any linear\nrecurrence relation.\nHence, \u03bd(S\u0304) = \u03bd(S) is a closed interval. By (6.9), \u03bd(S) is exactly the set\n{deg(fAk )/|\u03bb|k ; k \u2208 N}. Finally, by Corollary 6.5, we further know that the\ninterval \u03bd(S) is contained in [1, +\u221e). This concludes the proof.\n\u0003\n6.3. Degree growth on weighted projective spaces. Weighted projective spaces are generalizations of the usual projective spaces. The results we\nobtained in the last subsection about the degree growth of monomial maps\non projective spaces can be generalized to weighted projective spaces. We\nwill explain briefly how the generalization is done in this section.\nFor arbitrary positive integers d0 , * * * , dn , the associated weighted projective space, denoted by P(d0 , * * * , dn ), is defined as\nP(d0 , * * * , dn ) = (Cn+1 \u2212 {0})/ \u223c\n\nwhere the equivalent relation is given by (x0 , * * * , xn ) \u223c (\u03b6 d0 x0 , * * * , \u03b6 dn xn )\nfor \u03b6 \u2208 C\u2217 .\nFor d = gcd(d0 , * * * , dn ), one can show that P(d0 , * * * , dn ) \u223c\n= P(d0 /d, * * * , dn /d)\n([10, Proposition 3.6 (I)]). Moreover, suppose that d0 , * * * , dn have no common factor, and that d is a common factor of all di for i 6= j (and therefore\nd is coprime to dj ). Then\n\u0010d\ndj\u22121\ndj+1\ndn \u0011\n0\n,\n,*** ,\n, dj ,\n,*** ,\nP(d0 , * * * , dn ) \u223c\n=P\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\n(see [10, Proposition 3.6 (II)]). A weighted projective space P(d0 , * * * , dn )\nsuch that no n of the d0 , d1 , * * * , dn have a common factor is called well\nformed. The above isomorphism allows us only consider the weighted projective spaces which are well formed. We will make that assumption from\nnow on. Also, for simplicity of notation, we will denote P(d0 , * * * , dn ) simply by P when there is no confusion. The usual projective space, which is\nP(1, 1, * * * , 1), will still be denoted by Pn .\nTo construct P(d0 , * * * , dn ) as a toric variety, one uses the same fan as in\nthe construction of the projective spaces. That is, the cones are generated\nby proper subsets of {e0 , * * * , en }. The lattice N \u2032 is taken to be generated\nby the vectors e\u2032i := ei /di , i = 0, * * * , n. Let \u03c4i = R\u22650 * ei be the rays for the\nfan of P, the well formed-ness of P implies that e\u2032i is the ray generator for \u03c4i\nfor i = 0, * * * , n.\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n27\n\n\u03c42\n\n\u03c41\n\n\u03c40\nFigure 3. The lattice and fan structure for P = P(1, 2, 3).\nExample 6.8. The lattice and fan structure of P(1, 2, 3) is shown in Figure 6.8. The solid black dots represent the lattice N = Z2 . The unfilled\ndots, together with the solid dots, represent the lattice N \u2032 = 12 Z \u2295 31 Z for\nP(1, 2, 3). The fan structure of P(1, 2, 3) is the same as P2 .\nIf we define the map \u03b8 : Zn+1 \u2192 N \u2032 by \u03b8(a0 , * * * , an ) = a0 e\u20320 + * * * + an e\u2032n ,\nthen \u03b8 is a surjective homomorphism, and ker(\u03b8) is the rank one subgroup\nZ * (d0 , * * * , dn ). Hence N \u2032 \u223c\n= Zn+1 /Z * (d0 , * * * , dn ), and we also obtain a\ndescription for the dual lattice as follows:\n\b\n\u223c (a0 , * * * , an ) \u2208 Zn+1 | a0 d0 + * * * + an dn = 0 .\nM \u2032 = (N \u2032 )\u2228 =\n\nRecall that the group of T -invariant Weil divisors is freely generated by\nthe orbit closures V (\u03c4i ), i.e., WDivT (P) \u223c\n= \u2295ni=0 Z*V (\u03c4i ). Define the\nPweighted\n\u2032\ndegree homomorphism deg : WDivT (P) \u2192 Z by deg\u2032 (ai *V (\u03c4i )) = ni=0 ai di .\nThe map is surjective since gcd(d0 , * * * , dn ) = 1. Moreover, it is easy to see\nthat the kernel is canonically isomorphic to M \u2032 . Therefore, the divisor class\ngroup An\u22121 (P) \u223c\n= Z, and the isomorphism is induced by the weighted degree.\nLet m = lcm(d0 , * * * , dn ), one can show that a TN -invariant Weil divisor\nD is Cartier if and only if m| deg(D). As a consequence, the image of the\nPicard group Pic(P) \u2282 An\u22121 (P) \u223c\n= Z under the isomorphism is the subgroup\nmZ.\nTherefore, after tensoring with the group of rational numbers Q, the group\nof T -invariant Q-Weil divisors is the same as that of Q-Cartier divisors,\nand the divisor class group is the same as the Picard group, both with\nQ-coefficients. Thus we will look at Q-Weil divisors and rational support\nfunction in this subsection.\nLet \u03c8 be a rational support function, then \u03c8 induces\na Q-Cartier divisor\nPn\n\u2032\non P, whose associated Q-Weil divisor is D = i=0 \u2212\u03c8(e\u2032i ) * V (\u03c4i ). Also,\n\u03c8 induces a Q-Cartier divisor on Pn , with associated Q-Weil divisor D =\nP\nn\ni=0 \u2212\u03c8(ei ) * V (\u03c4i ). A basic fact is the following.\nLemma 6.10. Assume the above notations, then the weighted degree of D \u2032\nis the same as the degree of D, i.e., deg\u2032 (D \u2032 ) = deg(D).\n\n\f28\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nProof. This can be verified as follows:\ndeg\u2032 (D \u2032 ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212di * \u03c8(e\u2032i ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212di * \u03c8(ei /di ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212\u03c8(ei ) = deg(D).\n\u0003\n\nWe can then discuss the pull back map for a toric map on a weighted\nprojective space. The pull back map on divisors can be obtained by the\nformula in Theorem 4.1. The pull back map on Picard group is given by the\naction on the degree of a divisor, which we also call it the weighted degree of\nthe map, denoted by deg\u2032 (fA ). In general, the weighted degree is a rational\nnumber, not necessarily an integer.\nMore precisely, let A \u2208 End(N \u2032 ), then A induces a toric rational map fA :\nP \u2192 P. Using the standard basis e1 , * * * , en of NR\u2032 \u223c\n= NR , we can represent\nA as an n \u00d7 n matrix with rational entries. The following proposition tells\nus how to compute the weighted degree of fA .\nProposition 6.11. Assume the above notations, then the weighted degree\nof fA is given by\ndeg\u2032 (fA ) = \u03bd(A),\nwhere \u03bd : Mn (R) \u2192 R is the function defined in (6.4).\nProof. The weighted degree can be computed as deg\u2032 (fA ) = deg(fA\u2217 D \u2032 ) for\nany Q-divisor D \u2032 on P of degree one. Thus, if D \u2032 is a Q-divisor on P of\ndegree one, and \u03c8 = \u03c8D\u2032 is the Q-support function of D \u2032 , then\ndeg\u2032 (fA ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212di * \u03c8(Ae\u2032i ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2212\u03c8(Aei ) = \u03bd(A).\n\nThe last equality holds because the degree of the Q-divisor on Pn associated\nto \u03c8 also has degree one by Lemma 6.10.\n\u0003\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 \u22123\nExample 6.9. For the matrix A = 2 02 , it does not preserve the lattice\n3\n\nZ2 , but it preserve the lattice N \u2032 = 12 Z \u2295 13 Z for P(1, 2, 3) in Example 6.8.\nIn fact, we have e\u20321 7\u2192 e\u20321 + e\u20322 and e\u20322 7\u2192 \u2212e\u20321 . Therefore, fA is a well-defined\ntoric rational map on P(1, 2, 3). The map fA has degree 13\n6 , which is not an\ninteger.\n\nSince the weighted degree function is the same as the function \u03bd, this\ntells us that the weighted degree growth of iterations of toric rational maps\non P follows the same results as the degree growth on Pn . Therefore, we\ncan conclude that all theorems and propositions in Section 6.2 also hold for\nweighted degree growth of toric rational maps on weighted projective spaces.\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n29\n\n7. Monomial maps and polynomial maps on (P1 )n\n1\nIn this section, we fix the space (P1 )n = P\n* * \u00d7 P1} , and fix the fan \u03a3\n| \u00d7 *{z\nn\n\nto be the one associated to (P1 )n , as described in Example 2.5. We set the\ncoordinate as\nn\no\n(P1 )n = ([x1 ; y1 ], * * * , [xn ; yn ]) [xi ; yi ] \u2208 P1 for i = 1, * * * , n .\n\n7.1. Pulling back divisors by monomial maps on (P1 )n . Let Di , Ei\nbe the divisors defined by the equations xi = 0, yi = 0, respectively, for\ni = 1, * * * , n. Notice that if we set \u03c4i = R\u22650 * ei , then Di = V (\u03c4i ) and\nEi = V (\u2212\u03c4i ). The group of torus invariant divisors are then generated by\nthe Di 's and Ei 's, that is,\nCDivT ((P1 )n ) \u223c\n= Z2n = ZD1 \u2295 ZE1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 ZDn \u2295 ZEn .\nNotice that the support function for Di and Ei are\n\u03c8Di (a1 , * * * , an ) = min{\u2212ai , 0},\n\u03c8Ei (a1 , * * * , an ) = min{ai , 0}.\n\nConsider the monomial map fA on (P1 )n associated to a matrix A =\n(aij ) \u2208 Mn (Z). Using Theorem 4.1 and the formula for \u03c8Di and \u03c8Ei , we\nobtain the following explicit description of the pull back fA\u2217 on the group\nCDivT ((P1 )n ). First, fix the ordered basis D1 , E1 , * * * , Dn , En . With respect\nto this basis, fA\u2217 is represented by a 2n \u00d7 2n integer matrix (\u03b1ij )i,j=1*** ,n .\nHere each \u03b1ij is a 2 \u00d7 2 block:\n!\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n|a\n|\n0\nji\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif aji \u2265 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n|aji |\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(7.1)\n\u03b1ij =\n!\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n|a\n|\n\uf8f4\nji\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif aji \u2264 0.\n\uf8f3\n|aji |\n0\nNotice that the block \u03b1ij corresponds to the entry aji , not aij . This is\nbecause when we induce the map fA from A, the matrix A acts on the\nlattice N , and we have to take its transposition t A to act on M = N \u2228 , see\nExamples 2.1 and 2.2.\nPassing to the Picard groups, Di is linearly equivalent to Ei , so\nPic((P1 )n ) \u223c\n= Zn = Z * [D1 ] \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z * [Dn ].\nThe pull-back fA\u2217 on Picard \u0001group, with respect to the basis [D1 ], * * * , [Dn ],\nis given by the matrix |aji | , i.e., each entry of fA\u2217 is the absolute value of\nthe corresponding entry of the transpose matrix t A. This observation about\nf \u2217 has an immediate application, which is shown in the next subsection.\n\n\f30\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\n7.2. The first dynamical degree of a monomial map. It is known that\nthe first dynamical degree of a monomial map fA is the spectral radius of\nthe matrix A (see [8, Theorem 6.2]). In this section we will provide an\nalternative proof of this fact.\nFor a compact K\u00e4hler manifold X, and a rational self map f : X \u2192\nX, let f \u2217 : H 1,1 (X; R) \u2192 H 1,1 (X; R) be the pull back map on the (1, 1)\ncohomology group. Put any norm k*k on the space EndR (H 1,1 (X; R)) of\nR-linear endomorphism on H 1,1 (X; R). Then the first dynamical degree of\nf , denoted by \u03b41 (f ), is defined by\n\u03b41 (f ) = lim inf k(f k )\u2217 k1/k .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nA property of the first dynamical degree is that it is invariant under birational conjugate (see [7, Proposition 2.6 and Corollaire 2.7]). Therefore, it\nis a common method to find a good birational model X\u0303 of X so that it is\neasier to compute the dynamical degree for the conjugate f \u0303 : X\u0303 \u2192 X\u0303. In\nthis section, we would like to use the model (P1 )n . With this model, we can\nobtain another proof of the following:\nTheorem 7.1. The first dynamical degree of a monomial map fA is the\nspectral radius of the matrix A.\nProof. For X = (P1 )n , we have H 1,1 (X; R) \u223c\n= Pic(X) \u0001\u2297Z R. Also, remem\u2217\nber that fA can be represented by the matrix |aji | . For a linear map\nin EndR (H 1,1 (X; R)), we first represent it by a matrix with respect to the\nordered basis [D1 ], * * * , [Dn ]. Then we take the L1 norm of the matrix representation. This gives a norm on EndR (H 1,1 (X; R)), i.e., we set\nn\nX\n\u0001\n|aji |.\nkfA\u2217 k = k |aji | k1 =\ni,j=1\n\nIt is easy to see that\n(7.2)\n\nkfA\u2217 k = kAk1 .\n\nFurthermore, for the k-th iterate of fA , we know fAk = fAk . By substituting\nA with Ak in (7.2), we also know k(fAk )\u2217 k = k(fAk )\u2217 k = kAk k1 . Therefore,\n\u03b41 (f ) = lim inf k(fAk )\u2217 k1/k\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n1/k\n\n= lim inf kAk k1\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n= \u03c1(A).\n\u0003\n7.3. Algebraic stability of monomial maps on (P1 )n . We now turn to\nthe discussion about algebraic stability. The goal of this section is to show\nthat for monomial maps on (P1 )n , being algebraic stable is equivalent to\nbeing strongly algebraic stable.\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n31\n\nLet A = (aij ), B = (bij ) be two n \u00d7 n integer matrices, and fA , fB be the\nmonomial maps on (P1 )n induced by A, B, respectively. Also, let C = AB\nbe their product, and assume that C = (cij ). Then fA \u25e6fB = fAB = fC , thus\nwe know on the Picard group, the pull back (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217P= fC\u2217 is represented\nby the matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is given by |cji | = | nk=1 ajk bki |. On the\nother hand, the (i, j)-th entry of the matrix representing fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 is\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n|bki | * |ajk | =\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n|ajk bki |.\n\nThe two numbers are equal if and only if all the non-zero summands ajk bki\nhave the same sign, i.e., they are either all positive or all negative. Thus we\nknow that (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 = fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 for divisor classes in the Picard group if and\nonly if the following condition holds:\nP\n(\u22c6) For each entry nk=1 ajk bki of the matrix AB, all the non-zero summands ajk bki have the same sign.\n\nThe situation in the group CDivT ((P1 )n ) is similar, but more complicated.\nWe know that for the fixed ordered basis D1 , E1 , * * * , Dn , En , the pull back\nmaps fA\u2217 , fB\u2217 , and (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 = fC\u2217 on CDivT (X) are represented by the\n2n \u00d7 2n integer matrices (\u03b1ij ), (\u03b2ij ), and (\u03b3ij ), respectively. Here each of\nthe \u03b1ij , \u03b2ij , and \u03b3ij is a 2 \u00d7 2 block as described in (7.1). The composition\nfB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 is then represented by the matrix product (\u03b2ij ) * (\u03b1ij ). We can do\n\u2032 ) = (\u03b2 ) * (\u03b1 ), where\nthe matrix multiplication by blocks, and assume (\u03b3ij\nij\nij\n\u2032\n\u03b3ij\n=\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u03b2ik * \u03b1kj .\n\nA simple calculation shows that\n!\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n|ajk bki |\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n|ajk bki |\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b2ik * \u03b1kj =\n!\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n|ajk bki |\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n|ajk bki |\n0\n\nif ajk bki \u2265 0,\n\nif ajk bki \u2264 0.\n\nSince the blocks \u03b3ij are either of the form ( 0l 0l ) or of the form ( 0l 0l ) for some\n\u2032 = \u03b3 is that all block\nnon-negative integer l, a necessary condition for \u03b3ij\nij\nsummands \u03b2ik * \u03b1kj are of the same form, i.e., all of the form ( 0l 0l ) or all\nof the form ( 0l 0l ). This is equivalent to the condition that all the nonzero\nterms ajk bki are of the same sign for k = 1, * * * , n. On the other hand, once\nwe have that all the nonzero terms ajk bki are of the same sign, it is easy\n\u2032 = \u03b3 . Therefore, we conclude\nto see that we will automatically have \u03b3ij\nij\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthat (fA \u25e6 fB ) = fB \u25e6 fA as maps on CDivT (X) if and only if the condition\n(\u22c6) holds again. We can summarize the above discussion as the following\nproposition.\n\n\f32\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nProposition 7.2. (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 = fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 for T -invariant divisors if and only\nif (fA \u25e6 fB )\u2217 = fB\u2217 \u25e6 fA\u2217 for divisor classes in the Picard group, if and only if\nthe condition (\u22c6) is satisfied.\n\u0003\n7.4. Stability of rational maps on (P1 )n . In the last two subsections of\nthis paper, we will leave the realm of monomial maps, and look at some\ngeneral phenomenon about algebraic stability of rational maps on (P1 )n .\nAssume that we have a rational map f : Cn 99K Cn given by\n\u0010 p (z)\npn (z) \u0011\n1\n,\n,*** ,\nf (z) = f (z1 , * * * , zn ) =\nq1 (z)\nqn (z)\n\nwhere the pj , qj are polynomials in z = (z1 , * * * , zn ) for i = 1, * * * , n. We can\nassume that pj and qj are pairwise relatively prime, otherwise we can divide\nthem by their greatest common divisor. The map f induces a rational map,\nalso denoted by f , on (P1 )n , in the following way.\nf ([x1 ; y1 ], * * * , [xn ; yn ])\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= [P1 (xi , yi ); Q1 (xi , yi )], * * * , [Pn (xi , yi ); Qn (xi , yi )] .\n\nHere the Pj and Qj are obtained by homogenizing the polynomials pj , qj in\nthe j-th component of f , with respect to every pair of variables (xi , yi ), by\nsetting zi = xi /yi . We will use P1 (xi , yi ) as a shorthand for P1 (x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn ).\nThe concrete formulae for Pj and Qj are\nPj (xi , yi ) = Pj (x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn )\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010Y\nmax{degzi (pj ),degzi (qj )}\nxn\nx1\n* pj ( , * * * , ),\nyi\n=\ny1\nyn\ni=1\n\nQj (xi , yi ) = Qj (x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn )\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010Y\nmax{degzi (pj ),degzi (qj )}\nx1\nxn\n* qj ( , * * * , ).\nyi\n=\ny1\nyn\ni=1\n\nThus the polynomials Pj and Qj are homogeneous in each pair of variables\n(xi , yi ), of the same degree = max{degzi (pj ), degzi (qj )}. We denote this\ndegree by deg(xi ,yi ) Pj = deg(xi ,yi ) Qj , and call such polynomials Pj and Qj\nmulti-homogeneous.\nConversely, given 2n multi-homogeneous polynomials Pj (xi , yi ), Qj (xi , yi ),\nj = 1, * * * , n, which are pairwise relatively prime, and satisfy deg(xi ,yi ) Pj =\ndeg(xi ,yi ) Qj for all i, j = 1, * * * , n. Then they induce a rational map f :\n(P1 )n 99K (P1 )n by sending ([x1 ; y1 ], * * * , [xn ; yn ]) to\n([P1 (xi , yi ); Q1 (xi ; yi )], * * * , [Pn (xi , yi ); Qn (xi ; yi )]).\n\nThe indeterminacy set of the rational map f is given by If = \u222anj=1 If,j , where\nIf,j is the set defined by the equations Pj = Qj = 0.\nRecall that the Picard group of (P1 )n is\nPic((P1 )n ) = Z * [D1 ] \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z * [Dn ],\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n33\n\nwhere Di is the divisor defined by xi = 0, and [Di ] is the linear equivalence\nclass of Di in Pic((P 1 )n ). Therefore, the pull back map f \u2217 : Pic((P1 )n ) \u2192\nPic((P1 )n ), with respect to the ordered basis [D1 ], * * * , [Dn ], is represented\nby the matrix\n\u0010\n\u0011\nDeg(f ) = max{degzi (pj ), degzi (qj )}\n1\u2264i\u2264n;1\u2264j\u2264n.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= deg(xi ,yi ) (Pj )\n1\u2264i\u2264n;1\u2264j\u2264n.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= deg(xi ,yi ) (Qj )\n1\u2264i\u2264n;1\u2264j\u2264n.\n\nTherefore, the condition (f \u2217 )n = (f n )\u2217 for algebraic stability can be translated into the condition Deg(f )n = Deg(f n ). We will give a geometric\ncharacterization of algebraic stable maps on (P1 )n . Before doing that, we\nneed to introduce some notations and facts about (P1 )n .\nSuppose we equip (C2 )n with the coordinate (x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn ), and let\nEj = {xj = yj = 0} \u2282 (C2 )n , then there is a quotient map\n\u03c0 : (C2 )n \\(\u222anj=1 Ej ) \u2212\u2192 (P1 )n\n\n(x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn ) 7\u2212\u2192 ([x1 ; y1 ], * * * , [xn ; yn ])\n\nFor each point x \u2208 (P1 )n , the fibre \u03c0 \u22121 (x) is an algebraic torus (C\u2217 )n .\nSuppose that a rational map f : (P1 )n 99K (P1 )n is given by Pj and Qj ,\nas described above. We can lift the rational map f to obtain a polynomial\nmap F : (C2 )n \u2192 (C2 )n . F is defined by the same polynomials Pj and Qj\nas f , i.e.,\n\u0001\nF (xi , yi ) = P1 (xi , yi ), Q1 (xi , yi ), * * * , Pn (xi , yi ), Qn (xi , yi ) .\n\nNotice that, a point x \u2208 (P1 )n is in the indeterminacy set If if and only\nif F (\u03c0 \u22121 (x)) \u2282 (\u222anj=1 Ej ). When this happens, since \u03c0 \u22121 (x) is irreducible\n(in the Zariski topology), we must have F (\u03c0 \u22121 (x)) \u2282 Ej for some j. To\nconclude, we have\nx \u2208 If \u21d0\u21d2 F (\u03c0 \u22121 (x)) \u2282 Ej for some j.\n\nA hypersurface V \u2282 (P1 )n is defined by a multi-homogeneous polynomial\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(x1 , y1 , * * * , xn , yn ) = 0. We can consider the lifting of V in (C2 )n ,\ndefined by Ve = \u03c0 \u22121 (V ). Ve is a hypersurface in (C2 )n , and the defining\nequation for Ve is also \u03c6 = 0. Notice that V is irreducible in the Zariski\ntopology on (P1 )n if and only if Ve is irreducible in the Zariski topology on\n(C2 )n . This is because if we can factor \u03c6 = \u03c61 * \u03c62 , then both \u03c61 and \u03c62\nhave to be multi-homogeneous.\nThe following proposition and theorem characterize, geometrically, the\nalgebraic stable maps on (P1 )n . The proof is a modification of the method\nused to prove a similar proposition on Pn by Fornaess and Sibony ([5], see\nalso [11, Proposition 1.4.3]). Also, the results were already given, in the more\n\n\f34\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\ngeneral context of multiprojective spaces, by Favre and Guedj [4, Proposition\n1.7]. We include them here for completeness.\nProposition 7.3. For two rational maps f, g : (P1 )n 99K (P1 )n , the relation\nDeg(f \u25e6 g) = Deg(g) * Deg(f ) holds if and only if there is no hypersurface\nV \u2282 (P1 )n such that g(V \\Ig ) \u2282 If .\nProof. First, if there is such a V , we can assume that V is irreducible. Then\nU = \u03c0 \u22121 (V \\Ig ) is a nonempty open subset of Ve , hence is dense in Ve and is\nirreducible. The condition g(V \\Ig ) \u2282 If means that for all y \u2208 U , we have\nF (G(y)) \u2208 Ej for some j. A priori the Ej may depend on y, but since U\nis irreducible, this implies that F (G(U )) \u2282 Ej for some j. Without loss of\ngenerality, assume j = 1. Furthermore, since U is open and dense in Ve , and\nE1 is a closed subset of (P1 )n , we conclude that F (G(Ve )) \u2282 E1 as well.\nSuppose V is defined by the multi-homogeneous polynomial \u03c6, and for\nx \u2208 (P1 )n , the maps f, g are given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nf (x) = [P1 (x); Q1 (x)], * * * , [Pn (x); Qn (x)] ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\ng(x) = [P1\u2032 (x); Q\u20321 (x)], * * * , [Pn\u2032 (x); Q\u2032n (x)] .\nThe j-th component of the composition map f \u25e6 g is given by the polynomials Pj\u2032\u2032 = Pj (P1\u2032 , Q\u20321 , * * * , Pn\u2032 , Q\u2032n ) and Q\u2032\u2032j = Qj (P1\u2032 , Q\u20321 , * * * , Pn\u2032 , Q\u2032n ). A\ncomputation on degree shows that\ndeg(xi ,yi ) (Pj\u2032\u2032 ) = deg(xi ,yi ) (Q\u2032\u2032j )\n=\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\ndeg(xi ,yi ) (Pk\u2032 ) * deg(xk ,yk ) (Pj ).\n\nThis is the (i, j)-th component of the product of matrices Deg(g) * Deg(f ).\nOn the other hand, F (G(Ve )) \u2282 E1 implies that \u03c6 divides both polynomials\nP1\u2032\u2032 and Q\u2032\u20321 . Thus, for some i such that deg(xi ,yi ) (\u03c6) > 0, the (i, 1)-th\ncomponent of the matrix Deg(f \u25e6 g) will be strictly less than the (i, 1)-th\ncomponent of the product of matrices Deg(g) * Deg(f ). The two matrices\ncannot be equal.\nConversely, it is easy to see that if there is no such hypersurface, then the\npolynomials Pj\u2032\u2032 and Q\u2032\u2032j will be pairwise relatively prime, with the desired\ndegrees. Hence we will have Deg(f \u25e6 g) = Deg(g) * Deg(f ).\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.4. A rational map f : (P1 )n 99K (P1 )n is algebraically stable if\nand only if there does not exist an integer k and a hypersurface V \u2282 (P1 )n\nsuch that f k (V \\If k ) \u2282 If .\nProof. This is a direct consequence of the Proposition 7.3 by using an induction argument on k and setting g = f k in the proposition.\n\u0003\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n35\n\n7.5. Stability of polynomial maps on (P1 )n . Recall that for f (z) =\n(p1 (z)/q1 (z), * * * , pn (z)/qn (z)), it induces a rational map on (P1 )n , and the\npull back f \u2217 is represented by the matrix\n\u0010\n\u0011\nDeg(f ) = max{degzi (pj ), degzi (qj )}\n1\u2264i\u2264n;1\u2264j\u2264n.\n\nIn particular, if f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) is a polynomial map, then pj = fj and\ndegzi (qj ) = 0 for all i, j, hence\n\u0011\n\u0010\nDeg(f ) = deg+\nzi (fj ) .\n\nHere deg+\nzi (fj ) = max{degzi (fj ), 0} is almost the degree of f ; the only difference is that for the zero polynomial, we have deg+\nzi (0) = 0 instead of the\nusual convention degzi (0) = \u2212\u221e.\nGiven a polynomial map f , for notational simplicity, we will denote\ndeg+\nzi (fj ) by degi (fj ) and just call it the degree of fj with respect to zi ,\nand we will call Deg(f ) the degree matrix of f .\nOur next goal is to proof the following Theorem 7.5, which gives a family\nof algebraically stable polynomial maps on (P1 )n , and a partial converse\nwhich gives a characterization for algebraically stable polynomial maps on\n(P1 )n under certain condition. First, we need to define some terminologies.\nDefinition. For a polynomial h \u2208 C[z1 , * * * , zn ] and a monomial \u03bc =\nz1a1 * * * znan , we said that \u03bc is a monomial term of h if the coefficient of \u03bc\nin h is not zero. A monomial term \u03bc of h is said to be the dominant term\nof h if for all i = 1, * * * , n, we have degi (h) = degi (\u03bc).\nEquivalently, a monomial term \u03bc = z1a1 * * * znan of h is the dominant term\nof h if and only if, for all monomial term zab1 * * * znbn of h , we have ai \u2265 bi for\ni = 1, * * * , n. For example, the polynomial h = 2z12 z2 + 3z12 + z1 z2 \u2212 5z2 \u2212 1\nhas a dominant term z12 z2 . Notice that not all polynomials have a dominant\nterm. For example, h = z1 + z2 does not have a dominant term.\nTheorem 7.5. Let f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) be a polynomial map.\n\n(1) If each fj is dominated by a monomial term, then f is algebraically\nstable on (P1 )n .\n(N )\n(N )\n(2) Assume that, for some iterate f N = (f1 , * * * , fn ) of f , we have\n(N )\ndegzi (fj ) > 0 for all i, j = 1, * * * , n. Then f being algebraically\nstable on (P1 )n implies that each fj must have a dominant term.\n\nWe will prove the theorem in steps. First, observe that, if each fj has a\na\na\ndominant term \u03bcj = z1 1j * * * znnj , then we know degi (fj ) = aij , and therefore\nDeg(f ) = (aij ).\nNext, if f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) and g = (g1 , * * * , gn ) are two polynomial maps,\na\na\nsuch that each of the fj and gk has a dominant term, say \u03bcj = z1 1j * * * znnj\nand \u03bdk = z1b1k * * * znbnk , respectively. Consider the j-th component of the\n\n\f36\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\ncomposition f g = f \u25e6 g. It will be of the following form:\n(f g)j = fj (g1 , * * * , gn )\n\n= cj * \u03bcj (\u03bd1 , * * * , \u03bdn ) + {lower order terms}\na\n\na\n\n= cj * \u03bd1 1j * * * \u03bdnnj + {lower order terms}\nn \u0010\n\u0011akj\nY\n+ {lower order terms}\n= cj *\nz1b1k * * * znbnk\nk=1\n\nwhere cj is some constant. That is, \u03bcj (\u03bd1 , * * * , \u03bdj ) is the dominant term of\n(f g)j , and the degree\ndegi ((f g)j ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nbik akj ,\n\nk=1\n\nwhich is the (i, j)-th component of the product of matrices Deg(g) * Deg(f ).\nWe summarize the above discussion as the following proposition.\nProposition 7.6. If f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) and g = (g1 , * * * , gn ) are two polynomial maps, such that each of the fj and gj has a dominant term, then the\ncomposition (f g) is also a polynomial map such that each component has a\ndominant term. Furthermore, for the degree matrix of (f g), we have\nDeg(f g) = Deg(g) * Deg(f ).\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a corollary of the proposition, we can now prove the first part of\nTheorem 7.5.\nCorollary. If f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) : Cn \u2192 Cn is a polynomial map, and if each\nfj has a dominant term, then f is algebraically stable on (P1 )n .\nProof. We know that for all k, the iterate f k is also a polynomial map such\nthat every component has a dominant term. Hence an induction argument\nshows that\nDeg(f k ) = (Deg(f ))k .\nSince the degree matrix represents f \u2217 with respect to the ordered basis\n[D1 ], * * * , [Dn ], we also have\n(f k )\u2217 = (f \u2217 )k .\n\n\u0003\nCorollary. If f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) : Cn \u2192 Cn is a polynomial map, and if each\nfj has a dominant term, then the first dynamical degree of f is an algebraic\ninteger.\nProof. We know that f is algebraically stable, and f \u2217 is represented by the\ndegree matrix Deg(f ). The first dynamical degree of f is the spectral radius\nof the degree matrix, an integer matrix. Hence the first dynamical degree is\nan algebraic integer.\n\u0003\n\n\fALGEBRAIC STABILITY AND DEGREE GROWTH\n\n37\n\nThere is a conjecture proposed by Bellon and Viallet (see [8, Conjecture\n1.1]), namely, the first dynamical degree of every rational map is an algebraic integer. The corollary shows that the conjecture holds for the case of\npolynomial maps with a dominant term for each component.\nNotice that every monomial polynomial has a dominant term, namely\nthe monomial itself. Hence we obtain another proof that every monomial\npolynomial map is algebraically stable on (P1 )n .\nNow we turn to the second part of Theorem 7.5.\nProposition 7.7. Let f1 , * * * , fn , g1 , * * * gn \u2208 C[z1 , * * * , zn ] be polynomials\nsuch that degi (gj ) > 0 for all i, j = 1, * * * , n. They induce polynomial maps\nf = (f1 , * * * , fn ) and g = (g1 , * * * , gn ) : Cn \u2192 Cn . If we have\nDeg(f g) = Deg(g) * Deg(f ),\nthen every component fj must have a dominant monomial term.\nProof. Assume otherwise, i.e., some fj does not have a dominant term, we\nwant to show the two matrices are different. Under the assumption, for\nevery monomial term \u03bc = z1a1 * * * xann , there is some ak < degk (fj ); without\nloss of generality we can assume a1 < deg1 (fj ). Consider the composition\n\u03bc \u25e6 g = \u03bc(g1 , * * * , gn ), it is easy to see that, for all i = 1, * * * , n,\ndegi (\u03bc \u25e6 g) = a1 * degi (g1 ) + * * * + an * degi (gn )\n\n< deg1 (fj ) * degi (g1 ) + * * * + degn (fj ) * degi (gn )\n\nThe inequality is strict because a1 < deg1 (fj ) and degi (g1 ) > 0. Therefore,\nwe know\ndegi (fj \u25e6 g) < deg1 (fj ) * degi (g1 ) + * * * + degn (fj ) * degi (gn ),\nNotice that the term on the left is the (i, j)-th entry of the matrix Deg(f g),\nwhereas the term on the right is the (i, j)-th entry of the matrix Deg(g) *\nDeg(f ). Hence, the two matrices are different.\n\u0003\nThe condition degi (gj ) > 0 in the proposition is essential. For example,\nlet f (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = g(z1 , z2 , z3 ) = (z2 , z3 , z1 +z2 ), then we still have Deg(f g) =\nDeg(g) * Deg(f ), but f3 = z1 + z2 does not have a dominant monomial term.\nCorollary. Suppose that f = (f1 , * * * , fn ) : Cn \u2192 Cn is a polynomial map,\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\nand for some iterate f N = (f1 , * * * , fn ) of f , we have degi (fj ) > 0 for\nall i, j = 1, * * * , n. If Deg(f k ) = Deg(f )k for all k, then every component fj\nof f must have a dominant monomial term.\nProof. Apply f and g = f N to the proposition.\nThis also concludes the proof of Theorem 7.5.\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\f38\n\nJAN-LI LIN\n\nReferences\n[1]\n\nEric Bedford and Kyounghee Kim, Linear recurrences in the degree sequences of\nmonomial mappings, Ergodic Theory Dynam.
