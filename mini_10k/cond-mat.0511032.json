The water may be sandwiched by\ntwo lipid layers, as in the black spots in soap bubbles that develop at locations where the two layers are closer than\nthe shortest wavelength of the visible spectrum and that occur just before the bubble bursts, or the water may be\noutside of the two lipid layers, as in biomembranes. While it is known that the structure of a biological membrane\nis far more complex than a simple lipid bilayer [1, 2] because of embedded proteins, cholesterol molecules, and ions,\nto name just a few of the components that provide the full functionality to this structure that is crucial to the life\nof the cell, it is nevertheless acknowledged that the lipid bilayer is the basic structural unit of all cell membranes.\nAn understanding of this simpler system is therefore extremely important in an effort to shed light on the properties\nand functioning of active transport, signaling, and adhesion in cells. Furthermore, artificial lipid bilayers are widely\nused in a number of nanotechnological applications ranging from solar energy transduction and biosensors to drug\ndevelopment.\nA lipid bilayer is highly flexible and liquid-like (as is a real membrane). It can therefore not be viewed as a static\ninert boundary but must be recognized as a dynamical structure [3]. In the case of a biological membrane, lipid\nbilayers serve as quasi-two-dimensional solvents for proteins and all other components, and are intimately involved in\nmany biochemical processes. Moreover, its ability to change its shape (curvature) is an essential property of the lipid\nbilayer since the formation of vesicles and the permeability properties of the cell depend on it.\nFrom the modeling viewpoint, it became recognized during the 90's that some internal degrees of freedom are\nnecessary to understand the large variety of conformational changes found in cell and synthetic membranes. In\nparticular, the local composition of the bilayer can crucially affect its local curvature, and some models were developed\non the basis of this idea [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, these approaches considered membranes as equilibrium systems.\nIn a biological context, this hypothesis is at best hopeful.\nNonequilibrium conditions are ubiquitous in nature, and for this reason the out-of-equilibrium behavior of membranes, both in cellular systems and in laboratory-prepared vesicles, has attracted much attention over the past few\nyears. The first successful approach to the study of nonequilibrium membranes was introduced by J. Prost et al. [10].\nRoughly summarizing their modeling approach, they suggested that some externally activated components (intramembrane proteins) act as \"pumps,\" generating forces on the membrane that locally change its curvature. Variations,\nimprovements and sequels of the initial model [11, 12, 13, 14] as well as related experimental studies [12, 15] to a\nlarge extent complete the understanding of the nonequilibrium behavior of bilayers with inserted active components.\nOur interest in this work lies in a different nonequilibrium that may arise from externally activated chemical processes involving the transformation of the elementary membrane lipid components. As an example, nice experiments\nby P. G. Petrov et al. [16] show the effect of an ongoing photocontroled chemical reaction on the curvature of synthetic\ngiant vesicles. Other evidence of chemically-induced shape transformations is found in the nervous synaptic process:\na reaction that interconverts two differently shaped constituent phospholipids of the membrane plays a crucial role in\nthe fission of vesicles in nervous cells [17, 18]. Recent experiments also point to the importance of high-curvature lipids\nin many cell processes such as membrane fusion [19]. So far, no models for this kind of nonequilibrium situation can\n\n\f2\nbe found in the literature. Our aim is to gain physical insight into the role of a generic nonequilibrium reaction acting\non a membrane that is, in turn, described through a curvature/composition coupling. We show how the reactive\nprocess endows the membrane with a rich pattern formation phenomenology and specific characteristics of its shape\nfluctuations.\nWe present a simple kinetic model of a two-component deformable bilayer with a chemical reaction. We model\nnonactive membranes where the nonequilibrium nature of the system is caused by a chemical reaction that interconverts two differently shaped components of the bilayer rather than by inserted active components. In the model,\nthe membrane is composed of two species: lipid A, which is assumed to be coned-shaped, and lipid B, which has an\ninverted cone shape (see Fig. 1). We consider the simplest scenario where the outer layer of the membrane is composed\nof A and B lipids, whereas the inner layer is composed of a single component without any curvature effect. We also\nprescribe that lipids do not move between the inner and outer layers. Both of these simplifications are made in most\nmembrane models. According to these assumptions, the membrane is simply modeled as a laterally heterogeneous\nelastic surface with an internal composition order parameter locally coupled to the curvature.\n\nFIG. 1: The two membrane components A (left) and B (right) have opposite cone shapes. We arbitrarily choose a positive\ncurvature for A and a negative one for B. A reaction interconverts both species with k+ and k\u2212 being the forward and backward\nreaction rates, respectively.\n\nWithin this framework, we are basically interested in two situations. On the one hand, for immiscible components,\nwe show that phase separation in the membrane leads to the spontaneous development of structures involving heterogeneous distributions of both composition and curvature that finally result in stationary finite-sized nonequilibrium\ndomains. This instability is studied by performing a linear stability analysis of the kinetic equations, and the patternselection role of the reactive process is established. Corresponding numerical simulations will be shown to support\nthese predictions. On the other hand, for miscible components we derive the correlation function for the membrane\nshape fluctuations. The fluctuation spectrum is mainly determined by the bending energy at small surface tension,\nand here we find the same expression for nonreactive and reactive cases, but with different bending rigidities. This\nchange in the behavior of the fluctuation spectrum between equilibrium and nonequilibrium states might be easily\ncontrolled and observed in micropipet aspiration experiments.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the study of membranes of immiscible components is addressed.\nWe propose a free energy functional, derive the kinetic equations, and perform the linear stability analysis of these\nequations. Numerical simulations are carried out and some representative results are shown. In Sec. III bilayers\nof miscible components are analyzed and the change of the height fluctuation spectrum between the reactive and\nnonreactive situations is established. We conclude with a brief summary in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nMEMBRANES OF IMMISCIBLE COMPONENTS\nA.\n\nModel and analytical results\n\nThe membrane is defined as a two dimensional surface with a concentration difference order parameter\n\u03c6 and a local\nR\n2\nextrinsic curvature H. The rigidity of the membrane leads to an elastic energy contribution \u03ba2 (H \u2212 Hsp (\u03c6)) dxdy\nto the total energy, where \u03ba is the bending rigidity modulus, and the spontaneous (equilibrium) curvature Hsp (\u03c6)\nreflects the shape asymmetry between the two lipid components. For simplicity, we adopt a linear dependence on\n\u03c6, Hsp = \u03c6H0 , with H0 > 0 according to the schematic in Fig. 1. In the Monge parametrization [20] a deformable\nsurface is described by (x, y, h(x, y)), where h(x, y) is the displacement (height) field for the local separation from the\nflat conformation. This representation is valid for surfaces that are nearly flat with only gradual variations of h, and\n\n\f3\nallows the approximation H \u2248 \u22072 h. As a function of these variables, the proposed energy functional reads\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\u03ba\n\u2212 \u03c62 + \u03c64 + |\u2207\u03c6|2 + (\u22072 h \u2212 \u03c6H0 )2 dxdy,\nF=\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first three terms correspond to the typical Ginzburg-Landau\nexpansion responsible for phase separation\n(\u03b1,\np\np\n\u03b2, \u03b3 > 0), with an equilibrium concentration difference \u03c6eq = \u00b1 \u03b1/\u03b2, and a typical interface length \u03b6 = \u03b3/\u03b1. For\nself-assembled free membranes, the surface tension contribution ( \u03c32 |\u2207h|2 ) in the free energy can be neglected, and we\nhave not included it in Eq. (1).\nThe kinetics of \u03c6 follows a conserved scheme [21] plus the reaction contributions,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202F\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 \u0393(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ),\n(2)\n= D\u22072\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\nwhere \u0393 = k+ + k\u2212 and \u03c60 = (k\u2212 \u2212 k+ )/(k+ + k\u2212 ). k+ and k\u2212 are the forward and backward reaction rate constants,\nrespectively. Considering a permeable membrane (i.e., ignoring hydrodynamic interactions) we adopt the following\nrelaxational equation for the evolution of the height field,\n\u2202h\n\u03b4F\n= \u2212\u039b\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4h\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u039b is a mobility parameter proportional to the inverse of the typical relaxation time \u03c4h .\nThe kinetic equations\ncan readily be adimensionalized: energy is measured in units of kB T , time in units of \u03c4h , and\n\u221a\nlength in units of D\u03c4h . In terms of the new dimensionless parameters, the kinetic equations become\n\u2202\u03c6\n= (\u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1)\u22072 \u03c6 + 3\u03b2\u03c62 \u22072 \u03c6 + 6\u03b2\u03c6|\u2207\u03c6|2\n\u2202t\n\u2212 \u03b3\u22074 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03baH0 \u22074 h \u2212 \u0393 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) ,\n\u2202h\n= \u2212\u03ba\u22074 h + \u03baH0 \u22072 \u03c6.\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nAt thermal equilibrium Eqs. (4) describe the spinodal decomposition of two immiscible components. Due to the\ncomposition/curvature coupling H0 , both fields will form complementary patterns. As phase segregation progresses,\nmembrane regions with positive (negative) \u03c6 deform in such a way that the curvature become positive (negative), as\nshown in Fig. 2. In the absence of reaction, this coarsening process does not end until there is complete segregation\ninto two large domains. A nonequilibrium reaction such as the one we propose converts one species into the other.\nThis amounts to a large-scale mixing mechanism that counteracts the short-scale ordering effect of phase separation.\nTherefore, the segregated structures grow only until mixing and ordering effects compensate, resulting in a stationary\npattern. These types of nonequilibrium patterns are also found in other systems such as polymer blends [22, 23] as\nwell as in monomolecular adsorbtion on metal surfaces [24, 25], and have to be distinguished from typical Turing\npatterns [26]. Even though they emerge from the same kind of instablity (see below), Turing patterns are expected in\nsystems with species with different diffusivities. In the model presented here, the domains result from the competition\nbetween a local thermodynamic affinity of equal species and a nonequilibrium reaction mixing effect. As we will see,\nlinear stability analysis and numerical simulations support this idea.\nThe stationary uniform state corresponds to \u03c6 = \u03c60 and arbitrary h. The linear stability of these uniform solutions is\ntested by adding small plane-wave perturbations of wave numer q and linearizing Eqs. (4). This procedure determines\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 linearization matrix L, with the following coefficients,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\nL11 = \u2212q 2 \u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1 + 3\u03b2\u03c620 + \u03b3q 2 \u2212 \u0393\nL12 = \u2212\u03baH0 q 4\n\nL21 = \u2212\u03baH0 q 2\n\n(5)\n\nL22 = \u2212\u03baq 4 .\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03c9q of the Jacobian associated with the matrix\n\u0010 L correspond\n\u0011to the linear growth rates of the\np\n1\nperturbations. Solving the eigenvalue problem we obtain \u03c9q = 2 T r[L] \u00b1 \u2206[L] , where \u2206[L] = T r[L]2 \u2212 4Det[L].\n\nAt the instability boundary, Re(\u03c9q ) vanishes for one finite wave number that is defined as the first unstable mode.\nIf the imaginary part of \u03c9q is not zero at this wave number, we have a wave bifurcation. The condition for this\nbifurcation is obtained by requiring T r[L] = 0 and \u2206[L] < 0. For positive \u03ba, \u0393, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, these conditions do not\napply at any real wave number, and consequently, wave instability is not found in this model.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic representation of the composition/curvature coupling effect in an unstable membrane.\n\nOn the other hand, if the imaginary part of the growth rate is zero at the bifurcation point, we have a Turing-like\nbifurcation. The condition for this bifurcation is Det[L] = 0, whose analytical expression is easily obtained, yielding\nthe following condition for the model parameters,\n\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\n\u0393 = \u0393c \u2261\n4\u03b3\n\n\u00012\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n\u0393c\n.\n\u03b3\n\n(7)\n\nand for the wave vector of the first unstable mode,\n\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\nqc2 =\n=\n2\u03b3\n\ns\n\nA phase diagram is shown in Fig. 3. In the unstable region, Turing-like patterns emerging from the competition\nbetween phase separation and reaction are predicted. In the stable phase, although the two components are not\ninherently miscible, the reaction completely mixes the system, and the bilayer becomes stable and essentially flat.\nIn the unstable phase, \u0393 < \u0393c , there is a range of unstable modes. Comparing with the equilibrium case (\u0393 = 0)\nwhere a continuous range of modes starting at q = 0 is unstable, reaction stabilizes the long wavelength modes so\nthat, as we anticipate, the long time distribution of the system results in a stationary nonequilibrium pattern with a\nfinite size (see further discussion in Sec. II B). Notice in Fig. 4 that increasing \u0393 reduces the range of unstable modes\nprogressively until \u0393 reaches the marginal value in Eq. (6), above which there is no longer any instability. The limits\nof the range of unstable modes are given by\n2\nq\u00b1\n=\n\n\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\n1\n\u00b1\n2\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n\nq\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620 )2 \u2212 4\u03b3\u0393,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich are independent of curvature parameters. Curvature reduces the unstable mode growth rates (see line with\ncircles in Fig. 4) but without changing either q\u00b1 or the marginal condition (6). The effect of curvature is exclusively\nrelated to the kinetics of the phase separation process (see below).\nBefore numerically solving the kinetic equation, we can seed light on the expected pattern formation process by\nperforming a weakly nonlinear analysis using the amplitude equations technique. This analysis allows us to compute a\nsolution for our problem near the bifurcation threshold, find the universality class of the pattern formation mechanism,\nand explain some properties such as the spatial arrangement of the patterns found in the numerical simulations.\nFor simplicity, we restrict the calculation of the amplitude equations to one spatial dimension. In spite of this\nrestriction, we will be able to predict the kind of spatial arrangement found in two dimensions by using the universality\n\n\f5\n2\n\nUnstable Regime\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b1\n\n(Stationary Nonequilibrium Patterns)\n\n1\n\nStable Regime\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u0393\n\nFIG. 3: Phase diagram for the case of immiscible components in the plane (\u03b1, \u0393) for \u03b3 = 1 and \u03c60 = 0.

Details of the derivation of the amplitude equations are presented in the\nappendix. The analysis reveals that a solution for Eqs. (4) near the bifurcation to pattern formation reads\n\u03c6 (x, t) = \u03c60 + [A exp (iqc x) + c.c.] ,\nh (x, t) = h + [B exp (iqc x) + c.c.] ,\nwhere c.c. stands for the complex conjugate, and the amplitudes A and B satisfy the equations\n#\n\"\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b2 3\u03b1 + 7\u03b2\u03c620\n3H0 \u03ba \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\nH02 \u03ba\n2\n2\n|A| + 2 \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c60 +\n\u2202t A = (\u0393c \u2212 \u0393) A 1 \u2212\n\u2202xx A +\n\u2202xx B,\n2\n2\n\u03b3\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620 )\n\u0001\n3\u03ba \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\n\u2202xx B.\n\u2202t B = H0 \u03ba\u2202xx A +\n\u03b3\n\n(9)\n\n\f6\nMoreover, since B is purely relaxational, we can adiabatically eliminate it and reduce (9) to a single evolution equation\nfor the amplitude A,\n#\n\"\n\u0001\n2\u03b2 3\u03b1 + 7\u03b2\u03c620\n2\n|A| + 4\u03b3qc2 \u2202xx A,\n\u2202t A = (\u0393c \u2212 \u0393) A 1 \u2212\n2\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620 )\n(10)\nH0\nB = \u2212 2 A.\n6qc\nTherefore, the amplitudes satisfy the real Ginzburg-Landau equation. If \u0393 > \u0393c then the amplitudes relax to zero\nand a homogeneous state (\u03c6 = \u03c60 and arbitrary h = h) is obtained. However, if \u0393 < \u0393c then the amplitudes\nreach a stationary value and a pattern develops if qc \u2208 R. Notice that the amplitudes present a negative-positive\naspect, that is, at sites where A reaches a maximum (minimum) B reaches a minimum (maximum). This is simply\na consequence of the particular selection of sign for the spontaneous curvature H0 . With regard to the nonlinear\nterm, A |A|2 , note first that its coefficient is always negative. As a result, the nonlinearity always plays a stabilizing\nrole, the bifurcation to pattern formation is supercritical for all values of the parameters, and no hysteresis may\noccur. Secondly, the nonlinear term provides information about the relevant modal interactions. At this point, we\ncan take advantage of the universality properties of the amplitude equations to infer the spatial arrangement of the\npattern in two dimensions. Since the Swift-Hohenberg model also shares the same universality class when performing\nan amplitude equation analysis, namely, it also reduces to the real Ginzburg-Landau equation [28, 29], the pattern\nformation mechanism is the same in both models. It is well-known in that case that the modal interactions in two\ndimensions are such that if the inversion symmetry is preserved then roll-like patterns develop. On the other hand,\nif that symmetry is not fulfilled, a hexagonal structure appears. Note that in Eqs. (4) the inversion symmetry,\n{\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6, h \u2192 \u2212h} is only satisfied if \u03c60 = 0. Thus we expect a roll-like pattern in that case, while hexagons will\ndevelop otherwise.\nB.\n\nNumerical results\n\nNumerical integration of Eqs. (4) has been performed in two dimensions using an explicit Euler scheme in a square\nlattice with periodic boundary condition. Small random perturbations around \u03c6 = \u03c60 and h = 0 are implemented\nas initial conditions. The coordinate step \u2206x was chosen equal to 1, and the time step was usually \u2206t = 10\u22124 to\nassure good numerical accuracy (length and time in dimensionless simulation units). The numerical results presented\nin this section correspond to highly immiscible components (deep quench, \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 1, leading to an equilibrium\nvalue of \u03c6eq = \u00b11), and an interface thickness of the order of the space discretization (\u03b6 = 1, which leads to \u03b3 = 1).\nThe bending rigidity modulus is taken equal to 10 (in units of kB T ) [27], and we consider two constituent lipids of\nvery different shapes by setting H0 = 0.2. All our numerical results are consistent with the predictions of the linear\nstability analysis and the amplitude equations. Representative numerical results are presented below.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the simulation results for three different situations. The first row corresponds to small \u0393 = 0.05\nand a critical quench (\u03c60 = 0), showing the development of a laberynthine pattern that is still evolving at t = 2000\n(the longest time for the snapshots shown in the figure). The coarsening process, however, is progressively slowed\ndown later on. The \u03c6-field profiles of these domains (horizontal cross-sectional cuts through the pattern) reveal regions\nwhere \u03c6eq is +1 or \u22121 connected by abrupt boundaries that indicate the short spatial range over which the equilibrium\norder parameter changes from one value to the other. This is a signature of the fact that the phase separation process\nis dominant for this value of \u0393. The second and third sets of panels correspond to large \u0393 = 0.2 (the marginal condition\nfor the selected parameters is \u0393c = 0.25) showing laberynthine (critical quench in the second row) and quasi-hexatic\ndroplet-like (off critical quench, \u03c60 = 0.1, in the third set) patterns. A spatial Fourier transform of this stationary\npattern shows a clear hexagonal structure. These domains are already stationary at times longer than t = 2000, and\ncan indeed be considered as nonequilibrium stable phases of the system, involving both composition and curvature\nmodulations. Their \u03c6- and h-field profiles have a smooth harmonic shape due to the strength of the reactive process.\nIn both cases, since we are close to the bifurcation boundary, small local deviations from the stationary values are\nobtained. We especially monitor the variations of the height field and find that h|\u2207h|i < 0.05 is satisfied, so that the\nmodel has a real physical correspondence.\nIn order to assess the kinetic ordering process more quantitatively, we monitor the domain size L(t) computed from\nthe composition correlation functions h\u03c6(r\u2032 , t)\u03c6(r\u2032 + r, t)i (the same results are obtained using the height correlation\nfunctions). Here, the brackets h* * * i indicate not only an average over orientations of r and over surface positions\nr\u2032 , but also over different realizations of random initial conditions. As has been reported in other studies, curvature\nconsiderably slows down the coarsening segregation process. This is specially evident when reaction is absent, and for\nthis situation different kinetic approaches have been invoked. A mean-field kinetic scheme by Taniguchi [7] leads to\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: Three sets of selected patterns resulting from the numerical simulation based on Eqs. (4). First row: \u0393 = 0.05, \u03c60 = 0.\nSecond row: \u0393 = 0.2, \u03c60 = 0. Third row: \u0393 = 0.2, \u03c60 = 0.1 (off critical quench), showing an array of droplet-like domains\nrich in the minority species. The first three panels in each row correspond to the \u03c6-field distributions of a 128 \u00d7 128 system\nat t = 100, 400 and 2000 (from left to right). Darker (lighter) regions are richer in the A (B) lipid. In the last panel of each\nrow the height field has been plotted in three dimensions for a 64 \u00d7 64 portion of the corresponding system at t = 2000. Some\nexaggeration along the vertical direction has been applied.\n\nextremely slow laberynthine stripe growth obeying L(t) \u223c tr with r = 0.1, instead of the usual spinodal decomposition\ngrowth exponent of 1/3 [30]. Later, Monte Carlo simulations [8, 9] showed how, in the long time evolution, those\nstripes break up into disconnected buds that subsequently diffuse and coalesce. In our model, when the reactive term\nis removed, similar results as those presented in Ref. [7] are obtained, and no stripe breakup is observed. The reason\nfor the disagreement between the analytic and Monte Carlo schemes is probably due to the fact that continuum\nmodels subjected to a specific parametrization of the surface such as given in Eqs. (4) do not allow for overhangs that\nare surely crucial in the late stages of membrane phase segregation.\nHowever, the cases in which there is no reaction or in which the reaction is weak are not of interest for us, since in\nthese cases the system evolves in such away that large gradients of the height displacement field occur. As noted above,\nwhen this happens the Monge surface parametrization is not valid and the model, although mathematically robust,\n\n\f8\ndoes not describe the physical behavior of any real system. In the reactive cases, however, the slow kinetics is still\nobserved for the times prior to stationary pattern formation. This is observed in Fig. 6, where a set of curves showing\nthe domain size L(t) is presented for several values of \u0393. The situations with and without curvature are compared for\neach case. Notice how the deformable systems evolve more slowly than the nondeformable ones, although the same\nfinal stationary size is achieved. There is no theory to explain such a slowing down effect, but some hand-waving\narguments may explain the physical reasons for this behavior. Monitoring of the different energy contributions in\nEq. (1) indicates that at early times (when the kinetics with and without curvature are still quite similar) interfacial\nenergy due to the rapid formation of composition domains is much larger than any other energy contribution. In\nother words, phase separation proceeds and membrane curvature follows the composition change. At this stage the\nreduction of the interfacial energy governs the coarsening process, leading to the 1/3 Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent. Later,\nat intermediate times, when composition domains become larger, the height order parameter is no longer able to keep\nup with the phase separation process and some curvature energy is stored, causing the whole coarsening process to\nslow down.\n1.5\n\u0393=0.02\n\u0393=0.05\n\u0393=0.2\n\nlog(L(t))\n\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nlog(t)\nFIG. 6: Log-log plots of L(t) vs t for different values of \u0393. The values of L(t) have been computed as an average over 10 runs\nof the correlation functions in 128 \u00d7 128 systems. In all cases \u03c60 = 0. The curvature parameters are set to \u03ba = 10, H0 = 0.2\nfor the thin lines, and \u03ba = H0 = 0 for the thicker lines.\n\nThe final size of the nonequilibrium stationary domains, Lf = L(t \u2192 \u221e), is determined by the reaction parameter.\nThe dependence of the final pattern size on the reaction parameter, Lf \u223c \u0393\u2212s , has been largely discussed in the\nliterature [22, 31, 32]. The results of our model also reproduce the two limiting behaviors: s = 1/4 for large \u0393 (close\nto its marginal value), and s = 1/3 for small \u0393. In Fig. 7, Lf is plotted for different values of the reaction parameter.\nLinear fits for the four first and the last four data points give the slopes 0.323 \u00b1 0.006 and 0.26 \u00b1 0.006, respectively.\nThe derivation of the exponent values for the rigid situation (nondeformable surfaces) is performed by minimizing an\neffective free energy expression (where the reactive term is included via Green's functions) in a square (small \u0393) and a\nharmonic (large \u0393) approximation for the stationary concentration field [31, 32]. In the present model, the curvature\nkinetics relaxationally follows the concentration dynamics. At longer times (when the stationary patterns are already\nachieved) no significant curvature energy is present in the system, so that we can neglect the curvature contributions\nin Eq. (1) and the results in Refs. [31, 32] are recovered.\nIn Eq. (3) we ignored the hydrodynamic effects due to the background fluid velocity by considering a permeable\nmembrane through which the fluid drains freely as the system evolves. Solvent hydrodynamic effects [33] can be\napproached through a renormalized height mobility \u039b = (4\u03bcq)\u22121 in the second of Eqs. (4) in Fourier space, where \u03bc\nis the solvent kinematic viscosity. The inclusion of this q-dependent mobility does not change the main results of the\nstability analysis and numerical simulations shown so far.\nBefore ending this section, we check the applicability of our results to real membrane systems. We adimensionalized\nthe kinetic equations to units in which D = \u039b = kB T = 1. Redimensionalizing them, taking the typical values\nD = 10\u22127 \u2212 10\u22128 cm2 /s (for lipids in a liquid-phase membrane), \u03bc = 1cp (H2 O at 20\u25e6 C) and the typical unstable\nmodes q \u2248 qc = 0.5, we find that the size of the patterns obtained above lies within the range 2 \u2212 20\u03bcm, which is\naccessible in giant vesicle (10 \u2212 100\u03bcm in diameter) experiments.\n\n\f9\n2.2\n2\n\nlog(Lf)\n\n1.8\n\u22121/3\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\u22121/4\n\n1\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\nlog(\u0393)\nFIG. 7: Log-log plot of Lf vs. \u0393.

All the points have been calculated for \u03c60 = 0, \u03ba = 10 and H0 = 0.2, at sufficiently long times to consider the\ngrowth process practically halted. We have performed an average over 10 realizations. The system sizes are 128 \u00d7 128 for large\n\u0393, and 256 \u00d7 256 for small \u0393.\n\nIII.\n\nMEMBRANES OF MISCIBLE COMPONENTS: LINEARIZATION AND SHAPE FLUCTUATIONS\n\nIn this section we consider a parameter region where the membrane is thermodinamically stable. The instability in\nthe previous section was caused by the immiscibility of the two lipid components, while we now consider the case of\nmiscible membrane constituents. Notice that the two situations could correspond to the same physical system but at\ndifferent temperatures, below (unstable) or above (stable) the critical temperature. For the stable case we adopt the\nfollowing free energy functional,\nZ h\ni\n\u03b1\n\u03ba\n\u03c3\n2\n\u2212 \u03c62 + (\u22072 h \u2212 \u03c6H0 )2 + (|\u2207h|) dxdy,\nF=\n(11)\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere \u03b1 is now negative, and the nonlinear (\u03b2) and line tension (\u03b3) terms have been removed since they are irrelevant\nin the absence of phase segregation. An additional surface tension term has been included in order to study membranes\nunder tension.\nIn the equilibrium situation (no reaction), the concentration field can be integrated out ( \u2202F\n\u2202\u03c6 = 0) from Eq. (11),\n\u03baH0\n2\nleading to \u03c6eq = \u03baH 2 \u2212\u03b1 \u2207 h. Inserting \u03c6eq in Eq. (11) we obtain an effective free energy for h alone,\n0\n\nFef f =\n\nZ h\ni\n\u03baef f 2 2 \u03c3\n2\n(\u2207 h) + (|\u2207h|) dxdy,\n2\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwith an effective rigidity modulus [34]\n\u03baef f\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n=\u03ba 1\u2212\n\n\u03baH02\n\u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nNotice that, as a consequence of the composition/curvature coupling, the different preferred curvature of the lipid\ncomponents acts to reduce the rigidity modulus from \u03ba to \u03baef f . Note also that \u03baef f > 0 for negative values of \u03b1, so\nthat the stability of the membrane is assured above the critical temperature.\nThe dynamics for the immiscibility situation has so far been considered to be strictly deterministic. Here, however,\nin order to obtain dynamical steady state functions, we add stochastic forces to the kinetic equations and perform an\naverage over an appropriate ensemble. The dimensionless kinetic equation for \u03c6, once the reactive terms are included,\nreads\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202\u03c6\n2 \u2202F\n\u2212 \u0393(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) + \u2207 * f\u03c6 ,\n(14)\n=\u2207\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n\f10\nwhere the last term corresponds to a conserving Gaussian noise with correlations hf\u03c6 (r, t)f\u03c6 (r\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2kB T \u03b4(r \u2212\nr\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).

(20) in the long-wavelength limit for a tensionless membrane\nleads to h|hq |2 i = kB T /\u03baef f q 4 . This behavior is truncated and replaced by kB T /\u03c3q 2 for a membrane under tension if\nonly the dominant terms at small q are retained. Keeping the dominant and the first subdominant terms, one recovers\nthe well known expression for the height variance in an equilibrium membrane,\nh|hq |2 i =\n\nkB T\n.\n\u03c3q 2 + \u03baef f q 4\n\n(23)\n\n\f11\nNotice that this result is obtained in a much simpler way from an equilibrium average using the effective free energy\nin Eq. (12).\nOne of the usual experiments to study equilibrium membrane shape fluctuations is based on the micropipet aspiration technique [35]. In these experiments, a pressure difference is applied inside a micropipet in contact with a\nvesicle membrane. This creates a tension in the membrane that pulls the excess area \u2206S due to the thermal shape\nfluctuations inside the micropipet. By means of this technique, the areal strain \u1fb1 \u2261 \u2206S/S is obtained experimentally\nfor different values of the applied tension \u03c3. According to Eq. (23), the relative areal strain \u2206\u1fb1 \u2261 \u1fb1 \u2212 \u1fb10 (\u1fb10 being\nthe areal strain for a reference value \u03c30 ) can be calculated analytically [36, 37]:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c3\nkB T\n.\n(24)\nln\n\u2206\u1fb1 =\n8\u03c0\u03baef f\n\u03c30\nTherefore, the slope of the logarithm of \u03c3 versus \u2206\u1fb1 obtained by the micropipet technique yields a measure of the\neffective bending modulus. Note that in these experiments a certain tension \u03c3 is needed, but it has to be small since\notherwise the \u03baef f q 4 term in Eq. (23) would be insignificant compared to \u03c3q 2 .\nNow the question is, how is the shape fluctuation spectrum affected by the presence of the reaction? In other\nwords, how would the nonequilibrium membranes described here behave in micropipet experiments? To answer this,\nwe evaluate Eq. (20) for \u0393 6= 0 and keep only the dominant terms in the limit q \u2192 0. For tensionless membranes we\nget h|hq |2 i = kB T /\u03baq 4 and for membranes under tension we recover h|hq |2 i = kB T /\u03c3q 2 . Keeping the dominant terms\nfor both limits, in the weak tension regime the fluctuation spectrum reads\nh|hq |2 i =\n\nkB T\n.\n\u03c3q 2 + \u03baq 4\n\n(25)\n\nComparing this result with the fluctuation spectrum obtained for membranes with active proteins [12, 13, 15], no\nnovel nonequilibrium contribution to the height fluctuations is found here. The effect of the nonequilibrium reaction\nin stable membranes results in a change between a regime governed by \u03baef f to another one with the actual rigidity\n\u03ba. Thus, the reaction makes the membrane more rigid by simply removing the composition/curvature coupling effect\nthat diminished the rigidity in the equilibrium situation. This change is more evident when the two components of\nthe bilayer are rather different in shape and miscible but close to the critical temperature. In this situation (large H0\nand \u1fb1 . 0) the difference between \u03ba and \u03baef f might be experimentally observable.\nSome caution, however, must be observed when deriving Eq. (25). In order to \u0001evaluate Eq. (20) for small q, we\nconsidered the terms \u03932 to be dominant with respect to the terms 2\u0393\n\u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1 q 2 (subdominant) and also with\n\u0001\u0001\nrespect to the subsubdominant quartic contributions \u03c3 + \u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1 q 4 (which are those that led to Eq. (23)).\nHowever, the analysis becomes more difficult if one notices that we are not in the region of asymptotically small\nwavenumbers since the smallest q accessible to an experiment is of order 1/L, where L is the linear system size. Thus,\none must look in detail at the values of the parameters in order to determine exactly which terms initially\u0001 considered\n2\nsubdominant might indeed be dominant when the reaction is present. \u03932 is dominant if \u0393 > 2 \u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1 qmin\n, with\nqmin \u223c 1/L and thus dependent on the system size. We know that for a sufficiently strong reactive process, \u03932\ndominates and\n\u0001 Eq. (25) holds, but for intermediate values of \u0393 the spectrum could change significatively. When\n\u0013\n2\u0393 \u03baH02 \u2212 \u03b1 q 2 becomes dominant, h|hq |2 i = \u0012 q kB T\nfor a tensionless membrane. These regimes are\n\u0393\u03ba/ 8\u0393(\u03baH02 \u2212\u03b1) q3\n\ncaptured in Fig. 8, where a set of h|hq |2 i curves is plotted for \u03c3 = 0. Very large and zero values for \u0393 show the q \u22124\nbehavior, although with different rigidity factors (\u03ba and \u03baef f , respectively). At intermediate \u0393, the q \u22123 behavior\nappears as predicted above.\nThe inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions can again be accomplished by considering \u039b = (4\u03bcq)\u22121 in the Fourier\ntransform of Eq. (15). This modifies the coefficients a21 and a22 in Eq. (18), which are now divided by (4\u03bcq).\n\u2032\n\u2032\nBT\nAccordingly, the fh thermal noise correlations also change to hfh (r, t)fh (r\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2k\n(4\u03bcq) \u03b4(r \u2212 r )\u03b4(t \u2212 t ), and therefore\nthe parameter A\u2032 in Eq. (22) has to be divided by (4\u03bcq) as well. However, with these modifications the evaluation of\nh|hq |2 i again leads to the results in Eqs. (23) and (25).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nStarting with a simple model of a deformable reactive membrane composed of two differently shaped molecules, we\nshow that stationary finite-sized patterns may appear under some parameter conditions for the immiscibility situation\nas a result of the competition between phase segregation and reaction.

The slopes \u22121/4 and \u22121/3 are plotted to identify the different\nregimes.\n\nvalues of the viscosity of water and lipid lateral diffusion constants in bilayers, and at normal room temperatures,\nsuch patterns are predicted to have a size of a few microns (see the discussion at the end of Sec. II B). Therefore,\nthis behavior would correspond to a reliable pattern formation mechanism in lipid membranes which we believe to\nbe experimentally accessible in giant synthetic vesicles. The amplitude of these patterns is modulated by the bilayer rigidity and the spontaneous curvature of its components. In our numerical calculations we have used realistic\ntypical values for the rigidity, while the spontaneous curvature depends on the specific geometry of the membrane\nconstituents. We specifically propose that azobenzene compounds, which are known to show amphiphilic behavior\nin Langmuir monolayers, and whose shapes are strongly modified by means of well-known photoisomerization reactions [38, 39], might be suitable to test our predictions. The selection of the applied light wavelength and its intensity\nmay determine both the fraction of the two isomers (\u03c60 ) and the strength of the reactive process (\u0393), respectively.\nThus, experimental work on synthetic vesicle membranes made of these compounds can be specifically designed to\nconfirm the results of this model.\nIn the same context, for miscible components membranes we have found a difference between the equilibrium\nand nonequilibrium situations. The effects of the composition/curvature coupling and the reactive process on the\nmembrane rigidity are established. Micropipet experiments with the proposed membrane systems might confirm\nthese results.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Ajuts Gaspar de P ortol\u00e0 program from DURSI (Generalitat de Catalunya).

(A1) some notation changes and definitions with respect to the ones\nthat appear in Eqs. (4). Thus, in Eqs. (A1) subscripts indicate partial derivatives, the field \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 has been\ndefined, and we have introduced the control parameter \u03b5 = (\u0393c \u2212 \u0393) /\u0393c that accounts for the \"distance\" to the\nbifurcation between a homogenous state (\u03b5 < 0) and pattern formation (\u03b5 > 0). The homogeneous state according to\nthis definitions corresponds to \u03c6 = 0 and arbitrary h = h.\nAs shown in Sec. (II A), by linearizing Eqs. (A1) one can easily check that if \u03b5 > 0 then the homogeneous state\nbecomes unstable and,\n\u03c6 (x) = A exp (iqc x) + A\u2217 exp (\u2212iqc x) ,\n(A2)\nh (x) = B exp (iqc x) + B \u2217 exp (\u2212iqc x) ,\n\u0001\nis a solution in the steady state if qc2 = \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620 / (2\u03b3). It is worth noting that in Eqs. (A2) we have arbitrarily\ntaken h = 0 without any loss of generality. Moreover, by substituting (A2) into (A1) and\u221aexpanding up to the first\nharmonic, O (exp (iqc x)), one finds that the amplitudes scale as a function of \u03b5 as A, B \u223c \u03b5. Thus, we expect that\nnear the bifurcation the following expansion holds,\n\u03c6=\nh=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b5n/2 \u03c6(n) ,\n(A3)\n\u03b5\n\nn/2 (n)\n\nh\n\n.\n\nn=1\n\nBy computing the linear growth rate, \u03c9q , that is, the largest eigenvalue of the linear problem (see Eqs. (5)), we\nalso note that,\n2\n\n\u03c9q |q\u2192qc \u2243 C1 \u03b5 + C2 (q \u2212 qc ) ,\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nwhere Ci are constants. Thus, as a function of \u03b5 the width of the band of unstable modes scales as \u223c \u03b51/2 . Then, since\nall modes exp (iqx) can be written as exp (i (q \u2212 qc ) x) exp (\u2212iqc x), a separation of spatial scales can be performed\nbetween the most unstable mode (fast) and the rest of the modes of the unstable band (slow). Let us call the slow\nmodulation spatial scale X, such that X = \u03b51/2 x, where x will now stand for the fast spatial scale. We also note that\nexp (\u03c9q t)|q\u2192qc \u2243 exp (\u03b5t) .\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nTherefore we can define a slow time scale as a function of the control parameter, T = \u03b5t. The separation of scales can\nbe implemented in Eqs. (A1) by replacing the spatial and temporal derivatives according to the chain rule such that\n\u2202x \u2192 \u2202x + \u03b51/2 \u2202X and \u2202t \u2192 \u03b5\u2202T .\nBy implementing the separation of scales and substituting Eqs. (A3)\n\u0001 into Eqs. (A1) we obtain a rather cumbersome\nexpansion in terms of \u03b5.

The subsequent orders are no\nlonger homogeneous and therefore their solvability can not be ensured unless one implements the so-called Fredholm\nalternative theorem [28]. In our case the application of the theorem simply states, as a recipe, that for Eqs. (A5)\nto have a solution the functions \u03c8n can not contain the fundamental mode exp (\u00b1iqc x).

However, at order \u03b53/2 the application of\nthe Fredholm theorem provides the conditions that determine the values of the amplitudes A, B. These conditions\nconstitute the amplitude equations for our pattern forming system,\n\u00012\n\u0001\n\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\n3\u03b1 + 7\u03b2\u03c620\n2\n\u2202T A =\nA\u2212\u03b2\nA |A| +\n4\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n\u0001\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3H0 \u03ba \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\nH 2\u03ba\n+ 2 \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620 + 0\n\u2202XX A +\n\u2202XX B,\n(A7)\n2\n\u03b3\n\u0001\n3\u03ba \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c620\n\u2202XX B.\n\u2202T B = H0 \u03ba\u2202XX A +\n\u03b3\n\n\f15\nEquations (A7) can be rewritten in terms of x and t to readily obtain Eqs.
