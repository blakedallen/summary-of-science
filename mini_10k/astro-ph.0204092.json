Intermittent behavior is essential for understanding the statistics and dynamics of\ncosmic gravitational clustering in the nonlinear regime. The most effective method of describing\nintermittency uses the structure functions and the intermittent exponent, which measure the\nscale- and order-dependencies of the ratio between the higher order to second order moments of\nthe field. These properties can be used not only to confirm the non-gaussianity of fields, but also\nto detect the type of non-gaussianity.\nIn this paper, we calculate the structure function and intermittent exponent of 1.) Keck\ndata, which consists of 28 high resolution, high signal to noise ratio (S/N) QSO Ly\u03b1 absorption\nspectra, and 2.) Ly\u03b1 forest simulation samples produced via the pseudo hydro scheme for the\nlow density cold dark matter (LCDM) model and warm dark matter (WDM) model with particle\nmass mW = 300, 600, 800 and 1000 eV. Aside from the WDM model with mW = 300 eV, the\nsimulation samples are in agreement with observations in the context of the power spectrum.\nWe find, however, that the intermittent behavior of all the simulation samples is substantially\ninconsistent, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with the Keck data. Specifically, 1.) the\nstructure functions of the simulation samples are significantly larger than that of Keck data on\nscales k \u2265 0.1 km\u22121 s, 2.) the intermittent exponent of the simulation samples is more negative\nthan that of Keck data on all redshifts considered, 3.) the order-dependence of the structure\nfunctions of simulation samples are closer to the intermittency of hierarchical clustering on all\nscales, while the Keck data are closer to a lognormal field on small scales. These differences\nare independent of noise and show that the intermittent evolution modeled by the pseudo-hydro\nsimulation is substantially different from observations, even though they are in good agreement\nwith each other in terms of second and lower order statistics. This result also shows that \"weakly\"\nclustered samples, like high resolution Ly\u03b1 absorption spectrum, are effective in testing dynamical\nmodels of structure formation if their intermittent features are considered.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory - large-scale structure of the universe\n\n1.\n1 Department\n\nof Physics, DePaul University, Chicago Il,\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe non-gaussian features of the QSO's Ly\u03b1\ntransmitted flux were recently studied and showed\nthat the cosmic mass field traced by the QSO's\nLy\u03b1 forests is intermittent on small scales.

The spatial distribution of the\npower of the transmission fluctuations was found\nto be spiky, i.e., the power was concentrated in\nrare modes while most modes showed very low\npower (Jamkhedkar, Zhan and Fang 2000; Zhan,\nJamkhedkar and Fang 2001; Feng, Pando and\nFang 2001).\nThe impact of intermittency on observational\ncosmology is that the power spectrum is no longer\neffective for testing models when intermittency is\nsubstantial. Although spikes in the intermittent\nfield are rare and improbable events, one cannot\nneglect the spikes in measuring the power spectrum as almost all power of the transmission fluctuations is concentrated in these events. In such a\ncase, the power spectrum is dominated by rare and\nimprobable events (spikes). An intermittent field\nis statistically homogeneous. Yet, the rare events\nlead to significant differences among samples from\ndifferent parts of the universe when the spatial size\nof the region is not large enough to contain numerous spikes. The precision of determining the\npower spectra is intrinsically constrained by intermittency. The uncertainty of the power spectrum for an intermittent field is inevitably large\n(Jamkhedkar et al 2002, hereafter Paper I).\nTherefore, in the nonlinear regime, more effective measures to compare the predictions of\nmodels and observations must be used. Although\nan intermittent field is non-gaussian, many nongaussian statistics are ineffective or insensitive to\nintermittency. This is because we need not only\ntechniques for confirming the non-gaussianity of a\nfield, but also methods which can tell the type of\nnon-gaussianity. The most effective measures sensitive to the type of intermittency are the structure functions and the intermittent exponent (e.g.\nShraiman & Siggia 2000).\nIn this paper, using a set of 28 high resolution, high signal to noise ratio (S/N) QSO Ly\u03b1\nabsorption spectra (Keck data), we will carry out a\nsystematic investigation of the structure functions\nand the intermittent exponent of the transmitted\nflux. To show the usefulness of the structure function and intermittent exponent as model discriminators, we also study the intermittent behaviors\nof Ly\u03b1 forest samples produced by a pseudo-hydro\nsimulation technique for the LCDM and WDM\nmodels. These models are among the best that\n\nmatch the observed power spectrum and other\nlower than second order statistics. We will show\nthat the simulation samples are significantly intermittent. However, both the quantitative and qualitative properties of simulation samples are found\nto be substantially different from the Keck data.\nThe paper is organized as follows. \u00a72 addresses\nthe method for measuring intermittent random\nfields. \u00a73 presents the algorithm for calculating the\nstructure functions and intermittent exponent. \u00a74\ndescribes, both the observed and simulated samples, that we will use. The power spectrum and\nother lower order statistics of the Keck data and\nsimulation samples are given in \u00a75. \u00a76 contains\nthe important result, the structure function, intermittent exponent and their of order-, redshiftand scale-dependencies for the Keck data and simulation samples. The emphasis is on revealing the\ndeviation of the intermittent behavior for the simulation samples from the Keck data. Finally, the\nconclusions and discussions are in \u00a77.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nStatistical description of an intermittent random field\nBasic properties of an intermittent\nfield\n\nPhysically, intermittency is used to characterize a special type of random field in which structures are essentially strong enhancements, peaks\nor spikes, randomly and widely scattered in space\nand/or time, with a low field value between the\nspikes. The spike-gap-spike feature is more pronounced on smaller scales. That is, compared with\ngaussian fields, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the fluctuations possesses a high\npeak around zero and possibly a long-tail. The\nlong-tail events correspond to the rare and improbable high peaks. This feature was originally\nfound in the temperature and velocity distributions in turbulence (Batchelor & Townsend 1949).\nMathematically, an intermittent random density field \u03c1(x) is defined by the ratio between the\nhigh- and low-order moments of the field\nD r E\u03b6(n)\nh[\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)]2n i\n,\n(1)\n\u224d\n2\nn\n[h[\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)] i]\nL\nwhere L is the size of the sample, and the exponent\n\u03b6 can be function of n and r. If \u03b6 is negative for\nsmall r, the ratio eq.(1) is divergent with r \u2192\n\n2\n\n\f0. This corresponds to an intermittent field. An\nintermittent field is characterized by the n- and\nr-dependencies of exponent \u03b6.\nThese properties make characterizing intermittent fields by traditional statistical measures difficult. The power spectrum and two-point correlation function are unable to quantify intermittency.\nTwo fields having the same power spectrum may\nhave very different tails in their PDF. Very different from the linear regime, the power spectrum\nwill on longer be a critical discriminator among\nmodels of structure formation for an intermittent\nfield.\nEqually ineffective are any individual higher\norder correlation functions and higher order moments of the density fluctuations \u03b4(x) = [\u03c1(x) \u2212\n\u03c1\u0304]/\u03c1\u0304. Three- and four-point correlation functions\nof the density perturbation \u03b4(x) are very useful\nfor distinguishing a gaussian from a non-gaussian\nfield. However, they are insensitive to the difference between an intermittent field and a nongaussian, but non-intermittent field. Moreover,\neq.(1) means that the PDF of the density fluctuations [\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)] cannot be expanded\ninto a series of moments of [\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)],\nas it does not converge. In this case, a better measure is not the divergent quantity itself,\nh[\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)]2n i/h[\u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x)]2 in when\nr \u2192 0, but the quantity describing the divergent\nbehavior, specifically, the exponent \u03b6.\n2.2.\n\nthe \"fair sample hypothesis\" is applicable (Peebles\n1980), the structure function can be calculated as\nthe spatial average\nZ\n1\n2n\nSr =\n|\u2206r (x)|2n dx,\n(3)\nL\nwhere L is the spatial range of the sample. When\nn = 1, we have\nSr2 = h|\u2206r (x)|2 i.\n\n(4)\n\nSr2 is the mean of the square of the density fluctuations at wavenumber k \u2243 2\u03c0/r, and therefore, the\nr-dependence of Sr2 actually is a different version\nof the ordinary power spectrum of the field.\nThe intermittent exponent \u03b6 is defined by7\n\u0010 r \u0011\u03b6\nSr2n\n.\n\u221d\n2\nn\n[Sr ]\nL\n\n(5)\n\nThe intermittency of the field is effectively measured by the structure function and the intermittent exponent.\nFor an intermittent field, the ratio of Sr2n to\n2 n\n[Sr ] is larger for smaller r, and therefore, the exponent \u03b6 is negative. The condition Sr2n \u226b [Sr2 ]n\non small scales r \u226a L indicates that the field contains \"abnormal\" events of large density fluctuations |\u2206r (x)| on scale r. Thus, the more negative\nthe exponent \u03b6 on smaller scales, the stronger the\n\"abnormal\" events on smaller scales. This gives\nrise to the spiky structure of an intermittent field.\nGenerally speaking, the intermittent exponent \u03b6\nmeasures the smoothness of the field: for positive\n\u03b6, the field is smoother on smaller scales. If \u03b6 is\nnegative, the field is rough on small scales, and\ncan even be singular.\n\nDefinition of the intermittent exponent\n\nLet us define density difference \u2206r (x) \u2261 \u03c1(x +\nr) \u2212 \u03c1(x). The density difference is equal to the\ndensity contrast difference, \u03b4(x + r) \u2212 \u03b4(x), if the\nmean density \u03c1\u0304 is normalized to 1. Intermittency\nis now defined by the divergence of the ratio between the high and low order moments |\u2206r (x)|n .\nFor a gaussian field, the statistical properties of a\nfield \u03c1(x) and its difference \u03c1(x + r) \u2212 \u03c1(x) are the\nsame, while they are different for an intermittent\nfield.\nThe ensemble average of the moment |\u2206r (x)|2n\nis\nSr2n = h|\u2206r (x)|2n i\n(2)\n\n2.3.\n\nExamples of the intermittent exponent\n\n1. A Gaussian field.\nIf the homogeneous and isotropic field is gaussian, the structure function eq.(2) is\nZ \u221e\nSr2n =\nPg [\u2206r (x)]|\u2206r (x)|2n d\u2206r (x) (6)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere n is a positive integer. If the field is homogeneous, Sr2n is independent of x and depends only\non r. Sr2n is called the structure function. When\n\n7 In\n\n\u0002 \u0003n\n= (2n \u2212 1)!!

The model is essentially the same as the so-called \u03b2-model of the\nintermittency in turbulence where a dimension \u03ba\nfractal distribution in d-dimensional space has the\nexponent \u03b6 is given by eq.(12) (Frisch 1995.)\n4. A Lognormal field\nSince the time of Hubble, the lognormal distribution has been used to model the PDFs of the\ncosmic mass and velocity field, such as the onepoint distribution of the number of galaxies, velocity difference, angular momentum, etc (e.g. Yang\net al. 2001b). The lognormal model of the baryonic matter distribution (Bi & Davidsen, 1997;\nFeng & Fang 2000) has also been found to be in\ngood agreement with all observed properties of the\nLy\u03b1 forests.\nFor a lognormal field, the PDF of \u2206r (x) is given\nby\n\uf8f1\n!\n\uf8f2 1 ln |\u2206 (x)| \u2212 ln |\u2206 (x)| 2\n1\nr\nr\nexp \u2212\nP [\u2206r (x)] = 3/2 1/2\n\uf8f3 2\n\u03c3(r)\n2 \u03c0 |\u2206r (x)|\u03c3(r)\n\nwhere Pg is the gaussian PDF of \u2206r (x). Thus, if\nthe mass density field is gaussian, we have\nSr2n\n= (2n \u2212 1)!!.\n[Sr2 ]n\n\n(7)\n\nThis ratio is independent of scale r, and therefore,\nthe intermittent exponent \u03b6 = 0.\n2. A self-similar field\nFor a self-similar field, the average of \u2206r (x) on\ndifferent scales satisfies\nh|\u2206r (x)|2n i = \u03bb2nh h|\u2206\u03bbr (x)|2n i\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bb gives the scale factor from r to \u03bbr, and h\nis the self-similar index. In this case, we have\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132nh\nr\n2n\nSr =\nSr2n\n(9)\n\u2032 ,\nr\nand therefore\nS 2n\nSr2n\n\u2032\n= 2r n .\n2\nn\n[Sr ]\n[Sr\u2032 ]\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, Sr2n /[Sr2 ]n is independent of r. We have\nthen \u03b6 = 0 and self-similar fields are not intermittent.\n3. Hierarchical clustering.\nHierarchical clustering is popular in modeling\nthe nonlinear clustering of galaxies. This scheme\nassumes that the correlation functions of the mass\ndensity can be described by the linked-pair approximation, i.e., the n-th irreducible correlation\nfunction \u03ben is given by the two-point correlation\nfunction \u03be2 as \u03ben = Qn \u03be2n\u22121 , where the hierarchical coefficient Qn is constant (White 1979).\nIt has been shown that a hierarchical clustered\nfield is (Feng, Pando & Fang 2001)\n\u0010 r \u0011\u2212(d\u2212\u03ba)(n\u22121)\nSr2n\n,\n\u221d\n[Sr2 ]n\nL\n\n(13)\nwhere the variance \u03c3(r) of ln |\u2206r (x)| can be a function of the scale r. With eq.(13), we have (Vanmarcke 1983)\n2\n2\nSr2n\n= e2(n \u2212n)\u03c3 (r) .\n[Sr2 ]n\n\nUsing eq.(5), the intermittent exponent of a lognormal field is\n\u03b6 \u2243 2(n2 \u2212 n)\u03c3 2 (r)/ ln(r/L).\n\n(15)\n\nWhen r < L, \u03b6 is negative. Therefore, a lognormal\nfield is intermittent.\nTo summarize, the structure function and intermittent exponent provide a complete and unified description of intermittent fields. The n- and\nr-dependencies of the structure functions and intermittent exponent \u03b6 are sensitive to the details\nof the intermittency of the field. These measures are very powerful for distinguishing among\nfields that are gaussian, self-similar, mono-fractal,\nmulti-fractal, and singular.\n\n(11)\n\nwhere d is the spatial dimension, and the coefficient \u03ba is a constant depending on the power law\nindex of the power spectrum. In the case where\n\u03ba < d, the field is intermittent with exponent\n\u03b6 \u2243 \u2212(d \u2212 \u03ba)(n \u2212 1).\n\n(14)\n\n(12)\n\nThis is the simplest type of intermittency \u2013\na mono-fractal with fractal dimension \u03ba in ddimensional space. A phenomenological model\n4\n\n\f3.\n3.1.\n\nterval l is from x1 +Ll/2j to x1 +L(l+1)/2j . That\nis, we decompose the space L into cells (j, l), where\nj denotes the scale L/2j , and l the spatial range\n(x1 +Ll/2j , x1 +L(l+1)/2j ). Cell (j, l) is localized\nin scale space and physical (or redshift) space.\nCorresponding to each cell, there is a scaling\nfunction \u03c6j,l (x), and a wavelet function \u03c8j,l (x).\nThese functions are the basis for the scale-space\ndecomposition. The most important property of\nthe DWT basis is its locality in both scale and\nphysical spaces. The scaling function \u03c6j,l (x) is a\nwindow function on scale j and at position l. The\nwavelet function\n\u03c8jl (x) is admissible (Daubechies\nR\n1992), i.e., \u03c8jl (x)dx = 0, and therefore, it measures the fluctuation on scale j and at position l.\nWith the DWT, a transmission F (x) can be\ndecomposed as (Fang & Thews 1998).\n\nThe intermittent exponent\nStatistical variables in the DWT representation\n\nThe quantity \u2206r (x) or [\u03b4(x+ r)\u2212 \u03b4(x)] contains\ntwo variables: the position x and the scale r, and\ntherefore, \u03b4(x)\u2212\u03b4(x+r) should be calculated with\na space-scale decomposition. Moreover, as defined\nby eq.(2), Sr2n is sometimes a diverging quantity.\nFor instance, hSr2 i = 2[h\u03b4(x)\u03b4(x)i \u2212 h\u03b4(x)\u03b4(x + r)i]\nis divergent if the 2-point correlation function\nh\u03b4(x)\u03b4(x + r)i \u2243 r\u2212\u03b1 . This problem can be handled in the same way as N-point correlation functions are handled, i.e., smoothing the density field\nat small scale prior to its measurement. However, the size of the smoothing scale is put in by\nhand and might induce uncertainties, especially in\nstudying the scaling behavior on scale comparable\nwith the smoothing size.\nIdeally one would like a space-scale decomposition without the need for pre\u2013smoothing by hand.\nThis leads us to chose the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The DWT performs a smoothing\n\"automatically\" as the density difference [\u03b4(x) \u2212\n\u03b4(x + r)] on scale r is calculated by a difference\nbetween the smoothed densities at spatial ranges\n(x, x + r/2) and (x + r/2, x + r). In wavelet analysis, the smoothing is done scale-by-scale. Moreover, the bases that the DWT uses for smoothing and decomposing distributions are orthogonal\nand complete. The smoothing and decomposition\nare optimized and there is no loss of information.\nFurthermore, no mixing of the density fluctuations\namong different scales occurs. This property is excellent for studying scaling.\nHere we only very briefly introduce the DWT\ndecomposition, as it has been introduced in our\nprevious publications (e.g. Pando & Fang 1996;\nPando & Fang 1998; Fang & Feng 2000). For details on the DWT refer to Mallat (1989a,b); Meyer\n(1992); Daubechies, (1992), and for physical applications, refer to Fang & Thews (1998).\nWe restrict our discussion to a 1-D random field\nof the transmission flux F (x) extending in a spatial or redshift range L = x2 \u2212 x1 . To apply the\nDWT, we first chop the spatial range L = x2 \u2212 x1\nof the 1-D sample into 2j subintervals labeled with\nl = 0, ...2j \u2212 1 where j is a positive integer. Each\nsubinterval spans a spatial range L/2j . The subin-\n\nF (x) =\n\nj\n2X\n\u22121\n\nl=0\n\nj\u2032\n\n\u01ebF\nj,l \u03c6jl (x)\n\n+\n\nJ 2X\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u01eb\u0303F\nj \u2032 ,l \u03c8j \u2032 ,l (x),\n\nj \u2032 =j l=0\n\n(16)\nwhere J is given by the finest scale (resolution) of\nthe sample, i.e., \u2206z = L/2J , and j is the scale of\ninterest. The scaling function coefficient (SFC) \u01ebF\njl\nin eq.(16) is given by projecting F (x) onto \u03c6j,l (x)\nZ\nF\n\u01ebj,l = F (x)\u03c6j,l (x)dx.\n(17)\nThe SFC \u01ebF\nj,l describes the mean (or smoothed)\nfield of the mode (j, l).\nThe wavelet function coefficient (WFC), \u01eb\u0303F\nj,l , in\neq.(16) is obtained by projecting F (x) onto \u03c8j,l (x)\nZ\nF\n\u01eb\u0303j,l = F (x)\u03c8j,l (x)dx.\n(18)\nThe WFC is basically the difference between the\nsmoothed flux F (x) in cells [x1 + lL/2j , x1 + (l +\n1/2)L/2j ] and [x1 +(l+1/2)L/2j , x1 +(l+1)L/2j ].\nTherefore, the WFC \u01eb\u0303F\nj,l can be used as the variable \u03b4(x+r)\u2212\u03b4(x) in \u00a72, where x \u2243 x1 +lL/2j and\nr \u2243 L/2j . All compactly supported wavelet bases\nproduce similar results. We will use Daubechies 4\nin the study below.\n3.2.\n\nThe intermittent exponent in the\nDWT basis\n\nWe can express eq.(3) in the DWT representation by replacing the density difference, \u03b4(x + r) \u2212\n5\n\n\f\u03b4(x), by the wavelet coefficient \u01eb\u0303F\nj,l as discussed in\n\u00a73.1. Thus,\n\nFor our purposes, the useful wavelength region\nis from the Ly\u03b2 emission to the Ly\u03b1 emission, excluding a region of about 0.06 in redshift close to\nthe quasar to avoid any proximity effects. In this\nwavelength range, the number of pixels is about\n1.2 \u00d7 104 for each spectrum.\nFor all bins in this data set, the ratio \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb is\nconstant, \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u2243 13.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 , or \u03b4v \u2243 4.01 km\ns\u22121 , and therefore, the resolution is about 8 km\ns\u22121 . The distance between N pixels in units of\nthe local velocity scale is given by \u2206v = 2c(1 \u2212\nexp [\u2212(1/2)N \u03b4v/c]) km s\u22121 , or wavenumber k =\n2\u03c0/\u2206v km\u22121 s.\nWe do a scale by scale decomposition of the\ndata. We use only 213 = 8192 pixels for each spectrum. Thus, each cell on scale j corresponds to\nN = 213\u2212j pixels. The smallest scales are generally dominated by noise. We study only scales\n\u2265 16 km s\u22121 , corresponding to \u2265 4 pixels or\nj \u2264 11, and k \u2264 0.4 km\u22121 s. Since metal lines\nare generally narrow with Doppler parameter b<\n15 km s\u22121 , ignoring scales less than 16 km s\u22121\nalso suppresses metal line contamination. The algorithm for treating unwanted data (pixels with\nnegative flux or missing data) and detected metal\nlines with space-scale decomposition will be discussed in more detail in \u00a74.3.\nIn applying our algorithm, we sometimes use\nthe 28 QSO transmissions individually, i.e. calculate the statistics of the transmission over each\nQSO separately, and sometimes all the transmissions are treated together. In the latter case,\nwe divide the data into 12 redshift ranges from\nz = 1.6 + n \u00d7 0.20 to 1.6 + (n + 1)\u00d7 0.20 where\nn = 0, 1, ..11. All the transmission flux in a given\nredshift range forms an ensemble. Note that the\nnumber of data points in each redshift range is\ndifferent.\n\nj\n\nSj2n\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X F 2n\n|\u01eb\u0303j,l | ,\n= h|\u01eb\u0303j,l | i = j\n2\n2n\n\n(19)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere j plays the same role as r in eq.(3).

Pju is the power spectrum of the transmitted flux fluctuations \u2206F =\nF \u2212 hF i. In Paper I, or Jamkhedkar, Bi & Fang\n(2001), and Yang et al. (2001a), the power spectrum Pju differs from eq.(20) and (21) by a noise\nterm. Since the noise is gaussian, this term can be\nignored on scales for which Sj2 is larger than the\nvariance of the noise.\nP j\nEq.(20) can also be written as Sj2 = 21j 2l=0\u22121 Pjlu ,\nwhere\n2\nPjlu = |\u01eb\u0303F\n(21)\nj,l |\nwhere Pjlu is the local power, i.e., the power on\nscale j at position l.\nConsidering r \u2243 L/2j , the intermittent exponent \u03b6 [eq.(5)] can be calculated from\nSj2n\n\u221d 2\u2212j\u03b6 .\n[Sj2 ]n\n\n(22)\n\nGenerally, \u03b6 depends on n and j.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nSamples\nKeck data of Ly\u03b1 forests\n\n4.2.\n\nThe experimental data used in our study is the\nsame as Paper I. It consists of 28 Keck HIRES\nQSO spectra (Kirkman & Tytler 1997). The QSO\nemission redshifts cover a redshift range from 2.19\nto 4.11. For each of the 28 QSO's, the data are\ngiven in terms of pixels with wavelength \u03bbi , flux\nF (\u03bbi ) and noise \u03c3(\u03bbi ). The noise includes the\nPoisson fluctuations and the noise due to the background and the instrumentation. The continuum\nof each spectrum is given by IRAF CONTINUUM\nfitting.\n\nSimulation samples\n\nThe simulated samples of the Ly\u03b1 forests are\nproduced as in Paper I. Besides the LCDM model,\nwe also simulate the warm dark matter (WDM)\nmodel, for which the linear power spectrum on\nscales smaller than the free-streaming length of the\nwarm particle, Rf = 0.2(\u03a90 h2 )1/3 (mW /keV)\u22124/3 ,\nis damped exponentially with respect to the pure\nCDM model.\nThe WDM model is believed to be a possible\n\n6\n\n\fcandidate to solve the problem of cuspy halos, or\nthe singular mass profiles of massive objects. The\nproblem appears in high resolution N-body simulations of CDM models where the models predict\ncentral cusps in the dark halos (Jing & Suto 2000).\nHowever, observations instead show soft halo profiles as inferred from low surface brightness galaxies and the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies (Flores & Primack 1994, Burkeret 1995). The WDM\nmodels are able to soften the density profile of the\ncentral core, while at the same time having no\neffect on large scales. Hence, WDM models are\nproposed in order to deal with the nonlinear clustering on small scales. Since the cosmic field on\nthose scales is already intermittent, it is important\nto examine the intermittent behavior of the WDM\nmodels. We consider four WDM models having\nparticle masses mW = 300, 600, 800 and 1000 eV.\n\nCondition (24) is applied at each scale j. If the\nsize of a bad data segment is d, condition (24) only\nflags modes (j, l) on scales less than or comparable to d. Therefore in this algorithm, no rejoining\nand smoothing of the data is needed. We also flag\ntwo modes around a unwanted mode to reduce any\nboundary effects of the chunks. With this method,\nwe can still calculate the structure functions and\nintermittent exponent by eqs.(19), (20) and (22),\nbut the average is not over all modes, but over the\nun-flagged modes only. Since the DWT calculation assumes the sample is periodized, this may\ncause uncertainty at the boundary. To reduce this\neffect, we drop 5 modes near the boundary.\n\n4.3.\n\nThe power spectra of the transmitted flux of\nthe Keck data and simulated LCDM samples have\nbeen studied in detail in Paper I. The spatial distribution of local power Pjlu show spiky features.\nThis property leads to large uncertainty of Pju .\nNow we do a similar analysis for the WDM samples. Fig. 1 plots the mean and error bars for Pju\nfor j = 10 (k = 0.2 km\u22121 s) of the 28 QSO's\npseudo hydro simulation samples for the WDM\nmodel with mW = 300, 600, 800 and 1000 eV. For\neach QSO, we calculate the mean Pju for each realization then calculate the mean over the 20 realizations. The error bar is given by the range\nof Pju s by dropping the highest and lowest Pju of\nthe 20 realizations. This is equivalent to dropping\nthe top and bottom 5% of the data. As expected,\nthe mean power Pju is slightly lower for smaller\nmW . But the error bars of the power spectrum are\ngenerally much larger than the mW -dependence of\nPju .\nIn Fig. 2, we present the mean of the power\nspectrum in 8 redshift bins and on scales j = 8\nto 11 (k = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 km\u22121 s) for the Keck\ndata and all the simulated samples. On scale j = 8\n(k = 0.05 km\u22121 s) and for all redshift bins, the\npowers decrease in the order from LCDM, to the\nWDM of mW = 1000, 800, 600, and 300 eV. This\norder is expected, as on scale j = 8 and redshift\nz > 2, the nonlinear and intermittent features are\nweak, and the power spectra trends are about the\nsame as in linear regime. That is the power is\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nTreatment of unwanted data\n\nIn the Keck transmission flux, there are suspect\ndata including bad pixels (gaps without data), and\nnegative flux pixels. The latter are generally saturated absorption regions having lower S/N . Although the percentage of low S/N data is not\nlarge, it will introduce large uncertainties in the\nanalysis.\nAs in Paper I, we use the conditional-counting\nmethod to treat the unwanted data. Briefly, the\nalgorithm is as follows:\n1. Calculate the SFCs for both the transmission F (\u03bb) and noise \u03c3(\u03bb), i.e.\nZ\nZ\nF\nN\n\u01ebjl = F (x)\u03c6jl (x)dx, \u01ebjl = \u03c3(x)\u03c6jl (x)dx.\n(23)\n\n2. Identify unwanted mode (j, l) using the condition\n\u01ebF\njl\n<f\n(24)\n\u01ebN\njl\nwhere f is a constant. This condition flags\nall modes with S/N less than f . We can also\nflag modes dominated by metal lines.\n3. Since all the statistical quantities in the\nDWT representation are based on an average over the modes (j, l), we do not count\nall the flagged modes when computing these\naverages.\n7\n\nSecond and lower order statistical properties\nThe power spectrum\n\n\fFig. 2.- The power spectrum Pju vs. j for\nKeck data (vertex with three legs), LCDM (vertex with six legs) and WDM models of mW = 1000\n(hexagon), 800 (pentagon), 600 (square) and 300\n(triangle) eV. in redshift bins 1.90 \u00b1 0.1, 2.3 \u00b1 0.1,\n2.5 \u00b1 0.1, 2.7 \u00b1 0.1, 2.9 \u00b1 0.1, 3.1 \u00b1 0.1, 3.3 \u00b1 0.1\nand 3.7 \u00b1 0.1. The wavenumber for scale j is\nk = 0.4 \u00d7 2j\u221211 km\u22121 s.\nsmaller for smaller mW , and the LCDM corresponds to an infinite mass mW . On scales j > 8\n(k > 0.05 km\u22121 s) the trend changes. This is\nbecause the nonlinear evolution is significant on\nthese scales. The mean power is mainly dependent on rare and improbable events, and therefore,\nit induces a large uncertainty.\nFig. 2 also shows that the power spectrum of\nthe WDM model with mW = 300 eV is systematically lower than the power of Keck data on almost all scales and higher redshifts (z > 2.3).\nTherefore, this model can be ruled out by the\npower spectrum. On the other hand, there are\nno systematic differences between the power spectra of the real data, and the LCDM, or WDM\n(mW = 600, 800, 1000eV) data. The dispersions\namong these power spectra generally are less than\na factor of 2. Considering the error bars of the observed power spectrum (Paper I) and that shown\nin Fig. 1 are larger than by a factor of 2, the\nLCDM, mW = 1000, 800 and 600 eV models are\nbasically consistent with the Keck data. This\n\nFig. 1.- The power, Pju , on scale j = 10 (k = 0.2\nkm\u22121 s) of the 28 QSO's pseudo hydro simulated\nsamples for the WDM models mW = 300, 600, 800\nand 1000 eV. The mean is given by average the\nof the power of the 20 realizations for each QSOs.\nThe error bars are the dispersion of 18 realizations,\nwhich are given by dropping the highest and lowest\nPju of the 20 realizations.\n\n8\n\n\fis one reason for proposing WDM models with\nmW > 600 eV.\n5.2.\n\nCumulative distribution function (CDF)\nof local powers\n\nThe PDF of the local power Pjlu [eq.(21)] for\na given j are found to be long tailed (Paper I).\nThis property can also be shown by the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which is defined as the percentage of the modes with local\npower less than a given Pjlu /Pju . Fig. 3 presents\nthe CDFs of Pjlu /Pju on scales j = 8, 9, 10 and\n11 (k = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 km\u22121 s), and in redshift\nrange 1.7 to 1.9.\nThe CDFs generally consist of two parts: a\nrapidly growing branch at Pjlu /Pju < 1, and very\nslowly growing branch at Pjlu /Pju \u226b 1. The latter\nis given by spiky modes and the former from the\npassive modes between the spikes.\nFor a gaussian field, the PDF of Pjlu is a \u03c72 (N =\n1) distribution. The CDF of the \u03c72 distribution\nis also shown in Fig. 3 (dotted line). This CDF\napproaches 1 at Pjlu /Pju \u2243 10, i.e. \u223c 3 \u03c3. Fig. 3\nshows that the CDF of the Keck data approaches\n1 at Pjlu /Pju \u2243 15 (j = 8), 20 (j = 9), 30 (j = 10),\nand 60 (j = 11) and shows that the Keck's CDF on\nsmall scales has a much longer tail than a gaussian\nfield.\nWe also calculate the CDFs of the quasi-hydro\nsimulation samples for the LCDM and WDM models. The CDFs of simulation samples are generally\nin good agreement with the Keck data. Only the\nCDF of model mW = 300 eV on scale j = 8 shows\na strong deviation from Keck data at Pjlu /Pju \u2265 5.\nOn scales j = 10 and 11, the CDFs of the simulation samples show a little more rapid growth at\nPjlu /Pju < 1 than Keck data, and longer tail than\nthe Keck data at Pjlu /Pju > 10. The CDF of the\nsimulation samples approaches 1 at Pjlu /Pju \u2243 60\n(j = 10), and 100 (j = 11). This seems to indicate that the long tail behavior of the quasi-hydro\nsimulation samples is more prominent than the observed samples.\nHowever, care should be taken about any conclusion made with the CDFs. The rapidly growing\nbranch, which is given by the quiet modes, is sensitive to noise. On the other hand, the horizontal\nbranch is sensitive to spiky events, and therefore,\ndepends on the number of modes of the sample\n\nFig. 3.- The CDF of Pjlu /Pju on scales j = 8, 9, 10\nand 11 for Keck data (solid line), LCDM (cross),\nand WDM models of mW = 1000 (hexagon), 800\n(pentagon), 600 (square) and 300 (triangle) eV in\nredshift bins 1.90 \u00b1 0.1.

Therefore, from the CDFs of Fig. 3,\none can only conclude that the LCDM and WDM\nwith mW = 600, 800, and 1000 eV are consistent\nwith the Keck data.\n5.3.\n\nbetween\nthe observation and model prediction is\np\nis senat 2j /L\u01ebF\njl \u2243 1.

Fig. 5 gives the PDFs of 2j /L\u01ebF\njl\non j = 10 (k = 0.2 km\u22121 s) for the LCDM simulation, but withpgaussian noise of different \u03c3 added.\nThe peak at 2j /L\u01ebF\njl \u2243 1 is significantly dependent on the noise. Moreover, for the Keck sample,\nthe noise level is correlated with F . Generally,\nnoise is high at F \u2243 1, and low\np at F \u2243 0. This\nmakes the peak of the PDF at 2j /L\u01ebF\njl \u2243 1 more\nuncertain.\n\nProbability distribution functions of\nthe SFCs\n\np\nFig. 4.- The PDF of flux 2j /L\u01ebF\njl on scales j =\n12 for observed (histogram) and simulated LCDM\nsamples (circular) of Q0130 on scales j = 12 (k =\n0.8 km\u22121 s). The redshift of the transmitted flux\nis in the ranges z = 2.4 - 2.6. The error bars are\ngiven by bootstrap resampling.\n\np\nFig. 5.- The PDF of SFCs 2j /L\u01ebF\njl scales j =\n10 (k = 0.2 km\u22121 s) for simulated LCDM samples\nfor Q0130. The samples are added gaussian noise\nin each bin with standard deviation zero (solid),\n\u03c3 (dot), 2\u03c3 (dash), and 4\u03c3 (dot-dash), where \u03c3 is\nthe mean standard deviation for the keck samples.\n\nThe PDF of the transmitted flux F is often used\nas a statistical measure of the Ly\u03b1 forests. The\nSFCs \u01ebF\njl defined by eq.(17) are proportional to\nthe Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux at position l. The \u01ebF\njl\np\nflux\nmultiplied by 2j /L is the mean transmitted\np\nin the cell (j, l). Therefore, the PDF of 2j /L\u01ebF\njl\nis the PDF of F smoothed on scale j.\np As anF example, Fig. 4 presents the PDF of\n2j /L\u01ebjl for the observed QSO, Q0131 on scales\nj = 12. The error bars are given by bootstrap\nresampling.\nIn Fig. 4, we also plot the PDFs\np\n\u22121\nof 2j /L\u01ebF\ns) for a\njl on j = 12 (k = 0.8 km\nsimulation sample of the LCDM model. It can\nbe seen, even on this small scale, that the PDFs\nof the simulation sample basically are still consistent with observations. The biggest difference\n\nStatistics with SFCs \u01ebF\njl [eq.(17)] generally are\nmore sensitive to noise than WFCs \u01eb\u0303F\nj,l [eq.(18)].\nF\nThis is because \u01eb\u0303j,l is the density difference between neighboring positions, and the uncertainty\nof the background noise on large scales is canceled\nin this difference. On the other hand, \u01ebF\njl is the\nmean density at l, it is contaminated by the uncertainty of the background noise on all large scales.\nThus, one may conclude that the PDFs of flux F\nis not reliable as a discriminator.\n\n10\n\n\f6.\n6.1.\n\nStructure functions and intermittent\nexponent of Ly\u03b1 forests\nStructure functions\n\nWith eqs.(19) and (22), we calculate the structure functions for the transmitted flux fluctuations\nof the Keck data. A typical result is plotted in\nFig. 6, which is given by the Keck data in redshift\nrange z = 2.50 \u00b1 0.1 for all QSOs. The error bars\nare the maximum and minimum of bootstrap resampling. It is well known that the higher order\ncorrelation functions for large scale structure samples have larger error than the 2-point correlation\nfunction. However, even for the 8th order statistic ln Sj8 /(Sj2 )4 , the error bars are not much larger\nthan that of the power spectrum, i.e., the second\norder statistics Pju . The structure functions are a\nvery stable statistical quantity because the structure functions are a ratio between Sj2n and (Sj2 )n ,\nwhich reduces the effect caused by high spikes.\nFig. 6 shows that, for a given n, ln Sj2n /(Sj2 )n\nincreases with scale j, and therefore, the intermittent exponent \u03b6 is non-zero and negative [eq.(22)].\nThe distribution of the transmitted flux fluctuations are neither gaussian nor self-similar, but essentially intermittent. At other redshift ranges,\nthe structure functions behave similarly. This conclusion was already found with the local power distribution (Paper I). However, the local power distribution is based on the measures of each individual mode, \u01eb\u0303F\nj,l and has a large uncertainty. The distribution of local power is not effective for model\ndiscrimination. On the other hand, the structure\nfunction is calculated by taking an average among\nmodes. Statistically, they are more effective to test\nmodels.\nThis point can be seen with Fig. 7, which plots\nthe structure function ln Sj2n /(Sj2 )n of the transmitted flux fluctuations of the simulation samples\nfor the LCDM and WDM models in redshift range\nz = 2.50 \u00b1 0.1. The error bars are the maximum\nand minimum of bootstrap resampling. As a comparison, the structure functions of the Keck data\nare shown in each panel too. We can see from Fig.\n7 that the structure functions of the LCDM and\nWDM models show intermittent behavior. However, the j-dependence of the structure functions\nof either the LCDM or the WDM models is clearly\ndifferent from the Keck data. For the simulation\nsamples, the slope is steeper than the Keck data.\n\nFig. 6.- log2 [Sj2n /(Sj2 )n ] vs. j with n=2, 3, 4 for\nKeck samples in the redshift range z = 2.5 \u00b1 0.1.\nThe error bars are given by the maximum and\nminimum of bootstrap resampling. The wavenumber for scale j is k = 0.4 \u00d7 2j\u221211 km\u22121 s.\nThis result shows that the intermittent behavior\ncannot be measured by any individual high order\nmoment or correlation function, but must be measured by the scale- and n-dependencies of the ratio\nbetween the moments.\nIt is also interesting to point out that the structure functions on small scales j = 9, 10, and 11\n(k = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 km\u22121 s) are larger for smaller\nmass mW . The structure functions of mW = 300\neV are always the largest one compared to the\nother models. This is because the WDM model\nwith smaller mass mW , or longer free-streaming\nlength Rf , lacks power on small scales. The density fluctuations on those small scales mainly originate from the nonlinear process of transferring\npower from large to small scales (Suto & Sasaki\n1991). On the other hand, the structure function ln Sj2n /(Sj2 )n is the 2n-th moment S 2n normalized by the power S 2 , and hence, essentially\nmeasures the fraction of density fluctuations which\nundergoes a nonlinear evolution due to transfer of\npower. Therefore, smaller mW leads to a stronger\nintermittency on scales less than Rf .\nFigs. 6 and 7 show that the relations of\n\n11\n\n\fFor a given j, the n-dependence of \u03b6(n) is given\nby ln2 Sj2n /(Sj2 )n vs. n.\nFig. 8 presents ln2 Sj2n /(Sj2 )n vs. n for the Keck\ndata in the redshift range z = 2.50 \u00b1 0.1. For a\ngaussian field, the n-dependence of ln2 Sj2n /(Sj2 )n\nis given by eq.(7), i.e. ln2 (2n \u2212 1)!!, which is also\nplotted in Fig. 8. The figure shows that the difference between the Keck data and a gaussian field\nis greatest at small scales.\nMore interesting is to fit the observed ndependence of ln2 Sj2n /(Sj2 )n with\nln2\n\nln Sj2n /(Sj2 )n vs. j for all models and Keck data\ncan be very well fitted by a line. That is, the\nintermittent exponent \u03b6, which is the slope of the\nfitting line, is a constant in the scale range from\nj = 5 to 11 [eq.(22)], i.e. from k = 0.006 to 0.4\nkm\u22121 s.\nn-dependence of the intermittent exponent\n\nWe now turn to the n-dependence of the structure function and intermittent exponent. From\neq.(22), we have\n\nor\n\nSj2n\n1\n\u03b6(n) = \u2212 ln2 2 n + const,\nj\n(Sj )\n\n(25)\n\nSj2n\n1\n\u03b6(n) \u2212 \u03b6(1) = \u2212 ln2 2 n ,\nj\n(Sj )\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nThe motivation is simple, as \u03b1 = 0 corresponds\nto hierarchical clustering [eq.(12)], and \u03b1 = 1 to\na lognormal field [eq.(15)]. Fig. 8 shows that the\nbest fit of \u03b1 for the Keck data is about 0.3 on scales\nj = 8 and 9 (k = 0.05 and 0.1 km\u22121 s), but \u03b1 \u2243 0.5\nor higher on scales j = 10 and 11 (k = 0.2 and 0.4\nkm\u22121 s). This indicates that the transmitted flux\nis closer to a lognormal field on small scales. In\nother words, on scales for which the intermittency\nhas been fully developed, the transmitted flux field\ncan be modeled by a lognormal field. This may be\nthe reason that lognormal models of Ly\u03b1 forests\nmatch very well with observations not only at second and lower order statistics of Ly\u03b1 forests Bi &\nDavidsen, 1997), but also with higher order behavior, like the scale-scale correlations (Feng & Fang\n2000).\nFigs. 9 and 10 are, respectively, the ln2 Sj2n /(Sj2 )n\nvs. n for the LCDM model and the WDM models\nwith mW = 300 eV. They are significantly different from a gaussian field. This is consistent\nwith the CDFs results (\u00a74.2). The best fit for \u03b1\nis always about 0.2, regardless of scale. For the\nWDM models with other mass mW , the results are\nsimilar to Figs. 9 and 10. That is, the intermittency of the simulation samples is approximately\nthat of hierarchical clustering, i.e., a mono-fractal\ndistribution.\nThus, one may conclude that the intermittency\nof the simulation samples is different from those\nof the Keck data not only quantitatively, but also\nqualitative. The former is scale-independent, and\nclose to a hierarchical clustering, while the later is\nclose to a lognormal field on small scales.\n\nFig. 7.- log2 [Sj2n /(Sj2 )n ] vs. j for the models of the LCDM (star) and WDM mW = 1000\n(hexagon), 800 (pentagon), 600 (square) and 300\n(triangle) eV in the redshift range z = 2.5 \u00b1 0.1,\nand n = 2, 3 and 4. For comparison, the result\nfor Keck data(vertex with three legs) is also plotted. The error bars are given by the maximum\nand minimum of bootstrap resampling.

The wavenumber for scale j is k = 0.4 \u00d7 2j\u221211 km\u22121 s.\n6.3.\n\nRedshift-dependence of intermittent\nexponent\n\nLy\u03b1 forests and massive halos is probably due to\nthe fact that the QSO's transmitted flux is given\nmainly by the absorption of baryonic matter outside of the collapsed massive halos, i.e., the weakly\nclustered area. Collapsed halos correspond to the\nsaturated absorption in the transmitted flux for\nwhich the S/N generally is low. Therefore, the\nLy\u03b1 forest does not contain information on the\ndetails of the massive halos.\nFig. 11 also shows that the intermittent exponents of the LCDM and WDM models with\nmW = 300 eV are about the same. This is also\ndifferent from massive halos, for which the LCDM\nand WDM models predict different mass density\nprofiles and number of substructures.\nWe have simulated the intermittent formation\nat high redshift. The results show that in the area\noutside of the collapsed halos, the intermittency is\nalready well developed at redshift z \u223c 5, and does\nnot increase much for z \u2264 5. Therefore, intermittency is probably the earliest developed nonlinear\nfeature formed during the evolution from the lin-\n\nIn the last two subsections, only redshift z = 2.4\nto 2.6 is considered. For other redshift bins, the\nresult is about the same as z = 2.4 to 2.6. The \u03b6\nagainst redshift z for n = 2, 3 and 4 is shown in\nFig. 11. The error bars are from the least squares\nfitting [eq.(25)].\nIn all redshift ranges, the value of |\u03b6| for the\nKeck data is found to be substantially and systematically lower than that of the LCDM and WDM\nmodels. This can directly be seen from with Fig.\n7. This is also consistent with Figs. 8-10. It is\ninteresting that either for the Keck data or the\nmodels, the intermittent exponents are almost independent of redshifts in the range z = 2 to 4.\nThis is very different from both the observation\nand theory of massive halos. Collapsed halos with\nmass on the order of galaxies and clusters undergo\na significant evolution in the redshift range from\n4 to 2.\nThe difference between the statistics of the\n\n13\n\n\fFig. 11.- \u03b6n vs. z, with n=2, 3, 4 for the Keck\ndata and the LCDM (a), and WDM with mW =\n300 eV.

Even in this case, the simulation samples are still significantly different from the Keck\ndata. Therefore, one can conclude that all results\nof \u00a76.1 to 6.3 are not very sensitive to noise.\n\n6.4.\n\n7.\n\nThe effect of noise\n\nIn the above calculations, we generally take the\nparameter f = 1, i.e., drop modes with S/N \u2264 1.\nThe effect of noise on the statistical result can be\nestimated by the f -dependence, as large f is equal\nto adding large noise to the simulation samples,\nbut still taking f = 1. In Paper I, we showed that\nthe power spectrum Pju is almost f -independent\nwhen f = 1 to 5.\nFig. 12 shows ln Sj2n /(S 2 )n vs. j for the LCDM\nmodel when the noise and f are treated as follows:\n1.) sample without adding noise, and f = 0; 2.)\nsample without adding noise and f = 3; 3.) sample with adding noise and f = 3. Fig. 12 shows\nthat the effect of noise and f should be considered only on the smaller scale j = 11, and can be\nignored on all other scales.\nFig. 13 is similar to Fig. 10, but with added\nnoise and taking f = 3. Similar to Fig. 12, the\neffect of noise and f on \u03b1 should be considered\n\n7.1.\n\nDiscussions and conclusions\nModel-discriminator of nonlinear regime\n\nIn the Paper I, we showed that in the nonlinear\nregime, the cosmic mass field is intermittent and\nthe power spectrum will on longer be a critical\ndiscriminator among models of structure formation. In this paper, we show that for an intermittent field, the structure functions and intermittent\nexponent are the critical discriminators for models of structure formation. This discriminator can\nbe employed not only to distinguish gaussian and\nnon-gaussian fields, but to detect the type of the\nnon-gaussianity. With the n- j- and z-dependence\nof the structure functions and the intermittent exponent, we are able to distinguish between various\nnonlinearly evolved fields in detail. That is, the intermittent exponent provides both qualitative and\nquantitative measures of the cosmic mass and velocity fields from the linear to nonlinear regimes\n\n14\n\n\fFig. 12.- log2 Sj2n /(S 2 )n vs. j for simulation\nsample of the LCDM. The noise and f are treated\nby the following ways: 1.) sample without adding\nnoise, and f = 0 (triangle), 2.) sample without\nadding noise and f = 3 (square), 3.) sample with\nadding noise and f = 3 (pentagon). For clarity,\nthe points for 2.) and 3.) are shifted horizontally\nto right from the corresponding j. The wavenumber for scale j is k = 0.4 \u00d7 2j\u221211 km\u22121 s.\n\n7.2.\n\nand from large to small scales.\nWe show that the distribution of the transmitted flux fluctuations of the QSO's Ly\u03b1 forests is\nintermittent and closer to a lognormal field on\nsmall scales. Obviously, this conclusion is important in order to understand the dynamics of the\nclustering evolution of baryonic matter. It will\nbe interesting to study when this feature formed,\nand whether the intermittency on scales less than\nj = 11 (k = 0.4 km\u22121 s) is closer to a lognormal\nfield. These problems can be studied with samples at higher redshift and higher S/N than the\none used in this work.\nUsing intermittent features, even \"weakly\"\nclustered samples, such as QSO's Ly\u03b1 absorption\nspectrum, can play an important role for testing structure formation dynamics in the nonlinear\nregime. It is also important to detect the intermittency of galaxy distributions, as the transmitted\nflux of Ly\u03b1 cannot provide information of highly\ncollapsed regions in the cosmic mass field. Note\n\nAlthough the pseudo-hydro simulation samples\nfor the LCDM and WDM models are good in\nagreement with the Keck data in terms of the\npower spectrum, PDF and CDF of the transmission flux fluctuations, they are significantly and\nsystematically inconsistent with the intermittent\nfeatures of the Keck data. Specifically, 1.) the\nstructure functions of the simulation samples are\nlarger than that of Keck data on scales less than\nk = 0.1 km\u22121 s; 2.) the intermittent exponents\nof the simulation samples are more negative than\nthat of Keck data on all redshifts considered; 3.)\nthe n-dependence of the intermittent exponent of\nsimulation samples are close to the intermittency\nof hierarchical clustering on all scales, while the\nKeck data are close to a lognormal field on small\nscales. That is, the model-predicted intermittency\nis quantitatively and qualitatively different from\nthe observed results.\nThis is probably the first result to reveal the deviation of the popular dark model LCDM model\n\nFig. 13.- The same as Fig. 10, but the sample is\nadded with noise and f is taken to be 3.\nthat from the definition of the structure function\neq.(1), the intermittent exponent is bias-free if the\ngalaxy bias is linear, i.e. \u03c1galaxy = b\u03c1dark matter .\n\n15\n\nProblems with the LCDM and WDM\nsamples\n\n\fof the power is contributed by the top 5% modes\nfor unnormalized power spectrum, and 1% modes\nfor the locally-normalized power spectrum. Therefore, before making conclusions about the dark\nmatter parameters, we should study whether the\ndeviation is caused by the dynamical assumptions\non the relation between the IGM and dark matter. We should also study the effects of simulation\nparameters (size, resolution etc) on intermittency.\nNevertheless, the current result is strong enough\nto conclude that all theory and models on the dynamics of nonlinear evolution of the cosmic mass\nand velocity fields must be examined with their\npredictions of intermittency. For models which\nare almost degenerate in the linear regime, the\ntests with intermittency in nonlinear regime are\ncrucial.\nFinally, we should mention that the dynamical\nevolution of cosmic clustering was found to be able\nto sketch by the stochastic-force-driven Burgers'\nequation (Berera & Fang 1994; Jones 1999), or the\nso-called KPZ equation (Kardar, Parisi & Zhang\n1986; Barab\u00e1si & Stanley 1995). These equations\nare typical of dynamical models which lead to intermittency (e.g. Polyakov, 1995; E, et al 1997;\nBalkovsky et al. 1997). These examples clearly\nillustrate that intermittency is a basic property of\nthe nonlinearly evolved cosmic mass field. Hence,\nwe strongly believe that intermittency is a window to the dynamical evolution of cosmic nonlinear clustering. Knowledge of intermittency may\nultimately lead to a better understanding of the\nstill intractable problem of galaxy formation.\n\nfrom the Ly\u03b1 forest observations. However, we\nshould be very careful in reaching conclusions ruling out the relevant dark matter models. For a\nlinear gaussian field, all statistics can be determined by power spectrum with given dark matter\nparameters. However, intermittency arises from\nthe nonlinear evolution and depends not only on\nthe cosmological parameters, but also on 1.) dynamical assumptions of the relation between the\nIGM and underlying dark matter field and 2.) parameters used for simulation.\nFor instance, the lognormal model of Ly\u03b1\nforests (Bi & Davidsen 1997, Feng & Fang 2000)\nassumes phenomenologically that the nonlinear\nfield of baryonic matter is given by a lognormal\ntransformation of the underlying mass field in linear regime. The sample given by this dynamical\nassumption can certainly fit with a lognormal PDF\nof the Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux.\nIn the pseudo hydro simulation, the density of\nbaryonic matter in each pixel is assigned according to the dark matter density at that pixel. This\nis equal to phenomenologically assuming that the\nstatistical property of the baryonic matter is determined by the underlying mass field. This assumption is reasonable in terms of second and lower\norder statistics. However, it may not be correct\nin the context of intermittency. That is, although\nbaryonic matter can be considered as a passive\ncomponent in the system consisting of dark matter and baryonic matter, the statistical properties\nof the passive component can decouple from the\nunderlying mass field during the nonlinear evolution (Shraiman & Siggia 2000). For instance, a diffused passive substance can exhibit intermittency,\neven when the underlying mass field is gaussian\n(Kraichnan, 1994). This is due to the nonlinear\nevolution of this two component system.\nMoreover, the parameters of simulation may\nalso cause uncertainty in measuring the intermittency. In the paper I, we studied the effect of the\nsample size on the power spectrum. When the\ncharacteristic spacing between high spikes (long\ntail events) exceed the spatial size of samples, the\nspatial averages cease to coincide with ensemble\naverages. As a consequence, the mean power of the\ntransmission fluctuations is concentrated in rare\nbut large spikes while the other modes have low\npower, or are even inactive. We showed that on\nscales less than k \u2243 0.10 km\u22121 s, 50% or more\n\nLLF acknowledges support from the National\nScience Foundation of China (NSFC) and National\nKey Basic Research Science Foundation.
