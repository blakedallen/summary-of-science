Brown in [6].\nAdditional facts about these groups can be found in [8, 22]. The case p = 2 corresponds\nto the famous Richard Thompson's group F . See the survey [9] for details about this\ngroup.\nThe groups F (p) have many common features. All of them are embeddable into each\nother [4]. None of them has free non-abelian subgroups. None of these groups satisfy\nany nontrivial group law. The derived subgroups of each of the F (p) is simple (infinitely\ngenerated). Every proper homomorphic image of F (p) is abelian (so these groups are not\nresidually finite). Each F (p) is finitely presented and has quadratic Dehn function [16].\nEach of these groups has a faithful representation by piecewise linear functions. The word\nproblem has an easy solution in each of these groups. Also all these groups are diagram\ngroups in the sense of [17]. Namely, F (p) is a diagram group over a very simple semigroup\npresentation h x | x = xp i. It follows then from [17, Section 15] that F (p) has solvable\nconjugacy problem. Each group F (p) satisfies homological finiteness condition F\u221e . All\ninteger homology groups Hn (F (p), Z) are free abelian of finite rank and the Poincar\u00e9 series\nare rational [19].\nHowever, there is some difference between the groups of this family. Brin [3] described\nthe group Aut F for F = F (2). Some information about automorphisms of F (p), where\np > 2, can be found in [4], where it is shown that already for p = 3 there are \"wild\"\nautomorphisms of F (p).\nThe goal of this article is to obtain analogs of some results for the group F . The first\nauthor found the growth function of the monoid of positive elements of F . This function\nDate: August 13, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In this paper we show that\nfor any p, the exact value of the growth rate of positive elements is only slightly higher\nthan p - it never exceeds p + 1/2.\nGuba and Sapir [18] found two new normal forms for elements of F . One of them is a\nnormal form in the infinite set of generators. This normal form is locally testable (unlike\nthe standard normal form). It has the same feature as the normal form in the free group:\na word is in a normal form if and only if all its subwords of length 2 are in the normal form.\nIn this paper, we find such a form for every F (p). Another normal form constructed in\n[18] for F allows one to construct a regular set of normal forms in F . We find an analogous\nconstruction for each F (p).\nUsing the above regular normal form, the second author\u221aproved in [15] that the growth\nrate of the group F in generators x0 , x1 is at least (3 + 5)/2. Notice that neither the\ngrowth function, nor the growth rate for F is known at the present. In this paper we find\na lower bound of the growth rate for each of the groups F (p), where the generating set\nconsists of x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 . We show that the lower bound is a root of a certain algebraic\nequation and find the asymptotic behaviour of this root. For large values of p, this is\n(p \u2212 1/2) log2 e + 1/2, where log2 e = 1.442695 . . . .\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we recall the definition of the family\nF (p) of generalized Thompson's groups and some basic facts about growth functions and\ngrowth rates. This Section also contains a description of (positive) elements in F (p) in\nterms of rooted p-trees.\nIn Section 2 we describe Fordham's method to calculate the word length in F (p). We\nrestrict ourselves to the case of positive words only (the description for this case is much\nsimpler). Recall that for the case p = 2, a fast algoritm to find the word length metric\nwas described in [11, 12]. This algorithm is very effective but it has quite a complicated\ndescription. A simplification of the method due to Belk and Brown can be found in [1].\nOne of the easiest algorithms to find the word length in F (the so-called Length Formula)\nis contained in [15, Section 5]. Notice that for p > 2, none of the simplified versions exists\nso we use Fordham's approach from [13].\nIn Section 3, using Fordham's method, we find equations for generating functions describing the growth of F+ (p). We solve these equations in Section 4 and show that the\ngenerating function for positive words in F (p) is irrational provided p > 2 (unlike the case\np = 2). Then we find the growth rate of positive words in F (p) as a root of an algebraic\nequation. We prove that this growth rate never exceeds p + 1/2 approaching this value\nas p approaches infinity. Thus the set F+ (p) of all positive words is not much higher than\nthe free submonoid generated by x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 .\nSection 5 describes two new normal forms of elements in F (p). The first of these forms is\nlocally testable (one needs to test only subwords of length 2, similar to a free group). The\nsecond of the normal forms leads to a regular language that represents each element of F (p)\nexactly once. Based on that regular language, we construct the corresponding automaton\nand find a lower bound for the growth rate of F (p) in Section 6. This lower bound is given\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n3\n\nas a root of an algebraic equation. We also describe its asymptotic behaviour showing\nthat it approaches (p \u2212 1/2) log2 e + 1/2 for large values of p.\n1. Preliminaries\nThe family of generalized Thompson's group can be defined as follows. The group F (p)\nis the group of all piecewise linear self homeomorphisms of the unit interval [0, 1] that are\norientation preserving (that is, send 0 to zero and 1 to 1) with all slopes integer powers\nof p and such that their singularities (breakpoints of the derivative) belong to Z[ 1p ]. The\ngroup F (p) admits a presentation given by\n(1)\n\nh xi (i \u2265 0) | xj xi = xi xj+p\u22121 (i < j) i.\n\nThis presentation is infinite, but a close examination shows that the group is actually\nfinitely generated, since x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 are sufficient to generate it. In fact, the group\nis finitely presented. The finite presentation is awkward and it is not used much. The\nsymmetric and simple nature of the infinite presentation makes it much more adequate\nfor almost all purposes.\nOne such example where the infinite presentation is particularly appropriate is in the\nconstruction of the normal form. A word given in the generators xi and their inverses,\ncan have its generators moved around according to the relators, and the result is the\nfollowing well-known statement:\nTheorem 1.1. An element in F (p) always admits an expression of the form\nwhere\n\n\u22121 \u22121\nxi1 xi2 * * * xim x\u22121\njn * * * xj2 xj1 ,\n\ni1 \u2264 i2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 im , j1 \u2264 j2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 jn .\nIn general, this expression is not unique, but for every element there is a unique word of\nthis type which satisfies certain technical condition (see [9] for details). This unique word\nis called the standard normal form for the element of F (p).\nObserve that the infinite presentation for F (p) is actually a monoid presentation. Hence\nF (p) admits a submonoid, the submonoid F+ (p) given by the same presentation, whose\nelements are called positive words. Theorem 1.1 shows that F (p) is the group of right\nfractions of this monoid.\nAn element of F (p) can be represented by two subdivisions of the interval [0, 1], namely,\nthe subdivision into intervals which get mapped linearly to each other. A subdivision of\nthis type, where the dividing points are all in Z[ 1p ], can always be obtained by subsequent\nsubdivisions of the interval into p equal pieces. Hence, a subdivision of the interval is\nequivalent to a rooted tree where each vertex has valence p + 1 except the root, which has\nvalence p (or 1 in case when the tree consists of the root only), and the leaves, which have\nvalence 1. A node (except the root and the leaves) is pictured to have one edge going up\nand p edges going down to its p children. These trees will be called rooted p-trees. An\nelement of F (p) is then represented by a pair of rooted p-trees called the source tree and\nthe target tree. This representation has been extensively studied in the case p = 2. Note\nthat positive words can be represented by a single p-tree, because the other tree is always\nthe same: the tree which consists of all right carets.\n\n\f4\n\nJOS\u00c9 BURILLO AND VICTOR GUBA\n\nA piece of these p-trees consisting of a node and its p edges going down to its children\nis called a caret. Carets are the building blocks of the trees and they give rise to the\nalgorithm for finding the word metric in F (p), see Section 2.\nAs stated in the introduction, the exact growth function for the groups F (p) is not known.\nIn this paper we will give lower bounds for growth rates of these groups, computing lower\nbounds for the number of elements in each length.\nTo be precise, given a finitely generated group G with finite generating set X, denote its\nsphere of radius n by\nS(n) = { g \u2208 G | l(g) = n },\n\nwhere l(g) is the length of g \u2208 G in the set of generators X. We also have the ball of\nradius n\nn\n[\nS(k).\nB(n) =\nk=0\n\nIf \u03b3n = #B(n), the series\n\u0393(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b3n xn\n\nn=0\n\nis called the (general) growth function for G with respect to X, and the number\n\u03b3 = lim \u03b3n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nis the growth rate of G with respect to X. The limit always exists due to the submultiplicative property of \u03b3n , that is, \u03b3m+n \u2264 \u03b3m \u03b3n for all m, n \u2265 0. Also, the spherical growth\nfunction is given by \u03c3n = #S(n) and\n\u03a3(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c3n xn ,\n\nn=0\n\nwhich has the same growth rate as the general growth function (for all infinite groups).\nFor details about growth functions, see, for instance, [14].\nIf P \u2286 G is a subset of a group, not necessarily a subgroup, we can define the growth\nfunctions of the set P by the same formulas as above but where the coefficients are actually\nthe cardinals of the sets P \u2229 B(n) or P \u2229 S(n). The goal for one of the next sections is to\ncompute the growth series of the subset F+ (p) in F (p). In order to do that, we need to\ndescribe the algorithm for calculating the word metric in F (p).\n2. Positive words in Thompson's groups F (p) and Fordham's method\nIn 1995, S. Blake Fordham [11] constructed an algorithm which, for any given element in\nF = F (2), finds its distance to the identity in the word metric given by generators x0 ,\nx1 . This algorithm consists in defining different types of carets, then having each caret of\nthe source tree paired to its corresponding caret in the target tree, and assigning a weight\nto each type of pairs of carets. A table is given for all possible pairs of types, with the\nassignment of the weight. The sum of all the weights of all the pairs is the exact distance\nfrom the element to the identity. In a set of unpublished notes [13], Fordham extends his\nmethod to the groups F (p). This method will be the starting block of the computation.\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n5\n\nThe method used to compute this growth will be an extension to F (p) of the method\ndeveloped in [7] for the case of F = F (2). Consider a positive element of F (p). As we\nknow, the element can be represented by a rooted p-tree. We are going to define different\ntypes of carets and their weights, following Fordham [13].\nA caret will be called left or right if it is situated in the leftmost edge of the tree or in\nthe rightmost edge, and middle or interior if it is situated in the middle, i.e. if it is not\nright or left. For instance, a caret is left if it represents a subinterval of [0, 1] which has\nleft endpoint equal to zero. Middle carets will be subdivided into p \u2212 1 types, denoted\nby M1 , M2 , . . . , Mp\u22121 according to which caret they are children of, and its position as\nchild.\nThe children of a caret are subdivided in two types, the predecessors and the successors.\nThis subdivision will give a total order to the set of carets, with a caret being always after\nits predecessor children and before its successors. The definitions of the caret types are\nas follows:\n\u2022 The root caret is special. Its children are:\n\u2013 Its left child is a left caret and it is the only predecessor.\n\u2013 Its middle children are successors, and have types M1 , M2 , . . . , Mp\u22122 , in\norder-preserving way.\n\u2013 Its right child is obviously a successor and a right caret.\n\u2022 A left caret has the following children:\n\u2013 Its only predecessor is the left child, a left caret.\n\u2013 All the other children are successors, all middle carets, and of types M1 , M2 ,\n. . . , Mp\u22121, in order.\n\u2022 A right caret has the following children:\n\u2013 One single predecessor of type Mp\u22121.\n\u2013 It has p \u2212 1 successors, which in order are of types M1 , M2 , . . . , Mp\u22122 and\nthe last one of type R.\n\u2022 A caret of type Mi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1) has the following children:\n\u2013 The first p \u2212 i children are predecessors, and their types are Mi , . . . , Mp\u22121.\n\u2013 The other i children are successors, and they are of types M1 , M2 , . . . , Mi .\nFor the purposes of computing the length of an element, these caret types are subdivided\nin further types depending on the existence of predecessor and successor types. This\nclassification is actually more complicated in Fordham's paper but we do not need the\ntotal strength of the method since we are dealing only with positive words. We will\nindicate also which is the weight of each caret for the purposes of the computation of the\nlength of a positive word.\nThe caret types are as follows:\n\u2022 The root, which has always weight zero.\n\u2022 Left carets, which have always weight one.\n\u2022 Carets of type R\u2205 are right carets whose all successors are right carets, i.e., it\nhas no middle successors. Its only successors hang from its rightmost leaf. These\ncarets carry weight zero.\n\u2022 Carets of type RM are right carets which are not R\u2205, that is, which have middle\nsuccessors. Observe that the middle successors do not have to be immediate\n\n\f6\n\nJOS\u00c9 BURILLO AND VICTOR GUBA\n\nsuccessors, they can be successors of successors. Carets of type RM have weight\ntwo.\n\u2022 Carets of type Mi\u2205 are middle carets which do not have any successor children.\nThey carry weight one.\n\u2022 Carets of type MiM are middle carets which have at least a successor child. These\ncarets have weight three.\nObserve that the index on the middle carets is only necessary to identify its successors,\nbut it has no role in the weight assignment beyond that one.\nNow, the main theorem giving the length is as follows:\nTheorem 2.1. (S. B. Fordham) [13] Given a positive word in F (p) represented by a rooted\np-tree, the distance from this element to the identity (in the word metric for F (p) with\ngenerators x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 ) is equal to the total sum of the weights of its carets.\n3. Generating functions for the growth of positive words\nOnce the theorem for the length has been established, now the computation of the growth\nfunction is reduced to a combinatorial problem, namely, finding how many trees have a\ngiven weight, according to the rules above. The method for finding the number of trees\nwith a given weight is to split the trees in several ones in such a way that recurrences can\nbe found. The reader can see details about generating functions in [23], and can see this\nmethod used already in [7].\nWe will make use of several sequences:\n\u2022 The sequence sn = #(F+ (p) \u2229 S(n)). This is the number of trees which have\nweight n.\n\u2022 The sequence ln . This sequence gives the number of subtrees which can be left\nsubtrees of a rooted p-tree and such that its total weight is n. The subtrees are\nrequired to be strict, that is, the main tree does not qualify as a left subtree.\n\u2022 Analogously the sequence rn is the sequence of possible right subtrees of weight n.\n(i)\n\u2022 The sequence mn for i = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1, gives the number of interior subtrees which\nstart with a caret of type Mi . Observe that this subtree is completely composed\nof middle carets, and also with total weight n.\nObserve that the subtrees are always considered as subtrees of the main tree, which means\nthat, for instance, a left subtree never has carets of type R because that would mean it\nis the total tree. A subtree which starts in an Mi caret has all interior carets.\nEach one of these sequences will have its generating function:\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\nX\nn\nn\nS(x) =\nsn x\nL(x) =\nln x\nR(x) =\nrn xn\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nMi (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\nm(i)\nn x .\n\nn=0\n\nNow we will establish relations between the sequences which will give functional equations\nfor their generating functions, which then will allow us to find the growth of the submonoid\nof positive words. For instance, if one considers the tree representing a word, and assumes\nthe tree has total weight n, since the root has weight zero, the weight has to be distributed\namong all the p children subtrees. Hence, a tree of total weight n will be obtained every\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n7\n\ntime that we take a family of subtrees such that the sum of their separate weights as\nsubtrees is n.\nThis fact gives the first formula satisfied by the sequences, and also by the generating\nfunctions:\nX\n(1)\n(p\u22122)\n(2)\nsn =\nlj0 mj1 * * * mjp\u22122 rjp\u22121\nj0 +***+jp\u22121 =n\n\nS = LM1 * * * Mp\u22122 R.\n\n(3)\n\nTo find a formula for the function L(x) of left subtrees, one needs to consider that left\ncarets have weight 1. Hence the different subtrees only have to add up to n \u2212 1. The\nformula is\nX\n(1)\n(p\u22122) (p\u22121)\nln =\nlj0 mj1 * * * mjp\u22122 mjp\u22121\nj0 +***+jp\u22121 =n\u22121\n\nL \u2212 1 = xLM1 M2 * * * Mp\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe formula for the generating functions is obtained by multiplying each side of the\nformula for sequences by xn . The right hand side has an x multiplying because the\nindices are shifted by one.\nFor the function for right trees, one has to take into account the fact that a right caret can\nbe of type R\u2205 or RM , with weights zero and two respectively. For the first possibility, the\ncaret is of type R\u2205, and all its successors have no weight. Observe that in a positive word\nthere can be one and only one caret of type R\u2205, because any others would be reducible.\nHence, if the caret is of type R\u2205, all the weight is concentrated in its only predecessor.\nSo there are as many right subtrees of this type as trees of the type Mp\u22121 with the same\n(p\u22121)\nweight, which gives the first part of the recurrence equal to mn .\nIf the right caret is of type RM , it carries weight 2 and one the successors is necessarily\nnonempty with a middle caret somewhere. Hence if one of the successors is necessarily\nnonempty, the term in the recurrence has all possible weights for these successors. The\nformula is\nX\n(p\u22121) (1)\n(p\u22122)\nrn = mn(p\u22121) +\nmj0 mj1 * * * mjp\u22122 rjp\u22121\nj0 +***+jp\u22121 =n\u22122\nj1 +***+jp\u22121 \u22651\n\n(5)\n\nR = Mp\u22121 + x2 (M1 M2 * * * Mp\u22121 R \u2212 Mp\u22121 ).\n\nFinally, the middle subtrees are the ones whose children are also middle subtrees and hence\nfacilitate the resolution of the equations. A middle caret of type Mi has either weight 1\nif its successors are empty or weight 3 if one of the successor subtrees is nonempty. Both\ncases correspond to the two adding terms of the formula for the sequence:\nX\nX\n(p\u22121)\n(1)\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\n(p\u22121)\nmj0 * * * mjp\u2212i\u22121 mjp\u2212i * * * mjp\u22121\nm(i)\n=\n+\nm\n*\n*\n*\nm\nn\nji\njp\u22121\nji +***+jp\u22121 =n\u22121\n\nj0 +j1 +***+jp\u22121 =n\u22123\njp\u2212i +***+jp\u22121 \u22651\n\nwhich gives the following formula for the generating functions:\n(6)\n\nMi \u2212 1 = xMi Mi+1 * * * Mp\u22121 + x3 Mi Mi+1 * * * Mp\u22121 (M1 * * * Mi\u22121 Mi \u2212 1).\n\n\f8\n\nJOS\u00c9 BURILLO AND VICTOR GUBA\n\nSolving these equations will give us information on the function S(x), which is the one\nwe are interested in, and the growth of positive elements in the groups F (p).\n4. Growth functions and growth rates of F+ (p)\nNow we collect formulas (3), (4), (5), (6) to find the equation on S(x) and the radius of\nconvergence of the corresponding series. First of all, we have to mention that F+ (p) has a\nfree submonoid generated by x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 and so the growth rate of F+ (p) is at least\np. As we will see at the end of this Section, the exact value of the growth rate is only\nslightly larger than p. (In fact, it is always less than p + 1/2.)\nLet\nM(x) = M1 (x)M2 (x) * * * Mp\u22121 (x).\nLemma 4.1. For all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, we have\nM1 M2 * * * Mi =\n\nx\u22122\n+ 1 \u2212 x2 .\n3\ni\n(1 \u2212 x M)\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on i. If i = 0, then the result is obvious. Let 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p\u22121.\nFormula (6) can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nxM\nM\n3\nMi = 1 +\n+ x Mi M \u2212\n.\nM1 * * * Mi\u22121\nM1 * * * Mi\u22121\nTherefore,\nM1 * * * Mi = M1 * * * Mi\u22121 + xM + x3 M * M1 * * * Mi \u2212 x3 M\nand so\nM1 * * * Mi (1 \u2212 x3 M) = (x \u2212 x3 )M + M1 * * * Mi\u22121 .\nUsing the inductive assumption, we have\nM1 * * * Mi (1\u2212x3 M) = (x\u2212x3 )M+\n\nx\u22122\nx\u22122\n2\n+1\u2212x\n=\n+(1\u2212x2 )(1\u2212x3 M).\n(1 \u2212 x3 M)i\u22121\n(1 \u2212 x3 M)i\u22121\n\nNow the only thing left to do is to divide by 1 \u2212 x3 M.\n\n\u0003\n\nTaking i = p \u2212 1 gives us\nCorollary 4.2. The function M = M(x) satisfies\n1\n+ x2 \u2212 1.\nx2 M =\n3\np\u22121\n(1 \u2212 x M)\nNow we express S(x) in terms of M(x). It follows from (4) and (5) that\nL=\nNow, using (3), we have\n(7)\n\nS=\n\n1\n1 \u2212 xM\n\nR=\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )Mp\u22121\n.\n1 \u2212 x2 M\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )M\nLMR\n=\n.\nMp\u22121\n(1 \u2212 xM)(1 \u2212 x2 M)\n\nThe first author proved in [7] that the growth function S(x) of positive elements of F =\nF (2) is rational (although M(x) is irrational). Now we have the following\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n9\n\nTheorem 4.3. The growth function S(x) of positive elements in F (p) is irrational provided p \u2265 3.\nProof. Let N = (1 \u2212 x3 M)\u22121 . From Corollary 4.2 we have\n\n1 \u2212 N \u22121 = x3 M = xN p\u22121 + x3 \u2212 x.\n\nHence N = N(x) satisfies the equation\n(8)\n\nxN p + (x3 \u2212 x \u2212 1)N + 1 = 0.\n\nSuppose that S(x) is rational. Then it follows from (7) that M(x) satisfies a quadratic\nequation with coefficients in the field Q(x) of rational functions. Since M = x\u22123 (1\u2212N \u22121 ),\nthe function N(x) also satisfies an equation of degree at most 2 over Q(x). This implies\nthat the polynomial f (t) = xtp + (x3 \u2212 x \u2212 1)t + 1 from Q(x)[t] is divisible by a polynomial\nof degree at most 2. Since p \u2265 3, the polynomial f (t) is reducible over Q(x). A standard\nalgebraic trick (using Gauss' lemma) implies that f (t) is a product of two polynomials\nfrom Z[x][t] of degree less than p. Taking x = 1, we obtain that the polynomial tp \u2212 t + 1\nis reducible over Q. However, this contradicts a result from [20].\n\u0003\nNow we will find the growth rate of F+ (p). To do that, we need to take the radius of\nconvergence of the series for S(x) and take the reciprocal. Observe that from (2) we\ndeduce mn \u2264 sn for all n \u2265 0. This implies that\n(lim sup mn )\u22121 \u2265 (lim sup sn )\u22121 ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nthat is, the radius of convergence of the series S(x) does not exceed the one for the series\nM(x). Let x > 0 be a real number such that S(x) converges. Then M(x) also converges\nand formula (7) holds.\nTo find the radius of convergence of S(x), we need to find the smallest positive real number\nsuch that the denominator of the right hand side of (7) is zero. Since M(x) is increasing\nand 0 < x < 1, the smallest positive solution of the equation M(x) = x\u22121 will not exceed\nthe smallest positive solution of the equation M(x) = x\u22122 . Therefore, we need to solve\nthe equation M(x) = x\u22121 . Notice that M(x) increases and x\u22121 decreases so we can just\nspeak about a positive root of this equation. Using (4.2), we get x = (1\u2212x2 )\u2212(p\u22121) +x2 \u22121,\nthat is, we need to find the positive root of\n(9)\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )p\u22121 (1 + x \u2212 x2 ) = 1.\n\nThe growth rate of F+ (p) will thus be equal to x\u22121 . We already know that the growth\nrate of F+ (p) is at least p, as it was mentioned in the beginning of this Section. Hence\nx \u2264 1/p.\nLet us rewrite this equation in the following form:\np\u22121 =\n\nln(1 + x \u2212 x2 )\n.\n\u2212 ln(1 \u2212 x2 )\n\nFrom the Taylor formula for ln(1 + y), we deduce the inequality\ny \u2212 y 2/2 < ln(1 + y) < y \u2212 y 2/2 + y 3/3,\n\nwhere y > 0, and then we get ln(1 + x \u2212 x2 ) < x \u2212 3x2 /2 + 4x3 /3 \u2212 3x4 /2 + x5 \u2212 x6 /3 < x \u2212\n3x2 /2+4x3 /3. Since \u2212 ln(1\u2212x2 ) > x2 , we have p\u22121 < x\u22121 \u22123/2+4x/3 \u2264 x\u22121 \u22123/2+4/3p.\nSo x\u22121 > p + 1/2 \u2212 4/3p = p + 1/2 + o(1) as p \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\f10\n\nJOS\u00c9 BURILLO AND VICTOR GUBA\n\nNow we want to show that x\u22121 < p + 1/2. We have ln(1 + x \u2212 x2 ) > x \u2212 x2 \u2212 (x \u2212 x2 )2 /2 =\nx \u2212 3x2 /2 + x3 \u2212 x4 /2 and \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 x2 ) = x2 + x4 /2 + x6 /3 + * * * < x2 + x4 (1 + x2 +\nx4 + * * * )/2 = x2 + x4 /(2 \u2212 2x2 ) \u2264 x2 + 2x4 /3 because x \u2264 1/p \u2264 1/2. This gives\np \u2212 1 > (x \u2212 3x2 /2 + x3 \u2212 x4 /2)/(x2 + 2x4 /3) = (1 \u2212 3x/2 + x2 \u2212 x3 /2)/(x + 2x3 /3).\nFinally,\n1 \u2212 3x/2 + x2 \u2212 x3 /2\n1 9 \u2212 2x + 3x3\np\u22121>\n=\n\u2212\n> 1/x \u2212 3/2\nx + 2x3 /3\nx\n2(3 + 2x2 )\nsince 3x2 \u2212 6x \u2212 2 < 0 on [0; 1]. This gives x\u22121 < p + 1/2, as desired. So we get the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 4.4. The growth rate of the monoid F+ (p) of positive elements in the group\nF (p) generated by x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 is a number \u03b6p , which is the root of equation\n(y 2 \u2212 1)p\u22121 (y 2 + y \u2212 1) = y 2p .\n\nThis number has the form \u03b6p = p + \u03bbp , where 0 < \u03bbp < 1/2 for all p and \u03bbp \u2192 1/2 as\np \u2192 \u221e.\nIndeed, we proved inequalities p + 1/2 \u2212 4/3p < x\u22121 < p + 1/2, where x is the solution of\n(9). The inequality x\u22121 > p obviously follows for p \u2265 3; if p = 2, then it is known from\n[7] that \u03b62 > 2.24.\nThe equation in the statement of Theorem 4.4 is equivalent to (9) via the substitution\ny = 1/x. Notice that x and y are roots of polynomials of degree 2p \u2212 1 with integer\ncoefficients. Also let us mention without proof that \u03bbp is strictly increasing with respect\nto p.\nThe number \u03b6p gives a lower bound for the growth rate of the group F (p). However, this\nestimate can be essentially improved.\n5. New normal forms for elements of F (p)\nWe are going to find two new normal forms for elements of F (p). They will be analogs of\nthe normal forms constructed in [18] for the case F = F (2).\nThe first of these normal forms will involve the infinite set of generators \u03a3 = { xi (i \u2265 0) }.\nConsider the following rewriting system \u0393 = \u0393(p) over the alphabet \u03a3\u00b11 = \u03a3 \u222a \u03a3\u22121 (basic\nfacts about rewriting systems can be found in [2, 10]):\n(1) x\u03b5i x\u2212\u03b5\ni \u2192 1 (i \u2265 0, \u03b5 = \u00b11)\n(2) x\u03b5j xi \u2192 xi x\u03b5j+p\u22121 (j > i, \u03b5 = \u00b11)\n\u22121 \u03b5\n(3) x\u03b5j+p\u22121 x\u22121\n(j > i, \u03b5 = \u00b11)\ni \u2192 xi xj\nNotice that for every rewriting rule of \u0393, the left hand side and the right hand side are\nequal in F (p).\nIt is easy to see that \u0393 is terminating, that is, for every word w, the process of applying\nrewriting rules to w always terminates. Indeed, \u0393 either decreases the length of a word or\nit preserves the length. In the second case, if we make a vector that consists of subscripts\nof a word, the rewriting rules will decrease this vector lexicographically.\nSince \u0393 is terminating, applying the rewriting rules to a word w gives us a word v that\ncannot be reduced (that is, no more rewriting rules can be applied to v). We say that v\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n11\n\nis an irreducible form of w. Now we are going to check that \u0393 is also confluent, that is,\nevery word has a unique irreducible form. To do that, we apply the Diamond Lemma. In\nour case, this means that if we have rewriting rules of the form ab \u2192 u, bc \u2192 v, where a,\nb, c, d are letters and u, v are words, then uc and av have a common descendant. There\nare only finitely many cases to check, and all of them are easy. We will show one of these\ncases, the rest is left to the reader.\n\u22121 \u03b5\n\u22121\n\u22121\nLet us take the rewriting rules x\u03b5k+p\u22121x\u22121\nj \u2192 xj xk and xj xi \u2192 xi xj+p\u22121 , where k > j >\ni, \u03b5 = \u00b11. We have:\n\nand\n\n\u03b5\n\u22121\n\u03b5\n\u22121\n\u03b5\nx\u22121\nj xk xi \u2192 xj xi xk+p\u22121 \u2192 xi xj+p\u22121 xk+p\u22121\n\n\u03b5\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b5\nx\u03b5k+p\u22121 xi x\u22121\nj+p\u22121 \u2192 xi xk+2p\u22122 xj\u2212p\u22121 \u2192 xi xj+p\u22121 xk+p\u22121 .\nSo the words have a common descendant.\n\nNow we know that \u0393 is complete, that is, terminating and confluent. Therefore, each\nelement of F (p) can be uniquely represented by an irreducible word. So we have proved\nthe following\nTheorem 5.1. Each element g \u2208 F (p) can be uniquely represented as a word of the form\nN(g) = x\u03b5i11 x\u03b5i22 * * * x\u03b5imm ,\n\nwhere m \u2265 0, \u03b51 , \u03b52, . . . , \u03b5m = \u00b11, and for every 1 \u2264 k < m one of the following conditions\nholds:\n\u2022 ik < ik+1\n\u2022 ik = ik+1 and \u03b5k = \u03b5k+1\n\u2022 0 < ik \u2212 ik+1 < p and \u03b5k+1 = \u22121.\nIndeed, the conditions listed in the statement exactly mean that the word N(g) is irreducible, that is, it has no subwords that are left hand sides of the rewriting rules of \u0393.\nThe set of these irreducible words over \u03a3\u00b11 will be denoted by Ninf .\nNotice that the set Ninf has the following property: a word belongs to Ninf if and only if\nall its subwords of length 2 belong to Ninf . That is, the normal form of Theorem 5.1 is\nlocally testable.\nNow we will construct another normal form for elements of F (p). Now all words will\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\ninvolve only the finite set of generators x\u00b11\n0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 . Moreover, these normal forms\nwill give a regular language closed under taking subwords. Notice that this gives a regular\nspanning tree in the Cayley graph of F (p) in the above generators. As in [18] for the case\np = 2, this tree is not geodesic.\nIt is possible to write down a new rewriting system in order to get the normal form we\nwish to construct. However, it will take too much effort to prove that the rewriting system\nijs complete. We choose an approach that differs from [18].\nLet j \u2265 1. Then j can be uniquely expressed in the form j = r + d(p \u2212 1), where\nd\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 p \u2212 1, d \u2265 0. In this case xj equals in F (p) to the word x\u2212d\n0 xr x0 . For any\nd\nword w over \u03a3\u00b11 , replace each letter of the form x\u03b5j (j \u2265 1, \u03b5 = \u00b11) by x\u2212d\n0 xr x0 , where\nj = r + d(p \u2212 1), 1 \u2264 r \u2264 p \u2212 1, d \u2265 0 and then freely reduce all subwords of the form\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nx\u03b50 x\u2212\u03b5\n0 (\u03b5 = \u00b11).

The set of words in\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n{ x\u00b11\n0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 } without forbidden subwords will be denoted by Nfin .\nProof. Let w \u2208 Ninf have the form\n\nk\n\nw = xk00 xl\u03b111 xk01 xl\u03b122 * * * x0h\u22121 xl\u03b1hh xk0h ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere h \u2265 0, \u03b1i = ri + di (p \u2212 1), 1 \u2264 ri \u2264 p \u2212 1, di \u2265 0, li 6= 0 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 h. By\ndefinition,\n(11)\n\nd\n\nw\u0304 = x0k0 \u2212d1 xlr11 x0d1 +k1 \u2212d2 xlr22 * * * x0h\u22121\n\n+kh\u22121 \u2212dh lh dh +kh\nxrh x0\n.\n\nSuppose that w\u0304 is not freely irreducible. Then there exist an i from 1 to h \u2212 1 such that\ndi + ki \u2212 di+1 = 0, ri = ri+1 , and and li li+1 < 0. By definition, words from Ninf have no\n\u00b11 \u22121\nsubwords of the form x\u00b11\nj x0 for j > 0 and also have no subwords of the form xj x0 for\nj \u2265 p. This implies ki \u2264 0.\nSuppose that ki < 0. Then di = 0 (otherwise \u03b1i \u2265 p). Since di+1 \u2265 0, we obtain\ndi + ki \u2212 di+1 = ki \u2212 di+1 < 0. This is a contradiction. Therefore, ki = 0 and so di = di+1 .\nThis implies \u03b1i = ri + di (p \u2212 1) = ri+1 + di+1(p \u2212 1) = \u03b1i+1 . Thus the word w is not freely\nirreducible since li li+1 < 0. We have a contradiction. This proves that w\u0304 has no subwords\nof the form 1).\nd +k \u2212d\n\ni\ni\ni+1 \u00b11\nxri+1 be such\nSuppose that w\u0304 has a subword of one of the forms 2) \u2013 5). Let x\u00b11\nri x0\na subword, where 1 \u2264 i < h. As above, ki \u2264 0. Suppose that ki 6= 0. This implies di = 0\nand di + ki \u2212 di+1 < 0. But none of the words 2) \u2013 5) can contain x\u22121\n0 . This allows us to\n\u00b11 di \u2212di+1 \u00b11\nxri+1 as a subword.\nconclude that ki = 0 and w\u0304 contains v = xri x0\n\nSuppose that v satisfies condition 2). This means that di \u2265 di+1 , ri > ri+1 , li+1 > 0.\nHence w contains x\u00b11\n\u03b1i x\u03b1i+1 , where \u03b1i = ri + di (p \u2212 1) > ri+1 + di+1 (p \u2212 1). So w does not\nbelong to Ninf , which is impossible.\nSuppose that v satisfies condition 3). Now di \u2212 di+1 \u2265 1, ri > ri+1 , li+1 < 0. This leads\nto \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1i+1 = (ri \u2212 ri+1 ) + (di \u2212 di+1 )(p \u2212 1) \u2265 p, which also contradicts w \u2208 Ninf .\nSuppose that v satisfies condition 4). Then di \u2212 di+1 \u2265 1, ri \u2264 ri+1 , li+1 > 0. Now\nri \u2212 ri+1 \u2265 1 \u2212 (p \u2212 1) = 2 \u2212 p and so \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1i+1 = (ri \u2212 ri+1 ) + (di \u2212 di+1 )(p \u2212 1) \u2265\n(p \u2212 1) + (2 \u2212 p) > 0. Thus w contains x\u00b11\n\u03b1i x\u03b1i+1 with \u03b1i > \u03b1i+1 . This cannot happen by\ndefinition of Ninf .\nFinally, suppose that v satisfies condition 5). Now we have di \u2212di+1 \u2265 2 and so \u03b1i \u2212\u03b1i+1 =\n(ri \u2212 ri+1 ) + (di \u2212 di+1 )(p \u2212 1) \u2265 2(p \u2212 1) + (2 \u2212 p) = p. However, it should be \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1i+1 < p\nbecause w \u2208 Ninf .\nThe proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n13\n\nFor every g \u2208 F (p), we have the word N(g) \u2208 Nfin that represents g. We will prove that\ng is represented uniquely by a word from Nfin . This will follow from\nLemma 5.3. The mapping w 7\u2192 w\u0304 from Ninf to Nfin is a bijection.\nProof. We prove first that the mapping w 7\u2192 w\u0304 from Ninf to Nfin is injective. As above, let\nw \u2208 Ninf have the form (10). Thus w\u0304 equals (11). Suppose that we know the word w\u0304, that\nis, we know the numbers m0 = k0 \u2212 d1 , m1 = d1 + k1 \u2212 d2 , . . . , mh\u22121 = dh\u22121 + kh\u22121 \u2212 dh ,\nmh = kh + dh . Our aim is to recover the numbers k0 , d1 , k1 , . . . , dh\u22121 , kh\u22121 , dh , kh .\nLet h \u2265 1. It follows from the definition of Ninf that kh \u2264 0. Moreover, either kh < 0\nand dh = 0, or kh = 0. In the first case mh = kh + dh = kh < 0, in the second case\nmh = kh + dh = dh \u2265 0. Since we know mh , we can distinguish between these two cases.\nNamely, if mh < 0, then dh = 0, kh = mh . If mh \u2265 0, then kh = 0, dh = mh . Now we\nknow dh and kh .\nIf h \u2265 2, then kh\u22121 \u2264 0. As above, we have one of the two cases: kh\u22121 < 0, dh\u22121 = 0,\nor kh\u22121 = 0. The number kh\u22121 + dh\u22121 is negative in the first case and nonnegative in\nthe second case. But this number equals mh\u22121 + dh , so we know it and thus we are able\nto distinguish these cases. In the first case we have dh\u22121 = 0, kh\u22121 = mh\u22121 + dh ; in the\nsecond case - kh\u22121 = 0, dh\u22121 = mh\u22121 + dh . Therefore, we know dh\u22121 and kh\u22121 .\nContinuing in this way, we get the values of dh\u22122 , kh\u22122 , . . . , d1 , k1 . At the final step we\nget k0 = m0 + d1 .\nNow we show that the mapping is surjective. We start with a word from Nfin . This word\nhas the form\nm\n\nh\u22121 lh mh\n0 l1 m1 l2\nxrh x0 .\nxm\n0 xr1 x0 xr2 * * * x0\n\n(12)\n\nUsing the rules described in the first part of the proof, we define the numbers k0 , d1 , k1 ,\n. . . , dh , kh . It follows that di \u2265 0 for all i from 1 to h. So we can form a word w as in\n(10), where \u03b1i = ri + di (p \u2212 1) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 h). It is obvious that w\u0304 equals the word (12). It\nremains to prove that w belongs to Ninf .\n\nLet us assume the contrary. Since w has no subwords of the form x\u03b50 x\u2212\u03b5\n0 , it should contain\none of the following subwords:\na) x\u03b5i x\u2212\u03b5\ni\nb) x\u00b11\nj xi\n\n(i \u2265 1, \u03b5 = \u00b11);\n(j > i);\n\n\u22121\nc) x\u00b11\nj+p\u22121 xi\n\n(j > i).\n\nIn case a), w\u0304 will contain a forbidden subword of the form x\u03b5r x\u2212\u03b5\nr . Notice that ki \u2264 0 for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 h; if ki < 0, then di = 0. This means that in cases b) and c) one has i \u2265 1.\nLet j = \u03b1 + d(p \u2212 1), i = \u03b2 + d\u2032 (p \u2212 1), where 1 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 r \u2212 1, d, d\u2032 \u2265 0. Applying the\nd\u2212d\u2032\nx\u03b2 in case b)\n\"bar\" mapping to b) and c), we see that the word w\u0304 contains u = x\u00b11\n\u03b1 x0\nd\u2212d\u2032 +1 \u22121\n\u2032\nand v = x\u00b11\nx\nx\nin\ncase\nc).\nSince\nj\n>\ni,\nwe\nhave\n(d\n\u2212\nd\n)(p\n\u2212\n1)\n>\n\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n> \u2212(p \u2212 1).\n\u03b1\n0\n\u03b2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHence d \u2212 d \u2265 0. If u is not forbidden, then \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2. But in this case d \u2212 d > 0 so u has\nto be forbidden anyway. If v is not forbidden, then we also have \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2, which implies\nd \u2212 d\u2032 + 1 \u2265 2. We have a final contradiction.\nThe proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nJOS\u00c9 BURILLO AND VICTOR GUBA\n\nFrom Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 we obtain\nTheorem 5.4. Each element g \u2208 F (p) can be uniquely represented by a word w \u2208 Nfin .\n\u00b11\n\u22121\nThis means that for every g \u2208 F (p) there is exactly one word over { x\u00b11\n0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 }\nthat represents g and has no forbidden subwords. This gives a regular set of normal forms\nfor the group F (p).\nIndeed, the set of forbidden subwords is a regular language. So the set Nfin of words that\ndo not contain forbidden subwords will be also regular. Throughout the rest of the paper,\nwe will denote this language by Lp . (For basic properties of regular languages see [21].)\n6. Lower bounds for the growth rates of F (p)\n\u221a\nA lower bound of (3 + 5)/2 = 2.618 . . . for the growth rate of F = F (2) was obtained by\nthe second author in [15]. Now we will find a similar lower bound for each F (p). In the\nprevious section, we constructed a regular language Lp of normal forms for F (p). Each\nword of length n in Lp is at a distance at most n from the identity in the Cayley graph of\nF (p). So the growth function of Lp does not exceed the number of elements in the ball of\nradius n for F (p). Then, finding the growth function and the growth rate of Lp , we find\na lower bound for the growth rate of the group F (p).\nAn automaton to recognize the language Lp has 3p + 1 states. However, it is easier to\nconstruct a directed graph with only 2p + 1 vertices (states). This graph will be denoted\nby Ap and we will also call it an automaton although its edges have no labels. The\ndescription of Ap is as follows.\nThe vertices (states) of Ap are denoted by q, q0 , q1 , . . . , qp\u22121 , q1,0 , q2,0 , . . . , qp\u22121,0 , q\u0304. They\nwill correspond to the following partition of Lp into disjoint subsets:\n\u2022 The set { 1 } that consists of the empty word (state q).\n\u2022 The set of words that end with x\u00b11\n0 and do not have a terminal segment of the\n\u00b11 k\nform xi x0 , where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, k \u2265 1 (state q0 ).\n\u2022 The set of words that end with x\u00b11\n(state qi for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1).\ni\n\u00b11\n\u2022 The set of words that end with xi x0 (state qi,0 for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1).\nk\n\u2022 The set of words that end with x\u00b11\ni x0 for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1 and k \u2265 2 (state q\u0304).\nLet w \u2208 Lp . If w is empty, then wx\u00b11\nwill be in Lp for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1. We draw two\ni\narrows from q to qi for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1.\nLet w correspond to the state q0 . Then w = vx\u03b50 for some word v and for some \u03b5 = \u00b11.\nThe word wx\u03b50 will be in Lp ; for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1 the word wx\u00b11\nwill be also in Lp since\ni\nk\nw has no terminal segments of the form x\u00b11\nx\n(1\n\u2264\ni\n\u2264\np\n\u2212\n1,\nk\n\u2265\n1. Thus we draw an\n0\ni\narrow from q0 to itself and two arrows from q0 to each qi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1).\n\nLet w correspond to qi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1). The words wx\u22121\n0 and wx0 belong to Lp ; we draw\nan arrow from qi to q0 and an arrow from qi to qi,0 . The words wxj belong to Lp whenever\ni < j \u2264 p \u2212 1; the words wx\u22121\nj belong to Lp for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p \u2212 1. So we draw one arrow\nfrom qi to each q1 , . . . , qi and two arrows from qi to each qi+1 , . . . , qp\u22121 .\nLet w correspond to qi,0 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1). The word wx0 is in Lp and we draw an arrow\nfrom qi,0 to q\u0304. Also wx\u22121\nj \u2208 Lp whenever i \u2264 j \u2264 p \u2212 1. So one arrow goes from qi,0 to\neach qi , . . . , qp\u22121 . No other arrows can appear.\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n15\n\nFinally, let w correspond to q\u0304. Now only wx0 leads to a word in Lp ; it corresponds to an\narrow from q\u0304 to itself.\nThe description of Ap is complete. Notice that the number of words in Lp of length n is\nexactly the number of (directed) paths of length n in Ap starting at q. We would like to\ncompute the number of paths in Ap of length n starting at q and ending at a given state.\nFor each state we consider the corresponding\ngenerating function. Namely, to each vertex\nP\u221e\nn\nv we assign a series of the form n=0 an t , where an is the number of paths in Ap starting\nat q and ending at v. These generating functions will be denoted by f , fi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1),\nfi,0 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1), f \u0304 for each of the states, respectively. We will write down a system of\nequations for these functions.\nFirst of all, it is clear that f (t) = 1. To find f0 , we mention that two arrows go from q\ninto q0 and one arrow goes into q0 from each of the states q0 , q1 , . . . , qp\u22121 . Hence\nf0 = t(2f + f0 + f1 + * * * + fp\u22121 ).\n\n(13)\n\nGiven a vertex qi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1), we observe that two arrows go into qi from q, q0 , . . . ,\nqi\u22121 and one arrow from qi , . . . , qp\u22121 . Also one arrow goes into qi from each q1,0 , . . . , qi,0 .\nThus\nfi = t(2f + 2f0 + * * * + 2fi\u22121 + fi + * * * + fp\u22121 ) + t(f1,0 + * * * + fi,0 ).\n\n(14)\n\nNotice that fi,0 = tfi for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1 because only one arrow goes into qi,0 (from\nthe state qi ). Thus we can rewrite (14) as follows:\nfi = t(2f + 2f0 + * * * + 2fi\u22121 + fi + * * * + fp\u22121 ) + t2 (f1 + * * * + fi ).\n\n(15)\n\nFinally, there is one arrow that goes into q\u0304 from each of the states q1,0 , . . . , qp\u22121,0 , q\u0304. So\n(16)\nf \u0304 = t(f1,0 + * * * + fp\u22121,0 + f \u0304) = t2 (f1 + * * * + fp\u22121 ) + tf \u0304.\nIn order to solve the system, let us consider the difference of equation (15) with i = 1 and\n(13). This gives f1 \u2212 f0 = tf0 + t2 f1 , that is, (1 \u2212 t2 )f1 = (1 + t)f0 . So f0 = (1 \u2212 t)f1 .\nNow suppose that 1 \u2264 i < p \u2212 1. If we take the difference between fi+1 and fi using (15),\nwe obtain fi+1 \u2212 fi = tfi + t2 fi+1 , which implies fi = (1 \u2212 t)fi+1 .\nNow for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1 one has fi = (1 \u2212 t)p\u22121\u2212i fp\u22121 . The equation (13) becomes\n\n(1 \u2212 t)p\u22121 fp\u22121 = 2t + tfp\u22121 ((1 \u2212 t)p\u22121 + * * * + (1 \u2212 t) + 1) = 2t + fp\u22121 (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)p ).\n\nThis gives\n(17)\n\nfp\u22121 (t) =\n\n(1 \u2212\n\nt)p\n\n2t\n.\n+ (1 \u2212 t)p\u22121 \u2212 1\n\nIn order to find the number of words in Lp having length n, we need to add all the\ngenerating functions for all states. The result will be\n\u03a6p (t) = 1 + f0 + f1 + * * * + fp\u22121 + t(f1 + * * * + fp\u22121 ) +\n(here we used (16) to express f \u0304).

Notice that 0 < x < 1.\nSince (1 + x)p < 3, the root x approaches 0 as p goes to infinity.\nThe equation (1 + x)p = 2 + x can be written as\np=\nTherefore,\n(19)\nas p \u2192 \u221e.\n\nln(2 + x)\nln 2 + ln(1 + x/2)\nln 2 + x/2 + o(x)\n=\n=\n.\nln(1 + x)\nln(1 + x)\nx \u2212 x2 /2 + o(x2 )\n\np \u2212 21\n1 + o(x)\n1\n=\n= x\u22121 (1 + x/2 + o(x)) = x\u22121 + + o(1)\n2\n2\nln 2\nx \u2212 x + ox\n2\n\nWe are interested in the number \u03bep = t\u22121 , where t is the root of (1\u2212t)p +(1\u2212t)p\u22121 \u22121 = 0.\nHere (1 \u2212 t)\u22121 = y, where y = 1 + x is the root of y p = y + 1. It is easy to see that\n\u03bep = 1 + x\u22121 . So we deduce from (19) that\np \u2212 12\n1\n+ + o(1), p \u2192 \u221e.\nln 2\n2\n\u22121\nIt is also easy to see that \u03bep = t satisfies the following equation: (2\u03be \u2212 1)(\u03be \u2212 1)p\u22121 = \u03be p .\nSo we proved\n\u03bep =\n\nTheorem 6.1. The growth rate of the group F (p), p \u2265 2 has a lower bound of \u03bep , where\n\u03bep satisfies the equation\n(2\u03be \u2212 1)(\u03be \u2212 1)p\u22121 = \u03be p .\nThe following asymptotic formula holds:\n\u03bep =\n\np \u2212 12\n1\n+ + o(1),\nln 2\n2\n\np \u2192 \u221e.\n\nHere are several numerical values of \u03bep :\n\u03be2 = 2.618033989\n\u03be3 = 4.079595623\n\u03be4 = 5.530132718\n\u03be5 = 6.977144180\nand so on. For large values of p, the growth rate of F (p) is at least 0.72(2p \u2212 1) (recall\nthat 2p \u2212 1 is the maximum value of the growth rate of a p-generated group; this happens\nif and only if the group is free of rank p).\n\n\fGROWTH OF POSITIVE WORDS AND LOWER BOUNDS OF THE GROWTH RATE FOR THOMPSON'S GROUPS F (p)\n17\n\nIt would be interesting to find nontrivial upper bounds for the growth rates of F (p). This\nmeans to find a constant c < 1 such that the growth rate of F (p) in its natural generators\ndoes not exceed c(2p \u2212 1).\nReferences\n[1] J. M. Belk, K. S. Brown.
