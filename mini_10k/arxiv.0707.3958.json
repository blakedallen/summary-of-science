Introduction\nA central idea in physics is that complex, often intractable, behavior can be quantified\nby a few measurable control parameters. In fluid turbulence a single control parameter,\nthe Reynolds number RE quantifies the transition from ordered (laminar) to disordered\n(turbulent) flow. This parameter is from dimensional arguments a function of\nmacroscopic system variables, but is also expressible as a function of the number\nof energy carrying modes or degrees of freedom (d.o.f.)[1]. Although the detailed\ndynamics are different, many of the macroscopic features of idealized, finite (large)\nReynolds number turbulence are also characteristic of other strongly correlated, out\nof equilibrium systems. These systems can all be driven into a disordered state with\ndefining characteristics: they have many degrees of freedom (d.o.f.); are driven and\ndissipating, are out of equilibrium but on average in a steady state, and show anomalous\nscaling over a large dynamic range. Loosely speaking, a 'class' of such systems will show\nan order- disorder transition, captured by varying a single control parameter. This\nincludes avalanche models exhibiting Self Organized Criticality (SOC)[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\nIt was originally argued[2, 21] that these systems self organize to an SOC state which in\nthe above sense is their state of maximal disorder. Subsequent analysis has established\na consensus[11, 12, 13, 6, 5] that SOC is a limiting behavior in the driving rate h and the\ndissipation rate \u01eb, such that h/\u01eb \u2192 0 with h,\u01eb \u2192 0, (and h \u2264 \u01eb, that is, steady state).\nThis is exemplified by the constructive definition (in[4]) as \"slowly driven interaction\ndominated thresholded\" (SDIDT) systems.\nIn this paper we give a prescription for obtaining a control parameter for these\nsystems, in analogy to the Reynolds number in fluid turbulence. For avalanche models\nexhibiting SOC, we identify d.o.f. with realizable avalanche sizes and we show that the\nrelevant control parameter RA is h/\u01eb. It follows that the SDIDT limit is reached by\ntaking RA to zero; we show this maximizes the number of d.o.f. in the opposite sense to\nfluid turbulence. This result clarifies the much debated relationship between turbulence\nand SOC[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. An important corollary is that SOC phenomenology can\nquite generally persist under conditions of finite drive in a sufficiently large bandwidth\nsystem. As our result flows from dimensional analysis it is quite generic. An important\nexample that we give here is as a parametrization of ecosystem models for species\nabundance[8, 9, 10]. For ecosystems we show that as the control parameter increases so\ndoes the abundance of species, or d.o.f. This points to the possibility of a critical value\nat which the onset of diversification of species occurs.\n2. Similarity analysis and Reynolds number\nThe systems that we have in mind all have strongly coupled d.o.f. that transport\nsome quantity from the driving to the dissipation scale. Provided that this 'dynamical\nquantity' is governed by a conservation law to ensure steady state (not necessarily\nequilibrium) on the average we insist that its precise nature, and the microscopic\n\n\f3\n\nControl parameters\nTable 1. \u03a0 theorem applied to homogeneous turbulence.\n\nVariable dimension\nL0\nL\n\u03b7\nL\nU\nLT \u22121\n\u03bd\nL2 T \u22121\n\ndescription\ndriving length scale\ndissipation length scale\nbulk (driving) flow speed\nviscosity\n\ndetails of how it is transported are not relevant to the macroscopic ensemble average\nbehavior. We seek a control parameter expressible in terms of the number of d.o.f. of\nthe system that parameterizes the transition from ordered (few d.o.f.) to disordered\n(many d.o.f.) behavior. We identify the control parameters of the system in terms\nof known macroscopic variables by formal dimensional analysis (similarity analysis\nor Buckingham \u03a0 theorem, see e.g. [20]). Any system's behavior is captured by a\ngeneral function F which only depends on the relevant variables Q1..V that describe the\nsystem. Since F is dimensionless it must be a function of the possible dimensionless\ngroupings \u03a01..M (Q1..V ) which can be formed from the Q1..V . The (unknown) function\nF (\u03a01 , \u03a02 , ..\u03a0M ) is universal, describing all systems that depend on the Q1..V through the\n\u03a01..M (Q1..V ) and the relationships between them. If one then has additional information\nabout the system, such as a conserved quantity, the \u03a01..M (Q1..V ) can be related to each\nother to make F explicit. Thus this method can lead to information about the solution of\na class of systems where the governing equations are unavailable or intractable, often the\ncase for complex systems where there are a large number (N here) of strongly coupled\nd.o.f.. If the V variables are expressed in W dimensions (i.e. mass, length, time) then\nthere are M = V \u2212 W dimensionless groupings.\nHere, since we have that the precise nature of the transported dynamical quantity\nis irrelevant, the only relevant dimensions are length and time so that W = 2. We next\ninsist that there is a single control parameter (R, in the case of turbulence, the Reynolds\nnumber RE ) which may be expressed as a function of the number of active degrees of\nfreedom N. This means that the system's behaviour is captured by some F (\u03a01 , \u03a02 );\nwhere R = \u03a01 and \u03a02 = f (N) and the \u03a01 and \u03a02 are related via some conservation\nproperty. Hence M = 2 so that V = 4; there are four relevant variables to consider.\nIt is useful to fix ideas in terms of a relatively well understood example of the above,\nnamely turbulence. Our aim here is to obtain a control parameter R by analogy to RE\nvia dimensional analysis; for a detailed discussion of the universal scaling properties of\nKolmogorov (K-41) turbulence and their origin in the Navier Stokes equations see for\nexample [1]. As above, for K-41 we have four relevant macroscopic variables (given in\nTable 1) and two dimensionless groups:\nL0\nUL0\n= RE , \u03a02 =\n= f (N)\n(1)\n\u03bd\n\u03b7\n\u03a01 is the Reynolds number of the flow, and the ratio of lengthscales \u03a02 is directly\n\u03a01 =\n\n\f4\n\nControl parameters\n\nrelated to the number of d.o.f. N available and we now relate RE to f (N) (or \u03a01 to\n\u03a02 ). For incompressible fluid turbulence, our dynamical quantity is the time rate of\nenergy transfer per unit mass \u03b5l through length scale l. Conservation and steady state\nimply that in an ensemble averaged sense this is balanced by the rate at which energy\nis transferred to the fluid \u03b5inj \u223c U 3 /L0 which in turn is balanced by the dissipation of\nenergy within the fluid \u03b5diss so that \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5l \u223c \u03b5diss . Dimensional arguments (e.g. [1])\nlead to \u03b5diss \u223c \u03bd 3 /\u03b7 4 . Conservation, that is \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5diss then gives the well known result\n[1] which relates \u03a01 and \u03a02 :\nUL0\n\u223c\nRE =\n\u03bd\n\nL0\n\u03b7\n\n!4\n3\n\n(2)\n\nThe 4/3 exponent that arises for K-41 is modified if we consider other turbulent\nflows with different phenomenologies, for example anisotropy, and intermittency.\nNevertheless, for any turbulent flow we can anticipate that the relationship between\nL0 /\u03b7 and the number of degrees of freedom N will be of the form:\nN\u223c\n\nL0\n\u03b7\n\n!\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03b1 > 0; the crucial point is that for turbulence, N always grows with L0 /\u03b7. The\nonly property of turbulence with which we are concerned here is that\nRE \u223c\n\nL0\n\u03b7\n\n!\u03b2\n\n\u223c N \u03b2N\n\n(4)\n\nand that in particular, for turbulence \u03b2N = \u03b2\u03b1 > 0. This identifies the Reynolds\nnumber as the control parameter for a process (turbulence) which simply grows more\nactive modes or d.o.f. as we increase RE , taking the system from order (few d.o.f. or\nlaminar flow) to disorder (many coupled d.o.f.).\nWe will now see that more generally, similarity analysis is sufficient to obtain the\nrelationship between the control parameter R and the number of degrees of freedom N\nof the form:\nR \u223c N \u03b2N\n\n(5)\n\nThe value of the exponent \u03b2N will depend on the details of these systems but crucially\nwe will see that the sign of \u03b2N is obtained from similarity analysis. This is sufficient to\nestablish if, as in the case of turbulence, increasing R increases the disorder or complexity\nof the system.\n3. Control parameter for avalanching systems\nWe now envisage a generic avalanche model in a system of size L0 where the height\nof sand is specified on a grid, with nodes at spacing \u03b4l. Sand is added to individual\nnodes, that is, on length scale \u03b4l at an average time rate \u03b5inj = h per node. There\nis some process, here avalanches, which then transports this dynamical quantity (the\nsand) though structures on intermediate length scales \u03b4l < l < L0 . Sand is then lost to\n\n\f5\n\nControl parameters\n\nTable 2. \u03a0 theorem applied to an avalanching system. The sand carries a property\nwith dimension S.\n\nVariable\nL0\n\u03b4l\n\u01eb\nh\n\ndimension\nL\nL\nST \u22121\nST \u22121\n\ndescription\nsystem size\ngrid size\nsystem average dissipation/loss rate\naverage driving rate per node\n\nthe system (dissipated) at a time rate \u01eb over the system size L0 . The relevant variables\nfor the avalanching system are given in Table 2. The two dimensionless groups are:\nL0\nh\n= f (N)\n(6)\n\u03a01 = = RA , \u03a02 =\n\u01eb\n\u03b4l\nThe second parameter, \u03a02 = f (N) is related to the number of d.o.f. of the system. The\ncontrol parameter \u03a01 = h/\u01eb is analogous to the Reynolds number above in that, as we\nwill now show, it relates the ratio of the driving to the dissipation rates to the number\nof active, or energy containing degrees of freedom N in the system.\nIn Euclidean dimension D there are (L0 /\u03b4l)D nodes so that conservation[22, 23, 24]\nof the flux of sand (in an ensemble averaged sense), gives h(L0 /\u03b4l)D \u223c \u01eb which simply\nstates that the rate at which sand is added to the system must on average balance\nthe rate at which sand leaves. On intermediate length scales \u03b4l < l < L0 , sand is\ntransported via avalanches. There must be some detail of the internal evolution of\nthe pile that maximizes the number of length scales l on which avalanches occur. For\navalanche models this is the property that transport can only occur locally if some local\ncritical gradient is exceeded; as a consequence the pile evolves through many metastable\nstates. If these length scales represent d.o.f. then the number N of d.o.f. available will\nbe bounded by L0 and \u03b4l so that:\nN \u223c (L0 /\u03b4l)\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nwith D \u2265 \u03b1 \u2265 0 for D > 1 (\u03b1 may be fractional). We then have:\nh\nRA = \u223c\n\u01eb\n\n\u03b4l\nL0\n\n!D\n\n\u223c N \u2212\u03b1D\n\n(8)\n\nThis is in contrast to fluid turbulence since the number of d.o.f. decreases with increasing\ndrive, that is, increasing RA = h/\u01eb. Thus we recover the SDIDT limit for SOC, namely\nRA \u2192 0, but now explicitly identify this limit with maximizing the number of d.o.f.\navailable, that is, the disorder of the system. Our result from dimensional analysis is\nto obtain RA \u223c N \u03b2N and to show quite generally that \u03b2N < 0. Following the above\ndiscussion of turbulence, we can go further and make the analogy RA \u2261 RE , that is, the\nsystem's 'effective Reynolds number' increases with the energy/sand taken up by the\nsystem, i.e. with h.\nThe property that the system generates many coupled d.o.f. is, for SOC, captured\nby avalanching phenomenology. This sets conditions on the microscopic details of the\n\n\f6\n\nControl parameters\n\nsystem; specifically, there must be a separation of timescales in that the relaxation time\nfor the avalanches must be short compared to the time taken for the drive to on average\ncause a cell to be come unstable so that avalanching is the dominant mode of transport.\nThe critical gradient can be a random variable but provided it has a defined average value\ng, we have an average number of timesteps to drive a cell unstable (g\u03b4l)/(h\u03b4t) where \u03b4t\nis the timestep. This gives two conditions for avalanching to dominate transport[25]:\nL0 D\n(9)\nh\u03b4t \u226a g\u03b4l, h\u03b4t \u226a g\u03b4l\n\u03b4l\nThe first condition is that avalanches only occur after many grains of sand have been\nadded to any given cell in the pile and is the strict SDIDT[11, 12, 13] limit. However,\nif the system has large bandwidth L0 \u226b \u03b4l, one can consider an intermediate behavior\ngL0 \u226b h\u03b4t > g\u03b4l where the driver is large enough to swamp the smallest avalanches, but\nlarger avalanches persist[25]. For fixed L0 and \u03b4l, increasing h\u03b4t above g\u03b4l successively\nerodes the available d.o.f since each addition of sand swamps h\u03b4t/(g\u03b4l) cells of the pile.\nUltimately as h and hence RA is increased to the point where h\u03b4t \u223c g\u03b4l (L0 /\u03b4l)D there\nwill be a crossover to laminar flow.\nWe now show that this intermediate, finite RA behavior will be 'SOC like', with\npower law avalanche statistics sharing the same exponent as at the SDIDT limit;\nconfirming our assumption above that \u03b2N is independent of the control parameter RA .\nTo see this, consider passing through the regime of h\u03b4t \u223c g\u03b4l with h\u03b4t \u226a g\u03b4l (L0 /\u03b4l)D ,\nwhich can be achieved by increasing both h and L0 such that h \u2192 Ah and L0 \u2192\nL0 A(1/D) . This is equivalent to coarse graining the pile spatially, so that provided the\nsystem has self similar spatial scaling we can anticipate obtaining the same solution\n(subject to a rescaling) provided L0 \u2192 L0 A(1/D) . Under nonlocal feeding and non\noverlapping avalanches (A times as many grains added at well separated positions over\nthe pile) this coarse-graining may not occur.\nWe illustrate this in Figures 1 and 2 with simulations of the BTW[2] sandpile in\n2D, where the driving occurs randomly in time and is spatially restricted to the 'top' of\nthe pile. In all cases the critical gradient (threshold for avalanching) is g = 4. Figure 1\nshows two simulations of size L0 = 100 with h = [4, 16] (\u03b4t = 1 in the simulations) i.e.\njust at, and above, the regime h\u03b4t \u223c g\u03b4l, but in both cases with h\u03b4t \u226a g\u03b4l (L0 /\u03b4l)D . At\nh = 16 we see that the power law statistics of the smallest avalanches is lost but there is\nstill scaling over a more restricted range of avalanche sizes, i.e. we have the same scaling,\nand same exponent, but over a reduced number of d.o.f. Rescaling the avalanche sizes\nof the h = 16 run S \u2192 S/16 (that is, lengthscales l \u2192 l/4) recovers the behaviour of\nthe h = 4 run except at the largest decade. To recover the full range we repeat the\nh = 16 run in a larger box, L0 = 400 (that is, L0 \u2192 4L0 ) which is shown alongside\nthe h = 4, L0 = 100 run in Figure 2. Rescaling the L0 = 400 run with S \u2192 S/16, i.e.\nlengthscales l \u2192 l/4 then reproduces the h = 4, L0 = 100 results. This establishes\na general property of avalanching systems that has been seen in several representative\nSOC models[27, 25, 26, 28], see also [29, 30].\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\f7\n\nControl parameters\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\nP(S)\n\nP(S)\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\nS\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nS\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFigure 1.

One\ncan develop this idea to introduce \"running sandpiles\" (as extensively studied by, for\nexample, [29, 27, 28, 30]) where redistribution is no longer instantaneous. Instead,\nwherever the critical gradient is exceeded locally, f grains are moved in time \u03b4tf . Thus\nthere is a local redistribution rate per cell hf = f /\u03b4tf which we can compare with the\ndriving rate h. This introduces a new dimensionless parameter (h\u03b4tf )/(hf \u03b4t) which\nmodifies h in the discussion above; in other words the SDIDT limit is approached\nfor both h \u2192 0 and \u03b4tf /\u03b4t \u2192 0 [11, 12]. However, consistent with studies of running\nsandpiles [29, 27, 28, 30], we can anticipate that avalanching phenomenology will persist\nfor a range of finite \u03b4tf /\u03b4t.\n\n\f8\n\nControl parameters\n\nTable 3. \u03a0 theorem applied to a simple model for an ecosystem in a space with\nEuclidean dimension D.

One could argue (see also [11]) that such robustness\nagainst fluctuations in the driver is necessary for SOC to provide a 'working model' in\nreal physical systems where the idealized SDIDT limit may not be realized.\n4. Control parameter for model ecosystem\nFinally, we apply the above framework to simple models for ecosystems. We consider a\nlarge number of connected 'meta- species' (or groups of species/variations occupying a\ngiven niche[8]) with diverse sizes and rates of predation. Each meta- species is a d.o.f.\nin the model. We insist that the details are unimportant except that each of the N\nmeta- species, by acting as predator of one set of neighbors in the food web and prey to\nanother set, processes some dynamical quantity, say, biomass or energy. The ecosystem\nthen has a driving rate, or rate of supply H of biomass/energy per unit volume at the\n'bottom' of the web and a dissipation rate, or rate of consumption P of biomass by the\ntop predators. We consider a steady state on the average which includes secular change\nin these parameters that is slow compared to the timescale for information to propagate\nthrough the web. For a given habitat, the abundance of species (i.e the relative number\nof distinct meta- species) grows with the size of the habitat. Although the details may\nvary, a good working approximation for the 'species- area relationship'[32] is a power\nlaw, so that the number of species N in a habitat of size L0 is given by N \u223c (L20 )\u03b3 . A\ndimensionally balanced expression in D Euclidean dimensions is:\nN \u223c (L0 /Lc )D\u03b3\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b3 > 0. The length scale Lc captures details of the sampling, as well as specifics of\na given habitat and terrain. The relevant system variables are shown in Table 3. There\nare two dimensionless groups:\n1\nL0\nP\n= RB , \u03a02 =\n(11)\n= f (N) = N D\u03b3\n\u03a01 =\nD\nHLc\nLc\nthus we identify a control parameter \u03a01 = RB for the simple ecosystem. To relate\nthis to the abundance of species we require some conservation property and to insist on\n\n\fControl parameters\n\n9\n\nsteady state. One possibility is to conserve some fraction of the biomass flux propagated\nthrough the web so that for a steady state for the system as a whole, the rate of supply\nof biomass is balanced by the rate of removal by the top predators giving LD\n0 H \u223c P.\nIn a system with losses, provided a fraction \u03b1 of the propagated quantity is on average\npassed from one d.o.f. or species to the next, this expression is A\u03b1N LD\n0 H \u223c P ; the\nfactor A also includes any recycling of the top predator biomass to the bottom of the\nweb.\nWe can however work with any quantity which is transferred from one species to\nanother with some conservation. If we instead consider P and H to refer to integrated\nenergy consumption of the top predator population and the energy taken up by the\nweb per unit volume (the productivity) respectively, conservation is then the original\n'energetic- equivalence rule'[31]- that the total energy flux of a population is invariant\nwith respect to body size. The control parameter RB increases with a measure of the\nrate at which biomass (or energy) is utilized by the system as a whole (P ),that is, is\nultimately consumed by the top predator. Equivalently, it increases with the biomass (or\nenergy) rate of supply to the system via the organisms at the bottom of the web, HL0 ;\nthese both represent the rate at which biomass/energy is processed by the ecosystem as\na whole. We then have:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nL0 D\n\u223c N\u03b3\n(12)\nRB \u223c\nLc\nso we obtain that RB \u223c N \u03b2N and quite generally that \u03b2N > 0. The abundance of species\nsimply increases with RB capturing the observation that diversity grows with the global\nflux of energy/biomass, that is, productivity times area[31, 32]. This result holds even\nif the species- area relationship is not a power law, it simply requires that the number\nof species grows with habitat size; intriguingly, a non- power law \u03b2N suggests a length\nscale dependence in the abundance of species that is intermittent.\nThe power law dependence implied by a power law species-area relationship suggests\nthat the dependence of RB on N is rather nonlinear. A consequence is that, if we\nconsider slowly increasing this control parameter in a manner that does not violate\nour assumption of a steady state, we would expect, starting from an initial state of\nfew species, to see a sudden 'explosion' in diversity at some critical value RL . This\nwill depend on the details through the non universal parameter Lc ; but since Lc can\nbe determined through species- area abundance relationships, RL can in principle be\ndetermined.\nWe can consider the analogy RB \u2261 RE , that is, we identify RB as the ecosystem's\n'effective Reynolds number' which increases with the energy/biomass taken up by the\nsystem. We have then shown that, the disorder, or complexity of the ecosystem as\nexpressed by the abundance of species increases with effective Reynolds number in the\nsame sense as turbulence. This analogy to turbulence may be instructive in that there\nis some non universal value of the Reynolds number at which a given system makes the\ntransition to turbulence. One can speculate that dynamical systems routes to turbulence\n(specifically, the Ruelle-Takens or Feigenbaum scenarios, e.g. [33]) suggest a new\n\n\fControl parameters\n\n10\n\napproach to modelling the onset of the diversity of species. Understanding ecosystems\nin the context of simple models for turbulence may also provide a basis for modelling\nthe \"bursty\" dynamics and scaling intrinsic to some ecosystems[34]. Our approach to a\n'generalized Reynolds number' outlined here potentially has wider application: to living\norganisms and societal organizations, insofar as they can be modelled[8] as webs of many\ninteracting elements that process some dynamical quantity.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A.
