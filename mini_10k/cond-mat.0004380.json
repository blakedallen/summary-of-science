We find that the geometric properties of this network are\nsimilar to those of small-world networks, namely, the diameter of conformation space increases, for\nlarge networks, as the logarithm of the number of conformations, while locally the network appears\nto have low dimensionality.\n\nthe possibility of changing from one conformation to another, through a single Monte Carlo move of the chain,\nwith the existence of a link between the corresponding\nvertices (Fig. 1).\nOur study relies on two important simplifications. The\nfirst simplification is to use a lattice model. On this regard, note that due to the limited number of allowed equilibrium angles between two monomers, the modeling of a\npolymer by a linear chain on a lattice may be experimentally justified [11]. In fact, even for the study of proteins,\nlattice models led to important insights [10,11]. The second simplification is to neglect interactions. On this regard, note that here we are only interested in determining\nthe geometric and structural properties of conformation\nspace, and that interactions affect the rate of transfer\nbetween the allowed conformations [4,10,12]. Moreover,\nour results will also apply to any polymer chain in the\nlimit of very high temperature for which the monomer\ninteractions are mostly due to steric effects [13].\nWe first calculate the geometric properties of conformation space for the simplified lattice polymer model and\ncompare these properties with the predictions of several\nmodels for conformation space. This approach is different from the ones considered so far in the literature. We\ndo not start by postulating a particular type of structure\nwith some theoretically-desirable properties but, instead,\ntry to generate the full network describing conformation\nspace and compare its properties with different models.\nAs a first test, we study the dependence of the average shortest distance l between any two vertices in the\nnetwork on the number n of vertices. Note (i) that the\nsize of the network equals the number of allowed conformations of the chain, and (ii) that the distance between\ntwo vertices equals the minimum number of elementary\nmoves of the chain necessary to switch between the two\ncorresponding conformations. For a tree structure or a\nrandom network we expect a logarithmic increase of l\nwith n, while for a d-dimensional lattice we expect an algebraic increase: l \u223c n1/d . In contrast, for a small-world\nnetwork, l follows the scaling law [14]\n\nThe physical properties of polymers are the focus of a\nlot of attention due to (i) their role in many new advanced\nmaterials with important technologic applications [1],\nand (ii) their role in biological processes [2]. An especially\nimportant unsolved problem in polymer studies is protein\nfolding. Solving this problem has recently become more\nurgent as several studies suggest that a number of human\ndiseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and British\ndementia, may be due to the aggregation of misfolded\nproteins [3,4].\nThe kinetics of protein folding are controlled by the\nstructure of the free-energy landscape [5]. Theoretical\ncalculations predict that in some cases the barriers in the\nfree-energy landscape are quite small [6]. Hence, the diffusion of a protein's conformation on its energy landscape\nmay be determined mainly by the structure and connectivity of conformation space. For this reason, much work\nhas been done on the structure of conformation space and\nmany models have been proposed, including tree structures, random networks, and ultrametric spaces [7]. In\nspite of all this work, very little is known about the conformation space of polymers in general and proteins in\nparticular.\nHere, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis\nthat the conformation space of a lattice homopolymer\nchain may be a small-world network. These networks\n-which appear as the result of randomly replacing a\nfraction p of the links of a d-dimensional lattice with new\nrandom links [8]- interpolate between the two limiting\ncases of a regular lattice (p = 0) and a random graph\n(p = 1). The small-world regime is characterized by the\nproperties (i) that a local neighborhood is preserved -as\nfor regular lattices [8]- and (ii) that the average shortest\ndistance between two vertices increases logarithmically\nwith the number of vertices n of the network -as for\nrandom graphs [9].\nTo gain some insight on the conformation space of real\npolymers, we consider here the conformation space of a\n2-dimensional lattice polymer chain. To study the geometrical properties of conformation space, we map it\nonto a network [10]. We first enumerate all allowed conformations of the chain. We then identify (i) each conformation of the chain with a vertex of the network, and (ii)\n\nl(n, p) \u223c (n\u2217 )1/d f (n/n\u2217 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the scaling function f (u) has the limits f (u) \u223c\n1\n\n\fu1/d for u \u226a 1 and f (u) \u223c ln u for u \u226b 1; n\u2217 \u223c p\u22121 is a\ncrossover size that separates the large- and small-world\nregimes, and p is the fraction of \"rewired\" links [14]. Figure 2 displays our results for the polymer chain, which\nsuggest that the conformation space can be described by\na small-world network with p \u2248 10\u22123 . Figure 2 clearly\nrules out the possibility that, for n \u226b 1, the conformation\nspace is a low dimensionality lattice.\nAs a second test, we study the local structure of conformation space and compare it with that of a random\nnetwork [8]. To this end, we calculate the clustering coefficient C, which is defined as the average ratio of the\nnumber of existing links between neighbors of a vertex\nand the maximum number of possible links. For a random network [8], we expect C \u2243 z/n, where z is the\naverage connectivity of the network. In contrast, smallworld networks have values of C of the same order of\nmagnitude as those of regular lattices, because only a\nsmall percentage of links are different from those in the\nlattice [8]. In Fig. 3(a), we compare the values of C obtained for the networks with the values of C for random\nnetworks with the same size and connectivity. Clearly,\nthe measured clustering coefficients are much larger than\nthe expected values for random networks, ruling out a\npurely random structure for conformation space.\nAs a third test, we calculate the number of elementary loops in conformation space -usually referred to\nas the cyclomatic number [15]- and compare the results with those for a tree structure. For a tree structure\nthe cyclomatic number is identically zero while for all\nother networks it increases linearly with n. Figure 3(b)\nshows that the cyclomatic number for the polymer conformation space clearly increases with n, consistent with\na small-world network but ruling out a tree structure for\nconformation space.\nAs a final test, we calculate the percentage of\ntriplets {A, B, C} of vertices in conformation space whose\ndistances obey an ultrametric relation [7]: dAC \u2264\nmax(dAB , dBC ). Figure 3(c) shows the percentage of ultrametric triplets for conformation space. The percentage of ultrametric triplets is significantly smaller than\n100%, ruling out a purely ultrametric structure for conformation space. Moreover, the measured percentage of\nultrametric triplets also rules out the random network\nand the tree structure as descriptions of conformation\nspace.\nIn summary, the regular lattice is rejected by the first\ntest, the tree structure is rejected by the first, third, and\nfourth tests, and the random network is rejected by the\nfirst, second and fourth tests. Hence, we conclude that\nthe geometrical properties of the conformation space of a\nlattice polymer chain are consistent with those of smallworld networks but not with the geometric properties of\nthe other geometries discussed in the literature.\nNext, we address the implications of our finding that\nthe conformation space of a lattice polymer chain may be\na small-world network. A central problem in protein folding is the characterization of relaxation processes. The\n\nkinetics of a protein's conformations can be mapped to\na random walk on conformation space. Naturally, the\nmodel studied here is too simplistic to enable us to understand protein folding, however, the study of diffusion\non conformation spaces with small-world geometries may\nstill develop our understanding of relaxation in protein\nfolding. Hence, we consider next the problem of diffusion\non a small-world network. The usual way to solve a diffusion problem is to obtain the density of states \u03c1(\u03bb) of the\ntransition matrix of the system [16]. For a small-world\nnetwork, one has [16,17]\n\u221a\n(2)\n\u03c1(\u03bb) \u223c \u03bbd/2\u22121 exp(\u2212p/ \u03bb) ,\nwhere the \u03bb's are the eigenvalues of the transition matrix\nfor the network. To quantify the relaxation properties,\nwe calculate the probability of return to the origin, usually considered in the study of random walks [18], which\nis the Laplace transform of (2),\nZ \u221e\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb) exp(\u2212\u03bbt) ,\n(3)\nP0 (t) =\n1/l2\n\nwhere the lower limit in the integral is a cut-off that takes\ninto account the finite size of the network. The return\nprobability has the scaling behavior\n\uf8f1\nt \u226a t1\n\uf8f2 t\u2212d/2\nP0 (t) \u2212 P0 (\u221e) \u223c exp(\u2212(p2 t)1/3 ) t1 \u226a t \u226a t2 , (4)\n\uf8f3\nexp(\u2212t/l2 )\nt \u226b t2\n\nwhere P0 (\u221e) = 1/n and the two crossover times scales\ncan be written, in the small-world regime, as\n\u001a\nt1 \u223c 1/p2 \u223c (n\u2217 )2\n,\n(5)\nt2 \u223c pl3 \u223c (n\u2217 )2 (ln n)3\n\nwhere we used the result l \u223c n\u2217 ln n [14]. The results\n(2-5) are consistent with our numerical simulations both\nfor small-world networks and for the conformation space\nof the lattice polymer chain.\nThe description of the conformation space as a smallworld network may be useful for other complex disordered systems such as spin-glasses [19]. Specifically,\nsmall-world networks combine the features of apparent\ninfinite dimensionality and low connectivity thought to\nbe important for glassy relaxation [19,20]. It has been\nhypothesized, that in order to reproduce stretched exponential decays [12,21], the space of accessible conformations must have a tree-like structure [16,20]. We have\nshown that for conformation spaces with a small-world\nstructure stretched exponential relaxation can appear as\nan intrinsic feature of the space's geometry.\n\n2\n\n\fAcad. Sci.

The conformations of a lattice polymer chain and\nthe mapping of the conformation space to a network. (a)\nThe five panels labeled c1 to c5 show 5 different conformations of a 15-mer constrained to have the end monomers fixed\na distance \u2206 apart. We use circles with a light shade to represent the fixed monomers, and dark circles to represent the\nmoving monomers. For numerical convenience, we constrain\nthe chain to occupy the half plane bounded by the thick black\nline. Note that the same results are obtained for other boundary conditions. The conformation of the chain evolves by the\nusual Monte Carlo elementary moves: the corner flip and the\n\"crankshaft\". For example, the chain can switch from conformations c1 to c2 , c2 to c3 , and c3 to c4 by single corner\nflips. In panels c2 to c5 , we use dashed lines and dashed circles to represent the position of the monomer moved from the\nprevious conformation. We use conformations c4 and c5 to\nillustrate the \"crankshaft\" move, which involves the simultaneous movement of two monomers. (b) Mapping of the\nconformation space of a chain to a network. We first allocate a vertex of the network to each allowed conformation of\nthe chain. We then create a link between two vertices if the\ntwo corresponding conformations differ by a single elementary\nMonte Carlo move. For example, since we can switch between\nconformations c1 and c2 by a single move, we put a link between the vertices c1 and c2 . On the other hand, because c5\ncannot be reached from c1 through a single elementary move,\nwe do not place a link between the corresponding vertices.\n\n4\n\n10\n\nC(n,z) / Crandom(n,z)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n6\n5\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n4\n3\n2 1\n10\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\nNetwork size, n\n10\n\n1/d = 0.52\n10\n\nCyclomatic number\n\na\n\nAverage distance, l\n\n3\n\n10\n\nPolymer chain\nSmall\u2212world network\n2D lattice\n10\n\na\n\nPolymer chain\nSmall\u2212world network\n\nz\n\nAverage distance, l\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2.\nAverage shortest distance between chain conformations. We generate all the possible conformations of\nthe polymer chain defined in Fig. 1 for \u2206 = 1, . . . , 6 and\nfor chains with m = 6, . . . , 15 monomers. For each pair of\nvalues (\u2206, m), we identify in the conformation space all the\ndifferent connected networks and calculate their size n. Here,\nwe calculate the average shortest distance between every pair\nof vertices using to the breadth-first search algorithm. (a)\nLoglog plot of the average distance, rescaled according to the\nvalue of average connectivity [8]. For n < 100, the average\ndistance l increases as n1/2 , as it would for a 2-dimensional\nlattice. (b) Same data but in log-linear plot. For n > 1000,\nwe observe l \u223c ln n, as for a random network, and as predicted by Eq. (1). Our results are consistent with the case\nof a small-world network with p \u2248 10\u22123 , clearly ruling out\na low dimensional lattice as a model of conformation space.\nNote that for this and all other figures, the results for the\nsmall-world network have been average over 100 realizations\nof the network while each symbol \"\u25e6\" corresponds to a single\nconformation network. Hence, there is far less noise for the\nsmall-world networks data.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n25\n20\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nNetwork\nPolymer\nchain size, n\nSmall\u2212world network\n2D lattice\nRandom graph\n\n15\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nNetwork size, n\n\nb\n10\n\n3\n\nb\n10\n\n5\n0 1\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n4\n\n10\n\nNetwork size, n\n\n4\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 3.\nStructure of conformation space.\n(a)\nNormalized clustering coefficients for the polymer chain,\nC(n, z)/Crandom (n, z) \u2243 nC(n, z)/z, where z is the average\nconnectivity. For a small-world network, the clustering coefficient will be approximately a constant (for fixed p), and\nthe normalized clustering coefficient increases linearly with\nn. Our results clearly rules out a purely random structure\nfor conformation space since the normalized clustering coefficient for the polymer chain conformation space is orders of\nmagnitude larger than the value for a random network. Note\nthat the apparently logarithmic discrepancy between the two\ncurves in the figure may be due to the logarithmic increase\nof z with n, which is shown in the inset. (b) Cyclomatic\nnumber. The cyclomatic number for a tree structure is identically zero because there are no loops. For a generic network\n[15], the cyclomatic number increases as nz. Hence, we plot\nthe cyclomatic number for the polymer conformation space\nnormalized by the connectivity z. As expected, we observe\na linear increase with size n. (c) Percentage of ultrametric\ntriplets. We calculate the number of triplets obeying the relation dAC \u2264 max(dAB , dBC ). For a purely ultrametric space,\nall triplets have distances obeying this relation. For 2-dimensional square lattices and for small-world networks only\nslightly more than 2/3 of the triplets -which is the lower\nbound- obey the ultrametric relation. In contrast, for random networks and tree structures, we find a higher percentage of triplets to be ultrametric. It is apparent that values\nfor the random network and tree structure are not consistent\nwith the measured values for the polymer conformation space.\nNote that each data point for the polymer chain corresponds\nto a single conformation network while the results for the\nsmall-world network represent an average over 100 networks.\n\n% ultrametric triplets\n\n90\n\n85\n\nTree structure\nPolymer chain\nSmall\u2212world netw.\n2D square lattice\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\nc\n65 1\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\nNetwork size, n\n\n5\n\n\f"}
