This is predicted by the Standard Model (SM) when it is minimally\nextended to include Dirac and/or Majorana masses [1]. In such a case any neutral lepton\nflavor transition is proportional to the neutrino masses m\u03bd \u223c 0.1 eV, and then negligible if\nthe relevant energy scale in the process M is near or above the GeV. Hence, the observation\nof lepton flavor violation (LFV) in processes like \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03bc \u2192 eee or \u03bc N \u2192 e N, or the\nanalogous \u03c4 decays would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the SM.\nOn the other hand, any new physics near the TeV scale involving leptons may induce\nlarge LFV transitions if it is not aligned with the SM charged lepton Yukawa couplings.\nIn this case the relevant scales in the process are the electroweak scale v \u2248 246 GeV and\nthe new scale f of few TeV, with the corresponding ratio v/f \u223c 0.1 almost nine orders of\nmagnitude larger than m\u03bd /M.\u2217 Due to very stringent bounds on LFV processes (as small\nas 10\u221211 for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) new physics at the TeV must incorporate a very efficient lepton flavor\nsuppression mechanism to agree with current and foreseen limits on LFV transitions.\nPresent limits on flavor violating processes set stringent constraints on the possible\nextensions of the SM, in particular on those solving the (little) hierarchy problem like\nsupersymmetry, Little Higgs models and models with large extra dimensions. (See for a\nrecent review [2], and references therein.) These bounds, which in the quark sector and for\n\u03c4 leptons have been improved by BaBar and Belle [3], are also expected to be improved\nfor the first two lepton families in the near future. Thus MEG will improve the precision\non \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee by two orders of magnitude [4, 5], whereas PRISM/PRIME could\nreduce the bounds on \u03bc N \u2192 e N by several orders of magnitude [6]. Super-B factories\nunder study should also improve the precision on \u03c4 decays by an order of magnitude [7].\nLittle Higgs models take care of the large top corrections to the Higgs mass by making\nthe Higgs a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a larger global symmetry broken at a scale of a few\nTeV [8\u201313]. This appealing solution to the little hierarchy problem encounters difficulties\nwhen a specific model is defined. In particular, electroweak precision data [14\u201319] and the\nlimits for flavor violating processes tend to banish the new physics scale to higher energies.\nTo deal with the electroweak data constraints, T-parity [20\u201322] was introduced with the\nLittlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) being the most popular solution for a lighter\nnew scale.\nIn this paper we re-evaluate \u03bc N \u2192 e N in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity [23].\nThis complements our previous calculations of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee in [24] and those\nin [23,25]. The results for the Ti nucleus are in good agreement with previous work [23,26]\nwhere a degenerate mirror quark sector was assumed. Here we have also considered the\neffect of a more general quark sector where we include non-degenerate mirror quark masses\n\u2217\n\nNote that amplitudes must be at least suppressed by one of these ratios, and then cross sections are\nat least quadratically suppressed.\n\n3\n\n\fand arbitrary mixings. We have also found that \u03bc N \u2192 e N is one-loop finite [24, 26, 27].\nThis is apparent for box diagrams but not for Z penguins. In general, this process provides\na stronger bound on the new physics scale f , but limits from all three processes are required\nbecause there are accidental suppressions of any of them in certain regions of parameter\nspace. Obviously, each of them cancel when the heavy lepton Yukawa couplings align with\nthose of the charged leptons, that is the amplitudes vanish when the corresponding mixing\nangle \u03b8 goes to zero. The amplitudes also scale like f \u22122 when the new physics scale goes\nto infinity with all other parameters finite. Present bounds on these processes are satisfied\n< 0.01 or f \u223c\n> 10 TeV. Particular cancellations result from amplitude contributions\nfor \u03b8 \u223c\nof different sign, for example between penguins and boxes, at given parameter values. As\nwe shall discuss, in the case of \u03bc N \u2192 e N these cancellations occur even for degenerate\nquark masses (or just one quark family).\nOn the other hand, box as well as \u03b3 penguin contributions are at most logarithmically\ndivergent when the internal fermion masses go to infinity, whereas the Z penguins add a\nquadratically divergent contribution when these masses are parametrically increased. This\nis similar to what happens in the SM with the top mass mt [28, 29] (and to \u03bc \u2192 eee in\nthese models [24]). In our case the heavy fermion masses are proportional to \u03baf , where\n\u03ba is the corresponding Yukawa coupling. For a fixed f value, the Z penguins scale like\n\u03ba2 , the same as, for instance, the top quark contribution to Zbb\u0304 that scales like \u03bb2 , with\nmt \u223c \u03bbv [30]. In both cases the gauge symmetry, [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]1 \u00d7 [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 in\nthe LHT and SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y in the SM, is spontaneously broken and the heavy fermion\nmass splits the fermion multiplet. Of course, these Yukawa couplings can be large and the\ncorresponding contributions dominant, but they should eventually remain perturbative.\nIn a companion paper we present the evaluation of the three processes \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03bc \u2192 eee\nand \u03bc N \u2192 e N in the Simplest Little Higgs model [31], finding similar results [32]. These\ncalculations can also be applied to the four-dimensional formulation of extended models\nwith large extra dimensions [33, 34]. In this case, however, care must be taken to include\nthe appropriate number of Kaluza-Klein modes to match the five-dimensional result [35].\nIn Section 2 the LHT model is briefly described with the purpose of introducing notation\nand conventions, providing the Feynman rules for quarks, needed to perform the calculation\nof \u03bc N \u2192 e N which were not included in [24]. (They agree with those in [36] up to sign\nconventions.) In Section 3 we detail the different contributions, finding complete agreement\nwith [23] in the total sum. We show in Section 4 that, in general, the conversion rates for\nboth Ti and Au give a more stringent limit than \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee, with Au being\nthe most stringent. Results for Pb are not shown but it was found that it provides a\nlower conversion rate than Ti. We also study the effect of the heavy quark sector on the\nconversion rate. A degenerate heavy quark sector was previously assumed in the literature\narguing that the quark mixing is a higher order effect. We analyze the degenerate case,\nand then show the impact of a non-degenerate heavy quark sector including quark mixings.\nEven assuming degeneracy, the quark mass parameter can entirely cancel the conversion\nrate if chosen appropriately (in a region where box diagrams cancel penguin diagrams).\n4\n\n\fAlthough the effect of the mixings is found to be less important than that of the quark\nmasses, they can have sizable effects on the conversion rate since they can push the values\nof the form factors into regions with cancellations. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to our\nconclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe LHT model\n\nThe Littlest Higgs [13] is a non-linear \u03c3 model based on the spontaneous breaking of a\nglobal SU(5) symmetry into SO(5) by the vacuum expectation value of a five-dimensional\ntensor field. The 14 Goldstone fields are parameterized as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n02\u00d72 0 12\u00d72\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n(2.1)\n\u03a3(x) = \u03be 2 \u03a30 , \u03be = ei\u03a0(x)/f , \u03a30 = \uf8ec\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n12\u00d72 0 02\u00d72\nOnly an [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]1 \u00d7 [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 subgroup of SU(5) is gauged, with generators\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03c3a 0\n0\n\uf8f7\n1\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\nY1 = diag(3, 3, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122),\nQa1 = \uf8ec\n(2.2)\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n2\n10\n0 0 02\u00d72\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n02\u00d72 0\n0\n\uf8f7\n1\n1\uf8ec\na\n\uf8ec\n,\nY2 = diag(2, 2, 2, \u22123, \u22123),\n(2.3)\nQ2 = \uf8ed 0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n2\n10\n0\n0 \u2212\u03c3 a\u2217\n\nand \u03c3 a the three Pauli matrices. This gauge group is broken by \u03a30 down to the SM\ngroup, whose generators are the combinations {Qa1 + Qa2 , Y1 + Y2 }. A discrete T-symmetry\nis introduced [20\u201322] that exchanges the gauge fields G1,2 of [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]1,2 under the\nassumption that g \u2261 g1 = g2 , g \u2032 \u2261 g1\u2032 = g2\u2032 . The T-even combinations remain massless\nwhile those T-odd acquire a mass proportional to f . In order that the SM Higgs doublet\ncontained in \u03a0 is T-even and the remaining Goldstone fields T-odd, the T transformation\non the scalar fields is defined as follows,\nT\n\n\u03a0 \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03a9\u03a0\u03a9,\n\n\u03a9 = diag(\u22121, \u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121)\n\n(2.4)\n\nand then\nT e\n\u03a3 \u2212\u2192 \u03a3\n= \u03a9\u03a30 \u03a3\u2020 \u03a30 \u03a9,\n\nT\n\n\u03be \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u03be \u2020 \u03a9.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe gauge- and T-invariant Lagrangians for the vector and Goldstone bosons can then\nbe written in terms of covariant derivatives. Our sign conventions are those in [24]. After\n5\n\n\fthe electroweak symmetry breaking the photon remains massless, the weak gauge bosons\npick up a mass of order v, the T-odd gauge bosons get rotated to their physical states\nAH , ZH and WH\u00b1 , and the scalar fields are also shifted and rotated accordingly. The latter\ninclude the would-be Goldstone fields \u03b7, \u03c9 0 , \u03c9 \u00b1 eaten by the four heavy gauge bosons\nabove.\nThe introduction of fermions in the model is less straightforward. Since the implementation of the lepton sector was described in detail in [24], which was sufficient for\nthe processes \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee, we present below the relevant Yukawa and gauge\ninteraction Lagrangians for the quark sector, also needed to study \u03bc N \u2192 e N.\n\n2.1\n\nQuark Lagrangians\n\nAs for the lepton sector, one introduces two left-handed fermion doublets in incomplete\nSU(5) multiplets, one transforming only under SU(2)1 and the other under SU(2)2 , for\neach SM left-handed quark doublet [22]:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n0\n\u2212i\u03c3 q1L\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n[5]\n[5\u0304]\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(2.6)\n,\n\u03a8\n=\n\u03a81 = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n2\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u2212i\u03c3 2 q2L\n0\nwhere qiL =\n\nuiL\ndiL\n\n!\n\n.

The fields \u03c7R and \u03c8\u0303R can be assumed to acquire large Dirac masses pairing with\nadditional fermions [22, 37] so that they decouple from the theory.\nThe left-handed quark fields interact with the gauge bosons through the following\ncovariant derivatives:\nLF L = i\u03a8\u03041 D 1 \u03a81 + i\u03a8\u03042 D 2 \u03a82 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere\n\u221a \u2032 \u03a8\na\na\naT\n2ig(W1\u03bc\nQaT\n2ig (y1 1 B1\u03bc + y2\u03a81 B2\u03bc ),\n1 + W2\u03bc Q2 ) +\n\u221a\n\u221a\na\na\n= \u2202\u03bc \u2212 2ig(W1\u03bc\nQa1 + W2\u03bc\nQa2 ) + 2ig \u2032 (y1\u03a82 B1\u03bc + y2\u03a82 B2\u03bc ),\n\nD1\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc +\nD2\u03bc\n\n\u221a\n\n(2.13)\n(2.14)\n\na\nwith Wj\u03bc\n, Bj\u03bc the gauge fields of [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]j and\n\ny1\u03a81 = y2\u03a82 =\n\n1\n,\n30\n\ny2\u03a81 = y1\u03a82 =\n\n2\n.\n15\n\n(2.15)\n\nIt is necessary to enlarge SU(5) with two extra U(1) factors to introduce these hypercharges\n[27], that add up to 1/6 (the hypercharge of the SM left-handed quark doublet).\nThe gauge interactions of the heavy and light right-handed fields are not necessary for\nour calculation since they turn out to be of higher order in v/f , but we include them for\nreference [37]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2020\n1\n\u03bc\n\u2217\n\u2020\nLF R = i\u03a8R \u03b3 \u2202\u03bc + \u03be (D2\u03bc \u03be) + \u03be(\u03a30 D2\u03bc \u03a30 \u03be ) \u03a8R ,\n(2.16)\n2\n2\n(2.17)\nL\u2032F R = iuR \u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + ig \u2032 yu B\u03bc )uR + idR \u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + ig \u2032 yd B\u03bc )dR ,\nwhere yu = 2/3, yd = \u22121/3 are hypercharges that also require the two additional U(1)\nfactors [27].\nIn the case of three generations, the Yukawa Lagrangian (2.10) that provides the masses\nfor the heavy quark states is given by:\n\u0001\nn\nm\n\u2020 n\nLYH = \u2212\u03bamn f \u03a8\u0304m\n(2.18)\n2 \u03be\u03a8R + \u03a8\u03041 \u03a30 \u03be \u03a8R + h.c.,\nwith family indices m, n = 1, 2, 3. This is the primary source of heavy flavor mixing in the\nquark sector, which is completely analogous to the lepton sector. After diagonalization,\n7\n\n\fdiag(\u03bam ) = VLH\u2020 \u03baVRH where VLH (VRH ) acts on the left (right) handed fields, one finds that\nthe masses for the heavy quarks are approximately given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\nv2\n(2.19)\n= 2\u03bam f 1 \u2212 2 .\n= 2\u03bam f, mum\nmdm\nH\nH\n8f\nThen the T-odd gauge boson interactions from (2.12) work out as:\n!\nu\nV\nu\nL L\nq HL VLH\u2020 GH\n+ h.c.,\nVLd dL\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere GH is a T-odd gauge boson (AH , ZH , WH ) and the matrices VLu,d are rotations\nnecessary to make the light sector mass diagonal. The matrices appearing in the coupling\ncan therefore be defined as [39]:\nVHu \u2261 VLH\u2020 VLu ,\n\nVHd \u2261 VLH\u2020 VLd .\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe two light rotations are then related by VLu\u2020 VLd = VCKM and can be obtained from the\nYukawa Lagrangians for the light sector which we now describe.\nFor the SM quark Yukawa couplings, the first two generations are treated separately\nfrom the third one. This is because of the special structure necessary for the collective\nsymmetry breaking mechanism. The third generation requires enlarging \u03a81 and \u03a82 into\nmultiplets of the SU(3)1 and SU(3)2 subgroups of SU(5) [39] adding additional T-even and\nT-odd partners (even and odd combinations of t\u20321 and t\u20322 ), usually denoted by T+ and T\u2212\nrespectively,\nQ31 = id31L , \u2212iu31L , t\u20321L , 0, 0\n\n\u0001T\n\n,\n\nQ32 = 0, 0, t\u20322L , id32L , \u2212iu32L\n\n\u0001T\n\n.\n\n(2.22)\n\nThey have the same transformation properties as \u03a81,2 in (2.7).

For simplicity, we have introduced the quark mixing\n(CKM matrix) in this sector only, choosing the up-type quarks to be directly in the mass\nbasis. This is because of the fact that the three generations of up quarks are implemented\ndifferently, which explicitly breaks flavor symmetries. Although it is possible to restore\nflavor symmetries (see [39] for further details), this is unimportant in our case and it is\nsufficient to assume that all the mixing comes from the rotation in the down sector.

The other matrix, VR would be the rotation\nfor the right handed sector.\nu\nu\nu\n, and\nThe relevant degrees of freedom in VHu (or VHd ) are three angles, \u03b812\n, \u03b823\nand \u03b813\nthree complex phases, as emphasized in [38] where a standard parameterization is proposed.\n\n2.2\n\nFeynman rules for the quark sector\n\nFrom these Lagrangians one can obtain the Feynman rules for the quark vertices entering\nin our calculation. They are in agreement with [36] and are summarized in tables 1 and 2,\nin our sign conventions. Standard Model Feynman rules are used for vertices that involve\nonly ordinary particles and they will not be listed. Although the model predicts some\ncorrections to some of these standard vertices, their contributions are subleading in our\nprocess and we can safely ignore them.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nContributions to the \u03bc N \u2192 e N process\nTopologies and form factors\n\nThe \u03bc N \u2192 e N process receives contributions from both penguin and box diagrams like\nthose shown in figure 1b.

The diagrams look very similar to those involved in\n\u03bc \u2192 eee except for the fact that now up and down-type quarks instead of electrons are\ninvolved on the lower legs.\n9\n\n\fVFF\nAH \u016biH uj\nZH \u016biH uj\nWH+ \u016biH dj\nAH d \u0304iH dj\nZH d \u0304iH dj\nWH\u2212 d \u0304iH uj\n\ngL\n\u0013\nxH v 2\n1\nij\nVHu\n+\n2\n10c\n2s\nf\nW\nW\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nxH v 2\nij\nVHu\n\u2212\n2\n2sW\n10cW f\n1\nij\n\u221a\nVHd\n2sW\n\u0013\n\u0012\nxH v 2\n1\nij\nVHd\n\u2212\n2\n10c\n2s\nf\nW\nW\n\u0013\n\u0012\nxH v 2\n1\nij\nVHd\n+\n\u2212\n2sW\n10cW f 2\n1\nij\n\u221a\nVHu\n2sW\n\u0012\n\ngR\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nTable 1: VFF vertices ie\u03b3 \u03bc (gL PL + gR PR ) for quarks in the LHT model; xH =\n\nSFF\n\u03b7\u016biH uj\n\u03c9 0\u016biH uj\n\u03c9 + \u016biH dj\n\u03b7 d\u0304iH dj\n\u03c9 0 d \u0304iH dj\n\u03c9 \u2212 d \u0304iH uj\n\ncL\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2\ni\n5\nsW\nv\nij\nVHu\n1+ 2\n+ xH\n10cW MAH \u0014\nf \u00128\ncW \u0013\u0015\ni muiH\nv2 1\ncW\nij\n\u2212\nVHu\n1+ 2\n\u2212 xH\n2sW MZH\nf\n8\nsW\nmuiH ij\ni\nVHd\n\u2212\u221a\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 2sW2 M\n\u0012 WH\nv\n5\nsW\ni mdiH\nV ij\n1\u2212 2\n+ xH\n10cW MAH\u0014\nf\u0012 4\ncW \u0013\u0015 Hd\ni mdiH\nv2\n1\ncW\nij\nVHd\n1 + 2 \u2212 + xH\n2sW MZH\nf \u0012 4\n\u0013sW\nmdiH\ni\nv2\nij\n\u2212\u221a\n1 \u2212 2 VHu\n8f\n2sW MWH\nmuiH\n\ncR\ni mui ij\nV\n\u2212\n10cW MAH Hu\ni mui ij\nV\n2sW MZH Hu\ni\nmdi ij\n\u221a\nVHd\n2sW MWH\ni mdi ij\nV\n\u2212\n10cW MAH Hd\ni mdi ij\n\u2212\nV\n2sW MZH Hd\ni\nmui ij\n\u221a\nVHu\n2sW MWH\n\nTable 2: SFF vertices ie(cL PL + cR PR ) for quarks in the LHT model; xH =\n\n10\n\n5gg \u2032\n.\n4(5g 2 \u2212 g \u20322 )\n\n5gg \u2032\n.\n4(5g 2 \u2212 g \u20322 )\n\n\fp1\n\nj\n\n\u03bc\n\ne\n\n\u03bc\n\ne\n\np2\n\ni\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nV\u03bc\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Vertex subdiagrams (a) and topologies (b) involved in \u03bc N \u2192 e N.\nThe contributions of the lepton flavor-changing vertex subdiagrams fit into the following\nLorentz structure [40\u201342]:\u2020\n\u0002\n\u0003\nV\ni\u0393\u03bc (p1 , p2 ) = ie \u03b3 \u03bc (FLV PL + FRV PR ) \u2212 (iFM\n+ FEV \u03b3 5 )\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd Q\u03bd + (iFSV + FPV \u03b3 5 )Q\u03bc , (3.1)\n\nwhere V denotes the external vector boson, either Z or \u03b3 in our case, and Q = p1 \u2212 p2\nas in figure 1a.

As in our previous work [24], we restrict ourselves to the case of two lepton\ngenerations. Then, the lepton sector can be fully determined by four parameters: The LH\nbreaking scale f , the masses of the heavy leptons\u00a7 mHi (i = 1, 2), and the angle \u03b8 that\ndefines the now 2 \u00d7 2 mixing matrix in the lepton sector VHl :\n!\n!\n1\u03bc\n1e\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\nVHl\nVHl\n=\n(4.1)\nVHl =\n2\u03bc\n2e\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\nVHl\nVHl\nWe shall again replace the masses mHi by the parameters \u03b4 and \u1ef9 defined as:\n\u1ef9 =\n\n\u221a\ny1 y2 ,\n\u03b4=\n\nyi =\n\nm2Hi\n,\n2\nMW\nH\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\nm2H2 \u2212 m2H1\n.\nmH1 mH2\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nBoth mHi and MWH are proportional to f and, therefore, \u1ef9 and \u03b4 are independent of this\nscale.\nAll form factors for this process then take the following general form:\nX\n\ni=1,2\n\nie\u2217 i\u03bc\nVHl\nVHl F (yi ) =\n\nsin 2\u03b8\n[F (y1 ) \u2212 F (y2 )],\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\nwith F a generic function.

There is, of course, a dependence in \u1ef9 but the\nbehaviour with changes in this parameter cannot be expressed as simply.\nThe quark sector requires another set of masses and mixings. The two mixing matrices\ninvolved in the quark sector, VHu and VHd , are related by VHd = VHu VCKM so there is,\nin fact, only one matrix that requires fixing. We will assign masses to the three heavy\nquarks ignoring the small mass difference (2.19) between up- and down-type quarks of the\nsame generation (yiu \u2248 yid). The parameters for this sector are defined analogously to the\nthree-family lepton sector in [24]:\nu\n\n\u1ef9 =\nu\n\u03b412\n\n4.1\n\n=\n\np\n\ny1u y2u ,\n\nyiu\n\nm2u2 \u2212 m2u1\nH\n\nmu1H mu2H\n\nH\n\n=\n\nm2ui\n\nH\n\n2\nMW\nH\nu\n\u03b423\n\n,\n\n=\n\n,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3,\nm2u3 \u2212 m2u2\nH\n\nmu2H mu3H\n\nH\n\n.\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nCase without quark mixing\n\nWe will firstly assume no flavor mixing in the quark sector, which can be achieved by\nassuming mass degeneracy of heavy quarks. This is convenient to view the general behavior\nof the model clearly. In figure 3 we show the conversion rates divided by the current\nexperimental limits (R(\u03bc Au \u2192 e Au) < 7 \u00d7 10\u221213 [45] and R(\u03bc Ti \u2192 e Ti) < 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221212\n[46]). Only values below unity are experimentally allowed. The results of [24] for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\n(B < 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 [47]) and \u03bc \u2192 eee (B < 10\u221212 [48]) are also plotted using the same\ninputs. The masses for the heavy quarks have been chosen to correspond to \u1ef9 u = 1 and\nu\nu\n\u03b412\n= \u03b423\n= 0. Natural values for f = 1 TeV, lepton mixing \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, mass splitting \u03b4 = 1\nand \u1ef9 = 4 are taken as a reference, here and in the following unless stated otherwise. Notice\nthat the reference value for \u1ef9 has been shifted from the one used in [24]. The reason for this\ncan be seen in the top right hand graph of figure 3 which shows the dependence on \u1ef9. The\nvalue \u1ef9 = 1 chosen in [24] falls very close to a point where penguin and box diagrams cancel\neach other out. This artificially reduces the value of the conversion rate to values below\nthe values expected for \u03bc \u2192 eee and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 even though in almost any other region the\n\u03bc N \u2192 e N process dominates. These cancellations also occur elsewhere in the parameter\nspace and in the other processes. This only means that the process in question does not\nset a bound on the parameters in that area. The key observation is that the rates for the\nthree processes, \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03bc \u2192 eee and \u03bc N \u2192 e N, in general do not simultaneously vanish\nfor any of the values of the parameters making it impossible for the model to fit into those\nareas. Scanning over parameter space has been discussed in some detail previously [23,26],\nfinding large correlations for non-vanishing cross-sections between different processes. Here\nwe prefer to look for the parameter regions where all processes get small, fulfilling all\nexperimental constraints. This is so when the heavy Yukawa couplings effectively align\nwith those of the charged leptons, i.e. small \u03b8 or \u03b4. Obviously, all new contributions also\ncancel for a large new physics scale, since the corresponding cross-sections scale like f \u22124 .\n16\n\n\f105\n\nRatio to current limit\n\n102\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\n\u03bc \u2192 ee\u0113\n\u03bc Ti \u2192 e Ti\n\u03bc Au \u2192 e Au\n\n101\n\n104\n103\n102\n\n100\n\n101\n100\n\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22121\n.\n\n10\u22122\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n. 10\u22122\n10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121\n\nf [TeV]\n\nRatio to current limit\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n\u1ef9\n\n2\n\n.\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n101\n\n101\n\n100\n\n100\n\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22122\n-0.2 -0.15 -0.1 -0.05 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\nsin 2\u03b8\n\n. 10\u22122\n-0.2 -0.15 -0.1 -0.05 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n\u03b4\n\nFigure 3: Ratios of LHT predictions to current limits, assuming \u1ef9 u = 1 and degenerate\nheavy quark masses, as functions of the different parameters keeping the others at their\nreference values.\n\n17\n\n\f\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\n\n\u03bc \u2192 eee\n\n1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211\n\n10\u221213\n\n10\u221212\n\n10\u221214\n\n3.00\n\n9.93\n\n3.98\n\n12.6\n\nsin 2\u03b8 <\n\n0.111\n\n0.010\n\n0.055\n\n|\u03b4| <\n\n0.106\n\n0.010\n\n0.062\n\nLimit\nf /TeV >\n\n\u03bc Au \u2192 e Au\n\n\u03bc Ti \u2192 e Ti\n\n7 \u00d7 10\u221213\n\n4.3 \u00d7 10\u221212\n\n10\u221218\n\n5.13\n\n234\n\n0.006\n\n0.012\n\n0.038\n\n< 10\u22124\n\n0.006\n\n0.012\n\n0.039\n\n< 10\u22124\n\n9.11\n\nTable 4: Constraints on LHT parameters from present and future experimental exclusion\nlimits, assuming \u1ef9 u = 1 and degenerate heavy quark masses.\nBarring the possibility of these cancellations, it is clear from figure 3 that the most\nrestrictive process is \u03bc Au \u2192 e Au, whose constraints are somewhat more demanding than\nthose previously obtained in [24] for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee and than the ones for \u03bc Ti \u2192\ne Ti. However, this last process is expected to have the greatest improvements in future\nexperiments [4\u20136]. We compare the bounds on the parameters derived from \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and\n\u03bc \u2192 eee with the new ones from \u03bc N \u2192 e N in table 4 for current and future measurements.\nThe bounds on each of the parameters come from keeping all the others at the reference\nvalues and finding the region where the conversion rate (or branching ratio) is within the\nexperimental limit. Notice that these bounds depend strongly on the choice of input values\nso these bounds are not strict.\nA comment about the large \u1ef9 behavior is in order. Figure 4 shows the contributions of\nphoton penguins, Z penguins, boxes and their coherent sum to the total \u03bc \u2212 e conversion\nrate in Au. Notice that only the Z penguins are responsible for the non-decoupling effect,\nsimilar to that of the top quark in the SM [28\u201330]. They saturate the \u03bc \u2212 e conversion\nrate for large \u1ef9, analogously as for \u03bc \u2192 eee in figure 3. For such large values the main\ncontributions results from (3.11), which grows like \u03ba1 \u03ba2 for large heavy Yukawa coupling\n\u221a\n\u03bai , \u1ef9 = y1 y2 \u221d \u03ba1 \u03ba2 .\n\nFigure 5 shows exclusion contours in the (sin 2\u03b8, \u03b4) plane for the present experimental\nconstraints for \u03bc Au \u2192 e Au. The case of \u1ef9 = 1 shows large allowed areas due to the fact\nthat this is close to a cancellation point. In the other cases, the mixing angle and the mass\nsplitting are correlated if we are to remain within the experimental bound, as they were\nfor \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee. The bound is relaxed for higher values of the scale f .\n\nIn figure 6 we show the dependence on the heavy quark mass parameter \u1ef9 u while keeping\nall quark masses degenerate. We observe that the location of the cancellations depends\nstrongly on the value of the lepton mass parameter \u1ef9. Because of these regions, even a\ndegenerate heavy quark sector can be tuned to suppress the lepton flavor changing effect.\nWe therefore conclude that the values of the quark masses can have large effects on the\nconversion rate. The regions themselves, however, are relatively narrow concentrating on\nvery definite \u1ef9 u values.\n\n18\n\n\f.\n\n108\n\nRatio to current limit\n\n106\n104\n\nZ-penguin only\n\u03b3-penguin only\nboxes only\nTotal\n\n102\n100\n10\u22122\n\n.\n\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n\n10\u22122\n\n100\n\u1ef9\n\n10\u22121\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFigure 4: Contributions from photon penguins, Z penguins, boxes and their coherent sum\nto the total \u03bc \u2212 e conversion rate in Au, assuming \u1ef9 u = 1, degenerate heavy quark masses\nand reference values for the remaining parameters.\n\nFigure 5: Contours of R(\u03bc Au \u2192 e Au) = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 for values of f = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 TeV\n(from bottom up) and \u1ef9 = 0.25, 1, 4 (left to right), assuming \u1ef9 u = 1 and degenerate heavy\nquark masses.\n\n19\n\n\f.\n\n105\n\nRatio to current limit\n\n104\n\nAu\n\n.\n\n105\n\n\u1ef9 = 0.25\n1\n4\n\n104\n\n103\n\n103\n\n102\n\n102\n\n101\n\n101\n\n100\n\n100\n\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22121\n\nTi\n\n. 10\u22122\n. 10\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121 100 101 102 103 104 105\n\u1ef9 u\n\n\u1ef9 u\n\nFigure 6: Dependence of the \u03bc N \u2192 e N conversion rate on the heavy quark mass parameter\n\u1ef9 u for degenerate heavy quarks and several values of the lepton mass parameter \u1ef9.\n\n4.2\n\nQuark mixing effects\n\nTo study the effect on the conversion rate of the mixing matrix as it compares to the\neffect of the quark masses, we must choose the quark mass parameters in an area free\nof accidental suppressions. One such choice is the quark mass parameter \u1ef9 u = 1 and the\nlepton mass parameter \u1ef9 = 4. With these values, in figure 7 we make a scatter plot showing\nthe conversion rate as a function of the quark mass splittings. The quark mixing angles\nand phases in VHu (VHd = VHu VCKM ) are uniformly distributed in their full range. The\nsolid lines correspond to minimal heavy quark mixing, that is, alignment of heavy and light\nquark flavors (VHu = I and VHd = VCKM ).\nFrom the right panel of figure 7 we can conclude that the mixing angles, although\nu\nnumerically important, do not alter the result as much as the mass parameters \u1ef9 u , \u03b412\nu\nand \u03b423\n, as long as we are far from a cancellation area. However, taking \u1ef9 = 1 the right\npanel shows that one can obtain virtually any value for the conversion rate by choosing\nthe mixing angles appropriately.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nAs previous studies have demonstrated, LHT models are heavily constrained by flavor.\nIn this paper we complete our study presented in [24] with the third basic LFV process,\n\u03bc N \u2192 e N. We have complemented other calculations [23, 25] of lepton flavor violating\neffects for this process and compared with predictions for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 eee.\n20\n\n\f.\n\nRatio to current limit\n\n105\n\n103\n\nAu\n\n104\n\n.\n\n104\n\nAu\n\n102\nTi\n\n103\n\n101\nTi\n0\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n\n10\u22121\n.\n\n. 10\u22122\n\n101\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\nu\n\u03b412\n\n0\n1\nu\n= \u03b413\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\nu\n\u03b412\n\n0\n1\nu\n= \u03b413\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 7: Ratio of conversion rate to current limit as a function of the heavy quark\nmass splittings for random values of mixing angles.

In earlier works only conversion in Ti was considered but we find\nthat, currently, conversion in Au gives the most stringent limits on the LHT parameters\nin general, producing normalized conversion rates (i.e. the conversion rate divided by the\ncurrent experimental limit) of up to an order of magnitude larger than in the Ti case and\nrequiring a Little Higgs breaking scale of almost 10 TeV or fine tuning at the percent level\nof the mixing angles and mass splittings in the lepton sector, which must be correlated in\norder to fulfill current experimental limits. However, future limits on the Ti conversion\nrate will clearly be the most restrictive.\nNevertheless, certain values of the different parameters can suppress the conversion\nrate by causing accidental cancellations among the different contributions. This means\nthat, in some small regions, these processes do not actually provide any restrictions on the\nmodel, and only those derived from the other processes remain. It is important to note,\nhowever, that the cancellation regions for the various processes do not in general overlap\nand therefore do not allow for the model to survive within them, since there is always at\nleast one process that is above the experimental limits. For \u03bc N \u2192 e N, the origin of these\ncancellations is typically a sign difference between the penguin contributions and boxes,\nwhich allows them to cancel each other.\nWe have also considered the effect of a more general quark sector where we include\nnon-degenerate quark masses and arbitrary mixings, whereas previous studies assumed\n21\n\n\fa degenerate quark sector. We find that even in the degenerate case, there is a sizable\ninfluence of the heavy quark mass parameter and, in some cases, it can completely cancel\nthe conversion rate by pushing the prediction into one of the aforementioned suppression\nregions. We also observe that the remaining quark sector parameters, namely mass splitting\nand mixing angles, can also shift the predictions somewhat although, as may be expected,\nthe effect is smaller (less than a factor 10 in the normalized conversion rate) as long as we\nare far from a suppression region. Otherwise, moving the angles and splittings can again\naccidentally reduce the conversion rate and change the value considerably or even cancel\nit completely.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWork supported by the Spanish MICINN (FPA2006-05294), Junta de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (FQM 101,\nFQM 03048) and European Community's Marie-Curie Research Training Network under\ncontract MRTN-CT-2006-035505 \"Tools and Precision Calculations for Physics Discoveries\nat Colliders\".\n\nA\n\nComparison with previous calculations\n\nWe present below the relation of the form factors for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03bc \u2192 eee and \u03bc N \u2192 e N used\nin this and our previous work [24], which follow from [40, 49], with those introduced by\nBuras et al.
