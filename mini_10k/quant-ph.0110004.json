Their importance lies in the fact that\nthey express in a succinct manner the fundamental limitations on measurements imposed by quantum mechanics. In particular it is these limitations that guarantee\nthat the mathematical formalism of the theory is free\nfrom contradictions with experiment.\nThe time-energy uncertainty however has a particular\nstatus because time is an external parameter in the theory and the energy operator plays a special role since it\ndetermines the temporal evolution. Thus the time energy\nuncertainty does not follow from the commutation relations of two operators, but is determined indirectly, for\ninstance from the mathematical properties of the Fourier\ntransform with respect to the time variable. The interpretation and status of the time-energy uncertainty\nshould therefore be examined with particular care.\nIn this paper we shall concentrate on energy measurements. By analogy with other measurements, one expects that the time-energy uncertainty expresses a fundamental constraint energy measurements must satisfy.\nThe aim of this paper is to clarify whether such a constraint exists, and what should be its interpretation.\n\n\u2217 Also at Departement of Physics, University of South Carolina,\nColumbia, SC 29208.\n\u2020 Also at BRIMS, Hewlett-Packard Labs., Stoke Gifford, Bristol\nBS12-6QZ, U.K.\n\nSuppose that one must measure the energy of an unknown quantum state. One's first intuition[1] in this case\nis that that the energy of an unknown state can be determined to accuracy \u2206E only if the duration \u2206t of the\nmeasurement is larger than 1/\u2206E (since \u2206t\u2206E \u2265 1),\nwhere we set ~ = 1. Here and throughout, by accuracy\nof the measurement, we mean how much the result of\nthe measurement differs from the result of an ideal von\nNeumann measurement of the Hamiltonian operator H.\nThis will be defined with precision below.\nSurprisingly, this intuition is incorrect. It is possible to\nmeasure the energy of an unknown quantum state to arbitrarily high accuracy in an arbitrarily short time[3]. As\nan illustration consider a spin 1/2 particle with a mag~ 0 = B0~1z pointnetic moment \u03bc in a magnetic field B\ning along the z direction. In order to measure the energy of the spin, one can apply a strong magnetic field\n~\nB(z)\n= B(z)~1z pointing in the z direction with a gradient\nin the z direction. This realizes a Stern-Gerlach measurement of \u03c3z , hence of the energy of the particle. The time\nnecessary for this measurement depends on the magnitude of the additional magnetic field B(z), not on the\noriginal magnetic field B0 . Since B(z) can be arbitrarily large, the energy can be determined in an arbitrarily\nshort time. Another example, which is discussed in detail\nin the original article, is the measurement of the energy\nH = p2 /2m of a free particle.\nThus the time-energy uncertainty seems not to apply\nto energy measurements. Is this result universal? Or are\nthere cases where the time-energy uncertainty does apply\nand measuring energy to an accuracy \u2206E does require a\ntime \u2206t limited by \u2206t\u2206E \u2265 1?\n\n\f2\nWe first note that if one attempts to devise an energy\nmeasurement, it is often the case that this measurement\nwill take a time that satisfies the time-energy uncertainty.\nWe refer for instance to the example considered by Landau and Peirels[1], see also Landau and Lifshitz[2], in\nwhich the kinetic energy of a particle is measured by letting it collide with another particle initially at rest. In\nthis example if the energy is to be measured with precision, the initial momentum of the particle at rest must\nbe well known, but then its position is spread out and\nthe time at which the measurement takes place is uncertain. Another well known example is the radiative decay\nof an excited state. The emission of a photon by an excited atom that decays to its ground state can be viewed\nas a measurement of the energy of the electronic state\nof the atom. The mean time it takes for the photon to\nbe emitted, that is the lifetime of the excited state, is\nthen interpreted as the mean time it takes to make the\nmeasurement. This lifetime is related to the line width,\nthat is to the uncertainty of the energy measurement,\nby the time-energy uncertainty. Following [3] one would\nargue that such energy measurements, which satisfy the\ntime-energy uncertainty, are simply badly designed, and\nthat one can in principle make energy measurements that\ndo not obey the time-energy uncertainty. Nevertheless it\nis surprising that so many energy measurements do obey\nthe time-energy uncertainty. We would like to know what\nmakes some energy measurements less efficient than others.\nThere are also some particular circumstances in which\nthe time-energy uncertainty must be obeyed in an energy\nmeasurement. Specifically consider the situation in which\none wants to measure the energy of an isolated system.\nSince it is isolated, ie. uncoupled to any exterior degrees\nof freedom, the measuring apparatus must be internal to\nthe system itself. In [4] it is argued that this constraint\nimplies that measuring the total energy of an isolated\nsystem to accuracy \u2206E requires a time \u2206t that satisfies\n\u2206t\u2206E \u2265 1. Contrary to the examples mentioned in the\npreceeding paragraph, where a more sophisticated strategy could in principle measure the energy in a smaller\ntime than that given by the uncertainty relation, in this\ncase the uncertainty relation must be obeyed.\nThus the present status of the time-energy uncertainty\nin the context of energy measurements is unsatisfactory.\nDifferent examples suggest conflicting interpretations.\nAs we shall prove bellow, the resolution of this puzzle\nis the following. When the Hamiltonian of the system is\nknown the conclusions of [3] hold, namely we can measure\nthe energy as precisely as we want in a time as short as we\nwant. On the other hand, whenever the Hamiltonian of\na system is completely unknown, determining what is the\nHamiltonian to precision \u2206H requires a time \u2206t given\nby \u2206t\u2206H \u2265 1.\nThe origin of the conflicting interpretations of the timeenergy uncertainty relation in the context of estimating\nthe energy of an unknown state is now clear. In some\ncases the energy measurement can also serve to estimate\n\nan unknown Hamiltonian. In these cases, because the\nmeasurement can serve this dual purpose, it requires a\ntime \u2206t which is limited by the accuracy with which it\ncould estimate an unknown Hamiltonian. On the other\nhand the measurements envisaged in [3] cannot estimate\nan unknown Hamiltonian. These measurements measure\nan operator A (\u03c3z in the example above, or the momentum p in the example of [3]). If the Hamiltonian\nis a function of this operator H = f (A) (for instance\nH = \u03bcB0 \u03c3z or H = p2 /2m), then the measurement of\nA can be used to determine the energy of an unknown\nstate. Such a von Neumann measurement of an operator\nA can be realized in an arbitrarily short time. But if\nthe time is very short, the measurement is brutal, that is\nthe interaction between the measuring apparatus and the\nsystem dominates the evolution. It is therefore impossible to use such a measurement to estimate an unknown\nHamiltonian since the action of the original Hamiltonian\nis completely masked by the interaction.\nTherefore in order to understand the interpretation of\nthe time-energy uncertainty relation in the context of energy measurements, it is mandatory to first understand\nthe limitations quantum mechanics imposes on the estimation of the Hamiltonian acting on a system when\nthe Hamiltonian is unknown. This problem is in a certain sense the dual of the standard problem of quantum\ninformation in which one must estimate the state of a\nquantum system. Here one must estimate the dynamics.\nThis is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics.\nIn fact many experimental situations can be phrased in\nthis language. For instance there could be an unknown\nforce acting on a particle which one wants to estimate. Or\nthe Hamiltonian could depend on an unknown parameter\nwhich one wants to estimate.\nWe show in the present paper that the precision with\nwhich one can estimate the dynamics and the time required for this estimation are related by an uncertainty\nrelation\n\u2206t\u2206H \u2265 1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the precise meaning of \u2206H depends on the details\nof the problem.\nIt is intuitively obvious that the dynamics of a quantum system cannot be estimated instantaneously. Indeed\nsuppose that initially the state is \u03c80 . Then after a time t\nthe state has evolved to \u03c8(t, H) = e\u2212itH \u03c80 \u2243 \u03c80 +itH\u03c80 .\nFrom this expression it is clear that in order to estimate\nthe dynamics, ie. to estimate H, sufficient time must\nelapse that the zero'th order term \u03c80 in the expansion\nin t does not dominate. Where this the case, the states\n\u03c8(t, H) would be almost identical to \u03c80 and hence undistinguishable. The results reported in this paper make\nthis qualitative statement precise.\nThe problem of estimating the dynamics has been considered recently by Childs, Preskill and Renes[5]. Their\nresults constitute a starting point for our discussion.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows.\nWe first discuss the problem of distinguishing with cer-\n\n\f3\ntainty between two Hamiltonians. Next we consider the\ncase where one only wants to estimate with finite error\nprobability which of the two Hamiltonians is the true\nHamiltonian. Then we turn to the problem of estimating\nwhat is the Hamiltonian when one has no prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian. Finally we go back to the\nproblem of estimating the energy of an unknown state.\nWe discuss how it is related to estimating an unknown\nHamiltonian. We prove that if the Hamiltonian is completely unknown then the time necessary to estimate the\nenergy and the precision with which the energy is estimated must obey a time-energy uncertainty relation. We\nillustrate the problem of estimating the energy of a state\nwhen the Hamiltonian is completely or partially unknown\nby several examples.\nII.\n\nDISTINGUISHING BETWEEN TWO\nHAMILTONIANS\n\nA.\n\nMinimum time necessary to distinguish\nbetween two unknown Hamiltonians\n\nIn this section we consider the problem of estimating\nthe Hamiltonian acting on a system when the Hamiltonian is unknown. We consider in this section the special\ncase in which there are only two possible Hamiltonians\nthat could act on the system, H1 or H2 , and one must\ndistinguish with certainty which it is.\nThis particular problem has been considered previously by Childs, Preskill and Renes[5]. They show that\nthe minimum time \u2206t to determine with certainty the\nHamiltonian must satisfy the constraint\n\u2206t D0 (H1 , H2 ) \u2265 \u03c0 .\n\n(2)\n\nwhere D0 (H1 , H2 ) measures how much the two Hamiltonians differ and is defined as follows. Take the difference\nd\nof the two Hamiltonians H d = H1 \u2212H2 . Denote by Emax\nd\nd\nand Emin the largest and smallest eigenvalue of H respectively. Then D0 (H1 , H2 ) is given by\nd\nd\nd\nd\nD0 (H1 , H2 ) = max{Emax\n\u2212 Emin\n, |Emax\n|, |Emin\n|} .\n(3)\n\n(This expression generalises a result of [5]).\nIn the appendix it is shown that D0 is a distance on\nthe space of Hamiltonian operators (ie. it is symmetric, positive and equal to zero only if the two Hamiltonians coincide, and it obeys the triangle inequality). This\nimportant property is central to some of the arguments\nbelow.\nIn order to make the problem considered by Childs,\nPreskill and Renes more concrete, consider the following\nexample. You are given a box in which there is one of\n~ 1 or B\n~ 2 . Your task is to\ntwo unknown magnetic fields B\ndetermine which kind of box you have. The only way you\ncan probe the box is to send through the box a specific\nkind of particle of magnetic moment \u03bc. Thus the two\n\nboxes differ in that they act as two different Hamiltoni~ 1,2 * ~\u03c3 . Given sufficient time or a sufficient\nans H1,2 = \u03bcB\nsupply of particles you can always determine what is the\nmagnetic field. (We suppose that the time that the particles pass in the box can be freely chosen, for instance\nby choosing their initial velocity. And one can send the\nparticle through the box as many times as one wants).\nHowever if you are given only one particle, what is the\nminimum time necessary to accomplish this task? Childs,\nPreskill and Renes show that this time is limited by eq.\n(2).\nWe now present a proof of eqs. (2, 3) that is inspired by\nthe techniques developed to study interaction free measurements in [6]. The proof is also closely connected\nto the bounds on oracle query complexity obtained in\n[7] and even more so to a continuous-time analogue obtained in [8]. We first describe the most general strategy\nthat could be used. First of all, we consider that we\nmay let the particle go into the box or not, i.e. for certain values of its position the particle can pass through\nthe box and for others not. This allows us to make a\nsuperposition of particle passing through the box and\nnot passing through the box. Mathematically we describe this by the decomposition of the Hilbert space\ninto the sum H = Hbox \u2295 HN box where Hbox corresponds\nto the particle passing through the box and HN box corresponds to the particle passing next to the box. Second, we consider that the particle can also be entangled\nwith some other particle, called ancilla, onto which the\nhamiltonian doesn't act (eg. the ancilla is kept out of\nthe box). The Hilbert space is thus further increased to\nH = (Hbox \u2295 HN box ) \u2297 Hancilla .\nIn the particular problem considered in this section,\nnamely, distinguishing between two possible Hamiltonians, using an ancilla turns out to be irrelevant. (However when one must distinguish between more than two\nHamiltonians, using an ancilla can be helpfull, see [5] for\na simple example). To simplify the proof we will first consider the case with no ancilla and then show in section\nII C that the presence of the ancilla makes no difference.\nThe most general strategy consists of sending the particle several times through the box and making an arbitrary unitary transformation on the particle after each\npassage. We describe this as follows. Initially the particle is in state |\u03c80 i. Before the k-th passage through\ni\ni where the superthe box the particle is in state |\u03c8k\u22121\nscript i = 1, 2 corresponds to which Hamiltonian H1,2\nis acting on the particle. We decompose the state as\ni\n|\u03c8k\u22121\ni = |uik i+|vki i where |uik i \u2208 Hbox and |vki i \u2208 HN box .\nAfter\npassing through the box the particles state is\n\u2032\n|\u03c8ki i = e\u2212iHi tk |uik i+|vki i where tk is the time the particle\nis in the box (and we have supposed without loss of generality that if the particle does not pass through the box the\nHamiltonian is zero). We then make an arbitrary unitary\n\u2032\n\u2032\ntransformation on the particle |\u03c8ki i \u2192 |\u03c8ki i = Uk |\u03c8ki i.\nWe can describe the whole evolution succinctly by\ni\n|\u03c8ki i = Uk e\u2212iH\u0303i tk |\u03c8k\u22121\ni\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\nabsolute value of the right hand side of (11) is bounded\nby |Im[h\u03c8 k |H\u0303 d |\u03c8 \u22a5 i]| \u2264 D0 (H1 , H2 )/2 where D0 is given\nby (3). We therefore have\n\nwhere H\u0303i is the extension of Hi to Hbox \u2295 HN box . It is\nequal to Hi on Hbox and equal to zero on HN box .\nWe therefore have\n1\n2\ni,\nh\u03c8k1 |\u03c8k2 i = h\u03c8k\u22121\n|eiH\u03031 tk e\u2212iH\u03032 tk |\u03c8k\u22121\n\n(5)\n\n|\n\nor expressed differently\nh\u03c8k1 |\u03c8k2 i\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\nh\u03c8k\u22121\n|\u03c8k\u22121\ni\n\nd\u03b8\n| \u2264 D0 (H1 , H2 )/2 .\ndt\n\n(14)\n\nIntegrating we have\n=\n\n1\nh\u03c8k\u22121\n|eiH\u03031 tk e\u2212iH\u03032 tk\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n1|\u03c8k\u22121\ni\n\n(6)\n\nThe procedure to distinguish between H1 and H2 can\nonly improve if the total time T is kept fixed, but the\nparticle is allowed to pass more times through the box.\nThat is the discrimination can only improve if one takes\nsmaller time intervals tk . In the limit of infinitesimal tk\none obtains\ndh\u03c8 1 |\u03c8 2 i\n= ih\u03c8 1 |(H\u03031 \u2212 H\u03032 )|\u03c8 2 i = ih\u03c8 1 |H\u0303 d |\u03c8 2 i\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere H\u0303 d = H\u03031 \u2212 H\u03032 is equal to H d = H1 \u2212 H2 on Hbox\nand equal to zero on HN box . The absolute value of the\noverlap therefore changes as\nd|h\u03c8 1 |\u03c8 2 i|2\n= 4Im[h\u03c8 2 |\u03c8 1 ih\u03c8 1 |H\u0303 d |\u03c8 2 i] .\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nWe can always write the states |\u03c8 1,2 i as\n\u0001\n|\u03c8 1 i = e+i\u03c7/2 cos(\u03b8/2)|\u03c8 k i + sin(\u03b8/2)|\u03c8 \u22a5 i ,\n\u0001\n|\u03c8 2 i = e\u2212i\u03c7/2 cos(\u03b8/2)|\u03c8 k i \u2212 sin(\u03b8/2)|\u03c8 \u22a5 i ,\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 ,\n\nh\u03c8 k |\u03c8 \u22a5 i = 0\n\n.

In the case of H\u0303 d ,\nd\nits largest eigenvalue is max{Emax\n, 0} and its smallest\nd\nd\nd\neigenvalue is min{Emin , 0} (where Emax\nand Emin\nare\nd\nthe largest and smallest eigenvalues of H ). Hence the\n\n.\n\n\u2212\n\nD0 (H1 , H2 )t\nD0 (H1 , H2 )t\n\u2264 \u03b8(t) \u2212 \u03b8(0) \u2264\n.\n2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nInitially \u03b8(0) = 0 since |\u03c8(0)i is independent of i. Requiring that one can recognize with certainty which is the\nHamiltonian, that is requiring \u03b8(t) = \u03c0/2, one finds that\ntD0 (H1 , H2 ) \u2265 \u03c0, as announced.\nIn the above proof the possibility of letting the particle\ngo through the box as well as outside the box allows us\nto extend the Hamiltonian H d so that it also has the\neigenvalue zero. This is described by replacing Hi with\nH\u0303i . It is the possibility that allows the maximum in\nd\neq. (3) to be taken not only over the first term Emax\n\u2212\nd\nd\nEmin , but also over the two other terms, |Emax | and\nd\n|Emin\n| and makes our result eq. (3) differ from the result\nobtained in [5]. Indeed if one does not allow for this\nthen eq. (2) continues to hold, but eq. (3) is replaced\nd\nd\nby D0 (H1 , H2 ) = Emax\n\u2212 Emin\n. Thus in this case the\nmeasurement may be less efficient.\nIn order to illustrate how the \"in/out of the box\" possibility can be used, we consider the following example.\nWe are given one of two black boxes, and must distinguish which box we have. The boxes are conducting and\nhollow. They are connected to an external electrostatic\npotential. The only way the two boxes differ is that the\npotential can take two different values \u03c61 and \u03c62 . The\nonly way we can probe which box we have is by sending a charged particle through the box. The particle will\ntherefore acquire a phase which depends on the potential.\nMathematically we can describe this as the problem of\ndistinguishing two Hamiltonians H1,2 = H0 +\u03c61,2 I where\nI is the identity operator. In order to distinguish which\nbox we have, we put the particle in a superposition of\ntwo states, one of which passes through the box and the\nother which does not. Thus we prepare the particle\nin\n\u221a\nthe state (| through boxi + |Not through boxi)/ 2 and\nsend the particle at a speed such that it passes a time\nT = \u03c0/(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) in the box. After this time the particle\nis in one of two orthogonal states\n(| Not through boxi \u00b1\n\u221a\nei\u03c0\u03c61 /(\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62) |through boxi)/ 2 which can easily be distinguished. On the other hand, if we had not been allowed to use the \"out of the box\" alternative, we could\nnot have distinguished between the 2 Hamiltonians since\nthey differ only by a constant term which adds an unobservable phase to the wave function.\nThere are also situations where it is not necessary to\nuse the \"in/out of the box\" possibility. Suppose one must\ndistinguish, using a spin 1/2 particle of magnetic moment\n\u03bc, between two magnetic fields of equal magnitude but\npointing in opposite directions B1,2 = \u00b1B0~1z . The strategy in this case is simply to prepare the spin in state | \u2191x i\n\n\f5\nand let it evolve in the magnetic field a time T = \u03c0/\u03bcB0\nand then to measure the operator \u03c3y .\nB.\n\nD0 (H1total (t), H2total (t))\n= D0 (H1 (t) \u2297 Hancilla (t), H2 (t) \u2297 Hancilla (t))\n= D0 (H1 (t), H2 (t)) .\n(19)\n\nDistinguishing between two time dependent\nHamiltonians\n\nIn the preceeding section we considered the case where\nthe two Hamiltonians which must be distinguished are\ntime independent. One can easily generalize this result\nto the case where the Hamiltonians are time dependent.\nLet us suppose one must distinguish between two time\ndependent Hamiltonians H1 (t) and H2 (t). The arguments of section II A can be followed unchanged until\neq. (14) which becomes\n|\n\nd\u03b8\n| \u2264 D0 (H1 (t), H2 (t))/2\ndt\n\n(16)\n\nwhere D0 (H1 (t), H2 (t)) is the instantaneous value of the\ndistance eq. (3). Integrating we have\nZ t\nD0 (H1 (t), H2 (t))\ndt\n\u2212\n\u2264 \u03b8(t) \u2212 \u03b8(0)\n2\n0\nZ t\nD0 (H1 (t), H2 (t))\ndt\n\u2264\n.\n2\n0\n(17)\nInitially \u03b8(0) = 0 since |\u03c8(0)i is independent of i. Requiring that one can recognize with certainty which is the\nHamiltonian, that is requiring \u03b8(t) = \u03c0/2, one finds that\nZ t\ndt D0 (H1 (t), H2 (t)) \u2265 \u03c0\n(18)\n0\n\nwhich is the generalization of the constraint eq. (2) to\nthe case of time dependent Hamiltonians.\nC.\n\nNow the distance D0 between two such Hamiltonians\nobeys\n\nUsing an ancilla does not help to distinguish\nbetween two Hamiltonians\n\nIn the proof of eqs. (2, 3) and (18) given in sections\nII A and II B we did not consider the possibility that the\nparticle passing through the box is entangled with another particle (ancilla) was not considered. We shall now\nshow that if we assume the ancilla is not allowed into the\nbox, then eqs. (2, 3) and (18) continue to hold.\nTo this end it is helpfull to view the particle and ancilla as a single larger system with Hamiltonian Hitotal =\nHi (t) \u2297 Hancilla (t) where Hi is unknown and Hancilla\nis known but arbitrary, and to reformulate the task as\nthe problem of distinguishing H1total from H2total . Note\nthat this reformulation englobes apparently more involved strategies where for instance the ancilla is repeatedly measured and the evolution made conditional on the\nresults of these intermediate measurements. Indeed by\nincluding the measuring device in an even bigger ancilla\none recovers the above formulation.\n\nThus the time required to distinguish between the two\nHamiltonians eq. (18) does not depend on the presence\nof the ancilla.\nThe basic reason why an ancilla does not help in distinguishing between two unknown Hamiltonians is that\nall the argument of section II A depends on the eigenvalues of the difference between the two Hamiltonians H d\nbut not on the degeneracy of the eigenvalues. Including\nand ancilla does not change the eigenvalues of H d , but\nchanges their degeneracy.\n\nD.\n\nAttaining the bound in the dichotomic case\n\nWe shall now show that one can always attain the\nbound eq. (2). In general this will require putting the\nparticle in a superposition of \"in the box\" and \"out of\nthe box\" states. Equation (13) shows that to attain the\nbound the particle must be kept in a superposition with\nequal weights of the eigenstates of H\u0303 d = H\u03031d \u2212 H\u03032d with\nd\nd\nmaximal and minimal eigenvalue, |\u1ebcmax\ni and |\u1ebcmin\ni. In\nthe preceeding section we gave two examples of how to\ndo this when the two Hamiltonians H1 and H2 commute.\nWhen the Hamiltonians do not commute one must use\na more complicated strategy. Let us first rewrite the\nHamiltonians H\u03031 and H\u03032 as\nH\u03031 = H\u0303 + + H\u0303 d /2\n\n,\n\nH\u0303 + = (H\u03031 + H\u03032 )/2\n\n,\n\nH\u03032 = H\u0303 + \u2212 H\u0303 d /2 ,\n\nH\u0303 d = H\u03031 \u2212 H\u03032 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe evolution during a small time interval \u03c4 can then be\nwritten as\nexp(\u2212iH\u03031 \u03c4 ) = exp(\u2212i(H\u0303 + + H\u0303 d /2)\u03c4 )\n\u2243 exp(\u2212iH\u0303 + \u03c4 ) exp(\u2212iH\u0303 d \u03c4 /2) exp(O(\u03c4 2 )) ,\n\nexp(\u2212iH\u03032 \u03c4 ) = exp(\u2212i(H\u0303 + \u2212 H\u0303 d /2)\u03c4 )\n\n\u2243 exp(\u2212iH\u0303 + \u03c4 ) exp(+iH\u0303 d \u03c4 /2) exp(O(\u03c4 2 )) .\n(21)\n\nTo distinguish the two Hamiltonians we initially prepare\n\u221a\nd\nd\ni + |\u1ebcmin\ni)/ 2.\nthe system in the state |\u03c8(0)i = (|\u1ebcmax\nThe evolution is the following. We let the unknown\nHamiltonian act for a small time \u03c4 = T /N where T =\n\u03c0/D0 (H1 , H2 ) and N is a large integer. We then act\non the system with the unitary transformation U =\nexp(\u2212i\u03bd H\u0303 d ) exp(+iH\u0303 + \u03c4 ) where \u03bd is an arbitrary real\nnumber. The term on the right in U cancels the term\non the left in eq. (21). This unitary evolution U can in\nprinciple be done in an arbitrarily short time. After N\n\n\f6\nrepetitions, the evolution is\nh\niN\nexp(\u2212i(\u03bd \u00b1 1/2)H\u0303 d \u03c4 ) exp(O(\u03c4 2 )) |\u03c8(0)i\n\n|\u03c8(T )i =\n\n\u2243 exp(\u2212i\u03c0(\u03bd \u00b1 1/2)H\u0303 d)|\u03c8(0)i\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have written an expression valid in the limit of\nlarge N Thus we obtain two orthogonal states which can\nbe distinguished with certainty.\nNote that if we take the arbitrary real number \u03bd to\nbe either \u00b11/2, then U = exp(\u2212i\u03c4 H\u03031,2 ), that is we have\nexactly canceled the evolution of one of the Hamiltonians.\nThis is the technique that is proposed in [5].\n\nIII.\n\nESTIMATING AN UNKNOWN\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nA.\n\nFormulation of the problem\n\nIn the previous section we considered the situation\nwhere one must distinguish with certainty between two\npossible Hamiltonians. In the present section we shall\nconsider the problem where one must estimate with finite precision what is the Hamiltonian.\nIn order to give a precise formulation to this problem,\nlet us suppose that the possible Hamiltonians are denoted Hi and can occur with a priori probabilities p(Hi ).\nAfter an evolution that lasts for a time \u2206t, a measurement is carried out which yields result j. The probability\nof result j given that the Hamiltonian is Hi is denoted\np(j|Hi ). The result of the measurement allows one to estimate what is the Hamiltonian. We shall suppose that\none makes a guess of what is the true Hamiltonian. Call\nthe guess Hjguess . Note that Hjguess can be one of the\ninitial Hamiltonians Hi , or it could be a different Hamiltonian altogether. The quality of the guess is measured\nby an uncertainty\nX\nX\np(j|Hi )D(Hi , Hjguess ) .\n(23)\np(Hi )\n\u2206H =\ni\n\nj\n\nIn this equation D(Hi , Hjguess ) is a distance on the\nspace of Hamiltonians that measures how close the guess\nis to the true Hamiltonian Hi . It is natural to normalize the distance D, for instance by requiring that\nD(H, H + E 11) = E.\nThere are many different distances on the space\nof\nFor instance D(H1 , H2 ) =\np Hamiltonians.\nT r(H1 \u2212 H2 )2 /d where d is the dimension of the\nHilbert space. In general the distance that one will use\nwill depend on the specific problem one considers. In\nthe present paper we shall use the distance D0 introduced in eq. (3). The reason is that this is the distance\nthat appears in the results of section II, and these results are used in the arguments below. We expect that\nusing another distance would change quantitatively, but\nnot qualitatively, our results.\n\nOne of the most fundamental questions concerning the\nestimation of an unknown Hamiltonian is the relation\nbetween the precision \u2206H with which the Hamiltonian is\nknown and the time \u2206t used to carry out the estimation.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to addressing\nthis question.\nB.\n\nEstimating a Hamiltonian which can only take\ntwo values, H1 or H2\n\nAs a first application of the general problem of estimating an unknown Hamiltonian consider the particular\nsituation in which their are only two possible Hamiltonians, H1 and H2 , which are equally probably (p(H1 ) =\np(H2 ) = 1/2) and the task is to estimate which it is in\na finite time \u2206t. The quality of this estimate shall be\nexpressed by using as distance on the space of Hamiltonians the distance D0 defined in eq. (3). The techniques\ndeveloped in section II will allow us to solve this problem\nexactly.\nIn section II it was shown that if \u2206t \u2265 \u03c0/D0 (H1 , H2 ),\nthen the two Hamiltonians can be distinguished perfectly and therefore \u2206H is zero. On the other hand\nwhen \u2206t \u2192 0, it is impossible to obtain any information about the Hamiltonians and the best strategy is to\nrandomly guess either H1 or H2 . Hence in this limit\n\u2206H \u2192 D0 (H1 , H2 )/2. For intermediate times \u2206H will\ndecrease from D0 (H1 , H2 )/2 to zero as a function of \u2206t.\nWe shall show that for the optimal estimation strategy,\n\u2206H is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\nD0 (H1 , H2 )\u2206t\nD0 (H1 , H2 )\n1 \u2212 sin(\n)\n.\n\u2206H = max 0,\n2\n2\n(24)\nTo prove this let us first show that for an optimal guessing strategy it is sufficient that the guessed Hamiltonian\nbe either H1 or H2 . We recall that in the estimation\nproblem as formulated in section III A we left open the\npossibility of guessing a Hamiltonian that is not one of\nthe possible Hamiltonians Hi . In the present case it is\nnot necessary to consider such possibilities.\nTo show this let us consider the contribution of guess\nj to \u2206H (we denote this contribution \u2206H(j)):\n1\np(j|H1 )D(H1 , Hjguess )\n2\n1\n+ p(j|H2 )D(H2 , Hjguess ) .\n2\nUsing the triangle inequality we can write\n\u2206H(j) =\n\n\u2206H(j) \u2265\n\n(25)\n\n1\np(j|H1 )D(H1 , H2 )\n2\n1\n+ [p(j|H2 ) \u2212 p(j|H1 )]D(H2 , Hjguess ) (26)\n.\n2\n\nIf p(j|H2 ) \u2212 p(j|H1 ) \u2265 0 we finally have\n\u2206H(j) \u2265\n\n1\np(j|H1 )D(H1 , H2 )\n2\n\n(27)\n\n\f7\nwith equality if and only if Hjguess = H2 . Thus if the\na posteriori probability that the Hamiltonian was H2 is\ngreater than the a posteriori probability that the Hamiltonian was H1 one should guess that the Hamiltonian is\nH2 . And conversely if the a posteriori probability that\nthe Hamiltonian was H1 is greater than the a posteriori probability that the Hamiltonian was H2 one should\nguess that the Hamiltonian is H1 .\nLet us now consider the optimal evolution and measurement strategy. The estimation strategy starts with\na given quantum state \u03c80 . If the Hamiltonian is H1 this\nstate evolves into \u03c81 (t) whereas if the Hamiltonian is H2\nthe state evolves into \u03c82 (t). In section II A it was shown\nthat the overlap between these two states must obey the\ninequality\n|h\u03c81 (t)|\u03c82 (t)i| \u2265 cos\n\nD0 t\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwith equality attained for the optimal strategy (we have\ndenoted D0 = D0 (H1 , H2 )). Furthermore it is shown\nin [10] that the probability pE of making an error when\ntrying to distinguish two equiprobable states \u03c81 and \u03c82\nis bounded by\np\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 |h\u03c81 |\u03c82 i|2\n1 \u2212 sin(D0 t/2)\n\u2265\n(29)\npE \u2265\n2\n2\nwith equality attained if one carries out a von Neumann\nmeasurement of the basis (|\u03c8 k i \u00b1 |\u03c8 \u22a5 i)/2. Hence we find\nthat for the optimal strategy\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD0\nD0 \u2206t\n\u2206H = pE D0 =\n1 \u2212 sin(\n)\n(30)\n2\n2\nwhich proves eq. (24).\nC.\n\nEstimating a completely unknown Hamiltonian\n\nWe now consider the situation where the Hamiltonian\nis completely unknown. Once more we shall use as distance on the space of Hamiltonians the distance D0 of\neq. (3). We shall show that in this case the precision\n\u2206H with which the Hamiltonian is estimated and the\ntime used to estimate the Hamiltonian must obey the\nconstraint\n\u2206H\u2206t \u2265\n\n1\n.\n4\n\n(31)\n\nThis constitutes one of the fundamental results of this\npaper.\nTo prove this, we will contrast two situations. In the\nfirst situation (which is the one we are interested in) the\nexperimenter has no information about the Hamiltonian.\nIn the second situation we imagine that there is a \"spy\"\nthat knows the true Hamiltonian, call it H0 . The spy\nthen tells the experimenter that the true Hamiltonian is\neither H0 or some other Hamiltonian H1 . The a priori\n\nprobabilities that the spy chooses Hamiltonian H0 or H1\nare equal.\nDenote by \u2206H the maximum precision with which\nthe Hamiltonian can be known in the first case and by\n\u2206Hdicho the maximum precision with which the Hamiltonian can be known with the help of the spy. Obviously\n\u2206t\u2206H \u2265 \u2206t\u2206Hdicho since the time intervals are the\nsame in the two situations and the information provided\nby the spy can only increase the precision with which\none can estimate the Hamiltonian. This means that\n\u2206t\u2206H \u2265 max \u2206t\u2206Hdicho where the maximum is taken\nover all possible choices of the spy. The results of section\nIII B can be used to show that max \u2206t\u2206Hdicho \u2265 1/4,\nwhich proves eq. (31).\nTo show that max \u2206t\u2206Hdicho \u2265 1/4, note that in the\ndichotomic case, the product \u2206H\u2206t takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD0 \u2206t\nD0 \u2206t\n\u2206H\u2206t =\n1 \u2212 sin(\n)\n(32)\n2\n2\nfor 0 \u2264 \u2206t \u2264 \u03c0/D0 . For small times this tends to zero\nsince \u2206H is bounded and \u2206t \u2192 0. And for \u2206t \u2265 \u03c0/D0\nthe product is zero since \u2206H = 0. There is an intermediate time where the product attains its maximum. One\neasily shows (using sin x \u2264 x for x \u2265 0, which implies\nthat x(1 \u2212 sin x) \u2265 x(1 \u2212 x)) that the maximum value of\nthis product is greater than a quarter:\nmax \u2206H\u2206t \u2265\nD.\n\n1\n.\n4\n\n(33)\n\nEstimating a completely unknown Hamiltonian\nacting in a d dimensional space\n\nEquation (31) gives a lower bound on the product of\nthe precision with which a completely unkown Hamiltonian is measured and the time taken to estimate it. We\nbeleive that this lower bound is not tight and that in\ngeneral a stronger lower bound should hold. We do not\nknow at present what form this stronger lower bound will\ntake, but we beleive that it should depend on the dimensionality of the Hilbert space on which the Hamiltonian\nacts.\nAn indication that this should be the case is provided\nby an example due to Farhi and Gutmann [8] inspired by\nGrover's search algorithm[9]. In this example one must\ndistinguish between d Hamiltonians of the form Hk =\nE|kihk| where the d states |ki form an orthonormal basis.\nFarhi and Gutmann show that in order to distinguish\nthese Hamiltonians perfectly, a minimum time of \u2206t \u2265\ncd1/2 /E is necessary (where c is some positive constant).\nThis example shows that there are situations where\nestimating an unkown Hamiltonian becomes increasingly\ndifficult as the dimension d of the Hilbert space on which\nit acts increases. However in the Fahri\u2013Gutmann example, the unkown Hamiltonian has a very specific form\nwhich is known before hand. We have obtained preliminary indications that when the Hamiltonian is completely unkown, estimating it should take substantially\n\n\f8\nmore time than sugested by the Fahri-Gutmann example.\nWe hope to report on this issue in a future publication.\n\nIV.\n\nMEASURING ENERGY WHEN THE\nHAMILTONIAN IS UNKNOWN\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe results presented in the preceding section concerning the estimation of Hamiltonians have important implications for energy measurements. As shown in [3] the\nenergy of the state can be measured in an arbitrarily\nshort time. However a careful scrutiny of the arguments\nof [3] shows that a quick energy measurement is possible only if the Hamiltonian is known. In the example\ndiscussed in the introduction, it is possible to carry out\na quick energy measurement only because we know that\n~ 0 of known magnitude\nthe particle is in a magnetic field B\npointing along the +z direction. Suppose however that\nthe magnetic field is pointing initially either along the +z\nor the \u2212z axis. Then a measurement of \u03c3z yields no information about the energy. Thus in order to determine\nthe energy of the particle, we must also determine the\nmagnetic field. That is we must also determine what is\nthe Hamiltonian. But as we discussed above, determining the Hamiltonian will take a minimum time \u2206t. (We\nsuppose that the only way we can probe the magnetic\nfield is with a particle of magnetic moment \u03bc. Of course\nif we could use a particle of larger magnetic moment, the\nmeasurement of the magnetic field could be done faster).\nThus in this example measuring the energy of the state\ncannot be done instantaneously because the Hamiltonian\nis not perfectly known.\nIn fact this is a very general result. We shall show below that if the Hamiltonian acting on a system is completely unknown, then the precision \u2206E with which one\ncan estimate the energy of the state in a time interval \u2206t\nobeys the constraint\n\u2206t \u2206E \u2265 1/4 .\n\n(34)\n\nThis assertion follows easily from the results obtained\nin the previous section. However before proving it we first\nneed to define with precision what we mean by accuracy\n\u2206E of an energy measurement.\n\nB.\n\nAccuracy of an energy measurement\n\nAn ideal energy measurement is a von Neumann\nmeaP\nsurement of the Hamiltonian operator H = E E|EihE|.\nIf the quantum state is |\u03c8i, the measurement gives result\nE with probability p(E|\u03c8) = |h\u03c8|Ei|2 .\nLet us consider an imperfect measurement. This measurement will predict that the energy is E \u2032 with probability p(E \u2032 ). Neither the energies E \u2032 nor the probabilities\np(E \u2032 ) need coincide with the energies and probabilities\n\nfor an ideal energy measurement. Nevertheless we would\nlike to define in a precise way the accuracy of an energy\nmeasurement.\nThe simplest situation in which to define the accuracy\nof an energy measurement is when the quantum state is\nan energy eigenstate |\u03c8i = |Ei. In this case the true\nenergy of the state is well defined. Hence the accuracy of\nthe imperfect energy measurement is simply the amount\nby which the energies E \u2032 differ from the true energy E:\nX\n\u2206E =\np(E \u2032 |E)|E \u2032 \u2212 E|\n(35)\nE\u2032\n\nwhere p(E \u2032 |E) is the probability that the estimated energy is E \u2032 when the quantum state is \u03c8 = |Ei.\nIf the state is not an energy eigenstate then we define the accuracy of the energy measurement as the average over the probability |hE|\u03c8i|2 that an ideal energy\nmeasurement gives result E times of the accuracy of the\nmeasurement if the state is |Ei:\nX\nX\n\u2206E =\n|hE|\u03c8i|2\np(E \u2032 |E)|E \u2032 \u2212 E| .\n(36)\nE\n\nE\u2032\n\nC. Proof of the time-energy uncertainty relation\nfor energy measurements when the Hamiltonian is\ncompletely unknown\n\nWe start by noting that the proof of eq. (34) when \u03c8\nis not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian follows from the\ncase where \u03c8 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian since\nwe have defined in (36) the uncertainty when \u03c8 is not\nan eigenstate of the Hamiltonian as the average of the\nuncertainties when \u03c8 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian\ntimes the probability that a measurement of the Hamiltonian operator yields the corresponding energy. Therefore\nwe can restrict ourselves to considering the case where\n\u03c8 = |Ei is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H. Since\nthe Hamiltonian H is completely unknown, the state \u03c8\nis also unknown.\nTo prove eq. (34) we fix \u2206t and contrast as in the\nsection III C, two situations. In the first one has no information about the Hamiltonian. In the second a spy\ngives the additional information that the Hamiltonian is\neither H0 (the true Hamiltonian) or H1 . We shall suppose that H1 = H0 + \u01eb11 where \u01eb is a c-number and 11\nis the identity operator. We shall further suppose that\nwith the information provided by the spy there is equal\na priori probabilities that the Hamiltonian is H0 or H1 .\nLet us denote the energy uncertainty in the first situation\nby \u2206E and in the second situation by \u2206Espy . Obviously\nwe have \u2206t\u2206E \u2265 \u2206t\u2206Espy since \u2206t is the same in both\nsituations and the information provided by the spy can\nonly decrease the energy uncertainty. We therefore want\nto put a bound on \u2206Espy .\nFirst note that since the two Hamiltonians H0 and\nH1 = H0 + \u01eb11 commute the experimenter can immediately determine what is the state \u03c8 by measuring the\n\n\f9\noperator H0 . This measurement can in principle be done\narbitrarily fast. Hence the experimenter knows that the\nenergy is either E, the true energy, or E + \u01eb.\nSince the experimenter has only two possibilities between which to choose, an optimal strategy will consist\nof guessing either that the energy is E or E + \u01eb. It is not\nnecessary to consider other possibilities such as guessing\nthat the energy is E+\u01eb/2. Furthermore the energy uncertainty will be \u2206Espy = \u01ebpE where pE is the probability\nof making the wrong guess. The proof of these assertions\nfollows from the fact that \u2206E, as defined in eq. (35), is\nlinear in the probabilities p(E \u2032 ) times a distance |E \u2032 \u2212 E|\non the space of energies. Hence the arguments of section\nIII B, eqs 25 to 27, can be used in the present case.\nBut the error probability pE of mistaking one energy for the other is identical to the error probability of\nwrongly identifying the Hamiltonians H0 and H1 (since\nknowing the energy is equivalent to knowing the Hamiltonian). Hence in the present case \u2206Espy = \u2206H where\n\u2206H is the uncertainty in estimating the two Hamiltonians H0 and H1 . But we have shown in section III B\nthat for given \u2206t there exists a choice of \u01eb such that\n\u2206t\u2206H \u2265 1/4.\nD. Saturating the time-energy uncertainty for\nenergy measurements when the Hamiltonian is\nunknown?\n\nWe now address the question of whether it is possible\nto devise a universal measurement strategy that can determine the energy of an unknown state even if there is\nno prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian? Such universal measurement strategies exist and are well known. We\nillustrate them by a typical example, namely the emission of electromagnetic radiation by an excited state of\nan atom.\nWe then inquire whether this measurement strategy\nsaturates the time-energy uncertainty relation obtained\nin the previous section. It turns out that for this measurement strategy, and using the definition of section IV B,\n\u2206t\u2206E is infinite. However in a qualitative way this measurement strategy does obey a time energy uncertainty.\nThis is discussed in detail.\nAs mentioned in the introduction the emission of one\nor more photons by an excited atomic state can be viewed\nas a measurement of the energy of the electrons. The coupling between the measuring apparatus (the electromagnetic field A\u03bc ) and the system (the electron) is realized\nthrough the interaction\nZ\nHint = d3 xA\u03bc (x)J\u03bc (x)\n(37)\nwhere J\u03bc (x) is the electric current. In interaction representation it takes the form\nZ \u221e\nX \u2020\nd\u03c9\n(a\u03c9k ei\u03c9t + a\u03c9k e\u2212i\u03c9t )Jk\u03c9 .\n(38)\nHint =\n0\n\nk\n\nHere \u03c9 is the energy of the photons, k represents other\ndegrees of freedom of the photons in addition to their\nenergy (momentum and polarization) and Jk\u03c9 are operators acting on the electrons Hilbert space. The photons\nare taken to be initially in their ground state a\u03c9k |0i = 0.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian eq. (37) is independent of\nthe electron Hamiltonian, ie. it is independent of whether\nthe electron is bound to a proton, a Helium nucleus, a\nmolecule, etc . . . . Therefore such a measurement can determine the energy of an unknown state, independently\nof the Hamiltonian. It can also determine what is the\nHamiltonian, since the energy of the emitted photons\nwill differ if the electron is bound to a proton, a Helium\nnucleus, a molecule, etc . . . . The price to pay for this\nuniversality is that the energy resolution of the measurement and the time necessary for the measurement are\nconstrained by the time-energy uncertainty. The arguments presented in this paper show that this will always\nbe the case for a measurement of energy which does not\ntake into account prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian.\nAn important limitation of the above measurement\nscheme is that the emitted photon only reveals the difference in energy between the initial and final state of the\natom. If there are several allowed transitions with identical energy differences, then the measurement will not\nallow these initial states to be differentiated. It would\nhave to be complemented by a second measurement to\ndetermine which of the possible final states the atom\nreached. Nevertheless the important point of this example is to show that in principle it is possible to come close\nto saturating the time energy uncertainty relation when\nestimating the energy of a system whose Hamiltonian is\nunknown.\nIn order to see how close we come to saturating the\ntime-energy uncertainty in this scheme, let us examine it\nin more detail. The probability density that a photon is\nemitted at time t is:\nP (decay at time t) = \u03b3e\u2212\u03b3t .\n\n(39)\n\nThus the time it takes to complete the measurement is\nnot well defined. Rather this time is variable but its mean\nis finite\nZ\ndt t P (decay at time t) = \u03b3 \u22121 .\n(40)\nThis is to be contrasted with the situation envisaged in\nthe previous sections where we required that the measurement be finished after some time interval \u2206t.\nLet us now consider the energy of the emitted photon.\nIf the true energy of the electronic state is E0 , then the\nprobability density that the emitted photon has energy\nE is\nP (emitted photon has energy E) =\n\n\u03b3\n1\n.\n\u03c0 \u03b3 2 + (E \u2212 E0 )2\n(41)\n\n\f10\nIf we compute the accuracy of the energy measurement\nusing the definition eq. (36), we find\nZ\n\u2206E =\ndEP (emitted photon has energy E)|E \u2212 E0 |\n= +\u221e .\n\n(42)\n\nThus this measurement satisfies the time energy uncertainty relation. In fact the product \u2206t\u2206E is infinite\nsince both the time it takes to complete the measurement and the energy uncertainty are infinite. However\nwe note that if we modify the definition of \u2206t to be the\nmean time \u03b3 \u22121 taken to carry out the measurement, and\nif we modify the definition of the energy uncertainty \u2206E\nto be the linewidth \u03b3, then this measurement does obey\na time energy uncertainty relation.\nTherefore it may be possible to devise a better energy\nmeasurement that saturates the time-energy uncertainty\nderived in section IV C. Or this uncertainty relation is\ntoo strong, and one can prove a weaker form of the uncertainty relation, for instance using as definition of \u2206t\nand \u2206E the mean time taken to do the measurement\nand the line width. In the latter case the measurement\njust described would be optimal in the sense that it would\nsaturate the time energy uncertainty for energy measurements when the Hamiltonian is unknown.\n\nE.\n\nEstimating energy when one has partial\nknowledge about the Hamiltonian\n\nIn the previous section we considered the situation\nwhere one wants to estimate the energy of an unknown\nstate but one has no prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian. When some prior knowledge is available the situation is considerably more complicated and the relation\nbetween the time used for the measurement and the precision with which the energy can be estimated will depend on the details of the problem.\nTo illustrate this we consider two examples. First consider the case of two Hamiltonians H1 and H2 that have\nthe same eigenstates H1 \u03c8k = E1k \u03c8k , H2 \u03c8k = E2k \u03c8k\nand their eigenvalues coincide except for one eigenstate:\nE1k = E2k (k 6= k0 ) but E1k0 6= E2k0 . Suppose we must\ndetermine the energy of an unknown state \u03a8. A strategy to do this in a short time is to first carry out a\nvon Neumann measurement of the basis \u03c8k that diagonalizes H1 and H2 (this can be done in an arbitrarily\nshort time). If one finds that the outcome k is different\nfrom k0 , then one immediately knows the energy. On\nthe other hand if k = k0 , then to know the energy one\nmust determine what is the Hamiltonian. This takes a\ntime \u2206t = \u03c0/|E1k0 \u2212 E2k0 |. If the unknown state \u03a8 was\nuniformly distributed in Hilbert space (denoted H), then\nthe probability that \u03a8 belongs to subspace k0 is 1/dimH\nand the average time necessary to determine the energy\nof the state is \u03c0/dimH|E1k0 \u2212E2k0 | which is much smaller\nthan the time needed to determine the Hamiltonian. The\n\nreason for this difference in time scales is because the particle has most of its support in a part of the Hilbert space\nwhere the two Hamiltonians do not differ.\nOur second example is superficially similar to the previous one. But more careful consideration show some\nsubtle differences. We consider a particle confined to a\n(one dimensional) box. The potential in the box vanishes everywhere, except in a corner where it may be\neither zero or take a large negative value. In order to\nmeasure the energy of the particle in a minimum time\nthe following strategy seems natural. First we measure\nwhether the particle is in the corner or not. (This position measurement should be slightly fuzzy so as not to\ndisturb the momentum too much). This measurement\ncan in principle be done in arbitrarily short time. If the\nparticle is not in the corner, we measure its momentum,\nand hence know its energy. This can also be done in arbitrarily short time. If the particle is in the corner, then\nwe must determine the value of the potential in order\nto know the energy of the particle. This takes a finite\ntime of order 1/\u2206V , where \u2206V is the uncertainty in the\npotential.\nThus in this case it seems that the minimum time required for the energy measurement depends essentially\non the probability of the particle being in the corner\nof the box rather than on the precision \u2206E with which\none wants to know the energy. However the situation is\nmore complicated. The above procedure approximates to\nsome extent a von Neumann measurement of the Hamiltonian operator. Indeed the statistics of the measurement outcomes are such that they reproduce correctly\nthe moments of the Hamiltonian operator. Thus for instance upon repeating the measurement many times one\nwill obtain a good estimate of the average energy hHi,\nor the average value of any power of the Hamiltonian\nhH n i. However the above procedure is not equivalent to\na von Neumann measurement of the Hamiltonian operator (which is the task we set out to perform). Indeed\nthere are some functions of the Hamiltonian which cannot be estimated correctly with the above procedure.\nSuppose for instance that the particle is known to be\napproximately localized at a distance d from the corner\nof the box (d is taken to be much larger than the size of\nthe region where the potential is unknown) and suppose\nthat it is known that the momentum of the particle is approximately p. Since the particle is far from the corner,\nby measuring the momentum of the particle one has some\ninformation about its energy. For instance independent\nrepetitions of the measurement will yield estimates of the\nmoments of the Hamiltonian operator hH n i. Such measurements of the momentum can be done in an arbitrarily short time. However suppose that one wants to measure the operator cos(mdH/p) = (eimdH/p + e\u2212imdH/p )/2\n(where m is the mass of the particle). This is the real\npart of the operator that evolves the particle from its\ninitial position up to the corner where the potential is\nunknown. The expectation value of the above operator\nclearly depends on the value of the potential in the cor-\n\n\f11\nner, and therefore it can only be determined in a time of\norder 1/V .\nThe origin of this surprising situation is that in the\nabove example the exact spectrum of H depends on the\npotential in the corner. When the particle is far from\nthe corner, most questions concerning the energy of the\nparticle are independent of the exact spectrum of H. But\na variable such as cos(mdH/p) is sensitive to the exact\nspectrum and therefore in order to measure it one must\nknow what is the potential in the corner. Operators such\nas cos(mdH/p) are called modular variables, and have\nbeen introduced in [12].\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present article we have shown that if the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution of a quantum system is\nunknown, then the time necessary to estimate the Hamiltonian obeys a time-energy uncertainty relation eq. (2).\nTo this end we first gave a simple proof of the problem\nconsidered by Childs, Preskill and Renes[5] where there\nare only two possible Hamiltonians between which one\nmust choose. We then showed how to extend this result\nto the case where there are many Hamiltonians among\nwhich one must choose. The bound we obtained is probably not tight when the unknown Hamiltonians act in\na space of large dimensionality d > 2, and it should be\npossible to refine it by a more detailed analysis.\nOur results concerning the time-energy uncertainty relation applied to estimating Hamiltonians have many applications. In particular they provide new insight about\nhow the time-energy uncertainty applies to energy measurements. It has been shown by Aharonov and Bohm\nthat if the Hamiltonian of the system is known, then the\nHamiltonian can in principle be measured in arbitrarily short time. On the other hand we show that if the\nHamiltonian is unknown then the energy measurement\ncannot be done in arbitrarily short time. The minimum\namount of time required depends on the details of the\nproblem, for instance what is the prior knowledge about\nthe Hamiltonian, what is the prior knowledge about the\nstate, and exactly what one wants to know about the\nenergy of the state. We show that if one has no prior information about the Hamiltonian, then the time taken to\ncarry out the measurement and the precision with which\nthe energy is measured obey a time-energy uncertainty\nrelation.\nWe also show that one can devise a measurement of the\nenergy of a quantum system that always works, independently of any prior knowledge about the system. Such a\nmeasurement is obtained by coupling the system to an\nexternal apparatus that oscillates at all frequencies and\nsuch that each frequency is coupled to different degrees\nof freedom of the apparatus. This is illustrated in eq.\n(38) in the case where the external apparatus is taken to\nbe the electromagnetic field. Such measurements do not\nsaturate our time energy uncertainty relation, although\n\nthey do obey a qualitatively similar uncertainty relation\nbetween the life time of the state and the line width.\nTo conclude, we find that the real meaning of energy\nin quantum mechanics is that of governing the time evolution of a system. To measure the energy one has to\ndetermine the time evolution, and this takes time. Thus\nenergy measurements require time, and their precision\nis limited by the time we have at our disposal. On the\nother hand, in the examples presented by Aharonov and\nBohm [3], the Hamiltonian is known in advance, hence\none need not spend time to determine the time-evolution.\nInstead, one could find out the value of the energy not by\ndetermining the time evolution, i.e., not by measuring the\nactual energy, but by measuring an operator (the operator to which the Hamiltonian is equal) whose numerical\neigenvalue is equal to that of the energy. However, we\nemphasize that although this procedure does yield the\nnumerical values equal to that of the energy, it is not a\nproper energy measurement. Indeed, if we believe the\nHamiltonian to be H but in reality it is different, say H \u2032 ,\nthen the value obtained by the instantaneous AharonovBohm measuring procedure (which tells us to measure\nthe operator H) would no longer be correct, and, furthermore, we would not know that our measurement is\nwrong. Thus a proper energy measurement necessarily\nprobes the time evolution and therefore cannot be done\ninstantaneously. Rather the time taken to carry out the\nmeasurement and the precision with which one knows\nthe energy are constrained by a time energy uncertainty\nrelation \u2206t\u2206E \u2265 1.\nAcknowledgments\n\nY.A. acknowledges the support of Grant 471/98 of\nthe Israel Science Foundation established by the Israel\nAcademy of Sciences and Humanities.

(3) is a distance on the space of Hamiltonians. That is D0 is 1) positive: D0 (H1 , H2 ) \u2265 0 with\nequality if and only if H1 = H2 ; 2) D0 is symmetric:\nD0 (H1 , H2 ) = D0 (H2 , H1 ); and 3) D0 obeys the triangle\ninequality: D0 (H1 , H2 ) \u2264 D0 (H1 , H3 ) + D0 (H3 , H2 ).\nLet us first introduce a norm\n||H||0 = max{E max \u2212 E min , |E max |, |E min |}\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere E max , E min are the largest, smallest eigenvalues\nof H.
