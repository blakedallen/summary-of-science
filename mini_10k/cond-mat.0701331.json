Physik I, Wilhelm-Klemm-Str. 9, D-48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe functional integral formalism of quantum physics deals with infinite dimensional integrals, which can only be computed explicitly in a few simple\nsituations. A non-perturbative method to tackle models, which are not analytically soluble, starts by a regularisation to a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom. This is usually achieved by a lattice discretisation of the time (in\nquantum mechanics) or of the space-time (in quantum field theory). In a\nfinite volume the functional integral is then given by a finite set of single\nvariable integrals. One tries to compute them numerically and - based on\na variety of such results - to extrapolate to the continuum and to infinite\nvolume. The transition to Euclidean time is very helpful to speed up the\nconvergence of the integrals.\nHowever, the number of integrals still tends to be so large that straight\nnumerical integration is hopeless. Instead one performs Monte Carlo simulations to generate a set of paths or field configurations with the Boltzmann\nprobability distribution given by the Euclidean action. Thus one evaluates\nthe expectation values of the observables of interest directly at finite interaction strength (in contrast to perturbation theory). On the other hand,\none has to face errors due to the limited statistics and uncertainties in the\nextrapolations.\nHence it is essential to optimise the algorithmic tools for such simulations.\nThe Metropolis algorithm is the most established procedure, but in many\ncases it is far from optimal. It can be refined to cluster algorithms [1, 2]\nwhich are by far more efficient for some set of models (for a review, see\nRef. [3]). Unfortunately this set, where it could be applied successfully, is\nstill quite small - in particular it excludes gauge theories up to now.2 But in\nthe light of the striking success in specific spin models, it is highly motivated\nto explore cluster algorithms further. Here we present successful tests on\n(classical) spin chains, which describe quantum mechanical systems.3\nUnlike the Metropolis algorithm, cluster algorithms do not proceed from\none configuration to the next by updating single spins, but by flipping whole\n2\n\nThere have been proposals for cluster algorithms for U (1) gauge theory [4], but a\nbreakthrough in the performance is still outstanding. For the treatment of a discrete\ngauge group, see e.g. Ref. [5].\n3\nThe motivation we are giving here are functional integrals in quantum physics, but\ncluster algorithms have a much broader range of applicability, which also reaches out to\nfields like solid state physics and biology; for recent examples, see Refs. [5\u20138].\n\n2\n\n\fclusters of them. First, this is promising in view of the thermalisation time\nneeded in the beginning of a simulation. Later one expects to generate with\nthe cluster algorithm well de-correlated configurations (which are needed for\nthe measurements) with a modest number of simulation steps. In addition,\nmulti-cluster algorithms can often be combined with an \"improved estimator\", which allows for the inclusion of lots of configurations that do not need\nto be Monte Carlo generated explicitly. All these properties help to reduce\nthe computer time required to measure an observable numerically to a given\naccuracy. This will be clearly confirmed for the system under consideration\nin this work, in particular as one approaches the continuum limit.\nWe apply this technique to the O(2) spin chain (the XY model), to be\ndescribed in Section 2. There is a neat way to attach a half-integer topological charge to each cluster. This is the basis of a meron cluster simulation,\nwhich was first applied to a 2d O(3) model on a triangular lattice (with a\nconstrained maximal angle between neighbouring spins) [9], see also Ref. [10].\nIn this framework an improved estimator is extremely powerful. Variants of\nthe meron cluster algorithm can also handle fermionic spin models successfully [11].\nIn Sections 3 and 4 we present a novel application of this algorithm [12]. It\nenables us to approach the continuum limit much better than the Metropolis\nalgorithm, and to suppress the notorious \"critical slowing down\". As in\nthe original application, it is powerful enough to even explore the system\nwith a \u03b8-term. In almost all cases the simulation of a system with a complex\nEuclidean action is hardly feasible so far (perhaps up to a region of very small\nimaginary parts).4 Here we present one of the rare exceptions. Moreover,\nthe constraint on the angles is not necessary in our case; the latter was\nrequired for technical reasons in the original application [9] (though it did\nnot affect the universality class). Section 5 is dedicated to our conclusions\nand an outlook on potential applications of the techniques discussed here to\na system of light quarks at high temperature.\n\n2\n\nThe quantum rotor\n\nWe deal with a free scalar particle of mass m on a circle of radius 1, i.e. a\nquantum rotor. Its position is given by an angle \u03c6(t), where t is the Euclidean\ntime, so the Lagrangian reads L = m2 \u03c6\u0307(t)2 . We consider the propagator G\n4\n\nFor reviews of the situation in QCD at finite baryon density, we refer to Refs. [13].\n\n3\n\n\fbetween the end-points \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6(T ) = 0 (T > 0), i.e. we assume\nperiodic boundary conditions. In the path integral formulation it can be\ndecomposed into disjoint contributions with different winding numbers \u03bd. It\nis therefore the simplest quantum system with topological sectors. As in\nQCD we can also insert a \u03b8-term in this summation, which leads to\nG(0, T ; 0, 0) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nG\u03bd (0, T ; 0, 0) ei\u03bd\u03b8\n\n\u03bd=\u2212\u221e\n\nr\n\n\u221e\nh 2m\u03c0 2\ni\nm X\n=\nexp \u2212\n\u03bd 2 + i\u03bd\u03b8\n2\u03c0T \u03bd=\u2212\u221e\nT\n\u221e\nh\n1 X\nT \u0010\n\u03b8 \u00112 i\n=\nexp \u2212\n\u03bd\u2212\n.\n2\u03c0 \u03bd=\u2212\u221e\n2m\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.1)\n\nG\u03bd is the free propagator h2\u03c0\u03bd, T |0, 0i on a line, and we set ~ = 1. It is\nsufficient to consider \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0].\nIn QCD it appears natural that a \u03b8-term should occur, hence it is a mystery - known as the \"strong CP problem\" - why the observed \u03b8-angle is\nzero (or very close to it). In our case, a finite \u03b8-angle does describe a physical\nsituation, if we assume the particle to carry an electric charge q and a magnetic flux \u03a6 to cross the circle. Then we identify \u03b8 = 2\u03c0q\u03a6 (Aharonov-Bohm\neffect). Unlike QCD, we can evaluate in the present toy model the effect of\n\u03b8 > 0 precisely, see Section 4.\nWe now discretise the period T in L equal steps. We use lattice units, i.e.\nwe set the step length T /L = 1. We denote \u03c6(t = j) = \u03c6j , and periodicity\nimplies \u03c6j+L \u2261 \u03c6j . The standard action on this temporal lattice reads\nSs [\u03c6] = m\n\nL\nX\n\n[1 \u2212 cos(\u03c6j+1 \u2212 \u03c6j )] .\n\n(2.2)\n\nj=1\n\nIn contrast, the perfect lattice action [14], which is obtained from an infinite iteration of renormalisation group transformations,5 distinguishes the\ntopological sector that the particle may enter at time slice j\nL\n\nmX\n[\u03c6j+1 \u2212 \u03c6j + 2\u03c0\u03bdj ]2 .\nSp [\u03c6, \u03bd] =\n2 j=1\n5\n\nFor scalar particles in field theory this method is discussed in Refs. [15].\n\n4\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fIn the functional integral all these sectors \u03bdj \u2208 ZZ are summed over, which\nreproduces the exact continuum result.\nThis discrete system has another interpretation as a spin chain. On each\n~j = (S (1) , S (2) ) of length S\n~ 2 = 1 is attached. This is\nsite j a classical spin S\nj\nj\nj\nthe XY model, which has a global O(2) symmetry.

If we identify the constants as \u03b2c = m, we\nobtain the standard lattice path integral of the quantum rotor at \u03b8 = 0 (up\nto an additive constant in the action); the angle \u03c6j describes the direction\n~j , and also the spin model can be generalised by a \u03b8-term.\nof the spin S\nThe standard discretised system does not have natural topological sectors, because all configurations can be continuously deformed into one another (in contrast to the case of continuous time). Still one often introduces\ntopologies, which is, however, ambiguous. The most obvious option is the\ngeometric charge [16], which can be formulated analogously for instance in\nN-dimensional O(N + 1) models, or in 4d Yang-Mills gauge theories [17].

To this end, a random direction ~r is chosen\n6\n\nWe refer here to the correlation length \u03be at \u03b8 = 0.\n\n6\n\n\f~j is split into S\n~ k = (S\n~j * ~r) ~r and\nin an isotropic way (|~r| = 1), and each spin S\nj\n~\u22a5 = S\n~j \u2212 S\n~ k . A virtual bond is set between the sites j and j + 1 with the\nS\nj\nj\nprobability\n(\n~kS\n~k\n\u22122\u03b2 S\n~k * S\n~k > 0\nj j+1\n1\n\u2212\ne\nif S\nj\nj+1\npj =\n(3.1)\n0\notherwise .\nThen a cluster is composed of neighbouring spins connected by bonds;\nit may also consist of a single spin, if the latter is disconnected. A step\nof the algorithm ends with \"flipping\" each cluster with the probability 1/2\n[1]. Flipping a cluster means that all its spins are mirrored at the plane\n~ k \u2192 \u2212S\n~ k, S\n~\u22a5 \u2192 S\n~ \u22a5 . This algorithm respects\nperpendicular to ~r, S\nj\nj\nj\nj\nergodicity and detailed balance [2].\nLet us numerate the clusters with c = 1, 2, . . . . A topological charge Qc\ncan be assigned to each cluster based on the difference of the total topological\ncharge \u03bd (i.e. the winding number) of the chain when the cluster is in its\ninitial orientation, and after it has been flipped [9],\nQc =\n\n\u03bdc\u2212initial \u2212 \u03bdc\u2212flipped\n.\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nOn the right-hand-side we use the geometric charge (2.5). Qc is a half-integer,\nwhich remains unchanged if any other clusters are flipped, so it is determined\n~j . . . S\n~k be the spins\nlocally [12]. To illustrate this important property, let S\nof a specific cluster. We denote the sum of the relative angles \u2206\u03c6j \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]\n~d\n~\n(cf. eq. (2.5)) between the successive neighbouring spins l to n as S\nl Sn , and a\n~ \u2032 .

In fact, this holds\ngenerally, which is easy to show by distinguishing different cases of the angles\n~\\\n~\n~\\\n~\u2032\nS\nj Sj\u22121 and Sj Sj\u22121 .\nIt is a peculiarity of the spin chain that there cannot be any loop inside\na cluster, as we see from prescription (3.1). Thus the cluster charges are\n7\n\n\flimited to the values 1/2, 0 and \u22121/2, and the corresponding clusters are\ndenoted as meron, neutral cluster and anti-meron, respectively.\nThe property that Qc is determined locally for each cluster7 enables us to\nconstruct an improved estimator, which will be applied as a powerful tool in\nthis work. With Nc clusters, 2Nc configurations can be obtained by cluster\nflips, which could enter the statistics (without the need for a Metropolis\naccept-reject step). In practice it is not optimal - or not even possible - to\ninclude all of them (we encountered Nc values up to 40), unless this average\ncan be evaluated analytically. Of course these configurations are not fully\nindependent because they are all affiliated to the same direction ~r.\n\n3.2\n\nCluster statistics\n\nIt is common lore that the \"characteristic\" cluster size follows the correlation\nlength. Taking a close look at this property, we found that the statistical\ndistributionP\nof cluster with length s can be fitted well to a sum of three exponentials, 3i=1 ci exp(\u2212s/si ). For large clusters the first term is dominant.\nIts decay is given by s1 = 1.000(1)\u03be, in precise agreement with the expectation. This supports the interpretation of the clusters as physical degrees of\nfreedom, which is the basis of the meron picture employed here.

At large \u03be it\namounts to 0.1581(5) \u03be \u22120.542(2) (of course the same holds for the anti-merons).\nObviously large clusters have a higher probability to carry topological charge.\nIn the limit of a very large size s one finds 25% merons; around s = 2 \u03be one\nalready arrives approximately at this asymptotic number.\nTo provide an intuitive argument for this property, let us assume for\ninstance a direction ~r = (0, 1), and we measure the spin angles \u03c6j \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]\n~l . . . S\n~k\nrelative to the x-axis. Again we consider some cluster with the spins S\nand we assume \u03c6l \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2). Now the spin angles of this cluster describe a\ndiscrete path in (0, \u03c0). For large \u03be (resp. large \u03b2) the relative angles \u2206\u03c6j of\nadjacent spins are small. In particular we can assume the continuum limit\nto be approached to a point where the probability for any |\u2206\u03c6j | \u2265 \u03c0/2 is\nnegligible. Hence for small clusters \u03c6k is likely to be in (0, \u03c0/2) as well,\nso that the cluster is neutral. However, in very large clusters \u03c6l becomes\nirrelevant for the endpoint \u03c6k , which can be in (0, \u03c0/2) or in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0) with\nequal probability. This implies an equal number of neutral clusters and\nmerons. Analogously, large clusters with \u03c6l \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0) are equally likely to\nbe neutral or anti-merons.\nTo quantify the increase of the meron density as s rises, we specified three\ndensities and Table 1 displays the corresponding sizes s.\n\n3.3\n\nEfficiency\n\nFor comparison, we consider as a unit of computation time a process that\ncould modify the whole chain: for the multi-cluster algorithm, this is what\n\n9\n\n\fwe have described before as one algorithmic step; for Metropolis, it means\none sweep to tackle each spin in the chain. We repeat that we performed\nour tests at a chain length L \u2243 20 * \u03be, so that finite size effects are strongly\nsuppressed.8\n\nthermalisation time \u03c4therm\n\n1000\n\n100\n\nMetropolis\nfit : 7*exp(\u03be/2.4)\nmulti-cluster\nfit : 16*\u03be0.51\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 2: The thermalisation time \u03c4therm for the energy as a function of the\ncorrelation length \u03be. In the multi-cluster simulation \u03c4therm increases only\nslowly in \u03be, which is in contrast to the Metropolis algorithm. The results are\naveraged over a variety of cold and hot starts.\nFirst we consider the thermalisation time with respect to the energy.\nFor the Metropolis algorithm \u03c4therm grows exponentially with the correlation\nlength, \u03c4therm \u2243 7(2) exp(\u03be/2.4(2)). On the other hand the data for the\nmulti-cluster algorithm follow a power law, \u03c4therm \u2243 16(2)\u03be 0.51(7) as shown in\nFigure 2. In particular this ensures a striking advantage at large \u03be, when we\napproach the continuum limit.\nWe proceed to the stage where the thermalisation is completed and we\nconsider now the (exponential) auto-correlation time \u03c4a , again with respect\nto the energy. Hence the auto-correlation function is fitted with exp(\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4a ),\nwhere \u03c4 is the algorithmic time. The values of \u03c4a are plotted in Figure 3 (on\nthe left) at various \u03be for the multi-cluster algorithm; we observe \u03c4a \u221d \u03be \u03b3 with\na dynamical critical exponent \u03b3 = 0.52(3).\nFor the Metropolis simulation, the data can be fitted well with a sum of\ntwo exponentials, c exp(\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4a1 ) + (1 \u2212 c) exp(\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4a2 ), and Figure 3 (on the\nright) shows the corresponding results \u03c4a1 and \u03c4a2 .

It\ncan be fitted with two exponentials, with a dominant exponent of 1.89.\nexponents amount to 1.89(6) and 0.89(4). What ultimately matters is the\ndominant exponent \u2248 2, which is reminiscent of the random walk diffusion\nof local changes on the chain.\nFor the (squared) topological charge (\u03bd (g) ) 2 (which is relevant for \u03c7t ),\nthe growth of the auto-correlation time is exponential with Metropolis, as\nFigure 4 shows. On the other hand, the auto-correlation practically vanishes\nwith the multi-cluster algorithm. This de-correlation is due to the largescale changes performed on the chain. The multi-cluster algorithm reveals\nhere most clearly its potential in overcoming the critical slowing down.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nResults for the observables\nCorrelation length \u03be\n\nIn Subsection 3.2 the correlation length (at \u03b8 = 0) has been anticipated.\nWe now consider its relation to the inverse temperature \u03b2.

On the right we add results for \u03be at\nnon-zero vacuum angles \u03b8.

Figure 7 (on the right) shows\nits dependence on L for various values of \u03b8. (To set the scale, we still refer\nto \u03be at \u03b8 = 0.) It converges for large L to the value of \u03c7t (0), for any \u03b8 6= \u03c0.\nThis convergence slows down as \u03b8 rises, and it collapses at \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nSuch precise results for a system with a complex action are very rare; other\nexamples with a \u03b8-term were obtained with the meron cluster algorithm for\nthe 2d O(3) model [9] and for an SU(N) quantum spin ladder [20].9\n\n4.3\n\nThe topological susceptibility from cooling\n\nFor comparison we also consider this susceptibility based on topological\ncharges obtained from \"cooling\" [22]; we denote it as \u03c7t,cool . To this end,\nthe chain is smoothed before a measurement: a spin is chosen at random\nand rotated so that the action is minimised. This process is iterated until it\nconverges. In lattice gauge theory a long cooling process (for the plaquettes)\nultimately leads to the trivial configuration, so one tries to read off a topological charge from some earlier plateau (for instance by monitoring the energy).\nHere the situation is simpler because the cooled configuration stabilises, so\n\u03bd (cool) is (in this sense) unambiguous. The question remains how it is related\nto the original configuration, which has the correct statistical weight (unlike\nthe cooled configuration). We may compare the cooled charge to the original\ngeometrical charge \u03bd (g) , with the obvious inequality |\u03bd (cool) | \u2264 |\u03bd (g) |. The\nultimate criterion is how well \u03c7t,cool approximates the continuum value of \u03c7t .\nThe result is plotted Figure 8. The convergence of \u03c7t,cool to the continuum\nlimit is just as quick as for the geometrical charge without cooling.\n\n4.4\n\nMagnetic susceptibility \u03c7m\n\nFigure 9 (on the left) shows our results for the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7m , see\neq. (2.8). They are in excellent agreement with the approximation given in\neq. (2.10).

On the left\nwe show the result at \u03b8 = 0, which follows the formula (2.10) to an excellent\naccuracy. The plot on the right is our result for \u03c7m (\u03b8)/\u03be(\u03b8). The data are\nreliable over the plotted range, before getting too close to \u03c0. This result was\naccessible with the multi-cluster algorithm along with an improved estimator.\nAt non-zero \u03b8, the result emerges from re-weighting the data of \u03b8 = 0\naccording to the prescription in Ref. [23]. The results are shown in Figure\n9 on the right. We applied an improved estimator by flipping a number of\nclusters. Here we do consider the \u03b8-dependence of the correlation length,\nwhich is used to build the dimensionless ratio plotted in Figure 9. It grows\nrapidly as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0, cf. Figure 5, hence we involved quite long spin\nchains. Once \u03be(\u03b8) exceeds L, the considered ratio drops towards 0, as we see\n15\n\n\ffrom eq. (2.9). However, for a continuum limit \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0 which respects L \u226b \u03be\nthe plateau at relatively large \u03b8 suggests a value \u03c7m (\u03b8)/\u03be(\u03b8) \u2248 1.\nIn one case, \u03b2 = 5, L = 300, we indicate jackknife errors. In the other\ncases they are similar, i.e. again very small up to the close vicinity of \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nThis is very remarkable in view of the generic difficulties to obtain numerical\nresults for models with a significant imaginary part in the Euclidean action.\nThe statistics includes several millions of configurations, and it is still\nenhanced thanks to the improved estimator. In particular, statistics in a\nfixed topological sector can be cumulated by flipping neutral clusters. In\nthis way it could be simulated within a few weeks on a 2 GHz machine; with\nthe Metropolis algorithm this measurement is hardly feasible.\n\n5\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nWe presented a new and successful application of the meron cluster algorithm.\nIn the spin chains that we considered, it provides precise simulation results\nin a highly efficient way. We assigned a half-integer topological charge to\neach cluster, which is the basis of a powerful improved estimator. This yields\naccurate result for the present toy model with a \u03b8-term - an issue, which is\nstill outstanding in QCD.\nHere it was possible to suppress the notorious problem of critical slowing down. With respect to the topological charge we overcome this problem\ncompletely. Regarding the energy, the dynamical critical exponent is reduced\nby almost a factor of 4.\nThis provides a strong motivation to search for applications of this technique also in higher dimensions, i.e. in field theoretic models. In particular\nan application of the meron cluster algorithm in the 3d O(4) model appears\npromising - that model can be interpreted as an effective description of\nQCD with two light quark flavours at high temperature.\nWe add a very rough estimate about the feasibility of that project. If\n\u03be(\u03b8) behaves similarly to Figure 5, we control the finite size effects quite well\nup to \u03b8 \u2248 0.9 \u03c0 for instance with L = 32. Compared to the spin chains that\nwe considered to measure \u03c7m (\u03b8)/\u03be(\u03b8), this implies a factor of O(100) for the\nnumber of lattice sites (along with a factor of 6 for the generators of the\nsymmetry group). Tiny error bars as we obtained in Figure 9 (on the right)\nmay be relaxed without problems, say by a factor >\n\u223c 3, so that the required\n16\n\n\fstatistics decreases by an order of magnitude. Comparing now to the computational effort which was necessary in d = 1 (cf. last paragraph in Section 4),\nand considering the option to use a number of processors simultaneously, we\nestimate that the 3d O(4) model at finite \u03b8 can be solved to a good precision\nwith the meron cluster algorithm within less than one year.\nAcknowledgements: We thank Michael M\u00fcller-Preussker, Andr\u00e9 Sternbeck, Jan Volkholz, Uwe-Jens Wiese and Ulli Wolff for useful comments.
