Among the\npossible collisionally induced populations, Blue Stragglers Stars (BSS) are surely the most\nstudied. BSS were first discovered by Sandage (1953) in M3. In recent years the realization\nthat BSS are the ideal diagnostic for a quantitative evaluation of the effects of dynamical\ninteractions inside star clusters has led to a remarkable burst of activity in the search for and\nthe systematic study of BSS in clusters. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),\nwith its high angular resolution and UV imaging capabilities, has made it possible to search\nfor candidates BSS in the cores of highly concentrated GGCs.\nWithin this framework we are performing an extensive HST-UV survey in the cores of a\nselected sample of GGCs searching for various products of binary evolution. In particular, we\nare constructing an homogeneous database of BSS in the UV-bands. Some results have been\nalready published in a series of papers presenting the BSS content in individual clusters\n(see Ferraro et al. 1997a, 1999a, 2001 and Paltrinieri et al. 1998, Bellazzini et al. 2002,\nFerraro, Paltrinieri & Cacciari, 1999, for a review). In this series of papers we empirically\ndemonstrated that UV-CMDs are the most appropriate planes for the study of BSS.\nIn this paper, we present a direct comparison of the BSS content in six intermediate to\nhigh density (log \u03c10 \u223c 2\u20135.4) GGCs with intermediate to low metallicity: M13 (NGC 6205),\nM10 (NGC 6254), M80 (NGC 6093), M3 (NGC 5272), M92(NGC 6341) and NGC 288. In\n\u00a73 we present the BSS samples discovered in each cluster on the basis of the UV-CMDs, and\nwe discuss the properties and the radial distributions of BSS with respect to normal cluster\nstars. In \u00a74 we present the comparison of the BSS distribution in the UV-CMDs with that\nexpected from theoretical collisional models.\n1\n\nBased on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope\nScience Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data analysis\n\nThe data-set used in this work consist of a series of HST-WFPC2 exposures covering\nthe central regions of six GGCs: M3, M10, M13, M80, M92 and NGC 288. In Table 1\nwe summarized the main characteristics of each cluster: metallicity ([Fe/H]) from Zinn &\nWest (1984), central density (\u03c10 and mass (from Trager & Meylan 1993), distance (d) (from\nFerraro et al. 1999b), and central dispersion velocity (\u03c30 ) (from Trager & Meylan 1993). For\neach cluster, the Planetary Camera (PC) was roughly centered on the cluster center (in the\ncase of NGC 288 the cluster center was outside the field of view of the PC - see Figure 1\nby Bellazzini et al. 2002). By adopting this observational strategy a significant fraction of\nthe cluster luminosity has been sampled with a single HST pointing, In Table 3 (column\n2) the fraction of the cluster luminosity sampled (LS /LT ) in each cluster is reported. Here\nwe present the results obtained using the mid-UV (F255W) and near-UV (F336W) filters,\nthose best suited for picking out BSS. Table 2 lists the total duration of the exposures in\neach filter for the six clusters.\nAll the photometric reductions (with the exception of NGC 288; see Bellazzini et\nal. 2002) have been carried out using ROMAFOT (Buonanno et al. 1983), a package specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded fields. The standard procedure\ndescribed in Ferraro et al. (1997a) was adopted. More details on the reduction procedure\nand the entire dataset secured in these clusters can be found in some specific papers already\npublished (see for example Ferraro et al. 1997a for M3 and Ferraro et al. 1999a for M80).\nBriefly, the images in the same filter were aligned and combined in order to obtain a median\nimage in each filter. We used the combined F255W image as reference frame for searching\nthe objects in each field. Then the PSF fitting procedure was separately performed on each\nindividual frame, and an average magnitude was computed for each star. The instrumental\nmagnitudes were finally transformed into the STMAG system, using Table 9 of Holtzmann\net al. (1995).\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nIn the UV cluster light is dominated by hot stars, specifically the blue HB stars and the\nBSS. (see for example Figure 1 by Ferraro, Paltrinieri & Cacciari 1999). Since the BSS are\none of the hottest sub-populations in the cluster, they are easily separated from the cooler\nTurn-Off and SGB stars. Indeed, in previous papers (Ferraro et al. 1997a, 1999a, 2001 and\nPaltrinieri et al. 1998, Ferraro, Paltrinieri & Cacciari, 1999) we have shown that UV-CMDs,\nin particular the (m255 , m255 \u2212 m336 ) plane, are ideal for selecting BSS.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nFigure 1 shows the (m255 , m255 \u2212 m336 ) CMDs for the six clusters. More than 50,000\nstars are plotted in the six panels of Figure 1. As can be seen, in this plane, the BSS\npopulations define a clean and well-defined sequence spanning \u223c 3 mag in m255 . Further,\nthey are clearly distinguishable from SGB-TO stars. In order to select the BSS samples we\nfollowed the same criteria that we adopted for M3. In Ferraro et al. (1997a), the global\npopulation of BSS was divided in two sub-samples: (a) bright BSS with m255 < 19 and\n(b) faint BSS with 19.0 < m255 < 19.4. To apply the same criteria to the other clusters\nshown in Figure 1, the CMD of each cluster has been shifted to match that of M3 by using\nthe brightest portion of the HB as the normalization region. Figure 1 shows the UV-CMD\nafter the alignment. Thus, the solid horizontal line (at m255 = 19) in the figure shows the\ncut-off magnitude for the bBSS sample. In this paper we are comparing the BSS content in\nclusters with quite different structural parameters. The level of difficulty in the detecting\nand the measuring of (especially faint) BSS varies from cluster to cluster. Thus, we decided\nto compare the samples by using only the bright BSS samples (hereafter bBSS). The number\nof bright BSS (NbBSS ) identified in each cluster is listed in Table 3.\n\n3.1.\n\nbBSS radial distribution\n\nAs pointed out by many authors most BSS in GGCs are found to be centrally concentrated with respect to normal stars. Since the central relaxation time in these systems is\nmuch less than the cluster age, this result is generally ascribed to dynamical mass segregation and can be interpreted as an evidence that BSS are more massive than the comparison\nstars.\nWe have determined the radial distributions of the bBSS of the six GGCs using the\nRGB stars (from the tip down to the SGB ) as a \"reference\" population. The RGB stars\nhave been selected in the (m555 , m336 \u2212 m555 ) CMD, i.e. roughly a (V, U \u2212 V ) CMD in order\nto reduce any bias which might be introduced by the poor photometry for the very red stars\nin the UV bands. The cumulative radial distributions for the bBSS and the RGB stars are\nplotted in Figure 2 as a function of the projected distance (r) from the cluster center. It is\nevident from the plots that the BSS (solid line) are significantly more centrally concentrated\nthan RGB stars (dotted line) in M3, M92 and M80. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has been\napplied to the two distributions, in each cluster, to check the statistical significance of the\ndetected differences. The test yields the probability that the bBSS population and the RGB\nstars are extracted from the same parent distribution. The probability values obtained in\neach cluster are reported in Figure 2. The effect is strongly statistically significant in the\ncase of M3, M92 and M80. For NGC 288 and M10 the BSS are more concentrated that the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nRGB but the results are significant at only roughly the 2\u03c3 and 1\u03c3 levels respectively.\nAt first glance the radial distribution of the BSS in M13 appears to be indistinguishable\nfrom the other cluster stars. Since it is difficult to imagine any BSS formation scenario\nin which the BSS are not at least somewhat centrally condensed, we have more carefully\nexamined the role of the small M13 bBSS sample. A series of Monte Carlo simulations have\nbeen performed in which 103 subsamples of the same number of the bBSS population found\nin M13 (16) have been randomly extracted from the M3 bBSS population (72). Then, the\nradial distribution of each subsample was compared with that of the RGB stars of M3. A\nKS test has been applied to quantify the significance of the differences. In these simulations\ndrawn from a sample in which the central concentration of the BSS has been convinvingly\nshown, 40% of the M13-like samples have p > 20% that the BSS and RGB have the same\ndistribution. Less than 10% have as a convincing a case for different distributions as in\nM3. About 6% of the M13-like samples have p as large as for the true M13 comparison.\nIn another test, two M13 BSS were arbitrary moved from the middle of the distribution to\nthe inner part and p dropped from 0.77 to 0.34. We conclude that the M13 bBSS sample is\ntoo small to make a definitive statement about its central concentration. Our M13 results\nare consistent with no central concentration, but they are not inconsistent with a central\nconcentration even as large as that of M3.\nThe case of NGC 288 deserves a short comment since the location of the center in this\ncluster is quite uncertain. The radial distribution plotted above could be affected by large\nuncertanties. In accordance with Bellazzini et al. (2002) we adopted the coordinates listed by\nWebbink (1985), and the cluster center turns out to be located just outside the field-of-view\nof the PC (see their Figure 1).\nBSS\nWe can make an additional quantitative comparison by using the parameters r1/2\n(the\nradius containing half the bBSS sample) and fRGB (the fraction of the total RGB sample\nBSS\nBSS\nand fRGB are listed in Table 3 along with the core\n). Values for r1/2\ncontained within r1/2\nradius (rc ). With the exception of NGC 288 (for which we took the value from Trager,\nDjorgovski & King, 1993), the rc was independently determined in each cluster by fitting a\nKing model to the observed density profile (see for example Figure 4 in Ferraro et al. 1999a).\nThese values confirm the general impression from Figure 2,that the BSS are much more\nconcentrated than the RGB in M80, M3 and M92. Thus, even considering the brightest part\nof the BSS distribution in M80, we have fully confirmed the previous results by Ferraro et\nal. 1999a, who suggested that the BSS in M80 are the most concentrated population observed\nin a GGCs.\n\nIn Figure 3 the magnitude distributions (equivalent to a luminosity function-LF) of\nbBSS for the six clusters are compared. In doing this we use the parameter \u03b4m255 defined\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nas the magnitude of each bBSS (after the alignment showed in Figure 1) with respect to the\nmagnitude threshold (assumed at m255 = 19 - see Figure 1). Then \u03b4m255 = mbBSS\n\u2212 19.0.\n255\nFrom the comparison shown in Figure 3 (panel(a)) the bBSS magnitude distributions for M3\nand M92 appear to be quite similar and both significantly different from those obtained in\nthe other clusters. This is essentially because in both these two clusters the bBSS magnitude\ndistribution seems to have a tail extending to brighter magnitudes (the bBSS magnitude tip\nreaches \u03b4m255 \u223c \u22122.5). A KS test applied to these two distributions yields a probability of\n93% that they are extracted from the same distribution. In panel(b) we see that the bBSS\nmagnitude distribution of M13, M10 and M80 are essentially indistinguishable from each\nother and significantly different from M3 and M92. A KS test applied to the three LFs\nconfirms that they are extracted from the same parent distribution. Moreover, a KS test\napplied to the total LFs obtained by combining the data for the two groups: M3 and M92\n(group(a)), and M13, M80 and M10 (group(b)) shows that the the bBSS-LFs of group(a)\nand group(b) are not compatible (at 3\u03c3 level).\nIt is interesting to note that the clusters grouped on the basis of bBSS-LFs have some\nsimilarities in their HB morphology. The three clusters of group(b) have an extended HB\nblue tail; the two clusters of group(a) have no HB extention. Could there be a connection\nbetween the bBSS photometric properties and the HB morphology? This possibility needs\nto be further investigated.\nFinally we note that the magnitude function for the bBSS in NGC 288 (solid line in\npanel (b)) is significantly different than that of all the other clusters.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpecific Frequency\n\nIn order to properly compare the BSS populations in different clusters, the BSS number\nmust be normalized to account for the size of the total cluster population. For this reason\nwe have defined various specific frequencies. In Ferraro, Fusi Pecci & Bellazzini (1995)\nwe used S4BSS (the BSS number normalized to the integrated bolometric luminosity of the\nsurveyed region in units of 104 L\u2299 ). Analogously, in Ferraro et al. (1999a) we defined a more\nappropriate specific frequency:\nBSS\nFHB\n=\n\nNBSS\nNHB\n\nwhere NBSS is the number of BSS and NHB is the number of HB stars in the same area. The\ntwo ratios are similar, since in absence of any special segregation of HB stars with respect\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nto the \"normal\" cluster-star, the observed number of HB stars NHB is an excellent indicator\nof the sampled cluster luminosity. In fact, the simple relation by Renzini & Buzzoni (1986):\nNj = B(t)LS tj\neasily links the number of stars sampled in any post main sequence stage (Nj ) with the sampled cluster luminosity (LS ) and the duration of the phase (tj ). B(t) is the specific flux of the\n\u22121\npopulation. Following Renzini & Buzzoni (1986) we assume B(t) \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 stars L\u22121\n\u2299 yr\nfor an old population of 1010 yr.\nThus, assuming tHB \u223c 108 yr, we can expect to sample 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 HB stars for each solar\nluminosity sampled in a given stellar population.\nBSS\nThe FHB\nratio has the advantage that it is a purely observative quantity and it can be\neasily computed in the UV-CMDs since the HB population is quite bright in these planes and\nthe HB sequence is well separated from the other branches. However, while in the following\nBSS\ndiscussion we will mainly use the FHB\nratio, the S4BSS is also computed for each cluster and\nthe values are listed in Table 3 for sake of comparison.\n\nAs discussed in Section 3 we consider only the bright BSS, hence NbBSS is the number\nof bright bBSS (according to the original definition by Ferraro et al. (1997a)). The values\nbBSS\nbBSS\nof FHB\nare listed in Table 3. As can be seen FHB\nvaries by a factor 13 from M13 to NGC\n288. Interesting enough NGC 288, the cluster with the lowest central density, shows the\nlargest bBSS specific frequency. As already noted by Bellazzini et al. (2002) this cluster\nturns out to have as many bBSS as HB stars over the sampled area. Though the number\nbBSS\nof bBSS detected in the cluster is intrinsically small (\u223c 30) the result is surprising: FHB\nis comparable with what found in the central region of the core-collapsing cluster M80 by\nbBSS\nFerraro et al. (1999a). If we consider only the PC field of view, the FHB\nin M80 rises up to\n0.7.\nThe central density of a cluster is not the only factor which determines the number\nof collision products we expect to see. Collisions involving binary star systems are more\nlikely than collisions between single stars and have a significant probability of producing a\nstellar merger. We used equation 14 from Leonard (1989) in order to estimate the number\nof binary-binary (bb) encounters occuring per Gyr (Nbb ) in the core of each cluster listed in\nTable 1. Adopting the distance modulus listed in Table 1, the rc listed in Table 3, \u03c30 and the\ncentral density Log(\u03c10 ) listed in Table 1 (from Pryor & Meylan (1993)), assuming an average\nmass of 0.2M\u2299 (Kroupa 2001), we computed tbb (the mean interval between collisions) from\nequation (14) by Leonard (1989) and derived the expected number of encounters, per Gyr,\nas a function of the binary fraction (fb ) in the core.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIn doing this, the semimajor axis which separates hard from soft binaries (ahs ) has been\ncomputed for each cluster according to the following relation:\nahs =\n\nGM\n9\u03c302\n\nderived by combining equation 4 of Leonard & Linnell (1992) with the Kepler's third law.\nThe semimajor axes computed for each cluster and expressed in AU are listed in Table 4.\nFollowing Leonard (1989) we multiplied tbb by a factor of two in order to take into\naccount the fact that not all encounters lead to a physical collision. The rate of single-binary\ncollisions can also be estimated from Leonard's results. In his equation 8 if one assumes\nthat the pericenter distance is proportional to binary semimajor axis, like in binary-binary\ncollisions, and that M1 = M\u22c6 , M2 (binary) = 1.5 M\u22c6 , one finds a factor of 5 instead of his\n6 in the cross section. Thus the number of single-binary encounters is roughly the 5/6 the\nnumber of binary-binary encounters.\nIn Table 4 we list the results with three different fb values, respectively 0.2 and 1.00.\nThese values should be considered as indications of the effectiveness of physical collisions in\nthe cluster cores. It is clear that the bb (or sb) collision channel is more than one order of\nmagnitude more efficient in a dense cluster like M80 than in a low density cluster like NGC\n288. Therefore, the high specific frequency of blue stragglers in NGC 288 suggests that the\nbinary fraction in NGC 288 is much higher than the binary fraction in M80. Only then would\none expect a similar encounter frequency in the two clusters. Note that a cluster like M80\nmay have originally had a higher binary fraction but because of the efficiency of encounters,\nthose primordial binaries were \"used up\" early in the history of the cluster, producing some\ncollisional BSS which have evolved away from the MS (see for example the evolved E-BSS\npopulation found in M3 and M80 by Ferraro 1997a, 1999a).\nWe should note that on the basis of the simulation results shown in Figure 8 and in\nTable 4 the binary-binary channel can still account for the number of the BSS observed in\nNGC288 if a large enough percentage of binary fraction is assumed to reside in the core.\nHowever, without invoking ad hoc binary content, a more natural explanation for\nthe origin of BSS in NGC 288 (as discussed in Bellazzini et al. (2002)) is the mass transfer\nprocess in primordial binary systems (Carney et al 2001). Here we probably have another\nconfirmation of the scenario suggested by Fusi Pecci et al. (1992, and references therein):\nBSS living in different environments have different origins.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n\nCollisional Models\n\nFrom our sample of six clusters with rather diverse bBSS populations we can select pairs\nwith similarities in parameters like density, metallicity, velocity dispersion, or we can search\nfor trends in bBSS populations as some parameter varies. There are two quite striking and\nunsuspected results. First, the two clusters at the high and low density extremes, M80 and\nNGC 288, have the largest bBSS specific frequencies. Second, two clusters which are in most\nways quite similar, M3 and M13, have very different bBSS populations.\nTo aid our understanding of the BSS populations in these clusters, we present a comparison of the photometric characteristics of the BSS observed in the selected clusters with some\ncollisional models. The models we used in this paper are described in detail in Sills & Bailyn\n(1999), and have been applied to 47 Tucanae (Sills et al. 2000). We assume that the blue\nstragglers in the central regions of the six clusters are all formed through stellar collisions\nbetween single stars during an encounter between a single star and a binary system. While\nbinary-binary collisions may well be important, we do not currently have the capability of\nmodeling the BSS they might produce. The trajectories of the stars during the collision are\nmodeled using the STARLAB software package (McMillan & Hut 1996). The masses of the\nstars involved are chosen randomly from a mass function for the current cluster and a different mass function which governs the mass distribution within the binary system. A binary\nfraction, and a distribution of semi-major axes must also be assumed. The output of these\nsimulations is the probability that a collision between stars of specific masses will occur.\nWe have chosen standard values for the mass functions (dN(M) \u221d m\u2212(1+x) dM) and binary\ndistribution. The current mass function has an index x = \u22122, and the mass distribution\nwithin the binary systems are drawn from a Salpeter mass function (x = 1.35). We chose a\nbinary fraction of 20% and a binary period distribution which is flat in log P . The total stellar density was taken from the central density of each cluster. The effect of changing these\nvalues is explored in Sills & Bailyn (1999). The collision products are modeled by entropy\nordering of gas from colliding stars (Sills & Lombardi 1997) and evolved from these initial\nconditions using the Yale stellar evolution code YREC (Guenther et al. 1992). The models\nreported here used a metallicity of [Fe/H] = \u22121.6, which is approximately correct for 4 of\nthe clusters investigated in this paper. BSS populations should not be strongly dependent\non metallicity. By weighting the resulting evolutionary tracks by the probability that the\nspecific collision will occur, we obtain a predicted distribution of BSS in the color-magnitude\ndiagram.\nIn order to explore the effects of non-constant BSS formation rates, we considered a\nseries of truncated rates. In these models we assumed that the BSS formation rate was\nconstant for some portion of the cluster lifetime, and zero otherwise. This assumption is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nobviously unphysical-the relevant encounter rates would presumably change smoothly on\ntimescales comparable to the relaxation time. However these models do demonstrate how the\ndistribution of BSS in the color-magnitude diagram depends on when the BSS were created,\nand thus provide a basis for understanding more complicated and realistic formation rates.\n\n4.1.\n\nComparisons with data\n\nSome comparisons between the models and the HST observations are shown in figures\n4\u20138. In figures 4, 5 and 6, we compare our theoretical predictions to the BSS population\nof M80. The theoretical predictions have been normalized by the total number of predicted\nblue stragglers for each cluster; this allows us to more easily compare the shapes of the distributions. Figure 4 is an example of the predicted distribution of BSS in the m255 , m255 \u2212m336\ncolor-magnitude diagram for M80. The theoretical predictions are shown as greyscale contours, with the darker colors indicating more BSS in that region of the CMD. The observed\nblue stragglers are shown as crosses. Each of the panels is a different assumption for the BSS\nformation rate, as indicated on the top of the panel. The differences between the models can\nbe understood in terms of lifetimes of the individual collision products which make up the\ndistributions. For example, if BSS production stopped 5 Gyr ago (center panel), we predict\nthat there should be no observed bBSS at present because all the massive BSS would have\nhad time to evolve off to the giant branch. At the other extreme, if all the BSS were formed\nin the last Gyr (panel marked \"1 Gyr to now\"), only a few of the very brightest (i.e. most\nmassive) would have even started moving towards the subgiant branch. It is worth pointing\nout that the brightest BSS shown in these predictions are not on the standard zero age\nmain sequence, but begin their lives to the red. These are stars which were formed from the\nmerger of two fairly evolved main sequence stars, and so they do not have enough hydrogen\nfuel left at their cores after the merger to return to the ZAMS (Sills et al. 1997).\nFigure 5 gives the luminosity function for each of the model distributions for M80. The\ndata are shown as the solid line, while the dotted line is the theoretical prediction for the\nformation times shown on the top of each panel. The luminosity functions are good probes\nof the mass distribution of blue stragglers, since the correlation between mass and luminosity\nis quite tight. The luminosity functions show, as do the CMD distributions, that bright BSS\nrequire recent formation. They also show that the relative numbers of brighter and fainter\nbBSS is not correct in our models. If we model the fainter bBSS very well (as in the panel\nmarked \"stopped 2 Gyr ago\"), then our models under-predict the number of blue stragglers\nbetween m255 = 17 and 18.\nFigure 6 gives the equivalent \"temperature function\" for M80. This is the cumulative\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nnumber of stars in each color (i.e. temperature) bin, in direct analogy to the luminosity\nfunction. The distribution of blue stragglers in color can be used to study the age or age\nspread of the BSS. Evolutionary tracks for stars of these masses are confined to a fairly\nnarrow range in luminosity between the main sequence and the base of the giant branch,\nso the luminosity function does not give the entire picture. The temperature function is\nuseful for distinguishing between populations which have lots of main sequence stars and\npopulations with many subgiants. As in figure 5, the data are shown as the solid line, while\nthe dotted line is the theoretical prediction for the formation times shown on the top of each\nbox.\nWe performed KS tests on the luminosity and temperature functions for each cluster\nand each theoretical distribution. Figures 7 and 8 gives the best fit model distribution for\neach cluster, its luminosity function, and its temperature function. We will comment on\neach cluster individually here, and then draw some general conclusions in the next section.\nM80: The fainter bBSS are very well fit by a distribution in which formation was truncated about 2 Gyr ago. However, there is a significant population of BSS which extends up\nto 2.5 magnitudes above the turnoff, which is not predicted by such a model and which suggests that some BSS formation continues until the present. Ferraro et al. (1999a) suggested\nthat the large BSS population in M80 is due to the stellar interactions which are delaying\nthe core collapse process. Now we add the evidence that many of these BSS are relatively old\n(t > 2 Gyr). These results together suggest that the process of holding off the core collapse\ncan be rather extended.\nM10: The BSS in this cluster are fit by different formation models in the temperature\nand luminosity planes. However, the difference between the KS probability for the best fit\nto luminosity function (BSS formation ended 2 Gyr ago) and the best fit for temperature\nfunction (BSS formation ended 1 Gyr ago) is small. The luminosity function has a 16%\nprobability of being drawn from the first distribution, and a 10% probability of being drawn\nfrom the second distribution.\nM13: Of all the clusters in this paper, this one is the most believable for showing a\ntruncated BSS distribution. There is no evidence for very bright BSSs close to the main\nsequence. The only BSS brighter than \u03b4m255 = 2.5 is very red, consistent with an evolved\nobject.\nM3: None of the collisional models fit this cluster very well. The best fit for the\nluminosity function, as shown in figure 8, is a model in which the BSS stopped forming\nabout 1 Gyr ago (3% KS probability). However, the temperature function for the same\nmodel has almost zero probability of being drawn from the same distribution as the data,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nand the best fit temperature function is the scenario in which the BSS stopped forming 2\nGyr ago. In all cases, including the models which predict BSS formation right up to the\npresent day, we under-predict the number of very bright blue stragglers.\nM92: The best fit to both the luminosity and temperature functions is a model in\nwhich the BSS formation was truncated 1 Gyr ago. However, there are also very bright\nblue stragglers in this cluster, suggesting that blue straggler formation has continued to the\npresent day or that the blue stragglers produced in this cluster are not well modeled by\ncollisions between two stars.\nNGC 288: This cluster is significantly different from the previous 5, in that we do not\nexpect that the BSS formed in this cluster are the products of stellar collisions. The density\nis simply too low. We also know that the binary fraction in the core is measured to be\n\u223c 10 to 38% (Bellazzini et al. 2002), so BSS formed in this low density cluster should be\nthe result of binary evolution rather than stellar collisions. By assuming that binary merger\nBSS are similar to collisional BSS we can still expore the BSS formation history in NGC 288.\nThe best fit distribution for this cluster, at the 65% level, is achieved when the BSS were\nformed at a constant rate over the entire lifetime of the cluster, right up to the present day.\nThis result is significantly different from the other five clusters investigated in this paper.\nPerhaps, it could be an indication of the different formation histories of binary mergers and\ncollisions. It is also possible that the difference between this cluster and the other 5 could\nbe a result of different evolutionary tracks for binary merger and collision products.\n\n4.2.\n\nIndications and Trends\n\nThe first conclusion that we draw from the models is that since we are limiting our\nstudy to BSS brighter than the limit of m255 = 19.0, we have no information about BSS\nformation earlier than about 5 Gyr ago. On the other hand, we can state with certainty\nthat BSS have been formed in all these clusters during the last 5 Gyr. In all clusters, this\nformation is not confined to the very recent past; rather, it has lasted over the entire time\nthat we can probe, and in fact seems to be concentrated at earlier epochs.\nThe KS tests on the luminosity and temperature functions give the best results for\ndistributions in which BSS stopped forming 1\u20132 Gyr ago in all clusters except NGC 288.\nThese \"best\" fits are clearly not good fits, however. In most of the clusters, there is a\npopulation of bright BSS that was formed more recently. Our models consistently underpredict the number of bright BSS compared to the number of fainter, redder BSS. There are\na number of possible reasons.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nThe first, and most likely, discrepancy is in the formation rate of blue stragglers. We\nhave assumed a constant formation rate over the some times, and zero otherwise. If, instead,\nblue stragglers were formed at some (more or less) constant rate between 5 and 2 Gyr ago,\nand then experienced a reduced (but not zero) blue straggler formation rate to the present\nday, the predicted distribution would match the observations better. It is very unlikely that\nthe blue straggler formation rate changes sharply between zero and a constant value. Rather,\nthe formation rate is going to be smoother function of central density, velocity dispersion,\nsingle star mass function and the number and nature of binary systems in the cluster. The\nsimple models used in this paper should be taken as indications of formation eras only.\nIt is also possible that the stellar evolutionary models which go into these blue straggler\ndistributions are not accurate. If we were overestimating the lifetimes of the faint blue\nstragglers or underestimating the lifetimes of the bright blue stragglers, we would see this\nkind of mismatch between observations and data. It is difficult to understand how the\nevolutionary tracks would be overestimating the lifetimes of the faint blue stragglers. The\nlower the mass of the collision product, in general, the more similar it is to a normal star of\nthe same mass, and so its evolutionary track is very much like normal stars-something we\nunderstand quite well. In order to underestimate the lifetimes of the brighter blue stragglers,\nthe collision products would have to mix more hydrogen into their cores than is currently\npredicted. Rapid rotation is a plausible mechanism for this mixing, although we would have\nto have some process by which the lower mass BSS were not rotating as rapidly. It is also\npossible that the bright blue stragglers could actually be the merger of three stars rather\nthan two (as is expected to happen in binary-mediated collisions), and so our evolutionary\nmodels will not be applicable. The merger product of three 0.4 M\u2299 stars will have a higher\npercentage of hydrogen in its core than the product of two 0.6 M\u2299 stars, but approximately\nthe same mass.\nThe difference between M3 and M92 on one hand, and M10, M13 and M80 on the other\nis primarily the existence of a few very bright blue stragglers in the first group of clusters. In\nall 5 clusters, the blue stragglers fainter than about m255 = 18.5 are very well modeled by the\nsame distribution (a truncated formation scenario, suggesting that blue straggler formation\nrates should be weighted towards 3\u20135 Gyr ago). The fact that M3 and M92 are better fit\nby a formation scenario in which BSS formation ended more recently is simply a reflection\nof the number of very bright BSS in these clusters. These bright blue stragglers could be an\nindication of continued BSS formation, or of a different binary distribution (which produced\nmore triple collisions). M3 does have a significant population of BSS in the outer part of\nthe cluster which are thought to be the result of binary mergers (Ferraro et al. 1997a). This\nfact does set M3 apart from M13, M10, & M80, which have few exterior BSS. Unfortunately\nM92 also has few exterior BSS so they cannot be invoked to explain the M3/M92 similarity.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nAs noted in Section 3.1, another very interesting point is that M10, M13 and M80\n(which share a common BSS Luminosity function) all have blue tail components to their\nhorizontal branches, while M3, M92 and NGC 288 do not. M3 and M13 are also a classic\nsecond-parameter pair (see Ferraro et al. 1997c), referring to the difference in their horizontal\nbranch morphology without an obvious difference in any other cluster parameter: they have\nthe same metallicity, central density, total mass, and very similar velocity dispersions. (The\ntwo clusters may have slightly different ages, which may or may not affect horizontal branch\nmorphology-see Rey et al. 2001, Davidge & Courteau 1999, Ferraro et al. 1997c). From\nthese data, there is certainly a suggestion that BSS population could be connected to the\nsecond parameter. From the comparisons in this paper, it seems that it is not the total\nnumber of BSS or their specific frequency, but rather the kind of BSS which are produced in\n\"blue tail\" clusters which is different from those produced in non-blue tail clusters. If this\nlink between BSS and horizontal branch morphology is real, then it suggests that the second\nparameter could be related to either stellar collisions and encounters, or to binary evolution.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have compared the blue straggler distribution in six galactic globular\nclusters: M3, M10, M13, M80, M92 and NGC 288. The blue stragglers were observed in\nthe HST UV filters F255W and F336W. The clusters have similar total masses, and velocity dispersions; have intermediate to low metallicities and span a range in central density.\nWe studied the properties of the blue stragglers relative to other cluster populations; and\nwe compared the observed blue straggler distributions with theoretical models of collision\nproducts in globular clusters.\nWhether they formed via a collisional channel or a merged primoridial binary channel,\nBSS are the most massive stars in GGCs other than neutron stars or possibly some white\ndwarfs. Since dynamical relaxation times are typically shorter than BSS lifetimes they should\nsettle toward the cluster center. BSS formed from merged primordial binaries have the entire\ncluster lifetime to settle. Collisions occur most often in high density regions and most often\ninvolve binaries providing yet another reason to expect BSS to be found near cluster centers.\nIndeed, it is difficult to image a BSS formation scenario which would not lead to a centrally\ncondensed BSS distribution. Our results are consistent with this expectation: M3, M92,\n& M80 show strong central concentrations; the BSS in M10 and NGC 288 are most likely\ncentrally condensed; while the BSS in M13 could have the same distribution as the RGB,\nthey could also have a central concentration similar to that of M3. The small sample size is\nnot adequate to definitively determine the radial distribution.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe specific frequency of blue stragglers compared to the number of horizontal branch\nstars varies from 0.07 to 0.92 for these six clusters, and does not seem to be correlated with\ncentral density, total mass, velocity dispersion, or any other obvious cluster property. We do\nnot have measurements of the binary fraction in most of these clusters. Binary stars impact\nthe blue straggler populations in a number of ways. BSS can be formed from binary evolution\nin any environment, although binary systems in dense environments will be different from\nthose in sparse environments-close binaries will be hardened by encounters (increasing the\nnumber of \"binary merger\" BSS), but wide binaries are also disrupted (decreasing the number\nof \"binary merger\" BSS). The relative rates of these events is an important factor in looking\nat blue stragglers in clusters. Binary systems also facilitate close interactions between stars\nbecause they have a large cross section compared to single stars, so we expect that clusters\nwith a large binary fraction to have both more collisional and binary merger blue stragglers.\nFusi Pecci et al. (1992, and references therein) presented a qualitative interpretative\nscenario concerning the possible origin of BSS in GGCs. They suggest that BSS in loose\nclusters might be produced from coalescence of primordial binaries. In high density GGCs\n(depending on survival-destruction rate of primordial binaries) BSS might mostly arise from\nstellar interactions, particularly those which involve binaries (Ferraro, Fusi Pecci & Bellazzini, 1995). In this scenario one could find clusters where more than one mechanism is at work\nin generating BSS. In fact Ferraro et al. (1993, 1997a) found that the radial distribution and\nthe luminosity functions of BSS in the center of M3 are consistent with a collisional origin,\nwhile in the outer regions they are consistent with a primordial binary origin. The paucity\nof BSS in M13 suggests that either the primordial population of binaries in M13 was poor or\nthat most of them were destroyed. Alternatively, as suggested by Ferraro et al. (1997b), the\nmechanism producing BSS in the central region of M3 is more efficient than M13 because\nM3 and M13 are in different dynamical evolutionary phases.\nThe evidence shown above suggests that different channels of BSS formation should\nbe at work and/or a large difference in the binary fraction should be present in NGC 288\nin order to produce such a large BSS frequency in a cluster with such different structural\nparameters. Bellazzini et al. (2002) measured the binary fraction in the core of NGC 288 to\nbe between 10% and 38%. Similar measurements for M3, M13, and M80 will be extremely\nhelpful in solving this mystery.\nAccording to simple models, BSS formation occured in all clusters over last 5 Gyr at\nleast, and more were formed 2\u20135 Gyr ago than in the recent past. This result needs to\nbe tested using models of globular cluster evolution in which the feedback between stellar\ncollisions and cluster evolution is modeled explicitly. Our assumption of a BSS formation\nrate which is either constant or zero is unphysical, and more complicated models are clearly\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nrequired.\nFinally, we note the possible connection between horizontal branch morphology and blue\nstraggler population characteristics. Of our six clusters, three have HB blue tails (M10, M13,\nM80), and three do not. The three with blue tails have the same blue straggler luminosity\nfunction, which spans about 1.5 magnitudes compared to 2.5 magnitudes in M3 and M92.\nThis suggests that blue straggler populations and the horizontal branch second parameter\nmay be linked in some way, perhaps through the complicated world of binary systems and\ntheir effect on cluster evolution and populations.\nWe warmly thank Michele Bellazzini for useful discussions and the referee, Peter Leonard,\nfor the many helpful suggestions which significantly improved the presentation of the paper.

Horizontal and vertical shifts\nhave been applied to all CMDs in order to match the main sequences of M3. The horizontal\nsolid line corresponds to m255 = 19 in M3. The bright BSS candidates are marked as large\nempty circles.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Cumulative radial distributions for the bright BSS (solid line) with respect to the\nRGB stars (dashed line) as a function of their projected distance (r) from the cluster center\nfor each of the six clusters. The probability that the two populations are extracted from the\nsame distribution is also reported in each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Cumulative magnitude distributions for the bright BSS for each of the six clusters.\nThe \u03b4m255 parameter is the difference in magnitude with respect to the limit threashold\n(m255 = 19) for bright-BSS, see text. In Panel (a) the BSS distributions for M3 and M92\n(the two clusters for which the BSS distribution extends up to more than two magnitudes\nbrighter than the threashold) are compared. In Panel (b) the BSS magnitude distributions\nfor the other 4 clusters are plotted.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The distribution of bright blue stragglers in the color-magnitude diagram for\nM80, compared to theoretical distributions. The observations are plotted as crosses, and\nthe greyscale contours give the theoretical distributions, with darker colors indicating more\nblue stragglers. The different panels correspond to different eras of constant blue straggler\nformation, as indicated at the top of each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Luminosity functions for the bright blue stragglers in M80 (solid line), compared\nto theoretical predictions (dotted line). The different panels correspond to different eras of\nconstant blue straggler formation, as indicated at the top of each panel. The luminosity\nfunctions are good probes of the mass function of blue stragglers. This figure shows that the\ntheoretical models do not accurately model the relative numbers of fainter and brighter blue\nstragglers.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Temperature functions for the bright blue stragglers in M80 (solid line), compared\nto theoretical predictions (dotted line). The different panels correspond to different eras of\nconstant blue straggler formation, as indicated at the top of each panel. The temperature\nfunctions are good probes of the bulk evolutionary state of the population of blue straggler\nstars, indicating whether the stars are all on the main sequence (as in the panel marked \"1\nGyr to now\") or closer to the subgiant & giant branches (as in the panel marked \"stopped\n2 Gyr ago\"). The BSS in M80 show a significant spread in evolutionary state.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- The observed blue stragglers (crosses in the CMD, solid lines in the luminosity and\ntemperature functions) and the best fit theoretical distribution, as determined from KS tests\non the luminosity and temperature functions. This figure shows the results for M80, M10\nand M13. In all cases, the nominal best-fit distribution is one in which the blue stragglers\nstopped forming 2 Gyr ago. However, only for M13 is this actually plausible. M80, and\nto a lesser extent M10 were forming blue stragglers more recently than 2 Gyr ago, since\nwe see a population of BSS brighter than m255 = 18. On the other hand, the temperature\nfunction (i.e. the distribution of BSS in evolutionary state) is very well fit by this truncated\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Same as figure 7, for M3, M92 and NGC 288. M3 and M92 contain the brightest\nblue stragglers in our sample, and so the best-fit theoretical distribution is one in which young\nblue stragglers (up to 1 Gyr old) are found. However, because of the spread in temperature,\nthese clusters are best fit by a truncated blue straggler formation model, like M80, M10 and\nM13. NGC 288 is different from the previous 5 clusters-its blue straggler distribution is\nextremely well fit by a model which has had essentially constant blue straggler formation\nover the lifetime of the cluster right to the present day.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
