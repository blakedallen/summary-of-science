Observations of circumstellar discs\nin multiple wavelengths reveal the initial conditions for\nplanet formation (McCaughrean, Stapelfeldt & Close 2000;\nWilner & Lay 2000). Detection of extrasolar planets has\nprovided a diverse set of final states, including a statistically significant number of planets with masses comparable to that of Jupiter on orbits very close to their\nparent star, so-called 'Hot Jupiters' (for a review see\nMarcy & Butler 2000, and exoplanets.org for an up-todate catalogue). Formulating an acceptable theory of giant\nplanet formation in such an environment has proved difficult\n(Wuchterl, Guillot & Lissauer 2000, and references therein).\nInstead planet migration has become the standard theory to\nexplain these interesting companions.\nThe interaction between a gaseous disc and an embedded protoplanet is a complex, highly non-linear process. Several phenomena have been classified, including the accretion\n\u22c6 Email: gwl@u.washington.edu\n\u2020 High-resolution figures and movies can be obtained at\nhpcc.astro.washington.edu/grads/gwl/disc_planet_interaction\n\nof planetesimals, the accretion of gas, the exchange of angular momentum via tidal forces and planet formation via\ngravitational instability. How these behaviours combine is\ndetermined by the initial conditions, for example the mass\nand temperature of the disc and the location of an embedded planet. We can sort all possible interactions into a few\ncategories: linear migration via tidal interaction, gap formation and viscous migration, and planet formation via gravitational instability. All these interactions have previously\nbeen investigated separately. Here we examine how the interactions are related and how the initial conditions determine which behaviour will be exhibited.\nThe dynamics of low-mass planets in gaseous discs have\nbeen explored both theoretically and numerically. The exchange of orbital angular momentum between disc and embedded satellite via spiral density waves excited at Lindblad resonances was discussed in Goldreich & Tremaine\n(1980). Ward (1997) gave arguments suggesting that this\nwill almost always lead to inward migration of the embedded planet, and derived an expression for the rate\nof this migration in the case where a planet does not\nopen a gap in the disc (Type I migration). More recently,\nTanaka, Takeuchi & Ward (2002) gave an updated formula\n\n\f2\n\nG. Lufkin et al.\n\nfor the total torque on a planet, taking into account corotation resonances and mentioning three-dimensional (3D)\neffects. Previous numerical simulations have tested some of\nthe theoretical assumptions, usually finding general agreement (e.g. Nelson et al. 2000; D'Angelo et al. 2002).\nIn Type II migration the planet exerts a tidal torque\ngreater than the disc viscous force, opening a gap. The\nmigration time-scale is slowed, and accretion on to the\nplanet is expected to slow or stop. Criteria for gap opening\nhave been derived (Takeuchi, Miyama & Lin 1996; Rafikov\n2002) and examined numerically using two-dimensional\n(2D) grids (Bryden et al. 1999; D'Angelo et al. 2002).\nThe accretion process has been simulated (Kley 1999;\nLubow, Seibert & Artymowicz 1999) finding mass-doubling\ntimes for Jupiter-mass planets in light discs to be of the order of 105 yr. For a review of Type I and II migration, see\nThommes & Lissauer (2002).\nThe standard picture of migration is situated in a calm,\nstable disc. What if a single planet forms in a marginally\nstable disc? First hinted at by Armitage & Hansen (1999),\nthe spiral density waves excited by a compact object (e.g. a\nrocky core formed via accretion of planetesimals) can lead to\nclump formation that would not otherwise occur. The fact\nthat an embedded planet affects the disc density and flow\nlocally has been known for some time; here we find that it\ncan also have far-reaching (spatially and temporally) global\neffects.\nRegardless of the embedded planets, some discs are\nthemselves gravitationally unstable. This scenario of planet\nformation has been explored by Boss (1997, 2001) and recently by Mayer et al. (2002). In unstable discs many planets of Jupiter-mass or greater can be formed very quickly\n(hundreds of years). The newly formed proto-giant planets\nwill violently tear through the disc, and their interaction as\npoint masses will dominate the subsequent evolution of the\nsystem. This scenario is attractive because it easily produces\nplanets with properties similar to observed extrasolar planets. Furthermore, because the time-scale of formation is so\nsmall, any system even marginally unstable is likely to form\nplanets during the much longer disc lifetime.\nMuch of the previous numerical work in this area has\nbeen limited to two-dimensional approximations, using grids\nwith a relatively small spatial range, and ignoring the selfgravity of the disc. Some three-dimensional simulations have\nbeen performed recently (Bate et al. 2003; D'Angelo et al.\n2003), although these have still ignored self-gravity. The\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formalism was designed to be spatially adaptive. Our implementation uses\nvariable time-steps, giving us temporal adaptivity. This allows us to explore the interaction with a much greater dynamic range. Our simulations are fully three-dimensional,\nhave free boundary conditions, include the self-gravity of\nthe disc and allow the planet to migrate and accrete freely.\nArmed with these useful tools, we have simulated planets embedded in gaseous discs, for initial planet masses\nranging from 10 Earth-masses to 2 Jupiter-masses, and disc\nmasses ranging from 0.01 to 0.25 M\u2299 . Previous investigations have focused on just one of the interactions described\nabove, usually looking at lower-mass discs. Here we attempt\nto relate the interactions, and see how the choice of initial\nconditions determines the classification of the outcome. We\ndraw an outline of interesting regions of parameter space,\n\nand present a few early results from each distinguishable\nregion. We also discuss where our simulations differ from\nprevious efforts and suggest that this is due to the more realistic system we are able to model. In future papers we will\nquantitatively address the specific phenomena we can simulate, such as gap opening criteria, gas accretion through the\ngap, Type I and II migration time-scales and the likelihood\nof triggered planet formation.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\ndescribe the initial conditions of our models. The numerical technique is briefly discussed in Section 3 and our main\nfindings are detailed in Section 4. Details of the results are\ndiscussed in Section 5 and we conclude with Section 6.\n\n2\n\nINITIAL CONDITIONS\n\nWe use power-law distributions for density and temperature profiles in our simulations, and the disc stability criterion and mass ratio are dimensionless, so our results should\nscale well. None the less, it is convenient to use conventional\nunits when discussing our results. The central star was of\n1 M\u2299 , and its potential was softened with a cubic spline\non a length-scale of 0.4 AU. All simulations were performed\nin heliocentric coordinates, taking into account the backreaction of the disc and planet on the star. Initially, the disc\nextends from 1 to 25 AU and is free to expand.\nTemperature profile\nObservations of protoplanetary discs do not put tight constraints on the temperature profile. Therefore, we adopt a\npower law for the radial temperature profile and choose\nan index which is equivalent to a constant aspect ratio\nH/r (where H is the scaleheight of the disc at a particular radius). Most of our simulations used H/r = 0.05\n(which gives T (5.2 AU)\n=\n102 K). This profile is\nsimilar to that suggested by the solar nebula model of\nHayashi, Nakazawa & Nakagawa (1985) and is common in\nother simulations of these phenomena. The temperature is\ncapped at 5000 K within 0.1 AU of the star and limited\nbelow by 17 K outside of 30 AU.\nDensity profile\nThe minimum-mass solar nebula model suggests a power law\nfor the vertically averaged surface density of \u03a3(r) \u221d r \u22123/2 .\nThe vertical structure of the disc is determined by the balance between the vertical component of the gravity of the\ncentral star and the vertical pressure support of the disc. If\nwe assume no vertical variation in the temperature, the vertical density structure can be solved, yielding a scaleheight\nexpressed as a function of the radius and the temperature\nat that radius. An expression for the density distribution is\nthen\n\u03c1(r, \u03b8, z) = \u03a3(r)\u03c1vert (r, z) = \u03a30 r \u22123/2\n\n\u0001\u0010\n\n\u03c10 e\u2212z\n\n2\n\n/H(r)2\n\n\u0011\n\nIn a gravitationally stable disc we found this profile to\nbe stable over many dynamical times, so we chose this\ninitial distribution for all of our simulations. Our standard disc, 0.1 M\u2299 extending from 1 to 25 AU, thus has\n\n\fSimulations of gaseous disc-embedded planet interaction\n\u03a3(5.2 AU) = 150 g cm\u22122 . For the gas particles of the\ndisc, the initial positions are randomly drawn from the desired distribution. Initial velocities are chosen so that particles are on circular Keplerian orbits, modified slightly to\naccount for the self-gravity of the disc and gas forces. In\nstable discs without embedded planets, the surface density\ndoes not change markedly with time except at the inner\nand outer edges. The outer edge expands slightly, due to\nthe initial sharp drop in density. At the inner edge, particles migrate inward due to viscous forces, participating in a\ncomplex balance between the softened potential of the star,\nthe smoothed gas pressure forces and Keplerian shear. These\nparticles are much closer to the central star than the inner\nLindblad resonance of the planet, so we do not believe they\nplay a large role in determining the evolution of the planet.\nWe have not investigated schemes for halting planet migration, which might involve removing the inner reaches of the\ndisc.\n\nbe several times more massive than the gas particles. Therefore, future investigations using higher resolution should be\nable to push the initial planet mass lower.\n2.2\n\nThe initial mass of the planet particle was a parameter. We\nused planet masses ranging from 10 M\u2295 to 2 MJ . The planet\nparticle interacts via gravity only, and no gas drag is applied. Planets significantly more massive than a gas particle\ncan capture gas particles, adding to the effective mass of\nthe planet. These captured gas particles are not removed or\ntreated specially; they remain as part of the envelope of the\ndeveloping planet. The potential of the planet was splinesoftened on a length-scale of one-fifth the initial Roche radius.\n\n2.1\n\nAn initial gap\n\nSufficiently large planets can open a gap in the disc by exerting a tidal torque stronger than the local viscous angular\nmomentum transfer. The balance between these forces determines the shape and width of the gap formed around such\na planet, which can be calculated analytically by averaging\nover many orbits and assuming how and where the density waves are dampened. The formation of these gaps has\nbeen studied numerically before, primarily in light discs with\nheavy planets without allowing migration (Bryden et al.\n1999), finding reasonable agreement with analytic models.\nFor low-mass discs, the Type I migration time-scale may\nbe sufficiently long for the standard explanation of gap formation to work. We found that planet migration and gap\nformation could not be decoupled. Therefore, we chose not\nto impose any initial gap, instead the formation of the gap\nis simulated in systems that produce one.\nA Jupiter-mass planet embedded in an unperturbed\ndisc without a gap is somewhat unphysical: how did the\nplanet become so massive without affecting the disc? As\nseen in Fig. 3 below, the transition from Type I to Type\nII migration is very sudden, taking only a few orbital times.\nTherefore, the sudden appearance of a large planet in a calm\ndisc is not entirely unreasonable, and we can imagine the following scenario: the planet forms, at a lower mass, further\nout in the disc, and undergoes Type I migration and accretion to obtain the location and mass we start with. To\naccurately model the capture of gas, the planet particle must\n\nEquation of state\n\nWe use an isothermal equation of state with a spatially fixed\ntemperature profile. In doing so we are assuming that the\ndisc temperature is controlled solely by the distance from\nthe parent star, and that the energy of viscous heating is\nradiated away much faster than the dynamical time-scale of\nthe gas. We do not account for shielding, so we miss the\ndetailed thermal structure of the clumps that form. Furthermore, clumps on elliptical orbits will heat up and cool\ndown along their orbits. Boss (2002) has found that using a\nmore realistic equation of state suppresses clump formation\nin marginally stable discs.\n2.3\n\nThe embedded planet\n\n3\n\nDisc stability\n\nThe stability of the disc is characterized by the Toomre Q\ncriterion, defined as\ncs \u03ba\nQ=\n\u03c0G\u03a3\nwhere cs is the sound speed, \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency, and\n\u03a3 is the surface density of the disc. This criterion measures\nthe susceptibility to a local instability. Global spiral waves\ncan cause the local density to increase, leading to a local\ncollapse. The power laws we have chosen for the temperature\nand density make Q \u221d r \u22121/2 . Hence we expect instabilities,\nif produced, to occur in the outer regions of the disc.\n\n3\n\nNUMERICAL REALIZATION\n\nTo model the disc\u2013planet system we used Gasoline, a\ntree-based particle code originally developed for cosmological simulations (Stadel 2001; Wadsley et al. 2004). It implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a Lagrangian\ntreatment of hydrodynamics for gas. It has been used previously on solar system-scale problems by Richardson et al.\n(2000) and Mayer et al. (2002). The code was modified to\napply a fixed temperature profile to the particles. The equations of motion include the gravity and hydrodynamics of\nthe gas disc. We do not include effects due to magnetic fields.\n3.1\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nSPH is a Lagrangian technique, so we do not need to impose\nany boundaries. All the particles are allowed to move where\nthe forces dictate. Particles are not deleted or merged when\nthey approach the central star or the embedded planet.\n3.2\n\nSimulation parameters\n\nThe tree\u2013cell interaction opening angle we used was\n\u03b8 = 0.7. Using a multi-stepping technique, the particle\ntimesteps are picked according to the local density (with\n\u03b7 = 0.1), and to satisfy the Courant condition (with\n\u03b7c = 0.4). The largest possible timestep was set to be\n2.5 yr, which is 1/50 the orbital time at the outer edge of\n\n\f4\n\nG. Lufkin et al.\n\nthe disc. The mean molecular weight of the gas is 2 AMU,\ncorresponding to molecular hydrogen.\n\n1.5\n1.25\n\nThe SPH formalism treats viscosity differently from the\nShakura & Sunyaev \u03b1 prescription popular in finite difference schemes. No 'real' viscosity is added to the equations\nof motion. Because so little is known concerning the sources\nof real viscosity, we choose to err on the side of caution by\nintroducing as little viscosity as possible into the system,\nin an attempt to model the fluid with as high a Reynolds\nnumber as possible. However, some artificial viscosity is necessary to stabilize the integration of the equations of motion.\nGasoline includes the standard Monaghan treatment of artificial viscosity (Monaghan 1992), including a Balsara switch\nthat reduces viscosity in regions of strong shear (Balsara\n1995). Using the SPH formulation of the equations of motion, we can estimate the kinematic viscosity \u03bd = \u1fb1 cs h / 8\n(Nelson et al. 1998) associated with the artificial viscosity.\nThis estimate is reasonable when there is little or no shocking (the presence of shocking adds artificial viscosity locally). There is strong shear in the disc, so the Balsara switch\nreduces this by a factor of approximately 5, yielding a vis4\ncous time-scale \u03c4 = r 2 / \u03bd >\n\u223c 10 yr everywhere for a run\n5\nwith 10 particles in a stable disc. Since this is at least 5\u201310\ntimes longer than our simulations, we believe that artificial\nviscosity will not seriously affect the dynamics of the disc.\nTo confirm this, we performed two additional simulations\nwhere we halved and doubled the standard value of \u1fb1 = 1.\nThe change in migration and accretion rates was approximately 5 per cent, which is less than the difference due to\nthe random seed used to determine the initial particle locations. This indicates that artificial viscosity only affects the\nsimulation as a numerical stabilizer, and does not introduce\nspurious physical effects.\n\n4\n\nType I\n\nViscosity\n\nRESULTS\n\nLooking first for planet migration, we start with planets embedded in light, stable discs. Increasing the disc and planet\nmasses increases the rate of Type I migration, and brings\nus to gap formation and Type II migration. Continuing to\nmarginally stable discs, we find that the density waves excited by an already formed planet can trigger gravitational\ninstability in discs that would otherwise remain stable. Finally, we push the disc mass high enough so that no external\ntrigger is needed to drive the gravitational collapse mode of\nplanet formation.\nSome of the factors that determine which category a system will end up in include the disc density profile and total\nmass, disc temperature, initial planet mass and orbital radius. We made choices for the density and temperature profiles, and varied the total disc mass, the initial planet mass\nand the orbital radius. We ran a simulation for each variation of the parameters for a given amount of time (326 yr),\nand classified the final result. We found the disc stability to\nbe the most influential factor in determining the behaviour\nof a disc\u2013planet system. The qualitative results of our suite\nof simulations can be seen in Fig. 1.

Mp is the mass of the planet, measured in Jupitermasses. The points show the parameter values for the simulations\nwe ran. See the discussion in the text. Since the totally unstable\ndiscs do not require planets, we cannot technically place them on\nthis plot. However, if the disc is unstable, an additional planet will\ncertainly not prevent instabilities from growing, so it is reasonable\nto label a region of this plot as unstable.\n\nresults in a map of parameter space, illustrating the relative\npositions of the four interactions.\nIn stable discs (the upper region), planets of all masses\nexhibit Type I migration. In more massive discs, planets can\nopen a gap, with a bias toward more massive planets. A precise measurement of the interface between these two regions\ncan show us the criteria for gap opening. To differentiate\nbetween the regions labelled 'Type I' and 'Gap Formation'\nwe look for the halting of the migration of the embedded\nplanet within the time we simulated. See Sec. 5.4 for our\ndefinition of a gap and the reasoning behind it.\nSome planets can trigger the formation of more planets via gravitational instability. This requires a marginally\nstable disc and a massive planet. The precise shape we have\ngiven this region is a guess based on our experience. In the\nbottom region, the disc is gravitationally unstable, even in\nthe absence of embedded planets.\nNote that the location of the boundaries between regions in this map are dependent on the time period of interest. We are deliberately simulating for only a few hundred years, to match the time-scale of triggered and wholly\nunstable planet formation. As such, many of the systems\nwe classify as Type I do satisfy the standard thermal and\nviscous criteria for gap formation, and would form deeper\ndepressions in the density profile and eventually shift from\nType I to Type II migration if we evolved them several times\nlonger. In addition, classification over such a short period of\ntime is important, as we measure very high migration and\naccretion rates.\n\n\fSimulations of gaseous disc-embedded planet interaction\n\n5\n\n0.018\n\nTable 1.

The top dashed line is\n2 MJ and the bottom dashed line is 0.5 MJ . The dotted line is\nfor a 1 MJ planet in the 2D approximation.\n\nWe have shown a two-dimensional slice through the\nthree-dimensional parameter space we explored. While convenient and, we believe, largely accurate, this does hide some\nof the complexity we found. For example, we looked for triggered instability by placing planets at different orbital radii\nin different mass discs such that the value of Q was the same\nat the location of each planet. Since Q is dimensionless and\nwe used power laws for the density and temperature, we\nmight expect the same result in each system. However, the\nsystem with closer planet and more massive disc did not\nfragment, while the further planet and less massive disc system did. This may be due to edge effects or a non-linear\ndependence on the effectiveness of Q as a predictor of collapse.\n\nas the simulation progresses and a gap is formed. We find\nthat the accretion rate scales linearly with the planet mass\nand disc surface density. Further, the migration rate scales\nlinearly with the disc surface density. However, changing\nthe planet mass has almost no effect on the migration\nrate, confirming the findings of Nelson & Benz (2003). If\nwe compare our results with the analytic expression (eq.\n70 from Tanaka et al. (2002)), we find our migration timescales (\u03c4M = a/|\u0227|) to be approximately 6 times shorter.\nMost previous simulations of Type I migration have kept\nthe planet on a fixed circular orbit, and estimated migration time-scales by measuring the torque on the planet from\nthe gaseous disc. Our migration timescales are actual measurements of the rate of change of the orbit of the planet.\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\nType I migration\n\nLinear theory suggests that a seed planet in a light gas disc\nwill undergo Type I migration with a rate that scales linearly\nwith the planet mass and disc surface density. The planet\nexcites density waves in the disc which torque back on the\nplanet, leading to a change in the orbital angular momentum of the planet. As a result of the power-law index we\nchose for the density profile, we always see inward migration. During Type I migration the planet accretes gas from\nthe disc with the help of the spiral density waves it excites.\nThe internal waves take angular momentum from the disc,\nand the external waves give angular momentum back to the\ndisc. On both sides, mass on nearby orbits is shepherded on\nto the planet.\nTable 1 lists migration and accretion rates for the systems we classified as Type I migration. For the lighter discs,\nthe migration rate is a constant function of time, whereas\na more massive disc causes the migration rate to decrease\n\nGap formation\n\nMore massive seed planets exert strong enough tidal torques\nto open a gap in the disc. By clearing the gas from the location of the Lindblad resonances, the torque exerted on the\nplanet by the disc vanishes. Previous theoretical work and\nsimulations have suggested that formation of a gap drastically reduces the accretion rate on to the planet. We have\nnot found this to be true. Even when the gap has cleared,\nthe planet still perturbs the disc. These perturbations act\nto pull mass off the edges of the gap and on to the planet.\nWe found that gap formation was dependent more on\nthe disc mass than the planet mass. This agrees with our\nclaim that the self-gravity of the disc is important. At the\nstart of the simulation the planet rapidly collects all the\ngas particles nearby, forming a gap within approximately\n100 years. This accretion of gas at corotation is much faster\nthan the accretion from close spiral arms or from gap edges,\nas described above. Since the migration time-scale is so short\n\n\f6\n\nG. Lufkin et al.\ntral star is more likely to trigger the collapse. If we place\na Jupiter-mass planet at 12.5 AU, a disc with Q >\n\u223c 1.6 will\nfragment (see Fig. 4). Once the instability is triggered, the\nevolution of the system is very similar to the totally unstable case. The clumps form with non-negligible eccentricity,\nand strongly disturb the disc profile.\n\n5.25\n\nPlanet Semi-Major Axis (AU)\n\n5\n4.75\n4.5\n\n4.4\n4.25\n4\n3.75\n3.5\n3.25\n3\n0\n\n35\n\n70\n\n105 140 175 210 245 280 315\nTime (yr)\n\nFigure 3.

The top dashed\nline is 2 MJ and the bottom dashed line is 0.5 MJ . The dotted\nline is for a 1 MJ planet in the 2D approximation.\n\nin the massive discs, there is significant migration during\nthe gap formation. After the gap has formed, the migration\nstops or slows considerably. In 0.1 M\u2299 discs, the accretion\nrate slows to a steady value of approximately 10\u22125 M\u2299 /yr,\nindependent of the mass of the planet. Fig. 2 shows the mass\nof a planet and its accreted envelope as a function of time,\nfor 0.5, 1, and 2 Jupiter-mass seed planets. By comparing\nwith Fig. 3, the semi-major axis of the planet as a function of time, we see the accretion slow as the planet clears\nits gap (changes from Type I to Type II migration). The\nplanet peels gas off the edges of the gap, as it catches up\nwith particles on the outer edge and is caught by particles\non the inner edge. Our results confirm that the formation of\n'Super-Jupiters' is possible in massive discs. As Type I migration ceases, the planet is left in the gap with a non-zero\neccentricity. We saw eccentricities of 0.01 to 0.04, comparable to the current eccentricity of Jupiter.\nThe time-scale for Type II migration is the viscous timescale of the disc. Since we are actively trying to reduce the\nviscosity of the disc in our simulation, we do not see significant migration after the gap has formed.\n\n4.3\n\nPlanet\u2013triggered instability\n\nIf we reduce the stability of the disc, the spiral arms generated by an embedded protoplanet can trigger the gravitational instability. Such triggered clumps are always exterior to the seed planet that drives the instability, because\nQ decreases with distance from the star. The spiral arms of\nthe planet must present a large enough density contrast to\ndrive the local value of Q below 1. Since the unperturbed\ndisc stability decreases with distance from the central star,\nfor a fixed disc stability, a planet farther out from the cen-\n\nUnstable discs\n\nIf the disc is massive and/or cool enough, gravitational instabilities will cause it to collapse into bound objects, regardless of any embedded planets. Spiral waves propagate, and\nthe density buildup in the arms causes the disc to fragment\ninto gravitationally bound objects. Not one, but several of\nthese bound objects are formed, and their interaction as\neffective point masses dominates the subsequent evolution.\nThe previously smooth disc is ripped apart, as the clumps\noften have sizable eccentricities (see Fig. 5 for a progression\nof snapshots). We observe collisions, ejections, tidal stripping during close encounters, and violent disruption when\nplunging too close to the parent star. The eccentricities of\nthese clumps can be high, and change as a result of dynamical interaction. As in Mayer et al. (2002), we find that the\ndisc is unstable when Toomre's Q criterion is less than approximately 1.4. The clumps form when a spiral arm with\nsufficient amplitude reaches the outer regions of the disc.\nFor this regime we present a simulation that was unstable, a 0.2 M\u2299 disc which has Qmin = 0.8. In this run, a spiral\narm at approximately 20 AU fragments into four separate\nclumps after 153 years. Five more clumps form over the next\n200 years. At this point, two clumps have developed strong\nleading arms, which fragment into approximately 10 more\nclumps over the next 30 years. Figs. 6 and 7 show the orbital\nand mass progression of some of the first clumps formed (the\nsimulation forms many more clumps than detailed in the\nplots). We see large eccentricities and eccentricity changes,\nand mergers of several clumps. Once a significant fraction\nof the gas has been caught up in clumps, we expect that\nthe furious production of new bound objects will cease, and\nthe system will evolve as a set of point masses. After a long\ntime (much longer than we have simulated) the system will\nreach dynamical stability, presumably with only a handful\nof objects remaining.\nWhen a spiral arm fragments, it collapses to a rotating\nspheroid. All our planets formed initially with prograde rotation, however a later merger resulted in a counter-rotating\nclump. We are not modeling the cooling of the atmosphere\nof the planet accurately, so cannot comment on what the\nfinal spin of the planets will be. Because our simulations are\nthree-dimensional, we can and do observe tilted planets, a\nresult of interactions with other planets and vertical asymmetry in the spiral density waves.\nOur work on wholly unstable discs extends the work\nof Mayer et al. (2002) to a larger region of parameter space,\nfollowing the system for a longer period of time and spatially\nfixing the temperature profile. The critical value of Q that\nheralds collapse is quite sensitive to the equation of state\nused (Boss 2002). A more detailed equation of state and\nmore physical treatment of radiative transfer are necessary\nto determine how likely planet formation via gravitational\ninstability is in a given disc. Note that, though we have\nevolved the system well past the initial collapse, we do not\n\n\fSimulations of gaseous disc-embedded planet interaction\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Triggered Planet Formation: A sequence of snapshots showing the gas density in a protoplanetary disc. At the planet's\nlocation Q = 2.2, at the outer edge Q = 1.6. Early, the planet drives spiral density waves in the outer regions of the disc. One of these\nwaves increases the local density to the point where the region collapses. The planet continues to drive the spiral arms, leading to further\nclump formation. The process will continue until the disc material is sufficiently depleted. The width of each image represents 55 AU.\n\nbelieve we have accurately modeled the detailed structure of\nthe planets that form because we are using a simple equation\nof state. However, we have accurately followed the gravitational interaction of the multiple planets that form. We can\ntherefore assert that, in planetary systems that formed via\ngravitational collapse, the disc torque theory of migration\ndoes not play a role, as the two-body interactions completely\ndominate the orbital evolution of the planets.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHere we describe how we calculated the mass of the planet,\nsome tests we performed, further discussion of our migration\nresults, and how we define and use the word 'gap' in this\nwork.\n\n5.1\n\nMass of the planet\n\nThe gas particles that are captured by the planet are not\nremoved from the simulation or added to the planet particle.\nThey continue to orbit in the disc along with the planet.\nWhen we give results for accretion rates we have to calculate\n\n\f8\n\nG.

The width of each image represents 55 AU.\n\na mass of the whole planet, including the initial point mass\nand the captured gas. We use a simple criterion to determine\nwhether or not a gas particle counts toward the mass of the\nplanet: a particle must be within the Hill sphere of the planet\nand have density greater than the Hill density (the planet\nmass divided by the volume of the Hill sphere). Since the Hill\nsphere depends on the planet mass, this process is iterated\nuntil the planet no longer grows, starting from the initial\nplanet particle.\n\n5.2\n\nResolution issues\n\nOur standard run for Type I migration is a 0.01 M\u2299 disc with\na Jupiter-mass planet starting on a circular orbit at 5.2 AU.\nWe simulate the system for 326 years (approximately 28 orbits) and calculate accretion and migration rates as a function of time. Over this time period the migration and accretion rates are constant, and the planet migrates inward\napproximately 0.3 AU and grows in mass to approximately\n1.8 MJ . We ran this model at several resolutions to check for\nconvergence. At resolutions of 20000 to 400000 particles the\naccretion rates matched to within 5 per cent and the migration rates to better than 1 per cent. Given this agreement,\nwe chose 105 particles as our standard resolution.\n\n\fSimulations of gaseous disc-embedded planet interaction\n\nconditions, and self-gravity is included. The density profiles\ncan be compared to the results of previous simulations, for\nexample fig. 3 of Nelson & Benz (2003) and fig. 10 of Kley\n(1999). Those simulations are both two-dimensional, treat\nviscosity differently, and apply boundary conditions at the\ninner and outer edges of the disc.\n\n32\n\nOrbital Radius (AU)\n\n28\n\n24\n\n5.3\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n250\n\n275\n\n300\n\n325\n\n350 375\nTime (yr)\n\n400\n\n425\n\n450\n\nFigure 6.

However they agree fairly well with a recent simulation of\nNelson & Benz (2003), which does include the self-gravity\nof the disc.\nWe believe our treatment of the vertical dimension and\nthe disc self-gravity is correct, and so the discrepancy should\nreveal invalid assumptions made in the linear theory of migration. Self-gravity always acts to increase the magnitude of\ndensity perturbations, so we would expect that the torques\narising from these perturbations would be correspondingly\nincreased, but we have not completed any simulations without self-gravity, so cannot comment further. To determine\nthe effect of including the vertical dimension of the disc, we\ndid several runs where all particles were constrained to the\nz = 0 plane. For light discs, the 2D case consistently gave accretion rates lower than the 3D case by at least 20 per cent.\nFor more massive discs, the 2D case appears to give a slightly\nhigher accretion rate during gap formation but again a lower\nrate after the gap has formed (see Fig. 2).

By what percentage must the density\ndecrease around a planet to be called a gap, and how far\nmust this density depression reach? These criteria necessarily invoke an arbitrary number. Fig. 8 shows an azimuthally\nand vertically averaged surface density of two simulations\nwith different disc masses. In both cases the gas density\nnear the planet has been markedly reduced, and these depressions could be called gaps. The planet in the heavier\ndisc has stopped migrating (see Fig. 3). In the lighter disc,\nhowever, the planet continues to migrate inward at a rate independent of the depth of the density depression. Therefore,\nwe choose to use the word 'gap' only when its dynamical effects are apparent, i.e. when the planet has stopped migrating. This is how we chose between the 'Type I' and 'Gap\nFormation' regions when classifying simulations for Fig. 1.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis work presents the first results from our ongoing investigation of planet formation and migration. It is a pioneering\napplication of global SPH simulations to a field previously\nexamined primarily with Eulerian grid-based simulations.\nUsing the new technique, we have measured migration and\naccretion time-scales, witnessing Type I migration and gap\nformation.

We have observed planet formation via disc fragmentation, including a cascade effect from a single starter planet.\nUsing massive discs, we find that it is easy to form large (tens\nof Jupiter masses) planets on a short time-scale (hundreds\nof years). If planets form via gravitational instability, the\ntheory of migration via disc torques is not applicable.\nTo obtain an overview of gaseous disc\u2013embedded planet\ninteractions, we performed a suite of simulations, varying the\nplanet mass, the initial location of the planet, and the disc\nstability. We have shown the orientation in parameter space\nof four broad categories of interaction. These interactions\nare: Type I migration; gap formation and Type II migration;\nplanet-triggered instability; and unstable discs. The stability\nof the disc is the most effective predictor of the type of\ninteraction between a gaseous disc and an embedded planet.\nPlanet formation and migration is a non-linear process\nthat requires the reasoned application of computational resources to model. Future investigations will explore the details of each interaction we have described. In addition, we\nwill refine our knowledge of the boundaries between regions\nof parameter space. Future observations will give us a range\nfor Q and a better understanding of the temperature profile in protoplanetary discs. Combined with the results presented here, we can say which migration and formation processes will be relevant.\n\nREFERENCES\nArmitage P. J., Hansen B. M. S., 1999, Nature, 402, 633\n\nBalsara D.
