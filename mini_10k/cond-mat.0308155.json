[Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 196803 (2003)], we have theoretically\ninvestigated the electronic properties of MIGS at interfaces between various alkali halides and a\nmetal represented by a jellium with the first-principles density functional method. We have found\nthat, on top of the usual evanescent state, MIGS generally have a long tail on halogen sites with a\npz -like character, whose penetration depth (\u03bb) is as large as half the lattice constant of bulk alkali\nhalides. This implies that \u03bb, while little dependent on the carrier density in the jellium, is dominated\nby the lattice constant (hence by energy gap) of the alkali halide, where \u03bbLiF < \u03bbLiCl < \u03bbLiI . We also\npropose a possibility of the MIGS working favorably for the exciton-mediated superconductivity.\nPACS numbers: 73.20.-r, 73.40.Ns, 71.15Mb\n\nMgO/Ag(001)11, the question of whether the observed\ngap states are formed by local chemical bonding remained, since MgO(222) is a polar surface so that a\nstrong hybridization between the O 2p band and the Ag\n5sp band is expected for MgO/Ag13 .\nRecently, Kiguchi et al12 have succeeded in observing\nMIGS at LiCl/Cu and LiCl/Ag interfaces. They have\ngrown a LiCl film on a metal substrate in a layer-by-layer\nfashion, and exploiting the near edge x-ray absorption\nfine structure (NEXAFS) which is an element-selective\nmethod, they have observed an extra peak below the\nbulk edge onset for LiCl film, which was interpreted as\nan evidence for MIGS. The reason why the detection\neluded earlier studies is that, in conventional methods\nsuch as ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy(UPS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy, or electron energy loss\nspectroscopy(EELS), the signal from the interface is obscured by significant contributions from the substrate.\nKiguchi et al. have estimated the decay length of MIGS,\nwhich are 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 for LiCl/Cu(001) and 2.9 \u00b1 0.7\n\u00c5 for LiCl/Ag(001), values much greater than those expected in simple models9 . An ab initio electronic structure calculation for LiCl/metal system has supported the\nexistence of the MIGS that is strongly localized at the\ninterface12 .\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study the\nelectronic structure of interfaces between various alkali\nhalides and a metal by means of first principles calculation, and to search for novel possibilities specific to\nmetal/insulator interfaces. We shall show that (i) MIGS\nhave a tail on halogen sites with a pz -like character,\nwhose penetration depth (\u03bb) is as large as half the lattice constant of the bulk alkali halide, which are totally\nconsistent with the experimental result12 , (ii) while \u03bb is\ninsensitive to the carrier density in the metal, the pene-\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nHeterointerfaces, namely solid-solid interfaces between\nvery dissimilar materials, have been an issue of great\ninterest in condensed matter physics, where various\nfascinating possibilities may be considered.\nEspecially, the electronic structure of metal/insulator or\nmetal/semiconductor interfaces has a long history of intensive studies dating back to the 1930's1,2.\nOne of the most crucial factors which govern the electronic structure of heterointerfaces is the metal-induced\ngap states (MIGS), whose eigenenergies lie in the band\ngap of the semiconductor (or insulator). While MIGS\nspread well into the metal side of the interface, they decay\nexponentially into the semiconductor. The decay length\nis an order of a few \u00c5 for typical semiconductors, where\nMIGS have been believed to determine the Schottky barrier height3\u20138 .\nIf we have an insulator/metal interface rather than\na semiconductor/metal interface, on the other hand, it\nhas generally been believed that the decay length of the\nMIGS into the insulator is negligible. This view has been\nbased on quite a plausible model calculation, where the\ninsulator/metal is represented by a simple tight-binding\nmodel/jellium9 . For a typical ionic insulator such as\nLiCl, the band gap (\u223c O(10) eV) is an order of magnitude greater than the transfer energy (\u223c O(1) eV) between the cations and anions, and the decay length is\nestimated to be smaller than 1 \u00c5, which would suggest\nthat MIGS should be irrelevant at insulator/metal interfaces.\nExperimentally, it is difficult to detect MIGS at the\nheterointerface between wide gap insulators and metal,\nbecause clean interfaces are difficult to be fabricated.\nWhile MIGS have been reported in MgO/Cu(222)10 or\n1\n\n\ftration depth is dominated by the energy gap of the alkali\nhalide. Specifically, the band gaps are ELiF > ELiCl >\nELiI , and the the penetration depth has the expected inequality, \u03bbLiF < \u03bbLiCl < \u03bbLiI .\nWe can consider various possibilities for many-body effects unique to heterointerfaces. There is in fact a long\nhistory for those, where the notable ones include metalinsulator transition14 and superconductivity15,16,18,17 . In\nthe context of the latter, here we propose that large density of states arising from the MIGS inside the insulator is\na good news for the superconductivity due to the exciton\nmechanism. The history of the exciton mechanism of superconductivity dates back to the proposals by Little15 ,\nGinzburg16,18 , and Bardeen et al17 . For this mechanism,\nthe coexistence, in real space, of dispersionless excitons\nand metallic carriers is required17 . While this is difficult\nto achieve in general, if the density of states due to MIGS\ninside the insulator is large enough, we may envisage that\nthe insulator/metal interface such as those discussed here\nmay provide a possible ground for superconductivity. We\nshall discuss this toward the end of the paper.\n\nII. METHOD\n\nThe electronic structure of MIGS is studied with a\nfirst-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. We adopt the exchange-correlation functional introduced by Perdew, Burke and Wang19 and\nultra-soft pseudo-potentials20,21 in a separable form. We\nhave first calculated the bulk system and determined the\nlattices. The obtained values (against experimental ones\nin parentheses) are 4.09 (4.02) \u00c5 for LiF, 5.13 (5.13) \u00c5\nfor LiCl, 5.95 (6.00) \u00c5 for LiI and 5.63 (5.63) \u00c5 for NaCl.\nWe have then introduced a slab model, where we put\na jellium in the middle of the unit cell sandwiched from\ntop and bottom by an alkali halide layer (Fig.1). Starting from this structure as an initial state, we have performed structure optimization. To confirm that the simplified model with the jellium capture main features in\nheterostructures with real metals, we have also studied\nthe system where five layers of Cu is considered in place\nof the jellium. The lattice mismatch between LiCl and\nCu happens to be small, so that we can take a small\nunit cell. The cut-off energy of the plane-wave expansion\nfor the wave functions are 20.25 Ry for LiF, LiCl and\nLiI/jellium, 25.00 Ry for NaCl/jellium, and 56.25 Ry for\nLiCl/Cu. The atomic configurations and the corresponding electronic states in the ground states are obtained\nwith the conjugate gradient scheme22 .\n\n(a) Front view\n\n(b) Front view\n\n(c) Top view\n(az)\n\n(az)\n8\n\n12\n\n6\n\nay\n\n10\n\ny\n4\n\n8\n\njellium\n2\n\nz\n\nax\n\nx\n\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n\njellium\n\nx\n\n2\n\n0\n\nz\n\n-2\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1.

In a(b) one (two)\nlayer(s) of alkali halide sandwich a metal region modeled by\na jellium, where solid (open) circles denote cation (anion)\natoms while shaded regions the jellium. Unit cells are indicated. The lattice\n\u221a constant along x, y directions is denoted\nas ax = ay = a/ 2, where a is the lattice constant defined\nfor the bulk alkali halide with NaCl structure. The interlayer\ndistance is denoted as az = a/2.\n\nPThe local 2 density of states is calculated as\ni |\u03c6i (x, y, z)| , where \u03c6i 's are eigenfunctions and\nthe summation is taken over a window EF < Ei <\nEF + 0.5eV with EF being the Fermi energy. We have\nset the window above EF to compare with the experiment, where the NEXAFS12 detects the unoccupied\nstates.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. LiCl\n\nLet us first discuss the case of LiCl/jellium.\nSince\nMIGS\nhave been\nobserved both\nin\nLiCl/Cu(commensurate) and LiCl/Ag(incommensurate)12 ,\nthe commensurability in the lattice constants across the\nheterointerface should not be essential for the formation\nof MIGS, as we shall confirm below from the results for\nLiCl/Cu and LiCl/jellium. So we start with the jellium\nmodel.\nWe show in Fig.2(a) the band structure of LiCl/jellium\nwhere LiCl layers, each one monolayer thick, sandwiches\nthe jellium that has rs = 2.5. We have also displayed the\nband structure for an isolated LiCl monolayer. From the\ncomparison we can see that the band structure of LiCl is\nnot severely affected by the presence of the jellium.\nIt is well-known that GGA or LDA generally underestimate the band gap, while GW approximation23,24 improves this. For instance, the band gap for bulk LiCl\nis 9.2 eV in GW, which is very close to the experimental value of 9.4 eV25 . However, the band-gap underestimation may be amended via the self-energy correction\n\n\fEnergy (eV)\n\nE\n\nF\n\nisolated\nLiCl\n\n0\n\n0\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-4\n-6\n\n-6\n\nG\n\nX\n\nM\n\nX\n\nG\n\nX\n\nM\n\nX\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\n0.003\n3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\nz(az)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nz(az)\n\n0\nx(ax)\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3. A plot similar to Fig.2, for a system where LiCl\ndouble layers sandwich the jellium having rs = 2.5.\n\nLiCl/jellium (rs=2.5)\n\n(a)\n\nIf we now replace the jellium with (five layers of) Cu\nin Fig.4, we can see that the LDOS for the LiCl/Cu has\na long tail just as in the result for the jellium model, so\nthat the characteristic feature of MIGS should not be an\nartifact of the jellium model.\n\n2\n2\n\nisolated\nLiCl\n\n0\nEnergy (eV)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nLDOS(EF)\n\nIn Fig.2(b,c) we have plotted the local density of states\n(LDOS) integrated along x or y-directions. We can see\nthat LDOS has a significant (\u223c lattice constant) tail with\na pz character on the halogen site in addition to a usual\nevanescent-wave like part that exponentially decays away\nfrom the interface. In the experiment12 , while there is no\ninformation on Li sites since the element-selective NEXAFS was tuned for Cl in that experiment, an unoccupied state on Cl sites is observed near EF .

A plot similar to Fig.2, when the jellium is replaced\nwith five layers of Cu.\n\nTo confirm that the penetration depth of the tail of\nMIGS is as large as a few \u00c5, we have also calculated a\nlarger system, where LiCl double layers sandwich the jellium. From the band structure and the LDOS in Fig.3 we\ncan see that the MIGS do not penetrate into the second\nlayer of LiCl.\n\nWhy MIGS have amplitudes only on Li sites can be\nexplained as follows. In general, MIGS can be divided\ninto two groups: one having a conduction-band character and the other having a valence-band character in the\ninsulator side of the interface. Noguera et al9 have introduced the energy EZCP , above which MIGS have a\nvalence-band character. While the charge neutrality in\nthe insulator side is satisfied when EZCP is equal to EF ,\ncharge transfer from the insulator to the metal occurs\nif EZCP > EF . In Fig.5, we plot the difference in the\n\n\fvalence-charge density \u03b4\u03c1 between the LiCl+jellium and\nthe isolated LiCl. We can see that, while \u03b4\u03c1 is positive\nfor most of the insulator region (0 < z < 2), it is negative\naround the Cl site. Thus EZCP should be higher than EF\nin this system, and MIGS should have a tail on the anion\nsites.\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n3\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n0.005\n\nDr\n\n0\n\nDr\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(a) LiF/jellium(rs=2.5)\n\n1\n\nz(az)\n\n2\n2\n\n0\nx(ax)\n\n1\n\n0\n\nisolated\nLiF\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nz(az)\n\nFIG. 5.

Namely, MIGS have a long tail on anion\nsites with a penetration depth \u03bb as large as the layer\nspacing az = a/2. The lattice constants are a = 4.09 \u00c5\nfor LiF, 5.13 \u00c5 (LiCl), 5.95 \u00c5 (LiI) and 5.63 \u00c5 (NaCl),\nand \u03bb for LiI is indeed the largest (1.5 times as large\nas that for LiF). Note that anions with higher electron\naffinity have smaller ionic radii in general, so that alkali\nhalides with largeer band gap have smaller lattice constants.\n\n0\nEF\n\n-2\n\n-2\n-4\n-4\n-6\n-6\n\nG\n\nX\n\nM\n\nG\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nM\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nLDOS(EF)\n\nLet us move on to the rs dependence.

A plot similar to Fig.2 with LiCl replaced by NaCl.\n\nIV. POSSIBILITY OF EXCITON MEDIATED\nPAIRING\n\nOne of the most fascinating possibilities which should\nbe explored for heterointerfaces is, we believe, the\nexciton-mediated superconductivity. The exciton mechanism has been originally proposed by Little15 for metallic, quasi-one dimensional spines of conducting electrons\nto which dielectric organic molecules are conceived to be\nattached chemically. Subsequently, two-dimensional version of this mechanism has been proposed16\u201318 , where a\nmetallic film covered by a dielectric coating was considered.\nTo realize the exciton mechanism in general, carriers\nhave to coexist and strongly interact with the excitons.\nThus the penetration length must be sufficiently large,\nwhich is why it has been believed that the band gap of the\ncoating material should not be too large. On the other\nhand, Inkson and Anderson26 have pointed out that, if we\nadopt the model dielectric function for typical semiconductors, exciton-electron coupling becomes small, partially because the exciton has a large energy dispersion\nso that the phase space over which the mechanism works\nfor the formation of paring is restricted. In fact, in Ref.17\nthe energy dispersion of the exciton is ignored. In other\nwords, they have considered a Frenkel exciton, which is\nusually unrealistic for (narrow gap) semiconductors.\nNow, the present result for MIGS at metal/insulator\ninterfaces can reconcile the very dilemma. Namely, while\na conventional wisdom tells that the penetration depth\nshould be extremely small for metal/wide-gap insulator\ninterfaces, the present result suggests that the depth is\nof the order of the lattice constant for the MIGS, so that\na substantial portion of the carriers can interact with the\nexciton in the insulator side. Thus it becomes an intriguing problem to estimate the electron-exciton coupling for\n\n\u03b5(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212\n\n(\u03b5optical \u2212 1)\u03c902\n,\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c902\n\nwhere \u03c90 \u223c \u03c9g is the typical exciton energy, and\n\u03b5optical the optical dielectric constant, then \u03bbex becomes\ns\u03b3 2 (D/L)\u03bc(\u03b5optical \u2212 1).\nLet us first look into the factor \u03b3D/L. This factor is,\nin the simplified model due to Bardeen, the fraction of\nthe time over which the metal electrons spend in the insulator. In the more realistic model we have at hand, we\ncan more precisely integrate the LDOS in the insulator\nregion (\u2261 \u03c1i , shaded region in Fig.2(c) etc) since MIGS\ndo not possess a monotonic (exponential) LDOS, and we\ncan then divide the quantity by that for the metal region (\u2261 \u03c1m ) to obtain the factor corresponding to \u03b3D/L.\nNamely, the factor should read b \u2261 2\u03c1i /\u03c1m , in place of\n\u03b3D/L, where az = a/2 (see Fig.1). The present model\nis a sandwich structure where the metallic layer is covered by the dielectric coatings from both sides, so that\nthe factor 2 appears in r.h.s. Here we set that the thickness of metallic layer to be 10 \u00c5. The resulting values are\nb = 0.08 (for LiF), 0.18(LiCl), 0.16(LiI), and 0.12(NaCl).\nOn the other hand, (\u03b5optical \u2212 1) are 0.92, 1.68, 2.4 and\n1.33 for LiF, LiCl, LiI and NaCl, respectively27 . Therefore, if we adopt the same values for s(= 1/2), \u03bc(= 1/3),\n\u03b3(= 1/2) as in Ref.17 , \u03bbex can become as large as 0.06\nfor LiI, while we have \u03bbex = 0.01(LiF), 0.05( LiCl), and\n0.03(NaCl).\nIf we adopt weak-coupling conventional superconductors, e.g. Al, as the metal, the superconducting transition\ntemperature can be roughly estimated18,28 as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nTc = \u03b8 exp \u2212\n,\n(\u03bbph + \u03bbex \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 )\nwhere \u03bbph is the electron-phonon coupling, \u03bbex the\nelectron-exciton coupling, and \u03bc\u2217 the renormalized \u03bc. So\n\u03b8 is roughly expressed as\nZ\nd\u03c9\n,\nlog \u03b8 \u221d (log \u03c9) [\u03c1ex (\u03c9) + \u03c1ph (\u03c9)]\n\u03c9\nwhere \u03c1ph (\u03c1ex ) is the density of phonon (exciton) states.\nIn general, \u03c1ph has a peak in a low energy region, so\nthat, when phonons and excitons coexist, the contribution of the phonon part to \u03b8 should be dominant than\n\n\fthat of the exciton part. Thus \u03b8 basically scales with\nthat of phonon, but the exciton contribution on top of\nthat can enhance the Tc significantly. For example, when\n\u03bbph \u2243 0.4, \u03bc\u2217 \u2243 0.05, and \u03bbex \u2243 0.1, Tc becomes 1.6\ntimes greater than that in the bulk. Thus we conclude\nthat heterointerface between metal and LiI or LiCl can be\na promising ground for detecting the existence of excitonenhanced superconductivity.\nIn addition, the proximity of different systems enables\nus to expect entirely different mechanism. Namely, two\nof the present authors29 have earlier proposed that a class\nof repulsively interacting systems that consist of a carrier\nband and an insulating band can become superconducting, where the system can effectively mapped to an attractive Hubbard model. The point is, while the conventional boson-exchange pairing arises due to a retarded attraction, superconductivity in the carrier-insulator model\noccurs due to a nonretarded attraction. In their model,\nthe metallic band is assumed to interact only with the\nanion sites (or to interact only with the cation sites).\nAt the interface between an alkali halide and a metal,\nMIGS have their amplitudes on anion sites, so that the\nMIGS should interact primarily with anion sites, which\njust corresponds to the situation considered in Ref.29 .\nThe detailed study on the combined effect of the nonretarded attraction (which decreases \u03bc\u2217 ) and the exciton\neffect (which increases \u03bbj is an interesting future problem.\n\nV. SUMMARY\n\nWe have studied the electronic properties of metalinduced gap states(MIGS) at interfaces between various\nalkali halides and a metal. We have performed firstprinciples density functional calculation to show that (i)\nin addition to a usual evanescent-wave component, MIGS\nhave a tail on halogen sites with pz -like character, whose\npenetration depth is as large as the lattice constant of\nthe alkali halide, (ii) while \u03bb does not significantly depend on the carrier density of jellium, it depends on the\nenergy gap of alkali halides, with \u03bbLiF < \u03bbLiCl < \u03bbLiI .\nWe have estimated the electron-exciton coupling, and\nhave found that we may envisage that insulator/metal\ninterfaces such as those discussed in the present study\nmay provide a possible ground for exciton-mediated superconductivity.\n\nVI.
