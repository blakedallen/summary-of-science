Box 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary\n\nWe report experimental observations of sound waves in a granular material during resonant silo\ndischarge called silo music. The grain motion was tracked by high speed imaging while the resonance\nof the silo was detected by accelerometers and acoustic methods. The grains do not oscillate in phase\nat neighboring vertical locations, but information propagates upward in this system in the form of\nsound waves. We show that the wave velocity is not constant throughout the silo, but considerably\nincreases towards the lower end of the system, suggesting increased pressure in this region, where\nthe flow changes from cylindrical to converging flow. In the upper part of the silo the wave velocity\nmatches the sound velocity measured in the same material when standing (in the absence of flow).\nGrain oscillations show a stick-slip character only in the upper part of the silo.\n\nWhen a granular material is slowly discharged from a\nvertically aligned container (tube) one often observes vibrations accompanied by a booming low frequency (typically 50 \u2212 200 Hz) sound. This phenomenon can be observed in large silos and is often referred to as silo music\nor silo honking, but it can also easily be reproduced in\nsmaller scale laboratory experiments [1\u20138]. Silo quaking\ncan also be observed during discharge [9, 10] where short\nsharp bursts of motion are separated by longer periods\nof no movement.\nAlthough resonances during silo discharge are long\nknown in industry and have recently been investigated\nthoroughly [1\u20134], the phenomenon is not yet fully understood. While one explanation is based on stick-slip motion of the grains near the silo walls [4\u20136], other authors\nargue that the phenomenon originates from a dynamic\ninteraction between the silo structure and the flowing\nmaterial, where the source of the vibration is the transition zone between cylindrical and converging flow in the\nlower part of the system near the outlet [1\u20133]. Recent laboratory experiments carefully investigated the frequency\nspectrum of the vibrations by piezoelectric accelerometers and microphones [1\u20135] and related these observations\nof the calculated eigenfrequencies of the silo structure [3]\nand the time evolution of the density of the material detected by a non-invasive method (Electrical Capacitance\nTomography) [1, 2]. Optical imaging of silo quaking was\nreported in [11] using a frame rate of 8.3 fps. Here the\npredominant frequency of the bursts was about 1 Hz,\nwhich was significantly lower (by a factor of 2 or 4) than\nthe frequency of the silo wall vibrations indicating no resonance in this case. Moreover, grain oscillations were in\nphase over the largest part of the silo wall, so grain motion could not be linked to wave propagation. This contradicts other measurements on silo quaking [9, 10] where\nthe quake propagated upwards in the silo with a well defined velocity and growing amplitude, as detected by accelerometers embedded into the granular material. Very\nrecent observations [12] on resonant pipe flow (the pipe\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: btamas@szfki.hu\n\nis continously fed from above) detected upward propagating waves using piezoelectric sensors, and claim constant wave speed in the entire tube, meaning, that the\ntransition zone near the outlet has no special role in the\nformation of the resonance. This contradicts other measurements [3], where manipulating the geometry of the\ntransition zone allows for very effective reduction of the\nresonance.\nIn this Brief Report we present direct observations of\nthe grain motion during resonant silo discharge by means\nof high speed imaging using a frame rate of 3000 fps.\nThis non-invasive technique allows us to better characterize the spatial evolution of the system. The aim of this\nstudy is to measure whether the grain oscillations show\na stick-slip character near the walls, and if so, in which\npart of the silo? Are there regions in the silo, where the\ngrains oscillate coherently in neighboring vertical positions, or not? What is the speed of wave propagation in\nthe granular material during resonance?\nIn the present experiments the silo flow was realized in\na vertically aligned glass tube of length 150 cm (see Fig.\n1(a)). Two tubes were used with the inner diameters of\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Schematic illustration of the experimental setup and (b)-(c) microscopic images of the materials\nused: (b) glass beads with mean diameter of d = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05\nmm, (c) copper particles with d = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 mm.\n\n\f2\nD = 3.55 cm and 2.3 cm. We present results for two materials (i) nearly spherical copper particles with average\ngrain diameter of d = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 mm and (ii) spherical\nglass beads with d = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 mm (see Figs. 1(b)-(c)).\nQualitatively similar results were obtained with quartz\nsand, granite and corundum of similar sizes, but in those\ncases the resonance was less pronounced. For the detection of the grain motion we used high speed cameras\n(Mikrotron CAMMC1310 and 1362) with a frame rate of\n3000 fps. The resonance was also detected by traditional\nmethods: piezoelectric accelerometers mounted on the\nglass tube (for horizontal vibration), on the support of\nthe tube (for vertical vibration), and a condenser microphone with large diaphragm (IMG Stageline ECM-140).\nThe silo discharge speed was varied by changing the diameter of the outlet Dout at the bottom of the tube. As\nthe main features of the phenomenon we are focusing on\ndo not depend on the precise value of Dout , for convenience a constant value Dout = 8 mm was chosen for this\nstudy.\nFirst we present the general features of the resonance\nobtained by piezoelectric accelerometers and the microphone. In one experiment the above signals have been\nrecorded during the initially full hopper discharges.

The\ndashed line corresponds to the frequency of the standing wave\n(first harmonic) in the air column above the material.\n\ntakes about 80 s and 120 s for the tube with D = 2.3 cm\nand D = 3.55 cm, respectively. The power spectrum of\nthese signals has been calculated using discrete Fourier\n\ntransform (DFT) with measurement windows of 0.5 s and\nis shown as a function of time in Figs. 2(a) and (b). As\nit is seen in Fig. 2(a) at the beginning of the process the\nsystem vibrates with a fundamental frequency of about\n60 Hz, and this frequency slightly increases as the silo\ndischarges. At t = 44 s there is a quick transition characterized by a jump in the dominant frequency, but the\ntrend of a slowly increasing frequency of the dominant\nmode persists until the resonance disappears at about\nt = 78 s. This picture is fully coherent with other observations [1\u20133] and can be explained as follows. The\ngranular flow excites the eigenmodes of mechanical vibration of the tube itself and the frequency of these modes\nis slightly increasing in time as the material is flowing\nout of the system and the weight of the oscillating body\ndecreases. The time evolution of the system allows for\nchanging the actually excited eigenmode, for which we\nhave an example at t = 44 s where we see a jump in the\ndominant resonant frequency.\nThe signal picked up by the microphone shows the\nsame characteristics as that of the accelerometer, but in\naddition to the eigenmode with slightly increasing frequency we find a resonance with decreasing frequency.\nThis is the sign of standing sound waves in the air column in the tube above the granular material. As the\nlength l of this column is increasing with time (as the\nsilo discharges) the frequency of the dominant mode is\ndecreasing. The amplitude of this signal gets strong\nwhen it resonates with the \"driving\" frequency. The\ndashed line corresponds to the frequency of the standing wave (first harmonic) according to the formula of\nc\nc\nc\nf (t) = \u03bb(t)\n= 4l(t)\n= 14 * vs t+0.3D\nwhere vs is the velocity\nby which the top surface of the granular bed is sinking,\nc is the velocity of sound in air and 0.3D is the length\ncorrection for the open end of the tube [13]. The value\nof vs has been measured in an additional experiment,\nwhere the whole process was recorded optically and the\nposition of the top surface was determined by digital image analysis. Several measurements confirmed, that vs is\nnearly independent of time except near the very end of\nthe process where vs slightly increased.\nIn the following we will focus on the data obtained\nwith high speed imaging. First we show how the grains\nmove at a selected height x. For this we took images of a\nvertical stripe of 1 \u00d7 0.1 cm and determined the displacement of the particles by correlating subsequent images.\nThis procedure was repeated at various heights. In Fig.\n3 three examples are shown, where Fig. 3(a) shows the\nposition s of the particles as a function of time, while (b)\nand (c) show the corresponding velocity v and acceleration a. The three measurements correspond to x = 12\ncm, x = 67 cm and x = 127 cm measured from the bottom of the tube. As it is seen, the grains move downwards\nwith oscillating velocity. At the top and middle of the\ntube during each period they come to a full stop, remain\nstanding for a considerable portion of the period and then\naccelerate downwards.

Data taken with copper particles\nin the tube with the diameter of D = 3.55 cm.\n\ncome to a full stop and their acceleration does not come\nclose to g. The average grain velocity near the walls vav\n(i.e. the slope of the curves in Fig. 3(a)) is smaller than\nthe velocity vs by which the top surface of the granular bed is sinking. The corresponding three values are\nvav /vs = 0.54, 0.59 and 0.89 for x = 12 cm, 67 cm and\n127 cm, respectively. This means that no perfect plug\nflow develops, i.e. the grains move slower near the walls\nthan in the center of the tube even at the uppermost part\nof the material.\nIn order to measure whether or not the grains at different heights oscillate in phase with each other, a longer\nvertical stripe of 13.2 \u00d7 0.5 cm was monitored. Two 2.2\ncm long segments were analyzed at the upper and lower\nparts of this image. As it is seen in Figs. 4(a)-(b) there is\na phase shift between these signals (indicated by vertical\nlines) implying that the grains in neighboring segments\ndo not oscillate in phase with each other, but waves are\npropagating upwards in the system. The phase shift between the neighboring peaks in Fig. 4(a) corresponds to\na wave velocity of U = 54 m/s, while in the lower part of\nthe tube (Fig. 4(b)) a larger wave velocity (smaller phase\nshift) is observed. The velocity U of the upward propagating waves has been measured at 6 different vertical\npositions. The resulting U (x) curves are shown in figs.\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Grain velocity v as a function of time\nat two nearby locations at (a) x = 102 cm (\u22c6) and x = 113\ncm (\u25e6) and (b) x = 22 cm (\u22c6) and x = 33 cm (\u25e6). The\ntime lag between the curves is a measure of the corresponding\nsound velocity. (c)-(d) Velocity of sound waves as a function\nof location x in the tube with (c) D = 2.3 cm and (d) D = 3.55\ncm. The curves correspond to different stages of the process,\nwhen the top of the material was at x = 145 cm (\u25e6), x = 110\ncm (\u2207), x = 77 cm (\u22c4) and x = 47 cm (\u25b3). Data for copper\nwith open symbols, data for glass beads with solid symbols.\n\n4(c) and (d) for the two tubes with D = 2.3 cm and 3.55\ncm, respectively. This measurement has been repeated\nat four different stages of the process, where the top of\nthe material was at x = 145 cm, x = 110 cm, x = 77\ncm and x = 47 cm. The wave velocity U appears to be\nconstant in the upper part of the tube. In the smaller\ntube (D = 2.3 cm) we get U = 44 \u00b1 6 m/s for glass beads\nand U = 54 \u00b1 6 m/s for the copper particles, while in\nthe larger tube (D = 3.55 cm) U = 65 \u00b1 6 m/s for both\nmaterials. These values are similar to those previously\nobserved for the velocity of upward propagating pulses\ndetected during \"silo quaking\" [9]. There single rarefaction waves (quakes) propagated upwards in the system\nwith a velocity of 74 \u00b1 15 m/s and 135 \u00b1 20 m/s in the\ntwo Perspex tubes with the diameters of 9 cm and 30 cm\nrespectively. The fact that we find larger value of U in\nthe larger tube also agrees with the above data obtained\nfor quakes and is in accordance with very recent observations on continous pipe flow, where the velocity of sound\nwaves was demonstrated to increase with increasing tube\ndiameter [12]. Our more detailed spatial characterization\nhowever revealed (Figs. 4(c)-(d)), that the wave velocity is not constant throughout the tube but it increases\n\n\f4\ntowards the bottom of the tube. The larger value of U\nmeasured at the lower part of the tube means a smaller\nphase lag between the oscillation of neighboring particles,\nwhich, in accordance with other results [1, 3], shows that\nthe resonance originates from that part of the tube where\nthe flow changes from cylindrical to converging flow (at\nx \u2248 4D) leading to strong density oscillations.\nAn additional experiment was done to measure the velocity of sound waves in the standing material (without\nflow) using the smaller tube (D = 2.3 cm). In this measurement we placed 2 piezoelectric accelerometers in the\ngranular material at a distance dx above each other, and\nperturbed the granular bed at the lower end of the tube\nwith a pneumatically generated single pulse.

The slope of the resulting curves (presented in Fig.\n5) gives for the speed of sound waves in the standing material Us = 53 \u00b1 5 m/s for glass beads and Us = 48 \u00b1 5\nm/s for the copper particles. These values agree nicely\nwith the ones discussed above observed in the same tube\nduring flow (resonance) and are similar to other experimentally obtained values for the sound speed in glass\nbeads (60 \u2212 240 m/s [14]; 40 \u2212 60 m/s [16]) or sand (40\nm/s [15]), or even using much softer photoelastic particles (100 m/s [17]).

More importantly, recent\ninvestigations uncovered, that in samples under external uniaxial load, the velocity of compressional waves is\nsensitive to stress induced anisotropy, leading to larger\nU perpendicular to the applied load than parallel to it\n[19]. Also, U increases more gradually with pressure P\n(U \u221d P 1/4 ) at lower pressures, compared to the generally\nobserved U \u221d P 1/6 dependence at higher P [18]. Both of\nthese observations [18, 19] indicate, that the larger wave\nvelocity measured during resonant flow in the lower part\nof the tube suggests increased radial pressure in this region, where the velocity gradient changes due to the proximity of the outlet.\nIn summary, we studied a resonance phenomenon\ncalled \"silo music\" during silo discharge. We have visualized the oscillations in grain motion with high speed\nimaging, and detected that grain oscillations are not coherent when compared at different heights, but there is a\nphase lag. Information propagated upward in the system\nin the form of sound waves. One of our major findings\nis, that the wave velocity is not constant throughout the\nsilo, but considerably increases towards the lower end of\nthe system (corresponding to a more coherent motion of\nthe grains). This underlines the importance of the transition zone in the lower end of the silo, where the flow\nchanges from cylindrical to converging flow and is in accordance with those observations [1, 3] which suggest that\nthe source of the resonance phenomenon is the generation\nof strong stress oscillations in this region. As shown, the\namplitude of the grain oscillations increases with height\nand leads to stick-slip motion in the upper part of the\nsilo. This supports the argument that appropriate friction with the walls is crucial for the amplification of the\nwaves [9, 12, 20, 21] and could be a necessity for strong\nresonance as argued by other authors [4\u20136], which is also\nsupported by the fact that increasing the roughness of\nthe silo walls (i.e. suppressing stick-slip) effectively reduces the resonance [7, 8]. Finally, we have also shown\nthat the velocity of the waves in the upper part of the\nsilo matches the sound velocity measured in the same\nmaterial when standing (in the absence of flow).\nThe authors are thankful for discussions with Kesava\nRao, who motivated us to study this problem.
