polarons (precursors or full blown) and their role in the universe:\nan enigma to be possibly solved by LHC\nAuthor: Mladen Georgiev (Institute of Solid State Physics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences\n1784 Sofia, Bulgaria)\nComments: 8 pages incorporating wording and 6 figures, all pdf format\nSubj-class: physics\n\nVibronic polarons (charge carriers coupled to their produced Jahn-Teller distortions) have\nbeen extended for some time in relevance to the buildup of matter and the breakdown of\nsupersymmetry at the early stages of universe, as well as to a number of well established\nthough not fully understood phenomena of everyday life, such as helical propagation,\nchirality, colossal magnetoresistance, etc. We review some of the previous advances and\nsuggest new ones. Many of our predictions can be checked by LHC experiments.\n\n1. The vibronic polaron\nVibronic polarons (vp) have been introduced for the first time by Thomas et al. back in the\nearly 1980s in a variational ansatz study [1]. However, they chose a controversial coupling\nHamiltonian which reduced their species to Holstein polarons. The problem was tackled later\nby Brown et al. in 1999 hopefully on a more convincing basis [2]. While Thomas et al.\nconsidered a local deformation of the Jahn-Teller (JT) type, later developments have extended\nthe species by introducing a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (pJT) coupling to obtain a polaron.\nAccordingly, we now define the vp as a charge carrier coupled to its produced pJT distortion.\nAs we shall see shortly, the pJT extension brings about a number of novel features to vp.\nThe vp Hamiltonian can be defined similar to the band (co-operative) JT effect [3]. Likewise,\nwe introduce electron and phonon ladder operators, as well as coupling constants and local\nenergy terms. This defines our problem within the electron-phonon framework. (Details can\nbe found elsewhere [4].) In so doing we see that similar logistics can be applied to many\ncoupled fermion-boson systems, not only electron-phonon ones. We now extend the vp\ndefinition accordingly, as follows:\nWe consider an extended global Hamiltonian introducing ladder operators in 2nd quantization,\nan\u03b1s and an\u03b2s\u2020, etc. for fermions, bns and bns\u2020 for bosons. Their mixing Hamiltonian reads\nHmix = \u2211n\u03b1\u03b2s gn\u03b1\u03b2s (bns\u2020 + bns) (an\u03b1s\u2020 an\u03b2s + an\u03b2s\u2020 an\u03b1s)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere gn\u03b1\u03b2s = Gn\u03b1\u03b2(Mn\u03b1\u03b2s\u03c9n\u03b1\u03b2s2/h\u03bdn\u03b1\u03b2s)-1\u20442 is the mixing constant, Mn\u03b1\u03b2s the reduced mass and\n\u03bdn\u03b1\u03b2s the vibrational frequency of the coupled oscillator, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two fermion orbital\nbands, nearly-degenerate and of opposite parities, s is the spin variable, n is the site index.\nan\u03b1s\u2020 and bns\u2020, etc. are superpartners. To obtain the complete global Hamiltonian, we add up\nthe diagonal energy terms, fermion and boson, respectively:\n\n\fHf + Hb = \u2211n\u03b1\u03b2s En\u03b1s an\u03b1s\u2020an\u03b1s + \u2211n\u03b1\u03b2s (n + 1\u20442)h\u03bdn\u03b1s bns\u2020 bns\n\n(2)\n\nas well as the fermion hopping (band) term\nHfhop = \u2211n\u03b1s tn\u03b1s an\u03b1s\u2020 (an-1\u03b1s + an+1\u03b1s)\n\n(3)\n\nThe complete global Hamiltonian then reads\nH = Hf + Hb + Hfhop + Hmix\n\n(4)\n\nFigure 1: Local adiabatic energies of planar vibronic polarons to first order (a) and third order\n(b) of the electron-vibrational mode coupling constant. While the off-centered circle is clearly\nidentifiable in (a), rotational barriers along the off-center ring are also seen adding up to (b).\n\nFigure 2: Conceived oblate (left) and prolate (right) off-center oxygen volumes due to\nappropriate mode coupling in high-Tc superconductors. Vertical is the c-axis of the crystal.\n\n\fBecause of the large asymmetry of masses in favor of the phonon, eigenvalues of (1) can be\nfound approximately by means of the adiabatic approximation [5] which gives potential\nenergies for vp rotation. One such is shown in Figure 1 for two coupling situations.\n2. Off-center volume and deformed nuclei\nDue to tunneling across the off-center to on-center barrier, the atomic particle which\nrepresents the distortion around a small vp polaron appears smeared within the off-center\nvolume [6]. Depending on the symmetry of the coupled boson the latter volume may be oblate\nor prolate. In nuclear matter such may be the physics behind the deformed nuclei [7]. The\nasymmetric form of the deformed nuclei (boson coupling) or the smeared off-center ions\n(phonon coupling) is the most direct appearance of the shape of the off-centered species. For\nthis reason, its experimental observation is a primary object of the vp study. Examples of\nconceived oblate and prolate forms of off-center volumes are shown in Figure 2.\n3. Electrostatic vp polarizability\nThe vp has an associated off-center displacement of the center of charge which creates an\nelectric dipole inherent for the polaron. It has also associated dipoles arising from the mixing\nof electronic states by the phonon coupling in accordance with the coupling Hamiltonian (1).\nThe two kinds of dipoles are clearly interrelated. However, due to flip-flops across the centrosymmetric site the average electric dipole is vanishing because each flip-flop reverses to the\nopposite the sign of the dipole without altering its magnitude. As a result, vp is polarizable\nelectrostatically like a polarizable atom. An immediate consequences of vp polarizability is,\nlikewise, the occurrence of dispersive pair interactions between the species.\nNow if \u03b1 is the vp polarizability then the Van der Waals (VdW) pair interaction however\ncomplex it has been simplified to the form [8] 1\u20442 h\u03bdrot(\u03b1 /\u03baR3)2 where \u03bdrot is the flip-flop\nfrequency, R is the pair separation, \u03ba is an appropriate dielectric constant. The polarizability is\nrelated to the electrostatic dipole by way of \u03b1 = p2/\u2206t, a second- order perturbation result [9].\nFor a typical PJT system the intralevel tunneling splitting \u2206t = Egap exp(\u22122EJT/h\u03bd), \u03bd is the\ncoupled bare vibrational frequency, Egap is the PJT interlevel gap energy. The current logistics\nalso estimate the flip-flop frequency as h\u03bdrot ~ \u2206t [10].\nThe exp(\u22122EJT/h\u03bd) factor (exponentially small) where EJT is Jahn-Teller's energy is known as\nHolstein's reduction factor [11]. It's entering in the denominator largely increases the\npolarizability \u03b1 beyond the 2nd order perturbation estimate. At present we have no better way\nto accout for the polarizability though extensions are under way. It should be stressed that\nonly even-order perturbation estimates are non-vanishing because the energy functional is at\nthe extremum otherwise. A VdW molecule formed as explained above is shown in Figure 3\nfor a conceivable case in the LASCO superconductor.\n4. Universal VdW binding\nThere have been suggestions that an universal molecular binding mechanism should be\noperative at the initial and later stages of the Universe to promote the formation of matter\nfrom individual atoms [12]. Here we stress that the universal binding proposal does not rule\n\n\fFigure 3: Conceivable vp pairs (bipolarons) for the high-Tc La2-xSrxCuO4 superconductor.\nout the formation of light atoms from hydrogen atoms by hydrogen synthesis. Instead, they\nare rather assumed to complement each other. While synthesis is more or less clear from the\nviewpoint of cosmology, binding is not, as far less is known of the nature of the universal\nmechanism. Many have suspected the Van-der-Waals interaction but due to its being too\nweak, even though universal, there has been a widely spread skepticism about its role in the\nuniverse.\nBut, what if the vp VdW interaction is controllable by varying some of its parameters making\nit stronger at the initial stages and weaker as the amount of primary atoms accumulates?\n\n\fIndeed, as the amount of atoms formed by synthesis and of molecules by binding increases, so\ndoes the pressure in the region of a given molecular cluster. A WdW parameter that is\nparticularly sensitive to pressure is the interlevel energy gap Esp = |Ep \u2013 Es|, the level spacing\nbetween an odd parity energy level Ep and an even parity energy level Es, familiar in the PJT\ntheories. The expected pressure coefficient being positive for a bandgap [13], it leads to the\nconclusion that the VdW force while strong at the early stages will diminish in strength as the\nmaterial pressure accumulates [14].\n\n1,40\n\n1,35\n\n2\n\n3\n\nBinding energy 2UVdW /(p /\u03baR ), (eV)\n\n-1\n\nPressure effect\n\n1,30\n\n1,25\n\n1,20\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\n2\n\nPressure P (kg/cm )\n\nFigure 4: Calculated pressure effect on the colossal Van der Waals binding energy using data\nof Ref.13. The molecular system moves to the right as the universe evolves in time.\n\nWe do not know much of the nature of the original VdW species operative at the early stages.\nThey may be sort of precursor molecules though they may have preserved the basic features\nof full-grown molecules. Indeed, as far as electrostatic polarization is concerned separate\nmolecules may act as do species within a molecular crystal [15]. This seems to lay ground to\nour basic assumption concerning isolated and crystal-borne molecules in a molecular crystal.\nThe missing universal binding is nothing but the strong polarization mechanism operating\namongst the dilute low-pressure atmosphere of precursor molecules. The typical pressure\ndependence of the energy gap in semiconductors is shown in Figure 4 [13].\n5. Breaking down of supersymmetry\nIn particle physics, supersymmetry (SUSY) is one that relates elementary particles of one spin\nto another particle that differs by half a unit of spin, the two particles being known as\nsuperpartners. In a supersymmetric theory, for every type of boson there exists a respective\ntype of fermion, and vice versa . With electrons (fermions) and phonons (bosons) in mind as\nsuperpartners, the extended band vibronic Hamiltonian describes creation and annihilation\nprocesses which suggest that the ultimate configurational lowering by vibronic effects is\nrelated to the breakdown of supersymmentry. Considering the mixing term, e.g. [16]\n\n\f(bn1\u2020 + bn1) (an\u03b1+1\u20442\u2020 an\u03b2+1\u20442 + an\u03b2+1\u20442\u2020 an\u03b1+1\u20442) =\n(bn1\u2020 an\u03b1+1\u20442\u2020) an\u03b2+1\u20442 + (bn1\u2020an\u03b2+1\u20442\u2020) an\u03b1+1\u20442 + an\u03b1+1\u20442\u2020 (bn1an\u03b2+1\u20442) + an\u03b2+1\u20442\u2020 (bn1an\u03b1+1\u20442),\nwhere on the second row created or annihilated pairs are inserted between round brackets, the\nvibronic Hamiltonian describes the creation and annihilation of supersymmetric pairs at the\nexpense of the respective annihilation and creation of single particles which implies the\nbreakdown of supersymmetry since pairs are annihilated.\n6. Chirality in vp propagation\nConsidering the conceivable quasilocal vp rotation in equatorial plane before moving to a\nneighboring plane, we come to the conclusion that the species moves along a helical path.\nSuch free vp propagation is characterized by a finite orbital angular momentum related to the\ndistance between neighboring circular segments. The wave function of a free vp therefore is\n\u03c8(r) = \u0397(\u03c6) exp(-ikzz) where H(\u03c6) is Mathieu's planar function [6], \u03c6 is the azimuth angle, z\nis the axial coordinate. The helical motion and attached chirality may be considered inherent\nto almost free carriers [17]. It is possible that vp has a definite chirality not any of the two,\nwhich may lead to parity nonconservation as it does for the neutrino [18]. However this can\nonly be verified through experiment.\n\nFigure 5: Experimental temperature dependences of electrical resistivity curves across the\ncritical temperature showing both the low temperature low resistivity region (to the left of\nmaximum) and the high temperature high resistivity region (to the right of maximum).\nExperimental data by Professor Tokura, Tokyo University.

This curve is to be compared with the graphic material shown in Figure 5(a). A close\nrelation- ship is evidenced. From Ref.19.\n7. Colossal magnetoresistance through orbital magnetic dipoles\nThe vp helical motion along the z-axis is accompanied by surging magnetic dipoles which\nmay give rise to magnetic response of a vp medium. An appearance of that kind is the colossal\nmagnetoresistance which occurs when the vp material is heated to make a crossover across\nsome characteristic temperature TC. We built up our description on the premise that in\naccordance with the present knowledge, the conduction of the medium is through large\npolarons below TC. Above TC the polarons condense into a lattice of small vp characterized\nby high electric resistance. There is a borderline about TC which separates the two regions.\nThe borderline has been calculated and found feasible [19], as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\n8. Extension to other coupled fermion\u2013boson system\nWe have thus far considered some features of the electron-phonon vp systems that may prove\nextendable to a wider appearance. Indeed, there seem to be a number of conceivable fermionboson coupled systems that may be considered within the above context. Of these, the\nnucleon-\u03c0 meson system appears plausible. However, due to the smaller boson mass (at least\nfive times smaller than the nucleon's) no adiabatic approximation will be an useful premise.\nLikewise, an antiadiabatic approximation may also be of little practical merit too [16], so that\nnumerical methods may come to the rescue.\nAccounting for the above six vp appearances in electron-phonon systems, we consider them\nextended to more general fermion-boson systems and advise LHC experiment planners for the\nmost immediate future. It seems that the relationship between (super)symmetry breaking and\nvp formation through coupled configurational symmetry lowering may be most appealing in\nexperiments during later-initial stages following the big bang. During that time a strong\nuniversal binding mechanism may be highly effective to lay down nuclei for material cluster\nformation and related more intense accumulation of ordinary matter. Dark matter is also high\non the agenda during those stages and it's formation may be related to both the universal\n\n\fmechanism and the symmetry breaking, as expected by many.\nThe form of vp propagation characterized by chirality may also be found highly instructive,\nparticularly if it leads to the breaking of parity or to another symmetry too [17]. One is\ntempting to speculate that in such a case the left-right response of free space may be at stake,\nunless something like the parity nonconservation due to neutrino can be pointed out with\nconfidence. Colossal magneto-resistance may also lead to excitement among the\nexperimentalists, due to orbital dipoles at least as part of the story, and result in devising\nsensitive measuring units for external magnetic fields. We forsee bright prospects for common\ninfluence through interdisciplinary studies of fermion-phonon systems of whatever nature.\nWe have presently surveyed some basic vp features leaving aside others, such as self-trapping,\noptical spectra, etc. which have been dealt with in earlier publications [20].\nReferences\n[1] K.H.
