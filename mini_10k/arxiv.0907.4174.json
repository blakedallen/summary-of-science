Introduction\nSupersymmetric backgrounds play an important role both in supergravity and in supersymmetric gauge theories. In the former, they include for instance BPS black holes, whose study\nhas given many hints on the quantum nature of spacetime (see e.g. [1]). In the latter, there\nare e.g. monopoles or instantons among the supersymmetric solutions. Instantons are also\nimportant in nonsupersymmetric field theories, like in QCD, where the nonperturbative chiral U (1) anomaly in an instanton background leads to baryon number violation and to a\nsolution of the U (1) problem [2, 3]. Viewed as a solution of supersymmetric gauge theories,\nthe Yang-Mills instanton [4] preserves half of the supersymmetries, and has been important\nin checks of the AdS/CFT correspondence beyond the perturbative level, cf. [5] for a review.\nIn view of this, it is desirable to dispose of a complete classification of supersymmetric\nbackgrounds of super Yang-Mills theories. This paper represents a first step in this direction\nfor euclidean N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, which is the most important one in the context\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence. We shall directly solve the Killing spinor equations using\nspinorial geometry techniques, that have been successfully applied in the past in classifying\nsupergravity solutions [6]. The basic ingredients are an oscillator basis for the spinors in terms\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fof forms and the use of the symmetries to transform them to a preferred representative of\ntheir orbit. In this way one can construct a linear system for the background fields from any\n(set of) Killing spinor(s). It will turn out that this linear system describes generalizations\nof instantons that include also nonvanishing scalars. Quite remarkably, this system can be\nobtained by dimensional reduction of the octonionic instanton equations in eight dimensions.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce\neuclidean N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory and, to make this paper self-contained, briefly\ndiscuss the usual instanton solutions. In Sect. 3, the essential information needed to realize\nspinors in terms of forms is summarized. Section 4 represents the main part of this work, in\nwhich we determine first the Killing spinor representatives as well as their stability subgroup,\nand subsequently obtain the linear system for the background fields, which is then discussed\nand related to the octonionic instanton equations. After that, we impose more Killing spinors\nand investigate which fractions of supersymmetry are possible. In Section 5 we discuss to\nwhat extent the supersymmetry conditions imply the equations of motion. We conclude in 6\nwith some final remarks. An appendix contains our notations and conventions.\n\n2.

The ten-dimensional\nLorentz group SO(9, 1) reduces then to SO(4) \u00d7 SO(5, 1), with compact space-time group\nSO(4) and non-compact R-symmetry SO(5, 1). The fields present are the gauge field A\u03bc with\nfield strength F\u03bc\u03bd , Spin(4) Weyl spinors \u03bb\u03b1,A and \u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307,A , respectively right- and left-handed,\nand six scalars \u03c6AB antisymmetric in the R-symmetry group indices A, B = 1, . . . , 4. Their\nduals are defined as \u03c6\u0304AB = 21 \u01ebABCD \u03c6CD . The trace is taken in the adjoint representation\nof the gauge group to which all the fields belong (the gauge group indices are omitted for\nclarity). The Majorana-Weyl condition imposed on the ten-dimensional spinors implies the\nso-called symplectic Majorana condition on the four-dimensional Weyl spinors2 (the usual\n1\n\nNote that one cannot get the theory (2.1) by simply Wick-rotating Minkowskian N = 4 SYM. In fact, the\nWick rotation of the bosonic sector of N = 4 SYM theory has no supersymmetric completion. See [11] for a\ndiscussion. Notice also that in (2.1), the scalar coming from the time component A0 of the ten-dimensional\nvector potential has a kinetic term of the wrong sign, so the theory has ghosts. It is easy to see that this (real)\nscalar is i(\u03c614 + \u03c623 ).\n2\nUnless specified otherwise, equations which involve complex conjugation of fields will be understood as\nnot Lie algebra valued, i.e. they hold for the components \u03bba,\u03b1,A etc.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fMajorana condition cannot be imposed in four euclidean dimensions):\n(\u03bb\u03b1,A )\u2217 = \u2212\u03b71AB \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bb\u03b2,B = \u03b71AB \u03bbB\n\u03b1\n\n(\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307,A )\u2217 = \u2212\u03b71AB \u01eb\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 \u03bb\u0304\u03b2\u0307,B = \u2212\u03b71AB \u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307B ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the definition of the 't Hooft symbols \u03b7aAB and other conventions are collected in\nappendix A.

Therefore, plugging (2.10) (e.g. for a selfdual field strength F + ) in the susy variation leads\n(for vanishing scalars) to\n!\n!\n\u01eb+\n0\n0\n,\n(2.11)\n\u03b4\u03bb \u223c\n\u01eb\u2212\n0 (F + )\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\nshowing that the configuration is half-supersymmetric. In the N = 1 theory, the spinors are\ntaken chiral and according to the choice of chirality either the instanton or the anti-instanton\nrepresent maximally supersymmetric solutions.\nNote that in theories with N > 1, many configurations preserving one or more supersymmetries do not have (anti-)selfdual field strength. We shall see this explicitely below.\nA class of finite-action solutions of euclidean Yang-Mills theory was explicitly constructed\nby Belavin et al. [4] (see also [8, 12] for reviews). The field strength is selfdual and the gauge\npotential for k = 1 and gauge group SU (2) (in regular gauge) takes the form\nAa\u03bc (x; x0 , \u03c1) = 2\n\na (x \u2212 x )\u03bd\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n0\n,\n2\n(x \u2212 x0 ) + \u03c12\n\n(2.12)\n\na are the\nwhere the arbitrary parameters x\u03bc0 and \u03c1 are called collective coordinates and \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n't Hooft symbols defined in appendix A. Taking into account the gauge orientation, the\ntotal number of collective coordinates in this situation is 8 [8]. One can show by computing\nthe index of the Dirac operator in an instanton background (with selfdual field strength)\nthat there are 4N k bosonic collective coordinates for an instanton with winding number k\nand gauge group SU (N ), counting the number of solutions to the selfduality equations with\nfixed topological charge k [8]. This calculation also reveals that in the background of an\n(anti-)instanton, the Dirac equation can have non-trivial solutions \u03bb\u0304cl (\u03bbcl ) only for negative\n(positive) chirality spinors, and that the number of such solutions in 2N k [8]. These zero\nmodes are parametrized by the so-called fermionic collective coordinates.\nIn euclidean super Yang-Mills theories, the previous results can be generalized as follows.\nFirst, an obvious solution to the equations of motion is given by (2.10) with all the other\nfields vanishing. Also, when scalar fields are absent (such as in N = 1 SYM) or uncoupled to\nfermions, another solution is given by F (anti-)selfdual, \u03bb\u0304 = \u03bb\u0304cl (\u03bb = \u03bbcl ) and all remaining\nfields vanishing. But as soon as fermion-scalar couplings are turned on, as in the case of\nN = 4 SYM, the latter configuration no longer solves the equations of motion (2.6)-(2.9).\nFor the sake of definiteness, let us remind an iterative way to construct solutions when the\ngauge group is SU (2) [12]. Start from a configuration \u03a6 = (A = Acl , \u03c6AB = \u03bbA = \u03bb\u0304A = 0),\nwhere Acl is a gauge potential for a selfdual field strength. A new solution is obtained by\ni\u03b6\u0304A Q\u0304A\n\n\u03a6(\u03b6\u0304) = e\n\n\u221e\nX\n1 n\n\u03a6=\n\u03b4 \u03a6,\nn!\nn=0\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fwhere the Q\u0304A are the susy generators, and the last equality comes from expanding perturbatively in the fermionic susy parameter \u03b6\u0304. Due to the anti-selfduality of \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd , the third equation\nA\nof (2.5) implies ei\u03b6 QA \u03a6 = \u03a6, and therefore the positive chirality susy generators cannot be\nused to generate from \u03a6 a new solution. Using (2.5), and starting from the configuration \u03a6,\none successively obtains\n(0)\n\nA = Acl ,\n1\n(1)\n\u03bb\u0304A = \u2212 \u03c3\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b6\u0304A (0)F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n1\n1\n(2) AB\n\u03c6\n= \u221a \u01ebABCD \u03b6\u0304C (1) \u03bb\u0304D = \u2212 \u221a \u01ebABCD \u03b6\u0304C \u03c3\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b6\u0304D (0)F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n2 2\n\u221a\n\u0001\ni\ni 2\n(3) \u03b1,A\n\u03b6\u0304\u03b1\u0307,B D\n/ \u03b1\u03b1\u0307(2)\u03c6AB = \u01ebABCD \u03c3\u03c1 \u03b1\u03b2\u0307 \u03b6\u0304\u03b2\u0307,B \u03b6\u0304C \u03c3\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b6\u0304D D \u03c1(0)F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03bb\n=\u2212\n3\n6\n\u0001\n\u0001\ni\n1\n(4)\nA\u03bc = \u2212 \u03b6\u0304A \u03c3\u0304\u03bc (3)\u03bbA =\n\u01ebABCD \u03b6\u0304A \u03c3\u0304\u03bc\u03c1 \u03b6\u0304B \u03b6\u0304C \u03c3\u0304 \u03c3\u03bd \u03b6\u0304D D \u03c1(0)F\u03c3\u03bd ,\n4\n24\n..\n.\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the number of susy parameters \u03b6\u0304 contained in the field. It\nturns out that \u03b6\u0304 is one of the two two-component fermionic collective coordinates for the\nSU (2) gauge group. The other one is obtained by using superconformal supersymmetry\ntransformation laws [12]. The fact that all fermionic zero modes can be generated by means\nof ordinary supersymmetry and superconformal transformations is specific to SU (2), and the\nsituation is more involved for SU (N > 2) [12]. The solution constructed iteratively in this\nway is called super-instanton (cf. [5, 12, 13] for reviews).\n\n3. Spinorial geometry of four-dimensional euclidean space\nIn this section we summarize the essential information needed to realize spinors of Spin(4) in\nterms of forms [6]. For more details, we refer to [15]. Consider the real vector space V = R4\nendowed with its canonical scalar product and orthonormal basis {e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 }. Define the\nsubspace U spanned by the first two basis elements, U = span(e1 , e2 ). The space of Dirac\nspinors \u2206C is defined as the exterior algebra of U \u2297 C,\n\u2206C = \u039b\u2217 (U \u2297 C) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhich is nothing else than SpanC (1, e1 , e2 , e1 \u2227 e2 =: e12 ). A generic Dirac spinor is thus\nwritten as\n\u03bb = \u03bb0 1 + \u03bb1 e1 + \u03bb2 e2 + \u03bb12 e12 ,\n(3.2)\nand has 4 complex degrees of freedom as it should. The gamma matrices are represented on\n\u2206C as\n\u03b3i \u03bb = ei \u2227 \u03bb + ei y\u03bb ,\n\n\u03b3i+2 \u03bb = iei \u2227 \u03bb \u2212 iei y\u03bb ,\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere i = 1, 2, and the contraction operator y is defined though its action on a k-form as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nei y\n\u03b7i1 ...ik ei1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 eik =\n\u03b7ij ...j ej \u2227 . . . \u2227 ejk\u22121 .\n(3.4)\nk!\n(k \u2212 1)! 1 k\u22121 1\nOne easily checks that this representation of the gamma matrices satisfies the Clifford algebra\nrelations {\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd } = 2\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd . Note that the elements ei are indistinctly viewed as vectors or forms\naccording to the objects on which they are acting. From the definition of the chirality matrix\n\u03b35 = \u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b33 \u03b34 and (3.3), one readily sees that\n\u03b35 1 = 1 ,\n\u03b35 e12 = e12 ,\n\u03b35 e1 = \u2212e1 , \u03b35 e2 = \u2212e2 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nso that the usual split of the space of Dirac spinors into positive and negative chirality Weyl\nspinors here amounts to the split \u2206C = \u2206+ \u2295 \u2206\u2212 into forms of even degree 1, e12 and forms\nof odd degree e1 , e2 . This decomposition is invariant under the euclidean Lorentz group\nSO(4) = SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2), with each subspace transforming under a different SU (2) factor.\nLet us define the hermitian inner product\ni\n\nj\n\nha ei |b ej i =\n\n2\nX\n\na \u2217 i bi\n\n(3.6)\n\ni=1\n\non U \u2297 C, and then extend it to \u2206C . This yields the Spin(4) invariant Dirac inner product\non the space of spinors \u2206C ,\nD(\u03b7, \u03b8) = h\u03b7|\u03b8i .\n\n(3.7)\n\nIt reveals quite useful for practical purposes to switch to another basis for the gamma matrices,\ndefining\n1\n\u03931 = \u221a (\u03b31 \u2212 i\u03b33 ) ,\n2\n1\n\u03932 = \u221a (\u03b32 \u2212 i\u03b34 ) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03931\u0304 = \u221a (\u03b31 + i\u03b33 ) ,\n2\n1\n\u03932\u0304 = \u221a (\u03b32 + i\u03b34 ) .\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn this new basis, the gamma matrices satisfy {\u0393A , \u0393B } = 2\u03b7AB , A, B = {1, 1\u0304, 2, 2\u0304}, where\nthe non-vanishing components of the metric are \u03b711\u0304 = \u03b71\u03041 = 1, \u03b722\u0304 = \u03b72\u03042 = 1.\nThe advantage of this new basis stems from the fact that the \u0393A satisfy a fermionic\nannihilation-creation operator algebra, since {\u03931 , \u03931\u0304 } = 2, {\u03932 , \u03932\u0304 } = 2, for which the spinor\n1 can be identified as the vacuum state, being annihilated by \u03931\u0304 and \u03932\u0304 :\n\u03931\u0304 1 = \u03932\u0304 1 = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nAll the other states can be constructed by acting with \u03931 and \u03932 on 1.

This is summarized in table 1, where another simplification coming from\nthe use of the basis (3.8) is apparent from the vanishing of half of the entries of this table3 .\nWe will sometimes use another basis, in which the gamma matrices are given by (A.5).\nThe spinors {1, e1 , e2 , e12 } can easily be expressed in that basis by starting from (3.9) and\nacting with the creation operators on the vacuum.

Classification of supersymmetric solutions\n4.1 Representatives\nThe spinorial geometry approach is tailored to fully exploit the linearity of the Killing spinor\nequations. One of its basic ingredients is the use of the symmetries of the theory to transform\nthe Killing spinors to preferred representatives of their orbit under this symmetry group. This\nis the scope of the present subsection.\nUsing the results of the previous section, the Killing spinors appearing in (2.5) can be\nexpressed in the language of forms as\nA \u03b1\n\u03be \u03b1,A = \u03c90A 1\u03b1 + \u03c912\ne12 ,\n\n\u03be\u0304\u03b1\u0307,A = \u03c91,A e1 \u03b1\u0307 + \u03c92,A e2 \u03b1\u0307 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03c9 A (A = 1, . . . , 4) are complex numbers that are related by the symplectic Majorana condition (2.2), which imposes the following structure:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\na\n\uf8ecb\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u03c90 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8edc\uf8f8\nd\n\n\u03c912\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212d\u2217\n\uf8ec \u2212c\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec \u2217 \uf8f7,\n\uf8ed b \uf8f8\na\u2217\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\ne\n\uf8ecf \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u03c91 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8edg\uf8f8\nh\n\n\uf8f6\nh\u2217\n\uf8ec g\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c92 = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\u2217\n\uf8ed \u2212f \uf8f8\n\u2212e\u2217\n\uf8eb\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis structure is preserved both by the SO(4) Lorentz and by the SO(5, 1) internal Rsymmetry transformations [8]. We are now going to use the latter symmetries to simplify the\nform (4.1)-(4.2) of a generic Killing spinor.

For the\nrepresentative (4.3), one checks that the SO(5, 1) generators stabilizing it are\n1\nS1 = (\u03b3\u0302 25 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 36 ) ,\n2\n\n1\nS2 = (\u03b3\u0302 23 + \u03b3\u0302 56 ) ,\n2\n\nS3 =\n\n1 26\n(\u03b3\u0302 + \u03b3\u0302 35 ) ,\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nS4 = (\u03b3\u0302 15 + \u03b3\u0302 45 ) ,\nS5 = (\u03b3\u0302 12 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 24 ) ,\nS6 = (\u03b3\u0302 16 + \u03b3\u0302 46 ) ,\nS7 = (\u03b3\u0302 13 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 34 ) ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere S1 , S2 and S3 form an su(2) subalgebra, while S4 , * * * , S7 form an abelian ideal. Being\na right chiral spinor of Spin(4), it is also stabilized by the SU (2)L subgroup of Spin(4)\ngenerated by \u039311\u0304 \u2212 \u039322\u0304 , \u039312\u0304 and \u03931\u03042 . On the other hand, the SU (2)R generators \u039311\u0304 + \u039322\u0304 ,\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f\u039312 and \u03931\u03042\u0304 only mix the forms 1 and e12 (Spin(4) transformations preserve chirality), so that\napplying an SU (2)R transformation to the representative (4.3) yields again a spinor of the\nform \u03c90 1 + \u03c912 e12 , with \u03c90 , \u03c912 given in (4.2). But, as we just explained, that spinor is in\nthe same orbit as (4.3) under SO(5, 1). The action of the SU (2)R can thus be compensated\nby a subsequent SO(5, 1) transformation. It is easy to see that the SO(5, 1) generators\naccomplishing this are\n1\n1\n1 25\n(\u03b3\u0302 + \u03b3\u0302 36 ) ,\nS9 = (\u03b3\u0302 23 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 56 ) ,\nS10 = (\u03b3\u0302 26 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302 35 ) ,\n(4.7)\n2\n2\n2\nwhich of course span an su(2) algebra that commutes with the one formed by S1 , . . . , S3 .\nTogether, S1 , . . . , S10 generate the Euclidean group SO(4)\u22c9R4 \u223c\n= ISO(4), so that the stability\nsubgroup of (4.3) is SU (2)L \u00d7 ISO(4).\nLet us see how a second Killing spinor can be simplified using the stability subgroup of\nthe first. It can have either the same chirality, or the opposite one4 . First assume that the\nsecond one has the same chirality. It can thus be written as\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na\n\u2212d\u2217\n\uf8ecb\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212c\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03be2 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec \u2217 \uf8f7 e12 .\n(4.8)\n\uf8edc\uf8f8\n\uf8ed b \uf8f8\na\u2217\nd\nS8 =\n\nOne observes that when the second spinor is of the form\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na\n\u2212d\u2217\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(1)\n\u03be2 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 e12 ,\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\na\u2217\nd\n\n(4.9)\n\nwe may use an SU (2)R transformation (compensated by S8 , . . . , S10 ) to choose a, d \u2208 R. The\nresidual isotropy group leaving invariant (4.3) as well as (4.9) is then given by SU (2)L \u00d7\n((U (1) \u00d7 SU (2)) \u22c9 R4 ), with the U (1) generated by S9 . (4.9) actually belongs to the same\nLorentz orbit as (4.3), in that an arbitrary right SO(4) chiral spinor a1 \u2212 d\u2217 e12 can always\nbe brought to the spinor \u03c12 1, \u03c1 \u2208 R by means of an SO(4) transformation (to show this,\nconsider e.g. exp(\u03b1\u03b3 13 )exp(\u03b2\u03b3 23 )exp(\u03b4\u03b3 13 ) acting on \u03c12 1). Actually, since the Killing spinor\nequations (2.5) are linear in the spinorial parameter, we will generally forget about the scaling\nfactor \u03c12 .\nOn the other hand, when b or c are different from zero, the second spinor can, up to an\noverall factor, be brought to the form\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n0\n0\n\uf8ec1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n(2)\n\u03be2 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec \uf8f7 e12 ,\n(4.10)\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n\uf8ed1\uf8f8\n0\n0\n4\n\nHere, we will always consider Killing spinors with a definite chirality. This is restrictive, but as far as\ninstantons are concerned, it is the most important case.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fusing the generators S1 , . . . , S7 (this is obvious by acting on (4.10) with e\u03b1S1 e\u03b2S2 e\u03b3S1 e\u03b4S7\ne\u03b7S6 e\u03b8S5 e\u03a9S4 ). The spinor (4.10) is further stabilized by S8 , S9 and S10 .\nWe will use the following pictorial representation. Without loss of generality, the first\nchiral Killing spinor can always be taken of the form (4.3). Next, a configuration admitting\nas Killing spinors (4.3) and (4.9) will be represented by\n\u2022 \u2022\n\n,\nwhile a configuration admitting as Killing spinors (4.3) and (4.10) shall be denoted by\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n.\n\nEach dot represents a Killing spinor. A solution can have at most 8 real Killing spinors\nof the same chirality, here right. Spinors that can be related by a Spin(4) transformation are\nwritten on the same line. In the second case, for example, the two Killing spinors can only\nbe related by an internal SO(5, 1) transformation.\nOne can also consider Killing spinors of different chiralities. Let us again fix the first\nspinor to be of the form (4.3), and use its stability subgroup to simplify a left chiral spinor\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ne\nh\u2217\n\uf8ecf \uf8f7\n\uf8ec g\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03be\u0304 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 e1 + \uf8ec\n(4.11)\n\uf8f7 e2 .\n\uf8edg\uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u2212f \u2217 \uf8f8\n\u2212e\u2217\nh\n\nThere are again two cases. If e or h is different from zero, one can use the Lorentz subgroup\nSU (2)L as well as S4 , . . . , S7 to bring the left chiral spinor to\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c12\n0\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(1)\n\u03be \u03042 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 e1 + \uf8ec\n(4.12)\n\uf8f7 e2 .\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n0\n\u2212\u03c12\n\nThis spinor is still invariant under SO(4) transformations generated by S1 , . . . , S3 and S8 , . . . , S10 .\nOn the other hand, if e = h = 0, the generators of the SU (2)L subgroup (or equivalently the\ngenerators S1 , S2 and S3 ) can be used to cast it into the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u03c12 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(2)\n\u03be \u03042 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 e1 + \uf8ec 2 \uf8f7 e2 ,\n(4.13)\n\uf8ed \u2212\u03c1 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n\nwhich is still stabilized by S4 , . . . , S10 . Note that (4.12) and (4.13) are actually related by\nSO(5, 1) transformations, but not of the type (4.6) stabilizing (4.3). This actually shows that\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fa generic Dirac spinor can be brought either to the form (4.3)+(4.12) or to (4.3)+(4.13),\ni.e. there are two orbits under the Lorentz and internal symmetry groups for a generic Killing\nspinor.\nAllowing for Killing spinors of different chiralities, a solution can preserve at most 16\nreal supersymmetries. Again, we will make use of a pictorial representation to visualize the\ndifferent possible supersymmetric configurations in an easy way. A solution admitting (4.3)\nand (4.12) as Killings spinors will be written as\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2261 (1, 0, 1, 0) ,\n\nwhile one admitting (4.3) and (4.13) is denoted by\n\u2022\n\n\u2261 (1, 0, 0, 1) .\n\u2022\n\nWe make use of the shorthand notation (n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 ) to indicate the number ni of\nKilling spinors lying in the ith Spin(4) orbit, whose representatives are given respectively by\n(4.3), (4.10), (4.12), (4.13). There are obviously symmetries of these diagrams that would\nyield equivalent configurations. For example, up to the choice of chirality of the first Killing\nspinor, the configurations obtained by exchanging the first two lines with the last two ones\nare equivalent, e.g. (2, 0, 1, 0) = (1, 0, 2, 0), (4, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 4, 0) etc.\n4.2 Bosonic configurations\nLet us now use the machinery of the previous section to classify the purely bosonic configurations.

Similar\nequations appeared previously in [16,17]5 . The reason of why four of the scalars combine to a\none-form (which at first sight appears to transform differently under Lorentz transformations)\nlies in the stability subgroup of the spinor (4.3): As was explained in section 4.1, once we fix\nthe representative (4.3), we are free to do SO(4) \u223c\n= SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R Lorentz rotations only\n5\n\nRef. [17] deals with a twisted version of N = 4 SYM that is relevant to the geometric Langlands program.\nThis gives a family of topological field theories parametrized by some t that takes values in the one-dimensional\ncomplex projective space. Taking t \u2192 \u221e in eqns. (3.29) of [17] yields our system (4.20)-(4.22).\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fif the SU (2)R is compensated by a subsequent SO(5, 1) transformation, and the scalar fields\ndo transform under the latter.

Notice also that the Hitchin equations arise by reduction of the selfduality\nequations from four to two dimensions [18]6 . This raises the question of whether the system (4.20)-(4.22) also has a higher-dimensional origin. This is indeed the case: Consider the\nhigher-dimensional analogue of the selfduality equations [20],\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F \u03c1\u03c3 = \u03bbF\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4.26)\n2\nwhere \u03bb is a number and the tensor T\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is totally antisymmetric. If the dimension D is\nhigher than four, T\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 cannot be invariant under SO(D) anymore. The authors of [20]\nclassified all possible choices for T\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 up to D = 8, requiring that T\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 be invariant under\na maximal subgroup of SO(D). They found that the case D = 8 is of particular interest,\nbecause it generalizes most closely the concept of four-dimensional selfduality. For D = 8 and\nthe choice Spin(7) as maximal subgroup of SO(8) there are two possible eigenvalues \u03bb = 1\nand \u03bb = \u22123 [20]. The former leads to the set of seven equations7\nF32 + F14 + F56 + F78 = 0 ,\nF31 + F42 + F57 + F86 = 0 ,\nF34 + F21 + F76 + F85 = 0 ,\nF35 + F62 + F71 + F48 = 0 ,\nF36 + F25 + F18 + F47 = 0 ,\nF37 + F82 + F15 + F64 = 0 ,\nF38 + F27 + F61 + F54 = 0 ,\n6\n\n(4.27)\n\nReduction of the selfduality equations from four to three dimensions yields the monopole equations. In\ngravity, the four-dimensional self-duality equations with one Killing direction imply the 3d Einstein-Weyl\nequations [19].\n7\nWith respect to [20], we interchanged the 1- and 3-directions.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fcalled octonionic instanton equations, since they can be rephrased using the structure constants of the octonions [20]. Now decompose the vector potential as\nAM = (A\u03bc , \u2212\u03c63 , \u03c62 , \u03c61 , \u2212\u03c64 ) ,\nwhere M = 1, . . . , 8 and \u03bc = 1, . . . , 4, and suppose that the fields A\u03bc , \u03c6\u03bc are independent of\nthe coordinates x5 , . . . , x8 . Then the octonionic instanton equations (4.27) yield exactly the\nsystem (4.20)-(4.22)8 .\nLooking at (4.18), we observe that the field \u03c623 is covariantly constant and commutes with\nany other scalar. In what follows, we will refer to these conditions as decoupling conditions.\nMoreover, the field \u03c614 does not appear in the susy equations (except through the fact that it\ncommutes with \u03c623 ). This implies that the ghost i(\u03c614 + \u03c623 ) decouples from the other fields\nin the supersymmetry constraints.\nComparing (4.17) to (3.13), we see that in presence of scalars the field strength F is\nno longer selfdual, but the complex field strength F does obey the selfduality-like equation\n(4.24). It would be interesting to see if one can use (4.24) to construct generalizations of\ninstantons to include nonvanishing scalars9 .\nWe shall now analyze what happens when requiring the existence of more Killing spinors.\n4.2.1 Killing spinors of same chirality\nOne can add a further Killing spinor of the same chirality to the original configuration\n(1, 0, 0, 0) in two different ways, either one in the same Lorentz orbit as the first, namely\n(2, 0, 0, 0), or the other one (1, 1, 0, 0).\nLet us first consider the former case, i.e., we take a second spinor of the form (4.9).\nEquations (4.17) are supplemented with\nIm(d[\u03c612 , \u03c613 ]) = 0 ,\nd([\u03c612 , \u03c634 ] \u2212 [\u03c613 , \u03c624 ]) + 2iIm(a)[\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] = 0 ,\n\n\u22122iIm(a)D 2\u0304 \u03c613 \u2212 d\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c634 \u2212 dD 1 \u03c613 = 0 ,\n\n2iIm(a)D 2\u0304 \u03c612 + d\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c624 + dD 1 \u03c612 = 0 .\n\n(4.28)\n\nFrom these equations, one easily gets the constraints coming from the presence of more Killing\nspinors on the same Lorentz orbit, i.e. configurations (3, 0, 0, 0) and (4, 0, 0, 0). First, one may\nverify that the constraints coming by considering an additional third Killing spinor forces the\nfield strength to be selfdual, while giving further constraints on the covariant derivatives and\ncommutators of the scalar fields. For (4, 0, 0, 0), one may combine (4.17) with the equations\nobtained from (4.28) with (a, d) = (i, 0), (0, 1), (0, i) which generate a basis for the entire\n8\n\nThe relation of BPS equations in euclidean N = 4 SYM to the octonionic instanton equations was noticed\nbefore in [16] for the case of two active scalars.\n9\nA particular type of such solutions, termed ic-instantons, was constructed explicitely in [16].\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\forbit. We obtain the following conditions:\n\uf8f1 11\u0304\nF + F 22\u0304 = 0 ,\nF 12 = 0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n23 AB\n\uf8f4\n\u2200 A, B ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 [\u03c6 , \u03c6 ] = 0\n\u03bc\nAB\n(4, 0, 0, 0)\n\u21d4\nD \u03c6\n=0\n\u2200 A, B but for \u03c614 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 [\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] = [\u03c612 , \u03c613 ] = 0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 12 34\n[\u03c6 , \u03c6 ] = [\u03c613 , \u03c624 ] .\n\n(4.29)\n\nThe scalar field \u03c614 is thus the only field which is left completely unconstrained (except from\nits vanishing commutator with \u03c623 ). Adding one more chiral Killing spinor to (4, 0, 0, 0)\ndirectly leads to the instanton solution with selfdual field strength, and vanishing covariant\nderivatives and commutators for all scalar fields. It is clear from (4.14) that this solution\npreserves 8 real supersymmetries, thus\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWe now focus on the latter case, i.e. (1, 1, 0, 0). Combining (4.17) with the constraints\ncoming from (4.10), one gets\nF 11\u0304 + F 22\u0304 \u2212 [\u03c612 , \u03c634 ] = 0 ,\n\nF 1\u03042\u0304 + [\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] = 0 ,\nD 1 \u03c634 \u2212 D 2\u0304 \u03c613 = 0 ,\n\nD 1 \u03c624 \u2212 D 2\u0304 \u03c612 = 0 ,\n\n(4.30)\n\n[\u03c623 , \u03c6AB ] = [\u03c614 , \u03c6AB ] = [\u03c613 + \u03c624 , \u03c6AB ] = 0 ,\nD \u03bc \u03c623 = D \u03bc \u03c614 = D \u03bc (\u03c613 + \u03c624 ) = 0 .\nTherefore three purely imaginary fields decouple. Let us consider the constraints coming from\nthe existence of a third spinor of the same chirality. The latter is completely generic and is\nof the form (4.1)-(4.2). Taking into account (4.30), the system one obtains is\nIm(d[\u03c612 , \u03c624 ]) = 0 ,\nIm(c[\u03c612 , \u03c624 ]) = 0 ,\n2iIm(b)[\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] + c[\u03c612 , \u03c634 ] = 0 ,\n2iIm(a)[\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] + d[\u03c612 , \u03c634 ] = 0 ,\n2iIm(b)D 2\u0304 \u03c624 + c\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c634 \u2212 cD 1 \u03c624 = 0 ,\n\n2iIm(a)D 2\u0304 \u03c624 + d\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c634 \u2212 dD 1 \u03c624 = 0 ,\n\n2iIm(b)D 1 \u03c624 + cD 1 \u03c612 + c\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c624 = 0 ,\n\n2iIm(a)D 1 \u03c624 + dD 1 \u03c612 + d\u2217 D 2\u0304 \u03c624 = 0 .\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n(4.31)\n\n\fThe precise form of the equations is not really important, but what is worth noticing is that\nif this third spinor is indeed Killing, then it is also the case for the two independent spinors\non a given Lorentz orbit in which it can be decomposed:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\na\n\u2212d\u2217\na\n\u2212d\u2217\n0\n0\n\uf8ecb\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212c\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ecb\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212c\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03be3 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec \u2217 \uf8f7 e12 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec\n(4.32)\n\uf8f7 e12 + \uf8ec \uf8f7 1 + \uf8ec \u2217 \uf8f7 e12 ,\n\uf8edc\uf8f8\n\uf8ed b \uf8f8\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8edc\uf8f8\n\uf8ed b \uf8f8\na\u2217\nd\nd\na\u2217\n0\n0\n\nsince the coefficients (a, d) and (b, c) do not mix.

Naturally, after the second one, all spinors\ncannot be further simplified and have to be taken generic, of the form (4.39). Again, the\nequations involving the covariant derivatives of the scalar fields are rather involved and do not\ntell much, so we will focus on the field strength. From (1, 0, 0, 2), one observes that F 1\u03042 = 0,\nalthough F is not yet anti-selfdual. For the configuration (1, 0, 0, 3), as expected from section\n4.2.1, the field strength becomes anti-selfdual (as the for the configuration (0, 0, 0, 3)), while\nthe remaining component F 1\u03042\u0304 is now determined in terms of the commutator of scalars:\nF 11\u0304 = F 22\u0304 = \u2212[\u03c613 , \u03c624 ] ,\n\nF 1\u03042 = 0 ,\n\n(4.45)\n\nF 1\u03042\u0304 = \u2212[\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] .\n\nFor (1, 0, 0, 4), we get of course something very similar to (4.29), with the difference that the\nfield strength is anti-selfdual instead of selfdual, and with the additional information that can\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fbe seen in (4.45) that the components of F are related to commutators of scalar fields (which\nwas not the case in (4.29)). Adding one more Killing spinor on the orbit of the first spinor\nfurther yields F 1\u03042\u0304 = \u2212[\u03c624 , \u03c634 ] = 0.\n(1, 0, 0, 2) \u2192 (2, 0, 0, 2) \u2192 (3, 0, 0, 2)/(2, 0, 0, 3) \u2192 (3, 0, 0, 3) \u2192 (4, 0, 0, 3) = (4, 0, 0, 4)\nThe last cases that haven't yet been explored or that are not a consequence of what we\nhave seen up to now consist in adding to (1, 0, 0, 2) a Killing spinor in the Lorentz orbit\nof the first representative. The configuration (2, 0, 0, 2) will not be (anti-)selfdual, but has\nF 1\u03042 = F 12 = 0. Next, as expected, (3, 0, 0, 2) is selfdual while (2, 0, 0, 3) is anti-selfdual. As\na consequence, (3, 0, 0, 3) has vanishing field strength. Finally, one can see using a basis for\nelements on the first and fourth orbit that\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe classification of supersymmetric backgrounds of N = 4 SYM theory is summarized\nin table 3.\n1\n(1,0,0,0)\n\n2\n(2,0,0,0)\n(1,1,0,0)\n(1,0,1,0)\n(1,0,0,1)\n\n3\n(3,0,0,0)\n(2,0,0,1)\n\n4\n(4,0,0,0)\n(2,2,0,0)\n(2,0,2,0)\n(1,1,1,1)\n(2,0,0,2)\n(3,0,0,1)\n\n5\n(3,0,0,2)\n(4,0,0,1)\n\n6\n(3,0,0,3)\n(4,0,0,2)\n\n8\n(4,4,0,0)\n(4,0,4,0)\n(2,2,2,2)\n(4,0,0,4)\n\n16\n(4,4,4,4)\n\nTable 3: Classification of purely bosonic supersymmetric configurations of N = 4 SYM theory, with\nKilling spinors of definite chiralities.

An arbitrary configuration (n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 )\nif not present in the table can be shown to be equivalent to one of the above using the analysis of the\nprevious section. As an example, let us consider (2, 0, 2, 1). We have seen that (1, 0, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1, 1)\n(the equality sign meaning \"implies\"), therefore (2, 0, 2, 1) = (2, 1, 2, 1). But we also observed that\n(2, 1, 1, 1) = (2, 2, 2, 2). Therefore (2, 0, 2, 1) = (2, 2, 2, 2).\n\n5. Susy variations and equations of motion\nThe Killing spinor equations arising from setting to zero the supersymmetry variations (2.5)\nare first order, and one could ask whether they imply the second order equations of motion\n(2.6)-(2.9). In supergravity, this is not always the case: The Killing vector constructed as\na bilinear from the Killing spinor can be either timelike or lightlike. One can show that in\nthe former case, the Killing spinor equations, together with the Bianchi identities and the\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fMaxwell equations, do entail the Einstein equations, whereas in the null case, one of the\nEinstein equations must be additionally imposed by hand (cf. e.g. [21]).\nWe first focus on purely bosonic configurations. Let us consider the conditions (4.17)\nimposed by the existence of a chiral Killing spinor. One would like to check whether these\nimply\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 D \u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 [\u03c6\u0304AB , D\u03bc \u03c6AB ] = 0 ,\n2\n(5.1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 D 2 \u03c6AB \u2212 1 [\u03c6\u0304CD , [\u03c6AB , \u03c6CD ]] = 0 .\n2\nA first observation is that one the scalar fields, here \u03c614 , does not appear in the susy equations\n(except through the fact that it commutes with \u03c623 ). Therefore its equations of motion are\ncertainly not satisfied by virtue of the susy equations, and the former will have to be imposed\nby hand. However, all the other equations of motion will automatically hold, using only\n(4.17), the Jacobi identity and the Bianchi identities for the gauge field, as we illustrate now.\nConsider the first equation of (5.1) for e.g. \u03bc = 1. By expanding it, using the definition\n\u03c6\u0304AB = 12 \u01ebABCD \u03c6CD for the duals and the fact that \u03c623 decouples, one gets\nD 1\u0304 F 11\u0304 + D 2 F 2\u03041\u0304 + D 2\u0304 F 21\u0304\n?\n\n\u2212[\u03c634 , D1 \u03c612 ] \u2212 [\u03c642 , D1 \u03c613 ] \u2212 [\u03c631 , D1 \u03c624 ] \u2212 [\u03c612 , D1 \u03c634 ] = 0 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nNow use the Bianchi identity\nD 2\u0304 F 21\u0304 = D 2 F 2\u03041\u0304 + D 1\u0304 F 22\u0304 ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nto replace the term D 1\u0304 F 11\u0304 +D 2 F 2\u03041\u0304 +D 2\u0304 F 21\u0304 in (5.2) by 2D 2 F 2\u03041\u0304 +D 1\u0304 (F 11\u0304 +F 22\u0304 ) and finally the\ntwo first equations of (4.17) to eliminate the field strengths in terms of commutators of scalar\nfields, to see that they exactly cancel the scalar field part in (5.2). The other components are\nsatisfied in the same way.\nWe now turn to the second equation of (5.1) and show explicitly how things combine\nfor A = 1, B = 3. (For all other index combinations except A = 1, B = 4, the proof is\nanalogous). First the D\u03bc D \u03bc \u03c613 term is rewritten as 2(D 1 D 1\u0304 + D 2 D 2\u0304 )\u03c613 \u2212 [F 11\u0304 + F 22\u0304 , \u03c613 ]\nwhich, using the third equation of (4.17), as well as the complex conjugate of the fourth,\nboils down to \u22122[F 12 , \u03c613 ] \u2212 [F 11\u0304 + F 22\u0304 , \u03c613 ]. Using then the first and the complex conjugate\nof the second equation of (4.17), one arrives at a sum of 3 multicommutator terms involving\nonly \u03c612 , \u03c613 and \u03c634 which vanishes by virtue of the Jacobi identity.\n\n6. Final remarks\nIn this work we have discussed the classification of supersymmetric solutions of euclidean N =\n4 SYM theory in 4 dimensions. We have displayed the equations they satisfy in the spinorial\ngeometry language. The equations one gets by imposing the existence of a single Killing spinor\ncan be obtained by dimensional reduction from 8 to 4 dimensions of the octonionic instanton\nequations, much like the Hitchin equations arise by reduction of the selfduality equations\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\ffrom 4 to 2 dimensions. The system of equations may be rephrased compactly in terms of\na selfduality-like condition for a complex connection. We next wrote down the equations\narising by imposing the existence of more Killing spinors (focusing on Killing spinors with\ndefinite chiralities). Their analysis led to the conclusion that not all fractions of the maximal\nnumber of supersymmetries are allowed. In particular, there are no bosonic configurations\npreserving 7 supersymmetries (because this automatically implies the existence of an 8th\nKilling spinor) nor 9 to 15 (that would imply 16). This is reminiscent of more familiar\nset-ups, for instance from general relativity (no metrics with 8 or 9 Killing vectors in 4\ndimensions), and supergravity (e.g. no BPS solutions in eleven-dimensional sugra preserving\n31 supersymmetries [22]).\nWe focused on purely bosonic configurations, but solutions with non-trivial fermionic\nfields are of course not excluded and are certainly worth studying. Also, it would be desirable\nto work out explicit solutions to these various sets of equations and verify whether their\ncorresponding on-shell action is finite. In the affirmative, the corresponding configurations\nwould represent instantons possibly including non-trivial scalar and fermion fields profiles,\nwhich as of today are not known in closed form10 . The interest in instanton effects in N = 4\nSYM is at least twofold. On the one hand, the theory is believed to be self-dual [25], a\nstatement entailing the complete effective action including all instanton and anti-instanton\neffects. On the other hand, instantons have provided some of the most striking tests of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. From this point of view, instantons with topological charge k\nin N = 4 SYM with SU (N ) gauge group are obtained by adding k D-instantons (D(-1)\nbranes) to the stack of N D3 branes [27\u201330] (for unoriented D-instantons, one starts with\nD3-branes on top of an orientifold 3-plane, the gauge group of the N = 4 SYM theory\nbecoming Sp(N ) or SO(N ) depending on the charge of the O3-plane [26]). In the low energy\nsupergravity limit where computations can mostly be performed (see however [5], Sect. 18.3\nfor a discussion beyond sugra, in the BMN limit), D-instantons arise as non-trivial solutions\nof the Euclidean field equations. The classical type IIB supergravity action in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\ncan take these into account by incorporating the effect of the infinite tower of massive string\nexcitations on the dynamics of the massless modes. In the case of minimal correlators/AdS\namplitudes, it turns out there is a perfect agreement between instanton contributions to SYM\ncorrelation functions and D-instanton induced supergravity amplitudes (see [31\u201333], or [5],\nSects.15-18, [12] for reviews). Of course, this agreement is striking since the computations\non the field theory side are done at weak coupling, and indicates that the corresponding\ncorrelators are protected from quantum corrections. On the gauge theory side, the latter\ncomputations are performed in a particular instanton background. The latter is generated\nfrom the self-dual configuration, starting from the YM instanton and solving iteratively the\nfull set of coupled equations to get an approximated truncated solution by retaining terms\nonly up to a certain power of the coupling constant, which is enough to compute correlators in\nthe semi-classical approximation, see e.g. Sect.14 of [5]). If new finite-action solutions would\n10\n\nNote that it has been argued that such a solution may not exist for generic gauge group [13]\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fappear to exist, in particular with non (anti-)selfdual field strength, it would certainly be a\nvery interesting problem to compute their contribution to correlation functions and match it\nwith a dual supergravity computation.\nFinally, the AdS/CFT correspondence has also allowed to give a string theory interpretation of SYM states. For example, it is known that monopoles and dyons are dual to D-strings\nand bound states of D-strings and fundamental strings, respectively, between different D3branes. In the same spirit, 1/4 BPS states in N = 4 SYM with a gauge group SU(3) have\nbeen shown to correspond to three-pronged strings connecting three D3-branes [23]. It would\ntherefore be really interesting to identify to which configurations on the gravity side these\nvarious supersymmetric solutions (or their counterparts in the lorentzian theory) are mapped\nthrough the AdS/CFT correspondence. The strategy of the present analysis is of course not\nlimited to four-dimensional N = 4 SYM, and could be applied to any supersymmetric gauge\ntheory. An example of particular interest are the superconformal three-dimensional ChernSimons theories recently proposed in the context of the AdS4 /CF T3 corespondence [24]. We\nhope to return to these questions in future works.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by INFN, MIUR-PRIN contract 20075ATT78 and by the\nEuropean Community FP6 program MRTN-CT-2004-005104.
