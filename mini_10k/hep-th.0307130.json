This duality is strictly related to scaling properties of\nthe matrix model free energy. The latter has been also useful in investigating the exact\nstructure of the free energy, leading to the appearance of new bilinear terms depending on\nan odd integer [6]. In this respect we note that, in particular theories, the are interesting\nquestions concerning the contributions at order S h , with h the dual Coxeter number [7].\nIn this note we will consider the chiral ring structure for pure N = 1 SU (N ) gauge\ntheory and we will argue that the classical relation [2]\n2\n\nN\n= 0,\nScl\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\u03b1\nis the glueball superfield, gets modified to the exact quantum\nwhere S = \u2212 32\u03c0\n2 Tr W\u03b1 W\nrelation\n\u0001N\nS N \u2212 \u039b3N\n= 0.\n(2)\n\nLet us consider the gaugino condensate in the case of SU (N ). Properties of the trace\nfor SU (N ) show that classically also the following relation [2]\nN\nScl\n= {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 },\n\n(3)\n\nholds, whose generalization to gauge groups Sp(N ) and SO(N ) has been derived by Witten\nin [3]. Subsequently, in [8] it has been verified the structure of the classical ring for the\nexceptional Lie group G2 conjectured in [3]. Instantons modify Eq.(3) to the exact operator\nrelation [2]\nS N = \u039b3N + {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 },\n(4)\n2\n\nthat generalizes to other groups [3]. Similarly, also S N = 0 receives instanton corrections.\nIn particular, consistency with the above finding implies that there is the exact operator\nrelation\nP(S N , \u039b3N ) = 0,\n(5)\nwhere P \u2261 (S N \u2212 \u039b3N )P (S N , \u039b3N ) with P a homogeneous polynomial of degree N \u2212 1\nwith a non\u2013zero coefficient of (S N )N\u22121 , whose precise form is unknown [2].\nFermi statistics requires attention in studying the quantum properties of S and its\npowers as these need to be defined by point splitting. Instanton calculations indicate that\none may obtain a well defined field constructed out of S. For SU (N ) one obtains (see [9]\nfor a recent discussion)\nhS N i = \u039b3N .\n(6)\n1\n\n\fThis result needs to be specified. There are two ways to calculate the gluino condensate.\nOne is based on the weak\u2013coupling instanton (WCI) calculations, giving the above result,\nwhereas with the strong\u2013coupling instanton (SCI) calculations the right hand side of (6) is\nreplaced by 2[(N \u2212 1)!(3N \u2212 1)]\u22121/N \u039b3N . However, it turns out that cluster decomposition\ndoes not hold in the SCI [10]. Furthermore, it has been observed that on R3 \u00d7S 1 the results\ndo not depend on the radius of S 1 , so that one ends up with R4 in the infinite radius limit,\n.\nor more precisely R3 \u00d7 R\u0302, where R\u0302 = R \u222a {\u221e} is the one point compactification of R. It is\ninteresting to note that, in the case of N = 2, it has been shown that the instanton moduli\nspace admits a compactification induced by the noncommutative theory. This property is\nintrinsic to N = 2, and so, even if the field content in the strong coupling region has not\nemerged yet, it should have a counterpart in a field theoretic derivation of the expansion of\nthe dual SW prepotential FD near the critical points u = \u00b1\u039b2SW . On the other hand, this\nregion is the one where breaking the N = 2 theory one obtains the N = 1 result (6). This\nwould suggest that the equivalence between the calculation of the gluino condensate in R4 ,\nmade by the WCI calculations, and the evaluation of the gluino condensate in R3 \u00d7 S 1 ,\nmay be connected with the compactification, induced by noncommutative geometry, of the\ninstanton moduli spaces in N = 2. In this respect, it is worth recalling that in the infrared\nregime low\u2013energy dynamics of noncommutative N = 2 supersymmetric U (N ) Yang\u2013Mills\ntheories, the U (1) decouples and the SU (N ) is described by the commutative SW theory\n[11].\nUsing the recursion relations for the instanton contributions, a Deligne\u2013Knudsen\u2013\nMumford (DKM) like compactification of instanton moduli space was derived in [12]. A\nremarkable property of the DKM stable compactification is a sort of regularization as\npunctures never collide in the degeneration limit. This is at the basis of the recursive\nstructure. It also turns out that, in a different approach, the existence of a nilpotent\nfermionic symmetry implies a BRST operator that leads to localization of integrals on the\ninstanton moduli spaces [13]. This is related to Nekrasov's project, formulated in a series\nof papers [14][15]. He and collaborators considered localization onto the instanton moduli\nspace, and introduced both the Q\u2013operator, which makes use of spacetime rotations in\naddition to the global gauge transformations, as well as the concept of the noncommutative\ninstantons. Remarkably, this culminated in [16], with the explicit evaluation, for any\nclassical gauge group, of the instanton moduli space integrals (see also [17][18]).\nThe above discussion naturally leads to consider nonperturbative configurations of\nN = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory on R3 \u00d7 R\u0302 rather than R4 . As argued by Witten [3],\nthis essentially avoids possible infrared divergences due to the fact that the calculations\nare performed by choosing a perturbative vacuum which is different from the true one.\nThis one\u2013point compactification can be seen as a way to impose boundary conditions on\nnonperturbative configurations rather than a change of topology of the space where the\n2\n\n\fgauge theory lives. This is of interest for the definition of the gluino condensate.\nWe also note that the point splitting is a quantum operation which leads to a modification of the classical operator definition. Even if this operation is sensible to UV physics,\nthe above remarks indicate that topological properties of the space\u2013time and the possible\nconnection to noncommutative geometry may lead to some UV/IR mixing related to the\nunderlying fermionic nature of the gaugino condensate. Moreover, there are some analogies\nbetween the matrix model formulation and the noncommutative theory.\nLet us go back to the analysis of the chiral ring. The above discussion shows that we\ncan use instanton results in order to define\n.\nO\u039b = S N \u2212 xlim\nhS(x1 ) . . . S(xN )i = S N \u2212 \u039b3N .\n(7)\n\u2192x\ni\nj\n\u2200ij\n\nNote that the X \u03b1\u0307 in (3) and (4) can differ only by a chiral operator: dimensional analysis\nand R\u2013symmetry forbid the existence of terms {Q\u03b1\u0307 , \u03b4X \u03b1\u0307 } that vanish as \u039b \u2192 0. The corN\nrection from Scl\nto S N concerns a redefinition of the glueball superfield and not {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 },\nthat is\nN\nScl\n= S N \u2212 \u039b3N .\n(8)\nTherefore, the basic observation is that it is the N \u2013th power of the glueball superfield that\nN\ngets quantum corrections. For these reasons we used the notation O\u039b in (7) instead of Scl\n.\n2\n\u03b1\u0307\nN\nHowever, since Scl = 0 was derived as an identity, and since, as we said, {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X } does\nnot receive quantum corrections, it follows by (1) and (3)\n{Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 }N = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nO\u039b = {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 },\n\n(10)\n\nN\nO\u039b\n= 0,\n\n(11)\n\nOn the other hand, being\nwe have\nthat is Eq.(2), as promised.\nWe conclude this note by observing that the emerging structure is reminiscent of the\nproperty of forms in a (N \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional space. To realize the similarity let us write\n.\n\u03c9 = {Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 },\n(12)\nwhere \u03c9 is a one\u2013form on a (N \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional space. Then\n{Q\u03b1\u0307 , X \u03b1\u0307 }N = \u2227N\nk=1 \u03c9 = 0,\n\n(13)\n\nleading to a structure which should be further investigated.\nAcknowledgements. It is pleasure to thank L. Alday, M.
