Due to the diamagnetic effects the energy\nin the magnetic fields cannot be less than a certain fraction of that in the relativistic particles and\nthen an upper limit on brightness temperature follows naturally. Since brightness temperatures do\nnot ever exceed the equipartition value \u223c 1011.5 K,\ninverse Compton effects do not even enter into picture.\nBut brightness temperatures much larger than\n1012 K have been inferred for the variable sources,\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe observed upper limit on the radio brightness temperatures of compact self-absorbed radio\nsources has till recently been thought to be an\n11.5\u221212\n< T\ninverse Compton limit Tb \u223c\nK\nic \u223c 10\n(Kellermann & Pauliny-Toth 1969). The argu>\nment is that at brightness temperature Tb \u223c\n12\n10 K energy losses of radiating electrons due to\ninverse Compton effects become so large that these\nresult in a rapid cooling of the system, thereby\nbringing the synchrotron brightness temperature\nquickly below this limit. However it has been\nshown (Singal 1986, 2009b) that it is the diamag-\n\n1\n\n\fviolating the incoherent brightness temperature\nlimit. This excess in brightness temperatures in\nthe case of centimetre variables has been explained\nin terms of a bulk relativistic motion of the emitting component (Rees 1966,1967; Woltjer 1966),\nwhile in the case of metre variables this excess is\nexplained in terms of slow interstellar scintillation\n(refraction) effects (Shapirovskaya 1982; Rickett\net al. 1984). The relativistic Doppler factors required to explain the excess in temperatures were\ninitially thought to be \u223c 5\u221210, similar to the ones\nrequired for explaining the superluminal velocities\nseen in some compact radio sources (Cohen et al.\n1971, 1977; Whitney et al. 1971). Singal & Gopalkrishna (1985) and Readhead (1994) pointed out\nthat under the conditions of equipartition of energy between magnetic fields and relativistic particles in a synchrotron radio source, much higher\nDoppler factors are needed to successfully explain\nthe variability events. However, the IDV implying temperatures up to \u223c 1019 K raises uncomfortable theoretical questions (Quirrenbach et al.\n1992; Wagner & Witzel 1995), as Doppler factors needed to explain observations seem too high\n(> 102 ). An attempt has been made to explain\nIDV by the interstellar scintillations (Wambsganss\net al. 1989). But close correlations between radio\nand optical variations seen in some cases rule out\nthat all the rapid radio variations are due to interstellar scattering (Wagner & Witzel 1995). One\nalternative could be the coherence emission models (see Benford & Lesch 1998 and the references\ntherein). High brightness temperatures for IDV's,\nlike in case of curvature radiation models proposed\nfor pulsars, could be achieved if bunches of nonthermal particles are somehow formed that radiate\nin phase giving rise to coherent synchrotron emission.\nIn this paper we show that there is a relation\nbetween the maximum possible brightness temperature and the gyro radii of radiating electrons and\nthat an upper limit on the maximum brightness\ntemperature is obtained for a self-absorbed incoherent synchrotron radio source from a limit on\nthe size of its gyro orbits. Even though it may\nappear to give a more conservative limit on the\nbrightness temperature as compared to the limit\nof \u223c 1012 K derived for Inverse Compton losses\nor due to the equipartition condition, all the same\nit is a more robust value as it involves no further\n\nassumptions about the source than just the applicability of the standard synchrotron theory.\nWe also show that, unlike in case of curvature radiation models proposed in pulsars, in the\nsynchrotron radiation mechanism the oppositely\ncharged particles would contribute together to the\ncoherent phenomenon without the need to form\nseparate bunches of opposite charges. However\nwe also show that bunches would get dispersed\nover dimensions larger than a wavelength in times\nmuch shorter than the gyro orbital period and that\na coherent emission by bunches cannot be a plausible explanation of the high brightness temperatures seen in extragalactic radio sources which\nshow variability over periods of a few hours or\nmore.\nUnless otherwise specified we have used cgs system of units throughout.\n2.\n\nGyro-orbit size and the brightness temperature limit\n\nA relativistic electron of rest mass m0 and a\nLorentz factor \u03b3, gyrating in a uniform magnetic\nfield B with a gyro frequency \u03bdg = \u03c9g /2\u03c0 =\ne B/(2\u03c0\u03b3m0 c), emits most of its radiation in a frequency band around its characteristic synchrotron\nfrequency given by (Rybicki & Lightman 1979),\n3 e B\u22a5 2\n3\n\u03bdg \u03b3 3 sin \u03b8 =\n\u03b3 \u2248 4.2 \u00d7 106 B\u22a5 \u03b3 2 .\n2\n4\u03c0 m0 c\n(1)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the magnetic field\nand the charge velocity while B\u22a5 = B sin \u03b8 is the\nperpendicular field component. Accordingly, with\nthe assumption that almost all the radiation from\nan electron is at a frequency \u03bd \u223c \u03bdc , we can write,\n\u03bdc =\n\n1\n\u03b3\u2248\n2 \u00d7 103\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bd\nB\u22a5\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nGyro radius of the relativistic electron's orbit is,\n\u03c1=\n\n3c 3\nc sin \u03b8\n=\n\u03b3 sin2 \u03b8,\n2\u03c0\u03bdg\n4\u03c0\u03bd\n\n(3)\n\nwhere equation (1) is used to express \u03bdg in terms\nof \u03bd.\n3\u03bb 3\n\u03b3 sin2 \u03b8.\n(4)\n\u03c1=\n4\u03c0\nHere \u03bb is the typical wavelength of radiation from\nan electron of Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n2\n\n\fparticles (Scheuer and Williams 1968; Altschuler\n< 2 \u00d7 109 \u03b3.\n1989), implying thereby, Tb \u223c\nNow from equations 4 and 8 we get the gyroorbit size as,\n\u0012\n\u00133\n3\u03bbm Tm\nsin2 \u03b8.\n(9)\n\u03c1m \u223c\n4\u03c0\n109\n\nAn expression for the maximum brightness temperature can be found from the detailed synchrotron theory. We assume the specific intensity I\u03bd has a usual power law in the optically thin\npart of the spectrum, i.e., I\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 or \u03bb\u03b1 , arising\nfrom a power law energy distribution of radiating\nelectrons N (E) = N0 E \u2212s , with s = 2\u03b1 + 1. For\ndefiniteness we shall assume s = 3, corresponding\nto spectral index \u03b1 = 1. For simplicity we also\nassume a uniform magnetic field B. But none of\nthe results derived here depend critically on these\nassumptions.\nThe maximum brightness temperature in the\nliterature is usually considered to be at the\nturnover point in the synchrotron spectrum where\nthe intensity peaks and that usually lies in the\noptically thin part of the spectrum (optical depth\n< 1). But as shown by Singal (2009a,b) peak\n\u03c4 \u223c\nof the brightness temperature actually lies deep\nwithin the optically thick region (\u03c4 \u223c 3).\nThe specific intensity in a synchrotron selfabsorbed source is given by,\n5/2\nI\u03bd = c\u22121\n(B\u22a5 )\u22121/2 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4 )],\n14 (s) \u03bd\n\nUsing average value of sin2 \u03b8 = 2/3, we can write,\n\u0012\n\u00133\nTm\n2\u03c0\u03c1m \u223c \u03bbm\n.\n(10)\n109\nThus an upper limit to the brightness temperature at an observing wavelength \u03bb can be found\nif the gyro-orbit size of the corresponding radiating electrons is constrained, e.g., from an upper\nlimit on the inferred size of the radiating source\ncomponent.\nNow if try to explain the observed radio variability data of AGNs in terms of purely an incoherent synchrotron radiation, we get some very unexpected results. For the IDV at GHz frequencies,\nthe inferred brightness temperatures turn out to\nbe Tb \u223c 1019 K (Quirrenbach et al. 1992), implying \u03c1 > 1028 cm, the size of the known universe.\nWe can understand it also like this. A brightness temperature Tb \u223c 1019 K could be achieved\nonly if the kinetic temperature of the radiating\nparticles exceeds this value, implying \u03b3 > 109 .\nAlso the relation between frequency and gyrofrequency \u03bd \u223c \u03bdg \u03b3 3 can be translated into that\nbetween wavelength and gyro-radius as \u03bb \u223c \u03c1 \u03b3 \u22123\nor \u03c1 \u223c \u03bb \u03b3 3 . Therefore for GHz frequencies\n(\u03bb \u223c 10 cm) we get \u03c1 > 1028 cm. The source\nsize on the other hand cannot be much larger than\n\u223c 1014.5\u221215 cm from the causality arguments for\nthese variability events, and thus their gyro-orbit\nsizes also cannot exceed this value (a part cannot\nbe larger than the whole!). This fact alone makes\nit imperative that some extraneous factor like relativistic beaming or interstellar refraction or some\ncoherent phenomena are invoked to explain these\nhigh brightness temperatures.\nFrom the size limits of \u223c 1014.5\u221215 cm on the\ndiameter of the gyro orbit, we immediately get\na gyro limit on the brightness temperature Tg \u223c\n1013.5 K (equation 10). This gyro temperature\nlimit is arrived at using just the applicability of the\nstandard synchrotron theory, without any a-priori\nassumption about the equipartition conditions in\n\n(5)\n\nwhere c14 (s) values are tabulated in Pacholczyk\n(1970).\nUsing Rayleigh-Jeans law for the specific intensity,\nI\u03bd =\n\n2 k T \u03bd2\n= 3 \u00d7 10\u221237 T \u03bd 2 ,\nc2\n\n(6)\n\nwe can determine the maximum brightness temperature (for s = 3) from Singal (2009a,b) as\nTm \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 106\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bdm\nB\u22a5\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nUsing equation 2 we can write Tm in terms of\nthe typical Lorentz factor \u03b3m of the electrons radiating at the maximum brightness temperature\nas\nTm \u2248 109 \u03b3m ,\n(8)\nwhich is in conformity with the fact that in an incoherent emission, where relativistic particles radiate independently of each other, thermodynamics constrains the brightness temperature Tb to be\n< kT /3 where k = 1.38 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg/deg\nkTb \u223c\ne\nis Boltzmann constant and Te = \u03b3 m0 c2 /k =\n5.93 \u00d7 109 \u03b3 is kinetic temperature of the radiating\n3\n\n\fthe source or even the inverse Compton effects.\nEven in the static compact synchrotron sources,\nwhere no variability is observed, the gyro-orbit diameter has to be still smaller than the observed\nsource size. Actually the gyro-orbit diameter will\nhave to be very much smaller than the observed\nsource size. It is not just a question of \"a part being not larger than the whole\", in order to apply\nthe self-absorbed synchrotron theory, one has to\nassume a large number of synchrotron orbits along\nthe line of sight within the total source extent, for\nthe optical depth to exceed unity. Therefore the\ntypical gyro orbit has to be perhaps many orders\nof magnitude smaller than the total source extent,\nand the gyro temperature limit Tg will then move\nclose to \u223c 1012 K.\nThe arguments usually offered in the literature against very high Tb values are based on the\ninverse Compton catastrophe where an incoherent synchrotron source cannot sustain these for\nlong as the extremely large inverse Compton losses\nwould very rapidly bring them to the incoherent brightness temperature limit. But from the\ngyro-size arguments we can say that an incoherent synchrotron source in the first place could not\nhave ever achieved such extremely high brightness\ntemperatures. Even though the derived temperatures limits may appear somewhat conservative\nthan those derived from Inverse Compton effects\nor the equipartition conditions, but the values derived here much more robust as these involve no\nfurther assumptions about the source than just the\napplicability of the standard synchrotron theory.\n3.\n\nof the number density of particles in the source,\nby noting that near the spectral turnover, where\nTb \u223c 1011.5 K, there is an equipartition of energy between particles and magnetic fields (Singal 1986, 2009b). Also this is the region where\nthe energy density of photons, Wp , approaches\nthat of magnetic fields (Kellermann & PaulinyToth 1969). We can estimate Wp as,\nZ\n4\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n3\nWp =\n. (11)\nIm \u03bdm = 3 kTm \u03bdm\nI\u03bd d\u03bd \u2248\nc\nc\nc\nThus one can get the number density of radiating\ncharges N mc2 \u03b3 \u2248 Wp \u2248 8\u03c0kTm/\u03bb3m , and with\n3kTm \u223c kTe = mc2 \u03b3, we get N \u223c 8\u03c0/3\u03bb3m . For\n\u03bdm \u223c 1 GHz, we get a typical number density\n\u223c 10\u22124 to 10\u22123 cm\u22123 .\n4.\n\nImplausibility of coherent emission by\nbunches in synchrotron radio sources\n\nIt has been shown that synchrotron radiation\nprocess does not allow MASER type coherent\nemission (Pacholczyk 1970; Rybicki & Lightman\n1979). Alternate coherence emission models have\nbeen proposed in the literature (Cocke & Pacholczyk 1975; Cocke et al. 1978; Colgate & Petschek\n1978; Benford & Lesch 1998 and the references\ntherein). Coherent emission could be achieved\nif bunches of non-thermal particles are somehow\nformed, which radiate in phase through antenna\nmechanism. As an example, in the case of pulsar\nmagnetosphere there are models of curvature radiation where coherence emission by bunches has\nbeen proposed to explain extremely high brightness temperatures observed in pulsars. Could similar models succeed in the case of synchrotron radiation in IDV's?\nNow in an overall neutral plasma there may be\noppositely charged particles, e.g., a pair plasma\ncomprising electrons and positrons. The contributions of electrons and positrons are indistinguishable in incoherent synchrotron cases. However,\nit is important to know if opposite charges occupying the same phase space cancel each other's\ncontribution to the synchrotron radiation? In the\npulsar models, electrons and positrons can cancel\neach others radiation fields. The biggest hurdle\nin those models is to form stable bunches of sizes\nless than a wavelength for each type of charges,\nwith bunches of opposite charges separated from\n\nEstimates of gyro-orbit sizes, number\ndensities and other parameters in compact synchrotron sources\n\nWe can reverse the roles and employ the observed maximum Tb values along with equations 7,\n8 and 10 to estimate gyro-orbit sizes and some typical numbers inside compact synchrotron sources.\nFor the brightness temperature seen in VLBI ob< 1011.5 K (Kellermann & Paulinyservations, Tb \u223c\nToth 1969). Then we get a gyro radius \u03c1 \u223c 108.5\n< 0.1 sec,\ncm, implying a gyro orbital period T \u223c\nfor the electrons radiating near the turnover frequency \u03bd \u223c 109 Hz. This gives \u03b3 \u223c 102.5 and\nB \u223c 10\u22122.5 Gauss.\nWe can make an order of magnitude estimate\n\n4\n\n\feach other by more than a wavelength (Melrose\n1992). Not only such bunches of the like-charges\nmay be unstable but strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged bunches tends to\nhinder the formation of such bunches. But it turns\nout that in the synchrotron case one need not separate the positive and negative charges in an overall\nneutral plasma. The radiation fields of electrons\nand positrons lying in the same phase space do not\ncancel each other.\nThe radiation field for a moving charge, derived\nfrom the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, is given by\n(Jackson 1975),\nE=\n\ne n \u00d7 {(n \u2212 \u03b2) \u00d7 \u03b2\u0307}\n.\nc\nR(1 \u2212 \u03b2.n)3\n\nIn a synchrotron source, all electrons gyrate in\na clock-wise fashion (looking along the magnetic\nfield vector). Now radiation at an observational\nfrequency \u03bd arises mostly from electrons with \u03b3\ngiven by equation 2 and the radiated power lies in\na cone of opening angle \u223c 1/\u03b3. Thus only charges\ncontributing effectively to the radiation at any instant are the ones that are moving within a narrow\nangle \u03c8 \u223c 1/\u03b3 with respect to the line of sight to\nthe observer.\nDuring every gyration cycle an electron radiates towards the observer for a time interval\n\u223c 2/(\u03c9g \u03b3 sin \u03b8), but due to Doppler effect, the\nradiation to the observer appears as a pulse of\nduration \u2206t \u223c 1/(\u03c9g \u03b3 3 sin \u03b8) \u223c 1/\u03c9c (Rybicki &\nLightman 1979). Then the pulse width in space\nwill be of length \u223c \u03bb and the average electric\nfield stronger by a factor \u223c \u03b3 3 within the pulse\nwindow than without. Thus two electrons moving towards the observer with a projected distance\nd apart will have their pulses arriving at the observer separated by a time interval \u223c d/c. Thus\nthe pulse windows will overlap, with the Fourier\ncomponents adding in phase, only if the electrons\nare less than a projected distance \u03bb of each other.\nHowever if the two charges are separated by a distance more than \u03bb then there will not be any overlap in their main pulse windows, and their fields\nwill not add in phase. Thus for a coherence to\noccur, the charges have to form a bunch lying\nwithin a region of length \u223c \u03bb along the line of\nsight and thereby radiating in phase towards the\nobserver. The lateral width W of the coherence\nvolume for charges radiating in a cone of opening\nangle \u03c8 \u223c 1/\u03b3, can be calculated from the condition W \u03c8 \u223c \u03bb or W \u223c \u03b3\u03bb, which gives a lateral\ncross-section \u223c \u03c0\u03b3 2 \u03bb2 . The coherence volume will\nbe in the shape of a chapati 1 , with a thickness \u03bb\nand a lateral cross-section \u03c0\u03b3 2 \u03bb2 . This gives us a\ntotal coherence volume Vc \u223c \u03c0\u03b3 2 \u03bb3 . A somewhat\nmore rigorous approach yields Vc \u223c \u03b3 2 \u03bb3 /\u03c0 (Melrose 1992). Thus for coherence emission to take\nplace there has to be a bunch of charged particles\nin the coherence volume, and for every gyro period\nT this bunch will radiate towards the observer coherently for a time \u223c T /\u03b3 3 .\nIt should be noted that an electron and positron\npair emitting coherently is not co-located with\n\n(12)\n\nEquation 12 can be derived also from first principles using Coulomb's law and the Lorentz transformations including relativistic Doppler factors\n(Singal 2011), without going through Li\u00e9nardWiechert potentials. In the case of gyration in\na magnetic field B, the acceleration is given by\nmc\u03b2\u0307\u03b3 = e\u03b2 \u00d7 B, from which we get,\nE=\n\ne2 n \u00d7 {(n \u2212 \u03b2) \u00d7 (\u03b2 \u00d7 B)}\n,\nmc2 \u03b3\nR(1 \u2212 \u03b2.n)3\n\nwhich is independent of the sign of the charge.\nThus charges of opposite sign lying in the same\nphase space, i.e. moving together with the same\nvelocity \u03b2, will have opposite acceleration vectors\nin the magnetic field B and consequently give rise\nto similar electric fields at the observer towards direction n. The radiation fields from electrons and\npositrons within a bunch will augment each other,\nand bunches of oppositely charged particles separated from each other by more than a wavelength\nare not necessary for coherence purpose. In the\ncase of curvature radiation models, both type of\ncharges undergo similar acceleration as they follow\nthe curvature of the magnetic field lines and their\nradiation fields, being in opposite directions, get\ncancelled. But in the synchrotron case the accelerations are of opposite signs, resulting in electric\nfields being in the same direction even from opposite charges. Thus a very big hurdle, viz. forming\nand maintaining separate bunches of oppositely\ncharged particles, faced in the curvature radiation\nmodels, can be avoided in the coherence emission\nmodels in the synchrotron case.\n\n1A\n\n5\n\nthin flat circular unleavened Indian bread\n\n\fT . As cT = 2\u03c0\u03c1 \u2248 \u03bb\u03b3 3 (equation 3, with average\nvalue of sin2 \u03b8 = 2/3), it means \u2206x \u2248 \u03bb\u03b3 2 \u2206\u03b3.\nIt can be written in terms of the velocity dispersion \u2206\u03b2, as for relativistic particles (\u03b2 \u223c 1),\n\u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3 3 \u2206\u03b2. Thus due to dispersion \u2206\u03b2 in velocity of the charges within the bunch, their gyroorbit sizes also have a dispersion \u2206x \u2248 \u03bb\u03b3 5 \u2206\u03b2. As\nfor the relativistic particles emitting synchrotron\nemission, \u03b3 \u226b 1, we see that just within a gyro\norbital period a bunch will get spread over regions\nlarger than \u03bb, even for \u2206\u03b2 as low as 10\u221212 , i.e.,\nfor velocity dispersion of the order only a fraction\nof a mm/sec.\nNormally a bunch with a velocity dispersion\n\u2206\u03b2 would get spread over a region ct\u2206\u03b2 in a\ntime period t and for the coherence to be effective, particles in a bunch should remain confined\nto within a wavelength \u03bb which would require that\n< \u03bb. Now there will be t/T gyro orbits\nthat ct\u2206\u03b2 \u223c\nin time t, so from equation 13 a bunch will get\nspread over a region ct\u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 = ct\u2206\u03b2\u03b3 2 in time\nt. Thus due to the difference in gyro-orbit periods the bunch would get spread over a region\nlarger by a factor \u03b3 2 than due to just dispersion\n\u2206\u03b2 in velocity. Or in other words a bunch will\nget spread over the region ct\u2206\u03b2 in a much shorter\ntime t/\u03b3 2 . Effectively any such bunch, even if\nsomehow formed, will get dispersed over regions\nlarger than a wavelength in a gyro orbital period\n< 0.1 sec, thus altogether destroying or at least\nT \u223c\nlargely diminishing the coherence capability of the\nbunch within fraction of a second. Thus even if\ncoherent emission due to bunches does give rise\nto high brightness temperatures, the bunches will\n< 0.1 sec) and\nget dispersed in a very short time (\u223c\nthe emission will drop on a similar time scale, not\nwhat is actually observed. In other words even if\ntheoretical models based on coherent synchrotron\nemission by bunches could achieve extremely high\nbrightness temperatures seen in IDV's, this high\nbrightness will be short-lived by many orders of\nmagnitude than what actual observations show\nand it looks quite implausible that coherent emission by bunches could consistently account for the\nobserved variability time scales of a few hours or\nmore.\nSince the flux-density variability could be a substantial fraction of the total flux-density of the\nsource, it is essential that there will have to be\nlarge number of bunches spread over the source\n\nconcentric gyro orbits, since while spiraling in opposite sense, whenever the pair crosses each other,\ntheir velocity vectors will be pointing in opposite\ndirections and the two will never be in the same\nphase space. For coherence emission, both type of\ncharges must be at the some location, having similar velocity vectors, and thus radiating in the same\ndirection (Like two circles touching each other externally with a common tangent). Now pairs of\nsuch bunches of oppositely charged particles, will\neach radiate towards the observer for a short duration \u223c T /\u03b3 3 ), and after spiraling in opposite\ndirections will again come together after the gyro\nperiod T , radiating in the same direction and thus\nbecoming part of the same bunch radiating coherently as far as the observer is concerned.\nA bunch of charges may radiate coherently only\nas long as the bunch stays together within dimensions less than a wavelength. In that case the observed coherent emission could attain brightness\ntemperatures much above the theoretical limit for\nthe incoherent synchrotron emission. The coherent emission will last as long as the bunch survives.\nBut as we discuss below there are serious difficulties with the stability of the bunches. The bunches\nare too short-lived and that their coherent emission at most may last over time intervals only of\n< 0.1 sec, Secthe order of a gyro-orbit period T (\u223c\ntion 3). On the other hand the variable extragalactic sources show IDV periods of a few hours. Any\ncoherence phenomenon to explain these variabilities, must also last over similar time scales. However, as we argue below, a bunch, where a number\nof charges moving together occupy a region smaller\nthan a wavelength, cannot be a stable configuration over such time scales in a synchrotron case.\nA tiny velocity dispersion, implying small\nspread in Lorentz factor \u03b3, would make the\nbunch disperse in a time interval much smaller\nthan the gyro-orbit period. The gyro frequency\n\u03bdg = e B/(2\u03c0\u03b3m0 c) is inversely proportional to \u03b3.\nThen two charges with a difference \u2206\u03b3 in Lorentz\nfactors will differ in their gyro period T by,\n\u2206\u03b3\n\u2206\u03bdg\n\u2206T\n=\n=\u2212\n.\nT\n\u03bdg\n\u03b3\n\n(13)\n\nThus two charges, starting from the same location,\nwill be about a distance \u2206x = c\u2206T apart after one\ngyro orbit. This will result in charges in a bunch\ngetting spread over regions \u2206x = cT \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 in time\n6\n\n\fextent. Above discussion is applicable to each and\nevery bunch and thus to the sum total of their\nemission in the whole source. Of course different\nbunches will be randomly located with respect to\neach other and thus would not be in phase with\neach other, so coherence between various bunches\nis not expected in any case. Could it be that there\nwere formation of new bunches in succession in\nresponse to, say, some local instability, and which\ncould then account for longer time scales of the observed variability? Actually each of these bunches\nwill last for a short time interval and their statistical addition will still have the primary time\nscale of the individual bunches. Consider for example a variability event where the flux-density\nreaches some peak value before declining on the\ntime scale of hours. All the bunches that may\nbe contributing to the peak flux-density would get\ndispersed very fast and the flux-density too would\nthen decline equally fast. Only in a very contrived\nsituation will the individual bunches follow each\nother so systematically that the resultant variability curve will have smooth shape lasting for many\norder of magnitude larger than that of the individual bunch time scale. In general the variability\ncurves will show the sharp time scales of bunches.\nOf course all electrons in certain region might not\nbe contributing to the bunch, but then the coherence emission will be proportional to the square\nof the number of bunched electrons only and for\nwhich the survival of the bunches is necessary for\na lasting coherent emission. One could envisage\na combination of coherence and relativistic beaming, but if the dominant emission is due to coherence then all the difficulties discussed above would\nremain still valid.\n5.\n\nabout the source than just the applicability of the\nstandard synchrotron theory. We have also shown\nthat, unlike in case of curvature radiation models\nproposed in pulsars, in the synchrotron radiation\nmechanism the oppositely charged particles lying\nin the same phase space would contribute together\nto the coherent phenomenon without the need to\nform separate bunches for particles with opposite charges. However we have also shown that\nbunches are short-lived and get dispersed over dimensions larger than a wavelength in times shorter\nthan the gyro orbital period. Thus even if theoretically a coherent emission by bunches could attain\nhigh brightness temperatures seen in extragalactic\nradio sources, still it cannot be a plausible explanation of the observed variability which lasts over\nperiods of a few hours or more.\nREFERENCES\nAltschuler, D.
