In SED the statistical character of quantum measurements\nis imitated by the introduction of a stochastic classical background electromagnetic field.\nRandom electromagnetic fluctuations are assumed to provide perturbations which can mimic\ncertain quantum phenomena while retaining a purely classical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the\nVan-der-Waals force, the Lamb shift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of a quantummechanical harmonic oscillator, and the radius of the Bohr atom.\n\nThis classical ZPF is\n\nrepresented as a homogeneous, isotropic ensemble of plane electromagnetic waves whose\namplitude is exactly equivalent to an excitation energy of h\u03bd/2 of the corresponding quantized\nharmonic oscillator, this being the state of zero excitation of such an oscillator. There is thus no\nrandomness in the classical electric field amplitudes: Randomness is introduced entirely in the\nphases of the waves, which are normally distributed. Averaging over the random phases is\nassumed to be equivalent to taking the ground-state expectation values of the corresponding\nquantum operator. We demonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics\nof the classical ZPF in contrast to that of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. Starting with a\ngeneral technique for the calculation of classical probability distributions for quantum state\noperators, we derive the distribution for the individual modes of the electric field amplitude in\nthe ground-state as predicted by quantum field theory (QFT). We carry out the same calculation\nfor the classical ZPF analogue, and show that the distributions are only in approximate\nagreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We then introduce an alternative\nclassical ZPF with a different stochastic character, and demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce\nthe statistics of the electromagnetic vacuum of QED. Incorporating this field into SED, it is\nshown that the full probability distribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a quantummechanical harmonic oscillator can be derived within a classical framework. This should lead to\nthe possibility of developing further successful correspondences between SED and QED.\n\n2\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\nThe research program known as random or stochastic electrodynamics (SED) is clearly\ndescribed in the classic review article by Boyer [1] and in the recent monograph of Milonni [2].\nSED is basically a modern extension of the classical electron theory of Lorentz and a follow-on\nto investigations of Planck [3], Nernst [4] and Einstein and Stern [5], but with a different choice\nof boundary conditions consistent with relativity; the boundary conditions being discussed in\ndetail by Boyer [1]. The uniform, homogeneous zero-point field (ZPF) forming the basis of SED\ntoday has a Lorentz-invariant radiation spectrum, i.e. the energy density scales as \u03c1(\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd3.\nPlanck's constant, h, appears in the electromagnetic field strength but only in the role of a scale\nfactor. In the classical SED view, quantum fluctuations are equivalent to electromagnetic ZPF\nperturbations, and thus the strength of the electromagnetic field must involve h; however\nwhereas in the quantum view h is a unit of quantization, in the SED view h is merely a measure\nof field strength. The primary emphasis of this research program has been to determine to what\nextent classical physics plus a ZPF can reproduce the results of quantum mechanics (QM) and\nquantum electrodynamics (QED).\nSeveral interesting classical re-workings of quantum problems have been published. For\nexample, it has been shown by Boyer [6] that the blackbody spectrum can be derived in this\nfashion without recourse to quantum assumptions. Inherent discontinuity in available energy\nstates is not required in this approach since the same net effect is produced on an ideal oscillator\nby the random fluctuations of the ZPF. Another classical problem, the stability of the Bohr\natom, similarly has a different resolution from the perspective of SED. A classically orbiting\nelectron in the sense of the Rutherford planetary model of 1913 would pick up energy from the\nZPF at a rate exactly balancing the radiative losses due to accelerated motions of the charged\nelectron [1][7].\n\nThis balance has been demonstrated only for the ground-state of the Bohr\n\nhydrogen atom.\nAs intriguing as these and other quantum re-derivations are, a fundamental objection to\nthe overall approach of SED is that if the ZPF is regarded as a real electromagnetic field, that\nwould have unacceptable gravitational consequences since the energy density would presumably\ngive rise to a physically unrealistic cosmological constant. Recent SED studies address this\nproblem and, building on a conjecture of Sakharov [8], find a possible interpretation of\ngravitation and inertia as themselves ZPF-mediated phenomena [9][10], analogous to the view of\n3\n\n\fZPF-mediated quantum phenomena. Some support for the possibility of non-gravitating vacuum\nenergy has recently been proposed by Dutta [11]. Nevertheless, the SED concepts have met with\njustifiable skepticism given the limitations of SED vis-\u00e0-vis modern quantum theory. We address\none such limitation in this paper.\nWhile SED is suggestive of interesting physics, given the resounding success of quantum\ntheory as a predictive description of nature, it will be necessary to demonstrate a far more\ndetailed correspondence of SED with QFT. Indeed, we have identified a discrepancy between\nSED as presently formulated and QFT in that the ZPF is assumed to consist of electromagnetic\nfields that are perfectly random in phase but with a known amplitude, which differs from the\ndistribution for the individual modes of the electric field amplitude in the ground-state as\npredicted by QFT. We introduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic\ncharacter, and demonstrate that it exactly reproduces the statistics of the electromagnetic vacuum\nof QED. Incorporating this field into SED, it will be shown that the full probability distribution\nfor the amplitude of the ground-state of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator can be\nderived within a classical framework.\nOur approach is as follows. In section II we present an elementary illustration of the\nproblem under consideration. In section III we first introduce some notation leading to a\ndefinition of an equivalent classical probability distribution for a quantum state operator. Then\nwe derive the ground-state probability distributions for the full electric field and a single mode of\nthe electric field consistent with QFT. In section IV SED distributions for each of these are\ncomputed and compared with those of QFT. In section V the computation and comparison is\nrepeated using our modified SED. We then apply the modified SED field to determination of the\nprobability distribution for the position of a classical harmonic oscillator and compare with the\nstandard quantum mechanical result, demonstrating precise agreement. This modification of the\nstandard SED approach should clear the way for further development of correspondences with\nQFT.\nII. CLASSICAL VS. QUANTUM SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR\nThe discrepancy between SED and QFT that we seek to address can be illustrated by\nexamining a simple harmonic oscillator (cf. Davies and Betts [12]). For a mass m, on a spring\n\n4\n\n\fwith force constant K, the frequency of oscillation will be \u03c9 =\n\nK m and the position x(t) can\n\nbe expressed as\n\nx(t ) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude. The probability of finding the mass within an interval dx at position x\nis p(x)dx, and this is equal to the fraction of time dt that is spent in that interval over half a\nperiod. From Eq. (1) we readily determine that\nd x = \u03c9A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6 ) d t = \u03c9 A 2 \u2212 x 2 d t\n\n(2)\n\nresulting in the classical probability distribution\np c ( x) =\n\n1\n\n1\n; x 2 \u2264 A2\n2\n2\n2E\n\u03c0 A \u2212x\n\u2212 x2\n\u03c0\n2\nm\u03c9\n=0\n; x 2 > A2\n=\n\nwhere we make use of the energy relation E =\n\n(3)\n\n1\nm\u03c9 2 A 2 .\n2\n\nThe quantum situation is radically different. In place of Newton's equation of motion one\nuses the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the same potential. One now finds discrete energy levels\nE n = (n + 21 ) =\u03c9 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe probability distribution for an oscillator in the nth excited state is\np n ( x) =\n\n\u03b1\n\u03c0 2 n!\nn\n\nH n2 (\u03b1x ) exp( \u2212\u03b1 2 x 2 )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere H n (\u03b1x ) are the Hermite polynomials, and the scale factor \u03b1 is\n\n\u03b1=\n\nm\u03c9\n.\n=\n\n(6)\n\nFor illustration we choose a quantum state excited to n=12 and compare p 12 ( x ) to the classical\nprobability pc(x). The amplitude of the latter has been set to unity by setting\nE n = 21 m\u03c9 2 = (n + 21 ) =\u03c9\n\n(7)\n\nwhich results in \u03b1=5 for n=12. These classical vs. quantum probability distributions are\nillustrated in Figure 1a. Classically, the mass spends more time near the extrema of the\noscillation, where the velocity approaches zero, than at the center where the velocity is maximal.\n\n5\n\n\fFor this degree of excitation, the quantum probability distribution oscillates around the classical\ndistribution, and begins to approximate it in the mean.\nThe quantum zero-point state probability distribution is described by Eq. (5) with n=0,\nbut in this case the expression may be simplified to\np 0 ( x) =\n\nm\u03c9\nexp( \u2212 m\u03c9x 2 =) .\n\u03c0=\n\n(8)\n\nThe classical distribution meanwhile remains the same on rescaling the axis. The two\ndistributions are shown together in Figure 1b. They differ radically.\nAny single mode of oscillation of the electromagnetic field will have analogous behavior\nto this simple harmonic oscillator. In section III we investigate the probability distribution for the\nzero-point field of quantum field theory and show that it has the form of Eq. (8). In section IV\nwe verify that the Boyer classical representation of a single mode of the zero-point field has the\nform of Eq. (3), which is to be expected of a classical wave of definite amplitude (and therefore\nenergy) but with an indefinite phase.\nIII. QUANTUM FIELD THEORY FOR THE ZERO-POINT FIELD\nA. Classical Probability Distributions for Quantum State Operators\n\nWe begin with an investigation of the precise correspondence between the statistics of\nthe quantized radiation field, where the electric and magnetic fields are operators, and the\nstatistics of a classical electromagnetic field consisting of plane waves forming the basis of the\nSED approach. To this end consider the relationship between a classical probability distribution\nand the expectation of an arbitrary function of a quantum operator (cf. Dirac [12]). Let us define\n\nr\u0003 to be some vector operator on a state \u03c8 , so that the expectation value of some function f (r\u0003 )\nis \u03c8 f (r\u0003 ) \u03c8 . Provided that the components of the vector r\u0003 commute with one another, we may\nthen associate with the particular state \u03c8 a probability distribution (of a c-number r) p \u03c8 (r ) ,\n\nsay. The defining relation for this classical probability distribution is that the expectation value\nof an arbitrary function must be the same as that computed from quantum theory:\n\u03c8 f (r\u0003 ) \u03c8 = \u222b d M r p \u03c8 (r ) f(r )\n\n(9)\n\n6\n\n\fwhere M is the dimensionality of r. To determine p \u03c8 (r ) it is convenient to go via a generating\nfunction, g( s) say, which is a transform of p \u03c8 (r ) , and which can be computed directly from Eq.\n(9) if f(r ) = f(r; s) is identified with the transform kernel. Choosing the Fourier transform,\n\none has:\n\nf(r; s) = exp( \u2212is.r ) ,\n\n(10)\n\ng(s) = \u03c8 exp( \u2212is.r\u0003 ) \u03c8 .\n\n(11)\n\nOnce the generating function has been computed from Eq. (11), the inverse transform then gives\nthe required distribution:\np \u03c8 (r ) = (2\u03c0)\n\n\u2212M\n\n\u222bd\n\nM\n\ns g(s) exp(is.r ) .\n\n(12)\n\nIn this paper we are interested exclusively in the ground state of the EM field \u03c8 = 0 , the\ndistribution for which we denote simply by p 0 ( r ) = p( r ) .\n\nB. Probability Distribution for the Total Field\nThe electric field operator can be expanded in the photon number representation [14]\n2\n\nE\u0003 = \u2212i \u2211 \u2211 \u03b5 k, \u03bb\n\u03bb =1 k\n\n(\n\n=\u03c9\na\u0003 \u2020 exp( \u2212ik.r + i\u03c9t ) \u2212 a\u0003 exp(ik.r \u2212 i\u03c9t )\nk, \u03bb\n2\u03b5 0V k,\u03bb\n\n)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = ck, \u03b5 k , \u03bb is a unit vector, and \u03bb labels the two directions mutually orthogonal and\northogonal to the momentum k. Thus if each of the 3 Cartesian components of k can take N\nvalues, then the dimensionality of the representation space is 6N. In the following, unless \u03bb\nappears explicitly, sums and products involving k should be taken to include \u03bb. In this paper we\nrestrict our attention to the transverse components of the electric field, though the corresponding\nresults for the magnetic field easily follow. Since all cavity modes are independent, the state of\nthe total field can be written as the product of the individual modes (cf.

(20) and the coherent photon state, \u03b1 k say. This\ncan be written in terms of an operation on the ground state (cf. [14] sect. 4.11)\n\n\u03b1 k = exp(\u03b1 k a\u0003 k\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1 *k a\u0003 k ) 0 k\n\n(21)\n\nwhich permits Eq.

In the absence of a cutoff frequency the variance is infinite, and therefore the\ndistribution is effectively flat, each component of the polarization vector having an amplitude\nthat is equally likely to take any value.\n\nC. Zero-point Energy of the Quantum Field\nThe following is a brief example of how a quantum mechanical expectation value can be\nreplaced by a classical average. The expected value for the zero-point energy, assuming equal\ncontributions from the electric and magnetic field components is\n\u0003 \u0003 0 .\nE zp = \u03b5 0V 0 E.E\n\n(30)\n\nAccording to Eq.

(29), and performing the integrals, one obtains\nE zp = 3\u03b5 0V\u03c3 =\n2\nE\n\nV= \u222b d \u03c9 \u03c9 3\n2\u03c0 2 c 3\n\n(32)\n\n9\n\n\fwhich gives an energy density (per radian frequency, per unit volume)\n\u03c1(\u03c9 ) =\n\n=\u03c9 3\n2\u03c0 2c3\n\nwhich is the required (QFT) density corresponding to average energy\n\n(33)\n1\n2\n\n=\u03c9 per normal mode.\n\nD. Probability distribution of a single mode\nA distribution for the amplitude of each normal mode can be obtained by decomposing\nthe electric field operator into a sum of commuting normal mode operators\n\nE\u0003 = \u2211 \u03b5 k E\u0003 .\nk\n\nk\n\n(34)\n\nFollowing the same procedure as for the full field, it is straightforward to show that each normal\nmode amplitude is itself normally distributed:\np( E k ) =\n\n1\n2 \u03c0\u03c3\n\n2\n\nexp( \u2212 E k2 2\u03c3 2k ) .\n\n(35)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03c3 k is as defined in Eq. (19). This distribution for the amplitude of the electromagnetic\nfield modes is identical to that of the quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator of Eq. (8)\nas illustrated in Figure 1b. (for 21 m\u03c9 2 = \u03b5 0V ). In this case, as the space becomes unbounded, the\nvariance becomes vanishingly small, and the distribution approaches a delta function centered on\nan amplitude value of zero. However, the zpf energy in each mode, E k say, remains finite and\nindependent of the geometry:\n\nE k = \u03b5 0V \u222b d E k p( E k ) E k2 = 21 =\u03c9\n\n(36)\n\nas required.\n\nIV. BOYER'S CLASSICAL STOCHASTIC ZERO-POINT FIELD\nA. Introduction\nThe question we seek to address is whether it is possible to substitute a classical\nelectromagnetic field with some stochastic behavior for the zero-point field of QFT. Such a field\nwould be expected to correctly predict effects attributed to the zero point field, including\nspontaneous emission, Van-der-Waals forces, the Lamb shift, and Casimir forces. Boyer's\n10\n\n\fsuggestion [1] is a classical field which is a sum of Fourier k components of definite amplitude,\nbut random phase. Averaging over the phases then replaces the procedure of taking the groundstate expectation value of an operator involving the electromagnetic field.\nTo be consistent with the notation of this paper, we write the Boyer field as:\n\nE(r , t ) = 2 \u2211 \u03b5 k \u03c3 k cos(k . r \u2212 \u03c9t + \u03b8 k )\n\n(37)\n\nk\n\nwith the \u03b8 k independent and subject to a constant distribution in [0,2\u03c0]:\nexp(i\u03b8 k ,\u03bb \u2212 i\u03b8 k \u2032 ,\u03bb ) = \u03b4 k ,k \u2032\n\n(38)\n\nThat this is equivalent to the Boyer field of earlier publications can be shown by converting the\nsum to an integral (valid when the space is unbounded), which from Eq. (25) is\n\n\u2211\n\n\u2192\n\nk\n\n2\nV\n3\nd\n,\nk\n\u2211\n(2\u03c0)3 \u222b0\n\u03bb =1\n\n(39)\n\nand at the same time redefining the random variables so that\nexp(i\u03b8 k ,\u03bb \u2212 i\u03b8 k \u2032 ,\u03bb ) = \u03b4 (k \u2212 k \u2032)\u03b4 \u03bb ,\u03bb \u2032 .\n\n(40)\n\nApplying Eq. (39) to (37) gives the expression used in Boyer [1] (but in MKS units):\n2\n\nE(r , t ) = Re \u2211 \u222b d 3 k \u03b5 k\n\u03bb =1\n\n=\u03c9\nexp(ik . r \u2212 i\u03c9t + i\u03b8 k ) .\n8\u03c0 3 \u03b5 0\n\n(41)\n\nB. Distribution for the total field\nA requirement of the classical stochastic field is that it have the same distribution as the\nQFT zero-point field. The generating function for the distribution is defined in the normal way,\nbut now the expectation value implies an averaging over the phases:\ng(s) \u2261 exp( \u2212is.E)\n=\n=\n\n\uf8f1 1 2\u03c0\n\uf8fc\nd \u03b8 k exp \u2212 i 2\u03c3 k s. \u03b5 k cos( k . r \u2212 \u03c9t + \u03b8 k ) \uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\u220f\n\u222b\nk \uf8f3 2\u03c0 0\n\uf8fe\n\n(\n\n\u220f {J\nk\n\n0\n\n(\n\n2\u03c3 k s. \u03b5 k\n\n)\n\n(42)\n\n)}\n\nwhich is just the generating function for the sum of a set of independent classical harmonic\noscillators. In the limit that \u03c3 k is small (the volume is large), the Bessel functions are always\npositive, and it is safe to write:\n\n11\n\n\f( (\n\n\uf8eb\ng(s) = exp\uf8ec \u2211 log J 0\n\uf8ed k\n\n))\n\n\uf8f6\n2\u03c3 k s. \u03b5 k \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(43)\n\nThe generating function for the QFT distribution, Eq. (24), can be reproduced if only the first\ntwo terms are retained in the power series expansion of the Bessel function, and provided one\ncan then set log(1+ x ) \u2248 x for each term in the sum, whereupon\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ng(s) \u2248 exp\uf8ec \u2212 \u2211 |\u03b1 |2 2\uf8f7\nk\n\uf8ed k\n\uf8f8\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is defined in Eq. (18). The above result is valid in the limit that the volume is infinite,\nk\n\nbecause the sum over k supplies a volume which cancels with that in \u03b1 . It follows that higher\nk\n\norder terms (n>1) in the expansion of the Bessel and log functions must have dependencies on\nthe volume which go as V1-n. Therefore, when the volume is bounded (in any dimension, such as\nfor example by a Casimir cavity) then this classical distribution will differ from the QFT\ndistribution. (Note that within the QFT framework the generating function Eq. (24) is exact,\nregardless of the volume of the space supporting the field modes.)\nC. Distribution for a single mode\nThe disagreement between QFT and the Boyer field is more acute for a single mode. The\nQFT result is that each mode is independently normally distributed. The Boyer field components\nare also independent, but instead have the distribution of a classical harmonic oscillator, i.e. each\ncomponent of the expansion\nE = \u2211 \u03b5 k Ek\n\n(45)\n\nk\n\nhas the distribution given in Eq. (3), which in the notation of this section is\np( E k ) =\n\n1\n\u03c0 \u03c3 \u2212E\n\n=0\n\n2\nk\n\n2\nk\n\nE k2 \u2264 \u03c3 k2\nE >\u03c3\n2\nk\n\n(46)\n\n2\nk\n\nComparison with the QFT result Eq. (35) will show that the first and second moments are the\nsame, but beyond that the distributions diverge widely. The conclusion is that a classical field\nwith a random phase does not accurately reproduce the statistics of a QFT field operator on the\nground-state.\n12\n\n\fV. A MODIFIED CLASSICAL ZERO-POINT FIELD\nA. Introduction\nAn alternative to the Boyer field is the following:\nE(r , t ) = Re \u2211 \u03b5 k \u03c3 k wk exp(ik.r \u2212 i\u03c9t )\n\n(47)\n\nk\n\nwhere wk = uk + ivk , and uk and vk are real, independent, normally distributed random\nvariables, having zero mean and unit variance. This field can alternatively be written:\nE(r , t ) = 2 \u2211 \u03b5 k \u03c3 k I k cos(k . r \u2212 \u03c9t + \u03b8 k )\n\n(48)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b8 k has a constant distribution in [0,2\u03c0], and I k has distribution:\np( I k ) = exp( \u2212 I k ) ;\n\nI k \u2208[0, \u221e] .\n\n(49)\n\ni.e. the intensity of each mode is exponentially distributed. Comparison of Eq. (48) with Eq. (37)\nindicates that one may regard this field as differing from the Boyer field by the introduction of a\nstochastic element for the amplitude of each mode. (The stochastic nature of this field can be\nviewed as an implementation of the Box-Muller method for generating normally distributed\nrandom deviates from a pair of uniformly distributed random deviates, c.f. [15].)\nB. Distribution of a single mode\nExpanding the field as in Eq. (37) it is seen that the amplitude Ek of each mode is a\nlinear combination of two independent zero mean unit normal deviates:\n\nEk = \u03c3 k ( uk cos(k.r \u2212 \u03c9t ) \u2212 vk sin(k.r \u2212 \u03c9t ) ) .\n\n(50)\n\nIt follows that Ek is itself normally distributed with variance\n\n[\n\n]\n\n< Ek2 >= \u03c3 k2 < uk2 > cos2 (k.r \u2212 \u03c9t ) + < vk2 > sin 2 (k.r \u2212 \u03c9t ) = \u03c3 k2\n\n(51)\n\nfrom which follows the required result that each component is distributed in accord with Eq.\n(35). Since the stochastic variables are defined to be independent, and since each mode of this\nfield has the same distribution as the modes of the QFT zero point field, it follows that the\ndistributions for the full fields also agree. The conclusion is that the field defined in Eq. (47) is\nthe correct classical analogue of the QFT zero point field.\n\n13\n\n\fC. Harmonic oscillator driven by a stochastic field\nStochastic electrodynamics attempts to use a stochastic but otherwise classical field to\npredict the motion of charged particles as given by quantum theory. A recent success has been\nthe prediction of the correct (RMS) radius for the ground-state of the Bohr atom by interpreting\nthe Boyer field as a forcing term on a classical harmonic oscillator [1]. That analysis is extended\nhere using the alternative classical zero-point field presented above to determine the full\nprobability distribution for the oscillator coordinate.\nUsing the notation of Puthoff [7], the equation of motion for a classical electron oscillator\ndriven by the zero-point field, including radiation damping, is:\n\n\u0005\u0005 + \u03bd 20 q \u2212 \u0393\u0005\u0005\u0005\nq\nq = \u0393 \u2032E\n\n(52)\n\nwhere q \u2261 q(t ) is the oscillator co-ordinate, \u03bd 0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator, and the\ndamping and driving coefficients are:\n\n\u0393 = e 2 / 6\u03c0\u03b5 0mec 3 , \u0393 \u2032 = e / me .\n\n(53)\n\nImplicit in Eq. (52) is that the velocities are non-relativistic, whence the field can be treated as if\nacting at a constant point, which for convenience is taken to be at r=0. Using the Fourier\ntransforms of the coordinate and the field, Eq. (52) can be written\n\nq(\u03bd ) = h(\u03bd )E(\u03bd )\nh(\u03bd ) \u2261\n\n\u0393\u2032\n.\n2\n3\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd + i\u0393\u03bd\n\n(54)\n\n2\n0\n\nThe Fourier transform of the field given by Eq. (47) (suppressing the argument r=0) is\n\n[\n\n]\n\nE(\u03bd ) = \u03c0 \u2211 \u03c3 k \u03b5 k \u03b4 (\u03c9 + \u03bd )( uk + ivk ) + \u03b4 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bd )( uk \u2212 ivk ) .\nk\n\n(55)\n\nSubstitution of Eq. (55) into the Fourier inverse of q(\u03bd ) (as given in Eq. (54)) gives\nq(t ) = \u222b d\u03bd exp(i\u03bdt ) h(\u03bd )E(\u03bd ) / 2\u03c0\n~\n= \u2211 \u03b5 k \u03c3 k Re wk h * (\u03c9 ) ,\nk\n\n{\n\n}\n\n(56)\n\n~\nh(\u03c9 ) \u2261 exp(i\u03c9t ) h(\u03c9 ).\nThe generating function for the distribution is\n\n14\n\n\fg(s) \u2261 exp( \u2212is.q)\n=\n\n\uf8f11\n\n\u220f \uf8f2\uf8f3 2\u03c0 \u222b d u \u222b d v\nk\n\nk\n\n=\n\n\u220f exp( \u2212 s. \u03b5\n\nk\n\n[\n\n2\n\nk\n\n(\n\n{\n\n}\n\n{\n\n})]\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe\n\n~\n~\nexp \u2212 uk2 /2 \u2212 v k2 /2 \u2212 is. \u03b5 k \u03c3 k uk Re h(\u03c9 ) + v k Im h(\u03c9 )\n\n)\n\n(57)\n\n\u03c3 k h(\u03c9 ) / 2 .\n\nk\n\nThis result is exact: no approximation based upon the geometry of the bounding space, and\ntherefore the mode density, has been made thus far. The generating function, and therefore the\ndistribution of the oscillator coordinate, can in principle be computed from the above for any set\nof modes associated with a given (finite) geometry. Stochastic electrodynamics therefore\npredicts a dependency of the oscillator amplitude on the geometry of the space supporting the\nzero point field. (It has not yet been shown if this dependency agrees with that of a quantumtheoretical model which takes into account the reflective properties of the confining walls on the\nharmonic potential.)\nIn an unbounded space the product may be converted into an integral of the exponent, as\nin the earlier analysis. Using Eqs. (25) and (26), one thereby obtains\n\u221e\n\uf8eb\ns2 =\n2\uf8f6\ng(s) = exp\uf8ec \u2212\nd \u03c9\u03c9 3 h(\u03c9 ) \uf8f7 .\n2 3\n\u222b\n\uf8ed 12 \u03c0 c \u03b5 0 0\n\uf8f8\n\n(58)\n\nUsing the resonance approximation [7], the integral is found to be\n\u221e\n\n3\n\u222b d \u03c9\u03c9 h(\u03c9 ) \u2248\n2\n\n0\n\n\u03c0(\u0393 \u2032 ) 2 3\u03c0 2 c 3\u03b5 0\n.\n=\n2\u0393\u03bd 0\nme\u03bd 0\n\n(59)\n\nInserting this result into Eq.

Correspondence with the Bohr atom\nThe Bohr atom (ground-state) can be considered as a pair of 1D harmonic oscillators\n[1,7], oscillating in quadrature in a plane. Confining the distribution Eq. (62) to 2 dimensions\ngives\n\n(\n\np(q x , q y ) = 2 \u03c0\u03c3\n\n)\n\n2 \u22121\nq\n\n\uf8eb q x2 + q y2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7.\nexp\uf8ec\uf8ec \u2212\n2\u03c3 2q \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n(63)\n\nfrom which the Bohr radius is predicted to be\n< r02 >=< q x2 + q y2 >= 2\u03c3 q2 =\n\n=\nme\u03bd 0\n\n(64)\n\nwhich is the required result according to quantum theory. No attempt is made here to replicate\nthe quantum-mechanical distribution of the radius for an atom in the ground-state because the\ncorrespondence between the classical and quantum models is incomplete. A fuller treatment\nrequires first a solution for the equation of motion for the position of a classical electron in a 1/r2\nforce-field including radiation damping and the force from a stochastic zero-point field.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\nSecond quantization of the electromagnetic field leads to a system of Schr\u00f6dinger type\nequations for the QFT 'wave-function' in a space whose coordinates are the amplitudes of the\nFourier expansion of the vector potential. The potential experienced by this wavefunction is the\nenergy associated with the amplitudes of the Fourier modes, i.e. is proportional to the square of\nthe amplitude. Thus each mode contributes a one-degree-of-freedom harmonic oscillator to the\ndynamics. It follows that the QFT wavefunction for a single mode is in general a super-position\nof the Hermite-Gauss functions of the Fourier amplitude, the ground-state of which is just the\nGaussian. Therefore the probability density for the amplitude of a mode when the system is in\nthe ground-state is also a Gaussian. It is not surprising therefore that the ground-state electric\nfield amplitude is also normally distributed, as shown in section III.\nIn section IV the Boyer field has been shown to replicate the distribution of the total field\nonly by virtue of the mean value theorem. The individual modes are not normally distributed, but\nconspire to give a normal distribution to the amplitude of the full field in the limit of an infinite\ndensity of k states. The deployment of the Boyer field as the SED driving force in a classical\n16\n\n\fharmonic oscillator succeeds in reproducing the correct RMS amplitude provided the linewidth\n(\u0393 in Eqs. (52) and (53)) is sufficiently broad - i.e. provided there are a sufficient number of field\nmodes within the bandwidth centered on the resonant frequency of the oscillator.\nThe modified stochastic character of the field introduced in section V does not suffer\nfrom this limitation. Rather, it has been shown that a classical EM field with a suitable stochastic\nbehavior not only reproduces the statistics of the zero-point field of Quantum Field Theory, but\nalso imposes the correct - quantum mechanical - distribution upon a classical harmonic oscillator\nembedded in such a field. However, the aim of this paper is not to simply provide a more\naccurate classical analogue for the zero-point field. Rather, we wish to draw attention to the\nconnection between the probability distributions of the stochastic variables in the classical field,\nand those of the Fourier amplitudes of the second quantized field theory. It is evident that in\norder to accurately reproduce QFT statistics, the classical field must borrow the appropriate\ndistributions from QFT. In future work we hope to show how this procedure can be carried\nfurther, and derive a classical field with a stochastic character that successfully imitates elevated\nand mixed states of the quantized field.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMichael Ibison gratefully acknowledges support from the McDonnell Foundation Inc. and the\nHuman Information Processing Group at Princeton University.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nT.H.
