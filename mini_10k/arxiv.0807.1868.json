Presently, QRs can be\nfabricated using a variety of techniques.1,2,3 The tunability of size, shape, and electron number in QRs suggests\napplications in the field of quantum-information technology. In particular, one can exploit the well-known\nAharonov-Bohm effect4 by external magnetic fields,5 or\ncontrol the electronic states by short laser pulses within\nthe decoherence time.6\nMany-electron QRs have been studied theoretically using various approaches, e.g., model Hamiltonians,7,8 exact diagonalization,9,10 quantum Monte Carlo,10,11 and\ndensity-functional theory12,13,14 (DFT). Within spinDFT (SDFT) or current-SDFT applied to QRs, the exchange and correlation energies and potentials are commonly calculated using the two-dimensional (2D) local spin-density approximation15 (LSDA). For relatively\nwide QRs, LSDA performs reasonably well,12,13 which is\nnot surprising in view of the good performance of the\nLSDA in the case of 2D quantum dots.16 However, in the\nquasi-one-dimensional limit the 2D-LSDA is expected to\nfail similarly to the breakdown of the three-dimensional\nLSDA in the quasi-2D limit.17 Hence, in order to benefit\nfrom the efficiency of DFT methods in various QRs, accurate density functionals for exchange and correlation are\nneeded. Methods based on exact-exchange (EXX) functionals seem an attractive possibility.18 However, most\ncomputational schemes exploting EXX for finite systems\nsuffer from numerical problems,18,19 which, ultimately,\nprevents the method from being applied to large electron\nnumbers.\nIn this paper we derive an accurate method to calculate the exchange-hole potential and the exchange energy of QRs. The resulting density functional is simpler than EXX, but yet compatible with correlation functionals based on the modeling of the correlation hole.20\nOur derivation follows the strategy originally proposed\nfor atoms by Becke and Roussel,21 in which the averaged\nexchange hole of a suitable single-electron wavefunction\nis adapted to a general N -electron system by examining\n\nthe short-range behavior of the exchange hole. Recently,\na similar approach has been used to develop exchange\nfunctionals for finite 2D systems,22 which can be reproduced as a special case of this work. In the numerical\nexamples we demonstrate the accuracy of the functional\nagainst exact-exchange results and underline the considerable improvement over the LSDA, particularly in the\nquasi-1D limit.\nIn the framework of SDFT the exact exchange energy\nfunctional of the spin densities \u03c1\u2191 (r) and \u03c1\u2193 (r) can be\nwritten in (effective) atomic units28 (a.u.) as\nZ\nZ\n1 X\n\u03c1\u03c3 (r1 ) \u03c3\nh (r1 , r2 ),\nEx [\u03c1\u2191 , \u03c1\u2193 ] = \u2212\ndr1 dr2\n2\n|r1 \u2212 r2 | x\n\u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nh\u03c3x (r1 , r2 )\n\n=\n\n|\n\nPN\u03c3\n\nk=1\n\n\u2217\n\u03c8k,\u03c3\n(r1 )\u03c8k,\u03c3 (r2 )|2\n\u03c1\u03c3 (r1 )\n\n(2)\n\nis the exchange-hole function. Here we assume that the\nnoninteracting ground state is nondegenerate and hence\ntakes the form of a single Slater determinant constructed\nfrom the KS orbitals, \u03c8k,\u03c3 .\nNext we look for an approximation for the cylindrical\naverage of the exchange hole. It is defined around r1 with\nrespect to s = r2 \u2212 r1 as22\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nh\u0304\u03c3x (r1 , s) =\nd\u03c6s h\u03c3x (r1 , r1 + s).\n(3)\n2\u03c0 0\nIn the following, we compute h\u0304\u03c3x exactly for a singleelectron wavefunction of a QR.

Therefore, we parametrize \u03b12 and r2\ninto functions of r by setting \u03b12 \u2192 a(r) and r2 \u2192 b(r).\nEquation (7) can be now rewritten as\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\naM +1 \u2212a(b+s2 )\ne\n(b + s2 )M\n=\n\u03c0M \u2217 !\n\u221a !k k\n\u0012 \u2217\u0013\nM\u2217\nX\n2 bs\nd\nk M\nI0 (z)\n\u00d7\n(\u22121)\nb + s2\ndz k\nk\n\nh\u0304\u03c3x (a, b; s)\ndescribed by the strongly peaked \"antidot\" [first term in\nV (r)], and, on the other hand, the edge of the QR is described by a soft, parabolic confinement [second term in\nV (r)]. In this tunable model, both the radius and width\nof the QR can be changed independently by varying M\nand \u03b1 (see below).\nThe eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a single electron\nconfined by V (r) in Eq. (4) can be solved analytically.23\nSetting the radial and angular quantum numbers to zero,\nn = m = 0, yields a wavefunction\n\u03b1M+1 M \u2212\u03b12 r2 /2\n\u03c8\u03c3 (r) = \u221a\nr e\n.\n\u03c0M !\n\nk=0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere M \u2217 = 2(\u2206r\u2217 /r0\u2217 )\u22122 is the nearest integer describing the characteristic ratio between the effective width\nand the radius of the N -electron QR. As we will show below, r0\u2217 and \u2206r\u2217 can be extracted from the spin density.\nAs a consequence, M \u2217 can be considered as a (spin) density functional M \u2217 [\u03c1\u03c3 ]. The short-range behavior with\nrespect to s can be obtained from the first two nonvanishing terms in the Taylor expansion in Eq. (3):\n\n(5)\n\nh\u0304\u03c3x (r, s) = \u03c1\u03c3 (r) + s2 Cx\u03c3 (r) + . . . ,\n\n(9)\n\n\"\n#\n2\nj2p,\u03c3\n1\n1 (\u2207\u03c1\u03c3 )\n2\n=\n\u2207 \u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03c4\u03c3 +\n,\n+2\n4\n2 \u03c1\u03c3\n\u03c1\u03c3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\nWe emphasize that this expression, normalized for each\n\u03b1, is the general single-electron ground-state wavefunction\n\u221a of a QR having a potential minimum at r = r0 =\nM /\u03b1, which corresponds to the ring radius. The width\n2\nof the single-electron QR having\n\u221a the energy E0 = \u03b1 can\nbe approximated by \u2206r = 2/\u03b1. In Fig. 1 we show\nexplicitly the relation between the single-electron radius\nand width of the QR (r0 , \u2206r) and the parameters (M, \u03b1)\nin the external confining potential given in Eq. (4).\nThe exact exchange-hole function for the singleelectron wavefunction in Eq.

(8).\n(5) Finally calculate the exchange-hole potential and\nthe exchange energy from Eqs. (14) and (15), respectively.\nNext we test the performance of our functional in a few\nexamples. As the reference results we use the exchangehole potentials and exchange energies of the EXX calculations within the rather accurate Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI)\napproximation.25 We compare the results also to the 2DLSDA. Both the EXX and LSDA results are obtained\nusing the octopus code.27 The converged EXX orbitals\nare used as the input KS orbitals in our functional (and\nin the LSDA). Alternatively, also the LSDA orbitals can\nbe used as input, which in most cases leads to only minor\nchanges in the results.\nFigure 2 shows the exchange-hole potentials for twoelectron singlet states of two QRs defined by (a)\n(M, \u03b1)=(1, 0.5) and (b) (M, \u03b1)=(9, 3), respectively. Note\nthat here we have set M \u2217 = M as the first approximation. In both cases we find excellent agreement between\nthe EXX (dashed lines) and the present work (solid lines).\nBoth the large-r limit, where Ux\u03c3 decays as \u22121/r, and also\nthe r \u2192 0 limit, are correctly reproduced.\nThe exchange energies per particle of the LSDA (dotted lines in Fig. 2), which are directly comparable to\n\n\u22120.2\n\nEXX\npresent\n\nLSDA\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.5\n0\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n4\n6\nr (a.u.)\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\nN=2\nS=0\n\nM=9\n\u03b1=3\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\nx\n\nU\u03c3 (a.u.)\n\nFrom Eqs.

The dashed\nline shows the exact-exchange (EXX) result, the solid line is\nthe result of the present work, and the dotted line corresponds\nto the exchange-energy density in the local spin-density approximation (LSDA).\n\nUx\u03c3 , deviate significantly from the EXX and from our\napproximation. The inability of the LSDA to yield the\ncorrect shape of the curve is due to the simple densitydependent expression of the exchange energy per particle\n1/2\nin the LSDA, i.e., \u01ebLSDA\n\u221d \u03c1\u03c3 , leading to differences\nx,\u03c3\nalso in the exchange energy. In the case of Fig. 2(a),\nwe find ExLSDA = \u22120.389, whereas ExEXX = \u22120.409 and\nExpresent = \u22120.408. When the ratio \u2206r/r0 is decreased\nto one third, i.e., M = 1 \u2192 9, the deviation of the LSDA\nbecomes more pronounced as shown in Fig. 2(b). Now\nwe find ExLSDA = \u22121.502 vs. ExEXX = Expresent = \u22121.300.\nIn other words, the above change in M increases the relative error of the LSDA exchange energy from 5% to 16%.\nHence, these results demonstrate the breakdown of the\n2D-LSDA in the quasi-one-dimensional limit.\nAt this point we make two remarks of the numerical\nprocedure. First, Eq. (13) has two solutions for y(r),\nfrom which we choose the smaller one for r < r[\u03c1max ]\nand the larger one otherwise. Since these two solutions\ndo not generally coincide at r = r[\u03c1max ], we extrapolate Ux\u03c3 (r) around this point as visualized in the inset of Fig. 2. This smoothing procedure is done such\nthat Ex is not altered. Second, the application of the\noverall scheme might be numerically cumbersome in the\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n0\n\nN=6\nS=3\n\nM=1\n\u03b1 = 0.5\n\nU\u03c3x (a.u.)\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\nEXX\nmodel\nLSDA\n\n\u22120.8\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nr (a.u.)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nN = 12\nS=0\n\nM=3\n\u03b1 = 0.5\n\nU\u03c3x (a.u.)\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\nEXX\nM* = M\nM* = 2\nLSDA\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.8\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nr (a.u.)\n\npolarized current-carrying six-electron QR at B = 6 T\nand for (b) a 12-electron QR. Similarly to the previous\nexamples, we find excellent agreement with the EXX.\nThe six-electron case yields ExEXX = \u22122.226, Expresent =\n\u22122.238, and ExLSDA = \u22122.114. In the case of 12 electrons, we plot results for both M \u2217 = M = 3 and for\nM \u2217 [\u03c1] = 2 \u2248 2(\u2206r\u2217 /r0\u2217 )\u22122 , where the effective radius r0\u2217\ncorresponds to the point where the cumulative density\nreaches 50 %, and the effective width \u2206r\u2217 , centered at\nr0\u2217 , covers 90 % of the total density. We find that in the\nlatter case the agreement with the EXX is better.\nTo conclude, we have derived, from first principles, an\naccurate and general approximation for the exchangehole potential and hence for the exchange energy in quantum rings. Excellent agreement with the exact-exchange\nresults is obtained regardless of the ring geometry, number of electrons, spin polarization, and currents. Moreover, we have demonstrated that, in contrast to the localdensity approximation, our functional can deal with the\nphysically relevant dimensional crossover between two\nand one dimensions. Our approach is suitable for the\ndevelopment of correlation functionals by considering the\nexact properties of the corresponding correlation-hole potentials.20\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Same as in Fig. 2 but for (a) a fully\nspin-polarized current-carrying six-electron quantum ring at\nB = 6 T and for (b) a zero-current 12-electron quantum ring.\n\nsmall-r regime when M (and/or M \u2217 ) is large and the\ndensity is very small.
