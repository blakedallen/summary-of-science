In a weakly interacting hot gluon\nplasma, \u03b7 is inversely proportional to the scattering rate, \u03b7 \u221d 1/\u0393 \u221d 1/\u03b12s ln \u03b1\u22121\ns [1], where \u03b1s is the strong coupling\n\u00012\nconstant. \u03b6 is suppressed by an additional factor of T\u03bc\u03bc , arising from the response of the trace of the energy\n\u0001\nmomentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bc to a uniform expansion. Thus, \u03b6 vanishes when the system is \"conformal\" or scale invariant.\nFor a gluon plasma, the running of the coupling constant breaks the scale invariance. Thus, T\u03bc\u03bc \u221d \u03b2 (\u03b1s ) \u221d \u03b12s ,\n\u03b6 \u221d \u03b12s / ln \u03b1s\u22121 [2]. In the perturbative region, \u03b6/\u03b7 \u221d \u03b14s \u226a 1.\nIn the strong coupling region, smaller \u03b7 is expected. The so-called \"perfect fluid\" is a fluid with the smallest shear\nviscosity per entropy density (s) ratio, \u03b7/s. It is conjectured that \u03b7/s has a minimum bound 1/(4\u03c0) [3]. This is\nmotivated by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics because \u03b7/s is related to \u2206E\u2206t, the mean energy and\nlife time of quasiparticles. While the number 1/(4\u03c0) arises from the universal value \u03b7/s = 1/(4\u03c0) obtained for a big\nclass of strongly interacting conformal field theories (CFT's) in the large N , N being the size of the gauge group,\nand large t'Hooft coupling limits [3\u20135]. This class of strongly interacting CFT's are dual to another class of weakly\ninteracting gravitational theories in anti-de-Sitter space backgrounds. This anti-de-Sitter space/conformal field theory\ncorrespondence (AdS/CFT) [6\u20138] allows that \u03b7/s in strongly interacting CFT's can be computed in weakly interacting\ngravitational theories.\nThe smallest \u03b7/s known so far is realized in the hot and dense matter (thought to be a quark gluon plasma of\nQCD) just above the phase transition temperature (Tc ) produced at RHIC [9\u201311] with \u03b7/s = 0.1 \u00b1 0.1(theory) \u00b1\n0.08(experiment) [12]. A robust upper limit \u03b7/s < 5 \u00d7 1/(4\u03c0) was extracted by another group [13] and a lattice\ncomputation of gluon plasma yields \u03b7/s = 0.102(56) (at temperature T = 1.24Tc) [14]. Away from Tc , \u03b7/s of QCD\nbecomes larger due to small couplings at high T or small derivative Goldstone boson couplings at low T . We will\nsummarize the current status of QCD \u03b7/s vs. T in Fig. 7.\nAs for the bulk viscosity \u03b6, it is small in the perturbative region. However, near Tc , the rapid change of degrees of\nfreedom gives a rapid change of T\u03bc\u03bc which could give very large \u03b6/s [15, 16].\nThe best perturbative QCD calculation of \u03b6 was carried out by Arnold, Dogan and Moore (ADM) [2] using the\nsame approach as the \u03b7 computed by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe (AMY) in Refs. [1, 17]. In both \u03b7 and \u03b6, the leading\norder (LO) contribution involves the elastic process gg \u2194 gg (22), inelastic number changing process gg \u2194 ggg (23)\nand multiple scattering processes known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In the complete leading\n\n\f2\norder computations for \u03b7 and \u03b6 obtained by AMY and ADM, respectively, the inelastic processes were computed using\nan effective g \u2194 gg gluon splitting obtained after solving sophisticated integral equations.\nIn this paper, we study how complementary calculations with the 22 and 23 processes and a simple treatment to\nmodel the LPM effect compare with the results of AMY and ADM. This approach is similar to the one used by Xu\nand Greiner (XG) [18, 19] who claimed that the dominant contribution to \u03b7 is 23 instead of 22, in sharp contradiction\nto the result of AMY. While our approach is not model independent due to our simplified treatment of the LPM\neffect, it can be used to double check XG's result since the two approaches are very similar. We find that we cannot\nreproduce XG's result unless the 23 collision rate is at least multiplied by a factor 6 (part of this result was asserted\nin Ref. [20]). In the mean time, our \u03b7 agrees with AMY's within errors, while our \u03b6 also agrees with ADM's within\nerrors.\nAlthough our result does not provide a model independent check to AMY and ADM's results, we can still study\nthe angular correlation between final state gluons using our approach. Because the 23 matrix element that we use is\nexact in vacuum, we can check, modulo some model dependent medium effect, whether the correlation is dominated\nby the near collinear splitting as asserted by AMY and ADM.\nWe study the distribution of the minimum angle \u03b8 among the final state gluons. If the near collinear splittings\ndominate, then most probable configurations would be that two gluons' directions are strongly correlated and their\nrelative angle tends to be the smallest among the three relative angles in the final state. This can be seen most easily\nin the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the 23 collision with two gluons going along about the same direction while the\nthird one is moving in the opposite direction. We expect\n\u221a it is also the case in the fluid local rest frame.\nWe find that the distribution of \u03b8 is peaked at \u03b8 \u223c \u03b1s , analogous to the near collinear splitting asserted by AMY\nand ADM. However, the average of \u03b8, h\u03b8i, is much bigger than its peak value, as its distribution is skewed with a long\ntail.\nThe same \u03b8 behavior is also seen if the 23 matrix element is taken to the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit in the\nCM frame. This suggests that the soft gluon bremsstrahlung in the CM frame still has some near collinear behavior\nin the fluid local rest frame.\nWe also generalize our result to a general SU (Nc ) pure gauge theory and summarize the current viscosity computations in QCD.\nII.\n\nKINETIC THEORY WITH THE 22 AND 23 PROCESSES\n\nIn this section, we will focus on the \u03b6 computation. We refer the formulation for calculating \u03b7 to Ref. [20].\nUsing the Kubo formula, \u03b6 can be calculated through the linearized response function of a thermal equilibrium\nstate |\u03a9i\nZ \u221e Z\n1\n\u03b6 = lim\ndt d3 x ei\u03c9t h\u03a9 [T\u03bc\u03bc (x), T\u03bd\u03bd (0)] \u03a9i .\n(1)\n\u03c9\u21920 9\u03c9 0\nIn the LO expansion of the coupling constant, the computation involves an infinite number of diagrams [21, 22].\nHowever, it is proven that the summation of the LO diagrams in a weakly coupled \u03c64 theory [21\u201325] or in hot\nQED [26] is equivalent to solving the linearized Boltzmann equation with temperature-dependent particle masses and\nscattering amplitudes. This conclusion is expected to hold in perturbative QCD as well.\nThe Boltzmann equation of a hot gluon plasma describes the evolution of the color and spin averaged gluon\ndistribution function fp (x) which is a function of space-time x = (t, x) and momentum p = (Ep , p).\nThe Boltzmann equation for the gluon plasma [27\u201332] reads\nZ\n1\np\u03bc\n1 X\n\u2202\u03bc fp =\nd\u03931***l\u2192(l+1)***(n\u22121)p\nEp\nNg\nN (n, l) 1***(n\u22121)\n(n,l)\n\"\n#\nl\nn\u22121\nl\nn\u22121\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\u00d7 (1 + fp )\nfr\n(2)\n(1 + fs ) \u2212 fp\n(1 + fr )\nfs .\nr=1\n\ns=l+1\n\nr=1\n\ns=l+1\n\nThe collision kernel\nd\u03931***l\u2192(l+1)***(n\u22121)p \u2261\n\nn\u22121\nY\nj=1\n\nl\nn\u22121\nX\nX\nd3 pj\n1\n2\n4 4\n|M\n|\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b4\n(\np\n\u2212\nps \u2212 p)\nr\n1***l\u2192(l+1)***(n\u22121)p\n3\n(2\u03c0) 2Ej 2Ep\nr=1\n\n(3)\n\ns=l+1\n\nhas summed over all colors and helicities of the initial and final states in the matrix element squared.

The HTL self-energies \u03a0L\n(longitudinal) and \u03a0T (transverse) are given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nx 1+x\n\u03c0\n\u03a0L = m2D 1 \u2212 ln\n+i x ,\n2 1\u2212x\n2\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n\u03c0\nx\nx\n1+x\n+ (1 \u2212 x2 ) ln\n\u2212 i x(1 \u2212 x2 ) .\n\u03a0T = m2D\n(8)\n2\n4\n1\u2212x\n4\nThe external gluon mass m\u221e (i.e. the asymptotic mass) is the mass for an on-shell transverse gluon. In both the\nHTL approximation and the full one-loop result, m2\u221e = \u03a0T (|x| = 1) = m2D /2, where mD = (4\u03c0\u03b1s Nc /3)1/2 T is the\nDebye mass.\nPrevious perturbative analyses showed that the most important plasma effects are the thermal masses \u223c gT acquired\nby the hard thermal particles [39\u201341]. So a simpler (though less accurate) treatment for the regulator is to insert mD\nto the gluon propagator such that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n2\n2\n|M12\u219234 | \u2248 8Ng (4\u03c0\u03b1s Nc s)\n.\n(9)\n+\n(t \u2212 m2D )2\n(u \u2212 m2D )2\nIt can be shown easily that Eqs. (7) and (9) coincide in the center-of-mass (CM) frame in vacuum. This treatment\nwas used in Refs. [18, 29, 42].\nEq. (9) is often expressed in qT , the transverse component of q with respect to p1 , in the CM frame. If we just\ninclude the final state phase space of the t-channel, near forward angle scatterings (q2 \u2248 q2T \u2248 0), then the backward\nangle contribution from the u-channel can be included by multiplying the prefactor by a factor 2\n|M12\u219234 |2CM\n\n\u22482\n\nq2 \u2248qT \u22480\n\n16Ng (4\u03c0\u03b1s Nc )2\n\n(q2T\n\ns2\n.\n+ m2D )2\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nBut if one includes the whole phase space in the calculation, then the factor 2 is not needed:\n|M12\u219234 |2CM\n\n\u2248 8Ng (4\u03c0\u03b1s Nc )2\n2\n\nqT \u22480\n\n(q2T\n\ns2\n.\n+ m2D )2\n\n(11)\n\nNote that the constraint q2 \u2248 0 is removed because both the near forward and backward scatterings have small q2T\nbut only the near forward scatterings have small q2 .\nFor the 23 process, because the matrix element is already quite complicated, we will just take\nP5 mD as the internal\ngluon mass as was done in the \u03b7 computation in Ref. [20] and then estimate the errors. In the i=1 pi = 0 convention,\none can easily show that an internal gluon will have a momentum of \u00b1(pi + pj ) rather than \u00b1(pi \u2212 pj ). Therefore,\nthe gluon propagator factors (ij) in the denominator of Eq. (5), is replaced by\n1\n[(pi + pj )2 \u2212 m2D ]\n2\n2m2\u221e \u2212 m2D\n= pi * pj +\n2\n= pi * pj .\n\n(ij) =\n\n(12)\n\nAccidentally, (ij) = pi * pj is still correct after we have used the asymptotic mass for the external gluon mass. Then\none applies Eq. (6) for the Boltzmann equation. In the numerator, the (ij)4 combination is set by T and is O(T 8 ).\nSo we can still apply the substitution of Eq.(12), even if the (ij) factors might not have the inverse propagator form.\nThe error is \u223c m2D (ij)3 = O(\u03b1s T 8 ), which is higher order in \u03b1s .\nIt is instructive to show that Eqs. (5,6) and (12) give the correct soft bremsstrahlung limit. Using the light-cone\nvariable\n\u0001\np = p + , p \u2212 , pT\n\u2261 (p0 + p3 , p0 \u2212 p3 , p1 , p2 ) ,\n(13)\nwe can rewrite one momentum configuration in the CM frame in terms of p, p\u2032 , q and k: p1 = p, p2 = p\u2032 , p3 = p + q \u2212 k,\np4 = p\u2032 \u2212 q and p5 = k, with\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\np =\ns, m2\u221e / s, 0, 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u221a \u221a\np\u2032 = m2\u221e / s, s, 0, 0 ,\n\u0001 \u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\nk = y s, kT2 + m2\u221e /y s, kT , 0 ,\n\u0001\n(14)\nq = q + , q \u2212 , qT .\nThe on-shell condition p23 = p24 = m2\u221e yields\n\n\u221a\nq + \u2243 \u2212qT2 / s,\nk 2 + yqT2 \u2212 2ykT * qT + (1 \u2212 y + y 2 )m2\u221e\n\u221a\n.\nq\u2212 \u2243 T\ny (1 \u2212 y) s\n\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nHere y = k + /p+ = kT ez / s is the light-cone momentum fraction of the bremsstrahlung gluon and z is its rapidity.\nIn the central rapidity for the bremsstrahlung gluon, i.e. z \u223c 0, y is toward zero. In this case p5 = k is very small\ncompared to p1 and p2 .\n\u221a\nNow, in the limit s \u2192 \u221e, y \u2192 0, while keeping y s fixed, we have\n\u0001\n\u221a\np =\ns, 0, 0, 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u221a\np\u2032 = 0, s, 0, 0 ,\n\u0001 \u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\nk = y s, kT2 + m2\u221e /y s, kT , 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u221a\n(16)\nq = 0, kT2 + m2\u221e /y s, qT .\n\u221a\nIn this limit, p1\u22124 are hard (their three momenta\u221aare O ( s)) while q(= p2 \u2212 p4 = \u2212p1 + p3 + p5 ) and p5 = k are\nsoft (their three momenta are much smaller than s). In this particular limit of the phase space, the matrix element\nbecomes\n2\n\n|M12\u2192345 |CM \u2248 32(4\u03c0\u03b1s Nc )3 Ng\n\ns2\n\nh\ni.\n(kT2 + m2\u221e ) (qT2 + m2D ) (kT \u2212 qT )2 + m2D\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\nwhere the prefactor is equivalent to 3456\u03c0 3 \u03b13s Ng2 when Nc = 3. Note that there are 6 different permutations of\n(p3 , p4 , p5 ) which give the same expression as Eq. (17) due to the permutation symmetry of Eq. (5). Those permutations are corresponding to different symmetric diagrams, just as the two permutations of (p3 , p4 ) in Eq. (9) give the tand u-channel diagrams by the crossing symmetry. Analogous to Eqs. (10) and (11), if we only include the constraint\nphase space of (p3 , p4 , p5 ), then we need to multiple Eq. (17) by a factor 6 to take into account the permutations\nof (p3 , p4 , p5 ). But if we include all the phase space in the calculation, then Eqs. (5) and (6) have to be used. Any\nadditional symmetry factor will result in multiple counting.\nThe ratio of Eq. (17) to Eq. (11) reproduces the Gunion-Bertsch (GB) formula [43] after taking mD , m\u221e \u2192 0.\nOne can find the derivation of the GB formula from Eq. (5) in Appendix A. One can also expand the \"exact\" matrix\nelement in Eqs. (5,6) in terms of t/s to extend the GB formula [44\u201347].\nAn intuitive explanation of the LPM effect was given in Ref. [48]: for the soft bremsstrahlung gluon with transverse\nmomentum kT , the mother gluon has a transverse momentum uncertainty \u223c kT and a size uncertainty \u223c 1/kT . It\ntakes the bremsstrahlung gluon the formation time t \u223c 1/ (kT vT ) \u223c Ek /kT 2 to fly far enough from the mother gluon\nto be resolved as a radiation. But if the formation time is longer than the mean free path lmf p \u2248 O(\u03b1\u22121\ns ), then the\nradiation is incomplete and it would be resolved as gg \u2192 gg instead of gg \u2192 ggg. Thus, the resolution scale is set by\nt \u2264 lmf p . This yields an IR cut-off kT2 \u2265 Ek /lmf p \u2248 O(\u03b1s ) on the phase space [49]. Thus, the LPM effect reduces the\n23 collision rate and will increase \u03b7 and \u03b6. Our previous calculation on \u03b7 using the Gunion-Bertsch formula shows\nthat implementing the mD regulator gives a very close result to the LPM effect [42]. Thus, we will estimate the size\nof the LPM effect by increasing the external gluon mass mg from m\u221e to mD .\nIII.\n\nAN ALGORITHM BEYOND VARIATION TO SOLVE FOR \u03b6\n\nFollowing the derivation of Ref. [22], the energy momentum tensor of the weakly interacting gluon plasma in kinetic\ntheory can be modified as\nZ\nd3 p\nT\u03bc\u03bd (x) = Ng\nfp (x) (p\u03bc p\u03bd \u2212 \u03a3(x)g\u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n(18)\n(2\u03c0)3 Ep\np\nwhere \u03a3(x) is an effective mass squared from the self-energy which encodes medium effects and Ep = p2 + m2\u221e .\nWhen the system deviates from thermal equilibrium infinitesimally, fp (x) deviates from its equilibrium value fpeq =\n(ev*p/T \u2212 1)\u22121\nfp = fpeq + \u03b4fp .\n\n(19)\n\nAnd so does T\u03bc\u03bd :\n\u03b4T\u03bc\u03bd = Ng\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nd3 p\n2 \u2202m\u221e\np\np\n\u2212\nv\nv\nT\n,\n\u03b4f\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\np\n(2\u03c0)3 Ep\n\u2202T 2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the energy momentum conservation \u2202 \u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 has been imposed.\nIn hydrodynamics, small deviations from thermal equilibrium can be systematically described by derivative expansions of hydrodynamical variables with respect to spacetime. We will be working at the v(x) = 0 frame for a specific\nspacetime point x (i.e. the local fluid rest frame). This implies \u2202\u03bd v 0 = 0 after taking a derivative on v\u03bc (x)v \u03bc (x) = 1.\nThen energy momentum conservation and thermal dynamic relations (we have used the property that there is no\nconserved charge in the system) in equilibrium allow us to express the time derivatives \u2202t T and \u2202t v in terms of the\nspacial derivatives \u2207 * v and \u2207T . Thus, to the first derivative expansion of the hydrodynamical variables v and T ,\nthe bulk and shear viscosities are defined by the small deviation of T\u03bc\u03bd away from equilibrium:\n\u0012 i\n\u0013\n\u2202v\n\u2202v j\n2\n\u03b4Tij = \u2212\u03b6\u03b4ij \u2207 * v \u2212 \u03b7\n+\n\u2212 \u03b4ij \u2207 * v ,\n(21)\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n3\nwhere i and j are spacial indexes. Also, \u03b4T0i (x) = 0, since the momentum density at point x is zero in the local fluid\nrest frame, and one defines T00 to be the energy density in this frame. Therefore,\nZ\n\u0001\nd3 p\n\u03b4T00 = 0 = Ng\n(22)\ne2 ,\n\u03b4fp p2 + m\n3\n(2\u03c0) Ep\n\nwhere\n\nm\ne 2 \u2261 m2\u221e \u2212 T 2\n\n1\n11 2 2 2\n\u2202m2\u221e\n= \u2212 Nc \u03b2(g 2 )T 2 =\nN \u03b1 T .\n2\n\u2202T\n6\n18 c s\n\n(23)\n\n\f6\nMatching kinetic theory (Eq.(20)) to hydrodynamics (Eq.(21)) to the first derivative order, \u03b4fp can be parameterized\nas\n\u03b4fp = \u2212\u03c7p fpeq (1 + fpeq ),\n\n(24)\n\nwhere\nA(p)\nBij (p) 1\n\u03c7p =\n\u2207*v+\nT\nT 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u2202v i\n\u2202v j\n2\n+\n\u2212 \u03b4ij \u2207 * v .\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n3\n\n(25)\n\nWe can further write Bij (p) = B(p)(p\u0302i p\u0302j \u2212 13 \u03b4ij ) with p\u0302 the unit vector in the p direction. A(p) and B(p) are\nfunctions of p. They can be determined by the Boltzmann equation to give the solution of the bulk and shear\nviscosities, respectively. In this work, we will focus on solving the bulk viscosity.\nWorking to the first derivative order, the Boltzmann equation becomes a linear equation in \u03b4fp which yields\nZ\np2\nEp\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 cs (p + m\ne ) =\nd\u039312\u21923p f1eq f2eq (1 + f3eq )(fpeq )\u22121 [A3 + Ap \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2 ]\n3\n2Ng 123\nZ\nEp\nd\u039312\u219234p f1eq f2eq (1 + f3eq )(1 + f4eq )(fpeq )\u22121 [A3 + A4 + Ap \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2 ]\n+\n4Ng 1234\nZ\nEp\n+\nd\u0393123\u21924p f1eq f2eq f3eq (1 + f4eq )(fpeq )\u22121 [A4 + Ap \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2 \u2212 A3 ].\n(26)\n6Ng 1234\nHere we have used the notation Ap \u2261 A(p) and Ai \u2261 A(pi ) with i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

Then we show\nhow one can go beyond variation to find the answer systematically. Let us rewrite Eq.(26) schematically as\n|Si = C |Ai ,\n\n(31)\n\n\u03b6 = hA|Si = hA |C| Ai .\n\n(32)\n\nand Eqs. (28,29) as\n\n\f7\nNote that Eq. (32) is just a projection of Eq. (31). Using |Ai = C \u22121 |Si from Eq.

But this will not give the correct viscosity if C |Aanz i 6= |Si. However,\nthe resulting bulk viscosity is always less than the real one,\n\u03b6anz = \u2212 hAanz |C| Aanz i + 2 hAanz |Si\n= \u2212 hA\u2032anz |C| A\u2032anz i + S C \u22121 S\n\u2264\n\nS C \u22121 S = \u03b6,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere |A\u2032anz i \u2261 |Aanz i \u2212 C \u22121 |Si and hA\u2032anz |C| A\u2032anz i is real and non-negative. Thus, a variational calculation of \u03b6 is\npossible: one just demands hS|Aanz i = hAanz |C| Aanz i and try to find the maximum \u03b6anz . In what follows, we show\nan algorithm (see Eqs.(35)-(42))\nthat will approach\nthe maximum \u03b6anz systematically.\nn\no\nWe will choose a basis \u00c3i |i = 1, 2, . . . , n with n orthonormal functions satisfying\nE\nD\n\u00c3i |C| \u00c3j = \u03b4ij .\n\nWe impose the following condition for \u00c3i\nZ\n\n(35)\n\nd3 p\nf eq (1 + fpeq )(p2 + m\ne 2 )\u00c3i (p) = 0,\n(2\u03c0)3 Ep p\n\nand we take the ansatz for A\n\nA(n)\nanz \u2261\n\nn\nX\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\ndi \u00c3i ,\n\ni=1\n\nso that the constraint \u03b4T00 = 0 is automatically satisfied.

However, what we want is the solution that maximizes \u03b6anz , which is\nunique.

Also, we have \u03b6 \u2265 \u03b6anz from Eq. (34). This\nyields\n(n)\n(n+1)\n(n\u2192\u221e)\n\u03b6anz\n\u2264 \u03b6anz\n\u2264 \u03b6anz\n= \u03b6,\n\n(42)\n\n\f8\n(n)\n\nwhich means we can systematically approaches \u03b6 from below by increasing n, then we will see \u03b6anz becomes larger and\n(n)\nlarger. We stop at a finite n when a good convergence of the series \u03b6anz is observed. So this algorithm systematically\napproaches \u03b6 from below.\nWe will use the following basis\n\u00c3i =\n\ni\nX\n\ncj (Ep /T )j ,\n\n(43)\n\nj=0\n\n(n)\n\nwhere Aanz is given by\n(n)\n=\nAanz\n\nn\nX\n\ndi \u00c3i =\n\nn\nX\n\nc\u0303i (Ep /T )i .\n\n(44)\n\ni=0\n\ni=1\n\nThe orthonormal condition\nD in Eq.

Equivalently, one can also solve for\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nc\u0303i directly by demanding S|Aanz = Aanz |C| Aanz is satisfied and the c\u0303i solution gives the maximum \u03b6anz . Note\nD\nE\nD\nE\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nthat although the Ep term does not contribute to Aanz |C| Aanz or S|Aanz , it does not mean the c1 coefficient\nis not fixed in this procedure. c1 is fixed by the constraint \u03b4T00 = 0.\nAn alternative basis is used in Ref.

For example, at \u03b1s = 0.1, the agreement is better than 1% when we work up to\nn = 6.\nIV.\n\nNc SCALING AND NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA.\n\nNc Scaling\n\nViscosities of a general SU (Nc ) pure gauge theory can be obtained by simply rescaling the SU (3) result. Using the\nabove formulas, it is easy to show that\n\u03b6 = Ng g1 (\u03b1s Nc ) T 3 , \u03b7 = Ng g2 (\u03b1s Nc ) T 3 ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere g1 and g2 are dimensionless functions of \u03b1s Nc only. This, together with s \u221d Ng , yields\n\u03b6\n\u03b7\n= h1 (\u03b1s Nc ) ,\n= h2 (\u03b1s Nc ) ,\ns\ns\n\n(47)\n\nwhere h1 and h2 are also dimensionless functions of \u03b1s Nc only. Thus, our \u03b6/s, \u03b7/s and \u03b6/\u03b7 vs. \u03b1s Nc curves in Fig. 6\nare universal and suitable for a general SU (Nc ) pure gauge theory. From now on, Nc = 3 unless otherwise specified.\nOne can always rescale the results to an arbitrary Nc .\nB.\n\nLeading-Log result\n\nAs discussed above, in the leading-log approximation, one just needs to focus on the small qT contribution from\nthe 22 process while setting c0 = 0. Furthermore, it was shown in [51, 52] that using the HTL regulator (7) gives the\nsame LL shear viscosity to that using the mD regulator (9). For the bulk viscosity, this is also true. We obtained the\nsame LL result as [2],\nT 3 \u03b12s\n.\nln(1/g)\n\n(48)\n\nT3\n.\n\u03b12s ln(1/g)\n\n(49)\n\n\u03b6LL \u2243 0.44\nThis can be compared with [1, 20]\n\u03b7LL \u2243 0.17\n\n\f9\nFigure 1: (Color online) (a) The ratio of our numerical result (denoted as \"exact\") for the shear viscosity \u03b7 to AMY's.

(5-7,12), Ep = p2 + m2\u221e in kinematics\nand fpeq for the external gluon distribution. The errors from not implementing HTL propagator in the 23 process\n\u221a\nand the modeling of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, and from the uncalculated O( \u03b1s ) higher order\ncorrections are estimated in Appendix B.\nIn Fig. 1, we show our main result for the shear viscosity \u03b7 in our previous paper [42], together with the theoretical\nerror band bounded by \"upper bound\" and \"lower bound\" curves. Note that previously we estimated the higher order\n\n\f10\nFigure 3: (Color online) (a) Comparison of our result for the bulk viscosity \u03b6 and its error band (see the appendix) with ADM's\nresult.

But since the expansion parameter in finite temperature field theory is g instead of\n\u221a\ng 2 , we enlarge the error of the higher order effect to O( \u03b1s ) here. The result agrees with AMY's result within errors\nin the left panel although our central value is lower at larger \u03b1s . If we replace the \"exact\" matrix element of Eqs.\n(5-7,12) by the GB matrix element of Eq. (17), then \u03b7 is reduced but still close to the estimated lower bound. This\nmeans the 23 collision rate in GB is bigger than that in \"exact.\"\nThe effect of the 23 process can be seen more clearly in the ratio \u03b7/\u03b722 (\u03b722 means the shear viscosity with the\n22 process included only) shown in the right panel, where we also show AMY's and XG's results for comparison. In\nAMY's result [1, 17], the near collinear 1 \u2194 2 process gives \u03b7/\u03b722 close to unity. This implies their 12 collision is just\na small perturbation to the 22 rate. However, XG employ the soft gluon bremsstrahlung approximation in the matrix\nelement for the 23 process, gives \u03b7/\u03b722 \u2243 0.11 \u223c 0.16 around 1/8 in Ref. [18], indicating that their 23 collision rate\nis about 7 times the 22 one. In their improved treatment using the Kubo relation [19], they give \u03b7/\u03b722 \u2243 0.1 \u223c 0.3,\nindicating that the 23 collision rate is about 2\u223c9 times the 22 rate.\nOur central result lies between AMY's and XG's results. However, even consider the lower bound, our 23 rate does\nnot get bigger than the 22 rate. Thus, it is qualitatively consistent with AMY's result but inconsistent with XG's\nresult. When compared with AMY's result, in addition to the error band shown in the left panel, there is still \u223c 10%\ndifference at \u03b1s = 0.01. This is consistent with the \u223c m2g /T 2 effect from using different inputs for external gluon\nmass- we use mg while AMY use zero.\nWe find that we cannot reproduce XG's result unless we use a 23 matrix element squared at least 6 times larger.\nTo compare with XG's calculation, we use the same m\u221e = 0 and LPM effect as XG, and\n2\n\n|M12\u2192345 |CM \u2192 6 \u00d7 54g 6 Ng2\n\nq 2 s2\ni,\nhT\n2\nkT2 (qT2 + m2D ) (kT \u2212 qT ) + m2D\n2\n\n(52)\n\nwhich is a slightly different variation of the GB matrix element squared of Eq. (17) multiplied by a factor 6 (denoted\nas \"GB\u00d76\"). This reproduces XG's result at \u03b1s = 0.01. The origin of this discrepancy is yet to be resolved.\nIn Fig. 2, \u03b7/s with various inputs are shown. At \u03b1s = 0.3 and 0.6, the GB\u00d76 curve yields \u03b7/s = 0.19 and 0.09,\nrespectively, while XG has 0.13 and 0.08. The central value of the \"exact\" result is about two times lager.\nOur result for the bulk viscosity \u03b6 using the \"exact\" matrix element for the 23 process is shown in Fig. 3. We have\n(6)\n(n)\nworked up to n = 6 and seen good convergence. For example, we obtain \u03b6anz \u223c 95%, 98%, 99.5% of \u03b6anz at \u03b1s = 10\u22124\n\u22128\nfor n = 3, 4, 5 respectively. The convergence for larger \u03b1s is even better. When \u03b1s . 10 , our result approaches\nthe LL one. At larger \u03b1s , the 23 process becomes more important such that when \u03b1s & 0.1, \u03b6 is saturated by the 23\ncontribution (see the right panel of Fig. 3). Our result agrees with that of ADM [2] in the full range of \u03b1s within the\nerror band explained in the Appendix B.\n\n\f11\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n2\n\ndistribution\n\ndistribution\n\ndistribution\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) The distribution of \u03b8 in the fluid local rest frame.

Because\nthe 23 matrix element that we use is exact in vacuum, we can check, modulo some model dependent medium effect,\nwhether the correlation is dominated by the near collinear splittings as asserted by AMY and ADM.\nWe study the distribution of the minimum angle \u03b8 among the final state gluons. If the near collinear splittings\ndominate, then the most probable configuration would be that two gluons whose angles are strongly correlated and\ntheir relative angle tends to be the smallest among the three relative angles in the final state. This can be seen most\neasily in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the 23 collision with two gluons going along about the same direction while\nthe third one is moving in the opposite direction. We expect it is also the case in the fluid local rest frame.\n\u221a\nWe find that the distribution of \u03b8 is peaked at \u03b8peak \u223c \u03b1s , analogous to the near collinear splitting asserted by\nAMY and ADM. However, the average of \u03b8, h\u03b8i, is much bigger than its peak value, as its distribution is skewed with\na long tail. Below are more detailed descriptions of our results.\n\n\f12\nFigure 6: (Color online) Universal curves for \u03b6/s (this work), \u03b7/s [20] and their ratio.

In both figures, the left panel is the distribution weighted by the phase space and the\nBose-Einstein distribution functions, the middle panel is weighted by the 23 contribution to \u03b7 (denoted as \u03b723 , which\nis the \u03b7 analogy of the second term in Eq. (29)) with the \"exact\" matrix element, and the right panel is similar to the\nmiddle one with the GB matrix element.\nWe first look at the distribution in the fluid local rest frame in Fig. 4. The left panel plots do not depend on the\ninteraction and hence is \u03b1s independent. The distribution has \u03b8peak \u2243 h\u03b8i and the variation \u03c3\u03b8 is about the same\nsize. In the middle panel, the \u03b723 weighted distribution with the \"exact\" matrix element, on the other hand, has\n\u221a\n\u03b8peak \u223c \u03b1s at small \u03b1s , while h\u03b8i is significantly bigger and \u03c3\u03b8 is close to its value in the left panel. In the right\n\u221a\npanel, where the GB matrix element is used, \u03b8peak is still close to be proportional to \u03b1s at small \u03b1s , but the angle\nis about twice as big as the \"exact\" case.\nThe distribution in the 23 collision CM frame shown in Fig. 5 has a similar behavior as that in the fluid local rest\nframe but the angles are in general much larger.\nThe above analysis suggests that the GB formula, which takes the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit in the CM frame,\nstill has some near collinear splitting behavior in the fluid local rest frame. It is curious what the nature of the long\ntail is. We will leave it for future investigation.\nE.\n\nMore aspects\n\nIn Fig. 6, our results for \u03b6/s and \u03b7/s (\u03b7/s is computed in Ref. [20]) using the \"exact\" matrix element for the\n\u00012\n23 process are shown in the left panel and their ratio \u03b6/\u03b7 in units of \u03b14s and 1/3 \u2212 c2s in the right panel. As we\nemphasize in Sec. IV A, these are universal curves suitable for a general SU (Nc ) pure gauge theory.\nThe external gluon mass m\u221e is included in the entropy density s here, but it is a higher order effect and numerically\nvery small at small \u03b1s . In the range where perturbation theory is reliable (\u03b1s . 0.1), \u03b6 is always smaller than \u03b7\n\u00012\nby at least three orders of magnitude. One can see that our result of \u03b6/\u03b7 agrees with 15 1/3 \u2212 c2s of Weinberg\nparametrically [53], and it is rather close to the LL one in Eq. (50).\nIn Fig. 7, we have plotted \u03b7/s vs. T /Tc and \u03b6/s vs. T /Tc for QCD with various number of light quark flavors\nNf (and different Tc 's are used in different systems) at zero baryon chemical potential. In \u03b7/s, T /Tc \u226a 1, the QCD\nresult is calculated by the pion gas system using the Boltzmann equation [54] (the kaon mass is more than two time\nbigger than Tc -too heavy to be important for T /Tc \u226a 1; for other calculations in hadronic gases, see [55\u201359]).\nThe T /Tc & 1 result is for gluon plasma using lattice QCD (LQCD) [14, 60, 61] (see [62] for a recent review; for a\nlattice inspired model around Tc , see e.g. Ref. [63]). This result has assumed a certain functional form for the spectral\nfunction and hence has some model dependence. Note that in this temperature region, there might be anomalous shear\nviscosity arising from coherent color fields in the early stage of the QGP [64]. We have also shown the value of \u03b7/s\nextracted from the elliptic flow (v2 ) data of RHIC using hydrodynamics: \u03b7/s = 0.1 \u00b1 0.1(theory) \u00b1 0.08(experiment)\n[12] (denoted as \"Hydro+v2 data I\") and \u03b7/s < 5 \u00d7 1/(4\u03c0) [13] (denoted as \"Hydro+v2 data II\"). And we have\nassigned a conservative temperature range T = 0.24 \u00b1 0.10 GeV that covers the initial and final temperatures in the\nhydrodynamic evolution (Tf = 0.14 GeV, Ti . 0.34 GeV).\n\n\f13\nFigure 7: (Color online) (a) \u03b7/s for a pion gas [54] and a gluon plasma with LQCD [14, 60, 61] and perturbative QCD [20],\ntogether with \u03b7/s extracted from RHIC elliptical flow (v2 ): I [12] and II [13].

Fitting to lattice data at 1.2 . T /Tc . 2 yields \u03bc \u2243 1.14\u03c0, \u039bMS \u2243 261\nMeV and Tc \u2243 202 MeV [65]. When T /Tc \u2243 3.3 and 42, \u03b1s = 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. If \u03b7/s above Tc is dominated\nby the gluon contribution so the gluon plasma result (Nf = 0) is close to that of Nf = 3 QCD 1 , then Fig. 7 shows\nthat \u03b7/s might have a local minimum at Tc [54, 66, 67] .\nFor \u03b6/s with T /Tc \u226a 1, the QCD result is calculated by the Boltzmann equation for massless [68] and massive\n[69, 70] (also in Ref. [71, 72]) pions. For massless pions, \u03b6/s is increasing in T since it is expected when the pion\nself-coupling vanishes (or equivalently the pion decay constant f\u03c0 \u2192 \u221e), \u03b6 also vanishes. Thus, the dimensionless\nz\ncombination \u03b6/s \u221d (T /f\u03c0 ) , where z is some positive number. For massive pions, the expected non-relativistic limit\n\u221a\n3/2\nfor the bulk viscosity reads [70] \u03b6 \u223c f\u03c04 T /m\u03c0 , where m\u03c0 =138 MeV is the physical pion mass and one uses\nWeinberg's low-energy result for the pion-pion cross section at low energy (low temperature) [72]. This suggests\nthe (non-relativistic) conformal symmetry is recovered at zero T when particle number conservation is imposed. In\nthe relativistic case, Ref. [69] argues that the number changing process (the 24 process, 23 not allowed by parity\nconservation) is slower than 22, so it controls the time scale for the system to go back to thermal equilibrium. At\nlow enough T , this time scale is very long since there are not many pions energetic enough to collide and produce\nfour pions. However, if the time scale is longer than that of the fire ball expansion at RHIC, the elastic scattering\n[55, 70, 73] (see also [74, 75]) is more relevant phenomenologically. For T /Tc & 1, lattice QCD calculation of a\ngluon plasma is shown [76] together with the sum rule result with Nf = 3 [15, 16]. Both of them have some model\ndependence on the shape of the spectral function used. This issue was discussed extensively in Refs. [77\u201379] which\ninspired Ref. [76] to include a delta function contribution to the spectral function which was missed in the earlier\nresult of Ref. [80]. The same delta function will modify the sum rule result [15, 16] as well. This is yet to be worked\nout.\nFor T /Tc \u226b 1, the perturbative result of the gluon plasma calculated in this work is shown. We see that although\n\u03b6/s for the massive pion case is decreasing in T for small T . It should merge to the massless pion result when the\npion thermal energy \u223c 3T is bigger than m\u03c0 . Thus, it is still possible that \u03b6/s has a local maximum at Tc as in some\nmodel calculations [67, 81, 82] provided there is no much difference between the Nf = 0 and Nf = 3 results above Tc .\n\n1\n\nIt is curious how to compute \u03b7/s below Tc for Nf = 0 and 1. There is no Goldstone mode in this case and there is no obvious gap in\nthe spectrum to justify an effective field theory treatment. The lattice QCD computation also suffers from small correlator signals due\nto heavy hadron masses in the intermediate states.\n\n\f14\nIt is very interesting that \u03b6 > \u03b7 for the gluon plasma just above Tc . This suggests a fluid could still be perfect\nwithout being conformal, like the AdS/CFT model of Ref. [81]. Finally, it is intriguing that \u03b7/s might have a local\nminimum at Tc and \u03b6/s might have a local maximum at Tc . However, despite there are many other systems exhibiting\nthis behavior for \u03b7/s [58, 66, 83, 84], there are counterexamples showing that it is not universal [85\u201388].\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have calculated the shear and bulk viscosity of a weakly interacting gluon plasma with 22 and 23 collisional\nprocesses and a simple treatment to model the LPM effect. Our results agree with the results of AMY and ADM\nwithin errors. By studying the 23 contribution to \u03b7, we find that the minimum angle \u03b8 among the final state gluons\n\u221a\nhas a distribution that is peaked at \u03b8 \u223c \u03b1s , analogous to the near collinear splitting asserted by AMY and ADM.\nHowever, the average of \u03b8 is much bigger than its peak value, as its distribution is skewed with a long tail which\nis worth further exploration. The same \u03b8 behavior is also seen if the 23 matrix element is taken to the soft gluon\nbremsstrahlung limit in the CM frame. This suggests that the soft gluon bremsstrahlung in the CM frame still has\nsome near collinear behavior in the fluid local rest frame. We also generalize our result to a general SU (Nc ) pure\ngauge theory and summarize the current theoretical results for viscosities in QCD.\nAcknowledgement: QW thanks C.

We work in the CM frame of the initial or final state where the longitudinal direction is defined as\nthat of p1 or p2 . The conditions for the soft gluon bremsstrahlung are: s \u226b piT and kT \u226b yqT (or s \u2192 \u221e and y \u2192 0).\nThis means the energy of the bremsstrahlung gluon, say E5 , is much smaller than other two gluons, E5 \u226a E3 , E4 .\nIt is convenient to use the Mandelstam-like variables defined as\ns = (p1 + p2 )2 , t = (p1 \u2212 p3 )2 , u = (p1 \u2212 p4 )2 ,\ns\u2032 = (p3 + p4 )2 , t\u2032 = (p2 \u2212 p4 )2 , u\u2032 = (p2 \u2212 p3 )2 ,\nTi5 = (ki + k5 )2 , (i = 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n(A1)\n\nHere we assume all gluons are massless, so we obtain\ns\nt\nu\n, (13) = \u2212 , (14) = \u2212 ,\n2\n2\n2\nt\u2032\ns\u2032\nu\u2032\n(23) = \u2212 , (24) = \u2212 , (34) = ,\n2\n2\n2\nT25\nT35\nT45\nT15\n, (25) =\n, (35) =\n, (45) =\n.\n(15) =\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(12) =\n\n(A2)\n\n\f15\nUsing light-cone variables in Eq.

Note that other permutations which do not appear are given by the identity (12345) =\n(15432). Then we can collect the most singular parts involving t, t\u2032 , Ti5 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) in the denominator and obtain\n|M12\u2192345 |\n\n2\n\n\u223c\n\n1\nstt\u2032 T\n\n35 T45\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nu\u2032 tt\u2032 T\n\n15 T45\n\n+\n\n1\ns\u2032 tt\u2032 T\n\n15 T25\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nutt\u2032 T\n\n25 T35\n\n,\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u2032\n\u2212 \u2032\n\u2212 \u2032\u2032\n,\nss\u2032 t\u2032 T15 T35\nss tT25 T45\nuu tT25 T45\nuu t T15 T35\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1\n(1 \u2212 y)2\n1\n1\ny2\n\u223c 2 2\n.\n+\n+\ns qT (qT \u2212 kT )2 (kT \u2212 yqT )2\n(qT \u2212 kT )2 kT2\n(kT \u2212 yqT )2 kT2\n\u2212\n\n(A5)\n\nOne can see that the matrix element squared has singularities from three poles at kT2 = 0, (qT \u2212 kT )2 = 0.

(7)\nby that of Eq. (9) with mD as the regulator, then the 22 collision rate is reduced by \u223c 30% for \u03b1s \u2243 0.005-0.1. At\nsmaller \u03b1s , the effect becomes smaller and eventually becomes negligible at \u03b1s = 10\u22128 . The reduction arises because\nthe HTL magnetic screening effect gives a smaller IR cut-off than mD . Analogously, using mD as the regulator in the\n23 process tends to under-estimate the 23 collision rate and gives a larger \u03b7 and \u03b6.\n(b) LPM effect: Our previous calculation on \u03b7 using the Gunion-Bertsch formula shows that implementing the\nmD regulator gives a very close result to the LPM effect [42]. Thus, we will estimate the size of the LPM effect by\nincreasing the external gluon mass mg from m\u221e to mD .\n\u221a\n(c) Higher order effect: The higher order effect is parametrically suppressed by O( \u03b1s ), but the size is unknown.\nComputing this effect requires a treatment beyond the Boltzmann equation [25] and the inclusion of the 33 and 24\n\u221a\nprocesses. We just estimate the effect to be \u03b1s times the leading order which is \u223c 10% at \u03b1s = 0.01. (Note that\nwe estimated the higher order effect to be O(\u03b1s ) suppressed in Ref. [42]. But since the expansion parameter in finite\ntemperature field theory is g instead of g 2 , we enlarge the error here.)\nCombining the above analyses, we consider errors from (a) to (c). To compute a recommended range of \u03b6 (the\nrange of \u03b7 is computed analogously), we will work with the R22 and R23 collision rates defined as\n\u22121\nR23\n\u2261 \u03b623 ,\n\u22121\n\n(R22 + R23 )\n\n(B1)\n\n\u2261 \u03b622+23 ,\n\nwhere \u03b623 is the bulk viscosity for a collision with the 23 process only. Using HTL instead of mD for the gluon\npropagator enhances the 22 rate by a factor of\n\u03b4\u2261\n\nR22(HT L)\n.\nR22(MD)\n\n(B2)\n\nWe will assume that the same enhancement factor appears in 23 rate as well, such that\nR23(HT L)\n\u2243 \u03b4.\nR23(MD)\n\n(B3)\n\nOn the other hand, the LPM effect is estimated to suppress the 23 rate by a factor of\n\u03b3=\n\nR23(LP M)\n.\nR23(MD)\n\n(B4)\n\nCombining the estimated HTL and LPM corrections to the 23\n\u221a rate, the 22+23 rate is likely to be in the range\n[R22 + R23 , R22 + \u03b3\u03b4R23 ], while the higher order effect gives \u00b1 \u03b1s (R22 + R23 ) corrections to the rate. Without\nfurther information, the errors are assumed to be Gaussian and uncorrelated, the total rate is\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 1\n\u03b3\u03b4 + 1\nR23 \u00b1\nR23 \u00b1 \u03b1s (R22 + R23 ) ,\nR22 +\n(B5)\n2\n2\nand the recommended upper (\u03b6+ ) and lower (\u03b6\u2212 ) range for \u03b6 are\n\u03b6\u00b1 = \u0010\n\nR22 +\n\n\u03b3\u03b4+1\n2 R23\n\n\u0011\n\nThe \u03b6\u00b1 values are shown in the left panel of Fig. 3.\n\n\u2213\n\nr\u0010\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03b4\u22121\n2 R23\n\n[1] P.
