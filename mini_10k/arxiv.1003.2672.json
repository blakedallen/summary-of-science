Some key theoretical insights into the dipolar character of these interactions have already been developed\nover the last few years [3\u20139]. It was shown that dipole-dipole forces can be quite strong\nand may give rise to complex many-body physics in cold polar gases. Molecules with dipole\nmoments, which interact via very long-range dipolar forces when oriented in an external\nelectric field, can form strongly correlated condensed matter-like systems, realize effective\nspin models, and create field-linked states [9\u201312].\nCurrently, there is also significant interest in investigations of scattering properties of\nultracold molecules. It is expected that such properties will be very different when molecules\nare held in optical dipole traps or when held in individual sites of an optical lattice. Holding\nmolecules in individual sites of an optical lattice prevents them from approaching each other\nand allow dipole-dipole forces to play a dominant role in interactions between polar molecules\n[13, 14]. Intriguingly, in lower dimensional systems, where tight confinement along one or\n\u2217\n\nE-mail:skotoch@temple.edu\n\n\f2\nmore spatial directions is applied, dipole forces can be engineered to be non-destructive or\nrepulsive and collective effects are predicted [15\u201318]. For example, Ref. [17] has suggested\na technique that decreases inelastic collisional rates and enhances elastic collisional rates\nusing a combination of external electric and microwave fields in a two-dimensional lattice.\nIn a three-dimensional trapping environment molecules can scatter freely. Generally,\npolar molecules are expected to be very fragile to the destructive nature of these collisions.\nThere is experimental evidence of the significant role that such collisions play in defining\nmolecular lifetimes [19\u201323]. The physical origin of this loss are rovibrational relaxations\nand reactive collisions, both of which occur at short-range, when the molecules are close\ntogether. An understanding and quantitative description of these collisions might help\ndefine conditions under which an ultracold molecular system is long lived. Furthermore,\nlearning about the short-range region will help to unravel the role of reactivity in ultracold\ncollisions.\nThe effect of reactivity on the molecular lifetime at ultracold temperatures, with a few\nexceptions [23, 24], remains largely unexplored. References [25\u201328] are devoted to theoretical developments towards a full quantum dynamics calculation of reactive collisions with\ncold molecules. The quantum mechanical description of reactions is challenging due to the\ncomplex nature of the differential equations and boundary conditions as well as difficulties\nwith generating potential surfaces of sufficient quality for three and four-atomic systems.\nThe most successful theories are associated with light atom-diatom systems [29\u201331] that are\nof astrophysical interest, can be Stark decelerated, or cooled with a buffer gas. Recently, extensive quantum scattering calculations in Refs. [25, 32, 33] have shown significant influence\nof so-called 'virtual states' in the entrance channel of the collision complex.\nThe interaction of molecules without an external electric field is dominated by the dispersive van der Waals forces rather than dipole-dipole interactions. At low temperatures\nquantum mechanical effects play a prominent role in the molecular scattering from such\npotentials and are crucial for the description of the interplay between inelastic and elastic collisional rates. The present study explores these dispersion interactions, which act at\nshort- to medium-range, and introduces a scattering model of ultracold polar alkali-metal\nmolecules. We use a characteristic length scale to distinguish between the dispersion and\nshort-range interaction regions. The short-range boundary, which defines the lower limit of\n6\n6\nis the isotropic disper\u001c 2Be , where C6iso /Rsr\nthe scattering model, is described by C6iso /Rsr\nsion potential and Be is the rotational constant of the ground state molecule. The short-range\nseparation Rsr must be smaller than the isotropic van der Waals length R6 = (2\u03bcC6iso /h\u03042 )1/4 ,\nwhere \u03bc is the reduced mass of the molecules. An accurate estimate of these characteristic\nlength scales for KRb and RbCs will be given below.\nOur scattering model is an extension of the theory developed by Mies and Julienne [34, 35].\nHere we modified this scattering theory by making the short-range boundary conditions more\nflexible by assuming that not all molecules that penetrate to short-range will be lost. This\nallows us to introduce two short-range parameters linked to the rovibrational structure of exit\nreaction channels. Recently, a model based on quantum defect theory has been introduced\nin Ref. [24], which accounts for the short-range interactions by connecting a complex valued\nor optical potential to the van der Waals potential.\nSince our scattering theory is solely based on the dispersion interaction potentials, we first\ncalculate molecule-molecule and atom-molecule van der Waals coefficients by integrating\nproducts of the dynamic polarizabily over imaginary frequencies. Unlike for atom-atom\ninteractions molecular interactions depend on their rotational and vibrational state and can\n\n\f3\nhave contributions from transitions within the ground state potential as well as from the\nelectronically excited spectrum. For polar molecules the former contribution is nonzero,\neven for levels with a well defined angular momentum while the excited-state contribution\ncan be significant. The excited contribution is often missing in the analyses of short-range\nmolecular interactions [17, 36].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we describe the theory of dispersion\ninteraction isotropic and anisotropic potentials between molecules and molecules with atoms.\nThe numerical potentials and van der Waals coefficients are obtained for the X 1 \u03a3+ ground\nstate of KRb and RbCs as a function of its vibrational quantum number and presented in\nSection III. Section IV gives basics of our scattering model and provide examples of the\ninelastic scattering rates for ultracold colliding molecules. The last Section V summarizes\nessential conclusions of the presented research.\nII.\n\nDISPERSION POTENTIALS FOR THE MOLECULAR INTERACTION\n\nWe describe the dispersion interaction potential between molecules A and B, each in\na rovibrational level |X, vJM i \u2261 |i, M i of their X electronic ground state, by assuming\nthat the molecules are far apart and their wavefunctions do not overlap. Here, the magnetic\nquantum number M is the projection along a laboratory fixed coordinate system of their total\nangular momentum J~ and i describes all other quantum labels. Their energy Ei only depends\non the label i and not on M . These assumptions allow us to use a (degenerate) secondorder perturbation theory similar to that described by Ref. [37]. For two molecules the\nmatrix elements of the dispersion potential between the product states |iA , MA ; iB , MB i \u2261\n|iA , MA i|iB , MB i and |iA , MA0 ; iB , MB0 i with different projection quantum numbers but the\nsame angular momenta JA and JB are\n~ = \u2212\nUdisp (R)\n\nX\nSA 6=iA ,MA\nSB 6=iB ,MB\n\nhiA , MA ; iB , MB |Vdd |SA ; SB ihSA ; SB |Vdd |iA MA0 ; iB , MB0 i\n,\nESA + ESB \u2212 (EiA + EiB )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the sums SA and SB are over all electronic, rovibrational, continuum states of\nmolecules A and B, respectively, restricted to states with energy ESA + ESB 6= EiA + EiB .\nThe operator Vdd is the dipole-dipole interaction Hamiltonian [37]\n\u221a\nX\n~ = \u2212 30\nVdd (R)\nm1 m2 m\n\n1 1 2\nm1 m2 m\n\n!\nB\ndA\n1m1 d1m2\n\nC2m (R\u0302)\n,\nR3\n\n(2)\n\n~ is\nwhere dA and dB are the two rank-1 spherical dipole operators of the molecules and R\nthe separation between and orientation of the two molecules with respect to a laboratory\naxis.

Equation (5) includes a sum over the dipole transitions\nto the rovibrational levels within the ground-state potential as well as to the rovibrational\nlevels of electronically-excited potentials. Contributions from scattering or continuum states\n\n\f5\nof the electronic potentials are also included. Finally, c is the speed of light and \u000f0 is the\nelectric constant.\nIn summary, we have found various contributions to the long-range van der Waals potential. They are characterized by their angular momentum dependence. In particular, the\nterm proportional to C6iso is independent of magnetic projections and the relative orbital\niso\nangular momentum between the molecules. The term proportional to C6,22\ninduces coupling\nbetween the magnetic projections of the two molecules without affecting the relative orbital\nangular momentum. Finally, the three C6aniso contributions do cause mixing between magiso\nnetic projections and relative orbital angular momentum. Note that the coefficients C6,22\naniso\nand C6,22\nwill be of the same order of magnitude. They both are proportional to a product\nof two \u2206\u03b1. Dispersion terms proportional to the spherical harmonic Clm (R\u0302) for l > 2 also\nexist.

These molecules are prepared in rovibrational\nstates of the ground X1 \u03a3+ potential and are of interest for on-going ultracold experiments [1,\n2, 23, 41]. We have used a non-relativistic ab initio version of the electronic structure multireference configuration interaction method [39, 40] to obtain potential energies, permanent\nand transition electric dipole moments of the KRb and RbCs molecules as a function of\ninternuclear separation. In order to determine experimental observables we combine our\nelectronic structure calculations with that of the calculation of rotational-vibrational energy\nlevels to find vibrationally-averaged transition dipole moments.\nThe isotropic C6iso coefficients between two molecules both in the J=0 rotational levels of\nthe X 1 \u03a3+ ground state potential as a function of vibrational quantum number are shown in\nFig. 1. Comparison of the two panels show that for the deeply bound J=0 vibrational levels\nthe isotropic coefficient for RbCs is almost an order of magnitude larger than for KRb. This\nis because for these levels the main contribution to the total value of C6iso is due to transitions\nwithin the ground state potential, which to good approximation is equal to d4v /(6Bv ) [36],\nwhere dv and Bv are the vibrationally averaged permanent dipole moment and rotational\nconstant of level v, respectively. The permanent dipole moment of RbCs is twice as large as\nthat of KRb, while Bv is almost half the size [2, 39, 42]. The permanent dipole moment of\nboth molecules rapidly decreases to zero with v and the X 1 \u03a3+ contribution to the van der\nWaals coefficient follows this trend. Consequently, for the highly excited vibrational levels\nthe C6iso are solely determined by transitions to electronically excited states. In fact, for\nKRb the excited state contribution plays a dominant role for all v.\nFigure 1 also shows the J=1 isotropic dispersion coefficients. These are independent of\nthe projection quantum number M . In this case the contributions from the transitions from\nJ=1 to J=0 and 2 within the ground state potential have opposite sign and nearly cancel\neach other. As a result, the value of C6iso is close or equal to the value obtained by only\nincluding the excited state contributions. The dispersion coefficient is weakly dependent on\nv. The isotropic values for the v = 0 vibrational level of the X1 \u03a3+ state of KRb and RbCs\nare given in Table I.\nThe J=0 and 1 dispersion coefficients are the same when they are solely determined by\ntransitions to electronically excited states. This is because rotational energy splittings are\n\n\f6\n200\n\n25\n20\n\nJ=0\n\n15\n\nJ=1\n\n100\n\nC6\n\nC6\n\niso\n\nJ=0 (transitions within X)\n\niso\n\n3\n\n(10 a.u.)\n\nJ=0\n\n3\n\n(10 a.u.)\n\n150\n\n30\n\n10\n\n50\n5\n\nJ=1\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nVibrational quantum number\n\n120\n\n0\n0\n\nJ=0 (transitions within X)\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nVibrational quantum number\n\nFIG. 1: Isotropic molecule-molecule van der Waals coefficients in atomic units for the J=0 and 1\nrotational levels of the X1 \u03a3+ ground state of RbCs (left panel) and KRb (right panel) as a function\nof vibrational quantum number. The curves labeled \"J = 0 (transitions within X)\" correspond to\nan isotropic van der Waals coefficient where only contributions from transitions to ro-vibrational\nlevels of the X1 \u03a3+ potential are included.\n\nnegligible compared to electronic excitation energies and the rotational energy dependence\nof ESA and ESB in Eq. 1 can be neglected. Alternatively, this independence follows from\na simple atomistic model for the dispersion coefficient of weakly bound molecules. The\nmolecular electronic wave functions are then to good approximation products of atomic\nelectronic wave functions and the molecule-molecule dispersion coefficient reduces to a sum\nof atom-atom dispersion coefficients, which do not depend on the rotational state of the\nmolecule. In fact, for RbCs+RbCs we find that C6iso \u2192 2C6 (RbCs) + C6 (Rb2 ) + C6 (Cs2 ) =\n22868 a.u. for large v using the well-characterized Rb+Rb, Rb+Cs, and Cs+Cs dispersion\ncoefficients [43]. This value is in good agreement with our results. A similar agreement is\nfound for C6iso of the interacting KRb molecules based on values of C6 from [43].\nThe collisions between two J=1 molecules are anisotropic. Once molecules are prepared\nin the specific state characterized by M , the interaction energy can depend on the relative\norientation of the two molecules. In fact, the anisotropic interaction can change the proaniso\njection quantum numbers. Figure 2 (left panel) shows our results for the anisotropic C6,02\ncoefficient as a function of vibrational quantum number for J = 1 rotational sublevels,\nM = 0 and M = \u00b11, of the X1 \u03a3+ ground state of KRb and RbCs. The anisotropy for\nRbCs changes sign as function of v due to competing contributions from the ground and\naniso\nexcited states. In both cases C6,02\ngoes to zero for highly excited vibrational levels. For\naniso\naniso\nthese collision we have C6,20 = C6,02 .\nOur predicted isotropic van der Waals C6iso coefficients for the interaction between KRb\nmolecules have been used in theoretical models [23, 24] to successfully describe the loss\nrate constant K observed in a JILA experiment as a function of temperature [23]. The\nanisotropic C6aniso coefficients can be used for describing collisions between molecules in\nnon-zero J rotational states. Our estimate shows that an experimentally-accesible external\nelectric field of 2 kV/cm will induce an \u2248 50 MHz splitting between M = 0 and M = \u00b1\n1 components of J = 1 rotational state of KRb.

For rotationless J = 0 molecules both\naniso\ncoefficient are zero. Right panel of Fig. 2 shows C6,22 for J = 1 as function of vibrational\nquantum number. These values are an order of magnitude smaller than the contributions\ndiscussed so far. The anisotropic coefficients for both molecules in the v = 0 X1 \u03a3+ state are\ngiven in Table I.\nIt was observed in Refs. [19\u201323] that the lifetime of both Feshbach and deeply bound polar\nmolecules decreases when they are in the presence of ultracold atoms. This suggests that\ncollisions between atoms and molecules play a role in limiting the molecule lifetime. These\nlosses are due to relaxation of rovibrational or hyperfine degrees of freedom that have enough\nkinetic energy to remove both molecule and atom from an external optical or magnetic trap.\nAnother possible loss channel is an ultracold chemical reaction. To understand these losses,\nwe determine the isotropic and anisotropic van der Waals coefficients for the interaction\nbetween a molecule in state |iMol , MA i and atom in state |iAt , MB i.

Rotational J=0 (1)\nlevels are shown as solid (dashed) lines, respectively. For KRb the J=0 and 1 C6iso coefficients are\nindistinguishable on the scale of a figure.\n\nthe contribution from transitions within the ground state are negligible. The lack of these\ncontributions effects the behavior of an anisotropic C6AtMol,aniso coefficient as well. As it is\nshown in Fig. 4, the values of the C6AtMol,aniso for the same projections M have the same sign.\nTable I lists the isotropic and anisotropic values for the v = 0 vibrational level of the X1 \u03a3+\nstate of KRb and RbCs with atoms.\nSimilar to the molecule-molecule dispersion potential, the van der Waals coefficients for\none molecule and one atom are additive for a weakly-bound molecule. In other words, the C6\ncoefficient for the highly excited vibrational levels can be expressed as a sum of contributions\nfrom individual di-atoms. For example, C6RbCs+Rb,iso \u2192 C6 (RbCs) + C6 (Rb2 ) = 10035 a.u.\nand C6RbCs+Cs,iso \u2192 C6 (RbCs) + C6 (Cs2 ) = 12514 a.u [43] for weakly bound RbCs molecules.\nThe agreement between the asymptotic values and our numerical calculations is satisfactory.\nThe same estimate can be done for KRb molecules interacting at long distances with K or\nRb atoms. This lead to C6KRb+Rb,iso \u2192 C6 (KRb) + C6 (Rb2 ) = 8965 a.u. and C6KRb+K,iso \u2192\nC6 (KRb) + C6 (K2 ) = 8171 a.u., which agree within a few % with the numerical values of\nFig. 3.\nIV.\n\nREACTIVE COLLISIONS OF ULTRACOLD POLAR MOLECULES\n\nThe lifetime of ultracold molecules in an optical trap is determined by the inelastic collisional loss rates between these molecules. A collision can change the internal rovibrational\nstate of the molecules as well induce reactions where the bonds between the atoms are\nrearranged. For example, for an ultracold KRb gas the reaction KRb+KRb \u2192 K2 +Rb2\nis allowed [23]. Once the molecules are prepared in their absolute ground state only the\nreactive process is present.\nThis section describes our results using a quantum reflection model of the rate coefficient\nfor rotationless J = 0 40 K87 Rb and 85 Rb133 Cs ground state molecules. It is based on a\nmodification of the approach developed in Refs. [34, 35].

Two\nshort-range parameters describe the collisional wavefunction when the molecules are \"close\"\ntogether at R = Rsr . As we will show this boundary condition models the physics or reactivity for R < Rsr and \"partially\" inelastic events can occur. The short-range parameters\ncan depend on the rovibrational state of the molecules. The isotropic van der Waals coefficients are taken from Table I. Recently, a similar model with a different treatment of the\nshort-range interactions was used in Ref. [24] for the collisions between KRb molecules.\nWe use the van der Waals potential to determine the validity of the model and estimate characteristic length scales to distinguish between the dispersion and short-range\ninteraction regions.\nThe range of the isotropic van der Waals potential is defined as\nq\n4\niso\nR < R6 \u2261 2\u03bcC6 /h\u03042 , where \u03bc is the reduced molecular mass [44].

The sum over \u03b1 excludes the initial\nstate. Flux conservation or the unitarity of the S matrix allows us to rewrite the loss rate\ncoefficient in terms of the diagonal S matrix element, Sii . At ultracold temperatures, only a\nfew partial waves l contribute as for higher l the centrifugal barrier prevents the molecules\nloss\nfrom approaching each other and Klm\nrapidly goes to zero.\nThe scattering S matrix is calculated from the radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nC6iso\nh\u03042 l(l + 1)\nh\u03042 d2\n\u2212\n+\n\u03c8lm (R) = E\u03c8lm (R)\n\u2212\n2\u03bc dR2\nR6\n2\u03bc R2\n!\n\nat collision energy E with the boundary condition\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8lm (R) = A e+i[y\u2212\u03c0/4] \u2212 \u03b6lm (E)e2i\u03b4lm (E) e\u2212i[y\u2212\u03c0/4]\n\n\u0011\n\n(9)\n\nat R = Rsr \u001c R6 , y = (R/R6 )\u22122 /2, and A is a normalization constant [44]. The exponents\ne\u00b1i[y\u2212\u03c0/4] can be recognized as WKB solutions of a van der Waals potential at zero collision\nenergy. The short range amplitude \u03b6lm (E)e2i\u03b4lm (E) and thus the real parameters \u03b6lm (E) and\n\u03b4lm (E) are not known a priori. They can only be determined from the chemical bonding\nbetween the three or four atoms. However, once they are known the boundary condition\nuniquely specifies the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Flux conservation requires that\n0 \u2264 \u03b6lm \u2264 1, where \u03b6lm = 0 corresponds to the case where no flux is returned from the short\nrange and \u03b6lm = 1 correspond to the case where everything is reflected back. The phase \u03b4lm\ndescribes the relative phase shift of the flux that returns from R < Rsr . In Ref. [24] a model\npotential with an optical or imaginary term is used to describe the short range physics for\nR < Rsr .\nThe van der Waals potential is the largest energy scale at R = Rsr and, consequently,\nwe initially assume that both \u03b6lm (E) and \u03b4lm (E) are independent of collision energy E,\npartial wave l, and projection m. The validity of these approximations can only be tested\nby comparison with experimental data. We will do so with the data on KRb loss rate\ncoefficients from Ref.

The loss\nrate of the unpolarized case contains non-negligible contributions from s and p wave contributions.\nThe polarized case only contains odd partial waves.\n\nwhere Sii (Elm) is the diagonal S matrix element required for Eq. (8). In order to determine\nthe relationship between \u03b6lm e2i\u03b4lm and Sii (E, lm) we solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation analytically in the limit Rsr \u2192 0 using the solutions from [45]. Alternatively, the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation can be solved numerically.\nThe left panel of Fig. 5 shows the total loss rate coefficient summed over l and m for\ncollisions between fermionic 40 K87 Rb molecules in the v = 0, J = 0 rovibrational state of\nthe X1 \u03a3+ potential as a function of the short-range parameters \u03b6 and \u03b4 at a collision energy\nof E/kB = 350 nK. For this figure we assume that \u03b6lm \u2261 \u03b6 and \u03b4lm \u2261 \u03b4 are independent of l\nand m. This rate coefficient can be compared with experimental data on an \"unpolarized\"\nsample of this fermionic KRb molecule with at least two equally-populated nuclear-hyperfine\nstates. The right panel shows the loss rate coefficient at E/kB = 350 nK for a \"polarized\"\nsample where all molecules are in the same nuclear hyperfine state and only odd partial wave\nscattering is allowed. In fact, for this collision energy only the p wave is significant. The p\nwave loss rate is much smaller than that for the s wave, since the centrifugal barrier is larger\nthan the 350 nK collision energy and the p-wave loss rate is reduced. We use C6iso = 16133\na.u. for both panels.\nThe most striking observation of Fig. 5 is the appearance of resonances in the loss rate.\nThe origin of this behavior is in the interference between the in- and out-going flux for\nR > Rsr . The maximum at (\u03b6 \u2248 0.8, \u03b4 \u2248 0.6\u03c0) is due to s-wave collisions and that at\n(\u03b6 \u2248 0.95, \u03b4 \u2248 0.9\u03c0) due to p-wave collisions. In fact, the loss rate is significantly larger\nthan the rate at \u03b6 = 0 when no flux returns from R < Rsr . (For \u03b6 = 0 the loss rate is\nindependent of \u03b4.) The loss rate can also be much smaller than at \u03b6 = 0. In the limit \u03b6 \u2192 1\nwe have K loss \u2192 0. For clarity, this limiting behavior is not shown in the surface plot. If we\nlearn how to change the short range parameter we can envision that a significantly reduction\nof the loss rate is possible.\nFigure 6 shows a comparison of thermally-averaged rate coefficients for ground state\n40 87\nK Rb molecules with the experimental observations of Ref. [23]. The thermal average\nassumes a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

In fact, at a temperature of 250 nK the measured unpolarized loss rate is \u03b2 = 1.9(4) * 10\u221210\ncm3 /s, while that for the polarized case is \u03b2 = 3.3(7) * 10\u221212 cm3 /s.\n\nThe experimental rates are \u03b2u = 1.9(4) * 10\u221210 cm3 /s for the unpolarized case and \u03b2p =\n3.3(7)*10\u221212 cm3 /s for the polarized case at a temperature of T = 250 nK. In the experiment\n\u03b2 was extracted from the time-dependence of the molecule number density of each nuclear\nspin state. Consequently, our theoretical loss rate has been multiplied by a factor two\nfor a polarized sample to account for the loss of two molecules per inelastic collision, and\nmultiplied by one(1) for the unpolarized sample as one atom of each nuclear hyperfine state\nis lost. Ref. [23] verified that the rates for the polarized and unpolarized sample satisify\ntheir \u03b2u \u221d const. and \u03b2p \u221d kT Wigner threshold limits as a function of temperature upto\nT \u2248 1 \u03bcK.\nThe figure shows regions in the plane (\u03b6, \u03b4), where the theoretical rate coefficient agrees\nwith the experimental rate coefficients within the uncertainties. One region is for the pwave dominated polarized case and one for the s-wave dominated unpolarized case. The\ntwo regions do no overlap. Hence, our initial assumption that the short-range parameters\nare independent of partial wave l is not valid. The validity of the Wigner threshold limit over\ncollision energies upto a few \u03bcK suggests that the short-range parameters are nevertheless\nindependent of energy over this range. In other words the behavior at R < Rsr , where\na multi-channel description is needed to describe the reactive rearrangement of the atoms,\nmust be captured by more than two parameters. The uncertainty in the dispersion coefficient\ndoes not modify this conclusion.\nFigure 7 shows the loss rate coefficient for the collision between two bosonic 87 RbCs\nmolecules in the vibrationally excited v = 1, J = 0 level of the X1 \u03a3+ potential at a collision\nenergy of E/k = 250 \u03bcK and C6iso = 142540 a.u. The nuclear hyperfine state are equally\npopulated and partial waves up to l = 8 are included.

At this collision energy many partial waves contribute.\n\nrange parameters are independent of partial wave. In the figure maxima or resonances for\nl = 5, 6, and 7 are observed. As can be found from a comparison of the binding energies\nof the v = 0 vibrational levels the three RbCs, Rb2 , and Cs2 dimer molecules, chemical\nreaction at ultracold temperature RbCs+RbCs\u2192 Cs2 +Rb2 is endothermic by \u2248 40 cm\u22121\nand not energetically allowed. For collisions between v = 1 RbCs molecules the reaction is\nexothermic. At a 250 \u03bcK collision energy rate coefficients are as large as 2 * 10\u221210 cm3 /s can\nbe seen in Fig. 7. With typical densities in ultracold experiments around 1011 1/cm3 to 1012\n1/cm3 lifetimes as short as a 10 ms could be observed.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed a theoretical study critical for the physical realization of highly controlled ultracold molecular systems. In particular, we focused on hetero-nuclear KRb and\nRbCs molecules used in ongoing ultracold experiments. Our detailed calculations of C6\ndispersion coefficients for interactions between molecules or molecules with atoms helped\nthe experimental [23] and theoretical [24] efforts to quantitatively describe quantum-state\ncontrolled chemical reactions.\nAnalyses of the isotropic and anisotropic interaction potentials of ultracold polar\nmolecules unveiled a significant contribution from dipole coupling to electronically excited\nstates. This leads to a dramatic change in the interaction potentials as compared to previous\nestimates based solely on the permanent dipole moment.\nOur scattering calculations predict constructive and destructive interferences in the\nmolecular scattering loss rates as a function of short-range parameters. Comparison to recent experimental measurements [23] shows that the initial assumption that the short-range\nparameters are independent of partial wave l is not valid.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research MURI on Ultracold\nMolecules.
