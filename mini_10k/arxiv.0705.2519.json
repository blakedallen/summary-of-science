The most useful part of the waveform for detection comes from the most relativistic part\nof the dynamics: the last few cycles of the adiabatic inspiral, the plunge and the merger. Since LIGO is currently\ntaking data at the expected sensitivity, it becomes urgent to have accurate template waveforms for detection.\nIn the most general, spinning case, these waveforms are\ncomplicated functions of the initial masses m1 and m2\nand the spins S1 and S2 of the two constituent black\nholes. Due to the multi-dimensionality of the parameter space, it seems impossible for state-of-the-art numerical simulations to densely sample this parameter space.\nThis motivates a renewed effort for developing analytical\nmethods towards computing the huge banks of accurate\ntemplate waveforms needed to densely cover the parameter space.\nAs far as we know, the first estimate of the complete\nwaveform (covering inspiral, plunge, merger and ringdown) of a coalescing, non-spinning black hole binary\nwas made in 2000 [1], on the basis of a new analytical\napproach to the general relativistic two-body dynamics,\nthe Effective-One-Body (EOB) approach [2]. At the time,\nno reliable numerical simulations of coalescing black hole\nbinaries were yet available. This EOB-based estimate\nused a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) accurate description\n\nof the dynamics (the only one available at the time1 )\nand a quadrupole-type \"restricted waveform\" approximation for the waveform down to a \"matching radius\"\nrmatch where the two-black-hole system was replaced by\na unique, ringing Kerr black hole. It was also argued that\nthe matching radius rmatch could be taken as the EOBdeformed \"light ring\", rLR , which was noticed to be very\nclose to the point where the orbital frequency reached a\nmaximum. As a first approximation, a complete waveform was computed by matching, at rmatch \u2243 rLR , the\ninspiral-plus-plunge waveform to a ring-down waveform\nmade of the least damped quasi-normal mode (QNM) of\na Kerr black hole of mass and angular momentum corresponding to those of the relative dynamics at rmatch . In\nother words, Ref. [1] was making the assumption that the\nmerger phase of the two black holes was very brief, and\ndid not correspond to any especially strong GW emission\nfeature, but would simply smoothly connect the plunge\nbehavior to the ringdown one.\nIn 2001, a combination of (rather short) full numerical simulations with a \"close-limit\" approximation [4] led\nto the first numerical estimate of the waveform emitted\nby the plunge from the ISCO, followed by merger and\nringdown [5, 6]. Very recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity simulations have finally made accessible a\n\n1\n\nThis EOB waveform estimate was later updated by taking into\naccount the more accurate 3.5 PN dynamics, as well as by considering spinning black holes [3].\n\n\f2\nmuch more precise knowledge of the waveforms generated\nby the merger of two black holes of comparable masses\nm1 and m2 , possibly with spin. These results have been\nobtained by different groups with different approaches,\nand exhibit convincing internal convergence and a nice\nmutual consistency [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nThe availability of reliable numerical results makes it urgent to compare analytical and numerical approaches for\n(i) understanding in depth the physics that is involved in\nthe process and thus (ii) completing the currently available analytical knowledge of the problem with the \"missing\" non-perturbative physics provided by numerical relativity simulations. Several different ways of combining\nthe knowledge acquired through analytical and numerical methods have been recently explored, such as the\nuse of \"hybrid\" signals made by stitching together an inspiral PN-type waveform to a NR merger one [17, 18], or\nthe study of whether some simple multiparameter (BCVtype [19]) analytical waveform can have sufficiently large\noverlaps with hybrid signals. Our aim here is different.\nWe wish, ultimately, to construct high-accuracy purely\nanalytical template waveforms, depending only on physical parameters, and covering the full process: inspiral,\nplunge, merger and ringdown; by high-accuracy we mean\nthat their phasing (and possibly their amplitude too)\nwould be very close to the true phasing, uniformly, to\na few percent. Let us recall that it is convenient (following the terminology of Ref. [20]) to distinguish effectual and faithful templates: effectual templates are defined by the property of having sufficiently large (say\n\u2265 96.5%) overlaps with the expected \"real\" signals, after maximization over all (kinematical, dynamical, and\npossibly fudge) parameters. Effectual templates maybe\nuseful tools for detecting real signals, but they might\nlead to large biases in the measurement of the physical parameters of the system. By contrast, faithful templates are defined by the property of having not only\nlarge overlaps, but also of being so \"close\" to the real signals that the overlap between the template and the real\nsignal is maximized for values of the parameters which\nare very close to the real ones (\"small biases\"). Recent\n\"first order\" comparisons between full numerical relativity waveforms and EOB-based waveforms have already\nestablished that EOB waveforms can be effectual (overlaps \u2265 96.5%) over the full mass range of interest for\nGEO/LIGO/VIRGO, say a total mass M = m1 + m2\nbetween 10 and 120 solar masses [17, 21]. Our main\naim will be to prove that EOB-based waveforms can also\nbe faithful over the full mass range of interest. Our\nmethodology for achieving this aim is to improve the\ncurrent waveform implementations [1, 3, 17, 21] of the\nEOB approach [1, 2, 22, 23, 24] by understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of\nthe waveform, and by comparing EOB-based waveforms\nwith \"exact\" waveforms obtained by numerical relativity\napproaches. In the present paper, we shall tap the information contained in small-mass-ratio waveforms. [A\npreliminary version of our results was reported in [25].]\n\nIndeed, the limiting case m1 m2 \u226a (m1 +m2 )2 constitutes\na \"clean laboratory\" where many subtle physical issues\ncan be studied in detail (and by means of rather light numerical tools), without the complications entailed by the\ncurrent three-dimensional numerical simulations (residual eccentricity, numerical noise,...). We rely on the recently developed numerical waveform computations \u00e0 la\nRegge-Wheeler-Zerilli in Ref. [26]. Note that we consider\nnon-spinning inspiralling systems circularized by radiation reaction.\nThe various improvements in the EOB waveform construction that we shall address here concern: (i) an improved analytical expression for the ((l, m) = (2, 2))\nwaveform which includes a resummation of the tail effects, and a 3PN-accurate \"non-linear\" amplitude correction, (ii) the inclusion of non-quasi-circular corrections to the waveform, (iii) a comparative study of the\ntwo radiation reaction expressions during the plunge that\nhave been proposed ([1] versus [24]), (iv) the inclusion of\nnon-quasi-circular corrections to radiation reaction, and\n(v) an improved treatment of the matching between the\nplunge and ring-down waveforms (which takes into account a new understanding of the importance of the number of QNMs, the sign of their frequencies, and the length\nof the interval on which the matching is done). We shall\nshow that the resulting improved implementation of the\nEOB approach yields very faithful waveforms whose amplitude and phase agree remarkably well with the \"exact\" ones: in particular, the EOB phasing differs from\nthe \"exact\" one by less than \u00b11.1% of a cycle over the\nwhole process.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we recall the EOB construction for the relative dynamics of\nthe binary system and specify it to the small mass ratio\nlimit. In Sec. III we discuss the computation of the GW\nemission and we focus on the comparison between different expressions of radiation reaction. Sec. IV introduces\nour \"best\" EOB-type waveform for the transition from\ninspiral to plunge and shows that it is an excellent approximation to the \"actual\" waveform. Some conclusions\nare presented in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nEOB RELATIVE DYNAMICS\n\nIn this section we recall the EOB non-perturbative\nconstruction of the two-body dynamics including a radiation reaction force and then specify it to the small\nmass limit. The EOB approach to the general relativistic two-body dynamics is a non-perturbatively resummed analytic technique which has been developed in\nRefs. [1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24]. This technique uses, as basic input, the results of PN theory, such as: (i) PN-expanded\nequations of motion for two point-like bodies, (ii) PNexpanded radiative multipole moments, and (iii) PNexpanded energy and angular momentum fluxes at infinity. For the moment, the most accurate such results are\nthe 3PN conservative dynamics [27, 28], and the 3.5PN\n\n\f3\nenergy flux [29, 30, 31]. Then the EOB approach \"packages\" this PN-expanded information in special resummed\nforms which extend the validity of the PN results beyond\nthe expected weak-field-slow-velocity regime into (part\nof) the strong-field-fast-motion regime. At the practical\nlevel, the result of this \"packaging\" is that the complicated PN-expanded relative dynamics, (in the center of\nmass frame) of a binary system of masses m1 and m2\nis mapped into the simpler (essentially geodesic) dynamics of a particle of mass \u03bc = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) moving\nin some effective background geometry (in Schwarzschild\ngauge)\nds2 = \u2212A(r)dt2 + B(r)dr2 + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) . (1)\nHere and below we work with dimensionless reduced\nvariables r = R/M and t = T /M , with M = m1 +\nm2 ; (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) are polar coordinates in the effective problem that describe the relative motion. The dynamics\nof the effective particle is described by a Hamiltonian\nHEOB (M, \u03bc) and a radiation reaction force FEOB (M, \u03bc).\nIn the general comparable-mass\ncase HEOB has the strucq\n\nture HEOB (M, \u03bc) = M 1 + 2\u03bd(\u0124\u03bd \u2212 1) where \u03bd \u2261\n\u03bc/M \u2261 m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 )2 is the symmetric mass ratio.\nIn the test mass limit that we are considering, \u03bd \u226a 1,\nwe can expand HEOB in powers of \u03bd. After subtracting inessential constants we get a Hamiltonian per unit\n(\u03bc) mass \u0124 = lim\u03bd\u21920 (HEOB \u2212 const.)/\u03bc = lim\u03bd\u21920 \u0124\u03bd .\nIt is convenient to replace the Schwarzschild radial coordinate R by the Regge-Wheeler tortoise coordinate\nR\u2217 = R + 2M log[R/(2M ) \u2212 1], and, correspondingly,\nthe radial momentum PR by the conjugate momentum\nPR\u2217 of R\u2217 . Then the (specific) Hamiltonian reads [26]\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\np2\u03c6\n\u0124 = A(r) 1 + 2 + p2r\u2217 .\n(2)\nr\nHere we have introduced dimensionless variables r \u2261\nR/M , r\u2217 \u2261 R\u2217 /M , pr\u2217 = PR\u2217 /\u03bc and p\u03c6 = P\u03c6 /(\u03bcM ). In\nthe \u03bd \u2192 0 limit, we have that A(r) = B(r)\u22121 = 1 \u2212 2/r.\nWe have used the tortoise canonical pair (r\u2217 , pr\u2217 ) instead\nof the \"traditional\" one (r, pr ) in the Hamiltonian for\ntwo related reasons. On the one hand, pr\u2217 has a finite limit when r tends to the zero of A(r) (r = 2, the\nevent horizon), while pr diverges there2 . On the other\nhand, since one of our goal is to compute the gravitational wave signal from the relative dynamics, it is very\nuseful to have the (radial-delta-function) source moving\nquasi-uniformly towards \u2212\u221e on the doubly-infinite r\u2217\naxis, rather than exponentially slowing down and getting\n\n2\n\nThis divergence leads, in particular, to numerical problems in the\nsource of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation: some \"exact\" analytical cancellations that are explicit when expressing the source\nin terms of pr\u2217 (which stays finite), become implicit when using pr and numerically tend to yield a problematically divergent\nsource.\n\nstuck at r = 2M (this allows us to cut-off more smoothly\nthe radial motion after some time).

[1] (in the comparable mass case) assumed that the\nanalytical continuation of the expression (8) might still\nbe a sufficiently accurate description of radiation reaction\neffects during the plunge. On the other hand, the authors\nof Ref. [24] pointed out that the expression (8) assumed\nthe continued validity of the usual Kepler law \u03a92 r3 \u2243 1\nduring the plunge. [This is why we label the expression\n(8) with a superscript K, for Kepler.] They, however,\nemphasized that the Kepler combination K = \u03a92 r3 significantly deviates from one after the crossing of the Last\nStable (circular) Orbit (LSO), to become of order of 0.5\nat the light ring. Ref. [24] went on to argue for a different expression for the radiation reaction, say F\u0302\u03c6 (without\nany superscript) that does not assume Kepler's law.

The light ring (at r = 3), near\nwhich the plunge waveform will be matched to a ring-down\none, is indicated (dotted circle). It is crossed at the dynamical\ntime t/2 \u2243 300 [26].\n\nwith source terms Slm linked to the dynamics of the binary. A thorough discussion of the analytical and numerical details of our approach has been given in Ref. [26],\nso that it is not necessary to repeat it here. We only\nrecall that the initial condition for the relative dynamics is given as in [26], notably by specifying a non-zero\ninitial value for pr\u2217 (\"post-adiabatic\" approximation). In\n(e/o)\naddition, the gauge-invariant functions \u03a8lm are proportional to the actual GW polarization amplitudes, and so\ntheir knowledge encodes the complete information about\nenergy, momentum and angular momentum losses.\nA.\n\nthat has already been shown to be quite robust versus\n\"exact\" numerical results in [20].\nLet us finally comment on the numerical values of the\nparameter \u03bd that we shall consider. First, we should\nconsider values such that the \u03bd\u2212dependent corrections\nin the two-body effective Hamiltonian \u0124\u03bd , i.e. the\n\u03bd\u2212dependent contributions in the EOB metric functions\nsuch as A(r) = 1 \u2212 2u + 2\u03bdu3 + * * * (where u \u2261 1/r), are\nindeed numerically negligible. However, we do not wish\nto consider too small values of \u03bd. Indeed, the present\nstudy of the inspiral, plunge and merger of a mass \u03bc\ninto a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M is intended as\na toy model of the coalescence of two comparable-mass\nblack holes. We therefore wish to minimize the quantitative difference between these two types of inspiralling\nmotions. In particular, it has been shown in Ref. [1] that\nthe number of orbits during the comparable-mass plunge\nwas roughly \u223c (4\u03bd)\u22121/5 , i.e. a number of order one when\nm1 = m2 (i.e. \u03bd = 1/4). We should not therefore consider values of \u03bd so small as to make (4\u03bd)\u22121/5 much larger\nthan one. As a compromise we shall always consider here\nthe value \u03bd = 0.01, which gives only \u223c (4\u03bd)\u22121/5 \u2243 1.9\norbits during the plunge (as will indeed appear in Fig. 1\nbelow).\n\nAngular momentum loss\n\nLet us consider the relative dynamics of a particle of\nmass \u03bc = 0.01M plunging from r = 7. The relative orbit (for both choices of radiation reaction) is shown in\nFig. 1. The dashed circle indicates the LSO, which is\ncrossed at t/2 \u2243 240, while the dotted circle indicates\nthe light ring (LR), which is crossed at t/2 \u2243 300 [26].\nThe first point we want to discuss is the comparison (and\ncontrast) between the two expressions of the angular momentum loss mentioned above, the \"usual\" Keplerian one\nF\u0302\u03c6K of Eq. (8) and F\u0302\u03c6 of Eq. (9). These two expressions\nare equivalent during the inspiral due to the validity of\nKepler's law \u03a92 r3 = 1 along circular orbits, but they\nstart strongly deviating from each other after the crossing of the LSO. We wish to know how they compare to\nsome sort of \"exact\" angular momentum flux during the\nplunge, and whether one of them is to be preferred.\nLet us now be precise in which respect we can compute\nan \"exact\" result for the angular momentum loss during\nthe plunge. We recall that via Eq. (17) of Ref. [26] one\ncan compute the instantaneous angular momentum flux\n(e/o)\nat infinity dJ/dt (as a sum of multipoles) from \u03a8lm .\nWe have done this for both F\u0302\u03c6K and F\u0302\u03c6 including all\n\n3\n\ni.e., by computing the metric perturbations of a Schwarzschild\nspacetime by means of a multipolar decomposition. See for example [32] and references therein.\n\n\f5\n\nThe physics behind the differences between the \"analytical\" and \"exact\" angular momentum fluxes (as well\nas between the two analytical ones) lies in the presence\nof non-quasi-circular (NQC) effects during the plunge\nphase. During the adiabatic inspiral one takes advantage\nof the quasi-circularity (QC) of the motion to operate\ntwo separate simplifications: (a) one neglects the terms\nproportional to dr/dt , and (b) one neglects the terms\nproportional to d2 r/dt2 , which, by using the equations\nof motion, give (modulo the square of dr/dt) terms proportional either to v 2 \u2212 1/r (\"virial combination\"), or to\n\u03a92 r3 \u2212 1 (\"Kepler combination\" minus 1). During the\nplunge, both simplifications become less and less valid\nso that one should correct any QC-derived expression by\nterms proportional to powers of the two basic dimensionless NQC ratios (dr/dt)/(\u03a9r) and (1/r \u2212 v 2 )/v 2 .

The labelling \"Flux with \u221d \u03a97/3\nRad Reac\" indicates the outcome of a dynamics with\nF\u0302\u03c6K (black line), while \"Flux with \u221d \u03a95 r4 Rad reac\"\nrefers to a dynamics using F\u0302\u03c6 (red line). Fig. 2 shows\nthat the differences in the fluxes at infinity are really\ntiny. In that sense, we know with good accuracy (assuming balance between losses at infinity and local losses)\nwhat should be the \"exact\" (local) angular momentum\nloss of the system. By contrast, the two dashed lines in\nFig. 2 represent the two analytically-assumed local angular momentum losses; i.e., the two radiation reaction\nterms F\u0302\u03c6K (t) or F\u0302\u03c6 (t). The good news is that they agree\nquite well with the \"exact\" result during not only the inspiral, but also a fair fraction of the plunge (which starts\nat u/2M \u2243 240). However, the bad news is that they\nstart differing significantly from the exact result (as well\nas from each other) during the later part of the plunge\n(say, after u/2M \u2243 290, remembering that the matching\nto ring-down will be done around u/2M \u2243 300, which\ncorresponds to light-ring crossing). The \"usual\" Keplerbased radiation reaction F\u0302\u03c6K is too large (as anticipated\nin Ref. [24] which pointed out that K = \u03a92 r3 sharply\ndecreases during the plunge, if we notice that the ratio\nF\u0302\u03c6K /F\u0302\u03c6 \u2243 K \u22124/3 ), while the hopefully better radiation\nreaction F\u0302\u03c6 turns out to be somewhat too small towards\nthe end of the plunge. On the other hand, the near coincidence of the two corresponding fluxes at infinity shows\nthat the \"analytical uncertainty\" in the radiation reaction does not matter much for computing the waveform.\nThis confirms, and makes more quantitative, the finding\nof [1, 33] that, after the crossing of the LSO, the relative\nmotion is essentially quasi-geodesic; i.e., relatively little\ninfluenced by the radiation-reaction force.\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n280\n\n285\n\n50\n\n290\n\n295\n\n100\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n150\n\n320\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nu/(2M)\n\nFIG. 2: Comparison between various angular momentum\nlosses: GW fluxes at infinity (solid lines; computed \u00e0 la ReggeWheeler-Zerilli including up to l = 4 radiation multipoles,\nusing two types of radiation reaction in the driving dynamics: 'K' (black) or 'not K' (red)); or mechanical angular momentum losses: (dJ/dt)K = \u2212F\u0302\u03c6K ( hyphenated black lines),\ndJ/dt = \u2212F\u0302\u03c6 (hyphenated red lines).

As we expect (from the usual quadrupole\nformula, as well as from the well-known fact that orbital eccentricity tends to increase the flux of angular\nmomentum) that the NQC factor in the radiation reaction should be larger than one, we conclude that the \"improved\" radiation reaction expression F\u0302\u03c6 proposed in [24]\nis a physically more appealing starting point for applying\nsuch a NQC correcting factor. In addition, as, pragmatically speaking, the two types of terms parametrized by a\nand a\u2032 in Eq. (11) above behave in a roughly similar way\nduring the plunge (they are both positive and they both\nincrease), we can try, in first approximation, to use only\none of them, say the first one parametrized by a.\nIn Fig. 2 we show (as a black dotted line labelled \"Rad\nReac \u221d \u03a95 r4 with non-QC corrections\") the evolution of\n\n4\n\nNote that we can henceforth view NQC as meaning either nonquasi-circular or next-to-quasi-circular.\n\n\f6\nthe NQC-corrected radiation reaction\nF\u0302\u03c6NQC\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nRR pr\u2217\n\u2261 F\u0302\u03c6 1 + a\n(r\u03a9)2\n\n(12)\n\nwith the numerical value aRR = +2.9 (fixed by eye).

Note that, for any starting QC expression X\nthat one wishes to correct, it is in principle possible to\ncompute in General Relativity the \"real\" NQC correctNQC\ning factor fX\n, of the form (11) with some analytically\ncomputable coefficients aX , a\u2032X , etc. Note, however, that\none expects these coefficients to become (when considering PN corrections) functions of 1/r and other dynamical\nvariables. As in several other known cases, one expects\nthat these PN corrections might significantly affect the\n\"effective\" numerical value of the coefficients aX , a\u2032X ,\netc needed for a good representation of the considered\nquantity during the plunge. It would be interesting to\nhave analytic (at least 1PN-accurate) results on the co\u2032RR\nefficients aRR\nto compare them with our presently\nF , aF\n\"experimental\" estimate aRR\neffective = +2.9.\n\nB.\n\nExact waveforms\n\nLet us now consider the waveforms obtained by numerically integrating the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation\n(10), with a source corresponding to the plunging dynamics discussed above, with the F\u0302\u03c6 radiation reaction\n(we have checked that the NQC-improved radiation reaction (11) introduces only very minor changes in the waveform). For the most relevant multipolarity (l = m = 2,\nwith even parity), the resulting \"exact\" waveforms (de(exact)\n(e)\nnoted \u03a822\n, or sometimes \u03a822 ) are displayed in Fig. 3.\nThe left panel of the figure exhibits (black lines) the\n(exact)\n(norreal (top) and imaginary (bottom) part of \u03a822\nmalized as in [32]). The waveforms are extracted at\nrobs = 500 and are shown versus the (shifted) observer\nretarded time. They exhibit the usual \"chirp-like\" structure corresponding to the inspiral, and end up with the\nblack hole QNM ringing.\nThe most useful information about the dynamics of\nthe merger hidden in the (exact or analytical) waveform\ncan be extracted by inspection of the corresponding instantaneous gravitational wave frequency. Since \u03a822 is a\n\ncomplex number, this quantity is computed as\n!\n\u03a8\u030722\nM \u03c922 = \u03c9\u030222 \u2261 \u2212I\n,\n\u03a822\n\n(13)\n\nwhere I indicates the imaginary part and the overdot\nstands for d/dt. The exact \u03c9\u030222 is shown as a black solid\nline in the right panel of Fig. 3. In the same plot we\nalso include, as a blue line, twice the orbital frequency \u03a9\n(which is the zeroth-order analytical prediction coming\nfrom any \"standard quadrupole approximation\"). This\n(exact)\nplot shows that \u03c9\u030222\n\u2248 2\u03a9 during the inspiral and\nmost of the plunge (the LSO is crossed at u/(2M ) \u2243 240).\nIt is only when the (relative) radius gets quite near the\nlight-ring value r = 3 (at u/(2M ) \u2248 300, indicated\nby a green dashed vertical line) that the two frequencies start deviating from each other. While the doubled orbital frequency 2\u03a9 reaches a maximum equal to\n2\u03a9max = 0.2703 very near the light ring 5 and then exponentially decreases, the exact GW frequency \u03c9\u030222 keeps\ngrowing after the light ring until it saturates and oscillates around the fundamental QNM frequency of the\nblack hole, M \u03c9220 = 0.3736715 [34, 35]. The oscillation\nin the GW frequency around the fundamental QNM frequency is (essentially) due to the superposition of both\npositive- 6 and negative-frequency excitations in the ringdown waveform. 7 Let us mention that this kind of be(e/o)\nhavior of M \u03c9lm (odd and even-parity GW frequencies)\nis absolutely general and the amplitude of the oscillation\ndepends on m [36].\nThe fact that the amplitude of the frequency oscillation in the right panel of Fig. 3 is quite small then means\nthat the positive-frequency mode is excited with a much\nlarger coefficient than the negative-frequency one. In\nview of our general aim of understanding all the separate physical elements crucially entering the final waveform, it is interesting to explain what is the basic underlying physics behind this large dissymmetry in the excitation coefficients of the positive-frequency and negativefrequency modes (we have checked that this dissymmetry\nextends to the first few overtones above the fundamental QNM mode). Though this basic physics can be de-\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nIt is easy to see from the Hamiltonian equation (5) why this is so:\nneglecting the relatively slow variations of the angular momentum and the energy, \u03a9 vary proportionally to the ratio A(r)/r 2\nwhich is precisely the effective radial potential for photon (or\nultra-relativistic) circular orbits.\nAs in Quantum Field Theory we call positive frequency a mode\n\u221d e\u2212i\u03c9t with \u03c9 > 0. We also use for the QNMs (see below)\nthe notation \u221d e\u2212\u03c3t . In this notation, the positive frequency\nfundamental mode has \u03c30+ = \u03b10 + i\u03c90 , where \u03c90 indicates the\nfrequency and \u03b10 the damping time of the fundamental mode,\nwhile the negative frequency one has \u03c30\u2212 = \u03b10 \u2212 i\u03c90 .\nEvidently, had we initialized the dynamics with the opposite sign\nof p\u03c6 , i.e., the particle inspiralling clockwise and not counterclockwise, we would have obtained a mirror-reflected result, with\nthe negative frequency modes being more excited than the positive frequency ones.\n\n\f7\n0.4\n\n0.4\nZerilli\u2212Moncrief\nEOB\u2212type non\u2212QC F22 Pad\u00e9\n\n(e)\n\nR[\u03a822 ]/\u03bc\n\n0.2\n\nM\u03c9220=0.3736715\n\n0.35\n\n0\n0.3\n\n\u22120.2\n0.25\n\n\u22120.4\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\n380\n\n400\n\nu/(2M)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nlight ring\n\n0.15\n\n(e)\n\nI[\u03a822 ]/\u03bc\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n\n2\u03a9(exact)\n|\u03a822 |/\u03bc\nEOB\n\u03a8 |/\u03bc\n\n0.05\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\nM\u03c9(exact)\n22\nEOB\nM\u03c922\n\n22\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nu/(2M)\n\n0\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\n310\n\nu/(2M)\n\n320\n\n330\n\n340\n\n350\n\nFIG. 3: Left panel: Quadrupole waveforms (l = m = 2, even parity): exact Zerilli-type (black line) and \"matched\" improved\nEOB-type (red line).

If\nthe radial velocity is small with respect to the azimuthal\nvelocity (as is true during most of the plunge) we can\nthink of a source with an adiabatically varying frequency\nm\u03a9(t) located at the adiabatically varying radius r\u2217 (t).\nReplacing this behavior in equation (10) allows one to\napproximately replace the repeated time derivative by\nthe square of the instantaneous source frequency, i.e.\nby a factor (\u2212im\u03a9(t))2 = \u2212(m\u03a9(t))2 . This yields a\nSchroedinger-type (radial) equation with effective poten(e/o)\ntial Vl\n(r\u2217 ) \u2212 (m\u03a9(t))2 . In the upper panel of Fig. 4,\nwe compare the evolution, as a function of dynamical\ntime t, of the square roots ofqthe two contributions to\n(e/o)\n\nthis effective radial potential: Vl\n(r\u2217 (t)) and m\u03a9(t)\n( for the case l = m = 2). We see that the (m\u03a9(t))2\n(e/o)\nterm is always significantly smaller than the Vl\n(r\u2217 (t))\none. This means that during all the plunge (including at\nthe end, when \u03a9(t) reaches its maximum value), we can\nthink (in first order) in terms of a near-zone approximation, where we can neglect (2\u03a9(t))2 and compute the\nasymptotic waveform by convolving the source by a solution of the static, radial Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. One can check that this leads essentially to the\nusual (Schwarzschild-coordinate) quadrupole formula for\nthe waveform. In this approximation there is strictly no\nexcitation of the QNM modes by the adiabatically vary-\n\ning source. One therefore concludes (following the line\nof reasoning of Ref. [24] where it was explained how a\ncertain type of oscillating integral which exponentially\nvanishes in the adiabatic approximation acquired a nonzero value due to a localized non-adiabatic behavior of\nthe integrand) that the QNM modes will be excited essentially only around the maximum of the exciting frequency m\u03a9(t), because this is the moment when the\nsource excitation is non-adiabatic. Looking now at the\nbottom panel of Fig. 4, we see the trajectory of the exciting frequency on the positive real axis, from zero up\nto the maximum 2\u03a9max = 0.2703. The black dots in\nthe complex frequency plane represent the first QNM\nmodes of a Schwarzschild black hole. One understands\nintuitively (and this can be put in equations similar to\nthose derived in [24]) that the amount of excitation, by\nthe non-adiabatic behavior of the excitation frequency\nnear its maximum, of the various QNM modes will primarily depend on their \"distance\" to the critical (real)\nexciting frequency +2\u03a9max = +0.2703. This reasoning\nindicates that the QNM modes which will be primarily\nexcited are the first few positive frequency modes, i.e.\nthose appearing on the right part of the bottom panel of\nFig. 4. Summarizing in slightly different physical terms,\nwe can think of the black hole as a resonating object having the resonance spectrum showed in Fig. 4. When the\nsource varies adiabatically, so that it corresponds to a\nnearly pure frequency +m\u03a9 which is much smaller than\nany of the resonance frequencies it excites only negligibly the resonance modes. However, when the source\nvaries non-adiabatically (near its maximum frequency),\nits Fourier transform contains a halo of frequencies (due\nto non-adiabaticity) centered around the instantaneous\n\n\f8\n0.4\n(e) 1/2\n\n[V2 ]\n\n0.35\n\n2\u03a9\nM\u03c9220\nM\u03c9221\nM\u03c9\n222\nM\u03c9\n223\nM\u03c9\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n\n224\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\n310\n\n320\n\nlevel this dual description implies that one should match\ntogether (around the light ring) a plunge waveform obtained with a quadrupole-type formula to a superposition\nof black hole QNMs. This general philosophy has already\nbeen implemented, with increasing sophistication in Refs.\n[1, 3, 17, 21, 24].

The upper panel shows that, during all the plunge, one remains in a \"quasi-stationary\" nearzone regime (which does not excite QNMs). The crucial feature which can excite the QNMs is the non-adiabaticity of the\nevolution of the exciting orbital frequency near its maximum\n(similarly to Ref. [24]). The lower panel illustrates why the\n(rather short) non-adiabatic behavior of 2\u03a9(t) near its maximum preferentially excites the positive-frequency QNMs.\n\nfrequency, and this halo can now \"extend the reach\" of\n+m\u03a9max and thereby excite the black hole resonances\nwhich lie within this \"halo\" (i.e. the first few QNM\nmodes whose frequency has the same sign as +m\u03a9max ).\n\nIV.\n\nEOB-TYPE APPROXIMATE WAVEFORMS\nA.\n\nMethodology: a matched waveform\n\nLet us now turn to the construction of complete EOBtype gravitational waveforms obtained by matching an\nanalytical inspiral-plus-plunge waveform to a ring-down\none. For the reasons explained above, the crossing of the\nlight ring (actually the non adiabatic behavior around\nthe moment when \u03a9(t) reaches it maximum) corresponds\nto an abrupt triggering of the QNMs of the black hole\n(this was realized long ago [37] for the case of the radial plunge). The EOB approach takes into account this\nabrupt change in the underlying physics by an abrupt\nchange in the analytical description of the system: before the crossing of the light ring one describes the binary system as two point masses with EOB relative dynamics, while after the crossing one replaces the binary\nsystem by a single distorted black hole (as in the \"closelimit\" approximation of colliding black holes [4]). As\nwe were mentioning in the introduction, at the practical\n\nWe start by introducing here a new, improved EOBtype inspiral-plus-plunge waveform that goes beyond previous work in two directions: (i) it includes higher postNewtonian (PN) effects which are resummed in a novel\nway (factorized formulation, exact resummation of tail\neffects, 3PN-resummed non-linear PN effects), and (ii)\nit includes non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections that are\nexpected to be relevant below the LSO. Details of our\nconstruction will be explained separately [36]. Up until\nthe light ring (r >\n\u223c 3), we use a (l, m) = (2, 2) gravitational waveform defined by means of the following EOBtype improved quadrupole formula\nr\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03a8plunge\n(t)\n=\n\u22124\u03bc\n(r\u03a9) F22\n22\n30\n\u001b\n\u001a\np2\npr\n\u00d7 1 + a r\u2217 2 + ib \u2217 e\u22122i\u03c6 .\n(r\u03a9)\nr\u03a9\n\n(14)\n\nHere, F22 includes four types of PN effects, while\nthe braces represent NQC corrections. The standard\nquadrupole formula (for a point-particle source in quasicircular motion) corresponds to the case where F22 = 1\nand\np a = b = 0 (see e.g. [38]; the numerical coefficient\n\u03c0/30 corresponds to our using the Zerilli-Moncrief even\n(e)\nquantity \u03a822 ).\nThe NQC factor added above (within braces) is more\ngeneral than the general time-even NQC factor considered in (11) because we describe here non time-even NQC\neffects (as can easily be seen on the usual quadrupole formula written with two time-derivatives). The numerical\ncoefficients a and b thus parametrize non-quasi-circular\ncorrections to the modulus and to the phase of the wave.\nThey will be fixed below by comparison to the \"exact\"\nZerilli-Moncrief waveform. The novel F22 PN-improving\nfactor is given as the product of four terms\nF22 (t) = \u0124(t)T (2, 2\u03a9(t))ei\u03b422 (t) f22 (x(t)) .\n\n(15)\n\nThis factorization of PN effects is, in itself, a new way\nof partially resumming PN effects (by contrast to usual\nrepresentations of PN effects which mix the expansion\nof the four separate factors above). The first factor is\n\n\f9\nthe \"conserved\" relativistic energy of the (effective) moving source. The second factor T (2, 2\u03a9) is the particularization to l = m = 2 of a function T (l, k) (with\nM k \u2261 k\u0302 = m\u03a9) that represents a \"tail\" correction,\nnamely the contribution due to backscattering of (multipolar) waves off the background curvature. This factor\nis the exact resummation of an infinite number of \"leading logarithms\", and is derived, similarly to the work in\nRef. [39], by using Coulomb wave functions. It is explicitly given by\n\nC.\n\nRing-down waveform\n\nAfter the crossing of the light ring, the EOB approach\nconsists in replacing the two-body system by a single distorted black hole. At the level of waveforms, this means\nthat one should match, around the light ring, the plunge\nwaveform Eq. (14) to a ring-down one made of a superposition of (l = 2, m = 2) black hole QNMs, say\n\u03a8ringdown\n(t) =\n22\n\nX\nn\n\nT (l, k) =\n\n\u0393(l + 1 \u2212 2ik\u0302) \u03c0k\u0302 2ik\u0302 log(2kbscale )\ne e\n,\n\u0393(l + 1)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we shall take bscale = 2M . ei\u03b422 is an additional\nphase correction, with \u03b422 = 7\u03a9/3 to lowest PN order. The final factor f22 (x) represents the remaining\n(essentially non-linear) PN effects. Using Ref. [40] it\ncan be computed in the test-mass limit, during the inspiral, as a Taylor expansion in the PN-ordering parameter\nx = 1/r = \u03a92/3 . At 3PN 8 , it reads\n\u0014\n21428357\n536 2\n43\nx\u2212\nx + x3\n21\n189\n727650\n\u0015\n856\n1712\n428\n\u2212\n\u03b3\u2212\nlog(2) \u2212\nlog(x) , (17)\n105\n105\n105\n\nTaylor\nf22\n(x) = 1 \u2212\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.577216 . . . is the Euler constant. To improve\nits convergence properties in the strong-field-fast-motion\nregime, expression (17) is further Pad\u00e9 resummed in a\nproper way.\nWhen deriving the factor f22 (x) during the inspiral\nphase, the argument x that it depends upon is \"degenerate\" in the sense that it can be expressed in various\nways in terms of the dynamical variables of the system,\nnamely: x = v\u03c62 = (r\u03a9)2 = \u03a92/3 = 1/r. However, these\nvarious expressions start differing from each other during the plunge. This opens the issue of choosing the\n\"best\" dynamical expression for the PN-ordering argument x during the plunge, in the sense of giving the best\napproximation to the \"exact\" waveform (minimizing the\nneed for NQC corrections). We have found that choosing\nx = 1/r (the Newtonian gravitational potential) yields\ngood results, and this is the choice we shall make here.\nWe postpone to a further publication a thorough analysis of the effect of different x arguments, as well as the\ncontrast between the Pad\u00e9-resummed (that we shall use\nhere) and Taylor-expanded versions of f22 (x).\n\nWe note that for \u03bd \u226a 1 this series is known to higher PN orders.\nWe truncate it here to the 3PN level which is the highest order\nat which we could (and did) derive it in the comparable-mass\ncase. We leave to a future publication a detailed discussion of\nthe derivation of these results.\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\nCn\u2212 e\u2212\u03c3n t ,\n\n(18)\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03c3n\u00b1 = \u03b1n \u00b1 i\u03c9n are the positive/negative complex\nQNM frequencies and Cn\u00b1 are the corresponding amplitudes. Here, \u03b1n and \u03c9n indicate the damping time and\nthe oscillation frequency of each mode respectively, and\nn = 0, 1, 2, ..., N \u2212 1 labels the overtone number (n = 0\ndenoting the fundamental mode).\nIn this paper we propose an improved treatment of the\ndefinition of the ring-down waveform Eq. (18), as well as\nof the matching to the plunge waveform Eq. (14). First,\nin view of both the numerical results and the theoretical\narguments presented above, we know that the contribution of the positive-frequency modes to the waveform is\nmuch larger than that of the negative-frequency ones.\nTherefore, we can set Cn\u2212 = 0 in first approximation.\nAs a result, the instantaneous gravitational wave freEOB\nEOB\n\u2261 \u2212I(\u03a8\u0307EOB\nquency M \u03c922\n22 /\u03a822 ) of our \"matched\"\nring-down waveform will grow until it reaches a \"flat\"\nsaturation region, without oscillations. Though this is\nqualitatively slightly different from the behavior of the\nexact instantaneous frequency (see Fig. 3) we will see\nthat this gives an excellent approximation to the phasing\n(and actually a better one that if one matches to both\npositive and negative modes in a democratic way).\nOur problem is thus to determine the coefficients Cn+\nfrom the knowledge of \u03a8plunge\nfor r >\n22\n\u223c 3. Here again\nwe introduce some significant improvements on previous implementations of the EOB philosophy, based on\nthe knowledge acquired from detailed comparisons with\nour \"exact\" small-mass-ratio numerical results. A trivial improvement will consist in using a larger number N\nof QNMs (including the fundamental mode) than previous work. Instead of N = 1 [1, 3], N = 2 [24], or\nN = 3 [17, 21], we shall use here N = 5 (positivefrequency) quasi-normal modes (including the fundamental mode) [34, 35]. Our studies showed that N = 5 gives a\nsignificantly better fit than N = 4 or less, and that larger\nvalues of N yield only a rather marginal improvement.\n\nD.\n\n8\n\n+\n\nCn+ e\u2212\u03c3n t +\n\nDetermining the next-to-quasi-circular (NQC)\ncorrections to the plunge waveform.\n\nFirst of all \u03a8plunge\n, Eq. (14), has two free parameters a\n22\nand b that should be specified so to minimize the difference with the real signal. The presence of two separate\nNQC real parameters is useful because the waveform is a\n\n\f10\ncomplex number, and we wish to best fit both its modulus and its phase9 . The modulus of the numerical waveform reaches a maximum at the (shifted) retarded time\nu/(2M ) = 299.6 (i.e. just before the maximum of the\norbital frequency, or the crossing of the light ring, which\nboth occur near u/(2M ) = 300.9). We can then constrain the NQC parameters a and b so as to ensure that\nthe maximum of the modulus of the analytical waveform\n(14) sits on top of that of the exact modulus. Actually,\nwe can even do this analytically. Using the quasi-geodesic\napproximate description of the plunge, and imposing that\nthe modulus of the analytical waveform (14) is maximum\nat the light-ring gives, in first NQC approximation, the\nconstraint 2a + b2 = 1. We then get a second constraint\n(mainly on the coefficient b) by requiring that the slope\nplunge\nof the instantaneous analytical frequency M \u03c922\n(t) be\nas close as possible to the exact one M \u03c922 (t) around the\nlight ring. The two above requirements fix the values of\nthe NQC parameters to be: a = 0.438 and b = 0.355. It\nis remarkable that these two numerical values (numerically determined, by trial and error, as best eye-fitting\nvalues) do satisfy quite accurately the (first-order) analytically determined constraint mentioned above: indeed,\n2anum + b2num = 1.002. This shows the power of the EOB\napproach for building a purely analytical self-consistent\nmatched waveform, even in absence of knowledge about\nthe exact signal.\n\nE.\n\nMatching the inspiral-plus-plunge waveform to\nthe ring-down one on a \"comb\".\n\nThe last and most crucial new ingredient introduced\nhere consists in matching the plunge and ring-down waveforms on a finite time interval [tm \u2212 \u03b4/2, tm + \u03b4/2], instead of simply imposing the continuity of the two functions, and a certain number of their derivatives, at one\nmoment tmatch (as done in [1, 17, 21, 24]). We found\nthat this matching on a finite interval (chosen in the\nimmediate vicinity of light-ring crossing) was quite effective for accurately reproducing the smooth rise of\nthe instantaneous GW frequency during the whole transition. More precisely, a good choice for the matching interval [tm \u2212 \u03b4/2, tm + \u03b4/2] consists in putting its\ncenter tm at the maximum of the modulus of \u03a8plunge\n,\n22\ni.e. at t/(2M ) = 299.6, and choosing his full length\n\u03b4 = \u2206t as \u03b4/M \u2243 7.2. The matching on the interval\n[tm \u2212 \u03b4/2, tm + \u03b4/2] is most easily done by discretizing this matching interval into N (here N = 5) equally\n\n9\n\nIn view of this, a useful alternative to the a, b NQC\nfactor in braces used above, is to use instead a factorized complex NQC waveform correction of the form, (1 +\na\u2032 p2r\u2217 /(r\u03a9)2 )) exp(+ib\u2032 pr\u2217 /(r\u03a9)), in which a\u2032 affects only the\nmodulus, and b\u2032 only the phase. The (approximate) analytic\nconstraint on the modulus discussed below then becomes simply\n2a\u2032 = 1.\n\nspaced points, [t1 , t2 , . . . , tN ] (with t1 = tm \u2212 \u03b4/2 and\ntN = tm + \u03b4/2) and requiring that the two complex functions (14) and (18) coincide at these N points. This\ngives N (linear) complex equations for the N complex\nunknowns Cn+ . In other words we are using a 'matching\ncomb'.\nF.\n\nComparing analytical and numerical waveforms\n\nFinally, we define our complete EOB matched waveform (from inspiral to ring-down) as\nplunge\n\u03a8EOB\n(t)\n22 (t) \u2261 \u03b8(tm \u2212 t)\u03a822\n\n+ \u03b8(t \u2212 tm )\u03a8ringdown\n(t)\n22\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b8(t) denotes Heaviside's step function10 .\nThe left panel of Fig. 3 compares the (real and imaginary parts of the) matched EOB-type waveform (19)(red\nline) obtained by means of the matching procedure explained above, to the \"exact\" numerical one (black line).\nThe agreement between the two is clearly excellent. Note,\nin particular, how the inclusion of the novel 3PN-accurate\ncorrection factor F22 allows the analytical inspiral waveform to coincide in phase and in amplitude with the exact\nsignal. As we shall illustrate below, Newtonian-accurate\n\"restricted\" waveforms do a much poorer job: though\nthey describe the phasing rather accurately, they overestimate (already during the inspiral) the amplitude by\na significant factor. To investigate further the quality of\nthis agreement, we also plot the modulus of the waveforms and the instantaneous frequency (right panel of\nFig. 3). One sees again on this figure the very accurate\nway in which the improved EOB signal reproduces both\nthe frequency and the modulus of the exact signal during the inspiral and most of the plunge (which starts at\nu/2M \u2243 240). It is only at the end of the plunge, just before light-ring crossing, (and during ring-down) that one\nnotices a difference (smaller than about 5%) in modulus.\nTo further study the difference in frequency of the two\nsignals, we compare in Fig. 5 the time evolution of the\nphases of the two signals (with the convention \u03a8 = e\u2212i\u03c6 ,\nso that \u03c6\u0307 = +\u03c9): the matched instantaneous gravita(exact)\ntional wave phase \u03c6EOB\nversus the exact one \u03c622\n.\n22\nThese quantities are computed from time integration\nof the instantaneous frequencies from an initial time t0\nstarting with \u03c60 = 2\u03c60 where \u03c60 is the initial orbital\nphase.

We also explored\nthe sensitivity to the choice of the matching comb. For\ninstance, if we keep fixed only the center of the matching\ninterval at tm /(2M ) = 299.6, and increase \u03b4/M by a factor 2 (to \u03b4/M = 14.4) and then look for the best possible\nvalues of the parameters a and b, we find that the minimax dephasings are increased from 1.1% to about 2%.\nOn the other hand, if (still keeping fixed tm ) we decrease\n\u03b4/M to 1.8, and then look for the best possible a and b,\nwe find that the minimax dephasings are increased from\n1.1% to 2.5%. Similar sensitivities are also reached if we\nkeep fixed \u03b4/M (to the near optimal value 7.2), but move\nthe center of the interval: for example, tm /(2M ) = 298\nleads to a minimax of 2%, while tm /(2M ) = 301 gives\n4%, so that we obtain correspondingly less accurate decriptions of the waveform.\nOn the other hand, as we shall discuss in detail in a\nseparate publication, even much simplified versions of our\nmatching technique can lead to rather impressively good\nresults, notably for the phasing. To quote one particu-\n\ngw\n\ne\u2212i\u2206\u03c622 =\n\n(exact)\n\n|\n|\u03a822\n\u03a8EOB\n22\n.\n(exact) |\u03a8EOB |\n\u03a822\n22\n\n(20)\n\nAs shown in the inset of Fig. 5 there is an excellent consistency between the two methods.\nFig. 5 exhibits our most important final result: the\nmaximum phase difference, during the whole transition\nfrom inspiral to plunge, between our improved EOB signal and the exact one is of the order of \u00b11.1% of a cycle.\nNote that the ripples in the late-time part of \u2206\u03c6gw\n22 are\n(obviously) related to the absence of negative frequency\nmodes in the matched waveform.\nThis excellent analytical description of the exact waveform (phasing to \u00b11.1% of a cycle, and a rather accurate\nmodulus, see Fig. 3) was obtained by combining the several improvements to the EOB method introduced above,\nand by using the specific numerical values of the new parameters aRR , a, b, tm , \u03b4 quoted above. Note, however,\nthat there remains some flexibility in the numerical values of these parameters. We leave to future work a detailed discussion of this issue. Let us only note here that\nthe \"good choices\" of these parameters (minimizing the\n\n11\n\nWe shall refer to the minimum value of the maximum absolute\nvalue of the dephasing (over the whole inspiral-plunge-merger\nperiod) as the \"minimax\" dephasing.\n\n\f12\nlarly simple example, the standard quadrupole formula in\nthe quasi-circular approximation (in the sense of Eq. (14)\nwith F22 = 1, a = b = 0 and N = 5), still gives a quite\n<\ntiny dephasing, \u2206\u03c6gw\n22 /(2\u03c0) \u223c 2%, though the evolution\nof the modulus is less well reproduced.\nFinally, we pedagogically illustrate in Fig. 6, in a \"contrasting\" manner, the effect of the various improvements\nintroduced above by showing how the waveform comparison of Fig. 3 gets modified when not using them, but\nusing instead the type of coarser implementation of the\nEOB philosophy used in previous work [1, 3, 17, 21, 24].\nMore precisely, the EOB-type analytical waveform used\nin Fig. 6 was obtained by: (i) using (as originally proposed in Ref. [1]) the following (Newtonian-order and\nKepler-law-assuming) restricted quadrupole waveform\nr\n\u03c0 2/3 \u22122i\u03c6\nK\n\u03a8N\n(t)\n=\n\u22124\u03bc\n\u03a9 e\n,\n(21)\n22\n30\nwithout any explicit PN (F22 ) corrections, nor any NQC\n(a, b) corrections; (ii) only 3 (positive-frequency) QNMs;\nand, rather crucially, (iii) by matching the plunge and\nring-down waveforms in a very small interval (\u03b4/M = 0.9\ninstead of our preferred 7.2) around the maximum of the\norbital frequency. [Indeed, the matching of the two waveforms and their derivatives at a sharply defined moment\nis equivalent to considering the \u03b4 \u2192 0 limit of our combmatching technique]. By contrasting Fig. 6 with the right\npanel of Fig. 3 we see that: (i) the modulus of the analytical waveform is now distinctly larger than the exact\none during the inspiral (because of the lack of PN corrections); (ii) the modulus becomes significantly larger than\nthe exact one at the end of the plunge (because of the\nuse of the Kepler-law-assuming \u221d \u03a92/3 , which, as pointed\nout in [24] tends to overestimate the amplitude); (iii) the\npost-matching analytical frequency jumps up from the\n(doubled) maximum orbital frequency significantly more\nvertically than before, thereby decoupling too soon from\nthe exact frequency, and accruing a larger dephasing than\nbefore (because of the too localized matching, and \u2013 to a\nlesser degree \u2013 the use of only 3 QNMs). Note, however\nthat (as exhibited in the inset) this \"coarser\" EOB-type\nimplementation still succeeds in following the phase of\nthe exact signal to a rather impressive \u00b13.5% of a cycle.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a first attack on the problem\nof computing analytic template waveforms, describing\nthe complete binary black hole coalescence phenomenon\n(from early inspiral to late ring-down) that are both effectual and faithful (in the terminology of Ref. [20]). We\nhave restricted our analysis to the small-mass-ratio limit\nwithout spin, a problem that is amenable of a seminumerical investigation based on a synergic use of black\n\nhole perturbation theory and PN-based EOB results [26].\nOur analytic approach is based on the Effective One\nBody (EOB) method [1, 2, 22, 23, 24]. The current\nimplementations [1, 3, 17, 21, 24] of this method have\nbeen recently shown [17] to define effectual templates\nfor the coalescence of comparable-mass (non-spinning)\nsystems in the full mass range of interest for groundbased GW detectors. Our aim is to improve the implementation of the EOB method so as to construct highaccuracy, faithful templates. Our strategy towards this\naim is to understand, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, by comparing generalized, multi-parameter EOB-based waveforms to \"exact\"\nwaveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches.\nIn this first paper, we have tapped the information contained in small-mass-ratio waveforms, which can rather\neasily be computed very fast and with high-accuracy.\nOur main achievements are: (i) a better description\nof radiation reaction during the plunge (by taking into\naccount non-quasi-circular effects); (ii) a refined analytical expression for the (l, m) = (2, 2) waveform (which\nincludes a resummation of tail effects, a 3PN-accurate\n\"non-linear\" amplitude correction, and the inclusion of\nnon-quasi-circular corrections); (iii) an improved technique for matching the plunge and ring-down waveforms\n(which is based on an improved understanding of the\nphysical elements entering this matching: origin of the\nexcitation of quasi-normal modes, sign of their frequencies, use of an extended matching interval). The implementation of these improvements has led us to the explicit computation of EOB-type analytic waveforms that\naccurately reproduce (both in its phase and its amplitude) the exact waveform during the whole transition.\nIn particular, the phase difference stays within \u00b11.1% of\na cycle. Such a good result in the small mass-ratio case\nrises the hope that a comparably good agreement could\nalso be achieved in the comparable-mass case. This will\nbe the object of future work [41].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank E. Berti and A. Buonanno for assistance during the conception of this work; R. De Pietri\nand L.
