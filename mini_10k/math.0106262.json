In this note , we answer positively a question by Belegradek and Kapovitch[2] about the relation between rational homotopy theory and a problem in Riemannian geometry which asks\nthat total spaces of which vector bundles over compact nonnegative curved manifolds admit (complete) metrics with nonnegative\ncurvature.\n\n1. Introduction\nGiven a Riemannian manifold M with metric\n<>: T M \u00d7 T M \u2192 T M\nan affine connection is a bilinear map\n\u2207 : V ec(M) \u00d7 V ec(M) \u2192 V ec(M)\nwhich satisfies the following\n\u2022 \u2207 f V W = f \u2207V W\n\u2022 \u2207V (f W ) = (V f )W + f \u2207V W\nwhere f \u2208 C \u221e (M), V, W \u2208 V ec(M)\nAn affine connection is called Levi-Civita connection if it satisfies\nalso the following\n\u2022 X < V, W >=< \u2207X V, W > + < V, \u2207X W >\n\u2022 \u2207V (W ) \u2212 \u2207W V \u2212 [V, W ] = 0\nwhere [V, W ]f = (XY \u2212 Y X)f is the Lie bracket.\nA fundamental result in Riemannian geometry asserts that\nDate: Aug. 30, 2001.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C20 53C40 55P10.\nKey words and phrases. curvature, derivation, homotopy equivalence.\nThe first author is partially supported by the NSFC projects 10071087 , 19701032\nand ZD9603 of Chinese Academy of Science .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJIANZHONG PAN\n\nTheorem 1.1. For each Riemannian metric, there exists a unique\nLevi-Civita connection.\nGiven a Riemannian manifold M with Levi-Civita connection , there\nis defined a curvature operator\nR : V ec(M) \u00d7 V ec(M) \u00d7 V ec(M) \u2192 V ec(M)\ndefined by\nR(X, Y )Z = \u2207X \u2207Y Z \u2212 \u2207Y \u2207X Z \u2212 \u2207[X,Y ]Z\nFrom it one arrives at an important geometric invariant which is called\nSectional curvature defined by\nK(\u03c3) =\n\n< R(v, w)w, v >\n< v \u2227 w, v \u2227 w >\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2282 Tp M is a tangent plane at p \u2208 M and v, w \u2208 \u03c3 span it.\nIt is well known that K(\u03c3) does not depend on the choice of spanning\nvectors.\nA well known question in Riemannian geometry is\nQuestion 1.2. Does the restriction on curvature imply the restriction\non topology and vice versa?\nIn particular, how does the positive(nonnegative) curvature restrict\nthe topology of the underlining manifold?\nA Riemannian manifold is called positively (or nonnegatively) curved\nif, for any \u03c3, K(\u03c3) > 0 (or K(\u03c3) \u2265 0).\nFor compact manifold, we have the following classical\nTheorem 1.3. Let M be\ntive curvature. Then\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 finite group\n\u03c01 (M) =\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 Z\n2\n\na compact Riemannian manifold with posiif dim M is odd\nif dim M is even and M is orientable\nif dim M is even and M is nonorientable\n\nThe main concern of this note is on noncompact manifold. In this\ncase there is the following\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY AND NONNEGATIVE CURVATURE\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.4. Let M be a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative curvature. Then M is diffeomorphic to the total\nspace of the normal bundle of a compact totally geodesic submanifold\nwhich is called the soul.\nAnother central question in Riemannian geometry is to what extent\nthe converse is true, or in other words\nQuestion 1.5. Total spaces of which vector bundles over compact nonnegatively curved manifolds admit (complete) metrics with nonnegative\ncurvature?\nPreviously, obstructions to the existence of nonnegatively curved\nmetrics on vector bundles were only known for a flat soul [7]. No\nobstructions are known when the soul is simply-connected. In [2] an\napproach to the reduction of the problem to the vector bundle over\nsimply connected manifold was initiated. The start point is another\nresult of Cheeger and Gromoll [4] that a finite cover of any closed nonnegatively curved manifold (throughout the paper by a nonnegatively\ncurved manifold we mean a complete Riemannian manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature) is diffeomorphic to a product of a torus and\na simply-connected closed nonnegatively curved manifold. It turns out\nthat a similar statement holds for open complete nonnegatively curved\nmanifolds which is the basis of their analysis.\nLemma 1.6. [2] Let (N, g) be a complete nonnegatively curved manifold. Then there exists a finite cover N \u2032 of N diffeomorphic to a product\nM \u00d7 T k where M is a complete open simply connected nonnegatively\ncurved manifold. Moreover, if S \u2032 is a soul of N \u2032 , then this diffeomorphism can be chosen in such a way that it takes S \u2032 onto C \u00d7 T k where\nC is a soul of M.\nBy using this and characteristic classes technique, they proved that,\nin various case, the total spaces of rank k vector bundles over C \u00d7\nT admit no nonnegatively curved metric if they do not become the\npullback of a bundle over C in a finite cover. The following is such an\nexample\n\n\f4\n\nJIANZHONG PAN\n\nCorollary 1.7. [1] Let B be a closed nonnegatively curved manifold. If\n\u03c01 (B) contains a free abelian subgroup of rank four (two, respectively),\nthen for each k \u2265 2 (for k = 2, respectively) there exists a finite cover\nof B over which there exist infinitely many rank k vector bundles whose\ntotal spaces admit no nonnegatively curved metrics.\nBelegradek and Kapovitch [2] are thus lead to the following\nDefinition 1.8. Given a closed smooth simply connected manifold C,\na torus T , and a positive integer k, we say that a triple (C, T, k) is\nsplitting rigid if any rank k vector bundle over C \u00d7T with nonnegatively\ncurved total space splits, after passing to a finite cover, as the product\nof a rank k bundle over C and a rank zero bundle over T .\nLet H be the class of simply-connected CW-complexes whose rational\ncohomology algebra is finite dimensional, as a rational vector space, and\nhas no nonzero derivations of negative degree(see [2] for the reason to\nchoose such a class H). For example, H contains any compact simplyconnected K\u00e4hler manifold [6].\nA natural question is\nQuestion 1.9. [2] Let C \u2208 H be a closed smooth manifold. Is (C, T, k)\nsplitting rigid for any T and k?\nThe main result in this note is a positive answer to this question\nTheorem 1.10. Let C \u2208 H be a closed smooth manifold. Then (C, T, k)\nis splitting rigid for any T and k.\nIn this paper, all (co)homology groups have rational coefficients, all\nmanifolds and vector bundles are smooth; all topological spaces are\nhomotopy equivalent to connected CW-complexes. [X, Y ] will be the\nbased homotopy classes of based maps between them. map(X, Y ) is\nthe space of maps from X to Y and map(X, Y )f is the connected\ncomponent of map(X, Y ) which contains the map f : X \u2192 Y .\n2. A splitting criterion\nGiven a finite cell complex C, define Char(k, C) to be the subspace\n[(k\u22121)/2] 4i\nof H \u2217 (C) which is the direct sum of \u2295i=1\nH (C) and the subspace\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY AND NONNEGATIVE CURVATURE\n\n5\n\nequal to H k (C) if k is even, and to H 4[k/2] (C) if k is odd. Note that\nany rational characteristic class of a rank k vector bundle over C lies\nin the subalgebra of H \u2217 (C) generated by Char(k, C).\nBelegradek and Kapovitch transform the problem of a triple (C, T, k)\nbeing splitting rigid into a homotopy problem as follows\nProposition 2.1. [2] Let C be a closed simply-connected manifold, T\nbe a torus, k be a positive integer. If any self-homotopy equivalence of\nC \u00d7 T maps Char(k, C) to itself, then the triple (C, T, k) is splitting\nrigid.\nWe are thus led to compute the group of homotopy classes of self\nhomotopy equivalences Aut(C \u00d7 T ) of C \u00d7 T .\nBefore we can do this , let's recall a work by Booth and Heath [3]\nGiven spaces with base point (X, x0 ) and (Y, y0 ), there is a natural\nmap\n\u03c6 : map(X \u00d7 Y, X \u00d7 Y ) \u2192 map(X, X) \u00d7 map(Y, Y )\ndefined by \u03c6(f ) = (g, h) where g(x) = \u03c0X \u25e6f (x, y0 ) , h(y) = \u03c0Y \u25e6f (x0 , y)\nand \u03c0X : X \u00d7 X, \u03c0Y : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y are projections to the factors X and\nY respectively.\nDefinition 2.2. Let X and Y be two spaces . We say X and Y have\nthe induced equivalence property(IEP) if whenever f is a homotopy\nequivalence , then g, h defined above are homotopy equivalences.\nRemark 2.3. Let X and Y be such that for each i > 0, at least one\nof \u03c0i (X) and \u03c0i (Y ) is zero. Then they satisfy the IEP by Whitehead\ntheorem.\nWith the above notion, we can quote the following\nTheorem 2.4. Let X and Y be two spaces having IEP. Suppose further that [X, map(Y, Y )id ] = 0, then there is a short exact sequence of\ngroups and homomorphisms\n\u03b8\n\n1 \u2192 [Y, map(X, X)id ] \u2192 Aut(X \u00d7 Y ) \u2192 Aut(X) \u00d7 Aut(Y ) \u2192 1\nwhich splits by a homomorphism \u03c3 : Aut(X) \u00d7 Aut(Y ) \u2192 Aut(X \u00d7 Y )\ngiven by \u03c3(g, h) = g \u00d7 h\n\n\f6\n\nJIANZHONG PAN\n\nLet X = C and Y = T where C, T be as in Theorem1.10. Then X\nand Y have IEP by the remark following the definition2.2. On the other\nhand, [C, map(T, T )id] = 0 since it is well known that map(T, T )id = T\nand C is 1-connected and thus first cohomology of C is trivial.\nNow given f \u2208 Aut(C \u00d7 T ) , to prove that the induced homomorphism in cohomology maps Char(k, C) to itself , it suffices to\nassume that f \u2208 Im([T, map(C, C)id ]) by the exact sequence above.\nRecall that the map \u03b8 : [T, map(C, C)id ] \u2192 Aut(C \u00d7 T ) is given by\n\u03b8(f )(x, y) = (f (y)(x), y). The above argument gives the following\nCorollary 2.5. Let C be a closed simply-connected manifold, T be a\ntorus, k be a positive integer. Then the triple (C, T, k) is splitting rigid\nif, for any map f : T \u2192 map(C, C)id , the adjoint f \u0303 : T \u00d7 C \u2192 C\ninduces a homomorphism in cohomology given by f \u0303\u2217 (u) = 1 \u2297 u for\nany u \u2208 H \u2217 (C) .\n3. The proof of Theorem1.10\nProof of Theorem1.10. Let T = (S 1 )s . By Corollary 2.5, to prove Theorem1.10 , it suffices to prove that , for map f : T \u00d7 C \u2192 C such that\nf (y0, \u2212) homotopic to id, it induces a homomorphism in cohomology\ngiven by f \u2217 (u) = 1 \u2297 u. Given such f , for any u \u2208 H \u2217(C),\nXX\n\u03bbi1 ***ik (u) \u2297 \u03b9i1 * * * \u03b9ik\nf \u2217 (u) = 1 \u2297 u +\nk i1 ***ik\n\nwhere the first sum is taken over k from 1 to s and the second sum is\ntaken over all (i1 * * * ik )\u2032 s such that 0 < i1 < * * * < ik < s + 1. Thus we\nget a sequence of maps \u03bbi1 ***ik : H n (C) \u2192 H n\u2212k (C) where 0 < k < s + 1\nand 0 < i1 < * * * < ik < s + 1.\nTo prove that f \u2217 (u) = 1 \u2297 u , it suffices to prove that \u03bbi1 ***ik = 0\nwhere 0 < k < s + 1 and 0 < i1 < * * * < ik < s + 1 while for the proof\nof later we need to study the behaviour of these maps with respect to\nthe cup product of cohomology.\nIf u, v \u2208 H \u2217 (C) , then\nXX\nf \u2217 (uv) = 1 \u2297 uv +\n\u03bbi1 ***ik (uv) \u2297 \u03b9i1 * * * \u03b9ik\nk i1 ***ik\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY AND NONNEGATIVE CURVATURE\n\n7\n\nOn the other hand f \u2217 (uv) = f \u2217 (u)f \u2217(v). Using the formula for\nf \u2217 (uv), f \u2217(u), f \u2217(v) and comparing the terms associated with \u03b9i1 * * * \u03b9ik ,\nwe find the following equations\nX\n\u03bbi1 ***ik (uv) = \u03bbi1 ***ik (u)v + (\u22121)k|v| u\u03bbi1 ***ik (v) \u00b1\n\u03bbj1 ***jp (u)\u03bbl1 ***lq (v) \u2297 \u03b9i1 * * * \u03b9ik\nwhere p + q = k with p > 0, q > 0 and the sum is taken over all\npartitions of i1 , * * * , ik into j1 < * * * < jp and l1 < * * * < jq .\nLet k = 1. Then then above formula implies that \u03bbi1 is a derivation\nof degree \u22121 which is trivial by the condition of the Theorem1.10. The\nabove formula in case k = 2 implies that \u03bbi1 i2 is a derivation of degree\n\u22122 modulo products of derivations of degree \u22121 which are trivial. It\nfollows that \u03bbi1 i2 is a derivation of degree \u22122 and thus is trivial by the\ncondition of the Theorem1.10. Inductively we can prove that all \u03bbi1 ***ik\nare trivial which completes the proof of the Theorem1.10.\n---------------------References\n[1] I. Belegradek and V.
