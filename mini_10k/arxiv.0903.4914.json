We introduce the nuclear dimension of a C \u2217 -algebra; this is a\nnoncommutative version of topological covering dimension based on a modification of the earlier concept of decomposition rank. Our notion behaves\nwell with respect to inductive limits, tensor products, hereditary subalgebras\n(hence ideals), quotients, and even extensions. It can be computed for many\nexamples; in particular, it is finite for all UCT Kirchberg algebras. In fact,\nall classes of nuclear C \u2217 -algebras which have so far been successfully classified consist of examples with finite nuclear dimension, and it turns out that\nfinite nuclear dimension implies many properties relevant for the classification\nprogram. Surprisingly, the concept is also linked to coarse geometry, since\nfor a discrete metric space of bounded geometry the nuclear dimension of the\nassociated uniform Roe algebra is dominated by the asymptotic dimension of\nthe underlying space.\n\nIntroduction\nRecent developments in noncommutative topology suggest that dimension type\nconditions play a crucial role for the understanding of noncommutative spaces and\ntheir applications, cf. [7], [36], [39], [5] and [6]. While in the commutative case the\nvarious definitions of covering dimension tend to coincide (at least for sufficiently\nwell-behaved spaces), their generalizations to the noncommutative situation yield\nvastly different notions, such as stable rank, real rank, or decomposition rank (cf.\n[21], [4], [16]), each of which has turned out to be highly useful and interesting in its\nown right. The known applications, e.g. to the classification of nuclear C \u2217 -algebras,\nare all limited to somewhat special situations \u2013 although, from a philosophical point\nof view, it should be possible to handle many of these in a unified manner. There\nare also notions which have not yet been generalized to the noncommutative setting,\nsuch as Gromov's asymptotic dimension (and the latter should clearly be accessible\nfrom a noncommutative point of view, as it has already been shown to be closely\nrelated to the coarse Baum\u2013Connes conjecture).\nThe present paper seeks to remedy this situation. We will propose a notion\nof noncommutative covering dimension which on the one hand is flexible enough\nto cover large classes of (nuclear) C \u2217 -algebras, and which on the other hand is\nintimately related to many other regularity properties of noncommutative spaces.\nThe concept is linked to the classification program for nuclear C \u2217 -algebras, as well\nas to the theory of dynamical systems and to coarse geometry. We hope that it\nwill contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between these fields,\nDate: October 29, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L05, 46L85.\nKey words and phrases. noncommutative covering dimension, classification of C \u2217 -algebras,\napproximation properties, asymptotic dimension.\nSupported by: EPSRC First Grant EP/G014019/1.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\nbut also shed new light on the role of dimension type conditions in other areas of\nnoncommutative geometry.\nOur nuclear dimension is seemingly only a small variation of the decomposition\nrank, a notion introduced by Kirchberg and the first named author in [16] (this in\nturn was based on earlier concepts introduced in [30] and [31]). The decomposition\nrank models the dimension type condition in terms of a decomposition property\nof noncommutative partitions of unity. Nuclear dimension is defined in a similar\nmanner, only now we add a little more flexibility to the partitions of unity under\nconsideration. The outcome is a notion of integer valued covering dimension for\nnuclear C \u2217 -algebras, which still coincides with covering dimension of the spectrum\nin the commutative case, and which still has nice permanence properties. But\nnow, the added flexibility in the choice of the partitions of unity makes the theory\naccessible to much larger classes of C \u2217 -algebras.\nThe decompostion rank has turned out to be extremely useful for the classification of stably finite, separable, simple, nuclear C \u2217 -algebras. In fact, all classes\nof such C \u2217 -algebras which by now have been classified consist of ones with finite\ndecomposition rank \u2013 and it seems well possible that separable simple C \u2217 -algebras\nwith finite decomposition rank are entirely classifiable by their K-theory data. An\nimportant step in this direction was achieved in [34], where it was shown that, for\nseparable, simple, unital C \u2217 -algebras, finite decomposition rank implies Z-stability,\ni.e., all such C \u2217 -algebras absorb the Jiang\u2013Su algebra Z tensorially. (The Jiang\u2013\nSu algebra was introduced in [11]; see [25] for alternative characterizations.) The\ndecomposition rank can take finite values only for quasidiagonal C \u2217 -algebras, so its\nuse beyond the stably finite case of the classification program will be limited. On\nthe other hand, Kirchberg and Phillips have very successfully classified purely infinite simple C \u2217 -algebras. Although in their initial approach, topological dimension\ntype conditions do not show up explicitly, these nontheless have turned out to be\nimportant both in the simple and the nonsimple case, cf. [14], [2]. We will show that\nthe C \u2217 -algebras covered by Kirchberg\u2013Phillips classification all have finite nuclear\ndimension, so that our theory covers large parts of the classification program, both\nin the stably finite and in the purely infinite case. In fact, one of our motivations\nis to make progress on a unified approach to the classification problem for nuclear\nC \u2217 -algebras, i.e., an approach that does not require genuinely different methods in\nthe finite and the infinite case.\nWe have already mentioned that, in the simple and unital case, finite decomposition rank implies Z-stability. Using results of Kirchberg, we will be able to derive an\ninfinite version of this statement, namely, that a separable simple C \u2217 -algebra with\nfinite nuclear dimension and no nontrivial trace is purely infinite, hence absorbs\nthe Cuntz algebra O\u221e . As of this moment, we do not know whether simplicity\nand finite nuclear dimension will imply Z-stability in general; however, there are\npromising results pointing in this direction, see [20] (where the corona factorization\nproperty is confirmed for simple, unital C \u2217 -algebras with finite nuclear dimension)\nand Remark 5.5; cf. also Conjecture 9.3 below.\nA natural touchstone for any kind of invariant for C \u2217 -algebras will be its behavior\nwith respect to standard constructions, such as direct sums, limits, tensor products, quotients, ideals, or hereditary subalgebras. Decomposition rank and nuclear\ndimension behave equally well in this respect. There is, however, one exception:\nsince finite decomposition rank implies finiteness, the Toeplitz extension shows that\n\n\fTHE NUCLEAR DIMENSION OF C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nfinite decomposition rank does not pass from quotients and ideals to extensions in\ngeneral \u2013 a problem circumvented by the additional flexibility of nuclear dimension.\nThe situation for crossed products is more subtle. At this point, we only have\npartial results about the topological dimension of crossed products; for example, it\nis known that the transformation group C \u2217 -algebra of a minimal diffeomorphism\non a compact smooth manifold has finite decomposition rank \u2013 and the proof is\nextremely technical, cf. [18] and [32]. In [29], Toms and the first named author will\nshow that the transformation group C \u2217 -algebra of a minimal homeomorphism on\nan infinite, compact, finite dimensional, metrizable space has finite nuclear dimension \u2013 and this time, the proof is much simpler and more conceptual. (Even more,\nthe methods introduced in this context are an important step towards completing\nthe classification of C \u2217 -algebras associated to uniquely ergodic, minimal homeomorphisms on infinite, compact, finite dimensional, metrizable spaces, as achieved\nin [29]; see also [27].)\nAnother natural situation to consider is when a group satisfies certain geometric\ndimension type conditions. Here, we face a genuine problem since the (full or\nreduced) group C \u2217 -algebra will in general not be nuclear. However, one might as\nwell look at the so-called uniform Roe algebra; it then turns out that if a discrete\ngroup (with word length metric) has finite asymptotic dimension in the sense of\nGromov, then its uniform Roe algebra has finite nuclear dimension. This statement\ncan be generalized to discrete metric spaces of bounded geometry. At this point\nit is an open question how much information about the underlying space the Roe\nalgebra actually contains. It will be interesting to approach this question in our\ncontext, i.e., analyze what finite nuclear dimension of the Roe algebra means for the\nunderlying space. The problem is particularly relevant since Yu (in [39]) has shown\nthat a group with finite asymptotic dimension satisfies the coarse Baum\u2013Connes\nconjecture. By now, we know that the latter also holds in more general situations,\nso one might ask whether finite nuclear dimension of the Roe algebra is a strong\nenough regularity property to ensure the coarse Baum\u2013Connes conjecture of the\nunderlying group.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some facts about\norder zero maps and completely positive approximations of nuclear C \u2217 -algebras. In\nSection 2 we introduce our nuclear dimension, compare it to the decomposition rank\nand derive its permanence properties with respect to inductive limits, quotients,\nideals, extensions and hereditary subalgebras. Section 3 provides a technical result\non the special structure of completely positive approximations realizing nuclear\ndimension; namely, we prove that the outgoing maps can always be chosen to be\napproximately order zero. We compare nuclear dimension to Kirchberg's covering\nnumber in Section 4. These observations together with a result of Kirchberg are\nused in Section 5 to obtain a dichotomy result on sufficiently noncommutative C \u2217 algebras with finite nuclear dimension: they either have a nontrivial trace or are\npurely infinite. In Section 6 we collect a number of examples both with finite and\nwith infinite nuclear dimension. This list is extended in Sections 7 and 8, where\nwe show that Kirchberg algebras satisfying the Universal Coefficient Theorem have\nfinite nuclear dimension, and that, for a discrete countable metric space of bounded\ngeometry, the nuclear dimension of the associated uniform Roe algebra is dominated\nby the asymptotic dimension of the space. We close with a number of open problems\nand possible future developments in Section 9.\n\n\f4\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\n1. Order zero maps\nIn this section we recall some facts about order zero maps. These are c.p. maps preserving orthogonality; they are particularly well-behaved, and will serve as building\nblocks of our noncommutative partitions of unity, similar as in [30], [31] and [16].\nDefinition 1.1. Let A and B be C \u2217 -algebras, and \u03c6 : A \u2192 B a c.p. map. We say\n\u03c6 has order zero, if, for a, b \u2208 A+ ,\na \u22a5 b \u21d2 \u03c6(a) \u22a5 \u03c6(b).\nThe following structure theorem for order zero maps was derived in [37] (based\non results from [38], and generalizing [33, 1.2], which only covers the case of finitedimensional domains).\nTheorem 1.2. Let A and B be C \u2217 -algebras and \u03c6 : A \u2192 B a c.p. order zero map.\nLet C := C \u2217 (\u03c6(A)) \u2282 B, then there is a positive element h \u2208 M(C) \u2229 C \u2032 with\nkhk = k\u03c6k and a \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c0\u03c6 : A \u2192 M(C) \u2229 {h}\u2032 \u2282 B \u2217\u2217\nsuch that\n\u03c0\u03c6 (a)h = \u03c6(a) for a \u2208 A.\nIf A is unital, then h = \u03c6(1A ) \u2208 C.\nIn the situation of the preceding theorem, we call \u03c0\u03c6 the canonical supporting\n\u2217-homomorphism of \u03c6.\nWe shall have use for the following easy consequence of Theorem 1.2, cf. [37].\nCorollary 1.3. Let A, B be C \u2217 -algebras and \u03c8 : A \u2192 B a c.p.c. order zero map.\nIf \u03c4 is a positive tracial functional on B, then \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c8 is a positive tracial functional\non A.\nBy [31, 1.2.3], order zero maps with finite-dimensional domains can be described\nin terms of generators and relations which are weakly stable in the sense of [19]. The\nfollowing is a straightforward reformulation of [16, Proposition 2.5] in this context.\nProposition 1.4. Let F be a finite dimensional C \u2217 -algebra. For any \u03b7 > 0 there\nis \u03b4 > 0 such that the following holds: If A is a C \u2217 -algebra and \u03c6 : F \u2192 A a c.p.c.\norder zero map, and if d \u2208 A+ is a positive contraction in the unitization of A\nsatisfying k[d, \u03c6(x)]k \u2264 \u03b4kxk for all x \u2208 F , then there is a c.p.c. order zero map\n1\n1\n\u03c6\u0302 : F \u2192 A such that k\u03c6\u0302(x) \u2212 d 2 \u03c6(x)d 2 k \u2264 \u03b7kxk for all x \u2208 F .\n2. Nuclear dimension\nBelow we define our notion of noncommutative dimension, compare it to other\nconcepts such as topological covering dimension or decomposition rank, and derive\nits most important permanence properties.\nDefinition 2.1. A C \u2217 -algebra A has nuclear dimension at most n, if there exists a\nnet (F\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b such that the F\u03bb are finite-dimensional C \u2217 -algebras, and such\nthat \u03c8\u03bb : A \u2192 F\u03bb and \u03c6\u03bb : F\u03bb \u2192 A are completely positive maps satisfying\n(i) \u03c8\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c6\u03bb (a) \u2192 a uniformly on finite subsets of A;\n(ii) k\u03c8\u03bb k \u2264 1;\n\n\fTHE NUCLEAR DIMENSION OF C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\n(0)\n\n(n)\n\n(iii) for each \u03bb, F\u03bb decomposes into n + 1 ideals F\u03bb = F\u03bb \u2295 . . . \u2295 F\u03bb\nthat \u03c6\u03bb |F (i) is a c.p.c. order zero map for i = 0, 1, . . . , n.\n\nsuch\n\n\u03bb\n\nWe write dimnuc A \u2264 n in this case and refer to the maps \u03c6\u03bb as piecewise contractive\nn-decomposable c.p. maps, and to the triples (F\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb ) as piecewise contractive\nn-decomposable c.p. approximations.\nRemarks 2.2. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra.\n(i) If dimnuc A \u2264 n < \u221e, there is a system (F\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb )\u039b of piecewise contractive n-decomposable c.p. approximations for A; since each map \u03c6\u03bb is\na sum of at most n + 1 c.p.c. maps, and since the \u03c8\u03bb are c.p.c. maps,\nthe norms of the compositions \u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb are uniformly bounded by n + 1. It\nis straightforward to check that this implies that A has the completely\npositive approximation property, so that A is nuclear.\n(ii) Recall from [16] that the decomposition rank is defined almost exactly as\nthe nuclear dimension, with only the \u2013 seemingly small \u2013 extra condition\nthat the maps \u03c6\u03bb themselves are contractive. It is therefore trivial that\ndimnuc A \u2264 dr A.\n(iii) It is also trivial that dimnuc A = 0 iff dr A = 0. Moreover, this happens iff\nA is an AF algebra (cf. [16, Example 4.1]).\n(iv) We will see later that nuclear dimension and decomposition rank in general\ndo not coincide, so that we cannot generally choose the maps \u03c8\u03bb and \u03c6\u03bb\nin the approximations (F\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb )\u039b of 2.1 to be contractive. We can,\nhowever, always modify the approximations such that the compositions\n\u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb are indeed contractions. If A is unital, then \u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb (1A ) \u2192 1A , so\nit will suffice to replace \u03c6\u03bb by k\u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb (1A )k\u22121 * \u03c6\u03bb . In the nonunital case\nchoose an approximate unit (u\u03c3 )\u03a3 for A, and replace the net \u039b by the\n1\n\n1\n\ndouble-indexed net \u039b \u00d7 \u03a3, the maps \u03c8\u03bb by \u03c8\u03bb,\u03c3 := \u03c8\u03bb (u\u03c32 . u\u03c32 ) and the\nmaps \u03c6\u03bb by \u03c6\u03bb,\u03c3 := k\u03c6\u03bb \u03c8\u03bb (u\u03c3 )k\u22121 *\u03c6\u03bb . It is then straightforward to check\nthat these new approximations still form a system of piecewise contractive,\nn-decomposable c.p. approximations with the additional property that the\ncompositions \u03c6\u03bb,\u03c3 \u03c8\u03bb,\u03c3 are contractions.\n(v) Note that we did not ask A to be separable in Definition 2.1. While [16,\nDefinition 3.1] was formulated only for separable C \u2217 -algebras, it clearly\nmakes sense in the general situation as well; moreover, several of the basic\nresults of [16] still hold in the nonseparable case. In the present paper,\nwe did not want to make any restrictions along these lines, since some\nof our main examples will be nonseparable (cf. Section 8). However, for\nmany applications one can nontheless restrict to the separable case, cf.\nProposition 2.6 below.\nThe following permanence properties are derived just as for the completely positive rank or for the decomposition rank, cf. [30, Section 3] and [16, Section 3]. Note\nthat there is no need to specify the tensor product in 2.3(ii), since the values can\nbe finite only for nuclear C \u2217 -algebras.\nProposition 2.3. Let A, B, C, D and E be C \u2217 -algebras; suppose C = lim\u2192 Ci is\nan inductive limit of C \u2217 -algebras and D is a quotient of E. Then,\n(i) dimnuc (A \u2295 B) = max(dimnuc A, dimnuc B)\n\n\f6\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\n(ii) dimnuc (A \u2297 B) \u2264 (dimnuc A + 1)(dimnuc B + 1) \u2212 1; if B is an AF algebra,\nthen dimnuc (A \u2297 B) \u2264 dimnuc A\n(iii) dimnuc C \u2264 lim inf(dimnuc Ci )\n(iv) dimnuc D \u2264 dimnuc E.\nJust as the decomposition rank, nuclear dimension agrees with covering dimension of the spectrum in the separable commutative case. In the nonseparable case,\nnuclear dimension and decomposition rank still coincide, and they agree with the\nrespective definition of covering dimension. The only reason why we distinguish between the separable and the nonseparable case is that the various characterizations\nof dimension tend to disagree for spaces which are not second countable.\nProposition 2.4. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Then,\ndimnuc C0 (X) = dr C0 (X).\nIn particular, if X is second countable, we have\ndimnuc C0 (X) = dr C0 (X) = dim X.\nProof. We have dimnuc C0 (X) \u2264 dr C0 (X) by Remark 2.2. For the reverse estimate,\nlet us assume that dimnuc C0 (X) = n < \u221e. Suppose F \u2282 C0 (X) is a finite subset\nof positive normalized elements, and that \u03b5 > 0 is given. We may assume that\nthe elements of F have compact support and that there is a positive normalized\nfunction h \u2208 C0 (X) such that ha = a for all a \u2208 F .\nChoose a piecewise contractive n-decomposable c.p. approximation (F = F (0) \u2295\n. . . \u2295 F (n) , \u03c8, \u03c6) for F \u222a {h} within \u03b5/2. Since \u03c6 has order zero on each matrix\nblock of F , we see from [30, Remark 2.16(ii)] that F is commutative. By cutting\ndown F to the hereditary subalgebra generated by \u03c8(h), we may assume that \u03c8(h)\nis invertible in F . Define c.p. maps\n\u03c8\u0302 : C0 (X) \u2192 F and \u03c6\u0302 : F \u2192 C0 (X)\nby\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c8\u0302(f ) := \u03c8(h)\u2212 2 \u03c8(hf )\u03c8(h)\u2212 2 for f \u2208 C0 (X)\nand\n\n\u0010\n1\n1\n\u03b5\u0011\n* \u03c6(\u03c8(h) 2 x\u03c8(h) 2 ) for x \u2208 F.\n\u03c6\u0302(x) := 1 \u2212\n2\nIt is clear that \u03c8\u0302 is contractive, and that \u03c6\u0302 is n-decomposable with respect to\nF = F (0) \u2295 . . . \u2295 F (n) .

Kirchberg's covering number\nIn [14, Definition 3.1], Kirchberg introduced a new integer valued invariant for a\nunital C \u2217 -algebra.

It does not directly generalize topological covering\ndimension though, since it measures how many order zero maps one needs to cover\na noncommutative space, as opposed to approximating it. In this section we recall\nthe definition and some facts from [14], and then compare the covering number to\nnuclear dimension.\nDefinition 4.1. Let A be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and n \u2208 N.

If \u03c4 is a bounded nontrivial trace on B, then there is a (possibly unbounded) nontrivial l.s.c. trace \u03c4 \u2032 on A.\nProof. Let J \u2701 A be the (closed) ideal generated by B. By Brown's Theorem ([3,\nTheorem 2.8]), B \u2297 K \u223c\n= J \u2297 K, since B is full in J.\nLet Tr denote the standard l.s.c. trace on K, then \u03c4 \u2297 Tr yields a densely defined\nnontrivial l.s.c. trace on J \u2297K. Let \u03c4\u0304 denote the restriction to J; it is straightforward\nto check that \u03c4\u0304 again is densely defined, l.s.c. and nontrivial. By Proposition 5.1,\n\u03c4\u0304 extends to a l.s.c. trace \u03c4 \u2032 on A; since \u03c4\u0304 is nontrivial, so is \u03c4 \u2032 .\n\u0003\nProposition 5.3. Let A be a separable C \u2217 -algebra and suppose A has no nontrivial\nl.s.c. trace.\nThen, no hereditary C \u2217 -subalgebra of A has a finite-dimensional irreducible representation.\nProof. If B \u2282 A was a hereditary C \u2217 -subalgebra with a finited-dimensional irreducible representation, then B also had a (necessarily nontrivial) tracial state. By\nCorollary 5.2, this would yield a nontrivial l.s.c. trace on A, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nWe are now prepared to prove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 5.4. Let A be a separable C \u2217 -algebra with dimnuc A \u2264 n < \u221e.\nIf A has no nontrivial l.s.c. 2-quasitrace, then A is weakly purely infinite.\nIn particular, if A is simple, it is either strongly purely infinite, hence absorbs\nthe Cuntz algebra O\u221e , or it is stably finite with at least one densely defined trace.\nProof. Suppose A has no nontrivial l.s.c. 2-quasitrace. By Proposition 5.3, no\nhereditary C \u2217 -subalgebra of A has a finite-dimensional irreducible representation.\nBy Proposition 4.3 this yields\ncov(A\u03c9 \u2229 A\u2032 /Ann(A)) \u2264 (n + 1)2 < \u221e.\nBy [14, Proposition 3.7], this implies that A is weakly purely infinite.\nFor the second statement, suppose A is simple but not purely infinite. Then, A\nis not weakly purely infinite by [15], so A admits a nontrivial l.s.c. 2-quasitrace.\nTherefore, A contains a nonzero hereditary C \u2217 -subalgebra B with a bounded 2quasitrace, which is a trace by [9] or [13] since B is nuclear. But then B \u2297 K has\na densely defined trace \u03c4 . By Brown's Theorem, A is a hereditary subalgebra of\n\n\f22\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\nB \u2297 K, and it is straightforward to check that \u03c4 restricts to a (nonzero) densely\ndefined trace on A.\nFor the statement that a simple purely infinite C \u2217 -algebra absorbs O\u221e see [12]\nor [24, Theorem 7.2.6].\n\u0003\nRemark 5.5. As of this moment, we do not know whether in the preceding result\na traceless C \u2217 -algebra A will even be strongly purely infinite; this would imply\nthat A is O\u221e -stable. The problem is closely related to the question whether finite\nnuclear dimension implies Z-stability for sufficiently noncommutative C \u2217 -algebras,\ncf. Conjecture 9.3. In fact, Theorem 5.4 may be regarded as encouraging evidence\nto this effect.\n6. Examples\nIn this section we list a number of examples for which we can compute or at least\ngive bounds of their nuclear dimension. We will exhibit more examples in the\nsubsequent sections.\nExample 6.1. We have already seen that decomposition rank dominates nuclear\ndimension, and that the two theories agree in the zero-dimensional and in the\ncommutative case, and for continuous trace C \u2217 -algebras. This makes most examples\nof [16, Section 4] accessible to nuclear dimension as well. In particular, for irrational\nrotation algebras A\u03b8 , we have\n\u001a\n1 if \u03b8 is irrational\ndimnuc A\u03b8 =\n2 if \u03b8 is rational.\nExample 6.2. In [29] it will be shown that, if \u03b1 is a minimal homeomorphism of\nan infinite, compact, finite-dimensional, metrizable space X, then\ndimnuc (C(X) \u22ca\u03b1 Z) \u2264 2 dim X + 1.\nExamples suggest that this is not the best possible estimate in general (see above),\nand that the nuclear dimension of the crossed product should be bounded by\nmax{1, dim X}, at least in the minimal case. However, for applications it often\nonly matters whether or not the topological dimension is finite.\nFor the decomposition rank, the latter estimate, i.e.,\ndr (C(X) \u22ca\u03b1 Z) \u2264 max{1, dim X},\nis known in special cases, e.g. when the action \u03b1 is a minimal diffeomorphism on a\ncompact smooth manifold X. The known proofs of such results, however, require\nthe full strength of the classification theory for stably finite nuclear C \u2217 -algebras.\nThe result of [29] has the advantage that its proof is much simpler, and more\nconceptual. In particular, it does not factor through classification theorems of any\nkind.\nExample 6.3. Being an extension of C(S 1 ) by the compacts, the Toeplitz algebra\nT has nuclear dimension at most 2 by Proposition 2.9. As of this moment, we do\nnot know whether the precise value is 1 or 2 (it is not 0, since T is not AF). Since\nthe Toeplitz algebra is infinite, hence not quasidiagonal, its decomposition rank is\ninfinite. This in particular shows that decomposition rank and nuclear dimension\ndo not agree.\n\n\fTHE NUCLEAR DIMENSION OF C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n23\n\nExample 6.4. In [23], R\u00f8rdam constructed a simple, separable, unital, and nuclear\nC \u2217 -algebra containing a finite and an infinite projection. This example does not\nhave a nontrivial (quasi-)trace, nor is it purely infinite, so by Theorem 5.4 it has\ninfinite nuclear dimension.\n7. Kirchberg algebras\nBelow we will establish that classifiable simple purely infinite C \u2217 -algebras have\nfinite nuclear dimension. It suffices to prove this for classical Cuntz algebras and\nthen use inductive limit representations of classifiable algebras. To this end let us\ncollect some standard notation and background results.\nFix n \u2208 N, n \u2265 2 and recall that the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra Tn is the universal\nC \u2217 -algebra generated by n isometries T1 , . . . , Tn subject to the relations Ti\u2217 Tj =\n\u03b4ij 1, whereas the Cuntz algebra On is the universal C \u2217 -algebraP\ngenerated by n\nn\n\u2217\nisometries S1 , . . . , Sn subject to the relations Si\u2217 Sj = \u03b4ij 1 and\ni=1 Si Si = 1.\nS\u221e k\nLet I = {1, . . . , n} and Wn = k=0 I be the set of multi-indices or words in\nthe alphabet I.

Alternatively, following along the lines of the proof of Theorem 8.5,\nwe could define \u03c8k (x) = h0 Pk xPk h0 \u2295 h1 Qk xQk h1 , where h0 and h1 are suitable\npositive diagonal matrices and then argue as in 8.5.\nTheorem 7.4. We have dimnuc On = 1 for n = 2, 3, . . . and dimnuc O\u221e \u2264 2.\nProof. Let {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN } be a finite subset of On and \u03b5 > 0. We need to find a\nfinite dimensional C \u2217 -algebra of the form F = F (0) \u2295 F (1) , a c.p.c. map \u03c8 : On \u2192 F\nand \u03c6 : F \u2192 On c.p. such that \u03c6|F (0) and \u03c6|F (1) are both order zero contractions\nand such that kxi \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8(xi )k < \u03b5 for i = 1, . . . , N .\nTo begin the construction fix \u03c1 : On \u2192 Tn , a u.c.p. lift of the quotient map\nTn \u2192 On , which exists by nuclearity of On . For suitable k (to be determined\nshortly) let F = B(\u0393k,2k ) \u2295 B(\u0393[k/2]+k,[k/2]+2k ) and define \u03c8 = \u03c8k \u25e6 \u03c1 : On \u2192 F .\nNext observe that q \u25e6 \u03c8k : F \u2192 Mdk (Onk ) \u2286 q(B(\u0393(n))) which we compose with\nthe inclusion Mdk (Onk ) \u0592\u2192 Mdk (On ) \u223c\n= On (the latter for suitable k). Moreover,\nMdk (Onk ) contains the copy of On from the inclusion Tn \u2286 B(\u0393(n)); we think of\n{x1 , x2 , . . . , xN } as a subset in that copy and then know from 7.2 that we may find\nk such that kxi \u2212 q \u25e6 \u03c6k \u25e6 \u03c8k \u25e6 \u03c1(xi )k < \u03b5/2 for i = 1, . . . , N and such that dk and\nn \u2212 1 are relatively prime. (Note that \u03c6k \u25e6 \u03c8k (C) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e for any compact\nC \u2208 K(\u0393(n)) so that the choice of \u03c1 does not really matter.)\nFurther, we may regard the inclusion given by\nOn \u0592\u2192 Md (Onk ) \u0592\u2192 Md (On ) \u223c\n= On\nk\n\nk\n\nas a unital \u2217-endomorphism \u03c3 of On . It follows from classification theory that any\nsuch endomorphism is approximately unitarily equivalent to the identity map on\nOn . Indeed, \u03c3 is homotopic to id since it is implemented by a unitary v in On in the\nsense that \u03c3(si ) = vsi for all i = 1, . . . , n and the unitary group of On is connected.\nBy Kirchberg's Classification Theorem ([24] 8.3.3(iii)) \u03c3 and id are asymptotically\nhence approximately unitarily equivalent.\nThus there is a unitary u \u2208 On such that\nkuxi u\u2217 \u2212 \u03c3(xi )k < \u03b5/2.\nDefine \u03c6(x) = u\u2217 (\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c6k (x))u, where \u03b2 denotes the map from Mdk (Tnk ) to On\ndiscussed above. Then (F, \u03c8, \u03c6) is as desired.\nThe estimate for O\u221e follows since there is an obvious inductive limit representation O\u221e = limn\u2192\u221e Tn , and we know that dimnuc Tn \u2264 2 because of the exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 K \u2192 Tn \u2192 On \u2192 0\nand 2.9(ii).\n\n\u0003\n\n\f28\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\nUsing Kirchberg\u2013Phillips classification it can be shown that every Kirchberg\nalgebra satisfying the UCT is an inductive limit of C \u2217 -algebras of the form\n(Mk1 \u2297 On1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Mkr \u2297 Onr ) \u2297 C(T),\nwhere ni \u2208 {2, 3, . . .}\u222a{\u221e} and ki \u2208 N (cf. [24], 8.4.11). Since the nuclear dimension\nof any such algebra is at most 5 by Proposition 2.3, we obtain the following.\nTheorem 7.5. A Kirchberg algebra (i.e., a purely infinite, simple, separable, nuclear C \u2217 -algebra) satisfying the UCT has nuclear dimension at most 5.\n8. Roe algebras\nIn this section we explore a connection between the asymptotic dimension of a\ncoarse space and the nuclear dimension of its uniform Roe algebra. Although both\nconcepts may be defined for arbitrary coarse spaces (c.f. [22]) we restrict ourselves\nto discrete metric spaces of bounded geometry, mostly for simplicity.\nRecall that a discrete metric space (X, d) is said to be of bounded geometry\nif every ball Br (x) = {y \u2208 X | d(x, y) \u2264 r} of finite radius r has finitely many\nelements, and the number of elements in all balls of a given radius is uniformly\nbounded, that is, br := sup{|Br (x)| | x \u2208 X} < \u221e for all r. This class of coarse\nspaces includes many interesting examples, e.g. finitely generated discrete groups\nwith a word length metric.\nIn this setting the uniform Roe algebra U Cr\u2217 (X) associated to (X, d) can be\ndefined as follows:\nConsider complex matrices [\u03b1x,y ] indexed by x, y \u2208 X such that\n(i) there is M \u2265 0 with |\u03b1x,y | \u2264 M for all x, y \u2208 X (i.e. [\u03b1x,y ] is uniformly\nbounded);\n(ii) there is r > 0 such that \u03b1x,y = 0 whenever d(x, y) > r (i.e. [\u03b1x,y ] has\nbounded width).\nThe smallest r in condition (ii) is called the width of the matrix a = [\u03b1x,y ], denoted\nby w(a). Any matrix satisfying (i) and (ii) defines a bounded operator on l2 (X),\nagain denoted by a. We have in fact the following elementary estimate.\nLemma 8.1. Let a = [\u03b1x,y ] be a matrix satisfying (i) and (ii) above and let\nb(a) := bw(a) = sup{|Bw(a) (x)| | x \u2208 X}.\nThen, kak \u2264 b(a)M .\nP\nProof. For (\u03b2x ) \u2208 l2 (X) the sum \u03b3x = y \u03b1x,y \u03b2y is well-defined containing at most\nb(a) many terms for each x \u2208 X. Thus\nX\n|\u03b2y |2 .\n|\u03b3x |2 \u2264 b(a)M 2\ny\u2208Bw(a) (x)\n\nSince\n\nP\n\ny\u2208Bw(a) (x) |\u03b2y |\n\n2\n\n\u2264 b(a)k(\u03b2x )k2 we obtain k(\u03b3x )k \u2264 M b(a)k(\u03b2x )k.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefine the Roe algebra U Cr\u2217 (X) of (X, d) as the concrete C \u2217 -algebra generated\nby matrices satisfying (i) and (ii) above, that is, the closure of the set of such\nmatrices. Note that if a \u2208 U Cr\u2217 (X) has finite width then the matrix entries are\nuniformly bounded (by kak).\nWe next recall the definition of the asymptotic dimension of (X, d). Note first\nthat by a uniform cover U of X we mean a family of subsets of X such that\n\n\fTHE NUCLEAR DIMENSION OF C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n29\n\nS\n\nU\u2208U U = X and such that the diameters d(U ) of all U \u2208 U are uniformly bounded.\nA cover U has multiplicity or order n if there are n+ 1 different U0 , . . . , Un \u2208 U such\nthat U0 \u2229. . . \u2229Un 6= \u2205 but any n+ 2 different elements in U have empty intersection.\n\nDefinition 8.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space. The asymptotic dimension asdim X\ndoes not exceed n if for every uniform cover U there is a uniform cover V of order\nn such that U refines V (i.e. every U \u2208 U is contained in a V \u2208 V).\nA family U of subsets of X is said to be r-discrete if the distance d(U, U \u2032 ) > r\nfor any two different U, U \u2032 \u2208 U. We need the following characterization of the\nasymptotic dimension which is part of [1, Theorem 19].\nTheorem 8.3. For a metric space (X, d) the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) The asymptotic dimension asdim X does not exceed n.\n(ii) For arbitrarily large r > 0 there exist r-discrete families\nU (0) , . . . , U (n)\nof subsets of X such that U (0) \u222a . . . \u222a U (n) is a uniform cover of X.\nIt is known that U Cr\u2217 (X) is nuclear if (X, d) is a discrete metric space of bounded\ngeometry and finite asymptotic dimension. We will reprove this by constructing\nexplicit approximating nets in the proof of the main result of this section below.\nNotice that for X = \u0393 a discrete group, its uniform Roe algebra U Cr\u2217 (\u0393) is nuclear\niff \u0393 is exact. Also other approximation properties of \u0393 can be formulated in terms\nof the uniform Roe algebra ([40]).\nLemma 8.4. Let\nQ K be any index set and (nk )k\u2208K a bounded family of positive\nintegers. Then k\u2208K Mnk is an AF algebra.\nQ\nProof. Without loss assume (nk ) to be constantly equal to n ( k\u2208K Mnk is a finite direct sum of such). Then any partition P = {P1 , . . . , Pl } of K defines an\nembedding of\nY\nMn \u2295 . . . \u2295 Mn \u2192\nMnk\n|\n{z\n}\nk\u2208K\n\nl\n\nsending x1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 xl to the family constantly equal to xi on Pi for i = 1, . . . , l. The\nunion\nQ of all the ranges of these embeddings for all possible finite partitions is dense\n\u0003\nin k\u2208K Mnk .\n\nTheorem 8.5. Let (X, d) be a discrete metric space of bounded geometry. Then\ndimnuc (U Cr\u2217 (X)) \u2264 asdim(X).\n\nProof. Let r \u2208 N and choose,\nS according to Theorem 8.3, uniform r-disjoint families\nU (0) , . . . , U (n) such that ni=0 U (i) covers X. We will define a completely positive\ncontraction\n\u03a8r : U Cr\u2217 (X) \u2192 A(0) \u2295 . . . \u2295 A(n) ,\nwhere\nA(i) =\n\nY\n\nM|Br\u22121 (U)| .\n\nU\u2208U (i)\n\nBy Lemma 8.4 every A(i) is AF and moreover naturally contained in U Cr\u2217 (X).

If\nwe can show that \u03a6r \u25e6 \u03a8r (a) \u2192 a for all a \u2208 U Cr\u2217 (X) then we are done since\nwe can combine the \u03a6r and \u03a8r with a standard approximating net (\u03c8\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb ) of\nA(0) \u2295 . . . \u2295 A(n) , where the \u03c6\u03bb are order 0, in fact \u2217-homomorphic using 8.4.\nIn order to define \u03a8r let\nh\n\n(i)\n\nr\n1 X X\n=\n\u03c7B(U,l\u22121) ,\nr\n(i)\nl=1\n\nU\u2208U\n\nwhere \u03c7S denotes the characteristic function of S and\nB(U, s) = {x \u2208 X | d(x, U ) \u2264 s}.\nThen h(0) , . . . , h(n) are commuting positive contractions; moreover\n1 \u2264 h :=\n\nn\nX\n\nh(i) \u2264 (n + 1)1.\n\ni=0\n\nU Cr\u2217 (X)\n(i)\n\nIf a \u2208\nis given by the matrix [\u03b1x,y ] then [h(i) , a] is given by the matrix\n(i)\n[(h (x) \u2212 h (y))\u03b1x,y ] and if a has finite width w(a) < r then this commutator\nhas still the same width and by Lemma 8.1 it follows that\nk[h(i) , a]k\n\n\u2264 b(a) sup{|h(i) (x) \u2212 h(i) (y)| | d(x, y) < w(a)}kak\nw(a)\nb(a)kak\n\u2264\nr\n\nand thus\nk[h, a]k \u2264\nNow define\n\nn+1\nw(a)b(a)kak.\nr\n\n\u00111/2\n\u0010\n.\nhi = h(i) h\u22121\n\nSince [h\u22121 , a] = h\u22121 [a, h]h\u22121 we have\n\nk[h\u22121 , a]k \u2264 kh\u22121 k2 k[h, a]k \u2264 k[h, a]k,\nso that\nk[h(i) h\u22121 , a]k \u2192 0\nas r \u2192 \u221e.\nApproximating the function t 7\u2192 t1/2 by polynomials and using\nk[a, xn ]k \u2264 nk[a, x]kkxkn\u22121\nfor any x we find that also\n\u0014\u0010\n\n(i) \u22121\n\nh h\n\n\u00111/2\n\n,a\n\n\u0015\n\n= k[hi , a]k \u2192 0\n\nas r \u2192 \u221e, whenever a \u2208 U Cr\u2217 (X) has finite width.

Outlook. Open problems.\nIn this final section we list a number of open problems and possible future developments of the theory.\nIt follows trivially from the definitions that decomposition rank dominates nuclear dimension, and our (purely) infinite examples show that the two theories do\nnot agree in general. One might ask, however, whether infiniteness is the only\nobstruction.\nQuestion 9.1. If A is a C \u2217 -algebra with dimnuc A < \u221e, and if A has a faithful\ntrace, do we have dimnuc A = dr A? Do we at least have dr A < \u221e?\nWe have by now established upper and lower bounds for the nuclear dimension\nof a number of examples; while for many applications it is enough to know whether\nthe dimension is finite or infinite, it would nontheless be more satisfying to know\nthe precise values, at least for the most important examples. The problem is that in\ngeneral it is hard to find lower bounds for the nuclear dimension \u2013 and in this respect\nour theory behaves just as many other (both commutative and noncommutative)\nnotions of dimension.\nProblem 9.2. Determine the precise value of the nuclear dimension of the Toeplitz\nalgebra, the Cuntz algebra O\u221e , and, more generally, of Kirchberg algebras satisfying\nthe UCT. Is the nuclear dimension of the latter determined by algebraic properties\nof their K-groups, such as torsion?\nA conjecture of Toms relates various regularity properties for separable, simple,\nfinite, unital, and nuclear C \u2217 -algebras. Our nuclear dimension enables us to put\nthis conjecture into a broader context.\nConjecture 9.3. For a separable, simple, unital, infinite dimensional and nuclear\nC \u2217 -algebra A, the following are equivalent:\n(i) A has finite nuclear dimension.\n(ii) A is Z-stable.\n(iii) A has strict comparison of positive elements.\n(iv) A has almost unperforated Cuntz semigroup.\n\n\f32\n\nWILHELM WINTER AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS\n\nAs we have mentioned earlier, it will be shown in [29] that crossed products of\ncontinuous functions on compact and finite dimensional spaces by the integers via\nminimal homeomorphisms have finite nuclear dimension. One might ask for similar\nresults when the underlying C \u2217 -algebra is noncommutative, or when the group is\nmore complicated.\nProblem 9.4. Find conditions on A, G and \u03b1, under which dimnuc (A \u22ca\u03b1 G) is\nfinite.\nIt is an open problem whether it is possible to recover a coarse metric space\n(up to coarse equivalence) from its uniform Roe algebra. To make at least some\nprogress in this direction, one might ask for a converse to Theorem 8.5.\nQuestion 9.5. Suppose X is a discrete metric space of bounded geometry. Do we\nhave dimnuc (U Cr\u2217 (X)) = asdim X?\nIf the preceding question has a negative answer, we face another, perhaps even\nmore interesting task:\nProblem 9.6. Characterize all coarse metric spaces the Roe algebras of which have\nfinite nuclear dimension. Describe regularity properties at the level of spaces (or\ngroups) which are implied by finite nuclear dimension of the associated Roe algebras.\nWe have seen that quite different examples of noncommutative topological spaces\nare accessible to nuclear dimension; it is therefore natural to try to apply our theory\nto objects of a more geometric nature, such as Connes' spectral triples, cf. [5] and\n[6].\nProblem 9.7. Find examples of spectral triples (A, \u03c0, D) for which the nuclear\ndimension of A can be related to summability properties of D.\nReferences\n1. G. Bell and A.
