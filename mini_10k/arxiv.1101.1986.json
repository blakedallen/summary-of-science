[5].\nIn Ref. [4] I analyzed the possibility of the\nformation of bound states of electrons participating in spherically symmetric oscillations\ndue to the exchange of ion acoustic waves.\nNote that in Ref. [4] the dynamics of electron\noscillations was treated in frames of the classical electrodynamics. In the comment on my\nwork made by Dr. Shmatov [6], it was claimed\nthat the classical physics description adopted\nin Ref. [4] is inconsistent with the numerical\nestimates presented in my paper, since the\ntypical energy of an electron participating in\noscillations is below the minimal kinetic en-\n\nNowadays there is a lack of a universally\nrecognized theoretical model of stable natural plasma structures existing in the atmosphere [1]. An approach to the description\nof such a plasmoid based on radial oscillations of electron gas was recently put forward\nin Refs. [2\u20134]. Oscillations of electrons were\ntreated in both quantum and classical frameworks [2] within the proposed model. Various\nimportant phenomena, such as emission of\nhigh energy radiation, which arise in spherically symmetric plasma oscillations, were also\npredicted [3]. Note that other theoretical\ndescriptions of natural plasmoids, including\n1\n\n\fbe necessarily treated as forced oscillations\nas in Ref. [4]. It was demonstrated in Ref. [9]\nthat a plasma oscillation has to be considered\nas a wave packet where both rapid and slow\nmotions are present since a monochromatic\nLangmuir wave is likely to be unstable [10].\nThus the results of Ref. [4] can be applied\nto those electrons which participate in slow\noscillations.\n\nergy Eq (see Ref. [6]) resulting from the Heseinberg uncertainty principle.\nI disagree with the statement of Ref. [6]\nthat classical electrodynamics is invalid for\nthe description of the bound state formation.\nIndeed, to form a bound state the energy\nof the effective attraction should be greater\nthan the kinetic energy of electrons (see, e.g.,\nRef. [7]). As in Ref. [4] we can discuss singly\nionized nitrogen plasma with the background\nelectron density n0 = 1015 cm\u22123 and electron\ntemperature T = 105 K, which corresponds\nto the typical plasma of a gas discharge [8].\nNote that this value of T is different from\nthat used in Ref. [4]. Taking the amplitude\nof electron oscillations a \u223c 102 ke\u22121 , where\nke is the Debye wave number, and the distance between oscillating electrons d \u223c 10a\nas well as using Eq. (16) from Ref. [4], we\nget that the effective attraction takes place if\n|\u03c9i \u2212 \u03a9| \u2264 10\u22124 \u03c9i , where \u03c9i is the ion Langmuir frequency and \u03a9 is the frequency of the\nelectron motion. Note that in this case the\nkinetic energy of electrons prevails both the\nenergy of their thermal motion \u223c several eV\nand Eq \u223c 10\u221218 eV.\nThus I have demonstrated that the classical electrodynamics description of the bound\nstate formation of electrons participating in\nradial oscillations is still valid although one\nshould choose the values of the parameters\nof the system, like T , d, and a, different\nfrom those in Ref. [4]. Nevertheless, I thank\nDr. Shmatov for pointing out in his comment [6] the unsuccessful choice of the parameters in my work [4].\nFinally I mention that electron harmonic\nmotion on the frequency \u03a9 < \u03c9i should not\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by CONICYT (Chile) through Programa Bicentenario\nPSD-91-2006.
