It was proposed in semimetals, in\nwhich there is a band overlap and the normal states are\nunstable. The true ground state becomes a state with\nelectron-hole pairs due to the Coulomb interaction. This\nkind of state can also occur in semiconductors once the\nenergy gap becomes smaller than the binding energy of\nan exciton1 . This so-called 'excitonic insulator' has been\ndiscussed for many years theoretically but materials in\nexperiment were seldom reported so far. 1T \u2212 T iSe2,\namong the transition-metal dichalcogenides, may be one\nexample of the excitonic insulators which obtained more\nand more direct evidences from experiments4,5 . Another\npossible example is CaB6 . The latter one has gained\nmore attention since weak ferromagnetism was found in\nslightly doped CaB6 in 19996. Theoretically many authors relate this to the historical excitonic insulators7\u20139 .\nBy now there are still debates on this proposal, especially about the band gap. The angle-resolved photoemission spectrum showed a gap of 1ev10,11 which\nis too large for excitonic instability and another large\ngap of 0.8ev is given by the LDA+GW calculations12 .\nBand overlap and semimetal framework were demonstrated by the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de\nHaas experiments13\u201315 and local density approximation\nband structure calculations16\u201318 . Though there are controversies on the band structure, the excitonic insulator\nscenario is nevertheless a very promising explaination for\nthe main physics in CaB6 .\nIn Ca1\u2212x Lax B6 , slightly La doping would induce not\nonly the carriers but also impurities/disorders inevitably\nand the impurity effects played an important role in the\nformation of the weak ferromagnetism. According to the\nfirst principle calculations, the defects or vacancies in the\nboron sublattice can result in impurity bands or localized gap states and this modification may be important\nto the origin of ferromagnetism in CaB6 19,20 . From the\nlanguage of excitonic insulators, the impurities will induce in-gap bound states and it was confirmed by tunneling measurements on high-quality defect-controlled single\n\ncrystals21 . Therefore the impurity effect can not be neglected in the excitonic insulator theory for CaB6 . To\nexplore how the charged impurity doping can affect the\nexcitonic insulators constitutes one of the motivations\nof this paper. Another motivation originates from the\nincompleteness of the research on impurity effects in excitonic insulators. Historically the impurity scattering\nin excitonic insulators was investigated by J. Zittartz in\n196722 and in that work only intra-band nonmagnetic\nimpurity in exciton insulators with no regard for the\nspin freedom was studied. Inter-band nonmagnetic impurity scattering was investigated by T.Ichinomiya23 and\nother works concentrated in the bilayer systems24,25 in\nwhich the spin freedom was also neglected. In this paper\nwe will discuss and compare the inter-/intra-band magnetic/nonmagnetic impurity effect in singlet and triplet\nexcitonic insulators. We will also modify the exciton insulator scenario on ferromagnetism in Ca1\u2212x Lax B6 .\nThis paper is constructed as follows: In the first section we will introduce our model and Hamiltonian. Then\nwe will give the locations of the bound states induced by\nsingle magnetic or nonmagnetic impurity. Finite concentration problems of impurities and pair breaking effects\nwill be discussed in the third section. In the fourth section we will investigate the impurity caused-modification\nto the ferromagnetism in doped exciton insulators. We\nwill leave the summary and further discussion to the last\nsection.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND HAMILTONIAN\n\nWe introduce the noninteracting Hamiltonian in a two\nband system:\nX\nH0 =\n(\u03b5ak a\u2020k,\u03c3 ak,\u03c3 + \u03b5bk b\u2020k,\u03c3 bk,\u03c3 )\nk,\u03c3\n\nhere the kinetic energy in two electron bands are \u03b5ak =\n~2 k 2\n~2 k 2\n1\n1\nb\n2ma \u2212 2 EG , \u03b5k = \u2212 2mb + 2 EG , in which EG is the band\ngap or overlap and |EG | should be quite small to keep the\nground state remain in the excitonic phase. Without losing generality, we consider two symmetric bands, which\n\n\f2\nmeans ma = mb = m. Now we introduce the interaction\nterm, which reads:\nU1 X\na\u2020k+q,\u03c3 b\u2020k\u2032 \u2212q,\u03c3\u2032 bk\u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 ak,\u03c3\nH1 =\n\u03a9\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\nthe pole of the T-matrix gives the bound state energy. In\nsinglet excitonic insulators, for nonmagnetic impurity,\n\u2206S < 0\n\nEB2\n\n\u2206S (\u03b12n \u2212 \u03b11n ) < 0\n\nk,k ,q,\u03c3,\u03c3\n\nwhere U1 represents the interaction term which comes\nfrom the Coulomb interaction. In most of the bulk samples, the system will choose singlet or triplet excitonic\nphase as the ground state26 because there is a finite splitting between singlet and triplet states. The splitting may\ncome from short-range Coulomb terms which favor triplet\nstate, or electron-phonon interaction which favors singlet\nstate27 . In the presence of nesting effect, if the screened\nCoulomb interaction term dominates there will be a degeneracy between singlet and triplet excitonic phase. In\nthis case there is an SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) symmetry in the excitonic insulators. In bilayer systems this splitting is exponentially small because of the inter-layer distance and\nthe barriers between two layers28, and spin freedom can\nthus be neglected. It is also believed that the splitting in\nCaB6 is quite small8 .\nNow we introduce the singlet and triplet order parameters: \u2206s and \u2206T and rewrite the mean-field Model\ninto Nambu space: By introducing the vector \u03c8 =\n(ak\u2191 , ak\u2193 , bk\u2191 , bk\u2193 ), the Hamiltonian can be written as :\nX\nHMF =\n\u03c8\u2020 M \u03c8\nk\n\nwhere M is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix, then the bare Green function\nfor singlet excitonic insulators is\nG\u22121\n0 (k, \u03c9)\n=\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212\n\n=\u03c9\u2212\n\n~2 2\n2m k\n\nE\n\n+ 2g ) * I\n\u2212\u2206S * I\nE\n~2 2\n\u2212\u2206S * I\n(\u03c9 + 2m k \u2212 2g ) * I\n\n=\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212\n\n~2 2\n2m k\n\nE\n\n+ 2g ) * I\n\u2212\u2206T * \u03c3\nE\n~2 2\nk \u2212 2g ) * I\n\u2212\u2206T * \u03c3\n(\u03c9 + 2m\n\n!\n\nEB2\n\nwhere \u03b11m = J1m \u03c0NF S(S+1) , \u03b12m = J2m \u03c0NF S(S+1).\nNotice some extreme cases in the singlet excitonic insulators, for the negative order parameter and if there is only\none scattering channel exists, the bound state energy will\nhave the same form of the single magnetic impurity in s\u00b1\u2206(1\u2212\u03b12 )\nwave superconductors29\u201331 , which reads EB = 1+\u03b12 i\ni\n(i=1n,2n,1m,2m). In this case the bound state energy\nwill move to the Fermi energy with the increasing of the\nscattering constant while move to the gap-edge side with\nthe decreasing of impurity scattering. If there is no impurity scattering (Ji\u03bd = 0), the excitation will emerge\ninto the normal excitonic gap EB = \u00b1\u2206.\nIn triplet case, the bound state energy can be obtained\nin the same way. For single nonmagnetic impurity\n\u2206T [1 \u2212 (\u03b11n + \u03b12n )2 ]\n;\n1 + (\u03b11n + \u03b122n\n\u2206T [1 \u2212 (\u03b11n \u2212 \u03b12n )2 ]\n=\u00b1\n;\n1 + (\u03b11n \u2212 \u03b12n )2\n\n(1)\n\nEB2\n\n\u00b1(\u03b11n \u2212 \u03b12n )\u2206T < 0\n\n(2)\n\nSince the form of the bound state energy for single magnetic impurity in triplet excitonic insulators is quite complex, we only give the numerical results. The bound state\nenergies for single nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity in\nsinglet and triplet excitonic insulators are shown in Fig1.\n\nThe impurity scattering term can be written as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ1n * I + J1m \u03c3 * S J2n + J2m \u03c3 * S\nV =\nJ2n + J2m \u03c3 * S J1n * I + J1m \u03c3 * S\nin which \u03bd = n, m represents the nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity scattering. S denotes the spin operator of\nthe magnetic impurity and i = 1, 2 represents the intraband and inter-band channel, respectively.\nIII.\n\n\u2206S [1 \u2212 (\u03b11m + \u03b12m )2 ]\n1 + (\u03b11m + \u03b12m )2\n\u2212\u2206S [1 \u2212 (\u03b11m \u2212 \u03b12m )2 ]\n=\n1 + (\u03b11m \u2212 \u03b12m )2\n\nEB1 =\n\n\u00b1(\u03b11n + \u03b12n )\u2206T < 0\n\nand triplet excitonic insulators:\nT\nG0\u22121 (k, \u03c9) = \u03c9 \u2212 HMF\n\nwhere \u03b11n = J1n \u03c0NF , \u03b12n = J2n \u03c0NF . And for magnetic impurity case,\n\nEB1 = \u00b1\n\nS\nHMF\n\n!\n\n\u2206S [1 \u2212 (\u03b11n + \u03b12n )2 ]\n;\n1 + (\u03b11n + \u03b12n )2\n\u2212\u2206S [1 \u2212 (\u03b11n \u2212 \u03b12n )2 ]\n=\n;\n1 + (\u03b11n \u2212 \u03b12n )2\n\nEB1 =\n\nSINGLE IMPURITY PROBLEMS\n\nTo obtain the bound state energy, one has to get the\nT-matrix which can be written as:\nV\nT =\n1 \u2212 G0 (r = 0, \u03c9)V\n\nFrom Fig1 we can see that location of the bound state\nenergy which is induced by single impurity is very different between singlet excitonic insulators and triplet ones.\nFurthermore, in excitonic insulators, the quasiparticle induced by single nonmagnetic or magnetic impurity can\nconsist one or two hole (\u03c9 < 0) or one or two particle\ntype (\u03c9 > 0) states in some range of J1n , J2n or J1m ,\nJ2m . This is quite different from the single magnetic\nimpurity in s-wave superconductors in which hole and\nelectron type excitations must appear symmetrically at\nthe same time. It is well known that both the hole- and\nelectron-type components of the bound states can be detected by the low-temperature tunneling microscope32 .\nThus the results of the bound state energies are valuable\nsince they can be used to detect the symmetry of the excitonic insulators, especially for the materials with qutie\nsmall splitting of singlet and triplet states.\n\n\f3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB\n\nE /\n\nS\n\n1\n\nwhere <>I means averaging all the impurity positions\nand nimp represents the density of impurities.

We can see the bound states caused by single magnetic impurity in triplet exciton insulators are very close\nto the gap edge. With the increasing of the impurity concentration an impurity band is expanding and the states\nare stretching to the Fermi level.

This phase transition from gaped phase to\ngapless phase is of second order as pointed out by J.\nZittartz22 . However, the nonmagnetic impurities have\nthe same pair breaking effect to singlet and triplet excitonic insulators but magnetic impurities behave differently in these two systems. A significant difference can be\n\nseen from the right part in Fig2 in which the triplet excitonic insulators are more robust with magnetic impurity\ndoping. Notice that the pair breaking effect coming from\nthe self-consistent equations is decided by the relative\namplitude and sign between the factor of renormalized\nfrequency and order parameter in the self-energy. Therefore, to compare the pair-breaking effect in quantization\nbetween different cases, we define the pair breaking factor\nwhich can be written as\nx=\n\n \u0303\nf (\u2206)\nf (\u03c9\u0303)\n\nIt is analogical to the notations in R. Balian et al\n's work in p-wave superconductors33 . According to\nAbrikosov-Gor'kov theory34 , in conventional s-wave superconductors, x = \u22121 stands for magnetic impurities\nand x = 1 stands for nonmagnetic impurities. Then we\nlist all the pair breaking effects in singlet and triplet excitonic insulators.\n\uf8f1\n\u22121 \u03bbS,n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u22121 \u03bbS,m\nx=\n(8)\n\u03bbT,n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u22121\n1\n\u03bbT,m\n3\n\nwhere \u03bbS,n , \u03bbS,m , \u03bbT,n , \u03bbT,m represent the nonmagnetic\nimpurity scattering and magnetic impurity scattering in\nthe intra-band/inter band channel in singlet and triplet\nexcitonic insulators, respectively.\nIt is well known that the nonmagnetic impurities are\nnot pair breakers in s-wave conventional superconductors according to Anderson's theorem. Note in singlet\nand triplet excitonic insulators nonmagnetic impurities\nhave the same pair-breaking effect. This is analogical to\nthe magnetic impurities in the s-wave superconductors in\nwhich the time reversal symmetry is broken due to the\nspin-flip impurity scattering. The Kramer's degeneracy is\nreplaced by the particle-hole symmetry in the singlet and\ntriplet excitonic insulators. According to our calculations\ntriplet excitonic insulators are more stable with magnetic\nimpurity doping than singlet samples. nT /nS = 3, where\nnT and nS are the critical doping concentration of magnetic impurities in triplet and singlet excitonic insulators,\nrespectively. This result is in accordance with the single\nimpurity analysis. From Fig1 we can see that the bound\nstates energy is close to the gap edge for the magnetic impurity in triplet excitonic insulators. And it needs larger\nimpurity concentration in triplet than in singlet excitonic\ninsulators to fill the gap with states.\nV.\n\nIMPURITY EFFECTS AND\nFERROMAGNETISM\n\nIn undoped CaB6 the splitting of singlet and triplet\nexcitonic phases is neglectable8 , then the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)\nsymmetry is preserved and in this case the samples show\nno magnetic signals since there is no polarization in the\nsystems. All kinds of spin polarization states have the\n\n\f5\nsame energy. Once the doping induce extra carriers\nthe degeneracy between singlet and triplet states can be\nlifted7,35 . The doped electrons are aligned in one direction to make the energy minimized. Then the system\nhave two order parameters \u2206\u2191 and \u2206\u2193 , which have the\nrelationship with \u2206S and \u2206T in doped situation35\n1\n\u2206S0 1\n) 2 + \u2206\u2191 ln(\u2206S0 \u2206T 0 ) 2 = \u2206\u2191 ln|\u2206\u2191 |\n\u2206T 0\n1\n\u2206S0 1\n) 2 + \u2206\u2193 ln(\u2206S0 \u2206T 0 ) 2\n\u2206\u2191 ln(\n\u2206T 0\nq\n= \u2206\u2193 ln(2n + 4n2 + \u22062\u2193 )\n\n\u2206\u2193 ln(\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2206S0 and \u2206T 0 are the singlet and triplet excitonic order parameters of undoped case in the absence\nof impurities, respectively. n is the concentration of the\ndoping electrons. At zero doping at T = 0 we have\n\u2206S0 = \u2206T 0 = \u22060 and in doped samples we have7,35\np\n\u2206\u2193 = \u22060 (\u22060 \u2212 4n)\n(0 < n < \u2206/4)\n\u2206\u2191 = \u22060\n(0 < n < \u2206/2)\nNow we can see that ferromagnetism can exist in the doping range of [0, \u22060 /2]. In the doping level [0, \u22060 /4], the\ndoped electrons are polarized (DP). In the doping level\n[\u22060 /4, \u22060 /2], all of the electrons and holes are paired in\none direction and system is in the fully polarized phase\n(FP). When n > \u22060 /2, the excitonic state is no longer\nfavored and system undergoes a first order transition into\nthe normal metallic state. This phase transition is different with the excitonic insulator-metal phase transition we\ndiscussed above. The former one is caused by carrier doping and becomes a normal metal after the transition. The\nlatter one is caused by the impurity doping and undergoes a transition into the impure metal phase. Besides,\nfor the impurity induced excitonic insulator-metal phase\ntransition, generally there is a second order phase transition into a gapless region before the excitonic insulatormetal phase transition.\nIn bulk materials the La doping would induce impurities or disorders inevitably and in this case both the\ncarrier doing and impurity effect must be considered.\nFor CaB6 , since there is no exact experimental data of\n\u22060 and if we consider a general excitonic gap of order\n\u223d 600K 6, the ferromagnetism range via doping should\nbe 0 \u2212 3% and this doping range is much larger than the\nexperimental results 0 \u2212 1%. If the excitonic insulators\nscenario is responsible for the physics in CaB6 , one possible reason for the narrow range of ferromagnetism is\nthe anisotropy of the band structure7,8 . However this is\nnot enough and we must involve the pair breaking effects\ncaused by impurity or disorder. A direct evidence for\nthis comes from the tunnelling experiments21 , in which\nit is surprising to find that there exists ferromagnetism in\n99.9% pure boron of CaB6 within a small range of carrier\ndoping while there are no magnetic signals in 99.9999%\nsamples. For high purity samples the exciton gap may be\ntoo large compared to the doping concentration and the\n\nsplitting between \u2206\u2193 and \u2206\u2191 is neglectable. Therefore\nthe ferromagnetism can not be found. More disorders\nor impurities in the samples suppress the excitonic order\nparameters and make it comparable to the doping level.\nThen the impurity effect results in two changes: a more\nsignificant splitting of \u2206\u2193 and \u2206\u2191 and a narrower doping\nrange of ferromagnetism.\nTo express our physics in detail we carry out the numerical work by replacing the \u2206 in (1) with \u2206S *I +\u2206T *\u03c3.\nFor simplification we choose the triplet exciton along the\nz direction.

But in the magnetic impurity\nscattering case, the order parameter of singlet and triplet\nexcitons splits with the increasing of the impurity concentration. Both two kinds of order parameters disappear\nat the same doping concentration at which the excitonic\ninsulator becomes an impure metal. In the situation here\nwe do not consider the gapless excitonic insulator since\nthis regain is quite small(< 0.05\u22060 ). From top to below in Fig3 we can also see that the ferromagnetic region\n0 \u2212 n1 is growing narrower with the increasing of the\nimpurity scattering. To express that clearer we plot the\nphase diagram in J \u2212n plane in Fig4. It is very clear that\nthe nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities would suppress\nthe ferromagnetic range via doping. In magnetic impurity case, the fully polarized range is destroyed by the\n\nimpurity scattering in all doping levels. For pure carriers doping the ferromagnetic range should be 0 \u2212 3%\nand this region are suppressed to 0 \u2212 1% with the impurity scattering Jin \u03c0NF \u2243 2.8 for nonmagnetic case\nand Jim \u03c0NF \u2243 2.0 for magnetic case, where i = 1, 2.\nAnd this result is in accordance with the experimental\ndata. It is worthy to point out that here we considered the charged impurity case which means the density\nof doped electrons and impurities have the same value\nn = nimp = nC\nimp . In CaB6 , the charged impurities are\ninduced by La doping. If there are additional impurities/disorders which are not accompanied with electrons\ndoping, which means nimp > n, they can strengthen the\npair-breaking effects and these extra impurity scattering\nterms can be absorbed into the factor of Jin or Jim directly.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nWe investigated the nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity effects in singlet and triplet excitonic insulators in\nthe inter-band and intra-band channels. In single impurity problems, the bound states showed different compositions in singlet and triplet excitonic insulators, which\ncan be used to detect the symmetry of excitonic insulators in experiments. In finite concentration problems, all\nkinds of impurities showed pair-breaking effects. In the\npresence of impurities, the excitonic insulator scenario\nfor ferromagnetism in CaB6 was modified . The doped\nexcitonic insulators can be characterized in three classes\nby different kinds of doping:\n(1) Electrons doping but no impurity effects induced:\nFerromagnetism emerges with the electrons doping and\nthere are two ferromagnetic phases with doping, the polarized phase for the doped electrons and the full polarized phase for all the excitonic pairs.\n(2) Impurity effects induced but no electrons brought\n\n\f7\nin: i. Nonmagnetic impurities in one channel show same\npair breaking effects to singlet and triplet excitonic insulators. ii. Magnetic impurities in one channel show\nweaker pair breaking effect to triplet excitonic insulators\nthan singlet ones.\n(3) Both electrons and impurity effect were induced\nby doping: Nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity effects\nsuppressed the ferromagnetic region and this provides an\nnatural explaination for the quite narrow region for ferromagnetism in the experiments of CaB6 . In the magnetic impurity case, the fully polarized phase for all the\nelectron-hole pairs was destroyed in all doping levels.\nThe model we discussed here is based on two nested\nbands which have the same effective masses.

In this case the impurities are\nstill pair breakers because they can be seen as oppositely\ncharged pairs to an excitoni22 . This may make the quantitative calculations much more difficult but should show\nthe same conclusions as ours qualitatively. The more\nanisotropy of band structure will obviously reduce the\ntotal magnetism and may lead to the well-known LarkinOvchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrerll state7,8 which is not considered in this work.\nWe would like to thank Chin-Sen Ting, Xiaoming Cai,\nZi Cai and Xiaoling Cui for helpful discussions.
