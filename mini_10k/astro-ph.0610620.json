I present a brief review of some of the mid-infrared properties of interacting galaxies\nas these were revealed using observations from the Infrared Space Observatory and Spitzer\nSpace Telescope over the last decade. The variation of the infrared spectral energy distribution\nin interacting galaxies can be used as an extinction free tracer not only of the location of the star\nformation activity but also of the physical mechanism dominating their energy production.\u2021.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the major steps in the understanding of galaxy evolution was the realization\nthat tails and bridges are the result of galaxy interactions (Toomre & Toomre 1972).\nIt was also proposed that the morphology of the observed tidal features and the separation between the galaxies could be used to create a \"merging sequence\" of (11 at\nfirst) peculiar NGC galaxies found in the Arp Atlas. Ever since, improvements in numerical modeling of the stellar and gaseous component in galaxies have clearly demonstrated that galaxy interactions cause large scale instabilities in the galactic disks leading\nto the formation of transient bars which drive the gas into the center of the galaxies\n(Mihos & Hernquist 1996). Furthermore, numerous multi-wavelength studies of those\nsystems (see Hibbard & van Gorkom 1996; Schweizer 1998, and references therein) have\nbeen performed in effort to better understand phenomena such as starburst and AGN\nactivity, as well as mass transfers and morphological transformations associated with\ninteracting galaxies. The focus of some of these studies was in the identification of observational characteristics which could be used as alternatives of assigning an \"age\" to\nthe event of the interaction (i.e. Schweizer & Seitzer 1992). However, since it was realized\nearly on that the sites of most intense star formation were typically obscured by dust (i.e.\nSanders et al. 1988; Mirabel et al. 1998; Charmandaris et al. 2004), the observed dust\nemission was used not only as a proxy of star formation rate (see F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2004), but also the estimated temperature of the various dust components was suggested\nas a tracer of the age of the last major star forming event (i.e. Charmandaris et al. 2000;\nGeorgakakis et al. 2000; Xilouris et al. 2004). This is of particular interest since there is\nample evidence that the galaxy interaction/merge rate increases sharply with redshift\nand that nearly all of the Utraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), who as we now\nknow contribute substantially towards the energy production in the Universe at z> 1.5\n(Elbaz & Cesarsky 2003), are in fact interacting systems. The launch of the Spitzer Space\nTelescope introduces major improvements in sensitivity, wavelength coverage, and spatial\nresolution in mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, and opens new avenues in using the\ndust properties towards better understanding of the properties of interacting galaxies.\n\u2020 Chercheur Associ\u00e9, Observatoire de Paris, F-75014, Paris, France, and IESL/Foundation\nfor Research and Technology-Hellas, PO Box 1527, 71110, Heraklion, Greece\n\u2021 The presentation is also available at http://www.physics.uoc.gr/\u223cvassilis/vc iau235.pdf\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nV. Charmandaris\n\n2. Results\n2.1. ISO\nIn order to quantify the variation of the global mid-infrared colors of interacting galaxies\n- beyond the seminal work of Bushouse et al. (1988) which was based on IRAS data\n- a small sample of well known interacting galaxies, for which the stage of interaction\nwas known a priori, was imaged by ISO. Extensive studies of the ISO/CAM mid-infrared\nbroad band colors indicated that one could use the ratio of the LW3(12-18 \u03bcm) to LW2(58.5 \u03bcm) flux densities as an indicator of the fraction of the very small grain continuum\nemission continuum to the PAH feature emission. The ratio is close to unity for quiescent\nstar formation but it increases to values of 3 or more in starburst systems. As we clearly\nsee from Figure 1, this ratio is correlated to the IRAS colors and varies monotonically\nwith the intensity of the star formation activity in those galaxies. This result suggests\nthat even though the bolometric luminosity of interacting luminous infrared galaxies is\nfound at \u03bb > 40\u03bcm, the study of the mid-infrared part of the spectrum can be used to\ntrace the location of the far-infrared peak.\nMerger Age\n\nNGC 3921\n\nNGC 7252\n\npost-starburst\n\nARP 220\n\nNGC 6240\n\nNGC 3256\n\nstarburst\n\nNGC 520\n\nNGC 3263\n\nNGC 4676\n\npre-starburst\n\nFigure 1. A comparison of the variation of the ISO/CAM 15\u03bcm/7\u03bcm flux ratio along the\nmerging sequence, with the well known IRAS flux ratios. Note how well the ISO/CAM starburst\ndiagnostic follows the evolution of the star forming activity/merger age of the sequence. One\nmay effectively consider the 15\u03bcm/7\u03bcm ratio as a tracer of the location of FIR peak of the\nbolometric luminosity (see Charmandaris et al. 2000).\n\n2.2. Spitzer\nThe first detailed study of the mid-infrared emission from a sample of 35 interacting\ngalaxies with the large format detector arrays of Spitzer, is presented by (Smith et al.\n2006). Some of those results are highlighted in this section, while a number of other\nmajor imaging and spectroscopy programs by Spitzer are underway. The (Smith et al.\n2006) sample was constructed from the Arp Atlas identifying nearby (v <11,000 km s\u22121 )\nbinary systems with clear signs of tidal disturbance and a total angular size of less\nthan 3\u2032 where each component was greater than 30\u2032\u2032 . A control sample of \"normal\"\nisolated nearby galaxies obtained by the SINGS legacy program was used for comparison\n(Kennicutt et al. 2003; Dale et al. 2005).\n\n\fInteracting Galaxies in the Infrared\n\n3\n\nAs indicated in Figure 2, the spatial resolution and sensitivity of Spitzer enables us\nto quantify the distribution of the infrared emission. We find that the 3.6\u03bcm emission\nfrom the tidal tails, which can be used as a proxy of their stellar mass, is \u223c7% of\nthe galaxy disks. Furthermore, less than 10% of the 24\u03bcm emission, which identifies\nenshrouded regions of massive star formation, is found outside the body of the interacting\ncomponents.\n\nFigure 2. Histogram of the FIR luminosity, in log[L\u2299 ], of the interacting galaxy sample based on\nthe global IRAS data, as well as the 3.6\u03bcm and 24\u03bcm based on the Spitzer data (see Smith et al.\n2006). The solid areas indicate upper limits. Note the extent of the 3.6 and 24\u03bcm luminosities\nof the tidal features.\n\nFigure 3. Left: Histogram of the ratio of the 24\u03bcm to FIR luminosity for all galaxies in the\nsample. Right: The 24\u03bcm central concentration index (see Smith et al. 2006)\n\nAnalyzing the mid-infrared colors and luminosities of the interacting and control sample, Smith et al. (2006) showed that the star formation rate (SFR) in the interacting\ngalaxy sample was relatively modest, \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , similar to what was found for the\nisolated \"normal\" galaxies. There was no apparent variation in the distribution of midinfrared colors for the various regions suggesting that the normalized SFR in tails and\nbridges is similar to that found on galaxy disks. No variation was either found as a function of the separation between the two interacting components. It is likely though that\n\n\f4\n\nV. Charmandaris\n\nthis result is simply due to the fact that systems in late stages of interactions/merging\nwere excluded from the interacting sample.\nDespite these similarities between the two sample, in order to investigate whether the\nArp pairs have more centrally concentrated star formation, Smith et al. (2006) evaluated\nthe 24\u03bcm nuclear emission in a region of diameter 2 kpc centered on the position of the\nnucleus of each galaxy and defined the nuclear concentration C24 to be the ratio of the\nflux in the aperture S2kpc to the total flux Stot from the galaxy. As shown in Figure 3\nthere is a clear difference in the distribution of 24\u03bcm nuclear concentrations between\nthe spirals and the Arp systems. The spirals are predominantly diffuse objects with the\nmedian value of C24 being around 0.2 (i.e., 20% of the flux coming from the inner 2kpc)\nand only tiny fraction of the systems having nuclear concentrations, whereas the Arp\nsystems show an almost flat (and slowly declining) distribution of C24 . In particular,\nlarge numbers of Arp systems (both primary and secondary galaxies) have values of C24\ngreater than 0.3 and in some cases are totally nuclear dominated. This suggests that\neven though the Arp systems have similar L24\u03bcm /LFIR luminosities they show a much\nwider distribution of 24\u03bcm nuclear concentrations, with a large excess (over the spirals)\nextending up to objects which are essentially point sources.\n\n3. Conclusions\nThe large sample of galaxies that can now be efficiently studied in the mid-infrared\nwith Spitzer is enabling us to establish for the first time well calibrated extinction free\nstar formation diagnostics in galaxies.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the ISO/CAM extragalactic team at CEA/Saclay and the\nSpitzer/IRS instrument team at Cornell and Caltech for stimulating discussions over the\npast decade.\nReferences\nBushouse, H.
