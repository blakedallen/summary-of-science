For an overview of the progress\nthat has been made to solve this problem we refer to [20]. Results for the degree 2\ncase, and a general introduction to the bifurcation theory of planar polynomial vector\nT. Johnson * W.

What is known, is that any given polynomial vector field\ncan have only a finite number of limit cycles; this is proved in [11,19].\nA restricted version of Hilbert's 16th problem, known as the weak, or sometimes\nthe tangential, or the infinitesimal, Hilbert's 16th problem, asks for the number of\nlimit cycles that can bifurcate from a perturbation of a Hamiltonian system, see e.g.\n[3]. The weak Hilbert's 16th problem has been solved for the degree 2 case, see [2].\nSpecial cases of Hamiltonian systems are those coming from a one dimensional\n2\nsystem, H(x, \u1e8b) = \u1e8b2 + h(x), which we study in the example given in Section 4.1. If\none, in addition, assumes that f = 0, and g(x, \u1e8b) = g(x)\u1e8b, (1.1) is known as a Lienard\nequation. Such equations have been thoroughly studied, and the case where dH, and\ng have degree 3 has been solved, see [6,7,8,9]. We study general g of degree 3; the\nset-up of the problem is given in Section 4.1.\nIn this paper we present a rigorous, computer-aided approach to find limit cycles\nof planar polynomial vector fields. A different computer-aided approach was introduced by Malo in his PhD-thesis [22], (also described in [15,16]) which is based\non the concept of a rotated vector field, as introduced in [5]. Our approach is completely different: we develop a method to rigorously compute what is known as an\nAbelian integral. A brief introduction to Abelian integrals is included in Section 2.\nThe concept of a computer-aided proof in analysis is based on techniques to rigorously enclose the result of a numerical computation. A basis for such a procedure is\ninterval analysis, introduced by Moore in [23]. By calculating with sets rather than\nfloating points, it is possible to obtain guaranteed results on a computer, enabling\nautomated proofs for continuous problems.\nWe emphasize that the methods developed in this paper are neither restricted to\nany specific degree of the polynomial functions f , and g, nor to the structure of the\npolynomial Hamiltonian H. It can be used to compute Abelian integrals of any polynomial perturbation from any family of compact level curves, ovals, of a polynomial\nHamiltonian. The method can be used as a computational tool to accurately describe\nthe phase portraits of a family of planar systems. In the example given in this paper,\nhowever, we restrict to the case when f = 0, and dH and g have degree 3. The method\nalso works for integrable, but non-Hamiltonian, planar polynomial systems. For such\nsystems all formulae need to adjusted to include the integrating factor.\n\n2 Abelian integrals\nA classical method to prove the existence of limit cycles bifurcating from a family\nof ovals of a Hamiltonian, \u0393h \u2282 H \u22121 (h), depending continuously on h, is to study\nAbelian integrals, or, more generally, the Melnikov function, see e.g. [3,14]. Some\ncaution, however, must be taken regarding the correspondence between limit cycles\nand Abelian integrals, see e.g. [10]. Given a Hamiltonian system and a perturbation,\n\u001a\n\n\u1e8b = \u2212Hy + \u03b5 f (x, y)\n\u1e8f = Hx + \u03b5 g(x, y),\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fOn a computer-aided approach to the computation of Abelian integrals\n\n3\n\nthe Abelian integral is defined as\nI(h) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0393h\n\nf (x, y) dy \u2212 g(x, y) dx.\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn this paper all systems and perturbations are polynomial. The most important property of Abelian integrals is described by the Poincar\u00e9-Pontryagin theorem.\nTheorem 2.1 (Poincar\u00e9-Pontryagin) Let P be the return map defined on some section transversal to the ovals of H, parametrised by the values h of H, where h is taken\nfrom some bounded interval (a, b). Let d(h) = P(h) \u2212 h be the displacement function. Then, d(h) = \u03b5 (I(h) + \u03b5\u03c6 (h, \u03b5 )),\nas \u03b5 \u2192 0, where \u03c6 (h, \u03b5 ) is analytic and\nuniformly bounded on a compact neighbourhood of \u03b5 = 0, h \u2208 (a, b).\nProof see e.g. [3].\n\n3 Computer-aided computation of Abelian integrals\n3.1 Computer-aided proofs\nTo prove mathematical statements on a computer, we need an arithmetic which gives\nguaranteed results. Many computer-aided proofs, including the results in this paper,\nare based on interval analysis, e.g. [12,17,32]. Interval analysis yields rigorous results\nfor continuous problems, taking both discretisation and rounding errors into account.\nFor a thorough introduction to interval analysis we refer to [1,23,24,25,27].\n\n3.2 Outline of the approach\nThe main idea of this paper is to develop a very accurate, validated method to enclose\nthe value of a general Abelian integral. Such a method enables us to sample values of\nI(h). If we can find two ovals \u0393h1 , and \u0393h2 , such that\nI(h1 )I(h2 ) < 0,\n\n(3.1)\n\nthen there exists h\u2217 \u2208 (h1 , h2 ), such that I(h\u2217 ) = 0.\nSince P\u03b5 , the return map of the perturbed vector field, is analytic and non-constant,\nit has isolated fixed points. Thus, we have proved the existence of (at least) one limit\ncycle bifurcating from \u0393h\u2217 .\n\n3.3 Computing the integrals\nTo compute the Abelian integral (2.2) of the form (4.6), we apply Stokes theorem to\nget\nZ\nI(h) =\n\ndw,\n\nDh\n\n(3.2)\n\n\f4\n\nTomas Johnson, Warwick Tucker\n\nwhere Dh denotes the interior of an oval \u0393h . The reason why we prefer to calculate\nsurface integrals, rather than contour integrals, is that we cannot represent the ovals\nof H exactly. We can only find a cover of the ovals, and the area of this cover yields\nthe uncertainty of our calculations, automatically handled by the interval arithmetic.\nIf we had chosen to compute contour integrals, all of our computations would have\nbeen subjected to those errors, since we would always integrate over an unknown\nlocation. When calculating surface integrals, however, the effect of the uncertainty\nof the location of the ovals only contributes on a very small portion of the total area\nof Dh . Note that, inside Dh it is possible to integrate d \u03c9 exactly, that is, there are no\ntruncation errors.\nThe actual computation of the integrals is performed in four steps; first we find\na trapping region for the interesting family of ovals, second we adaptively split this\nregion into three parts, one that covers the oval, one representing the inside and one\nrepresenting the outside, third we change the coordinates on the boxes covering the\noval in order to minimise the area of the cover, fourth we integrate d \u03c9 on the boxes\nrepresenting the inside and the cover of the oval.\nThe first step is simple, since we primarily study ovals that are situated inside\nof a homo- or heteroclinic orbit, exterior ones are only studied after choosing the\nperturbation. A short branch\u2013and\u2013bound algorithm quickly finds a box enclosing the\nhomo- or heteroclinic orbit, and its interior; this box is our initial domain used for the\nmain part of the program.\nIn the second step \u2013 the adaptive splitting of the domain \u2013 we perform a series\nof tests to determine whether a box B intersects the oval, is inside it, or outside it.\nWe start by evaluating the Hamiltonian on B using monotonicity and central forms;\nsince the Hamiltonians we study are sufficiently simple, we implement the derivatives\nsymbolically. By monotonicity we mean that if the partial derivatives are non-zero,\nthen an enclosure of H on an entire box is given by the hull of the enclosures of the\nvalues of H on the endpoints. A central form for H on a box B, with (x, y) \u2208 B is\ngiven by:\nH(x, y) + Hx (B1 , B2 )(B1 \u2212 x) + Hy(B1 , B2 )(B2 \u2212 y).\nFor a given box, H is evaluate three times; naively, with monotonicity, and using\na central forms. Finally, all three enclosures are intersected. Three cases occur: if\nH < h, then B is inside the oval, and we label B as such. If H > h then B is outside\nthe oval and we ignore it. Finally, if h \u2208 H, then we try to perform the change of\nvariables as described below. If the change of variables procedure fails, and the size\nof B is greater than some stopping tolerance, minsize, then we split the box B into\nfour parts and re\u2013examine them separately. If the size of B is smaller than minsize,\nthen it is labelled fail. If the change of variables procedure works, then we label B\nas on.\nThe third, and most complicated, part of our program is the change of variables\nin the boxes that intersect the oval. Let b \u2208 B be the midpoint of B. Compute\nu = \u2207H(b),\nand choose v such that\nu\u22a5v\n\nand v1 \u2265 0.\n\n\fOn a computer-aided approach to the computation of Abelian integrals\n\n5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\nFig. 3.1 The labelling of boxes intersecting an oval.\n\nUsing the labelling illustrated in Figure 3.1, let right and left be the sides intersected by the line b + tv, t \u2208 R. Denote the intersection points of the straight line\nb + tv with the boundary of the box by p, and q, respectively. Note that right and\nleft are different, since they are the intersections of the boundary of the box with\nthe straight line b + tv. We also remark that the possible values of right and left\nare right\u2208 {1, 2, 4} and left\u2208 {2, 3, 4}. The allowed configurations of an intersection of the oval with a box are illustrated in Figure 3.2. The restriction of H to the\nsides right and left, respectively, are one-dimensional functions, and the location\nof the intersections can be approximated, and their uniqueness proved, using the interval Newton method [23] initialised from the points p, and q, respectively. If the\ngeometry is not as in Figure 3.2, e.g. if the real intersections are on the same side,\nthen uniqueness will fail, and the box B is split, if it is larger than minsize, and\nre-examined.\nq\np\n\nq\n\np\n\nq\n\np\n\np\nq\n\np\n\np\n\nq\nq\n\nq\nq\n\np\n\np\n\nFig. 3.2 The allowed configurations of the intersection of an oval and a box.\n\nLet,\naccuracy = minsize/10.\nDefine the points pup , pdown on the right-side and the points qup , qdown on the leftside at the distance accuracy from p and q, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3.3\nfor the second case of Figure 3.2.\nIf the following conditions hold, then the oval is inside the tube illustrated in\nFigure 3.3, and we can change coordinates to get a small box, which is guaranteed\nto contain the segment of the oval passing through B. This small box represents the\nerror caused by the unknown location of the oval.\n\n\f6\n\nTomas Johnson, Warwick Tucker\npup\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\np\n\nqup\n\npdown\n\nq\nqdown\n\nFig. 3.3 Constructing a small, local enclosure of the oval.

Recall that the uniqueness of p and q is proved as they are\napproximated. Hence, we have proved that the segment of the oval crossing the box\nhas exactly two intersections with the boundary of the box, and that it is confined to\nthe region between lup and ldown .\nIf (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3), hold, then we set accuracy=accuracy/2, re-calculate\npup , pdown , qup , and qdown , and try to verify (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3). This procedure is\niterated until (3.1), or (3.2) do not hold. Finally, we label B as on.\n\n\fOn a computer-aided approach to the computation of Abelian integrals\n\n7\n\nThe fourth and final part of our integration algorithm, is the actual integration.\nThe integration is done separately for the boxes that are labelled, inside, fail, and\non.\nIf B is inside we compute\nZ\n\nxi y j dx \u2227 dy =\n\nB\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nsup(B1 )i+1 inf(B1 )i+1\n\u2212\ni+1\ni+1\n\n\u0013\n\nsup(B2 ) j+1 inf(B2 ) j+1\n\u2212\nj+1\nj+1\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.3)\n.\n\nIf B is labelled fail, we know that B might intersect the oval, that is, we have neither\nbeen able to prove intersection, nor non-intersection. Therefore, we must include any\npossible result; the integral over B is calculated as the interval hull of 0 and the largest,\nand smallest, respectively, result of (3.3) calculated on a subbox B\u0303 \u2282 B. Note that for\nboxes which intersect the x-axis or y-axis, this implies that the minus sign between\nthe terms in (3.3) is replaced by a plus sign. E.g., if a box, B, is such that 0 \u2208 B1 and\ni = 2k \u2212 1, then (3.3) is replaced by:\n\nZ\n\nx\n\n\u0013\nsup(B1 )2k inf(B1 )2k\ny dx \u2227 dy = \u00b1\n+\n2k\n2k\n\u0012\n\u0013\nj+1\nsup(B2 )\ninf(B2 ) j+1\n\u00d7\n.\n\u2212\nj+1\nj+1\n\u0012\n\n2k\u22121 j\n\nB\n\n(3.4)\n\nBoxes labelled fail cause large over-estimations.

The geometry corresponds to the second case in Figure 3.2.\n\nThe boxes that are labelled on, are split into five parts, as illustrated in Figure\n3.4. By construction, none of the triangles, Tl , Tu , or boxes Bl , Bu in the splitting of\nB intersect the oval, thus it suffices to evaluate H in one point of each, and hence\nthey can all be labelled as inside or outside. The boxes Bl , Bu are then treated as\nabove, that is, if they are labelled inside they are integrated according to (3.3), and\nif they are labelled outside they are neglected. A triangle labelled outside is also\n\n\f8\n\nTomas Johnson, Warwick Tucker\n\nneglected, the integrals on triangles labelled inside are enclosed by the formula\nZ\n\nj\n\nT\n\nxi y j dx \u2227 dy \u2208 \u0003T1i \u0003T2 |T |,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u0003T is the box hull of T , and |T | is the area of T . This gives a reasonably narrow\nenclosure of the integral, since the width of \u0003T is typically small. The parallelepiped,\nP, which covers the segment of the oval, remains to be studied. When we integrate\nover P, the same problem as in the fail case occurs; we do not know how much\nof the parallelepiped to include. Therefore, we have to take the hull of all possible\noutcomes.

From these calculations we deduce candidate coefficients.\nGiven some candidate coefficients of the form \u03c9 , we calculate the Ii j (h), at intermediate ovals. If the linear combination of the Ii j (h) has validated sign changes\nbetween the sample points we are done: it has been proved that the corresponding\nperturbation yields bifurcations with the given number of limit cycles as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nAll computations were performed on a Intel Xeon 2.0 Ghz, 64bit processor with\n7970Mb of RAM.

The corresponding differential system has two centres, at\n1\n1 3\nH = \u2212 12\n\u03bb (\u03bb + 2), that are surrounded by a figure eight\n(2\u03bb + 1), and H = \u2212 12\nloop, located at H = 0, see Figure 4.1. As \u03bb grows the right loop grows; \u03bb = 1 is a\nsymmetric figure eight loop. We choose to study \u03bb = 0.95; a motivation why we want\n\u03bb large is as follows. We want to construct a nontrivial example with as many limit\ncycles as possible. In the symmetric case the two branches are identical. Therefore,\n\n\f10\n\nTomas Johnson, Warwick Tucker\n\nheuristically, it is a reasonable that for \u03bb close to one it should be possible to choose\ncoefficients so that the two branches oscillate together. After some experiments we\ndecide to put \u03bb = 0.95, since it is relatively far away from 1 to be significantly different, but still sufficiently close to 1 for the domains of the two branches to have a large\noverlap. This allows us to locate extra limit cycles, compared to what is possible by\nsimply solving the linear system as described below.\nThe Hamiltonian (4.2) corresponds to the differential system,\n\u001a\n\u1e8b = \u2212Hy =\n\u2212y\n(4.3)\n3\n\u1e8f = Hx = x + (1 \u2212 \u03bb )x2 \u2212 \u03bb x.\nWe are interested in limit cycles bifurcating from the periodic solutions of (4.3),\ncorresponding to integral curves of (4.2). The closed level-curves of (4.2) are called\novals. In a series of papers [6,7,8,9], Dumortier and Li study cubic perturbations of\nelliptic Hamiltonians corresponding to Lienard equations. That is,\n\u1e8d + \u03b5 (\u03b1 + \u03b2 x + \u03b3 x2)\u1e8b + ax3 + bx2 + cx = 0.\n\n(4.4)\n\nFor the elliptic Hamiltonians of degree four with compact ovals, there are five\ndifferent classes of phase portraits, see e.g [3]. They are, the truncated pendulum, the\nsaddle loop. the global centre, the cuspidal loop, and the figure-eight loop.\n3\nCompared to the Lienard case, we add a fourth term, \u03b4 y3 , to the perturbation,\nand explore what kind of bifurcations we can prove to exist.

He also proves that this bound is sharp.\nTo construct an example with more than three limit cycles surrounding either of the\ntwo centres, we can therefore not simply use the Chebyshev property of the space of\nAbelian integrals.\nOur heuristic argument to guess parameters is the following: we start by integrating at 100 uniformly distributed ovals, in each eye of the loop. We do this with\nmoderate accuracy, which gives a fast and sufficiently precise result. Since we have\nchosen to study a figure eight loop that is not far from being symmetric, it is reasonable to assume that the two branches behave similarly, which makes it probable that\n\n\fOn a computer-aided approach to the computation of Abelian integrals\n\n11\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFig. 4.1 The elliptic Hamiltonian of degree 4 with a figure eight loop, studied in section 4.1.\n\nwe should be able to determine coefficients so that each branch has two zeros.

The graph of\nthe resulting function is given in Figure 4.3, which appears to have 4 zeros, illustrated\nin Figure 4.2. This, of course, has to be proved.\nTo prove that the perturbation constructed above has 4 zeros, we procede as in the\nprevious examples, and compute enclosures of the Abelian integral at intermediate\novals.

The method\ncan be applied to study any polynomial perturbation of a planar polynomial integrable\nvector field. As an application, we have applied the method to an elliptic Hamiltonian\nof degree 4.\nThe method can be used in several ways: either one can use it to verify that a\nspecific perturbation guessed by some other method indeed has a certain number of\nzeros, or one can use it as in Section 4.1 to sample and plot the monomial Abelian\nintegrals. In the latter case, if a good choice of parameters can be made from the\napproximate knowledge of the monomial Abelian integrals, then one can re-use the\nprogram to verify that guess, as is done in Section 4.1. This means that one can use the\nmethod for experimental, but rigorous, studies of the possible configurations of limit\ncycles bifurcating from a given planar polynomial Hamiltonian system. We believe\nthat enabling such rigorous studies can be very useful when studying a given system, since the phenomena are typically subtle and hard to detect using floating point\ncomputations. Without the verification step it is hard to decide from the computations\nwhat is a bifurcation, and what is just numerical noise.\nA major challenge is to device a method which can be used to guess what perturbations to investigate. One such method that appears in the literature is that of a\ndetection function, as used in e.g. [33]. Another problem, which we have ignored in\nthis paper, is that typically when one has a Hamiltonian depending on parameters, the\nmaximal number of limit cycles that can bifurcate from one member of this family,\nwill only appear for some special values of the parameters. It would therefore be desirable to develop conditions indicating how to choose one candidate system from a\n\n\fOn a computer-aided approach to the computation of Abelian integrals\n\n15\n\nfamily. In Section 4.1 we give a completely heuristic argument why we want to have\n\u03bb large. Another method to choose some of the parameters in the Hamiltonian is to\nrestrict the study to systems with maximal number of centres, i.e., of the form\n\u001a\n\u1e8b = \u2212y(y2 \u2212 b1)(y2 \u2212 b2) * * * (y2 \u2212 bk )\n(5.1)\n\u1e8f = x(x2 \u2212 a1)(x2 \u2212 a2) * * * (x2 \u2212 ak )\nwhere the ai 's and bi 's are increasing sequences of positive numbers. Different choices\nof ai and bi introduce different symmetries into the system, which can be used to find\nperturbed systems with a large number of limit cycles.\n\nReferences\n1. G. Alefeld, and J.
