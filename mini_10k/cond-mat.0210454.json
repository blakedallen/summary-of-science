INTRODUCTION\n\nThe phenomenon of charge ordering observed in Re1\u2212x Ax MnO3 where Re is a trivalent\nrare earth ion and A is a divalent alkaline earth ion has been intensively studied for the past\nfew years. This has been one of the most puzzling of the various properties exhibited by\nthe rare earth manganites such as Colossal Magneto Resistance (CMR), orbital ordering,\nphase separation and a large number of magnetic and structural transitions as a function of\ntemperature and composition1,2 . The parent compound ReMnO3 contains Mn3+ ions which\nhave one outermost eg electron. Doping with a divalent alkaline earth ion introduces Mn4+\nwith one less electron (a hole) and hence manganites with x < 0.5 are called 'hole-doped'.\nComing from the opposite end of the phase diagram the AMnO3 compound consists of all\nMn4+ ions and doping it with a trivalent rare earth ion introduces Mn3+ ions and hence\neg electrons into the system. Therefore, manganites with x > 0.5 are termed 'electrondoped'. Interestingly, the phase diagram is not symmetric across x = 0.5 concentration\nthough the number of charge carriers on both sides of x = 0.5 vary in a symmetric manner.\nBroadly speaking, the x < 0.5 region in the phase diagrams of the manganites is dominated\nby ferromagnetic interaction whereas x > 0.5 region is characterised by charge ordering.\nThe phase diagram of Pr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 (PCMO) shows charge ordering in the 0.3 < x <\n0.8 composition regime. However, the asymmetry of the phase diagram persists even in\nthe charge ordered (CO) state of x < 0.5 e.g. x=0.36(PCMO-h) and x > 0.5 compound\ne.g. x=0.64 (PCMO-e). The properties of the CO state are quite different in the two\ncompounds. The charge ordering transition temperature Tco for PCMO-h is 210 K whereas\nthat for PCMO-e is 268 K. Charge ordering in the former can be melted into a ferromagnetic\nmetallic state by doping with ions such as Cr3+ and Ru4+ by the application of magnetic\nfields whereas no such signs of melting of charge order are observed in PCMO-e. The cause\nof these differences has been attributed to the intrinsic differences in the electronic structure\n2\n\n\fof the two types of systems3 .\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) has proved to be a valuable tool in the study\nof the manganites. Through a study of the temperature and composition dependence of\nvarious EPR parameters such as the linewidth and the intensity across the various transitions\nvaluable information has been obtained regarding the interplay of different interactions in\nthe systems4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 . However most of these studies relate to CMR manganites and there\nare comparatively very few published reports of EPR studies of CO manganites12,13,14 .To\nthe best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a comparative study of electron\nand hole-doped manganites. Since the asymmetry in the phase diagram across x=0.5 is\nan interesting aspect of the physics of manganites, we compare the EPR results on the\nelectron-doped manganite Pr0.36 Ca0.64 MnO3 (PCMO-e) with those reported by us earlier12\non the hole-doped Pr0.6 Ca0.4 MnO3 (PCMO-h) with a view to understanding this asymmetry\nas reflected in the EPR parameters and their temperature dependence.\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\n\nSingle crystals of PCMO-e were prepared by the float zone technique. Resistivity measurements show an increase in the resistivity at TCO = 268 K. Magnetization measurements\nshow a peak in the susceptibility also at 268 K. However no peak in the susceptibility was\nobserved at TN unlike in PCMO-h.\nThe EPR experiments were carried out on both single crystal and powder samples of\nPCMO-e using a Bruker X - band spectrometer (model 200D) equipped with an Oxford\nInstruments continuous flow cryostat (model ESR 900). The spectrometer was modified by\nconnecting the X and Y inputs of the chart recorder to a 12 bit A/D converter which in turn\nis connected to a PC enabling digital data acquisition. With this accessory, for the scanwidth\ntypically used for our experiments i.e 6000 Gauss, one could determine the magnetic field to\na precision of 3 Gauss. For single crystal study the static magnetic field was kept parallel\nto the c-axis of the crystal. Experiments were also performed with another orientation (H\n3\n\n\fk a) to check for any anisotropy in the ESR response. For measurements on powder, the\nfinely ground sample was dispersed in paraffin wax.The temperature was varied from 4.2 K\nto room temperature (accuracy: \u00b11K) and the EPR spectra were recorded while warming\nthe sample. Signals could be recorded only for temperatures T > 200 K below which signals\nhad very poor signal to noise ratio. While doing experiments on both the single crystal and\nthe powder, a speck of DPPH was used as a g-marker. To carry out the lineshape fitting\n(to be described below) the signal due to DPPH was subtracted digitally.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 1a shows some representative EPR spectra recorded on the single crystal of\nPCMO-e. The signals are Dysonian in shape and are fitted to the equation10\ndP\nd \u2206H + \u03b1(H \u2212 H0 )\n\u2206H + \u03b1(H + H0 )\n=\n(\n+\n)\n2\n2\ndH\ndH 4(H \u2212 H0 ) + \u2206H\n4(H + H0 )2 + \u2206H 2 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206H is the full width at half intensity, H0 is the resonance field and \u03b1 is the\nasymmetry parameter which is the fraction of the dispersion component of Lorentzian added\nto the absorption component resulting in the Dysonian lineshape. In equation 1 the first term\nrepresents the signal response due to the component of microwaves that is polarised clockwise\nand the second term represents the response to the component polarised anticlockwise.\nFigure 1b shows the EPR spectra from the powder sample of PCMO-e at a few temperatures. These are Lorentzian in shape and are fitted to equation\ndP\nd\n\u2206H\n\u2206H\n=\n(\n+\n)\n2\n2\ndH\ndH 4(H \u2212 H0 ) + \u2206H\n4(H + H0 )2 + \u2206H 2 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the symbols have the same meanings as in equation 1. The two terms are incorporated\nfor the same reason as mentioned above. The lineshape parameters obtained by fitting are\nplotted in figures 2, 3 and 4 along with the data of PCMO-h\nThe single crystal parameters g, peak to peak linewidth \u2206Hpp (= \u2206H /\n\n\u221a\n\n3) and the\n\nasymmetry parameter \u03b1 obtained from the fits to equation 1 are plotted in figure 2 against\n4\n\n\ftemperature. The single crystal data of PCMO-h are also plotted in the same figure for the\npurpose of comparison.\nAs can be seen from figure 2a, the value of 'g' (2.002) in PCMO-h at room temperature is\nhigher than that in PCMO-e (1.999) which is less than the free electron value. The 'g' value\nin PCMO-e (Fig. 2a, solid squares) increases only slightly as the temperature is lowered\nfrom room temperature to Tco below which it decreases sharply. It reaches a value of 1.94\nat 200 K. This temperature dependence is quite different from that observed in the case of\nPCMO-h (Fig. 2a) where it remains nearly temperature independent in the paramagnetic\nphase, i.e, from room temperature to Tco , below which it decreases sharply to a value less\nthan the free electron 'g' value, 'ge '. With further reduction in temperature, the 'g' value\nincreases monotonically.\nThe linewidth (Fig. 2b) also behaves differently in the two manganites. In PCMO-e it\nshows a slight monotonic decrease down to 245 K below which it shows a smooth, sharper\nincrease. In PCMO-h on the other hand, there is a sharp discontinuous increase at Tco and\na monotonic increase at lower temperatures.\nThe asymmetry parameter \u03b1 plotted in figure 2c exhibits marked differences between the\ntwo samples. While it increases abruptly at Tco in PCMO-h, in PCMO-e it remains temperature independent till well below Tco , i.e, down to 245 K and then decreases monotonically\nbelow that temperature. In PCMO-h on the other hand throughout the temperature below\nTco , \u03b1 decreases monotonically.\nIn figure 3, we show the results from the powder spectra of PCMO-h and PCMO-e. The\n'g' values plotted in figure 3a show a monotonic increase as the temperature is reduced from\nroom temperature in both the compounds. The magnitude of 'g' in the former is however\ngreater than 'ge ' throughout the temperature range whereas in the latter it shows a crossover\nfrom less than 'ge ' to a value larger than 'ge ' near Tco . Also, the temperature dependence of\n'g' in the two samples is qualitatively different. The variation of 'g' from room temperature\ndown to TN is much larger in PCMO-e than in PCMO-h. Another noteworthy point is that\nthe temperature dependences of 'g' in the powder and single crystal of PCMO-e are opposite\n5\n\n\fto each other. Moreno et al.,15 observed an anisotropy in the temperature dependence of\n'g' in single crystals of layered manganite La2(1\u2212x) Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 . They observed that on\ndecreasing the temperature 'g' increases with T for Hka but decreases with T for Hkc. In\norder to examine the possibility of such an anisotropy in the single crystal of PCMO-e, we\nrepeated the experiment for Hka and found that there was no anisotropy in the variation of\n'g' with temperature. So the reasons for the difference between behaviour of 'g' in the single\ncrystal and the powder of PCMO-e are not clear at present.\nThe dependence of the peak to peak linewidth \u2206Hpp on temperature shown in figure 3b\nfor PCMO-h and PCMO-e also shows a difference below Tco in that the curvatures of the\ntwo are opposite to each other. The variation in linewidth is again larger in PCMO-e than\nin PCMO-h.\nThe EPR intensities for the two samples are plotted in figures 3c against temperature.\nIn both the samples, the intensity goes through a peak at Tco , decreasing monotonically\nbelow this temperature. However, the sharp drop in intensity found at \u223c Tco (240 K) in the\ncase of PCMO-h is not seen in PCMO-e.\nNow we attempt to understand these results in the light of the microscopic phenomena\noccurring in these systems. We focus on the temperature variation of 'g' in the powder\nsample and that of \u2206H and \u03b1 in single crystals. It was earlier observed by us that the\nhole-doped charge ordering systems exhibit certain tell-tale EPR signatures:\n\u03bb\n1. It was noted that 'g' (g = ge (1 \u00b1 k \u2206\n) where \u03bb is the spin-orbit coupling constant, k\n\nis a positive numerical factor and \u2206 is the crystal field splitting), even in the charge\ndisordered paramagnetic state, is larger than 'ge ' and on cooling stays independent of\ntemperature till Tco . Below Tco it becomes very sensitive to temperature and goes on\nincreasing with decreasing temperature. The anomalous 'g' shift (since for both Mn3+\nand Mn4+ 'g' is expected to be lower than 'ge ') can be attributed to the 'hole' nature of\nthe charge carriers since for holes in a less than half filled shell the spin-orbit coupling\nconstant \u03bb is negative16 . This conclusion is consistent with the present observation\n\n6\n\n\fthat in the system with electrons as charge carriers, 'g' is less than 'ge ' in the charge\ndisordered state. The increase in 'g' below Tco found in PCMO-h and NdCaMnO3\n(NCMO)13 was attributed to the strengthening of the spin-orbit interaction due to\norbital ordering developing between Tco and TN . However, the fact that 'g' crosses over\nto a value greater than 'ge ' in the electron-doped system and continues to increase as\nthe temperature is lowered below Tco indicates that an essentially different mechanism\nis operative in the electron-doped system. This is consistent with the suggestion by\nKhomskii17 that in these systems the concept of orbital ordering cannot be strictly\napplied.\n2. In the hole-doped PCMO and NCMO the dependence of \u2206H on T in the single crystals\nin the region TN \u2264 Tco could be explained in terms of a model involving motional\nnarrowing13 . Hopping of the Jan-Teller polarons was understood to be the underlying\nmechanism of charge transport. However, we notice in Figs. 2b, 3b and 4 that \u2206H\nvs T of PCMO-e and PCMO-h have different functional dependences on temperature.\nInterestingly we observe that the temperature dependence of \u03c1 is the same as the\ntemperature dependence of \u2206Hpp of single crystal as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. We\nfind that both the resistivity and the single crystal EPR linewidth fit the model of\nvariable range hopping (VRH)(solid line in Fig 4) given by equation\n\u2206H = K.exp(\n\nT0 1\n)4\nT\n\n(3)\n\nVRH has been used to explain the resistivity of manganites in the paramagnetic state\nby Viret et al.,18 using the concept of magnetic localisation. They found that the\ndensity of states gets modified consequent to the localisation of charge carriers due\nto Hund's coupling between the itinerant eg electrons and the stationary, core t2g\nspins. This lead to the realisation of a random potential in the paramagnetic state.\nIn case of CO manganites, in the charge ordered state a long ranged AFM order\nis not established. So the concept of random magnetic potential can be applied.\nFrom the VRH fit we obtained the parameter T0 . The localisation length is given by\n7\n\n\f1\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\nq\n3\n\nk.T0\n171.Um .v\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann factor, Um is the random magnetic potential\n\nwhich is of the order of 2 eV (Hund's coupling) and v is the volume of the unit\ncell per manganese ion which is 5.7X10\u221229 m3 . The numerical factor 171 comes from\nthe geometrical corrections due to the symmetry of dz 2 orbital of eg electron and\nthe probability that an unoccupied manganese orbital can accept an electron. The\nlocalisation length for PCMO-e thus obtained is 0.3 nm which is larger than the Mn\nionic radius (\u223c 0.8 Ao ) as expected in VRH model. While the VRH fit to \u2206Hpp vs T in\nPCMO-e is seen to be excellent, the model did not fit the linewidth data of PCMO-h\nwell (dotted line in figure 4), the regression coefficient indicative of the goodness of fit\nbeing 0.91 in the latter compared to 0.99 for the fit to the data of PCMO-e.\n3. The same conclusion i.e. the applicability of the model of motional narrowing in the\ncase of PCMO-e is borne out by the behaviour of \u03b1 as well. In case of PCMO-h an\nanomalous peak is observed in \u03b1 vs T at Tco . No such peak is observed in PCMO-e\nwhere \u03b1 decreases smoothly as \u03c1 increases below Tco as expected. In PCMO-h, the\npeak in \u03b1 was found to be correlated with the motion of the Jahn-Teller polarons. The\nabsence of such a peak in PCMO-e again points towards the negligible contribution of\nJahn-Teller polaron-mediated charge transport in this system.\nIn summary, the comparative EPR study of hole-doped and electron-doped PCMO brings\nout certain essential differences in the nature of the order and the transport mechanisms in\nthe two cases.\nAcknowledgments\nAKS and SVB thank Department of Science and Technology for financial support.
