After\nstudying several models where flows are driven by a simultaneous action of convection and rotation, it is concluded that the\ndestabilization is observed in the cases where centrifugal force acts against main convective circulation. At relatively low Prandtl\nnumbers this counter action can split the main vortex into two counter rotating vortices, where the interaction leads to instability. At\nlarger Prandtl numbers, the counter action of the centrifugal force steepens an unstable thermal stratification, which triggers RayleighB\u00e9nard instability mechanism. Both cases can be enhanced by advection of azimuthal velocity disturbances towards the axis, where\nthey grow and excite perturbations of the radial velocity. The effect was studied considering a combined convective/rotating flow in a\ncylinder with a rotating lid and a parabolic temperature profile at the sidewall. Next, explanations of the destabilization effect for\nrotating magnetic field driven flow and melt flow in a Czochralski crystal growth model were derived.\n\n1\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\nThis study is devoted to an effect of destabilization of axisymmetric natural convection flows by a weak superimposed non-\n\nuniform rotation. In classical models, such as a rotating infinite layer (see, e.g., Chandrasekhar, 1961; Koschmieder,1993; Fernando &\nSmith IV, 2001; Kloosterziel & Carnevale, 2003; Lewis, 2010) or rotating cylinders and annuli (see, e.g., Lucas et al., 1983;\nGoldstein at al., 1993, Lopez & Marquez, 2009; Rubio et al., 2010), increasing rotation usually leads to stabilization of the flow, i.e.,\nto the growth of the critical Rayleigh number or other critical parameters describing magnitude of the buoyancy force. We do not\nreview here numerous studies of the two above mentioned models, but address the reader to references in the cited papers. It seems\nthat there exists a common agreement that the effect of rotation on convective instabilities is mainly stabilizing. However, as is shown\nin this paper, such a generalization is wrong. The two above models consider classical Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard problem of stability of purely\nconducting quiescent states, while in most practically important cases, the buoyancy force is non-potential, so that natural convection\nflow always exists. Brummel et al. (2000) argued that non-uniform rotation can destabilize even stably stratified non-isothermal flow.\nReviewing several studies devoted to instabilities driven by the simultaneous effect of convection and rotation, Koschmieder (1993)\nnoted that when the rotation affects the base flow, its effect on flow instability becomes very complicated. We can add that nonuniform rotation caused by a rotating boundary or an external force complicates the stability properties of flows even more. This was\nobserved, for example, in non-isothermal Taylor-Couette flow (Ali & Weidman, 1990; Ali & McFadden, 2000), where circular\nCouette flow and an infinite convective loop were superimposed in the base flow state.\nThis study is motivated by several recent observations of destabilization of convective flow by rotation in models of\nCzochralski bulk crystal growth process (see, e.g., M\u00fcller, 2007). These models consider melt flow in a cylindrical crucible with a\n2\n\n\fheated bottom and sidewall, cooled by a rotating cold crystal pulled out from the upper free surface. In laboratory flow models, the\ncrystal is usually replaced by a cooled cylindrical dummy whose lower surface touches the free surface of working liquid. Rotation\nand lower temperature of the dummy mimic the effect of the crystal in a technological setup (Hintz et al., 2001; Schwabe et al, 2004;\nTeitel et al., 2008). The flow is driven by buoyancy, rotation of the crystal and thermocapillary force acting along the free surface.\nStability studies of these flows focus on parameters at which steady \u2013 oscillatory flow transition takes place. Different examples can\nbe found in Gelfgat (2008) and references therein. Figure 1 shows two examples of stability diagrams, in which critical temperature\ndifference \u2206Tcr, to which both Grashof and Marangoni numbers are proportional, is plotted versus the Reynolds number defined by the\nangular velocity of the dummy rotation and the crucible radius. The system geometry and an example of the flow pattern are shown in\nthe insert. Further details can be found in Teitel et al. (2008), Crnogorac et al. (2008), and Gelfgat (2008). Both examples relate to\nsimilar experiments with different working liquids with the Prandtl number Pr = 9.2 in the case (a) of Schwabe et al. (2004) and\nPr = 23.9 in the case (b) of Teitel et al. (2008). In both examples computations predict a steep decrease of \u2206Tcr with a slow increase of\nthe rotational Reynolds number up to Re= 100, which corresponds to the rotation of crystal with the angular viscosity smaller than 0.1\nand 0.5 rad/s (1 and 5 revolutions per minute) in the cases (a) and (b), respectively. Note that depending on the aspect ratio,\nisothermal swirling flow in a cylinder with a rotating lid becomes unstable for the Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 (Gelfgat\net al., 2001), so that the destabilization observed in Fig. 1 cannot be addressed to a rotation-induced instability. Note also that in spite\nof the critical temperature difference \u2206Tcr decreases in more than an order of magnitude, it never reaches zero. Therefore, it is an\ninteraction of all the driving forces that makes the flow significantly lesser stable.\n\n3\n\n\fAt the present time there is no thorough experimental evidence of the destabilization predicted by the computational\nmodelling. Some qualitative evidence of this phenomenon can be found in the observations of Teitel et al. (2008), which also support\nour computations (Fig. 1b), as well as in Kakimoto et al. (1990), Munakata & Tanasawa (1990), Ozoe et al. (1991), Kishida et al.\n(1993), Seidl et al. (1994), and Suzuki (2004). Some independent numerical results exhibiting the Czochralski flow destabilization\nwith increasing rotation can be found in Sung et al. (1995), Akamatsu et al. (1997), Zeng et al. (2003) and Banerjee & Muralidhar\n(2006). The fluid Prandtl number in these works varies from Pr = 0.011 in Kishida et al. (1993) to Pr = 23.9 in Teitel et al. (2008), and\neven Pr \u2248 4600 in Ozoe et al. (1991) and Sung et al. (1995), so that the destabilization phenomenon can be expected and, as it is\nshown below, appears in flows with significantly different Prandtl numbers.\nSince the Czochralski flow model is rather complicated, in the present study we are looking for a simpler characteristic model\nexhibiting similar destabilization and intend to study the latter to get more physical insight in the phenomenon. Considering several\nexamples of flows driven by convection and rotation we show that the simplest model exhibiting similar destabilization is a\ncombination of two well-studied cases: convective flow in a vertical cylinder with a parabolic temperature profile at the sidewall, and\nswirling flow in a cylinder with a rotating lid. The three-dimensional stability of the first one was studied in Gelfgat et al. (2000) and\nof the second one in Gelfgat et al. (2001). Examining the flow and leading disturbance patterns we arrive at the conclusion that\ndestabilization is caused by a counter action of the centrifugal force that tends to slow down the main convective vortex. This counter\naction leads either to the appearance of a new vortical structure or to a steeper temperature gradient along the axis. Consequently, the\nfollowing destabilization is connected either to an interaction between counter rotating vortices, or to the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard instability\ndeveloping below the cold upper boundary. An additional destabilization mechanism is connected to the advection of perturbations of\n4\n\n\fazimuthal velocity towards the axis, where they grow due to conservation of the angular momentum, which causes a growth of the\nradial velocity disturbances. It is emphasized that we focus here only on the phenomenon of destabilization and do not pretend to\nsupply a comprehensive description of a variety of instabilities that take place in convective, rotating, as well as combined\nconvective/rotating flows, whose variety hardly can be described within a single journal paper. On the other hand, to show that the\ndescribed destabilization phenomena can be expected in other convective/rotating flows, we add an example in which buoyancy force\ninteracts with a rotating magnetic field driving effect.\n\n2.\n\nProblems formulation and numerical technique\nWe study three-dimensional instabilities of axisymmetric non-isothermal base flows. The full three-dimensional problem is\n\ndescribed by the Boussinesq equations in cylindrical coordinates. A Boussinesq fluid with density \u03c1*, kinematic viscosity \u03bd* and\nthermal diffusivity \u03c7* in an axisymmetric region 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R \u2217 , 0 \u2264 z \u2264 H \u2217 is considered. The polar axis is assumed to be parallel to the\ngravity force. The flow is described by the momentum, continuity and energy equations in cylindrical coordinates (r*, z*). To render\n\nthe equations dimensionless, we use the scales R*, R*2/\u03bd*, \u03bd*/ R*, \u03c1*(\u03bd*/ R*)2 for length, time, velocity and pressure respectively. The\n\u2217 )\u2044(T \u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\ntemperature is rendered dimensionless by the relation T = (T \u2217 \u2212 Tcold\nhot \u2212 Tcold ), where Thot and Tcold are the maximal and\n\nminimal temperatures at the boundaries of the flow region. The set of Boussinesq equations for the non-dimensional velocity v =\n{vr , v\u03b8 , vz }, temperature \u03a4 and pressure p in the domain 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 z \u2264 A reads\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n\n+ (v \u2219 \u2207)v = \u2212\u2207p + \u2206v + GrTez + Taf(r, z)e\u03b8\n5\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u2202T\n\u2202t\n\n1\n\n+ (v \u2219 \u2207)T = Pr \u2206T,\n\n\u2207\u2219v = 0\n\n(2,3)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217 )R*3 *2\nHere A = H*/R* is the aspect ratio, Gr = g*\u03b2*(Thot\n\u2212 Tcold\n/\u03bd the Grashof number, Pr = \u03bd*/\u03c7* the Prandtl number, g* gravity\n\nacceleration, \u03b2* the thermal expansion coefficient, and ez the unit vector in the z-direction. The last term in Eq. (1) describes timeaveraged azimuthal force resulting from an externally applied rotating magnetic field (RMF), which is considered as a possible source\n\nof rotational motion in one of the examples below. This force is described by an analytical function (Gorbachev et al., 1974; Grants &\nGerbeth, 2001)\n2z \u2212 A\n2 \ufffd\nf(r, z) = r \u2212 2 \ufffd\nA\n2\nk=0 (\u03b3k \u2212 1)J1 (\u03b3k ) cosh \ufffd\u03b3k \ufffd\n2\n\u221e\n\nJ1 (\u03b3k r) cosh \ufffd\u03b3k\n\n(4)\n\nwhere J1 is the Bessel functions and \u03b3k are eigenvalues of the problem J1\u2032 (\u03b3k ) = 0. The non-dimensional parameter that defines the\n\nforce magnitude is the magnetic Taylor number Ta = \u03c9\u2217 \u03c3 \u2217 B0\u22172 R \u22172\u2044(2\u03c1\u03bd \u22172 ), where B0\u2217 and \u03c9\u2217 are the magnitude and rotational\nfrequency of the magnetic field, and \u03c3 \u2217 is the electric conductivity of the fluid. Additionally, if the top or bottom of the cylinder rotate\n\nwith an angular velocity \u03a9, we define the rotational Reynolds number as Re = \u03a9R \u22172 \u2044\u03bd . Since the models considered below do not\ninclude background uniform rotation, we do not include centrifugal buoyancy effects in our formulation (see, e.g., Lopez & Marques,\n2009; Rubio et al., 2010). The boundary conditions will be specified below, separately for each problem.\nWe study instability of steady axisymmetric flows {V, P, T}, V = (U, V, W) with respect to infinitesimally small three-\n\ndimensional disturbances, which are decomposed into a Fourier series in the azimuthal direction and are represented as\n\u2211m=+\u221e\n\ufffdm , p\ufffdm , T\ufffdm } exp(\u03bbt + m\u03b8), where \u03bb is a complex amplification rate, v\ufffd = (u\ufffd, v\ufffd, w\n\ufffd), p\ufffd and T\ufffd are perturbation of the velocity,\nm=\u2212\u221e{v\n6\n\n\fpressure, and temperature, respectively. The subscript m denotes the m-th Fourier mode of a corresponding function. It is well-known\nthat the linear stability problem separates for each m, which is an integer azimuthal wavenumber. Therefore, after an axisymmetric\nsteady state is computed, solution of the stability problem is reduced to a series of 2D-like generalized eigenvalue problems defined\nfor the eigenvalues \u03bb separately at different azimuthal wavenumbers m (see, e.g., Gelfgat, 2007). The steady flow is unstable when at\nleast one \u03bb exists with a positive real part. The eigenvalue with the largest real part is called leading and parameters at which the\nleading eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis are called critical.\nTo calculate steady states of Eqs. (1)-(3) and to study their linear stability with respect to three-dimensional infinitesimal\ndisturbances, we use the finite volume discretization and the technique described and verified in Gelfgat (2007). The test calculations\nperformed there showed that to keep critical parameters within 1% accuracy, one needs to apply at least 100 grid points in the shortest\nspatial direction. Note that our stability results for isothermal flow in a cylinder with a rotating top were successfully compared with\nseveral independent computations (Gelfgat, 2002) and were validated experimentally by S\u00f8rensen et al. (2006). The results for\nstability of convective flow in a side-heated cylinder are also well-compared with the independent result of Gemeny et al. (2007).\nTogether with the convergence studies (Gelfgat, 2007) these make us confident in the accuracy of the results reported below. In the\nfollowing calculations, the size of the stretched finite volume grid varies from Nr = 100 to 300 points in the radial direction. The grid\nsize in the axial direction is taken as Nz = ANr . The grid size is chosen to ensure convergence to at least three correct decimal places\nin the calculated critical parameters.\n\n7\n\n\f3. Instability of axisymmetric flows driven by buoyancy convection and rotation: examples\nTo explain the destabilization described in the Introduction, we seek a simple model flow, which exhibits similar phenomenon,\ni.e., destabilization of convective circulation by slow rotation that takes place in a wide range of the Prandtl numbers. It can be easily\nchecked that the steep destabilization of Czochralski flow persists if the thermocapillary force is set to zero. Therefore,\nthermocapillarity can be excluded from a qualitative model we are trying to find. We also exclude the classical Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard\nconfiguration of the cylinder with an isothermal top and bottom, since this problem can lead to multiple secondary states (Boronska &\nTuckerman, 2010), so that each distinct steady state branch will be affected differently by the same rotational forcing. In this study we\nprefer to refrain from configurations allowing for multiple steady states. Figures 2-4 represent several characteristic examples that\nillustrate the existence or absence of the destabilization and help us to focus on a model that seems to be the most appropriate for our\npurposes. Stability diagrams shown in these figures for different thermal boundary conditions and different Prandtl numbers are\nsupplied by examples of streamlines and isotherms.\nIt should be noticed that almost all instabilities observed are oscillatory, i.e., the corresponding leading eigenvalue has a nonzero imaginary part. The imaginary part estimates the frequency of appearing oscillations. The latter is not shown on separate graphs\nbecause it does not relate directly to the destabilization effect discussed. It is quite obvious that if a perturbation is not axisymmetric\n(m\u22600) and the base flow has a non-zero azimuthal component, then the non-axisymmetric perturbation pattern is advected around the\naxis, which makes steady three-dimensional instability impossible for Re\u22600. Therefore, steady bifurcation can appear either for the\naxisymmetric Fourier mode m=0 or for non-rotating basic flows at Re=0. Among the results shown in Figs. 2-4 only four points\n\n8\n\n\fcorrespond to the steady instability: in Fig. 2a point Retop=0, Pr=0.7; in Fig. 3c two points at Rebottom=0; and in Fig. 4c the point\nRetop=0. All the other points on the neutral stability curves correspond to the oscillatory instability.\nIn all the cases we impose no-slip boundary conditions on all the boundaries. Assuming that either the top or bottom of the\ncylinder rotates with a constant angular velocity, \u03a9top or \u03a9bottom, respectively, the boundary conditions read\nat r = 1:\nat z = 0:\n\nat z = A:\n\nvr = v\u03b8 = vz = 0\n\nvr = vz = 0,\n\nvr = vz = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nv\u03b8 = Rebottom r\n\n(6)\n\nv\u03b8 = Retop r\n\n(7)\n\nThe temperature boundary conditions will be defined separately for each problem. Additionally, they are summarized in Table 1\ntogether with parameters at which the flow patterns are reported in Figs. 2-4. The critical azimuthal wavenumbers mcr as well as\nvalues of the Prandtl number and the aspect ratio, are shown in the figures.\nFigures 2a and 2b show stability diagrams for vertical cylinders non-uniformly heated from below: by a parabolic radial\ntemperature profile (Fig. 2a)\n\nT(r, z = 0) = 1 \u2212 r 2 ,\n\nand by heating of a half-radius inner part of the boundary (Fig. 2b)\nT(r \u2264 0.5, z = 0) = 1,\n\nT(r, z = A) = 0,\n\nT(r > 0.5, z = 0) = 0,\n9\n\n\u2202T\n\n\ufffd\u2202r \ufffd\n\nr=1\n\nT(r, z = A) = 0,\n\n=0\n\u2202T\n\n\ufffd\u2202r \ufffd\n\n(8)\n\nr=1\n\n=0.\n\n(9)\n\n\fIn both cases the convective flow is affected by rotation of the upper boundary (Rebottom = 0). In both cases the fluid driven by the\n\nbuoyancy force rises along the axis and descends along the sidewall. The rotation of the top creates a centrifugal force that pushes the\n\nfluid from the center to the sidewall along the upper boundary, and therefore intensifies the convective circulation. Depending on the\nPrandtl number, we observe either existence or absence of destabilization of convection by rotation. Surprisingly, in the case of Fig. 2a\nthe destabilization exists for larger Prandtl number, Pr = 7, while in the case of Fig. 2b \u2013 for the smaller Prandtl number, Pr = 0.7. In\nthese cases the critical Grashof number can be reduced by approximately four to five times. Thus, these two examples show that a\nsignificant destabilization can be observed at certain conditions, but its existence depends on the ratio of momentum and heat\ndissipation, i.e., the Prandtl number, so that no general conclusion can be drawn and each particular case should be studied separately.\nWe conclude that these two models are not the characteristic model we are looking for.\nFigure 2c presents another example where the convective circulation is created by a parabolic temperature profile at the\ncylinder sidewall, while the top and bottom remain at a low constant temperature\nT(r, z = 0) = T(r, z = A) = 0,\n\nT(r = 1, z) = 4z(1 \u2212 z).\n\n(10)\n\nIn this case the fluid ascends along the sidewall and descends along the cylinder axis. Stability of this convective flow was studied by\nGelfgat et al. (2000). For the purposes of this study we affect the convective circulation by an azimuthal RMF force (4) keeping\nRebottom = Retop = 0. Three-dimensional instability of the isothermal RMF-driven rotating flow was studied by Grants & Gerbeth\n(2002), who showed that the critical magnetic Taylor number exceeds the value of Ta = 105. In our example the Taylor number does\n\nnot exceed 104, so that the RMF-driven flow instabilities do not develop. Again, we observe that a relatively weak RMF force with\n\n10\n\n\fTa \u2248 103 leads to a decrease of the critical Grashof number by more than five times. At larger Taylor numbers, beyond the minimum,\nGrcr monotonically grows with the increase of Ta. Note that the observed destabilization takes place with the convective circulation\nrotating in the opposite direction compared to Figs. 2a and 2b. Moreover, unlike the examples in Figs. 2a and 2b, the RMF force\ndrives rotation of the whole fluid volume, so that the angular velocity grows from the no-slip top and bottom towards the midplane\nz = 0.5, where the centrifugal force attains its maximal value. Thus, without convection or at larger Ta the meridional flow consists of\ntwo circulations (Grants & Gerbeth, 2001); the insert in Fig. 2c corresponding to Ta=104 shows the beginning of the second\ncirculation development. This example shows again that destabilization of convective circulation by a weak non-uniform rotation is a\nrather common phenomenon and is not necessarily connected with a rotation of one of boundaries. Formally, we can consider the\nRMF-driven flow also at the larger Prandtl number. However, it would be meaningless because the Prandtl number of electrically\nconducting fluids does not exceed 0.1.\nFigures 3 and 4 present stability diagrams for the convective flow resulting from the same sidewall parabolic heating, as in Eq.\n(10) and Fig. 2c and affected by rotation of either the bottom (Fig. 3) or the top (Fig. 4). Frames (a), (b), and (c) correspond to\ndifferent Prandtl numbers 0.015, 0.7 and 7, respectively. In addition, Fig. 4a contains the neutral curve for a limit case Pr = 0, that\ncorresponds to a very large thermal diffusivity. Note that at smaller Prandtl numbers, that can be interpreted as fluids with smaller\nviscosity, we consider larger intervals of the Reynolds number to cover all the values of our interest.\nIt can be stated immediately that no significant destabilization is observed when the convective flow is affected by rotation of\nthe bottom boundary (Fig. 3). A slight destabilization for Pr = 0.015 cannot be compared to what was observed in Figs. 1 and 2. In the\ncase of a rotating bottom the centrifugal force drives the flow from the axis towards the sidewall along the bottom and therefore\n11\n\n\fintensifies the convective circulation. In spite of that at Pr = 0.7 and 7 we observe stabilization of the flow. At larger Prandtl numbers\n(Fig. 3c, Pr = 7 ) the instability sets in as a spoke pattern, which is illustrated by the temperature perturbation isolines plotted in an\naxial cross-section just below the upper boundary. This type of instability was observed experimentally and numerically by Gelfgat et\nal. (1999), where we argued that it is caused by the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard mechanism developing in the upper unstably stratified flow\nregion. Some more details on this instability were reported later by Szmyd et al. (2002). It also follows from Fig. 3b that weak bottom\nrotation can trigger the spoke pattern instability, which is a result of intensifying heat convection and thinning of the thermal boundary\nlayer near the upper boundary.\nA combination of the parabolic sidewall heating and rotation of the top yields the desirable effect (Fig. 4): independent on the\nPrandtl number, a relatively weak rotation destabilizes the convective circulation so, that the critical Grashof number decreases in\nabout an order of magnitude. In this case the centrifugal force drives the flow from the axis to the sidewall along the upper boundary,\nso that it counteracts the convective circulation. As a result, at small Re we observe a retardation of the flow near the top, and with\nfurther increase of the Reynolds number an opposite circulation develops. This configuration is similar to the Czochralski flow model\n(Fig. 1), motivating our study by exhibiting the steep destabilization of convection by rotation, as well as by relative action of the\nbuoyancy and centrifugal forces. The destabilization is observed in a wide range of the Prandtl numbers. We consider this case as the\ncharacteristic one and will study it in detail below.\nAnother similarity between the Czochralski configuration and the one chosen as \"characteristic\" can be observed in the pattern\nof supercritical oscillatory flow (Fig. 5). Shlieren visualizations made by Teitel et al. (2008) revealed so-called \"cold plumes\"\ninstability, where cold fluid accumulates near the upper cold boundary and then descends towards the bottom. A similar instability\n12\n\n\fwas observed by Munakata & Tanasawa (1990) but for much larger Prandtl number, Pr=1000 (see Fig. 2 of Teitel et al., 2008 and\nFigs. 5 and 6 of Munakata & Tanasawa, 1990, and multimedia files related to our Fig. 5). A time-dependent calculation for our\ncharacteristic model (Fig. 5b) also reveals a cold plume descending from the upper towards the lower boundary. Note that an attempt\nto reveal cold plumes from linear stability analysis only is not always successful. This is shown in Fig. 5a where supercritical\noscillatory flow is approximated by a superposition of the base flow and the most unstable perturbation. The perturbation amplitude at\na small supercriticality can be calculated as in Gelfgat et al. (1996). For present illustration purposes the supercriticality was taken\nsmall enough to keep the temperature in the interval 0 \u2264 T \u2264 1. The superposition also reveals plumes of cold fluid descending along\nthe axis, however it does not reveal the cold thermal shapes observed in Fig. 5b and experiments of Teitel et al., 2008 (see also\n\nmultimedia files related to Fig. 5). This example shows, in particular, how cautious one should be when the linear stability results are\nextrapolated into a non-linear regime, and vice versa when linear instability arguments are derived from fully nonlinear observations.\n\n4. More details on destabilization mechanisms\n4.1. The characteristic model\nIn the following study of mechanisms that cause destabilization of convective flow, we take into account that in all the cases\nreported in Fig. 4 the rotation is slow. In fact, the critical Reynolds number of the corresponding swirling isothermal flow is beyond\n2000 (Gelfgat et al., 2001), so that one cannot expect appearance of any purely rotation induced instabilities for Re\u2264600. With this in\nmind, we focus on three general possibilities. The destabilization can be caused either (i) by alteration of a leading disturbance by\n\n13\n\n\frotation making it unstable, (ii) by alteration of the base meridional flow pattern that leads to a destabilization of one of the leading\neigenmodes, and (iii) by a new eigenmode whose appearance is caused by the base rotational motion. Note that in the option (i) we\nassume that a decaying disturbance existing without rotation is thereby destabilized, while alteration of the base meridional flow\nseems to be negligible. In the option (ii), we expect to notice some considerable changes in the meridional flow and assume that if a\nsimilar base flow existed without rotation it would be destabilized by a similar meridional disturbance. Finally, in the option (iii) we\nexpect to observe an eigenmode that does not exist in the non-rotational case. Obviously, these possibilities relate to each other and\ncan exhibit a variety of changes in the patterns of the base flows and perturbations. Moreover, we can expect a simultaneous\nobservation of different possibilities, which would result in their interaction.\nTo illustrate some of the above destabilization possibilities, we choose several characteristic points on the neutral stability curves\nof Fig. 4 and continue the study in the following way. First, we exclude from the linearized stability problem the terms containing the\nbase azimuthal velocity component V, and observe changes in the critical Grashof numbers (Table 2). A significant increase in the\ncritical value would indicate on the term or terms contributing to the destabilization. Additionally we consider the terms\n\ne\u03b8 U \u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r and e\u03b8 W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z that describe advection of the azimuthal velocity perturbation by the meridional flow. A significant\n\nstabilization observed when these terms are switched off would indicate on the importance of the azimuthal velocity perturbation for\n\nthe whole instability mechanism. Second, we plot the patterns of base flows at the same Grashof number with and without rotation to\nvisualize alterations the rotation produces. Third, we plot the absolute values of the leading eigenvector of the linearized stability\nproblem, which describe the distribution of oscillation amplitudes in the meridional plane. To simplify further explanations, the\n\n14\n\n\fperturbation patterns are plotted together with the base flow streamlines. Together with the two previous steps, it allows us to derive\nsome conclusions about the destabilization mechanisms. All the cases described and the conclusions derived are summarized in Table\n3.\nWe start the discussion from the case Pr=0 (Fig. 4a), for which temperature perturbations do not play any role and the instability is\nof purely hydrodynamic nature. We consider point A on the corresponding neutral stability curve in Fig. 4a, which is located on a\nsteeply decaying branch. Observations of switching on and off different terms of the linearized problem (Table 2) can be summarized\nas follows. Stabilization is observed when the terms containing either perturbation of the azimuthal velocity v\ufffd (case 14) or the base\nazimuthal velocity component (cases 5,7,11, 16,17), or both (cases 9,12,15) are switched off. The largest stabilization is observed in\n\nthe cases 12 and 15 when all or almost all the convective terms of the linearized azimuthal equation are switched off. This shows that\nthe destabilization is caused by advection of the base rotation, as well as its disturbance. There exists also a weaker stabilization\nconnected with the switching of the terms related to the meridional flow (cases 16-18): switching of one or both of the terms\ncontaining the base and perturbed azimuthal velocity components imu\ufffdVer \u2044r and 2v\ufffdVer \u2044r also leads to almost a doubling of Grcr.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation, we refer to Fig. 6 where flow and perturbation patterns are presented.\n\nIn the upper part of the cylinder, where the radial velocity component is negative, the meridional flow advects the azimuthal\nmomentum from the sidewall towards the axis (Fig. 6a). The rotational velocity in this region is maximal near the sidewall, and with\nthe decrease of r attains a local minimum and a local maximum reaching the zero value at the axis (Fig. 6e). Since the angular\nmomentum tends to be preserved, the advection of rotation from the sidewall towards the axis necessarily leads to the growth of\n\n15\n\n\fangular velocity. This is the reason for the appearance of the local maximum in the isolines of Fig. 6e, but also can lead to a growth of\nazimuthal velocity perturbations. In fact, we observe a local maximum of the azimuthal velocity perturbation amplitude on the\nstreamlines corresponding to the flow descending along the axis (Fig. 6b). Location of the maximum near the bottom shows that the\ninstability relates to the advection of rotation by both radial and axial components of the meridional flow, as is observed in the cases\n12-15 of Table 2. A strong perturbation of the radial velocity (Fig. 6c) located at the descending part of the main vortex can be a\nconsequence of the perturbed centrifugal force. Our description of this destabilization mechanism is supported also by the absence of\nstrong perturbations of the axial velocity in the discussed region. We attribute this instability to the appearance of a new unstable\neigenmode, which corresponds to the option (iii) described above. The latter is seen also from the stability diagram in Fig. 4a: the\ndestabilization starts at Re\u2248175 when a mode with mcr=4 unstable at Re=0 is replaced by a mode with mcr =2.\nComparing streamlines of the flow with and without rotation (Fig. 6a), we observe that as a result of the counter action of the\nbuoyancy and centrifugal forces, the main convective circulation weakens. Thus, the minimal value of the stream function at Re=0 is \u2013\n36.9, while at Re=250 it is \u201331.8. Retardation of the buoyancy convective circulation leads also to the appearance of the two counterrotating vortices in the upper corner and in the lower part of the cylinder near its axis. A strong perturbation of the axial velocity is\nobserved at the boundary separating the lower counter rotating vortex and the main circulation (Fig. 6d). The corresponding\nperturbations of two other components are weaker and are shifted downwards. It is emphasized that such a growth of perturbations at\nthe boundary separating two counter rotating vortices was observed also in many other configurations. Nienh\u00fcser and Kuhlmann\n(2002) observed similar perturbations located on a similar toroidal vortex without base flow rotation. They argued that the instability\nis caused by a centrifugal mechanism appearing when the streamline makes a turn from the vertical descending to the radial direction.\n16\n\n\fThis instability mechanism is attributed mainly to the meridional component of the flow. Our observation for the cases 16-18 shows\nthat a slow rotation can destabilize also this mechanism. The destabilization is possibly connected with deformation of a threedimensional perturbation of radial and axial velocities by advection around the axis caused by the non-uniform rotation. Since this\nmechanism results from the change of the base meridional flow, we attribute it to the option (ii). Thus, already in this case we observe\na simultaneous appearance of the options (ii) and (iii).\nIn order to gain more understanding of the destabilization mechanisms, we observed the perturbation patterns calculated with\nswitched off terms for the cases when it leads to stabilization (Table 2). In all the cases, the patterns remained similar to those shown\nin Fig. 6. We also tried to assign to the terms e\u03b8 u\ufffd \u2202V\u2044\u2202r, e\u03b8 u\ufffd V \u2044r, e\u03b8 U \u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r, and e\u03b8 W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z an amplitude \u03b5 varying between\n\n0 and 1, and to monitor the change of critical parameters and the perturbations when these terms are being diminished continuously.\nFor all the above terms, we have observed continuous change of the critical Grashof number and critical frequency along with a slight,\n\nbut definitely not qualitative, change in the disturbances pattern. This allows us to argue that the instability observed is generally a 3D\ninstability of the meridional flow, for which disturbances of the azimuthal velocity component always exist. The destabilization by a\nslow non-uniform rotation takes place because it causes a faster growth of perturbations of the azimuthal velocity.\nAnalyzing the results of Table 2 for Pr\u22600, we notice first, that switching off the term imVT\ufffd in the linearized energy equation does\n\nnot lead to stabilization in all the cases considered. We conclude that alteration of temperature perturbation by weak rotation is not a\nreason for the destabilization observed. We must keep in mind, however, that the perturbation pattern can change due to temperature\nchanges in the base flow pattern.\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 7 shows the flow and perturbation patterns for parameters of point B in Fig. 4b. In this case the streamlines and isotherms\ncorresponding to Re=0 and 200 are only slightly different (Fig. 7a and 7b). Minimal values of the stream function are \u201313.9 and \u201313.5\nfor Re=0 and Re=200, respectively. Since the effect of weak rotation on the temperature perturbations is already ruled out, the\ndestabilization should be attributed to the velocity perturbations. Strong perturbations of radial and azimuthal velocities localized near\nthe axis (Fig. 7d and 7f) can be caused by a steep increase of the azimuthal velocity observed in the same region (Fig. 7c). This\nassumption is supported by two additional facts. First, analysis of the leading eigenmodes for the base flow without rotation (Re=0)\ndoes not reveal any mode similar to the observed one, which connects this mode to the motion in the azimuthal direction, and assigns\nit to the option (iii). Second, switching off the term e\u03b8 u\ufffd \u2202V\u2044\u2202r in the azimuthal component of the momentum equation, rather than\n\nthe Coriolis term e\u03b8 u\ufffd V \u2044r, leads to the stabilization (Table 2, case 5). This indicates on the importance of radial non-uniformity of the\n\nazimuthal velocity for appearance of this instability. A sharp maximum of the azimuthal velocity perturbation located near the axis\n(Fig. 7f) also destabilizes the flow: we observe a strong destabilization when the terms e\u03b8 U \u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r and e\u03b8 W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z are switched\noff. These terms become significant because of the steep increase of the amplitude of v\ufffd near the axis.\n\nFurther, we note that switching off the term corresponding to disturbance of the centrifugal force, 2v\ufffdVer \u2044r, destabilizes the flow\n\nfurther (Table 2, case 17), so that perturbed centrifugal force acts here as a stabilizing factor. The stabilization of flow happens when\nwe switch off the term imu\ufffd Ver \u2044r (Table 2, cases 18 and 20) that describes advection of radial velocity disturbances in the azimuthal\n\ndirection. Since perturbations of the axial velocity in the discussed region are weak, the instability should be described via an\ninteraction between the radial and azimuthal velocity disturbances. One can imagine a feedback mechanism in which an azimuthal\n\n18\n\n\fvelocity perturbation is advected towards the axis where it grows due to conservation of the angular momentum and is advected\ndownwards by the main convective circulation. This gives rise to the growth of radial and azimuthal velocity perturbations along the\ndescending streamline. The maximum of the axial velocity disturbance observed in the bottom\u2013axis corner results either from the\nadvection of r- and \u03b8-velocity perturbations downwards via continuity, or from an instability developing during the meridional\nstreamline, turning from negative axial to positive radial direction that can be caused by the above mentioned Taylor-Couette\nmechanism discussed by Nienh\u00fcser and Kuhlmann (2002). In the latter case, a similar instability must be observed also without\nrotation. The examination of eigenmode patterns at Re=0 rules out the second possibility. We assume that the observed maximum of\nthe axial velocity perturbation is also caused by the base flow rotational component. This assumption is supported also by the results\nof Table 2: switching off the term imVw\n\ufffd in the axial component of the momentum equation leads to a significant stabilization (Table\n2, cases 19 and 20).\n\nExamination of changes of the perturbation patterns when terms of the cases 5, 8, 14, 18, and 19 were reduced by introducing of an\nartificial amplitude \u03b5, 0\u2264\u03b5\u22641, showed that the eigenmode reported in Fig. 7 disappears when the amplitude of either of the terms\ne\u03b8 u\ufffd \u2202V\u2044\u2202r, (U\u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r + W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z)e\u03b8 , and (imu\ufffdV + 2v\ufffdV) er \u2044r is reduced below \u03b5=0.7, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively. Switching off\n\nthe terms in the cases 8 and 19, for which stabilization is also observed, does not change the leading eigenmode pattern. These\nobservations support the above assumption of the instability mechanism: the term e\u03b8 u\ufffd \u2202V\u2044\u2202r causes the growth of the azimuthal\n\nvelocity perturbation, the terms (U\u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r + W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z)e\u03b8 advect this perturbation along the main convective vortex, and the terms\n\n19\n\n\f(imu\ufffdV + 2v\ufffdV) er \u2044r cause the growth of perturbations of the radial velocity, which yields the necessary feedback mechanism for the\nappearance of sustainable oscillations.\n\nConsidering the point C on the lowest branch of the stability diagram of Fig. 4b, we observe a rather strong deformation of the\npurely convective flow by rotation (Fig. 8). Such a deformation is expected since we simultaneously reduce the Grashof and increase\nthe Reynolds number. The minimum of the meridional stream function changes from \u20138.99 at Re=0 to \u20134.08 at Re=300, while another\ncounter-rotating vortex, whose stream function maximum is 3.31, develops in the upper corner. In this case we observe the localized\nmaximum of perturbations of axial and azimuthal velocity components located on the zero streamline separating two counter rotating\nvortices. The maxima of azimuthal velocity and temperature perturbations are located very close and slightly shifted into the area\noccupied by the weaker vortex. Two maxima of the radial velocity disturbance are shifted aside from the boundary with the larger\nmaximum inside the weaker vortex. Here the instability should be attributed to the interaction of the two vortices. Since the splitting\nof the main buoyancy vortex is a clear result of superimposed convection and rotation this instability relates to option (ii).\nExamination of Table 2 shows, however, that excluding of several or all terms containing the base azimuthal velocity from the \u03b8component of the linearized momentum equation stabilizes this flow (cases 9 and 11). A switching off the term imu\ufffd Ver \u2044r from the\n\nradial component stabilizes it even stronger (case 16). A strong stabilization is observed also when the terms e\u03b8 U \u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r and\ne\u03b8 W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z corresponding to the perturbation of azimuthal velocity are switched off (case 14). Furthermore, switching off either of\n\nthe terms imu\ufffd Ver \u2044r, e\u03b8 U \u2202(rv\ufffd)\u2044\u2202r and e\u03b8 W \u2202v\ufffd\u2044\u2202z or their combinations does not qualitatively change the perturbation pattern\n\n20\n\n\fshown in Fig. 8. Thus, these terms are responsible for destabilization of the flow, but not for the appearance of the perturbation mode.\nConversely, switching off all the terms containing V and e\u03b8 (case 11) does change the disturbances pattern.\nWe can assume that instability of the vortices boundary is intrinsically three-dimensional, which implies a non-zero perturbation of the\nazimuthal velocity. Moreover, this instability sets in when a strong advection of perturbations in the azimuthal direction by the base\nnon-uniform rotation takes place. Therefore, this case can be interpreted as a simultaneous appearance of the options (ii) and (iii).\nThe case of a larger Prandtl number, Pr=7, is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 corresponding to the points D and E in Fig. 4c. In this\ncase the spoke pattern instability observed for 0\u2264Re<30 with mcr=10 or 11 is replaced by another one, having mcr=1 and exhibiting a\nsteep decrease of the critical Grashof number from Grcr\u22482.5\u00d7104 at Re\u224830 to Grcr\u2248104 at Re\u224847. Note that this mode crosses the Re=0\naxis at Gr\u22484.7\u00d7104, so that in the absence of rotation it is less unstable than the spoke pattern mode. At Re\u224847 this mode is replaced\nagain by the axisymmetric one (mcr=0) that continues to even smaller values of Gr reaching Grcr\u22483000 at Re\u224851.5 . With further\nincrease of the Reynolds number the critical Grashof number slowly grows and several other mode switches take place.\nConsidering the example of flow and perturbation patterns shown in Fig. 9 we note that the striking feature of this case is the\nalmost unchanged streamline and isotherm patterns corresponding to the zero and non-zero Reynolds numbers. In fact, the Reynolds\nnumber is very small, so that taking the characteristic length 10 cm and the viscosity of water \u224810-6 m2/s, Re\u224835 would correspond to\napproximately 0.2 rpm. It is really difficult to see what could change in the flow to so strongly affect its stability properties. One of\npossible explanations is the following. The temperature perturbation of the destabilized flow (Fig. 9c) is located near the axis in the\narea of unstable temperature stratification and can be driven by the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard instability mechanism. The spoke pattern\n\n21\n\n\finstabilities also appear due to the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard mechanism, but their disturbances are located mainly in the thinner unstable layer\ncloser to the cylindrical wall (Gelfgat et al., 1999). The Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard driven instabilities located near the axis were also observed\nin the considered configuration without rotation, but in taller cylinders (Gelfgat et al., 2000). Therefore, we observe here two\ncompeting instability modes. The examination of isotherms (Fig. 9b) shows that while unstably stratified temperature near the\nsidewall is unaltered by the rotation, the temperature change along the axis slightly steepens, which is seen as a slight raise of a point\nwhere two upper isotherms arrive to the axis. In Fig. 11 the axial temperature gradient of flows at several critical points are compared\nwith those calculated at the same Grashof numbers but with zero rotation rate. We observe that the axial gradients at the instability\npoints are always slightly steeper than those corresponding to zero rotation cases.\nOn the basis of the above, we can offer the following explanation of the observed destabilization. We assume that in a wide range\nof Grashof numbers the growth rate of the mode shown in Fig. 9 is negative but close to zero, so that this disturbance mode does not\nbecome unstable. A slow rotation of the upper boundary creates a small change in the base flow that makes the disturbance unstable.\nThe rotation slows down the axially directed radial flow along it. Consequently, the descending flow along the axis also slows down.\nAs a result, the convective mixing near the axis reduces, which leads to steeper axial temperature gradients. When, with the increase\nof the Reynolds number, the unstable temperature gradient exceeds a certain critical average value the instability sets in. We observe\nthat at larger Grashof numbers lower axial gradient is critical (Fig. 11), which is quite expected and results from the dependence of the\ngrowth rate on the base flow.\nThe explanation offered assigns the observed destabilization to the option (ii), however, examination of Table 2 shows that it may\nbe incomplete. Switching off some terms with the base rotation and their combinations (cases 2, 13, and 20), as well as a term\n22\n\n\fdescribing the axial advection of the azimuthal velocity perturbation (case 10) can lead to a noticeable stabilization which, however, is\nmuch weaker than those observed for smaller Prandtl numbers. The pattern of the base azimuthal velocity (Fig. 9g) shows that in the\nupper region it is strongly advected towards the axis. The maximum of the azimuthal velocity perturbation amplitude is also located\nnear the axis and is shifted towards the bottom by the meridional flow. As it was discussed above, such an advection tends to\ndestabilize the flow, and we observe maxima of the meridional components perturbations located near the axis (Fig. 9d and 9e). Since\nthe rotation is very weak, we assume that this effect is secondary, but appearance of this additional destabilization can explain why the\ndifference between stable and unstable axial temperature gradients (Fig. 11) is so small. This assumption is supported by the\nobservation of the disturbances pattern: in all the cases of Table 2 where stabilization was observed the patterns of leading eigenmode\nwere similar.\nThe three-dimensional unsteady temperature pattern that results from the above instability mode is illustrated in Fig. 11 by a\ntemperature isosurfaces corresponding to T=0.3. We observe that the isosurface forms a thin tube that rotates along the axis. Such an\ninstability pattern was observed in experiments of Hintz et al. (2001) and Teitel et al. (2008), where it was called \"cold jet\" or\n\"oscillatory jet\" instability.\nAt the point E of Fig. 4c the critical Grashof number is already reduced to Grcr=5819. Since the buoyancy force in this case is\nmuch weaker, the effect or rotation becomes stronger, as is reflected in the streamline and isotherm patterns (Fig. 10a and 10b). Again,\nwe observe a steepening of the unstable temperature gradient at the axis, which in this case leads to the so-called \"cold thermals\"\ninstability, which is also of the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard nature. Here the cold fluid is advected along the upper surface towards the axis where\nunstable stratification triggers the instability, appearing as a rapid descent of the cold fluid along the axis and oscillations of the main\n23\n\n\fconvective vortex. Note large temperature disturbances located below the upper surface and near the axis (Fig. 10c), as well as radial\nvelocity perturbations near the upper and lower boundaries (Fig. 10d), and also the axial velocity perturbations near the axis (Fig.\n10e). An additional illustration is presented in Fig. 13 by the isotherm snapshots taken from a superposition of the base flow with the\nperturbation. The cases shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 5a correspond to the same branch of the neutral stability curve of Fig. 4c and, as was\nexplained above, resemble the \"cold thermals\" instability observed in the experiments of Munakata & Tanasawa (1990) and of Teitel\net al. (2008). The results of Table 2 do not reveal any significant dependence of the base azimuthal velocity or its perturbation on this\ninstability. The observed instability mode becomes dominant as a result of alteration of the base meridional flow by rotation and we\nattribute it to the option (ii). This conclusion is supported also by results of Teitel et al. (2008) where this instability mode was\nobserved in the Czochralski model in the absence of any base rotation both experimentally and numerically. The azimuthal velocity\nperturbation in this case (Fig. 10f) seems to be rather a consequence than a reason for the instability onset.\n\n4.2 Destabilization versus continuous variation of the Prandtl number\nTo illustrate how the described above destabilization takes place at different Prandtl numbers, we present neutral stability curves\nfor three fixed values of the Reynolds number Re=0, 200 and 400, and the Prandtl number continuously varying from 0 to 10 (Fig.\n14). Due to difference in the critical values and in the qualitative behavior of the curves, the graphs in Fig. 14 are divided into two\nframes for Pr\u22641 and for Pr \u22651. We observe that the destabilization at small Prandtl numbers takes place starting from a certain, not\nvery large, value of the Reynolds number (Re=400), while at smaller values (Re=200) the critical azimuthal modes replace each other\nat approximately the same values of the critical Grashof number. According to arguments given in the previous Section, the\n24\n\n\fdestabilization at small Prandtl numbers is caused by mainly hydrodynamic mechanisms, such as interaction of counter rotating\nvortices and advection of angular momentum. To destabilize the base flow, these mechanisms must become strong enough, which\nhappens at a sufficiently large value of the Reynolds number. An indication of the absence of the described destabilization effect is the\nappearance of the spoke pattern at non-zero Re. In Fig. 14a it is observed at Re=200 for mcr=5 and 6.\nAs discussed above, at Pr \u22651 the destabilization takes place mainly due to the change of the temperature distribution. This may\nhappen at significantly smaller Reynolds numbers. In fact, for each Pr there exists a relatively low value of Reynolds number at which\nthe effect is strongest, e.g. at Re\u224850 in Fig. 4c. We observe also that for large Prandtl numbers the destabilization at Re=200 is\nstronger than that at Re=400. Note also that in the absence of rotation the instability results in a spoke pattern. The critical Grashof\nnumbers at Re=0 are very close for 10\u2264m\u226415 (Fig. 14b). As discussed above, at a relatively weak rotation the modes related to\noscillating jet or cold plumes instability become most unstable and replace the spoke pattern mode, thus leading to destabilization. The\noscillating jet and cold plumes modes are characterized by a smaller azimuthal wavenumber, which is seen on the curves\ncorresponding to Re=200 and 400 in Fig. 14b.\n\n4.3 Destabilization of convection under rotating magnetic field effect\nConsider now destabilization of a convective flow by the rotating magnetic field (Fig. 2c). Without the RMF effect the flow\nbecomes unstable at Grcr\u2248105. The corresponding flow and perturbation patterns are shown in Fig. 15. At Ta\u22481600, which\ncorresponds to a rather weak RMF effect (Grants & Gerbeth, 2002), the neutral curve branch started at Ta=0 is replaced by another\n25\n\n\fone steeply descending and reaching the minimal critical value of the Grashof number approximately 1.5\u00d7104 at Ta\u22481300 (Fig. 2c).\nAlong this neutral branch, the instability sets in due to increase of Ta rather than due to a change of Gr. Flow and perturbation patterns\ncorresponding to this instability mode are shown in Fig. 16. The first observation is that the meridional flow is almost unaltered by\nRMF (Fig. 16a and 16b), which indicates again on the RMF weakness. Contrarily, isolines of the azimuthal velocity are significantly\ndifferent when affected or not affected by the convective circulation (Fig. 16c). Gradually increasing the Grashof number from Gr=0\nto 2\u00d7104 we observe that the maximum of V first shifts upwards, then toward the axis, and then descends downwards, so that the\nisolines become almost symmetric, with respect to the z=1 plane, at Gr=2\u00d7104. Since the non-zero azimuthal velocity is the only\nsignificant difference from the Ta=0 case, we assume that this is also the main reason for destabilization. In fact, by switching of one\nor\nim\n\nseveral\n\ufffdV\nu\nr\n\ner , 2\n\nv\ufffdV\nr\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nterms\n\ner , and imVw\n\ufffdez , belonging to the meridional part of the linearized momentum equation, we observe a considerable\n\nstabilization of the flow. At the same time switching of the V-depending terms in the azimuthal component leads only to minor\n\nchanges of the critical parameters. The examination of eigenmodes at Ta=0 shows that there is no disturbance similar to that shown\nin Fig. 16d-16g when the RMF is absent. This makes this instability belonging to the option (iii).\nThe observed instability cannot be related to the Taylor-Couette mechanism because the meridional velocity perturbations are\nlarge closer to the axis (Fig. 16d and 16c), where azimuthal velocity decreases with the decrease of the radius, thus making the local\nrotation in this region stable. We conclude that the instability sets in due to advection of base rotation by meridional velocity\ndisturbances, and propose the following description. An appearance of a negative disturbance of the radial velocity at a point where its\n26\n\n\famplitude attains the maximum can bring a particle with a larger rotational moment towards the axis, where the rotation will increase.\nThis will increase the centrifugal force and, consequently, a positive perturbation of the radial velocity. The latter will happen during\nadvection of the particle downwards by the main vortex, and will happen already at another azimuthal angle. An increased centrifugal\nforce will increase the positive radial velocity in the lower part of the cylinder, which speeds up the main convective vortex. The\nperturbed vortex will create a negative perturbation of the radial velocity in the upper part of the flow and, therefore, there will be the\nfeedback mechanism leading to the meridional flow oscillations.\n\n4.4 Destabilization by rotation in Czochralski model flow\nNow we return to the Czochralski model flow that motivated this study. The full formulation of the problem can be found in\nCrnogorac et al. (2008) and Gelfgat (2008). The crucible radius is chosen as the characteristic length, and therefore definitions of the\nGrashof and Reynolds number remain unchanged. The flow is described by the Boussinesq equations (1)-(3) with no-slip boundary\nconditions at the bottom and the sidewall of the crucible, while the temperature there is prescribed according to the experiment of\nSchwabe et al. (2004)\nat r = 1:\n\nat z = 0:\n\nvr = v\u03b8 = vz = 0,\nvr = vz = v\u03b8 = 0,\n\n27\n\nT=1\n\nT = 0.8571 + 0.1429r 2\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n\fThe central part of the upper surface touches the rotating cold crystal dummy kept at the lower temperature. The remaining part of\nthe upper surface is cooled by a convective flow of air above it and is subject to the thermocapillary force. This reads\nR\n\ncrystal\nat z = A and r \u2264 Rcrucible\n:\n\nR\n\ncrystal\nat z = A and r > Rcrucible\n:\n\nvz = 0,\n\nvr = vz = 0, v\u03b8 = Recrystal r\n\u2202vr\n\u2202z\n\n\u2202T\n\n= \u2212MaPr \u2202r ,\n\n\u2202v\u03b8\n\u2202z\n\n(13)\n\u2202T\n\n= \u2212MaPr r\u2202\u03b8\n\n(14)\n\nThe flow is driven by buoyancy, thermocapillarity and rotation, which are characterized by the Grashof, Marangoni and Reynolds\nnumbers. The Marangoni number is defined as Ma = \u03b3\u2206TR\u2044\u03bd\u03b1 , where \u03b3 = |d\u03c3\u2044dt| is assumed to be a constant and \u03c3 is the surface\n\ntension coefficient. The working liquid is NaNO3 with Pr=9.2. Since both the Grashof and Marangoni numbers depend on the\ncharacteristic temperature difference we calculate Ma=586 \u2206T /Pr and Gr=1.9\u00d7105\u2206T and use \u2206T as a critical parameter.\nFigure 17 shows changes of the flow and perturbation patterns along the neutral stability curve of Fig. 1a. Since the instability in\nthis case is axisymmetric (mcr=0), we plot the stream function and its perturbation instead of the two meridional velocity components.\nAs above, in the case of our characteristic problem at Pr=7, we observe that with the increase of rotation the main convective\ncirculation weakens, which leads to a steepening of the axial unstable temperature gradient near the axis. This leads to strong\ntemperature perturbations that develop below the cold crystals and descend with the flow along the axis. The snapshots of isotherms\nshown in Figs. 18 and 19 for the points a and c of Fig. 1a, respectively, show similar oscillations of cold thermals that descend along\nthe axis. Examination of the case of Teitel et al. (2008) shown in Fig. 1b shows similar perturbation patterns and similar timedependence. We conclude that the destabilization observed for the large Prandtl number Czochralski melt flow has the same nature as\nthe one observed for the simplified characteristic problem. Rotation of the crystal causes a retardation of the main convective\n28\n\n\fcirculation, which leads to a formation of an unstably stratified layer beyond the crystal. This layer is destabilized by the RayleighB\u00e9nard mechanism, which is mainly defined by the layer thickness. With the increase of the rotation rate (the Reynolds number)\nformation of the unstable layer takes place at a lower Grashof number, thus resulting in the destabilization of this convective flow by\nrotation.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\nWe have studied the destabilization of buoyancy convection flows by a weak rotation, which was observed in the Czochralski\n\nmodel flows experimentally and numerically and motivated this study. Seeking for a simplified problem that reveals similar\ndestabilization we showed that thermal boundary conditions leading to the ascending of hot fluid along the lateral boundary and\ndescending of the cold fluid along the axis together with the rotating upper boundary, represent the needed characteristic problem.\nTherefore, a combination of previously studied problems of convection in a cylinder with parabolic sidewall temperature profile and\nswirling flow in a cylinder with a rotating lid was taken as a characteristic problem for further consideration. Several characteristic\ncases of destabilization were studied by observation of their flow and leading disturbance patterns, and by switching off some of the\nterms of the linearized stability equations (Table 2). The main conclusions are summarized in Table 3.\n\nTo show that the\n\ndestabilization of convection by a weak non-uniform rotation can extend also to other flow configurations we supplied an example of\nconvective flow interacting with RMF driven rotation.\nBased on all above observations we can expect the destabilization effect when buoyancy and centrifugal forces tend to create\nmeridional vortices of opposite direction. This leads to two rather obvious effects. The first one is a splitting of main convective\n29\n\n\fcirculation into several vortices with an unstable boundary between them that causes instability. The second effect is retardation of\nconvective mixing and creation of unstably stratified regions where Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard instability mechanism sets in. The third effect\nobserved is connected with the advection of the angular momentum and its perturbation towards the axis, which leads to growth of the\nazimuthal velocity with a consequent local growth of the centrifugal force. The latter increases the base radial velocity and its\nperturbation, thus intensifying advection and creating a positive feedback. This effect is found to be dominant, e.g., in the case of\nRMF destabilization of convection. In some other cases it was observed as an additional destabilization that enhances the two previous\neffects.\nIt should be mentioned also that starting the discussion on the mechanisms that lead to the convective flow destabilization by\nrotation we defined three main cases, which are (i) alteration of a leading disturbance by rotation making it unstable, (ii) alteration of\nthe base meridional flow pattern that leads to a destabilization of one of the leading eigenmodes, and (iii) an appearance of a new\neigenmode caused by the base rotational motion. Surprisingly, we observed cases (ii) and (iii) existing separately, as well as\ninteracting. However, we did not observe case (i).\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was supported by the German-Israeli Foundation, grant No. I-954 -34.10/2007.\n\n30\n\n\fReferences\nAkamatsu, M., Kakimoto, K., and Ozoe, H. 1997 Numerical computation for the secondary convection in a Czochralski crystal\ngrowing system with a rotating crucible and static crystal rod.
