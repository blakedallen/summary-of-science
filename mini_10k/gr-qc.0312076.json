It is natural to ask if the inflationary universe\ncan be possible or not in this context. Let us recall the well known formula for\nthe cosmological constant in the braneworld:\n\u039beff =\n\n3\n\u03ba4 \u03c3 2\n\u2212 2 ,\n12\nl\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3 and l are the tension of the brane and the curvature scale in the bulk\nwhich is determined by the bulk vacuum energy, respectively. For \u03ba2 \u03c3 = 6/l, we\nhave Minkowsky spacetime. In order to obtain the inflationary universe, we need\nthe positive effective cosmological constant. In the brane world model, there are\ntwo possibilities. One is to increase the brane tension and the other is to increase\nl. The brane tension can be controlled by the scalar field on the brane. The bulk\ncurvature scale l can be controlled by the bulk scalar field. The former case is a\nnatural extension of the 4-dimensional inflationary scenario. The latter possibility\nis a novel one peculiar to the brane model. Recall that, in the superstring theory,\nscalar fields are ubiquitous. Indeed, the dilaton and moduli exists in the bulk\nc 2004 by Universal Academy Press, Inc.\n\n\f2\n\ngenerically, because they arise as the modes associated with the closed string.\nMoreover, when the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, they may have the\nnon-trivial potential. Hence, it is natural to consider the inflationary scenario\ndriven by these fields [2]. In this paper, we would like to present a formalism\nto discuss the inflationary scenario in the braneworld context. We also show the\nbulk inflaton can, in fact, drive the inflation on the brane.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In sec.2, we describe the model.\nIn sec.3, we obtain the effective action using the low energy approximation and\ndiscuss its implication. In sec. 4, the action with KK effects are presented. In\nthe final section, we summarize our results.\n2.\n\nModel and Basic Equations\n\nWe consider a S1 /Z2 orbifold spacetime with the two branes as the fixed\npoints. In this first Randall-Sundrum (RS1) model, the two flat 3-branes are\n\u2295\n\u2296\nembedded in AdS5 and the brane tensions given by \u03c3 = 6/(\u03ba2 l) and \u03c3 = \u22126/(\u03ba2 l).\nOur system is described by the action\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n1 AB\n1\n5 \u221a\n5 \u221a\nd x \u2212g R \u2212 d x \u2212g\ng \u2202A \u03c6\u2202B \u03c6 + U(\u03c6)\nS =\n2\u03ba2\n2\nZ\nZ\nX\nX i\np\np\nd4 x \u2212g i-brane Limatter ,\n(2)\n\u03c3 d4 x \u2212g i-brane +\n\u2212\ni=\u2295,\u2296\ni\n\ni=\u2295,\u2296\n\ni-brane\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd\nand \u03c3 are the induced metric and the brane tension on the i-brane,\nrespectively. We assume the potential U(\u03c6) for the bulk scalar field takes the\nform U(\u03c6) = \u2212 \u03ba26l2 + V (\u03c6) , where the first term is regarded as a 5-dimensional\ncosmological constant and the second term is an arbitrary potential function. The\nbrane tension \u03c3 is tuned so that the effective cosmological constant on the brane\nvanishes. The above setup realizes a flat braneworld after inflation ends and the\nfield \u03c6 reaches the minimum of its potential.\nInflation in the braneworld can be driven by a scalar field either on the\nbrane or in the bulk. We derive the effective equations of motion which are useful\nfor both models. In this section, we begin with the single-brane system. Since\nwe know the effective 4-dimensional equations hold irrespective of the existence\nof other branes [3], the analysis of the single-brane system is sufficient to derive\nthe effective action for the two-brane system as we see in the next section.\nWe adopt the Gaussian normal coordinate system to describe the geometry\nof the brane model; ds2 = dy 2 + g\u03bc\u03bd (y, x\u03bc )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd , where the brane is assumed to\nbe located at y = 0. Let us decompose the extrinsic curvature into the traceless\npart \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd and the trace part K as K\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 21 g\u03bc\u03bd,y = \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd + 14 g\u03bc\u03bd K . Then, we\n\n\f3\n\ncan obtain the basic equations off the brane using these variables. First, the\nHamiltonian constraint equation leads to\n(4)\n3 2\nK \u2212 \u03a3\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03a3\u03b2 \u03b1 = R \u2212 \u03ba2 \u2207\u03b1 \u03c6\u2207\u03b1 \u03c6 + \u03ba2 (\u2202y \u03c6)2 \u2212 2\u03ba2 U(\u03c6) ,\n4\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere R is the curvature on the brane and \u2207\u03bc denotes the covariant derivative\nwith respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd . Momentum constraint equation becomes\n3\n\u2207\u03bb \u03a3\u03bc \u03bb \u2212 \u2207\u03bc K = \u2212\u03ba2 \u2202y \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 .\n4\nEvolution equation in the direction of y is given by\n\u0014(4)\n\u0015\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n2 \u03bc\n\u03a3 \u03bd,y \u2212 K\u03a3 \u03bd = \u2212 R \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03ba \u2207 \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6\n\n(4)\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\ntraceless\n\nFinally, the equation of motion for the scalar field reads\n\u2202y2 \u03c6 \u2212 K\u2202y \u03c6 + \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 \u03c6 \u2212 U \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the prime denotes derivative with respect to the scalar field \u03c6.\nAs we have the singular source at the brane position, we must consider\nthe junction conditions. Assuming a Z2 symmetry of spacetime, we obtain the\njunction conditions for the metric and the scalar field\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba2\n3 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n= \u2212 \u03c3\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc + T \u03bc \u03bd ,\n(7)\n\u03a3 \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n4\n2\n2\ny=0\nh\ni\n= 0,\n(8)\n\u2202y \u03c6\ny=0\n\nwhere T\n3.\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nis the energy-momentum tensor for the matter fields on the brane.\n\nLow Energy Effective Action\n\nWe assume the inflation occurs at low energy in the sense that the additional energy due to the bulk scalar field is small, \u03ba2 l2 V (\u03c6) \u226a 1, and the\ncurvature on the brane R is also small, Rl2 \u226a 1. It should be stressed that\nthe low energy does not necessarily implies weak gravity on the brane. Under\nthese circumstances, we can use a gradient expansion scheme to solve the bulk\nequations of motion.\nAt zeroth order, we ignore matters on the brane. Then, from the junction\ncondition (7), we have\n\u0015\n\u0014(0)\n\u03ba2\n3 \u03bc (0)\n\u03bc\n= \u2212 \u03c3\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc .\n(9)\n\u03a3 \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n4\n2\ny=0\n\n\f4\n(0)\n\nAs the right hand side of (9) contains no traceless part, we get \u03a3 \u03bc \u03bd = 0 . We also\ntake the potential for the bulk scalar field U(\u03c6) to be \u22126/(\u03ba2 l2 ). We discard the\nterms with 4-dimensional derivatives since one can neglect the long wavelength\nvariation in the direction of x\u03bc at low energies. Thus, the equations to be solved\nare given by\n(0)\n12\n3 (0)2\nK = \u03ba2 (\u2202y \u03c6 )2 + 2 ,\n4\nl\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(10)\n\n(0)\n\n\u2202y2 \u03c6 \u2212 K\u2202y \u03c6 = 0 .\nh (0)i\nThe junction condition (8) at this order \u2202y \u03c6\n\n(11)\n= 0 tells us that the solution of\n\ny=0\n\n(0)\n\nEq.(11) must be \u03c6 = \u03b7 (x\u03bc ) , where \u03b7(x\u03bc ) is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n(0)\n\nNow, the solution of Eq.(11) yields K = 4/l . Other Eqs. (4) and (5) are trivially\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nsatisfied at zeroth order. Using the definition K \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd,y /2, we have the\nlowest order metric\n(0)\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd (y, x\u03bc ) = b2 (y) h\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ),\n\nb(y) \u2261 e\u2212y/l ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the induced metric on the brane, h\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x\u03bc ), arises as a constant\nof integration. The junction condition for the induced metric (9) merely implies\nwell known relation \u03ba2 \u03c3 = 6/l and that for the scalar field (8) is trivially satisfied.\nAt this leading order analysis, we can not determine the constants of integration\nh\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ) and \u03b7(x\u03bc ) which are constant as far as the short length scale l variations\nare concerned, but are allowed to vary over the long wavelength scale. These\nconstants should be constrained by the next order analysis.\nNow, we take into account the effect of both the bulk scalar field and the\nmatter on the brane perturbatively. Our iteration scheme is to write the metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd and the scalar field \u03c6 as a sum of local tensors built out of the induced metric\nand the induced scalar field on the brane, in the order of expansion parameters,\nthat is, O((Rl2)n ) and O(\u03ba2 l2 V (\u03c6))n , n = 0, 1, 2, * * * [3]. Then, we expand the\nmetric and the scalar field as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1)\n(2)\n\u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ng\u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) = b (y) h\u03bc\u03bd (x ) + g \u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) + g \u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) + * * * ,\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c6(y, x\u03bc ) = \u03b7(x\u03bc ) + \u03c6 (y, x\u03bc ) + \u03c6 (y, x\u03bc ) + * * * .\n(i)\n\n(13)\n(i)\n\nHere, we put the boundary conditions g \u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x\u03bc ) = 0 , \u03c6(y = 0, x\u03bc ) =\n0 , i = 1, 2, 3, ... so that we can interpret h\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b7 as induced quantities.\n\n\f5\n\nExtrinsic curvatures can be also expanded as\nK=\n\n4 (1) (2)\n+K +K +*** ,\nl\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03a3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd + \u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd + * * * .\n\n(14)\n\n(4) (0)\n\nUsing the formula such as R( g \u03bc\u03bd ) = R(h\u03bc\u03bd )/b2 , we obtain the solution\n(1)\n\n\u0001 l 2\nl\n2 |\u03b1\nR(h)\n\u2212\n\u03ba\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n(15)\n\u2212 \u03ba V (\u03b7) ,\n|\u03b1\n6b2\n3\nwhere R(h) is the scalar curvature of h\u03bc\u03bd and | denotes the covariant derivative\nwith respect to h\u03bc\u03bd .

Hereafter, we omit the argument of the\ncurvature for simplicity. Integrating the scalar field equation (6) at first order, we\nhave\n(1)\nl\nC\nl\n\u2737\u03b7 \u2212 V \u2032 (\u03b7) + 4 ,\n(17)\n\u2202y \u03c6 =\n2\n2b\n4\nb\nwhere C is also a constant of integration. At first order in this iteration scheme,\nwe get two kinds of constants of integration, \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd and C.\nGiven the matter fields T\u03bc\u03bd on the brane, the junction condition (7) becomes\n\u0014(1)\n\u0015\n3 \u03bc (1)\n\u03ba2\n\u03bc\n\u03a3 \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n= T \u03bc\u03bd .\n(18)\n4\n2\nK=\n\ny=0\n\nAt this order, the junction condition (8) yields\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1)\n\u2202y \u03c6\n=0.\n\n(19)\n\ny=0\n\nThese junction conditions give the effective equations of motion on the brane.\nThe point is the fact that the equations of motion on each brane take the\nsame form if we use the induced metric on each brane [5].

When we set the position of the\npositive tension brane at y = 0, that of the negative tension brane \u0233 in general\ndepends on x\u03bc , i.e. \u0233 = \u0233(x\u03bc ). Hence, the warp factor at the negative tension\nbrane \u03a9(x\u03bc ) \u2261 b(\u0233(x)) also depends on x\u03bc . Because the metric always comes\ninto equations with derivatives, the zeroth order relation is enough in this first\norder discussion. Hence, the metric on the positive tension brane is related to the\nmetric on the negative tension brane as f\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 h\u03bc\u03bd .\nAlthough Eqs.

We can therefore easily eliminate \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd from Eqs. (20) and (21), since \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd\nappears only algebraically. Eliminating \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd from both Eqs.

(22) and (24) are derived from a scalar-tensor type theory coupled\nto the additional scalar field.\nSimilarly, the equations for the scalar field on branes become\nV\u2032 2\n+ C=0,\n2\nl\nV\u2032 2 C\n+\n=0,\n\u2737f \u03b7 \u2212\n2\nl \u03a94\n\n\u2737h \u03b7 \u2212\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\n\f7\n\nwhere the subscripts refer to the induced metric on each brane. Notice that the\nscalar field takes the same value for both branes at this order. Eliminating the\ndark source C from these Eqs. (25) and (26), we find the equation for the scalar\nfield takes the form\n\u2032\n\u2737h \u03b7 \u2212 Veff\n=\u2212\n\n\u03a8|\u03bc\n\u03b7|\u03bc .\n\u03a8\n\n(27)\n\nNotice that the radion acts as a source for \u03b7. And we can also get the dark source\nas\nV\u2032\n\u03a8|\u03bc\n2\nC = \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03a8) +\n\u03b7|\u03bc .\nl\n2\n\u03a8\n\n(28)\n\nNow the effective action for the positive tension brane which gives Eqs. (22),\n(24) and (27) can be read off as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n\u0001\nl\n3\n4\n|\u03b1\n2\n|\u03b1\nS =\nd x \u2212h \u03a8R \u2212\n\u03a8 \u03a8|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03ba \u03a8 \u03b7 \u03b7|\u03b1 + 2Veff\n2\u03ba2\n2(1 \u2212 \u03a8)\nZ\nZ\n\u2295\n\u2296\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4\n(29)\n+ d x \u2212h L + d4 x \u2212h (1 \u2212 \u03a8)2 L ,\nwhere the last two terms represent actions for the matter on each brane. Thus,\nwe found the radion field couples with the induced metric and the induced scalar\nfield on the brane non-trivially. Surprisingly, at this order, the nonlocality of \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd\nand C are eliminated by the radion.\nAs this is a closed system, we can analyze a primordial spectrum to predict\nthe cosmic background fluctuation spectrum [4]. Interestingly, \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd and C vanishes\nin the single brane limit, \u03a8 \u2192 1, as can be seen from (23) and (28). The dynamics\nis simply governed by Einstein theory with the single scalar field. Therefore,\nwe can conclude that the bulk inflaton can drive inflation when the slow role\nconditions are satisfied.\n4.\n\nKK corrections\n\nIt would be important to take into account the KK effects as corrections\nto the leading order result. Using our approach, in the single brane limit, we\ncan deduce the effective action with KK corrections as [5] ( see also [6] for recent\ndevelopments)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\nZ\n\u221a\nl2 2\nl2 \u2032\u2032 |\u03b1\nl2 2\nl\n4\n2\n\u03b7 \u03b7|\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03ba2 Veff\nd x \u2212h 1 + \u03ba V R \u2212 \u03ba 1 + \u03ba V \u2212 V\nS =\n2\u03ba2\n12\n12\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015 Z\n\u221a\nl2\n1 2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212\nR R\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 R\n+ d4 x \u2212h Lmatter + SCFT , (30)\n4\n3\n\n\f8\n\nwhere the effective potential at this order is defined by\nl2 \u03ba2 2 l2 \u20322\n1\nV \u2212 V .\nVeff = V +\n2\n48\n64\n\n(31)\n\nand the last term comes from the energy-momentum tensor of CFT matter \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd .\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe derived the non-linear low energy effective action for the dilatonic\nbraneworld. We considered the bulk scalar field with a nontrivial potential. Then,\nthe constant of integration is determined completely. As a result, the effective\ntheory reduces to the scalar-tensor theory with the non-trivial coupling between\nthe radion and the bulk scalar field. It turns out that \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd and C becomes zero\nwhen two branes get separated infinitely. This implies that the bulk inflaton can\ndrive the inflation on the brane as far as the slow role conditions are satisfied. We\nalso obtained KK corrections in the single brane limit.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Fund of\nthe Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan No. 155476 (SK) and\nNo.14540258 (JS).\nReferences\n[1] L.
