Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n69 (2000) 2387], we propose the dynamics of sweeping interface, in which material distributed\nover a region is swept by a moving interface. A model based on a phase field is constructed\nand results of numerical simulations are presented for one and two dimensions. Relevance of\nthe present model to the drying experiment is discussed.\nKEYWORDS: interface dynamics, sweeping interface, pattern formation, phase field model, granular system\n\nYamazaki and Mizuguchi1 have shown that fascinating labyrinthine patterns are formed simply by drying\nthe mixture of water and corn starch powder that is\nconfined in the two-dimensional space between two glass\nplates; During the drying process, the powder is trapped\nat the interface due to the surface tension and swept\naway, but the interface becomes corrugated and leaves\nintricate patterns of powder behind.\nThis process poses a new type of interface dynamics,\nwhich we call the sweeping interface dynamics; As the\ninterface passes over the space where some material, e.g.\nthe powder in the above experiment, is distributed, it\nsweeps and collects the material along itself. If the accumulated material resists to move due to friction or some\nother mechanism, the part of the interface where the material density is larger than at neighboring parts falls behind, then more material will be swept into the region\nfrom the neighbor. This process causes the instability of\nthe flat interface.\nIn this report, in order to study the dynamics of sweeping interface, we construct a model based on a phase field\nand examine its behavior by numerical simulations.\nThe model consists of two field variables, the phase\nfield u and the material density v, in the two dimensional\nspace. The interface dynamics is simulated by the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for the phase field\nu(x, y, t),\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202u\n1\n2 2\n\u03c4\n= l \u2207 u + u(1 \u2212 u) u \u2212 \u2212 b ,\n(1)\n\u2202t\n2\nwith a constant b; \u03c4 and l are the time and the length\nscales, respectively, that characterize the interface. Its\nRHS may be derived from the free energy potential. We\nassume 0 < b < 1/2, then the system has the stable phase\nwith u = 0 and the meta stable phase with u = 1, which\nwe assign for the dry and the wet phase, respectively, in\nthe present context. It is easy to see that eq.(1) has the\nsolution\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u0015\n\u221a l\n1\n1\n1 + tanh \u221a\nx \u2212 2b t\n, (2)\nu(x, y, t) =\n2\n\u03c4\n8l\nwhich represents the flat interface between the two\nphases and it is advancing to expand the stable dry phase\n\nwith the speed proportional to b.\nAs for the material density field v(x, y, t), the total\namount of material should be conserved, therefore, the\ndensity field follows the equation of continuity\n\u2202v\n= \u2212\u2207 * J\n(3)\n\u2202t\nwith J being the flux of material flow.\nSweeping by the interface is represented by the material flux given by\nJ = (A(v)\u2207u) v \u2212 D(u)\u2207v.\n\n(4)\n\nThe first term of RHS represents the flux driven by the\ninterface and the second term is the diffusion flux. In the\nfirst term, the factor (A(v)\u2207u) can be regarded as the\nflowing speed of the material driven by the interface, then\nthe factor \u2207u represents the driving intensity and A(v) is\nthe factor proportional to the mobility of the matter. The\nmobility A(v) should be a decreasing function because,\nin the region with higher density, the material is difficult\nto flow due to the friction effect. We also introduce the\ndiffusion only within the interface region by assuming\nD(u) = D0 u(1 \u2212 u)\n\n(5)\n\nwith a constant D0 . This diffusion flux is originally introduced to eliminate a small scale instability, which appears in numerical simulations without the diffusion, but\nit is plausible that some diffusion process always exists\nin a real system.\nAs a reaction to the driving force on the material, the\ninterface slows down in the large v region. This may be\nrepresented by making a constant b in eq.(1) a decreasing\nfunction of v.\nThe central part of the present model to embody the\nsweeping dynamics is in the interaction between the interface in the phase field and the material density given\nby the first term of J in eq.(4) and b(v) in eq.(1), but\ntheir detailed forms are rather arbitrary. The important\npoints for the sweeping dynamics of propagating interface are (i) the interface drives the material flux that is\nnormal to the interface, (ii) the friction of material resists\nthe drive (iii) the reaction of the drive from the material\nslows down the interface propagation upon increasing the\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nmaterial density.\nWe employ simple forms for b(v) and A(v),\nb(v) =\n\nb0\n,\nv/vb + 1\n\nA(v) =\n\nA0\n,\nv/vA + 1\n\n(6)\n\nwith constants b0 , A0 , vb , and vA .\nThe initial material distribution is assumed to be uniform with a constant density v0 , namely, v(x, y, t = 0) =\nv0 , and the simulations start with a phase field\n\u0012\n\u0013i\n1h\n1\nu(x, y, t = 0) = 1 + tanh\n(x \u2212 xi (y))\n(7)\n2\nl\nwith an initial interface position xi (y). Numerical integration is performed with the spatial step \u2206x = \u2206y =\n0.5 and the time step \u2206t = 0.03, using the central differences for the spatial derivatives, and Euler method\nfor the time derivative in the phase field equation (1)\nand CIP (Cubic Interpolated Profile) method2, 3 for the\nequation of continuity (3). The following simulations are\nlimited to the case of vA = vb , and we employ the unit\nsystem where vb , \u03c4 , and l are unities. Most of simulations are done with the parameters A0 = 8, b0 = 0.4,\nand D0 = 1 with v0 = 0.5, unless stated otherwise.\nFirst, we examine the one-dimensional solution, which\nmight be considered to be the solution uniform in the y\ndirection in two dimensions; The initial u is the flat interface with constant xi in eq.(7). Fig.1(a) shows the time\ndevelopment of the system in one dimension; Initially, the\nmaterial piles up around the interface and the peak of v\nincreases as the interface advances, but eventually the\npeak in v becomes stationary when the interface passes\naround x \u2248 300 because the material starts overflowing\nbehind the sweeping interface. The speed of the interface\nslows down due to the friction as the material is accumulated, but the system reaches the steady state, where the\nprofile of v is stationary in time. The stationary profiles\nare shown for a few sets of A0 and b0 in Fig.1(b); One\ncan see the peak of v is large for large A0 or for small b0 .\nIn the steady propagation, the material density behind\n\n(a)\nu\n\n20\n\nv\n\n0\n20\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n0\n\nthe interface is same with the density ahead of it even\nthough the flux is not zero within the interface; All the\nmaterial is simply displaced by a certain distance.\nThe behavior without the diffusion flux in one dimension is shown in Fig.2, where the profiles of u and v are\nplotted in the case of D0 = 0. Without the diffusion, one\ncan see that v develops a discontinuity in the rear side of\nthe interface down to the finest spatial step introduced in\nnumerics. We have tried a few functional forms for A(v)\nand b(v), and parameter values, but in all the cases, v\neventually develops similar discontinuity when we uses a\nparameter set that yields substantial accumulation.\nThis instability is similar to the one in Burgers equation in the inviscid limit; In the rear side of the interface,\nthe density v is smaller than that in the preceding part.\nIn the small v region, the material flowing speed is large\nbecause A(v) is large for small v, therefore, v in the rear\nside is pushed forward to make a steep cliff.\nNow, we study the two-dimension system. In two dimensions, the propagation of a long straight sweeping interface is unstable; If a disturbance makes accumulated\nmaterial density at a certain part along the interface\nlarger than that at neighbors, then the advancing speed\nof the interface becomes slower there, thus the interface\nbecomes concave. This makes the density v increase further because the material is swept into the concave part,\nfrom which the material overflows behind the interface.\nThis mechanism destabilizes a straight interface to make\na corrugated one, which leaves some pattern in the material density after it passes.\nThe two-dimensional simulations are done in the system size of Lx \u00d7 Ly . We employ the periodic boundary\ncondition in the y direction, but the boundaries are open\nin the x direction.\nFig.3 shows the time development of the rectangular\nsystem with Lx \u00d7Ly = 250\u00d725 from the initial phase field\nwith a sinusoidally perturbed interface with the period\nLy ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\ny ,\n(8)\nxi (y) \u2261 x0 + R cos\nLy\nwhere x0 is the initial position and R is the amplitude of\nthe perturbation; We take x0 = 35 and R = 5 with the\norigin at the lower left corner.

One can see from the figure that the curved\ninterface propagates steadily with the stationary form\nand it leaves a streak of the material accumulated behind\nthe region where the interface falls behind. It should be\nnoted that the interface in u is fairly flat and does not\nstay with the line structure of v.\nFig.4 shows snapshots at t = 1800 for the systems with\nLx = 600 and various width Ly ; The initial interface is\ngiven by eqs.(7) and (8) with a one period for each Ly . It\nshows that the curved interface becomes flat for Ly = 15,\nand the single peak interface is unstable against forming\nanother peak for Ly >\n\u223c 40. The results suggest that there\nis an optimal spacing for peaks in the interface. In the\ncase of the system with Ly = 40, the single peak interface\nis unstable, and another peak tries to emerge, but cannot\nmake it; The interface shows a periodic behavior.\nFig.5 shows the steady propagation speed of the interface for various system with Ly . When a curved interface\npropagates steadily, it is much faster than the flat interface. In the curved interface, the \"lighter\" part with less\naccumulation travels ahead and pull up the \"heavier\"\npart, from which the material drains behind more efficiently than in the case of the flat interface. The speed\nis slower for a wider system as long as the interface is\nsingle peaked because more material is accumulated into\nthe concave part of the interface. For even wider systems\n(Ly >\n\u223c 40), another peak appears spontaneously, and the\ninterface speed becomes the same with the system of half\nwidth with the single peak interface.\nThe steady form of interface changes not only with the\nsystem width Ly but also with the material density v0 .\nFig.6 shows the stability diagram of the curved interface\nwith sweeping pattern; It can be seen that the curved\ninterface becomes flat for the large wave number 1/Ly\n\n1.5\n\nflat\ninterface\n\n1\n\nv0\n\nFig. 4. The snapshots of v at t = 1800 for the system with Lx =\n600 and various width Ly =15, 25, 30, 40, and 50 from top to\nbottom. The system length is Lx = 600 and the other parameters\nare A0 = 8, b0 = 0.4, D0 = 1, and v0 = 0.5.\n\nand/or the large material density v0 .\nThis means that, for larger density of material v0 , minimum length scale of the pattern becomes larger in the\npresent model. This is caused by interplay between the\nfriction effect and the diffusion; For large v0 , the accumulation at the interface becomes large, which makes the\ninterface motion slow, then the distance that the material diffuses along the interface becomes large, and the\nlength scale of the pattern becomes long.\nFig.7 is a snapshot of the density field v that emerges\nfrom an initial sinusoidal interface with small irregularity. The interface is initially located near the left end of\nthe system, and at the time of the snapshot, it is located\naround the edge of the flat v region near the right end of\nthe system. One can see that a small perturbation produces a globally irregular pattern. If one compare it with\nthe patterns obtained by Yamazaki and Mizuguchi experiment,1 there are both similarity and difference; The\nsimilarity is that any part of the region where the material is swept away is connected to the outside because\nthe pattern is produced by sweeping interface. The difference is that the interface remains flat over the scale that\nspans several streaks, consequently, the pattern shows\nclear direction toward which the interface has moved, in\ncontrast with the isotropic pattern in the experiment,\nwhere the interface is virtually blocked by clogging powder and corrugated wildly. It seems necessary to include\nmore efficient mechanism in the model to stop the interface propagation than that by the term through the\nfunction b(v) in eqs. (1) and (6).\n\ncurved\ninterface\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n1/Ly\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nFig. 6. The stability diagram for the curved interface in the v0 \u2212\n1/Ly plane.

The gap, however, can be controlled by\ninserting spacers. It is interesting to find that the pattern\nproduced by the present model (Fig.7) rather resembles\nthose found in the experiments with the gap 50\u03bcm or\n100\u03bcm.4 This may be because the friction effect is smaller\nin the larger gap plates.\nAnother difference is that, in the experiment, the scale\nof pattern does not depend on the powder density, but\nin the present simulation, the length scale becomes large\nfor large v0 due to the diffusion, as we have seen already.\nThe diffusion plays a subtle role in the present model. It\nis introduced originally to suppress the small scale singularity similar to the one in inviscid Burgers equation,\n\nAuthor Name\n\nbut the diffusion turns out to determine the length scale\nof the pattern. In that respect, we have to examine, for\neach v0 , if there exists the small D0 parameter region\nwhere the small scale singularity is suppressed, yet the\nglobal pattern is not affected by the diffusion.\nIn comparison with the phase field model for the crystal growth,5 a major difference is the length scale over\nwhich the coupling field v changes. In the crystal growth\ndynamics, the coupling field is the temperature, and its\ncharacteristic length scale can be much larger than the\ninterface width of the phase field. Using this length scale\ndifference, the interface dynamics has been derived in\nthe narrow interface limit.6 On the other hand, in the\nsweeping interface dynamics, a steep change of the coupling field v seems to be intrinsic because the length scale\nof the variation in v in the normal direction is no longer\nthan the interface width of u even in the narrow interface\nlimit.\nIn summary, we propose a dynamics of sweeping interface and construct a model based on the phase field.\nNumerical simulations are performed to find that the flat\ninterface becomes unstable and some pattern is produced\nafter the interface passes.\nThe authors thank Dr. Yamazaki for showing unpublished experimental data, and Dr. Kobayashi for his comments on the phase field model.
