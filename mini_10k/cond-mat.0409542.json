Therefore, its proper understanding is essential. In the literature this is sometimes\nclouded by the frequent use of the thermodynamic limit\nand/or the use of the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical statistics. In what follows, I will try to define it with minimum\nbias.\nBoltzmann's epitaph reads\nS=k*lnW\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nW (E, N, V) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192 \u2192\nd3N p d3N q\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 H{ q , p }) (2)\nN !(2\u03c0~)3N\n\nin semi-classical approximation.

Or, more\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\npeople/gross/\n\ngross@hmi.de; URL: http://www.hmi.de/\n\nW (E, N, V) = T\nr[PE ]\n(3)\nX\nall eigenstates n of H with given N,V,\n=\nand E \u2212 \u01eb0 /2 < En \u2264 E + \u01eb0 /2\n\nand \u01eb0 \u2248 the macroscopic energy resolution. This is still\nup to day the deepest, most fundamental, and most simple definition of entropy. There is no need of the thermodynamic limit, no need of concavity, extensivity and\nhomogeneity. In its semi-classical approximation, eq.(2),\nW (E, N, V, * * * ) simply measures the area of the submanifold of points in the 6N -dimensional phase-space (\u0393space) with prescribed energy E, particle number N , volume V, and some other time invariant constraints which\nare here suppressed for simplicity. Because it was Planck\nwho coined it in this mathematical form, I will call it the\nBoltzmann-Planck principle.\nThere are various reviews on the mathematical foundation of Statistical Mechanics e.g. the detailed and instructive article by Alfred Wehrl [2]. He shows how the\nBoltzmann-Planck formula (1), with (3) can be generalized to the famous definition of entropy in Quantum\nMechanics by von Neumann[3]\nS = \u2212T r[\u03c1 ln(\u03c1)],\naddressing general (non projector like) densities \u03c1.\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\nWehrl discusses the conventional canonical BoltzmannGibbs statistics where all constraints are only fixed to\ntheir mean, allowing for free fluctuations. He points to\nthe many serious complications of this definition. However, in the case of conserved observables we know more\nthan their mean. We know these quantities sharply.\nIn Microcanonical Thermodynamics we don't need von\nNeumann's definition (4) and can work on the level of\nBoltzmann-Planck's original definition of S by eqs.(1 and\n3). We thus explore Statistical Mechanics and entropy on\nits most fundamental level. This has the great advantage\nthat the axiomatic level is extremely simple. Because it\ndoes not demand scaling or extensivity, it can further be\napplied to the much wider group of non-extensive systems\nfrom nuclei to galaxies [4] and address the original object\nof Thermodynamics for which it was invented some 150\nyears ago: phase separations.\nThe Boltzmann-Planck formula has a direct and simple\nbut deep physical interpretation: W or S are the measure of our ignorance about the complete set of initial\nvalues for all 6N microscopic degrees of freedom which\nare needed to specify the N -body system unambiguously\n[5]. Usually we only know the few time-independent control parameters E, N, V, * * * , of the system (conserved or\nvery slowly varying) but have no control of the other fast\nchanging degrees of freedom. If the information would be\ncomplete, i.e. all 6N -degrees of freedom sharply known\nat some time t0 , W would be a single cell of size (2\u03c0~)3N\nin the 6N -dim. phase space, and S would be 0.\nHowever, many initial values are consistent with the\nsame values of E, N, V, * * * , (redundancy of control parameters). All the other degrees of freedom vary with\ntime, usually fast, and are normally not under control.\nThe manifold of all these points in the 6N -dim. phase\nspace is the microcanonical ensemble. It has a well\ndefined geometrical size W and due to eq.(1) a nonvanishing entropy S(E, N, V, * * * ). The dependence of\nS(E, N, V, * * * ) on its arguments gives the complete thermostatics and equilibrium thermodynamics.\nIt is further clear that the Hamiltonian (Liouvillean)\ndynamics of the system cannot create the missing information about the initial values. I.e. the entropy\nS(E, N, V, * * * ) cannot decrease. As is further worked\nout in [6] and more recently in [4] the inherent finite resolution of the macroscopic description implies usually an\nincrease of W or S with time when a constraint is removed (Second Law of Thermodynamics).\nIt should be emphasized that this proper statistical definition of the entropy S(E, N, V, * * * ) characterizes the\nwhole microcanonical ensemble [5]. It measures the total\nnumber of the possible states of the system under the information given. Eqs. (2,3) are in clear contrast to the\n\ndefinition suggested by [7\u201310]:\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192 \u2192\nd3N p d3N q\nWbulk (E) =\n\u0398(E \u2212 H{ q , p }) (5)\nN !(2\u03c0~)3N\nX all eigenstates n of H with given N,V,\n=\n(6)\nand 0 \u2264 En \u2264 E\n\nZ\n\n= eSbulk (E,N,V)\n\n(7)\n\nOur statistical definition (2,3) called Ssurf in [10] has a\npriori not much to do with the adiabatic invariants of a\nsingle trajectory in the 6N -dim. phase space.\nAs we will see later in section (III) the entropy S(E)\nfor non-extensive systems can be convex in contrast to\nthe assumption made by Hertz [7]. Then the temperature or the mean kinetic energy per particle do not control the energy flow during the equilibration of two systems in thermal contact as was the crucial argument of\nHertz [7] to introduce Sbulk ,(5-7). In contrast, the Boltzmann entropy eq.(2) does still control the direction of the\nenergy-flow under equilibration even in these somewhat\nastonishing and unconventional though ubiquitous situations. This clearly underlines the role of the Boltzmann\nentropy (2) as the fundamental quantity and not the temperature for statistical mechanics. I am fully aware that\nthis contradicts opposite statements given by [7, 8, 10].\nMoreover, the definition of the bulk entropy\nSbulk (E, N, V) (5-7) contains also, energetically, inaccessible states with less energy, which are clearly excluded\nby our knowledge of the total energy. Thus, Sbulk does\nnot represent the redundancy, or ignorance, of the available information. Therefore it is not acceptable by conceptual reasons. This is a clear warning that one should\nnot follow some formal definitions and forget the original\nclear meaning of entropy and statistics as is often done\nin the literature. Of course, for macroscopic systems the\ndifference between the two alternative definitions of the\nentropy eqs.(2-3) and eqs.(5,7) disappears.\nII.\n\nTHE ZERO'TH LAW IN CONVENTIONAL\nEXTENSIVE THERMODYNAMICS\n\nIn conventional (extensive) thermodynamics thermal\nequilibrium of two systems (1 & 2) is established by\nbringing them into thermal contact which allows free energy exchange[27]. Equilibrium is established when the\ntotal entropy\nStotal (E, E1 ) = S1 (E1 ) + S2 (E \u2212 E1 )\n\n(8)\n\nis maximal:\ndStotal (E, E1 )|E = dS1 (E1 ) + dS2 (E \u2212 E1 ) = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nUnder an energy flux \u2206E2\u21921 from 2 \u2192 1 the total entropy changes to lowest order in \u2206E by\n\u2206Stotal |E = (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 )\u2206E2\u21921\n1\n\u03b2 = dS/dE =\nT\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\f3\nConsequently, a maximum of Stotal (E = E1 + E2 , E1 )|E\nwill be approached when\nsign(\u2206Stotal ) = sign(T2 \u2212 T1 )sign(\u2206E2\u21921 ) > 0\n\n(12)\n\nFrom here Clausius' first formulation of the Second Law\nfollows: \"Heat always flows from hot to cold\". Essential\nfor this conclusion is the additivity of S under the split\n(eq.8). There are no correlations, which are destroyed\nwhen an extensive system is split. Temperature is an\nappropriate control parameter for extensive systems.\nIII.\n\nNO PHASE SEPARATION WITHOUT A\nCONVEX, NON-EXTENSIVE S(E)\n\nSince the beginning of Thermodynamics in the middle\nof the 19.century its main motivation was the description\nof steam engines and the liquid to gas transition of water.\nHere water prefers to become inhomogeneous and develop\na separation of the gas phase from the liquid, i.e. water\nboils. As conventional canonical statistics works only for\nhomogeneous, infinite systems, phase separation remains\noutside of standard Boltzmann-Gibbs thermo-statistics.\nThe weight eS(E)\u2212E/T of the configurations with energy E in the definition of the canonical partition sum\nZ \u221e\nZ(T ) =\neS(E)\u2212E/T dE\n(13)\n0\n\nbecomes here bimodal, at the transition temperature it\nhas two peaks, the liquid and the gas configurations\nwhich are separated in energy by the latent heat. Consequently S(E) must be convex and the weight in (13)\nhas a minimum between the two pure phases. Of course,\nthe minimum can only be seen in the microcanonical ensemble where the energy is controlled and its fluctuations forbidden. Otherwise, the system would fluctuate\nbetween the two pure phases by an, for macroscopic systems even macroscopic, energy \u2206E \u223c Elat of the order of\nthe latent heat. I.e. the convexity of S(E) is the generic\nsignal of a phase transition of first order and of phaseseparation[1]. It is amusing that this fact that is essential\nfor the original purpose of Thermodynamics to describe\nsteam engines was never treated correctly in the past 150\nyears.\nThe ferromagnetic Potts-model illuminates in a most\nsimple example the occurrence of a convex intruder in\nS(E) which induces a backbending caloric curve T (E) =\n(\u2202S/\u2202E)\u22121 with a decrease of the temperature T (E) with\nrising energy [11][28]. A typical plot of s(e, N ) = S(E =\nN e)/N in the region of phase separation is shown in\nfig(1). Section IV discusses the general microscopic reasons for the convexity.\nThis has far reaching consequences which are crucial\nfor the fundamental understanding of thermo-statistics\nand Thermodynamics: Let us split the system of figure (1) into two pieces a & b by a dividing surface,\nwith half the number of particles each. The dividing\n\nFIG. 1: Ferromagnetic Potts model (q = 10) on a 50 \u2217 50lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the region of\nphase separation. At the energy e1 per lattice point the system is in the pure ordered phase, at e3 in the pure disordered\nphase. At ea little above e1 the temperature Ta = 1/\u03b2 is\nhigher than T2 and even more than Tb at eb a little below\ne3 . At ea the system separates into a few bubbles of disordered phase embedded in the ordered phase or at eb into a\nfew droplets of ordered phase within the disordered one. If we\ncombine two equal systems: one with the energy per lattice\nsite ea = e1 + \u2206e and at the temperature Ta , the other with\nthe energy eb = e3 \u2212 \u2206e and at the temperature Tb < Ta ,\nand allowing for free energy exchange, then the systems will\nequilibrize at energy e2 with a rise of its entropy. The temperature Ta drops (cooling) and energy (heat) flows (on average)\nfrom b \u2192 a. I.e.: Heat flows from cold to hot! Thus, the\nClausius formulation of the Second Law is violated. This is\nwell known for self-gravitating systems. However, this is not\na peculiarity of only gravitating systems! It is the generic situation at phase separations within classical thermodynamics\neven for systems with short-range coupling and has nothing\nto do with long-range interactions.\n\nsurface is purely geometrical. It exists only as long\nas the two pieces can be distinguished by their different energy/particle ea and eb . Constraining the energydifference eb \u2212 ea = \u2206e between the two, reduces the\nnumber of free, unconstrained degrees of freedom and reduces the entropy by \u22122\u2206Ssurf \u2212corr.. (Moreover, if the\n\n\f4\neffect of the new surface would also be to cut some bonds:\nbefore the split there were configurations with attractive\ninteractions across the surface which are interrupted by\nthe division, their energy shifts upwards outside the permitted band-width \u01eb0 , and thrown out of the partition\nsum (3). I.e. the entropy will be further reduced by the\nsplit.)\nIf the constraint on the difference eb \u2212ea is fully relaxed\nand eb \u2212 ea can fluctuate freely at fixed e2 = (ea + eb )/2,\nthe dividing surface is assumed to have no further physical effect on the system.\nFor an extensive system [S(E, N ) = N s(e = E/N ) =\n2S(E/2, N/2)]. One would argue as follows: The combination of two pieces of N/2 particles each, one at\nea = e2 \u2212\u2206e/2 and a second at eb = e2 +\u2206e/2, must lead\nto S(E2 , N ) \u2265 S(Ea /2, N/2) + S(Eb /2, N/2), the simple\nalgebraic sum of the individual entropies because by combining the two pieces one normally looses information.\nThis, however, is equal to [S(Ea , N ) + S(Eb , N )]/2, thus\nS(E2 , N ) \u2265 [S(Ea , N ) + S(Eb , N )]/2. I.e. the entropy\nS(E, N ) of an extensive system is necessarily concave.\nFor a non-extensive system we have in general\nS(E, N ) \u2265 2S(E/2, N/2) because again two separated,\nclosed pieces have more information than their unification. Now, if E2 is the point of maximum positive curvature of S(E, N ) (convexity = upwards concave like\ny = x2 ) we have S(E2 , N ) \u2264 [S(Ea , N ) + S(Eb , N )]/2\nlike in fig.(1). However, the r.h.s. is larger than\nS(Ea /2, N/2) + S(Eb/2, N/2). I.e. even though S(E, N )\nis convex at const. N , the unification of the pieces with\nEa /2, N/2 and Eb /2, N/2 can still lead to a larger entropy S(E2 , N ).\nThe difference between [S(Ea , N ) + S(Eb , N )]/2\nand S(Ea /2, N/2) + S(Eb /2, N/2) we call henceforth\n\u2206Ssurf \u2212corr . The correct entropy balance, before and\nafter establishing the energetic split eb > ea of the system, is\n\n(slope), but in the direction of the energy-slope, the entropy Stotal \u2192 S2 increases. This is consistent with the\nnaive picture of an energy equilibration. Thus Clausius'\n\"energy flows always from hot to cold\", i.e. the dominant control-role of the temperature in thermo-statistics\n[7] is violated. Of course this shows again that unlike\nto extensive thermodynamics the temperature is not the\nappropriate control parameter in non-extensive systems.\nIn the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e of a system with short-range coupling \u2206Ssurf \u2212corr. \u223c N 2/3 ,\n\u2206Ssurf \u2212corr. /N = \u2206ssurf \u2212corr. \u221d N \u22121/3 must go to 0\ndue to van Hove's theorem.\n\nSa + Sb\n\u2212\u2206Ssurf \u2212corr. \u2212S2 \u2264 0 (14)\n2\n\nIn this case the system is controlled by energy and volume.\n\nSaf ter \u2212Sbef ore =\n\neven though the difference of the first and the last term\nis positive.\nIn the inverse direction: By relaxing the constraint and\nallowing, on average, for an energy-flux (\u2206Eb\u2192a > 0) opposite to Ta \u2212 Tb > 0, against the temperature-gradient\n\nIV. THE MICROCANONICAL MECHANISM\nLEADING TO CONDENSATION, PHASE\nSEPARATION AND THE ORIGIN OF THE\nCONVEXITIES OF S(E)\n\nMany theoretical applications of microcanonical thermodynamics to realistic examples of hot nuclei, atomic\nclusters, and rotating astro-physical systems have been\nbeen presented during the past 20 years and show convex intruders in the microcanonical entropy and, consequently, negative heat capacities, c.f. e.g. the publication\nlist on my WEB-site http://www.hmi.de/people/gross/,\nsee also refs.[12\u201315].

For a\nfinite system we expect the analogue. However, here it\nis controlled by the constant available system volume V.\nAt low energies the N particles condensate into a droplet\nwith much smaller volume V0N , the system does not fill\nthe volume V. N \u2212 1 internal coordinates are limited to\nV0N . Only the center of mass of the droplet can move\nfreely in V (remember we did not fix the C.M. in eq.(16) ).\nThe system does not fill the 3N -configuration space V N .\n1/3\nOnly a stripe with width V0N in 3(N \u2212 1) dimensions\nof the total 3N -dim space and with the width V 1/3 in\nthe remaining 3 dimensions of center of mass motion is\npopulated. The system is non-homogeneous even though\nit is equilibrized and, at low energies, internally in the\nsingle liquid phase. It is not characterized by an intensive\nhomogeneous density.

Only the potential holes\n(clusters) in the 3N -dim potential surface \u03a6int [{r}] remain. Their volume V N (E, N ) \u2264 V N is the accessible\npart of the 3N -dim-spatial volume where \u03a6int [{r}] \u2264 E.\nI.e. V N (E, N ) is the total 3N -dim. eigen-volume of the\ncondensate (droplets), with N particles at the given energy, summed over all possible partitions, clusterings, in\n3N -configuration space.

The system behaves like an ideal gas and fills the volume V. At\n\u2192\nsufficiently low energies only the minimum of \u03a6int [{ r }]\nis explored by Wint (E \u2212 E0 , N, V). The system is in a\ncondensed phase, a single liquid drop, which moves freely\ninside the empty larger volume V, the 3(N \u2212 1) internal\ndofs are trapped inside the reduced volume V0N \u226a V.\nOne can guess the general form of N ln[V(E, N )]: Near\nthe groundstate E >\n\u223c E0 it must be flat \u2248 (N \u22121) ln[V0N ]+\nln[V \u2212 V0N ] because the liquid drop has some eigenvolume V0N in which each particle can move (liquid).\nWith rising energy ln[V(E, N )] rises up to the point\n(Etrans ) where it is possible that the drop fissions into\ntwo. Here an additional new configuration opens in 3N dim configuration space: Either one particle evaporates\nfrom the cluster and explores the external volume V, or\nthe droplet fissions into two droplets and the two CM\ncoordinates explore the larger V. This gives a sudden\nV\u2212V0(N \u22121)\njump in Sint (E) by something like \u223c ln{ V0(N\n} and\n\u22121)\nsimilar in the second case.\nOf course, this sudden opening of additional parts of\nthe 3N -dim. configuration space gives also a similar jump\nupwards in the total entropy\nS(E) = Sid\u2212gas\n+ Sint\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011(3N \u22122)/2\n\u2192\n(26)\n\u221d ln\nd3N r E \u2212 \u03a6int [{ r }]\nVN\n\nV\u2212V0(N \u22121)\nln{ V0(N\n}.\n\u22121)\n\nby \u223c\nLater further such \"jumps\" may\nfollow. Each of these \"jumps\" induce a convex upwards\nbending of the total entropy S(E) (eq.17). Each is connected to a bifurcation and bimodality of eS(E)\u2212E/T and\nthe phenomenon of phase-separation.\nIn the conventional canonical picture for a large number of particles this is forbidden and hidden behind the\nfamiliar Yang-Lee singularity of the liquid to gas phase\ntransition.\nIn the microcanonical ensemble this is analogue to the\nphenomenon of multifragmentation in nuclear systems\n[1, 16]. This, in contrast to the mathematical Yang-Lee\ntheorem, physical microscopic explanation of the liquid\nto gas phase transition sheds sharp light on the physical origin of the transition, the sudden change in the\ninhomogeneous population of the 3N -dim. configuration\nspace.\n\nC.\n\nThe gas\u2013liquid transition is linked to the transition\nfrom uniform filling of the container volume V by the\ngas to the smaller eigen-volume of the system V0 in its\ncondensed phase where the system is non-homogeneous\n(some liquid drops inside the larger empty volume V).\nFirst 3(N \u2212 1), later at higher energies less and less positional degrees of freedom condensate into the drop. First\nthree, then more and more dofs. (C.M.-coordinates of\nthe drops) explore the larger container volume V leading\nto upwards jumps (convexities) of Sint (E). The volume\nof the container controls how close one is to the critical end-point of the transition, where phase-separation\ndisappears. Towards the critical end-point, i.e. with\nsmaller V the jumps ln[V \u2212 V0 ] \u2212 ln[V0 ] become smaller\nand smaller. In the case of the solid\u2013liquid transition,\nhowever, the external volume V of the container confines\nonly the C.M.-position of the crystal resp. the droplet.\nAs long as both d3 and V0N remain small compared to V,\nthe latter has no direct influence on Sint (E). The entropy\njumps during melting are by \u2206Sint \u221d ln V0N \u2212 ln d3 .\nAt the surface of a drop \u03a6int > E0 = min \u03a6int , i.e. the\nsurface gives a negative contribution to Sint in eq.(22)\nand to S at energies E >\n\u223c E0 , as was similarly assumed in\nsection (III) and explicitly in eq.(14).\nV.\n\nSolid\u2013liquid transition\n\nIn contrast to the liquid phase, in the crystal phase\na molecule can only move locally within its lattice cage\nof the size d3 instead of the whole volume V0N of the\ncondensate.

For number of states we have after\nthese simplifying assumptions, cf. eq.(43):\nX\nW \u221d\nW\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n(37)\n\nequal to the ideal gas value, independently of whether\nthe system is condensed or not. (Remember, in eq.(27)\nwe assumed for simplicity that \u03a6\u03bb has a flat bottom).\n\nW\u03bb = (V \u2212 V0N \u2212 \u03bbd)\u03bb \u00d7 (V0N )N \u2212\u03bb\n\n(44)\n\nThe form of W\u03bb as function of the external volume is\nshown in fig(2):\nEvidently, W\u03bb (V ) is for every V a sharp monodispersed function of number of clusters and shows no\n\n\f8\nbimodality v.s. \u03bb. Consequently there is no phaseseparation also in the P (V) curve. This is not a phasetransition of first order.\n\nFIG. 2: Simplified Alder-Wainwright transition, Normalized\ncluster-number (\u03bb) distributions W\u03bb (V) as function of the external volume V.\n\n[1] D.H.E.

E.g. the particle density is\n\nnot changed and there are no chemical reactions.\n[28] This backbending of T (e) has nothing to do with the\nperiodic boundary condition used here, as claimed erroneously by Moretto et.al [19]. Many realistic microcanonical calculations for nuclear fragmentation as also for\natomic-cluster fragmentation, c.f. [1, 20], show the backbending without using periodic boundaries. These are verified by numerous experimental data in nuclear physics\nc.f. [21, 22] and cluster physics [23, 24].
