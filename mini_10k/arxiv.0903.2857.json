Using luminosities and\nstructural parameters of nGCs in low-mass (mainly late-type) dwarf galaxies from HST/ACS\nimaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (\u03c5esc ) of stellar ejecta to reach the cluster\ntidal radius and compare them with those of EHB-GCs. We show that nGCs in dwarf galaxies\nare very similar in their photometric and structural properties (colour hV \u2212 Ii = 0.9, magnitudes hMV i < \u22129 mag, ellipticities h\u01ebi = 0.11) to EHB-GCs. The nGCs populate the same MV\nvs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the largest EHB-GCs like\n\u03c9 Cen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh of an nGC could increase due to\nsignificant mass loss in the cluster vicinity and the resulting drop in the external potential in\nthe core once the dwarf galaxy dissolves. For EHB-GCs, we find a correlation between the\npresent-day \u03c5esc and their metallicity as well as (V \u2212I)0 colour. The similar \u03c5esc , (V \u2212I)0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs implies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations.\nThe \u03c5esc \u2013[Fe/H] relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity\nwith metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters typically show\nmore peculiarities in their stellar population than more metal-rich clusters of the same mass\ndo. Thus the cluster \u03c5esc can be used as parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment.\nAll our findings support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky\nWay.\nKey words: galaxies: dwarf \u2013 galaxies: irregular \u2013 galaxies: star clusters \u2013 galaxies: nuclei\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nSeveral studies have suggested that nuclear clusters of dwarf galaxies may be the progenitors, upon accretion, of the most massive globular clusters (GCs) in a galaxy (e.g., Zinnecker et al.\n1988; Freeman 1993). The most prominent case in our Galaxy\nis that of the GC M 54, which sits in the core of the Sagittarius\ndwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) (e.g. Ibata et al. 1997; Monaco et al.\n2005; Bellazzini et al. 2008). The goal of the current study is\nto test this suggestion by means of a comparison of the properties of nuclear clusters in low-mass galaxies with those of the\nmassive Galactic GCs. Recent studies based on deep observa-\n\n\u22c6\n\nThis study is based on archival data of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space\nTelescope, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS\n5\u201326555.\n\u2020 E-mail: iskren@astro.uni-bonn.de\n\ntions of Galactic GCs challenged the traditional view of GCs\nbeing composed of a simple stellar population with homogeneous age and metallicity. Most massive Galactic GCs for which\ndeep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available exhibit multiple branches in their colour-magnitude diagrams such as\n\u03c9 Cen (Lee et al. 1999; Hilker & Richtler 2000; Bedin et al. 2004;\nVillanova et al. 2007), NGC 2808 (Piotto et al. 2007), NGC 1851\n(Milone et al. 2008) and NGC 6388 (Piotto 2008). This implies\nthat they host sub-populations with different chemical abundances\nand/or ages (e.g. \u03c9 Cen, Hilker et al. 2004). The presence of\nmultiple stellar populations has recently stimulated studies on\nformation mechanisms to explain the complex stellar populations in GCs such as capturing of field stars (Fellhauer et al.\n2006; Pflamm-Altenburg & Kroupa 2007), repeated gas accretion (Walcher et al. 2005; Pflamm-Altenburg & Kroupa 2009),\nmerging of star clusters formed within the same GMC\n(Mackey & Broby Nielsen 2007). The currently most favored\n\n\f2\n\nI. Y. Georgiev et al.\n\nmechanism to explain the multiple stellar populations and hot\nHB stars is the cluster self-enrichment from stars with enhanced\nmass-loss enriching the interstellar medium with He and other\nlight elements, i.e. (5 \u2212 8M\u2299 ) AGB stars (e.g. Ventura & D'Antona\n2008) or massive fast-rotating stars (Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006;\nDecressin et al. 2007a). Helium enrichment from such sources is\nrequired to explain the sub-populations and the hot, core-helium\nand shell-hydrogen burning stars on the extension of the horizontal branch (HB) in GCs (D'Antona et al. 2002; Piotto et al. 2005;\nMaeder & Meynet 2006). Note however, that the late He flasher\nscenario also can explain the extremely hot HB stars (blue hook\nstars) as stars which have experienced extreme mass-loss and\nlate He-flash while descending to the white dwarf sequence (e.g.\nBrown et al. 2001; Moehler et al. 2007).\nInterestingly, NGC 2419, the largest and among the most luminous GCs, has a very well defined population of hot stars on\nthe extension of the HB, identical to \u03c9 Cen (Sandquist & Hess\n2008; Dalessandro et al. 2008), but shows no clear evidence for\nmultiple stellar populations and/or metallicity spread as deduced\nfrom its well defined red clump and narrow red giant branch in its\nHST/WFPC2 CMD (Ripepi et al. 2007).\nTypically the most complex clusters are among the most massive ones. Based on multivariate principle component analysis\nof various properties of Galactic GCs, Recio-Blanco et al. (2006)\nshowed that there is a strong correlation between the HB extension\n(i.e., the maximum temperature reached on the HB) and the cluster total mass, accounting for up to 60% of the HB variation. In\naddition, Dieball et al. (2009) showed that \"blue hook\" stars (hotter than the EHB, T eff & 31000 K, but with a similar FUV\u2013NUV\ncolour) are observed only in the most massive Galactic GCs. Therefore, the cluster mass is as important parameter for driving the HB\nmorphology as the cluster metallicity and age. In this respect a\nmore massive cluster (forming in a more massive giant molecular\ncloud, GMC) would be able to more efficiently retain stellar ejecta\nthan a less massive one, thus leading to a higher degree of selfenrichment. Recently, Lee et al. (2007) have shown that Galactic\nclusters with extended HBs (EHB-GCs), besides being among the\nmost massive GCs in the Galaxy, form a kinematically distinct population along with the metal-poor \"Young Halo\" (YH) GCs. The\nfact that both the total orbital energy and the maximum distance\nfrom the Galactic plane correlate with the cluster metallicity for\nbulge/disc (BD) and non-EHB \"Old Halo\" (OH) GCs is consistent\nwith the dissipational formation (Eggen et al. 1962) of those clusters together with the Galactic bulge and halo. The lack of such\na correlation for YH-GCs and most of the EHB-GCs is consistent\n(Lee et al. 2007) with their formation in the cores of Galactic building blocks (Searle & Zinn 1978) or in the nuclear regions of now\ndefunct dwarf galaxies. If the most massive Galactic GCs had their\norigin as such nuclear clusters, they would have the ideal conditions for self-enrichment processes to take place. The retained stellar ejecta in the deep potential well can lead to the formation of\nstellar populations with different metallicities and/or ages.\nOne place to look for the progenitors of the peculiar Galactic EHB-GCs thus are the nuclear regions of galaxies harboring\nnuclear star clusters. Deep space\u2013 and ground-based observations\nhave recently established that many galaxies, irrespectively of their\nmorphological type, contain star clusters at their nuclear regions.\nIn particular, the frequency of nuclear clusters (NCs) in early-type\nspiral galaxies (Sa-Sc) with little or no bulge has been observed\nto be \u223c 50% (e.g. Carollo et al. 1997), in face-on late-type spirals (Scd-Sm) \u223c 75% (B\u00f6ker et al. 2002) and in bulgeless edgeon spirals \u223c 65% (Seth et al. 2006). These fractions should be\n\nregarded as lower limits as the detection of NCs depends on the\nspatial resolution of the observations. Spectra of NCs in late-type\ndisc galaxies shows that they span a wide range in their luminosity weighted age from 10 Myr to 11 Gyr with spectra best described by age-composite stellar populations and masses in the\nrange 8 \u2212 60 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 (Walcher et al. 2005, 2006; Seth et al. 2006)\nwith the tendency of lower-mass NCs to be mainly found in later\nrather than earlier type spirals (Rossa et al. 2006). The presence of\nNCs in dwarf elliptical galaxies has been established for a long time\n(e.g. Reaves 1983). However, due to their high surface brightness\nand low photometric completeness of previous surveys the question of NC frequencies in ellipticals has been largely debated. Using deep HST/ACS imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2006) showed that at least 66% (and as high\nas 87%) of the observed galaxies possess NCs. So far there are no\ndedicated studies of NCs in late-type dwarf galaxies.\nThe few existing observations of star clusters in late-type\ndwarfs show that the majority of the star clusters located in the\nnuclear regions (the inner 500 pc) of nearby dIrrs (e.g., M 82,\nNGC 1705) are found to be predominantly young (a few Myr,\nHo & Filippenko 1996; Smith et al. 2006; Westmoquette et al.\n2007). However, old nuclear clusters have been reported in two\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies (Puzia & Sharina 2008) as well as in\nseven dwarf irregular galaxies (Georgiev et al. 2008, 2009). The\nages of those clusters are > 4 Gyr as inferred from their integrated\nspectra and broadband colours. In the following, we will refer to\nthe old nuclear clusters in our sample as nuclear GCs (nGCs).\nIn order to address the suggestion that the most massive and\npeculiar Galactic GCs could have had their origin in an environment similar to the nuclear regions of dIrr galaxies, we study their\nluminosities, colours, structural parameters and escape velocity to\nreach the cluster tidal radius. In Section 2 we briefly describe our\ndataset and the selection of nGCs, while in Section 3 we perform\nthe comparison between nGCs and EHB-GCs including their photometric and structural properties and their escape velocities. The\nmain conclusions of this work are presented in Sect. 4.\n\n2 DATA\n2.1 Description\nThis study is based on a two-band (F606W and F814W) archival\nHST/ACS dataset of nearby (< 12 Mpc), low-luminosity (MV >\n\u221216 mag, L < 5 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 ), and mainly late-type dwarf galaxies\nwhich are located in low-density environments (in lose groups or\nin the halo regions of nearby galaxy groups). The dataset contains\n30 dIrrs, 2 dEs, 2 dSphs and 4 Sm dwarfs in which old GCs were\ndetected.

As presented in Georgiev et al. (2009)\nwe adopted the geometric centre of the isointensity contour at the\n10\u03c3 level above the background as the galaxy centre. Recently,\nSwaters et al. (2009) performed an HI kinematic analysis for a large\nsample of nearby late-type dwarf galaxies. We have two galaxies in\ncommon with their study: UGC 1281 and NGC 4163. The latter has\na bright GC in the inner region. Unfortunately, Swaters et al. (2009)\nwere unable to derive the kinematical centre for this galaxy (and\nseveral other dwarfs in their sample) and adopted their photometric\ncentre.\nTo define nuclear clusters we have constrained our selection\ncriteria to clusters with MV < \u22129 mag and within a projected distance of Rproj < 500 pc from the galaxy centre (cf. Fig. 1). As we\nwill discuss later, there seems to be a clear division at this particular magnitude between nGCs and the rest of the GCs in those\ndwarfs. The value of the adopted projected distance was based on\ndynamical friction-related arguments. The dynamical friction time\nscale for a gravitating object on a Keplerian orbit in an isothermal\nhalo is tdf \u221d (\u03c3 \u00d7 ri2 )/MCl , where \u03c3, ri and MCl are the local velocity dispersion (km/s), the initial distance from the centre (kpc)\nand the cluster mass (M\u2299 ), respectively (e.g. Binney & Tremaine\n2008). The adopted Rproj guarantees that a cluster with 104 M\u2299 in a\nfield of local \u03c3 \u223c 15 km/s would spiral toward the centre of the host\npotential on a time scale of tdf \u223c 5 Gyr. Such a cluster we classify\nas nGC. For the case of M 54 it has been shown by Monaco et al.\n(2005) that this cluster might have spiraled from ri . 4 kpc into the\ncentre of the Sgr dSph within tdf \u223c 10 Gyr.\nIn Figure 1 we show the radial distribution of the GCs in our\n\nsample dwarf galaxies as a function of their luminosities. With different symbols are shown blue and red GCs in dIrrs or dEs/dSphs\nas indicated in the figure legend. Red GCs are those with V \u2212 I >\n1.0 mag, which is the typical colour to separate metal-poor from\nmetal-rich GCs in a galaxy. The left and right panels show distributions of the cluster luminosities as a function of the projected\ngalactocentric distance \u221a(Rproj ) and Rproj normalized to the galaxy\neffective radius Reff = aeff \u00d7 beff , respectively. With dashed lines\nwe have indicated the adopted selection region. This resulted in the\nselection of eight nGCs in seven dIrrs and two nGCs in two dEs.\nWe summarize their properties in Table 1.\nThe radial distribution of the GCs in low-mass galaxies in\nFigure 1 shows that nearly all of the brightest (MV < \u22129 mag)\nclusters are located within Rproj 6 500 pc. This confirms the expectation based on dynamical friction above. The observed decrease of the average cluster luminosity with increasing Rproj implies that either dynamical friction is indeed strong in dwarfs,\ndriving predominantly the more massive GCs inwards (of which\nsome might merge to form the nGC, see numerical simulation by\nVesperini 2000). Another formation scenario is the \"biased formation\" of more massive GMCs in the nuclear regions of galaxies\nwhere the higher ambient pressure and density (Elmegreen 1993;\nBlitz & Rosolowsky 2006) favors the formation of more massive\nstar clusters (Harris & Pudritz 1994). Together with dynamical friction this greatly enhances the likelihood for the presence of highmass nuclear globular clusters.\nProbably a mixture of both processes can explain the observed\nMV vs. Rproj distribution of the GCs in our sample galaxies.\n\n\f4\n\nI.

A full-resolution image of the central region of UGCA 86 is shown in the lower right corner. Both panels have the same scale.\n\n2.3 The unique case of UGCA 86\nOne of the most interesting cases in our sample of dwarf irregular galaxies is UGCA 86 which hosts two nGCs. This galaxy has\nan absolute magnitude of MV = \u221216.13 mag (L = 2.4 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 ,\nGeorgiev et al. 2009), MHI = 1.6 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , calculated following\nRoberts & Haynes (1994) from the total flux measured by Stil et al.\n(2005) and a distance modulus of D = 2.96 Mpc derived by\nKarachentsev et al. (2006). UGCA 86 is at a projected distance of\n\u223c 81 kpc (94\u2032 ) southeast of the bright (MV = \u221221.78 mag) Scd\n\ngalaxy IC 342, thus providing a system similar to the Milky Way\nand the Magellanic clouds, although the latter is closer to its dominant host galaxy. In the left panel of Figure 2 we show a gray\nscale F606W-band HST/ACS image of UGCA 86 with iso-intensity\ncontours over plotted. Apart from the nGCs (white squares) this\ngalaxy hosts at least three more luminous clusters, but those have\nV \u2212 I colours consistent with an upper age estimate < 2 Gyr at\n[Fe/H] > \u22122.3 dex. One of those bright clusters is in the nuclear\nregion of UGCA 86 and likely gravitationally interacting with the\nother two. Thus, we might be witnessing the process of merging\n\n\fNuclear clusters in late-type dwarf galaxies\nU7369-10\n\n-12\nUA86-29\n\n-11\n\nGCCs in dIrrs\nnGCs\ndE/dSph/Sm\nnGCs\n\nU8638-03\n\nMV\n\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n\na)\nAll MW GCs\nStrong EHB\nModerate EHB\nnGCs\n\n-12\n-11\n\u03c9 Cen\nM54\n\nMV\n\n-10\nM15\n\n-9\n\nN6441\nN2419\nN2808\n\nN6388\n\n47Tuc\n\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n\nb)\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n(V-I)0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 3. colour-magnitude diagram for nuclear GCs (nGCs) in low-mass\ndwarf galaxies (squares in panels a) and b)) and Galactic GCs with extended horizontal branches (EHB-GCs, large circles in panel b).

Given the separation (ri < 0.4 kpc) and masses (M \u223c 105 M\u2299 ) the expected dynamical friction time scale is tdf 6 0.4 Gyr.\n\n3 COMPARISON BETWEEN GALACTIC EHB-GCS AND\nNGCS IN DWARF GALAXIES\n3.1 Colours, luminosities and sizes\nThe integrated nGC colours, luminosities and structural parameters\nfrom two band imaging can be used for a first order comparison of\nhow similar nuclear clusters and EHB-GCs are in their metallicity\nand mass distribution.\nIn Figure 3 we compare the colour-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) of GCs in our sample dwarf galaxies and Galactic GCs,\n\n5\n\nwhere we focus on the comparison between nGCs and EHB-GCs.\nIn panel a) we show the CMD of the dwarf galaxies GCs where\nnGCs in dIrrs and dEs are shown with filled and open squares, respectively. Although the nGCs were selected as the brightest and\nthe most centrally located clusters in our dwarf galaxies, it can be\nseen that they form a distinct, well separated group of objects at\nMV & \u22129 mag (3.4 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 ). Following the classification of the\nEHB-GCs by Lee et al. (2007) into clusters with strongly and moderately extended HBs (\u2206VHB > 3.5 mag for strongly extended), in\nFigure 3 b) we show these two groups with solid and open circles,\nrespectively. It can be seen that the two EHB-GC populations show\ndifferent magnitude distributions, with the EHB-GCs with hotter\nHBs being more luminous (and hence massive) on average. This reflects to some extent the known correlation between the maximum\nT eff on the HB and GC mass (Recio-Blanco et al. 2006). The open\nsquares in Figure 3 b) show the nGCs. They share the colour and\nmagnitude distributions of the Galactic EHB-GCs. This suggests\nthat nGCs have metallicity and mass distributions similar to the\nEHB-GCs, although the V \u2212 I colour is rather degenerate in age and\nmetallicity. If we assume a lower limit of the cluster age of 10 Gyr\nand (V \u2212 I) = 0.9 mag, its metallicity, as inferred from Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models (e.g. Bruzual & Charlot 2003) would\nbe [Fe/H] . \u22121.7. However, a cluster with the same colour could be\nas metal-rich as [Fe/H] . 0.4 and have an age of & 0.7 Gyr, which\nwould also significantly influence its mass estimate. Therefore, a\nsolid metallicity and/or age indicator (from integrated-light spectra or multi-band photometry) is crucial and required for a robust\nanalysis of nGC masses, ages and metallicities.\nNumerical simulations have shown that the globular cluster\nhalf-light radius (rh ) is a stable quantity over many cluster relaxation times (> 10 trh , Spitzer & Thuan 1972; Aarseth & Heggie\n1998), and hence it represents a good proxy for the initial conditions in which the cluster evolved. In Georgiev et al. (2009), we\nshowed that the rh evolution of GCs in low-mass dwarf galaxies\nis mainly governed by processes internal to the cluster due to the\nweak external tidal field of the host. Therefore, a similar rh distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs would indicate an evolution in\na similar tidal environment. In Figure 4 we compare the rh vs. MV\ndistribution of nGCs. The direct comparison in Figure 4 b) between\nnGCs and Galactic EHB-GCs shows that nGCs populate the region\noccupied mainly by the Galactic EHB-GCs with the hottest HBs,\nalthough they are not as extended as \u03c9 Cen, M 54 or NGC 2419.\nAlso, nGCs fill the gap at MV \u223c \u221210 mag between the latter and\nthe rest of the EHB-GCs.\nSince nGCs are in or close to the centre of the potential of\ntheir host galaxy, their tidal radius is relatively small. Upon accretion into the halo of a more massive galaxy their tidal radius rt can\nexpand, and rh as well, while the host dwarf galaxy will be disrupted. This is due to the change from strong to a weaker tidal field\nin the galaxy halo after the dwarf is destroyed. This is evident from\nthe identical rt for a cluster at 0.8 kpc in a dwarf galaxy and a cluster\nat 8 kpc in the Galaxy (Fig. 9 in Georgiev et al. 2009). Therefore, it\nis reasonable to expect that massive Galactic GCs (such as \u03c9 Cen,\nNGC 2419) with a large rh at present could have evolved from an\ninitially small rh they would have had if they originated as nGCs\nin dwarf galaxies. Further, M 54, which is still at the nucleus of the\nSgt dSph, has a smaller rh than \u03c9 Cen. The masses of M 54 and\nthe stellar component of the Sgr nucleus within 100 pc (derived by\nBellazzini et al. 2008) imply a mass ratio of \u223c 0.4. Thus, M 54 is\nstill embedded in a rather deep potential well and its tidal radius\nis still confined and defined by the deeper and stronger potential\nof the Sagittarius galaxy.

Filled and open circles and triangles in panel a) indicate\nclusters with V \u2212 I colours bluer or redder than (V \u2212 I) = 1 mag. The arrow\nin panel b) indicates the expected direction of the cluster evolution due to\nrh expansion and mass loss from tidal stripping upon accretion.\n\nRGC = 19.2 kpc (Harris 1996) M 54 might undergo a process of\nrt , and therefore rh expansion due to the loss of background stars\n(i.e. mass in its vicinity) and the resulting drop in cluster potential\nupon the disruption of the Sgr dSph. Perhaps NGC 2419, the most\nextended Galactic cluster, went through such rh expansion. Moreover, its high ellipticity (\u01eb = 0.14, Bellazzini 2007), matches the\naverage value of the nGCs ellipticity (\u01eb = 0.11, see Table 1), which\nfurther supports its external origin.\nDue to tidal stripping and bulge/disk shocking a cluster can\nalso lose a fraction of its mass. Ideta & Makino (2004) were able\nto reproduce with N-body modeling the surface brightness profile\nof \u03c9 Cen if it was stripped from a dE host galaxy with baryon mass\n1.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 without the need of including dark matter. As a consequence of the stripping, the cluster lost nearly 40% of its initial\nmass within 0.88 Gyr of the stripping process. Thus, the expected\ndirection of the cluster evolution is toward larger rh and dimmer\nmagnitude (smaller mass), as shown by the arrow in Figure 4.\nHowever, a detailed modeling is required to verify this scenario and quantify the degree of rh , MV evolution. It is also very\nimportant that the final orbit of the accreted cluster either is very\neccentric or circular with a large galactocentric radius so that the\ncluster will spend most of the time on its orbit in the galactic halo.\n\n3.2 Internal cluster escape velocity\nAs discussed in the introduction, the main parameters that govern\nthe HB morphology are the cluster mass, [Fe/H] and age. Here we\nwill show\n\u221a that the escape velocity to reach the cluster tidal radius\n\u03c5esc \u221d 2GMcl /rh , can be used as an additional parameter to quantify the ability of a cluster to retain processed material from stellar\nejecta. During cluster formation, if retained, this chemically enriched material can be used for the formation of subsequent stellar\npopulations, as recently observed in some massive GCs.\nIn order for enriched stellar ejecta to be kept within the cluster, their terminal velocity (\u03c5\u221e ) must be no greater than the escape velocity to reach the cluster tidal radius (\u03c5esc ). Leitherer et al.\n(1992) have shown that for hot and massive OB stars \u03c5\u221e scales\nwith metallicity as \u03c5\u221e \u221d Z 0.13 , while for AGB stars the relation is steeper, i.e \u03c5\u221e \u221d Z 0.5 L0.25 (e.g. Elitzur & Ivezi\u0107 2001;\nMarshall et al. 2004). A typical wind velocity of an AGB star derived from observations is 10 \u2212 20 km/s (e.g. Vassiliadis & Wood\n1993; Bloecker 1995; Habing & Olofsson 2003). Rapidly rotating stars are known to have radial mechanical winds at the equator (where at the breakup limit the centrifugal force overcomes\nthe gravity) with velocities from a few to a few hundred km s\u22121\n(Decressin et al. 2007b; Porter & Rivinius 2003). Supernovae have\nwinds with speed of thousands of km s\u22121 . Based on 2D hydrodynamical simulations, W\u00fcnsch et al. (2008) have shown that thermalized ejecta from massive stars in compact and massive clusters\nare dense enough to trigger density condensations and feed subsequent star formation. Therefore, massive stars rapidly (< 50 Myr)\ndeposit (through stellar winds and SNe explosions) a large fraction\nof their mass back into the immediate ISM. Due to stochastic effects, more massive clusters will have relatively more massive stars\n(drawn from the sparsely populated high-mass end of the IMF) than\nless massive clusters. More massive clusters also have a higher ca-\n\n\fNuclear clusters in late-type dwarf galaxies\n\nwhere rh and Mcl are the cluster half-light radius in parsecs and\ncluster mass in M\u2299 ; fc is a coefficient which takes into account the\ndependence of the escape velocity on the density profile of the cluster, i.e. its concentration c = log(rt /rc ). This coefficient was computed for King (1962) models by de-projecting the density profile\nand then calculating the potential as a function of radius. We calculated both, the cluster velocity needed to reach the cluster tidal\nradius and the one to reach infinity. The values we have used for\nfc are those at the tidal radius. They differ insignificantly from the\nvalues at infinity, i.e. leading to \u2206\u03c5esc < 1 km/s. Both fc values are\nlisted in Table 2. Calculating \u03c5esc involves knowledge of the cluster's half-light radius, mass and concentration. All these quantities\nare easily accessible from ground and space based observations of\nGCs in nearby galaxies. Given that the cluster mass is the quantity that varies more significantly (an order of magnitude) than rh\namong clusters, \u03c5esc mainly traces cluster mass.\nThe rh measurement of the GCs in our dwarfs is described in\ndetail in Georgiev et al. (2008, 2009). To compute cluster masses\nwe have used the luminosities we measured in Georgiev et al.\n(2008, 2009) and a M/L = 1.88, which is the mean M/L\nvalue for old LMC GCs (estimated from the measurements of\nMcLaughlin & van der Marel 2005). The basic properties and \u03c5esc\nof all GC candidates in our sample dwarf galaxies are provided in\nTable 3.\nFor the majority (85) of the Galactic GCs we have used the\nmost recent measurements by McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005)\nof their rh , concentration and M/L ratio, which is needed to estimate Mcl . For the remaining GCs we adopted the values in the\nHarris (1996) catalog and M/L = 2.0. Table 4 contains the basic properties of Galactic globular clusters compiled from Harris\n(1996) and McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005) used to calculate\n\u03c5esc . The first part of the table contains the MV , M, rh , c and \u03c5esc for\n85 GCs calculated or adopted from McLaughlin & van der Marel\n(2005). The rest of the GCs (second part of the table) are from\nthe entries in the Harris catalog supplemented with rh from\nMackey & van den Bergh (2005). We have updated the metallicity\nvalue of NGC 6440 from Origlia et al. (2008).\n3.3 \u03c5esc \u2212metallicity relation\nIn the light of the self-enrichment scenario, clusters have to retain\nenriched stellar ejecta from their first stellar population in order to\nshow the observed abundance anomalies and/or multiple horizontal\nbranches. Therefore, more massive (higher \u03c5esc ) cluster are likely to\nretain a larger amount of processed stellar material which can also\nlead to an increase of their (initial) metallicity. Therefore, we expect\nan \u03c5esc (mass)-metallicity relation. We should note, however, that a\nrecent model by Bailin & Harris (2009) of the mass\u2013metallicity relation (MMR) among the blue GCs in rich GC systems of massive\ngalaxies shows that the MMR can not arise from self-enrichment,\nbut rather from pre-enrichment of the GMC. However, their model\ndid not include feedback from stars with slow stellar winds and enhanced mass loss such as AGB stars and fast rotators.

However, 47 Tuc,\nwhich is (at least) as massive as most of the EHB-GCs and as metalrich as NGC 6441 and NGC 6388, doesn't show an extended HB.\nIn Figure 5 b), we show [Fe/H] vs. \u03c5esc for Galactic GCs.

It can be seen that there is a correlation between these\ntwo quantities for EHB-GCs. The dashed line shows the leastsquare fit to the EHB-GCs excluding M 15, which clearly stands\nout from the rest of the EHB-GCs. M 15 is a core collapsed cluster\n(e.g. Guhathakurta et al. 1996; Noyola & Gebhardt 2006, and refs\ntherein), which could have experienced a strong rh evolution. Such\nexpansion of its rh after core collapse occurs due to binary heating\nin the center (Baumgardt et al. 2002), resulting in a low presentday \u03c5esc . Thus, the initial \u03c5esc of M 15 was even higher. In addition,\na King profile does not represent well the surface brightness profile\nof a post-core collapse cluster (Trager et al. 1995), thus the fc we\nused to calculate \u03c5esc for c = 2.5 from the Harris catalog might be\nunderestimated. Pasquali et al. (2004) performed a simultaneous fit\nto the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profile of M 15 using a multi-mass King-Michie model. Using the values they obtain\nfor rc and rt , we estimated that M 15 has slightly larger concentration, c = 2.65. This implies an increase in \u03c5esc of about 10 km/s\nfrom its value calculated with c = 2.5 (cf. Table 2). Leaving the details about M 15 aside, we note that clusters to the left of the model\nlines are expected to be in the self-enrichment regime, which is\nconsistent with the observed peculiarities of the EHB-GCs.\nThe observation that the higher the cluster \u03c5esc , the more\nmetal-rich it is, may reflect the metallicity dependence of the terminal velocities of the stellar winds. The \u03c5esc of a metal-rich clus-\n\n5.43\n4.96\n***\n\nter must be higher in order to retain such fast winds. We suggest that this might be the reason why the majority of the metalrich Galactic GCs do not show EHBs while being as massive as\nthe metal-poor EHB-GCs. With a dotted curve in Figure 5 b we\nshow the relation between the stellar wind terminal velocity and\nmetallicity for an AGB star with T eff = 3000 K, M = 5M\u2299 and\nL = 104 L\u2299 using equation 2 in Leitherer et al. (1992). It is clear that\nthe \u03c5\u221e \u221d Z 0.13 proportionality is not as steep as the observed relation for \u03c5esc \u2212[Fe/H] for EHB-GCs. However, the Leitherer model is\ndesigned for studying radiative winds of hot (T eff > 15000 K) and\nmassive (M > 15M\u2299 ) stars, which have stellar winds > 1000 km/s\nand different mass loss rate. Thus this wind model is inappropriate in reproducing the wind properties of AGB stars. With a dashdotted line is shown the dust-driven AGB wind model of the form\n\u03c5\u221e \u221d Z 0.5 L0.25 (Marshall et al. 2004). The vertical normalization,\nwhich is a complex parameter reflecting the relation between the\ngas-to-dust ratio and Z (see Elitzur & Ivezi\u0107 2001), in this case is\nadopted as such to approximate the EHB-GCs distribution. With\na solid curve in Fig. 5 we show a least square fit to the EHB-GCs\nresulting in a flatter relation \u03c5\u221e \u221d Z 0.32 .\nIt is interesting to note that the Galactic GC NGC 6440\nhas very high present day \u03c5esc and a high metallicity (Fe/H =\n\u22120.56, Origlia et al. 2008), but is classified as cluster with a red\nHB. NGC 6440 is located in the inner Galactic bulge at (l, b) =\n(7.\u25e6 7, 3.\u25e6 8), i.e. RGC = 1.3 pc and R\u2299 = 8.4 pc (Harris 1996) and has\n\n\fNuclear clusters in late-type dwarf galaxies\n\n9\n\nTable 4.

Its HST/WFPC2 CMD (Fig. 4\nin Piotto et al. 2002) shows a well populated red clump, however,\nthe expected region of the extension of the HB (subluminous blue\nstars) falls in the magnitude range where the photometric errors are\nlarger than 0.1 mag, likely affected by the high reddening. Thus, the\nHB classification of NGC 6440 might not be very well established.\nUnfortunately, we do not have metallicity measurements for\nthe nuclear clusters in our sample dwarfs to perform a direct comparison in the same parameter space between nGCs and EHBGCs. This will require a spectroscopic follow-up. The closest parameter pair that corresponds to [Fe/H] vs. \u03c5esc is V \u2212 I vs. \u03c5esc ,\nwhich we show in Figure 6. As can be seen, nGCs coincide with\nthe Galactic EHB-GCs in the (V \u2212 I) \u2212 \u03c5esc parameter space. Although the V \u2212 I colour suffers from the age-metallicity degeneracy and its conversion to [Fe/H] is nonlinear depends on the\nchoice of the adopted SSP model, the [Fe/H] \u2212 \u03c5esc trend seen in\nFig 5 b) can also be noticed for the Galactic EHB-GCs in Fig. 6 a).\nThis is because Galactic GCs have a relatively small age spread\n( 1\u20132 Gyr), therefore the V \u2212 I colour will mainly trace the cluster metallicity. Previous studies, based on Galactic and/or GC data\nin other galaxies, derived linear relation between the V \u2212 I colour\nand metallicity (e.g. Kundu & Whitmore 1998; Kissler-Patig et al.\n1998; Harris et al. 2000; Sohn et al. 2006). Our nGCs, however,\nhave an unknown age-metallicity composition which is likely complex (Walcher et al. 2006; Puzia & Sharina 2008). Thus, combined\nwith the low number statistics, a linear transformation of their V \u2212 I\ncolour to metallicity would lead to an unreliable result, and therefore we do not present this exercise here.\n\n3.65\n4.40\n1.62\n2.58\n10.50\n6.20\n1.26\n6.58\n4.56\n***\n\nNote that \u03c5esc in Equation 1 is the present-day value, and hence\na lower estimate of the initial \u03c5esc . To compare \u03c5esc of a cluster directly with the terminal speed of the stellar ejecta as a function of\nmetallicity, one has to take the evolution of the GC mass and rh\nwith time into account. Due to stellar evolution a GC loses about\n40% of its initial mass and the increase of rh due to mass loss from\nstellar evolution is also about 40% if rh << rt (e.g., Hills 1980;\nBaumgardt & Makino 2003). These two effects would increase the\n\u03c5esc by a factor of 1.5 since the cluster was formed. However, the\nexact mass and rh evolution of a given cluster is determined by its\norbital parameters in the galaxy and the profile of its potential. The\nfact that the present-day \u03c5esc of EHB-GCs and nGCs are very comparable (cf. Fig. 6) indicates that they may well have experienced\nmass and size evolution in initially similar environments. To provide stronger constraints on this scenario, we suggest that accurate\nages of the nGCs shall be determined by means of follow-up spectroscopy or near-IR imaging.\n\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nIn order to address the hypothesis that massive peculiar Galactic GCs, mainly those with hot horizontal branches (EHB-GCs),\noriginated from nuclear clusters of accreted and now disrupted\ndwarf galaxies or were the former cores of massive Galaxy building blocks, we have performed a comparison of their properties\nwith that of nuclear clusters in low-mass dwarf galaxies, mainly\nlate-type irregulars.

We\ndiscuss that such a relation could arise due to two mechanisms:\ndynamical friction, shown to be strong in low-mass galaxies\n(Vesperini 2000), or biased massive cluster formation toward\nlower Rproj reflecting the dependence of the size of giant molecular\nclouds (GMCs) on the ambient pressure, which increases with\ndecreasing Rproj .\nWe observe that the nGCs seem to form a distinct population\nof clusters being brighter than MV < \u22129 mag and sharing a similar colour and luminosity distribution as the EHB-GCs. The similar V \u2212 I colour between nGCs and EHB-GCs also indicates that\nthey have similarly low metallicities, although this needs to be confirmed with spectroscopy and/or near-IR imaging due to the strong\nage-metallicity degeneracy of the V \u2212 I colour.\nThe nuclear GCs in our sample dwarfs are distributed in the\nrh vs. MV plane in a region which connects the majority of the\nEHB-GCs and the most extended ones such as \u03c9 Cen, NGC 2419\nand M 54, the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal. If such\nGalactic clusters had their origin as nGCs, it is expected that their\nrh will suffer expansion upon accretion and disruption of the dwarf\ndue to mass loss resulting in a drop of the cluster potential, i.e. the\nchange from strong (in the dwarf nuclear region) to a weaker (in the\ngalaxy halo) gravitational potential. This could be the reason for the\nlarge present-day rh of those Galactic EHB-GCs and the relatively\nsmaller ones (on average) of the nGCs in our dwarf galaxies. A detailed modeling of this mechanism is required in order to quantify\nthe cluster rh expansion.\nAnother indicator that EHB-GCs could have originated in the\ncores of dwarf galaxies is that of their chemical peculiarities, which\ncould arise if they were capable to retain processed stellar ejecta of\nfast evolving massive stars. We showed that the escape velocity\nto reach the cluster tidal radius for EHB-GCs scales with cluster\n[Fe/H] in a similar manner (though much steeper) as the relation\nbetween the terminal velocity of the stellar wind and metallicity.\nThus, a metal-poor cluster will have better capability to retain stellar ejecta than a metal-rich cluster of the same mass.\nDue to the lack of metallicity measurements of the nGCs in\nour sample we compare them with the EHB-GCs in the V \u2212I vs. \u03c5esc\nparameter space (Fig. 6). They are found to occupy region with similar in colour and \u03c5esc as EHB-GCs which indicates that nGCs could\nhave retained ejecta from massive and intermediate-mass stars as\ndid EHB-GCs. Therefore, nGCs can have as complex stellar populations as the EHB-GCs. However, more robust age and metallicity\nestimates for nGCs are required to confirm this.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nability of a cluster to retain enriched stellar ejecta which are required in the self-enrichment scenario to explain the complexity of\nthe stellar populations recently observed in Galactic GCs.\nThe sample of nuclear clusters was presented in\nGeorgiev et al. (2008, 2009) and is based on two band F606W\nand F814W archival HST/ACS imaging. Because the V \u2212 I colour\nof those clusters is consistent with an age of > 4 Gyr, i.e. likely\ntypical old GCs, we have termed them nuclear GCs (nGCs). Based\non dynamical friction-related arguments, we selected eight nGCs\nin seven dIrr and two nGCs in two dEs with MV < \u22129 mag within\nprojected galactocentric distances of Rproj < 500 pc (cf. Table 1).\nThose clusters could have formed either at their present location\nor spiraled in due to dynamical friction within 4 Gyr.
