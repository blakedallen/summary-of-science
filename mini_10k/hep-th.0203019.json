The basic feature of these inflationary models is the existence of two phases in the\nevolution of the universe: a slow-roll inflation in the de Sitter valley of the potential (the\nCoulomb phase of the gauge theory) and a tachyon condensation phase, or 'waterfall stage',\ntowards the ground state Minkowski vacuum (a Higgs phase in gauge theory).\nIn N = 1 supersymmetric theories, hybrid inflation may arise as F-term inflation [2, 3] or\nD-term inflation [4]. In N = 2 supersymmetric theories there is a triplet of Fayet-Iliopoulos\n(FI) terms, \u03be r , where r = 1, 2, 3. Choosing the orientation of the triplet of FI terms, \u03be r ,\nin directions 1,2, F-term inflation is promoted to N = 2 supersymmetry [6]. The more\ngeneral case with N = 2, when all 3 components of the FI terms are present, is called Pterm inflation [7]. When \u03be 3 is non-vanishing, a special case of D-term inflation with Yukawa\ncoupling related to gauge coupling is recovered. In this fashion, the two supersymmetric\nformulations of hybrid inflation are unified in the framework of N = 2 P-term inflation.\nThis gauge theory has the potential [7]\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\ng2 \u2020\n1 r 2\n2\n2\nr g \u2020 r\nr\nV = \u03a6 \u03a6(A + B ) \u2212 (P ) + P\n,\n(1.1)\n\u03a6 \u03c3 \u03a6+\u03be\n2\n2\n2\nwhere P r is a triplet of auxiliary fields of the N = 2 vector multiplet, \u03a6\u2020 , \u03a6 are 2 complex\nscalars forming a charged hypermultiplet, A, B are scalars from the N = 2 vector multiplet\nand g is the gauge coupling. The auxiliary field satisfies the equation P r = \u2212(g\u03a6\u2020 \u03c3 r \u03a6/2+\u03be r )\nand the potential simplifies to\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nr 2\n1\n\u03be\ng2\n\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6(A2 + B 2 ) +\n.\n(1.2)\n\u03a6\u2020 \u03c3 r \u03a6 +\nV =\n2\n2\ng\nAn additional advantage of using N = 2 supersymmetric models for inflation is the\npossibility to link it to M/string theory where cases with N = 2 supersymmetry are simpler\nand less arbitrary than the cases with N = 1 supersymmetry.\nIn our first attempt2 to link string theory to a gauge model with a hybrid potential [8],\nwe used a system with a D4-brane attached to NS5-branes and having a small angle relative\nto a D6-brane, so that the Coulomb phase of the theory is slightly non-supersymmetric and\nforces the D4 to move towards the D6-brane (see also [9]). This setup reproduces accurately\nthe properties of the non-supersymmetric de Sitter vacuum of P-term inflation, for which\n(P r )deSit = \u2212\u03be r and (V )deSit = \u03be~2 /2. In particular, the mass splitting of the scalars in the\nhypermultiplet (e.g. for the case of \u03be 3 = \u03be 6= 0)\n2\n\n2\nMhyper\n= g 2 (A2 + B 2 ) \u00b1 g\u03be ,\n\nEarlier studies of brane inflation were performed in [10, 11].\n\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fis reproduced by the low-lying string states; the attractive force between the D4 and D6brane is a one loop effect from the open string channel, and correctly reproduces the one-loop\ngauge theory potential\n|A2 + B 2 |\n\u03be 2g 2\nln\n,\n(1.4)\n\u2206V =\n16\u03c0 2 |A2 + B 2 |c\nfor large values of the inflaton field. Notice the inflaton is the distance between D4 and D6\nin the brane model.\nWhen the distance between the branes becomes smaller than the critical distance\n|A2 + B 2 |c =\n\n\u03be\n,\ng\n\n(1.5)\n\nthe spectrum of 4-6 strings develops a tachyon. The tachyon condensation is associated to a\nphase transition. A final Higgs phase with unbroken N = 2 supersymmetry is described in\nthis model by a reconfiguration of branes: D6 cuts D4 into two disconnected parts, so that\nN = 2 supersymmetry is restored. From the viewpoint of the gauge theory it is described\nby a vanishing auxiliary field (P r )susy = 0, a vanishing vev of the inflaton field A = B = 0,\nand a vanishing potential (V )susy = 0. The hypermultiplet vev is not vanishing and has to\nsatisfy\ng \u2020 r\n\u03a6 \u03c3 \u03a6 = \u2212\u03be r .\n(1.6)\n2\nOne attractive feature of D4/D6/NS5 model is that the deviation from supersymmetry\nin the Coulomb stage can be very small and supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Nevertheless, a large number of e-foldings can be produced within a D-brane. Given the lessons\nfrom the D-brane approach to black hole physics, such small deviation from supersymmetry might be an advantage over brane/anti-brane models [11], for which the deviation from\nsupersymmetry is large.\nThe main difference between our model [8] and other models of brane inflation [9, 10, 11,\n12, 13] is that our model provides the brane description of the full potential of hybrid P-term\ninflation. This includes both the logarithmic quantum corrections to the Coulomb branch\npotential and the exit from inflation with the corresponding supersymmetric Minkowski\nvacuum.\nThe first purpose of this paper is to suggest a new model (partially dual to [8]) which\ngives a better description of the Higgs branch (exit from inflation) keeping the nice properties\nof the Coulomb branch (inflation). We will then argue that the stringy understanding of the\nexit from inflation provides a possible explanation for the existence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant. The second purpose is to suggest how this new model may be consistently\ncompactified to four dimensions, without spoiling its cosmological properties.\nThe model consists of a D3-brane parallel to a D7-brane at some distance, which again\nis the inflaton field. The supersymmetry breaking parameter is related to the presence of\nthe antisymmetric Fmn field on the worldvolume of the D7-brane, but transverse to the D3brane. When this field is not self-dual in this four dimensional space, the supersymmetry\nof the combined system is broken. This is (to some extent) a type IIB dual version of\n3\n\n\fthe cosmological model proposed in [8], which guarantees that the good properties in the\nCoulomb stage are kept; in particular the spectrum and the attractive potential should match\nthe ones of P-term inflation. One immediate simplification is that the NS5-branes are not\nneeded any longer.\nMore interestingly is the understanding of the Higgs stage. Equation (1.6) can be associated with the Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin construction of instantons with gauge group\nU(N). The moduli space of one instanton is the moduli space of vacua of a U(1) gauge theory with N hypermultiplets and (1.6) is the corresponding ADHM equation. This suggests\nthat in the brane construction of the cosmological model we may look for some instantons on\nthe worldvolume of the brane in the Higgs phase of the theory. We will find an abelian nonlinear instanton solution with associated ADHM equation (1.6). Moreover, the presence of a\ncosmological constant will translate as the resolution of the small size instanton singularity.\nOne other nice feature of the D3/D7 cosmological model is that it is well explained in\nterms of \u03ba-symmetry of the D7-brane action, both in Coulomb phase as well as in the Higgs\nphase.\nUnbroken supersymmetry of bosonic configurations in supergravity has already proved to\nbe an important tool in our understanding of M/string theory. To obtain BPS solutions of\nsupergravity one has to find Killing spinors, satisfying a condition \u03b4\u03c8 = 0 for all fermions and\nfind out how many non-vanishing spinors solve this equation for a given solution of bosonic\nequations. This allows to find configurations with some fraction of unbroken supersymmetry\nin supergravity.\nUnbroken supersymmetry of the bosonic configurations on the worldvolume of the \u03basymmetric branes embedded into some curved space (on shell superspace) was studied less\nso far. The condition of supersymmetric vacua in the context of the supermembrane was suggested in [14]. This condition was introduced more recently in the context of supersymmetric\ncycles in [15]. Later on, when more general \u03ba-symmetric brane actions were discovered in\n[16], it was established in [17] that for all cases of D-branes, M2 and M5 \u03ba-symmetric branes,\na universal equation for the BPS configurations on the worldvolume is given by (1 \u2212 \u0393) \u01eb = 0.\nHere \u0393(X \u03bc (\u03c3), \u03b8(\u03c3), Ai (\u03c3)) is a generator of \u03ba-symmetry and it should be introduced into\nthe equation for unbroken supersymmetry with vanishing value of the fermionic worldvolume\nfield \u03b8(\u03c3). The existence or absence of solutions to these equations will fit naturally in the\ntwo stages of our cosmological model.\nIn addressing compactification of such cosmological model to four dimensions, as to\nrecover four dimensional gravity, one is inevitably faced with the issue of anomalies. In many\ncases this is associated to the requirement that the overall charge in a compact space must\nvanish. We will point out that we can face our D3/D7 model within a more general setup,\nrelated to F-theory [18, 19, 20], where the D7-brane charge is cancelled by orientifold 7-planes\nor (p, q) 7-branes. This seems to provide a setup where, in string theory, the compactification\ncould be consistently performed3 . This is a particularly relevant issue for the cosmological\n3\n\nSome recent papers which also consider orientifold planes to describe the inflationary scenario are [13].\n\n4\n\n\fmodels with FI terms. It was shown by Freedman [21] that FI terms in N = 1, D = 4\nsupergravity must be accompanied by an axial gauging of gravitino and gaugino which\nmakes the theory anomalous. We then discuss the uplifting of the compactified, anomaly\nfree IIB model to M-theory, where it becomes simpler. We close with a discussion.\n\n2\n\nDe Sitter valley: separated D3/D7 system with fluxes\n\nWe will start by reviewing the spectrum of the D3/D7 system with a gauge field [22, 24].\nThe boundary conditions on the D7 side will depend on a gauge field on its surface. To\nunderstand the dynamics of the branes we will consider a D7-brane in a background of the\nD3-brane. We will allow a worldvolume gauge field on D7 and find that supersymmetry is\nbroken when this gauge field is not self-dual. The potential between branes will be shown\nto have a logarithmic dependence on the distance, as expected for broken supersymmetry.\nIn an alternative picture, a D3-brane will probe the background of a D7-brane with a\nbulk B field. The combined system will be supersymmetric under condition that the B field\nis self-dual. For the non-self-dual field we calculate the potential and find again a logarithmic\ndependence on the distance. Therefore we recover from the probe approximation, the gauge\ntheory and open string theory results [8].\n\n2.1\n\nPerturbative String theory analysis\n\nConsider a type IIB system with D3 and D7-branes plus a constant worldvolume gauge field\nF field along directions\n0 1 2 3\nD3 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nD7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nF\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\nTable 1\nThis is illustrated in figure 1.

The 3-3 strings give rise to the N = 2 vector\nmultiplet, the 7-3 strings to the hypermultiplet and the worldvolume gauge field F to the\nFI terms of the D = 4 gauge theory.\nNote that if F is self-dual, supersymmetry would be unbroken [22]. This will be explained\nvia \u03ba-symmetry in the next subsection. For future reference we define\nF \u00b1 = F \u00b1 \u22c6F ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nand similarly for B.\nLet us define complex coordinates:\nz 1 = x6 + ix7 ,\n\nz 2 = x8 + ix9 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe boundary conditions on the D3/D7 strings along the 6, 7, 8, 9, directions are therefore:\n(\u2202\u03c4 z k )\u03c3=0 = 0,\n\n(\u2202\u03c3 z k + tan \u03b8k \u2202\u03c4 z k )\u03c3=\u03c0 = 0 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\n(no sum on k) where k = 1, 2, and similar conditions for z\u0304 k (with tan \u03b8k \u2192 \u2212 tan \u03b8k ).

It only remains to find out the\nzero-point energy as a function of \u03bdk , in the NS sector.

The fermion in the multiplet have a mass\nM\u03c82 =\n\nd2\n,\n(\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 )2\n\n(2.14)\n\nas the contribution from the zero point energy to the Ramond sector is zero.\nThe higher states in the string spectrum satisfying the condition of spontaneously broken\nsupersymmetry StrM 2 = 0, also have tachyonic masses whose values and splitting are given\nin [8]. One can check however that it is the very first tachyon which provides a critical\n4\n\nWe are assuming \u03b81 > \u03b82 .\n\n7\n\n\fdistance between the branes, all other higher level tachyons always come at distances smaller\nthan the first one. Therefore already at d2c there is a phase transition and a waterfall stage\nsets on as the potential of the gauge theory suggests.\nThe F field plays the role of the Fayet-Illiopoulos term, from the viewpoint of the field\ntheory living on the D3-brane. It creates an instability in the system driving the D3-brane\ninto the D7-brane; this is the de Sitter stage. The evolution follows the description given\nin [8]. In particular, a tachyon will form and the system will end in a supersymmetric\nconfiguration which will be analyzed in section 3.\n\n2.2\n\nD7-brane worldvolume analysis and \u03ba-symmetry\n\nIn the presence of Fayet-Illiopoulos parameter, the system of D3 and D7-branes at some\ndistance from each other is unstable. It is instructive to see this instability from the viewpoint\nof the D7-brane worldvolume action\nZ\nZ X\np\n8\n\u2212\u03c6\nS = \u2212T7 d \u03c3e\n\u2212 det (g + F ) + T7\nCp+1 \u2227 eF ,\n(2.15)\n\nwhere g is the metric induced on the brane and F = F \u2212 B, where B is a pull-back of the\nNS-NS 2-form and F is the 2-form (F = dA) Born-Infeld field strength. We place our D7brane in the D3-brane background. The dilaton is constant while the metric and self-dual\nRR form read\nds2 = H \u22121/2 ds2 (E3,1 ) + H 1/2 ds2 (E6 ),\n(2.16)\n\u22121\ni\nRR\n\u22121\ni\nF = \u2202i H dx \u2227 \u01ebE3,1 + \u22c6(\u2202i H dx \u2227 \u01ebE3,1 ).\nH is the usual single center harmonic function on E6 , H = 1 + Q/r 4 , and \u01ebE3,1 is the\nvolume form on E3,1 . The embedding functions for the D7-brane are x\u03bc = \u03c3 \u03bc , where \u03bc =\n0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. We also turn on the worldvolume gauge field, with components (2.1).\nDenoting by V3 the volume along \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 , \u03c3 3 and allowing i = 6, 7, 8, 9, we find the effective\npotential,\n\u0014q\n\u0015\nZ\n2\n2\ni\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nV = T7 V3 d\u03c3\n(1 + H tan \u03b81 )(1 + H tan \u03b82 ) \u2212 (H \u2212 1) tan \u03b81 tan \u03b82 . (2.17)\n\nClearly, if \u03b81 = \u03b82 , the force between the D3 and D7 vanishes. This corresponds to a\nself dual configuration in the Euclidean four space R4 parameterized by directions 6 to 9.\nLet \u03c1 be the radial coordinate in this four space. Also denote d2 \u2261 (x4 )2 + (x5 )2 . Change\ncoordinates to \u03bb = \u03c12 + d2. For large distances, d4 >> Q, and up to a divergent term coming\nfrom the infinite volume of the brane, the potential can be rewritten as\nZ \u039b\n\u03c02\nd\u03bb\n2\nV \u2243 \u2212 QT7 V3 (sin \u03b81 \u2212 sin \u03b82 )\n,\n2\nd2 \u03bb\n(2.18)\n2\n2\nd\n\u03c0\n,\n= QT7 V3 (sin \u03b81 \u2212 sin \u03b82 )2 ln\n2\n\u039b\n8\n\n\fwhere we introduced the cutoff \u039b. This reproduces the attractive potential of hybrid inflation in accordance with the results discussed in [8]. Note that the choice of gauge for the\nsupergravity potential C4 is such that it vanishes at infinity and reproduces the right energy\nfor the D3/D7 bound state.\nThe breaking of supersymmetry manifest in the non-vanishing force between D3 and D7\ncan be deduced from general considerations of \u03ba-symmetric D7-brane in the background of\nD3-brane. The bosonic part of the action is given in eq. (2.15). Solutions of the equations\nfollowing from this action may have some unbroken supersymmetry5 if there are non-trivial\nspinor solutions to\n(1 \u2212 \u0393)\u01eb = 0 ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere the \u03ba-symmetry projector \u0393 for a D7-brane in a D3-brane background is given by [17]\na\n\na\n\n\u0393 = e\u2212 2 i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 e 2 = e\u2212a i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nHere \u01eb\u03b1I is a spinor of type IIB theory which has 32 independent components. It is represented by two Majorana spinors I = 1, 2 and \u03b1 = 1, . . . , 32, satisfying a chirality constraint;\n(\u03c32 )I J is a Pauli matrix and in the absence of the 'rotation' factor a this Killing equation\nwould just reproduce the D7-brane projector, (1 \u2212 i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 )\u01eb = 0, which would correspond to 1/2 of unbroken supersymmetry. We are looking for a configuration with an F = dA\non the worldvolume which is skew-diagonal, as in (2.1). The general relation between F and\na is rather complicated but it turns out to be very simple in our case since the choice of the\nskew-diagonal basis is possible for the matrix F : it is antisymmetric and independent on the\nworldvolume coordinates,\na = \u03c33 \u2297 (\u03b81 \u03b367 + \u03b82 \u03b389 ) = \u03c33 \u2297 H 1/2 (\u03b81 \u039367 + \u03b82 \u039389 ) ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere \u03b3i = Ei a \u0393a , and the vielbeins are given by the metric of the D3-brane. \u0393a are spacetime gamma-matrices. The presence of the F field affects the unbroken supersymmetry\nprojector of the D7-brane in D3 background and we find for the Killing spinors a condition:\nexp{\u2212\u03c33 \u2297 H 1/2 (\u03b81 \u039367 + \u03b82 \u039389 )}i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 \u01eb = \u01eb .\n\n(2.22)\n\nDue to the presence of the D3-brane background, the Killing spinor has also to satisfy the\nfollowing conditions\n\u01eb = H \u22121/4 \u01eb0 ,\n\ni\u03c32 \u2297 \u03930123 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 ,\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 is a constant spinor which breaks half of the supersymmetry. Taking this into\naccount in eq. (2.22) we reduce the problem to the following one\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n1/2\nexp \u2212 \u03c33 \u2297 H \u039367 [(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )(1 \u2212 \u03936789 ) + (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 )(1 + \u03936789 )] \u2297 \u03936789 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 . (2.24)\n2\n5\n\nWe are using notation of [17]\n\n9\n\n\fThe harmonic function of the D3 background at the position of the D7 brane d2 =\n(x4 )2 + (x5 )2 = 0 has the form, H = 1 + Q/\u03c14 where \u03c12 = (\u03c3 6 )2 + (\u03c3 7 )2 + (\u03c3 8 )2 + (\u03c3 9 )2 .\nEquation (2.24) shows that unless \u03b81 = \u03b82 there is no solution and all supersymmetries are\nbroken. Indeed if \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03b8 we find\nexp{\u2212\u03c33 \u2297 H 1/2 \u03b8 \u039367 (1 \u2212 \u03936789 )} \u2297 \u03936789 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe solution is \u01eb0 = \u03936789 \u01eb0 . Thus for self-dual F , F \u2212 = 0 our exact non-linear Killing\ncondition can be satisfied for the Killing spinors, subject to 2 projector equations\n\u01eb = i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 \u01eb\n\u01eb = \u03936789 \u01eb .\n\n(2.26)\n\nHowever, if \u03b81 6= \u03b82 , equation (2.24) can not be satisfied for non-vanishing \u01eb0 : the constraint\non constant spinors can not depend on a function of the worldvolume coordinates H(\u03c3).\nIt is important to stress here that H(\u03c3) is a function of the worldvolume coordinates\nwhich is fixed by the properties of the background. It will be quite different in the Higgs\nphase when an analogous situation will occur and it will be possible to use the independence\nof the corresponding function on the worldvolume coordinates as a condition for the nonlinear instanton equation.\n\n2.3\n\nD3-brane worldvolume analysis\n\nWe may see the instability in the D3/D7 system still in a different fashion. We take a D7brane geometry with a B-field obeying B \u2212 6= 0, probed by a D3-brane. A corresponding\nsupergravity solution can be taken in the following form (obtained by two T-dualities at an\nangle from the D5-brane solution):\n\u22121/2\n\nds2D7 = Z7\n\n1/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nds2 (E3,1 ) + Z7 ds2 (E245 ) + Z7\n\n\u22121/2\n\nH1 ds2 (E267 ) + Z7\n\nH2 ds2 (E289 ),\n\ne2\u03c6 = gs2 Z7\u22122 H1 H2 ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nB67 = \u2212 tan \u03b81 Z7\u22121 H1 , B89 = \u2212 tan \u03b82 Z7\u22121 H2 ,\n\u0001\nC4 = Z7\u22121 \u2212 1 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 \u01ebE3,1 ,\n\u0001\nC6 = Z7\u22121 \u2212 1 [H1 cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 dx6 \u2227 dx7 + H2 cos \u03b82 sin \u03b81 dx8 \u2227 dx9 ] \u2227 \u01ebE3,1 ,\n\u0001\nC8 = Z7\u22121 \u2212 1 H1 H2 cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 \u01ebE3,1 \u2227 dx6 \u2227 dx7 \u2227 dx8 \u2227 dx9 ,\n\nwhere ds2 (E2ij ) denotes the Euclidean two space parameterized by cartesian coordinates xi , xj\nand we have defined\n\u0001\u22121\n\u0001\u22121\n,\n, H2 = cos2 \u03b82 + sin2 \u03b82 Z7\u22121\ncos2 \u03b81 + sin2 \u03b81 Z7\u22121\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u0393(\u01eb/2)\n1/\u01eb\n= lim+ 1 + c7\n=\n1\n\u2212\n2c\nln\nr/e\n.\n7\n\u01eb\u21920\nr\u01eb\n\nH1 =\nZ7\n\n10\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fThe D3-brane probe action is given by\nZ\nZ\np\n4\n\u2212(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 )\n\u2212 det (g + F ) + TD3 C4 ,\nSD3 = \u2212TD3 d \u03c3e\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere the zero mode of the dilaton \u03c60 is defined by e\u03c60 = gs .\nFor our application the gauge invariant 2-form F is vanishing, and we do the approximation of Z7\u22121 \u223c 1 + 2c7 ln (r/\u039b) with \u039b = e1/\u01eb for large r, where we first employed the\nlarge r-approximation and then took \u01eb \u2192 0+ (the \"dimensional regularization\"), as can be\nunderstood from (2.28). Putting all the above results together, we have for the potential\n\u0002\n\u0003\nV = TD3 VD3 1 + c7 (sin \u03b81 \u2212 sin \u03b82 )2 ln(r/\u039b) .\n\n(2.30)\n\nThus we have again reproduced the logarithmic long range potential between the D3 and\nD7-brane. In the language of this subsection, the self-duality of the B-field, i.e B \u2212 = 0,\nimplies supersymmetry of this system. This was to be expected from the gauge invariance\nof F = F \u2212 B.\n\n3\n\nMinkowski vacuum: D3/D7 bound state\n\nThe attractive force leads the D3-brane towards D7-brane. When the critical distance (2.13)\nis reached (where a hypermultiplet scalar becomes massless), tachyon condensation brings the\nsystem of these branes into a bound state: D3-brane is dissolved on the worldvolume of the\nD7 brane. Supersymmetry is restored. In this section we describe this absolute ground state,\nshow that it has an unbroken supersymmetry and that the D-flatness condition is satisfied.\nIn our previous D4/D6 model [8] the picture of reconfigurated branes was suggested for the\nfinal state. In the present case, we are able to give a much more detailed and clear description\nof this state using the idea of a D3/D7 supersymmetric bound state which has an energy\nlower than that of D3 plus D7 when they are at a distance from each other.\nThe Higgs stage of D3/D7 cosmological model is closely related to the known descriptions\nof D0/D4 bound state in the framework of non-commutative gauge theory [23] as well as\nin string theory and Dirac-Born-Infeld theory [24]-[27]. The non-linear instantons of the\n\u03ba-symmetric branes in [25] were constructed in the context of flat Euclidean branes. In\nparticular, the most relevant case therein for our application is the Euclidean D3-brane\ninstanton. There is no need to use the approximation of a double scaling limit, as in [24, 25]\nto describe a D3/D7 bound state since we will employ the method to find solutions to the\nBPS equation for the non-linear instanton suggested in [27].\nThe setup is a D7-brane with normal Minkowski space signature in 0,1,2,3 directions\nand Euclidean signature in the four-dimensional space parameterized by 6,7,8,9, where the\nsupersymmetric non-linear instanton solution for the gauge field will be found in the presence\nof a constant, non-self-dual magnetic flux Fmn (Bmn ) field. If our Fmn (Bmn ) field is self-dual\nto start with, F \u2212 = 0 (B \u2212 = 0) there is no Coulomb branch or inflation in our model. It\n11\n\n\fwould be a limit in which all 3 FI terms vanish. So we will keep a constant F \u2212 6= 0 (B \u2212 6= 0)\nwhich nevertheless allows for a Higgs branch with unbroken supersymmetry.\n\n3.1\n\nD3/D7 bound state and unbroken \u03ba-symmetry\n\nIn the context of the \u03ba-symmetric D7-brane action (2.15), we will look for a D3/D7 supersymmetric bound state for fixed \u03b1\u2032 . We place our D7-brane in the background of the 10d\ntarget space, which is assumed to be flat Minkowski space with a non-vanishing constant\nBmn field in R4 with coordinates X m , m = 6, 7, 8, 9.\nThe equation for unbroken supersymmetry is \u0393\u01eb = \u01eb, where [17]\n\u0393 = e\u2212a i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nand\n\n1\na = Yik \u0393ik \u2297 \u03c3 3 .\n(3.2)\n2\nHere the matrix Y is a non-linear function of the matrix F . In the Coulomb phase, we\ncould choose a skew diagonal basis for F everywhere, since F was constant. In section 2 we\nchoose F67 = tan \u03b81 and F89 = tan \u03b82 leading to Y67 = \u03b81 and Y89 = \u03b82 . In the Higgs phase\nF is allowed to depend on the worldvolume coordinates; therefore F = F \u2212 B can not be\nbrought to a skew diagonal form everywhere. The worldvolume gauge field F is also assumed\nto vanish asymptotically.

However, in contrast to Coulomb phase, the\ndependence on \u03c3 can now be constrained in a way such that (3.6) has a solution.\n12\n\n\fThere are two possibilities to have unbroken supersymmetry. Choose the spinors in R4 to\nbe antichiral (chiral) and require that Y + (Y \u2212 ) does not depend on \u03c3, which in turn means\nthat Y \u00b1 (\u03c3) \u2212 (Y 0 )\u00b1 = 0,\n(1 \u00b1 \u03936789 )\u01eb = 0 ,\n\n\u2202Y \u00b1\n=0\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u0176 \u00b1 (\u03c3) = 0 .\n\nThe remaining condition on spinors is\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nik\n0 \u00b1\nexp \u2212 \u03c33 \u2297 \u0393 (Y )ik i\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 \u01eb = \u01eb .\n2\n\n(3.7)\n\n(3.8)\n\nNow we have to decide which of these solutions is the correct description of the Higgs\nbranch of our cosmological model. We can consider a limit in which there is no deformation\ndue to B. With antichiral (chiral) spinors in R4 we find the following supersymmetric\nconfiguration:\ni\u03c32 \u2297 \u03930123 \u01eb = \u2213\u01eb ,\n\ni\u03c32 \u2297 \u039301236789 \u01eb = \u01eb ,\n\nF\u00b1 = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis is a D\u03043 (D3) brane projector and a D7 brane projector, in the notation of [17].\nThus, our solution has chiral spinors in R4 . To have unbroken supersymmetry, in the\npresence of deformation B, requires that \u0176 \u2212 (\u03c3) = 0; this has an interpretation of a D3 \u0304 dissolved into a D7-brane. It can be shown, using (3.3) and (3.4), that\nbrane (and not a D3)\n\u0176 \u2212 (\u03c3) = 0 is equivalent to\n\u2212\n\u2212\nFik\nBik\n=\u2212\n.\n(3.10)\n1 + PfF\n1 + PfB\nEssentially the same BPS equation for the \u03ba-symmetric Euclidean D3-brane was derived in\n[25].\n\n3.2\n\nD3/D7 bound state and deformed instantons\n\nIn this section we shall discuss a solution of the BPS equation (3.10), that is, a slight\ngeneralization of the nonlinear instanton solution of Seiberg and Witten [24], without taking\ntheir double scaling limit. This problem was worked out by Moriyama in [27].

Now it is straightforward to solve this equation, following Seiberg and Witten\n[24]. First note that eq.

(3.11) will be given by\n\n14\n\n\fwhere we have defined\nR2 = \u03b4ab xa xb .\nThe function h(R) takes the form, as in [24] and [26],\n!\nr\n4CPf\u03b8\u2212\n1\n,\n1\u2212 1+\nh(R) = \u2212\nR4\n2Pf\u03b8 \u2212\n\n(3.24)\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere the constant C must be positive but otherwise arbitrary, as Pf\u03b8\u2212 is negative. Below,\nwe will take C to be \u22128N, with N being integer.\nIn the presence of the noncommutative parameter \u03b8\u2212 or equivalently the B \u2212 field, the\nsingularity of U(1) instanton is improved, as discussed in [24]. In particular the solution\n(3.23) has a finite instanton number, though the gauge potential itself is singular as we go\nto the UV:\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\nF \u2227 F = 2 d4 xPfF = \u2212 Pf\u03b8\u2212 lim R4 h2 = N .\n(3.26)\n2\nR\u21920\n16\u03c0 R4\n8\u03c0\n8\nNote that the final result does not depend on the value of \u03b8\u2212 , but it was crucial to keep \u03b8\u2212\nfinite in the procedure of getting finite instanton number. Had we taken the limit \u03b8\u2212 \u2192 0\nfirst, the instanton number would have been divergent, as h2 (R) grows as R\u22128 , as R goes to\nzero, which corresponds to the fact that there is no Abelian instanton with finite energy.\nIn our cosmological scenario, the nonvanishing \u03b8\u2212 is the seed of the inflation, giving\npositive vacuum energy and producing an instability. In particular our model realizes the\nslow-roll inflation, as discussed in the previous section. After the slow-roll inflationary stage,\nthe universe eventually goes through the tachyon condensation or 'waterfall stage', and ends\nup with the Minkowski vacuum. As we mentioned earlier, this endpoint vacuum is described\nby a non-marginal bound state of D3 and D7-branes that corresponds to the Higgs phase of\nthe gauge theory of the D3/D7 system with the FI term provided by the nonvanishing \u03b8\u2212 .\nIt is quite well-known that the D3-branes on the D7-branes can be thought of as instantons\non the D7-branes due to the Chern-Simons coupling,\nZ\nZ\n1\nC4 \u2227 F \u2227 F = N\nC4 .\n(3.27)\nSCS =\n16\u03c0 2 D7\nD3\n\nIn the above we have presented a D7-brane probe approximation of the Higgs phase where\nthe D3-brane is described by a nonlinear or deformed instanton on the U(1) DBI theory on\nthe D7-brane.\nHowever, given the fact that the Higgs phase of this D3/D7 system is actually identical to\nthe noncommutative generalization of the ADHM construction of instantons, one may make\na step further and argue that our Minkowski vacuum is described by the noncommutative\ninstanton of Nekrasov and Schwarz [23], improving the nonlinear instanton solution that we\nhave studied above. The noncommutative instanton solution is non-singular even at R = 0,\nresolving the singularity of the zero-size instantons, and the action is of course finite.\n15\n\n\fIt is to be stressed that we have thus found a possible connection of the cosmological\n'constant' in spacetime (0123-space) and the noncommutativity in internal space (6789space):\n\u039b (spacetime cosmological constant)\n\n\u21d4\n\n\u03b8\u2212 (noncommutativity in internal space).\n\nWe have generated the cosmological constant by turning on B \u2212 or equivalently \u03b8 \u2212 , which can\neventually be interpreted as the noncommutative parameter in the internal space at the end\nof our cosmological evolution, the Higgs phase, of our D3/D7 model. Also it may be somewhat suggestive that the non-vanishing non-commutativity parameter, i.e. the cosmological\nconstant, serves, in a way, to resolve the singularity at the end of inflation.\n\n4\n\nA compactified type IIB setup\n\nIn section 2 we studied a system of separated D3/D7 with world-volume two-form fluxes\nsuch that there is no supersymmetry. This was the Coulomb phase of our model. Because\nof spontaneously broken supersymmetry the D3-brane would be attracted towards the D7\nand eventually it would fall into the D7 as an instanton. Due to the presence of fluxes (as\nFI term) the instanton \u2212 which is the dissolved D3 \u2212 will behave as a non-commutative\ninstanton. The point like singularity of the instanton is therefore resolved. This is the Higgs\nphase studied in section 3 and now it is supersymmetric. Given such a setup, there are two\ninteresting questions that we can ask at this stage:\n(i) Is it possible to get a compactified four-dimensional model for this setup? We would then\nneed to compactify our type IIB model on a six-dimensional base. But this raises the problem\nof anomalies or equivalently charge conservation. Therefore what we need is a configuration\nin four dimensions which is anomaly free.\n(ii) Is it possible to study the metric for the system for both the Coulomb and the Higgs\nphase? In the Coulomb phase we expect the metric to have an inherent time dependence. In\nthe Higgs phase \u2212 now because of supersymmetry \u2212 we expect a time independent metric.\nIn this section we shall see that both these questions can be partially answered from a\ntype IIB setup involving both branes and orientifold planes. In section 5 we describe its\nM-theory lift.\n\n4.1\n\nThe model\n\nTo get a model in four dimensions we have to compactify our D3/D7 system on a six dimensional space. The branes are oriented as in Table 1. Therefore we need to compactify\ndirections x4,5,6,7,8,9 , which raises the question of charge conservation. Both the D3 and the\nD7 branes are points on the compact two space x4,5 . Therefore to cancel the charges of the\nbranes we have to put negatively charged objects in our model. These have to be orientifold planes, since anti-branes would annihilate with the branes destroying the dynamics.\n16\n\n\fHowever in string theory an orientifold operation is an elaborate mechanism which requires\nvarious other branes and planes to get a completely consistent picture. We now describe one\nconsistent setup which satisfies all the requirements of a compact model.\nThe model that we take to get a compactified type IIB setup has been studied earlier\nin a different context for supersymmetric cases. This involves compactifying type IIB on\nK3 \u00d7 T 2 /Z2 where the Z2 is an orientifold operation:\nZ2 = \u03a9 * (\u22121)FL * I45 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe torus T 2 is oriented along x4 , x5 ; I45 is the orbifold projection with the action x4,5 \u2192\n\u2212x4,5 ; \u03a9 is the worldsheet orientation reversal and (\u22121)FL changes the sign of the left moving\nspace-time fermions. The K3 is oriented along x6,7,8,9 . Under the \u03a9 * (\u22121)FL operation the\nvarious fields of type IIB change as:\n\ngM N\nNS\nBM\nN\nRR\nBM N\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\u0303\nD+\n\n\u03a9 (\u22121)FL\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u03a9 * (\u22121)FL\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\nTable 3\nTaking further into account I45 , we see from the above table that B fields along x6,7,8,9\ndirections are projected out. The only B fields that survive must have one leg along x4,5 .\nThese appear as gauge fields in four-dimensions or as scalars. Other fields which have one\nleg either along x4 or x5 are also removed from the spectrum. For example if we denote\nm, n = x4,5 ,\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = x6,7,8,9 ,\n\n\u03bc, \u03bd = x0,1,2,3 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nthen reducing over T 2 /Z2 we have, in addition to a metric g\u03bc\u03bd , the following spectrum of\nscalars and vectors from the supergravity fields (in terms of four dimensional multiplets):\ngM N\nN S,RR\nBM\nN\n\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303\n+\nDM\nNP Q\n\nScalars\ngmn , g\u03b1\u03b2\nN S,RR\nBm\u03b1\n\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303\n+\n+\n+\nDmn\u03b1\u03b2 , D0123\n, D\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\nTable 4\n\n17\n\nVectors\ng\u03b1\u03bc\nN S,RR\nBm\u03bc\n\u2212\n+\nD\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03bc\n\n\fHowever K3 further cuts down the spectrum as the first Betti number is zero (so that no one\n+\nN S,RR\nforms can exist). In particular it kills g\u03b1\u03bc , Bm\u03b1\nand D\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03bc\n. It also restricts the number\nof two forms on it to be\nb2 = b11 + 2b20 = 22 ,\n(4.3)\ncorresponding to the number of four dimensional scalars from the metric. This is the supersymmetric spectrum of the model. This spectrum is, as we know, incomplete. The complete\nspectrum involves additional 16 D7-branes as 4 O7-planes. The O7-planes are located at the\nfour orbifold singularities of T 2 /I45 . To cancel charges locally we need 4 D7 branes on top\nof each orientifold planes. Therefore we have 7 branes wrapping the K3. This is a familiar\nmodel in the F-theory context. As discussed in [19] the axion-dilaton is constant and could\nbe arbitrary.7\n4.1.1\n\nThe orbifold limit\n\nNaively from the supergravity point of view it is difficult to argue the existence of the\ntetrahedron T 2 /I45 since the total source is zero at the orbifold point. However, perturbative\nstring theory 'feels' it. Thus, a D3-brane feels the orientifold background, even if both\ncharge and tension are cancelled by the presence of both orientifolds and D-branes.8 Let us\nconcentrate on one bunch of 4 D7 + O7. The gauge theory on the D3 is a Sp(1) \u2261 SU(2)\nSeiberg-Witten theory with 8 supercharges whose matter hypermultiplets are given by the\nD3/D7 strings. The strings which go around the O7-plane and come back give the massive\nW \u00b1 bosons charged under the U(1) gauge multiplets (the string starting from and ending\non the D3).\nThe location of the D3-brane in the x4,5 corresponds to the expectation value of the\ncomplex chiral field in the adjoint of SU(2) \u2212 this is the inflaton field in our model \u2212 which\nbelongs to the vector multiplet. Denoting this as \u03a6 = x4 + ix5 we can diagonalise this to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd 0\n\u03a6=\n.\n(4.4)\n0 \u2212d\nThe classical massless point is d = 0 and the W \u00b1 have masses 2d.\nThere are also strings which start from and end on the D7-branes. They give rise to the\nSO(8) gauge fields on the D7-branes. These strings survive the orientifold projection because\nthe vertex operators are neutral under \u03a9-projections. However there could be strings which\nstart from a D7, cross an O7 and come back to the D7. For these strings \u03a9-projections\nremove the first massless vector multiplets charged under SO(8). The surviving states are\nthe next stringy oscillations which are massive and non-BPS [29].\n7\n\nThere are however some special points in the constant coupling moduli space where the seven branes\nare distributed in some specific way which gives rise to exceptional global symmetry on the four-dimensional\ngauge theory [28]. These points are at strong coupling. We ignore these subtleties because they will not\naffect the result.\n8\nAt this point putting a probe looks arbitrary and it seems like we have not cancelled its charge on the\ncompact space. In the next section we shall argue the consistency of this from the M-theory point of view.\n\n18\n\n\fThe Coulomb branch of our model is when we switch on gauge flux F on the seven branes.\nAs discussed earlier this flux is non-primitive i.e non-self dual. This breaks supersymmetry\nspontaneously and therefore the D3 probe would be attracted towards the D7. This motion\ncreates an instability in the system which triggers off non-perturbative corrections on the\nbackground.\n4.1.2\n\nAway from orbifold limit\n\nUnder non-perturbative corrections each O7-plane splits into two (p, q) seven branes (where\n(p, q) seven branes are defined as branes on which (p, q) strings can end \u2212 p, q denoting the\ntwo background values of B fields). In a theory with 16 bulk supercharges this is explicitly\ndemonstrated in [19, 20]. We expect something similar for our case too. However our main\nconcern is to study an isolated and compactified D3/D7 system. This can be achieved by\npulling a D7 from the bunch and study its dynamics in the presence of a probe D3-brane.\nThis way we can isolate the other O7 \u2212 D7 dynamics from our inflationary model.\nOur last concern is the anomaly cancellation. For the SUSY setup of our model (with\nself-dual F ) the argument of anomaly cancellation is simple. Let us make two T-dualities\nalong directions x4,5 of the torus T 2 . Under this\n\u03a9 * (\u22121)FL * I45 \u2192 \u03a9\n\n(4.5)\n\nThis is now type I theory on a torus which is further dual to heterotic string on a torus. As\nwe know all anomalies \u2212 gauge and gravity \u2212 are cancelled for this theory and therefore we\nexpect the same for type IIB background.\nIn our case however the background is non-supersymmetric and hence T-dualities are\nsubtle. So anomaly cancellation has to be checked by explicitly doing the one loop graph\nfor the given background. However as we shall discuss in the ensuing section, anomaly\ncancellation can be equated in this case to charge cancellation on a compact manifold in\nM-theory. For this case therefore we can argue that anomalies do get cancelled.\nBefore we end this section let us summarise the situation. First, the full matter content\nof our theory:\n(1) Gauge fields on D3-brane: These are the SU(2) gauge fields broken to U(1) at any\ngeneric point of our model. In fact there is never an enhancement to SU(2) in this setup, so\nit remains U(1) all through [30, 31, 19, 20]. If we take large number of D3-branes then the\nsituation can be more subtle.\n(2) Gauge fields on the D7-branes: These are the SO(8) gauge fields on the seven branes.\nIn our case we have switched on a background U(1) field on one of the D7 which breaks\nsupersymmetry in our model. This field, F , acts as an FI term in the D3 worldvolume\ntheory.\n(3) Massive hypermultiplets: These are generated by 3 \u2212 7 strings which survive the \u03a9projections. In general they are massive.\n\n19\n\n\f(4) Bulk modes: These come from the bulk supergravity modes. Under \u03a9-projection many\nof the bulk fields are removed from the spectrum as discussed above. The surviving ones\nundergo further projection due to the K3 manifold. In the end we get a metric, scalars and\nvectors in four dimensions. These vectors are in addition to the SO(8) and the U(1) vectors\nof the D7 and D3 respectively.\n(5) Stable non-BPS states: These are actually the modes that survive \u03a9-projection on the\nD7-branes coming from the 7-7 strings that go around the O-plane. They are all massive\nand receive sizable quantum correction.\n(6) Modes on O-planes: They are non existent when we neglect non-perturbative corrections.\nHowever in our model we expect the corrections to be sizable as we have isolated a D7 from\nthe rest of the dynamics. Therefore the O-planes no longer remain non-dynamical. Now\n(p, q) strings can end on them and therefore they support matter fields.\n(7) Junctions and networks: Additional states can also arise in our setup. A D7 can be\nconnected to two different (p, q) seven branes via a junction or a string network. They\ncontribute additional states. But these are in general massive, so we can neglect them.\nFrom the above analysis we see that most of the other matter fields coming from branes\nand planes are actually massive, and in the limit when we separate one D7 from the whole\ncrowd, we can in principle study a compactified theory with few massless matter fields\n(including gravity). This is what we have tried to achieve here.\n\n5\n\nM-theory on a four-fold with G-fluxes\n\nThe above setup can be further simplified by lifting it to M-theory. All the complicacies of\nbranes and planes now disappear in M-theory. The system of 16D7 + 4O7 located at four\npoints of T 2 /I45 in IIB simply becomes a T 4 /Z2 orbifold of K3 in M-theory. In other words\nthe whole setup in IIB is actually just M-theory compactified on T 4 /Z2 \u00d7 K3! Denoting the\nT 4 directions as x3,10,4,5 the Z2 operation sends (notice this is distinct from the Z2 of section\n4):\nZ2\nx3,10,4,5 \u2212\u2192\n\u2212 x3,10,4,5 .\n(5.6)\nThe original positions of the branes and planes become orbifold singularities in M-theory.\nThe non-supersymmetric flux on one of the seven branes in type IIB becomes localized G-flux\nnear one of the orbifold singularities. Supersymmetry is broken by choosing a non-primitive\nG-flux. Before we go into the details of the M-theory setup let us summarise the situation\nin the following table:\n\n20\n\n\fType IIB\nT /(\u03a9 * (\u22121)FL * Z2 ) \u00d7 K3\n4(O7 + 4 D7)\nD3\nF on D7\nCoulomb phase\nHiggs phase\nAway from orientifold limit\n2\n\nM \u2212 theory\nT 4 /Z2 \u00d7 K3\n4 orbifold fixed points\nM2\nLocalised G-flux at fixed-points\nNon-primitive G-flux\nPrimitive G-flux\n4\nT /Z2 \u2192 Smooth K3\n\nTable 5\nThe model that we are going to use is M-theory compactified on a four-fold with G-fluxes\nswitched on. To get a N = 2 theory we have to compactify M-theory on K3 \u00d7 K3. We shall\ntake one of the K3 to be a torus fibration over a CP 1 base (see figure 2). The Weierstrass\nequation governing the background is given by\ny 2 = x3 + xf (z) + g(z) ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere x, y, z \u2208 CP 1 , f (z) is a polynomial of degree eight, and g(z) is a polynomial of degree\n12 in z. As a concrete example let us consider [19]\ng(z) =\n\n4\nY\n(z \u2212 zi )3 ,\n\nf (z) = a\n\n4\nY\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n(z \u2212 zi )2 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere a is a constant. This basically describes a torus at every point of CP 1 labelled by\nthe coordinate z. The modular parameter \u03c4 (z) of the torus is determined in terms of f 3 /g 2\nthrough the relation\nj(\u03c4 ) =\n\n4.(24f )3\n55296a3\n(\u03b818 (\u03c4 ) + \u03b828 (\u03c4 ) + \u03b838 (\u03c4 ))3\n=\n=\n.\n\u03b7(\u03c4 )24\n27g 2 + 4f 3\n27 + 4a3\n\n(5.9)\n\nThe number of points at which the torus degenerates is given in terms of the zeroes of the\npolynomial\n\u2206 \u2261 4f 3 + 27g 2 .\n(5.10)\nIn terms of our choice of f and g the number of points at which the torus degenerates is\ngiven as:\n4\nY\n3\n\u2206 = (4a + 27) (z \u2212 zi )6 = 0 .\n(5.11)\ni=1\n\nTo go to type IIB theory we have to shrink the fiber torus to zero size. Let us study\nthis decomposition carefully. We first denote the base K3 by coordinates x6,7,8,9 and the\nother K3 by x4,5,3,10 in M-theory. The spacetime is x0,1,2 . In type IIB therefore we get 16D7\nand 4O7 planes located at points on a CP 1 along directions x4,5 . These branes and planes\n21\n\n\fT2\n\n(x3 , x10 )\n\nK3\nCP 1\n\n(x4 , x5 )\n\n(x6 , x7 , x8 , x9 )\n\nK3\n\nFigure 2: The \"snowman\" fibration of the K3 \u00d7 K3 four-fold. The crosses indicate points\non the CP 1 basis at which the fibre tori degenerate. In the orbifold limit of the 'top' K3\nthere will be four such points.\nwrap the other K3 along x6,..,9. The spacetime is now four dimensional: x0,1,2,3 . From our\nchoice of f, g the K3 is elliptically fibered and therefore the CP 1 base in IIB is given by\nT 2 /(\u22121)FL * \u03a9 * I45 where \u03a9 is the orientifold operation, (\u22121)FL changes the sign of the left\nmoving fermions and I45 : x4,5 \u2192 \u2212x4,5 .\nTo verify the above analysis one can make a further T-duality along, say, x3 . Using the\nfact that [32]\nT3\n\u03a9 in IIB \u2212\u2192\nI3 \u03a9 in IIA\n(5.12)\nwe can show that IIA theory is now on\nT3\n(\u22121)FL * \u03a9 * I345\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis however is dual to M-theory on K3 [33] thus proving our result.\nEquation (5.8) describes the orbifold limit of K3. We assume this is the initial stage of our\ndynamical process. In terms of type IIB language, we place a D3-brane at the center of mass\nof the 4 \u00d7(4D7/O7) setup on one side of the \"pillow\" T 2 /Z2 and another on its diametrically\nopposite side, as in figure 3. We turn on the same gauge fluxes on all of the four fixed points.\nThe logarithmic potential of section 2 creates a force between each pair of D3 and D7\nbranes, if we assume the size of the T 2 /Z2 to be large enough. However in this configuration\nthe total force between D3 and D7 branes is balanced, and the logarithmic potential being\napproximately flat leads to a nearly de Sitter evolution. Quantum fluctuations will destabilize\nthe system allowing both the D3-brane to move towards some D7-brane and the D7-branes\nto move away from the orbifold fixed points. This is the beginning of the Coulomb phase\nor equivalently the inflationary stage (figure 4). As the system starts evolving we do not\nexpect the coupling to remain constant anymore. The whole system moves away from the\norientifold limit, which in M-theory language means we have a generic K3. Finally, we expect\n22\n\n\fthe D3 to fall into one particular D7-brane as a non-commutative instanton as explained in\nsection 3. This is the supersymmetric configuration that has been studied in M-theory and\nwhich we now describe.\n\n: 4D7/O7\n: D3\n: D3'\n\nFigure 3: The initial brane configuration on the \"pillow\" T 2 /Z2 .\n\nSingle D3\u2212D7 system\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n(p,q)7\u2212branes\nD3\nD7\u2212branes\nD3'\n\nFigure 4: The Coulomb branch. As the system is driven away from the unstable point of\nfigure 2, T 2 /Z2 \u2192 CP 1 , the orientifold planes split into (p, q) 7-branes, and the D3-brane\nwill eventually fall into one D7-brane as an instanton.\n\n5.1\n\nSupersymmetric setup: Higgs phase\n\nLet us first summarise the known properties of the fourfold that allows for a supersymmetric\nconfiguration:\n\u2022 The 4-fold vacua has a tadpole anomaly given by \u03c7/24 where \u03c7 is the Euler characteristics of the 4-fold. If \u03c7/24 is integral, then the anomaly can be cancelled by placing a\n23\n\n\fsufficient number of spacetime filling M2-branes n on points of the compactification manifold. There is also another way of cancelling the anomaly and this is through G-flux. The\nR\nG-flux contributes a C tadpole through the Chern-Simons coupling C \u2227 G \u2227 G. When \u03c7/24\nis not integral then we need both the branes and the G-flux to cancel the anomaly. The\nanomaly cancellation formula becomes\nZ\n1\n\u03c7\n= 2 G\u2227G+n ,\n(5.14)\n24\n8\u03c0\nwhich must be satisfied for type IIA or M-theory.\n\u2022 If we denote the spacetime coordinates by x\u03bc where \u03bc = 0, 1, 2 and the internal space\nby the complex coordinates y a , a = 1, .., 4 then in the presence of G-flux the metric becomes\na warped one\n(5.15)\nds2 = e\u2212\u03c6(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e\u03c6(y)/2 gab\u0304 dy a dy b\u0304 ,\nwith the G-flux satisfying the condition\nG = \u2217G,\n\nJ \u2227G=0 ,\n\n(5.16)\n\nwhere the Hodge star acts on the internal 4-fold with metric g and J is the Kahler form\nof the 4-fold. There is also another non-vanishing G given in terms of the warp factor as\nG\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1a = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202a e\u22123\u03c6/2 . The warp factor satisfies the equation\n\"\n#\nn\nX\n1\n\u2206e3\u03c6/2 = \u2217 4\u03c0 2 X8 \u2212 G \u2227 G \u2212 4\u03c0 2\n\u03b4 8 (y \u2212 yi ) ,\n(5.17)\n2\ni=1\nwhere the Laplacian and the Hodge * is defined with respect to g, and X8 is an eight-form\nconstructed out from curvature tensors given in (5.31).\nThe G-flux can now decompose in two ways to give different supersymmetric backgrounds\nin type IIB. Let us choose the following basis of one-forms for the fiber torus (with modular\nparameter \u03c4 ) [34].\ndz = dx + \u03c4 dy ,\ndz\u0304 = dx + \u03c4\u0304 dy .\n(5.18)\nIn terms of spacetime coordinates the directions y, x are x3 , x10 . The CP 1 base has coordinates x4 , x5 and the other K3 is oriented along x6,7,8,9 . The \"flat\" directions are x0,1,2,3 .\nDecomposing G-flux as\nG\n= dz \u2227 \u03c9 \u2212 dz\u0304 \u2227 \u2217\u03c9 ,\n(5.19)\n2\u03c0\nwhere \u03c9 has one leg along CP 1 and two along K3, we get in type IIB the following three\nforms:\nHN S = \u03c9 \u2212 \u2217\u03c9,\nHRR = \u03c9\u03c4 \u2212 \u2217\u03c9\u03c4\u0304 .\n(5.20)\nThe anomaly cancellation condition will now become, in type IIB theory\nZ\n\u03c7\n= n + HRR \u2227 HN SN S ,\n24\n24\n\n(5.21)\n\n\fwhere n is the number of D3 branes.\nWe can also decompose G-fluxes as:\nk\n\nX\nG\n=\nFi \u2227 \u03a9i ,\n2\u03c0\ni=1\n\n(5.22)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2..k are the number of points at which the fiber torus degenerates, and \u03a9i\nare the normalisable harmonic forms localized at the singularities. The physical significance\nof Fi are the gauge fields that would appear on the 7-branes when we go to type IIB by\nshrinking the fiber torus. The fact that locally a K3 looks like a Taub-NUT space implies\nthat there exist a harmonic two form which is anti-self-dual and normalisable. It is not\ndifficult to identify the harmonic two forms with \u03a9i . The anomaly cancellation condition or\nequivalently the warp factor equation will now become in type IIB theory:\n\u2206e3\u03c6/2 = \u2217B\n\nk\nX\n[Fi \u2227 Fi + tr(R \u2227 R)]\u03b4 2 (z \u2212 zi ) ,\n\n(5.23)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere zi are the positions of the seven branes.\nHence the general G-flux background will be\nX\nG\n=\nFi \u2227 \u03a9i + dz \u2227 \u03c91 + dz\u0304 \u2227 \u03c92 ,\n2\u03c0\ni\n\n(5.24)\n\nwhere i denotes the number of singularities or equivalently number of seven branes (in IIB).\nThe self-duality of G flux does not imply F to be self dual. This is the precise condition\nfor the existence of non-commutative instanton.\nSince the background is supersymmetric we now expect the metric to be given by the\nanalysis of [35, 36]. The metric has the form of a D3 brane metric and the cosmological\nconstant vanishes.\n\n5.2\n\nCoulomb Phase\n\nAs discussed in [36] a (2, 2) G-flux background is non-supersymmetric if the G-flux does not\nsatisfy the primitivity condition i.e we require\ng ab\u0304 Gab\u0304cd \u0304 6= 0 .\n\n(5.25)\n\nTherefore let us choose a generic background for the G-flux as:\nG\n= dz \u2227 \u03c9\u03031 + dz\u0304 \u2227 \u03c9\u03032 .\n(5.26)\n2\u03c0\nWe do not impose any conditions on \u03c9\u03031,2 as g ab\u0304 Gab\u0304cd \u0304 6= 0. The number n of D3-branes can\nbe tuned by choosing some appropriate values for \u03c9\u03031,2 satisfying\nZ\nn = 24 \u2212 (\u03c9\u03031 + \u03c9\u03032 ) \u2227 (\u03c4 \u03c9\u03031 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 \u03c9\u03032 ) .\n(5.27)\n\nSince the system is not supersymmetric we expect the D3 to be moving towards the seven\nbranes. And therefore the metric ansatz cannot be a static one as in [35, 36].\n25\n\n\f5.3\n\nHigher order corrections\n\nBefore we end this section let us make some remarks on higher order corrections in eleven\ndimensional supergravity which were briefly alluded to in the earlier sections. In our model\nthere are two different sources of higher order corrections [37]:\n(1) Curvature corrections: In the M-theory metric the higher curvature corrections come\nfrom the following terms in the eleven dimensional lagrangian:\nZ\nZ\nh\n1 i\n11 \u221a\n(5.28)\nd x \u2212g J0 \u2212 E8 \u2212 C \u2227 X8 .\n2\nThe various terms appearing in the above equation are defined as:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nJ0 = 3 * 28 RM N P Q RRN P S RMT U R RS T U Q + RM N P Q RRSP Q RMT U R RS T U N + O(RM N ) ,\n2\n(5.29)\n1 ABCN1 ...N8\nM1 M2\nM7 M8\nE8 = \u01eb\n\u01ebABCM1 ...M8 R\n(5.30)\nN1 N2 ...R\nN7 N8 ,\n3!\nh\ni\n1\n1\n4\n2 2\ntr\nR\n\u2212\n(tr\nR\n)\n.\n(5.31)\nX8 =\n3 * 210 * \u03c0 4\n4\nNow assuming that our warp factor is everywhere smooth, then integrating out (5.17) we\nhave the required anomaly cancellation equation for the four-fold. However if we put X8 = 0\nthen observe that there could be no non-trivial background fluxes in the model. The only\nconsistent solution then is to take G = 0 and n = 0. This is the key issue which we think is\nimportant to have the required background.\nAnother point which follows immediately is that since J0 and E8 are of the same form\n(and order) as X8 it will be inconsistent to neglect them and consider only X8 . Therefore to\nhave a consistent picture in the presence of branes and planes we cannot neglect higher order\ncurvature terms. Also, this is a possible way to go around the no-go theorems of Gibbons\n[38] and Maldacena and Nu\u00f1ez [39].\n(2) G-flux corrections: In our model G-flux could also contribute higher order corrections.\nThese corrections have not been worked out in any detail. However they are believed to be\nof the general form\nX\n\u221a\n(5.32)\n\u03b1mnp \u2212g (\u2202G)m Gn Rp ,\nm,n,p\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03b1mnp are not known in general9 . As long as we take the background G\nfluxes to be smooth and small we can in principle neglect these correction. For sharply\nvarying G-fluxes, however, there could be sizable corrections which may destabilize the\nbackground.\n9\n\nFor some special cases when n = p = 0 and m = 4 they are calculated in [40].\n\n26\n\n\f6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our paper the main emphasis was on the derivation of the gauge theory with the particular\npotential and FI terms from type IIB string theory. When this gauge theory is coupled to\ngravity in four dimension it leads to hybrid inflation. As briefly discussed in sections 4 and\n5 we expect the configuration of D7-branes and O7-planes in the presence of D3-branes (at\nthe equilibrium points on the \"pillow\") will lead to a dS4 space as the beginning of inflation.\nQuantum fluctuation will trigger off inflation in this system.\nThe Coulomb phase of the cosmological D3/D7 setup describes a period of slow- roll\ninflation in de Sitter valley and in the Higgs phase describes a supersymmetric ground state\nwith vanishing cosmological constant. As discussed in the text, there is a compactified\npicture in M-theory on K3 \u00d7 K3 manifold with a choice of G-flux on it. When the flux is\nnon-primitive the background is non-supersymmetric and when the background is primitive,\nsupersymmetry is restored. We believe the various moduli in this setup may be fixed by the\nchoice of G-flux and higher derivative corrections described in section 5 [41, 36]. We will\nleave this problem for future work.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe benefited from discussions with K. Becker, D. Freedman, G. Gibbons, S. Kachru, N.\nKaloper, L. Kofman, A. Linde, A. Peet, M. M.
