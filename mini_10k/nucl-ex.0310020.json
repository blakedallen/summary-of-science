Introduction\nElectromagnetic interactions between relativistic heavy ions occur frequently, even at impact\nparameters b large enough that no hadronic interactions occur [1]. The electromagnetic fields may\nbe treated as fields of almost-real photons, following the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams method; the photon\nflux scales as Z 2 , so the cross sections are large.\nThese ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) can be\ndivided into two classes, purely electromagnetic\ninteractions (two-photon) and photonuclear interactions, where a photon from the field of one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus. We focus\non the region b > 2RA to exclude hadronic contamination. We will present 3 topics which have\nbeen studied by the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC\n(STAR) collaboration: vector meson production,\nvector meson interferometry, and e+ e\u2212 pair production.\nVector mesons are produced when a photon\nfrom the field of one nucleus fluctuates to a qq\npair (virtual vector meson), which then scatters\nelastically from the other nucleus, emerging as a\nvector meson [2], as is shown in Fig. 1a. The elastic scattering is colorless, and can be described in\nterms of Pomeron exchange. For light mesons\nlike the \u03c10 , the cross section rises slowly with the\nphoton energy k. For small momentum transfers,\nthe elastic scattering is coherent over the entire\nnuclear target. In the coherent region, the cross\n\nsection depends on the size of the qq dipole fluctuation.\nHeavy mesons come from small dipoles with\nsmall interaction cross sections. Production is\ndistributed evenly throughout the target, and\n\u03c3 \u2248 A2 . For sufficiently heavy mesons like the\nJ/\u03c8, the elastic scattering may be described in\nterms of multiple gluon exchange. The cross section is sensitive to gluon shadowing in nuclei [3].\nLarge dipoles (light mesons) interact with a\nlarge cross section with the first nucleon that they\nencounter. The interaction is on the surface of the\ntarget, so \u03c3 \u2248 A4/3 . The exact scaling can be determined by a Glauber calculation [4,5]; for the\n\u03c10 , the scaling is roughly A5/3 .\nThe large photon flux and the coherent scattering lead to a large cross section for \u03c10 production. For 200 GeV per nucleon Au-Au collisions at RHIC, the cross section for \u03c10 production is 590 mb, or about 8% of the hadronic cross\nsection [4]. The STAR collaboration has already\npublished results on \u03c10 production in Au-Au collisions at an energy of 130 GeV per nucleon [6].\nThe cross sections agreed with the Glauber calculations.\nThe elastic scattering involves the strong force,\nand so has a very short range [7]. The \u03c1 production is localized to within 1 fm of the two ions.\nThere are two possibilities: either nucleus 1 emits\na photon which scatters off nucleus 2, or vice\nversa. These two possibilities are indistinguish-\n\n\f2\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\u03c10\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nA*\nA*\n\nA\n\nA\n\u03c10\n\nA\nA*\n\nA\nA*\nd)\n\nc)\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagrams for (a) \u03c10 production and (b) e+ e\u2212 production. These processes\nmay be accompanied by mutual Coulomb excitation, as in (c) and (d) respectively. The dashed\nlines in (c) and (d) show the factorization, Eq. 3.\n\nable, and are related by a parity tranformation.\nVector mesons have negative parity, so the two\namplitudes subtract, with a transverse momentum (pT ) dependent phase factor to account for\nthe separation. The cross section is [8]\n\u03c3 = A1 \u2212 A2 exp (ipT * b)\n\n2\n\n(1)\n0\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are the amplitudes for \u03c1 production from the two directions. At mid-rapidity\nA1 = A2 and this simplifies to\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 (1 \u2212 cos (pT * b)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c30 is the cross section without interference.\nThe system acts as a 2-slit interferometer, with\nslit separation b [9]. Of course, b is unmeasurable, and the observed pT spectrum is obtained\nby integrating Eq. (1) over b. The pT spectrum\nis suppressed for pT < h\u0304/hbi, where hbi is the\nmedian impact parameter.\nThe \u03c1 decay distance, \u03b3\u03b2c\u03c4 < 1 fm is far less\nthan hbi \u2248 46 fm. The \u03c10 decay before the two\n\namplitudes can overlap, making this an interesting test of quantum mechanics [10].\nTwo-photon processes like e+ e\u2212 , Fig. 1b production are purely electromagnetic. To lowest order, it involves 2 photons, so the cross section\nscales as Z 4 . At RHIC, the cross section is expected to be huge - 33,000 barns for gold beams.\nThe coupling constant Z\u03b1 \u2248 0.6 is large, so perturbative descriptions of this process may not be\nadequate. The calculated Coulomb corrections to\nthe lowest order diagram reduce the cross section\nby 25% [11]. However, recent all-orders calculations find a cross section that matches the lowest\norder result [12]. The apparent discrepancy is not\nwell understood [13].\nIn UPCs, the coupling constant Z\u03b1 (where \u03b1 \u2248\n1/137 is the electromagnetic coupling constant) is\nvery large, so multiple interactions between a single ion pair are common. \u03c10 or e+ e\u2212 production\nmay be accompanied by mutual Coulomb excitation, as in Figs. 1c and 1d. Each ion emits a\nphoton, which excites the other nucleus, usually\nto a giant dipole resonance (GDR). The excited\nnucleus decays by emitting one or more neutrons.\nThese neutrons serve as a distinctive experimental signature of nuclear dissociation. The presence of mutual Coulomb dissociation can be used\nto 'tag' collisions at moderate impact parameters,\n2RA < b <\u2248 30 fm [14]. Except for the shared\nimpact parameter, the reactions are independent\n[15]. For example, the cross section for \u03c10 production with mutual Coulomb dissociation is\n\u03c3=\n\nZ\n\nd2 bP\u03c1 (b)P2EXC (b)[1 \u2212 Phad (b)]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere P\u03c1 (b) and P2EXC (b) are the probabilities\nfor \u03c10 production and mutual excitation respectively. Here, Phad (b) is the probability of having\na hadronic interaction; the last term has an effect\nsimilar to setting a minimum impact parameter\nbmin = 2RA . For gold ions, P\u03c1 (2RA ) \u2248 1% and\nP2EXC (2RA ) \u2248 30%, so the probability of multiple interactions is substantial. The multiple photon exchange skews these interactions to smaller\nb. This leads to a harder photon spectrum, and\nas can be seen from Eq. (2), interference at larger\npT .\n\n\f3\n2. The STAR Detector\nThe STAR detector studies heavy ion and polarized proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National\nLaboratory. STAR is optimized to study central heavy ion collisions, which may contain thousands of particles [16]. However, it is also quite\neffective for studying UPCs where the final states\ncontain 2-4 particles. STAR has collected UPC\ndata in gold-gold collisions at energies of 130 GeV\nper nucleon (in 2000) and 200 GeV per nucleon\n(in 2001). STAR has also studied \u03c10 photoproduction in 200 GeV per nucleon deuteron on gold\ncollisions [17]. In dA collisions, the photon usually comes from the gold nucleus, removing the\nphoton direction ambiguity present in the goldgold collisions. This writeup will focus on the\n200 GeV per nucleon gold-gold collisions.\nCharged particles are reconstructed in a 4.2\nmeter long, 4 meter diameter time projection\nchamber (TPC) [18]. The TPC is in a solenoidal\nmagnetic field which has been operated at both\n0.25 and 0.5 T. At 0.5 T, the reconstruction efficiency for charged pions is high for tracks with\ntransverse momentum pT > 100 MeV/c and\npseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.15. The track position\nand specific energy loss, dE/dx were measured\nat 45 points for high momentum charged particles with |\u03b7| < 1. In a 0.5 T field, the dE/dx\nresolution was 8%. The TPC is surrounded by\n240 scintillator slats covering |\u03b7| < 1, comprising\nthe central trigger barrel (CTB). Two zero degree\ncalorimeters (ZDCs) are located 18 m upstream\nand downstream of the interaction point. These\ncalorimeters are sensitive to neutrons from mutual Coulomb dissociation [19].\nTwo different triggers [20] were used to study\nUPCs. The 'topology' trigger selected events with\nan appropriate topology in the CTB. It divided\nthe CTB into 4 quadrants: north, south, top and\nbottom, and required hits in the north and south\nquadrants. The top and bottom regions were used\nas vetoes to reject cosmic rays.\nThe minimum bias trigger selected events with\none or more neutrons in each ZDC. The ZDC signals were required to occur within 1 nsec, restricting these events to the central 30 cm of the TPC.\n\nData from both triggers was processed identically, except that events from the CTB based\ntrigger were distributed more broadly along the\nTPC axis, and consequently, were accepted in a\nbroader range.\n3. \u03c10 Production\nUPC \u03c10 production has a distinctive signature two oppositely charged tracks with small net pT .\nWe select events with exactly 2 primary tracks\nthat form a vertex. The vertexing procedure considers all of the tracks in an event, and rejects\ntracks that are inconsistent with coming from a\nsingle vertex. We do allow a few non-primary\nbackground tracks in the TPC. The topology and\nminimum bias data were treated identically, except that allowance was made for the different distribution of the accepted event production points.\nThis study used about 1.5 million minimum bias\nand about 1.7 million topology triggers taken in a\n0.5 T field for 200 GeV per nucleon interactions.\nFigure 2a shows the pT distribution of all\ncharge-0 2-track vertices. The large peak for\npT < 100 MeV/c is a signature of fully coherent interactions. Like-sign pion pairs (the shaded\nhistogram) are used as a background estimate;\nthey are normalized to fit the unlike-sign pairs\nfor pT > 250 MeV/c. This procedure treats incoherent \u03c10 production (a photon scattering from a\nsingle nucleon in the target) as background.\nFigure 2b shows the rapidity distribution of the\ncoherent \u03c10 (pairs with pT < 150 MeV/c). The\npoints (data) are in excellent agreement with a\ncalculation based on the soft Pomeron model and\nour detector simulation.\nFigure 2c shows the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass, M\u03c0\u03c0\nfor the sample. The data is fit to a relativistic Breit-Wigner for the \u03c10 , plus a S\u00f6ding term\nto account for the interference with direct \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nproduction[21]. The interference shifts the peak\nof the distribution to lower M\u03c0\u03c0 . The direct \u03c0\u03c0\nto \u03c1 ratio agrees with the STAR 130 GeV analysis\n[6] and with that observed by the ZEUS collaboration in \u03b3p interactions [22].

The (a) pT , (b) rapidity and (c) \u03c0\u03c0\ninvariant mass spectra of \u03c10 using data from the\nminimum bias trigger. The mass is fit to to a\nBreit-Wigner function for the \u03c10 , plus a S\u00f6ding\nterm due to interference with a direct \u03c0\u03c0 component. The combinatoric hadronic and coherent\ne+ e\u2212 pair backgrounds are also shown.\n\nFor the interference analysis, a clean, lowbackground sample is important, so stringent\nevent selection criteria were used, at some cost in\nefficiency. Events were required to have exactly\ntwo tracks with a vertex within 50 cm longitudinally of the center of the TPC for the minimum\nbias sample, and 100 cm for the topology sample.\n\u03c10 candidates were further required to have rapidity |y| > 0.1, to eliminate a small remaining cosmic ray contamination. Finally, the pairs were required to have 550 MeV < M\u03c0\u03c0 < 920 MeV. The\nminimum mass cut removed most of the hadronic\nbackgrounds, which are concentrated at low M\u03c0\u03c0 .\nThese cuts reduced the like-sign pair background\nto a few percent. With these cuts, background\nfrom misidentified two-photon production of lepton pairs should be very small. The sample still\nincludes direct pions, which should have the same\nspin/parity and quantum mechanical behavior as\nthe pion pairs from \u03c1 decay. We do not distinguish between the two sources.\nThe interference depends on the amplitudes for\n\u03c1 production on the two nuclei. Away from y = 0,\nthe photon energies for the two photon directions\ndiffer, k1,2 = MV /2 exp(\u00b1y/2); the amplitudes\ndiffer and the interference is less than maximal.\nAlthough it is not expected in the soft-Pomeron\nmodel, the the photon energy difference could introduce a small \u03c10 production phase difference,\nwhich could affect the interference [2]. This analysis focuses on the region near mid-rapidity where\nany phase difference is small. A Monte Carlo calculation is used to find the interference for different rapidity ranges [4,8].\nWe use the variable t\u22a5 = p2T to study the interference. At RHIC energies, the longitudinal\ncomponent of the 4-momentum transfer is small,\nso t \u2248 t\u22a5 . Without interference, the spectrum\ndN/dt \u2248 exp (\u2212bt) for a variety of nuclear models [8,24]. Our calculations use a Woods-Saxon\ndistribution for the gold density distribution.\nFigure 3 compares the uncorrected minimum\nbias data for 0.1 < |\u03b7| < 0.5 with two simulations,\nwith and without interference.

The\ndashed histogram (blue) is a simulation that assumes that there is interference, while the dotdash histogram (black) is based on a calculation\nwithout interference. The solid black histogram\nwith very few counts is the like-sign background.\n\ntent with the hbi = 20 fm expected for a 3-photon\nreaction[15]. This drop matches the drop seen in\nthe calculation with interference, but is absent in\nthe calculation without the interference.\nThe efficiency corrected data are shown in Fig.\n4. Minimum bias and topology data are shown\nseparately, each with two rapidity bins: 0.1 <\n|y| < 0.5 and 0.5 < |y| < 1.0. The efficiency is\nindependent of pT . However pT smearing (resolution) does affect the spectrum slightly. The \u03c10 pT\nresolution is about 9 MeV/c, while the 1st t bin\ncovers 0 to (15 MeV/c)2 . Interference depletes\nthe first few bins, but feed down from the higher\nt bins partially repopulates them.\nThe data is fit to the 3-parameter form:\ndN\n= a exp(\u2212bt)[1 + c(R(t) \u2212 1]\n(4)\ndt\nwhere R(t) = Int(t)/N oint(t) is the ratio of the\nMonte Carlo t-spectra with and without interference. Here, a is the overall normalization, the\n2\nslope b \u2248 RA\n, and c is the degree of spectral\nmodification; c = 0 corresponds to no interfer-\n\nence while c = 1 is the expected interference.\nThis functional form separates the interference\n(c) from the nuclear form factor (b).\nTable 1 gives the results of the fits. At smallrapidities the amplitudes from the two directions\nare similar and the interference reduces the cross\nsection at pT = 0 by more than at larger rapidities. In the minimum bias data, the interference\nextends to higher pT than the topology data because the former has a smaller hbi.\nThe 4 c values are consistent within errors; the\nweighted average is c = 0.93 \u00b1 0.06. The b values\nfor the minimum bias and exclusive \u03c10 data differ\nby 20%: 364 \u00b1 7 GeV\u22122 for the exclusive \u03c1 versus\n303 \u00b1 10 GeV\u22122 for the Coulomb breakup events.\nThe different b values may be attributed to the\ndifferent impact parameter distributions caused\nby the nuclear breakup tagging in the minimum\nbias data. The photon flux depends on the impact parameter as 1/b2. When b \u2248 fewRA , \u03c1 are\nmore likely to be produced on the side of the target near the photon emitter than on the far side.\n\u03c10 production is concentrated on the near side,\nleading to a smaller effective production volume\nand the smaller b. This near-side skewing affects\nthe interference slightly, but is not included in\ncurrent calculations.\nSystematic errors come from a variety of\nsources. We have studied the effect of detector\ndistortions (primarily pT smearing) by turning off\nthe detector simulation and comparing raw simulations with reconstructed data. This lowered\nc by 18%; if the detector simulation is 75% correct (a very conservative assumption), then detector effects are a less than 5% systematic un-\n\n\f120\n\ndN/dt\n\ndN/dt\n\n6\n\n(a)\nSTAR Preliminary\nMin.

The points are the data, while the solid line is the result of the fit to Eq. 4.\n\n\f7\ncertainty. Minor systematic uncertainties come\nfrom backgrounds and the fitting procedure. We\nhave compared the data and simulations for a variety of kinematic and detector-based variables,\nand found good agreement. We estimate a preliminary experimental systematic uncertainty of\n8%.\nThis analysis depends on the shape of R(t),\nwhich is calculated following Ref. [8]. For the\nbroader picture, it is necessary to consider the\nsimplifications in Ref. [8]. The calculation averages the photon flux over the surface of the nucleus, rather than incorporating the proper 1/b2\nweighting. This may partly explain the relatively\npoor fit for the large-|y| Coulomb breakup fit.\nWe estimate that the effective impact parameter\nshould be within 10% of the actual ion-ion separation for the coulomb breakup data, and 3% for the\nexclusive \u03c1. The uncertainties in the calculations\nshould be at most a 15% effect. With this, the interference is 93\u00b16(stat.)\u00b18(syst.)\u00b115(theory)%\n(STAR preliminary) of that expected.\nThe \u03c1 decays rapidly, with \u03b3\u03b2c\u03c4 \u226a hbi and the\ntwo \u03c1 decay points are well separated in spacetime. In the usual space-time picture, the decays\noccur independently, and any interference must\ninvolve the final state \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Interference must\ninvolve identical final states from the two sources.\nHowever, given the large available phase space for\nthe decays, this is very unlikely for independent\ndecays.\nOne possible interpretation of this result is\ngiven in Ref. [10]. In it, the interference occurs\nbecause the post-decay wave function includes\namplitudes for all possible final states, then the\namplitudes for identical states subtract, and the\ninterference is visible. Because of the two sources,\nthe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 wave function is non-factorizable, and\nthus exhibits the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox [25]. We find that the decoherence, 1 \u2212 c, due\nto environmental or other factors is less than 43%\nat the 90% confidence level.\n5. e+ e\u2212 Pairs\nThe cross section for the production of e+ e\u2212\npairs is peaked near threshold, with pair mass\nMee \u2248 3.5m, where m is the electron mass. The\n\npairs are produced predominantly in a forwardbackward topology, with the e\u00b1 produced with\nlarge longitudinal (along the beampipe) momentum and small pT . This complicates experimental detection at an ion collider, and reduces the\nstatistics available to any analysis. This analysis\nused data about 800,000 minimum bias triggers\ntaken in a 0.25 T magnetic field. The lower magnetic field (compared to the 0.5 T full field data)\nincreased the sensitivity to low pT particles. The\nminimum bias trigger freed the electrons from the\nrequirement that they have a high enough pT to\nreach the CTB.\nThis analysis [26] used tracks with pT > 65\nMeV/c and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.15. In this region, tracking efficiency for electrons was above\n80%. The electrons were identified by dE/dx. To\nget good electron/hadron separation, we required\nthe tracks to have p < 130 MeV/c. In this momentum region, electrons had considerably higher\ndE/dx than hadrons, and the identification efficiency was nearly 100%, with minimal contamination. The cross section falls steeply with increasing Mee , so few leptons were expected with higher\nmomenta. We also required the events to have\npair pT < 100 MeV/c, pair rapidity |y| < 1.15\nand pair mass 140 MeV < Mee < 265 MeV. These\ncuts selected a sample of 52 events.\nThe major backgrounds in this analysis are due\nto misidentified coherent \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs and incoherent hadronic backgrounds. The former can\nbe calculated from the known cross section and\nmisidentification probability. The latter can be\nstudied by using like sign (\u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) pairs. The total\nbackground is estimated to be about 1.1 events.\nThe integrated luminosity of 94 \u00b1 9 mb\u22121 was\nestimated by counting hadronic events with at\nleast 8 tracks. This selected 80% of all hadronic\ngold-gold interactions. The integrated luminosity\nis based on an assumed gold-gold hadronic cross\nsection of 7.2 barns.\nFigure 5 shows the cross section as functions\nof pair mass and pT . The data is compared with\ntwo calculations. The first, shown by the solid\nline, uses Eq. 3, with a equivalent photon calculation for Pee (b). The second, provided by Kai\nHencken, was a quantum electrodynamic calculation, including photon virtuality.

Differential Cross sections for pair (a) mass and (b) pT . The data (points) are compared with\nthe results of a equivalent photon calculation (solid) and a quantum electrodynamics calculation (dashed\nline). All data and calculations are restricted to the kinematic region described in the text.\nference between the results of the two calculations\noccurs for pT < 15 MeV/c. The data strongly favors the QED calculation, by 4\u03c3.\nAs expected, the hpT i for e+ e\u2212 production is\nsmaller than for \u03c10 production. This is because\nthe Pomeron pT scale is roughly h\u0304/RA , while the\nphoton pT scale is very roughly Mee /\u03b3 \u2248 h\u0304/b.\nWithin the kinematic acceptance region, we\nfind a cross section \u03c3 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.3 mb (STAR\npreliminary). The major systematic errors are\ndue to tracking and vertexing uncertainty, and\nthe integrated luminosity. This is 1.2\u03c3 lower than\nthe equivalent photon prediction of 2.1 mb, and\n0.8\u03c3 below the QED calculation of \u03c3QED = 1.9\nmb for the same kinematic cuts. This measurement and the QED calculation can be used to put\nlimits on possible higher order corrections \u2206\u03c3 to\nthe cross section. At a 90% confidence level, we\nfind \u22120.5\u03c3QED < \u2206\u03c3 < 0.2\u03c3QED .\n6. Conclusions\nSTAR has studied a number of photonuclear\nand two-photon reactions. We observe both exclusive \u03c10 production and \u03c10 production accompanied by nuclear excitation. The cross sections and rapidity distributions match the predictions of the soft Pomeron model. We observe\n\ndestructive interference between the two production sites, at the expected level, and set an upper\nlimit on decoherence. Finally, we observe e+ e\u2212\npair production accompanied by mutual Coulomb\ndissociation. The kinematic distributions match\nthose predicted by lowest order quantum electrodynamics.\nWe thank Tony Baltz for providing the calculations of nuclear breakup and Kai Hencken for\nproviding the QED calculations.
