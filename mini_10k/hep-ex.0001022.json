Introduction\nSince the HERA and Tevatron colliders have been operational, abundant data have\nbecome available that are sensitive to proton structure at low parton-x. Data on photon\nstructure from HERA and LEP have been similarly impressive. This latest generation\nof colliders has pushed back the limits of our understanding of QCD considerably. There\nis not space here to do justice to all low x data. Instead, three particularly topical areas\nthat were discussed at the 1999 Durham Phenomenology Workshop are singled out.\n2. Factorisation in Hard Diffraction\nThe HERA and Tevatron experiments have now produced abundant high quality data\n(\u2212)\non the 'single diffractive' processes \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 Xp and p\u0304p \u2192 X p at low momentum\ntransfer. Hard scales, provided for example by a highly virtual photon (in the \u03b3 \u2217 p case)\nor final state jets or heavy quarks, encourage the use of perturbative QCD as a tool\nwith which to understand the parton level dynamics. The development of techniques\nwhich simultaneously describe the \u03b3 \u2217 p and p\u0304p single dissociation processes is a major\ncurrent issue in hadron phenomenology.\nThe generic diffractive process at HERA of the type ep \u2192 eXp is illustrated in\nfigure 1a. A photon of virtuality Q2 interacts with a proton at a \u03b3 \u2217 p invariant mass W\nand squared four momentum transfer t to produce a dissociating photon system X of\ninvariant masses MX , the proton remaining intact. In the corresponding process at the\n\u2021 Supported by the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).\n\n\fLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\n2\n\nTevatron, the photon is replaced by an anti-proton, with either of the beam particles\ndissociating.Two further variables are usually introduced; the fraction of the proton\nmomentum that is exchanged to the system X is denoted \u03be\u00a7, whilst \u03b2 = x/\u03be is the\nfraction of the exchanged momentum carried by the quark coupling to the photon.\n2\n\nQ\n\nW\n\n{\n\n\u03b3(\n\n(a)\n\n)\n\nx\n\n\u03b3\n(\u03b2)\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\nQ\n\nX (MX)\np\n\n(or low mass\np-excitation)\n\nt\n\nIP\np\n\n(small)\n\nxn\n\nkTn\n\nxn-1\n\nkTn-1\n\nq\ng\n\np\n\nq\n\n(z)\n\n(\u03be)\n\n(1-z)\np\n\n(c)\n\nx 1 kT 1\n\nFigure 1.

A q q\u0304 pair is produced via photon-gluon-fusion (\u03b3 \u2217 g \u2192 q q\u0304). (c)\nIllustration of the low x parton ladder in DIS.\n\nA QCD factorisation theorem has recently been proved for a general class of semiinclusive processes in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), which include the single diffractive\nprocess [1]. This implies that a concept of 'diffractive parton distributions' can be\nintroduced [2], expressing proton parton probability distributions under the constraint\nof an intact final state proton with particular values of \u03be and t. The cross section for\ndiffractive DIS can then be expressed as\n\u03c3\u03b3\n\n\u2217 p\u2192Xp\n\n(\u03be, t, x, Q2 ) \u223c\n\nX\ni\n\nfi/p (\u03be, t, x, Q2 ) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302\u03b3 \u2217 i (x, Q2 ) ,\n\n2\n\nwhere fi/p (\u03be, t, x, Q ) are the diffractive parton distributions, evolving with x and\nQ2 according to the DGLAP equations at fixed \u03be and t, and \u03c3\u0302\u03b3 \u2217 i (x, Q2 ) are parton\ninteraction cross sections.\nThe phenomenology of soft hadronic interactions suggests that it is possible to\nintroduce a universal factorisable pomeron exchange with a flux factor dependent only\non \u03be and t. With this additional assumption of 'Regge factorisation', the framework\nof diffractive parton distributions can be used to define parton distributions for the\npomeron [3], which should describe all hard diffractive scattering processes. The\ndiffractive DIS cross section can then be written as\n\u03c3\u03b3\n\n\u2217 p\u2192Xp\n\n(\u03be, t, \u03b2, Q2) \u223c fIP/p (\u03be, t) \u2297\n\nX\ni\n\nfi/IP (\u03b2, Q2 ) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302\u03b3 \u2217 i (\u03b2, Q2 ) .\n\nThe validity of this second hypothesis for diffractive DIS, incorporating both QCD\nand Regge factorisation, has been extensively tested at HERA. Measurements of the\n\u00a7 At HERA, \u03be is usually referred to as xIP . Here \u03be is used to make explicit the correspondence with\nthe equivalent variable at the Tevatron.\n\n\fLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\n3\n\ntotal cross section for diffractive deep-inelastic scattering, usually presented in the form\nD(3)\nof a t-integrated diffractive structure function F2 (\u03b2, Q2 , \u03be) [4\u20136] have shown that, to\nthe present level of accuracy, the factorisation between the \u03be and the (\u03b2,Q2 ) dependence\nis obeyed.k Parton distributions for the pomeron have been extracted [4, 7] from QCD\nanalyses of the \u03b2 and Q2 dependence of F2D using the DGLAP evolution equations. All\nsuch extractions yield parton distributions which are heavily dominated by gluons at low\nscales, the gluon density remaining large even at high fractional momentum. Figure 1b\nthen represents the dominant process at leading order of QCD. A gluon carrying a\nfraction z of the pomeron momentum undergoes boson-gluon fusion (\u03b3 \u2217 g \u2192 q q\u0304) with\nthe virtual photon.\nMonte Carlo models based on the parton distributions extracted from F2D describe\nHERA diffractive final state data well [8, 9]. The most stringent tests come from\ndiffractive dijet and open charm cross sections, as both are sensitive to the magnitude\nas well as the shape of the gluon distribution. Recent data from H1 on diffractive dijet\nelectroproduction [10] are shown in figure 2a. The factorisable partonic pomeron model\n(labelled \"res IP\") gives a reasonable description of the measurement. Similarly good\nagreement is found with ZEUS data on diffractive charm electroproduction [11], though\na diffractive D \u2217 measurement from H1 in a slightly different kinematic region suggests\ndeviations from factorisation [12]. With this single exception, HERA data support the\nhypothesis that both QCD and Regge factorisation can be applied to all hard diffractive\nprocesses in DIS.\nThere are good reasons to believe that the QCD factorisation theorem for diffractive\nDIS [1] cannot be extended to hard diffraction in hadron-hadron interactions [14]. The\nfactorisation hypothesis for pp\u0304 scattering has now been tested in some detail by taking\nparton distributions extracted from F2D data at HERA and using them to predict cross\nsections for hard diffractive processes at the Tevatron. By now it is clear that this\napproach universally predicts cross sections well in excess of those measured.\nOne example [15] is a measurement of the fraction N diff /N incl of all dijet events that\narise from the single dissociation process p\u0304p \u2192 Xp, where the intact final state proton\nhas 0.035 < \u03be < 0.095 and is scattered at |t| < 1 GeV2 . From this ratio, the quantity\n\n4\nN diff\n= incl (xp\u0304 ) xp\u0304 g(xp\u0304 ) + [q(xp\u0304 ) + q\u0304(xp\u0304 )]\nN\n9\np\u0304\nis formed, where xp\u0304 is the Bjorken scaling variable for the antiproton and xp\u0304 g(xp\u0304 ) +\n4\n[q(xp\u0304 ) + q\u0304(xp\u0304 )] represent the (known) effective parton densities in the anti-proton after\n9\nallowing for the leading order colour factor of 4/9. Assuming factorisation is valid, the\nresulting quantity should correspond to the effective parton densities of the pomeron;\n\u001a\n\u001b\n4\nD\nFJJ = \u03b2g(\u03b2) + [q(\u03b2) + q\u0304(\u03b2)]\n\u2297 fIP/p (\u03be) .\n9\nIP\nD\nThe quantity FJJ\nis shown as a function of \u03b2 in figure 2b and is compared with predictions\nbased on parton densities extracted from F2D by H1 [4].

The data are compared with predictions\nbased on two slightly different sets of diffractive parton densities extracted from F2D\n(top and bottom plots), the predictions being reduced by a factor of 20 for the plots.\n\nby a factor of 20, illustrating the size of the factorisation breaking effects. At least for\n< 0.3, the data and prediction are also rather different in shape.\n\u03b2\u223c\nAnother recent measurement from CDF is the fraction of visible beauty production\nthat is attributable to diffraction, which yields the result [16]\ndiff\n\u03c3b\u0304b\n= 0.62 \u00b1 0.19 (stat.) \u00b1 0.16 (syst.) ,\nincl\n\u03c3b\u0304b\n\nwhereas the predictions on the basis of diffractive parton densities extracted from ep\ndata are at the level of 10%.\nIn a complementary analysis, Alvero et al [7] have extracted diffractive parton\ndistributions from F2D and photoproduction dijet data from HERA and made predictions\nfor various Tevatron measurements. Similarly large discrepancies are found when\npredicting the rate of W and dijet production as components of the system X in the\n(\u2212)\nprocess p\u0304p \u2192 X p [17,18], with even larger differences for dijet production in the double\npomeron exchange process pp\u0304 \u2192 pX p\u0304.\nSomething beyond the simplest Regge and QCD factorisation assumptions is clearly\nrequired to describe simultaneously diffractive data from HERA and the Tevatron. The\npertinent question now is whether it is possible to build a phenomenological model\nof this breakdown of factorisation. One possibility is that where beam remnants are\npresent on both sides of a rapidity gap, rescattering takes place, tending to destroy the\ngap. A very interesting place to study this possibility is in photoproduction, where both\nfactorisable (direct photon) and non-factorisable (resolved photon) interactions may be\n\n\fLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\n5\n\nexpected to be present. A first study can be found in [20].\n3. Total Cross Sections\nTotal hadron-hadron cross sections are well described over a very wide energy range by\ntwo component Regge fits [21], corresponding (via the optical theorem) to the exchange\nof the pomeron and a sub-leading (\u03c1, \u03c9, f , a) trajectory in the elastic amplitude. The\nintercept of the leading pomeron trajectory is most accurately determined from the high\nenergy rise in the p\u0304p cross section. Other total cross sections such as \u03c0 \u00b1 p match this\n> 30 GeV.\nscheme well, though no data exist at centre of mass energies \u223c\nIn the case where one or both of the interacting hadrons is replaced by a photon,\narguments have been made that the presence of a bare photon coupling in addition to the\nvector meson dominance hadronic component may lead to a faster rise of the total cross\nsection with energy than is the case for pure hadron-hadron scattering. Eikonalised\nminijet models [22], incorporating semi-hard QCD interactions whilst avoiding the\neventual violation of unitarity associated with simple Regge pole models, can be made\nto fit the available data [23]. HERA data on the total \u03b3p cross section at centre of mass\nenergy W\u03b3p \u223c 200 GeV [24] are consistent with the simple Regge pole model, though the\nsystematic errors are large and no strong conclusion is yet possible. The increasingly\nprecise data from LEP on the total \u03b3\u03b3 cross section, which may be expected to rise\nfaster even than the \u03b3p cross section, may shed some light on this issue.\nBoth L3 [25] and OPAL [26] have measured the total \u03b3\u03b3 cross section in the region\n<\n10 \u223c W\u03b3\u03b3 < 100 GeV. For the data used, both electrons and many final state hadrons\nare lost down the beam-pipe, making the kinematics difficult to constrain. The data are\nshown, together with lower energy fixed target data, in figure 3a. The LEP data clearly\nshow the high energy rise with W observed in the p\u0304p, pp and \u03b3p cross sections. A simple\n2\nfactorisation law of the type \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 = \u03c3\u03b3p\n/\u03c3pp describes the data remarkably well.\nIt is not yet clear whether the rise with W is faster than that observed for total\nhadron-hadron cross sections; the OPAL data are consistent with the pomeron intercept\ndescribing soft hadronic interactions whereas the L3 result is significantly larger. The\nresults are rather sensitive to the assumptions on \u03b1IR (0). As can be seen from figure 3a,\na model based on minijets [23] also gives a reasonable description of the data, as do the\nSchuler and Sj\u00f6strand [27] and PHOJET [28] models, which attempt to make smooth\ntransitions between the photon in its hadronic and point-like manifestations.\nImproved data are required before a firm conclusion can be reached concerning the\ntot\npossible anomalous behaviour of \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\n. The main source of error in the measurements\narises from the model dependence of the acceptance corrections, with results different at\nthe level of \u223c 20% obtained when PHOJET or PYTHIA [29] is used for the corrections.\nThe principal reason for this is the different treatments of the diffractive channels in\nthe two models. Any constraints that can be placed on the diffractive processes in\n\u03b3\u03b3 scattering will improve the total cross section measurement considerably. Processes\ninvolving the quasi-elastic production of vector mesons are likely to be the easiest to\n\n\f800\n\n700\n\nOPAL\n\nMD-1\n\nL3\n\nTPC/2\u03b3\n\n6\n\u03c3 (nb)\n\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 [nb]\n\nLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\nPEP/2\u03b3\n\nData 183 GeV using Pythia VV\nData 183 GeV using phase space\n\nPLUTO\n600\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nL3 Preliminary\nPhase space\n-1.70\u00b10.09\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n(a)\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\u03c3\u03b3p2 /\u03c3pp\n\nSchuler and Sj\u00f6strand\n\neikon. mini-jet model\n\nEngel and Ranft (PHOJET)\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nW [GeV]\n\nPythia VV\n-2.04\u00b10.11\n10\n\n-3\n\n(b)\n1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 23\nRho pT2 (GeV )\n\nFigure 3.

A measurement of the t distribution of the single dissociation\nprocess is shown in figure 3b. Fitting the data to the usual exponential parameterisation\nd\u03c3/dt \u221d ebt yields a slope parameter in the region b \u223c 2. Information of this sort\nprovides very useful input to soft physics models and should ultimately reduce the\nmodel dependence uncertainties on the total cross section.\n4. Searches for BFKL Dynamics\nThe BFKL evolution equation, which resums terms where large logarithms of the\nform ln 1/x multiply the coupling constant, must represent a valid approximation to\nparton dynamics in some region of low x phase space. The search for evidence for\nBFKL behaviour is one of the principle current experimental activities in low x physics.\nAlthough it has been shown that introducing BFKL effects can improve the description\nof F2 at low x [30], it is not yet accepted that anything more than standard DGLAP\nevolution is required to describe current inclusive DIS data. Exclusive final state\nmeasurements may ultimately produce the clearest BFKL signatures. Some of the more\npromising areas of study are discussed below.\nBFKL and DGLAP evolution have rather different implications for the details of\nthe parton ladder governing low x DIS processes (figure 1c). In the DGLAP case, one\nexpects an ordering in virtuality (kt ) of the partons in the ladder, leading to rapidity\nordering of the transverse momenta of outgoing partons. The BFKL scheme has no such\n\n\fLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\n7\n\nfs(2D) (%)\n\nstrong ordering and therefore results in anomalously large high pT hadron yields away\nfrom the photon vertex, for example at central rapidity. The central region of the \u03b3 \u2217 p\nframe corresponds to the forward region of laboratory rapidity.\nBoth H1 and ZEUS have studied the production of jets in this difficult forward\nregion [31]. H1 have also measured the cross section for high pT forward \u03c0 0 production\n[32]. Similar conclusions are reached in each case. The ZEUS forward jet data are\nshown in figure 4a. The data cannot be described by standard DGLAP models (labelled\nLEPTO and HERWIG). Only models that do not impose strong transverse momentum\nordering are able to describe the data. One example is the ARIADNE model [33], based\non the colour dipole model and simulating BFKL ordering. However, the lack of strong\nkT ordering can also be modelled through the introduction of partonic structure to the\nvirtual photon. This can be implemented in the RAPGAP [34] Monte Carlo model,\ngiving a successful description of all forward region data produced at HERA to date.\nThus the final state data from the forward region at HERA demonstrate that something\nmore than the simplest DGLAP model of the low-x parton ladder is required. However,\nresolved virtual photons provide an alternative mechanism to BFKL to restore a good\ndescription of the data. Work on events with large rapidity separations between pairs\nof jets, just beginning at the Tevatron, may help to resolve some of these ambiguities.\n\nd\u03c3/dx [nb]\n\nZEUS 1995\n\nfree-factor\nsoft-color\nsingle-gluon\ntwo-gluon\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n10 2\n\n(a)\nb)\n\n1\n0.5\n\n10\n\n\u2022\n\n0\n10\n\nZEUS Data\n\n(a)\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n70\nET2 (GeV)\n\nLEPTO 6.5 (SCI)\n\n1\n\nHERWIG 5.9\n\n1.5\n\nLDC 1.0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n2 (b) low-ET\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nx\n\n(b)\n\nfs(2D) (%)\n\nfs(2D) (%)\n\nARIADNE 4.08\n\n2 (c) high-ET\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nFigure 4.

Data on the\n(2D)\nfraction fs\nof Tevatron dijet events where a rapidity gap separates the jets at\n\u221a\ns = 1800 GeV.\n\nIn appropriate kinematic regions, total, elastic and diffractive cross sections may\nall be describable in terms of the amplitude for elastic parton-parton scattering via the\nexchange of gluon ladders, evolving according to BFKL dynamics. BFKL calculations\nare most reliable where large scales are present at both vertices [35]. One example is\n\n\fLow x and Diffraction Experimental Summary\n\n8\n\nthe total \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 cross section [36]. Where both photons have sufficiently high virtuality,\nmeasurement conditions at LEP are favourable and first data have appeared [37]. The\ndata suggest a relatively strong energy dependence, which may be consistent with BFKL\npredictions. However the present data can be described equally well by non-BFKL QCD\nmodels, for example those involving virtual photon structure [38].\nAnother process where large scales are present at both vertices is diffractive\nscattering at large |t|, where precision data are starting to appear from HERA and\nthe Tevatron. The quasi elastic process \u03b3p \u2192 V Y where V denotes a vector meson and\nY is a proton or low mass proton excitation has been measured for V = J/\u03c8, \u03c1 and\n\u03c6 [39]. The results in the relatively low |t| regions accessed to date are mixed, only the\nJ/\u03c8 fully conforming to the BFKL predictions.\nThe classic high |t| diffractive process is the production of dijets separated by a\nrapidity gap, implying a net colour singlet exchange. Here, the magnitude of t is close\nto the jet ET2 and is thus very large. The size of the cross section is usually quantified as\nthe fraction of all dijet events that have a rapidity gap between the jets. Clear signals\nhave been observed at large jet pseudorapidity separation \u2206\u03b7 both in photoproduction\nat HERA [40] and in pp\u0304 interactions at the Tevatron [41, 42]. The gap fraction at large\n\u221a\n\u2206\u03b7 decreases with centre of mass energy, being around 0.1 at s \u2243 200 GeV at HERA,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0.025 at s = 630 GeV at the Tevatron and 0.01 at s = 1800 GeV at the Tevatron.\nThis trend is opposite to that naively expected from BFKL calculations. However, it\nseems likely that rapidity gap destruction due to reinteractions of beam remnants plays\nan important role. Two very different models of these effects [43, 44] both predict a\nrapidity gap survival probability that falls with centre of mass energy in a manner that\nqualitatively resembles that in the data.\nThe Tevatron gap fractions have been measured as a function of jet ET as well as\n\u2206\u03b7 (see figure 4b). The gap fraction is found to be flat or slowly rising with ETjet , which\nmatches predictions based on the creation of rapidity gaps by soft colour interactions\nin otherwise standard dijet events [45]. It has been demonstrated that if rapidity gap\ndestruction effects are included, BFKL dynamics can also describe these data [44].\nAll of the measurements discussed above can be interpreted in terms of BFKL\neffects, yet none conclusively demonstrates the need for BFKL at present colliders.\nData from the upgraded Tevatron and HERA may allow us to resolve this question.\nReferences\n[1] J.
