Partenskii2\nSamara State Academy of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Samara,\n443001, Russia\n2\nDepartment of Chemistry, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, 02454, USA\n1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMembrane-spanning peptides such as the ion channel gramicidin dimer, cause\nmembrane deformation which contribute significantly to both the energetics of\nthe insertion and the membrane-mediated interaction between the channels.\nRecently, interest in this field shifted from study of individual channels to study\nof collective effects in channel kinetics. Here we discuss an efficient way to\ndescribe the membrane-mediated interaction between the insertions in terms of\ncoupled harmonic oscillators and corresponding \"spring constants\".\n\n2\n\nVariational principle, boundary conditions and\nEuler-Lagrange equation.\n\nWe consider an elastic system extended in x, y\u2212plane, where the deformation can be described by a 2\u2212dimensional field of \"vertical\" displacement u(r)\n(r = (x, y) is the radius vector in the mid-plane of the system). The examples\ninclude smectic and similar models for lipid bilayers , and \"floating plate\" model\nof classical elastic theory (see [1] for review).\nThe elastic boundary problem can be formulated as a variational (minimum)\nprinciple for the energy functional\nZ\n(2)\nF [u] = g (2) (u, \u2207u, \u2206u, ...)df\n(1)\nwhere g (2) , the surface density of the elastic energy, is a quadratic function\nof the surface displacement u and its derivatives. We will consider a membrane\nwith N cylindrical insertions, assuming that on the contour \u03b3 i of i \u2212 th insertion\nboth u(r) and \u2207u(r) are fixed functions of r\u03b3 i , the position vector for the points\nbelonging to \u03b3 i . It leads to the boundary conditions\nu(r)|r\u03b3 i = ui (r\u03b3 i )\n\n(2)\n\n\u2207u(r)|nr\u03b3 = si (r\u03b3 i )\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\n1\n\n\f\"n\" designates the direction normal to \u03b3 i at the point r\u03b3 i .Note that the vertical displacement ui in the immediate contact of a membrane with an inserted\npeptide is typically described by the \"hydrophobic matching condition\" [2, 3, 1]\nleading to a particular case of Eq. 2 with ui (r\u03b3 i ) = u0 = const.\nAdditional conditions on the external membrane boundary (designated as\n\u03b3 \u221e ) are:\nu(r)|\u03b3 \u221e = 0\n\n(4)\n\n\u2207u(r)|\u03b3 \u221e = 0\n\n(5)\n\nIn many cases, including the biharmonic problem with smooth and continuous boundaries that we consider ([4], Ch. 6), the variational principle \u03b4F (2) = 0\n(the minimum condition for the energy functional) leads to the Euler-Lagrange\nequation which we present for now as\nL(u) = 0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere L is a linear differential operator 1 . The elastic energy E = min F (2) [u]\nis the value of F (2 [u] calculated with the solutions of Eqs. 6-5 in place of u. We\nwill show now that in some important cases E can be explicitly presented as a\nquadratic form of the boundary parameters, such as ui and si .\n\n3\n\nEffective spring constants\n\n3.1\n\nBoundary displacements and contact slopes fixed to\nconstants\n\nSuppose now that the boundary displacements and the contact slopes are fixed\nat the i \u2212 th insertion to the constants\nui and si . Some preliminary results for this case were reported in [5]. Eqs.\n2, 3 can be written as\n(7)\nu(r)|\u03b3 i = ui\n\u2207u(r)|n\u03b3i = si\n\n(8)\n\u03c6ui (r)\n\n\u03c6si (r), solutions\n\nWe now introduce the \"superfinite\" elements,\nand\nof\nEq. 6 satisfying boundary conditions Eq. 4-5 and following conditions at the\ninternal boundaries:\n\u03c6ui (r)|\u03b3 k = \u03b4 ik , \u2207\u03c6ui (r)|n\u03b3k = 0\n1 Which\n\n(9)\n\nmeans that L * (c1 u1 + c2 u2 ) = c1 L * u1 + c2 L * u2\n(c1 and c2 are the arbitrary constants). The linearity does not impose, however, any restrictions on the order of the differential equation (which for most of the applications considered\nis biquadratic).\n\n2\n\n\f\u03c6si (r)|\u03b3 k = 0, \u2207\u03c6si (r)|n\u03b3k = \u03b4 ik\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b4 ik is the Kronecker symbol. The solution of Eqs. 6 -5, 7, 8 can be\nwritten as a linear combination of the superfinite elements:\nu(r) =\n\nN\nX\n\n(ui \u03c6ui (r)+si \u03c6si (r))\n\n(11)\n\ni=1\n\nSubstituting this result into Eq. 1 allows presenting E as a quadratic form\nof the boundary parameters:\nE=\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\nc\u03b1\u03b2\nij \u03b1i \u03b2 j\n\n(12)\n\ni=1 j=i\n\nwhere c\u03b1\u03b2\nij are the effective spring constants describing interaction between\nthe insertions i and j (c\u03b1\u03b2\nii corresponds to the \"self energy\"of the i\u2212th insertions). Such a \"linear spring model\" was first introduced for a single insertion\nin [3] and later generalized in [5]. Eq. 12 implies that the additional summation\nis performed over the repeated indexes, \u03b1, \u03b2 (= u, s).\nThe effective spring constants satisfy the symmetry relation\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b1\nc\u03b1\u03b2\nij = cji and, consequently, cij = cji .\n\n(13)\n\nAs an illustration, consider the expression for g (2) which is typical in study\nof membranes:\ng (2) = B (\u2206u)2 + A u2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere A and B are proportional respectively to the membrane stretching\nand bending elastic constants and can be dependent on r, but not on u; \u2206 =\n\u2202 2 /\u2202x2 + \u2202 2 /\u2202y 2 is the Laplace operator.\nCombining Eqs. 11, 14 and 12, we find the spring constants:\nZ\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b2\ncij = (2 \u2212 \u03b4 ij ) (B\u2206\u03c6\u03b1\n(15)\ni \u2206\u03c6j + A\u03c6i \u03c6j )df\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nAzimuthal variation of the contact slope\nGeneral formulas\n\nA possibility that the contact slope can become anisotropic at the contours of\ntwo interacting insertions was studied in [6]. The slope was presented as\nsi (r\u03b3 i ) = ai + bi fi (r\u03b3 i )\n3\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere ai and bi do not depend on r, and fi (r) are the fixed functions.\nIn practice, functions fi (r) approximate the azimuthal variation of the contact\nslope. If energy is minimized over the slope parameters ai and bi , then different\nchoices of fi (r) result in different families of trial functions si (r\u03b3 i ) [6].\nThe surface displacement u(r) can be expressed now through the boundary\nparameters ai , bi and ui .\nu(r) =\n\nN\nX\n\n[ui \u03c6ui (r)+ai \u03c6ai (r)+bi \u03c6bi (r)]\n\n(17)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c6ui (r) and \u03c6ai (r) satisfy respectively the boundary conditions 9 and\n10, while \u03c6bi (r) satisfies the following conditions:\n\u03c6bi (r)|\u03b3 k = 0, \u2207\u03c6bi (r)|n\u03b3k = \u03b4 ik fi (r\u03b3 i )\n\n(18)\n\nThe energy is still described by Eq. 12 with the spring constants defined by\nEq. 12; the additional summation is now performed over the repeated indexes\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = (u, a, b) .\n\n3.2.2\n\nApplications for two insertions\n\nWe consider now two identical insertions. Due to possible fluctuations, parameters ui , ai and bi , and functions fi (r) for two insertions can still be different.\nThe energy of two insertions is\nE\n\n2\n2\naa 2\n2\nbb 2\n2\nua\n= cuu\n11 (u1 + u2 ) + c11 (a1 + a2 ) + c11 (b1 + b2 ) + 2c11 (u1 a1 + u2 a2 ) +\nab\nuu\naa\nbb\n2cub\n11 (u1 b1 + u2 b2 ) + 2c11 (a1 b1 + a2 b2 ) + c12 u1 u2 + c12 a1 a2 + c12 b1 b2 +\nub\nab\ncua\n(19)\n12 (u1 a2 + u2 a1 ) + c12 (u1 b2 + u2 b1 ) + c12 (a1 b2 + a2 b1 )\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b1\nwhere we used the symmetry conditions c\u03b1\u03b2\n11 = c22 , cij = cji = cij .\nWe now consider equilibrium setting. This case was discussed in [6]. The\nallowed functions fi (r) should satisfy the condition f1 (r) = f2 (\u2212r), where r =0\ndesignates the midpoint between the insertions, with boundary parameters for\nboth channels identical: u1 = u = u, a1 = a2 = a, b1 = b2 = b. Then, the\nenergy can be presented as\n\nE = Cuu u2 + Caa a2 + Cbb b2 + Cua ua + Cub ub + Cab ab\n\n(20)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nCa\u03b2 = (2 \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 )(2c\u03b1\u03b2\n11 + c12 )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere\n\n4\n\n\fThus the total number of the effective spring constants is reduced to six. We\nintent to study the optimized (\"relaxed\", \"equilibrium\") slope, so that\n\u2202E\n\u2202E\n= 0,\n=0\n\u2202a\n\u2202b\n\n(22)\n\nThese conditions lead to\n2Cbb Cua \u2212 Cab Cub\n2Caa Cub \u2212 Cab Cua\n2\na=\nu, b =\nu, \u2206 = Cab\n\u2212 4Caa Cbb (23)\n\u2206\n\u2206\nAs a result, the total energy minimized over a and b can be written as\nEmin = Ku2\nK=\n\n2\n2\nCbb (Cua\n\u2212 4Caa Cuu ) + Cab (Cab Cuu \u2212 Cua Cub ) + Caa Cub\n\u2206\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nWe can now see that six effective spring constants C\u03b1\u03b2 define the equilibrium\nslope parameters a and b and the equilibrium energy Emin .\nThe effective spring constants can be found from Eq. 15 . Sometimes, however, it is more practical to use the energy values E[{u, a, b}] defined for different\nsets {u, a, b} of the boundary parameters.\nFor every distance d between the insertions, the elastic energy E[{u, a, b}] can\nbe calculated numerically [1]. Then, all six spring constants can be found. The\nfollowing equations illustrate this approach:\nCuu\n\n=\n\nCua\n\n=\n\nCab\n\n=\n\nE[{0, a, 0}]\nE[{0, 0, b}]\nE[{u, 0, 0}]\n, Caa =\n, Cbb =\n,\nu2\na2\nb2\nE[{u, 0, b}] \u2212 Cuu u2 \u2212 Cbb b2\nE[{u, a, 0}] \u2212 Cuu u2 \u2212 Caa a2\n; Cub =\n;\nua\nub\nE[{0, a, b}] \u2212 Caa a2 \u2212 Cbb b2\n;\nab\n\nWith these constants, the equilibrium (or minimized over the slope parameters)\ninteraction energy profile Emin (d) can be determined from Eq. 20.\n\n4\n\nFinal remarks\n\nIt was shown that interaction energy between the insertions can be described\nin terms of effective spring constants accounting for the coupling between various degrees of freedom introduced through the boundary conditions. After the\nspring constants are defined, the equilibrium slope (which can in general become\nanisotropic) and corresponding interaction energy can be defined analytically.\nThis approach is much more efficient than the direct energy minimization used\nin [1]. Some applications of this approach will be considered elsewhere.\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] P. Jordan, G. Miloshevsky, and M.
