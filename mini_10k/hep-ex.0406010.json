The total integrated luminosity\nused in the analysis is 650 pb\u22121 . At LEP this process was first observed by the OPAL\ncollaboration [1] and subsequently studied by the L3 collaboration [2].\nThe final state e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 can be produced via a set of Feynman diagrams. In this\npaper we present the cross-section measurement for the contribution of the so-called\nmultiperipheral graph (Fig. 1) which corresponds to collisions of two virtual photons.\nThe same final states produced via other diagrams (less then 1% of the cross-section) are\nconsidered as a background.\ne\n\ne\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\ne\n\ne\n\nFigure 1: The dominant diagram for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\nThe study of the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 explores two fundamental problems. First\nof all it provides a deep test of QED at the level of the fourth order in \u03b1. Furthermore,\nthe \u03b3\u03c4 \u03c4 vertex is sensitive to the anomalous electromagnetic couplings of the tau lepton.\nSince the multiperipheral e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process diagram contains two such vertices,\nthe anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments can be extracted by comparing the\nmeasured cross-section with QED expectations.\nThe rest of the paper gives a detailed description of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 crosssection measurement, including tau-pair selection, background estimation, selection and\ntrigger efficiency calculation and systematic error estimation. In the last part of the paper\nthe measured cross-sections are used to derive limits on the anomalous electromagnetic\nmoments of the tau lepton.\n\n2\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\n\nThe signal process was simulated using the Berends, Daverveldt and Kleiss generator\nRADCOR (BDKRC) [3], which calculates the cross-section for the multiperipheral diagram with radiative corrections on the electron and positron lines. The following signal\ndefinition was used: the invariant mass of tau pairs had to be less than 40 GeV/c2 ; both\nbeam particles had to be scattered by less than 10 degrees; and at least one of them had\nto be scattered by less than 2 degrees. With these restrictions the accepted cross-section\nwas 1.44\u00b10.04% lower than the total cross-section predicted by BDKRC (which is about\n450 pb at LEP2 energies) for the unrestricted phase space. The \u03c4 decay was simulated by\n\n\f2\n\nthe TAUOLA package [4], which includes photon radiation from the decay products. The\nBDKRC generator was also used to estimate the background coming from the process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .\nTo simulate the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 background, the Berends, Daverveldt and Kleiss\ngenerator DIAG36 (BDK) [5] was used. Hadron production in two photon collisions was\nsimulated by PYTHIA 6.1 [6]. Non-multiperipheral four-fermion processes (such as WW,\nZZ, Zee and others) were simulated by WPHACT [7].\nThe generated events were passed through the full simulation program of the DELPHI\ndetector and were reconstructed with the same program as for the real data [8].\n\n3\n\nEvent selection\n\nIn most events produced by two-photon collisions both beam particles scatter at small\nangles and remain undetectable inside the beam pipe. Therefore only the decay products\nof the tau leptons can be seen in the detector. To suppress background, only one-prong\ndecay channels with one tau decaying into an electron and the other into a non-electron\n(hadron or muon) were considered. The analysis was based entirely on the measured\ntracks of charged products of tau decays; the neutral particles from tau decays were\nignored in this analysis.\nTo select runs with good performance of the sub-detectors [8]\u2013 [9], only runs with the\nTime Projection Chamber (TPC), the Forward Chambers (FCA, FCB) and one of the\nadditional barrel tracking detectors (ID or VD) fully operational were retained. Table 1\npresents the luminosities used in the analysis, luminosity-weighted centre-of-mass energies\nand energy ranges.\n\n\u22121\n\nLuminosity, pb\n< Ecm >, GeV\nEnergy range, GeV\n\n1997\n52.3\n182.7\n182.7\n\n1998\n152.6\n188.7\n188.7\n\n1999\n224.2\n197.6\n195.5 \u2013 201.5\n\n2000\n217.5\n206.3\n204.5 \u2013 208.0\n\nTable 1: The integrated luminosities, mean collision energies and collision energy ranges.\nThe event selection procedure was divided into two steps. The first step (preselection)\nselected a sample of two-photon events with two good tracks which were not back-toback in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis. A track was considered as good if\nthe momentum derived from its curvature was greater than 100 MeV/c, momentum error\nbetter than 100%, polar angle \u03b8 between 20\u25e6 and 160\u25e6 , and impact parameter with respect\nto the interaction point below 10 cm along the z-axis 1 and 5 cm in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane.\nThe following cuts were applied in this first selection step:\n\u2022 There had to be exactly two good tracks from particles with opposite charges, at\nleast one of them having momentum greater than 300 MeV/c.\n\u2022 To suppress background from fermion pair production, the total energy of two\ncharged particles had to be less than 30 GeV.\n1 The DELPHI coordinate system has the z-axis aligned along the electron beam direction, the x-axis pointing toward\nthe centre of LEP and the y-axis vertical. r is the radius in the (x, y) plane. The polar angle \u03b8 is measured with respect\nto the z-axis and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is about z.\n\n\f3\n\n\u2022 To enrich the sample with e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events, the acoplanarity of two tracks\n2\nhad to be greater than 0.5\u25e6 and their resultant transverse momentum greater than\n500 MeV/c.\n\u2022 To select events with a high trigger efficiency, the transverse energy, defined by\nEt = E1 sin \u03b81 + E2 sin \u03b82 ,\nwhere E1 and E2 are the energies of the two charged particles and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are\ntheir polar angles, had to be greater than 2 GeV.\n\u2022 In the year 2000, the operation of one of the twelve TPC sectors was unstable and\nthe dE/dx measurement vital for this analysis was poor, so events with at least one\ntrack in or near (closer than 10\u25e6 in \u03c6) to this TPC sector in 2000 were rejected.\n\u2022 Finally, to ensure the transverse momentum balance of \u03b3\u03b3 system, single and double\ntagged events were rejected by requiring that no energy deposition in the forward\nelectromagnetic calorimeters (STIC or FEMC) exceeded 60% of the beam energy.\nThe last cut suppressed the events with highly virtual photons. About 90% of events\npassing this cut had the momentum transfer \u2212q 2 less then 1 GeV2 /c2 . After applying\nthe cuts described above, the predicted event composition in the preselected sample was\nas follows (1999 data):\ne+ e\u2212\ne+ e\u2212\ne+ e\u2212\ne+ e\u2212\ne+ e\u2212\n\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304\n\u2192 \u03c4 +\u03c4 \u2212\n\n41 %\n47 %\n8%\n3%\n1%\n\nThe fraction of other events was less than 1%. The efficiency of the preselection for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events was of the order of 5%, the largest suppression of the signal\ncoming from the requirement of exactly two good tracks seen in the detector (about a\nfactor of 4) and from the cut on Et (about factor of 2). Figure 2 shows the comparison\nbetween data and simulation of the distributions of invariant mass, total energy, total\ntransverse energy and total transverse momentum of the pair of charged particles. The\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events are shown by the shaded histogram. The Monte Carlo is\nnormalised to the luminosity of the real data. The data deficit is mainly due to the\ntrigger inefficiency which is corrected at the later stages of analysis.\nIn the final step of the selection, the event was retained if one of the charged particles\nwas identified as an electron and the other as a non-electron. This step was based on the\nTPC measurement of the dE/dx pulls for the muon, electron, kaon and proton hypotheses.\nThe dE/dx pull for a specific particle hypothesis is defined as the ratio\n\u03a0X =\n\n(dE/dx)meas \u2212 (dE/dx)exp\n,\n\u03c3dE/dx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (dE/dx)exp is the value expected for the particle X with given momentum and\n\u03c3dE/dx is the error of the measured energy loss (dE/dx)meas . To check the dE/dx calibration, test samples of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 events were picked out\nfrom the preselected sample. A small angular dependence of the dE/dx measurements\nwas found as well as some disagreement between data and simulation. Corrections which\nwere functions of azimuthal and polar angle were applied to the measured dE/dx values.\nResidual disagreement was removed by scaling and smearing the specific energy loss measurement in the simulated events. Independent calibrations of real and simulated data\n2 Acoplanarity\n\nis defined as 180\u25e6 \u2212 |\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 |.\n\n\f4\n\nwere performed for each year of data taking analysed. The efficiency to measure dE/dx\nis discussed later in the paper.\nWith corrected dE/dx information, a track was identified as an electron if \u03a0\u03bc > 3 and\nas a non-electron if \u03a0e < \u22123. Figure 3 illustrates the particle identification cuts. The\ndistributions of the pulls for the electron and muon hypotheses are shown for the 1999\nreal data and simulation. Each distribution is shown after applying all selection cuts\nexcept the cut on the variable shown. The shaded histograms show the signal.\nA considerable amount of kaon and proton background from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 events\nremained after the cuts on the pulls for the muon and electron hypotheses. Figure 4 (left)\nshows the specific energy loss for electron candidates plotted versus the momentum of\nthe particle. Proton and kaon bands are clearly visible. To remove the kaon and proton\nbackground, the electron selection was tightened. The dE/dx for the electron candidate\nhad to not exceed 1.9 times the minimum ionisation, and the pulls for the proton and\nkaon hypotheses for the electron candidate both had to be outside the \u00b11.5\u03c3 interval:\n|\u03a0K | > 1.5 and |\u03a0p | > 1.5. Figure 4 (right) shows the distribution of the pull for the\nproton hypothesis with all selection cuts applied except the cut on the variable shown.\nThe hatched histogram shows the background from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 events, the shaded\nhistogram shows the rest of the background. The cuts on this variable are indicated by\narrows.\nTable 2 summarises the efficiency of the preselection, final step of selection and overall\nselection efficiency. The drop in the preselection in 2000 is caused by the removal of\nevents in or near the unstable TPC sector. The uncertainties of the selection efficiency\ndetermination are discussed later in the paper.\n\npreselection\nselection\noverall\n\n1997\n5.39\n17.3\n0.93\n\n1998\n5.37\n16.4\n0.88\n\n1999\n5.38\n16.4\n0.88\n\n2000\n3.85\n16.1\n0.62\n\nTable 2: Efficiencies (%): preselection, final step of selection and overall efficiency.\nIn total 2390 candidate events were selected. Figure 5 compares the distributions\nof electron and non-electron candidate momenta for selected events to the simulation\nprediction for the combined 1997-2000 data. Figure 6 shows the visible invariant mass\ndistribution for selected events for the same data sample. Trigger efficiency is taken into\naccount in these distributions (see below).\n\n3.1\n\nTrigger efficiency\n\nThe low momenta of the \u03c4 decay products in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and the\npresence of only two tracks in the event could make the probability of triggering on such\nan event considerably below 100%. The determination of the trigger efficiency is therefore\nimportant in this analysis.\nThe trigger efficiency was estimated from the subsamples of selected events using\nthe fact that an event can be detected by different components of the DELPHI trigger\nsystem [10]. Trigger subcomponents of the tracking system were combined into barrel\nand end-cap triggers. For events with one track in the barrel and the other in the end-cap,\nthe number of events detected by the barrel trigger (NB ), by the end-cap trigger (NE ),\n\n\f5\n\nand by both triggers (NBE ) were counted using the decision functions of the trigger.\nThe barrel and end-cap single track trigger efficiencies were calculated, for electrons and\nnon-electrons separately, by the formulae:\n\u03b5Barrel =\n\nNBE\n;\nNE\n\n\u03b5end\u2212cap =\n\nNBE\n.\nNB\n\n(2)\n\nFinally, the efficiency of the DELPHI calorimetric trigger to the whole event was estimated\nfrom the events triggered by any of the tracking detectors using a similar technique. The\nresults of the trigger efficiency calculation are summarised in Table 3. The track pair\ntrigger efficiency was calculated from the \"OR\" of the single track efficiencies using the\nratio of the barrel and forward tracks predicted by simulation. The tau pair trigger\nefficiency was calculated as \"OR\" of the tracking and calorimetric triggers.\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nelectron\nnon-electron\n\n71.4 \u00b1 17.1\n100+0\n\u221217.9\n\n94.4 \u00b1 5.4\n85.2 \u00b1 6.8\n\n84.6 \u00b1 7.1\n85.0 \u00b1 8.0\n\n92.3 \u00b1 7.4\n78.6 \u00b1 11.0\n\nelectron\nnon-electron\n\n26.3 \u00b1 10.1\n31.3 \u00b1 11.6\n94.5+5.5\n\u22127.1\n6.7 \u00b1 1.9\n94.9+5.1\n\u22126.6\n\n36.5 \u00b1 6.1\n30.4 \u00b1 6.1\n95.5 \u00b1 2.7\n8.6 \u00b1 1.2\n95.9 \u00b1 2.5\n\n21.5 \u00b1 4.6\n25.9 \u00b1 4.8\n93.3 \u00b1 3.5\n7.1 \u00b1 0.9\n93.8 \u00b1 3.3\n\n22.0 \u00b1 6.9\n23.1 \u00b1 5.8\n93.5 \u00b1 4.1\n7.7 \u00b1 1.1\n94.0 \u00b1 3.8\n\nBarrel track\n\nEnd-cap track\n\nTrack pair\nCalorimetry\nTau pair\n\nTable 3: Summary of the trigger efficiency measurements (%)\n\n3.2\n\nEfficiency of the dE/dx measurement\n\nBoth tracks of the selected event had to have specific energy loss measurements. An\nimperfect detector simulation can lead to a discrepancy in the dE/dx measurement efficiency for good tracks in real and simulated events. To take into account this possible\ndisagreement, the efficiency for a good track to have a dE/dx measurement (to be a\n\"good TPC track\") was calculated for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 samples extracted from preselected events (efficiencies to measure dE/dx of pions and muons\nwere assumed to be equal). Muon events were selected by requiring at least one track to\nbe identified by the muon chambers and electron events were selected using information\nfrom the DELPHI RICH detectors. For muon and electron events the efficiency to be a\n\"good TPC track\" was determined from the ratio\n\u03b52dE/dx =\n\nNdE/dx\nNtot\n\n(3)\n\nwhere NdE/dx is the number of events with both tracks having a dE/dx measurement and\nNtot was the total number of selected events in the given sample. The tau-pair efficiency\nwas estimated as the product of the single track efficiencies for muon and electron. The\ntau-pair efficiencies derived from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 events for\ndata and Monte Carlo are presented in Table 4 and were used for selection efficiency\ncorrection and for systematic error estimation. The selection efficiency was multiplied\n\n\f6\n\n\u03b5\n\n(data)\n\nby the factor \u03b5dE/dx\nand half of the correction was included into the systematic error\ndE/dx (M C)\ntogether with the uncertainties from the test sample statistics.\n\nEfficiency in data, %\nEfficiency in MC, %\n\n1997\n82.9 \u00b1 1.0\n82.3 \u00b1 0.4\n\n1998\n82.6 \u00b1 0.6\n82.5 \u00b1 0.2\n\n1999\n82.4 \u00b1 0.5\n82.3 \u00b1 0.1\n\n2000\n83.5 \u00b1 0.6\n84.6 \u00b1 0.2\n\nTable 4: Summary of \"good TPC track\" efficiency estimations.

The contribution from other background sources was negligible.\nThe theoretical precision of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 generation by PYTHIA is not well known.\nTherefore it was estimated from the real data by inverting the dE/dx cut on the electron\ncandidate: dE/dx >1.9 M.I.P. instead of dE/dx <1.9 M.I.P. After comparing these test\nsamples enriched with e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 events with the simulation, an error of 20% was\nascribed to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 event generator.\nChannel\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc\u03bc\nother 4-fermion\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\nTotal\n\n1997\n4.3 \u00b1 1.5\n2.7 \u00b1 0.2\n2.9 \u00b1 0.1\n1.5 \u00b1 0.3\n0.69 \u00b1 0.01\n12.1 \u00b1 1.5\n\n1998\n3.2 \u00b1 0.7\n3.4 \u00b1 0.1\n5.0 \u00b1 0.1\n1.5 \u00b1 0.3\n0.55 \u00b1 0.01\n13.6 \u00b1 0.8\n\n1999\n3.3 \u00b1 0.8\n4.0 \u00b1 0.1\n2.4 \u00b1 0.1\n1.2 \u00b1 0.2\n0.47 \u00b1 0.01\n11.4 \u00b1 0.8\n\n2000\n3.2 \u00b1 0.8\n2.4 \u00b1 0.1\n3.8 \u00b1 0.1\n1.2 \u00b1 0.2\n0.40 \u00b1 0.01\n11.0 \u00b1 0.8\n\nTable 5: Summary of background fractions. The numbers are the expected fractions (%)\nof the specified backgrounds in the selected sample. Errors are statistical errors of the\nsimulated samples and theoretical uncertainties of the Monte Carlo generators added in\nquadrature.\n\n\f7\n\n4\n\nSystematic error estimation\n\nThe following sources of systematic error on the cross-section measurement were considered: uncertainties of selection and trigger efficiencies and uncertainty of background\nlevel. Track selection, event selection and the statistical error of the simulated samples\nwere taken into account in the calculation of the uncertainty in the selection efficiency.\nThe systematic error arising from track selection was estimated in the following way.\nEach cut of the track selection was varied typically by the size of the resolution of the\ncorresponding variable from its nominal value in both directions. The corresponding\nchange of the cross-section \u2206 was compared to the value of the expected statistical\nfluctuation \u03c3 due to the non-identical event sample. If the value \u2206 was less than \u03c3, no\nsystematic\nerror was ascribed to the corresponding cut; in the opposite case the value\n\u221a\n2\nof \u2206 \u2212 \u03c3 2 was included in the systematic error. The systematic error arising from\nvarying the event selection cuts was estimated in a similar way.\nTo calculate the systematic error due to the angular corrections applied to the dE/dx\nmeasurements, the dE/dx correction functions were varied by the uncertainty of each of\ntheir parameters and the analysis chain was repeated. The variation of the measured\ncross-section was added to the systematic error. The systematic errors corresponding to\nscaling and smearing the pulls were calculated similarly.\nThe systematic errors associated with track selection cuts, event selection cuts and\ndE/dx corrections are summarised in Table 6. The numbers are given for 1999 data (for\nother years uncertainties of most of the sources scale approximately as inverse square\nroot of the statistics). Additional contributions to the selection efficiency uncertainty\nalso presented in Table 6 come from the statistical error of the Monte Carlo sample and\nthe selection efficiency correction described in Section 3.2.\nThe largest contribution to the systematic error is given by the uncertainty of the\ntrigger efficiency determination, dominated by the statistics of the real data events, see\nSection 3.1 and Table 3. An additional contribution arises because the trigger efficiency\nfor background events, assumed to be equal to that of the signal, may be different. A\nconservative estimate of this uncertainty was obtained by changing the trigger efficiency\nfor background upwards to 100% and downwards by the same amount.\nThe systematic error due to residual background includes the simulated sample statistical uncertainty and the theoretical uncertainty of the Monte Carlo generators, mainly\nfor the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 qq\u0304 process, see Table 5.\nThe sources of selection efficiency uncertainty are described in detail in Table 6.\nThe sources of systematic uncertainty are summarised in Table 7. Total systematic\nerrors calculated as the sum in quadrature of all described components are also presented\nin Table 7. The following uncertainties were assumed to be fully correlated between different years: generator theoretical error; trigger efficiency for background; and uncertainties\nestimated from variation of track and event selection cuts. Systematic errors from other\nsources were treated as uncorrelated.\n\n5\n\nResults of the cross-section measurement\nThe cross-sections were computed using the formula\n\u03c3=\n\nNobs \u2212 Nbg\n\u03b5sel \u03b5trig L\n\n(4)\n\n\f8\n\nsyst. error source\ntrack selection cuts\n\nvalue, %\nRimp\nZimp\n\u03b4p/p\n\n0.7\n1.1\n0.7\n\n\u03a0e\n\u03a0\u03bc\nacoplanarity\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.6\n\n\u03a0e \u03b8\n\u03a0e \u03c6\n\u03a0\u03bc \u03b8\n\u03a0\u03bc \u03c6\nscaling\nsmearing\n\n1.0\n0.9\n1.0\n1.0\n0.7\n0.6\n0.8\n\nevent selection cuts\n\ndE/dx corrections\n\nMC statistics\n\"Good TPC track\"\ncorrection\nTotal\n\n0.6\n3.0\n\nTable 6: Systematic errors for 1999 data coming from track selection, event selection,\ndE/dx corrections, simulated samples statistics and \"good TPC track\" correction.\n\nwhere Nobs is the number of observed events, Nbg is the expected number of background\nevents in the assumption that background events have the same trigger efficiency as signal\nevents, \u03b5sel is the selection efficiency, \u03b5trig is the trigger efficiency and L is the integrated\nluminosity.\nThe numbers of observed and expected events, the measured cross-sections and the\ncross-sections from the BDKRC Monte Carlo simulation together with their ratios are\npresented in Table 8. The predicted number of events was calculated from the signal\nand background simulation, taking into account trigger efficiency and corrections to the\ndE/dx efficiency. Agreement was found between the measurements and the Standard\nModel (SM) predictions calculated by BDKRC. The ratio of observed and predicted crosssections was averaged over all LEP2 data, taking into account correlations of systematic\nerrors. The result was found to be 0.96\u00b10.04. The average LEP2 cross-section is 429\u00b117\npb corresponding to the luminosity-weighted mean centre-of-mass energy of 197.1 GeV.\nThe cross-section predicted at this energy by BDKRC is 447.7 \u00b1 0.3 pb.\n\n6\n\nDetermination of anomalous magnetic and electric\ndipole moments\n\nIn the Standard Model, leptons are considered as point-like objects. Therefore the\nobservation of a deviation of the magnetic or electric dipole moments of the leptons from\ntheir SM values would open a window onto the physics beyond the SM.

The first error on the measured cross-sections is statistical,\nthe second is systematic.\nbut the short life-time of the tau-lepton does not allow measurement of its anomalous\nmoments with similar precision by a spin precession method.\nThe generalised form of the \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03b3 vertex can be parametrised as follows:\nq\u03bd\nq\u03bd\n+ F3 (q 2 )\u03b3 5 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd\n}u(p)\u01eb\u03bc (q)\n(5)\n\u2212ie\u016b(p\u2032 ){F1 (q 2 )\u03b3 \u03bc + iF2 (q 2 )\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd\n2m\u03c4\n2m\u03c4\nwhere \u01eb\u03bc (q) is the polarization vector of the photon with momentum q. The form factor\nF1 describes the distribution of electric charge and e\u03c4 = eF1 (0), while F2 and F3 are form\nfactors related to the anomalous magnetic moment a\u03c4 and electric dipole moment d\u03c4 :\na\u03c4 \u2261\n\ng\u03c4 \u2212 2\n= F2 (0)\n2\n\n(6)\n\nand\n\n2m\u03c4 d\u03c4\n(7)\ne\u03c4\nIn the SM at tree level, a\u03c4 = 0 and d\u03c4 = 0. Accounting for loop diagrams gives a non-zero\nvalue to a\u03c4 = 11773(3) * 10\u22127 [13], while a non-zero value of d\u03c4 is forbidden by both T\ninvariance and P invariance.\nThe values of a\u03c4 and d\u03c4 have been measured by several groups. The L3 and OPAL\ncollaborations [14,15] studied radiative Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03b3 events and set the following 95 % CL\nlimits on the values of the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments:\nF3 (0) = \u2212\n\n\u22120.052 < a\u03c4 < 0.058\n\u22120.068 < a\u03c4 < 0.065\n\nand |d\u03c4 | < 3.1 (10\u221216 e * cm)\nand |d\u03c4 | < 3.7 (10\u221216 e * cm)\n\nThe best limit so far on d\u03c4 was obtained by BELLE [16]:\n\n\u22120.22 < Re(d\u03c4 ) < 0.45 (10\u221216 e * cm)\n\n\u22120.25 < Im(d\u03c4 ) < 0.08 (10\u221216 e * cm)\n\nOther limits on a\u03c4 and d\u03c4 can be found in [17].\n\n(L3)\n(OPAL).\n\n\f10\n\n6.1\n\nLimits from this analysis\n\nHere we present the study of the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of\nthe tau lepton based on the analysis of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 cross-section. The study\nof anomalous couplings of tau leptons to photons at LEP in this channel was proposed\nin [18].\nTo model the contribution of non-SM anomalous magnetic and dipole moments we\nuse the calculation by Cornet and Illana [19]. The calculation is based on computation\nof the matrix element of the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in leading order of QED and its translation to the cross-section of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process using the Equivalent Photon\nApproximation (EPA) [20]. The EPA parameter (\u2212q 2 )max (the upper limit of the integration over 4-momenta of the emitted photon) was chosen such that the total cross-section\npredicted by EPA (with SM values of anomalous electromagnetic moments) agreed with\nBDKRC calculation. According to the calculations [19] each of the anomalous terms\nof (5) would mainly modify the rate of tau pair production in the barrel region of the\ndetector where the experimental selection has largest efficiency. This leads to a larger\nselection efficiency for the anomalous term contribution, improving in principle the limits\nobtained on anomalous moments. However in this paper we conservatively assumed that\nthe standard and anomalous contributions have the same selection efficiency.\nFigure 7 shows how the total cross-section changes as a function of the anomalous\nmagnetic moment and as a function of the\n\u221a electric dipole moment. The three lines on\neach plot represent the calculation with s =182.7, 195.5 and 205.0 GeV. Increasing\nthe collision energy slowly increases both non-SM contributions. However, increasing\nthe magnitude of the anomalous magnetic moment can either increase or decrease the\ncross-section while increasing that of the electric dipole moment tends only to increase\nthe cross-section.\nTo compare the experimentally measured values of the cross-sections to the non-SM\ncalculation, they were first converted from accepted to the total cross-sections, taking into\naccount the 1.44% difference due to the signal definition (see section 2). The validity of\napplying SM conversion factors is supported by the fact that the measured cross-sections\nare in good agreement with the SM prediction, which guarantees the smallness of the\nnon-SM contribution, and by the fact that the correction itself is small.\nFits to the cross-sections measured in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 were performed taking\na\u03c4 and d\u03c4 as parameters. When fitting for a\u03c4 , the value of d\u03c4 was set to its SM value and\nvice versa. The errors on the cross section measurements were taken as the statistical\nand systematic errors added in quadrature.\nTo quote the obtained limits we used the following convention:\nZ L\nZ \u221e\n1 \u2212 CL\n2\nexp (\u2212\u03c7 /2) da\u03c4 =\nexp (\u2212\u03c72 /2) da\u03c4 =\n(8)\n2\n\u2212\u221e\nR\nwhere CL is the desired confidence level and L and R are lower and upper limits. A\nsimilar definition was used for d\u03c4 . We quote central values \u03bc and errors \u03c3 for moments\naccording to\nR\u2212L\nR+L\n\u03c3=\n, \u03bc=\n.\n(9)\n2\n2\nwhere R and L are calculated with 68.3% confidence level.\nFigure 8 shows the \u03c72 as a function of the anomalous magnetic moment and as a\nfunction of the electric dipole moment. The results of the fit are:\n\u22120.052 < a\u03c4 < 0.013,\n|d\u03c4 | < 3.7 * 10\u221216 e * cm,\n\n95% CL\n95% CL.\n\n\f11\n\nThe limit on a\u03c4 improves the current PDG limit [21] based on the L3 result [14].\nFigure 9 shows the the measured\ncross-section, average LEP2 cross-section and SM\n\u221a\nexpectation as a function of s. Two bands superimposed on the plot represent the\nallowed region for the cross-section variation due to anomalous magnetic and electric\ndipole moments. The results expressed in the form of central value and error are the\nfollowing:\na\u03c4 = \u22120.018 \u00b1 0.017,\nd\u03c4 = (0.0 \u00b1 2.0) * 10\u221216 e * cm.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have studied the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with the data collected with the\nDELPHI detector during LEP2 operation in the years 1997-2000. The average LEP2\ncross-section was found to be 429\u00b117 pb compared to 447.7 pb expected from the Standard model. The measured/predicted ratio 0.96\u00b10.04 agrees with the QED prediction\nat the level of one standard deviation. The measured cross-sections were used to extract\nlimits on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton. The\n95% CL limits obtained are\n\u22120.052 < a\u03c4 < 0.013\n|d\u03c4 | < 3.7 * 10\u221216 e * cm.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are greatly indebted to our technical collaborators, to the members of the CERNSL Division for the excellent performance of the LEP collider, and to the funding agencies\nfor their support in building and operating the DELPHI detector.\nWe acknowledge in particular the support of\nAustrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, GZ 616.364/2-III/2a/98,\nFNRS\u2013FWO, Flanders Institute to encourage scientific and technological research in the\nindustry (IWT), Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural affairs (OSTC),\nBelgium,\nFINEP, CNPq, CAPES, FUJB and FAPERJ, Brazil,\nCzech Ministry of Industry and Trade, GA CR 202/99/1362,\nCommission of the European Communities (DG XII),\nDirection des Sciences de la Mati\u00e8re, CEA, France,\nBundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie, Germany,\nGeneral Secretariat for Research and Technology, Greece,\nNational Science Foundation (NWO) and Foundation for Research on Matter (FOM),\nThe Netherlands,\nNorwegian Research Council,\nState Committee for Scientific Research, Poland, SPUB-M/CERN/PO3/DZ296/2000,\nSPUB-M/CERN/PO3/DZ297/2000 and 2P03B 104 19 and 2P03B 69 23(2002-2004)\nJNICT\u2013Junta Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u0131\u0301fica e Tecnol\u00f3gica, Portugal,\nVedecka grantova agentura MS SR, Slovakia, Nr. 95/5195/134,\nMinistry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia,\nCICYT, Spain, AEN99-0950 and AEN99-0761,\n\n\f12\n\nThe Swedish Natural Science Research Council,\nParticle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, UK,\nDepartment of Energy, USA, DE-FG02-01ER41155,\nEEC RTN contract HPRN-CT-00292-2002.\nWe thank F.Cornet for providing the calculation of the cross-section of anomalous taupair production in two-photon collisions.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nOPAL Collaboration, R.
