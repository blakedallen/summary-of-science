He\nalso shows some interesting results on the overlap distribution P (q) at zero temperature. His conclusion is that\nat T = 0 and in the thermodynamical limit the P (q) is a\ndelta function. We would like to point out that his result\nis not in contradiction with ours and that none of the\nconclusions we reached in [2] is to be modified.\nIn our paper we already commented about the shrinking of the P (q) at T = 0, finding that the variance decreases like \u03c3 2 \u221d L\u22120.4 . However, because of the small\nexponent, we were not able to determine the asymptotic\nvalue of the variance from our data (L \u2264 1024) and we\nbelieve that even with Hartmann's data (L \u2264 2000) this\nextrapolation is still a hard task. Note that the relevant\nobservable is the width \u03c3 which scales with an exponent\nof order 0.2\u00f70.25, according to ours or Hartmann results.\nWe also measured [2] the width in the high temperature\nphase and we obtained \u03c3 \u221d L\u22120.5 as it should be according to the central limit theorem.\nNevertheless, assuming that according to [1] the model\nstudied in [2] at T = 0 has a delta-shaped P (q), our conclusions regarding the replica symmetry breaking (RSB)\ntransition will remain unaltered. Indeed there are disordered models which have an RSB phase together with\na trivial P (q) at T = 0, showing that the two properties are completely unrelated. The most famous among\nthese is the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) one [3], which\nis widely considered the prototype of disordered models.\nBelow the critical temperature the SK model has an RSB\nphase [4], however at T = 0 the P (q) is a delta function\ncentered in q = 1.\nAn expert reader may object that, differently from the\nSK model, the random RNA model we have studied in [2]\nhas a finite entropy at T = 0 and then the above argument may no longer hold. However we do not expect\nany significant difference and we corroborate our belief\nwith the most recent results on the Edwards-Anderson\n(EA) model with discrete couplings (\u00b1J) in dimensions\nd = 3, 4. In this model at T = 0 there is a finite entropy\nand a trivial delta-shaped P (q) [5], however as soon as\nthe temperature is different from zero the P (q) becomes\nbroad [6]. Moreover in the \u00b1J EA model, independently\nfrom the existence of a finite temperature phase transition (which is present in d = 3, 4 and absent in d = 2),\nthe P (q) at T = 0 is always a delta function [5]. If\none is interested in understanding the presence of a finite\ntemperature phase transition through the ground states\ncalculation, methods more sophisticated than the simple\nP (q) estimation should be used [6]. Their application to\n\nthe random RNA models studied in [2,7] would be very\nwelcome.\nThe above observations should clarify the importance\nof studying the model at finite temperatures, where a\nbroad P (q) indeed signals the presence of an RSB phase.\nWe presented the key results obtained at T 6= 0 in the\nthird figure of [2]. They show the existence of a phase\ntransition to a phase where the replica symmetry seems\nto be broken. Moreover in the discussion following Fig. 3\nin [2] we also took into account the possibility that the\nRSB would be simply given by finite size effects and that\nit would disappear in the thermodynamical limit. Even\nin this case the zero-energy excitations between different\n\"valleys\", which mimic the presence of RSB, would play\na fundamental role in the understanding of the model.\nFinally, in order to confirm the glassy nature of the\ntransition at finite temperature, we are currently implementing a Monte Carlo study of the model dynamics.\nPreliminary results clearly display typical glassy features,\nlike aging. We hope that these results will eventually render a coherent scenario of RSB both from dynamical and\nthermodynamical point of view.\n\nA. Pagnania, G. Parisib and F.
