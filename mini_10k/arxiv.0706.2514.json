The relationship between the length gauge (LG) and the velocity gauge\n(VG) exact forms of the photoionization probability amplitude is considered. Our\nmotivation for this paper comes from applications of the Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR)\ntheory, which describes atoms (or ions) in a strong laser field (in the nonrelativistic\napproach, in the dipole approximation). On the faith of a certain widely-accepted\nassumption, we present a simple proof that the well-known LG form of the exact\nphotoionization (or photodetachment) probability amplitude is indeed the gaugeinvariant result. In contrast, to obtain the VG form of this probability amplitude, one\nhas to either (i) neglect the well-known G\u00f6ppert-Mayer exponential factor (which\nassures gauge invariance) during all the time evolution of the ionized electron or (ii)\nput some conditions on the vector potential of the laser field.\n\nPACS numbers: 32.80.Rm, 42.50.Hz\n\nThe Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR) theory [1-4] describes nonresonant multiphoton processes\nsuch as above threshold detachment of ions and above threshold ionization of atoms in an\nintense electromagnetic (laser) field. This theory utilizes the S -matrix theory, which is in\nprinciple exact, but in practice one has to use approximate wavefunctions to evaluate the S matrix elements for bound-free transitions. This is due to non existence of the general\nanalytical solution to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE) for a charged particle\ninteracting with both an attractive potential (for example the Coulomb one) and an\nelectromagnetic plane-wave field even in the simplest case. In this paper we consider the\n\n\foutgoing nonrelativistic electron in the dipole (or long wavelength) approximation. The\nelectron is initially bound by any attractive potential. Similar assumptions about the electronic\nmotion were made in the pioneering papers [1-3,5], which utilize the Gordon-Volkov final\nstate wavefunctions [6,7]. These wavefunctions, which completely omit the attractive\npotential, are good enough only for sufficiently strong laser fields (particularly of circular\npolarization) [3,4]. Such simple description is not sufficient for each present-day strong-field\nionization or detachment experiment, including the numerical ones. However, any\ngeneralization of the KFR theory, accounting for magnetic-field component of the laser field\n[8] or relativistic effects, should reduce to the correct nonrelativistic dipole approximation\nlimit for lower radiation intensities. It was very well known long ago that the length gauge\n(LG) (used by Keldysh) and the velocity gauge (VG) (used by Reiss) theories give different\nresults (see, for example, [4,9-16]). Recently this problem attracted quite considerable interest\nas well [17-23], where some advantages of the LG theory over the VG one were mostly\nstressed. According to Frolov et al [24], the S -matrix approach does not take into account the\nlevel shifting (dynamic Stark effect) and the laser-induced level width of an initial state.\nLet us assume that the laser field (of any elliptical polarization), which is adiabatically\nturned on and off at asymptotic times ( t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e ) changes arbitrarily in time (in the KFR theory\na monochromatic laser field of constant amplitude is considered, but in this paper this\nr\ncondition is superfluous). The laser field can be described by the vector potential A (in the\nCoulomb gauge), for which one usually assumes that:\nr\nr\nlim A(t ) = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nt \u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nr\nThe lack of spatial dependence in the vector potential A(t ) means that the dipole\napproximation (which is roughly valid, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is much\nlarger than the atomic size, but see [8] for more details) has been applied. The magnetic-field\ncomponent of the laser field is zero and the electric-field component is given by\nr\nr\n1 \u2202A\nF (t ) = \u2212\n.\nc \u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nAt this place let us only note (see equation (2)) that the condition (1) is stronger than the\nr\nr\ncondition: lim F (t ) = 0 . The one-electron atom or ion in the laser field is described by the\nt \u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nfollowing Hamiltonian\n\n2\n\n\fH = HA + HI \u2261\n\nr\nr\np2\n+ V (r ) + H I ,\n2m\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H A is the atomic Hamiltonian, and the interaction Hamiltonian is given either in the\nrr\npA form:\n\nH IpA =\n\n\u2212e r r\ne2 r 2\nA(t ) ,\nA(t ) p +\nmc\n2mc 2\n\n(4)\n\nrr\nr\nr\n( e < 0 is the charge of an electron and p = \u2212ih\u2207 ) or in the dE form:\nrr\nH IdE = \u2212er F (t ) .\n\n(5)\n\nUsing the usual rules of quantum mechanics for both wavefunctions and operators ( \u03a8 ' = \u00db\u03a8 ,\nO\u02c6 ' = U\u02c6O\u02c6 U\u02c6 \u22121 ), the TDSE (for the atom in the laser field) can be transformed from either form\nto the other one by a certain unitary transformation. It is very well-known (see for instance\n[25-27]) that within the dipole approximation of the laser field the above mentioned two\nr\ndescriptions are equivalent. Let \u03a8 (r , t ) be the exact solution of the TDSE with the\nr\nHamiltonian (3) in either form, and \u03a6(r , t ) be the exact solution of the TDSE with the\nHamiltonian H A . If the subscripts i, f denote initial and final states, one can define two\nequivalent forms of the exact S -matrix:\n\n(\n)\n= lim (\u03a8 ( ) , \u03a6 ) ,\n\nS fi = lim \u03a6 f , \u03a8i(+ ) ,\nt \u2192+\u221e\n\nS fi\n\nt \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nf\n\n\u2212\n\ni\n\nwhere\nwhere\n\nlim \u03a8i(+ ) = \u03a6 i ,\n\n(6)\n\nlim \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) = \u03a6 f ,\n\n(7)\n\nt \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nt \u2192+\u221e\n\nwhich are called the direct time form and the reversed time form respectively (the round\nbrackets denote the overlap of two wavefunctions). In both papers [1,3] the latter one was\nutilized, so we will set about doing it. In this case including the boundary condition for\nt \u2192 +\u221e (the second of equations (7), see also Section 2 of [28]), one obtains\n\n3\n\n\f(S \u2212 1) fi = S fi \u2212 \u03b4 fi =\n\u221e\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nlim \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i \u2212 lim \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i =\n\nt \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\nt \u2192+\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u222b\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\n(\n\n\u2202 (\u2212 )\n\u03a8 ,\u03a6i\n\u2202t f\n\n)\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2202\n\uf8eb\u2202\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb1\n\uf8f6\n= \u2212 \u222b dt \uf8ec \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i \uf8f7 \u2212 \u222b dt \uf8ec \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i \uf8f7 = \u2212 \u222b dt \uf8ec (H A + H I )\u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i \uf8f7\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nih\n\uf8f8 \u2212\u221e \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\u2212\u221e \uf8ed\n\u2212\u221e \uf8ed\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(\n\n\u221e\n(\u2212 ) , 1 H \u03a6 \uf8f6 = \u2212 i dt \u03a8 (\u2212 ) , H \u03a6\nA i\uf8f7\nI i\nf\nih\nh \u2212\u222b\u221e\n\uf8f8\n\n\u222b dt \uf8ec\uf8ed \u03a8 f\n\n)\n, (8)\n\nwhere the hermiticity of H A and H I has been used. The crucial point of this paper is the\nfollowing observation: only in the LG equations (6), (7) are true probability amplitudes of\nionization (or detachment), if the wavefunctions \u03a6 f\n\nand \u03a6 i denote the \"textbook\"\n\nwavefunctions without any additional phase factors. There are two reasons which make us to\nthink so. The first one is the following. The asymptotic reference states should be eigenstates\nof the gauge-invariant energy operator in the absence of the laser field. In appendix we show\nthat this implies that only in the LG this asymptotic reference states have the form of the\n\"textbook\" wavefunctions \u03a6 f or \u03a6 i . To get the probability amplitude of ionization in the\nVG, first one has to transform these wavefunctions to this gauge according to\n\nr\nr\nr\n\u03a8 pA (r , t ) = U\u02c6 (r , t )\u03a8 dE (r , t ) ,\n\nwhere\n\nr\n\uf8eb ie r r \uf8f6\nU\u02c6 (r , t ) = exp\uf8ec r A(t )\uf8f7\n\uf8ed hc\n\uf8f8\n\n(9)\n\nis the G\u00f6ppert-Mayer unitary operator [29], which has just been mentioned above and which\nassures gauge invariance. This exponential operator transforms the TDSE with the\nHamiltonian (3) (both wavefunctions and operators) from the LG to the VG [25-27]. Necessity\nr\nr\nrr\nof multiplying the wavefunction \u03a8 pA (r , t ) by the operator U\u02c6 + (r , t ) = exp (\u2212 ie / hc )r A(t )\n\n(\n\n)\n\nbefore projecting on an eigenstate of the atomic Hamiltonian was already noticed by many\nauthors (which is the second reason of the two mentioned above) long ago. It took place in\nvarious contexts [30-42] (of course this list of references is not complete). In this way one\nobtains the overlap, which is gauge-invariant and can be treated as an instantaneous\nprobability amplitude of ionization (or detachment). This is equivalent to multiplying the\nr\nr\nwavefunction \u03a8 dE (r , t ) by the operator U\u02c6 (r , t ) , when working in the VG. For sufficiently\nr\nr\nweak electric fields described by A(t ) one can sometimes approach U\u02c6 (r , t ) by unity, but for\nr\nstrong fields putting U\u02c6 (r , t ) \u2245 1 is certainly not justified. For example, for the H(1s) atom, if\nr\nr \u2245 1 a.u. the exponent in equation (9) is of the order of i z1 , where z1 is the Reiss\n(dimensionless) intensity parameter [3].

(12)\n\nUsing equations (2), (5) and the hermiticity of H A , we can add the last three integrals in\nequation (12) and obtain\n\n(S \u2212 1) fi =\n\n((\n\n[\n\n]\n\n)\n\n)\n\n1 \u221e\ndt H IdE U\u02c6 + + U\u02c6 + , H A + U\u02c6 + H IpA \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) pA , \u03a6 i .\n\u222b\nih \u2212 \u221e\n\n(13)\n\nThe calculation of a commutator in the above equation is elementary and gives:\n\n[U\u02c6\n\n+\n\n]\n\n, H A = \u2212U\u02c6 + H IpA .\n\n(14)\n\nIn this way, after substitution of equation (14) into equation (13), the Hamiltonian H IpA\ndisappears from the S -matrix element in spite of making calculations in the VG. Finally,\nbecause H IdE is a hermitian operator, the exact probability amplitude of ionization takes the\nform\n\n5\n\n\f(S \u2212 1) fi =\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1 \u221e\n1 \u221e\ndE \u02c6 + (\u2212 ) pA\n,\n\u03a8\n\u03a6\n=\ndt\nH\nU\ndt \u03a8 (f\u2212 )dE , H IdE \u03a6 i ,\nI\ni\n\u222b\n\u222b\nf\nih \u2212 \u221e\nih \u2212 \u221e\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is identical with the LG result derived in equation (8). In this way, for the exact\nprobability amplitude of ionization, gauge invariance is preserved. By analogy, starting from\nequations (6) and (10) respectively, and making similar calculations, one can check, that the\ngauge-invariant direct time form of the S -matrix is the following\n\n(S \u2212 1) fi =\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1 \u221e\ndt \u03a6 f , H IdE \u03a8i(+ )dE .\nih \u2212\u222b\u221e\n\n(16)\n\nIn the light of the above calculations it is obvious that the well-known starting point of the VG\nKFR theory [3]\n\n(S \u2212 1) fi =\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1 \u221e\ndt \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) pA , H IpA \u03a6 i ,\n\u222b\nih \u2212 \u221e\n\n(17)\n\nis not always an exact expression. To obtain equation (17), for example, one has to put\nr\nU\u02c6 (r , t ) = 1 during all the time evolution of the ionized electron. This can be deduced from the\nfirst line of equation (12) (where we put U\u02c6 + = 1 ) and equation (8) (where we put H I = H IpA ).\nr\nHowever, as we have noted above, U\u02c6 (r , t ) = 1 is not satisfied in strong laser fields. Burlon et\nal [10] and Leone et al [11] long ago considered in fact the same problem (nonresonant\nmultiphoton ionization) in the S -matrix theory. With the help of some approximations done in\nthe Green function representation of the S -matrix element they arrived at the same\nr\nconclusion. They found that if one puts U\u02c6 (r , t ) = 1 for all t then one obtains equation (17).\nBurlon et al and Leone et al found that ionization rates based on equation (17) may depart by\norders of magnitude from gauge-invariant ionization rates at the same level of accuracy in an\nanalytical approximation to \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) .\nBut there is another way of obtaining equation (17). If one assumes that the condition\n(1) is fulfilled then\nlim U\u02c6 = 1 ,\n\nt \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\n\nand\n\nlim U\u02c6 + = 1 .\n\nt \u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\n6\n\n(18)\n\n\fIf so, one can drop U\u02c6 and U\u02c6 + in all the equations (10), (11). Hence the ionization probability\namplitudes (17) and (15) become equal. Of course, the respective direct time probability\namplitudes of ionization become equal in this case too. The supposition, that for the accurate\nwavefunctions the LG and the VG KFR theories would give identical results, was called\n\"strong gauge invariance\" (see [4], p. 20). We have just shown that this is true, if the vector\npotential of the laser field vanishes at asymptotic times. The latter condition implies (equations\n(1), (2)) that\n\u221e\n\nr\nF\n\u222b (t )dt = 0 ,\n\n(19)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich is valid for a laser pulse [41] (see also [43], p. R165).\nBy the way, let us note that the well-known result for the atomic photoeffect (for more\ndetails see [44,45]) can be deduced as a conclusion from our considerations. For such process\nonly one photon of energy h\u03c9 > E B ( E B > 0 - binding energy) is absorbed and the ionizing\nradiation is so weak, that it can be treated as a perturbation. Therefore one can substitute\nr\nU\u02c6 (r , t ) = 1 for all t , obtaining from equation (8)\n\n(S \u2212 1) fi =\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n1 \u221e\n1 \u221e\ndt \u03a8 (f\u2212 )dE , H IdE \u03a6 i =\ndt \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) pA , H IpA \u03a6 i .\n\u222b\n\u222b\nih \u2212 \u221e\nih \u2212 \u221e\n\n(20)\n\nIn the dipole approximation, in the limit of very low radiation intensities, in the exact\nr\nr\nwavefunctions \u03a8 (f\u2212 )dE = \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) pA one can put A(t ) = 0 , so they contain no laser field. Thereby\nboth of them become stationary Coulomb waves (of positive total energy, with an asymptotic\nv\nmomentum p as a parameter), which are orthogonal to \u03a6 i . As a result, one obtains that the\nr\nVG S -matrix element (the A 2 term may be neglected) and the LG S -matrix element are\nidentical, so the respective cross sections also do, if we use the accurate atomic wavefunctions.\nOf course, from the practical point of view, the much more interesting question is what\ngauge we should choose, if the Volkov wavefunction is used for the final continuum atomic\nstate, instead of the exact wavefunction. This problem does not have any general solution for\ntoday, but there are several examples (see section VI of [21]) showing that the approximate S matrix theory in the version of Keldysh (LG) is in many cases better than the analogical\napproximate S -matrix theory in the version of Reiss (VG). The Keldysh theory is usually\nmore accurate, but sometimes it may be even the only one, which is in qualitative agreement\n\n7\n\n\fwith the results of numerical solution to the TDSE [19]. In the low-frequency-high-intensity\nlimit ionization rates calculated in the Keldysh theory for the H(1s) atom are always closer to\nother theoretical results than their counterparts calculated in the Reiss theory (we refer the\nreader to our recent papers [21,23] for more details). In the recent experiment of Buerke and\nMeyerhofer [46] ionization rate of He+ (1s) in the circularly polarized laser field of very low\nfrequency \u03c9 \u2245 0.043 a.u. ( \u03bb \u2245 1.053 \u03bcm ; we use atomic units here: h = e = me = 1) has been\nmeasured with the relative error of roughly 35% . The only KFR result, which is in\nquantitative agreement with this measurement, is the WKB Coulomb corrected Keldysh\nionization rate, which is about 15% larger [23]. For the H(1s) atom in an arbitrary static\nelectric field (of strength F ) ionization rate can be computed exactly by using the complex\nscaling method [47,48]. In the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 , for the circularly polarized laser field, the above\nthreshold ionization rates should approach a limit of exact static field ionization rates. One\nmay also expect that in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 , for the linearly polarized laser field, the above\nthreshold ionization rates would approach a limit of exact static field ionization rates averaged\nover one field period. For the Floquet theory the last two statements have been confirmed\n(with some provision regarding intermediate resonances for linear polarization) for not too\nstrong fields [49]. In a way the fact that for the H(1s) atom in the linearly polarized lowfrequency laser field ionization rate can be treated as a cycle-averaged static-field ionization\nrate has been confirmed in ab initio simulations for F \u2265 0.1 a.u. (roughly) and frequencies\n0.0456 a.u. \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 0.182 a.u. (see figure 2 and the discussion in [47]). We expect the same\nfor the correct KFR theory, at least approximately (because in practice the KFR theory can be\nonly approximate), in the limit of strong fields ( z1 \u2192 \u221e ).\nIn figure 1 we compare the Keldysh and the Reiss ionization rates (as a function of the\nelectric field strength F ) for the circularly polarized laser field of frequency \u03c9 = 0.01 a.u.\nwith the exact static field results of Scrinzi et al [47,48]. There is a very considerable\ndifference, up to more than six orders of magnitude, between the Keldysh and the Reiss\ntheories for the strongest fields shown in figure 1 ( F = 1 a.u. corresponds to z1 = 20000 ,\nwhich is beyond the conventional applicability limit of the nonrelativistic theory, the latter\nbeing at z f = 2U P / c 2 = 0.1 [3], which corresponds to F \u2245 0.433 a.u. ). As expected, the\ngauge-invariant Keldysh theory, which utilizes the Volkov wavefunction (without any\nCoulomb corrections; equation (27) of [21] describes ionization rate in this case) improves\nwith increasing intensity. In contrast, the Reiss theory gives unexpected decreasing values of\nionization rate above F \u2245 0.2 a.u. For the highest intensities shown in figure 1 the Keldysh\n\n8\n\n\fionization rates are able to reproduce the exact static field ionization rates within the factor of\n2. Ionization rates of Landau [50] (see also equation (1) of [21], which become accurate in the\nlimit F \u2192 0 ) are also shown for comparison in figure 1. In figure 2 we show analogous\nionization rates, but for linear polarization ( F = 1 a.u. corresponds to z1 = 10000 , and\nz f = 0.1 corresponds to F \u2245 0.613 a.u. ). Static field ionization rates have been averaged\nover one field period (equation (2) of [21] describes the averaged Landau result). To this end\nwe have made the B-splines interpolation of the exact static field results of Scrinzi et al\n[47,48] and then we have numerically calculated the respective integral (these averaged exact\nstatic field ionization rates are shown analogically by full circles, as in figure 1). In figure 2\nthe Keldysh ionization rates (equation (20) of [1]) approach the averaged exact static field\nionization rates with increasing intensity. In contrast, the Reiss ionization rates remain at least\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than one could expect, even for very strong fields.\nIn our opinion, the qualitative difference (particularly distinct for circular polarization)\nbetween the Keldysh and the Reiss theories in the low-frequency-high-intensity limit, is\nconnected with the matter of gauge invariance. When calculating the probability amplitude of\n\n(\n\n)\n\nionization in the S -matrix theory, one integrates the time derivative of the overlap \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i ,\nwhich is a function of time. As equation (8) clearly shows, this integration is performed from\n\n(\n\n)\n\nthe point t = +\u221e , where we know the overlap: \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) , \u03a6 i = \u03b4 fi , to the point t = \u2212\u221e , where\nthis overlap is (analytically) unknown. To obtain an approximate result, we approach the value\nof the integrand for all times between t = +\u221e and t = \u2212\u221e by using the Volkov wavefunction\nr\nr\ninstead of \u03a8 (f\u2212 ) . But for any time t obeying + \u221e > t > \u2212\u221e and A(t ) \u2260 0 the overlap\n\n(\u03a8 ( )\n(\u03a8 ( )\nf\n\nf\n\n\u2212 dE\n\n\u2212 pA\n\n) is the instantaneous probability amplitude of ionization and the overlap\nr\nr\n, \u03a6 ) is not. These two expressions are equal only when A(t ) = 0 . Therefore only in\n\n, \u03a6i\n\ni\n\nthe LG our approximation has a clear physical interpretation for all t , which contribute to the\nanalytical value of the integral.\nIn conclusion, on the faith of a widely-accepted assumption, by a straightforward\nanalytical calculation based on the TDSE, we have shown that the LG form of the exact S matrix element (describing ionization in a strong laser field) is in fact the gauge-invariant\nform. This assumption says that having the solution of the TDSE in the VG, one has to\nrr\nmultiply it by the factor of exp (\u2212 ie / hc )r A(t ) before projecting it on an eigenstate of the\n\n(\n\n)\n\natomic Hamiltonian (and no additional factor is needed in the LG). In this paper traditionally\nwe were using the name of \"the VG form of the exact S -matrix element\" for equation (17).\n\n9\n\n\fr\nWe have shown, that in fact one should rather use this name for equation (15), where F (t ) is\nr\nexpressed through A(t ) . The S -matrix element from equation (17) can be equal to its\ncounterpart from equation (15), if one of the two following conditions is fulfilled: (i) the\nG\u00f6ppert-Mayer exponential factor is approximated by unity during all the time evolution of\nthe ionized electron or (ii) the vector potential of the laser field vanishes at asymptotic times.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is extremely grateful to Professor Piotr Kosi\u0144ski for numerous interesting\nand enlightening discussions and remarks connected with this paper, and for reading the\nmanuscript.

Here we put forward an independent argument for the form of the asymptotic\nreference states, which appear in the S -matrix element. From self-evident reasons some\nquantities in this appendix have a different notation.\nIf a total duration time of a laser pulse is 2\u03c4 , the following electromagnetic field\nr\nr r\nr\ninteracts with an atom in the dipole approximation: the magnetic field B(r , t ) \u2261 0 (for all r , t )\nr r\nr\nr\nr\nand the electric field E (r , t ) \u2261 F (t ) (for all r , t , where F (t ) is a certain real continuous\nr\nr\nr\nr r r\n1 \u2202A\n,\nfunction vanishing outside the time interval [\u2212 \u03c4 ,\u03c4 ] ). Since B = \u2207 \u00d7 A and E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 \u2212\nc \u2202t\nthe most general vector and scalar potentials describing these fields are\nr r\nr r\nA(r , t ) = \u2207\u03c7 (r , t ) ,\n\nand\n\nr r 1 \u2202 r\nr\n\u03c6 (r , t ) = \u2212 F (t )r \u2212\n\u03c7 (r , t ) ,\nc \u2202t\n\n10\n\n(A1)\n\n\fr\nwhere \u03c7 (r , t ) is an arbitrary real differentiable gauge function. Of course, physical predictions\nformulated in any particular gauge \u03c7 should not depend on \u03c7 . Utilizing the well-known\nusual procedure of the minimal electromagnetic coupling, we write\n\nH\u03c7 =\n\n2\n1 \uf8eb r e r\uf8f6\n\uf8ec p \u2212 A \uf8f7 + eV + e\u03c6 ,\n2m \uf8ed\nc \uf8f8\n\nand\n\nih\n\nr\nr\n\u2202\n\u03a8\u03c7 (r , t ) = H \u03c7 \u03a8\u03c7 (r , t ) .\n\u2202t\n\n(A2)\n\nThe gauge-dependent total Hamiltonian of the atom in the laser field H \u03c7 determines the time\n\nr\nevolution of the electronic wavefunction in the TDSE. In equations (A2) V = V (r ) is the\nr\nbinding potential (for example the Coulomb one), and A, \u03c6 are given by equations (A1). The\nwell-known relationship exists between Hamiltonians and wavefunctions in different gauges\n[25-27]. In particular, if one of the gauge functions is zero (we put the index \"0\" for\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261 0 ) we have\nr\nr\ne \u2202 r\n\u03c7 (r , t ) ,\nH \u03c7 = exp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc )H 0 exp(\u2212 ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) \u2212\nc \u2202t\n(A3)\nand\n\nr\nr\nr\n\u03a8\u03c7 (r , t ) = \u03a80 (r , t ) exp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) .\n\nIf equations (A3) are satisfied, all the TDSE equations (A2), for different gauge functions\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) , are equivalent.\nr\nr\nNow let us consider the limits t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e , where F (t ) is zero, but \u03c7 (r , t ) - not necessary!\nWhen the laser field is off, the Hamiltonian H \u03c7 is equal to H \u03c7atom . The latter one is given by\nr\nr\nequations (A1), (A2) and the condition F (t ) \u2261 0 . H \u03c7atom is gauge-dependent and its\neigenvalues are also gauge-dependent, so this Hamiltonian should not define initial or final\nreference states. This is the term\n\ne \u2202 r\n\u03c7 (r , t ) , which breaks gauge invariance in the first\nc \u2202t\n\nequation (A3). Instead, the gauge-invariant (in a sense described below) energy operator \u03b5\nshould be used to define these states. The energy operator \u03b5 is a sum of the kinetic and\nr\npotential energy operators and \u03b5 0 = H 0atom = p 2 / 2m + eV in the gauge defined by\n\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261 0 . In the arbitrary gauge one can obtain this operator from H 0atom by the relation\n\n11\n\n\f2\nr\nr\n1 \uf8ebr e r r \uf8f6\natom\n\u03b5 \u03c7 = exp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc )H 0 exp(\u2212 ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) =\n\uf8ec p \u2212 \u2207\u03c7 (r , t )\uf8f7 + eV .\n2m \uf8ed\nc\n\uf8f8\n\n(A4)\n\nr\nr\nSuppose that in the following eigenequation: \u03b5 0 \u03a6 0 (r , t ) = E\u03a6 0 (r , t ) E (the total energy) is a\ncertain real eigenvalue of \u03b5 0 . Transforming this eigenequation (using equation (A4) and the\nr\nr\nr\nr\nequation: \u03a6 \u03c7 (r , t ) = \u03a6 0 (r , t ) exp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) ) to the arbitrary gauge \u03c7 (r , t ) one obtains\nr\nr\n\u03b5 \u03c7 \u03a6 \u03c7 (r , t ) = E\u03a6 \u03c7 (r , t ) .\n\n(A5)\n\nTherefore the eigenvalue E remains the same in all gauges, and this is why we call the energy\noperator \u03b5 \u03c7 (or \u03b5 in brief) gauge-invariant. Although it depends on the gauge function\n\nr\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) , equation (A5) holds true for any \u03c7 (r , t ) . To define both equivalent forms (the direct\ntime and the reversed time) of the exact S -matrix, we need the initial and final ( i, f )\nasymptotic reference states (see equations (6), (7)), which should obey equations of the type\n(A5) in the arbitrary gauge. In the photoionization or photodetachment process bound-free\ntransitions occur, so E i < 0 and E f > 0 . From the above discussion it follows clearly that\n\nr\nchoosing the initial and final states as eigenstates of H 0atom = p 2 / 2m + eV corresponds to the\nr\ngauge defined by \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261 0 . In other gauges the initial and final states take the form:\n\n(rr, t ) = \u03a6 initial\n(rr, t ) exp(ie\u03c7 (rr, t ) / hc ) ,\n\u03a6 initial\n0\n\u03c7\n(A6)\nr\nr\nr\n\u03a6 \u03c7final (r , t ) = \u03a6 0final (r , t ) exp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) ,\n\n(rr, t ) and \u03a6 0final (rr, t ) are the well-known \"textbook\" wavefunctions (for\nwhere \u03a6 initial\n0\nr\nexample the Coulomb ones). They are products of some functions of r only and the\n\n(\n\n)\n\nexponential factor exp(\u2212 iEi t / h ) or exp \u2212 iE f t / h respectively. In the definitions of the S matrix elements in equations (6) and (7) there are two different limits t \u2192 \u2212\u221e and t \u2192 +\u221e .\nr\nTherefore it follows from equations (A6) that in the arbitrary gauge \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261/ 0 one may not\nsimply drop the time evolution (from \u2212 \u221e\nr\nexp(ie\u03c7 (r , t ) / hc ) .\n\nto\n\n+ \u221e or reversely) of the factor\n\nr\nFinally, it follows from equations (A1) and (A2) that the gauge defined by \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261 0 is\nthe LG, because the total Hamiltonian of the atom in the laser field takes the form:\n\n12\n\n\fr r\nr\nr\nr\nH 0 = p 2 / 2m + eV (r ) \u2212 eF (t )r . On the other hand, one can choose the gauge function \u03c7 (r , t )\nsuch that \u2212\n\nr r\n1 \u2202 r\n\u03c7 (r , t ) = F (t )r (this condition defines some infinite set of gauge functions\nc \u2202t\n\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261/ 0 ), obtaining\n\nr\nr t r\nr\n\u03c7 (r , t ) = \u2212cr \u222b F (t \u2032)dt \u2032 + g (r ) ,\n\n(A7)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nr\nwhere g (r ) is an arbitrary function. Substituting this into equations (A6) and utilizing the\nr\ndefinition of F (t ) one obtains\n\n(rr, t ) = \u03a6 initial\n(rr, t ) exp(ieg (rr ) / hc )\n\u03a6 initial\n0\n\u03c7\n\nfor t < \u2212\u03c4 ;\n(A8)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nr\nr\nr\u03c4 r\nr\n\u03a6 \u03c7final (r , t ) = \u03a6 0final (r , t ) exp\uf8ec \u2212 (ie / h )r \u222b F (t \u2032)dt \u2032 + ieg (r ) / hc \uf8f7 for t > \u03c4 .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212\u03c4\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\nr\nFrom equations (A8) it is obvious that in the gauge \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261/ 0 the initial and final reference\nstates usually acquire different exponential factors (multiplying the \"textbook\" wavefunctions)\nr\nwith phases, which do not vanish even at t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e . Moreover, for an arbitrary function F (t ) ,\nphases at + \u221e and \u2212 \u221e are different, unless\n\u03c4\n\nr\n\nr\n\n\u222b F (t )dt = 0\n\n.\n\n(A9)\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nr\nr\nrr\nIt follows from equations (A1) and (A2) that the gauge given by \u03c7 (r , t ) = r A(t ) (where A(t ) is\nr\ndefined by the function F (t ) and equation (2)) is the VG, because the total Hamiltonian of the\n\n(\n\nr\nr\natom in the laser field takes the form H \u03c7 = p \u2212 eA(t ) / c\n\n)2 / 2m + eV (rr ) . Switching off the\n\nvector potential at asymptotic times (equation (1)), that one has to do in the S -matrix\nformalism, is possible only when equation (A9) is satisfied.\nThere is a proof (which does not utilize the dipole approximation) in appendix A of [52]\nshowing that for any finite laser pulse the condition (A9) is satisfied everywhere inside the\nlaser cavity. This constraint on the electric field of a laser pulse has been derived from the\nr\nrr\nMaxwell equations provided that \u2207P = 0 ( P denotes the polarization of the laser medium),\n\n13\n\n\fwhat is true to a good approximation [53]. Our paper shows that Eq. (A9) is also the necessary\ncondition on which the (usually) so-called exact VG probability amplitude is equal to the\n(usually) so-called exact LG probability amplitude (equation (20)). But the latter one is in fact\nthe gauge-invariant result, which does not need any additional conditions, like (A9), to be\nvalid. Perhaps in the real experimental conditions of strong laser field the condition (A9) could\nbe satisfied only approximately ( 0 <\n\n\u03c4\n\nr\n\nr\n<< 2\u03c4 max F (t ) ) and the additional phase which\n\n\u222b F (t )dt\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nappears in the second of equations (A8) could not be neglected. Then the initial and final\nr\nreference states (see equations (A8)) would have different phases in any gauge \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261/ 0 .\nThis would be the source of a certain additional error not connected with any analytical\napproximations in the S -matrix theory. Only the gauge-invariant S -matrix element\nr\n(equations (15) and (16)), which is equivalent to the one with \u03c7 (r , t ) \u2261 0 , does not have this\ndrawback.\n\nReferences\n[1] Keldysh L V 1964 Zh.
