We show that the answer to this question\ncan be given in two alternative, although complementary, ways. The answer posed in this letter\nexplains satisfactorily the seemingly contradictory results obtained in different experiments, and\ntheoretical approaches.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Mn, 42.50.Dv, 42.65.Lm\n\nWithin the paraxial quantum optics regime, the orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) provides an useful description of the spatial degree of freedom of photons. Photons\nwhose spatial waveform contains an azimuthal phase dependence of the form \u223c exp (im\u03c6), carry an OAM of\nm~ per photon [1]. Photons with diverse spatial waveforms can be easily generated, detected, and controlled.\nTherefore, the OAM offers a physical resource where to\nexplore deeper quantum features not present in the 2dimensional Hilbert space addressed when using the polarization [2, 3]. Indeed, it allows to readily tailor the\nnumber of effective dimensions of the Hilbert space [4].\nDuring the last few years, several quantum features\nbased on the capacity of the OAM of photons to go beyond a 2-D Hilbert space have been demonstrated (see\n[5] and references inside) using spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC). These include the demonstration of the violation of bipartite, three dimensional Bell\ninequalities [6], the implementation of the so called quantum coin tossing protocol with qutrits [7], and the generation of quantum states in ultra-high dimensional spaces\n[8].\nAll of these experiments make use of the existence of\nspecific quantum OAM correlations between the two entangled photons generated in the SPDC process. Several\nexperiments [2, 9, 10, 11] seems to support the validity of\nthe selection rule mp = m1 + m2 , where mp ~ is the OAM\nper photon of the classical pump beam, and m1 and m2\nare the winding numbers of the modes into which the\nquantum state of the signal and idler photons are projected, respectively. Some other experiments [12, 13, 14],\nwhile not directly measuring the OAM of the downconverted photons, demonstrate the existence of ellipticity\nof the spatial waveform , which should make possible the\ndetection of photons with mp 6= m1 + m2 . Under some\nrestrictive conditions, the selection rule mp = m1 + m2\ncan be derived from first principles [4, 15, 16], although,\nas it will be shown below, the same rule address differ-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: juan.perez@icfo.es\n\nent physical quantities. The presence of Poynting vector\nwalk-off can also strongly modify OAM correlations [17].\nAll this raises the question of what are the OAM correlations between the downconverted photons generated in\nSPDC, i.e., under which conditions the OAM of the entangled photons fulfill the selection rule mp = m1 + m2 .\nHere we show that this question can be formulated in\ntwo complementary scenarios, so that in each scenario\nthe sough-after OAM correlations can be different. The\nexistence of previous apparently contradictory results is\ndue to the fact that the sought-after OAM correlations\nare different.\nIn one scenario, the spatial properties of all the pairs\nof photons generated are considered, therefore the global\nmode function is obtained adding coherently all such possibilities. In another scenario, which is relevant for current experimental applications, a small section of the full\ndown-conversion cone is considered. Only certain probability amplitudes are now considered. Under these conditions, the non-collinear SPDC geometry and the presence\nof spatial walk-off can greatly modify the OAM correlations observed.\nWe consider a nonlinear crystal of length L, illuminated by a monochromatic laser pump beam propagating in the z direction, with frequency \u03c9p . The spatial\nshape of the pump beam at the input face of the nonlinear crystal (z = 0), in the transverse wavevector \u0001domain,\nwrites Ep+ (p\u0304) = E0 (p\u0304x + ip\u0304y )mp exp \u2212|p\u0304|2 w02 /4 , which\ncorresponds to a beam which carries an OAM of mp ~ per\nphoton. E0 is a normalizing constant, p\u0304 = (p\u0304x , p\u0304y ) is the\ntransverse wavevector and w0 is the beam width. The\nsignal and idler photons are assumed to be monochromatic, with \u03c9s = \u03c9i = \u03c9p /2, where \u03c9s,i are the frequencies of the signal and idler photons. This is justified by\nthe use of narrow-band interference filters in front of the\ndetectors.\nThe photons are known to be generated into cones,\nwhose shape is determined by the phase matching conditions inside the crystal. For the sake of clarity, let us\nconsider first noncritical, i.e. negligible walk-off, noncollinear SPDC in a periodically poled nonlinear crystal.\nThe angle of the down conversion cone is assumed to be\n\n\f2\nsmall, so that the polarization [18] and refractive index do\nnot show noticeable changes with the direction of propagation. Similarly, the nonlinear coefficient is assumed to\nbe constant along the down-conversion cone.\nThe SPDC process can be described in the interaction picture\nby an effective Hamiltonian given by [19]\nR\nHI = \u01eb0 V dV \u03c7(2) Ep+ Es\u2212 Ei\u2212 + c.c, where Es\u2212 (x, z, t) \u221d\nR\ndKs dP exp (\u2212iP * x \u2212 iKs z + i\u03c9s t) a\u2020 (Ks , P) refers to\nthe negative-frequency part of the signal electric field operators. Similarly for the idler photon. The two-photon\nquantum state |\u03a8i at the output face of the nonlinear\ncrystal, within the first\norder perturbation theory, can\nR\nbe written as |\u03a8i = dPdQ \u03a6 (P, Q) a\u2020s (P) a\u2020i (Q) |0, 0i,\nwhere P and Q are the transverse wavevector for the signal and the idler respectively, and the mode function \u03a6\nis given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206k L\n\u03a6 (P, Q) = Ep (P + Q) sinc\n2\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2206k L\n+ i [Ks (P) + Ki (Q)] L\n(1)\nexp i\n2\nwhere \u2206k = Kp (P + Q)\u2212 Ks (P)\u2212 Ki (Q), the waveveci1/2\nh\n2\ntors (j = s, i, p) write Kj (P) = (\u03c9j nj /c) \u2212 |P|2\n,\ndepends on the modulus of the corresponding transverse\nwavevectors, and nj are the corresponding refractive index. The mode function of the biphoton in the spatial\ndomain (x1 , x2 ) is the spatial Fourier transform of the\nmode function given by Eq. (1).\nWe can write |P + Q|2 = \u03c12s + \u03c12i + 2\u03c1s \u03c1i cos (\u03c6s \u2212 \u03c6i ),\nwhere \u03c1s = |P|, and \u03c6s = tan\u22121 Py /Px are the\nmodulus and phase of the transverse wave vector P\nin cylindrical coordinates. For the idler photon we\nhave, similarly, \u03c1i = |Q| and \u03c6i = tan\u22121 Qy /Qx .\nOne can write sinc (\u2206k L/2) exp (i\u2206k L/2)\n=\nP\n\u221e\nH\n(\u03c1\n,\n\u03c1\n)\nexp\n{il\n(\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n)}.\nK\ndepends\nl\ns\ni\ns\ni\ns,i\nl=\u2212\u221e\non the moduli \u03c1s,i , respectively. The pump beam can\nalso be written as\n( \u0002\n\u0003 )\n\u03c12s + \u03c12i + \u03c1s \u03c1i cos (\u03c6s \u2212 \u03c6i ) w02\nEp = E0 exp \u2212\n4\n\u0013\n\u0012\nmp\nX\nmp\nm \u2212l\n\u03c1ls \u03c1i p exp {il\u03c6s + i (mp \u2212 l) \u03c6i } (2)\n\u00d7\nl\nl=0\n\nTherefore, the mode function given by Eq. (1) can be\nwritten as\n\u03a6 (P, Q) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nGm (\u03c1s , \u03c1i ) exp [im\u03c6s + i (mp \u2212 m) \u03c6i ]\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n(3)\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from Eq. (3) is that,\nif polarization, refractive index and nonlinear coefficient\nshow negligible azimuthal variations around the downconversion cone, the OAM correlations of the spatial\nwaveform of the biphoton state fulfill mp = m1 + m2 [15].\nImportantly, this result requires considering the whole\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of a non-collinear SPDC. (a)\nTop view of the non-collinear configuration. (b) The downconversion cone.\n\nspatial waveform of the downconverted photons, i.e. the\nfull down-conversion cone. Notwithstanding, these are\nnot the OAM correlations that typical quantum information experiments based on spatial entanglement measure.\nAn experiment aimed at detecting the global OAM of\nthe downconverted photons is a significant experimental\nchallenge that it is yet to be solved.\nAll relevant experiments reported to date detect only\na small section of the full down conversion cone. In\nother words, the wave vectors of the signal and idler\nphotons belong to a narrow bundle around the corresponding central wavevectors, i.e. P = P0 + \u2206P and\nQ = Q0 + \u2206Q. As shown in Fig. 1, the signal photon propagate along the direction \u1e911 with longitudinal\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nwavevector ks (p) = (ws ns /c) 2 \u2212 |p|2\n, and transverse wavevector p = (px , py ), so that \u2206Px = px and\n\u2206Py = cos \u03b81 py \u2212 sin \u03b81 ks . And similarly for the idler\nphoton, which propagates in the direction \u1e912 with longitudinal wavevector ki (q), and transverse wavevector q,\nso that \u2206Qx = qx and \u2206Qy = cos \u03b82 qy \u2212 sin \u03b82 ki . We\nrestrict ourselves to the case \u03b81 = \u2212\u03b82 = \u03b8.\nThe quantum state of\ncos \u03b8 can\nR the biphoton at z1 = L/\n+\n(p)\na\n(q)\n|0, 0i,\nbe written as |\u03c8i = dpdq \u03a6 (p, q) a+\ns\ni\nwhere the mode function writes [20]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4k L\n\u03a6 (p, q) = Ep (px + qx , \u03b40 ) sinc\n2\n\u001b\n\u001a\nL\n\u03b4k L\n(4)\n+ i [ks (p) + ki (q)]\nexp i\n2\ncos \u03b8\nwhere \u03b4k = kp \u2212 (ks + ki ) cos \u03b8 \u2212 (py \u2212 qy ) sin \u03b8 and \u03b40 =\n(py + qy ) cos \u03b8 \u2212 (ks + ki ) sin \u03b8.\nThe mode function given by Eq. (4) shows ellipticity in\nthe (p, q) domain, as has been demonstrated experimentally [12, 14]. An increasing degree of ellipticity of the\nspatial mode function enhances the quantum probability\namplitude of paired photons with mp 6= m1 + m2 . To get\nfurther insight in the nature of the OAM correlations, let\nus consider that the idler photon is projected into a gaussian mode (m2 = 0), so that the quantum state of the\nsignal photon\n\u0001 mode function\nR is described by the reduced\n\u03a6s (p) \u221d dq\u03a6 (p, q) exp \u2212|q|2 w12 /4 , where w1 is the\nbeam width of the idler mode.

Both photons traverse\n2-f systems. The idler photon is detected with q = 0. (a)\nTotal weight of the OAM modes with m1 6= 0, as a function\nof the pump beam width (w0 ). The label designate the noncollinear angle. (b) and (c) OAM mode distribution for \u03c6 =\n1\u25e6 for two values of the pump beam width: w0 = 100\u03bcm, and\nw0 = 1000\u03bcm.\n\ncontent of the signal photon, one has to project the spatial mode function into spiral harmonics exp (im\u03c6). The\nweights for each m of such decomposition gives us the\nsought-after OAM decomposition [3].\nFig. 2(a) shows the total weight corresponding to\nOAM modes with m1 6= 0, which is a measure of the degree of violation of the selection rule mp = m1 + m2 , for\ndifferent values of the non-collinear angle and the pump\nbeam width. Notice that the larger the non-collinear angle \u03b8, and the smaller the pump beam width w0 , the\nlarger is the probability to detect signal photons with\nm1 6= 0. Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) show two OAM distributions for \u03b8 = 1\u25e6 , one which shows an OAM distribution\nwith modes with m1 6= 0, while the other shows a single\npeak for m1 = 0.\nThe strength of the violation of the selection rule\nmp = m1 + m2 can be quantified through the noncollinear length [17] Lnc = w0 / sin \u03c6. If the crystal length\nis much smaller than the non-collinear length (L \u226a Lnc ),\nthe ellipticity of the mode function is small, and thus the\nselection rule mp = m1 + m2 is fulfilled. This turns out\nto be the case of nearly all of the experiments that make\nuse of the OAM of photons [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Typical non-collinear angles and crystal lengths used in these\nexperiments are \u03b8 \u2243 1 \u2212 2\u25e6 and L \u2243 1 \u2212 5 mm. For\nw0 = 500\u03bcm, one obtains Lnc \u2243 15 \u2212 30 mm, so that\nL < Lnc . On the contrary, if L \u2265 Lnc , strong departures\nfrom the selection rule mp = m1 + m2 are expected. This\n\nis the experimental configuration in [12, 13, 14], due to\nthe use of a highly focused pump beam or longer crystals.\nFor w0 = 90\u03bcm and \u03b8 = 2\u25e6 , one has Lnc \u2243 2.5 mm.\nAccording to Eq. (3), the OAM of the spatially entangled photons fulfill the relationship mp = m1 + m2 ,\nwhile Fig. 2 shows that strong departures from this selection rule can be observed if highly focused pump beams,\nhighly non-collinear configurations or longer nonlinear\ncrystals are used. Actually, we are describing the same\nquantum process in two complementary scenarios. Fig.\n2 would give us the OAM correlations measured in typical experiments that use the OAM as physical resource\nfor quantum information, thus it is relevant for experimental configurations currently used. In this scenario,\nthe fulfillment of the condition mp = m1 + m2 depends\non the pump beam width and the non-collinear angle, as\ndictated by the interplay between the non-collinear and\ncrystal lengths.\nOn the other hand, Eq.\n(3) corresponds to a\nglobal view of the SPDC process, where the full downconversion cone is considered. The question of angular\nmomentum conservation balance in SPDC requires the\nsimultaneous consideration of the angular momentum of\nthe electronic spins and orbitals, the crystalline structure\nof the nonlinear crystal and of the electromagnetic field\n[21]. The analysis presented here might be an important\nstep towards clarifying how angular momentum is effectively conserved, since to evaluate conservation laws, one\nshould take into account all probabilities amplitudes that\ncontribute to the quantum process.\nAnother important effect that might modify the OAM\ncorrelations is the presence of Poynting vector walk-off in\nsome, or all, of the interacting waves. In type I and type\nII SPDC configurations, some of the interacting waves are\nextraordinary waves, thus show Poynting vector walk-off.\nFor the sake of simplicity, let us consider a type I configuration, where only the pump beam presents spatial\nwalk-off. An initially gaussian pump beam, at each position z inside the nonlinear crystal can be decomposed\ninto spiral harmonics as\n\u001a\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u001b\nw0\nz\nEp (\u03c1p , z) = E0 exp \u2212\u03c12p\n+i 0\n4\n2kp\n\u221e\nX\n\u00d7\nJn (z\u03c1p tan \u03c10 ) exp {in\u03c6p }\n(5)\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the spatial walk-off angle, \u03c6p the azimuthal\nangle in cylindrical coordinates and Jn are Bessel functions of the first kind, and kp0 is the longitudinal wavevector. As shown in Fig. 3, the OAM distribution of the\npump beam increases its width with distance z. A gaussian beam incident from air into the nonlinear crystal is\nno longer a gaussian beam, i.e. the pump beam is no\nlonger a wave with mp = 0.\nThis effect becomes noticeable only if L > Lw , where\nthe walk length writes Lw = w0 / tan \u03c10 . Fig. 3(a) shows\nthe initial OAM distribution of a gaussian beam, which\ncorresponds to a single peak with mp = 0. Figs 3(b) and\n\n\f4\n\nwhere \u2206k = kp (P + Q) + (Px + Qx ) tan \u03c10 \u2212 ks (P) \u2212\nki (Q). The phase matching function no longer depends\non \u03c6s \u2212 \u03c6i due to the presence of the spatial walk-off.\nThe mode function of the two-photon state is a coherent sum of all the partial amplitudes due to the possible generation of a pair of photons at position z inside\n\nthe crystal [22]. Since the beam moves in the xz plane\nwith angle \u03c10 when propagating along z, the amplitude\nfor each z shows increasing ellipticity, contributing differently to the total OAM decomposition of the spatial\nwaveform of the two-photon state.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the elucidation of\nthe OAM correlations of entangled photons generated in\nSPDC can be addressed in two complementary scenarios, giving correspondingly different OAM correlations\nbetween the photons. One scenario considers the quantum amplitudes in the whole down-conversion cone, while\nthe other scenario, experimentally relevant for quantum\ninformation protocols that make use of the OAM, pays\nattention to a small section of the down-conversion cone.\nThe results obtained here are of great importance for\nother configurations where entangled paired photons are\ngenerated. This is the case of pairs of photons generated\nthrough two-photon Raman transitions in electromagnetic induced transparency schemes [23]. Recently, the\nOAM correlations between stokes and anti-stokes photons has been measured in trapped Rubidium cold atoms\nin a counter-propagating nearly collinear geometry [24].\nThe measured correlations comply with the selection rule\nmp \u2212 mc = m1 \u2212 m2 , where mc refers to the OAM per\nphoton of a laser control beam that counter propagates\nwith the pump beam. The corresponding selection rule\nfor counter propagating signal and idler photons [20] in\nSPDC would be mp = m1 \u2212 m2 . We expect that a similar experiment in a highly noncollinear geometry, such a\ntransverse emitting configuration [25], would yield strong\ndepartures from the selection rule mp \u2212 mc = m1 \u2212 m2\nmeasured for a nearly collinear geometry.\nThis work was supported by projects FIS2004-03556\nand Consolider-Ingenio 2010 QOIT from Spain, by the\nEuropean Commission (Qubit Applications (QAP), Contract No. 015848) and by the Generalitat de Catalunya.\n\n[1] L.
