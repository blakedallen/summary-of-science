A capacitor connected via a quantum point contact (QPC) to an\nedge state shows mesoscopic capacitance oscillations and\na quantized charge relaxation resistance1,2,3,4,5 . In addition a recent experiment demonstrated an \"electron gun\"\nemitting and absorbing a single electron in every oscillation cycle6 . The emission process7,8,9 injects an electron into states above the Fermi level, whereas absorption of an electron leaves a hole below the Fermi energy.\nThe invention of Lasers revolutionized optics. Similarly,\nsingle electron injectors either using capacitors or quantized electron pumps10,11,12,13,14 provide novel, coherent\nsources for electronics.\nIt is a challenging task to detect the electrons with the\nspeed they were emitted with. In modern experiments\nthe dynamics of single electron transport through a mesoscopic system is often explored experimentally using as a\ncharge detector, either a radio-frequency single-electron\ntransistor15,16,17 or a QPC18,19,20,21 . However the speed\nof these detectors is not sufficient to detect electrons with\na nanosecond resolution. To circumvent this problem,\nwe propose as a fast detector a device which is analogous to the emitter: a quantum capacitor, such as used\nin2,6 . Such a detector is able to register particles as fast\nas an emitter can inject them into the quantum circuit.\nWe therefore consider a system consisting of two quantum cavities coupled in series by a single edge state and\nmodulated by in general different, periodically-varying\npotentials, both with frequency \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe charge emitted by the first cavity is detected by nullifying the total current with the use of the modulation\nof the second cavity. Namely, the potential U2 (t) can\nbe chosen in such a way that the total current vanishes.\nIn general the current I(t) consists of a series of pulses\ncorresponding to electrons and holes emitted by either of\nthe cavities. However if the time when an electron was\nemitted by the first cavity coincides with the time when\na hole was emitted by the second cavity the total current I(t) is suppressed.

Alternatively, being driven in phase such a double-capacitor\nsystem can serve as a two-electron (two-hole) emitter.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND FORMALISM\n\nThe system consists of two cavities with edge states of\ncircumference L1 and L2 connected via QPCs with the\nreflection (transmission) amplitudes r1 (t1 ) and r2 (t2 )\nto an edge state of length d and modulated by timedependent potentials U1 (t) and U2 (t) respectively. A\nparticle with energy E entering the cavity j picks up a\nphase kLj , which is the kinetic phase of the guiding center motion23 . The time \u03c4j that a particle spends for one\nrevolution in the cavity j is related to the cavity's level\n\n\f2\nspacing, \u2206j = h/\u03c4j .

(3)\ninto the current formula of Eq. (4), we obtain a general\nresult for the total current due to a harmonic modulation of the system. We first investigate the adiabatic\nregime, specifying results at zero and at high temperatures. Subsequently corrections to the adiabatic results\nand the strongly nonadiabatic limit are considered.\n\nA.\n\n(6)\n\nThe phase \u03c6j (E, t) can be written as the sum of a timedependent and a time-independent contribution\n\u03c6j (E, t) =: \u22122\u03c0e\u03b4Uj (t)/\u2206j + 2\u03c0\u03c7j (E),\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c4j\n~\n\nwith 2\u03c0\u03c7j (E) = (E \u2212 \u03bc) + k(\u03bc)Lj \u2212 2\u03c0e\u016aj /\u2206j + \u03c6rj .\nThe phase of the respective QPC's reflection coefficient is\ngiven by \u03c6rj , with rj = |rj |exp(i\u03c6rj ). The detuning \u03c7j \u2206j\ndefines the position of the quantum level in the cavity j\nwith respect to the Fermi level \u03bc at zero driving amplitude, \u03b4Uj (t) = 0. Thus to lowest order in frequency the\ncurrent consists of a sum of separate contributions of the\ntwo cavities. This means that the total time-dependent\ncurrent can be nullified, whenever the phase difference\n\u03b42 \u2212 \u03b41 of the two harmonic modulations is equal to \u03c0\nand when the amplitudes together with the cavity parameters are adjusted in an appropriate way. We now choose\na harmonic time-dependence, \u03b4Uj (t) = Uj cos(\u03a9t + \u03b4j ),\nwith Uj > 0.\nB.\n\n\u2032 in\u03a9(t\u2212t\u2032 )\n\nTj\n1\np\n.\n\u2206j 2 \u2212 Tj \u2212 2 1 \u2212 Tj cos \u03c6j (E, t)\n\n(4)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nWith the transmission Tj = |tj | the density of states is\n\u03bdj (t, E) =\n\nq=1\n\nStot (t, E) =\n\nto the instantaneous densities of states \u03bdj = \u03bdj (t, E) =\n\u2202Sj (E\u2212eUj (t))\n1\n\u2217\nof the two cavities\n2\u03c0i Sj (E \u2212 eUj (t))\n\u2202E\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u2202U1 (t)\n\u2202U2 (t)\nI (1) (t) = e2 dE (\u2212f \u2032 (E)) \u03bd1\n+ \u03bd2\n.

In the adiabatic\nlimit, \u03a9 \u2192 0, where the time scale set by the modulation is much larger than the time particles spend in\nthe cavities and the connecting edge state, we expand\nEq. (4) in first order \u03a9. The current I (1) (t) is related\n\nCurrent nullification at kB T = 0\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the time integral of the squared current, Eq.

To understand\nthese plots, we consider the limit of very low transmission\nat the QPC's, Tj \u226a 1. Then the instantaneous density of\nstates, Eq. (6), of the cavities takes the form of a sum of\nBreit-Wigner resonances, around the zeroes of the quantity \u03c6j (E, t), defined in Eq. (7), to be taken mod2\u03c0.

Its arguments t\u00b1\n\u2212\nt\n1\n2\nare taken mod2\u03c0, in the interval [\u2212\u03c0/\u03a9, \u03c0/\u03a9]. The four\nLorentzians contribute only if the respective resonance\ntimes are close to each other compared to the width of\nthe current pulse. If the first two Lorentzians contribute,\ntwo particles are emitted by the system at the same\ntime, either two electrons or two holes and h(I (1) )2 i is\nmaximized. We are instead interested in the situation\nwhere both of the last two terms contribute, meaning\nthat one cavity emits a hole approximately at the same\n\n2e2\n(\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 \u2212 \u03c0)\n,\nw\u03c0 (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 \u2212 \u03c0)2 + 4w2 \u03a92\n\n(11)\n\nwhere (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 \u2212 \u03c0) is taken mod2\u03c0 on the interval\n[\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. In Fig. 2 (a) we show h(I (1) )2 i as a function of\n\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 at finite transmission probability of the QPCs for\neU2\neU1\nT1 \u22061 = T2 \u22062 . Whenever the maximum is at \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 = 0,\nboth the two electrons and the two holes are respectively emitted at the same time (solid and dashed-dotted\ncurve). Whenever the minimum is at \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 = \u03c0, any\nemitted electron is annihilated by a hole at the same\ntime (solid and dashed line). If the current pulses of an\nelectron of one cavity and a hole of the other are both\ncoinciding but the width of the pulses are different, the\ndistance of the minimum of h(I (1) )2 i from zero is\nh(I (1) )2 i =\n\ne2 (w1 \u2212 w2 )2\n,\n\u03c0 w1 w2 (w1 + w2 )\n\n(12)\n\nshowing a smooth dependence on the system parameters.\nIt guarantees the robustness of the dip against small deviations from the ideal conditions. This minimum for the\nmore general case of Eq.

(5). Then\nfrom Eq. (1) we find that the time integral of the square\nof the low-frequency current takes a particularly simple\nform\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nh(I (1) )2 i\nU1\nU1 U2\nU22\n2\n.(13)\n+\n2\ncos(\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n)\n+\n=\ne\n1\n2\n\u03c0e2 \u03a9\n\u220621\n\u22061 \u22062\n\u220622\nIt shows a cosine-like behavior as a function of the phasedifference, in contrast to the zero-temperature result,\nwhere the width of the dips (peaks) is determined by wj .\nIndependently of the detuning of the two cavities and the\ntransmission of the QPCs, h(I (1) )2 i is exactly zero when\neU1 /\u22061 = eU2 /\u22062 and \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 = \u03c0 and deviates from\n2\nzero at \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 = \u03c0, by \u03c0e2 \u03a9 (eU1 /\u22061 \u2212 eU2 /\u22062 ) .\n\n\f4\nD.\n\nCorrection to the adiabatic response\n\nThe response in second order in frequency\n\u0014\nZ\n\u2202U2 (t)\n\u2202\ne2 h\n\u03bd2\ndE (\u2212f \u2032 (E))\nI (2) (t) = \u2212\n2\n\u2202t 2 \u2202t\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u2202U1 (t) \u0002 2\n+\n\u03bd1 + 2\u03bd1 \u03bd2 + 2\u03bd1 \u03bdd ,\n\u2202t\n\n(14)\n\ncontains mixed terms in the densities of states of the\ncavities and the connecting channel, \u03bdd = \u03bdd (E), as well.\nComprising information about the entire system, it can\nlead to non-vanishing contributions in the regime where\nthe adiabatic current response vanishes. It is interesting\nto consider corrections in higher order \u03a9, Eq. (14), which\nwhen h(I (1) )2 i vanishes are dominant. Independently of\nthe temperature regime, the correction to hI 2 i in second\norder in \u03a9, for the parameters where h(I (1) )2 i in first\norder in \u03a9 vanishes is always zero. The leading term in\n\u03a9 of hI 2 i is then at least of third power in \u03a9.\nAt zero temperature and small QPC transmission under the conditions given in Eqs. (10) we find that hI 2 i \u223c\n\u00012\n\u00012\nh I (2) i is of the order h I (2) i \u223c (e2 /w) (\u03c41 /T w)2 ,\nwhere \u03c41 /T is the dwell time for an electron in the\nfirst cavity. In comparison, the contribution stemming\nfrom the first order in frequency current away from res\u00012\nonance is h I (1) i \u223c e2 /w, see Eq. (9). We find that\nin the non-linear regime the adiabaticity condition is\nI (2) /I (1) \u223c \u03a9\u03c4 /T 2 \u226a 1, which differs strongly from the\none in linear response, \u03a9\u03c4 /T \u226a 1.\nAt high temperature and at the parameters nullifying\n\u00012\nEq. (13), h I (2) i is in general not zero and it depends\nadditionally on the transmission of the QPCs and the\ninverse of the density of states of the connecting edge\nstate, \u2206d . However, in contrast to the low-temperature\nregime h(I (2) )2 i can be nullified by introducing further\ntransmission-dependent conditions. These conditions are\ndirectly obtained from Eq. (14) and read for cavities of\n3T2 \u22122 \u22061\n\u22061\n1\nunequal lengths, 2\u2212T\n2T1 + \u2206d \u2212 2T2 \u22062 = 0.\nE.\n\nNonadiabatic step-potential modulation\n\nIn an experimental set-up, instead of by a sinusoidal\nmodulation, the system is often driven by a square-pulse\npotential, where a treatment in the highly nonadiabatic\nregime is required. For the following analysis we start\nfrom Eqs. (3) and (4), and limit ourselves to the hightemperature regime. We are interested in a step potential\nwhich is the limit of a periodic square-pulse modulation\nwith infinitely long period. In principle, the potential\nat the two cavities can have different amplitudes and\ncan be switched on at different times t01 and t02 , with\nt02 = t01 + \u03c4d + \u2206t0 , the sum of the switching time of\nthe first cavity t01 , the time a particle needs to pass\nthrough the connecting edge state \u03c4d and a time-delay\n\u2206t0 , where here we choose \u2206t0 = 0. The step potentials\n\nat the two cavities read Uj (t) = Uj if t \u2265 t0j and 0 otherwise. The cavities' response to the potentials decays\nwith a characteristic time given by the bigger value of\n{\u03c41 /ln(1/R1 ), \u03c42 /ln(1/R2 )}. After a waiting time which\nis much bigger than the decay time, the charge emitted\nby the system equals the sum of the charges that would\nbe emitted by two completely independent cavities and\neU2\n1\nis given by Q = e eU\n\u22061 + e \u22062 . While this charge is nullieU2\n1\nfied for eU\n\u22061 = \u2212 \u22062 , the nullifying of the integral of the\nsquared current can in general not be reached, meaning\nthat an AC current is generated.\nTo find some simple analytical results, let us restrict\nourselves to the limit of identical (r1 = r2 and L1 = L2 ),\nweakly coupled cavities (T1 = T2 = T \u2192 0) and consider\nthe interesting case where the total charge is nullified\nand hI 2 i is suppressed, i.e. U1 = \u2212U2 \u2261 U . For a single\ncavity as well as for the double-cavity system we find the\ntime-integral over the squared current to be of the form\n2\n\nhI 2 i =\n\ne2 (eU )\nF (T, U ) .\nh \u2206\n\n(15)\n\nThe function F for a system with a single cavity is given\nby Fsingle = T /2. For the double-cavity system with\nequal lengths, F (T, U ) oscillates in the potential difference with a phase \u03c6 = 2\u03c0e(U1 \u2212 U2 )/\u2206 = 4\u03c0eU/\u2206. We\nfind Fdouble = T 3 /[2 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c6)], if \u03c6 6= 2n\u03c0, Fdouble =\nT 3 /2 if \u03c6 = (2n+1)\u03c0 and Fdouble = T /4, if \u03c6 = 2n\u03c0. The\ntime integral of the squared current is of the same order\nfor the system of a single and a double cavity, showing\nthat the coupling between the two cavities is important\nin the highly nonadiabatic regime. This is indicated already in Eq. (14), where in second order \u03a9 mixed terms\nin the densities of states of the two cavities appear.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe investigated the AC current response of a twoparticle emitter consisting of a double-cavity system, and\npropose it as an efficient tool for counting electrons emitted at high speed. The square of the total current integrated over one period shows a pronounced dip when the\ntwo cavities are synchronized. We extract the conditions\nfor perfect counting by complete current nullification and\nshow that in the adiabatic regime the counting efficiency\nis maintained at small deviations from the obtained conditions. In the highly nonadiabatic regime, current nullification can in general not be obtained. However, in\nprinciple, pulsed cavities can be used to analyze single\nevents.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJ.
