Rev. A 67 (2003), 051402(R)] that the equation for the\nmarginal Wigner distribution in an optical lattice admits a scale-free distribution corresponding to\nTsallis statistics. Here we show that this distribution is invariant under an asymptotic symmetry of\nthe equation, hence that this scale-free behavior can be understood in terms of symmetry analysis.\n\nIn a recent paper with R. Mancinelli [1] we have considered asymptotic symmetries of differential equations and\nof their (asymptotic) solutions; in there we considered\nin particular application to a given class of anomalous\nreaction-diffusion equations which had been extensively\nstudied numerically [2], obtaining a theoretical explanation of the observed long-time behavior of solutions. The\nsame approach has also been extended to a discrete version of these equations [3].\nIn this note we apply our approach to a different kind\nof anomalous diffusion; that is, we focus on the equation\ndescribing anomalous transport in an optical lattice [4, 5].\nThe equation for the marginal Wigner distribution w(p, t)\nof the momentum p at time t reads\nwt = \u2212\n\n\u2202\n[h(p) w \u2212 g(p) wp ]\n\u2202p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the functions h(p) and g(p) are given by\nh(p) :=\n\n\u03b31\n\u2212\u03b1p\n, g(p) := \u03b30 +\n; (2)\n1 + (p/pc )2\n1 + (p/pc )2\n\nhere \u03b1, \u03b30 , \u03b31 are certain constants, pc represents the capture momentum.\nEquation (1) should be complemented by a choice of\nthe function space to which the function w(p, t) belongs.\nOn physical grounds, we require that w(p, t) at fixed t is\nnormalizable and vanishes asymptotically,\n|w(p, t)| \u2192 0 for |p| \u2192 \u221e .\n\n(3)\n\nWe stress that there is a range of parameters (\u22121/2 < \u03bc)\n[5] for which there is an equilibrium distribution with\nthese properties; this is the range to be studied here.\nThe explicit expressions of h(p) and g(p) make that,\nwith the shorthand notation \u03b2(p) := 1/[1 + (p/pc )2 ], the\nequation (1), (2) reads\nwt = (\u03b30 + \u03b2(p)\u03b31 ) wpp +\n\u0001\n+ \u03b1\u03b2(p) \u2212 2\u03b31 [\u03b2(p)/pc ]2 \u0001p wp +\n+ \u03b1 \u03b2(p) \u2212 2[(p/pc )\u03b2(p)]2 w .\n\n(4)\n\nAttention to eq. (4) was recently called by Lutz [5]\n(to which the reader is also referred for derivation and a\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gaeta@mat.unimi.it\n\ndiscussion of this equation), who remarked that \u2013 quite\nsurprisingly \u2013 the equilibrium distribution is a Tsallis\ndistribution, i.e. a distribution optimizing the Tsallis\nentropy [6]. Indeed, the stationary solution of (4) turns\nout to be\n\u0003\u03bc\n1 \u0002\nw0 (p) =\n(5)\n1 \u2212 (\u03b2/\u03bc) p2\nZ\nwhere\n\u03b1\n1\n2\u03b30\n\u03b2=\n, \u03bc=\n, q = 1 + 2 := 1 + \u03b4 , (6)\n2(\u03b30 + \u03b31 )\n1\u2212q\n\u03b1pc\nand ZR is a normalization factor, which can be chosen so\n\u221e\nthat \u2212\u221e w0 (p)dp = 1. The physical range is q < 3;\nRthe2 case 5/3 < q < 3 (for which the second moment\np w0 (p)dp diverges) corresponds to anomalous moment\ndiffusion [5].\nThe peculiar properties of this equation and its stationary solution, in particular concerning the power-law\ndecay of w0 (p) for large |p|, hence its scale-free nature,\nhas been studied by Abe [7] in connection with dilation\nsymmetries and canonical formalism.\nHere we will consider generalized scaling transformations; that is, local transformations acting as a standard\nscaling in the independent p and t variables, and as a p\nand t dependent scaling in the dependent variable w(p, t).\nMoreover, we will not require to have a full invariance of\nthe equation, but be satisfied in asymptotic invariance\n(for large |p| and t and hence, in view of (3), small w),\nas discussed in detail in [1].\nWe start by recalling a general feature of symmetry\ntransformations and symmetry invariance for PDEs and\ntheir solutions [8\u201310]; we will specialize to a scalar PDEs\nfor w = w(p, t).\nUnder an infinitesimal transformation with generator\nX = \u03be(p, t, w)\u2202p + \u03c4 (p, t, w)\u2202t + \u03c6(p, t, w)\u2202w\n\n(7)\n\n(that is, p 7\u2192 pb = p + \u03b5\u03be(p, t, w), and so on) the function\nw(p, t) is mapped to a new function w(p,\nb t) with w(p,\nb t) =\nw(p, t) + \u03b5[\u03b4w(p, t)] and\n\u03b4w = [\u03c6 \u2212 wp \u03be \u2212 wt \u03c4 ]w=w(p,t) .\n\n(8)\n\nApplying this to the distribution (5) and to generalized\nscalings we get with easy computations that (up to a\ncommon factor) the transformation generated by (7) with\n\u03be = \u2212p leaves (5) invariant if and only if\n\u03c6 = (2 \u03b2 Z q\u22121 ) p2 wq ;\n\n(9)\n\n\f2\nobviously \u03c4 = \u03c3t remains unrestricted at this stage.\nConversely, a function w(p) is invariant under X =\n\u2212p\u2202p + (2\u03b2Z q\u22121 )p2 wq \u2202w if and only if w(p) is of the\nform (5); this is easily checked by using (8). We will\nwrite, from now on,\n\u03b4 = q \u2212 1 , \u03bd = 2\u03b2Z \u03b4 .\n\n(10)\n\nAlbeit our analysis will be conducted at the infinitesimal level, we note that the action of the one-parameter\ngroup (denote by s the group parameter) generated by\nX = \u2212p\u2202p + \u03bdp2 w1+\u03b4 \u2202w on the p and w variables is to\nmap (p, w) = (p0 , w0 ) into (p(s), w(s)) with\np(s) = e\u2212s p0 ,\n\u0003\u2212(1/\u03b4)\n\u0002\nw0 .\nw(s) = 1 + (\u03bdp20 /2)(1 \u2212 e\u22122s )w0\u03b4\n\n(11)\n\nWe are now going to discuss what is special in the\ngeneralized scaling vector fields identified above\n\u0001\n(12)\nX = \u2212p\u2202p + \u03c3t\u2202t + \u03bd p2 wq \u2202w\nfor what concerns their action on the equation (4).\nWe follow the general procedure for group analysis of\ndifferential equations [8\u201310]. By acting with X on the\n(p, t, w) variables, we induce a transformation in the partial derivatives of w with respect to p and t as well (also\ncalled the second prolongation of X); this is described \u2013\nrestricting to partial derivatives occurring in (4) \u2013 by the\nvector field\nY = X + \u03a8t\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03a8p\n+ \u03a8pp\n;\n\u2202wt\n\u2202wp\n\u2202wpp\n\n(13)\n\nthe coefficients \u03a8 appearing in here is as follows: under the infinitesimal transformation described by X, the\npartial derivatives get transformed as wp \u2192 wp + \u03b5\u03a8p ,\nwt \u2192 wt + \u03b5\u03a8t , wpp \u2192 wpp + \u03b5\u03a8pp .\nWhen X is the generalized scaling (12), i.e. for the\nmapping p \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03b5)p, t \u2192 (1 + \u03b5\u03c3)t, w \u2192 (1 +\n\u03b5(\u03bdp2 w\u03b4 ))w, the corresponding \u03a8 can be easily computed\nby the so-called prolongation formula [8\u201310] to be\n\u03a8t = \u2212\u03c3wt + \u03bdqp2 w\u03b4 ;\n\u03a8p = wp + 2\u03bdpw(1+\u03b4) + \u03bd(1 + \u03b4)p2 w\u03b4 ;\n(1+\u03b4)\n\u03a8pp = 2wpp + 2\u03bdw\n\u0002 2 2+\n\u0003\n(\u03b4\u22121)\n\u03bdw\n(1 + \u03b4) \u03b4p wp + pw(4wp + pwpp ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThese determine how the differential equation (4) of interest here is transformed under X.\nIn computational terms, this is done by applying Y on\n(4), and substituting for wt according to (4) itself; the\nobtained expression must be zero for X to be a symmetry\nof the equation. Proceeding in this way, we obtain a\ncondition which we write in compact form (see below for\nthe explicit expressions of the functions Ak ) as\nA0 (p, t, w) + A1 (p, t, w) wp + A2 (p, t, w) wpp = 0 . (15)\nThe functions Ak must vanish separately for (15) to be\nsatisfied.\n\nThe explicit expression of A2 is\nA2 = \u2212\u03b30 (2 + \u03c3) \u2212\n\n\u03b31 p2c (p2c (2 + \u03c3) + (4 + \u03c3)p2 )\n. (16)\n[p2c + p2 ]2\n\nThe limit of this for large |p| is nonzero unless we choose,\nas we do from now on,\n\u03c3 = \u22122 .\n\n(17)\n\nWith this choice, X reads\nX = \u2212p \u2202p \u2212 2 t \u2202t + \u03bd p2 wq \u2202w\n\n(18)\n\nand A2 reduces to\nA2 =\n\n\u22122 \u03b31 pc 2 p2\n(pc 2 + p2 )\n\n2\n\n;\n\n(19)\n\ntherefore, A2 \u2192 0 for |p| \u2192 \u221e.\nAs for A1 , with the choice (17) it reads\n\u0002\nA1 = 2p (p2c + p2 )(\u03b1p4c \u2212 2(1 + \u03b4)\u03b30 \u03bdw\u03b4 (p2c + w2 )2 )\n\u22122\u03b31 p2c ((1 + \u03b4)\u03bdp4c w\u03b4 + p2 (\u22121 + \u03bdw\u03b4 p2 + \u03b4\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 )\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22123\n+p2c (1 + 2\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 + 2\u03b4\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 )) \u00d7 p2c + p2\n.\n(20)\nThis is a more involved expression, but it is still easy to\ncheck that in the limit |p| \u2192 \u221e and w \u2192 0, recall (3),\nwe get A1 \u2192 0.\nFinally, and again with (17), A0 reads\n\u0002\nA0 = w(\u22122\u03bdw\u03b4 (p2c + p2 )(\u03b31 p2c (p2c \u2212 p2 )+\n+\u03b30 (p2c + p2 )2 )+\n+\u03b1p2c (\u2212((2 + \u03b4)\u03bdw\u03b4 p6 ) \u2212 2p2c\u0003p2 (3 + 2\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 )+\n+p4c (2 \u2212 2\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 + \u03b4\u03bdw\u03b4 p2 ))) \u00d7\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22123\n\u00d7 p2c + p2\n.\n(21)\nOnce again, for |p| \u2192 \u221e and w \u2192 0 we get A0 \u2192 0.\nThis computation shows on the one hand that the oneparameter group of transformations generated by (18) is\nnot a symmetry of the equation (4), as the Ak are not\nidentically zero; on the other hand, it shows that (18)\nis an asymptotic symmetry for this equation, defined in\nthe function space identified by (3). No vector field of\nthe form (12) with \u03c3 6= \u22122 is an asymptotic symmetry\nof (4); hence (18) is the only invariance generator for (5)\nwhich is also an asymptotic symmetry of (4).\nLet us discuss the effect on (18) on the normalization\ncondition (3). Using (8) we obtain that a generic function\nw(p, t) is mapped by (18) into w\nb = w + \u03b5\u03b4w with \u03b4w =\n\u03bdp2 wq + pwp + 2twt ; on solutions to (1) this reads\n\u03b4w = \u03bd p2 wq + p wp \u2212 2t\n\n\u2202\n(hw \u2212 gwp ) .\n\u2202p\n\n(22)\n\nR +\u221e\nWith I[w] := \u2212\u221e w(p, t)dp, we obviously have I[w]\nb =\nI[w] + \u03b5I[\u03b4w]. In view of (22), the latter amounts to\nI[\u03b4w] = \u03bdI[p2 wq ] + I[pwp ] + 2t I[\u2202p (hw \u2212 gwp )] . (23)\n\n\f3\nIt is immediate to see, using also an integration by parts\nfor the last one, that (3) implies the finiteness of the last\ntwo integrals in (23).\nAs for I[p2 wq ], note that (3) holds if, for |p| \u2192 \u221e,\nw(p) \u2243 1/p2k with k > 1/2. For general solutions w(p, t),\nthe condition of normalizable variation kq > 3/2 is more\nrestrictive than the normalization condition k > 1/2 for\nall q in the physical range q < 3.\nNote that for w(p) given by (5), k = 1/\u03b4 and the condition kq > 3/2 holds for all q < 3; that is, functions which\nare near to the stationary solution w0 (p) will always have\nnormalizable variation under (18).\nThus, strictly speaking, our method should be applied\nonly on functions satisfying |I[p2 wq ]| < \u221e, i.e. decaying\n(for |p| \u2192 \u221e) faster than 1/|p|3/q . As observed above,\nthis includes all functions near to the Tsallis distribution\n(5), for all q in the physical range.\nThe (asymptotic) invariance of (4) under (18) could\nalso be analyzed using the systematic procedure of [1];\nthis requires to introduce symmetry-adapted coordinates\n(v, y, \u03c3), with v the dependent variable. These are the\ncoordinates in which (18) is simply X = \u22122\u03c3\u2202\u03c3 , and\nits action on derivatives up to order two is described by\nY = X +2v\u03c3 (\u2202/\u2202v\u03c3 ) [8\u201310]. In the present case, adapted\ncoordinates are \u03c3 = t, y = p2 /t, v = w\u2212\u03b4 \u2212 (\u03bd\u03b4/2)p2 .\nFinally, let us briefly mention differences with the\nwork by Abe [7]. Abe considered a dilation symmetry of (4), based on an auxiliary field \u039b(p) which could\nbe not\nR normalizable. The Abe symmetry has generator\nG = p\u039bp w dp. In the language of symmetry theory [8\u2013\n10] this is a nonlocal symmetry (it depends on an integral\nover p rather than just on the value of w at the point p),\nwhereas here we considered local ones. Moreover Abe\nworked in canonical formalism, which requires to select\na symplectic structure, whereas here we did not consider\n\n[1] G. Gaeta and R.

The two approaches are thus\nquite different; it appears that symmetries considered by\nAbe are more general, while the one considered here has\nthe advantage of being a local one.\nLet us summarize our discussion. We have considered\nthe equation for the marginal Wigner distribution w(p, t)\nof the momentum p at time t in an optical lattice from the\npoint of view of symmetry analysis. It is known that this\nequation admits the distribution w0 (p) as a stationary\nsolution.\nWe have identified the generalized scaling invariance\ngroup of w0 (p), described by (11) and generated by X =\n\u2212p\u2202p + (2\u03b2Z q\u22121 p2 wq )\u2202w .\nWe passed then to consider generalized scalings (12)\nacting on the time variable as well; it is easily seen that\nthese cannot be symmetries of the equation (4). We investigated then if they may be asymptotic symmetries for\nthat equation, and observed that a necessary condition\nfor this is provided by (17). With this choice, it turns\nout that we have indeed an asymptotic symmetry, whose\ngenerator is (18), of our equation.\nThis shows that the Tsallis distribution (4) is an invariant function for a transformation X which is an\nasymptotic symmetry (for large |p|) of the equation under\nstudy, and hence that the scale-free asymptotic behavior\nof w0 (p) is a consequence of the asymptotic symmetry\nproperties of the equation (4) describing the characteristics of the optical lattice.\nI gratefully thank the referees for constructive remarks,\nand R.
