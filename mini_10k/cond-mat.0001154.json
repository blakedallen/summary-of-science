Excitation energies of the helium and beryllium atoms are calculated, both from\nthe exact Kohn-Sham ground-state potential, and from two orbital-dependent approximations. These are exact exchange and self-interaction corrected local density approximation\n(SIC-LDA), both calculated using Krieger-Li-Iafrate approximation. For the exchangecorrelation kernels, three adiabatic approximations were tested: the local density approximation, exact exchange, and SIC-LDA. The choice of the ground-state exchange\ncorrelation potential has the largest impact on the absolute position of most excitation\nenergies. In particular, orbital-dependent approximate potentials result in a uniform shift\nof the transition energies to the Rydberg states.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1] of ground-state density functional theory (DFT) guarantees that every observable of a stationary physical system can be expressed in terms of its\nground-state density. In principle, this is also true for the set of excited-state energies, and\nseveral extensions of ground-state DFT have been proposed [2]- [13]. Accurate calculations\nof excitation energies, however, remain a difficult subject. Recently, some of us proposed\na different approach to the calculation of excitation energies [14], within the framework\nof time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) [15]. The central idea is to use the fact that the linear\ndensity response has poles at the physical excitation energies and can be calculated from the\nresponse function of a noninteracting Kohn-Sham (KS) system and a frequency-dependent\nKohn-Sham (KS) kernel. In this way, we obtain the shifts of the KS orbital differences\n(which are the poles of the KS response function) towards the true excitation energies.\nRecent applications [16]- [25] suggest that this method may become a standard tool in\nquantum chemistry.\n1\n\n\fThe success of any density functional method, however, depends on the quality of\nthe functionals employed. In this article, we investigate the relative importance of the\napproximations inherent in the TDDFT formalism for the calculation of discrete excitation\nenergies of finite systems. This mainly concerns the role of the ground-state XC potential,\nvxc (r) compared to the dynamical XC kernel, fxc (r, r\u2032; \u03c9). For the helium and beryllium\natoms, we compare the results obtained from using the exact XC potentials and two orbital\ndependent potentials, one based on the exact exchange expression and the other on the\nself-interaction corrected local density approximation [26], evaluated with the method of\nKrieger, Li and Iafrate (KLI) [27]- [31] in combination with three distinct approximations\nfor the XC kernels, which are given in Sect. 2.2.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFormalism\nKohn-Sham equations for the frequency-dependent linear density response\n\nThe frequency dependent linear density response n1\u03c3 (r, \u03c9) of electrons with spin \u03c3, reacting\nto a perturbation v1\u03c3\u2032 of frequency \u03c9 can be written in terms of the interacting densitydensity response function \u03c7\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 by [32]\nn1 \u03c3 (r, \u03c9) =\n\nXZ\n\nd3 r \u2032 \u03c7\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) v1 \u03c3\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9) .\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\nIn the spin-dependent version [33] of time-dependent DFT [15], the density response n1\u03c3\ncan be expressed in terms of the response function \u03c7s \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 of the non-interacting Kohn-Sham\n(KS) system [14, 34]:\nn1 \u03c3 (r, \u03c9) =\n\nXZ\n\nd3 r \u2032 \u03c7s \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) vs,1 \u03c3\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9) .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\nThe KS response function\n\u03c7\n\ns \u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(r, r ; \u03c9) = \u03b4\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n\u03c6j\u03c3 (r)\u03c6\u2217k\u03c3 (r)\u03c6\u2217j\u03c3 (r\u2032 )\u03c6k\u03c3 (r\u2032 )\n(fk\u03c3 \u2212 fj\u03c3 )\n\u03c9 \u2212 (\u01ebj\u03c3 \u2212 \u01ebk\u03c3 ) + i\u03b7\nj,k\n\nX\n\n(3)\n\nis readily expressed in terms of the unperturbed static Kohn-Sham orbitals \u03c6k\u03c3 (with occupation numbers fj\u03c3 ).

Note that fx = Gx , as exchange contains only parallel spin contributions.\nThe simplest possible approximation is the adiabatic local (spin-)density approximation\n[35] (ALDA).

These are very significant for calculations of orbital eigenvalues, as they affect the asymptotic decay of the\nground-state potential. For example, the XC potential in the local density approximation\ndecays exponentially, so rapidly that only one virtual state is bound. An alternative approach towards the construction of improved functionals is to use perturbation theory in the\nelectron-electron coupling constant[36]. This leads to orbital-dependent functionals, which\ncan be solved self-consistently using the optimized effective potential method (OEP) [37][39]. In the time-dependent case, this method takes as a starting point a given (approximate) expression for the quantum mechanical action integral as a functional of a set of\norbitals[40]. Variation with respect to a local effective potential then leads to an integral\nequation for the exchange-correlation potential. Given an exchange-correlation potential of\nthat kind, the corresponding exchange-correlation kernel can be constructed in the same\nspirit [14, 41]. The essential steps are formally identical to the OEP construction of the\nexchange-correlation potential for the ground-state[42].\nIn the time-dependent X-only approximation, Axc is replaced by1\nALDA\nfxc\n[n](r, r\u2032) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\n\nAx\u2212only = \u2212(1/2)\n\nN\u03c3 Z\nXX\n\u03c3\n\ni,j\n\nt1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\nGALDA\n[n](r, r\u2032 ) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\nxc\n\n,\n\n3\n\nZ\n\ndt d r d3 r \u2032 \u03c6\u2217i\u03c3 (r\u2032 t)\u03c6j\u03c3 (r\u2032 t)\u03c6i\u03c3 (rt)\u03c6\u2217j\u03c3 (rt) / |r \u2212 r\u2032 | .

The key idea is to start from a particular KS orbital energy\ndifference \u01ebj\u03c3 \u2212 \u01ebk\u03c3 (at which the Kohn-Sham response function (3) has a pole) and to use\nthe formally exact representation (2) of the linear density response to calculate the shifts\nof the Kohn-Sham excitation energies towards the true excitation energies \u03a9. To extract\n\n4\n\n!\n\n\fthese shifts from the density response, we cast Eq.

(16) remains finite for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03a9. The\nexact spin-density response n1\u03c3 , on the other hand, exhibits poles at the true excitation\nenergies \u03a9. Hence, the integral operator acting on n1\u03c3 on the left-hand side of Eq. (16)\ncannot be invertible for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03a9. This means that the integral operator acting on the spindensity vector in Eq. (16) is non-invertible (i.e., has vanishing eigenvalues) at the physical\nexcitation energies.

For bound states\nof finite systems we encounter well-separated poles in the linear density response. In our\ncalculations, we include many such poles, but only those of bound states, ignoring continuum\ncontributions. The nature and size of the error this introduces has been studied by van\nGisbergen et al.[21], and does not affect the qualitative conclusions found in this work.\nA simple and extremely instructive case is when we expand about a single KS-orbital\nenergy difference \u03c9p\u03c4 [14, 16].

The singlet excitation energies are at \u03a91 . In\nthis way, the SPA already gives rise to a spin-multiplet structure in the excitation spectrum.\nWe use SPA to understand the results of different approximations, since it simply relates\nthe calculated shifts from KS eigenvalues to matrix elements of the XC kernel.\nAt this point we stress that the TDDFT formalism for the calculation of excitation\nenergies involves three different types of approximations:\n1. In the calculation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals \u03c6k (r) and their eigenvalues \u01ebk , one\nemploys some approximation of the static XC potential vxc .\n2. Given the stationary Kohn-Sham orbitals and the ground state density, the functional\nform of the XC kernel fxc \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 needs to be approximated in order to calculate the matrix\nelements defined in Eq. (22).\n3. Once the matrix elements are obtained, the infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problem\n(21) (or, equivalently, (23)) must be truncated in one way or another.\nIn the following, we are going to investigate the relative importance of the approximations\n(1.) and (2.). Furthermore, truncation effects will be estimated by comparing the results\nobtained in SPA (34,35) with the solution of the \"full\" problem (23) which is based on\nusing up to 38 bound virtual orbitals.\n2\n\nSince we are dealing with spin saturated systems, we have dropped the spin-index of \u03a6p\u03c3 .\n\n7\n\n\fTable 1: Singlet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the exact XC potential\nby using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (x-only) TDOEP (SIC)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla a\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7460 0.7718 0.7678 0.7687\n0.7659\n0.7674 0.7649 0.7578\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8392 0.8458 0.8461 0.8448\n0.8450\n0.8445 0.8448 0.8425\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.8688 0.8714 0.8719 0.8710\n0.8713\n0.8709 0.8712 0.8701\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.8819 0.8832 0.8835 0.8830\n0.8832\n0.8829 0.8832 0.8825\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.8888 0.8895 0.8898 0.8894\n0.8896\n0.8894 0.8895 0.8892\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.7772 0.7764 0.7764 0.7850\n0.7844\n0.7836 0.7833 0.7799\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8476 0.8483 0.8483 0.8500\n0.8501\n0.8497 0.8498 0.8486\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.8722 0.8726 0.8726 0.8732\n0.8733\n0.8731 0.8732 0.8727\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.8836 0.8838 0.8838 0.8841\n0.8842\n0.8841 0.8841 0.8838\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.8898 0.8899 0.8899 0.8901\n0.8901\n0.8900 0.8901 0.8899\nc\nMean abs. dev. 0.0022 0.0023 0.0021 0.0022\n0.0020\n0.0019 0.0017\nMean rel. dev.d 0.28% 0.30% 0.26% 0.28%\n0.25%\n0.24% 0.21%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\n4\n\nResults for the Helium Atom\n\nIn this section we report numerical results for excitation energies of the He atom.

This isolates the effects which exclusively arise\ndue to the approximations (2.) and (3.). The potential data provided by Umrigar and Gonze\n[45] were interpolated nonlinearly for r \u2264 10 atomic units. Around r = 10 atomic units,\nthe XC potential is almost identical to \u22121/r. This behavior was used as an extrapolation\nof the exact exchange-correlation potential to larger distances.\nTables 1 and 2 show the excitation energies of neutral helium calculated with the exact\nexchange-correlation potential. The results are compared with a highly accurate nonrelativistic variational calculation [46] of the eigenstates of Helium. It is a remarkable fact\nthat the Kohn-Sham excitation energies \u03c9jk = \u01ebj \u2212 \u01ebk are already very close to the exact spectrum, and, at the same time, are always in between the singlet and the triplet\nenergies[47, 48].\nBased on these eigenvalue differences, we have calculated the shifts towards the true\nexcitation energies using several approximations for the exchange-correlation kernels fxc :\n8\n\n\fTable 2: Triplet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the exact XC potential\nby using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (x-only) TDOEP (SIC)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7460 0.7357 0.7351 0.7232\n0.7207\n0.7313 0.7300 0.7285\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8392 0.8366 0.8368 0.8337\n0.8343\n0.8353 0.8356 0.8350\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.8688 0.8678 0.8679 0.8667\n0.8671\n0.8673 0.8675 0.8672\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.8819 0.8814 0.8815 0.8808\n0.8811\n0.8811 0.8813 0.8811\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.8888 0.8885 0.8885 0.8882\n0.8883\n0.8884 0.8884 0.8883\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.7772 0.7702 0.7698 0.7693\n0.7688\n0.7774 0.7774 0.7706\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8476 0.8456 0.8457 0.8453\n0.8453\n0.8471 0.8471 0.8456\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.8722 0.8714 0.8715 0.8712\n0.8713\n0.8720 0.8720 0.8714\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.8836 0.8832 0.8832 0.8831\n0.8831\n0.8834 0.8835 0.8832\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.8898 0.8895 0.8895 0.8895\n0.8895\n0.8897 0.8897 0.8895\nc\nMean abs. dev. 0.0035 0.0010 0.0011 0.0009\n0.0011\n0.0013 0.0012\nMean rel. dev.\n0.45% 0.14% 0.14% 0.12%\n0.15%\n0.16% 0.15%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\n\u2022 The adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA), with the inclusion of correlation\ncontributions in the parametrization of Vosko, Wilk and Nusair [49].\n\u2022 The approximate X-only time-dependent OEP (TDOEP) kernel of Eq.

To investigate\nthe effects of the truncation of the matrix equation (23) we compare the difference between\nthe single-pole approximation (SPA) and the fully coupled results. The matrix equation\n(23) was solved using N = 34 unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals of s or p symmetry. For\neach symmetry class the resulting dimension of the (fully coupled but truncated) matrix\nin Eq. (23) is (4N \u00d7 4N) (due to the spin-degeneracy of the KS orbitals of Helium and\nthe fact that the frequency-dependent Kohn-Sham response function is symmetric in the\ncomplex plane with respect to the imaginary axis). Thereby, convergence of the results to\nwithin 10\u22126 atomic units was reached within the space of bound states. When comparing\nthe results from the SPA with the results from the fully coupled matrix, we observe only\na small change in the resulting excitation energies (from a few hundredth of a percent to\nat most one half percent), independent of the functional form of the exchange-correlation\nkernel. Thus we conclude that in helium the single-pole approximation gives the dominant\ncorrection to the Kohn-Sham excitation spectrum. Hence, starting from the Kohn-Sham\neigenvalue differences as zeroth order approximation to the excitation energies, the SPA can\nbe used for the assignment of the excitation energies which are obtained as eigenvalues from\n9\n\n\fEq. (23). Recent studies using basis set expansions [21] indicate that further improvement\nof the fully coupled results can be expected from the inclusion of continuum states.

SIC\n(40)\n\nWe begin our analysis with the splitting. In the simplest case, the TDOEP X-only\nkernel, we see that the singlet transitions are always overestimated, while the triplets are\nalways underestimated. Since our TDOEP treatment is exact for exchange in this case, this\nunderscores the importance of correlation. In particular, since hfx i = hGx i = \u2212hW i/2,\nthe splitting is just 2hW i. This matrix element is always positive, correctly putting the\nsinglet above the triplet, but the splitting is typically far too big. We demonstrate the effect\nof this in table 3, in which we compare splittings with and without correlation. To see\nwhy inclusion of correlation always reduces the splitting, we note the sign and magnitude\nALDA\nof matrix elements, within ALDA. Even though both hfxc\ni and hGALDA\ni are negative,\nxc\nbecause they are dominated by their exchange contributions, we find\nhfcALDA i < \u2212hGALDA\ni<0\nc\n\n(41)\n\nbecause in Eq. (6) antiparallel correlation dominates over parallel correlation. Thus the\nALDA correlation contribution to the splitting is always negative in SPA. Note that the SIC\n11\n\n\ftreatment of the splitting is only marginally better than in ALDA because, within SPA, the\nSIC splitting is identical to that of ALDA.\nTo analyze the separate levels, we need the magnitude of the SIC corrections:\nhfcALDA i < hfcorbi := h\n\n\u03b4vcLDA [nk\u03c3 , 0]\ni < 0,\n\u03b4nk\u03c3\n\n(42)\n\nbut the numerical values of both matrix elements differ by less than 8%. Moreover,\nhGALDA\ni > |hfcorbi| > 0 .\nc\n\n(43)\n\nLooking at the singlet excitation energies of table 1 we see that in ALDA, the s-levels are\ntoo high (up to 10 mH), whereas the p-levels are too low (by up to 0.4 mH). In X-only\nTDOEP, the s-levels drop (by up to 3 mH), approaching the exact values, but the rise of\nthe p-states (by up to 8mH) is too high. Incorporating explicit correlation terms by using\nthe TDOEP-SIC kernel, the singlet lines correctly drop further (in comparison to the X-only\nresults by up to 1 mH) since 2hfcALDA i \u2212 hfcorbi \u2248 hfcALDA i in Eq. (40) is always a negative\ncontribution. But still, the p-states are too high. Regarding the triplet excitation energies\nof table 2, the ALDA s-states are too high by at most 6mH, but the p-states are almost\nidentical to the exact values. In X-only TDOEP, the triplet states experience a strong\ndownshift from the Kohn-Sham excitation energies up to 25 mH, originating from the term\n\u2212hW i (see Eq. (40)). In TDOEP-SIC, this downshift is partly screened by the positive\ncorrelation contributions 2hGALDA\ni \u2212 hfcorb i, as can be seen from Eqs. (40), (42) and (43).\nc\nThis leads to an excellent agreement with the exact values for the s-states. However, these\ni > hfcALDA i, the rise of the\ncorrelation terms are too large for the p-states. Since hGALDA\nc\ntriplet is always bigger than the dropping of the singlet.\n4.2\n\nApproximate Kohn-Sham potentials\n\nNext we explore the effect of approximate exchange-correlation potentials vxc on the calculated excitation spectrum of the He atom. We do not even report results within LDA\nand generalized gradient approximations (GGA)[50], since these potentials only support a\nfew virtual states, so that many of the transitions reported here do not even exist in such\ncalculations. (This problem is worst in small atoms, is less pronounced in molecules, and\nirrelevant in solids).\nTo produce a correct Rydberg series, the XC potential must decay as \u22121/r, an exact\nexchange effect. Hence we examine the OEP X-only potential (which, for two-electron\nsystems is identical to the Hartree-Fock potential) and the OEP-SIC [31] potential. Both\npotentials show the correct behavior for large distances from the nucleus, and support of\nall the Rydberg states is guaranteed.\nTables 4 and 5 show the approximate Kohn-Sham excitation energies and the corresponding corrected excitation energies calculated from the approximate Kohn-Sham eigenvalues\nand orbitals of the X-only potential; tables 6 and 7 are their analogs from the OEP-SIC\ncalculation. The Kohn-Sham orbital energy differences are almost uniformly shifted to larger\nvalues compared to the orbital energy differences of the exact Kohn-Sham potential. The\nshift ranges from 13.6 mH for the lowest excitation energy to 14.2 mH for excitation energies \u03a9n with n \u2265 4 for the X-only potential. The latter shift is exactly the difference\n12\n\n\fTable 4: Singlet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the X-only potential\nand by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units).\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (X-only)\na\nTransition\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfull\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7596 0.7852 0.7812 0.7822\n0.7794\n0.7578\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8533 0.8598 0.8601 0.8588\n0.8591\n0.8425\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.8830 0.8856 0.8860 0.8851\n0.8855\n0.8701\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.8961 0.8973 0.8977 0.8971\n0.8974\n0.8825\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.9030 0.9037 0.9040 0.9036\n0.9038\n0.8892\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.7905 0.7900 0.7900 0.7986\n0.7981\n0.7799\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8616 0.8623 0.8623 0.8640\n0.8641\n0.8486\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.8864 0.8867 0.8867 0.8874\n0.8875\n0.8727\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.8978 0.8980 0.8980 0.8983\n0.8984\n0.8838\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.9040 0.9041 0.9041 0.9043\n0.9043\n0.8899\nMean abs. dev.c\n0.0118 0.0156 0.0153 0.0162\n0.0161\nMean percentage error 1.37% 1.85% 1.81% 1.93%\n1.90%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\nTable 5: Triplet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the X-only potential\nand by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units).\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (X-only)\nTransition\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7596 0.7493 0.7488 0.7370\n0.7345\n0.7285\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8533 0.8507 0.8508 0.8478\n0.8484\n0.8350\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.8830 0.8820 0.8821 0.8809\n0.8812\n0.8672\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.8961 0.8956 0.8957 0.8950\n0.8953\n0.8811\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.9030 0.9027 0.9028 0.9024\n0.9026\n0.8883\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.7905 0.7833 0.7830 0.7824\n0.7819\n0.7706\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8616 0.8595 0.8596 0.8591\n0.8592\n0.8456\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.8864 0.8855 0.8856 0.8853\n0.8854\n0.8714\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.8978 0.8973 0.8974 0.8972\n0.8973\n0.8832\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.9040 0.9037 0.9037 0.9037\n0.9037\n0.8895\nMean abs. dev.c\n0.0175 0.0149 0.0149 0.0130\n0.0129\nMean percentage error 2.11% 1.78% 1.78% 1.53%\n1.51%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\n13\n\n\fTable 6: Singlet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the SIC-LDA potential\nand by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units).\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (SIC)\na\nTransition\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfull\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7838 0.8111 0.8070 0.8065 0.8039 0.7578\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8825 0.8891 0.8895 0.8878 0.8881 0.8425\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.9130 0.9156 0.9161 0.9150 0.9154 0.8701\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.9263 0.9276 0.9280 0.9273 0.9276 0.8825\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.9333 0.9340 0.9343 0.9339 0.9341 0.8892\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.8144 0.8145 0.8144 0.8222 0.8217 0.7799\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8906 0.8915 0.8915 0.8929 0.8930 0.8486\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.9163 0.9167 0.9167 0.9172 0.9173 0.8727\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.9280 0.9282 0.9282 0.9285 0.9285 0.8838\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.9343 0.9344 0.9344 0.9346 0.9346 0.8899\nMean abs. dev.c\n0.0406 0.0446 0.0443 0.0449 0.0447\nMean percentage error 4.74% 5.25% 5.21% 5.29% 5.26%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\nTable 7: Triplet excitation energies of neutral helium, calculated from the SIC-LDA potential\nand by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units).\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (SIC)\nTransition\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nexactb\n1s \u2192 2s\n0.7838 0.7727 0.7722 0.7681 0.7668 0.7285\n1s \u2192 3s\n0.8825 0.8799 0.8800 0.8786 0.8789 0.8350\n1s \u2192 4s\n0.9130 0.9120 0.9121 0.9115 0.9117 0.8672\n1s \u2192 5s\n0.9263 0.9258 0.9259 0.9256 0.9257 0.8811\n1s \u2192 6s\n0.9333 0.9331 0.9331 0.9329 0.9330 0.8883\n1s \u2192 2p\n0.8144 0.8062 0.8058 0.8140 0.8139 0.7706\n1s \u2192 3p\n0.8906 0.8885 0.8885 0.8899 0.8899 0.8456\n1s \u2192 4p\n0.9163 0.9154 0.9154 0.9159 0.9159 0.8714\n1s \u2192 5p\n0.9280 0.9275 0.9276 0.9278 0.9278 0.8832\n1s \u2192 6p\n0.9343 0.9340 0.9340 0.9342 0.9342 0.8895\nMean abs. dev.c\n0.0462 0.0435 0.0434 0.0438 0.0437\nMean percentage error 5.50% 5.15% 5.14% 5.19% 5.18%\na Using the lowest 34 unoccupied orbitals of s and p symmetry, respectively.\nb Nonrelativistic variational calculation [38].\nc Mean value of the absolute deviations from the exact values.\n\n14\n\n\fTable 8: Singlet-triplet separations in neutral helium calculated from the X-only potential and the\nSIC-potential and by using various approximate XC kernels.

The He\nKohn-Sham orbitals exhibit a Rydberg-like behavior already for relatively low quantum numbers n [41]: already the lower virtual states are mostly determined by the large-r behavior\nof the Kohn-Sham potential, which is governed by the exchange contribution.\nAs a consequence, the corrections to the Kohn-Sham orbital energy differences, calculated on the approximate orbitals, are very close to the corrections calculated from the\nexact Kohn-Sham orbitals. This is most apparent from the singlet-triplet splittings given\nin tables 3 and 8: the splittings depend more strongly on the choice of the XC kernel than\non the choice of the potential. However, for the excitation energies, the differences among\nthe various approximations of the exchange correlation kernel are smaller than the differences in the Kohn-Sham excitation energies coming from different potentials. This reflects\nthe fact that the resulting orbitals are rather insensitive to different approximations of the\npotential. Hence, the corrections themselves, calculated with approximate XC kernels will\nnot cancel the shortcomings of an approximate exchange potential. Tables 4 - 7 show that\nthe corrections go in the right direction only for the singlet states, which are always lower\n15\n\n\fthan the corresponding Kohn-Sham orbital energy differences. In other approximations, like\nthe LDA and in the popular GGAs for instance, this will be even more severe: There the\nhighest occupied orbital eigenvalue is in error by about a factor of two, due to spurious\nself-interaction. There may be error cancellations for the lower Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences, but in general one should not expect to get a reliable (Kohn-Sham) spectrum in\nLDA and GGAs, because the respective potentials have the wrong behavior for large r. In\naddition, this causes the number of (unoccupied) bound KS states to be finite.\nIn total, the inaccuracies introduced by approximate ground state Kohn-Sham potentials\nare substantial, but mostly reside in the occupied eigenvalue for He. It is very unlikely\nthat these defects will be cured by better approximations of fxc alone, since the terms\ncontaining fxc only give corrections to the underlying Kohn-Sham eigenvalue spectrum.\nHence, the quantitative calculation of excitation energies heavily depends on the accuracy\nof the ground-state potential employed.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nResults for the Beryllium Atom\nExact Kohn-Sham potential\n\nThe beryllium atom serves as a further standard example for first principles treatments:\nbesides numerous quantum chemical studies (e.g. [52, 53]), a highly accurate ground-state\nexchange-correlation potential, obtained from quantum Monte-Carlo methods [54], is available for this system. With this potential, we calculated accurate Kohn-Sham orbitals and\norbital energies of the beryllium atom. In each symmetry class (s, p, and d), up to 38 virtual\nstates were calculated on a radial grid similar to the one used in section 4.\nIn tables 9 and 10 we report the excitation energies for the 11 lowest excitations of\nsinglet and triplet symmetry. As in helium, the orbital energies of the accurate potential lie\nalways in between the experimental singlet and triplet energies. However, the experimentally\nmeasured singlet-triplet separations in beryllium are much larger than in the helium atom\n(cf. the last columns given in tables 3 and 11). Accordingly, to achieve agreement with the\nexperimental data, appreciable shifts of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences are needed.\nFor the singlet excitation spectrum, given in table 9, the TDDFT corrections yield\nsignificantly improved excitation energies compared to spectrum of the bare Kohn-Sham\neigenvalue differences, with average errors reduced by a factor of about 3 regardless of\nwhich kernel is used. The most distinct improvement towards experiment is achieved for\nthe singlet 2P excitation, where the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue difference is off by 32% (61\nmHartree) from the experimental value.\nFor the remaining singlet excitations, the TDOEP-SIC kernel yields the best improvement upon the bare Kohn-Sham spectrum. From figure 2, where the errors for each singlet\nexcitation energy are plotted, we see two competing effects: the errors increase with progressing angular momentum (with the error of the 3d-states being largest), but decrease\nwith progressing principal quantum number n. Note that ALDA has the largest errors for\nthe d-states, presumably due to its inability to account for orbital nodes.\nFor the triplet spectrum given in table 10, the transition to the 2p state is clearly\nproblematic, presumably because of its small magnitude. In particular, the TDOEP X-only\ncalculation greatly underestimates the downshift away from the KS eigenvalue difference.\n16\n\n\fTable 9: Singlet excitation energies for the Be atom, calculated from the exact XC\nby using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (x-only) TDOEP (SIC)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\n2s \u2192 2p\n0.1327 0.2078 0.1889 0.2040\n0.1873\n0.2013 0.1855\n2s \u2192 3s\n0.2444 0.2526 0.2515 0.2574\n0.2553\n0.2566 0.2547\n2s \u2192 3p\n0.2694 0.2690 0.2714 0.2748\n0.2758\n0.2739 0.2750\n2s \u2192 3d\n0.2833 0.2783 0.2779 0.2851\n0.2851\n0.2843 0.2842\n2s \u2192 4s\n0.2959 0.2983 0.2984 0.2994\n0.2995\n0.2993 0.2994\n2s \u2192 4p\n0.3046 0.3045 0.3049 0.3063\n0.3067\n0.3061 0.3065\n2s \u2192 4d\n0.3098 0.3084 0.3084 0.3106\n0.3106\n0.3104 0.3103\n2s \u2192 5s\n0.3153 0.3163 0.3164 0.3168\n0.3170\n0.3167 0.3169\n2s \u2192 5p\n0.3193 0.3192 0.3194 0.3201\n0.3203\n0.3200 0.3202\n2s \u2192 6s\n0.3247 0.3252 0.3253 0.3254\n0.3256\n0.3254 0.3256\n2s \u2192 6p\n0.3269 0.3268 0.3269 0.3273\n0.3274\n0.3272 0.3273\nMean abs. dev.c 0.0081 0.0043 0.0031 0.0031\n0.0028\n0.0029 0.0029\nMean rel. dev.\n3.75% 1.69% 1.15% 1.27%\n1.09%\n1.13% 1.15%\nabs. dev.d\n0.0028 0.0033 0.0029 0.0025\n0.0025\n0.0024 0.0024\nrel. dev.d\n0.97% 1.14% 1.01% 0.87%\n0.86%\n0.86% 0.83%\na Using the lowest 38 unoccupied orbitals of s, p and d symmetry, respectively.\nb Experimental values from Ref.

All\nKohn-Sham orbital excitations experience a downshift in the ALDA and TDOEP X-only\ncalculation. In ALDA, this leads to an overall improvement of the spectrum by a more than a\nfactor of 2. The downshift in TDOEP X-only results is too strong, and this behavior is partly\ncorrected in the TDOEP-SIC. However, due to overcorrections for the higher excitation\nenergies, the average reduction in error over the Kohn-Sham excitation spectrum is only a\nfactor of 1.2.\nThe errors for the triplet excitation energies are plotted in figure 3. Clearly, the errors\nof both the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue spectrum and the corresponding corrections decrease\nagain with progressing quantum number. Together with the errors plotted in figure 2 this\nsignals that the Rydberg-like transitions to states with high principal quantum number n\nare already close to the eigenvalue differences of the accurate Kohn-Sham potential.\nThe singlet-triplet separations from equation (23) are given in table 11 for the three\ndifferent approximate XC kernels. Like in helium, the singlet-triplet splittings are overestimated by about a factor of two for the S and P transitions if the (diagonal) TDOEP x-only\nkernel is used. The splittings of the D levels, however, appear too small by about a factor\nof two. By the inclusion of correlation contributions to the kernels, the splittings of the S\nand P levels are consistently (and usually correctly) reduced. However, for the D states,\nthis correction is always too large, and leads to a reversal of the singlet and triplet energies.3\n3\n\nThis effect can also be observed in the Helium atom. The exact values of the singlet-triplet splittings of\nthe D states in helium however, are by two orders of magnitude smaller than in beryllium.\n\n17\n\n\fTable 10: Triplet excitation energies for the Be atom, calculated from the exact XC potential\nby using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (X-only) TDOEP (SIC)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nExpt. b\n2s \u2192 2p\n0.1327 0.0982 0.0902 0.0679\n0.0000\n0.0916 0.0795 0.1002\n2s \u2192 3s\n0.2444 0.2390 0.2387 0.2349\n0.2338\n0.2431 0.2430 0.2373\n2s \u2192 3p\n0.2694 0.2651 0.2651 0.2647\n0.2652\n0.2700 0.2705 0.2679\n2s \u2192 3d\n0.2833 0.2807 0.2805 0.2814\n0.2813\n0.2867 0.2865 0.2827\n2s \u2192 4s\n0.2959 0.2943 0.2943 0.2932\n0.2934\n0.2953 0.2953 0.2939\n2s \u2192 4p\n0.3046 0.3031 0.3032 0.3031\n0.3034\n0.3048 0.3049 0.3005\n2s \u2192 4d\n0.3098 0.3087 0.3087 0.3098\n0.3089\n0.3106 0.3107 0.3096\n2s \u2192 5s\n0.3153 0.3146 0.3146 0.3142\n0.3143\n0.3150 0.3150 0.3144\n2s \u2192 5p\n0.3193 0.3186 0.3187 0.3187\n0.3188\n0.3194 0.3194 0.3193\n2s \u2192 6s\n0.3247 0.3243 0.3243 0.3241\n0.3242\n0.3245 0.3245 0.3242\n2s \u2192 6p\n0.3269 0.3265 0.3265 0.3265\n0.3266\n0.3269 0.3269 0.3268\nMean abs. dev.c 0.0045 0.0012 0.0020 0.0040\n0.0102\n0.0026 0.0037\nMean rel. dev.\n3.53% 0.56% 1.28% 3.31%\n9.51%\n1.44% 2.55%\nabs. dev.d\n0.0017 0.0012 0.0012 0.0012\n0.0013\n0.0020 0.0020\nrel. dev.d\n0.63% 0.42% 0.41% 0.42%\n0.46%\n0.72% 0.74%\na Using the lowest 38 unoccupied orbitals of s, p and d symmetry, respectively.\nb Experimental values from Ref.

(40) which, in the SPA, hold for any system since\nthe diagonal terms of fxc\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 cancel, this behavior can be traced back to the overestimation\nof correlation contributions in LDA (in small systems). Self-interaction corrections are not\nexpected to cure this shortcoming, for the reason that to leading order the self-interaction\ncorrection terms cancel in the expressions for the splittings, similar to the way shown in\nsection 4. Accordingly, the separations in TDOEP-SIC and ALDA are of similar quality,\nwhich can be seen from columns one and three in table 11. The TDOEP X-only results on\nthe other hand, although too small, show the correct ordering of singlet and triplet levels.\nWith increasing excitation energy, the difference between the results in SPA and the full\nsolution is reduced, as was already observed in the case of helium. The drastic change of\nthe triplet 2P state in TDOEP X-only seems to be an artifact of the specific approximation\nto the exchange-correlation kernel, since the results in the SPA and the full calculation for\nthis particular excitation energy only differ by 10% if the ALDA is used for fxc\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 .\n5.2\n\nApproximate Kohn-Sham potentials\n\nThe results from using different approximate exchange-correlation potentials for the Be\natom to calculate the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and orbitals are given in tables 12 to 15.\nThe errors towards the experimental excitation energies are compiled in figures 2 and 3 for\nthe singlet and triplet series.

The errors are given in mHartrees. To guide the eye,\nthe errors of the discrete excitation energies were connected with lines.\n\n\"HOMO-LUMO\" gap is almost independent of the approximation of vxc employed. This is\nin sharp contrast with the He atom case. The correlation contributions cancel for the lowest\nexcitation energy, and we must classify this as a non-Rydberg state. For the higher states,\nthe situation is different: Starting from the excitation to the 3s level, the series of singleparticle energy differences appear almost uniformly shifted with respect to the series of the\nexact potential, preserving the typical pattern of their deviation from the experimentally\nmeasured spectrum. The shifts amount to -14 mH for the OEP-SIC potential, and -34\nmH for the X-only KLI potential. As in helium, these shifts are equal to the differences\nin the eigenvalues of the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital: For the accurate potential\n(\u01ebaccurate\n= \u22120.3426 a.u. [56]), the highest occupied orbitals are more strongly bound than\n2s\nX\u2212onlyKLI\nOEP\u2212SIC\nin OEP-SIC (\u01eb2s\n= \u22120.3285 a.u.) and in X-only KLI (\u01eb2s\n= \u22120.3089 a.u.).\nThus, among the virtual states, only the 2p orbital is appreciably influenced by the details\nof the ground state potential. For the higher lying states, the long-range behavior of the\nKohn-Sham potential dominates. Its \u22121/r behavior is correctly reproduced both in X-only\nKLI as well as in OEP-SIC.

To guide the eye,\nthe errors of the discrete excitation energies were connected with lines.\n\napproximated, but eventually, for any finite system, the Rydberg excitations will show errors\ndue to errors in the ionization potential. Casida et al.[23] have studied which excitations\ncan be well-approximated with present functional approximations to the potential.\nRegarding the corrections for the singlet excitation energies calculated from Eq. (23),\nthe first excited state (2p) experiences the largest correction, irrespective of the exchangecorrelation potential employed. Moreover, the results using different approximate exchangecorrelation kernels agree within 10 mH. For the remaining singlet excitation energies, the\ncalculated corrections using the approximate Kohn Sham orbitals are almost identical to the\ncorrections which are obtained from using the accurate Kohn-Sham orbitals. Hence, in figure\n2 the errors for the excitations to 3s through 6p show the same pattern of deviations, only\nshifted by the error in the respective eigenvalue of the 2s orbital. On average, the resulting\nsinglet excitation energies are closest to experiment, if the approximate exchange-correlation\npotential vxc is combined with the corresponding approximation of the exchange-correlation\nkernel fxc \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 .\nFrom tables 13 and 15 as well as from figure 3, the behavior of the triplet spectra is\n20\n\n6p\n\n\fTable 11: Singlet-triplet separations in beryllium calculated from the exact XC potential\nby using various approximate XC kernels.

For this particular state, the corrections spread on the order of 100mH, prevalently due to the significant overcorrection of the\nX-only TDOEP kernels. However, the resulting triplet 2p excitation energy almost exclusively depends on the approximation to the exchange correlation kernel rather than on the\nexchange-correlation potential employed. On the average, apart from the higher excitations\nin OEP-SIC (c.f. table 14), the best triplet spectra are obtained if the ALDA is used for\nthe exchange-correlation kernel, but this appears to be a fortuitous cancellation of errors.\nThe approximate Kohn-Sham excitation energies, except for the 2p state, are already incorrectly lower than the experimental triplet levels. Any further lowering, although correct for\nthe eigenvalue-differences of the exact Kohn-Sham potential, actually worsens the triplet\nspectra which are calculated on the basis of an approximate exchange-correlation potential.\nSince the shifts are reduced by correlation contributions in the kernels, the over-corrections\nbecome less severe for the ALDA and TDOEP-SIC kernels. Another apparent error cancellation is that when calculating the lowest excitation energy (2s \u2192 2p) from approximate\nexchange-correlation potentials, the SPA-results are always closer to experiment than the\nfull results. This might be related to the fact that for TDOEP X-only, SPA yields the exact\nfirst-order shift in energy levels in G\u00f6rling-Levy perturbation theory[57], while the \"full\"\ncalculation does not[48]. In cases where there are large differences between SPA and full\nresults, the SPA might be more reliable for these reasons.\nThe fact that the corrections to the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences only weakly\ndepend on the approximation of the exchange-correlation potential vxc , is also reflected\nin table 16, where the singlet-triplet separations in Be, calculated using the X-only KLI\n21\n\n\fTable 12: Singlet excitation energies for the Be atom, calculated from the X-only KLI\npotential by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (X-only)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nExpt. b\n2s \u2192 2p\n0.1297 0.1990 0.1795 0.1958\n0.1791\n0.1939\n2s \u2192 3s\n0.2162 0.2245 0.2232 0.2288\n0.2267\n0.2491\n2s \u2192 3p\n0.2405 0.2415 0.2449 0.2465\n0.2479\n0.2742\n2s \u2192 3d\n0.2527 0.2480 0.2476 0.2541\n0.2540\n0.2936\n2s \u2192 4s\n0.2638 0.2663 0.2664 0.2674\n0.2675\n0.2973\n2s \u2192 4p\n0.2725 0.2727 0.2735 0.2745\n0.2751\n0.3063\n2s \u2192 4d\n0.2773 0.2758 0.2759 0.2780\n0.2780\n0.3134\n2s \u2192 5s\n0.2822 0.2833 0.2834 0.2838\n0.2840\n0.3159\n2s \u2192 5p\n0.2863 0.2864 0.2867 0.2872\n0.2876\n0.3195\n2s \u2192 6s\n0.2913 0.2918 0.2919 0.2921\n0.2923\n0.325\n2s \u2192 6p\n0.2935 0.2936 0.2937 0.2940\n0.2942\n0.327\nMean abs. dev.c 0.0372 0.0311 0.0317 0.0288\n0.0299\nMean rel. dev.d\n13.5%\n10.4%\n10.7%\n9.5%\n10.1%\nabs. dev.d\n0.0345 0.0337 0.0334 0.0315\n0.0314\nrel. dev.d\n11.49% 11.18% 11.07% 10.39% 10.38%\na Using the lowest 38 unoccupied orbitals of s, p and d symmetry, respectively.\nb Experimental values from Ref.

We calculated the discrete optical spectra of helium and beryllium, two of the\nspectroscopically best known elements, using the exact exchange-correlation potential, the\nKLI-X-only potential and the the KLI-SIC potential for vxc (all three potentials are falling off\nlike \u22121/r as r \u2192 \u221e). These were combined with three approximations for the XC kernel:\nThe adiabatic LDA (ALDA), the TDOEP X-only kernel and the TDOEP-SIC kernel. The\nresults are given both in the single-pole approximation (SPA) and for a \"full\" calculation,\nwhere as many virtual states as possible (typically about 30 to 40) entered the calculation.\nThe analysis of these combinations reveals the following trends: First of all, the choice of vxc\non the calculated spectrum has the largest effect on the calculated spectra. The inaccuracies\nintroduced by approximate ground state Kohn-Sham potentials (even those including exact\nexchange) can be quite substantial. This is especially true for the higher excited states,\n22\n\n\fTable 13: Triplet excitation energies for the Be atom, calculated from the X-only KLI\npotential by using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (X-only)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nExpt. b\n2s \u2192 2p\n0.1297 0.0980 0.0907 0.0692\n0.0158\n0.1002\n2s \u2192 3s\n0.2162 0.2112 0.2108 0.2069\n0.2057\n0.2373\n2s \u2192 3p\n0.2405 0.2362 0.2363 0.2353\n0.2361\n0.2679\n2s \u2192 3d\n0.2527 0.2506 0.2505 0.2512\n0.2511\n0.2827\n2s \u2192 4s\n0.2638 0.2622 0.2622 0.2611\n0.2613\n0.2939\n2s \u2192 4p\n0.2725 0.2710 0.2711 0.2709\n0.2712\n0.3005\n2s \u2192 4d\n0.2773 0.2763 0.2763 0.2765\n0.2765\n0.3096\n2s \u2192 5s\n0.2822 0.2815 0.2816 0.2811\n0.2812\n0.3144\n2s \u2192 5p\n0.2863 0.2856 0.2857 0.2856\n0.2857\n0.3193\n2s \u2192 6s\n0.2913 0.2909 0.2909 0.2907\n0.2908\n0.3242\n2s \u2192 6p\n0.2935 0.2931 0.2932 0.2931\n0.2932\n0.3268\nMean abs. dev.c 0.0300 0.0291 0.0298 0.0323\n0.0371\nMean rel. dev.\n11.8%\n9.9%\n10.6% 12.8%\n17.6%\nabs. dev.d\n0.0300 0.0318 0.0318 0.0324\n0.0324\nrel. dev.d\n10.1% 10.7% 10.7% 11.0%\n11.0%\na Using the lowest 38 unoccupied orbitals of s, p and d symmetry, respectively.\nb Experimental values from Ref.

We observe that\nthis shift is closely related to the absolute value of the highest occupied eigenvalue, which,\nin exact DFT, is equal to the first ionization potential of the system at hand.\nFor the lower excitation energies, an error cancellation occurs, making these excitations\nless sensitive to the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. This error cancellation\nhowever, ceases to work the more the excited states behave like Rydberg states. For Helium,\nthis is already the case for the first excited state. Hence, in improving the calculation of\nexcitation energies from TDDFT requires an improved exchange-correlation potential in the\nfirst place. The most important requirement for such a potential would be that its highest\noccupied eigenvalue reproduces the experimental ionization potential as closely as possible.\nEmpirically, one could introduce a \"scissors-operator\" similar to the one introduced by Levine\nand Allan [58], which shifts the Rydberg states by a constant being equal to the difference\nbetween the highest occupied eigenvalue and the negative of the experimental ionization\npotential. But such a procedure would not produce a first-principles calculation. In our\nopinion however, the construction of approximate exchange-correlation potentials based on\norbital functionals would be the method of choice for the future.\nThe effect of the choice of the exchange-correlation kernel on the calculated spectra,\nin turn, is much less pronounced. However, its relative importance increases whenever the\n\"first-order\" effects, originating from vxc cancel. This is the case for the values of the\nsinglet-triplet splittings and the lower excitation energies of Be. For these \"second-order\neffects\", the correlation contributions contained in fxc are important. We observe that the\n23\n\n\fTable 14: Singlet excitation energies for the Be atom, calculated from the SIC-KLI potential\nby using approximate XC kernels (in atomic units)\nALDA (xc)\nTDOEP (SIC)\nk\u2192j\n\u03c9jk\nSPA\nfulla\nSPA\nfulla\nExpt. b\n2s \u2192 2p\n0.1314 0.2030 0.1839 0.1968 0.1811 0.1939\n2s \u2192 3s\n0.2300 0.2390 0.2377 0.2429 0.2409 0.2491\n2s \u2192 3p\n0.2561 0.2566 0.2596 0.2614 0.2627 0.2742\n2s \u2192 3d\n0.2684 0.2632 0.2628 0.2694 0.2693 0.2936\n2s \u2192 4s\n0.2820 0.2844 0.2846 0.2855 0.2856 0.2973\n2s \u2192 4p\n0.2909 0.2910 0.2916 0.2926 0.2931 0.3063\n2s \u2192 4d\n0.2956 0.2943 0.2943 0.2961 0.2962 0.3134\n2s \u2192 5s\n0.3013 0.3023 0.3025 0.3028 0.3030 0.3159\n2s \u2192 5p\n0.3054 0.3054 0.3056 0.3062 0.3064 0.3195\n2s \u2192 6s\n0.3106 0.3112 0.3113 0.3114 0.3116\n0.325\n2s \u2192 6p\n0.3129 0.3129 0.3130 0.3133 0.3134\n0.327\nMean abs. dev.c 0.0210 0.0155 0.0153 0.0130 0.0138\nMean rel. dev.d 8.07% 5.29% 5.25% 4.32% 4.78%\nabs. dev.d\n0.0168 0.0161 0.0158 0.0140 0.0139\nrel. dev.d\n5.65% 5.35% 5.26% 4.60% 4.60%\na Using the lowest 38 unoccupied orbitals of s, p and d symmetry, respectively.\nb Experimental values from Ref.

Besides the missing frequency\ndependence, correlation contributions are hard to model on top of an exact exchange treatment and one might speculate that the ALDA takes advantage from a fortuitous error\ncancellation between exchange and correlation effects. Again, we expect only orbital functionals to manage a marked improvement over the ALDA, which, up to now, can has been\nthe workhorse of TDDFT.\nFinally, the inevitable truncation of the space of virtual excitations is appreciable only for\nthe lowest lying states. In most cases, the results of the single-pole approximation (SPA),\nwhich, in the nondegenrate case, merely requires a pair of \"initial\" and \"final\" KS states\nare close to the results obtained from using more configurations.\nWe thank C.
