We conclude that the simulations reproduce various observational features reasonably well. An important implication suggested by our results is that the \"turbulence\" within the cold interstellar atomic gas is mainly the result of individual\nlong living cloudlet (confined by an external warm medium) motions rather than supersonic turbulence within nearly isothermal\nclouds. Another important aspect is that the CNM structures produced in the simulation present various physical characteristics\nthat are similar to the characteristics of the molecular clouds. This raises the question as to whether the physical properties of\nthe molecular clouds are determined at a very early stage, before the gas becomes molecular.\nKey words.

Introduction\nSince its first use in the 1950s (Ewen & Purcell, 1951)\nthe 21 cm transition of atomic hydrogen (HI) has been\nextensively used (e.g. Crovisier 1981, Kulkarni & Heiles\n1987, Dickey & Lockman 1990, Joncas et al. 1992) to study\nthe neutral atomic interstellar gas by numerous authors.\nRecent data have considerably improved our knowledge\nof this medium. Heiles & Troland (2003, 2005), using the\nArecibo telescope, have done an extensive survey of HI\nclouds which has given reliable statistical results. To diSend offprint requests to: E. Audit, P. Hennebelle\ne-mail: edouard.audit@cea.fr, patrick.hennebelle@ens.fr\n\nrectly probe smaller scales of HI emission, various studies\nhave been done using interferometers. Miville-Desch\u00eanes\net al. (2003) and Taylor et al. (2003) use the Dominion\nRadio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) interferometer, Stil et al. (2006) use the Very Large Array (VLA)\nwhereas McClure-Griffiths et al. (2005) use the Australian\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA).\nThe observations of HI have revealed its complex\nmulti-phase nature. In HI, cold and dense (CNM) structures are embedded in a warm (WNM) phase, with which\nthere are approximately in pressure equilibrium, as predicted by detailed computations of thermal balance (Field\net al. 1969, Wolfire et al. 1995, 2003). The observa-\n\n\f2\n\nHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\ntions have also revealed that this multi-phase medium is\nstrongly turbulent making their interpretations even more\nchallenging and indispensable the use of adapted numerical simulations.\nNumerous numerical studies of the large scale ISM\n(e.g. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 1995, Rosen & Bregman\n1995, de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005a) and of the molecular clouds (e.g. MacLow & Klessen 2004) have been performed over the years and comparisons between observations and simulations have been carried out both for large\nscale simulations (e.g. Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2002, de\nAvillez & Breitschwerdt 2005b) and for molecular clouds\n(Padoan et al. 2003, Ossenkopf & Mac Low 2002).\nIt is, however, only recently that numerical simulations\ndevoted to the description of the warm and the dense\natomic gas with a numerical resolution sufficient to describe the physical scales of the problem (i.e. the CNM\nstructures and the Field length) have been performed\n(Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999, 2000, Koyama & Inutsuka\n2000, 2002, Audit & Hennebelle 2005, hereafter paper I,\nHeitsch et al. 2005, 2006, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2006).\nFor this reason, no tight comparison between observations\nand theory have yet been carried out for HI at scales below\n10 pc.\nIn a companion paper (Hennebelle & Audit 2006, here\nafter paper II), we present 2D high resolution numerical\nsimulations aiming to describe self-consistently a turbulent atomic hydrogen flow from scales of few tens of parsec\ndown to hundredth of parsec. The high resolution which is\nnecessary to describe properly HI permits to obtain a good\nstatistical description of the flow and to reach small scales\nclose to the size of various small scale structures that have\nbeen observed in HI, like the so-called tiny small atomic\nstructure (TSAS) and low column density clouds recently\nobserved by Braun & Kanekar (2005) and Stanimirovi\u0107\n& Heiles (2005). Therefore, in spite of the fact that these\nsimulations are only bidimensional, they constitute a good\nstarting point to carry out preliminary comparisons with\nthe available HI data. Note that the dynamics of spatial\nscales which is covered by these simulations is about ten\ntimes larger than what can be done in 3D yet.\nIn this paper, we attempt to further characterize the\nresults of the numerical simulations presented in paper\nII and to perform comparisons between these simulations and the HI observations obtained in the Millennium\nArecibo 21 centimeter absorption-line survey (Heiles &\nTroland 2003, 2005) since various interesting statistical informations have been extracted from these data. We also\nmake a special effort to provide enough material to allow\nthe observers to make easier the comparisons with their\nobservations. In Sect. 2, we present some statistics of column density and velocity along the lines of sight since\nthis information is the most direct observable. In Sect. 3,\nwe present various examples of synthetic atomic hydrogen 21cm line spectra in emission and absorption, showing\nin each case the corresponding density and velocity fields\nalong the line of sight. We discuss the influence of the\nconvolution by a Gaussian beam of various width on the\n\nFig. 1. Top panel: column density, N , along the lines of\nsight as a function of position.

Finally, we focus in Sect. 4 on the CNM\nstructures formed in the simulations and their properties\ntrying to make the link with some of the cloud properties\navailable from the Millennium survey. Section 5 concludes\nthe paper.\n\n2. Lines of sight\nIn paper II, the structure of the flow which results from the\nnumerical simulation has been characterized by the probability distribution function of the density and pressure\nas well as by computing the velocity and density powerspectra and the energy spectrum. However, although very\ninformative, these quantities are not easily obtained from\nthe observations (and if so, would rely on various assumptions). On the other hand, column density and average\nvelocity along the line of sight are more straightforwardly\ninferred from observational signals. Thus, we attempt here\nto further characterize the flow structure by giving some\nstatistics of the column density and the velocity along the\nlines of sight. Since our experimental setup is strongly\nanisotropic (the flow enters from the left and right box\nfaces and leaves from the top and bottom faces), we always show the results obtained along the x-axis and along\nthe y-axis.\n\n2.1. Line of sight characteristics\nTop panel of Fig. 1 shows the column density, N , along\nthe y-axis as a function of the x-coordinate (full line) as\nwell as the column density along the x-axis as a function\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\n3\n\nFig. 3.

All the lines of sight\navailable in the simulation, i.e. 10000, are displayed. The\naverage value is about 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . These values are\ncomparable to several values quoted in the literature for\nhigh latitude lines of sight (e.g. Heiles & Troland 2003) and\nindicate that the total amount of gas in the simulations is\ncomparable to the total amount of gas along these lines of\nsight. We note, however, that only 20-30 % of the lines of\nsight quoted by Heiles & Troland have such low column\ndensity. Our simulation is therefore representative of the\nmost diffuse lines of sight.\nR Bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the integrated quantity\nn/T dl along x and y-axis. This quantity which traces\nmainly the CNM is directly obtained by HI 21cm line absorption spectra. An estimate of the CNM column density\ncan be directly obtained by multiplying this quantity by\nthe CNM temperature which is about 50 K. Again the\nvalues obtained are very similar to the values quoted by\nHeiles & Troland (2003) for the lines of sight having total\nHI column densities of about 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 .\nTop panel of Fig. 2 shows the average velocity along\nthe line of sight defined as:\nP\n\u03c1v\n(1)\n< v0 >= P ,\n\u03c1\nwhereas bottom panel of Fig. 2 shows the velocity dispersion along the line of sight:\nP\n\u03c1(v \u2212 v0 )2\n2\nP\n< \u03b4v >=\n.\n(2)\n\u03c1\nThe mean velocity is close to zero (0.05 km/s for lines of\nsight parallel to y-axis and 0.39 km/s for lines of sight\n\nparallel to x-axis) although significant fluctuations (up to\n2 km/s) are present, the standard deviation is 0.9 and 0.7\nkm/s for lines of sight parallel to y and x-axis, respectively.\nThe velocity dispersion along the lines of sight is significantly larger. The mean value is about 2.29 and 2.5 km/s\nalong y and x-axis respectively, whereas the standard variation is about 0.7 km/s in both cases. Interestingly, adopting a CNM sound speed of 0.7 km/s, these values correspond to a Mach number of about M = 2.5 km/s / 0.7\nkm/s \u2243 3.5 which is similar to the values obtained for the\nCNM clouds by Crovisier (1981) and Heiles & Troland\n(2003).\n\n2.2. Line of sight statistics\nHere, we present statistics of lines of sight. Figure 3 displays the histogram of total column density along x and\ny-axis (full lines) and of CNM (defined as gas having temperature lower than 200 K) column density (dotted lines).\nAlthough our simulation described a coherent region of\n20 pc, whereas the lines of sight of the Millennium survey\nare not correlated, it is worth doing some comparison with\nFig. 7 of Heiles & Troland (2003). Their first panel shows\nthat CNM column density peaks at \u2243 1.5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 close\nto our case (\u2243 1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ). We find that about 20% of\nlines of sight have a small (< 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 ) column density of CNM, whereas Heiles & Troland find about 30 %\nof such lines of sight (first panel of their Fig. 7). They find\nthat the total HI column density peaks at about 2 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 , which is close to what we find as well. They find no\nline of sight with column density smaller than \u2243 1 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 . In our case the smallest column density is about\n7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . Note that the smallest column density of\natomic gas observed in the Galaxy is about 4.5 \u00d7 1019\ncm\u22122 (Lockman et al. 1986).\nFigure 4 shows the histogram of the fraction, r of\nWNM (full lines), CNM (dotted lines), thermally unstable gas (dashed lines) along the lines of sight, e.g.\nrcnm = nc,cnm/nc,tot.

Top (Bottom) panel is for line of sight parallel\nto y-axis (x-axis). The fraction of CNM can be compared\nwith bottom panel of Fig. 7 from Heiles & Troland (2003).\nAgain both appear to be similar. The median value in our\ncase is about 0.34, whereas Heiles & Troland quote 0.3.\nWe have about 10% of lines of sight for which the fraction\nof CNM is smaller than 0.05 and they find about 30% of\nlines of sight with no CNM. We have about 30% of lines\nof sight with a fraction of CNM larger than 0.5, whereas\nthey find this fraction to be about 10%.\nFigure 5 displays the fraction of CNM, rcnm , as a function of the total column density along the line of sight. It\ncan be compared with Fig. 8 of Heiles & Troland (2003).\nA similar trend is observed in both cases, rcnm increases\n\nFig. 6. Fraction of lines of sight which contain a gas particle of a given gas density (upper panel) and mean column\ndensity along the line of sight (bottom panel) of gas having a given density (only lines of sight which contain a\nfluid particle of the corresponding density are taken into\naccount). Full lines represent lines of sight parallel to the\ny-axis whereas dotted lines represent lines of sight parallel\nto x-axis.\n\nwith the total column density. However, the observations\nappear to have a dispersion larger than the simulation results. This could possibly be a consequence of the fact that\nthe observations probe several regions which are physically\nuncorrelated.\nAltogether, these numbers appear to be similar. One\nshould however keep in mind that our statistics are based\non correlated lines of sight, whereas the lines of sight observed in the Millennium survey represent regions with a\npriori different physical conditions. As emphasized in paper I, physical conditions like external triggering and level\nof turbulence do influence the physical parameters of the\nflow as the CNM/WNM fractions. Indeed, since the region\nthat we are simulating is actively forming CNM structures,\nit is unsurprising that the number of lines of sight with\nno CNM is underestimated and the fraction of lines of\nsight dominated by CNM is overestimated. Nevertheless,\nthe relatively good agreement suggests that the numerical\nsetup we used leads to a reasonably realistic medium.\nAnother useful statistics is the number of lines of sight\nwhich cross a piece of fluid of a given density, n. The result is shown on top panel of Fig. 6 (logarithmic intervals\nof density are used). While most lines of sight intercept\nfluid particles of density between 0.5 and 100 cm\u22123 , there\nis about 10% lines of sight which cross gas denser than\n1000 cm\u22123 and less than 0.1% which cross gas denser\nthan 104 cm\u22123 . In particular, these results suggest that\nthe so-called TSAS (Heiles 1997) are somehow rare events\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\nas suggested by Stanimirov\u0131\u0301c et al. (2003) and Johnstone\net al. (2003), even if quantitative prediction should be considered with great care.\nFinally, an interesting question is: when a line of sight\ncrosses a fluid particle of a given density, what is the mean\ncolumn density of gas at this density along the line of\nsight ? The result is shown in the second panel of Fig. 6\n(note that we have plotted the mean column density of\ngas at given density, \u03c10 along lines of sight which do\nintercept a fluid particle of density such that log\u03c10 and\nlog\u03c10 + dlog\u03c10 ). While the mean column densities of gas\nat density 1-2 cm\u22123 and \u2243100 cm\u22123 are approximately\nequal to about 3\u00d71019 cm\u22122 , the mean column densities\nof gas denser than 103 cm\u22123 are about 2 to 3 times larger.\nThis means that, although few lines of sight intercept fluid\nparticles denser than 103 cm\u22123 , when it is the case, the\ncolumn density of the dense gas is usually a significant\nfraction of the total column density along the line of sight.\n\n3. HI spectra\n3.1. Emission and absorption\nSince HI spectra provide most of the available information\non the interstellar atomic hydrogen, we give here various\nexamples of synthetic HI spectra calculated from the numerical simulation, in emission and in absorption. This is\ncertainly the most straightforward way of comparing observations and simulations. Figure 7 shows the density and\nthe velocity fields along 4 lines of sight parallel to the xaxis (only half of the box simulation is displayed since the\nother half contains only WNM and no CNM structure) as\nwell as the 21cm line emission and extinction.\nThe first case (top panels) shows a line of sight with\nlow density CNM structures (\u2243 30 cm\u22123 ). Two groups of\nclouds can be seen (x \u2243 5.5 and \u2243 6 pc), each of them\nbeing strongly substructured. The relative velocity of the\ntwo groups of clouds is about 5 km/s and each of them\npresents an internal velocity dispersion of a few km/s. In\nspite of this complexity, the emission spectrum appears to\nbe relatively smooth. This is a consequence of the fact that\nthe thermal broadening of the HI 21cm line emission is not\nsmall compared to the turbulent broadening. The large\ncomponent of width \u2243 20 km/s is the WNM emission. The\ntwo narrow components seen in emission and in absorption\nare due to the contribution of the two groups of clouds.\nThe largest extinction is about 0.007 and the width of the\nlines is typically around 3-5 km/s. These numbers are very\nsimilar to the numbers quoted in Braun & Kanekar (2005)\nand Stanimirovi\u0107 & Heiles (2005).\nThe second case (second line of panels) shows a line\nof sight which contains four CNM structures of density\nhigher than 100 cm\u22123 . Whereas three of them (x \u2243 2.5,\nx \u2243 3.2 and x \u2243 5.5 pc) present a modest velocity dispersion of few km/s with respect to the others, one of them\n(located at x \u2243 5 pc) moves at a velocity of about 4 km/s\nwith respect to the other. As a consequence, the corresponding HI spectra present two peaks, the first one (v \u2243\n\n5\n\n1 km/s) being due to the contribution of the three structures moving at approximately the same velocities and\nthe second (v \u2243 4 km/s) being due to the fourth structure\n(x \u2243 5 pc). Whereas the first peak is slightly broadened\nby the velocity dispersion of the 3 structures, the width\nof the second one is mainly thermal.\nThe third case shows about 10 CNM structures denser\nthan 100 cm\u22123 and about the same number of CNM structures having a lower density. A velocity gradient of about\n1 km/s/pc takes place between x \u2243 1 and x \u2243 6 pc. As a\nconsequence, the HI spectra present a single peak, instead\nof 2 in the preceding cases, which is significantly broadened by the velocity dispersion of the structures. Note that\nthis spectrum is qualitatively similar (temperature, extinction and shape) to the spectra shown by Heiles (2001)\nexcept for the width which is 2 times larger than the case\npresented here.\nThe fourth case shows a line of sight which crosses\nthe highest density reached in Fig. 1 of paper II (x \u2243\n1.65 pc and y \u2243 7.07pc). The HI 21cm line is strongly\nsaturated because of the large column density. The spectra\nare again broadened by the velocity dispersion between\nCNM structures. Again, the complex structure of the flow\ncannot be easily recovered from the HI spectra which are\nrelatively smooth.\nFigure 8 shows four lines of sight along the yaxis. Indeed, since our experimental setup is strongly\nanisotropic, it is worth to see what are the consequences\nof this anisotropy on the synthetic HI spectra. In particular, along the y-axis few uncorrelated groups of structures\ncan contribute to the synthetic signals. This is well illustrated by the first, second and third cases in which 3 to\n5 groups of structures are present. Each group presents\nan internal velocity dispersion of a few km/s and an average velocity with respect to the other groups which can\nbe as high as \u2243 5 km/s. Interestingly, this is somehow\nsimilar to the structures obtained by Hennebelle & Passot\n(2006) in the case where significant Alfv\u00e9n waves are initially present in the flow. Whereas in their case, this was\ndue to the effect of Alfv\u00e9n waves which tend to subfragment the CNM structures, here the subfragmentation of\nthe group of structures is likely due to the turbulent fluctuations. As a consequence, the synthetic spectra are on\naverage broader than the spectra obtained along the x-axis\n(factor \u2243 1.3 \u2212 1.5).\nThe fourth case (Fig. 8) corresponds to the line of sight\nparallel to the y-axis which crosses the highest density\nreached in the simulation. As for the fourth case (Fig. 7),\nthe 21cm line is strongly saturated. The narrow peak seen\nin emission is produced by the strong density fluctuation\n(located at x \u2243 7 pc) which is also displayed in Fig. 5 of\npaper II. As explained in paper II, we believe that this\nstructure is a good candidate to explain the TSAS observed in the atomic gas. This spectrum could therefore\nconstitute a typical signature of such event. Note that in\nthe fourth case of Fig. 7, this narrow component is not\nseen because in front of it, stands a less dense structure\n(\u2243 103 cm\u22123 ) which has a high extinction.

Effect of finite resolution\nHere, we investigate the effect of finite resolution on the HI\nemission spectra. We convolve the HI spectra calculated\nalong the lines of sight by Gaussian functions of various\nwidths at half maximum, b. Figure 9 shows the results.\nFour series of spectra showing the influence of a finite resolution are displayed. The full line of first panel of each\nseries shows the same spectra as those shown in Fig. 8,\n(left-top series of spectra is first case of Fig. 8, left-bottom\nis second case, right-top is third case, whereas left-bottom\nis fourth case). The full line of second, third and fourth\npanels of each series shows the spectra obtained by convolving the spectrum distribution by a Gaussian function\nof width at half maximum equal to b = 10, 20 and 40 respectively. The dotted (dashed) lines of each panel show\nthe unsmoothed spectra shifted from the central position\nby \u2206 =-5 (5), -10 (10), -20 (20) and -40 (40) cells respectively.\nLeft-top series (first case of Fig. 8) show that there\nis a significant variability of the HI 21cm emission spectra when different lines of sight are selected (dotted and\ndashed lines). This has severe consequences on the convolved spectra which vary significantly when the width\nat half maximum of the Gaussian function used for the\nconvolution, increases. As can be seen, the shape of the\nunconvolved spectra (first panel) is rather different from\nthe shape obtained with b = 10, 20 and 40.\nLeft-bottom series (second case of Fig. 8) and right-top\nseries (third case of Fig. 8) show cases for which the variability of the spectra is much less important than in the\nprevious case. The general shape of the convolved spectra\n(full lines) does not change much, the fluctuations appear\nto be on average smaller than \u2243 10% with some stronger\nfluctuations of about \u2243 20 \u2212 30%. The difference between\nthis behaviour and what has been found in the previous\ncase, is largely due to the fact that the CNM structures are\nmuch smaller in the latter than in the former. Therefore\nthe spatial length over which the column density varies\nsignificantly, is also smaller in left-top case than in these\n2 cases, making the dependency on the lobe effect more\nimportant.\nRight-bottom series (fourth case of Fig. 8) show also\nsignificant variability in spite of the large emission value.\nThis is due to the fact that the line of sight (\u2206 = 0) crosses\na small scale and dense structure (seen in Fig. 5 of paper\nII) which results from a strong collision between 2 CNM\nstructures. Therefore, as indicated in Fig. 6, the column\ndensity varies significantly along the line of sight in few\ncells.\nOn average, the smoothed spectra are not much\nbroader than the unsmoothed one. This is certainly a consequence of the fact that the velocity dispersion along the\n\nFig. 10. Mass of the structures as a function of their size.\nOne finds the relation M \u221d L\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2243 1.7.\nlines of sight presents variations which are smaller than\nits average value (Sect. 2.1).\n\n4. Clouds properties\nIn paper II, the mass spectrum of the structures formed\nin the simulation has been measured and theoretical arguments to explain it, have been presented. Here, we further\nstudy the structures properties. First, we consider the case\nof structures simply defined by the clipping procedure explained in paper I and II. Second in order to quantify the\nfact that the structures are spatially correlated and not\nrandomly distributed, we investigate some properties of\ngroups of structures.\n\n4.1. Properties of individual clouds\nWe study various structure properties which could be compared with observations or with other theoretical works.\nWe pay special attention to the distribution of column\ndensity within clouds, since an interesting observational\nresult has been obtained by Heiles & Troland (2005) with\nwhich comparison is possible.\np In the following, we define the cloud size, L, as L =\nI1 /M , where M is the cloud mass whereas I1 is the\nhighest inertial momentum (I2 being the smallest), i.e.\nthe highest\neigenvalueRof the inertial matrix, I, defined\nas\nR\nR\nIxx = y 2 dm, Iyy = x2 dm and Ixy = Iyx = \u2212 xydm.\n\n4.1.1. Mass-size relation and size distribution\nAn interesting property for cloud characterization is the\nmass-size relation. Figure 10 shows the mass of the structure as a function of their size. A clear correlation is seen,\nleading to the relation M \u221d L\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2243 1.7.\nSince, as will be seen below, this relation turns out\nto be useful to understand the column density distribution, it is worth to understand its physical origin.\nFor this purpose, we consider the distribution function,\nN (L), of structures of size L. The number of structures\nof size between L and L + dL is equal to the num-\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\n9\n\nFig. 9.

The solid line\nshows the average value per density interval.\nber of structures of mass between M and M + dM ,\nN (L)dL = N (M )dM where M \u221d L\u03b3 . In paper II, we\nobtain that N (M ) \u221d M \u2212\u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2243 1.7. Therefore, we\nhave: N (L) = N (M ) dM/dL \u221d L\u2212\u03b2\u03b3+\u03b3\u22121. With the values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 given above, we have: \u2212\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2212 1 \u2243 \u22122.19.\nThis implies that N (L)L2 \u2243 L\u22120.19 , i.e. the number of\nstructures of a given scale L within a (bidimensional) volume L2 , is almost the same as the number of structures of\nscale L\u2032 within a volume L\u20322 . This implies that the flow is\nnearly scale-invariant (see Elmegreen 1997 and Padoan &\nNordlund 2002). This is likely a consequence of the flow\nbeing turbulent, although in the present problem, there\nare characteristic scales which may explain the deviation\nfrom the scale-invariant behaviour. Another possibility is\nthat the size of the simulation is still insufficient and the\nnumerical mesh, as well as the injection scale, still have\nan influence.\n\nFig. 13. Number of lines of sight (crossing a single CNM\nstructure) per logarithmic column density interval. Full\nline corresponds to the (104 )2 cells simulation, dotted line\nis for the (5000)2 one, dashed line is for the (2500)2 cells\nsimulation.\nimately constant and equal to about 0.4 until M \u2243 0.1\nMs /pc. It then increases to about 0.6 for larger mass.\nNevertheless we note that there is a considerable dispersion, some structures being very elongated.\nAnother related question is the shape of the very dense\nregions observed in the simulations (see section 3.2 of paper II). Since this high density component is created by\nshocks, it is expected that these regions should be very\nelongated. Figure 12 shows the aspect ratio of these regions as a function of the peak density (note that since\nthese regions are rare, 6 time steps have been used to\nprovide this plot) and confirms that these structures are\nelongated with a mean aspect ratio of about \u2243 0.3. We\nnote that a significant fraction of them has an aspect ratio smaller than 0.2, which is significantly smaller than the\nmean aspect ratio of unshocked CNM structures. Indeed\nvery few CNM clouds have an aspect ratio smaller than\n0.2. This suggests that this could constitute an interesting test for the assumption of TSAS being shocked CNM\nstructures.\n\n4.2. Column density distribution of clouds\nIn the quest for comparison between observations and\nsimulations, an interesting result obtained by Heiles &\nTroland (2005), appears to deserve special attention.\nHeiles & Troland show that the column density distribution of their CNM structures follows the relation N (N ) \u221d\n1/N . In this section, we study in some details the column\ndensity distribution of the CNM structures and propose a\ntheoretical explanation for this relation.\n\n4.2.1. Numerical results\n4.1.2. Cloud shape\nFigure\n11 shows the aspect ratio of the cloud defined as\np\nI2 /I1 . The solid line represents the mean value per logarithmic mass interval. The mean aspect ratio is approx-\n\nHere, we display the column density distribution, N (N )\nobtained by putting together the column density distribution of all the structures identified in our simulation. The\nresult is shown in Fig. 13 which shows the number of lines\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\n11\n\nof sight, nl , per logarithmic interval of column density,\ndnl /dlogN = N dnl /dN = N N (N ), for various numerical\nresolutions.\nThe low column density part is obviously spoiled by\nnumerical resolution effects. In the intermediate part, say\nbetween 3 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 and \u2243 3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , the distribution does not appear to depend on the numerical resolution for lg > 5000. This suggests that in this range of\ncolumn density, numerical convergence has been reached.\nOn the contrary, the high column density part strongly depends on the numerical resolution. In particular the higher\nthe resolution, the larger the number of lines of sight having high column density. We therefore believe that only\nthe intermediate column density part is physically significant.\nAs can be seen from the highest resolution simulation\n(solid line) displayed in Fig. 13, the column density distribution is stiffer between 1.5 \u00d7 1019 and 3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 than\nbetween 1.5 \u00d7 1018 and 1.5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . Since there is no\nclear physical reason for this to be true, this is most likely\na numerical effect due to the finite size of our numerical\nexperiment. Since the size of the simulation box is only 20\npc and the WNM density about 0.8 cm\u22123 , it is indeed difficult to produce structures with column density equal to,\nor higher, than about 20\u00d73.08\u00d71018 \u00d70.8 \u2243 5\u00d71019 cm\u22122 .\nTherefore one expects that the number of big structures\nand therefore the number of lines of sight with large column density drop above a certain threshold. The value of\nthis threshold for the column density is certainly smaller\nthan \u2243 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . This is in good agreement with\nwhat has been found in paper II for the mass spectrum\n(Figure 15) which presents a cutoff for high mass as well.\nTherefore, we believe that the most reliable part of the\ncolumn density distribution is the one between \u2243 1.5\u00d71018\nand 1.5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . Note that this range of column density corresponds to the part of the mass distribution, (Fig.\n15-18 of paper II) for which numerical convergence has\nbeen reached. The solid line shows that between 1.5 \u00d7 1018\nand 1.5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , one has about N (N ) \u221d 1/N 1.15 \u2243\n1/N 1.2 which is slightly stiffer but nevertheless close to\nthe N (N ) \u221d 1/N distribution. Although the disagreement\nappears to be statistically significant (Heiles 2006, Private\nCommunication), it appears to be mainly due to the column densities larger than 1020 cm\u22122 , which we cannot\nprobe here. It is also possible that the column density distribution is biased because of large column density components being blends of two smaller components or because\nof small column density being missed (Heiles 2006, Private\nCommunication).\nNote that Heiles & Troland (2005) infer N (N ) \u221d 1/N\nfor N between 2 \u00d7 1018 and 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . The reason of\nthis disagreement is probably due, at least in part, to the\nnumerical setup and most likely to the finite spatial range\nof our simulation box. Future studies using larger box size\nand larger numerical resolution, may give answer to these\nquestions.\n\nFig. 14. Average column density of the structures as a\nfunction of their mass. One finds the relation < N >\u221d M \u03b7\nwith \u03b7 \u2243 0.52.\n\n4.2.2. Physical explanation\nHere, we propose a physical explanation for the column\ndensity distribution, N (N ) \u221d N \u2212\u03b1 .\nFor this purpose, we make the assumption that the\nclouds are sufficiently uniform for us to consider that the\ncolumn density within the cloud does not strongly fluctuate. Figure 14 displays the mean structure column density\nas a function of their mass, M . A very good agreement is\nobtained with the relation < N >\u221d M 0.5 .\nThis result can be understood as follows. Let us consider a spherical CNM cloud of uniform density n. Its mass\ncan be written M \u2243 nL2 and the column density N \u2243 nL.\nThus < N >\u221d M \u03b7 with \u03b7 = 0.5. In the case we are considering, M \u221d L\u03b3 which implies that the CNM structures\nare not spherical clouds with uniform density. To fix idea,\nwe consider 2 cases.\nFirst, the CNM clouds are roughly roundish but the\ndensity is not uniform because the internal structure is\ncomplex. The number of lines of sight crossing the structure is proportional to L, thus the mean column density\nfollows < N >\u221d L\u03b3\u22121 \u221d M (\u03b3\u22121)/\u03b3 . With \u03b3 = 1.7, we\nhave (\u03b3 \u2212 1)/\u03b3 \u2243 0.41.\nSecond, the CNM clouds are filaments with uniform\ndensity. The major axis has a length L, whereas the minor axis has a length L\u03b3\u22121 . If the filament is seen along\nthe minor axis, the mean column density again follows\n< N >\u221d L\u03b3\u22121 \u221d M (\u03b3\u22121)/\u03b3 . If the filament is seen along\nthe major axis, then < N >\u221d L \u221d M 1/\u03b3 with 1/\u03b3 \u2243 0.59.\nSince all the values found are slightly above or slightly\nbelow 0.5, it is not surprising to find \u03b7 \u2243 0.5.\nThe number of lines of sight crossing a structure of\ncolumn density between N and N + dN is proportional\nto the number of structures having a mass between M\nand M + dM times the length of the structures (since the\nnumber of line of sight crossing a structure of size L is\nproportional to L). Thus we have: N (N )dN \u221d N (M ) \u00d7\nM 1/\u03b3 \u00d7 dM . This leads to N (N ) \u2243 N (\u2212\u03b2+1/\u03b3+1\u2212\u03b7)/\u03b7 .\nSince with \u03b2=1.7, \u03b3=1.7 and \u03b7=0.5 we have \u2212(\u2212\u03b2 +1/\u03b3 +\n\n\f12\n\nHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b7)/\u03b7 \u2243 1.22, we get: N (N ) \u221d 1/N 1.22 . This value is\nremarkably close to what is measured in the simulation.\nThe good agreement between the analytical value and\nthe exponent measured in the simulation, suggests the validity of the approach. However, since we used the value\n\u03b3, inferred from the simulation, it could be that its value\nis different in the ISM (as previously discussed, the size of\nthe computational box or the numerical resolution could\nbe insufficient). In particular, it could be, that real atomic\nflows are closer from strict scale invariance than what\nhas been found in the simulation. If instead of taking\nthe value of \u03b3 measured in the simulation, we assume\nN (L) \u221d L\u22122 , thus L\u22122 dL = M \u2212\u03b2 dM which leads to\nM \u221d L\u03b3 , \u03b3 = 1/(\u03b2 \u2212 1). With this value of \u03b3, we have\n\u2212(\u2212\u03b2 + 1/\u03b3 + 1 \u2212 \u03b7)/\u03b7 = 1 which is exactly the value inferred by Heiles & Troland (2005). Interestingly, the result\nappears to be independent of \u03b2 and \u03b7.\nLet us stress that the result, N (N ) \u221d N \u2212\u03b1 , with\n\u03b1 \u2243 1 \u2212 1.2, is largely a consequence of N (L) \u221d L\u22122\nand of the fact that the column density across a structure\nis nearly proportional to its size, which is due to the thermally bistable nature of the flow, since in that case, the\ndensity is determined almost entirely by the mean pressure and does not depend on scale or mass. Future works,\nusing larger simulations, may clarify to which extent such\nflow follows N (L) \u221d L\u22122 .\n\n4.2.3. The 3D case\nSince the simulation and the theoretical derivation are\nbidimensional, it is worth investigating the value of the\nexponent of the column density distribution in the 3D\ncase. The theory developed in paper II for the structure\nmass spectrum, N (M ), predicts that N (M ) \u221d M \u2212\u03b2 with\n\u03b2 \u2243 16/9. Assuming scale invariance, we get N (L) \u221d\n1/L3 , which leads to: L\u22123 dL = M \u2212\u03b2 dM and thus to\nM \u221d L\u03b3 , with \u03b3 = 2/(\u03b2 \u2212 1). We again make the assumption that < N >\u221d M \u03b7 . For a spheroidal cloud with\nuniform density, we have obviously \u03b7 = 1/3. In 3D, we\nhave N (N )dN = N (M ) \u00d7 L2 \u00d7 dM . Thus we obtain\nN (N ) \u2243 N (\u2212\u03b2+2/\u03b3+1\u2212\u03b7)/\u03b7 = N \u22121 , which is again the\nvalue inferred by Heiles & Troland (2005) (as in the 2D\ncase, it does not depend on \u03b2 or on \u03b7).\nNote that for \u03b2 = 1.8, we get \u03b3 = 2/0.8 = 2.5, implying\nM \u221d L2.5 . This is very similar for the mass-size relation\ninferred by Larson (1981) for the molecular clouds. Even\nmore interesting is the comparison with the results obtained by Heithausen et al. (1998) for CO clumps of mass\nranging from 104 solar mass down to Jupiter mass. For\nthese clouds, they measure M \u221d L2.3 , N (M ) \u221d M \u22121.8\nand N (L) \u221d L\u22123 . This is consistent with what we infer\nfor the CNM clouds.\n\n4.3. Group of structures properties\nThe aim of this section is to further characterize the structure of the flow and in particular the fact that the CNM\n\nFig. 16. Measure of the internal velocity dispersion of\nstructures extracted from numerical data obtained with\ndifferent smoothing and clipping threshold.\n\nstructures appear to be highly correlated and not randomly distributed.\n\n4.3.1. Methods\nIn order to achieve this, we smooth the density field by\nconvolving it with Gaussian of various widths at half maximum, b. This has the advantage of mimicking observations\ndone with a telescope having a gaussian lobe and a spatial resolution equal to b \u00d7 dx, where dx is the size of\none of our cells. For b = 40, this leads to a resolution of\nabout 0.08 pc. At 100 pc of distance, this corresponds to\na resolution of 3 arc minutes which is comparable to the\nresolution of the Arecibo telescope. Figure 15 shows the\ndensity field displayed in Fig. 1 of paper II which has been\nconvolved by a Gaussian of width at half maximum equal\nto b = 40 cells. As expected, the field displayed in Fig. 15\nis more uniform than the field displayed in Fig. 1 of paper\nII, although significant large scale fluctuations persist. As\nin paper II, we identify the structures by applying a simple clipping algorithm, i.e. the structures are defined as\ngroups of connex cells denser than a density threshold \u03c10 .\nTwo values of \u03c10 are considered in the following, namely\n5 and 30 cm\u22123 .\nWe stress that the analysis presented in this section,\nought to characterize an ensemble of individual, disconnected from each other, CNM structures which are spatially correlated and would be seen with a telescope of\ninsufficient spatial resolution as a coherent cloud.\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\n13\n\nFig. 15. Smoothed density field. The original density field has been convolved with a Gaussian having a width at half\nmaximum equal to b = 40 cells leading to a spatial resolution of about 0.1 pc.\n\n4.3.2. Velocity dispersion\nThe cloud velocity dispersion is an interesting parameter for the understanding and the characterization of the\nturbulence which takes place within the atomic medium.\nBefore we pursue, we would like to stress that the use of\nthe word turbulence in referring to the gas motions should\nbe made with some care. Indeed, the structure of the flow\nstudied here is very different from the incompressible fluids which have been extensively studied and which constitute our basic conception of the turbulent processes. As\ndiscussed above, the turbulence is produced by individual\ncloudlets motion rather than by eddies in a nearly homogeneous medium. In particular, the coupling between the\nvarious spatial scales is presumably strongly modified by\nthe stiff density fronts.\nThe cloud velocity dispersion is defined as stated by\nEq. 2, where v0 is the mean cloud velocity and where all\n\ncells having a density above the threshold and lying in\nthe area defined by the smoothed density field have been\ncounted (we stress that we use unsmoothed data to compute the velocity dispersion). Figure 16 shows results for\nb = 0 and 40 and clipping thresholds 5 and 30 cm\u22123 .\nIn the case with no smoothing, we find that most of the\nstructures have a velocity dispersion lower than 1 km/s\nmeaning that most of structures have a subsonic velocity\n\u221a dispersion. By performing a simple linear fit, we infer:\n\u03b4v 2 \u2243 7 km/s \u00d7(r/1pc)0.8 . Note that the size of structures found with no smoothing is generally smaller\n\u221a than\n0.1 pc so that this relation is valid only up to \u03b4v 2 <\n\u223c1\nkm/s.\nWith b = 40, the structures are bigger and the velocity dispersion higher. As can be seen, it is not strongly\naffected by the clipping threshold (factor \u22432). Typical\nvelocity dispersions are now around 1 km/s\u221aand up to\n3 km/s for the biggest structures. We infer \u03b4v 2 \u2243 1.4\n\n\f14\n\nHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\nvarious b and clipping thresholds. As expected, the value of\nthe filling factor presents a significant scatter and depends\non b, the width at half maximum of the Gaussian used to\ncompute the smoothing. Typical values range nevertheless\nbetween 0.8 and 0.2 whereas the average value is about\n\u2243 0.5.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nFig. 17. Measure of the cloud filling factor in structures\nextracted from numerical data obtained with different\nsmoothing and clipping threshold.\n\nkm/s\u221a\u00d7(r/1pc)0.34 for a clipping threshold of 30 cm\u22123\nand \u03b4v 2 \u2243 2.2 km/s \u00d7(r/1pc)0.4 for a clipping threshold of 5 cm\u22123 . We note that these values are reminiscent of\nthe values observed in HI clouds by Crovisier et al. (1981)\nand Heiles & Troland (2003, 2005), although Figure 12\nof Heiles & Troland (2003) suggests that the mean value\nof the Mach number inside structures is about 3. In our\ncase, it is slightly lower, 1.5-2.5, depending on the threshold which is used to define the structures. At this stage,\nit seems difficult to do a more quantitative comparison\nsince the present simulations are only 2D. In particular,\nthe approach used in this section, excludes any projection\neffect along the line of sight.\nThe fact that the internal velocity dispersion of CNM\nstructures is low (< 1 km/s) but that the velocity dispersion of the groups of structures is comparable to observations, suggests that the turbulence inside CNM clouds is\nlargely due to individual long-living cloudlet motions.\nAgain, we note that the velocity dispersion-size relation is reminiscent of what is observed in the case of molecular clouds (Larson 1981).\n\n4.3.3. Filling factor\nOne of the striking aspects of the structures displayed in\nFig. 1 and 2 of paper II is that the CNM appears to be very\nfragmented even in the densest parts of the flow. In order\nto quantify this effect, we have computed the filling factor\nof the structures extracted from the smoothed data. This\nis obtained by simply computing within these structures,\nthe filling factor of the gas (taken from unsmoothed data)\nhaving a density above the clipping threshold. The result\nis displayed in Fig. 17 which shows the filling factor for\n\nIn a companion paper, high resolution numerical simulations of the turbulent interstellar atomic hydrogen have\nbeen presented. Because of the high spatial resolution\n(0.002 pc) reached in these simulations, scales approaching the size of the smallest structures observed in HI can\nbe described.\nIn this paper we have further analyzed these numerical data in order to make preliminary comparisons with\nHI observations. We provide statistical informations on\ncolumn density, average velocity and velocity fluctuations\nalong the line of sight and, when possible, we compare\nwith the results of the Millennium Arecibo 21 centimeter absorption line carried out by Heiles & Troland (2003,\n2005).\nWe compute HI 21cm line spectra in emission and in\nabsorption along eight lines of sight. We reach the conclusion that although these spectra are relatively smoothed\nthe lines of sight from which they are calculated appear\nto be highly complex and fragmented. In particular, the\n\"turbulence\" is produced by the individual motions of\nfew long living CNM structures rather than by motions\nwithin nearly homogeneous or isothermal medium. This\nsuggests that the Mach number deduced from observation\nis more indicative of the velocity dispersion from cloud to\ncloud rather than of the internal velocity dispersion of the\nclouds. We also consider the influence of a Gaussian lobe\non the HI spectra and find that, it has in some cases, a\ndrastic influence.\nTo further characterize the CNM structures produced\nin the simulation, we have studied some of their properties, namely mass-size relation and shape. In an attempt\nto describe the high level of spatial correlations between\nthe CNM structures and to mimic observations done with\na limited spatial resolution, we have smoothed the data\nsimulations by convolving them with a Gaussian function of various sizes at half maximum and analyzed the\nresults. By doing this, it is possible to identify groups\nof structures that would be seen as a single object and\nstudy their properties like filling factor and velocity dispersion. We find the mass-size relation, in the bidimensional simulation, M \u221d L\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2243 1.7 and based on\nthe assumption N (L) \u221d L\u22123 , we speculate that in 3D,\nwe may have M \u221d L2.5 . We also find that the velocity\ndispersion increases with the size of the structures, L, as\n\u221a\n< \u03b4v 2 > \u221d L0.4 . These behaviour are reminiscent of the\nLarson laws's (Larson 1981, Heithausen et al. 1998) inferred for the molecular clouds. Moreover, since the mass\nspectrum that we obtain for the CNM structures in paper II, turns out to be compatible with the mass spec-\n\n\fHennebelle P., Audit E. and Miville-Desch\u00eanes M.-A.: Comparing simulations and observations of HI\n\ntrum observed for the molecular clouds (Kramer et al.\n1998, Heithausen et al. 1998), this suggests that (or at\nleast is compatible with it), the origin of the molecular\nclouds, is determined at a very early stage in the diffuse\natomic medium. This is also consistent with the proposition made by Falgarone & Puget (1986) and recently\nreinvestigated by Hennebelle & Inutsuka (2006) of molecular clouds being 2-phase objects. Note that it may be at\nfirst surprising to propose a theory for the origin of molecular clouds which does not include self-gravity. However,\nas revealed by CO observations (e.g. Bertoldi & McKee\n1992, Heyer et al. 2001), molecular clouds of mass smaller\nthan 103 solar mass, are not gravitationally bound making very hard to invoke gravity as an important physical\nagent for the formation of these clouds. Heyer et al. (2001)\nalso speculate that an external pressure in needed to confine them. External pressure is naturally provided by the\n2-phase physics.\nFinally, we have investigated the distribution of the\ncloud column density, N (N ). We find that between N \u2243\n2 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 and N \u2243 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , N (N ) \u221d N \u22121.2\nwhereas from their survey, Heiles & Troland (2005) inferred N (N ) \u221d N \u22121 for N \u2243 2 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 and N \u2243\n2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . We speculate that the discrepancy in the\nrange of column density is due to the setup of the numerical simulation which limits the highest column densities.\nWe also propose that the index of the power law is due\nto the flow being nearly scale-invariant, i.e. N (L) \u221d L\u2212D\n(D being the dimension), and the CNM structures being\nroughly uniform in density. Whereas the first is likely to be\na consequence of turbulence, the second is a consequence\nof the flow being thermally bistable, that is to say the density of the CNM does not change with scale or structure\nmass.\nAcknowledgements.
