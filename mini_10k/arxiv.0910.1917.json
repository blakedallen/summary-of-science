Due to lack of full\ndiffeomorphism, some extra graviton modes are expected generally but there have been\nconfusions regarding the extra modes and the consistency of the Ho\u0159ava model [3\u201315]. Especially, regarding the \u03bb = 1 case in which general relativity is expected to be recovered in\nIR limit, there have been subtleties in defining physical modes [1, 2, 4].\nIn this paper, I reconsider those problems and show that, in the Minkowski vacuum background, the extra scalar graviton mode can be consistently decoupled from the usual tensor\ngraviton modes, by imposing the (local) Hamiltonian constraint as well as the momentum\nconstraints. This reduces to the results of Einstein gravity in IR and achieves the consistency\nof the model.\nTo this ends, I start by considering the ADM decomposition of the metric\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nds2 = \u2212N 2 c2 dt2 + gij dxi + N i dt\nand the IR-modified Ho\u0159ava action which reads\nS =\n\nZ\n\n+\n\n\u221a\ndtd x gN\n3\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n\u0011\n\ndxj + N j dt\n\n(1)\n\n\u0011\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba2 \u03bc ijk (3)\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2 (3) (3)ij\n2 \u0010\nij\n2\nij\n(3)l\n\u2212\nK\nK\n\u2212\n\u03bbK\nC\nC\n+\n\u01eb\nR\n\u2207\nR\n\u2212\nRij R\nij\nij\nj\nk\nil\n\u03ba2\n2\u03bd 4\n2\u03bd 2\n8\n#\n!\n4\u03bb \u2212 1 (3) 2\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2 \u03c9\n(3)\n2\n(3)\n,\n(2)\n(R ) \u2212 \u039bW R + 3\u039bW +\nR\n4\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n\"\n\nwhere\nKij =\n\n1\n(\u0121ij \u2212 \u2207i Nj \u2212 \u2207j Ni )\n2N\n\n(3)\n\nis the extrinsic curvature (the dot ( \u0307) denotes the derivative with respect to t),\nij\n\nikl\n\n\u0012\n\nC = \u01eb \u2207k R\n\n(3)j\n\n1 (3) j\nl \u2212 R \u03b4l\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n(4)\n\nis the Cotton tensor, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd, \u03bc, \u039bW , and \u03c9 are constant parameters. The last term, which\nhas been introduced in [2, 4, 16, 17], represents a \"soft\" breaking of the \"detailed balance\"\ncondition in [2] and this modifies the IR behaviors such that the flat Minkowski vacuum is\nallowed 1 .\nThe action is invariant under the foliation-preserving diffeomorphism2 (Diff)\n\u03b4xi = \u2212\u03b6 i (t, x), \u03b4t = \u2212f (t),\n\u03b4gij = \u2202i \u03b6 k gjk + \u2202j \u03b6 k gik + \u03b6 k \u2202k gij + f \u0121ij ,\n\u03b4Ni = \u2202i \u03b6 j Nj + \u03b6 j \u2202j Ni + \u03b6\u0307 j gij + f \u1e44i + f \u0307Ni ,\n\u03b4N = \u03b6 j \u2202j N + f \u1e44 + f \u0307N.\n1\n\n2\n\n(5)\n\nIn [4], \u03c9 = 8\u03bc2 (3\u03bb \u2212 1)/\u03ba2 has been considered for the AdS case, but \u03c9 may be considered as an\nindependent parameter, more generally.\nThis corresponds to a flat slicing of constant-time surfaces. But more general (space-like) curved slicings\nmay be also possible in which the Diff symmetry with \u03b4t = \u2212f (t, x) can be achieved, at least \"formally\",\nwith the corresponding covariant-like actions. (See, for example, [18]).\n\n2\n\n\fNote that this Diff exists for arbitrary spacetime-dependent N, Ni , gij . This implies that the\nequations of motion by varying N, Ni , gij are all the \"local\" equations as in the usual Lorentz\ninvariant Einstein gravity. If we restrict N to be a function of t only (known as \"projectable\"\nfunction [1, 2, 8]), it does not transform to any gauge choice for which N is a function of\nspace also. So, it seems that there are two gauge inequivalent classes for Ho\u0159ava gravity,\ni.e., projectable and non-projectable versions. However, since obtaining general relativity,\nincluding the Newtonian gravity for generic gauges, in IR limit could be problematic in the\nprojectable version and also the choice of N = N(t) can be achieved only for some limited\nregions or classes of spacetimes [8, 19, 20], we only consider the non-projetable version in\nthis paper. 3\nNow, in order to study graviton modes, I will consider perturbations of metric around\nsome appropriate backgrounds, which are solutions of the full theory (2). But, from the\nlimited knowledge of the exact (stationary) background solutions4 , I consider only the perturbations around Minkowski vacuum5 , which is a solution of the full theory (2) in the limit\nof \u039bW \u2192 0,\ngij = \u03b4ij + \u01ebhij , N = 1 + \u01ebn, Ni = \u01ebni\n\n(6)\n\nwith a small expansion parameter \u01eb.\nFrom the extrinsic curvatures under the perturbations (6),\n\u0011\n\u01eb\u0010\n\u1e23ij \u2212 \u2202i nj \u2212 \u2202j ni + O(\u01eb2 ),\n2\u0010\n\u0011\n\u01eb\nK =\n(7)\n\u1e23 \u2212 2\u2202i ni + O(\u01eb2 )\n2\nR\n\u221a\nwith h \u2261 \u03b4 ij hij , the kinetic part SK = dtd3 x gN \u03ba22 (Kij K ij \u2212 \u03bbK 2 ) becomes, at the\nquadratic order,\n\nKij =\n\nSK =\n\nZ\n\ndtd3 x\n\n\u0011\n\u01eb2 \u0010\nij\n2\ni\n\u1e23\n\u1e23\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u1e23\n\u2212\nn\nH\nij\ni (\u01eb) ,\n2\u03ba2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\ni\n\u0011\n\u01eb i\n2\u01eb h \u0010 ij\nij\ni\nj\n2 i\n\u22480\n\u2202\n\u2202\nh\n\u2212\n\u03bb\u03b4\n\u2202\nh\n+\n(2\u03bb\n\u2212\n1)\u2202\n\u2202\nn\n\u2212\n\u2202\nn\nH\n\u2261\n\u2212\nt\nj\nj\nj\n(\u01eb)\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba2\n\n(9)\n\nare the momentum constraints at the linear order of \u01eb.\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nIn (non-projectable) Ho\u0159ava gravity, the local Hamiltonian constraint does not form a closed, i.e., firstclass constraint, algebra. However this does not mean that (local) Hamiltonian constraint can not be\nimposed consistently but only means that we have more (secondary) constraints. There have been some\nanalyses about the additional constraints in the literatures [7, 12] but the full set of the constraints seems\nto be still unraveled and deserves fuller investigation.\nFor an arbitrary \u039bW , there is analog of the standard Schwarzschild-(A)dS solution when considering\n\u03bb = 1 [4, 16], but for an arbitrary \u03bb the corresponding solution is not known yet. In contrast, for (nonstationary) FRW-type cosmology solution, the vacuum solution for an arbitrary \u03bb does exist but this can\nnot transform to the stationary form due to the absence of the full Diff.\nThe Minkowski vacuum satisfies trivially the secondary constraint which is generated by the consistency\nof the local Hamiltonian constraint [7, 12].\n\n3\n\n\fOn the other hand, the Diff (5) reduces to (see [4, 8] for comparisons)\n\u03b4xi = \u2212\u01eb\u03be i (t, x), \u03b4t = \u2212\u01ebg(t),\n\u03b4hij = \u2202i \u03bej + \u2202j \u03bei ,\n\u03b4ni = \u03be \u0307i , \u03b4n = \u0121.\n\n(10)\n\nHere, one can choose, by taking time-independent spatial Diff, \u03be i = \u03be i (x),\nni = 0\n\n(11)\n\nbut this does not mean the absence of the momentum constraints \u01ebH\u01ebi \u2248 0 again, as in the\nA0 = 0 gauge in the gauge theory: A0 is the Lagrange multiplier like as N, Ni and its\nvariation gives the (local) Gauss' law constraint, but the gauge choice A0 = 0 does not mean\nthat there is no local Gauss' law constraint [21]; indeed, the local Gauss' law is needed in\norder to be consistent with the existence of gauge symmetry for \u03b4Ai = \u2202i \u03b8 independently of\nthe gauge choice A0 and moreover, the absence of the Gauss' law constraint leads to troubles\nin quantization. In this case, one can choose the Ho\u0159ava's gauge [1, 2] for the perturbed\nmetric hij ,\n\u2202j hij \u2212 \u03bb\u03b4 ij \u2202j h = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is time independent, according to the momentum constraints (9).

This is basically due to the fact that the\nmomentum and Hamiltonian constraints (9) and (19), \"degenerate\" for the Ho\u0159ava's gauge\n(12) with \u03bb = 1, at the linear order of \u01eb. In other words, for \u03bb = 1 the gauge fixing condition\n(12) is consistent only if the (local) Hamiltonian constraint (19) is considered; with the\nHamiltonian constraint (19), the gauge condition (12) can be consistent for arbitrary values\nof \u03bb, including \u03bb = 1. Actually, this has been a source of some confusions and troubles\nin the literatures.\nFor example, in the projectable version [1, 2, 8], the global Hamiltonian\nR 3\nt\nconstraint d xH \u2248 0 has been considered together with the momentum constraint (9),\nbut in this case, there has been a problem in defining the gauge condition (12) for \u03bb = 1:\n7\n\nt\nIf one considers the last term in (18), \u2212nH(\u01eb)\n, as hik \u2202k \u2202i n \u2212 h\u2202 2 n, by taking the integration by parts,\nand solves the equations of motions for hij first, a lot of troubles occur. Actually, this is the source of\nthe troubles in [12]. However, by considering the time-independent temporal Diff, i.e., g = constant, one\ncan always choose the gauge, called synchronous or (gravitational) Weyl gauge together with (11), n = 0\nalso and the troublesome terms disappear; this implies that the strong coupling problem which has been\nobserved in [12] would be a gauge artifact. This result agrees with the perturbations in FRW background\n[11].\n\n5\n\n\fApplying \u2202i to (12), the left hand side equals to the linearized Ricci scalar R(3) in (17)\nwhich\ncan not set to zero by gauge transformation with the global Hamiltonian constraint\nR 3\nd xR(3) \u2248 0, generally 8 .\nFrom the mode decomposition, the second-order spatial derivative action (21) becomes\nSV (2)\n\n\u01eb2 \u03ba2 \u03bc2 \u03c9\n=\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 + 3\u03bb)\n1\nt\ndtd x H\u0303ij \u2202 2 H\u0303 ij \u2212\nH\u2202 2 H + nH(\u01eb)\n4\n8(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)2\n3\n\n#\n\n(24)\n\nwith\nt\nH(\u01eb)\n=\n\n1\u2212\u03bb 2\n\u2202 H \u2248 0.\n(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)\n\n(25)\n\nThen the second-order derivative action becomes altogether\nS(2)\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2 \u03c9\n1  \u0307  \u0307 ij\nH\u0303 ij H\u0303 +\nH\u0303ij \u2202 2 H\u0303 ij\ndtd x\n= \u01eb\n2\n2\u03ba\n32(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n#\n2 2\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\u03ba \u03bc \u03c9(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 + 3\u03bb)\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2 \u03c9\n2\n2\nt\n+\n\u1e22 +\nH\u2202 H +\nnH(\u01eb) .\n4(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)\u03ba2\n64(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)3\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n2\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\"\n\n(26)\n\nThe first two terms represent the usual transverse traceless graviton modes H\u0303ij with the\nspeed of gravitational interaction\ncg =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n\u03ba4 \u03bc2 \u03c9\n,\n16(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n(27)\n\nwhich agrees with the speed of light c in the IR and \u039bW \u2192 0 limits of the action (2) [4, 17]:\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nc4\n\u221a\n(28)\ndtd3 x gN 2 Kij K ij \u2212 \u03bbK 2 + R(3) .\nS\u03bbEH =\n16\u03c0G\nc\nHere it is important to note that the propagation can exist due to the IR modification term\nwith an arbitrary coefficient \u03c9, which has been overlooked in [1, 2] but corrected in [4].\nThe next two terms seem to imply another scalar mode H but this depends on the values\nof \u03bb: For \u03bb 6= 1, this mode is physical but non-propagating in the physical subspace of\nthe Hamiltonian constraint (25), giving \u2202 2 H \u2248 0. On the other hand, for \u03bb = 1, where\nthe Hamiltonian constraint is trivially satisfied due to the degeneracy with the momentum\nconstraints, the mode H is completely disappeared in the action and this agrees with the\nusual Einstein gravity. Actually, this can be more easily understood in the decomposition\n(15) in which the second term is absent for \u03bb = 1 and then the remaining term of H can be\ngauged away due to the symmetry (10). 9 This provides a consistency of the Ho\u0159ava gravity\nin the IR limit.\nZ\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nR\nThe global constraint d3 xHt \u2248 0 in [1, 2, 8] produces the equations for spatial infinity, in the absence\nof the inner boundary, due to the total derivative form of (19) at the linear order of \u01eb. But this can be\nnegligible for the fields hij which decay fast enough at infinity.\nIn some literatures [1\u20133, 8], it was claimed that the equation of motion of the scalar mode for \u03bb = 1 reduces\nto \u1e26 = 0, giving the linearly expanding solution H(t, x) = H0 (x) + tH1 (x), but this undesirable mode can\nbe eliminated by the extra gauge invariance for \u03bb = 1 such that the usual general relativity is recovered\nin IR. However, this argument is quite subtle since the correct equation of motion is (\u03bb \u2212 1)\u1e26 = 0, which\nis trivially satisfied for arbitrary solution of H(t, x) which can go beyond the extra gauge transformation.\n\n6\n\n\fThe UV behaviors are governed by the higher derivative terms in (2) and the quadratic\npart of the perturbed action is\nS(U V )\n\n\u01eb2\n=\n4\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ndtd3 x \u2212\u0101H\u0303ij \u2202 6 H\u0303 ij + b\u0304\u01ebijk H\u0303il \u2202 4 \u2202j H\u0303kl + c\u0304H\u0303ij \u2202 4 H\u0303 ij\n(\u03bb \u2212 1)2\n+\n(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)2\n\n\u0012\n\n#\n\n3c\u0304\n+ 4d \u0304 H\u2202 4 H ,\n2\n\u0013\n\n(29)\n\nwhere\n\u0101 = \u2212\n\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n\u03ba2 \u03bc2  \u0304 \u03ba2 \u03bc2 (4\u03bb \u2212 1)\n,\nb\u0304\n=\n,\nc\u0304\n=\n\u2212\n, d=\n2\u03bd 4\n2\u03bd 2\n8\n32(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n(3)\n\n(30)\n\n(3)\n\nare the coefficients of Cij C ij , \u01ebijk Ril \u2207j R(3)l k , Rij R(3)ij , and R(3) R(3) , respectively. The\nfirst three terms provide the modified dispersion relation \u03c9 2 \u223c k 6 + * * * for the transverse\ntraceless modes. Here, the (UV) detailed balance with the particular values of the coefficients\n(30) do not have any role. The last term contains higher spatial derivatives of the scalar\nmode H but this does not appear in the physical subspace of either \u03bb 6= 1, giving \u2202 2 H \u2248 0,\nor \u03bb = 1, again.

But, even in this case, these\nterms do not produce the propagation in the physical subspace, for arbitrary values of \u03bb.\nIn conclusion, I have reconsidered the problem of the extra scalar graviton mode in Ho\u0159ava\ngravity. I showed that, in the Minkowski vacuum background, the scalar mode excitation\ncan be consistently decoupled from the usual tensor graviton modes in UV as well as in\nIR, by imposing the (local) Hamiltonian constraint as well as the momentum constraints,\nregardless of \u03bb = 1 or not. This provides a consistency of the IR modified Ho\u0159ava gravity for\nthe quadratic perturbations in the Minkowski vacuum background. It would be interesting\nto study the role of the local Hamiltonian constraint in the scalar mode decoupling with\nthe more general backgrounds with matters and higher order perturbations which have been\nalso debating issues [6, 10\u201312].\nNote Added: After the appearance of this paper, there have been several analyses on the\nnumber of physical modes of Ho\u0159ava gravity through the constraints algebra. First at the\nlinear order for cosmological perturbations, it has been found [23] that there is no additional\nscalar perturbation mode, in agreement with [11] and the present paper. Later at the fully\nnon-linear orders for the IR limit of Ho\u0159ava gravity (28), it has been also found that the\nnumber of physical degrees of freedom is the same as GR, which implies that there is no\nnon-perturbative generation of scalar graviton as well, in the IR limit.
