We\nconclude that VO2 in rutile phase is strongly correlated metal with local magnetic moments formed\nby vanadium d-electrons.\nPACS numbers:\n\nTransition metal compounds and particularly vanadium oxides attract a lot of interests because of rich variety of structural modifications and properties1 . Vanadium dioxide is not an exception and is well known due\nto metal-insulator transition at 340 K2 . The value of the\nenergy gap (\u2206g =0.6 eV) in insulating phase and vicinity of the transition and room temperatures allows one\nto use this material as \"wisdom\" windows and in another termochromic applications3 . This compound has\nbeen extensively investigated experimentally and theoretically over the half of century. The phase diagram2\nin the temperature-pressure (or chemical doping) coordinates consists of the paramagnetic metal at high temperature and three insulating states below Tc . Below transition temperature there are three insulating phases, called\nM1 , T and M2 at low, intermediate and large values of\ndoping, respectively. The M1 and M2 phases crystallize\nto monoclinic structure which can be obtained from hightemperature rutile by distortion and doubling of the cell.\nIn the former structure equivalent vanadium atoms are\npaired and off-axis shifted forming zigzags while in the\nlater one there are two kinds of vanadium chains, one\nof which is paired and another one forms zigzags without pairing. In both phases the conductivity drops by\nfactor of several orders in magnitude comparing with rutile phase with the estimation of the energy gap about\n0.6 eV4 . Above the transition temperature VO2 crystallizes to rutile structure at all values of doping and can\nbe regarded as two vanadium chains along cR axis (see\nFig. 1).\nMost of earlier theoretical studies for correlation effects\nin vanadium dioxide were concentrated on the insulating\nlow-temperature phases where band structure calculations have difficulties to reproduce correct insulating type\nof electronic structure5\u20137 . Calculation for rutile crystal\nstructure resulted in metallic bands in agreement with\nexperiment, and hence, it was assumed that taking into\naccount Coulomb correlations is not needed here. However magnetic and spectral measurements for VO2 show\nthat correlation strength could be essential for metallic\nrutile phase8,9 . The magnetic experiments for metallic\n\nrutile phase show a quite large temperature dependent\nmagnetic susceptibility that indicates formation of local\nmagnetic moment in the partially filled d-band. Recent\nphotoemission data8 display the quasi-particle peak at\nthe Fermi level and high energy structure associated with\nthe lower Hubbard band about -1 eV. The effective electron mass, m\u2217 /m, extracted from optics9 is about 4.3\nwhich is larger then the value observed for Srx Ca1\u2212x VO3\ncharacterized as strongly correlated paramagnetic metals10 . Recent LDA+DMFT investigations11 of vanadium\noxide have paid an attention to the spectral properties of\nthe compound and have showed a good agreement with\nphotoemission and optical data.\nIn the present work we have used state of the art\nLDA+DMFT method12 to study the physics of VO2 in\nmetallic rutile phase with the special focus on the magnetic properties. Temperature dependence of the calculated magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) reproduces with a\ngood accuracy Curie-Weiss law \u03c7CW (T ) = p2ef f /3(T \u2212\u0398)\nand is in an agreement with experimental data. Calculations results for the spectral function are typical for\nstrongly correlated metal with well developed Hubbard\nbands in addition to quasi-particle metallic peak at Fermi\nlevel and they agree well with earlier studies11 . Calculated value of effective electron mass enhancement factor\nm\u2217 /m \u2248 2 proves a relatively large strength of correlation effects for metallic phase of VO2 . Therefore, vanadium dioxide in rutile phase is the strongly correlated\nmetal with local magnetic moments.\nAt high temperatures, vanadium dioxide crystallizes as\nrutile shown on the Fig. 1. It has the P 42 /mnm space\ngroup and details of lattice constants and atomic positions can be found in Ref. 13. Each vanadium atom is\nsurrounded by a oxygen's octahedron resulting in split\u2040 and doubly degenting of d level to triply degenerate 2g\n\u03c3\nerate eg states. Additional tetragonal distortion present\nin the structure leads to further lifting of degeneracy of\n\u20402g level to a1g and \u03c0 states (d|| and d\u03c0 according to\nGooenough's notations5 ). In the local coordinate basis\nshown on the Fig. 1 by (double) primed axes for vanadium atoms, a1g state corresponds to the dx\u2032 y\u2032 orbital,\n\n\f2\n6\nTotal\nV 3d\nO 2p\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Crystal structure of rutile phase. Vanadium and oxygen atoms are denoted by large (red) and small\n(cyan) balls. (aR , bR , cR ) are rutile crystallographic axes and\ncoincide with the Cartesian one. Local coordinate axes on the\nvanadium atoms are shown by (double) primed set.\n\n\u03c0 states correspond to dx\u2032 z\u2032 and dy\u2032 z\u2032 and e\u03c3g to dz\u20322 and\ndx\u20322 \u2212y\u20322 orbitals. The local z \u2032 axis is chosen to be pointed\nto apical oxygen atoms and local x\u2032 and y \u2032 are chosen to\nbe pointed to the planar oxygens. This local coordinate\nsystem can be obtained by the rotation to the Euler's\nangles (\u03c0/4, \u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/4). The double primed local coordinate axes are obtained by a proper symmetry operation\nfor corresponding vanadium atoms.\nWe used TB-LMTO method14 to calculate electronic\nstructure of VO2 . The results obtained are presented on\nthe Fig. 2 and have a good agreement with earlier studies7 . Total and partial (per atom) density of states are\nshown on the top panel (for details of color-coding see\ncaption). One can clearly see that the states crossing\n\u2040 symmetry mainly and\nFermi level are of vanadium 2g\nspread from -0.5 eV to 2 eV. They are well separated by\na gap of 1.4 eV from occupied bonding states of mixed\nO 2p and V e\u03c3g character. The anti-bonding combination\nis located above 2 eV and is also separated by a tiny\n\u2040 bands. The orbitally (symmetry) degap from the 2g\ncomposed partial DOSes for vanadium atom in the local\ncoordinate system mentioned above are presented on the\nbottom panel of Fig. 2. a1g state is more narrow than \u03c0\none and has a one-dimensional-like shape.\nWe constructed low-energy Hamiltonian for V \u20402g states\nusing the N MTO method15 . It has a dimension of\n6 and will be used in LDA+DMFT calculation. The\neigenvalues of the N MTO Hamiltonian coincide with the\nLMTO's one by construction in the energy interval close\nto the Fermi level and shape of the density of states remains the same (not presented). Hopping integrals for\nthe Wannier function of a1g , \u03c01 and \u03c02 (dx\u2032 y\u2032 , dx\u2032 z\u2032 and\ndy\u2032 z\u2032 in local notations) symmetries are presented in the\nTable I for the vanadium atoms in chain (along cR axis)\nand between chains (upper and lower parts of table, respectively).

Top panel shows total, V 3d and O 2p DOSes\nby (black) solid, (green) dashed and (red) dot-dashed lines,\nrespectively. Bottom panel shows partial DOSes of different\nsymmetry for vanadium atom (see legends for notations)\n\ncan easily jump to the same orbital on the nearest neighbor atom and it is the largest (intra chain) hopping. The\nprobability to hop to another chains is much smaller for\na1g electron. Overall structure of a1g hoppings assumes\none-dimensional-like physics where the largest transfer\nintegral defines energy splitting between peaks and the\nrest is responsible for asymmetry of density of states and\nits broadening (see a1g partial DOS on the bottom panel\nof Fig. 2). The structure of the \u03c0 hoppings is more\nuniform in space that produces more three dimensional\nshape of density of states.\nTo take into account electron-electron correlation\nin the partially filled d-band we use LDA+DMFT\nmethod12 . It combines the material specific aspect in\nLDA and accurate treatment of local Coulomb intraction in DMFT16,17 . The later is achieved via mapping\nof the lattice problem with many degrees of freedom\nto the quantum impurity embedded to the time dependent self-consistent bath (for details about LDA+DMFT\nmethod and implementations see e.g. Refs 18). For the\nsolution of the quantum impurity problem the modern\nmulti-orbital Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte-Carlo method\nhas been used19 . In our LDA+DMFT calculations we use\nthe value of screened Coulomb interaction, U =4 eV, and\nthe value of Hund's exchange, J=0.68 eV.

Following the linear response\nidea, the uniform magnetic susceptibility can be calculated directly by adding to the Hamiltonian an external\nmagnetic field, \u03bcB Hz , and measuring magnetization of\ncompound. Then, the uniform magnetic susceptibility is\n\u03c7(T ) =\n\nm(T )\n,\nHz\n\n(1)\n\np2ef f\n3(T \u2212 \u0398)\n\n(2)\n\nP\n\u2191\n\u2193\nwhere m(T ) =\nm nm \u2212 nm is a magnetization at\ngiven temperature. The few magnetic fields of order\n\u223c 0.02 \u00f7 0.1 eV were used to check and satisfy the condition of linearity of magnetization. The inverse of calculated uniform magnetic susceptibility and experimental\ndata extracted from Ref. 20 are shown on the Fig. 3. One\ncan clearly see that these inverse quantities agree accurately to the shift along ordinate axis. This implies that\nthe calculated and experimental effective magnetic moments are in good agreement. The theoretical estimate\nobtained by the fit to the Curie-Weiss law\n\u03c7CW (T ) =\n\ngives the value of the effective magnetic moment, ptheor\nef f =\n1.54\u03bcB , in a good agreement with the experimental value\n4+\npexp\nion with\nef f = 1.53\u03bcB that is close to ideal value for V\nthe spin S = 1/2, pef f = 1.73\u03bcB . To make the fit shown\nby lines we have used the data points above 500 K where\nthe linearity of \u03c7\u22121 is more pronounced for theoretical\nand experimental data as well. The use of complete data\nset leads to the slightly higher values of magnetic moments21 . The theoretical Curie-Weiss temperature \u0398 is\nalmost twice larger then its experimental counterpart (1600 K and -700 K correspondingly), that is connected\nto the mean-field nature of the calculations and, hence,\nabsence of the collective excitations.\nWe have also calculated a local spin-spin correlation\nfunction, hSz (\u03c4 )Sz (0)i at different temperatures shown\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Inverse of uniform magnetic susceptibility. LDA+DMFT results are shown by (black) squares,\nthe experimental data by Zylbersztejn et al.20 are (red) circles. Lines are result of linear fit of data above 500 K.\n\non the Fig. 4. Albeit this is a pure local quantity and\ncannot be directly compared to the experimental data, it\ngives a sound source of information about magnetic properties of the system. At low temperatures, in the Fermi\nliquid regime, the local spin-spin correlation function behaves as [T /sin(\u03c0\u03c4 T )]2 at intermediate times, \u03c4 , while it\nsaturates to the constant value for the insulator or metal\nwith a very well developed local magnetic moment17,22 .\nAt middle point, the correlator is hSz (\u03b2/2)Sz (0)i \u2248 T \u03b1 ,\nwith exponent \u03b1=2 for Fermi liquid and zero for the insulator. On the upper panel of the Fig. 4, from the time dependency one can see that the correlation function is not\nsaturated. At the same time, the hSz (\u03b2/2)Sz (0)i quantity plotted in the inset of upper panel shows the linear\nbehavior with the exponent \u03b1=1 different from both insulating and metallic regimes. This observation suggests\nthat the formation of the local magnetic moment in the\nmetallic phase is not completely finished22 . The lower\npanel of the Fig. 4 shows the analytical continuation of\nthe local spin-spin correlation function to the real energy\naxis23 . The width of the peak at zero frequency is inverse\nproportional to a \"lifetime\" of the local magnetic moment\nand it is much larger than that of the \u03b1-iron in paramagnetic phase24 which is closer to the localized limit.\nThe inset in the lower panel shows the inverse of the loR\u03b2\ncal magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7loc (T ) = 0 d\u03c4 hSz (\u03c4 )Sz (0)i\nversus temperature. This quantity has a noticeable linear behavior and by fitting it to the Curie law one obtains the value of the effective local magnetic moment,\nploc = 1.54\u03bcB and critical temperature. The comparison\nof the local and uniform susceptibilities gives a rough\nestimation of the degree of spacial correlations. The\nclose values of the extracted effective magnetic moments,\nptheor\nand ploc , assumes that the vanadium dioxide at\nef f\nhigh temperatures has a localized type of magnetism.\nNow, we would like to turn our discussion to single particle properties. The imaginary part of the self-energy for\na1g and \u03c0 orbitals are shown on the Fig. 5.

The lower inset shows\nthe extracted to zero imaginary part of self-energy, I\u03a3(0)\nversus temperature. One can see that it goes quadratically to zero at low temperatures once again confirming\nFermi-liquid nature of compound. From these data one\ncan conclude that the coherence temperature is about\n700 K for both orbitals.\nThe comparison of the photoemission data8 (PES)\nwith the calculated LDA and LDA+DMFT results are\npresented on the upper panel of the Fig. 6. One can\nclearly observe a good agreement of the LDA+DMFT\n(color lines) and PES data (dots). There is a quasiparticle peak at the Fermi level and lower Hubbard band\nat higher energies. The later is an additional evidence of\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Imaginary part of self-energy for a1g\n(top) and eg (bottom) states in metallic phase.

Upper inset\nshows the effective mass, m\u2217 /m, for a1g and eg orbitals by\n(black) circles and (dark green) squares, respectively. Lower\ninsets shows the imaginary part of self-energy extracted to\nzero energy, I\u03a3(0). Color-coding is the same as in previous\ninset.\n\nthe correlated nature of the metallic rutile phase. Temperature dependence of the LDA+DMFT spectra shown\nby different colors is also in good qualitative agreement\nwith the experiment (see Fig. 3 of the Ref. 8): the\nspectral weight is transferred from quasi-particle peak\nto higher energies and becomes smaller with decrease of\ntemperature. At the same time, the LDA results shown\nby the dashed line describe the quasi-particle feature at\nthe Fermi level with a large overestimation of the peak\nweight and complete absence of the high energy incoherent hump. LDA+DMFT spectral function for lowest\ncalculated temperature, T \u2248 390 K is presented on the\nlower panel of the Fig. 6. One can clearly see the three\npeaks structure which is typical for correlated materials. The quasi-particle peak lies at/above the Fermi level\nand low and upper Hubbard bands are located at higher\nfrequencies, at -1.5 eV and \u223c2.3 eV. The width of the\nquasi-particle peak is reduced to \u223c1.1 eV comparing with\n2.1 eV value for non-interacting band width and is almost\nindependent with temperature which is compatible with\nthe weak temperature dependence of the quasi-particle\nweight, Z = m/m\u2217 , for both orbitals (see upper inset of\n\n\f5\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nFig. 5). One should note here that the spectral functions\nfor higher temperatures are similar to described above.\nThe difference is that the shape of the quasi-particle peak\nbecomes more complicated due to the decrease (in absolute value) of the imaginary part of self-energy at zero\nenergy (see lower inset of the Fig. 5), and hence, displaying the features of original LDA spectral function\nsmoothed by high temperature at \u03b2=10 eV\u22121 .\n\nExp. data\nLDA\n\u03b2 = 30\n\nIn conclusion we have studied the influence of Coulomb\ncorrelation effects on magnetic and spectral properties of\nVO2 in metallic rutile phase by LDA+DMFT method.\nThe calculation results show typical strongly correlated\nmetal behavior for self-energy with a sizable spectral\nweight transfer to Hubbard bands and electronic states\nrenormalization near the Fermi level with effective mass\nm\u2217 /m \u2248 2. The uniform and local magnetic susceptibility calculation obey Curie-Weiss temperature dependence with effective magnetic moment value close to ideal\nionic value corresponding to d1 configuration. A good\nagreement of calculated and measured spectral and magnetic properties allows to conclude that VO2 in rutile\nphase is in strongly correlated metal state with local magnetic moments formed by d-electrons.\n\n\u03b2 = 15\n\u03b2 = 10\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nEnergy (eV)\nDOS (states/eV)\n\n4\n\nTotal\na1g\neg\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nEnergy (eV)\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Top panel shows comparison of the\nphotoemission data extracted from the Ref. 8 and calculated\nLDA and LDA+DMFT results for various temperatures.
