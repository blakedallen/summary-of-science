Bahcall\n\nHow does the Sun shine? How well do we understand the evolution and ages of\nstars? Does the neutrino have a mass? Can a neutrino change its lepton number\nin flight? Are there weak interactions beyond those described by the standard\nmodel of particle physics? These are some of the questions that motivate the\nstudy of solar neutrinos.\nA neutrino is a weakly interacting particle that travels at essentially the speed\nof light and has an intrinsic angular momentum of 21 unit (~/2). Neutrinos are\nproduced on Earth by natural radioactivity, by nuclear reactors, and by highenergy accelerators. In the Sun, neutrinos are produced by weak interactions\nthat occur during nuclear fusion. There are three known types of neutrinos,\neach associated with a massive lepton that experiences weak, electromagnetic,\nand gravitational forces, but not strong interactions. The known leptons are\nelectrons, muons, and taus (in increasing order of their rest masses).\nNeutrino astronomy is difficult for the same reason it is interesting. Because\nneutrinos only interact weakly with matter, they can reach us from otherwise\ninaccessible regions where photons, the traditional messengers of astronomy, are\ntrapped. Hence, with neutrinos we can look inside stars and examine directly\nenergetic physical processes that occur only in stellar interiors. We can study\nthe interior of the Sun or the core of a collapsing star as it produces a supernova.\nLarge detectors, typically hundreds or thousands of tons of material, are\nrequired to observe astronomical neutrinos. These detectors must be placed\ndeep underground to avoid confusing the rare astronomical neutrino events with\nthe background interactions caused by cosmic rays and their secondary particles,\nwhich are relatively common near the surface of the Earth.\nThe nearest star, our Sun, supplies the largest known flux of neutrinos at the\nEarth's surface. Every second approximately a hundred billion solar neutrinos\ncross every square centimeter on Earth. Quite naturally, the first attempt to\ndetect astronomical neutrinos began with an experiment to observe neutrinos\nproduced in the deep interior of the Sun.\nFor two decades, from 1968 to 1988, the only operating solar neutrino experiment (carried out by Raymond Davis Jr. and his colleagues and using 37 Cl as\na detector) yielded results in conflict with the most accurate theoretical calculations of how many neutrinos are produced in the Sun. This conflict between\ntheory and observation became known as the 'solar neutrino problem.'\nBoth the theoretical and the observational results for the chlorine experiment\nare expressed in terms of the solar neutrino unit, SNU, which is the product of a\ncharacteristic calculated solar neutrino flux (units: cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) times a theoretical\ncross section for neutrino absorption (unit: cm2 ). A SNU has, therefore, the\nunits of events per target atom per second and is chosen for convenience equal\nto 10\u221236 s\u22121 .\nAfter two decades of critical examination of both the theory and the experiment, both results were determined robustly. The predicted rate for capturing\n\n\f2\nsolar neutrinos in a\n\n37\n\nCl target is (Bahcall and Ulrich, 1988; Bahcall, 1989)\nPredicted rate = (7.9 \u00b1 0.9) SNU .\n\n(1)\n\nThe rate observed by R. Davis, Jr. (1986) and his associates in their chlorine\nradiochemical detector is\nObserved rate = (2.1 \u00b1 0.3) SNU .\n\n(2)\n\nBoth the theoretical and the experimental uncertainties are quoted as 1\u03c3 errors.\nThe predictions used in Eqs. (1) and (2) are valid for the combined standard\nmodel, that is, the standard model of electroweak theory (of Glashow, Weinberg,\nand Salam) and the standard solar model.\nSimilar results to those shown in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) were obtained in 1968.\nThe most recent theoretical result is 8.5 \u00b1 1.8 SNU (Bahcall and Pinsonneault\n2004) and the final experiment value is 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 SNU (Cleveland, Daily, Davis,\net al. 1998). The robustness of the discrepancy between theory and observation\nstimulated the development two generations of increasingly more powerful and\nsophisticated detectors designed to find the reason why theory and observation\ndiffer.\nMore is known about the Sun than about any other star and the calculations\nof neutrino emission from the solar interior can be done with relatively high\nprecision. Solar neutrino experiments test in a direct and rigorous way the\ntheories of nuclear energy generation in stellar interiors and of stellar evolution.\nThese tests are independent of many of the uncertainties that complicate the\ncomparison of the theory with observations of stellar surfaces. For example,\nconvection and turbulence are important near stellar surfaces but unimportant\nin the solar interior. Hence, the solar neutrino discrepancy puzzled (and worried)\nastronomers who want to use neutrino observations to understand better how\nthe Sun and other stars shine. Prior to June 2001 (see discussion of SNO\nexperiment below), the solar neutrino problem seemed to most (but not all)\nphysicists to indicate that astronomers did not understand the details of the\nsolar nuclear fusion reactions that produce neutrinos.\nNeutrinos from the Sun provide particle beams for probing the weak interactions on distance scales that cannot be achieved with traditional laboratory\nexperiments. Since neutrinos from the Sun travel astronomical distances before\nthey reach the Earth, experiments performed with these particle beams are sensitive to weak-interaction phenomena that require long path lengths in order\nfor slow weak-interaction effects to have time to occur. The effects of tiny neutrino masses (\u2265 10\u22126 eV), unmeasurable in the laboratory, can be studied with\nsolar neutrinos. Moreover, neutrinos traverse an enormous amount of matter,\n1011 gm cm\u22122 , as they travel from the center of the Sun to detectors on Earth.\nThe huge column density of matter that solar neutrinos traverse can give rise to\n'matter effects' on neutrino propagation that have not yet been observed with\nterrestrial neutrinos.\nThe Sun shines by converting protons into \u03b1 particles. The overall reaction\n\n\f3\n\nSOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nTable 1: The pp chain in the Sun. The average number of pp neutrinos produced\nper termination in the Sun is 1.85.

The results are averaged over\nthe model of the current Sun. Since in essentially all terminations at least one\npp neutrino is produced and in a few terminations one pp and one pep neutrino\nare created, the total of pp and pep terminations exceeds 100%.\ncan be represented symbolically by the relation\n4p \u2192 \u03b1 + 2e+ + 2\u03bde + 25 MeV .\n\n(3)\n\nProtons are converted to \u03b1 particles, positrons, and neutrinos, with a release of\nabout 25 MeV of thermal energy for every four protons burned. Each conversion\nof four protons to an \u03b1 particle is known as a termination of the chain of energygenerating reactions that accomplishes the nuclear fusion. The thermal energy\nthat is supplied by nuclear fusion ultimately emerges from the surface of the\nSun as sunlight. About 600 million tons of hydrogen are burned every second to\nsupply the solar luminosity. Nuclear physicists have worked for half a century\nto determine the details of this transformation.\nThe main nuclear burning reactions in the Sun are shown in Table 1, which\nrepresents the energy-generating pp chain. This table also indicates the relative\nfrequency with which each reaction occurs in the standard solar model. For\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 1: Solar neutrino spectrum. This figure shows the energy spectrum of neutrinos predicted by the standard solar model(Bahcall and Pinsonneault 2004).\nThe neutrino fluxes from continuum sources (like pp and 8 B) are given in the\nunits of number per cm2 per second per MeV at one astronomical unit. The line\nfluxes (pep and 7 Be) are given in number per cm2 per sec. The spectra from\nthe pp chain (Table 1) are drawn with solid lines; the neutrino energy spectra\nfrom reactions with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO) isotopes are drawn\nwith dotted lines.\n\nsimplicity, we do not include in Table 1 nuclear reactions that involve isotopes of\ncarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO reactions). The CNO reactions contribute\nonly about 1% of the solar luminosity and relatively small neutrino fluxes (see\nFigure 1).\nThe fundamental reaction in the solar energy-generating process is the protonproton (pp) reaction, reaction 1a of Table 1, which produces the great majority\nof solar neutrinos. However, these p \u2212 p neutrinos have energies below the detection thresholds for the 37 Cl detector and all other solar neutrino experiments\ncarried out so far except radiochemical experiments that use 71 Ga as a detector\n(see below).\nMost of the predicted capture rate in the 37 Cl experiment comes from the\nrare termination in which 7 Be captures a proton to form radioactive 8 B (Bahcall\n1964, see reaction 7 of Table 1). The 8 B decays to unstable 8 Be, ultimately\nproducing two \u03b1 particles, a positron, and a neutrino. The neutrinos from 8 B\ndecay have a maximum energy of less than 15 MeV. Although the reactions\ninvolving 8 B occur only once in every 5000 terminations of the pp chain, the\n\n\f5\n\nSOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nTable 2: Calculated Solar Neutrino Fluxes and 1\u03c3 Uncertainties\nSource\npp\npep\nhep\n7\nBe\n8\nB\n13\nN\n15\nO\n17\nF\n\nFlux\n(1010 cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\n5.9(1 \u00b1 0.01)\n0.014(1 \u00b1 0.02)\n8(1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22127\n0.49(1 \u00b1 0.12)\n5.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1 \u00b1 0.23)\n0.06(1 \u00b1 0.4)\n0.05(1 \u00b1 0.4)\n6(1 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22124\n\npredicted event rates for the 37 Cl, Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, and SNO\nexperiments are dominated by this rare mode.\nThe neutrino energy spectrum predicted by the standard solar model is shown\nin Figure 1, where contributions from both line and continuum sources are\nincluded.\nThe solar neutrino fluxes at the Earth's surface that are calculated from the\nmost recent standard solar model (Bahcall and Pinsonneault 2004) are shown in\nTable 2. The 1\u03c3 uncertainties in the calculated neutrino fluxes are also shown\nin Table 2.\nThe beautiful 37 Cl experiment of Davis and his collaborators (Davis 1978,\nCleveland et al. 1998) was for two decades the only operating solar neutrino\ndetector. The reaction that was used for the detection of the neutrinos is\n\u03bde +37 Cl \u2192 e\u2212 +37 Ar ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich has a threshold energy of 0.8 MeV. The target was a tank containing 105\ngallons of C2 Cl4 (perchloroethylene, a cleaning fluid), deep in the Homestake\nGold Mine in Lead, South Dakota. The underground location was necessary\nin order to avoid background events from cosmic rays. Every few months, for\nalmost three decades, Davis and his collaborators extracted a small sample of\n37\nAr, typically of order 15 atoms, out of the total of more than 1030 atoms in the\ntank. The 37 Ar produced in the tank is separated chemically from the C2 Cl4 ,\npurified, and counted in low-background proportional counters. The typical\nbackground counting rate for the counters corresponds to about one radioactive\ndecay of an 37 Ar nucleus a month! Experiments have been performed to show\nthat 37 Ar produced in the tank is extracted with more than 90% efficiency.\nThe existence of the solar neutrino problem (see Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) sparked an\nintense debate about the origin of the problem. More importantly, the problem\nstimulated the construction and operation of five sophisticated new solar neutrino observatories. These observatories are: Kamiokande (a water Cherenkov\ndetector of neutrino-electron scattering in Japan), SAGE and GALLEX (radio-\n\n\f6\nchemical detectors, in Russia and in Italy, that observe neutrino absorption by\n71\nGa), Super-Kamiokande (a much larger version of the original Kamiokande\nwater Cherenkov detector), and the SNO detector (which detects neutrinos using heavy water, 2 H2 O).\nThe Kamiokande experiment (Kamiokande Collaboration 1996), located in\nthe Japanese Alps, detected Cherenkov light emitted by electrons that are scattered in the forward direction by solar neutrinos. The reaction by which the\nneutrinos are observed is\n\u03bd + e \u2192 \u03bd \u2032 + e\u2032 ,\n(5)\nwhere the primes on the outgoing particle symbols indicate that the momentum\nand energy of each particle can be changed by the scattering interactions. With\ntechniques that have been developed so far, only the higher-energy neutrinos\n(> 5 MeV, i. e., 8 B and hep neutrinos only) can be observed by neutrino-electron\nscattering.\nA much larger and more sensitive version of the Kamiokande experiment\n, known as Super-Kamiokande (Super-Kamiokande Collaboration 1998, 2001),\nfirst published new precision data in 1998. Neutrino\u2013electron scattering experiments furnish information about the incident neutrino energy spectrum (from\nmeasurements of the recoil energies of the scattered electrons), determine the\ndirection from which the neutrinos arrive, and record the precise time of each\nevent. Super-Kamiokande detected so many neutrino events (about 15 events\nper day, more than 5000 in total) that it inaugurated an era of precision measurements of multiple aspects of solar neutrino interactions.\nTwo radiochemical solar neutrino experiments using 71 Ga were performed,\none by a primarily Western European collaboration [with U.S. and Israeli participation (see GALLEX/GNO collaboration 1992,1999, 2000)] (GALLEX) and\nthe second by a group working in Russia (under conditions of hardship that\nsometimes required exceptional ingenuity and even heroism) with US participation (SAGE, see SAGE Collaboration 1994, 2002. The GALLEX collaboration\nused 30 tons of gallium in an aqueous solution; the detector is located in the\nGran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. The Soviet experiment uses about\n60 tons of gallium metal as a detector in a solar neutrino laboratory constructed\nunderneath a high mountain in the Baksan Valley in the Caucasus Mountains\nof the Soviet Union. The amount of detector material used in each of these\nexperiments is impressive considering that, at the time the experimental techniques were developed, the total world production of gallium was only 10 tons\nper year!\nThe gallium experiments provide unique information about the most common\nnuclear reaction fusion reaction in the Sun, the p \u2212 p reaction (see reaction 1a of\nTable 1). The absorption reaction by which neutrinos are detected with gallium\nis\n\u03bde +71 Ga \u2192 e\u2212 +71 Ge .\n(6)\nThe germanium atoms are removed chemically from the gallium and the radioactive decays of 71 Ge are measured in small proportional counters. The\nthreshold for absorption of neutrinos by 71 Ga is 0.23 MeV, which is well below\n\n\f7\n\nSOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nthe maximum energy of the p \u2212 p neutrinos. The independent GALLEX/GNO\nand SAGE experiments yield results that are in good agreement with each other.\nAt this writing, no other solar neutrino experiment has a demonstrated capability to detect the low-energy neutrinos from the basic p \u2212 p reaction, although\nseveral detectors are being developed that could observe electrons produced by\nneutrino-electron scattering or by absorption of p \u2212 p neutrinos.\nThe Sudbury Solar Neutrino Observatory (see SNO Collaboration 2001,2002,\n2004) is a powerful 1-kiloton heavy water (D2 O) experiment that is located in\nan INCO nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario (Canada). The deuterium (denoted\nby D or by 2 H) experiment is a collaboration between Canadian, American, and\nBritish scientists. Like the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande detectors, the\nSNO deuterium detector measures the energy and direction of recoil electrons\nby observing their Cherenkov light with photomultipliers. Thus SNO can also\nobserve neutrino-electron scattering, see Eq. (5).\nMore importantly, SNO can observe two unique reactions. The first reaction\ndetects only electron type neutrinos and can be written\n\u03bde + D \u2192 e \u2212 + p + p .\n\n(7)\n\nThe second reaction is equally sensitive to neutrinos of all types, \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 ,\nand can be written\n\u03bd + D \u2192 \u03bd\u2032 + n + p .\n(8)\nThe SNO detector can measure the all-neutrino reaction, Eq. (8), (also called\na 'neutral current' reaction) in several different ways.\nFigure 2 compares the rates measured in all seven of the solar neutrino experiments with the rates predicted by the combined standard model: the standard\nsolar model plus the standard model of electroweak interactions. With the\nexception of the neutral-current detection of SNO, all of the measurements disagree with the predictions of the combined standard solar and particle physics\nmodel.\nThe Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, and SNO experiments are sensitive to\n8\nB and hep neutrinos, but the other solar neutrinos that are shown in Figure 1\nare below the experimental energy thresholds. The thresholds are set at several\nMeV in order to avoid numerous lower-energy background events. Only the\ngallium experiments are sensitive to the fundamental p \u2212 p neutrinos and only\nthe gallium and chlorine experiments are sensitive to the neutrinos from 7 Be\nand from the CNO sources of neutrinos (13 N, 15 O, and 17 F).\nNeutrino absorption, exemplified by reactions Eq. (4), Eq. (6), and Eq. (7),\nis sensitive only to electron-type neutrinos, \u03bde , whose type (flavor) is unchanged\nin transit to the Earth. For neutrino\u2013electron scattering, Eq. (5), the cross\nsection for \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 at the energies of interest is about one-seventh the cross\nsection for \u03bde . Neutrino\u2013electron scattering is primarily sensitive to \u03bde but has a\nsmall sensitivity to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 . The SNO experiment includes a detection mode\nthat is equally sensitive to all three types of neutrinos, Eq. (8). In this neutralcurrent mode, deuterium nuclei are disintegrated into their constituent neutrons\nand protons without changing the charge of the nucleons. The measurement of\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 2: Comparison of measured rates and standard-model predictions for seven\nsolar neutrino experiments. The unit for the radiochemical experiments (chlorine and gallium) is SNU (10\u221236 interactions per target atom per sec); the\nunit for the water-Cerenkov experiments (Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, and\nSNO) is the rate predicted by the standard solar model plus standard electroweak theory.\nthe neutral-current disintegration of deuterium provides a determination of the\ntotal flux of solar neutrinos above the energy threshold, about 2.2 MeV, for the\nreaction shown in Eq. (8).\nOn June 18th, 2001 at about 12 noon EDT the SNO collaboration announced\nthe first scientific results of their epochal experiment. Combining the SNO\nmeasurements of \u03bde (Eq. 7) from 8 B neutrinos produced in the Sun with the\nprecise Super-Kamiokande measurement of neutrino-electron scattering (Eq. 5),\nthe SNO collaboration solved the 33 year old solar neutrino problem. About\ntwo-thirds of the 8 B \u03bde produced in the Sun are transformed into the more\ndifficult to detect \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 on their way from the center of the Sun to detectors\non Earth. Moreover, the total number of neutrinos of all types (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 )\nis equal, within the uncertainties, to the value predicted by the standard solar\nmodel.\nThe fact that most of the neutrinos that come to us from the Sun are transformed in flight from \u03bde to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 explains why the radiochemical experi-\n\n\f9\n\nSOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nments, chlorine and gallium see less than the predicted total number of neutrinos. The radiochemical experiments only detect \u03bde . The metamorphosis from\n\u03bde to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 also explains why the neutrino-electron scattering experiments,\nKamiokande and Super-Kamiokande, see a deficit of neutrinos. The neutrinoelectron scattering experiments are primarily, but not entirely, sensitive to \u03bde .\nThe SNO and Super-Kamiokande measurements together established two\nextraordinarily important conclusions. 1) Physics not included in the standard\nmodel of particle physics occurs. Neutrinos change their type. 2) The neutrino measurements confirm the theoretical model of how the Sun shines. The\nmeasured flux of neutrinos from 8 B beta-decay, which depends approximately\non the 25th power of the central temperature of the Sun, is in good agreement\nwith the theoretical calculations.\nIn short, the solar neutrino experiments showed that the standard model of\nparticle physics is incomplete and the standard solar model is vindicated.\nSubsequent measurements by the SNO and other solar neutrino experimental\ncollaborations have confirmed and refined the original inferences announced in\nJune, 2001.\nLet's step back in time for a moment to establish the theoretical particle\nphysics context. The physics community was electrified in 1985 when an elegant theoretical solution for the solar neutrino problem was proposed that is\nconsistent with expectations from Grand Unified Theories (GUT) of neutrino\nmass. According to this solution, a \u03bde created in the solar interior is almost completely converted into \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 as the neutrino passes through the Sun. This\nconversion reflects the enhancement by the matter in the Sun of the probability\nthat a neutrino of an electron type oscillates into a neutrino of a different type;\nit is universally referred to as the Mikheyev\u2013Smirnov\u2013Wolfenstein (MSW) effect\nin honor of its discoverers.\nIn order for the MSW effect to occur, the flavor eigenstates \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4\nmust be different from the mass eigenstates. The flavor eigenstates are created\nin weak decays and have weak interactions with their associated charged leptons\n(electron, muon, and tau) that can be written in a simple (diagonal) form. The\nmass eigenstates, which have diagonal mass matrices, are the states in which\nneutrinos propagate in a vacuum. The mass eigenstates are often denoted by \u03bd1 ,\n\u03bd2 , and \u03bd3 . For a simplified description in terms of two eigenstates, the relation\nbetween flavor and mass eigenstates in vacuum is described by a single mixing\nangle \u03b812 , where tan \u03b812 is the relative amplitude of \u03bd2 and \u03bd1 in the \u03bde wave\nfunction (\u03bde = cos \u03b812 \u03bd1 + sin \u03b812 \u03bd2 ). The difference in the squares of the masses\nof the two neutrinos is denoted by \u2206m221 = m22 \u2212 m21 .\nAll of the available data on solar, atmospheric, and reactor neutrino masses\nare consistent with an MSW description of neutrino propagation. A recent determination of neutrino parameters using all the available data yields (Bahcall,\nGonzalez-Garcia, and Pe\u00f1a-Garay 2004):\n\n\u22125\neV2 ,\n\u2206m221 = 8.2+0.3\n\u22120.3 \u00d7 10\n\n(9)\n\n\f10\nand\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.39+0.05\n\u22120.04 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe same solution analyzing all of the data yields the values given below for\nthe total flux of pp neutrinos, \u03c6(pp), and the total flux of 8 B neutrinos, \u03c6(8 B),\nboth expressed in terms of the values predicted by the standard solar model.\n\u03c6(pp) = 1.01 \u00b1 0.02(experimental) \u00b1 0.01(theory) ,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c6(8 B = 0.87 \u00b1 0.04(experimental) \u00b1 0.23(theory) .\n\n(12)\n\nThe uncertainties indicated in Eq. (9)-Eq. (12) are \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainties.\nBibliography\nJ. N. Bahcall, Phys. Rev. Lett. 12, 300 (1964).
