We also point out that Higgs searches at the LHC might\nadditionally provide the first evidence of R-parity violation.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson is probably the most important goal of the LHC. In the\nStandard Model, the Higgs branching ratios depend only on the unknown Higgs mass, which\nis constrained to be larger than 114 GeV. In the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) the Higgs sector is more involved, as it includes two Higgs doublets [1]. Yet, the\nmass of the lightest Higgs is very restricted, typically below 135 GeV. Another remarkable\nfeature of the MSSM Higgs is that it may decay into two light neutralinos. Besides being\ninvisible, such a decay causes a suppression of all other branching ratios of the Higgs boson,\nrendering more difficult its observation. In R-parity violating models, however, a new twist\noccurs. There, the neutralino is unstable and may decay within the detector into Standard\nModel fermions. Thus, the decay h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7, with \u03c7 subsequently decaying into light particles,\nbecomes visible and new signals for Higgs decays at colliders appear. That is exactly the\nsituation we aim to study in this paper.\nThe most general supersymmetric version of the Standard Model is phenomenologically\ninconsistent, for it includes lepton and baryon number violating operators that would induce\nfast proton decay. In the MSSM, an ad hoc discrete symmetry known as R-parity is imposed\nto prevent the decay of the proton. R-parity additionally implies the conservation of lepton\nand baryon number as well as the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle \u2013the LSP.\nAssuming R-parity, however, is not the only way of preventing proton decay. Lepton parity\nand baryon triality [2] are among the alternative discrete symmetries that forbid proton\ndecay but allow for R-parity violation and, respectively, baryon or lepton number breaking\ncouplings. R-parity, therefore, is not an essential ingredient of low energy supersymmetry.\nSupersymmetric models with broken R-parity are well motivated extensions of the Standard Model and have been amply considered in the literature. They feature a rich phenomenology, markedly different from that of the MSSM. The LSP, for instance, is unstable\nand consequently it is no longer bound to be a neutralino; any supersymmetric particle\ncan be the LSP [3]. And since the LSP decays into Standard Model fermions, distinctive\ndecay patterns and collider signals are expected [4, 5, 6]. R-parity violation might also be\nat the origin of neutrino masses and mixing [7]. The bilinear R-parity violating model, in\nparticular, not only accounts for the observed values of neutrino masses and mixing angles\n[8, 9] but it also predicts simple correlations between them and the LSP decay branching\nratios [10, 11, 4, 5, 6]. These unique signals of R-parity violating models may soon be tested\nat the LHC as well as at future colliders.\nThe mass of the lightest neutralino is not constrained by accelerator searches or precision\nexperiments [12, 13]. If the GUT relation between gaugino masses is assumed, then the\nLEP limit on the chargino mass, m\u03c7\u00b1 & 100 GeV [14], translates into a lower bound on the\nneutralino mass: M1 \u223c m\u03c7 & 50 GeV[14]. If the assumption of gaugino mass unification is\nnot made, however, there is no general limit on the mass of the lightest neutralino. Thus,\nneutralinos with masses below 50 GeV, light neutralinos, are perfectly compatible with\npresent experiments.\nFor the MSSM, the implications of such light neutralinos in Higgs boson decays were\nrecently studied in [15]. There, after examining the dependence of the h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 branching\nratio with the relevant supersymmetric parameters, it was shown that the decay into two\nneutralinos can even be the dominant decay mode of the Higgs boson, with a branching\n1\n\n\fCoupling\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032112\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032113\n\u03bb\u2032111\n\u03bb\u2032i33\n\u03bbi33\n\nUpper bound\n10\u22127\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n\nTable 1: Strongest bounds on the R-parity violating couplings.\nratio as large as 80%. Here, we extend such an analysis to supersymmetric models with\nR-parity violation. The R-parity violating couplings may cause the decay of the neutralino\nwithin the detector, transforming the former invisible decay h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 into a visible one.\nWe will consider both bilinear and trilinear R-parity violating operators and study the\ndifferent 3-body neutralino decays they induce. These decays give rise to novel Higgs decay\nsignals that could be searched for at colliders. The most interesting searches are final states\ncontaining missing energy and isolated charged leptons such as l\u00b1 l\u2213 , l\u00b1 l\u00b1 , 3l, and 4l. In\naddition to these standard searches, the neutralino decay length can be long enough to leave\na displaced vertex in the detector [4, 16, 17]. These searches may facilitate the discovery\nof the Higgs boson at the LHC and at the same time provide direct evidence of R-parity\nviolation.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we discuss briefly the model\nconsidered as well as the constraints on the R-parity violating couplings. Section 3 is devoted\nto neutralino decays and presents our main results. The decay length is studied and several\nscenarios, in which different neutralino final states are present, are analyzed. Finally in\nsection 4 we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe R-parity violating model\n\nThe most general supersymmetric version of the Standard Model has a renormalizable superpotential given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\na\nb\n\u2032\na\nb\na\nb\nb L\nb b\nb b b\nb b\nW = WMSSM + \u03b5ab \u03bbijk L\ni j Ek + \u03bbijk Li Qj Dk + \u01ebi Li Hu\n2\n1\nb\u03b1D\nb \u03b2D\nb\u03c3 ,\n+\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3 \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk U\n(1)\ni\nk\nj\n2\n\nwhere WMSSM is the lepton and baryon number conserving superpotential. In eq. (1), i, j, k\nrun over the fermion generations, a, b are SU(2) indices, and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3 are color indices. The\nbilinear couplings \u01ebi , i = 1, 2, 3, have mass dimension one and break lepton number. \u03bb\nand \u03bb\u2032 are dimensionless trilinear couplings that also break lepton number. There are 27\nindependent \u03bb\u2032ijk but only 9 \u03bbijk \u2013they are antisymmetric in i, j. Baryon number is broken\nby the dimensionless couplings \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk , 9 of which are independent. In all, therefore, the Rparity violating superpotential contains 48 additional parameters. In addition there are the\ncorresponding soft SUSY breaking terms.\n2\n\n\fTo prevent proton decay, in the MSSM all the operators in (1) are forbidden by assuming\nthe discrete symmetry known as R-parity. From a phenomenological point of view, however,\nthe stability of the proton only requires that baryon and lepton number violating operators\nnot be simultaneously allowed. And R-parity is not the only discrete symmetry able to\nensure that. Baryon-triality and lepton-parity [2], for instance, are two well motivated\nsymmetries that allow for either lepton or baryon number violating couplings, breaking\nR-parity but keeping the proton stable.\nOnce R-parity is broken, the stability of the LSP is no longer guaranteed. The R-parity\nbreaking terms in eq. (1) in fact induce the decay of the neutralino -mediated by a gauge\nboson or a scalar- to three Standard Model fermions. Such a decay constitutes the main\ndifference between the MSSM and the R-parity violating model.\nLow energy data put a strong bound on some of the R-parity violating couplings in (1).\nFor the bilinear couplings \u01ebi , the most stringent constraint\nphysics. The\nPcomes from neutrino\n2\natmospheric mass scale can be generated at tree level if i (\u01ebi vd + \u03bcvi ) /Det(m\u03c7 ) \u223c m\u03bd /M2\nwhere Det(m\u03c7 ) is the determinant of the MSSM neutralino mass matrix, M2 the SU(2)\ngaugino mass, vi and vd are the sneutrinos and Hd vacuum expectations values. The solar\nmass scale, on the other hand, is induced only at the loop level and constrains the ratio\n\u22123\n|\u01ebi /\u03bc| <\n\u223c 10 . For the trilinear couplings the strongest bounds come from double nucleon\ndecay [18], neutron oscillations [18, 19], neutrino masses [20, 21], and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay [22]. A complete and detailed list of the different constraints on the trilinear\ncouplings can be found in [23, 24]. The most important ones are summarized, for further\nuse, in Table 1. Note here, that in principle one can rotate the \"four vector\" (\u0124d , L\u0302i ) such\nthat the bilinear terms are absent in the superpotential eq. (1) on the expense of changing\nthe values of \u03bbijk and \u03bb\u2032ijk (see e.g. [6]). The bounds in this table have to be understood in\nthis particular basis.\n\n3\n\nNeutralino decays\n\nThe branching ratio h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 depends mainly on \u03bc, tan \u03b2, and m\u03c7 [15], whereas the subsequent neutralino decay is determined by m\u03c7 , the Rp violating couplings and gauge bosons\nor scalar masses. To study the decay of neutralinos originating in Higgs decays, we will\nconsider a generic class of supersymmetric models featuring a non-negligible BR(h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7)\nwhere all the parameters but the slepton and the squark masses are kept fixed. We take\nM1 = 35 GeV, \u03bc = 300 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 5 ,\nM2 = M3 = MA = 1 TeV ,\nAt = \u22121.7 TeV ,\nmq\u0303 > 800 GeV ,\nml\u0303 > 200 GeV.\n\n(2)\n\nThe supersymmetric spectra thus obtained, illustrated in figure 3, satisfy the constraints\nfrom accelerator searches [14], the Higgs mass [25], (g \u2212 2)\u03bc [14, 26], and b \u2192 s\u03b3 [27]. To\ncompute the spectrum and to evaluate the Higgs mass and other observables we use the\nFeynHiggs program [28]. According to it, lighter squarks -with all other parameters fixedare not compatible with the LEP bound on the Higgs mass.\n3\n\n\f1400\n\n1200\n~\n1000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c7 4,\u03c7\n\nmass (GeV)\n\nH ,A ,H\n\nt2\n\n+\n\n~\n\ng\n\n2\n\n800\n\n~~\n\nb,q\n600\n\n~\n\nt1\n\n400\n0\n\n200\n\n~ ~\n\u03bd,\ne\n\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c7 2,\u03c7 3,\u03c7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u03c7\n\n0\n\nh\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFigure 1: The typical supersymmetric spectrum we consider.\n\nNotice that for simplicity we assumed common soft-breaking masses for sleptons and\nsquarks 1 as well as a typical value of 1 TeV for M2 , M3 and MA . Since MA \u226b MZ we are\nin fact working in the decoupling limit, where the interactions of the lightest Higgs boson\nbecome SM-like.\nRegarding tan \u03b2, \u03bc, and M1 , they were chosen so as to be in a region where BR(h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7)\nis non-negligible, and their values are rather typical within that region. Specifically, we get\nBR(h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7)= 21%, being bb\u0304 the dominant decay mode with BR(h \u2192 bb\u0304)= 59%. As\nM1 \u226a M2 , \u03bc, the lightest neutralino is dominantly a bino, but it has a small higgsino\ncomponent that generates the non-zero h\u03c7\u03c7 coupling.\nIf the neutralino decays outside the detector no new collider signals due to R-parity\nviolating couplings are expected, as we would essentially be back to the MSSM case, where\nthe decay h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 is invisible. We must, therefore, ensure that a significant number of\nneutralinos decays inside the detector. At the LHC, the Higgs is mainly produced through\ngluon fusion and its production cross section is huge \u2013about 45 pb for our model. So,\nthe neutralino decay length could be large and still yield a significant number of neutralino\ndecays within the detector. This fact is illustrated in figure 2, where we quantify the fraction\nof neutralinos that decay inside a typical detector as a function of the decay length. This\nfigure was generated with the PYTHIA program, version 6.414 [29], by taking into account\nonly the production of the lightest CP-even Higgs. The MSSM parameters were varied\naccording to eq. (2) whereas a specific R-parity violating coupling was varied in the range\n[10\u22124 ,10\u22121 ]. The points were selected by imposing the condition that the neutralino decays\ntake place inside a cylinder of 3 m in the z direction and 0.9 m of radius, e.g. well inside the\ninner ATLAS or the inner CMS detector. From the figure we see, for instance, that if the\nproper neutralino lifetime is 10 m, about 7% of the decays will occur within the detector.\nNotice therefore that the predicted number of events will depend on the value of the R-parity\n1\n\nThe observed splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates is due to the non-zero value of the\nparameter At\n\n4\n\n\f10000\n\n0\n\n\u03c7 lifetime (m)\n\n100\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\nrest frame\nlab frame\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nfraction\n\nFigure 2: The relation between the fraction of neutralinos that decay within the detector\nand the neutralino decay length considering only neutralinos from Higgs decays.\nviolating couplings.\nIn what follows we will discuss the non-standard decays [13] of the Higgs boson that are\ninduced by the R-parity violating couplings.\n\n3.1\n\nDecays induced by bilinear terms\n\nBilinear broken R-parity models are theoretically well motivated scenarios. They provide a\nsimple framework that accounts for the observed values of neutrino parameters and that, in\ncontrast with the seesaw mechanism, can be tested, through the decay properties of the LSP,\nin accelerator experiments. These models contain six lepton number violating parameters\n[30, 31]: \u01ebi , and their corresponding soft-breaking terms. These parameters are not entirely\nfree, they are constrained by neutrino oscillation data. At present, the experimental data\non neutrino oscillations indicates that [32, 33]:\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.47 \u00b1 0.05,\n\ntan2 \u03b823 = 0.83+0.35\n\u22120.17 ,\n\n\u22125\n\u2206m221 = 7.67+0.22\neV2 ,\n\u22120.21 \u00d7 10\n\nsin2 \u03b813 < 0.019\n\n\u2206m231 = 2.46 \u00b1 0.15 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn our analysis, we will demand compatibility at the 1\u03c3 level between these data and the\nsix bilinear parameters.\nNeutralino decays in bilinear broken R-parity models are due to the mixing between\nneutralinos and neutrinos. The bilinear soft breaking terms, indeed, induce non-zero vevs\nfor the sneutrinos that give rise to a mixing between leptons and gauginos and between\nsleptons and higgses. Such mixing allows the neutralino to decay -via a Z 0 , W \u00b1 , sfermion\nor Higgs exchange- into the final states \u03bdi \u03bdj \u03bdk , \u03bdi q q\u0304, \u03bdi lj+ lk\u2212 or l\u00b1 qq \u2032 .\nApart from these contributions induced by the mixing, there are additional ones due to\nthe effective trilinear couplings [6] \u03bb233 = h\u03c4 \u01eb2 /\u03bc and \u03bb\u2032333 = hb \u01eb3 /\u03bc. These new contribu5\n\n\fFigure 3: The neutralino lifetime as a function of the slepton mass for different values of the\nbilinear R-parity violating couplings consistent with neutrino oscillation data at 1 \u03c3 level.\ntions, mediated by slepton and squarks, give rise to neutralino decays into the final states\n\u03bd\u03c4 \u03c4 , \u03bd\u03bc\u03c4 , and \u03bdbb\u0304.\nFigure 3 shows the neutralino lifetime as a function of the slepton mass for models with\nbilinear R-parity violation. The supersymmetric spectrum was chosen according to equation\n(2) and the figure was generated with a private version of SPheno2 [34] that includes bilinear\nR-parity violation. For any given value of the slepton mass, there is a spread in the neutralino\nlifetime that is due to the uncertainty on neutrino parameters. From the figure we see that\nthe neutralino decay length has an upper bound of roughly 8 meters and that it is always\nlarger than about 50cm. That means that, according to figure 2, between 7% and 40% of\nneutralino decays will occur within the detector.\nTwo different regions can be easily distinguished from figure 3. For low slepton masses,\nml\u0303 . 800GeV, the neutralino lifetime increases with the slepton mass. Neutralino decays\nin this region are thus mediated by sleptons and induced by the effective trilinear couplings.\nFor larger slepton masses, instead, the neutralino lifetime becomes essentially independent\nof ml\u0303 . In this region neutralino decays are mediated by gauge bosons and induced directly\nby the mixing. This picture is confirmed by figure 4, where we show the corresponding\nneutralino branching ratios as a function of the slepton mass. As expected, the dominant\ndecay modes at low slepton masses are \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 \u03bd and \u03c4 \u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd (l = e, \u03bc) whereas for large slepton\nmasses several final states have sizeable branching ratios.\n2\n\nThis version can be obtained from W.P.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Neutralino decay branching ratios as a function of the slepton mass. The bilinear\nR-parity violating couplings are consistent with neutrino oscillation data at 1 \u03c3 level.\nModels with bilinear R-parity violation have thus two remarkable features. On the one\nhand, the neutralino lifetime can be predicted with certain confidence. It lies between 50\ncm and about 8 meters; so it is rather large but it has a known upper bound. On the\nother hand, the neutralino decay products are rather uncertain and strongly depend on the\nsfermion masses. However, certain rations of branching ratios are predicted in terms of\nneutrino mixing angles [4]. In general, several final states with sizable branching ratios are\nexpected.\n\n3.2\n\nDecays induced by trilinear terms\n\nThe R-parity violating couplings \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032, \u03bb\u2032\u2032 induce 3-body neutralino decays into Standard\nModel particles. To study such decays, we assume that, in turn, only one of the couplings,\nsay \u03bb122 , dominates and all others are negligible. First we consider the baryon number\nviolating couplings \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk , and then the lepton number violating \u03bb\u2032ijk and \u03bbijk . For each case\nwe compute the neutralino lifetime, \u03c4\u03c7 , as a function of the couplings and the sfermion\nmasses. With that information, we determine the range of R-parity violating parameters\nthat lead to neutralino decays inside the detector, find the new Higgs decay signals they\ninduce, and briefly analyze the possibility of observing them at colliders.\nFor simplicity, we work in the approximation where all final state fermions are massless3 .\nThis approximation breaks down only if there is a top quark in the final state. Such a decay,\n3\n\nWe have checked that even taking mb properly into account changes the total width only slightly.\n\n7\n\n\fhowever, is not kinematically allowed. The neutralino decay width, then, has the generic\nform\ncf g 2{\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032\u2032 }2 m5\u03c7\nf (mf \u0303),\n(4)\n\u0393\u03c7 =\n1536\u03c0 3\nwhere cf is the color factor, { } denotes one of the couplings, and f (mf \u0303) is a function of\ndimension m\u22124 that depends on the masses of the intermediate sfermions [35].\n3.2.1\n\nDecays induced by \u03bb\u2032\u2032\n\nThe trilinear coupling \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk may induce the decay of neutralinos into 3-quark final states, such\n \u0304 and csb, leading to a Higgs boson that decays into a six-quark final state. Such decays\nas \u016bds\u0304\nwere previously considered in [36], albeit in a different scenario. Indeed, it was assumed\nin [36] that the Higgs boson had a mass around 100 GeV and had been missed by LEP\nsearches because of its dominant decay into six quarks. Such a situation, however, is only\npossible in a very restricted portion of the viable parameter space. We, instead, consider a\nmore generic framework where the Higgs is compatible with the usual LEP bound and has\na non-dominant BR(h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7).\nThree different diagrams, respectively mediated by \u0169i , d \u0303j , and d \u0303k , contribute to the\nneutralino decay induced by a given \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk . The possible final states are ui dj dk (j 6= k) and\nits conjugate \u016bi d \u0304j d \u0304k . Hence, the total decay width is simply given by \u0393\u03c7 = 2\u0393(\u03c7 \u2192 ui dj dk ).\nBesides \u03bb\u2032\u2032 , \u0393\u03c7 will only depend on the squark masses. Figure 5 shows the neutralino lifetime\nas a function of the squark mass for \u03bb\u2032\u2032 = 10\u22121 , 10\u22122, 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 . The resulting neutralino\nlifetime varies, for mq\u0303 < 1.6 TeV, approximately between 100 \u03bcm and 1 km.\nNotice that the decays induced by the couplings \u03bb\u2032\u20323jk are kinematically forbidden, as they\ngive rise to final states containing a top quark. Moreover, due to the strong constraint that\nexist on \u03bb\u2032\u2032112 and \u03bb\u2032\u2032113 , see Table 1, neutralino decays into uds and udb are very suppressed\nand take place outside the detector.\nThe unique signal from Higgs decays in this case is then a six-quark final state. But it is\nnot known whether such signal could be observed over the QCD background. An interesting\npossibility, put forward in [37], is the search -at LHCb- for the displaced vertices associated\nwith the neutralino decay. As observed in figure 5, the neutralino decay length may be larger\nthan 100\u03bcm, leaving a displaced vertex; and the LHCb detector, in contrast to ATLAS and\nCMS, is well suited to study such events.\n3.2.2\n\nDecays induced by \u03bb\u2032\n\nNeutralino decays induced by the trilinear coupling \u03bb\u2032 contain leptons in the final state and\nare, therefore, easier to observe. An analysis related to ours was presented several years ago\nin [38]. They considered the special case of Higgs production through vector boson fusion\nand studied the Higgs signals induced by only certain trilinear couplings \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 assuming\ngaugino mass unification.\nThe coupling \u03bb\u2032ijk gives rise to two different final states (plus their conjugates):\n\u03c7 \u2192 ei uj d \u0304k ,\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bdi dj d \u0304k .\n8\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\f100\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n\u03c7 lifetime (m)\n\n1\n\n1e-4\n\n\u03bb``ijk= 0.1\n\u03bb``ijk= 0.01\n\u03bb``ijk= 0.001\n\u03bb``ijk= 0.0001\n\n1e-6\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nSquark Mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 5: The neutralino lifetime as a function of the squark mass for different values of the\nR-parity violating couplings \u03bb\u2032\u2032 .\nAnd each of them receives contributions from three different diagrams. The decay (5) may\nhave \u1ebdi , \u0169j , and d \u0303k as intermediate particles while \u03bd\u0303i , d \u0303j and d \u0303k mediate the process (6).\nThe total neutralino decay width is then given by\n\u0393\u03c7 = 2(\u0393(\u03c7 \u2192 ei uj d \u0304k ) + \u0393(\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bdi dj d \u0304k )).\n\n(7)\n\nIn this case the neutralino decay width depends on \u03bb\u2032 , the squark masses, and the slepton\nmasses. We show, in figure 6, the neutralino decay length as a function of the slepton mass\nfor \u03bb\u2032 = 10\u22121 , 10\u22122 , 10\u22123, 10\u22124 and mq\u0303 = 800 GeV. Notice that for large slepton masses,\nthe diagrams mediated by squarks tend to dominate over those mediated by sleptons and\nconsequently the curve becomes rather flat. From the figure we see that the neutralino\nlifetime varies, for ml\u0303 < 1.6 TeV, between 0.1\u03bcm and 100m. Given that the final state ei td \u0304k\nis not kinematically allowed, the couplings \u03bb\u2032i3k induce neutralino decays only into \u03bdi bd \u0304k .\nFor those couplings, therefore, the neutralino lifetime is actually a factor of two larger than\nshown in figure 6.\nThe possible signatures of the decay of the Higgs boson due to the coupling \u03bb\u2032 are:\n1. Zero lepton, jets, and missing energy.\n2. One lepton, jets, and missing energy.\n3. Opposite sign lepton pair and jets.\n4.

The decays induced by the couplings \u03bbi3k always give rise\nto jets plus missing energy signals. Even after the degrading in missing energy compared\nwith the case of stable neutralino, the signal with jets and neutrinos, which has at least a\n50% branching, has good potential to be discovered at the LHC [17]. A generic expectation\nof this scenario is that the Higgs should be discovered at LHCb [37].\n3.2.3\n\nDecays induced by \u03bb\n\nThe couplings \u03bbijk induce neutralino decays into final states containing two charged leptons\nand one neutrino. A given \u03bbijk might lead to two different final states (plus their conjugates):\n\u03c7 \u2192 ei \u03bdj \u0113k\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03bdi ej \u0113k .\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nHence, a neutrino is always present in the final state. As before, three different diagrams\ncontribute to each final state and the resulting decay width simply scales as 1/m4l\u0303 . Figure\n7 shows the neutralino decay length as a function of the common slepton mass for different\nvalues of the coupling \u03bb.\nThe two signatures with missing energy we mentioned in 3.2.2 -numerals 1 and 2- will\nalso be present in this case, though the jets come from the hadronic decay of the tau lepton\nand not from final state quarks. Additionally, the \u03bb couplings also give rise to new signatures\nwith two or more leptons. They are\n1.

These new signatures with two or more leptons are\nparticularly significant because thanks to their low backgrounds they have good chances to\nbe discovered at LHC [17, 39].\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe studied the decay of the Higgs boson into Standard Model particles within the context\nof the MSSM with R-parity violation. The decay proceeds via h \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 followed by the Rparity violating neutralino decay into light fermions. We pointed out that neutralino decays\ninduced by the trilinear R-parity violating couplings may occur inside the detector and, as\na result, give rise to novel Higgs decay signatures that may facilitate the discovery of the\nHiggs boson at the LHC. Particularly appealing -because of their low backgrounds- are the\ndecays into final states containing three or four leptons and missing energy. Such decays\nare caused by the lepton-number violating couplings \u03bbijk and could be easily observed at\nthe LHC. Another promising possibility is the observation of displaced vertices associated\nwith the neutralino decay. Thus, the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC might also\nprovide direct evidence of R-parity violation.\n\n11\n\n\f5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWork partially supported by Colciencias in Colombia under contract 1115-333-18740.
