To this\nend, we modify the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model into the one evolving under the principle of division and independence as well as growth and preferential attachment (PA). A newly added vertex chooses one of the modules\ncomposed of existing vertices, and attaches edges to vertices belonging to that module following the PA rule.\nWhen the module size reaches a proper size, the module is divided into two, and a new module is created.\nThe karate club network studied by Zachary is a prototypical example. We find that the model can reproduce\nsuccessfully the behavior of the hierarchical clustering coefficient of a vertex with degree k, C(k), in good\nagreement with empirical measurements of real world networks.\nPACS numbers: 89.65.-s, 89.75.Hc, 89.75.Da\n\nRecently, considerable effort has been made to understand\ncomplex systems in terms of random graphs, consisting of vertices and edges [1, 2, 3, 4]. Such complex networks exhibit\nmany interesting emerging patterns as follows: First, the degree distribution follows a power-law, P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , where\nthe degree is the number of edges connecting to a given vertex [5]. Such networks, called scale-free (SF), are ubiquitous\nin the real world. To illustrate such SF behavior in the degree distribution, Barab\u00e1si and Albert (BA) [5] introduced an\nin silico model: Initially, fully-connected m0 vertices exist in\na system. At each time step, a vertex is newly added and connects to m existing vertices, which are chosen with a probability linearly proportional to the degree of target vertex. Such\na selection rule is called the preferential attachment (PA) rule.\nSecondly, many real world networks have modular structures within them. Modular structures form geographically in\nthe Internet [6], functionally in metabolic [7] or protein interaction networks [8], or following social activities in social\nnetworks [9, 10]. In these modular complex networks, the\nhierarchical clustering coefficient of a vertex with degree k,\ndenoted by C(k), behaves as C(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b2 [7, 11], where the\nclustering coefficient is defined as the ratio of the number of\ntriangles connected to a given vertex to the number of triples\ncentered on that vertex. Also the clustering coefficient averaged over all vertices is independent of system size N . In\nthe BA model, however, C(k) is independent of k, but depends on N [2, 11], because the BA model does not contain\nmodules. To understand the behavior of C(k), a deterministic hierarchical model was introduced by Ravasz and Barab\u00e1si\n[11], in which C(k) \u223c k \u22121 and the clustering coefficient C\nis independent of N [12]. While it is important to understand\nthe mechanism for the formation of such modular structure\nthrough an in silico model, few models have been studied, and\nnone in which the modules were generated in a self-organized\nway. Thus it is our goal of this paper to introduce such a\nmodel.\nThirdly, the degree-degree correlation in real world networks is nontrivial. The nontrivial behavior is measured in\nterms of the mixing coefficient r [13], a Pearson correlation\n\ncoefficient between the remaining degrees of the two vertices\non each side of an edge, where the remaining degree means\nthe degree of that vertex minus one. Complex networks can\nbe classified according to the mixing coefficient r into three\ntypes, having r < 0, r \u2248 0, and r > 0, called the dissortative,\nthe neutral, and the assortative network, respectively [13]. An\nassortative or dissorative network can also be identified by a\nquantity, denoted by hknn i(k), the average degree of a neighboring vertex of a vertex with degree k [14]. For the assortative (dissortative) network, hknn i(k) increases (decreases)\nwith increasing k, i.e., a power law hknn i(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03bd is satisfied where \u03bd is negative (positive) for the assortative (dissortative) network [14].\nIn this paper, we are interested in modelling modular\ncomplex networks, in particular, forming in a self-organized\nway. In social networks, modules represent the communities each individual belongs to, which may evolve as time\npasses. The karate club (KC) network, originally proposed\nby Zachary [15], is an example of a social network containing community structures. Recently, Newman and Girvan [9]\nstudied the KC network to test a new algorithm for clustering communities [9, 16]. Here we notice that the KC network\n\nFIG. 1: A snapshot of the model network with parameters N = 34,\nm0 = 4 and n = 17, looking similar to the Karate club network\nproposed by Zachary. Here two groups are identified by (\u25e6) and (\u2022).\n\n\f2\ncontains an important ingredient, division and independence,\nneeded for the formation of modular structure, in addition to\ngrowth and PA principles as noticed in the BA model. Thus\nwe introduce a network model evolving by such principles,\nand perform numerical simulations for large system size. Indeed, we find that the model exhibits a characteristic feature\nof modular structure, C(k) \u223c k \u22121 as much as those for empirical data.\nTo be specific, the main dynamic process of the evolution\nof the KC network is as follows. In a KC, a disagreement develops between the administrator of the club and the club's instructor as time goes on, ultimately resulting in the instructor\nleaving (division) and founding a new club (independence),\naccompanied by about half the original club's members. This\ngeneric feature of division and independence can be observed\nin many other social communities such as schools, companies,\nchurches, clubs, parties, etc. For example, in the coauthorship\nnetwork, a graduate student publishes papers with her/his thesis advisor, so that they are connected in a coauthorship network. When she/he graduates and becomes a professor in another school (division), she/he also get her/his own students,\ncreating a new group (independence).\nTo model the evolution of the KC network, we modify the\nBA model by assigning a color to each vertex. The color assigned to each vertex indicates the group the vertex belongs\nto. The dynamic rule of our model is as follows:\n(i) BA model (Growth and PA) : Initially, there exist m0\nvertices. They are fully connected. Each vertex i is assigned\nthe same index of color \u03bci = 1. Thus the total number of\ndistinct colors q = 1. At each time step, a vertex is introduced and connects to m existing vertices following the PA\nrule. Here m is not fixed, but is distributed uniformly among\nintegers in the range [1, m0 ]. The new vertex j is also assigned\nthe index of color \u03bcj = 1 and this process is repeated until the\nnumber of vertices reaches n, a cutoff of the group size. This\nprocess defines the first group q = 1.\n(ii) Division and independence : Then we identify the two\nvertices i and j among the group q with the largest and the\nsecond largest degree, respectively, for division and independence. Then the vertex j declares independence and changes\nits color to a new one, i.e., \u03bcj = q + 1. Then, each remaining\nvertex k(6= i, j) in the group having the same color as vertex i\nmeasures the distances d(k, i) and d(k, j) to the vertices i and\nj, respectively. If d(k, i) \u2264 d(k, j), then the vertex k keeps\nthe index of color as it is, otherwise, it changes its index of\ncolor to that of j. Then the system comprises of q + 1 different groups, and then q + 1 \u2192 q, by definition. So the newest\ngroup has the new color q.\n(iii) Growth and PA again : If q > 1, then a newly added\nvertex l chooses one of q colors, say \u03bcl , with equal probability, and m, the number of outgoing links, also randomly from\nthe integers 1, . . . , m0 . Then m existing vertices are chosen in\nthe group with the color \u03bcl following the PA rule, and m edges\nare inserted between them and the new node. This process is\nrepeated until the number of vertices of any group reaches n\nagain. After then, we repeat the step of division and indepen-\n\ndence (ii) in that group only.\nThe network constructed in this way is shown in FIG. 1\nbased on the same number of vertices as the empirical data of\nthe KC network. The structure of the model is different from\nthe BA model due to the presence of modular structure. Note\nthat in our model, one vertex may transfer from one group to\nanother as time goes on, that is, a vertex can change its color as\nit transfers to a new group. This characteristic is different from\nthat of the q-component static model proposed by the current\nauthors [17], where each individual belongs concurrently to q\ndifferent groups such as high school alumni, college alumni,\ncompany, etc. Those two models may reflect different aspects\nof our social community.\nBased on the empirical data by Zachary, we obtain topological properties of the KC network, which are listed in TABLE\n1 and FIG. 2. Until now, it has been believed that social networks are generally assortative [13, 18]. But, in \"division\nand independence\" social networks such as the KC network,\neach element is connected to the others in a hierarchical way,\nwithout any mediator, leading to a dissortative network, as\nshown in TABLE 1 and FIG. 2. Since different colors represent distinct modules [7, 11] or communities [9], connections\nare very tight. Thus it is expected that the clustering coefficient C is non-trivially large [18]. TABLE I shows the dissortativity and the highly-clustered nature of the KC network\nand our model. Agreements between the two are excellent except for the mixing coefficient r. Note that the r value of the\nmodel is not close to zero although we used the BA-type random attachment rule. It should be noted that the large value\nof C is obtained in a self-organized way. FIG. 2 shows that\nthe degree distribution, P (k) \u223c k \u22122.7 , the hierarchical clustering coefficient, C(k) \u223c k \u22121.0 , and hknn i(k) \u223c k \u22120.5 of\nthe KC network, which are also in good agreement with those\nobtained from the present model network. Such agreements\nindicate that our simple model captures the essential topology\nof the KC network.\nMore generally, we investigated the topological properties\nof our model network for large N with various n. In FIG. 3,\nwe consider the case of N = 10000, m0 = 4, and n = 500.\nFIG. 3(a) shows the degree distribution of our model. It seems\nthat P (k) follows a power law with the exponent \u03b3 \u2248 3.5, but\nthat there exists plateau behavior for large k. The plateau for\nlarge k is caused by the artificially uniform cutoff of the group\nName\nZachary's\nOurs\n\nN\n34\n34\n\nhki\n4.59\n4.61\n\nd\n2.41\n2.54\n\nr\n-0.48\n-0.19 (-0.22)\n\nC\n0.59\n0.56\n\nTABLE I: Mean degree hki, the diameter d, the assortativity coefficient r, and the clustering coefficient C obtained from Zachary's\nKC network and from ours with parameter N = 34, m0 = 4 and\nn = 17.

The model\nevolves with time under the principle of division and independence, in a manner reminiscent of the KC network. Through\nthis model, we confirmed the behavior of the hierarchical clustering coefficient, which is in accordance with the ones obtained from the deterministic hierarchical structure and the\nempirical data such as the Internet, the WWW, and the actor\nnetworks [11]. Also it was found that our model exhibits an\ndissortative mixing behavior as observed in the KC network.\nOur model can be modified in various ways, for example, diversifying the group size cutoff n, to fit real world networks.\nFinally, we suggest that the principle of division and independence could be used in constructing modular complex networks in various fields, for example, bio-complex networks,\nwhere the strong mutation of a gene may correspond to transferring from one group to another [19].\n\n10\n\n\u03b2 =1.0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nk\nFIG. 5: The clustering coefficient C(k) versus degree k obtained\nunder two selected conditions with large values of m0 .\n\ntonomous system (FIG. 3(d) of Ref. [11]). For n = 1000,\nmost of the data points for C(k) are scattered more diversely\nwith k, which is similar to the results from the World Wide\nWeb (WWW) (FIG. 3(c) of Ref. [11]). When the group size\nn approaches the network size N , C(k) of our model reduces\nto that of the BA model (FIG. 2(b) of Ref. [11]).\nFIG. 5 shows the m0 -dependence of the hierarchical clustering coefficient C(k). For large m0 values, we can see\nclearly that C(k) has both a plateau regime from k = 2 to\nk \u2243 m0 and a power law regime satisfying C(k) \u223c k \u22121.0\nbeyond that degree. When m0 approaches the group size n,\nsuch as when m0 = 15 and n = 20, i.e., when vertices inside one module are nearly fully-connected, such a plateau\nwith a C value near 1.0 appears. We can thus say that the actor and language networks (FIG. 3(a) and 3(b) of Ref. [11])\nhave modules composed of nearly fully-connected vertices.\nOur model can thus explain most of the hierarchical clustering structures of real world networks qualitatively well, when\nthe two parameters m0 and n are properly selected.
