Barbosa\u2217, Eric Corndorf, Prem Kumar, and Horace P. Yuen\nCenter for Photonic Communication and Computing,\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208\n(Dated: Revised version: 04/17/03.)\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0212018v2 21 Apr 2003\n\nWe demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that secure communication using intermediateenergy (mesoscopic) coherent states is possible. Our scheme is different from previous quantum\ncryptographic schemes in that a short secret key is explicitly used and in which quantum noise hides\nboth the bit and the key. This encryption scheme can be optically amplified. New avenues are open\nto secure communications at high speeds in fiber-optic or free-space channels.\n\nFor the encryption of data with perfect secrecy [1] that\ncannot be broken with any advance in technology, one\nmay in principle employ one-time pad with secret key\nobtained by the BB84 [2] quantum cryptographic technique for key expansion. Such an approach is possible [3],\nhowever, it is slow and inefficient because the key length\nneeds to be as long as the data, and it also requires a\nnearly ideal quantum communication line that is difficult to obtain in long distance commercial systems such\nas the Internet core. On the other hand, for both military\nand commercial applications, there are great demands for\nsecret communications that are fast and secure but not\nnecessarily perfectly secure. (There are many practical\nissues, human as well machine based, that would make\ntheoretical perfect security in specific models not so important in real life [4]). In the following, a new scheme\nbased on ideas similar to those of Ref. [5] is described for\nsecure data encryption that can be operated at optical\nspeeds with conventional optical technology, and a prototype experimental implementation is presented. In this\nscheme, a short secret key is classically extended and then\nused to encrypt data in a way that the quantum noise of\nthe coherent states protects both the data and the key.\nThe following line of reasoning describes the ideas [6]\nthat led to the development of our present kind of quantum cryptographic schemes. One crucial element for obtaining security in BB84 involves the detection of small\nintrusion on weak signals, which is difficult to achieve in\na network environment. This problem would be alleviated if quantum signal sets of higher energy are selected\nfor different bit values by a secret key shared between\nthe sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob). It is important to remember that some shared secret key is needed\nin BB84 for message authentication during protocol execution. The resulting scheme is acceptable as key expansion if the new key is secure even if the shared secret key\nis known to the attacker after the user communications\nare completed. When a secret key is used to identify\nthe signal set, it would be a secret CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) scheme classically, which does not\nallow key expansion because the user and the attacker\nhave the same observation. We would discuss elsewhere\nhow a corresponding KCQ (Keyed CDMA in Quantum\nNoise) scheme can be used to obtain key expansion in the\n\nquantum case. In this paper, we are concerned with the\nuse of KCQ for data encryption.\nThere are two basic problems with classical encryption that does not employ the inefficient one-time pads.\nOne is that the total data uncertainty H(X) given observation Y is bounded above by the key uncertainty,\nH(X) \u2264 H(K) [1]. The other is that the key K may\nbe found by a known-plaintext attack when the eavesdropper (Eve) knows the output-input pairs (Y, X) for\nsome data length. In our scheme, H(X) is not bounded\nby H(K) because Eve cannot have the observation Y\nthat Bob obtained via the optimal quantum measurement\nutilizing the key K. To extract information from even\na full copy of the quantum signal without knowing K,\nEve has to make a sub-optimal measurement that would\nyield information on all possible signal sets for the purpose of either estimating X or finding K from a knownplaintext attack. As a result, Bob has a better channel/observation than Eve. Also, in contrast to classical\ncryptography, one can prove the security of our scheme\nagainst ciphertext-only attacks, although only individual\nattacks are described in this paper. One can show that, in\na properly designed system, even an exponentially powerful search with known-plaintext attacks cannot succeed\nbecause Eve does not have Y as above. Practically, our\nscheme can run at high speeds because there is no need\nfor a long key K.\nConsider the following scheme in which each data bit is\nencoded into a coherent state of an infinite-dimensional\nspace, referred to as a \"qumode\". As in [5], there are M\npossible states\n|\u03b10 (cos \u03b8l + i sin \u03b8l )i, \u03b8l = 2\u03c0l/M\n\n(1)\n\nfor a real \u03b10 and l \u2208 {0, * * * , M \u2212 1}, forming M/2 pairs\n{l, l + M/2}. A seed key K is used to drive an encryption mechanism whose output is a much longer running\nkey K\u2032 that is used to determine, for each qumode carrying bit b (= 0, 1), which pair of signals (signal set) is to\nbe used. Each pair may be macroscopically distinguishable since the inner product of any two basis states is\nexp(\u22122|\u03b10 |2 ). For large M , a lower bound on the obtained mean-square error (\u03b4\u03b8)2 [7] that goes as 1/|\u03b10 |2\nshows that asymptotically when M \u226b |\u03b10 | the attacker's\nerror probability PeE tends to 1/2, the guessing level, in\n\n\f2\nE\n\nPe\n0.5\n0.4\n\n1 10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\nM\n20\n\nFIG. 1:\n\nPeE\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n2\n\nas a function of M for |\u03b1| = 1, 10, 100, 1000.\n\nan individual attack on the data bit b. That this result\nholds in the limit M \u2192 \u221e for fixed |\u03b10 | is intuitively\nobvious. A two-mode coherent-state realization similar\nto Eq. (1), with |\u03b10 cos \u03b8l i|\u03b10 sin \u03b8l i, can also be used\nand the modes can be interpreted as ones of polarization, time, frequency, or whatever.\nNumerical calculation of the optimal POVM for individual attack on bit discrimination for the M -ry case has\nshown [8] that the minimum probability of error PeE for\nan eavesdropper can be made arbitrarily close to 1/2 for a\ngiven coherent-state amplitude \u03b1. The value PeE \u2192 1/2\nfor a fixed average number of photons |\u03b1|2 is achieved\nby increasing the number of levels M . As shown in Figure 1, PeE goes very fast to the asymptotic pure-guessing\nlimit of 1/2 as M increases. The above POVM calculation demonstrates that in this scheme an eavesdropper cannot obtain the bits sent regardless of the precision of her devices. The optimal POVM gives the maximum amount of information she could obtain from the\nsequence of physical signals sent without knowing the\nkey. This uncertainty is due to the quantum noise of\nlight and cannot be overcome with one's precision capabilities. Bob, on the other hand, by knowing the key\ncan extract information with greater precision. His decision has to be made only between two nearly orthogonal\n\u2032\nstates in the same basis defined\n\u0011 prob\u0010 by\u221aa given K . His\n1\nB\nability of error is [9] Pe = 2 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 e\u22122T |\u03b1|2 , where\nT is the transmissivity of the channel. For large values\nof |\u03b1| the minimum probability of error PeB is negligible,\nwhich makes possible an excellent signal recovery by the\nlegitimate receiver. The case of collective attacks is more\ncomplicated and cannot be discussed here, in large part\nbecause there is no meaningful approach for evaluating\nthe optimal bit error, even in the classical case. However,\nthe entropy bound (Holevo's theorem) could be used to\nshow the ideal nature of this scheme for the criterion of\ndata entropy.\nThe attacker can also try to find the key K based\non her copy of the quantum signals, with or without\nsome known-plaintext (data) corresponding to the signals. Even in a known-plaintext attack, the signal quantum fluctuation would yield, from the number of possibil-\n\nFIG. 2: Left side: Basic ciphering scheme with qumodes of\npolarization. Right side: Two neighboring bases in an Mry manifold on a great circle of Poincar\u00e9's sphere. Bits 0\nand 1 are antipodals for each basis. Closest states (similar\npolarization ellipses) represent opposite bit values.\n\nities in each qumode, an exponential number of possible\nK\u2032 in a sequence of data bits. To identify K from such\nnoisy observations of possible K\u2032 would involve an exponential search, which can always be launched against a\nkey in known-plaintext attacks but which is currently believed to be proven impossible computationally even with\na quantum computer. Note that the attacker has a much\nmore difficult job of estimating the signal pair from M/2\npossible ones, than the user who tries to discriminate 2\npossible known states. A detailed quantitative treatment\nwould be given elsewhere. It is important to note that, in\nthe case of classical cryptography, if the running key K\u2032\nis used directly as one-time pad on the data, the result\nis well known [10] to be insecure against known-plaintext\nattacks. In our case, this attack is thwarted by quantum\neffects as explained above.\nConsider an implementation of the above scheme as depicted in Fig. 2. This particular type of KCQ scheme will\nbe refered to as \u03b1\u03b7 (for coherent states and efficiency). In\nthe encryption scheme for this new protocol, sketched on\nthe left side in Fig. 2, Alice uses an explicit short secret\nkey K, extended to a longer key K\u2032 by another encryption mechanism such as a stream cipher, to modulate the\nparameters of a multimode coherent state. For the freespace implementation to be presented, the qumodes are\nthe two orthogonal modes of polarization. In this case,\nAlice uses the running key K\u2032 to specify a polarization\nbasis from a set of M/2 uniformly spaced two-mode bases\nspanning a great circle on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, as shown\non the right in Fig. 2. Each basis consists of a polarization state and its antipodal state at an angle \u03c0 from it,\nrepresenting the 0 and 1 bit value for that basis.\nThe message X is encoded as Y(X, K\u2032 ). This mapping\nof the stream of bits onto points on the surface of the\nPoincar\u00e9 sphere is the information to be shared by Alice\n(A) and Bob (B). Because of his knowledge of K\u2032 , Bob is\nable to make a precise demodulation operation, producing the plaintext X. He uses K\u2032 to apply the requisite\npolarization transformation to the received sequence of\npolarization states to return them to the linearly orthog-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Schematic of the experimental setup.

Bob's demodulation is the inverse\nmapping transformation that was utilized by Alice.\nFigure 3 shows a table-top experimental setup we\nhave implemented as a proof-of-principle demonstration of this scheme. The modulation systems utilized\nboth at the transmitter and receiver ends are electrooptic modulators (EOMs)(New Focus, model 4104), the\nlaser (Toshiba, model TOLD9225M) operates at 670nm,\nand the detectors are single photon counting modules\n(Perkin-Elmer, model SPCM-AQR-16) with interference\nfilters of 10nm bandwidth in front. A polarization beam\nsplitter (PBS) is used at the receiver to discriminate between the orthogonal linear polarization states. Lenses\n(L) are used to optimize the beam Rayleigh range within\nthe EOMs. A personal computer containing an interface\ncard (National Instruments, model PCI-6111E) is used\nto control the EOM's (digital-to-analog operation). The\nsame card is also used for counting the output pulses\nfrom the detectors. In this configuration, a horizontally\n(H) or vertically (V) polarized light pulse representing\nbit 0 or 1 is generated and transformed into an elliptically polarized light state by application of the voltage\nVk (k \u2208 K\u2032 ). This voltage introduces a phase difference \u2206\u03c6k between the physical axes of the EOM, where\n\u2206\u03c6k = \u03c02 VV\u03c0k + \u03c60 , and V\u03c0 and \u03c60 are specific to each\nmodulator. This system operates, with bulk optics, at\n200kHz rate for demonstration purposes and faster fiber\nbased systems (\u223c1GHz) are being implemented for free\nspace as well as fiber channels.\nFigure 4 shows a sequence of bits as received by Bob.\nThe clear separation of the 0 and 1 histograms allow him\nto make bit decisions with no error. The same sequence\nof bits as seen by Eve are shown in Fig. 5, giving her a\nvery high probability of error (PeE \u223c 1/2) in bit decisions\nbecause of her lacking the key.\nAs an illustration of how the quantum noise of light\ncan be utilized by the legitimate receiver on his behalf,\nin Fig. 6 we show the uncertainty in the polarization an-\n\nFIG. 4: Difference of V and H counts (V\u2212H) from Bob's\nreceiver operating at 200kHz, with the average number of received photons hni = |\u03b1|2 = 27 and M = 50.

The corresponding histogram on the right shows that distinct bits are not\ndistinguishable by her.\n\ngle produced by a two-mode measurement for an average\ntotal photon number hni \u2243 38. Regions of low-variance\nvalues are seen around 0 and \u03c0/2 settings of the input\npolarization state [cf. Fig. 6(c)]. Such determination of\nthe polarization angle with angle-dependent uncertainty\nshows that a higher degree of precision in angle determination can be achieved by an observer with a prior information on how to set the measuring apparatus than another who does not have this knowledge. From Fig. 6(c)\none can observe that for PBS-axis orientations close to\nthe incoming field polarization direction the uncertainty\nin determination of the angle is small.pThe polarization\nangle is obtained by averaging arctan nV /nH over the\noccurrence of nH and nV , the photon numbers reaching\nthe detectors [cf. Fig. 6(b)]. The\np approximation that \u03b8\ncan be obtained through arctan nV /nH is adequate for\nmesoscopic signals but becomes inadequate as hni \u2192 0\n(quantum phase domain). Setting PBS without knowledge of this preferred orientation leads, in average, to a\nlarger error in determination of the polarization angle.\nOn the other hand, an observer setting his analyzer system close to the field polarization direction (0 or \u03c0/2) is\n\n\f4\n(selected from M = 200 possible positions with N\u03c3 \u2243 6,\nand correctly recovered by Bob with the use of the\nkey) while the second number is the basis extracted\nby Eve through a single measurement of nH and nV .\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Measurement of the polarization angle through\ntwo-mode direct detection with use of a PBS. A \u03bb/2 waveplate\nis rotated to produce different polarization angles \u03c6. (b) Uncertainties in \u03c6, \u2206\u03c6, arise owing to photon-number fluctuations around hnH i and hnV i, where nH and nV are the photon\nnumbers sampled by the two detectors (hnH nV i = hnH ihnV i).\n(c) Variance in the angle \u03c6 obtained via the two-mode measurement versus the angle set by the \u03bb/2 plate. Solid line is\nthe theoretical prediction, not a fit, without considering the\ndetector noises (mainly \"dark\" and Johnson noises), which\nwill set the ultimate precision limit in these measurements.\n\nFIG. 7: Number of bases N\u03c3 covered by the quantum noise\nas a function of the number of photons hni = |\u03b1|2 . For a\ngiven hni, Alice repeatedly sets every basis, separated by \u03c0/M\n(M = 500), one by one, by applying a voltage to the EOM.\nBy measuring nH and nV , Eve performs an angle reconstruction in an attempt to identify the basis used. Eve's standard\ndeviation around the basis sent by Alice gives N\u03c3 . Line is the\ntheory.\n\nonly limited by the optical precision of the analyzer used\n(which can be made arbitrarily small), and the noise in\nthe detectors.\nThe cryptography system should be designed so that\nthe uncertainties caused by the quantum noise of light in\nthe measurement of the polarization angles is large. It\ncan be shown that the number of bases N\u03c3 within a standard deviation of the measured angle is N\u03c3 = M/(\u03c0|\u03b1|).\nFig. 7 shows experimental results that confirm this dependence.\nThe effect of noise on signal recovery by an eavesdropper in an opaque attack can be simulated by sending\nrepeatedly the same bit, but varying K\u2032 , from A to\nB when B (playing Eve) does not apply the key to\ndemodulate the signals. In the following sequence S,\nthe first number in a brace is the basis set by Alice\n\nS = {110, 117}, {84, 78}, {108, 99}, {90, 91}, {100, 107},\n{102, 97}, {84, 84}, {110, 105}, {110, 111}, {114, 105}, {82, 86},\n{100, 95}, {92, 72}, {108, 108}, {102, 90}, {108, 97}, {96, 93},\n{110, 103}, {112, 121}, {86, 86}, {102, 100}, {88, 91}, {102, 94},\n{106, 98}, {118, 135}. Clearly, Eve makes a large number\n\nof errors in determining the transmitted bases.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that under individual attacks Yuen's encryption protocol is secure with\nan adequate number of bases M and without the need for\nintrusion detection. Key expansion is also possible under this scheme, due to the better observation available to\nBob with knowledge of the key. Significantly, the encryption system allows for signal amplification as long as the\nsecurity is guaranteed at the source for the following reason. While Eve has to resolve M levels to tell the bit or\nK\u2032 without knowing the key, Bob has to resolve only two\nlevels with the key. Thus, amplifier noise would hinder\nEve's attack while it will not disrupt Bob's decryption.\nFurthermore, there is no need to decrypt/re-encrypt at\nthe nodes of a properly designed communication line with\na moderate number of amplifiers.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 This work is supported by the\nDARPA grant F30602-01-2-0528.
