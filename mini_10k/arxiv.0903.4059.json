Phys. A: Math. Theor.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Ramanujan's work and subsequent studies on the q-special functions certainly\nrepresent an important chapter within several astonishing achievements reached along\nthe last decades in mathematics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Another particular but\nnot least remarkable research branch developed in parallel by mathematicians and\nphysicists is focussed on quantum groups and/or q-deformed algebras [11, 12]. Since\nq-deformed algebras encompass the description of a wide variety of symmetries, if\none compares with those studied in the standard Lie algebras, it turned natural to\nemploy this powerful mathematical tool to investigate certain complex symmetries\nassociated with nontrivial physical systems in an appropriate way. Hence, several\ncontributions have appeared in the literature, from time to time, presenting a plethora\nof original results directly related to specific problems originated from solvable\nstatistical mechanics models [13], quantum inverse scattering theory [14], nuclear\nphysics [15, 16], molecular physics [17], some q-deformed extensions of quantum\nmechanics [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and quantum optics with emphasis on coherent states\n[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], as well as recent applications in trapped ions by laser\nfields [31] and also in the Jaynes-Cummings model [32]. Furthermore, it is worth\nmentioning that this range of possible applications can also be extended to deformed\nsuperalgebras [33], knot theories [34] and non-commutative geometries [35].\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n2\n\nIn this prominent scenario, there are approaches that connect q-special functions\nand q-deformed algebras which deserve be placed in evidence because they exhibit\na unifying quantum-algebraic framework for the realizations and/or representations\nof those algebras. For example, within the context of Lie algebras and their qanalogues, Feinsilver [36] has discussed how the three-term recurrence relations related\nto orthogonal polynomials can be used to obtain certain realizations in terms of raising\nand lowering operators. Floreanini and Vinet [37] showed that suitable operators\nacting on vector spaces of functions in one complex variable can be considered as\npossible realizations of the slq (2) and q-oscillator algebras. Pursuing this formal line\nof theoretical investigation, some few authors [38, 39, 40] also presented significant\ncontributions for a special class of orthogonal polynomials, which are recognized in\nthe literature as Rogers-Szeg\u00f6 (RS) and Stieltjes-Wigert (SW) polynomials [41, 42, 43].\nThe mathematical motivation for this specific choice of polynomials is directly\nassociated with the q-oscillator algebra, namely, both the polynomials are viewed as\nconcrete representations of the Iwata-Arik-Coon-Kuryshkin (IACK) algebra [20], and\ntheir respective realizations expressed by means of the Jackson's q-derivative [44, 45].\nIn addition, while the SW polynomials are orthogonalized on the full real line, the\nRS polynomials are defined upon the complex plane and orthogonalized on the unit\ncircle through a particular measure [40, 43]. This fundamental feature intrinsic to the\nRS polynomials has a potential connection with angular representations in quantum\nmechanics, such fact being interpreted by us as an effective gain in what concerns\nthe debate on the polar decomposition of the annihilation operator in quantum optics\n[46, 47, 48, 49, 50].\nThe main goal of this paper is to present a consistent algebraic framework\nbased on a particular set of q-special functions which leads us to go further in our\ncomprehension on the phase operator problem and its different representations in\nquantum mechanics. For this purpose, we first review certain essential mathematical\nproperties associated with the RS polynomials which permit us to establish two new\n(as far as we know) integral representations for such polynomials involving the finite\nq-Pochhammer symbol and the SW polynomials. In the following, we define our object\nof study (here named as RS functions) through a product of two complex functions\nwith distinct essential features, namely \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) := Rn (z; q)M (z; q). Indeed, while\nthe first one is a RS polynomial (at least of the normalization coefficient), the second\none is responsible for the corresponding weight function which is connected with the\ndecomposition of the Szeg\u00f6 measure in the complex plane. An immediate consequence\nfrom this peculiar sort of definition refers to its inherent orthogonality property, that\nis, it preserves the orthogonality relation verified for the RS polynomials. Another\nimportant property concerns the completeness relation for the RS functions that is\npresented in this context via a bilinear kernel [38]. The q-calculus framework is then\nemployed to carry out a careful analysis of each aforementioned complex function,\nand the results originated from this analysis used to derive the q-differential forms of\nthe lowering, raising and number operators. It is worth stressing that the algebraic\napproach here developed for the RS functions leads us to obtain, in principle, not only\nan alternative representation for the IACK algebra but also an inherent realization.\nThe second part of this paper is focussed basically on the construction process\nof coherent and phase states in accordance with the quantum-algebraic framework\npreviously discussed. So, our first application has as reference guide the mathematical\napproach developed in [51] for an important class of coherent states, namely, those\nobtained from a determined eigenvalue equation for a given annihilation operator\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n3\n\n[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The eigenfunctions derived from this particular\nprocedure are then expressed as an infinite expansion in terms of the RS functions\nwhose coefficients satisfy a set of mathematical prerequesites that leads us to obtain,\nas a by-product, the excitation probability distribution for the q-deformed coherent\nstate. Expressing in a clearer way, once the physical system of interest can be initially\nprepared in the q-deformed coherent state, this result allows us to obtain the excitation\nprobability distribution (here labelled by the degree of excitation n of the q-deformed\nharmonic oscillator) for such system. Furthermore, we discuss in details some intrinsic\nproperties of this definition. In what concerns the phase states and their connections\nwith the angular representations in quantum mechanics, we have constructed the qdeformed eigenstates for the cosine and sine operators following the Carruthers-Nieto\napproach [47], and also presented the orthogonality and completeness relations for each\nsituation. To complete this work, we have applied our results in order to calculate, via\nq-deformed coherent states, certain mean values associated with the cosine and sine\noperators which allow us to carry out a detailed study on the Robertson-Schr\u00f6dinger\nand symmetrical uncertainty relations.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we establish some few essential\nmathematical properties and also derive two additional integral representations for the\nRS polynomials. In section 3 we introduce the RS functions {\u03a8RS\nn (z; q)}n\u2208N through\nthe product of two basic complex functions whose distinct characteristics lead us to\nobtain a wide set of results which constitutes our quantum-algebraic framework. In\nthe following, section 4 is dedicated to the construction process of q-deformed coherent\nstates related to the RS functions, where certain properties (for instance, the overlap\nprobability and completeness relation) are discussed in details. Moreover, we obtain in\nsection 5 the respective eigenstates of the cosine and sine operators, as well as present\nsome relevant results for each situation. The discussion on the Robertson-Schr\u00f6dinger\nand symmetrical uncertainty relations involving such operators is presented in section\n6. Finally, section 7 contains our summary and conclusions.\n2. Explanatory notes on the RS polynomials\nIn order to make the presentation of this section more self-contained, let us initially\nreview certain essential mathematical prerequisites of the RS polynomials, for then\nestablishing, subsequently, two integral representations which permit to connect such\npolynomials with the finite q-Pochhammer symbol and the SW polynomials. It is\nimportant to emphasize that the basic notation employed in our exposition follows\nsome well-known textbooks on special functions, where, in particular, the q-series or\nEulerian series are introduced within the context of theory of partitions and/or basic\nhypergeometric series [7, 8, 9, 10].\nDefinition. Let {Hn (z; q)}n\u2208N designate a set of polynomials with 0 < q < 1 and\nz \u2208 C. In particular, the RS polynomials are defined through of the finite series [41, 42]\n\u0015\nn \u0014\nX\nn\nHn (z; q) :=\nzk,\n(1)\nk q\nk=0\n\nwhere the q-binomial coefficients (also known as Gaussian polynomials)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n[n]q !\n(q; q)n\nn\n:=\n=\nk q\n(q; q)k (q; q)n\u2212k\n[k]q ![n \u2212 k]q !\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n4\n\nare expressed in terms of the finite q-Pochhammer symbol\n(a; q)n :=\n\nn\u22121\nY\nj=0\n\n(1 \u2212 aq j )\n\n(a \u2208 C)\n\nor written as a function of the q-factorial [n]q ! := (1 \u2212 q)\u2212n (q; q)n .\nIt is worth noticing that the generating function associated with Hn (z; q) is given\n\u22121\nby the specific Eulerian series G(w, z; q) := [(w; q)\u221e (wz; q)\u221e ] for |wz| < 1. Thus,\nfor future use in the text, in order to establish a consistent proof of this statement,\nlet us first consider the particular case G(w, 0; q) = [(w; q)\u221e ]\u22121 . In this situation, the\nCauchy theorem states that, for |w| < 1 and 0 < q < 1, G(w, 0; q) is reduced to the\ninfinite series [7]\nX wn\nG(w, 0; q) =\n(w \u2208 C).\n(q; q)n\nn\u2208N\n\nThis result leads us to propose that G(w, z; q) admits a similar expression, where now\nthe summand is multiplied by the coefficient An (z; q),\nX\nwn\nG(w, z; q) =\nAn (z; q)\n.\n(2)\n(q; q)n\nn\u2208N\n\nIndeed, equation (2) has the essential features that we need for our purposes since\nthe infinite product G(w, z; q) is uniformly convergent for all q inside |wz| \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b5,\nand therefore it defines a function of w and z analytic in |wz| < 1. Furthermore, the\nidentity [43]\nG(qw, z; q) = (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 qw)G(w, z; q)\n\nallows us to show that {An (z; q)}n\u2208N satisfies a three-term recurrence relation\nAn+1 (z; q) = (1 + z)An (z; q) \u2212 (1 \u2212 q n )zAn\u22121 (z; q),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A0 (z; q) = 1 and A1 (z; q) = 1 + z. The remaining terms for n \u2265 2 determine\na set of polynomials expressed explicitly in terms of z and q, whose closed formula\ncoincides exactly with equation (1); consequently, An (z; q) \u2261 Hn (z; q). \u2752\nNext, let us introduce some few properties related to the RS polynomials where\nspecial attention will be paid to their orthogonality property. Adopting a particular\nparametrization for the complex variable z, Szeg\u00f6 [42] showed that {Hn (z; q)}n\u2208N can\nbe orthogonalized on the circle through a specific measure which coincides with the\nJacobi \u03b83 -function evaluated at continuous arguments [52], that is,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nZ \u03c0\n1\n1\n\u03c6 1 d\u03c6\n(q; q)n\nq2\n\u03b4m,n .\n(4)\n=\nHm \u2212q \u2212 2 e\u2212i\u03c6 ; q Hn \u2212q \u2212 2 ei\u03c6 ; q \u03b83\n2\n2\u03c0\nqn\n\u2212\u03c0\nSubsequently, Carlitz [43] generalized such equation by fixing the integration measure\nand considering different arguments of Hn (z; q). Since then, different authors have\nworked on this theme and showed some interesting peculiarities of the RS polynomials.\nFor example, Macfarlane [18] has discussed the quantum group SUq (2) through a\nmathematical procedure that resembles the approach developed by Schwinger [53]\nfor the quantum theory of angular momentum. In particular, the author showed\nhow the coordinate representation of the q-deformed harmonic oscillator can be used\nin order to obtain a wavefunction which is expressed in terms of RS polynomials.\nMoreover, Atakishiyev and Nagiyev [38] derived an important orthogonality relation\non the full real line for such polynomials, and also established a special link with the\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n5\n\nSW polynomials by means of a Fourier transform. Recently, Galetti and coworkers\n[40] have shown didactically both the orthogonality relations for the RS and SW\npolynomials, as well as obtained the explicit realizations of the raising and lowering\noperators for each case;\u2021 in addition, the authors also proposed a Wigner function\nrelated to the RS polynomials which leads us to determine a set of well-behaved\nmarginal distribution functions with compact support for the angle and action\nvariables.\nThe next property to be discussed allows us to establish a connection between\nthe finite q-Pochhammer symbol and the RS polynomials. For this task let us initially\nexpress, by means of the Cauchy theorem, (a; q)n as a sum involving finite powers of\nthe complex variable a, namely\n\u0015\nn \u0014\nX\n1\nn\n(a; q)n =\nq 2 k(k\u22121) (\u2212a)k .\nk q\nk=0\n\nThis result is extremely important in our considerations since it leads us to verify that\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u03c0\n2u2\n1\nd\u03c6\n= (ar ; q)n ,\n(5)\nHn \u2212q \u2212 2 ar eis\u03c6 ; q \u03b83 u\u03c6 q s2\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\ns\nis an integer number - note that the rightwhere r is an arbitrary power of a and 2u\nhand side of equation (5) does not depend on s and u in this situation. Thus, if one\nsubstitutes r = 1 in such case, this identity can be considered as a possible integral\nrepresentation for the finite q-Pochhammer symbol. Another interesting additional\nproperty consists in establishing an integral representation for the RS polynomials\nthrough an adequate transformation kernel Pr (\u03c9; q), that is,\nZ \u221e\n(\u2212q r z\u03c9; q)n Pr (\u03c9; q) d\u03c9 = Hn (z; q)\n(6)\n0\n\nwith\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u00012\n1\nm r\u2212 3\n2\n2\n1\nr \u2212 2 \u2212 m ln (\u03c9)\nPr (\u03c9; q) := \u221a \u03c9 2 exp \u2212\n(m \u2208 R)\n\u03c0\n4m2\n\u0001\n1\nand q = exp \u2212 2m\n2 . In order to demonstrate such equation, it is sufficient to know\nthat\nZ \u221e\n1\n(7)\n\u03c9 k Pr (\u03c9; q) d\u03c9 = q \u2212 2 k(k\u22121)\u2212rk\n0\n\u0001\nfor the following proper parametrization: \u03c9 = exp mx2 (\u2212\u221e < x < \u221e). It is worth\nnoticing that Pr (\u03c9; q) not only encompasses certain particular cases studied by Carlitz\n[43], but also can be used to orthogonalize the SW polynomials.\nLet us derive now a last integral representation for the RS polynomials which has,\nas an integrand, the product of the SW polynomials\n\u0015\nn \u0014\nX\n\u0001k\nn\nn+r\nGn (q\nz\u03c9; q) :=\n(8)\nq k(k\u2212n) q n+r z\u03c9\nk q\nk=0\n\nand the transformation kernel\n\u0015\n\u0014\nr\nm2 2\nm\nr2\n\u22121\n2\n\u2212\nln (\u03c9) .\nYr (\u03c9; q) := \u221a \u03c9\nexp \u2212\n8m2\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u2021 It is worth mentioning that Ismail and Rahman [39] slightly modified the argument of Hn (z; q)\n(namely, z \u2192 q \u22121/2 z) with the aim of deriving the respective q-differential forms related to the\nraising and lowering operators. This particular procedure has then produced certain ladder operators\nfor the RS polynomials whose formal expressions differ from those obtained in [40].\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n6\n\nIn this situation, if one considers the parametrizations used in the previous case for q\nand \u03c9, it is easy to show that\nZ \u221e\n\u03c9 k Yr (\u03c9; q) d\u03c9 = q \u2212k(k+r) ,\n(9)\n0\n\nwhich leads us to validate the integral representation\nZ \u221e\nGn (q n+r z\u03c9; q)Yr (\u03c9; q) d\u03c9 = Hn (z; q).\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\nIn such a case, contrasting with the relation Gn (z; q) = Hn (z; q \u22121 ), the transformation\nkernel Yr (\u03c9; q) permits us to identify a new link between the SW and RS polynomials\nthrough the integral representation (10). Note that equations (6) and (10) represent,\nin particular, two new additional results within a wide variety of formal properties\nobtained by Carlitz [43] for {Hn (z; q)}n\u2208N . Next, we will investigate a special family of\nq-orthogonalized functions (here named as the RS functions) with the aim of obtaining\na set of mathematical properties which leads us to formally characterize its associated\nalgebraic structure.\n3. Algebraic properties of the RS functions\nIn this section we establish some preliminary mathematical results inherent to the RS\nfunctions. As a first step, we obtain a decomposition formula for the Szeg\u00f6 measure\nin the complex plane which leads us to define a weight function E (\u03c6; q) related to\nour object of study. In the following step, we construct explicitly the realizations of\nraising and lowering operators for such functions by means of a specific definition of the\nJackson's q-derivative, as well as discuss the implications of this algebraic approach.\n3.1.

Figure 1 shows the plots of the equipotential curves\nrelated to (a) Re [E (\u03c6; q)] and (b) Im [E (\u03c6; q)] for the variables \u03c6 and q within the\nintervals [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] and (0, 1), respectively.

The different patterns observed in both pictures are directly related to\nthe distinct behaviours of the Jacobi \u03b83 - and \u03b81 -functions used to decompose the\nSzeg\u00f6 measure in the product E (\u03c6; q)E \u2217 (\u03c6; q).\n\npeak at the point \u03c6 = 0 and q \u2192 1, this behaviour being the same of that observed\nin our numerical investigations for the equipotential curves associated with the Szeg\u00f6\nmeasure. In counterpart, plot (b) has two symmetric peaks located at the points\n\u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 and q \u2192 0, such distinct behaviour being now explained due to the presence\nof the Jacobi \u03b81 -function in equation (12). Consequently, the product E (\u03c6; q)E \u2217 (\u03c6; q)\nnot only retains the pattern verified in plot (a) but also confirms an important property\nfor this integration measure, that is, its decomposition into the complex plane.

Among them, let us focus on two basic rules which have an important\nrole in our calculations, that is, the sum rule\nDq2 \u03c6(z; q) :=\n\nDq2 [\u03c61 (z; q) + \u03c62 (z; q)] = Dq2 \u03c61 (z; q) + Dq2 \u03c62 (z; q)\nand the q-version of the Leibnitz rule\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nDq2 [\u03c61 (z; q)\u03c62 (z; q)] = Dq2 \u03c61 (z; q) \u03c62 (z; q) + \u03c61 (q 2 z; q) Dq2 \u03c62 (z; q)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= Dq2 \u03c61 (z; q) \u03c62 (q 2 z; q) + \u03c61 (z; q) Dq2 \u03c62 (z; q) .\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nAs a first task, let us determine the action of the q-differential operator Dq2 on\nthe polynomial Rn (z; q), that is,\n\u00131\n\u0012\n2 1 \u2212 qz\nq\nq\nDq2 Rn (z; q) =\n[n]q Rn (z; q) +\n[n]1/2\n(24)\nq Rn\u22121 (z; q)\n1+q\n1\u2212q\n1+q\nwhere [n]q := 1\u2212q\n1\u2212q stands for the q-number [44, 45].

For instance,\nGelfand and coworkers [6] have proposed a two-parameter q-differential operator Dr,s whose action\non \u03c6(z; q) obeys the mathematical prescription\nDr,s \u03c6(z; q) :=\n\n\u03c6(rz; q) \u2212 \u03c6(sz; q)\n.\nz(r \u2212 s)\n\nNote that Dq2 represents a particular case of Dr,s since Dq2 \u2261 D1,q2 .\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n12\n\nfor any q \u2208 (0, 1) and n \u2208 N. Note that both identities not only depend on the degrees\nn and n\u22131, but also preserve the phase of the orthogonalized RS functions - this fact\nbeing, in particular, a direct consequence of the scaling relations derived for M (z; q).\nThe comparison of these results leads us to verify that \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) satisfies a three-term\nrecurrence relation exactly equal to that obtained for Rn (z; q).\n3.3. Lowering and raising operators\nAs a last step in our calculations, let us now construct the q-differential representations\nof the lowering and raising operators associated with {\u03a8RS\nn (z; q)}n\u2208N , as well as the\nrespective representation for the q-deformed number operator.

Besides, the energy eigenvalues [20, 29]\n2 \u2212 (1 + q)q n\nE0\n(E0 = ~\u03c90 /2)\nEn =\n1\u2212q\nof this particular q-deformed HO present a nonlinear dependence on n and its energy\nspectrum is not equally spaced, namely\nEn+1 \u2212 En\n\u2206n :=\n= (1 + q)q n .\nE0\nIn principle, such arguments should be sufficient to explain qualitatively the functional\nforms of equations (26) and (27).\nThe second comment is related to the commutation relations (29) and (30), where\nit is clear that both relations are equivalent only in the contraction limit q \u2192 1\u2212\n(in this limit, we recover the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra h4 ); furthermore, analogous\ncommutation relations were also obtained in Ref. [40] for the RS polynomials. As a\nlast remark, let us mention that Floreanini and Vinet [37] have developed a quantumalgebraic framework for a finite set of q-special functions, where the realizations of\nthe underlying algebras are given in terms of operators acting on vector spaces of\ncomplex functions. In this sense, the results here discussed may represent an important\ncontribution to that framework since it allows us to open a new promising chapter on\nthe angular representations in quantum mechanics.\n4. Coherent states\nIn accordance with the algebraic approach developed until now, let us construct in\nthis section a class of Barut-Girardello coherent states [51] related to the RS functions\nwhich are eigenstates of the lowering operator B with eigenvalues \u03bc \u2208 C, that is,\nBF\u03bc (z; q) = \u03bcF\u03bc (z; q).\n(31)\nWithin this context, the complex function F\u03bc (z; q) can be properly expanded in terms\nof the complete set {\u03a8RS\nn (z; q)}n\u2208N as follows [23]:\nX\nF\u03bc (z; q) =\nCn (\u03bc; q)\u03a8RS\n(32)\nn (z; q).\nn\u2208N\n\nThe coefficients {Cn (\u03bc; q)}n\u2208N\u2217 are then determined by means of equation (31), while\nthe coefficient C0 (\u03bc; q) results from the orthogonality relation (16). Consequently,\nsuch mathematical procedure leads us to obtain\n\u0001 \u03bcn\n,\nCn (\u03bc; q) = eq\u22121/2 (1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 p\n[n]q !\nwhere eq (x) := (x; q)\u22121\n\u221e defines a q-exponential function which converges absolutely\nfor q \u2208 (0, 1) and |x| < 1 [9, page 9]. Therefore, if one substitutes these coefficients in\nthe right-hand side of equation (32) and takes into account the identity\nhp\nin\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010p\nq(1 \u2212 q) \u03bc\nX\np\nq(1 \u2212 q) \u03bc, q(1 \u2212 q) \u03bcz; q\n,\n=\nHn (z; q)\n(q; q)n\n\u221e\nn\u2208N\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n14\n\nwhich, as it has been pointed out in section 2, can be promptly attained via equation\n(2), we finally obtain the entire function\n\u0001\n\u22121/2\neq\n(1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 M (z; q)\n\u0010\n\u0011 .\nF\u03bc (z; q) = \u221a\n(33)\np\np\n2\u03c0\nq(1 \u2212 q) \u03bc, q(1 \u2212 q) \u03bcz; q\n\u221e\n\nNote that equations (32) and (33) represent two different forms of expressing F\u03bc (z; q),\nand that |Cn (\u03bc; q)|2 is associated with the excitation probability distribution for the qdeformed coherent state. In the following, let us present at least two inherent algebraic\nproperties of these particular coherent states.\nThe first property is a direct consequence of expansion (33) and corresponds to\nthe formula for the scalar product\nZ \u03c0\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\neq ((1 \u2212 q)\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 )\n(34)\nF\u03bd\u2217 \u2212q \u2212 2 ei\u03c6 ; q F\u03bc \u2212q \u2212 2 ei\u03c6 ; q d\u03c6 =\n1 ,\n\u2212\u03c0\n[eq ((1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 ) eq ((1 \u2212 q)|\u03bd|2 )] 2\nfrom which we can infer the inequality\n\n2\n\n0<\n\n|eq ((1 \u2212 q)\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 )|\n\u2264 1.\neq ((1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 ) eq ((1 \u2212 q)|\u03bd|2 )\n\nNote that this overlap probability is equal to one for \u03bd = \u03bc (normalizability condition\nof the scalar product) and falls to zero when |\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd|2 becomes large in the limit\nq \u2192 1\u2212 ; in other words, the coherent states {F\u03bc (z; q)}\u03bc\u2208C are not orthogonal. Gray\nand Nelson [24] obtained an analogous mathematical result for the scalar product of\ncoherent states associated with the q-deformed HO, whose commutation relations are\ncharacterized by: AA\u2020 \u2212 q \u22121/2 A\u2020 A = q \u2212N/2 , [N, A\u2020 ] = A\u2020 , and [N, A] = \u2212A. Such\nresult is not a mere coincidence since both approaches can be considered as particular\n(\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3)\n(h4 ) [29].\ncases of the generalized q-deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra Uq\nThe next property assures the implicit resolution of unity (or completeness\nrelation) for the coherent states defined by means of the entire function F\u03bc (z; q),\nnamely\nZ\nF\u03bc\u2217 (w; q)F\u03bc (z; q) d2 \u03c3q (\u03bc) = lim K\u03b5 (w, z; q),\n(35)\n\u03b5\u21921\u2212\n\nDq\n\nwhere\nDq =\n\n\u001a\n\nh\n\u03bc = |\u03bc|ei\u03b8 : |\u03bc|2 \u2208 0,\n\n\u001b\n1 \u0011\nand \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)\nq\u22121\n\ncorresponds to the integration domain in the complex plane,\n\u0001\neq (1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 dq (|\u03bc|2 )d\u03b8\n2\nd \u03c3q (\u03bc) =\neq ((1 \u2212 q)q|\u03bc|2 )\n2\u03c0\n\n(36)\n\nits respective measure [26], and K\u03b5 (w, z; q) represents the bilinear kernel (17). To\ndemonstrate this specific identity, we first substitute the expansion (32) into the lefthand side of equation (35) and then carry out, subsequently, the integration over the\nangle variable \u03b8. Such usual procedure permits to reduce the integration over the\ndomain Dq in the Jackson q-integral [23, 45]\nZ 1\nX q k(n+1)\n1\u2212q\n|\u03bc|2n\n1\n2\nIq (n) =\nd\n(|\u03bc|\n)\n=\n.\nq\neq ((1 \u2212 q)q|\u03bc|2 )\n(1 \u2212 q)n\neq (q k+1 )\n0\nk\u2208N\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n15\n\nAs an intermediate stage in our proof,\nconsider\nthe result derived in [9] for\n\u0001 let us nowk+1\n\u0001\nthe q-exponential function eq q k+1 , i.e., e\u22121\nq\n=\n(q;\nq)\n\u221e /(q; q)k . Consequently,\nq\nsubstituting this result into Iq (n), it is then immediate to show that\n(q; q)\u221e X q k(n+1)\n(q; q)\u221e\n(q; q)n\nIq (n) =\n=\n=\n= [n]q !.\nn\nn\nn+1\n(1 \u2212 q)\n(q; q)k\n(1 \u2212 q) (q\n; q)\u221e\n(1 \u2212 q)n\nk\u2208N\n\nSo, after some minor adjustments in our calculations, the right-hand side of equation\n(35) can be promptly reached. \u2752\nTo finish this section, let us discuss three important points raised by the identity\n(35). The first point corresponds to the resolution of unity for the coherent states\nwhich is implicitly demonstrated in our evaluations. By its turn, combining this result\nwith the first property, we can conclude that equation (31) produces a special set of\novercomplete q-deformed coherent states. The second point is entirely related to the\nterm appearing in the right-hand side of equation (35): it reflects the normalization\ncondition for the complex representations used in this work. Finally, the last point\nis associated with the evidence that d2 \u03c3q (\u03bc) may not be unique as some studies that\nappeared in the literature [27, 28] indicate. In fact, different integration measures\ncan produce distinct integrals Iq (n) whose integrands, by their turn, are related to\nsolutions of Stieltjes and Hausdorff moment problems [55, 56].\n5. Phase states\nPreviously, in section 3, we have established the q-differential forms for the lowering,\nraising and number operators whose respective actions on the RS functions resemble\nthose usually obtained for the annihilation, creation and number operators when acting\non the wavefunctions {\u03a8HO\nn (x; \u03b1)}n\u2208N associated with the usual harmonic oscillator.\nThis particular analogy leads us to investigate the possibility of constructing a polar\ndecomposition for the lowering (raising) operator B (B\u2020 ) through the equivalence\n1/2\n1/2\nrelation B \u2261 [N + 1]q E \u2212 (B\u2020 \u2261 E + [N + 1]q ), where N denotes the standard\nnumber operator.+ Moreover, E \u2213 represent two 'exponential' operators which will\nbe explored adequately in this section. It is important to stress that the underlying\nproblems of this specific decomposition and their possible solutions with convenient\ninherent mathematical properties were extensively discussed in the literature [49, 50].\nHere, our focus will be the construction of orthogonal eigenstates related to the qdeformed cosine and sine operators, in analogy with the results discussed in [46, 47],\nnamely\n1\n1\n(37)\nC := (E \u2212 + E + ) and S := (E \u2212 \u2212 E + ) ,\n2\n2i\nas well as the calculation of certain mean values pertain to C and S which allow us to\ndetermine some intrinsic properties of the coherent states described in section 4.\nInitially, let us assume that E \u2213 acting on the RS functions \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) results in the\nRS\nidentity E \u2213 \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) \u2261 \u03a8n\u22131 (z; q), i.e., its action decreases/increases the excitation\ndegree n of the q-deformed HO by one [46]. The next step then consists in solving the\neigenvalue equation\nCX\u03b3 (z; q) = cos(\u03b3)X\u03b3 (z; q)\n+\n\nB\u2020 B\n\n(38)\n\nIt is important to mention that Nq \u2261\ncoincides with the standard number operator N only\nin the limit q \u2192 1\u2212 [29]. In this case, the operator N is subjected to the commutation relations\n[N, B] = \u2212B and [N, B\u2020 ] = B\u2020 , which differ, by its turn, of those obtained in equation (30) for Nq .\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n16\n\nfollowing the mathematical recipe described in [47].

In all these pictures,\nthe solid line corresponds to the left-hand side of the inequality (50), while the righthand side is represented by the dashed line. Now, let us say some few words about\nthe space filled (gray color) between both the curves: since the convergence criterion\n0 \u2264 (1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 < 1 restricts the domain of the variables q and |\u03bc|2 , we can verify that\nthe area related to this space decreases for values of q near to 1\u2212 and 0 < |\u03bc|2 \u2264 4 -\nsee figures 4(a)-4(b). A plausible explanation of this fact leads us to the q-deformed\ncoherent states - here represented by the eigenfunctions {F\u03bc (z; q)}\u03bc\u2208C - and their\ninherent properties, i.e., these particular states are not minimum uncertainty states\n(excepting the vacuum state |\u03bc| = 0), which justifies, in principle, the appearance of\nthis specific region between the curves and its possible variation. As a last comment,\nlet us mention that VN 6= hNi\u03bc in such a case, which implies that {|Cn (\u03bc; q)|2 }n\u2208N are\nnot Poisson-distributed.\n7.

In all cases, the dashed line corresponds to the constant\nvalue 41 , which reflects the pattern behaviour observed for the nondeformed\ncoherent states. Note that for values of q close to 1\u2212 , the space filled (gray color)\nbetween the curves diminishes, and when |\u03bc|2 \u226b 1 we obtain the asymptotic limit\nUsym \u2192 14 .\n\nalgebras, they still remain practically unexplored if one considers the wide range of\napplications in quantum mechanics. A remarkable property of this sort of orthogonal\npolynomials states that {Hn (z; q)}n\u2208N are orthogonalized on the unit circle (pictorially\nrepresented in the complex plane) by means of a particular measure, the Jacobi \u03b83 function [42]. In the quantum-mechanical context, the benefits of this kind of angular\nrepresentation, if employed in the fascinating problem of the polar decomposition of\nthe annihilation operator concerning the usual harmonic oscillator (or, in other words,\non the existence of a well-defined operator corresponding to the phase observable\nof the electromagnetic field in quantum optics), were not investigated until now or\neven mentioned in the literature. Here, we have presented an appreciable set of\nnew interesting results which have potential applications not only in the investigative\nprocess on the different polar decompositions of the q-deformed annihilation operator\n[48], where the aforementioned angular representation has an important rule, but\nalso in the study of a q-analogue to the Jordan-Schwinger mapping for the angular\nmomentum operators [29].\nOnce the Szeg\u00f6 measure can be decomposed in the complex plane, it is natural to\nconstruct a set of complex functions that not only embodies such decomposition but\nalso satisfies automatically an orthogonality relation analogous to that derived for the\nRS polynomials. Before we perform such task, some essential mathematical properties\ninherent to these polynomials have been adequately reviewed in our explanatory\nnotes; in addition, we have also obtained two new integral representations for the\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n21\n\nRS polynomials which establish an important link with the q-Pochhammer symbol\nand the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials [43]. In fact, such results have paved the way\nfor subsequent developments towards a solid framework of coherent and phase states\nconceived within a purely algebraic approach.\nNamed as Rogers-Szeg\u00f6 functions and here denoted by {\u03a8RS\nn (z; q)}n\u2208N , our object\nof study was then defined in terms of the product Rn (z; q)M (z; q), where the first\nterm Rn (z; q) presents a direct connection with the RS polynomials, while the second\nterm M (z; q) represents a complex weight function. The particular parametrization\n1\n\nz = \u2212q \u2212 2 ei\u03c6 with \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] has allowed us to verify that \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) can be\northogonalized on a unit circle for any q \u2208 (0, 1). Furthermore, we have also established\na set of interesting formal results that characterize its inherent algebraic properties.\nFor example, the discussion about the completeness relation pertaining to the RS\nfunctions was carried out by means of the bilinear kernel K\u03b5 (w, z; q), which obeys\ncertain properties that lead us to reveal the normalization condition for the complex\nrepresentations used in this work to describe such functions. In the following, we\nhave analyzed separately each term of \u03a8RS\nn (z; q) with the aim of obtaining not only\nnew recurrence relations for Rn (z; q) but also some scaling relations for M (z; q) that\ninvolve odd and even powers of the parameter q. As a by-product of this analysis,\nwe have introduced a specific definition of Jackson's q-derivative that permits us to\ndetermine two closed-form expressions which connect the action of Dq2 over \u03a8RS\nn (z; q)\nwith the different excitation degrees n and n \u2213 1, preserving, by its turn, the phase of\nthe RS functions. So, the construction of q-differential forms of the lowering, raising\nand number operators from these results can be considered, at this stage, an immediate\nprocess. Those differential representations were then interpreted as the particular\nrealization of the IACK algebra which was characterized, within this context, through\nwell-established commutation relations.\nThe applications of this algebraic approach in the construction process of coherent\nand phase states certainly represented an ideal scenario within our investigative\ntheoretical framework. In this way, we adopted in a first moment the mathematical\nprocedure developed by Barut-Girardello [51] for the coherent states with the main\naim of establishing the respective eigenfunctions {F\u03bc (z; q)}\u03bc\u2208C related to the lowering\noperator B. Such eigenfunctions were initially conceived as an infinite expansion of\nthe Rogers-Szeg\u00f6 functions whose coefficients satisfy a proper eigenvalue equation\nwhich leads us to obtain the excitation probability distribution for the q-deformed\ncoherent state. Besides, we evaluated the overlap probability and also discussed the\ncompleteness relation in this case. Hounkonnou and Ngompe Nkouankam [30] recently\nshowed an interesting study on the generalized hypergeometric coherent states, where\na (q, \u03bd)-deformation was introduced in such a case. In that work, the authors employed\nbasically some theoretical methods of quantum optics for investigating the quantum\nstatistical properties as well as the Husimi distribution (and its corresponding phase\ndistribution) of those particular coherent states. Such analysis can also be applied\nwithin the context here discussed, this fact being object of future investigations.\nFinally, let us now briefly comment on the results obtained for the phase states.\nBasically, we have followed the Carruthers-Nieto approach [47] for the construction of\nthe eigenstates related to the q-deformed cosine and sine operators, whose respective\nphase distributions have exhibited analogous behaviours but with distinct signatures\n(both the distributions are \u03c02 -dephased) in the \u03b3\u03c6 plane. Next, we have discussed two\nbasic properties inherent to the eigenstates {X\u03b3 (z; q)}\u03b3\u2208[0,\u03c0] and {Y\u03b3 (z; q)}\u03b3\u2208[\u2212 \u03c0 , \u03c0 ]\n2 2\n\n\fM A Marchiolli et al\n\n22\n\nwhich reflect their orthogonality and completeness (or resolution of unity) relations. In\naddition, we have applied our results in order to derive a set of closed-form expressions\nfor certain mean values associated with the aforementioned cosine and sine operators\nvia q-deformed coherent states, which allow us to study the Robertson-Schr\u00f6dinger\nuncertainty relation. To complete this initial study, we have also derived a symmetrical\nuncertainty relation (here involving the variances and covariances of the cosine, sine\nand nondeformed number operators) that corroborates our previous conclusions on\nthose coherent states: once the convergence criterion 0 \u2264 (1 \u2212 q)|\u03bc|2 < 1 be satisfied,\nthey are not minimum uncertainty states (excepting the vacuum state |\u03bc| = 0).\nAlthough the mathematical significance of q deformation is presently approached\nas being a parameter responsible for the distribution width, its physical appeal is not\nquite clear. In fact, even the squeezing and/or nonlinear effects attributed to q deserve\nto be investigated in details [16]. Furthermore, the difficulties in solving the intriguing\nproblem related to the phase operator in quantum mechanics still remain the same\n[49]. In this sense, it is worth stressing that the compilation of results here presented\nnot only corroborates and generalizes those obtained in [25, 47], but also represents\na concatenated effort in joining two promising research branches of mathematics and\nphysics, namely the branches devoted to the study of q-special functions and certain\nangular representations in quantum theory [58].\nIn a more pragmatical sense, the previously discussed Rogers-Szeg\u00f6 functions can\nbe seen to be tailored for describing deformed physical systems where the rotational\ndegree of freedom has a central role. Indeed, some previous attempts of introducing\nrotational coherent states have been put forth in the past whose aim was to treat\nthe dynamics of two-dimensional deformed systems in molecular physics [59]. In this\nconnection, the use of the algebraic framework here developed in such studies of rigid\ndeformed systems dynamics - within the context of von Neumann-Liouville formalism\n- seems to be a promising perspective. Moreover, our results also seem to be quite\nsuitable to deal with the problem of quantum rings [60], where a single electron can\nbe trapped in a region whose topology is exactly that regarded in this work. In the\nmeantime, it is worth stressing that there exists another way of future research which\nwill be properly explored in due time.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the anonymous referees for useful comments on an earlier version\nof this paper.\nReferences\n[1] See, for instance, the interesting comments of Richard Askey on the Ramanujan's work published\nin Amer.
