The wires,\nabout 10 microns in diameter, were obtained by glass-coated melt spinning technique.\nSamples with positive magnetostriction (MS) have a rectangular bistable hysteresis\nloop. A smooth hysteresis loop is observed for wires with nearly zero MS. When MS\nis negative, almost no hysteresis is observed. The GMI was measured in the frequency\nrange between 20 Hz and 30 MHz. The shapes of the impedance versus field curves\nare qualitatively similar to each other for both positive and zero MS samples.\nImpedance is maximum at zero field, and decreases sharply in the range 10-20 Oe. For\nthe negative MS wires, when the driving current is small, the impedance is maximum\nat a finite external field. The position of the maximum approaches zero with\nincreasing current. The contributions of the moment rotation and domain wall motion\nin the three cases are discussed.\n\nThe giant magnetoimpedance (GMI)1 in conducting soft magnetic materials\nsuch as amorphous or nanocrystalline wires, ribbons and films is considered as a base\nfor high frequency magnetic sensor applications. It is established that the GMI can be\nassociated with the effect of the applied dc magnetic field on the magnetic\npermeability in the direction transverse with respect to the ac current through the\nconductor, or, for cylindrical samples, in the circumferential direction. For a\ncylindrical magnetic conductor, the impedance can be written in the form:1 Z =\nRdckaJ0(ka)/2J1(ka), where k = (1+i)/\u03b4m, \u03b4m = c/(2\u03c0\u03c9\u03c3\u03bc\u03c6)1/2, Rdc is the dc resistance, J0\nand J1 are the Bessel functions, a is the radius of the wire, \u03b4m is the penetration depth,\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0f is the frequency, \u03c3 the conductivity and \u03bc\u03c6 the effective complex magnetic\npermeability in the circumferential direction. The dominating contribution to the\n1\n\n\feffective permeability can be due either to the rotation of magnetization or to domain\nwall motion, depending on the magnetic anisotropy and domain wall stiffness. In the\namorphous soft magnetic materials, the sign and magnitude of magnetostriction (MS),\ncombined with the type of stresses in the samples, play a dominant role in the\nformation of the magnetic domain structure and hence in the sensitivity of the GMI\neffect. Glass-covered soft magnetic amorphous microwires2 constitute an important\nclass of materials of potential importance for applications. GMI has been studied, for\nexample, in CoFeSiB and FeCuNbSiB glass covered wires.3,4. In this article we report\nmeasurements of the GMI in amorphous Co75Si10B15, Co68.2Mn6.8Si10B15, and\nCo68Mn7Si10B15 glass covered wires. The values of magnetostriction in these three\nmaterials are respectively negative, nearly zero and positive, thus providing a\npossibility of a comparative study of GMI in samples with three different types of\nmagnetic anisotropy.\nThe wires, with core diameters between 8 \u03bcm and 12.5 \u03bcm and the glass cover\nthickness between 4.3 \u03bcm and 7.5 \u03bcm, were obtained by glass-coated melt spinning\ntechnique.2 The dc hysteresis loops were measured by a superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID) magnetometer in the direction parallel to the sample\naxes. The GMI was measured on a HP 4284A RLC meter in the frequency range\nbetween 20 Hz and 1 MHz, and HP 4285A RLC meter in the range 75 kHz- 30 MHz.\nA Helmholtz coil was used to generate magnetic field parallel to the wire axis in the\nrange -115.5 Oe \u2264 H \u2264 115.5 Oe.\nFigure 1 shows the measured magnetization curves for the three samples. The\nwire of the base alloy Co75Si10B15 has a negative MS.5 A loop with almost no\nhysteresis is observed for this sample [Fig. 1(a), curve 1]. This behavior has been\nattributed5 to circular domain structure due to magnetoelastic anisotropy. It is related\nto the distribution of stressed generated in the wire preparation process and is due to\nthe difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of metal and glass. Curve 2 in\nFig. 1(a) shows the hysteresis loop for this sample after annealing by ac current with a\nroot mean square (rms) value of 50 mA for 0.5 hours. After annealing the anisotropy\nfield HK is reduced to about 50 Oe compared to 80 Oe in the as-prepared sample. The\nsubstitution of cobalt atoms by manganese leads to a decrease of the absolute value of\nnegative MS. As has been reported before,6 in Co68.5Mn6.5Si10B15 the hysteresis loop\nis very similar to that shown in Fig. 1(a), except that the value of anisotropy field HK \u2248\n4 Oe. Close to this composition, even a very small increase of the Mn content\ndrastically changes the magnetic behavior of the samples.\nA smooth hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 1(b) is observed for wires of\nCo68.2Mn6.8Si10B15. According to the analysis of Ref. 2, this behavior is a signature a\nMS very close to zero. One can assume that a magnetic structure resulting in the loop\nof Fig. 1(b) may be a combination of domains directed along the sample axis in the\nmetal wire core and radial magnetization in the outer shell close to the metal-glass\ninterface. The picture is very different for the sample of Co68Mn7Si10B15 (Fig. 1(c)).\nThis sample has a sharp rectangular hysteresis loop associated with positive\nmagnetostriction2,5 and axial alignment of magnetization. An almost square and very\nnarrow loop, with the coercive force HC smaller than 1 Oe, shows that this sample has\n\n2\n\n\fa quasi single domain magnetic structure where the domain wall is easily moved by\nthe external axial field.\nFigure 2 shows the dependencies of the modulus of impedance Z = \uf8e6R+iX\uf8e6, at\nseveral frequencies, on the axial external magnetic field H for the same three samples.\nWe will start our consideration with the samples with zero and positive MS. One can\nsee that the shapes of the dependencies for samples with radial and axial\nmagnetizations (Fig. 2(b) and 2(c)) are almost similar to each other. The impedance\nhas a sharp maximum at zero field, and saturates to a constant value depending on\nfrequency in the field of about 25 Oe. At a frequency of 30 MHz, the saturated MI\nratios \u2206Z/Zs for these two samples are about 153% and 138 %, where \u2206Z/Zs is defined\nas [Z(H = 0) - Z(H = 115 Oe)]/Z(H = 115 Oe). The GMI has a maximum sensitivity\n\u2206Z\nof 65 %/Oe for sample Co68.2Mn6.8Si10B15, and 66 %/Oe for sample\n[d ( ) / dH ]\nZ\nmax\nCo68Mn7Si10B15. The field and frequency dependences of the impedance for these\nsamples are in line with the conventional interpretation of GMI in terms of classical\nelectrodynamics,1 assuming that the soft magnetic properties are due to magnetic\nmoment rotation.\nThe dependencies of the impedance of the as-cast sample with composition\nCo75Si10B15 on the axial magnetic field H, at a driving current of 2.5 mA and\nfrequencies 1, 15 and 30MHz, are shown in Fig. 2 (a). Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the\nbehavior for the same sample before and after annealing respectively, at a fixed\nfrequency f = 1 MHz. At a small current, the impedance as a function of the axial field\nhas two peaks at the peak values of the field \u00b1HP. The value of HP increases slowly\n(approximately logarithmically) with frequency, from 30 Oe at f = 10 kHz to about 60\nOe at 30 MHz. This GMI behavior is qualitatively similar to that reported previously\nfor a wire with a much smaller negative MS.6 One can also notice that when the\ncurrent is small, at low frequency f \u2264 1 MHz there is a local maximum at zero field,\nwith the width of several Oe [Fig. 3(a)]. At higher frequency this maximum is\nreplaced by a minimum as seen in Fig. 2(a). Figure 3 shows the plots of normalized\nimpedance of this sample versus external longitudinal magnetic field at different\nvalues of the driving current, at a frequency of 1 MHz, both for the as-cast sample\n[Fig. 3(a)] and the sample after annealing by the ac current of 50 mA for 0.5 hours\n[Fig. 3(b)]. With increasing current, the peak field HP decreases and the height of the\npeaks at HP increases. The two maxima merge into a single peak when the current\nexceeds the critical value of IC \u224820 mA, which corresponds to a circumferential field\nHC \u2248 6.7 Oe. After annealing, both the values of the peak field and the critical current\nare smaller than those in the as-cast sample.\nWe assume that there are three physically different contributions to the GMI\nbehavior in sample Co75Si10B15 related to circumferential anisotropy. The low-current\nlow-field behavior of the magnetoimpedance can be understood as being due to the\nfield and frequency dependence of cicumferential magnetic permeability and hence of\nthe skin depth. The reversible motion of domain walls about their equilibrium\npositions is dominant when the frequency of the driving current is below the domain\nwall relaxation frequency fdw ~1 MHz.7 This part of circumferential permeability is\n\n3\n\n\fstrongly suppressed by the axial magnetic field,7 and hence leads to a maximum of Z\nat zero field. At high frequency, the rotational component becomes more important\nwhich increases with field in small fields providing a minimum of Z at H = 0.\nThe maxima centered at larger fields 30 Oe<H<60 Oe, which exist at all\nfrequencies, are difficult to be explained in the above model. It is likely that these\nfeatures are not directly related to the skin depth. Instead, one can use the explanation\nproposed in Ref. 8 for the GMI in nonmagnetic wires electroplated with a magnetic\nlayer with circumferential anisotropy. The voltage along the axis of the quasisingle\ndomain cylindrical film is associated, via the Faraday's law, with a flux jump during a\ndomain wall motion under action of the current-induced circumferential magnetic\nfield. The apparent features of the effect are similar to those observed in our sample.\nHowever, it was shown8 using the formalism of the Stoner-Wolhfarth model,9 that the\ncicrcumferential field needed to merge the two peaks of GMI into one is close to the\nanisotropy field HK. In our sample, the critical circumferential field HC \u22486.7 Oe is\nconsiderably smaller than HK \u2248 80 Oe (for the as-prepared sample). This may be due\nto some anisotropy dispersion associated with the stress inhomogeneity.\nOne of the authors (X. X.
