The work paves the way towards\nquantum simulation of long-range interacting many-body systems.\nPACS numbers: 37.30.+i, 42.50.-p, 05.30.Rt\n\nExperiments with ultracold gases have succeeded in\nrealizing a variety of quantum many-body phases by exploiting the tunability of short-range atom-atom interactions [1]. Creating quantum gases with long-range interactions [2\u20135] is motivated by the prospect of observing\npreviously unexplored phenomena and phases [6]. In particular, long-range interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) have been predicted [7\u201310] to give rise\nto an excitation spectrum similar to the roton spectrum\nobserved in superfluid helium [11]. A roton spectrum\nemerges from density-density correlations which can be\ninduced by short-range van-der-Waals interactions as in\nliquid helium or by momentum-dependent long-range interactions in dilute quantum gases [7]. Such a mode softening at finite momentum has been proposed as a possible\nroute to a supersolid phase [12].\nImportant steps towards realizing quantum gases with\nlong-range interactions have been achieved by cooling\natomic species with large magnetic dipole moment to\nquantum degeneracy [2, 5] and by the efforts to prepare\nultracold polar molecules in their ground state [3, 4]. Effects of long-range interactions in quantum gases have\nbeen observed in the anisotropic expansion, in collective\nas well as Bloch oscillations, and in the stability of interacting dipolar BEC [13\u201316]. However, a roton-type mode\nsoftening requires very strong long-range interactions and\nis challenging to observe in quantum gases.\nA different approach to long-range interactions in cold\ngases makes use of the radiative coupling between electric dipoles induced by off-resonant laser light, which has\nbeen shown theoretically to cause a roton-like minimum\nin the energy spectrum of a BEC [8, 10]. A large enhancement of such radiative coupling is achieved by placing the\ndipoles into an optical resonator, which leads to strong\nglobal atom-atom interactions [17, 18, 20, 33].\nWe create long-range interactions in a BEC by placing it into an optical high-finesse cavity and irradiating\nthe atoms with a transverse pump laser, which is far detuned from the atomic transition frequency [21, 32, 36]\n\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental scheme and mode softening. (A)\nA 87 Rb BEC inside a Fabry-Perot resonator is transversally\nilluminated by a far red-detuned standing-wave laser field.\nIn a quantized picture, atoms off-resonantly scatter photons from the pump field into a close-detuned TEM00 cavity mode and back at rate N V /~ (see text), creating and\nannihilating pairs of atoms in the superposition of momenta\n(px , pz ) = (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k) (see close-up displaying one of four possible processes). This results in global interactions between\nall N atoms. The interaction strength V is controlled via the\npower of the transverse laser field. (B) The cavity-mediated\natom-atom interaction causes a softening of a collective excitation mode at momenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k), and a diverging susceptibility (blue shade) at a critical interaction strength (dashed\nline).\n\n(Fig. 1A). The induced electric dipoles of the atoms oscillate at the pump laser frequency and collectively couple\nto a single cavity mode, which is detuned from the pump\nfrequency by a few cavity linewidths. In turn, the induced cavity field leads to an ac Stark shift in the atoms.\nThe resulting atom-atom interaction extends over the entire atomic cloud and is tunable in strength. For a critical\nstrength of the long-range interactions, the BEC undergoes a quantum phase transition to a supersolid phase\nwith checkerboard density order [36], as observed in [32].\nAt the phase transition a discrete spatial symmetry provided by the cavity mode structure is broken, thus establishing nontrivial diagonal long-range order. We have\n\n\fV(r, r0 ) = V cos(kx) cos(kz) cos(kx0 ) cos(kz 0 )\n\n(1)\n\nand describes the ac Stark shift experienced by an atom\nat position r as a result of the cavity field induced by\na second atom at position r0 . As a consequence of the\ninterference between the mediating cavity field and the\ntransverse pump field, the spatial dependence of the interaction is determined by the corresponding mode functions cos(kx) and cos(kz), where k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb denotes the\noptical wavevector (Fig. 1A). The interaction strength\n \u0303 c depends on the two-photon Rabi frequency\nV = ~\u03b7 2 /\u2206\n\u03b7 which can be tuned experimentally via the transverse\npump power P [25]. The sign of V is determined by\n \u0303 c = \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c9\u0303c between the transverse pump\nthe detuning \u2206\nlaser frequency \u03c9p and the dispersively shifted cavity res \u0303 c | is large compared to\nonance \u03c9\u0303c . In the experiment |\u2206\nthe cavity linewidth 2\u03ba.\nFor negative V , the cavity-mediated interaction induces density correlations in the atomic cloud with spatial periodicity of \u03bb along the pump and cavity direction.\nIn momentum space, this corresponds to the creation and\nannihilation of pairs of correlated atoms in the momentum mode |ei, which is the symmetric superposition of\nthe four momentum states |px , pz i = | \u00b1 ~k, \u00b1~ki. For\na macroscopically populated zero-momentum mode containing N atoms, this is described by the Hamiltonian\n[25]\n\u0124 = 2Er \u0109\u2020 \u0109 +\n\nNV \u2020\n(\u0109 + \u0109)2 ,\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0109\u2020 creates particles in mode |ei. The first term in\nEq. 2 corresponds to the kinetic energy of atoms in mode\n2 2\nk\n|ei, with the recoil energy Er = ~2m\nand the atomic mass\nm.\nThe elementary excitations of the Hamiltonian \u0124 are\nof collective nature and their eigenenergy Es softens for\nincreasing interaction strength V (Fig. 1B). The excitation energy Es vanishes at a critical interaction strength\nVcr , where interaction and kinetic energy are balanced,\ni.e. N |Vcr | = 2Er . This marks the transition point between a normal and a supersolid phase.

The method combines Bragg\nspectroscopy [24] and cavity-enhanced Bragg scattering,\nand we use it to observe a notable change in the dispersion relation while crossing the phase transition. This\nis complemented by a diverging susceptibility, in agreement with the second-order nature of the phase transition\n(Fig. 1B).\nThe cavity-mediated long-range interaction is described by the\nR Hamiltonian\n\u0124aa =\n\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r)\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r0 )V(r, r0 )\u03a8\u0302(r0 )\u03a8\u0302(r)d3 rd3 r0 with\natomic field operator \u03a8\u0302(r).

(B) Excited atomic population Ne with\nmomenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k), deduced from the regions enclosed by\nblue circles in A, as a function of the probe-pump detuning\n\u03b4 (circles).

(E) Mean intracavity photon number hnph i, averaged over\nthe probe interval, as a function of \u03b4 (circles). The fit (solid\nline) takes into account the calibrated photon number of the\nprobe pulse (dashed line). From the recorded photon signal\nwe deduce the photon number originating from Bragg scattering off the created excitations (dashed-dotted line). The\nshading in B and E indicates the fluctuations caused by variations of the relative phase \u03c6 between different experimental\nruns. The detuning of the pump beam from the empty cavity\nresonance was \u2206c = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 18 MHz and the total atom number N = 1.6(2) \u00d7 105 . The damping constant \u03b3 was set to\n0.6 kHz (see text).\n\nphase, a macroscopic occupation of the mode |ei gives rise\nto a checkerboard pattern in the atomic density distribution, which is accompanied by the build-up of a coherent\ncavity field amplitude \u03b10 . The energy of collective excitations rises again with increasing interaction strength\nand approaches the single-particle excitation energy of\nthe induced optical checkerboard potential.\nTo measure the excitation spectrum of the system at\nmomenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k), we perform a variant of Bragg\nspectroscopy [24, 26]. After preparing the system at a\ngiven interaction strength, the cavity field is excited with\na weak probe pulse along the x-axis (Fig. 1A). Interference between the cavity probe field and the transverse\n\n\f3\n10\nExcitation energy Es (h \u00d7 kHz)\n\npump field results in an amplitude-modulated lattice\n\u221a\npotential \u03b7 npr cos(\u03b4t + \u03c6) cos(kx) cos(kz), with probepump detuning \u03b4 = \u03c9pr \u2212 \u03c9p , relative phase \u03c6 and mean\nintracavity photon number npr of the probe field. In\nmomentum\np space, this corresponds to the perturbation\n\u0124pr = \u03b7 npr N cos(\u03b4t + \u03c6)(\u0109\u2020 + \u0109). After probing, all\nlaser fields are switched off. This projects the created collective excitations onto the free-space momentum states\n|\u00b1~k, \u00b1~ki, which are detected via absorption imaging\nsubsequent to ballistic expansion (Fig. 2A). A typical\nresonance curve of the excited momentum state population Ne = h\u0109\u2020 \u0109i as a function of \u03b4 is shown in Fig. 2B.\nClear resonances are revealed both for positive and negative probe-pump detuning, corresponding to stimulated\nscattering of probe photons into the pump field and vice\nversa. The corresponding resonance frequency Es /~ is\nobtained from a fit (solid line) based on the model description Eq. 2 [25].\nThe measured excitation spectrum as a function of\npump power P is displayed in Fig. 3. When increasing\nthe interaction strength in the normal phase towards the\ncritical point, the excitation energy Es exhibits a distinct softening. In contrast, for positive V , the excitation gap is observed to increase with interaction strength\nin accordance with the absence of a phase transition.\nThe increasing gap reflects the tendency of the cavitymediated interactions to suppress density fluctuations\nwith \u03bb-periodicity.\nWe monitor the cavity output light on a single-photon\ncounting module. This gives us real-time access to the\nformation of collective excitations during probing. Because of matter-wave interference between the groundstate component of the condensate and the created excitations, a spatial density modulation evolves in time.\nTransverse pump light is Bragg scattered by this density modulation into the cavity mode. The output from\nthe cavity therefore follows the oscillatory evolution of\nthis density modulation (Fig. 2C). The total intracavity photon number, averaged over the probe interval,\nagain exhibits a double resonance (Fig. 2E), whose characteristic shape has its origin in interference between the\nprobe field (dashed) and the Bragg scattered pump field\n(dashed-dotted). This provides a second method to determine the resonance frequency Es /~, as shown in Fig. 3.\nWe model the dynamics of the system during probing by evolving the Hamiltonian \u0124 + \u0124pr in time, taking into account the recorded shape of the probe pulse,\nsee Fig. 2C. Quantitative agreement with the data is obtained by including a phenomenological damping rate \u03b3\nin the time evolution of \u0109 [25]. The corresponding time\nevolution of the momentum population Ne (t) is shown\nin Fig. 2D. Depending on the relative phase \u03c6, which is\nnot controlled in the experiment, the phase of the excited\ndensity oscillation varies between different experimental\nruns. This leads to an intrinsic fluctuation of the quantities Ne and hnph i, as indicated by the shaded areas in\n\nV> 0\n\n8\nV< 0\n\n6\n4\n\natom data\n\n2\n\nphoton data\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.8\nPump power P (Pcr )\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 3.

Gray shading shows the theoretical prediction including\nexperimental uncertainties [25]. The experimental parameters\nare N = 1.7(2) \u00d7 105 , \u2206c = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 (19.8, 23.2)MHz for V < 0\n(normal and supersolid phase) and \u2206c = +2\u03c0 \u00d7 15.1 MHz for\nV > 0. For V > 0, the pump power is scaled in terms of the\ncritical pump power observed for \u2206c = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 19.7 MHz.\n\nFig. 2B and E.\nIn the supersolid phase, the perturbation creates excitations on top of the macroscopic steady-state population\nin momentum mode |ei [32]. Because of matter-wave\ninterference, the detected population Ne is strongly affected by fluctuations of the relative phase \u03c6. Yet, the\nvariance of Ne around the steady-state value, deduced\nfrom several experimental runs, shows clear resonances.\nAlternatively, we use the oscillation amplitude of the intracavity photon number around the steady-state value\n|\u03b10 |2 to extract the excitation energy Es [25]. As shown\nin Fig. 3, the excitation energies deduced from these two\nsignals rise again with pump power P and provide a consistent picture.\nThe observed excitation spectrum (Fig. 3) is in qualitative\np agreement with a soft mode energy Es =\n2Er 1 + V /|Vcr | which follows from Eq. 2. Quantitative agreement is obtained by further taking into account\nthe lattice potential of the transverse pump beam as well\nas contact interactions between colliding atoms [25]. Accordingly, the single-particle mode |ei in Eq. 2 is replaced\nby a Bogoliubov mode |1i and the interaction energy\ngets renormalized by the matrix element of V(r, r0 ) between the condensate mode and the excited state |1i.\nIn the normal phase, the state |1i lies in the lowest energy band of the transverse lattice potential with quasimomentum (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k) and bare energy E1 . For P = 0\nthe excitation energy Es reaches the Bogoliubov energy\nE1 = h \u00d7 8.7 kHz, which is shifted by the mean-field energy with respect to the kinetic energy 2Er = h\u00d77.5 kHz.\n\n\f4\n\nDensity response R\u03c1\n\n12\n\n9\nResponse RN\n\n15\n\n6\n3\n\n9\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n0.5\n1.0\nPump power P (Pcr )\n\n3\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.8\nPump power P (Pcr )\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 4. Response to density perturbations. Shown is the\ndensity response in the normal and supersolid phase, normalized to the non-interacting case (P = 0). The shaded areas\nshow the theoretical prediction including experimental uncertainties and fluctuations caused by the uncontrolled relative\nphase \u03c6. The atomic damping constant \u03b3 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.5(1) kHz\nwas obtained from the fit to the data in the normal phase.\nThe inset shows the response of the excited momentum state\npopulation Ne for negative (filled circles) and positive (open\ncircles) interaction strength V . The experimental parameters\nwere the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nIn the supersolid phase, the Bogoliubov mode |1i, which\nis dominantly affected by the long-range interactions, lies\nin a higher energy band at zero quasi-momentum of the\nemerging checkerboard lattice potential. As a result of\ncompetition between the increasing band energy and the\nrenormalized interaction energy, the excitation energy Es\nrises again.\nAnother signature for a softened dispersion relation at\nfinite momentum is provided by the susceptibility to external density perturbations. In terms of the static structure factor S(k), which measures the density-density response, this is expressed by Feynman's relation S(k) =\n(~k 2 /2m)/\u03c9(k), where \u03c9(k) denotes the dispersion of a\nhomogeneous system [27]. To determine the density response in our system, we quantify the amount of pump\nlight which is Bragg scattered into the cavity. This allows us to measure the probe-induced density modulation\nh\u03b4 \u03c1\u0302e i, where \u03b4 \u03c1\u0302e denotes the density fluctuation operator\nat momenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k). We define the corresponding\nquadratic density response function R\u03c1 as the spectral\nweight of h\u03b4 \u03c1\u0302e i2 , normalized to the pump power P and\nthe probe pulse area hnpr i. The response function RN\nof the atomic population Ne in the excited momentum\nstate |ei is defined in a similar way [25].\nApproaching the critical point from below, a strongly\nincreasing density response is observed (Fig. 4). This\nindicates the presence of enhanced density fluctuations\nwith \u03bb-periodic correlations in the unperturbed system.\nThe data is in good agreement with our model (shading),\nwhich predicts R\u03c1 to scale as (E1 /Es )2 in the normal\n\nphase, in accordance with Feynman's relation. In the\nsupersolid phase, the density response decreases again as\na function of P , as expected for the increasing excitation\nenergy (Fig. 3). A similar behavior is observed for the\nresponse in the momentum state population Ne (Fig. 4,\ninset), which exhibits a larger sensitivity to variations\nof the relative phase \u03c6 [25]. For positive interaction V\n(Fig. 4, inset), the response of the system is reduced with\nrespect to the non-interacting case, V = 0.\nWe have observed a roton-type mode softening causing\na superfluid-to-supersolid transition in a model system\nfor long-range interactions. Increasingly complex spatial\nstructures of long-range atom-atom interactions [28\u201330]\ncan be tailored by extending the experimental setup to\nmultiple cavity modes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe thank H.

An effective Hamiltonian\nfor the cavity-mediated long-range interaction is derived.\nBased on a mean-field description, we numerically calculate the steady state of the system including contact\ninteractions and the transverse lattice potential. We deduce in a Bogoliubov approach the energy of collective\nexcitations, which softens towards the critical point. The\ntime evolution of the system during probing is derived\nand a diverging response to density perturbations at the\nphase transition is found.\nExperimental details\n\nThe atoms are prepared in the hyperfine state\n(F, mF ) = (1, \u22121) with respect to a quantization axis\npointing along the cavity axis, where F is the total angular momentum and mF the magnetic quantum number.\nThe transverse pump laser with wavelength \u03bb = 784.5 nm\nis linearly polarized along the y-axis (see Fig. 1 in the\nmain text) and off-resonantly drives, via the atoms, two\ndegenerate cavity TEM00 modes with circular polarizations \u000f+ and \u000f\u2212 . The ratio of the corresponding twophoton Rabi frequencies is given by \u03b7+ /\u03b7\u2212 = 3.26/1.25,\nwhere all allowed dipole transitions in the D1 and D2\nlines of 87 Rb have been taken into account. The maximum dispersive shift of the two cavity modes induced\nby a single maximally coupled atom is U0+ = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 87 Hz\nand U0\u2212 = 2\u03c0 \u00d733 Hz, respectively. The transverse pump\nlaser induces an optical lattice potential along the z-axis\nwith periodicity of \u03bb/2. Its depth Vp is calibrated using\nRaman-Nath diffraction [31] and takes for our experimental parameters a value of 3Er at the critical point,\n2 2\nk\n, wavevector k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, and\nwith recoil energy Er = ~2m\natomic mass m. In the theoretical analysis, the Gaussian\nenvelopes of the pump and cavity fields along the transverse directions [32] are effectively taken into account by\nweighted averages of Vp , \u03b7\u00b1 and U0\u00b1 over the spatial extent of the atomic cloud. The Thomas-Fermi radii of the\ncondensate in the external harmonic trapping potential\nare given by (Rx , Ry , Rz ) = (3.5, 18.3, 3.7) \u03bcm, assuming\nan atom number of N = 1.65 \u00d7 105 .\nThe length (176 \u03bcm) of the cavity is actively stabilized\nusing a laser with a wavelength of 830 nm, which is referenced onto the transverse pump laser. The depth of the\nresulting intracavity lattice potential was measured to\nbe 0.04(2)Er , and is neglected in the theoretical analysis.\nTransverse pump light and cavity probe light propagate\nthrough independent optical fibers, resulting in a variation of their relative phase \u03c6 between different experimental runs. The cavity output light is monitored on a\nsingle-photon counting module with an overall detection\n\n\f6\nefficiency of intracavity photons of 4(1)%. For the data\ntaken in the normal phase, the critical pump power Pcr\nwas deduced from the intracavity photon number monitored during independent sweeps across the phase transition.\nTheoretical description of the coupled\ncondensate-cavity system\n\nThe coupled condensate-cavity system is described in a\nmany-body formalism following Ref. [33, 34]. By adiabatically eliminating the fast cavity field dynamics, we derive\nan effective Hamiltonian, which describes the long-range\natom-atom interaction.\nAfter adiabatically eliminating the electronically excited states, the transversally driven condensate-cavity\nsystem is described by the many-body Hamiltonian \u0124 =\n\u0124c + \u0124a + \u0124a\u2212c , where\n\u0124c = \u2212 ~\u2206c \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\n\u0014 2\nZ\np\n+ Vp cos2 (kz)\n\u0124a =\nd3 r\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r)\n2m\n\u0015\ng\n+ \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r)\u03a8\u0302(r) \u03a8\u0302(r)\n2\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0124a\u2212c = d3 r\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r) ~\u03b7 cos(kx) cos(kz)(\u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 )\n\u0003\n+ ~U0 cos2 (kx)\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u03a8\u0302(r) ,\n\n(S1)\n\nwith bosonic atomic field operator \u03a8\u0302(r) and photon operators \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 . To keep the notation simple we describe\nonly one of the two circularly polarized TEM00 cavity\nmodes. Final results will be given for the case of two\ncavity modes.\nIn equation (S1), \u0124c describes the dynamics of a single\nTEM00 cavity mode with spatial mode function cos(kx),\nwhose frequency \u03c9c is detuned by \u2206c = \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c9c from\nthe pump laser frequency \u03c9p . The term \u0124a captures the\natomic evolution in the transverse optical lattice potential with depth Vp , including contact interactions with\n2\na\nstrength g = 4\u03c0~\nm , where a denotes the s-wave scattering length. The interaction between the atoms and the\npump and cavity light fields is governed by \u0124a\u2212c . The\nfirst term describes light scattering between pump and\ncavity field at a rate which is determined by the maximum two-photon Rabi frequency \u03b7. The second term\naccounts for the dispersive shift of the cavity resonance\nfrequency with light-shift U0 of a single maximally coupled atom.\nAs the cavity field reaches a steady-state on a time\nscale fast compared to atomic motion, its equation of\nmotion can be formally solved, yielding\n\u00e2 =\n\n\u03b7 \u0398\u0302\n(\u2206c \u2212 U0 B\u0302) + i\u03ba\n\n(S2)\n\nwith the cavity field decay rate \u03ba = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1.25 MHz.\nDue to Bragg scattering of pump light, the intracavity field amplitude\nis proportional to the order paramR\neter \u0398\u0302 = d3 r \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r) cos(kx) cos(kz)\u03a8\u0302(r) which measures the atomic density modulation on the checkerboard\npattern cos(kx) cos(kz). The overall dispersive shift of\nthe empty cavity resonance caused by the presence of\nthe atoms\nis proportional to the bunching parameter\nR\nB\u0302 = d3 r \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r) cos2 (kx)\u03a8\u0302(r).\nAfter eliminating the steady-state cavity field of\nEq. (S2) from Hamiltonian Eq. (S1), an effective Hamiltonian description is obtained (see main text, Eq. 1):\n\u0124eff = \u0124a + V\n\nR\n\nd3 rd3 r0 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r)\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (r0 ) cos(kx) cos(kz)\n\n\u00d7 cos(kx0 ) cos(kz 0 )\u03a8\u0302(r)\u03a8\u0302(r0 ).\n(S3)\nThe strength V of this cavity-meditated atom-atom in \u0303c\n\u03b72\n\u03b72 \u2206\nteraction is given by V = ~ \u2206\n \u0303 2 +\u03ba2 \u2248 ~ \u2206\n \u0303 c , where the\nc\ndetuning of the pump laser from the dispersively shifted\n \u0303 c = \u2206c \u2212 U0 B0 was taken to be large\ncavity resonance \u2206\ncompared to the cavity half-linewidth \u03ba. Here, B0 = hB\u0302i\ndenotes the bunching parameter in the steady state. In\na quantized picture, N V /~ corresponds to the rate at\nwhich cavity photons are exchanged between atoms, as\nshown exemplarily in the zoom of Fig. 1A in the main\ntext.\nThe effective Hamiltonian Eq. (S3) describes a closed\nsystem and neglects dynamical and quantum backaction\neffects originating from cavity decay and cavity input\nnoise. This is justified on short timescales as long as\n \u0303 c | \u001d \u03ba \u001d Er /~ [35].\n|\u2206\nMean-field description in the steady state\n\nBased on a mean-field description [36], we derive a\nnumerical solution of the steady state of the system.\nA mean-field description of the system is obtained by\nformally replacing the operators\n\u03a8\u0302 and \u00e2 in Eq. (S1)\n\u221a\nwith the atomic mean-field N \u03c80 and the coherent cavity amplitude \u03b10 , respectively. Their steady-state values\nare determined by the non-local Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n\u0012 2\n\u2212~\n\u03bc0 \u03c80 (x, z) =\n(\u2202 2 + \u2202z2 ) + Vp (z) + ~U0 (x)|\u03b10 |2\n2m x\n\u0013\n\u2217\n2\n+ ~\u03b7(x, z)(\u03b10 + \u03b10 ) + g2D |\u03c80 | \u03c80 (x, z)\n(S4)\n\u03b7\u03980\nwith \u03b10 = \u2206\n \u0303 c +i\u03ba and the chemical potential \u03bc0 . Here,\nwe introduced the steady state order parameter \u03980 =\nN h\u03c80 | cos(kx) cos(kz)|\u03c80 i and bunching parameter B0 =\nN h\u03c80 | cos2 (kx)|\u03c80 i, as well as the notations Vp (z) =\nVp cos2 (kz), \u03b7(x, z) = \u03b7 cos(kx) cos(kz) and U0 (x) =\n\n\f7\nU0 cos2 (kx). We reduced the description in Eq. (S4) to\nthe pump and cavity directions, assuming a homogeneous\ncondensate density along the weakly confined y-axis. The\ncontact interaction strength is accordingly replaced by\ng2D = \u03bb2 n\u0304g with average 3D condensate density n\u0304 and\nR\u03bb\nR\u03bb\nthe normalization condition 0 dx 0 dz |\u03c80 |2 = 1 [37].\n \u0303 c , Eq. (S4) exhibits a dynamical instaFor negative \u2206\nbility above a critical transverse pump power Pcr , driving\nthe system from a normal phase into a supersolid phase\nwith \u03bb-periodic density modulation. In the normal phase,\nP < Pcr , the condensate density is flat along the cavity\naxis, resulting in a vanishing order parameter, \u03980 = 0,\nand cavity field amplitude, \u03b10 = 0. The mean-field solution \u03c80 is given by the lowest energy Bloch state in the\nshallow optical lattice potential of the transverse pump\nfield. In the supersolid phase, P > Pcr , the atomic cloud\nexhibits a \u03bb-periodic density modulation both along the\ntransverse and the cavity direction. Correspondingly, the\norder parameter takes a finite value, \u03980 6= 0, and light\nscattering off the diagonal Bragg planes results in a coherent cavity field amplitude, \u03b10 6= 0. The mean-field\nsolution \u03c80 is given by the minimal energy state in the\ntwo-dimensional lattice potential originating from interference between the transverse and cavity field. In the supersolid phase, the emergent checkerboard density modulation locks to one of two possible sublattices, which\nare spatially shifted by \u03bb/2 and have opposite signs of\n\u03980 and \u03b10 . As both solutions share the same excitation\nspectrum, we assume \u03980 > 0 in the following.\nWe numerically find the ground state \u03c80 of the system by propagating Eq. (S4) in imaginary time, using\na computational cell of size \u03bb2 with periodic boundary\nconditions. We include the recorded steady state mean\nintracavity photon number |\u03b10 |2 and the experimentally\ncalibrated lattice depth Vp in the calculations.\nDeriving the collective excitation spectrum\n\nWe describe collective excitations on top of the meanfield solution. To this end, we calculate the Bogoliubov\nexcitations in the steady-state lattice potential and identify a single excitation mode which is dominantly affected\nby the long-range interactions. We diagonalize the resulting truncated Hamiltonian and deduce the energy of\ncollective excitations.\nFollowing Ref. [36], we expand the atomic and cavity\nfield operators around their mean-field solution (\u03c80 , \u03b10 )\naccording to\n\u221a\n\u03a8\u0302 = ( N \u03c80 + \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302)e\u2212it\u03bc0 /~\n\u00e2 = \u03b10 + \u03b4\u00e2.\n\n(S5)\n\nHere, the linearized cavity field fluctuation operator\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b7\n\u03980 U0\n\u03b4\u00e2 =\n\u03b4 \u0398\u0302 +\n\u03b4 B\u0302 .\n(S6)\n \u0303 c + i\u03ba\n \u0303 c + i\u03ba\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\n\u221a R\nis given in terms of the operators \u03b4 \u0398\u0302 = N d3 r (\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 +\n\u221a R 3\n\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302) cos(kx) cos(kz)\u03c80 and \u03b4 B\u0302 =\nN d r (\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 +\n\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302) cos2 (kx)\u03c80 , describing fluctuations of the order and\nbunching parameter around their steady-state values \u03980\nand B0 , taking \u03c80 to be real-valued.\nAfter eliminating the cavity field fluctuation \u03b4\u00e2, as \u0303 2 \u001d \u03ba2 , and keeping only linear terms in the\nsuming \u2206\nc\nequation of motion for \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302, we arrive at a quadratic\nHamiltonian\n\u00152\n\u0014\n\u03980 U0\n(S7)\n\u03b4 B\u0302\n\u0124exc = \u01240 + V \u03b4 \u0398\u0302 +\n \u0303c\n\u2206\ndescribing the dynamics of atomic fluctuations around\nthe mean-field solution. The first term \u01240 captures the\ndynamics in the static steady-state lattice potential including contact interactions, and is given by\n\u0014 2\nZ\n3\n\u2020 \u2212~\n\u01240 = d r \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\n(\u2202 2 + \u2202z2 ) + Vp (z)\n2m x\n\u0015\n+ ~\u03b7(x, z)(\u03b10 + \u03b10\u2217 ) + ~U0 (x)|\u03b10 |2 \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\n+\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ng2D \u03c802 \u03b4 \u03a8\u03022 + (\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 )2 + 2g2D |\u03c80 |2 \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302.\n2\n(S8)\n\nThe second term in Eq. (S7) describes how atomic density fluctuations are affected by the cavity-mediated longrange interaction.\nIn the normal phase, \u0124exc is directly obtained from\nEq. (S3) by quadratic expansion in \u03b4 \u03a8\u0302 around the steady\nstate. In the supersolid phase, the dispersive cavity shift,\nwhich depends on the atomic density distribution, gives\nrise to an additional long-range interaction term with\n\u03bb/2-periodicity along the cavity axis [34], whose strength\nis proportional to the order parameter \u03980 . However, as\nthe order parameter vanishes at the critical point, solely\nthe term \u03b4 \u0398\u03022 in Eq. (S7) induces the normal to supersolid\nphase transition.\nTo find the energy of collective excitations described\nby \u0124exc , we first calculate the elementary excitations of\n\u01240 using the Bogoliubov ansatz [38, 39]\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302(r) =\nuj (r)\u0109j + vj\u2217 (r)\u0109\u2020j ,\n(S9)\nj\n\nwith band index j, Bogoliubov modes uj (r) and vj (r),\nand corresponding mode operators \u0109j , fulfilling bosonic\ncommutation relations. In this basis the Hamiltonian\n\u0124exc reads\n\u0011\nX\u0010\nEj \u0109\u2020j \u0109j + N V \u03c7j (\u0109j + \u0109\u2020j )2 ,\n(S10)\n\u0124exc =\nj\n\nwith Bogoliubov energies Ej and interaction matrix elements\nD\nE2\n\u03980 U0\n\u03c7j = \u03c80 cos(kx) cos(kz) +\ncos2 (kx) uj + vj .\n \u0303c\n\u2206\n(S11)\n\n\f8\nA\n\nP\n\nB\n.3\n\n8\n6\n\n.2\n\n4\n.1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0\nPump power P (Pcr )\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\nPump power P (Pcr )\n\nMatrix element \u03c7\n\nEnergy (h \u00d7 kHz)\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFIG. 5. (A) Bare energies (blue) of the excited state with\nmaximum matrix element \u03c7 in the normal and supersolid\nphase. Dashed and solid blue lines correspond to the case of\nvanishing and present contact atom-atom interactions. The\nred dashed-dotted line shows the soft mode energy in the presence of long-range and contact atom-atom interactions. (B)\nMaximum matrix element \u03c7 in the presence (solid) and absence (dashed) of contact atom-atom interactions.\n\nFrom a numerical calculation of the matrix elements \u03c7j\nwe find in our parameter regime only a single Bogoliubov mode exhibiting a relevant matrix element \u03c7j for\nenergies up to 15Er . All other matrix elements \u03c7j are\nsuppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. In\nthe normal phase the maximally coupled excited mode\nlies in the lowest energy band of the transverse lattice\npotential with quasi-momentum (qx , qz ) = (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k).\nIn the supersolid phase this state is folded into the third\nband at the center of the Brillouin zone as a result of the\nemerging \u03bb-periodicity.\nIn terms of the excited mode with dominant matrix\nelement \u03c7j , which we denote in the following by the index\nj = 1, the effective Hamiltonian reduces to\n\u0124exc = E1 \u0109\u20201 \u01091 + N V \u03c7(\u01091 + \u0109\u20201 )2\n\n(S12)\n\nwith \u03c7 = \u03c71 . In the absence of the transverse lattice\npotential and contact atom-atom interactions, \u0124exc reduces in the normal phase to the Hamiltonian given in\nthe main text, Eq. 2.\nWe obtain the soft mode energy spectrum by diagonalizing Hamiltonian \u0124exc in terms of a second Bogoliubov\ntransformation b\u0302 = \u03bc\u01091 + \u03bd\u0109\u20201 . Up to a constant term,\nthis yields \u0124exc = Es b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 with soft mode energy\nr\n4N V \u03c7\nEs = E1 1 +\n.\n(S13)\nE1\nFor V < 0, Es softens towards the phase transition\nand vanishes at Vcr = \u2212E1cr /(4N \u03c7cr ) with (E1cr , \u03c7cr ) =\n(E1 , \u03c7)|P =Pcr . In the supersolid phase, the excitation energy rises again due to competition between the increasing Bogoliubov energy E1 and the decreasing interaction\nenergy which is proportional to the matrix element \u03c7 (see\nFig. S5).\nResults for two circularly polarized cavity modes \u00e2\u00b1\nare obtained by replacing V \u03c7 in (S12) and (S13) by\n\nn=\u00b1 Vn \u03c7n , with V\u00b1 and \u03c7\u00b1 deduced accordingly from\nthe cavity parameters (\u03b7\u00b1 , U0\u00b1 ). The calculated energy\nspectrum shown in Fig. 3 takes into account the experimentally calibrated depth of the transverse lattice potential and the measured steady-state intracavity photon\nnumber |\u03b10 |2 in the presence of atoms. Systematic uncertainties of these quantities are estimated to be 10%\nand 25%, respectively (see shaded regions in Fig. 3).\n\nProbing the collective excitation spectrum\n\nBy integrating the equation of motion of the atomic\nfield, we predict the build-up of atomic excitations and of\nthe cavity light field during probing.\nTo probe the excitation spectrum, we weakly drive\nthe cavity field with amplitude \u03b7pr (t) and frequency\n\u03c9pr . This is described by the driving Hamiltonian\n\u2212~\u03b7pr (t)(\u00e2ei(\u03b4t+\u03c6) + \u00e2\u2020 e\u2212i(\u03b4t+\u03c6) ) with probe-pump detuning \u03b4 = \u03c9pr \u2212 \u03c9p and relative phase \u03c6 between probe\nand pump beam. The resulting coherent intracavity\nprobe field is given by\n\u03b1pr (t) = \u2212\n\n\u03b7pr (t)e\u2212i(\u03b4t+\u03c6)\n.\n \u0303 c + i\u03ba\n\u2206\n\n(S14)\n\nInterference of the probe field with the transverse pump\nfield and the steady-state cavity field \u03b10 results in a modulated lattice potential. The corresponding perturbation\nof the atomic field is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nU0 \u03980\n\u0124pr = ~\u03be(t) \u03b4 \u0398\u0302 +\n\u03b4 B\u0302 cos(\u03b4t + \u03c6),\n(S15)\n \u0303 c + i\u03ba\n\u2206\np\nwith perturbation amplitude \u03be(t) = 2\u03b7 npr (t) and mean\n\u03b7 2 (t)\n \u0303 c| \u001d \u03ba\nintracavity photon number npr (t) = pr . As |\u2206\n \u0303 2 +\u03ba2\n\u2206\nc\n\nin the experiment, we set the phase shift, originating from\ncoupling into the cavity, to \u03c0. In terms of the mode\noperator \u01091 , the perturbation reads\np\n\u0124pr = ~\u03be(t) N \u03c7(\u01091 + \u0109\u20201 ) cos(\u03b4t + \u03c6) .\n(S16)\nTo quantify the response on this perturbation, we evolve\nthe Hamiltonian \u0124 = \u0124exc + \u0124pr in time according to\nthe Heisenberg equation\ni~\u0109 \u03071 =E1 \u01091 + 2N V \u03c7(\u01091 + \u0109\u20201 )\np\n+ ~\u03be(t) N \u03c7 cos(\u03b4t + \u03c6) \u2212 i~\u03b3\u01091 .\n\n(S17)\n\nMotivated by our experimental observations, we phenomenologically introduced a damping term with damping constant \u03b3 into the time evolution of \u01091 . This accounts for possible damping mechanisms like s-wave scattering with other momentum modes, trap loss or finitesize dephasing. The general solution of Eq. (S17) reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\nE1\n\u01091 (t) = 2\u03b7 N \u03c7npr,0\nIm(Y(t))+iRe(Y(t)) .

Here, the envelope function \u03a0(t) of the probe pulse with duration \u03c4\nand the maximum probe photon number npr,0 were introduced. The population of the excited momentum mode\nand the mean intracavity photon number are directly obtained from Eq. (S18)\nN1 (t) = h\u0109\u20201 \u01091 i\n\n\u00132\n\u0015\nE1\nIm(Y(t))2 + Re(Y(t))2\nEs\n\u0012 \u0013\n2\u221a\n4\u03b7 npr,0 N \u03c7 E1\nnph (t) = \u03b10 \u2212\nIm(Y(t))\n \u0303 + i\u03ba\nEs\n\u2206\n2\nqc\n(S20)\n+ npr (t)e\u2212i(\u03b4t+\u03c6) .\n= 4\u03b7 2 npr,0 N \u03c7\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\nThe second term in nph (t) describes the pump field which\nwas Bragg scattered off the excited density modulation\ninto the cavity mode. From N1 , the population Ne in\nthe momentum state |ei is obtained according to Ne =\n\u03b6N1 , where \u03b6 denotes the absolute square of the Fourier\namplitude of the excited Bogoliubov mode u1 + v1 at\nmomenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k).\nThe curves shown in Fig. 2C and D of the main\ntext are obtained from Eqs. (3), where the phase \u03c6\nwas adjusted to fit the data in Fig. 2C. The resonance\ncurves, displayed in Fig. 2B and E of the main text,\ncorrespond to phase-averaged values hNe (\u03c4 )i\u03c6\u2208[0,2\u03c0] and\nR\u03c4\nh 0 dt nph (t)/\u03c4 i\u03c6\u2208[0,2\u03c0] where the resonance frequency\n\u03c9s and the amplitude \u03b7 2 N \u03c7 were adjusted independently\nto fit the data. Due to the detection background an offset\nwas added to Ne (\u03c4 ). The standard deviation of fluctuations associated with the uncontrolled relative phase \u03c6 is\ndisplayed by the shadings in Fig. 2B and E of the main\ntext.\nResponse in atomic density and momentum state\npopulation\n\nBragg spectroscopy, as described by the density perturbation \u0124pr , induces a response in the atomic density and\nin the population of the excited state. Normalized to the\nintegrated amplitude of the perturbation, this density response is a measure for the susceptibility of the system\non an external density perturbation and provides at zero\ntemperature a direct link to the static structure factor\n[38, 40]. We use the recorded modulation h\u03b4\u00e2i of the\nintracavity field to quantify the density response h\u03b4 \u03c1\u0302i of\nthe system.\n\u2020\nConsider the density operator \u03c1\u0302(r) = \u03a8\u0302\u221a\n(r)\u03a8\u0302(r) and\n2\nits linear expansion \u03c1\u0302 = \u03c10 + \u03b4 \u03c1\u0302 = N |\u03c80 | + N \u03c80 (\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302\u2020 +\n\n\u03b4 \u03a8\u0302) around the equilibrium value \u03c10 = h\u03c1\u0302i. In terms of\nthe densityR fluctuation operator in Fourier space, defined\nas \u03b4 \u03c1\u0302k = d3 r e\u2212ikr \u03b4 \u03c1\u0302(r), the fluctuations of the order\nand bunching parameter \u03b4 \u0398\u0302 and \u03b4 B\u0302 read\nX\nX\n\u03b4 \u0398\u0302 =\n\u03b4 \u03c1\u0302k /4\nand\n\u03b4 B\u0302 =\n\u03b4 \u03c1\u0302k /4 .\nk\u2208(\u00b1k,\u00b1k)\n\nk\u2208(\u00b12k,0)\n\nFluctuations of the cavity field \u03b4\u00e2, see Eq.

(3) (see Fig. 2E in the main text),\nwith experimentally calibrated |\u03b10 |2 and npr . In order to\nprobe the linear response of the system, the probe power\nwas accordingly lowered when approaching the critical\npoint. The lowest perturbation applied in the normal\nphase corresponds to 30(8) intracavity probe photons in\ntotal.\nSimilarly, the response function RN associated with\nthe detected number of atoms with momenta (\u00b1~k, \u00b1~k)\nis defined as\nZ \u221e\n1\nd\u03b4 hNe (\u03c4 )i\u03c6\u2208[0,2\u03c0] .\nRN = R \u03c4\nP 0 dt npr (t) \u2212\u221e\nwhich is proportional to the area below the fitted resonances of Ne (\u03c4 ), see Fig. 2B in the main text.\nThe dominant scaling factor of R\u03c1 when approaching\nthe critical point is found from Eq. (3) to be (E1 /Es )2 .\nAs R\u03c1 measures the quadratic density response, this is\nin agreement with Feynman's relation, given in the main\ntext. Since Ne (\u03c4 ) is sensitive to both quadratures of \u01091\n(see Eq. (3)), the response function RN scales differently\nand exhibits larger variances in the relative phase \u03c6.\n\n\u2217\n\nesslinger@phys.ethz.ch\n[31] O. Morsch, M. Oberthaler, Rev. Mod.
