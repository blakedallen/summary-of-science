Magnetic nano-structures and quasione dimensional semiconductor rings have been acknowledged as ideal candidates for testing the effects of quantum coherence in low dimensions, and have been extensively investigated to test their potential as new generation quantum devices mentioned above8,9 .\nSpin-orbit interaction (SOI) in semiconductors is a central mechanism that determines the essential physics in\nthe meso- and nano-scales, and is largely responsible for\nthe prospect of semiconducting structures as potential\nquantum devices. Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI)\nand the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (DSOI) are the\ntwo typical spin-orbit interactions that one encounters in\na conventional semiconductor.\nThe Rashba spin-orbit field in a solid is attributed\nto an electric field that originates from a structural inversion asymmetry whereas, the Dresselhaus interaction\ncomes from bulk inversion asymmetry10 . Quantum rings\nformed at the interface of two semiconducting materials are ideal candidates to unravel the interplay of the\ntwo kinds of SOI. A quantum ring in a heterojunction,\nformed by trapping a two-dimensional gas of electrons in\na quantum well, generates a band offset at the interface\nof two different semiconducting materials. This creates\nan electric field. This electric field is described by a potential gradient normal to the interface11 . The potential\nat the interface is asymmetric, leading to the presence of\na RSOI. On the other hand, at such interfaces, the bulk\ninversion symmetry is naturally broken, and DSOI plays\nits part.\nNeedless to say, an accurate estimation of the SOI's is\ncrucial in the field of spintronics. The RSOI can be controlled by a gate voltage placed in the vicinity of the sample9\u201313 . Thus, in principle, all possible values of the RSOI\ncan be achieved. Measurement of RSOI has already been\nreported in the literature14 . Comparatively speaking, reports on the techniques of measurement of the DSOI are\n\nrelatively few, and are mainly based on an optical monitoring of the spin precession of the electrons10,15 , measurement of electrical conductance of nano-wires16,17 , or\nphoto-galvanic methods18 .\nIn the present communication we propose a method to\nmeasure the strengths of both the RSOI and DSOI by\nmeasuring the spin current flowing through a single sample. An important issue, while the measurement of a spin\ncurrent in a mesoscopic system is concerned, is the non-\n\n\u03b3\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online). Schematic view of a mesoscopic ring\nwhere a section of the ring (shaded region measured by the\nangle \u03b3) is subjected to SOI, while the other section is free\nfrom the SOI.\n\nconservation of spin caused by the ubiquitous presence\nof the spin-orbit coupling. A proper definition of spin\ncurrent is therefore urgent19 and, its measurement in a\nsample is challenging. It has only recently been possible,\nusing a novel version of the Doppler effect, to quantify the\nspin current in a ferromagnetic wire20 , and by using spin\nrelaxation modulation induced by spin injection21,22 .\nInspired by the success in the measurement of spin\ncurrent we provide a completely analytical scheme that\nimmediately suggests an experiment to measure the\nstrengths of either RSOI or the DSOI in the same sample. Our system is a mesoscopic ring grafted at a heterojunction, but in such a manner that the spin-orbit\ninteraction is effective only in a fraction of the perimeter\nof the ring (see Fig. 1). The spin current should be measured in the SO interaction-free region where the spin\nflip scattering is absent. One thus need not worry about\nthe non-conservation of spin and the spin current in any\n'bond' in the non-shaded region in Fig. 1 is the same,\nand becomes a well defined quantity.\n\n\f2\nIn this letter we prove that, in such a mesoscopic ring\nthe spin current will be zero whenever the strengths of\nthe RSOI and the DSOI are equal. As we have already\nmentioned above, the RSOI strength can in principle, be\nsmoothly varied with applied gate voltage. This leads\nto the idea of estimating the strength of the DSOI if we\nhappen to know a measured value of the RSOI. The idea\nis as follows. We devise a unitary transformation that\nacts on the full Hamiltonian of the system to extract a\nsubtle symmetry that is finally exploited to achieve the\nresult. Incidentally, similar kind of symmetry has previously been reported in literature23\u201325 . In this work we\nhave focused on the effect of the symmetry on the spin\ncurrent for a system in the presence of both the Rashba\nand the Dresselhaus interactions. Our result is analytically exact, and is true for any value of the spin-orbit\ninteractions. It should therefore be observable in a suitably designed experiment. In addition, we numerically\ncalculate the persistent spin current in the system, and\ndetermine its dependence on the length of the sample involving the SOI (determined by the angle \u03b3 in Fig. 1).\nThe numerical results corroborate our analytical work,\nand remain robust even in the presence of disorder.\n\u2022 Analytical treatment for the determination of\nSOI strengths: Let us refer to Fig. 1. Only the bold\nportion of the arc contains the spin-orbit interactions.\nWithin a tight-binding framework the Hamiltonian for\nsuch a ring reads,\nH = H0 \u2212 i\u03b1HRSO + i\u03b2HDSO\n\n(1)\n\nthe creation (annihilation) operator of an electron at the\nsite n with spin \u03c3 (\u2191, \u2193). The form of the Hamiltonian\nwritten in the case of a ring is discussed elsewhere26 .\nWe now define a transformation,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c3x +\u03c3y\n\u221a\nU = \u03c3z\n(4)\n2\nwhich, by definition is unitary. It is simple to verify that,\nU \u03c3x U \u2020 = \u2212\u03c3y ; U \u03c3y U \u2020 = \u2212\u03c3x ; U \u03c3z U \u2020 = \u2212\u03c3z . (5)\nUsing the operator defined in Eq. 4 we now make a change\nof basis and describe the full Hamiltonian in terms of the\noperators c\u0303n = U cn , and c\u0303\u2020n = c\u2020n U \u2020 . The Hamiltonian\nin the new basis reads,\nH\u0303 = H\u03030 \u2212 i\u03b2 H\u0303RSO + i\u03b1H\u0303DSO\n\n(6)\n\nwhere,\nH\u03030 =\n\nX\n\nc\u0303\u2020n \u01ebn c\u0303n +\n\nn\n\nX\u0010\n\nc\u0303\u2020n+1 tc\u0303n + h.c.\n\nn\n\n\u0011\n\n(7)\n\nand, the spin-orbit parts of the Hamiltonian in this new\nbasis are given by,\nX\nc\u0303\u2020n \u03c3x cos \u03c6n,n+1 c\u0303n+1\nH\u0303RSO =\n+\nH\u0303DSO =\n\nn\nc\u0303\u2020n \u03c3y\n\nX\n\nsin \u03c6n,n+1 c\u0303n+1 + h.c.\n\nc\u0303\u2020n \u03c3y cos \u03c6n,n+1 c\u0303n+1\n\n\u0001\n\nn\n\nwhere,\nH0 =\n\nX\n\nc\u2020n \u01ebn cn\n\n+\n\nn\n\nX\u0010\n\nc\u2020n+1 tcn\n\n\u0011\n\n+ h.c. .\n\nn\n\n(2)\n\nThe Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit parts of the\nHamiltonian, viz, HRSO and HDSO , are given by,\nX\nHRSO =\nc\u2020n \u03c3x cos \u03c6n,n+1 cn+1\nn\n\nHDSO\n\n+ c\u2020n \u03c3y sin \u03c6n,n+1 cn+1 + h.c.\nX\n=\nc\u2020n \u03c3y cos \u03c6n,n+1 cn+1\n+\n\nn\nc\u2020n \u03c3x\n\n\u0001\n\nsin \u03c6n,n+1 cn+1 + h.c.\n\n\u0001\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, n = 1, 2, . . . , N is the site index along the\nazimuthal direction \u03c6 of the ring. The other factors in\nEq. 3\u0012are as\n\u0013\n\u0013 follows.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncn\u2191\n\u01ebn\u2191 0\n1 0\n.\ncn =\n; \u01ebn =\n; t=t\ncn\u2193\n0 \u01ebn\u2193\n0 1\nHere \u01ebn\u03c3 is the site energy of an electron at the\nn-th site of the ring with spin \u03c3 (\u2191, \u2193). t is the nearestneighbor hopping integral. \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the isotropic\nnearest-neighbor transfer integrals which measure the\nstrengths of Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI, respectively,\nand \u03c6n,n+1 = (\u03c6n + \u03c6n+1 ) /2, where \u03c6n = 2\u03c0(n \u2212 1)/N .\n\u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z are the Pauli spin matrices. c\u2020n\u03c3 (cn\u03c3 ) is\n\n\u0001\n+ c\u0303\u2020n \u03c3x sin \u03c6n,n+1 c\u0303n+1 + h.c. .\n\n(8)\n\nA simultaneous look at the Eqs. 6 and 8 reveal that in\nthe new basis, the strengths of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions viz, \u03b1 and \u03b2 have been\ninterchanged. As a consequence, the polarized spin current operator in the quantized direction (+Z), for the\nfree region, defined as Jsz = 21 (\u03c3z \u1e8b + \u1e8b\u03c3z ) flips its sense\nP \u2020\nof circulation, and becomes \u2212Jsz . Here, x=\nncn cn .\nThis immediately leads to the most important observation that, as soon as \u03b1 = \u03b2, H and H\u0303 become identical.\nThat is, the full Hamiltonian remains invariant under\nthe unitary transformation defined by Eq. 4 whenever\nthe strengths of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus spinorbit interactions become equal. The energy eigenvalues\nobviously remain unchanged in this case.\nAt the same time, from the last equation in Eq. 5 we see\nthat U \u03c3z U \u2020 = \u2212\u03c3z which means that, the spin current\nJsz calculated in the original basis becomes exactly equal\nto the spin current \u2212Jsz calculated in the new basis. This\ncan happen only when Jsz = 0 as \u03b1 = \u03b2. The RSOI can\nbe controlled by a gate voltage, and hence its strength\nis determined. So, an experiment on the measurement\nof spin current in a mesoscopic ring, where the RSOI is\ncontinuously varied, will show a complete disappearance\nof the spin current as soon as the strength of the DSOI\nbecomes equal to that of the RSOI. We thus have a means\n\n\f3\nof determining DSOI from a measurement of the spin\ncurrent. The spin current, however, as stated earlier, is\nto be measured in that region of the ring which is free\nfrom the spin-orbit coupling.\nNeedless to say, the strength of the Rashba interaction\ncan be obtained by the same method, if we know the\nDresselhaus interaction beforehand.\n\u2022 Calculation of persistent spin current: In the second quantized form the spin current operator Jsz for the\nfree region can be written as,\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n(9)\nc\u2020n \u03c3z cn+1 \u2212 c\u2020n+1 \u03c3z cn .\nJsz = 2i\u03c0t\nn\n\nTherefore, for a particular eigenstate |\u03c8k i the persistent spin current becomes, Jsz,k = h\u03c8k |Jsz |\u03c8k i, where\nP k\n|\u03c8k i =\nap,\u2191 |p \u2191i + akp,\u2193 |p \u2193i. Here |p \u2191i's and |p \u2193i's\n\nWe measure spin current in the region which is free\nfrom the SOI, and, since the spin currents between any\ntwo neighboring sites in this interacting free region are\nidentical to each other we compute the current only in a\nsingle bond.\nIn the present work we compute all the essential features of persistent spin current and related issues at\nabsolute zero temperature and choose the units where\nc = h = e = 1. Throughout our numerical work we fix\nt = 1 and measure the energy scale in unit of t.\n\u2022 Numerical results: In Fig. 2, we present the variation\nof the spin current as a function of the RSOI and the\nDSOI for a 40-site ordered half-filled ring.

(10)\n\nn\n\nLet us rename the polarized spin current Jsz,k as Jsk for\nthe sake of simplicity. At absolute zero temperature\n(T = 0 k), net persistent spin current in a mesoscopic\nring for a particular filling can be obtained by taking\nthe sum of individual contributions from the energy levels with energies less than or equal to Fermi energy EF .\nTherefore, for Ne electron system total spin current bePN\ncomes Js = k e Jsk .\n\nthe RSOI and the DSOI are present respectively. The\nRSOI and the DSOI drive the spin current in opposite\ndirections (with equal magnitudes when \u03b1 = \u03b2), as is\nevident from the figure.\nFigure 3 shows the variation of the spin current as a\nfunction of the strength of the RSOI, plotted for various\nvalues of the strength of the DSOI. This figure is a clear\ndemonstration of the fact that, whenever the strength of\nthe DSOI becomes equal to that of the RSOI, the spin\ncurrent becomes zero. We again emphasize that, the vanishing of the persistent spin current will be observed for\n\n\f4\nany strength of the RSOI, provided it equals the DSOI\nstrength. Hence, it is expected to be observed in experiments as well. The region of the mesoscopic ring in which\nthe SOI is 'on', plays an important role in determining\nthe strength of the spin current in the system. To get\nan idea, we systematically study the variation of Js as a\nfunction of \u03b3 with the DSOI \u03b2 = 0. For a given value of\nthe angle \u03b3, the current increases with increasing values\nof the RSOI strength \u03b1 (see Fig. 4).\nFinally, in view of a possible experiment, we test the\nrobustness of our results by considering a 40-site disordered ring.

Since\nH0 remains invariant under the unitary transformation\ndefined by Eq. 4, all the qualitative results should remain\nunchanged even in the presence of disorder. However, the\ndisorder will reduce the amplitude of the spin current.\nThis is precisely what we find in our numerical analysis.\nThe current still becomes zero as soon as \u03b1 = \u03b2. This observation strengthens our claim that a suitably designed\nexperiment on the measurement of the spin current will\nlead to an exciting method of measurement of the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction from a knowledge of the\ngate controlled Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a meso-\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\nElectronic address: santanu@post.tau.ac.il\nI.

The spin current, as obtained from the\ntheoretical calculations already existing in the literature\nas well as from the present calculation, is a robust phenomenon undisturbed by the presence of disorder. Determination of spin current is also very much possible,\nand already a few experiments have been carried out in\nthis direction27\u201330 . For example, by studying the Kerr effect27\u201329 associated with spin accumulations induced by\nthe spin current or by investigating the reciprocal spin\nHall effect30 persistent spin current can be detected. It\nis also well known that a spin current may produce a\nspin torque which can be measured experimentally31\u201333 .\nThis definitely provides a way of estimating the spin current. Probably a more convenient way of detecting persistent spin current is the measurement of the electric field\nand electric potential induced by it34\u201338 . This is quite\nanalogous to the detection of persistent charge current\nin a mesoscopic ring by measuring its induced magnetic\nfield39,40 . We can also measure the strengths of spinorbit interactions by attaching two electrodes in a mesoscopic ring. In that case also the persistent spin current\nas well as the transport spin current have well defined\nexpressions and simply by measuring the transport spin\ncurrent we can have an estimate of the SO interaction\nstrengths. These latter observations are the major issues\nof our forthcoming paper.\nIn conclusion, we present an exact analytical method\nwhich shows that the strengths of the Rashba or the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit interactions can be determined in\na single mesoscopic ring by noting the vanishing of the\nspin current in the sample. A unitary transformation is\nprescribed, which when applied to the spin-orbit Hamiltonian brings out a hidden symmetry. The symmetry is\nexploited to prove that, by making the strengths of the\ntwo interactions equal, one achieves a zero spin current in\nthe system. We provide numerical results which support\nall our analytical findings, and show that the vanishing\nof the spin current is a robust effect even in the presence\nof disorder. This last observation gives us confidence to\npropose an experiment in this line.\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA. Aharony, O. E.-Wohlman, Y. Tokura, and S.
