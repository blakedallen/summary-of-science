Introduction\nRadio observations of a wide variety of astrophysical bodies (the\nSun, spiral galaxies, the Earth) show that a magnetic field is\nusually present (see Priest & Forbes 2000, for review). These\nmagnetic fields have significant large scale components, i.e on\nthe scale of the objects themselves. The origin of these fields is\ntypically ascribed to the operation of a large scale magnetohydrodynamic dynamo (Ruzmaikin et al. 1988; Parker 1979, 1992;\nHanasz et al. 2004; Lazarian & Vishniac 2008). Since dynamo\ntheory involves the twisting and folding of field lines it is important that there is some process which can lead to efficient\nsmoothing of the small scale components of the field. In other\nwords, we need to invoke some kind of fast local magnetic diffusion. In spite of the fact that astrophysical fluids are turbulent\n(see Armstrong et al. 1995; Horbury & Balogh 2001; Elmegreen\n& Scalo 2004; McKee & Ostriker 2007), the concept of turbulent magnetic diffusivity (see Blackman & Field 2008), a popular heuristic concept used in early dynamo work, is known to be\nill founded (Cattaneo & Vainshtein 1991; Gruzinov & Diamond\n1994; Vainshtein & Cattaneo 1992). In particular, it does not address the key question of how intersecting magnetic fluxes can\nchange their topology. In an ionized plasma, Ohmic diffusivity\nfails by many orders of magnitude to supply the required magnetic diffusion.\nIn order for astrophysical dynamos to function smoothly\nthere must be a process which allows reconnection to proceed\nat speeds characteristic of local dynamical velocities. Since rms\nfluid velocities are often comparable to the local Alfv\u00e9n speed,\nin practice this requirement is indistinguishable from Vrec \u223c VA .\nThis is called fast reconnection, meaning that it does not depend\non resistivity or depends on the resistivity logarithmically (see\nParker 1979). There is also direct evidence for fast reconnection\nfrom studies of solar flares (Yokoyama & Shibata 1995; Innes et\nal. 1997; Pagano et al. 2008).\nSend offprint requests to: K. Kulpa-Dybel\nCorrespondence to: kulpa@oa.uj.edu.pl\n\nThe idea that there could be some way of producing fast\nmagnetic reconnection even in highly conducting fluids is not\nnew (Moffat 1978; Krause & Radler 1980), but early models of\nreconnection (see Parker 1957; Sweet 1958, e.g.) using realistic\nastrophysical temperatures and densities gave a very slow reconnection rate, \u223c VA S \u22121/2 , where S \u2261 \u03b7/(VA L) is the Lundquist\nnumber, \u03b7 is the resistivity, and L is the size of the current\nsheet. It was Petschek (1964) who for the first time introduced a\nmodel for fast reconnection with a rate proportional to (log S )\u22121 .\nSubsequent numerical simulations and theoretical analyses have\nshown that the Petschek reconnection rate is only attainable in\nvery restricted circumstances. For instance, a modified version\ncan stably persist in a collisionless plasma (see Drake et al.\n2006a, e.g.). This means that the length of the current sheet\nshould not exceed approximately 50 electron mean free paths\n(Uzdensky 2006; Yamada et al. 2006). This condition cannot\nbe satisfied in many astrophysical environments, e.g. in the interstellar medium (Vishniac & Lazarian 1999). In a collisional\nplasma the X-point region required for Petschek reconnection\nwill collapse to the Sweet-Parker geometry for large S (Biskamp\n1996).\nThe failure of the Petschek model has increased interest in\nthe role of turbulence in reconnection. This interest has been\nfurther stimulated by the fact that the turbulence is ubiquitous in\nastrophysical environments where reconnection occurs, e.g. the\nISM, stars, the Sun and accretion disks (Ruzmaikin et al. 1988).\nThe idea that turbulence can affect reconnection has a long history, although usually studied in two-dimensions (2D) (Priest &\nForbes 2000). Several researchers have approached this problem numerically, e.g. Matthaeus & Lamkin (1985, 1986); Fan et\nal. (2004, 2005); Servidio et al. (2009); Loureiro et al. (2009).\nThey found that it was possible to get many features expected\nfrom reconnection theory, i.e. large and small-scale magnetic islands, fluid jetting, current filamentation and that the maximum\nreconnection speed was higher for more powerful turbulence and\nexceeded the Sweet-Parker rate (Fan et al. 2004, 2005).\nThe most interesting result of their calculations (Fan et al.\n2004, 2005) was that under the influence of turbulence they ob-\n\n\f2\n\nK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\nserved a two-step process of magnetic reconnection: beginning\nwith a slow Sweet-Parker mechanism and changing later to a\nfaster reconnection state that they identified with the Petscheck\nprocess. In a similar manner, the most recent paper (Loureiro\net al. 2009) also observed that the presence of turbulence significantly enhances the reconnection rate. They also found that\nfor a given value of diffusion and above a critical value of the\nturbulent injection power the reconnection process accelerates\nsubstantially. However, in all these simulations the authors used\nperiodic boundary conditions, which prevents inflow or outflow\nand conserves the total magnetic flux. This made the actual reconnection rates difficult to evaluate. In particular, it was impossible to calculate the average reconnection rate, which is important in view of the large fluctuations induced by turbulence. In\naddition, one can argue that the reconnection rate in these simulations is influenced by the conservation of the total magnetic\nhelicity (Blackman 2000). These difficulties can be avoided by\nusing boundary conditions that allow the inflow and outflow of\nplasma and magnetic flux (Kowal et al. 2009).\nMore recently interest in the magnetic reconnection process\nhas moved from 2D magnetic configurations to more realistic\nand generic three-dimensional ones. In particular, Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) (LV99) and Lazarian & Vishniac (2000) proposed that in three dimensions a stochastic magnetic field component can dramatically enhance reconnection rates, leading to\nreconnection speeds comparable to the local turbulent velocity.\nTheir model is based on the Sweet-Parker reconnection scheme,\nwith a long narrow current sheet between two regions of dramatically different polarizations but similarly strong magnetic\nfields, but includes the effects of turbulence and substructure in\nthe magnetic field. This has two principal effects. First, in three\ndimensions many independent patches of magnetic field come\ninto contact with the current sheet and undergo reconnection.\nSecond, the outflow of plasma and shared magnetic flux happens\nnot over a microscopically narrow region determined by Ohmic\ndiffusion, but through a substantially wider region determined\nby field wandering. Neither effect is present in two dimensions,\nalthough the formation of magnetic islands in two dimensions is\nroughly similar to the broadening of the outflow. Together these\neffects are sufficient to trigger fast magnetic reconnection. In this\nmodel the reconnection rate does not depend on the Ohmic resistivity, but is determined only by turbulence, in particular by\nits strength and injection scale. This fast reconnection model\nhas been tested numerically by Kowal et al. (2009) using inflow/outflow boundary conditions and using a wide range of injection scales and power for the turbulence. These simulations\nhave confirmed all of the predicted features of the LV99 model,\nincluding the insensitivity to the Lundquist number.\nIn this paper we return to two dimensional reconnection using the same inflow/outflow boundary conditions. We have two\nobjectives in this work. First, since the explanation for fast reconnection advanced in LV99 was intrinsically three dimensional, we are interested in examining the effects of dimensionality on the reconnection rate. Second, this work constitutes an\nexamination of the importance of boundary conditions on the\ntwo dimensional model and a test of claims for fast reconnection\nin two dimensions. Our numerical model of turbulent reconnection in the ISM is calculated in a 2D box with open boundary\nconditions. We use a Harris current sheet setup as an initial configuration. Reconnection develops as a result of an initial vector\npotential perturbation. We do not drive reconnection. We solve\n2D non-ideal normalized isothermal MHD equations numerically while varying the power and scale of turbulence, and the\nmagnetic resistivity (Kowal et al. 2009).\n\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe\nthe numerical setup and input parameters, and we present our\nmethod to measure the reconnection rate. The results are discussed in Sect. 3, where we analyse the time evolution of models with different power of injecting turbulence. We present the\ndependencies of the reconnection rate on: power of turbulence,\ninjection scale, viscosity as well as uniform and anomalous resistivities. We also check the influence of initial magnetic field\nconfiguration, boundary conditions and method of driving turbulence. We discuss our results in Sect. 4 and give our conclusions\nin Sect. 5.\n\n2. Methods\n2.1. Basic Equations\n\nWe study the problem of magnetic reconnection in the presence\nof weak turbulence using the magnetized fluid approximation\ngoverned by the isothermal non-ideal MHD equations of the\nform:\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1v) = 0,\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1v\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1vv + P\u2217 I \u2212 BB) = f + \u03bd\u2206v,\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202A\n= v \u00d7 B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207 \u00d7 B,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the gas density, v is the fluid velocity, A is the\nmagnetic vector potential, B \u2261 \u2207 \u00d7 A is the magnetic field,\nP\u2217 = c2s \u03c1+B2 /8\u03c0 is the total pressure, I is the Kronecker delta, c s\nis the isothermal speed of sound, \u03b7 is the resistivity coefficient,\n\u03bd is the viscosity, f = \u03c1a represents the forcing term, and a is a\nrandom acceleration.\nWe solve the MHD equations using the same code as in\nKowal et al. (2009) based on the following methods: a higherorder shock-capturing Godunov-type scheme, the essentially\nnon oscillatory (ENO) spatial reconstruction (see Londrillo &\nDel Zanna 2000; Del Zanna et al. 2003), a multi-state HartenLax-van Leer (HLLD) approximate Riemann solver for isothermal MHD equations (Mignone 2007) and Runge-Kutta (RK)\ntime integration (see Del Zanna et al. 2003, e.g.). The choice of\nHLLD Riemann solver guarantees a good solution for the Alfv\u00e9n\nwave propagation, which is important in our model, since most\nof the kinetic energy is transported through Alfv\u00e9n waves (see\nKowal et al. 2009). The divergence of the magnetic field must\nbe kept zero everywhere at all times (\u2207 * B = 0). To satisfy this\ncondition the field interpolated constraint transport (CT) scheme\nbased on the staggered grid is used (see Londrillo & Del Zanna\n2000, e.g.).\nSome selected simulations that we perform include anomalous resistivity modeled as\n\u03b7 = \u03b7u + \u03b7a\n\n!\n!\n|j|\n|j|\n\u22121 H\n,\njcrit\njcrit\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7u and \u03b7a describe uniform and anomalous resistivity coefficients, respectively, jcrit is the critical level of the absolute\nvalue of current density above which the anomalous effects start\nto work, and H is a step function. However, for most of our simulations \u03b7a = 0.\n\n\fK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\n3\n\nof the normal component is set to zero. This guarantees that all\nwaves generated in the system are free to leave the box without\nsignificant reflections. For a more detailed description of these\nboundary conditions, including their advantages and drawbacks,\nwe refer the reader to Kowal et al. (2009).\n2.3. Model of Turbulence\n\nFig. 1. 2D magnetic field configuration in our problem. The grey\narea describes the diffusion region where the incoming field lines\nreconnect. The longitudinal and transverse scales of the diffusion\nregion are described by the parameters \u2206 and \u03b4, respectively. We\nuse inflow and outflow boundary conditions at X and Y directions, respectively.\n\n2.2. Initial and Boundary Conditions\n\nWe numerically investigate the turbulent magnetic reconnection\nmodel in 2D in a computational box of size L x \u00d7 Ly , where\nL x = 1 and Ly = 2 with a spatial resolution of 1024\u00d7 2048\ngrid zones in the x and y directions, respectively. Figure 1\nshows a 2D visualization of the reconnection problem setup.\nThe domain contains two regions of oppositely directed magnetic lines separated by a diffusion region with a thickness \u03b4 and\na length \u2206, where the magnetic lines reconnect and the product of this process is ejected along the X direction with a speed\nVout (see Figure 1). The initial magnetic field configuration is\ndescribed by a Harris current sheet Bx (x, y) = Bx0 tanh(y/\u03b8),\nwhere Bx0 is the initial strength of the anti-parallel magnetic\nfield component. The Sweet-Parker reconnection is triggered by\na small initial perturbation of the vector potential \u03b4A(x, y) =\n\u03b4B0 cos(2\u03c0x) exp[\u2212(y/d)2 ], where d and \u03b4B0 denote the thickness of the perturbed region and the strength of the initial perturbation, respectively. The initial setup is completed by setting\nthe density profile from the condition of the uniform total pressure P\u2217 (t = 0, x, y) = const and setting the initial velocity to zero\neverywhere.\nThe code (Kowal et al. 2009) uses dimensionless units. The\nvelocity and magnetic field are expressed\nin units of the char\u221a\nacteristic Alfv\u00e9n speed VA \u2261 |Bx0 |/ \u03c10 , where the initial antiparallel component of magnetic field Bx0 = 1 and the density\n\u03c10 = 1 far from the diffusion region so that VA = 1 far from\nthe diffusion region in all models. Time is measured in units of\nthe Alfv\u00e9n transit time tA \u2261 1/VA . The speed of sound is set to\nc s = 4 (the plasma \u03b2 \u2261 p/pmag is 32.0 for all models). We vary\nthe resistivity coefficient \u03b7u between values 3 * 10\u22124 and 5 * 10\u22123\n(in dimensionless units). In the models which include anomalous\neffects, we vary the anomalous resistivity coefficient \u03b7a between\n0.0 and 3 * 10\u22123 . The parameters describing the initial perturbation are set to \u03b4B0 = 0.05 and d = 0.1.\nWe use outflow boundary conditions along the X direction\nand inflow boundary conditions along the Y direction setting the\nnormal derivatives of the fluid variables (density and momentum) to zero. In the treatment of vector potential A at the boundary we set its components transverse to the considered boundary\nusing the first order extrapolation, while the normal derivative\n\nIn order to drive turbulence in our model we follow Kowal et al.\n(2009) and use the method proposed by Alvelius (1999). The\nforcing is driven across a specified distribution of wave vectors.\nHere we use a Gaussian profile around a shell in Fourier space\nwith a radius which determines the injection scale lin j . The forcing is random in time, and therefore is uncorrelated with any of\nthe time scales of the turbulent flow. For the same reason the\npower input is defined purely by the force-velocity correlation.\nThe driving is completely solenoidal and does not directly produce density fluctuations.\nTurbulence is introduced at a given injection scale and grows\ngradually in time until it reaches the desired amplitude corresponding to the turbulent power Pin j . We drive turbulence to\nits saturation level over one Alfv\u00e9nic time from tbeg = 9 to\ntend = 10. According to the LV99 model, the injection scale and\nturbulent power determine the rate of reconnection in 3D. Thus,\nin our model we test this correlation in 2D by changing these\nproperties of turbulence.\n2.4. Input Parameters\n\nOur simulations can be divided into five groups. In each of them\nwe analyze the dependence of the reconnection rate by changing\nonly one of the crucial parameters: for models PD - the power of\nturbulence Pin j , for models SD - the injection wavenumber k f ,\nfor models VD - viscosity \u03bd, for models RD and AD the uniform\n\u03b7u and anomalous \u03b7a resistivities, respectively. In Table 1 we list\nparameters of all the models presented in this paper.\nAmong all parameters of the model we list those which vary,\ni.e. the uniform and anomalous resistivities, \u03b7u and \u03b7a , respectively, the uniform viscosity \u03bd, the power of turbulence Pin j and\nits injection wavenumber kin j with the half-thickness of the injection shell \u2206kin j , the number of perturbed Fourier components\nof velocity N f and the amplitude of perturbation \u1e7d f at the injection scale. In addition, we include the mean velocity amplitude\nobtained at the end of each simulation.\n2.5. Reconnection Rate Measure\n\nIn the case of laminar reconnection (Sweet-Parker and Petschek)\nits rate can be measured by averaging the inflow velocity Vin\ndivided by the Alfv\u00e9n speed VA over the inflow boundaries, i.e.\n!\nZ\nvy\nvy\n1 xmax\nhVin /VA i =\ndx\n\u2212\n.\n(5)\n2 xmin\nVA y=ymin VA y=ymax\nSince we have two X boundaries, located at y = ymin and\ny = ymax , we need to take half of the resulting integral. This\nmeasure works well for laminar reconnection, when the system\nis perfectly stable and where the time derivative of the magnetic\nflux is zero. In the presence of turbulence, however, this time\nderivative can fluctuate or the turbulence in the center of the box\ncould affect the flow of the plasma. In this way we would get a\nflow of magnetic flux without the presence of reconnection. In\norder to include all effects contributing to the change of magnetic\nflux, we use a new more general measure of the reconnection rate\n\n\f4\n\nK.

As expected the highest values of the current\ndensity appear in the midplane and determine the diffusion region. The state of Sweet-Parker reconnection described above is\nstationary and sufficient to study the influence of turbulence on\nthe reconnection process.\n3.2. Reconnection in the Presence of Turbulence\n\nFig. 3. Time variation evolution of the reconnection rate during\nthe Sweet-Parker stage with the uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 .\n\nmentioned above we start our simulations with a configuration\nof the oppositely directed initial magnetic fields with a small\nmagnetic perturbation. The perturbation initiates Sweet-Parker\nreconnection which reaches a stationary state in a few Alf\u00e9n time\nunits which lasts until we start injecting turbulence.\nWe assume that we get the steady state of Sweet-Parker reconnection when the total mass, reconnection rate, kinetic and\nmagnetic energies show very small time derivatives. Figure 2\nshows the evolution of mass, kinetic and magnetic energy during the laminar reconnection stage. In the beginning all these\nquantities change slightly but then reach almost constant values.\nThe reconnection rate (Figure 3) initially increases until t \u223c 1.3,\nwhen it starts to oscillate, finally stabilizing after a few time\nunits.\nFigure 4 shows the topology of the velocity (left panel) and\nmagnetic fields (middle panel), and the absolute value of the\ncurrent density (right panel) just before we start injecting turbulence. The brighter shades correspond to large values of the\ndisplayed quantities. The velocity field and magnetic field are\nshown in the form of texture. The initial oppositely directed\nmagnetic field lines are transported to the middle of the box.\nThe Y-component of magnetic field emerges from the current\nsheet and is ejected near the midplane through the left and right\nboundaries. The reconnection process in the diffusion region and\nthe ejection of By cause the strong outflow of gas which is clearly\n\nIn this section we present the influence of turbulence on the reconnection process. Turbulence is injected at time t = 9 and\nat a given injection scale lin j \u221d k\u22121\nf in the vicinity of the midplane. We gradually increase the strength of turbulence during\none Alfv\u00e9n time, thus at time t = 10 the power reaches its input\nvalue defined by Pin j .\nFigure 5 shows the reconnection rate obtained for a model\nwith uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 , a turbulent power Pin j =\n0.1 and an injection wavenumber k f = 12. Adding turbulence to\nthe system results in slight fluctuations of the reconnection rate\nuntil t = 11.5. Next, the reconnection rate increases significantly\nuntil it reaches the maximum at time t \u223c 13 and then drops. We\ncan distinguish four such maxima, which are roughly separated\nby two Alfv\u00e9n times (t \u223c 13, t \u223c 15, t \u223c 17, t \u223c 19). In Figure 5\nwe mark three time steps corresponding to the same time stages\nshown in Figure 6, where we plot the current density, magnetic\nand gas velocity fields.\nIn Figure 6 (top and middle row) we see that the structure\nof the magnetic and velocity fields are considerably different\nthan in the case of Sweet-Parker reconnection (see Figure 4).\nAt t1 = 12.15 (Figure 6, first column, top panel) we are injecting\nturbulence with the maximum power Pin j = 0.1 in a large volume surrounding the the midplane. Thus, in this region the velocity field is strongly perturbed and mixed. Although the topology of the velocity field is very complicated, we can distinguish\nthe main direction of the velocity fluctuations, which is parallel\nto the mean magnetic field.\nA smaller number of distinct features in the velocity field\nare pointed perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Close to\nthe midplane the magnetic field lines change their directions and\nare substantially reduced in strength. Thus, velocity fluctuations\n\n\f6\n\nK.

Brighter shades\ncorrespond to the larger values of the displayed quantities. All panels show the moment just before we start injecting turbulence.\ncan bend magnetic field lines in this region. Another noticeable\ndifference in comparison to the Sweet-Parker configuration is\na significant change of the current density distribution. Adding\nturbulence to the system creates a very complex configuration\nof the magnetic field, so that we observe multiple reconnection\nevents happening at the same time (Figure 6, t1 = 12.15, bottom\npanel).\nThe magnetic field configuration looks quite different at the\nnext time step t2 = 13.85 (Figure 6, second column, middle\npanel). In the vicinity of the midplane we observe the formation\nof a magnetic island. Also the velocity field (Figure 6, second\ncolumn, top panel) is more mixed in this region. However, the\noutflow velocity of the gas velocity is quite low, which is confirmed by the small reconnection rate (Figure 5).\nAs the simulation proceeds a large loop of magnetic field\nlines moves to the left boundary (Figure 6, t3 = 15.15, last column). This causes a powerful outflow of gas, which results in\na violent and rapid growth of the reconnection rate (Figure 5).\nWe see that the maxima of the velocity field associated with this\nloop are where the value of magnetic field is low. The area of the\nmagnetic island t2 = 13.85 and t3 = 15.15 is also well defined by\nthe current density distribution (Figure 6, bottom panel, middle\nand right column).\nFigure 7 shows the evolution of the reconnection speed for\nPin j = 0.5, five times larger than in the previous case. As before\nthe reconnection rate does not reach a stationary state. We observe a few maxima, however they do not appear periodically as\nin the previous case (Figure 5). In fact, we have two main well\ndefined maxima at times t \u223c 14.6 and t \u223c 19.5. The peak in the\nreconnection speed is again caused by a fast outflow of gas visible at time t1 = 13.90 in Figure 8 (first column, top panel). If we\nlook at the magnetic field topology at the same time (Figure 8\nfirst column, middle panel) we see a magnetic island which appears in the region of fast outflow.\nAt next time step (t2 = 15.70) the topology of magnetic and\nvelocity fields are still very mixed and complex (Figure 8, second column, top and middle panel), however the magnetic field\ndoes not exhibit the very strong bending seen in the previous\n\nFig. 7. The evolution of the reconnection speed for the model\nwith Pin j = 0.5, injection scale k f = 12 and uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 . Marked times correspond to those shown in\nFigure 8.\n\nstep. As the simulation proceeds the reconnection rate slowly decreases, reaching even slightly negative values1 (Figure 7, from\nt \u223c 16 to t \u223c 18.5).\nAt time step t3 = 18.15 (Figure 8, last column) we show how\nour model looks when the measured reconnection rate is negative. We can see a strong accumulation of the magnetic field\naround the midplane which extends over almost the whole computational domain. The region of velocity fluctuations is broadened in comparison to the previous time steps, even though the\nvolume within which we drive turbulence is unchanged. This\nquite unstable situation sets off the extreme growth of reconnection rate (from t \u223c 18.5 to t \u223c 19.5) shown in Figure 7. The current density distribution is plotted in the bottom row in Figure 8.\n1\n\nThis should not be taken too literally. Our measure of the reconnection speed is misleading when the midplane magnetic field topology\nbecomes progressively more tangled.\n\n\fK.

Dependence of the reconnection rate on the power of injected turbulence Pin j for models with and without turbulence,\nVrT B and VrS P , respectively. In all models we use the same values\nof the uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22125 and the injection scale\nkin j = 12. The error bars indicate the variance of the reconnection rate. In the case of Sweet-Parker reconnection (squares) the\nerrors are neglected and not shown.\nAt every time step many small reconnection events occur, as indicated by local growth of the current density.\n3.2.1. Dependence on the Strength of Turbulence\n\nIn order to check how the reconnection rate VtT B depends on the\nstrength of turbulence we make several simulations with different values of turbulent power Pin j (see model PD in Table 1). The\nrest of input parameters have the same value in all these models.\nIn Figure 9 we present the dependence of the averaged reconnection speed on the power of injected turbulence. Diamonds\nand squares correspond respectively to the reconnection rate\nwith and without turbulence. Both of them are averaged over\nthe fixed period of time: from t = 7 to t = 9 - laminar reconnection (Sweet-Parker stage) and from t = 10 to t = 20 - turbulent\nreconnection. The variance of the reconnection rate is calculated\nusing the standard deviation method. In case of the Sweet-Parker\nreconnection the variance is negligible and is not shown here.\nOn the other hand, in the presence of turbulence the reconnection rate undergoes continuous strong variations and the variance\nis only slightly smaller than the mean reconnection rate. We find\nthat the reconnection rate increases with power of turbulence and\nscales as \u223c P1/3\nin j .\n3.2.2. Dependence on the Injection Scale\n\nSimilarly we determine the dependence of the reconnection rate\nVrT B on the wavenumber at which we inject turbulence k f . We\ncompute several models with varying k f while keeping all other\nparameters the same (see model PD in Table 1).\nFigure 10 shows the resulting dependence. We can clearly\nsee the strong relation between injection scale k f and the reconnection speed. Namely, the reconnection rate and errors increase\nwith decreasing injection wavenumber k f . Fitting to the simula2/3\ntion results gives VrT B \u223c lin\nj.\n\n9\n\nFig. 10. Dependence of the reconnection rate on the injection\nscale lin j for models with and without turbulence, VrT B and VrS P ,\nrespectively. In all models we use the same values of the uniform\nresistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22125 and the power of injected turbulence\nP = 0.1. In the case of Sweet-Parker reconnection (squares) the\nvariance is negligible and not shown.\n\n3.2.3. Dependence on the Resistivity\n\nThe most important goal in our study is to check the dependence\nof the reconnection rate on the uniform resistivity. We run several simulations with different values of uniform resistivity \u03b7u\nand power of turbulence Pin j (see model RD in Table 1).\nIn Figure 11 we plot the obtained dependence of reconnection rate on uniform resistivity. For Sweet-Parker configuration\nthe averaged reconnection rate VrS P is represented by squares.\nDispersion of calculated points is almost negligible and not\nshown. As we can see the reconnection speed VrS P increases with\nuniform resistivity. From the fitting we obtain that the reconnection rate VrS P scales with the uniform resistivity as \u223c \u03b71/2\nu . This\nis in agreement with theoretical prediction (Sweet 1958; Parker\n1957) and confirms that our 2D model works well in the laminar\nreconnection stage.\nAdding turbulence to the system leads to a weaker dependence between the reconnection rate and the uniform resistivity.\nMoreover, the power of turbulence also influences this relationship, as is clearly visible in Figure 11 (triangles - Pin j = 0.01\n, squares - Pin j = 0.1). We fit lines to calculated points and\nfind that the dependence between reconnection rate and uniform resistivity is stronger for lower values of Pin j . Namely, for\nPin j = 0.1 and Pin j = 0.01 we get that the reconnection rate\n1/3\nscales as \u223c \u03b71/5\nu and \u223c \u03b7u , respectively.\nFor low values of the uniform resistivity (\u03b7u \u2264 1 * 10\u22123 Pin j = 0.1 and \u03b7u \u2264 7 * 10\u22124 -Pin j = 0.01) we see that the obtained\nreconnection speeds VrT B are almost the same. This similar values of reconnection rate may be caused by prevailing numerical\ndiffusion. Then, taking into account higher values of \u03b7u does not\nmodify the overall value of the total resistivity. However, in this\ncase the numerical diffusion will also influence the reconnection\nrate in the Sweet-Parker configuration, what does not happen in\nour simulations (see Figure 11).\nResults described above indicate that in 2D turbulent reconnection depends on the uniform resistivity.

As we see, the presence of anomalous resistivity causes an increase in the reconnection speed compared\nto a model with \u03b7a = 0 - dotted line (VrT B = 0.039). However,\nfor different values of the anomalous resistivity the reconnection\nspeed is almost the same. More precisely, we observe a nearly\nnegligible increase in the reconnection rate and a clear increase\nin the variance at larger values of the anomalous resistivity \u03b7a .\n3.3. Dependence on the Viscosity\n\nFig. 12. Dependence of the reconnection rate on the anomalous\nresistivity \u03b7a for models with and without turbulence, VrT B (diamonds) and VrS P (squares), respectively. Turbulence is injected at\nthe wavenumber k f = 12 with Pin j = 0.1. The uniform resistivity\n\u03b7u is equal 5*10\u22124 . The dotted line represents the mean reconnection rate obtained for the Sweet-Parker stage, dash-dotted marks\nthe value of the reconnection rate without anomalous resistivity\nand dashed line corresponds to the mean reconnection rate calculated for four models with different values of the anomalous\nresistivity.\n\nNext we test the influence of viscosity on the reconnection rate\nfor fixed values of the injection scale, turbulence strength and\nuniform resistivity (see model VD in Table 1). The results are\nshown in Figure 13 where we plot averaged reconnection rates\nfor the laminar (squares) and turbulent (diamonds) cases. In the\nSweet-Parker configuration the reconnection rate VrS P is almost\nthe same for viscosity \u03bd \u2264 1 * 10\u22123 and starts to decrease for \u03bd \u2265\n2*10\u22123 . In the present of turbulence the fit to the calculated points\nshows that the reconnection rate VrT B scales with the viscosity as\n\u223c \u03bd\u22121/3 . Furthermore, when the viscosity is larger than 1 * 10\u22123\nthe rate of reconnection for models with and without turbulence\nare similar.\n3.4. The Case of a Uniform Initial Configuration\n\ntained dependencies are not certain because of the large dispersion of results for small values of the uniform resistivity \u03b7u .\nWe also test the dependence of the reconnection rate on\nthe anomalous resistivity. We run several models with the same\nvalue of uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 and critical current\ndensity jcrit = 50 but for different values of the anomalous re-\n\nIn order to check the influence of our boundary conditions and\nmethod of driving turbulence on the reconnection process we\ncompare two models with different initial magnetic field configurations: antiparallel and uniform. The antiparallel initial configuration of the magnetic field is the same as in the case of the\nSweet-Parker reconnection, the uniform one is horizontal with\n\n\fK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\nFig. 14. Comparison of the reconnection rates obtained for models with uniform and antiparallel initial magnetic field configurations. All parameters describing models are the same: the power\nof turbulence Pin j = 0.1, the injection wavenumber k f = 12, and\nthe uniform resistivity coefficient \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 . The topology of\nthe velocity and magnetic velocity fields, as well as the distribution of the current density for both models are shown in Figure 6\n(antiparallel initial magnetic field) and in Figure 15 (uniform initial magnetic field).\nBx = 1. The rest of parameters characterizing both models are:\n\u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 , k f = 12, P = 0.1 and inflow/outflow boundary\nconditions. In both models we inject turbulence in the same way\nfrom t = 9 to t = 10.\nIn Figure 14 we show the comparison of reconnection rates\nobtained for the uniform and antiparallel initial magnetic field\nconfiguration. In the first case the reconnection rate is almost\nequal zero. We can see some small fluctuations, however we\ncannot observe any significant growth of the reconnection rate.\nIn the second case the value of reconnection rate is higher and\nchanges violently. For more precisely description of this case see\nSect. 3.2.\nThe almost negligible value of the reconnection rate for the\nmodel with a uniform initial magnetic field indicates that, as expected, magnetic reconnection does not occur. This also supports\nthe conclusion that our calculation of the reconnection rate is not\nan artifact of our boundary conditions or our method for implementing turbulence.\nFigure 15 shows the topology of magnetic and velocity field\nas well as the distribution of current density for model with initial uniform configuration of the magnetic field. As before turbulence is injected in a volume surrounding the midplane which\ncauses perturbations of the velocity field in this region (see the\nleft panel in Figure 15). Most of fluctuations propagate along the\nmean magnetic field running more or less parallel to the midplane (see the middle panel in Figure 15). The well defined bend\nof magnetic lines presented in the case of turbulent reconnection are not visible here. This is because we do not have a diffusion region, where the magnetic lines change their direction and\nstrength, and can be bent by fluctuations. On the other hand, turbulence causes small perturbations of magnetic field which leads\nto an enhancement of the absolute value of the current density\n(see the middle panel in Figure 15).\n3.5. Long Term Variance of the Reconnection Rate\n\nThe time evolution of the reconnection rate for the same model\nas in Figure 5 but calculated over a longer period of time (tend =\n\n11\n\nFig. 17. Time evolution of the total mass M (solid line), magnetic\nEmag (dashed line) and kinetic Ekin (dotted line) energies during\nSweet-Parker (from t = 0 to t = 9) and turbulent (from t = 9 to\nt = 50 reconnection with uniform resistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 . The\nkinetic energy Ekin is not amplified in this plot.\n50) is shown in Figure 16. We see that even after 50 Alf\u00e9nic\ntimes the reconnection rate does not reach a steady state. Strong\nand continuous fluctuations are seen over the whole simulation\ntime. All these quasiperiodic changes of the reconnection rate\nare apparently driven by something like the tearing mode instability. Namely, big loops of magnetic field are continuously\ncreated (see Figure 18) and ejected through boundaries.\nIn Figure 17 we show the evolution of mass, magnetic and\nkinetic energy during the Sweet-Parker (from t = 0 to t = 9)\nand turbulent (from t = 9 to t = 50) reconnection. We see that\nadding turbulence to the system or using open boundary conditions does not introduce instabilities in the total mass or kinetic\nand magnetic energies.\nWhat is more, increasing tend from 20 to 50 only slightly\ninfluences the average reconnection rate and its variance. For\nmodels with tend = 20 and tend = 50 we get VrT B = 0.039 \u00b1 0.019\nand VrT B = 0.041 \u00b1 0.017, respectively.\nThis indicates that extending the simulation time does not\nlead to a stable state of reconnection and does not change our\nresults.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. The Goals of this Study\n\nThe present paper provides a follow-up study to Kowal et al.\n(2009). In that paper fast magnetic reconnection of a 3D weakly\nstochastic magnetic field, predicted in the LV99 theoretical\nstudy, was confirmed. Can turbulent reconnection be fast in 2D\nas well? The question may sound rather scholastic, as the nature\nwe deal with is definitely three dimensional. However, there are\nat least two reasons why answering this question is important.\nFirst of all, the claim in LV99 is that 3D effects are essential for\nfast reconnection. Thus it is important to test this claim and to\nexplore whether fast reconnection in the presence of turbulence\ncan be carried over to 2D. Then, in a number of earlier studies it\nwas conjectured that magnetic reconnection could become fast\nin the presence of turbulence for purely 2D reconnection configurations.\nIn all respects apart from dimensionality the present numerical set-up is identical to that in Kowal et al. (2009). In particular,\n\n\f12\n\nK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\nFig. 15. Topology of velocity (left panel) and magnetic field (middle panel), and the absolute value of the current density distribution\n(right panel) in the case of the initially uniform magnetic field at the time t = 14. Brighter shades correspond to larger values of the\ndisplayed quantities. Turbulence is injected with the power Pin j = 0.1 at wavenumber k f = 12. The uniform resistivity \u03b7u is equal\n5 * 10\u22124 . For comparison, the model with the same set of parameters but with an initially antiparallel configuration of magnetic field\nis presented in Figure 6.\n\nFig. 16. Time evolution of the reconnection speed for the model with t Pin j = 0.1, an injection wavenumber k f = 12 and a uniform\nresistivity \u03b7u = 5 * 10\u22124 .\nthe excitation of turbulence in both case at subAlfv\u00e9nic velocities, thereby preventing field reversals arising from turbulence.\nFor measurements of the reconnection rate we adopt the procedure presented in Kowal et al. (2009). This enables us to make\neasy comparison between the 3D and 2D reconnection results.\n\n4.2. 2D versus 3D Reconnection\n\nUntil very recently 2D geometry has been favored for magnetic\nreconnection studies. Its advantage stems from the fact that it allows one to achieve much higher Lundquist numbers compared\nto its 3D counterpart. The most important question is whether\nthe nature of reconnection is the same in 3D and in 2D. It is\nsuggestive that the answer to this question is positive if the reconnection of laminar magnetic field is involved. Our results on\n\nthe Sweet-Parker reconnection above are very similar2 to the results of the Sweet-Parker reconnection in Kowal et al. (2009). At\nthe same time our comparison of the results in the present paper\nwith those in Kowal et al. (2009) shows that the reconnection in\nthe presence of turbulence is very different.\nThe aforementioned difference is not surprising if one takes\ninto account that the nature of the 2D and 3D MHD turbulence is\nrather different. In particular, magnetic field wandering, which is\nan essential part of the LV99 reconnection model, has a radically\ndifferent nature in 3D and 2D. What we have in 2D is coherent\ndisplacement of magnetic field lines by Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations,\nwhile in 3D magnetic field lines can slip past one another, enjoying the freedom provided by the additional dimension. As a result, in LV99 different bundles of wandering magnetic field lines\n2\nThe obtained dependence of reconnection pace on the uniform\nresistivity coincide in 2D and 3D and is consistent with theory, i.e.\nVrS P \u223c \u03b71/2\nu .\n\n\fK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\nFig. 18. Topology of magnetic field in the presence of turbulence at time t = 49. The uniform resistivity \u03b7u is equal 5 * 10\u22124 .\nTurbulence is injected with the power Pin j = 0.1 at scale k = 12.\nBrighter shades correspond to larger values of the displayed\nquantities.\n\ncan enter the reconnection zone independently, and reconnect simultaneously. It was shown in LV99 that it is this simultaneous\nreconnection of independent magnetic flux bundles that makes\nreconnection insensitive to resistivity. This effect is absent in 2D\nwhere the entry of fresh flux into the reconnection zone is constrained by the rate of removal of reconnected flux.\nThe second effect that enables fast reconnection in the LV99\nmodel is an increase of the thickness of the outflow region.\nThere we see some similarity between 2D and 3D reconnection.\nIndeed, while the outflow in the Sweet-Parker reconnection is\nconstrained by the thin slot determined by Ohmic diffusivity, it\nis due to an increase of the thickness of the outflow through turbulence that 2D turbulent reconnection is faster than the SweetParker rate. The outflow region in both 2D and 3D case depends\non the intensity of driving and the scale of turbulence injection.\nHowever, the functional dependencies are different and this difference stems from the difference in the reconnection physics.\nAs we mentioned earlier, magnetic field wandering plays\na decisive role in 3D reconnection. In 2D reconnection is not\nfast, since we observe the creation of magnetic islands as a result of turbulence. This process is rather limited unless the turbulent injection velocity approaches VA . We believe that this\nexplains why the dependence of the reconnection rate on the\nOhmic resistivity becomes steeper as the turbulence weakens\n(see Figure 11). Indeed, for weaker turbulence the alternate compression and expansion of the current sheet, which leads to magnetic island formation is weaker and reconnection is similar to\nthe Sweet-Parker model. Similarly, the combination of anomalous resistivity and magnetic island formation 3 reaches a saturated level of efficiency for modest values of the anomalous re3\n\nWhile the 3D reconnection of weakly stochastic magnetic field depends on the Alfv\u00e9nic, i.e. the incompressible, component of magnetic\nturbulence, the creation of magnetic islands depends on the compressible component of the turbulence (see Cho & Lazarian 2003, for the\ndecomposition of MHD turbulent motions).\n\n13\n\nsistivity, and appears to become insensitive to further increases\n(see Figure 12).\nIt is important to note that magnetic field structures, i.e. magnetic islands, that we observe in 2D simulations do not appear in\n3D simulation (Kowal et al. 2009). What is more, Kowal et al.\n(2009) obtained a stable value of the reconnection speed in the\npresence of turbulence in a short period, about one Alv\u00e9n time.\nIn our work we are unable to reach this state because the reconnection rate continuously and violently fluctuates. Consequently\nthe average speed of turbulent magnetic reconnection in 2D is\nburdened with much higher statistical errors than in 3D.\nIn our work we determine the dependence of the reconnection rate on four quantities: the power of turbulence Pin j , the injection wavenumber k f , the uniform \u03b7u and the anomalous \u03b7a resistivities. The same analysis was done by Kowal et al. (2009) in\nthree dimensions. For the power of turbulence and injection scale\n3/4\nTB\nthey found the following scalings: VrT B \u223c P1/2\n\u223c lin\nin j and Vr\nj.\nCompared to our findings the dependencies obtained in 3D are\nstronger. Namely, in the 2D case the reconnection rate grows\nwith the power of turbulence as VrT B \u223c P1/3\nin j and with the injec2/3\ntion scale as VrT B \u223c lin\nj.\n\n4.3. Earlier Studies of 2D Turbulent Reconnection and Their\nRelation to Work\n\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, the concept of turbulent\nenhancement of reconnection is not unprecedented. In Kowal\net al. (2009) we presented a list of papers where turbulent effects were cited as the source of fast astrophysical reconnection. Compared to the present paper, all these papers lacked a\nprecise means of measuring the reconnection speed and therefore the numerical simulations were providing mostly qualitative\nresults. Moreover, they adopted periodic boundary conditions,\nwhich made it difficult to study turbulent reconnection for more\nthan a single Alfv\u00e9n time.\nAmong these papers, the pioneering work were the numerical studies in Matthaeus & Lamkin (1985, 1986). There the analysis of 2D simulations of turbulence revealed the formation of\nmagnetic islands and X-points reminiscent of the Petscheck process.\nIn our 2D model of turbulent reconnection we also observe\ncontinuous formation of magnetic islands which are ejected from\nthe reconnection zone due to open boundary conditions. For instance, we observe that when big loop of magnetic field is removed from the box through boundaries, the reconnection rate\nincreases sharply. After that the reconnection rate drops until\nnew magnetic island can be created.\nThe formation of islands is also a consequence of the tearing instability. In this vein, Loureiro et al. (2004) examined the\nnonlinear growth of tearing modes and obtained a fast growth of\nmagnetic islands. However, in their simulations they used periodic boundary conditions, which keep such islands in the reconnection zone.\nThe most directly relevant work is Fan et al. (2004, 2005).\nThey found that the turbulent magnetic reconnection in solar atmosphere could be described by a two phase process: first-slow\nand second-fast. The rapid stage of reconnection is caused by the\ncoalescence instability Biskamp & Welter (1980); Wu & Chang\n(2001) which may also enhance the reconnection rate in our simulations.\nHere, and in contrast to the 3D model of LV99, we find that\nin 2D the influence of the uniform resistivity on the reconnection rate is stronger for higher values of \u03b7u and lower values\n\n\f14\n\nK. Kulpa-Dybel et al.: Reconnection in weakly stochastic B-fields in 2D\n\nof Pin j . Similar results have also been obtained by (Loureiro et\nal. 2009). They claimed that the reconnection process is fast in\n2D only in some particular circumstances i.e. for higher values\nof the Lundquist number and moderate levels of turbulence. We\ndisagree with the claim of fast turbulent reconnection in 2D. In\nfact, in the most of models analyzed by (Loureiro et al. 2009) the\nreconnection process depends on the uniform resistivity. Again\nan important limitation of the aforementioned study is their limited averaging arising from their choice of boundary conditions.\n4.4. Implications\n\nTwo dimensional magnetic reconnection is the result of a rather\nartificial configuration. The value of our present study is that\nit clarifies the role of the effects of dimensionality for the actual\n3D reconnection of astrophysical magnetic fields in the presence\nof weak turbulence. The latter has many essential implications\nstarting from the First Order Fermi acceleration of energetic particles (de Gouveia dal Pino & Lazarian 2005; Lazarian & Opher\n2009) to Solar Flares (see Lazarian et al. 2009) and removal of\nmagnetic field during star formation (Lima et al. 2009). These\nimplications are discussed in more detail in Kowal et al. (2009).\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have examined the results of 2D simulations of\nreconnection process in presence of subAlfvenic turbulence. Our\nfindings may be summarized as follows:\n\u2013 Unlike Sweet-Parker reconnection, the reconnection of a\nweakly stochastic magnetic field is fundamentally different\nin 2D and 3D, in agreement the LV99 study. Reconnection\nin 2D depends on resistivity and is not fast.\n\u2013 The enhancement of magnetic reconnection in 2D arises\nfrom an increase in the thickness of the plasma outflow layer\ndue to the creation of magnetic islands which are ejected\nfrom the reconnection layer.\n\u2013 The power of turbulence Pin j and the injection scale k f have\nan influence on the reconnection rate. In our study this is:\n1/3\n2/3\nVrT B \u223c Pin\nj \u223c lin j .\nAcknowledgements.
