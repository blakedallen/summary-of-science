The papers in this volume represent a broad spectrum of\nobservational, theoretical, and computational astrophysics, sharing as\na unifying core the Disk-Halo Interaction in the Milky Way and other\nspiral galaxies. This topic covers a wide range of Galactic and extragalactic research, built on a foundation of numerous and diverse physical processes. This summary groups the papers according to six themes,\nwith some historical background and finally a look to the future. The final message is that the astrophysical techniques discussed and reviewed\nat this conference will grow over the next decade to answer even more\nfundamental questions about galaxy evolution and the history of the\nuniverse.\n\n1\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThis conference on the Disk-Halo Interaction in Galaxy Evolution has been a\nshowcase for many exciting new results in a broad spectrum of Galactic and extragalactic research. Later in this summary I will briefly consider the significance\nof some of these results, and how they show the way forward. But first a few\nparagraphs of historical background, for the benefit of people who are new to the\nfield. These concepts were implicit in many of the papers at the conference, but\nwere not often mentioned explicitly.\nFor astrophysicists, the Disk-Halo connection is almost as old as the interstellar medium itself. By the early 1950's it was clear that both cosmic rays and\ninterstellar clouds must sometimes leave the disk. A series of papers culminating\nin Spitzer's seminal 1956 analysis (Spitzer 1956, Shklovsky 1952, Pickelner 1953),\nbased on the gravitational potential of the disk determined much earlier by Oort\n(1932), predicted a hot gas halo above and below the disk. The need for cosmic\nray (CR) leakage into this halo implied that magnetic fields must connect it with\nthe disk. In the decade that followed, detailed astrophysical calculations of the\n1\n\nUniversity of Tasmania, Maths and Physics - Bag 37, Hobart, TAS 7005, Australia\nc EDP Sciences 2018\nDOI: (will be inserted later)\n\n\f2\n\nThe Role of Disk-Halo Interaction in Galaxy Evolution: Outflow vs Infall?\n\nheating and cooling rates of the neutral and ionized gas in the interstellar medium\n(ISM) showed that thermal equilibrium between different phases at very different\ntemperatures could be achieved at a range of pressures that depends on the heavy\nelement abundance and the radiation field intensity (Field et al. 1969, Dalgarno\n& McCray 1972). Meanwhile, by the early 1960's the high velocity clouds seen in\n21-cm line surveys were interpreted as evidence for both a population of neutral\nclouds in the halo, and a surrounding hot gas through which they were falling\ntoward the disk (Oort 1966, 1970).\nDramatic observational confirmation of the existence of hot ISM gas in the\nMilky Way disk came in the early 1970's from soft x-ray emission (Williamson et\nal. 1974, Sanders et al. 1977) and uv absorption (Jenkins & Meloy 1974, York\n1974). This hot gas was immediately identified with that predicted by Spitzer\nfor the halo, and the cycling of gas between the disk and halo was proposed soon\nafter by Shapiro & Field (1976, c.f. Bregman 1980). It was soon clear that the\nhot phase gas occupies much of the disk and connects with the halo, in part from\ninterpretation of the anticorrelation between nearby atomic and molecular clouds\nand the soft x-ray emission (McCammon et al. 1976, Mebold et al. 1985).\nThe theoretical framework for understanding the hot phase of the ISM developed in the early 1970's as well, as the role of old supernova remnants (SNR) in\npressurizing the disk was explored quantitatively (Cox & Smith 1974, Salpeter\n1976, McKee & Ostriker 1977). By the mid-1980's it was clear that the McKeeOstriker paradigm was insufficient to describe the real ISM. The Milky Way (MW)\nand many other spiral galaxies have star formation rates high enough to drive hot\ngas out of the disk, and with it energy in thermal and mechanical forms (Cox &\nMcCammon 1986, Cowie 1987, Norman & Ikeuchi 1989, Heiles 1990), which is\nnot included in the Mckee-Ostriker model. Meanwhile the power of computational\nastrophysics was brought to the problem of SNR evolution (Chevalier & Gardner 1974, Mansfield & Salpeter 1974, Struck-Marcell & Scalo 1984, MacLow et\nal. 1989, Cioffi & Shull 1991), culminating in two- and finally three-dimensional\nsimulations of the global ISM (Rosen & Bregman 1995, Vazquez-Semadeni et al.\n1995, Avillez 2000).\nOne of the threads running through all of these works, observational and theoretical, is that we cannot fully understand the ISM of the MW disk without\nunderstanding also that of the halo and how the two media interact and exchange\nmatter. In the last two decades our observational data on the ISM in the MW\nhalo has improved dramatically. Even more dramatic progress has been made in\nstudies of the ISM of other galaxies. We can see clearly now that galactic fountains operate in some spiral galaxies, and not in others. We see examples of disks\nwith infall and outflow. It is even becoming possible to trace these processes as\nfunctions of redshift. One of the goals of this conference is to bring our detailed\nknowledge of the disk-halo interaction in the MW to bear on the much larger\nquestion of galaxy evolution over cosmic time.\n\n\fSummary: Themes and Questions\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThemes of This Conference\n\nThis conference has been ambitious in its combination of topics, including observational, theoretical, and computational studies of the MW disk and halo, the disks\nand halos of nearby galaxies, and gas infall and outflow in galaxies at intermediate\nand high redshifts. The papers reviewing these topics allow us to look back and\nalso ahead, to see what will become possible in the next decade or so as powerful new telescopes become available. Rather than try to summarize the papers\nindividually, I will consider a few themes, and group the papers accordingly. Of\ncourse any such grouping is arbitrary and does not do justice to the depth and\ncomplexity of the papers or their subjects, but there is not room for much more\ndetail. Citations given as names without dates refer to papers presented at this\nmeeting and their written versions that appear in this volume.\n\n3\n\nTheme \u2013 Magnetic Fields and Cosmic Rays Link the Disk and Halo\n\nIt has been understood for a long time that the ISM is subject to a magnetic\nRayleigh-Taylor instability wherein the light fluids constituted by the magnetic\nfield and the relativistic CR electrons can move through the heavier fluid constituted by the thermal phases of the gas to escape the gravitational potential of the\nMW disk (Parker 1966). But how much impact this has on the dynamics of the\ngas in the disk and halo is still not known. One approach is to map the interstellar\nmagnetic field to see where and how the field joins the disk with the halo. It is\npossible in various ways to map the field in the disk, as explained in the papers by\nBeck and Vall\u00e9e. Searching for a vertical component of the field in the solar neighborhood is particularly interesting, as reported by Mao, based on Faraday rotation\nsurveys at high latitudes. Troland's paper explains how Zeeman splitting obserkinetic\n. This quantity is about 0.3 for the\nvations at 21-cm give values for \u03b2 \u2261 PPmagnetic\nthermal pressure (with kinetic velocities given by the temperature) but \u03b2 \u2243 1.2\nwhen non-thermal bulk velocities are included. This reflects the typical Mach\nnumber of about 4 for turbulent velocities in cool, neutral medium (CNM) clouds.\nThus the magnetic field is dynamically important in this phase, and probably in\nall other phases of the ISM, but it is not completely dominant. It is significant,\nhowever, that magnetic pressure is much higher than thermal gas pressure, as this\ncould moderate the rate of cooling. Ferri\u00e8re's paper supports Troland's in these\nconclusions, and gives an overview on a larger scale of the magnetic field structure\nof the disk.\nThe dynamical importance of the magnetic field has recently been included in\nsimulations of the structure and dynamics of the ISM, as reported at this conference by Breitschwerdt, Asgekar, Hanasz, and Woltanski. Including the CR\npressure, which Breitschwerdt couples to the gas through a spectrum of magnetoacoustic waves, drives the gas quite effectively out of the disk, in good agreement\nwith the analytical prediction of Everett. The extensive review by Dogiel presents\nseveral fundamental equations and observations that describe CR propagation\nthrough the disk and halo. Some well established results from this are the scale\n\n\f4\n\nThe Role of Disk-Halo Interaction in Galaxy Evolution: Outflow vs Infall?\n\nheight of the CR population (3 kpc), the propagation path length (3 Mpc), and\nhence the travel time (107 yr). Clearly there is a lot of energy available in the form\nof magnetic fields and CR's; the CR acceleration processes alone have luminosity\nof more than 1042 erg s\u22121 . Further, per unit energy density, the CR's are more efficient at driving mass out of the disk and into the halo than is simple gas pressure,\nas Everett explains. On the much larger scales of clusters of galaxies, the paper by\nBernet reviews the evidence for magnetic fields to at least redshift z=1.3 as traced\nby Faraday rotation. Thus we can infer that magnetic fields and cosmic rays have\nbeen escaping from galaxies, at least some galaxies in some environments, for a\nvery long time.\n\n4\n\nTheme \u2013 The Mixture of ISM Phases in the Milky Way\n\nThe different thermal phases of the ISM are typically studied with different spectral\nlines or other tracers, so understanding the juxtaposition and relative abundances\nof the different phases is like putting together separate pieces of a puzzle. Ferri\u00e8re's,\nJenkins', and V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni's papers review concepts of pressure equilibrium,\nthermal equilibrium, transition of gas from one phase to another, and how the\nmixture of phases depends on height above the plane, z. The scale heights of the\nwarm and cool phases are discussed further by Gaensler, Reynolds, and Kalberla.\nThe ISM phases in M31 are discussed in the papers of Berkhuijsen, Bogdan, and\nBraun. The phase-mixture of the MW ISM is one of the central topics of the\nconference, and the papers in this volume represent the considered opinions of\npeople who have been leaders of this field for decades. Yet the numbers presented\nhere, particularly the scale heights and their variation with Galactic radius, differ\nin some cases by 30% to 50% from estimates made a few years ago. Clearly the\ndiffuse ISM of the MW needs further research! But the papers presented at this\nmeeting reinforce the general consensus that we do understand the ISM in the\nMW disk fairly well, and we can confidently extend our observing techniques and\nanalysis tools to the halo, to nearby galaxies, and on to high redshifts.\n\n5\n\nTheme \u2013 Structures in the MW Halo\n\nThe scale heights of the phases do not completely describe the structure of the\nISM in the MW halo. As Lockman puts it in his presentation, in the halo we\nsee \"hydrogen that has a story to tell about how it got there.\" One of the most\ndramatic examples is Smith's Cloud (Smith 1963, Lockman et al. 2008), a high\nvelocity cloud (HVC) with mass greater than 106 M\u2299 and total space velocity of\nabout 300 km s\u22121 , approaching the Galactic plane at some 75 km s\u22121 . This is\nlarge compared to typical HVC's described in Wakker's review, but by no means\nthe largest, as Complex C is estimated to have mass 4 x 107 M\u2299 . Typical distances\nabove or below the plane, |z|, are in the range 5 to 15 kpc for these large HVC\ncomplexes. Assuming that they represent primordial material, their mass accretion\nrate averages to about 0.5 to 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . As Putman points out in her paper,\n\n\fSummary: Themes and Questions\n\n5\n\nmaintaining an accretion rate of 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 over the last 5 to 7 Gyr would require\na primordial reservoir of as many as 500 dwarf galaxies with HI mass 107 M\u2299 , or\n5000 HVC complexes of 106 M\u2299 . This is a lot, there certainly do not seem to be\nnearly that many such systems in the Local Group remaining to be accreted. So\nit is important to work out the stories that the HVC complexes have to tell, by\ndetailed studies such as those described by Ford, Dedes, Madsen, Haffner, Leiter,\nand Hill. The larger objective of such work is to determine what their precursors\nwere. Some of today's HVC complexes may have come from dwarf galaxies that\nwere tidally disrupted and captured by the MW, or they may have come from\ntidal stripping of an existing Local Group member, like the Magellanic Stream\ndiscussed in the papers by Madsen, Wakker, and Putman, or perhaps they have\nsomehow been part of the MW halo since the epoch of galaxy formation.\nThere seems to be a clear distinction between the large, 21-cm selected HVC\ncomplexes and the much lower mass clouds that dominate optical and uv surveys\ntoward distant halo stars, described by Wakker, Ben-Bekhti, Nasoudi-Shoar, and\nFox, and earlier by Smoker et al. (2003), Lockman & Savage (1995), and see the\nhistorical data discussed by Benjamin & Danly (1997). The clouds seen in these\nsurveys are similar to clouds seen in extragalactic absorption studies; at least some\nof them are classical fountain-return clouds. Some of the HI HVC's are probably\nin this category as well. For launching the fountain, the large Galactic chimneys\nand supershells are leading contenders, as described by McClure-Griffiths, Sato,\nPidopryhora, Gon\u00e7alves, and Dawson. These concentrate and direct the energy\nprovided by many supernova remnants to drive hot gas out of the plane and into the\nlower halo. Such structures appear to be common in nearby spiral galaxies. The\nstructure of the M82 superwind is reminiscent of a galactic chimney driven to the\nextreme by the starburst nucleus, as discussed by Westmoquette and Trinchieri.\n\n6\n\nTheme \u2013 HVC's in Nearby Galaxies and Groups\n\nOne of the most successful aspects of this conference has been the seamless merging\nof Galactic and extra-galactic observations and theory. This shows the maturity of\nthe field, in that the same astrophysical phenomena that we study in detail in the\nMW we can trace more broadly in nearby spirals, and with fair sensitivity even\nat intermediate to high redshift. Thus many of the themes in Dettmar's review\nof disk-halo interaction in nearby galaxies echo those of Ferri\u00e8re's review of the\nsame topic in the MW, and many other reviews include both Galactic and extragalactic examples. In particular, the HI HVC's in the Local Group and nearby\ngalaxy groups reviewed by Putman, Oosterloo, and Chynoweth, are analogous to\nthe large HVC complexes in the MW halo. But their morphology can be completely\ndifferent. Unlike the Local Group, the M81-M82-NGC3077 group has a neutral\nintra-group medium, probably a massive tidal feature, as described by Chynowyth.\nThe Local Group is more typical, apparently cases like the M82 group are rare.\nBut it is critically important to get more sensitive HI surveys of many more nearby\ngroups, in order to interpret the data from absorption surveys at intermediate and\nhigh redshifts. This will come from new arrays with enhanced surface brightness\n\n\f6\n\nThe Role of Disk-Halo Interaction in Galaxy Evolution: Outflow vs Infall?\n\nsensitivity, like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP).\n\n7\n\nTheme \u2013 The Halos of Spiral Galaxies seen Edge-On\n\nSpiral galaxies seen very nearly edge-on are excellent subjects for study of the z\ndistribution of the ISM phases, and the structure of the gas in ther halos. Such\nstudies are the topics of the papers by Rossa, Wu, Rand, Heald, Howk, and Oosterloo's poster, and they are included in the reviews by Dettmar and Reynolds.\nFrom these studies we learn what a range of fountain activity there is in spiral\ngalaxies, depending on the star formation rate (SFR). The lower halos of the edgeon spirals that have been studied in detail show how different the scale heights of\nthe diffuse neutral and warm ionized media can be, ranging from a few hundred\npc to a few kpc. Rossa also makes the point that the morphology of the diffuse\nionized gas changes with SFR, with the high SFR galaxies showing a smooth ionized halo, and the intermediate (lower) SFR galaxies showing many wisps that\nprobably trace large chimneys, bubbles, and supershells.\nAnother critical question that edge-on spirals can help answer is how the rotation velocity of the gas in the halo departs from that of the disk below. Heald and\nBenjamin discuss this based on observations, and Fraternali reviews theoretical\nand computational studies. Here again, the SFR seems to play a critical role. Values for the gradient in rotation velocity with z vary from -8 to -30 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ,\nwith the higher values seen in the galaxies with lower SFR's. This may imply that\nhigh fountain activity strengthens the dynamical connection between the disk and\nlower halo, essentially acting as a viscosity that depends on SFR. Similar numbers\nfor the Milky Way are still a bit controversial; Levine et al. (2008) find -22\u00b16 km\ns\u22121 kpc\u22121 , see also the review by Kalberla & Kerp (2008).\nA series of major surveys of nearby galaxies including SINGS (Kennicutt et\nal. 2003), THINGS (Walter et al. 2008), and SONG (Regan et al. 2001) are\nmentioned in a few papers in this conference, including those of Leiter and Portas.\nThese surveys are primarily concerned with the disks of nearby spiral galaxies.\nThey are rich in information on the mixture of ISM phases, and the links from the\nISM to star formation. They will also prove useful for understanding the disk-halo\nconnection. These surveys are particularly interesting for revealing the structure\nof the outer disks, beyond the area of active star formation. Conditions in such\nouter disks are in some ways intermediate between those in the inner disk and in\nthe halo, as discussed by Kalberla and Dickey for the MW. These surveys give a\nhint of the even more powerful studies of nearby galaxies that will be possible in\nthe coming decade with telescopes such as ALMA, JWST, and the SKA.\n\n8\n\nTheme \u2013 Outflows from Galaxies at High Redshift\n\nSurveys of absorption lines in the spectra of QSO's at high redshift are a very\npowerful way to trace the abundance of gas clouds intervening along the path to the\ncontinuum source. Studies of the Lyman alpha forest can detect clouds with atomic\n\n\fSummary: Themes and Questions\n\n7\n\nhydrogen column densities as low as 1013 cm\u22122 . Ranges of progressively increasing\ncolumn densities are sampled by metal line systems, Lyman limit systems, and\ndamped Lyman alpha systems finally reaching column densities of 1022 cm\u22122 or\nhigher. A remarkable result from forty years of such studies is that the abundance\nof absorbing systems as a function of column density, n(NH ), can be described\n\u22121.58\ndn\n\u221d NH\n,\nas a power law over this entire range of column densities, with dN\nH\nas reviewed by Richter. Many of these absorption lines originate in the halos or\nouter disks of intervening galaxies; we infer that some of these clouds are driven by\ngalactic fountain processes similar to those we see in the MW and nearby galaxies.\nThe ISM in high redshift galaxies can also be studied using emission line tracers,\nparticularly at mm and sub-mm wavelengths, as reviewed by Greve. As ALMA\ncomes on-line in the next few years, this field will grow rapidly, and we may hope\nto detect galaxies like the MW at redshift z\u223c1. For now, most of the galaxies\nstudied at such great distances are at the high end of the CO and far-IR luminosity\nfunctions, typically starburst and ultra-luminous IR galaxies plus some QSO's.\nWith the power of 8m class optical telescopes, absorption lines can be studied\nnot only toward bright QSO's, but also using the light of normal galaxies at high\nredshift. The DEEP survey described by Koo, and the specific examples presented\nby Rubin, show the amazing accomplishments of high z spectroscopy at the Keck\nTelescope. Both outflow and infall are seen in galaxies in the DEEP sample, with\noutflow correlating with infrared luminosity, but infall not. Results of stacked\nspectra give very useful numbers, such as that 10% of absorption lies beyond the\nescape velocities of the galaxies, and the fact that almost all galaxies have at least\nsome outflow gas. A further result is that it is not the dwarfs but the more massive\ngalaxies, like the MW, that dominate the total outflow that ultimately enriches\nthe inter-galactic medium with heavy elements.\nTo calibrate the present abundance of absorbing clouds vs. the numbers in the\nearly universe requires low redshift surveys of the far-uv lines, seen shifted into\nthe optical and near-IR at high redshift, using far-uv telescopes like FUSE. The\npapers by Fox and Richter give useful comparisons among different line tracers in\nthe optical and uv. An interesting twist is the appearance of two populations of\nMg II absorbers. The stronger class of lines is more reliably a tracer of outflows.\nTheories and questions involving galaxy evolution and the history of disk-halo\ninteractions were presented by Bernet, Jachym, Fangano, Martin and Bregman.\nThere are some very big issues involved, such as the \"missing baryon problem\"\nraised by Bregman, and the metal enrichment of the IGM discussed in detail by\nMartin. Martin makes the point that \"What you see is not everything that is\nthere.\" It is very important to remember that outflows can and do happen at\ntemperature and density combinations for which we have no sensitive tracers. For\nexample, at temperature T \u223c 107 K (1 KeV x-rays) we can hardly make out the\nwinds even from nearby galaxies, let alone high redshift systems, as Trinchieri\nexplains.\n\n\f8\n\nThe Role of Disk-Halo Interaction in Galaxy Evolution: Outflow vs Infall?\n\n9\n\nWhat Next?\n\nTelescopes that will become available over the next decade will bring improvements\nin resolution and sensitivity of an order of magnitude or more in many wavebands.\nWith such improvements over current capabilities it will become possible to study\ngalaxies like the MW at z=1 with the same level of detail that we now apply to\ngalaxies in nearby groups. This conference has demonstrated that extragalactic\nand Galactic astrophysics merge when the observational data get that good.\nThe point is, the questions we are asking now about nearby galaxies are the same\nones we have been asking and answering in the MW for decades. Soon we may be\ndoing the same for galaxies at z=1 and beyond.\nExperts in this field, albeit self-appointed ones like many of us attending this\nconference, stand to gain academic ground in studies of galaxies at high redshift,\nas the science shifts into our purview. We can start thinking now about what we\nwould do if we had images and spectra of galaxies at cosmological distances as\ngood as those we have now for, e.g., M81 and M82. Here are some questions that\nwe might begin to answer:\n\u2022 Do disks assemble by satellite accretion? Why doesn't this disrupt the disk?\nDoes it lead to SF bursts? If there are SF bursts, do they denude the disk?\nDoes SF have a negative feedback \"governor\" that limits its speed in a disk\nwhere the ISM can easily be lost to a wind or fountain?\n\u2022 Is the intra-cluster medium (ICM) that we see in nearby rich clusters representative of the inter-galactic medium (IGM), in metallicity and in the\nratio of total baryon mass to galaxy light? If so, how and when did all the\nbaryons escape from the galaxies? Was this happening at the same time as\nthe accretion that built galaxies?\n\u2022 Did the magnetic field build up slowly through a dynamo process in galaxy\ndisks, or was it rapidly generated during the epoch of galaxy formation? How\nmuch seed field came from the big bang itself? Is there an IGM of magnetic\nfields and CR's similar to those seen in the ICM of rich clusters?\nIn the next decade we may be confronted with the data we need to answer these\nquestions. \"Confronted\" because we may not be ready to understand it all. For\nwant of more profound insight, the interpretation of that data will probably follow\nastrophysical analysis paths similar to those discussed in this volume as applied\nto the disk and halo of the MW and nearby galaxies. We can look forward to\nextending what we have learned about our own disk-halo connection to galaxies\non much larger scales. If this brings deeper understanding of the history of the\nuniverse, then we can hope for more conferences as interesting as this one in years\nto come.\n\nReferences\nAvillez, M.A., 2000, MNRAS 315, 479.\n\n\fSummary: Themes and Questions\n\n9\n\nBenjamin, R.A., & Danly, L., 1997, ApJ 481, 764.\nBregman, J.N., 1980, ApJ 236, 577.\nChavalier, R.A. & Gardner, J., 1974, ApJ 192, 457.\nCioffi, D.F., & Shull, J.M. 1991, ApJ 367, 96.\nCox, D.P. & Smith, B.W., 1974, ApJ 189, 105.\nCox, D.P. & McCammon, D., 1986, ApJ 304, 657.\nCowie, L.L., 1987, in Interstellar Processes, eds.
