In this article, we review recent results on transport\nof two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in moderately strong transverse magnetic fields B. Specifically,\nwe concentrate on a range of B which are classically strong (i.e., \u03c9c \u03c4tr \u226b 1, where \u03c9c is the cyclotron\nfrequency and \u03c4tr the transport relaxation time), but where quantum localization effects (and, correspondingly, quantum Hall physics) are not developed yet. There exists a broad class of phenomena that lead to\nstrong magnetoresistivity \u03c1xx (B) in this range of fields, in view of the developed cyclotron motion. These\nphenomena are discussed in the present review.\n\n2 Quasiclassical memory effects in magnetoresistance\nThe recent interest in quasiclassical transport properties of a 2DEG has been largely motivated by the\nexperimental and practical importance of high-mobility heterostructures, in which charged impurities are\nseparated from the 2DEG by a wide spacer. The correlation radius of disorder produced by the impurities is\nusually much larger than the Fermi wave length of electrons and transport in the 2DEG retains signatures\nof the underlying quasiclassical dynamics of the particles. On the theoretical side, much of the interest\nhas been inspired by a variety of anomalous transport phenomena which, while being essentially classical,\ncannot be described by Boltzmann-Drude kinetic theory. The quasiclassical \"non-Boltzmann\" phenomena\nin disordered electron systems are due to correlations of scattering acts at the points where quasiclassical\npaths self-intersect, which gives rise to memory effects, neglected in the conventional Boltzmann equation.\nIn particular, the non-Markovian kinetics yields a strong magnetoresistance (MR) and anomalies in the ac\nresponse. The strength of the quasiclassical anomalies depends on the ratio d/l, where d is the correlation\nradius of disorder, l the mean free path, and grows with increasing d as a power of this parameter. Since\nquantum corrections (weak localization, Altshuler-Aronov corrections, etc.) are governed by a different\nsmall parameter 1/kF l \u226a 1, where kF is the Fermi wave vector, it is the long-range correlations of disorder\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nAlso at A.F.

Dmitriev et al.: Magnetotransport in quantum-Hall systems\n\nwith kF d \u226b 1 that reveal the quasiclassical anomalies. In this section, we focus on the quasiclassical\nmemory effects in magnetotransport.\n2.1 Magnetoresistance of a 2DEG subject to smooth disorder\nWe begin by considering the MR of a 2DEG in the presence of Gaussian disorder which is smooth on the\nscale of kF\u22121 . First of all, we recall that there exists a finite MR [3, 4] even within the collision-integral\napproximation, the source of which is the bending of quasiclassical trajectories by magnetic field B on the\nscale of the correlation radius d. This leads to a small negative MR, \u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 \u223c \u2212(d/Rc )2 , where \u03c10 is\nthe Drude resistivity and Rc is the cyclotron radius. Remarkably, the non-Markovian kinetics gives rise to\na much stronger positive MR [5], which may even be much larger than unity.\nTo systematically treat the quasiclassical memory effects, the starting point is the disorder-averaged\nexpression for the conductivity tensor \u03c3 in terms of the exact Liouville operator L:\n*\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013T +\n\u0013\nZ\nd\u03c6\ncos \u03c6\ncos \u03c6\n\u22121\n2\n2\n.\n(1)\nL\n\u03c3 = e \u03bdvF\nsin \u03c6\nsin \u03c6\n2\u03c0\nHere \u03bd is the density of states, vF the Fermi velocity, \u03c6 the velocity angle on the Fermi surface. The\noperator L = L0 + \u03b4L is given by the sum of the free part L0 = \u2212i\u03c9 + vF n\u2207 + \u03c9c \u2202\u03c6 , where \u03c9c is the\ncyclotron frequency, n = (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6), and the part induced by a random scalar potential V (r),\n\u03b4L = \u03b4v(r)n\u2207 + [\u2207\u03b4v(r)](\u1e91 \u00d7 n)\u2202\u03c6 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4v(r) = v(r)\u2212vF denotes a fluctuation of the local Fermi velocity v(r) = [vF2 \u22122V (r)/m)]1/2 and\n\u1e91 is a unit vector in z direction. Expanding Eq. (1) in \u03b4L, averaging over the disorder and resumming the\nseries, the diagonal resistivity \u03c1xx = 2(\u2212i\u03c9 +Mxx)/e2 \u03bdvF2 is represented in terms of the disorder-induced\nself-energy (\"memory function\") Mxx .\n(0)\nThe Drude result Mxx = \u03c4tr\u22121 , where \u03c4tr is the momentum relaxation time, follows as the first term in a\n(0)\nperturbative expansion of the self-energy in the strength of disorder, Mxx = \u2212h\u03b4L L0\u22121 \u03b4Li. Substituting\n\u22121\n\u22121\nthe propagator LD renormalized by impurity scattering for L0 in the latter expression yields the main\ncontribution to the MR associated with the quasiclassical memory effects. When calculating L\u22121\nD in the\ncase of long-range disorder, the stochastic motion of particles can be approximated by a Fokker-Planck\nequation corresponding to the diffusion in momentum space, so that LD is written as\nLD = \u2212i\u03c9 + vF n\u2207 + \u03c9c \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c4tr\u22121 \u2202\u03c62 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe leading correction to Mxx due to the self-intersection of quasiclassical paths then reads:\nR\n\u2206Mxx = (4\u03c0 3 m2 vF2 )\u22121 d2 q d\u03c6 sin \u03c6 sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6q )q 2 W (q) gD (\u03c9, q, \u03c6) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere gD (\u03c9, q, \u03c6) is the Fourier-transformed real-space solution of the equation LD gD = sin \u03c6 sin(\u03c6 \u2212\n\u03c6q )\u03b4(r), \u03c6q is the angle of q, and W (q) is the Fourier transform of the correlator hV (0)V (r)i. For the\ncase of impurities separated from the 2DEG by a spacer of width d, Eq. (4) gives [5]\n(0)\n\u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = \u2206Mxx /Mxx\n= 2\u03c0 \u22121 \u03b6(3/2) (d/l)3 (\u03c9c \u03c4tr )9/2 .\n\n(5)\n\nOne sees that the MR due to the memory effects is much larger than that related to the effect of magnetic\nfield on the collision integral for \u03c9c \u03c4tr \u226b (l/d)2/5 . The MR (5) becomes of order unity when the meansquare shift of the guiding center of a cyclotron orbit after one revolution,\n\u03b4 = 2\u03c0 1/2 vF \u03c4tr /(\u03c9c \u03c4tr )3/2 ,\n\n(6)\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

At higher fields, the strong positive MR is followed\nby a sharp (exponential) falloff of \u03c1xx with growing B [6]:\nln(\u03c1xx /\u03c10 ) \u223c \u2212(d/\u03b4)2/3 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is due to the increasing adiabaticity of the electron dynamics and the related quasiclassical localization. The self-intersection induced MR, given by Eq. (5), may be considered as a precursor of the adiabatic\nlocalization.\nIn the limit of weak inhomogeneities, the return-induced MR depends in an essential way on the behavior of the disorder under time reversal [5]; in particular, it is strongly enhanced in a random magnetic field\n(RMF). The case of a smoothly varying RMF is of particular interest in view of the composite-fermion\ndescription of the transport properties of a half-filled Landau level [7]. Also, a long-range RMF has been\nrealized in semiconductor heterostructures by attaching superconducting or ferromagnetic overlayers or by\n\"prepatterning\" the sample (randomly curving the 2DEG layer). Following the same route as for the case\nof a random scalar potential, the MR due to the quasiclassical memory effects is obtained as [5]\n\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = 1/2 + [1/4 + (B/B0 )2 ]1/2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere B0 is the characteristic amplitude of fluctuations of the RMF. For the composite-fermion model at\nhalf-filling, (B/B0 )2 is represented as 2(d/l)(\u03c9c \u03c4tr )2 . The adiabatic localization in the RMF begins at\nB \u223c B0 (l/d)1/6 [8], so that there is a wide range of B in which the positive MR (8) is strong.\n3\n\n\u03b12\u22121/3\n\n5\n\n\u03b11\u22121/3\n\n\u03c1xx(B)/\u03c10\n\n\u03c1xx(B)/\u03c10\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b11=0.0138\n\u03b12=0.083\n\u03b13=0.2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nl/d=290\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n\u03c9c\u03c4\n\n1\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n8\n\n10\n\nB/B0\n\nFig. 1 Magnetoresistivity in a random potential from nu- Fig. 2 Magnetoresistivity in a random magnetic field\nmerical simulations in comparison with Eq.

(8).\n\nThe numerically calculated MR [5] for both types of disorder shown in Figs. 1 and 2 confirm the\ntheoretically predicted positive MR. Note that the MR in the RMF at moderately small d/l still exists, but\nbecomes weak; this is the region of d/l relevant to the composite-fermion model. The numerical data for\nd/l \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2 agree well [8] with the experimental results [9] for the MR around half-filling. Recent\n9/2\nunpublished numerical simulations [10] also confirm the \u03c9c positive MR in a smooth potential; however,\nthe numerical coefficient is found [10] to be smaller by a factor \u223c 2 as compared to Eq. (5).\n2.2 Magnetoresistance of a 2DEG subject to two-component disorder\nWe now turn to a 2DEG moving in a non-Gaussian random potential represented by rare strong shortrange scatterers and subject additionally to a smooth random potential discussed in Sec. 2.1. One of the\nmost relevant experimental realizations of the model of \"two-component disorder\" is random antidot (AD)\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f4\n\nI.A. Dmitriev et al.: Magnetotransport in quantum-Hall systems\n\narrays, where the potential barriers around the ADs can be modeled as hard disks reflecting electrons\nspecularly (for experimental work on the dc MR in random AD arrays see, e.g., Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n16]). The model is also applicable to the description of the MR in an unstructured ultra-high mobility 2DEG\nwith a wide spacer, where large-angle scattering on residual interface impurities and interface roughness\nbecomes important [17, 18, 19], limiting the mobility with further increasing width of the spacer. From the\ntheoretical point of view, the interplay of the two types of inhomogeneities is quite remarkable in that it\nyields nontrivial physics which is absent in the limiting cases, when only one type is present. In particular,\nalthough in the extreme of strong B \u2192 \u221e the resistivity \u03c1xx tends to zero in either of the limiting cases,\nit diverges in the presence of both types of disorder [20]. Also, in the experimentally relevant situation\nwhen the mean free path at zero B is determined by scattering on ADs, the presence of weak long-range\ndisorder will nonetheless become of crucial importance with increasing B [21, 20]. The magnetotransport\nin the Lorentz-gas model describing an AD array without smooth disorder has been studied, in particular,\nin Refs. [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. A strong negative MR followed by a metal-insulator phase transition in a\nstrong magnetic field was found in [22, 23, 25]; the low-field anomalous MR due to the \"corridor effect\"\nwas investigated in [26]. Smooth disorder, however, changes the MR qualitatively, as discussed below.\nGeneralizing the formalism described in Sec. 2.1 to the case of two-scale disorder, we represent the\nLiouville operator as L = LD + \u03b4L, where LD is given by Eq.

The Fourier transform I \u0303q of the collision operator IRi yields the\ntransport time \u03c4S for the scattering by the AD array of density nS through I \u03030 n = \u2212n/nS \u03c4S . We assume\n\u22121\nthat \u03c9c\u22121 \u226a \u03c4S \u226a \u03c4sm , so that the total transport rate is determined by ADs, \u03c4tr\u22121 = \u03c4S\u22121 + \u03c4sm\n\u2243 \u03c4S\u22121 .\nThe leading contribution to \u2206Mxx reads\nR\n(9)\n\u2206Mxx = \u2212nS (d\u03c6/\u03c0) cos \u03c6 IR DIR cos \u03c6 ,\n\nwhere the propagator D includes the first-order self-energy: D = (LD \u2212 nS I \u03030 )\u22121 . As compared to the\nLorentz model [27] in which only hard-disk scatterers are present, new physics emerges in the limit \u03b4 \u226b a,\nwhere a is the radius of the ADs and \u03b4 is the shift of the cyclotron orbit after one revolution due to scattering\non smooth disorder (cf. Sec. 2.1). In particular, Eq. (9) yields [21]\n\u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = \u2212(\u03c9c /\u03c90 )2 ,\n\n\u03c90 = (2\u03c0nS )1/2 vF (3\u03c4S /2\u03c4sm )1/4 ,\n\n(10)\n\nfor \u03c9c \u226a \u03c90 . The mechanism of the negative MR (10) can be understood as follows. If one associates with\na particle trajectory a strip of width 2a, the ratio (\u03c9c /\u03c90 )2 gives the fraction of the area \"explored\" twice,\nwhich implies an effective reduction of the exploration rate and thus a longer time between collisions with\ndifferent ADs. The negative MR (10) should be contrasted with the positive MR (5) for one-scale smooth\ndisorder, where the passages through the same area lead to an enhanced scattering rate.\nFor \u03c9c \u226b \u03c90 , the renormalized scattering time \u03c4S\u2032 \u226b \u03c4S should be found self-consistently from the\ncondition nS \u03beRc \u223c 1, where \u03be \u223c \u03b4(vF \u03c4S\u2032 /Rc )1/2 is a characteristic end-to-end size of the diffusive\nguiding-center trajectory in time \u03c4S\u2032 , which gives the B \u22124 falloff [21] with increasing B:\n\u03c1xx /\u03c10 \u223c \u03c4S /\u03c4S\u2032 \u223c (\u03c4S /\u03c4sm )(nS Rc2 )2 .\n\n(11)\n\nEquation (11) is valid as long as \u03c4S\u2032 \u226a \u03c4sm , which is rewritten as nS Rc2 \u226b 1. In the opposite limit (but still\nfor \u03b4 \u226a d), the scattering on ADs stops playing any role and \u03c1xx has a plateau with\n\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = \u03c4S /\u03c4sm .\n\n(12)\n\nLet us now briefly outline what happens at larger B, namely for \u03b4/d \u226a 1 [20]. In dilute AD arrays\nfor intermediate B, the exponential slowdown of the electron dynamics induced by adiabatic localization\ntransforms into \u03c1xx /\u03c10 \u223c nS Rc d ln(1/nS Rc d) \u221d B \u22121 ln B due to rare collisions with ADs which mix\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\fpss header will be provided by the publisher\n\n5\n\notherwise closed drift trajectories in phase space. Most interesting, however, is the behavior of \u03c1xx in\nthe limit of large B, where \u03c1xx starts to grow as a power law with increasing B. This behavior can be\nmost clearly seen in a \"hydrodynamic model\" of the chaotic AD array (nS \u2192 \u221e, \u03c4S = const), where\nthe problem can be mapped onto that of advection-diffusion transport [28]. In the limit B \u2192 \u221e the\nhydrodynamic model predicts \u03c1xx /\u03c10 \u223c (\u03c4S2 vF d/\u03c4sm Rc2 )5/13 \u221d B 10/13 . The physics of the positive MR\nis a percolation of drifting cyclotron orbits limited by scattering on ADs. The growth is checked on the side\nof large B by quantum effects (Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations). The different types of the MR in the twocomponent model [20] are illustrated in Fig. 3 for various concentrations of short-range scatterers (ADs):\n(i) the MR is positive owing to the \"diffusion-controlled percolation\"; (ii) due to the adiabatic localization,\nthe concentration of conducting electrons decreases as B \u22121 ln B before the percolation becomes effective,\nwhich yields a negative MR \u03c1xx (B) \u221d B \u22121 ln B for intermediate B; (iii) an exponentially sharp falloff of\n\u03c1xx (B) at B \u223c Bad (shown as a vertical jump) separates the diffusive and drift regimes; (iv) because of\nthe memory effects, the collision time for scattering by ADs is increased as compared to the Drude value\nalready in the diffusive regime (B \u226a Bad ), which leads to the negative MR \u03c1xx (B) \u221d B \u22124 for small B;\n(v) for intermediate B, the scattering on ADs stops playing any role and \u03c1xx (B) is saturated at a value\ndetermined by the long-range disorder only, whereas at larger fields the diffusion-controlled percolation\ngives rise to a positive MR.\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\n6\n5\n\n1.0\n=0\n\n4\n\n(v)\n\nB\n\nFig. 3 Schematic behavior of the magnetoresistivity\n\u03c1xx (B) on a log-log scale in the two-component disorder\nmodel for different values of the concentration of antidots n: n(i) > n(ii) > . . . > n(v) , keeping all other parameters (\u03c4S , \u03c4sm , d) fixed.

As far as the experimental data are\nconcerned, for typical parameters [13] of AD arrays, nS = (0.6 \u03bcm)\u22122 , vF \u03c4S = 1.3 \u03bcm, vF \u03c4sm = 16 \u03bcm,\nand the electron density 5 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , the field B0 corresponding to the frequency \u03c90 given by Eq.

Dmitriev et al.: Magnetotransport in quantum-Hall systems\n\n2.3 Quasiclassical memory effects in ac magnetotransport\nIn addition to the strong MR, the non-Markovian quasiclassical kinetics in the presence of long-range\ndisorder gives rise to an anomalous ac response. In particular, the return-induced correction to the ac\nconductivity Re \u03c3(\u03c9) exhibits a kink [30] \u221d |\u03c9| at \u03c9 \u2192 0. The quasiclassical zero-frequency anomaly is\nnot sensitive to inelastic scattering (in contrast to the weak-localization quantum correction) but manifests\nitself only [31] in the presence of an external metallic gate that screens the long-range Coulomb interaction.\nAs outlined below, in a strong B, the diagonal ac conductivity Re \u03c3xx (\u03c9) shows pronounced resonant\nfeatures [32, 33] on top of the cyclotron resonance (CR), which are induced by the memory effects.\nIn the Lorentz model (hard disks with no smooth disorder), which is intended to mimic a random\nAD array in heterostructures in the limit of a large spacer, the shape of the CR is very different from\nthe Lorentzian and not characterized by the Drude scattering rate [24, 32]. Altogether, the behavior of\nRe \u03c3xx (\u03c9) associated with quasiclassical cyclotron orbits skipping around the ADs turns out to be remarkably rich [32]. The skipping-orbit contribution is broadened on a scale of \u03c9c and vanishes at \u03c9c in a\nnonanalytical way as |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9c |. Apart from these two features, Re \u03c3xx (\u03c9) for moderately strong B with\nRc \u226b a oscillates with a period \u03c9c up to \u03c9 = \u03c9c Rc /a and shows a series of square-root spikes for larger\n\u03c9. The modulation yields exact zeros of the ac response at the harmonics of the CR.\nAdding a smooth random potential, present in typical heterostructures, changes the above picture in an\nessential way. Following the formalism of Sec. 2.2, the classical return-induced contribution to the real\n(c)\npart of the oscillatory ac conductivity \u03c3\u03c9 is represented for \u03c4S \u226a \u03c4sm and \u03b4 \u226b d as [33]\n\u03c3\u03c9(c) /\u03c3\u03c9D = \u2212Re P\u03c9 /nS \u03c4S ,\n\nP\u03c9 =\n\nP\u221e R\nn=1\n\ndt e\u2212i\u03c9t\u2212t/\u03c4S pn [ 0, vF (t \u2212 2\u03c0n/\u03c9c ) ] ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03c9D is the real part\ni conductivity, Eq.

In the case of a weak damping of\n(c)\nthe quasiclassical magnetooscillations, \u03c3\u03c9 is represented as a series of sharp dips at \u03c9 = N \u03c9c , whose\nD\n\u22121\namplitude and width are of order \u03c3 (a/N \u03b4)(\u03c9c \u03c4 )1/2 and \u03c4S\u22121 + N 2 \u03c4sm\n, respectively. In the regime of\n(c)\nharmonic oscillations (exponential damping), \u03c3\u03c9 is written as [33]\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3\u03c9(c) /\u03c3\u03c9D = 1 \u2212 (a/\u03c0 1/2 \u03b4) cos(2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03c9c ) exp \u2212(\u03c9/\u03c9c )2 (3\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4sm ) .\n\n(14)\n\nIt is worth stressing that these oscillations are of essentially classical origin and have nothing to do with\n(c)\nthe Landau quantization. The behavior of \u03c3\u03c9 is illustrated in Fig. 5, where also the quantum oscillations\n\u221d exp(\u22122\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4q ), with \u03c4q being the single-particle (quantum) relaxation time, are shown.

In a pioneering experiment [34]\nWeiss et al. discovered that a weak one-dimensional (1D) modulation with wave vector q k ex induces\nstrong commensurability oscillations of the magnetoresistivity \u03c1xx (B) (while showing almost no effect on\n\u03c1yy (B) and \u03c1xy (B)), with the minima satisfying the condition 2Rc /a = n \u2212 1/4, n = 1, 2, . . ., where\nRc is the cyclotron radius and a = 2\u03c0/q the modulation wave length. The quasiclassical nature of these\ncommensurability oscillations was demonstrated by Beenakker [35], who showed that the interplay of the\ncyclotron motion and the superlattice potential induces a drift of the guiding center along y axis, with\nan amplitude squared oscillating as cos2 (qRc \u2212 \u03c0/4) (this is also reproduced by a quantum-mechanical\ncalculation, see [36]). While describing nicely the period and the phase of the experimentally observed\noscillations, the result of [35], however, failed to explain the observed rapid decay of the oscillation amplitude with decreasing magnetic field. The cause for this discrepancy was in the treatment of disorder: while\nRef. [35] assumed isotropic impurity scattering, in experimentally relevant high-mobility semiconductor\nheterostructures the random potential is very smooth and induces predominantly small-angle scattering,\n\u22121\nwith the total relaxation rate \u03c4q\u22121 much exceeding the momentum relaxation rate \u03c4tr\n. The theory of\ncommensurability oscillations in one-dimensional modulation, V (x) = \u03b7EF cos qx with \u03b7 \u226a 1, in the\nsituation of smooth disorder was worked out in [37].\nThe starting point is the Boltzmann equation for the distribution function F (x, n) of electrons,\nLF (x, n) = \u2212ev(x)En ;\n\nL = v(x)n\u2202r + \u03c9c \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6v \u2032 (x)\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 C ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere n = (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6) is the direction and v(x) = [2m(EF + eU (x))]1/2 the magnitude of the Fermi\nvelocity, and C is the collision integral. The resulting modulation-induced contribution to resistivity reads\n[37]\n\"\n\u0013\u22121/2 #\n\u0012\n\u03c4q 2\n\u03b7 2 ql\n\u03c0\nQ\n\u2206\u03c1xx\n, (16)\n1\u2212 1+\n=\nQ\nQ\nJi\u03bc (Q)J\u2212i\u03bc (Q) ;\n\u03bc=\n\u03c10\n4\nsinh \u03c0\u03bc\nqvF \u03c4q\n\u03c4tr\nwhere we introduced the dimensionless parameter Q = qRc convenient to characterize the strength of the\nmagnetic field. At low magnetic fields, Q \u226b Qdis , with Qdis = (2ql/\u03c0)1/3 , the oscillations are exponentially damped by disorder, and the magnetoresistivity saturates at the value \u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = \u03b7 2 ql/4. (At still\nlower magnetic fields, Q > Qch , with Qch = 2/\u03b7, and for a sufficiently strong modulation, \u03b7 3/2 ql \u226b 1,\nan additional strong magnetoresistivity occurs, dominated by the channeled orbits, see Sec. 3.3.) In strong\nfields, Q \u226a Qdis , the amplitude of oscillations increases as B 3 ,\n\u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = [(\u03b7ql)2 /\u03c0Q3 ] cos2 (Q \u2212 \u03c0/4) .\n\n(17)\n\nIn Fig. 6 the theoretical results are compared with experimental data of Weiss et al [34]. The sample\nparameters are [34] q = 2\u03c0/382nm, ne = 3.16 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , \u03c4tr = 52ps, the total relaxation rate is\ntaken to be \u03c4q\u22121 = (3ps)\u22121 . As is seen from the figure, with the modulation strength \u03b7 = 0.065 a\nvery good description of the experimentally observed magnetoresistivity is obtained. (At lowest B, the\nexperimental data show positive magnetoresistance discussed in Sec. 3.3.) The difference between the\nlong-range potential scattering and the isotropic scattering is illustrated in the right panel, where the results\nfor the modulation-induced \u2206\u03c1xx are plotted for both models of disorder at the same value of \u03c4tr . As was\nshown in [38], modulation-induced commensurability oscillations can be also observed in attenuation and\nvelocity change of a surface acoustic wave propagating near a 2DEG.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The sample parameters (q = 2\u03c0/382nm, ne =\n3.16 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 ) are the same as in Ref.[34].\n\nIn [39] Weiss oscillations were studied for the vicintiy of the \u03bd = 1/2 filling of the lowest Landau level;\nsee also related works [40, 41]. Within the composite fermion theory, the problem is described in terms\nof fermions subject to a spatially modulated magnetic field and scattered by a random magnetic field. The\nmagnetic character of modulation shifts the phase of Weiss oscillations, while the random magnetic fields\nconsiderably enhances their damping. The obtained results are in agreement with experimental studies\n[42, 43], which confirms the validity of the composite-fermion description of the \u03bd = 1/2 state.\n3.2 Two-dimensional superlattices\nMagnetotransport in 2D superlattices with small-angle impurity scattering was studied in [44]. It was\nshown that the shape of the magnetoresistivity depends crucially on the parameter \u03b3 = \u03b7 2 ql/4.\nFor small \u03b3 (corresponding typically to a modulation strength not exceeding a few percent) the magnetoresistivity is given by the perturbative formulas (16) \u2013 (17) (the same as in 1D superlattices) up to the\npoint Q \u223c QP \u2261 [0.13(\u03b7ql)2 ]1/3 , where the correction \u2206\u03c1xx becomes of the order of the Drude resistivity\n\u03c10 . For higher magnetic fields the P\u00e9clet number P \u223c \u03b7ql/(qRc )3/2 characterizing the advection-diffusion\nproblem becomes large and the transport is determined by a narrow boundary layer around a square network of separatrices. As a result, the B 3 -dependence of the oscillation amplitude characteristic for the\nperturbative (Q > QP ) regime crosses over to a much slower B 3/4 -increase at Q < QP ,\n\u2206\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = (8\u03c0)1/4 C(\u03b7ql)1/2 Q\u22123/4 | cos(Q \u2212 \u03c0/4)|1/2 .\n\n(18)\n\nFor \u03b3 \u226b 1 (which is typically valid for the modulation strength \u03b7 larger than 10 \u00f7 15%) the oscillations\nare damped at low magnetic fields not by disorder (as in the perturbative regime) but by the modulationinduced chaotic diffusion.

At B \u223c Bad\nthe disorder starts to dominate over the non-adiabatic effects, leading\n3/4\nto a B -increase of the oscillation amplitude.\n\n3.3 Low-field magnetoresistance\nA distinct low-field magnetoresistivity was observed, along with the commensurability oscillations, in the\noriginal experiment [34], as well as in numerous later experiments on the transport in a lateral superlattice.\nSpecifically, in low magnetic fields B a positive magnetoresistivity was found, followed by a maximum\nin \u03c1xx (B). For not too strong modulation, the relevant magnetic fields are much weaker than those where\nthe Weiss oscillations are observed, so that the two effects can be easily separated. Soon after the first\nexperimental observation it was understood [47] (see also [46]) that the low-field magnetoresistivity is\nrelated to the existence of open (channeled) orbits in the magnetic fields B < Bc = (\u03b7c/2e)qmvF . It is\nworth mentioning that this effect, which is not found within the \u03b7-expansion used in Refs. [35, 37], has its\ncounterpart in the context of the sound absorption in metals in the presence of a magnetic field. There, the\ntrapping of electrons in channeled orbits by a sound wave leads to non-linearity of the acoustic response of\nan electron gas, as was observed experimentally [48] and analyzed theoretically [49].\nA quantitative analytical description of the problem in the presence of disorder was worked out in [45].\nIt was found that for a suffuciently strong modulation, \u03b7 3/2 ql \u226b 1, the contribution of channeled orbits to\nresistivity has the form\n\u221a\n2 7/2\n(ql)2 Fch (\u03b2) ,\n(20)\n\u2206\u03c1ch\nxx /\u03c10 = ( 2/\u03c0 )\u03b7\nwhere \u03b2 = B/Bc and Fch (\u03b2) is a parameterless function shown in the left panel of Fig. 8. This induces a\nlow-field magnetoresistance that scales as \u03b7 7/2 with the modulation strength. It was further shown in [45]\nthat the contribution of non-channeled orbits is also modified at B .

There are several distinct sources of a non-trivial MR, which reflect the rich physics of 2D systems.\nFirst, quasiclassical memory effects may lead to a MR(see Sec.2), which shows no T -dependence at low\ntemperatures. Second, weak localization [51] induces a negative quantum MR restricted to the range of\nweak magnetic fields. Another quantum-mechanical source of the MR is electron\u2013electron interaction.\nThis type of the MR is the subject of the present Section.\nIt was discovered by Altshuler and Aronov [51] that the Coulomb interaction enhanced by the diffusive\nmotion of electrons gives rise to a quantum correction to conductivity, which has in 2D the form \u03b4\u03c3xx \u2243\n(e2 /2\u03c0 2 ) ln T \u03c4tr (it is assumed here for simplicity that \u03ba \u226a kF , where \u03ba = 4\u03c0e2 \u03bd0 is the inverse screening\nlength; we also set kB = ~ = 1). The condition T \u03c4tr \u226a 1 under which this result is derived [51] implies\nthat electrons move diffusively on the time scale 1/T and is termed the \"diffusive regime\". Subsequent\nwork [52] showed that in a strong magnetic field this correction (in combination with \u03b4\u03c3xy = 0) gives rise\nto a parabolic interaction\u2013induced quantum MR,\n\u03b4\u03c1xx (B)/\u03c10 \u2243 [(\u03c9c \u03c4tr )2 \u2212 1](\u03c0kF l)\u22121 ln T \u03c4tr ,\n\nT \u03c4tr \u226a 1,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c9c = eB/mc is the cyclotron frequency and l = vF \u03c4tr the transport mean free path.\nThe effect of interaction on the conductivity in the \"ballistic regime\" T > 1/\u03c4tr has attracted a great deal\nof interest in a context of 2D systems showing a seemingly metallic behavior, d\u03c1/dT > 0 [53, 54]. Zala,\nNarozhny, and Aleiner [55] developed a systematic theory of the interaction corrections valid for arbitrary\nT \u03c4tr . In the ballistic range of temperatures, this theory predicts a linear-in-T correction to conductivity \u03c3xx\nand a 1/T correction to the Hall coefficient \u03c1xy /B at B \u2192 0, and describes the MR in a parallel field.\nThe consideration of [55] is restricted, however, to classically weak transverse fields, \u03c9c \u03c4tr \u226a 1, and to the\nwhite-noise disorder.\nIn this Section, we present a general theory of the interaction\u2013induced corrections to the conductivity\ntensor of 2D electrons valid for arbitrary T , B and type of disorder [56]. A general expression for \u03b4\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\nis derived in terms of the ballistic propagator D(\u03c9, q; n, n\u2032 ) describing the quasiclassical propagation of\nan electron in the phase space (n is the unit vector characterizing the direction of velocity on the Fermi\nsurface).

At B \u2192 0 one recovers the results\nfor \u03b4\u03c3xx and \u03c1xy obtained in a different way in [55] for a white-noise disorder. Needless to say, in the\ndiffusive limit, Eqs. (23), (24) reproduce (for arbitrary B and disorder range) the logarithmic correction\n(22).\nThe structure of Eqs. (23), (24) implies that the interaction correction is governed by returns of a particle\nto the original point in a time t < T \u22121 \u226a \u03c4tr . In a smooth random potential with a correlation length d \u226b\nkF\u22121 the return probability is exponentially suppressed for t \u226a \u03c4tr . Therefore, the interaction correction in\nthe ballistic regime is exponentially small at B = 0 for the case of smooth disorder. Moreover, the same\nargument applies to the case of a non-zero B, as long as \u03c9c \u226a T .\nThe situation changes qualitatively in a strong B, \u03c9c \u226b T, \u03c4tr\u22121 : the particle experiences within the time\nt \u223c T \u22121 multiple cyclotron returns to the region close to the starting point. The MR is then determined by\nthe correction to \u03c3xx . For the Coulomb interaction, the exchange contribution to the MR is given by\n\u03b4\u03c1xx /\u03c10 = \u2212(\u03c9c \u03c4tr )2 GF (T \u03c4tr )/\u03c0kF l.\n\n(25)\n\nFor the point-like interaction a similar result is obtained, with the replacement GF (T \u03c4tr ) \u2192 \u03bd0 U0 G0 (T \u03c4tr ).\nThe functions G0 (T \u03c4tr ) and GF (T \u03c4tr ), governing the T -dependence of the MR, are shown in Fig. 9.

This is a typical situation for high-mobility GaAs\nstructures with sufficiently large spacer d. It is known, however, that with further increasing width of\nthe spacer the large-angle scattering on residual impurities and interface roughness becomes important\nand limits the mobility (see Sec. 2.2). Furthermore, in Si-based structures the transport relaxation rate is\nusually governed by scattering on short-range impurities. This suggests considering the two-component\nmodel of disorder: white-noise random potential with a mean free time \u03c4wn and a smooth random potential\n\u22121\n+\nwith a transport relaxation time \u03c4sm . It is assumed that while the transport relaxation rate \u03c4tr\u22121 = \u03c4wn\n\u22121\n\u03c4sm\nis governed by short-range disorder, \u03c4wn \u226a \u03c4sm , the damping of SdHO is dominated by smooth\nrandom potential. This allows one to consider the range of classically strong magnetic fields, \u03c9c \u03c4wn \u226b 1,\nneglecting at the same time Landau quantization.\nThe presence of short-range scatterers enhances the MR as compared to the case of smooth disorder.\nFor the point-like interaction the MR reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(\u03c9c \u03c4tr )2 \u03bd0 U0 mix\n\u03c4sm\n\u03b4\u03c1xx (B)\n,\n=\u2212\nG0\nT \u03c4tr ,\n\u03c10\n\u03c0kF l\n\u03c4tr\n\nGmix\n0 (x, \u03b3)\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2212 ln x + (2\u03b3)1/2 ,\n4c0 \u03b3 1/2 x\u22121/2 ,\n\nx \u226a 1,\nx \u226b 1.\n\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Finally, the ballistic contribution to \u03c1xy is also enhanced by a factor\n\u223c (\u03c4sm /\u03c4tr )1/2 in the mixed disorder model.\nThe formalism can be further applied to anisotropic systems. The interaction-induced correction mixes\nthe components \u03c1xx and \u03c1yy of the resistivity tensor. This result is of special interest in the case of systems subject to a one-dimensional periodic modulation (lateral superlattice, Sec. 3; wave vector k k ex ).\nSpecifically, it has been shown that the interaction induces novel oscillations in \u03c1yy , which are in phase\nwith quasiclassical commensurability (Weiss) oscillations in \u03c1xx .\n\n5 Influence of Landau quantization on magnetotransport\nIn this section, we address magnetooscillations in the dissipative dc and ac conductivity of a 2DEG governed by the Landau quantization. Despite these effects, to the first place, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations\n(SdHO), are well established experimentally, the theoretical description until recently was only available\n[59] for fully separated Landau levels (LLs) with point-like scatterers [60]. A systematic approach to the\nproblem was developed in Ref. [61]. The results of this work, valid also for overlapping LLs, and for\nexperimentally relevant case of smooth disorder, with the correlation length d \u226b kF\u22121 , are reviewed below.\nWithin the quasiclassical Boltzmann theory, the dissipative ac conductivity \u03c3\u03c9 = \u03c3+ (\u03c9) + \u03c3\u2212 (\u03c9) of a\nnon-interacting 2DEG is given by the Drude formula (we neglect spin for simplicity),\nD\n2\n\u03c3\u00b1\n(\u03c9) = (1/4)e2 \u03bd0 vF2 \u03c4tr /[1 + (\u03c9c \u00b1 \u03c9)2 \u03c4tr\n],\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bd0 = m/2\u03c0 and \u03c4tr are the density of states (DOS) and the transport relaxation time at B = 0,\n\u03c9c = eB/mc the cyclotron frequency, and m is the electron effective mass. We consider a 2DEG subjected to quantizing magnetic field B and a random potential U (r) characterized by a correlation function\nhU (r)U (r\u2032 )i = W (|r \u2212 r\u2032 |).

[64]. In addition to experimental motivation related to\nthe apparent metal-insulator transition in two-dimensional systems, the corresponding theory complements\nthe recently developed theory of interaction effects in transport of 2D electrons in zero and non-quantizing\nmagnetic fields [55, 56].\nThe starting point is the expression for the thermodynamic potential derived in the paper by Luttinger\nand Ward [65]\n\u03a9 = \u2212T Tr ln(\u2212G\u22121 ) \u2212 T Tr(G\u03a3) + \u03a9\u2032 ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the trace implies summation over Landau levels N and over fermionic Matsubara frequencies \u01ebn =\n(2n + 1)i\u03c0T , G(i\u01ebn , N \u03c9c ) = [i\u01ebn + \u03bc \u2212 (N + 1/2)\u03c9c \u2212 \u03a3(i\u01ebn , N \u03c9c )]\u22121 is the dressed Matsubara\nGreen's function, and \u03a3(i\u01ebn , N \u03c9c ) is a self-energy part of Green's function which includes all the disorder\nand interaction effects. The terms \u2212T Tr(G\u03a3) and \u03a9\u2032 in (41) are introduced to avoid double-counting of\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f16\n\nI.A.

Diagrams (b) represent the \"Hikami-box\" contribution to the self-energy which restores the\ngauge-invariance of the damping.\n\ndiagrams [65, 66]. The term \u03a9\u2032 denotes the sum of all so-called skeleton diagrams with all bare Green's\nfunctions replaced by dressed Green's functions.\nAs shown in Ref. [67], the exponential decay of magnetooscillations is described by the Tr ln-term.\nThe oscillatory parts of the additional terms, which are introduced to correct for overcounting, cancel each\nother. In order to obtain the correction to the thermodynamic potential one needs to calculate the selfenergy part of the Green's function. It is worth noting that the inelastic contribution to the self-energy \u221d\n[(\u03c0T )2 \u2212 \u01eb2n ]sign\u01ebn vanishes for \u01ebn = \u03c0T, and thus does not affect the damping of the magnetooscillations\nB(T ) for T \u226b \u03c9c , in agreement with Refs. [68, 69].\nFor overlapping Landau levels [Eq. (34)], the magnetooscillations are damped by disorder even at zero\ntemperature via the standard Dingle factor \u03b4 = exp(\u2212\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4q ). Therefore we will consider only the\nfirst harmonics of the oscillations, A1 , neglecting all higher harmonics whose damping is much stronger.\nIn what follows we concentrate on the case T \u226b \u03c9c . Under this condition, the first harmonics of the\noscillatory part of the thermodynamic potential\n2\n\n\u03a9osc \u2243 2\u03bd0 (\u03c9c /2\u03c0) A1 cos(2\u03c0 2 ne /eB),\n\n(42)\n\nis given by\n\u0003\n\u0002\nA1 = (4\u03c0 2 T /\u03c9c ) exp \u22122\u03c0 2 T /\u03c9c\u2217 \u2212 \u03c0/\u03c9c\u2217 \u03c4q\u2217 exp[B(T )],\n\n(43)\n\nB(T ) = \u22122\u03c0i Z \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03c0T, \u03be0 )/\u03c9c\u2217 .\n\n(44)\n\nwhich is a standard FL Lifshitz-Kosevich expression multiplied by the additional factor with\n\nHere \u03c9c\u2217 = eB/m\u2217 is the Fermi-liquid (FL) renormalized effective cyclotron frequency in a pure system\nat zero T , which is related to the FL-renormalized effective mass m\u2217 , Z is the FL Z-factor (given by\nthe residue of the Green's function), \u03c4q\u2217 is the FL-renormalized scattering time, and \u03b4\u03a3(i\u01ebn , \u03be0 ) is the\nself-energy part (taken at the pole \u03be0 of the Green's function in the presence of disorder) describing the\ninterplay of disorder and interaction.\nHereafter white-noise disorder with \u03c4tr = \u03c4q \u2261 \u03c4 is considered. Evaluating the sum of six digrams\n(Fig. 14) for \u03b4\u03a3, one gets the following expression for the damping exponent in the case of short-range\ninteraction U0 :\nB(T ) = \u2212const \u03bd0 U0 (\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4q ) + (\u03c0T /\u03c9c ) (\u03bd0 U0 /\u03b5F \u03c4 ) ln(\u03b5F /T ).\n\n(45)\n\nThe first term in Eq. (45) describes the T -independent FL-renormalization of \u03c4q due to vertex corrections\nand should be included in the effective relaxation time \u03c4q\u2217 . The second term represents the T -dependent\ncontribution to the damping factor that we are interested in and is analyzed below.\nThe above result (45) can be interpreted in terms of corrections to the effective mass (or \u03c9c ) and the\nquantum elastic scattering rate \u03c4q entering the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. These corrections come\nfrom the interplay of disorder and interaction, leading to\nB(T ) = \u2212(2\u03c0 2 T /\u03c9c )(\u03b4m/m) \u2212 (\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4q ) [\u03b4m/m \u2212 \u03b4\u03c4q /\u03c4q ] .\n\n(46)\n\nIt is worth noting that the FL-renormalization does not affect the product \u03c9c m = eB.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\fpss header will be provided by the publisher\n\n17\n\nComparing (45) and (46), one can see that the T ln T dependence of the damping factor could in principle originate either from the ln T correction to the effective mass, or from the T ln T -type correction to\n\u03c4q . This led the authors of Ref. [68] to the conclusion that the nonlinear T \u2212dependence of the damping\nfactor may be equivalently interpreted either as a T \u2212dependent renormalization of the effective mass or\nas a T \u2212dependent Dingle temperature. It is clear, however, that these two possibilities correspond to different physical processes. To identify the physical origin of the leading contribution to the damping it is\ninstructive to obtain B(T ) using the expression for the self-energy analytically continued to real values of\nenergies \u01ebn \u2192 \u2212i\u03b5 .\nHaving calculated Re\u03a3 and Im\u03a3 for real energies \u03b5, one can determine \u03b4m and \u03b4\u03c4q . Indeed, the magnitude of the first harmonics of the magnetooscillations of the thermodynamic density of states is expressed\nthrough the real-\u03b5 self-energy \u03b4\u03a3(\u03b5) as follows:\nZ\nA1 (T ) = \u2212 d\u03b5A1 (\u03b5, T )\u2202\u03b5 fT (\u03b5),\n(47)\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0i\n[\u03b5 \u2212 Re\u03b4\u03a3(\u03b5, \u03be0 )] exp \u2212\n+\nIm\u03b4\u03a3(\u03b5, \u03be0 )\n(48)\nA1 (\u03b5, T ) = exp\n\u03c9c\n\u03c9c \u03c4q\n\u03c9c\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c0\n\u03b4m(\u03b5, T )\n\u03b4m(\u03b5, T ) \u03b4\u03c4q (\u03b5, T )\n2\u03c0i\u03b5\nexp \u2212\n1+\n1+\n.\n(49)\n= exp\n\u2212\n\u03c9c\nm\n\u03c9c \u03c4q\nm\n\u03c4q\nwhere fT (\u03b5) = [1 + exp(\u03b5/T )]\u22121 is the Fermi distribution function. This allows one to express \u03b4\u03c4q (\u03b5, T )\nand \u03b4m(\u03b5, T ) through Re\u03a3(\u03b5) and Im\u03a3(\u03b5) as follows:\n\u03b4m(\u03b5, T )/m = \u2212\u03b5\u22121 Re\u03b4\u03a3(\u03b5, T ) = \u2212(\u03bd0 U0 /2\u03c0\u03b5F \u03c4 ) ln{\u03b5F /max[|\u03b5|, T ]},\n\u03b4\u03c4q (\u03b5, T )/\u03c4q = 2\u03c4q Im\u03b4\u03a3(\u03b5, T ) + \u03b4m(\u03b5, T )/m\nh\n\u0010 \u03b5 \u0011i\n\u03bd0 U 0\nT\n\u03b5F\n\u2212\n= \u03bd0 U 0\nln 2 cosh\nln\n.\n\u03b5F\n2T\n2\u03c0\u03b5F \u03c4\nmax[|\u03b5|, T ]\n\n(50)\n\n(51)\n\nIt is clear from these results that the leading term in B(T ) [proportional to T ln(\u03b5F /T ), Eq. (45)] originates from the real part of the self-energy, i.e. from renormalization of the effective mass, which affects\nincommensurability of the oscillations at different values of energy \u03b5. The contribution of the imaginary\npart of the self-energy, which is governed in the ballistic regime by the renormalization of the scattering\ntime, is smaller by a factor ln(\u03b5F \u03c4 ). The obtained result for the interaction-induced correction to the quantum scattering time \u03c4q , Eq. (51), agrees, up to a factor 12 , with the correction to the transport time following\nfrom the calculation of conductivity correction in the ballistic regime in Ref. [55].\nIn the case of Coulomb interaction, one should take into account the dynamical screening of the interaction within the random phase approximation (RPA). This leads to different asymptotics of the self-energy\nin the diffusive and ballistic regimes, in contrast to the case of weak short-range interaction. The T dependence of the leading correction to the magnetooscillations damping factor due to the interaction in\nthe singlet channel has the form (Fig. 15)\n\uf8f1\n4\u03c0T \u03c4 \u226a 1,\n\uf8f2 (3/2) ln(\u03b5F /T ) \u2212 (1/2) ln(4\u03c0\u03b5F \u03c4 ),\n\u03c0\nT\nB \u03c1 (T ) =\n(52)\n\u00d7\n\uf8f3\n\u03c9c \u03c4q \u03b5F\nln(\u03b5F /T ),\n4\u03c0T \u03c4 \u226b 1.\nCalculation of the corresponding triplet contribution leads to qualitatively similar asymptotics. The leading\nterm in the total correction to the damping factor in the ballistic regime, realized in experiments on lowdisorder samples at realistic temperatures, takes the simple form\nB(T ) = B \u03c1 (T ) + B \u03c3 (T ) \u2243 [1 + 3F0\u03c3 (1 + F0\u03c3 )\u22121 ] (\u03c0T /\u03c9c \u03c4q \u03b5F ) ln(\u03b5F /T ).\n\n(53)\n\nAs discussed above, this result arises due to the correction to the effective mass.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The drag signal is the voltage V developing in the\nopen-circuit passive layer when a current I is applied in the active layer. The drag resistance (also known\nas transresistance) is then defined by RD = V /I. As a function of interlayer spacing a, the interlayer\ncoupling changes from weak at large spacings where it can be treated in perturbation theory, to strong at\nsmall spacings where it can result in states with strong interlayer correlations [76, 77].\nIn a simple picture of Coulomb drag, the carriers of the active layer transfer momentum to the carriers\nof the passive layer by interlayer electron-electron scattering. The phase space for interlayer scattering is\nproportional to the temperature T in either layer predicting a monotonous temperature dependence RD \u221d\nT 2 of the drag resistance. Moreover, the signs of the voltages in active and passive layer are expected to\nbe opposite (the same) for carriers of equal (opposite) charge in the two layers [80].\nRemarkably, experiments show that Coulomb drag behaves very differently from these simple expectations when a perpendicular magnetic field B is applied such that the Fermi energy \u03b5F is in a high Landau\nlevel, \u03b5F /~\u03c9c \u226b 1. (\u03c9c is the cyclotron frequency.) Several experiments [74, 78] in the regime of weak\ninterlayer coupling observed negative drag when the filling factors in the two layers are different. A more\nrecent experiment [79] also reveals a non-monotonic dependence on temperature. While the drag resistivity shows a quadratic temperature dependence at sufficiently high temperatures, where drag is always\npositive, an additional peak develops at low temperatures which can have both a positive or a negative sign\ndepending on the filling-factor difference between the two layers.\nIn this Section, we present the theory of Coulomb drag in the limit of high Landau levels [82]. In\na strong magnetic field, \u03c9c \u03c4tr \u226b 1, the intralayer Hall resistivity \u03c1xy dominates over the longitudinal\nresistivity \u03c1xx . Therefore, the drag resistivity is given by\n(1) D (2)\n\u03c1D\nxx \u2243 \u03c1xy \u03c3yy \u03c1yx\n\n(54)\n\nThe Coulomb drag in strong magnetic fields is an interplay of two contributions, as illustrated in Fig. 16.\nAt high temperatures, the leading contribution is due to breaking of particle-hole symmetry by the curvature\nof the zero-B electron spectrum. This \"normal\" contribution to the drag is always positive and increases\nin a broad temperature range as T 2 . At low temperatures, another, \"anomalous\", contribution dominates,\nwhich arises from the breaking of particle-hole symmetry by the energy dependence of the density of\nstates related to Landau quantization. This contribution is sharply peaked at a temperatute T \u223c \u2206 (where\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the particle-hole (p-h) symmetric case, the electronic and\nhole contributions to the current induced in the passive layer (je and jh , respectively) compensate each other. When\nthe p-h asymmetry is generated by a finite curvature, the velocities of electrons and holes (shown by arrows in the right\npanel) are different, which destroys the compensation. This is the \"conventional\" mechanism of the drag. When the\nDoS depends on energy (in the present case because of the LL-quantization), an \"anomalous\" drag arises due to the\ndifference in numbers of occupied electronic and hole states.\n\n2\n\nT\n\nT lnT\n\n2\n\nT\n\n1\n\nT\n\n\u03c1xxD (T)\n\nT\n\n\u2206\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n\u2212T lnT\n\n1/2\n\nT\n\nT**\n\u2212T\n\na\n\n\u2212T\n\n2\n\nT\n\n1\n\nT\n\n3\n\nT\n\n\u2206\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1/2\n\n\u2206\n\n\u22121\nT\n\nb\n\n\u2212T\n\n2\n\nT*\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n1\n\nT\n\nT\n\n1\n\nT\n\n1\n\nT3\n\n2\n\n\u2206\nmatched\nmismatched\n\nc\n\nd\n\nFig. 17 Schematic temperature dependence of low-temperature drag in different regimes: a) diffusive, Rc /a \u226a 1; b)\nweakly ballistic, 1 \u226a Rc /a \u226a \u03c9c /\u2206; c) ballistic, \u03c9c /\u2206 \u226a Rc /a \u226a N \u2206/\u03c9c ; d) ultra-ballistic, N \u2206/\u03c9c \u226a Rc /a.\n\n\u2206 = 2\u0393 is the Landau level width) and has an oscillatory sign depending on the density mismatch between\nthe two layers.\nSince the momenta transferred from one layer to the other are effectively restricted by the inverse interlayer distance, a\u22121 , the behavior of the transresistivity will be essentially dependent on the relation\nbetween Rc and a.

In all regimes, the temperature-dependence of the drag resistivity is nonmonotonous: the absolute value of \u03c1D\nxx (T ) shows a peak around T \u223c \u2206 and increases again at T \u226b \u03c9c .\nHowever, the T \u2212 and B\u2212 dependences of \u03c1D\nxx , as well as the sign of the low-temperature peak (the hightemperature drag is always positive), are specific for each particular regime, as illustrated in Fig. 17 and\nsummarized below.\nDiffusive regime, Rc /a \u226a 1. In the diffusive regime, the drag at not too high temperatures, T \u226a\n\u03c9c , is governed by the diffusive rectification[81] which can be calculated quasiclassically using the local\napproximation for the density dependence of the conductivity. As a result, the sign of the drag at T \u223c \u2206\noscillates but is opposite to what we found above for the ballistic regime: the drag is negative for equal\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In both the theory and the experiment, (i) \u03c1D\nxx (T ) shows a\nsharp peak at low temperatures; (ii) the sign of the drag in this temperature range oscillates as a function\nof the filling factor of one layer (at fixed filling factor of the other layer); (iii) the low-T drag is positive for\nequal filling factors and negative when the Fermi energy in one layer is in the upper half and in the other\nlayer in the lower half of the Landau band; (iv) the high-T drag is always positive, independently of the\ndifference in filling factors of two layers and increases monotonically with increasing T . Furthermore, it\nwas observed by Muraki et al that in the low-temperature regime of initial increase of \u03c1D\nxx , as well as in the\nhigh-temperature regime of \"normal\" drag, the drag resistivity can be described by an empirical scaling\n\u22122.7\nlaw, \u03c1D\nf (T /B).

Subsequent work on samples with an exceptionally high mobility has shown\n[84, 85] that for a sufficiently high radiation power the minima of these microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO) evolve into \"zero resistance states\"(ZRS), in which the dissipative resistance of a sample\nbecomes vanishingly small. Unlike oscillatory \u03c1xx , the Hall resistivity \u03c1xy remained practically linear in\n\u03c9c . A hallmark of these experimental findings is that the prominent oscillations of the photoconductivity\n\u03c3ph \u2243 \u03c1xx /\u03c12xy are observed at magnetic fields as low as 10 mT, and at relatively high temperatures up to\n\u223c 1 K, at which the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are completely suppressed.\nPresenting a novel class of magnetooscillations which lead, with increasing \u03c9c , to apparently dissipationless transport, the experimental results [83, 84, 85] have attracted much theoretical interest. In particular, an explanation of the MIRO has been proposed [86] in terms of a combined effect of radiation and\nLandau quantization on elementary scattering acts for electrons colliding with impurities (in fact, a closely\nrelated theory was put forward long ago [87]). A systematic theoretical study of this mechanism of the\nMIRO (referred to as a \"displacement\" mechanism in what follows) was carried out in [88].\nOn the other hand, it was emphasized [89] that whenever the linear dc response theory predicts a negative resistivity, this signifies an instability leading to the formation of domains of counter-flowing currents.\nThe break-up of an ac-driven sample in current domains provides an explanation to the experimentally\nobserved ZRS.\nA different mechanism of the MIRO, called here the \"inelastic\" mechanism, was proposed in [61] and\nstudied in more detail in [90, 91] (similar ideas were also discussed in [92]). The inelastic mechanism\nis associated with a radiation-induced non-equilibrium part of the distribution function of electrons f (\u03b5)\nwhich oscillates with varying \u03b5 \u00b1 ~\u03c9 due to the Landau quantization. This mechanism yields the amplitude of oscillations of the linear (with respect to the dc field) photoconductivity which is proportional\nto inelastic scattering time \u03c4in . The inelastic contribution dominates over the displacement one for \u03c4in\nlarger than single-particle relaxation time \u03c4q , the condition which is fulfilled in the experiments. Apart\nfrom the magnitude of the effect, the two contributions are qualitatively different in their dependence on\nT and polarization of the radiation. In accord with the experiments, the inelastic contribution decreases as\n\u03c4in \u221d T \u22122 with increasing T and does not depend on the direction of linear polarization of the microwave\nfield. By contrast, the displacement mechanism [86, 87, 88] yields a T independent contribution which\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f22\n\nI.A. Dmitriev et al.: Magnetotransport in quantum-Hall systems\n\ndepends essentially on the relative orientation of the microwave and dc fields, which clearly contradicts the\nexperimental findings.\n7.2 Inelastic mechanism of MIRO\nWe consider a high-mobility 2DEG, with \u03c4q \u226a \u03c4tr , subjected to a classically strong transverse magnetic\nfield, \u03c9c \u03c4tr \u226b 1 (we use notations of Sec. 5, in particular, \u03c4q and \u03c4tr are specified in Eq. (31). The\nphotoconductivity \u03c3ph determines the longitudinal current flowing in response to a dc electric field Edc ,\n~j * E~dc = \u03c3ph E 2 , in the presence of a microwave electric field E\u03c9 cos \u03c9t. The more frequently measured\ndc\n[83, 84, 85, 92] longitudinal resistivity, \u03c1ph , is given by \u03c1ph \u2243 \u03c12xy \u03c3ph , where \u03c1xy \u2243 eB/ne c is the Hall\nresistivity, affected only weakly by the radiation.\nHere we study the leading inelastic mechanism of MIRO thus taking into account only effects that are\ndue to a non-trivial energy dependence of the non-equlibirum distribution function f (\u03b5). Photoconductivity\n\u03c3ph is given by the dc responce in the state with non-equlibirum f (\u03b5). According to Eq.

(60), inelastic processes are included in the relaxation time approximation\n(which is proven [91] to be sufficient under experimental conditions), and fT (\u03b5) is the Fermi distribution.\nThe left-hand side is due to the electron collisions with impurities in the presence of the external electric\nfields. The first term describes the absorption and emission of microwave quanta; the rate of these transi\u22121\ntions is proportional [61] to \u03c4tr,B\n(\u03b5\u00b1\u03c9) \u221d \u03bd(\u03b5\u00b1\u03c9), see Eqs. (33) and (37). This term can be also extracted\nfrom the kinetic equation of Ref. [88]. The second term describes the effect of the dc field and can be obtained from the first one by taking the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0.

(64); (ii) the amplitude of the oscillations in \u03c7 and \u03c3ph have the same dependence on the\nelectron temperature and microwave power; (iii) the ZRS corresponds to a plateau in the compressibility:\ninside the domains \u03c7 = \u03bd0 (1\u22122\u03b4 2 )/2. Local measurements of the compressibility may provide a real space\nsnapshot of the domain structure in the ZRS. Experimental work in this direction is currently underway.\n7.4 High-power effects, subleading mechanisms, fractional MIRO\nIn addition to the peak-valley structure near integer \u03c9/\u03c9c (integer MIRO), several experiments [83, 85,\n92, 95, 96, 97, 98] reported similar features near certain fractional values, \u03c9/\u03c9c = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 2/3..\n(\"fractional MIRO\", or FMIRO), which at elevated microwave power also evolved into ZRS (\"fractional\nZRS\") [97]. Initially, FMIRO were ascribed to multiphoton processes [95, 99]. This expanation, however,\nfailed to reproduce the observations [98], where the FMIRO only occured at \u03c9 below a certain threshold\nvalue. It was shown that the threshold can be explained in the framework of the single-photon inelastic\nmechanism [98, 100]. Here, the FMIRO near combined resonances n\u03c9 = m\u03c9c occured due to a resonant\nseries of n single-photon transitions with real absorption (emission) of the microwave quanta [100], in\ndistinction to the virtual multiphoton processes. A systematic theory of the FMIRO [101] has shown\nthat the existing theories [99, 100] miss several important contributions. In particular, in the limit of\nwell separated LLs the FMIRO are dominated by multiphoton inelastic mechanism. Provided \u03c4in /\u03c4q \u226b\n1, the multiphoton displacement mechanism [99] yields a parametrically smaller contribution and can\nbe neglected. At weaker magnetic field the effects related to microwave-induced sidebands in the DOS\nbecome important. Close to the magnetic field at which the LLs start to overlap, the FMIRO are dominated\nby the single-photon inelastic mechanism [100]. Finally, in the regime of strongly overlapping LLs the\nFMIRO get exponentially suppressed.\nA unified picture of the photoresponce in the limit of overlapping LLs was recently developed in [102].\nOn top of nonlinear interplay between the inelastic and displacement mechanisms at elevated microwave\npower, two novel mechanisms leading to the MIRO, \"quadrupole\" and \"photovoltaic\", were identified. In\nthe quadrupole mechanism, the microwave radiation leads to excitation of the second angular harmonic\nof the distribution function. The dc response in the resulting nonequilibrium state yields an oscillatory\ncontribution to the Hall part of the photoconductivity tensor which violates Onsager symmetry. In the\nphotovoltaic mechanism, a combined action of the microwave and dc fields produces non-zero temporal\nharmonics of the stationary distribution function. The ac response in this state contributes to both the\nlongitudinal and Hall MIRO. Provided \u03c4in /\u03c4q \u226b 1, the inelastic mechanism still gives the dominant contribution to the diagonal part of the photoconductivity tensor. However, the quadrupole and photovoltaic\nmechanisms are the only ones yielding oscillatory corrections to the Hall part. Further, it was shown that\na competition between various nonlinear effects (the feedback effects, the excitation of high angular and\ntemporal harmonics of the distribution function, and the multiphoton effects) drives the system through\nfour different nonlinear regimes with increasing microwave power. Most dramatic changes in the photoresponse are due to the feedback effects. At P\u03c9 \u226b 1, the feedback from the microwave\u2013induced oscillations\nof the isotropic part of the distribution f (\u03b5) leads to the saturation of the inelastic contribution, and to the\nstrong interplay of the inelastic effect and all other contributions to the MIRO. In particular, the strong oscillations of f (\u03b5) change sign of the most relevant parts of the displacement and photovoltaic contributions.\nAt higher power, P\u03c9 \u226b \u03c9c \u03c4in , the feedback suppresses the effects on higher temporal and angular harmonics of the distribution function. At still higher power, P\u03c9 \u226b \u03c4in /\u03c4q , the multiphoton excitation becomes\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\fpss header will be provided by the publisher\n\n25\n\npronounced and starts to compete with the feedback effects. Finally, at P\u03c9 \u226b \u03c4in /\u03c9c2 \u03c4q3 , the feedback and\nmultiphoton effects destroy all quantum contributions, restoring the classical Drude conductivity.\n7.5 New developments and open questions\nIn spite of the essential advances in the understanding of nonequilibrium magnetotransport phenomena in\na 2DEG, a number of questions remain open. A puzzling insensitivity of the MIRO to the direction of\ncircular polarization of the microwave field was reported in [103]. The strong interplay [104] between\nthe dc\u2013 [105, 106] and microwave\u2013induced oscillations deserves theoretical study. A further challenging\ndirection of future experimental and theoretical research is the transition to the ZRS, the domain structure,\nelectron transport and noise in the ZRS; first steps in this direction have been made in [107, 108]. In\nparticular, the theory has not explained the seemingly activated temperature dependence of the residual\nresistance in the ZRS. Recently discovered B-periodic magnetooscillations [109] which were ascribed to\nthe microwave excitation of 2D edge magnetoplasmons warrant further investigation; in particular, their\nmicroscopic mechanism is still unclear.\nAcknowledgements Most of the work reported in this review has been done in the framework of the Schwerpunktprogramm \"Quanten-Hall-Systeme\" of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
