For BPS black holes in N = 2 theories this phenomenon was first studied in [1] and thereafter discussed in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 9, 10]. It has received further attention recently due to the conjecture of\n[11] and related developments [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For non-supersymmetric\nextremal black holes, some aspects of the attractor phenomenon were discussed in [7] and [8]. More recently this has been investigated in [17] and\n[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. For important related work see [23], [24].\nIn supersymmetric black holes, the central charge, which is a function of\nthe moduli and the charges carried by the black hole, plays an important\nrole in the discussion of the attractor. The attractor values of the scalars,\nwhich are obtained at the horizon of the black hole, are given by minimising\nthe central charge with respect to the moduli. In the non-supersymmetric\ncase one constructs an effective potential which is a function of the moduli\nand charges. The attractor values are then given by minimising this effective\npotential with respect to the moduli.\nThere is a another sense in which the central charge is also minimised at\nthe horizon of a supersymmetric attractor. One finds that the central charge,\nnow regarded as a function of the position coordinate, evolves monotonically\nfrom asymptotic infinity to the horizon and obtains its minimum value at the\nhorizon of the black hole. It is natural to ask whether there is an analogous\nquantity in the non-supersymmetric case and in particular if the effective potential is also monotonic and minimised in this sense for non-supersymmetric\nattractors.\nThis paper addresses this question. We present a c-function for nonsupersymmetric attractors here. We first study the four dimensional case.\nThe c-function has a simple geometrical and physical interpretation in this\ncase. We are interested in spherically symmetric and static configurations\nin which all fields are functions of only one variable - the radial coordinate.\nThe c-function, c(r), is given by\n1\nc(r) = A(r),\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A(r) is the area of the two-sphere, of the SO(3) isometry group orbit,\nas a function of the radial coordinate 1 . For any asymptotically flat solution we show that the area function satisfies a c-theorem and monotonically\ndecreases as one moves inwards from infinity. For a black hole solution, the\n1\n\nWe have set GN = 1.\n\n1\n\n\fstatic region ends at the horizon, so in the static region the c-function attains\nits minimum value at the horizon. This horizon value of the c-function equals\nthe entropy of the black hole. While the horizon value of the c-function is\nalso proportional to the minimum value of the effective potential, more generally, away from the horizon, the two are different. In fact we find that the\neffective potential need not vary monotonically in a non-supersymmetric attractor. The c-theorem we prove is applicable for supersymmetric black holes\nas well. In the supersymmetric case, there are three quantities of interest,\nthe c-function, the effective potential and the square of the central charge.\nAt the horizon these are all equal, up to a constant of proportionality. But\naway from the horizon they are in general different.\nWe work directly with the second order equations of motion in our analysis\nand it might seem puzzling at first that one can prove a c-theorem at all. The\nanswer to the puzzle lies in boundary conditions. For black hole solutions\nwe require that the solutions are asymptotically flat. This is enough to\nensure that going inwards from asymptotic infinity the c-function decreases\nmonotonically. Without imposing any boundary conditions one cannot prove\nthe c-theorem, as one might expect. But one can show that in the absence\nof singularities, c can have at most one critical point.\nWhile non-supersymmetric attractors were our primary motivation, the\nc-theorem is in fact valid for all static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, solutions to the equations of motion 2 . For example, the proof\napplies also to non-extremal black holes. Once again the Area function must\ndecreases monotonically and its minimum value at the horizon is the entropy.\nIn our discussion we focus on a system consisting of 4-dimensional gravity\ncoupled to gauge fields and moduli. But in fact the results are more general.\nThe c-theorem is valid for any matter fields which satisfy the null energy\ncondition. This says that,\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc \u03b6 \u03bd > 0,\n(2)\nfor any null vector \u03b6. As long as this energy condition is met and we have\na static, spherically symmetric solution that is asymptotically flat, the area\nfunction monotonically decreases, moving in from infinity. The importance\nof the null energy condition in the proof of a c-theorem was recognised in\n[25].\nOne can show that the proof of the c-theorem follows in a straightforward\nmanner from the Raychaudhuri equation and the energy condition, eq.(2).\nBy considering a congruence of radially infalling null geodesics one can see\nthat the area A(r) must decrease as one moves inwards from asymptotic\ninfinity. Our focus here is on spherically symmetric configurations, but these\n2\n\nAlso there the spacetime region under consideration must be singularity free.\n\n2\n\n\fcomments suggest that a similar c-theorem can be devised more generally as\nwell.\nIn the latter part of this paper we consider generalisations to higher dimensions. We analyse a system of rank q gauge fields and moduli coupled\nto gravity and once again find a c-function that satisfies a c-theorem. In\nD = p + q + 1 dimensions this system has extremal black brane solutions\nwhose near horizon geometry is AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q . We show that the c-function\nis non-increasing from infinity up to the near horizon region. It's minimum\nvalue in the AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q region agrees with the conformal anomaly in the\ndual boundary theory for p even. A c-function in AdS space was considered\nbefore in [25],[26] and our construction makes important use of the analysis\nand results contained therein.\nIn fact, in the higher dimensional case as well, the c-theorem we prove\nis more general. It applies to all solutions which have a SO(q) \u00d7 P symmetry, where P is the Poincare group in p + 1 dimensions, as long as suitable\nboundary conditions are imposed. Both asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS boundary conditions lead to monotonicity. And both extremal and\nnon-extremal black brane solutions are examples which satisfy the conditions\nfor the c-theorem. Also, the c-theorem works for other kinds of matter we\nwell, as long as the null energy condition holds.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss some background material. Section 3, discusses the c-theorem in 4 dimensions and\nSection 4, the higher dimensional case. Three appendices contain important\ndetails.\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nWe begin with some background related to the discussion of non-supersymmetric\nattractors.\nConsider a theory consisting of four dimensional gravity coupled to U(1)\ngauge fields and moduli, whose bosonic terms have the form,\nZ\n\u221a\n1\na\na\nb \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\nF b \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 12 f \u0303ab (\u03c6i )F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03c1\u03c3\n\u01eb\n).\nS = 2 d4 x \u2212G(R\u22122gij (\u2202\u03c6i )(\u2202\u03c6j )\u2212fab (\u03c6i )F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03ba\n(3)\na\ni\nF\u03bc\u03bd , a = 0, * * * N are gauge fields. \u03c6 , i = 1, * * * n are scalar fields. The scalars\nhave no potential term but determine the gauge coupling constants. We note\nthat gij refers to the metric in the moduli space, this is different from the\nspacetime metric, G\u03bc\u03bd .\n3\n\n\fA spherically symmetric space-time metric in 3 + 1 dimensions takes the\nform,\nds2 = \u2212a(r)2 dt2 + a(r)\u22122 dr 2 + b(r)2 d\u03a92\n\n(4)\n\nThe Bianchi identity and equation of motion for the gauge fields can be\nsolved by a field strength of the form,\n1\nF a = f ab (Qeb \u2212 f \u0303bc Qcm ) 2 dt \u2227 dr + Qam sin\u03b8d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6,\nb\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Qam , Qea are constants that determine the magnetic and electric charges\ncarried by the gauge field F a , and f ab is the inverse of fab .\nThe effective potential Vef f is then given by,\nVef f (\u03c6i ) = f ab (Qea \u2212 f \u0303ac Qcm )(Qeb \u2212 f \u0303bd Qdm ) + fab Qam Qbm .\n\n(6)\n\nFor the attractor mechanism it is sufficient that two conditions to be met.\nFirst, for fixed charges, as a function of the moduli, Vef f must have a critical\npoint. Denoting the critical values for the scalars as \u03c6i = \u03c6i0 we have,\n\u2202i Vef f (\u03c6i0 ) = 0.\n\n(7)\n\nSecond, the effective potential must be a minimum at this critical point. I.e.\nthe matrix of second derivatives of the potential at the critical point,\n1\nMij = \u2202i \u2202j Vef f (\u03c6i0 )\n2\n\n(8)\n\nshould have positive eigenvalues. Schematically we can write,\nMij > 0.\n\n(9)\n\nAs discussed in [21], it is possible that some eigenvalues of Mij vanish. In\nthis case the leading correction to the effective potential along the zero mode\ndirections should be such that the critical point is a minimum. Thus, an\nattractor would result if the leading correction is a quartic term, Vef f =\nVef f (\u03c6i0 ) + \u03bb(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6H )4 , with \u03bb > 0 but not if it is a cubic term, Vef f =\nVef f (\u03c6i0 ) + \u03bb(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6H )3 .\nOnce the two conditions mentioned above are met it was argued in [18]\nthat the attractor mechanism works. There is an extremal Reissner Nordstrom black hole solution in the theory, where the black hole carries the\ncharges specified by the parameters, Qam , Qea and the moduli take the critical values, \u03c60 at infinity. For small enough deviations at infinity of the moduli\n4\n\n\ffrom these values, a double-horizon extremal black hole solution continues to\nexist. In this extremal black hole the scalars take the same fixed values, \u03c60 ,\nat the horizon independent of their values at infinity. The resulting horizon\nradius is given by,\nb2H = Vef f (\u03c6i0 )\n(10)\nand the entropy is\n\n1\nSBH = A = \u03c0b2H .\n4\n\n(11)\n\nIn N = 2 supersymmetric theory, Vef f can be expressed, [7], in terms of\na Kahler potential, K and a superpotential, W as,\nVef f = eK [g ij\u0304 \u2207i W (\u2207j W )\u2217 + |W |2 ],\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u2207i W \u2261 \u2202i W + \u2202i KW . The Kahler potential and Superpotential in\nturn can be expressed in terms of a prepotential F , as,\nK = \u2212 ln Im(\n\nN\nX\n\nX a\u2217 \u2202a F (X)),\n\n(13)\n\na=0\n\nand,\nW = qa X a \u2212 pa \u2202a F,\n\n(14)\n\nrespectively.

We assume that the spacetime in the region of interest\nhas no singularities and the scalar fields lie in a singularity free region of\nmoduli space with a metric which is positive, i.e., all eigenvalues of the moduli\nspace metric, gij , are positive. For a black hole we show that the minimum\nvalue of c, in the static region, equals the entropy at the horizon.\nTo prove monotonicity of c it is enough to prove monotonicity of b. Let\nus define a coordinate y = \u2212r which increases as we move inwards from\nthe asymptotically flat region. We see from eq.(21), since the eigenvalues of\ngij > 0, that d2 b/dy 2 6 0 and so db/dy must be non-increasing as y increases.\nNow for an asymptotically flat solution, at infinity as r \u2192 \u221e, b(r) \u2192 r. This\nmeans db/dy = \u22121. Since db/dy is non-increasing as y increases this means\nthat for all y > \u2212\u221e, db/dy < 0 and thus b is monotonic. This proves the\nc-theorem.\n\n3.2\n\nSome Comments\n\nA few comments are worth making at this stage.\nIt is important to emphasise that our proof of the c-theorem applies to\nany spherically symmetric, static solution which is asymptotically flat. This\nincludes both extremal and non-extremal black holes. The boundary of the\n\u2202\nstatic region of spacetime, where the killing vector \u2202t\nis time-like, is the\nhorizon where a2 \u2192 0. The c function is monotonically decreasing in the\nstatic region, and obtains its minimum value on the boundary at the horizon.\nWe see that this minimum value of c is the entropy of the black hole. We will\ncomment on what happens to c when one goes inside the horizon towards\nthe end of this section.\nFor extremal black holes it is worth noting that the c-function is not Vef f\nitself. At the horizon, where c obtains its minimum value, the two are indeed\nequal (up to a constant of proportionality). This follows from the constraint,\n\u2032\neq.(20), after noting that at a double horizon where a2 and a2 both vanish,\nVef f (\u03c6i0 ) = b2H . But more generally, away from the horizon, c and Vef f are\ndifferent. In particular, we will consider an explicit example in appendix A of\na flow from infinity to the horizon where Vef f does not evolve monotonically.\n7\n\n\fIn the supersymmetric case it is worth commenting that the c-function\ndiscussed above and the square of the central charge agree, up to a proportionality constant, at the horizon of a black hole. But in general, away from\nthe horizon, they are different. For example in a BPS extremal Reissner\nNordstrom black hole, obtained by setting the scalars equal to their attractor values at infinity, the central charge is constant, while the Area is infinite\nasymptotically and monotonically decreases to its minimum at the horizon.\nIt is also worth commenting that c\u2032 can vanish identically only in a\nRobinson-Bertotti spacetime 4 . If c is constant, b is constant. From, eq.(21)\nthen \u03c6i are constant. Thus Vef f is extremised. It follows from the other\nEinstein equations then that a(r) = r/b leading to the Robinson-Bertotti\nspacetime. From this we learn that a flow from one asymptotically (in the\nsense that c\u2032 and all its derivatives vanish) AdS2 \u00d7S 2 where the scalars are at\none critical point of Vef f to an asymptotically AdS2 \u00d7S 2 spacetime where the\nscalars are at another critical point is not possible. Once the scalars begin\nevolving c\u2032 will became negative and cannot return to zero.\nThe c-theorem discussed above is valid more generally than the specific\nsystem consisting of gravity, gauge fields and scalars we have considered here.\nConsider any four-dimensional theory with gravity coupled to matter which\nsatisfies the null energy condition. By this we mean that the stress-energy\nsatisfies the condition,\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc \u03b6 \u03bd > 0,\n(24)\nwhere \u03b6 a is an arbitrary null vector. One can show that in such a system the\nc-theorem is valid for all static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat,\nsolutions of the equations of motion. To see this, note that from the metric\neq.(4), it follows that,\n\u2032\u2032\n\ntt\n\n\u2212 Rtt G + Rrr G\n\nrr\n\n2b\n\n= \u22122a\n\n.\n(25)\nb\nFrom Einstein's equations and the null energy condition we learn that the\nl.h.s above is positive, since\n\u2212 Rtt Gtt + Rrr Grr = T\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc \u03b6 \u03bd > 0\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03b6 \u03bc = (\u03b6 t , \u03b6 r ) are components of a null vector, satisfying the relations,\n(\u03b6 t )2 = \u2212Gtt , (\u03b6 r )2 = Grr . Thus as long as we are outside the horizon, and\na2 > 0, i.e. in any region of space-time where the Killing vector related to\n\u2032\u2032\ntime translations is time-like, b < 0 5 . This is enough to then prove the\n4\n\nBy c\u2032 vanishing identically we mean that c\u2032 and all its derivatives vanish in some region\nof spacetime.\n5\nIn fact the same conclusion also holds inside the horizon. Now t is space-like and r\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\ntime-like and T\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc \u03b6 \u03bd = 2a2 bb > 0. Since a2 < 0, we conclude that b < 0. We will\nreturn to this point at the end of the section.\n\n8\n\n\fmonotonicity of b and thus c. The importance of the null energy condition\nfor a c-theorem was emphasised in [25] 6 .\nIn fact the c-theorem follows simply from the Raychaudhuri equation and\nthe null energy condition. Consider a congruence of null geodesics, where\neach geodesic has (\u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates fixed, with, (t, r), being functions of the\naffine parameter, \u03bb. The expansion parameter of this congruence is\n\u03b8=\n\nd ln A\n,\nd\u03bb\n\n(27)\n\nwhere A is the area, eq.(23). Choosing in going null geodesics for which\ndr/d\u03bb < 0 we see that \u03b8 < 0 at r \u2192 \u221e, for an asymptotically flat space-time.\nd\u03b8\nNow, Raychaudhuri's equation tells us that d\u03bb\n< 0 if the energy condition,\neq.(24), is met. Then it follows that \u03b8 < 0 for all r < \u221e and thus the area\nA must monotonically decrease. The comments in this paragraph provides a\nmore coordinate independent proof of the c-theorem. Although the focus of\nthis paper is time independent, spherically symmetric configurations, these\ncomments also suggest that a similar c-theorem might be valid more generally. The connection between c-theorems and the Raychaudhuri equation\nwas emphasised in [28], [29].\nIn the higher dimensional discussion which follows we will see that the c\nfunction is directly expressed in terms of the expansion parameter \u03b8 for radial\nnull geodesics. The reader might wonder why we have not considered an\nanalogous c function in four-dimensions. From the discussion of the previous\nparagraph we see that any function of the form, 1/\u03b8p , where p is a positive\npower, is monotonically increasing in r. However, in an AdS2 \u00d7S 2 spacetime,\n\u03b8 \u2192 0 and thus such a function will blow up and not equal the entropy of\nthe corresponding extremal black hole.\nIt seems puzzling at first that a c-function could arise from the analysis\nof second order equations of motion. As mentioned in the introduction,\nthe answer to this puzzle lies in the fact that we were considering solutions\nwhich satisfy asymptotically flat boundary conditions. Without imposing\nany boundary conditions, we cannot prove monotonicity of c. But one can\nuse the arguments above to show that there is at most one critical point of\nc as long as the region of spacetime under consideration has no spacetime\nsingularities and also the scalar fields take non-singular values in moduli\nspace. If the critical point occurs at r = r\u2217 , c monotonically decreases for\nall r < r\u2217 and cannot have another critical point. Similarly, for r > r\u2217 .\nFrom the Raychaudhuri equation it follows that the critical point, at r\u2217 , is a\nmaximum.\n6\n\nIn [25] this condition is referred to as the weaker energy condition.\n\n9\n\n\fUsually the discussion of supersymmetric attractors involves the regions\nfrom the horizon to asymptotic infinity. But we can also ask what happens if\nwe go inside the horizon. This is particularly interesting in the non-extremal\ncase where the inside is a time dependent cosmology. In the supersymmetric\ncase one finds that the central charge (and its square) has a minimum at\nthe horizon and increases as one goes away from it towards the outside and\nalso towards the inside. This can be seen as follows. Using continuity at the\nhorizon a modulus take the form in an attractor solution,\n\u03c6(r) \u2212 \u03c60 \u223c |r \u2212 rH |\u03b1\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a positive coefficient and \u03c60 is the attractor value for the modulus\n7\n. Since the central charge is minimised by \u03c60 , one finds by expanding in the\nvicinity of r = rH , that the central charge is also minimised as a function of\nr 8 . In contrast, the c-function we have considered here, monotonically decreases inside the horizon till we reach the singularity. In fact it follows from\nthe Raychaudhuri equation that the expansion parameter \u03b8 monotonically\ndecreases and becomes \u2212\u221e at the singularity.\n\n4\n\nThe c-function In Higher Dimensions\n\nWe analyse higher dimensional generalisations in this section. Consider a system consisting of gravity, gauge fields with rank q field strengths, Fma 1 ***mq , a =\n1, * * * N, and moduli \u03c6i , i = 1, * * * n, in p + q + 1 dimensions, with action,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nD\nb \u03bc\u03bd......\ni\nj\ni 1 a\nS = 2 d x \u2212G R \u2212 2gij (\u2202\u03c6 )\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 fab (\u03c6 ) F\u03bc\u03bd.... F\n. (29)\n\u03ba\nq!\nTake a metric and field strengths of form,\n!\np\u22121\nX\ndyi2 + a(r)\u22122 dr 2 + b(r)2 d\u03a92q ,\nds2 = a(r)2 \u2212dt2 +\n\n(30)\n\ni=1\n\nF a = Qam \u03c9q .\n\n(31)\n\nHere d\u03a92q and \u03c9q are the volume element and volume form of a unit q dimensional sphere sphere. Note that the metric has Poincare invariance in\np direction, t, yi , and has SO(q) rotational symmetry. The field strengths\n7\n\nWe are working in the coordinates, eq.(4). These breakdown at the horizon but are\nvalid for r > rH and also r < rH (where a2 < 0). The solution written here is valid in\nboth these regions; for r = rH we need to take the limiting value.\n8\nThe effective potential Vef f in the non-supersymmetric case is similar. As a function\nof r it attains a local minimum at the horizon.\n\n10\n\n\fthread the q sphere and the configuration carries magnetic charge. Other\ngeneralisations, which we do not discuss here include, forms of different rank,\nand also field strengths carrying both electric and magnetic charge.\nDefine an effective potential,\nVef f = fab (\u03c6i )Qam Qbm .\n\n(32)\n\nNow, as we discuss further in appendix C, it is easy to see that if Vef f has\na critical point where \u2202\u03c6i Vef f vanishes, then by setting the scalars to be at\ntheir critical values, \u03c6i = \u03c6i0 , one has extremal and non extremal black brane\nsolutions in this system with metric, eq.(C.13). For extremal solutions, the\nnear horizon limit is AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q , with metric given by eq.(C.17),\nds2 =\nwhere\n\n\u0001 R2 2\nr2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212dt\n+\ndy\ni + 2 dr + bH d\u03a9q\nR2\nr\nR =\n\n(bH )2(q\u22121) =\n\n\u0012\n\np\nq\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nbH\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\np\nVef f (\u03c6i0 ).\n(p + q \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)\n\n(35)\n\nIn the extremal case, using arguments analogous to [18] one can show that\nthe AdSp+1 \u00d7S q solution is an attractor if the effective potential is minimised\nat the critical point \u03c6i0 . That is, for small deviations from the attractor values\nfor the moduli at infinity, there is an extremal solution in which the moduli\nare drawn to their critical values at the horizon and the geometry in the\nnear-horizon region is AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q .\nWe now turn to discussing the c-function in this system. The discussion\nis motivated by the analysis in [25] of a c-theorem in AdS space. Our claim\nis that a c-function for the system under consideration is given by,\nc = c0\n\n1\n\u00c3(p\u22121)\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nHere, c0 is a constant of proportionality chosen so that c > 0. \u00c3 is defined\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\n\u2032\n\u00c3 = A\n(37)\nq\nb p\u22121\nwhere A is defined to be,\nq\n(38)\nA = ln(ab p\u22121 ),\nand prime denotes derivative with respect to r. We show below that for\nany static, asymptotically flat solution of the form, eq.(30), c, eq.(36), is a\nmonotonic function of the radial coordinate.\n11\n\n\fThe key is once again to use the null energy condition. Consider the\nRtt Gtt \u2212 Rrr Grr component of the Einstein equation. For the metric, eq.(30),\nwe get,\n\u0014\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032 \u0015\na\nb\ntt\nrr\n2\n\u2212 Rtt G + Rrr G = a \u2212(p \u2212 1) \u2212 q\n= T\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc \u03b6 \u03bd ,\n(39)\na\nb\nwhere (\u03b6 t, \u03b6 r ) are the components of a null vector which satisfy the relation,\n(\u03b6 t )2 = \u2212Gtt , (\u03b6 r )2 = Grr . The null energy condition tells us that the r.h.s\ncannot be negative. For the system under consideration the r.h.s can be\ncalculated giving,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\na\nb\n\u2212 (p \u2212 1) \u2212 q = 2gij \u2202r \u03c6i \u2202r \u03c6j .\na\nb\n\n(40)\n\nIt is indeed positive, as would be expected since the matter fields we include\nsatisfy the null energy condition.\nFrom eq.(40) we find that\na\nd\u00c3\n=\u2212 q\ndr\nb p\u22121\nand thus,\n\nd\u00c3\ndr\n\n\u0014\n\n!\u0012 \u0013 #\n\u0012\n2\n2\n2\nq\nq\nb\u2032\n,\ngij \u03c6i \u03c6j +\n+\np\u22121\np \u2212 1 (p \u2212 1)2\nb\n\n(41)\n\n6 0.\n\nNow we turn to the monotonicity of c. Consider a solution which becomes\nasymptotically flat as r \u2192 \u221e. Then, a \u2192 1, b \u2192 r, as r \u2192 \u221e. It follows\nthen that \u00c3 \u2192 0+ asymptotically. Since, we learn from eq.(41) that \u00c3 is a\nnon-increasing function of r it then follows that for all r < \u221e, \u00c3 > 0. Since,\na, b > 0, we then also learn from, eq.(37), that A\u2032 > 0 for all finite r.\nNext choose a coordinate y = \u2212r which increases as we go in from asymptotic infinity. We have just learned that dA/dy = \u2212A\u2032 < 0, for finite r. It is\nnow easy to see that\na dA 1 d\u00c3\ndc\n= \u2212(p \u2212 1) q c\n.\ndy\nb p\u22121 dy \u00c32 dr\n\n(42)\n\nThen given that a, b > 0, c > 0, and dA/dy < 0, ddr\u00c3 6 0, it follows that\ndc/dy 6 0, so that the c-function is a non-increasing function along the\ndirection of increasing y. This completes our proof of the c-theorem.\nFor a black brane solution the static region of spacetime ends at a horizon, where a2 vanishes. The c-function monotonically decreases from infinity\nand in the static region obtains its minimum value at the horizon. For the\nextremal black brane the near horizon geometry is AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q . We now\n12\n\n\fverify that for p even the c function evaluated in the AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q geometry\nagrees with the conformal anomaly in the boundary Conformal Field Theory.\nFrom eq.(33) we see that in AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q ,\na\u2032 = 1/R\nq\u22121\nR.\nb =\np\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the AdSp+1. Then\nc\u221d\n\nRp+q\u22121\nRp\u22121\n\u221d\nGp+q+1\nGp+1\nN\nN\n\n(45)\n\nwhere Gp+q+1\n, Gp+1\nrefer to Newton's constant in the p + q + 1 dimensional\nN\nN\nspacetime and the p + 1 dimensional spacetime obtained after KK reduction\non the S q respectively. The right hand side in eq.(45) is indeed proportional\nto the value of the conformal anomaly in the boundary theory when p is\neven [30]. By choosing c0 , eq.(36), appropriately, they can be made equal.\nLet us also comment that c in the near horizon region can be expressed\nin terms of the minimum value of the effective potential. One finds that\n(p+q\u22121)\nc \u221d (Vef f (\u03c6i0 )) 2(q\u22121) , where the critical values for the moduli are \u03c6i = \u03c6i0 .\nA few comments are worth making at this stage. We have only considered\nasymptotically flat spacetimes here. But our proof of the c-theorem holds\nfor other cases as well. Of particular interest are asymptotically AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q\nspacetime. The metric in this case takes the form, eq.(33), as r \u2192 \u221e. The\nproof is very similar to the asymptotically flat case. Once again one can\nargue that A\u2032 > 0 for r < \u221e and then defining a coordinate y = \u2212r it\nfollows that dc/dy is a non-increasing function of y. The c-theorem allows\nfor flows which terminate in another asymptotic AdSp+1 \u00d7S q spacetime. The\nsecond AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q space-time, which lies at larger y, must have smaller c.\nSuch flows can arise if Vef f has more than one critical point. It is also worth\ncommenting that requiring that c is a constant in some region of spacetime\nleads to the unique solution (subject to the conditions of a metric which\nsatisfies the ansatz, eq.(30)) of AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q with the scalars being constant\nand equal to a critical value of Vef f .\nWe mentioned above that our definition of the c function is motivated\nby [25]. Let us make the connection clearer. The c-function in9 [25],[26] is\ndefined for a spacetime of the form,\nX\nds2 = e2A\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dy \u03bcdy \u03bd + dz 2 ,\n(46)\n\u03bc,\u03bd=0,***p\n\n9\n\nAnother c-function has been defined in [27].\n\n13\n\n\fand is given by\nc=\n\nc0\n.\n(dA/dz)p\u22121\n\n(47)\n\nNote that eq.(46) is the Einstein frame metric in p + 1 dimensions. Starting with the metric, eq.(30), and Kaluza-Klein reducing over the Q sphere\nshows that A defined in eq.(38) agrees with the definition eq.(46) above and\ndA/dz agrees with \u00c3 in eq.(37). This shows that the c-function eq.(36) and\neq.(47)are the same.\nThe monotonicity of c follows from that of \u00c3, eq.(37). One can show\nthat for a congruence of null geodesics moving in the radial direction, with\nconstant (\u03b8, \u03c6), the expansion parameter \u03b8 is given by,\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\na\nq b\u2032\n\u03b8=\n.\n(48)\n+\na\np\u22121 b\nRaychaudhuri's equation and the null energy condition then tells us that\nd\u03b8\n< 0. However, in an AdSp+1 \u00d7 S q spacetime \u03b8 diverges, this behaviour\ndr\nis not appropriate for a c-function. From eq.(37) we see that \u00c3 differs from\nq\n\u03b8 by an additional multiplicative factor, a/b p\u22121 . This factor is chosen to\npreserve monotonicity and now ensures that c goes to a finite constant in\nAdSp+1 \u00d7 S q spacetimes. A similar comment also applies to the c-function\ndiscussed in [25].\n\n5\n\nConcluding Comments\n\nIn two-dimensional field theories it has been suggested sometime ago [31, 32,\n33] that the c function plays the role of a potential, so that the RG equations\ntake the form of a gradient flow,\n\u03b2i = \u2212\n\n\u2202c\n,\n\u2202g i\n\nwhere c is the Zamolodchikov c-function [34]. This phenomenon has a close\nanalogy in the case of supersymmetric black holes, where the radial evolution of the moduli is determined by the gradient of the central charge in a\nfirst order equation. In contrast, the c-function we propose does not satisfy\nthis property in either the supersymmetric or the non-supersymmetric case.\nIn particular, in the non-supersymmetric case the scalar fields satisfy a second order equation and in particular the gradient of the c-function does not\ndirectly determine their radial evolution.\nIt might seem confusing at first that our derivation of the c-theorem\nfollowed from the second order equations of motion. The following simple\n14\n\n\fmechanically model is useful in understanding this. Consider a particle moving under the force of gravity. The c-function in this case is the height x\nwhich satisfies the condition\n\u1e8d = \u2212g,\n(49)\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity. Now, if the initial conditions are\nsuch that \u1e8b < 0 then going forwards in time x will monotonically decrease.\nHowever, if the direction of time is chosen so that \u1e8b > 0, going forward in\ntime there will be a critical point for x and thus x will not be a monotonic\nfunction of time. In this case though there can be at most one such critical\npoint.\n\nWhile the equations of motion that govern radial evolution are second order, the attractor boundary conditions restrict the allowed initial conditions\nand in effect make the equations first order. This suggests a close analogy\nbetween radial evolution and RG flow. The existence of a c-function which\nwe have discussed in this paper adds additional weight to the analogy. In the\nnear-horizon region, where the geometry is AdSp+1 \u00d7S q , the relation between\nradial evolution and RG flow is quite precise and well known. The attractor behaviour in the near horizon region can be viewed from the dual CFT\nperspective. It corresponds to turning on operators which are irrelevant in\nthe infra-red. These operators are dual to the moduli fields in the bulk, and\ntheir being irrelevant in the IR follows from the fact that the mass matrix,\neq.(8), has only positive eigenvalues.\nIt is also worth commenting that the attractor phenomenon in the context of black holes is quite different from the usual attractor phenomenon in\ndynamical systems. In the latter case the attractor phenomenon refers to the\nfact that there is a universal solution that governs the long time behaviour\nof the system, regardless of initial conditions. In the black hole context a\ngeneric choice of initial conditions at asymptotic infinity does not lead to\nthe attractor phenomenon. Rather there is one well behaved mode near the\nhorizon and choosing an appropriate combination of the two solutions to the\nsecond order equations at infinity allows us to match on to this well behaved\nsolution at the horizon. Choosing generic initial conditions at infinity would\nalso lead to triggering the second mode near the horizon which is ill behaved\nand typically would lead to a singularity.\nFinally, we end with some comments about attractors in cosmology.\nScalar fields exhibit a late time attractor behaviour in FRW cosmologies\nwith growing scale factor (positive Hubble constant H). Hubble expansion\nleads to a friction term in the scalar field equations,\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + \u2202\u03c6 V = 0.\n\n(50)\n\nAs a result at late times the scalar fields tend to settle down at the minimum\n15\n\n\fof the potential generically without any precise tuning of initial conditions.\nThis is quite different from the attractor behaviour for black holes and more\nakin to the attractor in dynamical systems mentioned above.\nActually in AdS space there is an analogy to the cosmological attractor.\nTake a scalar field which has a negative (mass)2 in AdS space (above the BF\nbound). This field is dual to a relevant operator. Going to the boundary of\nAdS space a perturbation in such a field will generically die away. This is the\nanalogue of the late time behaviour in cosmology mentioned above. Similarly\nthere is an analogue to the black hole attractor in cosmology. Consider dS\nspace in Poincare coordinates,\nds2 = \u2212\n\ndt2\n+ t2 dx2i ,\nt2\n\n(51)\n\nand a scalar field with potential V propagating in this background. Notice\nthat t \u2192 0 is a double horizon. For the scalar field to be well behaved at\nthe horizon, as t \u2192 0, it must go to a critical point of V , and moreover this\ncritical point will be stable in the sense that small perturbations of the scalar\nabout the critical point will bring it back, if V \u2032\u2032 < 0 at the critical point, i.e.,\nif the critical point is a maximum. This is the analogue of requiring that Vef f\nis at a minimum for attractor behaviour in black hole 10 . It is amusing to\nnote that a cosmology in which scalars are at the maximum of their potential,\nearly on in the history of the universe, could have other virtues as well in the\ncontext of inflation.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank N.

The basic point\nin our example is simple. The scalar field \u03c6 is a monotonic function of the\nradial coordinate, r, eq.(4) . But the effective potential is not a monotonic\nfunction of \u03c6, and as a result is not monotonic in r.\n10\n\nThe sign reversal is due to the interchange of a space and time directions.\n\n16\n\n\fV\n02\n\nVeff ( \u03c6 )\n\nV\n01\n\n\u03c6\n\n01\n\n\u03c6\n\na\n\n\u03c6\n\n02\n\n\u03c6\n\nFigure 1: The effective potential Vef f as a function of \u03c6\nWe work with the following simple Vef f to construct such a solution,\n1\nVef f = V01 + m2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c601 )2 , \u03c6 6 \u03c6a\n2\n1\nVef f = V02 \u2212 m2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c602 )2 , \u03c6 > \u03c6a .\n2\nAt \u03c6a , the potential is continuous, giving the relation,\n1\n1\nV02 = V01 + m2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c601 )2 + m2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c602 )2 .\n2\n2\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\n(A.3)\n\nWe will take the potential as being specified by V01 , \u03c601 , \u03c602 , \u03c6a , m2 with V02\nbeing determined by eq.(A.3). The effective potential is given in fig. 1. Note\nthat with a minimum at \u03c601 and a maximum at \u03c602 , Vef f , is a non-monotonic\nfunction of \u03c6. Note also that the the first derivative of the potential has a\nfinite jump at \u03c6 = \u03c6a . Since the equations of motion are second order\nthis means the scalar fields and the metric components, a, b, and their first\nderivatives will be continuous across \u03c6a . The finite jump is thus mild enough\nfor our purposes.\nThe attractor value for the scalar is \u03c601 . By setting \u03c6 = \u03c601 , independent\nof r, we get an extremal Reissner Nordstrom black hole solution. The radius\nof the horizon, rH in this solution is given by\n2\nrH\n= V01 .\n\n(A.4)\n17\n\n\fThis solution is our starting point. We now construct the solution of interest\nin perturbation theory, following the analysis in [18], whose conventions we\nalso adopt. For the validity of perturbation theory, we take, \u03c6a \u2212 \u03c601 \u226a 1,\nand also \u03c602 \u2212 \u03c601 \u226a 1. The non-monotonicity of the potential then comes\ninto play even when the scalar field makes only small excursions around the\n2\n< 1, it then follows that\nminimum \u03c601 . In addition we will also take, 4m\nr2\nV02 \u2212V01\nV01\n\nH\n\n\u226a 1.\n\nWe construct the solution for the scalar field to first order in perturbation\ntheory below. In the solution the scalar field is a monotonic function of\nr. This allows the solution to be described in two regions. In region I,\n\u03c601 6 \u03c6 6 \u03c6a , it is given by,\n\u03c6 = \u03c601 + A(r \u2212 rH )\u03b1 ,\ns\n!\n4m2\n1\n1+ 2 \u22121 .\n\u03b1 =\n2\nrH\n\n(A.5)\n(A.6)\n\nAnd in region II, \u03c6 > \u03c6a , it is given by,\n\u03c6 = \u03c602 + B1 (r \u2212 rH )(\u2212\u03b31 ) + B2 (r \u2212 rH )(\u2212\u03b32 ) ,\ns\n!\n4m2\n1\n1+ 1\u2212 2\n,\n\u03b31 =\n2\nrH\ns\n!\n4m2\n1\n1\u2212 1\u2212 2\n.\n\u03b32 =\n2\nrH\n\n(A.7)\n(A.8)\n(A.9)\n\nThe boundary between the two is at ra , where \u03c6 = \u03c6a , and \u03c6 and its first\nderivative with respect to r are continuous. The continuity conditions allow\nus to solve for B1 , B2 , in terms of A, and also determine ra in terms of A.\nThe solution is thus completely specified by the constant, A. ra satisfies the\nrelation,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b1\nrh\n(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c601 )\n1\u2212\n.\n(A.10)\n=\nra\nA\nWe will omit some details of the subsequent analysis. One finds that as\nlong as\n\u03b1\n\u0012 \u0013 \u03b3 \u2212\u03b3\n\u03b31 1 2\n(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c601 ),\n(A.11)\n(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c601 ) < A <\n\u03b32\n\nthe scalar field monotonically evolves with r and transits from region I to\nregion II as r increases. Now we see from eq.(A.7) that if B1 + B2 > 0,\n\u03c6(r \u2192 \u221e) > \u03c602 . This ensures that Vef f is not a monotonic function of r.\nIt will first increases and then decreases as r decreases from \u221e to rH . The\n18\n\n\fcondition, B1 + B2 > 0, gives rise to the condition,\n(\u03c602 \u2212 \u03c6a ) < \u03b1\n\nrH \u03b31 \u2212\u03b32\n)\n]\nra\nrH \u03b31 \u2212\u03b32 (\u03c6a\n]\n\u2212 ra )\n\n[1 \u2212 (1 \u2212\n\n[\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32 (1\n\n\u2212 \u03c601 ).\n\n(A.12)\n\nHaving picked a value of A that lies in the range, eq.(A.11), we can then\ndetermine ra from eq.(A.10). As long as \u03c602 is small enough and satisfies\ncondition eq.(A.12) we see that the asymptotic value of \u03c6(r \u2192 \u221e) > \u03c602 .\nIt then follows, as argued above, that in the resulting solution Vef f is not a\nmonotonic function of r.\nWe end with three comments. First, we have not obtained the the corrections to the metric components a, b in perturbation theory here. But this\ncan be done following the analysis in [18]. One finds that the corrections\nare small. Second, the c-function is of course monotonic as a function of\nthe radial coordinate in this example too. The area of the extremal Reissner Nordstrom black hole monotonically decreases and this is true even after\nincluding the small corrections in perturbation theory. Finally, we have not\nobtained the effective potential above starting with gauge fields coupled to\nmoduli. In fact, for dilaton-like couplings, the simplest example we have been\nable to construct, where Vef f has multicritical points with some minimal and\nmaxima, involves two moduli, a dilaton and axion, and two gauge fields. Our\ndiscussion above has a close parallel in this case as well (with both dilaton\nand axion excited) and we expect, by dialling the charges and couplings, that\nthe analogue of condition eq.(A.12) can be met leading to solutions where\nVef f evolves non-monotonically with the radial coordinate r.\n\nB\n\nMore Details in Higher Dimensional Case\n\nThe equations of motion that follow from the action, eq.(29), are,\nq\u22121\na\na\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\u2202\u03bc \u03c6i \u2202\u03bd \u03c6i\n= q!q fab (\u03c6i )F\u03bc\u03bb....\nF\u03bdb\u03bb..... \u2212 (p+q\u22121)q!\nG\u03bc\u03bd fab (\u03c6i )F\u03bc\u03bd....\nFb\n\u221a\n1\na\n\u221a 1 \u2202\u03bc ( \u2212G\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6i )\n\u2202i fab (\u03c6i )F\u03bc\u03bd....\nF b \u03bc\u03bd......\n= 4q!\n\u2212G\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc ( \u2212Gfab (\u03c6i )F b\u03bc\u03bd ) = 0.\n(B.1)\n2\n\n\u03bc\u03bd......\n\nSubstituting for the gauge fields from eq.(31) we learn that Rtt = ab2 ( q\u22121\n)R\u03b8\u03b8 ,\np\nwhich yields the equation,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\nqaa b\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u20322\n2\n+ aa = (q\u22121) (q \u2212 1) \u2212 (p + 1)aba b \u2212 a2 (q \u2212 1)b 2 + bb\npb pa +\nb\n(B.2)\n19\n\n\fwhere we have computed the curvature components using the metric, eq.(30).\ntt\nThe Rrr \u2212 GGrr Rtt component of the Einstein equation gives\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\na\nqb\n(p \u2212 1) +\n= \u22122gij \u2202r \u03c6i \u2202r \u03c6j .\na\nb\n\n(B.3)\n\nAlso the Rrr component itself yields a first order \"energy\" constraint,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(p(p\u22121)b2 a 2 +2pqaba b +q(q\u22121)(\u22121+a2 b 2 )) = 2a2 b2 gij \u2202r \u03c6i \u2202r \u03c6j \u2212Vef f (\u03c6i )b\u22122(q\u22121)\n(B.4)\nwhere Vef f is defined in eq.(32).\nThe equation of motion of the scalar field is given by,\n\u2202r (ap+1 bq \u2202r gij \u03c6j ) =\n\nap\u22121 \u2202i Vef f\n.\n4bq\n\n(B.5)\n\nSetting \u03c6i = \u03c6i0 , where \u03c6i0 is a critical point of Vef f one finds that AdSp+1 \u00d7\nS is a solution of these equations with metric, eq.(33).\nq\n\nC\n\nHigher Dimensional p-Brane Solutions\n\nFixing the scalars at their attractor values, as described in section 4, we are\nleft with the action\n(\n)\nZ\nX\n\u221a\n1\n1\nFa 2\nS = 2 dD x \u2212G R \u2212\n(C.1)\n\u03ba\nq! a (q)\nwhere fab has been diagonalised and the attractor values of the scalars have\nbeen absorbed into the a redefinition of the gauge charges, Qa .
