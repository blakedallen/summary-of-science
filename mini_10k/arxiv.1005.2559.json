Most of the advances in new technologies and devices for quantum computing implementation\nbased in solid state or atomic and optical systems made use\nof this model. Many tasks in quantum computing demand coherent superpositions and/or entanglement. These two intrinsically quantum ingredients are thus fundamental to disclose the\nquantum content of information. There has been a great effort\nto successfully and faithfully implement quantum computing\nbuilding blocks in large scales. The simplest block is an information carrier capable of being in general superposition of\ntwo orthogonal states, also known as qubit [2]. Another fundamental block is the ability to perform general quantum state\nmanipulations and measurements on these qubits [2].\nThe increasing degree of control that has been achieved in\nthe level of single quantum systems has confirmed the predictions of fundamental models like the JCM and some of its generalizations [3]. The inclusion of a second radiation mode (bimodal cavities) is expected to bring out different quantum effects [4\u20137]. Such effects may concern quantum statistical properties of the fields, and also the dynamics with applications in\nthe controlled generation of entanglement. The interaction of\ntwo-level atoms with two modes sustained by two weakly coupled cavities separated by a thin dielectric barrier is considered\nin [8], where the authors propose a generation scheme of atomatom maximally entangled states. From the experimental side,\nthe preparation of two modes of a superconducting cavity in a\nmaximally entangled state has already been achieved [9]. Following this experimental achievement, generation schemes of\nimportant multipartite entangled states such as GHZ, W and\ncluster states [10, 11] have been suggested. In general, such\nschemes make use of a sudden change of the atomic transition frequency in order to induce resonant interaction with one\nmode or the other. This might introduce imperfections [12]\nthat should be considered for the best agreement with the experiment.\nIn this paper, we study the dynamics of two non-degenerate\nbosonic modes interacting with N identical two-level systems\n(qubits), aiming at the generation of important multipartite entangled states between the modes, qubits or modes and qubits\n\n\u2217\n\nDOI: 10.1140/epjd/e2010-00188-2 (The final publication is available at\nwww.epj.org)\n\n(hybrid). An important feature of our proposal is that it does\nnot make use of sudden frequency changes. By fixing the qubit\nfrequency separation to be midway the natural frequencies of\nthe modes [8], and by properly choosing the phases of the coupling constants, our schemes avoid the undesired effects introduced by suddenly switching the frequencies. Besides the\ngeneration of Bell, W and GHZ states, we also describe a\none-step generation scheme of the linear cluster state among\nfour qubits [13]. When comparing, for example, with cavity\nQED schemes, it does not make use of either rotation of qubits\n(Ramsey zones) or classical external fields, usual requirements\nin most schemes for entanglement generation in these setups\n[14, 15]. It is remarkable that the effective model obtained\nhere (XY model) allows the generation of such a state, complementing the usual approach which employs the Ising model\n[13]. It is important to emphasize that all protocols for the\ngeneration of multipartite entangled states presented here are\ndeterministic, i.e. no measurements are performed at all.\nWe organize the paper as follows. In Section II, we describe\nthe model and its dynamics in the case of approximate resonance of the qubits with the bosonic modes considering: (i)\nnot simultaneous interaction of qubits and modes, and (ii) simultaneous interaction of qubits and modes. We then discuss\nthe generation of Bell and W states. In Section III, we derive\nthe effective Hamiltonian of the qubits simultaneously interacting with the modes in the case of far off resonance, and we\npropose the generation of Bell, W, GHZ and cluster states in\nthis configuration. In Section IV, we consider common experimental imperfections such as amplitude damping and finite\ntime-control precision, analyzing the fidelity in the generation\nschemes and the violation of local realism for the cluster state.\nIn Section V, we present physical setups where our ideas may\nbe implemented. We summarize and conclude in Section VI.\nThe ideas in this paper will be put in the general language of\ntwo-level systems (qubits) and bosonic modes. Consequently,\nthe results presented here may be of interest for application in\nany particular quantum system described by JCM interactions.\nThis includes circuit-QED systems [16] and trapped ions [17],\njust to name a few.\n\nII.\n\nGENERATION OF W STATES WITH BIMODAL JCM\nINTERACTIONS\n\nIn cavity-QED, phase differences between coupling constants of atoms and field modes are in general considered\nunimportant in many situations. However, special choices of\nthese phases have been shown to avoid the destruction of mi-\n\n\f2\ncroscopic correlations between the modes, important for the\nappearance of decoherence-free subspaces and robust states\n[18, 19]. Besides, it can not be underrated that these phases\nare of key importance for a plethora of quantum interference\neffects, responsible for many quantum phenomena [20]. In the\ncontext of trapped ions, adjustments of intensity and phase of\nthe couplings constants have also been proved to be fundamental to the generation of cluster states when the ions are driven\nby red- and blue-sideband laser fields [21].\nIn order to explore such possibilities, we study a general\nsystem composed of N two-level systems or qubits interacting\nwith two bosonic modes. In the rotating wave approximation,\nthe Hamiltonian for the two modes and qubit k (k = 1 . . . N ),\nin the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, reads (~ = 1)\n\u03c9 z\n(A)\n\u03c3 + \u03a9k (a\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 + a\u03c3k+ )\n2 k\n(B)\n+\u03a9k (b\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 + b\u03c3k+ ),\n(1)\n\nHk = \u03c9 A a \u2020 a + \u03c9 B b\u2020 b +\n\nwhere \u03c9A (\u03c9B ) is the frequency of mode A (B), a and b (a\u2020 and\nb\u2020 ) are the photon annihilation (creation) operators of modes\nA and B, \u03c9 is the qubit frequency and \u03c3ki (i = x, y, z), with\n\u03c3k\u00b1 = (1/2)(\u03c3kx \u00b1 i\u03c3ky ), refer to the Pauli operators of qubit k.\nHere we consider the qubit coupling with mode A to be real,\n(A)\npositive, and constant i.e. \u03a9k = \u03a9 for all k, while the qubit\n(B)\ncoupling with mode B may also be negative, i.e. \u03a9k = \u03a9sk ,\nwhere sk = \u00b11.\nWe move to a frame rotating according to e\u2212iGt , with\nG = \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c9b\u2020 b +\n\n\u03c9 z\n\u03c3 ,\n2 k\n\n(2)\n\nH\u0303k = \u2206a\u2020 a \u2212 \u2206b\u2020 b + \u03a9(a\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 + a\u03c3k+ ) + \u03a9sk (b\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 + b\u03c3k+ ),\n(3)\nwhere we have set the qubit frequency midway the modes\nfrequencies separation, i.e. the detuning is given by \u2206 =\n\u03c9A \u2212 \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9B , with \u03c9A > \u03c9B .\nA. One qubit per time\n\nIn cavity-QED, this situation is precisely the one where twolevel atoms are sent one by one through a bimodal cavity in\nsuch a way that only one atom is found inside the cavity per\ntime. We then let the first qubit interact with the modes. If\nthe system state at t = 0 is |0A i|0B i|\u21911 i \u2261 |00\u2191i, where\nthe modes are in the vacuum state and the qubit 1 is in the\nspin up state1 , we may restrict the space state to the subspace\nspanned by the basis {|10\u2193i, |01\u2193i, |00\u2191i}. After the interaction of qubit 1 with the modes (time t), the system state will be\ngiven by\n\n1\n\n\u03a9\n[\u2206(1 \u2212 cos \u03a9\u0303t) + i\u03a9\u0303 sin \u03a9\u0303t],\n(5)\n\u03a9\u03032\nc2 (t) = \u2212s1 c\u22171 (t),\n(6)\n1\n(\u22062 + 2\u03a92 cos \u03a9\u0303t),\n(7)\nc3 (t) =\n\u03a9\u03032\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a9\u0303 = \u22062 + 2\u03a92 is the Rabi frequency. The probability\nof finding this qubit in the spin up state is\nc1 (t) = \u2212\n\nP\u21911 (t) = |c3 (t)|2 =\n\n1\n(\u22062 + 2\u03a92 cos \u03a9\u0303t)2 .\n\u03a9\u03034\n\n(4)\n\nWe borrowed the usual notation of spin\u22121/2 particles when referring to the\nstates of the qubits.\n\n(8)\n\nThis quantity plays an important role in the generation protocols described in this section. We may use (8) to obtain the\nshortest time needed to achieve a desired value of P\u21911\np\n\u03a9\u03032 P\u21911 \u2212 \u22062\n1\nt = arccos\n,\n(9)\n2\u03a92\n\u03a9\u0303\nfrom where we can see that\nq\np\n1 + P\u2191 1\n\u2206 \u221a\n0\u2264\n\u2264 2q\n,\np\n\u03a9\n1\u2212 P\n\n(10)\n\n\u21911\n\nbecause the domain of the arccos function is finite. Thus, the\nqubit 1 may transfer its whole excitation\u221aenergy to the field\nmodes (P\u21911 = 0) whenever 0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 2\u03a9, in accordance\nwith [8]. In this case, since |c1 (t)|2 = |c2 (t)|2 , the nondegenerate modes will end up in the Bell state\n1\n|\u03a8+ i = \u221a (|10i + |01i),\n2\n\nso that the Hamiltonian in this frame is given by\n\n|\u03c8(t)i = c1 (t)|10\u2193i + c2 (t)|01\u2193i + c3 (t)|00\u2191i,\n\nwith coefficients\n\n(11)\n\nup to local unitary (l.u.) operations. It is important to remark\nthat no measurements were needed here because the qubit disentangles with the modes after such t. In the cavity-QED language, for instance, in order to generate this state for two field\nmodes, previous schemes [22, 23] generally made use of either\ntwo cavities (making the experimental control and costs more\ndemanding) or a sudden change of the atomic frequency also in\na bimodal setup (which can introduce errors and decrease the\nfidelity of the generation protocol). However, if one is interested in entangling distant cavities for teleportation purposes\n[24], a two cavity setup is of course more appropriate than a\nsingle bimodal cavity.\nConversely, if the first qubit ends up with P\u21911 > 0, it will\nbe entangled with the modes. For instance, consider the case\nin which P\u21911 = 1/3. This may be achieved by choosing 0 \u2264\n\u221a\n\u2206 \u2264 (1 + 3)\u03a9 and adjusting t through (9). In this case, the\nsystem will end up in the state (l.u.)\n1\n|W3 i = \u221a (|10\u2193i + |01\u2193i + |00\u2191i),\n3\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is a hybrid W state among these three subsystems.\nAnother example is the choice P\u21911 = 1/2, which demands\n\u221a\n0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 (2 + 2)\u03a9. Again, by adjusting t with the help of\n(9), a hybrid entangled state (l.u.)\n|WT i =\n\n\u221a\n1\n(|10\u2193i + |01\u2193i + 2|00\u2191i),\n2\n\n(13)\n\n\f3\nis generated. This is a special instance of a generalized W state,\nand it finds application in quantum teleportation [25].\nIn what concerns the generation of entangled states, the role\nof the sign of coupling constant seems to be irrelevant for the\none qubit setup. However, when a second qubit subsequently\ninteracts with the modes, the choice of different constant coupling phases will lead to substantially different dynamics. For\ncompleteness, we will also consider a delay time td during\nwhich the subsystems follow free evolution [8]. If the interaction of qubit 1 with the modes takes a time t1 , and the interaction of qubit 2 (initially prepared in the spin down state\n|\u2193i) with the modes takes a time t2 , the final global state can\nbe written as\n|\u03c8(t1 , td , t2 )i = \u03b1(t1 , td , t2 )|10\u2193\u2193i + \u03b2(t1 , td , t2 )|01\u2193\u2193i\n+\u03b3(t1 )|00\u2191\u2193i + \u03b4(t1 , td , t2 )|00\u2193\u2191i, (14)\nwhere we point out the independence of \u03b3(t1 ) \u2261 c3 (t1 ) on\nsubsequent times.

The possibility of eliminating the delay time through careful choices of\nthe phases of the coupling constants may be useful for diminishing decoherence damage (reducing overall time). This is a\nquantum interference effect.\nThe pursuit of generation of W states involving more qubits\nin this scenario may not be useful since the number of steps\nin this generation scheme grows with the number of qubits,\nand decoherence is expected to decrease the state fidelity if\nmany steps are required. This motivates the search for schemes\nin which the generation of N -qubit entangled states does not\nscale with N . The rest of the paper is dedicated to such\nschemes. Indeed, it turns out that the next scheme does not\nscale with N (one step generation), and the time taken to complete the protocol decreases with N .\n\nN\n\u03c9X z\n\u03c3k ,\n2\nk=1\n\n2\u03a92\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03a9\u0303N t),\n\u03a9\u03032N\n\n(24)\n\n(1)\n\n(t) = cN (t) \u2212 1,\n(25)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a9\u0303N = \u22062 + 2N \u03a92 . Of course, for N = 1 we recover\nthe results of previous analysis (observe that the last equation\nabove does not apply in this case). For N > 1, it follows from\nthe last two equations that\nq\n(N )\n\u03a9\u03032N ( P\u21911 \u2212 1) + 2\u03a92\n1\nt=\narccos\n2\u03a92\n\u03a9\u0303N\nq\n(N )\n\u03a9\u03032N P\u2191k + 2\u03a92\n1\n,\n(26)\narccos\n=\n2\u03a92\n\u03a9\u0303N\ncN\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nk=1\n\na(t2 ) =\n\nWe now provide a link between the sign of the coupling constants and the delay time. We will show that the choice of the\nrelative sign of coupling constants may be chosen to mimic the\ndelay time under special conditions. In order to see that, one\nhas to realize that the probability of finding the qubit 2 in the\nspin up state P\u21912 (t1 , td , t2 ) = |\u03b4(t1 , td , t2 )|2 can be written,\nfor the choice td = j\u03c0/(2\u2206) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . .), as\n\nk=1\n\n(N )\n\nis the shortest time needed to achieve a given probability P\u21911(k)\nof finding qubit 1 (k 6= 1) in the spin up state. Also, from the\narguments of the arccos functions above, these two probabilities are related by\nq\nq\n(N )\n(N )\nP\u21911 \u2212 1 = P\u2191k .\n(27)\n\n\f4\nAs we are interested in the generation of hybrid (prototype)\n(N )\n(N )\nWN +2 (WN ) states, we must impose P\u21911 = P\u2191k = 1/(N +\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n2) (P\u21911 = P\u2191k = 1/N ) which is only fulfilled for N = 2\n(N = 4), see (27). Thus, for N > 1, this initial preparation only allows for the generation of hybrid or prototype W\nstates involving either two modes and two qubits or four qubits\n(modes factoring out). Such a limitation may also be observed\nin similar situations where only one excitation is present in the\nsystem [28, 29]. Here, the hybrid (prototype) W4 state may be\ngenerated for a detuning satisfying 0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 2\u03a9 (\u2206 = 0).\nThe limitation on N for generation of hybrid (prototype) W\nstates may be avoided if we follow a prior step: we let an\nauxiliary spin up qubit (frequency \u03c90 ) interact with the modes\n(initially in vacuum states) transferring its whole energy to the\nmodes [(9) and (10) with P\u21910 (t) = 0]. This is the exact protocol described in the last section. Conveniently parameterizing\nthe resulting modes state as |\u03c8c i = p|10i \u2212 s0 p\u2217 |01i, where\ns0 = \u22121 is the coupling sign of the auxiliary qubit with mode\nB and\nq\n1\np = \u2212 (\u22060 /\u03a9 + i 2 \u2212 \u220620 /\u03a92 ),\n(28)\n2\n\nwith \u22060 = \u03c9A \u2212 \u03c90 \u221a\n= \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9B , it follows that |p|2 = 1/2\nwhenever 0 \u2264 \u22060 \u2264 2\u03a9, leaving the fields in |\u03c8c i which is\nl.u. to the Bell state (11). The auxiliary qubit at the end of this\nstep is in the spin down state and is disregarded thereafter.\nWe now let N qubits, each of them initially in the spin down\nstate, simultaneously interact with the entangled modes. We\nagain consider the case where all the coupling signs sk are positive.

Careful analysis of (32) and (34) reveals that\nthe time required to generate WN +2 or WN states decreases\nwith N . A similar result is presented in [30]. We emphasize\nthat due to its importance in the multipartite entanglement theory [31], many different schemes for generation of W states\nhave been previously proposed [32\u201340], and their experimental realization has also been reported [41\u201345].\nIII.\n\nGENERATION OF W, GHZ, AND CLUSTER STATES\nWITH BIMODAL DISPERSIVE INTERACTIONS\n\nIt is a well known fact that a single bosonic mode may mediate interactions between two previously non-interacting qubits\n[46]. Consider for example that the mode frequency is sufficiently apart from the qubit frequencies (taken to be all equal),\nthe so-called dispersive limit. In the two-qubit case, the mode\nin the vacuum state then induces a dipole-dipole interaction\nbetween the two qubits (XY interaction), allowing the generation of a Bell state at certain times of interaction [46]. In the\nfollowing, we consider the dynamics far from resonance of two\nmodes simultaneously interacting with N qubits, and explore\nthe role played by the phases of the coupling constants.\nThe simultaneous interaction of N qubits with two nondegenerate modes is described in the interaction picture by the\nHamiltonian\nN\nX\n(a\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 ei\u2206t + a\u03c3k+ e\u2212i\u2206t )\nHI (t) = \u03a9\nk=1\n\n+\u03a9\n\nN\nX\n\nsk (b\u2020 \u03c3k\u2212 e\u2212i\u2206t + b\u03c3k+ ei\u2206t ),\n\n(36)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere we have again set the qubit frequencies (\u03c9) midway the\nmodes frequency separation, so that \u2206 = \u03c9A \u2212 \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9B ,\nwith \u03c9A > \u03c9B .\nThe dispersive limit is obtained when the detuning \u2206 is sufficiently larger than the coupling constant \u03a9. Following the\nmethod described in [47], we obtain from (36) the effective\nHamiltonian\nHeff = \u2212\u03bb(a\u2020 a \u2212 b\u2020 b)\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c3kz \u2212 \u03bb\n\nN\nX\nj,k\n\n(1 \u2212 sj sk )\u03c3j+ \u03c3k\u2212 , (37)\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u2206 /\u03a9 is the effective qubit-qubit coupling constant\ninduced by the modes.\n2\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nA. W states\n\nFor N = 1, the above Hamiltonian has already been considered for the generation of multidimensional entangled coherent states of two cavity modes [48]. The first term of the\nabove equation describes the Stark-shifts. These induced shifts\nmay cancel each other if the modes are prepared in Fock states\nwith equal number of photons (or simply in the vacuum). The\nsecond term (dipole-dipole interactions induced by the modes)\nmay be totally inhibited if sk = 1 for all k. This occurs because\nthe interaction between qubits j and k induced by the mode A\ncancels the interaction induced by the mode B. Clearly, this\neffect is absent when only one mode interacts with the qubits.\nWe may then state a general rule that given two qubits with\nsj and sk , the induced dipole-dipole interaction between them\nwill be inhibited whenever sj = sk . The contrary is also true,\ni.e. their induced dipole-dipole interaction will be doubled provided sj = \u2212sk .\nWe still consider cancellation of the Stark-shifts in (37). We\nthen consider that only one of the N qubits is initially in the\nspin up state, say the first qubit, and the others are in the fundamental state, so that the initial state of the qubits is \u03c31+ |\u2193i\u2297N .\nIf we set s1 = \u22121 and sk = 1, for k > 1, the state of the N\nqubits after simultaneously interacting with modes will be (at\na time t)\n|\u03c8N (t)i =\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\n(k)\n\ncN (t)\u03c3k+ |\u2193i\u2297N ,\n\n(38)\n\nwith coefficients\n\u221a\n(1)\ncN (t) = cos(2 N \u2212 1\u03bbt),\n\u221a\nsin(2 N \u2212 1\u03bbt)\n(k6=1)\n\u221a\ncN (t) = i\n.\nN \u22121\n\n(39)\n(40)\n\nThis configuration is also useful for generating more kinds\nof multipartite entangled states when we leave the oneexcitation sector of the system Hamiltonian. For example, if\nthe qubits are prepared\nin the state |+1 i|+2 i|+3 i \u2261 |+++i,\n\u221a\nwith |+j i = (1/ 2)(|\u2191j i+|\u2193ij ), the evolved state after a time\nt will be\n1\n|\u03c8(t)i = \u221a [|\u2191\u2191\u2191i + (\u03bc + i\u03bd)|\u2191\u2191\u2193i + (\u03bc + i\u03bd)|\u2191\u2193\u2191i\n2 2\n+(\u03bc + 2i\u03bd)|\u2191\u2193\u2193i + (\u03bc + 2i\u03bd)|\u2193\u2191\u2191i\n+(\u03bc + i\u03bd)|\u2193\u2191\u2193i + (\u03bc + i\u03bd)|\u2193\u2193\u2191i + |\u2193\u2193\u2193i], (44)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bc = cos 2 2\u03bbt and \u03bd = (1/ 2) sin 2 2\u03bbt. Hence,\n\u221a if\nwe let the qubits interact with the modes for \u03bbt = \u03c0/(2 2),\nthe following state will be generated\n1\n|\u03c8i = \u221a (|\u2191\u2191\u2191i \u2212 |\u2191\u2191\u2193i \u2212 |\u2191\u2193\u2191i \u2212 |\u2191\u2193\u2193i\n2 2\n\u2212|\u2193\u2191\u2191i \u2212 |\u2193\u2191\u2193i \u2212 |\u2193\u2193\u2191i + |\u2193\u2193\u2193i),\n(45)\n\u221a\nwhich is l.u. to the GHZ state, e.g. V U |\u03c8i = (1/ 2)(|\u2191\u2191\u2191i +\nx 1/2\n\u2297 (i\u03c32z )1/2 \u2297 (i\u03c33z )1/2 and\n|\u2193\u2193\u2193i), where\n\u221a z U = (\u2212i\u03c31 )\nV = (\u2212 i)\u03c31 \u2297H2 \u2297H3 , with Hi representing the Hadamard\noperation on qubit i. It is known that U belongs to a set of local\nClifford unitaries mapping the whole equivalence class associated with a given graph state [49\u201351]. The GHZ state has an\nimportant role in the study of fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (GHZ) have shown\nthat the predictions of local realistic theories and quantum mechanics are completely different using this state [52]. Other\ntheoretical proposals for generation of GHZ states have been\npreviously published [53\u201356] as well as its experimental realization [57\u201361].\n\nFrom this follows that\nq\n\nGHZ states\n\nC.

GENERATION SCHEMES IN THE PRESENCE OF\nIMPERFECTIONS\n\n1.00\nF\n0.98\n\nIn this section we analyze the effects of usual imperfections\nthat may arise in a realistic setup. Whereas the preceding results were put in the general language of bosonic modes and\nqubits, the sources of imperfections we are going to discuss\nare well suited for the cavity QED context, where two-level\natoms (qubits) can interact with bosonic modes sustained by\na cavity. We separate the analysis of imperfections in three\nsubsections. In Section IV A, we investigate the effect of dissipative environments in the generation schemes of previous\nsections. In Section IV B, we estimate the error in the state\npreparation arising from the intrinsic uncontrollability of the\ntime of flight of atoms. Both sourcesp\nof imperfections will be\nanalyzed in terms of the fidelity F = h\u03c8|\u03c1|\u03c8i [2], where |\u03c8i\nis the ideally generated (target) state and \u03c1 is the result in the\npresence of imperfections. In Section IV C, we show the possibility of violation of local realism considering our generation\nprotocol of cluster states in the presence of such imperfections.\n\n0.96\n\nIn real experiments, one usually faces the effects of many decoherence channels. For the system considered here, the most\nrelevant damages to the dynamics come from photon leakage\nfrom cavity mirrors and fluorescent radiation from the atoms\n(spontaneous emission). The usual formalism to treat irreversible decaying processes considers the coupling of the system to large reservoirs, generally modeled as baths of harmonic\noscillators [72]. Here we consider zero temperature local reservoirs for each subsystem.\nWe start by considering dissipation in the generation\nschemes of Section II. In the rotating-wave and Born-Markov\napproximations, the density operator for the system obeys the\nfollowing master equation [72]\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\nLk \u03c1(t),\n(48)\n\nwhere H\u0303k is given by (3),\n\u03baA\n([a, \u03c1(t)a\u2020 ] + [a\u03c1(t), a\u2020 ]),\n2\n\u03baB\nLB \u03c1(t) =\n([b, \u03c1(t)b\u2020 ] + [b\u03c1(t), b\u2020 ]),\n2\n\u03b3\nLk \u03c1(t) = ([\u03c3k\u2212 , \u03c1(t)\u03c3k+ ] + [\u03c3k\u2212 \u03c1(t), \u03c3k\u2212 ]),\n2\nLA \u03c1(t) =\n\n0.92\n0.00\n1.00\nF\n0.98\n\n(49)\n(50)\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n\u03c7/\u03a9\n\n0.10\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n\u03c7/\u03a9\n\n0.10\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n\u03c7/\u03a9\n\n0.10\n\n0.96\n0.94\n0.92\n0.00\n1.00\nF\n0.98\n0.96\n0.94\n0.92\n0.00\n\nA.

In these cases, the master\nequation (48) is still valid with the only modification being the\nreplacement of H\u0303k for Heff , the latter given by (37). Once the\nmodes are still prepared in vacuum states, we may still disregard the Stark-shifts appearing in (37) as well as any losses\ndue to cavity damping. It can now be seen from Figure 2 that\nthe W states protocols are again more robust in the presence of\nlosses, now compared to the protocol for generating the GHZ3\nstate. Notably, the generation scheme for WT is still the most\nrobust.\nThe analysis of imperfections for the cluster state is pre-\n\n(51)\n\nare the Lindblad operators acting on the density operator \u03c1(t),\n\u03baA , \u03baB , and \u03b3 are the decay rates for cavity mode A, B and\nthe atoms, respectively.\nIn Figure 1, we plot the fidelity between \u03c1 and |\u03c8i as a function of \u03c7/\u03a9 for three different target states. In these calculations, \u03c1 is \u221a\nalso considered at an interaction time given by (9)\nwith \u2206 = 2\u03a9. The parameter \u03c7 is used to embody different\nconfigurations for the decay rates. These plots show that the\nworst situation corresponds to that of equal dissipation rates\n(cavity modes and atoms).

In realistic setups, however, it might\nhappen that the atoms will not enter the cavity exactly at the\nsame time, consequently inducing an error in the target state\ngeneration. In the case involving only two atoms, the inclusion of such error source is a simple matter as discussed, for\ninstance, in reference [46]. The approach consists of supposing one of the atoms reaching the cavity in advance or in delay\ncompared to the alleged initial interaction time.\nWe need to generalize this approach in order to analyze this\nsource of error in our protocols. We do this by choosing the\ntime each atom enters the cavity from a normal (Gaussian)\ndistribution centered at t = 0 (the ideal time for entering the\ncavity). The uncontrollability of the time of flights translates\nthen as finite standard deviations for the normal distribution.\nIn Figure 3, each point in the plotted fidelities corresponds to\nan average over many realizations, each one having the same\nstandard deviation measured as a fraction (percentage) of 1/\u03bb.\n1.00\nF\u0304\n0.98\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n\u00e7\n\u00f3\n\u00e1\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00f3\n\u00e1\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n0.96\n\n\u00f3\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\u00e1\n\n0.94\n\n\u00e1\n\u00f3\n\n0.92\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n%(1/\u03bb) 10\n\nFIG. 3.

Also, the GHZ3 state protocol, which\nwas previously shown to be more sensitive to energy relaxation, turns out now to be more robust than the other protocols\nfor errors in the time control.\n\nC. Cluster state nonlocality under imperfections\n\nIn reference [73], Scarani, Ac\u0131\u0301n, Schenck and Aspelmeyer\nintroduced a nonlocality test (hereafter mnemonically referred\nto as SASA inequality) suitable for cluster states.

Here, 3, 000\nrepetitions have been considered to evaluate the average hBi.\n\nand any local realistic theory will lead to hBi \u2264 2.

The experimental verification of violation of the\nSASA inequality by linear cluster states l.u. to (53) has been\ndemonstrated [74, 75].\nIn order to evaluate the expectation value of the SASA operator in form (52), using the cluster state |\u03c8i generated in our\nprotocol, all one have to realize is that T |\u03c8i = |\u03c64 i with\nT = \u2212H1 \u03c31x \u2297 1 2 \u2297 \u03c33x \u2297 H4 .\n\n(54)\n\nFollowing the same guidelines explained in the last subsections, we now analyze the effect of dissipation and time of\nflight fluctuations on the violation of the SASA inequality as\nshown in Figure 4. It is a remarkable fact that hBi is quite robust against error in the control of atomic times of flight. Besides, the nonlocality of the state generated under these imperfections is revealed even near the weak coupling regime where\nthe dissipation constants are comparable to the coupling constants. To be more specific, hBi \u2264 2 for decay constants only\nsmaller than \u03b3 \u2248 0.4\u03bb.\nV. CAVITY QED SETUPS\n\nSince some protocols presented in this work are supported\nby the ability of willingly choosing magnitudes and phases of\n\n\f8\n(j)\n\ncavity 2\n\u2193\n\nwith kn = \u03c9n /c = n\u03c0/L and deg denoting the dipole matrix\nelement of atom j. Once we are dealing with identical atoms,\nwe may suppose equal values for any atomic dipole matrix el(j)\nements deg . Under appropriate choices of polarization and by\nconsidering the atomic frequency midway the separation of the\nnatural frequencies of consecutive cavity modes, say n and\nn + 1, the above Hamiltonian may be reduced to effectively\ncontain two modes\n\ndielectric\n\nbarrier\n\ncavity 1\n\u2193\n\n(j)\n\nFIG. 5. Sketch of the setup proposed in [8] showing cavities 1 and 2\nand the dielectric barrier. The degenerate eigenfunctions are pictorially depicted.\n\natom-field coupling constants, we need now to discuss these\nassumptions on potential physical setups.\nA. Proposition I\n\nOne possible setup consists of two weakly coupled identical\ncavities 1 and 2 and flying atoms [8]. These cavities are actually the two halves of a perfectly conducting rectangular resonator divided by an insulating barrier of suitable thickness and\ndielectric constant. The experimenter is then endowed with\nthe choice about which cavity each atom will be sent through.\nThe special feature of this system that allows one to willingly\nchose the coupling constant phases is that two weakly coupled\nidentical cavities possess two nearly degenerate eigenfunctions\n(frequency split is approximately proportional to the amplitude\ntransmissivity of the barrier): one symmetric and the other antisymmetric, with respect to the junction of the cavities, as\nshown in Figure 5. Consequently, when sent to cavity 1, an\natom interacts with two positively-valued mode functions, and\nwhen sent to cavity 2 it interacts with modes having opposite\nvalues. This fits perfectly the needs for phase control found in\nour state generation protocols.\nB.\n\nProposition II\n\nNow we consider a one-dimensional model describing the\ninteraction of a two-level atom j and M field modes inside\na cavity [76]. Such a simplified version of the general twoor three-dimensional model still reveals the essential features\nof the dynamics [76, 77]. Under the dipole and rotating-wave\napproximations, the interaction Hamiltonian can be cast in the\nform\nHint =\n\nM\nX\n\ngn(j) (a\u2020n \u03c3j\u2212 + an \u03c3j+ ),\n\n(55)\n\nn\n\nwhere the position-dependent coupling constant for the atom j\nand mode n is given by\nr\n\u03c9n (j)\n(j)\ngn =\nd sin(kn rj ),\n(56)\n\u01eb0 L eg\n\nHint = gn(j) (a\u2020n \u03c3j\u2212 + an \u03c3j+ ) + gn+1 (a\u2020n+1 \u03c3j\u2212 + an+1 \u03c3j+ ).\n(57)\nThe problem consists in finding solutions for equations of the\nkind\nq\nq\nk\u0303n sin[k\u0303n (r\u0303j + 1/2)] = \u00b1 k\u0303n+1 sin[k\u0303n+1 (r\u0303j + 1/2)],\n(58)\nfor any atom j and two selected modes, where we have defined\nparameters scaled by the cavity length, i.e. k\u0303n = Lkn = n\u03c0\nand r\u0303j = rj /L and set the origin r\u0303j = 0 to be the center of\nthe cavity, i.e. the cavity mirrors are located at \u2212L/2 and L/2.\nFrom now on, we will consider the lowest order modes 1 and\n2 to illustrate the general idea.\nLet us consider first the scheme in Section II A, where one\natom (j = 1) interacts with each of two modes with coupling\nconstants with either equal or opposite phases. In this case, we\nmust solve the simple equation\nq\nq\nk\u03031 sin[k\u03031 (r\u03031 + 1/2)] = \u00b1 k\u03032 sin[k\u03032 (r\u03031 + 1/2)]. (59)\n1\n), with the minus\nIt is easy to find that r\u03031 = \u2213 \u03c01 arcsin( 2\u221a\n2\nreferring to the case with equal phases and the plus the other\nway round. Of course, other positions for the atom may be\nobtained if we select modes with higher n and n + 1.\nFor the schemes with two or more atoms crossing simultaneously the cavity (Sec. refsec:disp), we have to find solutions of system of equations involving terms of the kind\n(58). In the case of two atoms there is a solution valid for\n1\nequal couplings with opposite phases [r\u03031 = \u03c01 arcsin( 2\u221a\n)\n2\n1\n1\nand r\u03032 = \u2212 \u03c0 arcsin( 2\u221a2 )]. However, in contrast with the\nfirst proposition, any other solutions are not physical for this\nsetup . The reason is that they imply putting more than one\natom at the same point in the cavity axis. This is a very unfavorable situation because, even if we tolerated some error\nin the magnitude of the coupling constant by considering both\natoms at slightly equal positions, we would still be in trouble\nbecause direct dipole-dipole coupling could not be neglected.\nThis would alter the Hamiltonians used in the protocols in a\nvery substantial way. There might still be a solution for this\nproblem in the 2D and 3D versions of the model, but we leave\nthis possibility for future investigations.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWe first considered the quasi resonant interaction of two\nmodes with either one qubit at time or with N qubits. In the\none excitation sector of the system Hamiltonian, we found the\ndeterministic generation of bosonic Bell states between two\nmodes. W states may also be generated either among the two\nmodes and the qubits or among the N qubits. However, when\n\n\f9\nthrough the cavity. The results showed good fidelities for an\nappreciable range of the parameters involved. As an application of our generation protocols, we investigated nonlocality\ntests for the cluster state in the presence of those imperfections.\nThe results are also very robust showing violation of the SASA\ninequality for dissipative rates very close to the weak coupling\nregime of cavity QED. The quest for quantum effects in typically unfavorable situations (like the weak coupling regime)\nis a very active research area [78]. The violation of SASA inequality under such severe imprecisions makes our protocols\nuseful for this kind of investigation.\n\nconsidering the simultaneous interaction of the modes with the\nqubits, we observed that the generation of W states occurs only\nfor N = 2 or N = 4. To circumvent this constraint, we\nslightly modified the scheme by first preparing the modes in\na Bell state. Thus, with the excitation initially stored in this\nentangled state, WN +2 and WN states are generated for all N .\nAlso, we observed that the generation of these states becomes\nfaster with the increase of N .\nIn the far off resonance interaction, we analyze the effective\ndynamics when two non-degenerate modes interact simultaneously with N qubits. When only one excitation is present, it\nis possible to generate a wide class of W states involving N\nqubits, and again the interaction time decreases with N . We\nalso observed the generation of GHZ states among three qubits\ninitially prepared in coherent superpositions of spin down and\nspin up states. With two excitations in the system, we showed\nthe one-step generation of cluster states among four qubits.\nWe would like to remark that all the protocols for generation\nof multipartite entangled states presented here are deterministic (no measurements). This became possible due to quantum\ninterferences arising from different choices of coupling constant phases.\nWe also studied these generation schemes under the the presence of important sources of imperfections such as energy relaxation and fluctuations in the time of flight of the atoms\n\nP.P.M. thanks the financial support from Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de\nAperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u0131\u0301vel Superior (CAPES) and\nConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq), under Grant N.
