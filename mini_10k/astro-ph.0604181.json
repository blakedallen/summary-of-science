The suppression of the optical emissions from D-GRBs should results\nfrom circumburst but not their central engine.\n\nKey words: gamma rays: bursts\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOver the 8 years since the afterglow was discovered, more than one hundred of bursts\nwere well-localized and their counterparts in the X-ray, optical/IR, and radio bands\nwere detected. About ninety percent of these well-localized bursts are X-ray afterglow\ndetected, but about half of them have not optical transient (OT) detection, which are\nthe so called optically dark GRBs (Groot et al. 1998; Fynbo et al. 2001; Reichart & Yost\n2001). Before Swift era being due to the lack of early afterglow observations, it is thought\nthat dark bursts might be a bias of late and shallow observations. However, very tight\nlimits at very early phases made by Swift UV-optical telescope (UVOT) have shown\nthat about 50% of swift GRBs are indeed phenomenally dark (Roming et al. 2005). The\n\u22c6 E-mail: yqlin@nju.edu.cn\n\n\f2\n\nLin\n\nnature of the dark GRBs becomes a great issue. Several arguments have been proposed\nfor explanation of the nature of dark bursts. Extinction by dust and gas of host galaxy\n(e.g., Taylor et al. 1998; Djorgovski et al. 2001; Piro et al. 2002) and/or circumburst\nabsorption (Lazzati, Covino, & Ghisellini 2002; Fynbo et al. 2002) are intuitionistic\nexplanations. However, the faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of bright\nGRB 020124, combined with the low inferred extinction, indicate that some dark bursts\nare intrinsically dim and not dust obscured (Berger et al. 2002). The Ly-\u03b1 blanketing and\nabsorption effect due to high redshift is also proposed (Fynbo et al. 2002; Groot et al.\n1998). However, the redshifts of two typical dark bursts, GRB970828 and GRB000210,\nare normal as bright GRBs. Recently, Roming et al. (2005) argued that dark GRBs may\nbe intrinsically faint and/or high efficiency gamma-ray emissions, which should result\nin their cooling frequency closed to the X-ray band (Pedersen et al. 2005) and faint at\noptical wavelengths (e.g. Lazzati, Covino, & Ghisellini 2002; Fynbo et al. 2002).\nX-ray afterglow is a main probe to detect the difference of bright and dark GRBs.\nDe Pasquale et al. (2003) systematically compared the X-ray fluxes by extrapolating the\nX-ray flux to 10 hours after GRB trigger and found that dark GRBs tend to have a lower\nX-ray fluxes. Jakobsson et al. (2004) used a jointed optical-to-X-ray spectral index to\ndiscriminate the dark and bright GRBs by the X-ray and optical afterglows at 11 hours\nsince GRB trigger. Rol et al. (2005) try to quantify the degree of the optical darkness by\ncomparing optical upper limits and the inferred optical fluxes from X-ray fluxes based on\nstandard afterglow model. However, two significant biases are involved in the late X-ray\nafterglow data used by previous authors. The first one is sample biased. Being due to the\nlack of early and deep optical observation, some previous dark GRBs might be bright\nGRBs. The optical afterglow observations of previous GRBs were made at significantly\ndifferent epoch. This also results in an inhomogenous effect for the sample selection.\nSecondly, XRT observations have revealed that the early X-ray afterglows of GRBs are\nenormously different from the late ones. In this work we systematically analyze the early\nX-ray afterglows observed by the Swift/XRT for bright and dark GRBs. We collect the\nSwift GRB data up to June, 2005. There are 25 bursts are included. We present our\nsample in section 2. The results are presented in section 3, 4 and section 5. Conclusion\nand discussion are presented in section 6.\n\n2 SAMPLES\nFor seeking of homogenity and reliability, we include only Swift GRBs into our sample. Twenty-five GRBs are included. We identify those GRBs without OT detection by\nSwift/UVOT and(or) ground-based telescopes as dark GRBs. In our sample 12 bursts\nare dark GRBs.\n\n\fThe early X-ray afterglows of optically bright and dark GRBs\n\n3\n\nThe X-ray afterglow of the bursts in our sample are observed by Swift/XRT from\n\u223c 102 s up to 105 s since GRB trigger. We measure the X-ray afterglows at a given time\nfor our purpose. This given time should be early enough and the X-ray fluxes at this\ntime should be reliably measured from the XRT light curves of most bursts. We take\nthis time as 1 hour after GRB trigger. Our considerations are as follows. First, most of\nthe XRT light curves have a bright and steep tail in the early phase lasting from \u223c 102\ns up to \u223c 103 s. These tails are believed to be from prompt emissions. To reduce the\ncontamination from the tail emissions, we should select a time that it is later than 103\nseconds. Second, more than half of the XRT light curves have a gap around 1500-3000\nseconds lacking of observations. We should also skip this period. We notice that around\n1 hour since GRB trigger most of XRT light curves begin to evolve as power law with\na normal index (\u223c \u22121). At this time the fluxes are also not affect by the jet effect1 . We\nthus study the X-ray flux at 1 hour since GRBs trigger.\nTheir X-ray afterglow fluxes (FX ) at 1 hour after GRB trigger are read off or extrapolated/interpolated from their X-ray light curves observed by Swift X-ray telescope\n(XRT). Their gamma-ray fluences S\u03b3 and the duration (T90 ) in 15-350 keV are also collected from literature. They are listed in Table 1 with the followings headings: GRB,\ngamma-ray fluence (S\u03b3 ) in 15-350 keV band (in unit of 10\u22126 ergs cm\u22122 ), GRB duration\n(T90 ) in 15-350 keV, X-ray afterglow flux (FX ) in 0.3-10 keV band at 1 hour since GRB\ntrigger, and references.\n\n3 EARLY X-RAY FLUX AS A FUNCTION OF GAMMA-RAY\nFLUENCES\nWith the data shown in Table 1 we show the two-dimensional distributions of the gammaray fluences and the X-ray fluxes in Figure 1. It shows that the two quantities are correlated for both the B-GRBs and the D-GRBs (panel a), with Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.79 \u00b1 0.40 (the chance probability p < 0.0001) for B-GRBs and r = 0.60 \u00b1 0.58\n(p = 0.01) for the D-GRBs. The best fitting results are also shown in the panel (a) of\nFigure 1. They show that the D-GRBs tend to have a larger ratio of S\u03b3 /FX than the\nB-GRBs. The dispersion of the correlation for the D-GRBs is significantly larger than\nthat for the B-GRBs.\nFrom Figure 1 one can observe that both S\u03b3 and FX expand almost the same ranges\nfor the D-GRBs and B-GRBs. While the S\u03b3 of the D-GRBs tends to be slightly larger\nthan that of the B-GRBs, the FX of the D-GRBs tends to be slightly smaller than that\nof the B-GRBs.\n1\n\nThe jet break is usually greater than half a day\n\n\f4\n\nLin\n4\n\n(c)\n\nN\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n-4\n\nLog S /erg cm\n\n-2\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n-7\n-13\n\n-12\n\n-11\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n-9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nN\n\nLog F /erg cm\nx\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\ns\n\nFig. 1 Two-dimensional distributions of the gamma-ray fluences and the X-ray\nfluxes for the optically bright [open circles in panel (a) and solid lines in panel\n(b) and (c)] and the optically dark GRBs [solid circles in panel (a) and dotted\nlines in panels (b) and (c)]. The solid and dotted lines in the panel (a) are the\nbest fit results for the bright and dark GRBs, respectively.\n\n4 RATIO OF EARLY X-RAY AFTERGLOW FLUX TO AVERAGE\nGAMMA-RAY FLUX\nGRBs are from cosmological distance. The observables must be affected by the cosmological effect. Since most of the bursts in our sample have no redshift measurements, we\ncould not make the cosmological corrections. The hardness ratio between two observed\nenergy bands is independent of the cosmological effect. We thus study the hardness ratios\nof the two kinds of GRBs. The hardness ratio is calculated by the average gamma-ray\nflux to the X-ray flux, which is R\u03b3,X = F\u03b3 /FX , where F\u03b3 is the average gamma-ray\nflux over the duration (T90 ) in 15-350 keV band . The distributions of R\u03b3,X for the two\nkinds of GRBs are shown in Figure 2. The two-dimensional distributions in the panel (a)\nof Figure 2 show that two kinds of GRBs are mixed together without any classification\nsignatures. The panel (b) of Figure 2 shows that the R\u03b3,X distributions for the two kinds\nof GRBs are similar, with the R\u03b3,X of the D-GRBs being slightly larger than that of the\nB-GRBs. We perform a K-S test to examine whether or not the two distributions are\nfrom the same parent. The significant level for the null hypothesis that two data sets are\nfrom the same distribution is PKS = 0.098. The null hypothesis is marginally accepted.\n\n\fThe early X-ray afterglows of optically bright and dark GRBs\n\n5\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n5\n\n-6\n\nN\n\nLog F /erg cm\n\n-2\n\ns\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n-7\n2\n\n1\n\n-8\n-13\n\n0\n-12\n\n-11\n\nLog F / erg cm\nx\n\n-10\n-2\n\n-1\n\ns\n\n-9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nLog R\n\n5\n\n6\n\nx\n\nFig. 2 Two-dimensional distributions of the average gamma-ray fluxes and the\nX-ray fluxes for the optically bright [open circles in panel (a) and solid lines in\npanel (b)] and the optically dark GRBs [solid circles in panel (a) and dotted\nlines in panels (b)].\n\n5 BOOTSTRAP TEST\nDe Pasquale et al. (2003) found that the extrapolated X-ray afterglow fluxes at 11 hours\nsince GRB trigger of the D-GRBs tend to be weaker than that of the B-GRBs with\na factor \u223c 6. The means of the FX for the D-GRBs and B-GRBs in our sample are\nlog FX = \u221211.39 \u00b1 0.82 and log FX = \u221210.66 \u00b1 0.85, respectively. The log FX of the\nD-GRBs is slightly smaller than that of B-GRBs with a factor of \u223c 5. However, this\ndifference is within the large error scopes of the means, and it is not in any statistical\nsense. The K-S test indicates that the FX distributions for both D-GRBs and B-GRBs\nare drawn from the same parent. We use a bootstrap method to examine if the slight\ndifference between them is due to the statistical fluctuation. We bootstrap 103 pair\nsamples of D-GRBs and B-GRBs, and then calculate the PKS for each pair sample. The\ndistribution of the PKS is shown in Figure 3, indicating the hypothesis that the pair\nsamples are drawn from the same parent is accepted at a significance level of \u223c 3\u03c3. We\nalso combine each pair samples as an assembled sample and then apply KMM algorithm\n(Ashman et al. 1994) to examine if the assembled sample can be classified as two unique\ngroups. It is found that the null hypothesis, which suggests that the assembled sample is\nclassified into two unique groups, is ruled out at a significance level of \u223c 3\u03c3.\n\n\f6\n\nLin\n0.25\n\nProbability\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nLog P\n\nks\n\nFig. 3 The PKS distribution for 103 pair bootstrap samples.\n\n6 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\nWith a homogenous sample detected by Swift we have shown that the distributions of\nFX , S\u03b3 , and R\u03b3,X for both the D-GRBs and B-GRBs are from the same parent. These\nresults indicate that the progenitors of the two kinds of GRBs are the same population.\nTheir total energy explosions are comparable. The suppression of the optical emissions\nfrom D-GRBs should be resulted from circumburst.\nAs suggested by Roming et al. (2005), the mechanisms to suppress the optical emissions from the D-GRBs might be diverse. This diversity may reflect the variety of the\ncircumburst. The extinction effect is the most popular model to explain these D-GRBs.\nHowever, the dust in the host galaxy may be destroyed by early radiation from \u03b3-ray\nburst and their afterglows (Waxman & Draine 2000; Fruchter et al. 2001). It is found\nthat the optical extinctions are 10\u223c100 times smaller than expected from X-ray absorption (Galama et al. 2001). We examine the X-ray absorptions in our GRB sample. We\ndo not find systematically difference of excess nH values for the D-GRBs and B-GRBs.\nExtinction effect alone is hard to explain the nature of the darkness of these GRBs. The\ndarkness should be responsible for more physical mechanisms. Most recently, Liang &\nZhang (2005) found an intriguing results that within optically bright GRBs there exists\ntwo unique classes of GRBs with late optical afterglows. In their sample a minority of\nGRBs have a luminosity dimmer than the typical ones with a factor \u223c 30. If this is true\nthe nature of the dim group may cast a light on the D-GRBs.\n\n\fThe early X-ray afterglows of optically bright and dark GRBs\n\n7\n\nHere we give a possible explanation that the optical dark bursts may be caused by\nthe synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) (Granot, Piran 1999). If the SSA frequency is a\nlittle greater than the observed optical frequency, which may be caused by the larger\ncircum-density (Sari 1998) or more loading baryons, the optical afterglow will be darker\nthan that in the case that the SSA can be neglected.\nAcknowledgements YQL thanks Z.
