Introduction\nThe analysis will be done in a way that will create a list of\nlargest political parties in the Republic of Macedonia, their\ncommunications infrastructure through ICT (website),\ncontent and the manner in which they placed their\ninformation and receive feedback from voters.\nInternet, social networking, Web 2.0, Facebook, YouTube,\nblog ... All these are relatively new word in the political\nvocabulary, new concepts, new media and new\nopportunities for the transmission of ideas and messages\nare not enough channels used to communicate with the\npublic. Although the practice of using the Internet in local\npolitical advertising goes back to the nineties, only in\nrecent years the advent of new tools and social networks\ndemonstrates true strength of this medium.\nBesides direct access to the public, political ideas, it\nprovides full force confrontation, but also provides a\nrelatively convenient ground for review of public attitudes,\nresearch and development of certain ideas. Using such a\nchange in social communication, transmission of political\n\nmessages through the transition from traditional forms of\ncommunication and finding new paths to the recipients.\nProfessional and political public for years following the\ndevelopment of the Internet as a medium, but he showed\nthe greatest strength in the last U.S. presidential election.\nPolitical power depends on the satisfaction of the people\ntowards a particular party and party connections with other\nparties or organizations. Well-developed social network\nprovides further prestige and power of the party and its\ndirect channel of communication with voters and other\ninfluential interests groups.\n\n3. Political Communication through Internet\nInternet and politics in the modern world have become\ninseparable and thus gradually eliminating barriers to free\nflow of information between the political decision-makers\nand those in whose name the benefits they bring (the\npublic). Countries in transition must follow the\ncontemporary trends of fitting of the Internet in the area of\npolitical communication, which simultaneously causes the\nchange to the model that is still the dominant, of political\ncommunication based on secrecy and lack of transparency.\nIn Macedonia, the network and politics are still not\ntogether, except in the case of international organizations.\nInternet is not fully incorporated into political\ncommunication (or, more precisely, it is not done\nproperly). A key condition (requirement) for this is\napplication of technology and simultaneous transformation\nof consciousness. This change requires the rejection of the\nprinciple of confidentiality as a condition of political\nactivity of government and party, because it is absolutely\ncontrary to the nature of the Internet. It is necessary also to\nstrengthen the awareness of the importance of on-line\ncrystallization of public opinion, and more intensive and\nbetter connection of on-line and off-line political stage.\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\n4. Impact of Social network analysis in\npolitics\nPolitical communication is a new and exciting area of\nresearch and teaching that is located at the crossroads of\nthe study of communication, political parties and electoral\nbehavior. As well as profiling the changing nature of the\nmedia system such an approach invariably leads us onto\nwhat we term the 'new political communication' - that\nbased around the new Information and Communication\nTechnologies (ICTs). We examine the work that has been\ndone on the uses of the new media by parties and\npoliticians across a range of democratic contexts and offer\nsome insights into the strong challenges they introduce for\nthe established manufacturers of political communication.\nOne of the key uses of the Internet is to build databases of\nvoter data and access that through different applications\nfor different purposes. Because data entry can be easily\ndone automatically by scanners or by hand more\ncampaigns and political operatives are recognizing the\nimportance of capturing, storing, analyzing and using voter\ninformation. What used to take days of analyzing can now\ntake minutes by using computers to analyze important\ninformation. That data can also be used offline or online\nfor a number of different ways and the usage of these\nsystems have become key components of the political\nsystem.\nThroughout history political campaigns have evolved\naround the advancing technologies that are available to\ncandidates. As technology develops, candidates are able to\npermeate the lives of citizens on a daily basis. Television,\nradio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, yard signs,\nbumper stickers, and Internet websites all create a means\nof spreading political platforms.\nWhile the traditional forms of media are still an integral\nportion of campaign strategy, the availability of the\nInternet opens the door of campaign tools waiting for\ncandidate's attention. The Internet provides numerous\nopportunities for politicians to reach the polity. Among\nthose is a new phenomenon called social networking\nwebsites. Social networking sites have gained popularity\nin the last few years. These sites are growing popular\nparticularly on college campuses nationwide. Specifically\nsocial networking websites such as MySpace and\nFacebook have provided users with a new form of\ncommunication. When new forms of communication are\nmade available, political candidates begin to use the new\ntechnology to their advantage. What social networking\nwebsites allow politicians to do is to create a sense of\npersonalized communication with their constituents. This\npersonalization of politics enables voters and politicians\nalike to feel as though a connection is made. The Internet\ncan make direct communication possible among\n\n155\n\ngovernment officials, candidates, parties, and citizens. As\nhistory shows us, when new technologies are made\navailable, they begin to reshape the personalization factor\nbetween the candidate and the voter. This increase in\ninterpersonal interactivity has shown to offer opportunities\nand increase success for political campaigns.\n\n5. Political Parties in Republic of Macedonia\n5.1. Overview of the political system\nMacedonia is a Republic having multi-party parliamentary\ndemocracy and a political system with strict division into\nlegislative, executive and judicial branches. From 1945\nMacedonia had been a sovereign Republic within Federal\nYugoslavia and on September 8, 1991, following the\nreferendum of its citizens, Macedonia was proclaimed a\nsovereign and independent state. The Constitution of the\nRepublic of Macedonia was adopted on November 17,\n1991, by the first multiparty parliament. The basic\nintention was to constitute Macedonia as a sovereign and\nindependent, civil and democratic state and also to create\nan institutional framework for the development of\nparliamentary democracy, guaranteeing human rights, civil\nliberties and national equality.\nThe Assembly is the central and most important institution\nof state authority. According to the Constitution it is a\nrepresentative body of the citizens and the legislative\npower of the Republic is vested in it. The Assembly is\ncomposed of 120 seats.\nThe President of the Republic of Macedonia represents the\nRepublic, and is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed\nForces of Macedonia. He is elected in general and direct\nelections, for a term of five years, and two terms at most.\nExecutive power of the Republic of Macedonia is\nbicephalous and is divided between the Government and\nthe President of the Republic. The Government is elected\nby the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia by a\nmajority vote of the total number of Representatives, and\nis accountable for its work to the Assembly. The\norganization and work of the Government is defined by a\nlaw on the Government.\nIn accordance with its constitutional competencies,\nexecutive power is vested in the Government of the\nRepublic of Macedonia. It is the highest institution of the\nstate administration and has, among others, the following\nresponsibilities: it proposes laws, the budget of the\nRepublic and other regulations passed by the Assembly, it\ndetermines the policies of execution of laws and other\nregulations of the Assembly and is responsible for their\nexecution, decides on the recognition of states and\ngovernments, establishes diplomatic and consular relations\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\nwith other states, proposes the Public Prosecutor, proposes\nthe appointment of ambassadors and representatives of the\nRepublic of Macedonia abroad and appoints chiefs of\nconsular offices, and also performs other duties stipulated\nby the Constitution and law.\nIn Macedonia there are more political parties participating\nin the electoral process at national and local level.\n\n5.2. Current Structure\nParties of traditional left and right:\nCoalition VMRO \u2013 DPMNE (63 mandates, right oriented\nMacedonian party)\nDemocratic Party of the Albanians (12 mandates, right\noriented Albanian party)\nCoalition \"SONCE\" \u2013 SDSM (27 mandates left oriented\nMacedonian party)\nDemocratic Union for Integration (18 mandates left\noriented Albanian party)\n\nFig. 1 Current political structure in Republic of Macedonia and Political\nParties mandate percentage win in latest parliamentary elections.\n\n6. Political party web sites and use of social\nmedia\nParty websites represent an application of a technology\nwhich has led those dealing in votes to invest considerable\namounts of time and money. This part presents a survey of\nthe websites of Macedonian political parties. It examines\nthe individual parties on the web and the party system on\nthe web as virtual counterparts of the ordinary parties and\nparty system.\nBecause of the importance of applying information and\ncommunication technologies (ICT) in the work of central\nand local government and in terms of facilitating the life\nand work of citizens, as well as the major role in the\ndevelopment of information society in EU integration\nprocess, an analysis has been conducted on websites and\nsocial media usage by political parties in Macedonia.\nThe research includes analysis of websites, analysis of the\nuse of social media and online activities compared in terms\nof seats obtained by political parties.\n\n156\n\nIn account were taken only websites of the major political\nparties that can certainly be determined to be guided by\ntheir info centers.\nIn order to level the differences between the parties and a\ncommon base for comparison, two indexes were created:\nInternal platform which are the party's official website and\nExternal platforms which are websites that defined as\nsocial media platforms.\nWhile reviewing the websites I have searched for features\nthat can be considered as social media features and that\nwere incorporated in parties' websites.\nContrary to traditional content analysis where texts are the\nsubject of a thorough analysis, here a content analysis was\nmade, but on a more general level of website sections and\nless on their content.\nPlatforms that are not owned by the parties and considered\nas social media platforms. On these platforms the party has\nan official profile/user that is uploading the content and\nhas the permissions to monitor moderate the other users'\nactivity.\nThe results had showed that the relatively popular parties,\nThe VMRO-DMPNE, Social Democrats, DPA, DUI and\nND had been using more social media features and\nplatforms than the other parliament parties.\nDespite these findings there are no clear signs of an\nestablished use of social media as a political\ncommunication strategy. There is not enough correlation\nbetween number of parliament members and website's\nusers. Some of major parties are the worst in translating\nvoters into website's users.\n\nFig. 2 Represents Traffic rate and mandates by relatively popular parties\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\n157\n\n6.1. Purpose of research\n\n6.1.3. Methodology\n\nDue to the increased use of Internet in Macedonia and the\nincreased influence of the same as medium, research has\nbeen conducted to determine how political parties use the\ninfluence of Internet.\nThe study aims to evaluate several levels of Internet usage\nand social networks in everyday political events:\n\nTo implement this part of the research content analysis\nmethodology was used. Drawing up the list of web sites\nthat will be use, their analysis is processed by strictly\ndefined form, with concrete questions and directions.\n\n\uf0d8\n\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nTo determine the level of quality and\nimplementation of the standards of the political\nparties websites\nTo determine the level of use of social media for\ntheir promotion\nTo determine the level of online communication\nof political parties with public\nTo compare the number of online supporters with\nconquered mandate of the last elections.\n\nThe form consists of three main issues, which contain\nadditional questions about obtaining the necessary\ninformation and conclusions.\nThe main issues are:\n\uf0d8\n\nIn which language versions websites are\naccessible\n\uf0d8 What type of content is offered by websites\n\uf0d8 What kind of social media are used by political\nparty\n\n6.2. Language version\nOne area of running a political campaign is Internet, and\nalso the use of social media. The analysis will include\ninternal platform which are the party's official website\ntheir social content and does this web pages have links to\nthe external platforms which are websites that defined as\nsocial media platforms. Also, the technical characteristics\nof the sites.\n\nThe websites analysis will include Web sites of relatively\npopular political parties in Macedonia. From 19 political\nparties, only 13 (70%) have their own web sites for\npromotion and marketing of their political activity. From\nanalyzed Web sites , only 4 offer bilingual accessibility\n(30%), and others offer information only in the language\nof own ethnicity (unilingual content).\n\n6.1.1. Research questions and hypotheses\nThe analysis of political parties' websites is based on\nclearly defined issues that are divided into several\ncategories, in order to evaluate every aspect of the content\nand making the website of the political party.\nQuestionnaire for this section is designed to address the\nfollowing main questions:\n\nTable 1: Language Versions\n\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nIn what languages website is available\nWhat type of content is offered on website (text,\nmultimedia, transparency ...)\n\uf0d8 Applying the standard for usability of website\n\uf0d8 Usage of Social Media\n\n6.1.2. Limits\nIn conducting the research and when creating the list of\npolitical parties whose Web sites will be analyzed, there\nwere taken in consideration only those whose identity\ncould be confirmed. It means that it is evident that website\nis managed by the political party.\n\nFig. 3 Language versions\n\nAs I mentioned above from analyzed websites, only 4\noffer bilingual accessibility (30%), and nine other political\nparties (70%) offer only unilingual content.\n\nTable 2: Multilanguage Usage\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\n158\n\nfuture activities and events. Most political parties use their\nwebsites to archive articles from the media, rather than\nused to inform their supporters.\n\nFig. 4 Multilanguage Usage\n\n6.3. Offered content\n\nFig.5 Textual content of all political party web sites\n\nThe second area for which websites analysis was\nperformed is content offered by political party websites to\ntheir readers. The type of content is divided into text and\nmultimedia.\n\nFig. 6 Multimedia content of all political party web sites\n\nTable 3-1: Content offered by political parties websites\n\nFrequently political parties put banners to external\nWebPages, and not applying the concept of linking in the\ntext. Although most of the texts offered by political parties\nat their web sites are excerpts from articles in the media,\nalthough they cite the source from where the content is\ndownloaded, they not publish the link to the original\narticle, not even the online edition of the medium.\nBesides textual content almost all political parties are\noffering and multimedia content. Most of political parties\nhave placed videos of nearly any report or television\ninterview. Besides the video clips, several political parties\noffer galleries of their activities. Only audio clips are\nmissing from multimedia content on political party\nwebsites. Only three political parties have offered this type\nof content, and they have offered several songs (hymns of\nthe party) for download, but they were not taken into\naccount.\n\nTable 3-2: Content offered by political parties' websites\n\nThe results of this part of the research shows that most of\nthe websites of political parties are filled with textual\ncontent, but that the textual content is not linked to the\noutside source (Out Links) 31% of websites, while\nregarding the multimedia content nearly 46% of the\nwebsites of political parties have no photo gallery, 77% of\nwebsites of political parties have no audio clips and 38%\nof websites have no video clips. Also a lack in all the\nwebsites of political parties is informing the guests for\n\nFig.7 Textual content of each political party websites\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\n159\n\nparties do not take care of attendance (visitors) of their\nwebsites.\n\nFig.8 Multimedia content of each political party website.\n\nBesides the types of content (text and multimedia) in this\npart of the analysis were explored also the ways of\ncommunication which are offered by political parties\nthrough their websites.\n\nFig.9 Opportunities for contact / interaction / transparency offered by\neach political party in Macedonia\n\nSurprising fact that political parties do not use their sites\nfor the opportunity to communicate and besides the\npossibility of sending e-mails almost there is no other\npossible way to contact them, except a very small number\nof political parties which offers email and other contact\ninformation as phone number, address and the like.\nVery few political parties have set forum on their website,\nalso very small number of political parties offers an\nopportunity for asking questions and publishing answers\nonline.\n\nFig.10 Opportunities for contact / interaction / transparency offered by all\npolitical party in Macedonia by category\n\nTable 4: Ways of communication offered by political parties\n\nTable shows that in terms of interaction, political parties\nare not handled and did not use the opportunities of new\nmedia field. Besides basic information such as postal\naddress, phone and email address, no other method is used.\nSites of some political parties have disabled the\nopportunity to contact them via e-mail or form, but they\noffer only the traditional ways of communication\n(telephone and letter).\nFor transparency of the website is necessary to enable\nseeing the number of visitors on the site, which was also\nleft out of more websites of the political parties. A very\nsmall part of the political parties had included counters on\ntheir websites, whether public or just used by the\nadministrators of the website. This means that political\n\nTable 5: Visitors Counter on political web pages\n\nFrom the table we can conclude that almost 92% of\npolitical parties have no counters on their websites, as a\nconsequence of lack of counters we cannot say with\ncertainty about the attendance (visitors) of website of\ncertain political parties.\nAlmost all political parties have used CMS (Content\nManagement System) for making their websites, so they\nmeet the basic rules for usability of the website. However\nastonishing fact that despite meeting the technical\nspecifications for usability, they have errors that are not\ninherent for the platforms that are used, for example the\nsearch box which does not work properly and the like.

Technical Specifications of political\nparties' websites\nThis part of research covers the technical characteristics of\nthe websites of political parties, respectively hosting and\nplatform on which websites are set up and registration of\nthe domain are shown in the table below.\n\nFig.12 Platforms used by political parties' websites in Macedonia\n\nTable 8: Servers used by political parties' websites in Macedonia\n\nTable 6: Technical Specifications of political parties web sites\n\nIf we do comparison of software solutions which is more\nused we can conclude that 69% of political parties\nwebsites use the PHP programming language, 23% use\nASP programming language and only 8% use ASPX\nprogramming language. Platforms that are used by\npolitical parties websites are 23% Windows Server 2003,\n23% of them use Windows 2000 platform and 54% were\nUnknown platforms.\n\nFig.13 Servers used by political parties' websites in Macedonia\n\nMost of political parties websites are hosted in Macedonia\n46% of the total number of political Web sites, 38% of\nthem are hosted in the US, 8% are hosted in France and\n8% are hosted in the Netherland.\n\nTable 7: Software solutions and platforms used by political parties\nwebsites\n\nFig.14 Hosted in Countries\n\nMost of the websites of political parties are registered in\nthe Republic of Macedonia 63%, while 31% are registered\nin the United States and 7% are registered in France.\n\nFig.11 Software solution used by political parties' websites in Macedonia\n\nTable 9: Registered in countries\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\n161\n\nFig.15 Registered in countries\n\nAccording the table in which the technical characteristics\nof the websites of political parties are presented, we can\nsee that political parties have used free solutions. While\nthe information for domains show that websites of political\nparties often are registered and hosted in Macedonia, but\nthere are a few exceptions, some political parties have\ntheir sites hosted in the U.S., but again Macedonia is\ndominant in terms of domain registration. Here it is\nimportant to mention that those domains that are not\nregistered in Macedonia have no extension. mk.\n\nFig.16 Usage of social media by each political party\n\n6.5. Profiles on social media websites\nRecently, many popular are accounts of political parties\nand politicians on social media, so precisely because they\nwere included in this study. According to this fact i have\ncollected information which politicians (party presidents)\nhave their official account on social media (social\nnetworking sites) and the political parties use these social\nmedia to communicate with electors.\n\nFig.17 Usage of social media by each president of political parties\n\nFig.18 Usage of social media by all political parties\n\nFig.19 Usage of social media by all presidents of political parties\nTable 10: Usage of social media by each political party and its leader\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\nFig.20 Usage of social media by all political parties VS all party\npresidents\n\nAccording to the results, they show that despite the\npopularity of social media (SNS), political parties and\npoliticians (presidents of the parties) have not used fully\nthe advantages and opportunities of these tools to connect\nwith their supporters. Most popular services are Facebook\nand YouTube, while platforms for sharing images were\nused rarely. Some political parties had implemented photo\ngalleries on their sites.\n\n7. Conclusion\nThe Internet first became a significant political tool in\noffering one-way communication for political parties with\nthe development of political parties' websites. However,\npolitics online is no longer as valued for its one-way\ncommunication but is now praised, and used for the\nopportunities it provides to conduct two way\ncommunications between political parties, their\ncampaigns, and potential voters.\nIn today's political arena, websites and Internet resources,\nsuch as weblogs, social networks, podcasts and compatible\nvideo formats are being shared as a means of consuming\nand disseminating information via the web. As a result,\nwebsites are becoming a major if not the number one\nresource for political campaigns to contact supporters,\nvolunteers, and donations. At the same time, for the\nconsumer, or, in this case, the voter, the Internet has\nbecome a primary resource for campaign media explored\nvia web blogging, campaign websites, news sites, social\nnetworks, video sharing and podcasts. While traditional\nwebsites are still offering significant value to the political\nworld, technology is pushing the envelope steps further\nwith the use of web blogging, the development of social\nnetworks, the availability of podcasts (news and opinion\nrelated), and video sharing through sites such as YouTube,\nwhich provide the general public with video clips (of up to\n5+ minutes in length). Thus the issue is no longer whether\npolitics is online but, instead, in what form and with what\nconsequences.\n\n162\n\nPolitics on the Internet has expanded beyond static twodimensional web pages that used to serve as online\nbillboards, flyers for a candidates position, and the\ntraditional barriers of physical organizing. This has\nushered in a new era of online consumer media and\nnetworking content that is saturated by political and\ncampaign content. Furthermore, the phenomena of\ncampaigns and the Internet is becoming less about what is\nfeatured on the campaign website, and instead consists\nmore of user generated and user spread content that\ncirculates virally on the Internet, connecting supporters\nfrom across the globe.\nSo far, Web 2.0 has had a weak e-ruptive effect on\nMacedonian party politics. On the horizontal dimension,\nthe parties' share of activities on Web 2.0 has mainly\nfollowed what could be expected from their share of votes\nin 2008 parliamentary election. But deviations from the\npattern indicate there are variable priorities, meaning that\ngiven a minimum of resource, parties and activists can\ndecide to be \"big in Web 2.0 politics\" or decide not to.\nRegarding the vertical dimension of e-ruption, it appears\nthat the national party organizations has gained more\ncontrol and initiative in 2009 presidential an municipality\nelection, the more anarchical situation of 2008 being\ntemporary, due to sudden introduction of new\ntechnologies. Furthermore, while the number of users,\nviewers, members, followers and bloggers may have\ndoubled since 2008, the party political Web 2.0 segment is\nstill very small. This is both as a segment on Web 2.0 and\nas segment of voters in general.\nTherefore the Web 1.5 hypothesis appears to give the best\ndescription. Furthermore, a likely next step is an even\nmore integrated and proactive strategy, as indicated by\nproviding guidance and cues on the party web sites, as\nwell as setting up party specific networks or \"zones\" on\nplaces like Facebook. Success stories of internet politics,\nand especially Obama, have had a significant impact on\nMacedonian media. Comments like the one quoted below\nis quite common:\n\"Macedonian politicians have a lot to learn from Obama\nand his staff when it comes to running electoral\ncampaigns. In particular, they should notice his priority of\ndigital media, a part of the campaign which can be run\nwithout especially high costs.\"\nParty strategists have also been inspired by the American\nexperience. However, to get Macedonian voters drawn into\nWeb politics in sufficient numbers in the first place, a\nmore systemic approach is called for. During the American\npresidential campaign common \"entrances\" or \"portals\" to\nparty politics on the main Web 2.0 sites were set up on\nestablished sites as on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\n\fIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May 2011\nISSN (Online): 1694-0814\nwww.IJCSI.org\n\nSome differences between the American and Macedonian\nparty systems should also be noted. A national party in the\nUSA and Macedonia is quite simply different entities.\nPopulation- and territorial size, as well as diversity, place\ndifferent demands on local networking and autonomy, as\nwell as effective coordination and communication between\nthe localities. American parties also have a much looser\nstructure, with relatively few members and dormant local\nbranches. Macedonian parties on the other hand are still\nare relatively strong organizations and less reliant on ad\nhoc networking. Thirdly, American elections are\ncandidate-centered, in contrast to the party centered\napproach found in Macedonia. These differences may be\nreduced over time, as Macedonia \u2013 along with other\nEuropean countries \u2013 is approaching a model with\ndecoupled local branches, fewer members and more focus\non individual leaders. But they are still significant enough\nto warrant the question whether Web 2.0 is more\nfunctional for American parties and therefore more\n\"rational\" to use for winning elections, exactly because\nthese parties are more like network parties in the first\nplace.\nAs such, it may therefore seem like a paradox that it is the\nSDSM and VMRO-DPMNE which have most fully\nembraced Web 2.0. They are one of the oldest parties and\nprobably still have the most effective and vital party\norganization. However, this also means that the party has\nthe resources and structure to effectively implement their\nWeb 2.0 presence, provided the party leadership thinks it\nnecessary. It is another useful media channel for\ncommunicating with members and voters.\nThe Internet is a unique forum for politics as it provides\nback and forth communication and allows for an exchange\nof information between users and sources. The Internet\nalso offers its users greater access to information and the\nability to express themselves in various online political\narenas. In addition, individuals use the Internet as a tool to\nfind and join groups that share their similar ideological,\ncultural, political and lifestyle preferences.\n\n8.
