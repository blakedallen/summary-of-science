The discovery reach of hadron machines, however, may not be very\nhigh for particles that carry only weak charges. Typically these particles are produced\nthrough the Drell-Yan mechanism or through cascade decays. At the LHC the former\nmechanism suffers from being quark-initiated instead than gluon-initiated. The latter is,\nin general, penalized at both machines by the fact that the energy of the decaying particle\nmay be substantially reduced with respect to that of the initial beam. The discovery\nreach for sleptons, for example, is only <\n\u223c 350 GeV at the LHC [4]. Nevertheless, a\nsufficient production cross section may be achieved through the enhancement of some\nlarge parameter, or if an alternative production mechanism is possible.\nIn the case of the charged Higgs there are two such large parameters: yt and tan \u03b2.\nThe alternative mechanism is the Higgs strahlung, i.e. the production in association with\na t- and a b-quark [5, 6, 7, 8], or in association with a t-quark only [9, 6, 8]. The former\n\n\fpossibility is described by the elementary 2 \u2192 3 processes gg, qq \u2192 tH \u2212 b\u0304, the latter,\nby the 2 \u2192 2 process gb \u2192 tH \u2212 . Both types of elementary processes are discussed in\nSection 2. Predictions for the production cross sections are also given, in the case in which\nthe subsequent decay of the charged Higgs gives rise to an overall multi-b's topology, as\nwell as in the case in which at most two b-quarks are present in the final state. In the first\ncase, the need of minimizing the number of b-quarks to be tagged requires the combination\nof the 2 \u2192 3 and the 2 \u2192 2 cross sections.\nThe discovery of a charged Higgs boson will imply the existence of a second Higgs\ndoublet and, possibly, of a supersymmetric underlying structure of the world [10]. Charged\nHiggs bosons give potentially large contributions to flavour-changing-neutral-current processes. Indeed, there are quite strong constraints on their mass coming from these processes, in particular b \u2192 s\u03b3 [11]. The constraint is even stronger in a non-supersymmetric\n2 Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) [12], since it is not plagued by the model dependence\nthat it has in supersymmetric models. However, it was shown that, even in this case, this\nbound can be evaded if the 2HDM is the remnant of a multiHiggs doublet model, with\nall doublets, except two, very heavy [13]. The cross section for the strahlung production\nmechanism, as well as the branching ratios for the decays of the resulting charged Higgs\nare, in such a model, the same as in the 2HDM. Therefore, it is reasonable to keep separated limits from virtual effects and limits from direct production (as indeed it was/is\nalready assumed in direct searches at LEP and at the Tevatron). They are complementary\nand they possibly reinforce each other. We assume only the current limits on the charged\nHiggs bosons mass coming from LEP (\u2243 78.6 GeV) and the Tevatron (\u223c 160 GeV) (see\nfor example [14]), although these limits were challenged as model dependent [15].\nFrom charged-Higgs strahlung, the step to slepton strahlung in Rp -violating models [16, 17] is quite small. If Rp is violated, or more properly, if the lepton number L\nis violated, the charged Higgs has all the quantum numbers of a charged slepton, say \u03c4\u0303 .\nThis can then be singly produced in association with a t- and a b-quark, or only a t-quark,\nexactly like the charged Higgs. (Note that the single production of charged sleptons is impossible if Rp is conserved.) The corresponding cross section can be obtained generalizing\nthe calculation for the associated production of the charged Higgs. The role of yb * tan \u03b2\nis plaid in this case by the L-violating parameter \u03bb\u2032333 , but there is no counterpart for the\nparameter yt . The yield of \u03c4\u0303 's turns out to be considerable even for modest values of \u03bb\u2032333 .\nThe same production mechanism holds also for first and second generation sleptons,\n\u03bc\u0303 and \u1ebd. The corresponding cross sections are in these cases proportional to the square of\n\u03bb\u2032233 and \u03bb\u2032133 . As in the case of the charged Higgs, the identification of all decay modes\nfor these singly produced sleptons is very important in that it may affect the way the\nproduction cross section must be calculated. These issues are discussed in Section 3. One\nof the slepton decay modes, induced by the same L-violating coupling \u03bb\u2032i33 responsible\nfor its production, bt\u0304, is exactly one of the decay modes of the charged Higgs. For this\ndecay mode the combination of the 2 \u2192 3 and 2 \u2192 2 elementary processes is mandatory.\nThe other decay modes of the charged slepton are into a charged lepton and the lightest\nneutralino, l\u0303\u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03c7\u030301 , or into a neutral lepton and the lightest chargino, l\u0303\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdl \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 . The\nrelevance for slepton production of other Rp -violating couplings involving at least one third\n2\n\n\fgeneration index, such as \u03bb\u2032i3j and \u03bb\u2032ij3 is also discussed. Moreover, it is emphasized that\nthe simultaneous presence of couplings of type \u03bb\u2032i33 and of type \u03bbi33 may have important\nconsequences for charged Higgs searches.\nIt is therefore crucial to know whether among the final states obtained after the\ndecays of \u03c7\u030301 and \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 , there are any distinguishable from those obtained from charged\nHiggs decays. A discussion of the 3-body decays of \u03c7\u030301 and \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 , due to the Rp -violating\ncoupling \u03bb\u2032i33 , \u03bb\u2032332 , and \u03bb\u2032323 , is found in Section 4. It follows closely Refs. [18, 19] and\nit is rather general, i.e. valid for any kinematical region for the lightest neutralino and\nchargino, and independent of the assumption on gaugino mass unification at some large\nscale. Some guidelines on the distinguishability of a charged slepton from a charged Higgs\nboson, both produced via strahlung from a quark line, are given in Section 3.\nIn the same spirit as in the discussion on charged Higgs boson strahlung, also in\nthe case of slepton strahlung and neutralino/chargino decays, no constraints from virtual\neffects are included in this analysis. As before, the rational is that these constraints can,\nin general, be evaded by some (more or less) specific choices of the different parameters\ncontributing to these effects. An exception is made for neutrino physics in Section 5. The\nsmallness of their masses, makes in general neutrino spectra very sensitive to all L-number\nviolating couplings. We review in Section 5 the main contributions to neutrino masses in\nRp -violating models, at the tree level, at the one- and at the two-loop level. The latter ones\nwere recently analyzed in Ref. [20]. In general, imposing that Rp -violating couplings are\ncompatible with neutrino physics jeopardizes the visibility of some of the collider signals\ndiscussed here. Moreover, the constraints from the two-loop contributions, if those from\nthe tree- and one-loop level are evaded, may affect also searches for single sneutrino \u03bd\u0303\nproduction [6, 21, 22] as well as the decay \u03bd\u0303 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. We discuss how these constraints can\nstill be evaded if, for example, Rp -violating couplings have nontrivial phases. We single\nout the Rp -violating parameters that remain unsuppressed after imposing constraints from\nneutrino physics and the relevance that they may have not only for slepton searches, but\nfor Higgs searches as well. In any case, it is clear that an independent collider probe of\nthe lepton structure of these couplings may become a precious tool for model building, in\nthat it may help individuating the real mechanism of generation of neutrino masses.\nFinally, we comment on the possibility of having very tiny violation of the lepton\nnumber L. In general, it is assumed that this would affect only the phenomenology of\nthe lightest neutralino and possibly neutrino physics. We conclude our discussion in\nSection 5, by pointing out that in models in which \u03c7\u030301 and \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 are nearly degenerate, such\nsmall violation of Rp would have dramatic consequences also for the phenomenology of\nthe lightest chargino.\n\n2\n\nCharged Higgs strahlung\n\nCharged Higgs strahlung is induced by the 2 \u2192 3 elementary processes gg, q q\u0304 \u2192 tH \u2212 b\u0304,\nwhich get contributions from the Feynman diagrams in Figs. 1 and 2.

It was\nshown, however, that in the region mt \u223c mH \u00b1 + mb , this description fails to account for\nthe correct mechanism of production and decay of the charged Higgs boson [23].\n\nt\nb\n\nb\n\nH\u2212\n\nFigure 3: Charged Higgs strahlung from the 2 \u2192 2 elementary process.\nThe 2 \u2192 2 process gb \u2192 tH \u2212 giving also rise to strahlung of charged Higgs bosons\nhas Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 3.

Note that, since the initial b-quark is contained\nin the proton or antiproton via a gluon, the 2 \u2192 2 process is actually of the same order\nin \u03b1s as the 2 \u2192 3 ones.\nWhen the decay of the charged Higgs does not give rise to third-generation quarks,\nthe two production mechanisms are clearly independent. They require the reconstruction\nof two b-quarks, in the case of the 2 \u2192 3 processes, or of only one, in the case of the\n2 \u2192 2 process. This is the case of the channel H \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 , suitable for the discovery\nof the charged Higgs in the region of large tan \u03b2, and possibly bound to play a key-role\nalso in the region of intermediate tan \u03b2 since it is not plagued by QCD background as the\nH \u2212 \u2192 bt\u0304 mode [14]. The two production mechanisms can be experimentally distinguished\nand studied separately.\nLeading-order predictions for the two production cross sections are given in Fig. 4\nfor the Tevatron and LHC energies as a function of the charged-Higgs mass for three\ndifferent values of tan \u03b2, tan \u03b2 = 2, 10, and 50. The cross sections \u03c3(pp\u0304, pp \u2192 tH \u2212 b\u0304X)\nare shown by the solid lines, those for \u03c3(pp\u0304, pp \u2192 tH \u2212 X) by dashed lines. The leadingorder parton distribution functions CTEQ4L [24] are used, and the renormalization (\u03bcR )\nand factorization (\u03bcf ) scales are fixed to the threshold value mt + mH \u00b1 . A variation of\nthese scales in the interval between (mt +mH \u00b1 )/2 and 2(mt +mH \u00b1 ) results in changes up to\n5\n\n\f\u221a\ns = 2 and 14 TeV, for tan\u03b2 =\n2, 10, 50. The solid lines indicate the cross sections due to the 2 \u2192 3 processes; the dashed\nlines, those due to the 2 \u2192 2 process. Renormalization and factorization scales are fixed as\n\u03bcR = \u03bcf = mt + mH \u2212 . From Ref. [6].\n\nFigure 4: Cross section \u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 t(b\u0304)H \u2212 X) versus mH \u2212 , for\n\n\u00b130% in both cross sections. QCD corrections, therefore, may be important, as was shown\nin the case of associate production of the neutral Higgs [25], but they are unfortunately\nnot yet available. Part of these corrections is captured by the QCD correction to the bquark mass from which these cross sections depend. A study of their variation for different\nvalues of the b-quark mass can be found in Ref. [26].\nAs expected, the production cross section due to the 2 \u2192 3 processes is enhanced in\nthe resonance region mH \u00b1 < mt \u2212 mb , when H \u00b1 is obtained as a decay product of one\nof the two t-quarks produced on shell. The resonant t-quark propagator is regularized by\nthe width of the t-quark, calculated from the SM decay t \u2192 bW + and from the decay\nt \u2192 H + b. Away from the resonance region, the cross section diminishes rather rapidly\nand becomes negligible at the Tevatron\n\u221a energy. In this region, the relative size of the\ntwo classes of cross section depends on s and mH \u00b1 . Indeed, at high energies, where the\ngluon-initiated 2 \u2192 3 processes dominate over the quark-initiated ones, the cross section\narising from the elementary process gb \u2192 tH \u2212 is larger than that from gg \u2192 tH \u2212 b, which\nis penalized by a 3-body phase space suppression. At the Tevatron center-of-mass energy,\nthe quark-initiated 2 \u2192 3 processes still have the dominant role up to intermediate values\nof mH \u00b1 . For the particular choice of scales \u03bcR and \u03bcf made here, the cross-over for the\ntwo cross sections is at about mH \u00b1 \u223c 265 GeV. Both classes of cross sections show the\ntypical behaviour as a function of tan \u03b2, with a minimum at around (mt /mb )1/2 .\nWhen the charged Higgs, decaying, gives rise to at least two b-quarks, the final state\nto be identified contains at least three b's for the 2 \u2192 2 production mechanism, and at\nleast four for the 2 \u2192 3 one. This is the case of the decay channel H + \u2192 tb\u0304, particularly\nimportant in the region of small tan \u03b2, when the rate for H \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 vanishes. Since\ntagging more than three b's seems quite difficult even at the LHC (see, however, Ref. [27]),\nthe two production mechanisms result into final states that are indistinguishable and a\nsum of the two cross sections is necessary. As shown in Fig. 5, the kinematical region in\n6\n\n\ft\n\nH\u2212\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nH\u2212\n\nb\nb\nFigure 5: Term of the gluon-initiated 2 \u2192 3 process overlapping with a contribution from the\n2 \u2192 2 one.\n\nwhich one of the two initial gluons in the 2 \u2192 3 processes produces a pair bb\u0304 collinear\nto the initial p or p\u0304, is, by definition, also kept into account by the 2 \u2192 2 process with\nthe initial b-quark collinear to the colliding p or p\u0304, in which it is contained via a gluon.\nA large factor \u03b1s (\u03bcR ) log(\u03bcf /mb ) (\u03bcf is O(mH \u00b1 )), is induced in this kinematical region\nin the cross section from the 2 \u2192 3 processes. This same factor is contained in the cross\nsection from the 2 \u2192 2 process and it is resummed to all orders, (\u03b1s (\u03bcR ) log(\u03bcf /mb ))n ,\nwhen making use of the phenomenological b-distribution function. The first order, n = 1,\nmust then be subtracted from the sum of the two cross sections [6].\n\nFigure 6: The cross section \u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 tH \u2212 X) obtained by adding the contributions from the\n\n2 \u2192 2 and 2 \u2192 3 processes shown in Fig. 4, and subtracting overlapping terms. From Ref. [6].\n\nPredictions for the appropriately summed inclusive cross section are shown in Fig. 6,\nboth for the Tevatron and the LHC. These cross sections have the same theoretical uncertainty of the individual cross sections of Fig. 4, as well as the same tan \u03b2 dependence.\nOnce again, the inclusion of QCD corrections is awaited for. (The dependence of these\ncross sections on the value of mb , which may be most strongly affected by QCD corrections, is shown in Ref. [26].) Similarly, at least in the region of large tan \u03b2, supersymmetric\ncorrections should be nonnegligible. These have been calculated for the 2 \u2192 3 processes,\nsee [28] and references therein. Recently also a calculation of the gluino corrections for\nthe 2 \u2192 2 process [29] had appeared, but no complete estimate exists, as yet, for the\nsummed cross sections.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nCharged slepton strahlung\n\nAs the charged Higgs boson, a charged slepton can be radiated from a t-quark thanks to\nthe couplings \u03bb\u2032i3j in the superpotential\n1\nW \u2283 \u2212\u03bb\u2032lmn Ll Qm Dnc \u2212 \u03bblmn Ll Lm Enc ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere, for completeness also the operators with couplings \u03bblmn are shown. In particular,\nfor the coupling \u03bb\u2032333 , both the 2 \u2192 3 partonic processes, q q\u0304, gg \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4\u0303 and the 2 \u2192 2\nprocess gb \u2192 t\u03c4\u0303 contribute to the strahlung of a \u03c4\u0303 -slepton. The corresponding Feynman\ndiagrams are obtained from those in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 by replacing H \u2212 with \u03c4\u0303 . The\ninclusive cross section induced by the 2 \u2192 3 processes is that of Eq. (1) with the square\namplitudes |M|2gg and |M|2qq\u0304 given by:\n1 \u2032 2\n|\u03bb333 | (4\u03c0\u03b1S )2 |Vtb |2 (V qq\u0304 + Aqq\u0304 )\n4\n1 \u2032 2\n=\n|\u03bb333 | (4\u03c0\u03b1S )2 |Vtb |2 (V gg + Agg ) ,\n4\n\n|M|2qq\u0304 =\n|M|2gg\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the values v = a = 1/2 were already substituted in. The reduced square amplitudes V qq\u0304 , Aqq\u0304 and V gg , Agg coincide with those obtained for the 2 \u2192 3 charged-Higgsproduction processes, once the replacement mH \u00b1 \u2192 m\u03c4\u0303 is made. The partonic cross\nsection for gb \u2192 t\u03c4\u0303 can also be obtained from\nHiggs production, with\n\u221a that for\u2032 charged\n2\n2\nobvious changes, i.e. by replacing 4GF MW / 2 with |\u03bb333 | and mH \u2212 with m\u03c4\u0303 .\n\nFigure 7: Same as in Fig. 6, for \u03c4\u0303 production, when the coupling \u03bb\u2032333 is dominant among all\nother Rp -violating couplings. The production cross section is shown for different values of \u03bb\u2032333 .\nFrom Ref. [6].\n\nThe same coupling \u03bb\u2032333 inducing the radiation of the charged slepton from a third\ngeneration quark line, is also responsible for the decay \u03c4\u0303 \u2192 bt\u0304. In this case, the charged\nslepton behaves exactly like a charged Higgs decaying into the same final state, and has\nonly the effect of increasing the number of tt\u0304bb\u0304 events from 2 \u2192 3 processes, or of tt\u0304b\n8\n\n\fevents from the 2 \u2192 2 one. In this case, the evaluation of the slepton production cross\nsection requires the combination of the 2 \u2192 3 and the 2 \u2192 2 cross sections, as outlined in\nSection 2. Predictions for this cross section are shown in Fig. 7 for the Tevatron and the\nLHC, where in the kinematical region of a resonant t-quark, only the two decay modes\nt \u2192 W + b and t \u2192 \u03c4\u0303 + b are considered. It is assumed that the charged Higgs H \u00b1 is\nsufficiently heavy, as to kinematically forbid the decay mode t \u2192 H + b.\n\u221a\nThe large cross section obtained in the case of s = 14 TeV implies that at the LHC,\nwith a luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 per year, light \u03c4\u0303 's may be produced in abundance even for\ncouplings as small as 0.01. Charged sleptons are, therefore, potentially more accessible\n(for not too small values of \u03bb\u2032333 ) than in models with lepton-number conservation, where\ntheir direct production relies on the Drell\u2013Yan process. As it is known, this allows a\ndiscovery reach for sleptons only up to ml\u0303 <\n\u223c 350 GeV at the LHC [4]. Cascade decays\nmay provide the bulk of slepton production in the lepton-number-conserving models, but\nsuch processes are highly model-dependent. They also complement slepton production\nin the lepton-number-violating case studied here. The potential reach at the Tevatron\nis limited to large couplings and/or light \u03c4\u0303 's, i.e. to \u03c4\u0303 lighter than the t-quark [30].\nIn the resonant part of the curves, where the cross section can be approximated by the\nproduction cross section of a pair of t-quarks times the branching ratio for the decay of one\nof the two t's, the direct decay t \u2192 \u03c4\u0303 + b can significantly constrain the values of \u03bb\u2032333 [31].\nFor m\u03c4\u0303 = 70 GeV, only values up to \u223c 0.2 will remain allowed, if charged slepton searches\nhave a negative outcome at Run II with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\u22121 \u2217 .\nBesides the decay \u03c4\u0303 \u2192 t\u0304b, two additional 2-body decays, due to gauge interactions,\nare possible for \u03c4\u0303 : \u03c4\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7\u03030 \u03c4 \u2212 and \u03c4\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 . Whether the 2 \u2192 3 processes and the 2 \u2192 2\none must be combined also in this case, depends on the final states produced by the decays\nof charginos and neutralinos. A list of all the final states produced by the couplings \u03bb\u2032i33\nand \u03bbi33 can be found in Table 1, in which also the final states obtained from charged\nHiggs decays are listed. In first approximation, let us assume that the coupling \u03bb\u2032333 is\ndominant among all Rp -violating couplings. In such a case, the lightest neutralino decays\nas (see Section 4):\n\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 ,\n\n\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 ,\n\n\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 t\u0304b\u03c4 + ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith the second and third decay mode allowed only for a heavy \u03c7\u030301 , i.e. for m\u03c7\u030301 >\nmt + mb + m\u03c4 . The 2-body decays due to tree-level mixing of Higgs\u2013slepton, \u03c7\u0303\u2212 \u2013\u03c4 \u2212 , and\n\u03c7\u03030 \u2013\u03bd\u03c4 are neglected here. They become competitive with the 3-body decays only when\nthe values of the trilinear couplings are rather small, and therefore no slepton strahlung\nsignal is expected. For a discussion of the decays due to these mixings, see for example\nRef. [34]. In the same approximation, the lightest chargino decays via gauge interactions\nas:\n\u2212 0\n\u03c7\u0303\u2212\n(8)\n1 \u2192 W \u03c7\u03031 .\nThe Rp -violating chargino decays,\n\u2217\n\n\u2212\n\u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03c4 ,\n\n\u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u2192 bt\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 ,\n\n\u03bd\u03c4 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1,\n\n\u2212\n\u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u2192 tt\u0304\u03c4 ,\n\nThe analysis of Ref.

The possible final states that can be produced through these decays\ncontain all at least 3 b's.

When the two\nt's decay hadronically, the resulting signature is that of two equal-sign leptons, jets and\nno missing energy. Note that the two equal-sign leptons may be two \u03bc's if the coupling\n\u03bb\u2032233 is the one considered. In this case, the strahlung-produced sleptons are \u03bc\u0303's. The\nproduction cross sections shown in Fig. 7 apply also to this case, when \u03bb\u2032333 is substituted\nby \u03bb\u2032233 and m\u03c4\u0303 by m\u03bc\u0303 .\nThe couplings \u03bb\u2032i3j give also rise to strahlung of the slepton l\u0303i in association with a\nt- and an s-quark, when j = 2, or in association with a t- and a d-quark when j = 1. At\nthe partonic level these production mechanisms are described by the elementary processes\nq q\u0304, gg \u2192 ts\u0304l\u0303i , gs \u2192 tl\u0303i , and q q\u0304, gg \u2192 td \u0304l\u0303i , gd \u2192 tl\u0303i . Some representative diagrams for the\nstrahlung associated with a t- and an s-quarks are shown in Fig. 8. For these couplings,\nat most 2 b's are present in the final states and they can be easily tagged at the LHC.\nThe 2 \u2192 3 and 2 \u2192 2 processes can therefore be disentangled and studied separately.\nt\ns\n\ns\n\n`~i\n\nt\n\n`~i\ns\n\nFigure 8: Strahlung of a charged slepton associated with a t- and an s-quark.\nNote that the cross sections for the 2 \u2192 3 processes q q\u0304, gg \u2192 ts\u0304l\u0303i , and q q\u0304, gg \u2192 td \u0304l\u0303i\n \u0304 obtained when the\nare as those obtained for q q\u0304, gg \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4\u0303 .

The possibility of distinguishing which coupling has\ninduced the production of l\u0303i , i.e. whether \u03bb\u2032i33 , \u03bb\u2032i32 , or \u03bb\u2032i31 , strongly depends on how\naccurately the final states can be studied.

Also in this case, the final states obtained when j = 1\nor j = 2 are not likely to be induced by charged Higgs bosons and such signals would be\ngenuine Rp -violating ones.\nThere is another rather interesting possibility that opens up for sleptons obtained\nfrom 2 \u2192 2 processes, through the couplings \u03bb\u2032i32 and \u03bb\u2032i31 . If the sleptons l\u0303i produced in\nthis way decay through the couplings \u03bbij3 or \u03bbj3i , the processes\ng d\u0304, gs\u0304 \u2192 tl\u0303i \u2192 t\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bdj\n\n(10)\n\nlead to the same final state obtained from charged Higgs bosons, also originating from\nthe 2 \u2192 2 process g b\u0304 \u2192 tH \u2212 . Given the larger yield of the s- and the d-quark into the\nproton, the slepton production cross section may be much larger than that of the charged\nHiggs and a serious contamination of the charged Higgs signal may be expected even for\nnot too large values of the relevant Rp -violating couplings. Such a possibility should be\nkept in mind when searching for charged Higgs bosons, through the mode \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 . This\nis especially so, when this decay mode is used to extend the region of tan \u03b2 that can be\nprobed to intermediate values such as \u223c 10, for which the Yukawa coupling of the \u03c4 is\nnot particularly large.\nFinally, the coupling \u03bb\u2032ij3 give rise to slepton strahlung in association with a c- and\na b-quark or with a u- and a b-quark, when j = 2 and j = 1. In this case, the strahlung\nmechanism must compete with the 2 \u2192 1 processes, bc\u0304 \u2192 l\u0303i and b\u016b \u2192 l\u0303i , which lead to\nfinal states different from those obtained from the 2 \u2192 2 and 2 \u2192 3 processes. Among\nthese, the states cc\u0304bb\u0304 may substantially add up to those obtained from W -pair production.\nIn addition, final states such as (2c)b\u0304(2li ), with two like-sign leptons, jets and no missing\nenergy can be obtained, in this case, even for light neutralinos, and are distinctive of\nRp -violating couplings.\n\n4\n\nNeutralino and chargino decays\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 3, in Rp -violating scenarios with a dominant coupling\n\u03bb\u2032333 , the lightest neutralino decays as \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , tb\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 , and t\u0304b\u03c4 + . A detailed analysis of\nthese and other decays was performed in Ref. [18], where no assumption was made as to\nwhether the final state is massive or massless, or whether gaugino masses are unified or\nnot at some large scale. As already mentioned in the previous Section, we neglect here the\n2-body decays of the lightest neutralino due to tree-level mixing Higgs\u2013slepton, \u03c7\u0303\u2212 \u2212 \u03c4 ,\nand \u03c7\u03030 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 . For a discussion of these decays and further references on the topic, we refer\nthe reader to Ref. [34].\nThe results may be summarized as follows, when the couplings \u03bb\u2032333 , or \u03bb\u2032332 , and\nare considered. Quite generically, if the lightest neutralino is lighter (or only slightly\nheavier) than the t-quark, it decays predominantly into massless fermions. Depending on\nthe relative size of the Rp -violating couplings, the dominant decays are, e.g, \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 ,\ndue to a dominant \u03bb\u2032333 coupling, and \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 cb\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 , \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 sb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , and their CP-conjugate\n\u03bb\u2032323\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 9: Widths (in GeV) for the four decays \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , tb\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 , bs\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , and cb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 , when only\n\nthe two couplings \u03bb\u2032333 and \u03bb\u2032323 are nonvanishing, as function of the sfermion mass m\u2217 , equal\nto mQ\u0303 = mU \u0303c = mD\u0303c , and to (1.4) \u00d7 mL\u0303 (with mL\u0303 = mE \u0303c ), for \u03bc = 1500 GeV, mB\u0303 = 600 GeV,\nand mW\u0303 = 2mB\u0303 .

When two such couplings are simultaneously present and\nof the same size, the rates for various massless states are of the same order of magnitude\nover a wide range of parameter values, see for example Fig. 9. In this and the following\nFigure, the lightest neutralino decay widths are plotted for values of \u03bb\u2032333 and \u03bb\u2032323 equal\nto 1. Widths for lower values of these couplings are obtained by scaling down those shown\nin these Figures.\nWhen \u03c7\u030301 is substantially heavy, decays with the t-quark in the final state, such as\ntb\u0304\u03c4 , ts\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 , and their CP conjugated states, can become competitive. In general, for\nmoderate/large left-right mixing terms in the sfermions virtually exchanged, and/or of\nsubstantial Bino-Higgsino mixing, these decay modes can be large at not too large values\nof tan \u03b2. Although in general subdominant, their rate can be comparable to those of\nmassless modes, see Figs. 9 and 10.\n\u2212\n\nFurthermore, an overall increase in the total decay width of \u03c7\u030301 is observed, if \u03c7\u030301\nis mainly a Wino, as it may happen if gaugino mass unification is not imposed, or in\nanomaly-mediated supersymmetry-breaking scenarios [32], or in grand-unification models\nwith an additional strong hypercolor group [33].\nIt should be noted here that, if \u03c7\u030301 is lighter than the t-quark, the \u03c7\u030301 decays are not\nsuitable to study the lepton structure of the couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 . In this case, only decays with\nneutrinos in the final states are possible, i.e. \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bdi . The modes in which the charged\nleptons are present, \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 tb\u0304li and \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 t\u0304bl\u0304i , are kinematically forbidden. A study of\nthe lepton structure of these couplings could reveal precious information on the origin of\nneutrino masses (see discussion in Section 5). Unfortunately, independent collider probes\nare restricted to the case of heavy neutralinos. Couplings such as \u03bb\u2032i23 , which are far less\nrelevant for neutrino physics, on the contrary, allow light final states, containing a charged\nlepton, \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 cb\u0304li .\n13\n\n\fFigure 10: \u0393(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd\u03c4 ) and \u0393(\u03c7\u030301 \u2192 tb\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 ) (in GeV), respectively solid and long-dashed lines,\n\nversus m\u2217 = mQ\u0303 = mU \u0303c = mD\u0303c , for \u03bc = 600 GeV, mL\u0303 = mE \u0303c = 600 GeV, mB\u0303 = 600 GeV, and\nmW\u0303 = 2mB\u0303 . The value of tan \u03b2 is 3 in the left frame, 30 in the right one. All trilinear soft\nterms are fixed at 350 GeV in the left frame, and at 150 GeV in the right frame. From Ref.

A detailed analysis of chargino decays in these scenarios will be\npresented elsewhere [19].\nWe conclude this Section by listing the chargino decays due to the coupling \u03bb\u2032i32 and\n\u03bb\u2032i23 .

The tree-level contributions are mainly governed by Rp -violating bilinear couplings. The radiative contributions arise at the one- or the two-loop level. At\nthe one loop, they are controlled by trilinear superpotential Rp -violating couplings and\nleft-right sfermion mixing mass terms. The two-loop contributions are due to trilinear superpotential Rp -violating couplings, left-right sfermion mixing terms, and to Rp -violating\nsoft trilinear superpotential terms [20].\nThe tree-level mass is originated by bilinear Rp -violating terms, in particular by the\nmisalignment of superpotential bilinear terms,\nW = \u03bci Li HU\n\n(i = 1, 2, 3) ,\n\n(14)\n\nand scalar potential bilinear terms,\nV = Bi L\u0303i HU + m2Li H L\u0303i HU\n\n(i = 1, 2, 3) .\n\n(15)\n\n(The symbol HU indicates the isospin 1/2 doublet superfield as well as its scalar component.)

Choosing, for simplicity, the basis in which left- and right- components of the down quarks are diagonal, and assuming proportionality of the left-right\nsfermion matrices to the corresponding Yukawa matrices, i.e. (m2d \u0303LR )ij = Mdj (md )j \u03b4ij\nand (m2l\u0303 LR )ij = Mlj (ml )j \u03b4ij \u2020 , the contributions to the neutrino mass matrix entries from\nquark-squark loops read:\nm\u03bd,ii\u2032 \u223c\n\n3 X \u2032 \u2032\nMdk\n,\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n(m\n)\n(m\n)\n\u2032\nd\nj\nd\nk\n8\u03c0 2 kj ikj i jk\nm2d \u0303\n\n(19)\n\nk\n\nwhere md \u0303k is a squark mass eigenvalue, and both parameters Mdk and md \u0303k are linked to the\nmechanism of supersymmetry breaking. The analogous contributions from lepton-slepton\nloops is obtained by replacing \u03bb\u2032ijk with \u03bbijk in Eq. (19), and md with ml . The dominant\namong these contributions are those mediated by b-b\u0303 and by \u03c4 -\u03c4\u0303 . Neutrino mass terms\n\u2032\n\u22123\n\u22124\n<\n\u223c OeV), imply that \u03bbi33 and \u03bbi33 are smaller than 10 -10 for supersymmetric masses\nof 100 GeV. If no special tuning among other parameters occurs, e.g. if no hierarchy\nsuch as Md3 \u226a Md1 \u2243 Md2 is realized, trilinear couplings such as \u03bb\u2032i23 or \u03bb\u2032i32 , and \u03bbi23\nor \u03bbi32 , induce loop contributions suppressed by (ms /mb ) and (m\u03bc /m\u03c4 ), with respect to\nthe dominant ones. The suppression would be quadratic in the ratio of quark masses\nfor the one-loop contributions due to the couplings \u03bb\u2032i22 . Therefore, constraints obtained\n\u2020\n\nThe effect of non-diagonal left-right mass matrices on neutrino mass terms was considered in F. Borzumati et al. in Ref. [35].\n\n16\n\n\fby imposing that the terms in Eq. (19) are <\n\u223c O(1eV), are less powerful for couplings\ninvolving one quark index of first or second generation. It is interesting that, in general,\ncollider physics searches act exactly in the opposite way: direct constraints are stronger\nfor trilinear couplings with first and second generations indices, than for those containing\nthird generation indices.\nThe above formulas show how the predictability of generic Rp -violating models is\nmarred by the large number of parameters contributing to the different neutrino mass\nmatrix entries. To cope with this difficulty, two different simplifying assumptions are in\ngeneral made. They give rise to two different classes of models, which have been widely\ndiscussed in the literature.\nThe first is known as the class of bilinear Rp -violating models, in which only bilinear\nterms exist [36]. By rotating away the bilinear terms in the superpotential, the following\ntrilinear couplings are induced:\nD\n\u03bb\u2032ijk = yjk\n\u03bc\u0302i ,\n\nL\n\u03bbijk = yjk\n\u03bc\u0302i\n\n(i 6= j) ,\n\n(20)\n\nD\nL\nwhere yjk\nand yjk\nare, respectively, the down-quark and charged-lepton Yukawa coupling\nmatrices. In general, the largest neutrino mass term comes from the tree-level contribution. The second largest mass terms are due to b-b\u0303 loops, which give rise to entries in the\nneutrino mass matrix m\u03bd,ii\u2032 proportional to\n\n\u223c (3/8\u03c0 2)\u03bb\u2032i33 \u03bb\u2032i\u2032 33 m2b Md3 /m2b\u0303 = (3/8\u03c0 2)yb2 \u03bc\u0302i \u03bc\u0302i\u2032 m2b Md3 /m2b\u0303 .\nOther large mass terms are induced by \u03c4 -\u03c4\u0303 loops:\n\u223c (1/8\u03c0 2)\u03bbi33 \u03bbi\u2032 33 m2\u03c4 Md3 /m2\u03c4\u0303 = (1/8\u03c0 2 )y\u03c42 \u03bc\u0302i \u03bc\u0302i\u2032 m2\u03c4 Ml3 /m2\u03c4\u0303 ,\nwith i, i\u2032 6= 3, due to the fact that the couplings \u03bbijk are antisymmetric in the first\ntwo indices. The smallness of neutrino masses constrain the v.e.v's to be small, and in\nparticular the \u03bci 's to be small \u2021 . As a consequence, the trilinear couplings are also rather\nsmall, and so are the loop contributions to neutrino masses. The lightest neutralino decays\nmainly as \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 W \u2212 l+ induced by the mixing \u03c7\u030301 \u2212 \u03bd proportional to a neutral slepton\nv.e.v.. No signal for single-production of charged sleptons is expected in these cases.\nStrictly speaking, however, since the v.e.v's are an algebraic sum of two terms, the\nindividual contributions to the vi 's do not have to be small. If a certain amount of tuning\nof the individual contributions is allowed, these v.e.v's may be sufficiently suppressed.\nIn principle the suppression may be even strong enough to render the tree-level mass\ncontribution of Eq. (18) irrelevant for neutrino physics. Depending on the amount of\nsuppression, the rates for the 3-body decays of the lightest neutralino may be comparable\n\u2021\n\nIt is often assumed that such a low-energy situation is obtained from a model in which \u2206Bi , \u2206m2Li H\nand all the trilinear couplings are vanishing at some fundamental high scale. Nonvanishing \u2206Bi and\n\u2206m2Li H are induced by the parameters \u03bci when evolving the model down to low scale, whereas the\ntrilinear terms remain vanishing. As explained above, these result from a rotation of the superfields Li\nand HD . It is easy to show that in such a case the neutrino mass matrix generated by the tree-level and\nthe b-b\u0303-loop contributions has rank 1, and that the second heaviest neutrino is generated by \u03c4 -\u03c4\u0303 loops.\n\n17\n\n\fto that for the 2-body decay \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 W \u2212 l+ , or even larger. In such a case, the main\nsource for neutrino mass terms are the loop contributions, which must be duly suppressed.\nResponsible for their suppression may be parameters other than the trilinear couplings, i.e.\nother than the \u03bci 's. For example, nearly vanishing left-right mixing terms in the sfermion\nmass matrices, may be as effective as very small \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 parameters. Moreover, it should\nbe noted that the dominant one-loop contributions to m\u03bd,ii , i.e. those mediated by b-b\u0303\nand \u03c4 -\u03c4\u0303 are proportional to the combination of couplings (\u03bb\u2032i33 )2 and (\u03bbi33 )2 , respectively,\nand are therefore sensitive to the phases of these couplings. Thus, it is possible that\npartial cancellations among the b-b\u0303 loops and the \u03c4 -\u03c4\u0303 ones occur. Further suppression of\nthe b-b\u0303 loops may come from large sbottom masses. The observation of single production\nof sleptons would strongly hint at any of these possibilities, i.e. at unexpectedly large\nsbottom masses (even for not too heavy sleptons), small left-right mixing terms in the\nsfermion mass matrices, and/or special relations among the couplings of type \u03bb and those\nof type \u03bb\u2032 .\nThe second class of models that has been considered in the literature is that of models\nin which only trilinear Rp -violating terms exist at some high scale [38]. In such models,\nbilinear terms are induced by the trilinear couplings \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 , through the renormalization\ngroup equation. The misalignment term \u2206Bi and \u2206m2Li H and the sneutrino v.e.v's vi\nobtained at the electroweak scale are proportional to \u03bb\u2032ijj and \u03bbijj , in a basis in which\ndown-quark Yukawa couplings are diagonal. Barring accidental cancellations among the\ndifferent terms inducing the vi 's, the smallness of the tree-level contributions to neutrino\nmasses constrain these couplings to be small, if a nonnegligible mixing among left- and\nright-mass terms for sfermions exists. As a consequence, the leading loop contributions are\nalso suppressed and no significant yield for the strahlung of charged sleptons in association\nwith a t- (and possibly a b-) quark is expected. As in the previous class of models, this\ncould be observed only if left-right sfermion mixing terms are efficiently suppressed, and/or\nsquark masses are heavy, and/or phases in Rp -violation parameters induce cancellations\namong the different loop contributions. Other one-loop contributions to neutrino masses\nare due to the trilinear couplings \u03bbijk as well as \u03bb\u2032ijk (i 6= j). The constraints on these last\ncouplings are, in general, less limiting and one can expect to observe single production of\nsleptons, as for example pp \u2192 t\u03bc\u0303X or pp \u2192 t\u03bc\u0303sX, even without having to advocate the\nvanishing of other parameters or the mutual cancellation of different loop contributions.\n\nbe L\n\u0017e\n\nbe R\n\n\u0017i\n\nx\nx\nx0\n\n\u001f\n~j\n\nbe R\nbe L\n\n\u0017e\n\u0017i\n\n0\n\nFigure 13: A two-loop contribution to the Majorana neutrino mass arising from the \u2206L = 1\noperators in the scalar potential in Eq.

They are in general\n18\n\n\fneglected, since assumed to be subleading with respect to the one-loop contributions.\nThe diagram with exchange of squarks (and sleptons) in the upper loop, shown in Fig. 13,\nwas already discussed in Ref. [39], in a framework in which hard superpotential trilinear\nRp -violating couplings are vanishing, but soft trilinear Rp -violating couplings\n1\nV = A\u2032ijk L\u0303i Q\u0303j D\u0303 c k + Aijk L\u0303i L\u0303j \u1ebc c k\n2\n\n(21)\n\nare generated by supersymmetry breaking. (See also discussion in Ref. [40].) There are\nalso other diagrams with exchange of quarks (and leptons) in the upper loop, shown\non the left side of Fig. 14, and with exchange of squarks (and sleptons) but no leftright mixing in the sfermion lines, as shown on the right side of Fig. 14. If any of the\nmechanisms advocated above to suppress the one-loop contribution to neutrino mass\n(without suppressing the \u03bb- and \u03bb\u2032 -couplings) is present, these two-loop diagrams cannot\nbe neglected any longer [20].\n\n\u0017e\n\u0017i\n\nbL\n\nx\n\nbR\n\nbR\n\nx\n\nbL\n\n~bL;R\n\nx\n\n\u0017i\n\n\u001f\n~0j\n\n~bL;R\n\n\u0017e\n\n\u0017e\n\u0017\n\n0\n\nx\n\n\u001f\n~0\n\ni\n\nj\n\n\u0017e\n\u0017\n\n0\n\ni\n\nFigure 14: Two-loop contributions to the Majorana neutrino mass involving the same trilinear\nsuperpotential couplings \u03bb\u2032ijk present in the one-loop diagram of Fig. 12.\n\nThe sneutrino state \u03bd\u0303 has a CP-even and a CP-odd component that are degenerate at\nthe tree level. A splitting in the mass of these two components is induced at the quantum\nlevel [41] by the upper loops in Figs. 13 and 14. Because of this splitting, a nonvanishing\ncontribution to neutrino mass terms is originated. The contribution coming from the\ndiagram of Fig. 13 is:\nm\u03bd,ii\u2032\n\n\u0010\n\nmb Md3\n3gj2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u223c\nA A\u2032\n(16\u03c0 2 )2 i33 i 33\nm4b\u0303\n\n\u00112\n\nm\u03c7\u03030j\nm\u03bd\u03032\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nThe symbol Md3 is that already used in Eq. (19), i.e. Md3 mb is the left-right mixing terms\nin the sbottom mass matrix. Similarly, the diagrams in Fig. 14 yields the contribution:\nm\u03bd,ii\u2032 \u223c\n\nm\u03c7\u03030\n3gj2\n\u03bb\u2032i33 \u03bb\u2032i\u2032 33 m2b 2j ,\n2\n2\n(16\u03c0 )\nm\u03bd\u0303\n\n(23)\n\nwhere we have dropped a logarithmic dependence on mb\u0303 . For the overall coefficients in\nEqs. (22) and (23), see Ref. [20].\nOne way of suppressing the one-loop contribution to neutrino mass terms, and to\nevade constraints on the parameters \u03bb\u2032 , is to assume that Md3 \u2243 0. In such a case,\n19\n\n\fobviously, also the contribution from the diagram in Fig. 13 nearly vanishes. The contribution in Eq. (23), however, remain unsuppressed and yield therefore a constraint on the\ncouplings \u03bb\u2032i33 [20]:\n!1/2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n100 GeV\nm\u03bd\u0303\n\u2032\n\u03bbi33 <\n,\n(24)\n\u223c 0.01\n100 GeV\nm\u03c7\u03030\nwhere the SU(2) gauge coupling was used for the numerical evaluation. This is quite\nrobust since not affected by the size of squark masses. Similar constraints are obtained\nfor the couplings \u03bbi33 .\nFor such values of \u03bb\u2032i33 , the possibility of observing slepton strahlung at the LHC\ngets restricted to the kinematical region ml\u0303 \u2264 mt \u2212 mb , see the right frame in Fig. 7.\nWider reach of values for ml\u0303 , i.e. beyond the t-quark mark, are possible if sleptons\nare produced through the couplings \u03bb\u2032i32 or \u03bb\u2032i31 . Both, the one-loop and the two-loop\ncontributions to neutrino mass terms obtained in this case, are suppressed with respect\nto those of Eq. (23) by the factors (ms /mb ) and (md /mb ). The corresponding constraints\non these couplings get weakened by factors (mb /ms )1/2 and (mb /md )1/2 . Similarly, also\nthe couplings \u03bbij3 and \u03bbj3i may remain unsuppressed. As already observed in Section 3,\nthe 2 \u2192 2 process induced by \u03bb\u2032i32 or \u03bb\u2032i31 give rise to sleptons in association with a\nt-quark only. The subsequent decay of the sleptons through the couplings \u03bbij3 or \u03bbj3i ,\nmay give rise to an unsuppressed final state t\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bdj indistinguishable from the final state\nt\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 obtained from a charged Higgs boson. Therefore, through Rp -violating couplings,\nsleptons may contaminate the charged Higgs signal, even when constraints from neutrino\nphysics are imposed.\nLast, but not least, it should be kept in mind that even the bounds in Eq. (24) and\nthe corresponding one for the coupling \u03bbi33 may be evaded. For this, it is sufficient that\nspecial relations among the absolute value of \u03bb\u2032i33 and \u03bbi33 and the value of their phases\ninduce a partial cancellation between the contribution in Eq. (23) against that from the\nsimilar \u03c4 and \u03c4\u0303 diagrams. In this case, the possibility of observing slepton-strahlung\ninduced by the coupling \u03bb\u2032i33 may remain unaffected by neutrino mass constraints.\nIn turn, it is possible that the one-loop contribution to neutrino masses is, indeed,\nreduced by the smallness of the \u03bb\u2032 and \u03bb couplings, while the left-right mixing terms in\nthe sfermion mass matrices remain sizable. In such a case, the neutrino mass contribution\nfrom the two-loop fully scalar diagram in Fig. 13 induces strong constraints on the Rp violating soft couplings A\u2032i33 :\nA\u2032i33 Md3\n\n2\n<\n\u223c 100 GeV\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03bd\u0303\n100 GeV\n\n\u0013\n\n100 GeV\nm\u03c7\u03030\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nmb\u0303\n100 GeV\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nand similar ones for the couplings Ai33 . Note that this is an order of magnitude estimation.\nAn explicit calculation, in which no approximation is made on the loop function, may\nattenuate this constraint.\nWe conclude this Section by observing that constraints such as that in Eq. (24),\nwill also affect the possible production of sneutrinos through gluon fusion [6, 21, 22] and\n20\n\n\ftheir subsequent decays in two photons \u03bd\u0303 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. It has been suggested that sneutrinos\nin Rp -violating models may mimic neutral Higgs bosons and spoil their observation and\nmass determination. They can be produced through the elementary process bb\u0304 \u2192 \u03bd\u0303, as\nwell as strahlung processes, or through gluon fusion, as shown in Fig. 15. The first two\nproduction mechanisms are induced by the couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 . These same couplings are also\npartially responsible for the latter mechanism, as the first two diagrams in Fig. 15 show.\nThe last diagram, on the contrary, depends only on the couplings A\u2032i33 .\nbL\nx\n\nbR\n\nf\n\n\u0017f\n\nbL;R\n\nf\n\n\u0017f\n\nbL\nx\n\nf\n\nbL;R\n\n\u0017f\n\nf\n\nbR\n\nFigure 15: Gluon-fusion production of sneutrinos.\nFor these production mechanisms to be relevant, the generic constraints from neutrino\nphysics must be evaded. Having assumed some accidental cancellation of the tree-level\nneutrino contributions, vanishing left-right mixing terms in the down-squark mass matrices are enough to leave the couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 unconstrained by the one-loop contribution to\nneutrino masses. The bound from the two-loop contribution given in in Eq. (24), however,\nmay be enough to reduce the bb\u0304 \u2192 \u03bd\u0303 and strahlung production mechanisms to negligible\nlevels. The same is true also for the production through gluon fusion, since the first two\ndiagrams in Fig. 15 would be affected by small couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 and the third by a vanishing\nleft-right mixing in the sbottom mass matrix. In this case, a clean detection of the neutral\nHiggs boson signal may be hoped for. If on the contrary, the one-loop contribution to\nneutrino mass are reduced by tiny couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 , and the left-right mixing in the sbottom\nmass matrices are sizable, then single-production of sneutrinos remains possible through\nthe third gluon fusion diagram in Fig. 15. Parameters A\u2032i33 of order \u223c 10 GeV may give\nsmallish cross sections, but perhaps not so small not to affect the neutral Higgs boson\nsearches. Detailed studies on this topic are lacking and are clearly called for.\nIt is obviously also possible that the one-loop contribution to neutrino masses are\nsubject to other type of suppressions, such as the already mentioned cancellations among\nthe b \u2212 b\u0303 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0303 contributions. In such a case, the production of sneutrino at hadron\ncollider may still be relevant. Once again, we can only conclude that direct and indirect\nsearches should be pursed independently and should complement each other.\nIf neutrino physics constrains the Rp -violating trilinear couplings to be below the\n10\u22124 -10\u22123 mark, collider signals such as charged slepton strahlung and sneutrino decays\nwill be completely negligible. Such small couplings would still be relevant for phenomenological searches. They induce a decay of the lightest neutralino, which would be a stable\nparticle for vanishing values of these couplings. It is in general assumed that the effect of\nsuch couplings in other sectors would be completely irrelevant. However, in models with\nnearly-degenerate lightest chargino and lightest neutralino, couplings as small as 10\u22125\nmay affect also the phenomenology of the lightest chargino. For such values of trilinear\n21\n\n\f\u2212 0\ncouplings, the rate for the main decay mode of the lightest chargino \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u2192 W \u03c7\u03031 may\nbecome comparable or even smaller (depending on the actual value of the mass difference\nm\u03c7\u0303\u2212 \u2212 m\u03c7\u030301 ) than that for the Rp -violating chargino decay modes. Nearly-degenerate\n1\n0\n\u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 and \u03c7\u03031 are present in scenarios in which the lightest neutralino is mainly a Wino\nor a Higgsino. These scenarios are realized in specific model of supersymmetry breaking, such as anomaly-mediated supersymmetry-breaking models [32], or, for example, in\ngrand-unification models with an additional strong hypercolor group [33]. For studies of\nthe interesting signatures obtained in these cases, the reader is referred to Ref. [19].\n\n6\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nIn spite of the impressive confirmation that the Standard Model has obtained at LEP and\nat the Tevatron, the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is still elusive. Searches\nfor Higgs boson(s), which are likely to mediate it, will play a pivotal role in collider physics\nin the next coming years. Some of the issues that these searches will have to settle are if\nthere exist only one neutral Higgs boson or more, and if there are charged Higgs bosons,\ni.e. if there are additional Higgs fields that are doublets of SU(2). The discovery of a\ncharged Higgs boson will, undoubtedly, strengthen the case for supersymmetry. In order\nnot to miss such an important element of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\nat the LHC, it is important that the cross section for its production is not too small, so\nthat even heavy masses may be reached. As discussed in this review, the charged Higgs\nstrahlung is a suitable production mechanism under this point of view: cross sections at\nthe f b-level can be obtained even for charged Higgs masses of \u223c 1 TeV.\nThe determination of the charged Higgs mass is also crucial to nail down the parameters responsible for supersymmetry breaking. The cleanliness of this measurement,\nhowever, depends strongly on the fact that there are no other particles mimicking the\nsignals that charged Higgs bosons produce. In Rp -violating models, charged and neutral\nsleptons may lead to an incorrect determination of the charged and neutral Higgs boson\nmasses. The trilinear superpotential couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 and \u03bbi33 can give LHC production\ncross sections for charged and neutral sleptons very similar to that of the corresponding\ncharged and neutral Higgs bosons.\nWhen the lepton index i is of the third generation, they also give rise to the same final\nstates induced by the decays of Higgs bosons. This is true, however, if these couplings are\nnot much smaller than numbers of O(1). In the case of charged Higgs bosons and sleptons\nradiated from a quark line, then, searches of final states such as (2t)b\u0304(2\u03c4 \u2212 )X, obtained for\nheavy \u03c7\u030301 are necessary to establish whether the charged Higgs signal was contaminated\nby charged sleptons through sizable violation of the lepton number. Moreover, when the\nleptonic indices are of first or second generation, the presence of like-sign e's and \u03bc's in\npossible final states such as (2t)b\u0304(2\u03bc\u2212 )X or (2t)b\u0304(2e\u2212 )X, will unambiguously indicate that\ncharged sleptons have been produced. In addition, also first and second generation quark\njets, induced for example by couplings \u03bb\u2032ij3 or \u03bb\u2032i3j , are likely to arise from charged sleptons\n22\n\n\fand not from charged Higgs bosons. Interesting final states due to charged Higgs radiated\n\u2212\nfrom t-quark or c-quark lines are, for example, tt\u0304s, (2t)s\u0304(2l\u2212\ni )X, and (2c)b\u0304(2li )X, with\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\nli = \u03c4 , \u03bc , e .\nThe neutral Higgs bosons at the LHC will be mainly produced through gluon fusion,\nas well as strahlung off a top quark line. Sneutrino may also be produced in similar ways\nand with similar values of cross sections thanks to O(1) couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 [21] as well as\nelectroweak scale massive couplings A\u2032i33 . Also in this case, final states overlapping with\nthose of the neutral Higgs boson may be obtained.\nContaminations between the Higgs bosons and sleptons signals become negligible if\n\u03bb333 , \u03bb\u2032333 , and A\u2032i33 are sufficiently small. In general, no strong upper bounds have been\nobtained so far from direct searches of sparticle production and/or particle/sparticle decays. Neutrino physics, however, may play a crucial role in constraining such couplings.\nIt has been widely discussed in the literature how one-loop contributions to neutrino\nmasses impose that \u03bb\u2032i33 and \u03bbi33 are not lareger than 10\u22124 -10\u22123 . Since other unknown\nparameters enter the one-loop calculation, however, it is simple to evade these constraints.\nSeveral possible ways have been listed in this review. In addition, there exist two-loops\ncontributions to neutrino masses that are in general left out of discussion, since considered subleading. Nevertheless, the combinations of various parameters entering in the\ncalculation of the two-loop diagrams are different from those encountered in the calculation of the one-loop diagrams. Therefore, the two-loop diagrams may not be affected\nby the one-loop constraints. Although suffering a stronger loop-suppression with respect\nto the one-loop diagrams, they may still give too large contributions to neutrino masses.\nAs it is explicitly shown in this review, they yield constraints on the couplings \u03bb\u2032i33 and\n\u03bbi33 that are more difficult to evade (although not impossible), once specific choices of\nparameters are made to cancel the one-loop contributions. It turns out that \u03bb\u2032i33 and \u03bbi33\nare constrained to be a few %, whereas the couplings A\u2032i33 should not exceed the 10 GeV\norder of magnitude.\nValues of \u03bb\u2032i33 at the percent level, can still allow nonnegligible yields of charged\nsleptons at the LHC, although the production cross section is considerably smaller than\nthat for a charged Higgs boson of equal mass. Their detection, challenging, relies on the\nsearch for final states different than those produced by charged Higgs bosons. Sneutrinos\nmay still be produced at the LHC, through gluon fusion and/or strahlung off a quark\nline. Detailed studies of the impact of the parameters A\u2032i33 and of the distinguishability\nof sneutrinos from Higgs bosons are still missing.\nLepton violating couplings \u03bb\u2032i3j , \u03bb\u2032ij3 , with the quark index j of second and especially\nfirst generation, are much less affected by neutrino physics. The same is true for the\ncouplings \u03bbij3 and \u03bbj3i . As it was extensively discussed in Sections 2 and 3, it should be\nnoted that the 2 \u2192 2 elementary processes gs\u0304, g d\u0304 \u2192 tl\u0303i induced by the couplings \u03bb\u2032i3j , do\nnot need to be combined with the 2 \u2192 3 processes q q\u0304, gg \u2192 ts\u0304l\u0303i or q q\u0304, gg \u2192 td \u0304l\u0303i if the\nproduced sleptons l\u0303i decay leptonically. This is exactly the same situation encountered in\nthe case of strahlung-produced charged Higgs bosons that decay into \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 . Moreover the\n2 \u2192 2 cross section for slepton-strahlung due to the quark-flavour violating couplings \u03bb\u2032i3j ,\n23\n\n\fis bound to be larger than that obtained from a coupling \u03bb\u2032i33 of equal strengh, due to the\nlarger content of the d- and the s-quark in the proton. Therefore the subsequent decay of\nsuch sleptons into \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bdj induced by the couplings \u03bbij3 and \u03bbj3i will provide a final state\nidentical to that obtained from the charged Higgs. Sleptons of mass very close to that\nof the charged Higgs, would therefore affect the search of charged Higgs. A considerable\nsplitting among the mass of these particles may lead to exciting results at the LHC.\nAcknowledgements\nDiscussions with K. Hagiwara and W. Porod, as well as collaborations with R.
