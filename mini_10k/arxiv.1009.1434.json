GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\nAbstract. In the paper we introduce a transcendence degree of a zerocycle on a smooth projective variety X and relate it to the structure of\nthe motive of X. In particular, we show that in order to prove Bloch's\nconjecture for a smooth projective complex surface X of general type with\npg = 0 it suffices to prove that one single point of a transcendence degree\n2 in X(C), over the minimal subfield of definition k \u2282 C of X, is rationally\nequivalent to another single point of a transcendence degree zero over k.\nThis can be of particular interest in the context of Bloch's conjecture for\nthose surfaces which admit a concrete presentation, such as Mumford's fake\nsurface, see [13].\n\n1. Introduction\nSince [3] we know that the generic point, considered as a zero-cycle, plays\nan important role in the study of algebraic cycles on a smooth projective\nvariety X over a field k, because it can be considered as a specialization of the\ndiagonal carrying the motivic information at large. More precisely, let k be an\nalgebraically closed field, let d be the dimension of X, and let K = k(X) be\nthe function field on X. Consider a pull-back homomorphism\n\u03a6 : CH d (X \u00d7 X) \u2192 CH d (XK )\ninduced by the embedding of the generic point \u03b7 = Spec(K) into X. The\nkernel of \u03a6 is generated by correspondences supported on Z \u00d7 X, where Z\nruns Zariski closed subschemes in X different from X itself, see [10]. Hence,\nvarious motivic effects, given originally in terms of correspondences, i.e. cycle\nclasses in CH d (X \u00d7X), can be expressed in terms of zero-cycles on XK , modulo\nmotives of varieties of dimension < d.\nAssume, for example, that X is a surface of general type over an algebraically\nclosed field k, and the second Weil cohomology group H 2 (X) is algebraic. Let\n\u2206X be the diagonal on X \u00d7 X. Its specialization\nP\u03b7 = \u03a6(\u2206)\nis the generic point \u03b7 viewed as a zero-cycle on XK . Fix now a k-rational\npoint P0 on X. Let \u03a9 be a universal domain containing k and embed K into\n\u03a9 over k. In the paper we will show, see Corollary 8, that if P\u03b7 is rationally\nequivalent to P0 on X\u03a9 then any point P is rationally equivalent to any other\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14C15, 14C25.\nKey words and phrases. algebraic cycles, rational equivalence, motives, balanced correspondence, generic cycle, minimal field of definition, transcendence degree, Bloch's conjecture, rational curve.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\n\npoint Q on X\u03a9 , i.e. Bloch's conjecture hold's for X\u03a9 . As Bloch's conjecture\nis equivalent to finite-dimensionality of the motive M(X\u03a9 ), we see that the\nabove specialization map \u03a6 allows to reformulated motivic effects at large in\nterms of rational equivalence between two concrete points on X\u03a9 .\nCertainly, it is still not easy to prove (or disprove) rational equivalence\nbetween the above points P\u03b7 and P0 . One of the problems here consists of\nthe lack of rational curves on surfaces of general type with algebraic H 2 (X).\nHowever, we believe that any further progress towards Bloch's conjecture must\ninvolve analysis of a possibility of an explicit rational deformation of P\u03b7 into\nP0 on the surface X\u03a9 .\nThe above picture can now be generalized as follows. Let X be a smooth\nprojective variety\nPof dimension d over an algebraically closed field k. To any\nzero-cycle Z = i ni Pi on X one can define its transcendence degree as the\nmaximum of transcendence degrees of the residue fields k(Pi ). The transcendence degree of a zero-cycle class \u03b1 \u2208 CH d (X) is the exact lower bound of\nthe transcendence degrees of representatives of \u03b1. Then the motive M(X) is\na direct summand of motives of varieties of dimensions < d, twisted by Lefschetz motives, if and only if the transcendence degree of any zero-cycle class\n\u03b1 \u2208 CH d (X) is strictly smaller than d.\nA nice thing is that the last assertion is also equivalent to the fact that there\nexists a point P of transcendence degree d on X\u03a9 , rationally equivalent to a\nzero-cycle on X whose transcendence degree is strictly smaller than d. More\nprecisely, we prove the following theorem (see Theorem 7 in the text below):\nFor any smooth projective variety X of dimension d over k the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n(i) the class of the diagonal \u2206X is balanced;\n(ii) the Chow motive of X is a direct summand of a sum of motives\nof varieties of dimension strictly smaller than d;\n(iii) the transcendence degree of any zero-cycle class on X\u03a9 is\nstrictly less than d;\n(iv) there exists a closed point on X\u03a9 whose transcendence degree\nis d but the transcendence degree of its class modulo rational equivalence is strictly less than d.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Some motivic lemma\nBelow we will use the notation from [7]. In particular, all Chow groups will\nbe with coefficients in Q, unless the cases when integral coefficients will be\nsubscripted by Z. The category of Chow motives CM over a field k will be\ncontravariant. That is, if X and Y are two smooth projective varieties over k,\nand X is decomposed in to its connected components Xj , then the group of\ncorrespondences\nCH m (X, Y )\nof degree m from X to Y is a direct sum of the Chow groups\nCH ej +m (Xj \u00d7 Y ) ,\nwhere ej is the dimension of Xj . The composition of two correspondences\nf \u2208 CH n (X, Y ) and g \u2208 CH m (Y, Z) is standard\ng \u25e6 f = p13 \u2217 (p\u221712 (f ) * p\u221723 (g)) ,\nwhere the dot stands for the intersection of cycle classes in the sense of [6]. We\nalso have a contravariant functor M from the category of smooth projective\nvarieties over k to the category CM sending any variety X to its motive\nM(X) = (X, \u2206X , 0) ,\nwhere \u2206X is the diagonal class of X, and any morphism f : X \u2192 Y maps to\nthe class of transposition of its graph\n\u0393tf \u2208 CH 0 (X, Y ) .\nThe category of Chow motives CM is tensor, with the tensor product induced\nby the products of varieties. The unite motive\n\n1 = (Spec(k), \u2206Spec(k) , 0)\nand the Lefschetz motive\n\nL = (Spec(k), \u2206Spec(k) , \u22121)\nare related by the formula\nM(P1 ) = 1 \u2295 L .\nFor any positive integer m let Lm be the m-fold tensor power of the Lefschetz\nmotive L, let L0 = 1 and let L\u2212m = (L\u22121 )\u2297\u2212m , where\n\nL\u22121 = (Spec(k), \u2206Spec(k) , \u22121) .\nFurther details on Chow motives can be found, for example, in [7].\nThe next notion we need is the notion of balancing. Let X and Y be two\nequi-dimensional varieties over k. Similarly to [1], we say that a correspondence\n\u03b1 \u2208 CH m (X, Y ) is balanced on the left (respectively, on the right) if there exists\nan equi-dimensional Zariski closed subscheme Z \u2282 X, such that\ndim(Z) < dim(X) ,\nand an algebraic cycle \u0393 on X \u00d7 Y , such that [\u0393] = \u03b1 in CH m (X, Y ) and the\nsupport of \u0393 is contained in Z \u00d7 X (respectively, in X \u00d7 Z). The subscheme Z\n\n\f4\n\nS. GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\n\nwill be called a pan of balancing. We say that \u03b1 \u2208 CH m (X, Y ) is balanced if\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 + \u03b12 , where \u03b11 is balanced on the left, and \u03b12 is balanced on the right.\nBalancing was discovered in [3] and [5]. It is a motivic notion and can be\nrestated in purely motivic terms:\n\nLemma 1. Let X and Y be equidimensional smooth projective varieties over\nk, and let \u03b1 \u2208 CH m (X, Y ). Then \u03b1 is balanced on the left if and only if there\nexists an equidimensional smooth projective variety Z over k with\ndim(Z) < dim(X) ,\nsuch that \u03b1 factors through M(Z), that is \u03b1 is a composition\nM(X) \u2212\u2192 M(Z) \u2212\u2192 M(Y ) \u2297 L\u2212m .\nSymmetrically, the correspondence \u03b1 is balanced on the right if and only if\nthere exists an equidimensional smooth projective variety Z over k with\nn = dim(Y ) \u2212 dim(Z) > 0 ,\nsuch that \u03b1 is a composition\nM(X) \u2212\u2192 M(Z) \u2297 Ln\u2212m \u2212\u2192 M(Y ) \u2297 L\u2212m .\nProof. If m = 0 and the closed subscheme Z is smooth, then the lemma is just\nobvious. Indeed, let i : Z \u0592\u2192 X be the closed embedding, and let \u0393ti be the\ntranspose of the graph of the embedding i. If \u03b1 is balanced on the left then it\ncan be considered as a correspondence of degree zero from Z to Y . Therefore,\nthe correspondence \u03b1 from X to Y is a composition of the correspondence \u0393ti\nwith \u03b1 as a correspondence from Z to Y .\nThe detailed proof of the lemma when Z is not necessarily smooth and\nm 6= 0 is given in [7].\nIn the next section we will introduce the transcendence degree of a zero cycle\non a smooth projective variety and we will show how it is related to balancing\nof the diagonal, and so the above motivic factorizations from Lemma 1.\n3. Transcendence degree of zero-cycles\nFirst we need to recall some well-known things from the theory of schemes.\nLet k be a field, and let X be an algebraic scheme over k. Let k \u2282 K\nbe a field extension. Recall that a K-point on X is a morphism of schemes\nP : Spec(K) \u2192 X over Spec(k). A subextension k \u2282 L \u2282 K is a field of\ndefinition of the point P if there exists a morphism\npL : Spec(L) \u2212\u2192 X ,\n\n\fTRANSCENDENCE DEGREE OF ZERO-CYCLES\n\n5\n\nsuch that the following diagram is commutative\nP\n\nSpec(K)\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\n$$\n\n// X\nz<<\nz\nzz\nzz\nz\nzz\nzz PL\nz\nzz\nzz\nz\nz\n\nSpec(L)\n\nas a diagram over Spec(k).\nLet \u03beP be the image of the unique point in Spec(L) with respect to the\nmorphism P , and let k(\u03beP ) be the residue field of the point \u03beP on the scheme\nX. Then k(\u03beP ) is the minimal field of definition of the point P , i.e. the\ninitial object in the category of fields of definition of the point P , because\nk(\u03beP ) \u0592\u2192 L and the above morphism PL factors through the natural morphism\nSpec(k(\u03beP )) \u2192 X.\nBy definition, the transcendence degree of the point P over the ground field\nk is the transcendence degree of the field k(\u03beP ) over k:\ntr.deg(P/k) = tr.deg(k(\u03beP )/k) .\nThus, the transcendence degree tr.deg(P/k) is the transcendence degree of\nthe minimal field of definition of the point P over the ground field k.\nNotice that if k \u2282 L \u2282 K is a field subextension then one has a commutative\ndiagram\nQL\n\nSpec(K)\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\n$$\n\n//\n\nX \u00d7Spec(k) Spec(L)\n\nq\nqqq\nq\nq\nqq\nqqq\nq\nq\nqq\nqqq\nq\nq\nqxx qq\n\nSpec(L)\n\nNotice that the transcendence degree tr.deg(QL /L) can be different from the\ntranscendence degree tr.deg(P/k). For example, tr.deg(Pk(\u03beP ) /k(\u03beP )) = 0.\nLet Y be the Zariski closure of the schematic point \u03beP in X. Then Y is a\nclosed irreducible subscheme in X and\ntr.deg(P/k) = dimk (Y ) .\nIt follows, in particular, that\ntr.deg(P/k) \u2264 dimk (X) .\nNow we are going to introduce the notion of a transcendence degree of a\nzero-cycle on a variety. Let \u03a9 be a universal domain containing k. Suppose X\nis an equidimensional variety, and let d be the dimension of X.\n\n\f6\n\nS. GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\n\nDefinition 2. A transcendence degree tr.deg(\u03b1/k) of a zero-cycle class \u03b1 \u2208\nCH d (X\u03a9 ) over k is the minimal natural number n, such that there exists a\nzero-cycle\nX\nZ=\nni Pi\ni\n\non X\u03a9 representing the class \u03b1 with the property\ntr.deg(Pi /k) \u2264 n\nfor all i.\n\nThe following properties of the transcendence degree for zero-cycles follow\ndirectly from the above definition.\nLemma 3. Let X be an equidimensional variety over k of dimension d. Then\nthe following is true:\n(i) for any element \u03b1 \u2208 CH d (X\u03a9 ) one has\ntr.deg(\u03b1/k) \u2264 d;\n(ii) for all elements \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 CH d (X\u03a9 ) we have that\ntr.deg((\u03b1 + \u03b2)/k) \u2264 max{tr.deg(\u03b1/k) , tr.deg(\u03b2/k)};\n(iii) given a field subextension k \u2282 K \u2282 \u03a9 and an element \u03b2 \u2208\nCH d (XK ), we have an inequality\ntr.deg(\u03b2 \u03a9 /k) \u2264 tr.deg(K/k) .\nRemark 4. Not any cycle class \u03b1 \u2208 CH d (X\u03a9 ) is equal to \u03b2 \u03a9 , for some\n\u03b2 \u2208 CH d (XK ) and K with tr.deg(K/k) = tr.deg(\u03b1/k). Let, for example, X\nbe a smooth projective curve of genus at least two. Then there exists a point\nP of transcendence degree at least two on the Jacobian variety Jac(X) of X\nover k. Let \u03b1 be a cycle class in the Chow group CH 1 (X\u03a9 )0 of degree zero\n0-cycles on the curve X corresponding to the point P under the isomorphism\nCH 1 (X\u03a9 )0 = Jac(X)\u03a9 .\nThen tr.deg(\u03b1) \u2264 1 because dim(X) = 1. Suppose now that \u03b1 comes from\nan element \u03b2 \u2208 CH 1 (XK )0 by means of the scalar extension from K to \u03a9,\nwhere tr.deg(K/k) = 1. Since the isomorphism between the Chow group of\ndegree zero 0-cycles and the Jacobian commutes with scalar extensions of the\nground field, the point P must be defined over K, which is impossible as\ntr.deg(P/k) = 2.\nWe will also use the following fact.\nLemma 5. Let X and Y be two smooth projective equidimensional varieties\nover k, let d = dim(X), e = dim(Y ) and assume e < d. Let \u03c6 be a correspondence of degree d \u2212 e from Y to X, that is \u03c6 is a morphism of Chow\nmotives\nM(Y ) \u2297 L\u2297(d\u2212e) \u2212\u2192 M(X) .\n\n\fTRANSCENDENCE DEGREE OF ZERO-CYCLES\n\n7\n\nThen for any element \u03b1 \u2208 CH e (Y\u03a9 ) one has\ntr.deg((\u03c6\u03a9 )\u2217 (\u03b1)/k) \u2264 tr.deg(\u03b1/k) .\nProof. Let\n\nP\n\ni\n\nni Pi be a zero-cycle on Y\u03a9 , such that\n\"\n#\nX\n\u03b1=\nni Pi ,\ni\n\nand\n\ntr.deg(Pi /k) \u2264 tr.deg(\u03b1/k)\nfor all i. By linearity of the push-forward homomorphism (\u03c6\u03a9 )\u2217 and also by\nLemma 3 (ii), it is enough to show that\ntr.deg((\u03c6\u03a9 )\u2217 [Pi ]/k) \u2264 tr.deg(Pi /k)\nholds true for all indices i.\nLet P be one of the points Pi . By the definition of a transcendence degree\nof a point there exists a field K, such that\ntr.deg(K/k) = tr.deg(P/k) ,\nand a point W \u2208 Y (K), such that\nW\u03a9 = P .\nMoreover,\n(\u03c6\u03a9 )\u2217 [P ] = ((\u03c6K )\u2217 [W ])\u03a9 .\nSince (\u03c6K )\u2217 [W ] \u2208 CH (XK ), by Lemma 3(3), we see that\nd\n\ntr.deg((\u03c6\u03a9 )\u2217 [P ]/k) \u2264 tr.deg(K/k) = tr.deg(P/k) ,\nwhich completes the proof.\nRemark 6. Certainly, one can also define the notion of a transcendence degree\nfor all closed irreducible subschemes in X\u03a9 and, respectively, for elements\nin Chow groups CH p (XC ) of arbitrary codimension p. Moreover, analogs of\nLemma 3 (ii) (iii) and Lemma 5 imply that a transcendence degree is also\nwell-defined for elements in Chow groups of Chow motives over k, and that\nthis transcendence degree does not increase under taking push-forwards with\nrespect to morphisms between Chow motives over k.\nNow we are ready to prove our main statement.\nTheorem 7. Let X be an irreducible smooth projective variety over k of dimension d. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) the class of the diagonal \u2206X is balanced in CH d (X \u00d7 X);\n(ii) the Chow motive M(X) is isomorphic to a direct summand of the\nmotive\nM(Y1 ) \u2295 (M(Y2 ) \u2297 Ld\u2212e ) ,\nwhere Y1 and Y2 are equidimensional smooth projective varieties over\nk whose dimensions are strictly less than d, and e is the dimension of\nthe variety Y2 ;\n\n\f8\n\nS. GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\n\n(iii) any element \u03b1 \u2208 CH d (X\u03a9 ) satisfies\ntr.deg(\u03b1/k) < d ;\n(iv) there exists a closed point P \u2208 X\u03a9 , such that tr.deg(P/k) = d and\ntr.deg([P ]) < d ,\nwhere [P ] is the class of the point P in CH d (X\u03a9 ).\nProof.\n(i) \u21d2 (ii)\nSuppose that [\u2206X ] = \u03b11 + \u03b12 , where \u03b11 is balanced on the left and \u03b12 is\nbalanced on the right. By Lemma 1, there exist two equidimensional varieties\nY1 and Y2 as in (2), and factorizations of \u03b11 and \u03b12 , so that \u03b1 factorizes like\nthis:\nM(X) \u2192 M(Y1 ) \u2192 M(X),\n\nM(X) \u2192 M(Y2 ) \u2297 Ld\u2212e \u2192 M(X) .\n\nPut M := M(Y1 ) \u2295 (M(Y2 ) \u2297 Ld\u2212e ). Then the identity morphism from M(X)\nto itself factors through M, thus, M(X) is a direct summand in M.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii)\nLooking at the Chow groups of the motives involved in the decomposition\nM(X) \u2212\u2192 M(Y1 ) \u2295 (M(Y2 ) \u2297 Ld\u2212e ) \u2212\u2192 M(X)\nwe see that all elements in CH d (X\u03a9 ) are push-forwards with respect to the\nmorphism\nM(Y2 ) \u2297 Ld\u2212e \u2212\u2192 M(X) ,\nas\nCH d (M((Y1 )\u03a9 )) = CH d ((Y1 )\u03a9 ) = 0\nbecause e < d. Then (iii) follows from Lemma 5 and Lemma 3 (i).\n(iii) \u21d2 (iv)\nThis is just obvious.\n(iv) \u21d2 (i)\nP\nLet i ni Pi be a zero-cycle on X\u03a9 , such that\n\"\n#\nX\n[P ] =\nni Pi ,\ni\n\nand\n\ntr.deg(Pi /k) < d .\nBy definition of a transcendence degree, there are field extensions\nK \u2282 \u03a9 and Ki \u2282 \u03a9\nover k, and points\nW \u2208 X(K) , Wi \u2208 X(Ki ) ,\n\n\fTRANSCENDENCE DEGREE OF ZERO-CYCLES\n\n9\n\nsuch that\nW\u03a9 = P ,\n\n(Wi )\u03a9 = Pi ,\n\nthe fields K and Ki are finitely generated over k with\ntr.deg(K/k) = d and tr.deg(Ki /k) < d .\nLet L be the composite of the fields K and Ki in \u03a9. As\n\"\n#\nX\n[P ] =\nni Pi \u2208 CH d (X\u03a9 )\ni\n\nand all involved Chow groups are with coefficients in Q, one has\n\"\n#\nX\n[WL ] =\nni (Wi )L \u2208 CH d (XL ) ,\ni\n\nsee [3], page 1.21.\nLet now V be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective variety over k, such that\nk(V ) = K .\nThen we also have a rational dominant morphism\nf : V 99KX ,\nwhich coincides at the generic point with the morphism W : Spec(K) \u2192 X.\nSimilarly, for each i, we have a smooth irreducible quasi-projective variety\nVi with k(Vi ) = Ki , and a rational dominant morphism\nfi : Vi 99KX\ninducing the morphism Wi : Spec(Ki ) \u2192 X at the generic point.\nShrinking the varieties V and Vi to Zariski open subsets one can think that\nthe above morphisms f and fi are all regular.\nWe also need a smooth irreducible quasi-projective variety Z over k with\ndominant regular morphisms g : Z \u2192 V and gi : Z \u2192 Vi , such that the\nfunction field k(Z) coincides with L.\nFor any regular morphism h let \u0393h be the graph of h.

By taking pull-backs in Chow groups with respect to the\nembedding T \u00d7 X \u2192 Z \u00d7 X, we obtain\n\"\n#\nX\n[\u0393f h ] =\nni \u0393fi hi\ni\n\nd\n\nin the group CH (T \u00d7 X).\nSince dim(T ) = d and the composition f h : T \u2192 X is dominant, we see\nthat f h is generically finite. Thus, shrinking T to a non-empty open subset,\nwe may assume that the morphism f h is a finite surjective morphism from T\nonto a non-empty open subset U in X.\nNow we use push-forwards in Chow groups with respect to the finite morphism\nf h \u00d7 idX : T \u00d7 X \u2212\u2192 U \u00d7 X .\nFrom the above equality we obtain that\n\"\n#\nX\n(f h \u00d7 idX )\u2217 [\u0393f h ] = (f h \u00d7 idX )\u2217\nni \u0393fi hi\ni\n\nd\n\nin the group CH (U \u00d7 X).\nSet-theoretically,\n\n(f h \u00d7 idX )(\u0393f h ) = \u2206X \u2229 (U \u00d7 X) .\nThe closure of (f h \u00d7 idX )(\u0393fi hi ) in X \u00d7 X is contained in X \u00d7 fi (Wi ), where\nfi (Wi ) is the Zariski closure of fi (Wi ) in X.\nSince\ndim(Vi ) = tr.deg(Ki /k) < d\nand all the Chow groups are with rational coefficients, we see that \u2206X is\nbalanced.\nRemark. The equivalence (i) \u21d4 (ii) was actually proved in [8] but we included it in the theorem for the convenience of the reader.\n4. An example\nAn important thing in Theorem 7 is that (iv) implies (i). Let us illustrate\nthis by an example.\nLet X be a smooth projective surface over C, of general type and with\npg = 0. Recall, that Bloch's conjecture predicts that for any two closed points\nP and Q on XC the point P is rationally equivalent to Q. This conjecture is a\ncodimension 2 case of the Bloch-Beilinson paradigma for algebraic cycles, and\nit is highly inaccessible. It is known for surfaces with the Kodaira dimension\n< 2, [4], for finite quotients of products of curves, [11], and for surfaces of\ngeneral type (which are not finite quotients of products of curves) in [9], [2]\nand [17].\nLet now k be the algebraic closure in C of the minimal field of definition\nof the surface X, and let K = k(X) be the function field of X over k. Let\n\n\fTRANSCENDENCE DEGREE OF ZERO-CYCLES\n\n11\n\n\u03b7 = Spec(K) be the generic point of X, and let P\u03b7 be the corresponding\nK-rational closed point on XK . Theorem 7 implies the following corollary:\nCorollary 8. Bloch's conjecture holds for X if and only if there exist an\nembedding of K into C over k, and a k-rational point P on X, such that the\nabove closed K-rational point P\u03b7 is rationally equivalent to P on X as a variety\nover C.\nThis can be made absolutely explicit in the case of Godeaux surfaces, for\nwhich Bloch's conjecture was proved by C.Voisin in [17]. Namely, let \u03bc5 be the\ngroup of 5-th roots of the unit in C, and let \u01eb be a primitive root in it. The\ngroup \u03bc5 acts on P3 by the rule:\n[x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 ] 7\u2192 [x0 : \u01ebx1 : \u01eb2 x2 : \u01eb3 x3 ]\nLet f = f (x) be a \u03bc5 -invariant smooth quintic form in P3 , and let Y = Z(f )\nbe the set of zeros of f in P3 . Since f is \u03bc5 -invariant, the group \u03bc5 acts on\nY . Assume, in addition, that Y does not contain the four fixed points of the\naction of \u03bc5 on P3 . Then the quotient surface\nX = Y /\u03bc5\nis non-singular, and it is called a Godeaux surface. It is well known that\npg = q = 0 for such X, see [16].\nTake now two transcendental complex numbers which are algebraically independent over Q, say e and e\u03c0 , see [14]. Let \u03b1 be one of the zeros of the\npolynomial obtained by substitution of the coordinates e and e\u03c0 in to the\naffinized form f . Then P\u03b7 can be represented as the class of the point\n(e, e\u03c0 , \u03b1) \u2208 C3\nunder the quotient-map Y \u2192 X.\nThen Voisin's result says that the point P\u03b7 is rationally equivalent to a point\nin X(Q\u0304). The specificity of Corollary 8 is that it says that the above rational\nequivalence between two single points on X(C) is the only reason for vanishing\nof the whole Albanese kernel in this situation.\nWe believe that this observation can be useful in approaching to Bloch's\nconjecture in some concrete contexts, such as Mumford's fake surface, see [13].\nRecall that such surfaces were recently classified in [15].\nWARNING. It would be a temptation to find a rational curve through the\npoints P\u03b7 and P0 on the Godeaux surface X over C. The first problem is that\nX is a surface of general type whose discrete invariants vanish, so that one can\nexpect only a few rational curves on XC . But this is not yet the main trouble.\nThe main difficulty is that no rational curves can pass through P\u03b7 at all.\nIndeed, let X be a smooth projective surface over the ground subfield k\nin \u03a9. Let P\u03b7 be a closed point of transcendence degree 2 on X\u03a9 . Suppose\nthere exists a field subextension k \u2282 K \u2282 \u03a9, a point P : Spec(K) \u2192 X with\ntr.deg(P/k) = 2, and a rational curve C on XK passing through the point\nP . Let us show that X is uniruled then. Without loss of generality one can\n\n\f12\n\nS. GORCHINSKIY, V. GULETSKI\u012c\n\nassume that K is finitely generated over k. Let Y be an irreducible variety over\nk, such that K is the function field of Y over k.The rational curve C \u2282 XK\ninduces a morphism\n\u03c6 : P1K \u2212\u2192 XK\nwhich induces a rational morphism\nP1 \u00d7k Y 99K X \u00d7k Y ,\nsuch that\nf \u00d7Y Spec(K) = \u03c6 .\nThe point p gives a morphism\nSpec(K) \u2192 P1 \u00d7k K\nover K. This corresponds to some rational section of the projection\nP1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y .\nThe morphism\nSpec(K) \u2192 P1K \u2192 XK \u2192 X\nsends the unique point in Spec(K) in to the generic point of X because\ntr.deg(p/k) = 2. Therefore, the composition\nf\n\npX\n\nY 99K P1 \u00d7k Y 99K X \u00d7k Y 99K X\nis dominant, where pX is the projection onto X. It follows that the morphism\nP1 \u00d7k Y \u2212\u2192 X\nis dominant as well. Moreover, the induced map\nP1K \u2212\u2192 XK\ngives a birational isomorphism with its image. It follows that this image is a\ncurve in XK . Hence, the map\nP1 \u00d7k Y \u2212\u2192 X\ndoes not factor through the projection P1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y . Hence, at least for one\npoint y \u2208 Y the induced map\nP1y \u2212\u2192 X\nis not constant. Hence, X is uniruled by [12, 1.3.4]\nThus, if we could have a rational curve through P\u03b7 on a smooth projective\nsurface XC , of general type with pg = 0, then immediately we would get a\ncontradiction as such a surface is very far from to be uniruled.\nThis shows that in order to find a precise rational equivalence between P\u03b7\nand P0 we need to find more than one curves of genus > 0 on the Godeaux\nsurface X, and rational functions of them, which will provide a suitable zeropoles cancelation for their principle divisors.\n\n\fTRANSCENDENCE DEGREE OF ZERO-CYCLES\n\n13\n\nReferences\n[1] L.Barbieri Viale.
