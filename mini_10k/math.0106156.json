GUNNELLS\n\n1. Introduction\nLet l > 1 be an integer, and consider the congruence subgroup \u03931 (l) \u2282 SL2 (Z) defined by\n\u0010 a b \u0011 \u0010 1 \u2217 \u0011\n=\nmod l.\nc d\n0 1\nLet M\u2217 (l) = M\u2217 (\u03931 (l), C) be the ring of holomorphic modular forms on \u03931 (l). In this talk we\nuse the combinatorics of complete toric varieties to construct a subring T\u2217 (l) \u2282 M\u2217 (l), the subring\nof toric modular forms (\u00a72). This is a natural subring, in the sense that it behaves nicely with\nrespect to natural operations on M\u2217 (l) (namely, Hecke operators, Fricke involution, and the theory\nof oldforms and newforms). Moreover, an explicit structure theorem for T\u2217 (l) together with the\ntheory of Manin symbols allows us to describe the cuspidal part of T\u2217 (l) in terms of nonvanishing of\nspecial values of L-functions (\u00a73). Finally, we discuss an explicit scheme-theoretic embedding of the\nmodular curve X1 (l) = \u03931 (l)\\H\u2217 in a weighted projective space that was inspired by the structure\nof T\u2217 (l) (\u00a74).\nThe results of \u00a7\u00a72\u20133 are joint work with Lev Borisov, and can be found in the papers [1, 2, 3]; the\nembedding of the modular curve in \u00a74 is joint work with with Lev Borisov and Sorin Popescu and\nappears in [4]. It is a pleasure to thank them for their stimulating and interesting collaboration.\n2. Construction and basic properties\nLet d be a positive integer, let N be a rank d lattice, let M be the dual lattice, and let h , i : M \u00d7\nN \u2192 Z be the pairing. Let \u03a3 \u2282 NR = N \u2297R be a complete rational polyhedral fan. A degree function\ndeg : N \u2192 C is a piecewise-linear function that is linear on the cones of \u03a3. We define a function\nfN,deg : H \u2192 C by\n\u0010X\n\u0011\u0011\nX \u0010X\nfN,deg (q) :=\nq hm,ni e2\u03c0i deg(n) .\n(\u22121)codim C a.c.\n(1)\nm\u2208M C\u2208\u03a3\n\nHere q = e\n\n2\u03c0i\u03c4\n\nn\u2208C\n\n, where \u03c4 \u2208 H, the upper halfplane, and the a.c. denotes analytic continuation.\n\nTheorem 2.1. Suppose deg takes values in l\u22121 Z, and that deg is not integral valued on the primitive\ngenerator of any 1-cone of \u03a3. Then fN,deg (q) \u2208 Md (l), i.e. f is the q-expansion of a holomorphic\nmodular form on \u03931 (l).\nTo prove this theorem, one begins by showing that this series is well-defined, in the sense that\nonly finitely many terms contribute to a given power of q. To prove modularity, let X\u03a3 be the toric\nvariety associated to \u03a3. Then if X\u03a3 is smooth, one uses the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem to\nshow\nZ Y\n(D/2\u03c0i)\u03b8(D/2\u03c0i \u2212 \u03b1D , \u03c4 )\u03b8\u2032 (0, \u03c4 )\n,\nfN,deg (q) =\n\u03b8(D/2\u03c0i, \u03c4 )\u03b8(\u2212\u03b1D , \u03c4 )\nX\u03a3\nD\n\nDate: June 16, 2001.\nPartially supported by the NSF.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPAUL E. GUNNELLS\n\nwhere D ranges over the torus-invariant divisors of X\u03a3 , \u03b1D is the value of deg on the primitive\ngenerator of the 1-cone corresponding to D, and \u03b8(z, \u03c4 ) is Jacobi's theta function. The expression\nin the integrand is evaluated in the cohomology ring H \u2217 (X\u03a3 ) using the triple product formula for\n\u03b8. The case of singular X\u03a3 is handled using a limiting argument.\nLet T\u2217 (l) be the full subring of M\u2217 (l) given by taking all C-linear combinations of all fN,deg .\nTheorem 2.2. T\u2217 (l) is closed under the action of the Hecke operators, the Fricke involution, and\nAtkin-Lehner lifting.\nThese statements are proved by direct manipulations of fans and degree functions. For example,\nif p is a prime not dividing l, the action of Hecke operator Tp on fN,deg is given by\nTp fN,deg =\n\nX\np \u2212 pd\u22121\nfN,deg +\nfS,p deg ,\np\u22121\nS\n\n1\npN\n\nwhere the sum is taken over lattices S satisfying N \u2282 S \u2282\nand [S : N ] = pd\u22121 . Note that these\nlattices are not the usual lattices involved in the definition of the Hecke operators.\nRemark 2.3. The definition (1) was motivated by L. Borisov and A. Libgober's computation of the\nelliptic genera of toric varieties [5]. Also, similar sums were studied by W. Nahm, who showed that\nthey had (quasi)modular properties [8].\n3. Special values of L-functions\nA natural question is how far is T\u2217 (l) from being all of M\u2217 (l). The inclusion T\u2217 (l) \u2282 M\u2217 (l) is\ncertainly proper, since for example there are no weight 1 cusp forms in T1 (l). However, it turns out\nthat almost all modular forms are toric. To state the precise result, let \u03be = e2\u03c0i/l , and for 0 < a < l\nlet sa = sa (q) be the weight 1 Eisenstein series\nX X\n\u03bea + 1\n1 d\n(\u03be ka \u2212 \u03be \u2212ka ).\nln \u03b8(z, \u03c4 )|z=a/l =\n\u2212\nqd\nsa (q) =\n2\u03c0i dz\n2(\u03be a \u2212 1)\nd\n\nk|d\n\nFor each k, let Mk (l) = Sk (l) \u2295 Ek (l) be the decomposition into cusp forms and Eisenstein series.\nGiven a Hecke eigenform f , let L(f, s) be the associated L-function.\nTheorem 3.1. The ring T\u2217 (l) is multiplicatively generated by the sa , 0 < a < l. In weight two,\nT2 (l) modulo E2 (l) is equal to the C-span of all Hecke eigenforms f with L(f, 1) 6= 0. For weights\nk \u2265 3, the space Tk (l) coincides with Mk (l) modulo Ek (l).\nIn other words, the cuspidal part of Tk (l) is easy to describe: for weights \u2265 3 all cusp forms\nare toric, and for weight 2 only those in the span of the \"analytic rank 0\" forms are toric. In\ngeneral, however, it is not clear what Eisenstein series are toric. For example, in weight 2 the space\nT2 (25) \u2229 E2 (25) has codimension one in E2 (25).\nThe proof of this theorem is a computation with Manin symbols [7]. The space M (l) of Manin\nsymbols of level l is the C-vector space generated by the symbols\n\b\n(a, b) \u2208 (Z/lZ)2 | Za + Zb = Z/lZ ,\n\nmodulo certain relations. This space is dual to the space S2 (l) in the following sense. To each\nsymbol (a, b), one can associate an ideal geodesic \u03b3 on H. There is an involution on M (l) that\ndefines two subspaces M \u00b1 (l). Then there are two subspaces S \u00b1 (l) \u2282 M \u00b1 (l) such that the pairings\nS \u00b1 (l) \u00d7 S2 (l) \u2192 C given by integration of a cuspform along a chain are perfect. Moreover the two\nsubspaces S \u00b1 (l) are dual to each other via the intersection pairing on cycles on X1 (l).\n\n\fON TORIC VARIETIES AND MODULAR FORMS\n\n3\n\nThe key point to the computation is that modulo Eisenstein series the product sa sb has properties\nsimilar to the the symbol (a, b) \u2208 M \u2212 (l). This allows us to define a map \u03bc : M \u2212 \u2192 M2 (l)/E2 (l) \u223c\n=\nS2 (l) by (a, b) 7\u2192 sa sb . Then we define a map \u03c6 : S2 (l) \u2192 S2 (l) by\n\u0011\nX\nX \u0010Z i\u221e\nf=\nan q n 7\u2212\u2192\nan\n(Tn f ) d\u03c4 q n ,\n0\n\nwhere Tn is the nth Hecke operator. This map has the property that \u03c6(f ) = 0 if f is a new eigenform\nwith L(f, 1) = 0. Finally using Merel's universal formula for the Hecke action on Manin symbols, an\nexplicit description of the intersection pairing on X1 (l), and some manipulations with the product\nof q-expansions sa (q)sb (q), we show that \u03c6 factors through \u03bc.\nFor higher weights the argument is similar and its conclusion is identical. We then appeal to a\ntheorem of Jacquet and Shalika [6] that implies L(f, 1) cannot vanish for a new eigenform of weight\n\u2265 3.\n4. Equations of modular curves\nLet p \u2265 5 be a prime. Given the simple description of T\u2217 (p) and its relation with the forms of\nanalytic rank 0, one is interested in estimating dim T2 (p). As a first step in this direction, we have\nstudied the (incomplete) linear system on the modular curve X1 (p) induced the weight 1 Eisenstein\nseries sa .\nTheorem 4.1. Let P be the weighted projective space\nProj C[sa , tb | 0 < a, b < p],\nwhere deg sa = 1, and deg tb = 2. Then the modular curve X1 (p) is scheme-theoretically cut out\nfrom P by the equations (1) sa = \u2212sp\u2212a , (2) tb = tp\u2212b , and (3) sa sb + sb sc + sc sa = ta + tb + tc if\na + b + c = 0 mod p.\nHere the variables tb correspond to certain weight 2 Eisenstein series on X1 (p).\nTo prove this theorem, we first show that the map X1 (p) \u2192 P(p\u22123)/2 defined by \u03c4 7\u2192 {sa (\u03c4 )} is\na closed embedding. Then we construct a system of differential equations\n1 X\ndra\n=\u2212\nrk ra\u2212k + 2ra sa ,\ndz\np\u22122\n\na \u2208 (Z/pZ)\u00d7\n\nk6=0,a\n\nthat mimics the system satisfied by the set of elliptic functions\nz 7\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03b8(a/p \u2212 z, \u03c4 )\u03b8z (0, \u03c4 )\n,\n\u03b8(\u2212z, \u03c4 )\u03b8(a/p, \u03c4 )\n\nhaving poles only along a p-torsion subgroup. We construct \"standard solutions\"\nra (z) =\n\n1\n+ s a + ta z + * * * ,\nz\n\nwhich satisfy certain quadratic relations. If we define a ring using these relations, we get a ring with\nthe same Hilbert function as the coordinate ring of an elliptic normal curve C of degree p in Pp\u22121 .\nThen we show that C is singular if and only if C is a p-gon if and only if the coordinates {sa , tb }\ncorrespond to a cusp of X1 (p). Finally we show that a deformation of a solution to our system leads\nto a deformation of the elliptic curve, which leads to an identification of the scheme defined by the\nequations in the theorem with X1 (p).\n\n\f4\n\nPAUL E.
