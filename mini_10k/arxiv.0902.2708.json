This suggests that the\ninteractions between proteins and DNA play a role during the target search even far from the specific site. It is\nunclear how these non-specific interactions optimize the search process, and how the protein structure comes\ninto play. Each nucleotide being negatively charged, one may think that the positive surface of DNA-BPs\nshould electrostatically collapse onto DNA. Here we show by means of Monte Carlo simulations and analytical\ncalculations that a counter-intuitive repulsion between the two oppositely charged macromolecules exists at a\nnanometer range. We also show that this repulsion is due to a local increase of the osmotic pressure exerted\nby the ions which are trapped at the interface. For the concave shape of DNA-BPs, and for realistic protein\ncharge densities, we find that the repulsion pushes the protein in a free energy minimum at a distance from\nDNA. As a consequence, a favorable path exists along which proteins can slide without interacting with the\nDNA bases. When a protein encounters its target, the osmotic barrier is completely counter-balanced by the\nH-bond interaction, thus enabling the sequence recognition.\n\nDNA stores the genetic material of all living cells and viruses.\nThis huge amount of information is effective only if DNA binding\nproteins (DNA-BPs) manipulates DNA in very specific locations.\nWhen the protein finds its DNA target, the shape complementarity of DNA Binding Proteins and their specific DNA sequence\nenables to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds, thus leading\nto a strong protein-DNA association [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The rate of\nprotein-DNA association is however not controlled by the association step itself, but by the whole searching process. It is well\nestablished now that DNA-BPs diffuse along DNA before they\nreach their specific site [7]. During this search, the only interactions between protein and DNA which can play a role are non\nsequence-specific. Those non-specific interactions between protein and DNA remain poorly documented. Altough the predominance of electrostatics is unquestionable [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], it remains unclear how the protein structure comes into play [5, 6, 7].\nDoes the typical concavity of DNA-BPs which favors the specific\nassociation also influence the non-specific electrostatic interaction? In DNA-protein complexes, the mean charge of the protein\nresidues located at the interface is positive [1, 2]. Nevertheless,\nstructural studies of non-specific complexes have shown that the\nprotein atoms and the DNA atoms are weakly packed together at\nthe interface [1, 2, 3, 5, 6], thus suggesting that a force counterbalances the electrostatic attraction. In this letter, our purpose is\nto establish the general mechanisms that control the mean force\nbetween protein and DNA and that are applicable to a wide variety of DNA-BPs. That goal in mind, we design coarse-grained\nDNA and protein models, rather than detailed atomic models and\ninvestigate their interactions. First, we prove that a short range repulsion exists when the shape of the protein is complementary to\nthe shape of DNA. Second, we show that this repulsion increases\nwhen the protein charge decreases, and we unravel the underlying physical mechanism. Finally, we discuss in detail why this\nphenomenon is relevant to real biological systems, thanks to statistical data of the protein charge and of the number of H-bonds\nbetween protein and DNA.\nThe most characteristic aspect of DNA-BPs is their shape\ncomplementarity with DNA. As a matter of fact, the concave\n\nDNA-BPs can cover the convex DNA with up to 35% of their\nsurface [1]. At close contact, those interface regions exclude the\nsolvent molecules and form numerous weak bonds with DNA\n(mainly H-bonds [1]). In a first instance, we artificially switch\noff these H-bond interactions. To probe the influence of protein\nshape in controlling the non-specific electrostatic interaction, we\nmonitor changes in the potential of mean force upon modifying\nthe curvature of smooth model proteins along the DNA direction\n(noted Ck ) and in the perpendicular direction (C\u22a5 ) (see Fig. 1a).\nThe charge of all model proteins is given by a single +5e site\nplaced 0.7 nm under the protein surface facing DNA. The direct\nelectrostatic force in vacuum is therefore the same for any protein\nshape investigated here. The DNA is modelled as a hard cylinder\nwith divalent charged sites. The water and the electrolyte ions are\ndescribed by the primitive model of electrolyte solutions [8]. This\nmodel has already been used to explain the less intuitive trends of\nelectrostatic interactions in solution, e.g. the attraction between\nlike-charged particles [9], or the repulsion between charged and\nneutral ones [10]. The relative permittivity of water \u03b5r is taken\nequal to 78.25, and the radius of the salt ions is 0.15 nm.\nThe potential of mean force between a protein and a DNA\nmolecule separated by a distance L is equal to the free energy of\nthe global system (protein, DNA and ions in water). At a fixed\nsurface-to-surface distance L, this energy only depends on the ion\ndistribution. We compute thus the free energy thanks to canonical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations that sample the ion configurations [11, 12]. We voluntarily freeze the rotational degrees of\nfreedom of the protein, and study the interaction for the most attractive orientation, when the protein cavity points toward DNA.\nIndeed, this orientation is the one always observed for specific\nand non-specific complexes, and we observed that the free energy\ngets abruptly more repulsive when the protein rotates. The protein and DNA are placed in a parallelepipedical simulation box\n(275x275x150 nm) with periodic boundaries. The results are reported in Fig. 1b.\nThe curvature Ck slightly influences the range of the interaction, as illustrated by the comparison of spherical and cylindrical proteins. The effect of the curvature C\u22a5 is remarkably more\n\n\f30\n\nB\n\nfree\nT)\nfreeenergy\nenergy (in\nfree\nenergy\n(in units\nunits kkBBT)\nT)\n\n0\n\nfree energy (in units\nkBT)\nkBT units)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n000\n\n20\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n#$!!\n\n-6\n-8\n\n10\n-10\n\n-5\n0\n\nfree energy\nfree energy\n(in units\n(in units\nkBT)kBT)\n\n!\"\n\nF/kBT\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n-5\n\n!\"!!\n1\n\nddd\n\n2\n\nddd\n\nb\n\n0\n\nd\n\n1\n\ne\n\ndd\n\n5\n\nf\n\nd\n\nf\n\nd\n\n-20\n\nv\n\ndd\n\nd\nd\nv\nd\n\n-5\n\na\nv\nab\n\nc\nb\n\n-10\n\nfc\n\na\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n!\"\"\"\n\ndd\nd\nd\n\n0\n\nd\n\n-10\n\n#$\"\"\n\nd\n\n10\n\nd c\n\nsurface to surface\ndistance (nm) b\nddd\n\n0\n\n-5\n-5\n-5\n\n10\n\nd\n\n-10\n\n1\n\na\n\n3\n\nsurface to surface distance\n(nm)\nddd\n-10 0\n\n-10\n\na\nb\nd\n\nddd\n\n15\n\n0\n\nff\nf\n\n1\n2\n0,5\n1,5\nsurface to surface distance L (nm)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n0\n\nfree energy (in units kBT)\n\n30\n\nddd\nsurface to surface\ndistance (nm)\n0 c\n1\n2\nvv\nv\nFIG.\n2: Influence\nofsurface\nthe protein\ncharge\non the interaction.

The free energy as a function of L, whichf is monotonic for C\u22a5 > 0, becomes non-monotonic for C\u22a5 < 0 and exhibits then a minimum Fmin at a distance Lmin . For L < Lmin , there\nis an unexpected repulsive free energy barrier between the oppositely charged bodies, that reaches \u223c 5 kB T in the case of perfectly\nmatching surfaces (C\u22a5 = \u22121/RDNA ). This behavior is weakly influenced by the shape of the remaining surface of the protein: Fmin\nvaries from e.g. \u22124.9 kB T with a cubic protein to \u22125.4 kB T for a\ncylindrical one.\nOnce the role of the protein curvature is established, we perform simulations of concave DNA-BP models with various charge\npatterns to assess the influence of the protein charge on the interaction. When the pattern changes at constant interface charge\ndensity \u03c3prot , the free energy exhibits only minor variations (data\nnot shown). Conversely, \u03c3prot strongly modulates the free energy\nprofile (Fig. 2). For an interface of e.g. 15 nm2 , if \u03c3prot changes\nfrom 0.13|\u03c3DNA | to 0.39|\u03c3DNA |, Fmin dramatically decreases from\n\u22122 kB T to \u221214 kB T and Lmin decreases from 0.75 nm to 0.1 nm.\nTo provide a rational basis to the simulation results, we carry\nout statistical mechanical calculations within the Poisson Boltzmann (PB) framework. The complementary interacting surfaces\n\nment with the MC results, this model predicts a minimum of\nthe free energy, whose depth and position can be analytically\nexpressed [14, 15]. Moreover, we introduce corrections to the\nplate-plate model to account for the actual curvature of protein\nand DNA by rescaling both the interface area Sint and the charge\ndensity. More precisely, the PB free energy is integrated over Sint\nafter projection of each surface element on the plane orthogonal\nto the L axis [16].

To answer this question, we perform a statistical\n10\nanalysis of the protein interface charge densities and complemenL!\ntary surface areas, on a data set of 77 proteins. The charge densities of those proteins are not directly available, but DNA-BPs\n0\n1 nm\n5 are characterized by conserved propensities of charged residues\nat the interface region, as defined in Ref. [18]. For each protein\nL = 0.2 nm!\nL = 0.2 nm!\nprot\nin the data set, we evaluate the total number of residue Ntot , and\n30!\nprot\n0 the number of residue i Ni for the charged residues (i= Arg,\n0Lys, Asp\n0,5 and 1Glu).

We estimate the charge densities of the proteins by approximating the propensity of a residue\nint )/(N prot /N prot ), and this leads to the number of\ni by (Niint /Ntot\ntot\ni\nresidues i at the interface Niint and thus the number of charges. We\n0!\ntake a mean interface area per residue of 0.70 nm2 [19] to derive\nthe mean charge density \u03c3prot . In the case of sequence-specific\nFIG. 3: Ionic density fields.

This repulsion obtained with a coarse-grained model is in agreement with simulations of atomic models of BamHI [20], showing a repulsion when\nthe plates are in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir (\u03bcVT ensemthe concave surface of the protein approaches DNA.\nble). Here, this equilibrium displays two regimes: a counterionTo assess whether this repulsion is still significant after addidominated regime, for which the number of ions between the\ntion of a realistic short-range attraction, we include H-bond inplates is dominated by the counterions neutralizing DNA (N+ \u001d\nteractions and study the resulting free energy as a function of\nN\u2212 ), and a salt-dominated regime (N+ \u2212 N\u2212 \u001c N\u2212 ). It is estabthe protein position z along the sequence and the distance L belished that the salt-dominated regime is attractive, because the\ntween the surfaces.

Interestingly, along the equilibrium valley, the roughness of the sequence-dependent part of the potential is screened out: The protein can therefore easily slide along\nDNA. At the target site, the large H-bond interaction significantly\nreduces the barrier, and the protein can approach the DNA.\nOur results unravel a subtle balance between long-range electrostatic attraction, short-range osmotic repulsion and short-range\nattraction. This effect is sensitive to the shape and charge of DNABPs, and should have thus contributed to the structural evolution\nof those proteins. From a dynamical perspective, our model provides new bases to conciliate the dual requirement of high protein mobility and high sequence sensitivity [23, 24, 25]. Indeed,\nthe latter is usually assumed to slow down the protein diffusion\n[26, 27]. According to our results, the DNA-BP freely diffuses\nalong non-specific DNA, confined in an electrostatic free energy\nvalley. The free energy barrier, which keeps the protein at a\ndistance from DNA, is also a signature of the sequence: Transverse thermal fluctuations enable the protein to cross the barrier\nonly at the specific site or at highly homologous sequences. This\nrecognition mechanism is efficient because it does not require the\nprotein to probe the molecular details of non-specific DNA se-\n\n[1] S. Jones, P. van Heyningen, H.M. Berman, and J.M.
