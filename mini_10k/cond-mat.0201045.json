This\neffect is particularly important in the case of quasibrittle materials which are characterized by the existence of a\nlarge fracture process zone containing many damage microcracks. Materials as different as concretes, mortar and\nrocks, some composites, toughened ceramics and wood belong to this category. Ba\u017eant1,2 has shown that in this case,\ncontrary to what happens for Weibull's statistics3 , the size effect is linked to the very existence of the development of\nsuch a large microcracked zone, which implies stress redistributions and stored energy release.\nOn the other hand, in quasibrittle materials, damage has a strong influence on the local deviations of the main\ncrack through its elastic interactions with the microcracks4\u20136 . Consequently, the roughness of the fracture surfaces\ncan be considered as an inheritance of the damage process and it is naturally tempting to correlate their morphology\n(and especially their fractal properties) to macroscopic mechanical properties such as fracture energy or fracture\ntoughness7\u201313 .\nIn this paper, on the basis of a link recently established13 between the roughening of crack surfaces and the\nmacroscopic energy released during crack propagation (this work is summarized in Section II), we propose an energybased asymptotic analysis in Section III which allows to extend this link to the nominal strength of large (Sec. III A)\nand small (Sec. III B) structures. An approximate size effect valid everywhere is proposed in Sec. III C. This\nprediction is shown to be in agreement with experimental results obtained on wood Sec. IV. Finally, we discuss\nmaterial-dependent properties in Sec. V.\nII. SCALING LAWS OF CRACK SURFACES AND ENERGY RELEASE RATE\n\nThe statistical characterization of the fractal morphology of fracture surfaces is nowadays a very active field of\nresearch. It is now well established that these surfaces, for very different types of materials (from ductile aluminium\nalloys14,15 to brittle materials like rock17,16,18 or wood19,20 ), exhibit self-affine scaling properties in a large range of\nlengthscales (see21 for a more detailed account of experiments). Moreover, in addition to this self-affine character,\nrecent studies focussed on the complete description (3D) of the morphology of crack surfaces18,20 have shown that\nthe scaling laws governing the crack developments in longitudinal and transverse directions are different and material\ndependent20 .\nLet us consider the development of a fracture surface from a straight notch of length L with zero roughness.\nThe mean plane of the crack surface is defined as (x, y) where the x axis is perpendicular to the direction of crack\npropagation and the y axis is parallel to this direction. For two quasibrittle materials (granite18 and wood20 ), it has\nbeen found that the fluctuations \u2206h of the height on the fracture surfaces, estimated over a window of size l along\nthe x axis and at a distance y from the initial notch exhibited anomalous scaling properties which are quite similar\nto those obtained in some models of nonequilibrium kinetic roughening22,23 :\n\u001a \u03b6\nl loc \u03be(y)\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc if l \u226a \u03be(y)\n\u2206h(l, y) \u2243 A\n(1)\n\u03be(y)\u03b6\nif l \u226b \u03be(y)\nwhere \u03be(y) = By 1/z depends on the distance y to the initial notch and characterizes a crossover length along the x\naxis. For length scales smaller than \u03be(y), the surface is self-affine, and characterized by the local roughness exponent\n1\n\n\f\u03b6loc . This self-affine character is observed in most experiments and a local roughness exponent \u03b6loc \u2243 0.8 is reported in\nall cases. Hence, it has been suggested that this local roughness exponent might be a universal index, i.e. independent\nof the fracture mode and of the material15 .\nAccording to Eq. (1), the magnitude of the roughness increases as a function of the distance y until the self-affine\ncorrelation length \u03be(y) reaches the system size L. This happens at a certain distance ysat = (L/B)z from the notch:\n\u03be(y \u226b ysat ) = L. Thus, the first growth regime of the roughness (i.e. for y \u226a ysat ) is followed by a stationary regime\n(for y \u226b ysat ) where the magnitude of the roughness remains constant and where the global roughness (i.e. measured\nover the system size L) is driven by the global roughness exponent \u03b6: \u2206h(L, y \u226b ysat ) \u223c L\u03b6 . The main consequence of\nan anomalous scaling [Eq. (1)] is that, in this stationary regime, the magnitude of the local roughness (i.e. measured on\nwindows l \u226a L) is not only a function of the window size l but also of the system size L: \u2206h(l, y \u226b ysat ) \u223c l\u03b6loc L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc .\nExperimental results obtained on quasibrittle materials have shown the following values for the global roughness\nexponent: \u03b6 = 1.2 for granite18 and 1.35 and 1.60 for wood (pine and spruce respectively)20 . Note that the exponent\nz (called the \"dynamic exponent\") and the prefactors A and B seem also to be material-dependent20 .\nThe Family-Vicsek scaling law24 , where the height fluctuations \u2206h scale as:\n\u001a \u03b6\nl loc\nif l \u226a \u03be(y)\n\u2206h(l, y) \u2243 A\n(2)\n\u03be(y)\u03b6loc if l \u226b \u03be(y)\ncan be seen as a particular case of the anomalous scaling [Eq. (1)] where \u03b6 = \u03b6loc . In this case [Eq. (2)], the magnitudes\nof the local and global roughnesses at saturation, respectively \u2206h(l, y \u226b ysat ) \u223c l\u03b6loc and \u2206h(L, y \u226b ysat ) \u223c L\u03b6loc ,\nare driven by the same roughness exponent (the local roughness exponent \u03b6loc ). Furthermore, the local roughness\nis independent of the system size. This is drastically different from what happens in the case of an anomalous\nscaling. It is worth noticing that both the Family-Vicsek and the anomalous scaling laws were used to describe\nthe roughness development of the same granite fracture surface17,18 , and that more accurate results were obtained\nassuming anomalous scaling18 .\nThe anomalous and Family-Vicsek scalings were recently shown to be linked to drastically different mechanical\nbehaviors in terms of elastic energy release13 . Within the framework of an equivalent linear elastic problem, a\nfracture criterion, linking the elastic energy release rate G at the macroscale and the fractal nature of the crack at the\nmicroscale, was proposed: G = 2\u03b3 \u03c8(y)/L. In this fracture criterion, \u03b3 is the so-called specific surface energy and the\nratio \u03c8(y)/L can be considered as a \"roughness factor\". As a matter of fact, it is precisely the ratio of the length of a\nvirtual crack front over its projected length L (the system size, i.e. the specimen width). This virtual front, parallel\nto the initial notch, is assumed to be rough only out of the average fracture plane (x, y), and this roughness can be\ndefined from the functions \u2206h(l, y) at a fixed position y from the initial notch.\nAccording to an anomalous scaling [Eq. (1)], the estimate of the real length \u03c8 of the virtual front (which corresponds\nto the length of a self-affine curve13 ) leads to the following expressions of the energy release rate:\n\uf8f1r\n\u0010 \u03b6\u2212\u03b6 \u00112\n\uf8f4\nloc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1 + AB1\u2212\u03b6loc\n\u2206a2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/z if \u2206a \u226a \u2206asat\nlo\nr\nGR (\u2206a) \u2243 2\u03b3\n(3)\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nA\n2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\n\uf8f3 1+\nL\nif\n\u2206a\n\u226b\n\u2206a\nsat\nl 1\u2212\u03b6loc\no\n\nwhere the crack length increments \u2206a and \u2206asat defined from the initial notch correspond respectively to the crack\npositions y and ysat defined in Eq. (1). In the zone where the roughness grows, i.e. for \u2206a \u226a \u2206asat , the fracture\nequilibrium leads to an energy release rate function of the crack length increment \u2206a [Eq. (3)]. The subscript R in\nGR emphasizes the fact that the resistance to fracture growth is similar to the behavior described by a resistance\ncurve (usually called R-curve6). Note that the square root terms in Eq. (3) are dimensionless and correspond to the\nroughness factor \u03c8(y)/L. The term lo is the lower cutoff of the fractal range of the virtual front (i.e. the characteristic\nsize of the smaller microstructural element relevant for the fracture process). When the crack increment is large,\ni.e. for \u2206a \u226b \u2206asat [Eq. (3)] which corresponds to the saturation state of the roughness, the resistance to fracture\ngrowth becomes independent of the crack length increment because the self-affine correlation length has reached the\nsystem size: \u03be(\u2206a \u226b \u2206asat ) \u2243 L. Introducing the crossover length LC = (lo 1\u2212\u03b6loc /A)1/(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc ) , the resistance to crack\ngrowth for large crack length increments becomes:\ns\n\u00132(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\n\u0012\nL\nGR (\u2206a \u226b \u2206asat ) \u2243 GRC \u2243 2\u03b3 1 +\n(4)\nLC\nwhere the subscript C in GRC emphasizes that the resistance to crack growth has reached an asymptotic or critical\nvalue. The main consequence of the link between fracture mechanics and anomalous roughening of fracture surfaces13\n2\n\n\fis the size effect on the critical resistance to crack growth [Eq. (4)]. This size effect is the result of the dependence of\nthe maximum magnitude of the roughness at saturation on the structure size L. As shown in Fig. 1, the size effect\naffecting the critical resistance GRC exhibits two asymptotic behaviors separated by the crossover length LC . For\nsmall structure sizes (i.e. L \u226a LC ) where the roughness of the fracture surface is weak, there is no size effect, and\nGRC \u2243 2\u03b3. For large structure sizes (i.e. L \u226b LC ), corresponding to an important fracture roughness, the critical\nresistance evolves as a power law : GRC \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc .\nIn the case of the Family-Vicsek scaling [Eq. (2)], on the contrary, the link between roughnening of fracture surfaces\nand material fracture properties13 reduces to a resistance to crack growth independent of the crack increment \u2206a and\nof the specimen size L:\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nA\n(5)\nGC (\u2206a) \u2243 2 \u03b3 1 +\nlo 1\u2212\u03b6loc\nThus, an anomalous scaling accounts for an R-curve behavior and a size effect on the critical resistance to crack\ngrowth while a Family-Vicsek scaling reflects a purely elastic brittle fracture behavior.\nIII. SIZE EFFECT ON THE NOMINAL STRENGTH\n\nWe now extend the connection just summarized13 to the nominal strength of structures.\nWithin the framework of Ba\u017eant's theory25 , the size effect (for two-dimensional problem) can be described from\ngeometrically similar structures of different sizes (with geometrically similar initial cracks or notches) by introducing\na nominal stress:\n\u03c3N =\n\nP\ndL\n\n(6)\n\nwhere P is the external load applied to the structure (considered to be a load independent of the displacement), L is\nthe characteristic size of the structure, and d is any length of the structure (for instance, as shown in Fig. 2 in the\ncase of TDCB specimens, d corresponds to the ligament length). When P = Pu which corresponds to the ultimate or\nmaximum load, \u03c3N is called the nominal strength of the structure.\nOn the other hand, at the maximum load Pu , the elastic energy release rate G (obtained at a constant load Pu\nor \u03c3N ) must be equal, according to the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), to the critical resistance to crack\ngrowth GRC :\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2202W \u2217\n= GRC\n(7)\nG=\nL \u2202a \u03c3N\nwhere the complementary energy W \u2217 characterizes the energy stored in the structure. This energy W \u2217 can be written\nin the following form: W \u2217 = \u03c3N 2 L d 2 f (\u03b1)/E where f is a dimensionless function characterizing the geometry of the\nstructure and \u03b1 = a/d is the relative crack length. Thus, when the maximum load is reached, the nominal strength\nof the structure can also be written as:\ns\nE GRC\n\u03c3N =\n(8)\nd g(\u03b1)\nwhere g(\u03b1) = \u2202f (\u03b1)/\u2202\u03b1 corresponds to the dimensionless energy release rate function.\nUsually, the main problem with Eq. (8) is to determine the relative crack length \u03b1 = a/d for which the maximum\nload Pu is reached. Let us consider exclusively a structure of \"positive geometry\", i.e. \u2202g(\u03b1)/\u2202\u03b1 > 0 under load\ncontrol.\nIf the material exhibits a purely elastic brittle behavior such as the one obtained for a Family-Vicsek scaling [Eq.\n(5)], the relative crack length increment \u03b1 at the maximum load corresponds to \u03b1o = ao /d (ao being the length of the\nnotch or initial crack). Thus, in the case of a Family-Vicsek scaling, replacing the resistance to crack growth GC by\nits expression in [Eq. 5] and \u03b1 by \u03b1o in Eq. (8), we obtain the following size effect relation:\nv\n\"\nu\n\u0012\n\u00132 #1/2\nu 2\u03b3E\nA\nt\n\u03c3N =\n1+\nL\u22121/2\n(9)\nmg(\u03b1o )\nlo 1\u2212\u03b6loc\n3\n\n\fwhere m is a proportionality coefficient between d and L (d = mL). In Eq.(9), the term under the square root is a\nconstant, which means that the nominal strength of structures evolves as \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2 . This is in agreement with the\nexpected LEFM size effect, i.e. the size effect of a purely elastic brittle fracture behavior.\nIn the case of an anomalous scaling, the problem appears more complicated. Indeed, under the conditions evoked\nin the previous case (i.e., structures of positive geometry and under load control), if the material exhibits an R-curve\nbehavior [Eq. (3)], the crack length increment \u2206asat (limit of the R-curve) is actually the limit of stability. Thus,\nthe relative crack length at the maximum load can be defined as \u03b1 = \u03b1o + \u03b8 where \u03b8 = \u2206asat /d. Hence, in the case\nof an anomalous scaling, which reflects the fracture behavior of quasibrittle materials, the knowledge of the evolution\nof the crack length increment \u2206asat as a function of the structure size is the key of the size effect problem. However,\nthe dependence between \u2206asat and the specimen size does not appear clearly from the roughness analysis18,20 .\nIn order to resolve this problem - which is the central point of this paper -, a possible way suggested by Ba\u017eant25\nconsists in considering that the failure of a quasibrittle material is not only characterized by the specific surface\nenergy 2\u03b3 (related to the actual crack surface), but also by a critical damage energy release rate Gd per unit volume\nof damaged material (i.e. per unit volume of fracture process zone). Thus, one can assume that failure at the maximum\nload is obtained for the energy balance:\nGd VF P Z = 2\u03b3 Ar (\u2206asat )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the volume of the fracture process zone can be estimated as VF P Z = L \u2206asat 2 /n with L\u2206asat the projected\ncrack surface and \u2206asat /n the height of the process zone (where n is assumed constant, i.e. independent of the\nsize L). The surface Ar (\u2206asat ) corresponds to the real fracture surface produced during the crack advance \u2206asat .\nNote that the fracture criterion [Eq. (10)] actually corresponds to an equivalent linear elastic problem25,26 where the\neffective size of the fracture process zone at the maximum load is assumed equal to the crack length increment for\nwhich the resistance to crack growth does not follow the R-curve [Eq. (3)] but remains constant and equal to the\ncritical resistance: GR (\u2206asat ) = GRC [Eq. (4)].\nIn the following, on the basis of the fracture criterion defined in Eq. (10), the asymptotic values of \u2206asat are\nestimated for large and small structures in order to obtain the nominal strength respectively for large and small-size\nasymptotic expansions.\nA. Large-size asymptotic expansion of the size effect\n\nAs previously mentioned, the square root terms in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) correspond to the ratio of the virtual\ncrack front length \u03c8(\u2206a) over its projected length L. Moreover, from Eq. (4), relative to the roughness saturation\np regime, one can obtain the maximum length of the virtual crack front since \u03c8(\u2206a \u226b \u2206asat ) \u2243 \u03c8max \u2243\nL 1 + (L/LC )2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc ) 13 . Thus, for large structure sizes, i.e. L \u226b LC , the asymptotic value of the real crack surface\nAr produced for a crack advance \u2206asat can be estimated from \u03c8max as: Ar \u2243 \u03b2 L \u2206asat (L/LC )\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc where \u03b2 is a\nconstant (function of the scaling exponents). Substituting Ar in Eq. (10) yields the expression of the crack length\nincrement:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc\nL\n\u2217\n\u2206asat = c \u03b2\n(11)\nLC\nwhere c\u2217 = n2\u03b3/Gd is a material-dependent length scale. Thus, for large structure sizes, the relative size of the\nfracture process zone (i.e. \u03b8 = \u2206asat /d) is expected to evolve as a power law \u03b8 \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc \u22121 . Moreover, from the\nvalues of the scaling exponents obtained in the roughness analysis of quasibrittle materials18,20 , it appears that the\nrelative size of the process zone becomes negligible when the system size increases: lim \u03b8 = 0 for L \u2192 +\u221e. In other\nterms, in large structures, the process zone is expected to lie within only an infinitesimal volume fraction of the body\nand so lim \u03b1 = \u03b1o for L \u2192 +\u221e. Note that this result is in agreement with Ba\u017eant's assumption25 . Hence, the\ndimensionless energy release rate function g(\u03b1) being generally a smooth function, we may expand it into a Taylor\nseries around \u03b1 = \u03b1o and Eq.(8) thus yields :\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u03b82\n\u03b83\nE GRC\ng(\u03b1o ) + g1 (\u03b1o ) \u03b8 + g2 (\u03b1o )\n+ g3 (\u03b1o )\n+ ...\n\u03c3N =\n(12)\nd\n2!\n3!\nv\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nu\n\u0001\nu\nL 2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\nu\n1\n+\nLC\nu\n(13)\n= \u03c3M t\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u00012 L \u00013(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\n2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\nL \u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc\nL\n+ b3 LL1\n+ ...\n+ b2 LL1 LLC\nL1 + LC\nLC\n4\n\n\fwhere g1 (\u03b1o ) = \u2202g(\u03b1o )/\u2202\u03b1, g2 (\u03b1o ) =\n3\ng(\u03b1o )2 g3 (\u03b1o )/(6g1 (\u03b1o ) ), ..., and,\ns\n\u03c3M =\n\n\u2202 2 g(\u03b1o )/\u2202\u03b12 , ...,\n\n2\u03b3E\n,\nmg(\u03b1o )L1\n\nL 1 = c\u2217\n\nand b2\n\n=\n\ng(\u03b1o )g2 (\u03b1o )/(2g1 (\u03b1o )2 ),\n\n\u03b2 g1 (\u03b1o )\nm g(\u03b1o )\n\nb3\n\n=\n\n(14)\n\nare all constants. Equation (13) provides a large-size asymptotic series expansion of the size effect because the terms\ncontaining non zero powers of L in denominator vanish for L \u2192 \u221e. Note that Eq. (13) is expected to diverge for\nstructure sizes L \u2192 0 as shown in Fig. 3. A first-order asymptotic approximation at large sizes can be obtained by\ntruncating the series after the linear term:\nv\n\u00131/2\nu\u0012\n\u0001\nu\nu 1 + L 2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\nLC\nu\n(15)\n\u03c3N = \u03c3M t\n\u0001\nL\nL \u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc\nL1 + LC\n\nThe main consequence of the anomalous roughening in the case of large structure sizes is that the nominal strength is\nexpected to decrease as \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2+(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/2 (as shown in Fig. 3). This result disagrees with the size effect proposed\nby Ba\u017eant25 where the nominal strength of large structures decreases as \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2 which is the theoretical size\neffect of LEFM. The difference originates in the fact that, for an anomalous roughening, the critical resistance to\ncrack growth GRC [Eq. (4)] is expected to evolve as a power law GRC \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc for large structure sizes while in\nLEFM, the critical resistance GRC is assumed to be constant (i.e. independant of the specimen size). Hence, the size\neffect on the nominal strength obtained for an anomalous roughening is weaker than the size effect in LEFM.\nB. Small-size asymptotic expansion of the size effect\n\nIn Ba\u017eant's theory25 , no size effect is expected for small structure sizes (L \u2192 0); this is the domain of the strength\ntheory. A possible justification is that, in small structures, the fracture process zone fills the whole volume of the\nstructure and hence, there is no stress concentration and, as a consequence, failure occurs with no crack propagation.\nSuch an argument can be also obtained from the link between anomalous roughening of crack surfaces and material\nfracture properties. Indeed, in small structure sizes (i.e. L \u226a LC ), the roughness being negligible, the virtual\ncrack front length tends to its projected length L. This implies that, for small structures, the actual crack surfaces\nproduced during a crack advance \u2206asat are not so different from the projected one: Ar \u2243 L\u2206asat . Hence, substituting\nAr \u2243 L\u2206asat into the fracture criterion [Eq. (10)] yields the crack length increment: \u2206asat = n2\u03b3/Gd = c\u2217 for\nL \u226a LC . In other terms, the effective size of the process zone tends to the material length for small structure sizes.\nThus, when the material length c\u2217 = d \u2212 ao (Fig. 2), the fracture process zone occupies the entire ligament of the\nstructure.\nOn the basis of Ba\u017eant's theory25 and in order to obtain a small-size asymptotic expansion of the size effect, let us\nnow introduce a new variable and a new function:\n\u03b7=\n\n1\nd\n,\n=\n\u03b8\n\u2206asat\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1o , \u03b7) =\n\ng(\u03b1o + \u03b8)\n= \u03b7 g(\u03b1o + 1/\u03b7)\n\u03b8\n\n(16)\n\nThe function \u03c6(\u03b1o , \u03b7) corresponds to the dimensionless energy release rate function of the inverse relative size of the\nprocess zone. Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (8) and expanding \u03c6(\u03b1o , \u03b7) into Taylor series around the point (\u03b1o , 0)\nsince lim \u03b7 = 0 when d or L \u2192 0, yields the nominal strength:\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121/2\nE GRC\n\u03b72\n\u03b73\n\u03c3N =\n\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0) + \u03c61 (\u03b1o , 0) \u03b7 + \u03c62 (\u03b1o , 0)\n+ \u03c63 (\u03b1o , 0)\n+ ...\n(17)\nc\u2217\n2!\n3!\nv\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nu\n\u0001\nu\nL 2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\nu\n1\n+\nLC\nu\n(18)\n= \u03c3M \u2032 t\n\u00012\n\u00013\n+ c3 LL2\n+ ...\n1 + LL2 + c2 LL2\n\nwhere \u03c61 (\u03b1o , 0) = \u2202\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)/\u2202\u03b7, \u03c62 (\u03b1o , 0) = \u2202 2 \u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)/\u2202\u03b72 , ..., and c2 = \u03c62 (\u03b1o , 0)\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)2 /(2\u03c61 (\u03b1o , 0)2 ), c3 =\n3\n\u03c63 (\u03b1o , 0)\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)3 /(6\u03c61 (\u03b1o , 0) ), ..., and,\n5\n\n\f\u03c3M \u2032 =\n\ns\n\n2\u03b3E\n,\n\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)c\u2217\n\nL 2 = c\u2217\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1o , 0)\nm \u03c61 (\u03b1o , 0)\n\n(19)\n\nare all constants. Equation (18) provides a small-size asymptotic series expansion of the size effect and is plotted\nin Fig. 3. When L \u2192 0, the nominal strength tends to a constant (i.e. \u03c3M \u2032 as expected in the case of a strength\ntheory25 ) but diverges from the asymptotic behavior of the size effect obtained in the case of large structure sizes [Eq.\n(13)].\nC. Approximate size effect\n\nNow, the main problem consists in interpolating between the large-size [Eq. (13)] and the small-size [Eq. (18)]\nasymptotic series expansion in order to obtain an approximate size effect valid everywhere. The theory of intermediate\nasymptotics27 is not easily applicable in our case. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe in Fig. 3 that a satisfactory\napproximate size effect can be obtained by truncating the small-size asymptotic series expansion [Eq. (18)] after the\nlinear term:\nv\nu\u0012\n\u00131/2\nu\n\u0001\nu 1 + L 2(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )\nu\nLC\n\u03c3N = \u03c3max t\n(20)\n1 + LLo\n\nwhere the contants \u03c3max and Lo will be discussed in what follows. Indeed, Eq. (20) allows to obtain the transition\nbetween a horizontal asymptote characterizing the strength theory for which there is no size effect, and a decreasing\nasymptote, corresponding to a power law of exponent: \u22121/2 + (\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6loc )/2 for large structure sizes. A possible\njustification is that, in the large-size first-order expansion [Eq. (15)], the second term in numerator has no influence\non the power law \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2+(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/2 for large sizes but induces a divergence at small sizes.\nOne limitation of the approximate size effect is that in Eq. (20), the values of \u03c3M and \u03c3M \u2032 , and the values of L1\nand L2 , are assumed to be equal and respectively characterized by \u03c3max and Lo . Indeed, the estimate of these values\nwould be surely different from large size data or from small size data. Thus, the approximate size effect only gives\nthe shape of the size effect relation on the nominal strength but does not allow for a determination of the parameter\nvalues \u03c3max and Lo . Only the crossover length LC and the scaling exponents \u03b6loc and \u03b6 are univocally determined\nfrom the roughness analysis. However, it seems reasonnable to assume that the difference between \u03c3M and \u03c3M \u2032 will\nbe masked by the scatter of the experimental data. On the other hand, it seems difficult to compare the crossover\nlengths L1 and L2 (characterized by Lo in Eq. (20)) to the crossover length LC using their analytical expressions,\nbecause the former is deduced from a mechanical approach and the latter from a roughness analysis. Nevertheless,\nfrom a physical point of view, both have the same meaning. For small structure sizes, i.e. L \u226a LC or Lo , the energy\nreleased by the structure is negligible, while for large sizes, i.e. L \u226b LC or Lo , the energy released is dominant. Hence,\nit seems reasonnable to assume that both crossover lengths are of the same order of magnitude (it is the case in Fig.\n3 where it is assumed that Lo = LC ).\nIV. EXPERIMENT\n\nIn the following the experimental setup of mode I fracture tests on a quasibrittle material, wood, is described.\nTwo wood species have been tested: Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait ) and Norway spruce (Picea Abies L.). The\naverage oven dry specific densities were respectively 0.55 and 0.40 and the moisture content of all specimens was\nmeasured between 11 and 13 %. Tests were made on modified tapered double cantilever beam specimens (TDCB)\noriented along the longitudinal-tangential directions of wood (Fig. 2). Six sets of geometrically similar specimens\ncharacterized by their width L = 7.5, 11.3, 15.0, 22.5, 30.0 and 60.0 mm have been used. A straight notch is machined\nwith a band saw (thickness 2 mm) and prolonged a few millimeters with a razor blade (thickness 0.2 mm). Fracture\nis obtained through uniaxial tension at a constant opening rate. The fracture surfaces are generated along the average\nlongitudinal-radial plane of wood. Load-deflection values were continuously recorded during the tests.\nThe roughness analysis20 , performed from these fracture tests, has shown an anomalous roughening [Eq. (1)] of the\ncrack surfaces driven by the global and local roughness exponents, \u03b6 = 1.35 \u00b1 0.10 and \u03b6loc = 0.88 \u00b1 0.07 in the case\nof pine, and, \u03b6 = 1.60 \u00b1 0.10 and \u03b6loc = 0.87 \u00b1 0.07 in the case of spruce. Hence, the experimental R-curve behaviors\nand the size effects on critical energy release rates and nominal strengths should be described respectively by Eq. (3),\nEq. (4) and Eq. (20).\n6\n\n\fFrom an equivalent linear elastic approach (which is the frame of the model described in Sec. II and Sec.III) where\nthe crack lengths can be estimated from the unloading compliance of the specimens , the elastic energy release rate\nGR are computed from the load-deflection curves for any crack length increment \u2206a. Two examples of the energy\nrelease rate evolution GR as a function of the crack length extension \u2206a obtained for both wood species and for\na specimen size L = 11.3 mm are given in Fig. 4. An R-curve behavior is observed for both wood species, i.e. a\npronounced evolution of the resistance to crack growth as a function of the equivalent crack length increment6 . After\na characteristic propagation distance (\u2206asat \u2243 23 mm for pine (a) and 40 mm for spruce (b)) which corresponds\napproximately to the ultimate load Pu , the energy release rate becomes independent of the crack length increment\n\u2206a. The post R-curve behavior arises at constant resistance to crack growth and corresponds to critical resistance\nGRC . In Figure 4 the R-curves and post R-curve behaviors are fitted with the Eq. (3). These fits are obtained in\nkeeping three free parameters: the specific surface energy \u03b3, the ratio A/lo 1\u2212\u03b6loc and the scaling exponent (\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6loc )/z.\nThe expected R-curve behavior [Eq. (3)] provides a good description of the increase of the experimental resistances to\ncrack growth. For both wood species, the fitted exponents (\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6loc )/z are close to those measured from the roughness\nanalysis20 which are given in brackets in Fig. 4. Note that the R-curve is more pronouced in pine than in spruce\n(i.e. the critical energy release rate GRC is greater for a smaller crack length increment \u2206asat than in spruce). This\ntrend has also been observed for the other specimen sizes L.\nOn the other hand, for both wood species, it has been shown that the sizes L of tested specimens were greater\nthan the crossover lengths LC 13 [defined in Eq.(4) and Eq. (20) relative to the size effect]. Thus, according to Eq.\n(4) and for L \u226b LC , the size effect on the critical energy release rates of both wood species is expected to evolve as\na power law: GRC \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc . The critical energy release rates obtained for both wood species are plotted in Fig. 5\nversus the characteristic specimen sizes L. Experimental size effects are fitted by a power law GRC (L) \u223c L\u03b2 whose\nthe exponents \u03b2 = 0.42 for pine (a) and \u03b2 = 0.64 for spruce (b) are in fair agreement with the expected exponents\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6loc = 0.47 \u00b1 0.17 for pine (a) and 0.73 \u00b1 0.17 for spruce (b). Note that the size effect on critical energies of spruce\nis stronger than the one obtained for pine.\nIn the same way, in Fig. 6, the nominal strengths \u03c3N obtained for both wood species are plotted versus the\ncharacteristic specimen sizes L. According to Eq. (20) and, as previously mentioned for L \u226b LC , the size effect\non nominal strengths is expected to evolve as: \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2+(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/2 . Note that latter asymptotic behaviour is\nobtained with the assumption Lo = LC in Eq. (20) as previously discussed in Sec III C. As shown in Fig. 6, simple\npower law fits of the experimental nominal strengths give exponent which are in good agreement with those expected,\ni.e. \u2212 21 + \u03b6\u2212\u03b62loc = \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.09 for pine (a) and \u22120.14 \u00b1 0.09 for spruce (b). By comparison of the size effects on the\ncritical energy release rates and on the nominal strengths it is appeared that, as expected intuitively, the more the\nsize effect on critical energies is important the more the size effect on nominal strengths is weak.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFrom an energy-based analysis, a link between the scaling laws describing the fracture surfaces and the size effect\non the nominal strength of the structures is proposed. On the basis of a Family-Vicsek scaling, which has been shown\nto reflect a purely elastic brittle fracture behavior13 , the size effect obtained is in agreement with the classical size\neffect of linear elastic fracture mechanics: \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2 [Eq. (9)]. In the case of an anomalous scaling, reflecting the\nfracture behavior of quasibrittle materials13 , an asymptotic analysis allows to estimate the size effect relation on the\nnominal strength, and especially, the crack length increment for which the maximum load is reached. From large-size\nand small-size asymptotic series expansion of the size effect, an approximate size effect [Eq. (20)] of general validity\nis proposed. This relation represents a smooth transition from the case of no size effect, for small structure sizes, to a\npower law size effect which appears weaker than the size effect of LEFM. Thus, in the case of quasibrittle materials,\nthe approximate size effect relation [Eq. (20)] is different from the classical size effect law proposed by Ba\u017eant25\nand especially for large structure sizes where an asymptotic behavior \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2+(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/2 is predicted instead\nof the size effect of LEFM suggested by Ba\u017eant's theory. The difference can be explained by the fact that, for an\nanomalous scaling of fracture surfaces, the critical resistance to crack growth at the maximum load evolves as a power\nlaw GRC \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc for large structure sizes while this resistance is assumed to be constant in LEFM. Experiments\nperformed on geometrically similar wood specimens of various sizes, for which anomalous roughening of crack surfaces\nhas been observed previously20 , show that the size effects on the critical resistances and on the nominal strengths are\nin fair agreement with the predicted asymptotic behaviors GRC \u223c L\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc and \u03c3N \u223c L\u22121/2+(\u03b6\u2212\u03b6loc )/2 . On the other\nhand, if one considers a weakly anomalous roughening of the fracture surfaces (i.e. \u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6loc ), R-curve [Eq. (3)] and\nsize effect on the critical resistance [Eq. (4)] vanish progressively and as a consequence, the size effect characteristic\nof a quasibrittle material [Eq. (20)] tends to the classical size effect of a purely elastic brittle material [Eq. (9)].\nExperiments on different kinds of quasi-brittle materials are currently being performed to test our predictions.\n\n7\n\n\f1\n\nZ.P. Ba\u017eant, J. Eng. Mech. 110, 518 (1984).\nZ.P.
