The FLS was designed to\ncharacterize the mid-infrared sky at depths 2 orders of magnitude deeper than previous surveys.\nThe extragalactic component is the first cosmological survey done with Spitzer. Source catalogs\nextracted from the R-band images are also presented. The R-band images were obtained using\nthe MOSAIC-1 camera on the Mayall 4m telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Two\nrelatively large regions of the sky were observed to modest depth: the main FLS extra galactic field (17h 18m 00s +59o 30\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 .0 J2000; l= 88.3, b= +34.9) and ELAIS-N1 field (16h 10m 01s\n+54o30\u2032 36\u2032\u2032 .0 J2000; l= 84.2, b= +44.9). While both of these fields were in early plans for the\nFLS, only a single deep pointing test observation was made at the ELAIS-N1 location. The larger\nLegacy program SWIRE (Lonsdale et al., 2003) will include this region among its surveyed areas.\nThe data products of our KPNO imaging (images and object catalogs) are made available to the\ncommunity through the World Wide Web (via the Spitzer Science Center and NOAO Science\nArchives). The overall quality of the images is high. The measured positions of sources detected\nin the images have RMS uncertainties in their absolute positions of order 0.35 arc-seconds with\npossible systematic offsets of order 0.1 arc-seconds, depending on the reference frame of comparison. The relative astrometric accuracy is much better than 0.1 of an arc-second. Typical\ndelivered image quality in the images is 1.1 arc-seconds full width at half maximum. Images\nare relatively deep since they reach a median 5\u03c3 depth limiting magnitude of R=25.5 (Vega), as\nmeasured within a 1.35 \u00d7 FWHM aperture for which the S/N ratio is maximal. Catalogs have\nbeen extracted using SExtractor using thresholds in area and flux for which the number of false\ndetections is below 1% at R=25. Only sources with S/N greater than 3 have been retained in\nthe final catalogs. Comparing the galaxy number counts from our images with those of deeper\nR-band surveys, we estimate that our observations are 50% complete at R=24.5. These limits in\ndepth are sufficient to identify a substantial fraction of the infrared sources which will be detected\nby Spitzer.\nSubject headings: astronomical data bases:catalogs - galaxies: photometry\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nsurveys of large regions of the sky in a relatively\nshort time covering wavelengths from the near-IR\nto the far-IR with the instruments IRAC (Fazio\net al. 1998) and MIPS (Rieke et al. 1996). Compared to Spitzer's predecessors (e.g. IRAS, Soifer\net al. 1983, and ISO, Kessler et al. 1996), there are\nimprovements in the detectors (number of pixels\nand better responsivity), the collecting area of the\nprimary mirror (85cm diameter), and Sun-EarthMoon avoidance constraints due Spitzer's helio-\n\nOne of the main advantages of the Spitzer Space\nTelescope (formerly known as the Space Infrared\nInfrared Telescope Facility; SIRTF, Gallagher et\nal. 2003) is the possibility to make extragalactic\n1 Spitzer Science Center, California Institute of Technology, MS 220-6, Pasadena, CA 91125\n2 National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Tucson, AZ\n85719\n\n1\n\n\fpute photometric redshifts (e.g. the NOAO Deep\nWide-Field Survey, Jannuzi and Dey 1999, Brown\net al. 2003), the task of deeply covering a large\nregion of sky in a homogeneous manner is quite\ntime-consuming. Therefore, for the initial optical ancillary survey we chose to observe the entire\nfield in the R-band. NOAO provided 4 nights of\nDirector's Discretionary time on the KPNO 4m\nin May, 2000, for this survey. We have limited\nmulti-wavelength optical observations to the central portion of the FLS field. The Sloan Digital\nSky Survey included the FLS field in their early\nrelease observations (Stoughton et al. 2002) and\nmosaics and catalogs for the region are also now\navailable (Hogg et al. 2004).\nIn this paper, we present the R-band optical observations made with the MOSAIC-1 camera on\nthe Mayall 4m Telescope of Kitt Peak National\nObservatory. Centered on the main FLS field, a\nregion 9.4 square degrees in area was imaged. In\naddition, 2.3 square degrees covering the ELAISN1 field was also observed. Although originally\nthe ELAIS-N1 field was planned to be part of the\nFLS program, the FLS observations of the ELAISN1 field have now been revised to a very deep\n10'\u00d710' pointing to evaluate the confusion limits of the MIPS instrument. The remainder of\nthe ELAIS-N1 field will now be imaged as part\nof a larger survey in this region, a portion of the\nSWIRE Spitzer Legacy Survey (Lonsdale et al.,\n2003).\nIn section 2 we review the overall observing\nstrategy and describe the MOSAIC-1 observations. In section 3 we discuss the techniques used\nin the data reduction including the astrometric\nand photometric calibration of the images. We\ndescribe in section 4 the data products made publicly available. We detail in section 5 the criteria\nused to detect, classify, and photometrically measure objects in the images. Section 5 also includes\na description of the information available in our\ncatalogs. In section 6 we examine the quality of\nthe imaging data by comparing them with other\navailable data sets. Finally, a brief summary is\ngiven in section 7.\n\ncentric orbit. Spitzer can also make observations\nsimultaneously in multiple bands (with IRAC\u20133.6\nand 4.5 or 5.8 and 8 \u03bcm; with MIPS\u201324, 70 and\n160 \u03bcm).\nMany extragalactic surveys are already scheduled with Spitzer as Legacy programs (SWIRE,\nLonsdale et al. 2003; GOODS, Dickinson & Giavalisco 2001) or as observations by the Instrument Teams (Wide, Deep and Ultra-Deep Spitzer\nsurveys which will cover regions like the Bo\u00f6tes\nfield of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey, the\nGroth strip, Lockman Hole, XMM-Deep and so\non, see e.g. Dole et al. 2001). The First Look Survey utilizes 112 hours of Director's Discretionary\ntime on Spitzer and includes extragalactic, galactic, and ecliptic components1 . These data will be\navailable to all observers when the Spitzer Science\nArchive opens in May, 2004. The purpose of the\nFLS is to characterize the mid-infrared sky at previously unexplored depths and make these data\nrapidly available to the astronomical community.\nThe extragalactic component is comprised of a 4\nsquare degree survey with IRAC and MIPS near\nthe north ecliptic pole centered at J1718+5930.\nThese observations were executed on 2003 December 1-11.\nTo fully exploit the Spitzer FLS data we have\nobtained ancillary surveys at optical (this paper)\nand radio wavelengths (Condon et al. 2003).\nGiven the modest spatial resolution of the Spitzer\nimagers (the point spread function is large, especially in the mid and far-IR, e.g. 5.7 arcseconds\nfull width at half maximum, FWHM, for the 24\n\u03bcm channel), the first problem to solve for the\ninfrared sources detected by Spitzer will be to associate these sources with an optical counterpart,\nwhen possible. This will then allow the higher\nspatial resolution of the available optical images\nto assist with the source classification (e.g. as\nstars, galaxies or QSO) and enable targeting of\nsubsets of the sources for spectroscopy with optical or near-IR spectrographs. Since many of the\ninfrared sources that will be detected by Spitzer\nwill be dust-obscured galaxies with faint optical\ncounterparts, the complementary optical imaging\nmust be relatively deep.\nAlthough a deep multi-wavelength optical survey would be more useful, allowing one to com1 see\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe optical observations of the FLS region\n(centered at 17h 18m 00s +59o30\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 , J2000) and\n\nthe FLS website at ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/fls\n\n2\n\n\fFor organizational purposes we chose to divide\nthe proposed FLS survey region into 30 subfields\neach roughly the size of an individual MOSAIC-1\npointing. The coordinates of these subfields are\nlisted in Table 2. During our observing run we\nwere able to complete observations for 26 of these\nsubfields. We similarly divided the ELAIS-N1 field\ninto 12 subfields, but only completed observations\nfor 5 of these fields. Each subfield was observed for\na minimum of three 10 min exposures. In practice,\nsome images were not suitable (poor seeing, flat\nfielding problem, or some other defect) and were\nnot included in the final coadded or \"stacked\" images we are providing to the community. Table 2\nlists in Col. 4 the number of exposures which were\nobtained and included in the coadded or \"stacked\"\nimages. In order to provide some coverage in the\nregions of the sky that would fall in the inter-chip\ngaps, the positions of successive exposures of a\ngiven field were offset on order of an arcminute\nrelative to each other. In general the first exposure was at the nominal (tabulated) position, the\nsecond shifted by 41.5\u2032 in \u03b1 and \u221262.3\u2032 in \u03b4, and\nthe third with a shift of \u221241.5\u2032 and 62.3\u2032 in \u03b1\nand \u03b4. In a few cases an additional position with\n\u2206\u03b1 = 20.8\u2032 and \u2206\u03b2 = 31.1\u2032 has been observed.\nFor a few fields, observations have been repeated\ndue to the bad seeing or pointing errors.\nThe KPNO imaging observations were made on\n2000 May 4-7,9 UT. A log of the observations is\nsummarized in Table 3, which lists for each group\nof observations: the date of the observations (Col.\n1); the subfield name (Col.2); the integration time\nand the number of exposures (Col. 3); and the seeing (delivered image quality expressed as FWHM\nin arcseconds of bright unsaturated stars) range of\neach exposure (Col. 4).\nDuring a portion of the observing run, the\npointing of the telescope was incorrectly initialized, resulting in approximately a 24\u2032 error in\nthe pointing for some fields. These are noted in\nthe observing log. Since the 24\u2032 offset did not\nmap exactly on to our subfield grid, we chose to\nmake stacked or combined images for several of\nthe subfields. This was done for subfields # 11\nand # 17 in the FLS region and subfields (# 6,\n# 9 and # 10) of ELAIS-N1. In Figures 2 and 3\nwe show the positions of each subfield on the sky\nwith respect to the fields which have been covered\nwith the IRAC and MIPS instruments on-board\n\nFig. 1.- Transmission curve of the R-band filter (solid line) used for the observations. The\ndashed line indicates the combined response when\nconsidering also the CCD quantum efficiency, the\nthroughput of the prime focus corrector, and the\natmospheric absorption with a typical airmass of\n1.2.\nof the ELAIS-N1 region (centered at 16h 10m 01s\n+54o 30\u2032 36\u2032\u2032 , J2000, see Oliver et al. 2000) were\ncarried out using the MOSAIC-1 camera on the\nMayall 4m Telescope at the Kitt Peak National\nObservatory. The MOSAIC-1 camera is comprised\nof eight thinned, back-illuminated SITe 2048 \u00d7\n4098 CCDs with a projected pixel size of 0.258\narcsec (Muller et al. 1998). The 8 CCDs are physically separated by gaps with widths of approximately 14 and 15.5 arcsec along the right ascension and declination directions, respectively. The\nfull field of view of the camera is therefore 36 \u00d7 36\nsquare arcmin, with a filling factor of 97%. Observations were performed using the Harris Set\nKron-Cousins R-band filter whose main features\nare summarized in Table 1. The transmission\ncurve of the filter is shown in Figure 1 together\nwith the resulting modifications that would be introduced by the corrector and camera optics, the\nCCD quantum efficiency, and atmospheric extinction.\n\n3\n\n\fpackage (v4.7), which is part of IRAF.3\nThe image quality of the final stacks is variable,\nas was the seeing during the run. Users of the images should be aware that the detailed shape of\nthe point spread function in a given image stack\ncould be variable across the field, not only because\nof residual distortions in the camera, but because\na given position in the field might be the average of different input images, each with their own\npoint spread function. No attempt was made to\nmatch the PSFs of the individual images before\ncombining the images.\nIn a survey area this large there will be fields\nwith very bright stars. This can cause some regions of the survey area to be impacted by scattered light from these stars. Some effort was made\n3 IRAF\n\nis distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation\n\nFig. 2.- The KPNO fields in the FLS region cover\nmost of the MIPS (grey) and IRAC (dark grey)\nSpitzer observations.\nSpitzer.

(in preparation). The bulk of the software\nused to process the images and generate combined\nimages for each subfield from the individual 10\nminute exposures is described by Valdes (2002)\nand contained as part of the MSCRED software\n\nFig. 3.- The KPNO fields in the ELAIS-N1 region.

The grey shaded square is the field observed with Spitzer to test the MIPS 24 micron\nconfusion limit. The SWIRE planned field (Lonsdale et al. 2003) is marked with a dash-dotted\nline.\n\n2 www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/ReductionOpt/frames.html\n\n4\n\n\fcalibration has been performed using the reduction protocol developed for the reduction of the\nNOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS) data\nwhich assumes as astrometric reference the USNOA2.0 catalog (Monet et al. 1998). Adopting the\nGSC II catalog,4 which became available after the\ndevelopment of the NDWFS reduction protocol,\nmight improve the quality of the astrometric solutions and this might be done if a rereduction of\nthe data set is done in the future. As we discuss\nfurther below, the anticipated improvement would\nbe slight. For the images described in this paper\nour solutions for the mapping of the MOSAIC-1\npixels into a world coordinate frame had an RMS\nscatter of between 0.3 to 0.45 arcseconds, depending on the particular field.\nAfter each image was provided with an improved astrometric calibration, it was tangentplane projected with respect to the FLS and\nELAIS-N1 field center positions listed above. Following projection, the individual exposures (typically three for a given region of the sky) could be\ncombined into a final, stacked, image. These are\nthe images currently being made available in the\nSpitzer and NOAO archives.\nDuring the final stages of the data reduction,\nwhen the individual images were being combined\nto make the final image stacks, it was determined\nthat there was an error in the high-order astrometric correction file for the Harris R-band filter\naffecting the adjacent edges of CCDs 7 and 8 in the\nMOSAIC-1 camera. The original solutions for the\nhigh order distortion terms were determined on a\nchip by chip basis with no requirement that the\nsolution be continuous across the entire field. In\ngeneral, while this requirement was not imposed,\nit was met by the solutions provided by NOAO.\nHowever, for the R-band the solution available at\nthe time we were reducing the data was discon-\n\nto minimize this impact during the observations\n(by shifting pointings) and reduction of the images (through masking of affected regions in some\nimages to allow unaffected images to be the sole\ncontribution to the stacked image), but users of\nthe images should be aware that some scattered\nlight will have made it into some of the stacks.\nAn example of a subfield with significant scattered\nlight is FLS 15.\nFlat fielding of the images was accomplished\nthrough the application of calibration files generated first from observations of a flat-field screen\ninside the dome at the 4m and from a \"super-sky\"\nflat constructed by combining the majority of the\nFLS and ELAIS-N1 images (with objects masked\nand rejected). The result is generally excellent flat\nfielding of the sky (with some fields with slightly\ndifferent sky color, due to moon light or twilight\nworse), but users should be aware that there are\nlikely to be some color-dependent variations between and within the 8 CCDs, meaning that uncorrected errors in the photometry of a given object, attributable to the flat fielding correction not\nbeing derived from a source with color matched to\nthe color of that object, on the order of 1 to 3 percent could still be present in the data even though\nthe sky is generally quite \"flat\".\n3.2.\n\nAstrometric Calibration\n\nThe astrometric calibration of the MOSAIC-1\nimages is accomplished in two steps. First, the\nhigh-order distortions in the field, which will in\ngeneral be common to all our exposures (those anticipated to be the result of the optics and/or CCD\nplacement and as a result stable over the course\nof an observing run or season) are calibrated using observations of an astrometric standard field.\nThese distortions can be wavelength dependent,\nso the calibration is made for the specific filter\nbeing used. These images are analyzed to produce a default correction for each of the CCDs.\nLow-order corrections (translational offset, small\nrotation, and/or scale adjustments needed to compensate for pointing errors, instrument mounting\nvariations between runs, and atmospheric effects)\nare corrected on an exposure by exposure basis using the many catalog objects in each exposure, the\npreviously mentioned knowledge of the high-order\ndistortions as a function of CCD position, and\nthe software msccmatch in IRAF. The astrometric\n\n4 The\n\nGuide Star Catalogue-II is a joint project of the Space\nTelescope Science Institute and the Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino.

Since each\nsubfield overlaps its neighbor by approximately\ntwo arcminutes, we can estimate the extinction\ndifference between them using a set of common\nsources. This can be expressed in terms of zeropoint that, by definition, includes the effects of\nairmass and extinction. Because each frame has\nmultiple overlaps, the number of frame-to-frame\nmagnitude differences is over-determined with respect to the number of frames. Therefore, one can\nderive the relative zero-point for each frame simultaneously using a least squares estimator. We\nextracted the sources from each subfield using as a\nfirst guess for the zero-point that we computed for\na central subfield (#18 and #5 for the FLS and\nELAIS-N1 fields, respectively). For each overlap\nbetween contiguous fields, we selected the pairs of\nstars with magnitude 18 < R < 21 and computed\nthe median of the difference in magnitudes by using a 3\u03c3 clipping procedure. The magnitudes considered were the auto magnitudes (MAG AUTO)\nfrom SExtractor, which are fairly robust with respect to seeing variations. To estimate the relative zero-points in the sense of the least squares,\nwe minimized the sum:\nX\nNij2 (zi \u2212 zj \u2212 \u2206ij )2 ,\n(1)\n\ntinuous at the CCD7 and CCD8 boundary. Since\nour image stacks are made from the combination\nof three or more images that are offset by 30 arcseconds to an arcminute from each other, this difference between the solutions for the two CCDs\ncan result in a mis-mapping, into RA and DEC\nspace, of a region of the sky imaged first on CCD7\nand then on CCD8. The error is small, and introduces at most an additional 0.1\u2032\u2032 uncertainty to the\npositions of sources in the affected region (which\nis located in the SE Corner of each field, about\n25% of the field up from the southern edge), but\nwill result in a degradation of the PSF for objects\naffected in this region. The size of the affected\nregion in each subfield is approximately 8.5\u2032 EastWest and 2.5\u2032 North-South, or a bit less than 2%\nof the surveyed area.\n3.3.\n\nPhotometric calibration\n\nSince not all the subfields were observed during nights with photometric conditions (see Table 3), we derived a coherent photometric system in two steps. First, we computed the relative photometric zero-points between the differ-\n\ni>j\n\nwhere zi is the variation with respect to the initial guess of the zero-point of the subfield i, and\n\u2206ij is the median of the differences of magnitude\nfor the set of the Nij source pairs in the overlapping region between the subfields i and j. Solving\nthe linear system obtained by imposing that the\nderivatives of (1) with respect each zi are equal to\nzero, we corrected the initial guesses for the zeropoints. The procedure was then iterated until the\nnumber of pairs Nij became stable.\nThe second step was to make use of those fields\nobserved under photometric conditions in order to\nconverge on the best zero-point. Standards were\nmeasured several times over a broad range of airmasses on the first two nights of the observations,\nwhich had the best photometric conditions (see\nTable 3). Only the second night (May 5) was really\nphotometric since all the measurements are coherent (see Figure 4). Magnitudes were calibrated to\nthe Kron-Cousins system using Landolt standards\ntaken from Landolt (1992). They have been obtained using an aperture of 6 arcsec in diameter,\n\nFig. 4.- Dependence of zero-point on the airmass. Each squares is a standard star used in the\ncalibration with 9 standard fields observed during\nthe night of 2000 May 5.\n6\n\n\f5.\n\nlarge enough to obtain accurate measurements according to the growth curves of all the measured\nstars. We have fitted the linear relationship:\nm = m0 \u2212 2.5 log(C/texp ) + mX \u2217 A,\n\nThe main goal of this survey is to catalog galaxies and faint stars and make a first distinction between stars and galaxies on the basis of their intensity profiles. Several bright objects (mainly stars)\nare saturated and excluded from the catalog, but\ncan be found in catalogs from shallower surveys\n(like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the case of\nthe FLS region, see e.g. Stoughton et al. 2002\nand Hogg et al. 2004). The source extraction was\nperformed with the SExtractor package (Bertin &\nArnouts 1996; ver. 2.3) which is well suited for\nsurveys with low to moderate source density as is\nthe case of our surveys.\n\n(2)\n\nwith m magnitude of Landolt standard, A airmass\nduring the observation, C counts during the exposure time texp , m0 and mX the zero and extinction terms, respectively. We used an iterative\n3\u03c3 clipping in order to discard deviant measurements, finding the best fit for m0 = 25.42 and\nmX = \u22120.09. The standard deviation of the residuals for the best fit is 0.03.\n4.\n\nData Products\n\n5.1.\n\nThe analysis of the survey data produced a set\nof intermediate and final products, images and catalogs, which are publicly available at the Spitzer\nScience Center and NOAO Science Archives5 . In\nparticular, we provide the astronomical community with:\nCoadded (Stacked) Images of the Subfields: sky-subtracted, fully processed coadded\nframes for each subfield. The subfields are mapped\nusing a tangential projection. The size of each\nfits compressed image is 220 MB. For each image,\na bad pixel mask and an exposure map is given\n(in the pixel-list IRAF format). The photometric zero-point of each subfield after the absolute\nphotometric calibration of the frame appears in\nthe header of the image. A full description of the\nheader keywords is available at the http sites.\nLow-resolution field image: sky-subtracted,\nfully processed coadded images of the whole field.\nThe images have been created to give a general\noverview of the FLS and ELAIS-N1 fields and have\nbeen produced using a 1.3 arcsec pixel size (corresponding to five times the original size of the\npixel). Users are discouraged from using them to\nextract sources and compute photometry. These\nimages have a size of approximatively 380 Mb and\n80 Mb.\nSingle subfield catalogs: object catalogs associated with each single subfield. A full description of the parameters available is described in the\nfollowing Section. The catalogs are in ASCII format.\n5 ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/fls/extragal/noaor.html\n\nCatalogs\n\nDetection\n\nSeveral parameters have to be fixed to achieve\nan efficient source extraction with SExtractor.\nThe first problem is the evaluation of the background. SExtractor proceeds computing a minibackground on a scale large enough to contain several faint objects and filtering it with a box-car to\navoid the contamination by isolated, extended objects. Finally, a full-resolution background map\nis obtained by interpolation and it is subtracted\nfrom the science image. In our case, many bright\nstars populate the FLS field since it has a moderate galactic latitude (34.9 degrees) while the problem is less important in the case of the ELAIS-N1\nfield (gal. latitude: 44.9 degrees). To evaluate\na background which is not locally dominated by\nbright stars we adopted meshes of 128\u00d7128 pixels for the mini-background corresponding to 33.0\narcsec and used a 9\u00d79 box-car for the medianfiltering.\nIn order to improve the detection of faint\nsources, the image is filtered to enhance the spatial frequency typical of the sources with respect\nto those of the background noise. A Gaussian\nfilter with an FWHM similar to the seeing of the\nimage (in our case 4 pixels, since the overall seeing\nis 1.1) has been used. Although the choice of a\nconvolution kernel with a constant FWHM may\nnot always be optimal since the seeing is varying\nin the different images, the impact on detectability\nis fairly small (Irwin 1985). Moreover, it has the\nadvantage of requiring no changes of the relative\ndetection threshold.\nFinally, the detection is made on the background-\n\nand\n\nwww.noao.edu\n\n7\n\n\fextinction (Schlegel et al. 1998) are small: 0.06\nand 0.01 on average for the FLS and ELAIS-N1\nfields, respectively.\nThe total magnitude of sources close to bright\nobjects are usually inaccurate since the local background is affected by the halo of the bright objects\nand the Kron radius is not correctly computed. To\nimprove the photometry for these sources we have\nsubtracted bright saturated stars from the images\nand excluded from the catalogs the sources detected in square boxes around these stars where\nthe subtraction is not correct. Moreover, we have\nconsidered bright extended galaxies and excluded\nfrom the catalogs all the sources inside the Kron ellipses of the galaxies. In fact, most of these sources\nare bright regions of the galaxies or their photometry is highly affected by the diffuse luminosity of\nthe galaxies.\nTo subtract bright saturated stars from the images we have computed radial density profiles on\nconcentric annuli around the stars. Then, after\nsubtracting these profiles, we have removed the\ndiffraction spikes by fitting their profiles along the\nradius at different angles with Chebyshev polynomials. As visible in Figures 5 and 6, the background is much more uniform and the spikes become shorter. This improves the photometry for\nthe objects surrounding the stars and avoid the\ndetection of faint false sources on the diffraction\nspikes.\nThe correction works well for most of the stars,\nalthough we exclude from the catalogs the immediate neighborhood. In the case of very bright stars\n( Fig 6), multiple reflections between the CCD and\nthe optics make difficult the subraction of a median radial profile and a faint halo is still visible\nafter the correction.\n\nsubtracted and filtered image looking for groups\nof connected pixel above the detection threshold.\nThresholding is in fact the most efficient way to\ndetect low surface brightness objects. In our case,\nwe fixed the minimum number of connected pixels to 15 and the detection threshold to 0.8 (in\nunits of the standard deviation of the background\nnoise), which corresponds to a typical limiting surface brightness \u03bcR \u223c 26 mag arcsec\u22122 . For the\ndetection we made use also of the exposure map as\na weight considered to set the noise level for each\npixel. Some pixels have a null weight since they\ncorrespond to saturated objects, trails of bright\nobjects and other artifacts. These pixels are also\nmarked in the bad pixel mask and the false detections around these image artifacts are flagged and\neasily excluded from our final catalogs.\nOnly objects detected with a signal-to-noise\ngreater than 3 (based on the total magnitude errors) are accepted in our final catalog.\nAlthough not well suited to detect objects in\ncrowded fields, SExtractor allows one also to deblend close objects using a multiple isophotal analysis technique. Two parameters affect the deblending: the number of thresholds used to split\na set of connected pixels according to their luminosity peaks and the minimal contrast (light in\na peak divided by the total light in the object)\nused to decide if deblending a sub-object from the\nrest of the object. In our analysis we used a high\nnumber of thresholds (64) and a very low minimal\ncontrast (1.5 e\u22125 ). Nevertheless, a few blended\nobjects still remain in the catalogs. Visual inspection or other extraction algorithms more efficient\nin crowded fields (e.g, DAOPHOT) are needed to\ntreat these particular cases.\n5.2.\n\nPhotometry\n\n5.3.\n\nThe photometry has been performed on the\nstacked images. Several measurements were made:\naperture and isophotal magnitudes and an estimate of the total magnitudes. We measured the\naperture magnitude within a diameter of 3 arcsec,\nroughly corresponding to three times the overall\nseeing. Total magnitudes (MAG AUTO) are estimated using an elliptical aperture with an approach similar to that proposed by Kron (1980).\nSince these fields have been selected in sky regions\nwith low Galactic extinction to observe extragalactic infrared sources, the corrections for Galactic\n\nStar/galaxy separation\n\nSExtractor uses a neural network to separate\nstar-like from extended sources returning a stellarity index (CLASS STAR) with values between\n1 (a perfect star-like object) and 0. The distribution of this index as a function of the magnitude\nin one of our fields (FLS18) is shown in Figure 7.\nThe standard neural network of SExtractor has\nbeen trained for seeing FWHM values between\n0.02 and 5.5 arcsec and for images that have 1.5 <\nFWHM < 5 pixels. It is therefore perfectly suited\n\n8\n\n\fFig. 5.- A 1.5'\u00d71.5' field around a bright saturated star in the field FLS 6 before and after the star removal.\nThe overplotted square delimits the region which is not considered in the final catalog.\n\nFig. 6.- A 7'\u00d77' field around a bright saturated star in the field FLS 13 before and after the star removal.\nThe overplotted square delimits the region which is not considered in the final catalog.

In order\nto select stars in an efficient way, we followed the\ntechnique of Groenewegen et al. (2002) choosing\na threshold which is a function of the magnitude.\nWe consider that our objects are stars if:\nCLASS ST AR > 0.85\n\n... for R < 23 (3)\n\nCLASS ST AR > 0.90\n\n... elsewhere. (4)\n\nAll the catalogs in the archive are in ASCII format. Each catalog has been verified with several\ntests to check the reliability of the measured quantities with other sets of data. The results of some\nof these tests are described in the next section.\n6.\n\nThe characteristics of the data obtained by the\npresent survey are summarized in Table 5 which\nlists: in Col. 1 the name of the subfield, in Cols.\n2-3 the center of the subfield, in Col. 4 the seeing\nof the combined image, in Cols. 5-6 the 3\u03c3 and\n5\u03c3 limiting R Cousin magnitudes, in Cols. 7-8 the\nnumber of galaxies and stars with S/N \u2265 3\u03c3 which\nare not saturated.\nWe measured the limiting R Cousin magnitude\ninside the aperture with the highest signal-to-noise\nratio in case of a Gaussian PSF dominated by the\n\nA drawback of this technique is that at faint\nmagnitudes QSOs are also classified as stars. However, using multi-band catalogs one can address\nthe issue of separating stars and QSOs on the basis of their spectral energy distributions.\n5.4.\n\nSurvey performance\n\nSource lists\n\nAs an illustration, the tabulation of the first 30\nentries in the FLS 2 source catalog is presented\n10\n\n\ffalse-positive detections occur only at faint magnitudes (R>23.8). Considering all the 3\u03c3 objects, in\nthe magnitude interval 23.5<R<24.5 there are 150\nfalse-positive detection per sq. degree corresponding to 0.5% of the total number of sources. In the\nmagnitude interval 24.5<R<25.5, there are 119\nfalse-positive detections per sq. degree which correspond to 17% of the total of number of sources\ndetected in this magnitude range.\n6.1.\n\nAstrometry\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the astrometric calibration, we compared the positions of the stars\ninside the FLS field with those available from the\nSloan survey (Stoughton et al. 2002, Data Release\n1) and with radio sources from the VLA survey in\nthe FLS field (Condon et al. 2003).\nIn the comparison with the Sloan sources, we\nconsidered only good objects (according to the\nflags) classified as stars in the Sloan catalog with\nR magnitude between 18 and 21. Table 6 reports\nthe number of stars used in the comparison and\nthe offsets between our and Sloan positions. Typ-\n\nFig. 8.- Projected distribution of galaxies extracted from the FLS 6 image. Square masks\naround the bright saturated stars and elliptical\nmasks around bright extended galaxies in the field\nare shown.\nsky. Considering a Gaussian profile, the S/N ratio\ninside an aperture R can be written as:\nS/N =\n\nRR\n0\n\nCe\u22122 ln 2r/W dr\nq\n,\nR2 2\n\u03c0\u2206\n2 \u03c3S\n\n(5)\n\nwith W , FWHM, C, central intensity of the\nsource, \u2206, pixel size, and \u03c3S , the sky noise. The\nR for which S/N is maximal corresponds to the\nR for which \u2202(S/N )/\u2202R = 0. This condition\nis realized at R \u2248 1.35W/2, i.e. an aperture of\n1.35 \u00d7 FHWM.\nSince we are considering in our catalogs an\naperture of 3 arcsec and our typical FHWM is 1.0\narcsec, these values are slightly deeper than what\none can find in our catalogs.\nThe fraction of spurious objects was estimated\nby creating catalogs from the survey images multiplied by -1. Since ideally the noise is symmetric, we can use these images to produce a catalog\nof spurious sources by applying the same criteria of extraction which have been used with the\nreal images. Analyzing the central square degree,\n\nFig. 9.- Comparison between the positions of\nstars in common with the Sloan survey for the\nfield FLS-18. Offsets are computed as our minus\nSloan positions.\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 10.- Comparison between the R magnitudes\nof stars in common with the Sloan Survey in the\nfield FLS-18 as a function of the R magnitude\n(Vega system).\n\nFig. 11.- Offsets between our and Sloan magnitudes for stars with 18 < R < 21 in the various\nFLS fields. The average difference is \u22120.007 \u00b1\n0.016.\n\nical offsets are 0.1 arcsec in right ascension and\ndeclination with an rms of 0.1 arcsec. The offsets\nbetween our catalog and the Sloan stars in the case\nof the field FLS-18 are shown in Figure 9. The\ncomparison with the VLA sources has been made\nconsidering all the optical counterparts down to\nR=24 of non-extended radio sources. The offsets\nfrom the VLA positions are also of order 0.1 arcsec.\nThe systematic offset between ours and Sloan\npositions comes from the fact that our astrometry is based on the USNO-A2 catalog, while Sloan\ntakes Tycho2 stars as reference. Comparing the\nSloan and USNO-A2 positions in the whole FLS\nfield, we have an offset of \u2206\u03b1 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.28 and\n\u2206\u03b4 = 0.15\u00b10.34 arcsec which is in complete agreement with the offsets found in Table 6.\nFinally, we compared our R-band catalog to the\nGSC II finding an offset of \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.18\nand \u2206\u03b4 = 0.22 \u00b1 0.15 arcsec. While not large, this\noffset should be noted when making comparison\nto data sets that used the GSC II for reference.\nNevertheless, the remarkably small rms in both\ndirections obtained comparing our and Sloan po-\n\nsitions suggests an intrinsic accuracy of . 0.1 arcsec for each catalog which is well within the requirements for slit/fiber positioning, an essential\nrequirement for public surveys.\n6.2.\n\nPhotometry\n\nThe Sloan survey also allows us to compare the\nphotometric calibration. Although the magnitude\nsystem used in this survey is different from ours,\nwe can obtain a relationship between the R Cousin\nmagnitude and the Sloan magnitudes using the 92\nLandolt stars which have been observed by the\nSloan group to calibrate their observations (Smith\net al. 2002). Before making the comparison, we\nhave converted the r' and i' magnitudes to the\nSDSS 2.5m natural system, using the equations:\nrSDSS\niSDSS\n\n=\n=\n\nr\u2032 + 0.035 (r\u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 \u2212 0.21),\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ni + 0.041 (r \u2212 i \u2212 0.21),\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nas explained at the Sloan web site6 . Then, we have\nobtained a relationship between R and the Sloan\n6 www.sdss.org/DR1/algorithms/jeg\n\n12\n\nphotometric eq dr1.html\n\n\fcolors with a least square fit:\nR = \u22120.16 + rSDSS \u2212 0.26 (rSDSS \u2212 iSDSS ). (8)\nUsing a biweight estimator, the difference between\nthe real R and the value estimated with the relationship (8) is on average of 0.0001 (with an rms of\n0.007). In spite of the large scatter, the relationship is useful from a statistical point of view since\nwe are interested only in confirming our magnitude\nzero-point.\nWe have therefore compared the magnitudes of\nthe stars in the FLS fields with the values deduced from the Sloan survey with the equation\n(8). Table 6 summarizes the median differences\nin magnitude between our measurements (automagnitudes) and the model complete magnitude\nas computed by Sloan for stars with magnitude\n18 < R < 21 in the different FLS fields. In Figure 10 we show the distribution of the magnitude\noffsets in the case of the central field FLS-18, while\nin Figure 11 we illustrate the offsets for the various fields. Our calibration agrees on average with\nthe Sloan one, since the average difference between\nour and Sloan measurements is \u22120.007 \u00b1 0.016.\nThe biggest differences are found in the external\nsubfields where the relative zero is not well constrained due to the low number of stars in common\nbetween adjacent subfields (see Figure 11).\n6.3.\n\nFig. 12.- Star counts in the central square degree of the FLS region from our R images (solid\nline) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalogs (dotted line). For comparison, the dashed line refers\nto the counts in the Chandra South region (Groenewegen et al., 2002).\nstar counts in the ELAIS field and those in the\nChandra field (Groenewegen et al., 2002). These\nfields, which lie at higher galactic latitudes are, as\nexpected, less populated by stars.\nTo evaluate the variation in the number counts\ndue to the varying observing conditions, we have\ncomputed the counts for each of the subfield in the\nFLS field. In Figure 13 we show these counts as\nwell as the median counts with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation as measured\nfrom the observed scatter in the counts of the different subfields. One can easily see that a few subfields (#4, #7, #8, #15 and #26) are less deep\nthan the other ones, as expected from the quantities measured in Table 5. Fortunately, these fields\nare external and have been only partially covered\nby Spitzer observations. The other 20 fields in the\nFLS are quite homogeneous.\nMedian counts are then reported in Figure 14 to\ncompare them with the results from other surveys.\nThe dotted line corresponds the counts from SDSS\nin the FLS field (Stoughton et al. 2002) com-\n\nNumber counts\n\nCounting galaxies and stars as a function of the\nmagnitude allows one to evaluate the overall characteristics of a catalog as depth and homogeneity.\nIn Figures 12 and 14 we show star and galaxy\ncounts in the FLS region and compare them with\nanalogous counts using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Stoughton et al. 2002).\nTo compare the two distributions, we have\ntransformed the SDSS magnitudes into the R Vega\nmagnitudes using the relationship 8.\nIn the case of star counts (Fig. 12), the counts\nfrom our survey and the SDSS agree very well between R=18 and R=22. For magnitudes brighter\nthan R=18, most of the stars detected in our survey are saturated and do not appear in our catalogs. Star counts drop very rapidly for magnitudes\nfainter than R=24 since the profile criterion used\nfor the star/galaxy separation fails for faint objects. For comparison, we show in Figure 12 the\n13\n\n\fFig. 13.- Galaxy counts in the various FLS subfields. The numbers refer to the FLS subfields with\nshallowest depths.\n\nFig. 14.- Galaxy counts in the FLS region from\nour R images (solid line) and Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey catalogs (dotted line). Results from counts\nin other sky regions are overplotted.\n\nputed transforming the SDSS magnitudes into the\nR Vega magnitudes using the relationship in equation (8). The points from the general SDSS counts\n(Yasuda et al., 2001) have been approximatively\ntransformed using the relationship by Fukugita et\nal. (1995) assuming that galaxies have R \u2212 r\u2032 colors typical of spirals at redshift of 0.2 \u2013 0.5. At the\nfaint end of the counts, results from several deep\nsurveys are reported.\nAs an estimate of the completeness of our images we have compared our counts to the SDSS\ncounts in the FLS field for R<21 and to median\ncounts from the other deep surveys at magnitudes\nfainter than R = 21. In Figure 15 we show the\ncompleteness of the single subfields in the FLS\nfield (thin lines) and those of the global field and\nthe SDSS survey (continuous and dashed thick\nlines, respectively). Our survey is deeper than the\nSDSS data by almost three magnitudes. It is 50%\ncomplete around R=24.5. This estimate is conservative, since the number of spurious detection at\nR=24.5 is still relatively small (less than 0.5%).\nFinally, for magnitudes brighter than R=18,\nthe galaxy catalogs are slightly incomplete since\na few extended objects are saturated.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nA deep NOAO/KPNO survey in the R band has\nbeen carried out to observe a field of more than\n9 square degrees centered at 17:18:00 +59:30:00\n(J2000) aimed to find optical counterparts for the\nFirst Look Survey which surveys 7 different infrared wavelengths with the instruments IRAC\nand MIPS using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Another 2.3 square degrees have been surveyed in\nthe ELAIS-N1 region which will be observed in\nthe Spitzer SWIRE Legacy survey. This paper describes the observation strategy, the data reduction and the products which are publicly available\nto the astronomical community on the World Wide\nWeb at the Spitzer Science Center and the NOAO\nScience Archives.\nThe overall quality of the data is good and homogeneous: the average seeing is 1.1 and typically\nvaries between 0.9 and 1.2. The limiting magnitude of the images, measured inside an aperture of\n1.35 \u00d7 FWHM for which the S/N ratio is maximal,\nis around R=25.5 at 5\u03c3, deep enough to detect optical counterparts for a substantial fraction of the\n\n14\n\n\fdirectors discretionary time used to gather the optical data we present in this paper, M.
