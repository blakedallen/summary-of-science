Introduction\nThe ubiquitous mid-IR emission bands, widely observed\nin the spectra of dusty astrophysical sources (from protoplanetary disks to starburst galaxies), are attributed to\nthe emission of a family of carbonaceous macromolecules:\nthe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However,\nbecause these bands are due to nearest neighbor vibrations of the C-C or C-H bonds, they are not specific to\nindividual PAH species. Therefore, in spite of their major\nrelevance for astrophysics (as tracers of the presence of\nUV radiation fields or star forming regions in a broader\nextragalactic context), the identification of a given PAH\nmolecule in space has yet not been possible. This contribution explores the new possibilities that could be offered\nby SPICA spectrometers to better characterize PAHs: In\nthe mid-IR, high angular resolution will enable to better\nestablish the link between the chemical evolution of PAHs\nand VSGs in connection with the evolution of physical\n\nconditions and the formation/excitation of H2 . This will\nthen allow to use them as tracers of physical conditions\nat low and high redshifts. In the far-IR, we expect to possibly detect the low-energy vibrational modes of PAHs\nwhich are much more connected to the structure of each\nmolecule and can thus provide an unprecedented characterization of their nature and evolution in space.\n2. Mid-infrared observations of PAH bands\n2.1. PAHs/VSGs: tracers of physical conditions\nThe mid-IR emission of PAHs and VSGs has been well\ncharacterized by ISO (see e.g. Peeters et al. 2002; Rapacioli et al.\n2005) and more recently by Spitzer (see e.g. Werner et al.\n2004; Bern\u00e9 et al. 2007). The observed spectrum usually\nconsists in a set of bands that are most prominent at\n3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 \u03bcm. It was established\nthat the modification of the shape of this spectrum can\nbe attributed to alteration of the chemical structure of\nthe emitting component (Peeters et al. 2002; Hony et al.\n2001) and that this chemical evolution is strongly connected to the local physical conditions. In particular, models (Tielens 2005) and observations (Joblin et al. 1996;\nGalliano et al. 2008) have shown that the variations of\nthe 6.2 (or 8.6) to 11.3 \u03bcm band intensity ratio (I6.2\n\u221a/I11.3 )\nevolves with the \"ionization parameter\" \u03b3 = G0 \u00d7 T /nH\nwhere G0 is the intensity of the UV radiation field in\nHabing's units, T is the gas temperature and nH the total\nhydrogen nuclei density. Following this work Bern\u00e9 et al.\n(2009b) have shown that the combination of the measurement of I6.2 /I11.3 and of the ratio between the H2\n0-0 S(3) and S(2) line intensities, respectively at 9.7 and\n12.3 \u03bcm, allows to derive the individual values of T , G0\nand nH when they fall in the ranges T = 250 \u2212 1500K,\nnH = 104 \u2212 106 cm\u22123 , G0 = 103 \u2212 105 respectively.\n2.2. PAHs/VSGs: role in the formation of H2 (?)\nH2 is the most abundant molecule in the universe but its\nformation mechanism is still an open question. It is however clear that H2 forms at the surface of grains, as the\ngas-phase routes are too inefficient under standard ISM\nconditions (Gould & Salpeter 1963). The formation rate\nof H2 in photodissociation regions (PDRs) was found to\nbe larger than that derived from the classical formation\n\nProc.

Colors combine as in an RGB image\ni.e. green (PAH0 )+red (VSGs)=yellow. In contours are shown the filaments detected in ERE with Hubble.\nmechanism at the surface of cold grains (Habart et al.\n2004). Furthermore, Joblin et al. (2000) have shown that\nPAH/VSG and H2 emissions spatially correlate. In this\ncontext, it has been considered that PAHs and/or VSGs\ncould play a role in the catalysis of H2 formation.\n2.3. PAH and VSG chemistry with SPICA\nThe study of galactic PDRs, where one can resolve the\nvariations of PAH and VSG emissions as the UV field\nis attenuated, is crucial for the understanding of their\nchemical evolution and their link with H2 formation. Until\nnow, PDRs have been extensively observed in the mid-IR\nbut only at low angular resolution. There is nevertheless\nstrong evidence that the zone where \"everything happens\"\nis in fact very thin and not resolved by Spitzer and ISO.\nIndeed, the evolution from VSGs to PAHs occurs in a region of less than 2 magnitudes where physical conditions\nvary significantly. Considering that the molecular cloud\nhas a density of 105 cm\u22123 this extinction represents, at\na distance of 500 pc, an angular scale of \u223c1.3\" requiring subarcsecond resolution to be probed. Observational\nevidences of this sharp variation of density and radiation\nfield are numerous: Bern\u00e9 et al. (2008) have shown that\nthe transition from VSGs to PAHs, traced by the Extended Red Emission, is very sharp (filaments of \u223c1\")\nin NGC 7023 (Fig. 1). The same conclusions are found for\nNGC 2023 (Pilleri et al. in prep.). H2 2.12 \u03bcm high angular resolution data also evidence this very thin transition\n(Lemaire et al. 1999). Radio interferometric (Gerin et al.\n2009), and near-IR H2 (Habart et al. 2005), observations\nhave evidenced the arcsecond scale chemical stratification\nin the Horshead PDR. In the same region, a steep density gradient has been put forward by Pety et al. (2005)\n\nas well as a possible destruction of PAH molecules occurring within these small spatial scales. In Monoceros R2\nand the Orion bar, H2 2.12 \u03bcm observations also suggest\nthe presence of a thin membrane separating the molecular gas from the HII region (Walmsley et al. 2000). Unfortunately, it has for now been impossible to spatially\nresolve this frontier with spectral maps in the mid-IR as\nthe best achieved angular resolution with Spitzer IRS was\n3.6\". This prevents from understanding the link between\nthe chemical evolution of PAHs and VSGs and the origin\nof ERE or H2 formation processes. The MIRACLE camera onboard SPICA will be particularly suited to solve this\nobservational issue. With a subarcsecond resolution, while\nhaving a low spectral resolution adapted to PAH bands,\nMIRACLE will enable, for the first time, to probe these\nchemical frontiers that are crucial for our understanding\nof PAHs/VSGs and H2 photochemistry (Fig. 1). One key\npoint is the use of the imaging with band filters at R\u223c5.\nThe fitting of the limited number of spectral points with a\nlinear combination of PAH0 , PAH+ and VSG spectra (see\ntemplates adapted from Fig. 1 in Bern\u00e9 et al. 2009) will\nprovide, for each position in the images, a good estimation\nof the full mid-IR spectra as well as the spatial distribution\nof PAH and VSG populations, without spending any\ntime doing spectroscopy. This can only be achieved\nif the number of filters in the 5-14 \u03bcm range is sufficient\n(>10). Furthermore, the large field of view (FoV) provided by SPICA in the mid-IR will allow to map much\nlarger regions at once. For instance, the NGC 7023 reflection nebula fits entirely in the MIRACLE FoV (i.e. North,\nEast and South PDRs at the same time).\n\n\f3\n\nSpitzer IRS\n\nSPICA\nMIRACLE\n\nFigure 2.

Right: The SpitzerInfraRed Spectrograph spectrum of Gomez's Hamburger in\nblack and adjusted PAH/VSG model (from Bern\u00e9 et al\n2009) in blue.\n3. PAHs in protoplanetary disks\nIt has become clear, in the recent years, that the disks of\ngas and dust that form around young stellar objects are\nthe cradles of planetary formation (see e.g. recent observations of exoplanet embedded in the disk of Formalhaut by\nKalas et al. 2008). PAHs and VSGs are know to be present\nin the gas-rich protoplanetary disks and play multiple\nroles: (i) they can be considered as building blocks from\nwhich larger bodies can form by aggregation, (ii) because\nthey are a major source of optical thickness in the UV\n(Draine & Li 2007) they shield the gas from photodissociation (Dullemond et al. 2007; Bern\u00e9 et al. 2009) and slow\nthe photo-evaporation process (Alexander 2008). Only\nvery few studies from the ground have enabled to look at\nthe properties of PAHs within protoplanetary disk, and\nonly in imaging through broad-band filters (Lagage et al.\n2006; Geers et al. 2007). MIRACLE will spatially resolve\nsuch disks (see e.g. Fig. 3), and with imaging at R\u223c5 provide the maps of PAHs0/+ and VSGs. Using the methods\ndescribed in Sect.2.1 we will be able to obtain the physical\nproperties of different regions of the surface at the disk.\n4. Redshifted mid-IR PAH bands\nSpitzer has brought clear evidence that PAH bands are\npresent in the emission of galaxies dominated by star formation at z > 2 (see e.g. Pope et al. 2008). Star formation\nrates (SFR) of galaxies can then be estimated by relating\nthe PAH luminosity to the total IR luminosity (see e.g.\nBrandl et al. 2006) and then the total IR luminosity to\nthe SFR using the Kennicutt (1998) law. Recent studies\nhave also intended to relate the ionization fraction / size\nof PAHs to the SFR (O'Dowd et al. 2009). SPICA will enable to better characterize the relationship between SFR\n\nand PAH emission, and will provide PAH spectra of galaxies at higher red-shifts (see cosmological implications in\nthe extragalactic section of these proceedings). One important point is that with it's unprecedented sensitivity,\nSPICA will allow to observe both the PAH and H2\nemissions at high z. As show by Bern\u00e9 et al. (2009b) this\ncan be very useful to learn about the physical conditions\nprevailing in the emitting environment.\n5. Far-IR modes of PAHs\nFar-IR emission bands of PAHs would specific fingerprints\nof individual molecules. These low-energy vibrations involve the bending of the whole PAH skeleton (mostly outof-plane) and are thus intrinsically related to the structure\nof each possible PAH carrier. Unfortunately, PAHs tend\nto release their vibrational energy mostly through mid-IR\nemission, and thus their far-IR bands are expected to be\nvery weak. As an example, 0.2% of the total UV energy\nabsorbed by a PAH like coronene, will be emitted in FIR\nband emission (Joblin et al. 2002). Therefore, the PAH\nFIR band emission is expected to be difficult to detect in\nspace. Nonetheless, it can be shown that if all the midIR emission observed in the ISM was due to only a few\nlarge PAH molecules, their far-IR emission band should\nbe detectable even with a low (<100) signal-to-noise ratio (see Mulas et al. 2006 and Fig. 3). ISO/LWS detected\nseveral unidentified far-IR bands (Cernicharo et al. 2002;\nGoicoechea et al. 2004) although none could specifically\nbe attributed to PAH emission. The non detection of such\nbands with ISO combined with other evidence in the midIR (Peeters et al. 2002), suggest that a scheme in which\nthere are only a few different PAH molecules is unlikely.\nIf instead, there are 50 different PAHs responsible for the\nmid-IR band spectrum, the strongest band emitted by all\nof them in the far-IR will have a peak intensity of \u223c1%\nof the thermal continuum intensity. While this emission\nmay seem extremely weak, it is not impossible to detect\nit, given the progresses made in far-IR space instruments,\nand the prospects of much improved sensitivity with the\nSPICA/SAFARI spectrometer. If there were really 50 different PAHs in space, the problem might come from somewhere else: the relatively uncertain wavelength position of\nthese PAH bands, and from spectral confusion. Indeed,\nthe more numerous interstellar PAHs are, the more numerous far-IR PAH bands there will be. Fortunately, recent progress in the field of interstellar PAHs suggests that\nthere are in fact only a limited number of large and compact PAHs in space (see Tielens 2008 for review), that\ncan resist the harsh interstellar conditions thanks to their\nability to redistribute the energy they absorb efficiently\ninside the molecule, these are the so called Grand-PAHs.\nThe instantaneous broad band coverage of SAFARI-FTS\nwill be specially adapted for deep searches of far-IR bands\nwhere the wavelength positions are not constrained spectroscopically and can appear in the whole domain.

Modeled spectrum of a PDR with a G0 = 105 radiation field, column density of NH = 1020 cm\u22122 and 20%\nof carbon locked in PAHs and assuming that the mid-IR bands are due to C110 H23 and C32 H14 . The adopted spectral\nresolution is \u223c 1000. The mid-IR PAH bands in the spectrum and the continuum emission calculated with the model\nof Draine & Li (2007). The far-IR emission PAH bands are calculated using the photochemical model of Mulas et al.\n(2006) using IR cross sections calculated by Malloci et al. (2007) and I. Cami (private com.).\ndiscovery of the specific PAH carriers responsible of the\nwidespread mid-IR PAH emission (local and extragalactic) will constitute a tremendous step forward for our understanding of the chemical complexity of the universe.\nBefore that, unprecedented efforts in parallel instrumental, theoretical, laboratory and observational aspects will\nhave to be carried out. Herschel will be limited in terms of\nwavelength coverage and sensitivity in the far-IR, and thus\nSPICA/SAFARI can represent our first chance to detect\nspecific PAHs.\nAcknowledgements\nOB is supported by JAE-Doc CSIC fellowship.
