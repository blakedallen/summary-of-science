The ordering temperatures Tc of Ising spin\nglasses (ISGs) are not expected to be universal but to depend on the form of the interaction distribution. In ISGs\nwith random near neighbour interactions of zero mean\nhJij i = 0 the interaction distributions are normalized ac2\ncording to the standard convention hJij\ni = 1 (where h..i\nrepresents an average over the interaction distribution\nJij between pairs of spins). It was suggested on purely\nempirical grounds1 that Tc values should be ranked from\nhighest to lowest according to the value of the kurtosis\nof the interaction distribution,\n4\n2 2\nK = hJij\ni/hJij\ni\n\n(1)\n\nand find that\n[\u03c9c ]\u22120.5 = (\u03c3)0.5 [1 \u2212 (7/2)/\u03c3 2 \u2212 (21/2)/\u03c3 3 \u2212 ...]\n\nwhere \u03c3 = (2d \u2212 1). They summed this series, truncating\nappropriately, to estimate the sequence of Tc (\u00b1J) values\nfor the bimodal \u00b1J interaction in different dimensions.\nThey obtained satisfactory agreement with the high temperature series values which had just been been evaluated\nfor this interaction5,6,7 . More recent high temperature series work2,8 gives values consistent with the earlier series\nestimates for the bimodal distribution.\nFor present purposes the important step of Singh and\nFisher was the next one : they state that for an arbitrary\ninteraction distribution that we will label X, the mean\nover the interaction distribution Jij (X) of\n\u03c9c = htanh2 [Jij (X)/Tc (X)]i\n\n(An alternative definition of kurtosis, sometimes referred\nto as the excess kurtosis, corresponds to K \u2212 3 which\nleads to a zero value for the Gaussian distribution. For\npresent purposes it turns out that the the definition in\nEq. (1) is more convenient.) Extensive high temperature\nseries calculations by Daboul, Chang and Aharony provide accurate values of Tc in dimensions d from 8 to 4\nwhich are consistent with this phenomenological rule in\neach dimension2 .\nExploiting an approach due to Singh and Fisher3 I\nshow rigorously that in the high dimension limit the ordering temperature of near neighbour ISGs drops linearly with the kurtosis of the interaction distribution,\nand find excellent quantitative agreement between the\nSingh-Fisher predictions and the data of Daboul et al2\nin dimensions 7 and 8. At lower dimensions the linear\nrelation no longer applies strictly but the trend remains\nand the kurtosis can still be taken to be an appropriate\nparameter for ranking different systems.\nSingh and Fisher3 used a 1/d expansion technique\n(whose principle largely pre-dates RGT4 ) to evaluate Tc\nin ISGs as a function of dimension and of interaction distribution. On this approach and for the near neighbour\nISG with bimodal \u00b1J interactions, they define\n\u03c9c (\u00b1J) = tanh2 [J/Tc (\u00b1J)]\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nis the same for all distributions to order 1/\u03c3 2 . This is\nan implicit equation for Tc (X) once \u03c9c is known. The\nleading deviation was given as\n[\u03c9c (X) \u2212 \u03c9c (\u00b1J)] = \u03c9c (\u00b1J)[1 \u2212 3(\u03bc2 \u2212 1)/\u03c3 3 )...] (5)\nwhere\n\u03bcn = htanh2n [Jij /Tc (X)]i/htanh2 [Jij /Tc (X)]in\n\n(6)\n\nIt turns out that the effect of this deviation term is numerically rather weak in all dimensions.\nIf d is high enough, Tc values will also be high ( in d = 8\nTc \u223c 3.6 in the examples discussed below) so the whole\nrange of [Jij /Tc (X)] values can be taken to be small and\nwe can evaluate tanh2 (x) for small arguments only. Now\ntanh2 (x) = x2 \u2212 (2/3)x4 + (17/45)x6...\n\n(7)\n\nso keeping only the two leading terms, Eq. (4) becomes\n2\n4\n\u03c9c = hJij\n(X)i/Tc (X)2 \u2212 (2/3)hJij\n(X)i/Tc4\n\n(8)\n\nAs all ISG interaction distributions are normalized such\n2\nthat hJij\n(X)i = 1 and in the high d limit \u03c9c is independent of distribution,\n\u03c9c = 1/Tc(X)2 \u2212 (2/3)K(X)/(\u03c9cTc (X)4 )\n\n(9)\n\n\f2\n\n3,70\n\n3,40\n\n3,68\n\n3,38\n3,36\n\n3,66\n\n3,34\n3,64\n3,32\n3,30\n\n3,60\n\nTc\n\nTc\n\n3,62\n\n3,28\n\n3,58\n\n3,26\n\n3,56\n\n3,24\n\n3,54\n\n3,22\n3,20\n\n3,52\n\n3,18\n\n3,50\n\n3,16\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\n1,0\n\nkurtosis\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\nkurtosis\n\nFIG. 1: (Colour on line) Tc estimates for near neighbour interaction ISGs in dimension 8 from high temperature series data,\nDaboul it et al2 (black squares), the Singh-Fisher3 estimates\n(see text) (green triangles), and the leading approximation\nEq.

To the\nsame level of approximation the equation can finally be\nrewritten\n\nsmall argument approximation gives calculated points\nwhich are in almost perfect agreement with the Daboul\net al data in these dimensions. The weak deviation from\nthe straight line for K = 3 (the Gaussian distribution) is\ndue to the error introduced by truncating Eq. (7) in the\nwings of the Gaussian.\nBy dimension 5, figure 3, the first order approximation has become much poorer as could be expected a priori because the small argument development is no longer\nvalid in this lower dimension, where the Tc values are\nlower. There are weak deviations of the Singh-Fisher estimates (without the small argument approximation) from\nthe high temperature series data points, meaning that\nEq. (5) is no longer accurately obeyed, either because\nhigher order terms give non-negligible contributions or\nmore fundamentally because the 1/\u03c3 expansion becomes\ninaccurate at lower dimensions. As pointed out by Singh\nand Fisher their expansion \"is at best asymptotic and\noptimum estimates come by truncating after the smallest term\"3 , a procedure which introduces uncertainties at\nlower dimensions. Nevertheless the general trend of decreasing Tc with increasing kurtosis is still clearly present.\nFinally for d = 4 the small argument approximation\nto the Singh-Fisher expressions is certainly inappropriate\nbut one can again evaluate the full Singh-Fisher ordering\ntemperature estimates through numerical integration. In\nthis dimension ordering temperatures have also been estimated independently by simulations, using various complementary methods. These include a technique relying on consistency between dynamic and static critical\nparameters1, domain wall analysis10 , and Binder param-\n\nTc (X, d) = (1/\u03c9c (d))0.5 [1 \u2212 K(X)\u03c9c (d)/3]\n\n(10)\n\nThis should be exact in the limit of high d and small\nto moderate kurtosis. The critical temperature should\nthen vary linearly with the kurtosis of the distribution\nK(X), with a slope which is given by [\u03c9c (d)]0.5 /3. \u03c9c (d)\ncan be fixed if one Tc (X) (generally the bimodal value)\nis known.\nI calibrate the single free parameter \u03c9c (d) by using the\nDaboul et al value for Tc (\u00b1J) in each dimension (the\nSingh-Fisher 1/\u03c3 series Tc (\u00b1J) values are in fact very\nclose to the Daboul et al values), except in dimension\n4 where the error bar on the Daboul et al value is high\nand I calibrate with the best simulation value. The \u03c9c\nvalues used are 0.069877, 0.08251, 0.1395 and 0.2208 in\ndimensions 8, 7, 5 and 4 respectively. The distributions\nstudied by Daboul et al were the bimodal, double triangle, uniform and Gaussian with K = 1, 4/3, 9/5 and 3\nrespectively.

In the two cases (bimodal\nand Gaussian interaction distributions) where simulation\nresults using different methods exist, agreement between\nthe various simulation estimates is excellent, see Table\nI. In addition, the Tc values have been studied in d = 4\n(and d = 3) using a Migdal-Kadanoff (MK) approach9\nwhere the optimum size b\u2217 of the MK renormalization\ncell is chosen by intrapolating the number of segments b\nin an MK branch until Tc (M K) is equal to Tc for the \u00b1J\ndistribution. Tc (M K) values for the other distributions\nare then estimated with this same b\u2217 . For d = 4 the optimum intrapolated value for b was found to be b\u2217 = 2.499\n. The different Tc estimates are given in Table 1 and\nare shown in Figure 4 where the same general trend once\nmore appears. It can be seen that while the Singh-Fisher\nvalues and the MK values lie close to but not precisely on\nthe series and simulation points, the agreement between\nthe simulation estimates and the series values is excellent.\nAs the simulation calculations are necessarily carried out\non samples of moderate size (a maximum of L = 12 up\nto now in dimension 4 ), a priori there might have been\na lingering suspicion that the Tc estimates from simulations could somehow be intrinsically in error because of\ncorrections to finite size scaling that had not been properly taken into account. Because the series estimates are\nnot subject to this type of error, the agreement beween\nthe two sets of quite independent Tc values lays this suspicion to rest. One can have confidence that at least in\ndimension d = 4 the simulation estimates of Tc (X) ( and\nin particular those using the static/dynamic consistency\ntechnique1 which are the most complete ) are intrinsically\n\n3,0\n\n3,5\n\n4,0\n\n4,5\n\n5,0\n\n5,5\n\n6,0\n\n6,5\n\nkurtosis\n\nFIG. 4: (Colour on line) Tc estimates for near neighbour interaction ISGs in dimension 4 from high temperature series\ndata, Daboul it et al2 (black squares), the Singh-Fisher3 estimates (see text) (green triangles), simulation estimates1 (red\ncircles), and MK estimates with b\u2217 = 2.499 (blue inverted\ntriangles).

(4) ) is almost distribution independent\nfor fixed dimension d. The linear dependence of Tc (X)\non the kurtosis K(X) with a slope [\u03c9c (d)]0.5 /3 becomes\nexact in the high dimension limit and is still a close approximation in high but finite dimensions (d = 8 and 7).\nEven at moderate d (d = 5 and 4), the general trend\nstill holds so the ranking of distributions by their kurtosis remains physically appropriate in agreement with the\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nL.W.

( It is nevertheless\nconceivable that for low dimensions differences between\ndistributions could lead to situations such that two distributions with identical kurtoses would have marginally\ndifferent Tc values. For the moment the number of different distributions that have been studied is very limited\nso this possibility has never been put to the test). In\ndimension d = 4 which is the only dimension where appropriate data is available for both simulations and series\nmeasurements, simulation estimates of ordering temperatures are in excellent agreement with the series values\nwhich confirms that the simulation estimates, in particular those based on the consistency between dynamic and\nstatic critical parameters1 , are accurate and reliable.\nAcknowledgements : I would like to thank A.
