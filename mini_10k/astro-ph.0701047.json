We summarize some of the new results from contributions made to the Galactic\nCentre workshop that took place in Bad Honnef, Germany, on April 18-22 2006.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the web definitions of \"a center\" reads: \"A place of concentrated activity, influence,\nor importance\" (http://www.answers.com/topic/center). Another adds, \"a point of origin from\nwhich ideas or influences originate\". We believe this conference on the Galactic Center is a great\nillustration of these definitions for several important fields of research in modern Astrophysics.\nWhile it is very hard to summarize all the exciting work presented at this meeting, we shall try\nto give the reader a glimpse of the state of the art of the field as of April 2006. We shall cite the\nresults by simply the name of the first author on the corresponding proceedings article, except\nfor papers external to the proceedings.\n2. The young massive stars in the central parsec\nYoung massive \"He-I\" stars dominate the power output of the central half-parsec\n[Krabbe et al. 1995] of our Galaxy. \"Standard\" models of star formation are not easily\napplicable here due to a huge tidal field of the central object at R = 0.1 pc distances from\nSgr A\u2217 . The required gas density is nH > 1011 cm\u22123 (R/0.1pc)\u22123 . In the last several years, a\nsignificant breakthrough in understanding of these stars has taken place. We now know that ...\n\u2022 These young stars are not dynamically relaxed (Levin & Beloborodov 2003). They appear\nto form one (J. Lu, A. Ghez) or arguably two stellar disks (T. Paumard and also Genzel et\nal. 2003).\n\u2022 There are inner and outer radii that seem to encompass most of the massive early type\nstars, R \u223c 0.03 and R \u223c 0.5 pc, respectively. (The \"S\" stars inside of 0.03 pc are discussed\nseparately below.)\n\u2022 This implies that the stars are very unlikely to have migrated from outside, thus suggesting\nan in situ star formation, despite the tidal shear produced by Sgr A*. The previous debate\nabout whether the massive stars in the central parsec formed in situ or whether they\nare remnant of a tidally disrupted cluster brought into the Galactic center by dynamical\nfriction is not entirely concluded, but the latter hypothesis seems very strongly constrained,\nrequiring a rather heavy burden of extreme assumptions.\n\u2022 The young stars surrounding Sgr A* are then likely to be the first observational evidence\nfor star formation in massive gaseous disks in the inner parsecs of galactic nuclei (Levin,\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nPaumard). Recurring in situ star formation was suggested to occur in the GC due to a\nperiodic inflow of gas from the Circumnuclear Disk (inner few parsecs) by Morris et al.\n(1999).\nThe inner radius might be indicative of the minimum distance at which star formation can\nstill occur, and is consistent with theoretical predictions (Levin, Nayakshin).\nNIR observations and X-ray constraints suggest that the IMF of young stars is very topheavy (Paumard, Nayakshin). Such an IMF might be the result of inefficient cooling in the\noptically thick conditions in the disk (Nayakshin, Levin). The dynamically hot condition\nof the disk (i.e., likely strong turbulence, as evidenced by the current circumnuclear disk),\nand the presumably strong magnetic field might also have this effect on the IMF (Morris\n1993).\nThe exact orbits of the stars in the stellar ring(s) remain a subject of debate. The\nacceleration limit (J. Lu) places lower limits on the eccentricities of some of the young\nstars, some of which are rather high. This spells trouble for the simplest version of the in\nsitu model, i.e., the model of a gaseous disk in circular rotation about Sgr A\u2217 .\nNumerical simulations, however, show that stars may also form via gravitational\nfragmentation in an eccentric ring of gas (Sanders 1998; Nayakshin). Interestingly, an\ninitially flat eccentric disk of stars becomes geometrically thick much faster than a flat\ncircular disk (Nayakshin et al. 2006) due to orbital precession (Touma). Thus, the fact that\nthe second feature in the stellar velocity distribution of young stars in the GC (the counterclockwise \"disk\") is more geometrically thick than the clockwise disk may be naturally\nexplained by the different rates of orbital precession.\nNew observations constrain stellar effective temperatures with increasing reliability. There\nappear to be no stars more massive than about 60 M\u2299 , which would be consistent with the\nage of the Sgr A\u2217 young star cluster (F. Martins).\nThe star cluster IRS13E is a mysterious collection of several very massive young stars and\nperhaps a couple dozen lighter ones, so it may be the surviving core of a massive cluster\nwhich has been almost entirely tidally stripped (T. Paumard). Indeed, its dynamics place\nit in the counter-rotating stellar disk, so it may provide evidence that that disk has resulted\nfrom the disruption of a dense cluster. However, the visible mass of IRS13E is insufficient\nto bind it gravitationally. An alternative to the rather implausible explanation that the\ncluster core is only now making its first pass near the central black hole is that it is bound\nby an intermediate mass black hole. However, the X-ray evidence favors colliding stellar\nwinds over black hole accretion. IRS13E-like objects are in fact not formed naturally in\ncurrent in situ star formation simulations (Nayakshin). Understanding IRS13E is therefore\ncrucial for understanding of the overall star formation event in the GC.\nOther co-moving groups of young stars might be present (R. Schoedel) in the inner parsec.\nIRS16SW appears to be an eclipsing contact binary with two \u223c 50 M\u2299 stars orbiting with\na period of about 18 days (T. Ott, M. Rafelski, F. Martins et al. 2006).\n\n3. S-stars in the central \u223c 0.03 parsec\nThe so-called \"S-stars\" are the stars observed in the inner arcsecond in projection from Sgr A*,\ni.e., in the inner region that excludes the He-I stars discussed above. These stars are now\nspectroscopically resolved to be less massive but nonetheless still quite young B-type stars. The\nparadox of youth is orders of magnitude more severe for these stars than for the He-I stars.\nFurthermore, the orientations of the orbits of these stars appear to be consistent with isotropic,\nso they do not point to any organized formation mechanism such as a disk. A large fraction of\nthe S-stars has relatively eccentric orbits, although this fraction is difficult to determine reliably\n\n\fbecause of selection effects. There is also a strong selection effect toward studying only the\nbrightest sources, although more stars are emerging all the time, so this situation is improving.\nWhile there were many theoretical suggestions for the origin of these stars, there does not yet\nappear to be a clear winner among them. Gravitational instability of a massive accretion disk\nis not predicted to form stars closer in than about 1\u2032\u2032 , and hence the in-situ star formation for\nS-stars is not favored. Some of the new ideas emerged from the meeting on the origin of these\nstars are:\n\u2022 Massive perturbers, such as massive molecular clouds or star clusters, can significantly\nenhance the rate at which massive young binaries diffuse on nearly radial orbits (H. Perets).\nIf these binaries are then disrupted, a population of stars similar to S-stars might be created.\n\u2022 The population of remnants of disrupted binaries would have very large eccentricities\n(e \u2248 0.99; Y. Levin). Ordinary N-body relaxation is too slow to evolve the orbits, which\nwould then be a serious problem for the model, as several of the S-stars have moderated\neccentricities (e < 0.5). Resonant relaxation (C. Hopman, T. Alexander), might however\nresult in the orbital evolution that is rapid enough to explain those \"rouge\" S-stars.\n\u2022 Although this was not discussed at the meeting, we note that the relatively young, ultrahigh velocity stars now being found in the galactic halo, whose orbits are consistent with\nbeing purely radial, are widely seen to result from binary encounters either with the central\nblack hole or with stellar mass black holes in a central cluster. Such process may be a\npromising way of producing the S-stars as the former companions of the ultra-high velocity\nstars (O'Leary & Loeb 2006).\n\u2022 Spectra of the S-stars are consistent with those of normal B-type stars (F. Martins), possibly\nruling out the model in which the S-stars are created by tidal disruption of giants on nearly\nradial orbits.\n4. NIR/X-ray flares from Sgr A\u2217\nAt the time of the last workshop on the Galactic Center, Sgr A\u2217 had not yet been discovered at\ninfrared wavelengths, and the first observations of X-ray flares had only recently been announced\n(Baganoff et al. 2001). Millimeter-wavelength flares had been reported already at the 1998\nTucson workshop, and continued follow-up work on that was reported here by A. Miyazaki.\nSince that time, the characteristics of the emission have become clearer, and theories for the\nspectrum of Sgr A\u2217 have been elaborated to account for that (F. Yuan). However, this study\nis still at a very early stage, both observationally and theoretically, as the frequency, spectrum,\nlocation, and cause of the flares all remain widely debated. X-ray flares are well-defined events,\nrising above the feeble, marginally extended (\u223c 1.5\") quiescent emission almost once per day.\nThe near-infrared intensity variations of more than an order of magnitude appear to be essentially\ncontinuous red noise variations, rather than being well-defined \"flares\". The common use of the\nterm \"flare\" in the NIR typically refers to a broad intensity maximum in the continuous light\ncurve.\n\u2022 The locations of NIR flares are offset from the dynamical center of the Sgr A\u2217 star cluster\nby no more than 2 mas \u223c 2 \u00d7 1014 cm. This implies they do originate from Sgr A\u2217 (S.\nTrippe).\n\u2022 There is a dusty clump of gas very near the line of sight to Sgr A\u2217 , which may influence\nthe mid-infrared fluxes of Sgr A\u2217 during flares (Ghez et al. 2005; A. Eckart).\n\u2022 There is not yet universal agreement about whether the spectral index observed during\nflares is correlated with the flare luminosity, but much recent effort has gone into measuring\nthe NIR spectrum and its relationship to the X-ray emission properties (S. Hornstein; S.\n\n\fGillessen; A. Krabbe; A. Eckart). Hornstein finds no variability of the NIR spectral index\nof Sgr A\u2217 from 1.6 to 4.6 \u03bcm.\n\u2022 Simultaneous observations of Sgr A\u2217 at infrared, radio and X-ray wavelengths have been\nattempted since 2002, and a few events have been captured in multiple bands (A. Eckart;\nYusef-Zadeh et al. 2006). The present indications are that X-ray flares are accompanied\nby NIR maxima, although the statistics on this can only be improved. This strengthens\ntheories in which the same population of electrons is responsible for both the NIR and\nX-ray events, but probably by virtue of different processes (synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton, respectively).\n\u2022 A breakthrough has occurred with the first measurements of the polarization of the NIR\nemission from Sgr A\u2217 and of its variability (A. Eckart). The polarization shows much more\ntime structure than the total intensity, suggesting that it is affected by the varying direction\nof motion of the nonthermally emitting gas. A similar phenomenon is also evidenced\nat submillimeter wavelengths (D. Marrone). Polarization variability time scales of \u223c 20\nminutes are particularly intriguing in view of the occasional periodicities that have been\nclaimed for the total IR (Genzel et al. 2003) and X-ray intensities (G. Belanger), and in\nview of the coincidence of this time scale with the period of the innermost stable circular\norbit around a rotating black hole of 3.6 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 . Theoretical models suggest that\npolarised emission of a rotating blob near Sgr A\u2217 could produce characteristic signatures\nthat would allow observers to constrain the spin of Sgr A\u2217 (L. Meyer; A. Broderick).\n\u2022 A compelling 22-minute periodicity was inferred from the data on one rather long X-ray\nflare observed with XMM (G. Belanger). The duration of the entire flare was only about 7\ntimes this period, so the analysis of the statistics of this event is an important and delicate\nissue. The \u223c15 other flares seen with Chandra and XMM have not yet shown any significant\nperiodicity, so any such modulation of the X-ray flare signal is apparently uncommon.\n5. New X-ray results on the GC\n\u2022 The Suzaku telescope, formerly known as AstroE2, can now distinguish between rather\nclosely lying X-ray lines. K. Koyama reported Suzaku results on the Fe K-alpha line at\n\u223c 6.7 keV in the GC diffuse emission. It is found that the centroid energy is 6.680 keV,\nwhich favors the thermal collisional origin of that line, rather than its being due to charge\nexchange with cosmic rays (in which the line energy would be 6.666 keV). The ratio of\nX-ray line intensities shows that plasma emitting the diffuse emission is in near ionization\nequilibrium. Also, the emitting medium does not have a large bulk motion with respect to\nSgr A\u2217 .\n\u2022 The diffuse X-ray emission presented a puzzle for many years, as the plasma emitting it\nwould be too hot to be confined by the gravity of the GC, and would require an enormous\nenergy source to maintain (R. Belmont). R. Warwick suggests that the diffuse X-ray\nemission is produced by a population of cataclysmic variables (CVs) rather than by a hot\ndiffuse plasma. This parallels the recent results of Revnivtsev et al. (2006) on the larger\nscale Galactic ridge X-ray emission, but conflicts with the conclusions of Muno et al. (2004)\nand Koyama et al. (2006).\n\u2022 Association of the \"neutral\" 6.4 keV Fe K-\u03b1 line with the 4.5 \u2212 6 keV continuum emission\nargues for origin of most of that emission in local cosmic ray ionization (R. Warwick), rather\nthan photo-ionization.\n\u2022 Sgr B2 cloud's 6.4 keV Fe K-\u03b1 X-ray emission, and that in the newly found \"X-ray reflection\nnebula\", are however the results of photo-ionization (K. Koyama).\n< 1 \u2212 2 M seem to be deficient by a\n\u2022 Chandra observations show that low mass stars M \u223c\n\u2299\nfactor of up to ten in both the central star cluster (S. Nayakshin) and the Arches star cluster\n\n\f(D. Wang). The extent to which the apparently top-heavy MF of the Arches cluster is owed\nto the preferential tidal stripping of its original low mass stars is not yet clear.\n6. The central molecular zone and star formation\n\u2022 Gas in the CMZ is particularly warm, dense, and turbulent, with temperatures ranging\nup to several hundred degrees K (N. Rodriguez-Fernandez). About 10-30% of the column\ndensity of the CMZ can be attributed to a hot (\u223c150 K) photodissociation region. It is not\nyet possible to decide definitively among the possible heating mechanisms proposed for the\nrest of the gas, or even whether the right mechanism has yet been proposed. Observations\nof an unusually high relative abundance of SiO in CMZ clouds imply that shocks affect the\nchemical abundances there.\n\u2022 The study of the CMZ is a mature field, with many surveys done in past decades. Therefore,\nit was remarkable to see in a recent CO survey some altogether new morphological features:\nvery large molecular loops rising far above the Galactic plane (Y. Fukui). The shapes\nand velocity fields of these features are reasonably interpreted as having been produced by\nthe Parker instability, although it remains unclear why the loop-like magnetic structures\nresulting from that instability would have a molecular form.\n\u2022 The Spitzer/IRAC survey has provided a wealth of detail that will be mined for a long\ntime to come (S. Stolovy). Hot dust and PAH emission are ubiquitous throughout the\ninner few hundred parsecs, pointing the way to sites of star formation activity. The close\ncorrespondence between the IRAC images and the radio images of HII regions \u2013 notably\nnear the Quintuplet Cluster \u2013 illustrate the strong interaction between the luminous, hot\nstars and gas in the CMZ (A. Cotera).\n\u2022 Star formation in the CMZ is a currently active process that has been ongoing quasicontinuously since the formation of the Galaxy (Figer 2007). It has been punctuated\nrecently, and very likely at a steady rate in the past, by the formation of massive, compact\nclusters, three of which have formed within the past 107 years. Inevitable tidal dissolution\nmakes it very difficult to identify older clusters than that. One of the important outstanding\nproblems in Galactic center research is to identify the mechanism for the formation of such\nmassive clusters as the Arches and Quintuplet.\n7. The Galactic center magnetic field\nTwo important puzzles that emerge from this workshop are the strength and the dispersion of\nthe magnetic field in the central 100 parsecs (M. Morris). The paradigm suggested some time\nago by the presence of numerous, vertically-oriented, nonthermal radio filaments was a pervasive\nmilligauss field having a relatively small dispersion in both strength and direction. The field\nwas hypothesized to be highlighted by synchrotron radiation only at the places where relativistic\nelectrons have been injected. The pervasive milligauss field has been called into question based\non recent studies of low-frequency synchrotron radiation (T. LaRosa), and using the minimum\nenergy assumption, which may be inapplicable to this situation. The debate about the field\nstrength hinges also on the relatively short synchrotron lifetime of the emitting electrons in the\nstrong field case, and therefore whether there exists a reacceleration mechanism. Others have\nargued that the radio filaments represent local concentrations of the field caused by turbulence or\nby some transitory current structure. However, these proposals encounter difficulties with time\nscales or geometry. Additional constraints on the magnetic field can perhaps be supplied by the\nhigh energy results from INTEGRAL (G. Belanger) and HESS (J. Hinton). What is now needed\nis a direct measurement of the magnetic field; submillimeter measurements of polarized line and\ncontinuum emission may settle this issue before the next workshop. Also, current theoretical\nefforts to model cosmic rays and their synchrotron emission will soon be informing this debate.\n\n\fIt is an important issue to settle, because a strong magnetic field could play a vital role in many\nof the phenomena observed in the Galactic center.\n8. Other interesting results\n\u2022 Adaptive optics near-infrared observations of the Arches cluster also suggest that its IMF\nis top-heavy (A. Stolte, S. Kim). The IMF is mass-segregated as a function of the projected\ndistance from the center of the cluster.\n\u2022 The prominent mid-infrared source AFGL 5376 appears to have resulted from a strong,\n\u223c100-pc shock between two vertically oriented molecular systems. The association of this\nstructure with magnetic radio filaments (J. Staguhn) raises the possibility that the shock\nis associated with a region of strongly compressed magnetic field.\n\u2022 The Sgr A East supernova remnant, which encircles the GC in projection, and is probably\nnot very far behind Sgr A\u2217 is impacting the dense molecular material surrounding it, giving\nrise to 1720 MHz OH maser emission (L. Sjouwerman) and to shocked H2 line emission (S.\nLee) at several points around its periphery. The impact upon the 50 km s\u22121 cloud gives\nrise to a compressed ridge (M. Tsuboi). The energetics and the age of this supernova are\nstill under discussion. While some consider it to be a normal Type II supernova, Others\nsuggest that it may have resulted from a much more energetic hypernova. Similarly, age\nestimates for the remnant now range between 1700 and 10,000 years.\n\u2022 The mass of the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) , which orbits Sgr A\u2217 and has an inner radius of\n\u223c1 pc, has been debated for some time, with estimates ranging from 104 to a few \u00d7 105 M\u2299 .\nWith the SMA results of M. Montero-Castano on J = 4-3 HCN emission, it now appears\nthat, while hot gas is characteristic of the CND, the density is not uniformly as high as had\npreviously been estimated (Christopher et al. 2005). Consequently, the CND mass may lie\nnear the lower end of the above range. The CND is a likely reservoir for future accretion\nactivity onto SgrA*, so this result has important implications for the long-term accretion\nrate. The CND also serves as a test case for the clumpy medium model of T. Beckert for\ndusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs.\n\u2022 There appears to be a low extinction channel along the Galactic plane, from NE to SW\nwhich points to the minicavity (R. Sch\u00f6del). If ascribed to an outflow from Sgr A\u2217 it\nagrees with the model of K. Mu\u017ei\u0107 for the proper motions of mid-IR filaments, and with\nthe orientation of the polarization vector found by A. Eckart.\n\u2022 The GC distance determined using the orbital fits to the proper motions of the S-stars, in\nconcert with measurements of their radial velocities, could be as small as 7.4 kiloparsec (T.\nOtt), although ongoing efforts are warranted to eliminate astrometric biases occurring near\nperiapse and during close passages by other stars.\n\u2022 Sophisticated Monte-Carlo modeling of dynamical mass segregation in the GC predicts\nabout 20 thousand stellar-mass black holes in the inner parsec (M. Freitag).\n< 2 M and older than 109 years,\n\u2022 Horizontal branch/Red clump stars, i.e. stars with M \u223c\n\u2299\nseem to be missing in the inner 9\", possibly due to their expulsion from that region by\nstellar mass black holes (T. Alexander).\n\u2022 Numerical models of stellar wind accretion onto Sgr A\u2217 predict a strong variability of the\naccretion rate (J. Cuadra) on time scales of tens to hundreds of years. The implications of\nthese results for the structure of the inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow (F. Yuan)\nare at the moment not clear. Radio evidence gathered over a long term with the VLA\nindicates that there has been a secular change in the low-frequency turnover frequency (T.\nAn), suggesting a variable mass flux in the stellar winds which feed into the accretion flow.\nThese variations would modulate the opacity of the local absorbing medium.\n\n\f\u2022 Moving toward higher frequencies so that the \u03bb2 dependence of the size of the elliptical\nscattering disk is minimized, several VLBI groups are reporting an intrinsic size of for the\nradio source, as well as its variation with wavelength (G. Bower, Z-Q. Shen, T. Krichbaum).\nThe intrinsic size at 3mm is \u223c15 Schwarzschild radii, consistent with equating the dominant\nvariability time scales reported at that wavelength with the dynamical time at that radius\n(Mauerhan et al. 2005). There is still some discrepancy between the suggested wavelengthdependences of the intrinsic source size: \u03bb1.1 (Shen) to \u03bb1.6 (Bower).\nThere is enthusiasm in this community for the future use of VLBI techniques at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths, where the scattering disk will presumably be substantially\nsmaller than the source. In one of the next few meetings, we can perhaps expect to witness\nimages of the shadow of the black hole's event horizon. As A. Broderick shows, the theorists\nare ready for that.\nAcknowledgments\nThe conference organizers, and especially Rainer Sch\u00f6del, must be thanked for organizing\nthis workshop, running it amazingly well and problem-free, which allowed the participants to\nconcentrate on the exciting science of the galactic Center.\nReferences\n[1] Baganoff, F.K., Bautz, M.W., Brandt, W.N., Chartas, G., Feigelson, E.D., Garmire, G.P., Maeda, Y., Morris,\nM.R., Ricker, G.R., Townsley, L.K. & Walter, F. 2001, Nature, 413, 45\n[2] Christopher, M.H., Scoville, N.Z., Stolovy, S.R. & Yun, M.S. 2005, ApJ 622, 346\n[3] Figer, D.F. 2007, in Massive Stars: From Pop III and GRBs to the Milky Way, ed: M.
