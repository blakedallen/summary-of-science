Introduction\nRecently significant research has been carried out in the field of zircon-type\northovanades (AVO4, A = trivalent atom) due to their wide practical applications.\nOrthovanadates are well known for birefringent materials and optical polarizers. These\nmaterials are potential candidates for laser-host materials and also find applications in other\nfields such as cathodoluminescent, thermophosphors, scintillators, phosphors, and nuclearwaste storage materials [1-3]. In general, the AVO4 orthovanadaes crystallizes in two\npolymorphs, a tetragonal zircon-type structure [space group (SG): I41/amd] [4] and a\nmonoclinic monazite-type (space group: P21/n) [5]. Zircon structure is composed of\nalternating edge-sharing AO8 dodecahedra and VO4 tetrahedra forming chains parallel to the\nc-axis, while in the monazite structure AO9 polyhedra are edge-shared with VO4 tetrahedra\nalong the c-axis (see Fig. 1).\nThe phase stability of lanthanide-based ABO4 compounds depends upon the A/B\ncation size ratio, and those with large ionic radius, like LaVO4, crystallize in monazite\nstructure. The compound CeVO4, with Ce having smaller ionic radius than La, crystallizes in\nthe zircon structure, although it is located close to the boundary of zircon and monazite\nstructures. Hence, the zircon phase is expected to undergo a structural phase transition at a\nrelatively low pressure compared to other orthovanadates. In view of the nature of the\nstructural phase transitions in these compounds it is quite imperative to understand the\nbehavior of the zircon structured orthovanadates under hydrostatic compression and verify\nwhether the cation A radius plays any vital role in the structural phase transitions. As the\nmatter of fact, most of the rare-earth orthovanadates have been observed to undergo\nirreversible zircon to scheelite phase transition [6].\n\nHowever, rare-earth-based zircon\n\ncompounds with relatively large ionic radii, like CeVO4, NdVO4 and PrVO4, have not been\ninvestigated so far.\n\n2\n\n\fRecent high-pressure (HP) measurements performed in orthophosphates evidence the\nimportance of the cation A ionic radius in the sequence of structural phase transitions. Raman\nspectroscopy measurements and lattice-dynamic calculations supported by x-ray diffraction\n(XRD) in TbPO4 indicate a zircon to monoclinic phase transition at 9.5 GPa [7, 8]. Similarly\nan XRD investigation in orthophosphates, viz. YPO4 and ErPO4, reports a zircon to monazite\nphase transition in both compounds [9]. On the other hand, ScPO4, YbPO4 and LuPO4\nundergo reversible zircon to scheelite phase transition [10, 11]. Thus, it is a key issue to find\nwhat factor governs both zircon to scheelite and zircon to monazite phase transitions in\northovanadates and orthophosphates. In the present investigation we report XRD and Raman\nscattering measurements in CeVO4, the mineral wakefieldite-(Ce), up to 12.0 and 15.9 GPa,\nrespectively, together with ab initio calculations.\nII. Experimental details\nCeVO4 samples were prepared by solid-state reaction of appropriate amounts of\npredried Ce2O3 (Indian Rare Earth Ltd. 99%) and V2O5 (Alfa-Aesar 99%). Homogeneous\nmixtures of the reactants were pelletized and heated at 800\u00b0C for 24 h and then cooled to\nambient temperature. Further, the pellets were reground and heated again at 1100\u00b0C for 24 h.\nThe sample obtained was characterized by XRD as a single phase of CeVO4 of zircon-type\nstructure.\nAngle-dispersive powder XRD measurements both at ambient and at HP were\nrecorded on the 135 mm Atlas CCD detector placed at 110 mm from the sample of a Xcalibur\ndiffractometer (Oxford Diffraction Limited) using K\u03b11: K\u03b12 molybdenum radiation. The Xray beam was collimated to a diameter of 300 \u03bcm. The same set-up was used previously to\nsuccessfully characterize the HP phases in ABO4 oxides up to 20 GPa [12]. On the other\nhand, Raman measurements both at ambient and HP were performed in the backscattering\ngeometry using 632.8 nm HeNe laser and a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM high-resolution\n\n3\n\n\fmicrospectrometer in combination with a thermoelectric-cooled multichannel chargedcoupled device (CCD) detector with spectral resolution below 2 cm-1.\nFor HP measurements on CeVO4, finely grounded powder sample of CeVO4, along\nwith 2-\u03bcm diameter ruby balls, was loaded in a pre-indented steel gasket with a 200-\u03bcm\ndiameter hole inside a diamond-anvil cell (DAC). A 4:1 methanol-ethanol mixture was used\nas pressure-transmitting medium [13, 14]. The pressure was determined using the rubyfluorescence technique [15]. A modified Merrill-Bassett DAC was used for XRD\nmeasurements and a membrane-type DAC was used for Raman measurements.\nWe have also performed compression measurements in CeVO4 at ambient and hightemperature using steel-belted Bridgman-type opposed tungsten-carbide anvils with a tip of\n15 mm in diameter [16]. The sample was contained in a pyrophyllite chamber which consists\nof two pyrophyllite gaskets of optimized thickness (0.5 mm each) in split gasket geometry.\nCubic boron nitride was the pressure medium used in these experiments. To increase the\ntemperature we used a graphite heater [17]. Temperature was measured using a steel shielded\nK-type thermocouple and pressure by the calibration of the load applied to the anvils against\nHP resistivity transitions in Bi, Yb, CdTe and n-type InSe [18]. Effects of pressure in the\nthermocouple were neglected. Recovered samples from different experimental runs were\nanalyzed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.\nIII. Theoretical method and computational details\nIt is well known that ab initio methods have allowed detailed studies of the energetics\nof materials under high pressures [19]. Total-energy calculations were done within the\nframework of the density-functional theory (DFT) and the Kohn-Sham equations were solved\nusing the projector-augmented wave (PAW) [20, 21] method as implemented in the Vienna\nab initio simulation package (VASP) [22]. We use a plane-wave energy cutoff of 520 eV to\nensure a high precision in the calculations. It is known that DFT within the local-density\n\n4\n\n\fapproximation (LDA) or the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) often yields\nincorrect results for systems with f electrons with a small f orbital overlap and narrow f bands.\nThe implementation of the DFT+U method has been found to improve the results in the study\nof cerium compounds [23]. The exchange and correlation energy was described within the\nGGA in the PBEsol [24] prescription. The GGA+U method was used to account the strong\ncorrelation between the electrons in the Ce 4f shell on the basis of Dudarev's method [25]. In\nthis method the on-site Coulomb interaction, U (Hubbard term), and the on-site exchange\ninteraction, JH, are treated together as Ueff =U \u2013 JH. For our GGA+U calculations we have\nchosen a value U = 6 eV and JH = 1 eV for Ce atom. These values were chosen by\ncomparison with the electronic structure study of CeVO4 done by Da Silva et al. [26].\nMonkhorst-Pack scheme was employed for the Brillouin-zone (BZ) integrations [27] with the\ngrids 4x4x4, 4x4x2, and 4x4x3 for zircon, scheelite, and monazite phases, respectively. In the\nrelaxed equilibrium configuration, the forces are less than 4 meV/\u00c5 per atom in each of the\ncartesian directions. Lattice-dynamics calculations of phonon modes were performed at the\nzone centre (\u0413 point) of the BZ. The calculations provided information about the frequency,\nsymmetry and polarization vector of the vibrational modes in each structure. Highly\nconverged results on forces are required for the calculation of dynamical matrix of latticedynamics calculations. We use the direct force-constant approach (or supercell method) [28].\nThe construction of the dynamical matrix at the \u0413 point of the BZ is particularly simple and\ninvolves separate calculation of the forces in which a fixed displacement from the\nequilibrium configuration of the atoms within the primitive unit cell is considered. Symmetry\nfurther reduces the computational efforts by reducing the number of such independent\ndisplacements in the analyzed structures. Diagonalization of the dynamical matrix provides\nboth the frequencies of the normal modes and their polarization vectors. It allows us to\nidentify the irreducible representations and the character of phonon modes at the \u0413 point.\n\n5\n\n\fIV. Results\nA. High pressure XRD\nAt ambient conditions CeVO4 crystallizes in the zircon phase (SG: I41/amd, Z = 4).\nThe zircon structure can be described by CeO8 dodecahedrons with eight similar Ce-O\ndistances and isolated VO4 tetrahedrons (see Fig.1). Figure 2 shows the selective x-ray\ndiffraction patterns of CeVO4 at representative pressures. There were no noticeable changes\nin the diffraction pattern up to 4 GPa and the diffraction peaks could be indexed to zircon\nphase. At 5.5 GPa the appearance of many extra diffraction peaks were observed along with\nthe weak remnant (112) diffraction peak of the zircon phase, as shown by arrow in Fig. 2.\nThese changes in the diffraction patterns are indicative of a structural phase transition in\nCeVO4 at this pressure. The new diffraction peaks of CeVO4 could be assigned to the\nmonoclinic monazite phase (P21/n). On further increase of pressure the monazite phase was\nfound to be stable up to 12 GPa, which is the highest pressure reached in our XRD\nmeasurements. On release of pressure the monazite phase was quenched thus indicating the\nirreversible nature of the zircon-monazite phase transition. These results are in agreement\nwith Raman measurements and calculations presented in the next sections.\nThe Rietveld refinement of all the background corrected diffraction patterns was\ncarried out using Powdercell software [29]. The diffraction patterns up to 2\u03b8 = 18\u00b0 were used\nin order to avoid any kind of gasket interference in the structural refinements. At ambient\npressure the lattice parameters for zircon-structured CeVO4 are refined as a = 7.399 \u00c5, c =\n6.482 \u00c5, which are consistent with the ICSD card No. 66033. The lattice parameters and\nfractional coordinates of the zircon phase of CeVO4 are given in Table I and are also in good\nagreement with those reported in previous high-pressure and high-temperature XRD\nmeasurements by Range et al., a = 7.383 \u00c5, c = 6.485 \u00c5 [30].\n\n6\n\n\fThe pressure evolution of the lattice parameters and equation of state of CeVO4 in the\nzircon and monazite phase is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that in the zircon phase the aaxis is more compressible than the c-axis as is evident from the increase of the c/a ratio from\n0.878 at ambient pressure to 0.887 at 4 GPa. The linear compressibility of the c-axis (Kc =\n1.05 \u00d7 10-3 GPa-1) is smaller than that of the other two axes (Ka = Kb = 3.48 \u00d7 10-3 GPa-1).\nThese values are similar to those obtained in other zircon-type vanadates [6] and related\noxides [31]. Due to deterioration of diffraction patterns in the monazite phase beyond 5.5\nGPa, the value of \u03b2 angle refined at 5.5 GPa was kept constant for further refinements. A\ntypical Rietveld refinement fit of diffraction data at 7.2 GPa is shown in Figure 4 and the\nlattice parameters and fractional coordinates are presented in Table II. These parameters are\nin close agreement with lattice parameters reported in recent XRD measurements in monazite\nCePO4 [32]. In the monazite phase we have observed an anomalous behavior of the axial\ncompression. From Figure 4 it can be seen that a- and b-axis decrease with pressure while\nthe c-axis increases with pressure. A similar behavior was observed in pressure-induced\nmonazite-structured for orthophosphates [8, 9]. However, this behavior is in contrast with\nresults in monazite-type CePO4 and LaPO4 [9, 32]. The different axial compression of CeVO4\nand CePO4 could be attributed to the more distorted monazite structure of CeVO4 than that of\nCePO4. The reason is that the monazite phase of CeVO4 is induced by pressure while that of\nCePO4 occurs already at ambient pressure. Note that difference is found always when a HP\nmonazite is compared with an ambient pressure monazite. The zircon to monazite phase\ntransition in CeVO4 exhibits a volume collapse of 8.6 % at 4 GPa which is quite large\ncompared to those observed in orthophosphates [8, 10]. A fit of the volume vs. pressure data\nof the zircon phase to a second order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (B \u03010 = 4) gives bulk\nmodulus of 118.9 GPa. This value is the smallest one found in orthovanadates [6], thus\nindicating that CeVO4 is the most compressible orthovanadate to date. In the monazite phase,\n\n7\n\n\fvolume vs. pressure data fitted to third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state gives bulk\nmodulus B0 = 142 GPa and B \u03010 = 4.4, which is relatively close to the bulk modulus of\nmonazite-type CePO4 (B0 = 122 GPa) [32]. During the fitting we have excluded the pressurevolume data point collected at 12 GPa because it deviated from the systematic behavior of the\nrest of the data. A possible reason of it might be the assumption that the \u03b2 angle does not\nchange under compression, which could lead to a unit-cell volume miscalculation.\nThe occurrence of the zircon-monazite transition instead of the zircon-scheelite\ntransition is apparently in contradiction with results reported by Range et al. [30]. These\nauthors, who used a large-volume press, found that upon compression at room temperature\nzircon-type CeVO4 transforms to the scheelite phase. They only observed the occurrence of\nthe monazite phase under the combined effect of pressure and temperature. To corroborate\nthese results we have performed similar experiments using a large-volume press equipped\nwith Bridgman anvils. The obtained results from x-ray diffraction measurements performed\nfrom samples quenched from different pressures are shown in Fig. 5 and tabulated in Table\nIII. Our results show that zircon-type CeVO4 transforms to the scheelite phase at 4 GPa and\nto the monazite phase at the same pressure but at temperatures close to 600 oC. These results\nconfirm the results reported by Range et al. [30]. The main difference between these\nexperiments and the experiments performed using a DAC is that in the Bridgman cell a solid\npressure media is used; i.e. the non-unixial stresses are more important. Therefore, our results\nevidence that zircon-type CeVO4 undergoes a transformation to the scheelite structure at\nambient temperature under non-hydrostatic compression. At high temperatures, stresses are\nrelaxed and therefore the monazite phase can be obtained as in the DAC experiments. It is\ninteresting to note that in the Bridgman-cell experiments, both the monazite and the scheelite\nphases are quenchable to ambient conditions, which confirms the non-reversibility of both\ntransitions. The unit-cell parameters and atomic position of monazite-type and scheelite-type\n\n8\n\n\fCeVO4 at ambient conditions are summarized in Table IV. For the sake of comparison the\nlattice parameters of the monazite [30, 33] and scheelite phases [30] reported in earlier\nmeasurements are also given.\nB. Structural calculations\nThe calculated total energy (E) as a function of volume of three different phases of\nCeVO4 is shown in Figure 6(a). According with the calculations, the most stable phase at\nambient pressure is zircon. The calculated values of lattice parameters, fractional coordinates\nand bulk moduli for all the three phases are listed in Table V. These values are in good\nagreement with the experimental ones. The bulk modulus of the monazite phase is slightly\nunderestimated by the calculations. In particular the calculated B0 for monazite is 2% smaller\nthan in low-pressure zircon, which is unusual for a HP phase. The thermodynamic phase\ntransition between two structures occurs when the Gibbs free energy (G) is the same for both\nphases. In order to obtain the Gibbs free energy we use a quasi-harmonic Debye model that\nallows obtaining G at room temperature from calculations performed for T= 0 K [34]. Figure\n6(b) shows the pressure dependence of the Gibbs free energy difference at T = 300 K for the\nscheelite and the monazite phases with respect to the zircon phase, which is taken as\nreference. In calculations, at non-zero temperatures all vibrational contributions are included,\nin contrast with 0 K calculations which neglect the vibrational contribution, zero point energy\nThe calculations show a phase transition sequence with the formation of the monazite phase\nbeing prior to that of the scheelite phase, in good agreement with our experimental findings.\nCalculations also indicate that the monazite phase may transform to the scheelite phase at\nhigher pressures. At 300 K, the calculated phase-transition pressure for the zircon-tomonazite transition is 2 GPa and the theoretical phase transition pressure for the monazite-toscheelite transition is 3.9 GPa. Calculations done at 0 K and 600 K gave the same structural\nsequence, being the zircon-monazite transition pressure not affected by temperature.\n\n9\n\n\fHowever, the monazite-scheelite transition pressure increases with temperature, in agreement\nwith the experimental results reported by Range et al. [30]. This positive slope can be\nrationalized using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates differences in volumes (\u2206V) and\nentropy (\u2206S) across a phase boundary to the slope of the phase boundary in P-T space: dP/dT\n= \u2206S/\u2206V [35]. Since the volume per formula unit is smaller in scheelite than in monazite\nCeVO4, the positive slope of the monazite-scheelite phase boundary indicate that the\ntransition is also associated to an entropy decrease. To conclude this section we would like to\nmention that at 300 K, the calculated zircon-scheelite transition pressure agrees with the DAC\nexperiments; however in our experiment, we have recorded data till 16 GPa and we have\nfound no evidence for the monazite-to-scheeelite phase transition. A possible cause for the\nnon occurrence of the monazite-scheelite transition is the presence of kinetics barriers as\nobserved in other ABO4 compounds [36]. Consequently, the atomic displacements needed to\ntrigger the monazite-scheelite transition can only take place if the equilibrium transition\npressure is sufficiently overstepped. New XRD measurements at pressures beyond 15 GPa, at\ndifferent temperatures, are needed to check the possibility of the second phase transition.\nNote than under non hydrostatic compression the scheelite phase is found at 4 GPa, which\nsupports the theoretical results. Apparently, non-hydrostatic stresses reduce kinetic barriers in\nCeVO4. However, this subject is still open to new studies.\nC. Raman scattering\n(i) Zircon structured CeVO4\nAt ambient conditions, CeVO4 exists in the zircon structure (space group I41/amd and\npoint group D4h) with two formula units per primitive cell. Group theoretical analysis predicts\n12 Raman-active modes 2A1g + 4B1g + B2g + 5Eg [37]. These modes can be further classified\ninto internal (\u03bd1-\u03bd4) and external (translational, T, and rotational, R) modes of VO4 units as\nfollows,\n\n10\n\n\f\u0413 = A1g (\u03bd1, \u03bd2) + B1g (2T, \u03bd3, \u03bd4) + B2g (\u03bd2) + Eg (2T, R, \u03bd3, \u03bd4).\n\n(1)\n\nFigure 7(a) shows the Raman spectra of CeVO4 in the zircon phase at different\npressures up to 4.5 GPa. Eight Raman modes have been observed at ambient condition out of\n12 Raman peaks predicted for CeVO4 in the zircon phase. The symmetry assignment for the\nRaman modes has been performed in accordance with our calculations and the comparison\nwith previous results in other vanadates and it is summarized in Table VI.\nAs can be seen from Figure 7(a) and Table VI, the intense symmetric-stretching\ninternal mode \u03bd1(A1g), observed at 864 cm-1 near ambient pressure, exhibits the lowest\nfrequency for this mode when compared to other rare-earth orthovanadates [38]. This result\nsuggests that CeVO4 exhibits the weakest intra-tetrahedral V-O bonds of all orthovanadates.\nThe two asymmetric-stretching modes \u03bd3(Eg) and \u03bd3(B1g) have been observed at 801 and 789\ncm-1, respectively. Apart from these phonons of CeVO4, the 4 bending modes of the VO4 unit\ncould be observed in the frequency range from 260 to 500 cm-1. However, we have observed\nonly 3 bending modes [\u03bd2(B2g), \u03bd2(A1g), and \u03bd4(B1g)] whose frequencies at ambient pressures\nare 262, 381, and 469 cm-1, respectively. The asymmetric-bending mode \u03bd4(Eg) could not be\ndetected. In most of the orthovanadates this mode remains undetectable [39 - 43]. Similarly,\nout of the five external modes two T(Eg) modes and one T(B1g) mode have not been detected.\nThese modes are absent probably due to their weak Raman scattering cross-sections.\nFigure 7(b) shows the pressure dependence of Raman modes of CeVO4 in the zircon\nphase. The symmetry assignment for the Raman modes along with their experimental and\ncalculated frequencies, pressure coefficients, and mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters (\u03b3) are shown\nin Table VI. A very good agreement is found between experimental and theoretical results.\nThe frequencies of almost all Raman-active modes of the zircon phase exhibit a positive\npressure coefficient. The rotational mode has the highest Gr\u00fcneisen parameter, being the\nmode most sensitive to changes of volume. In addition, the internal bending mode of \u03bd2(B2g)\n\n11\n\n\fsymmetry shows a negative pressure coefficient. A similar soft behavior was observed for the\n\u03bd2(B2g) mode in other orthovanadates, e.g. YVO4 [39], YbVO4 [41], LuVO4 [42], ScVO4 [40]\nand also in ScPO4 [10]. Our calculations also predict the softening of the T(Eg) mode with\nlowest frequency in CeVO4. This softening has been also observed in other orthovanadates\nand it could be a characteristic behavior of zircon-type compounds [39 - 42]. It is important\nto note that the softening of both T(Eg) and \u03bd2(B2g) modes has been observed in compounds\nexhibiting the zircon-to-scheelite transition [39 - 44] and also in those showing the zircon-tomonazite transition [7, 10]. Therefore, it indicates that the softening of both modes is a\nconsequence of the instability of the zircon phase. We will discuss this issue in great detail in\nour discussion section.\nAs regards the values of the pressure coefficients of the Raman-active modes of the\nzircon-type orthovanadates, it is worth to mention that the pressure coefficients of the internal\nstretching modes in CeVO4 is of the order of 4.9 to 5.5 cm-1/GPa, which is in close\ncomparison with other orthovanadates [39 - 44]. Similarly, the pressure coefficients of the\n\u03bd2(B2g) bending mode is of the order of -1.2 as among orthovanadates. Finally, it is\ninteresting to note that the pressure coefficient of the rotational R(Eg) mode of CeVO4 has the\nsmallest pressure coefficient of all known orthovanadates; thus indicating weak Ce - VO4\nbonds as compared to other orthovanadates [39 - 44].\n(ii)\n\nMonazite structured CeVO4\nRaman scattering measurements in CeVO4 evidence that this compound undergoes a\n\nzircon-to-monazite phase transition above 5 GPa. Group theoretical calculations for CeVO4\nin monazite phase (SG: P21/n, point group\n\n) predict 36 vibrational Raman modes at the\n\nBZ centre with following symmetries \u0413 = 18Ag + 18 Bg [45]. These modes can be further\nclassified into internal (\u03bd1-\u03bd4) and external (translational, T, and rotational, R) modes of VO4\nunits as follows,\n\n12\n\n\f\u0413 = Ag (6T, 3R, \u03bd1, 2\u03bd2, 3\u03bd3, 3\u03bd4) + Bg (6T, 3R, \u03bd1, 2\u03bd2, 3\u03bd3, 3\u03bd4)\n\n(2)\n\nRaman spectra of CeVO4 in the monazite phase at selected pressures are shown in\nFigure 8(a). At 5.3 GPa we have observed the appearance of several Raman bands, both in\nthe range between 0 and 500 cm-1 and between 700 and 1000 cm-1, accompanied by the\nbroadening of many Raman modes. These changes in the Raman spectra are indicative of a\nstructural phase transition towards the lower-symmetry monoclinic monazite phase. This\nresult is consistent with our XRD investigations and with previous results in orthophosphates\n[7, 10]. Out of 36 Raman-active modes in the monazite phase, we observed only 27 modes\nwith measurable intensity up to 12 GPa. The absence of nine Raman modes could be due to\nvery small Raman scattering cross section and also possibly due to overlapping of many Ag\nand Bg modes due to their small splitting. Similarly, in Raman scattering measurements of\nseveral monazite-type orthophosphates 22 Raman modes were recorded out of 36 Raman\nactive modes [46]. Above 12 GPa only the Raman-active modes of the high frequency region\nabove 700 cm-1 were noticeable and on further increase of pressure at 15.9 GPa all the Raman\nmodes are completely diminished. This could have happened due to extremely weak Raman\nsignal at this pressure or possibly due to a second phase transition to a Raman non-active\nphase or because of pressure-induced amorphization. Future studies will be done to clarify\nthis point which is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe mode assignment of the experimentally-observed Raman modes in CeVO4 in the\nmonazite phase was done by comparing the experimental and calculated values of\nfrequencies and pressure coefficients and is shown in Table VII together with mode\nGr\u00fcneisen parameters (\u03b3), calculated using the bulk modulus of the monazite phase, B0 =\n131.5 GPa, obtained from XRD measurements. The assignment of modes can be done\nbroadly in two regions. The internal modes of vibration of VO4 tetrahedra covered the\nfrequency range of 290-950 cm-1 while the external modes of VO4 unit span the frequency\n\n13\n\n\frange of 50-270 cm-1. This assignment is consistent in comparison with orthophosphates [46].\nIn general, the calculated Raman frequencies and their pressure coefficients are in good\nagreement with our experimental ones. The only mode whose assignment is doubtful is the\nsoft mode observed at 89.6 cm-1 at ambient pressure. This mode shows a frequency close to\nthat of the calculated Ag mode at 92.5 cm-1 but its negative pressure coefficient is more\nsimilar to that of the calculated Bg mode at 95.3 cm-1.\nFigure 8(b) shows the pressure dependence of the Raman-active modes of CeVO4 in\nthe monazite phase. All the experimental Raman-active modes show a positive pressure\ncoefficient except the two Raman modes at 89.6 cm-1 and 140.4 cm-1 which is in good\nagreement with our calculations that predict three soft modes. The pressure-evolution\nobserved for the Raman modes is similar to that reported for monazite CePO4 [32]. Only the\nsoft mode of Bg symmetry calculated at 66.2 cm-1 at ambient pressure was not measured. The\nsoftening of the same Raman modes was previously observed in TbVO4 [8]. On release of\npressure from 15.9 GPa to ambient pressure the monazite phase was recovered, thus showing\nthe irreversible nature of the zircon-to-monazite phase transition in good agreement with our\nXRD results. It must be noted that a similar behavior was observed for TbPO4 [7].\n(iii) Scheelite structured CeVO4\nGroup theoretical calculations for CeVO4 in the scheelite phase (SG: I41/a, point\ngroup\n\n) predict 13 vibrational Raman modes at the BZ centre with following symmetries\n\n\u0413 = 3Ag + 5Bg + 5Eg [47]. As already commented, our theoretical calculations predict the\npossibility of the scheelite phase for CeVO4 which has been observed in Bridgman-cell\nexperiments. Table VIII shows the comparison of theoretically calculated and experimental\nRaman modes of CeVO4 in the scheelite phase along with pressure coefficients and with\nmode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters (\u03b3), to evaluate the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters (\u03b3) the calculated\nbulk modulus B0 = 138.65 GPa is used. The calculated Raman frequencies match quite well\n\n14\n\n\fwith the experimental ones at ambient conditions. The pressure coefficients are similar to that\nobserved in the scheelite phase in other vanadates [39 \u2013 43]. In Table VIII, it can be seen\nthat the strongest mode of scheelite, the symmetric stretching Ag mode, is observed at 826.7\ncm-1, which is consistent with other scheelite orthovanadates [39, 40]. This implies a collapse\nof the frequency of the strongest mode in comparison with the zircon structure, a typical\nfeature of the zircon-scheelite transition. Finally, the frequencies of other Raman modes are\nalso in quite agreement with other scheelite orthovanadates [39, 40].\nV.\n\nDiscussion\nZircon-structured orthovanadates under hydrostatic compression were observed to\n\nundergo the zircon-to-scheelite and then the scheelite-to-fergusonite phase transitions [39 42]. In all cases, the scheelite phase was found to be quenchable on release of pressure. The\nzircon-to-scheelite phase transition is a rather sluggish first-order and reconstructive\ntransition in nature [48] while the scheelite-to-fergusonite is a ferroelastic second-order and\ndisplacive transition [49]. In our case, the zircon to scheelite transition involves a volume\ncollapse of 11%, which is consistent with the first-order character of the transformation. On\nthe other hand, the zircon-to-monazite phase transition is a rather sudden transition with a\nvolume collapse of 8%, with an increase of the Ce3+ coordination, and without coexistence of\nphases over a wide pressure range (typical of the zircon-scheelite transition). All these facts\nindicate the first-order and reconstructive nature of this phase transition. The structural\nrelationships between monazite and zircon were elucidated by Ni et al. [5]. These\nrelationships can be used to understand the reconstructive nature of the zircon-to-monazite\nphase transition with the help of Fig. 1. In monazite, CeO9 polyhedra share edges and corners\nwith isolated VO4 tetrahedra whereas CeO8 dodecahedra in zircon. The edge sharing VO4 and\nCeO8 polyhedral chains along the [001] direction of the zircon structure appears to be like\npolyhedral chains in monazite, although the chains are twisted to accommodate the ninth\n\n15\n\n\fatom. However, due to the extra ninth oxygen atom packing efficiency in monazite phase is\nbetter compared to zircon phase. This result supports the observed higher bulk modulus value\nfor monazite CeVO4. This new atomic arrangement in the monazite phase can be realized by\nconsidering a slight shift of the [001] planes and a rotation of VO4 polyhedra in the a-b plane.\nThe fact that this transition (as well as the zircon-scheelite transition) is not reversible is a\nnotable aspect. We think that a large kinetic barrier is the cause of non reversibility, which is\nconsistent with the reconstructive mechanism of this transition and its first-order character.\nAnother important issue to remark is that the presence of the AO9 polyhedra (a cationic\npentagonal interpenetrating tetrahedral polyhedral) allows monazite to accommodate\nchemically diverse cations. The irregular coordination around the A cation does not place\nsevere symmetry, size, or charge constrains and allows large domains of chemical\ncomposition. Therefore, we predict that in addition to CeVO4, other zircon-structured\nvanadates with large A cations could also take the monazite structure under pressure,\nbecoming isostructural to LaCrO4.\nAn important issue related with the fact that under compression the zircon structure\nbecomes mechanically unstable is the softening of external translational T(Eg) and internal\n\u03bd2(B2g) bending modes. In zircon structured compounds, the softening of the T(Eg) mode is\nrelated with a softening of the C44 elastic constant. This fact is caused by monoclinic\ndistortions in the a-c or b-c planes [50]. Similarly, the softening of \u03bd2(B2g) mode is related to\na softening of the C66 elastic constant, which is caused by orthorhombic distortions in the\nbasal plane [50]. Low-temperature studies of zircon-structured DyVO4, DyAsO4 and TbVO4\nindicate a similar phonon softening which can be attributed to the distortion of the zircon\nstructure along [110] or [100] direction [51, 52]. By analogy, the pressure-induced\ncontraction would lead to similar distortions in the zircon structure making this structure\nunstable.\n\n16\n\n\fIn order to contribute to the systematic understanding of structural properties of\nzircon-type oxides, here we will make the attempt to understand the factors which govern the\nphase stability at ambient pressure and the sequence of pressure-induced structural phase\ntransitions in orthovanadates and orthophosphates. As commented earlier, the phase stability\nof zircon-type orthovanadates and orthophosphates and their phase transitions seem to greatly\ndepend upon the ionic radii. This is consistent with the recent updated version of Bastide's\ndiagram for ABX4 compounds elaborated and discussed by D. Errandonea and F.J. Manj\u00f3n\n[53]. In Bastide \u0301s diagram, the phase stability and phase transitions of ABO4 orthovanadates\nand orthophosphates can be understood by considering the role played by cationic radii, rA\nand rB, with respect to anion radius, rO [54]. In this diagram, those compounds which have\nrA/rO and rB/rO cation-to-anion ratios well inside the stability region of the zircon structure are\nobserved to undergo the zircon-to-scheelite phase transition and follow the traditional northeast (NE) rule in the Bastide's diagram [54]. Such is the case of many zircon-structured\northovanadates, like YVO4 [39], ScVO4 [40], YbVO4 [41], LuVO4 [42], and also in ScPO4\n[10]. On the other hand, those compounds whose rA/rO and rB/rO cation-to-anion ratios fall\nnear border of the stability region of the zircon and monazite structures could crystallize in\nboth phases, like CeVO4, TbPO4 [7, 8], and YPO4 [9]. In this case, the compounds\ncrystallizing in the zircon phase, like CeVO4, are prone to undergo the zircon-to-monazite\nphase transition. Few orthophosphates, like YbPO4 and LuPO4 [11], are exception to this rule\nand deserve further investigation. Finally, the last case would correspond to compounds\nwhose rA/rO and rB/rO cation-to-anion ratios fall well inside the stability region of the\nmonazite phase. This is the case for most orthophosphates which already crystallize in the\nmonazite phase. To conclude we would like to add that the crystal chemistry arguments here\nused to discuss the structural behavior of phosphates and vanadates has been recently\nsatisfactory use to describe arsenates and chromates [55].\n\n17\n\n\fFinally, we would like to comment on additional consequences of the observed\npressure-driven structural changes. CeVO4 is a large band-gap material with a band-gap\nenergy of 3.1-4.2 [56, 57]. It is usually assumed that the electronic structure near the Fermi\nlevel is dominated by V 3d and O 2p states. However, recently a band-gap of 1.8 eV was\nmeasured [58] being attributed to the presence of localized 4f levels of Ce between the\nvalence and conduction bands. Clearly there is a contradiction between both pictures of the\nelectronic band structure which could be solved by HP optical-absorption studies like those\nalready preformed in PbWO4 [59]. It is known that pressure affects differently localized and\ndelocalized electronic states. In particular, if 4f states are present near the Fermi level, we\nexpect Eg to be considerable reduced by pressure within the stability range of the zircon\nstructure. In addition, both the zircon-scheelite and zircon-monazite transition will probably\ncause a large collapse of the band-gap as a consequence of the atomic rearrangement after the\nphase transitions. Finally, another issue interesting to explore in the future are the effects\ncaused by HP f electron delocalization of lanthanides [60], which, among other things, should\nmodify the magnetic properties of compounds like CeVO4.\nVI. Conclusion\nX-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, and theoretical studies of CeVO4 up to 16 GPa\nsuggests that the low-pressure zircon phase undergo an irreversible zircon-to-monazite phase\ntransition at 5.3 GPa. XRD and Raman signals weaken considerably beyond 12 and 16 GPa,\nrespectively, evading any further measurements. The symmetries of the Raman modes in the\nzircon and monazite phases of CeVO4 have been assigned in accordance with our lattice\ndynamics calculations. In general, good agreement is found for the zircon to monazite phase\ntransition by our experimental and theoretical data. Our calculations predict the monazite to\nscheelite phase transition which could not be detected experimentally under hydrostatic\nconditions. However, the scheelite structure is observed upon compression under non-\n\n18\n\n\fhydrostatic conditions. The softening of external translational T(Eg) and internal \u03bd2(B2g)\nbending modes can be attributed to distortion in the zircon structure along [110] or [100]\ndirection associated with the phase transition. We have also discussed the dependence of the\nphase stability of the zircon phase and its pressure-induced phase transitions either to the\nscheelite or monazite phases in orthovanadates and orthophosphates on their rA/rO and rB/rO\ncation-to-anion ratios. Finally, the effects of non hydrostaticity in the structural sequence are\ndiscussed. We found that different compression methods induced a transition to different\nstructures.\nAcknowledgments\nResearch financed by the Spanish MCINN under Grants No. MAT2010-21270-C0401/02/04, CSD2007-00045, and No. CTQ2009-14596-C02-01.
