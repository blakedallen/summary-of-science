Introduction\nIt has been shown that for zero curvature, the global topology of comoving space can affect the dynamics expected\nin the weak-field Newtonian limit (Roukema et al. 2007),\nin contrast to what was previously thought. In particular,\na test particle of negligible mass near a massive particle\n(such as a cluster of galaxies dominated by its dark matter\nhalo) has unequal attractions to the nearest topological images of the massive particle in opposite directions, since its\nposition is asymmetrically offset from the massive particle.\nThis leaves a residual acceleration effect that is qualititatively similar to that of dark energy. For realistic physical\nscales at the present epoch, the effect was estimated to be\nabout 10\u22129 times weaker than the observed cosmological\nconstant.\nThe heuristic calculations presented in Roukema et al.\n(2007) only considered the flat spaces T \u00d7 R2 and T 3 .\nHowever, there has been interest in the Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral space, S 3 /I \u2217 , being a candidate model for\ncomoving space that explains the \"missing fluctuations\nproblem\" tentatively observed in the COsmic Microwave\nBackground (COBE) all-sky maps and confirmed in the\nWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) all-sky\n\nmaps (Spergel et al. 2003; Luminet et al. 2003; Roukema\net al. 2004; Aurich et al. 2005a, 2005b; Gundermann 2005;\nKey et al. 2007; Niarchou & Jaffe 2007; Caillerie et al. 2007;\nLew & Roukema 2008; Roukema et al. 2008a, 2008b). Does\na similar residual gravity effect occur in the case of positively curved space, in particular, in the Poincar\u00e9 space?\nAn additional question of interest is whether or not the\nresidual gravity effect might distinguish the Poincar\u00e9 space\nfrom other well-proportioned spaces (Weeks et al. 2004).\nThe Poincar\u00e9 space is presently preferred to the octahedral space (S 3 /T \u2217 ) and the truncated cube space (S 3 /O\u2217 )\nbecause of empirical constraints on curvature. For a to>\n>\u03a9\ntal density of 1.02 \u223c\ntot \u223c 1.01, the latter two spaces have\nlarger fundamental domains than the Poincar\u00e9 space and so\nhave difficulty explaining the missing fluctuations problem.\nHowever, this is an empirical argument with no theoretical\nmotivation. Could there be any dynamical arguments either\nfavouring or disfavouring the Poincar\u00e9 space? Some steps\nhave been taken towards what might develop into a quantum cosmology theory of cosmic topology, using various\nnotions of distance between different manifolds (Masafumi\n1996; Anderson et al. 2004) and analysis of topology change\nin quantum gravity (e.g., Dowker & Surya 1998). The resid-\n\n\f2\n\nRoukema & R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski: Residual gravity in the Poincar\u00e9 space\n\nual gravity effect might contribute an additional criterion\nfor comparing different manifolds.\nHere, the residual gravity effect in the octahedral space,\nthe truncated cube space, and the Poincar\u00e9 space is studied\nby considering the dynamics of a negligible-mass test particle near a massive particle. As in Roukema et al. (2007),\nthis approach can be considered as an heuristic model for\na positively curved space that is homogeneous except for\na small neighbourhood around one point, in which a positive density fluctuation of matter has collapsed into a highdensity, nearly point-like object, in excess of the underlying\nhomogeneous density distribution. To satisfy Stokes' theorem, the weak-limit gravitational attraction in the three\nspherical spaces is set to be proportional to\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u22122\nr\nRC sin\n(1)\nRC\nrather than r\u22122 (see Sect. 2.1), where RC is the curvature radius. Numerical calculations are made in the universal covering space S 3 embedded in R4 for convenience.\nAccelerations are calculated in the tangent 3-space at the\nposition of the test particle, represented as 4-vectors in R4 .\nThe T 3 model discussed in Roukema et al. (2007) is revisited, using the covering space R3 .\nThe method is described in more detail in Sect. 2.\nResidual accelerations estimated to the third order in the\nTaylor expansion of the fractional displacement are presented for the 3-torus in Sect. 3.1. Residual accelerations\nto fifth order for individual pairs of opposite images in\nthe spherical spaces are presented analytically in Sect. 3.2.\nResidual accelerations to fifth order for the full set of adjacent1 images in the spherical spaces are presented numerically in Sect. 3.3. For the Poincar\u00e9 space, an analytical\nderivation of the residual acceleration to fifth order is also\ngiven in Sect. 3.3.1. A statistical summary is presented in\nSect. 3.3.2.\nDiscussion and conclusions are given in Sects. 4 and\n5 respectively. Discussion of spherical, multiply connected\nspaces is available in Weeks (2001), Gausmann et al. (2001),\nLehoucq et al. (2002), and Riazuelo et al. (2004), and we\nrefer the reader to references therein for introductions to\ncosmic topology. Distances are calculated in a spatial section at constant cosmological time in the universal covering\nspace (S 3 for the spherical spaces, R3 for T 3 ), by default\nas \"physical\" distances, i.e., r = a\u03c7, where a(t) is the scale\nfactor and \u03c7 is a comoving distance (i.e. \u03c7 is a \"proper\ndistance\" at the present epoch, (Weinberg 1972), equivalent to \"conformal time\" if c = 1). Distance units are normally presented here in h\u22121 Mpc or h\u22121 Gpc, where the\nHubble constant is written H0 \u2261 100h km s\u22121 /Mpc. The\nfundamental domains of all the spaces are assumed to be\nperfectly regular. The Newtonian gravitational constant is\nwritten as G.\n\n2. Method\nAlthough dynamics in the Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral space\nS 3 /I \u2217 could, in principle, be studied by applying boundary\nconditions that identify opposite faces of a dodecahedral\n1\n\n\"Adjacent\" is used here to refer to images in copies of the\nfundamental domain that share a face with the \"original\" copy\nof the fundamental domain.\n\nfundamental domain of a positive curvature radius RC with\none another, this would probably be extremely complicated\nfor both analytical and numerical calculations. It is simpler\nto work in the universal covering space S 3 represented as a\nsubspace of R4 .\nAs described in Sect. 2.1 of Roukema et al. (2007), several assumptions are required for this heuristic approach.\nHere, the corresponding assumptions are as follows:\n(1) the flat Newtonian approximation of gravity is replaced\nby the equivalent in positively curved space, as described in Eq. (1) above;\n(2), (3) the covering space is S 3 , which is not flat;\n(4) a finite particle horizon Rhor that is just large enough\nto include all adjacent topological images is assumed;\n(5), (6) identical to those in Roukema et al. (2007): the\nmetric is assumed to be that for a perfectly homogeneous model of the same curvature, except that the distant, multiple copies of the local massive particle are\nconsidered to provide a contribution to the local gravitational potential that may not fully cancel;\n(7), (8) are not needed here since the one-body problem in\nS 3 (Sect. 3.1.1, Roukema et al.) is divergent and only\nbriefly mentioned in Sect. 2.1.\n2.1. Weak-limit gravity and divergences\nAs stated in Eq.(1), to satisfy Stokes' theorem, the weaklimit gravitational attraction towards a single massive particle is set to be proportional to [RC sin(r/RC )]\u22122 rather\nthan r\u22122 . This can be understood as follows.\nLet S 3 be represented by a spherical coordinate system\ncentred on the massive particle, so that the FriedmannLema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) line element is written\nds2 = \u2212c2 dt2 + dr2 + [RC sin(r/RC )]2 (d\u03b82 + cos2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\n(2)\nwhere the scale factor a(t) is subsumed into r and RC ,\nsince it is not needed explicitly. We can write the weaklimit gravitational acceleration towards the massive particle\nas the vector field\nf (r) r\u0302\n\n(3)\n\nby symmetry, where r\u0302 is the unit radial vector in the tangent space at a radial \"physical\" distance r from the origin\nalong a spatial geodesic, and\nlim\n\nr\u21920+\n\n\u2212f (r) r2\n=1\nGm\n\n(4)\n\nin order to agree with the flat-space Newtonian limit towards the massive particle of mass m.

More generally, an infinite repulsive (attractive)\nforce exists for gravitational signals that have travelled odd\n(even) values of j times the half-circumference \u03c0RC from\nthe massive object, i.e. j/2 times around the whole space,\nwhere j \u2208 Z.\nSecondly, even if we ignore the model of a zero-size point\nparticle as an idealised fiction, a problem remains for a\nnegligible-mass test particle near a massive particle. The\ntest particle also experiences accelerations from signals that\nhave travelled j times around S 3 in the two different directions along the great circle passing through the test particle\nand the massive particle, where j \u2208 Z.

The latter divergence, i.e. that in Eq. (8), is removed\nby assumption (4) above. Assumption (4) also removes the\nj\u03c0RC divergence. A finite particle horizon Rhor just large\nenough to include the adjacent topological images is necessary for a residual gravity effect to occur, but it does not\nneed to be as large as \u03c0RC . The adjacent topological images in S 3 /T \u2217, S 3 /O\u2217 , and S 3 /I \u2217 are at (\u03c0/3)RC , (\u03c0/4)RC\n\n3\n\nand (\u03c0/3)RC , and (\u03c0/5)RC respectively.

Numerical precision\n\n3. Results\n3.1. T 3 revisited\nIn Sect. 3.2 of Roukema et al. (2007), an analytical estimate of the acceleration from all six adjacent images in a\nT 3 model was shown to be zero to first order when the\nthree fundamental lengths of the model are exactly equal.\nHowever, the lower scatterings of points in Figs. 7 and 8 of\nthat paper do not represent numerical error. Recalculation\nof Eqs (11) to (15) of Roukema et al. (2007) to higher\norder shows that for perfectly equal fundamental lengths\nLa = Le = Lu , higher order terms in Eq. (15) do not all\ncancel. The lowest order non-cancelling terms are the third\norder terms\n(r\u0308topo )(i,j,k)\u2208{(\u00b11,0,0),(0,\u00b11,0),(0,0,\u00b11)}\n7Gm 3\n=\n[2\u01ebx \u2212 3\u01ebx (\u01eb2y + \u01eb2z ), 2\u01eb3y \u2212 3\u01eby (\u01eb2x + \u01eb2z ),\nL2a\n2\u01eb3z \u2212 3\u01ebz (\u01eb2x + \u01eb2y )],\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the massive particle is at the origin (0, 0, 0) in the\ncovering space R3 and the test particle is slightly displaced\nat (x = \u01ebx La , y = \u01eby La , z = \u01ebz La ). For test particles distributed isotropically around the massive particle, numerical integration of these third order terms gives the distri3\nThe IEEE 754-2008 standard recommends the term \"significand\" rather than \"mantissa\".\n\n100\n\na3 (T3)\n\nFor the full set of adjacent topological images in the spherical spaces, Eq. (9) is evaluated primarily by a numerical\napproach, using double precision floating-point operations\nwhere sufficient, and arbitrary precision floating-point operations where necessary. Typical scales of interest, i.e., for\ntypical test particles in a void of large-scale structure, are a\nfew tens of megaparsecs. This gives 10\u22124 < r/RC < 10\u22122 as\na useful domain for finding the highest terms in the Taylor\nexpansion of the residual gravity for r \u226a RC , where RC =\n25h\u22121 Gpc as stated above. By setting RC = G = m = 1\ninternally in numerical calculations, nearly equal and opposite accelerations from nearly opposed topological images are each of approximately unity order, the fourth and\nfifth order terms at the lower limit r/RC = 10\u22124 should\ntherefore be above the numerical noise limit, if the calculating precision is well below \u223c 10\u221216 and 10\u221220 , respectively. These would require precision in the significand3 well\nabove log2 1016 \u2248 53 and log2 1020 \u2248 66 bits respectively.\nAccording to the IEEE 754-1985 standard, double-precision\nfloating-point numbers have 53-bit precision in the significand (including one implicit bit). This would at best provide just one bit of information for a fourth order term and\nno information for a fifth order term for r/RC = 10\u22124 . For\nthis reason, an arbitrary precision library is used here to\nexamine higher order terms.\nAnalytical calculations are also made for the Poincar\u00e9\nspace. We also revisit the T 3 calculation made in Sect. 3.2\nof Roukema et al. (2007), in order to consider higher order terms. The first order term was found to cancel for a\nperfectly regular T 3 model.\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22126\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22123\nr/L\n\n10\u22122\n\nFig. 1.

This expression is consistent with the lower\nscatterings of points in Figs. 7 and 8 of Roukema et al.\n(2007). Here, Fig. 1 shows a similar numerical calculation,\nusing the radial component of the sum of 1/r2 accelerations for the eight adjacent images, calculated directly from\nEq. (10) of Roukema et al. (2007) without using the Taylor\nexpansion.

The residual acceleration is anisotropic, depending on the relation between the\ntest particle's displacement from the massive particle and\nthe orientation of the fundamental directions. The positive\nskewness implies that even though the mean radial acceleration is close to zero, the mode and median are negative,\ni.e., test particles placed in random directions relative to\nthe massive particle are more likely to be subject to a radial\ndeceleration rather than a radial acceleration. The amplitude of the effect is third order, i.e., about (r/La )2 times\nsmaller than the residual effect that occurs for slightly unequal fundamental lengths. If an upper estimate for r/La\nat the present epoch is used, then this is a factor of about\na million.\n\n\fRoukema & R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski: Residual gravity in the Poincar\u00e9 space\n\n3.2.

However, the spherical manifolds are not vector\nspaces, so a similar interpretation of the single-pair calculation is not possible.\nOn the other hand, Eqs (15), (17), and (18) hint at the\nform that numerical estimates for the sum of the weak-limit\nresidual gravitational effect from all the adjacent images\n\u2217\nmay take for a given spherical manifold.

The effect\nof reducing the precision to 50 or 60 bits is clear in Fig. 5,\ni.e., for the orthogonal component of the residual acceleration in the Poincar\u00e9 space. Noise created by the precision\nlimit enters the calculation, for example, when converting\nfrom a double-precision position in R4 of the test particle\nto a multi-precision position. Apart from special cases, the\nfinite precision representation of a typical, pseudo-random\nparticle position in R4 will place the particle at a position\nslightly offset from the physical 3-surface S 3 , because of the\nlimited precision. If the particle is not located exactly on\nS 3 , then this induces an acceleration that is orthogonal to\nthe tangent 3-plane at r.

Firstly, a\nsmall numerical value r/RC = 10\u22123 is chosen in order to\nevaluate the unit tangent vector at r pointing towards the\nmassive particle. The sign of the latter is reversed in order\nto point away from the massive particle. Secondly, pseudorandom numerical values for x, y, z are substituted into the\nfull vector residual acceleration [Eq. (21) or (22)] and the\nscalar product with the unit tangent vector is taken in order\nto obtain the radial component of the residual acceleration.\nThis is subtracted from the full residual to obtain the orthogonal component.\n3.3.2. Statistical description\nFor an isotropic distribution of the directions of displacement of the test particle, Table 1 lists characteristic statistics of the radial and orthogonal components of the residual\nacceleration for the four well-proportioned spaces, primarily calculated from direct numerical estimates using Eq. (9).\nBy construction, the orthogonal component is necessarily\nnon-negative. Since estimation of the parameters of the\nPoincar\u00e9 space residual acceleration is sensitive to numerical precision limits, Table 1 also lists parameters for the\nPoincar\u00e9 space radial component estimated using Eq. (21)\nand the unit tangent vector described above. Within the\nuncertainties indicated by the standard error in the mean\n\u03c3hai i , the two estimates agree.\n\n\f8\n\nRoukema & R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski: Residual gravity in the Poincar\u00e9 space\n\n4. Discussion\nThe results shown above are quite sensitive to small errors\nin the positions of the adjacent topological images. This\nprovides a useful check of the calculations, since a small\narbitrary error is most likely to yield a stronger residual\nacceleration than a weaker one. Increasing or decreasing\nthe distances from the massive particle to the two members of one of the opposite pairs of topological images by\n0.1% is sufficient to destabilise the nearly perfect equilibrium defined by the full set of adjacent topological images\nfor a given space. The residual acceleration reverts to being\ndominated by (r/RC )1 rather than (r/RC )3 or (r/RC )5 .\nThis sensitivity to small changes in the distances to\ntopological images is physically interesting. As found in\nSect. 3 of Roukema et al. (2007), the residual acceleration in\na T 3 model of slightly unequal fundamental lengths is dominated by a linear term in r/La , which tends to equalise the\nthree fundamental lengths. The same relation applies for\nthe spherical models. These are very well balanced in the\nsense that the linear term cancels, and in the case of the\nPoincar\u00e9 space, the cubic term cancels too, provided that\nthese spaces are perfectly homogeneous. A small decrease\nin the injectivity diameter in one direction implies stronger\nacceleration for a test particle, favouring a return towards\nperfect isotropy in the fundamental lengths. Conversely, a\nsmall increase in the injectivity diameter implies weaker acceleration, again favouring a return towards isotropy. The\nresidual acceleration tends to encourage the space to return\nto perfect \"residual acceleration equilibrium\", in which the\nresidual acceleration disappears down to the third or fifth\norder.\nClearly, these effects are negligible in the present epoch\nat the level of observational detectability for the next few\ndecades. Moreover, given the present empirical interest in\nthe Poincar\u00e9 space, the prediction of the perfectly isotropic\nmodel would be an absence of a residual acceleration effect\nto a much higher observational accuracy than that for the\neffects predicted by the other three well-proportioned models, which in turn would be more difficult to detect than the\nresidual acceleration effect from ill-proportioned models.\nHowever, the Universe is certainly inhomogeneous. If\nevidence continues to accumulate for the Poincar\u00e9 space\nmodel with successively more accurate estimates of the\nmodel's astronomical coordinates, following the estimates\nmade in Roukema et al. (2008a, 2008b), then several observational approaches could be used to test the predictions of the residual acceleration effect. With a sufficient\nlevel of precision, matched circles and/or annuli on the sky\nshould yield slightly different fundamental lengths along\nthe six axes. The residual acceleration effect should consist\nof a positive or negative extra acceleration for shorter or\nlonger fundamental lengths, respectively. Surveys of tracers\nof large-scale structure lying along the different geodesics\nto topological images of, for example, the Virgo cluster,\ncould also be used to estimate which directions should have\nslightly longer than average geodesics and which should\nhave slightly shorter than average geodesics. All three estimates should agree with one another, provided that no\nother sources of random and systematic error interfere.\nHence, the residual acceleration effect potentially offers a\nphysical mechanism for testing a multiply-connected model\nof comoving space, as an alternative to relying on geometri-\n\nTable 2.

Does the\nPoincar\u00e9 space occupy a dynamically more stable state\nthan the other well-proportioned spaces, which in turn are\nmore stable than ill-proportioned spaces? This would most\nlikely require significant inhomogeneities in the very early\nUniverse, which themselves might have been subsequently\nremoved by the residual gravity acceleration effect itself.\nApart from the possible physical consequences of this\nresult, it may be interesting to ask if these results are reasonable from an intuitive mathematical point of view. It is\nuseful to consider this in terms of pairs of opposite images,\nsince if the test particle lies along the geodesic joining the\nlocal copy and the two opposite distant copies of the massive particle, then the single pair yields a linear-dominated\nresidual acceleration. In order for the linear (or higher order) terms in the residual acceleration to cancel, the acceleration components that are approximately orthogonal to\nthe geodesic joining the test particle to the two members of\na given opposite pair need to be able to cancel the approximately radial components of residual accelerations in other\npairs of images. In the T 3 case, three nearly orthogonal\npairs are sufficient for the linear terms to completely cancel\nin this way (provided that the fundamental domain is perfectly regular). Given that S 3 /T \u2217 , S 3 /O\u2217 , and S 3 /I \u2217 have\nfour, seven, and six opposite pairs, respectively, it is reasonable to imagine that the radial components of the linear\nresidual-acceleration term of a given pair are cancelled by\nthe orthogonal components of the other pairs, since there\nare many of them, distributed symmetrically.\nIt is also possible to imagine that with a high enough\nnumber of opposite pairs and sufficient symmetry, a higher\norder term such as the third order might also disappear,\nby means of fine balancing between the different directions.\nThe truncated cube space S 3 /O\u2217 and the Poincar\u00e9 space\nS 3 /I \u2217 have the highest numbers of opposite pairs, or equivalently, the highest numbers of pairs of faces of their fundamental domains. However, the truncated cube cannot be\na regular polyhedron; its faces are six truncated squares\nand eight triangles. All the faces of the fundamental domain of the Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral space have the same\nshape: a pentagon. In this sense, it is more symmetrical\nthan the truncated cube space. So requiring both a fundamental domain with a high number of faces and a high\n\n\fRoukema & R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski: Residual gravity in the Poincar\u00e9 space\n\nlevel of symmetry would seem to provide a qualitative pair\nof conditions to explain why the Poincar\u00e9 space is more\nfinely balanced than the other well-proportioned spaces.\nHowever, could either the subset of topological images\ncorresponding to only the octagonal faces of the fundamental domain of the truncated cube, or the subset corresponding to only the triangular faces, nevertheless cancel to fifth\norder, and become hidden because the other subset reintroduces a third order term? A calculation similar to those\ndeveloped above shows that both subsets separately retain\nthe third order as the dominant order. Table 2 gives statistical characteristics of the third order coefficients for the\ntwo subsets. So the Poincar\u00e9 space retains its uniqueness in\ncancelling down to fifth order.\nAn aspect of the residual acceleration as expressed in\nEqs (21) and (22) that may initially seem counterintuitive\nis the permutational symmetry between the x, y, and z components, since a dodecahedron is not always thought of as\nhaving cubical symmetry. However, an appropriate orientation of the dodecahedron in R3 , such as that used in our\ncomputer algebra script, shows an (x, y, z) symmetry. The\ntwelve adjacent topological images consist of three\n\u221a quadru3\nplets\northogonally\nprojected\nto\nR\n,\n[0,\n\u00b11/2,\n\u00b1(\n5 \u2212 1)/4],\n\u221a\n\u221a\n[\u00b1( 5 \u2212 1)/4, 0, \u00b11/2], and [\u00b11/2, \u00b1( 5 \u2212 1)/4, 0]. Each of\nthese quadruplets lies in a 2-plane in R3 , i.e., x = 0, y = 0,\nand z = 0, respectively. In this orientation, the \"top\" and\n\"bottom\" of the dodecahedron are edges, not faces. These\ntwo edges, along with four others, can be used to inscribe\nthe dodecahedron in a cube (in flat space).\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn Roukema et al. (2007), it was found that a residual\ngravity acceleration effect exists for T \u00d7 R2 but cancels\nto first order for a perfectly regular T 3 model. Here, it\nwas found that the residual acceleration in T 3 does not\ncompletely cancel. In T 3 and two other well-proportioned\nspaces, the octahedral space S 3 /T \u2217 and the truncated cube\nspace S 3 /O\u2217 , the residual acceleration exists as a third order effect in the Taylor expansions in r/La and r/RC respectively. A reasonable upper limit to r/La = r/RC can\nbe set by considering test particles in voids of large-scale\nstructure, i.e., at typically a few megaparsecs from the most\nmassive nearby object, and an injectivity diameter for the\n3-manifold of comoving space of at least a few gigaparsecs,\ni.e., r/La = r/RC \u223c 10\u22123 . Hence, at the present epoch,\nthese three well-proportioned spaces are about a million\ntimes better balanced by this dynamical criterion than illproportioned spaces.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 dodecahedral space S 3 /I \u2217 , presently a\ncandidate 3-manifold for comoving space favoured by several observational analyses, has been found to be even more\nexceptional. Its residual acceleration is dominated by the\n2\nfifth order term of amplitude \u223c \u00b1300(Gm/RC\n)(r/RC )5\n[Figs. 4, 5, Table 1, Eqs (21), (22)]. This makes it about ten\nthousand times better balanced than the other three wellproportioned spaces, i.e., about 1010 times better balanced\nthan ill-proportioned spaces. Moreover, perturbations to\nthis equilibrium favour a return to the equilibrium state.\nAre these clues towards a theory of cosmic topology?\nAcknowledgements.
