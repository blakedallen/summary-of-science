Thus magnetic monopoles represent generic\npredictions of grand unified theories with relevance to particle physics and cosmology. The magnetic charge of magnetic\nmonopoles is proportional to their topological charge. The simplest monopole solution is the spherically symmetric\n't Hooft-Polyakov monopole of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) theory [1, 2], which has unit topological charge. SU(2)\nmultimonopoles carrying higher topological charge cannot be spherically symmetric [3]. They possess at most axial\nsymmetry [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], or no rotational symmetry at all [9, 10].\nIn the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit of vanishing Higgs potential, the monopole and multimonopole\nsolutions satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations [11]. The spherically symmetric BPS monopole solution [12]\nand the axially symmetric BPS multimonopole solutions are known analytically [5, 6, 7]. For these solutions all nodes\nof the Higgs field are superimposed at a single point. BPS multimonopole solutions with only discrete symmetries\nhave recently been constructed numerically [10]. In these solutions the nodes of the Higgs field can be located at\nseveral isolated points.\nThe energy of the BPS solutions satisfies exactly the lower energy bound given by the topological charge. Moreover,\nsince in the BPS limit the repulsive and attractive forces between monopoles exactly compensate, BPS monopoles\nexperience no net interaction [13].\nThe configuration space of YMH theory consists of topological sectors characterized by the topological charge of\nthe Higgs field. As shown by Taubes, each topological sector contains besides the BPS monopole solutions further\nsmooth, finite energy solutions. These do not satisfy the Bogomol'nyi equations, however, but only the second order\nfield equations [14, 15]. Consequently, the energy of these solutions exceeds the Bogomol'nyi bound. The simplest such\nsolution resides in the topologically trivial sector and forms a saddlepoint of the energy functional [14]. It possesses\naxial symmetry, and the two nodes of its Higgs field are located symmetrically on the positive and negative z-axis.\nThis solution corresponds to a monopole-antimonopole pair in static equilibrium [16, 17].\nRecently we have constructed new axially symmetric saddlepoint solutions, where the Higgs field vanishes at m > 2\nisolated points on the symmetry axis [18]. These solutions represent chains of single monopoles and antimonopoles in\nalternating order. For an equal number of monopoles and antimonopoles, the chains reside in the topologically trivial\nsector. When the number of monopoles exceeds the number of antimonopoles by one, the chains reside in the sector\nwith topological charge one.\nThese chains can be generalized by considering not single monopoles and antimonopoles but multimonopoles and\nantimonopoles, carrying each charge n > 1. In chains of charge 2-monopoles and charge 2-antimonopoles the Higgs\nfield still vanishes at isolated points on the symmetry axis [19, 20]. Surprisingly, however, for monopoles of charge\nn > 2 we have encountered a new phenomenon [20]. Here the Higgs field vanishes on rings centered around the\nsymmetry axis, instead of vanishing only at isolated points on the symmetry axis.\nIn this paper we study both types of solutions, representing monopole-antimonopole chains and vortex rings, in\ndetail. We discuss the electromagnetic properties of these solutions, such as their magnetic fields and their magnetic\ndipole moments, and we study the influence of a finite Higgs self-coupling constant on these solutions. Brief discussions\nof such solutions in the BPS limit were given in [18, 20].\n\n\f2\nIn Section II we review SU(2) YMH theory and the topological charge of the configurations. We present the static\naxially symmetric Ans\u00e4tze, and the boundary conditions. We discuss the electromagnetic properties of the configurations, and their 2-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 index [16]. In section III we discuss our numerical results for monopoleantimonopole chains and for solutions with vortex rings. We give our conclusions in section IV.\nII.\n\nSU(2) YANG-MILLS-HIGGS ACTION AND ANS\u00c4TZE\n\nWe here briefly review the SU(2) YMH action and the topological charge. We then discuss the static axially\nsymmetric Ans\u00e4tze for the fields, the boundary conditions for finite energy solutions, the electromagnetic properties\nof solutions, and their 2-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 index.\nA.\n\nLagrangian\n\nThe Lagrangian density of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is given by\n\u2212L=\nwith su(2) field strength tensor\n\n\u00012 i\n1\n\u03bb h\n1\n,\nTr (F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ) + Tr (D\u03bc \u03a6D\u03bc \u03a6) + Tr \u03a62 \u2212 \u03b7 2\n2\n4\n8\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc + ie[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ngauge potential A\u03bc = Aa\u03bc \u03c4 a /2, and covariant derivative of the Higgs field \u03a6 = \u03a6a \u03c4 a in the adjoint representation\nD\u03bc \u03a6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6 + ie[A\u03bc , \u03a6] .\n\n(3)\n\nHere e denotes the gauge coupling constant, \u03b7 the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and \u03bb the strength of\nthe Higgs self-coupling.\nUnder SU(2) gauge transformations U , the gauge potentials transform as\ni\nA\u2032\u03bc = U A\u03bc U \u2020 + (\u2202\u03bc U )U \u2020 ,\ne\n\n(4)\n\n\u03a6\u2032 = U \u03a6U \u2020 .\n\n(5)\n\nand the Higgs field transforms as\n\nThe nonzero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field breaks the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge symmetry to the\nAbelian U(1) symmetry.

In the BPS limit the scalar field also becomes\nmassless, since \u03bb = 0, i.e. the Higgs potential vanishes.\nThe general set of field equations is derived from the Lagrangian by variation with respect to the gauge potential\nand the Higgs field,\n1\nD\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 ie [\u03a6, D\u03bd \u03a6] = 0 ,\n4\n\u0001\nD \u03bc D \u03bc \u03a6 \u2212 \u03bb \u03a62 \u2212 \u03b7 2 \u03a6 = 0 .\nB.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nTopological charge\n\nStatic finite energy configurations of the theory are characterized by a topological charge Q,\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ni\na\nb\nc\nQ=\n\u01ebabc \u03a6\u0302 d\u03a6\u0302 \u2227 \u03a6\u0302 = \u2212\nTr \u03a6\u0302 d\u03a6\u0302 \u2227 d\u03a6\u0302 ,\n2!4\u03c0\n16\u03c0\nS2\n\n(8)\n\nS2\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0302 is the normalized Higgs field, |\u03a6\u0302| = (1/2)Tr \u03a6\u03022 = a (\u03a6\u0302a )2 = 1.

For monopoleantimonopole chains, the contribution from the magnetic charge density and the first contribution from the electric\ncurrent density cancel, yielding the dimensionless magnetic moment Eq. (40).\nF.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 index\n\nIt is instructive to classify nodes |\u03a6| = 0 of the Higgs field, corresponding to the locations of the magnetic charges\nand the vortex rings, by the directions of the Higgs field, surrounding them. Making use of the axial symmetry\nof the solutions, we can associate a Poincar\u00e9 index [16, 24] with these Higgs field configurations. In particular,\nwe define a two-dimensional vector field by considering only two components of the Higgs field in the xz-plane,\n~\n\u03a6(x,\nz) = (\u03a61 (x, z), \u03a63 (x, z)) = |\u03a6|(cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1). (Note, that the \u03a62 component vanishes in the xz-plane.) When the\nHiggs field has an isolated node, located at (x0 , z0 ), we parametrize a unit circle S1 , centered around this node, by\nthe angle \u03b3 \u2208 [0 : 2\u03c0]. The local Poincar\u00e9 index of the Higgs field at (x0 , z0 ) is then given by the map S1 \u2192 S1\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03a61 d\u03b3 \u03a63 \u2212 \u03a63 d\u03b3 \u03a61\nd\u03b1\ni(x0 ,z0 ) =\n=\n(46)\nd\u03b3\nd\u03b3\n2\u03c0\n(\u03a61 )2 + (\u03a63 )2\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b3\nNote that the orientation \u03b1(0) of the vector field at the initial point of the circle S1 distinguishes configurations with\nthe same local Poincar\u00e9 index, as shown for some examples in Fig. 1.\n\n\f7\n\ni=1\n\u03b1(0) = \u03c0/2\n(Center)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b1(0) = 0\n(Node)\n\n\u03b1(0) = \u03c0\n(Node)\n\n\u03b1(0) = \u2212\u03c0/2\n(Center)\n\ni = \u22121\n\ni=2\n\n\u03b1(0) = \u03c0/2\n(Saddle)\n\n\u03b1(0) = 0\n(Double node)\n\ni = \u22122\n\u03b1(0) = 0\n(Double node)\n\ni=0\n\u03b1(0) = 0\n\nFIG. 1: Examples of configurations of a two dimensional vector field, characterized by their Poincar\u00e9 index i and initial angle\n\u03b1(0).\n\n~\nMapping of the vector field \u03a6(x,\nz) at spatial infinity onto the unit circle yields the global Poincar\u00e9 index i\u221e .

Since self-dual solutions precisely saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, the deviation of the\nenergy of the solutions from this bound is a measure for the deviation of the solutions from self-duality.\nWe have constructed such non-BPS solutions numerically, subject of the above boundary conditions, for \u03b8 winding\nnumber 1 \u2264 m \u2264 6, and \u03c6 winding number 1 \u2264 n \u2264 6.\nWe here first briefly address the numerical procedure.

It is therefore essential for the numerical procedure to have a reasonably good initial configuration. (For details see description and related documentation [25].) The equations are discretized on a non-equidistant\ngrid in x and \u03b8. Typical grids used have sizes 70 \u00d7 60 covering the integration region 0 \u2264 x\u0304 \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0. The\nestimates of the relative error for the functions are of the order of 10\u22124 , 10\u22123 and 10\u22122 for solutions with m = 2,\nm = 3, 4 and m = 5, 6, respectively.\nB.\n\nMonopole-antimonopole chains\n\nWe here report our numerical results for monopole-antimonopole chains (MACs), considering first MACs with \u03c6\nwinding number n = 1 and then MACs with n = 2. A brief presentation of monopole-antimonopole chains in the\nBPS limit \u03bb = 0 was given in [18, 20].\n1.\n\nn = 1 chains\n\nLet us consider monopole-antimonopole chains with \u03c6 winding number n = 1 first. These MACs possess m nodes\nof the Higgs field on the z-axis. Due to reflection symmetry, each node on the negative z-axis corresponds to a node\non the positive z-axis. The nodes of the Higgs field are associated with the location of the magnetic charges [17].\nThus these MACs possess a total of m magnetic poles, representing singly charged monopoles and antimonopoles,\nlocated in alternating order on the symmetry axis.\nThe topological charge of these MACs is either unity (for odd m) or zero (for even m). Indeed, for odd m (m = 2k+1)\nthe Higgs field possesses k nodes on the positive z-axis and one node at the origin. The node at the origin corresponds\nto a monopole when k is even and to an antimonopole when k is odd. For even m (m = 2k) the Higgs field does not\nhave a node at the origin.\nThe m = 1 solution is the well-known 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole [1, 2]. The m = 3 (M-A-M) and m = 5 (MA-M-A-M) chains represent saddlepoints with unit topological charge. The m = 2 (M-A) chain is identical to the\nmonopole-antimonopole pair (MAP) discussed before [16, 17].\nBesides by their topological charge, these MACs are characterized by their global Poincar\u00e9 index, i\u221e = m (48).\nThe nodes of the Higgs field themselves are characterized by the local Poincar\u00e9 index i = 1, where the monopoles\nhave \u03b1(0) = 0, and the antimonopoles \u03b1(0) = \u03c0. Examples of the orientation of the 2-dimensional Higgs field\n~\n\u03a6(x,\nz) = (\u03a61 (x, z), \u03a63 (x, z)) in the xz-plane are shown in Fig. 2 for MACs with m = 5, n = 1 and m = 6, n = 1.\n15\n\n10\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nz\n\nz\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nx\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u221215\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nx\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFIG. 2: Higgs field orientation in the xz-plane for monopole-antimonopole chains with m = 5, n = 1 (left) and m = 6, n = 1\n(right); all nodes carry unit Poincar\u00e9 index. The asterisks indicate the location of the nodes of the Higgs field.\n\nIn Fig. 3 we recall the dimensionless energy density for MACs with \u03b8 winding number m = 1, . . . , 6, \u03c6 winding\nnumber n = 1, and Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb = 0 [18]. The energy density of these MACs possesses m maxima\non the z-axis, and is monotonically decreasing with increasing \u03c1. The locations of the maxima are close to the nodes\nof the Higgs field, which are indicated by asterisks. For a given MAC the maxima are of similar magnitude. The\n\n\f9\nheight of the maxima decreases when the number of nodes of the MACs increases. (Note that the scale for the m = 1\nsolution is different compared to m \u2265 2 solutions, and note the distortion because of the different scaling of the \u03c1and z-axis.)\nIn Fig. 4 we present the dimensionless modulus of the Higgs field for the same set of solutions, m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1,\n\u03bb = 0. The modulus of the Higgs field of these MACs possesses m nodes on the z-axis, and is monotonically increasing\nwith increasing \u03c1. The maxima inbetween the nodes are still far from the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field\nfor these MACs in the BPS limit.\nTo demonstrate the influence of the self-coupling of the Higgs field, we exhibit in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the dimensionless\nenergy density and modulus of the Higgs field along the symmetry axis for these MACs at Higgs self-coupling \u03bb = 0\nand \u03bb = 0.5. Note, that the energy density of the \u03bb = 0 MACs has been scaled up by a factor of ten. An increase\nof \u03bb makes the maxima of the energy density higher and sharper. At the same time, the modulus of the Higgs field\ntends faster and further towards its vacuum expectation value inbetween the locations of the monopoles.\nWe present the energy of the MACs with m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1 in Table 1 for several values of the Higgs self-coupling\nconstant \u03bb. The energy E (m) of a chain consisting of m monopoles and antimonopoles is always smaller than the\nenergy of m single monopoles or antimonopoles with infinite separation between them, i. e. E (m) < E\u221e = 4\u03c0\u03b7m.\nOn the other hand E (m) exceeds the minimal energy bound given by the Bogolmolny limit Emin = 0 for even m,\nand Emin = 4\u03c0\u03b7 for odd m. This suggests that a monopole-antimonopole chain is a static equilibrium state of m\nmonopoles and antimonopoles, which is unstable because it exceeds the minimal energy bound.\n\nm/\u03bb\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n0\n1.00\n1.70\n2.44\n3.10\n3.78\n4.40\n\nE[4\u03c0\u03b7]\n0.01 0.5\n1.10 1.35\n1.95 2.48\n2.91 3.74\n3.78 4.91\n4.71 6.14\n5.61 7.31\n\n1\n1.41\n2.60\n3.92\n5.15\n6.41\n7.64\n\n0\n0.0\n4.72\n0.0\n9.86\n0.0\n15.80\n\n\u03bc/n[1/e]\n0.01 0.5\n0.0 0.0\n3.83 3.35\n0.0 0.0\n7.55 6.90\n0.0 0.0\n11.20 9.86\n\n1\n0.0\n3.25\n0.0\n6.68\n0.0\n9.7\n\nTable 1 The dimensionless energy and the dimensionless dipole moment per winding number \u03bc/n of the monopoleantimonopole chains with m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1 for several values of \u03bb.\n\nWe observe an (almost) linear dependence of the energy E (m) on m, independent of \u03bb. In the BPS limit, such a\ndependence is readily obtained by taking into account only the energy of m single (infinitely separated) monopoles\nand the next-neighbour interactions between monopoles and antimonopoles on the chain [18]. Defining the interaction\nenergy as the binding energy of the monopole-antimonopole pair,\n\u2206E = 2E (1) \u2212 E (2) ,\n\n(49)\n\none obtains as energy estimate for the MACs\n(m)\n\nEest = mE (1) \u2212 (m \u2212 1)\u2206E .\n\n(50)\n\nThis energy estimate agrees well with the energies of MACs in the BPS limit \u03bb = 0 [18]. It is less accurate for finite\nvalues of \u03bb, where poles with like charges experience repulsive forces, which are not present in the BPS limit. These\nadditional repulsive forces decrease the binding energy of monopoles within a monopole-antimonopole chain with\nrespect to the binding energy of monopoles in a monopole-antimonopole pair. We therefore propose a new energy\nestimate, where the binding energy \u2206E of a MAP is replaced by an average binding energy \u2206\u1ebc of the MACs. For a\ngiven \u03bb this average binding energy \u2206\u1ebc is extracted by a least square fit. The new energy estimate\n(m)\n\n\u1ebcest = mE (1) \u2212 (m \u2212 1)\u2206\u1ebc ,\n\n(51)\n\nagrees well with the energies of all chains, except for the monopole-antimonopole pairs at finite \u03bb, of course. The new\nenergy estimate is illustrated in Fig. 7. The deviation of the estimated energies from the exact energies is indeed very\nsmall.\nLet us now take a closer look at the location of the nodes of the Higgs field, shown in Table 2 for MACs with\nm = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1, and several values of \u03bb.

The exact energies are exhibited by the symbols.\n\nwithin a chain, and the average distance between the nodes shows a slight increase with m. For instance, for the MAC\nwith m = 5, n = 1, the distances between the nodes are 4.8, while for the MAC with m = 6, n = 1, the distances are\n|z1 \u2212 z2 | \u2248 5.06, |z2 \u2212 z3 | \u2248 5.11 and |z3 \u2212 z4 | \u2248 4.92, (where the location of the nodes is denoted by zi in decreasing\norder,) with an average distance of 5.05.\nAs we increase \u03bb from zero, we observe a decrease in the average distances. For \u03bb = 0.01 the distances between\nthe nodes are almost constant within a chain, and (almost) independent of m, and correspond to an average distance\nof about 3.65. A further increase of \u03bb yields again more variation in the distances between the nodes. On the one\nhand, we observe a further decrease of the average distance between nodes, and we find back a slight dependence of\nthe average distance between nodes on m. On the other hand, for a given MAC the nodes start to form pairs, such\nthat the distance between the nodes of a pair is less than the distance to the neighbouring nodes.\n(i)\n\nx0 = (\u03c1i , \u00b1zi )\nm/\u03bb\n0\n0.01\n0.5\n1\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n2\n(0, 2.1) (0,1.72) (0,1.60)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n3\n(0, 4.67) (0, 3.73) (0, 3.61)\n(0, 2.4) (0, 1.90) (0, 1.97)\n4\n(0, 7.0) (0, 5.46) (0, 5.35)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n5\n(0, 4.8) (0, 3.69) (0, 3.56)\n(0, 9.6) (0, 7.30) (0, 6.85)\n(0, 2.46) (0, 1.77) (0, 1.61)\n6\n(0, 7.57) (0, 5.46) (0, 5.05)\n(0, 12.63) (0, 9.01) (0, 8.21)\n\n1\n(0, 0)\n(0,1.55)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 3.50)\n(0, 1.90)\n(0, 5.17)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 3.67)\n(0, 7.06)\n(0, 1.59)\n(0, 4.99)\n(0, 8.09)\n\nTable 2 The location of the nodes of the Higgs field of the monopole-antimonopole chains with m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1\nfor several values of \u03bb.\n\n\f15\nTurning next to the electromagnetic properties of the monopole-antimonopole chains, we exhibit in Fig. 8 the\nmagnetic field lines of MACs with m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1, and \u03bb = 0. Clearly, MACs with odd m give rise to an\nasymptotic magnetic monopole field, whereas MACs with even m give rise to an asymptotic magnetic dipole field.\nThe magnetic field of the monopole-antimonopole pair, in particular, corresponds to the field of a physical magnetic\ndipole, consisting of magnetic charges, and represents therefore the counterpart of a physical electric dipole field.\nThe magnetic dipole moment of the monopole-antimonopole chains vanishes for odd m. For even m it increases\nalmost linearly with increasing m, as can be seen from Table 1. We obtain an estimate for the dipole moment by\nconsidering only the magnetic charges as sources for the magnetic field. With the charges located at the nodes of the\nHiggs field, the estimate becomes [18]\n\u03bcest (m) =\n\nm\nX\n1\ni=1\n\ne\n\nzi Pi ,\n\n(52)\n\nwith charges Pi = 1 for monopoles and Pi = \u22121 for antimonopoles, respectively. The deviation of these estimated\nmagnetic dipole moments from the exact values is within \u2248 10%. Indeed, the estimate simply corresponds to Eq. (43),\nleaving out the current contribution Eq. (45). Thus we see, that the current contribution is only small, with the two\nterms in the current contribution almost cancelling each other.\nConsidering the \u03bb dependence, we observe that the magnetic moments decrease with increasing \u03bb. In particular,\nthey show already a considerable decrease at \u03bb = 0.01.\n2.\n\nn = 2 chains\n\nLet us now consider chains consisting of multimonopoles with \u03c6 winding number n = 2. These chains also possess\nm nodes of the Higgs field on the z-axis, but these are now associated with the location of double magnetic charges.\nThus these MACs are composed of charge 2-monopoles and charge 2-antimonopoles, located in alternating order on\nthe symmetry axis.\nThe topological charge of these MACs is either two (for odd m) or zero (for even m). The m = 1 solution is the\naxially symmetric multimonopole with charge two [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The m = 3 and m = 5 chains represent saddlepoints\nwith topological charge two. The m = 2 chain, first obtained in a modified model [19], as well as the m = 4 and\nm = 6 chains represent saddlepoints in the vacuum sector.\nThese MACs have vanishing global Poincar\u00e9 index i\u221e . The nodes of the Higgs field themselves are characterized\nby the local Poincar\u00e9 index i = 0, where the monopoles have \u03b1(0) = 0, the antimonopoles \u03b1(0) = \u03c0. Examples of\n~\nthe orientation of the 2-dimensional Higgs field \u03a6(x,\nz) = (\u03a61 (x, z), \u03a63 (x, z)) in the xz-plane are shown in Fig. 9 for\nsolutions with m = 1, n = 2, and m = 2, n = 2.\nIn Fig. 10 we exhibit the dimensionless energy density of m-chains with m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 2, and Higgs selfcoupling constant \u03bb = 0 [20]. The energy density of axially symmetric multimonopole solutions has a toruslike\nshape. Consequently, the energy density of these MACs composed of charge 2-monopoles and charge 2-antimonopoles\nrepresents a superposition of m tori, located symmetrically with respect to the nodes of the Higgs field. In particular,\nthe rings formed by the maxima of the energy density lie in planes parallel to the xy-plane, intersecting the symmetry\naxis close to the nodes of the Higgs field. As for the chains composed of singly charged monopoles and antimonopoles,\nthe maxima of the energy density of these MACs composed of doubly charged monopoles and antimonopoles are of\nsimilar magnitude for a given MAC, while their height decreases when the number of nodes of the MACs increases.\n(Note the distortion in the figure because of the different scaling of the \u03c1- and z-axis.)\nIn Fig. 11 we present the dimensionless modulus of the Higgs field for the same set of solutions, m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 2,\nand \u03bb = 0.\nAn increase of the Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb makes the maxima of the energy density higher and sharper,\nand at the same time, the modulus of the Higgs field tends faster and further towards its vacuum expectation value\ninbetween the locations of the monopoles. This is seen in Fig. 12, where we illustrate the energy density of these\nMACs for \u03bb = 0.5, and in Fig. 13, where we compare the modulus of the Higgs field along the symmetry axis for these\nMACs for \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 0.5.\nWe exhibit the energies of MACs with with m = 1, . . . , 6 and n = 2 in Table 3 for several values of the Higgs\nself-coupling constant \u03bb. As for the n = 1 MACs, the energies of these n = 2 MACs also increase (almost) linearly\nwith m, and can be modelled well with the energy estimate Eq. (51), as seen in Fig. 14.

The exact energies are exhibited by the symbols.\n\nshown in Table 4 for several values of \u03bb. When each pole carries charge two, the monopoles and antimonopoles\nexperience a higher mutual attraction, which results in an overall smaller equilibrium distance between the poles, and\nthus a shorter length of the chains (as measured by the largest nodes).\nThe equilibrium distance of the monopole-antimonopole pair composed of n = 2 multimonopoles is considerably\nsmaller than the equilibrium distance of the monopole-antimonopole pair composed of n = 1 monopoles. Thus the\nhigher attraction between the poles of a pair with charge n = 2 is balanced by repulsion only at a smaller equilibrium\ndistance.\nFurthermore, when each pole carries charge n = 2, the nodes of the Higgs field are no longer roughly equally spaced,\nnot even for small and vanishing Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb, in contrast to n = 1 MACs. Instead the nodes form\npairs (for all values of \u03bb), where the distance between the monopole and the antimonopole of a pair is less than the\ndistance to the neighbouring monopole or antimonopole, belonging to the next pair. In the BPS limit, for instance,\nthe distances between the nodes of the MAC with m = 5, n = 2, are 3.2 for the outer pairs, but 4.1 between the inner\nnodes, and for the MAC with m = 6, n = 2, the distances between the nodes are 3.12 for the outer pairs, 3.74 for the\ninner pair, but 4.21 for the nodes between the pairs.\nThe effect of a finite Higgs self-coupling \u03bb on the location of the nodes is more complicated for chains with n = 2 than\nfor chains with n = 1. In particular the charge 2-monopole charge 2-antimonopole pair shows a strong non-monotonic\n\u03bb dependence of its nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 15.\nThe magnetic moments of MACs with with m = 1, . . . , 6 and n = 2 are shown in Table 3 for several values of the\nHiggs self-coupling constant \u03bb [26]. The magnetic moments of these MACs also increase (almost) linearly with m for\nthe chains with even m, and vanish of course for chains with odd m. Also, with increasing \u03bb, the magnetic moments\nof these MACs decrease. The simple estimate Eq. (52), however, no longer represents a good approximation for the\nmagnetic moments of these n = 2 MACs. Here the electric current contributes significantly to the magnetic moments.\nIn Fig. 16 we exhibit the magnetic field lines of MACs with m = 1, . . . , 6 and n = 2 in the BPS limit. The chains\nwith odd m give rise to an asymptotic magnetic monopole field, whereas the chains with even m give rise to an\nasymptotic magnetic dipole field.\nC.\n\nVortex rings\n\nLet us now consider solutions with \u03c6 winding number n > 2. In the BPS limit, when n > 2, the solutions completely\nchange character [20]. The Higgs field of n > 2 solutions then possesses vortex rings, instead of possessing only isolated\nnodes on the symmetry axis, i.e., the Higgs field vanishes on rings in the xy-plane or in planes parallel to the xy-plane\n[20].\n\n\f23\n1.1\n\n1\n\nz\n\n0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1/2\n\n\u03bb\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 15: The location of the positive node of the Higgs field is shown as function of \u03bb for the charge 2-monopole charge\n2-antimonopole pair, i.e., m = 2, n = 2.\n\nAs seen above, in monopole-antimonopole chains with n = 1 the nodes of the Higgs field, indicating the locations\nof the monopoles and antimonopoles, are roughly equally spaced (with a small tendency towards forming pairs for\nthe larger values of the Higgs self-coupling constant). In chains consisting of charge 2-monopoles and charge 2antimonopoles, however, the nodes of the Higgs field always form pairs, when possible, and the equilibrium distance\nbetween the poles of a pair is less than the equilibrium distance to the neighboring poles. At the same time the\nequilibrium distance between the poles of a pair composed of n = 2 multimonopoles is less than the equilibrium\ndistance between the poles of an n = 1 pair, indicating that the higher attraction between the poles of an n = 2 pair\nis balanced by repulsion only at a smaller equilibrium distance.\nIf this trend were to continue for monopole-antimonopole chains consisting of poles with charge n > 2, the poles of\nthe pairs would approach each other still further, and settle at still smaller equilibrium distances, if possible. When\nconstructing solutions with \u03c6 winding number n = 3 in the BPS limit, however, we do not find chains at all. Thus\nthere is no longer sufficient repulsion to balance the strong attraction between n = 3 poles within pairs, to keep the\npoles apart at a finite equilibrium distance.\nFor n = 3 then, instead of solutions possessing only isolated nodes on the symmetry axis, solutions with vortex\nrings arise, where the Higgs field vanishes on closed rings centered around the symmetry axis. For even \u03b8 winding\nnumber m, the solutions possess only vortex rings and no nodes on the symmetry axis. These solutions reside in the\ntopologically trivial sector. For odd \u03b8 winding number m, the solutions possess vortex rings as well as a node at the\norigin, where a charge n-monopole is located. Thus these solutions reside in the topological sector with charge n.\nIn the following we first consider solutions in the topologically trivial sector, and then solutions with charge n. We\nalso address the influence of a finite Higgs self-coupling constant on these solutions.\n1.\n\nVortex solutions with n > 2 and even m\n\nLet us begin with considering the even m solutions, since they are simpler in structure than the odd m solutions.\nIn monopole-antimonopole chains then all m = 2k nodes are members of a pair. These k pairs in solutions with n = 2\nthen give rise to k vortex rings in solutions with n \u2265 3 in the BPS limit. This is demonstrated below for solutions\nwith m = 2, 4 and 6, respectively. The structure of the solutions may be more complicated, when finite values of \u03bb\nare employed.\nm = 2 solutions\nWe start with the simplest set of vortex solutions, namely solutions with m = 2 and n \u2265 3. In order to gain more\ninsight, into how the solutions with vortex rings arise, we consider unphysical intermediate configurations, where we\nallow the \u03c6 winding number n to vary continuously between the physical integer values.\nAs observed above, the equilibrium distance of the nodes of the monopole-antimonopole pair decreases considerably,\nwhen the \u03c6 winding number n is increased from one to two, and we expect this trend to continue when n increases\nfurther. Indeed, when n is (continuously) increased beyond two, we observe that the nodes of the solutions continue\n\n\f24\n\nFIG. 16: The field lines of the magnetic field are shown as function of \u03c1 and z for monopole-antimonopole chains with\nm = 1, . . . , 6, n = 2, in the BPS limit (\u03bb = 0).

Instead the node of the Higgs field changes its character. As n is increased further, the node\nmoves onto the \u03c1-axis and forms a vortex ring in the xy-plane. With further increasing n this vortex ring increases in\nsize. At the physical value n = 3, the solution thus possesses a vortex ring. When n is increased further, the vortex\nring increases further in size. The n dependence of the node(s) of the Higgs field in the vicinity of the critical value\n\u00f1 is shown in Fig. 17 for m = 2 solutions in the BPS limit.\n1.5\n\nz\n0\n\u03c1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nz ,\u03c1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n2\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\nn\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\nFIG. 17: The (positive) node of the Higgs field is shown as function of n for solutions with m = 2 in the BPS limit (\u03bb = 0)\n(solid the z-coordinate of the pole, dotted the \u03c1-coordinate of the vortex ring).\n\nWe exhibit in Fig. 18 the dimensionless energy density for solutions with \u03c6 winding number n = 3, 4, 5, and Higgs\nself-coupling constant \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 0.5. In these solutions, the energy density is torus-like. The maximum of the\nenergy density then also forms a ring. The height of the maximum decreases with increasing n, and its location moves\nfurther outwards. With increasing Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb, the maximum becomes higher and sharper.\nIn Fig. 19 we present the dimensionless modulus of the Higgs field for the same set of solutions, n = 3, 4, 5, \u03bb = 0\nand \u03bb = 0.5. With increasing n, the location of the vortex ring moves outwards. For small Higgs self-coupling constant\n\u03bb the ring size increases strongly with n, while for large \u03bb it increases much less and (almost) linearly with n. Thus\nfor fixed n and increasing \u03bb, the size of the ring is getting smaller. With increasing \u03bb, furthermore, the modulus of\nthe Higgs field tends faster and further towards its vacuum expectation value away from the vortex ring.\nThe location of the maximum of the energy density is close to the location of the vortex ring of the Higgs field for\nlarge Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb. For small \u03bb the maximum of the energy density is located slightly beyond the\nvortex ring.\nWe exhibit the energies of these vortex solutions with m = 2, n = 3, . . . , 6, in Table 5 for several values of the Higgs\nself-coupling constant \u03bb. With increasing \u03bb, the energies increase.

We observe that the radius of the\nvortex ring grows roughly linearly with n, for all values of \u03bb considered.\nLet us now inspect the Higgs field at the location of the vortex ring. For a vortex solution with odd \u03c6 winding\nnumber n, the nodes of the Higgs field in the xz-plane have local Poincar\u00e9 index +1, thus the global Poincar\u00e9\nindex is i\u221e = 2, while for a vortex solution with even n the nodes of the Higgs field have local Poincar\u00e9 indices\n(1)\n(2)\ni(x0 ) = 1; i(x0 ) = \u22121, and the global Poincar\u00e9 index is i\u221e = 0.

The asterisks indicate the location of the vortex ring.\n\nm = 2 solutions, with n = 3, . . . , 6, shown in Table 5, also increase with n. (\u03bc/n increases almost linearly with n).\nFor fixed n, the magnetic moments decrease with increasing \u03bb.\nIt is tempting to interpret the origin of the magnetic dipole moment as mainly arising from the vortex ring of the\nHiggs field in the xy-plane. Inspection of the magnetic field of the solutions, as exhibited in Fig. 22, seems to support\nthis interpretation. Indeed, the figure seems to suggest that the ring represents a one-dimensional dipole density of\nmathematical magnetic dipoles, giving rise to the magnetic field.\nFor a better understanding of the physical significance of the vortex rings, we exhibit in Fig. 23 and Fig. 24 for\nthe m = 2, n = 3 solution the vector potential A\u03c6 and the magnetic field lines in the vicinity of the vortex ring,\nrespectively. The vector potential A\u03c6 is discontinuous at the vortex ring. The vortex ring itself clearly appears as a\nsource of magnetic field lines.\nAs demonstrated in section 2, the magnetic moment of solutions without magnetic poles arises solely from the\n~ , representing a dipole density, present inside the\ncurrent j\u03c6 (see Eq. (44)). Let us introduce the magnetization M\ncore of these vortex solutions, and interpret the presence of the current in terms of the magnetization,\n~ \u00d7M\n~ .\n~jel = \u2207\n\n(54)\n\nThe fraction \u03bc(r) of the dipole moment \u03bc of the vortex solutions present inside a sphere of radius r (centered at the\norigin) is then obtained from\nZ\n2\n\u03bc(r) = \u2212\u03c0 j\u03c6 r\u2032 sin \u03b8d\u03b8dr\u2032 ,\n(55)\nwith \u03bc(\u221e) = \u03bc. The function \u03bc(r) thus gives a clear picture, where the magnetization is localized.\nWe exhibit the function \u03bc(r) in Fig. 25 for the vortex solution with m = 2, n = 3, in the BPS limit and for \u03bb = 1.\nAs expected, we obtain little contribution to \u03bc(r) from the central region. As the radius approaches the size of the\nvortex ring, we first obtain a negative contribution to \u03bc(r). At the radius of the vortex ring, \u03bc(r) rises discontinuously,\nand continues to rise steeply close behind the vortex ring. Then \u03bc(r) levels off towards its asymptotic value. The\nbiggest change of \u03bc(r) happens clearly in the vicinity of the vortex ring.\nm = 4 solutions\nLet us next turn to the vortex solutions with m = 4. When n = 2, two monopole-antimonopole pairs are located on\nthe symmetry axis, consisting of charge 2-monopoles and charge 2-antimonopoles. When we increase the \u03c6 winding\nnumber n beyond two, via unphysical configurations with non-integer n, we observe that the nodes of each pair get\ncloser until they merge on the symmetry axis at the points (0, \u00b1z\u0303), when n reaches the critical value \u00f1. When n is\nincreased further, these two nodes leave the axis and form two vortex rings located symmetrically in planes parallel\nto the xy-plane. At the physical value n = 3, the solution has thus two vortex rings. With further increasing n, the\nvortex rings increase in size.\nWe exhibit in Fig. 26 the energy density, the modulus of the Higgs field, and the magnetic field of the vortex\nsolutions with m = 4, n = 3 and \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 0.5. With each vortex ring of the Higgs field a maximum of the\nenergy density is associated. Thus the energy density of these vortex solutions consists of two tori. (This is in contrast\nto the four tori present in the monopole-antimonopole chains with n = 2.) An increase of the Higgs self-coupling\nconstant \u03bb makes the maxima of the energy density higher and sharper. At the same time, the modulus of the Higgs\nfield tends faster and further towards its vacuum expectation value away from the vortex rings.\n\n\f30\n\nFIG. 22: Field lines of the magnetic field are shown as function of \u03c1 and z for solutions with m = 2, n = 3, 4, 5, in the BPS\nlimit (\u03bb = 0) and for \u03bb = 0.5.

Also shown are the magnetic moments. Again, with increasing \u03bb, the energies increase, and\nthe magnetic moments decrease. The energies further increase (almost) linearly with n, and can be modelled well by\nthe estimate Eq. (53).\nThe location of the two vortex rings of these solutions is shown in Table 8. We observe that the radius of the vortex\nrings grows with n, while their distance from the xy-plane decreases with n, yielding an (almost exact) linear growth\nof the distance of the vortices from the origin with n, for all values of \u03bb considered. Furthermore, for finite \u03bb the\nradius of the vortex rings is smaller, and they are closer to the xy-plane.\nE[4\u03c0\u03b7]\n\u03bc/n[1/e]\nn/\u03bb 0 0.01 0.5\n1\n0 0.01 0.5 1\n3 6.63 9.36 15.01 16.22 9.96 6.03 3.75 3.50\n4 8.00 11.74 19.07 20.57 10.65 6.08 3.81 3.58\n5 9.25 14.01 22.84 24.65 11.40 6.23 3.94 3.72\nTable 7 The dimensionless energy and the dimensionless dipole moment per winding number \u03bc/n of the vortex solutions with m = 4, n = 3, . . . , 5 for several values of \u03bb.\n(i)\n\nx0 = (\u03c1i , \u00b1zi )\nn/\u03bb\n0\n0.01\n0.5\n1\n3 (3.06, 3.10) (1.83, 1.90) (1.63, 1.68) (1.57, 1.60)\n4 (5.44, 2.81) (3.16, 1.59) (2.30, 1.52) (2.16, 1.47)\n5 (7.45, 2.62) (4.19, 1.40) (2.85, 1.43) (2.67, 1.40)\nTable 8 The location of the nodes of the Higgs field of the vortex solutions with m = 4, n = 3, . . . , 5 for\nseveral values of \u03bb.\nInspection of the Higgs field at the location of the vortex ring shows, that for a vortex solution with odd n, the nodes\nof the Higgs field have local Poincar\u00e9 index +1, yielding i\u221e = 4, while for a vortex solution with even n the nodes of\nthe Higgs field have local Poincar\u00e9 indices \u00b11, yielding i\u221e = 0.

The asterisks indicate the location of the vortex rings.\n\nm = 6 solutions\nConsidering vortex solutions with m = 2k > 2 we now obtain the following scenario. Starting from k pairs of\nphysical dipoles located on the symmetry axis, these pairs merge to form k vortex rings, when n is increased beyond\ntwo. The k vortex rings then move further outwards when n is increased further.\nWe illustrate this scenario for the case of m = 6 in Fig. 28, where we exhibit the energy density, the modulus of the\nHiggs field, and the magnetic field of the vortex solutions with m = 6, n = 3 and \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 0.5.

Intriguingly, however, the central\nvortex ring of the vortex solution with n = 3 decreases so strongly in size, that it shrinks to zero size at a critical value\nof the Higgs self-coupling constant \u03bb, while the outer rings retain a finite size.

The asterisks indicate the location of the vortex rings.\n\nand a charge 3-monopole charge 3-antimonopole pair appears on the symmetry axis, as \u03bb is increased further. The\nsolution is then a mixed configuration with two vortex rings and a monopole-antimonopole pair. With increasing \u03bb\nthe poles then increase their distance, until they reach some maximal distance. A further increase of \u03bb then decreases\nthe distance of the pair again, until at a second critical value of \u03bb the poles merge again at the origin. When \u03bb is\nincreased still further, a central vortex ring is formed again.\n2.\n\nVortex solutions with n > 2 and odd m\n\nLet us now turn to the solutions with odd \u03b8 winding number m, and with \u03c6 winding number n > 2, residing in the\ntopological sector with charge n.\nThe monopole-antimonopole chains, present for n = 1 and n = 2, possess m = 4k \u2212 1 or m = 4k + 1 nodes on the\nsymmetry axis, with one node always located at the origin. When m = 4k + 1, there are 2k nodes on the positive\nz-axis and 2k nodes on the negative z-axis, forming a total of 2k pairs. These pairs give rise to 2k vortex rings for\nsolutions with n \u2265 3. This is demonstrated below for solutions with m = 5, which possess two vortex rings. For\nsolutions with m = 4k \u2212 1 the situation is more complicated, since in addition to the central node at the origin, there\nare two more unpaired nodes on the symmetry axis. Here a new mechanism arises, which gives rise to vortex rings.\nConsequently, the odd m solutions consist of one or more vortex rings and a multimonopole of charge n. Thus they\nform vortex-monopole bound systems.\nm = 5 solutions\nApart from the additional node located at the origin, the evolution of the nodes of the m = 4k + 1 solutions with\nincreasing n is similar to the case of solutions with even m, discussed above. When n increases (continuously), the\nsingle n-monopole located at the origin remains an isolated pole, whereas the other nodes form pairs, where the two\npoles approach each other, merge and then form a ring, increasing in size with n.\nBefore the poles of the pairs merge, they represent positive physical dipoles on the positive z-axis and negative\ndipoles on the negative z-axis. Thus because of their symmetry w.r.t. reflection on the xy-plane, their dipole moments\ncancel, and the total magnetic moment of the configuration vanishes accordingly. As the poles of the pairs merge and\nthe nodes form rings, the magnetic moment remains zero, as it must, because of the symmetry of the ansatz. The\nelectric current contributions, associated with the vortices in the upper and lower hemisphere, cancel.\nA finite Higgs self-coupling does not change this pattern. Only the maxima of the energy density are getting higher\nand sharper, as seen in Fig. 30, for the solution with m = 5 and n = 3, for \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 0.5, corresponding to the\nfirst such solution (where k = 1). Shown in the figure are also the modulus of the Higgs field and the magnetic field.\nThe energy density of the m = 5 solution consists of the three tori. The outer two of these tori are associated with\nthe vortex rings, while the inner torus represents the torus-like energy density of the multimonopole at the origin.\nThe m = 5 solution is thus a bound system of two vortices and a multimonopole.\nThe energies of the m = 5 vortex-monopole bound systems with n = 3, . . . , 5 are presented in Table 11 for several\nvalues of \u03bb. Their magnetic moments vanish. The energies show again an (almost) linear dependence on n, and are\nwell approximated by Eq. (53). They increase with \u03bb. The location of the vortex rings is exhibited in Table 12. The\ndistance of the vortex rings from the central monopole increases (almost) linearly with n. The vortex rings decrease\nin size and move closer to the xy-plane, when \u03bb is increased.\n\n\f37\n\nFIG. 30: The dimensionless energy density, the dimensionless modulus of the Higgs field, and the field lines of the magnetic\nfield are shown as function of \u03c1 and z for vortex-monopole bound system with m = 5, n = 3 in the BPS limit (\u03bb = 0) and for\n\u03bb = 0.5.\n\n\f38\n\nn/\u03bb\n3\n4\n5\n\nE[4\u03c0\u03b7]\n0\n0.01 0.5\n7.96 11.66 19.18\n9.59 14.66 24.69\n11.10 17.55 29.95\n\nTable 11 The dimensionless energy of the vortex-monopole bound systems with m = 5, n = 3, . . . , 5, for\nseveral values of \u03bb.\n\n(i)\n\nx0 = (\u03c1i , \u00b1zi )\nn/\u03bb\n0\n0.01\n0.5\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n3\n(3.11, 5.16) (1.74, 3.07) (1.64, 2.68)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n4\n(5.69, 4.73) (3.10, 2.59) (2.35, 2.32)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 0)\n5\n(7.88, 4.44) (4.16, 2.25) (2.93, 2.09)\nTable 12 The location of the nodes of the Higgs field of vortex-monopole bound systems with m = 5, n = 3, . . . , 5,\nfor several values of \u03bb.\nFor vortex-monopole bound systems with m = 5 and odd n, all local Poincar\u00e9 indices are one, yielding i\u221e = 5;\nwhile for even n i\u221e = 0, where, the local Poincar\u00e9 index of pole at the origin is zero, and the indices of the vortices\nare \u00b11.\nm = 3 solutions\nLet us finally consider monopole-vortex bound systems with with m = 4k\u22121. Here the situation is more complicated,\nsince in addition to the central node at the origin, there are two more unpaired nodes, one on each side of the symmetry\naxis. Clearly, a new mechanism must be involved, which can give rise to vortex rings. At the very least, one could\nimagine that, as n increases, the unpaired nodes (corresponding to monopoles) and the central node (corresponding\nto an antimonopole) merge at the origin, and then give rise to a vortex ring in the xy-plane, while a monopole remains\nat the origin. The vortex ring itself, however, should then be of a different type, since no magnetic moment might be\nassociated with it.\nTo gain some understanding of the structure of the m = 4k \u2212 1 solutions and of the mechanism giving rise to\nvortex rings, we consider the simplest case (k = 1), and thus solutions with m = 3. Again we treat the winding\nnumber n as a continuous parameter and consider unphysical intermediate configurations with non-integer n beyond\nthe n = 2-chain. We then obtain a new surprising scenario, illustrated in Fig. 31, where we show the dependence of\nthe nodes of the Higgs field on n, for m = 3 solutions in the BPS limit.\nAs seen in the figure, for n = 2, we start with a configuration with a monopole on the positive z-axis, an antimonopole\nat the origin and another monopole on the negative z-axis. All poles carry charge two. Thus in the initial state there\nare three poles located on the z-axis. Clearly, these cannot form a pair while respecting the symmetries. Thus a new\nmechanism is required.\nWhen n is increased beyond two, the poles approach each other, i.e., the monopoles on the symmetry axis move\ntowards the antimonopole at the origin. But before the monopoles reach the origin, a bifurcation occurs at a critical\nvalue of n, \u00f1 = 2.72, where vortex rings emerge from the monopoles on the symmetry axis. The dipoles of the vortex\nrings have opposite orientation and therefore keep the magnetic moment of the solutions equal to zero. When n is\nincreased further, the vortex rings increase in size and move closer to the xy-plane. At the same time, the monopoles\non the symmetry axis further approach the origin, until they merge with the antimonopole. Thus a single node is left\non the symmetry axis, located at the origin. For the physical value of n = 3 we thus observe a solution with a pole\nat the origin and two vortex rings in planes parallel to the xy-plane.\nAs n is increased further, beyond n = 3, the pole at the origin, also bifurcates at a critical value of n, and sprouts\na vortex ring. The vortex ring is of a different type, however, since no dipole field is associated with it, and it does\nnot contribute to the magnetic moment. This central vortex ring is located in the xy-plane and grows in size with\n\n\f39\n\n6\n\nz, \u03c1\n\n4\n\nz0\n\u03c10\nz\n1\n\u03c1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nn\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 31: The locations of the nodes of the Higgs field are shown as functions of n, for solutions with m = 3 in the BPS limit\n(\u03bb = 0).

For n = 4 the solution then represents a bound system composed of a pole at the origin and three vortex\nrings.\nAs n is increased still further, beyond n = 4, the two vortex rings above and below the xy-plane approach this\nplane, and at the same time the size of the third vortex ring, located in the xy-plane, approaches the size of these\ntwo vortex rings. Therefore at a further critical value \u00f1 = 4.8, all three rings merge, leaving a single vortex ring in\nthe xy-plane. The n = 5 solution therefore is a bound system composed of a pole at the origin and a single vortex\nring, located in the xy-plane.

(Note the\n\n\f40\ndifferent scales for n = 1 and n \u2265 2.) For the chain with n = 2 we observe a superposition of three tori, each\ncorresponding to a multimonopole. For n = 3 the energy density still consists of a superposition of three tori, but\nnow only the central torus corresponds to the energy density of a multimonopole, whereas the outer tori represent\nthe energy density of vortex rings. For n = 4 the various contributions to the energy density are no longer resolved,\nbut form a single broad torus, which becomes flatter and grows in size with further increasing values of n.\nWe exhibit in Fig. 34 contour lines of the modulus of the Higgs field and the field lines of the magnetic field of the\nsolutions with m = 3 and n = 3, . . . , 5, in the BPS limit (\u03bb = 0). One clearly sees the dipole patterns associated\nwith the upper and lower vortex rings, while no such pattern appears for the central vortex ring, present in the n = 4\nsolution. The single vortex ring of the n = 5 solution clearly reveals its composed structure, by keeping the dipole\npatterns from the former outer vortex rings.\nInspecting the Higgs field at the location of the nodes of the \u03bb = 0 solutions, we note, that for the n = 3 solution\nthe local Poincar\u00e9 index at the origin is \u22121, whereas the other four indices are 1, thus i\u221e = 3. For the n = 4 solution\ni\u221e = 0, and the index of the node at the origin is zero as well, whereas for the n = 5 solution the index of the node\nat the origin is 1, yielding together with the indices of the nodes of the ring i\u221e = 3. The Higgs field orientation for\nsolutions with m = 3, n = 2, . . . , 5, in the BPS limit is illustrated in Fig. 35.\nWe exhibit the energies of the solutions with m = 3, n = 3, . . . , 5, in Table 13 for several values of the Higgs\nself-coupling constant \u03bb. The magnetic moments vanish. Again, with increasing \u03bb, the energies increase. Also the\nenergies of these solutions increase (almost) linearly with n, and can thus be modelled well by the estimate Eq. (53),\neven though they change their structure considerably with n, possessing first two vortex rings, then three and finally\na single one.\nThe location of the nodes of these solutions, the central node and the vortex rings, is shown in Table 14. The radius\nof the vortex rings grows with n. and the distance of the outermost vortex ring(s) from the origin again shows an\n(almost) linear growth.

The solutions are characterized\nby two integers, their \u03b8 winding number m and their \u03c6 winding number n. Solutions with even m carry no magnetic\ncharge but possess a non-vanishing magnetic dipole moment, whereas solutions with odd m carry unit magnetic charge\nbut possess no magnetic dipole moment.\nFor n = 1 and 2, the solutions represent monopole-antimonopole chains, where monopoles and antimonopoles are\nlocated in alternating order on the symmetry axis at the nodes of the Higgs field. Each monopole or antimonopole\ncarries charge \u00b1n, m corresponds to the total number of monopoles and antimonopoles. We interpret these monopoleantimonopole chains as equilibrium states of m monopoles and antimonopoles.\nThe force between monopoles is given by twice the Coloumb force when the charges are unequal, and vanishes\nwhen the charges are equal, provided the monopoles are at large distances [13]. Thus, monopoles and antimonopoles\ncan only be in static equilibrium, when they are close enough to experience a repulsive force that counteracts the\nattractive Coloumb force. Monopole-antimonopole chains are essentially non-BPS solutions.\nWhereas for n \u2264 2 the Higgs field vanishes on m discrete points on the symmetry axis, for n > 2 a new phenomenon\noccurs. The nodes of the Higgs field then no longer only form a set of isolated points, located on the symmetry axis.\nInstead the nodes of the Higgs field can form vortex rings, centered around the symmetry axis.\nWhen m is even, i.e.,m = 2k, the monopoles and antimonopoles of the n = 2 monopole-antimonopole chains form\nk pairs. The dipole moments from these pairs all contribute additatively to the magnetic moment of the chain.\nIn the BPS limit, these give rise to k vortex rings, when n > 2. Now these vortex rings are associated with the\nmagnetic moment of the solutions. When the Higgs self-coupling constant is finite, solutions with both vortex rings\n\n\f44\nand monopole-antimonopole pairs can arise.\nWhen m is odd, we need to consider the cases m = 4k + 1 and m = 4k \u2212 1 separately. When m = 4k + 1, the\nmonopoles and antimonopoles of the n = 2 monopole-antimonopole chains form 2k pairs, where a single monopole\nremains at the origin. Here the contributions to the dipole moment from the pairs on the upper and lower symmetry\naxis cancel. These pairs give rise to 2k vortex rings, when n > 2. Again, the dipole contributions from the vortex\nrings cancel. The solutions represent vortex-monopole bound systems.\nWhen m = 4k \u2212 1, a new mechanism arises, leading to vortex rings. Here there are three unpaired poles on the\nsymmetry axis in the n = 2 monopole-antimonopole chains, an antimonopole located at the center and two monopoles\nlocated symmetrically w.r.t. the center. In such solutions vortex rings are (now also) sprouted from these two unpaired\nmonopoles, when n > 2. Interestingly, also the node at the origin can bifurcate and give rise to a vortex ring. This\nring, however, is different in character, since it is not associated with a dipole field.\nAs outlined in [22, 28], analogous dyonic solutions can be readily obtained from these chains, vortex solutions, and\nvortex-monopole bound systems. Interestingly, such solutions then carry electric charge even in the vacuum sector.\nWhen the gravitional interaction is included, we anticipate a different behaviour for solutions with finite magnetic\ncharge and those with vanishing magnetic charge. For magnetically charged solutions a degenerate horizon may form\nfor a critical value of the gravitional parameter, as observed for monopoles [29] and multimonopoles [30]. On the\nother hand, no formation of a horizon was found for the gravitating monopole-antimonopole pair [31].\nWe expect that solutions analogous to the chains exists also in the Weinberg-Salam model [21, 32, 33], generalizing\nthe sphaleron-antisphaleron pair [33]. The axially symmetric Ansatz with \u03c6 winding number n and \u03b8 winding number\nm [21] then should allow for multisphaleron\u2013antimultisphaleron chains and for solutions with vortex rings.\nRings of vanishing or small Higgs field are also present in Alice electrodynamics, where they carry magnetic Cheshire\ncharge [34], while closed knotted vortices can arise in theories, allowing for solutions with non-trivial Hopf number\n[35].\nAcknowledgments\n\nY.S. is grateful to Stephane Nonnemacher, for helpful discussions, and in particular for clarifying the issue of the\n2d index of vector fields, and to Ana Achucarro, Pierre van Baal, Adriano Di Giacomo and Dieter Maison for very\nuseful discussions and remarks.\nB.K. gratefully acknowledges support by the DFG under contract KU612/9-1.\n\n\f45\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n\nG.
