This has been first achieved in the context of the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 / N = 4 duality[4] and then\nextended to some of its variations [5], including a case involving open strings/fundamental\nmatter [6]. Another interesting dual pair which has been extensively studied in the past\n[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] is given by IIB string theory on AdS3 \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 M, where M is either T 4 or\nK3 on one side and an N = (4, 4) two-dimensional CFT correponding to the sigma model\nM N /SN , In the Penrose limit this background gives rise an exactly solvable (in the lightcone gauge, Green-Schwarz formulation) pp-wave [4, 7] string background. Purpose of this\npaper is to provide some detailed quantitative tests of the duality between string theory\non this pp-wave and above 2D CFT. The first step towards establishing the duality is of\ncourse to provide a correspondence between the states of the two theories: on the string\ntheory side we have the ground state(s) and the states built with massive and massless\n(for T 4 case) oscillators, including zero modes. We will propose a precise correspondence,\nguided by the action of supersymmetry on the states on the two theories. On the CFT side\n\u221a\nthe corresponding class of states is characterized large R-charge J, J \u223c N , and J itself\nis identified with the n of Zn twisted sectors.\nAfter identifying ground states with chiral primary states of the CFT and massless\noscillator modes with first level descendants of the left-moving N = 4 algebra generators\n, J0\u2212 , (and similarly for the right-moving one, L\u03031 , G\u0303\u2212\n, J \u03030\u2212 ) we move on to massive\nL1 , G\u2212\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\noscillators, which will be identified with certain, say, left fractionally moded descendants,\n, J\u2212\u2212 k , with k << J, acting on the ZJ ground states. These\nwith generators L\u22121+ k , G\u2212\n\u22121+k\nJ\n\n2\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nstates are right-chiral at the orbifold point, but become non-chiral when the orbifold is\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nresolved by switching on a Z2 blowing up mode. The necessity of moving off the orbifold\npoint or, in other words, the fact that the point in moduli space where the CFT is dual\nto the pp-wave is not the orbifold point, is suggested by the spectrum of the light-cone\nHamiltonian, p\u2212 , to be identified in the CFT with \u2206\u2212J , \u2206 being the conformal dimension\nof the state. The spectrum is composed of two contributions. Let us consider the first\none, which is due to the massive oscillators from the pp-wave part of the background,\nand, therefore, has the typical square-root form, implying that the conformal dimensions\nof the corresponding states admit an expansion in powers of g62 N/J 2 , where g6 is the 6dimensional string coupling, much like what happens in the Yang-Mills case [4]. We will\nsee that switching on the blowing-up mode has the effect of lifting the class of states\nin consideration, which are right-chiral (and therefore belong to short multiplets) at the\norbifold point and of making four of them to join into long multiplets. As a condequence,\ntheir conformal dimensions are unprotected and are expected to receive corrections. We\nwill verify this fact by showing that the (right-moving) supercharges are indeed modified\nin presence of the blowing up mode.\nThe occurrence of this phenomenon will be also supported by a partition function\ncomputation on the two theories, which, as we will see, also suggests the presence of a\nsupercharge with a Z2 twist nature, in agreement with the explicit CFT argument. We will\nperform a CFT calculation of the leading order change in the conformal dimension, finding\nagreement with the first order expansion of the square root formula from the pp-wave side.\nThe second term in the p\u2212 Hamiltonian is due, in the T 4 case, to the usual massless\noscillators (we do not consider momenta and windings along T 4 ). This contribution is\nproportional to 1/J. We propose that on the CFT side these correspond to fractional\nmodes of the U(1)4L \u00d7 U(1)4R super-current algebra acting on the ground states on both\nleft- and right-moving sectors, subject to the level matching condition. First order CFT\nperturbation theory gives, also for these states, results in qualitative agreement with the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\npredictions from string theory spectrum.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly review AdS3 /CFT2 duality\nand its Penrose limit. The supersymmetry generators of the pp-wave limit of the N (4, 4)\nalgebra are constructed in section 3. In particular we find that the anti-commutator of\nthe left and right supercharges is proportional to the world-sheet momentum operator P\u03c3\nand therefore vanishes on the physical states. In section 4, we present the computation\nof the first order corrections to the conformal dimensions in the boundary CFT. Finally\nwe discuss the question of higher order corrections and, assuming a natural identification\nbetween the states on the two sides, we show that the exact expression for the conformal\ndimensions imply an extension of the superalgebra: the anticommutator between the left\nand right supercharges vanishes on the orbifold group invariant states but not on individual\nfractional oscillators. This is exactly analogous to the results obtained in section 3 for the\npp-wave strings.\nWhile this paper was in progress, three papers appeared, [13, 20] and [15] addressing\nsome of the issues discussed here and overlapping partially with ours.\n\n2.\n\nAdS3/CFT2 Duality and its Penrose Limit\nIn this section we review the basic facts about the duality between IIB string theory on\n\nAdS3 \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 M and the two dimensional boundary CFT corresponding to the symmetric\nproduct M N /SN . On the string theory side, the above background arises as near horizon\ngeometry of a system of Q1 D1-branes and Q5 parallel D5-branes wrapped on M, in the\nlimit where both Q1 and Q5 are large at fixed Q1 /Q5 . The radius R of both AdS3 and S 3 is\n\u221a\ngiven by R2 = \u03b1\u2032 g6 N , with N = Q1 Q5 . g6 is the six dimensional effective coupling given\nq\n5\n. String theory on such background\nin terms of the IIB string coupling gs as g6 = gs Q\nQ1\nis believed to be dual to certain two dimensional N = (4, 4) SCFT in the Neveu-Schwarz\n\nsector. The CFT corresponds to the orbifold sigma model M N /SN , possibly blown-up,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndepending on the values of spacetime moduli which survive the near horizon limit.\nThere have been several tests of this duality, mainly at the level of spectrum of protected\noperators [9, 10, 11, 12]. In particular, as first done in [10], the elliptic genus of the CFT\nhas been compared with the one, suitably defined, of supergravity. The two have been\nshown to agree for low energy excitations [10, 11, 12]. Notice that, in this comparison, one\nis including also multiparticle supergravity states, but our discussion here will be focused\nonly on supergravity (string theory) single particle states. For our later purposes, it will\nbe useful to reconsider such computations. The elliptic genus involves states of the form\n(anything, chiral), but actually it does not keep track of the JR3 R-quantum numbers of\nthe right-moving Ramond ground states, since one sets the conjugate variable \u1ef9 to q\u0304 \u22121/2\n3\n\nin the character valued partition function1 , trN S (\u2212)F q L0 \u2212c/24 y JL . One may ask then what\nhappens if we keep arbitrary \u1ef9 for the chiral states in the partition function. In general one\ndoes not expect the resulting partition function to be a topological quantity, and indeed it\nwas already observed in [12] that in this case there is a discrepancy between supergravity\nand CFT results. We want to analyze this point in more detail. From the CFT side,\nthe partition function for M N /SN is best obtained via a generating function ZCF T =\nP N\nN\nN p Z(M /SN ) which can be easily computed once the multiplicities for the single copy\nCFT cCF T (m, l, m\u0304, l\u0303) are given. Taking into account only states which correspond to single\n\nparticle supergravity states, i.e. the states coming from the twisted sectors corresponding\nto single cycles, amounts to consider\nZCF T (p, q, q\u0304, y, \u1ef9) =\n\nX\n\ncCF T (4mn \u2212 n2 \u2212 l2 , 4m\u0304n \u2212 n2 \u2212 l\u03032 )pn q m y l q\u0304 m\u0304 \u1ef9 l\u0303\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the multiplicities cCF T 's are obtained from the single copy CFT partition function.\nThe single particle partition function for states of the form (anything, chiral) on the supergravity side is computed via the prescription of [10], once the spectrum of chiral primaries\n1\n\nThe elliptic genus is defined in the Ramond sector, where one usually sets \u1ef9 = 1, but we need to flow\n\nto the NS sector, for the reason explained before.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nis known (which happens to coincide with the cohomology of M), and has an expansion of\nthe form2 :\nZsugra =\n\nX\n\ncsugra (n, m, l)pn q m y l (\u1ef9 q\u0304 1/2 )l\u0303\n\n(2.2)\n\nn,m,l,l\u0303\n\nLet us recall that the agreement between elliptic genera for states of low conformal dimensions (m \u2264 N/4) amounts to the equality ZCF T (p = 1, q, y) = Zsugra (p = 1.q, y) and\n\u2202\nZ\n(p, q, y)|p=1\n\u2202p CF T\n\n=\n\n\u2202\nZ\n(p.q, y)|p=1,\n\u2202p sugra\n\nthat is, the two elliptic genera differ by an ex-\n\npression of the form (p \u2212 1)2 g(p, q, y). In the above discussion we have set \u1ef9 = q\u0304 \u22121/2 , which\nis the value corresponding to the elliptic genus flowed in the NS sector. However using the\ntechniques explained in [10, 12], one can repeat the analysis for the case where one considers\nright- moving chiral states with the appropriate power of \u1ef9 given by their R-charge. We\nwill not repeat here the calculation, but what one gets is that the CFT and supergravity\npartition functions differ by an expression of the form (1 \u2212 pq\u0304 1/2 \u1ef9)2 f (p, q, y, q\u0304 1/2\u1ef9). This\nsuggests that what can happen in the CFT is that four short multiplets, coming from the\nsectors n, (1), n + 1, (2) and n + 2, (1) respectively can join into a long multiplet and\ndrop from the elliptic genus. In other words, one may expect that, as we move in the CFT\nmoduli space, the Higgs mechanism can take place and assemble short multiplets (whose\nnumber is a multiple of four) into long ones. We will explicitly prove in the next section\nthat this is indeed what happens, and we will identify these states with a class of (massive)\nstring oscillator states on the pp-wave background.\nLet us consider now the Penrose limit of the AdS3 \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 M background [4, 15]. This\nis obtained by blowing up a region near a null geodesic in AdS3 \u00d7 S 3 . It involves a scaling\nlimit where R \u2192 \u221e with \u03b1\u2032 , gs and g6 finite. The resulting metric becomes\nds2 = \u22122dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc2 (x2 + y 2 )dx+ dx\u2212 + d~x2 + d~y 2 + ds2M\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere ~x and ~y are two- dimensional vectors, parametrizing a four-dimensional transverse\n2\n\nThe crucial prescription in this derivation has to do with the notion of degree formulated in [10],\n\nallowing to discuss finite N in supergravity, and therefore to introduce the variable p.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nflat space. There are in addition non trivial vev's for the RR 3-form field strength, H+12 =\nH+34 = \u03bc.\nThe light-cone momenta in this background,p+ = i\u2202x\u2212 and p\u2212 = i\u2202x+ , where p\u2212 is\nthe light-cone hamiltonian, are identified with the following combinations of charges in the\nCFT:\np\u2212 = \u03bc(\u2206 \u2212 J)\np+ = J/\u03bcR2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the total conformal dimension in the CFT and J is the U(1) R-symmetry charge\n3\nJ = JL3 +JR3 , with JL,R\nCartan currents in the SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R R-symmetry algebra of the\n\nN = (4, 4) SCFT. Unitarity in the CFT gives \u2206 \u2212 J \u2265 0, corresponding to non-negativity\nof the light-cone hamiltonian. The ground states of the latter correspond to chiral primary\nstates in the CFT. The requirement of considering finite energy excitations in the limit\n\u221a\nR \u2192 \u221e (i.e. N \u2192 \u221e), demands to take J \u223c N with \u2206 \u2212 J finite.\nThe spectrum of the light-cone hamiltonian is found to be [4, 7]\nX r\nLM + L\u0303M\nn\n\u2212\np =\nNn 1 + ( + \u2032 )2 + 0 + \u20320\n\u03bcp \u03b1\n\u03bcp \u03b1\nn\n\n(2.5)\n\nwith the level-matching constraint on the occupation numbers Nn :\nX\nn\n\nM\nNn = LM\n0 \u2212 L\u03030\n\n(2.6)\n\nM\nwhere LM\n0 and L\u03030 are left- and right-moving Virasoro generators for the CFT corresponding\n\nto M.\nWith the identifications given above, in particular \u03bcp+ \u03b1\u2032 = J/gs Q5 , we can translate\nthe pp-wave spectrum (2.5) into the following statement for the CFT spectrum:\nr\nM\nX\nngs Q5 2\nLM\n0 + L\u03030\n) + gs Q5\nNn 1 + (\n\u2206\u2212J =\nJ\nJ\nn\nOur main goal will be to reproduce (2.7) directly from the CFT.\n\n(2.7)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n3.\n\nSymmetry Generators\nWe now identify the N = (4, 4) generators on the two sides, namely string theory on\n\nthe pp-wave and two-dimensional CFT.\nIn the pp-wave background, the mass terms break the light-cone SO(8) symmetry down\nto SO(2) \u00d7 SO(2)\u2032 \u00d7 SO(4) where the first and second SO(2) factors act on the directions\ncoming from AdS3 (say directions X 1 and X 2 ) and S 3 (say X 3 and X 4 ) respectively while\nthe SO(4) acts on the tangent space of T 4 (or K3 ). The generators of the first and the\nsecond SO(2) therefore should be identified with L0 \u2212 L\u03030 and j\u03030 \u2212 j0 respectively. The total\ndimension \u2206 and charge J are \u2206 = L0 + L\u03030 and J = j\u03030 + j0 . The fields X I , I = 1, .., 4 are\nmassive while the directions along the T 4 which we denote by Y i are massless.

These fermions satisfy the reality conditions \u03b8\u0304\u03b1a\n= \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u01ebab \u03b8\u03b2b\nand similarly\n\n\u03c7\u0304i\u03b1\u0307\u0227 = \u01eb\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 \u01eb\u0227\u1e03 \u03c7i\u03b2\u0307 \u1e03 .

The zero modes of \u03c7 generate the cohomology of T 4 :\nthe two complex left-moving zero modes and two complex right-moving zero modes acting\non the ground state reproduce the cohomology elements hp,q of T 4 .\nFor later convenience it is better to organize the fields in terms of definite SO(2)\u00d7SO(2)\u2032\ncharges.

One can verify that the anti-commutation relations between these G's\n+\nare correct. In particular the anticommutator {G\u2212\n1/2 , G\u22121/2 } defines L0 \u2212 j0 and similarly\n\nfor the tilde operators. As a consistency check one finds that\n+b\n\u2212a\n+b\nab\nab\nab \u2212\n{G\u2212a\n1/2 , G\u22121/2 } + {G\u03031/2 , G\u0303\u22121/2 } = \u01eb (L0 \u2212 j0 + L\u03030 \u2212 j\u03030 ) = \u01eb (\u2206 \u2212 J) = \u01eb P\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u2213\n\u00b1\nNote that while G\u00b1\n\u22131/2 anticommutes with G\u0303\u00b11/2 as they should, with G\u0303\u22131/2 they anti-\n\ncommute only on physical states in the pp-wave string theory, i.e. the states that satisfy\n\n\f\u201310\u2013\nthe level matching condition. Indeed we find\n\u2212b\nab\n{G\u2212a\n1/2 , G\u03031/2 } = \u01eb\n\n1\n1 X\nkNk = \u01ebab + P\u03c3\n+\n2p\n2p\n\n(3.11)\n\nk\n\nwhere Nk is the oscillator number operator at momentum k on the pp wave side and P\u03c3 just\ndenotes the total momentum. This might seem strange, but does not create any problem\nsince on the physical states these anti-commutators vanish. We will see in section 5, the\nanalog of the pp-wave physical state condition as well as the analog of this anti-commutator\nin the dual perturbed boundary CFT.\nFrom this identification it is clear that the insertion of zero mode creation operators of\nthe massive fields on the pp-wave side correspond to the insertions of L\u22121 , L\u0303\u22121 , J0\u2212 , J \u03030\u2212\n\u2212\u00b1\n(bosonic) and G\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2 , G\u0303\u22121/2 on the boundary CFT side.\n\nHow about the non-zero modes on the pp-wave side. It is natural to identify them with\n\u2212\n\u2212\nthe insertions of fractional modes of L\u22121+k/n , L\u0303\u22121+k/n , Jk/n\n, J \u0303k/n\n(bosonic) and G\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2+k/n ,\n\nG\u0303\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2+k/n acting on the Zn twisted sector of the boundary CFT (here k can be positive or\nnegative but is assumed that |k| << n 3 ).\nHowever, one immediately comes up against an apparent contradiction to this proposal.\n\u2212\nConsider for instance a state in the boundary CFT of the form Jk/n\nG\u2212b\n\u22121/2\u2212k/n |n >\u2261 \u03a81 ,\n\nwhere |n > denotes the chiral-chiral ground state in the Zn twisted sector with left and\nright charges being (n \u2212 1)/2. This state is non-chiral in the left moving sector but is chiral\non the right sector. It therefore must be in a (intermediate) BPS multiplet. In other words\nG\u0303+a\n\u22121/2 annihilates this state. On the other hand according to our proposal this state is to\n\u2020 2b +\n>, where p+ is essentially n. It is easy to see, from the\nbe identified with a1\u2020\n\u2212k (b )k |p\n\nexplicit expression of G\u0303+a\n\u22121/2 given in (3.9), that it does not annihilate this state. In fact\n3\n\n\u2212\nnote that Jk/n\nfor positive but small k are still creation operators acting on the Zn twisted chiral state\n\nwhich carries a positive charge equal to (n \u2212 1)/2, n/2 or (n + 1)/2 corresponding to different cohomologies\nof the T 4 . The different cohomology elements are obtained by applying the massless fermion zero modes\non the pp wave side\n\n\f\u201311\u2013\nit transforms the state into\n\n1\u2020 +\nd(k)a1\u2020\n\u2212k ak |p\n\n> where the coefficient d(k) = sign(k)\n\nq\n\n\u03c9k \u2212p+\n2p+\n\nis an odd function of k and in the large p+ limit it is k/p+ . This state according to our\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2032\ndictionary is proportional to the state Jk/n\n\u2032 J\u2212k/n\u2032 |n >\u2261 \u03a82 in the boundary CFT for some\n\nn\u2032 . By examining the charges we can conclude that n\u2032 = n+ 1. In any case this implies that\nif the dictionary between boundary CFT and pp-wave string is correct then such states on\nboundary CFT side must become non-chiral via some Higgs mechanism, i.e. several (4 in\nthis case) intermediate multiplets should join together to give a long multiplet. The fact\nthat the Zn twisted sector is mapped to the Zn+1 twisted state suggests that this Higgs\nmechanism is provided by the exactly marginal Z2 twist field acquiring a non-vanishing\nexpectation value.\nAnother way to see this problem is that the state \u03a81 in the boundary CFT has \u2206\u2212J = 2\np\nwhile the corresponding state on the pp-wave side has \u2206 \u2212 J = 2 1 + k 2 /(p+ )2 \u223c 2 +\n\n+b\nk 2 /(p+ )2 + ... Since L\u03030 \u2212 j\u0303 = {G\u0303\u2212a\n+1/2 G\u0303\u22121/2 }, the change in the dimension can be obtained\n\nby computing the change in G\u0303 under the marginal deformation. In particular, since the\nchange in the dimension is not zero, the state cannot be a chiral primary. In the next\nsection we will compute the first order change in G\u0303+a\n\u22121/2 due to the marginal deformation\nand show that the state \u03a81 indeed is mapped to state \u03a82 with the coefficient d(k).\nAssuming that the identification between the pp-wave string states and the boundary\nCFT states is correct, we can then summarize the action of G\u0303 on the various left moving\nexcitations, in the large J limit, as follows:\n\u2212b\n\u221a\nG\u0303+a\n\u22121/2 : G\u22121/2+k/n |n >\u2192\n\nL\u22121+k/n |n >\u2192 \u221a\n\nk\nG\u2212a\n|n + 1 > ,\n+\n2p \u22121/2+k/(n+1)\n\n\u2212b\n\u221a\nG\u0303\u2212a\n1/2 : G\u22121/2+k/n |n >\u2192\n\u2212\nJk/n\n|n >\u2192 \u221a\n\nk ab \u2212\n\u01eb Jk/(n+1) |n + 1 > ,\n2p+\n\nk ab\n\u01eb L\u22121+k/(n\u22121) |n \u2212 1 > ,\n2p+\n\nk\nG\u2212a\n|n \u2212 1 > .\n+\n2p \u22121/2+k/(n\u22121)\n\n(3.12)\n\n\f\u201312\u2013\nwhere p+ = J/g6 \u223c n/g6 . The action of G\u0303 on the right moving fields is the usual in the large\nJ limit. Note that the third and fourth lines in the above equation are just the Hermitian\nconjugate of the first and second lines.\nAnother question that comes up with this identification is that, while the massive nonzero mode creation operators commute among themselves and thereby ordering of these\noperators is irrelevant in the definition of the states, on the boundary CFT side, the corre\u2212\nsponding operators do not commute among themselves. While L\u22121 , G\u2212a\n\u22121/2 and J0 commute\n\namong themselves (which correspond to the zero modes on the pp-wave side), the fractional\nmoded operators do not commute. Thus it would appear that different orderings of these\noperators will give rise to different states. The point, however is that the difference between\ndifferent orderings vanishes in the sense of norm and inner products, in the large J limit.\nConsider for example the states ( n1 L\u22121+k/n J \u2212 \u2212k/n)|n > and ( n1 J \u2212 \u2212k/nL\u22121+k/n )|n >. The\nfactor 1/n is just included to have properly normalized states (in the large J limit). The\ndifference between these two states is\n\nk \u2212\nJ |n\nn2 \u22122\n\n>, whose inner product with either of the\n\nabove states is of order 1/n2 and the norm is of order 1/n3 . Thus in the large J (or\nequivalently large n) limit all the different orderings can be identified with a single state.\nFinally we turn to the pp-wave string states made up of modes of massless fields. As\nmentioned earlier, the two SO(2)s acting on the complex fields X 2 and X 1 respectively are\nidentified with L0 \u2212 L\u03030 and j\u0303 \u2212 j respectively. This is also clear from eq.(3.8). The bosonic\nmassless fields are neutral with respect to the two SO(2)s and therefore The states created\nby them must carry L0 = L\u03030 and j = j\u0303. The Fermionic massless field \u03c7\u03b1\u0307\u0227 are anti-chiral\nwith respect to the SO(4) which breaks down to the product of these two SO(2)s and\ntherefore carry opposite quantum numbers with respect to the two SO(2)s. Thus states\ncreated by these operators must have L0 \u2212 j = L\u03030 \u2212 j\u0303. Since L0 \u2212 j measures how far the\nstate is from being chiral, such states, on the boundary CFT side, must be equally nonchiral on both left and right moving sectors. It is natural to conjecture that the positive and\n\n\f\u201313\u2013\nnegative momentum k modes of the T 4 (or K3) operators on the pp-wave side (i.e. left and\nright moving modes on the pp-wave side) should be mapped to states obtained by applying\nleft and right moving k/n fractional moded T 4 (or K3) operators in the Zn twisted sector\non the boundary CFT side. The creation operators (for simplicity we consider here T 4 or\nin case of K3 its orbifold limit) acting on Zn twisted chiral-chiral primary state are the left\n+a\n\u2212a\nmoving fermionic operators \u03c8\u22121/2\u2212k/n\nand \u03c81/2\u2212k/n\n(for a = \u00b1) and the bosonic operators\ni\n\u03b1\u2212k/n\n(i = 1, . . . , 4) with k > 0 and similarly for the right movers. On the pp wave side the\n\nlight cone Hamiltonian \u2206 \u2212 J is proportional to k/p+ . This means that on the boundary\nCFT side we must show that even after perturbation the dimension is proportional to k/n.\nIn the following we study the first order correction to supergenerators and show that to\np\nthis order it gives a structure constant proportional to k/n.\n\n4.\n\nCorrelators in the resolved (T 4)N /SN CFT and first order correction to the conformal dimensions\nAs anticipated in the previous section, we need to consider correlation functions in\n\nthe symmetric product CFT, perturbed by the marginal deformation corresponding to\nthe blowing up mode, which resolves the Z2 orbifold singularity. For earlier work on the\nsymmetric product CFT see [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\nAlthough some of the considerations below apply both to the (K3)N /SN and (T 4 )N /SN\ncases, the explicit computations will be performed for the latter case. The first question we\nwant to address is the modification of the supersymmetry generators when the blowing up\nmode is turned on. We will discuss this change to first order in the marginal perturbation,\nfollowing an argument given in [22] for the case of the Virasoro generators.\nRecall that the blowing up mode is obtained from the chiral primary field \u03c3 1 , 1 in the\n2 2\n\nZ2 twisted sector, of left- right- dimensions (1/2,1/2), by applying the left- and right-\n\n\f\u201314\u2013\nand G\u0303\u2212a\n, where a = +, \u2212 denotes the doublet components of\nmoving supercharges G\u2212a\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\na global SU(2)I which is an outer automorphism of the N = (4, 4) algebra. Together\n+a\nwith the conjugate charges G+a\n, G\u0303\u2212\n1 they are part of the global N = (4, 4) symmetry\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\nof the CFT. Here the explicit + and \u2212 refer to the components of a doublet with respect\n\n \u0303\nto the global left- and right SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)\nR R-symmetry charges, which are also part\nof the N = (4, 4) algebra. Therefore there are actually four blowing up modes, which\n \u0303\nare top components of a short (4,4) multiplet and are neutral under the SU(2)R , SU(2)\nR\n\nCartan generators, but transform as 3 + 1 of SU(2)I . We will be interested in perturbing\nthe symmetric product CFT with the singlet component, corresponding to a particular\ncombination of RR zero- and four-form vev's in the type IIB background. This is given by\nan antisymmetric combination of left and right supercharges acting on the chiral primary\nfield, so that the complete expression for the perturbation is:\nG\u0303\u2212\u2212 \u2212 G\u2212\u2212\nG\u0303\u2212+ )\u03c3 1 , 1 + a.c.\n\u03bb(G\u2212+\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the coupling constant, a.c. refers to the expression involving the antichiral field\n\u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 with the hermitean conjugate supercurrents G+\u00b1 , G\u0303+\u00b1 .\n2 2\n\nWe will be interested in studying the action of the right-moving charges G\u0303+a\n, on states\n\u22121\n2\n\n(or fields) which are chiral primary on the right-moving sector and excited on the leftmoving sector. By definition, G\u0303+a\nannihilates such states if the blowing up modes are\n\u22121\n2\n\nswitched off. So let us consider bringing down in a correlator involving these fields the\nblowing up mode of (4.1) to first order, and look at the action of G\u0303+a\n: this is represented\n\u2212 12\nH\nby a contour integral C dz\u0304 G\u0303+a (z\u0304) where the contour C encircles the positions of all the\nother fields, including the perturbation which is integrated over the plane:\n<\n\nI\n\n+a\n\ndz\u0304 G\u0303 (z\u0304)\n\nC\n\nY\ni\n\n\u03c6i (zi , z\u0304i )\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\u03c31,1 (x, x\u0304) >\n\n(4.2)\n\nG\u0303\u2212b \u03c3 1 , 1 is the blowing up mode.

The integral around x can be evaluated using o.p.e.'s:\n\n\f\u201315\u2013\nthe interesting term comes from writing\n\u03c31,1 (x, x\u0304) =\n\nI\n\nCx\n\nb\nd\u0233\u01ebab G\u0303\u2212a (\u0233)\u03c31,\n1 (x, x\u0304) ,\n\n(4.3)\n\n2\n\n\u2212b\nb\nand using the o.p.e. of G\u0303+\u00b1 (z\u0304) with G\u0303\u2212\u2213 (w\u0304). In (4.3) \u03c31,\n1 = G 1 \u03c31,1 .\n\u2212\n2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nThe simple pole in this o.p.e is given by:\n\nG\u0303+\u00b1 (z\u0304)G\u0303\u2212\u2213 (w\u0304)|simple\n\npole\n\n= (T\u0303 (w\u0304) + \u2202 \u0304J \u03033 (w\u0304)/(z\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304),\n\n(4.4)\n\n,\nwhere T\u0303 and J \u03033 are respectively the right-moving stress energy tensor and Cartan\na\ncurrent of the SU(2)R R-symmetry. Recalling the o.p.e. of T\u0303 with \u03c31,\n1 (x, x\u0304), one sees that\n2\n\nthis gives a total derivative in x\u0304:\nZ\n\n \u0304 a 1 (x, x\u0304)\nd x\u2202\u03c3\n1,\n2\n\n2\n\nY\n\n\u03c6i (zi , z\u0304i ) =\n\ni\n\nXI\n\nCzi\n\ni\n\ndx\u03c31, 1 (x, x\u0304)\u03c6i (zi )\n2\n\nY\n\n\u03c6j (zj , z\u0304j )\n\n(4.5)\n\nj6=i\n\nThis motivates the following expression for the first order change in the supercharge in the\npresence of the blowing up mode:\n\u03b4 G\u0303+a\n\u03c6 (0)\n\u2212 21 i\n\n=\u03bb\n\nI\n\na\ndx\u03c31,\n1 (x, x\u0304)\u03c6i (0)\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\nWe have considered here the chiral part of the perturbation, the first term in (4.1), however\nit is easy to see that the antichiral gives the same result (4.9): the reason is that \u03c3 and \u03c3\u0304\nare members of an SU(2)R doublet,\n\u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 =\n2 2\n\nI\n\n\u2212\n\nJ (z)\n\nI\n\ndz\u0304 J \u0303\u2212 (z\u0304)\u03c3 1 , 1 .\n2 2\n\n(4.7)\n\nBut then if we move J \u2212 and J \u0303\u2212 across G+ and G\u0303+ respectively, we get back G\u2212 and G\u0303\u2212 ,\nso that, in fact, the two terms in (4.1) are identical 4 .\n4\n\nWe have omitted here, and it will also be understood in the following when not strictly necessary, the\n\nSU (2)I index on the various fields.\n\n\f\u201316\u2013\nWe se therefore that there is a change in G\u0303+ if there is a simple pole 1/x in the o.p.e\nbetween \u03c6 and \u03c31, 1 . If this is the case, and this will be verified shortly, four states which\n2\n\nbelong to intermediate multiplets of the (4,4) supersymmetry at the orbifold point should\njoin into long multiplets when turning on the blowing up mode.\non a given field \u03c6 amounts to fusing \u03c31, 1 with \u03c6. Now\nMoreover, the action of \u03b4 G\u0303+\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c31, 1 is in the Z2 twisted sector and \u03c6 is in the Zn twisted sector, so this gives a state in the\n2\n\nZn+1 twisted sector when the corresponding two-cycle (i1 , i2 ) and n-cycle (j1 , . . . jn ) have\none index in common. There will be also a transition from Zn to Zn\u22121 when the two-cycle is\ncontained in the n-cycle, and this will be the essentially CPT conjugate amplitude involving\n\u03b4 G\u0303\u22121 with the exchange of in- and out-states 5 . Following basically the same steps leading\n2\nH\nin the correlator of (4.2) as C z\u0304 G\u0303\u2212a (z\u0304), deforming the contour\nto (4.9), i.e. inserting \u03b4 G\u0303\u2212a\n1\n2\n\nand using the o.p.e. between G\u0303\u2212\u00b1 (z\u0304) and G\u0303+\u2213 (w\u0304), whose relevant part is given by:\n\nG\u0303\u2212\u00b1 (z\u0304)G\u0303+\u2213 (w\u0304) \u223c\n\n2J \u03033 (w\u0304)\nT\u0303 (w\u0304) \u2212 \u2202 \u0304J \u03033 (w\u0304\n\u2212\n+ ***,\nz\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304\n(z\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304)2\n\n(4.8)\n\none can prove the following equation:\n\u2212a\n\n\u03b4 G\u0303 1 \u03c6i (0) = \u03bb\n2\n\nI\n\na\ndxx\u0304\u03c3\u03041,\n1 (x, x\u0304)\u03c6i (0)\n2\n\n(4.9)\n\nis determined by the 1/xx\u0304 singularity in the o.p.e. between\nIn this case therefore \u03b4 G\u0303\u2212a\n1\n2\n\n\u03c3\u0304\n\n1, 21\n\n(x, x\u0304) and \u03c6.\n\nThere is however a priori a possibility of transitions from a Zn -sector state to a Zn\u22121 state\nwhich is genuinely different from the previous one. Notice that in the previous discussion\nwe had, on the right-moving sector, chiral states which correspond to a cohomology element\nwith 0 degree on the right6 Now, R-charge conservation alone on the right-moving sector\n5\n\nNotice that the proper twist fields should correspond to conjugacy classes of SN , and those correspond-\n\ning to n-cycles can be obtained from the twist field corresponding to a given n-cycle by averaging over the\nSN group orbit.\n6\nThe single particle cohomology elements of (T 4 )N /SN from a given Zn twisted sector inherit the\n\n\f\u201317\u2013\nwould allow a transition via a Z2 twist field from a Zn chomology element at degree 0 to a\nchomology element in the Zn\u22121 of degree 2 (two fermions applied). Similar considerations\nhold for the conjugate process. We will verify in the following, by an explicit computation\nthat the corresponding amplitude in fact vanishes.\nFinally, if the incoming two- and n-cycles are disjoint, then one obtains an outgoing\ncycle which corresponds to a two-particle state and this will not be of interest for us.\nThe above picture agrees with the result found in section 2, where we have seen that\nthe discrepancy between the supergravity and CFT single-particle partition functions, for\n1\n\n1\n\nstates which are right-moving chiral, is of the form (1 \u2212 q\u0304 2 \u1ef9p)2 f (p, q, q\u0304 2 \u1ef9), with some given\nfunction f . This indeed means that the three supermultiplet's components come from\n(n, n + 1, n + 2) twisted sectors, in agreement with the Z2 twisted character of the modified\nsupercharges discussed above.\nWe would like now to analyze in more detail the fusion of \u03c31, 1 with the left-moving\n2\n\nexcited field in the Zn -twisted sector. We will be interested in a particular class of such\nfields, namely those obtained by applying an arbitrary string of fractionally moded gen\u2212\nand J \u2212\nerators L\u22121+ k , G\u2212,a\nm , where L's and J 's are the modes of the stress energy\n\u22121+ l\nn\n\n2\n\nn\n\nn\n\ntensor and of the negatively charged R-symmetry current respectively. The integers k, l, m\nare assumed to be much smaller than n in absolute value, i.e. |k|, |l|, |m| << n and have\nto satisfy orbifold group invariance condition, which demands, in the present case, that\nP\nP\nP\nthe total fractional mode should vanish, i.e.\nli +\nki +\nmi = 0. This condition\n\ncorresponds precisely to the level matching condition on the pp-wave side, equation (2.6).\n\nBefore discussing the relevant three-point functions, let us consider first the unperturbed\ntwo-point functions involving one of these fields and its conjugate. This correlator will\nDolbeault degrees (p, q) of the original T 4 , with p, q = 0, 1, 2. In the CFT, p = 0 (q = 0) corresponds to\nthe basic Zn twist field on the left (right), whereas p = 1, 2 (q = 1, 2) correspond to applying one or two\nleft- (right-) moving invariant fermions, respectively, with positive R-charge. This increses the dimension\nand the charge by the same amount so that the resulting field is still chiral primary.\n\n\f\u201318\u2013\ninvolve multiple insertions of an even number of T 's, of pairs of G+ 's and G\u2212 's and of J + 's\nand J \u2212 's. The particular mode insertion can be then obtained by a contour integration\naround the positions of the chiral and conjugate anti-chiral external fields. The following\nobservation will be useful when we will discuss the perturbed two point functions: in the\nlarge n limit we are interested in, the leading contribution to this correlator comes from\n\"diagonal\" contractions, where each of the above generators is contracted with a conjugate\ngenerator. The reason for this comes from the fact that in the o.p.e. of two conjugate\noperators one finds schematically T , T + \u2202J3 or J3 . When bringing these operators near\nthe chiral primary in the Zn twisted sector, they will give a contribution of order n, because\nthey will measure the dimension or the charge (or the sum of the two) of the corresponding\nfield, which is (n \u2212 1)/2. Off-diagonal contractions will be suppressed with respect to the\ndiagonal ones by powers of n. This argument also says that in order to have two-point\n\u221a\nfunctions of order 1, we should normalize the generators with a 1/ n factor.\nThis observation facilitates the analysis of the three point function, i.e. the two point\nfunction involving the blowing up mode to first order, as far as the leading contribution for\nlarge n is concerned. In this case of course the presence of the blowing up mode forces the\ntwo external excited states to be non-diagonal. However, from the previous argument, the\nleading contribution will arise when all the generators inserted will be contracted diagonally,\napart from a pair which has to connect through \u03c31, 1 . The upshot of this argument is that\n2\n\none can concentrate on the part of the correlator which involves a \"flip\" of the generators\nvia the interaction \u03c31, 1 . Charge conservation then restricts the consideration to two type\n2\n\n7\n\nof correlators :\nC1 (u) = < n + 1|J\u2212+\n\nk\nn+1\n\nC2 (u) = < n + 1|G+\n+1\u2212\n2\n\n7\n\n\u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b)G\u2212\n|n >,\n\u22121+k\n2\n\nk\nn+1\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b)L\u22121+ k |n >,\n2\n\nn\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe following correlators are understood as part of a correlator which involve states satisfying the\n\norbifold group invariance condition.\n\n\f\u201319\u2013\nwhere |n > and |n + 1 > denote ground states in the Zn and Zn+1 twisted sector\nrespectively.\nBefore turning to a more detailed computation, let us observe that the u, \u016b dependence\nof the three-point functions in (4.10) (or rather of the full three-point function, involving\nphysical states obeying level-matching condition) is fixed by the conformal dimensions of\nthe three fields, and therefore it is of the form cn,n+1 /u, where cn,n+1 is a structure constant,\nand we have assumed that the external twist fields are at 0 (Zn ) and \u221e (Zn+1 ). Therefore\nthe non-trivial task for our purposes is the determination of the leading n dependence\nof the structure constants, and this will give us the action of the modified right-moving\nsupercharges on the excited states we are interested in.\nIn order to perform the computation of the above correlators it is convenient to introduce\na covering map from the plane t, on which the correlator is single valued, the original plane\nz on which it has the appropriate monodromies. This map can be chosen to be:\nz = tn (t \u2212 t0 ),\n\n(4.11)\n\nwith some arbitrary parameter t0 . This is a branched covering, with branch point of order\nn at t = 0, of order n + 1 at t = \u221e and of order 2 at x = nt0 /(n + 1), where the Z2 twist\nfields is located. This map thus realizes the required monodromies. Denoting with u the\nvalue of z at t = x, we have\nu = z(x) = \u2212xn+1 /n.\n\n(4.12)\n\nIn terms of the t coordinate the scalar correlator is simply\n\u2202X(z)\u2202 X\u0304 (w) =\n\nt\u2032 (z)t\u2032 (w)\n(t(z) \u2212 t(w))2\n\n(4.13)\n\nIt is also convenient to bosonize the two complex fermions \u03a8+\u00b1\nby introducing two canonI\nically normalized scalar fields H1I and H2I as follows\n\u221a\n\u03a8++\n= exp (iH1I + iH2I )/ 2\nI\n\u221a\n\u03a8+\u2212\n= exp (iH1I \u2212 iH2I )/ 2,\nI\n\n(4.14)\n\n\f\u201320\u2013\nwhich both carry charge 1/2 with respect to J3 = (\n\nP\n\nI\n\n\u221a\nH1I )/ 2. Obvious expressions, with\n\nsigns flipped, hold for the conjugate fields \u03a8\u2212\u2212 and \u03a8\u2212+ . The index I = 1, . . . , N refers to\nthe I-th field copy. As for the twist field in the Zn twisted sector, it carries charge (n \u2212 1)/2\nwith respect to J3 and therefore its H1 dependence is given by\nP\n(n \u2212 1) H1I\n\u221a\nexp(i\n),\n2n\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhereas it does not depend on H2 . The total dimension of the twist field is given by\nthe sum of the dimension of the charged component, (n \u2212 1)2 /4n, and the dimension of\nthe neutral one, (n2 \u2212 1)/4n, which gives a total of (n \u2212 1)/2, in agreement with its chiral\nprimary nature. Similar expressions hold for the right-moving fields.\nLet us consider first the three point function C1 . It is convenient to perform the calculation on the covering t-plane, where it is easy to find the following expression:\nI\nI\nk\nkn\nk\n1\nC1 =\ndt2 dt1\n(t2 )\u2212 n+1 (t2 \u2212 t0 )\u2212 n+1 (t1 )k (t1 \u2212 t0 ) n\nn\u22121\n(n + 1)x\n\u221e\n0\nt2\n1\n( )n\u22121\n,\nt1\n(t2 \u2212 t1 )(t1 \u2212 x)3\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere the contour integrations with the corresponding k-dependent powers project on the\ngiven fractional modes. The latter t2 and t1 dependent factors are, in terms of the z\nk\n\u2212 n+1\n\ncoordinate, just z2\n\nk\n\nand z1n respectively. It is convenient to rescale t1 and t2 by x,\n\nafter which we will get, for n large, an overall factor 1/xn+1 in (4.16), together with the\nreplacement of t0 by n/(n + 1), which is equal to 1 in the large n limit. The prefactor\n1/xn+1 was to be expected on dimensional grounds, since it gives a simple pole in the\nphysical coordinate u, in view of the relation (4.12), which gives also an additional factor\n1/n in the correlator. It remains to evaluate the contour integrals in (4.16), which is\nmost easily done by doing a series expansion of the integrand. More details are given in\nAppendix A, but is easy to see that the leading contribution is of order kn for n large. To\nestimate the overall behavior of the complete correlator, including \"spectator\" generators,\n\u221a\none should take into account that each generator comes with a normalization factor 1/ n,\n\n\f\u201321\u2013\nas already mentioned, so that the contribution of the diagonal contractions is of order\n1. Furthermore, by doing the relevant combinatorics, one can show that the three point\nfunction of normalized ground states < n + 1|\u03c3 1 , 1 |n > goes like n for large n. So, collecting\n2 2\n\nall the factors of n, we see that the full three point function behaves like k/n for large n.\nThe above result could have been obtained perhaps more transparently by using a\nsuperconformal Ward identity which relates C1 to the correlator\nC1\u2032 =< n + 1|J\u2212+\n\nk\nn+1\n\n\u03c3 1 , 1 (u, \u016b)J\u2212\u2212 k |n > .\n2 2\n\n(4.17)\n\nn\n\nThe Ward identity is obtained by rewriting G\u2212\napplied to J \u2212\n|n > in C1 as G+\nk |n >\n\u22121\n\u22121+k\n2\n\n2\n\nn\n\nn\n\nand doing the contour deformation we used previously. The only contribution arises when\nhits \u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b), which gives L\u22121 \u03c3 1 , 1 (u, \u016b). So we get as a result of these manipulations\nG+\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nthat C1 (u) = \u2202u C1\u2032 (u). On the other hand, on dimensional grounds, the u dependence of C1\u2032\nk\n\nis u n(n+1) , so that the u derivative produces a suppression factor 1/n2 . The n dependence\nof C1\u2032 itself is quickly estimated in the following way: to the leading order in 1/n the\nfractional modes of J + and J \u2212 are opposite to each other, so that when we bring say J +\nagainst J \u2212 |n > we get J03 |n >, that is a factor proportional to n. Taking into account the\nnormalization of the currents, we see that C1\u2032 is of order 1. Therefore again we see that C1\nis indeed of order 1/n in agreement with the previous analysis, if we take into account the\nnormalization of the three twist field correlator which goes like n.\nLet us come now to the other basic correlator C2 : again using SCFT Ward identities\nwe can relate it to C1 plus another correlator. This is done by writing\n+\nL\u22121+ k |n >= (G+\nG\u2212\n\u22121 \u22121+k\nn\n\n2\n\n2\n\nn\n\nk 3\nJ\nk )|n > .\nn \u22121+ n\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe first term in (4.18) can be shown, after bringing G+ against the other operators, to be\nequal to:\nC1 + < n + 1|G+1 \u2212\n2\n\nk\nn+1\n\n\u2202u \u03c3 1 , 1 (u, \u016b)G\u2212\n|n > ,\n\u22121+k\n2 2\n\n2\n\nn\n\n(4.19)\n\n\f\u201322\u2013\nacts on < n + 1|G+1 \u2212\nwhere C1 arises when G+\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\nk\nn+1\n\nand the second term when we commute\n\nG+ with \u03c31, 1 .\n2\n\nThe term involving J 3 in (4.18) can be shown explicitly, using the procedure explained\nin Appendix A, to be suppressed by a power of n with respect to C1 . We are left therefore\nwith the second term in (4.19). It is easy to see that this term is suppressed too in the\nlarge n limit compared to C1 : the reason is that all the n countings go in the same way\nas for the J + , J \u2212 correlator of the previous paragraph, but there is an additional 1/n\nsuppression factor coming from the jacobians appearing when relating the t coordinates to\nthe z coordinates. They are there in this case (as well as in (4.16), giving the prefactor\n1/(n + 1)) because the supercurrents which are being contour integrated have weight 3/2,\nwhereas they are absent in the case of the two currents J + and J \u2212 , which have weight 1,\nand therefore their contour integral is invariant under coordinate changes. Morew details\nare given in appendix A.\nLet us discuss now amplitudes which involve a change in the cohomology's degree, and\nshow, as anticipated before, that they do not occur in the present situation. To this purpose\nit is sufficient to consider the right moving sector of the amplitude:\n\u03a8\u0303+\u2212 |n > ,\n< n + 1|G\u0303\u22121 \u03c31,1 \u03a8\u0303++\n\u22121 \u22121\n2\n\n2\n\n(4.20)\n\n2\n\nOne can rewrite this correlator in the following way:\n< n + 1|\n\nI\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\n\ndz3 z3 G\u0303 (z3 )\n\nI\n\nu\n\n\u2212\n\ndz G\u0303 (z)\u03c31, 1 (u)\n2\n\nI\n\n0\n\ndz1 ++\n\u03a8\u0303 (z1 )\nz1\n\nI\n\n0\n\ndz2 +\u2212\n\u03a8\u0303 (z2 )|n > . (4.21)\nz2\n\nThis expression is computed using the t coordinates, using the map zi = tni (ti \u2212 t0 ) and\nkeeping track of the variuos jacobians as explained already. One can perform then first\nthe t, t1 and t2 contour integrations, but then one finds that the final t3 contour integral\nH\nvanishes, being of the form \u221e dt3 (t3 \u2212 t0 )/(t3 \u2212 x)3 .\nWe can now use the above results to compute, to the first non-trivial order, the change\n\nin the right-moving conformal dimensions of the left-excited states under discussion. The\n\n\f\u201323\u2013\nstarting point is the asnti-commutation relation:\n{G\u0303\u2212\n, G\u0303+\n} = L\u03030 \u2212 J \u030303 ,\n+1\n\u22121\n2\n\n(4.22)\n\n2\n\n(0)\u00b1\n\nis actually G\u0303\u00b1 1 + \u03b4 G\u0303\u00b1\n, with G\u0303(0)\u00b1 the zeroth order supercharge.\nHere G\u0303\u00b1\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nWe can take now the matrix element of (4.22) between any of the (normalized) excited\nstates proportional J\u2212\u2212 k |n >, G\u2212\n|n > or L\u22121+ k |n > and its conjugate. Notice that these\n\u22121+k\nn\n\n2\n\nn\n\nn\n\nstates are related to each other by supersymmetry. Consider for example |\u03c8n >\u223c J\u2212\u2212 k |n >.\nn\n\nFrom equation (4.10) we have:\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|\u03c8n\u22121\n>< \u03c8n\u22121\n|\u03b4 G\u0303\u2212\n|\u03c8n >= \u03bb2 |cn\u22121,n |2\n\u03b4 L\u03030 \u2212 j\u0303 =< \u03c8n |\u03b4 G\u0303+\n+1\n\u22121\n2\n\n(4.23)\n\n2\n\nHere we have used the fact that the zeroth order G\u0303(0) +\u2212 1 annihilates |\u03c8n >, so that there\n2\n\nis no need to consider the second order change in\nZn\u22121 twisted sector, is proportional to G\u2212\n\u22121+\n2\n\nk\nn\u22121\n\n.\nG\u0303+\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2032\nThe excited state |\u03c8n\u22121\n>, from the\n\n|n \u2212 1 > . From (4.23), we see that indeed\n\nthe leading order change in the right-moving conformal dimensions for the above states is\nof order (k/n)2 for a given mode k. What remains to do is to fix its N dependence. Recall\nthat the external states, from the Zn twisted sector, are canonically normalized, however\nwe have to fix the normalization of the blowing up mode. If we assume that the coupling\nq\n5\nconstant \u03bb equals the effective 6-dimensional string coupling g6 = gs Q\n, where gs is the\nQ1\n\nstring coupling8 , and the Z2 chiral primary \u03c3 is actually obtained by summing over the\nP\ntwo-cycles (i,j), i.e. it is of the form \u03c3 = N\ni<j \u03c3ij , then the three point function above\n\u221a\n\u221a\nis of order N = Q1 Q5 , since the canonically normalized Z2 twist field is \u03c3/N and the\n\u221a\nthree-point function of canonically normalized twist fields goes like 1/ N . Collecting all\nthe factors we get a correction of the form\n\nk\n1\n(gs )2 (Q5 )2 ( )2\n2\nn\n8\n\nIndependent arguments supporting this identification have been given in [15].\n\n(4.24)\n\n\f\u201324\u2013\nfor \u2206 = L0 + L\u03040 , which is in agreement with the first order expansion of the pp-wave\nhamiltonian for massive oscillators, when translated into CFT units.\nWe now discuss another class of states, which should correspond to T 4 massless oscillator\nstates in the light-cone hamiltonian on the pp-wave. These are non-chiral on both left- and\nright-moving sectors, and are obtained by applying fractional modes of the U(1)4L \u00d7 U(1)4R\nsuper-current algebra, generated by the four free bosons and fermions, to the ground state\nin the Zn twisted sector. Level-matching requires that L0 \u2212 L\u03030 = 0 mod n. Neither of\nand G\u0303+\nannihilates these states, and to zeroth order\nthe unperturbed supercharges G+\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n\n2\n\nin the blowing up mode both L\u03030 \u2212 J \u030303 and L0 \u2212 J03 are of the form k/n, with k << n.\n\nThe question is what happens when we switch on the blowing up mode. In general their\nconformal dimensions will change, but in order for the change to agree with the pp-wave\nstring spectrum it should happen that, to any order in in the blowing up mode coupling\nconstant, the change should be proportional to k/n. In this case the effect of turning\non the blowing up mode will be to renormalize k/n by some finite amount depending on\nits coupling constant. We will not be able to prove this, but we will perform structure\nconstant calculations similar to those described previously, which will confirm the above\np\npicture, giving indeed structure constants of order k/n.\n\nBefore turning to the calculation of the relevant three point functions, let us fix the\n\ncorrect normalization of the fractionally moded bosonic and fermionic oscillators. We\nhave, using the covering coordinates t's, for the left-moving bosons:\n\n< n|\u1fb1 k \u03b1\u2212 k |n >=\nn\n\nn\n\nI\n\ndt1\n\n0\n\nt2\n1\ndt2 ( )k\n=k,\nt1 (t1 \u2212 t2 )2\n\u221e\n\nI\n\n(4.25)\n\nwhereas for the left-moving fermions:\n<\n\n\u2212\u00b1\nn|\u03a8+\u2213\nk\u03a8 1\nk |n\n1\n\u2212\n\u22122+n\n2 n\n\n>=\n\nI\n\n0\n\ndt\np1\nt\u20321\n\nI\n\nSimilar expressions hold for the right-movers.\n\n\u221e\n\n1\nt2 n\u22121 t2 k\ndt\np2\n( ) =n,\nt\u20322 (t1 \u2212 t2 ) tn1 t1\n\n(4.26)\n\n\f\u201325\u2013\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThus we should rescale each bosonic (fermionic) oscillator by 1/ k (1/ n) when constructing normalized excited states.\nThe arguments of the first part of this section concerning the modification of G+ , G\u0303+\nin the presence of the blowing up mode go through also for this class of states, the only\ndifference being that now there is a non-trivial zeroth-order action of G+ , G\u0303+ as well.\nIn particular, at first order in the perturbation, we should compute three-point functions\ninvolving external excited states and an insertion of \u03c31, 1 or \u03c3 1 ,1 . Let us consider the first\n2\n\n2\n\ncase. In order for the three point function to be non-vanishing, the two external states\nshould contain operators acting on Zn and Zn+1 ground states respectively , which, in the\nright-moving sector, are conjugate of each other whereas in the left-moving sector they\nare conjugate apart from a single flip due to the presence of \u03c31, 1 . R-charge conservation\n2\n\nthen requires in the left-moving sector there should be a flip from a bosonic oscillator to a\nfermionic oscillator carrying +1/2 R-charge. The basic correlators we need to consider are\ntherefore9 :\nD1 (u) = < n + 1|\u03a8+1 +\n\nk\nn+1\n\nD2 (u) = < n + 1|\u03a8+1 +\n\nk\nn+1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\u0303\n\nk\nn+1\n\n\u03a8\u0303+1 +\n2\n\n \u0303 \u2212 k |n > ,\n\u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b)\u03b1\u2212 k \u1fb1\n2\n\nk\nn+1\n\nn\n\nn\n\n\u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b)\u03b1\u2212 k \u03a8\u0303\u2212\n|n > ,\n\u22121\u2212k\n2\n\nn\n\n2\n\n(4.27)\n\nn\n\nThese correlators can be computed along the lines we followed to evaluate C1,2 . Let su first\nconnsider D1 : one starts from the correlator:\n \u0304 t\u03042 )\u03c3 1 (u, \u016b)\u2202X(t1 )\u2202 \u0304X\u0304(t\u03041 )|n > ,\n< n + 1|\u03a8+ (t2 )\u2202X(\n1,\n2\n\n(4.28)\nk\n\nand then projects onto the given modes by contour integrating with the factors z1n and\nk\n\u2212 n+1\n\nz2\n\nas before. It is easy to see that the resulting expression , when expressed in terms of\n\nthe physical coordinate u goes like k 2 /nu. Taking into account the normalization factors\n3\u221a\ndiscussed above, giving a factor 1/k 2 n and the three-ground state correlator, which goes\nq\nlike n, we see that the resulting structure constant d1n,n+1 in D1 \u223c d1n,n+1/u goes like nk .\n9\n\nWe omit here the \u00b1 index corresponding to the direction 2 in (4.14)\n\n\f\u201326\u2013\nOne can similarly evaluate d2n,n+1 in D2 , starting with\n< n + 1|\u03a8+ (t2 )\u2202 \u0304\u03a8\u0303+ (t\u03042 )\u03c31, 1 (u, \u016b)\u2202X(t1 )\u03a8\u2212 (t\u03041 )|n > ,\n2\n\n(4.29)\n\nand proceeds in the same way. In this case the correlator goes like k/u, so that taking into\n3\u221a\naccount the normalization factors, which give now 1/n 2 k, and usual factor of n from the\nq\n2\nground states correlator, gives for the structure constant dn,n+1 \u223c nk .\nIn this case, unlike in the previous case, the first order structure constants above do\n\nnot allow to compute the full change in the conformal dimensions, since the zeroth order\nsupercharges do not annihilate the states and we need also the second order expression.\nSo, what is required is really a full fledged four point function calculation. Nevertheless\nwe believe that the results above give a good indication that indeed the variations of the\nconformal dimensions at arbitrary orders in the blowing up mode are proportional to k/n.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\nIn the last section we saw that the first order correction to the dimension matches with\n\nthe prediction from the pp-wave side. Now we discuss the higher order corrections for the\nstates corresponding to the massive oscillators.\nThe relevant set of states are the excitations of the Zn twisted chiral-chiral state by\n\u2212\napplying fractional moded Jk/n\n, G\u2212\n\u22121/2+k/n and L\u22121+k/n operators. Let us start from the\n\nstate |\u03c8n >\u2261 Nn J\u2212\u2212 k |n > where Nn is the normalization constant so that |\u03c8n > has unit\nn\n\nnorm. This is not a physical state; there must be multiple insertions of fractional modes so\nthat the total level is an integer (or half integer for fermionic states). However we have seen\nin the first order analysis that in the large n limit, it is sufficient to consider the interaction\nof only one of the insertions, the remaining ones are spectators and contract diagonally.\n, n\u22121\n). Using methods given in the last section one can see\n(j, j\u0303) charge of |\u03c8n > is ( n\u22123\n2\n2\n\u2212\nthat G\u0303+\n\u22121/2 and G1/2 annihilates this state at least to the first order in the perturbation.\n\n\f\u201327\u2013\n+\nMoreover G\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c8n > is proportional to G\u22121/2 |\u03c8n\u22121 >. It seems natural to assume that to\n\nall orders in the perturbation, under the action of N = (4, 4) generators, the set of states\nunder consideration are mapped to each other (in large n limit). If this is so then the above\nfirst order results must be true to all orders. This is seen simply by taking into account\nthe left and right U(1) charges of the states.\nNow using the supersymmetry algebra we find that the norm square of the state\nG\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c8n > is\n2\n||G\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c8n > || = \u03b3 < \u03c8n |\u03c8n >\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = L\u03030 \u2212 j\u0303 eigenvalue of |\u03c8n >.\nOn the other hand, we have seen from the three point computation given in the last\nsection, that to the first order in perturbation:\n\u221a\n\u03bbk\nN\n\u2212b\nab\n< \u03c8n\u22121 |G\u2212a\n1/2 G\u03031/2 |\u03c8n >= \u01eb\n2n\n\n(5.2)\n\nIf we assume that this equation is true to all orders in \u03bb/n, then, using the fact that the\nnorm square of the state G+\n\u22121/2 |\u03c8n\u22121 > is L0 \u2212 j eigenvalue of |\u03c8n\u22121 > which is equal to\n\u03b3 + 1 (note that the correction to L0 and L\u03030 must be equal), we conclude that:\n1 \u03bb2 k 2 N\n\u03b3=\n\u03b3 + 1 4n2\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe solution to this equation is\n1\n\u03b3= (\n2\n\nr\n\n1+\n\n\u03bb2 k 2 N\n\u2212 1)\nn2\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u221a\nIdentifying n/\u03bb N with p+ and the fact that the correction to \u2206 is twice the correction\nto L\u03030 and hence 2\u03b3, we find complete agreement with the pp-wave spectrum.\nThis incidentally also proves the formula for G\u0303 given in (3.12). Indeed it follows that\n\u221a\n1\n\u03bbk N\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u221a\n|\u03c8n\u22121\n>\n(5.5)\nG\u03031/2 |\u03c8n >=\nn\n\u03b3+1\n\n\f\u201328\u2013\n\u2032\nwhere |\u03c8n\u22121\n>=\n\n\u221a 1 G+\n|\u03c8\n\u03b3+1 \u22121/2 n\u22121\n\n> has unit norm. Using the value of \u03b3 and the identifi-\n\ncation of p+ as above, we find that:\nG\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c8n >=\n\ns\n\n\u03c9 k \u2212 p+ \u2032\n|\u03c8n\u22121 >\np+\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhich is exactly the relevant term appearing in the expression of G\u0303 from the pp-wave side\nin (3.12) .\nThe exact correspondence with the pp-wave therefore rests on the validity of equation\n(5.2) to all orders. Since G\u2212\n1/2 annihilates |\u03c8n >, this is equivalent to the statement that\n\u2212b\n{G\u0303\u2212a\n1/2 G1/2 }|\u03c8n\n\nab\n\n>= \u01eb \u03bb\n\nZ\n\ndz\u2202z (zz\u0304 \u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 )|\u03c8n >\n2 2\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere the integration contour encircles the insertion of the state |\u03c8n >. This equation is\nthe analog of equation (3.11) appearing in the pp-wave string, provided the operator on the\nright-hand side is identified with P\u03c3 /p+ . The latter vanishes on the physical states though\nR\nnot on the individual oscillators. This is also the case with the operator dz\u2202z (zz\u0304\u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 )\n2 2\nP\nappearing above: physical states consisting of multiple insertions satisfying\nki = 0 have\ninteger (or half-integer for fermionic states) unperturbed dimensions and therefore are local\nwith respect to \u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 and thus are annihilated by this operator. This is not the case with\n2 2\n\nthe individual building blocks of such states. Indeed the individual operator insertion\ncarries fractional dimension k/n, while the outgoing state carries dimension k/(n \u2212 1). The\ndifference of the dimensions being of order k/n2 , gives rise to the OPE:\n(zz\u0304 \u03c3\u0304 1 , 1 (z, z\u0304)|\u03c8n >\u223c n.\n2 2\n\nk\nlog z|\u03c8n\u22121 >\nn2\n\n(5.8)\n\nresulting in equation (5.2). Here the first factor of n on the right hand side comes because\nthere are n channels by which \u03c3\u0304 can take Zn to Zn\u22121 twisted sector.\nAnalogous discussion for the states corresponding to the massless pp-wave modes is\n\u2212\n+\nmore complicated. Consider the state |\u03c6n >\u223c \u03c81/2\u2212k/n\n\u03c8\u0303\u22121/2\u2212k/n\n|n > for k > 0. Under the\n\nassumption that the set of states corresponding to all the massless pp-wave modes close\n\n\f\u201329\u2013\n+\nunder the action of the symmetry algebra, we can again conclude that G\u2212\n1/2 and G\u0303\u22121/2\n+\nannihilates this state. If we further assume that G\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c6n > is proportional to G\u22121/2 |\u03c6n\u22121 >\n\u221a\nthen a discussion similar to above using the eq(5.2) would now imply that \u03b3 2 = \u03bb N k/n\n\nin agreement with the pp-wave prediction. However the problem is that there are two\ndifferent states having the same left and right U(1) charges as those of G\u0303\u2212\n1/2 |\u03c6n > and\nG+\n\u22121/2 |\u03c6n\u22121 >. Therefore the consideration of charges is not sufficient to conclude that the\nlatter two states are proportional to each other.\nWe conclude by noting that the issue of higher order corrections is an important open\nquestion. The discussion we have given above indicates that the crucial identity that one\nneeds to prove is equation (5.2). This equation suggests that there is an extension of the\nN = (4, 4) algebra which collapses to the usual one on the physical states. This is certainly\nthe case on the pp-wave side and to the first order in the perturbation also in the boundary\nCFT. It is also interesting to note that equation (5.2) plays the role of the equation of\nmotion used in [23] to derive an all order formula for the anomalous dimensions in the\nN = 4 Yang-Mills theory.\n\nAppendix\nIn this appendix we give some details of the computation of the correlation functions\nin section... The main object we have analyzed is the three point function denoted by C1 ,\nwhich is given by:\nC1 =\n\nI\n\n\u221e\n\ndt2\n\nI\n\nk\n\nk\n\ndt1 (z2 (t2 ))\u2212 n+1 (z1 (t1 )) n\n\n0\n+\n\n< n + 1|J (t2 )\n\nI\n\nx\n\np\n\nt\u20321\n\n\u221a\ndt t\u2032 G\u2212 (t)\u03c3 1 , 1 (x, x\u0304)G\u2212 (t1 )|n >,\n2 2\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere the prime on t (t1 ) means that it is differentiated with respect to z (z1 ), giving:\nt\u2032 =\n\n1\n,\ntn\u22121 (t \u2212 x)(n + 1)\n\n(A.2)\n\n\f\u201330\u2013\nwith similar expression for t1 , with x = nt0 /(n+1). As explained before, the presence of the\nsquare roots for the contour integrations of the supercurrents is due to the fact that they\nhave dimension 3/2. Using the scalar correlator (4.13) and the bosonization expressions\n(4.14) and (4.15) one can easily reproduce (4.16). After rescaling t1 and t2 by x one is left,\nin the limit of large n, with the integral:\n\n1\nC1 = 2\n(n )u\n\nI\n\n\u221e\n\ndt2\n\nI\n\ndt1\n0\n\nkn\n\nk\n\nk\n\n(t2 )\u2212 n+1 (t2 \u2212 1)\u2212 n+1 (t1 )k (t1 \u2212 1) n\nt2\n1\n( )n\u22121\n,\nt1\n(t2 \u2212 t1 )(t1 \u2212 1)3\n\n(A.3)\n\nIt is convenient to perform first the t2 integral and then the t1 integral, after expanding the\nintegrand in power series. In this way one gets:\nn+k\u22121\n1 X\nc(k/n)j c(\u2212k/n \u2212 3)(j\u22121) ,\nC1 = 2\nn u j=1\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere the coefficients c(\u03b1)i are defined to be:\nc(\u03b1)i =\n\n\u0393(i \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u0393(\u2212\u03b1)\u0393(i + 1)\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhich, for small \u03b1 behave like c(\u03b1)i \u2192 \u2212\u03b1/i, for i 6= 0, whereas c(\u03b1)0 = 1. Using the above\ndefinition of the ci 's, in particular the fact that, since j > 0, c(k/n)j goes like \u22121/kn, one\nsees that the above sum for large n is proportional to:\nn\nX\n1\nk\nj(j + 1) \u223c nk .\nnj\n2\nj=1\n\n(A.6)\n\nWe thus see that the structure constant cn,n+1 is of order k/n.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project is supported in part by EEC under TMR contracts HPRN-CT-2000-00148,\nHPRN-CT-2000-00122.\n\n\f\u201331\u2013\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
