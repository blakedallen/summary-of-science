FRIESE FOR THE NA49 COLLABORATION\nFachbereich Physik der Universit\u00e4t Marburg\nRenthof 5, 35032 Marburg, Germany\nE-mail: volker.friese@physik.uni-marburg.de\nWe present recent results of the SPS experiment NA49 on production of strange\nparticles and event-by-event fluctuations of mean pt and of charged particle ratios\nin central Pb+Pb collisions at various beam energies (40, 80, 158 AGeV) as well\nas in different collisions at 158 AGeV, going from p+p over light-ion collisions to\nperipheral and central Pb+Pb.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA possible interpretation of the data collected by the various heavy-ion experiments at the CERN-SPS over the past few years is that a deconfined\nstate of nuclear matter is already reached in central Pb+Pb collisions at top\nSPS energy (158 AGeV)1 . This immediately triggers the question whether\nthe transition point can be experimentally pinned down by varying the collision energy or the size of the collision system. The experiment NA492 aims\nto investigate this question by studying hadronic observables, predominantly\nstrangeness production, for different beam energies (40, 80 and 158 AGeV)\nas well as for different colliding systems, such as p+p, C+C and Pb+Pb at\nvarious centralities. Further data taking at even lower beam energies (20, 30\nAGeV) is foreseen for the year 2002.\n2\n2.1\n\nEnergy Dependence of Hadronic Observables\nKaon and \u039b Production\n\nNA49 can identify charged kaons by time-of-flight measurement near midrapidity and by the specific energy loss at forward rapidities. \u039b baryons are\nidentified in NA49 by their V0 decay topology. The mt spectra for both\nparticles types are well described by exponentials. For the kaons, we find\ncomparable slopes (220-240 MeV) for all three energies, the slopes for K \u2212\nbeing slightly lower than those of K + . In the case of \u039b, the slopes increase\nslightly with beam energy.\nThe rapidity distributions for kaons are shown in fig. 1a for 40 AGeV. We\nobserve the K + to have a somewhat broader distribution than the K \u2212 , which\nalso holds for the other energies.

For the latter case, the shape of the distribution at large |y| is not\nyet determined, leaving some uncertainty to the 4\u03c0 extrapolation. \u221a\nFig. 1b shows the K/\u03c0 ratio at midrapidity as a function of s. For\n80 AGeV, the analysis of pion production is not yet finished, so we restrict\nourselves to the data at 40 and 158 AGeV. While a continuous rise in K \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212\nfrom AGS3 over SPS to RHIC energies is observed, the K + /\u03c0 + ratio seems\nto reach a maximum at or slightly above top AGS energy. This behaviour is\nmore pronounced in the case of \u039b (fig. 2).\nThe K/\u03c0 ratios in full phase space are shown in fig. 3. In contrast to\nK \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212 , the K + /\u03c0 + ratio clearly shows a non-monotonic behaviour. Most\nmodels, including hadron gas models as well as microscopic transport models,\nfail to reproduce such a trend.

As a measure of these fluctuations, we have determined\nD\u0303 = hNch ih\u03b4R2 i/(C\u03bc Cy ), where h\u03b4R2 i denotes the fluctuations in the ratio\nof the numbers of positively and negatively charged hadrons, as a function\nof the rapidity window \u2206y. We obtain similar values around 4 for all three\nbeam energies, corresponding to the expectation for an uncorrelated pion gas,\nwhereas a QGP was predicted to yield values between 1 and 2. However, the\ncorrection factors C\u03bc and Cy , which account for the finite net charge within\nthe acceptance and global charge conservation7 , are still under debate; hence\nat the moment we do not draw a definite conclusion from the data observed.\n3\n\nSystem Size Dependence of Hadronic Observables\n\n3.1\n\nKaon and \u03c6 Production\n\n<K> / <\u03c0>\n\n0.25\n0.225\n0.2\n0.175\n0.15\n0.125\n0.1\n0.075\n0.05\n0.025\n0\n\nAGS\n\n40\n\nSPS\n\n158\n\n+\n\n+\n\nK /\u03c0\n\n\u03a6pt [MeV]\n\nThe \u03c6 meson is measured in NA498 via the invariant mass of its decay products\nK + K \u2212 . When comparing the \u03c6/\u03c0 ratio in central collisions of light ions\nto that in peripheral collisions of heavy nuclei, we find that the number of\nparticipants may not be the right variable to characterise the reaction, because\nit does not take into account the collision geometry9 . When using the variable\nR \u2212 b/2, with R being the nuclear radius and b the impact parameter of the\ncollision, we find a smooth evolution in \u03c6 enhancement when going from p+p\nover C+C to peripheral and central Pb+Pb.

Fig. 4 gives the result as\na function of Npart for two different rapidity windows. At forward rapidity,\nwe obtain very small values of \u03a6pt , almost indepent of Npart . Around midrapidity, however, we observe a rise in \u03a6pt up to Npart \u2248 100, from where it\nstays constant up to central Pb+Pb. This is contrary to the expectations,\nwhich suggest a decrease in \u03a6pt when going from elementary collisions to\nlarger systems where increasing equlibration suppresses the fluctuations. An\ninterpretation of this findings is still lacking.\nReferences\n1. R. Stock, Phys. Lett. B 456, 277 (1999)\n2. S. V. Afanfasiev et al, Nucl. Instrum. Methods A 430, 210 (1999)\n3. L.
