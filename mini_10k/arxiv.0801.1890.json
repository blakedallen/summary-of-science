Topological defects are also real objects in low energy physics of the\ncondensed matter. Some well-known examples are flux tubes in superconductors\nand vortices in superfluid helium-4 [3].\nThere are two forms of classifying cosmic strings:\nhR the first\ni one uses the\n\u03b8\nWilson-line integral at infinite radius U (\u03b8) = P exp 0 A.dl , where P represents the path ordering of the exponential. This generates the condensate\nwinding at spatial infinity h\u03c6 (\u03b8)i = U (\u03b8) h\u03c6 (0)i, where h\u03c6i is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field producing the breaking G h\u03c6i H.

Martins Sim\u00f5es)\n\n\u2020 Corresponding\n\n1\n\n\fcase for U (2\u03c0) = h \u2208 H, being H the little group of the Higgs field h\u03c6 (0)i.\nThus, the cosmic strings that can be formed in this breaking are specified by\nthe possible values of U (2\u03c0) \u2212 the elements of H. The other form of classifying\ncosmic strings is to specify the topological class of a string, such that the vacuum\nmanifold G/H has a nontrivial fundamental group, i.e., the elements of the first\nhomotopy group \u03c01 (G/H) are nontrivial. In general, m\u2212dimensional defects\nin a d\u2212dimensional medium are classified by the homotopy group \u03c0n (G/H)\nwhere[4] n = d \u2212 m \u2212 1, such that, when n = 0, 1, 2 the objects formed are\ndomain walls, cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles, respectively.\nA cosmic strings model based in the product group SO(10) \u2297 SO(10) \u0301 \u2282\nSO(20) GUT with SO(10) being the symmetry of ordinary matter and SO(10) \u0301\ndescribing the mirror matter was constructed by Schwarz [5]. This kind of\nobjects have the extraordinary property of transforming an ordinary particle\nin a mirror particle when this particle gives a turn around the string. This\ntype of cosmic strings are considered as an Alice string [6]. A model of mirror\ncosmic strings as possible sources of ultrahigh energy neutrinos was constructed\nby Berezinsky et al.[7]. Some models of left-right cosmic strings [8][9] as well\nas B \u2212 L cosmic strings also exists in the literature [10]. Although explicit\nsupersymmetric models of cosmic strings have been built [11], explicit models\nof cosmic strings in SU (N > 5) GUT \u0301s with mirror matter have not been\nconsidered in the literature. Some of the difficulties of this class of models\nwere to reproduce the well-known phenomenology of low energy. But it is also\npossible that this kind of objects have been formed in the TeV scale or in the\nelectro-weak scale, with the possibility of having experimentally sizeable effects.\nThe connection between left-right symmetric models and cosmic strings is\nvery appealing but finds a fundamental phenomenological difficulty: the Higgs\nsector that breaks the parity symmetry has a large number of unknown fundamental parameters and we have no direct connection with the cosmic strings\nscales.\nRecently we have studied [14, 15] a new mirror left-right symmetric model.\nIn this model we have shown that SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L can be broken\nto the standard model group with a Higgs sector containing only two doublets\nand two singlets. In this model parity is broken by the D\u2212 parity mechanism\nand an SU (7) GUT model is proposed.\nIn the present paper we have constructed a cosmic strings model of the type\nZ2 , and have called it a D\u2212 parity cosmic strings, based in a SU (7) GUT with\na especial embedding in order to incorporate the minimal left-right symmetry\nas a subgroup and include mirror matter. A careful election of the Higgs fields\nis necessary to get the topological stability of this cosmic strings until our days.\nWe have also the possibility of B \u2212 L cosmic strings in our model, but\nthe presence of SU (2)R would desestabilize them [8]. This type of strings are\nproduced when a factor U (1)B\u2212L (that contain a Z2 discrete symmetry which\ncan be left unbroken down to low energies) is broken by a Higgs scalar in a\ncomplex representation of G.\nThe P \u2212parity spontaneously breaking will happen with the break of the leftright components in the low energy stage governed by the symmetry SU (3)C \u2297\n2\n\n\fSU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L [12][13][14].\nOur paper is organized as follow: after making some general comments in\nthe introduction, in the section 2 we analyze the breakdown of SU (7) and the\nconsequent appearance in our model of D\u2212 parity cosmic strings. In section 3\nwe present the question of magnetic monopoles in the phase transitions. The\nmechanism of generation of superconducting currents with neutrino mirrors as\nwell as the flavor changing between ordinary and mirror neutrinos is approached\nin section 4. In section 5, final comments and conclusions are provided.\n\n2\n\nBreakdown of SU(7) and D\u2212 parity cosmic\nstrings\n\nThe spontaneous breaking of SU (N ) gauge theories usually can be made through\nthe fundamental representation N or with multiplets corresponding to the direct product (N2 \u22121) \u2297 (N2 \u22121). However, to find Higgs multiplets producing\nZ2 cosmic strings in a semisimple gauge group G it is necessary to observe that\nthe chiral fermions must be placed in a irreducible fundamental representation.\nThen it is necessary to look for the product N \u2297 N for the symmetrical component of higher weight giving masses to the fermions[21]. This is the habitual\nprocedure for G = SO(10), E6 , E7 , E8 . Nevertheless, in SU (N ) grand unified\ngauge theories the chiral fermions are placed in combinations of representations\nin such a way that they eliminate the anomalies. For SU (7), our election, free\n\u2217\nof anomalies, is {7} \u2295 {21 } \u2295 {35}.\nAn interesting class of cosmic strings arises from the following breaking chain\nof SU (7)\nSU (7) SM SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 Z2 SD\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L \u2297 Z2 \u03c7R\n\u2212\u2192\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y \u2297 Z2 \u03c7L SU (3)C \u2297 U (1)e.m \u2297 Z2 .\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n(1)\n\nThe matter content is included in the decomposition of the representations of\nthe symmetry breaking Higgs fields and the fundamental fermions multiplet\nunder the SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)X maximal subgroup1 of SU (7):\n\u2217\n\n{63} = {7} \u2295 {21 } \u2295 {35},\n\u2217\n\u2217\n{21 } = [1, 1,10] \u2295 [5\u2217 , 2, 3] \u2295 [10 , 1, \u22124],\n{48} = [24, 1,0] \u2295 ...\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere we have indicated only those pieces that acquire vacuum expectation\n\u2217\nvalues for {21 } and {48}.\n1 Our notation is: { } for SU (7), [ ] for the components under SU (5) \u2297 SU (2) \u2297 U (1)\nR\nX\nand ( ) for SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L decompositions. It should be noticed\nthat {63} it is not an irreducible representation of SU (7).\n\n3\n\n\fOur election for the Higgs multiplets is SM \u223c {21\u2217 } \u2295 {1} \u2283 [1, 1,10] \u2295\n[1, 1,0], i.e., SM is some linear combination of Higgs fields in the {21\u2217 } and\n{1} representations along with their coupling strengths. The first component\nSM (21) \u223c {21\u2217 } \u2283 [1, 1,10] \u223c (1, 1, 1,0) it should be responsible for producing\ncosmic strings. We clarify our election of the Higgs field breaking SU (7). In reality, from the product of the fundamental representations {7} \u2297 {7} = {21}A \u2295\n{28}S we can see that {28} = [15, 1,4] \u2295 [5, 2, \u2212 3] \u2295 [1, 3, \u2212 10] doesn't contain any component that can break SU (7) leaving invariant SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R in\nthe next stage, as it is our desire. A different situation happens for {21}A that\ncontain the appropriate piece [1, 1, \u221210] in order to construct cosmic strings Z2\nwith the surprising property of changing flavors of ordinary and mirrors neutrinos. However, as it was observed in reference [25], in unified theories it is also\npossible to generate fermion masses using antisymmetric representations. Although in our model neutrinos don't receive masses at the tree level from {21}A\nat the GUT scale, it is vital to generate radiative neutrino masses [15]. For this\nreason, we have done the election of antisymmetric components of N \u2297 N that\nwould also produce different types of cosmic strings Z2 .\nThe second term SM (1) \u223c {1} \u2283 [1, 1,0] could generate superheavy mass to\nsome neutrinos as well as driving the inflation scenario, as we will see below.\nThe following decompositions are necessary\n{35} = [10\u2217 , 1,6] \u2295 [5, 1, \u2212 8] \u2295 [10, 2, \u2212 1],\n{48} = [1, 1,0]\u2295[1, 3, 0] \u2295 [24, 1,0] \u2295 [5, 2,7] \u2295 [5\u2217 , 2, \u22127] ,\n\u2217\n\n{224} = [40, 1,4] \u2295 [24, 1, \u2212 10] \u2295 [45, 2, \u2212 3] \u2295 [10 , 2,11] \u2295 [5, 2, \u2212 3]\n\u2295[10, 1,4] \u2295 [10, 3,4],\n(5)\nThe next important fields are SD \u223c {48} \u2283 [24, 1,0] \u2283 (1, 1, 1,0), \u03c7R \u223c {35} \u2283\n[10, 2, \u22121] \u2283 (1, 1, 2,1) and also \u03c7L \u223c {224} \u2283 [10, 1, \u22124] \u2283 (1, 2, 1, 1) which\nare invariant under 2\u03c0 rotations because they are not spinorial representations.\nThe fermions content is deployed [15] in the representations {1}, {7}, {21}\n\u2217\nand {35} with the anomaly free combinations {1} \u2295 {7} \u2295 {21 } \u2295 {35}. These\nselected Higgs multiplets can give masses to all the fermions as it can be directly\nverified from the tensorial products [16]:\n\u2217\n\n{7 } \u2297 {7} = {1} \u2295 {48},\n\n{7} \u2297 {7} = {21}A \u2295{28}S ,\n{7} \u2297 {35} = {35\u2217 } \u2295 {210},\n\u2217\n\n{7 } \u2297 {35} = {224} \u2295 {21},\n\u2217\n{21} \u2297 {35} = {224} \u2295 {21 } \u2295 ...,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2217\n\n{21 } \u2297 {21} = {1} \u2295 {48} \u2295 ...,\n{21} \u2297 {21} = ({196} \u2295 {35})S \u2295{210}A ,\n\u2217\n\n{35 } \u2297 {35} = {1} \u2295 {48} \u2295 ...\n\nThe remaining particles that didn't obtain their masses at the tree level, will\nobtain their masses from radioactive corrections.\n4\n\n\fThe Z2 symmetry that appears in (1) is the discrete remanent of a broken\nU (1)X , which can be identified as D\u2212 parity symmetry [13] as is evident from\nthe next stage of symmetry breaking.\nNow we pass to describe the breaking chain (1). If one begins with a simply\nconnected gauge group G, strings will not arise in a phase transition in which G is\nspontaneously broken. This is the case for SU (7) as in any GUT based in SU (N )\nor Spin(N ); strings will not arise at the first stage of symmetry breaking [17].\nThen, the breakdown of SU (7) to its maximal sub-group SU (5)\u2297SU (2)\u2297U (1)X\nwill not produce strings. The previous SU (2) factor is assumed to be the right\nsector, i.e. we assume SU (2)R . This is possible because the generators of\nSU (2)R are included in SO(14) and SU (7) is naturally embedded in SO(14).\nHowever, SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R is connected and by virtue of a well-known property of the homotopy groups[4] \u03c0i\u22121 SU (n) = \u03c0i+1 SU (n), i 6 2m 6 n. So we\nhave \u03c00 (SU (5)) = 0 and \u03c00 (SU (2)) = 0, and then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nSU (7)\n\u03c01\n= \u03c00 (SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 Z2 ) = Z2 .\n(7)\nSU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 Z2\nThe kind cosmic strings formed in this stage of breaking symmetry has energy\n2\nper unit length \u223c hSM (21)i and could be called D\u2212parity cosmic strings for\narguments that we will be giving soon. According to the products given in (6),\nthe following relevant couplings conserving the U (1)X charge are possible:\n\u2217\ng\n{21 } \u2297 {1} \u2297 {21H } \u2283 \u03bdeR NEL S\nM (21) ,\n\u2217\n\nC N\n{1} \u2297 {1} \u2297 {1H } \u223c NEL\nEL SM (1) ,\n\nC \u03bd\nC\n{7 } \u2297 {7} \u2297 {1}H \u2283 \u03bd\u03bcR\n\u03bcR SM (1) , NML NML SM (1) ,\n\n{7} \u2297 {7} \u2297\n\n{21\u2217H }\n\n(8)\n\n\u2283 \u03bd\u03bcR NML SM (21)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nSimilar couplings arise for the multiplets in 64\u2217 = {1} \u2295 {7 } \u2295 {21} \u2295 {35 },\nwhere we can accommodate the lepton \u03c4 family, a new fourth family of \"ordi\u0012 \u0013C\n\u0012 \u0013C\n\u03bd\u03b8L\noL\n\u2217\n\u2217\nC\nC\nnary\" leptons l\u03b8L =\n\u2282 {7 }, its quarks qL =\n\u2282 {35} and its\n\u03b8L\naL\nrespective mirror partners [15].\nIn the following stage for the breaking chain (1) it is possible that B \u2212 L\ncosmic strings could be formed since\n\u0013\n\u0012\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L\n= Z2 .\n(9)\n\u03c01\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y\nThus, as Z2 it is not already contained in a continuous connected invariance\ngroup SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y of the vacuum, B \u2212 L cosmic strings of energy\n2\nper unit length \u223c h\u03c7R i can appear in this stage. However, it was showed in [8]\nthat this Z2 as expected from the breakdown of U (1)B\u2212L group, by itself does\nnot persist due to the presence of the SU (2)R . Thus, the B \u2212 L cosmic strings\nappearing in this stage will be unstable and decaying quickly. In the phenomenological context, it is also important to notice that P\u2212 parity is spontaneously\n5\n\n\fbroken along with the group SU (2)R . Some low energy phenomenologic aspects\nof SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L with mirror matter were studied in\n[15][18].\n\n3\n\nMonopoles in the phase transitions\n\nIn this section we look for the formation of other topological defects, such as\nmonopoles, in the breaking chain (1). As it was recognized in the literature, the\nsymmetry of matter parity Z2 is important in order to preserve large values for\nthe proton lifetime, and also because it guarantees the topological stability of\ncosmic strings. Let us use\u0010the Kibble mechanism\n\u0011 [2] based in homotopy theory to\nSU(7)\nfind monopoles. Thus \u03c02 SU(5)\u2297SU(2)\n= \u03c01 (SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 Z2 ) = I\nR \u2297Z2\nis trivial. According to the Kibble mechanism [2] topological monopoles are not\nformed during the first phase transition in (1). Let us also notice the relations\n\u0012\n\u0013\nSU (7)\n\u03c02\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L \u2297 Z2\n= \u03c01 (SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L \u2297 Z2 ) = Z,\n\u03c02\n\n\u03c02\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nSU (7)\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y \u2297 Z2\n\n(10)\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u03c01 (SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y \u2297 Z2 ) = Z,\n\u0013\nSU (7)\n= \u03c01 (SU (3)C \u2297 U (1)e.m \u2297 Z2 ) = Z.\nSU (3)C \u2297 U (1)e.m \u2297 Z2\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThus, starting from the second phase transition in the breaking chain (1), topological magnetic monopoles were formed which will be topologically stable until\nlow energies. These objects, if they are present until our days, would be dangerous for the universe because they would dominate the energy density quickly.\nConsequently, it is necessary to appeal to inflation to dilute them. This is\npossible if the singlet SU (7), {1} is assumed to be the responsible to generate\nthe inflation scenario. We assume a coupling between SD \u223c {48} producing\nmonopoles, and {1} driving the inflation by means of a hybrid inflation potential, for example as given in [19]. This mechanism, together with the monopoleantimonopole pair nucleation could dilute necklaces cosmic strings [20] possibly\nformed in this phase transition. To avoid that cosmic strings are thrown away or\ndissociated as consequence of the inflation, we suppose some discrete symmetry\n\u2217\nto avoid a coupling between the {1H } \u223c SM (1) and the {21H } \u223c SM (21).\n\n4\n\nNeutrino effects in D\u2212 parity cosmic strings\n\ng\nWe begin with the first phase transition SU (7) S\nM SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 Z2 . The\n\u2212\u2192\ntype of cosmic strings taking place in this phase transition is Z2 [21]. The only\n6\n\n\fsupermassive fermions in this stage are NEL ; \u03bd\u03c4 R and it \u0301s mirror partner N\u03a5L\nand \u03bd\u03bcR with it \u0301s mirror partner NML . They obtain Majorana masses of order\n1016 GeV through the component {1H } \u223c SM (1).\n\u2217\ng\nA mixing of the type \u03bdeR NEL S\nM (21) \u2282 {21 } \u2297 {1} \u2297 {21H } has interesting effects. The cosmic strings solutions are given by the classical con(0)\n\u03bc\nclas\nfigurations SM\n(21) = f (r) ei\u03b8 SM (\u221e) and Aclas\n= 2a(r)\n\u03b8\ngr \u03b4\u03b8 ; where we are\nassuming Ethe winding number n = 1 and the vacuum expectation value is\nD\n\u221a\n(0)\nSM (\u221e) = \u03c5M / 2 [1]. Thus, in this case a supermassive mirror electron\nneutrino NEL coming closer from the space infinity to the anti-cosmic string,\nwhere a(r), f (r) \u2192 1, after giving a complete turn of 2\u03c0 around of the anticosmic string becomes in \u03bdeR . An analogous situation will be present between\n\u03bd\u03c4 R and their mirror partner N\u03a5L .\nThe formation of zero modes is also possible if we add the quantum fluctuations to the classical configurations of the Higgs and gauge fields of the string:\nclas\nclas\nd\nb\u03bc in an analogous way as to the\nSM (21) = SM\n(21) + S\n+A\nM (21), A\u03bc = A\u03bc\ncapture of an electron by a nucleus with the emission of a photon. In this sense,\nit is expected the capture of NEL by the anti-string and the subsequent formation of zero mode of \u03bdeR with the emission of the scalar Higgs or the vectorial\nboson A\u03bc that form the anti-string. The inverse process is also possible. If the\nnecessary kinematic considerations are allowed, we can have the capture of an\n\u03bdeR and the formation of neutral currents with the mirror electron neutrino NEL\nand the emission of bosons from the string. One should not forget that at this\nstage these currents are massless because in the string we have a(r), f (r) \u2192 0\nas r \u2192 0.\n\u2217\nA similar situation will take place through the coupling {7}\u2297{7} \u2297 {21H } \u2283\n\u03bd\u03bcR NML SM (21) where a mirror muon neutrino NML giving a complete turn\nof 2\u03c0 around of the cosmic string becomes a \u03bd\u03bcR with the possibility of forming\nmassless zero modes by means of the same mechanism as described before.\nThus, it is possible to generate superconducting currents with mirror neutrinos.\nSimilar ideas were placed by one of the authors in a model of superconducting\ncosmic strings SO(10) in order to explain UHECR [22]. Processes of flavor\nchanging neutral currents in cosmic strings and domain walls were also analyzed\nin [23]. The extraordinary consequence of our model is that in the presence of\nthis type of cosmic string, flavor changes of neutrinos would take place through\nNEL \u2194 \u03bdeR , N\u03a5L \u2194 \u03bd\u03c4 R , NML \u2194 \u03bd\u03bcR , N\u0398L \u2194 \u03bd\u03b8R . This is the reason why\nwe call these strings D\u2212 parity cosmic strings. It is also possible that this type\nof topological defects could hide mirror neutrinos until today in the form of\nmassless zero modes.\n\n5\n\nComments and conclusions\n\nWe have built a model of Z2 cosmic strings which we have called D\u2212 parity\ncosmic strings in virtue to their extraordinary property of changing flavor between ordinary neutrinos and mirrors neutrinos, in the GUT scale, when one of\n\n7\n\n\fthem gives a complete turn around the string. Our type of string is not an Alice\nstring in which a particle is transformed in its anti-particle. This extraordinary\nproperty of this type string is a consequence of the mixing between ordinary\nneutrinos and their mirror partners through the field of a Higgs particle in the\nstring and of the magnetic flow inside the string that makes a rotation of the\nfermion field approaching to it from very far.\nA more realistic model of D\u2212parity cosmic strings could arise from a breaking chain of the type\ne \u2297 Z2 \u2192 H \u2297 D \u2297 Z2 \u2192 SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)B\u2212L \u2297 Z2\nG\u2192H\n\u2192 SU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y \u2297 Z2 \u2192 SU (3)C \u2297 U (1)e.m \u2297 Z2 ,\n\n(13)\n\ne = SU (7) and H = SU (5) \u2297 SU (2)R . In reality, the first\nwhere G = SO(14), H\nphase transition it can be produced for an Higgs in2 1716S \u2282 64 \u2297 64 through\nof it \u0301s singlet component that leaves invariant the factor SU (7). The second\nphase transition could be produced for 91 \u2283 {1} \u2283 [1, 1,0] which is even under\nZ2 and the third phase transition by other 91 \u2283 {21} \u2283 [1, 1, \u2212 10] which is\nodd under D\u2212parity but is even under Z2 . Thus, the Left-Right hierarchy is\ninduced of natural way in our breaking chains (13). In the presence of mirror\nmatter this type of cosmic strings could have important effects [24].\nSuperheavy neutrinos mirror could also be the source of UHECR through\nthe mechanism of generation of superconducting currents described here. In\nthis context, if they were captured at the beginning of the friction period, an\nestimative of the vortons density indicates that it would be more relevant for\nUHECR in this period than in the scaling regime [22].\nAcknowledgment We thank Marco A.
