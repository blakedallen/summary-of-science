In particular, orthorhombic rare-earth\nmanganites RMnO3 represent an important class of \"improper ferroelectrics\" [1] where electric dipoles are induced by a frustrated magnetic ordering. Within this\nfamily of compounds, TbMnO3 and DyMnO3 , in their\nnoncollinear magnetic phases, have been experimentally\nshown to behave as multiferroics showing a weak polarization (P < 0.1\u03bcC/cm2 ) and a spin-flop ferroelectric\ntransition.[2] Moreover, it has been recently predicted\nthat relatively strong ferroelectricity occurs in the Etype antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of RMnO3 through\na model study where the double-exchange interaction between Mn-d orbitals is proposed as a driving force for\npolar atomic displacements.[3] In that case, the electric\npolarization P is not related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction, which is expected to generate much lower\nP .[4, 5, 6] Following the model study, our previously\nreported ab-initio calculations [7] have confirmed that\nAFM-E HoMnO3 indeed shows a high ferroelectric polarization (P \u223c 6\u03bcC/cm2 ); it was shown there that the\nAFM-E spin ordering, which breaks the space-inversion\nsymmetry, is such that ferroelectric dipoles arise even\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: silvia.picozzi@aquila.infn.it\n\nwithout atomic displacements.[7] From the experimental\npoint of view, ferroelectricity was detected in policrystalline ortho-HoMnO3,[8] the magnitude of polarization\nbeing however much smaller than what is theoretically\npredicted and showing a strong dependence on the magnetic field below the ordering temperature of the Ho, suggesting their involvement in the development of P . The\nreason behind the disagreement between theory [3, 7] and\nexperiments [8] is still under debate.\nThe microscopic origin of the multiferroism in orthoRMnO3 is tightly linked to the lattice degree of freedom:\na small ionic radius of the R atom holds a key role in affecting i) structural properties, such as both the JT distortion in the MnO2 plane and the GdFeO3 -like tilting of\nMnO6 octahedron, ii) spin configuration determined by\nMn-d super-exchange interaction Jij , iii) orbital ordering\nstabilized by Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion, and iv) hopping\nintegral in terms of double exchange interaction. Since\nthese aspects are all mutually combined, first we will discuss the case of AFM-E HoMnO3 , and we will explain,\nfrom a microscopic quantum-mechanical point of view,\nthe origin of the magnetically-induced ferroelectric polarization in terms of the spin, orbital and lattice degrees\nof freedom. The analysis based on Wannier functions\nrepresents a novel development with respect to our previous study on HoMnO3 .[7] Moreover, in the second part\nof the paper, we will discuss about structure, magnetism,\norbital ordering, hopping integrals and ferroelectricity as well as the links between them - along the manganites\nseries, with the main aim of identifying chemical trends\n\n\f2\nas a function of the R ion.\n\nII.\n\nSTRUCTURAL AND COMPUTATIONAL\nDETAILS\n\nThe unit cell in orthorhombic RMnO3 shows strong\ndistortions with respect to the ideal cubic perovskite.\nWhereas the P bnm setting is used in some other references, the standard P nma orientation is adopted in this\npaper, i.e. we choose b as the longest axis. Although\nthe hexagonal non-perovskite phase is more stable than\nthe orhorhombic phase in RMnO3 for R smaller than\nTb, the transition to the metastable orthorhombic phase\ncan be obtained by high-pressure synthesis.[9, 10, 11, 12]\nWe have considered five kinds of AFM configurations:\nAFM-A, C, G in 20 atoms/unit cell and AFM-E and\nAFM-E* in 40 atoms/unit cell. We recall that, according\nto the standard Wollan-Koehler notation[13], the AFMA shows FM (AFM) intraplanar (interplanar) coupling;\nthe AFM-C shows FM (AFM) interplanar (intraplanar)\ncoupling; the AFM-G shows AFM in both intra- and interplanar coupling. The AFM-E shows in-plane FM zigzag chains antiferromagnetically coupled to the neighboring chains; the interplanar coupling is also AFM (for the\nAFM-E spin arrangements in the MnO2 plane, we refer to\nthe following Fig. 2). We denote by AFM-E* the spinconfiguration showing the same in-plane spin arrangement as AFM-E, but with an interplanar FM coupling.\nNote that the AFM-A spin arrangement shows the spaceinversion as symmetry operation, at variance with the\nAFM-E spin-configuration which shows non centrosymmetric P mn21 symmetry.\nAs far as the electronic structure is concerned (especially for the density of states projected on the Mn atom\nas well as orbital-ordering, see below), it is useful to define - in addition to the \"global\" X, Y, Z orthorhombic\nframe - a \"local\" frame, specific to each Jahn-Teller-like\ndistorted MnO6 octahedron, obtained by choosing x, y, z\nalong the middle, short and long Mn-O axis, respectively.\nIn this local frame, the orbital ordered Mn-e1g state, which\nis often expressed as (3x2 \u2212 r2 )/(3y 2 \u2212 r2 ), is described as\n3z 2 \u2212r2 (denoted as z 2 hereafter for simplicity). The simulations were performed by using density-functional theory (DFT) and the Perdew-Becke-Erzenhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to\nthe exchange-correlation potential.[14] The calculations\nwere done with two program codes according to different\npurposes.\nThe expensive calculations for the structural optimization of the atomic structure and Berry phase\nfor the AFM-A and AFM-E phases were done with\n\"Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program code\",[15] where projector-augmented-wave (PAW)\npseudo-potential is used. The plane wave cutoff is set\nto 500 eV in energy. We used 8 special k-points (divided as 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4) in 1/8 irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ)\nfor the A-AFM phase and 4 special k-points (divided as\n\nFIG. 1: Energy bandstructure of optimized AFM-E HoMnO3 .\nDue to the AFM-E state, only the up-spin channel is plotted.\nEF denotes the Fermi energy and it is set as zero of the energy\nscale.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4) in 1/4 IBZ for the E-AFM phase according to\nthe Monkhorst-Pack scheme. The Berry phase was calculated by integrating over six k-point strings parallel to\nthe c axis, each string containing 6 k-points.\nCalculations requiring a higher precision (i.e. as\nfor the total energy differences for the stability of\ndifferent spin-configuration) and the construction of\nMaximally-localized Wannier functions (WFs) [16] were\ndone with the FLEUR code[17] which is based on the\nfull-potential linearized augmented planewave (FLAPW)\nformalism.[18] Muffin-tin radii were set to 2.5, 2.0 and\n1.5 a.u. for R, Mn and O atoms, respectively, where the\nwavefunction cutoff was chosen as 3.8 a.u.\u22121 . The potential was converged with 24 special k-points and density of states was calculated with 192 k-points within the\ntetrahedron method. For AFM-E and AFM-E\u2217 phase,\n12 k-points were used according to the doubled unit cell.\nThe Wannier function calculation, whose procedure was\nrecently implemented in the FLEUR code [19], was done\nwith 512 k-points (divided as 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8). R-5s and 5p\nstates were treated as local orbitals.\nThe localized R-4f electrons were assumed as core electrons: \"frozen core\" within the VASP code and \"open\ncore\" within the FLEUR code, [20] where the spin moment is maximized due to Hund's rule. Irrespective of\nthese approaches, the 4f states lie deep in energy (a few\neV below the Fermi energy) and they are almost completely undispersed, so that they do not affect other valence states.\n\n\f3\nIII. MICROSCOPIC ORIGIN OF THE\nFERROELECTRIC POLARIZATION IN HoMnO3\n\nLet us start our discussion by focusing on the case\nof AFM-E HoMnO3 , which was previously found by\nsome of us to show a large polarization along the inplane c-axis due to non-centrosymmetric collinear spinarrangement.[7] In this work, we perform a careful analysis in terms of Wannier functions which explains the\nmicroscopic mechanism at the basis of the final ferroelectricity. The structural parameters used in our calculations are summarized in a later section, together with\nthe parameters in other RMnO3 compounds (cfr Table\nIV A 1 below). The magnetically-induced spontaneous\npolarization was calculated by using i) the point charge\nmodel (PCM) where each ion has been given its nominal\ncharge (Ho:+3, Mn:3+, O:2-); ii) the Berry phase (BP)\nmethod implemented in the VASP code and iii) the Wannier function (WF) method implemented in the FLEUR\ncode.[21] We recall that, in the first approach only the positions of the anions and cations are considered, whereas\nin the two latter[23, 24] quantum-mechanical treatments,\nthe self-consistent electronic structure is fully taken into\naccount.\nTo calculate the polarization within BP, an adiabatic path from AFM-A to AFM-E phase is assumed,\nin such a way that the direction of Mn spins are progressively rotated from an in-plane FM to a zig-zaglike arrangement.[22] The ionic contribution from core\nelectrons and protons are added to BP calculated for\nthe fully occupied valence states. In Fig.2 and Table\nI we show the displacements of the atoms in the noncentrosymmetric AFM-E spin-configuration with respect\nto the centrosymmetric AFM-A structure. These quantities will be needed in the discussion reported below.\nBy using WFs, one can decompose the total polarization into contributions coming from each set of orbitals.\nFor clarity, we show in Fig.1 the AFM-E HoMnO3 insulating bandstructure where the relevant states are highlighted: Mn-eg , Mn-t2g and O-p orbitals. We have projected these three groups of occupied eigenstates into\nreal-space basis separately and \"maximally-localized\"\nthem to obtain the corresponding WFs. The contribution from deeper occupied valence states (such as O-2s\nand R-5s, -5p states) is neglected in the WF approach.\nHere, the total polarization is the sum of the displacements of the centers of each WF from the position of the\ncorresponding ion plus PCM contribution. For the details of the construction and interpretation of WFs, see\nRef.19.\nAccording to the different approaches, our estimated\nvalues for the polarization in AFM-E HoMnO3 are PBP\n= -6.14 \u03bcC/cm2 , PWF = -5.61 \u03bcC/cm2 and PPCM = 2.09 \u03bcC/cm2 along Z axis. The values of P along X\nand Y axis are both negligible in each approach. The\nlarge difference of the values of PWF (PBP ) from PPCM\nis remarkable.\n\nZ\n\n!p\n\nO(4)ap\n\nO(1)p\n\nX\n\nMn(0)!\n\nP\n\nO(3)ap\nO(2)p\n\nMn!\nMn\"\n\n!ap\n\nO\n\nFIG. 2: Atomic displacements in FE HoMnO3 , as obtained\nby the difference of atomic coordinates in optimized AFM-E\nand optimized AFM-A spin configuration (length of arrows in\narbitrary units).

Table\nII shows the orbital-decomposed polarization obtained\nby the displacement of the center of WF (WFC) with\nrespect to ionic positions for each set of bands. By definition, the sum of the WFC displacements gives the difference between PWF and PPCM , which can be regarded\nas the difference between the dynamical charge Z \u2217 and\nstatic (nominal) charge Z. In other words, it quantifies\nthe effects of going from a more ionic charge distribution\nto more covalent bonding state. By means of the WF\nanalysis, not only one can obtain relevant information\non which orbital causes the anomalous contribution, but\nalso a real-space picture of the polar orbital states.\nLet us first focus on the eg -like dz2 and dyz orbitals\nwhich, together with O-p orbitals, mostly contribute to\npolarization (see main displacements along the polar c\naxis inTable. II).\nFirst, consider the eg -orbital at Mn(0)-up site surrounded by four O ions and four second-neighbor Mn\nions in the ac plane (Fig.3 a). Because of the JT-derived\norbital ordering, the eg :dz2 orbital of Mn(0) ion is pointing towards the two O ions along long axis (z in the\n\"local\" frame). Therefore, it makes a \u03c3 bonding with\nO(1)p - and O(3)ap -pz orbitals. In addition, when considering the AFM-E spin configuration, the up-spin electron of the eg -orbital of the Mn(0) ion can hop only onto\n\n\f4\n\n(a) Mn-eg : dz2\nMn(1)!\n\nTABLE II: WFC displacements from atomic coordinates in\nAFM-E HoMnO3 (\u00c5).

To increase hopping, Mn(0) moves \"right\" (see filled arrow), giving\na lower weight of WF on Mn(0) but larger on Mn(1) [represented as dashed vs solid (before vs after displacement) Gaussians on the atoms].

Only four typical\nWFs in the ac plane are shown. a) Op -py , b) Op -pz , c)Oap -py ,\nd)Oap -pz (up spin state). Arrows indicate the displacement\nof the centers of WFs from the O atomic position.\n\nMn(1) (up spin) site via the O(1)p atom but not on the\nMn(3) (down spin) site. This asymmetric hopping gives\nthe considerable deviation of the WFC from the atom\nposition (0.26 \u00c5) whose direction is shown as a green arrow in Fig.3a. Recall that the hopping integral between\nMn-eg orbitals depends on both the Mn-O bond length\nd and the Mn-O-Mn angle \u03c6, the hopping energy being\ntherefore optimal for larger \u03c6. As a consequence, in order to increase the hopping, the Mn(0) ion is expected\nto move toward O(3)ap to increase \u03c6p between parallel\nMn spins, i.e. along a direction which is opposite to\nthe WFC displacement. In the same aim of increasing\nhopping, O(1)p moves perpendicularly to the Mn\u2191 -Mn\u2191\nbonding. Similarly, the O(3)ap atom is displaced perpendicularly to the Mn\u2191 -Mn\u2193 bonding (see rough schematization of atomic displacements shown in Fig.5). This\nis consistent with what is shown in Fig.2 and Table I.\nThe ions therefore move to enhance the polarization induced by the asymmetric hopping of eg -orbital electrons.\n\n\f5\nOur proposed mechanism is quantitatively confirmed by\nthe values of the eg hopping integrals from the WF centered at Mn(0) site to the one at Mn(1) site (taken from\noff-diagonal matrix element of the Hamiltonian, see Ref.\n[19]): in the optimized AFM-E phase, the hopping integral t = 117 meV is enhanced with respect to t = 100\nmeV in optimized AFM-A phase (despite the increase in\nthe long Mn-O bond-length after ionic relaxation which\nwould counteract the increase in hopping given by the\nincreased Mn-O-Mn angle). The hopping in the optimized AFM-E phase is also increased with respect to t\n= 108 meV in optimized AFM-A atomic coordinates but\nwith the AFM-E spin configuration. In parallel, the band\nenergy (i.e. on-site energy, taken from diagonal Hamiltonian elements) related to eg states reduces along the\nAFM-A\u2192AFM-E adiabatic path with the ionic displacements, being minimal in the optimized AFM-E phase\n(i.e. 8.98 eV vs 9.03 eV). Therefore, the increase in t\nand decrease in energy in the AFM-E spin-configuration\nis mainly determined by the Mn-O-Mn angle dependence\nand to a less extent by the Mn-O bond-length.\nWe further remark that the movement of the Mn ion\n(cfr Fig. 5) causes a current whose direction coincides\nwith the current by the electron hopping and, therefore, it reinforces the net electronic polarization. It\nshould be noted that the atomic displacement (0.04 \u00c5)\nis very small compared to the deviation of the Wannier center (0.26 \u00c5). We recall in fact that the atomic\ndisplacement is just a secondary effect which occurs\nin order to enhance the asymmetric hopping integrals.\nThis magnetically-induced mechanism is therefore different from the conventional interpretation of polarization\nin standard ferroelectrics[25] where the atomic displacement dominates the effect.\nNext, consider the t2g :dyz orbital which makes a \u03c0-like\nbonding with surrounding oxygen p orbitals. Because the\ndyz orbital has isotropic symmetry in the plane, the hybridization with the p orbital depends only on the bonddistance. In Fig.3b, strong hybridization of dyz orbital\nwith O(2)p -pz and O(4)ap -pz is shown. Similar to the eg\norbital case, the electron hops only into Mn(2)-up site\nso that the WFC is displaced in such a way (see green\narrow in Fig.3b). Moreover, the atomic displacement\ninduced by the eg orbital - explained above - causes a\nshorter bond length between Mn(0) and O(3)ap ions (see\nweight of Mn-t2g WF on O(3)ap ); as a consequence, the\nincreased hybridization slightly changes the direction of\nthe WFC displacement with respect to the Mn(0)-Mn(2)\ndirection. Therefore, in HoMnO3 , the anomalous contributions from Mn-eg and t2g orbitals almost cancel each\nother along the polar c direction, whereas the O-p contribution survives. In order to complete our analysis, we\ntherefore show in Fig. 4 the Op WF. What happens is\nqualitatively explained as follows: i) the WFC of Op :py\nstate (forming a \u03c0-bonding with the same-spin Mn-t2g\nstate) is pulled by the short-distant Mn(1) ion (cfr Fig.\n4 a); ii) the WFC of Oap :pz which makes a \u03c3-bonding\nwith the Mn(0)-eg state is pulled by the Mn(0) ion in the\n\nsame way (cfr Fig. 4 d); iii) the WFC of Op :pz which\nforms a \u03c3-bonding with both Mn(1)- and Mn(0)-eg states\nis displaced towards the Mn(1) ion but also moves to increase the Mn-O-Mn angle, with a resulting displacement\nroughly parallel to the c axis (cfr Fig. 4 b); iv) the WFC\nof Oap :py which does not form strong bonding with shortdistant Mn ions shows a small displacement (cfr Fig. 4\nc).\n\nIV.\n\nCHEMICAL TRENDS IN RMnO3\n\nFrom the experimental point of view, the magnetic\ntrend of RMnO3 was found to be strongly affected by\nthe Mn-O-Mn bond angle \u03c6 in the MnO2 plane. From\nR=La to Gd, where \u03c6=155-146\u25e6, the ground state is Atype AFM; upon decreasing of \u03c6, there is an intermediate \"lock-in incommensulate-AF state\" which couples to\na ferroelectric polarization at R=Tb and Dy, followed by\na transition to the E-type AFM observed from R=Ho to\nLu, where \u03c6=144-140\u25e6.[29]\nWhen \u03c6 is close enough to 180\u25e6 , the in-plane FM coupling in AFM-A phase can be explained on the basis\nof Kanamori-Goodenough rules [28] in the framework\nof Mn-O \"semicovalent bonding\". However, when \u03c6 decreases, the overlap of Mn and O orbitals becomes smaller\nand Kanamori-Goodenough rules are not sufficient to\nexplain the complex phase diagram of manganites. Instead, the next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange becomes relatively dominant and the E type\nAFM state becomes stable.[29] In the following section,\nwe will address quantitatively these general arguments\nand discuss how magnetic interactions are affected by \u03c6.\n\nA.\n\nStructural and magnetic properties\n\n1.\n\nAtomic optimization in the AFM-A phase\n\nThe atomic structure of RMnO3 compounds has\nbeen investigated by neutron powder diffraction [12](for\nR=Pr, Nd, Dy, Tb, Ho, Er, Y), single crystal X-ray\ndiffractometry [11](for R=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd) and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction measurement [10](for\nR=Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu).\nFirst, in order to discuss the magnetic stability in a\ntiny range of energy, we have used the experimental lattice parameters, where the volume of the unit cell linearly\ndecreases in the series according to the Lanthanide contraction upon increasing the atomic number of R atom;\nwe have optimized the internal structural parameters imposing AFM-A spin configuration on Mn-d electrons.\nThe reason why we used the AFM-A configuration is\nbased on the fact that most of these compounds (where\nR = La to Gd) show as ground state the AFM-A spinconfiguration.\nSecond, to discuss ferroelectric properties, the atomic\nstructure was optimized with AFM-E spin configuration\n\n\f6\n\n2.\n\nMagnetic Stability\n\nUsing the optimized atomic structure obtained by\nimposing the AFM-A spin configuration, the total energy of AFM-A, -C, -G, -E and -E* was calculated\n(Fig.7(a)). This result shows a very clear trend which\ngives the transition from AFM-A phase to AFM-E phase\nat SmMnO3 . Although the optimization imposing AFMA spin ordering enhances the stability of AFM-A, the\nresults show that the AFM-E phase is most stable at\nR= Gd, at variance with experimental results reporting that the AFM-A phase is the spin ground-state even\nin GdMnO3 . The disagreement with experiments may\nagain come from the use of LDA/GGA. Possible improvements might be obtained upon use of an LDA/GGA+U\neffective potential[31] to enhance the localization of Mn-d\nstate and reproduce the correct ground state in GdMnO3 .\nHowever, the change of energy is quite sensitive to the\nvalue of U (which is, by the way, unknown for most of\nthe compounds): in our previous calculations [32] , small\nvalue of U (\u223c 2.5eV) were found to stabilize AFM-A\nphase with respect to AFM-E in HoMnO3 , at variance\nwith experiments which show the AFM-E as groundstate.[8, 33] In order to avoid any additional parameters\nand to discuss the trend of the manganites series without further bias, we don't employ the LDA/GGA+U approach and focus on qualitative prediction of chemical\ntrends (as a function of the rare-earth ion), which are\nexpected to be well reproduced within a bare GGA ap-\n\nMn\u2212O distance (\u00c5)\n\n2.3\n\n(a)\n\n2.2\ncalc l\ncalc s\ncalc m\nexp l\nexp s\nexp m\n\n2.1\n2\n1.9\nLa\n\nPr\n\nNd\n\nSm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu\n\n155\n\nMn\u2212O\u2212Mn Angle (deg)\n\nwhich, as discussed for HoMnO3 , breaks the inversion\nsymmetry of the system and leads to a magnetically induced polarization. The results of this second part will\nbe discussed in a later section.\nThe optimized structural parameters in AFM-A spin\nconfiguration, reported in Table.III and Fig.6, give a\nrather regular trend in the series. As for the Mn-O bond\nlength, m and s look rather constant over the series,\nwhereas l shows a broad maximum at Gd. Although calculated inter-planar lengths m show good agreement with\ncorresponding experimental values, the in-plane lengths\nl and s show some deviation (< 10%) with respect to experiments, so that the JT-distortion is underestimated in\nour calculations. The deviation mainly derives from the\nlack of an exact treatment of the exchange-correlation\npotential (and/or many-body effects) at the LDA/GGA\nlevel: in our simulations, the rather correlated Mn-d electrons are described as more delocalized than in real manganites, so that the JT-distortion is reduced. [30]\nAs for the Mn-O-Mn bond angle, it decreases almost\nlinearly with the R ionic radius. The inter-plane angle\nbecomes larger than in-plane angle for small values of the\nradius or R ion. Moreover, the difference between the\ntwo Mn-O distances (l and s) becomes rather constant\nat R = Gd. This implies that the JT-distortion is rather\n\"saturated\" compared with the GdFeO3 -like tilting in a\nMn-O6 octahedron.\n\n150\n\n(b)\n\n145\n\ncalc\ncalc ||\nexp\nexp ||\n\n140\n\n135\n\nLa\n\nPr\n\nNd\n\n1.2\n\nSm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu\n\n1.15\n\nrR\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n\n(\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Mn-O bond distance of of RMnO3 as a function\nof rR (radius of Rare earth ion R3+ ).

J||nn represents the sum of two\ncompeting interactions (FM coupling due to eg orbitals\nand AFM coupling due to t2g coupling); the global FM\nbehaviour shows that the former dominates. However,\nwhen \u03c6 decreases, the orbital overlap between Mn-eg orbitals making \u03c3 bonding with O-p orbital is strongly reduced and this, in turn, reduces the FM character of J||nn .\nIn-plane anti-ferromagnetic J||nnn stays rather constant,\nat variance with what proposed in the model study by\nKimura et al where J||nnn increases with \u03c6.[29] The interplane coupling is expected to be AFM, due to its mainly\nt2g -driven character. The fact that it is estimated to be\nweakly FM (< 2 meV) in LaMnO3 casts some doubts\nabout the validity of a bare GGA treatment for LaMnO3\n(where the AFM-A spin-state is found basically degenerate with the FM spin configuration, obviously at variance with experiments). On the other hand, the correct\nspin ground-state is reproduced for most of the RMnO3\n(with exceptions of i) the above mentioned Gd andii) Tb\nand Dy where we did not attempt to simulate the noncollinear spiral arrangements, due to further complexity\nin the simulations).[29]\nFigure 7(c) shows the total energy using Eqn.(3) and\n(6): within the mean field approximation, this energy is\n\nsupposed to be proportional to the ordering Neel temperature TN . Indeed, the trend is in good agreeement\nwith experimental results, showing a steeply decreasing\nTN with AFM-A in the first half of the series and a rather\nconstant TN with AFM-E in the second half.\nAs a summary of this section, an increase of \u03c6 strongly\nreduces eg -derived J||nn but doesn't change drastically the\nJ||nnn exchange constant, so that the AFM-A phase shows\na spin transition to AFM-E phase.\n\nB.\n\nThe multiferroic AFM-E spin configuration\n1.\n\nStructural properties\n\nIn order to discuss the chemical trends of ferroelectric\nproperties, we optimized the internal atomic positions in\nthe RMnO3 systems by artificially imposing the AFM-E\nspin configuration for all RMnO3 (irrespective of whether\nor not the AFM-E is the spin ground-state). The resulting symmetry (lowered by the spin configuration with\nrespect to the AFM-A spin arrangements), allows two\nsignificantly different values of l and \u03c6 between parallel and anti-parallel Mn-spins whereas the optimized s\ndoesn't change (cfr Fig.8). This is consistent with our\nmechanism proposed for HoMnO3 in the previous section: since the long Mn-O bond length is mostly affected\nby the ferroelectric AFM-E spin configuration (cfr Fig.8)\nand it is the one along which the Mn-dz2 orbital is pointing, it is likely that this latter orbital plays a key role\nin the final ferroelectricity. We also note that, along the\nseries, the difference between \u03c6p and \u03c6ap stays rather constant; since, according to Ref. [3], this difference is at the\nbasis of the polar atomic displacements, this constant behaviour will be relevant in the discussion of polarization\ntrends vs R (see below).\n\n\f8\nTotal Energy Difference (meV/Mn)\n\n120\n\nAFM\u2212A (a)\nAFM\u2212C\nAFM\u2212G\nAFM\u2212E*\nAFM\u2212E\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\nLa\n\nPr\n\nNd\n\nSm\n\nGd Tb Dy HoEr Tm Lu\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\nAFM\n\n4\n\nJ (meV)\n\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\nJ^ 1\nJ^ 2\nJ || nn\nJ || nnn\n\nFM\n\n\u22126\n\u22128\n\u221210\n\nFIG. 8: The Mn-O bond length (upper panel) and Mn-OMn bond angle (lower panel) as a function of rR in RMnO3\nstructure optimized in AFM-E phase.

The in-plane Mn-O-Mn bond angle \u03c6 is\naveraged between \u03c6p and \u03c6ap .\n\nand 0.96 at R=Lu. This implies that the orbital ordering\nis already \"saturated\" at LaMnO3 .\nA progressive distortion of the structure is shown to\nincrease the energy gap Eg and to decrease the width\nof the eg -band (w). Within a tight-binding framework,\nw is proportional to the hopping integral t. Indeed, we\nestimated the hopping integral for selected compounds\nalong the series and found that t increases with the ionic\nradius of the R ion (see Table IV).\nHere, we would like to point out that the DOS doesn't\nchange significantly before and after FE atomic displacements, at variance with standard FE (such as BaTiO3 ),\nwhere FE atomic displacements are accompanied by a rehybridization of filled O-p and empty cation d states.[34]\nHere, we recall that the Mn-d state is well localized and\nthe character of the Mn-O bond is rather ionic in nature\nso it is not expected to undergo drastic changes upon development of polarization as far as the bonding properties\nare concerned.\n\n3.\n\nFerroelectricity and link to lattice, spin and orbital\ndegrees of freedom\n\nSimilarly to the case of HoMnO3 , we have calculated\nthe polarization according to the PCM, BP and WF approaches. As shown in Fig.10, the polarization calculated\nby BP and WF are consistent within less than 10 %: this\ndifference (in addition to possible numerical uncertainties\nderiving from the use of a different basis set and potential\n\nR = La\n-4.76\n1.36\n-0.96\n-4.36\n-8.72\n\nNd\n-3.48\n1.73\n-1.00\n-2.75\n-5.50\n\nSm\n-3.01\n2.02\n-1.17\n-2.16\n-4.32\n\nHo\n-2.67\n2.42\n-1.51\n-1.76\n-3.52\n\nLu\n-2.61\n2.47\n-1.55\n-1.69\n-3.38\n\ntreatments in VASP and FLEUR codes for BP and WF\napproaches, respectively) comes from O-2s, R-5s, R-5p\ncontributions and shows that these latter contributions,\nas expected, are small compared to Mn-d and O-p contributions.\nWhat is truly remarkable is that the polarization (both\nfrom BP and WF) shows a rapid increase upon decreasing of \u03c6 (PBP approaches 12 \u03bcC/cm2 in an hypothetical\nAFM-E LaMnO3 ), whereas PPCM is to a large extent constant. This latter trend is consistent with the constant\nbehavior of \u03c6p \u2212 \u03c6ap shown in Fig.8 and with what previously discussed in Refs. [3, 7]. Moreover, the difference\nbetween PBP /PWF and PPCM (which represents a purely\nelectronic contribution) is much bigger than the contribution coming from atomic displacementsin the entire\nseries. This confirms the different nature of the magnetic\norigin of ferroelectricity in manganites with respect to\nstandard \"proper\" ferroelectrics.\nOur results further suggest that orbital ordering is necessary for the rising of the polarization; however, being\nconstant along the series, is not responsible for the trend\nof FE polarization, which, on the other hand, shows dramatic changes as a function of R. Consistently with what\npreviously discussed for HoMnO3 where t is suggested to\nplay a important role, the dramatic increase in the asymmetric eg hopping is responsible for enhancing P in less\ndistorted manganites (cfr Tab. V where we report the\ndifferent contribution of Mn-eg , Mn-t2g and O-p to the\ntotal PWF ). We show that, for every R, the Mn-eg and\nO-p contributions show an opposite sign with respect to\nthe Mn-t2g term with regular trends along the series. Indeed, remembering that the hopping integral t depends\non the bond length and bond angle, one expects smaller\nl and larger \u03c6 to enhance t between eg orbitals, whereas\nsmaller s to enhance t between t2g orbitals; this is confirmed by looking carefully at table.V and Fig.8 and their\nimplications for the values of P (cfr. Fig. 10).\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFerroelectricity, recently proposed for the collinear\nAFM-E magnetic phase in orthorhombic HoMnO3 , is\n\n\f10\nhere explained microscopically from first-principles via\na careful Wannier function analysis. We show that the\nasymmetric electron hopping of orbitally-polarized Mneg states is the key ingredient for the rising of polarization. At variance with proper ferroelectrics, in HoMnO3\nthe purely electronic contribution (due to Wannier function centers which are largely displaced with respect to\nions) dominates the polarization, with respect to the contribution to P coming from ionic movements. However,\nthe net polarization along the c axis is the result of a\ndelicate balance of different contributions, such as, for\nexample, the opposite signs of the Mn eg and t2g contributions to P .\nIn addition, extensive ab\u2013initio calculations have been\nperformed for the RMnO3 systems, focusing on the link\nbetween ferroelectricity and the spin, orbital and lattice\ndegrees of freedom in the aim of identifying chemical\ntrends along the series. In summary, the results are summarized as: i) ferromagnetic Jknn increases with the MnO-Mn angle \u03c6, whereas antiferromagnetic Jknnn is rather\nconstant with \u03c6; ii) Peg increases with \u03c6 and decreases\nwith l, whereas Pt2g decreases with s and partially cancels Peg . iii) orbital ordering, a needed ingredient in the\nrising of P , is however saturated along the series and does\n\nnot influence the trend of polarization as a function of R.\nTherefore, the main message is that one can expect\nhigh ferroelectric polarization with large \u03c6 and small l\nin the AFM-E phase; however, such large \u03c6 would simultaneously increase the ferromagnetic Jknn , therefore\nstabilizing the centrosymmetric AFM-A spin configuration instead of the polar AFM-E phase. The problem is\nthen how to increase P , still keeping the AFM-E phase as\nstable spin-state (i.e. via strain, pressure, alloying, etc):\nwe hope that our findings will be helpful to answer this\nquestion.\n\n[1] S.W.Cheong and M.Mostovoy, Nature Mater. 6, 13\n(2007).\n[2] T.
