The classical index formulae for Todd genus, Euler number, and Signature correspond to\nthe case when the complex variable y = 0, \u22121, and 1 respectively. Here\nwe give a direct derivation of this nice formula based on supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has been known for about twenty years that the Atiyah-Singer formula[1]\nfor the index of Dirac operator can be directly derived from supersymmetric\n(SUSY) quantum mechanics [2], [3]. Indeed, the well-known index formulae for\nEuler number, signature, Todd genus and \u00c2-genus can each be derived directly\nfrom a simple supersymmetric quantum mechanic model.\nIn this paper we would like to point out that the formula for the Hirzebruch \u03c7y -genus on K\u00e4hler manifolds can also be derived directly from a simple\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanic model.\nLet M be a complex d-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold, bi,j the (i, j)-Hodge\nnumber of M , then the Hirzebruch \u03c7y -genus is defined to be\nX\n(\u22121)i y j bi,j .\n(1)\n\u03c7y (M ) =\ni,j\n\nLet \u03a9 = [\u03a9k\u0304l ]1\u2264k, l\u2264d be the curvature 2-form of the K\u00e4hler metric, \u2212i\u03a9n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 d) the eigenvalue of antihermitian matrix \u03a9, y a complex variable,\nx\n\u2212x\n. Then, the formulae for the Hirzebruch \u03c7y -genus is\nsinhy (x) := e +ye\n2\nZ Y\n\u03a9n /2\u03c0\n\u03c7y (M ) =\nsinhy (\u03a9n /4\u03c0) top form .\n(2)\nM n sinh(\u03a9n /4\u03c0)\n1\n\n\f(Note that the integrand is a symmetric polynomial in \u03a91 , ..., \u03a9d , hence it is a\npolynomial in traces of products of \u03a9, i.e., a polynomial in Chern classes. Note\nalso that since both sides of (2) are polynomials in y, we just need to derive (2)\nfor y being a complex number with unit norm.)\n\n2\n\nSUSY Quantum Mechanics\n\nTo begin with, following [5] (but with dimension reduced from 1 + 1 to 0 + 1),\nwe recall the standard supersymmetric quantum mechanics model on a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold M with K\u00e4hler metric g. It governs maps \u03a6 : [0, \u03b2] \u2192 X, with [0, \u03b2]\nbeing a close interval. If we pick local coordinates t on [0, \u03b2] and \u03c6I on M , then\n\u03a6 can be described locally via functions \u03c6I (t). The local complex coordinates\non M are denoted by \u03c6i , and the complex conjugate are denoted by \u03c6\u012b = \u03c6i . Let\nT \u2032 M be the holomorphic tangent bundle of M and T \u2032\u2032 M the antiholomorphic\ni\ni\ntangent bundle of M . The fermi fields of the model are \u03c8+\n, \u03c8\u2212\n, sections of\n\u012b\n\u012b\nT M , and \u03c8+\n, \u03c8\u2212\nsections of T \u2032\u2032 M . The Lagrangian is\n\nI=\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nj\nj\n\u012b\n\u012b\ni j\u0304 k l\u0304\n\u2207t \u03c8+\n+ Rij\u0304kl\u0304 \u03c8+\n\u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212 \u03c8\u2212\ndt g\u012bj \u03c6\u0307\u012b \u03c6\u0307j + ig\u012bj \u03c8\u2212\n\u2207t \u03c8\u2212\n+ ig\u012bj \u03c8+\n\n(3)\n\nThe canonical quantization of this model gives rise to the anticommutation\nrelations among fermi fields at a fixed time t, the nontrivial part of which is\n\u012b\ni\n\u012b\ni\n}|t = 2 = {\u03c8+\n, \u03c8+\n}|t .\n{\u03c8\u2212\n, \u03c8\u2212\n\n(4)\n\ni\n\u012b\ni\n\u012b\nTake \u03c8+\n(t), \u03c8\u2212\n(t) as the creation operators and \u03c8\u2212\n(t), \u03c8+\n(t) as the annihilation operators, then the Fock space that these fermion operators generate is\n\u2227\u2217,\u2217 (T\u03a6(t) M \u2297C). So the Hilbert space of the model (denoted by H) is the space\ni\n\u012b\nof complex differential forms, with \u03c8\u2212\nacting like idz i , \u03c8\u2212\nacting like idz \u012b \u2227,\n\u012b\ni\ni\n\u012b\nand \u03c8+ acting like idz \u2227, \u03c8+ acting like idz . This space admits a Z \u00d7 Zgrading, given by operators F+ and F\u2212 , which counts the plus-fermion numbers\n(holomorphic degree) and the minus-fermion numbers (antiholomorphic degree)\nrespectively.\nLet H be the Hamiltonian of the model, q a complex number modulus one,\nq\u0304 the complex conjugate of q.

The space\nof supersymmetric invariant states (denoted by H0 ) is identified with the space\nof complex harmonic forms. Then a standard argument in SUSY quantum\nmechanics shows that the left hand side of (5) is independent of \u03b2 and can be\nsimplified as\n\u0001\nT rH0 (\u22121)F\u2212 (\u2212q)F+\n(8)\nwhich is obviously the left-hand side of (2) with y = \u2212q.\nIt remains to show that the path integral in (5) can be simplified as the\nright-hand side of (2), and this will be done in the following section.\n\n3\n\nEvaluation of the Path Integral\n\nSince the path integral is independent of \u03b2, it is convenient to take the limit\n\u03b2 \u2192 0, when many higher-order interaction terms drop out from the action.\nAs \u03b2 \u2192 0 the penalty for time variation in the bosonic fields becomes larger\nand larger, and the nonconstant boson modes are confined to narrower and\nnarrower rangers; they are then approximated better and better by tangent\nspace variables. This allows the considerable simplification of describing their\ncontributions to the path integral as integrals over flat vector spaces. The two\nmain problems in calculating the functional integral are to identify the leading\nterms as \u03b2 \u2192 0 and to determine the proper integration measure.\nWe will first consider the integration measure for the nonzero modes. This\ncan be determined from the free Euclidean action.\nLet q = ei\u03b4 .

Since the path integral is invariant under changes in coordinates, we\nmay perform the tangent space integrations using normal coordinates centered\nat the corresponding point in M . This means that we may set xi0 = 0 when\nperforming these integrations.\nChoosing a geodesic normal coordinate system around point x0 , the action\nreads\nSE = S0 + S1 + O(\u03b2)\n(10)\nwhere\nS0 =\n\ni\nXh\n(2\u03c0n)2 a\u012bn ain + i2\u03c0n(\u03c8n\u012b \u03c8ni + \u03b7n\u012b \u03b7ni )\n\n(11)\n\nn\n\nand\nS1 =\n\nX\u0014\n\nn6=0\n\ni\u03a9k\u0304l (inak\u0304n aln )\n\n\u0015\ni\u03a9k\u0304l k\u0304 l\ni\u03a9\n\u012b i\n\u2212\n\u03b7n \u03b7n + i\u03b4\u03b7n \u03b7n + ei\u03b4/2 (\u2212 k\u0304l \u03b70k\u0304 \u03b70l + i\u03b4\u03b70\u012b \u03b70i )\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03a9k\u0304l = R\u012bj k\u0304l \u03c80\u012b \u03c80j .\nThe integration measure is\n[dx][d\u03c8\u2212 ][d\u03c8+ ] =\n\nY\n\ndxi0 dx\u012b0 d\u03c80i d\u03c80\u012b d\u03b70i d\u03b70\u012b d\u03bci\n\ni\n\nwhere\nd\u03bci =\n\nY\n\n(\n\nn6=0\n\n1\ndai da\u012b d\u03c8 i d\u03c8 \u012b d\u03b7 i d\u03b7 \u012b )\n2\u03c0i n n n n n n\n\nand is determined by requiring\nZ Y\n\nd\u03bci e\u2212S0 = 1.\n\ni\n\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\fLet \u03a9 = [\u03a9k\u0304l ]1\u2264k, l\u2264d be the antihermitian curvature matrix, I the identity\nQ\nmatrix, integrating e\u2212SE over i d\u03b70i d\u03b70\u012b d\u03bci , we get (in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 0)\n!\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013Y\ni\u03a9\ni\u03a9 2\n( 4\u03c0\n( 4\u03c0\n)\n\u2212 i 2\u03b4 I)2\n\u22121\ni\u03b4/2 i\u03a9\ndet e\n(\ndet I +\n(14)\n\u2212 i\u03b4I)\nI+\ndet\n2\u03c0\n(n\u03c0)2\n(n\u03c0)2\nn>0\n\nTo evaluate the above expression, we assume \u03a9 can be put in the diagonal\nform:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212i\u03a91\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\u03a9=\uf8ed\n(15)\n\uf8f8,\n.\n\u2212i\u03a9d\n\u0001\nQ\nx 2\nthen we get (using formula sinh x = x n>0 1 + ( n\u03c0\n) )\nY\n\u03a9i /2\u03c0\nsinhy (\u03a9i /4\u03c0)\n(16)\nsinh(\u03a9\ni /4\u03c0)\ni\nx\n\nwhere y = \u2212ei\u03b4 and sinhy (x) = e +ye\n. This has a power series expansion\n2\nwhich terminatesQbecause of the Fermi statistics of the zero\nQ modes of \u03c8\u2212 . Integrating it over i d\u03c80i d\u03c80\u012b projects out the coefficient of i \u03c80i \u03c80\u012b in the integrand, i.e., the top form, which is proportional to the volume form on M . For\nthe form (15) of \u03a9, the path integral reduces to\nZ Y\n\u03a9i /2\u03c0\nsinhy (\u03a9i /4\u03c0) top form\n(17)\nsinh(\u03a9\ni /4\u03c0)\nM i\n\u2212x\n\nConsider more general forms for \u03a9, we note that expression (14) can be seen\nas a sum of traces of products of curvature forms, i.e., a polynomial in Chern\nclasses. The splitting principle then states that to calculate this polynomial, we\nmay specialize to the case evaluated explicitly above, where the vector bundle\nin question splits into a sum of line bundles.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
