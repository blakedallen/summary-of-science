For any root \u03b1 we call r\u03b1 the involution\nassociated to \u03b1. The group W is referred to as the Weyl group of R and group\nelements of the form r\u03b1 are called root involutions.\nWe have introduced the new notion of root sets to encompasses different\nconcepts of root systems. For instance R is a root set for the Weyl group\ninvolved if R\na) is a finite (not necessarily crystallographic) root system.\nb) consists of the roots associated to a set of root data in the sense of Moody\nand Pianzola (see [MP95]), or if R is the root system of a Coxeter group\n1\n\n\f2\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nin the sense of Deodhar (see [Deo82]) or a root system of the slightly\nmore general kind studied in [Hof99] based on Vinberg's idea of a discrete\nlinear group W generated by reflections (see [Vin71]).\nc) consists of the real roots of a locally finite root system in the sense of\n[LN04].\nd) consists of the anisotropic roots of an extended affine root system (EARS).\nWe will say that W has a Coxeter presentation with respect to the root set, if\nthere is a subset S of root involutions in W such that (W, S) is a Coxeter system.\nIn cases a) and b) the Weyl group has a Coxeter presentation with respect\nto the root set. (See [MP95] Proposition 5.7.(i), [Deo82] Proposition 3.1.(i) and\n[Vin71] \u00a73 Theorem 2.1 for respective results for the case b).) We will show\nfor the case d) that the extended affine Weyl group (EAWeG) W has a Coxeter\npresentation with respect to the root set if and only if the nullity of the EARS\nis less or equal to 1.\nWe will investigate whether the Weyl group W of a root set R has the\npresentation\n(b\nr\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208R\u00d7\n\n| rb\u03b1 = rb\u03b2\nrb\u03b12\n\nif \u03b1 and \u03b2 are linearly dependent,\n\n(1)\n\n= 1,\n\nrb\u03b1 rb\u03b2 rb\u03b1\u22121 = rbr\u03b1 (\u03b2) ; for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R\u00d7 ,\n\nwhich is called the presentation by conjuagtion. The answer is yes in the cases\na) and b) since the existence of a Coxeter presentation with respect to the root\nset implies the existence of the presentation by conjugation. The answer is also\nyes in the case of c) (see [LN04] Theorem 5.12).\nThe answer is also known to be yes for various subclasses of EARSs and\ntheir EAWeGs (see [Aza99], [Aza00], [Kry00]). We show that an EAWeG has a\npresentation by conjugation with respect to its EARS if and only if it is minimal\n(see Definition 3.4.) As a consequence we get the following result: Every EAWeG\nhas the presentation by conjugation with respect to a suitable EARS.\nIt has come to our attention that a similar result has been obtained independently in [AS06]. There it is proved for the sub-case of EARSs of type A1 that\nthe minimality of a certain generating set of W is equivalent to the existence of\nthe presentation by conjugation.\nWe want to point out that the presentation in (1) is equivalent to the presentation\n(r\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208R\u00d7\n\n| r\u03b1 = r\u03b2\n\nif \u03b1 and \u03b2 are linearly dependent,\n\nr\u03b1 r\u03b2 r\u03b1 = rr\u03b1 (\u03b2) ; for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R\u00d7 .\nThe author would like to thank Erhard Neher at the University of Ottawa\nfor asking the right questions to stimulate the research for this work.\n\n\f3\n\n2 THE COXETER PRESENTATION\n\n2\n\nThe Coxeter Presentation\n\nIn this section we introduce the definition of a root set. This new notion is\ndesigned to encompass different concepts of root systems as well as the concept\nof a Coxeter system. The main result in this section is that an EAWeG as a\nCoxeter presentation with respect to its EARS if and only if the nullity is greater\nthan 1. We postpone the definition of an EARS until Section 3.\nDefinition 2.1 Let W be a group acting on a set R. We call R a root set for\nW if the following conditions are satisfied\n(i) For every \u03b1 \u2208 R there is an involution r\u03b1 \u2208 W, and the elements (r\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208R\ngenerate W.\n(ii) We have\nr\u03b1 r\u03b2 (r\u03b1 )\u22121 = rr\u03b1 (\u03b2)\nfor all \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2208 R.\nIf R is a root set for W, then we define\n\u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 : \u21d0\u21d2 r\u03b1 = r\u03b2 .\nThe elements of R are called roots. For any root \u03b1 we call r\u03b1 the reflection\nassociated to \u03b1. The group W is referred to as the Weyl group of R and group\nelements of the form r\u03b1 are called root involutions.\nRemark 2.2 The relation \u223c is a congruence relation, i.e. an equivalence relation satisfying\n\u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 \u21d0\u21d2 w.\u03b1 \u223c w.\u03b2,\nfor every w \u2208 W.\nExample 2.3 We refer the reader to the list of examples a) - d) given in the\nintroduction. We add one example to this list:\ne) If (W, S) is a Coxeter system, then\nT := {wsw\u22121 : w \u2208 W, s \u2208 S}\n\n(2)\n\nis a root set for W if we set rt = t. The equivalence relation in this setting\nis equality.\nLet R be a root set with Weyl group W. Let S be a subset of R such that\nthe group root involutions associated to the elements in S generate W and such\nthat\n(\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 S) \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 =\u21d2 \u03b1 = \u03b2.\nSet\nb S := (b\nW\nr\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208S\n\n| rb\u03b12 = 1 for \u03b1 \u2208 S,\n(b\nr\u03b1 rb\u03b2 )ord(r\u03b1 r\u03b2 ) = 1\n\n(3)\nfor \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R and ord(r\u03b1 r\u03b2 ) < \u221e\n\n\f4\n\n2 THE COXETER PRESENTATION\n\nwhere ord(*) stands for the order of a group element. Since the relations in\nthis presentation are true for the generators (r\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208S of W, there is a group\nb S \u2192 W that maps rb\u03b1 to r\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 S. Since \u03c6 has a\nhomomorphism \u03c6 : W\ngenerating set of W in its image, it is surjective.\nDefinition 2.4 We say that W has a Coxeter presentation (with respect to R\nand S) if \u03c6 is injective.\n\nThe requirement in this definition is equivalent to saying that there is a\nsubset S of root involutions such that (W, S) is a Coxeter system.\nExample 2.5 In the list of examples discussed in the Introduction and in Example 2.3 the following Weyl groups have a Coxeter presentation with respect\nto their root sets: a), b), e).\nWe will present an example of a root set R with a Weyl group which does\nnot permit a Coxeter presentation with respect to R.\nExample 2.6 Consider the real vector space V := R5 with the bilinear form\n(*, *) with matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0 1 0\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 1 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1 0 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 1 0 0 0\n\nwith respect to the standard basis. In V we consider the set\n\b\nR\u00d7 :=\n(z1 , z2 , z3 , 0, 0)|z1 , z2 \u2208 Z, z3 \u2208 {1, \u22121}, z1 z2 is even .\n\n(This is the set of anisotropic roots of an EARS of type A1 with nullity 2.)\nTo an element \u03b1 \u2208 R\u00d7 we associate the reflection\nr\u03b1 : V \u2192 V, v 7\u2192 v \u2212 2\n\n(v, \u03b1)\n\u03b1.\n(\u03b1, \u03b1)\n\nLet W be the subgroup of Aut(V ) generated by the reflections {r\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 R\u00d7 }.\nThen R\u00d7 is a root set for W.\nLemma 2.7 The group W in the previous example does not have a Coxeter\npresentation with respect to R\u00d7 .\nProof. We will follow the proof in [Hof04] Example 4.3.36. Suppose that S\nis a subset of R\u00d7 such that W has a Coxeter presentation with respect to R\u00d7\nand S. Then span S is three dimensional: The subspace U := span S has at\nleast dimension 1, since S contains an element of R\u00d7 . Now U is a W-invariant\nsubspace. Dimension 1 or 2 contradict the fact the orbit under W of any root\nspans a 3-dimensional subspace.\n\n\f5\n\n2 THE COXETER PRESENTATION\n\nIt is easily verified that the product of two reflections in W has infinite order.\nb S is the free group generated by the involutions associated to S. We showed\nSo W\nthat S must contain 3 linearly independent roots say \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u03b13 . Denote the\nsubgroup of W generated by the set S\u2032 := {r\u03b11 , r\u03b12 , r\u03b13 } by W\u2032 . We are done if\nwe show that (W\u2032 , S\u2032 ) is not a Coxeter system. (For the necessary result about\nparabolic subgroups see [Hum92] Theorem in Section 5.5). So without loss of\ngenerality, we may assume that we have\n\u03b11 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)T , \u03b12 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0)T , and \u03b13 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0)T .\nFor the associated reflections ri := r\u03b1i (i = 1, 2, 3) it can be verified by\ngeometric arguments or by a matrix computation that\nr1 r2 r3 r1 r2 r3 r2 r1 r3 r2 r1\nr1 r2 r3 r1 r2 r3 r2 r1 r3 r2 r1 r3\n\n= r3\n\nor, equivalently\n\n= 1\n\nWe provide here the matrices corresponding\nand leave the computations to the reader:\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n1 0 \u22122 \u22122\n1 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec0 1 0 0 0\uf8f7 \uf8ec0 1 0\n0\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 \u22121 0 0\uf8f7 , \uf8ec0 0 \u22121 \u22122\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0 0 0 1 0\uf8f8 \uf8ed0 0 0\n1\n0 0 0\n0\n0 0 0 0 1\n\nto the three reflections r1 , r2 , r3\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n0\n\n0 0 0\n1 \u22122 0\n0 \u22121 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u22122\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u22122\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\nb S . See for example, [Hum92] 8.1:\nThe relation above is not satisfied in W\nb S any word of length greater than zero, which contains no subsequent\nIn W\nrepetition of an element of {b\nr\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 S}, does not represent the identity. So the\nb\nhomomorphism WS \u2192 W is not injective.\n\nIn [Hof04] Lemma 4.3.33 it is shown that the involutions in W are exactly the\nreflections in W. Moreover, the reflections in W are exactly the root reflections,\nin other words there are no ghost reflections, i.e. reflections in the group that\nare not associated to a root. (From [Hof04] Theorem 4.4.47 and Theorem 4.4.51\nit follows that these ghost reflections only occur in higher dimensions).\nAll of this taken together results in\nProposition 2.8 The group W is not a Coxeter group, i.e. there is no root set\nR for W such that W has a Coxeter presentation with respect to R.\nThe question arrises which EARS have a Coxeter presentation of the Weyl\ngroup with respect to the underlying root set. An EARS with nullity 0 is just\na finite root system with zero added. It is known that a Coxeter presentation\nwith respect to the root set exists for this case. The anisotropic roots of an\nEARS with nullity 1 can be viewed as a root system in the sense of [MP95].\nAgain, a Coxeter presentation with respect to the underlying root set exists.\nIf the nullity of an EARS is greater than or equal to 2 than there are always\n\n\f3 THE PRESENTATION BY CONJUGATION\n\n6\n\nthree anisotropic roots \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u03b13 whose reflections generate a subgroup of\nthe Weyl group isomorphic to W in the previous example. This means that the\nWeyl group does not allow a Coxeter presentation with respect to the underlying\nroot set, since a subgroup of a Coxeter group generated by reflections is always\na Coxeter group (See [Deo89], [Dye90] or [Hof04] Corollary 2.3.29). So we have\nTheorem 2.9 Let W be the Weyl group of an EARS with nullity \u03bd. Denote the\nset of anisotropic roots by R\u00d7 . Then W has a Coxeter presentation with respect\nto R\u00d7 if and only if \u03bd < 2.\nIt is more difficult to judge whether a given Weyl group of an EARS of\nnullity \u03bd \u2265 2 has a Coxeter presentation with respect to any root set. The\narguments used for the previous example to obtain Proposition 2.8 may fail in\ntwo ways: Firstly, not all involutions of the Weyl group must be reflections: The\nfinite root system B2 already contains a rotation about 180\u25e6 . Secondly, some\nreflections may be ghost reflections, i.e. they are not associated to a root in the\nroot system.\n\n3\n\nThe Presentation by Conjugation\n\nIn this section we introduce the notion of the presentation by conjugation of a\ngroup with respect to a root set. If a group W has a Coxeter presentaion with\nrespect to a root set R then W has a presentaion by conjugation with respect to\nthis root set. The key result of this section is that if a W has the presentation\nby conjugation with respect to R then R is minimal.\nLet R be a root set with Weyl group W.

Since no source for it is known to the author\nwe will include a proof.\nProposition 3.2 Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system. Consider the root set T for\nW described in Example 2.3. Then W has the presentation by conjugation with\nrespect to T .\n\n\f3 THE PRESENTATION BY CONJUGATION\n\n7\n\nb s 7\u2192 rbs\nProof. Set Sb = {b\nrs : s \u2208 S}. We want to show that the map S \u2192 S,\nb\ncan be extended to a map \u03c8 : W \u2192 W. For that purpose we need to show that\nthe relations defining the Coxeter group W (see (3)) hold for the generators Sb\nb The first defining relation in (3) is clear so let's look at the second:\nin W.\nIn W we have:\n(s1 s2 )m(s1 ,s2 )\n\n= 1.\n\nLet's consider the case that m(s1 , s2 ) is odd, say m(s1 , s2 ) = 2k + 1). Then this\nrelation together with the fact that s1 and s2 are involutions entails\n\u22121 k\n(s1 s2 )k s1 (s\u22121\n2 s1 )\n\n= s2 .\n\nb it follows that in W\nb we have\nFrom the defining relations of W\n(b\nr1 rb2 )k rb1 (b\nr2\u22121 rb1\u22121 )k\n\n= rb2\n\nwhere we have written rb1 for rbs1 and rb2 for rbs2 to avaoid an notational overload.\nIn turn, this implies\n(b\nr1 rb2 )m(br1 ,br2 )\n\n= 1.\n\nThe case m(s1 , s2 ) odd is similar and is left to the reader.\nb and need to prove that \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 is the identity\nSo we have the map \u03c8 : W \u2192 W\nb It is clear that it is the identity on S,\nb so we need to show that Sb generates\non W.\nb We do this by proving that the subgroup hSi\nb generated by Sb contains\nb of W\nW.\nb\nthe set T := {b\nrt : t \u2208 T }.\nSo let rbt \u2208 Tb. this means t = wsw\u22121 for some w \u2208 W and s \u2208 S. The group\nelement w can be written as w = s1 s2 * * * sk for some s1 , s2 , . . . , sk \u2208 S.

By the previous proposition, they have a presentation by conjugation.\n(ii) The underlying root set of a locally finite root system described in the\nintroduction in c) has the presentation by conjugation (see [LN04] Theorem 5.12).\n\n\f3 THE PRESENTATION BY CONJUGATION\n\n8\n\nDefinition 3.4 Let R be a root set with Weyl group W.

This result is need in the proof of one of\nour main theorems.\nProposition 4.7 Let \u03b1 \u2208 V and \u03b1\u0307 \u2208 \u1e58 with \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307 \u2208 V0 .

To prove that a set is an orbit of a group, two things need to be proved:\nThe set is invariant under the group and the group acts transitively on the set.\nFor invariance we suppose that \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307 + \u1e87.\u03b1\u0307 + \u03c4 is an element of the set on\nthe right side of (17), i.e. \u1e87 \u2208 \u1e86 and \u03c4 \u2208 T . Let \u03b2 \u2208 R. Then it can be written\nas \u03b2 = \u03b2\u0307 + \u03c3 with \u03b2\u0307 \u2208 \u1e58 and \u03c3 \u2208 V0 .\n\u2208V0\n\nz }| {\nr\u03b2\u0307+\u03c3 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307 +\u1e87.\u03b1\u0307 + \u03c4 )\n\n=\n\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307 + \u1e87.\u03b1\u0307 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u1e87.\u03b1\u0307, \u03b2\u0307 \u2228 )(\u03b2\u0307 + \u03c3)\n\n=\n\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307 + r\u03b2\u0307 \u1e87.\u03b1\u0307 + |{z}\n\u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b1\u0307, \u1e87\u22121 .\u03b2\u0307 \u2228 )\u03c3\n{z\n}\n|\n| {z } \u2208T\n\u2208\u1e86.\u03b1\u0307\n\n\u2208T\n\nThus, since W is generated by the reflections associated to the roots, the right\nhand side of (17) is invariant under W.\nNow we prove that W acts transitively on this set. It suffices to show that\nfor any \u03c4 \u2208 T , any \u03b2\u0307 \u2208 \u1e58\u00d7 and any \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b2\u0307 = {\u03c1 \u2208 V0 : \u03b2\u0307 + \u03c1 \u2208 R} there is a\nw \u2208 W such that\nw.(\u03b1 + \u03c4 ) = \u03b1 + \u03c4 + (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2228 )\u03c3.\n\n\f4 EXTENDED AFFINE ROOT SYSTEMS\n\nWe have\nr\u03b2\u0307 r\u03b2\u0307\u2212\u03c3 .(\u03b1 + \u03c4 )\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n16\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nr\u03b2\u0307 \u03b1 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b1\u0307, \u03b2\u0307 \u2228 )(\u03b2\u0307 \u2212 \u03c3)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nr\u03b2\u0307 r\u03b2\u0307 .\u03b1 + \u03c4 + (\u03b1\u0307, \u03b2\u0307 \u2228 )\u03c3\n\u03b1 + \u03c4 + (\u03b1\u0307, \u03b2\u0307 \u2228 )\u03c3\n\nThis concludes the proof.\nDefinition 4.8 Let R\u00d7 be a subset of V. Then the set\n\u0001\nIRC(R\u00d7 ) := (R\u00d7 \u2212 R\u00d7 ) \u2229 V0 \u222a R\u00d7\nis called the isotropic root closure.\n\nLemma 4.9 If R is an EARS and R\u00d7 is the set of its anisotropic roots then\nIRC(R\u00d7 ) = R.\nProof. The inclusion \u0001\u2287 follows from axiom (R6). For the converse inclusion\nlet \u03c3 \u2208 (R\u00d7 \u2212 R\u00d7 ) \u2229 V . So there are \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2208 R\u00d7 with \u03c3 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2208 V0 . This\nimplies (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u03b1, \u03b1) > 0. So by (R6) the set {\u03b2 + n\u03b1 : n \u2208 Z} \u2229 R contains\n(\u03b1,\u03b2)\n\u03c3 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1, since d = 2 (\u03b1,\u03b2)\n+ u > u \u2265 0. This implies \u03c3 \u2208 R, and we are done.\n\nDefinition 4.10 An EARS R is called minimal if the root set R\u00d7 for the Weyl\ngroup W is a minimal.\nExample 4.11 Consider the real vector\nthe bilinear form h*, *i with matrix\n\uf8eb\n0 0\n\uf8ed0 1\n1 0\n\nspace V := R7 = R3 \u00d7 R \u00d7 R3 with\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\nwith respect to the decomposition V := R7 = R3 \u00d7 R \u00d7 R3 . So 1 stands for the\n3\u00d73-identity matrix. In V we consider the set\nR\u00d7\n\n:=\n\nZ3 \u00d7 {\u22121, 1} \u00d7 {0}3.\n\nThis is the set of anisotropic roots of the EARS IRC(R\u00d7 ) of type A1 with nullity\n3. Let W be the Weyl group of this EARS.\nSet\n\u03b3 := (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)T \u2208 R\u00d7 .\nRecall the definition of R\u03b3\u00d7 from (6). Then\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\nR\u03b3\u00d7 = R\u00d7 \\ {\u2212\u03b3, \u03b3} + (2Z)3 \u00d7 {0}4\n=\n\n{(zi )7i=1 \u2208 R\u00d7 : z1 z2 z3 even}\n\n\f17\n\n4 EXTENDED AFFINE ROOT SYSTEMS\n\nand this is the set of anisotropic roots of an EARS of type A1 with nullity 3.\nWe will show that the reflections associated to R\u03b3\u00d7 generate W, which means\nthat R as not a minimal EARS. This can be done by realizing that \u03b3 is a socalled ghost root for the EARS IRC(R\u03b3\u00d7 ) (see [Hof04] Example 4.4.83). Or it\ncan be done by a making direct computation. For this purpose let the roots\n\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b16 \u2208 R\u03b3 be given by the columns of the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n1 0 \u22121 0 \u22121 0\n\uf8ec\u22121 0 0 1 \u22121 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u22121 \u22121 1 0\n0\n0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec1\n1 1 1\n1\n1 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0\n0 0 0\n0\n0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed0\n0 0 0\n0\n0 0\uf8f8\n0\n0 0 0\n0\n0 0\nwith respect to the standard basis. Then a direct computation shows that\nr\u03b3 = r\u03b10 r\u03b11 r\u03b12 r\u03b13 r\u03b14 r\u03b15 r\u03b16 .\nThis implies that the reflection associated to R\u03b3\u00d7 generate W.\nIn the proof of the next theorem we will need to handle EARS of type BCl\nwith special care. They are best dealt with by trimming them into an EARS of\nreduced type. This motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4.12 Let R be an EARS of non-reduced type, i.e. of type BCl ,\nl \u2265 1. We set\ntrim(R)\n\n1\n= IRC(Rsh \u222a Rlg \u222a Rex )\n2\n\nand call trim(R) the trimmed root system of R.\nThe following result justifies this terminology.\nLemma 4.13\n\n(i) The set trim(R) is an EARS of type Bl .\n\n(ii) The root system trim(R) has the same Weyl group as R.\nb (see (4)) as R.

This is type Bl .\nItem (ii) follows from the fact that the two Weyl groups have the same\ngenerating set and (iii) and (iv) follow from the one-to-one correspondence of\norbits of the Weyl group in R and trim(R).\nTheorem 4.14 Let R be an EARS and let W be its Weyl group. Then W has\na presentation by conjugation with respect to R if and only if R is minimal.\nProof. Let R be an EARS and let W be its Weyl group. In view of Lemma 4.13,\nwe may assume that R is of reduced type.\nIn [Aza99] a subset R\u03a0 of R is introduced which is also an EARS (See\nProposition 4.12 of [Aza99]). Furthermore it is proven that the Weyl group W\u03a0\nof that root system R\u03a0 has a presentation by conjugation (See Theorem 5.15 of\n[Aza99]). If we prove that\n(\u2200w \u2208 W) (\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 R\u00d7 ) (\u2203w\u2032 \u2208 WR\u03a0 ) w.\u03b1 = w\u2032 .\u03b1\nthen we are done by Proposition 3.9.\n\n(19)\n\n\f19\n\n4 EXTENDED AFFINE ROOT SYSTEMS\n\nDue to Proposition 4.41 and Equation (4.16) in [Aza99] we only need to\nconsider EARSs R of type X = A1 , X = Bl (l \u2265 2) and X = Cl (l \u2265 3).\nAccording to [Aza99] (4.11), if we have\nR =\nR\u03a0\n\nS + S) \u222a (\u1e58sh + S) \u222a (\u1e58lg + L) then\n\u0001\nS\u03a0 + S\u03a0 \u222a (\u1e58sh + S\u03a0 ) \u222a (\u1e58lg + L\u03a0 ) with\nhS\u03a0 i = hSi and hL\u03a0 i = hLi\n\n=\n\nIn view of Proposition 4.7 this means that the two Weyl groups W and W\u03a0 have\nthe same orbits in R\u00d7 . This entails our requirement in (19).\nThe following characterization of EARSs will be usefull when we need to\nidentify certain subsets of EARSs as EARSs.\nProposition 4.15 Let R\u00d7 be a set of anisotropic vectors in V such that\n(i) WR\u00d7 .R\u00d7 \u2286 R\u00d7 ,\n(ii) R\u00d7 is an irreducible finite root system,\n(iii) hR\u00d7 i is a lattice in V,\n(iv) \u03b1 \u2208 R\u00d7 implies 2\u03b1 \u2208\n/ R\u00d7 .\nThen R := IRC(R\u00d7 ) is the EARS having R\u00d7 as its set of anisotropic roots.\nProof. We need to verify the axioms (R1) - (R8). Axiom (R1) follows from\nthe definition of IRC(R\u00d7 ). Due to the fact that r\u03b3 .\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b3 for every \u03b3 \u2208 R\u00d7 we\nhave \u2212R\u00d7 = R\u00d7 . By the definition of IRC(R\u00d7 ), this implies (R2). Item (iii)\nimplies (R3) and (iv) implies (R4). Since R is contained in hR\u00d7 i, it is discrete,\nso (R5) is satisfied. Since \u1e58\u00d7 is irreducible (R7) holds. Axiom (R8) follows\nfrom the definition of IRC(R\u00d7 ).\nThe only axiom remaining to be proved is (R6). So let \u03b1 \u2208 R\u00d7 and \u03b2 \u2208 R.\nWe will look at three different cases.\nCase \u03b1 and \u03b2 linearly independent: Then let W\u03b1,\u03b2 be the subgroup of W\ngenerated by \u03b1 and \u03b2.

So we need to verify conditions (i) Proof. We use Proposition 4.15 for R\n(iv) of that proposition. Conditions (i), and (iv) are evident so first we focus on\nf\u00d7 i follows from the fact that hRt imesi is discret. (This\n(iii).

This means that U is invariant under WR\ng\n\u00d7 and thus\nalso under WR\u00d7 . That is a contradiction to axiom (R7) for the EARS R.\nNow we verify (ii). The group WR\u00d7 obtained by reducing the elements of\nthe group WR\u00d7 to automorphisms of Aut(V/V0 ) is the same as the subgroup\nWR\u00d7 of Aut(V/V0 ) generated by the reflections associated to the roots in R\u00d7 .\nSo by hypothesis we have\nWR\u00d7 = Wg\u00d7\nR\n\nf\u00d7 is an irreducible finite crystallographic root sysBy Lemma 3.8, the set R\ne follow from this lemma, as well.\ntem.

When passing from\nR to R\u2032 only the following changes in type are possible:\nBC1 \u2192 A1 , BC2 \u2192 B2 , BCl \u2192 Bl , BCl \u2192 Cl , where l \u2265 3.\nProof. Due to Proposition 4.7 the Weyl group W of R has only a finite number\nof orbits in R. So Lemma 4.16 can be applied repeatedly until a minimal EARS\nR\u2032 \u2286 R is obtained. The only possible changes in type are those indicated in\nLemma 4.16.\nIt is tempting to think that an EARS contained in a minimal EARS is\nminimal. But this is not necessarily the case, as the following example reveals:\nExample 4.18 Let R be a minimal EARS of type A1 and nullity 3. (Such an\nEARS exists by Theorem 4.5 and Theorem 4.17. If R is given by\nR = (S + S) \u222a (\u1e58sh + S)\nthen the set\nR = (S \u2032 + S \u2032 ) \u222a (\u1e58sh + S \u2032 ) with\n\nS \u2032 = 2hSi\n\nis an EARS contained in R by Theorem 4.5. Since this EARS is isomorphic to\nthe EARS R discussed in Example 4.11, it is not minimal.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n22\n\nThe statements of Theorem 4.14 and Theorem 4.17 taken together imply:\nTheorem 4.19 Every EAWeG W has the presentation by conjugation with respect to some EARS.\n\nReferences\n[AAB+ 97] Bruce N.
