Our method is to describe the this\nnumber purely in terms of the Gromov invariants of the Grassmannian and\nthen use the formula of Vafa and Intriligator to compute them.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet C be a smooth projective curve over C of genus g \u2265 2. For a vector bundle\nof rank r and degree d the s-invariant is defined by sk (E) = d k \u2212 r emax (E) where\nemax (E) = Max{deg(F )}. Here the maximum is taken over all subbundles F of E\nof rank k. It is known that for any E the s-invariant satisfies sk (E) \u2264 k(r \u2212 k)g\n(see the results of Mukai-Sakai [13]).\nOne can get a more specific bound when we put additional structures on the bundle\nE. It is proved by Hirschowitz [7] that for a general stable bundle the invariant sk (E)\nis independent of the choice of E and satisfies smin,d = sk (E) = k(r \u2212 k)(g \u2212 1) + \u01eb\nwhere \u01eb is the unique integer 0 \u2264 \u01eb < r such that smin,d = kd(mod r). Moreover if\nemax,d is the degree of a maximal subbundle of a general stable bundle E of degree\nd then every component of the quot scheme Quotk,emax,d (E) of rank k subsheaves\nof degree emax,d has dimension \u01eb. And if the bundle is sufficiently general then the\nabove quot scheme is itself smooth (see Lemma 2.1, Lange-Newstead [12] when the\nquot scheme is zero dimensional and in general see Remark 6.6, [8]). Hence when\nsmin(d) = k(r \u2212 k)(g \u2212 1) we have a zero dimensional quot scheme which is smooth.\nThis defines the number m(r, d, k, g) as the number of maximal subbundles of a\nsufficiently stable bundle E.\nIt is known that m(r, d, 1, g) = r g (see Ghione [6], Lange [11], and Segre [17] for\nr = 2 and Okonek-Teleman [14] and Oxbury [15], Theorem 3.1, in general). For the\ncase when k > 1 there is a formula to compute m(r, d, k, g) when k and emax,d are\nrelatively prime (see Lange-Newstead [12]).\n1\n\n\fOur objective in this paper is to compute the number m(r, d, k, g) explicitly for\nall choices of parameters (see Theorem 4.4). We first define a notion of a twisted\nGromov invariants for any vector bundle following the methods of Bertram [2]. The\nmain tool this uses is the fact the quot schemes of our interested are generically\nsmooth of expected dimension. This is the case when se = d k \u2212 r e is sufficiently\nlarge. But if the bundle E is sufficiently general then for all values of e for which\nthe quot scheme Quotk,e (E) is non-empty it does satisfy the above property. This\nenable us to define the twisted Gromov invariants for all choices of e \u2264 emax (d). We\nthen see that the numbers m(r, d, k, g) can be computed purely in terms of these\ntwisted Gromov invariants. These invariants were also defined in [14] and Behrend\n[1].\nWe show that these invariants are actually independent of the chosen general stable\nbundle. Also if se is large enough then these invariants do not depend on the choice\nof the vector bundle of degree d. Then using Hecke transformations we compare the\ntwisted Gromov invariants for different choices of d. These ideas will now enable us\nto compute the twisted Gromov invariants purely in terms of the Gromov invariants\nof the Grassmannian (when E is trivial). And in this case there is a formula of Vafa\nand Intriligator (see [19], [9], and for proof see Bertram [2] and [3]) which exactly\ncomputes these invariants.\nOne observes that our formula for m(r, d, k, g) and the one obtained in [12] are completely different in appearence. It will be interesting to compare the two expressions\ndirectly.\nSome of these results can also be generalized to G-bundles for a connected reductive\nalgebraic group G and this will be done elsewhere.\nacknowledgment We wish to thank G. Harder and M. S. Narasimhan who initiated\nhim into this problem.

In this section we define the twisted\nGromov invariants for a vector bundle E of rank r and degree d, and a positive\ninteger k \u2264 r. Our view point here is that the construction of Gromov invariants\ngiven in Bertram [2] holds for any vector bundle.\nLet E be a vector bundle of rank r and degree d over C. We will be mostly be\ninterested in the quot scheme Quotk,e (E) parameterizing the rank k subsheaves of\ndegree e. We have an open subscheme Quotk,e\n0 (E) consisting of subbundles. We\nneed some basic facts about these quot schemes which will be used in the sequel.\nWe will denote by se = d k \u2212 r e. First we consider the case k = 1. Let emax (E)\nbe the degree of the maximal line subbundle of E. We have natural morphisms\nie1 : C(e1 \u2212e) \u00d7 Quot1,e1 (E) \u2192 Quot1,e (E) for each e < e1 \u2264 emax which takes the pair\n(D, [L \u0592\u2192 E]) to [L(\u2212D) \u0592\u2192 L \u0592\u2192 E]. Using the universal properties of the quot\n2\n\n\fschemes we check that this defines a morphism.\nLemma 2.1 The morphism ie1 is a closed embedding. Moreover For e \u2264 e1 , e2 \u2264\nemax with e1 6= e2 , we have\nie1 (C(e1 \u2212e) \u00d7 Quot01,e1 (E)) \u2229 ie2 (C(e2 \u2212e) \u00d7 Quot01,e2 (E)) = \u2205.\nProof If [L \u2192 E] defines an element of Quot1,e (E) which is in image of ie1 then we\n\u2032\ncan uniquely recover an effective divisor D \u2032 and an element [L\u2032 \u0592\u2192 E] \u2208 Quot01,e (E)\nfor some e\u2032 \u2265 e using the fact that L\u2032 is the saturation of L in E and D is the divisor\ndefined by the inclusion L \u0592\u2192 L\u2032 . This fact already implies that the restriction of the\nmorphism ie2 to C(e2 \u2212e) \u00d7Quot01,e2 (E) is injective. Now ie1 (D1 , [L1 \u0592\u2192 E]) = [L \u0592\u2192 E]\nif and only if the inclusion L \u0592\u2192 L\u2032 factors via L \u0592\u2192 L1 up to an isomorphism of L.\nHence we see that the element defined by L1 \u0592\u2192 E in Quot01,e1 (E) is in the image\n\u2032\nof corresponding morphism C(e\u2032 \u2212e1 ) \u00d7 Quot01,e (E) \u2212\u2192 Quot1,e1 (E). This proves the\nsecond assertions of the lemma.\n\u0003\nThe above lemma defines a stratification on Quot1,e (E) by locally closed subschemes\nC(e1 \u2212e) \u00d7 Quot1,e1 (E), where e \u2264 e1 \u2264 emax and for e1 = e we get an open strata\nQuot1,e\n0 (E). Note that this stratification is in some sense weak as these quot schemes\nare not equidimensional and there can be stratas with e1 > e which might contain\nopen subschemes of Quot1,e (E).\nNow we use the above lemma to get a similar understanding of the structure of\nQuotk,e (E) for k > 1. For any subsheaf F \u0592\u2192 E of rank k we can take the k-th\nV\nV\nexterior power to get a line subsheaf Vk (F ) \u0592\u2192 k (E). This defines the Pl\u00fccker\nmorphism Pe : Quotk,e (E) \u2192 Quot1,e ( k (E)). Again it is easy to check that this\nmorphism restricted to Quotk,e\n0 (E) is an embedding. We have the following lemma\nwhich describes the boundary of Quotk,e (E) in terms of the stratification defined\nabove.\n`\nLemma 2.2 The scheme Quotk,e (E) has a stratification Quotk,e\n0 (E)\ne\u2264e1 \u2264emax Be1\n1,e1 Vk\n\u22121\nwhere Be1 = Pe (C(e1 \u2212e) \u00d7 Quot0 ( (E))). Moreover the image of the morphism\n1\nPe when restricted to Be1 is exactly Ce1 \u2212e \u00d7Pe1 (Quotk,e\n0 (E))) and the fibers of pr2 \u25e6Pe\nwhen restricted to Be1 are irreducible and smooth of dimension k(e \u2212 e1 ).\nProof The first assertion in the Lemma follows from the definition. The second\nfollows from the fact that if F \u0592\u2192 E is a rank k subsheaf of E then the saturation\nV\nV\nF sat of F in E has the property that k (F sat ) is the saturation of k (F ). For\nthe last part one observes that the fiber of the morphism pr2 \u25e6 Pe |Be1 at the point\n[F \u0592\u2192 E] is the quot scheme Quotk,e1\u2212e (F ) of length e1 \u2212 e quotients Quotk,e1 \u2212e (F )\nand this space is irreducible and smooth of dimension k(e1 \u2212 e).\n\u0003\nRemark 2.3 The above lemma also gives us the following dimension estimate\nk,e\n1\ndim(Quotk,e\n0 (E)) \u2264 dim(Quot (E)) \u2212 k(e1 \u2212 e).\n\n3\n\n\fThis estimate is also proved in Popa-Roth [16]. It will be used to define the well\ndefinedness of the twisted Gromov invariants.\nRemark 2.4 If Q is an irreducible component of the quot scheme Quotk,e (E) such\nthat every element in Q corresponds to a quotient of E which is not locally free then\nthere exists an e1 \u2265 e such that Be1 is actually dense open subset of Q.This has the\n1\neffect that we obtain a dimension bound dim(Q) \u2264 Quotk,e\n0 (E) + k(e1 \u2212 e). This\nestimate will also be used later.\nLet x \u2208 C be a point. We will denote by E(x) the fiber of E at x. Let Grk (E(x))\ndenote the Grassmannian of k dimensional subspaces of E(x). Hence we have the\nuniversal rank k subbundle S(x) \u2192 E(x) \u2297 OGrk (E(x)) . There is a natural action of\nthe general linear group GL(E(x)) of automorphisms of E(x) on Grk (E(x)). Let\nH \u2282 E(x)\u2217 be a subspace of dimension n \u2264 k. We then have a special Schubert\nvariety YH defined by the degeneracy locus of the canonical map H \u2297 OGrk (E(x)) \u2192\nS(x)\u2217 . The variety YH is irreducible and reduced of codimension k + 1 \u2212 n and it\nrepresents the (k +1\u2212n)-th Chern class of S(x)\u2217 . For any element g \u2208 GL(E(x)) we\nhave a g translate of YH defined by the degeneracy locus associated to the translate\ngH.\nFor a Schubert variety YH associated to H we define the generalized Schubert scheme\nWe (x, H) = evx\u22121 (YH ), where evx is the evaluation map Quotk,e\n0 (E) \u2192 Grk (E(x)) at\nx which takes an element [F \u0592\u2192 E] to the subspace F (x) \u0592\u2192 E(x).\nWe need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.5 Given a vector bundle E of rank r over C there is an integer s(E) such\nthat for each e with se \u2265 s(E), every component of the the quot scheme Quotk,e (E) is\ngenerically smooth of expected dimension and a general element in every component\ncorresponds to a subbundle of E.\nProof This is proved in Popa-Roth [16], Theorem 5.14. In fact they prove a\nstronger version namely that there is an integer s1 (E) such that for each e with\nse \u2265 s1 (E) the quot scheme Quotk,e (E) is also irreducible.\n\u0003\nThe above lemma allows us to define the invariant s(E) (namely minimal such\ninteger satisfying the above lemma) for any vector bundle.\nNow we define the twisted Gromov invariants as the intersection numbers in the quot\nscheme. Let e be such that se \u2265 s(E). Let (x, H) be a pair with x \u2208 C and H a\nsubspace of E(x)\u2217 of rank n \u2264 k. We define the subscheme Ve (x, H) \u2282 Quotk,e (E) as\nthe the degeneracy locus of the composite morphism H \u2297OQuotk,e (E) \u2192 (pr\u22171 E)(x) \u2192\nF \u2217 (x), where (F \u2217 )(x) is the restriction of the dual of the universal subsheaf F \u2282\npr\u22171 E of rank k and degree e to {x} \u00d7 Quotk,e (E) and pr1 : C \u00d7 Quotk,e (E) \u2192 C\nis the first projection. By definitions we can check that We (x, H) is the scheme\ntheoretic intersection of Ve (x, H) and Quotk,e\n0 (E).\n\n4\n\n\fLemma 2.6 With the notations above if g \u2208 GLx (E) general then every component of Ve (x, gH) has codimension exactly k \u2212 n + 1 in Quotk,e (E) and Ve (x, gH)\nrepresents the (k \u2212 n + 1)-th Chern class of F \u2217 (x).\nProof Firstly the conditions se \u2265 s(E) ensures that the quot scheme Quotk,e (E)\nhas the properties mentioned in the Lemma 2.5 This has the effect that the above\nquot scheme is locally of complete intersection hence Cohen-Macaulay (see for example K\u00f6llar, I, Theorem 5.17, [10]). Hence the subscheme Ve (x, H) represents the\nk \u2212n+1-th Chern class of F \u2217 (x) if we show that the codimension of every irreducible\ncomponent of Ve (x, H) is k \u2212 n + 1 (see Fulton, Theorem 14.3, Fulton [5]). Now we\nuse the Lemma 2.2 Lemma 2.5 we can continue as in the proof of the first part of\nthe Theorem 1.4 of [2] to check the codimensionality condition.\n\u0003\nThe above lemma allows us to define the twisted Gromov invariants as follows.\nLet E be a rank r and degree d vector bundle over C. Let s(E) be as defined in\nLemma 2.5. Let X1 , . . . , Xk be weighted variables such that weight of Xi is i. Let\nP (X1 , . . . , Xk ) be a homogeneous polynomial of weighted degree se + k(r \u2212k)(1 \u2212g)\nwith se = d k \u2212 r e and se \u2265 s(E).\nDefinition 2.7 We define the twisted Gromov invariant Nd,e (P (X1, . . . , Xk ), E)\nfor a vector bundle E, and an integer e such that se > s(E), as the intersection\nnumber\nP (c1 (F \u2217 (x), . . . , ck (F \u2217(x))[Quotk,e (E)]\nHere [Quotk,e (E)] denotes the fundamental cycle.\nRemark 2.8 The above number is independent of the single point x chosen. More\ngenerally we could choose points xi for i = 1, . . . , n and subspaces Hi \u2282 E(xi )\u2217\nP\nof dimension ai \u2264 k such that i (k \u2212 ai + 1) = se + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g) then the\nnumber Nd,e (\u03a0ni=1 Xk\u2212ai +1 , E) can be exactly computed as the intersection number\n\u2229Ve (xi , gi Hi ) for general elements gi \u2208 GL(E(xi )).\nThe following proposition shows how to compute the above intersection as an intersection in the open subscheme Quotk,e\n0 (E).\nProposition 2.9 Let E be a rank r vector bundle of degree d and let e be such\nthat se \u2265 s(E). For i = 1, . . . , N, let xi \u2208 C be distinct points and Hi \u2282\nP\nE \u2217 (xi ) be subspaces of dimension ai \u2264 k such that N\ni=1 (k \u2212 ai + 1) = se + k(r \u2212\nk)(1 \u2212 g). Then for general choices of gi \u2208 GL(E(xi )), the twisted Gromov invariants Nd,e (\u03a0N\ni=1 Xk\u2212ai +1 , E) can be exactly computed as the number of intersections\nN\n\u2229i=1 We (xi , gi Hi ) (counted with multiplicities).\nProof The proof of the proposition exactly follows second part of the proof of\nTheorem 1.4 of [2]. Here we can use the dimension bound obtained in the Remark\n5\n\n\f2.3 to ensure that for general translates the intersections in the boundary are trivial\nfor any choice of e such that se \u2265 s(E).\n\u0003\nNow we compare the intersection numbers obtained in the above theorem for different rank r vector bundles of a fixed degree d.\nLet E1 and E2 be two rank r vector bundles over C of degree d. It can be proved\nusing the smoothness and irreducibility of the moduli stack bundles of rank r and\ndegree d that there is a smooth irreducible variety B, a family of bundles E over\nC \u00d7 B and two points x1 and x2 of B such that E|C\u00d7xi \u223c\n= Ei for i = 1, 2. We will\ndenote by Ex the bundle E|C\u00d7x for x \u2208 B. We need the following generalization of\nthe Lemma 2.5.\nLemma 2.10 There exists an integer sE independent of x \u2208 B such that for all\ns \u2265 sE the quot scheme Quotk,e (Ex ) is generically smooth of expected dimension\nand satisfies the property that general elements in every irreducible component of\nQuotk,e (Ex ) lies in Quotk,e\n0 (Ex )\nProof The lemma follows from the arguments similar to the proof of Theorem\n6.4 of [16] once we establish the existence of an integer sE independent of x \u2208 B\nsuch that Quotk,e\n0 (Ex ) is generically smooth of expected dimension for all e with\nse \u2265 sE . The last statement can be again proved by going through the arguments\nof Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 6.2 of [16] (Also see Proposition 5.11, [8] where the\n\u0003\ninteger sE is described in terms of instability degree of a principal bundle).\nWe can use the above Lemma to define the invariant sE (namely minimal such integer\nsatisfying the above lemma) for a family of vector bundles E over C \u00d7 B.\nProposition 2.11 If E is a family of rank r vector bundles of degree d on C \u00d7 B1\nwith B1 being a smooth curve and e is chosen such that se \u2265 sE then the Gromov\ninvariants Nd,e (P (X1, . . . , Xk ), Ex ) are independent of the choice of points x \u2208 B.\nProof We consider the relative Quot scheme f : Quotk,e (E) \u2192 B1 which has the\nproperty that for each x \u2208 B1 the fiber is exactly Quotk,e (Ex ). If se \u2265 sE then\nby Lemma 2.10 we see that each of Quotk,e (Ex ) are generically smooth of expected\ndimension. Hence f is a locally complete intersection morphism (see I, Theorem\n5.17, [10]), in particular flat. Now the proposition follows from Lemma 1.6 of [2]. \u0003\nThe above proof can also be used to show that the intersection numbers are actually\ndepend on only the genus g of the smooth projective curve C (for the case of trivial\nbundles, this is the Proposition 1.5 [2]).\nWe also have a simple relation between the twisted Gromov invariants when the\nvector bundle is tensored with a line bundle.\nLemma 2.12 Let E be a rank r vector bundle of degree d and L, a line bundle of\ndegree d1 . Then we have s(E) = s(E \u2297 L) and the twisted Gromov invariants of E\n6\n\n\fand E \u2297 L are related by the following\nNd+rd1 ,e+kd1 (P (X1 , . . . , Xk ), E \u2297 L) = Nd,e (P (X1, . . . , Xk ), E).\nProof This follows from the fact that the quot schemes Quotk,e+kd1 (E \u2297 L) and\nQuotk,e (E) are naturally isomorphic and the isomorphism preserves the all the degeneracy loci.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nGenerically stable bundles\n\nIn this section we will assume that C is a smooth projective curve over C of genus\ng \u2265 2.\nwe first prove some basic facts about the structure of the quot schemes for generically\nstable bundles and these fact will be used later.\nWe first begin by the following result which will enable us to define twisted Gromov\ninvariants when the degrees of the subbundles is not very small. Let M s (r, d) denote\nthe coarse moduli space of stable bundles of rank r and degree d. Let 0 < k < r. For\na vector bundle E over C of rank r and degree d, recall the notion of the s invariant\nby sk (E) = d k \u2212 r emax (E) where emax = Max{deg(F )}. Here the maximum is\ntaken over all rank k subbundles F of E. It is known that if the vector bundle E\nis generically stable then smin,d = sk (E) = k(r \u2212 k)(g \u2212 1) + \u01eb where \u01eb is the unique\ninteger with 0 \u2264 \u01eb \u2264 r \u2212 1 such that s = k d(mod r). Let emax,d be the degree of the\nmaximal subbundle of a generically stable bundle of degree d.\nProposition 3.1 There exists a non empty open subset U(r, d) \u2282 M(r, d) with the\nproperty that for each E \u2208 U(r, d) and for every e \u2264 emax,d , every component of\nquot scheme Quotk,e (E) is generically smooth of expected dimension (= d k \u2212 r e +\nk(r \u2212 1)(g \u2212 1)) and satisfies the property that general elements in every irreducible\ncomponent corresponds to subbundles of E.\nProof It is already known that there is a non empty open subset U(r, d) of M(r, d)\nsuch that each E in U(r, d) satisfies smin,d = sk (E) = d k \u2212r emax,d and the dimension\nestimate dim(Quotk,e (E)) \u2264 se + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g) holds for all e \u2264 emax (see Example\n5.4 [16]). This along with the deformation theoretic lower bounds implies that\nevery component of the quot scheme has the above dimension. Moreover it is also\nknown that every irreducible component of Quotk,e\n0 (E) is generically smooth (see for\nexample Proposition 6.8, [8]). So we only have to only make sure that these quot\nschemes have no pathological components. Let Q be an irreducible component of\nQuotk,e (E) such that every element in Q corresponds to quotient which is not torsion\n1\nfree. Then by Remark 2.4 there is an e1 > e such that dim(Q) \u2264 dim(Quotk,e\n0 (E))+\nk(e1 \u2212e). Now this leads to a contradiction once we put the values of the dimensions\nof these spaces.\n\u0003\n7\n\n\fThe above result shows that if E \u2208 U(r, d) then s(E) = smin,d . This enables us to\ndefine the twisted Gromov invariant Nd,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xk ), E) for all possible values of\ne \u2264 emax,d . Moreover if we stay in the open subset U(r, d) then we see by Proposition\n2.11 that these numbers are actually independent of the choice of E \u2208 U(r, d). This\nenable us to define Nd,e (P (X1, . . . , Xn )) to be Nd,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xn ), E) for some\nE \u2208 U(r, d) and e with e \u2264 emax,d .\nAlso the Proposition 2.11 shows that if E1 is any vector bundle of rank r and degree\nd then for any e with se \u2265 s(E1 ) we have\nNd,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xn )) = Nd,e (P (X1, . . . , Xn ), E1 ).\nNow we will compare the above invariants when the degree of the vector bundle\nchanges. The main result is the following.\nProposition 3.2 For a polynomial P (X1 , . . . , Xk ) of weighted degree se + k(r \u2212\nk)(g \u2212 1) \u2212 k with e satisfying e \u2264 emax,d\u22121 We have\nNd\u22121,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xk )) = Nd,e (Xk P (X1 , . . . , Xk ))\nWe first recall a basic lemma which will be a step in the proof of the above result.\nLet x \u2208 C be a point fixed. For a bundle E of rank r and degree d and a quotient\nspace l : E(x) \u2192 C (or equivalently a line l \u2282 E \u2217 (x)) of dimension 1 at a point x\nwe have the Hecke transform Fl = ker(e\nl), where e\nl is the map E \u2192 C defined by l.\nThen the degree of Fl is equal to d \u2212 1. Hence for any point g \u2208 GL(E(x)) we have\na vector bundle Fgl defined by the above procedure.\nLemma 3.3 For any two non-empty open sets U \u2282 M s (r, d) and U1 \u2282 M s (r, d \u2212 1)\nthere exists a vector bundle E \u2208 U and a non empty open set V \u2282 GL(E(x)) such\nthat for each g \u2208 V the vector bundle Fgl got by Hecke transform with respect to gl\nlies in U1 .\nProof Let Vect(r, d) denote the moduli stack of vector bundles of rank r and degree\nd. We have the Hecke stack H defined by triples (F, E, i) where F and E are rank r\nbundles of degree d \u2212 1 and d respectively and an inclusion i : F \u2264 E whose cokernel\nis supported at a single point x. We also have two morphisms h1 : H \u2192 Vect(r, d\u22121)\nand h2 : H \u2192 Vect(r, d) which takes such a triple to F and E respectively. It is easy\nto check that these two morphisms are surjective. Now the stack H is irreducible\nas is a projective bundle over Vect(r, d), which is irreducible, whose fiber at E is\ngiven by Grm (E(x)). Since M s (r, d) and M s (r, d \u2212 1) are the coarse moduli spaces\nof open substack of Vect(r, d) and Vect(r, d \u2212 1) respectively, hence we can check\nthat the inverse images of the open sets U and U1 under the morphism h1 and h2\nrespectively intersect in a non empty open substack of H. This proves the lemma.\n\u0003\n8\n\n\fNow we return to the proof of the Proposition 3.2. Let x \u2208 C be a fixed point.\nChoose a vector bundle E \u2208 U(r, d) prescribed by the Lemma 3.3 for the open\nsubsets U1 = U(r, d \u2212 1) and U = U(r, d). We then obtain a non empty open subset\nV \u2282 GL(E(x)) such that for each g \u2208 V the bundle Fgl lies in U1 . Let x1 , . . . , xN\nbe distinct points of the curve C which are also distinct from x and Hi \u2282 E \u2217 (Xi )\nP\nbe subspaces of rank ai \u2264 k such that N\ni=1 (k \u2212 ai + 1) = se + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g) \u2212 k.\nThen by Proposition 2.11 the twisted Gromov invariant Nd,e (Xk \u03a0li=1 Xk\u2212ai +1 , E) can\nT\nbe exactly computed as the number of intersections V (x, gl) N\ni=1 Ve (xi , gi Hi ) for\ngeneral elements of gi 's and g, where Ve (xi , gi Hi ) (and V (x, gl)) are the degeneracy\nloci in Quotk,e (E) associated to Hi (and l).\nWe have a natural morphism f : Quotk,e (Fgl ) \u2192 Quotk,e (E) which takes [H \u0592\u2192 Fgl ]\nto [H \u0592\u2192 Fgl \u0592\u2192 E]. This morphism can be checked to be an embedding.\nNow we check by definitions that the degeneracy locus V (x, gl) is exactly the isomorphic image of f and for each i the scheme f \u22121 Ve (xi , gi Hi ) is exactly the degeneracy\nlocus associated to Fgl for the subspace gHi \u2282 Fgl\u2217 (xi ) Hence for general gi and g\nthere is a natural isomorphism between the the zero dimensional schemes\n\u223c N \u22121 (Ve (xi , gi Hi )).\nV (x, gl) \u2229N\ni=1 Ve (xi , gi Hi ) = \u2229i=1 f\nHence by Proposition 2.9 we see that the left hand side of the above isomorphism\ncomputes the twisted Gromov invariants for E and the right hand side of the of the\nabove isomorphism computes the twisted Gromov invariants for Fgl . This completes\nthe proof of the Proposition 3.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4 the last part of the proof of the above proposition also follows from\nthe excess intersection formula (see Fulton, Theorem 6.3 and Proposition 6.6, [5])\nsince the quot schemes in question satisfies the local complete intersection property.\nRecall the definition of the standard Gromov invariants Ne (P (X1 , . . . , Xk ), g) for\nthe Grassmannian from [2] for a polynomial P (X1 , . . . , Xk ) of weighted degree e r +\nk(r \u2212 k)(g \u2212 1) with \u2212e large enough. This invariant in our notations is equal to\nN0,\u2212e (P (X1, . . . , Xk )) for the choices of e. It is also proved in Lemma 5.3, [4]\n(Also see [2], Remark before the Proposition 1.7) that the above invariant can be\nconsistantly defined for larger values of e by the following is defined for larger e\nby the recurssion N0,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xk )) = N0,e\u2212k (Xkr P (X1 , . . . , Xk )). This equality\nalso follows from Lemma 2.12.\nWe have the following explicit formula for the twisted Gromov invariants in terms\nof the standard Gromov invariants of the Grassmannian.\nTheorem 3.5 Let r and k be fixed. Let d = ar \u2212 b with 0 \u2264 b < r and e \u2264 emax (d).\nLet P (X1 , . . . , Xk ) be a polynomial of weighted degree d k\u2212r e+k(r\u2212k)(1\u2212g). Then\nall the twisted Gromov invariants are computable in terms of the actual Gromov\ninvariants of the Grassmannian by the following\nNd,e (P (X1 , . . . , Xk )) = N0,e\u2212ak (Xkb P (X1, . . . , Xk ))\n9\n\n\fProof This just follows from the Proposition 3.2 and Lemma 2.12.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.6 The above result shows that the twisted Gromov invariants are independent of the choice of the genus g curve C.\nNow we record here the formula of Vafa and Intriligator, proved by A. Bertram (see\n[2], [3]) and Siebert-Tian (see [18]) about explicit computation of Gromov invariants\nN0,e (P (X1, . . . , Xk )).\nLet P (X1 , . . . , Xk ) = \u03a0m\ni=1 Xa(i) be a polynomial with 0 < ai \u2264 k such that the\nP\nweighted degree of P is i (k \u2212 ai + 1) = \u2212er + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g). Then we have the\nfollowing.\nProposition 3.7 For the polynomial P = \u03a0m\ni=1 Xa(i) as above, the Gromov invariant\nN0,e (P (X1, . . . , Xk )) is given by the following.\n\u0001\nX\n\u03a0m\nr k(g\u22121) (\u22121)\u2212e(k\u22121)+(g\u22121)k(k\u22121)/2\nl=1 \u03c3k\u2212a(l)+1 (\u03c1)\nk!\n(\u03a0ri=1 \u03c1i \u03a0i6=j (\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j ))(g\u22121)\nr\n{(\u03c11 , ..., \u03c1k )|\u03c1i =1;\u03c1i 6=\u03c1j }\n\nwhere \u03c3j (\u03c1) is the j-th symmetric polynomial in \u03c1i 's.\nThe above proposition along with the Theorem 3.5 we can explicitly compute the\ntwisted Gromov invariants.\n\n4\n\nMaximal Subbundles\n\nIn this section we will relate the twisted Gromov invariants to the number of Maximal\nsubbundles of a generically stable bundles. We will assume that the genus of the\ncurve is atleast 2. Recall that for a generically stable bundle E of rank r and degree\nd we have smin,d = sk (E) = k(r\u2212k)(g\u22121)+\u01eb where \u01eb is a unique integer 0 \u2264 \u01eb \u2264 r\u22121\nsuch that smin,d = kd(mod r). Also recall the definition of emax,d from the previous\nsection.\nWe need the following proposition in the sequel.\nProposition 4.1 Let r, k, d and emax,d be as before. Then for a sufficiently general\nstable bundle E the quot scheme Quotk,emax,d (E) is a smooth scheme of dimension\nsmin,d + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g) consisting only of vector bundle quotients\nProof We have already seen that for generically stable bundle E every component\nof the quot scheme Quotk,emax (E) is of expected dimension. Now the result of Mukai\nand Sakai [13], as e = emax , ensures there is no boundary. Hence we have to only\nmax\n(E) = Quotk,emax (E)\nshow that that for a sufficiently general E the scheme Quotk,e\n0\nis smooth. This follows from Remark 5.4, of Holla [8] where this has been worked\nout for a principal G-bundle with G a connected reductive algebraic group.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fRemark 4.2 The above result follows from Lemma 2.1 of [12] for the case when\nsmin,d = k(r \u2212 k)(g \u2212 1). This is the only case when we will use the Proposition 4.1\nAlso the above result has been worked out in [15], Proposition 1.4 when k = 1.\nRemark 4.3 The Theorem 3.5 allows us to compute explicitly all the Chern numbers of the vector bundle F \u2217 (x), where F is the universal subbundle of pr\u22171 E on\nC \u00d7 Quotk,emax,d (E) interms of the Gromov invariants. From here one should be able\nto compute all the Chern numbers of the quot scheme itself. Since the Proposition\n4.1 ensures that these quot schemes are smooth projective schemes hence it would\nbe interesting to know what kind of objects these are. For the case k = 1 it is a conjecture of Oxbury (see [15], Conjecture 2.8) that these quot schemes are irreducible\nwhen they are of dimension greater than zero. We ask whether this conjecture is\ntrue for other k.\nNow we will handle the case when the choice of k, r and d are made such that k(r \u2212\nk)(g \u2212 1) = k d(mod r). In this case we can write down emax,d = dk + k(r \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 g).\nThis has the effect that for a bundle E which is generically stable in the sense\ndefined in Proposition 4.1, then the quot scheme Quotk,emax,d (E) is of dimension 0\nand smooth.\nHence we can count the number points in the quot scheme. We denote this number\nby m(r, d, k, g).\nWe have the following explicit formula for the number m(r, d, k, g).\nTheorem 4.4 Let d = ar \u2212 b with 0 \u2264 b < r. The number m(r, d, k, g) is calculated\nby the following formula.\nr k(g\u22121) (\u22121)(k\u22121)(bk\u2212(g\u22121)k\nk!\n\nX\n\n2 )/r\n\nb\u2212g+1\n(\u03a0m\nl=1 \u03c1l )\n\n(\u03c11 , ..., \u03c1k )|\u03c1ri =1;\u03c1i 6=\u03c1j\n\n(\u03a0i6=j (\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j ))(g\u22121)\n\n.\n\nProof This follows from the fact that the number m(r, d, k, g) we are interested\nin is exactly Nd,emax ,d (1) for our choice of vector bundle E in Proposition 4.1 as the\nexpected dimension of Quotk,emax (E) is 0. Now using the Theorem 3.5 we obtain\nm(r, d, k, g) = N0,emax \u2212ak (Xkb ). Now the Proposition 3.7 implies the theorem.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.5 m(r, d, 1, g) = r g\nThe above result recovers a part of the Theorem 3.1 of Oxbury [15].\nThe next case is when k = 2. We write d = ar \u2212 b and in this case the zero\ndimensionality of the quot scheme gives us the condition 2b \u2212 4(g \u2212 1) = 0(mod r).\nP\nNow using the fact that {\u03c1r =1,\u03c16=1} \u03c1i is equal to \u22121, if 0 < i < r and is equal to\nr \u2212 1 if i = 0, r, the Theorem 4.4 gives\nm(r, d, 2, g) =\n\nr 2(g\u22121)+1 (\u22121)g\u22121+(2b\u22124(g\u22121))/r\n2\n11\n\nX\n{z|z r =1,z6=1}\n\nz b\u2212g+1\n.\n(1 \u2212 z)2(g\u22121)\n\n\fThe last summation can be computed using some combinatorial identities which we\nP\nwill now briefly describe. We define B(k, m) = {z|z r =1,z6=0} z m (1 \u2212 z)\u2212k . Then we\ncan compute B(k, m) using the recursive relation B(k, m) = B(k, m \u2212 1) + B(k \u2212\nPr\u22121\n1, m \u2212 1) and the condition i=0\nB(k, i) = 0. These relations can easily be verified\nand one can hence obtain the following recursive formula for m > 0\nB(k, m) = B(k, 0) \u2212\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nB(k \u2212 1, i)\n\ni=0\n\nand B(k, 0) can be computed by the following formula.\nr\u22122\n\n1X\nB(k, 0) =\n(r \u2212 i \u2212 1)B(k \u2212 1, i)\nr i=0\nFor example using the above formulas we can calculate for 0 < m < r \u2212 1\nB(2, m) = \u2212(r 2 + r(6 \u2212 6m) + 6m2 \u2212 12m + 5)/12.\nLet r \u2265 3. If we assume that the genus of the curve is 2, then the condition for the\nquot scheme to be zero dimensional is 2b \u2212 4 = 0(mod r). Since 0 \u2264 b < r, hence\neither b = 2 or 2b \u2212 4 = r. Hence we have the following corollary\nCorollary 4.6 Let g = 2 and r \u2265 3. If b = 2 then we have m(r, d, 2, 2) = r 3 (r 2 \u2212\n1)/24 and if r = 2b \u2212 4 then we have m(r, d, 2, 2) = r 3 (r 2 + 2)/48.\nThe formula for r = 2b \u2212 4 was also obtained by Lange and Newstead (Theorem 4.1\n[12]).\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
