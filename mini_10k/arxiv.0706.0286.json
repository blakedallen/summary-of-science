Our readers might be wondering how and why an article\nwith such a strange title fits in a journal of popular culture. Actually, the common reaction when\npeople meet a theoretical physicist is to look at him like an alien, or an autistic psychopath unable to\nconduct a normal life enjoying more 'popular' subjects. Well, there are many reasons why\ntheoretical physics is not so popular even among people with a passion for culture. Everybody\nwould be puzzled when hearing the absurdities that we often profess about how Nature works!\nQuantum theory, specifically, affirms that our everyday experience of the \"macroscopic\" world\n(things that we see and touch) is useless to describe how the \"microscopic\" world (the minuscule\ncomponents of the same things that we see and touch) behaves. These tiny objects don't even know\nwhether they are particles (like billiard balls) or waves of energy (like sun rays), and not because we\nare unable to detect them with enough precision, but because there is an ultimate a priori limit to\nthe knowledge that can be gained. Thus, depending on how we look at them, they behave as\nparticles or as waves, answering randomly to our tests.\nNow go and tell everybody that the best minds of the last century discovered this (confirmed by\nover 70 years of experimental evidences): that the world is intrinsically random and it's impossible\nto have complete information of its components, and this implies that there are for example poor\nkittens which are at the same time dead and alive... I guess they will feel a bit depressed, and/or\nwill think that you are completely drunk!! Indeed, quantum theory might come handy! This\n\"uncertainty\" principle says that if you know perfectly where a particle is, you cannot know its\nspeed, and viceversa. So next time a policeman stops you saying you're running too fast with your\ncar, try to tell him (and let us know if it works) that according to a Mr Heisenberg, as you are in a\ngiven place there's no way to know which was your speed; and if he insists that he has recorded\nyour speed, you answer that you couldn't be in that given place at that moment, as you are\ndelocalized in the entire universe!!!\nNow, if a couple of brave readers arrived alive at this point, they must have at least a terrible\nheadache! Relax, you are in good company. Mr Einstein eventually refused quantum ideas because\n\"God \u2013 he said \u2013 does not play dice\". And Mr Feynman (and I'm mentioning all Nobel Prize\nwinners!) honestly said: \"Nobody understands quantum mechanics\". So, do I have any hope to\nmake quantum physics a popular piece of culture? I will now tell you something about the most\ncounterintuitive and radical feature of quantum mechanics.. yet I will try to make it as natural as the\nfeeling that everybody experiences from the moment of birth and before: love.\nEntanglement: passion at a distance.1 Mr Schr\u00f6dinger (another pioneer of quantum mechanics,\nand Nobel Prize winner: he promoted the cat example) coined the term \"entanglement\"\n(entrelazamiento) in 1935 to describe a peculiar connection between quantum systems:\n\"When two systems enter into temporary physical interaction due to known\nforces between them, and when after a time of mutual influence the systems\nseparate again, then they can no longer be described in the same way as before. I\nwould not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics,\nthe one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought. By the\ninteraction the two systems have become entangled.\"\nEntanglement thus manifests as a somehow puzzling correlation (Einstein blamed it as a \"spooky\naction at a distance\") between parties who once came into contact, and mantain their contact even\nmiles away. This has been experimentally demonstrated with individual atoms or light beams: but\nhow can it fit in our everyday experience of life? The closest feeling which comes into my mind is\n1\n\nThis expression was coined by R. D. Gill.\n\n\flove. Think of a mother and a child, or two lovers who shared an intense emotion, and are now\nliving at the opposite sides of the world. They feel each other, perceive the happiness or the sadness\nof the distant partner, and are influenced by this.\nSchr\u00f6dinger added:\n\"Another way of expressing the peculiar situation is: the best possible knowledge\nof a whole does not necessarily include the best possible knowledge of all its\nparts. The lack of knowledge is due to the interaction itself.\"\nIn our metaphor, nobody of the two lovers is\ncomplete on its own. Only when taken together,\nthey complement each other. They are nonseparable halves of the same entangled entity. No\nproper and complete understanding, on both\nphysical and psychological grounds, is available\nfor this phenomenon. But the language of art,\nprobably, can make it clearer: entanglement is\nadmirably depicted by Pamela Ott, who has almost\nzero knowledge of quantum mechanics (I asked\nher!) and paints \"from her subconscious\". The\nwaveness of the lines, the choice of complimentary\ncolors, the faded entwining of bodies and souls is\nwhat in my opinion most closely resembles a true\nimage of entanglement, and of loving passion.\nEntangled\nfamilies:\nmonogamy\nversus\npromiscuity. Now the subject becomes intriguing.\nWhat happens if there are three or more parties in\n\"Entanglement\" (58x71cm, acrylic)\nthis love game? Technically, we are addressing the\n\u00a9 Pamela Ott, 2002 <www.hottr6.com/ott>\ncomplex topic of \"multipartite entanglement\". In\nreproduced with permission\nthis context, there's a fundamental law:\nentanglement is monogamous! If our two lovers, traditionally called Alice and Bob, really love each\nother a lot \u2013 they are maximally entangled \u2013 there's no way for Alice to be even a little bit in love\nwith a Carlos (or the same for Bob and a Clara). This is maybe a bit controversial, as in our modern\nculture it's becoming more and more popular to violate monogamy in human relationships...but at\nleast let me say that entanglement, now that we look at it with the eyes of love, is not that bad beast\nthat people (even eminent ones) thought it to be. Are you starting to like it? Be advised though that\nif the love between Alice and Bob is not total, each of them can share some love with extra parties!!\nSo back home, be sure that your partner is maximally entangled to you, otherwise, suspicions are\nlegitimate!!\nAnother interesting aspect can arise in multi-party entangled relationships. The above picture (total\nentanglement excludes third parties) strictly applies to very simple, 'binary' objects (or persons),\nonly capable of answering either yes or no to any question without more structured argumentations\n(we call them \"qubits\"). But suppose now that Alice and Bob are more complex characters (we call\nthem \"continuous-variable systems\"), capable to answer questions providing a series of elaborate\nmotivations. Such kind of more reliable persons, may at some point think to enrich their family life\nwith a baby. Can they love their baby while being monogamous to each other? Yes, they can! In this\nscenario, the entanglement (love) between any two of them in their family can be arbitrarily strong,\nand this enhances the genuine entanglement (love) shared by the three of them (mom, dad, and the\nbaby). Isn't it a nice romantic picture? Actually, an alternative description could be in terms of a\ngroup of three or more people, which might also be all of the same sex! And this \"freedom\" that\narises if their personality is multifaceted and not binary, is a sort of promiscuity: the more any two\nof them are attracted by each other, the more they like to stay altogether acting in threesomes and\n\n\fmore intricate orgies! The quantum society, you see, is not that much different from ours after all:\nwe are made of quanta and immersed into them... who's influencing who?\nIs there a serious quantum impact on our society? These are just funny ways to try to relate the\nmicroscopic world (in which entanglement has probably nothing to do with love) to the world in\nwhich we are used to live. Everybody may imagine the situation which in his fantasy best applies to\nthis strange quantum realm. Already at the ages of Romans and Greeks, people invented figures\n(gods) associated to natural events, and pictured them as banqueting and being involved in love\naffairs. Entanglement is surely one of the mysterious 'gods' of the Book of Nature as we know it\ntoday, and \"when it comes to entanglement \u2013 according to V. Vedral \u2013 we've only just discovered\nthe tip of an iceberg\".\nI conclude by hinting at what entanglement can really do for us. Apart from its quite interesting\nsocial aspects at the microscopic level, the new technological quantum information revolution is\ntaking place, based on entanglement and its properties. In particular, Alice and Bob can send flirting\nemails to each other with the unconditional security that nobody can eavesdrop, as they encrypt\ntheir data via a secret key established from the intrinsic randomness of quantum particles, and\nprotected by the monogamy of entanglement. And this is reality: quantum cryptosystems are plugand-play devices which you can buy from MagiQ <www.magiqtech.com/> or IdQuantique\n<www.idquantique.com>, and install on your PC to definitely solve the problem of (quantum)\nhackers. Similarly, we are working to build quantum computers, which exploit quantum\nsuperpositions (wave and particle, dead and alive..) to do parallel calculations billions of times\nfaster than current supercomputers!!! And there is much, much more...\nI've enjoyed speaking about one particular aspect of science, which is entering into and gradually\naffecting popular culture. Like this, there are many others. Now, next time you meet a theoretical\nphysicist, please don't look at him in that strange way :) and remember ... we are all entangled!\n\nGerardo Adesso\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno (Italy)\n& Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (Spain)\ngerardo.adesso@gmail.com\n\n\f"}
