It is shown that the recent HERMES data on the transverse \u039b0 polarization in the inclusive\nquasi-real photoproduction at xF > 0 can be accommodated by the strange quark scattering model.\nRelations with the quark recombination approach are discussed.\nPACS. 13.60.-r \u2013 13.88.+e\n\n1 Introduction\nPolarization of \u039b0 hyperons has been under scrutiny almost since the very moment of its discovery. Investigations\nof the phenomenon received especially great impetus in\n1976 due to the striking experimental results obtained at\nFERMILAB, where the hyperons produced in pN collisions at 300 GeV proton beam energy were highly polarized [1]. The polarization was transverse and negative, directed opposite to the unit vector n \u221d [pb \u00d7 p\u039b ], where pb\nand p\u039b are the beam and hyperon momenta, respectively.\nOnly this direction is allowed by the parity conservation in strong interactions provided the incident particles\nare unpolarized (henceforth, under polarization we imply\njust transverse one unless otherwise stated). The results\nturned out to be in disagreement with predictions of perturbative QCD, no polarization had been expected to play\nany significant role in high energy processes as the helicity\nis conserved in the limit of massless quarks.\nThe polarization has been also observed in other hadronhadron reactions at different kinematic regimes [2]. Its\nfeatures qualitatively coincide in almost all the reactions,\nfor instance, being insensitive to the incident particle energy, exhibiting roughly linear growth by magnitude with\nthe hyperon transverse momentum pT and being negative.\nThe only known exception is the K \u2212 p process, where the\npolarization sign has been found to be positive [3].\nCertainly, there have been proposed many models attempting to account for the results, e.g. [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,\n11,12,13,14,15,16], however neither of them is able to describe the complete set of the available measurements.\nThe \u039b0 wave function facilitates theoretical studies allowing to describe the phenomenon in a reasonable way.\nThe exact SU(6) symmetry, requires the spin-flavor part\nof the wave function to be combined of the ud diquark\na\n\ne-mail: ialspbu@mail.ru\n\nin a singlet spin state and the strange quark of spin 1/2,\nor formally |\u039bi1/2 = |udi0 |si1/2 , where the subscriptions\ndenote the spin states. Therefore, the total spin of \u039b0 is\nentirely given by the spin of its valence s quark. There is\nalso an alternative look at the spin transfer in fragmentation appeared after publication of the polarized deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (DIS) data of the EMC\nCollaboration [17]. It suggests that the spin carried by the\nvalence quarks is only a part of the total nucleon spin, the\nrest one being attributed, for example, to the orbital angular momenta of the valence quarks and to the nucleon\nsea (sea quarks, antiquarks and gluons). Which picture,\nSU(6) or DIS, is suitable for the description of the process\nremains still an important issue [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The\n\u039b0 hyperon can provide here a useful instrument for the\nstudy of the spin effects in strong interactions.\nWe used the SU(6) approach throughout this paper.\nThe choice was dictated by a wish to keep the quark scattering model as it is, encouraged by the SU(6) based calculations of the longitudinal \u039b0 polarization in e+ e\u2212 annihilation at the Z 0 pole [24] and their successful experimental\nverification [25,26].\nAccording to the empirical rules proposed by DeGrand\nand Miettinen, the polarization sign depends on whether\nthe s quark is accelerated (increases its energy) or decelerated (decreases its energy) in the \u039b0 formation process\n[5]. To illustrate, there are no valence s quarks in the initial state of the pp reaction so that they come from the\nquark sea to form the final \u039b0 . But the sea quarks predominantly populate small x-states (x is Bjorken variable) and\nconsequently increase their average energy coming in the\nvalence content of \u039b0 . Here the polarization is negative.\nContrary, incident pseudoscalar kaons of the K \u2212 p reaction already contain valence strange quarks mostly decelerated in the hadronization because the average energy of\nthe created \u039b0 -s is less than that of the K \u2212 beam. In this\n\n\fI. Alikhanov, O. Grebenyuk: Transverse \u039b0 polarization in quasi-real photoproduction\n\n2\n\ncase the sign is positive. Similar ideas were implemented\nin flux-tube models with orbital angular momentum [4].\nIt was natural to wonder whether the polarization took\nplace in \u039b0 electro and/or photoproduction. Would one\nobserve here the same features with hadron-hadron reactions? These questions have been investigated, for example, in experiments on high energy \u03b3N scattering performed at CERN [27] and SLAC [28] in the beginning of\nthe eighties. However, their statistical accuracy is indecisive and would hardly enable one to conclude on the\nmagnitude or on the sign of the polarization.\nThe transverse \u039b0 polarization has been also measured in unpolarized e+ e\u2212 annihilations, for example, by\nTASSO Collaboration at 14, 22 and 34 GeV center-ofmass (cms) energies [29] and near the Z 0 pole by OPAL\n[26]. The polarization observed in both experiments is\nconsistent with zero. Practically, this process can be a\ngood place for deriving some important information on\nthe hadronization phase. In particular, it can assist understanding in which extent final state interactions contribute\nto the transverse polarization [30].\nIn light of the scarce statistics for the \u039b0 photoproduction process, the HERMES experiments on the 27.6 GeV\npositron beam scattering off the nucleon target acquires a\nparticular status providing a good opportunity for observation of the polarization in electroproduction. The collaboration has measured nonzero positive transverse polarization, when most of the intermediate photons are quite\nclose to the mass shell, i.e. Q2 = \u2212(pei \u2212 pef )2 \u2248 0 GeV2\n[31], where pei and pef are the 4-momenta of the initial\nand scattered electrons, respectively (quasi-real photoproduction).\nExperimental properties of the polarization at HERMES turned out to be very reminiscent of those in the\nK \u2212 p reaction [3], which has been successfully described\nby a model assuming the polarization to appear mostly\nvia strange quark scattering in a color field [6,7].\nThus, there are indications that mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon in the K \u2212 p and ep may be similar,\nat least, within the covered kinematic region. These arguments inspired us to apply the model to the \u039b0 quasi-real\nphotoproduction data obtained by HERMES.\nAnother goal of this paper is qualitatively to discuss\nsome relations between the calculations presented herein\nand the quark recombination model (QRM) [14].\n\nElectrons, when scattering off nuclei, have been known\nto be able to acquire polarization. Analytically, it can\nbe found within QED by considering a process of Dirac\npointlike particle scattering off static Coulomb potential\nprovided next-to-leading order amplitudes are taken into\naccount [32,33] (see also Ref. [34]). The corresponding formula reads\nsin3 \u03b8/2 ln(sin \u03b8/2)\n2\u03b1em mp\nn,\nE 2 [1 \u2212 p2 /E 2 sin2 \u03b8/2] cos \u03b8/2\n\n\u03b6i(f ) =\n\nEi(f ) + pzi(f )\n,\nEb + pzb\n\n(2)\n\nhere the subscription b denotes the beam. We note that \u03b6\nis invariant under Lorentz boosts being useful in its application.\nAccording to recipes given in Ref. [7], one should move\nto a frame, where the magnitudes of the initial and final s\nquark momenta are the same (originally called S-frame).\nIt is reached by performing a Lorentz transformation along\nthe proton momentum. For this purpose, one can write\n(pi * pf ) = p2 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) + m2s ,\n\n(3)\n\npT f = pT = p sin \u03b8,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere pi(f ) are the 4-momenta of the scattering quark,\npT f is the transverse momentum of the scattered quark\n\u2212\nin the\np center-of-mass frame of the K p reaction, while\n2\n2\np = E \u2212 ms , pT and \u03b8 refer to the S-frame.\nOn the other hand, using Eq. (2) leads to\nm2s (\u03b6i \u2212 \u03b6f )2\n2\n\u03b6i \u03b6f\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 2 \u03b6f\n2 \u03b6i\np\n+ (pT i * pT f ),\n+ pT f\n+\n2 T i \u03b6i\n\u03b6f\n\n(pi * pf ) \u2212 m2s =\n\n2 Quark scattering model for \u039b0\n\nP =\n\nwhere E, p, m and \u03b8 are the energy, momentum by magnitude, mass and scattering angle of the electron, respectively, \u03b1em is the fine structure constant, n \u221d [pi \u00d7 pf ],\npi and pf are the vectors of the electron momenta in the\ninitial (i) and final (f ) states.\nIn Ref. [6], Szwed proposed to explain the \u039b0 polarization as polarization of its valence strange quark in scattering using Eq. (1), the \u039b0 wave function favors such a\nconsideration quite well. The idea is to perform the following interchanges in Eq. (1): electron \u2194 quark, \u03b1em \u2194\nC\u03b1s (Coulomb potential \u2194 color field), where \u03b1s is the\nstrong coupling and C is the color factor.\nThis approach has been applied to describe the polarization in the K \u2212 p reaction and successfully reproduced\nits main features at 2C\u03b1s = 5.0 and the s quark mass\nms = 0.5 GeV [7].\nDue to some peculiarities of the HERMES experiment,\nthe polarization was not measured\u221ain the traditional form\nof the dependence on xF = 2pz / s (pz is the longitude\n\u221a\ncomponent of the detected particle momentum, s is the\ntotal cms energy). Therefore, we have expressed the model\nin terms of the light cone variable \u03b6 the available data\ndepend on [31]. It is defined as\n\n(1)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere (pT i * pT f ) is the ordinary scalar product of the\ntransverse momentum vectors.\nNeglecting, as a first approximation, the incident quark\ntransverse momentum (pT i =0), after some algebra, one\ncan obtain from Eqs.

[31], corresponds to the events of xF > 0 in the cms frame of\nthe \u03b3 \u2217 p reaction (current fragmentation). The procedure\nis now straightforward. In the model discussed above, one\nsubstitutes the K \u2212 meson by the intermediate quasi-real\nphoton \u03b3 \u2217 . Since the considered hyperons are produced in\nthe photon fragmentation region, we assumed that the \u039b0\nkinematic is determined here in the main by the quarks\noriginated from the photon. The (ud)0 diquarks are supposed to come mostly from the proton target. The polarization process is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Note that\na similar diagram, corresponding to the s quark scattering\noff the scalar diquark (ud)0 , appears also in the QRM [14]\nwhen one calculates the polarization in the K \u2212 p reaction,\nhowever the interaction is chosen to be scalar.\n\nFig. 1. A schematic diagram of the \u039b0 polarization process in\nquasi-real photoproduction. The s quarks originated from the\nphoton scatters off the target color field, getting thus polarized,\nand form the final hyperon recombining with a (ud)0 diquarks\nfrom the proton target. An arrow over a letter indicates the\npolarization.\n\nWithin the present approach, one needs to know the\n\u03b6i distribution of the incident s quarks originated from\nthe quasi-real photons emitted by the positron beam. To\nfind it, we used the PYTHIA 6.2 program [35], adopting\nthus the positron-to-quark transition mechanisms implemented therein. The obtained distribution is shown in Fig.\n2 (scattered plot) together with its fit (solid line).\n\nFig. 2. The \u03b6i distribution of the quarks originated from the\npositron beam according to the PYTHIA program (scattered\nplot). The corresponding fit is presented by the solid line.\nEvents assumed to contribute to the region of \u03b6 > 0.25 are\nhatched.\n\nThe final s quark kinematic was determined according\nto the following\n\u03b6f =\n\nms\n\u03b6\u039b ,\nm\u039b\n\nVT =\n\npT \u039b\n,\nm\u039b\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b6\u039b and pT \u039b refer to the detected \u039b0 hyperons. Let\nus omit in the sequel the index \u039b. The relations in Eq.\n(10) define the quark momenta as fixed fractions of the\ncorresponding final hyperon momenta. In particular, the\ndirection of the s quark transverse momentum is assumed\nto point in most cases in the direction of pT \u039b [6]. It is,\nof course, only an approximate picture. One should take\ninto account that the quarks are just constituents of the\nhyperon but not free. In fact, a momentum component of\na quark inside a hadron is not fixed but has an intrinsic\ndistribution.\nNote that there should be a threshold for the \u039b0 production in the region of \u03b6 > 0.25 initiated by the incoming\nquarks due to the undetected hadron system always exists and carries also away some part of the energy. In other\nwords, not all the \u03b6i events will contribute to the \u03b6 > 0.25\nregion. Thus, in the calculations, we took into account\nonly those quarks with 0.5 \u2264 \u03b6i \u2264 1 (hatched area in Fig.\n2).\nAs the experimental \u03b6 dependence of the polarization\nis available integrally over pT , we additionally introduced\naveraging over the transverse momentum of the detected\n\u039b0 -s. In this case, the polarization was determined as\nP\u03b6 =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b6i dpT h(pT )P\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u03b6\n, pT f (\u03b6i ).\n\u03b6i\n\n(11)\n\nHere, h(pT ) and f (\u03b6i ) are the pT and \u03b6i distribution\nfunctions of the detected \u039b0 -s and the incident quarks\n\n\fI.

Grebenyuk: Transverse \u039b0 polarization in quasi-real photoproduction\n\n4\n\nrespectively, P (\u03b6/\u03b6i , pT ) is the polarization defined by Eq.\n(9).\nFor similar reasons, we determined the pT dependence\nof the polarization as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u03b6\n(12)\n, pT f (\u03b6i ),\nPpT = d\u03b6i d\u03b6 g(\u03b6)P\n\u03b6i\n\nP\u03b6 (%)\n\nwhere g(\u03b6) is the \u03b6 distribution function of the detected\nhyperons.\nUsing Eqs. (11) and (12), we carried out the calculations. We used a typical \u03b6 distribution of the detected \u039b0 -s\n(0.25 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 0.5). For h(pT ), we adopted that obtained by\nHERMES (0.2 GeV \u2264 pT \u2264 1.2 GeV) [36]. Note that all\nthe distributions were prenormalized to unity. As the free\nparameter values, we have taken 2C\u03b1s = 5.0 and ms = 0.5\nGeV.\nThe numerical results in comparison with the HERMES data are shown in Fig. 3. One can see that the experiment is reasonably reproduced.\n\n12\nHERMES\nnumeric.\n\n10\n8\n\nthe contributions from the heavier resonances, such as \u03a3 0 ,\n\u039e and \u03a3 \u2217 , into account, their values are presumably considerable in \u039b0 polarization [24,37,38]. A difficulty is also\ncaused by the impossibility to derive the running coupling\nconstant \u03b1s from the HERMES data.\nIn fact, the calculations by Eqs. (11) and (12) have\nbeen carried out similarly with the quark recombination\nmodel [14], the latter describes the polarization in more\nquantitative manner. In the QRM, the central point is the\nsquared subprocess amplitude averaged over the Bjorken\nvariables in the initial and final states, their role, in our\ncase, were played by \u03b6i and \u03b6. A substantial distinction\nbetween the QRM and the present quark scattering approach (QSM) is the interaction. For the QRM, it has\nbeen assumed to be a scalar force, while the QSM calculations are based on QCD. Thus it seems to be attractive\nalternatively to specify the QRM interaction by the color\none. Doing it could be regarded as a further development\nof the present approach. It will include, in particular, the\ntransverse momentum of the incident quarks, the structure functions of the projectile as well as the outgoing\nhyperon instead of the approximations of Eq. (10), it will\nalso more explicate the underlying subprocesses. An estimation of the contributions of the heavier resonances is in\nprogress now.\n\n6\n4\n\nReferences\n\n2\n0\n\nPpT (%)\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b6\n\n16\n14\n\nHERMES (\u03b6 > 0.25)\n\n12\n\nnumeric.\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\npT (GeV)\n\nFig. 3.

We neglected the transverse momentum of the\nincident quarks (pT i ), while, certainly, a strict consideration would require taking it into account. However, for the\ngoal, the present work aimed at, such an approximation\nreflects the general tendencies. It would be fair to expect a\nrelatively narrow pT i distribution for the events contributing to the region of \u03b6 > 0.25. To find the \u03b6i distribution, we\nused the PYTHIA program, which gives, in turn, rather\nqualitative than quantitative predictions. We did not take\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nG. Bunce et al., Phys.
