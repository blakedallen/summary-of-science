One of the ingredients in BCS theory is pairing between\nelectrons with opposite momenta and spins, i.e., matching between the Fermi energies of\nspin-up and spin-down electrons. In the phase where the system is partially polarized, Fermi\nenergies of spin-up and spin-down electrons become unequal. This leads to a non-standard\nform of pairing which was predicted independently by Fulde and Ferrell [1], and Larkin and\nOvchinnikov [2]. Fulde and Ferrell discovered that under a strong external field, superconducting electron pairs have nonzero pairing momentum and spin polarization. At about the\nsame time, Larkin and Ovchinnikov suggested that the formation of pairs of electrons with\ndifferent momenta, i.e., ~k and \u2212~k + ~q where ~q 6= 0, is energetically favored over pairs of\nelectrons with opposite momenta, i.e., ~k and \u2212~k, when the separation between Fermi surfaces is sufficiently large. Consequently, the density of spins and the superconducting order\nparameter become periodic functions of the spatial coordinates. This non-conventional superconducting state is known in literature as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)\nstate.\nMore recently, theoretical predictions of the existence of an FFLO state in one-dimensional\n(1D) interacting fermions [3, 4] have emerged by employment of various methods, such as\nBethe ansatz (BA) [5, 6], density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [7\u201311], quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) [12], mean field theory [13\u201316] and bosonization [17]. At finite magnetization, it was found by Feiguin and Heidrich-Meisner [7] that pair correlations for the\nattractive Hubbard model in a parabolic trapping potential has a power-law decay of the\nform npair \u221d cos(kFFLO |x|)/|x|\u03b1 and the momentum pair distribution has peaks at the mismatch of the Fermi surfaces kFFLO = \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ). Wave numbers for the oscillations were\nnumerically found as \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ) for the pair correlation function and as 2\u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ) for\nthe density difference hn\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 i [8]. The FFLO pairing wave number was also confirmed by\nthe occurrence of a peak in the pair momentum distribution corresponding to the difference\nbetween the Fermi momenta of individual species [9, 12]. From mean field theory, it was\ndemonstrated that the FFLO phase exists in the large-scale response of the Fermi gas [15]\nand even for temperatures up to 0.1TF [14].\nOn the other hand, critical behavior of 1D many-body systems with linear dispersion in\n2\n\n\fthe vicinities of their Fermi points can be described by conformal field theory. Some time\nago, the critical behavior of the Hubbard model with attractive interaction was investigated\nby Bogoliubov and Korepin [18\u201321]. They showed that 1D superconductivity occurs when\nthe average distance between electron pairs is larger than the average distance between\nindividual electrons of these pairs. This means that the correlation function for the single\n\u2020\nparticle Green's function decays exponentially, i.e., h\u03c8n,s\n\u03c81,s i \u2192 e\u2212n/\u03be with \u03be = vF /\u2206 and\n\ns =\u2191, \u2193, whereas the singlet pair correlation function decays as a power of distance, i.e.,\n\u2020\n\u2020\nh\u03c8n,\u2191\n\u03c8n,\u2193\n\u03c81,\u2191 \u03c81,\u2193 i \u2192 n\u2212\u03b8 . Here \u2206 is the energy gap, and the critical exponents \u03be and \u03b8 are\n\nboth greater than zero. This criterion is met when the external magnetic field is small, i.e.,\nH < Hc . Once the external field exceeds the critical value, i.e., H > Hc , Cooper pairs are\ndestroyed. Thus both of these correlation functions decay as a power of distance and the\npairs lose their dominance, i.e., electrons become more or less independent of each other.\nSo far, theoretical confirmation of the FFLO state in 1D still relies on numerical evidence\nof spatial oscillations in the pair correlations. Despite key features of the T = 0 phase\ndiagram [5, 6, 22\u201325] for the attractive Fermi gas were experimentally confirmed using finite\ntemperature density profiles of trapped fermionic 6 Li atoms [28], the unambiguous theoretical\nconfirmation and experimental observation of FFLO pairing is still an open problem. As\nremarked in Ref. [9] that the 1D FFLO scenario proposed in Ref. [17] does not apply to\n1D attractive fermions where quantum phase transition from the fully-paired phase into\nthe spin polarized phase does not belong to commensurate-incommensurate university class,\nalso see Refs. [22, 26]. For 1D attractive spin-1/2 fermions with polarization [3, 4], the\nlow-energy physics of the homogeneous system is described by a two-component TomonagaLuttinger liquid (TLL) of bound pairs and excess unpaired fermions in the charge sector\nand ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions in the spin sector [27]. In this paper, we determine\nthe critical behavior of the single particle Green's function, pair correlation function and\nspin correlation function within the context of a TLL. We show that the long distance\nasymptotics of various correlation functions provide a microscopic origin of FFLO pairing\nfor 1D attractive fermions.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We derive finite-size corrections for the ground state\nenergy of the system in Section II. In Section III, we derive finite-size corrections for lowlying excitations and introduce the dressed charge formalism. Integral equations for each\ncomponent of the dressed charge matrix is solved analytically in the strong coupling limit\n3\n\n\f|c| \u226b 1. In Section IV, we derive correlation functions for different operators and discuss\nthe signature of FFLO pairing. Finally, conclusions and remarks are made in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nGROUND STATE AND FINITE-SIZE CORRECTIONS\n\nWe consider Nf fermions with SU(2) spin symmetry in a 1D system of length L with\nperiodic boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian for the spin-1/2 Fermi gas [3, 4] is given by\nNf\nX\nX\n\u22022\nH =\u2212\n\u03b4(xj \u2212 xk ),\n+\n2c\n2\n\u2202x\nj\nj=1\n1\u2264j<k\u2264N\n\n(1)\n\nf\n\nwhere c < 0 is the attractive interaction strength. This model is one of the most important\nexactly solvable quantum many-body systems. In recent years, it has attracted considerable\nattention from theory [5, 6, 22\u201325] and experiment [28] due to evidence of the FFLO state.\nSystems exhibiting novel phase transitions at T = 0 are particularly useful in studying TLL\nphysics [27] and the nature of the FFLO state.\nThe quasimomenta for unpaired fermions and bound pairs are given by kj and \u039b\u03b1 \u00b1 ic\u2032\nwhich satisfy the BA equations\n\u0013\nkj \u2212 \u039b\u03b1\n,\nkj L = 2\u03c0Ij +\n2 tan\n\u2032|\n|c\n\u03b1=1\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\n\u0013\nNb\nNu\nX\n\u039b\u03b1 \u2212 kj\n\u039b\u03b1 \u2212 \u039b\u03b2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2 tan\n2\u039b\u03b1 L = 2\u03c0J\u03b1 +\n2 tan\n+\n,\n\u2032|\n\u2032|\n|c\n2|c\nj=1\n\u03b2=1\nNb\nX\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere quantum numbers Ij and J\u03b1 are given by\nIj \u2261\n\nNb\n2\n\n(mod 1),\n\nJ\u03b1 \u2261\n\nNu \u2212 Nb + 1\n2\n\n(mod 1).\n\n(4)\n\nHere c\u2032 = c/2, and Nu and Nb denote the number of unpaired fermions and bound pairs,\nrespectively.

It becomes convenient to\nanalyze phase transitions and low-lying excitations in the presence of external fields at zero\ntemperature. In the thermodynamic limit, the grand partition function is Z = tr(e\u2212H/T ) =\ne\u2212G/T , where the Gibbs free energy is given by G = E \u2212 HM z \u2212 \u03bcn \u2212 T S, and is written in\nterms of the magnetization H, the chemical potential \u03bc and the entropy S [30]. Equilibrium\nstates satisfy the condition of minimizing the Gibbs free energy with respect to particle\nand hole densities for the charge and spin degrees of freedom (more details are given in\nRefs. [22, 30\u201333]). At zero temperature, the ground state properties are determined by the\n5\n\n\fdressed energy equations\n\u03b5\u03b1 (k\u03b1 ) =\n\n\u03b5(0)\n\u03b1 (k\u03b1 )\n\n+\n\nXZ\n\n\u03b2=u,b\n\nQ\u03b2\n\nK\u03b1\u03b2 (k\u03b1 \u2212 k\u03b2 )\u03b5\u03b2 (k\u03b2 )dk\u03b2 ,\n\n(\u03b1 = u, b),\n\n(11)\n\n\u2212Q\u03b2\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u03b1 (k\u03b1 ) are given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n(0)\n\u03b5u (ku )\n(0)\n\n\u03b5b (kb )\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f8=\uf8ed\n\nku2\n2kb2 \u2212 |c|2/2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(12)\n\n1D many-body systems are critical at T = 0 and exhibit not only global scale invariance\nbut local scale invariance too, i.e., conformal invariance. The conformal group is infinite\ndimensional and completely determines the conformal dimensions and correlation functions\nwhen the excitations are gapless [34]. Conformal invariance predicts that the energy per\nunit length has a universal finite-size scaling form that is characterized by the dimensionless\nnumber C, which is the central charge of the underlying Virasoro algebra [35, 36]. From the\ndensity distributions (9) and dressed energy equations (11), the finite-size corrections to the\nground state energy is given by\n\u03b50 = \u03b5\u221e\n0 \u2212\n\nC\u03c0 X\nv\u03b1 ,\n6L2 \u03b1=u,b\n\n(13)\n\nwhere C = 1, and vu and vb are the velocities of unpaired fermions and bound pairs,\nrespectively.

The\nterm \u03b5\u221e\n0 represents the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., N, L \u2192 \u221e. In\nthe strong coupling limit, exact expressions for the velocities can be found in Refs. [22, 37].\n\nIII.\n\nLOW-LYING EXCITATIONS AND DRESSED CHARGE EQUATIONS\n\nCritical phenomena of critical systems are described by finite-size corrections for their\nlow-lying excitations. The method we use to study correlation functions of the spin-1/2\nFermi gas with attractive interaction follows closely the method set out in Refs. [40\u201343].\nThe conformal dimensions of two-point correlation functions can be calculated from the\n6\n\n\felements of the dressed charge matrix Z. Long distance asymptotics of various correlation\nfunctions are then examined through the dressed charge formalism at the T = 0. Three\ntypes of low-lying excitations are considered in the calculations of finite-size corrections.\nType 1 excitation is characterized by moving a particle close to the right or left Fermi\npoints outside the Fermi sea. It is equivalent to changing the quantum numbers I\u03b1,j close\nto I\u03b1\u00b1 for unpaired fermions (\u03b1 = u) and bound pairs (\u03b1 = b). I\u03b1\u00b1 characterize the Fermi\npoints of each Fermi sea and are given by I\u03b1+ = I\u03b1max + 1/2 and I\u03b1\u2212 = I\u03b1min \u2212 1/2. The change\nin total momentum from Type 1 excitations is\n\u2206P =\n\n2\u03c0 X\n(N\u03b1+ \u2212 N\u03b1\u2212 ),\nL\n\n(15)\n\n\u03b1=u,b\n\nand the change in energy is\n2\u03c0 X \u03b5\u2032\u03b1 (Q\u03b1 |Q\u00b1 ) +\n(N + N\u03b1\u2212 )\nL\np\u2032\u03b1 (Q\u03b1 |Q\u00b1 ) \u03b1\n\u03b1=u,b\n2\u03c0 X\nv\u03b1 (N\u03b1+ + N\u03b1\u2212 ).\n=\nL \u03b1=u,b\n\n\u2206E =\n\n(16)\n\nHere N\u03b1+ \u2265 0 (N\u03b1\u2212 \u2265 0) stems from the change in distribution of quantum numbers close\nto the right (left) Fermi points. This type of excitation is commonly known as particle-hole\nexcitation.\nType 2 excitation arises from the change in total number of unpaired fermions or bound\npairs. It is characterized by the change in quantum numbers\nN\u03b1 = I\u03b1+ \u2212 I\u03b1\u2212 ,\n\n(\u03b1 = u, b),\n\n(17)\n\ni.e., \u2206N\u03b1 = N\u03b1excited \u2212 N\u03b1ground .\nOn the other hand, Type 3 excitation is caused by moving a particle from the left Fermi\npoint to the right Fermi point and vice versa. This type of excitation is also known as\nbackscattering. It is characterized by the quantum numbers\n\u2206D\u03b1 =\n\nI\u03b1+ + I\u03b1\u2212\n,\n2\n\n(\u03b1 = u, b),\n\n(18)\n\nwhile leaving \u2206N\u03b1 unchanged.\nAll three types of excitations can be unified in the following form of the finite-size cor7\n\n\frections for the energy and total momentum of the system\n2\u03c0\n\u2206E =\nL\n\u2206P =\n\n2\u03c0\nL\n\n!\nX\n1t\n(\u2206N)t (Z\u22121 )VZ\u22121 \u2206N + t (\u2206D)ZVt Z\u2206D +\nv\u03b1 (N\u03b1+ + N\u03b1\u2212 ) , (19)\n4\n\u03b1=u,b\n!\nX\nt\n\u2206N\u2206D + Nu \u2206Du + Nb \u2206Db +\nv\u03b1 (N\u03b1+ \u2212 N\u03b1\u2212 ) .\n(20)\n\u03b1=u,b\n\nHere we use the notations\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2206N = \uf8ed\n\n\u2206Nu\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n\u2206Nb\n\uf8f6\nvu 0\n\uf8f8,\nV=\uf8ed\n0 vb\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2206D = \uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\nZ=\uf8ed\n\n\u2206Du\n\u2206Db\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nZuu (Qu ) Zub(Qb )\nZbu (Qu ) Zbb (Qb )\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nThe dressed charge equations are a set of four coupled integral equations that read\nZ Qb\nZuu (k) = 1 \u2212\na1 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zub (\u03bb)d\u03bb,\nZub (k) = \u2212\nZbu (k) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2212Qb\nQu\n\na1 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zuu (\u03bb)d\u03bb \u2212\n\n\u2212Qu\nZ Qb\n\nZbb (k) = 1 \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nQb\n\na2 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zub (\u03bb)d\u03bb,\n\n(23)\n\n\u2212Qb\n\na1 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zbb (\u03bb)d\u03bb,\n\n\u2212Qb\nZ Qu\n\n(24)\n\na1 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zbu (\u03bb)d\u03bb \u2212\n\n\u2212Qu\n\nZ\n\nQb\n\na2 (k \u2212 \u03bb)Zbb (\u03bb)d\u03bb.\n\n(25)\n\n\u2212Qb\n\nQuantum numbers \u2206Du and \u2206Db (18) are chosen based on the conditions given in Eq. (4)\nand also on the conditions that \u2206Du \u2261 \u2206Nu /2 (mod 1) and \u2206Db \u2261 \u2206Nb /2 (mod 1).\nCombining both conditions together with the definition given in Eq. (18) yields\n\u2206Du \u2261\n\n\u2206Nu + \u2206Nb\n2\n\n(mod 1),\n\n\u2206Db \u2261\n\n\u2206Nu\n2\n\n(mod 1).\n\n(26)\n\nWhen the external magnetic field H is smaller than the critical field, spin excitations for\nthis model are gapped. Once H exceeds this critical field, spin excitations become gapless\nand the system becomes conformally invariant. In this spin polarized phase, spin degrees of\nfreedom are suppressed due to the ferromagnetic nature of excess unpaired fermions under\na magnetic field. Therefore, bound pairs and excess unpaired fermions form two Fermi seas\nwhich can be described by a two-component TLL at low temperatures. Hence conformal\ninvariance results in a universal finite-size scaling form of the energy shown in Eqs. (13)\nand (19), and a universal form of the critical exponents of two-point correlation functions\n8\n\n\fbetween primary fields hO \u2020(x, t)O(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )i which are determined by the finite-size corrections\nof the model. Multi-point correlation functions can be derived by taking the product of\ntwo-point correlation functions.\nWhen T = 0, the correlation functions of 1D systems decay as the power of distance, but\nwhen T > 0 they decay exponentially. Following the standard calculations in Ref. [43], the\nconformal dimensions are given by\n\u0012\n\u00132\nZbb \u2206Nu \u2212 Zub \u2206Nb\n\u00b1\n2\u2206u = Zuu \u2206Du + Zbu \u2206Db \u00b1\n+ 2Nu\u00b1 ,\n(27)\n2 det Z\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZuu \u2206Nb \u2212 Zbu \u2206Nu\n\u00b1\n+ 2Nb\u00b1 ,\n(28)\n2\u2206b = Zub \u2206Du + Zbb \u2206Db \u00b1\n2 det Z\nwhere N\u03b1\u00b1 (\u03b1 = u, b) characterize the descendent fields from the primary fields. General\ntwo-point correlation functions at T = 0 take the form\nhO(x, t)O(0, 0)i =\n\nexp(\u22122i(Nu \u2206Du + Nb \u2206Db )x)\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n(x \u2212 ivu t)2\u2206u (x + ivu t)2\u2206u (x \u2212 ivb t)2\u2206b (x + ivb t)2\u2206b\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nThe exponential oscillating term in the asymptotic behavior comes from Type 3 excitations,\ni.e., backscattering. Quantum numbers for the low-lying excitations completely determine\nthe nature of the asymptotic behavior of these correlations. Here we are only concerned\nwith the T = 0 case.\nThe four dressed charge equations can be broken up into sets of two pairs. Eqs. (22) and\n(23) constitute one pair, whilst Eqs. (24) and (25) make up the other. Since we are interested\nin the strong coupling limit |c| \u226b 1, both sets of equations can be solved iteratively up to\naccuracy 1/|c|.

[22], every correlation function at zero temperature decays spatially\nas some form of power law [34\u201336, 38, 39]. G\u2191 (x, t) is characterized by (\u2206Nu , \u2206Nb ) = (1, 0)\nwhich in turn allows quantum numbers \u2206Du \u2208 Z + 1/2 and \u2206Db \u2208 Z + 1/2.

The constants A\u2191,1 and A\u2191,2 cannot be derived from\nthe finite-size corrections for low-lying excitations. Here we only aim to evaluate the long\ndistance asymptotics of these correlation functions. Instead of using Nu and Nb in the\noscillation term, we choose to use n\u2191 = N\u2191 /L and n\u2193 = N\u2193 /L to elucidate the imbalance in\nthe densities of spin-up and spin-down fermions. Both sets of variables are related by the\nrelations Nu = N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 and Ns = N\u2193 .\nNext we consider the charge density correlation function Gnn (x, t) together with the spin\ncorrelation function Gz (x, t). Both of these correlation functions are characterized by the\nset of quantum numbers (\u2206Nu , \u2206Nb ) = (0, 0) which allows quantum numbers \u2206Du \u2208 Z and\n12\n\n\f\u2206Db \u2208 Z.

The second, third and fourth terms arise from the choices (1, 0), (0, 1)\nand (\u22121, 1), respectively.\nFinally we consider the pair correlation function Gp (x, t). This correlation function is\ncharacterized by the set of quantum numbers (\u2206Nu , \u2206Nb ) = (0, 1) which allows quantum\nnumbers \u2206Du \u2208 Z + 1/2 and \u2206Db \u2208 Z. The leading terms are\nGp (x, t) = h\u03c8\u2191\u2020 (x, t)\u03c8\u2193\u2020 (x, t)\u03c8\u2191 (0, 0)\u03c8\u2193 (0, 0)i\nAp,1 cos (\u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 )x) Ap,2 cos (\u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 3n\u2193 )x)\n\u2248\n+\n,\n|x + ivu t|\u03b81 |x + ivb t|\u03b82\n|x + ivu t|\u03b83 |x + ivb t|\u03b84\n\n(48)\n\nwhere the critical exponents are given by\n1 (1 \u2212 P )\n1\n\u03b82 \u2248 \u2212\n,\n\u03b81 \u2248 ,\n2\n2\n2|\u03b3|\n5 5(1 \u2212 P ) 8P\n1 8P\n,\n\u03b84 \u2248 \u2212\n+\n.\n\u03b83 \u2248 +\n2 |\u03b3|\n2\n2|\u03b3|\n|\u03b3|\n13\n\n(49)\n\n\fThe first term in Gp (x, t) arises from the choice of quantum numbers (\u2206Du , \u2206Db ) = (1/2, 0),\nwhilst the second term arises from the choice (\u2206Du , \u2206Db ) = (1/2, \u22121).\nThe leading order for the long distance asymptotics of the pair correlation function\nGp (x, t) oscillates with wave number \u2206kF , where \u2206kF = \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ). Meanwhile, the leading\norder for the spin correlation function Gz (x, t), which can also be thought of as the correlation of the density difference between spin-up and spin-down fermions, oscillates twice as\nfast with wave number 2\u2206kF . The oscillations in Gp (x, t) and Gz (x, t) are caused by an\nimbalance in the densities of spin-up and spin-down fermions, i.e., n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 , which gives rise\nto a mismatch in Fermi surfaces between both species of fermions. These spatial oscillations\nshare a similar signature as the Larkin-Ovchinikov (LO) pairing phase [2]. Our findings of\nthe wave numbers agree with those discovered through DMRG [7\u20139], QMC [12] and mean\nfield theory [14]. Though from conformal field theory, we see clearly that the spatial oscillation terms in the pair and spin correlations are a consequence of Type 3 excitations, i.e.,\nbackscattering for bound pairs and unpaired fermions. A comparison between our results\nand the results from numerical methods in Refs. [7\u20139, 12] suggest that the coefficient Ap,1\nis very much larger than the coefficient Ap,2 because the frequency of the oscillations in\nnumerical studies of Gp (x, t) is almost identical to \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ). This observation also applies\nto Gz (x, t), where Az,2 and Az,3 are much smaller when compared with Az,1 .\nThe correlation functions in momentum space can be derived by taking the Fourier transform of their counterparts in position space.

We plotted G\n\nthe curves more easily.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we investigated various zero-temperature correlation functions for the spin1/2 Fermi gas with attractive interaction. We derived the finite-size corrections for ground\nstate and low-lying excitations of the model. Using conformal field theory, critical exponents\nof the correlation functions were given in terms of polarization and interaction strength.\nWe found that the leading terms of the pair correlation function and the spin correlation\nfunction oscillate with frequencies \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ) and 2\u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ), respectively. We also found\nthat backscattering between the Fermi points of bound pairs and unpaired fermions results\nin a 1D analog of the FFLO state and displays a microscopic origin of the FFLO nature.\nFurthermore, we showed that there is a peak in the pair correlation function in momentum\nspace at k = \u03c0(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ) which confirms the oscillation frequency.\nIn the spin polarized phase, these correlation functions exhibit spatial oscillations with a\npower-law decay. This critical behaviour can be viewed as an analogy to long range order in\n1D, i.e., the power law decay of the pair correlation function which is regarded as evidence\nof a superconducting/superfluid state. We also like to mention that from the dressed charge\nformalism, the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions derived in this paper can\nbe numerically obtained with high accuracy for arbitrary interaction strength. Additionally, by considering weakly perturbed inter-tube interactions or inter-lattice interactions (1D\nfermionic Hubbard model), quasi-1D correlations in the spin polarized phase can be calculated from perturbation theory [19]. This provides a promising opportunity to estimate the\ncritical temperature for high-Tc superconductors/superfluids by studying 1D to 3D trapped\ncold atoms.\n16\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the Australian Research Council.
