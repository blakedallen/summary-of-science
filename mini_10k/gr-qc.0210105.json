In the limit of the extremal black hole the damping rate of charged and neutral\nperturbations coincides. Possible connection of this with the critical collapse in a\nmassive scalar electrodynamics is discussed.\n\nBlack hole (BH) quasinormal modes (QNM's) govern the decay of perturbations at\nintermediate times and are important when studying dynamics of black holes and external\nfields around them. Now, the interest in quasinormal modes is stipulated by three their\nfeatures. The first is connected with possibility of observing of QNM's, and of obtaining\nthe \"footprint\" of a black hole, with the help of a new generation of gravitational antennae\nwhich are under construction (see [1] for a review). The second concerns the Anti-deSitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence [2], from which it follows\nthat a large black hole in AdS space corresponds to an approximately thermal states in\nthe CFT. Thus the decay of the BH perturbations can be associated with the return\nto thermal equilibrium of the perturbed state in CFT [3]. Note that in AdS space,\nquasinormal modes of black holes govern the decay of a field at late times as well, since\nthere is no power-low tails and the decay is always exponential (see [3] and references\ntherein). The third feature is related to possible connection of BH QNM's in some spacetime geometries with the Choptuik scaling [3], [4], [5], [6].\nWhen Horowitz and Hubeny calculated massless scalar quasinormal modes for a fourdimensional SAdS black hole they found that for intermediate black holes, i.e. when the\nhorizon radius is of order the Anti-de Sitter radius (see also [7]), the striking approximate\nrelation takes place\n1\n(1)\n\u03c9Im \u223c r+ ,\n\u03b3\nwhere r+ is the horizon radius, \u03b3 is the Choptuik scaling parameter for a black hole being\nformed from a collapse of a scalar field in free space. Then, exact connection between the\nChoptuik scaling parameter and the imaginary part of the QNF's was obtained for the\n\n\fmassive scalar field in the background of the three-dimensional BTZ BH [4]. It gives us\na hope that such a connection between characteristic frequencies of black holes, at least\nin special space-time geometries, and parameters describing situation near the threshold\nformation of a black hole exists for all black holes. Thus knowledge of such relations\nwould be a most useful, since calculation of quasinormal modes is much simpler work\nthen numerical simulation of gravitational collapse.\nThen it was observed in [5] that since the nearly extremal RN BH background is\neffectively described by AdS2 black holes under a spherically symmetrical dimensional\nreduction [8], the relation between the scalar QN modes of the nearly extremal RN BH\nand the Choptuik scaling may be obtained.\nRecently it has been found that at the stage of quasinormal ringing the neutral perturbations, corresponding to a massless scalar field, will damp slower than the charged\nones for RN, RNAdS, and dialton black holes [6]. At very late times, on contrary, the\ncharged perturbations will damp slower, thereby dominating in a signal as was shown in\n[9]. In addition the damping rates (imaginary part of \u03c9) of charged and neutral quasinormal modes for massless scalar field coincide for the nearly extreme RN black hole\n[6]. This fact, although not understood, may be connected with the Choptuik scaling if\nremembering that the Choptuik scaling parameter \u03b3 is the same (0.37) both for charged\n[10] and neutral [11] massless scalar field collapse. The case of a massive scalar field is\nmore complicated from a critical collapse view. There both types of behavior appear (see\n[12] and references therein), I (with a mass gap) and II (when the black hole being formed\nmay be of infinitesimal mass) depending on ratio of the length scale of the initial data to\nthe inverse Compton wavelength characteristic of the field. Yet the critical collapse was\nstudied only for massless electrodynamics and for a massive scalar field. The complete\npicture of critical collapse for massive scalar electrodynamics is lacking as far as we are\naware. This gives us one of the reasons for studying the quasinormal spectrum associated\nwith decay of a charged massive scalar field.\nThe other reason is to find out how a massive scalar field, interacting also electromagnetically with a charged black hole, decay between an initial burst of radiation and\nthe late time tails. In this direction the evolution of a neutral massive scalar field at\nlate times was studied in [13] for a Schwarzshild background, in [17], [18], [19] for a RN\nbackground, and in [14] for the dilaton black hole. At the stage of quasinormal ringing,\ndecay of neutral massive scalar field was studied in [20] for Schwarzshild and Kerr black\nholes. The quasinormal modes of dilaton black holes were studied in [6], [15], [16].\nThe complete picture of a charged massive scalar field evolution in a charged black\nhole background is lacking at either stages.\nWe shall consider the evolution of the massive charged scalar field in the background\nof the Reissner-Nordstrom metric:\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f \u22121 (r)dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a922 ,\nwhere f (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n2M\nr\n\n+\n\nQ2\nr2\n\n(2)\n\n. The wave equation of the complex scalar field has the form:\n\n\u03c6;ab g ab \u2212 ieAa g ab (2\u03c6;b \u2212 ieAb \u03c6) \u2212 ieAa;b g ab \u03c6 + \u03bc2 \u03c6 = 0,\nQ\n,\nr\n\n(3)\n\nC is a constant. After representation of\nhere the electromagnetic potential At = C \u2212\nthe charged scalar field into spherical harmonics the equation of motion takes the form:\nQ\n(4)\n\u03c8,tt + 2\u0131e \u03c8,t \u2212 \u03c8,r\u2217 r\u2217 + V \u03c8 = 0,\nr\n2\n\n\fwhere\n\n2\nl(l + 1) 2M\n2Q2\n2Q\n2\nV = f (r)\n\u2212\ne\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u03bc\n,\nr2\nr3\nr4\nr2\n\n!\n\n(5)\n\n, and \u03c8 = \u03c8(r)e\u2212\u0131\u03c9t , \u03c9 =\nthe tortoise coordinate is defined by the relation dr \u2217 = fdr\n(r)\n\u03c9Re \u2212 i\u03c9Im . The effective potential goes to a constant at the horizon and at infinity. We\ncompute the quasinormal frequencies stipulated by the above potential using the third\norder WKB formula of S.Iyer and C.Will [21]:\n1\n\u2212 \u039b(n) \u2212 \u03a9(n) = n + ,\n2\n2Q\u2032\u20320\n\n\u0131Q0\nq\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u039b(n), \u03a9(n) are second and third order WKB correction terms depending on the\npotential Q and its derivatives in the maximum. Here Q = \u2212V + \u03c9 2 \u2212 2 eQ\n\u03c9. Since Q\nr\ngenerally depends on \u03c9, the procedure of finding of the QN frequencies is the following:\none fixes all the parameters of the QN frequency, namely, the multipole index l, the\novertone number n, of the black hole Q and M, and of the field m and e; then one\nfinds the value of r = r0 at which Q attains a maximum as a numerical function of \u03c9 and\nsubstituting it into the formula (6) one finds \u03c9 which satisfies the equation (6). Note that\nthe effective potential, being frequency dependent, is, generally, complex. Nevertheless,\nfollowing [21], we treat \u03c9 as if it were real when finding r0 and only continue Eq.(6) into\nthe complex frequency plane. We deal here with n = 0 modes as those dominating in a\nsignal.\nFirst we examine the behaviour of the neutral massive scalar field in a RN background. Recently in [18] through numerical simulation of the wave equation solution it\nhas been obtained that the relaxation process depends on the value M\u03bc: when M\u03bc \u226a 1\nthe relaxation depends on the field parameters and does not depend on the spacetime\nparameters, while at M\u03bc \u226b 1 the dependence on the black hole parameters appears. At\nthe stage of quasinormal oscillations the evolution of the massive scalar field governed by\nQNF's depends both on black hole and field parameters.\nQNF's for different values of \u03bc are presented on Fig.1- 3 for l = 1, 2, 3. The l = 0 modes\nare not given here, since the WKB accuracy is not sufficient in this case (nevertheless the\nmain conclusions as to the quasinormal behaviour conserve in this case as well). The real\npart of the quasinormal frequency, i.e. the oscillation frequency, grows with increasing\nof the mass field \u03bc, while the imaginary part of \u03c9, representing the damping rate, falls\ndown. Note that we are limited to the low-lying quasinormal frequencies whose real parts\ncorrespond to tunneling near the potential barrier (\u03c9 2 \u2248 Vmax ). In general, the maximum\nvalue of \u03bc (and of e for charged scalar field) depends upon the mode under consideration\n[20].\nNext, we investigate the massive charged scalar field case. The real part of \u03c9 as a\nfunction of imaginary part of \u03c9 is plotted for different l and Q for \u03bc = 0.1 on Fig.4-6.\nWe see that the neutral perturbations (e = 0) have less imaginary part than that of the\ncharged perturbations. Thus the charged perturbations decay faster. This repeats the\nbehaviour of the massless case [6]. When increasing charge Q, \u03c9Im grows up to some\nmaximum near Q = 0.8M and then falls down, while \u03c9Re increases monotonically. The\nmore e the less explicit this maximum.\nIn addition for the near extremal black hole the imaginary parts of charged and neutral\nperturbations tend to coincide as in a massless case.
