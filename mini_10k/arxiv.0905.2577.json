The physics\nof these phenomena is briefly highlighted, and their effects are shown on observable energy\nspectra from a future galactic supernova within 2\u03bd and 3\u03bd frameworks. Detection of such\neffects could provide a handle on two unknowns: the neutrino mass hierarchy, and the mixing\nangle \u03b813 .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeutrino flavour eigenstates (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ) are related to mass eigenstates (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 ) by means of\nan unitary matrix U , espressed in terms of three mixing angles \u03b8ij and one phase \u03b4 associated\nto possible CP violation.\nWe know rather precisely two squared mass differences (\u03b4m2 and \u2206m2 , with \u03b4m2 \u226a \u2206m2 )\nand two mixing angles (\u03b812 and \u03b823 ). However we do not know yet the sign of \u2206m2 (i.e., if the\nmass hierarchy is normal or inverted), nor the value of \u03b813 or of \u03b4. Some hints about the mass\nhierarchy and the mixing angle \u03b813 could come from future core-collapse supernova events in\nour galaxy (estimated to occur at a rate of a few per century).\nIn ordinary matter, neutrinos of all flavours are subject to neutral current interactions,\nwhereas \u03bde 's are also subject to charged current interactions on electrons. The \u03bde \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 interaction energy difference is described by the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfestein (MSW) matter potential\n\u221a\n(1)\n\u03bb(r) = 2 GF Ne (r) ,\nwhere Ne (r) is the electron number density; see 1 for a review.\nWhen the neutrino density is very high, as in core-collapse supernovae, \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd forward scattering may also become important 2 . Such interactions induce large, non-linear and collective\nflavour conversions. Since neutrinos of different flavours are coupled during their evolution\nhistory, collective effects are very different from neutrino oscillations in matter, and they are\ndescribed by means of the self-interaction potential \u03bc. For this purpose, for each species \u03bd\u03b1 , it is\nuseful to introduce the effective density n\u03b1 per unit of volume and of energy 3 . After energy integration, we get the total effective density of \u03bd (N = Ne +N\u03bc +N\u03c4 ) and of \u03bd\u0304 (N = N e +N \u03bc +N \u03c4 )\nper unit volume. The potential \u03bc, at any radius r, reads\n\u221a\n(2)\n\u03bc(r) = 2 GF [N (r) + N (r)] .\nFigure 1 4 shows the matter and self-interaction potentials (\u03bb and \u03bc), at a representative\n\n\f5\n\n10\n\n\u03bb, \u03bc (km-1)\n\n104\n3\n\n10\n\n102\n\n\u03bb\n\n10\n\n\u03bc\n\n1\n10-1\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nr (km)\nFigure 1: Radial profiles adopted for the matter (\u03bb) and self-interaction (\u03bc) potentials, in the range r \u2208\n[10, 250] km, at t = 5 s after the core-bounce.\n\ntime t = 5 s after the core-bounce, for a supernova spherically-symmetric bulb model 3 with a\nneutrinosphere radius R\u03bd = 10 km.\nThe typical range for the vacuum oscillation frequency \u03c9H = \u2206m2 /2E is \u03c9H \u2208 [0.1, 5.1] km\u22121\nfor \u2206m2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . Therefore, at small radii (r \u2208 [10, 200] km) self-interactions are not\nnegligible (\u03bc \u223c \u03c9). Usual MSW effects take place later (when \u03bb \u223c \u03c9) and, finally, vacuum\nmixing must also be considered.\nIn our reference supernova scenario 5 , we assume a galactic core-collapse supernova releasing\na binding energy EB = 3\u00d7 1053 erg, equally distributed among the six neutrino and antineutrino\nspecies, with luminosity decreasing with a time constant \u03c4 = 3 s. The unoscillated flux of the\nneutrino species \u03bd\u03b1 , per unit of area, time and energy, is then\nF\u03b10 (E, t) =\n\ne\u2212t/\u03c4 EB \u03c60\u03b1 (E)\n,\n\u03c4 24\u03c0R\u03bd2 hE\u03b1 i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we assume normalized thermal energy spectra \u03c60\u03b1 (E) 4,6,7 with average energy hE\u03b1 i. The\nnumerical values used for the mean energies are hEe i = 10 MeV, hE\u03bc,\u03c4 i = hE \u03bc,\u03c4 i = 24 MeV,\nhE e i = 15 MeV, where the bar labels antineutrinos.\n2\n\nCollective effects in a two-flavour scenario\n\nIn a core-collapse supernova, because of the typical neutrino energies [E \u223c O(10) MeV], \u03bd\u03bc\nand \u03bd\u03c4 are both below the threshold for \u03bc and \u03c4 production and have the same interactions.\nIn a two-flavour approximation, we can neglect the small mass difference \u03b4m2 and consider an\neffective two-family (\u03bde , \u03bdx ) scenario where \u03bdx is either \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 , and there are only two massmixing parameters, \u2206m2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 and sin2 \u03b813 < few %. We set sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22124 , but the\nprecise value is not very important in this context.\nIn the flavour basis, the neutrino system is described by a 2 \u00d7 2 density matrix for each\nenergy mode. Decomposing the density matrix over the Pauli matrices, the evolution of the\nsystem can be explained in terms of the Bloch vectors P and P (|P| = |P| = 1) , for \u03bd and\n\u03bd\u0304 respectively.

In inverted hierarchy, a full flavour swap takes place at\ncertain energies (Ec \u223c 7 MeV for \u03bd and E c \u223c 4 MeV for \u03bd\u0304, in our scenario) 4,8,9 . This\nfull flavour conversion is called spectral split and is an important signature of collective effects\n10,11,12,13 . It takes place only in inverted hierarchy, for any \u03b8 6= 0 14 . If the hierarchy is\n13\nnormal or if \u03b813 \u2261 0, then F\u03b1\u2032 \u2243 F\u03b10 for each \u03bd\u03b1 (i.e., there are no significant conversion effects).\n3\n\nSelf-interactions in a three-flavour scenario\n\nThe two-flavour approximation captures several features of collective effects. Are these effects unchanged in a three-flavour analysis? For this purpose, we have developed a framework\nwith three neutrino families 7 , using all three mixing angles (sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22126 , sin2 \u03b812 = 0.314,\nsin2 \u03b823 \u2208 [0.5, 0.36, 0.64]), both mass differences (\u03b4m2 = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and \u2206m2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 )\nand including the one-loop \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 matter potential correction 15 . We consider the evolution\nat four different times (t = 1, 5, 10, 20 s) after the core-bounce. The self-interaction and matter\npotentials are plotted in Fig. 3. We expect that collective effects take place at different radii\nfor different t, and MSW effects take place after collective ones. In this particular case, MSW\noscillations are not relevant because of the tiny value of \u03b813 chosen. According to this choice,\nafter collective effects, we have only to consider \u03b812 mixing to get the final \u03bd fluxes to the Earth.\nIn three generations, the density operator is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix in flavour basis.

The black,\ngreen, blue and magenta curves correspond to t = 1, 5, 10, and 20 s, respectively. In the left panel, the shaded\nhorizontal band marks the \u03bc range where bipolar effects develop. In the right panel, the shaded band marks the\nrange of \u03c9H for E \u2208 [1, 50] MeV, where MSW effects may develop, if the H-resonance condition (\u03bb \u223c \u03c9H ) is\nsatisfied and if sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22125 .\n\nIn the above equations, the first (vacuum) terms embed the squared mass splittings via \u03c9L,H\n(with \u03c9L = \u03b4m2 /2E), and the mixing angles via two \"magnetic fields\", BL,H 7 .

In fact the analogous of the third component of P in the two-flavour\napproximation is, in the three-flavour case, a linear combination of the third and eighth ones:\nP8\nPz \u2192 P3 + \u221a .\n3\n\n(9)\n\nFigure 4 shows the intermediate fluxes, F\u03b1\u2032 (E, t), at the end of collective effects (r \u2243 500 km)\nfor four different times after the core-bounce. Figure 5 shows the corresponding fluxes F\u03b1 (E, t)\nat the Earth i.e., including final vacuum mixing effects. Split signatures of collective effects\nare still visible in \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e fluxes of Fig. 5, and they are similar for different times after the\ncore-bounce. In view of prospective observations of galactic supernova neutrino bursts, the\npersistence of similar stepwise features for several seconds is useful, because we may expect to\nsee them also in time-integrated spectra. The x-flavour split features in Fig. 5 are suppressed\nby \u03b812 mixing with respect to Fig. 4.\nIn a two-flavour analysis a full flavour conversion (\u03bde , \u03bdx ) takes place above certain energies\n(E > Ec for \u03bd and E > E c for \u03bd\u0304), while in the three-flavour framework one linear combination\nof \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 remains a \"spectator\", so that:\nFe\u2032\n\n\u2243\n\n(\n\nFe0 (E < Ec )\nFx0 (E > Ec )\n\nand\n\n2Fx\u2032\n\n\u2243\n\n(\n\n(E < Ec )\n2Fx0\n0\n0\nFe + Fx (E > Ec )\n\n(10)\n\nand similarly is for antineutrinos. This limiting behavior is shown in Fig. 6: the solid curves\n(oscillated fluxes) exactly superimpose to the dashed ones (linear combinations of non-oscillated\nfluxes, as in Eqs. 10).\nSupernova neutrino fluxes are, in principle, sensitive to the specific value of \u03b823 . In fact if\n\u03b823 belongs to the first (second) octant, a leading \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) takes place, or if \u03b823 is\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n107\n\n20\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n104\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2 Fx = F\u03bc + F\u03c4\n\nFe\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE (MeV)\n\n50\n\n1\n\n10\n\n50\n\nE (MeV)\n\nFigure 4: Single-angle simulation in inverted hierar\u2032\nchy: Fluxes of \u03bd (F\u03b1\u2032 ) and \u03bd\u0304 (F \u03b1 ) for four different\nt after the core-bounce and at the end of collective\neffects, rescaled to d = 10 kpc.\n\n10\n\nFlux at 10 kpc (MeV-1 cm-2 s -1)\n\n1s\n5\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFlux at 10 kpc (MeV-1 cm-2 s-1)\n\nFlux at 10 kpc (MeV -1 cm-2 s-1)\n\nFlux at 10 kpc (MeV -1 cm-2 s-1)\n\n2 FIx = FI\u03bc + FI\u03c4\n\nFIe\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFe\n\n2 Fx = F\u03bc + F\u03c4\n\nFe\n\n2 Fx = F\u03bc + F\u03c4\n\n1s\n5\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n107\n\n20\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n104\n10\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n107\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n104\n1\n\n10\n\nE (MeV)\n\n50\n\n1\n\n10\n\n50\n\nE (MeV)\n\nFigure 5: Single-angle simulation in inverted hierarchy: Final oscillated fluxes of \u03bd (F\u03b1 ) and \u03bd\u0304 (F \u03b1 ) at\nd = 10 kpc (collective effects + vacuum propagation).\n\nmaximal, \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 fluxes are exactly equal 16 . This different behaviour in \u03bde conversion (in \u03bd\u03bc\nor in \u03bd\u03c4 ) according to the specific value of the mixing angle \u03b823 is shown in Fig. 7. Unfortunately,\n\u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 fluxes cannot be separately detected.\nAlthough collective split signatures are similar in two and three-flavour scenarios, it is worth\nstressing that the former is not a limit of the latter, because the \u03bd \u2212\u03bd interaction physics depends\non the absolute luminosities (which are different, if shared among two or three flavours).\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nNeutrino-neutrino interactions are not negligible when the neutrino density is very high, as in\ncore-collapse supernovae. \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd interactions are sensitive to the mass hierarchy and \u03b813 . In fact,\nif the hierarchy is inverted and \u03b813 6= 0, split features are observable in the spectra. Otherwise\nif \u03b813 = 0 or the hierarchy is normal, there are no significant conversion effects in general.\nA two-flavour approximation is useful to analyze the qualitative behavior; however the total\nneutrino luminosity influences the evolution, and it changes if it is distributed on two or three\nfamilies. As a consequence, three-generation analyses are important to validate the results.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported in part by the Italian \"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare\" (INFN)\nand \"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca\" (MIUR) through the \"Astroparticle Physics\" research project.
