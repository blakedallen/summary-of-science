Electr. \u2013 ULHT, Campo Grande 376, 1749-024 Lisboa, Portugal\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing the discovery by Hubble of the universe expansion [1] several global metrics describing cosmological expansion were derived, namely for flat [2], closed and open [3] isotropic universes. These results raised\nthe question whether local astrophysical systems are affected by the global universe expansion. In order\nto investigate this issue it is required to consider a metric that describes both local matter distributions,\nnamely point-like central masses, and global expansion, hence interpolating between the Schwarzschild\nmetric [4] (SC metric) near a central mass M and the specific metric describing global expansion. One\nof the first studies dealing with this problem was carried by McVittie assuming global isotropy [5] and\nemploying isotropic coordinates. However the McV metric has naked space-time singularities at the SC\nradius [6] such that space-time is not complete and the mass inside a shell of finite radius is divergent. More\nrecent developments on this problem considered the locally anisotropic CSC metric [7]. Experimentally\nthere is today evidence for local anisotropy, both from direct astrophysical measurements [8] as well as\nfrom the measurements of the cosmological microwave background radiation [9], hence local isotropy is\nnot mandatory as long as global isotropy is maintained. However the SCS metric has the same singularity\nbehavior of the McV metric. In the following we will analyze this problem obtaining an Expanding Locally\nAnisotropic (ELA) metric describing a singularity free space-time (except for the SC mass-pole) which has,\nas particular cases, both the isotropic McV metric and the locally anisotropic SCS metric.\nAccording to today's most recent data the universe is flat [9], hence global expansion is described by\nthe RW metric [2] (RW metric). We will work with radial coordinate r1 = ar, being r the coordinate for\nwhich the RW metric is diagonal. The radial coordinate r1 directly correspond to the measurable distances\n(it is an area radius). Following this convention the SC metric line-element is\n1 2\ndr \u2212 r12 d\u03a9 ,\nZ 1\nand the RW metric line-element describing a flat expanding universe is\nds2 = c2 Z dt2 \u2212\n\n2\nds2 = c2 (1 \u2212 NRW\n) dt2 + 2c NRW dr1 dt \u2212 dr12 \u2212 r12 d\u03a9 ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z = 1 \u2212 USC , USC is the Schwarzschild gravitational potential and NRW is the Robertson-Walker\nshift function\nr1\n2GM\n, NRW = H\n.\n(3)\nUSC = 2\nc r1\nc\nG is the Newton constant, c is the speed of light, H = \u0227/a is the time-varying Hubble rate defined as\nthe rate of change of the universe scale factor a and d\u03a9 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 is the solid angle line-element.\nThe only singularity of the space-time described by the SC metric (1) is the mass-pole (of value M ) at the\norigin, the scalar curvature R = g \u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 (the Ricci scalar) and the curvature invariant R = R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\nare\n8\u03c0 G\n48(GM )2\nRSC = \u2212 2 M \u03b4 (3) (r1 ) , RSC =\n.\n(4)\nc\nc2 r16\nAs for the space-time described by the RW metric (2) is singularity free, the scalar curvature and curvature\ninvariant are time-dependent only, RRW = \u22126(1 \u2212 q)H 2 /c2 and RRW = 12(1 \u2212 q 2 )H 4 /c4 , where q =\n\u2212(\u1e22/H 2 + 1) = \u2212a\u00e4/\u02272 is the time varying universe deceleration factor [10]. The SC metric has an event\nhorizon at the SC radius r1 = r1.SC = 2GM/c2 and the RW metric has an event horizon at the Hubble\nradius r1 = lH = c/H.\nThe McV metric [5] and the SCS metric [7] line-elements are, respectively,\n\u00112\n1 \u0010\n1\nds2McV = c2 Z dt2 \u2212\ndr1 \u2212 c NRW Z 2 dt \u2212 r12 d\u03a9 ,\nZ\n(5)\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndsSCS = c Z dt \u2212 (dr1 \u2212 c NRW Z dt) \u2212 r12 d\u03a9 .\nZ\nThe singular behavior of these two metrics at the origin r1 = 0 and at the SC radius r1 = r1.SC is obtained\nfrom the curvature invariant R. The leading expressions for these quantities are\n8\u03c0 G\nRMcV (\u223c 0) \u223c \u2212 2 M \u03b4 (3) (r1 )\nc\n8\u03c0 G\nRSCS (\u223c 0) \u223c \u2212 2 M \u03b4 (3) (r1 )\nc\n\n12(1 \u2212 q)2 H 4\n,\nZ2 4\n4(1 + q) H (GM )2\n,\n, RSCS (\u223c r1.SC ) \u223c\nc4 r12 Z 2\n\n, RMcV (\u223c r1.SC ) \u223c\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fAt the origin the singularities coincide with the Schwarzschild mass-pole, RMcV (r1 \u2192 0) = RSCS (r1 \u2192\n0) = RSC (4) and these space-times are singularity free outside the SC radius up to infinity, r1 > r1.SC , the\ncurvature invariants are finite. However, at the SC radius r1 = r1.SC , the space-time described by these two\nmetrics have extended singularities (over a sphere of fixed radius) such that space-time is not complete and\nthe mass inside of a shell of finite radius r1 > r1.SC is divergent. Moreover these are naked singularities,\nthe non-null connections \u0393100 and \u0393101 do not vanish at r1 = r1.SC . For the McV and SCS metric we obtain,\nrespectively,\nH4\nH2\n3\n1\n+\nr\n, (McV) \u0393101 (r1.SC ) = \u221e\n(McV) \u039300 (r1.SC ) = \u2212r1.SC\n1.SC\n2\n4\n(7)\n2c\nc\n1\n, (SCS) \u0393101 (r1.SC ) = 2H/c.\n(SCS) \u039300 (r1.SC ) = 0\nExpansion effects are negligible for relatively short scales astrophysical systems, the gravitational attraction law for space-times described by the SC metric, describes to a very good accuracy the dynamics\nof most astrophysical systems. Hence a singularity near massive objects is unwelcome, it means that the\nexpansion effects are dominant at the SC radius. From a theoretical perspective, naked extended singularities and divergent masses are also unwelcome and do not correspond to any physical meaningful reality. We\nwill next suggest a metric ansatz for which the event horizon is maintained at the SC radius and space-time\nis singularity free except for the mass-pole at the origin.\n\n2\n\nThe Metric Ansatz\n\nWe note that both the McV metric and the SCS metric (5) discussed above, are obtained from the SC\nmetric (1) by considering a shift function which is the product of the RW shift function NRW by a power\nof the factor Z = 1 \u2212 USC . This structure of the shift function ensures that:\n1. both spherical symmetry and the coordinate measure\n\n\u221a\n\u2212g = r12 sin \u03b8 are maintained;\n\n2. at spatial infinity the metric converges asymptotically to the RW metric (2), lim Z = 1;\nr1 \u2192\u221e\n\n3. for positive exponent \u03b1 > 0 of the factor Z at the SC radius, the metric converges to the SC metric (1),\nlim Z = 0.\nr1 \u2192r1.SC\n\nHence, a straight forward generalization of metrics (5) is\nds2 = c2 Z dt2 \u2212\n\n\u00112\n1 \u0010\n1\n\u03b1\ndr1 \u2212 c NRW Z 2 + 2 dt \u2212 r12 d\u03a9 ,\nZ\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an arbitrary exponent. The McV metric is obtained for constant exponent \u03b1 = \u03b10 = 0 and the\nCSC metric for \u03b1 = \u03b10 = 1.\nWe proceed to analyze the space-time represented by this metric. First we consider constant exponent\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 . We remark that the SC event horizon is maintained as long as the connections (\u03b10 ) \u039310\u03bc vanish\nat the SC radius, r1 = r1.SC . These conditions are obeyed for the lower bound \u03b10 > 1, for which the SC\nradius is an event horizon. As already discussed this result excludes both the McV and SCS metrics (7).\nThe space-time singularity behavior is obtained as usual from the curvature invariant R. At the\nSchwarzschild radius r1 = r1.SC , the limiting expressions for this quantity are\nR\u03b10\uf8f1(r1 \u2192 r1.SC ) \u223c\n\uf8f4 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u22124\n\u22122\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 12USC\n(1 + q)H 2 + 9(1 + q)2 H 4\n\uf8f2 12USC\n\u223c\nZ \u03b10 \u22123 \u2192 \u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 Z 2\u03b10 \u22124 \u2192 \u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u22121\nZ\n\u2192\u221e\n\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\n\u03b10\n\u03b10\n\u03b10\n\u03b10\n\u03b10\n\n\u2208]3, +\u221e[\n=3\n\u2208 [1, 3[\n\u2208] \u2212 \u221e, 1[/{0}\n=0\n\n(9)\n\nOnly for \u03b10 \u2265 3 the curvature invariant is finite, hence we conclude that the event horizon is singularity free only for this condition. In addition for \u03b10 > 5 both the scalar curvature and its derivative, as\n3\n\n\f\u2032\nwell all the components of the Ricci tensor, vanish at r1 = r1.SC , R(\u03b10 >5) (r1.SC ) = R(\u03b1\n(r1.SC ) =\n0 >5)\n(\u03b10 >5) R\u03bc\u03bd (r1.SC ) = 0 (here prime denotes differentiation with respect to r1 ) such that space-time is approximately Ricci flat in a neighborhood of the event horizon, hence coinciding with the properties of the\nspace-time described by the SC metric2 . This fact has no consequences in the remaining discussions presented here, it simply is interpreted as that, for \u03b10 > 5, in the neighborhood of the event horizon, the SC\nmetric is a very good approximation to the background space-time.\n\nAlthough the singularity at the event horizon is removed for constant exponent \u03b10 \u2265 3, the space-time\ndescribed by ELA metric (8) has a singularity at the origin more severe than the SC mass-pole. Specifically\nwe obtain\n1\n1\n(10)\nR\u03b10 \u22653 (r1 \u223c 0) \u223c \u03b10 , R\u03b10 \u22653 (r1 \u223c 0) \u223c 2\u03b10 .\nr1\nr1\nHence, to strictly maintain the SC mass-pole at the origin we are left with the only possible value for the\nconstant exponent \u03b10 = 3 for which space-time is not approximately Ricci flat in the neighborhood of the\nevent horizon r1 = r1.SC . We remark that the SC metric is usually used to describe space-time for most\nastrophysical systems and the estimative obtained agree to an high degree of accuracy with experimental\nmeasurements, hence we expect that near the massive central objects the properties of space-time coincide\nwith the ones of an SC space-time, in particular that it is approximately Ricci flat within a neighborhood\nof the event horizon3 . If we wish to maintain this possibility it is enough to consider a radial coordinate\ndependence of the exponent \u03b1 of the form\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 + \u03b11 USC\n\n, \u03b11 < 0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b11 is an arbitrarily small negative exponent which regularizes the singularity at the origin being its\neffects, for most purposes, negligible outside the event horizon r1 > r1.SC . This exponent can be justified\nby noting that it correspond to the first order expansion in the gravitational field of a generic spherically\nsymmetric exponent function.\nFor this exponent we obtain that the curvature invariant at the origin asymptotically coincides with\nthe respective quantity for the Schwarzschild metric independently of the value of the coefficient \u03b10 ,\nR\u03b10 ,\u03b11 <0 (r1 \u223c 0) = RSC (4). As for the SC radius we conclude that the event horizon is maintained\nfor \u03b10 + \u03b11 > 1 and space-time has the following properties\n\n3\n\n\u03b10 + \u03b11\n\n\u2265\n\n3 : space \u2212 time is singularity free at r1 = r1.SC ,\n\n\u03b10 + \u03b11\n\n>\n\n5 : space \u2212 time is locally Ricci flat at r1 = r1.SC .\n\n(12)\n\nEnergy-Momentum Density, Pressures and the Efective Equation of State\n\nIt is missing to analyze the densities and pressures. In the following we will explicitly show that the pressures\nare anisotropic and that, for small |\u03b11 | \u226a 1, the energy-momentum density is positive definite. Hence,\nneglecting the contributions of the radial dependence on the exponent outside the SC event horizon and\nusing the notation r\u03041 = c2 r1 /2GM for compactness of the equations, we obtain the following expressions\n2 We recall that the background of the SC metric corresponds to empty Ricci flat space-time, hence with R = R\u2032 = R\n\u03bc\u03bd = 0\neverywhere except at the origin due to the mass pole.\n3 The higher the value of \u03b1 , for a given accuracy, the greater the neighborhood for which space-time is approximately\n0\nRicci flat.\n\n4\n\n\ffor the energy density and pressures\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c1\n(\u03b10 ) pr\n(\u03b10 ) p\u03b8\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c1r , (\u03b10 ) pr , (\u03b10 ) p\u03b8\n\n= (\u03b10 ) p\u03c6\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\n\u03b10 \u2212 3\nH 2 \u03b10 \u22121\n=\n3\n+\n,\n\u03b4(r\n)\n+\nZ\n1\n2\u03c0 r12\n8\u03c0\nG\nr\u03041\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b10\n\u03b10 \u03b10 \u2212 1\n1\nc 2 H 2 \u03b10 \u2212 1\nZ 2 2 \u2212 3Z 2 + 2 ,\nZ 2 2 2(1 + q) \u2212\n=\n8\u03c0 G\nr\u03041\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc2 H 2 \u03b10 \u22122\n2(\u03b10 \u2212 3) \u03b10 (\u03b10 \u2212 5) + 6\n= \u2212\n3+\n+\nZ\n2\n8\u03c0 G\nr\u03041\n\u0012 2r\u03041\n\u0013\n2\n2\n\u03b10\n\u03b10 \u2212 4\nc H\n\u2212 32\n2\n2+\n(1 + q)Z\n+\n8\u03c0 G\n2r\u03041\n\n(13)\n\nThese expressions are plotted in figure 1 for distinct values of \u03b10 .\n1.0\n\u03a1\n\n0.10\n\n\u03a1\n\n0.5\n\u03a1 ; pr ; p\u0398\n\n\u03a1 ; pr ; p\u0398\n\n0.05\n0.0\npr\n\npr\n0.00\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.5\n\np\u0398\n\np\u0398\n\nHaL \u03910 =4\n\nHbL \u03910 =10\n\n-0.10\n\n-1.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\nr\u008f\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\nr\u008f\n\n1\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Scaled energy-momentum density \u03c1\u0304 = (8\u03c0G/H 2 )(\u03b10 ) \u03c1 and anisotropic pressures p\u0304r = (8\u03c0G/(cH)2 )(\u03b10 ) pr\nand p\u0304\u03b8 = (8\u03c0G/(cH)2 )(\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 for the ELA metric (8) with constant exponent (a) \u03b10 = 4 and (b) \u03b10 = 10.\n\nAs expected, at the origin, these quantities coincide with the respective ones for the SC metric and, at\nspatial infinity, with the ones for the RW metric. In addition we straight forward conclude that, although\nspherical symmetry is maintained ( (\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 = (\u03b10 ) p\u03c6 ), space-time is, generally, anisotropic ( (\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 6= (\u03b10 ) pr )\nbeing only asymptotically isotropic at spatial infinity. Furthermore, for \u03b10 \u2265 3, outside the event horizon,\nthe energy-momentum density is positive definite, being null only at the event horizon. This is a good\nfeature of the metric since it allows a standard matter interpretation with the above density distribution\nand a description in terms of an effective matter density. We also note that for \u03b10 > 5 all these quantities\nand respective derivatives are null at the event horizon r1 = r1.SC , (\u03b10 ) \u03c1 = (\u03b10 ) pr = (\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 = (\u03b10 ) \u03c1\u2032 =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u03b10 ) pr = (\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 = 0 coinciding with the respective SC metric quantities and consistently with space-time\nbeing approximately Ricci flat near the event horizon.\nAs for the anisotropic equations of state (\u03b10 ) \u03c9r =\nare plotted in figure 2 for several values of \u03b10 .\n\n2\n(\u03b10 ) pr /(c (\u03b10 ) \u03c1)\n\nHaL \u03910 =4\n\nand\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c9\u03b8\n\n=\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c9\u03c6\n\n=\n\n2\n(\u03b10 ) p\u03b8 /(c (\u03b10 ) \u03c1)\n\nHbL \u03910 =10\n\n25\n\n0.5\n20\n0.0\n\u03a9r ; \u03a9\u0398\n\n\u03a9r ; \u03a9\u0398\n\n15\n\n\u03a9r\n\n\u03a9\u0398\n\n10\n\n\u03a9r\n-0.5\n5\n\n\u03a9H\n\n0\n\n\u03a9\u0398\n\n-1.0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nr\u008f\n\n4\n\n\u03a9H\n5\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: The equation of state parameters (\u03b10 ) \u03c9r and\nwith constant exponent (a) \u03b10 = 4 and (b) \u03b10 = 10.\n\nBoth the parameters of the equation of state,\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr\u008f 1\n\n1\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c9\u03b8\n\nfor the ELA metric (8) and \u03c9H for the RW metric (2)\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c9r\n\n5\n\nand\n\n(\u03b10 ) \u03c9\u03b8 ,\n\ndiverge at the event horizon (this\n\n\fis due to the existence of the horizon itself) being positive near this horizon, as it is characteristic of\nstandard attractive matter, and as we move away for larger values of r1 , become negative due to the expansion effects. At spatial infinity both parameters converge to the RW metric equation of state parameter,\n\u03c9H = \u2212(1 \u2212 2q)/3. These results are consistent with the interpretation of the ELA metric (8) being an interpolation between the point-like matter distributions and the cosmological background, near the massive\nobjects standard matter interaction dominates while for large radii the repulsive effects (mostly due to the\ncosmological constant) dominate. However we note that a direct relation with the SC metric cannot be\ndrawn in this discussion. This metric has pSC = \u03c1SC = 0 everywhere except at the origin and an equation\nof state cannot be defined.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this letter we have presented a short derivation and analysis of an anisotropic metric (8) with a radial\ncoordinate exponent \u03b1 (11) describing point-like matter in an expanding background, hence interpolating\nbetween the SC metric (1) and the RW metric (2). For \u03b10 + \u03b11 \u2265 3 with \u22121 \u226a \u03b11 < 0, the SC event\nhorizon is mantained being non-singular and the singularity at the origin coincides with the SC mass-pole.\nFurthermore the energy-momentum density is positive definite outside of the event horizon allowing for a\neffective standard matter density interpretation. If it turns out that the ELA metric (8) correctly describes\nthe physical reality for specific values of the coefficients \u03b10 and \u03b11 it may solve the long standing puzzle\noriginally addressed by McVittie [5]. If possible to directly test this metric it will be, most probably,\nthrough its corrections to the gravitational attraction law for space-times described by the SC metric. We\nwill address this issue somewhere else [11].\nAcknowledgements\u2013 The author acknowledges and thanks the referee for comments and suggestions that\nsignificantly improved the manuscript.
