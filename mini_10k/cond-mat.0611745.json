The variance of experimental results as well\nas ab-initio calculations4 suggest that the environment\nand its influence via the vibrational modes (vibrons) of\nDNA are an important factor for the electronic transport\nproperties of DNA wires.\nNumerous recent articles addressed the electronic\nproperties in a microscopic approach5,6,7,8 . Typically,\nthe DNA is described within a tight-binding model for\nthe electronic degrees of freedom with parameters either\ntaken from ab-initio quantum chemistry simulations4,9,10\nor motivated by a fit to experiments. The variance of\nqualitatively different tight-binding models is large, ranging from involved all-atomic representations to models\nwhere each base pair is represented by only a single orbital.\nSeveral suggestions in the past stressed the importance\nof the environment and vibrational modes on the electron transfer11,12 and transport13,14 . However, the vibrons have been treated so far only within very simple\nmodels, where specifically only a local electron-vibron\ncoupling has been taken into account7 . If the coupling\nis sufficiently strong, this leads to the formation of polarons, i.e., a bound state of an electrons with a a lattice\ndistortion. While these approaches are sufficient to describe the transition from elastic (quasi-ballistic) to inelastic (dissipative) transport they ignore the fact that\nthe non-local electron-vibron coupling strength is comparable in magnitude to the local one4 . Furthermore, as\nthe non-local electron-vibron coupling leads effectively\nto a vibron-assisted hopping, the proper inclusion of this\ncoupling can be important for transport through the inhomogeneous sequences of 'natural' DNA.\n\nIn this paper we study electron transport through\ndouble-stranded DNA wires strongly coupled, both locally and non-locally, to vibrational modes of the DNA.\nThe DNA base pairs are represented by single tightbinding orbitals, with energies differing for GuanineCytosine (GC) and Adenine-Thymine (AT) pairs. The\nvibrational modes are also coupled to the surrounding\nenvironment (water or buffer solution) which we represent by a harmonic oscillator bath. This extension allows\nfor dissipation of energy and opens the possibility of inelastic transport processes. We address the influence of\nspecific DNA vibrational modes on transport in the frame\nof equation-of-motion techniques, with parameters motivated by ab-initio calculations4,10 .\nOur two main results are: 1) For homogeneous DNA\nsequences like Poly- (Guanine-Cytosine) wires the vibrons strongly enhance the linear conductance at low\ntemperatures. At large bias the vibrons affect the\nconductance only weakly, which remains dominated\nby quasi-ballistic transport through extended electronic\nstates. 2) For inhomogeneous ('natural') sequences almost all states are strongly localized, and transport is\ndominated by inelastic (dissipative) processes. In this\ncase, the presence of a non-local electron-vibron coupling,\nleading to 'vibron-assisted' electron hopping', influences\nthe conductance in a qualitative and quantitative way.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the following section we introduce the model and sketch briefly the techniques used to derive the transport properties. In Section III A we present our results for homogeneous DNA\nwires, while in Section III B we discuss a specific inhomogeneous DNA sequence, that has been studied in recent experiments. A summary is provided in Section IV.\nDetails of the applied technique can be found in the Appendix A.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMODEL AND TECHNIQUE\n15,16\n\nQuantum chemistry calculations\nshow that the\nhighest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a DNA\nbase pair is located on the Guanine or Adenine, whereas\nthe lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is located on the Thymine and Cytosine. Between HOMO\nand LUMO there is an energetic gap of approximately\n2 \u2212 3 eV. Experimental evidence hints to the prevalence\nof hole transport through DNA. Given the energetic and\nspatial separation of HOMO and LUMO and considering\nsufficiently low bias voltage we can represent in a minimal\nmodel one base pair by a single tight-binding orbital.\nWe consider a DNA sequence with N base pairs, the\nfirst and last of which are coupled to semi-infinite metal\nelectrodes. We further allow for a coupling to (in general\nmultiple) vibrational modes, that can be excited by local\nand non-local coupling to the charge carriers on the DNA.\nThese modes in turn are coupled to the environment.\nWhen later performing the numerical calculations we will\nrestrict ourselves to a single vibrational mode of the DNA\nbase pair, e.g., the 'stretch' mode4 .\nWe thus arrive at the Hamiltonian H = Hel + Hvib +\nHel\u2212vib + HL + HR + HT,L + HT,R + Hbath with\nHel =\n\nX\n\n\u01ebi a\u2020i ai \u2212\n\ni\n\nHT,L + HT,R\n\nX\n\ntij a\u2020i aj\n\ni,j;i6=j\n\ni\nXh\n\u2020\n=\ntrin c\u2020nr ai + tr\u2217\na\nc\nin i nr\nn,k,i\n\nHvib =\n\nX\n\n\u03c9\u03b1 B\u03b1\u2020 B\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nHel\u2212vib =\n\nXX\n\u03b1\n\n+\n\n\u03bb0 a\u2020i ai (B\u03b1 + B\u03b1\u2020 )\n\ni\n\nX X\n\n\u03bbij a\u2020i aj (B\u03b1 + B\u03b1\u2020 ) .

Both onsite energies and hopping depend on the base pair sequence, e.g., the on-site energy of a Guanine-Cytosine\nbase pair differs from the on-site energy of a AdenineThymine base pair. For the hopping matrix elements\ntij we used the values calculated by Siebbeles et al.10\nwho studied intra- and inter-strand hopping between\nthe bases in DNA-dimers by density functional theory\n(DFT). They computed direction-dependent values for\nall possible hopping matrix elements in such dimers.\nAdapting these results to our simplified model of base\npairs we obtain the hopping elements denoted in table I\n26\n.

The chemical details of the coupling\nbetween the DNA and the electrodes are not the focus\nof this work. For our purposes it is fully characterized\nby HT,L + HT,R , which leads to a level broadening of the\nbase pair orbitals coupled to the electrodes characterized\nby the linewidths \u0393L and \u0393R .\nThe vibronic degrees of freedom are described by Hvib ,\nwith bosonic operators B\u03b1 and B\u03b1\u2020 for the vibron mode\nwith frequency \u03c9\u03b1 . Hel\u2212vib couples the electrons on the\nDNA to the vibrational modes, where \u03bb0 and \u03bbij are\nthe strengths for the local and non-local electron-vibron\ncoupling, respectively. We further restrict the non-local\ncoupling terms to nearest neighbors, \u03bbij = \u03bb1 \u03b4i,j=i\u00b11 .\nNote that the vibron modes and their coupling to electrons is assumed independent of the base pairs involved,\nan approximation that is reasonable for some modes of\ninterest, including the base pair stretch mode4 . The\nstrength of the electron-vibron coupling for various vibrational modes has been computed in Ref. 4 for homogeneous dimers and tetramers of AT and GC pairs. Here\nwe consider also inhomogeneous sequences, for which the\nelectron-vibron couplings are not known. As a model\nwe take \u03bb0 and \u03bb1 as parameters, independent of the\nbase pairs involved, for which we choose values in rough\nagreement with estimates for the 'stretch' mode of Ref. 4.\nThis should be sufficient for a qualitative discussion of\nthe effects that arise from the electron-vibron coupling\nin DNA.\nThe vibrons are coupled to the environment, the microscopic details of which do not matter. We model it by\na harmonic oscillator bath Hbath , whose relevant properties are summarized by its linear ('Ohmic') power spectrum (or spectral function) up to a high-frequency cut-off\n\u03c9c 20 . The coupling of the vibrons to the bath changes the\nvibrons spectra from discrete (Einstein) modes to continuous spectra with a peak around the vibron frequency.\nPhysically, the coupling to a bath allows for dissipation\nof electronic and vibronic energy. This dissipation is crucial for the stability of the DNA molecule in a situation\nwhere inelastic contributions to the current dissipate a\nsubstantial amount of power on the DNA itself.\nAs mentioned before we only consider a single vibra-\n\n\f3\ntional mode when performing the numerical calculations.\nThis vibrational mode with resonance frequency \u03c90 coupled to the bath is then described by a spectral density\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b7(\u03c9)\n\u03b7(\u03c9)\nD(\u03c9) =\n,\n\u2212\n\u03c0 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )2 + \u03b7(\u03c9)2\n(\u03c9 + \u03c90 )2 + \u03b7(\u03c9)2\n(2)\nwith a frequency dependent broadening \u03b7(\u03c9) which arises\nfrom the vibron-bath coupling.

From the Green function obtained by this\nscheme we extract the physical quantities of interest,\nlike the density of states and the current. The EOM\ntechnique for an interacting system generates correlation\nfunctions of higher order than initially considered, resulting in a hierarchy of equations that does not close in itself.\nTherefore, an appropriate truncation scheme needs to be\napplied. In our case, we close the hierarchy on the first\npossible level neglecting all higher order Green functions\nbeyond the one defined above.

For simplicity, we couple the left and right electrodes symmetrically to the DNA, so \u0393L = \u0393R \u2261 \u0393, and\nwe choose \u0393 = 0.1 eV.

With the fairly small hopping\nelement of 0.119 eV (see Tab. I) for this finite system one\ncan still resolve the peaks due to single electronic resonances, especially near the van-Hove-like pile up of states\nnear the band edges. All states are delocalized over the\nentire system. The inset displays the elastic transmission, showing that the states have a high transmission of\nTel \u223c 0.5, with the states at the upper band edge showing the highest values. Both density of states and elastic\ntransmission show a strong asymmetry, which is a direct\nconsequence of the non-local electron-vibron coupling in\nthis model.\nTo further elucidate this connection we take a closer\nlook at the upper and lower band edge of the density\nof states (see Fig. 2).

The solid line shows\nthe purely electronic resonances.

The addition of a non-local electron-vibron coupling \u03bb1\n(dash-dotted line) introduces shifts of the resonance peaks to\nthe 'outside' (changing the effective band width) as well as a\nstrong asymmetry in the height of the resonances.\n\nheight, positioned at the energies corresponding to the\n'Bloch'-like states of this finite size tight-binding chain.\nIf we include only local electron-vibron coupling (dashed\nline), vibron satellite states appear, and the spectral\nweight of the original electronic resonances decreases,\nconsistent with the spectral sum rule.

The inclusion of vibrons increases the zerobias conductance at low temperatures (kB T roughly below\n~\u03c90 ) by several orders of magnitude. At room temperature,\nhowever, the zero bias conductance is slightly reduced. Inset:\nthe I-V -characteristics shows a 'semiconducting' behavior at\nroom temperature. The non-local electron-vibron coupling\n\u03bb1 increases both the non-linear conductance in the gap and\naround the threshold, leading to a slightly enhanced current.\n\nthe opposite sign of \u03bb1 the resonances shift to the 'inside'.\nFurthermore, a distinct asymmetry of the resonances is\nobserved, i.e. the upper band edge states have a larger\npeak height than the lower band edge states. This asymmetry in the density of states comes with a corresponding\nasymmetry in the elastic transmission, see Fig. 1 for the\noverall view.\nAs shown in Fig. 3 the coupling to vibrons strongly\nincreases the zero-bias conductance at low temperatures,\nwhereas at high temperatures the conductance slightly\ndecreases (dashed and dash-dotted line). This effect has\nbeen observed before, e.g. in Ref. 7. At low temperatures, the conductance is increased since the density of\nstates at the Fermi energy is effectively enhanced due to\n(broadened) vibronic 'satellite' resonances. The transport remains 'elastic', i.e. electrons enter and leave the\nDNA at the same energy (first contribution to the current Eq. 14). At sufficiently high temperatures, however,\nthe back scattering of electrons due to vibrons reduces the\nconductance in comparison to situation without electronvibron coupling (solid line).\nThe inset of Fig. 3 shows a typical I-V -characteristic\nfor the system. A quasi-semiconducting behavior is observed, where the size of the conductance gap is determined by the energetic distance of the Fermi energy to\nthe (closest) band edge. After crossing this threshold,\nthe current increases roughly linear with the voltage until\nat larger bias it saturates when the right chemical potential drops below the lower transmission band edge. Small\nstep-like wiggles due to the 'discrete' electronic states are\nvisible at low temperature (not shown), but are smeared\nout at room temperature. The current is dominated by\nthe elastic transmission, as expected for a homogeneous\nsystem.\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Density of states of an inhomogeneous DNA with sequence (5'-CAT TAA TGC TAT GCA\nGAA AAT CTT AG-3'). We chose the following parameters: GC on-site energy \u01ebG = \u22120.35 eV, AT on-site energy\n\u01ebA = \u22120.86 eV , Fermi energy EF = 0 eV, vibron energy\n~\u03c90 = 0.01 eV, cutoff ~\u03c9c = 0.03 eV, linewidth \u0393 = 0.1 eV\nand room temperature kB T = 0.025 eV. The density of states\nis fragmented into 'bunches' of strongly localized states with\nvery low elastic transmission.\n\nThe non-local coupling has a quantitative effect on the\nnature of the I-V -curve. The zero bias conductance as\nwell as the non-linear conductance around the threshold\nare increased by close to a factor 1.2. This increase is directly related to the enhancement of the density of states\nand elastic transmission around the upper band edge (see\nFigs. 1 and 2).\n\nB.\n\nInhomogeneous DNA\n\nInhomogeneous DNA sequences show a transport behavior which differs significantly from that of the homogeneous Poly-(GC) sequence. As a specific example,\nwe analyze the sequence 5'-CAT TAA TGC TAT GCA\nGAA AAT CTT AG-3' (plus complementary strand),\nwhich has been investigated experimentally by Porath et\nal.24 . The density of states is displayed in Fig. 4. Rather\nthan traces of bands it now shows discrete 'bunches' of\nstates due to the disorder in the sequence. All states\nare strongly localized, extending over at most a few base\npairs25 . The right-most (largest energy) bunch of states\nis due to the GC base pairs. Two of these GC pairs are\nthe only base pairs that are directly coupled to the metallic electrodes. Note that the equilibrium Fermi level is set\nat EF = 0 eV, roughly 0.35 eV above these states. The\nfirst states with mostly AT character are located around\n\u22120.7 eV.\nAs to be expected the elastic transmission through\nthese localized states is extremely low. The largest contribution to the elastic transmission stems from the ATlike states around an energy \u01ebA = \u22120.86 eV (note that\nthe considered sequence is AT rich).

Parameters are the same as in Fig. 4. The inclusion of a non-local\nelectron-vibron coupling \u03bb1 leads to changes in the conductance, depending on the nature of the relevant state.\n0.6\nCATTAATGCTATGCAGAAAATCTTAG\n\nVb=1V\n\n0.5\n0.4\nI (\u03bcA)\n\nthe parameters we use. Consequently, the 'elastic' quasiballistic transmission of electrons is completely negligible\nfor the considered sequence.\nIn spite of the localization of the electron states, a\nrather significant current can be transmitted, as displayed in Fig. 5. It is due to the inelastic contributions\nto transport, where electrons dissipate (or absorb) energy\nduring their motion through the DNA. Roughly speaking, the transported electrons excite the vibrons which in\nturn either dissipate their energy to the environment or\n'promote' other electrons, thus increasing their probability to hop to neighboring but energetically distant base\npairs. This inelastic transmission strongly depends on\nthe specific states (in contrast to the band-like transmission for the homogeneous sequence). As a consequence,\nthe inelastic transmission of different states can differ by\nseveral orders of magnitude. Together with the bunched\ndensity of states this leads to the step-like behavior for\nthe current displayed in Fig. 5. The first step centered\naround Vb \u223c 0.7 V roughly corresponds to states with GC\ncharacter, whereas the second step corresponds to states\nwith mixed AT-GC character at \u22120.7 eV. Here, the GC\nstates display a larger inelastic transmission as can be\nseen from the large non-linear conductance peak around\nVb \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.7 V (see inset of Fig. 5).\nThe non-local electron-vibron coupling \u03bb1 for this\nsequence leads to qualitative change of the I-V characteristics, depending on the details of the nature of\nthe states and therefore explicitly on the DNA sequence.\nThe current on the lowest bias plateau is increased relative to the case with only local electron-vibron coupling,\nalthough the GC states do barely shift towards the Fermi\nenergy. However, the inelastic transmission of the states\nis slightly increased (see inset), leading to an increased\ncurrent on the first plateau (dashed line).\nIn contrast, the conductance due to states with mixed\nAT-GC nature is much reduced (almost by a factor of\ntwo, see middle peak in the inset of Fig. 5) which leads\nto a smaller increase of the current for the middle step.\nObviously, the transmission of these mixed states is reduced by the 'vibron assisted electron hopping'. On the\nother hand, the last step at \u223c 2V is almost unaffected.\nWhile the changes of the I-V -characteristics due to\nnon-local electron-vibron coupling are relatively small\nfor the present sequence and model parameters, the observed sensitivity of the inelastic transmission suggests\nthat other sequences could display much larger effects.\nFurthermore, quantum chemistry calculations4 suggest\nthat the local and non-local electron-vibron couplings can\nbe of the order of \u223c 10 meV, i.e. larger than what we\nconsidered here. Inhomogeneities in the electron-vibron\ncoupling, not covered in the present calculation, might\nhave a further impact.\nThe DNA sequence we considered was investigated in\ntransport experiments, and we should compare the experimental and theoretical results. As some important\nfactors are still not well determined, a quantitative comparison is not feasible. However, we observe both in\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\u0393 (eV)\n\n0.1\n\nFIG. 6: Current at a bias of Vb = 1 V as a function of\nelectrode-DNA coupling \u0393 for the inhomogeneous DNA with\nsequence (5'-CAT TAA TGC TAT GCA GAA AAT CTT AG3'). Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 4. The current\nis a non-monotonous function of \u0393 and peaks around a value\n\u0393max where the imaginary part of the vibron self energy \u03a3vib\nis of the same size as \u0393.\n\nexperiment and theory roughly a 'semiconducting' I-V characteristics with (sometimes) steplike features. The\nsize of the currents is roughly comparable, of the order\nof \u223c 80 nA at a bias of Vb = 1 V. As the choice of the\nposition of the Fermi energy defines the size of the 'semiconducting' gap, this gap could be adjusted to fit the\nexperiment. On the other hand, the value of the current\nfor this sequence (with parameters derived from quantum chemistry calculations) can not be simply scaled by\nchanging a single 'free' parameter like the electrode-DNA\ncoupling \u0393.\nFor the case of the homogeneous sequence, the current\nat a given bias (say, at Vb = 1 V) grows monotonically\nwith increasing \u0393 (as long \u0393 is smaller than the hopping amplitude tij ), as is expected from quasi-ballistic\nLandauer-type transport. In contrast, for the inhomoge-\n\n\f7\nneous sequence, the current is a non-monotonic function\nof \u0393, see Fig. 6. In particular, the current at the first\nplateau (at Vb = 1 V) initially grows as we decrease \u0393\nfrom the value used in the above figures (\u0393 = 0.1 eV),\nup to a point at which the imaginary part of the vibron\nself energy \u03a3vib is of the same size as \u0393. This happens\naround \u0393max \u223c 0.01 eV. The current at \u0393max is of order\nof \u223c 500 nA. If \u0393 is decreased further, the current drops\nrapidly from the maximal value.27 On the other hand, if\n\u0393 is increased above the value \u0393 = 0.1 eV, the current\nalso drops initially, before at very large \u0393 quasi-ballistic\ntransport becomes dominant and the current increases\nagain (not shown in the figure).\nSummarizing these results, we conclude that for the\ngiven model parameters, i.e. for values of \u0393 in the large\nrange 1 \u2212 200 meV, likely to be realistic for present-days\ntransport experiments in DNA, the current at the first\nplateau lies in the range of 50 \u2212 500 nA.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo summarize, we have presented a technique that allows the computation of electron transport through short\nsequences of DNA, including local and non-local cou-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n\nE.

Using an equation-of-motion approach we identify elastic\nand inelastic contributions to the current. For homogeneous DNA sequences, the transport is dominated by\nelastic quasi-ballistic contributions through a band-like\ndensity of states (Fig. 1,2), which display an asymmetry\ndue to the non-local electron-vibron coupling. The coupling to vibrations strongly enhances the zero-bias conductance at low temperatures. The current at finite bias\nabove the 'semiconducting' gap, however, is only quantitatively modified by the non-local electron-vibron coupling (Fig. 3). For inhomogeneous DNA sequences, the\ntransport is almost entirely due to inelastic processes,\nthe effectiveness of which is strongly sequence dependent (Fig. 4). For the considered example sequence the\nnon-local electron-vibron coupling qualitatively modifies\nthe I-V -characteristics (Fig. 5). We also point out that\nthe current through inhomogeneous DNA sequences depends non-monotonically on the electrode-DNA coupling\n\u0393 (Fig. 6).\nAcknowledgments.

The hopping integrals between two purines\ndepend on the specific bases involved and to which strands\nthese two bases belong to. The values we used, were the\nvalues for the hopping integral J of the first, second and\nfifth row in the table 3 of Ref. 10. They are exactly reproduced in our table 1.\nNote that our assumption \u0393 >> \u03bb0 breaks down at some\npoint. Nevertheless, the decrease of the current at very\nsmall \u0393 makes physical sense.\n\n\f8\nAPPENDIX A: EQUATION OF MOTION\n\nBefore applying the equation of motion we separate\nthe retarded electron Green function into two parts,\noE\nDn\nGret\nak (t)\u03c7(t), a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\nkl (t) = \u2212i\u03b8(t)\nE\nD\n= \u2212i\u03b8(t) ak (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n{z\n}\n|\n(1)\nGkl (t)\n\nD\nE\n\u2212i\u03b8(t) a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 ak (t)\u03c7(t) .\n|\n{z\n}\n\n(A1)\n\nD\n\naj (t)B\u03b1 (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n\nE\nX X 2 \u03bbij \u03bb0 D\nak (t)a\u2020i (t)aj (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n+\n\u03c9\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nwhere H0el and H0vib are the electronic and vibronic parts\nof H0 .\nAfter some straight-forward algebra (cf Ref. 19) we obtain\nH0vib\n\nand consequently\nE\nD\naj (t)B\u03b1 (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n\n= F\u03b1 (t) \u03c7(t)\u03c7\u2020\n\nH0vib\n\n(A5)\n\nD\nE\nE X\nD\n\u2217\ncn (t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020l\nVnk\n\u03bb0 ak (t)\u03c7(t)B\u03b1\u2020 (t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 +\nn\n\nH0\n\nUsing the above approximations we obtain after\nFourier transformation and crossover to the continuous\nsprectrum\nX\n(1)\n[(E \u2212 \u01ebk )\u03b4jk + tkj ] Gjl (E)\nj\n\nD\nE\n(1)\n= ak a\u2020l \u2212 \u2206Gkl (E)\n(\nZ\nX X D \u2020 E 2\u03bbij \u03bb0 (1)\n+ d\u03c9D(\u03c9) \u2212\naj ai\nGkl (E)\n\u03c9\ni j6=i\nE 2\u03bb \u03bb\nXXD\nij 0 (1)\n+\nak a\u2020i\nGjl (E)\n\u03c9\ni j6=i\n\u0015\nX \u03bbkj \u03bb0 \u0014Z\n(1)\niEt\ndte [F1 (t, \u03c9) \u2212 1] Gjl (t)\n+\n\u03c9\nj6=k\n\u0014Z\n\u0015)\n\u03bb20\n(1)\niEt\ndte F1 (t, \u03c9) Gkl (t)\n+\n\u03c9\nX\nX\n(1)\n(1)\n\u03a3R\n(A8)\n\u03a3Lkj Gjl (E) +\n+\nkj Gjl (E)\n\n)\n\n(A2)\n\n(2)\n\nand a similar relationD for Gkl (t).\nE\nThe expressions aj (t)B\u03b1 (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 and similar\nhigher order correlation function are approximated by\nassuming\nE\nE\nD\nD\n.\n\u2248 F\u03b1 (t) aj (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 (A3)\naj (t)B\u03b1 (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n\nj\n\nH\u0304\n\nThe function F\u03b1 (t) is obtained by considering a Hamiltonian H0 without electron-vibron coupling and calculating the same higher order correlation function\n\nH0\n\nE\nD\n(A6)\n.\n= F\u03b1 (t) aj (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\n\nBecause the strength of the electron-vibron coupling in\nH\u0304 is proportional to \u03bb1 , this approximation is valid for\nnot too large valuesD of \u03bb1 .\nE\nExpressions like a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 ak (t)a\u2020i (t)aj (t)\u03c7(t) are treated\nin a mean-field like manner:\nE\nD\nak (t)a\u2020i (t)aj (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\nE\nD\nED\n\u2248 ak (t)a\u2020i (t) aj (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020\nD\nED\nE\n\u2212 aj (t)a\u2020i (t) ak (t)\u03c7(t)a\u2020l \u03c7\u2020 .\n(A7)\n\ni,j;j6=i\n\nH\u0304\n\n0\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nH0\n\n(A4)\n\nB\u03b1 (t)\u03c7(t)\u03c7\u2020\n\nThis is necessary, because for Gkl (t) and Gkl (t) selfconsistency equations can be derived via the equationof-motion technique (EOM) (The equation of motion applied to the retarded Green function Gret\nkl (t) leads to an\nequation containing not only the retarded Green function). The EOM technique for an interacting system\ngenerates a hierarchy of correlation functions that does\nnot close in itself. Therefore, an appropriate truncation\nscheme needs to be applied.
