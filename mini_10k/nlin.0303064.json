To a large extent this is due to its various applications, ranging from laser dynamics [2] to electronic circuits [3], chemical and biological systems [4], secure communications [5], etc. But there is also a pure theoretical interest in this phenomenon, that is related perhaps to\nits counterintuitive nature: how it is possible that chaotic (i.e.,\nby definition unpredictable) systems can be synchronized and\nthus brought under some 'control'. And, even more puzzling,\nnoise can play the role of the synchronizing factor. Indeed,\nearly reports [6] that sufficiently strong noise can completely\nsynchronize two identical chaotic systems were initially met\nwith scepticism and attributed to finite precision of computations [7] or to biased noise [8]. However, more recent examples show this effect even for unbiased noise [9].\nSince real systems are typically nonidentical, complete synchronization is difficult to achieve. It is an interesting problem\nto examine whether noise can induce some sort of 'weaker\nsynchronization' in nonidentical but relatively similar systems. Recent works do show the existence of such partial\nsynchronization [10, 11].\nOne important problem of the theoretical and numerical\nstudies of synchronization is how to detect it. This problem\nis essentially solved for the complete synchronization of two\nidentical systems that are described by variables x and x\u2032 , respectively. In this case, for the synchronized state the difference |x \u2212 x\u2032 | equals zero, while it remains positive in the\nunsynchronized state. Moreover, the transition between these\ntwo states is accompanied by the change of the sign of the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent, that becomes negative in the synchronized state.\nHowever, for the partial synchronization this problem is\nmuch more subtle. In this case, the two systems are not identical and the difference |x \u2212 x\u2032 | always remains positive. It has\nalready been noted for some models with continuous dynamics that partial synchronization manifests through changes\nin the probability distribution of the 'phase difference' [11].\nIn addition to that, in the partially synchronized phase the socalled zero Lyapunov exponent becomes negative [10, 11].\nStudies of synchronization rely, to a large extent, on nu-\n\nmerical calculations. Precise estimations of Lyapunov exponents or probability distributions (invariant measures) constitute very often demanding computational problems. To further test the already accumulated knowledge on synchronization, it would be desirable to find models where at least some\nof these properties could be computed analytically.\nIn the present paper we examine synchronization of random one-dimensional linear maps. For such maps one can\neasily find the exact Lyapunov exponent and locate the point\nwhere it changes sign. Numerical calculations for two identical systems confirm that this is also the point where a complete synchronization transition takes place. We briefly report\non a correspondence between such maps and a random walk\nprocess, that allows for a simple interpretation of the initial\nstages of the evolution of the maps.\nWe also examine the partial synchronization of nonidentical maps. It is seen that the way partial synchronization\nmanifests depends on the type of difference between the nonidentical systems. In a certain case, the difference in the location of contraction points of the maps is imprinted in the\nprobability distribution at the partial synchronization transition. When the difference between two subsystems \u03b4 tends to\nvanish, partial synchronization approaches the complete synchronization. Due to the exact knowledge of the complete\nsynchronization point, one can examine some details of this\ncrossover. In particular, it is shown that for \u03b4 \u2192 0, vanishing\nof the synchronization error is very slow \u223c (\u22121/log10 \u03b4).\n\nII. RANDOM 2-MAPS\n\nFirst, let us consider the simplest example of a random linear map\nxn+1 = fi (xn ), i = 0, 1 and n = 0, 1, . . .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere at each time step n one of the maps f0 or f1 is applied\nwith a probability p and (1 \u2212 p), respectively. The maps are\ndefined as f0 (x) = a x mod(1), and f1 (x) = b x, where\n0 < x < 1 and a > 1, 0 < b < 1. Related models\nhave already been examined in the context of on-off intermittency [12, 13], advection of particles by chaotic flows [14],\nand others [15, 16]. Some aspects of synchronization were\n\n\f2\n\nN \u22121\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 dx\n1 X\n\uf8e6 n+1 \uf8e6\nlog10 \uf8e6\n\uf8e6.\nN \u2192\u221e N\ndxn\nn=0\n\n\u03bb = lim\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\n-4\n-6\n\np=0.45\n-10\n\n\u03bb = p log10 a + (1 \u2212 p) log10 b .\n\n-12\n0\n\nIt follows that \u03bb changes sign at\np = pc =\n\n\u2212log10 b\n.\nlog10 (a/b)\n\n(4)\n\nIt is easy to understand this result. For p > pc the expanding (chaotic) map f0 prevails over the contracting map f1 and\nthe overall behaviour is chaotic with \u03bb > 0. The opposite\nsituation takes place for p < pc and the map (1) contracts to\nx = 0. At p = pc and in its close vicinity the map (1) exhibits\nintermittent bursts of activity [12, 13], but we will not focus\non such a behaviour in the present paper.\nTo study synchronization one can make two runs {xn } and\n{x\u2032n } of iterations of map (1) starting each time from (slightly)\ndifferent initial conditions x0 and x\u20320 but with the same realization of noise, i.e., with the same sequence of maps fi . Then\none measures the synchronization error wn defined as\nwn = h|xn \u2212 x\u2032n |i ,\n\np=0.35\n\n0.002\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nn\n200 400 600 800 1000\n800\n\nn\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nFIG. 1: The logarithm of the synchronization error wn as a function of time n for the map (1) with a = 1/b = 3/2, for different\nvalues of p. The mean in wn was taken over 1010 realizations of the\nrandom trajectories, and the initial points were x0 = x\u20320 /2 = 10\u22129 .\nThe diamonds locate the maximum \u03c4P of the corresponding probability P (n; p, y0 = 50). The inset shows a typical such first-passage\nprobability P (n; p = 0.55, y0 = 50) for the corresponding random\nwalker to go from y0 to 0 in n steps.\n\n(c) For even smaller values of p the synchronization error wn\ndecreases exponentially already from the beginning.\nTo understand the initial behaviour of wn , let us recall that\nthe iteration of xn and x\u2032n starts from very small values and\nfor a certain number of iterations the mod(1) part of the map\n(1) does not play any role. Consequently, one has\n\n(5)\n\nwhere h...i represents the mean over the realizations of the\nnoise. Moreover, we introduce the steady-state average w =\nlimn\u2192\u221e wn . In the synchronized state w = 0 while it is positive in the unsynchronized state. Our numerical results for\na = 1/b = 3/2 (not presented here) show that w vanishes at\np = 1/2, i.e., the point where the Lyapunov exponent changes\nsign.\nHowever, due to the fact that it contracts to x = 0 for p <\npc , the map (1) is not quite suitable to study synchronization\nof chaotic systems. For such a purpose it would be desirable\nto have a map with a somehow more complex behaviour in the\nregime with a negative Lyapunov exponent.\nNevertheless, the simplicity of the map (1) allows us to get\nsome additional insight into its dynamics. Let us fix the initial\npoints of our maps as, e.g., x0 < x\u20320 \u226a 1. As we shall see,\nsuch a choice results in a certain transient regime that can be\nunderstood using an analogy with a random walk process.\nNumerical evaluation of wn shows that it exhibits three\ntypes of behavior as a function of time n (Fig. 1).\n(a) For p > pc (positive Lyapunov exponent) after an initial exponential increase, wn saturates and acquires a constant\nnonzero value.\n(b) For p . pc , wn decreases after an initial exponential increase. The asymptotic exponential decay is consistent with\nthe (negative) Lyapunov exponent (3).\n\nP(n;0.55,50)\n\n0.004\n\n-8\n\nIndeed, since both f0 and f1 have constant derivatives, one\nimmediately obtains\n(3)\n\np=0.55\np=0.525\n\n-2\n\nlog10(wn)\n\nalso studied for piecewise linear random maps, but both the\nLyapunov exponent and the location of the synchronization\ntransition were determined only numerically [17].\nFor the map (1) it is elementary to calculate exactly its Lyapunov exponent \u03bb defined as\n\nwn = h\u03b1in w0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nh\u03b1i = p a + (1 \u2212 p) b .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nCorrespondingly, the initial decrease or increase of wn depends whether p is smaller or greater than (1 \u2212 b)/(a \u2212 b).\nAfter a certain time, the mod(1) part of the map comes\ninto play and the initial behaviour of wn (6) is replaced by a\ndifferent one. Namely, for p > pc , wn saturates at a nonzero\nvalue and it decays exponentially for p < pc . We shall return\nto this point at the end of this section.\nTo estimate the time scale \u03c4 when the inital behaviour (6)\nchanges, we relate our map to a random walk process. For\nsimplicity, we consider the case b = 1/a. In this case there\nis a one-to-one correspondence between the stochastic variable xn and yn = \u2212loga (xn ). Multiplication of xn by a or\n1/a corresponds to the decrease or increase of yn by unity.\nConsequently, yn is nothing else but the position of a random\nwalker on a lattice of unit spacing with transition probabilities p to the left and (1 \u2212 p) to the right. The correspondence\nwith the random walk holds as long as the mod(1) part of the\nmap is not applied, i.e., the walker does not cross loga (1) = 0.\nThe above random-walker problem has two characteristic time\nscales connected to the first-passage process [18] from its initial position to 0, and one can expect that one of them is related to \u03c4 [which is, recall, the time scale on which the initial\n\n\f3\n\nwhere y0 is the initial position of the walker and n is the\nnumber of steps; the binomial coefficient is to be interpreted\nas zero if (n \u2212 y0 )/2 is not an integer in the interval [0, n].\nOur numerical simulations show (see Fig. 1) that the value of\nn = \u03c4P for which P (n; p, y0 ) in Eq. (8) attains a maximum\noffers a reasonable estimation of \u03c4 . One cannot expect to get\na more precise estimate of \u03c4 , since the change of the initial\nbehavior (6) of the map towards the asymptotic one is a gradual process, that involves all the trajectories of the equivalent\nrandom walker that hit 0 (for the first time) before as well as\nafter \u03c4P .\nLet us notice that the bias of the random walk is related\nwith the sign of the Lyapunov exponent and therefore with the\nasymptotic behaviour of our map. Indeed, for p < pc = 1/2\nthe random walk is biased toward +\u221e, that translates into an\nexponential decay of wn . Our numerical simulations for the\nlonger time regime suggest that this decay is governed by the\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb (3). Recall that \u03bb is known to govern\nthe evolution of the typical value of |xn \u2212 x\u2032n | (see, e.g., [16]).\nThus in the long-time regime the mean wn and the typical\nvalue of |xn \u2212 x\u2032n | behave identically. On the other hand,\nthey are clearly different in early-time regime. It means that\nin this regime wn is strongly influenced by rare events, i.e.,\nunlikely excursions of the random walker against the bias. For\np > pc = 1/2 the random walk is biased toward 0 and, since\nthe map is bounded, wn saturates at a positive value.\nIII.\n\nRANDOM 3-MAPS\n\nAs already mentioned, the map (1) has a trivial behaviour\nfor p < pc and is not suitable to study synchronization of\nchaotic systems. In this context the following 3-map version\nis more interesting:\nxn+1 = fi (xn ), i = 0, 1, 2,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere f0 (x) = a x mod(1), f1 (x) = b x, and f2 (x) = b x +\n(1 \u2212 b). The maps f0 , f1 , and f2 are applied at random with\nprobabilities p, (1 \u2212 p)/2, and (1 \u2212 p)/2, respectively. It is\neasy to show that for such a random map Eqs.

For p > pc = 1/2 the\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb is positive and the system is not synchronized (w > 0).

The unnormalized probability\ndistribution P (x) of visiting a point x for p = 0.4 (synchronized\nphase) is shown in the inset. The data were collected in 104 bins.\nComplex probability distributions are known to appear also for some\nother random linear maps [15].\n\nsystem synchronizes (w = 0). But this time the behaviour for\np < 1/2 is much more complex. The two maps f1 and f2\nare still contracting ones, but to two different points (0 and 1).\nSince they are applied randomly, the system, while remaining\nsynchronized, irregularly wanders throughout the whole interval (0, 1). The probability density P (x) of visiting a given\npoint x, that is shown in the inset of Fig. 2, confirms such a\nbehaviour.\nRandom linear maps can be also used to study partial synchronization that might occur for two dynamical systems that\nare not identical, although relatively similar. Generally, one\nconsiders the following pair of maps\nxn+1 = fi (xn ), x\u2032n+1 = fi\u2032 (x\u2032n ), i = 0, 1, 2 ,\n\n(10)\n\nfor which {f0 , f0\u2032 }, {f1 , f1\u2032 }, and {f2 , f2\u2032 } are applied\nat random with probabilities p, (1 \u2212 p)/2, and (1 \u2212 p)/2,\nrespectively. To complete the definition we have to specify\nthe functions fi and fi\u2032 , i = 0, 1, 2. We present below the\nresults for two particular choices. These ones correspond,\nrespectively, to a perturbation of the Lyapunov spectrum case (A) - and of the attractor - case (B).\nCase (A): We choose\nf0\u2032 (x) = a\u2032 x mod(1), f1\u2032 (x) = b\u2032 x, f2\u2032 (x) = b\u2032 x + (1 \u2212 b\u2032 )\n(11)\nwhere a\u2032 = 3/2 + \u03b4, b\u2032 = 1/a\u2032 and \u03b4 = 10\u22123 . Functions f0 ,\nf1 , and f2 are defined as for the map (9) with a = 1/b = 3/2.\nFor such a choice, the Lyapunov exponent of the map in\nEq. (11) is a linear function of p that also changes sign at\np = pc = 1/2 albeit with a different slope. Assuming that a\npartial synchronization transition is also governed by the Lyapunov exponent, we might expect that such a transition, if it\nexists, takes place at p = 1/2.

(5) but xn and x\u2032n evolve according\nto Eq. (10). Numerical calculation of w = limn\u2192\u221e wn for\nN = 108 iterations shows (Fig. 3) that it remains positive\nand smooth around this value. However, there is a more subtle change in the system at or around p = 1/2. Indeed, the\nprobability distribution of P (|x \u2212 x\u2032 |) shows a pronounced\npeak in the p < 1/2 domain (inset of Fig. 3). This is yet\nanother example that shows that partial synchronization manifests through a change in the probability distribution [11].\nHowever, P (|x\u2212x\u2032 |) was calculated for p = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6,\ni.e., values that are relatively far from each other. For smaller\ndifferences between the values of p the corresponding curves\nare getting similar and it is not clear to us whether there is a\nqualitative change in the probability distribution P (|x \u2212 x\u2032 |)\nthat could locate precisely the partial synchronization transition. If not, it could mean that in this case either there is not a\nwell-defined partial synchronization transition, or we are not\nlooking at the right quantity to detect it.\nFor further comparison, we also calculated the probability s\nthat the difference |x\u2212x\u2032 | remains smaller (if initially so) than\na given value \u03b5 = 10\u22124 during the iterations of the system\n(10). One finds that s is a monotonous function of p (Fig. 3).\nCase (B): We choose\n\n(12)\n\nwhere a\u2032 = 3/2, b\u2032 = 2/3 and b\u2032\u2032 = 10\u22123 . Functions f0 ,\nf1 , and f2 are defined as in case (A). For such a choice the\nLyapunov exponents of both systems are the same and they\nchange sign at p = pc = 1/2. The only difference is that the\nfunction f2 (x) has a contracting point at 1, while f2\u2032 (x\u2032 ) at a\nslightly smaller value x\u2032 = 0.997.\nIn this case the synchronization error w behaves similarly\nto case (A) (Fig. 4). However, the probability distribution of\nP (|x\u2212x\u2032 |) has a little bit different shape. In particular, even at\n\nFIG. 4: The synchronization error w and the probability s that |x \u2212\nx\u2032 | < 10\u22124 as a function of p for map (10)-(12).

The maximum at |x \u2212 x\u2032 | =\n0.003 is due to the shift in the location of contracting points. Off the\nsynchronization transition (p = 0.5) the location of the maximum\nchanges.\n\np = 1/2 it has a certain peak which increases with decreasing\np. The maximum of the peak at p = 1/2 is most likely located\nat |x \u2212 x\u2032 | = 0.003 (Fig. 5) and this is related with the difference of the contracting points of the functions f2 (x = 1)\nand f2\u2032 (x\u2032 = 0.997). We checked that off the p = 1/2 point\nthe maximum shifts away from |x \u2212 x\u2032 | = 0.003. Moreover,\nthe probability s that the difference |x \u2212 x\u2032 | is smaller than\n\u03b5 = 10\u22124 shows a maximum at p = 1/2 (Fig. 4).\nComparison of partial synchronization in cases (A) and (B)\nrevealed important differences between them. In case (A),\nwhere we perturbed the Lyapunov exponent, the probability\ndistribution P (|x\u2212x\u2032 |) develops a peak around/at |x\u2212x\u2032 | = 0\nin the partially synchronized state that presumably exists for\np < 1/2.

However, it is not clear to us whether in this\ncase such a change can be characterized more quantitatively\nso that a well-defined transition point exists. A different behaviour takes place in the case (B) with perturbed contracting\npoints. In this case the peak of the probability distribution is\nshifted by a value that at the partial synchronization transition\np = 1/2 (as deduced from the vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent) curiously matches the shift of the contracting points.\nIn addition to that, the probability of being in a state with a\nsmall difference |x \u2212 x\u2032 | has a maximum at p = 1/2 \u2013 in\ndrastic contrast with case (A).\nFor simple maps as those examined in the present paper one\nhas a complete knowledge of the Lyapunov exponents and\nfixed points.

We shall now briefly examine such a situation.\nIn particular we consider two nonidentical systems as those\ndescribed in the case (A) above, with varying difference \u03b4.\nWe calculated the synchronization error w as a function of \u03b4\nfor p = 0.4 and p = 1/2. In both cases we expect that w\nvanishes for \u03b4 \u2192 0. Figure 6 confirms such an expectation,\nbut it also reveals that for p = 1/2 the convergence to zero\nis much slower than for p = 0.4. While for p = 0.4 the synchronization error seems to vanish as w \u223c \u03b4, the inset in Fig. 6\nsuggests that at the synchronization transition the vanishing is\nmost likely logarithmic w \u223c (\u22121/log10 \u03b4).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present paper we examined synchronization of onedimensional random maps. Our results confirm that a complete synchronization transition coincides with the change of\nsign of the Lyapunov exponent. We also showed that the way\nthe partial synchronization manifests depends on the type of\ndifference between the two nonidentical systems. It would\nbe desirable to explain the origin of the logarithmically slow\ncrossover of the partial synchronization to the complete synchronization. It would be also interesting to explain why the\nlocation of the maximum of the probability distribution at the\npartial synchronization transition discussed in case (B) above\nmatches exactly the shift of the contracting points.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by the Swiss National\nScience Foundation and the project OFES 00-0578 \"COSYC\nOF SENS\".
