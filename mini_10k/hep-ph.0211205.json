Introduction\nAn exciting idea to be tested in high-energy collider experiments is the possible existence\nof narrow graviton resonances in the TeV energy range. Such resonances are predicted in\nmodels with small extra spatial dimensions. An example is the localized gravity model of\nRandall and Sundrum (RS) [1]. This model aroused great theoretical interest because it\nmotivates the weak-Planck scale hierarchy via an exponentially suppressed warp factor in a\nnon-factorisable geometry. Many possible extensions and elaborations of this type of theory\nare being discussed in the literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Problems with negative tension\nbrane instability in the original RS model are solved in some other models. For example,\nplacing the branes on fixed points of orbifolds projects out the negative energy modes [11].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fAn extra scalar with couplings on the branes can be used to naturally stabilise the brane\nseparation [12]. Warped extra dimensions (with associated graviton resonances) have also\nbeen considered in the context of supersymmetry [13, 14, 15, 16]. Thus the discovery of\nTeV-scale graviton resonances remains a possibility that needs to be considered seriously\nin preparing for future collider experiments.\nIn [17], the detection of a narrow graviton resonance using the ATLAS detector at the\nLarge Hadron Collider was considered. The main aim of that paper was to establish the\ndiscovery limit in the most favourable decay channel, G \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . A similar study for the\nCMS detector has since been reported [18]. In [17] the angular distribution of the lepton\npair was also studied, and it was shown that the spin-2 nature of the resonance could be\nconfirmed up to a mass somewhat below the discovery limit.\nApart from its unique spin, the most striking characteristic of the graviton is its universal coupling to all types of matter and gauge fields. In the present paper we consider the\naccuracy with which the couplings of a narrow graviton resonance to leptons, electroweak\nbosons, hadronic jets and Higgs bosons could be measured at the LHC. As in [17], we use\nthe expected properties of the ATLAS detector as a guide to experimental limitations and\nthe simplest RS model to characterise the resonance parameters, but our results should\napply to other general-purpose detectors and to a broad class of models. We do, however,\nassume that all matter and gauge fields are confined to the physical brane and do not\npropagate into extra dimensions, thus excluding models of the type considered in [19, 20].\nIn the simple RS scenario, a 5-dimensional non-factorizable geometry is used, with two\n3-branes of opposite tension. A graviton Kaluza-Klein spectrum is created, with a scale\n\u039b\u03c0 = M P l e\u2212krc \u03c0\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere M P l is the reduced effective 4-D Planck scale, rc is the compactification radius of\nthe extra dimension, and k is a scale of the order of the Planck scale. The geometrical\nexponential factor (the 'warp factor') generates TeV scales from fundamental Planck scales\nand hence motivates the weak-Planck hierarchy, if krc \u2248 12.\nThe masses of the graviton resonances are given by\nmn = kxn e\u2212krc \u03c0 = xn (k/M P l )\u039b\u03c0\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere xn are the roots of the Bessel function of order 1 (xn = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735 for\nn = 1, 2, 3). The massive graviton excitations couple with equal strength to the visible\nsector [21]. However, the higher modes being suppressed by the falling parton distribution\nfunctions, only the lightest mode is considered in this paper. This does not in any way\naffect the generality of the approach, as the analysis can be applied to any such resonances,\nincluding the higher modes, so long as the resonances are narrow and sufficiently separated\nfrom the other modes. This is in contrast to studies in which many excitations, each with\nsmall coupling, contribute to some scattering process [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. For brevity, we\nrefer to the first massive resonance, with mass mG = m1 , as \"the graviton\".\nIn the RS model, the couplings of the graviton are given by 1/\u039b\u03c0 . The graviton mass\nis determined by the ratio k/M P l . Our results are presented in the plane of mG , \u039b\u03c0 to\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fallow comparisons to be made with any model in this class. We have also defined a specific\ntest model (identical to that used in [17]), with a value of k/M P l = 0.01 (at the bottom\nof the range suggested in [21]), which according to [20] is on the edge of 95% exclusion\nfor a first graviton excitation mass of less than 2000 GeV. Thus, we assign a low coupling\nconstant to the graviton, and hence obtain a conservative estimate of the production cross\nsection. This choice leads naturally to a narrow resonance. This test scenario is used to\nillustrate the potential physics reach in each decay channel. As already emphasised, the\nresults derived do not depend on the validity of this particular scenario, but can be applied\nto any model giving rise to narrow well-spaced graviton resonances. For example, our\nresults in Section 4 show that in a model with k/M P l = 0.1 (\u039b\u03c0 = 10 TeV), the discovery\nlimit in the e+ e\u2212 channel rises to 3.5 TeV, as a consequence of the increased production\ncross section. Values of k/M P l > 0.1 are disfavoured on theoretical grounds because the\nbulk curvature becomes too large [20].\nAn event generator capable of simulating the production and decay of spin-2 resonances\nhas been developed. This generator is now part of the standard HERWIG [27, 28] simulation\npackage (versions 6.2 and later). The generated events are passed through the ATLAS fast\nsimulation (ATLFAST [29]), in order to give a realistic description of detector resolution\nand efficiency.\nIn the following sections, the event generator is described (section 2), followed by\nstudies of graviton decays to leptons (section 4), photons and massive vector bosons (section\n5), hadronic jets (section 6), and Higgs bosons (section 7). Finally, the ability of the LHC to\ndetermine model parameters, including the length scale of the extra dimension, is discussed.\nHere again we use the simplest RS scenario for illustration.\n\n2. The event generator\nThe implementation of the graviton resonance in the HERWIG event generator has been\ndescribed in [17]. The graviton decays are treated as 2 \u2192 2 processes, consisting of the\ntwo hard production subprocesses q q\u0304 \u2192 G and gg \u2192 G, followed by the graviton decay.\nThe relevant matrix elements were computed from the Feynman rules given in [30, 31].\nInterference with Standard Model background processes is neglected. For the range of\nparameter values considered here, the resonance is so narrow that its observed width is\ndetermined by the detector resolution in all decay channels, and hence interference effects\ncancel in all observable distributions. Note, however, that the neglect of interference is not\na good approximation for the broad resonances considered in [18].\nThe production cross-sections in [17] were calculated using the parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) of Owens [32], set 1.1. The present work uses the more recent MRST [33]\nPDFs. This change has no effect on the conclusions of [17].\nThe resulting graviton production cross section at the LHC for the test model is shown\nas a function of the graviton mass in Figure 1. The dashed curve shows the predictions for\nthe 'central gluon' and 'high gluon' leading-order PDFs of [33]; the solid curve is for the\naverage of these, which is the default PDF set for HERWIG version 6.3 [34]. This has been\nfound to give the best agreement with recent next-to-leading order fits [35]. The dashed\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fCross Section (pb)\n\ncurves give an indication of the uncertainty due to reasonable variation of the gluon PDF.\nWe see that, even with our conservative choice of the coupling, for a graviton mass of 1.5\nTeV the expected number of produced gravitons is about 5000 for an integrated luminosity\nof 100 fb\u22121 , falling to about 70 at a mass of 3 TeV.\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nGraviton Mass (TeV)\n\nFigure 1: Cross section for graviton production at LHC.\n\nThe dot-dashed curve in Figure 1 shows the gluon fusion contribution to the cross\nsection for the default PDF set; this is shown as a fraction of the total production cross\nsection in Figure 2. Gluon fusion dominates the cross section for graviton masses up to 3.4\nTeV. This has important implications for the angular distribution of the graviton decay\n(see below).\nThe branching fractions of the graviton into various decay modes are shown in Figure 3.\nThese predictions are rather model-independent, depending only on the universality of the\ncoupling. We see that decays into quark and gluon jets will predominate, due to their\nhigh multiplicity of colour, spin and flavour states. The Higgs boson fraction depends\nsignificantly on the assumed Higgs mass when mG < 10mH ; we have used mH = 115 GeV,\nthe default HERWIG value. Out of 5000 produced gravitons with mass 1.5 TeV, we expect\nroughly 3500 jet-jet, 100 e+ e\u2212 , 100 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , 100 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , 300 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304, 200 \u03b3\u03b3, 450 W + W \u2212 , 225\nZ 0 Z 0 and 15 H 0 H 0 decays.\nThe angular distributions of the various decay modes in the graviton rest frame are\nsummarized in Table 1.

In Table 1, the plot letters refer to Figure 4,\nwhich shows the distributions in the limit of negligible mass (\u03b2 = 1). Note that the angular distribution depends strongly on the production mechanism. As we saw above, gluon\nfusion predominates, but the contribution of quark-antiquark fusion has a structure that\ntends to flatten the decay angular distribution. Notice that the angular distributions of\nthe massive gauge bosons W and Z are slightly different from those of the massless \u03b3 and\ngluon, even in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 1, owing to their extra longitudinal polarization state, which\nhas the same distribution as the Higgs boson.\n\n3. Measurements of the graviton couplings\nIn [17] it was shown that the graviton resonance can be detected up to a mass of 2080 GeV\nin our test model, using the process pp \u2192 G \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . The limits are model independent\nas long as the graviton couplings are universal and give rise to narrow resonances, with\nwidths less than the experimental resolution. The angular distribution of the lepton pair\ncan be used to determine the spin of the intermediate state. In our test model, the angular\ndistribution favours a spin-2 hypothesis over a spin-1 hypothesis at 90% confidence for\ngraviton masses up to 1720 GeV. In this work, we consider the full range of parameter\nspace. In some cases, the search reach can be much higher than in the test model.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fBranching Fraction (%)\n\n10\n\n2\n\ng\n\nW\nu\n\n10\nZ\n\n\u03b3\ne\n\nt\n\n1\nH\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nGraviton Mass (TeV)\n\nFigure 3: Graviton branching fractions.\n\nProcess\n\nDistribution\n\nPlot\n\ngg \u2192 G \u2192 f f \u0304\nq q\u0304 \u2192 G \u2192 f f \u0304\n\nsin2 \u03b8 \u2217 (2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2217 )\n\na\n\n1\n\n+ cos2 \u03b8 \u2217\n\n1 + 6 cos2 \u03b8 \u2217 + cos4 \u03b8 \u2217\n\ngg \u2192 G \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, gg\nq q\u0304 \u2192 G \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, gg\n\ngg \u2192 G \u2192 W W, ZZ\nq q\u0304 \u2192 G \u2192 W W, ZZ\ngg \u2192 G \u2192 HH\nq q\u0304 \u2192 G \u2192 HH\n\n\u2212\n\n4\u03b2 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2217 cos2 \u03b8 \u2217\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\u2212\n\ncos4 \u03b8 \u2217\n\n3 4\n4 \u2217\n16 \u03b2 sin \u03b8\ncos2 \u03b8 \u2217 ) + 32 \u03b2 4 sin2 \u03b8 \u2217 cos2 \u03b8 \u2217\nsin4 \u03b8 \u2217\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2217 +\n\n\u03b2 2 (1\n\n+\n\nsin2 \u03b8 \u2217 cos2 \u03b8 \u2217\n\nb\nc\na\nd\ne\nf\ng\n\nTable 1: Angular distributions in graviton production and decay. \u03b8\u2217 is the polar angle of the\noutgoing fermion in the graviton rest frame.

Graviton decays to leptons\n4.1 G \u2192 e+ e\u2212\nThis channel offers the best chance of discovery of a graviton resonance at the LHC,\nby virtue of the relatively small background from Drell-Yan processes, and the excellent\nmass resolution provided by the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter. More details of the\nproposed discovery search can be found in [17].\nMeasurements of the graviton coupling were studied by simulating signals at graviton\nmasses between 0.5 and 4.0 TeV. These signals were superimposed on the expected background from Drell-Yan. Electrons were selected with pT > 5 GeV inside the acceptance\nof the ATLAS tracking detector (|\u03b7| < 2.5), using the standard electron reconstruction\nalgorithm of ATLFAST, which accounts for the effect of nearby particles on the calorimeter\nsignature. The pair with the highest pT were used to construct the graviton mass. The\nmass distribution of the electron pair is well fitted by a Gaussian signal on a background\nof the form \u03b1m\u2212\u03b2\nee , where mee is the mass of the electron pair, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are free parameters. The acceptance of the detector varies from 91 to 76% across the mass range, with\nan estimated systematic error of < 1%, and a negligible statistical error. The efficiency\nfor detecting an isolated electron is taken as 90%. The systematic error on this value will\ndepend on the details of the detector and reconstruction code used, and is hence beyond\nthe scope of this study. However, we note that, for the very high energy electrons involved\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fEvents\n\nin these decays, it will not be necessary to make tight cuts on the electron tracks, and so a\nhigh efficiency with a small error should be obtained. The fit for a graviton mass of 1500\nGeV is shown in Figure 5.\n\n20\n18\n\nSignal\nSM\n\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1450\n\n1500\n1550\nElectron pair mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 5: The number of events per 4 GeV mass bin from a graviton resonance, with mG = 1.5\nTeV (signal), superimposed on the expected Standard Model background (SM), for 100 fb\u22121 of\nintegrated luminosity. The fit to the data is shown by the dotted curve.\n\nIn order to estimate the precision which could be expected for the measurement of\nthe production cross-section times branching ratio \u03c3.B, a procedure for subtracting the\nbackground under the peak is required. To avoid assumptions about the background shape,\nwe use a simple background subtraction procedure. The background estimate NBest is\nobtained by counting the number of events in two bins of width w/2 on either side of the\nsignal. This procedure will work well since the mass window used to select the signal,\nof width w, is narrow. It contains N events, made up of NS signal and NB background\nevents. The error on the signal estimate NSest is then given by\nq\n\u2206NSest = \u2206N 2 + \u2206NBest 2 .\n(4.1)\nThe fractional error on \u03c3.B is then simply equal to \u2206NSest /NSest\nIn a real experiment, it would be possible to use a more sophisticated procedure to\nobtain NBest , by fitting over a larger range of electron pair mass. This means that our\nestimates of the experimental reach are conservative. But since, in the interesting regions,\nthe background levels are small, the effect of background subtraction on the final error is\nalso small.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fA systematic error arises from the errors on the acceptance, electron identification\nefficiency and luminosity. The method for luminosity measurement in ATLAS is not yet\ndecided, but an error of 5-10% is within reach of conventional methods [36]. Methods to\nimprove this to 1-2% are under consideration. Together with the as yet unknown electron\nreconstruction efficiency (see above) this means that the systematic error on cross-section\nmeasurements is very uncertain at present, and hence we plot our results using statistical\nerrors only. The effect of the systematic error on the extraction of model parameters is\ndiscussed in section 9.\nThe above procedure was used to determine how well the ATLAS detector could measure the graviton coupling. The HERWIG/ATLFAST simulation was run at each graviton\nmass, and for the standard model background, for 100 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, corresponding to one year of running of the LHC at its nominal luminosity of 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nThe estimated statistical errors on \u03c3.B are plotted on Figure 6. Also shown are the region excluded by Tevatron data [37, 38] and lines of constant k/M P l . In the test model,\nwith k/M P l = 0.01, a 10% measurement of the production rate is possible for graviton\nresonance masses as high as 1400 GeV. In models with k/M P l = 0.1 (\u039b\u03c0 = 10 TeV),\na 20% measurement of the coupling is possible for graviton masses as high as 3.5 TeV,\nindicating the ultimate search reach. For completeness, we have continued the contours\ninto the region of very small k/M P l . This region is excluded in the RS\u2013I model [20], but\nmay be relevant to other models with low mass graviton resonances. In such a case, values\nof \u039b\u03c0 as high as 100 TeV are in principle accessible. For high values of k/M P l > 0.05,\nhorizontally-striped on the plot, the graviton resonance width becomes larger than the\nexperimental mass resolution, making a measurement of the width possible. It is unlikely\nthat such a measurement would be possible in any of the other channels considered here,\nsince their mass resolutions are far inferior. Once the width becomes very large, it would\nbe necessary to increase the size of the mass window in order to maintain a high efficiency\nfor the signal. Interference with the Drell-Yan background would also need to be taken\ninto account. However, the production cross-section is proportional to (k/M P l )2 , and so\nthe detection of the resonance is trivial in this region.\n4.2 G \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nThe analysis of this channel is very similar to that for the electron case. Muons were selected\nwith pT > 5 GeV using the standard muon reconstruction algorithm of ATLFAST. The pair\nwith the highest pT were used to construct the graviton mass. The discovery potential in\nthe \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel is not as great as in the e+ e\u2212 case, because the momentum resolution\nof the magnetic spectrometer decreases at high muon momentum. This is reflected in a\nmuch poorer mass resolution for high muon pair masses. In addition, the reconstruction\nefficiency is poorer than for electrons. Nonetheless, precisions of \u03c3.B < 10% are achievable\nin the test model case, for graviton resonance masses up to 1250 GeV. Figure 7 shows the\nresults, which can provide a valuable check of lepton universality in the graviton couplings.\n4.3 G \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\n\nThe \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode would be extremely hard to observe on the large standard model\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f\u039b \u03c0 (TeV)\n\nk =0.01\nM Pl\n\n100\n90\n\nG \u2192 e +e -\n\n\u2206 (\u03c3 .B)\n\u03c3 .B\n\n80\n\n20%\n\n70\n\n10%\n\n60\n\n5%\n\n50\n1%\n40\n\nk =0.02\nM Pl\nk =0.03\nM Pl\n\n30\n\nk =0.05\nM Pl\n\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n3500\n4000\nGraviton Mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 6: Contours showing the statistical precision expected for a measurement of \u03c3.B in the\ndecay mode G \u2192 e+ e\u2212 for 100 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity (Solid lines with markers). Also shown\nare lines of equal k/M P l (dashed). The test model has k/M P l = 0.01. The (red) blocked region\nnear the origin is excluded by Tevatron data [37, 38].

The (blue)\nblocked region with k/M P l > 0.1 is disfavoured theoretically.\n\nbackground from QCD jets. The missing energy from the \u03c4 decays would spoil the mass\nresolution for the graviton signal, further degrading the significance of any peak. This\nsignal is therefore not considered further.\n\n5. Decays to vector bosons\nThe detection of decays to vector bosons would be very important in establishing the\nnature of a graviton resonance, since the universal coupling would be very different from\nthat expected for other exotic objects, such as a Z \u2032 . In addition the angular distribution\nof the decay products is a characteristic signature of the resonance spin (see Table 1 and\nFigure 4).\n5.1 G \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nThe method used to study this channel is identical to that used for the electron case.

The HERWIG calculation of the\ncross-section only includes the Born term and production from gluon-gluon interactions\nvia a quark box diagram. It is known that these diagrams alone predict a cross-section\nfor photon pair production at the Tevatron which is a factor of \u2248 5 too small [39]. This\nlarge discrepancy means that one cannot rely on existing Monte Carlo simulations to produce a reliable background estimate, and in particular that the angular distribution of the\nbackground cannot be trusted. We note that these effects were not considered in [40].\nAs discussed in Section 2, graviton production at accessible masses is dominated by\ngluon-gluon fusion, and therefore the photon angular distribution is strongly forwardbackward peaked, as shown by curve c in Figure 4. An important background, not presently\nsimulated by HERWIG (or any other current event generator), is bremsstrahlung from initial state partons, which is also strongly forward-backward peaked. For these reasons, we\ndo not attempt an analysis of how well the resonance spin could be determined at the LHC.\nHowever, it should be noted that the background level and angular distribution can easily\nbe measured in the experiment by using data away from the resonance itself. The photon\nchannel will then be very significant in establishing the nature of the resonance.\nFor this analysis, we use a photon pair background 5 times as large as predicted by\nHERWIG in order to estimate the precision which could be reached on the coupling in this\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f\u039b \u03c0 (TeV)\n\nchannel.

This mode has a\nreasonable branching fraction (29% of W pairs), and the reconstruction of the events can\nbe performed by assuming that the missing energy is due only to the neutrino from the\nleptonic decay and using the W mass as a constraint.\nThis channel has considerable difficulties compared to the leptonic and \u03b3\u03b3 channels\ndue to the large background from tt\u0304 and W +2 jets. Consequently this channel would not\nbe a discovery channel, but would be useful in confirming the universality of the graviton's\ncoupling. Scale factors for the background were obtained by comparing the HERWIG crosssection with the NLL cross-section for tt\u0304 [41] and by using the prescription in [42] for W +2\njets, giving scale factors of 1.8 and 1.7 respectively. Background from W W production was\nalso included for completeness but was negligible compared to the other backgrounds.\nStandard ATLFAST settings for high luminosity were used except for the jet reconstruction algorithm, for which the Mulguisin algorithm [43] with a minimum distance of\n\u2206R = 0.2 was used. This algorithm was chosen because it was found to give the highest\nsignal reconstruction efficiency.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fJet reconstruction is problematic because the jets come from a W which is highly\nboosted. This naturally leads to two jets very close in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6: for a 3 TeV graviton, both\njets often fall within the same calorimeter cell as defined by ATLFAST.\nThe neutrino 4-momentum is reconstructed from E\n/ T and fixing the mass of the l\u03bd\nsystem to be the mass of a W . This gives a quadratic equation which is solved and the\naverage of the two solutions taken. The second W is reconstructed from the highest pT\njet and a jet which gives 65 < Mjj < 85 GeV. If more than one possibility is found, the\ncombination that gives the highest pT (W ) is chosen.\nThe pT cuts are set fairly low to allow the whole range of graviton masses above 500\nGeV to be treated in a single analysis. Some improvement could be made by tuning these\ncuts for a smaller mass region, using the mass of the resonance as measured in the e+ e\u2212\nchannel as a guide.\nTo reduce the tt background the following cuts were imposed: a top reconstruction\nveto which attempts to reconstruct a top mass from each of the W s and an acceptably\nclose jet (within \u2206R < 1), and a cut on the number of central (|\u03b7| < 2) jets.\nThe signal reconstruction efficiency is 22% at 1.5 TeV, dropping to 6% at 3 TeV.\nThe mass resolution is 6%. The background is not well described by any simple form\nover the entire range, but it is very smooth. Therefore it is expected that background\nsubtraction will be successfully achieved by fitting a function in the sidebands. The error\non the background estimate was found by fitting an exponential with a window of m \u00b1 2\u03c3\nin a fit region m \u00b1 6\u03c3. Figure 9 shows the background subtraction procedure, in the case\nk/M P l = 0.05.\nThe error on the signal estimate, NSest is given by equation (4.1), taking the error on\nNBest to be the statistical error on the number of events in the fit region. The estimated\nstatistical errors for \u03c3.B were then calculated in the same way as the other channels and\nare shown in Figure 10.\nIn the test model with k/M P l = 0.01, a measurement of \u03c3.B is not possible. However,\nfor higher values of k/M P l , measurement is possible with statistical accuracies in the range\n5-30%. For high masses, the overlap of jets means that the efficiency of the selection cuts\nbecomes very low. A different analysis would be required, perhaps based on event shapes\nin order to extend the reach further. At low masses, the effects of the pT cuts on the\ndetermination of the fit parameters can be seen.\n5.3 G \u2192 ZZ \u2192 lljj\nThis channel is analyzed in much the same way as the W W channel. The principal difference is that the dominant background is Z+2 jets \u2013 there is no tt\u0304 equivalent. Consequently,\nsimilar reconstruction and cuts were employed with the omission of the cuts intended to\nreduce the tt\u0304 background.\nThe same background fitting and subtraction procedure as in the W W case is followed\nleading to a similar error determination, the results of which are shown in Figure 11.\nSignal reconstruction efficiency is similar to the W W case and mass resolution is better,\n\u223c 3%.

As before, the effect of decreasing efficiency at\nhigh mass is evident as is the effect of the pT cuts at lower masses.\n\n6. Decays to hadronic final states\n6.1 Inclusive decays to 2 jets\nThe signature for the decay mode G \u2192 jj comprises two energetic jets in the detector,\nproducing a large transverse hadronic energy. The dominant background process to this\ntopology is QCD multi-jet production, which forms a continuum irreducible background.\nThis large background would make it impossible to find a statistically significant signal\npeak without the knowledge of the peak position provided by other channels such as the\ne+ e\u2212 final state, except in cases with very large graviton couplings. However, as stated\nabove, we assume that any discovery will be made in other channels, and investigate the\npotential to measure the coupling strength alone in hadronic channels.\nG \u2192 jj candidates are selected by requiring at least two jets with minimum transverse\nenergies (ET ) of a quarter of the graviton mass. The continuum background is shown in\nFigure 12a, with a resonance at 1500 GeV superimposed, using k/M P l = 0.08. The signal is\nnot visible to the eye.

NS and NB are the\nnumber of G \u2192 jj signal and background events after the selection cuts.\nThe mass of the graviton is determined from the invariant mass of the two highest ET\njets; if a third jet is in close proximity (\u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03c6 < 1) to one of these two high ET jets, the\nmass of the graviton is calculated from the invariant mass of the three highest ET jets. The\nmass resolution for this decay mode degrades dramatically with a long tail toward lower\nmasses (e.g., the mass resolution is about 160 GeV for a 2000 GeV graviton).\nTo extract the signal, a procedure independent of the signal shape has been adopted.\nThe mass distribution of the jets is fitted by a Gaussian signal (whose peak is fixed to\nbe at the previously determined peak of the signal) on a background of exponential form.\nThe procedure for subtracting the background under the peak is the same as that for\nthe G \u2192 W W channel. Figure 12b shows the signal after background subtraction. The\nvery high statistics in the background sidebands allow the background under the signal\nto be estimated with very high precision, revealing the signal peak.

However, since both the graviton and gluon couplings to quarks are flavour independent, no extra discrimination is obtained. The best experimental strategy is therefore\nto exploit the higher statistical power of the inclusive dijet channel.\n\n7. Decays to Higgs pairs\nIn the case that mG > 2mH then the channel G \u2192 HH is open. The angular distribution\nis given in Table 1. The branching ratio is 1/12 of that into di-photons, if mG \u226b 2mH .\nThe dominant final state will be 4 b-quarks (for a light Higgs boson) or 4 W 's (for a heavy\nHiggs boson). Both of these final states are difficult to reconstruct, and will have poor\nstatistics. The Higgs coupling is therefore unlikely to be measurable at the LHC.\n\n8. Summary of the reach for coupling measurements\nThe results of the simulations of each graviton decay channel are summarised in Table\n2. The precision which can be reached on \u03c3.B in each of the channels investigated, is\npresented for a range of points in the mG , \u039b\u03c0 plane.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\f3\n\nEvents (\u00d7 10 )\n\n5\n\nEvents (\u00d7 10 )\n\n10\n\n14\n\nSignal + SM\n12\n\nSignal\n\n8\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n\n8\n\n2\n\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n\n-2\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nJets mass (GeV)\n\n1800\n\nJets mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 12: Distribution of invariant mass a) for all two jet events selected, and b) after background\nsubtraction.\n\nPoint mG , \u039b\u03c0 (TeV)\nChannel\n\n1,10\n\n1,20\n\n1,30\n\n2,10\n\n2,20\n\n2,30\n\n3,10\n\n3,20\n\ne+ e\u2212\n\n1.6\n\n3.3\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n11.0\n\n17.1\n\n15.1\n\n30.7\n\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\n1.9\n\n4.5\n\n8.2\n\n6.2\n\n15.2\n\n28.2\n\n15.1\n\n32.7\n\n\u03b3\u03b3\n\n1.2\n\n2.9\n\n5.2\n\n3.9\n\n8.8\n\n15.2\n\n10.5\n\n23.0\n\nWW\n\n11.6\n\n44.9\n\n-\n\n38.2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nZZ\n\n13.7\n\n50.1\n\n-\n\n52.7\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\njj\n\n19.0\n\n77.0\n\n-\n\n31.0\n\n-\n\n-\n\n59.0\n\n-\n\nTable 2: The relative precision achievable (in %) for measurements of \u03c3.B in each of the channels\nconsidered, for fixed points in the mG , \u039b\u03c0 plane. Points with errors above 100% are not shown.\n\n9. Determination of the model parameters\nSeveral models have been built [9, 10] in which our analysis applies. They are based on the\noriginal RS model but with additional branes. Supersymmetric versions [14, 15] have also\nbeen constructed, in which the graviton resonances are identical to the ones studied here.\nThese models all have a narrow relatively strongly coupled first massive graviton mode,\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\f\u039b \u03c0 (TeV)\n\n20\n18\n\nk =0.01\nM Pl\n\nk =0.02\nM Pl\n\nk =0.03\nM Pl\n\nG \u2192 jet jet\n\nk =0.04\nM Pl\n\n\u2206( \u03c3 .B)\n\u03c3.B\n\n16\n\n30%\n\n14\n\n20%\n\n12\n\n10%\n\n10\n\n5%\n\n8\n\nk =0.05\nM Pl\n\nk =0.07\nM Pl\nk =0.1\nM Pl\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n3000\nGraviton Mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 13: The fractional error on \u03c3.B versus \u039b\u03c0 and graviton mass in G \u2192 jj decay mode for\n100 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, as for Figure 6.\n\nand our analysis should apply to them (as long as the parameters are such that the graviton\nis narrower than the experimental resolution). This is because graviton modes couple to\nmatter in proportionality to the energy-momentum tensor as a model-independent feature,\nguaranteeing the universality of the coupling. The overall coupling strength is a model\ndependent parameter, as of course is the connection between the model parameters and\nthe mass or coupling of the first graviton mode. We note that even in the factorisable extra\ndimension case [22, 23], the resonances would be well separated if the extra dimension were\nsmall enough. The splitting between the resonances in the factorisable case is constant,\nbeing 2\u03c0/R where R measures the size of the extra dimension(s) [30]. If 1/R were in\nthe range MZ \u2212 1 TeV, resonance graviton production would still not be possible because\neach state couples with negligible strength, suppressed by the Planck mass. But if models\nwere constructed which increase this coupling in the factorisable dimension scenario, our\nanalysis would be fully applicable to this case also.\nAs a specific example, we have considered the precision which could be obtained on the\nparameters of the RS model, in the case mG = 1500 GeV. Since the model only contains\ntwo parameters (mG and \u039b\u03c0 = 39 TeV), only two measurements are required to fully\nconstrain the model. mG can be measured directly in the e+ e\u2212 channel, with a statistical\nprecision of better than 1 GeV (our fit gives 0.7 GeV for mG = 1500 GeV). The energy\nscale error is given in [36] as < 0.7% in this energy range, giving a resolution on mG of\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\f10.5 GeV. The statistical error on the coupling depends on \u039b\u03c0 , ranging from 1% at low\n\u039b\u03c0 to 15% for \u039b\u03c0 =39 TeV as in the test model. The dominant systematic error on the\ncoupling is due to the luminosity measurement, since the systematic errors on efficiencies\nand acceptances will be below the 1% level. We assume, conservatively, that the luminosity\ncan be obtained to 10%, giving an overall error on \u03c3.B of 18%. We can then infer a value\nfor the compactification radius of the extra dimension, rc , and its error, using equations\n(1.1) and (1.2). The precision on the coupling measurement is then directly reflected in the\nerror in rc giving rc = (82 \u00b1 7) \u00d7 10\u221233 m. This reach to extremely small distance scales\nis a consequence of the warp factor in the model, working on the TeV-scale measurements\nof physical observables.\n\n10. Conclusions\nThe LHC detectors will be capable of discovering narrow graviton resonances predicted in a\nrange of models with extra space dimensions. Such resonances will most easily be detected\nin the di-electron and di-photon final states. The coupling strength of the resonance to\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , W + W \u2212 , Z 0 Z 0 and jet\u2013jet final states (but not \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 or H 0 H 0 ) can also be measured\nover a wide range of parameter space. The resonance spin can also be measured over a\nmore limited mass range. Taken together, these measurements would provide compelling\nevidence for the existence of a massive graviton resonance coupling to the SM fields with\na universal coupling strength.\nSince models with a small number of Planck-scale extra dimensions are highly constrained, the model parameters can be extracted with good precision, if a particular scenario is assumed. In the RS test model, the size of the extra dimension can be inferred to\nbetter than 10%, corresponding to a precision in length of 7\u00d710\u221233 m, using measurements\nof \u03c3.B and the graviton mass.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank I.
