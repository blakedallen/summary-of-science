Introduction\nIn my view, the two most important problems in the area of chaos (turbulence) are\n1. An effective description of chaotic (turbulent) solutions beyond the\nReynolds average, so that important characteristics of the chaotic\n(turbulent) solutions can be revealed accurately.\n2. Proofs of the existence of chaos (turbulence), so that the parameter\nregime and certain characteristics of chaos (turbulence) can be\ndiscovered. Control of chaos (turbulence) is a sub-problem here.\nSo far, there is no substantial progress on problem 1 [30]. There are\nimportant progresses on problem 2 [31] which will be addressed later. A\nnotable mathematical problem on Navier-Stokes equations is the global\nregularity problem which was chosen as one of the seven Clay problems.\nExtensive studies have been conducted on chaos in ordinary differential equations (ODE) [1], and intensive studies are focused upon\n\u2217 Department of Mathematics, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO65211, USA.\nE-mail: cli@math.missouri.edu\n\n\f2\n\nY. Charles Li\n\nLorenz equations [34]. Existence of chaos in Lorenz equations has not\nbeen proved by hand. Recently, there have been a new trend of computer proofs [36]. In general, for near integrable ODE with transversal\nhomoclinics, existence of chaos can often be proved by hand. The same\nis true for PDE.\nChaos in partial differential equations (PDE) has long been an open\narea. During the last decade, a standard program was established for\nproving the existence of chaos in near integrable PDE [25]. Around\ntransversal homoclinics, existence of chaos can be proved by hand [20]\n[21] [22], while around non-transversal homoclinics, existence of chaos\ncan be proved by hand up to nasty generic conditions [23] [24]. There\nare also attempts of computer proofs on the existence of chaos in PDE.\nIn contrast to ODE, PDE has a lot of novelties. For instance,\nboundary condition plays a major role on dynamics. So far, all the\nchaos in PDE is proved under periodic boundary condition. In fact, odd\nor even constraint besides the periodic boundary condition is crucial.\nOften one can prove the existence of chaos under odd or even constraint,\nbut not in general. Periodic boundary condition permits a representation of solutions by Fourier series. The sequence of Fourier modes in the\nFourier series leads to a natural generalization of ODE to infinite dimensional systems. The Fourier series also makes hand calculation possible.\nUnder other boundary conditions, hand calculation is often impossible.\nMore importantly, the dynamics is dramatically different. For example,\nfor the whole space problem (i.e. under decaying boundary conditions),\nexistence of chaos has not been proved. Of course, the PDE type is fundamental to dynamics. So far, the chaos proved is for mixed hyperbolic\nand parabolic semilinear systems which are near hyperbolic semilinear\nintegrable systems. For semilinear systems, existence of invariant manifolds is easy to obtain. For hyperbolic quasilinear systems, existence\nof invariant manifolds is a big open problem. Here one of the interesting examples will be Euler equations. Even for the simple integrable\nderivative nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (DNLS)\niqt = qxx \u2212 i |q|2 q\n\n\u0001\n\nx\n\n,\n\n(1.1)\n\nexistence of invariant manifolds is open while its invariant subspaces\nare perfectly normal [32]. This difficulty is the major obstacle toward\nproving the existence of chaos when the DNLS is under perturbations.\nChaos in PDE is a rich area, full of potential, with a crown goal\nof solving the problem of turbulence. Turbulence is governed by NavierStokes equations (NS). Turbulence often happens when the Reynolds\nnumber is large. Formally setting the Reynolds number to infinity in the\nNavier-Stokes equations, one gets the Euler equations. Euler equations\nare a lot like hyperbolic quasilinear integrable systems [15] [17] [18].\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n3\n\nBy posing periodic boundary condition to Navier-Stokes equations, one\ncan study turbulence in the near Euler equations regime as a canonical\nproblem. So far, there is no success in proving the existence of chaos in\nNavier-Stokes equations.\n\n2. Chaos in Partial Differential Equations\nThe standard program that we developed for proving the existence of\nchaos in partial differential equations [25] involves multi-disciplinary subjects including integrable theory, dynamical system, partial differential\nequation, and functional analysis. The specific machineries are: (1).\nDarboux transformations, (2). Isospectral theory, (3). Persistence of invariant manifolds and Fenichel fibers, (4). Melnikov analysis and shooting technique, (5). Shadowing technique and symbolic dynamics, (6).\nSpecific Smale horseshoe construction.\n\n21.\n\nTransversal Homoclinics and Heteroclinics\n\nIn a non-autonomous system (e.g. a periodic system), transversality can\noften be signified by its Poincar\u00e9 period map. A typical example in this\ncase for a success of proving the existence of chaos is the sine-Gordon\nsystem [22] [28]:\nutt = c2 uxx + sin u + \u01eb[\u2212au + f sin3 u]\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich is subject to periodic boundary condition and even (or odd) constraint\nu(t, x + 2\u03c0) = u(t, x), u(t, \u2212x) = u(t, x), or u(t, \u2212x) = \u2212u(t, x), (2.3)\nwhere u is a real-valued function of two real variables t and x, c and\na > 0 are parameters, 21 < c < 1, \u01eb is a small perturbation parameter,\n\u01eb \u2265 0, and f = cos t for example.\nTheorem 1. [22] [28] For (\u01eb, a) \u2208 (0, \u01eb0 ] \u00d7 (a1 , a2 ), where \u01eb0 > 0\nand 0 < a1 < a2 , under the odd constraint (2.3), there is a homoclinic\norbit; under the even constraint (2.3), there is a heteroclinic cycle. In a\nneighborhood of the homoclinic orbit or heteroclinic cycle, there is chaos.\nThat is, there is a Cantor set \u039e of points, which is invariant under an\niteration of the Poincar\u00e9 period map F K for some K. The action of F K\non \u039e is topologically conjugate to the action of the Bernoulli shift on two\nsymbols 0 and 1.\nThe proof on the existence of a homoclinic orbit or a heteroclinic\ncycle involves Darboux transformations, isospectral theory, persistence\nof invariant manifolds and Fenichel fibers, and Melnikov analysis and\n\n\f4\n\nY. Charles Li\n\nshooting technique. The proof on the existence of chaos involves shadowing technique and symbolic dynamics.\nThe concept of a homoclinic orbit or a heteroclinic cycle can be\ngeneralized to a homoclinic tube or a heteroclinically tubular cycle [22]\n[28] by replacing orbits with invariant tubes. It turns out that the above\ntheorem is still true for tubes. On the other hand, dynamics inside the\ntubes can be chaotic too. So we have a smaller scale chaos embedded\ninside a larger scale chaos. In principle, this process can continue to\nsmaller and smaller scale chaos. Thus we can have a \"chaos cascade\"\n[22] [28]. For example, let f = f (t, \u03b8) in (2.2) where f (t, \u03b8) is periodic\nin t and \u03b8 \u2208 TN . For example, \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 ), \u03b8n = \u03c9n t + \u03b8n0 + \u01eb\u03bc \u03b8n ,\n\u03bc > 1, and \u03b8n 's are given by the ABC flow [5],\n\u03b8\u03071 = A sin \u03b83 + C cos \u03b82 ,\n\u03b8\u03072 = B sin \u03b81 + A cos \u03b83 ,\n\u03b8\u03073 = C sin \u03b82 + B cos \u03b81 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhich is chaotic for certain values of the real parameters A, B, and C.\nLet \u03b84 = \u03c94 t + \u03b840 , f can be, for example, of the form\nf (t, \u03b8) = \u03b1 +\n\n4\nX\n\n\u03b2n cos \u03b8n ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03c9n 's (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4) form a quasiperiodic basis, \u03b8n0 's (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4) are\nconstant phases, and \u03b1 and \u03b2n are real constants.\nTheorem 2. [22] [28] For (\u01eb, a) \u2208 (0, \u01eb0 ] \u00d7 (a1 , a2 ), where \u01eb0 > 0\nand 0 < a1 < a2 , under the odd constraint (2.3), there is a homoclinic\ntube; under the even constraint (2.3), there is a heteroclinically tubular\ncycle. In a neighborhood of the homoclinic tube or heteroclinically tubular\ncycle, there is tubular chaos. That is, there is a Cantor set \u039e of tori,\nwhich is invariant under an iteration of the Poincar\u00e9 period map F K for\nsome K. The action of F K on \u039e is topologically conjugate to the action\nof the Bernoulli shift on two symbols 0 and 1.\nIn an autonomous system, a transversal homoclinic orbit or a heteroclinic cycle is asymptotic to a limit cycle. A typical example in this case\nfor a success of proving the existence of chaos is the Ginzburg-Landau\nequation in the near nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger regime:\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n9\n2\n2\n2\n\u02c6\n(2.6)\n\u2212 |q| q + \u03bc|\u2202x q| q\u0304 ,\niqt = qxx + 2|q| q + i\u01eb\n16\nwhere q is a complex-valued function of two real variables t and x, \u01eb \u2265 0\nis the perturbation parameter, \u03bc is a real constant, and \u2202\u02c6x is a bounded\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n5\n\nFourier multiplier,\n\u2202\u02c6x q = \u2212\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\nk q\u0303k sin kx ,\n\nfor q =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nq\u0303k cos kx ,\n\nk=0\n\nfor some fixed large K. Periodic boundary condition and even constraint\nare imposed,\nq(t, x + 2\u03c0) = q(t, x) , q(t, \u2212x) = q(t, x) .\nTheorem 3. [20] There exists a \u01eb0 > 0, such that for any \u01eb \u2208\n(0, \u01eb0 ), and |\u03bc| > 5.8, there exist two transversal homoclinic orbits asymptotic to the limit cycle qc = 43 exp{\u2212i[ 89 t + \u03b3]}. In a neighborhood of the\nhomoclinic orbits there is chaos, in the sense of Theorem 1 with the\nPoincar\u00e9 period map replaced by a Poincar\u00e9 return map.\nThe proof on the existence of the two transversal homoclinic orbits\nuses the same tools as above. The proof on the existence of chaos uses a\nshadowing lemma developed in [20] for infinite dimensional autonomous\nsystems - a long time open problem.\n\n22.\n\nNon-Transversal Homoclinics and Heteroclinics\n\nIn an autonomous system, homoclinics or heteroclinics asymptotic to a\nsaddle is usually non-transversal. Some of such homoclinics or heteroclinics can still induce chaos, e.g. Silnikov homoclinics. Nevertheless, a\nproof without any generic assumption on such chaos is still elusive. A\ntypical example is the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the near nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger regime [23]:\niqt = qxx + 2[|q|2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ]q + i\u01eb[qxx \u2212 \u03b1q + \u03b2] ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere q = q(t, x) is a complex-valued function of the two real variables\nt and x, \u03c9 \u2208 (1/2, 1), \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 are constants, and \u01eb \u2265 0\nis the perturbation parameter. Periodic boundary condition and even\nconstraint are imposed,\nq(t, x + 2\u03c0) = q(t, x) , q(t, \u2212x) = q(t, x) .\nTheorem 4. [23] [24] There exists a \u01eb0 > 0, such that for any\n\u01eb \u2208 (0, \u01eb0 ), there exists a codimension 1 surface in the space of (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c9) \u2208\nR+ \u00d7 R+ \u00d7 R+ where \u03c9 \u2208 ( 21 , 1)/S, S is a finite subset, and \u03b1\u03c9 < \u03b2. For\nany (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c9) on the codimension-one surface, the Ginzburg-Landau equation (2.7) has a pair of Silnikov homoclinic orbits asymptotic to a saddle.\nThe codimension 1 surface has the approximate expression \u03b1 = 1/\u03ba(\u03c9)\nwhere \u03ba(\u03c9) is given in Figure 1. Under certain generic assumptions,\nSmale horseshoes can be constructed in the neighborhood of the homoclinic orbits. That is, there exists chaos under generic assumptions.\n\n\f6\n\nY. Charles Li\n\nFigure 1: The graph of \u03ba = \u03ba(\u03c9).\n\n23.\n\nExtra Comments\n\nOther success or partial success in proving the existence of chaos includes the discrete Ginzburg-Landau equation in the near discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger regime [10] [11] [12] [19], perturbed Davey-Stewartson\nequation [14] [27], perturbed vector nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation [16].\nArnold diffusion can be proved for discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation under certain Hamiltonian perturbation [29].\n\n3. Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence\nThe success in proving the existence of chaos in near integrable partial\ndifferential equations naturally leads to the question of proving the existence of chaos in Navier-Stokes equations (NS) in the high Reynolds\nnumber (near Euler equations) regime. Like Lorenz system among systems of ODE, chaos in Navier-Stokes equations gathers the most interest.\nUnlike Lorenz system, high Reynolds number Navier-Stokes equations\nare a lot like near integrable systems, and Euler equations are a lot like\nintegrable systems.\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n31.\n\n7\n\nLax Pairs of Euler Equations\n\nThe 2D Euler equation can be written in the vorticity form,\n\u2202t \u03a9 + {\u03a8, \u03a9} = 0 ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere the bracket { , } is defined as\n{f, g} = (\u2202x f )(\u2202y g) \u2212 (\u2202y f )(\u2202x g) ,\n\u03a9 is the vorticity, and \u03a8 is the stream function given by,\nu = \u2212\u2202y \u03a8 ,\n\nv = \u2202x \u03a8 ,\n\nand the relation between vorticity \u03a9 and stream function \u03a8 is,\n\u03a9 = \u2202x v \u2212 \u2202y u = \u2206\u03a8 .\nTheorem 5. [15] The Lax pair of the 2D Euler equation (3.8) is\ngiven as\n\u001a\nL\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6 ,\n(3.9)\n\u2202t \u03c6 + A\u03c6 = 0 ,\nwhere\n\nL\u03c6 = {\u03a9, \u03c6} ,\n\nA\u03c6 = {\u03a8, \u03c6} ,\n\nand \u03bb is a complex constant, and \u03c6 is a complex-valued function.\nStarting from a Lax pair, one can try to develop a Darboux transformation which is the key in the success in proving the existence of\nchaos in near integrable PDE. Some progress is made in establishing the\nDarboux transformation for 2D Euler equation. Consider the Lax pair\n(3.9) at \u03bb = 0, i.e.\n{\u03a9, p} = 0 ,\n\u2202t p + {\u03a8, p} = 0 ,\n\n(3.10)\n(3.11)\n\nwhere we replaced the notation \u03c6 by p.\nTheorem 6. [17] Let f = f (t, x, y) be any fixed solution to the\nsystem (3.10, 3.11), we define the Gauge transform Gf :\np\u0303 = Gf p =\n\n1\n[px \u2212 (\u2202x ln f )p] ,\n\u03a9x\n\n(3.12)\n\nand the transforms of the potentials \u03a9 and \u03a8:\n\u03a8\u0303 = \u03a8 + F ,\n\n\u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9 + \u2206F ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere F is subject to the constraints\n{\u03a9, \u2206F } = 0 ,\n\n{\u2206F, F } = 0 .\n\n(3.14)\n\n\f8\n\nY. Charles Li\n\nThen p\u0303 solves the system (3.10, 3.11) at (\u03a9\u0303, \u03a8\u0303). Thus (3.12) and (3.13)\nform the Darboux transformation for the 2D Euler equation (3.8) and\nits Lax pair (3.10, 3.11).\nFor KdV equation and many other soliton equations, the Gauge\ntransform is of the form [33],\np\u0303 = px \u2212 (\u2202x ln f )p .\nIn general, Gauge transform does not involve potentials. For 2D Euler\nequation, a potential factor \u03a91x is needed. From (3.10), one has\npy\npx\n=\n.\n\u03a9x\n\u03a9y\nThe Gauge transform (3.12) can be rewritten as\np\u0303 =\n\nfx p\nfy p\npy\npx\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n.\n\u03a9x\n\u03a9x f\n\u03a9y\n\u03a9y f\n\nThe Lax pair (3.10, 3.11) has a symmetry, i.e. it is invariant under the\ntransform (t, x, y) \u2192 (\u2212t, y, x). The form of the Gauge transform (3.12)\nresulted from the inclusion of the potential factor \u03a91x , is consistent with\nthis symmetry.\nThe 3D Euler equation can be written in vorticity form,\n\u2202t \u03a9 + (u * \u2207)\u03a9 \u2212 (\u03a9 * \u2207)u = 0 ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere u = (u1 , u2 , u3 ) is the velocity, \u03a9 = (\u03a91 , \u03a92 , \u03a93 ) is the vorticity,\n\u2207 = (\u2202x , \u2202y , \u2202z ), \u03a9 = \u2207 \u00d7 u, and \u2207 * u = 0. u can be represented by \u03a9\nfor example through Biot-Savart law.\nTheorem 7. [17] The Lax pair of the 3D Euler equation (3.15) is\ngiven as\n\u001a\nL\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6 ,\n(3.16)\n\u2202t \u03c6 + A\u03c6 = 0 ,\nwhere\n\nL\u03c6 = (\u03a9 * \u2207)\u03c6 ,\n\nA\u03c6 = (u * \u2207)\u03c6 ,\n\n\u03bb is a complex constant, and \u03c6 is a complex scalar-valued function.\nOur hope is that the infinitely many conservation laws generated\nby \u03bb \u2208 C can provide a priori estimates for the global well-posedness\nof 3D Navier-Stokes equations, or better understanding on the global\nwell-posedness.\nNotice that the equation (3.15) without the constraint \u03a9 = \u2207 \u00d7\nu and \u2207 * u = 0 is a compatibility condition of the Lax pair (3.16).\nIn general, Lax pairs can support finite time blow up solutions. Our\nconjecture here is that adding only the first constraint \u03a9 = \u2207 \u00d7 u, the\nequation (3.15) may have finite time blow up solutions which will be\nremoved by the second constraint \u2207 * u = 0.\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n32.\n\n9\n\nInvariant Manifolds and Their Zero-Viscosity Limits\n\nTo begin a dynamical system study on Navier-Stokes equations, one\nneeds to study the spectra of their linearizations at fixed points and\ntheir invariant manifolds.\nFollowing the notations of (3.8) and (3.15), we shall study the\nNavier-Stokes equations in the forms:\n\u2202t \u03a9 + {\u03a8, \u03a9} = \u03bd[\u2206\u03a9 + f (x)] ,\n\n(3.17)\n\n\u2202t \u03a9 + (u * \u2207)\u03a9 \u2212 (\u03a9 * \u2207)u = \u03bd[\u2206\u03a9 + f (x)] ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nfor 2D, and\n\nfor 3D where \u03bd is the viscosity, \u2206 is the Laplacian, and f (x) is the body\nforce. Periodic boundary condition is imposed.\nTheorem 8. [26] When \u03bd > 0, any fixed point of NS has invariant\nmanifolds. The provable size of the invariant manifolds shrinks to zero\nas \u03bd \u2192 0+ .\nThe interesting open question is: Can the size of some invariant\nmanifold be O(1) as \u03bd \u2192 0+ ?\nFor simple examples of fixed points, detailed information on the\nspectra of the corresponding linear NS operator can be obtained [26]\n[13] [8]. In the 2D case, consider the simple shear \u03a9\u2217 = cos y defined on\nthe rectangular periodic domain [0, 2\u03c0/\u03b1] \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0] where 1/2 < \u03b1 < 1.\nThe corresponding linear NS operator decouples into infinitely many\nsub-operators labeled by (k\u03021 , k\u03022 ) \u2208 Z2 /{0}.\nTheorem 9. [26] The spectra of the 2D linear NS operator have\nthe following properties labeled by (k\u03021 , k\u03022 ):\n1. (\u03b1k\u03021 )2 +(k\u03022 +n)2 > 1, \u2200n \u2208 Z.

Setting \u03bd = 0, the only eigenvalue is \u03bb = 0 of\ninfinite multiplicity with the same eigenfunctions as above.\n\n\f10\n\nY. Charles Li\n3. k\u03021 = \u22121, k\u03022 = 0. (a). \u03bd > 0.

Finally, when \u03bd = 0, the union of all the above pieces of continuous\nspectra is the imaginary axis iR.\nIn general, for any fixed point of NS, the spectrum of the linear\nNS operator consists of only eigenvalues which lie in a parabolic region\n[26]. The above theorem establishes some properties of the zero-viscosity\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n11\n\nlimits of these eigenvalues for a simple shear. From numerical simulations on many examples [7], these eigenvalues often undergo fascinating\ndeformations in the zero-viscosity limits, which can be classified into the\nfollowing four categories:\n1. Persistence: These are the eigenvalues that persist and approach\nto the eigenvalues of the corresponding linear Euler operator when\nthe viscosity approaches zero. (e.g. at 2D and 3D shears, and cat's\neye.)\n2. Condensation: These are the eigenvalues that approach and form\na continuous spectrum for the corresponding linear Euler operator\nwhen the viscosity approaches zero. (e.g. at 2D and 3D shears,\ncat's eye, and ABC flow.)\n3. Singularity: These are the eigenvalues that approach to a set that\nis not in the spectrum of the corresponding linear Euler operator\nwhen the viscosity approaches zero. (e.g. at 2D and 3D shears.)\n4. Addition: This is a subset of the spectrum of the linear Euler\noperator, which has no overlap with the zero viscosity limit set of\nthe spectrum of the linear NS operator. (e.g. cat's eye.)\nInvestigating the zero-viscosity limit is very important for studying\nthe NS dynamics near the Euler regime. By a combination of numerics\nand analysis in [7], we have tried to push the Melnikov integral tool into\nthe study on chaotic dynamics of NS. One interesting question is the\nconjecture that Euler equations have heteroclinics [7].\nProving the existence of chaos in NS will provide a foundation for\ncontrol of turbulence. Control of turbulence depends on the information\nthat supports the existence of chaos. In fact, control can be regarded\nas an extra boby force in the NS equations. Thus, control of chaos\n(turbulence) is a sub-problem of existence of chaos (turbulence). From\nthis perspective, investigating the existence of chaos in NS has great\nindustrial value.\n\n33.\n\nGlobal Regularity of Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nA notable mathematical problem on 3D Navier-Stokes equations is the\nglobal regularity problem which was chosen as one of the seven Clay\nproblems. Specifically, the fact [9] that\nZ Z\n|\u2207u|2 dx dt\nbeing bounded only implies\nZ\n\n|\u2207u|2 dx\n\n\f12\n\nY. Charles Li\n\nbeing bounded for almost all t, is the key of the difficulty. In fact,\nLeray was able to show that the possible exceptional set of t is actually\na compact set of measure zero. There have been a lot of more recent\nworks on describing this exceptional compact set [2]. The claim that\nthis possible exceptional compact set is actually empty, will imply the\nglobal regularity and the solution of the problem. The hope for such a\nclaim seems slim. There are weaker conditions implying global regularity,\ne.g. L4 norm of velocity being bounded for t in the exceptional set [4]\n[37]. But I think the weak and the strong conditions will be true or\nfalse simultaneously. There are several alternative ways of approaching\nthe global regularity problem [35] including the Lax pair for 3D Euler\nequations in a previous subsection.\nEven for ordinary differential equations, often one can not prove\ntheir global well-posedness, but their solutions on computers look perfectly globally regular and sometimes chaotic. Chaos and global regularity are compatible. The hallmark of chaotic solutions is their sensitive\ndependence on initial conditions. That is, a small change in the initial\nconditions will lead to a huge change after sufficiently long time, while\nall the solutions are kept in a bounded region in the phase space. This\nleads to the unpredictability, not irregularity, of chaotic solutions. The\nfact that fluid experimentalists quickly discovered shocks in compressible\nfluids and never found any finite time blow up in incompressible fluids,\nindicates that there might be no finite time blow up in 3D Navier-Stokes\nequations (even Euler equations). On the other hand, the solutions of\n3D Navier-Stokes equations can definitely be turbulent.\nReplacing the viscous term \u03bd \u2206u by higher order derivatives, one\ncan prove the global regularity [6]. This leaves the global regularity of\na more challenging and interesting mathematical problem. Assume that\nthe unthinkable event happens, that is, someone proves the existence of\na meaningful finite time blow up in 3D NS, then fluid experimentalists\nneed to identify such a finite time blow up in the experiments. If they fail,\nthen the choice will be whether or not to replace the viscous term \u03bd \u2206u in\nthe Navier-Stokes equations by higher order derivatives to better model\nthe fluid motion. Such a freedom was allowed in the original derivation\nof NS. Specifically, the fluid shear stress can depend on second or higher\nderivatives of velocity besides the fluid strain given by first derivatives\nof velocity.\nThe global regularity and turbulence are separate problems. Turbulence is more of a dynamical system problem. Of course, global attractors depend on global well-posedness [3]. Often a detailed local dynamical system study does not depend on global well-posedness. Local\nwell-posedness is often enough. In fact, this is the case in my proof on\nthe existence of chaos in partial differential equations [25].\n\n\fChaos in Partial Differential Equations\n\n34.\n\n13\n\nSearching for an Effective Description of Chaotic\n(Turbulent) Solutions Beyond the Reynolds Average\n\nOf the greatest industrial value is an effective description of chaotic (turbulent) solutions beyond the Reynolds average. From what we learn\nabout chaos in partial differential equations [25], turbulent solutions not\nonly have sensitive dependences on initial conditions, but also are densely\npacked inside a domain in the phase space. They are far away from the\nfeature of fluctuations around a mean. In fact, they wander around in\na fat domain rather than a thin domain in the phase space. Therefore,\naveraging makes no sense at all. One has to seek other descriptions. In\n[30], an interesting \"segment description\" is proposed.\n\nReferences\n[1] K. Alligood, T. Sauer, J.
