The ENUM\nprotocol uses Internet Domain Name System (DNS) based naming and resolution\nmechanisms to map E.164 telephony numbers into other numbering addresses, especially\nIP based addresses (URLs, E-mail address, IP phone, Call setup signaling server, etc.).\nAccordingly, ENUM creates addressing mechanisms for IP telephony and also enables\n\n1\n\n\fnew services using E.164 numbers as integrated identifiers for users and/or services.\nMulti-service gateway applications will be available for both telephony and the Internet\nusing addressing technology like ENUM.\nThe main advantage of ENUM is the converged IP-PSTN network that will exploit the\nnetwork externality and utilizing one phone number for any other identifiers. For IP\nusers, it connects IP-based terminals to cheap and ubiquitous PSTN phones, while\nbypassing costly PSTN long distance circuits. It also allows PSTN users to interwork\nwith IP-based networks by allowing PSTN terminals to reach both PSTN and IP network\nusers.\nTherefore, ENUM will create many new market opportunities. Already various market\nplayers are avidly pursuing them. Also, it raises important policy issues related to the\nimplementation and administration of the ENUM database and services. As such it is\nreceiving significant attention from telecommunication regulators and policy makers at\nthe national and international level. ITU's recent World Telecommunications Policy\nForum 2001 dealt with the emergence of ENUM as an important numbering issue of IP\ntelephony [WTPF, 2001]. Policy issues frequently discussed include the impact of\nENUM on carrier selection, bypass, interconnection, registry competition, registrar\neligibility and numbering authority for ENUM identifier. This paper analyzes these\nimportant emerging issues of ENUM provisioning, administration and policy by taking\nan empirical research approach.\nMost discussions of ENUM proceed from the top down. They discuss the architecture\nand technical capabilities of the service and the organization of authority over the\ndatabase. This paper uses a bottom-up approach to analyze the issues. We begin by\nidentifying potential ENUM services and estimating the size of the associated service\nmarket opportunities, focusing particularly on IP telephony. Identifying the additional\nmarket potential available to new ENUM-based services for different players in the\nrelated industry, we analyze the possible administrative models and relationship scenarios\namong different ENUM players such as Registry(ies), Registrars, Telephone Service\nProviders, ENUM Application Service Providers, etc.. We generalize the recently\nproposed IETF ENUM administrative models [Pfautz, 2001] to represent various ENUMbased services and administration scenarios. Then, we assess the effects of various\nadministrative model architectures of ENUM service by looking at the market\nopportunities and motivations. From the empirical findings, we will draw the\nimplications on transactions among different kinds of ENUM service providers. Finally,\nthe results of the model analysis will be used for the discussion of policy related issues\naround the ENUM and IP telephony services.\n\n2\n\nBrief Background and Overview\n\nThe purpose of this section is to outline the key functionalities and operations of ENUM.\nMore definitive discussions can be found elsewhere.\n\n2\n\n\f2.1 ENUM Basic Functionality\nENUM is a name devised by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to refer to the\nprotocol (RFC 2916, \"E164 number and DNS\") designed by its Telephone Number\nMapping working group. Based on Domain Name System (DNS) operation, ENUM\nprotocol provides the functionalities of the resolution of a telephone number to a Uniform\nResource Identifier (URI) that can relate a range of service resources. ENUM can\nprovide services connecting E.164 telephone numbers to Internet telephony-oriented\nservices by enabling telephone users or entities to access Internet based resources. It\nmakes extensive use of Naming Authority Pointer Records (NAPTR) defined in\nRFC2915 to identify available ways or services for contacting a specific party identified\nby the E.164 number.\n2.2 ENUM E.164 Number Resolution Scheme: RFC2916 [Faltsrom, 2000]\nIn RFC 2916, the domain \"e164.arpa\" is proposed as the root of the DNS naming\nhierarchy for storage of E.164 numbers. This domain is further divided into sub domains\nto facilitate distributed operations. E.164 number resolution is the process of finding the\nDNS name for a specific E.164 number. It is briefly described as follows:\n1. Start with a complete E.164 telephone number.\nExample: +1-315-443-4473\n2. Remove all characters other than digits except for the leading \"+\", which is to\nflag that the number in query is an E.164 number.\nExample: +13154434473\n3. Remove all characters other than digits.\nExample: 13154434473\n4. Insert a \".\" between each digit and at the end.\nExample: 1.3.1.5.4.4.3.4.4.7.3\n5. Reverse the order of all the digits.\nExample: 3.7.4.4.3.4.4.5.1.3.1\n6. Append, as a suffix, the string of \"e.164.arpa\".\nExample: 3.7.4.4.3.4.4.5.1.3.1.e164.arpa.\nThere can be two potential implementations of ENUM domain names. RFC 2916\nsuggests that the domain names standardized under e164.arpa, which will result in one\nENUM root structure. However, multiple domain implementation rooted under different\ndomain names would be possible in the market place if there is no regulatory restriction\nor policy regarding ENUM domain policy. We just named those domains as \"any\" in\nthe illustration of Figure 1. The competitive multiple ENUM root implementation would\nrequire associated ENUM registry discovery mechanisms and peering interconnection of\n\n3\n\n\fregistries and .arpa domain implementation will be managed on the planned and\nprovisioned hierarchy of the domain resources.

Most of them adopt similar structures that contain registry,\nregistrar, and ENUM Application Service Providers (ASPs), with different views of who\nand how they will participate in each entity. Here we suggest generic version of ENUM\nmarket players and their functions.\n\u2022 Pointer to ENUM Registry (Tier-0)\nThis will point to a Registry that is an authoritative name server for that country code\nor portion of a country code. Internet Architecture Board recommend the Reseaux IP\nEuropean Network Control Center (RIPE-NCC) maintains the e164.arpa\nimplementation. However, for the competitive and multiple registry roots, there is no\nsuch centralized database suggested yet.\n\n4\n\n\f\u2022 National Registry (Tier-1)\nRegistry (ies) will manage name servers whose entries point to Service Registrar for\na Telephone number. Candidates include domain name registry, telephone number\nregistry, or a new provisioning body. There are two competing models:\n\u2022 A regulated national monopoly administrative structure\n\u2022 An open level competitive administrative structure\n\u2022 Registrar (Tier-2)\nRegistrars database providers that host NAPTR Records for a Telephone number.\nCompeting model players include:\n\u2022 Any properly accredited domain name registrar\n\u2022 TNAAs (Telephone Number Assignment Authorities)\n\u2022 Telephone Service Provider (TSP)\n\u2022 ENUM Application Service Providers: Any organizations or enterprises\nthat provide ENUM related services such as Internet Telephony Service\nProviders (ITSPs), ISPs, and other web-based service providers.\nIn the following, the players related to the ENUM provisioning model are categorized as\nthe groups that share the same business motivations. Since telephone companies play\nseveral roles as E.164 Number Providers, traditional telephony service providers, and\nfacilities-based service providers, the TSP's motivation in ENUM implementation and\nprovisioning model will depend on each of these roles.\n\u2022\n\nEnd Users\nEnd users are the consumers that include not only the individual users but also\nbusinesses and organizations that need services either from the ASPs or directly\nfrom the Facilities-based Service Providers (FSPs).\n\n\u2022\n\nFacilities-based Service Providers (FSPs)\nServices include fixed telephony, private leased circuits, mobile services, Internet\nconnections, and other services. TSPs (ILECs amd CLECs) and ISPs are included\nin a sense that they own the facilities and the network. ISPs are categorized as\nFacility-based Service Providers whether they own and operate the network or\nthey lease. ISPs are considered to be separate from the Application Service\nProviders (ASPs).\n\n\u2022\n\nApplication Service Providers (ASPs)\nASPs include ITSPs and other potential ENUM application service providers.\nServices include voice resale, IP Telephony, International callback, aggregator,\nrebiller, in-building communication services and other value-added\ntelecommunication services. Voice Portals, that provide applications such as call\ncenter/web integration and voice powered e-commerce, are also included as\nASPs. They will become an important source for mobile users. New voice\nservices will complement microbrowsers, helping get data into and out of small\nhandheld devices.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nKey ENUM Service Market Potential: Bottom-Up\n\n3.1 Major Potential Services\n3.1.1\n\nBasic IP telephony service potential\n\nIP Telephony is likely to be the first application of ENUM that will drive the market.\nSince it is the basic service that will take a full advantage for general users who are\nconnected in both PSTN and IP network, current ENUM issues such as administration\nand policy analysis can be based on this service. Currently there are many IP Telephony\nservices available, but with critical limitations such as limited user base for each service\nprovider and no service or different dialing for phone-to-PC connection. Once the\nprovisioning model is developed, ENUM will solve these problems without significant\ntechnical challenge by maintaining a single logical database for all the telephone numbers\nand mapping them to other URIs.\n3.1.2\n\nValue added services potential with added functions\n\nMany of the services that use simple text format may be interoperable by text-voice\nconverting services. For example, a telephone user can send email to someone on an IP\nnetwork using a voice \u2194 text service. It may also be possible to develop some new\nterminal devices that connect via the PSTN to integrate the two networks, such as PDAs\nwith cellphone functions, IP video conferencing, and Web TV. However, revolutionary\nchanges in the type of access devices used would eliminate the advantage of ENUM,\nwhich is its ability to connect the installed base of telephone users to other networks.\nUnified Messaging Service (UMS) is an example in between the basic service and\nservices with a moderate degree of added functions. In addition to existing services, new\nservices for specific user group such as intranet in an organization may be developed.\nCall forwarding is an example. To develop a specific service that would be technically\nfeasible and profitable at the same time, each service should be examined in detail.\nMoving onto the second generation of IP Telephony, Intelligent Network (IN) services\nsuch as 800 toll-free service, local number portability, and calling card services are\ncomplemented in IP networks as well as PSTN, by using Signaling System 7 (SS7)/ IP\ngateways supporting IP Telephony switches. As IP Telephony matures, those services\nwill be expected as basic on top of the internetworking rather than creating a new market.\nHowever, consolidated NAPTR Resource Records of ENUM may enable new services\nthat manage bundled accounts and billings that will be offered by ASPs as enhanced\nservices.\n3.2 Major Potential Service Market Estimation and Opportunities\n3.2.2\n\nIP Telephony\n\nLow cost is not the only incentive for IP telephony with today's low rate for circuitswitched call. Both individual and business consumers want new applications, high\nbandwidth, business solutions, reliability and QoS (Quality of Service). Although they\ndo not have strong buying power because of the high demand in data communication\n6\n\n\fneeds, as the competition moves from price to new services, they want more multimedia\napplications and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based services such as web-integrated\ncall centers, multimedia conferencing, IP Conferencing, unified messaging etc.\nMultinational corporations can save 40% on international and domestic calls by\nintegrating voice and data on a single IP network. Smaller companies also benefit from\nmanaging a single network and applications. Many forecasts show IP Telephony\nexploding in the near future, though one should be cautious of hype. IP LAN Telephony\nmarket will increase by almost 90 percent per year for the next five years, from $138M in\n2000 to $3.2B by 2005. [PR Newswire, 2001] Since end-users want both new services\nand integration, they will have a strong incentive to subscribe to ENUM services as long\nas the incremental cost is not substantial.\n\u0003\nInternet\nUsers,\n(k)\nPC-toPhone\nUsers,\n(k)\nUsage,\n(k mins)\nMarket\nSize,\n($M)\n\n\u0003\nWorld\n% Growth\nUSA\n% Growth\nWorld\n% of Internet Users\nUSA\n% of Internet Users\nWorld\nUSA\nWorld\n\n2000\n177,464\n76,500\n5,137\n2.89\n2,861\n3.74\n3,361\n1,806\n185\n\n2001\n239,939\n35.2\n95,414\n24.7\n11,324\n4.72\n5,710\n5.98\n10,920\n5,924\n512\n\n2002\n311,194\n29.7\n118,679\n24.4\n22,394\n7.2\n10,624\n8.95\n29,614\n15,578\n1,201\n\n2003\n391,500\n25.8\n137,849\n16.2\n40,364\n10.31\n17,427\n12.64\n69,036\n33,956\n2,431\n\n2004\n495,685\n26.6\n155,581\n12.9\n69,328\n13.99\n26,439\n16.99\n139,634\n63,712\n4,190\n\nUSA\n87\n234\n517\n948\n1,478\nFig. 3-1 IP Telephony: Exploiting Market Opportunities [IPMARKET, 2001]\n\nFig. 3-1 shows forecasts of the growth of Internet users and PC-to-Phone users. The\nnumbers imply that the users are growing at a rate of 25-30% annually. The potential\nmarket for ENUM, however, might grow even faster because it will enable phone-to-PC\ncalls, and hence include all the telephone users and wireless users. Furthermore, it will\nalso stimulate the existing PC-to-phone calls as well as the overall Internet uses,\nespecially broadband connections. It is expected that after 2003, more than 10% of the\nInternet users worldwide will use the Internet to call regular PSTN phones. Wireless is\nanother rapidly growing market and the 3rd generation wireless will take a full advantage\nof ENUM with its data communication-ready interface. Fig. 3-2 shows the potential\nENUM market (IP telephony call to the Internet Phones and PCs) in revenue and the\nnumber of subscribers that includes phone lines and mobile phones and total Internet use.\nWe assumed 5% penetration for such users as the potential market. The USA market\nestimates for 2002 are based on the growing rate of the world market and the portion of\nthe USA market to the world market. With such assumptions, we could derive the\npotential market generated for phone-PC IP telephony will have about 25M subscribers\nand $11B worldwide market potential at the end of year 2002. Assuming Phone-to-PC\nand PC-phone users are same users, we can draw an estimation that the potential IP-\n\n7\n\n\ftelephony user base for ENUM addressing number service could reach upto 25M\nsubscribers by the end of the year 2002.\n3.2.2\n\nUnified Messaging Service (UMS)\n\nUnified Messaging Service may be considered as an extended application to IP\nTelephony that will utilize ENUM service as well. However, it has a potential to provide\nmuch broader range of services if integrated with other technologies such as VXML,\nspeech recognition, and text-to-voice. [Datacomm, 2000] Voice, email, fax, and other\nmultimedia messages will be accessed and updated through one server directly to\ncentralized universal directories in the future UM message process, instead of using\ndifferent server for each type of messages and then transferring them into the directories.\n3.3 ENUM Players in Major Potential Service Markets\nIn this section, we will define and describe the major corporate players at Tier 1 and Tier\n2 who will shape the interface between ENUM and IP telephony service.\n3.3.2\n\nTSPs \u2013Incumbents (ILECs)\n\nWhile the economic advantage of IP Telephony drove the growing market, IP Telephony\nhas been a threat to established voice carriers, especially to the long distance carriers\n(IXCs). Their existing revenue streams may be cannibalized by a shift to VoIP. Figure 34 shows that long distance telephone revenue was already declining in the past two years\nand is expected to continue to do so in the future. Even if VoIP is cheaper for carriers on\nthe supply side, it may not be economically rational to move immediately towards\nproviding telephony services over an IP platform. The speed of transition will depend on\nthe degree of competition and whether a particular carrier is an incumbent or a new\nmarket entrant. [IPTelephonyWorkshop,2000]\nIncumbent carriers that already have existing revenue streams and the traditional network\nwill gradually deploy IP Telephony for the following benefits:\n\u2022\n\nMore efficient use of bandwidth (64 kbps for traditional vs. 6 kbps for IP call by\ncodec used to snip out the pauses and quiet parts of speech)\n\n\u2022\n\nMarket for corporate VoIP (17% of US businesses began the implementation of IP\nLAN Telephony in 2000, will grow to 80% in four years [Philips])\n\n\u2022\n\nOperators in developing countries may be better advised to embrace IP Telephony,\nand bear the consequences of reduced per-minute revenues from long-distance and\ninternational services, than to risk missing the opportunity to develop revenues in\nfuture growth areas [IP TelephonyWorkshop, 2000].\n\n\u2022\n\nLower revenues from international traffic may be compensated through higher\nrevenues from Internet access services, from selling more network capacity to users\nsuch as ISDN and second line, and from higher volume of local Internet calls. It\n\n8\n\n\fcould also stimulate people to make more international calls, via Internet but also the\nPSTN.

The numbers indicate that,\ndespite the various speed of deployment, TSPs are moving into the IP-based network for\ntheir services in the future. As the incumbent TSPs are moving toward the IP-based\nservices, the importance and benefits of ENUM for number mapping and address\nresolution will increase. The ILECs will have incentives to create their own (probably)\nresolution architecture for their potential market due to the increase of IP-based services.\nTherefore, expected strategies from ILECs on ENUM resolution policy would be the\nposition where they can keep their numbering resource resolution capability no matter\nwhich ENUM service provider the ENUM registrant choose.\n3.3.3\n\nTSPs \u2013New Market Entrants (CLECs and IXCs)\n\nNew local telephony market entrants such as CLECs and IXCs will be more\nadvantageous because they own the facilities for voice, data, and Internet access with\nmodern networks; hence they can provide converged services with IP telephony and\nENUM. They can also price more freely than a regulated monopoly, and they can bundle\nlocal and long-distance services ahead of the incumbent carriers. [Computer Reseller,\n1998]\nCurrently, most new entrants are focusing on specific client types such as\ncommercial businesses instead of home subscribers. As such, CLECs are growing\nrapidly in metropolitan regions while not maintaining any network infrastructure between\nregions. With IP telephony, the both CLECs and IXCs can easily connect their regions\ntogether over a private IP network allowing low cost intra-network calling. IP telephony\ngateways can become the glue to merge their metro PSTN networks together instead of\nrelying on other PSTN service provider who charge an excessive rate for access. Other\nadvantages that the new market entrants have include lower cost for infrastructure\n(equipment cost less and occupies 90 percent less space) and faster market entrance.\nMore of CLECs provide the IP-based services and they are evidently motivated to utilize\nENUM enabled service infrastructure. Having ENUM based address management,\nCLECs and IXCs would be able to have more independence from ILECs of providing the\nbasic and enhanced IP telephony services. This will motivate new entrant TSPs to\ndevelop a capability in the ENUM numbering resolution.\n3.3.4\n\nISPs\n\nAnother possible player in ENUM or IP telephony architecture is the Internet service\nprovider. However, if the Internet were to be connected to the telephone system in a\nwidespread way, it is not clear who would install, operate and benefit from the gateways.\nAs mentioned previously, CLECs and IXCs will benefit directly from the gateways. For\nISPs, it requires a way to tie the lower-level Internet service to the higher-level IP\nTelephony service, an example of vertical integration in the Internet industry. [Clark,\n1997] Several IP telephony cost analysis shows that transport cost is the largest part of\ntotal cost to deploy Internet Telephony for both ISPs and TSPs. [Leida, 1997][Weiss,\n1998] The competitive advantage of an ISP would be efficiency of operating its network,\nsuch as economies of scale, facilities-based networks, and network optimization\n\n10\n\n\ftechniques. In any case, whoever installs, operates, and provides the gateway services\nmust bill someone for the use. Anyone who will use and operate those gateways will\nhave incentives utilizing the ENUM capability for their customers.\nC ostofC allto Telcos\n12\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\n10\n8\n\n\u0003\n\u0005\n\b\n\u0003\n\u0007\n\u0006\n\u0002\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\n6\n\nIP call\n\n4\n\nswitched call\n\n2\n0\n2001\n\n2003\n\nFigure 3-4 Cost of Call to Telcos [The economist, 2001]\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0007\b\u0005 \u0004 \u0006 \u0006 \u000e\u0006\u000f\u0005\u0010\u0005\b\u0011 \u0012\u0006\u0013\u0014\u0003 \u0015\u0016\u0006\u0002 \u0006\u0007\u0017\u0010\u0010\u0004\u0018\u0002 \u0019\n$\u0005\u0002\u0003\n\u0007\b\u0005 \u0004 \u001e\u0006\u0004 !\u001e\u001c\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n!\u001e\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n%\u0004\u0010\u0010\u0004\n\u001e\u001c\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001e\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001f\u001e\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001d\u001e\u001c\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001d\u001e\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001c\u001a\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001a\u001b\u001a\n\u001d\"\"#\n\u001d\"\"\"\n\u001f\u001a\u001a\u001d\n\u001f\u001a\u001a\n\u001f\u001a\u001a\u001c\nFigure 3-5 Carrier Spending on IP Telephony [Frost et al.]\n3.3.5\n\nASPs\n\nFinally, ENUM Application Service Providers (ASPs) may be categorized as those who\ndoes not own any facility based transport and switching network, but have revenues from\nvarious applications related to ENUM service capability. Potential ASPs including\nInternet Telephony Service Providers, Corporations, Call Centers, and Service Bureaus\n\n11\n\n\fare the ones that directly generate the revenues from the service; hence their motivation is\nrelatively clear. The success of each of them would be decided by the market through\nfree competition, and greatly dependant on the profit model and how innovative the\napplications they offer. They will have incentives to reach the end customers with\nENUM enabled services as Tier 2 of the ENUM services.\n\n4\n\nENUM Administration Market Reference Model Analysis\n\nIn this section, we will set out six different administration models for ENUM and\nexamine their relationship to the key players described in Section 3.3. Depending on the\nENUM administration functions of the players, there could be several administration\nmodels and scenarios. For example, we can expect a monopolistic infrastructure or open\ncompetitive market for ENUM resolution service according to proposed administration\nmodels.\nSince the ENUM resolution process is combined with the domain name\nregistration process and the carrier selection process, the relationships are complex.\nFurther, the implementation and administration of ENUM are closely related to policy\nand regulation issues.\n4.1 Model Assumptions\nAs this is a first order analysis, there are some simplifying assumptions that we wish to\nmake. These include:\n\u2022\n\nThe Tier 1 entity, i.e., the registry, handles the sub-domain of e.164.arpa\ncorresponding to a particular country code and points each served telephone\nnumber to Tier 2. We did not make any restriction who can be the Tier 1 registry\nservice providers. The registry knows the Telephone Number Assignment\nAuthority and TSP for each telephone number. We assume that a registry\ndiscovery mechanism is in place when multiple registries and roots are\nimplemented.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn Tier 2, the entity that acts as a registrar could be a Telephone Service Provider\n(TSP), an Internet Service Provider (ISP), an Application Service Provider (ASP)\nor an independent registrar. Tier 2 registrars must control the access rights to the\nNAPTR RRs so that TSP, ISP, ASP or Independent registrar can provision, access\nand change their own NAPTR RRs. For example, a TSP has authority over\nprovisioning of the NAPTR RRs at the Tier 2 for network-related services. All\nNaming Authority Pointer Resource Records (NAPTR RRs) for a given telephone\nnumber must be stored in a registrar's name server.\n\n\u2022\n\nTelephone Service Providers (TSP) may offer the same application service to\nusers as Application Service Providers (ASPs).\n\n\u2022\n\nThe ENUM subscriber can select any registrar to use for its assigned telephone\nnumber. The user can use the ENUM service as a personal number service and\n\n12\n\n\fcan subscribe to many application services from various providers, including\nhis/her Telephone Service Providers.\n\u2022\n\nThe ENUM subscriber can change the registrar without informing the current\nserving registrar. In this case, the new registrar may inform the old registrar and\nalso inform registry about registrar change for the telephone number.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe ENUM subscriber can lose his/her rights to the assigned telephone number\nand ENUM services when he/she disconnects the telephone service and no longer\nowns the telephone number. However, if he/she wants to have the telephone\nnumber only for using telephone service, he/ she can disconnect just ENUM\nservice.\n\n4.2 Six Reference Model Analyses\nIndustries for ENUM-based services can be developed effectively with the appropriate\npolicy on the administration models for different ENUM players. The industry and\npolicy bodies are recently working over various scenarios of tier 1 implementation and\ntier 2 operation to come up with the consensus on appropriate ENUM administration\npolicy. Different players have different business interest and incentives to have the\npresence in the ENUM services. It is not an easy task to identify a model that satisfy all\ndifferent players' interests. There was a previous study on the ENUM administration\nprocess and reference model by Pfautz et al. [Pfautz, 2001]. The study was based on the\nassumption of single registry scenario and focused on the technical interface of the\nENUM administration process. In this paper, we examine the ENUM administration\nmodels for both single registry and multiple registry scenarios and further focus on the\nbusiness industry structure and incentives of different administration scenario models.\nThe analyses of different models will be conducted to draw the implications to address\nimportant telecommunication policy issues surrounding ENUM services and markets.\nSix reference models are presented here. Model 1,2,3 are based on one registry that can\nmake authoritative one, and other models from 4 to 6 have multiple registries (both sublayer and independent layer approach) of competitive one. According to the role of Tier 2\nentities, functions among entities could be changed.\n4.2.1\n\nModel 1\n\nIn this first model, the Telephone Service Provider (TSP) that currently provides the\ntelephone service to the telephone number is the registrar, and there could be other\nregistrars that compete on equal terms. In addition to the principal role to assign\ntelephone number to the use for telephony service, the TSP can act as the ASP for the\nusers' application service by bundling the ENUM enabled applications into their existing\nservices. However, the user can decide which ASP to use. The TSP already has a service\nrelationship with the user so that it would be easier for the TSP to verify both the user's\nidentity and the telephone number assignment to that the user to authenticate to\nprovisioning request. The TSP will charge the end-users for ENUM registrar service and\n\n13\n\n\fthe TSP will pay the Registry for its registry database services. The registry service\ncharge will be generally the flat fee for each number. The TSPs can provide ENUM\nservice as part of their enhanced services. Also, TSPs might have chance to provide\nENUM subscription service with the assigned numbers for those who do not subscriber\nactual telephone service.\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\u00fa\u00f9\n.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00fc\u00fa\u00fc \u00fa\u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe \u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa\u00fc \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fb \u00fe \u00fa\u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nThe interface between registry and registrar is used when the new registrar is\nprovisioning its Resource Records (RRs) at the registry for telephone number. Also the\nregistry can inform user change from old registrar to new one.\nProtecting user's privacy might be well maintained among TSP registrars as long as there\nis no vertical integration of Tier 1 and 2 functions. The single registry service provider\nmight implement policy on the access of private ENUM records to approve registrars.\nThe interface between registrar and the Application Service Provider (ASP) is used by\nASP to provision, access and change the NAPTR RRs associated with the application\nservices for the telephone number at the tier 2 if the user gives it the authorization to do\nso. When the user subscribes to any specific service or terminates it, the ASP informs the\nTSP. Users can subscribe to special ENUM services through ENUM ASPs, who will act\nas registrants to the TSPs. ASPs might unbundle the ENUM registrar service and let the\nuser directly deal with the TSP's registrar service.\nThe interface between the new registrar and old registrar is used for resolving disputes\nabout user's registrar change. The new registrar should inform the old registrar\n\n14\n\n\fimmediately when the new subscriber changes it, and also retrieve the NAPTR RRs at the\nold registrar.\nThe interface between registrar and user is used when the user requests or terminates to\nENUM service from TSP, the registrar. The user also can authorize his/her ASPs for the\naccess right to their NAPTR RRs at the registrar for a user's assigned telephone number.\nThe interface between ASP and user is used by ASP to provide its NAPTR RRs or the\napplication service related information to user or to request the user to authorize to\nprovision, access and change its NAPTR RRs at the registrar. Also, the user can\nsubscribe or terminate application service(s) form ASP. Therefore, general ENUM\nservice value flow of the model 1 is from users and ASP through TSP to Registry. The\nTSPs, and ASPs will have incentives operate ENUM provisioning services in this model.\nIf the local telephony market among TSPs in the same region is competitive enough,\nregistrar market can operate in a reasonably competitive manner.\n4.2.2\n\nModel 2\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\u00fa\n.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00fc\u00fa\u00fc \u00fa\u00ff\u00fb\u00fb\u00fc\u00fa\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe \u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe \u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe \u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fb \u00fe\u00fa\u00fa\u00fc \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa\u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nIn this model, the Application Service Provider (ASP) plays a role as the registrar, and\nthere could be other registrars that function equally. Most interfaces are same as model 1.\nThe user must subscribe to TSP for telephony service and have the assigned telephone\nnumber. Those user who have telephone number assigned will get ENUM registrar\nservice from ENUM ASPs (who provide ENUM enabled services) and those ASPs will\npay the Registry for the ENUM service provisioning. For transparent operation of\n15\n\n\fENUM service in this model, there is an issue associated with the operation and\ncooperation from TSPs. There might be three approaches to motivate the operation of\nTSPs for ENUM provisioning domains; Registry directed, ASP directed and User\ndirected. It might be TSP's business decision in this ENUM business model.\nThe interface between ASP and user of this model is same as interface of model 1 except\nthe fact that it can have authorization directly from the user when he/she subscribes to\nENUM service.\nThe interface between TSP and user of this model may be used to open a new telephony\nservice account or to close it from the assigned telephone number.\nWhen the user wants to subscribe to ENUM service, he/she may authorize the selected\nASP to get all information about him/her from TSP. Also TSP can access the NAPTR\nRRs associated with the application services for the assigned user's telephone number if\nthe user gives it the authorization to do so.\nIn this model, the role of TSP is somewhat smaller than that of model 1, though the TSP\nhas its own principal role to assign a telephone number to the user for telephony service.\nFrom the user's view, he/she can select any ASP for ENUM service and that plays role as\nthe registrar here without contacting with TSP if he/she already has the assigned\ntelephone service. The ASP registrars should have appropriate authentication and access\ncontrol mechanisms either through outsourcing or development to interact with the Tier 1\nto ensure the user privacy protection.\nGeneral ENUM service value flow of this model is from users through ASPs to Registry\nand there might be independent economics and value flow from Registry, ASPs and users\nto TSPs depending on the business model of TSPs for ENUM services. This additional\nvalue stream will not only motivate the TSPs to cooperate with ASPs for ENUM\nprovisioning but also promote the competition among TSPs in ENUM service\nprovisioning domain.\n4.2.3\n\nModel 3\n\nIn this model 3, the independent registrar resides in tier 2 as the registrar. The\nindependent registrar means a designated entity that plays role as a registrar and has\nrelations with TSP, ASP and user for ENUM service. User might subscribe telephone\nservice, ENUM enabled application and ENUM registration independently. However, the\nregistry will collect the ENUM provisioning charging only from the independent\nRegistrar. TSP and ASPs will establish the business relationship with Registrar if there is\neconomic benefit of serving the end user.\nFor all interface in this model, each entity's principal function is same or very similar as\nthose of model 1 and model 2. However, the interfaces among entities are more complex\nthan other models, especially for users.\n\n16\n\n\fThe interface between independent registrar and TSP/ASP may be used by TSP and ASP\nto provision, access and change the NAPTR RRs associated with the network related\nservice and application service for the telephone number. Both of them can be done if the\nuser gives TSP and ASP the authorization to do so.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\u00fa\n.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fa\u00f9\u00fa \u00fa\n\u00fe \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fa \u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fa\u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00fd\u00fa \u00fa \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fa \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\u00ff\n\u00fb \u00fe \u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe \u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nFor the user privacy protection, it is essential that the single registry provider examine the\napproved independent registrars if they manage the user's privacy records correctly with\ncooperation with user's ASPs and TSPs. There will be emerging demand for the function\nto ensure that tier 2 registrars are properly handling the user privacy information with\nsecurity.\nIn this model, the direction of ENUM provisioning service value flow is from user\nthrough registrar to the registry. ENUM ASP will have close business relationship with\nregistrars since their main business is ENUM-based. TSP would have incentives to keep\nbusiness relationship with the independent registrar, however probably not with all\nregistrars.\n4.2.4\n\nModel 4\n\nThe different point of this model from previous models is that there are multiple\nregistries. Again, the ENUM registrars of this model are the TSPs that have capability to\nmanage the e164 number resource. It could be reasonable to allow multiple registries to\npromote competition for ENUM services. With multiple registries and registrars, the\nmarket formulation for ENUM services could be faster than that of one registry. The\nsuccessful introduction of multiple ENUM registries will minimize any potential\nadministrative bottlenecks and economic benefit can be achieved for the sake of the end\n\n17\n\n\fusers. The value flow among ENUM provisioning players will be same as in the Model 1\nsince the registry service should be transparent to the end users.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\u00fa\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc \u00fa\u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc\n\n.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fb \u00fe \u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nIn this model, the relation and interface between registry and registrar are same as models\nof one registry. However, there should be the mutual connection among registries. For\ninstance, if user A wants to communicate with user B who subscribe to ENUM service\nthrough TSP that is connected to different registry from user A's service, there should be\nclear interaction between different registries. When the user terminates ENUM service or\nchange from old registrar to new one, the designated registry will inform the changed\nfacts to other registries. The interface between TSP/ASP and user is same as in the\nmodel 1.\nPrivacy concerns may lead to vertical integration of registry and registrar functions\namong TSP players. Considering mergers and acquisition in the recent telephony market,\nthis might be one of the most probable scenarios for TSPs in the ENUM registry and\nregistrar service market with this multiple registry model.\nSince TSPs will be in charge of registrar service, most of the ENUM customers of a TSP\nwill be either its own telephone customers or customers who have interest in using e164\nnumber that the TSP manages. Some phone-to-PC calls can be completed by using local\ne164 numbers through appropriate ENUM registration. This motivates both ASPs and\nTSPs to build ENUM enabled services with economic incentives. Different ENUM\nregistries should be able to deal with pointer functions to different e164 provisioning\nENUM numbers assigned to different TSPs. The question here is how we motivate these\ncompeting multiple registries to cooperate each other to share their information to\nseamless ENUM service. Are there any approaches to motivate the registries without\n\n18\n\n\fsegmenting their registrars into TSP's numbering areas? Complete registry service\ncompetition with cooperative resource provisioning may not be easy to achieve when the\nregistrar service is provided by TSPs in this model. One potential solution for this\nproblem would be creating additional value stream from either ASPs or ENUM service\nusers to those registries. However, no such approach has been examined yet.\n4.2.5\n\nModel 5\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc \u00fa\u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd\u00fc\u00fb\u00fa\n\n.\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff\u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fb \u00fe \u00fa\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe \u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nLike the case of model 2, the ASP plays a role as the registrar. The user will subscribe to\nTSP for telephony service and have the assigned telephone number. Those user who\nhave telephone number assigned will get ENUM registrar service from ENUM ASPs\n(who provide ENUM enabled services) and those ASPs will pay the Registry for the\nENUM service provisioning. The interfaces between ASP (or TSP) and user of this\nmodel will be similar to the one of model2.\nIn this model, the role of TSP and its interface to ASP registrar can be integrated with the\nTSP's relationship with the registries. For example, if the Tier 1 registry market is\nsegmented based on the e164 numbering plan areas, the relationship between ASP Tier 2\nand Tier1 registry will be arranged based on the user's e164 number subscription to the\nTSP. Still ASP registrar market can be competitive with ENUM enabled services even\nwith such prearranged provisioning between Tier 1 and Tier2. This implies that all the\nASP registrars need to keep their provisioning relationship with both all the Registries\nand TSPs of their customer. The other scenario can be the introduction of competitive\nregistry market independent from the TSPs and let the ASP registrars to motivate the\nTSPs to cooperate for ENUM provisioning.\n\n19\n\n\fDifferent registries could form separate communities (possibly vertically integrated) with\nASP registrars and TSPs to protect user's privacy ENUM information and handle it\nproperly. Also, it is required to have privacy provisioning between different registry\ncommunities for ENUM registry service in this model.\nThe ASP registrar's choice of registry will be it business and economic decision to\nacquire more customers with better ENUM enabled service. In this competitive registry\nmodel, the ASP registrars would have an incentive to acquire e164 number management\ncapability from the existing TSPs.\n4.2.6\n\nModel 6\n\n\u00ff \u00fe \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc \u00fa\u00ff \u00fb \u00fb\u00fc\u00fa \u00fc\n\u00ff \u00fd \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fa \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc \u00fb\u00fa\n\n.\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00ff \u00fe\u00fd \u00fc\u00fb\n\u00fd\u00fe\u00fc\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fb\u00fc \u00fe \u00fc\u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd \u00fc\n\u00ff\n\u00fb \u00fe \u00fa \u00fc \u00fc\u00fa \u00fe \u00fd\u00fc\n\n\u00fc\u00fe \u00fd \u00fc\n\n\u00fd\u00fc\n\nIn this model 6, the independent registrar resides in Tier 2. The Tier 2 registrars will\ncompete among each other in the domain of price and feature registrar services. Tier 2\nindependent registrars approach for choosing a registry for their service will be based on\nthe service reliability and costs. Many scenarios of Model 6 will be similar to model 5\nexcept that Tier 2 may not need to pursue for the e164 management capability. The\nindependent registrars will eventually promote the competition among TSPs and ASPs\nfor ENUM enabled service market.\nThe user privacy handling approach of this model would be similar to the approach of\nmodel 3 except that privacy provisioning requirements between among different\nregistries. There is little chance of forming rigid separate registry and registrar\ncommunities due to the separated market and lack of economic incentives to do so.\n\n20\n\n\fIn this model, the TSPs and ASPs have incentives to cooperate with Tier 2 registrars and\ntheir registry for their ENUM enabled service markets. The registry service will be\nfinanced by charging the tier 2 independent registrars. The major question of this model\nis that whether there is enough market potential for multiple registries through only\nENUM provisioning registry service. This question might be related to our original\nquestion whether we can number users and service instead of the telephone lines. More\npotential number possible, more likely the multiple-registry model will be successful.\n4.3 Implications of the Models\nIn this section, we will analyze the different ENUM registrar player's strategy on ENUM\nadministration model assuming the IP telephony is the major potential application for\nENUM service.\nFirst, TSPs (both ILECs and CLECs) would be supportive to the models of 1 and 4 where\nthey have registrar presence on ENUM provisioning service domain. Probably, having\nsingle registry will secure their position to manage e164 numbering resources and the\nENUM service provisioning. These models will allow TSPs to better realize the potential\nof the IP telephony market. TSPs would be able to create demand for many enhanced\nservices and broadband access services that TSPs currently provide, and include new\nservices for existing customers. According to Telecom ACT 1996, there would not be\nany firm restriction for TSPs to provide the ENUM registrar service as long as they are in\ncompetitive market in the telephone number domain at least for now. The supporting\nargument for TSPs for this position would be to ensure the integrity, reliability, and\nstability not only of the developing ENUM infrastructure, but also the existing global\ntelephone numbering system. TSPs would like to become a Tier 2 provider to help\nprovide ENUM registration services to interface and update customer records internally\nas their IP telephony service customer profile rather than dealing with other companies to\nprovide the services. However, as other firms try to compete with the TSP in the ENUM\nregistrar market, there will be pressures for open access and provisioning of the e164\nnumber resource. In the long term, that will be major threat to TSPs.\nSecond, ASPs will have incentives to support the Model 5 where multiple registries\nprovide motivations to compete with the cost advantages and enhanced services,\nincluding intelligent query responses to the ENUM database and service-handoffs can be\nbundled with ENUM registrar service. As we mentioned before, the ASPs will try to\nacquire the e164 resource management capability eventually. That will make situations\nwhere ASPs will have difficulties to get the cooperation from the TSPs for existing users\nwith their numbers. Property of phone number needs to be examined in the context of\nENUM registrar policy carefully, and it might be different from the \"1-800\" number\nmodel for \"ownership\" of a number. IP telephony service from these ASP registrars will\ncomplicate the issues of PSTN-IP telephony interconnection and other\ntelecommunications policy.\nFinally, independent registrars will be more supportive for the model 6 where Tier2 can\nfind the economic registry service provider based on their economic decision.\n\n21\n\n\fPotentially, multiple registry model would promote more incentives for TSPs and ASPs\nto cooperate with registrars as long as the TSPs and ASPs are not directly competing with\nindependent registrar in the registrar service market. Vertical integration issue between\nENUM registrar service and ENUM enabled application service (by either TSPs and\nASPs) needs to be examined carefully to avoid any potential market failure in the ENUM\nprovisioning service market. The market opportunity and competition will be enhanced\nif there is a safeguard that ensures ENUM registrar service without vertical integration in\nthe market of IP telephony.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nWith the ENUM protocol still undergoing evaluation, we presented that there will be\nmany opportunities in the IP telephony market. This is largely because ENUM can be\nused with many of the other telecommunications services. In order to gain a considerable\ncustomer base, the industry needs to find ways to lower the costs and promote the service\ndevelopment for the customers. One approach can be bundling the services, however\nthere are issues related to the vertical integration between ENUM provisioning service\nand ENUM enabled application services like IP telephony.\nENUM services have\nnetwork externalities in the IP telephony market. As the numbers of users increase in the\nfuture, additional services can be bundled to make ENUM an interoperable technology.\nWe consider service opportunities and its IP telephony market potential when ENUM\nservice is created and successfully implemented. Without examining exact market and\nindustry analysis, it may become more difficult and complex to set up a proper ENUM\nadministration service model. There might be a great deal of conflicts of interest among\ndifferent ENUM players for new potential market generated by ENUM technology and\nservices. We examined the situations when TSPs, ASPs and independent registrars have\nincentives to provide ENUM registrar services for different market situations.\nRegarding ENUM as service through the converged networking service, there are various\nemerging telecommunications policy issues and problems such as authentication,\nsecurity, privacy, monopolistic infrastructure and so forth.\nHow will ENUM subscriber's privacy be protected? Since ENUM will be designed\nusing the architecture of the global Domain Name Services (DNS), it must be\nacknowledged that current implementation of DNS allows for open access of information\nto any party who requests it. For the Internet to work as smoothly as it does an open\nDNS system is required, but this is quite the contrary with ENUM service. ENUM\nhandles more private information than DNS information. To protect subscriber's\npersonal information it is important that only their service providers have access to it, in\norder to implement such a mechanism ENUM might only contain pointers to a service\ncontext within a tier 2 provider's data store. This will allow the subscriber's information\nto be protected and governed by laws and agencies within their service providers\ngeographic region. This brings about another issue though, what rules and policies should\n\n22\n\n\fgovern personal information where there is no set policies, the answer to this question\nlies within the ENUM industry and public interests.\nPrivacy concerns may lead to vertical integration of the registrar and registry (Tier 1 and\n2) functions. A service provider who wanted to guarantee greater security might choose\nnot to run a registry open to all registrars, but limit access to its own or to specially\napproved registrars.\nWhen attempting to guarantee consumer protection we must address the issues of\nauthentication and validation. It is imperative that when allowing an end-user to populate\ntheir ENUM information that we guarantee they are the subscriber and not someone who\nis trying to hijack a number. If service providers cannot guarantee a subscriber's ENUM\nintegrity, ENUM will be a failure. Security must be guaranteed both within the system\nand in end to end connections. To do this we must establish policies for authenticating\nend-users.\nThe model for Tier 1 registry market should be considered carefully. As we discussed\npreviously, the model (single, multiple and competitive multiple) of Tier 1 would have\nimportant effects to the operation of ENUM service market and provisioning operation.\nIt might be important to diagnose the potential public interests related ENUM registry\nservice.\nIt is related to the telephone numbering services that the FCC might have the question of\nregulation or unregulation of the PSTN to DNS based ENUM service. The issue of\nconcern to establish regulation might be closely related to the measures of public\ninterests. Will the Commission regulate the ENUM registrars and registries and decide\nwho the providers will be? Will it decide to allow TSPs to provide the ENUM service to\nconsumers? Presently, the FCC has no legal basis to undertake any action in regards to\nregulating the ENUM service and IP telephony. [Cannon, 2001] [Frieden, 1997]\nHowever, FCC needs to watch for possible monopolistic behaviors once the market takes\noff.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 presents a legal basis for individuals to enter into\nthe business of communications. It also allows for competition in any market against\nothers and it's intent is to reduce regulation. Sec 253 \u2013 Removal of Barriers to Entry \u2013\nstates that no restriction should be placed on entities (companies, individuals) trying to\nenter the market. This section of the Act provides for the unregulation of the tier level\nentries. Therefore, regulating the ENUM will be premature and may not be feasible right\nnow. FCC's role as an ENUM representative member to the ITU-T presents an\nadvantage as guidelines and policies continue to be developed. However, it is\nquestionable whether we need a coordination body like ICANN for ENUM resources if\nthere is enough interest from the public. This suggests that the regulatory issues raised by\nENUM will not go away, and that regulators will have to continue to confront them as the\nmarket evolves.\n\n23\n\n\fIn summary, we consider the following as our major interests in new ENUM services:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe potential of ENUM to create new IP telephony service market,\nAdministrative models of ENUM-based service (i.e., market organization) are\nanalyzed based on the different players' incentives and motivations for market\npotential,\nThe key policy implications of ENUM services are analyzed from the standpoint\nof the administrative model analysis, and\nOther regulatory policy issues are examined in the general context of ENUM\nissues.\n\nReferences\n[AT&T, 2001] AT&T, NeuStar, \"ENUM Administration Process\" Feb. 9, 2001\n[Brown, 2001] A.
