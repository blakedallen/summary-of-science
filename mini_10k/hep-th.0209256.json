In\nparticular, we consider amplitudes for exclusive scattering of hadrons at large momentum transfer,\nhadronic form factors and distribution functions.\nPACS : 11.25.Pm, 12.38.Bx\nKeywords: string theory, warped geometry, hadronic processes\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs it is well-known, string theory (dual-resonance model) was originally invented to describe the\nphysics of hadrons [1]. However, in spite of much effort this idealized theory of hadrons failed and\nfinally it was replaced by QCD.\nNew ideas came in 1997-99; with Polyakov proposal for string theory whose tension is running,\nMaldacena conjecture of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and the Randall-Sundrum proposal for the\nhierarchy problem [2, 3, 4]. The key feature of all these is the warped geometry in spacetime, i.e.,\nspacetime metric is no longer Minkowskian rather the normalization of the four-dimensional Minkowski\nmetric is a function of other coordinates. In the simplest case, for example, the worldsheet action (its\nbosonic part) for the theory with the running tension has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n2\n2\n \u0304\n \u0304\nd z \u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6 + a (\u03c6) \u2202X * \u2202X\n,\n(1.1)\nS=\n4\u03c0\nwhere a2 (\u03c6) is the running string tension. A natural requirement is that a(\u03c6) \u223c e\u03c6 as \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e. In\nother words, spacetime behaves for large \u03c6 as AdS5 . The field \u03c6 was called in [2] as the Liouville field.\nUsing these ideas, Polchinski and Strassler recently initiated a new attempt to describe the physics\nof hadrons in the framework of string theory [5] 1 . They proposed a scheme of evaluating high-energy\nscattering amplitudes of glueballs in terms of vertex operators and found that the amplitudes fall as\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: andreev@physik.hu-berlin.de\nPermanent address: Landau Institute, Moscow, Russia\n1\nSee also [6, 7, 8].\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fpowers of momentum. This is the desired result which was found in the physics of hadrons long time\nago [9]. To be more precise, the amplitude for exclusive scattering of m + 2 glueballs is given by [5]\n(gNc )(n\u22122)/4\nM(2 \u2192 m) \u223c\nNcm \u039bm\u22122\n\n\u0012 \u0013n\u22124\n\u039b\np\n\n,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere p is a large momentum scale, g is the string coupling constant which is a square of the gauge\ncoupling, Nc is a number of colors, and \u039b is a scale by the lightest glueball. n denotes a total number\nof constituents in the glueballs.\nIn fact, it was known already in the seventies that dimensional analysis and some simple assumptions (dimensional counting rules) immediately lead to the correct scaling in exclusive hadronic\nscattering at large momentum transfer 2\nM(2 \u2192 m) \u223c p\u2212n+4\n\n.\n\n(1.3)\n\nIndeed, if the total number of constituents in the hadrons is n and one-particle state |pi is normalized\nin such a way to be dimension of [length], then the amplitude has dimension [length]n\u22124 . If, moreover,\nat large momentum transfer, p is the only length scale, then it immediately follows the wanted scaling.\nModulo soft violations (logarithms) this scaling is in rather good agreement with experimental results.\nIt is now clear that the result (1.2) doesn't completely agree with this dimensional analysis of\nexclusive processes because it contains two dimensionfull parameters. It seems more relevant for\ninclusive processes where the second parameter is normally interpreted as the missing mass. In this\ncase n represents a subset of constituents which participate in scattering; others remains \"spectators\".\nMoreover, in section 2 we will also see that QCD analysis provides a dependence on the coupling\nconstant which differs from the one of Eq.(1.2).\nThe purpose of the present paper is twofold. The first is to propose a possible scheme for getting\nthe scaling within string theory which resolves these difficulties. This scheme can be considered as a\nrefinement of [5]. Like old matrix models (2d gravity coupled to conformal matter), where the scaling\nis obtained via a zero mode of the Liouville field [11], here we also get the scaling by a zero mode.\nAs early mentioned, the warped geometry provides a natural candidate for a role of the Liouville\nfield. Note that this significantly simplifies the analysis as a knowledge of the whole dependence of\nvertex operators on the Liouville field is not required. As to the zero mode dependence, it is provided\nby the corresponding Laplace equation in spacetime. Thus our derivation of the scaling seems quite\nuniversal. The second is to apply this scheme to hadronic form factors and distribution functions for\ndeep inelastic scattering. There are some special limits where these objects can easily be analyzed\n[12, 13]. So we are bound to learn something if we succeed.\nIt is also worth mentioning that while this paper was being written, Polchinski and Strassler came\nup with a new paper [14] 3 which has some overlap with what we describe in sections 2 and 3.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. We start in section 2 by recalling some basic facts on QCD\nanalysis of large-momentum-transfer processes. Here we focus on hard subprocesses for hadronic\nscattering and form factors. In Section 3 we present the scheme for getting the scaling behavior\nwithin string theory. We find complete agreement with the Born approximation in QCD. Section 4\ncontains our conclusions and a list of open problems.\n2\n3\n\nSee, e.g., [10].\nSee also [15].\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nLarge-momentum-transfer processes in QCD\n\nIn this section we will briefly recall some basic facts on QCD analysis of large-momentum-transfer\nexclusive processes 4 . We will not consider spin dependent effects in what follows.\n\n2.1\n\nFixed-angle hadronic scattering\n\nIn QCD analysis of a hadronic process AB \u2192 CD the fixed-angle scattering amplitude related to hard\nsubprocesses is given by the amplitude TH for the scattering of hadronic constituents, integrated over\npossible constituent momenta adding up to the hadron momenta. Explicitly,\nY Z 1\n[dxi ] \u03a6\u2217D (xD , p2\u22a5 )\u03a6\u2217C (xC , p2\u22a5 )TH (xA , . . . , xD , p2\u22a5 )\u03a6B (xB , p2\u22a5 )\u03a6A (xA , p2\u22a5 ) ,\nM(AB \u2192 CD) =\ni=A,...,D\n\n0\n\n(2.1)\nPn i i \u0001 2\nxk , p\u22a5 = tu/s, and ni is a minimal number\nwhere xi = {xi1 , . . . , xini }, [dxi ] = dxi1 . . . dxini \u03b4 1 \u2212 k=1\nof constituents (valence quarks) in the i-th hadron 5 . The momentum transfer between hadronic\nconstituents occurs via the hard scattering amplitude TH which, to leading order in the coupling\nconstant, is given by the sum of all Born diagrams with hadrons replaced by their constituents. A\ntypical Born diagram looks like that in Fig.1. The amplitude \u03a6i is a probability amplitude for finding\nconstituents with fractions of longitudinal momenta xik in the i-th hadron.\n\nFigure 1: A typical Born diagram for meson-baryon scattering.\nFor s \u2192 \u221e at s/t fixed, TH falls with increasing s as\nA\n\nTH (x , . . . , x\n\nD\n\n, p2\u22a5 )\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ne2\n4\u03c0s\n\n\u0013 n \u22122\n2\n\n6\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nf (s/t, xA , . . . , xD ) 1 + O(e2 )\n,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere n = nA + * * * + nD . Since the probability amplitudes in the Born approximation behave as\n\u03a6i (xi , p2\u22a5 ) = \u03c6i (xi ) ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nthe amplitude M(AB \u2192 CD) takes the form\nM(AB \u2192 CD) \u223c\n4\n\n\u0012\n\ne2\n4\u03c0s\n\n\u0013 n \u22122\n2\n\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor further discussion, backgrounds and experimental data see, e.g., [16, 17].\nNote that adding more constituents (nonvalence quarks) is unimportant to leading order in p2\u22a5 at p2\u22a5 \u2192 \u221e. So, ni\nevery time means a minimal number.\n6\nNote that in the center of mass frame, t = \u2212s sin2 \u03b82 , u = \u2212s cos2 2\u03b8 , and p2\u22a5 = 14 s sin2 \u03b8. So, p2\u22a5 \u223c s at fixed angle.\n5\n\n3\n\n\fAt this point a comment is in order. It is well-known that radiative corrections in QCD typically\ncontain logarithms that violates the scaling. To next order (one-loop approximation), they are in\u0001\u2212\u03b3i\ncluded by replacing e2 /4\u03c0 \u2192 \u03b1s (p2\u22a5 ), \u03a6i (xi , p2\u22a5 ) \u2192 \u03c6i (xi ) ln p2\u22a5 /\u039b2QCD\n, where \u039bQCD is the QCD\nparameter and \u03b3i is some constant. Note that the amplitude can then be rewritten as\n\u0003 n \u22122+P i \u03b3i \u2212n+4\n\u0002\nM(AB \u2192 CD) \u223c \u03b1s (p2\u22a5 ) 2\np\u22a5\n\n2.2\n\n.\n\n(2.5)\n\nElectromagnetic form factors and structure functions\n\nThe electromagnetic form factor of a hadron is given by a matrix element of the electromagnetic\ncurrent between two hadronic states hp + q|J a (0)|pi. The form factors are most easily analyzed by\nusing the two invariants q 2 = \u2212Q2 < 0, \u03bdB = p * q and then taking the Bjorken limit where Q2 and\n\u03bdB both go to infinity with the ratio, xB = Q2 /2\u03bdB fixed [12]. xB is known as the Bjorken variable.\nNote that for elastic scattering xB = 1. Using Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance, the matrix\nelement can be parameterized in terms of a scalar function (form factor) F (Q2 ) as\nhp + q|J \u03bc (0)|pi = (2p\u03bc + q \u03bc )F (Q2 ) ,\nwhere J \u03bc (0) = d4 k J \u03bc (k).\nTo leading order in the coupling constant, the form factor in QCD takes the form\nZ 1\n2\n[dx][dy] \u03a6\u2217 (x, Q2 ) TB (x, y, Q2 ) \u03a6(y, Q2 ) ,\nF (Q ) =\n\n(2.6)\n\nR\n\n(2.7)\n\n0\n\nP\nwhere x = {x1 , . . . , xn }, [dx] = dx1 . . . dxn \u03b4 (1 \u2212 nk=1 xk ), and n is a number of constituents (valence\nquarks) in the hadron 7 . The amplitude \u03a6 is defined in the same way as in the previous subsection\nwhile TB is now given by the sum of all Born diagrams for the hadron constituents to scatter with the\nphoton producing the constituents in the final state. A typical Born diagram now looks like that in\nFig.2.\n\nFigure 2: A typical Born diagram for the meson form factor.\nAt large Q2 the Born diagrams give\n2\n\nTB (x, y, Q ) =\n\n\u0012\n\ne2\n4\u03c0Q2\n\n\u0013n\u22121\n\ntB (x, y)\n\n(2.8)\n\nand thus, reasoning as in the previous subsection, the asymptotic behavior of the form factor is given\nby\n\u0012 2 \u0013n\u22121\ne\n2\n,\n(2.9)\nF (Q ) \u223c\n4\u03c0Q2\n7\n\nThe variable y and the integration measure [dy] are defined in the same way.\n\n4\n\n\fA few noteworthy facts are the following. Dimensional analysis and the assumptions of section\n1 which lead to the scaling law for the amplitudes can also be applied to the form factors. This\nimmediately gives the desired scaling law (Bjorken scaling) F (Q2 ) \u223c Q\u22122n+2 . One of the most\ninteresting applications of QCD was the prediction of slow violations of Bjorken scaling by soft ln Q2 's.\nTo one-loop approximation, the logarithms are included in\u0001the same way as in subsection 2.1: by\n\u2212\u03b3i\n.

In particular,\nit is expressed in terms of the distribution functions Gi as 9\nF2 (xB ) = xB\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bb2i Gi (xB )\n\n,\n\n(2.13)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03bbi is a charge of the i-th constituent.\nThe structure functions are not known completely because they are in general beyond the tools of\nperturbative theory. However, some asymptotics are avaliable. In particular, the distribution functions\nwhich become functions (modulo soft logarithms) only of xB in the Bjorken limit, behave as [13]\nGi (xB ) \u223c (1 \u2212 xB )2n\u22123\n\n(2.14)\n\nnear the threshold xB = 1. As before, n means a total number of constituents in the hadron. It is\nworth mentioning that this asymptotic behavior can also be determined via a convolution equation\nfor Gi [18].\n\n3\n\nScaling laws via string theory\n\nThe aim of this section is to show how the Born approximation for hadronic amplitudes and form\nfactors can be easily obtained in the framework of string theory.\nSince we don't consider spin effects, we omit an antisymmetric part of W \u03bc\u03bd which provides two other structure\nfunctions: g1 and g2 .\n9\nGi (xB ) is defined as a probability of finding the i-th constituent in the hadron with fractional longitudinal momentum\nxB (in the infinite momentum frame of the hadron).\n8\n\n5\n\n\f3.1\n\nString theory settings\n\nAccording to our discussion of section 1, the metric asymptotically behaves as AdS5 . Since we are\ninterested in the scaling rather than its violation, it is natural to use this metric. So, as in [5] we begin\nwith string theory on the product of AdS5 with a five-dimensional transverse space K. A spacetime\nmetric is then\nr2\nR2\nds2 = 2 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dX \u03bc dX \u03bd + 2 dr 2 + R2 ds2K ,\n(3.1)\nR\nr\nwhere R is a radius of AdS5 , \u03b7 is a four-dimensional Minkowski metric. We assume that K doesn't\nprovide any dimensionfull parameter except R. Moreover, ds2K doesn't depend on R.\nBefore continuing our discussion of string theory settings, let us pause here to stress an important\npoint. Although we use some technique inspired by the AdS/CFT conjecture, we don't strictly follow\nthis conjecture. The point is that we are interested in the physical processes where perturbation theory\nis applicable rather than the strong coupling regime. So, we postulate the following relation\ng=\n\nR2\ne2\n= \u2032\n4\u03c0\n\u03b1\n\n(3.2)\n\nbetween the closed string coupling constant g, the gauge coupling constant e, and the parameters R,\n\u03b1\u2032 . This relation is not obviously what is imposed by the AdS/CFT correspondence. It becomes the\n\u221a\nlatter (modulo a numerical factor) by replacing e2 \u2192 e, g \u2192 g. It is worth mentioning that some\nexamples where AdS/CFT results look like QCD ones after the above replacement are already known\nin the literature (see, e.g., [19, 20]).\nIn the first-quantized string theory one first introduces a free field action on a worldsheet, then\ndefines physical vertex operators. Finally, scattering amplitudes in spacetime are defined as expectation values of the vertex operators. In general, it is unknown how to implement this program in the\ncase of curved background like AdS. However, we think that the problem of interest doesn't require\nknowledge of the full string theory on AdS. It should be a simple stringy analog of the dimensional\ncounting rules which results in the scaling laws. Our idea is to relate the scaling to a zero mode of r as\nit is usually done in the context of 2d gravity where the scaling is due to a zero mode of the Liouville\nfield. Then, all what we need is the dependence of vertex operators on this zero mode. The latter can\nbe found from the Laplace equation on AdS5 \u00d7 K. In fact, our scenario means that non-zero modes of\nthe transverse fields as well as r are not of primary importance for the scaling. To leading order, they\ncontribute a numerical factor. Alternatively, one can say that fluctuations of the transverse fields as\nwell as r are slow as it was done in [5].\nUnder this assumption, it is straightforward to write down a part of the worldsheet action for the\nremaining non-zero modes which is most appropriate for our purposes 10\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n \u0304 + \u03c8 * \u2202\u03c8\n \u0304 + \u03c8\u0304 * \u2202 \u03c8\u0304\n\u2202X * \u2202X\n,\n(3.3)\nd2 z\nS=\n4\u03c0\n\u03b1\u0302\n2\n\nwhere \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1\u2032 Rr2 and the \u03c8's have been rescaled as \u03c8 \u2192 Rr \u03c8. We use this form of the action for two\nreasons: (1) It allows us to use the known results for string amplitudes simply by replacing \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 \u03b1\u0302.\n(2) It represents a model theory which has the running tension in the sense of Polyakov (see Eq.(1.1)).\nTo evaluate the correlation functions of vertex operators one needs to define the path integral\n\u221a\nmeasure. First let us do so for the zero modes 11 . It is natural to take it in a covariant form \u2212g d10 \u03be.\n10\n\n11\n\nNote that this is a conformal invariant action because r doesn't depend on z.\nWe only consider the NS-NS sector, so there are no zero modes of the \u03c8's.\n\n6\n\n\fHowever, for a reason which will be clear in a moment we need it to be dimensionless. So, we define\nthe measure as\n1 \u221a\n1\n\u2212g d10 \u03be = \u20322 4 r 3 dr d4 x d\u03a9K ,\n(3.4)\n\u20322\n6\n\u03b1 R\n\u03b1 R\nwhere d\u03a9K is an invariant measure on K.\nThe non-zero modes are quantized in an ordinary way as it follows from their action (3.3).The\nonly novelty is an appearance of \u03b1\u0302 instead of \u03b1\u2032 . For example, in the case of spherical topology the\npropagators are given by\nhX \u03bc (z, z\u0304)X \u03bd (z \u2032 , z\u0304 \u2032 )i = \u2212\u03b1\u0302 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd ln |z \u2212 z \u2032 | ,\n\nh\u03c8 \u03bc (z)\u03c8 \u03bd (z \u2032 )i =\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n\n.\n\n(3.5)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we are interested in the scaling properties of hadron interaction involving\ntransfer of large momenta where all masses are negligible. Therefore the most appropriate string\nvertex operators to try are the massless ones. In general, one computes such vertex operators in\nthe supergravity approximation (zero mode approximation) by finding solutions of the corresponding\nLaplace equation on AdS5 \u00d7 K. A general solution looks like V \u223c f (\u03a9)\u03c6(r)eip*x , where \u03c6 shows a\npower-law falloff as r \u2192 \u221e. As mentioned earlier, the metric is AdS5 only for large r, so it is pointless\nto use the exact solution for \u03c6(r) as long as we use the AdS5 metric. The only thing we really need is\nits power-law falloff \u03c6 \u223c r \u2212n . It was suggested in [5] that if one interprets vertex operators as hadronic\nstates, one thinks of the n's as the numbers of hadron constituents. The function f is a solution of\nthe Laplace equation on K which is responsible for internal degrees of freedom. Since we don't take\nthem into account, we will not pay attention to f as well.\nNow let us extend the analysis to include the non-zero modes. In the approximation we work it\ncan easily be done by using the standard expressions for the vertex operators with \u03b1\u2032 replaced by \u03b1\u0302.\nPutting all this together, we get\nZ\n\u2212n ip*x\nVn, p = f (\u03a9) r e\n(3.6)\nd2 z \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd Vi\u03bc (p, z)V\u0304i\u03bd (p, z\u0304) ,\nwhere i means the superghost charge, \u03b5 is the polarization tensor. Note that we extract the zero-mode\nfactor eip*x from the vertex operators Vi and V\u0304i here and below. In general, the integrand of (3.6) is\nmore involved because Vi and V\u0304i are dressed by operators constructed from non-zero modes of r and\nthe transverse fields.\nSince we don't consider spin dependent effects\nlet us specialize to the dilaton vertex. To fix its\n\u221a\nnormalization, we first make a rescaling X \u2192 \u03b1\u0302X to bring the integrand into a dimensionless form.\nThen we insert a factor \u03b1\u2032n . Thus, the vertex takes the form\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013n\nZ\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\nip*x\n\u03bd\nVn, p = f (\u03a9)\ne\nd2 z \u03b5dil\n(3.7)\n\u03bc\u03bd Vi (p\u0302, z)V\u0304i (p\u0302, z\u0304) .\nr\n\u221a\nWe use p\u0302 as a shorthand notation for \u03b1\u0302 p. It is evident that such a vertex has dimension [length]n\nexactly as needed for the normalization of n-particle state.\nNow that we have the vertex operators for hadronic states, we can focus on the next object of\ninterest, the vertex operator for the electromagnetic current. Since the current is conserved, it obeys\nq * J(q) = 0 .\n\n7\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fA natural realization which satisfies such a condition can easily be found in a picture where a string\nworldsheet admits boundaries 12 . In this case, we have\nI\n\u03bc\niq*x\nJ (q) \u223c e\ndz V0\u03bc (q\u0302, z) ,\n(3.9)\nC\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\nwhere V0\u03bc = \u2202X \u03bc + 2i (q\u0302 * \u03c8)\u03c8 \u03bc eiq\u0302*X , q\u0302 = \u03b1\u0302 q. C denotes a worldsheet boundary.\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011n\nBy analogy with the vertex operators of hadrons, we insert the factor f (\u03a9) \u03b1r . Since the current\nhas the dimensionality of [length], we set n = 1. Thus, a final form of J \u03bc (q) is given by\nI\n\u03b1\u2032 ip*x\n\u03bc\nJ (q) = f (\u03a9) e\ndz V0\u03bc (q\u0302, z) .\n(3.10)\nr\nC\n\u0010\n\n3.2\n\nEvaluation of amplitudes\n\nThe calculation of the scattering amplitude for a hadronic process AB \u2192 CD is mainly going along\nthe lines of [5] adjusted to our settings. The amplitude is defined as the expectation value of the\nproduct of the vertex operators (3.7)\n\u03b4(4) (pA + * * * + pD ) M(AB \u2192 CD) =\n\n1\nh\ng2\n\nY\n\ni=A,...,D\n\ngni Vni ,pi i .\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere the string worldsheet is a sphere as is usual at tree level in closed string perturbation theory.\nSome factors of this expression require further explanation: (1) The over-all factor g\u22122 comes from\nthe sphere as it should be. (2) The factors gni are due to our normalization prescription. It differs\nfrom the standard one and will be discussed later.\nThe integration over non-zero modes doesn't require much of work at least in the case of spherical\ntopology where the four-point dilaton amplitude A4 is well-known in the literature [21]. Aside from\nan irrelevant numerical factor, the amplitude is then given by\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013n\nZ \u221e\ngn\u22122\n3 \u03b1\nA4 (\u03b1\u2032 R2 s/r 2 , \u03b1\u2032 R2 t/r 2 , \u03b1\u2032 R2 u/r 2 ) .\n(3.12)\ndr r\nM(AB \u2192 CD) = \u20322 4\n\u03b1 R 0\nr\nHere the integral over \u03a9K has not disappeared, but was included in the numerical\n\u221a factor. n is the sum\nof the ni 's. From the above expression it is evident that if we rescaled r as r \u2192 \u03b1\u2032 sR r, then we get\n\u0010 g \u0011 n \u22122\n2\nM(AB \u2192 CD) = F (\u03b8)\ns\n\n,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere F (\u03b8) is a function of the angle \u03b8 defined in the center of mass frame. This is the desired result,\nand it is identical to the result of QCD, Eq.(2.4).\nA couple of comments is in order:\n(1) The use of the relation (3.2) is crucial for matching with the QCD result.\n(2) It may appear that the scaling is due to the zero modes only. That is not exactly true. The\nnone-zero modes contribute into the function F (\u03b8) which contains some important information. We\nwill return to this issue in section 4.\n12\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the simplest way of introducing electromagnetic currents in string theory.\n\n8\n\n\f3.3\n\nEvaluation of form factors and distribution functions\n\nBy analogy with the amplitudes, we define the form factor as the expectation value of the product of\nthe vertex operators given by (3.7) and (3.10). Explicitly,\nZ\n1\n\u221a\n\u03bc\nhp + q| J (0) |pi = d4 k h gn Vn,p+q gJ \u03bc (k) g n Vn,p i .\n(3.14)\ng\nThe worldsheet is now a disk (upper half plane). So we insert the over-all factor g\u22121 as is usual in\nthe case of the disk. Just as before, each closed string vertex carries a factor gn . From this, it seems\nnatural to accompany each open string vertex with g n/2 . If so, then J \u03bc is accompanied by g1/2 .\nTo evaluate the right hand side of Eq.(3.14), it is convenient to use the worldsheet doubling trick\n(see, e.g.,[22] and references therein). After performing the integration over x and setting the vertex\noperators at (z1 , z\u03041 , z2 , z3 , z\u03043 ) = (iy, \u2212iy, t, i, \u2212i), we find (modulo a numerical factor)\n1\n\ng2n\u2212 2\nhp + q| J (0) |pi = \u20322 4\n\u03b1 R\n\u03bc\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\ndr r\n0\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1\u2032\nr\n\n\u00132n+1\n\nA\u03bc (p\u0302, q\u0302) ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwith\n\u03bc\n\nA (p\u0302, q\u0302) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u03b7\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bb\n\u03c3\ndil\ndy \u03b5dil\n\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03c3 h V\u22121 (iy, \u2212p\u0302 \u2212 q\u0302) V\u22121 (\u2212iy, \u2212p\u0302 \u2212 q\u0302) V0 (t, 2q\u0302) V0 (i, p\u0302) V0 (\u2212i, p\u0302) i\n\n.\n\n(3.16)\nHere we again include the integral over \u03a9K into an irrelevant numerical factor.\nTo keep things as simple as possible, first we choose the infinite momentum frame for the hadron\n13\n\np\u03bc = P + M 2 /2P, 0, 0, P\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\ndr r 3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0001\nq \u03bc = \u03bdB /P, q 1 , q 2 , 0\n\n.\n\n(3.17)\n\nHere M 2 is a mass of the hadron. Secondly, we specialize in a convenient\u221acurrent component J 0 or,\nequivalently, J 3 . Then, it follows from Lorentz covariance that A0 (p\u0302, q\u0302) = \u03b1\u0302P A(\u03b1\u0302Q2 ).\nUsing Eq.(2.6), we find the following representation for the form factor\n1\n\nF (Q2 ) =\n\ng2n\u2212 2\n5\n\n\u03b1\u2032 2 R3\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u03b1\u2032\nr\n\n\u00132n+2\n\nA(\u03b1\u2032 R2 Q2 /r 2 ) .\n\n(3.18)\n\np\nThe desired QCD result (2.9) is obtained by rescaling r \u2192 \u03b1\u2032 Q2 Rr and using the relation (3.2).\nAt this point, it is necessary to make a couple of remarks.\n(1) Unlike the four-point dilaton amplitude A4 we used to evaluate the hadronic amplitudes in the\nprevious subsection, the correlator of the five vertex operators\nin Eq.(3.16) is not well-defined in the\nR\nfollowing sense. As an object of 2d conformal field theory, dt V0\u03bc (t, 2q\u0302) is well-defined only at q 2 = 0\nwhile for our purposes we need it at large q 2 . In fact, this is the old standing problem of string\ntheory: how to continue correlators of vertex operators defined on-shell (at special values of momenta)\nto off-shell (for arbitrary values of momenta). So far, there is no solution to this problem. In the\nproblem of interest it means that A0 is in general ambiguous 14 . However, it is clear from the above\ndiscussion that the explicit form of A0 is not of principal importance for our purposes. So, our results\nseem rather universal and independent of a special way of going off-shell. We will return to this point\n13\n\nNote that Q2 = \u2212q 2 = (q 1 )2 + (q 2 )2 + O(1/P 2 ).\nBecause of this, it seems pointless to give an explicit calculation of A0 . It will suffer from ambiguity as any off-shell\ncontinuation.\n14\n\n9\n\n\fin Section 4.\n(2) It is straightforward to evaluate the inelastic form factors by using the same technique. It is clear\nthat the result has the same form as before with n replaced to (n1 + n2 )/2. Here ni means a number\nof constituents in the i-th hadron.\nFinally, let us discuss how the asymptotics (2.14) for the distribution functions can be obtained in\nstring theory. In fact, it was realized long years ago [13] that this asymptotics is closely related to the\nasymptotic behavior of the form factors we have just considered. Thus, it seems natural to reproduce\nit too.\nTo do so, we first choose a convenient infinite momentum frame defined by Eq.(3.17). Our next\ntask is to evaluate a probability amplitude of finding the i-th constituent in the hadron with fractional\nlongitudinal momentum xB . If Vn,p describes a hadronic state with n constituents, then the best what\nwe can use as an approximation to the hadronic state containing the i-th constituent with a specific\nmomentum is V1,p\u2032 Vn\u22121,p\u2212p\u2032 . What is important to remark is that unlike p, all other momenta are not\nlight-like. Thus, the corresponding vertex operators are off-shell. The probability amplitude is simply\nAi \u223c h Vn,p V1,p\u2032 Vn\u22121,p\u2212p\u2032 i .\n\n(3.19)\n\nTo compute the distribution function, we have to integrate |Ai |2 over momenta of the constituents.\nIn our approximation to the probability amplitude there is no integration over longitudinal momenta\nas xB is fixed. As to transverse momenta, it seems natural to parameterize them in terms of q (see\n(3.17)). The lovely thing about the threshold xB = 1 is that at leading order in 1 \u2212 xB we can take\nq = p \u2212 p\u2032 . Just as before, it is now easy to evaluate the scaling behavior of the amplitude\nAi \u223c\n\n1\n(Q2 )n\u22122\n\n.\n\nFinally, the desired result is obtained after a simple estimation\nZ +\u221e\ndQ2 A2i \u223c (1 \u2212 xB )2n\u22123\nGi (xB ) \u223c\n2\nM\n1\u2212xB\n\n(3.20)\n\n.\n\n(3.21)\n\nAt this point, it is worth mentioning that in approaching the threshold one must satisfy the inequality\nQ2 (1 \u2212 xB ) > M 2 in order to stay in the Bjorken limiting region for xB . This inequality provides the\nlower limit of integration.\n\n4\n\nMany open problems\n\nThere is a large number of open problems associated with the circle of ideas explored in this paper.\nIn this section we list a few.\nIt would be interesting to understand in more detail how string theory reproduces the results of\nQCD in the Born approximation. The point is that in QCD the calculation of the hadronic scattering\namplitudes involves a summation of a huge number of Born diagrams like the one presented in Fig.1.\nOn the other hand, we saw in section 3 that in string theory the summation is automatically done and\nall information is encoded in the function F (\u03b8). Thus, this function may be considered as a generating\nfunction for Born diagrams. If so, it would significantly simplify ordinary QCD calculations. The\nproblem is how to implement this explicitly. Unfortunately, our approximation is invalid for computing\nthe exact form of F (\u03b8). A possible way to deal with the problem is of course to involve the non-zero\n10\n\n\fmodes of r and even the transverse fields. A price for this is a long standing problem: string theory\non AdS5 . Though some information which is relevant for deep inelastic scattering has already been\nextracted from this theory (see, e.g., [7, 23]), a complete solution is still missing.\nA related problem is understanding more clearly the stringy calculation of the form factors. Even\nwithout turning on the non-zero modes of r and the transverse fields, it requires off-shell continuation.\nIn principle, accounting for the non-zero modes might help with off-shell continuation. However,\nanother interesting idea for doing so is to try the original Liouville mode as it comes from a conformal\nfactor of the worldsheet metric [24]. In addition, it would be interesting to compute the matrix element\nhp|J \u03bc (\u03be)J \u03bd (0)|pi directly by using the vertex operators.\nIt should be stressed that the string theory construction we are dealing with has an essential\ndifference from the standard one. Usually each external leg of Feynman diagram corresponds to a\nvertex operator in the corresponding string correlator representing the amplitude. For example, one\nhas at tree level in closed string perturbation theory\ng m\u22122 h Vn1 ,p1 . . . Vnm ,pm i ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere each operator is accompanied by g. It is transparent from the diagrams of Figs.1-2 that in\nthe problem of interest we assigned a vertex operator also to a bunch of external legs. This is as it\nshould be because hadrons are composite objects. As a consequence, our normalization prescription\nfor the vertex operators is different of (4.1). It is clear that the standard prescription fails if it is\nblindly applied to recover the QCD results. To see what happened, consider our normalization in\nmore detail. We begin with a modification of (4.1) via replacing g Vni ,pi \u2192 g ni Vni ,pi . This gives the\nover-all factor g n\u22122 , where n = n1 + * * * + nm . However, this is not the whole story. The point is\nthat the expectation value of the product of the vertex operators provides an additional factor g\u2212n/2 .\nThis effect is unknown in the case of Minkowski spacetime because it is due to the warped geometry.\nThus, we end up with the desired answer. Modulo g \u22122 , the effect of the warped geometry is in fact the\n\u221a\ntransformation of the closed string coupling constant into the open string coupling constant g \u2192 g.\nIt would be interesting to see whether the warped geometry also transforms\nthe open string coupling e\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\nto e. If so, then it might help to explain the known effect e Nc \u2192 e Nc observed in the AdS/CFT\ncalculations (see, e.g., [19, 20]).\nAnother interesting problem involves computing the quantum corrections. Our discussion here was\nentirely classical. At first glance, the QCD results of section 2 formally assume a slight modification\nof the Born approximation at one-loop level that on the string theory side can be implemented by just\nreplacing gni \u2192 gni +\u03b3i . But a real situation is much more involved. The point is that the coupling\nconstant is now running. So, if we indeed wish to recover the QCD results, we need to provide a\nmechanism which makes the coupling running. One possible way is to deform the string background\nto get the desired running. How to implement this and what will happen remains to be seen.\nAs we mentioned, we don't strictly follow the prescriptions of the AdS/CFT correspondence. So,\nwe have postulated the relation (3.2). Our motivation is that first of all we would try to describe\nthe known results of QCD to see whether the ideas work or not. Note also that, one can exploit this\nrelation to make a simple estimation how large is the internal compact space K in terms of \u03b1\u2032\nR2 = 0.1 \u03b1\u2032\n\n.\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere we used the fact that a typical value of the coupling constant obtained from deep inelastic\nscattering experiments is of order 0.1. Next step would be to see what happens in the strong coupling\nregime where it is believed that the AdS/CFT correspondence holds. At present we lack the solution\n11\n\n\fof string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 or on its nonconformal deformations that could help us. However,\nlet us nonetheless see what information about high-energy scattering can be found by using our\napproximation. Assuming as in [5] that at small r the geometry given by (3.1) is truncated at r = r0 ,\nthe amplitude (3.12) then becomes\n3\n\nM(AB \u2192 CD) \u223c\n\ng 4 n\u22122\nn\n4\n\nNc\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u221a\ns\n\n\u0013n\u22124 Z\n\n\u221e\n\ndr r\n\u221a\nr0 / \u03b1\u2032 sR\n\n3\u2212n\n\nA4\n\n\u00101\nsin2 \u03b8/2 cos2 \u03b8/2 \u0011\n,\n\u2212\n,\u2212\n,\nr2\nr2\nr2\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u221a\nwhere we also rescaled \u221a\nr as r \u2192 \u03b1\u2032 sRr. It is at least somewhat plausible in the hard scattering\nlimit (s \u2192 \u221e) that r0 / \u03b1\u2032 sR \u226a 1 15 . If so, then the leading behavior of the amplitude is the same\npower-law falloff as in [5] 16 . It is of some interest to evaluate corrections to the scaling. To do so,\n1\nfirst we note that at small r the four-point amplitude A4 behaves as A4 \u223c e\u2212 r2 f (\u03b8) . Next we estimate\nthe correction as\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\nZ\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\n\u2212\u03b1 R\nsf (\u03b8)\n1\ng 4 n\u22122 1 n\u22124 r0 / \u03b1 sR\n3\u2212n \u2212 r 2 f (\u03b8)\nr2\n0\n\u221a\n\u223c\ne\n.\n(4.4)\ndr\nr\ne\nn\ns\n0\nNc4\nUnlike in section 2, where the radiative QCD logarithms violate the scaling, there is now an exponential\ncorrection which violates the scaling already at tree level.\nThere is a list of other interesting issues as including spin, flavor, color; soft subprocesses; the\nevolution of the distribution functions, and many others which certainly deserve to be addressed.\nAcknowledgments.
