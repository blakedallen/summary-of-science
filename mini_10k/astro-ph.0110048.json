We report on the results of a spectroscopic and photometric study of a new cataclysmic variable,\nidentified as optical counterpart of the X-ray source RX J1554.2+2721 detected by ROSAT. The spectroscopic\nobservations of the relatively bright (\u223c 16.m 5) object show systematic radial velocity variations with a semiamplitude of \u223c140 km/sec. Besides the clear presence of distinct low and high states there are periodic photometric\nlight variations with an amplitude of about 0.15 magnitude in the R band. The orbital period is 2.h 753 thus being\nwithin the period gap, at its upper border. The flux distribution in the spectrum of the object shows a substantial\ncontribution of a M4 v secondary, and also bears clear signs of cyclotron emission. Thus, we classify the discovered\nobject as a new member of the AM Her class of magnetic cataclysmic variables. This classification is further\nsupported by the soft X-ray spectrum, the characteristic profiles of the emission lines, the tomography map and\nthe shape of the orbital light curve. A simple fitting of the spectrum in the low and high states suggests a reduced\nmass transfer rate in RX J1554.2+2721 compared to similar objects outside the period gap.\nKey words. stars: individual: RX J1554.2+2721 - stars:novae, cataclysmic variables - stars: binaries: close - X-rays:\nstar: star - polars:star magnetic CVs\n\n1. Introduction\nCataclysmic variables (CVs) are close binary systems in\nwhich mass is transferred from a red dwarf star that fills\nits Roche lobe onto a white dwarf (WD). The AM Her\nstars, or polars, are a subclass of CVs containing a synchronously rotating, accreting, magnetic white dwarf. The\nhigh (B\u22655 MG) magnetic field of the WD prevents the formation of an accretion disc and channels the transferred\nmatter along the magnetic lines directly onto the surface\nof the WD (Warner 1995). The polars, in contrast to many\nother CVs accreting through a disk, do not produce dwarf\nnova outbursts, but rather switch erratically from high luminosity states to low states. These changes in luminosity\nare believed to be due to a change of mass transfer rate.\nThe reason of such changes is not clear, although irradiation of the secondaries in polars might be one of the\ncontributing factors (King & Cannizzo 1998). Alternative\npossibilities and an extensive discussion of such behavior\nin polars has been presented by Howell et al. (2000).\nSend offprint requests to: G.

Usually, CVs have orbital periods ranging from 80 min up to \u223c 10 hours with a\nhighly significant deficiency (called the orbital period\ngap) at 2h < Porb < 3h (e.g., Robinson et al. 1983,\nRitter et al. 1995). Over the past decade, only \u223c 25\nCV systems were reported to have periods between 2.h 0\nand 3.h 0 among \u223c 300 CVs with known orbital periods\n(Downes et al. 1997). The existence of the period gap is\nmost commonly explained in terms of angular momentum loss during evolution. Magnetic breaking is considered the driving force for the systems above the period\ngap (Rappaport et al. 1983). It halts at the periods of\n\u22483 hours. Then the systems drift to smaller separations\nwithout mass transfer and thus are faint and mostly unobservable as a CV. At periods of about 2 hours, other\nmechanisms, e.g. gravitational waves, become significant\nto ignite the mass flow from the donor star, and the\nsystem regains its brightness because accretion resumes\n(Howell et al. 1997 and references therein). However, polars are found rather often in the period gap either narrowing it substantially or casting doubts on its existence\nat all. The observed low value of the mass transfer rate\n\n\f2\n\nTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nFig. 1. X-ray light curve of RX J1554.2+2721 derived\nfrom the pointed ROSAT PSPC observation 800551p in\nJul/Aug 1993. The observation was split into three observation intervals, separated by 3.9 and 25 days, respectively. Each of the panels shows a 2300 sec stretch of the\nobservation with the time given relative to the start of the\nobservation.\nfor polars is sufficient reason for the absence of a period\ngap in their distribution (Wickramasinghe & Wu 1994).\nAs Li et al. (1994) have shown, the magnetic breaking\nmay not apply to magnetic systems.\nHere we report the discovery of a new cataclysmic variable, called RX J1554.2+2721 (=1RXS\nJ155412.7+272143) which is of the AM Her type (the\nROSAT source was very recently identified independently\nas a CV by Jiang et al. (2000), while this paper was in\npreparation). RX J1554.2+2721 has an orbital period of\n2.h 753, which places it at the very edge of the upper limit\nof the period gap. Each new object in the period gap is\nvery important for theoretical models of the evolution of\nCVs.\n\n2. Observation and data analysis\n2.1. X-ray observations\nRX J1554.2+2721 was scanned during the ROSAT allsky-survey over a period of 4 days in August 1991 for a\ntotal observing time of 380 sec. Its mean count rate in the\nROSAT position-sensitive proportional counter (PSPC)\nwas 0.12 cts/s, and the hardness ratio HR1 = \u22120.78\u00b10.15\nwhere HR1 is defined as (H\u2013S)/(H+S), with H (S) being\nthe counts above (below) 0.4 keV over the full PSPC range\nof 0.1\u20132.4 keV.\nRX J1554.2+2721 was serendipitously covered by\na pointed ROSAT PSPC observation, though at very\nlarge off-axis angle. This observation (800551p) was performed in July/August 1993 for 6090 sec, and detects\nRX J1554.2+2721 at a (vignetting corrected) mean count\nrate of 0.14 cts/s. For the spectral and timing analysis the source photons were extracted with a radius\n\nFig. 2. ROSAT PSPC X-ray spectrum of RX\nJ1554.2+2721 derived from the pointed observation\n800551p fitted with a sum of a blackbody and a thermal\nbremsstrahlung model. The lower left panel shows the\ndeviation between data and model in units of \u03c72 per bin.\nof 6.\u2032 5. The background was chosen between 7.5\u201310\u2032\nwide ring sector of 270\u25e6 disregarding a 90\u25e6 part along\nthe rim of the field of view. Standard corrections were\napplied using the dedicated EXSAS software package\n(Zimmermann et al. 1994).\n\n2.1.1. X-ray light curve\nThe light curve of the three separate exposure intervals\nof observation 800551p in July/August 1993 is shown in\nFig. 1 with a 100 sec binning. Two things are immediately obvious: (i) the count rate varies between a mean\nfloor of 0.1\u20130.2 cts/s to up to 0.4 cts/s during peaks; and\n(ii) there are \"dips\" of nearly zero count rate at regular\nintervals of about 400 sec. These \"dips\" are due to the\nwobble of the ROSAT satellite which occasionally places\nRX J1554.2+2721 outside of the field-of-view. Thus, the\nmean count rate as given above is certainly a lower limit to\nthe actual intensity. Apart from this cosmetic effect, this\nalso makes a folding over the best-fit orbital period (see\nbelow) rather useless, since it introduces spurious features\nin addition to the low phase coverage caused by the short\nexposure time.\n\n2.1.2. X-ray spectrum\nThe X-ray spectrum during the pointed observation is very\nsoft (HR1 = \u22120.9 \u00b1 0.1). Fitting a one-component model,\ne.g. a simple black body model, results in a large reduced\n\u03c72 = 2.8. Applying a sum of a black body and a thermal bremsstrahlung model with the temperature of the\nlatter component fixed to 20 keV (it is not constrained at\nall by the ROSAT data) gives a good reduced \u03c72 = 0.9\n(see Fig. 2) and the following fit parameters: kTbbdy =\n17\u00b115 eV, NH = 3.3\u00d71020 cm\u22122 . For a better comparison to the parameters of similar sources we also fixed the\n\n\fTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\n3\n\nsure times were 300 sec and 180 sec, respectively, which\nleads to a time resolution of 350 & 230 sec, taking into\naccount the dead time due to read-outs. The standard reduction techniques of CCD photometry were applied using\nthe DAOPHOT package in IRAF to measure differential\nmagnitudes. The images were corrected for bias and flatfield before aperture photometry was carried out. The dispersion of magnitudes ranged from 0.005 to 0.01 mag as\nmeasured from the differential photometry of comparison\nstars with a similar brightness. Unfortunately, no absolute\ncalibration for our photometric data was obtained.\nThe light curve shows \u2248 0.m 15 smooth brightness variations. The nightly mean magnitudes fall into two categories, with 0.6 mag difference between them. The shape\nof the light curves changes together with the change of the\nmean magnitude. There is no notable flickering or short\ntime scale oscillations. For the results of the period analysis and the differences in the light curves as well as their\ninterpretation we refer to the following sections.\nFig. 3.

Optical observations\nThe CCD photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nRX J1554.2+2721 were carried out at the 1.5m & 2.12m\ntelescopes of the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional de\nSan Pedro M\u00e1rtir (OAN SPM), Mexico and at the 6 m\ntelescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences (SAO RAS). The log of\nobservations is presented in the Table 1. Inspection of\nthe spectrum of the brightest object in the ROSAT 30\u2032\u2032\nerror box (Fig. 3) showed that it has spectral characteristics typical to a CV.

Optical photometry\nWe obtained time-resolved Rc -band photometry of\nRX J1554.2+2721 during two nights on May 26 & August\n1st, 2000 at the 1.5m telescope. Several additional measurements were obtained in March and October 2000. The\ntelescope was equipped with a SITE CCD in a direct imaging mode. In total, the object was monitored during \u223c 6.h 3\n(3.h 3 the first night and 3h the second night). The expo-\n\n2.2.2. Optical spectrophotometry\nTwo spectra of the object were taken on April 11, 2000\nusing the Boller & Chivens spectrograph installed in the\nCassegrain focus of the 2.12m telescope of OAN SPM.\nThe 300 l/mm grating was used to cover a wide range of\nwavelengths spanning from 4000 to 7600 \u00c5.\nTime-resolved spectroscopy of the optical counterpart of RX J1554.2+2721 was obtained on April 12 and\nSeptember 18, 2000 on the same telescope and same spectrograph. We used the 400 l/mm grating with a 13o 54\nblaze in the second order, combined with the blue BG39\nfilter and a TEK1024 \u00d7 1024pixel CCD with a 0.24\u03bc pixel\nsize. The slit width was 1.5 arcsec projected on the sky.\nThe seeing was satisfactory with \u2264 1.2 arcsec. The exposure times were 600 and 720 sec. The spectral range from\n\u03bb 3800 \u00c5 to 5100 \u00c5 was covered with spectral resolution of\n1.5 \u00c5/pix leading to a 2.8 \u00c5 FWHM resolution. In total,\n26 spectra were obtained, among them eight in September\n2000.\nA number of additional spectra were obtained in\nOctober 2000. Two spectra were obtained on October\n5 with similar settings as the previous September observations at SPM. During the next night we acquired\nthree more spectra at the 6 m telescope of SAO in Russia,\none in the blue region \u03bb 3700\u20136100 \u00c5 and two at \u03bb 5700\u2013\n8100 \u00c5 wavelength range, The UAGS spectrograph with\nthe Photometrix CCD was used in order to obtain \u22485 \u00c5\nFWHM resolution spectra. He-Ar arc spectra were used\nduring all observations for wavelength calibration. In all\ncases except the September and October SPM observations, spectrophotometric standard stars were observed in\norder to perform flux calibration. The IRAF long slit spectroscopic reduction package was used for the extraction\nof spectra, wavelength and flux calibrations. Before these\nsteps, the images were corrected for bias and cosmic rays.\n\n\f4\n\nTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nTable 1.

The sum of high state spectra of RX J1554.2+2721\nobtained in April 2000. In the upper panel higher resolution spectra in the blue part. In the bottom panel red portion of lower resolution spectra. Most of the spectral lines\nare marked. The spectrum of M4 v standard star and the\nresult of subtraction of the red star from observed spectrum of RX J1554.2+2721 are presented too.\nIt appeared that the October spectra were obtained\nwhen RX J1554.2+2721 was in a low state, while the rest\nof the spectra were acquired with the system being in a\nhigh state.\nIn Fig. 4 we present the average (after correcting the\nwavelengths for orbital motion) of all high-resolution spectra and the red portion of the low-resolution spectra of\nRX J1554.2+2721 in the high state. They exhibit all emission lines characteristic to CVs, and also clear TiO absorption features from the M-dwarf secondary. Some major\nspectral features are marked in Fig. 4. A comparison with\nspectra of main-sequence late type stars yields a spectral\ntype later than M3 v and earlier than M5 v.

The resulting components fall into two categories according to\ntheir widths, amplitudes of radial velocity (RV) variations\nand phases. The dominant and thus more easily distinguishable narrow emission line (NEL) component shows\na FWHM of approximately 4\u20136 \u00c5. It was separated from\nthe rest, and underwent period analysis. The power spectrum produces a broad peak around 8.7 day\u22121 if only\nthe data of one night with the longest coverage are used.\nThe corresponding power spectrum is presented in the\nlower panel of Fig. 5. Its maximum value closely coincides\nwith the photometric period. The photometric data also\nproduce a broad feature in the power spectrum (second\npanel from the bottom in Fig. 5). Adding the September\ndata to the spectroscopic sequence moves the highest peak\nin the power spectrum to shorter periods (third panel).\nFinally, including two more points obtained in October,\nshifts the highest peak in the power spectrum to a higher\nfrequency (\u22489.7 day\u22121 ), as can be seen on the top panel\nof Fig. 5. However, the latter value hardly can be acceptable, since the analysis of one night data does not support the possibility of such short a period. We selected\nthe maximum peak in the range of values between 8.5 and\n9.0 day\u22121 as the most plausible for the orbital period of\nRX J1554.2+2721. This corresponds to 0.d 11473\u00b10.d0006\n= 2.h 7535. This error of period estimate is rather technical, assuming that we selected the right peak in the power\nspectrum. However, we do not have efficient way to distinguish it unambiguously based on our data. (when this paper was already submitted to the publication Thorstensen\netal (2001) reported a 2.h 52 period for this object, which\ndoes not contradict neither our period analysis, nor the\nmain results following from there).\n\n\f5\n\nRV\n\nH\n\n(km s 1)\n\nTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nFig. 5.

Our best fit\nyielded KN EL = 139 km/sec with a standard deviation\nof \u03c3 = 43 km/sec. The RV curve and our fit of the NEL\ncomponent are presented in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.\nThe other component, although not well distinguishable at some phases, has an amplitude and orbital\nphasing typical to the high velocity component (HVC)\nas defined in studies of magnetic CVs (Cropper 1990,\nSchwope et al. 1997). It is assumed to originate in the ballistic part of the accretion stream. The HV component of\nemission lines is shown on the upper panel of Fig. 6.

Photometry\nAs mentioned above, the system switches from one luminosity state to the other very frequently. We present\nthe behavior of the object in Fig. 7. The mean differential magnitudes of the system in comparison to a nearby\nstar as measured from photometric observations differ by\nup to 0.m 65. In the case of spectral observations, when no\nflux calibration was available we can guess the state of\nthe system from the appearance of the spectrum. It shows\nthat the system undergoes a change of state almost every\nmonth. Actually, we do not know any other similar system\nwhich does these state changes so frequently.\nFig. 8 demonstrates the Rc light curve of\nRX J1554.2+2721 folded with the orbital period\nand phased in accordance to the above derived orbital\nparameters. The bottom panel displays the light curve\nobtained in the low luminosity state. The upper panel\npresents the light curve of RX J1554.2+2721 while the\nsystem was in the high state. There are several important\nfeatures which distinguish these two curves:\nIn the low state the system shows a pronounced double\nhumped curve. Taking into account the large contribution\nof the secondary in the total light we assume that in the\nR band during the low state we see mainly the surface\nof the secondary star. It is elliptically distorted by filling\nits corresponding Roche lobe and irradiated.

The amplitude of variation is about 0.2\nmagnitudes, a \u223c 0.m 07 increase from the low state value.\nThe primary minimum is also changed, being broader and\nflatter at the bottom. We suppose that additional cyclotron emission starts to play a role in the total flux,\nwhen the pole is in view. There is also a significant contribution of the H\u03b1 line in the high state in comparison\nto the low state. Also, there appears to be some flickering\nin the light curve during the high state.\n\n4.2. Spectrophotometry\nThe changes in the spectra of RX J1554.2+2721 between\nthe high and low states are even more drastic. The broad\nband photometry in R includes a large contribution from\nthe secondary, while the change of flux is conditioned by\nthe accretion rate, and thus significant changes occur in\nthe blue part of the spectrum. In Fig. 10 the low resolution\nspectra of RX J1554.2+2721 are presented in both states.\nThe red portion of the spectra are dominated by the secondary star. It is very unusual that any cataclysmic variable in a high state, with a period shorter than 4\u20136 hours,\nwill bear clear signs of its secondary in its spectrum at\nwavelengths shortward of H\u03b1. Commonly, the contribution from accretion, either disk in most CVs or magnetic\ndriven in polars, is the dominating source of light in the\nwhole optical range during the high state. Therefore, we\nconclude that in RX J1554.2+2721 we have a reduced\naccretion rate even during the high state.\n\nFig. 8. Phase folded Rc light curves of RX J1554.2+2721,\nseparately in high state (upper panel) and low state (bottom panel).\n\nAnother indication of low accretion is the narrowness\nof the emission lines of the system when it is in the low\nstate. Actually, their regular Gaussian profiles, the 4 \u00c5\nfull widths as measured in two higher resolution spectra\nobtained in October, and the absence of the high velocity\ncomponent belonging to the accretion stream, suggest an\nalmost complete halt of the mass transfer.\n\nima. This is due to the changing aspect of the secondary's\nRoche-lobe which presents the largest projected area, and\nhence highest flux at phases 0.25 & 0.75. At phase 0.0 &\n0.5 the projected area is the smallest. The flux decrease at\nphase 0.5 is smaller than at phase 0.0, because that side\nof the secondary has a higher temperature due to illumination, and hence is more luminous than the back side.\nWe estimate the mean amplitude of brightness variation from our Rc band light curve to be 0.13 magnitude\nin the low state. Using the equation (2.109b) from Warner\n(1995) we obtain an inclination of the system of 45o \u2212 55o,\nassuming a mass ratio 0.42 < q < 0.62 for corresponding masses of the white dwarf of 0.39 \u2212 0.57M\u2299 and sec-\n\nThe blue part of the continuum completely changes its\nshape when the system switches from the high to the low\nluminosity state. The humps seen in the continuum during\nthe high state become more pronounced, and the blue end\nof the spectrum drops by up to one order of magnitude.\nIn order to understand the composition of the system,\nwe have to examine the major contributors of emission in\npolars. In polars, except for photospheric emission from\nboth components (which can be readily excluded here),\nthe widely accepted sources of the flux are the following\nfour components originating in the hot postshock region\nor its vicinity, where in-falling matter above the magnetic\npole slows down and heats up before settling on the surface\nof the WD:\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nOrbital Phase\n\n\fTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\n\u2013 Hard X-ray bremsstahlung emitted from an optically\nthin column.\n\u2013 Blackbody radiation, thermalized and remitted by the\nheated surface of the WD in the soft X-ray and UV\nregions.\n\u2013 Cyclotron emission from the column. It is emitted in\na wide range of wavelengths from the near UV to the\ninfrared region.\n\u2013 Recombination emission, depending on the strength of\nthe illuminating X-rays.\nWe are primarily interested in the latter two as the\nmost probable sources of light in the blue part of our spectra.\n\n4.3. Continuum Modelling\nExamination of the spectral appearance in the low state,\nwhere cyclotron lines are seen as broad humps in the\ncontinuum, and comparison to identical objects (most remarkably HS 1023+3900 (Reimers 1999)), strongly advocate the cyclotron nature of the observed flux. Actually, if\nnot for tiny emission remaining in the lower order Balmer\nlines, apparently coming from the irradiated secondary,\nand significant contribution of secondary photosphere in\nthe continuum, the spectrum of RX J1554.2+2721 in the\nlow state is very identical to that of HS 1023+3900 during its low state. The difference is only in the location\nof the cyclotron humps due to the difference in magnetic\nfield. Luckily, in the case of RX J1554.2+2721 we have\nobserved the system spectroscopically in both luminosity states, high and low. In the high state, the spectral\nappearance is notably different. We can see broader, multicomponent emission lines, higher orders of Balmer lines\nand appearance of not very strong He ii emission in the\nspectrum, completely absent in the low state. In addition,\na hot component changes the slop of the continuum in the\nblue side of the spectrum. We subtracted the low state\nspectrum from the averaged spectrum in the high state.\nThe absence of orbital coverage in the low state prevents\nus from studying phase related effects. The resulting energy distribution, presented in Fig. 9 clearly consists of\ntwo components. Redward of 4800 \u00c5 it is flat, while blueward it rises steeply (power law index=-4 !). It hardly can\nbe attributed to the blending by Balmer lines in vicinity\nof the Balmer jump (the Balmer lines are well resolved in\nthe higher resolution spectra up to H10 , yet continuum is\nconsistent with the lower resolution spectra), nor to the\nsimple addition of a black body, e.g. from a hot spot. The\npower law is presented by the dashed line in Fig. 9, it\nroughly indicates a blackbody with Tef f \u226b100 000 K.\nAlternatively to cyclotron emission, the low and high\nstate transition could potentially also be due to off/on\nstates of recombination emission. In the low state there is\nno He ii emission at all, and He i is very weak, indicating\nthat the excitation by X-rays is very low. Thus, it is conceivable that the illumination of the stream is so low that\nalso no recombination emission is present. If, during the\n\n7\n\noptical high state, the accretion rate increases, X-ray emission sets in, causing accordingly He ii excitation, and also\nrecombination emission. Normally in magnetic CVs one\nwould expect recombination emission to come from stream\nwhere typical assumed temperatures are of the order of\n20 000 K only. We calculated the recombination emission\nenergy distribution for 20 000 K and also for hypothetical\nsource with temperatures as high as 5 and 15 keV. The\ninput parameters are the edge energy (Paschen jump in\nour case), the temperature and a normalization parameter. The dot\u2013dashed line in the Fig. 9 corresponds to a\n15 keV temperature. Lower temperature curves are naturally much flatter. Even 15 keV source is apparently not\nsteep enough to satisfactory fit the additional source of\nemission. The slope actually does not depend on the temperature of the source, thus recombination emission solely\ncan not be responsible for explaining the transformation.\nWe sought an explanation of the continuum energy\ndistribution of RX J1554.2+2721 and its changes in\ncyclotron emission, and found satisfactory fits to explain\nboth high and low luminosity states. The solution is\nnot commonly applicable to the rest of polars, but\nwe consider this object to be of different breed along\nwith HS 1023+3900 due to its very low accretion rate,\ndistinct from polars outside the \"period gap\". There is\nan extensive theoretical work on modelling the transfer\nof radiation through the standard accretion column\n(Chanmugam 1981,\nMeggitt & Wickramasinghe 1984,\nBarrett & Chanmugam 1984).\nBarrett & Chanmugam (1985) applied their models\nto fit the spectra of the magnetic CV VV Pup. We\nfollowed their procedures in constraining our models in\norder to describe the observed flux of RX J1554.2+2721.\nThe authors demonstrate how the absorption and emission features of cyclotron emission originate and how\nthey differ. In order to obtain an absorption spectrum\none has to assume the presence of a cooler magnetized\nplasma layer with a hotter blackbody (BB) source behind\nit, representing the postshock region. On the other hand,\nan emission cyclotron spectrum will arise from the slab of\nplasma representing the postshock region of the accretion\ncolumn itself. The comparison of sample models presented\nby Barrett & Chanmugam (1985), demonstrates that\nin the case of a pure emission spectrum the blue end of\nthe spectrum is rapidly decreasing. At the same time,\nthe absorption cyclotron spectrum, from an optically\nthick slab, is Rayleigh-Jeans-like and exhibits a steep rise\ntoward the blue, similar to blackbody radiation.\nRegarding the modelling it is necessary to note that\nthe absorption cyclotron spectrum never was used in the\nactual modelling of any observed object, even by the authors of the model. The above mentioned model does\nnot take into account the geometry of the magnetic spot,\nwhile there are modern models (e.g Woelk & Beuermann\n(1992), Rousseau et al. (1996) and more recently Fischer\n& Beuermann (2001)), that successfully calculate corresponding parameters over the whole white dwarf atmosphere. However, from one hand being restricted by a few\n\n\f8\n\nTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nspectra in the low state not covering all orbital phases,\nand on the other hand being able to achieve satisfactory\nresults in fitting the observed flux distribution by simple\nmodels, we did not aim determination of exact parameters\nof the system by applying state of the art models, rather\nthan sought explanation of its nature.\nThus, we used the Barrett & Chanmugam (1985)\nmodel to fit the observed continuum of RX J1554.2+2721\nby a least square fit of\nsX\n\u03c3=\n(Fobs (\u03bb) \u2212 Fmod (\u03bb))2\n(2)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere Fobs are relative fluxes normalized to F\u03bb8100 = 1 in\nthe low or high state with emission lines excluded from\nthe analysis. Fmod is actually a sum\nFmod = a \u2217 Fem + b \u2217 FM4 + c \u2217 Fabs ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Fem is cyclotron emission from an optically thin\nmedium, while Fabs is cyclotron emission from optically\nthick parts of the accretion column, and FM4 is the spectrum of the M4 v secondary star. The coefficients a, b &\nc determine the relative contributions of the corresponding components. Fem and Fabs are functions of the magnetic field (B), the effective temperature of the underlying source (kT ), the angle (\u0398) between the magnetic field\nand the line of sight, and the dimensionless parameter\n\u039b = \u03c9p L/\u03c9B c. Here \u03c9p is the plasma frequency, \u03c9B is the\ncyclotron frequency and L is the thickness of the plasma\nslab.\nLow state spectrum: Usually in similar cases one assumes a temperature (say 10 or 15 or 20 keV), also as-\n\n-4.0\n\nFig. 9. The differential spectrum of RX J1554.2+2721\nbetween high and low luminosity states. The additional\nemission responsible for changes is very \"hot\". The dashed\nline representing power law is drawn to give an idea of its\nsteepness. Also plotted are flux distributions of recombination emission and cyclotron optically thick emission.\n\nsumes a \u0398 (say 70 degrees), in order to find plausible parameters B and \u039b, which will place synchrotron humps in\nthe right places. Location of humps strongly depends on B\nand \u039b parameters, while temperature (kT) and \u0398 parameter rather influence shape of the humps. Since in most of\nthe cases there are many other contributing components\nthe fitting becomes limited by the \"cross-correlation\" of\nhumps in the model with the observed spectra. Location of\nhumps becomes crucial in determination of the magnetic\nfield, which is the most relevant parameter.\nHowever in RX J1554.2+2721 we have somehow a\nunique sort of low-state spectrum, where in order to\nachieve a good fit we do not need anything else but secondary spectrum + Fem . Thus we can fit Fem much more\nprecisely, than usually can be done. What we did was to\ndo least-squares along the spectrum with some initial parameters floating them all four of them and came up with\nthe result, very nicely describing the observed data.\nThe hump at around H\u03b2 is very distinct and it was\neasy to find the corresponding initial parameters, and after\nwards refine them with least-square fitting. The contribution of the hot component Fabs in the low state spectrum\nwas set to zero (c=0). The calculated emission cyclotron\nspectrum is shown by a thin dashed-dotted line in Fig.\n10. Its combination with a M4 v, secondary star spectrum\n(tiny dotted line) gives a resulting best fit to the lowstate observed spectrum shown as the lower thick solid\nline in Fig. 10. The following parameters were inferred\nfrom the cyclotron emission model: B = 31 MG; \u0398 = 56\u25e6 ;\nkT = 14 keV; \u039b = 6.6 \u00d7 105 . Of course the shape of spectrum should change with orbital phase, thus the obtained\nparameters will vary too. That basically refers to \u0398 and \u039b.\nTemperature is in range, which one would expect to find in\na polar, although it is higher than in HS 1023+3900. The\nM4 v secondary contribution is \u223c50% to the total flux in\nthe Rc filter and only \u223c10% in the B band. The remaining deviation of the modelled spectrum from the observed\none can be explain as the consequence of the deviation of\nthe emission region geometry from the simple and homogeneous geometry of the Barrett & Chanmugam model,\nand/or the deviation of the radiation of the optical thin\nplasma in the magnetic field from thermal radiation.\nHigh state spectrum: The examination of the spectra\nin the high state demonstrate that the hump at around\n\u03bb 4800 \u00c5 is still detected, although less pronounced. Thus,\nwe believe that the spectrum in the high-state is composed\nof the same components as in the low state with the addition of a hot component which we identify as cyclotron\nemission from the optically thick portion of the plasma\nslab in the model. This component is responsible for the\nexcess of flux in the near UV region. It is much steeper\n(in the wavelength range shortward of 4500 \u00c5) than recombination emission, as can be seen in Fig. 9. Indeed,\nthe addition of an absorption cyclotron component shown\nas dashed line in Fig. 10, brings a good agreement between the composite spectrum and the observed one in\nthe high state. The resulting fit to the high state spectrum is shown as another (upper) thick solid line in Fig.\n\n\fTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\n9\n\nRelative Flux\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n3700\n\n4700\n\n5700\n6700\nWavelength (A)\n\n7700\n\no\n\nFig. 10. The low-resolution spectra of RX J1554.2+2721 in high and low states are presented (thin solid line).\nThe dotted line corresponds to the M4 v star spectrum. Dashed and dot-dashed lines are the theoretical cyclotron\nabsorption and emission spectra of plasma in the magnetic field of the WD respectively. Thick solid lines are representing the resulting fits to the continuum of the RX J1554.2+2721 in the high and low states (see the discussion\nin 4.3).\n10. Assuming that the high luminosity is due to a higher\naccretion rate, we suppose that an increase of matter in\nthe accretion column may create favorable conditions for\nthe appearance of an optically thick, absorption cyclotron\nspectrum. The parameters of the absorption cyclotron\nemission which we obtained from the fitting confirm this.\nWith the magnetic field strength and angle remaining the\nsame, the parameter \u039b = 40.6 \u00d7 105 shows a five-fold increase as compared to the emission spectrum from the\noptically thin layer in the optical low state. This increase\nmost probably is conditioned by the increased density of\nthe matter in the column. Meanwhile, the temperature\nof the optically thick matter fits better to the observed\nflux at kT = 18.5 keV, but it may vary significantly without major impact on the final result. It is worth mentioning, that in the high-state spectrum fits, both cyclotron\ncomponents contribute, showing that we have optically\nthick and thin plasma at the same time. The temperature of optically thin emission-cyclotron radiation however remains at around 14 keV as in the low state. But,\nthe overall contribution of the optically thin emission is\n\nincreased in comparison to the low state, which may be\nthe result of an increase of the emitting area. The contribution of the corresponding components is estimated as\nfollows: In the red part of the spectrum (Rc band) the\ncontribution of emission-cyclotron emission rises to 60%,\nwith the rest coming from the secondary star. In the B\nband the absorption cyclotron emission from the optically\nthick plasma contributes up to \u223c40% of total flux, while\nthe optically thin plasma is responsible for \u223c55%, and the\nremaining \u223c5% are coming from the secondary star. It is\nnot excluded, however, that part of the emission in the\nnear UV has a recombination origin. In that case the budget will be slightly different of course. From our data it is\ndifficult to estimate the relative contribution of recombination emission and optically thick cyclotron absorption.\nIt is important, however, that recombination emission only\nwill not be enough to explain the blue/ultraviolet excess\nin the high state, and the suggested scenario above may\nbe a reasonable alternative.\n\n\f10\n\nTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nscale image in Fig. 11.

Doppler tomography\nDoppler tomography (Marsh & Horne 1988) is a widely\nused method to extract further information on CVs from\ntrailed spectra. In the case of magnetic CVs, particularly\npolars, Doppler tomography in most cases reveals a very\ndistinctive pattern: the compact spot appears at the location of the heated tip of the secondary star with a diffuse\narm extending from the L1 point almost perpendicular\nat first, then bending toward negative velocities (both Vx\nand Vy ). It follows closely the calculated trajectory of free\nfalling matter from the Lagrangian point.\nWe used the code developed by Spruit (1998) to obtain\na Doppler map of RX J1554.2+2721 using the maximum\nentropy method. The resulting Doppler map (or tomogram) of the He ii emission line is displayed as a gray-\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have studied the new cataclysmic variable\nRX J1554.2+2721 discovered by ROSAT observations. The soft X-ray spectrum and strong X-ray\nvariability immediately suggests a magnetic cataclysmic\nvariable nature. The follow-up optical spectral and\nphotometric observations provided additional support\nfor this classification. The continuum spectrum shows\ndirect evidence of the presence of a magnetic accreting\nWD in the system. These, combined with emission line\nprofiles, RV curves and Doppler maps, and characteristic\nlight curve undoubtedly supports the magnetic nature of\nRX J1554.2+2721.\nWe derived Porb = 2.h 753 = 165.2 min for\nRX J1554.2+2721, placing it inside the period gap for\nCVs. This period is very close (even shorter) of the recently discovered HS 1023+3900 (Reimers 1999). The latter is considered unique, because it exhibits a pure cyclotron emission line spectrum. Reimers (1999) claims that\nthe appearance of the spectrum is a result of extremely low\nmass transfer rate, which in turn is supported by the evolutionary scenarios, according to which the mass transfer\ncomes to a halt in the period gap and systems become\nundetached.\nRX J1554.2+2721 is another system in this range of\norbital periods showing a reduced accretion rate, and actually barely any in the low state. The switches between\nhigh and low states also demonstrate a little bit unusual\nfrequency, which might be the sign of a system at the verge\nof its accretion era. The continuous monitoring of this object may provide additional insights into the behavior of\nthe CVs and particularly magnetic ones in the period gap.\nWe\ncalculated\nthe\ncyclotron\nspectra\nfor\nRX J1554.2+2721 in the low and high states. Our\nmain conclusions on the origin of optical radiation in the\ncontinuum are as follows:\n1. RX J1554.2+2721 has a magnetic field strength of\nthe WD of 3\u00d7107 Gauss, and a postshock plasma temperature of 14 keV nicely consistent with the above assumed\n20 keV hard X-ray component.\n2. In the low state we have pure emission cyclotron\nspectrum from the optically thin cyclotron emitting\nsource. In the high state we have probably a higher accretion rate, and we assume that an optically thick zone\nforms in the core of the accretion column. Therefore, the\n\n\fTovmassian et al.: RX J1554.2+2721 \u2013 new CV in the period gap\n\nhigh state spectra can be described by enhanced low state\nemission plus additional radiation consisting of the combination of an optically thick cyclotron-absorption spectrum\nregion and possibly recombination emission from reprocessed X-rays.\n3. The remaining small deviations between the modelled and observed spectra of RX J1554.2+2721 can be\nexplained as a consequence of the deviation of the emission\nregion geometry from the simple geometry of the Barrett\n& Chanmugam model and/or the deviation of the radiation of the optical thin plasma in the magnetic field from\na thermal model.\nWe estimate the mass and radius of the secondary\nstar as M2 = 0.24M\u2299 and R2 = 0.29R\u2299 from the massperiod and radius-period relations of Echevarr\u0131\u0301a (1983).\nThe mass is consistent with the observed M4 v classification of the secondary and the assumption that it is not\nmuch different from a main-sequence star of corresponding\ntemperature.\nThe mass ratio q and inclination angle i of the system\nwere estimated from the amplitude of ellipsoidal variations\nof the secondary in the low state and independently confirmed and refined from Doppler tomography to be around\n0.5 and 50\u25e6 , respectively.\nThe distance to RX J1554.2+2721 also can be estimated from the intensity of the secondary in the spectra of RX J1554.2+2721 in the low and high states.\nThe flux of the M4 v star at 5500 \u00c5 or in the V\nband, is 6 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg/cm2 /s/\u00c5, corresponding to a\nbrightness of V = 19.45 magnitude (for example, see\nFukugita et al. 1995). A M4v star has MV = 12.95 (for\nexample G 165-8 in Henry et al. 1994). Assuming a maximum interstellar absorption in this direction of AV =\n0.2 mag (Dickey et al. 1990), we estimate a distance to\nthis binary system of about 180\u2013200 pc. Even if the high\nvalue of the distance estimates were correct, the correspondingly higher luminosity which we derive from the\nmeasured flux would still be lower than that of most magnetic CVs.\nWith a distance estimate available, we can also infer the accretion rate by assuming that the accretion luminosity is emitted mostly in X-rays. We apply equation 6.10 from Warner 1995 and estimate \u1e40 using the\nbolometric luminosity from X-ray observation as \u1e40 \u223c\n4 \u00d7 10\u221212 (d/180)2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nIn this brief report we did not intent to derive all parameters of this very interesting new discovered polar.\nNew observations are necessary to study this system in\nmore detail. Meanwhile, its existence seems to provide a\ngood test bed for existing evolutionary models.\n\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to A.
