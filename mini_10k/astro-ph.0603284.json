Introduction\nThere is now conspicuous observational and theoretical\nevidence that the radiation of cosmic gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) is produced in highly relativistic collimated outflows. A jet geometry was originally invoked as a solution\nfor the \"energy crisis\" by reducing the total energy output\nof a GRB by a factor of \u03a9\u03b3 /4\u03c0, where \u03a9\u03b3 is the solid angle\ninto which gamma-rays are emitted (e.g., Rhoads 1997;\nFruchter et al. 1999). Evidence for the collimation was\nprovided by the theoretically predicted (e.g., Sari 1999;\nGruzinow 1999; Ghisellini & Lazzati 1999) and observed\npolarization evolution of optical afterglows (e.g., Covino\net al. 1999; Wijers et al. 1999; Greiner et al. 2003).\nProminent signatures of the jet geometry were identified already earlier in the broad-band breaks observed in\nthe optical and radio afterglow light curves of several long\nduration GRBs (e.g., Stanek et al. 1999; Harrison et al.\n1999). The opening angles, which have been inferred from\nthese \"jet breaks\" for a number of afterglows, vary from\n1\u25e6 to more than 25\u25e6 , with a strong concentration near 4\u25e6\n(Frail et al. 2001).\nA consequence of the collimation is that the prompt\n\u03b3-ray emission will be detected if the viewing angle of\nthe observer is equal to or smaller than the opening anSend offprint requests to: A. Rau, arne@astro.caltech.edu\n\ngle of the jet, \u03b8jet . This implies that only for a fraction\nof all bursts in the Universe \u03b3-ray photons will reach the\nEarth. The total GRB rate will be higher than the ob\u22122\nserved rate by a factor of roughly \u03b8jet\n\u221d \u03932 in case of a\nuniversal jet structure, where \u0393 is the bulk Lorentz factor\nof the ejecta. For a quasi-universal Gaussian-type jet, the\nrate will be generally smaller. Nevertheless, GRBs which\nare not pointed directly at the observer can in principle\nbe discovered through their afterglow radiation at longer\nwavelengths.\nIn the standard internal-external fireball model (e.g.\nRees & Meszaros 1992, 1994) the afterglow is produced\nwhen the initially highly relativistic ejecta plows into the\nambient medium. The afterglow emission is radiated into a\nsolid angle of \u03a9A \u223c1/\u0393, along the line of motion. When the\njet decelerates, \u03a9A increases until it reaches 4\u03c0. Therefore,\nso-called \"off-axis\" orphan afterglows can be detected for\nbursts which are beamed outside of the field of view of the\nobserver (e.g., Rhoads 1997; Perna & Loeb 1998; Dalal\net al. 2002). The light curves of these off-axis orphan afterglows will initally be faint, brightening up to a viewing\nangle dependent maximum and become similar to regular\nGRB afterglows after the jet break later on (Rhoads 1999;\nNakar & Piran 2003).\nIt is theoretically reasonable to assume that the optical\nafterglow might be emitted from a slower moving mate-\n\n\f2\n\nA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\nrial (a lower \u0393) than the initial \u03b3-ray beam. Therefore,\nso-called \"on-axis\" orphan afterglows are expected when\nthe narrow \u03b3-ray emission misses the observer by a small\namount but the wider optical emission region falls within\nthe observation cone (Nakar & Piran 2003). These afterglows will exhibit similar light curves as regular afterglows\nwith detected prompt emission.\nObservations of orphan afterglows can help to study\nthe initial opening angle of the jets and to place a constraint on the collimation of the optical afterglow emission\n(Rhoads 1997). Especially on-axis orphans are suitable as\nthey are substantially brighter than off-axis orphans and\nthus easier to detect in a dedicated survey (Nakar & Piran\n2003). Additionally, Dalal et al. (2002) pointed out, assuming an uniform jet with constant jet-break time and luminosity at the break time for an on-axis observer, that for\nsmall angles the afterglow effective beaming angle scales\nwith the jet opening angle. Therefore, the number of detectable off-axis orphan afterglows would be independent\nof the jet opening angle and similar for moderately wide\njets (\u223c20 \u25e6 ) and for arbitrarily narrow jets (<0.01 \u25e6 ). In\ncontrast, Totani & Panaitescu (2002) predict a strong dependence of the orphan rate on the jet opening angle assuming a constant total energy in the afterglow jet.\nA small number of surveys dedicated to the search\nof untriggered optical GRB counterparts were performed\nover the past years. No candidate event was found in\n125 hrs monitoring of a field of 256 deg2 with ROTSEI to a limiting magnitude of 15.7 (Kehoe et al. 2002).\nVanden Berk et al. (2002) searched for color-selected transients within 1500 deg2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) down to R=19 and found only one unusual transient which was later identified as a radio-loud AGN exhibiting strong variability (Gal-Yam et al. 2002). The automated RAPTOR wide-field sky monitoring system allows to image 1300 deg2 at a time down to a magnitude of\n\u223c12.5 (Vestrand et al. 2004). A couple of interesting optical transients were found in the B, V and R-band Deep\nLens Survey transient search, within an area of 0.01 deg2\nyr with a limiting magnitude of 24. None of those could be\npositively associated with a GRB afterglow (Becker et al.\n2004). Recently, Rykoff et al. (2005) performed a search\nusing the ROTSE-III telescope array without detecting\nany candidate afterglow events. They placed an upper\nlimit on the rate of fading optical transients with quiescent counterparts dimmer than \u223c20th magnitude of less\nthan 1.9 deg\u22122 yr\u22121 .\nIn this paper we present the results of a survey for optical orphan afterglows with a wide-field imaging instrument and will give an estimate of the GRB collimation\nderived from the detection rate of on-axis orphan afterglows. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we\ndescribe the observational strategy, instrumentation and\nselected survey fields as well as the data reduction and\ntransient detection method. The candidate transients are\npresented in Sect. 3 and the transient detection efficiency\n\nin Sect. 4. A discussion of the results in the context of\nGRB collimation is given in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\n2.1. Strategy, Instrumentation & Survey Fields\nA search for GRB afterglows or other transient phenomena in the sky requires a thorough strategy due to the\nrandom occurence of the events in space and time. As a\ncontinuous monitoring of a large field with a large aperture telescope could only be considered overambitious in\nmany cases, we developed our strategy using the knowledge of the properties of observed optical afterglows at the\ntime when the survey was proposed (1999).\nThe primary idea was to take multiple deep observations of a number of selected sky fields. The observing\nscheme was chosen such that the survey would be sensitive enough (R\u223c23 mag) to provide the detection of a\nGRB orphan afterglow in at least two epochs together\nwith earlier and later upper limits. To combine the availability of a large aperture telescope together with the observed brightness decay of GRB afterglows, we decided to\nperform consecutive observations of a given field in every\n2nd night. Over this time span, on-axis orphan afterglows\nwill in most cases be brighter than R=21. Instead, offaxis orphans are expected to be fainter and will start to\ndominate below that magnitude (Nakar & Piran 2003).\nWe obtained imaging data during three periods (MayJune, August & September-October) in 1999 and monitored 7 different sky fields in up to 25 nights each. Each\nfield is composed of 2 to 8 separate sub-fields and a total of 38 sub-fields were selected. This corresponds to an\narea of \u223c12 square degrees being imaged throughout the\ncampaign. A list of all fields together with the number of\nsub-fields and the maximum number of observing nights\nis provided in Table 1. Note that due to changes of the observing conditions during a night not always a complete\nmonitoring of a given field could be accomplished.\nA total of 39 nights were scheduled using the Wide\nField Imager (WFI) at the MPI/ESO 2.2 m telescope\nin La Silla, Chile. Due to weather constraints only 31\nnights could at least partly be used for observations.\nUnfortunately, the lost nights caused unfavorable interruptions of the otherwise gap-less observing schedule of\neach period and lead to a significantly decreased detection sensitivity for orphan afterglows.\nThe distribution of the time delay between two consecutive observations of a given sub-field is shown in Figure 1.\nWhile the majority of the survey could be observed with\nthe proposed gap of two days between consecutive observations, \u223c15 % suffered from larger gaps due to inappropriate weather conditions. In addition to the regular 2-day\nschedule a small number of nights were included in which\nmultiple observations of selected fields (F1, F3 & F5) were\nperformed within one night. This would allow to identify\nand distinguish possible short-term variable sources (e.g.\nCVs) in these fields.\n\n\fA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\n3\n\nTable 1. Observation log.

A gap\nof \u223c2 arcsec exists between neighboring CCDs of the imager. Throughout the data acquisition the observing conditions varied strongly (see Figure 2).

This\nprovided us with the opportunity to identify possible transient sources in these fields down to R\u223c22 mag using the\nSDSS multi-band informations. Particular care was taken\nto avoid stars brighter then \u223c12th magnitude which would\nnot only saturate the detector but also leave effected pixels less sensitive for subsequent images. Furthermore, high\necliptic lattitudes were favored to maximize the Moon distance, and thus make the fields observable over a large\nfraction of an observing period. Finally, significant foreground extinction was avoided during the field selection.\n\n2.2. Data Reduction\nNearly 700 images were obtained throughout the survey\ncomprising \u223c130 GB of raw data. For the automatic reduction and analysis of this large amount of data a Perlbased pipeline was developed which uses a number of well\ntested astronomical software packages. The basic image reduction was performed using IRAF2 /MSCRED. For each\nnight of observations a common bias frame was produced\nand subtracted from the science images. Flat field correction was performed using daily super-sky-flats produced\nfrom all science observations of a given night without significant illumination by the Moon or other bright sources.\nThe astrometric solutions were obtained separately for\neach of the 8 CCDs with the WIFIX/ASTROMETRIX3\npackage by comparing the positions of detected sources\nwith those compiled in the USNO-A2.0 catalog (Monet\net al. 1998). The resulting astrometric precision is indicated in Figure 3 where the difference in the position of\nisolated sources detected in a sub-field of F6 in multiple observations is shown. About 80 % of the sources lie\nwithin 1/2 detector pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 119) compared to a reference observation taken on May 31, 1999. More than 99 %\nof the sources are detected within a circle of 0.\u2032\u2032 4 radius.\nNote that the double peaked shape of the distribution in\n1\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatories, which are operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n3\nhttp://www.na.astro.it/\u223cradovich/wifix.htm\n2\n\n\f4\n\nA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\nFigure 3 is artificial, resulting from the numerical rounding\nof the pixel coordinates in the source detection algorithm.\n\nFig. 3. Normalized distribution of the distances of \u223c40\nisolated sources detected during the whole survey in the\nfield F6-1 compared to the respective reference positions\nobtained from an observation taken on May 31, 1999 (solid\nline). The dotted and dashed lines indicate the size of 1/2\ndetector pixel and the search radius for the source tracing\nalgorithm, respectively. The selected sources span \u223c5 mag\nin brightness and are distributed over the entire detector\nfield of view.\nThe source detection in the images was performed\nin each of the 8 WFI CCDs separately. We used the\nIRAF/DAOPHOT package to measure the source flux inside a Gaussian-shaped point-spread-function. The search\nfor transient sources does not gain significant benefit from\nan absolut photometric calibration which would be connected with an unavoidable additional systematic zeropoint uncertainty. Instead, we obtained the variability\ninformation using the technique of differential photometry. We selected an ensemble of at least 20 local, nonsaturated, non-variable reference stars for each sub-field.\nBy deriving the median brightness offset of these stars\nwith respect to the brightness of the same stars obtained\nin a reference image of a given sub-field (typically the one\nwith the smallest seeing), the photometric offset between\nthe two observations could be estimated. This was successively done for all observations of a given sub-field and\nthus provided a common photometric zero-point for all\npointings of the respective sub-field.\nAbsolut photometric calibration was obtained based\non observations in one photometric night (October 12,\n1999) of the field SA113 (our F6). This field contains a\nnumber of Landoldt standard stars with well tabulated\noptical photometry (Landoldt 1992)4 . As all photometric\nstandard stars were saturated in the regular 420 s image\ntaken for our survey, we obtained a shorter exposure (20 s)\n4\n\nThe tabulated Cousin R-band magnitudes were transformed to the WFI R-band filter system using the colour and\nextinction terms given at 5 .\n\nduring the same night. In this 20 s frame six non-saturated\nstandard stars were contained and the photometric zero\npoint for this image was obtained (systematic uncertainty\nof \u2206R=0.1 mag). This allowed to produce a sample of secondary standard stars in the field down to a limiting magnitude of R\u223c21 corresponding to a 5\u03c3 detection.\nThe field F6 was observed in nearly all nights of the\nsurvey. This allowed to obtain accurate photometric calibration for the other six fields based on the zero points\nderived from the secondary standards in F6 in a common\nnight. For each field one photometric night was chosen\nand the photometric calibration of all further observations\nwere calibrated with respect to this night. The photometry\nin all fields was additionally corrected for Galactic foreground extinction (AR =0.02\u20130.25) (Schlegel et al. 1998).\nFigure 4 shows the resulting photometric quality for\nan example field (F4) obtained under good seeing conditions (0.\u2032\u2032 8). The uncertainties represent the detection uncertainties in the instrumental magnitude system and do\nnot include the uncertainties resulting from the absolute\nphotometric calibration (\u2206R\u223c0.1 mag). A limiting magnitude of R\u223c23 at 10\u03c3 was reached in this observation. As\ndiscussed above, the observing conditions varied strongly\nthroughout the survey. Thus, the achieved limiting magnitude ranged between R\u223c19 and R\u223c23, depending on\nthe seeing and Moon illumination. Sources brighter than\nR\u223c16 were saturated in a good night.\n\nFig. 4. Photometry obtained for an observation of the\nfield F4 on May 22, 1999 with each dot representing one\nsource. The seeing during the time of the imaging was\n0.\u2032\u2032 8 and a limiting magnitude of R\u223c23 mag with 10\u03c3 was\nreached. Sources brighter than R\u223c16 mag are saturated.\n\n2.3. Transient Detection Method\nFor each of the seven fields a master table including the\ncoordinates and magnitudes of all detected sources in all\nobservations was produced. Herein, we assigned detections\nwithin a distance of 0.\u2032\u2032 75 to a detection obtained in a\nreference image together and consider this as one source.\n\n\fA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\nLight curves were obtained for all detected sources and\ncandidate transient objects were selected based on the deviation of their light curve from their mean light curve.\nFor all candidates with single detections or \u2206R>0.75 mag\n(\u223c12000), light curve plots as well as thumbnail images\nof all pointings were produced. These were examined by\neye in order to remove spurious transients arising from\nnearby bright stars, extended objects, stray light effects\nat the edge of the FoV, bad focus or detections which\nwere consistent with faint stars at the limiting magnitude\nof the individual pointings. The strategy of the survey was\naimed to catch a possible orphan afterglow in at least two\nconsecutive observations. Therefore, we considered only\nsources with at minimum two detections for further investigations. A number of fast moving objects (e.g. air planes,\nterrestrial satellites) could be identified by the trace in the\nimages which they left during the 420 s exposure. Solar\nsystem objects (e.g. asteroids) are especially abundant in\nthe survey fields located close to the ecliptic plane (F3,\nF6 & F7). These sources appear either as one-time detections or show significant motion between subsequent\nobservations and could be identified accordingly. Of the\n\u223c12000 candidates only four remained and were double\nchecked with the positions of known sources compiled in\nthe SIMBAD6 , NED7 and NSV8 databases and if possible\ncorrelated with the SDSS 4th release and the DSS9 .\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Candidate Transients\nThroughout the survey four new transient sources with\ndetections in at least two images were found. Based on\nthe shape of the light curve and amplitude we identified\none candidate cataclysmic variable, one dwarf nova, one\nflare star and one candidate extragalactic transient superimposed on an underlying faint object. For the latter\nan orphan afterglow nature is considered plausible. Below\nwe give a brief description of each of these four transient\nsources (see also Table 2).\nTable 2. Candidate transient sources. The minimum and\nmaximum obtained brightnesses as well as the putative\nclassification are given.\n\n5\n\n3.1.1. J132653.8-212702\nThe source was initially detected in F3 during the first\nnight of observations on May 22, 1999 (MJD 51321.0045).\nThe field was observed four times during that night and\nthe source exhibited a significant brightness increase from\nR=20.4 to R=19.7 within 80 min (Fig. 5a). It was observed again on May 31/June 2, June 17/19 and August\n4/6 and showed a flaring of \u2206R=0.2\u20130.4 mag during each\nof these epochs. No X-ray or optical counterpart was detected in the ROSAT All-Sky survey (taken 1990). No\nentry was found in SIMBAD or NED. The rapid variability excludes slowly varying objects and is consistent with\na cataclysmic variable and/or eclipsing binary. No orbital\nperiod could be obtained due to the sparse sampling of the\nlight curve. The confirmation of the nature of this source\nrequires further monitoring of the variability or simultaenous observations in multiple colours.\n\n3.1.2. J132813.7-214237\nThe source was detected on June 20.07 UT 1999\n(MJD 51349.0430) at its maximum brightness of R=19.9\n(Fig. 5b). Unfortunately, the observing period finished\nafter the observation of the outburst and the next Rband pointing was performed more than six weeks later\non August 04. Thus, a decay of the source could not be\nmonitored. A faint (R=21.3) persistent point source was\nfound at the position of the transient in images taken\nbefore and after the outburst. The ROSAT All-sky survey did not show a source at the position of J132813.7214237 at 3\u03c3 flux upper limit of 5.5\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nSimilarly, no counterpart was found in the SIMBAD and\nNED databases. The object is visible near the limiting\nmagnitude of the DSS in the B and R-band and not detected in the DSS I-band. A detailed analysis revealed\nthat the transient source was offset by \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 8 from the position of the persistent counterpart (Fig. 7). This might\nsuggest an extragalactic origin of the transient assuming\nthe persistent counterpart can be associated with a candidate host galaxy. Nevertheless, this vague assumption\nbased on the available observational data requires a confirmation by an accurate distance measurement.\n\nThe lacking observational coverage of the decay light\ncurve of J132813.7-214237 leaves the identification of the\norigin of the source an open question. Assuming the exName\nBrightness [mag]\nPutative\ntraggalactic nature of the faint persistent source, the flarmin\nmax\nclassification\nJ132653.8-212702\n20.3\u00b10.1 19.5\u00b10.1 CV, eclip. binary ing source could, for instance, be associated with a supernova explosion occuring in this galaxy.

Furthermore, J132813.7-214237 might be a potenhttp://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/\n7\ntial orphan afterglow. In order to test this hypothesis we\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n8\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gcvsnsvars.html searched for triggered GRBs which occurred during the\n9\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss form\ntime between the preceding observation (June 18.05 UT)\n\n\f6\n\nA.

We found 5 cataloged10 GRBs during\nthis period (BATSE #7609 & 7610 and IPN #2066, 2067\n& 2069; K.Hurley, private communication). None of those\nhas a position consistent with J132813.7-214237 which\nallows to exclude an association with a triggered GRB.\nRegardless, J132813.7-214237 can also be due to an untriggered or orphan afterglow and is the best such candidate found during our survey.\n\n3.1.3. J161953.3+031909\nThis candidate was detected as a constant source\n(R=19.9) during the first four observations of the field F4\nin May and June 1999 and exhibited a sudden brightening by \u2206R=2.4 mag between the pointings on June 14.29\nUT (MJD 51343.2950 ) and June 17.14 UT (Fig. 5c).\nThe following observation on June 19.15 UT showed the\nsource unchanged and later observations indicate a subse10\n\nhttp://grbcat.gsfc.nasa.gov/grbcat/grbcat.html\n\nquent decay over 50\u201390 days back to the quiescent brightness. The optical light curve suggests the classification of\nJ161953.3+031909 as a dwarf nova. This is strengthened\nby the detection of a faint X-ray source in the ROSAT\nall-sky survey. During an exposure of 320 sec on August\n12/13, 1990 a total of 9 source photons were detected,\ncorresponding to a mean vignetting-corrected count rate\nof 0.033 cts s\u22121 (this is below the significance threshold\nof the all-sky survey catalog, so this source is not contained in the 1RXS catalog of Voges et al. 1999). Adopting\na thermal bremsstrahlung model with 1 keV temperature\nand half of the Galactic foreground absorption, an unabsorbed flux in the 0.1-2.4 keV band of (7.0\u00b11.0)\u00d710\u221213 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 (or (9\u00b12)\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 bolometric) is\nderived. Using the quiescent optical brightness, this implies a ratio of LX /Lopt = 0.6, consistent with SU UMa\nstars (Verbunt et al 1997). With an X-ray luminosity of\n1.1\u00d71032 [D/1 kpc] erg s\u22121 , the implied distance is of order\n\n\fA.

North is up and East to the left.\na few hundred parsec. No entry was found in the SIMBAD\nand NED databases.\n\n3.1.4. J215406.6-274226\nThis source was initially detected in two epochs of the field\nF7 as a faint object with R=22.5 (Fig. 5d). On June 14.41\nUT 1999 (MJD 51343.4150) it was found \u2206R=1.9 mag\nbrighter than previously measured. Fortunately, during\nthis night four images of the field were taken and the rapid\nfading of J215406.6-274226 by \u2206R=0.7 mag in around\n20 min, corresponding to a decay with t\u22121 , was discovered\n(inset of Fig. 5d). Unfortunately, the further fading could\nnot be monitored as the position of the source fell into the\ngap between two CCDs for the following twelve pointings.\nWhile the rapid decay would be consistent with the obser-\n\nvations of early GRB afterglows, also a flare star offers a\npossible explanation. Given the range of absolute magnitudes for nearby M-dwarfs of MV =12\u201316 (Reid et al. 1995)\nthe observed quiescent brightness would place J215406.6274226 at a distance of 0.2\u20131.2 kpc. No X-ray or optical\ncounterpart was detected in the ROSAT All-Sky survey\nand SIMBAD or NED, respectively. No source is detected\nin the DSS B and R-band images but a faint source (\u223c7\u03c3)\nis visible in the DSS I-band. The quiescent counterpart\ncould not be resolved and further observational effort is\nrequired for a more solid classification of the object.\n\n4. Efficiency for Orphan Afterglow Detection\nThe detection efficiency for on-axis optical afterglows was\nestimated using a set of Monte-Carlo simulations folded\n\n\f8\n\nA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\nFig. 7. left: Image of J132813.7-214237 (center source)\nand a nearby bright star from an observation taken on\nMay 23.00 UT when the source had a brightness of R=21.\nFlux contours are overplotted for both objects. North is\nup and East to the left. right: Same field observed on\nJune 20.07 UT together with the flux contours from May\n23.00 UT. The flaring source shows an offset of \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 8 with\nrespect to the quiescent counterpart.\n\nwith the observing schedule of the survey. We simulated\nafterglows with random sky coordinates, light curve parameters and explosion times distributed over the periods\nin which observations were taken. For all afterglows with\npositions inside one of the monitored fields, the expected\nmagnitudes of the afterglows in the first and second observation of the field after the burst were calculated.\nThe afterglow light curves were described by a broken\npower law and parametrized by the pre-break slope, \u03b11 ,\nbreak time, tb , post-break slope, \u03b12 and initial R-band\nmagnitude, Rin . Here, the initial magnitude corresponds\nto the observer frame R-band brightness with which an afterglow is created in the simulations. We used the parameter ranges of 38 observed optical afterglow light curves\nsummarized in Zeh et al. (2005). A relatively flat decay\nplus a steeper flux decrease after the jet break is typically\nobserved for optical afterglows associated with detected\nlong-duration GRBs and is also expected for on-axis orphans as well as \"regular\" afterglows of untriggered bursts.\nAs described earlier, off-axis orphans will show a different\nbehavior. They are expected to be fainter than on-axis orphans at early times and follow the post-break decay of onaxis afterglows after an initial phase of re-brightening. It\nappears safe to assume that on-axis afterglows will be the\nmajority at a limiting magnitude of R=19\u201321 and off-axis\norphans will dominate only at lower magnitudes (Nakar\n& Piran 2003). As the survey strategy foresees to consider\nonly sources as candidate orphans with at least two detections spaced by two nights, off-axis orphans with maximum brightness of R>21 will in most cases be to faint to\nbe identified. While bright off-axis orphans could in principle have been detected in the survey, we do not include\nthem in the simulations and focus solely on untriggered\nand on-axis orphans.\n\nThe expected number of detected afterglows in the\nsurvey depends on the choices for \u03b11 , \u03b12 , tb and Rin .\nThe ranges for the slopes and break time were obtained\nfrom observed light curves (Zeh et al. 2005). Accordingly,\nwe used Gaussian distributions for \u20131.8<\u03b11<\u20130.4 and \u2013\n2.8<\u03b12 <\u20131.4 and an uniform distribution for tb ranging\nfrom 0.4\u20134 days. The most influencing parameter for the\noutcome of the simulations is the initial magnitude of\na candidate afterglow. Rapid optical follow-up observations of BATSE bursts with LOTIS and ROTSE-I (Park\net al. 1999; Akerlof et al. 2000; Kehoe et al. 2001) and recent Swift/UVOT detections indicated that the preponderance of early afterglows does not get brighter than\nR\u223c14. Furthermore, HETE-2 follow-up and UVOT observations showed that around 50 % of the afterglows might\nbe brighter than R\u223c18.5 for 30 minutes after the burst\n(e.g., Lamb et al. 2004).\nIn order to test the influence of the limits of Rin on the\nexpected number of afterglows in the survey, we performed\ntwo simulations with 106 bursts per year and full sky,\neach. The initial magnitudes were uniformly distributed\nbetween 9<Rin <20 and 13<Rin <23, respectively. In addition, a distribution proportional to 0.2\u00d7Rin in the range of\n13<Rin <23 was simulated. The latter corresponds to the\nobservations of afterglows presented in Zeh et al. (2005)\nand is expected to reproduce the reality more closely than\nan uniform distribution. Each simulation was repeated 103\ntimes and the mean detection rates at a given R-band\nmagnitude were obtained.\nThe results of the simulations are presented in\nFigure 8. Here we show the normalized (devided by the\ntotal number of simulated events) probability for a firsttime detection of a simulated afterglow brighter than a\ngiven magnitude. The normalized probability represents\nthe chance to detect the afterglow in a simulation with\none single event over the year and full sky. The expectation for a second observation of a candidate afterglow for\nthe model with non-uniform distribution of Rin is included\nas well. Naturally, the probability to detect an afterglow\nincreases with the depth of the survey. More transients\nare expected to be detected above a certain magnitude\nfor afterglow models with brighter Rin . Due to the lower\nnumber of bright afterglows and the increasing probability\nwith diminishing initial brightness, the non-uniform distribution gives the lowest expectation rates. At the limiting magnitude of the survey of R\u223c23 the probability to\ndetect a specific randomly selected afterglow in at least\none observation is approximately 3\u00d710\u22127 . The detection\nrate of events in at least two consecutive observations is\nlower by a factor of \u223c3. In the more optimistic models, the\nprobability for a single detection reaches up to 2\u00d710\u22126.\n\n5. Discussion\nThe Monte Carlo simulations described in the previous\nsection provide us with the number of afterglows (per year\nand full sky), NMC , which correspond to the probability of identifying one event in two consecutive observa-\n\n\fA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\nFig. 8. Probability distributions for the detection of a randomly selected afterglow for three different models of the\ninitial brightness. The dotted and dashed functions represent uniform distributions of Rin =9\u201320 and Rin =13\u201323,\nrespectively. The thick and thin solid lines correspond to\nthe first-time and second-time observations for a distribution proportional to 0.2\u00d7Rin in the range of Rin =13\u201323.\nThe vertical dotted line marks the limiting magnitude of\nthe presented survey.\ntions of the survey. For the three tested afterglow parameterizations we find values between NMC =1.5\u00d7106 and\nNMC =1\u00d7107.\nThroughout the survey, four unidentified optical transients were discovered and one of these sources shows\nindications for an extragalactic origin (see Sect. 3.1.2).\nNevertheless, the flaring of the source was only detected in\na single observation and thus the fading could not be monitored. An unambiguous identification of the transient with\na GRB afterglow is therefore not possible which leaves us\nwith the result of having no clear orphan or untriggered\nafterglow detected in the data. Therefore, NMC obtained\nfrom the simulations can be interpreted as an upper limit\non the true number of on-axis afterglows per year and full\nsky. For N >NMC one or more on-axis orphans would have\nbeen expected in the data.\nAs advertised earlier, on-axis orphan afterglows can be\nused to place a constraint on the collimation of the optical afterglow emitting region relative to the collimation\nof the \u03b3-ray emitting jet. The collimation factor, fc , corresponds to the ratio of the true rates of on-axis optical\nafterglows, NA , and long-duration GRBs which produce\nobservable optical afterglows, N\u03b3 , pointed at the Earth.\nWith NMC >NA , an upper limit for the collimation can\nbe derived from fc <NMC /N\u03b3 . Obtaining N\u03b3 is not trivial as several uncertain factors influence the number of\nGRBs for which afterglows are in principle detectable. In\na simplified model N\u03b3 can be written as\nN\u03b3 = N\u03b3,obs * fX * fD * fS\n\n(1)\n\nwhere N\u03b3,obs is the observed rate of long-duration\nGRBs with a specific \u03b3-ray instrument corrected for sky\n\n9\n\ncoverage, Earth-blockage and instrument down-time fX\ncorrects for events outside the instrument's energy range,\nfD is the correction factor for optically dim or dark afterglows of long-duration bursts (e.g., intrinsically faint,\nabsorbed, high-z) and fS corrects for possible afterglows\nassociated with short bursts. Using the full sky GRB\nrate measured with BATSE of \u223c666 yr\u22121 (Paciesas et al.\n1999) and correcting for the ratio of long to short bursts\n(2:1; Kouveliotou et al. 1993), we obtain N\u03b3,obs \u223c444. The\nHETE-2 population of high energy bursts revealed a composition of X-ray flashes (Heise et al. 2001), X-ray rich\nbursts and \"normal\" GRBs in equal parts (Lamb et al.\n2005). X-ray flashes and X-ray rich bursts show similar\nafterglows as observed for GRBs but have softer prompt\nemission spectra. As BATSE was less sensitive at lower\nenergies than HETE-2 a fraction of these events might\nhave been missed. This could require a correction factor\nas large as fX =2.\nIn general, not for all rapidly followed GRBs an associated optical transient can be found. Some detected\nafterglows were faint already early on and would have\nfallen below the limiting magnitude reached in our survey. The fraction of these events was found to be of the\norder of 10 % (e.g., Lamb et al. 2004; Jakobsson et al. 2004;\nRol et al. 2005) which provides fD \u223c0.9. Only recently the\nfirst optical transients of short-duration GRBs were found\n(Price et al. 2005; Gal-Yam et al. 2005). Theory and observations hint that these afterglows are significantly fainter\nthan the counterparts of long-duration bursts. Therefore,\nwe neglect the influence of short burst afterglows and apply fS =1 (as we also subtracted them from the burst rate\nof BATSE).\nUsing the assumptions discussed above together with\nNMC =1\u00d7107 we derive N\u03b3 \u223c800 and fC <12500 accordingly. This rather conservative upper limit is significantly\nhigher than the beaming correction derived by Guetta\net al. (2005) and Frail et al. (2001) of 75\u00b125 and 500, respectively. The \u03b3-ray beaming factor corresponds to the\nratio of the overall rate of GRBs to the detected burst\nrate and should be an upper limit for fC (corresponding\nto the case of isotropic afterglow radiation).\nThe high upper limit on fC shows that the effective\ncoverage of the performed observations were not sufficient\nto provide a strong constraint for the collimation. An approximately 25 times larger portion of the sky (\u223c325 deg2 )\nwould have been required to reduce fc to less than 500,\nassuming no orphan afterglow detection. We performed a\nfurther Monte Carlo simulation in order to estimate the\nproperties for an \"ideal\" survey assuming a schedule of one\nobservation per field every two nights over 150 nights with\na limiting magnitude of R=23. We find that fC <500 (<75,\n<10) would be reached with such a configuration and a\n50 deg2 (300 deg2 , 2500 deg2 ) field. Although ambituous, a\nprogram like this is in the range of the near-future instrumentation (e.g., VLT Survey Telescope, Visible & Infrared\nSurvey Telescope for Astronomy) which encourages to perform a comprehensive search for untriggered GRBs in the\nnear future. In addition, spectroscopic follow-up observa-\n\n\f10\n\nA. Rau et al.: Constraining the GRB Collimation\n\ntions of candidate orphans would be important to distinguish between afterglows and other optical transients.\nThe non-detection of an afterglow also provides a limit\non the rate of other explosive events with similar fading\nbehaviour. This includes events with minor or quashed\nhigh energy emission like failed GRBs (Huang et al. 2002)\nor so-called \"dirty fireballs\" (Dermer et al. 1999).\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe presented the data reduction, analysis and results of an\nR-band survey dedicated to slowly variable optical transients. The survey strategy was designed specifically to\nsearch for afterglows of untriggered gamma-ray bursts.\n12 deg2 were monitored in up to 25 nights down to a limiting magnitude of R=23. Throughout the survey, four previously unknown transients were discovered. Based on the\nlimited photometric data only putative classifications of\nthe candidates could be obtained so far. The observations\nof three of the transients suggest them to be a cataclysmic\nvariable, a flare star and a dwarf nova, respectively.\nThe fourth transient appeared in a single image as a\nbright source slightly offset with respect to an underlying quiesent object. The decay of the source could not\nbe followed due to the lack of observations, thus the orgin of the transient is unresolved. However, the spatial\nassociation with the persistent source suggests an extragalatic origin. The steep brightness increase of \u223c1.5 mag in\n\u223c2 days appears a-typical for a supernova and thus makes\nthe detected flaring source the best candidate for an orphan afterglow in our survey.\nSimulations of the transient detection efficiency of the\nsurvey showed that the effective sky coverage was not\nsufficient to obtain a strong constraint on the collimation of the optically emitting GRB outflow from the nondetection of suitable counterparts. Nevertheless, we found\nthat a similar programs like the one described in this paper are feasible to be performed in the near future. Limits\non the collimation ratio of the X-ray to gamma-ray emitting regions were already obtained in the past and strong\nratios (>8) were ruled out (Grindlay 1999; Greiner et al.\n2000). Tighter constraints on the optical emitting region\nwill become available soon as well with the use of large\ndedicated surveys.\nAcknowledgments.
