Although electrical\ndetections of spin transport in Si conduction channels\nwere demonstrated by two research groups,[4, 5] an insulating Al2 O3 tunnel barrier between FM and Si was\nutilized for efficient spin injection and/or detection. To\nrealize gate-tunable spin devices, e.g., spin metal-oxidesemiconductor field effect transistors (spin MOSFET),[8]\ndemonstrations of electrical spin injection and detection\nin Si conduction channels using Schottky tunnel-barrier\ncontacts will become considerably important.[9, 10]\nBy low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy\n(LTMBE), we recently demonstrated highly epitaxial growth of a binary Heusler alloy Fe3 Si on Si and\nobtained an atomically abrupt heterointerface.[11]\nIn this letter, inserting a heavily doped n+ -Si layer\nnear the abrupt interface between Fe3 Si and n-Si, we\nachieve an effective Shottky tunnel barrier for spin\ninjection into Si. Using nonlocal signal measurements,\nwe demonstrate electrical injection and detection of\nspin-polarized electrons in Si conduction channels\nthough the Schottky-tunnel-barrier contacts.\nThe n+ -Si layer was formed on n-Si(111) (n \u223c 4.5 \u00d7\n1015 cm\u22123 ) by a combination of the Si solid-phase epitaxy with an Sb \u03b4-doping process,[12] where the carrier\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\nhamaya@ed.kyushu-u.ac.jp\nmiyao@ed.kyushu-u.ac.jp\n\nconcentration of the n+ -Si layer was \u223c 2.3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 ,\ndetermined by Hall effect measurements, and \u223c 10-nmthick non-doped Si layer was grown on the Sb \u03b4-doped\nlayer. Ferromagnetic Fe3 Si layers with a thickness of \u223c\n50 nm were grown by LTMBE at 130 \u25e6 C, as shown in our\nprevious work.[11] The interface between Fe3 Si and n+ Si was comparable to that shown in Ref. 11. To evaluate\nelectrical properties of the Fe3 Si/Si Schottky contacts, we\nfirstly fabricated two different Schottky diodes (\u223c 1 mm\nin diameter) with and without the n+ -Si layer between\nFe3 Si and n-Si. Here, we define these Schottky diodes\nas Diode A (with the n+ -Si layer) and Diode B (without\nthe n+ -Si layer). A schematic illustration of Diode A is\nshown in the inset of Fig. 1(a).\nThe main panel of Fig. 1(a) shows absolute values\nof the current density, |I|, as a function of bias voltage (Vbias ) for both Diode A and B. These characteristics were reproduced for ten devices. A typical rectifying behavior of a conventional Schottky diode is seen for\nDiode B (blue), while we find almost symmetric behavior with respect to Vbias polarity for Diode A (red). For\nspin injection from Fe3 Si directly into Si, the I \u2212 Vbias\ncharacteristic in the reverse bias regime (Vbias < 0) is\nimportant.[2, 13, 14] We note that the reverse-bias |I|\n(|Irev. |) for Diode A is extremely large more than three\norders of magnitude compared to that for Diode B. For\nboth diodes, the temperature-dependent |Irev. | measured\nat Vbias = - 0.3 V is representatively shown in Fig. 1(b) in\norder to discuss transport mechanisms in Vbias < 0. For\nDiode B (blue), |Irev. | (Vbias = - 0.3 V) is significantly\nreduced (more than six orders of magnitude) with decreasing temperature. By an analysis of the Arrehenius\nplot shown in the inset, the thermionic emission electron\ntransport over a Schottky barrier is indicated, in which\nthe Schottky barrier height is estimated to be \u03a6B = 0.61\neV, consistent with our previous study.[11] Using such\ncontacts (without the n+ -Si layer), we can not detect\nspin-polarized carriers electrically due to additional resistance originating from a wide width of the depletion re-\n\n\f2\n\n|I| (A/cm2)\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\nT = 300 K\nDiode A\n\n\u03a6B\n\nn+ -Si\n\nFe3Si\n~ 10 nm\nVbias\nSb \u03b4-doping\n\nn-Si\n\nn-Si\n\nFe3Si\n\nAuSb\n\nDiode B\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n0\n1\nVbias (V)\n\n-1\n\n|Irev. |(A/cm2)\n\n|I|/T 2(A/K2 )\n\n2\n\n(b) 10\n0\n10\n-2\n10\n-4\n10\n-6\n10\n-8\n10\n-10\n10\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nDiode A\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n\u03a6B ~ 0.61 eV\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n3\n\n5.0\n\nDiode B\n\n1000/T (10 /K)\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) I \u2212 V characteristics of the fabricated Fe3 Si/Si(111) Schottky diodes at 300 K.

(b) Temperature dependence of |I| for the two different diodes at Vbias = - 0.3 V. The inset shows an Arrhenius\nplot for Diode B.\n\ngion (\u223c 500 nm).[2, 14] In contrast, we identify that |Irev. |\nfor Diode A (red) shows almost no variation with decreasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 1(b), indicating that\nthermionic emission does not dominate. For Fe/AlGaAs\nheterostructures, Hanbicki et al. already achieved Schottky tunnel barriers with a highly-doped interface for an\nefficient spin injection into GaAs.[15] The Fe/AlGaAs\nSchottky tunnel barriers have a very weak insulator-like\ntemperature dependence of the conductance, indicating\nthat the tunnel probability across the barrier is dominated by the Fermi-Dirac distribution of the conduction\nelectron's energy in the Fe and AlGaAs.[16] In a preliminary study, we also observed the similar weak insulatorlike features of the conductance for Fe3 Si/Si Schottky\nbarriers with a highly-doped (\u223c1018 cm\u22123 ) interface. On\nthe other hand, for the present Fe3 Si/Si Schottky barriers\nwith a \u03b4-doped n+ -Si layer (\u223c1019 cm\u22123 ), we could not\nsee the weak insulator-like temperature dependence of\nthe conductance. This may mean that the tunnel barrier\nbecomes very thin and the wave functions of the conduction electrons between the Fe3 Si and Si are nearly\noverlapped. As a consequence, there is almost no influence of temperature on the tunnel probability. Thus, under the reverse-bias conditions, we can expect to achieve\nspin injection via a Schottky tunnel barrier consisting of\nthe epitaxially grown Fe3 Si/Si interface, as schematically\nshown in the left inset of Fig. 1(a).\nUsing the Fe3 Si/Si Schottky-tunnel-barrier contacts,\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) An optical micrograph of the lateral spin device with an n+ -Si layer between Fe3 Si and Si\nfor nonlocal-voltage measurements.

Second, four Fe3 Si/Si contacts were defined by\nthe ion milling, where the Si conduction channel was situated below \u223c 50 nm from the Fe3 Si/Si interfaces [see-Fig.\n2(b)]. Two of the Fe3 Si contacts, 2 and 3, have dimensions of 40 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm2 and 6 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm2 , respectively\n[Fig. 2(a)]. The lateral distance between the contact 2\nand 3 edges is \u223c 4 \u03bcm. To form bonding pads, a 200-nmthick SiO2 thin film was deposited by rf magnetron sputtering at room temperature, and then the contact holes\nwere formed by reactive ion etching. Finally, Au/Ti pads\nwere fabricated by electron beam evaporation and lift-off\nmethods.\nFigures 2(c) and 2(d) display representative nonlocal spin signals (\u2206V /I) as a function of magnetic field\n(B) for two different samples with the n+ -Si layers.\nThe nonlocal voltage measurements, being reliable methods for detecting spin accumulation in a nonmagnetic\n\n\f3\n\n100 m\u03a9\n\n-1000\n\n400\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n300\n\n25 K\n\n\u2206 V / I (m\u03a9)\n\n\u2206 V / I (arb.units)\n\nSample 1\n\n200\n\n30 K\n50 K\n0\nB (Oe)\n\n1000\n\n100\n0\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) The \u2206V /I \u2212 B curves recorded at\nvarious temperatures for Sample 1.

External magnetic fields B were applied parallel\nto the long axis of the Fe3 Si contacts in the film plane.\nHere, we define the two samples presented here as Sample\n1 and Sample 2, and the lateral geometry of Sample 1 is\nalmost identical to that of Sample 2. For Sample 1, hysteretic behavior is clearly obtained but the curve feature\nis somewhat different from that of the previous lateral\nspin valves.[17, 18, 19] It should be noted that very large\n\u2206V /I (\u223c 400 m\u03a9) can be detected at 20 K. On the other\nhand, for Sample 2, we can see a spin-valve-like \u2206V /I \u2212B\ncurve at 2 K, but \u2206V /I is extremely small compared to\nSample 1. For other samples without the n+ -Si layer,\nsuch hysteretic features could not be obtained because of\nthe limitation of the current flow.[2, 14] The hysteretic\nnonlocal signals (\u2206V /I) shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)\nindisputably exhibit the experimental demonstrations of\nelectrical spin injection and detection in Si-based devices\nvia a Schottky tunnel barrier.\nWe now infer that the shape of the \u2206V /I \u2212 B\ncurve is affected by in-plane magnetic anisotropies for\nthe Fe3 Si/Si(111) epilayers.\nFor epitaxially grown\nFe3 Si/Ge(111) layers, we found that there is a strong\nin-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with a randomoriented easy axis.[20] In addition, it is well known that\nsuch complicated in-plane anisotropies can affect in-plane\nmagnetic configurations for epitaxially grown ferromagnetic thin films in various external magnetic fields.[21, 22]\nNamely, if the applied field direction, which is nearly parallel to the long axis of the wire-shaped Fe3 Si injector\nand detector, is deviated from its magnetic easy axis, we\ncould not get precise parallel and anti-parallel configurations at zero field and at a magnetization switching field,\nrespectively. These influences are probably related to the\nshape of the \u2206V /I \u2212 B curve for Sample 1. As we can\naccidentally obtain a sample with the wire-shaped Fe3 Si\noriented along the in-plane easy axis, we can see a spinvalve-like \u2206V /I \u2212 B curve,[23] as shown in Fig. 2(d)\n(Sample 2).\nNext, we focus on uneven characteristics of the \u2206V /I\n\nmagnitude. The \u2206V /I magnitude is known to decrease\nwith decreasing the interface resistance between ferromagnets and nonmagnets. According to a simple onedimensional spin-diffusion model,[24] the spin accumulation voltage is roughly proportional to the square of the\ninterface resistance when the interface resistance is much\nsmaller than the spin resistance of the nonmagnets.[25]\nWe confirmed that the interface resistance for Sample 2\nis quite low more than two orders of magnitude compared to that for Sample 1. Therefore, the reduction of\nthe \u2206V /I magnitude for Sample 2 is probably caused by\nthe low interface resistance, resulting in a low efficiency\nof the spin injection. The precise origin of the dispersion of the interface resistance is still unclear, but the\nlocal inhomogeneity of the doped Sb ionization near the\nFe3 Si/Si interface and the damage due to the device fabrication processes may influence crucially for each sample.\nBecause of such local and slight inhomogeneous carrier\nconcentration, we can speculate a small change in the\ntemperature dependence of the interface resistance. This\nsensitive change has already been confirmed by a comparison of characteristics for diode structures (\u223c 1 mm\nin diameter) with a highly-doped (\u223c1018 cm\u22123 ) interface\nand a \u03b4-doped n+ -Si (\u223c1019 cm\u22123 ) interface, as described\nabove.\nFigures 3(a) and 3(b) show temperature dependence\nof the \u2206V /I \u2212 B curve and \u2206V /I, respectively, for Sample 1. The \u2206V /I \u2212 B hysteresis and \u2206V /I are significantly decayed with increasing temperature, and disappear completely at 50 K. We also explored the \u2206V /I\nsignal for various temperatures for Sample 2, but the\nhysteretic \u2206V /I \u2212B feature disappeared at 4 \u223c 10 K unfortunately (not shown here). If the highly efficient spin\ninjection into Si is realized, we can see spin transport at\nhigher temperatures because Si has a long spin-diffusion\nlength. However, the laterally fabricated spin devices include still some problems such as the dispersion of the\ninterface resistance, as stated in previous paragraph. We\ninfer that the decays of the \u2206V /I \u2212 B curve and \u2206V /I\nare probably caused by a slight decrease in the interface\nresistance to rising temperature unfortunately, in which\nthe decrease in the interface resistance reduces the efficiencies of the spin injection and detection. Thus, it is\nstill insufficient that the efficiency of the spin injection\nand detection at the Fe3 Si/Si interface of the present devices. Further optimization of the \u03b4-doping technique,\ndevice fabrication processes, and the device geometry, is\nrequired to observe the spin transport in Si at higher\ntemperatures.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated electrical injection and detection of spin-polarized electrons in silicon\nusing epitaxially grown Fe3 Si/Si Schottky-tunnel-barrier\ncontacts, where a \u03b4-doped n+ -Si layer (\u223c 1019 cm\u22123 )\nis inserted near the interface between a ferromagnetic\nFe3 Si contact and a Si channel (\u223c 1015 cm\u22123 ). By fabricating lateral four-probe geometries with the modified\nFe3 Si/Si contacts, we detected nonlocal output signals\nwhich originate from the spin accumulation in a Si chan-\n\n\f4\nnel at low temperatures. To get a spin device with hightemperature operation, we need further optimizations of\nthe \u03b4-doping technique, device fabrication processes, and\nthe device geometry.\nK.H. and M.M. wish to thank Prof. Y.
