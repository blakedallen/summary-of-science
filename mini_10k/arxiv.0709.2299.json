We study the prospects for detecting gamma-rays from decaying Dark\nMatter (DM), focusing in particular on gravitino DM in R-parity breaking vacua.\nGiven the substantially different angular distribution of the predicted gamma-ray\nsignal with respect to the case of annihilating DM, and the relatively poor (of order\n0.1\u25e6 ) angular resolution of gamma-ray detectors, the best strategy for detection is in\nthis case to look for an exotic contribution to the gamma-ray flux at high galactic\nlatitudes, where the decaying DM contribution would resemble an astrophysical extragalactic component, similar to the one inferred by EGRET observations. Upcoming\nexperiments such as GLAST and AMS-02 may identify this exotic contribution and\ndiscriminate it from astrophysical sources, or place significant constraints on the mass\nand lifetime of DM particles.\n\n1. Introduction\nA tremendous theoretical and experimental effort is in progress to clarify the nature of\nthe elusive Dark Matter that appears to dominate the matter density of the Universe [1,\n2]. The most studied DM candidates are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, that\nachieve the appropriate relic density by freezing-out of thermal equilibrium when their\nself-annihilation rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate of the Universe. The\ncharacteristic mass of these particles is O(100) GeV, and the most representative\nand commonly discussed candidates in this class of models are the supersymmetric\nneutralino, and the B(1) particle, first excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson, in\ntheories with Universal Extra Dimensions. These particle are and will be searched for\nvia collider, direct and indirect searches. In particular, the latter are based on the very\nsame mechanism that controls the relic density of DM, i.e., self-annihilations. In fact,\nalthough the annihilation rate in the local Universe is on average severely suppressed,\nit can still be extremely high at the centre of dense DM halos, since it is proportional\nto the square of the DM particles number density. The prospects for indirect detection\nof annihilating DM have been extensively discussed (see [1, 2] and references therein).\nHowever, self-annihilating relics are not the only DM candidates, and indirect DM\nsearches are not only relevant for self-annihilating particles. Three of us have recently\nstudied an excellent DM candidate, the gravitino in R-parity breaking vacua, that can\n\n\fGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n\n2\n\nachieve the appropriate relic density through the thermal production in the early hightemperature phase of the Universe, and that naturally leads to a cosmological history\nconsistent with thermal leptogenesis and primordial nucleosynthesis [3].\nSince R-parity is broken, gravitinos can decay into a photon and a neutrino [4],\nalthough with a lifetime that, being suppressed both by the Planck mass and by the small\nR-parity breaking parameters, is naturally much longer than the age of the Universe [5].\nSimilarly, for sufficiently small R-parity breaking, also neutralinos [6, 7] and axinos [8]\nare dark matter candidates which can decay into a photon and a neutrino. These\nscenarios thus predict a diffuse flux of photons and neutrinos that, by comparison with\nexisting observational data, can be used to set constraints on the mass and lifetime of\nthe decaying particles. Interestingly, an excess in the galactic component of the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux measured by EGRET has been claimed in Ref. [9], at energies between\n1 and 10 GeV. A more careful analysis of the Galactic foreground has led Strong et\nal. to a new estimate of the extra-galactic component [10] with a significantly different\nspectrum with respect to the previous analysis. More recently, Stecker et al. [11] pointed\nout a possible error in the energy calibration of EGRET above 1 GeV, a circumstance\nthat if confirmed would make any interpretation of EGRET data in terms of exotic\ncomponents, such as DM annihilation or decay, unreliable, if not meaningless.\nIn view of these and other systematic uncertainties [12], we will not try here to\nfit the EGRET data with the gamma-ray flux produced by decaying DM, although\nwe regard this coincidence as interesting and deserving further attention. We perform\ninstead a careful analysis of the signal that might be detected with the next generation of\ngamma-ray experiments. Similar analyses has previously been carried out for decaying\nDM candidates with masses in the keV range, such as a scalar modulus [13] or a sterile\nneutrino [14, 15]. More recently also the case of small mass splittings and heavy DM\ndecaying into MeV photons has been discussed in order to explain the COMPTEL excess\nin the photon flux [16, 17].\nUnlike the case of stable neutralinos and other WIMPs, the rate at which gravitinos\nproduce photons is proportional to the density of DM particles, as appropriate for\ndecaying DM particles, not to the square of the DM density. As a consequence, the\nstrategies for indirect detection must keep into account the different angular distribution\nof the predicted signal, and the different ratio between galactic and extra-galactic\ncontributions. Although the situation is very similar to the case of other decaying\nDM candidates, such as decaying sterile neutrinos, the angular resolution of experiments\nsensitive to photons from decaying gravitinos, typically above 5 GeV [3], are much worse\nthan X-ray telescopes, relevant for sterile neutrinos. Here we study the best strategies\nto detect an exotic component in the gamma-ray diffuse flux with future experiments\nsuch as the upcoming gamma-ray satellite GLAST, scheduled for launch in the next few\nmonths, and with AMS-02. Although in our analysis we adopt gravitinos as our fiducial\nDM candidates, our results can be applied to any decaying DM particle in a similar\nrange of masses into monochromatic photons.\nThe paper is organised as follows: in Sec. 2 we discuss our expectation for\n\n\f3\n\nGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n\ngravitino lifetime and the decay channel, while in Sec. 3 the Galactic and extra-galactic\ncontributions to the gamma-ray flux from gravitino decays. In Sec. 4 we consider\nalternative targets for indirect detection such as dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters. In\nSec. 5 we discuss our results and compare the indirect detection strategies of decaying\nand self-annihilating DM. Finally we give our conclusions in Sec. 6.\n2. Gravitino decay\nAs is the case for the proton, we do not know if the DM particle is absolutely stable. In\nthe case of supersymmetric candidates, usually R-parity is invoked to make the proton\nsufficiently long-lived and it automatically gives that the Lightest Supersymmetric\nParticle (LSP) is stable. On the other hand R-parity is not the only possibility for\nprotecting the proton from rapid decay and a small amount of R-parity violation does\nnot rule out the possibility of having supersymmetric DM if the LSP is very weakly\ninteracting with the R-parity violating sector or the decay is highly suppressed by\nphase space. As an example, in [3], we have considered a supersymmetric extension\nof the standard model with small R-parity and lepton number violating couplings and\na gravitino LSP. The model predicts a small photino-neutrino mixing |U\u03b3\u0303\u03bd | = O(10\u22128 ),\nwhich leads to the decay of the gravitino into photon and neutrino [5],\n\u0393(\u03c83/2\n\nm33/2\n1\n2\n.\n|U\u03b3\u0303\u03bd |\n\u2192 \u03b3\u03bd) =\n32\u03c0\nMP 2\n\n(1)\n\nUsing MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV, one obtains for the gravitino lifetime\n2\u2212body\n\u03c43/2\n\n|U\u03b3\u0303\u03bd |\n\u2243 3.8 \u00d7 10 s\n10\u22128\n27\n\n!\u22122 \u0012\n\nm3/2\n10 GeV\n\n\u0013\u22123\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nAt tree level this decay channel can be suppressed if the sneutrino v.e.v. responsible\nfor the photino-neutrino mixing is very small, but even if the mixing vanishes, the\ndecay can take place via one loop diagrams. The loop induced decay has been recently\ncomputed in [18], where it has been shown that also in this case the channel dominates\nover the 3-body decay into fermions [19] for small gravitino masses. For this reason\nwe will concentrate on this particular channel and will assume in the following that our\nDark Matter candidate decays into a photon and neutrino producing two monochromatic\nlines at energy equal to mDM /2 with a lifetime of the order of 1027 s or larger. On the\nother hand, if the gravitino is sufficiently heavy it could decay into W or Z bosons,\nproducing through fragmentation a continuous spectrum of photons with a characteristic\nshape [20]. The neutrino flux in the few GeVs energy range is unfortunately overwhelmed\nby the atmospheric neutrino background and so its detection seems much more difficult\nthan that of the gamma-ray flux.\nNote that the signal in gammas would be the same, only twice as strong, for the\ncase of a scalar DM candidate decaying into two photons.\n\n\f4\n\nGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n3. Gamma-Rays from DM decay\n\nIf the DM particles decay all around us, we expect two sources for a diffuse background.\nWe have the DM decaying in the Milky Way halo nearby and in addition those decaying\nat cosmological distances.\nLet us first consider the latter ones, which have been more intensively studied\nin the literature [5, 21]. The decay of DM into photon and neutrino at cosmological\ndistances gives rise to a perfectly isotropic extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray flux with a\ncharacteristic energy spectrum, corresponding to a red\u2013shifted monochromatic line. A\nphoton with measured energy E = m3/2 /(2(1 +qz)) has been emitted at the comoving\ndistance \u03c7(z), with d\u03c7/dz = (1 + z)\u22123/2 /(a0 H0 \u03a9M (1 + \u03ba(1 + z)\u22123 )). Here a0 and H0\nare the present scale factor and Hubble parameter, respectively, and \u03ba = \u03a9\u039b /\u03a9M \u2243 3,\nwith \u03a9\u039b + \u03a9M = 1, assuming a flat universe. Then we obtain for the photon flux\n2\ndJeg\n= Aeg\ndE\nmDM\n\n2E\n1+\u03ba\nmDM\n\u0012\n\n\u00133 !\u22121/2 \u0012\n\n2E\nmDM\n\n\u00131/2\n\n2E\n\u0398 1\u2212\nmDM\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n, (3)\n\nwith\nAeg =\n\n\u03a9DM \u03c1c\n\n= 10\u22127 (cm2 s str)\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4DM\n1027 s\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\nmDM\n10 GeV\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n; (4)\n1/2\n4\u03c0\u03c4DM mDM H0 \u03a9M\nhere \u03c4DM is the DM particle lifetime and is given by Eq. (2) for the gravitino case.\nWe have taken the particle density to be equal to the Cold Dark Matter density as\n\u03a9DM h2 = 0.1, and the other constants as \u03c1c = 1.05 h2 \u00d7 10\u22125GeVcm\u22123 , total matter\ndensity \u03a9M = 0.25 and H0 = h 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 with h = 0.73 [22]. We are\nconsidering here \u03c4DM \u226b H0\u22121 so that we can neglect in the above formula the depletion\nof the number density due to the decay.\nIn addition to the extragalactic signal there is an anisotropic sharp line from the\nhalo of our galaxy with an intensity comparable to the extragalactic signal [13]. The\nflux from the decay of halo DM particles is given by the density profile, i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2E\ndJhalo\n,\n(5)\n= Ahalo\n\u03b4 1\u2212\ndE\nmDM\nmDM\nwhere\nZ\n1\nAhalo =\n\u03c1halo (~l)d~l .\n(6)\n4\u03c0\u03c4DM mDM l.o.s.\nThe ratio Ahalo /Aeg only depends on cosmological parameters and the halo dark matter\ndensity integrated along the line of sight \u2021. Hence, the intensity and angular distribution\nof the halo signal is very sensitive to the distribution of the dark matter in the Milky\nWay. Surprisingly, for typical halo models, this ratio is of order unity [13].\nConsider a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the DM matter of our galaxy,\n\u03c1h\n(7)\n\u03c1N F W (r) =\nr/rc (1 + r/rc )2\n\u2021 The coefficients Ahalo and Aeg are related to the coefficients C\u03b3 and D\u03b3 in our previous paper [3]\nby a factor 2/m3/2 . Let us also note that in that reference there is a typo in the definition of C\u03b3 : it\nshould say 10\u22127 instead of 10\u22126 .\n\n\f5\n\nGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n\nFigure 1. Left: EGRET diffuse emission in the energy range E=[4,10] GeV. Right:\nSum of the Galactic plus extra-galactic contributions to the gamma-ray flux from\ngravitino decay, for \u03c4DM = 4 \u00d7 1027 s and mDM = 10 GeV and the NFW profile given\nin Eq.

For any given point along the\nline of sight, the distance r from the centre of the galaxy can be expressed as function\nof the galactic coordinates, the longitude l and latitude b, and the distance from the\nSun s in units of R\u2299 as\nh\n\ni\n\n2\nr 2 (s, b, l) = R\u2299\n(s \u2212 cos b cos l)2 + (1 \u2212 cos2 b cos2 l) .\n\nThe flux factor then reads\n\n(8)\n\n\u221e\nR\u2299\nds \u03c1N F W (r(s, b, l)) .\n(9)\n4\u03c0\u03c4DM mDM 0\nThis expression can be used to give the flux dependence on the angle, as long as we\nare far away from the central cusp. In that region a more appropriate quantity is the\naverage flux on the solid angle corresponding to the detector resolution around the\ndirection (b, l), i.e.\nZ\n1\nd\u03a9 Ahalo (b, l) ,\n(10)\nhAhalo (b, l)i\u2206\u03a9 =\n\u2206\u03a9 \u2206\u03a9\nwhere the infinitesimal solid angle is given by d\u03a9 = dl cos(b)db. We consider therefore\nthe average flux for an angular resolution of 1\u25e6 as measured by EGRET. The result of\nthe numerical integration for the halo flux plus the isotropic extragalactic component\nis shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, which illustrates the decrease of photon flux away\nfrom the galactic centre, both in longitude and latitude. Note that the dependence\nis not very strong and indeed Ahalo changes only by a factor 20 between the galactic\ncentre and the anti-centre, and within a factor of 8 if one cuts out the region within 10\ndegrees around the galactic plane. Averaging over all sky excluding the galactic plane,\nwe obtain Ahalo /Aeg \u2243 0.76, so that the line is actually dominating the signal.

(4) and (6).\nThe expected signal from Dark Matter decay in the halo can be compared with\nthe diffuse gamma-ray flux observed by EGRET. Contour lines of constant flux, with\nphoton energies between 4 GeV and 10 GeV are shown in the right panel of Fig. 1. As\nexpected, the smallest flux is observed in the directions of the north and south poles,\ni.e. orthogonal to the galactic disk. According to Fig. 1, the signal in these directions\nis larger than in the direction opposite to the galactic centre. We therefore conclude\nthat the signal from the MW halo could be most effectively observed looking away from\nthe galactic disk, which generates most of the background, in direction of the poles, in\ncontrast with the strategy usually adopted for the detection of the self-annihilating DM\nsignal.\nThe photon spectrum is dominated by the sharp line coming from our local halo,\nwhile the red-shifted extragalactic signal is appreciably lower. The position of the\nline allows a direct measurement of the DM particle mass and the height is inversely\nproportional to the lifetime. In Fig. 2, we show the expected signal for decaying particle\nmass of 10 GeV and for a lifetime of 1027 s in comparison to the extragalactic EGRET\ndata [9, 10]. We mimic the finite energy resolution of the detector by convolving the\nsignal with a Gaussian distribution and average the halo signal over a cone of 80\u25e6\naround the poles. The height and width of the line depend as usual on the energy\nresolution of the detector; here we have taken 15% as energy resolution, as quoted\nby EGRET in this energy range. Note also that the DM signal peaked at 5 GeV\ncorresponds to the expectation of the model of gravitino LSP with R-parity and B-L\nbreaking discussed in [3]. A word of caution though is in order in the comparison\nbetween data and signal: the EGRET extragalactic background displayed here has been\nextracted assuming isotropy, while our halo emission is mildly anisotropic away from\nthe galactic plane. GLAST is expected to provide much better data at these energies,\nallowing a much more detailed analysis of the angular and spectral properties of the\ndiffuse gamma-ray flux.\n4.

(15); we have also taken a finite\ntidal radius rm into account, which leads to the finite integration domain given by\n2\nr(\u03b1)2 \u2264 rm\n.

The correction due to the finite tidal\nradius in Eq.

The correction factor for finite opening angle in Eq. (19) can only\nbe neglected for \u03b4 < rc /d = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 , which corresponds to the angular resolution\nof GLAST of about 0.1\u25e6 . For \u03b4 \u2243 0.004 the signals from Draco and the halo have\nequal strength, but the corresponding field of view is \u2206\u03a9 \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 , yielding the\nflux \u03a6D (0.004) \u223c 3.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 (cm2 s)\u22121 , too small to be observed even by GLAST [24].\nWe conclude that for dark matter particles with masses in the GeV range the flux\nenhancement in the direction of dwarf galaxies is currently not of interest. This is\ndifferent for masses in the keV range [15] where the flux is six orders of magnitude\nlarger for the same DM density and in which case the angular resolutions of the X-rays\ndetector is much better than for gamma rays.\nAnother potentially important source of gamma rays is the Andromeda Galaxy, due\nto its proximity, large apparent size and privileged position in the sky away from the\nMilky Way centre. To estimate the photon flux received from the Andromeda Galaxy,\nwe approximate the dark matter distribution by the isothermal profile, Eq. (15), with\nM31\nrcM31 = 1.5 kpc, \u03c1M31\n\u2243 15.7 GeV cm\u22123 , rm\n= 117 kpc [25]. The total flux received\n0\nfrom a cone directed toward the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy with a small opening\n\n\f9\n\nGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n\nangle \u03b4 is given by Eq. (19). On the other hand, for the angular resolution of GLAST,\nthe gamma ray flux from the Milky Way halo in the direction to the Andromeda Galaxy\n(bM31 = \u221222\u25e6 , lM31 = 121\u25e6 ) is approximately\n\n\u03c4DM \u22121 mDM \u22121\n.

This is above\nthe sensitivity of detection of GLAST (although below the EGRET sensitivity), hence\nwe conclude that GLAST might be able to see the Andromeda Galaxy as a gamma\nray source over the background from the decaying dark matter in the Milky Way halo.\nHowever, one should also note that the extraction of an extragalactic gamma ray flux at\nsuch low galactic latitudes is intricate, and the Andromeda signal from dark matter decay\ncould be easily masked by photons from standard astrophysical processes occurring in\nthe Milky Way disk.\nFinally, let us discuss other potentially interesting sources of gamma rays, namely\nnearby galaxy clusters located at high galactic latitudes, like Coma or Virgo. The\nphoton flux can be computed along the same lines as for dwarf galaxies, where the\ndensity profile Eq. (15) has to be replaced by the profile for the isothermal \u03b2-model\n[26, 27]\nJhalo (bM31 , lM31 ) \u2243 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 (cm2 s str)\u22121\n\n\u03c1cl = \u03c1cl\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n3 + r 2 /rc2\n,\n(1 + r 2 /rc2 )2\n\n(23)\n\nthat approximately describes the distribution of dark matter in a galaxy cluster.

To be precise, the core of the Coma Cluster has a size of 0.3 Mpc compared to\na distance of 98 Mpc, corresponding to 0.17\u25e6 of angular size, which is larger than the\nangular resolution of GLAST. On the other hand, the Virgo Cluster has a core radius\nof 10 kpc and lies at 18 Mpc, which translate into an angular size of 0.03\u25e6 , slightly\nsmaller than the angular resolution of GLAST. In consequence, for these objects the\nline of sight approximation \u03b4 = 0 is not a good approximation and in order to obtain a\nreliable estimate for the photon flux the complete expression Eq.

Discussion\nShould the gamma-ray line from DM decay be discovered at high galactic latitude, the\nproblem will arise of how to discriminate it from scenarios with self-annihilating DM.\nThe presence of a spectral line in the diffuse signal at high galactic latitude has in fact\nbeen proposed, several years ago, as a signature of annihilating DM particles [28] (see\nalso Refs. [29, 30]). We note however that there are at least four important differences\nbetween the two scenarios:\n\u2022 the angular profile of the predicted gamma-ray signal;\n\n\u2022 the comparison between galactic and extra-galactic components;\n\u2022 the ratio between the line and the gamma-ray continuum;\n\n\u2022 the angular power spectrum of the gamma-ray background.\nWe stress in fact that in the case of self-annihilating DM, the gamma-ray flux from\na given direction in the sky is a steeply falling function of the angle with respect to the\nGalactic centre, and it is in particular much steeper than the flux from decaying DM, as\ncan be seen in Fig. 3. That is precisely why we have focused on high galactic latitudes\nin Sec. 2. Furthermore, the extra-galactic component of the gamma-ray flux in the\ncase of annihilating DM is unlikely to be detected in absence of a strong signal from\nthe Galactic centre [31]. In other words, in order for an extra-galactic component to be\ndetected at high latitudes, the gamma-ray signal from the galactic centre should be easily\ndetectable, despite the much stronger astrophysical background toward the innermost\nregions of the Galaxy. Thus, in case a line is observed at high galactic latitude, the\nabsence of a similar line in the gamma-ray spectrum of the Galactic centre would favour\nan interpretation in terms of decaying DM.\nIt is still possible that astrophysical processes, such as the formation of spikes [32,\n33, 34] and mini-spikes [35, 36, 37], i.e. large DM overdensities around Supermassive\nand Intermediate Mass Black Holes respectively, modify this picture, by boosting\nthe gamma-ray signal from cosmological structures much more than the flux from\nthe Galactic centre [38, 39]. Even in this case, however, it should be possible to\ndiscriminate between the two scenarios, by studying the spectral features of the extragalactic background.

Angular profile of the gamma-ray signal as function of the angle \u03b8 to the\ncentre of the galaxy for a NFW halo distribution for decaying DM, solid (red) line,\ncompared to the case of self-annihilating DM, dashed (blue) line. Both signals have\nbeen normalised to their values at the galactic poles, \u03b8 = \u00b190\u25e6 . The central cusp\nis regularised by assuming in both cases the GLAST angular resolution of 0.1\u25e6 and\nintegrating on the solid angle as in Eq. (10).\n\nDimensions, direct annihilation to photons is severely suppressed with respect to other\nchannels such as annihilation to quarks or gauge bosons. It follows that the annihilation\nspectra are characterised by a continuum emission that is inevitably associated with\nthe line signal, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, masses below 50 GeV are usually\nconsidered unlikely for annihilating candidates. For instance, the current constraint in\nthe neutralino mass is 40 GeV (assuming unification of gaugino mass parameters at\nthe GUT scale) [22] while electroweak precision data exclude B(1) masses below 300\nGeV [40].\nAlthough the relative importance of the line can be in some cases particularly\nhigh, as e.g. in the case of Inert Higgs DM [41], the peculiar shape of the angular\npower spectrum of the gamma-ray background [42] can be used as a diagnostic tool\nto discriminate between annihilating and decaying DM. As for all the other strategies,\nthis method heavily relies on the assumption that a sufficient number of photons are\ncollected above the astrophysical background to allow a statistically meaningful analysis.\nIn the worst case scenario, null GLAST searches can be used to exclude regions of the\nparameter space that lead to observable fluxes.\nIn Fig. 5 we show an exclusion plot in the (mDM , \u03c4DM ) plane, where we show the\nregions of the parameter space that already are ruled out by a comparison with EGRET\ndata.

In our\ncase, there is a considerable reduction of the background, and a not-so-large decrease\nof the signal when going at high galactic latitude, for the reasons discussed above. So\nit is not a surprise that the 'high latitude' region is more favourable for constraining\ndecaying DM. In Fig. 5 we show the reach of GLAST for the two regions along with the\nEGRET-excluded region. For the present bound we take conservatively the requirement\nthat the peak in the energy spectrum with 15% energy resolution remains below the 2\u03c3\nband of the EGRET spectrum obtained by Sreekumar et al. in [9],\n\u22122.1\u00b10.03\nE\ndJEGRET\n.(27)\n= (7.32\u00b10.34)\u00d710\u22126 (cm2 s str GeV)\u22121\ndE\n0.451 GeV\nThe different mass dependence of the EGRET bound is due to the fact that it is a\ndJ\nconstraint on dE\ninstead than on the integrated flux and on the energy dependence of\nthe GLAST sensitivity.

Conclusions\nWe have discussed the prospects for indirect detection of gravitino DM in R-parity\nbreaking vacua with upcoming experiments such as GLAST and AMS-02. The search\nstrategy is in this case significantly different with respect to annihilating DM particles,\ndue to different angular profile of the predicted gamma-ray signal and the different\nrelative importance of the extra-galactic background. We found that the predicted\nsignal from DM decays in the galactic halo would resemble an extra-galactic component\nwith a shape and normalisation similar to the one inferred by EGRET data.\nWithout trying to fit the controversial EGRET data with our model, we have\ndetermined the regions of the (mDM , \u03c4DM ) plane where GLAST could discover the\ngamma-ray line from gravitino decay, and we discussed how to discriminate this signal\nfrom astrophysical sources and from a signal originating from annihilating DM. This\ndiscrimination is based on the fact that: the line may appear at energies below 50\nGeV, which is somewhat challenging for popular annihilating DM candidates; it would\nexhibit no continuum flux (unless the mass of the gravitino is above the W mass); there\nwould be a weak line signal from the galactic centre, possibly hidden in the galactic\nbackground; the angular power spectrum of the signal would be different from the case\nof annihilating DM, and from extra-galactic astrophysical sources.\n\n\fGamma-Rays from Decaying Dark Matter\n\n14\n\nIn the worst case scenario, i.e. in case of null GLAST searches, the data can be\nused to set constraints in the (mDM , \u03c4DM ) plane and improve the bound on the DM\nlifetime into photons by more than one order of magnitude, actually even more than\ntwo for masses below 1 GeV.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank to E.-J.
