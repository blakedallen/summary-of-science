Introduction\nCluster algebras have been the subject of intensive research since their introduction some ten years\nago by Fomin and Zelevinsky [FZ]. The two best-understood families of cluster algebras are those which\nadmit a categorification (as in [BM+, GLS], or, generalizing both, [Ami1, Ami2]), and those which arise\nfrom a surface with boundary ([FST], building on [GSV, FG]). Both these families of cluster algebras\nhave a significant \"2-dimensional\" quality. In the case of the cluster algebras with a categorification,\nthis is present in a certain 2-Calabi-Yau property in the associated category. In the case of cluster\nalgebras arising from surfaces, there is the 2-dimensionality of the surface. It is natural to ask if similar\nconstructions exist in higher dimensions.\nIn order to pursue this question, it is natural to begin by focussing attention on the cluster algebras\nof type An , which fit within both the families of cluster algebras mentioned above. Their categorification\nis based on the representation theory of the path algebra of an An quiver; the surface to which they\ncorrespond is a disk with n + 3 marked points on the boundary. In seeking a higher dimensional cluster\ntheory, one would expect to replace the path algebra by an algebra of higher global dimension, and the\ndisk by some higher dimensional space. The difficulty is to determine appropriate candidates for these\nroles. A reasonable criterion by which to justify such choices would be evidence of similar structures\narising in the higher dimensional algebra and the higher dimensional geometry.\nIn the present paper, we exhibit links along these lines. Our replacement for the path algebra of\nAn is the (d \u2212 1)-fold higher Auslander algebra of the (linearly oriented) path algebra of type An .\n(These higher Auslander algebras were introduced in [Iya]). This is a prototypical d-representation finite\nalgebra. Our work can therefore be viewed as a part of the recent development of the theory of drepresentation finite algebras. This class of algebras, which has been introduced in [IO1], is a natural\ngeneralization of representation finite hereditary algebras. Many higher dimensional analogues of classical\nresults for representation finite hereditary algebras have been shown to hold for this class of algebras (see\n[Iya, IO1, IO2]). Indeed, part of the present paper (Section 5) is carried out for general d-representation\nfinite algebras. There we introduce for such algebras a d-dimensional analogue of the classical cluster\ncategories. It shares many properties of the classical cluster categories, and in particular, there is a well\nbehaved notion of cluster tilting.\nOur replacement for the disk is a 2d-dimensional cyclic polytope. The cyclic polytope C(m, \u03b4) is\na certain polytope in R\u03b4 with m vertices. Cyclic polytopes have been extensively studied in convex\ngeometry, going back to [Car] in 1911. For an introduction, see [Bar, Chapter VI]. A triangulation of\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nC(m, \u03b4) is a subdivision of C(m, \u03b4) into \u03b4-dimensional simplices, each of whose vertices is a vertex of the\npolytope. Triangulations of cyclic polytopes have been studied with a view to extending to that setting\nsome of the rich structure of triangulations of convex polygons (see [KV, ER]) and as a testing-ground for\nmore general convex-geometric conjectures (see [ERR, RaS]). We shall be concerned only with the case\n\u03b4 = 2d is even. We refer to the d-dimensional simplices of C(m, 2d) which do not lie on the boundary\nof C(m, 2d) as the internal d-simplices of C(m, 2d). We will give a new combinatorial description of the\nset of triangulations of C(m, 2d) by characterizing the sets of internal d-simplices of C(m, 2d) which can\narise as the set of internal d-faces of a triangulation. By a result of Dey [Dey], the d-dimensional faces of\nthe triangulation uniquely determine the triangulation.\n1.1. d-representation finite algebras. Iyama has introduced higher dimesional analogues of AuslanderReiten theory and Auslander algebras (see for instance [Iya]), generalizing these classical concepts from\nthe representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. In [IO1] the notion of d-representation finiteness\nwas introduced as an ideal setup for studying these concepts. (See also [Iya, IO2, HI] for further results\nillustrating this philosophy.) In this paper we will mostly focus on the currently best-understood class\nof d-representation finite algebras: the (d \u2212 1)-st higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented An (see\n[Iya, IO1]); these algebras will be called Adn .\nInside the module category of Adn , there is a unique d-cluster tilting module, Adn M . We have the\nfollowing result:\nTheorem 1.1 (see Theorems 3.4 and 4.4). There is a bijection\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\u001a\n\u001b\nindecomposable\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\ninternal d-simplices\nnon-projective-injective\nof C(n + 2d, 2d)\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\ndirect summands of Adn M\n\nwhich induces a bijection\n\u001a\n\ntriangulations of\nC(n + 2d, 2d)\n\n\u001b\n\n\u001a\n\nbasic tilting modules for Adn\ncontained in add Adn M\n\n\u001b\n\nThe case when d = 1 was already understood. Here, the algebra A1n is the path algebra of linearly\nordered An . The 1-cluster tilting module A1n M is an additive generator of the whole module category\nmod A1n . So the d = 1 case of the previous result is the fact that the non-projective-injective indecomposable modules of A1n can be identified with the diagonals of an (n + 2)-gon in such a way that tilting\nmodules for A1n correspond to triangulations.\n1.2. A cluster category. We consider another representation-theoretic setup which is similar but in\nsome ways preferable to the one discussed above. We introduce a higher dimensional cluster category\ncalled O\u039b for any d-representation finite algebra \u039b.\nNote that a different notion of higher cluster category, the d-cluster category CHd , for H a hereditary\nalgebra, has been studied (see [BaM] and references therein). However CHd is not higher dimensional\nin the sense of this paper: CHd is defined for hereditary algebras, it has a two-dimensional AuslanderReiten quiver (see [Iya]) and the combinatorics of its cluster tilting objects is modelled by subdivisions\nof polygons in the plane.\nOur cluster category O\u039b is constructed as a subcategory of the 2d-Amiot cluster category C\u039b2d . 2dAmiot cluster categories are a generalization of classical 2d-cluster categories to not necessarily hereditary\nalgebras \u039b; in particular the categories C\u039b2d are 2d-Calabi-Yau and triangulated. These properties of C\u039b2d\nwill be used to show that O\u039b is (d + 2)-angulated, and also satisfies a certain Calabi-Yau property. It\nshould be noted that for d = 1 the two categories O\u039b and C\u039b2 coincide, and also coincide with the classical\ncluster category of the hereditary representation finite algebra \u039b. For all d-representation finite algebras\n\u039b, the category O\u039b contains only finitely many indecomposable objects, which can be arranged in a\nd-dimensional analogue of an Auslander-Reiten quiver.\nFor the case \u039b = Adn we obtain the following analogue of Theorem 1.1:\nTheorem 1.2 (see Proposition 6.10(1) and Theorem 6.4). There is a bijection\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u001b\nindecomposable\ninternal d-simplices\nobjects in OAdn\nof C(n + 2d + 1, 2d)\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\nwhich induces a bijection\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\ntriangulations of\nC(n + 2d + 1, 2d)\n\n3\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\nbasic cluster tilting\nobjects in OAdn\n\n1.3. Local moves. There are notions of local moves for all of the setups above, that is for triangulations,\ntilting modules, and cluster tilting objects.\nFor triangulations, the local move is called a bistellar flip. It generalizes the operation on triangulations\nof polygons which removes one edge of the triangulation and replaces it by the other diagonal of the\nresulting quadrilateral. We will show that two triangulations S and T of a cyclic polytope C(n + 2d, 2d)\nare related by a bistellar flip if and only if the collections of d-faces of S and T coincide except that there\nis one d-face present in S which is not in T and vice versa.\nThe local move for cluster tilting objects is called mutation; if A and B are distinct indecomposable\nobjects in OAdn , such that A \u2295 T and B \u2295 T are basic cluster tilting objects in OAdn , then there are\nsequences of objects and morphisms\n(1)\n\nA\n\nEd\n\n***\n\nE1\n\nB\n\nB\n\nF1\n\n***\n\nFd\n\nA\n\nand\n(2)\n\n(1) and (2) are called exchange (d+2)-angles; they are distinguished (d+2)-angles in the (d+2)-angulated\nstructure of OAdn . In the d = 1 case these sequences are the usual exchange triangles for classical cluster\ncategories.\nSimilarly there is the notion of mutation of tilting modules contained in add Adn M . In that case one\nhas an exact exchange sequence similar to one of the sequences (1) or (2) (but one has only one sequence,\nnot two).\nOne main result of this paper is that all these notions of local moves coincide in the following way:\nTheorem 1.3 (see Theorems 6.4 and 4.4). Under the bijections of Theorems 1.2 and 1.1 bistellar flips\nof triangulations correspond to mutations of cluster tilting objects and mutations of tilting modules, respectively.\n1.4. Tropical cluster exchange relations. One motivation for this paper is the fact that, in the d = 1\ncase, cluster tilting objects of OA1n (= CA2 1 ), or equivalently triangulations of an (n + 3)-gon, form a\nn\nmodel for the combinatorics of the An cluster algebra in the sense that diagonals of the (n + 3)-gon,\nor equivalently the indecomposamble objects of the cluster category, are in bijection with the cluster\nvariables in the An cluster algebra.\nWe might hope that the internal d-simplices of C(n + 2d + 1, 2d), which are in bijection with the indecomposable objects in the cluster category OAdn , also correspond to \"cluster variables\" in some analogue\nof a cluster algebra. At present, we do not know how this should be interpreted. However, we are able\nto exhibit an analogue of the tropical cluster exchange relations of [GSV, FT] in our setting.\nLet us very briefly recall the tropical cluster algebra of functions on laminations, in the rather special\ncase which is of interest to us. Fix an (n + 3)-gon. A lamination is a collection of lines in the polygon,\nwhich do not intersect, and which begin and end on the boundary of the polygon, and not on any vertex.\nLet L be the set of laminations. For any lamination L \u2208 L, and E any boundary edge or diagonal of the\npolygon, there is a well-defined number of points of intersection between L and E.\nEncode this information by associating to each edge or diagonal A of the polygon, a function IA : L\nN,\nwhere IA (L) is the number of intersections between A and L.\nThese functions satisfy a certain tropical exchange relation, namely, if E, F, G, H are four sides of a\nquadrilateral in cyclic order, and A, B are the two diagonals, then the relation is:\nIA + IB = max(IE + IG , IF + IH )\nThis relation is the tropicalization of the usual cluster relation in type A (in the sense that (\u00d7, +) have\nbeen replaced by (+, max)). Using this relation, and supposing that the functions corresponding to the\nedges of a given starting triangulation (including the boundary edges) are known, one can determine the\nfunction corresponding to an arbitrary diagonal of the polygon.\nFor general d, we define a similar collection of laminations, again denoted L, and define functions\nN for each A a d-simplex of C(n + 2d + 1, 2d) (including boundary d-simplices). These functions\nIA : L\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nsatisfy an exchange relation similar to the tropical exchange relation above. The exchange relation is\nclosely related to the representation-theoretic sequences (1) and (2):\nTheorem 1.4 (see Theorem 7.1). Let A and B be internal d-simplices of C(n + 2d + 1, 2d) such that\nthere exist two triangulations whose d-simplices consists of T \u222a {A} and T \u222a {B}, respectively, for some\nset T .\nThen, if we write IEi for the sum of the IX with X a summand of Ei (and similar for Fi ),\n\u0010X\n\u0011\nX\n(\u22121)d+1 IA + IB = max\n(\u22121)i+1 IFi + boundary terms .\n(\u22121)i+1 IEi + boundary terms,\n\nHere, \"boundary terms\" refers to a sum of terms \u00b1IX with X a boundary d-simplex. Such terms IX\nshould be thought of as coefficients; they are d-faces of every triangulation and, as in the d = 1 case,\nthere are no corresponding objects in the cluster category, so they cannot be seen in that setup.\n\n1.5. Outline. In Section 2, we discuss cyclic polytopes and provide a new combinatorial description of\ntheir triangulations in the even-dimensional case. In Section 3, we discuss the higher Auslander algebras of\nlinearly oriented An and their tilting modules. In Section 4, we compare the local moves for triangulations\n(bistellar flip) and tilting modules (tilting mutation), and show that they agree. In Section 5, a cluster\ncategory is constructed for any d-representation finite algebra. We apply the construction from Section 5\nto the higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented An in Section 6. In Section 7, we exhibit higherdimensional tropical exchange relations. In Section 8, we discuss certain classical (d = 1) phenomena\nwhich do not persist in higher dimensions.\nThe initial subsection of each section contains the statements of the main results of that section.\nReaders who are not interested in the details of the proofs in a particular section can safely skip all\nsubsequent subsections.\nAcknowledgements.

Cyclic polytopes\nThe moment curve is the curve defined by pt = (t, t2 , . . . , t\u03b4 ) \u2282 R\u03b4 , for t \u2208 R. Choose m distinct real\nvalues, t1 < t2 < * * * < tm . The convex hull of pt1 , . . . , ptm is a cyclic polytope. (We will take this as our\ndefinition of cyclic polytope, though sometimes a somewhat more general definition is used.)\nWe will be interested in triangulations of C(m, \u03b4). A triangulation of C(m, \u03b4) is a subdivision of\nC(m, \u03b4) into \u03b4-dimensional simplices whose vertices are vertices of C(m, \u03b4). We write S(m, \u03b4) for the set\nof all triangulations of C(m, \u03b4). A triangulation can be specified by giving the collection of (\u03b4 + 1)-subsets\nof {1, . . . , m} corresponding to the \u03b4-simplices of the triangulation. It turns out that whether or not a\ncollection of (\u03b4 + 1)-subsets of {1, . . . , m} forms a triangulation is independent of the values t1 < * * * < tm\nchosen, so, for convenience, we set ti = i. Combinatorial descriptions of the set of triangulations of\nC(m, \u03b4) appear in the literature [Ram, Tho], but for our purposes a new description is required.\nWe will mainly be interested in the case where \u03b4 = 2d is even. In R2d , we will refer to upper and lower\nwith respect to the 2d-th coordinate. The upper facets of C(m, 2d) are those which divide C(m, 2d) from\npoints above it, while the lower facets of C(m, 2d) are those which divide it from points below it. Each\nfacet of C(m, 2d) is either upper or lower.\nWe will be particularly interested in d-dimensional simplices whose vertices are vertices of C(m, 2d).\nWe refer to such d-dimensional simplices as d-dimensional simplices in C(m, 2d) (leaving unstated the\nassumption that their vertices are vertices of C(m, 2d)). By convention, we record such simplices as\nincreasing (d + 1)-tuples from [1, m] = {1, 2, . . . , m}.\nLemma 2.1. Let A = (a0 , . . . , ad ) be a d-simplex in C(m, 2d).\n(1) A lies within a lower boundary facet of C(m, 2d) iff A contains i and i + 1 for some i.\n(2) A lies within an upper boundary facet of C(m, 2d) and not within any lower boundary facet iff A\ndoes not contain i and i + 1 for any i, and contains both 1 and m.\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n5\n\n(3) Otherwise, the relative interior of A lies in the interior of C(m, 2d). We refer to such d-faces as\ninternal.\nWe define index sets as follows:\nDefinition 2.2.\nIdm = {(i0 , . . . , id ) \u2208 {1, . . . , m}d+1 | \u2200x \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , d \u2212 1} : ix + 2 \u2264 ix+1 }\nIdm = {(i0 , . . . , id ) \u2208 Idm | id + 2 \u2264 i0 + m}.\nNow Lemma 2.1 can be rephrased as saying that Idm indexes the internal d-simplices of C(m, 2d),\nwhile Idm indexes the d-simplices in C(m, 2d) which do not lie on a lower boundary facet.\nLet S be a triangulation of C(m, 2d). Denote by e(S) the set of d-simplices in C(m, 2d) which appear\nas a face of some simplex in S, and which do not lie on any lower boundary facet of C(m, 2d).\nLet X and Y be increasing (d + 1)-tuples of real numbers. We say that X = (x0 , . . . , xd ) intertwines\nY = (y0 , . . . , yd ) if x0 < y0 < x1 < y1 * * * < xd < yd . We write X \u2240 Y for this relation. A collection of\nincreasing (d + 1)-tuples is called non-intertwining if no pair of the elements intertwine (in either order).\n\u0001\nTheorem 2.3. For any S \u2208 S(m, 2d) the set e(S) consists of exactly m\u2212d\u22121\nelements of Idm , and is\nd\nnon-intertwining.\nWe also have a converse result:\nTheorem 2.4. Any non-intertwining collection of\nS(m, 2d).\n\n\u0001\n\nm\u2212d\u22121\nd\n\nelements of Idm is e(S) for a unique S \u2208\n\nExample 2.5. We consider the above theorems in the case d = 1. If S is a triangulation of C(m, 2),\nthen e(S) consists of the internal edges of the triangulation together with the edge 1m. The theorems\nare clear in this case.\n2.1. Proof of Theorem 2.3. We recall Radon's Theorem, which can be found, for example, as [Bar,\nTheorem I.4.1]:\nTheorem 2.6. Given e + 2 points in Re , they can be partitioned into two disjoint sets C and D such\nthat the convex hulls of C and D intersect.\nP\ne\nai vi = 0 where\nP An affine dependency among vectors {v1 , . . . , vr } in R is a relation of the form\nai = 0, but the coefficients are not all zero.\nWe can make Radon's Theorem more specific if we begin with 2d + 2 distinct points on the moment\ncurve in R2d . The result below is essential for us, so we provide a proof; a different proof can be found\nin [ER].\nLemma 2.7. Let a1 < * * * < a2d+2 . Among the points pa1 , . . . , pa2d+2 there is a unique affine dependency,\nwhich can be expressed in the form\nX\nX\nc i p ai =\nc i p ai\ni even\n\nwhere the ci are all positive and\n\nX\n\ni even\n\ni odd\n\nci = 1 =\n\nX\n\nci\n\ni odd\n\nProof. Because the moment curve is degree 2d, it can have at most 2d intersections with any (affine)\nhyperplane. Thus, the 2d + 2 points which we consider do not all lie on any hyperplane, so there must\nbe exactly one affine dependency among\nP them.\nP\nP\nP\nExpress the affine dependency as i\u2208I ci pai = i6\u2208I ci pai , with ci \u2265 0 and i\u2208I ci = i6\u2208I ci . Since\nno 2d + 1 points lie in a hyperplane, any proper subset of the {pai } is affinely independent, and thus we\nmust have all ci > 0. If the affine dependency is not of the form given in the statement of the lemma, we\nmust have that either I or I c = {1, . . . , 2d + 2} \\ I contains two consecutive integers, so without loss of\ngenerality suppose that {i, i + 1} \u2282 I.\nMore geometrically, the affine dependency implies that the convex hull of {pai }i\u2208I intersects the\nconvex hull of {pai }i\u2208I c . Deform this configuration by moving ai+1 towards ai . The point of intersection\nnecessarily moves continuously as ai+1 is deformed. As ai+1 moves, the point of intersection cannot hit\nthe boundary of the convex hull of {pai }i\u2208I c , because, if it did, that would amount to an affine dependency\nomitting some paj , which we have already said is impossible.\n\n\f6\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nThus, by continuity, we will still have an affine dependency when ai+1 reaches ai . But that is impossible,\nsince now we would have an affine dependency among 2d + 1 points not all on a hyperplane.\n\u0003\nThe previous lemma can also be expressed as saying that if X and Y are intertwining (d + 1)-tuples,\nthen the corresponding d-simplices intersect in a single interior point of both, while if X and Y are\ndistinct (d + 1)-tuples which do not intertwine, the relative interiors of their corresponding simplices are\ndisjoint.\nLemma 2.8. If S \u2208 S(m, 2d), then e(S) is non-intertwining.\nProof. The elements of e(S) are faces of simplices in the triangulation. Thus, they cannot intersect in a\nsingle point in both their interiors. It follows that e(S) is non-intertwining.\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 2.1. This follows immediately from the description of the upper and lower boundary\nfacets of C(m, 2d) given in [ER, Lemma 2.3]: the lower boundary facets of C(m, 2d) are precisely those\nsimplices whose vertices are 2d-subsets consisting of a union of d pairs of the form {i, i + 1}, while the\nupper boundary facets are precisely those simplices whose vertices are 2d-subsets consisting of a union\nof d \u2212 1 pairs of the form {i, i + 1} together with {1, m}.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nWe next show that if S \u2208 S(m, 2d), then |e(S)| = m\u2212d\u22121\n. We do this in two steps, first showing that\nd\n\u0001\nm\u2212d\u22121\nthe number of simplices in S is\n, and then showing that there is a way to assign each element of\nd\ne(S) to a simplex of S in a one-to-one way.\nDefinition 2.9. We say that (i0 , i1 , . . . , ik ) is separated if ix+1 \u2265 ix + 2 for all 0 \u2264 x \u2264 k \u2212 1.\nUsing this term, we can rephrase the definition of Idm as the set of separated (d + 1)-tuples from\n{1, 2, . . . , m}.\n\u0001\nLemma 2.10. For S \u2208 S(m, 2d), the triangulation S contains m\u2212d\u22121\nsimplices.\nd\n\nProof. Consider some separated d-tuple from [2, m \u2212 1], say A = (a1 , . . . , ad ). Collapse together the\nvertices of C(m, 2d) less than a1 , then those greater than a1 but less than a2 , etc. (That is to say, move\nthe given sets of vertices along the moment curve until they coincide.) A triangulation of C(m, 2d) will\nyield a triangulation of the smaller polytope resulting from this process: deform the triangulation along\nwith the polytope, and throw away any simplices which degenerate. In this case, the result is a cyclic\npolytope with 2d + 1 vertices. This polytope is itself a simplex, so it has only one triangulation. The\nunique simplex of this triangulation must have come from some simplex of C(m, 2d). Therefore, there\nmust be exactly one simplex of S of the form (b0 , a1 , b1 , . . . , bd\u22121 , ad , bd ) (for the specified values of ai\nand some bi , such that the (2d + 1)-tuple is increasing as listed). Clearly, any simplex of S satisfies\nthis property for exactly one choice of d-subset \u0001A, so there must be as many simplices in S as there are\nseparated d-tuples in [2, m \u2212 1], that is, m\u2212d\u22121\n.\n\u0003\nd\nFor A = (a0 , . . . , a2d ) an increasing (2d + 1)-tuple from [1, m], define the (d + 1)-tuple e(A) =\n(a0 , a2 , . . . a2d ) by taking the even-index terms from A. Similarly we set o(A) = (a1 , a3 , . . . , a2d\u22121 ).\nGiven a simplex C of dimension less than 2d, the points immediately below it are those points which\nare a small distance below some point in the relative interior of C.\nLemma 2.11. If A is a 2d-simplex of some triangulation in S(m, 2d), then A contains the points immediately below e(A).\n\nProof. Consider 2d + 2 points on the moment curve, with the first 2d + 1 corresponding to the vertices of\n\u221e. The vector pt approaches\nA, in order, and the last being pt , with t varying. Consider the effect as t\n\u221e) a point which\nvertical. Thus, the point in common between e(A) and ho(A), pt i approaches (as t\nlies in e(A) and which has a point in o(A) vertically below it. It follows that any point between these\ntwo will be in A.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.12. If A is a 2d-simplex of some triangulation in S(m, 2d), and E a d-face of A, with e(A) 6=\nE, then A does not contain the points immediately below E.\nProof. Let A = (a0 , . . . , a2d ), which we can think of as a realization of C(2d + 1, 2d). The lower facets\nof A are those obtained by deleting some a2j (again by [ER, Lemma 2.3]). Knowing that E 6= e(A), we\nknow that E lies inside at least one lower facet. Thus the points immediately below E lie outside A. \u0003\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n7\n\nProposition 2.13. For S \u2208 S(m, 2d),\ne(S) = {e(A) | A \u2208 S}\nProof. Clearly, if A is a simplex of S, then e(A) is a face of S, and it is also automatic that it is separated.\nIt follows that for A \u2208 S, we have that e(A) \u2208 e(S).\nLet E be a d-face of S which is separated. By Lemma 2.1, E does not lie in the union of the lower facets\nof C(m, 2d). This means that there are points immediately below E which lie inside C(m, 2d). These\n\u0003\npoints must lie in some simplex A of S. By Lemma 2.12 this can only happen if the face is e(A).\nLemma 2.14. For S \u2208 S(m, 2d) and A, B distinct simplices in S, e(A) 6= e(B).\nProof. If e(A) = e(B), the points immediately below e(A) = e(B) must lie in both A and B, so A = B.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.13 and Lemma 2.14 together imply that \u0001the number of elements of e(S) equals the\n. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.3.\nnumber of simplices of S, which, by Lemma 2.10, is m\u2212d\u22121\nd\n2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.4.\n\nLemma 2.15. For S \u2208 S(m, 2d), the faces of S of dimension at least d consist of exactly those simplices\nwhose d-faces are either not separated or are contained in e(S).\nProof. Dey [Dey] shows that, for any triangulation T of a point configuration in R\u03b4 , it is possible to\nreconstruct T on the basis of knowing only its \u230a \u03b42 \u230b-faces. We follow Dey's approach, but specialize to our\nsetting, where it is possible to give a somewhat simpler description of the reconstructed triangulation.\nLet S \u2208 S(m, 2d), and let A be a k-dimensional simplex of S with k \u2265 d. Clearly, the d-dimensional\nfaces of A are also d-simplices of S. The d-simplices of S correspond to the (d + 1)-tuples in e(S) and\nthose increasing (d + 1)-tuples from [1, m] which are not separated, so one direction of the lemma is\nshown.\nFor the other direction, suppose that we have a k-simplex A in C(m, 2d), which does not belong to S.\nThe relative interior of A must intersect the relative interior of some j-simplex B of S with j \u2265 k. Dey\n[Dey, Lemma 3.1] points out that in R2d , if a k-simplex A and a j-simplex B intersect in their relative\ninteriors, with k + j \u2265 2d, then there must be a k \u2032 -face A\u2032 of A and a j \u2032 -face B \u2032 of B which intersect in\ntheir relative interiors, with k \u2032 + j \u2032 \u2264 2d. That is to say, among the at most 2d + 2 vertices of A\u2032 and\nB \u2032 , there must be an affine dependency. By Lemma 2.7, the form of this affine dependency implies that\nA\u2032 \u2240 B \u2032 or the reverse. In particular A\u2032 and B \u2032 must both be d-faces. B \u2032 belongs to S since B does. A\u2032\nand B \u2032 intersect in their relative interiors, so A\u2032 cannot be a face of S. We have shown that there is a\nd-face of A which is not a d-face of S, as desired.\n\u0003\nWe now define two operations on triangulations, following [RaS, Section 3].\nDefinition 2.16. Let S \u2208 S(m, 2d).\n(1) We define S/1 to be the triangulation of C([2, m], 2d) which is obtained from S by moving the\nvertices 1 and 2 together and throwing away the simplices that degenerate.\n(2) We define S \\ 1 to be the triangulation of C([2, m], 2d \u2212 1) obtained by taking only the simplices\nof S that contain 1, and then removing 1 from them. This clearly defines a triangulation of the\nvertex figure of C(m, 2d) at 1, that is to say, of the (2d \u2212 1)-dimensional polytope obtained by\nintersecting C(m, 2d) with a hyperplane which cuts off the vertex 1. This vertex figure is not a\ncyclic polytope according to our definition, but its vertices determine the same oriented matroid\nas the vertices of a cyclic polytope, which is sufficient to imply that a triangulation of the vertex\nfigure also determines a triangulation of C([2, m], 2d \u2212 1), and conversely (see [RaS, Lemma 3.1]\nfor details). We write S \\ {1, 2} for (S \\ 1) \\ 2.\nWe next define two operations on subsets of Idm . We will eventually relate these to the operations we\nhave already defined on S(m, 2d), but for now, they are separate.\nFor an e-tuple A = (a1 , . . . , ae ) with a1 > 1 we denote by 1 \u22c6 A the (e + 1)-tuple (1, a1 , . . . , ae ). For\na set X of e-tuples with this property we denote by 1 \u22c6 X the set {1 \u22c6 A | A \u2208 X}. Similarly we define\n2 \u22c6 A and 2 \u22c6 X.\nDefinition 2.17. Let X \u2282 Idm .\n(1) X/1 is obtained from X by replacing all 1's by 2's, and removing any resulting tuples which are\nnot separated.\n\n\f8\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\n(2) X \\ {1, 2} consists of all d-tuples A from [3, m] such that 1 \u22c6 A is in X and either 2 \u22c6 A is in X or\n3 \u2208 A. (These two possibilities are mutually exclusive, since if 3 \u2208 A, then 2 \u22c6 A is not separated,\nand so it cannot be in X.)\nNote that for X \u2282 Idm , we do not define X \\ 1; instead, we define X \\ {1, 2} in one step.\nLemma 2.18. If X is a non-intertwining subset of Idm , so are X/1 and X \\ {1, 2}.\nb B\nb for elements of X which\nProof. X/1 is separated by definition. Suppose that A \u2240 B in X/1. Write A,\nb = B, and thus A\nb \u2240 B,\nb a\nwitness the presence of A, B in X/1. The minimal entry of B is at least 3, so B\ncontradiction.\nIt is immediate that X \\ {1, 2} is separated. Suppose that A \u2240 B in X \\ {1, 2}. Then 1 \u22c6 A \u2208 X. Since\nA \u2240 B, the minimal element of B is at least 4, so 2 \u22c6 B \u2208 X. But (1 \u22c6 A) \u2240 (2 \u22c6 B), a contradiction.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.19. |X/1| + |X \\ {1, 2}| = |X|.\nProof. The difference |X| \u2212 |X/1| is accounted for by elements 1 \u22c6 A in X such that either 2 \u22c6 A is in X\nor 3 \u2208 A. These exactly correspond to the elements of X \\ {1, 2}.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nm\u2212d\u22121\nd\nLemma 2.20. The maximal size of a non-intertwining subset of Im is\n. Also, if X is a set of\nd\n\u0001\n\u0001\nm\u2212d\u22122\nm\u2212d\u22122\nthat size, |X/1| =\n, and |X \\ {1, 2}| = d\u22121 .\nd\n\u0001\nProof. We know that there do exist non-intertwining subsets of Idm of cardinality m\u2212d\u22121\n, because, by\nd\nTheorem 2.3, e(S) is of this form for any S \u2208 C(m, 2d).\nThe proof that this is the maximum possible size is by induction on m and d. Let X be such a set.\nX/1 is a\u0001 set of non-intertwining separated (d+ 1)-tuples in [2, m], and thus by induction its size is at most\nm\u2212d\u22122\n. X \\ {1, 2} is a collection of non-intertwining separated d-tuples in [3, m]; its size is therefore at\nd\n\u0001\nm\u2212d\u22122\nmost d\u22121 . Thus\n|X| = |X/1| + |X \\ {1, 2}|\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nm\u2212d\u22122\nm\u2212d\u22122\nm\u2212d\u22121\n\u2264\n+\n=\n.\nd\nd\u22121\nd\n\nAlso, if X achieves equality, the corresponding equalities for X/1 and X \\ {1, 2} must also hold, which\nestablishes the second point.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nm\u2212d\u22121\nLemma 2.21. If X and Y are non-intertwining subsets of Idm of cardinality\nsuch that X/1 = Y /1\nd\nand X \\ {1, 2} = Y \\ {1, 2}, then X = Y .\nProof. The tuples of X and Y in which neither 1 nor 2 appears must be the same, using only the fact\nthat X/1 = Y /1.\nWe next consider the elements of X and Y which contain 1. Let A be the lexicographically final\nelement of X, containing 1, which is not contained in Y . Let A\u2032 be obtained from A by replacing 1 by 2.\nIf A\u2032 \u2208 X, then A \\ 1 \u2208 X \\ {1, 2}, which then implies that A \u2208 Y . So A\u2032 6\u2208 X.\nAlso, if 3 \u2208 A, then A \\ 1 \u2208 X \\ {1, 2}, which we already saw is false. So 3 6\u2208 A.\nSince A/1 \u2208 X/1 = Y /1, there must be some element of Y which implies that A/1 \u2208 Y /1. Since we\nknow A 6\u2208 Y , it must be that A\u2032 \u2208 Y .\nSo X contains A and not A\u2032 , while Y contains A\u2032 and not A. Since A 6\u2208 Y , there must be some element\n\u2032\nB of Y satisfying A \u2240 B \u2032 . Since we do not have A\u2032 \u2240 B \u2032 , the minimum element of B \u2032 must be 2. Since\nA \u2208 X, we know that B \u2032 is not in X. Since B \u2032 /1 \u2208 Y /1 = X/1, we must have that B \u2208 X, where B is\nobtained from B \u2032 by replacing 2 by 1. Since B \u2032 6\u2208 X, we have B \\ 1 = B \u2032 \\ 2 6\u2208 X \\ {1, 2} = Y \\ {1, 2},\nwhich implies that B 6\u2208 Y . Thus B is in X but not Y .\nSince A \u2240 B \u2032 , we have that B lexicographically follows A, contradicting our choice of A. Thus X and\nY have the same elements which contain 1.\nNow consider the elements of X and Y which contain 2. Let A\u2032 be an element of X containing 2, and\nlet A be the same element with 2 replaced by 1. If A \u2208 X as well, then A \\ 1 \u2208 X \\ {1, 2} = Y \\ {1, 2},\nand thus A\u2032 \u2208 Y . If A 6\u2208 X, then A 6\u2208 Y (since A contains 1, it falls in the case already considered), but\nA\u2032 \u2208 X/1 = Y /1, which forces A\u2032 \u2208 Y .\n\u0003\nFor a triangulation Q of C(p, \u03b4) and a triangulation P of C(p, \u03b4 \u2212 1), we write that P \u227a Q if each\nsimplex of P is a facet of at least one simplex of Q. In this case, the simplices of Q are divided into two\nclasses, those above P and those below P .\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n9\n\nWe have the following proposition, which we cite in a convenient form, restricted to the case which is\nof interest to us. (As it appears in [RaS], it treats subdivisions of cyclic polytopes which are more general\nthan triangulations.)\nProposition 2.22 ([RaS, Lemma 4.7(1)]). Let T be a triangulation of C([2, m], 2d), and let W be a\ntriangulation of C([3, m], 2d \u2212 2). Then there exists a triangulation S of C(m, 2d) with S/1 = T and\nS \\ {1, 2} = W iff W \u227a T \\ 2.\nIn this case, the triangulation S is unique, and can be described as follows. Let T \u25e6 denote those\nsimplices of T which do not contain 2.

Let S \u2208 S(m, 2d). Then e(S/1) = e(S)/1.\nProof. If E \u2208 e(S/1), then it is e(C) for some simplex C in S/1, and that simplex comes from some\nb in S.

The\nb\nimage C of C in S/1 is a face of S/1 (which is 2d- or (2d \u2212 1)-dimensional). Now E is a face of C, and\nhence of S/1.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.24. Let S \u2208 S(m, 2d). Then e(S \\ {1, 2}) = e(S) \\ {1, 2}.\nProof. Let E \u2208 e(S \\ {1, 2}). So S contains a simplex 1 \u22c6 2 \u22c6 A with e(A) = E. Now 1 \u22c6 E is a face of\nS, so 1 \u22c6 E \u2208 e(S). We also have that 2 \u22c6 E is a face of S, so either 2 \u22c6 E \u2208 e(S), or 2 \u22c6 E lies on a\nlower boundary facet. In the former case, we have that E \u2208 e(S) \\ {1, 2}, and we are done. In the latter\ncase, by Lemma 2.1, 2 \u22c6 E is not separated, which must be because 3 \u2208 E, so, again, we conclude that\nE \u2208 e(S) \\ {1, 2}, as desired.\nOn the other hand, let E \u2208 e(S) \\ {1, 2}. Let T = S/1, W = S \\ {1, 2}, and apply Proposition 2.22.\nb for some simplex C\nb of S. If C\nb is an element of 1 \u22c6 2 \u22c6 W , then\nWe know that 1 \u22c6 E \u2208 e(S).

But\nSince the points immediately below 1 \u22c6 E lie in C,\nb for D\nb a simplex of S and it cannot be\nthis means that 2 \u22c6 E is not a face of S, so it cannot be e(D)\nnon-separated, by Lemma 2.1.

It follows by induction that X/1 and\nd\nd\u22121\nX \\ {1, 2} define unique triangulations, of C([2, m], 2d) and C([3, m], 2d \u2212 2), respectively, which we can\ndenote T and W .\nLemma 2.25. W \u227a T \\ 2.\nProof. Let A be a (2d \u2212 2)-simplex of W . We wish to show that A is a face of T \\ 2, or in other words,\nthat 2 \u22c6 A is a face of T . By Lemma 2.15, it suffices to show that any d-face of 2 \u22c6 W is a face of T .\nSuch faces are of two kinds: first, faces of the form 2 \u22c6 E, with E a (d \u2212 1)-face of W , and, second,\nd-faces of W .\nIf E \u2208 e(W ), then by definition E \u2208 X \\ {1, 2}, so 1 \u22c6 E is in X, and 2 \u22c6 E is either on the boundary\nof C([2, m], d) or it is in X/1; either way, we are done.\nIf E lies on a lower boundary facet of W , then it is not separated, so neither is 2 \u22c6 E, which therefore\nlies on a lower boundary facet of T .\nNow consider F = (a0 , . . . , ad ) a d-face of W . We know that the other d-faces of 2 \u22c6 F are in T . If F\nis not, then, since e(T ) is maximal, there is some B = (b0 , . . . , bd ) in e(T ) such that B \u2240 F or F \u2240 B.\nSuppose F \u2240 B. Then B also intertwines (2, a1 , . . . , ad ), but that contradicts the assertion that\n(2, a1 , . . . , ad ) is in e(T ).\nSo suppose B \u2240 F . If b0 > 2, then (2, a0 , . . . , ad\u22121 ) \u2240 B, which is again a contradiction. So b0 = 2.\ne = (eb0 , b1 , . . . , bd ). Suppose first\nSince B is in X/1 = e(T ), it lifts to (at least) one element of X, say B\ne = (1, a0 , . . . , ad\u22121 ) in X. But A\ne \u2240 B,\ne\nthat eb0 = 2. Since (a0 , . . . , ad\u22121 ) is a (d \u2212 1)-face of W , it lifts to A\na contradiction.\n\n\f10\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\ne\u2032 = (2, a1 , . . . , ad ).

By Lemma 2.21, X = e(S). By Lemma 2.15,\nS is the only triangulation with e(S) = X.\n\u0003\n3. Higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented An and their cluster tilting\nmodules\nWe begin this section by recalling some background on higher Auslander algebras (see [Iya]). We\nalways assume \u039b to be a finite dimensional algebra over some field k.\nDefinition 3.1.\n\n(1) A d-cluster tilting module ([Iya]) is a module M \u2208 mod \u039b, such that\nadd M = {X \u2208 mod M | Exti\u039b (X, M ) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , d \u2212 1}}\n= {X \u2208 mod M | Exti\u039b (M, X) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , d \u2212 1}}.\n\n(2) If \u039b has a d-cluster tilting module, and moreover gl.dim \u039b \u2264 d, then \u039b is called d-representation\nfinite ([IO1]).\nIyama [Iya] has shown that for a d-representation finite algebra \u039b, the d-cluster tilting module M as\nin the definition above is unique up to multiplicity (see Theorem 3.10 below).\nDefinition 3.2. Let \u039b be d-representation finite, and M be the basic d-cluster tilting module. Then the\nd-Auslander algebra of \u039b is End\u039b (M ).\nWe now focus on the case of higher Auslander algebras of linear oriented An . We denote by A1n =\n2\n***\nn] the quiver algebra of a linearly oriented An quiver. We denote by A1n Si the simple\nk[1\nmodule concentrated in vertex i, by A1n Pi its projective cover, and by A1n Ii its injective envelope. Then\nthe numbering of the vertices is chosen in such a way that\nHomA1n (A1n Pi , A1n Pj ) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 i \u2264 j.\n\u2022 A1n is 1-representation finite. We denote its basic 1Theorem / Construction 3.3 ([Iya]).\ncluster tilting module by A1n M , and the 1-Auslander algebra of A1n by A2n = EndA1n (A1n M ).\n\u2022 A2n is 2-representation finite. We denote its basic 2-cluster tilting module by A2n M , and the 2Auslander algebra of A2n by A3n = EndA2n (A2n M ).\n.\nspace ..\n\u2022 This iterates. That is, Adn is d-representation finite. We denote its basic d-cluster tilting module\nby Adn M , and the d-Auslander algebra of Adn by Ad+1\n= EndAdn (Adn M ).\nn\nWe remark that the case d = 1 of the above theorem is classical. An algebra is 1-representation finite\nif and only if it is representation finite and hereditary. A 1-cluster tilting module is by definition an\nadditive generator of the module category. The 1-Auslander algebra of A1n is then the classical Auslander\nalgebra of A1n .\nIyama [Iya] gives descriptions of these algebras Adn by giving quivers and relations (see also Table 1\nfor an idea of how these quivers look). Here we follow a slightly different approach in indexing the\nindecomposable summands of Adn M , which will allow us to immediately read off when there are non-zero\nhomomorphisms or non-zero extensions between two such summands (see Theorem 3.6(5 and 6)). Since\nour aim here is to study tilting modules (in Theorem 3.8 and in Section 4), it is particularly important\nto us to be able to decide whether extension groups vanish.\nIn the theorem below, we use the indexing set Idn+2d , as in Definition 2.2. It consists of the separated\n(d + 1)-tuples from {1, . . . , n + 2d}.\nAssigning labels to summands of Adn M we follow an inductive construction.

Thinking of quivers (see Table 1) the statement on the composition factors of the Mi0 ,...id\njust means that Mi0 ,...,id has a \"box-shaped\" support, which lies properly between the vertices (i0 \u2212\n1, . . . , id\u22121 \u2212 1) and (i1 \u2212 1, . . . , id \u2212 1). (Here the \"\u22121\"s are just a result of normalizing the indexing\nsets, so that they start at 1 for all d.)\nWith the indexing of Theorem 3.4, we have the following result:\nTheorem 3.6. For given n and d we have\n(1) Adn Pi0 ,...,id\u22121 = Adn M1,i0 +2,...,id\u22121 +2 .\n(2) Adn Ii0 ,...,id\u22121 = Adn Mi0 ,...,id\u22121 ,n+2d .\n(3) HomAdn (Adn Mi0 ,...,id , Adn Mj0 ,...,jd ) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 i0 \u2212 1 < j0 < i1 \u2212 1 < j1 < * * * < id \u2212 1 < jd , and in\nthis case the Hom-space is one-dimensional.\n(4) ExtdAdn (Adn Mi0 ,...,id , Adn Mj0 ,...,jd ) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 (j0 , . . . , jd ) \u2240 (i0 , . . . , id ) (see Section 2), and in this case\nthe Ext-space is one-dimensional.\nWe note that, by the previous theorem, the projective-injective indecomposables of Adn are indexed\nby the elements of Idn+2d \\ Idn+2d . By Lemma 2.1, these correspond to the d-simplices of C(n + 2d, 2d)\nwhich lie in an upper boundary facet and in no lower boundary facet.

We have seen in Lemma 3.15 that our modules Adn Mi0 ,...,id have the desired composition factors. It remains to show that they are precisely the direct summands of Adn M .\nBy construction the modules Adn M1,i1 ,...,id are precisely the projective Adn -modules. Hence, by Theorem 3.10, we only have to see that the modules of the form Adn Mi0 ,...,id are precisely the modules\nobtained by applying \u03c4d\u2212 -powers to modules of the form Adn M1,i1 ,...,id . This follows immediately from\nProposition 3.13.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.6. (1) holds by construction, and we have proven (2) above. (3) is a consequence of\nProposition 3.12. It remains to deduce (4). This follows immediately from (3), Observation 3.11, and\nProposition 3.13.\n\u0003\nFinally we show that this also completes the proof of Corollary 3.7.\nProof of Corollary 3.7. The correspondence between (1) and (2) is given by Theorems 2.3 and 2.4. The\ncorrespondence between (1) and (3) is immediate from Theorem 3.6.\n\u0003\n3.3. Exchanging tilting modules \u2013 proof of Theorem 3.8. Throughout this subsection we work\nonly over the algebra Adn . Hence we can omit the left indices Adn without risking confusion. We start by\nproving the second part of Theorem 3.8.\nProof of Theorem 3.8(2). We have to exclude the cases that either ExtdAdn (Mi0 ,...,id , Mj0 ,...,jd ) and ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Mi0 ,...,id )\nare both zero, or both non-zero.\nIt follows from Theorem 3.6(4) that they cannot both be non-zero. Hence assume they are both zero.\nThen T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd has no self-extensions. This contradicts the fact that T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id is a\ntilting module with Mj0 ,...,jd 6\u2208 add(T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id ).\n\u0003\nSince the two possibilities of Theorem 3.8(2) are dual, we may assume we are in the first mentioned\nsituation, that is we have ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Mi0 ,...,id ) 6= 0.\nWe now point out that Theorem 3.8(4) implies Theorem 3.8(1 and 3):\nProof of Theorem 3.8(1), assuming Theorem 3.8(4). By Theorem 3.8(4b) the monomorphism Mi0 ,...,id\nEd\nis a left T -approximation. We denote its cokernel by C. By [RiS], T \u2295 C is a tilting Adn -module. We again\nhave a monomorphic left T -approximation C\nEd\u22121 . Iterating this argument we see that T \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd\nis a tilting Adn -module.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.8(3), assuming Theorem 3.8(4). This follows immediately from the fact that the left\nset in (3) is, by Theorem 3.8(4a), contained in\nadd(Mi0 ,...,id \u2295 Ed \u2295 * * * \u2295 E1 \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd ) \u2286 add(T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd ),\nwhere the above inclusion follows from 3.8(4b).\n\n\u0003\n\nThus it only remains to prove Theorem 3.8(4). We start by constructing an exact sequence with the\ndesired terms.\nProposition 3.19. Let (i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd ) \u2208 Idn+2d with (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240 (j0 , . . . , jd ). Then there is an\nexact sequence\nEd\n***\nE1\nE0\nE : Ed+1\n|{z}\n| {z }\n=Mj0 ,...,jd\n\n=Mi0 ,...,id\n\nwith\n\nEr =\n\nM\n\nM mX .\n\nX\u2286{0,...,d}\n|X|=r\n\nHere mX is short for mX ((i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd )). We set MmX = 0 whenever mX 6\u2208 Idn+2d .\nProof. We describe the exact sequence\nE : Ed+1\n\nEd\n\nby specifying that the component maps are\n\u001a\nY\n(\u22121)|{x\u2208X|x<y}|hm\nmX\nM mX\nM mY :\n0\n\n***\n\nE1\n\nE0\n\nif mX , mY \u2208 Idn+2d and X = Y \u222a {y} for some y 6\u2208 Y\notherwise.\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n19\n\nTo check that the sequence E with the maps as defined above is exact it suffices to check that for\nevery indecomposable projective Adn -module Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 the sequence HomAdn (Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 , E) is exact. If\nHomAdn (Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 , MmX ) = 0 for all X \u2286 {0, . . . , d} this is clearly true. Otherwise, writing mX =\n(m0 , . . . , md ), Theorem 3.6(3) implies that, if mX \u2208 Idn+2d , we have\nHomAdn (Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 , MmX ) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 m0 < l0 + 1 < m1 < l1 + 1 < * * * < ld\u22121 + 1 < md .\n\n(3)\n\nSince, in addition, neither side of (3) holds if mX is not separated, (3) holds for all X. Thus, if we split\nthe set {0, . . . , d} into the three parts\nX0 = {x | lx\u22121 + 1 < ix < lx + 1 and not(lx\u22121 + 1 < jx < lx + 1)},\nX1 = {x | lx\u22121 + 1 < ix < lx + 1 and lx\u22121 + 1 < jx < lx + 1}, and\nX2 = {x | not(lx\u22121 + 1 < ix < lx + 1) and lx\u22121 + 1 < jx < lx + 1},\n(where in all cases we assume the conditions l\u22121 + 1 < ? and ? < ld + 1 to always be true), we have that\n\u001a\nk if X0 \u2286 X \u2286 X0 \u222a X1\n(4)\nHomAdn (Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 , MmX ) =\n0 otherwise.\nWe now claim that X1 6= \u2205. Assume conversely that X1 = \u2205, and hence X0 \u222a X2 = {0, . . . , d}. The\nassumption (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240 (j0 , . . . , jd ) implies i0 < j0 and id < jd . These inequalities imply 0 6\u2208 X2 and\nd 6\u2208 X0 , respectively. Hence 0 \u2208 X0 and d \u2208 X2 . Therefore there is x with x \u2208 X0 and x + 1 \u2208 X2 .\nSince ix < jx it follows that jx 6< lx + 1, and since ix+1 < jx+1 it follows that lx + 1 6< ix+1 . Hence\nix+1 \u2264 lx +1 \u2264 jx , contradicting the fact that (i0 , . . . , id )\u2240(j0 , . . . , jd ). This proves the claim that X1 6= \u2205.\nNow it follows from (4) and the signs in the definition of the component maps that HomAdn (Pl0 ,...,ld\u22121 , E)\nis the Koszul complex [k\nk]\u2297|X1 | , shifted to the appropriate position. In particular it is exact.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.20. Let (i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd ) \u2208 Idn+2d with (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240 (j0 , . . . , jd ). Then the exact sequence E of Proposition 3.19 represents a non-zero element (and thus a k-basis) of ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Mi0 ,...,id ).\nProof. By Proposition 3.17 we know that the projective resolution of Mj0 ,...,jd is as given in the upper\nrow of the following diagram.\nM1,j0 +1,...,jd\u22121 +1\nfd+1\nEd+1\n\nM1,j0 +1,...,jd\u22122 +1,jd\n\nM1,j1 ,...,jd\n\n***\n\nMj0 ,...,jd\n\nf1\n\nfd\n***\n\nEd\n\nE1\n\nE0\n\nUsing Proposition 3.12 it is easy to verify that we may choose the maps fr on components by\nM1,j0 +1,...,jr\u22122 +1,jr ,...,jd\nM mX :\n\u001a\ni0 ,...,ir\u22121 ,jr ,...,jd\n\u00b1h1,j0 +1,...,jr\u22122 +1,jr ,...jd if X = {0, . . . , r \u2212 1}\n0\notherwise.\n1,j +1,...,j\n\n+1,jd\n\nSince fd+1 does not factor through h1,j00 +1,...,jd\u22122\nd\u22121 +1\n\nit follows that the extension E is non-split.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe rest of this section leads to a proof of Theorem 3.8(4). Therefore we assume that we are in the\nsetup of Theorem 3.8, that is, we are given T , Mi0 ,...,id and Mj0 ,...,jd such that T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id is a tilting\nAdn -module and T \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd is a different rigid Adn -module, and they both lie in add M . Moreover we\nassume that we are in the first case of Theorem 3.8(2), that is we assume ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Mi0 ,...,id ) 6= 0.\nBy Theorem 3.6(4) that means (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240 (j0 , . . . , jd ), and hence by Propositions 3.19 and 3.20 we have\na non-spilt d-extension E with middle terms as claimed in Theorem 3.8(4a).\nSince Tb := T \u2295 Mi0 ,...,id is a tilting Adn -module, and ExtiAdn (Tb, Mj0 ,...,jd ) = 0 \u2200i \u2265 0 there is an exact\nminimal Tb-resolution of Mj0 ,...,j :\nd\n\nb : Tbd+1\nT\n\nb\u223c\nOur aim now is to show that T\n= E.\n\nTbd\n\n***\n\nTb1\n\nMj0 ,...,jd\n\n\f20\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nb we obtain an exact sequence\nObservation 3.21.

Since,\nb no non-radical maps in HomAd (Tbd+1 , Tbd+1 ) factor through Tbd , such maps are\nby the minimality of T\nn\nmapped to non-zero extensions in ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Tbd+1 ). It follows that Tbd+1 = Mi0 ,...,id , since this is\nthe only summand of Tb which admits non-zero extensions with Mj0 ,...,j .\nd\n\nLemma 3.22. Let\n\n\u22a5= add{Ml0 ,...,ld | ExtdAdn (Mi0 ,...,id \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd , Ml0 ,...,ld ) = 0\nand ExtdAdn (Ml0 ,...,ld , Mi0 ,...,id \u2295 Mj0 ,...,jd ) = 0}.\nMj0 ,...,jd is a minimal right \u22a5-approximation of Mj0 ,...,jd , and Mi0 ,...,id\nThen E1\nleft \u22a5-approximation of Mi0 ,...,id .\n\nEd is a minimal\n\nProof. We only prove the first claim; the proof of the second is similar. By Theorem 3.6(3) there are\nMj0 ,...,jd if lx \u2264 jx \u2200x. By our general assumption ExtdAdn (Mj0 ,...,jd , Mi0 ,...,id ) 6= 0,\nonly maps Ml0 ,...,ld\nso we have (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240 (j0 , . . . , jd ), that is\ni0 < j0 < i1 < j1 < * * * < id < jd .\nSince we want to approximate by those Ml0 ,...,ld that satisfy ExtdAdn (Ml0 ,...,ld , Mi0 ,...,id ) = 0, that is\n(i0 , . . . , id )6 \u2240 (l0 , . . . , ld ), at least one of the above inequalities fails after replacing each jx with the corresponding lx . That is, \u2203x : ix 6< lx . In other words lx \u2264 ix . Hence we obtain the approximation by\nsumming up all possibilities of replacing one index jx by the corresponding ix .\n\u0003\nb\u223c\nProposition 3.23. With the above notation we have T\n= E.\n\nProof. We consider the following diagram.\nb\nT:\nE:\n\nTbd+1\n\nfd+1\n\nEd+1\n\nTbd\n\n***\n\nEd\n\n***\n\nfd\n\nTb2\n\nf2\n\nE2\n\nTb1\n\nMj0 ,...,jd\n\nE1\n\nE0\n\nf1\n\nHere the map f1 making the square to its right commutative exists by Lemma 3.22, since Tb1 \u2208\u22a5. Then\nthe dashed maps can be constructed inductively from right to left since all the objects are in add M\n(as in Observation 3.21 we see that HomAdn (Tbi+1 , Ei+1 )\nHomAdn (Tbi+1 , Ei )\nHomAdn (Tbi+1 , Ei\u22121 ) is\n\u223c\nb\nexact). Since E is non-split and Td+1 = Ed+1 = Mi0 ,...,id we know that fd+1 is an isomorphism. Since,\nby Lemma 3.22 the map Ed+1\nEd is a left \u22a5-approximation, and Tbd \u2208 add T \u2286\u22a5 it follows that fd\nb\nis an isomorphism. The rest of T as well as E are minimal M -coresolutions of the cokernels of their\nleft-most maps, respectively. Thus one can see iterately from left to right that all the vertical maps are\nisomorphisms.\n\u0003\nThis also completes the proof of Theorem 3.8(4). Part (5) of Theorem 3.8 is dual to part (4). Hence\nwe have also completed the proof of Theorem 3.8.\n4. Local moves\nThere is an operation on triangulations called a bistellar flip. Given e + 2 points in Re , no e + 1 lying\nin any hyperplane, there are two triangulations of their convex hull. A bistellar flip of a triangulation\nT is given by specifying some e + 2 vertices of the triangulation, no e + 1 lying in any hyperplane, such\nthat T restricts to a triangulation of the convex hull X of those e + 2 vertices. That bistellar flip of T\nis then obtained by replacing the part of T inside X by the other triangulation using those vertices. (It\nis possible to weaken the assumption that no e + 1 of the vertices involved in the bistellar flip lie on a\nhyperplane, but we shall not need to make use of that here.)\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n21\n\nTheorem 4.1. For S, T \u2208 S(m, 2d), we have that S and T are related by a bistellar flip iff e(S) and\ne(T ) have all but one (d+1)-tuple in common.\nExample 4.2. When d = 1 and the vertices are in convex position, a bistellar flip amounts to replacing\none diagonal of a quadrilateral with the other diagonal. The vertices of C(m, 2) are always in convex\nposition, so bistellar flips always amount to replacing one diagonal of a quadrilateral by the other one;\nclearly, if S and T are related in this way, then e(S) and e(T ) differ by one element, namely, the diagonal\nbeing flipped.\nWe recall the following result of Rambau:\nTheorem 4.3 ([Ram]). Any triangulation of a cyclic polytope can be transformed into any other one by\na sequence of bistellar flips.\nFrom this, we deduce the following central result of our paper:\nTheorem 4.4. Triangulations of C(n + 2d, 2d) correspond bijectively to basic tilting modules for Adn\ncontained in Adn M ; two triangulations are related by a bistellar flip iff the corresponding tilting objects\nare related by a single mutation.\nIf A \u2208 Idm and R is a non-intertwining subset of Idm not containing A, we say that A is a complement\nfor R if \u0001R \u222a {A} corresponds to a triangulation (that is to say, it is non-intertwining and has cardinality\nm\u2212d\u22121\n).\nd\nIf A and B are distinct complements to some R, they are called exchangeable.\nProposition 4.5. A and B are exchangeable iff they intertwine (in some order).\nd\nProposition 4.6. Let A and B be exchangeable. A and B are\n\u0001 complements to R \u2282 Im iff R is a\nm\u2212d\u22121\nd\nnon-intertwining subset of Im \\ {A, B} with cardinality\n\u2212 1, which contains every separated\nd\n(d + 1)-tuple from A \u222a B other than A and B.\n\nRemark 4.7. Suppose A and B are distinct complements to R \u2282 Idn+2d . By Theorems 3.8 and 4.4,\nthe indecomposable Adn -modules MA and MB are related by an exact sequence. All the indecomposable\nsummands of the terms of this exact sequence correspond to certain (d + 1)-tuples which are contained\nin R. This implies a weaker version of one direction of the previous proposition.\nExample 4.8. In the d = 1 case, it is clear that A and B are exchangeable iff they cross in their interiors\n(as line segments) iff they intertwine in some order (as increasing ordered pairs from {1, . . . , m}). In this\ncase, the triangulations in which A can be exchanged for B are exactly those containing A and the four\nedges of the quadrilateral defined by the vertices of A and B.\n4.1. Proofs for Section 4.\nProof of Proposition 4.5. Suppose that A and B are exchangeable; in other words, there is some R \u2282 Idm ,\nsuch that A and B are complements to R.\nSince {A} \u222a {B} \u222a R is too big to be a non-intertwining set of d-faces, but {A} \u222a R and {B} \u222a R are\nboth non-intertwining, it must be that A and B intertwine in some order. This proves the first direction.\nConversely, suppose that A and B intertwine. We must show that there is some R \u2282 Idm such that\nR \u222a {A} and R \u222a {B} correspond to triangulations.\nThe convex hull of A \u222a B is a cyclic polytope with 2d + 2 vertices. By Lemma 2.1, it has exactly two\ninternal d-simplices, A and B. A triangulation of C(2d + 2, 2d) must use exactly one of these internal\nd-simplices. The two triangulations of C(2d + 2, 2d) are related by a bistellar flip. Therefore, it suffices\nto show that there is a triangulation S of C(m, 2d) which restricts to a triangulation of the convex hull\nof A \u222a B.\nGiven a set of points X in Re , one way to construct a triangulation of their convex hull Q is to define\nb\na height function f : X \u2192 R, and then to consider the points in Re+1 of the form x\u0302 = (x, f (x)). Let Q\nb and project them onto Q. This defines\nbe the convex hull of the points x\u0302. Take the lower facets of Q\na subdivision of Q. If f is chosen generically, this subdivision will be a triangulation. Triangulations\narising in this way are called regular.\nDefine a height function for the m vertices of C(m, 2d), such that the vertices from A \u222a B are much\nlower than the other vertices. The above construction will result in a triangulation which restricts to a\ntriangulation of the convex hull of A \u222a B.\n\u0003\n\n\f22\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nWe recall an important property of cyclic polytopes:\nTheorem 4.9 ([Bar, Proposition VI.4.2]). In C(m, \u03b4), any set of \u230a \u03b42 \u230b or fewer vertices form the vertices\nof a boundary face.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. If triangulations S and T of C(m, 2d) are related by a bistellar flip, then they\ncoincide except inside the convex hull of some 2d + 2 vertices. We may think of this convex hull as a\ncopy of C(2d + 2, 2d). This cyclic polytope has exactly two internal d-simplices. S uses one and T uses\nthe other. The first direction of the theorem follows.\nFor the other direction, suppose that we have triangulations S and T with e(S) = R \u222a {A} and\ne(T ) = R \u222a {B}. Let A = (a0 , . . . , ad ), B = (b0 , . . . , bd ).\nLet Q be the region in C(m, 2d) formed by the union of the 2d-simplices of S containing A. This is\nalso the union of the 2d-simplices of T containing B, since the remaining 2d-simplices of S and T coincide\nby Lemma 2.15.\nLet Ai = (a0 , . . . , b\nai , . . . , ad ), that is to say, A with ai removed. For each i, note that Ai lies on the\nboundary of Q, since, by Theorem 4.9, it lies on the boundary of C(m, 2d). Thus, there must be some\n2d-simplex in T |Q which contains Ai . This simplex contains the vertices Ai \u222a B, which amount to 2d + 1\nvertices. Thus this is the complete list of vertices in the simplex. So T |Q contains the simplices Ai \u222a B\nfor all i.\nThese simplices form one of the two triangulations of the convex hull of A \u222a B. Thus Q is the convex\nhull of A \u222a B, and all the boundary d-faces of the convex hull of A \u222a B which are not boundary faces of\nC(m, 2d) are in R \u222a {B}. Since B is not a boundary face of Q, the boundary d-faces of Q are contained\nin R, and therefore are also contained in e(S) = R \u222a {A}. Thus S|Q is the other triangulation of the\nconvex hull of A \u222a B, and S and T are related by a bistellar flip, as desired.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nindecomposable\nProof of Theorem 4.4. Consider Adn as an Adn -module. It is the direct sum of n+d\u22121\nd\n\u0001\nn+d\u22121\nd\nd\nmodules of An , so it corresponds to a\n-subset of In+2d . This subset equals e(S) for some trid\nangulation S of C(n + 2d, 2d). Let\nT\nbe\na\ntriangulation\nobtained by applying a bistellar flip to S. By\n\u0001\nd\nTheorem 4.1, e(T ) is an n+d\u22121\n-subset\nof\nI\nwhich\ncoincides\nwith e(S) except that one element of\nn+2d\nd\ne(S) has been replaced by an element of e(T ). Let X be the Adn -module corresponding to e(T ).\nNow note that Adn is a tilting module. Since ExtdAdn (X, X) = 0, and X is obtained by replacing one\nindecomposable summand of Adn by another indecomposable summand of Adn M , Theorem 3.8 applies to\ntell us that X is also a tilting module.\nThe same argument can be iterated to show that the module corresponding to any triangulation which\ncan be obtained by a sequence of bistellar flips starting from the triangulation corresponding to Adn , is\na tilting module. Theorem 4.3 tells us that any triangulation can be obtained by a sequence of bistellar\nflips starting from any fixed triangulation, so we are done.\nThe second statement (relating bistellar flip to mutation) is immediate from the above discussion. \u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 4.6. Suppose first that A and B are complements to R. This implies that there are\ntriangulations S and T with e(S) = R \u222a {A} and e(T ) = R \u222a {B}. By Theorem 4.1, S and T are related\nby a bistellar flip. Therefore S and T restrict to triangulations of the convex hull of A \u222a B. In particular,\nthis implies that R must contain all the separated (d+ 1)-tuples which correspond to d-faces of the convex\nhull of A \u222a B.\n\u0001\nConversely, suppose that R is a non-intertwining subset of Idm \\ {A, B}, with cardinality m\u2212d\u22121\n\u2212 1,\nd\nand which contains all the separated (d + 1)-tuples from A \u222a B other than A and B. Without loss of\ngenerality, let A \u2240 B, and let A = (a0 , . . . , ad ), B = (b0 , . . . , bd ).\nWe wish to show that R \u222a {A} and R \u222a {B} are non-intertwining. Suppose there is some C \u2208 R such\nthat C \u2240 A. Then C \u2240 (a0 , . . . , ad\u22121 , bd ) \u2208 R, which is contrary to our assumption.\nSuppose there is some C = (c0 , . . . , cd ) \u2208 R such that A \u2240 C. If ci > bi for some i then R \u220b\n(a0 , . . . , ai\u22121 , bi , ai+1 , . . . , ad )\u2240C, which is contrary to our assumption. (Note that the fact that (a0 , . . . , ai\u22121 , bi , ai+1 , . . . , ad )\u2240\nC implies that (a0 , . . . , ai\u22121 , bi , ai+1 , . . . , ad ) is separated, without which we would not know that it is\nin R.) So ai < ci \u2264 bi for all i. Note that there is therefore some index t for which ct < bt , since\nC 6= B.

The same result for R \u222a {B} follows similarly.\n\u0003\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n23\n\n5. The (d + 2)-angulated cluster category\nIn this section we generalize the construction of a (triangulated) cluster category for a hereditary\nrepresentation finite algebra \u039b. More precisely, we will construct a (d + 2)-angulated cluster category for\na d-representation finite algebra \u039b. The (d \u2212 1)-st higher Auslander algebra of linear oriented An is one\nexample of such a d-representation finite algebra (which will be studied in greater detail in Section 6).\nHowever the construction and all the results presented in this section hold for d-representation finite\nalgebras in general, and hence we obtain a generalization of arbitrary cluster categories of hereditary\nrepresentation finite algebras (see [BM+]), not just a generalization of cluster categories of type A.\nRecall (see Definition 3.1) that an algebra is called d-representation finite if it has global dimension\nat most d and its module category contains a d-cluster tilting module. Throughout this section we will\nassume \u039b to be d-representation finite, and we will denote the basic d-cluster tilting module in mod \u039b by\nM.\nIt should be noted that in this case the functors \u03c4d and \u03c4d\u2212 on add M behave very similarly to the\nway the usual Auslander-Reiten translations \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 behave on the module category of a hereditary\nrepresentation finite algebra. For details see [Iya, IO1].\nWe want to mimic the \"usual\" construction of the cluster category, but use add M instead of all of\nmod \u039b. That is, on objects we want our cluster category to be\nadd M \u2228 proj \u039b[d].\nRemark 5.1. In what follows we will be talking about a standard (d + 2)-angulated category O. For a\ndefinition of what we mean precisely by a standard (d + 2)-angulated category, see Definition 5.15. For\nnow, the reader may think of a category together with\n\u2022 an autoequivalence called the d-suspension, denoted by [d], and\n\u2022 a collection of sequences of d+2 morphisms, starting in some object and ending in its d-suspension,\ncalled (d + 2)-angles.\nThe first main result of this section is the existence of a (d + 2)-angulated cluster category with the\ndesired properties. See [Kel] for the triangulated case.\nTheorem 5.2. There is a standard (d + 2)-angulated Krull-Schmidt k-category O\u039b such that\n(1) The isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in O\u039b are in bijection with the indecomposable\ndirect summands of M \u2295 \u039b[d].\n(2) O\u039b is 2d-Calabi-Yau, that is we have a natural isomorphism\nHomO\u039b (X, Y ) = D HomO\u039b (Y, X[2d])\nfor X, Y \u2208 O\u039b . It should be noted that [2d] here is the square of the d-suspension, and not the\n2d-th power of a 1-suspension (in fact, there is no 1-suspension).\n(3) When identifying along the bijection in (1), we have\nHomO\u039b (X, Y [d]) = HomDb (mod \u039b) (X, Y [d]) \u2295 D HomDb (mod \u039b) (Y, X[d])\nfor any X, Y \u2208 add(M \u2295\u039b[d]). In particular HomO\u039b (X, Y [d]) = 0 if and only if both HomDb (mod \u039b) (X, Y [d]) =\n0 and HomDb (mod \u039b) (Y, X[d]) = 0.\nWe have the following definition of cluster tilting objects in O\u039b , which generalizes the classical definition:\nDefinition 5.3. An object T \u2208 O\u039b is called cluster tilting if\n(1) HomO\u039b (T, T [d]) = 0, and\n(2) Any X \u2208 O\u039b occurs in a (d + 2)-angle\nX[\u2212d]\n\nTd\n\nTd\u22121\n\n***\n\nT1\n\nT0\n\nX\n\nwith Ti \u2208 add T .\nRemark 5.4. For d = 1 the above is not the original definition of a cluster tilting object (see [BM+]),\nbut our definition is equivalent to the original definition (see [BMR]). Also see the discussion following\nProposition 8.1 on why we use this definition.\nThe following nice connection between tilting modules in add M and cluster tilting objects in O\u039b\nremains true in this setup (see [BM+] and [ABS] for the triangulated case):\n\n\f24\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nTheorem 5.5. Let T \u2208 add M be a tilting \u039b-module. Then T is a cluster tilting object in O\u039b .\nMoreover, if we set \u0393 := End\u039b (T ), then we have\nEndO\u039b (T ) = \u0393 \u22c9 Ext2d\n\u0393 (D\u0393, \u0393).\nFinally, we will see that we have the following connection from the (d + 2)-angulated cluster category\nto the module category of a cluster tilted algebra. The triangulated cluster category case of this result\nhas been proven in [BMR].\nTheorem 5.6. Let T be a cluster tilting object in O\u039b , and set \u0393 := EndO\u039b (T ). Then the functor\nHomO\u039b (T, \u2212) : O\u039b\n\nmod \u0393\n\ninduces a full faithful embedding\nO\u039b\nmod \u0393,\n(T [d])\nwhere (T [d]) denotes the ideal of all morphisms factoring through add T [d]. The image of this functor\n\u039b\n) is a d-cluster tilting subcategory of mod \u0393.\n(which is then equivalent to (TO[d])\nIn particular \u0393 is weakly d-representation finite in the sense of [IO1], that is, it has a d-cluster tilting\nobject in its module category.\nFinally we have the following description of exchange (d + 2)-angles. (See [BM+] for the exchange\ntriangles in the case when d = 1.)\nTheorem 5.7. Let T be a basic cluster tilting object in O\u039b , T0 an indecomposable direct summand of\nT , and R the sum of the remaining summands of T . Let T0\nR1 be a minimal left R-approximation\nof T0 , and R1\nT0 be a minimal right R-approximation. We consider their minimal completions to\n(d + 2)-angles (see Lemma 5.18)\nR1\n\nT0\nT0 [\u2212d]\n\nY2\nXd+1\n\nY d+1\n\n***\n***\n\nX2\n\nT0 [d], and\nR1\n\nT0 , respectively.\n\nThen the following are equivalent:\n(1) There is an indecomposable T0\u2217 , with T0\u2217 6\u223c\n= T0 such that T0\u2217 \u2295 R is cluster tilting in O\u039b .\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(2) There is an indecomposable T0 , with T0 6\u2208 add T such that HomO\u039b (R, T0\u2217 [d]) = 0.\n(3) Y i \u2208 add R \u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , d}.\n(4) Xi \u2208 add R \u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , d}.\nMoreover, in this case we have T0\u2217 \u223c\n= Xd+1 .\n= Y d+1 \u223c\nRemark 5.8. Note that in the classical cluster category (d = 1), if T is a basic cluster tilting object and\nT0 is an indecomposable summand of it, then there is always a T0\u2217 satisfying the conditions of Theorem 5.7\nsince (3) and (4) are vacuous.\nFor d > 1 this is not the case; in other words, there are typically summands of a cluster tilting object\nwhich cannot be mutated.\n5.1. Background and notation. For triangulated categories, we will denote the suspension by [1], and\nits powers by [i] = [1]i . Moreover, for subcategories A and B we denote by A \u2217 B the full subcategory\nof extensions of an object in A and an object in B, that is\nA \u2217 B = {X | \u2203A\n\nX\n\nB\n\nA[1] with A \u2208 A , B \u2208 B}.\n\nNotation 5.9. Let T be a triangulated category. If T has a Serre functor then it will be denoted by\nT S or just S. Its \u03b4-th desuspension will be denoted by S\u03b4 = S[\u2212\u03b4]. Finally we denote the inverses of\nthese equivalences by S\u2212 and S\u2212\n\u03b4 , respectively.\nDefinition 5.10. Let T be a triangulated category, X a full subcategory, and \u03b4 \u2208 N. Then X is\n\u03b4-cluster tilting if\n\u2022 X is functorially finite in T , and\n\u2022 the subcategory X of T coincides with both\n{T \u2208 T | HomT (X , T [i]) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b4 \u2212 1}}, and\n{T \u2208 T | HomT (T, X [i]) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b4 \u2212 1}}.\nIf add X is a \u03b4-cluster tilting subcategory of T , then we call X a \u03b4-cluster tilting object.\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n25\n\n5.1.1. d-representation finiteness in the derived category.\nTheorem 5.11 (Iyama [Iya]).

Standard (d + 2)-angulated categories. n-angulated categories have been introduced in [GKO].\nIn particular [GKO] gives a construction motivating our definition here.\nBefore we start, we need the following bit of notation: In diagrams, if an arrow is labeled by an integer\ni, then it denotes a morphism to the i-th suspension of the target. For instance X 1\nY means the\nsame thing as X\nY [1].\nDefinition 5.15. A Hom-finite k-category O, together with a d-suspension [d]O and a collection of\ndistinguished (d + 2)-angles, is called standard (d + 2)-angulated if there is a full faithful k-embedding\nT into a triangulated k-category T with Serre functor T S such that\nO\n(1) O is a d-cluster tilting subcategory of T , such that T SO = O.\n(2) [d]O = [d]T .\n(3) A sequence of (d + 2) morphisms\nXd\u22121\n\nX2\nX1\n\nXd\n\nX0\n\nXd+1\n\nd\n\nin O is a distinguished (d + 2)-angle if and only if this diagram can be completed to a diagram\nXd\u22121\n\nX2\nX1\n\n1\n1\n\nT2\n\nTd\u22122\n1\n\nT1\n\nXd\nTd\u22121\n1\n\nX0\n\nd\n\nXd+1\n\nin T , such that all oriented triangles are distinguished triangles, and all non-oriented triangles\nand the lower shape commute.\n\n\f26\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nRemark 5.16. In [GKO] a definition of n-angulated categories in terms of axioms similar to those for\ntriangulated categories is given. Then a standard construction is given, which is shown to always yield\nn-angulated categories. Standard n-angulated categories in the sense of our Definition 5.15 are precisely\nthose n-angulated categories in the sense of [GKO] which result from this standard construction.\nExample 5.17. Let \u039b be a d-representation finite algebra. Then the category U of Theorem 5.11 is\nstandard (d + 2)-angulated.

(This follows from the fact that any short exact sequence in mod \u039b turns into a triangle in\nDb (mod \u039b).)\nLemma 5.18. Let O be a standard (d + 2)-angulated category.\n(1) Any map f : X0\nX1 in O can be completed to a (d+2)-angle X0\nX1\n***\nXd+1\nX0 [d].\nX3 , X3\nX4 , . . ., Xd\nXd+1 to be radical mor(2) If we additionally require the maps X2\nphisms, then the (d + 2)-angle is determined up to (non-unique) isomorphism by the map f . In\nthis case we call the (d + 2)-angle a minimal completion of f to a (d + 2)-angle.\nProof. Both claims follow from the fact that, given f : X0\nX1 , we can determine T1 \u2208 T . Then we\nhave to resolve T1 by objects in the d-cluster tilting subcategory O of T . By general theory of cluster\ntilting subcategories this is possible in d \u2212 1 steps in an essentially unique way.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.19.

Iterating this we end up\nand, by the octahedral axiom we have a triangle H2\nwith a triangle Hd\u22121\nXd+1\nX0 [d]\nHd+1 [1]. Putting these triangles together we obtain the desired\n(d + 2)-angle.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.20. Let O be a standard (d + 2)-angulated category, and T as in Definition 5.15. Then the\nSerre functor T S of T restricts to a Serre functor O S.\nLemma 5.21. Let O be a standard (d + 2)-angulated category, and Y \u2208 O.

By the discussion at the beginning of the\nsection, we want our cluster category to be add M \u2228 proj \u039b[d]. Hence, in U of Theorem 5.11 we identify\nobjects U with Sd [\u2212d]U .\nDefinition 5.22. Let \u039b be a d-representation finite algebra. The (d + 2)-angulated cluster category of \u039b\nis defined to be the orbit category\nO\u039b = U /(Sd [\u2212d]) = U /(S2d ).\nC\u039b2d .\nRemark 5.23. Note that O\u039b comes with an inclusion into Db (mod \u039b)/(S2d )\nSince the subcategory U of Db (mod \u039b) is closed under [d] (by Theorem 5.11) it follows that also O\u039b\nis closed under [d] in C\u039b2d .\nObservation 5.24. With this definition, objects on O\u039b have a unique preimage in add M \u2228 proj \u039b[d].\nThe following theorem shows that our Definition 5.22 makes sense. It says that O\u039b is indeed (d + 2)angulated.\nTheorem 5.25. The subcategory O\u039b \u2286 C\u039b2d is d-cluster tilting. It follows that the category O\u039b is standard\n(d + 2)-angulated (see Definition 5.15).\nWe will give a proof of this theorem in the next subsection. Here we point out that Theorem 5.25\nimplies Theorem 5.2.\nProof of Theorem 5.2, given Theorem 5.25. Theorem 5.25 says that the category O\u039b defined above is\nstandard (d + 2)-angulated. Now (1) is Observation 5.24. (2) follows from the definition of O\u039b (we forced\n[2d] to become a Serre functor). For (3) assume X, Y \u2208 add(M \u2295 \u039b[d]). Then\nM\nHomO\u039b (X, Y [d]) =\nHomU (X, Si2d Y [d])\n(by definition of O\u039b )\ni\u2208Z\n\n= HomU (X, Y [d]) \u2295 HomU (X, S2d Y [d])\n\n(since the other summands vanish)\n\n= HomU (X, Y [d]) \u2295 HomU (X, SY [\u2212d])\n\n(by definition of S2d )\n\n= HomU (X, Y [d]) \u2295 D HomU (Y, X[d])\n\n(since S is a Serre functor)\n\n\u0003\n\nFinally we state the following theorem, which gives us a handle on understanding cluster tilting objects\nin O\u039b . It will be shown in the Subsection 5.5.\nTheorem 5.26. An object T \u2208 O\u039b is cluster tilting (see Definition 5.3), if and only if it is 2d-cluster\ntilting when seen as an object in C\u039b2d .\n5.4. Well-definedness of the (d + 2)-angulated cluster category \u2013 proof of Theorem 5.25. The\naim of this subsection is to verify that O\u039b is indeed a standard (d + 2)-angulated category. To this end\nwe prove Theorem 5.25, saying that it is a d-cluster tilting subcategory of C\u039b2d . Many of the results we\nobtain along the way will also be helpful in studying further properties of O\u039b in the following subsections.\nWe start by verifying that O\u039b satisfies the first property of d-cluster tilting subcategories:\nLemma 5.27. The subcategory O\u039b \u2286 C\u039b2d is d-rigid, that is Hom(O\u039b , O\u039b [i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d.\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2190\n\u2212\nProof. Let X, Y \u2208 O\u039b . We may assume they are the images of X , Y \u2208 add M \u2228 proj \u039b[d]. Then\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212\nHomO\u039b (X, Y [i]) = \u2295j HomU ( X , Sj2d Y [i])\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212\nFor j > 0 we have Sj2d Y [i] lies in positive degree for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , d\u22121}, and hence HomU ( X , Sj2d Y [i]) =\n0.\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2190\n\u2212\nFor j = 0 and i \u2208 {1, . . . , d \u2212 1} we have HomU ( X , Y [i]) = 0 since U is d-rigid.\n\u2190\n\u2212 j \u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2190\n\u2212\nFor j < 0 and i > 0 we have HomU ( X , S2d Y [i]) = HomU ( X , Sjd Y [\u2212dj + i]). Let D<\u2212d denote\nthe subcategory of Db (mod \u039b) of complexes whose homology is concentrated in degrees < \u2212d. Since\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2212dj + i > d we have Sjd Y [\u2212dj + i] \u2208 Sjd D<\u2212d , and since j < 0 we have Sjd D<\u2212d \u2286 D<\u2212d . Therefore\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212\nHomU ( X , Sj2d Y [i]) = 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.28. We will speak about (d + 2)-angles in O\u039b , meaning sequences of morphisms as in Definition 5.15(3), even though for the moment we do not know that O\u039b is standard (d + 2)-angulated.\nIn particular it is not yet clear that any morphism can be completed to a (d + 2)-angle.\nProposition 5.29. The functor U\n\nO\u039b is a (d + 2)-angle functor in the sense that it\n\n\f28\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\n\u2022 commutes with the d-suspension up to a natural isomorphism, and\n\u2022 sends (d + 2)-angles to (d + 2)-angles.\nMoreover it commutes with the respective Serre functors.\nProof. This follows from the fact that U\nO\u039b is the restriction of the functor Db (mod \u039b)\nby [Ami1, Ami2], is a triangle functor and commutes with the Serre functors.\nCorollary 5.30. Any map in the image of the functor U\nO\u039b .\n\nC\u039b2d , which,\n\u0003\n\nO\u039b can be completed to a (d + 2)-angle in\n\nProof. Since U is standard (d + 2)-angulated (Example 5.17), a preimage of our map in U can be\n\u0003\ncompleted to a (d + 2)-angle in U . Now the claim follows from Proposition 5.29.\nCorollary 5.31. Let X \u2208 O\u039b . Then any map \u03c6 \u2208 SocO\u039b HomO\u039b (X, O SX) \\ {0} can be completed to a\n(d + 2)-angle in O\u039b . In this case we call this (d + 2)-angle an almost split (d + 2)-angle, and say that X\nhas an almost split (d + 2)-angle.\nThe strategy for the remainder of this subsection is as follows: We show at the same time that O\u039b is\nd-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d , and that its image in the module category of a cluster tilted algebra is d-cluster\ntilting (Theorem 5.6). However, since Theorem 5.26 is not proven yet, we assume that we are given a fixed\nT \u2208 O\u039b which is 2d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d . We set \u0393 = EndO\u039b (T ). We denote by M = HomO\u039b (T, O\u039b )\nthe image of O\u039b under the functor HomC\u039b2d (T, \u2212) : C\u039b2d\nmod \u0393.\nProposition 5.32.

We take approximation triangles as\nin Lemma 5.35 for X, and similarly (with Ti\u2032 instead of Ti ) for Y . Clearly the map \u03c6 induces maps\non the projective resolutions. Using Lemma 5.35 and the fact that maps between modules of the form\nHomC\u039b2d (T, T \u2032 ) with T \u2032 \u2208 add T are representable we find maps ti : Ti\nTi\u2032 as in the following commutative diagram.\nTd\u22121\nTd\ntd\n\n1\n\nXd\u22121\n\ntd\u22121\n\n1\n\n1\n\nT1\n***\n\nXd\u22122\n\ntd\u22122\n\n\u2032\nTd\u22121\n\nTd\u2032\n\n***\n\nTd\u22122\n\n1\n\nX1\nt1\n\n\u2032\nTd\u22122\n\nYd\u22121\n\nT0\n\nYd\u22122\n\n***\n\nX0\n\nX\n\nY0\n\nY\n\nt0\n\nT1\u2032\n\n***\n\n1\n\nT0\u2032\nY1\n\n1\n\nYi from left to right such that the resulting diagram is still commutative.\nWe now construct maps fi : Xi\nAssume the maps fd\u22121 , . . . , fi+1 have already been constructed, and make all the squares they are involved\nin commutative.

It then follows that\nO\u039b is d-cluster tilting.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 5.25. The first statement is contained in Corollary 5.38. For the second statement it\nonly remains to show that O\u039b is closed under C\u039b2d S. This follows from the facts that U is closed under\nb\nC\u039b2d commutes with the respective Serre\nDb (mod \u039b) S by Theorem 5.11, and the projection D (mod \u039b)\nfunctors by [Ami1, Ami2].\n\u0003\n5.5. Cluster tilting objects. The first aim of this section is to prove Theorem 5.26, saying that cluster\ntilting objects in O\u039b are precisely the 2d-cluster tilting objects in C\u039b2d which lie in O\u039b .\nProof of Theorem 5.26. Assume T is a 2d-cluster tilting object in C\u039b2d , such that T \u2208 O\u039b . It is part of the\ndefinition that HomO\u039b (T, T [d]) = HomC\u039b2d (T, T [d]) = 0, hence we only have to check (2) of Definition 5.3\nin order to show that T is cluster tilting. This however is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.35 (and\nthe definition of (d + 2)-angles).\nNow assume conversely that T is cluster tilting in O\u039b in the sense of Definition 5.3. It follows that\nHomC\u039b2d (T, T [i]) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , 2d \u2212 1}: For i = d this is Definition 5.3(1), for i 6= d it follows since\nT \u2208 O\u039b . It follows that (add T [i]) \u2217 (add T ) = add(T \u2295 T [i]) for i \u2208 {0, . . . , 2d \u2212 2}. Now note that\nC\u039b2d = O\u039b \u2217 O\u039b [1] \u2217 * * * \u2217 O\u039b [d \u2212 1]\n= ((add T ) \u2217 * * * \u2217 (add T )[d]) \u2217 * * * \u2217 ((add T ) \u2217 * * * \u2217 (add T )[d])[d \u2212 1]\nwhere the first equality comes from the fact that O\u039b is d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d , and the second one follows\nfrom Definition 5.3(2). Repeatedly applying the above observation we see that this is\n(add T ) \u2217 * * * \u2217 (add T [2d \u2212 1]).\nHence T is 2d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d .\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.39. Let T \u2208 add M be a tilting \u039b-module. Then T \u2208 O\u039b is cluster tilting.\nProof. Since gl.dim \u039b \u2264 d we have gl.dim End(T ) \u2264 2d. Hence it follows from Theorem 5.14 that T \u2208 C\u039b2d\nis 2d-cluster tilting. Now the claim follows from Theorem 5.26.\n\u0003\nNote that the above Corollary is the first statement of Theorem 5.5. We now complete its proof.\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n31\n\nProof of Theorem 5.5. We have just seen that T is cluster tilting in O\u039b . Now, by [Ami1, Ami2] we know\nthat EndC\u039b2d (T ) is the tensor algebra of Ext2d\n\u0393 (D\u0393, \u0393) over \u0393, and moreover that\n\u2297i\nExt2d\n= HomDb (mod \u0393) (\u0393, S\u2212i\n\u0393 (D\u0393, \u0393)\n2d \u0393).\n\nSince T is a tilting \u039b-module we may identify along the equivalence R Hom\u039b (T, \u2212) : Db (mod \u039b)\nand obtain\n\nDb (mod \u0393)\n\n\u2297i\nExt2d\n= HomDb (mod \u039b) (T, S\u2212i\n\u0393 (D\u0393, \u0393)\n2d T ).\n\nThe claim now follows since this space vanishes for i 6\u2208 {0, 1}.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe conclude this subsection by summing up that we have also proven Theorem 5.6.\nProof of Theorem 5.6. By Theorem 5.26 a cluster tilting object in O\u039b is a 2d-cluster tilting object in\nC\u039b2d . Hence we are in the situation of Subsection 5.4. Now the claim follows from Theorem 5.37.\n\u0003\n5.6. Exchange (d + 2)-angles \u2013 proof of Theorem 5.7. Throughout this section we assume T to be\na cluster tilting object in O\u039b . We start by proving the easy implications of Theorem 5.7.\nFirst note that the implication (1) =\u21d2 (2) follows immediately from the definition of cluster tilting.\nProof of Theorem 5.7, (3) =\u21d2 (1) or (4) =\u21d2 (1). Since (1) has no preference for left or right, the proofs\nof (3) =\u21d2 (1) and (4) =\u21d2 (1) are the same. Hence we may restrict to the latter situation here. So assume\nwe have a (d + 2)-angle as in (4). By definition this comes from a diagram\nXd\u22121\n\nX2\nHd\u22122\n\nXd\n\nH2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nHd\u22121\n\nR1\nH1\n\n1\n1\n\nXd+1\n\nd\n\nT0\n\nin C\u039b2d . By Theorem 5.26 we know that T0 \u2295 R is basic 2d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d . Then it follows from\nclassical mutation of cluster tilting objects iteratively that H1 \u2295 R is basic 2d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d , then\nthat H2 \u2295 R is basic 2d-cluster tilting in C\u039b2d , and so on. We conclude that Xd+1 \u2295 R is a basic 2d-cluster\ntilting object in C\u039b2d . Since it lies in O\u039b , it follows from Theorem 5.26 that Xd+1 \u2295 R is cluster tilting in\nO\u039b . Finally note that, since T0 6\u2208 add R, the map R1\nT0 is not split epi. Hence the map T0\nXd+1 [d]\nin the above (d + 2)-angle does not vanish, and in particular T0 \u223c\n6 Xd+1 .\n\u0003\n=\nFor the proof of the final implications of Theorem 5.7 we need the following observations.\nLemma 5.40.

By Theorem 5.11 an\nindecomposable object in U is of the form Sid P , for some indecomposable projective \u039b-module P and\ni \u2208 Z.

If neither (i0 , . . . , id ) \u2240\n(j0 , . . . , jd ) nor (j0 , . . . , jd ) \u2240 (i0 , . . . , id ) then T \u2295 Oi0 ,...,id \u2295 Oj0 ,...,jd has no d-self-extensions, contradicting\nthe fact that T \u2295 Oi0 ,...,id is a cluster tilting object.\nOi0 ,...,id [d] (for (a)) and\nFor (3) note that the existence of an essentially unique map Oj0 ,...,jd\nOi0 ,...,id\nOj0 ,...,jd [d] (for (b)) follows from Proposition 6.1. By Lemma 5.18 these maps can be minimally\ncompleted to (d + 2)-angles in an essentially unique way. We postpone the proof that these essentially\nunique minimal completions have the form described in the theorem to Proposition 6.11. By the final\nstatement of Theorem 5.7 we know that in the (d + 2)-angles of that theorem we have Oj0 ,...,jd \u223c\n=\n= Y d+1 \u223c\nXd+1 .

Now by Theorem 5.7(3 and 4) all the middle\nterms Er and Fr of these (d + 2)-angles lie in add T .

(a) Special case I: Oi0 ,...,id = Oj0 ,...,jd [\u2212d]. In this case any non-zero map Oj0 ,...,jd\nOi0 ,...,id [d]\nis an isomorphism, and hence the other terms of the (d + 2)-angle should vanish.

Now\nmX ((i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd )) = mX ((1, j0 + 1, . . . , jd\u22121 + 1), (j0 , . . . , jd\u22121 , n + 2d + 1)),\nand hence mX ((i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd )) \u2208 Idn+2d+1 only for X \u2208 {\u2205, {0, . . . , d}}. Thus (a) holds for\nOi0 ,...,id = Oj0 ,...,jd [\u2212d].\nSpecial case II: jd \u2264 n + 2d (and hence also id \u2264 n + 2d). Then (i0 , . . . , id ), (j0 , . . . , jd ) \u2208 Idn+2d ,\nand by Proposition 3.19 there is an exact sequence\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2212\nEd\nE1\n***\nMj0 ,...,jd\nMi0 ,...,id\nin mod Adn , with\n\n\u2190\n\u2212\nEr =\n\nM\n\nMmX ((i0 ,...,id ),(j0 ,...,jd )) .\n\nX\u2286{0,...,d}\n|X|=r\nmX ((i0 ,...,id ),(j0 ,...,jd ))\u2208Id\nn+2d\n\nBy Example 5.17 this turns into a (d + 2)-angle in U , and hence, by Proposition 5.29, also into a (d + 2)angle in OAdn . Since during this transfer MmX ((i0 ,...,id ),(j0 ,...,jd )) turns into OmX ((i0 ,...,id ),(j0 ,...,jd )) , the\nclaim follows.\nGeneral case: If jd \u2264 n + 2d, then we can apply special case II. So suppose otherwise, namely, that\njd = n + 2d + 1.\nIf i0 = 1 and it = jt\u22121 + 1 for all 1 \u2264 t \u2264 d then we can appy special case I. Thus we may assume that\neither i0 > 1 or that there is t such that it > jt\u22121 + 1.\nAssume first that i0 > 1.

Tropical cluster exchange relations\nDefine a generalized lamination to be a finite collection of increasing (d + 1)-tuples from R \\ {1, . . . , m},\nsuch that no two intertwine. We can also think of a generalized lamination as a collection of d-simplices\nin R2d with vertices on the moment curve, which do not intersect in their interiors; the increasing (d + 1)tuple (b0 , . . . , bd ) corresponds to the convex hull of the points pbi . We denote by L the set of all generalized\nlaminations.\nFor each increasing (d + 1)-tuple A from {1, . . . , m} we define a function IA : L\nN by setting IA (L)\nto be the number of elements of L which intertwine with A (in some order). This is also equal to the\nnumber of intersections of the simplex A with the simplices defined by the lamination. In this section we\nshow that these functions satisfy certain tropical exchange relations which we shall define, and in which\nthe functions IA for A 6\u2208 Idm function as frozen variables (in other words, they cannot be mutated).\nIn the case that d = 1, this was shown by Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein [GSV]. ([GSV] considers\nmore general situations, where the polygon is replaced by other surfaces. See also the work of Fomin and\nThurston [FT] for another perspective and further extensions of this.)\nThe next theorem gives the tropical exchange relation between IA and IB where A and B are exchangeable.\nTheorem 7.1.

We do not know how to obtain a meaningful analogue of this for d > 1.\nNote that for d > 1, (5) is not a tropical cluster algebra relation, because of the signs. When d = 2,\nwe get, for example, the following exchange relation:\nI024 \u2212 I135 = max(I124 + I034 + I025 \u2212 I134 \u2212 I125 \u2212 I035 ,\nI245 + I014 + I023 \u2212 I013 \u2212 I145 \u2212 I235 )\nThis is not a normal tropical cluster algebra relation because the exchanged variables appear with\nopposite signs on the lefthand side, and the two tropical monomials on the righthand side each include a\nmixture of signs.\nThere is a term in (5) for each summand of each term of the exchange (d + 2)-angles for OA and OB\nin OAdm\u22122d\u22121 (see Theorem 6.3), but (5) also includes terms corresponding to (d + 1)-tuples which are not\nseparated.\nThe statement of Theorem 7.1 was chosen for maximum uniformity. It follows from the proof that, if\nd is even, then the two terms inside the max(*, *) are equal, so the theorem could be stated more simply\nin this case.\n7.1. Proof of Theorem 7.1. Let l be an increasing (d + 1)-tuple of non-integers, l = (l0 , . . . , ld ). We\nwill also write l for the generalized lamination consisting only of l. We begin by considering (5) on\ngeneralized laminations of the form l.\nProposition 7.2. Let A and B be exchangeable (d + 1)-tuples such that A \u2240 B, and let l be as above.\nThen exactly one of the following happens:\nX\n(\u22121)|X| ImX (A,B) (l) = 0, or\n(1)\nX\u2286{0,...,d}\n\n(2) d is odd, and ai < li < bi for all i.\nProof. Suppose first that lk < ak for some k. It follows that if l intertwines mX (A, B) in either order, it\nmust be that l \u2240 mX (A, B) (rather than the reverse). If, for any i we have li > bi , then li > ai as well,\nso all the terms in (1) are zero. Similarly, if li < ai\u22121 for any i, all the terms in (1) are zero. Hence we\nmay disregard these cases.\nSo, for each i 6= k, there are three possibilities:\n\n\f38\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\n\u2022 ai\u22121 < li < bi\u22121\n\u2022 bi\u22121 < li < ai\n\u2022 ai < l i < b i\nIn the first case, in order for ImX (A,B) (l) to be nonzero, we must have i \u2212 1 \u2208 X. In the third case, we\nmust have i 6\u2208 X.\nIf k = 0, then the above conditions are sufficient. If k 6= 0, we also have two possibilities regarding lk :\n\u2022 ak\u22121 < lk < bk\u22121\n\u2022 bk\u22121 < lk < ak\nIn the first case, we must have k \u2212 1 \u2208 X.\nIf X satisfies all the above criteria, then l \u2240 mX (A, B). This implies that the non-zero values for\nImX (A,B) (l) are precisely those such that X satisfies Xmin \u2286 X \u2286 Xmax , for certain specific Xmin and\nXmax . If Xmin 6= Xmax , then the sum will be zero. So suppose otherwise. The above conditions must\ntherefore have specified X precisely. We must therefore have k 6= 0, and we must have k \u2212 1 \u2208 X.\nConsider i = k \u2212 1. It must have contributed some condition, which cannot contradict the previous\ncondition, so it must have imposed k \u2212 2 \u2208 X. Proceeding similarly, we see that i = 1 must impose the\ncondition that 0 \u2208 X, and then there is no further (non-contradictory) condition which can be imposed\nby i = 0. Thus, Xmin 6= Xmax , and the sum is zero.\nThe case that there is some k with lk > bk is dealt with similarly.\nThe remaining case is when ak < lk < bk . In this case, the only two nonzero terms in (1) are IA (l)\nand IB (l). If d is even, they have opposite signs and cancel out; otherwise, they do not cancel, and we\nare in the situation of (2).\n\u0003\nThe following proposition is proved the same way:\nProposition 7.3. Let A and B be exchangeable (d + 1)-tuples such that A \u2240 B, and let l be as above.\nThen exactly one of the following happens:\nX\n(\u22121)|X| InX (A,B) (l) = 0, or\n(1)\nX\u2286{0,...,d}\n\n(2) d is odd, and bi\u22121 < li < ai for all i (where the condition that b\u22121 < l0 is considered to be\nvacuously true).\nWe say that l is in m-special position (n-special position) with respect to the pair A, B if it satisfies\nCondition (2) of Proposition 7.2 (of Proposition 7.3).\nProof of Theorem 7.1. Consider (5) applied on l. By the above two propositions, if d is even, or if l is\nneither in m- nor n-special position, then the contribution from l to both sides of (5) are equal and,\nfurther, the two terms being maximized are also equal. In the remaining case (d odd and l in m- or\nn-special position), one checks that the lefthand side of (5) is 1, while the terms on the righthand side\nare \u22121 and 1.\nNow we consider (5) on an arbitrary generalized lamination L. As already observed, the simplices in\nL which are neither in m- nor n-special position with respect to A, B give equal contributions to the\nleft-hand side of (5) and to each of the terms of the maximum on the right-hand side, so they can be\nignored. If d is even, we are done also. Otherwise, note that L cannot have both elements which are\nin m-special position and elements which are in n-special position, since these would intertwine. Thus,\nonly one of the two special positions is allowed, and the contributions from all the terms of L in special\nposition therefore appear, with positive sign, in the same term in the maximum. Thus the equality of\nthe theorem holds.\n\u0003\n8. Higher dimensional phenomena\nIn this section we report on some phenomena appearing in the classical d = 1 case which do not persist\nfor larger values of d. In the d = 1 case, a maximal rigid object in OAdn is cluster tilting. We give examples\nshowing that, for any d \u2265 3, this statement does not always hold. Specifically, we show the following:\nProposition 8.1. For d \u2265 3, there exist maximal non-intertwining subsets of\nthe overall maximal size.\n\nId2d+3 which are not of\n\nIn the setup of the cluster categories of Section 5 the proposition implies that, for d \u2265 3, there are\nmaximal rigid objects in OAd2 which are not cluster tilting.\n\n\fHIGHER DIMENSIONAL CLUSTERS\n\n39\n\nA maximal non-intertwining subset of Id2d+3 consists of all the elements of Id2d+3 \\ Id2d+3 together\nwith a maximal non-intertwining subset of Id2d+3 (since the elements of Id2d+3 \\ Id2d+3 contain both 1\nand 2d + 3, and therefore do not intertwine any element of Id2d+3 ). It follows that the statement of the\nproposition also holds with Id2d+3 replacing Id2d+3 . In the representation-theoretic terms of Section 3\nthis restatement of the proposition implies that for d \u2265 3 there exist partial tilting modules for Ad3 which\ncannot be extended to a tilting module in add M3d .\nComputer experiments have not detected any similar phenomena when d = 2.\nWe also consider the simplicial complex \u2206dn with vertex set Idn+2d+1 , whose maximal faces correspond\nto the internal simplices of triangulations of C(n + 2d + 1, 2d), or equivalently, to cluster tilting objects\nin OAdn .\nGiven a simplicial complex \u2206 on a vertex set V , we say that vertices v and w are compatible if {v, w}\nis a face of \u2206. We then say that \u2206 is a clique complex if its faces consist of all pairwise compatible\nsubsets of V . In the classical setting, \u22061n is a clique complex; this is a combinatorial expression of the\nstatement we have already recalled that cluster tilting objects and maximal rigid objects coincide in the\nclassical cluster category. In these terms, Proposition 8.1 says that \u2206d2 is not a clique complex for d \u2265 3.\nIt is natural to ask about the topology of \u2206dn . Many simplicial complexes which arise in the context\nof algebraic combinatorics are shellable. We recall the precise definition in Subsection 8.1; the point is\nthat if a simplicial complex is shellable, then its homotopy type admits a very simple description. It\nis classical that \u22061n is shellable, because it can be realized as the boundary of a convex polytope, the\n(simple) associahedron [Lee], and the boundary of a simplicial convex polytope is shellable [BrM].\nOur result in this direction is a negative one:\nProposition 8.2. For d \u2265 2, the complex \u2206d2 is not shellable.\n8.1. Proofs for Section 8. The elements of Id2d+3 can be arranged in a cycle, in such a fashion that\nany (d + 1)-tuple is compatible with any other one except the two which are maximally distant from it.\nThe overall maximal size of a non-intertwining collection is d + 1; the non-intertwining collections of that\nsize consist of d + 1 consecutive entries around the cycle.\nFor d = 3, the resulting cycle is below:\n3579\n\n1357\n\n2579\n\n1358\n\n2479\n\n1368\n\n2469\n\n1468\n2468\n\nProof of Proposition 8.1. If d \u2265 3, it is possible to choose three (d + 1)-tuples in Id2d+3 which are\npairwise non-intertwining, but which do not all lie in any consective sequence of length d + 1. Therefore,\nthis collection cannot be extended to a collection of d + 1 non-intertwining elements of Id2d+3 .\nFor example, for d = 3, we could choose {1357, 1468, 2479} as our starting collection; it is impossible\nto increase it to a non-intertwining collection of size d + 1 = 4.\n\u0003\nA simplicial complex is called d-dimensional if all its maximal faces contain d + 1 vertices.\nDefinition 8.3. For d > 0, a d-dimensional simplicial complex is called shellable\nS if its maximal faces\nadmit an order F1 , . . . , Fp such that for all i > 1, the intersection of Fi with j<i Fj is a non-empty\nunion of codimension one faces of Fi .\nIf a d-dimensional simplicial complex is shellable, then it is either contractible or homotopic to the\nwedge product of some number of d-dimensional spheres, [Bj\u00f6, Theorem 1.3].\nProof of Proposition 8.2. The simplicial complex \u2206d2 is d-dimensional. Therefore, if \u2206d2 were shellable, it\nwould necessarily either be contractible or be homotopic to a wedge of some number of d-spheres.\n\n\f40\n\nSTEFFEN OPPERMANN AND HUGH THOMAS\n\nThe cycle defined above on the vertices of \u2206d2 , viewed as a one-dimensional simplicial complex, is a\nsubcomplex of \u2206d2 , and \u2206d2 admits a deformation retract to it. Thus \u2206d2 is homotopic to S 1 . It follows\nthat for d \u2265 2 it is not shellable.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[Ami1] Claire Amiot.
