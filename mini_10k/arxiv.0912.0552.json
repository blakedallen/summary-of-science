We report the latest results of a search for dark matter in\nthe form of relic sterile neutrinos (see Kusenko 2009 for an up-to-date review). The motivation for considering the sterile neutrino, one of a number of feasible dark-matter candidates,\nis two-fold. First, the discovery of ordinary neutrino masses is most easily accommodated by\nmeans of the so-called seesaw mechanism, which calls for some new gauge-singlet fermions.\nIf all of these fermions have very large Majorana masses, there are no additional degrees\nof freedom (particles) at the low energy scale. However, if one of these mass parameters\nlies in the 1\u201330 keV range, the corresponding sterile neutrino can be the long sought-after\ndark matter particle (Dodelson & Widrow 1994). Second, the physics of supernovae, that\noften assists in ruling out hypothetical low-mass particles, provides some intriguing clues\nin favor of the existence of sterile neutrinos with the same parameters that are required to\nexplain dark matter. Such particles would be anisotropically emitted from a cooling newly\nborn neutron star, inducing a sufficient recoil momentum in the neutron star to explain\nthe observed velocities of pulsars (Kusenko & Segr\u00e8 1997; Fuller et al. 2003). X-ray observations offer the best probe of this well-motivated dark-matter candidate (Kusenko 2009).\nIn the early universe, sterile neutrinos may be produced through non-resonant oscillations\n(Dodelson & Widrow 1994), resonant oscillations (Shi & Fuller 1999) and via various other\nchannels (Kusenko 2006; Shaposhnikov & Tkachev 2006; Petraki & Kusenko 2008). The kinetic properties of dark matter relevant for structure formation on small scales (i.e., how\n\"warm\" or \"cold\" the dark matter is) depend on the production scenario, as well as the\nparticle mass (Kusenko 2006; Petraki 2008; Boyanovsky 2008b).\nThe generic prediction is that relic sterile neutrinos must decay into a lighter neutrino\nand a photon (Pal & Wolfenstein 1982). Since this two-body decay of a 1\u201330 keV mass\nparticle produces a narrow line with energy E\u03b3 = mst c2 /2, X-ray astronomy provides a\nunique opportunity to discover these relic particles. Archival X-ray data has been used to\nset limits on relic sterile neutrinos (see the review in Kusenko 2009). In addition, a dedicated\nsearch for sterile neutrinos using the Suzaku X-ray telescope has recently been conducted\nby Loewenstein, Kusenko, & Biermann (2009) (hereafter, LKB). Here we will present new\nresults from the search using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our analysis of data on\nthe Willman 1 dwarf spheroidal galaxy yields evidence of a 2.5 keV line, consistent with the\ndecay of a relic sterile neutrino with mass 5 keV; and, with an inferred line strength consistent\nwith that expected if all of the dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos produced by\noscillations.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.2.\n\nTarget selection\n\nGiven the uncertainty in sterile neutrino properties, and the importance of dark matter\ndiscovery, one ought to explore the X-ray band with existing instruments using well-chosen\ntargets. While the decay timescale greatly exceeds the Hubble time (Pal & Wolfenstein\n1982; Barger et al. 1995), the emissivity may reach detectable levels in regions of large dark\nmatter surface density, such as galaxy clusters, M31, and Local Group dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (Abazajian et al. 2001a,b; Dolgov & Hansen 2002; Boyarsky et al. 2006). The last\noffer, arguably, the most promising opportunity because of the proximity and high dark matter density in these systems, and the absence of additional competing internal X-ray sources.\nSuzaku Observing Cycle 2 observing time was awarded time to study the best available\ntargets at that time: the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidals (LKB). Subsequently, a\nnew sub-population of faint Milky Way satellites discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) were found to have very high mass-to-light ratios (Strigari et al. 2008a; Walker et al.\n2009). These rival or surpass Ursa Minor and Draco as compelling targets for sterile neutrino\nsearches. We were awarded 100 ks of observing time in Chandra cycle 10 to investigate one of\nthese \u2013 namely Willman 1. These data represent the first X-ray observations of this extreme\nsystem; and, we report on our findings here.\n\n1.3.\n\nPrevious Results on Ursa Minor\n\nThe basic equations relating the galaxy parameters (distance 100d100 kpc, dark matter\nmass in projection Mpro = 107 M7 M\u2299 ), X-ray observables (line energy E\u03b3 , line flux Fline ),\nand sterile neutrino parameters (mass mst , mixing angle \u03b8, fraction of dark matter in sterile\nneutrinos fst ), are the following (Loewenstein et al. 2009, Kusenko 2009, and references\ntherein):\nmst = 2E\u03b3 ,\n(1)\n\u0012 2 \u0013 \u0010\n\u0011\nsin \u03b8\nmst 5\n\u0393\u03bds \u2192\u03b3\u03bda = 5.52 \u00d7 10\u221232\n,\n(2)\n10\u221210\nkeV\nand\nFline = 4.69 \u00d7 10\n= 5.15 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22126\n\n\u221210\n\n\u0393\u221227 fst M7 d\u22122\n100\n\u0012\n\nsin2 \u03b8\n10\u221210\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\n\u0012\n\nkeV\nE\u03b3\n\n\u0013\n\nmst \u00114\n\u22122 \u22121\nfst M7 d\u22122\ns .\n100 photons cm\nkeV\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe abundance of sterile neutrinos produced through non-resonant oscillations may be calculated for given values of mst and \u03b8, assuming the standard early thermal history of the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nuniverse. This relation determines fst as a function of mst and \u03b8, assuming that all sterile\nneutrinos are produced in this way as first proposed by Dodelson & Widrow (1994), and\nlower limits on fst if there is some non-negligible lepton asymmetry (Shi & Fuller 1999) or if\nsome other production channels contributed more than the oscillations to the sterile neutrino\nrelic abundance (Kusenko 2009).\nLKB did not detect a sterile neutrino emission line in Ursa Minor Suzaku spectra. The\nline flux upper limit was used to derive an excluded region in the mst \u2212 \u03b8 plane for the case\nwhere all of the dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos. A more general constraint\nwas inferred from the condition that the line flux upper limit not be overproduced through\noscillations at the sterile neutrino relic density corresponding to each pair (mst , \u03b8). We\nderived line flux upper limits using a maximum-likelihood approach that, along with the\nlack of intrinsic X-ray emission, enabled us to minimize systematics, and account for those\nthat remained. The resulting constraints on sterile neutrinos are illustrated in Figure 9\nof LKB. Although the constraints from this single Suzaku observation are comparable to\nprevious results over the entire 1\u201320 keV mass, the allowed range does not rule out sterile\nneutrinos as a viable dark matter candidate. We therefore expanded our search to the\nWillman 1 system \u2013 conducting the first X-ray observation of one of the new SDSS dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies. The capabilities of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory are well-suited to\nthe compact size of Willman 1; and, these data provide a good complement to the broader\nbeam observations of the more extended classical Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (Section 4.2).\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData Analysis\n\nObservation and Data Processing\n\nWillman 1 (Chandra ObsID 10534, SeqNum 600727) was observed by Chandra on January 27-28 2009 for 102745.5 seconds. The data was taken in TIMED VFAINT mode, and\nwas pipeline-processed on 2009-2-10 using ascdsver 7.6.11.10. We use CIAO version 4.1.2\n(CALDB 4.1.4), and XSPEC version 12.5 in our analysis. Chips 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 were on\nduring the observation. Willman 1 was positioned at the ACIS-I aimpoint, and we generally\nrestrict our analysis to the I-array (chips 0-3) data.\nWe analyze the standard level 2 event file, and also reprocess the level 1 event file in\norder to implement the VFAINT data-mode quiescent background reduction technique.1 For\nthe latter, likely background events are flagged based on the pulse heights in border pixels of\n1\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/aciscleanvf\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe 5x5 pixel event islands; default split threshold and trail parameters are adopted. These\nevents, as well as those corresponding to bad grades, are removed as the new level 2 event file\nis generated. No flares are found upon examination of the light curves; and, time intervals\nwhere the count rate deviates by more than 10% of the mean are excised. The final exposure\ntimes are 99400 and 97100 seconds for the cleaned pipeline processed and reprocessed event\nfiles, respectively.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Background\n\nWe consider off-axis (S2, i.e. chip 6), blank sky, and stowed data sets as candidates for\nconstructing background spectra. The last corresponds to events collected with the ACIS\nstowed while the HRC-I is in the focal plane; and, has been demonstrated to be consistent\nwith the dark moon.2 That is, it can provide an estimate of the pure particle background\n(PB). In contrast, the blank sky and S2 data include the cosmic (CXB) and galactic (GXB)\nX-ray backgrounds (which vary over the sky, especially the GXB). The blank sky and stowed\nevent files are reprojected using the Willman 1 aspect solution. The quiescent PB reduction\nprocedure may also be applied to these background event files. If dark matter is composed of\nsterile neutrinos, their presence in the Milky Way results in line emission in the S2 and blank\nsky data that will reduce the signal if subtracted out as background. Additionally, the S2 chip\nis still within the solid angle subtended by the Willman 1 dark halo (see below). Therefore,\nour constraints are derived from the PB-subtracted spectra from which no astrophysical\nsources of extended X-ray emission have been eliminated.\n\n2.3.\n\nSpectral Analysis Setup\n\nSource and background spectra are extracted from identical 5\u2032 circular apertures centered on the Willman 1 position or its equivalent in detector coordinates, except for the S2\nchip background spectrum that is extracted from a 3\u2032 circle optimized in a way that accounts\nfor chip uniformity and point sources near the edge of the chip. The S2 chip center is 15\u2032\n(165 pc) from the position of Willman 1, and lies outside the region where stellar velocities\nare measured. The allowed dark matter profile thus spans a large range: the average surface\nmass density in this field may be as large as \u223c 50%, or as small as \u223c 10%, that in the central\nI-array extraction region. Regions corresponding to point sources detected in the Willman\n1 image via application of the CIAO wavelet point source detection algorithm are excluded.\n2\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/maxim/stowed/\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nBackground spectra are re-scaled based on the relative count rates in the 9-12 keV band\nwhere virtually all events are due to the PB. The PB has been found to vary significantly in\nnormalization, but not in shape, so that the rescaled PB spectra can be used to construct\nan appropriate PB-subtracted source spectrum.3\n\n2.4.\n\nSpectral Analysis\n\nIn our analysis of the Suzaku data on the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, we based\nour constraints on the total (unsubtracted) spectrum. Because the Chandra PB is higher,\nbut more precisely determined, we adopt a more conventional approach here and consider\nbackground-subtracted spectra, grouped to a minimum of 15 counts per bin, utilizing \u03c72\nstatistics to derive best fits and parameter uncertainties.\nThe cleanest PB subtraction is realized utilizing the source and stowed background spectra with application of the VFAINT data-mode quiescent background reduction technique,\nalthough using the corresponding pipeline-processed datasets yielded similar results (with\nslightly larger uncertainties). The source spectrum is fitted with a model consisting of a\nsolar abundance thermal plasma (to model the GXB) and power-law (to model the CXB)\nabsorbed by the Galactic column density. In this case the GXB component is not required,\nalthough the upper limit on the flux is consistent with the larger-scale average GXB surface\nbrightness measured in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The best-fit (\u03c72 /\u03bd = 1.09) power-law\nphoton index is 1.8 (1.4-2.7 at 90% confidence), and the normalization consistent with the\nfraction of the CXB unresolved by our observation (\u223c 25%; Mushotzky et al. 2000). Figures\n1a and 1b show the total, (stowed) background, and background-subtracted spectra for cases\nutilizing pipeline-processed, and reprocessed (reduced-background) event lists. The best-fit\npower-law model, and fit residuals, are also shown. We show the full 0.3-12 keV energy\nband, although the fits are conducted over 0.4-7 keV. There are PB-related residuals in the\nbackground-subtracted spectrum above 7 keV where the Chandra sensitivity experiences a\nsteep decline. Some of these persistent residuals may be attributed to the fact that the\ntime-dependent gain correction cannot be re-applied to the background data, as was done\nwith the source data.\nThe blank-sky background (SB) is significantly brighter than the source spectrum below\n1 keV. The total PB-subtracted 0.4-7 keV surface brightness is \u2248 1.7\u00d7 higher in the SB than\nin Willman 1. Evidently the GXB is brighter in the former and, as a result, the SB-subtracted\nspectrum ought to be utilized with care (Figure 2).

The high\nenergy segment best-fit (\u03c72 /\u03bd = 1.11) power-law slope is 1.77 (1.22-2.37 at 90%, confidence).\n2\nAt low energies, power-law (\u03c72 /\u03bd = 0.95, slope = 2.27\u22121.09\n+1.39 ) and thermal apec (\u03c7 /\u03bd = 0.92,\nkT = 0.48 \u00b1 0.15 keV) models provide acceptable fits. We conduct Monte Carlo numerical\nexperiments (LKB, and references therein) where we find that, in fits to simulated continua\nspectra with models that include an emission line, the fit is improved by \u2206\u03c72 = 9.2 with \u223c 1%\nfrequency \u2013 closely approximating that for a \u03c72 distribution with two degrees of freedom. We\nthus adopt \u2206\u03c72 = 9.2 flux limits, derived from adding an unresolved Gaussian component\nin 10 eV intervals over the 0.4-7 keV bandpass to simulated spectra of the best-fit line-free\nmodel. The errors are averages over 100 simulations that are initiated using parameters from\nfits to a seed simulation (and not the best-fit parameters to the actual data), so that the\nuncertainties in the parameter values are taken into account. Line fluxes are allowed to go\nnegative (as is the case with the simulations). The upper and lower line flux limits, in 200\neV bins, based on the PB-subtracted fits are shown in Figure 3. The latter are negative over\nthe entire 0.4-7 keV bandpass. The constraints based on the SB-subtracted fits are similar\nin magnitude above 2 keV.\nThe mapping of the Willman 1 constraints onto the sterile-neutrino-mass-mixing-angle\nplane (equation 4) is shown in Figure 4a. As discussed above (Section 1.3; see also Section\n3 in LKB and Section 5 below) there are two kinds of limits, both of which are shown.\nThe first assumes only that the thermal history of the universe is given by standard Big\nBang cosmology. Sterile neutrinos are ruled out for the region in parameter space where\nthe flux from sterile neutrinos produced at minimal abundance via the DW mechanism\n(Asaka, Laine, & Shaposhnikov 2007) exceeds our derived limits. The second limit is that\nwhich overpredicts the derived limits if sterile neutrinos account for 100% of the dark matter\n(dark-matter fraction of sterile neutrinos fst = 1), regardless of how they are produced. In\nFigure 4b, the former limits, which are the most general, are compared with those we derived\nin Ursa Minor with Suzaku.\nThe smaller Chandra beam and more compact Willman 1 dark matter distribution compensate somewhat for the higher sensitivity of the Suzaku measurement to yield constraints\n\n\fnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\nresiduals\n\n0.01\n0\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.02\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nEnergy (keV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFig. 2.- Total (red), SB (green), and SB-subtracted (black) spectra. The histogram is the\nbest-fit GXB+CXB model to the PB-subtracted spectrum of Figure 1b. The SB results in\nan oversubtraction below 2 keV. Due to the contribution of the Milky Way halo the SB is\nexpected to contain the dark-matter signal as well; and, therefore subtraction of the SB can\nsimultaneously lower both the background and the signal. The oversubtraction below 2 keV\nand the weakening of the signal due to subtraction of the Milky Way contribution are the\ntwo reasons why we do not use the SB-subtracted spectrum for data analysis.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- \u2206\u03c72 = 9.2 line flux upper (solid histogram) and lower (broken histogram) limits\nin photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nat sterile neutrino masses < 14 keV (corresponding to photon energies in the spectra < 7\nkeV) of similar magnitude to those derived for Ursa Minor in LKB. This comparison utilizes\na projected mass enclosed within the relevant radius of 55 pc (5\u2032 at 38 kpc) Mpro = 2 \u00d7 106\nM\u2299 \u2013 corresponding to a mass surface density of \u03a3 = 210 M\u2299 pc\u22122 \u2013 as determined by\nprojecting the best-fit NFW (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997) mass model in Strigari et al.\n(2008b). The 90% confidence contours for the NFW parameters allow values of Mpro that\nare 4\u00d7 lower, and 2 \u2212 3\u00d7 higher. In addition, we estimate that the Milky Way dark matter\nhalo and the extragalactic dark matter contribute an additional 65 \u2212 125 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Xue at\nal. 2008, and references therein). While maintaining a fiducial mass of 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , we show\nthe effect on the general constraints of varying the surface density, and hence the effective\nmass in the FOV, by factor of two in either direction in Figure 4b.\n\n4.\n\nA Candidate Line at 2.5 keV\n\nIn addition to the limits derived above, we present evidence of a spectral feature consistent with a 2.5 keV line from decay of a 5 keV relic sterile neutrino.\n\n4.1.\n\nLine Flux and Statistical Significance\n\nThe largest residual excess emission to the PB-subtracted Willman 1 spectrum with\nrespect to the best-fit continuum model occurs at \u223c 2.5 keV. When we add an additional\nGaussian component, we find that \u03c72 improves by 5 (Figures 5 and 6). The line-width\nis consistent with an unresolved feature broadened only by the instrumental line spread\nfunction, as expected considering the small Willman 1 velocity dispersion. For power-lawplus-Gaussian fits to the 2.2-5 keV spectrum, the best-fits and uncertainties on the line\nenergy and flux are 2.51 \u00b1 0.07(0.11) keV and [3.53 \u00b1 1.95(2.77)] \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nwhere the errors are 68% (90%) confidence limits for two degrees of freedom corresponding\nto \u2206\u03c72 = 2.3 (4.61) (Section 3; Yaqoob 1998). The corresponding confidence contours are\nshown in Figure 7, as is the \u2206\u03c72 = 9.21 (99% confidence) contour. The 2.2 keV limit was\nchosen to avoid the energy associated of the peak of the brightest of the PB Au fluorescence\nlines, and with the deep Chandra mirror iridium edge (Chartas et al. 2000; there is also a\nshallow edge at \u223c 2.55 keV that does not impact our results). The issue of these instrumental\nfeatures is specifically addressed in Section 4.2.4. However, extending the range to the full\n1.1-7 keV high energy segment bandpass yields a consistent measurement (Fline = [2.85 \u00b1\n1.85(2.57)] \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) as do fits over other subsets of this bandpass. In the\n2.4-2.6 keV energy interval, the total, PB, and source counts are 696 \u00b1 26.4, 601 \u00b1 13.6, and\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- (a) top: The sterile neutrino parameter space to the right of the solid curve is\nexcluded by the Chandra observation of Willman 1 assuming only that DW production by\nneutrino oscillations takes place. The sterile neutrino parameter space to the right of the\nbroken curve is excluded if 100% of dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos produced\nby some (unspecified) mechanism. The mass of 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 is derived from the best-fit NFW\n(Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997) mass model in Strigari et al. (2008b). (b) bottom: The\nsolid curve from (a) is reproduced and compared to constraints assuming projected masses\nof 1 and 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 (broken curves; see text), and to the constraints derived from Suzaku\nobservation of Ursa Minor (dotted line).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n95 \u00b1 30, respectively. In the composite models the emission line component accounts for 90%\nof the flux. 20 counts in this interval are expected based on the best-fit power-law model\nwithout a line. Figure 8 shows the unfolded spectrum \u2013 the ratio of the data values to the\nproduct of the model multiplied by the response, all multiplied by the model values \u2013 over\nthe 1.5-5 keV spectral region.\nThe feature is not positively detected in the global blank sky spectrum (Abazajian et\nal. 2007, and references therein). The \u2206\u03c72 = 4.61 upper limit based on the reprojected\nestimated SB of Willman 1 is 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . When we utilize the SB,\nor appropriately-scaled S2, spectrum as background the fits are not significantly improved\nin models with an additional emission line, although the upper limits are consistent with\nthe line flux based on the PB-subtracted spectrum. As the SB (Figure 2) and S2 spectra\noverestimate the Willman 1 background, and will include a contribution due to the Milky\nWay dark matter halo (plus, possibly significant, additional emission from the outer Willman\n1 halo in the latter), the expectation that the PB-subtracted spectrum is most sensitive for\nthese purposes is confirmed.\nNotably, the flux is consistent with the narrow region in the mass-mixing-angle plane\nwhere the DW neutrino oscillation mechanism produces all of the dark matter (and where\nsterile neutrino emission from neutron stars may explain pulsar kicks \u2013 see next section).\nFigure 9 shows the predicted flux at each energy E\u03b3 assuming DW production of sterile neutrinos of mst = 2E\u03b3 , and fst = 1. We compare this with the \u2206\u03c72 = 4.61 upper limits derived\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations (see Section 3), and our measurement. Even accounting for\nuncertainties in the DW production rate, and allowing for a factor of four uncertainty in\nthe mass, a fluctuation at this level maps into this narrow region only over \u223c 1 \u2212 3.5 keV.\nAt lower energies the predicted line flux is below our sensitivity, while at higher energies\na much stronger feature would be expected. That is, the likelihood of a marginal feature\ncompatible with the simplest sterile neutrino hypothesis is much less than the likelihood at\nsome random X-ray energy.\n\n4.2.\n\nDiscussion\n\n4.2.1. Comparison with Limits from Classical Milky Way Dwarf Spheroidals\nWe re-examine the Suzaku spectra of the Ursa Minor and Draco \"classical\" Milky Way\ndwarf spheroidals to check for consistency with the line flux limits of the 2.5 keV candidate\nsterile neutrino radiative decay emission line in Willman 1.

Draco\nhas a similar projected mass to that of Ursa Minor (Strigari et al. 2007a).\nFactoring in these mass ratios, and their respective distances, the 90% limits of the\nWillman 1 line flux translates to a predicted flux of (3.2 \u00b1 2.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 in\nUrsa Minor. In re-analyzing these spectra, we focus on the 1.3-5.2 keV energy region and,\nas in LKB, fit the unsubtracted and unbinned spectrum to a model that includes power-law\nand Gaussian non-X-ray background (PB) components (see LKB for details on how the\nspectra are segmented, and other details). An additional line is not required based upon\nsimultaneous re-analysis of the Suzaku XIS1 (frontside-illuminated) and XIS03 (co-added\nbackside illuminated) spectra \u2013 in fits where the line flux is tied in the two spectra. However,\nfits to the XIS1 spectra, when analyzed independently, are improved by the addition of such\na line (\u2206C=7, where C is the Cash-statistic; Cash 1979). The best fit line energy is 2.41\nkeV with 90% confidence limits 2.35-2.57 keV (and a secondary local minimum at \u223c 2.5\nkeV); the line flux is (2.5 \u00b1 1.9) \u00d7 10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Figure 10a) \u2013 consistent with\nthe expectations. However, the line is not detected in the (less sensitive) XIS03 Ursa Minor\nspectrum: the upper limit is 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Figure 10b). The Suzaku spectra\nof Draco, reduced and analyzed in an identical manner, do not require a 2.5 keV line. The\nupper limit from simultaneous fits is \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , with similar limits\nfrom the individual detectors. Because of its larger distance, the expected flux from Draco\nis \u223c 25% smaller than for Ursa Minor.\nRiemer-Sorensen & Hansen (2009) analyzed archival data (ObsIDs 9589 and 9776) of\nthe Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We have re-analyzed these data, essentially replicating\ntheir reduction procedures, but deriving line flux upper limits from the spectrum extracted\nfrom a 4\u2032 circular aperture by application of the procedure used to derive limits for Willman 1 (Section 3). There are significant differences in the two datasets. The Willman 1\nobservation is about three times deeper; and was centered on the I-array instead of the S3\nchip. The latter has \u223c 30% higher effective area at 2.5 keV,4 but also a higher background.\nOther factors that contribute to a lower background in the Willman 1 observation are the\nlower point source detection threshold (about 5 times as many point sources are detected),\nthe higher concentration of Willman 1 that allows us to use a a smaller spectral extraction\nregion, and the ability to pre-filter the particle background (see section 2; the Draco observation was conducted in FAINT, rather than VFAINT, data-mode). We derive a 90% upper\nlimit at \u223c 2.5 keV of 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 in Draco, consistent with the results\nof Riemer-Sorensen & Hansen (2009).

Other Dark Matter Dominated Systems\nSome of the strongest claimed limits on sterile neutrino parameters are derived from\nM31 (Watson et al. 2006; Boyarsky et al. 2008, 2010). These depend on estimates of the\ndark matter content in regions where baryonic matter is significant, if not dominant. While\nthere is a fairly strong consensus on the total mass in M31, there is a wide range of possible\nmass decompositions (primarily) into stellar disk, stellar bulge, and dark matter halo components (Chemin, Carignan, & Foster 2009; Corbelli et al. 2009; Saglia et al. 2010) \u2013 wider\nthan assumed in the papers referred to above. The best-fits presented in Corbelli et al.\n(2009) are obtained using the Burkert (1995) dark matter density distribution function. The\nresulting projected dark matter mass of 2.9 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (for models with constrained virial\nmass) in the 1.1-3 kpc annulus, demonstrates that a non-detection in M31 does not stand in\ncontradiction to a feature in Willman 1 with best-fit parameters we derive from the Chandra\ndata (Kusenko and Loewenstein 2010).\nThe diluting effects of X-ray emission associated with stellar and/or hot plasma presents\na potential complication in systems with prominent baryonic components. For galaxies,\nwe estimate the contribution from an old stellar population of mass M\u2217 to the luminosity\nemitted in an energy interval \u2206E at 2.5 keV, using the power-law indices and normalizations\nin Revnivtsev et al. (2008), as\nL\u2206E (2.5keV)/M\u2217 = 1.0 \u00d7 1026 [1 + 40(1 \u2212 fres )]\n\n20\u2206E\n,\nE\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the ratio \u2206E/E is normalized to a typical CCD spectral resolution (at 2.5 keV) of 20.\nThe first term accounts for cataclysmic variable and coronally active binary stars, as seen in\nthe Milky Way and M31 (Li & Wang 2007; Bogdan & Gilfanov 2008). The second accounts\nfor low mass X-ray binaries, with fres the fraction of the LMXB flux that is resolved out\n(which depends on the angular resolution and exposure depth of the observation, as well\nas the LMXB luminosity function). The ratio of this term to the sterile neutrino radiative\ndecay line emission from the dark matter mass Mdark is\n[0.111 + 4.44(1 \u2212 fres )]\n\n20\u2206E \u22121 M\u2217\n.\n\u0393\u221227\nE\nMdark\n\n(6)\n\nThis emission, that may be augmented by discrete sources and hot gas associated with a\nmore recent star formation, may be non-negligible where dark matter is subdominant or\nmarginally dominant.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nIn galaxy clusters and groups, and massive elliptical galaxies, that are filled with hot\n(\u223c 1 \u2212 10 keV) plasma enriched with the products of star formation, emission of a 2.5 keV\nsterile neutrino decay line may be overwhelmed by K\u03b1 emission lines at \u223c 2.45 and \u223c 2.6\nkeV from He-like and H-like S, respectively. For example, in M87 the observed S XV line\nflux (Matsumoto et al. 1996) within 10\u2032 is \u223c 10\u00d7 that expected from the amount of dark\nmatter (Churazov et al. 2008) if it were composed of sterile neutrinos decaying at the rate\ninferred in Willman 1.\nOf course, the gravitational potential wells in dwarf spheroidals are far too shallow (their\nobserved velocity dispersions corresponding to \u223c 10 eV temperatures) to bind gas hot enough\nto collisionally ionize S to this degree, and there are no significant sources of photoionization.\nIf hot plasma were somehow responsible for the Willman 1 2.5 keV emission line, one would\nexpect much stronger accompanying emission in Si-K and Fe-L shell emission that is not\nseen \u2013 unless the elemental abundances are highly and uniquely peculiar. When we attempt\nto fit the Willman 1 spectrum with a thermal plasma model (best fit temperature, kT \u223c 2\nkeV), we find that the 2.5 keV line may be accounted for only if the S/Fe abundance ratio\nexceeds 50\u00d7 the solar ratio.\n\n4.2.3. Other Constraints\nThe limits based on Lyman-\u03b1 forest data (Boyarsky et al. 2009) allow up to 40% of dark\nmatter in the form of 5-keV sterile neutrinos produced via Dodelson-Widrow (DW) scenario\n(Dodelson & Widrow 1994). However, if there is any contribution from the Higgs boson\ndecays, the resulting population of relic sterile neutrinos has about three times smaller freestreaming length than the DW population (Kusenko 2006; Petraki 2008; Petraki & Kusenko\n2008; Boyanovsky 2008b). The inclusion of the additional \"cold\" population of sterile neutrinos weakens or eliminates the Ly-\u03b1 bounds. Although a detailed numerical analysis of\nsuch mixed dark matter has yet to be performed, the approximate analytical results indicate\nthat 5 keV sterile neutrinos can account for 100% of dark matter in this case (Petraki 2008;\nBoyanovsky 2008a,b).\n\n4.2.4. Instrumental Features in Proximity\nImproper subtraction of the PB could conceivably produce artefacts in the subtracted\nspectrum that may be misinterpreted as a feature. We address this issue, as follows, by applying an analysis procedure to the Willman 1 spectrum along the lines that we implemented\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nin analyzing the Suzaku dwarf spheroidal spectra (see Section 4.2.1, LKB). We consider the\nfull unsubtracted, and unbinned, spectrum in the 2.2-5 keV band. The reduced-background\nPB spectrum (Section 2.4) is fit by a model consisting of a power-law and two Gaussian emission lines with energies corresponding to the brightest Au fluorescent features (Chartas et al.\n2000), and line-widths that are free to vary. The addition of a line at 2.51 keV does not\nimprove the fit, and the \u2206C = 2.7 line flux upper limit is 6 \u00d7 10\u22127 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nIf we then fit the total (unsubtracted) spectrum with the same baseline model, the addition of a line at 2.51 keV improves the fit by \u2206C = 5.8 and the best-fit line flux of\n\u22126\n\u22122 \u22121\n3.5+2.1\ns (\u2206C = 2.7 errors) is consistent with the estimate based on\n\u22122.5 \u00d7 10 photons cm\nthe PB-subtracted spectrum. If we allow the line energy to float, we find energy 2.57 \u00b1 0.06\nkeV and flux 4.2 \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u2206C = 4.6 errors), again consistent with\nthe initial estimate. The improvement in fit over the baseline model is \u2206C = 10.6. If we\nthen go back and refit the PB spectrum with an additional line with energy fixed at 2.57\nkeV, we find that the \u2206C = 2.7 line flux upper limit is 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and\nthe inclusion of the line does not improve the fit (\u2206C = 1.6). These considerations indicate\nthat the 2.5 keV feature is not an artefact of inaccurate PB subtraction. The unbinned PB\nand total spectra and best fit models are shown in Figure 11ab; the same comparison with\nthe data rebinned (in the plot only) is shown along with the two best-fit models in Figure\n12. Confidence contours are plotted in Figure 13.\n\n4.2.5. Consistency, but not Corroboration\nOur re-examination of the other X-ray dwarf spheroidal datasets yields an intriguingly\nsimilar weak 2.5 keV feature in the Suzaku XIS1 spectrum of Ursa Minor, but fails to confirm\nthe presence of an emission line at the expected strength in Suzaku and Chandra data on\nDraco and the Suzaku XIS03 spectrum of Ursa Minor. Boyarsky et al. (2010) do not detect a\nfeature in either the Sculptor or Fornax dwarf spheroidals; although, it is notable that these\nsystems have relatively low mass-to-light ratios (Wolf et al. 2009) \u2013 increasing the possibility\nof the presence of the diluting effects of an unresolved stellar component (the former is known\nto have a population of X-ray binaries; Maccarone et al. 2005) \u2013 a factor that is also an\nissue in M31 (see above). Detection of a 2.5 keV line from sterile neutrinos is impeded in the\nmost massive dark-matter dominated systems, which are well known to retain hot metalenriched (interstellar, intragroup, or intracluster) gas with line-emission from highly ionized\nS. Such sources of confusion are absent in the extreme baryon-poor faint and ultra-faint\ndwarf spheroidals, making them the cleanest targets for confirming or refuting the evidence\nfor 5 keV sterile neutrino dark matter uncovered in Willman 1.\n\n\fnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\nresiduals\n\n0\n5\u00d710\u22123\n0\n\u22125\u00d710\u22123\n\nresiduals\n\nnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\nEnergy (keV)\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n0.01\n0\n\u22120.01\nEnergy (keV)\n\nFig. 11.- (a) top: Unbinned PB spectrum and best fit model (see text).

Our\nmeasurement lies near the limit of faint source line fluxes attainable with the best current\ndetectors and, even in the most promising targets, the possible presence of sterile neutrinos\nwith the most suitable parameters in terms of viability as a dark matter candidate lie tantalizingly close to the edge of detectability. It is notable that the Willman 1 X-ray observation\nis unique in that it represents the only deep Chandra exposure of a very high mass-to-light\nsystem, so that all sources of competing 2.5 keV line and continuum emission of astrophysical\norigin are minimized. On the other hand, the dynamical nature of Willman 1 remains unresolved and continues to be investigated (Gutowski et al. 2010; Willman 2010). Additional\nobservations of this \u2013 and/or other similar \u2013 dwarf spheroidals may be required to settle the\nquestion of whether the Willman 1 feature is real or spurious.\n\n5.\n\nImplications of a Detection\n\nOne can take two different approaches to interpreting the spectral line from a decaying relic particle. If one assumes dark matter is solely composed of sterile neutrinos, then\nthe number density of particles is determined by the particle mass and the mixing angle is\ninferred from the line flux. Alternatively, one can relax the assumption equating the relic\ndensity and total dark matter density (Hinshaw et al. 2009) \u2013 e.g., there may be additional\ncontributing dark matter components. Regardless of any additional physics, sterile neutrinos\nof a given mass and mixing angle are produced by neutrino oscillations (Dodelson & Widrow\n1994) at a rate that is calculable and cannot be reduced by any unknown high-scale physics.5\nThe contours for the allowed ranges of mass and mixing angle are somewhat different depending on whether the relic sterile neutrino density is assumed to be equal to the measured\ncosmological density of dark matter (Kusenko 2006). We show the results of both approaches\nin Figure 14.\nInterpreted as a sterile neutrino radiative decay, the emission line energy and 90% flux\nlimits imply mst = 5 \u00b1 0.2 keV, \u0393\u03bds \u2192\u03b3\u03bda = (1.4 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u221227 (fst M7 /0.2)\u22121 , and sin2 \u03b8 =\n(7.8\u00b16.1)\u00d710\u221210(fst M7 /0.2)\u22121, where the projected mass in the Chandra beam is normalized\nto the fiducial value of 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 . sin2 \u03b8 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 (M7 /0.2)\u22121 represents an absolute\nlower limit to the mixing angle, regardless of the sterile neutrino production mechanism. If\n5\n\nThe only caveat to this argument is the possibility of a non-standard cosmology with a low reheat\ntemperature, as pointed out by Gelmini et al.

This range is consistent with the region corresponding to production by non-resonant\noscillations alone that is circumscribed by the solid lines marked \"dark matter (min)\" and\n\"dark matter (max)\". If the primordial abundance of sterile neutrinos is not assumed, the\nallowed range for the mass and the mixing angle is shown by dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed\ncontours corresponding to maximum, average, and minimum efficiency production by neutrino oscillations. A projected mass within 55 pc of 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 is assumed (Strigari et al.\n2008b). The inferred parameters are consistent with the pulsar kick mechanisms based on\neither resonant (MSW) or non-resonant production in the cooling neutron star (see text,\nKusenko 2009).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nthere was some DW production, at least 9.5(M7 /0.2)\u22121 % of the dark matter must have been\nproduced in this manner (based on the minimum production and lower line flux limit). If\nthe DW mechanism is responsible for all of the sterile neutrino production, sin2 \u03b8 = (2.5 \u2212\n15.7) \u00d7 10\u221210 (M7 /0.2)\u22121/2 , where the lower (upper) limit corresponds to the line flux lower\n(upper) limit and the maximum (minimum) production; and, fst > 0.31(M7 /0.2)\u22121/2 . The\ndata is consistent with DW production and fst = 1 (Figure 9) for M7 = 0.019 \u2212 0.77, where\nthe lower (upper) limit is derived from the minimum (maximum) flux and production. The\ncorresponding mixing angle for minimum (maximum) production is sin2 \u03b8 = 17.7(3.6)\u00d710\u221210 .\nIn fact our best fit flux matches that expected for average DW production and fst = 1 for\nM7 = 0.18 (sin2 \u03b8 = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u221210 ), which is close to our fiducial mass (Figure 9).\nThe allowed region may be further circumscribed if combined with previously derived\nconstraints. Limits have been derived using a variety of datasets (mostly based on Chandra\nor XMM-Newton data), employing a variety of data reduction, background mitigation, and\nstatistical techniques to derive upper limits, taking diverse approaches (if any) to account for\nemission associated with baryons (see above), and depend on different methods for estimates\n(and associated uncertainties) of the dark matter content in the field-of-view. The limits\nbased on Chandra deep field measurements of the unresolved X-ray background originating\nin the Milky way dark matter halo (Abazajian et al. 2007) are perhaps the most directly\ncomparable in that deep Chandra ACIS-I data (some of which was taken in VFAINT mode)\nwas utilized. These constraints are consistent with dark matter being composed of mst = 5\nkeV sterile neutrinos produced by the DW mechanism. XMM-Newton observations of diffuse\nemission in the M31 halo are formally inconsistent with our best-fit flux under the same\nassumptions. However, taking the uncertainties into account, an ample region of concordance\nis retained that includes parameters where fst = 1 and non-resonant oscillations are the\ndominant, or sole, mechanism of sterile neutrino production (Section 4.2).\nThis interpretation has immediate implications for particle physics and astrophysics. In\nparticular, supernova physics is altered dramatically by the emission of a 5 keV sterile neutrino that has a mixing angle sin \u03b8 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 . First, the emission is anisotropic, with the\ndirection of anisotropy set by the electron spins polarized in the magnetic field (Kusenko & Segr\u00e8\n1997; Fuller et al. 2003). While the overall energy removed by sterile neutrinos with 5 keV\nmass and sin \u03b8 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 is small, the anisotropy in the emission of sterile neutrinos\nplays a central role in generating the supernova asymmetries. Second, the lepton number,\nenergy, and entropy transport in the cooling neutron star are affected, and an increase in the\nelectron neutrino luminosity can preheat the material in front of the shock wave, adding to\nthe energy of the overall explosion (Hidaka & Fuller 2007). Third, the neutrino-driven kick\nenhances the convection in front of the neutron star, which causes some energy increase of\nthe shock wave (Fryer & Kusenko 2006). The numerical simulations of this effect show the\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nformation of asymmetric jets with the stronger jet pointing in the direction of the pulsar\nmotion (Fryer & Kusenko 2006).\nFrom the point of view of particle physics, the 5 keV sterile neutrino with a small mixing\nangle can be accommodated in a seesaw mass matrix that satisfies all the experimental and\nobservational constraints (Kusenko 2009). The values inferred from the Chandra observations allow for all dark matter to be produced via neutrino oscillations, so that no additional\nproduction mechanism is necessary. This, however, does not preclude the 5 keV mass from\nbeing generated via the Higgs mechanism by a vacuum expectation value of an electroweakscale singlet Higgs boson, which may be discoverable by upcoming experiments at the Large\nHadron Collider (Kusenko 2006; Petraki & Kusenko 2008).\nThe X-rays emitted by dark matter decay during the \"dark ages\" could produce a strong\nenough ionization to enhance the formation of molecular hydrogen, which, in turn, could\nspeed up the formation of the first stars (Biermann & Kusenko 2006). The corresponding\npredictions for 21 cm and other observations depend on the knowledge of the particle mass\nand mixing angle (Stasielak et al. 2007) that are greatly refined if the dark matter particle\nhas the mass and mixing inferred from Chandra observations of Willman 1.\nFinally, there is no doubt that observational cosmology will take advantage of our finding\nif it is confirmed. If dark matter emits a narrow spectral line in X-rays, one can hope to map\nout the three-dimensional dark matter distribution, including the redshift, using future Xray telescopes such as Astro-H 6 and IXO.7 Such data could be used to study the expansion\nof the universe on cosmological distance scales.\n\n6.\n\nSummary and Concluding Remarks\n\nWe presented results of a search for a radiatively decaying dark matter emission line\nin the Chandra spectrum of the ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy Willman 1. \u2206\u03c72 = 9.2\nupper limits on the line flux over the 0.4-7 keV bandpass were translated to an allowed region\nin the sterile neutrino mass-mixing angle plane for the case where all of the dark matter is\ncomposed of sterile neutrinos regardless of how they are produced, and in the more general\ncase where their abundance is not assumed but is calculated under the assumptions that\nminimize it. These constraints are consistent with and therefore, given the uncertainties in\nmass determination, reinforce those derived from previous X-ray analysis of dwarf spheroidal\n6\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/astroh/, http://astro-h.isas.jaxa.jp/\n\n7\n\nhttp://ixo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\ngalaxies (LKB, Riemer-Sorensen & Hansen 2009).\nWe uncovered evidence of an emission line in the Willman 1 X-ray spectrum with energy\n2.51 \u00b1 0.07(0.11) keV and flux [3.53 \u00b1 1.95(2.77)] \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , where the errors\nare 68% (90%) confidence limits. This was based on an excess to the continuum measured by\nfitting the particle-background-subtracted source spectrum, where the VFAINT data-mode\nquiescent background reduction technique was applied. Consistent parameters were found\nusing maximum likelihood fitting to the unbinned, unsubtracted spectrum. Re-examination\nof Suzaku data of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal, and Chandra data on the Draco dwarf\nspheroidal, reveal a possible confirmation in the Suzaku XIS1 spectrum of Ursa Minor, but\nnot in any of the other spectra. Evidence of dark matter radiative decay in Willman 1\nremains provisional due to the low level of significance, but uncontradicted. In the short\nterm, additional X-ray observations of SDSS dwarf spheroidals are needed, while future high\nenergy resolution X-ray spectroscopy should prove definitive.\nWe derive the range of allowed sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle implied by the\n90% confidence limits of line energy and flux, assuming that either (1) dark matter solely\nconsists of sterile neutrinos regardless of how they are produced, or that (2) they are solely\nproduced by neutrino oscillations regardless of whether the abundance matches that of dark\nmatter as inferred from cosmology. Remarkably, the two allowed regions strongly overlap\n\u2013 that is, the observations are consistent with the narrow region in the mass-mixing-angle\nplane where neutrino oscillations may produce all of the dark matter (although it allows\nfor some non-DW production). Moreover, the inferred parameters are consistent with the\npulsar kick mechanisms based on either resonant or non-resonant sterile neutrino production\nin cooling neutron stars. This unlikely concordance intensifies the importance and urgency\nof additional investigation.\nThe authors thank James Bullock and Manoj Kaplinghat for discussions of mass profiles, target selection, and other key issues related to this work.
