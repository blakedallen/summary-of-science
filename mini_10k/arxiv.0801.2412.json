Introduction\nPatterns in permutations have been studied sporadically, often implicitly, for over\na century, but in the last two decades this area has grown explosively, with several\nhundred published papers. As seems to be the case with most things in enumerative\ncombinatorics, some instances of permutation patterns can be found already in\nMacMahon's classical book from 1915, Combinatory Analysis [48]. In the seminal\npaper Restricted permutations of Simion and Schmidt [56] from 1985 the systematic\nstudy of permutation patterns was launched, and it now seems clear that this field\nwill continue growing for a long time to come, due to its plethora of problems that\nrange from the easy to the seemingly impossible, with a rich middle ground of\nchallenging but solvable problems. Most important, perhaps, for the future growth\nof the subject, is the wealth of connections to other branches of combinatorics,\nother fields of mathematics, and to other disciplines such as computer science and\nphysics.\nWhereas an occurrence of a classical pattern p in a permutation \u03c0 is simply a\nsubsequence of \u03c0 whose letters are in the same relative order (of size) as those in p,\nin an occurrence of a generalized pattern, some letters of that subsequence may\nbe required to be adjacent in the permutation. For example, the classical pattern\n1 2 3 4 simply corresponds to an increasing subsequence of length four, whereas an\noccurrence of the generalized pattern 1 23 4 would require the middle two letters\nof that sequence to be adjacent in \u03c0, due to the absence of a dash between 2 and\n3. Thus, the permutation 23145 contains 1 2 3 4 but not 1 23 4. Note that for\nthe classical patterns, our notation differs from the usual one, since the dashes we\nhave between every pair of adjacent letters in a classical pattern are usually omitted\nwhen only classical patterns are being considered.\nIt is well known that the number of permutations of length n avoiding any one\nclassical pattern of length 3 is the n-th Catalan number, which counts a myriad different combinatorial objects. There are many other results in this direction, relating\npattern avoiding permutations to various other combinatorial structures, either via\nbijections, or by such classes of permutations being equinumerous to the structures\nThe work presented here was supported by grant no. 060005012/3 from the Icelandic Research\nFund.\n\n\f2\n\nE. STEINGR\u00cdMSSON\n\nin question without there being a known bijection. Counting permutations according to the number of occurrences of generalized patterns one comes up with a vast\narray of known sequences, such as the Euler numbers, Stirling numbers of both\nkinds, Motzkin numbers, Entringer numbers, Schr\u00f6der numbers, Fibonacci numbers, Pell numbers and many more. Also, one often finds lesser known sequences\nthat are nevertheless related to known structures, such as directed animals, planar\nmaps, permutation tableaux, various kinds of trees and involutions in Sn , to name a\nfew. Thus, generalized patterns provide a significant addition to the already sizable\nflora of classical patterns and their connections to other combinatorial structures.\nIn fact, due to their great diversity, the non-classical generalized patterns are\nlikely to provide richer connections to other combinatorial structures than the classical ones do. Supporting this is the fact that the recently proved Stanley-Wilf\nconjecture-which gives a strong bound for the growth rate of the number of permutations of length n avoiding a classical pattern-does not hold for some generalized\npatterns.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce definitions and in\nSection 3 we mention implicit appearances of generalized patterns in the literature.\nIn Sections 4 and 5 we survey what is known about the avoidance of generalized\npatterns of length three and four, respectively. In Section 6 we give some examples\nwhere generalized patterns have shown up in very different contexts, establishing\nconnections to various other combinatorial structures, some of which seem quite\ndeep. Section 7 lists several instances of so-called barred patterns that turn out\nto be equivalent to generalized patterns and Section 8 deals with asymptotics for\navoidance of generalized patterns. Finally, in Section 9, we mention some further\ngeneralizations of the generalized patterns.\n2. Some definitions\nIf a permutation \u03c0 = a1 a2 . . . an contains the pattern 1 23 then clearly the reverse of \u03c0, that is an an\u22121 . . . a1 , contains the reverse of 1 23, which is the pattern\n32 1. Since taking the reverse of a permutation is a bijection on the set of permutations of length n, the number of permutations avoiding a pattern p equals the number of permutations avoiding the reverse of p. More generally, the distribution-on\nthe set of permutations of length n-of the number of occurrences of a pattern\np equals the distribution for the reverse of p. The same is true of the bijection\nsending a permutation \u03c0 = a1 a2 . . . an to its complement \u03c0 c = b1 b2 . . . bn , where\nbi = n + 1 \u2212 ai . (When we take the complement of a pattern we leave the dashes in\nplace, so the complement of 1 342 is 4 213.) These two transformations, together\nwith their compositions, generate a group of order 4 on the set of patterns, and we\nsay that two patterns belong to the same symmetry class if one is transformed into\nthe other by an element of this group. As an example, the patterns 2 31, 2 13, 13 2\nand 31 2 form an entire symmetry class.1\nClearly, two patterns in the same symmetry class have the same properties with\nrespect to the number of permutations avoiding them, and more generally when it\ncomes to the number of permutations with k occurrences of a pattern, for any k.\nHowever, it does happen that two patterns not belonging to the same symmetry\nclass have the same avoidance. Thus, two patterns are said to belong to the same\nWilf class if they have the same avoidance, that is, if the number of permutations\nof length n that avoid one is the same as that number for the other. Clearly, a Wilf\nclass is a union of symmetry classes (if we define both as equivalence classes).\n1In the case of classical patterns, taking the inverse of a pattern is well defined and preserves\n\navoidance, so patterns that are each other's inverses belong to the same symmetry class. This is\nnot the case for generalized patterns.\n\n\fGENERALIZED PERMUTATION PATTERNS - A SHORT SURVEY\n\n3\n\nFor example, although the classical patterns of length 3 belong to two symmetry\nclasses (represented by 1 2 3 and 1 3 2, respectively), they all belong to the same\nWilf class, since their avoidance is given by the Catalan numbers. For classical\npatterns, much is known about Wilf classes for patterns of length up to 7, but a\ngeneral solution seems distant. For the generalized patterns, much less is known.\nThe best reference to date is probably [18]. As an example, the patterns 1 23 and\n1 32 belong to the same Wilf class (the avoidance counted by the Bell numbers in\nboth cases) but not the same symmetry class.\n3. Generalized patterns in the literature\nGeneralized patterns have shown up implicitly in the literature in various places,\nand subsets of these have been studied in some generality. Namely, Simion and\nStanton [57] essentially studied the patterns 2 31, 2 13, 31 2, and 13 2 and their\nrelation to a set of orthogonal polynomials generalizing the Laguerre polynomials, and one of these patterns also played a crucial role in the proof by Foata and\nZeilberger [31] that Denert's statistic is Mahonian. A permutation statistic is Mahonian if it has the same distribution-on the set of permutations of length n for\neach n-as the number of inversions.\nGoulden and Jackson give an exponential generating function (EGF) for the\nnumber of permutations avoiding the pattern 123 (no dashes), in the book Combinatorial Enumeration [36, Exercise 5.2.17a, p. 310]. The formula is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\u22121\nX x3n\nX x3n+1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u2212\n(1)\n(3n)!\n(3n + 1)!\nn\u22650\n\nn\u22650\n\nAlthough this does not seem to be mentioned in [36], the obvious generalization\nholds. Namely, the EGF for the number of permutations avoiding the dashless\npattern 12 * * * k is obtained by replacing 3 by k in (1). It is pointed out in [45,\nSection 3] that this general result can be obtained through an inclusion/exclusion\nargument similar to one given in [45].\nThe dashless patterns of length 3 also appeared earlier, implicitly, as the valleys\n(213 and 312), the peaks (132 and 231), the double ascents 123 and the double\ndescents 321 in a permutation, the study of which was pioneered by Fran\u00e7on and\nViennot [33], and which is intimately related to Flajolet's [29] generation of Motzkin\npaths by means of certain continued fractions. This will be mentioned later, in\nSection 6, in connection with related, recent developments.\nAlso, the alternating permutations, which have been studied for a long time\n[2, 3], are permutations that avoid the patterns 123 and 321, (with the additional\nrestriction that the first two letters of the permutation be in decreasing order;\notherwise they are reverse alternating. In fact, this extra restriction is equivalent\nto the avoidance of the pattern [12) as defined in [4]).\nGeneralized patterns were first defined explicitly, in full generality, in the paper\nGeneralized permutation patterns and a classification of the Mahonian statistics [4],\nwhere it was shown that almost all Mahonian permutation statistics in the literature at that time (up to a certain bijective correspondence translating \"excedance\nbased\" statistics to \"descent based\" statistics; see [4, 20]) could be written as linear combinations of generalized patterns. All but one of these statistics could be\nexpressed as combinations of patterns of length at most 3. The odd one out was\na statistic defined by Haglund [37], which, after translation by the bijection mentioned above, could be expressed as a combination of patterns of length 4 or less\n(see [4]). Although all the possible Mahonian statistics based on generalized patterns of length at most 3 were listed in [4], proofs were not given that all of them\n\n\f4\n\nE. STEINGR\u00cdMSSON\n\nwere indeed Mahonian. These proofs were later supplied by Foata and Zeilberger\n[32], who solved some of the conjectures with bijections, but others using the \"Umbral Transfer Matrix Method\" of Zeilberger [63]. The remaining conjectures in [4],\nconcerning a slight generalization of generalized patterns, were proved bijectively\nby Foata and Randrianarivony [30].\n4. Avoidance (and occurrences) of generalized patterns of length 3\nThe study of avoidance of generalized patterns-along the lines of the work of\nSimion and Schmidt [56] for the classical patterns-was initiated by Claesson in\nthe paper Generalized pattern avoidance [16], where the enumeration was done for\navoidance of any single pattern of length 3 with exactly one dash. These patterns\nfall into three equivalence classes with respect to avoidance. One of these classes,\nconsisting of the patterns 2 31, 2 13, 31 2 and 13 2, has the same avoidance as both\nof the classes of classical patterns of length 3, and thus has avoidance enumerated\nby the Catalan numbers. In fact, avoiding 2 31 is equivalent to avoiding 2 3 1, as\nshown in [16], and likewise for the other three patterns. This is obviously true also\nfor the patterns 21 and 2 1, since the only permutation with no descent and no\ninversion is the increasing permutation 123 . . . n. It is shown by Hardarson [38] that\nthis can not occur for patterns of length greater than three, that is, two different\npatterns of length more than three cannot be avoided by the same permutations.\nThe other two classes of one-dash patterns of length three, consisting of the patterns\n1 23 and 1 32 and their respective sets of equivalent patterns, are enumerated by\nthe Bell numbers, counting partitions of sets. This was proved bijectively in each\ncase in [16].\nThe fact that the Bell numbers count permutations avoiding 1 23 (and some\nother generalized patterns) has interesting implications. Namely, this shows that\nthe Stanley-Wilf conjecture (proved by Marcus and Tardos [49] in 2004) does not\nhold for some generalized patterns. This ex-conjecture says that for any classical\npattern p the number of permutations of length n avoiding p is bounded by C n for\nsome constant C. This is easily seen to fail for the Bell numbers, whose exponential\nx\ngenerating function is e(e \u22121) . Apart from this, nothing seems to be known about\ngrowth rates of the number of permutations avoiding generalized patterns.\nThat the Bell numbers count the avoidance of 1 23 also implies the falseness for\ngeneralized patterns of another conjecture, by Noonan and Zeilberger [52] (but first\nmentioned by Gessel [34]), that the number of permutations avoiding a classical\npattern is polynomially recursive, that is, satisfies a recursion\nP0 (n)f (n) = P1 (n)f (n \u2212 1) + P2 (n)f (n \u2212 2) + * * * + Pk (n)f (n \u2212 k)\nwhere k is a constant and each Pi is a polynomial. This conjecture, however, is\nlargely believed to be false even for classical patterns, although a counterexample\nis still missing.\nClaesson [16] also enumerated the avoidance of three classes of pairs of generalized patterns of length 3 with one dash each. These turned out to be equinumerous\nwith non-overlapping set partitions (counted by the Bessel numbers), involutions\nand Motzkin paths, respectively. Enumerative equivalences among the class of patterns corresponding to non-overlapping partitions, together with the connection to\nset partitions, naturally led to the definition of monotone partitions in [16].\nIn [18], Claesson and Mansour then completed the enumeration of permutations\navoiding any pair of generalized patterns with one dash each. They also conjectured\nenumerative results for avoidance of any set of three or more such patterns. These\nconjectures were proved for sets of size three by Bernini, Ferrari and Pinzani [5],\n\n\fGENERALIZED PERMUTATION PATTERNS - A SHORT SURVEY\n\n5\n\nand by Bernini and Pergola [7] for the sizes 4, 5 and 6, the remaining sizes being\nrather trivial.\nElizalde and Noy [28] treated the dashless patterns (which they call \"consecutive\npatterns\"), that is, patterns with no dashes, and gave generating functions enumerating permutations according to the number k of occurrences of a pattern. This is\na much stronger result than enumerating permutations avoiding a pattern, which\nis just the special case k = 0. In particular, they enumerated the avoidance of both\nWilf classes of dashless patterns of length 3, and gave differential equations satisfied by the generating functions for three of the seven Wilf classes of patterns of\nlength 4 (see the next section). As mentioned before, their result in the special case\nof avoidance of the pattern 123, was obtained already in the book Combinatorial\nEnumeration by Goulden and Jackson [36, Exercise 5.2.17a].\nFor subsets of two or more dashless patterns of length 3, Kitaev [41] and Kitaev\nand Mansour [46, 47] gave direct formulas for almost every case, and recursive\nformulas for the few remaining ones. Examples of the formulas thus obtained are\nCk \u0001+ Ck+1 where Ck is the k-th Catalan number, the central binomial coefficients\n2n\nn , and the Entringer numbers, which also count certain permutations starting\nwith a decreasing sequence and then alternating between ascents and descents.\nThus, the avoidance of any set of generalized patterns of length 3 has been\nunderstood, in most cases in the sense of explicit formulas or generating functions,\nor at least in terms of recursively defined functions.\nIn [17], Claesson and Mansour found the number of permutations with exactly\none, two and three occurrences, respectively, of the pattern 2 31. They used the\nconnection between continued fractions and Motzkin paths (see Section 6) that had\nbeen used in [20] to give a continued fraction for a generating function counting\noccurrences of 2 31, among other things. Later, Parviainen [54] showed how to\nuse bicolored Motzkin paths to give a continued fraction counting permutations of\nlength n according to the number of occurrences of 2 31. He gave an algorithm\nfor finding an explicit formula, and gave this explicit formula\n(always a rational\n\u0001\n2n\nfunction in n times a binomial coefficient of the form n\u2212a\n) for each n \u2264 8. Finally,\nCorteel and Nadeau [22] found a bijective proof of the fact, first proved in [17],\nthat \u0001the number of permutations of length n with exactly one occurrence of 2 31 is\n2n\nn\u22123 . They exploited the connection between generalized patterns and permutation\ntableaux. For more about that connection, see Section 6.\n5. Patterns of length 4\nThe classical patterns of length 4 fall into three Wilf classes, represented by the\npatterns 1 2 3 4, 1 3 4 2 and 1 3 2 4. The avoidance of the first two has been\nsolved (the first by Gessel [34], the second by B\u00f3na [8]), but 1 3 2 4 still remains\nto be understood, although some noteworthy progress was recently made by Albert\net al. in [1].\nFor generalized patterns of length 4 (other than the classical ones), the situation\nis much more complicated than for those of length 3, as is to be expected. There\nare 48 symmetry classes, and computer experiments show that there are at least 24\nWilf classes, but their exact number does not seem to have been determined yet.\nAs mentioned above, for the dashless patterns of length 4, Elizalde and Noy [28]\ngave differential equations satisfied by the generating functions for the number\nof occurrences of three out of seven Wilf classes, namely the classes containing\n1234, 1243 and 1342, respectively. The remaining classes are represented by 2413,\n2143, 1324 and 1423. Note that a Wilf class is a class of patterns with the same\navoidance, whereas Elizalde and Noy proved that in each Wilf class of dashless\npatterns of length four, all patterns have the same distribution. That is, the number\n\n\f6\n\nE. STEINGR\u00cdMSSON\n\nof permutations of length n with k occurrences of a pattern is the same for two\npatterns in the same Wilf class in this case, but not in general.\nKitaev [45, Theorem 13] found an expression for the exponential generating\nfunction (EGF) for the avoidance of \u03c3 k, where \u03c3 is any dashless pattern and\nk is larger than all the letters in \u03c3, in terms of the EGFs for avoidance of the\npattern \u03c3. In particular, if \u03c3 is any dashless pattern of length 3, this, together\nwith the results of Elizalde and Noy [28], yields explicit formulas for the EGFs for\nthe avoidance of \u03c3 4, where \u03c3 is any dashless pattern of length 3 (although one of\nRx\n2\nthese formulas involves the integral 0 e\u2212t dt). Since there are precisely two Wilf\nclasses for dashless patterns of length 3, this gives the avoidance of two Wilf classes\nof patterns of length 4.\nAlso, Callan [14] has given two recursive formulas for the number of permutations\navoiding 31 4 2.\nThese seem to be all the enumerative results so far for patterns of length 4.\nFor the non-classical patterns we thus have formulas for the avoidance of six Wilf\nclasses out of (at least) 24, whereas for the classical patterns of length 4 there are\nformulas for two out of three classes. However, there is no reason to assume that\nthe non-classical patterns should be harder to deal with than the classical ones, so\nexplicit results for the avoidance of more such patterns should not be considered\nout of reach.\n6. Generalized patterns appearing in other contexts\nIn Section 1 we mentioned the connection between dashless patterns as valleys,\npeaks, etc., in permutations, and Flajolet's [29] generation of Motzkin paths by\nmeans of continued fractions. Using results from Flajolet's paper [29], Clarke, Steingr\u0131\u0301msson and Zeng [20, Corollary 11] found a continued fraction capturing, among\nother things, the distribution of permutations according to the number of occurrences of 2 31. This was made explicit in [17, Corollary 23]. A polynomial formula\nfor the joint distribution of descents and 2 31 was conjectured by Steingr\u0131\u0301msson and\nWilliams (unpublished), after Williams [61, Corollary 5.3] had shown that formula\nto count permutations according to weak excedances and alignments which Williams\nwas studying in connection with so called permutation tableaux (for definitions see\n[58, 61]). This conjecture (part of a much larger conjecture later proved in [58]) was\nfirst proved by Corteel [21]. The formula is as follows (see Corollary 30 in [58]):\nThe number of permutations of length n with k \u2212 1 descents and m occurrences\nof the pattern 2 31 is equal to the coefficient of q m in\nq \u2212k\n\n2\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)i [k \u2212 i]n q ki\n\ni=0\n\n\u0012\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\nn k\u2212i\nn\nq\n+\n.\ni\ni\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nHere, [k \u2212 i] is the q-bracket defined by [m] = (1 + q + * * * + q m\u22121 ). This is the only\nknown polynomial formula for the entire distribution of a pattern of length greater\nthan 2. The two cases of length 2 correspond to the Eulerian numbers, counting\ndescents, and the coefficients of the q-factorial\n[n]! = (1 + q)(1 + q + q 2 ) * * * (1 + q + q 2 + * * * + q n\u22121 ),\nwhich count permutations according to the number of inversions. A descent is an\noccurrence of the pattern 21 and an inversion is an occurrence of 2 1.\nMoreover, this connection between patterns and permutation tableaux also led\nto the discovery, by Corteel [21] (see also [23, 24]), of a connection between the\npermutation tableaux and the partially asymmetric exclusion process (PASEP), an\n\n\fGENERALIZED PERMUTATION PATTERNS - A SHORT SURVEY\n\n7\n\nimportant model in statistical mechanics. In particular, the distribution of permutations of length n according to number of descents and number of occurrences of\nthe pattern 2 31 equals a probability distribution studied for the PASEP.\nIn [19], a bijection is given between the permutations of length n avoiding both\n2 41 3 and 3 1 4 2 on one hand, and so called \u03b2(1, 0)-trees on the other. The\n\u03b2(1, 0)-trees are rooted plane trees with certain labels on their vertices. These trees\nwere defined by Jacquard and Schaeffer [40], who described a bijection from rooted\nnonseparable planar maps to a set of labeled plane trees including the \u03b2(1, 0)-trees.\nThese trees represent, in a rather transparent way, the recursive structure found\nby Brown and Tutte [10] on planar maps. As it turns out, the bijection given in\n[19] simultaneously translates seven different statistics on the permutations to corresponding statistics on the \u03b2(1, 0)-trees. In fact, the permutations avoiding 2 41 3\nand 3 1 4 2 seem to be more closely related structurally to the \u03b2(1, 0)-trees-and\nthus to the planar maps involved-than the two-stack sortable permutations that\nhad previously been shown to be in bijection with the planar maps in question (see\nSection 7). Earlier, Dulucq, Gire and West [25] constructed a generating tree for the\npermutations avoiding 2 4 1 3 and 3 14 2 that they showed to be isomorphic to a\ngenerating tree for rooted nonseparable planar maps. (Clearly, permutations avoiding these two patterns are equinumerous with the permutations avoiding 3 1 4 2\nand 2 41 3, treated in [19].) However, instead of the pattern 3 14 2 they used a\nso-called barred pattern, which we treat in Section 7, and they only showed their\nbijection, which is different from the one in [19], to preserve two different statistics,\nrather than the seven statistics in [19].\n\n7. Generalized patterns in disguise\nAs mentioned above, generalized patterns have occurred implicitly in several\nplaces in the literature, even before the systematic study of classical permutation\npatterns. However, they have also appeared as so-called barred patterns, which\nsometimes, but not always, turn out to be equivalent (in terms of avoidance) to some\ngeneralized patterns. An example of a barred pattern is 4 2\u0304 1 3. A permutation\n\u03c0 is said to avoid this pattern if it avoids the pattern 3 1 2 (corresponding to the\nunbarred elements 4 1 3) except where that pattern is part of the pattern 4 2 1 3.\nGire [35] showed that the Baxter permutations, originally defined in a very different way [15], are those avoiding the two barred patterns 4 1 3\u0304 5 2 and 2 5 3\u0304 1 4.\nIt is easy to show that avoiding 4 1 3\u0304 5 2 is equivalent to avoiding 3 14 2 and\navoiding 2 5 3\u0304 1 4 is equivalent to avoiding 2 41 3. Thus, the Baxter permutations are precisely those that avoid both 3 14 2 and 2 41 3. In fact, this was\npointed out in Erik Ouchterlony's thesis [53, p. 5].\nThe barred pattern 4 1 3\u0304 5 2 also shows up in [25], where Dulucq, Gire and West\ntreated so called nonseparable permutations (bijectively related to rooted nonseparable planar maps), which they characterized by the avoidance of 2 4 1 3 and\n4 1 3\u0304 5 2, the latter one being equivalent to 3 14 2 as mentioned in the previous\nsection.\nAlso, in [9], Bousquet-M\u00e9lou and Butler deal with the pattern 2 1 3\u0304 5 4, avoiding which is easily shown to be equivalent to avoiding 2 14 3. Permutations avoiding that pattern and 1 3 2 4 are called forest-like permutations in [9]. It is also\nmentioned there that avoiding 2 1 3\u0304 5 4 (and thus 2 14 3) is equivalent to avoiding 2 1 4 3 with Bruhat condition (1 \u2194 4) in the terminology of Woo and Yong,\nwho conjectured [62] that a Schubert variety is locally factorial if and only if its\nassociated permutation avoids these two patterns. That conjecture was proved in\n[9].\n\n\f8\n\nE. STEINGR\u00cdMSSON\n\nNot all barred patterns can be expressed in terms of generalized patterns, however. For example, West [59] showed that two-stack sortable permutations are\ncharacterized by the simultaneous avoidance of 2 3 4 1 and the barred pattern\n2 5\u0304 3 4 1, and it is easy to show that no generalized pattern is avoided by the\nsame permutations as those avoiding 2 5\u0304 3 4 1. It is also easy to show that there\nis no pair of generalized patterns of length 4 that is avoided by the same permutations as those that avoid 2 3 4 1 and 2 5\u0304 3 4 1. A consequence of this is that\ntwo-stack sortability of a permutation cannot be characterized by the avoidance of\na set of generalized patterns. This is because there are precisely two permutations\nof length four that are not two-stack sortable, namely 2341 and 3241, so such a\nset would have to contain two generalized patterns whose underlying permutations\n(obtained by disregarding the dashes in the patterns) were 2341 and 3241. It is\neasy to check, by computer, that no such pair will do the job.\nAlso Callan [13] has shown that the number of permutations avoiding 31 4 2\nis the same as the number avoiding the barred pattern 3 5\u0304 2 4 1, although these\nare not the same permutations. (As mentioned above, Callan [14] has given two\nrecursive formulas for this number.)\nAn obvious open problem here is to determine when avoiding a barred pattern\nis equivalent to avoiding a generalized pattern.\n\n8. Asymptotics\nAs mentioned before, the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, proved by Marcus and Tardos\n[49], says that the number of permutations of length n avoiding any given classical\npattern p is bounded by C n for some constant C depending only on p.\nIn [27], Elizalde studies asymptotics for the number of permutations avoiding\nsome generalized patterns and concludes that, in contrast to the classical patterns,\nthere probably is \"a big range of possible asymptotic behaviors.\" Although much\nwork remains to be done here, and although it is not clear how varied this behavior\ncan be, the extremes are already known. Namely, whereas the number of permutations of length n avoiding a classical pattern is bounded by cn for a constant c,\nElizalde [27, Theorem 4.1] shows that the number \u03b1n (\u03c3) of permutations of length\nn avoiding a dashless (or consecutive) pattern \u03c3 of length at least three satisfies\ncn n! < \u03b1n (\u03c3) < dn n!\nfor some constants c and d (where, clearly, 0 < c, d < 1).\nAn interesting open question related to this is which generalized patterns, apart\nfrom the classical ones, satisfy the Stanley-Wilf conjecture. It has been pointed out\nby Hardarson [39] that a pattern containing a block with at least two letters a and b,\nwith a < b, and a letter x in some other block, with x < a or b < x, can not satisfy\nthe Stanley-Wilf conjecture, because there will be at least as many permutations\navoiding it as there are permutations that avoid 1 23, and the number of such\npermutations is known not to satisfy the Stanley-Wilf conjecture (these are the\nBell numbers). Thus, essentially the only open cases left are the patterns 2 3 41,\n3 2 41, 3 41 2 and 2 41 3, which all have the same avoidance for n \u2264 10. If these\npatterns turn out not to satisfy the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, that would prove the\ntempting conjecture that a generalized pattern satisfies the Stanley-Wilf conjecture\nif and only if it is avoided by the same permutations as the classical pattern with\nthe same underlying permutation. As mentioned in Section 4, it has been shown\nby Hardarson [38] that this happens only for patterns of length 3 or less.\n\n\fGENERALIZED PERMUTATION PATTERNS - A SHORT SURVEY\n\n9\n\n9. Further generalizations\nKitaev, in [45], introduced a further generalization of generalized patterns (GPs),\nnamely the partially ordered generalized patterns or POGPs. These are GPs where\nsome letters may be incomparable in size. An example of such a pattern is 3 12 3,\nan occurrence of which consists of four letters, the middle two adjacent (and in\nincreasing order) and the first and the last both greater than the middle two, with\nno condition on the relative sizes of the first and the last letter. Avoiding the pattern\n3 12 3 is equivalent to avoiding both 3 12 4 and 4 12 3. Indeed, an occurrence\nof 3 12 3 is equivalent to an occurerence of either 3 12 4 or 4 12 3. In general, a\nPOGP is equal, as a function counting occurrences, to a sum of GPs.\nIn [38], Hardarson finds EGFs for the avoidance of k \u03c3 k, where \u03c3 is any dashless\npartially ordered pattern and k is larger than any letter in \u03c3, in terms of the EGF\nfor the avoidance of \u03c3. In the special case where \u03c3 = 12 he gives a bijection between\npermutations avoiding 3 12 3 and bicolored set partitions, that is, all partitions of\na set where each block in the partition has one of two possible colors. Also, for\n\u03c3 = 121, he gives a bijection between permutations of length n+ 1 avoiding 3 121 3\nand the Dowling lattice on {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nOne interesting, and curious, result arising from Kitaev's study of POGPs in [45]\nis that knowing the EGF for the avoidance of a dashless pattern p is enough to find\nthe EGF for the entire distribution of the maximum number of non-overlapping\noccurrences of p. Two occurrences of p in a permutation \u03c0 are non-overlapping\nif they have no letter of \u03c0 in common. For example, the permutation 4321 has\nthree descents (occurrences of 21), but only two non-overlapping descents. Namely,\nKitaev [45] proves the following theorem:\nTheorem (Kitaev [45], Theorem 32). Let p be a dashless pattern. Let A(x) be the\nEGF for the number of permutations that avoid p and let N (\u03c0) be the maximum\nnumber of non-overlapping occurrences of p in \u03c0. Then\nX\n\u03c0\n\ny N (\u03c0)\n\nA(x)\nx|\u03c0|\n=\n,\n|\u03c0|!\n1 \u2212 y((x \u2212 1)A(x) + 1)\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of lengths 0, 1, 2, . . . .\nAlternative proofs, and some extensions, of Theorem 9 were given by Mendes [50]\nand by Mendes and Remmel [51], using the theory of symmetric functions.\nA generalization in a different direction is the study of generalized patterns on\nwords, that is, on permutations of multisets. Research in this area has only recently\ntaken off, even in the case of classical patterns. For the generalized patterns, see\n[6, 12, 42].\nFinally, Burstein and Lankham have considered barred generalized patterns, in\nrelation to patience sorting problems (see [11], which also has further references).\nReferences\n[1] M.H.
