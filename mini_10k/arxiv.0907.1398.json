Cayley\ngraphs of G \u2240 H can be obtained in an intuitive way by starting with a Cayley\ngraph of G and associating with each of its vertices a lamp whose possible\nstates are indexed by the elements of H, see below. Graphs obtained this way\nare called lamplighter graphs. A well-known special case are the Diestel-Leader\n[4] graphs DL(n, n).\nKaimanovich and Vershik [8, Sections 6.1, 6.2] proved that lamplighter\ngraphs of infinite grids Zd , d \u2265 3 admit non-constant, bounded, harmonic functions. Their construction had an intuitive probabilistic interpretation related to\nrandom walks on these graphs, which triggered a lot of further research on lamplighter graphs. For example, spectral properties of such groups are studied in\n[2, 7, 10] and other properties related to random walks are studied in [5, 6, 14].\nHarmonic functions on lamplighter graphs and the related Poisson boundary\nare further studied e.g. in [1, 9, 15]. Finally, Lyons, Pemantle and Peres [11]\nproved that the lamplighter graph of Z over Z2 has the surprising property that\nrandom walk with a drift towards a fixed vertex can move outwards faster than\nsimple random walk.\nIt is known that the existence of a non-constant harmonic function of finite Dirichlet energy implies the existence of a non-constant bounded harmonic\nfunction [16, Theorem 3.73]. Given the aforementioned impact that bounded\nharmonic functions on lamplighter graphs have had, it suggests itself to ask\nwhether these graphs have non-constant harmonic functions of finite Dirichlet\nenergy. For lamplighter graphs on a grid it is known that no such harmonic functions can exist, since the corresponding groups are amenable and thus admit\nno non-constant harmonic functions of finite Dirichlet energy [13]. A. Karlsson\n\u2217 Supported\n\nby FWF grant P-19115-N18.\n\n1\n\n\f(oral communication) asked whether this is also the case for graphs of the form\nT \u2240 Z2 where T is any regular tree. In this paper we give an affirmative answer\nto this question. In fact, the actual result is much more general:\nTheorem 1.1. Let G be a connected locally finite graph and let H be a connected\nfinite graph with at least one edge. Then G \u2240 H does not admit any non-constant\nharmonic function of finite Dirichlet energy.\nIndeed, we do not need to assume that any of the involved graphs is a Cayley\ngraph. Lamplighter graphs on general graphs can be defined as in the usual case\nwhen all graphs are Cayley graphs; see the next section.\nAs an intermediate step, we prove a result (Lemma 3.1 below) that strengthens a theorem of Markvorsen, McGuinness and Thomassen [12] and might be\napplicable in order to prove that other classes of graphs do not admit nonconstant Dirichlet-finite harmonic functions.\n\n2\n\nDefinitions\n\nWe will be using the terminology of Diestel [3]. For a finite path P we let |P |\ndenote the number of edges in P . For a graph G and a set U \u2286 V (G) we let\nG[U ] denote the subgraph of G induced by the vertices in U . If G is finite then\nits diameter diam(G) is the maximum distance, in the usual graph metric, of\ntwo vertices of G.\nLet G, H be connected graphs, and suppose that every vertex of G has a\ndistinct lamp associated with it, the set of possible states of each lamp being\nthe set of vertices V (H) of H. At the beginning all lamps have the same state\ns0 \u2208 V (H), and a \"lamplighter \" is standing at some vertex of G. In each unit\nof time the lamplighter is allowed to choose one of two possible moves: either\nwalk to a vertex of G adjacent to the vertex x \u2208 V (G) he is currently at, or\nswitch the current state s \u2208 V (H) of x into one of the states s\u2032 \u2208 V (H) adjacent\nwith s. The lamplighter graph G \u2240 H is, then, a graph whose vertices correspond\nto the possible configurations of this game and whose edges correspond to the\npossible moves of the lamplighter. More formally, the vertex set of G \u2240 H is the\nset of pairs (C, x) where C : V (G) \u2192 V (H) is an assignment of states such that\nC(v) 6= s0 holds for only finitely many vertices v \u2208 V (G), and x is a vertex of\nG (the current position of the lamplighter). Two vertices (C, x) and (C \u2032 , x\u2032 ) of\nG \u2240 H are joined by an edge if (precisely) one of the following conditions holds:\n\u2022 C = C \u2032 and xx\u2032 \u2208 E(G), or\n\u2022 x = x\u2032 , all vertices except x are mapped to the same state by C and C \u2032 ,\nand C(x)C \u2032 (x) \u2208 E(H).\nThis definition of G \u2240 H coincides with that of Erschler [6].\nThe blow-up of a vertex v \u2208 V (G) in L = G \u2240 H is the set of vertices of L of\nthe form (C, v). Similarly, the blow-up of a subgraph T of G is the subgraph of\nL spanned by the blow-ups of the vertices of T . Given a vertex x \u2208 V (L) we\nlet [x] denote the vertex of G the blow-up of which contains x.\nAn edge of L is a switching edge if it corresponds to a move of the lamplighter\nthat switches a lamp; more formally, if it is of the form (C, v)(C \u2032 , v). For a\nswitching edge e \u2208 E(L) we let [e] denote the corresponding edge of H. A ray\n2\n\n\fis a 1-way infinite path; a 2-way infinite path is called a double ray. A tail of a\nray R is an infinite (co-final) subpath of R.\nA function\nP \u03c6 : V (G) \u2192 R is harmonic, if for every x \u2208 V (G) there holds\n1\n\u03c6(x) = d(x)\nxy\u2208E(G) \u03c6(y), where d(x) is the number of edges incident with x.\nGiven such a function \u03c6, and an edge e = uv, we let w\u03c6 (e) := (\u03c6(u) \u2212 \u03c6(v))2\ndenote the\nPenergy dissipated by e. The (Dirichlet) energy of \u03c6 is defined by\nW (\u03c6) := e\u2208E(G) w\u03c6 (e).\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1\n\nWe start with a lemma that might be applicable in order to prove that other\nclasses of graphs do not admit non-constant Dirichlet-finite harmonic functions.\nThis strengthens a result of [12, Theorem 7.1].\nLemma 3.1. Let G be a connected locally finite graph such that for every two\ndisjoint rays S, Q in G there is a constant c and a sequence (Pi )i\u2208N of pairwise\nedge-disjoint S\u2013Q paths such that |Pi | \u2264 ci. Then G does not admit a nonconstant harmonic function of finite energy.\nProof. Let G be a locally finite graph that admits a non-constant harmonic\nfunction \u03c6 of finite energy; it suffices to find two rays S, Q in G that do not\nsatisfy the condition in the assertion.\nSince \u03c6 is non-constant, we can find an edge x0 x1 satisfying \u03c6(x1 ) > \u03c6(x0 ).\nBy the definition of a harmonic function, it is easy to see that x0 x1 must lie\nin a double ray D = . . . x\u22121 x0 x1 . . . such that \u03c6(xi ) \u2265 \u03c6(xi\u22121 ) for every i \u2208 Z;\nindeed, every vertex x \u2208 V (G) must have a neighbour y such that \u03c6(y) \u2265 \u03c6(x).\nDefine the sub-rays S = x0 x1 x2 . . . and Q = x0 x\u22121 x\u22122 . . . of D. Now\nsuppose there is a sequence (Pi )i\u2208N of pairwise edge-disjoint S\u2013Q paths such\nthat |Pi | \u2264 ci for some constant c.\nNote that by the choice of D there is a bound u > 0 such that ui :=\n|\u03c6(si )\u2212\u03c6(qi )| \u2265 u for every i, where si \u2208 V (S) and qi \u2208 V (Q) are the endvertices\nof Pi .\nFor every edge e = xy let f (e) := |\u03c6(y) \u2212 \u03c6(x)|. Let Xi be the set of edges\nu\n, and let Yi be the set of all other edges in Pi . As\ne in Pi such that f (e) \u2265 0.9 ci\n|P\n|\n\u2264\nci\nby\nassumption,\nthe\nedges in Yi contribute less than 0.9u to ui , thus\nPi\nu\nf\n(e)\n>\n0.1u\nmust\nhold.\nBut since f (e) \u2265 0.9 ci\nfor every e \u2208 Xj , we have\ne\u2208Xj\nP\nu2\n(e) > 0.1 \u00d7 0.9 ci . As the sets Xj are pairwise edge-disjoint, and as\ne\u2208Xj w\u03c6P\nP\nthe series i 1/i is not convergent, this contradicts the fact that e\u2208E(G) w\u03c6 (e)\nis finite.\nWe now apply Lemma 3.1 to prove our main result.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. We will show that L := G \u2240 H satisfies the condition\nof Lemma 3.1, from which then the assertion follows. So let S, Q be any two\ndisjoint rays of L.\nSince L is connected we can find a double ray D in L that contains a tail\nS \u2032 of S and a tail Q\u2032 of Q. Let s0 (respectively, q0 ) be the first vertex of S \u2032\n(resp. Q\u2032 ). Let V0 be the set of vertices of G the blow-up of which meets the\npath s0 Dq0 . Note that V0 induces a connected subgraph of G, because the\n\n3\n\n\flamplighter only moves along the edges of G. Thus we can choose a spanning\ntree T0 of G[V0 ].\nFor i = 1, 2, . . . we construct an S \u2032 \u2013Q\u2032 path Pi as follows. Let si be the first\nvertex of S \u2032 not in the blow-up of Vi\u22121 , and let qi be the first vertex of Q\u2032 not in\nthe blow-up of Vi\u22121 . Let Vi := Vi\u22121 \u222a {si , qi }, and extend Ti\u22121 into a spanning\ntree Ti of G[Vi ] by adding two edges incident with si and qi respectively; such\nedges do exist: their blow-up contains the edges of S \u2032 , Q\u2032 leading into si , qi\nrespectively.\nWe now construct an si \u2013qi path Pi . Pick a switching edge e = si s\u2032i incident\nwith si . Then let Xi be the unique path in L from s\u2032i to a vertex qi+ with\n[qi+ ] = [qi ] such that Xi is contained in the blow-up of Ti . Pick a switching edge\nf = qi+ qi\u2212 incident with qi+ . Then follow the unique path Yi in L from qi\u2212 to a\n+\nvertex s+\ni with [si ] = [si ] such that Yi is contained in the blow-up of Ti . Let\n+ \u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne = si si be the switching edge incident with s+\ni such that [e ] = [e]. Finally,\n\u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032\nlet Zi be a path from si to the unique vertex qi with [qi qi ] = [f ], such that the\ninterior of Zi is contained in the blow-up of Vi\u22121 and Zi has minimum length\nunder all paths with these properties. Such a path exists because every lamp at\n\u2032\na vertex in G \u2212 Vi\u22121 has the same state in s\u2212\ni and qi ; indeed, the lamps in G \u2212 Vi\nwere never switched in the above construction, the lamp at [si ] was switched\ntwice on the way from si to s\u2212\ni using the same switching edge [e], which means\nthat its state in both endpoints of Zi coincides with that in si and qi , and finally\nthe lamp at [qi\u2032 ] has the same state in both endpoints of Zi , namely the state\n\u2212\n\u2032\n[f ] leads to. Now set Pi := si s\u2032i Xi qi+ qi\u2212 Yi s+\ni si Zi qi qi .\nIt is not hard to check that the paths Pi are pairwise disjoint. Indeed, let\ni < j \u2208 N. Then, by the choice of the vertices sj , qj and the construction of Pj ,\nit follows that for every inner vertex x of Pj , the configuration of x differs from\nthe configuration of any vertex in Pi in at least one of the two lamps at [sj ] and\n[qj ].\nIt remains to show that there is a constant c such that |Pi | \u2264 ci for every\ni. To prove this, note that |Pi | = |Xi | + |Yi | + |Zi | + 4; we will show that the\nlatter three subpaths grow at most linearly with i, which then implies that this\nis also true for Pi .\nFirstly, note that diam(Ti ) \u2212 diam(Ti\u22121 ) \u2264 2 since V (Ti ) := V (Ti\u22121 ) \u222a\n{si , qi }. By the choice of Xi we have |Xi | \u2264 diam(Ti ), from which follows that\nthere is a constant c1 such that |Xi | \u2264 c1 i. By the same argument, we have\n|Yi | \u2264 c1 i.\nIt remains to bound the length of Zi . For this, note that if T is a finite tree\nand v, w \u2208 V (T ), then there is a v-w walk W in T containing all edges of T and\nsatisfying |W | \u2264 3|E(T )|; indeed, starting at v, one can first walk around the\n\"perimeter\" of T traversing every edge precisely once in each direction (2|E(T )|\nedges), and then move \"straight\" from v to w (at most |E(T )| edges). Thus, in\norder to choose Zi , we could put a lamplighter at the vertex and configuration\n\u2212\nindicated by s\u2212\ni , and let him move in Ti \u2282 G along such a walk W from [si ]\n\u2032\nto [qi ], and every time he visits a new vertex x let him change the state of\nx to the state indicated by qi\u2032 . This bounds the length of Zi from above by\n3|E(Ti )|diam(H), and since |E(Ti )| \u2212 |E(Ti\u22121 )| = 2 and H is fixed, we can find\na constant c2 such that |Zi | \u2264 c2 i for every i. This completes the proof that\n|Pi | grows at most linearly with i.\nThus we can now apply Lemma 3.1 to prove that G \u2240 H does not admit a\nnon-constant harmonic function of finite energy.\n4\n\n\fProblem 3.1. Does the assertion of Theorem 1.1 still hold if H is an infinite\nlocally finite graph?\nLemma 3.1 might be applicable in order to prove that other classes of graphs\ndo also not admit non-constant Dirichlet-finite harmonic functions. For example, it yields an easy proof of the (well-known) fact that infinite grids have this\nproperty.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Brofferio and W. Woess.
