These next-generation\ndetectors are characterized by a prospective fiducial mass of 0.4 Mton or higher, which will\nallow studies of neutrinos of astrophysical or terrestrial origin with unprecedented statistics\nand sensitivity [8].\nIn particular, a new window would be opened on supernova neutrino physics: by naively\nrescaling the detector mass, it turns out that a 0.4 Mton experiment would observe a\nSN1987A-like signal with a statistics \u223c 200 times higher than in Kamiokande (2.14 kton)\n[3], and could promote the current SK upper limit on supernova relic neutrinos [9] into\na positive detection. In general, the observation of a large number of supernova neutrino\nevents will allow statistically significant spectral analyses in the energy, angular, and time\ndomain. In this context, the identification of relatively model-independent spectral features\nis important to disentangle, as far as possible, information related to supernova physics and\nneutrino emission from those related to neutrino flavor transitions. Recent spectral studies\nwhich refer to prospective Mton-class water-Cherenkov detectors include: analyses in the\nenergy domain to probe neutrino mass-mixing parameters [10], to perform multiparameter\nfits including neutrino emission parameters [11, 12], and to identify Earth matter effects [13];\nanalyses in the time domain to identify the neutronization burst [14, 15] or signatures of\nshock-wave propagation effects [10, 16]; analyses in the angular domain to achieve supernova\npointing [17]; background reduction projects using gadolinium [18, 19].1\nIn this work, we aim at studying some time dependent and independent observables\nrelated to (extra)galactic core collapse supernovae, assuming a prospective 0.4 Mton fiducial\nmass water-Cherenkov detector. In particular, we investigate the effects of the supernova\nshock propagation on the observable neutrino signal. We analyze the imprint of the shock\nwave on the time spectra of inverse beta decay events, and show that the ratio between\nthe number of events in two suitably chosen energy ranges can actually monitor the time\ndependence of the neutrino crossing probability PH , thus opening a unique opportunity to\nstudy shock-induced flavor transitions in \"real time\". Moreover, we also study the shockwave imprint on the time spectra of events coming from scattering of neutrinos on oxygen\nand on electrons. We point out that the shock wave produces a characteristic distorsion\nof the oxygen event spectra in time domain. The elastic scattering spectrum is instead\nrather insensitive to the shock-wave propagation and might be thus used to track the overall\ndecrease of neutrino luminosity.\nWe also study other observables that are basically insensitive to shock-wave effects. In\nparticular, we discuss the sensitivity of a 0.4 Mton detector in detecting total event rates for\nvarious interaction processes, supernova relic neutrinos and neutrinos from silicon burning\nbefore core collapse.\n1\n\nWe mention that large liquid argon detectors (not considered in this work) can also provide important\ninformation on supernova neutrinos; see. e.g., the recent works [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\n\n2\n\n\fThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we present the ingredients of our\ncalculations. We discuss our choice for several input (supernova simulations, neutrino oscillation parameters, effective detection cross sections) needed to compute the SN \u03bd signal.\nIn Sec. III we discuss the results of our calculations for observables which are not sensitive\nto shock waves, i.e., the total number of events in the pre-supernova phase and after supernova explosion, and the energy spectra of the diffuse SN relic neutrino background with and\nwithout gadolinium loading. In Sec. IV we investigate in detail the shock-wave signature on\nthe neutrino time spectra, and present a possible strategy to monitor the time evolution of\nthe neutrino crossing probability along the shock wave profile, by means of an appropriate\nratio of low-to-high energy events. Conclusions and prospects are given in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nOVERVIEW OF CALCULATIONS\n\nIn this Section we describe the main aspects and ingredients of our calculations of supernova neutrino event rates. We remind that, in general, numerical simulations of supernova\nexplosions provide the unoscillated double differential neutrino distribution in energy and\ntime,\nd2 N\u03bd\nF\u03bd0 =\n,\n(1)\ndE dt\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bde , \u03bd e and \u03bdx in standard notation [25, 26] (x indicating any non-electron flavor).\nSuch initial distributions are in general modified by flavor transitions (see, e.g., [10, 26]),\nF\u03bd0 \u2212\u2192F\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nand must be convoluted with the differential interaction cross section \u03c3e for electron or\npositron production, as well as with the detector resolution function Re , and the efficiency\n\u03b5, in order to finally get observable event rates [10],\nNe = F\u03bd \u2297 \u03c3e \u2297 Re \u2297 \u03b5 .\nA.\n\n(3)\n\nNeutrino spectra in energy and time\n\nTo our knowledge, only the Lawrence Livermore (LL) group has published in detail [27]\na successful simulation of supernova explosion and neutrino emission for a time interval long\nenough (\u223c 14 s) to cover the phenomenon of shock propagation [16, 28, 29]. Since we are\nparticularly interested to shock-wave signatures on neutrino flavor transitions, we assume\nthe LL simulation (which refers to a supernova progenitor mass of \u223c 20 solar masses) as our\nreference input for t > 0 (time after bounce).\nFor t < 0, Odrzywolek, Misiaszek and Kutschera (OMK) [30] have recently estimated\nthat the silicon burning phase preceding supernova explosion can release an energy of about\n(\u2212)\n5.4 \u00d7 1050 erg in neutrino-antineutrino pairs (with \u03bde : \u03bdx \u2243 5 : 1) for about a couple of\ndays, assuming a 20-solar mass progenitor (see, however, [31] for different time estimates).\nIn the absence of more detailed information, we assume a uniform neutrino flux from silicon\nburning for two days before t = 0, with emission parameters taken from [30].\nIn both cases (t > 0 and t < 0) we factorize the differential distribution of Eq. (1) as:\nF\u03bd0 =\n\ndN\u03bd\n\u03c6(E\u03bd ) ,\ndt\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fFIG. 1: Reference neutrino emission parameters as a function of time for different flavors: \u03bde , \u03bd e , and \u03bdx ,\nassuming a progenitor mass of \u223c 20 solar masses. Left panels: neutrino emission rate dN\u03bd /dt and average\nenergy hEi for the silicon burning phase, as taken from the OMK calculations [30]. Right panels: neutrino\nemission rate and average energy for the supernova neutrino burst, as taken from the Lawrence Livermore\n(LL) group simulation [27].\n\nfor any flavor (\u03bd = \u03bde , \u03bd e and \u03bdx ), where dN\u03bd /dt representsR the neutrino emission rate\n(number of \u03bd per unit time), while \u03c6(E, t) is the normalized ( dE \u03c6 = 1) energy spectrum\nparametrized as in [32]\n(\u03b1 + 1)\u03b1+1\n\u03c6(E) =\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 1)\n\nE\nhEi\n\n!\u03b1\n\ne\u2212(\u03b1+1)E/hEi\n,\nhEi\n\n(5)\n\nwhere hEi is the average neutrino energy and \u03b1 is an energy shape parameter. In general,\nboth \u03b1 and hEi can be function of time. For simplicity, we have taken \u03b1 = 3 for all flavors\nfor t > 0 [17], and \u03b1 \u2243 4.3 (from a fit to the spectrum in [30]) for t < 0. For t > 0, the\naverage energies for each flavor are given as a function of time in the LL simulation [27],\nwhile for t < 0 they are assumed nearly constant and equal to \u223c 1.8 MeV for all flavors in\nthe OMK evaluation [30].\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: Normalized neutrino spectra averaged over time. Left panel: energy spectra in the silicon burning\nphase, as derived from [30] with shape parameter \u03b1 = 4.28 [32]. Right panel: energy spectra associated to\nthe supernova neutrino burst, averaged in the time interval for shock-wave effects (t > 2), as derived from\n[27] with shape parameter \u03b1 = 3 [32].\n\nFigure 1 shows the main characteristics of our reference supernova emission model. The\nupper and lower panels show the neutrino emission rate dN\u03bd /dt and the average neutrino\nenergy hEi for different flavors. The left panels refer to the silicon burning phase from the\nOMK calculations [30], while the right panels refer to the supernova neutrino burst from\nthe LL group simulation [27]. According to the LL simulation, all flavors have comparable\n> 0.5 s). In the\nemission rates (within a factor \u223c 2) in the so-called cooling phase (t \u223c\npreceding phase the relative \u03bde emission rate is higher, and shows a distinct neutronization\npeak at 0.04\u20130.05 s. For later purposes, we observe that the LL simulations predict limited\nvariations (< 20%) of the average neutrino energy in the time range (t > 2 s) relevant for\nshock-wave effects on neutrino flavor transitions.\nFigure 2 shows the normalized neutrino spectra \u03c6 for each flavor, after a flux-weighted\naverage over time, for both the silicon burning phase (left panel) and after supernova explosion (right panel). For later purposes, in the right panel we have restricted the integration\ninterval to t > 2 s, i.e., to the interval where shock-wave effects are relevant for flavor transitions. Note that, in the silicon burning phase, the spectra are equal for all flavors, and are\npeaked at relatively low energy (< 2 MeV) [30]. During the supernova explosion, neutrinos\nhave an order of magnitude higher average energy, and are peaked at different energy for\neach flavor [27]. Of course, the detailed features of the reference emission model in Figs. 1\nand 2 must be taken with a grain of salt, since the distribution of the total energy in flavor\nand time is currently subject to large uncertainties, which may be reduced in more advanced\nfuture simulations [33].\n5\n\n\fB.\n\nNeutrino crossing probability and shock waves\n\nAssuming standard three-neutrino mixing, the parameters relevant to flavor transitions in\nsupernovae are the two independent squared mass difference \u03b4m2 and \u2206m2 and the mixing\nangles \u03b812 and \u03b813 (see, e.g., [34]). For \u03b4m2 \u2243 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , as currently indicated by reactor\nand solar neutrino data [35], the dependence on \u03b4m2 actually vanishes, while the dependence\non \u2206m2 and on \u03b813 can be essentially embedded in the so-called crossing probability PH (up\nto Earth matter effects that, for simplicity, we do not consider in this work). In general, PH\ntakes the same form for both neutrinos and antineutrinos [34],\nPH = PH (\u2206m2 /E, sin2 \u03b813 , V (x, t)) ,\nwhere V is the neutrino potential profile [36] at radius x and time t,\n\u221a\nV (x, t) = 2 GF Ne (x, t) ,\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nand Ne is the electron density. When needed, we fix \u2206m2 \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 from atmospheric and accelerator data [37], sin2 \u03b812 \u2243 0.3 from reactor and solar data [35], and take\nrepresentative value of sin2 \u03b813 below current upper bounds [38].\nMatter effects are potentially relevant when the potential equals the neutrino wavenumber\nkH = \u2206m2 /2E,\n(8)\nV (x, t) \u2243 kH .\n\nIndeed, it has been shown in [39] that, even for non-monotonic supernova density profiles,\nthe evaluation of PH in Eq. (6) can be obtained with good approximation through a simple\nprocedure involving the ordered product of matrices embedding the local crossing probabilities [40], evaluated at all points where Eq. (8) is fulfilled. This approximation is particularly\nuseful to study the effect of non trivial density profiles, such as those induced by shock\nwaves.\nIn a seminal paper [28], Schirato and Fuller noted that the propagation of the forward\nshock wave in the LL simulation [29] could influence neutrino flavor transitions a few seconds\nafter core bounce. In addition to forward shock effects, it has been recently pointed out [16]\nthat a second (\"reverse\") shock front, is also expected to propagate behind the forward\none (at a lower velocity), although a detailed description is not yet possible within current\nnumerical experiments.\nFigure 3 shows the simplified shock-wave profiles used in this work. The upper panel\nrefers to the neutrino potential V in the presence of forward shock only [28], using the\nsame parametrization as in [39]. The main features of the forward shock profile are a sharp\ndiscontinuity at the shock front (which can induce a strongly nonadiabatic transition) leaving\nbehind an extended rarefaction zone. In the lower panel we have graphically adapted the\nresults of the simulation in [16] to account for a reverse shock, characterized by a smaller\ndiscontinuity at the front. In both panels, we also show the band spanned by the neutrino\nwavenumber kH = \u2206m2 /2E for E \u2208 [2, 60] MeV. The condition for large matter effects\n(V \u2243 kH ) implies then that at relatively early (late) times only the static profile (the\nrarefaction zone) is relevant, while for intermediate times (e.g., t =2, 4 or 8 s in Fig. 3) the\npropagation of the shock front(s) must be accounted for.2\n2\n\nNeutrinos from silicon burning may also experience flavor transitions along the static profile (not considered in [30]). In fact, for a typical energy E \u2243 2 MeV (see Fig. 2, left panel), the condition V (x) \u2243 kH is\nfulfilled at x \u2243 104 km for the static profile, i.e., below the estimated silicon core radius (xSi \u223c 4\u00d7103 km).\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 3: Radial profile of the neutrino potential V (x) at different times t (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 s). Upper panel:\nOur simplified profile for the case of forward shock [28] (see also [39]). Lower panel: Our simplified profile\nfor the case of forward plus reverse shock, adapted from [16]. In both cases, the static profile (t \u2264 0 s) is\nalso shown. The band within dashed lines marks the region where matter effects are potentially important\n(V \u2243 kH for E = 2\u201360 MeV).\n\nFigure 4 shows our calculation of PH as a function of time for four representative values\nof sin2 \u03b813 , and for a relatively high neutrino energy (E = 45 MeV, useful for later purposes).\nThe left panels refers to the case with forward shock only, where the strong variations induced\nby the passage of the front discontinuity and then by the rarefaction zone are marked by\nvertical dotted lines. We refer the reader to [39] for a thorough discussion of forward-shock\neffects on PH . The right panels refer to the case with forward plus reverse shock, where\nthe effects of the reverse shock appear to change dramatically the crossing probability at\nintermediate times. Qualitatively, the nonadiabatic transition at the reverse shock front can\npartially \"undo\" the effect of the analogous transition at the forward shock front; this is\nparticularly evident, e.g., in the two upper panels. We refer the reader to [16] for further\ndiscussions about the time dependence of PH in the presence of a reverse shock. Despite\nits complexity, such time dependence might be monitored surprisingly well in future waterCherenkov detectors, as we shall see in Sec. IV.\n\n7\n\n\fFIG. 4: Crossing probability PH as a function of time, at relatively high neutrino energy (E = 45 MeV).\nLeft panels: case with forward shock only. Right panels: case with forward plus reverse shock. From\ntop to bottom, the mixing parameter sin2 \u03b813 takes the values 10\u22122 , 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 , and 10\u22125 . The function\nPH (t) changes rapidly at the times indicated by dotted vertical lines, i.e., when the static profile is first\nperturbed by the forward shock front (followed by the reverse shock front in the right panels) and then\nby the rarefaction zone. Notice how the reverse shock partially \"undoes\" the PH variation induced by the\nforward shock.\n\nC.\n\nNeutrino spectra and \"critical energy\"\n\nThe neutrino fluxes at the supernova exit (F\u03bd ) are linear combinations of the initial fluxes\n(F\u03bd0 ), with coefficients governed by PH and by the mixing angle \u03b812 , as well as by the mass\nspectrum hierarchy (normal or inverted). In particular, for normal mass hierarchy it is (see,\ne.g., [26])\nF\u03bd e \u2243 cos2 \u03b812 F\u03bd0e + sin2 \u03b812 F\u03bd0x ,\n2\n\n\u03b812 PH F\u03bd0e\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\u03b812 PH )F\u03bd0x\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nF\u03bd e \u2243 cos2 \u03b812 PH F\u03bd0e + (1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b812 PH )F\u03bd0x ,\n\n(11)\n\nF\u03bde \u2243 sin\n\n+ (1 \u2212 sin\n\nwhile, for inverted hierarchy,\n\nF\u03bde \u2243 sin\n\n2\n\n\u03b812 F\u03bd0e\n\n+ cos\n8\n\n2\n\n\u03b812 F\u03bd0x\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\n\fNotice that, for \u03bd e , the case of inverted hierarchy with PH = 1 is indistinguishable from\nthe case of normal hierarchy; similarly, for \u03bde , the case of normal hierarchy with PH = 1 is\nindistinguishable from the case of inverted hierarchy.\nFor later purposes, it is useful to introduce the concept of \"critical energy\" Ec [10], defined\nas the energy where the initial \u03bd e and \u03bdx fluxes are approximately equal,\nF\u03bd0e (Ec ) \u2243 F\u03bd0x (Ec ) .\n\n(13)\n\nAt the critical energy, flavor transitions are not effective in the antineutrino channel, and\nthe \u03bd e flux at supernova exit equals the initial one,\nF\u03bd e (Ec ) \u2243 F\u03bd0e (Ec )\n\n(14)\n\nfor both normal and inverted hierarchy.\nIn the LL simulation [27], the critical energy is relatively well defined and stable for\nt > 2 s (the range relevant for shock-wave effects); in this time interval, the \u03bd e and \u03bdx\nemission rates are comparable, and their average energies do not vary too much in time (see\nFig. 1). Within the LL simulation, the critical energy is then approximately defined by the\ncrossing point of the time-averaged \u03bd e and \u03bdx spectra in Fig. 2, i.e., Ec \u223c 20 MeV. This\nenergy provides a sort of \"no oscillation benchmark\", in comparison with higher energies\n(say, E \u223c 40\u201350 MeV), where F\u03bd0x \u226b F\u03bd0e (see Fig. 2) and flavor oscillation effects do not\ncancel. Of course, the next real supernova explosion might be characterized by a \"critical\nenergy\" different from this or other simulations.3 We shall discuss in Sec. IV A a possible\nway to circumvent our \"a priori\" ignorance of the real value of Ec , when seeking signatures\nof shock-wave effects.\nD.\n\nNeutrino interactions and detection\n\nIn large water-Cherenkov detectors, the interaction processes which can provide observable supernova neutrino event rates are: (i) inverse beta decay (possibly with neutron capture\nin Gd [18]); (ii) (anti)neutrino scattering on oxygen; and (iii) (anti)neutrino scattering on\nelectrons. For the process (i), we take the differential cross section from [41] (we recall that\nthe positron energy Epos closely tracks the neutrino energy E [41]). For the process (ii), we\ntake the total cross section from [42], where we have assumed the same energy distribution\nfor all the channels. The differential cross sections for the processes in (iii) are well-known\n(see, e.g., [17]).\nFor any interaction process, we fold the differential cross sections for e\u00b1 production with\na Gaussian energy resolution function of width \u2206, and apply a sharp cut to events with\nmeasured e\u00b1 energy below a threshold value Ethresh . The value of \u2206 is determined by the\nphotocatode coverage. For a coverage comparable to the current one in Super-Kamiokande II\n(\u223c 20% of the area [43]), as envisaged in typical Mton-class projects [8], we derive from the\ninformation in [43] that\nq\n\u2206/MeV \u2243 0.6 E/MeV .\n(15)\n3\n\nA remark is in order. The concept of \"critical energy\" is well defined only if the \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bdx energy spectra\nturn out to have different shapes and thus a crossing energy point, as is the case for the LL simulation [27]\nat Ec \u2243 20 MeV. Recent simulations [33] predict \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bdx spectrum differences which, although smaller\nthan in the LL case, in general still allow a meaningful definition of the critical energy.\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 5: Effective neutrino interaction cross sections as a function of energy, including energy resolution\nand threshold effects. See the text for details.\n\nWe also adopt the conservative value Ethresh = 7 MeV from [7]. The detection efficiency\n\u03b5 is assumed to be 1 above threshold. Unless otherwise noticed, the fiducial volume for\nsupernova neutrino detection is assumed to be 0.4 Mton [4, 7].\nFigure 5 shows the effective cross sections as a function of neutrino energy for the various\nprocesses discussed before, including resolution and threshold effects. Notice that, by adding\nGd [18], the neutron capture signature allows to detect sub-threshold inverse beta decay\nevents.\nIII.\n\nOBSERVABLES NOT PROBING SHOCK WAVES\n\nIn this Section we discuss the results of our calculations for time-integrated observables,\nsuch as the total number of events from a single supernova explosion or from the diffuse\nsupernova neutrino background, which are basically insensitive to shock-wave effects. Oscillation effects are simply accounted for by varying PH in its full range [0, 1] for both normal\nand inverted hierarchy (for a static profile, this is equivalent to vary sin2 \u03b813 in the currently\n< few%, see e.g., [10]).\nallowed range, sin2 \u03b813 \u223c\nA.\n\nTotal number of events\n\nFigure 6 shows the total number of events expected in a 0.4 Mton detector for various\ninteraction processes, as a function of the supernova distance in kpc. (For the sake of comparison, the vertical axis on the right refers to the number of events for a SK-like volume of\n\n10\n\n\fFIG. 6: Number of events expected in 0.4 Mton detector (left y-axis) or in a SK-like detector (right y-axis)\nas a function of the supernova distance, for various interaction channels. See the text for details.\n\n11\n\n\f22.5 kton). Relatively close stars which might evolve into core-collapse supernovae at unpredictable future times include Betelgeuse, Mira Ceti, and Antares. For close galaxies [44],\nthe rate of core-collapse supernovae may be inferred from their luminosity and morphology\n[45]; representative estimates based on [44, 45] (to be taken within a factor of two) are\nreported in the upper part of the figure for: the galactic center, the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC), and the M31+M33 spiral galaxies. For each interaction process, the uncertainty due\nto our ignorance of the hierarchy and of PH \u2208 [0, 1] is accounted for by the vertical spread\nof the bands. The relatively different spreads reflect different sensitivities to neutrino flavor\ntransitions. Let us now discuss the various classes of events from bottom to top.\nInverse beta decay events from silicon burning have very low (sub-threshold) positron\nenergies, and can only be detected through neutron capture by adding gadolinium [18],\nprovided that they can be statistically distinguished from background fluctuations. At a\ndistance of 1 kpc, we estimate \u223c 200 to \u223c 800 Si burning events over about two days. This\nlarge variation is due to the large ratio F\u03bd0e : F\u03bd0x \u2243 5 : 1 (see Sec IA), which implies F\u03bd e \u223c 0.2\u2013\n0.8 \u00d7 F\u03bd0e , where the lowest value is obtained for inverted hierarchy and PH = 0, while the\nhighest value is obtained for either inverted hierarchy with PH = 1 or for normal hierarchy.\nThe estimated signal rate of \u223c 100\u2013400 events/day at 1 kpc should be compared with\nthe background rate from spallation neutrinos (e.g., 1780 events/day at the Kamioka site),\nreactor neutrinos (e.g., \u223c 500 events/day at the Kamioka site), and from minor contributions\n(natural radioactivity). We have taken such backgrounds from [18] and rescaled them to\na 0.4 Mton mass. Assuming a typical total background rate of \u223c 2500 \u00b1 50 events per\nday (statistical errors only), the silicon burning signal should then be seen with a statistical\nsignificance of 2\u20138 standard deviations at a reference distance of 1 kpc. Unfortunately, at the\ngalactic center (\u223c 10 kpc) the estimated silicon burning signal would be 100 times smaller\nand thus unobservable.\nThere are better prospects to observe the neutronization burst from a galactic supernova\nby means of elastic scattering on electrons, including contributions from all flavors. The\ncontribution of antineutrinos can be neglected, being suppressed both by the original flux\nand by the cross section (see Figs. 1 and 5). The contribution of non-electron neutrino flavors\ncan be derived by using Eq. (10) or Eq. (12) plus the unitarity condition F\u03bde + F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u03c4 =\n\u2243 F\u03bd0e sin2 \u03b812\nF\u03bd0e + 2F\u03bd0x . In general, the dominant contribution comes from F\u03bde (with F\u03bdmax\ne\neither in normal hierarchy with PH = 1 or in inverted hierarchy), except for the case of\nnormal hierarchy with PH \u2243 0, where F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u03c4 \u2243 F\u03bd0e dominates. Therefore, we expect a\nsignal variation by a factor \u223c sin2 \u03b812 \u03c3\u03bde /\u03c3\u03bdx \u223c 2 (where \u03c3 is the elastic cross section), due\nto our ignorance of the hierarchy and of PH . Indeed, at 10 kpc we estimate from \u223c 12 to\n\u223c 22 events during the time interval of the neutronization peak (t \u2208 [42, 47] ms in the SN\nsimulation, see Fig. 1). The smallness of this time interval and the forward-peak signature of\nelastic events make this event sample basically background-free. In conclusion, a 0.4 Mton\ndetector might observe the neutronization signal from a galactic supernova with a typical\nstatistical significance of 3.5\u20134.7 standard deviations, assuming the emission model in Fig. 1.\nAt the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, however, the sensitivity drops dramatically\n[O(1) event, see Fig. 6].\nLet us now consider the (total) contributions from elastic scattering, absorption on oxygen, and inverse beta decay, integrated over the time interval t \u2208 [0, 14] s. For elastic\nscattering, the slanted band in Fig. 6 is characterized by the smallest vertical spread, since\nthe contributions from all flavors tend to partly cancel flavor transition effects. In a sense,\nthe elastic scattering event sample (\u223c 4 \u00d7 103 events at 10 kpc, easily separable through\n12\n\n\fforward-direction cuts) could be used as a reference value to estimate the original, unoscillated neutrino flux. The cross section for \u03bde and \u03bd e absorption on oxygen becomes rapidly\nlarger than the elastic scattering cross sections above \u223c 20 MeV (see Fig. 5), where the\nadopted energy spectra are still sizeable (see Fig. 2). At d = 10 kpc, we obtain about\n1.1 \u00d7 104 events (\u00b120% uncertainty from ignorance of the hierarchy and of PH ), with a\nsignificant contribution from \u03bde . If the case of normal hierarchy, the \u03bde contribution might\nprovide a handle to flavor transitions not observable in the \"canonical\" \u03bd e channel (inverse\nbeta decay), as we shall discuss in the context of shock-wave signatures. We remind that e\u00b1\nevents from (anti)neutrino absorption on oxygen are slightly backward peaked [42].\nFinally, the inverse beta decay channel will provide, in general, such a large statistics\nin a 0.4 Mton Cherenkov detector (\u223c 2 \u00d7 105 events at 10 kpc) that a handful of events\nmight be seen even at a distance as large as \u223c 1 Mpc. The high statistics available for a\ngalactic supernova explosion will allow many possible spectral analysis, examples of which\nwill be given in Sec. IV in the context of shock-wave effects. Here we simply notice that,\nsince the angular distribution of e+ from inverse beta decay is slightly forward peaked (see,\ne.g., [41]), a statistical separation from oxygen absorption events appears quite feasible, not\nonly for the total event sample, but also for subsamples (e.g., time or energy bins). For\ninstance, we have checked that, for an O(105) inverse beta decay event sample, the slope of\nthe positron distribution in cos \u03b8 (where \u03b8 is the scattering angle between \u03bd\u0304e and e+ ) changes\nsignificantly-with respect to the very small statistical errors-when O(104) oxygen events\nare added (not shown); further studies are needed, however, to make quantitative statements\nin this sense.\nB.\n\nSupernova relic neutrinos\n\nIn this section we study the flux of neutrinos coming from all past core-collapse supernovae\n(so-called Supernova Relic Neutrinos, SRN). Since the Super-Kamiokande SRN upper limit\nis only a factor of a few above typical flux estimates [9], the SRN detection through inverse\nbeta decay appears a feasible goal in Mton-class detectors, especially if the background\ncan be suppressed by capturing the neutron with gadolinium [18]. SRN detection might\nbe even closer [46] in view of recent experimental data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer\n(GALEX) mission [47], which suggest an increase of the estimated star formation rate (SFR)\nand thus of the SRN flux [46]. In the following, we present quantitative estimates of the SRN\nsignal (for a 0.4 Mton detector), based on the emission model discussed in Sec. II A and on\nthe same astrophysical input as we used in [48], except that we adopt here the lowest SFR\nfunction allowed by the (dust-corrected) GALEX and other data (i.e., the curve labeled as\n\"min AFUV \" in Fig. 5 of [47]), consistently with the \"concordance SFR\" advocated in [46].\nOur background estimates refer to the Kamioka site, for definiteness.\nFigure 7 shows, in the upper left panel, the absolute relic neutrino spectrum expected in\nthe two extreme cases of normal hierarchy and of inverted hierarchy with PH = 0, the latter\nbeing the most favorable in term of event rates. The abscissa is labelled by the measured\npositron energy. The vertical scale gives the number of events in 5 MeV bin of the measured\npositron energy, for an exposure of (0.4 Mton)\u00d7(4 years); for the sake of clarify, however, are\nshown as continuous curves rather than as 5-MeV bin histograms. In the upper left panel,\nwe also show the background from invisible muons (with normalization taken from the SK\nmeasurement [9], rescaled to 0.4 Mton), and the background from low-energy atmospheric\n\u03bde and \u03bd e , which we have calculated using the recent FLUKA fluxes [49]. We remind that\n13\n\n\fFIG. 7:\n\nSupernova relic neutrino signal and background for a hypothetical 0.4 Mton detector at the\nKamioka site, without and with gadolinium (left and right panels, respectively). Upper panels: Energy\nspectra of the signal and of atmospheric and reactor neutrino backgrounds. Lower panel: subtracted signal\nwith total statistical errors (for an exposure of 4 years).\n\nin the SRN energy range, the \u03bd e 's interact dominantly through inverse beta decay and\nsubdominantly through absorption on oxygen, while \u03bde 's dominantly scatter on oxygen. For\nsimplicity, we have assumed no atmospheric \u03bde or \u03bd e oscillations; however, as also remarked\nin [48], we stress that oscillation effects induced by the \"solar\" squared mass difference \u03b4m2\ncannot be totally neglected in this context, since \u03b4m2 R\u2295 /E \u223c O(1) in the energy range of\nFig. 7. The reactor neutrino background has been estimated on the basis of the spectrum\nshape in [50] (appropriate to parametrize the high-energy tail of the reactor spectrum),\nwith total normalization provided by the observed flux in the KamLAND experiment [35].\nFinally, a \u223c 20 MeV hard cut to reject spallation events [9] is also shown. In the upper right\n14\n\n\fpanel (as compared to the upper left one) we assume that inverse beta decay events can\nbe tagged by neutron capture in gadolinium. In this case, although the reactor background\ncannot be reduced (having the same signature as SRN events), spallation events are fully\nrejected. Concerning atmospheric neutrinos, it is estimated that invisible muon events and\n\u03bde oxygen absorption events can be reduced by a factor of \u223c 5 with gadolinium [51].\nFrom the comparison of the upper panels in Fig. 7 we learn that, even with gadolinium,\nthe extraction of the SRN signal requires a careful subtraction of (supposedly known) backgrounds from the total signal. Therefore, it is important to improve as much as possible\nthe knowledge of both the shape and the normalization of the background. In all cases, the\nshape is partly controlled by the energy resolution, which must be known very well; in fact,\nany increase or uncertainty in the resolution width \u2206 (due, e.g., to variation in the phototube coverage) will make some background event \"leak\" in the SRN sample, especially from\nthe reactor neutrino sample, characterized by a steeply falling spectrum. Further studies of\natmospheric neutrino fluxes [49] and of their interactions in oxygen [42] in the low-energy\nregime will also be beneficial to the reduce systematic uncertainties in the extraction of the\nSRN signal.\nIf we neglect systematics, the SRN number of event NS (derived from Ntot = NS \u221a\n+ NB ,\nwhere NB is the estimated number of background events) is affected\nby\nan\nerror\n\u00b1\nNtot .\n\u221a\nFigure 7 shows, in the lower panel, the prospective values of NS \u00b1 Ntot , for the less favorable\ncase of normal hierarchy. The impact of gadolinium is evident both as a reduction of the\nerror bars and as a reduction of the energy threshold for SRN detectability. However, even\nwithout gadolinium, a \u223c 2\u20133\u03c3 SRN signal could emerge after an exposure of 4 years with\n0.4 Mton. The situation would be more favorable in the case of inverted hierarchy with\nPH = 0 (not shown in the lower panels of Fig. 2).\nIn conclusion, there are good prospects to reveal a SRN signal with an exposure of a few\nyears in a 0.4 Mton detector, especially (but not necessarily) with the addition of gadolinium.\nFurther studies are needed, however, for a better characterization of the background. In\nparticular, in the SRN energy range, the tails of the reactor and atmospheric spectra, and\nof the energy resolution function, need to be under control to avoid migration of events.\nIV.\n\nOBSERVABLES PROBING SHOCK WAVES\n\nIn this Section we study possible signatures of shock-wave effects that might be seen in\na 0.4 Mton detector. We assume a galactic supernova (d = 10 kpc) and consider first the\nshock signatures in the absolute spectra of inverse beta decay events. We show then that a\nspecific spectral ratio can actually monitor the time dependence of the crossing probability\nPH , thus providing real-time information about the density profile. Finally, we show how\nevents from elastic scattering and absorption on oxygen can further help the discrimination\nof shock-wave effects.\nA.\n\nAbsolute time spectra from inverse beta decay\n\nInverse beta decay events can be sensitive to shock-wave effects on PH only in the case\nof inverted hierarchy [see Eqs. (9) and (11)]. However, inverted hierarchy is a necessary but\nnot sufficient condition. For \u03bd e 's with E \u223c Ec , where Ec is the critical energy introduced in\nSec. II C (Ec \u2243 20 MeV for the our adopted emission model), flavor transition effects will\n15\n\n\fbe largely cancelled, including matter effects along the shock profile. No such cancellation\nis expected, however, at higher energy (say, 45 MeV). Therefore, it makes sense to compare\nthe expected time spectra of events generated by neutrinos of relatively \"low\" energy (E \u223c\nEc \u223c 20 MeV) and relatively \"high\" energy (E \u223c EH \u223c 45 MeV) for both normal and\ninverted hierarchy, with and without shock in the latter case.\nFigures 8 and 9 show absolute time spectra of events for the cases of forward shock only\nand of forward plus reverse shock, respectively, for the same representative values of sin2 \u03b813\nused in Fig. 4. In both Fig. 8 and 9, the left (right) panels represent the time evolution of the\nnumber of events within the positron energy bin Epos = 20\u00b15 MeV, (Epos = 45\u00b15 MeV) for\nthe cases of normal hierarchy, inverted hierarchy with static profile, and inverted hierarchy\nwith dynamical shock profile. The number of events in the bin Epos = 45 \u00b1 5 MeV is\ngenerally smaller than for 20 \u00b1 5 MeV. The time spectra in the bin Epos = 45 \u00b1 5 MeV show\nstrong signatures of shock-wave effects for inverted hierarchy, in the form of non-monotonic\ntime variations of the event rate, especially at relatively high values of sin2 \u03b813 and in the\ncase of forward plus reverse shock. The amplitude of such variations is approximately\ncontained within the two extreme cases of inverted hierarchy with no shock and of normal\nhierarchy. Conversely, the shock-induced time variations in the bin Epos = 20 \u00b1 5 MeV are\nsignificantly smaller, and could be hardly characterized a priori as non-monotonic. This\nfeature can provide a sort of \"postdiction\" of the critical energy Ec , should real shock-wave\neffects be seen in a future supernova explosion: Ec could be identified as the energy where\nnonmonotonic time variations of the observed \u03bd\u0304e signal are most suppressed (as compared\nwith variations at higher energies). This empirical definition of Ec is sufficient for our\npurposes and, in any case, cannot be made more precise, both because Ec may fluctuate\nwith time and because the detector energy resolution function has a nonnegligible width.\nFinally, we observe that the high number of events in each time bin of Figs. 8 and 9 excludes\nthat the spectral variations (or their absence) can be obscured by statistical fluctuations.\nB.\n\nLow-to-high energy ratio of time spectra\n\nThe results discussed in the previous section suggest that the signatures of shock wave\neffects can be enhanced by comparing time spectra at the critical energy Ec , where, one has\nby construction\nF\u03bd e (Ec , t) \u223c F\u03bd0e (Ec , t) \u223c F\u03bd0x (Ec , t)\n(16)\nat any t [see Eqs. (13) and (14)], with time spectra at significantly higher energy EH , where\none expects F\u03bd0e \u226a F\u03bd0x (see Figs. 1 and 2) and thus\nF\u03bd e (EH , t) \u2243 sin2 \u03b812 F\u03bd0x (EH , t)\n\n(17)\n\nfor normal hierarchy [Eq. (9)] and\nF\u03bd e (EH , t) \u2243 [1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b812 PH (E, t)]F\u03bd0x (EH , t)\n\n(18)\n\nfor inverted hierarchy [Eq. (10)]. It is convenient to choose EH so that the flux reduction\nfrom Ec to EH [F\u03bd0x (EH )/F\u03bd0x (Ec ) \u226a 1] is roughly compensated by the increase of the inverse\nbeta decay cross section [\u03c3(EH ) \u226b \u03c3(Ec )],\nF\u03bd0x (Ec ) \u03c3(Ec )\n\u223c1.\nF\u03bd0x (EH ) \u03c3(EH )\n16\n\n(19)\n\n\fFIG. 8: Absolute time spectra of events from inverse beta decay in a 0.4 Mton detector, in the presence of\nforward shock only, for four representative values of sin2 \u03b813 . The solid, dashed, and dotted histograms refer\nto calculations in inverted hierarchy with shock effects, inverted hierarchy with a static density profile, and\nnormal hierarchy, respectively. In each panel, the left (right) panels refer to the energy bin Epos = 20 \u00b1 5\n(45 \u00b1 5) MeV.\n\n17\n\n\fFIG. 9: As in Fig. 8, but for the case of forward plus reverse shock.\n\n18\n\n\fWith such choice for EH , one can derive from the previous equations the following approximate ratio of inverse beta decay events at Ec and EH :\nN(Ec , t)\n1\n\u223c\n2\nN(EH , t)\nsin \u03b812\n\n(20)\n\nN(Ec , t)\n1\n\u223c\n2\nN(EH , t)\n1 \u2212 cos \u03b812 PH (EH , t)\n\n(21)\n\nfor normal hierarchy and\n\nfor inverted hierarchy.\nFor our adopted emission model, the condition in Eq. (19) is fulfilled at EH \u223c 45 MeV,\nwhich explains a posteriori our choice for the \"high\" energy bin in Figs. 8 and 9. Other\nchoices for EH around 45 MeV would simply provide an overall factor on the right hand side\nof Eqs. (20) and (21), with no substantial change in the following discussion.\nFigure 10 shows the ratio of events in the 20 \u00b1 5 MeV bin with respect to events in\nthe 45 \u00b1 5 MeV bin, as compared with the function [1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b812 PH (EH , t)]\u22121 . Notice that\nthis function has the same qualitative behavior as PH (EH , t) itself (see Fig. 4). It can be\nseen that, in inverted hierarchy, shock effects are faithfully monitored by the chosen ratio\nof events, i.e., there is a striking correspondence (even in absolute values, within a factor of\n2 or better) between the solid histograms on the right and the solid curves on the left in\nFig. 10, up to smearing effects due to the detector resolution. For inverted hierarchy with no\nshock (dashed curves and histograms) there is also a reasonable correspondence of the event\nratio on the right with the constant value on the left. For normal hierarchy, as expected, any\ninformation on PH is lost. Therefore, in the case of inverted hierarchy, the ratio of events\nat \"high energy\" and \"critical energy\" appears as a useful tool to track the main variations\n(and possibly the absolute value) of the crossing probability PH , from which one could get\nprecious information about the density gradient along the shock profile.\nFigure 11 is analogous to Fig. 10, but for the the case of forward plus reverse shock.\nDespite the more complex structure of the crossing probability function, its behavior is\nfaithfully tracked by the ratio of events shown on the right (for inverted hierarchy), except\nperhaps at the lowest value of sin2 \u03b813 shown. In any case, the main spikes and valleys of the\nfunction [1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b812 PH (EH , t)]\u22121 are clearly reproduced by the (20 \u00b1 5)/(45 \u00b1 5) MeV event\nratio, and cannot be mimicked by the very small statistical fluctuations (not shown). Of\ncourse, relations in Eqs. (19), (20), and (21) are only approximated, and this is the reason\nwhy, for example, in the case of normal hierarchy (dotted line in Figs. 10 and 11) or inverted\nhierarchy with static profile and sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22125 (dashed line in the lower right panels of\nFigs. 10 and 11) the ratio does not appear constant in time.\nOf course, when the next observable supernova will explode, we will not know a priori\nthe values of Ec and of EH fulfilling Eqs. (16) and (19). However, if an imprint of shock\nwaves is seen in the absolute spectra through nonmonotonic time variations, Ec can be\nfound by seeking the (low) energy range where such variations are suppressed, as already\nmentioned. Concerning EH , its ignorance is not crucial to track the qualitative behavior of\nPH (t): histograms very similar to those shown in the right panels of Figs. 10 and 11 would\nbe obtained by using, e.g., the 40 \u00b1 5 MeV or 50 \u00b1 5 MeV bin instead of 45 \u00b1 5 MeV, up to\nan overall rescaling of the y-axis (not shown).\n\n19\n\n\fFIG. 10: Time dependence of the ratio of events between the energy bins Epos = 20 \u00b1 5 MeV and\nEpos = 45 \u00b1 5 MeV (right), compared with the function [1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b812 PH (EH , t)]\u22121 with EH = 45 MeV\n(right). It appears that, for inverted hierarchy, the event ratio on the right tracks rather well the function\nstructures on the left (up to smearing effects), thus providing a \"shock wave monitor\" in real time.\n\n20\n\n\fFIG. 11: As in Fig. 10, but for the case of forward+reverse shock.\n\n21\n\n\fFIG. 12: Time spectra of total oxygen absorption events for normal and inverted hierarchy, and for static\nand shock profiles (with sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22122 ).\nC.\n\nTime spectra from interactions on oxygen and on electrons\n\nBoth \u03bde and \u03bd e contribute to oxygen absorption events. Therefore, shock wave imprints\nare expected for both inverted and normal hierarchy. Figure 12 shows the time spectra of\nsuch events for both normal and inverted hierarchy, using either the static or the forward\nshock-wave profile for sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22122 . It can be seen that, in the presence of the shock,\nthe event decrease in time is first steepened and then flattened for both hierarchies; in the\ncase of inverted hierarchy, there is even a small dip at 9\u201310 seconds. Therefore, if the time\ndecrease of the event rate is understood from simulations or from independent experimental\ninformation, the identification of a steepening+flattening behavior in oxygen events might\nbe taken as a signal of shock passage (in the absence of alternative explanations).\n22\n\n\fFIG. 13: Time spectra of total elastic scattering events in normal and inverted hierarchy (with forward\nshock profile), for sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22122 and 0.\n\nIndependent experimental information on the time decrease of the (anti)neutrino flux\ncan be gained through elastic scattering events. Since neutrinos of all flavors contribute\nto this sample, partial cancellation of oscillation effects occurs, as remarked in Sec. III A\nfor the total rate in this class of events. Figure 13 shows that the partial cancellation\npersists also in the time spectra, i.e., there are no large variations between normal and\ninverted hierarchy and with or without crossing probability effects (sin2 \u03b813 = 10\u22122 or 0).\nTherefore, the elastic scattering sample is expected to track the overall decrease of flux in\ntime, rather independently of flavor transition effects. This \"standard candle\" will be useful\nfor comparison with the oxygen and inverse beta decay sample, where shock-wave effects\ncan instead range from moderate to strong.\n\n23\n\n\fV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have analyzed the discovery potential of a 0.4 Mton water-Cherenkov\ndetector in providing information on several time dependent and independent observables\nrelated to (extra)galactic core-collapse supernovae. We have considered elastic scattering on\nelectrons as well as inelastic scattering on protons and on oxygen in the detector.\nConcerning time independent observables, we have calculated the total number of events\nas a function of the distance of the exploding star for each detection channel during: a)\nthe last pre-supernova (silicon burning) phase; b) the neutronization burst; and c) the core\n< 5 MeV) thermal neutrinos emitted\ncollapse phase. We have shown that the low energy (E \u223c\nduring the Si burning phase a couple of days before the explosion can be identified at 2\u03c3\n< 1 kpc) and the detector is\nlevel over typical backgrounds if the supernova is not too far (d \u223c\nloaded with gadolinium. The neutronization burst \u03bde 's can be identified with a significance\n>\n<\n\u223c 3 standard deviations if d \u223c 10 kpc. From core collapse supernovae located near to the\ngalactic center we expect up to O(105) events from inverse beta decay events, and O(104)\nevents coming from elastic scattering and and oxygen absorption events. At the larger\ndistance of, e.g., the Andromeda galaxy (M31), we expect O(10) events, thus opening a\npossible window for near extragalactic supernova surveys.\nWe have shown that with the addition of gadolinium, the energy range [10, 30] MeV can\nbe fully exploited to detect the supernova relic neutrino flux at the level of several standard\ndeviations in a few years. However, even without gadolinium, the SRN background could\nemerge at \u223c 2\u20133\u03c3 level after an exposure of \u223c 4 years, if the atmospheric background is\nunder control.\nWe have then studied the time spectra of events in the range t \u2208 [2, 14] s, in order to\nextract information on the neutrino crossing probability induced by the shock wave propagation in the stellar envelope during the cooling phase. In particular, we have considered the\nhigh statistic sample of inverse beta decay events. In this context, it is useful to introduce\nthe concept of \"critical energy\" (Ec \u2243 20 MeV for our reference model), where oscillation\neffect cancel to a large extent. In this way, the time dependence of the rate of the events\nin a bin around the critical energy is mainly affected by the overall decrease of the neutrino luminosity, and is almost independent from the time dependence of the probability.\nWe have shown that the ratio between the number of events in a bin close to the critical\nenergy (Ec = 20 \u00b1 5 MeV) and those in a bin centered at a significantly higher energy (e.g.,\nEH = 45 \u00b1 5 MeV) can faithfully track the neutrino crossing probability (if the mass hierarchy is inverted), thus providing a \"real-time\" movie of shock wave effects into the stellar\nenvelope. In particular, the case of forward shock only [28] and of forward+reverse shock [16]\nleave significantly different signatures in the time domain, and can thus be discriminated.\nWe have completed our work by considering the time dependence of the neutrino event\nrates from oxygen absorption and from elastic scattering. The latter are almost independent\nfrom shock and flavor transition effects, and can thus be used to monitor the overall decay\nof neutrino luminosity. The former (oxygen) event rate is instead sensitive to the shock\nwave also in the case of normal hierarchy (due to the \u03bde contribution). If a \"steepeningflattening\" behavior is observed in the oxygen event time spectrum, it could be interpreted\nas an imprint of the shock wave passage, in both cases of normal and inverted hierarchy.\nIn conclusion, Megaton-class detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to study supernova and neutrino properties through high-statistics studies of energy and time spectra of\nsupernova neutrino events from different interaction channels. Directions for further studies\n24\n\n\fmay include detector simulations of the statistical separation between such channels, more\nrefined calculations of the oxygen absorption differential cross section, improved numerical\nsimulations of supernova explosion and shock-wave behavior, a better understanding of the\nunoscillated neutrino spectra in time and energy (and of their associated uncertainties), and\nan accurate characterization of the atmospheric and reactor background in supernova relic\nneutrino searches.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank J.
