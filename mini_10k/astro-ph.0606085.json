This variability was discovered with RXTE (Bradt et al., 1993)\njust ten years ago in the form of kilo-Hz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in\nFourier power density spectra (see the review by van der Klis (2005) and Fig.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n15 October 2018\n\n\fFig. 1. Power density spectrum of Sco X-1 in a \u03bdF \u03bd-like representation, showing\ntwo kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (data courtesy of Michiel van der Klis).\n\n1). There is a wide consensus that these QPOs probe the motion of matter under strong gravity with the signal originating from within a few Schwarzschild\nradii of the compact star. This is a region where the spacetime curvature is\nextreme, orders of magnitude larger than that sampled in weak field tests (e.g.\nGravity-Probe B). This is a regime where the most dramatic effects of GR are\nexpected, and where fundamental predictions of GR, such as the existence of\nan innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) have yet be tested. With RXTE,\nX-ray timing has thus become a complementary tool to X-ray spectroscopy,\npolarimetry and gravitational wave measurements to probe strong field GR.\nIt has even been claimed that studying black hole variability might be used\nto test alternative theories of gravity (Psaltis, 2004).\n\n1.1 Overall QPO properties\nIt is is beyond the scope of this paper to review the properties of kHz QPOs,\nand the reader is referred to van der Klis (2005) for a recent review and Xray Timing 2003 - Rossi and Beyond by Kaaret, Lamb and Swank (2004,\nAIP Conference Proceedings, Vol. 714, Melville, NY: American Institute of\nPhysics) on which the present paper draws heavily on. Here I will focus on\ntheir general properties, relevant to some of the points discussed below. So\nfar, kHz QPOs have been detected from about 20 neutron star low-mass Xray binaries (about 10% of known systems) (Swank, 2004), and from a handful\nof binaries containing a black hole candidate. In general two kHz QPOs are\nobserved. The properties of the QPO (frequency, amplitude, width) vary in a\ncomplicated way with parameters such as the source luminosity. For neutron\n2\n\n\fstars, the QPO frequencies can vary by at least two orders of magnitude with\nthe amplitude decreasing with increasing frequency. There is a trend for the\nQPO fractional amplitude to increase with energy, reaching in some cases\n20% at \u223c 20 keV. In black holes, QPOs are detected closer to the sensitivity\nlimit of RXTE with typical amplitudes of 1%: they are transient, show stable\nfrequencies and are detected in the hardest X-ray bands (typically above 10\nkeV) (Remillard, 2004).\n\n1.2 QPO interpretation\n\nThe true nature of the underlying signal is unknown and there is a wide\nrange of possible models to be considered, mostly focussing on predicting\nQPO frequencies. Because the disk is a natural source of periodicities, from\norbital to epicyclic motions and disk oscillations, it is generally agreed that\nQPOs originate in the cool (\u223c 1 \u2212 2 keV) accretion disk. This implicitly\nassumes that the oscillator must survive the strong damping forces thought\nto be present in the disk and that an amplification mechanism operates to\naccount for the fact that QPOs show larger amplitude at higher energies (\u223c\n10 \u2212 20 keV). For neutron star QPOs, the main constraint for the models\nso far comes the observation that the frequency separation between the twin\nQPOs is close to the spin frequency or half the spin frequency of the neutron\nstar (where that is known). This strongly suggests that the spin is involved\nin the generation of the QPOs. For black holes, the main constraint for the\nmodels comes from the observations that QPOs, when observed in pairs, have\ncommensurate frequencies, with ratios close to small integer ratios (e.g. 3:2)\n(Remillard, 2004), lending support to the idea that a resonance mechanism is\ninvolved in the make up of the QPOs.\nSome models (not all of them consistent with the constraints above) relate\nQPO frequencies directly characteristic frequencies of test particles moving\nin the strongly curved spacetime (General Relativistic orbital and epicyclic\nfrequencies (Abramowicz and Klu\u017aniak, 2004)), others link the QPO frequencies to the frequency of orbiting clumps interacting with radiation from the\nneutron star (Miller et al., 1998). Some models involve global disk oscillations,\nrelativistic (Kato, 2001), or not (Titarchuk and Wood, 2004). Yet others associate QPOs with strong field GR effects, e.g. relativistic dragging of inertial\nframes (Stella and Vietri, 1999), see (van der Klis, 2005) for a more complete\nlist of references.\nThere is however a trend in the models to associate QPOs with resonance\nphenomena, involving General Relativistic frequencies. As an example, in the\naccreting millisecond pulsar, SAXJ1808-3658, it has been proposed that the\ntwo QPOs (whose frequency difference is just equal to half the neutron star\n3\n\n\fspin frequency) are generated at a radius in the disk where the difference between the general relativistic orbital frequency and radial epicyclic frequency\nis equal to half the spin frequency (Wijnands et al., 2003). Similarly, to account for the 3:2 frequency ratios observed in black hole systems, a parametric\nresonance concept has been put forward, in which the QPOs are produced at\na radius in the disk where two of the three general relativistic frequencies (orbital, vertical and radial epicyclic) have commensurate values, matching the\nobserved QPO frequencies (Abramowicz and Klu\u017aniak, 2004). Although this\nis still very much under discussion, it is interesting to note that the latter two\nmodels link QPOs directly to general relativistic frequencies.\n\n1.3 The innermost stable circular orbit\n\nThe ISCO is one of the key predictions of strong gravity GR stating that\nthere exists a region around sufficiently compact stars within which no stable\ncircular orbital motion is possible. In a Schwarzschild geometry, the radius of\nthe ISCO is 6GM/c2 , which is larger than the radii of neutron stars, deduced\nfrom models constructed with most modern high-density equations of state\n(Akmal et al., 1998). Interestingly enough, claims have already been made\nthat the QPO properties have revealed signatures of the ISCO. Prior to the\nlaunch of RXTE, it was suggested that the ISCO might induce a frequency\ncutoff in the power density spectrum (Kluzniak et al., 1990). After the discovery of kHz QPOs, it was proposed that signatures of the ISCO could include\na frequency saturation of kHz QPOs with increasing mass accretion rate, or a\ndrop in the quality factor and amplitude of kHz QPOs as they approach a limiting frequency (Miller et al., 1998). A saturation of the QPO frequency with\ncount rate (Zhang et al., 1998) or inferred mass accretion rate (Bloser et al.,\n2000), as well as a sudden drop of coherence and amplitude at some critical\nfrequency (Barret et al., 2005b) have now been reported. Although the interpretation of these results is still debated, this demonstrates the potential of\nfast X-ray timing for testing the existence of the ISCO. Note that identifying securely a frequency with an orbital frequency at the ISCO would yield\ndirectly the mass of the neutron star.\n\n1.4 QPO and the black hole spin and mass\n\nDepending on the interpretation, parameters such as the spin and the mass of\nblack holes can be constrained directly from measuring the QPO frequencies. One example is given in Fig. 2 where the most model independent\nconstraint is used. It simply assumes that the QPO frequency is smaller\nthan the orbital frequency at the ISCO (the latter being a function of the\n4\n\n\fFig. 2. Left) The azimuthal (f\u03c6 ), radial epicyclic (\u03ba), and vertical (f\u22a5 ) frequencies at different radii around a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.2. Right)\nDashed Lines: the dynamical measurement of the black-hole mass in the source\nGRO 1655\u221240. Solid Line: the minimum spin parameter a/M for each black-hole\nmass, for which the observed 450 Hz QPO can be produced as a Keplerian frequency\nof a stable orbit. According to this argument, the black hole in GRO 1655\u221240 is\nspinning with a/M > 0.2 (Both figures from (Psaltis, 2004))\n\nblack hole mass and spin). More stringent constraints on the black hole mass\nand spin can be obtained from models involving resonance between relativistic frequencies (Psaltis, 2004; Abramowicz and Klu\u017aniak, 2004). All constraints point to maximally spinning black holes. As an application, because\nof the 1/M dependency of all general relativistic frequencies, it has been proposed that measuring QPOs from Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources, whose nature is a mystery, might help in constraining the mass of the compact object\n(Abramowicz and Klu\u017aniak, 2004) in these systems.\n\n2\n\nFast X-ray timing and matter at supra-nuclear density\n\nBesides providing a laboratory to test GR, neutron stars have also other interesting properties; some may be powerful emitters of gravitational waves at\ntheir millisecond spin periods, some have an extreme magnetic field in which\nstrong-field QED effects can be studied. But the overall reason why neutron\nstars have stimulated much work is because the physical state of the matter\nwhich makes up their cores is still a mystery. The density of a neutron star can\nreach up to 10 times the density of a nucleus; besides neutrons and protons,\nat such high densities the physics of strong interactions predicts the existence\nof hyperons - particles that contain strange quarks - pions and kaon condensates, or even free quarks. Neutron stars offer the only possibility of detecting\nsuch exotic matter in the bulk, and resolving the question of the most stable\n5\n\n\fform of matter (baryons or free quarks). Since the structure of neutron stars\nis set by the, yet unknown, equation of state of matter at these high densities,\nmeasurements of neutron stars masses and radii can provide information not\nonly on the physical makeup of neutron stars, but also on the nature of the\ninteractions between the particles that constitute them. The equation of state\nof nuclear matter is at the heart of many fundamental problems in physics,\nfrom nuclear physics to condensed matter physics, including superconductivity\nand super-fluidity. Fast X-ray timing and high resolution spectroscopy (e.g.\nredshifted lines emitted at the neutron star surface) holds great potential for\nconstraining the physics of strong interactions.\n\n2.1 QPOs and the equation of state of dense matter\n\nIf QPOs arise from stable orbital motion (the highest frequency QPO is generally associated with an orbital frequency in most models), the frequency yields\nthe orbital radius at which it is produced. Hence this orbital radius limits the\nmass and the radius of the neutron star (Miller et al., 1998). This is because\ntwo types of constraints can be set. The first one uses the fact that no QPOs\nare expected to be produced within the ISCO, hence the orbital radius must\nbe larger than the radius of the ISCO (6GM/c2 in a Schwarzschild geometry).\nThe second constraint simply states that the radius of the neutron star is\nsmaller than the orbital radius. So far, the highest QPO frequency is 1330 Hz,\nlimiting the mass and radius of the neutron star in the bottom left area of Fig\n3.\n\n2.2 Waveform fitting of neutron star X-ray oscillations and dense matter\n\nThe discovery of the first accreting millisecond pulsar (a handful are known\ntoday) and transient oscillations in type I X-ray bursts in a dozen sources\nhave provided us with additional tools to constrain dense matter. This is\nbecause these pulsations are likely caused by hot spots rotating at the surface\nof the neutron star (Muno, 2004; Strohmayer, 2004). The emission from the\nspot will travel in a strongly curved space time before reaching the observer,\nand will be subject to a variety of effects, including relativistic aberration,\nDoppler boosting and strong field gravitational light bending (Poutanen, 2004;\nStrohmayer, 2004). The more compact the star, the smoother will be the pulse\nprofile. Fitting of the pulse profile of the oscillations with generic light curves\ncomputed under specific assumptions (spacetime metric, geometry, emission\npattern and spectrum of the spot,....) has already demonstrated the potential\nof this approach to constrain the compactness of the star, especially when\nthe harmonic content of the oscillations is also detected (Strohmayer, 2004;\n6\n\n\fFig. 3. left) Constraints from orbital frequencies. The 1330 Hz curve is for the\nhighest kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation frequency yet measured. This curve is for\na non-rotating star; the constraint wedge would be enlarged slightly for a rotating\nstar. The solid lines are mass-radius curves for different representative high-density\nequations of state. Right) Constraints on mass and radius for hypothetical detections\nof a 1500 Hz QPO and a 1800 Hz QPO, if they are identified with an orbital\nfrequency. At 1500 Hz one expects signatures of the ISCO to be present; a detection\nof 1800 Hz would present strong difficulties for standard nucleonic equations of state.\nBoth figures taken from Miller (2004).\n\nBhattacharyya et al., 2005).\n\n3\n\nFrom RXTE to XEUS: From 0.7 m2 to \u223c 10 m2\n\nAs stressed above, we are at the beginning of a new era, which means that the\nfull potential of the RXTE discoveries is difficult to anticipate. It is however\nclear that fast X-ray timing holds promises to address some of the most important issues of modern astrophysics, such as strong gravity, accretion disk\nphysics, and the physics of the strong interactions. The obvious path forward\nwill therefore require an instrument with a significant increase in sensitivity\ncompared to RXTE. For timing, the significance of a QPO detection scales\nproportionally with the number of photons collected per unit time, hence the\nwith collecting area of the instrumentation. Given that RXTE has a collecting\narea of \u223c 0.7 m2 , a \u223c 10 m2 class X-ray telescope (with say 3 m2 effective\narea at 6 keV) has the potential to provide an improvement in sensitivity for\ntiming measurements by more than one order of magnitude over RXTE. Such\nan instrumentation would allow breakthrough science in several ways. The\nmost important ones are listed below.\n7\n\n\f3.1 Breakthrough\n\nIt is already clear that with RXTE, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg of\nthe high frequency phenomena around compact stars. A factor of 3 to 4 weaker\nsignals in terms of RMS amplitude will be detected with a 10 m2 instrumentation. Side-band frequencies, predicted in some models, will be detected, whose\ninter-dependence will help in revealing their nature. Measuring simultaneously\nthree frequencies could establish their identification with GR frequencies, if for\ninstance they vary in the way predicted. New analysis techniques, such as the\none based on the bicoherence, which measures the degree of phase coupling\nbetween oscillations at different frequencies, might be sensitive enough to discriminate between models (Maccarone and Schnittman, 2005). Furthermore,\nbecause the RMS amplitude of the QPO decreases with increasing frequencies, QPOs will be detected at frequencies higher than currently achieved with\nRXTE. This would allow a search for the frequency ceiling expected at the\nISCO and, provided that the orbital nature of the signal is demonstrated,\nwould restrict critically the region of acceptance for neutron star masses and\nradii, hence allowing some proposed equations of state to be eliminated (see\nFig 3).\nA second breakthrough would be the determination of the underlying modulation mechanism of the signal. In general, it is simply assumed that a QPO\nsignal is made of sine-wave damped exponential shots, with a time constant\n(also called coherence time) which relates to the measured width of the QPO\nin the Fourier spectrum. Coherence time of the order of 0.1 second have been\ninferred this way (Barret et al., 2005a,b). Because this estimate is computed\nby averaging the signal over thousands of cycles it should be considered as a\nlower limit (frequency drifts will artificially broaden the signal, thus reducing\nthe inferred coherence time). A 10 m2 class instrumentation will enable to\nstudy kilo-Hz QPOs on timescales comparable to their coherence times. This\nwill allow one to test whether the signal is persistent or transient, intrinsically\naperiodic or made of a superposition of more coherent pulses. The true lifetime\nof the underlying oscillator may well be one of the most stringent constraints\nto the models (Barret et al., 2005b). Depending on the nature of the underlying signal, time-resolved spectroscopy over its coherence time may become\npossible, yielding information on the radius where the signal originates (e.g.\nby detecting Doppler shifts).\nThe broad iron line seen from stellar mass black holes (Miniutti et al., 2004)\nprovides complementary diagnostics of the strong field region. The profile of\nthe line is also broadened and distorted by relativistic effects (Doppler shift\nand beaming, gravitational redshift,...). Combining fast timing and moderate\nresolution spectroscopy will help in testing models and in determining the true\nnature of the underlying variability. As an example, proving the orbital nature\n8\n\n\fFig. 4. Simulated light curve of a burst oscillation at 300 Hz as seen by the\nRXTE/PCA and XEUS. The burst produces 15000 counts/s in the PCA, and\n400000 count/s in XEUS. The simulations take into account gravitational light\nbending in a Schwarzschild spacetime (one spot and a cosine emission diagram).\nFor XEUS, the light curve is computed for two neutron star compactness (M/R=0.1\nand 0.28): the oscillations are directly visible in the light curve even at the highest\ncompactness, whereas they are invisible in the PCA data (Barret 2004).\n\nof the signal could be achieved by measuring independently the frequency,\nfrom timing, and the radius at which it is generated from continuum or line\nspectroscopy (van der Klis, 2004, 2005).\nFor waveform fitting of X-ray burst and persistent oscillations, a 10 m2 instrumentation would enable the signal to be detected over one cycle (it will\nalso be very sensitive to the harmonic content of the signal). By fitting the\nwaveform, it will be possible to investigate the spacetime around the neutron\nstar, and simultaneously constrain its mass and radius, and hence constrain\nthe equation of state of its high density core with unprecedented accuracy\n(Strohmayer, 2004) (see Fig 4).\n\n3.2 XEUS lining up in the ESA Cosmic Vision\nThe ESA Cosmic Vision exercise has defined key goals to be addressed in the\nscience program for the time period 2015 to 2025. Among those goals, the\nstudy of matter under extreme conditions (gravity in the strong field limit\nand the equation of state of dense matter) requires a large aperture X-ray observatory. In parallel, the XEUS mission concept has recently evolved, thanks\nto the prospects of using light weight Si HPO optics, capable of reaching\na 5 arcsec spatial resolution (Parmar et al., 2003). Rapid progress is being\nmade and continued development will ensure that a mirror area of 10 m2 can\nbe flown with a single launch to the second Earth-Sun Lagrangian point (L2)\n9\n\n\fand autonomous deployment (Bavdaz et al., 2003). To address specifically the\nMatter under extreme condition goal of the Cosmic Vision program, a dedicated timing instrument, capable of coping with the count rates expected from\nthe bright sources of the sky is now in the baseline focal plane instrumentation. The detector implementation described in Barret (2004) is designed to\nprovide an order of magnitude improvement for timing studies over RXTE,\nwhile providing more than a factor of 5 better spectral resolution, making\npossible to combine timing and spectroscopic measurements.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nRXTE has opened a brand new window on fundamental physics. Gravity in\nthe strong field limit and matter at supra-nuclear density, which constitute\nthe core of the RXTE legacy, have been identified as key science goals to be\npursued in the science program of ESA after 2015. XEUS, which is foreseen as\na potential mission for this time period, now has a dedicated timing detector\nin the focal plane baseline, with capabilities matching the requirements for\na follow-up instrumentation to RXTE. XEUS has therefore a great potential\nfor delivering unique science on strong gravity and dense matter, building on\nwhat has been learned in the last few years with RXTE.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to thank all colleagues who gave me their support for bringing a fast\ntiming capability in the XEUS focal plane instrumentation.
