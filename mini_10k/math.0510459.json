We prove that two links related by a surgery along a connected,\nstrict graph clasper of degree n are Cn -equivalent, i.e, related by a sequence\nof surgeries along strict tree claspers of degree n.\n\n1. Introduction\nGoussarov [6, 7] and the author [8] independently introduced topological calculus of surgery along claspers. One of the main achievements in these theories is\nthe following characterization of the topological information carried by GoussarovVassiliev finite type invariants [10, 4, 5, 2, 3, 9, 1]: Two knots in S 3 have the same\nvalues for any Goussarov-Vassiliev invariant of degree < n if and only if they are\nrelated by a sequence of Cn -moves [7, 8]. Here a Cn -move is defined as surgery\nalong a certain type of tree clasper, which is a framed unitrivalent tree with each\nunivalent vertex attached to the knot.\nIn [8, \u00a78.2], the author also introduced the notion of graph claspers for links,\nwhich is a generalization of the notion of tree claspers, where the tree part is replaced by a unitrivalent graph. There we explained the idea that graph claspers may\nbe regarded as topological realizations of unitrivalent graphs (also called Feynman\ndiagrams, Jacobi diagrams, etc.) used by Bar-Natan [1] to describe the structure of\nthe graded quotients of the Goussarov-Vassiliev filtration. Recall that, in the diagram level, any connected, unitrivalent graph diagram on a 1-manifold is equivalent\nunder the ST U relations to a linear combination of tree diagrams. The purpose\nof this short note is to prove a topological version of the above-mentioned fact:\nsurgery along a strict graph clasper G for a link can be replaced by a sequence of\nsurgeries along strict tree claspers of the same degree as G.\n2. Definitions\nWe freely use the definitions, notations and conventions in [8].\nIn the following, M denotes a compact, connected, oriented 3-manifold.\nA tangle \u03b3 in M is a \"link\" in the sense of [8, \u00a71.1], i.e., a proper embedding\nf : \u03b1 \u2192 M of a compact, oriented 1-manifold \u03b1 into M . As usual, we systematically\nconfuse \u03b3 and the image \u03b3(\u03b1) \u2282 M . A link in the usual sense is a tangle consisting\nonly of circle components.\nTwo tangles \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 in M are equivalent, denoted by \u03b3 \u223c\n= \u03b3 \u2032 , if \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 are\nambient isotopic fixing the endpoints.\nDate: October 21, 2005.\nKey words and phrases. tree claspers, graph claspers, Cn -equivalence, Goussarov-Vassiliev\nfinite type link invariants.\nThis research was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,\nGrant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B), 16740033.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKAZUO HABIRO\n\nG'\nmove 9\n\n~\n=\n\nL\n\nFigure 1.\nFor the definitions of claspers, tree claspers and graph claspers, see [8, \u00a71, \u00a72,\n\u00a78.2]. Note that a tree clasper is a special kind of connected graph clasper. A\ngraph clasper G is called strict if G has no leaves. I.e., a strict graph clasper is a\nclasper consisting only of disk-leaves, nodes, and edges.\nAn important property of a strict graph clasper G for a tangle \u03b3 in M is that\nG is tame (see [8, \u00a72.3]), and consequently surgery along G does not change the\n3-manifold up to canonical homeomorphism. (The proof of this fact is similar to\n[8, Proposition 3.3].) Thus we may regard the result \u03b3 G from \u03b3 of surgery along G\nas a tangle in M .\nA disk-leaf A in a clasper for a tangle \u03b3 is simple if A intersects \u03b3 by only one\npoint. A strict graph clasper is simple if all the disk-leaves are simple.\nFor k \u2265 1, a Cn -move is a local move on a tangle defined as surgery along a strict\ntree clasper of degree n. The Cn -equivalence on tangles is generated by Cn -moves\nand equivalence.\n3. Statement and proof of the result\nThe purpose of this note is to prove the following.\nTheorem 1 (Stated in a different form in [8, \u00a78.2, p.68, l.4]). Let \u03b3 be a tangle in\na compact, connected, oriented 3-manifold M , and let G be a strict graph clasper\nfor \u03b3 in M of degree n \u2265 1, which is not necessarily simple. Then \u03b3 and \u03b3 G are\nCn -equivalent. (Consequently, by [8, Theorem 3.17], there are finitely many disjoint\nsimple tree claspers T1 , . . . , Tp for \u03b3 of degree n such that \u03b3 G \u223c\n= \u03b3 T1 \u222a***\u222aTp .)\nProof. We may safely assume that G is connected.\nThe proof is by induction on the number e(G) of edges in G. If e(G) = 1, then\nG is already a strict tree clasper, and hence the assertion follows.\nLet e(G) > 1. If we have the assertion for the case when G is simple, then we\nhave the general case by replacing a single strand by a parallel family of strands.\nHence we may assume that G is simple. (This assumption is just for simplifying\nexplanations and figures.) Choose any disk-leaf L of G. Since e(G) > 1, L is joined\nby an edge to a node. Let G\u2032 denote the the strict graph clasper obtained from\nG by move 9 of [8, Proposition 2.7] and isotopy as depicted in Figure 1. We have\n\u2032\n\u03b3G \u223c\n= \u03b3 G . There are two cases.\nCase 1. G\u2032 is connected. Since e(G\u2032 ) = e(G) \u2212 1 and deg G\u2032 = deg G, the\nassertion follows from the induction hypothesis.\nCase 2. G\u2032 consists of two components G1 and G2 . We have\n(3.1)\n\u03b3 G1 \u222aG2 \u223c\n= \u03b3G,\n(3.2)\n\ndeg G1 + deg G2 = deg G = n.\n\n\fREPLACING A GRAPH CLASPER BY TREE CLASPERS\n\nF1\n\nF2\n\n...\n\nc\n1\n\nslide\n\n...\n...\n\nc\n\nF1\n\n...\n\nc'\n2\n\nC\n\nc'\n1\n\n3\n\nF'2\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nn\nc\n\nc\n2\n\n1\n\nc'\n2\n\nc'\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 2.\n\n~\n=\n\nFigure 3.\nFor i = 1, 2, let Ni be a small regular neighborhood of Gi , such that N1 \u2229 N2 is\nempty. Let \u03b3i = \u03b3 \u2229 Ni , which is a tangle in Ni . Let c \u2282 \u03b3 be the component\nwhich intersects L. Let Li denote the new disk-leaf in Gi , which intersects c. By\nthe induction hypothesis and [8, Theorem 3.17], for i = 1, 2, there is a clasper Fi\nconsisting of finitely many disjoint, simple strict tree claspers of degree deg Gi for\n\u03b3i in Ni , such that\n(3.3)\n\n(\u03b3i )Fi \u223c\n= (\u03b3i )Gi .\n\nFor i = 1, 2, c \u2229 Ni consists of two components ci , c\u2032i , where these components for\ni = 1, 2 placed in c in the order c1 , c2 , c\u20321 , c\u20322 . For each of these arcs c1 , c2 , c\u20321 , c\u20322 ,\nthere are finitely many intersecting disk-leaves and finitely many winding edges, as\ndepicted in the left-hand side of Figure 2. Slide the disk-leaves and edges of F2\naround c2 along c to traverse those of F1 around c\u20321 . The result is depicted in the\nright-hand side of Figure 2. By (3.2) and [8, Propositions 4.4 and 4.6], this sliding\ndoes not change the Cn -equivalence class of result of surgery on \u03b3. Let F2\u2032 \u2282 N2\ndenote the clasper obtained from F2 by the above sliding moves. It follows from the\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nconstruction of G1 and G2 that \u03b3 F1 \u222aF2 \u223c\n= \u03b3 G1 \u222aG2 , where G\u20321 and G\u20322 are depicted\nin Figure 3. By an obvious graph-clasper version of [8, Proposition 3.4], we have\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b3 G1 \u222aG2 \u223c\n= \u03b3. Hence we have\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b3 F1 \u222aF2 \u223c \u03b3 F1 \u222aF2 \u223c\n= \u03b3.\n= \u03b3 G1 \u222aG2 \u223c\n\nCn\n\nThe assertion follows from this, (3.1), and (3.3).\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark.
