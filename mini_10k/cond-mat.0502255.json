The\nwellknown examples are triangular and kagom\u00e9 lattices\nin two dimensions and pyrochlore and face-centered cubic (fcc) lattices in three dimensions. Intriguing behavior of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials\nhave attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical attention in the past decade [1]. Frustrated properties\nof Ising antiferromagnet on an fcc lattice (fig.1) have\nbeen recognized a long-time ago [2]. The case of vector\n(Heisenberg) spins has been investigated to a lesser extent. Experimental realizations of fcc magnets include\ntype-I antiferromagnet UO2 [3, 4] and type-II antiferromagnet MnO [5].\nIn the present work we investigate a nearestneighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an fcc lattice\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian\nX\nSi * Sj ,\n(1)\nH=J\n\n2a\n\nFig.1: Face-centered cubic lattice as a network of edgesharing tetrahedra\n\nThe minimum is reached at Q = (\u03c0/a)(1, q, 0) with arbitrary q and all equivalent wave-vectors in the cubic\nBrillouin zone. This set includes, in particular, the typeI antiferromagnetic structure with Q1 = (\u03c0/a)(1, 0, 0)\nand the type-III ordering with Q3 = (\u03c0/a)(1, 21 , 0). The\ntype-I (type-III) structure becomes the only absolute\nminimum of Jq if a weak second-neighbor exchange is\nadded to Eq. (1) with ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic)\nsign, see, e.g., [6].\nDegeneracy of the nearest-neighbor model (1) is a\nconsequence of decomposition of an fcc lattice into a\nnetwork of edge-sharing tetrahedra, such that every site\nis shared between 8 tetrahedra. The classical ground\nstate constraint consists, then, in a requirement of zero\ntotal spin for every tetrahedron. This yields an infinite\nnumber of collinear and noncollinear state with different periodicity, all of them having the same classical\nenergy. The harmonic spin-wave analysis shows that at\nlow temperatures thermal fluctuations select collinear\nstates by an order by disorder effect [6]. Such a result\ncan be most easily understood by a method suggested\n\nhiji\n\nwhere Si is a classical vector spin of unit length. Every spin interacts with 12 nearest neighbors separated\nby (\u00b1a, \u00b1a, 0), (0, \u00b1a, \u00b1a) and (\u00b1a, 0, \u00b1a). Frustrated\nproperties of the model (1) become apparent if one calculates the mean-field transition temperature TcMF =\n1\n3 | min{Jq }|. The Fourier transform of exchange interaction is\n\u0002\nJq = 4J cos(qx a) cos(qy a) + cos(qy a) cos(qz a)\n\u0003\n+ cos(qz a) cos(qx a) .\n(2)\n1) mike.zhitomirsky@cea.fr\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. V. Gvozdikova, M. E. Zhitomirsky\n\nin Ref. [7], where the effect of short wave-length thermal\nfluctuations is shown to lead to an effective biquadratic\nexchange between neighboring spins. For the classical\nspins on an fcc lattice thermal fluctuations generate the\nfollowing low-temperature correction to the free-energy:\n\u2206F = \u2212\n\nT X\n(Si * Sj )2 .\n32\n\n(3)\n\nhiji\n\nSuch a biquadratic interaction favors collinear spin arrangement. Two examples of collinear ground states\ninclude type-I spin structure Si = \u00ea cos(Q1 * ri ) and\ntype-III configuration Si = \u00ea cos(Q3 * ri + 41 \u03c0). Additional collinear ground states are constructed from\nthe above two configurations by selecting crystal planes\n(parallel to one of the cubic axes) with the N\u00e9el type of\nspin order and rotating all spins in such planes by 180\u25e6 .\nAll obtained collinear states have exactly the same freeenergy in the harmonic approximation due to an extra\ngauge symmetry of a quadratic Hamiltonian [7]. Their\ndegeneracy is lifted by anharmonicities in the spin-wave\nHamiltonian-the problem, which to our knowledge has\nnot been considered analytically.\nFinite temperature transition of a type-I fcc antiferromagnet has been studied by the renormalization group\napproach [8, 9]. Absence of stable fixed points within\nthe \u01eb-expansion suggests a first-order transition driven\nby thermal fluctuations. The above calculations have\nbeen performed for the case when the type-I structure\ncorresponds to the absolute minimum, that is the case\nof the spin model (1) with a significant ferromagnetic\nsecond-neighbor exchange. In the nearest-neighbor case\nthe anomalous contribution of thermal fluctuations is\nfurther enhanced due to extra soft modes. Therefore,\nthe conclusion about a first-order transition should remain essentially unchanged.\nNumerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the finite temperature phase transition in a nearest neighbor\nfcc antiferromagnet have been performed by a standard\nsingle spin-flip technique [10, 11, 12]. First-order nature of the transition at Tc \u2243 0.45J was unambiguously\nestablished from the finite size scaling of the peak in\nthe specific heat [11] and has been further supported\nby the energy histograms collected at the transition\npoint [12]. As for the type of magnetic ordering at\nlow temperatures there is no consensus among different\nauthors. The first works have suggested the collinear\ntype-I antiferromagnetic structure [10, 11], though no\nresults for the magnetic structure factor have been produced. In the subsequent more detailed study [12] the\nlow-temperature phase of an fcc antiferromagnet was\ndescribed as 'a collinear state with glassy behavior.' Ap-\n\nparent difficulty in simulation of an fcc antiferromagnet\nat low temperatures comes from the above mentioned\ndegeneracy between various collinear states, which correspond to different local minima of the free-energy\nfunctional. The collinear states transform into each\nother under rotation of all spins in one crystal plane.\nThe local minima of the free-energy are, therefore, separated by rather large entropy barriers \u223c L2 , L being\na linear size of the system. A single spin-flip MC technique cannot produce appreciable moves in the phase\nspace between distinct collinear configurations. As a\nresult, the spin system hardly relaxes to the absolute\nminimum and the magnetic structure factor does not\nexhibit good averaging in a reasonable computer simulation time.\nIn the present work we shall apply the novel exchange MC method [13] for simulation of a Heisenberg\nfcc antiferromagnet. This modification of the standard\nMC technique, also called parallel tempering [14], has\nbeen developed for spin glasses, which is an outstanding example of hardly relaxing spin systems with numerous local minima separated by macroscopic energy\nbarriers. In the exchange MC technique, several replicas of the spin system are simulated in parallel at a\npreselected set of temperatures. After a few ordinary\nMC steps performed on each replica, adjacent in temperature replicas are exchanged with a specially chosen\nprobability [13]. The ensemble of parallel tempering,\nthus, includes two Markov processes: stochastic motion\nin the multidimensional phase space of the spin model\nand a random walk along a one-dimensional array of\nreplicas. The second auxiliary process helps to dramatically decrease the correlation time for the main stochastic motion by repeatedly heating a given replica to high\ntemperatures, where it quickly looses memory about the\nlow-temperature magnetic structure. The exchange MC\ntechnique allows to equilibrate moderate size systems\nand has gained popularity in simulation of spin glasses\n[15] and frustrated Ising models [16]. This method has\nnot been applied so far to geometrically frustrated vector spin models.\nWe have performed exchange MC simulations of the\nmodel (1) on finite clusters with periodic boundary conditions and N = 4L3 sites for L = 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12\n(N = 256\u20136912). The highest temperature for the exchange MC ensemble was selected at Tup = 0.75J > Tc ,\nwhere the system equilibrates fast with a standard MC\ntechnique. The lowest temperature in our simulations\nwas 0.1J. The intermediate temperatures have been determined empirically starting with a geometric progression in such a way that the exchange rates for replicas\nswaps are roughly uniform and exceed 0.1 for the largest\n\n\f3\n\nFirst-order transition in Heisenberg fcc antiferromagnet\n0.4\nL=4\nL=6\nL=8\nL=10\nL=12\n\n0.4\n2\n<Pcol\n>\n\nS \u03b1\u03b1(Q)\n\nL=4\nL=6\nL=8\nL=10\nL=12\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTemperature [J]\nFig.2: Temperature dependence of the structure factor\ncorresponding to the type-I antiferromagnetic ordering\n\nclusters. In particular, in the vicinity of the first-order\ntransition point the temperature steps have to be decreased in order to avoid a bottleneck for replicas drifts\nacross Tc . In total we have employed NT = 72 replicas\nfor most cluster sizes. The MC procedure for simulation of individual replicas is the multiflipping Metropolis method, see, e.g., [11], which includes several flipping\nattempts (m = 5 in our case) on every spin under the\nsame local field before moving to a next spin. This\nmethod is especially suitable for an fcc lattice with a\nlarge coordination number z = 12, when calculation of\nlocal fields takes a significant part of the CPU time. After sweeping 2 times over the whole cluster, the replica\nexchanges have been performed. The above procedure\nconstitutes one exchange MC step. All replicas were set\nin random initial configurations and equilibrated over\n105 exchange MC steps. Measurements have been performed for additional 5 \u00d7 105 \u20134 \u00d7 106 exchange MC\nsteps. Equilibration of various physical characteristics\nhas been checked (i) by absence of time evolution over\nat least a half of measuring time, and (ii) by comparison to the results for a different set of initial replica\nconfigurations obtained by gradual annealing of a single\nreplica from high temperatures.\nDuring simulations of the exchange MC ensemble\nthe internal energy, the specific heat, the magnetic\nstructure factor, and the collinear order parameter have\nbeen measured. Results for the internal energy and the\nspecific heat are identical with the previous results obtained by the standard MC method [11, 12] and are not\ndiscussed here. The magnetic structure factor is given\nby a square of the antiferromagnetic order parameter:\nS \u03b1\u03b1 (q) =\n\n1 X \u03b1 \u03b1 iq(ri \u2212rj )\nhS S ie\n,\nN 2 i,j i j\n\n(4)\n\nwhere h. . .i denotes a thermal average.

This generally indicates an absence of\nthe corresponding order in the thermodynamic limit at\nany T .\nResults for the structure factor of the type-I antiferromagnetic ordering are presented in fig.2. Contributions from three nonequivalent wave-vectors of the\ntype-I structure are added together. Symbols are used\nto distinguish different curves, while the lines are drawn\nthrough the actual data for NT = 72 replicas. For the\nlargest cluster with N = 6912 spins only NT = 39 replicas down to T = 0.3J have been equilibrated. The\nremarkable feature of the presented data is an inverse\nfinite-size scaling at temperatures below Tc \u2243 0.45J:\nthe order parameter increases with the system size.\nThe equilibrium sublattice magnetization deduced from\nS \u03b1\u03b1 (q) is still significantly smaller than 1 even at\nT = 0.1J. This is a consequence of thermally excited\nstacking faults, domain walls and other defects in an\nideal type-I antiferromagnetic structure. Linear size of\nsuch defects coincides with the lattice size. Their concentration, therefore, decreases with increasing system\nproducing a significant increase of the order parameter. Unfortunately, the lattice sizes are still too small\nto observe an asymptotic thermodynamic behavior for\nS \u03b1\u03b1 (q), though they definitely point at the spin ordering with the wave-vector of the type-I antiferromagnetic\nstructure. The data for two large clusters exhibit a clear\njump at the transition temperature indicating the firstorder transition.\nMeasurements of S \u03b1\u03b1 (q) cannot distinguish between\npresence of three domains of a single-q type-I structure,\nwhich is always the case for finite clusters, and a noncollinear triple-q spin state. In order to study this aspect\nof the magnetic ordering in an fcc antiferromagnet we\ndefine a collinear order parameter. This is a single-site\ncharacteristics, which is insensitive to periodicity (wave-\n\n\f4\n\nM. V. Gvozdikova, M. E.

The collinear\norder parameter is given by a traceless second-rank tensor:\n1 X \u03b1 \u03b2\n1\nP \u03b1\u03b2 =\nhSi Si i \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 .\n(5)\nN i\n3\nIt vanishes for a noncollinear triple-q structure and has\nnonzero value for a collinear state. In the present case\nP \u03b1\u03b2 is a secondary order parameter: it couples linearly\nto a square of the primary antiferromagnetic parameter.\nFor an XY antiferromagnet on a checkerboard lattice,\nP \u03b1\u03b2 is, however, a primary order parameter and characterizes a spin-nematic state [7].\nIn MC simulations, a square of the order parameter\n(5) is measured, which is given by\n2\nPcol\n=\n\n1\n1 X \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2\nhS S S S i \u2212 .\nN 2 i,j i i j j\n3\n\nL=12\nL=14\nL=18\n\nW(S)\n\nW(E)\n\n2\u00d710\n\n(6)\n\n2\nThe corresponding results are shown in fig.3. Since Pcol\nis proportional to the fourth power of an antiferromagnetic order parameter, it does not show an appreciable jump at the first-order transition temperature. The\ndata for the collinear order parameter exhibit a remarkable lack of finite size scaling. This indicates that spins\nover the whole lattice are predominantly parallel or antiparallel to a certain direction. At T = 0.1J the aligned\ncomponent of spin is hS \u03b1 i \u2248 0.78. Thus, the combination of the structure factor results (fig.2) and the\ncollinear order parameter data (fig.3) points uniquely to\nthe collinear type-I antiferromagnetic order in a Heisenberg fcc antiferromagnet.\nFinally, we present results for the energy and the\norder parameter histograms (distribution functions) at\nthe transition point. Since an fcc antiferromagnet ex-\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nS(Q)\nFig.5: Histogram for the magnetic structure factor at\nthe first order transition Tc = 0.4459J\n\nhibits a weak first-order transition, we find it more advantageous to perform histogram collection with a single replica instead of setting up an exchange MC ensemble. Histograms have been collected utilizing a hybrid MC algorithm: 3 multiflipping Metropolis steps\nare combined with 11 overrelaxation (microcanonical)\nupdates [17]. On average 2 \u00d7 106 configurations have\nbeen generated to build one histogram. Its accuracy\nhas been checked by comparing the final distribution\nfunction to intermediate distributions obtained with\nproper rescaling from 106 and 5 \u00d7 105 configurations.\nThe quality of the data shown in fig.4 is significantly\nhigher than in the previous work [12], which allows us\nto locate more precisely the transition point. The firstorder nature of the transition is clearly observed from\na double-peak structure of the energy histogram, see\nfig.4. Positions of the two peaks do not change significantly with growing cluster size, while probability for\nintermediate states rapidly drops with increasing L. At\nTc \u2248 0.4459J, the probability weights in the two peaks\nfor the largest L = 18 cluster (N = 23328) differ by\napproximately 15%. To demonstrate a strong temperature dependence of the relative weight of two peaks we\npresent on the inset of fig.4 the distribution functions\nat T = Tc \u00b1 0.0001J. The system clearly spends more\ntime in the upper (lower) peak above (below) the transition temperature. We conclude, therefore, that the\nfirst-order transition in a Heisenberg fcc antiferromagnet takes place at Tc = 0.4459 \u00b1 0.0001J.\nThe distribution function for a square of the antiferromagnetic order parameter is shown in fig.5. The\nlargest cluster also develops a double-peak structure\ncharacteristic for the first-order transition. Smaller clusters have, however, significantly wider distributions for\nthe magnetic structure factor, which is not surprising in\nview of many local minima for different collinear states.\nIt is interesting to notice that the jump of S \u03b1\u03b1 (Q) at the\ntransition point determined from the histogram for the\n\n\fFirst-order transition in Heisenberg fcc antiferromagnet\nL = 18 cluster (fig.5) is close to the jump observed for\nthe L = 12 cluster in temperature scan (fig.2), though\nthe latter lattice does not exhibit any visible doublepeak structure at Tc . This indicates that apart from a\nclose vicinity of the transition point the L = 12 cluster\nmay be very close to the thermodynamic limit.\nIn conclusion, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations for a finite temperature transition in a nearestneighbor Heisenberg fcc antiferromagnet. The obtained\nresults clearly demonstrate a first-order transition into\na collinear type-I antiferromagnetic structure due to an\n'order by disorder' effect. Entropy mechanism for selection of the magnetic ordering suggests an interesting sequence of phase transitions for a weak antiferromagnetic\nsecond-neighbor exchange 0 < J \u2032 \u226a Tc . The higher\ntemperature transition from a paramagnetic state is determined by thermal fluctuations and takes place into\nthe type-I collinear antiferromagnetic structure. At low\nenough temperatures T \u223c J \u2032 the energy selection overcomes the entropy effect and a second transition from\nthe type-I into the type-III structure occurs.\nWe are grateful to H. G.
