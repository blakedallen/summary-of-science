It is demonstrated\nthat the dependence on unphysical renormalization and factorization scales is strongly reduced beyond the leading order. The sensitivity of the heavy quark spin asymmetry to \u2206g\nis studied, including the limited detector acceptance for experimentally observable leptons\nfrom heavy quark decays at the BNL RHIC. As a further application of our results, gluino\npair production in polarized pp collisions is briefly discussed.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction and Motivation\n\nTriggered by the measurement of the proton's spin-dependent deep-inelastic structure function\ng1p by the EMC [1] more than a decade ago, combined experimental and theoretical efforts\nhave led to an improved understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon. In particular, we\nhave gained some fairly precise information concerning the total quark spin contribution to the\nnucleon spin. The most prominent \"unknown\" is the elusive, yet unmeasured spin-dependent\ngluon density, \u2206g. Hence current and future experiments designed to further unravel the\nspin structure of the nucleon focus strongly on the issue of constraining \u2206g. In particular,\ninformation will soon be gathered for the first time at the BNL Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider\n(RHIC) [2].\nThe main thrust of the RHIC spin program [2] is to hunt down \u2206g by measuring double\nspin asymmetries in longitudinally polarized pp collisions at high energies. RHIC is particularly\nsuited for this task, since the gluon density is expected to participate dominantly in many\ndifferent production processes. This is in contrast to deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering\nwhere the gluon enters only as a small correction in the next-to-leading order (NLO) of QCD\nand indirectly via the renormalization group evolution of the parton densities. Along with the\nproduction of prompt photons and jets with high transverse momentum pT , heavy flavor pair\ncreation is one of the most promising candidates at RHIC to study \u2206g(x, \u03bcF ) over a broad\nrange of the momentum fraction x and scale \u03bcF . By virtue of the factorization theorem [3],\nhelicity densities extracted from different processes should match. This important universality\nproperty, exploited in \"global\" fits of parton densities, can also be tested at RHIC.\nIn the lowest order (LO) in the strong coupling \u03b1s , heavy flavor pair production in hadronhadron collisions proceeds through two parton-parton subprocesses,\nqq \u2192 QQ\n\nand\n\ngg \u2192 QQ .\n\n(1)\n\nGluon-gluon fusion is known to be the by far dominant mechanism for charm and bottom\nproduction in the unpolarized case in all experimentally relevant regions of phase space [4, 5, 6].\nThis feature, true also in the polarized case unless \u2206g is exceedingly small, makes heavy\nquark production a particularly suited tool to study the gluon density. However, NLO QCD\ncorrections to the LO subprocesses in Eq. (1) have to be included for a reliable description. First\nand foremost this is due to the strong dependence of the LO results on unphysical theoretical\nconventions such as the factorization scale, which reflects the amount of arbitrariness in the\nseparation of short- and long-distance physics. In addition, the size of the NLO corrections\nturns out be quite sizable and not uniform in, e.g., the pT of one of the heavy quarks [4, 7].\nThe latter feature rules out the use of any approximations as estimates of the complete NLO\n1\n\n\fcorrections. The computation of the NLO corrections are fairly involved since one has to keep\ntrack of the mass of the heavy quark, m, throughout the calculation. Massless approximations\nare bound to fail at small-to-medium values of pT where m \u2243 O(pT ) and the cross section is\n\nlarge. So far only unpolarized NLO results had been available, see Refs. [4, 7, 5] and [6] for\nthe differential and total cross sections, respectively. Polarized LO expressions can be found in\nRefs. [8, 9], but the complete NLO results are presented for the first time in this work.\nApart from calculational difficulties, a further complication arises when one tries to match\ntheoretical parton-level results for heavy flavor production rates with experimental ones. Experiments can only observe the remains of heavy quark (meson) decays \u2013 usually leptons. In\npractice they also have to impose cuts on these particles to insure a proper c and b quark\n\nseparation and to take care of the, usually limited and non uniform, detector acceptance. One\nthus has to find a practical way to incorporate hadronization, lepton-level cuts, and the detector acceptance in an analysis based on parton-level calculations, since they can distort spin\nasymmetries if polarized and unpolarized cross sections are affected differently. This may lead\nto incorrect conclusions about \u2206g. Heavy flavor decays usually have multi-body kinematics\nmaking it difficult if not impossible to trace back cuts to the parton-level analytically. Instead\nwe propose to use \"efficiencies\", to be defined below, for bins in pT and pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 of\nthe heavy quark, to model its hadronization, decay, and crucial detector features.\nHeavy flavor production at RHIC is also interesting for reasons other than \u2206g. There is a\nwell-known, longstanding discrepancy between data from the Tevatron collider for unpolarized\nopen b production and theory [10]. Recently, b rates in ep and \u03b3\u03b3 collisions were also found to be\nin excess of theoretical predictions [10]. The fact that open c production seems to be fairly well\ndescribed by theory makes these experimental findings even more puzzling, since perturbative\nQCD should be more reliable for the much heavier b quark. This discrepancy for inclusive b\nproduction has revived speculations about new physics. For instance, the parameters of the\nminimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model can be tuned such that relatively light\ngluinos g\u0303 exclusively decay into even lighter (s)bottom quarks b\u0303 and b's: g\u0303 \u2192 bb\u0303 [11]. In this\nway the yield of b's is enhanced, and the Tevatron data can be reproduced while still complying\n\nwith direct supersymmetry searches and precision measurements in e+ e\u2212 collisions [11]. As\nwill be briefly discussed below, our LO and NLO results for the dominant gluon-gluon fusion\nsubprocess also contain the production of gluino pairs, gg \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303, after adjusting the color\n\nfactors appropriately1 [4]. Thus one can also estimate the spin-dependent hadroproduction\n\nof (light) gluinos at RHIC and at a conceivable polarized version of the CERN LHC in the\ndistant future. Other explanations [12] of the observed b excess make use of unintegrated\ngluon distributions and kT -factorization, however, NLO calculations in this framework are still\n1\n\nThe qq \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303 subprocess receives new contributions absent in qq \u2192 QQ.\n\n2\n\n\flacking. If results from the just upgraded Tevatron confirm the b excess, RHIC will play an\nimportant r\u00f4le in deciphering the underlying mechanism since it allows to study the energyand spin-dependence of both c and b production.\nFinally, our results are also required for a fully consistent description of the polarized photoproduction of heavy quark pairs. Apart from the \"direct\" process \u03b3g \u2192 QQ, where the\nNLO corrections have been calculated in Refs. [13, 14], the (quasi-)real photon can also resolve\n\ninto its hadronic content before the hard scattering takes place. The introduction of photonic\nparton densities is mandatory for the factorization of mass singularities of the direct process\nassociated with collinear \u03b3 \u2192 qq, q = u, d, s, splitting. Polarized \"resolved\" photon processes,\n\nEq. (1), have been estimated [15] to be small for fixed target experiments like COMPASS [16],\nbut can be significant at proposed future polarized lepton-hadron colliders like the EIC [17].\nIn this paper we focus on the outline and main results of our calculation. In Section 2 we\ngive a brief description of the calculational steps and methods we have employed, in particular\nof the subtleties which arise due to the spin-dependence. In Section 3 we first discuss the different features of the NLO corrections to the polarized gluon-gluon fusion subprocess, always in\ncomparison to the unpolarized case. Next we demonstrate the significantly reduced dependence\non unphysical renormalization and factorization scales in NLO QCD for heavy flavor production at RHIC. We finish with studying the sensitivity of the heavy quark spin asymmetry to\n\u2206g at RHIC energies including realistic cuts on experimentally observable leptons from heavy\nquark decays. We conclude in Section 4. Technical details and lengthy analytical results are\nomitted throughout and will be presented elsewhere [18] along with further phenomenological\napplications.\n\n2\n\nOutline of the Technical Framework\n\nThe O(\u03b1s3 ) NLO QCD corrections to heavy flavor production comprise of three parts: the one-\n\nloop virtual corrections to the LO processes in Eq. (1), the real \"2 \u2192 3\" corrections to Eq. (1)\n\nwith an additional gluon in the final state, and a new production mechanism, gq(q) \u2192 QQq(q),\nappearing for the first time at the NLO level. We choose the well-established framework of ndimensional regularization, with n = 4+\u03b5, to tame the singularities of the loop- and 2 \u2192 3 phase\nspace integrals. Ultraviolet singularities show up only in the virtual corrections and are removed\n\nby on-shell mass and coupling constant renormalization at a scale \u03bcR . The latter is performed\nin a variant of the MS scheme which is usually adopted for heavy flavor production [5, 6, 7].\nThis prescription is characterized by the decoupling of heavy quark loop contributions to the\ngluon self energy and leads to a fixed flavor scheme with nlf = nf \u2212 1 light flavors active in the\n3\n\n\frunning of \u03b1s and in the scale \u03bcF evolution of the parton densities. Infrared (IR) divergencies\nof the virtual diagrams are cancelled by the soft poles of the 2 \u2192 3 contributions. This includes\n\nalso double, 1/\u03b52 , pole terms which show up when IR and mass/collinear (M) singularities\ncoincide. The left over 1/\u03b5 M singularities are then absorbed into the bare parton densities by\nthe standard factorization procedure in the MS scheme. Other renormalization/factorization\nschemes can be obtained easily by additional finite scheme transformations.\nThe required squared matrix elements |M|2 for both unpolarized and longitudinally polar-\n\nized processes are obtained simultaneously by calculating them for arbitrary helicities \u03bb1,2 =\"\u00b1\"\nof the incoming quarks or gluons, i.e.,\n2\n\n|M|2 (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) = |M| + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u2206|M|2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nusing the standard helicity projection operators for bosons and fermions (see, e.g., Ref. [19]).\n2\n\nResults obtained for the unpolarized |M| can be compared to the literature [4, 5, 6, 7] which\nserves as an important consistency check for the correctness of our new helicity dependent\n\nresults \u2206|M|2 . To facilitate this comparison we closely follow the calculational steps and\nmethods adopted in [4, 7]. It should be noted that, contrary to the unpolarized case [7], the\nprocesses qq \u2192 QQg and gq \u2192 QQq are not related by crossing for polarized initial states and\n\nhave to be calculated separately. We should also recall here the definition of the spin-dependent\nparton densities,\n\u2206f (x, \u03bcF ) \u2261 f++ (x, \u03bcF ) \u2212 f\u2212+ (x, \u03bcF )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere f++ (f\u2212+ ) denotes the probability to find a parton f = q, q, g at a scale \u03bcF with momentum\nfraction x and helicity + (\u2212) in a proton with helicity + [the unpolarized parton densities\n\nf (x, \u03bcF ) are obtained by taking the sum in (3)]. In the following the compact notation \u03c6\u0303\ndenotes both an unpolarized quantity \u03c6 and its longitudinally polarized analogue \u2206\u03c6.\nThe virtual (V) cross section for the qq and gg initial states is obtained up to O(\u03b1s3 ) only from\n\nthe interference between the virtual and Born amplitudes. Loop momenta in the numerator are\ndealt with by applying an adapted version of the Passarino-Veltman reduction program to scalar\nintegrals [20], which properly accounts for all possible n-dimensionally regulated divergencies\nin QCD. The required scalar integrals can be found in [4], however, we have checked them\nby standard Feynman parameterization techniques (see also [21]).

The color factors are expressed in terms of\nthe Casimir operators CF = (NC2 \u2212 1)/2NC and CA = NC , where NC denotes the number of\n4\n\n\fcolors. The lengthy expressions for \u00d1i and \u0168i in Eqs. (4) and (5) can be found in [18]. For the\ngg process we have a slightly different way of splitting up the results according to color than\nRef. [4]. The choice in Eq. (5) ensures that the \"Abelian\" \u0168QED is identical to the QED part of\n\u03b3g \u2192 QQ in Ref. [13] after taking into account the usual factor 1/(2NC ) for replacing a photon\nby a gluon. Furthermore, compared to Ref. [4] an additional function \u0168RF appears in Eq. (5)\nsince we are interested in the general case \u03bcR 6= \u03bcF . Our unpolarized results fully agree with\n\nthe corresponding expressions in [4, 7] except for UQL in Eq. (6.22) of Ref. [4] which contains\na numerically irrelevant misprint2 .\nThe real 2 \u2192 3 gluon bremsstrahlung corrections (R) can be split up in a similar way\n\naccording to color structure and read\n|M\u0303gg |2R = g 6 \u1ebc\u03b52\n\n1\n2(NC2 \u2212 1)\n\nh\ni\n(2CF )2 D\u0303QED + CA2 D\u0303OQ + D\u0303KQ ,\n\n(6)\n\nand accordingly for the qq and gq processes [18]. In order to isolate the divergencies of (6)\nappearing in the soft limit, which cancel the remaining singularities of the virtual matrix elements, we \"slice\" the 2 \u2192 3 result into a \"soft\" (S) and a \"hard\" (H) gluon part by introducing\n\na small auxiliary quantity \u2206 [4, 7]. The kinematics of the soft gluon cross section is effectively\n\nthat of a 2 \u2192 2 process, and all phase space integrations can be performed easily. Upon combi-\n\nnation with the virtual cross section the 1/\u03b5 IR and 1/\u03b52 IR+M singularities, all proportional\n\nto the n-dimensional Born cross section, drop out. Thus the \"soft+virtual\" (S+V) cross section\nbecomes finite, except for 1/\u03b5 M singularities that cancel against \"soft\" x = 1 contributions,\nsee Eq. (8), in the mass factorization procedure discussed below. Phase space integrations for\nthe hard part are more subtle and require some care. As in [4, 7] we are interested in the double\ndifferential single inclusive cross section for the production of a heavy quark (or antiquark).\nFor stable numerical simulations later on it is advantageous to perform the integrations over\nthe phase space of the two not observed partons analytically as far as possible. To achieve\nthis requires extensive partial fractioning to reduce all phase space integrals to a standard form\n[4, 13, 21]. A sufficient set of four- and n-dimensional integrals are again conveniently collected\nin [4], but we have recalculated and confirmed this set. Analytical results for the S+V cross\nsections will be given in [18]; the final expressions for the hard part are too lengthy but can be\nfound in our computer code.\nTo obtain a finite result, all remaining M singularities have to be removed by the standard\nmass factorization procedure which makes use of the fact that any collinear singular partonic\ncross section d\u03c3\u0303ijM can be schematically written as\nZ 1\nZ 1\nM\n \u0303 lm (x1 k1 , x2 k2 ) ,\nd\u03c3\u0303ij (k1 , k2 ) =\ndx1\ndx2 \u0393\u0303li (x1 , \u03bcF /\u03bc) \u0393\u0303mj (x2 , \u03bcF /\u03bc) d\u03c3\u0302\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\nWe thank J.

Here d\u03c3\u0302\ncross section, \u03bc is the scale introduced to render the coupling g dimensionless in n dimensions,\nand the transition functions \u0393ij are given up to NLO by\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n2\n\u03bc2F\n\u03b1s\n(0)\n \u0303\nP\u0303 (x)\n+ \u03b3E \u2212 ln 4\u03c0 + ln 2 + \u03beij (x)\n\u0393\u0303ij (x, \u03bcF /\u03bc) = \u03b4ij \u03b4(1 \u2212 x) +\n2\u03c0 ij\n\u03b5\n\u03bc\n\n(8)\n\n(0)\n\nwith P\u0303ij the LO splitting functions. Therefore all M singularities, Eq. (7), can be absorbed universally into the bare parton densities upon calculating physical, i.e., hadron-level, observables.\nThe choice of the factorization scale \u03bcF and the arbitrary functions \u03be \u0303ij reflects the amount of\narbitrariness in the separation of short-distance and long-distance physics. In the MS scheme,\nwhich we choose, one has \u03be \u0303ij = 0.\nTwo subtleties, which show up in n-dimensionally regulated spin-dependent calculations beyond the LO of QCD, have to be mentioned here. First and foremost, the projection operators\nonto certain helicity states, i.e., \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 and \u03b35 , are of purely four dimensional nature, and there\nexists no straightforward and unique generalization to n 6= 4 dimensions. We treat them by\n\napplying the internally consistent HVBM prescription [22], where the Levi-Civita \u01eb-tensor continues to be a genuinely four-dimensional object. \u03b35 is defined as in four dimensions, implying\n{\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b35 } = 0 for \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3 and [\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b35] = 0 otherwise. The price to pay are (n \u2212 4) dimensional scalar products, usually denoted by kd\n* p (\"hat momenta\") appearing alongside the usual\n\nn-dimensional scalar products. In our case only a single hat momenta combination p\u03022 = \u2212pd\n*p\nappears in the polarized 2 \u2192 3 cross section and can be accounted for by an appropriately mod-\n\nified phase space formula [13]. These contributions are inherently of O(\u03b5) and only contribute\n\nto the final result when they pick up a 1/\u03b5 pole. Secondly, the unphysical helicity violation at\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nthe qqg vertex in the HVBM scheme, which is reflected by Pqq 6= \u2206Pqq in n dimensions, has\n\nto be undone by an additional finite renormalization [23] \u2206\u03beqq = \u22124CF (1 \u2212 x) in Eq. (8) in the\nconventional MS scheme. Only then d\u2206\u03c3\u0302qq = \u2212d\u03c3\u0302qq is obtained, the result which is expected\ndue to helicity conservation.\n\n3\n\nNumerical Results and Phenomenological Aspects\n\nBefore presenting results for hadronic heavy flavor distributions we first discuss the total par \u0303 ij , i, j = q, q, g.

Hence the \u03c3\u0302\n(1)\nthe main features of the NLO corrections in the most transparent way. The f \u0303 are non-trivial\nij\n\nfunctions of \u03b7 and can be easily obtained from our double differential analytical results for the\npartonic cross sections by numerical integrations. In the unpolarized case they have been cast\ninto a compact semi-analytical form [6] for fast numerical calculations of the total hadronic\n(1)\nheavy flavor cross section which is a desirable future project in the polarized case. The f \u0303 \u0304 can\nij\n\nbe derived just from mass factorization, since terms proportional to\n\nln \u03bc2F\n\noriginate only from\n\nEq. (8). The last term in Eq. (9) vanishes for the standard choice \u03bc\u0010F = \u03bcR . In NLO\n\u0011 this term\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03b20\nfollows straightforwardly from the LO result by replacing \u03b1s \u2192 \u03b1s 1 + \u03b1s 4\u03c0\nln \u03bc2R thanks to\nF\n\nthe renormalization group invariance of the cross section.\n\n \u0303 gg in LO and NLO for\nIn Fig. 1 we present the gluon-gluon subprocess cross section (m2 /\u03b1s2 )\u03c3\u0302\n\u03bcF = \u03bcR = m as a function of \u03b7 in the MS scheme. The threshold for QQ production, s = 4m2 ,\nis located at \u03b7 = 0. It turns out that the NLO corrections are significant in the entire \u03b7 range.\nAt threshold the polarized and unpolarized cross sections are equal, thus Eq. (2) implies that\n \u0303 gg approaches zero at threshold, it tends\n|Mgg |2 (+\u2212) \u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2192 0.

It should be noted that in the threshold region logarithms from\nsoft gluon emissions also contribute significantly even at the lowest \u03b7 shown. In the high\nenergy domain, \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, our polarized and unpolarized results behave rather differently. Here\nFeynman diagrams with a gluon exchange in the t-channel drive the unpolarized NLO result\n\nto a plateau value [4] whereas the polarized NLO cross section vanishes like the LO one, i.e.,\n|Mgg |2 (++) \u2192 |Mgg |2 (+\u2212) in Eq. (2) as \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e. Similar observations have been made in the\nphotoproduction case \u03b3g \u2192 QQ [13]. The scaling function f \u0303qq fulfils \u2206fqq = \u2212fqq after taking\ninto account the additional finite factorization mentioned above to restore helicity conservation\n\nat the qqg vertex. The behaviour of fqq was discussed in [7] and shall not be repeated here. The\ngenuine NLO scaling function f \u0303gq is numerically much smaller than f \u0303gg and can be found in\n[18] but exhibits the same high-energy \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e behaviour as f \u0303gg , i.e., fgq approaches a plateau\nwhile \u2206fgq vanishes.\n\nThe physical, i.e., experimentally observable, total cross section is obtained by convoluting\nthe partonic cross sections in Eq. (9) with the appropriate flux of parton densities evolved to\nthe scale \u03bcF ,\n2\n\n\u03c3\u0303(S, m , \u03bcF , \u03bcR ) =\n\nXZ\nij\n\n1\n4m2\nS\n\ndx1\n\nZ\n\n1\n4m2\nx1 S\n\n \u0303 ij (s, m2 , \u03bcF , \u03bcR ) ,\ndx2 f \u0303i (x1 , \u03bcF ) f \u0303j (x2 , \u03bcF ) \u03c3\u0302\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S is the available hadron-hadron c.m.s. energy and s = x1 x2 S. In a similar fashion\ndifferential heavy (anti-)quark inclusive distributions like d2 \u03c3\u0303/dpT dpL can be derived by convolution with our double differential partonic cross sections. It also should be kept in mind\nthat beyond the LO of QCD, parton densities and partonic cross sections have to be taken in\nthe same factorization scheme in order to guarantee that Eq. (10) is independent of unphysical\ntheoretical conventions up to the order in \u03b1s considered in the calculation.\nOne of the main motivations of performing the NLO calculations was to reduce the dependence on the choice of \u03bcF and \u03bcR which is completely arbitrary in LO and can lead to sizable\nambiguities in predictions for \u03c3\u0303(S, m2 ) and the corresponding spin asymmetry to be defined\nbelow. In Fig. 2 we demonstrate that the NLO results for the polarized charm production cross\nsection are indeed more robust under scale variations than LO estimates. In the left panel of\nFig. 2 we vary \u03bcF and \u03bcR independently of each other in the range \u03bc2R = R m2 and \u03bc2F = F m2\n\u221a\nwith 1 \u2264 R, F \u2264 4.5 for fixed m = 1.4 GeV at a typical RHIC energy of S = 200 GeV using\n\nthe GRSV \"standard\" set of polarized parton densities [24]. In the right part of Fig. 2 we em-\n\nploy the conventional choice \u03bcR \u2261 \u03bcF and vary \u03bcF and m = C GeV in a typical range for the\n\ncharm pole mass. In order to better visualize the uncertainties due to scale and mass variations\nwe show \u2206\u03c3(R, F, C)/\u2206\u03c3(R = 2.5, F = 2.5, C = 1.4) \u2212 1, i.e., the deviation in percent of the\ntotal polarized charm production cross section according to Eq.

Corresponding contour lines in steps of 20% are given at the base of each plot.\nwith respect to a reference cross section taken at fixed \u03bc2F = \u03bc2R = 2.5m2 with m = 1.4 GeV.\nTo better guide the eye, contour lines in steps of 20% are plotted at the base of each plot. Here\nwe also indicate the common choice \u03bcR = \u03bcF and m = 1.4 GeV (thin solid lines) in the left and\nright part, respectively.\nThe NLO result in the left part of Fig. 2 is considerably \"flatter\" than the LO result\nwith respect to variations of \u03bcF but shows, however, slightly more variation with \u03bcR . Not\nunexpectedly and more importantly it turns out that the usual choice \u03bcR = \u03bcF almost coincides\nwith the contour line of zero deviation from the reference cross section in NLO, in stark contrast\nto the situation at LO. This leads to the improved stability of the NLO prediction in the\nright panel of Fig. 2 for variations of a common scale \u03bcF \u2261 \u03bcR at a given charm mass m.\n\nHere variations of the charm mass cause the major uncertainty of about \u00b130% in the NLO\n\npredictions. In LO we find considerable uncertainty stemming from variations of \u03bcF on top of\n9\n\n\fthat. It should be also noted that qualitatively similar results are obtained for\n\n\u221a\n\nS = 500 GeV\n\nand bottom production at RHIC. Usually in NLO the terms proportional to ln \u03bc2F /m2 and\nln \u03bc2R /\u03bc2F in Eq. (9) start to have a compensating effect for different choices for \u03bcF and \u03bcR and\nalso provide some guidance that \u03bcf \u223c O(m) and \u03bcF \u223c \u03bcR in order to avoid large logarithms in\n\nthe hard partonic cross sections. Ultimately one expects the dependence on \u03bcF and \u03bcR to be\nreduced more and more if higher and higher orders in \u03b1s are considered. However, as was briefly\nexplained above in connection with Fig. 1, in the reaction studied here new types of Feynman\ndiagram topologies enter the calculation for the first time at the NLO level, whereas in next-toNLO (NNLO) and beyond no qualitatively different diagrams appear. Hence in a sense NLO is\nthe first \"complete\", non-trivial order of perturbation theory for heavy flavor production, and\nit is pleasing that scale stability improvements nevertheless clearly set in without considering\nNNLO corrections which seem unattainable at this time.\nInstead of measuring polarized cross sections like \u2206\u03c3(S, m2 ) directly, experiments will usually study the related longitudinal spin asymmetry defined by\nA(S, m2 ) \u2261\n\n\u2206\u03c3(S, m2 )\n\u03c3(S, m2 )\n\n(11)\n\nin case of the total cross section and accordingly for differential heavy quark distributions. The\nexperimental advantage of this quantity is that one does not need to determine the absolute\nnormalization of the cross section \u2206\u03c3\u0303(S, m2 ) which is usually difficult to obtain. However, one\nshould keep in mind that the situation in the unpolarized case is far from clear, in particular concerning bottom, and hence it would be reasonable to determine the unpolarized and\npolarized cross section separately. We note that for small variations of the scales the relative\ndeviation of the asymmetry can be written as\nof \u03bcF , \u03bcR , and m considered above that\n\n\u03b4\u2206\u03c3\n\u2206\u03c3\n\n\u03b4A\nA\n\nand\n\n=\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n\u03b4\u2206\u03c3\n\u2206\u03c3\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n.\n\u03c3\n\nIt turns out for the variations\n\nare almost equal in NLO, whereas they\n\ncan differ strongly in LO. As a result it is even more true for the asymmetry that NLO results\nare highly stable, whereas the LO uncertainty is huge, in particular for the choice \u03bcR \u2261 \u03bcF .\nWe will explore this in detail in [18], but wish to point out here that LO determinations of \u2206g\n\nusing the asymmetry alone will necessarily have a prohibitively large theoretical error, a NLO\nanalysis is a must in that case.\nFinally, let us turn to the important question of whether heavy flavor production at RHIC\ncan be used to discriminate between different polarized gluon densities. To address this question thoroughly one has to take into account an estimate of the statistical significance of a\nmeasurement of a heavy quark spin asymmetry at RHIC. Compared to direct photons or jets\nwhich are directly observed in the detector this is a rather involved problem for heavy flavors.\nWith the PHENIX detector at RHIC charm and bottom quarks can be identified only through\ntheir decay products, preferably leptons. However, the electron and muon detection is rather\n10\n\n\flimited in pseudo-rapidity, |\u03b7e | \u2264 0.35 and 1.2 \u2264 |\u03b7\u03bc | \u2264 2.4, respectively, and cuts in the lepton\n\npT have to be imposed in order to separate charm and bottom. Since heavy flavor decays usually\n\nhave a multi-body kinematics and may proceed through cascades, cuts on the observed leptons\nare difficult to translate back to the calculated parton, i.e., heavy quark, level. One possibility\nis to rely on Monte Carlo simulations of heavy quark decays, for instance, on PYTHIA [25],\nwhich are quite successful and tuned to a wealth of data. PYTHIA can be used to generate\n\"efficiencies\" \u03b5eff for observing a heavy quark within a certain bin in pT and \u03b7 in the detectors at\nRHIC. If properly normalized to the total number of heavy quarks generated in that particular\nbin, \u03b5eff should become independent of all the details of the heavy quark production mechanism\nassumed in PYTHIA. This is essential for an unbiased extraction of \u2206g.\nExploiting this idea, a first numerical study for the PHENIX detector has been performed3 .\nThe resulting efficiency \u03b5eff (pT , \u03b7) for a charm quark produced with transverse momentum pT\nand pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 to be detected via its decay electron anywhere in the PHENIX acceptance,\nwith the electron trigger allowing peT > 1 GeV, is approximately given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22129.79 + 4.58(pT /GeV)1.88\ne\nwith\n\u03b5eff (pT , \u03b7; pT > 1 GeV) = \u03b6 exp\n(pT /GeV)1.73 + 1.74 \u03b6 \u22120.79\n\u001b\n\u001a\n0.42\n\u0002\n]\n0.43 \u0003\u0001 5.84 exp[\u2212(pT /2.48 GeV)\n.\n\u03b6 = exp \u2212 \u03b7/ 4.06 exp \u2212 (pT /1.05 GeV)\n\n(12)\n\nA prediction for the charm cross section as measurable with PHENIX is then obtained by\nconvoluting our double differential partonic results with \u03b5eff in Eq.

In the future [18] we plan to use a set of efficiencies with several different cuts on, or\nbins in, peT to generate different \u03c3\u0303eff . For the time being, different cuts in peT are simulated by\n\nlimiting the charm transverse momentum pT instead, while still using Eq.

Also\nshown is an estimate for the statistical error using a luminosity of L = 320 pb\u22121 (see text).\nin [24, 26, 27, 28, 29]. For consistency, m is also taken as in these fits, i.e., m = 1.4 GeV for the\nmodern and m = 1.5 GeV for the old spin-dependent densities. All results are obtained for the\nchoice \u03bc2F = \u03bc2R = 2.5(m2 + p2T ). It is immediately apparent from Fig. 3 that charm production\nat RHIC can be very useful in pinning down \u2206g. The estimated statistical error for such a\nmeasurement, \u03b4A =\n\n1 \u221a 1\n,\nPp2 L\u03c3eff\n\nassuming a luminosity of L = 320 pb\u22121 and a beam polarization\n\nof Pp \u2243 0.7 [2] is significantly smaller than the total spread of the predictions. This is true in\n\nparticular if we take the large GS A [29] \u2206g into account, which is still compatible with recent\n\ndata. The GS A asymmetry is so large that it had to be scaled down by 0.7 to fit well into the\nsame plot. Note that very small gluons, e.g., the oscillating \u2206g of GS C [29], are at the edge\nof being detectable. There are three groups of helicity densities which will be indistinguishable\nwithin the errors by charm production: GRSV'00 std. & DS i-, AAC 1 & 2, and DS iii+ &\nGRSV'96 std. & val. Here the gluon densities are too similar in the range of x predominantly\nprobed by this process. We will map the range in x where \u2206g is accessible by heavy flavor\nproduction at RHIC in detail in [18].\n12\n\n\f0.8\nGRSV'00 val.\nGRSV'00 std.\nAAC 1\nAAC 2\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nDS iDS iii+\n\u03c3(LO)/\u03c3(NLO): GRV'98\n\nA(NLO)/A(LO)\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n\nmin max\nxmin\nT =pT /pT\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 4: Ratio of the asymmetries in NLO and LO, A(NLO)/A(LO), with A(NLO) as shown in\nFig. 3. The ratio of unpolarized cross sections \u03c3(LO)/\u03c3(NLO) used in the calculation of A is also\nshown for comparison (thin solid line).\nFinally we take a look at the importance of the NLO corrections for the heavy flavor spin\nasymmetry. Fig. 4 shows the ratio of the charm spin asymmetries calculated in NLO (as shown\nin Fig. 3) and LO for the range of modern helicity densities [24, 26, 27]. One can infer that\nthe NLO asymmetries are generally smaller than the LO ones by a factor of about three. In\nthe case of the AAC helicity densities [26] we find an even larger suppression. Furthermore,\nthere is considerable dependence on xmin\nT , which will inhibit the use of constant \"K-factors\"\nto estimate the NLO results from LO ones. It should also be pointed out that much of the\nreduction of the asymmetry in NLO stems from the unpolarized cross section in NLO, which\nis about a factor two larger than the corresponding LO result. This is shown by the thin solid\nline in Fig. 4 representing the ratio \u03c3(LO)/\u03c3(NLO) obtained with the GRV'98 parton densities\n[31]. The sizable difference of the asymmetry predictions in LO and NLO means that the LO\nand NLO gluon helicity densities extracted from a future asymmetry measurement will differ\nconsiderably. Whether this will be consistent with data from other processes has to studied in\na global analysis, e.g., along the lines suggested in Ref. [30].\n\n13\n\n\fFurther studies of the uncertainties and predictions for bottom production will become available soon [18]. There we will also present more details concerning the calculational techniques\nthat have been used and analytical results for the matrix elements that we have obtained.\nIn case one wants to extend our gluon-gluon results to the production of gluinos, one has to\ntake into account the following colorfactor replacements in Eqs. (5) and (6), which already\ninclude the color-average: replace the prefactor\n\n1\n2 \u22121)\n2(NC\n\n\u2192\n\nNC\n2 \u22121\nNC\n\nand set CF = CA = NC inside\n\nthe square brackets. Before doing the latter, one has to use the identity 1 = CA2 \u2212 2CF CA\n\nfor the KQ parts, e.g., \u0168KQ = (CA2 \u2212 2CF CA )\u0168KQ \u2192 \u2212NC2 \u0168KQ . We note that one could\nuse this identity anyway to rewrite the results with the same number of colorfactors, e.g.,\n\nCA2 \u0168OQ + \u0168KQ = CA2 (\u0168OQ + \u0168KQ ) \u2212 2CF CA \u0168KQ , but this has numerical disadvantages due to\nthe length of the expressions for \u0168OQ and \u0168KQ . For a complete NLO supersymmetric QCD\n\ncalculation of spin-dependent gluino production one would have to take into account that the\nrunning of the strong coupling will be changed and that other subprocesses will contribute.\nHowever, as always, gluon-gluon scattering is expected to be the dominant subprocess.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarize, we have presented the first complete NLO QCD calculation for the spindependent hadroproduction of heavy quarks. The NLO results have considerably less uncertainties stemming from variations of the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales.\nThey even become nearly independent of the scales when the conventional choice \u03bcF = \u03bcR is\nemployed. There remains, however, an uncertainty of \u2206\u03c3 of about \u00b130% from variations of the\n\ncharm mass within a reasonable range. We have made predictions for the charm asymmetry\nthat can be measured soon with the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. These predictions include\nan efficiency function which describes hadronization, decays of the heavy quarks, experimen-\n\ntal cuts, and the detector geometry. In this way it was demonstrated clearly that \u2206g can be\nconstrained considerably with heavy flavor production, even if current experimental limitations\nare taken into account realistically. Finally, we have shown that as in the unpolarized case,\nLO calculations cannot be substituted in any simple manner for the full NLO result. Our\nwork is of particular relevance also to the \"heavy quark enigma\" arising from discrepancies of\nunpolarized bottom, but not charm, production data with theory. On the one hand one now\nwill be able to compare spin-dependent RHIC data for charm and bottom production to a NLO\nprediction. On the other hand our calculation provides the major part of the spin-dependence\nof a possible \"new physics\" explanation of this discrepancy in terms of supersymmetry by a\nsimple adjustment of colorfactors. More details and further phenomenological studies can be\nfound in [18].\n14\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to M. Grosse Perdekamp and J. Smith for helpful discussions.
