Golub\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0609436v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 21 Nov 2006\n\nDepartment of Physics,\nBen-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel\nWe examine the impact of Coulomb electron-electron interaction on transport in a junction with\na quantum dot described by Kondo Hamiltonian. We analyze the Fermi liquid regime and consider\nthe limit of zero temperature. With the help of Keldysh technique we calculate the non-linear current and shot noise as a function of applied voltage. We show that Coulomb interaction markable\ninfluences the universal effective charge of current-carrying particles e\u2217 = 5/3e which can be measured in shot-noise experiments. The electron-electron interaction modifies this universal value by\na factor (e\u2217 = 5/3eF ) which is less then one and also voltage dependent.\nPACS numbers: 72.10.Fk, 72.15.Qm, 73.63.Kv\n\nThe non-linear conductance and zero-frequency noise\nout of equilibrium (shot noise) can yield information on\ncharge fluctuations in physical systems [1]. Indeed, in\nmany cases the effective charge of carriers may be different from bare electron charge e. This occurs when\nthe fundamental quasiparticle charge does not coincide\nwith e or due to interactions. The Kondo effect in the\nquantum dots opens the opportunity to investigate the\nchanging of effective charge due to interactions. For this\npurpose it is of a special interest the Fermi liquid regime\nof Kondo model. In this case the backscattering current\nis defined by the scattering term and by the interaction\nquadratic in the spin current. The measurements of the\nbackscattering current and shot noise can give the information about effective backscattering charge of the\ncarriers influenced by interactions. These reasons have\nbeen put forward in a recent work [1] where the effective current-carrying charge of the particles was found to\nacquire the universal value e\u2217 /e = 5/3. However, as we\nwill show in the present article, the Coulomb interaction\nand corresponding electrical potential fluctuations have a\nnoticeable impact on this effective charge. They change\nthe value of backscattering charge and cause a voltage\ndependence of e\u2217 . To obtain the effective charge with\nor without electrical potential fluctuations we have to\nfind both parts (scattering and interaction) of the current\nand shot noise [1, 2, 3]. We concentrate in the following\non T = 0 limit, where the thermal noise vanishes. We\nconsider the regime around the strongly interacting fix\npoint (Fermi liquid regime) of Kondo Hamiltonian, that\nis, eV << TK (TK is the Kondo temperature) counting\nfor potential fluctuation at the one loop approximation.\nHere we notice that the role of Coulomb interaction in\nthe case of a large dots was analyzed before in a number\nof articles [4, 5, 6].\nOur principal result can be written compactly as\ne\u2217 /e = 35 F , where factor F depends on the bias voltage,\ncharging energy EC = e2 /C (here C is the total capacitance), and the effective number of conducting channels\nN\u0304 . In Fig.1 we plot this factor as a function of voltage\n\nF\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.7\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\neV\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n0.1 \u00e3C\n\nFIG. 1: Voltage dependence (in units of Coulomb energy EC )\nof factor F. The curves are related to different number of effective conducting channels N\u0304 starting from N\u0304 =2 up to N\u0304 =10\n\nfor different N\u0304 . For validity of perturbation theory that\nwe use, the absolute value of the voltage must be not too\nsmall. Also for dot systems EC >> TK . In this limit we\nhave\nF =\n\n1 + an\n1 + aj\n\n2EC N\u0304\n4\n(ln(\n+ 0.36)\n\u03c0eV\n5N\u0304\n2EC N\u0304\n7\n+ 0.16)\n(ln(\n=\n\u03c0eV\n4N\u0304\n\n(1)\n\nan =\n\n(2)\n\naj\n\n(3)\n\nIn the region of small voltages factor F (Fig1.) rather\nstrongly ( 30%) reduces the effective charge. Now we\npresent the basic steps which lead to the derivation of\nequation (1).\nEffective action: Coulomb interaction in a quantum\ndot is responsible for formation of Kondo effect and for\nelectric potential fluctuations in the whole junction. The\nKondo effect depends also on the tunnelling rates between the dot and the leads. The later strongly influence\nthe Kondo temperature TK . The Coulomb interaction is\ncharacterized by the charging energy EC . The parameter\nthat controls the impact of electron electron interactions\n\n\f2\non the tunnelling is the total conductance g or the number of open channels N . More precisely, in the case of\nlarge N we can find the interaction corrections by performing 1/N expansion. Here we address the unitary\nlimit of Kondo quantum dot with odd numbers of electrons in it, that is, we deal with ordinary Kondo effect\nin a quantum dot. Though, in this case N = 2 (effective N may be increased by a shunting resistance) we\nbelieve that even at 1/N level the qualitative picture is\ncorrect. The problem is also interesting because of its\nrelation to a rare case of a non-equilibrium system with\ninteraction where the electrical potential fluctuations are\nincluded. As an advantage of the unitary limit is that\nthe effective transmissions are close to the unity. Indeed,\nconductance in additions to \u03c30 = 2e2 /h has a small non2\nlinear contribution \u03c3V \u223c \u2212V 2 /TK\n, where the bias voltage V << TK . As we will show the Coulomb interaction\nmodifies only the nonlinear part of the transport current\nand shot noise. Therefore, to the lowest order in V /TK\none can calculate the effective action for electric potentials taking in considerations only the unitary limit. In\nthis limit we can use two approaches which give the same\nresult for spin 1/2 Kondo model: one is based on scattering representation of the Kondo Hamiltonian [8], the\nother is the mean field slave boson approximation (SB)\n[9]. The SB is more transparent and it will be used to\nobtain the effective action. We start with the Anderson\nHamiltonian\nX\n\u0124 = HL + HR +\n(v\u03b1 c\u2020\u03b1\u03c3,k d\u03c3 + H.c.)\nk,\u03c3,\u03b1\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u01ebd\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3\n\n+ U d\u2020\u2191 d\u2191 d\u2020\u2193 d\u2193\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c3\n\nThe first two terms correspond to non-interacting electrons in the two leads\nX\nHL(R) =\n\u03beL(R)k c\u2020L(R)\u03c3,k cL(R)\u03c3,k\n(5)\nk,\u03c3\n\nwhere c\u03b1\u03c3,k , \u03be\u03b1k are the electron field operator and the\nelectron energy of a lead. Index \u03b1 = L, R indicates left\n(right) lead. We assume that the leads are biased by\nthe fluctuating electric field potential drop v(t) = d\u03c6(t)\ndt .\nThere are also electron electron interactions in the leads\nwhich are not included in the Hubbard coupling U . At\nfirst we separate the Hubbard interaction that leads to\nKondo effect. For this we apply to Hamiltonian (4) the\nSB approximation at U \u2192 \u221e. In the slave-boson approach, the localized electron operator d\u2020\u03c3 is represented\nby f\u02c6\u03c3\u2020 b\u0302 with b\u0302 and f\u02c6\u03c3\u2020 being, respectively, the standard boson and fermion operators. The action on Keldysh contour then will incorporate the Anderson Hamiltonian (4)\nwith the new boson and fermion operators. The quadric\nterm is replaced by the two new terms: one represents\nthe renormalized level position in the dot \u01eb\u0303, and the second stands for requirement of a single occupancy which\n\ndemands a Lagrange multiplier \u03bb\nX\nb\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 +\nf\u02c6\u03c3\u2020 f\u02c6\u03c3 = 1\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c3\n\nIn the SB approximation the Bose operators b\u0302\u2020 , b\u0302 are replaced by their expectation value b. Having the Anderson\npart of the action arranged we can get the general form\nof the total effective action by including the Coulomb\ninteraction term. Performing the standard HubbardStratonovich decoupling of this term in the action, one\nintroduces on the Keldysh contour fluctuating electrical\ni (t)\n, (i = 1, 2) [4, 10]. Next we inpotentials vi (t) = d\u03c6dt\ntegrate out the fermion operators in the leads, and also\nadd the action of external circuit expressed in terms of\nshunt resistance Rs . Thus the effective action acquires\na form Sef f = Sb + S + Ss , where nonoperator bosonic\npart of the action is\nZ\nSb = \u2212 \u03bbi (b2i \u2212 1)\u03c3zii\n(7)\nwhere \u03c3z is the Pauli matrix. The action S consists of two\nparts: the one describing the scattering of electron in the\nleads, and the other (SHS ) responsible for the fluctuating\nHabbard-Stratonovich fields\nS = \u2212iT rLnG\u22121 + SHS\n(8)\n2\n\u0393b\n\u2202\n\u03c3z (g\u0303L + g\u0303R )]\u03c3z\n(9)\nG\u22121 (t, t\u2032 ) = [i \u2212 \u01eb\u0303 \u2212\n\u2202t\n2\u03c0\n\u2032\ng\u0303L,R (t, t\u2032 ) = e\u00b1i\u03c6\u0302(t) gL,R (t \u2212 t\u2032 )e\u2213i\u03c6\u0302(t ) ,\n(10)\nZ\nC\n \u0307\n \u0307 z \u03c6\u0302)\nSHS =\n(11)\ndt(tr\u03c6\u0302\u03c3\n2e2\nZ Z\n1 i\ndtdt\u2032 \u03c7(t)\u03b3(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03c7(t\u2032 )\nSs = 2 [\ne Rs 2\nZ\n+\ndt\u03c7(t)(eV \u2212 (\u03c6\u03071 + \u03c6\u03072 )/2)]\n(12)\nhere \u0393 is a tunnelling width, \u03c7 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 , the Fourier\ntransform of \u03b3(t) at finite temperature T is \u03b3(\u03c9) =\n\u03c9coth(\u03c9/2T ). Here and below the values with the hat\nv\u0302, \u03c6\u0302 mean the diagonal 2 \u00d7 2 matrices with entries v1 , v2\nand \u03c61 , \u03c62 , respectively. gL,R represent Keldysh matrices\nof the electron propagators in the leads at the position of\nthe dot. Their Fourier transforms are known: g r = \u2212i\u03c0,\ng 12 (\u01eb) = 2i\u03c0f (\u01eb) with f (\u01eb) as Fermi distribution function. All dependencies on constant bias and fluctuating\npotentials are collected in the exponents of Eq.(10). We\nalso define Tk = \u0393b2 as an effective Kondo temperature.\nThe G(\u03c9) includes the Lagrange multiplier which shifts\nthe localized level position \u01eb to \u01eb\u0303 = \u01eb+\u03bb. For our purpose\nit is enough to find both free parameters, Tk and renormalized level \u01eb\u0303, by solving two self-consistent equations\nin equilibrium (neglecting the fluctuations of electrical\npotential) [9].

The calculations are straightforward, though, rather long. The results for the unitary\nlimit are in accordance with those obtained by bosonization technique [6, 11, 12, 13] and in reference [4].

For this purpose we use the basis of s and p scattering states rather\nthan those of the left-lead and right-lead states. At\nV = 0 the p states are decoupled from the dot. For nonzero fluctuating potentials the p-states are not decoupled,\nhowever, the s, p basis is important. In real junctions\nwith strong Kondo effect, nearly T = 0 the dot is described by strongly interacting fix-point with many body\nstate (b\u0304). Before scattering the phases of both states, b\u0304\nand s -state, coincide, while passing the scattering region\nb\u0304 state acquires only an extra phase \u03c0 compared to that\nof s-state. Then the fix-point Hamiltonian can be written\n[8, 14, 15] in the new basis (b\u03c3,k , a\u03c3,k ) (here a\u03c3,k stands\nfor p-states) as H = H0 + Hs + Hint\nX\nH0 =\n\u03bek (b\u2020\u03c3,k b\u03c3,k + a\u2020\u03c3,k a\u03c3,k )\nk,\u03c3\n\nvX \u2020\n(b\u03c3,k a\u03c3,k + a\u2020\u03c3,k b\u03c3,k )\n+\n2\nk,\u03c3\n\nHs = \u2212\n\na X\n(\u03bek + \u03bek\u2032 )b\u2020\u03c3,k b\u03c3,k\u2032\n\u03bdTK \u2032\n\n(17)\n\nk,k ,\u03c3\n\nHint =\n\nb\nb\u2020 b\u2191 b\u2020 b\u2193\n\u03bd 2 TK \u2191 \u2193\n\n(18)\n\nP\nwhere b = 2a and a = 1/(2\u03c0) [14] and b\u2191 = k b\u2191,k .

To\nobtain the Coulomb interaction corrections to conductance and shot noise we have to express the current in\nterms of Green functions (the inverse of (20) and then,\nwith help of effective action (15), to average the product\nof fluctuating potentials. This goal can be achieved by\napplying the perturbation theory (it corresponds to 1/N\nexpansion).\nCurrent: To begin with, we consider, at first, the average current.

We address\nthe important problem of effective backscattering charge\nfor current-carrying particles in the interacting systems.\nThis charge can be obtained from the measurements of\nshot noise and backscattering current in the Fermi liquid\nregime of a Kondo quantum dot. We show that in this\nregime the potential fluctuations can markable reduce\nthe recently calculated universal value 5/3e [1], though,\nthe effective charge remains bigger then e. To get our\nprincipal result we have calculated the transport current\nand obtained the zero frequency shot noise power. Of\ncause, the potential fluctuations are not the only cause\nto change the effective charge. The pure unitary limit\nin real system may by broken by the symmetry breaking interactions like potential scattering or magnetic field\nwhich can also influence the effective charge. However,\nin the case these effects are small, they can be properly\nestimated [1, 3, 14, 15] and render a small correction to\ne\u2217 .\nI would like to thank A. D. Mirlin and A.
