Fourier, B.P. 53, F-38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France\nPreprint online version: August 22, 2016\nABSTRACT\n\u25e6\nContext. The puzzling detection of Ca ii ions at fairly high latitude (>\n\u223c 30 ) above the outer parts of the \u03b2 Pictoris circumstellar disk was\nrecently reported. Surprisingly, this detection does not extend to Na i atoms, in contradiction with our modelling of the emission lines in and\nout of the mid-plane of the disk.\nAims. We propose that the presence of these off-plane Ca ii ions (and to a lesser extent Fe i atoms), and the non-detection of off-plane Na i\natoms, could be the consequence of the evaporation process of Falling Evaporating Bodies (FEBs), i.e., star-grazing planetesimals that\nevaporate in the immediate vicinity of the star.\nMethods. Our model is two-fold. Firstly, we show numerically and theoretically that in the star-grazing regime, the FEBs are subject to\ninclination oscillations up to 30 \u2013 40\u25e6 , and that most metallic species released during each FEB sublimation keep track of their initial orbital\ninclination while starting a free expansion away from the star, blown out by a strong radiation pressure. Secondly, the off-plane Ca ii and Fe i\nspecies must be stopped prior to their detection at rest with respect to the star, about 100 AU away. We revisit the role of energetic collisional\nprocesses, and we investigate the possible influence of magnetic interactions.\nResults. This dynamical process of inclination oscillations explains the presence of off-plane Ca ii (and Fe i). It also accounts for the absence\nof Na i because once released by the FEBs, these atoms are quickly photoionized and no longer undergo any significant radiation pressure.\nOur numerical simulations demonstrate that the deceleration of metallic ions can be achieved very efficiently if the ions encounter a dilute\nneutral gaseous medium. The required H i column density is reduced to \u223c 1017 cm\u22122 , one order of magnitude below present detection limits.\nWe also investigate the possibility that the ions are slowed down magnetically. While the sole action of a magnetic field of the order of 1 \u03bcG is\nnot effective, the combined effect of magnetic and collisional deceleration processes lead to an additional lowering of the required H i column\ndensity by one order of magnitude.\n\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe dusty and gaseous disk surrounding the young mainsequence star \u03b2 Pictoris has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery (Smith & Terrile 1984). The\nmain motivation for these studies is that this disk constitutes\nthe most convincing example of a probable young extrasolar\nplanetary system, possibly analogous to the early solar system. \u03b2 Pic is a young star, but it is not a pre-main sequence\nstar. Its age has been subject to controversy in past years,\nbut successive determinations based on the kinematics of the\nsocalled \u03b2 Pictoris moving group (Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s et al.\n1999; Zuckerman et al. 2001; Ortega et al. 2004) lead to a most\nrecent estimate of 11.2 Myr (Ortega et al. 2004). This shows\nthat its disk should be called a young planetary rather than\nSend offprint requests to: H. Beust\nCorrespondence to: Herve.Beust@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr\n\na protoplanetary disk, meaning that planet formation already\nshould have had enough time to occur. Indeed, although no\ndirect planet detection has been made so far, several indirect\nobservational facts suggest that planets are present in the disk.\nThis mainly concerns asymmetries found in the disk images\nfrom both scattered stellar light by the dust (Kalas & Jewitt\n1995; Heap et al. 2000) and thermal emission by the dust\n(Weinberger et al. 2003), that have been modelled as resulting\nfrom the gravitational perturbations by one Jupiter-sized planet\n(Mouillet et al. 1997; Heap et al. 2000; Augereau et al. 2001).\nThe gaseous counterpart of the dust disk was detected\nin absorption in the stellar spectrum (Hobbs et al. 1985), and\nhas been regularly observed since that time. Observations\nof many metallic species such as Na i, Ca ii, Fe ii. . . have\nbeen reported (Vidal-Madjar et al. 1994), extending more recently to more fragile species like CO (Jolly et al. 1998;\nLecavelier des Etangs et al. 2001).\n\n\f2\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nThe gas was first detected at rest with respect to the star, but\nDoppler-shifted, highly time-variable components are regularly\nobserved in the spectral lines of many elements (Ferlet et. al.\n1987; Lagrange et al. 1996; Petterson & Tobin 1999). These\ntransient spectral events have been successfully modelled as\nresulting from the sublimation of numerous star-grazing planetesimals (several hundred per year) in the immediate vicinity\nof the star (see Beust et al. 1998, 1996, and refs. therein). This\nscenario has been termed the Falling Evaporating Bodies scenario (FEBs).\nFrom a dynamical point of view, the origin of these numerous star-grazers seem to be related to mean-motion resonances (mainly 4:1 and 3:1) with a Jovian planet orbiting the star on a moderately eccentric orbit (e\u2032 \u2243 0.07\u2013\n0.1) (Beust & Morbidelli 1996, 2000). In this context though,\nthe suspected resonance reservoirs are expected to clear out\nvery quickly. In Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001), it was shown that\ncollisions among the population of the planetesimals constituting the disk could help replenish the resonances from\nadjacent regions and subsequently sustain the FEB activity.\nHowever, there are still unsolved questions concerning this scenario. The main one concerns the amount of material available (Th\u00e9bault et al. 2003). There is a large discrepancy between the number of planetesimals deduced from the FEB\nmodel and that deduced from an extrapolation of the dust observed population up to kilometre-sized bodies. We nevertheless note in Th\u00e9bault et al. (2003) that the mass determination\nof Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001) from the FEB scenario is very imprecise as it is indirect. Indeed if the collisions are supplemented by some more violent transport processes, then the\nplanetesimals population required to sustain the FEB activity\ncould be much lower.\nAn important outcome of this model is that it implies an\nimportant reservoir of planetesimals in the disk and the presence of at least one giant planet at \u223c 10 AU from the star. This\nis another argument in favour of the presence of planets in the\n\u03b2 Pic disk. Moreover, the presence of numerous planetesimals\nis also a requirement of the dust models. Due to an intense radiation pressure, many dust particles should be quickly removed\nfrom the system. The particles observed consist of second generation material continuously replenished from inside the disk\nby planetesimals, either by slow evaporation (Lecavelier et al.\n1996) or by collisions (Artymowicz 1997). This justifies the\nname second generation or debris disks given to the \u03b2 Pic\ndisk and other similar disks, such as the HD 141569 disk (see\nAugereau & Papaloizou 2004, and refs. therein).\nRadiation pressure affects not only dust particles, but also\nthe metallic species seen in absorption with respect to the star.\nMany of them undergo a radiation force from the star that\nlargely overcomes the stellar gravity (Lagrange et al. 1998).\nThis is for instance the case of Ca ii for which the radiation\npressure is 35 times larger than the stellar gravity. This seems\nin contradiction with the detection of circumstellar gas at rest\nwith respect to the star. Lagrange et al. (1998) suggested that\nthis stable gas was produced from inside by the FEBs themselves, that it is then blown away by the radiation pressure, and\nafterwards slowed down by a dense enough H i ring where it accumulates. The exact shape of this ring is of little importance,\n\nthe main parameter being the integrated H i column density, of\nthe order of 1018 cm\u22122 . Detailed modelling shows that all stable\ncircumstellar lines can be reproduced this way.\nIn a recent paper, Brandeker et al. (2004, hereafter B04) report the detection with VLT/UVES of emission lines of metals\n(Fe i, Na i, Ca ii) in the \u03b2 Pic disk, i.e., away from the direction of the star. They report the detection of Na i and Fe i up to\nmore than 300 AU from the star. Na i was resolved earlier by\nOlofsson et al. (2001), but the detection of B04 extends further\nout. H2 was also claimed to be detected in emission by Thi et al.\n(2001), implying huge quantities (\u223c 50 M\u2295 ) in the \u03b2Pic system,\nbut this was questioned by Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2001),\nwho reported from FUSE/LYMAN observations an upper limit\n18\n\u22122\nN(H2 ) <\n\u223c 10 cm for the H2 column density towards \u03b2 Pic.\n\nA particularly puzzling outcome of the B04 observations is\nthe detection of Ca ii emission at fairly high latitude above the\nmid-plane of the disk. Ca ii is detected at 77 AU height above\nand below the mid-plane at 116 AU from the star. This corresponds to an inclination of 33\u25e6 above the mid-plane. At this\ndistance, Ca ii is detected in both branches of the disk and on\nboth sides of the mid-plane, and the emission at 33\u25e6 inclination\nlargely overcomes that in the mid-plane. Surprisingly, the Fe i\nand Na i emission do not exhibit such a structuring. It is conversely concentrated in the mid-plane of the disk. However, the\nFe i emission is broader than the Na i. At the height above the\nmid-plane corresponding to the peak emission in the Ca ii lines,\nthe Fe i is still detected. The gas shares the same radial velocity\nas the star within 1 or 2 km s\u22121 at most.\n\nThere is no straightforward explanation for the presence\nof species like Ca ii at such latitudes above the disk, nor for\nthe absence of other species. The purpose of this paper is to\npropose that this gas could constitute material released by the\nFEBs in the vicinity of the star, first blown away by radiation\npressure, and then stopped far away from the star by friction\nwith some gaseous medium, and/or by magnetic interaction.\nThe Ca ii and possibly the Fe i reach a significant inclination\nbecause the parent bodies (the FEBs) initially orbiting within\nthe plane of the disk undergo inclination oscillations up so several tens of degrees when they reach the star-grazer state. Once\nreleased by the FEBs, the ions keep track of that inclination.\nIn Sect. 2, we model the formation of the emission lines in and\nout of the mid-plane of the disk. We show that all the emissions\nare compatible with solar relative abundances between the elements under consideration, except that sodium should necessarily not be present (or strongly depleted) in the high latitude\ngas. In Sect. 3, we expose the dynamical model for high latitude gas generation, and we detail the theoretical background\nfor inclination oscillations in the FEB state. We show that due\nto a negligible radiation pressure on Na ii, sodium should not\nbe present in this gas, in agreement with the observations.\nIn Sect. 4, we investigate how the Ca ii ions could be slowed\ndown at the stellar distance they are observed. We show that\nthis deceleration can be achieved by collision with a dilute neutral medium, and we discuss the role of elastic and inelastic\ncollisional processes. We also discuss the effect of a non-radial\nmagnetic field. While the magnetic field in itself is inefficient\nto decelerate the ions, we show that its presence increases the\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nTable 1.

Modelling the emission lines\nOur first task is to model the emission lines of Ca ii, Na i and\nFe i observed in and out of the mid-plane of the disk, as observed by B04. We focus on the Ca ii K and H lines, the Na i\nD1 and D2 lines, and the Fe i \u03bb = 3859 \u00c5 line. The modelling is\ndone using the radiative transfer code Cloudy by Ferland et al.\n(1998).\nWe take the synthetic Atlas9 (Kurucz 1991) stellar model\nfor \u03b2 Pic with T eff = 8100 K, log g = 4.207 and a total luminosity of 8.7 L\u2299. We put gas at 116 AU from the star and compute\nthe line emission. The chemical composition of the gas is assumed to be solar. The gas is modelled as a 10 AU wide layer\nwith solar composition and a given hydrogen density.\nWithout any additional energy source other than the stellar\nradiation flux, the emission in all lines as computed by Cloudy\nappears negligible, because the gas remains very cold (a few\nKelvins). Thus, in order to generate detectable lines, the gas\nmust be heated by some energy source. There can be some turbulence, but in the framework of our model, the strong deceleration of the weak flux of incoming metallic ions might constitute a sufficient heating source. In the following we thus assume the emission lines to be excited thermally. The incoming\nions, once blown away by the radiation pressure, reach a velocity of \u223c 103 km s\u22121 at 100 AU. The various surveys of the FEB\nactivity towards \u03b2 Pic (Beust et al. 1996) led to estimate that\none roughly 1 kilometer-sized body is destroyed in front of the\nline of sight every day, with temporal fluctuations around one\norder of magnitude. Assuming that not all FEBs cross the line\nof sight, we estimate the total number of FEBs evaporated as\nN =\u223c 10 per day. Taking kilometer-sized bodies with an average density of 2 g cm\u22123 , assuming that half of their mass is\nmade of metallic ions that are pushed away by radiation pressure, and assuming that the ions spread over an open cone of\n\u03b1 =\u223c 30\u25e6 half-opening angle (in order to disperse ions at that\n\n3\n\nlatitude), we may estimate the incoming kinetic energy flux F\nat 100 AU as\nF=\n\n1 Nmv2\n\u223c 0.2 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n2 4\u03c0d2 sin \u03b1\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v \u2243 1000 km s\u22121 is the velocity of the incoming ions and\nm is the average mass of the FEBs. This kinetic energy heats\nthe local H i gas over a distance corresponding to the stopping\npath of the metallic ions. This depends on the density of the\nlocal gas, but we see in Sect. 4 that an H i column density of\n\u223c 1017 cm\u22122 is expected to be sufficient to stop the ions over a\ndistance of a few AU.\nWe thus decided to perform runs of Cloudy with an extra\nheating source, with a volume-heating rate (parameter hextra)\ncorresponding to the incoming kinetic energy flux deposited\nover the stopping distance. We performed several runs for hydrogen densities ranging between 106 and 1010 cm\u22123 . The result listed in Table 1 are for 107 cm\u22123 . For other values, the\nabsolute values of the emissions changes, but their relative behaviour remains comparable.\nIn almost all runs the same line behaviour is reported\n(Table 1): The Ca ii K and H emissions are comparable, the\nCa ii K emission being slightly stronger; the Na i D2 emission\nis typically twice as strong as the Ca ii K one, while the Fe ii\nemission is as strong as the Na i one. There is only little variation between the \"hot\" and \"cool\" cases.\nThis simulation is intended to hold for the gas out of\nthe disk mid-plane. The spectrum of \u03b2 Pic as seen from\nEarth is known to present stable circumstellar components\n(Lagrange et al. 1998) due to the gaseous counterpart of the\ndisk. These componenents appear as sharp (\u223c 0.1 \u00c5 wide) additional absorptions at the bottom of the rotationally broadened\nphotospheric stellar lines.\nThere is a major difference between ions located in and out\nof the mid-plane of the disk : the former ones see a stellar\nspectrum with these circumstellar components, while the latter ones see a stellar spectrum without these components (because they view the star across the disk, as Earth observers).\nThe Atlas9 stellar model does not take into account these circumstellar absorptions. Hence we must add them to the model.\nUnfortunately, adding additional spectral absorptions to the\nstellar models provided is not a standard procedure for Cloudy.\nIt is thus not possible to accurately model the emission in the\nmid-plane of the disk. A first order approximation in order to\ntake these absorptions into account is to apply reduction factors of the stellar flux to ions in the mid-plane of the disk (and\nonly to them). These factors are defined as the ratio of the stellar flux at the bottom of the circumstellar additional absorptions (if present) to the flux at the bottom of the corresponding\nphotospheric lines (or equivalently the top of the circumstellar\nlines). They are simply measured from observed \u03b2 Pic spectra.\nWe used ESO/HARPS spectra communicated by F. Galland.\nThe factors are listed in Table 1. We note that the circumstellar\nlines are particularly deep for the Ca ii lines.\nIn order to derive a rough estimate of the line emissions, we\nmay assume that the emission is proportional to the incoming\nflux. This only applies if the lines are optically thin, but the ratio\nof 2 between the Na i D2 and D1 emission shows that this is the\n\n\f4\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\ncase here. We apply the circumstellar factors of Table 1 to the\nemission intensities derived from Cloudy with no circumstellar absorptions. The ratio between Na i and Fe i emissions remains unchanged (thanks to similar circumstellar factors), but\nthe Ca ii emissions (in both lines) appears now far weaker (a\nfew hundredth in relative intensity) than the Na i and Fe i ones.\nThe observational constrains to fulfill (B04) are the following: In the mid-plane, the Ca ii emission is small compared to\nthe Na i and Fe i ones; the Na i D2 to Na i D1 ratio is close to 2,\nshowing that the emission is optically thin; the emission in the\nFe i \u03bb = 3859 \u00c5 line is comparable to that in the Na i D2 line.\nOut of the mid-plane, the Ca ii emission dominates, but the Fe i\nline may still be detected, because the wing of the line is much\nlarger than for the Na i lines; the Ca ii K to Ca ii H ratio is close\nto one.\nOur simple model succeeds in reproducing the emissions\nin the mid-plane. Out of the mid-plane though, the Na i emission is always stronger than the Ca ii one and comparable to the\nFe i one. It is thus impossible to simultaneously have a strong\nCa ii emission, a Fe i emission a few times weaker, and an undetectable Na i emission. The only possibility is to exclude the\nhypothesis of solar composition.\nWe come therefore to the following conclusions : 1) for the\nemission in the mid-plane, the observations can be reproduced\nassuming solar relative abundances between iron, sodium and\ncalcium; 2) out of the mid-plane, the Fe i and Ca ii line intensities can be consistently simulated assuming solar relative abundances; 3) the non-detection of Na i emission out of the midplane cannot be explained in these conditions, unless sodium is\nstrongly depleted with respect to solar abundance. The model\npresented in next Section provides a plausible explanation for\nsuch sodium depletion.\n\n3. Falling Evaporating Bodies and high latitude\nions\n\n3.1. General features\nWe propose an origin for the high latitude ions observed by\nB04. Two facts need to be explained: i) Why are there large\namounts of gas at 30\u25e6 above the mid-plane of the disk ? ii)\nWhy does sodium seem not to be present in this gas ? We propose that this high latitude gas could be produced by the Falling\nEvaporating Bodies (FEBs).\nThe FEBs are star-grazing bodies that fully evaporate in the\nvicinity of the star. Dynamically speaking, they are planetesimals that have been extracted from the disk orbiting the star and\ndriven to high eccentricity orbits. They enter the FEB regime\nwhen their periastron reaches a threshold value (\u223c 0.4 AU) that\nallows the refractory material to evaporate. The details of the\nevaporation process of the bodies as their periastron decreases\ndown to a few stellar radii are described in Karmann et al.\n(2003). The bodies start to evaporate at each periastron passage, and their evaporation rate increases as the periastron distance gets smaller. For the sizes considered (\u223c 10 km), the\nFEBs are fully evaporated when they reach a periastron value\nq \u2243 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 AU.\n\nStar-grazers may be produced from a disk of planetesimals\nby planetary perturbations. The most efficient mechanism is\nthe Kozai resonance (Kozai 1962), which concerns bodies that\nhave initial high inclination with respect to the orbital plane of\nthe planetary system. Under secular perturbations, the initially\nhighly inclined body is periodically driven to low inclination,\nbut very eccentric, star-grazing orbits. This mechanism is responsible for most of the sun-grazing bodies reported in the\nSolar System, such as the Kreutz group (Bailey et al. 1992).\nHowever, the Kozai resonance is due to the secular, circular part of the interaction Hamiltonian with the planet(s). It is\ntherefore invariant with respect to any rotation in the planet's\norbital plane. Bodies driven by the Kozai mechanism are thus\nexpected to reach the FEB state with random orbit orientations.\nThis does not match the statistics of the Doppler velocities of\nthe variable spectral events observed, which shows a strong\nbias towards redshifts. Most of the suspected FEBs share some\nkind of common preferred periastron orientation range which\nis not compatible with the Kozai resonance (Beust et al. 1996).\nBeust & Morbidelli (1996) proposed that the FEBs could\nbe generated by another mechanism involving mean-motion\nresonances with at least one major perturbing planet. The secular motion of bodies trapped in a given mean-motion resonance\nwith a planet is usually characterised by coupled oscillations\nof the semi-major axis and the eccentricity around a median\nvalue, but if the planet's orbit is slightly eccentric, these oscillations are superimposed on a long-term drift of the eccentricity that can in some cases bring it to star-grazing values.\nYoshikawa (1989) showed that these changes are particularly\nimportant for resonances 4:1, 3:1 and 5:2. Beust & Morbidelli\n(1996) showed that the 4:1 resonance is a potential source of\nFEBs via this mechanism, and in Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001), it\nwas shown that the 3:1 may also contribute to the FEB phenomenon. The planet's eccentricity e\u2032 does not need to be\n\u2032\nvery high; e\u2032 >\n\u223c 0.05 is enough, e = 0.07 or 0.1 being typical convenient values. Such eccentricity values are regularly\nreached by Jupiter due to its secular evolution. This mechanism is close to the one that gave birth to the Kirkwood\ngaps in the asteroid belt, even if in the latter case, the overlapping of mean-motion resonances with secular resonances\nconsiderably enhances the mechanism (Morbidelli & Moons\n1993; Moons & Morbidelli 1995; Morbidelli & Moons 1995;\nFarinella et al. 1994). We cannot exclude this enhancement as\nbeing effective in the \u03b2 Pic system (this would imply the presence of more than one planet), but there is no way to constrain\nit. We are perhaps witnessing in the \u03b2 Pic system a process\nsimilar to what occurred in the Solar System, as it was of comparable age to \u03b2 Pic\u015b current age.\nDue to this mean-motion resonance mechanism, a given\nbody, initially orbiting the star in 3:1 or 4:1 mean-motion resonance with a Jupiter-sized planet, may reach the FEB state\nwithin \u223c 104 orbital periods of the planet. Contrary to the\nKozai case, the periastron longitudes of the FEBs at high\neccentricity are now constrained by that of the perturbing\nplanet, and share some common orientation in closer agreement with the observations. This scenario was numerically\ntested over a large number of particles (Beust & Morbidelli\n2000; Th\u00e9bault & Beust 2001), using the popular symplectic\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nFig. 1. Temporal evolution of the eccentricity (top) and of the\ninclination (bottom) of a typical particle trapped in 4:1 resonance with a planet orbiting \u03b2 Pic at 10 AU with eccentricity\ne\u2032 = 0.07. The planet's mass is 1/1000 of that of the star. The\ninitial eccentricity of the particle is 0.05 and its initial inclination is 2\u25e6 .\nintegration package SWIFT MVS (Wisdom & Holman 1991;\nLevison & Duncan 1994). It was shown that the suspected\nmechanism was able to fairly well match the statistics of the\nobserved FEB velocities, provided the orbit of the perturbing\nplanet adopts a given longitude of periastron with respect to the\nline of sight. If the disk of planetesimals holds a large enough\npopulation of bodies, collisions may help refill the resonance\nand sustain the FEB activity (Th\u00e9bault & Beust 2001).\nThe orbits of the FEB progenitors in the mean-motion resonances are supposed to be roughly coplanar with the plane of\nthe disk. In the simulations of Beust & Morbidelli (2000) and\nTh\u00e9bault & Beust (2001), the initial inclinations of the particles\nwith respect to the orbit of the perturbing planet were initially\nchosen as less than 5\u25e6 and 3\u25e6 respectively, in order to mimic\nthe typical distribution within a cold planetesimal disk. During\ntheir evolution within the resonance, as long as their eccentricity grows, the inclination of the particles remains small, but as\nthey reach the FEB state close to e \u2243 1, their inclination is subject to oscillations of larger amplitude, up to several tens of degrees. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the secular evolution of the eccentricity and of the inclination of a typical par-\n\n5\n\nticle trapped in 4:1 resonance with a planet orbiting \u03b2 Pic. The\nparticle starts at eccentricity e = 0.05 and evolves towards the\nFEB state at e \u2243 1 (the peak eccentricity is about 0.998), and\nthen starts a decrease of its eccentricity. Of course the decrease\nphase is purely fictitious, as a real FEB would be destroyed\nby the successive periastron passages at peak eccentricity. The\ninclination, initially set at 2\u25e6 , remains small for \u2243 105 yr and\nthen starts oscillations that brings it far above the initial value,\nup to 40\u25e6 . This oscillation regime stops after \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 105 yr;\nit corresponds to the high eccentricity phase, when e >\n\u223c 0.85.\nHence the FEBs may remain within the disk during most of\ntheir secular evolution, but finish in the FEB state with inclinations that might bring them significantly out of the disk. The\nFEB themselves do not have excursions far out of the plane\nof the disk, because, as we will see below, when their inclination is high, their argument of periastron \u03c9 is close to 0\u25e6 or\n180\u25e6 . This causes the major axis of their orbit to lie roughly in\nthe plane of the disk at the time the inclination is high. As the\norbit is very eccentric, the vertical excursion of the particle is\nlimited. This is why this effect, present in the simulations of\nBeust & Morbidelli (2000) and Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001), does\nnot have much influence on the visibility of the FEBs (they\nneed to cross the line of sight to be detected in absorption).\nWhat is true for the parent body is not necessary true for\nits byproducts. The metallic ions released by the FEBs such as\nCa ii start to expand radially around the nucleus and stay for\na while in a surrounding cloud that enables the FEB to be detected in absorption when it crosses the line of sight; but they\nare quickly expelled from there by the intense radiation pressure they suffer and then start a free expansion out of the system. This process is extensively described in dedicated simulations in Beust et al. (1990, 1996, 1998). Dynamically speaking,\nthe ratio of the radiation pressure to stellar gravity is a constant\n(usually noted \u03b2) for a given ion or dust grain. This is equivalent to the view that with radiation pressure, the ion feels the\ngravity of star as if its mass was multiplied by 1 \u2212 \u03b2. For Ca ii,\n\u03b2 > 1 (\u03b2 = 35), so that the ions feel a negative mass and are\nstrongly repelled by the star. They nevertheless follow a purely\nKeplerian orbit, namely a hyperbolic repulsive one, similar to\nthe relative motion of two charged particles with charges of the\nsame sign. This orbit is very different to that of the parent body.\nBoth orbits share however the same orbital plane. Indeed, the\nejection velocity of the material escaped from the FEB (typically \u223c 1 km s\u22121 ; see refs. in Beust et al. 1996) is very small\ncompared to the orbital velocity of the FEB itself at a few stellar radii from the star (typically several hundreds of km s\u22121 ).\nThe Ca ii ions may thus be considered with reasonable accuracy to have the same orbital velocity at ejection time as their\nparent body. Both Keplerian orbits are very different because\nof radiation pressure, but they share roughly the same orbital\nplane. In particular, the Ca ii ions keep memory of the orbital\ninclination of their parent body at ejection time, even if this inclination is large thanks to inclination oscillations in the FEB\nstate. But contrary to the parent body, the orbit of Ca ii ions are\nnot confined close to the plane. As explained above, the argument of periastron \u03c9 of the parent bodies is close to 0 or 180\u25e6 in\nthe high inclination state; this forces the FEB to remain close to\nthe mid-plane of the disk. Due to radiation pressure, the shape\n\n\f6\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nof the Ca ii ions is very different from that of their parent body,\nand their argument of periastron is not constrained in the same\nway. If they have a high initial inclination, they may evolve\nfar off the plane of the disk as they escape from the system.\nIf some dense medium is present at a given distance to brake\nthem, they may be detected as an extended emission significantly above the plane such as in the B04 observation. Their\ndetection of Ca ii at 33\u25e6 off the mid-plane could then well correspond to ions that have been produced close to the star by\nFEBs with similar inclination, and that have freely escaped up\nto 100 AU before being stopped there.\nThen, why should this process only concern Ca ii and not\nthe other species detected in emission by B04 ? Iron and\nsodium are byproducts of dust sublimation in FEBs like calcium. Contrary to Ca ii, Na i and Fe i are quickly photoionized\nby the star in the FEB environment. Fe ii (like Fe i) still undergoes a radiation pressure that overcomes the stellar gravity (Lagrange et al. 1998), so that iron is expected to behave\nlike calcium. However, unless the electronic density is high, as\nis the case in the vicinity of the mid-plane disk, iron remains\npredominantly in the Fe ii state whose spectral lines were not\nsearched for by B04. Conversely, Na ii does not feel any noticeable radiation pressure, so that once produced, the Na ii ions\nkeep following the original orbit of the FEB. They may afterwards diffuse slowly in the mid-plane of the disk, but they are\nnot subject to a quick off-plane ejection like the other species.\nIn this context, we thus expect the gas expelled off-plane by this\nprocess to contain calcium and iron with solar relative abundances, but no sodium. This matches our analysis of the emission lines.\nIn the following we detail the theoretical background of the\norigin of the inclination oscillations of the FEBs in high eccentricity regime, and we show examples from the simulations\nfrom Beust & Morbidelli (2000) and Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001).\n\n3.2. Three-dimensional motion in mean-motion\nresonance\nThe theoretical background for the FEB dynamics in meanmotion resonance is described in Beust & Morbidelli (1996),\nbut restricted to the planar case. Here we wish to extend it\nto three-dimensional motion. We describe the restricted threebody problem, i.e., a problem where a mass-less test particle\norbiting a star is perturbed by a planet orbiting the star on an\nunperturbed Keplerian orbit.\nThe full analytical analysis is presented in Appendix A.\nWe assume that the particle is locked in a (p + q) : p meanmotion resonance with the planet. The resonant motion is\nusually described by the \"critical angle of the resonance\" \u03c3\n(Moons & Morbidelli 1995), with\n\u03c3=\n\np+q \u2032 p\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\u031f\nq\nq\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the mean longitude of the particle along its orbit; \u03bb\u2032\nis the same for the planet; \u031f is the longitude of periastron.\nNon-resonant orbits are characterised by a more or less regular circulation of \u03c3, while resonant orbits exhibit libration\n\nof \u03c3 around a stable position. If the planet's orbit is circular, then the following quantity is a secular constant of motion\n(Morbidelli & Moons 1993; Moons & Morbidelli 1995) :\n!\np\np+q \u221a\n2\n\u2212 1 \u2212 e cos i\nN = (1 \u2212 \u03bc)a\n,\n(3)\np\n\nwhere e is the eccentricity, i is the inclination, and \u03bc is the mass\nparameter, i.e. the ratio of the planet's mass to the total mass.\nThe inclination oscillations are controlled by this parameter. If\nthe planet's orbit is not circular, then strictly speaking N is no\nlonger constant, but as the planet's eccentricity e\u2032 is moderate,\nits variation is slow.\nConsidering the circular problem is equivalent to expanding the Hamiltonian H in powers of e\u2032 , and retaining only the\nleading term. The leading (circular) term is responsible for the\n\u03c3-libration, but also for the inclination oscillations at high eccentricity. The higher order terms in e\u2032 cause a slow drift of the\nN parameter. This drift can drive the particle to high eccentricity, even in the planar problem; this is the way the FEBs are\ngenerated.\nFinally, the dynamics of the particle is characterised by\nthree time-scales : a first, small one related to the \u03c3-libration;\na second, larger one characterising the inclination oscillations;\na third, long one describing the secular eccentricity changes\nfrom \u223c 0 to \u223c 1. The second time-scale is larger than the first\none, but significantly smaller than the third one. Hence during\none inclination oscillation, the value of N may be considered\nas \u223c constant, which is equivalent to considering the circular\nproblem.\nIn the circular problem, the secular Hamiltonian H depends\nonly on the inclination i and on the argument of periastron \u03c9,\nonce the value of N is fixed. It is possible to explore the dynamics just drawing level curves of H in (\u03c9, i) plane, exactly\nas done in Beust & Morbidelli (1996). This is done in Fig. 2 for\nthe 4:1 resonance, for 4 different values of N. Instead of giving\nthe value of N, we give a value for the eccentricity and compute the value of N that gives this eccentricity value for i = 0.\nThe value of \u03bc was fixed to 0.001 as typical for a Jupiter-sized\nplanet. The value of N is indicated above each plot, and a corresponding eccentricity scale is given to the right of the plots.\nThe four plots corresponds to eccentricity values at i = 0 of 0.5,\n0.8, 0.9 and 0.99 (these values appear at the lower right corner\nof the plots). In all these plots, the eccentricity variation over\nmost of the plot is very moderate. Hence each of these plots\nshould be regarded as a picture of the dynamics in a given eccentricity regime. The plots of Fig. 2 are equivalent to those of\nFig. 5 from Morbidelli & Moons (1993) for the 2:1 resonance.\nConsider now a given particle trapped in the 4:1 resonance which starts its eccentricity growth. In a low eccentricity\nregime, like the one for e = 0.5 (N = 1.973), the inclination\nremains low while \u03c9 circulates. Following a level curve of H,\nif the inclination is initially low (a few degrees), it undergoes\nsmall variations that keep it in the same range. At a higher eccentricity regime, the phase portrait changes. We note in Fig. 2\nthat two islands of libration for \u03c9 appear around \u03c9 = \u00b190\u25e6 .\nHowever, these islands of libration do not concern the particles\nwe are considering. Our particles start within the plane of the\ndisk with an inclination that does not exceed a few degrees.\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. Level curves of the Hamiltonian H in the (\u03c9, i) plane for the circular problem, for particles having negligible \u03c3-libration\namplitude, for different values of the constant parameter N. The eccentricity scale (denoted \"e\" on the right of the plots) is related\nto the inclination scale to the left by the constant value of N.\nHence the curves they follow are those located below the islands of libration. For our particles, \u03c9 still circulates, but following the level curves, the inclination i is subject to periodic\njumps up to possibly several tens of degrees when \u03c9 reaches 0\nor \u03c0. The higher the eccentricity regime, the higher the inclination jumps. This is the origin of the inclination oscillations\nreported in the numerical integration.\nThis dynamics is a resonant version of the Kozai dynamics. In the non-resonant circular restricted problem, the\nKozai Hamiltonian describes the secular dynamics of the particle. It is obtained by a double averaging of the original\n\nHamiltonian over the orbital motions of the planet and of\nthe particles (Kinoshita & Nakai 1999). It is well known that\nthis Hamiltonian has a secular constant of motion which is\nthe z-component of the angular momentum (or equivalently\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 e2 cos i = cst). It is also well known that at high inclination, this Hamiltonian shows two islands of libration in (i, \u03c9)\nspace around \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, and that particles moving in these islands evolve periodically from a high inclination and low eccentricity regime to a low inclination and high eccentricity.\nThis behaviour constitutes the Kozai resonance (Kozai 1962).\n\n\f8\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nBeust & Morbidelli (2000) and Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001). This\nis illustrated in Fig. 3. In this figure, we consider a typical simulation described in Beust & Morbidelli (2000), with e\u2032 = 0.07\nand \u03bc = 0.002. As described in that paper, the simulation is\nmade over 104 particles initially chosen orbiting the star in 4:1\nmean motion resonances with the perturbing planets. The initial eccentricities are randomly chosen \u2264 0.1 and the inclinations \u2264 5\u25e6 . In Beust & Morbidelli (2000), it was shown that\nmany of the particles evolve to the FEB regime, and we perform statistics over the expected Doppler velocities when the\nFEBs cross the line of sight. This statistic appears in agreement\nwith the observational one. In Fig. 3, we display information\nabout the inclinations of the particles when they are in the FEB\nregime. More specifically, we count all periastron passages for\nthe particles with periastron values less than 0.4 AU (the FEB\nregime), and that are not yet destroyed by evaporation. Figure 3\nshows that the highest inclinations correspond to the smallest\nperiastron values. This is in agreement with the theory outlined\nabove (Fig. 2) which shows that the high inclination oscillations are to be expected in the high eccentricity regime only,\ni.e. in the FEB regime. Fig. 3 also shows that whenever they\nreach high inclinations, the FEBs assume an argument of periastron close to \u00b1\u03c0/2. This is in agreement with the theory, and\ndemonstrates the reality of the proposed mechanism. Moreover,\nthe concentration of points close to \u03c9 \u00b1 \u03c0/2 shows that the\nFEBs spend more time in high inclination regimes than in low\nregimes. This is confirmed directly by the temporal evolution\nof the inclination in Fig. 1.\nFig. 3. A statistical test of the inclination oscillation regime for\nFEBs. These results concern a typical simulation described in\nBeust & Morbidelli (2000) with e\u2032 = 0.07 and \u03bc = 0.002. Each\ndot corresponds to a series of periastron passages of a body\nthat has entered the FEB regime (periastron <\n\u223c 0.4), and that is\nnot yet fully evaporated. Top plot : Inclination as a function\nof periastron; Bottom plot : inclination as a function of the\nargument of periastron \u03c9\n\nThe islands of libration in the plots of Fig. 2 describe a\nKozai resonance, within a mean-motion resonance. Indeed, as\na is fixed the condition\nN = cst is exactly equivalent to the\n\u221a\nKozai condition 1 \u2212 e2 cos i = cst. The FEBs trapped in the\n4:1 resonance that evolve at very high eccentricity regimes are\nconcerned by this, but they are not trapped into the Kozai resonance, as their argument of periastron \u03c9 still circulates, and as\nthey periodically return to i \u2243 0. However the Kozai dynamics influences them and causes periodic inclination jumps up to\nseveral tens of degrees, even if the initial inclination is low (a\nfew degrees).\n\n3.3. Tests over a large number of bodies\nTo test the statistical effect of the eccentricity jumps reported,\na numerical test over a large number of bodies is necessary. In\nfact it was not necessary to perform new simulations. We just\ntake the (still available) results of the simulations described in\n\n4. Stopping the ions\nWe showed in the previous section that, due to their inclination oscillations, the FEBs constitute a potential source of Ca ii\nand Fe i ions that may escape far off the disk plane. These ions\n\u2013 being blown away by a strong radiation pressure \u2013 should\naccelerate mostly freely and reach the outer parts of the disk\nwith high velocities, up to \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 . However, such velocities would be in sharp contradiction to the observations by\nB04, where the Ca ii ions are found at rest with respect to the\nstar, about 116 AU away. This implies that some process is able\nto efficiently slow down the ions despite the intense radiation\npressure they undergo (\u03b2 = 35, see above).\nThis issue was investigated recently by Fern\u00e1ndez et al.\n(2006, hereafter F06), as many metallic species are observed at\nrest relative to the star despite a strong radiation pressure. They\nidentified three possible braking processes : collisions among\nions, collisions with charged ions, and collisions with a neutral gas. Collisions among ions are very efficient (Beust et al.\n1989), and the whole plasma tends to behave like a single fluid\nwith a weighted average \u03b2. However, F06 show that unless carbon is overabundant, the fluid is still accelerated by the star.\nCollisions with charged grains are only efficient if the grains\nare mostly carbonaceous. Moreover, at high latitude in the disk\nwhere the Ca ii is observed, the density of the dust is low (0.3%\nof that of the midplane according to the profile given by F06).\nCollisions with neutral gas are conversely a good candidate.\nF06 showed that a minimum mass of neutral gas of \u223c 0.03 M\u2295\nis enough to stop the ions. However, due to the high incom-\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\ning velocity of the Ca ii ions, the basic analytic model must\nbe revised. We detail this below, and conclude that the actual\nbraking is even more effective than in the basic formulation.\n\n4.1. Stopping with gas\n\nNeutral species like H i or He i or even H2 are not subject to\nany significant radiation pressure from the star (Lagrange et al.\n1998); they may thus stay orbiting in a Keplerian way at some\ndistance from the star. The incoming Ca ii ions may then collide into this buffer gas and be slowed down to negligible velocity. This process was also invoked as a way to stop Ca ii\nions a few AU from the star in order to generate the stable circumstellar Ca ii absorption (Lagrange et al. 1998). In that work,\nwe showed that a column density of \u223c 1018 cm\u22122 is enough to\nslow down the Ca ii ions. Here we investigate whether the same\nmechanism could also apply to decelerate faster off-plane ions.\nThe rapid off-plane ions are not stopped at a few AU like\nthose that stay within the plane because they do not encounter\nany noticeable gaseous medium at their orbital inclination.\nWhy should they be stopped around 116 AU ? We must assume that at such a distance, the disk tends to flare. Hence\nsome dilute material could be present at 30\u25e6 or more in the\nouter disk while remaining absent in the inner disk. But why\n116 AU ? This distance corresponds approximately to the location of the power law break-up in the surface brightness radial\nprofile of the disk (Heap et al. 2000). Closer to this threshold,\nthe surface brightness decreases as r\u22121.1 , while further away it\nfalls off much more steeply as r\u22125.5 . This was interpreted by\nAugereau et al. (2001) as a consequence of the distribution of\nplanetesimals in the disk. The dust particles are produced by\nthe planetesimals and then scattered into the outer disk by the\nstellar radiation pressure. The power law break-up at \u223c 120 AU\nis consistent with a planetesimal disk presenting a rather sharp\nouter edge located at this distance (Augereau et al. 2001). The\nplanetesimals disk appears thus to be truncated at the same distance where the off-plane Ca ii ions stop. These facts may be\nrelated. The flaring of the disk that we invoke at that distance\nfor stopping the Ca ii ions could be due to the perturbations by\nsuccessive stellar flybys, as was invoked by Larwood & Kalas\n(2001) as an explanation for asymmetries and arc-like structures in the outer parts of the circumstellar dust disk. But the\nsame mechanism could also be invoked to account for the truncation of the planetesimal disk at the same distance. Further\naway than 120 AU, the planetesimals are perturbed by stellar\nflybys, and may not remain in a thin disk. Also the planetesimals themselves may not have had the opportunity to form\nthere. The stellar flybys may have scattered away (and probably in the vertical direction) the initial material from which the\nplanetesimals were expected to form. Thus, the \u03b2 Pic disk beyond 120 AU could still be in a kind of primordial state where\nno refractory material condensation would have occurred, with\na significant flaring due to stellar flybys.\n\n9\n\n4.1.1. The analytical induced dipole model and its\nlimitations\nWe now review the basic mechanism of decelerating by a neutral medium, noting that we depart from the situation described\nin Lagrange et al. (1998), in two points: i) the volume density\nof the incoming ions and of the colliding medium is probably much less at 116 AU and 30\u25e6 inclination than in the plane\nat a few AU; therefore no significant pressure effect is to be\nexpected and the hydrodynamic description may be dropped;\nii) the incoming velocity of the Ca ii ions is likely to be much\nhigher. In the limiting case of a free ballistic runaway driven by\nthe radiative pressure of the unobscured star, the resulting velocity is \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 , about two orders of magnitude higher\nthan was considered in Lagrange et al. (1998).\nA simple collisional decelerating mechanism was initially\ndescribed in Beust et al. (1989) for moderate velocities. When\na charged ion approaches a neutral atom, a dipole is induced\non the neutral atom, from which an interaction results between\nthe two particles that may be well described by the potential\nenergy\nV(r) =\n\n1 \u03b1q2\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 2r4\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the polarizability of the atom, r is the interaction\ndistance, and q is the charge of the ion, the other symbols having their usual meaning (McDaniel 1964). The relative motion\nin this potential cannot be solved exactly, but there is a critical impact parameter b0 (that depends on the impact velocity\nv) separating two regimes : for b > b0 there is a minimum\napproach distance between the particles preventing any close\ncollision; for b < b0 this is not so, and the particles undergo a\nphysical collision (see appendix B). A fairly correct approximation is then to neglect the effect of the encounter for b > b0 ,\nand to consider that the mean impulsion loss by the ion in the\nphysical collision is \u03bcv, where \u03bc is the reduced mass. The interaction cross section is then \u03c0b20 and the resulting drag force\nf is opposed to velocity :\nf = \u2212\u03bc\u03c0b20 nv v\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n is the number volume density of neutrals. The expression of b0 (see appendix B) is\n!1/4\n1 4\u03b1q2\n(6)\nb0 =\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03bcv2\nso that the resulting force is proportional to the velocity:\nf = \u2212kv with\ns\n4\u03bc\u03b1q2\nk = n\u03c0\n.\n(7)\n4\u03c0\u01eb0\nWe confirmed to within 5% this simple analytical approximation of the drag force using the more general numerical treatment described later on.\nHowever this induced dipole regime holds as long as the\ndrift velocity v is not too large. When v grows, b0 becomes\nsmaller than the physical size of the particles. In this regime the\ninteraction cannot be described any longer as attractive, and it\n\n\f10\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nTable 2.

The ab initio calculated interaction potential between\nCa ii and H i (in their ground triplet state) as a function of the\nmutual distance (fat line), superimposed on the induced dipole\npotential (thin line)\nrather approaches a hard sphere regime at shorter range with a\nconstant cross section that does not depend on v. According to\nEq. (5), the drag force turns out now to be proportional to v2\ninstead of v. Table 2 lists computed values of b0 for different\nvalues of v for the Ca ii \u2013 H i interaction (the polarisability of\n\u22121\nH i is 6.7\u00d710\u221231 m3 ). We note that as soon as v >\n\u223c 10 km s , this\ninduced dipole model becomes unrealistic because b0 becomes\ncomparable to or smaller than typical atomic radii. Hence Ca ii\nions that encounter H i atoms at \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 undergo a collisional interaction that is similar to a hard sphere regime. As the\nvelocity decreases along successive collisions, the interaction\nfinally enters the induced dipole regime. A correct description\nof the decelerating process of the Ca ii ions implies therefore to\nbe able to describe the interaction at every velocity, in particular in the intermediate velocity regime between the two above\ndescribed extremes.\n\n4.1.2. The \"smooth sphere\" model\nIn order to have a more coherent description, we introduced a\n\"smooth\" sphere approximation based upon a continuous description of the interaction potential U(r) between Ca ii and\nH i as a function of the relative distance r. The interaction\noriginates from a quantum-mechanical interaction at the microscopic level. During a collision, the incoming Ca ii and H i\nparticles form an intermediate molecular ion. This molecular\ncomplex possess two valence electrons originating from each\nincoming particle. In a quantum description of the interaction,\nthese two electronic spins recouple to form either a singlet or\ntriplet state with a 3 to 1 probability in favour of the triplet\nstate. However in the case of energetic collisions these input\n\nstates will interact with various excited states of the same spin\nmultiplicity, leading to numerous inelastic processes that will\nbe sketched in the the next subsection.\nFortunately the ground state triplet state is not expected to\nbe very reactive for moderate collisional energies and could\nprovide a realistic basis for our \"smooth\" sphere model. Using\nthe ab-initio Gaussian 94 package (Frisch et al 1995) we investigated the triplet input state using a restricted open-shell\napproach (in order to preserve the total spin). We performed\nROMP2 calculations to take into account the electronic correlation and also to some extent the interactions with excited states.\nWe added diffuse and polarization functions on both centers,\npaying special attention to the proper description of the polarisation of the hydrogen atom. We also performed a population\nanalysis at the Mulliken level to check that charge transfer effects were small (contrary to the singlet state where strong inverse charge transfer effects were found). The resulting triplet\npotential is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of r, superimposed on\nthe induced dipole interaction. Our ab-initio potential is consistent with the induced dipole approximation beyond 0.5 nm, but\ncloser to 0.5 nm, it exhibits a repulsive wall providing a smooth\ntransition towards the limiting hard sphere regime.\nLet us now take into account this \"smooth\" sphere potential for a determination of the drag force. Given any interaction\npotential U(r), the drag force acting on the ion is opposed to\nthe velocity and may be written as\n! #\n\"Z +\u221e\n2 \u03c7(b, v)\ndb v\n,\n(8)\nf = \u22124\u03c0n\u03bcv\nb sin\n2\n0\nwhere b is the impact parameter, and \u03c7(b, v) is the deflection\nangle due to the encounter corresponding to b and v. \u03c7(b, v)\nitself depends on the form of the potential and may be obtained\nfrom an integral along the relative motion during the encounter\n(see appendix B).\n\n4.1.3. Beyond the \"smooth sphere\" model: the\n\"inelastic\" model\nThe above expression for the drag force assumes implicitly that\nthe encounters between the ion and the hydrogen atoms are\nelastic.\nOn the contrary, energetic collisions are likely to trigger\nvarious inelastic processes. For impact velocities in the range\n100\u20131000 km s\u22121 , the energy available in the center of mass is\nhuge, from 50 eV to 5000 eV, and is able to induce a large variety of excitations in both the valence and core electronic space.\nBeyond the mere electronic excitation of either particles, these\nenergetic collisions can thus trigger a whole range of inelastic\nand reactive processes including inverse charge transfer, single\nor multiple electronic ionizations, etc. . . Collisions with He i or\nH2 will be even more energetic due to the larger reduced mass.\nA detailed theoretical description of all these processes and of\ntheir cross sections and branching ratios is beyond the range of\nthe present study. Experimental investigations might provide a\nbetter starting point for further studies.\nAll these inelastic processes will convert a part of the incoming kinetic energy into internal energy of the particles and\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nalso, if ionization occurs, into kinetic energy of the secondary\nelectrons. Of course the internal excitations will mostly decay\nradiatively and will never be converted back to kinetic energy\nof the Ca ii ions. In addition, the Ca ii ions are likely to increase their charge, following either simple or multiple ionization, or inverse charge transfer with H i 1 . Once ionized to Ca iii\nor higher, the calcium ions are expected to recombine to Ca ii\nafter a while. But during the time they spend at higher ionization states, they should be decelerated even more effectively,\nbecause they no longer feel any significant radiation pressure\nfrom the star (as the species under consideration have no strong\nspectral lines in the visible-UV domain), while the drag force\nis expected to increase with ionization level.\nMoreover, the neutral H i gas, once shocked by the incoming high velocity ions, is expected to be partly ionized by this\nprocess. The gas will thus tend to behave like a plasma with\na collective dynamical behaviour, resulting in an averaged \u03b2\nratio, as described by F06. These collective effects should enhance significantly the efficiency of the braking process.\nAll these inelastic effects will increase the energy loss\nby the Ca ii ions and thus the drag force predicted by the\nsmooth sphere model. Their description is beyond the scope\nof the present paper. In the following we propose an order-ofmagnitude calculation using a very crude model to describe the\nionization processes involving collisions between Ca ii ions and\nH i atoms. A simple way to treat possible ionization is to monitor the available kinetic energy 1/2\u03bcv2 before the collision in\nthe inertial referential frame. First we select close collisions for\nwhich the interaction departs from the induced-dipole model.\nSecond we consider the opening of successive ionization channels when the energy is augmented. We model the ionization\nfor H i and up to 7 electrons for Ca ii, assuming an average energy loss Ip = 20 eV per electron. This loss is supposed to take\ninto account both the extraction energy and the kinetic energy\nof the expelled electron. The ionization limit of 7 electrons for\nCa ii is rather arbitrary and includes the 2p shell and the outer\n3s electron. The most energetic collisions might rather ionize\nan inner 1s electron, but this would result in a comparable energy loss because their binding energy is higher, about 150 eV.\nIn practice, we modify the smooth sphere model with the\nfollowing prescription. If the available kinetic energy exceeds\nk \u00d7 Ip with k \u2264 8 and if the closest approach between the two\nparticles is less than 0.5 nm, the incoming kinetic energy is arbitrarily reduced by k\u00d7Ip . This causes the relative velocity after\nthe encounter v\u2032 to be less than the initial velocity v. We define\nthe energy restitution coefficient e < 1 as v\u2032 = ev. This may be\nwritten as:\n1 \u20322 1 2 2 1 2\nmv = e mv = mv \u2212 kIp\n.\n(9)\n2\n2\n2\nIf we assume for simplicity that the deflection angle \u03c7 is unchanged with respect to the elastic case, then the expression of\nthe force becomes now\n!\n!\n#\n\"Z +\u221e\n2 \u03c7(b, v)\n+ 1 \u2212 e b db v\n.(10)\nf = \u22122\u03c0n\u03bcv\n2e sin\n2\n0\n1\n\nIn view of our ab-initio investigations, this latter process is expected already to be important at moderate energies for collisions in a\nsinglet electronic state.\n\n11\n\nFig. 5. The drag force on Ca ii ions due to a H i medium of\nunit density (1 m\u22123 ), as a function of the drift velocity v. The\nthin line corresponds to the induced dipole model, the thick\ngrey line to the smooth model (based upon the triplet potential\nshown in Fig. 4) and the thick black line to the inelastic model\n(based upon the combination of the triplet potential and a crude\ntreatment for ionization effects, see text).\n\nHere the coefficient e is implicitly a function of b and v, as\nexplained above.\nThe result of the force computation in the various cases is\nshown in Fig. 5 as a function of the relative velocity v. As in\nany case the drag force is proportional to the density of the\nH i medium encountered, showing the force for a unit density\nmedium is enough for comparison purposes. In the induced\ndipole approximation case, we find as expected f \u221d v, and we\nsee that this approximation is valid up to v \u2243 20 km s\u22121 . At the\nhigher velocity regime, we have f \u221d v2 when the triplet potential is taken into account, corresponding to our smooth sphere\nregime. When ionization is also taken into account, the nonelastic character of the interactions adds an extra force term\nto the elastic smooth sphere case. Inelastic effects turns out to\n\u22121\nbe particularly noticeable for 100 km s\u22121 <\n\u223c v <\n\u223c 1000 km s\n(at higher velocity ionization is present but the smooth sphere\nregime dominates). This velocity regime concerns Ca ii ions encountering a H i medium at about 116 AU. Consequently, this\norder-of-magnitude calculation suggests that a proper inclusion\nof ionization and other inelastic effects would significantly enhance the effective drag force beyond the predictions of the\nsmooth sphere model.\n\n4.1.4. Estimate of the required H i column density\nNow we have an estimate of the drag force, it is of interest to\nderive in which conditions the H i medium is able to stop the\nCa ii ions. Irrespective of the initial velocity, if the medium is\ndense enough, the ions will always be stopped. The question\nis to know the amount of H i neutrals required to do this, and\nmore specifically the column density Ns the ions need to cross\nbefore being stopped. Let us first consider a simplified case\nwhere radiation pressure is not taken into account. The ions\narrive at initial velocity v0 and encounter an H i medium with\n\n\f12\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nvolume density n. The equation of motion of an ion along its\npath will be\nm\n\ndv\n= \u2212nF(v)\ndt\n\n(11)\n\n,\n\nwhere m is the mass of the ion, and F(v) is the force per unit\ndensity shown in Fig. 5. We change the dependent variable t to\nthe integrated encountered column density N (dN = nv dt):\nmv\n\ndv\n= \u2212F(v)\ndN\n\n(12)\n\n,\n\nfrom which we immediately derive the integrated column density Ns required to slow the ions from v0 to 0:\nZ v0\nv\nNs = m\ndv\n.\n(13)\nF(v)\n0\nLet us now reintroduce the radiation pressure as a constant\nforce P. The equation of motion is\nm\n\ndv\n= P \u2212 nF(v)\ndt\n\n(14)\n\n,\n\nwhich is equivalent to\nmv\n\nP\ndv\n= \u2212 F(v)\ndN\nn\n\nFig. 6. H i column density necessary to stop Ca ii ions, as a\nfunction of the initial velocity v0 , as derived from Eq. 13, according to several models (see text). The plotting conventions\nare the same as in Fig. 5.\n\n(15)\n\n.\n\nThe ions are now no longer exactly stopped, but rather slowed\ndown to an equilibrium velocity veq characterised by nF(veq ) =\nP. In practice this terminal velocity is low, so that the ions may\nbe considered as stopped. The radiation pressure P at 116 AU\non Ca ii ions is \u223c 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221229 N (35 times stellar gravity). Let us\ntake the upper limit of 1018 cm\u22122 for the hydrogen column density given by Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2001), spread over a\ndistance d. We derive a ratio\nP\n= F(veq ) \u2243 2.5 10\u221241 \u00d7 d(AU) N m\u22123\nn\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nIf we consider as a maximum value for d a few tens of AU, a\ncomparison with Fig. 5 shows that veq is less than 1 km s\u22121 and\nthat it falls well within the induced dipole regime. This result\nstill holds even if we assume a column density lower by one or\neven two orders of magnitudes.\nStrictly speaking, an infinite column density is required to\nreach veq . We should write\nZ v0\nv\ndv\n.\n(17)\nNs = m\nveq F(v) \u2212 F(veq )\nAs close to veq , we have F(v) \u221d v, we derive that the integral\ndiverges logarithmically towards veq . But reaching a velocity\nthat is of the same order of magnitude as veq is enough for our\npurpose. Moreover, for v >> veq we have F(v) >> F(veq ), so\nthat F(veq ) can be neglected in Eq. 17. Finally, Eq. (13) turns\nout to be a good estimate for Ns even in the presence of radiation pressure. This is due to the fact that the terminal velocity\nveq is very low.\nNs as given from Eq. (13) is plotted on Fig. 6 as a function of the initial velocity, for the various interaction models considered. As expected, in the induced dipole regime,\nwe have Ns \u221d v0 , but at higher velocity, Ns is reduced by\n\nseveral orders of magnitude with respect to that crude estimate. The smooth sphere model causes Ns to stay below a few\n1017 cm\u22122 (asymptotically Ns \u221d ln v0 ). With v0 = 1000 km s\u22121 ,\nwe predict Ns \u2243 1017 cm\u22122 . This is one order of magnitude below the upper limit to the H2 column density towards \u03b2 Pic\n(Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2001). As suggested by our inelastic model, the inclusion of inelastic effects would further\nlower the required column density. Moreover, the collective effects decribed by F06, due to partial ionization of the neutral\ngas, are expected to enhance the braking process. Ns could thus\nbe even less than the value we derive.\nHence we stress that the model we present here provides a\nplausible mechanism for stopping the Ca ii ions at 100 AU from\n\u03b2 Pic, in order to render them detectable in emission.\n\n4.2. Stopping with a magnetic field\nAnother natural interaction ions that may be subjected to is\nthe influence of a magnetic field B they would encounter at\n100 AU. In the presence of a magnetic field, the equation of\nmotion of an ion is\nm\n\ndv\n= P +qv\u00d7 B\ndt\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere P is the radial radiation pressure. Let us consider for\nsimplicity that P is constant (the ions are supposed to be\nstopped over a short distance), as is B. The equation of motion\nhas a well known analytical solution. Introducing a referential\nframe (Ox, Oy, Oz) where B k Oz and P lies in the xOz plane,\nand the angle \u03c6 between P and the xOy plane, the solution may\nbe described in that referential as\nh\ni\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nv x = \u03c9g cos \u03c6 R cos(\u03c9g t) + L sin(\u03c9g t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nvy = \u03c9g cos \u03c6 L(cos(\u03c9g t) \u2212 1) \u2212 R sin(\u03c9g t)\n(19)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 vz = \u03c9g sin \u03c6 L\u03c9g t + R\n.\nThe ion is supposed to initially move radially at velocity v0 .\nHere \u03c9g = qB/m is the gyromagnetic frequency; R = mv0 /qB\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nis the gyromagnetic radius associated with the velocity v0 ; L\nis defined as P = mL\u03c92g , i.e., it is a characteristic length associated with the strength of the radiation pressure. The motion\nperpendicular to the field is a cycloid-like motion,\ni.e., a com\u221a\nbination of a circular motion of radius \u03c1 = R2 + L2 cos \u03c6 at\nfrequency \u03c9g and of a linear drift at velocity L\u03c9g cos \u03c6. The\nmotion parallel to the field is uniformly accelerated by the radiation pressure. It is important to note that here, contrary to\nthe neutral drift model, the velocity does not reach an asymptotic value. If the field is not perpendicular to P (sin \u03c6 , 0)\nthe velocity even increases continuously. But even if sin \u03c6 = 0\nthe motion in the xOy plane is still cycloid-like, and the modulus of velocity undergoes a periodic modulation of amplitude\n2\u03c1\u03c9g . Let us now consider a typical magnetic field of 1\u03bcG,\nat 116 AU from the star, and v0 = 1000 km s\u22121 . We derive\nL = 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 AU and R = 0.028 AU. Hence L \u226a R (i.e.,\nthe Lorentz force dominates the radiation pressure), and \u03c1 \u2243 R.\nThis yields 2\u03c1\u03c9g \u2243 2v0 = 2000 km s\u22121 . The ions turn out to\nhave velocities relative to the star randomly distributed over a\nrange of 2000 km s\u22121 . Even if the ions do not drift away significantly, their residual velocity range remain far above the\nspectral resolution of the instruments, and they should not be\nobserved as a single line at rest with respect to the star. In consequence, this purely magnetic deceleration model cannot account for the observations.\n\n4.3. Combining gas drag and magnetic field\nWe investigate the possible combination of the two preceding models, i.e., combining a magnetic field and gas drag. The\nequation of motion is now\ndv\n= P +qv\u00d7 B+ f\n,\n(20)\ndt\nwhere f is the gas drag force. In the general case where f is\ngiven by Fig. 5, this equation cannot be solved analytically, but\nat low velocity in the induced dipole regime where f = \u2212kv, the\ndifferential system remains linear and may be solved exactly\nafter a somewhat lengthy but straightforward algebra.

The motion is still combination of a circular motion and a linear drift, but the circular motion is damped\nexponentially at frequency \u03c9r , so that the velocity assumes an\nasymptotic value like in the gas drag case without a magnetic\nfield.\nTaking now the numbers given above, and considering a\ntypical expected neutral density of 104 cm\u22123 (a column density\n\n13\n\nof \u223c 1017 cm\u22122 over \u223c 1 AU), we derive \u03c9g \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121\nand \u03c9g /\u03c9r \u2243 78. Hence the exponential damping is a slower\nprocess than the gyromagnetic motion. As \u03c9r \u226a \u03c9g , the numerical value of L is virtually unchanged with respect to the\npreceding definition, and we still have L \u226a R. After damping,\nthe ions have a terminal velocity with respect to the gas given\nby\n\nvt =\n\nL(\u03c92r + \u03c92g )\n\u03c9r\n\nv\nt\n\n\u03c92r + \u03c92g sin2 \u03c6\n\u03c92r + \u03c92g\n\nP\n=\nk\n\u2243\n\nv\nt\n\n\u03c92r + \u03c92g sin2 \u03c6\n\u03c92r + \u03c92g\n\nP\nsin \u03c6 .\nk\n\n(22)\n\nP/k is the equilibrium velocity veq given by Eq. (16) in the gas\ndrag case, in the case of the induced dipole regime. Hence the\nterminal velocity vt appears in any case less than veq . It can even\nreach zero if the field is perpendicular to the initial motion.\nFinally, the net result of the interaction is a deceleration\nof the ions that is similar to the non-magnetic case. The terminal velocity is comparable (or even less), and it is reached\nwithin the same characteristic time 1/\u03c9r = m/k. The only difference concerns the path of the ions. When no magnetic field\nis present, the motion of the ions is linear and they are stopped\nafter having encountered a column density of 1017 cm\u22122 , i.e.,\n0.7 AU with n = 104 cm\u22123 . With a magnetic field, the path\nis no longer linear. When \u03c6 = 0, the radial extent of the\nspiral motion of the ions before being stopped is \u2243 2\u03c1\u2032 at\nt = 0, i.e., \u2243 2R. With the values quoted above, this is about\n0.055 AU; with n = 104 cm\u22123 , the corresponding column density is \u223c 8.3 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . Hence the ions appear to be stopped\nover a much shorter distance. This is only due to the fact that\nthe motion is not linear. As the ions spiral into the quoted distance, they encounter the required 1017 cm\u22122 to stop them, but\nnot in a linear fashion, rather inside a box of smaller dimensions.\nThe magnetic field appears then as an additional source of\ndeceleration for the ions, but the gas drag remains unavoidable.\nOur conclusion is then that a magnetic field may be invoked as\na refinement to the model, but that it is not necessary, the basic\nprocess of deceleration remaining the gas drag.\nThe main issue concerning the magnetic field should be its\nsudden presence around 100 AU. Why should a magnetic field\nof 1 \u03bcG appear there while not present closer to the star ? The\nonly possibility is to invoke a kind of heliopause. \u03b2 Pictoris is\nthe only normal A type star for which a chromospheric activity was detected by Bouret et al. (2002). These authors derive a\nmass loss rate \u1e40 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , with a terminal velocity of 200 km s\u22121 . Roughly speaking, the suspected heliopause\nshould be expected where the magnetic pressure B2 /2\u03bc0 of the\nsurrounding galactic field equals the kinetic pressure of the\nwind. With the values of Bouret et al. (2002) and B = 1 \u03bcG,\nit occurs at 529 AU; alternatively, if we want this to occur at\n116 AU, a galactic field of 4.5 \u03bcG is required. Inside this cavity, the field would be radial and have no effect on the motion of\nthe ions. These are likely values, so that the possibility cannot\nbe excluded.\n\n\f14\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\n5. Conclusion\nThe presence of metallic ions at fairly high latitude over the\nmid-plane of the \u03b2 Pic circumstellar disk, as observed by B04,\ncan be very well explained as a consequence of the FEB process. Whenever the evaporating bodies enter the star grazing\nregime, they are subject to inclination oscillations up to \u223c 30 \u2013\n40\u25e6 . The Ca ii ions released by the FEB during this phase start\na free, almost radial expansion pushed by a strong radiation\npressure, keeping track of their initial orbital inclination. Iron\nis also concerned by this process, and we expect Fe i ions to\nbe present at high latitude together with Ca ii. The Fe i in the\ndata of B04 is not null where Ca ii is detected. We nevertheless\nexplain in our emission line analysis that, unless the electronic\ndensity is high, the Fe i emission is expected to be weaker than\nthe Ca ii one, thanks to a predominant ionization of Fe i into\nFe ii.\nThis process does not concern Na i ions because, once produced by the FEBs, they are quickly photoionized into Na ii\nand subsequently no longer experience any noticeable radiation pressure. Hence we explain the absence of Na i emission\nat high latitude.\nBlown away by strong radiative pressure from the star, the\nCa ii ions reach the distance of \u223c 100 AU in about 1 yr with final velocities of \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 . They need thus to be slowed\ndown in order to gather at the star velocity and to form an observable line. This can be achieved if the ions encounter at that\ndistance a neutral gaseous medium, in agreement with the conclusions of F06. A rough estimate of the incoming ion flux due\nto the FEB activity shows that it can account for the necessary\nheating source to render the lines observable.\nIn addition to the induced dipole drag force considered by\nF06, we estimated additional braking effects arising for rapid\ncollisional velocities. If we consider the effect of repulsive core\nand inelastic interactions discussed in Sec 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, a\ncolumn density of 1017 cm\u22122 of H i is sufficient to stop the ions\nover a distance of a few AU. The inelastic model we introduced\nis probably very crude, but it is still likely to underestimate\nthe effective drag force. Therefore irrespective of the detailed\ndescription of the interaction processes, the required column\ndensity remains below the upper detection limit of 1018 cm\u22122\ngiven by Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2001). Following F06,\nit should even be less if we took into account the collective\nplasma behaviour due to partial ionization of the neutral gas\ninto account. Conversely, due to the high latitude over the dust\ndisk, we do not expect collisions with dust grains (invoked by\nF06 as a possible braking mechanism) to play a significant role\nin the decelerating process of the incoming ions.\nWe also investigate the possible role of a magnetic field\nin stopping the ions. While the sole action of a magnetic field\nis unable to sufficiently slow down the ions, magnetic interactions provide an additional braking process to the basic gas\ndrag model invoked. Combining gas drag and magnetic interactions can thus be a very efficient way to decelerate the ions,\nstill reducing the requirements on the neutral gas density by an\norder of magnitude. This nevertheless constitutes a refinement\nof the model, as gas drag in itself is sufficient to account for\ncurrent observational constraints.\n\nThe key parameter in this model is the distance (\u223c 100 AU)\nat which the ions are stopped. In the gas drag model, we need to\nassume that no neutral medium is present at 30\u25e6 inclination up\nto that distance, so that the ions can freely expand radially, and\nthat they suddenly encounter some medium there. This would\nmean that the disk begins to significantly flare at that distance.\nAs explained above, this distance corresponds also to the expected outer edge of the planetesimal disk that produces the\ndust, according to Augereau et al. (2001). These two facts are\nprobably related.\nOur conclusion is thus that the proposed scenario is plausible. Another important issue in this study is the number of\nCa ii or Fe i ions necessary to account for the observations of\nB04. It cannot be determined easily even if we may estimate\nthe incoming flux, as it depends highly on the time the ions\nstay within the neutral medium before diffusing away, and subsequently on the small asymptotic drift velocity they reach. If a\nmagnetic field plays a role, this velocity is expected to be significantly lower than without a field; hence the ions should drift\nmore slowly across the neutral medium. At a given epoch, for\nthe same incoming Ca ii flux more ions are therefore expected\nto be trapped in the neutral gas if magnetic forces are active\nthan in the opposite case. This is why deriving an incoming\nCa ii flux in order to compare to the expected number of FEBs\nis very imprecise. This could be the purpose of future investigations. Fortunately the uncertainties in the proposed deceleration models are irrelevant here, because once the ions have\nbeen decelerated, the analytical induced dipole model should\nbe valid.\nOur estimate of the incoming ions flux due to FEB activity\n(Sect. 2) is very rough, mainly because the FEB activity itself\nis hard to constrain. Moreover, we expect this activity to be\ntime-variable, as changes have been observed between various\nobserving epochs (Tobin et al. 2004). As the emission lines are\nsupposed to depend on this flux (via the heating source), we\nexpect the strength of the emission lines to present temporal\nvariations (at least those at high latitude). It would thus be of\ninterest to initiate a follow-up of these lines to check for temporal changes.\nThe FEB scenario is reinforced by the present analysis. The\noff-plane presence of some metallic species, and the absence\nof some others, appear as a natural consequence of the FEB\nscenario and of the mean-motion resonance model with a giant\nplanet. This strengthens our view of the \u03b2Pic system as a young\nplanetary system.\n\nAppendix A: Mean-motion resonance theory\nWe describe here the non-planar restricted three-body problem,\nwith a mass-less test particle orbiting a star, and perturbed by a\nplanet orbiting the star. The position vectors of the particle and\nthe planet relative to the star are noted r and r\u2032 respectively.\nAs usual, we call \u03bc the ratio of the mass of the planet to the\ntotal mass of the system m. We assume that \u03bc \u226a 1. In this\nframework, the Hamiltonian of the problem is (see, for instance\nMorbidelli & Moons 1993)\n!\nr * r\u2032\n1\n1\u2212\u03bc\n,\n(A.1)\n\u2212\u03bc\n\u2212\nH0 = \u2212\n2a\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nr\u20323\n\n\fBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nwhere a is the osculating semi-major axis of the orbit of the\nparticle. Here the Hamiltonian has been normalised by the constant factor Gm, where G is the constant of gravitation. The\nusual way is then to start from the classical canonically conjugate Delaunay variables :\np\nM , L = (1 \u2212 \u03bc)a\n\u221a\n.\n(A.2)\n\u03c9 , G = L 1 \u2212 e2\n\u03a9 , H = G cos i\n\nHere M is the mean anomaly along the orbit of the particle, \u03c9\nis its argument of periastron, \u03a9 its longitude of ascending node,\ne its eccentricity and i its inclination with respect to the orbital\nplane of the planet.\nWe assume here that the particle is locked in a (p + q) : p\nmean-motion resonance with the planet. It is then of interest\nto introduce new canonically conjugate angle-action variables\nthat take into account the resonance :\np+q \u2032 p\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2212\u031f , S = L\u2212G\n\u03c3=\nq\nq\np+q \u2032 p\n\u03c3z =\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03a9 , Sz = G \u2212 H\n(A.3)\nq\nq\np+q\np+q \u2032 p\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\n, N=\nL\u2212H\n\u2212\u03bd =\nq\nq\np\nThe modified Hamiltonian is\np+q\nL\n.\nH = H0 \u2212\np\n\n(A.4)\n\nHere \u03bb = M + \u03c9 + \u03a9 is the mean longitude of the particle\nalong its orbit; \u03bb\u2032 is the same for the planet; \u031f = \u03c9 + \u03a9\nis the longitude of periastron. These variables are introduced\nby Morbidelli & Moons (1993) and Moons (1994). The angle \u03c3 is often called the \"critical angle of the resonance\"\n(Moons & Morbidelli 1995). Resonant orbits are characterised\nby a libration of \u03c3 around a stable position.\nThe secular dynamics is investigated by performing a\ntime-averaging of H over the only remaining fast variable,\n\u03bb\u2032 . If the orbit of the planet is circular, then the averaged\nHamiltonian turns out to be independent of \u03bd, showing that\nN is a secular constant of motion (Morbidelli & Moons 1993;\nMoons & Morbidelli 1995). This can be checked with explicit\nexpressions, but this arises from the d'Alembert rules : \u03c3 and\n\u03c3z are independent of any axis rotation within the orbital plane\nof the planet, while this is not the case for \u03bd. If the planet's\norbit is circular, the whole Hamiltonian is expected to be invariant for any rotation in that plane, and should consequently\nnot depend on \u03bd. In that case, the Hamiltonian has two degrees\nof freedom. If we restrict our study to planar motion, then the\nvariables \u03c3z and S z disappear and the averaged Hamiltonian\nis integrable. The secular motion is characterised, together\nwith the librations of \u03c3, by coupled oscillations in the (a, e)\nplane around the equilibrium value, along a curve N = cst.\nThis dynamics is described for many specific resonances by\nMorbidelli & Moons (1993); Moons & Morbidelli (1995).\nIf the orbit of the planet is not circular, the action N is no\nlonger constant. It is thus able to evolve, but on a much longer\ntime-scale than the main librations of \u03c3. Therefore, on a short\ntime-scale the oscillations in (a, e) space are preserved, but on a\n\n15\n\nlonger time-scale, the value of N is subject to changes that may\ndrive the eccentricity to high values. As quoted by Yoshikawa\n(1989), these changes are particularly important for resonances\n4:1, 3:1 and 5:2. Beust & Morbidelli (1996) showed that the\n4:1 resonance is a potential source of FEBs via this mechanism,\nand Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001) show that the 3:1 resonance may\nalso contribute to the FEB phenomenon.\nIf we return to the spatial problem and give an initially moderate inclination to the particle, these dynamics are preserved. In fact all the simulations presented in\nBeust & Morbidelli (2000) and Th\u00e9bault & Beust (2001) were\nthree-dimensional, and the behaviour reported was in perfect\nagreement with the planar description. However, the planar\nmodel does not describe the inclination oscillations observed\nwhenever the eccentricity reaches high values. In order to explain them, we must consider the spatial problem as a whole.\nTo further study the problem, Morbidelli & Moons (1993)\nintroduce the following canonically conjugate action-angle\nvariables :\n1\n2\u03c0\n, J\u03c3 =\n\u03c8\u03c3 =\nT\u03c3\n2\u03c0\n\u03c8z = \u03c3z \u2212 \u03c1z (\u03c8\u03c3 , J\u03c3 , Jz , J\u03bd ) , Jz = S z\n\nI\n\nS d\u03c3\n,\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u03c8\u03bd = \u03bd \u2212 \u03c1\u03bd (\u03c8\u03c3 , J\u03c3 , Jz , J\u03bd ) , J\u03bd = N\nwhere T \u03c3 is the libration period of \u03c3, t is the time, and J\u03c3 is\ncomputed over one libration cycle of \u03c3. \u03c1\u03bd and \u03c1z are functions\nthat are periodic with zero average in \u03c8\u03c3 .\nWe are interested in the secular dynamics inside the resonance; hence we perform a second averaging of H over \u03c8\u03c3 .\nThe function \u03c1\u03bd and \u03c1z disappear then and J\u03c3 is a new secular constant of motion. J\u03c3 is the normalised area enclosed by\nthe libration trajectory in (S , \u03c3) space. It is close to the amplitude of the libration in \u03c3. Thus in the non-circular problem, the\nvalue of N may change, but the amplitude of the libration is\nroughly preserved. Curves of J\u03c3 = cst for various resonances\nare given in Morbidelli & Moons (1993); Moons & Morbidelli\n(1995).\nThe inclination oscillations are related to the coupled evolution of \u03c8z and Jz . This is not easy to describe in the general\ncase as the Hamiltonian H, even averaged over \u03c8\u03c3 , is still not\nintegrable, as depending on several angles, and because the relationship between \u03c8z , \u03bd and J\u03c3 and the usual orbital elements\nis not straightforward. A convenient way to investigate the dynamics is to restrict the study to the case J\u03c3 = 0, i.e., orbits with\nnegligible libration amplitude. In this case, the semi-major axis\na assumes a fixed value (the pericentric equilibrium) close to\nthe unperturbed value of the resonance; \u03c3 also is fixed to an\nequilibrium value \u03c30 . The value of \u03c30 depends on the resonance under consideration. It is then easy to show that under\nthese conditions \u03c8z = \u03c3z = \u03c30 + \u03c9. This method of considering zero amplitude libration was used in Beust & Morbidelli\n(1996) to draw Hamiltonian maps in the planar problem.\nIf we consider the circular (but non-planar) problem, the\nsecular Hamiltonian H, once averaged over \u03c8\u03c3 , has only one\ndegree on freedom left. It is a function of \u03c8z and Jz , or alternatively of i and \u03c9, the constant value of N acting as a parameter.\n\n\f16\n\nBeust and Valiron: High latitude gas in the \u03b2 Pictoris system\n\nAppendix B: The drag force theory\nGiven the interaction potential U(r) (the potential energy being\n\u03bcU(r)), the encounter between a Ca ii ion and an H i atom may\nbe studied using energy and momentum conservation :\n\u0011\n1\n1\u0010 2\n\u1e59 + r\u03b8\u03072 + U(r) = v2\n2\n2\nr2 \u03b8\u0307 = bv\n\n;\n\n(B.1)\n(B.2)\n\n,\n\nwhere the relative motion is described by its polar coordinates\n(r, \u03b8), v is the incoming velocity, b is the impact parameter, and\n\u1e59 and \u03b8\u0307 are as usual shorthands for dr/dt and d\u03b8/dt.

This is done demanding \u1e592 = g(rm ) = 0 in\nthe preceding equation. There may be no root for rm . Let us for\nexample consider the dipole induced potential U(r) = V(r)/\u03bc\nwhere V(r) is taken from Eq. (4). The resulting equation for\nrm is quadratic, and it is a matter of straightforward algebra\nto show that a root exists only if b \u2265 b0 , where b0 is given\nby Eq. (6). In the opposite case, the distance is expected to\ndecrease to zero. However, with a more realistic potential presenting a repulsive core at small distance, there will always be\na root for rm : at infinity, Eq. (B.3) gives g(r) = v2 > 0 while at\nsmall distance, as U(r) > 0, obviously Eq.

All the computations presented in this paper\nwere performed at the Service Commun de Calcul Intensif de\nl'Observatoire de Grenoble (SCCI). Comments by our referee, V.\nGrinin, and by the Editor, M. Walmsley, inspired the emission model\npresented in Sect 2.\n\nReferences\n(B.8)\n\nThis last expression is of practical interest to numerically compute \u03c7 for any potential: \u01eb(b, v, y) has a finite\np limit towards\ny \u2192 1, so that the presence of the kernel 1/ 1 \u2212 y2 allows a\nrapid computation using a Gauss-Chebychev quadrature technique.\n\nArtymowicz P., 1997, Ann.
