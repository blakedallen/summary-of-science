Uniquely to this system, the dominance of quantum over classical capacitance in\nthe charge transfer between the substrate and graphene is such that Landau levels (in particular,\nthe one at exactly zero energy) remain completely filled over an extraordinarily broad range of\nmagnetic fields. One important implication of this pinning of the filling factor is that the system\ncan sustain a very high nondissipative current. This makes epitaxial graphene ideally suited for\nquantum resistance metrology, and we have achieved a precision of 3 parts in 1010 in the Hall\nresistance quantization measurements.\nPACS numbers: 73.43.-f,72.80.Vp,06.20.F-\n\nThe quantum Hall effect (QHE) is one of the key fundamental phenomena in solid-state physics [1]. It was\nobserved in two-dimensional electron systems in semiconductor materials and, since recently, in graphene: both in\nexfoliated [2\u20134] and epitaxial [5\u20139] devices. A direct highaccuracy comparison of the conventional QHE in semiconductors with that observed in graphene constitutes a\ntest of the universality of this effect. The affirmative result would strongly support the pending redefinition of\nthe SI units based on the Planck constant h and the electron charge e [10] and provide an international resistance\nstandard based upon quantum physics [11].\nGraphene is believed to offer an excellent platform for\nQHE metrology due to the large energy separation between Landau levels (LL) resulting from the Dirac-type\n\"massless\" electrons specific for its band structure [12].\nThe Hall resistance quantization with an accuracy of 3\nparts in 109 has already been established [7] in Hall-bar\ndevices manufactured from epitaxial graphene grown on\nSi-terminated face of SiC (SiC/G). However, for graphene\nto be practically employed as an embodiment of a quantum resistance standard, it needs to satisfy further stringent requirements [11], in particular with respect to robustness over a range of temperature, magnetic field\nand measurement current. A high measurement current,\nwhich a device can sustain at a given temperature without dissipation, is particularly important for precision\nmetrology as it defines the maximum attainable signalto-noise ratio.\nThe extent of the QHE plateaux in conventional 2D\nelectron systems is, usually, set by disorder and temperature. Disorder pins the Fermi energy in the mobility gap\nof the 2D system, which suppresses dissipative transport\nat low temperatures over a finite range of magnetic fields\naround the values corresponding to exactly filled LLs.\n\nThese values can be calculated from the carrier density\nns determined from the low-field Hall resistivity measurements and coincide with the maximum non-dissipative\ncurrent, the breakdown current. Thus, the breakdown\ncurrent in conventional two-dimensional semicondutors\npeaks very close to the field values where the filling factor \u03bd is an even integer [11]. Though less studied experimentally, the behaviour of the breakdown current on\nthe plateaux for the exfoliated graphene, including the\n\u03bd = 2 plateau corresponding to the topologically protected N = 0 LL, looks quite similar [13].\nIn this Brief Report we explore the robustness of the\nHall resistance quantization in SiC/G. Unlike the QHE\nin conventional 2D systems, where the carrier density is\nindependent of magnetic field, here specifically to SiC/G,\nwe find that the carrier density in graphene varies with\nmagnetic field due to the charge transfer between surface\ndonor states in SiC and graphene. Most importantly, we\nfind magnetic field intervals of several Tesla, where the\ncarrier density in graphene increases linearly with the\nmagnetic field, resulting in the pinning of \u03bd = 2 state\nwith electrons at the the chemical potential occupying\nSiC surface donor states half-way between the N = 0\nand N = 1 LLs in graphene. Interestingly, at magnetic\nfields above the \u03bd = 2 filling factor pinning interval, the\ncarrier density saturates at a value up to 30% higher\nthan the zero-field carrier density. The pinned filling factor manifests itself in a continuously increasing breakdown current toward the upper magnetic field end of the\n\u03bd = 2 state far beyond the nominal value of B\u03bd=2 calculated from the zero-field carrier density. Facilitated by\nthe high breakdown current in excess of 500 \u03bcA at 14 T\nwe have achieved a precision of 3 parts in 1010 in the Hall\nresistance quantization measurements.\nThe anomalous pinning of \u03bd = 4N + 2 filling factors in\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b3[A \u2212 4\u03c0e2 d(ns + ng ) \u2212 \u03b5F ] = ns + ng .\n\n(1)\n\nThe left hand side of this equation accounts for the depletion of the surface donor states, where A is the difference\nbetween the work function of undoped graphene and the\nwork function of electrons in the surface donors in SiC,\n\u03b5F is the Fermi energy of electrons in graphene, and \u03b3 is\nthe density of donor states in the dead layer.

The latter reside in the 'dead\nlayer' of carbon atoms, just underneath\n[15\u201320].\n\u221a\n\u221a graphene\nThis layer is characterised by a 6 3 \u00d7 6 3 supercell of\nthe reconstructed surface of sublimated SiC. Missing or\nsubstituted carbon atoms in various positions of such a\nhuge supercell in the dead layer create localised surface\nstates with a broad distribution of energies within the\nbandgap of SiC (\u2248 2.4 eV).\nIt appears that the density of such defects is higher\nin material grown at low temperatures (1200 \u2212 1600\u25e6C)\nresulting in graphene doped to a large electron density,\nns \u223c 1013 cm\u22122 , which is difficult to change [21]. On the\nother hand, growth at higher temperatures, T \u2248 2000\u25e6C,\nand in a highly pressurised atmosphere of Ar seems to\nimprove the integrity of the reconstructed 'dead' layer,\nleading to a lower density of donors on the surface and,\ntherefore, producing graphene with a much lower initial\ndoping [7, 22].\nThe quantum capacitance of a two-dimensional electron system is the result of a low compressibility of the\nelectron liquid determined by the peaks in \u03b3e . For electrons in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in\nmagnetic field, the quantum capacitance manifests itself in weak magneto-oscillations of the electron density\n[23, 24] due to the suppressed density of states inside\nthe inter-Landau level gaps. A similarly weak effect has\nbeen observed in graphene exfoliated onto n-Si/SiO2 substrate [25], where the influence of a larger (than in usual\nsemiconductors) inter-LL gaps is hindered by a strong\ncharging effect determined by a relatively large thickness\nof SiO2 layer. For epitaxial graphene on SiC, due to\nthe short distance, d \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.4 nm, between the dead\nlayer hosting the donors and graphene, the effect of quantum capacitance is much stronger, and the oscillations\nof electron density take the form of the robust pinning\nof the electron filling factor. A similar behaviour was\nobserved in STM spectroscopy of turbostratic graphite,\nwhere charge is transferred between the top graphene\nlayer and the underlying bulk layers [26]. The charge\ntransfer in SiC/G is illustrated in the sketches in Fig. 1,\nfor B = 0 (a) and quantising magnetic fields (b). The\ntransfer can be described using the charge balance equation [21]\n\nN\n\n=\n\n-1\n\nB\n\nIII\n\n-2\n\neV cm\n\nB\n\n=2\n\nIII\n\nII\n\nI,h\n\n1\n\n=2\n\nd)\n\n3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nB (T)\n\nFIG. 1.

For graphene within\ninterval III (visible only in the case of the higher ng )\nthe Fermi energy coincides with the partially filled zeroenergy LL, \u03b5F = 0, which determines the carrier density n\u221e = 1+eA\u03b3\n\u2212 ng , and can be up to 30% higher\n2 \u03b3/c\nc\nthan the zero-field density ns (0) in the same device [21].\nThis regime of fixed electron density is terminated at\nthe low field end, at BIII = hn\u221e /2e, where the N = 0\nLL is completely occupied by electrons with the density\nn\u221e .

In magnetic field interval II the chemical\npotential in the system lies inside the gap between N = 0\nand N = 1 LL in graphene. As a result, over this entire\ninterval the N = 0 LL in graphene is full and N = 1 is\nempty, so that the filling factor in graphene is fixed at\nthe value \u03bd = 2, and the carrier density increases linearly\nwith the magnetic field, ns = 2eB/h, due to the charge\ntransfer from SiC surface.\nAccording to Eq. 1, lowering the carrier density using\nan electrostatic gate is equivalent to effectively reducing\nthe work function difference between graphene and donor\nstates by ng (1/\u03b3 + e2 /cc ), which shifts the range of the\nmagnetic fields where pinning of the \u03bd = 2 state takes\nplace. For instance, reducing the zero-field carrier density\nfrom ns = 6.7 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 [Fig. 1(c)] to ns = 4.6 \u00d7\n1011 cm\u22122 [Fig. 1 (d)] moves interval II from 11.5 T <\nBII < 21.6 T down to 7.7 T < BII < 15.9 T, almost\nentirely within the experimental range.\nIn order to verify the predictions of the theory regarding the pinning of the \u03bd = 2 filling factor and its implications for the resistance metrology, we studied the QHE in\na polymer-gated epitaxial graphene sample with Hall bar\ngeometry of width W = 35 \u03bcm and length L = 160 \u03bcm.\nGraphene was grown at 2000\u25e6C and 1 atm Ar gas pressure on the Si-terminated face of a semi-insulating 4HSiC(0001) substrate. The as-grown sample had the zerofield carrier density ns = 1.1 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 . Graphene\nwas encapsulated in a polymer bilayer, a spacer polymer\nfollowed by an active polymer able to generate acceptor\nlevels under UV light. At room temperature electrons\ndiffuse from graphene through the spacer polymer layer\nand fill the acceptor levels in the top polymer layer. Such\na photo-chemical gate allowed non-volatile control over\nthe charge carrier density in graphene. More fabrication\ndetails can be found elsewhere [7, 22].\nFigure 2(a) shows magneto transport measurements on\nthe encapsulated sample tuned to a zero-field carrier density of ns = 6.7 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 corresponding to the case\nin fig. 1(c)]. From the carrier density we estimate that\nthe magnetic field B\u03bd=2 needed for exact filling factor\n\u03bd = 2 in this device is 13.8 T. A well-quantized Hall\nplateau in \u03c1xy can be seen at \u03bd = \u00b12 for both magnetic\nfield directions which is more than 5 T wide, whereas the\nlongitudinal resistivity, \u03c1xx , drops to zero signifying a\nnon-dissipative state. In addition, a less precisely quantized plateau is present at \u03bd = \u00b16, for which \u03c1xx remains\nfinite.\nAccurate quantum Hall resistance measurements require that the longitudinal voltage remains zero (in prac-\n\n-10\n0\n\n-20\n11.0\n\n11.5\n\n12.0\n\n12.5\n\n13.0\n\n13.5\n\n14.0\n\nB (T)\n\nFIG. 2.

All error bars are 1\u03c3.\n\ntice, below the noise level of the nanovolt meter) to ensure\nthe device is in the non-dissipative state, which can be\nviolated by the breakdown of the QHE at high current.\nFigure 2(b) shows the determination of the breakdown\ncurrent Ic at B = 14 T on the \u03bd = 2 plateau. Here\nwe define Ic as the source-drain current, Isd , at which\nVxx \u2265 10 nV. We find for three different combinations of\nsource-drain current contacts that the breakdown current\nfor this value of ns is approximately 50 \u03bcA (note that Isd\nin a practical quantum Hall to 100 \u03a9 resistance measurement is \u2248 25 \u03bcA [27]). The contact resistance, determined via a three-terminal measurement in the nondissipative state, is smaller than 1.5 \u03a9.\nFigure 2(c) shows a precision measurement of \u03c1xy and\n\u03c1xx for different magnetic fields along the \u03bd = 2 plateau.\nNote that this plateau appears much shorter in the magnetic field range than that shown in Fig. 2 (a) because\nof the 200 times larger measurement current used in\nprecision measurements.

This result represents an order of magnitude improvement of QHE precision measurements in\ngraphene, as compared to the earlier record [7]. Not only\nis QHE accurate, but it is also extremely robust in this\nepitaxial graphene device, easily meeting the stringent\ncriteria for accurate quantum Hall resistance measurements normally applied to semiconductor systems.\nUsing the polymer gating method [22], we further reduce the zero-field electron density ns in graphene to correspond to the solution of the charge transfer problem in\nFig. 1(d), i.e. down to 4.6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 as evidenced\nby magnetotransport measurements in Fig. 3(a). On the\n\u03bd = 2 quantum Hall resistance plateau we measure the\nbreakdown current Ic , defined above, as a function of\nthe magnetic field. Unlike the conventional QHE materials [11], the breakdown current in Fig. 3(a) continuously increases from zero to almost 500 \u03bcA far beyond\nB\u03bd=2 \u223c 9.5 T calculated from the zero-field carrier density. This is a direct consequence of the exchange of carriers between graphene and the donors in the 'dead' layer,\nwhich keeps the N = 0 LL completely filled well past\nB\u03bd=2 .\nThe magnetic field range where the Fermi energy in\nSiC/G lies half-way between the p\nN = 0 and 1 LLs determines the activation energy h\u0304 1/2v/\u03bbB \u223c 1000 K\nfor the dissipative transport. For such a high activation energy, the low-temperature dissipative transport is\nmost likely to proceed through the variable range hopping (VRH) between surface donors in SiC involving virtual occupancy of the LL states in graphene to which\n\nthey are weakly coupled. Indeed, as shown in the inset\nof Fig. 3(b), the temperature dependence of thep\nconductivity \u03c3xx measured at B = 13 T obeys an exp(\u2212 T \u2217 /T )\ndependence typical of the VRH mechanism. The T \u2217 values determined from the measurements at different magnetic fields are plotted in the main panel of fig. 3(b). The\nbreakdown current rising with field to very large values\n[Fig. 3(a)] corresponds to T \u2217 reaching extremely large\nvalues in excess of 104 K \u2013 at least an order of magnitude larger than that observed in GaAs [28] and more\nrecently in exfoliated graphene [13, 29].\nIn conclusion, we have studied the robust Hall resistance quantization in a large epitaxial graphene sample\ngrown on SiC. We have observed the pinning of the \u03bd = 2\nstate which is consistent with our picture of magnetic\nfield dependent charge transfer between the SiC surface\nand graphene layer. Together with the large break-down\ncurrent this makes graphene on SiC the ideal system for\nhigh-precision resistance metrology.\nWe are grateful to T. Seyller, A. Geim, K.
