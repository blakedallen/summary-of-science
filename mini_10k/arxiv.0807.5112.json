A relation between the neutrino angle \u03b813 and the\natmospheric neutrino angle is obtained.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe masses of the known quarks and leptons exhibit a large hierarchy. This has suggested to many theorists\n[1] that the light fermion mass hierarchy could be \"radiative\", i.e. that the lightest fermions get mass from loop\ndiagrams, while the heaviest get mass at tree level. In the early 1980's several papers showed that such an idea\ncan be implemented naturally in the context of non-supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs) [2]. In models of\nthis type, the radiative masses come from loop diagrams containing virtual GUT-scale particles. That is why such\n2\n2\nmodels must be non-supersymmetric: otherwise, the loops would be suppressed by O(MSUSY\n/MGUT\n) due to the\nnon-renormalization theorems of supersymmetry.\nIn a recent paper [3] a very simple non-supersymmetric SO(10) model with a radiative hierarchy was proposed.\nOne thing that allows this model to be so simple is precisely that its hierarchy is radiative. The point is that terms\nhave to exist in the lagrangian corresponding to the larger elements of the quark and lepton mass matrices, but not\nto the smallest elements, since they arise automatically from loops. The simplification can be seen by comparing the\nmodel of [3] to the supersymmetric SO(10) model on which it was based, which had a non-radiative hierarchy [4].\nThat earlier model had a somewhat larger particle content and more Yukawa terms.\nModels with radiative hierarchies are also simpler in another way: in them it is not necessary to introduce ad\nhoc very small dimensionless parameters to account for the fermion mass hierarchies, since they are automatically\naccounted for by the loop factors 1/16\u03c0 2 . Despite radiative hierarchy models being able to have a simpler structure,\none might think they would be less predictive, since loop diagrams tend to depend on many parameters. However,\nthe model proposed in [3] shows that this need not be the case. In that paper it was shown that the model gives a\nqualitatively realistic pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixings with only 9 parameters.\nWhile the non-supersymmetric model proposed in [3] is economical and qualitatively realistic, the analysis in that\npaper was not sufficient to establish that it is realistic quantitatively. In particular, several issues were not addressed.\nFirst, it was not specified what the sequence and scales of breaking were of SO(10) down to the Standard Model group\nGSM (which must, of course be consistent with proton decay bounds and unification of gauge couplings). Unless that\nis done, the renormalization-group running of the quark and lepton masses needed for a global fit of parameters cannot\nbe performed. Second, the forms of the mass matrices given [3] were derived under the assumption that certain SU (5)breaking effects could be ignored. However, as will be seen, this assumption is not necessarily consistent with the\npattern of SO(10) breaking that needs to be assumed in order to satisfy the constraints of gauge coupling unification\nand proton decay. SU (5)-breaking effects will turn out to modify significantly the forms of the quark and lepton mass\nmatrices given in [3]. Third, the mb /m\u03c4 ratio is problematic in the version of the model discussed in [3]. In that\nmodel, because certain SU (5)-breaking effects were treated as negligible, the classic prediction m0b \u223c\n= m0\u03c4 was obtained.\n(A superscript '0' indicates throughout this paper quantities evaluated at the GUT scale.) This is well-known to give\na fairly good fit in supersymmetric models for certain values of tan \u03b2 [5]; but in non-supersymmetric models it results\nin a prediction of mb /m\u03c4 at low energies that is typically too large by at least 30% [6]. Fourth, the ratio ms /mb\nis predicted in the version of the model given in to have the Georgi-Jarlskog value 13 m\u03bc /m\u03c4 at the GUT scale [7].\nHowever, lattice calculations [8] have suggested that ms is significantly smaller than previous estimates of it, and the\nbest fit value is now somewhat smaller than the Georgi-Jarlskog prediction.\nIn this paper, we address all these issues. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the SO(10) model of [3]\nis reviewed, and it is explained how both the tree-level and radiative contributions to the mass matrices arise, and\nwhy the resulting forms give a good qualitative description of the pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixings. In\nsection 3, a breaking of SO(10) down to the Standard Model consistent with gauge coupling unification and proton\ndecay bounds is specified. In section 4, the effect of this pattern of symmetry breaking on the quark and lepton mass\n\n\f2\nmatrices is discussed and it is shown that forms somewhat different from those given in [3] result. In section 5, the\nresults of a global numerical fit to the quark and lepton masses and mixings is given. An excellent fit is found to the\nquark and lepton masses and mixings, including the CP phase \u03b4CKM . A relation between the neutrino angle \u03b813 and\nthe atmospheric neutrino angle is obtained.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe model proposed in [3], whose predictions we analyze in detail in this paper, is a non-supersymmetric with\nunified group SO(10). In it the tree-level mass matrices of quarks and charged leptons are generated by only three\neffective Yukawa operators\nO1 = 163 163 10H\nO2 = 162 163 10H 45H /MGUT\nO3 = (ci 16i 16iH )(163 16\u2032H )/MGUT , i = 1, 2\n\n(1)\n\nIn O3 , the factors in parentheses are contracted into 10's of SO(10). The loop-level elements in the mass matrices\narise very simply from the tree-level elements, as will be seen later. The three operators given in Eq. (1) do the\nfollowing things: O1 gives the 33 elements of the mass matrices, i.e. the masses of the third family. O2 and O3\ngenerate the masses of the second family and its mixing with the third family (i.e. Vcb and \u03b8atm ), and also \u03b8sol . The\nmasses of the first family and its mixings come from loops.\nThe operators in Eq. (1) come from integrating out some \"extra\" vectorlike fermion multiplets, consisting of an\nSO(10) vector and a spinor-antispinor pair. Thus the complete fermionic content of the model comprises the following\n(left-handed) multiplets: 16i=1,2,3 + (16 + 16 + 10). The Dirac mass matrices of the up-type quarks, down-type\nquarks, charged leptons, and neutrinos (denoted by MU , MD , ML , and MN , respectively) arise from the following set\nof Yukawa terms in the lagrangian:\nLY uk = M16 (16 16) + M10 (10 10).\n+ a(16 163 )45H +\n\nP\n\ni=1,2 ci (10\n\n16i )16iH\n(2)\n\n+ h33 (163 163 )10H + h2 (16 162 )10H + h3 (10 163 )16\u2032H\n+ h(16 16)10\u2032H .\nIt is shown in [3] that this form of the Yukawa interactions is the most general allowed by a certain simple U (1) flavor\nsymmetry, which will be denoted by U (1)F . The terms on the first line of Eq. (2) are the O(MGUT ) masses of the\nextra fermion multiplets; the terms on the second line contribute O(MGUT ) masses that mix those extra fermions with\nthe three chiral families 16i ; the terms on the third line generate the weak-scale SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y -breaking masses;\nand the last term is needed to give radiative masses to the first family. Higgs multiplets are denoted by the subscript\nH. The Higgs fields 16iH obtain vacuum expectation values (VEV) in the 1(16) direction. (The expression p(q)\nstands for a p multiplet of SU (5) contained in a q multiplet of SO(10).) The adjoint Higgs field 45H is assumed to\nobtain a VEV that is proportional to the SO(10) generator B \u2212 L (i.e. baryon number minus lepton number).\nThe electroweak gauge symmetry SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y is spontaneously broken by the Higgs multiplets denoted 10H ,\n10\u2032H , and 16\u2032H in Eq. (1), and, more specifically, by the neutral components of the Y /2 = \u22121/2 doublets contained\nin 5(10H ), 5(10\u2032H ), and 5(16\u2032H ), and the neutral components of the Y /2 = +1/2 doublets contained in 5(10H ) and\n5(10\u2032H ). Of course, in the low-energy effective theory, which is just the Standard Model, there is only one Higgs\ndoublet, which is some linear combination of these doublets (and their hermitian conjugates).\nAccording to [3], the mass matrices that result from the terms in Eq. (2) have the form\n\uf8f6\n0 0 0\nMU = \uf8ed 0 0 3\u01eb \uf8f8 mU ,\n0 \u2212 3\u01eb 1\n\uf8eb\n\nMN\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0 0\n= \uf8ed 0 0 \u2212\u01eb \uf8f8 mU ,\n0 \u01eb 1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n0\n\u03b4H\nMD = \uf8ed 0\nC1 C2 \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\n\u01eb\n3\n\n\u01eb\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03b4g1\n+ \u03b4g2 \uf8f8 mD ,\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\nC1\n\u03b4H\nC2 \u2212 \u01eb \uf8f8 mD ,\nML = \uf8ed 0\n\u03b4g1 \u01eb + \u03b4g2\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nwhere mU \u2261 h33 h5(10H )i and mD \u2261 h33 h5(10H )i. (It will be seen in section 4 that GUT-symmetry-breaking effects\nmodify these forms somewhat.) The convention here is that the mass matrices are multiplied from the left by the\nleft-handed fermions and from the right by the right-handed fermions.\nThe 33 elements of the mass matrices in Eq. (3) come simply from the term h33 (163 163 )10H , as is usually the\ncase in SO(10) models [9]. (This is just the operator O1 in Eq. (1).)\nThe contributions to the 23 and 32 elements denoted by \u01eb come from integrating out the family-antifamily pair\n16 + 16. The antifamily 16 appears in two mass terms from Eq. (2), which can be combined as follows: 16(M16 16 +\nah45H i163 ). These terms have the effect of mixing the 16 with the 163 . One linear combination of 16 and 163\nobtains an O(MGUT ) mass, while the orthogonal combination (denoted by the index 3\u2032 ) remains light. (From now\non, primed indices will be used to denote the light families that remain after the superheavy fermions have been\nintegrated out.) Thus, the 16 with no index has some of the third light family mixed in with it; and the amount of\nthis mixing is proportional to the VEV h45H i. As a result, the term h2 (16 162 )10H from Eq. (2) leads to an effective\noperator of the form (163\u2032 162\u2032 )10H 45H /MGUT , which is just the operator O2 of Eq. (1), which in turn produces the\ncontributions denoted in Eq. (3) by \u01eb. Since h45H i \u221d B \u2212 L, the \u01eb contributions are 1/3 times as large for the quarks\nas for the leptons.\nThe elements denoted by C1 and C2 arise in a similar fashion by integrating out the SO(10)-vector multiplet of\nquarks and leptons, 10. This multiplet contains a 5P\n+ 5 of SU (5). The 5(10) appears in several mass terms from Eq.\n(2), which can be combined as 5(10)[M10 5(10) + i=1,2 ci h1(16iH )i5(16i )]. These terms have the effect of mixing\nthe 5(10) with the 5(161 ) and 5(162 ). One linear combination of these 5's obtains an O(MGUT ) mass, while the two\northogonal linear combinations are in the light families and denoted 51\u2032 and 52\u2032 . Consequently, the 5(10) has mixed\nin with it some of 51\u2032 and 52\u2032 . That means that the term h3 (10 163 )16\u2032H in Eq. (2) leads to effective mass terms\nof the form (C1 51\u2032 + C2 52\u2032 )103\u2032 mD . This is just the operator O3 of Eq. (1) and gives the terms denoted by the Ci\nin Eq. (3). These contributions appear only in ML and MD , because 5's of SU (5) contain only charged leptons and\ndown-type quarks. In both [4] and [3] the M10 was assumed to be an explicit (and therefore SU (5)-invariant) mass,\nand therefore the same Ci appear in both ML and MD .\nAt this point it should be noted that the expressions for the\ngiven in Eq. (3) are\np quark and lepton mass matrices\np\nP\napproximate. The exact expressions involve factors, such as 1/ 1 + (ah45H i/M16 )2 and 1/ 1 + ( i ci h16iH i/M10 )2 ,\nwhich are essentially just the cosines of angles describing the mixing between the extra fermions 16 + 16 + 10 and the\nthree chiral families 16i . If these mixing angles are small, their cosines are very close to one, and the mass matrices\nbecome insensitive to their values. This is an assumption that we make here (as in [3]), as it reduces the number of\nparameters. However, there is no a priori reason to assume that these angles are extremely small. (Indeed, if they\nvanished, so would \u01eb.) If one of these angles were of order 0.25 radians, say, it would give 3% corrections to some of\nthe elements of the mass matrices.\nThe elements denoted by \u03b4gi and \u03b4H in Eq. (3) are necessary to make the mass matrices ML and MD be of rank 3\nrather than rank 2, and so generate masses and mixings for the first family. As will be seen, in order to fit the first\nfamily masses and mixings these \u03b4 are must be of order 10\u22122 , whereas the other parameters appearing inside in the\nmass matrices in Eq. (3) turn out to be of order 1 (or, in the case of \u01eb, about 0.19). In [4], additional vectorlike quark\nand lepton fields besides those in Eq. (2) had to be introduced in order to generate these small \u03b4's. In [3], however,\nit was noted that that the terms in Eq. (2) are enough to generate the \u03b4 terms automatically by one-loop diagrams\nand also to explain why they are of order 10\u22122 .\nThe \u03b4gi terms are given by the one-gauge-boson-loop diagram shown in Fig. 1(a). The gauge boson in this diagram\nis in a 10 of SU (5) (of course, it is in the adjoint 45 of SO(10)), so that it turns 10's of SU (5) into 5's and vice\nversa. That means that the small \u03b4gi elements that couple 10i to 53 (namely (MD )i3 and (ML )3i ) come from the\nlarge Ci elements that couple 5i to 103 (namely (ML )i3 and (MD )3i ) So \u03b4gi \u221d Ci . These diagrams were evaluated in\n[3] neglecting certain SU (5)-breaking effects, giving the result that the same \u03b4gi appear in ML and MD , as given in\nEq.

The diagram in (a) shows how a tree-level mass for 103 5i (shown as a blob in the center) leads to a\none-loop mass for 10i 53 : i.e. the \u03b4gi elements arise radiatively from the Ci elements. The 10(45g ) in the loop is a\nsuperheavy gauge boson. The diagram in (b) is more detailed and shows why the loop is finite.\n\nThe diagram in Fig 1(a) superficially looks divergent. However, the accidental symmetry U (1)F of the terms in\nEq. (1) makes (MD )13 and (ML )31 vanish at tree level and guarantees that the loop is finite, as an exact calculation\nindeed shows. The finiteness of this diagram is more obvious if we write it in the form shown in Fig. 1(b). The\ncalculation of these loops will be discussed in section 4.\nThe 22 elements of ML and MD (denoted \u03b4H ) arise from the one-Higgs-boson-loop diagram shown in Fig. 2.\nWhereas the one-gauge-boson-loop shown in Fig. 1 must exist if the tree-level masses in Eq. (3) exist, the diagram\nin Fig. 2 only exists if certain couplings not needed for the tree-level masses are present: namely, the last term in\nEq. (2) (h(16 16) 10\u2032H ) and a Higgs-mass term of the form 10H 10H . A diagram related by SO(10) to the one in\nFig. 2 gives a 22 element for the up-quark mass matrix MU . However, if one supposes the contributions to (MU )22\nand (MD )22 from these diagrams to be roughly comparable, then (MU )22 /(MU )33 would be of order 10\u22124 and thus\nat most a few percent correction to mc .\n\n\f5\n\n5(10H )\n\u271b\n\u272c\n\u2732\n10(162 )\n\n\u271b\n10(16)\n\nt\n\n5(10H )\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\u2744 10(16)\n\n\u2729\n\u271b\n5(162 )\n\nh5(10\u2032H )i\n\nFigure 2. A diagram showing how the 22 elements of the mass matrices can arise radiatively through Higgs-boson\nloops.\n\nBefore getting into a more detailed discussion of the model, it is useful to explain how the structure of the matrices\ngiven in Eq. (3) explains qualitatively many of the features of the observed pattern of masses and mixings of the\nquarks and leptons.\nFirst, neglecting the \u03b4 parameters (which are of order 10\u22122 because they come from one-loop diagrams) and the\nparameter \u01eb (which, though a tree-level effect, is somewhat\nsmaller than 1), one has that all the mass matrices in Eq.\np\n0 \u223c\n0 \u223c\n(3) are of rank 1. In this approximation, mb = m\u03c4 = 1 + |C1 |2 + |C2 |2 , where the superscript '0' denotes quantities\nevaluated at the GUT scale. The relation m0b \u223c\n= m0\u03c4 is known to fit fairly well in supersymmetric grand unified models\nwith certain values of tan \u03b2. It works less well in non-supersymmetric grand unified models; however, this relation\nwill be substatially modified when realistic symmetry breaking is taken into account in section 4.\nThe large (i.e. O(1)) off-diagonal elements Ci produce large mixing angles in the left-handed lepton sector and\nthe right-handed quark sector. This is because they result from mixings of 5's of SU (5), which contain, of course,\nleft-handed charged leptons and right-handed down-type quarks. Consequently, these elements produce large MNS\nneutrino mixing angles, but they do not produce large CKM mixing, since CKM mixing is of the left-handed not\nright-handed quarks. This is one of the basic ideas of so-called \"lopsided\" models [10].\nMoreover, the present model is \"doubly lopsided\" in the sense that both C1 and C2 are large [11]. (In singly lopsided\nmodels C2 is large but not C1 .) This doubly lopsided structure can give a very simple explanation of the \"bi-large\"\npattern of neutrino mixing angles in the following way. Diagonalizing the charged-lepton mass matrix ML requires\nO(1) rotations to eliminate the elements C1 andpC2 . In particular, it requires a rotation by \u03b8s = tan\u22121 (C1 /C2 ) in the\n1-2 plane followed by a rotation by \u03b8a = tan\u22121 |C1 |2 + |C2 |2 in the 2-3 plane. If, as here, the neutrino mass matrix\nis hierarchical, then the rotations required to diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix ML give the dominant\ncontributions to the MNS matrix, which is therefore approximately of the form\n\nUMN S\n\n\uf8f6\ncs\nss\n0\n= \uf8ed \u2212ca ss ca cs sa \uf8f8 ,\nsa ss \u2212sa cs ca\n\uf8eb\n\n(4)\n\nwhere sa \u2261 sin \u03b8a , ca \u2261 cos \u03b8a , ss \u2261 sin \u03b8s , and cs \u2261 cos \u03b8s . This is the bi-large form, with \u03b8s being the solar neutrino\nangle and \u03b8a being the atmospheric angle. When the effects of the small parameters \u01eb and the \u03b4's are taken into\naccount, there will be small shifts in UMN S , including a small non-zero \u03b813 , which will be calculated in section 5.\nIf one considers the effects of \u01eb, but still neglects the the \u03b4's, one sees by inspection of the mass matrices in Eq. (3)\nthat mc /mt is of order \u01eb2 , whereas ms /mb , m\u03bc /m\u03c4 and Vcb are all of order \u01eb. This corresponds to the experimental\nfact that mc /mt \u2243 0.0025, whereas ms /mb , m\u03bc /m\u03c4 , and Vcb are given respectively by 0.02, 0.06, and 0.04. In fact, it\nis easy to show from Eq. (2) that Vcb0 \u2243 3\u01eb sin2 \u03b8a and (ms /mb )0 \u2243 3\u01eb sin \u03b8a cos \u03b8a , so that Vcb \u223c ms /mb , in agreement\np\nC\nC\n0\n|C1 |2 + |C2 |2 ,\nwith observation. One also easily sees that (ms /mb )0 \u2243 13 \u01eb 1+C\n2 and (m\u03bc /m\u03c4 ) \u2243 \u01eb 1+C 2 , where C \u2261\n0\n0\nso that the ratio (ms /mb ) /(m\u03bc /m\u03c4 ) is approximately 1/3, the Georgi-Jarlskog prediction [7].\n\n\f6\nThe u quark is left massless by the matrices in Eq. (3). However, that is not a bad thing. Experimentally, mu /mt\nis of order 10\u22125 , which is far smaller than the corresponding ratios md /mb \u223c 10\u22123 and me /m\u03c4 \u223c 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Thus,\nif md and me arise at one-loop level, one would expect mu to vanish at one-loop level.\nBefore analyzing the structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices further, it is necessary to deal with the\nquestion of the pattern of breaking of SO(10) down to the Standard Model group GSM = SU (3)c \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y .\nIII.\n\nTHE BREAKING OF SO(10)\n\nIf SO(10) broke at a single scale all the way to the Standard Model group GSM , it would give the same prediction\nfor the low energy gauge couplings as non-supersymmetric SU (5), which are known to be unsatisfactory. Moreover,\nas in non-supersymmetric SU (5), the proton lifetime would be too short. However, it is possible to get satisfactory\ngauge coupling unification and proton lifetime by assuming a two-stage breaking with the Pati-Salam group [12] as\nthe intermediate symmetry:\nM\n\nM\n\nPS\nG\nSU (3)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y\nSU (4)C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2212\u2192\nSO(10) \u2212\u2192\n\nThe breaking of SO(10) to the Pati-Salam group at the higher scale MG can be done by a 210H . The breaking of\nthe Pati-Salam group at MP S is done by the VEVs of the adjoint and spinor Higgs fields, 45H and 16iH , which also\ncontribute to the superheavy quark and lepton masses through couplings that appear in Eq. (2).\nIn running the gauge couplings between MG and MP S , the following matter multiplets contribute to the beta\nfunctions: (1) The quark and lepton multiplets, 161 , 162 , 163 , 16, 16, and 10. Since the masses of these multiplets\nare produced by coupling to the adjoint and spinor Higgs fields and not the 210H , their splittings are of order MP S\nand can be ignored in running between MG and MP S . (2) The Higgs multiplets 161H , 162H , 16\u2032H , 10H , 10\u2032H , and\nthree adjoint Higgs multiplets. For the Higgs multiplets too, except for the adjoints, it is assumed that the splittings\nare of order MP S and can be neglected in running between MG and MP S . For the adjoints, however, we assume\nsplittings of order MG . Under the Pati-Salam group a 45H decomposes to (15, 1, 1)H +(6, 2, 2)H +(1, 3, 1)H +(1, 1, 3)H .\nWe assume that the color-singlet pieces of the adjoints get mass of order MG and the color-non-singlet pieces get\nmass of order MP S . This is not unreasonable, since the renormalizable couplings of the adjoints to the 210H produce\nsplittings of order MG between the color-singlet and color-non-singlet pieces. (One such term is hH [IJKL] iH [IJ] H [KL] ,\nwhere the fundamental indices I, J, K, L take SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R values.) Of course, the whole Higgs potential must\nbe tuned to give the hierarchy between MG and MP S , so different patterns of splittings are possible. It is in order to\nget a value of MG large enough to be consistent with proton-decay limits, that we assume there are three split adjoint\nHiggs multiplets. More such adjoints would push MG higher. Below the scale MP S , we assume just the Standard\nModel field content with one Higgs doublet.\nThe results of the running are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\u0391i -1\n60\n\u03911 -1\n50\n\u03912 -1\n40\n\n\u0391L -1\n\n30\n\n-1\n\n\u03914 -1\n\u03913\n20\n\nLnH\u039cL\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFigure 3. The running of the gauge couplings. The Pati-Salam scale is indicated by the vertical line.\n\n\u22121\nIn the running, the input values used are \u03b11\u22121 (MZ ) = 58.97, \u03b1\u22121\n2 (MZ ) = 29.61, and \u03b13 (MZ ) = 8.47 [14]. The result of\n13\nthe running is that MP S = 4.79\u00d710 GeV. At MP S the Standard Model couplings have the values \u03b1\u22121\n1 (MP S ) = 41.35,\n\n\f7\n\u22121\n16\n\u03b1\u22121\nGeV. and\n2 (MP S ) = 43.21, and \u03b13 (MP S ) = 38.55. The unification scale comes out to be MG = 1.17 \u00d7 10\n\u22121\n\u03b1U (MG ) = 35.65. These values are consistent with present bounds on proton decay. (In this model, the dominant\ncontribution to proton decay comes from dimension-6 operators produced by the exchange of gauge bosons of mass\nMG . The Pati-Salam gauge bosons do not give proton decay.) The values of the gauge couplings plotted in Fig. 3\nare used in the running of the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles in section 5.\nOne consequence of the fact that SO(10) is broken down to the Pati-Salam group at a high scale is that it\nmakes more natural the assumption being made in this model that h45H i \u221d B \u2212 L. In the original supersymmetric\nversion of the model [4] this assumption was justified by the fact that a 45H whose VEV is proportional to B \u2212 L\nis needed to implement to Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism (or \"missing VEV mechanism\") [13] for doublet-triplet\nsplitting. However, in a non-supersymmetric SO(10) model, that mechanism does not work - and, in fact, doublettriplet splitting must be achieved through fine-tuning [15]. The justification for the assumption made in [3] that\nh45H i \u221d B \u2212 L is therefore less clear. However, if SO(10) breaks to the Pati-Salam group at the high scale MG in\nsuch a way that only the (1, 3, 1)H + (1, 1, 3)H in the adjoints have the large mass MG , as assumed, then the residual\n(15, 1, 1)H naturally obtains a VEV in the B \u2212L direction (and, in fact can do no other without breaking the Standard\nModel group at a superheavy scale).\n\nIV.\n\nMODIFICATIONS TO THE MASS MATRICES\n\nIn this section the implications for the mass matrices of the breaking of SO(10) down to the Pati-Salam group will\nbe analyzed.\nIn Eq. (3) the term M10 (10 10), as written, involves an explicit mass. This was the assumption made in [3]. It\nis also possible, however, and just as simple, to suppose that this mass arises from the VEV of some Higgs fields\nthat breaks SO(10). For example the term may come from (10 10)h45H ih45H i/MP S or from (10 10)h54H i. If M10\nreflects the breaking of SU (5) then it is a matrix that gives different values when acting on the down quarks and\non the charged leptons in the SO(10) 10 of fermions. Call its value for the leptons M and for the down quarks M \u2032 .\nOne result of this splitting is that the p\nentries Ci are no longer the same in the mass matrices ML and MD . If one\nassumes, as before, that the quantities 1 + (\u03a3i ci h16iH i/M10 )2 are well approximated by 1, then one can write the\nCi contributions to the mass matrices as Ci for ML and f Ci for MD , where f = M/M \u2032 . This SO(10)-breaking effect\nis, as it were, optional. However, it is quite important for fitting m0b /m0\u03c4 , which otherwise would be predicted to be\n1. The effects that will now be described are unavoidable consequences of the breaking of SO(10).\nSO(10)-breaking and SU (5)-breaking effects come into the loop contributions \u03b4gi and \u03b4H in several ways. Consider\n\u03b4H first. If one examines the diagram in Fig. 2 closely, one finds that its contribution to MD involves loops with\nscalars that can be either color triplets or color singlets, whereas its contributions to ML involve only color-triplet\nscalars. When SO(10) breaks to the Pati-Salam group, the degeneracy between these two types of scalars is badly\nbroken, which means that one cannot assume that Fig. 2 gives the same contribution to the two matrices. We\ntherefore introduce a factor fH into the 22 element of ML to reflect this fact.\nThe case of the elements \u03b4gi requires a more involved discussion. First, it must be noted that the vacuum expectation\nvalues h1(16iH )i and h45H i break the Pati-Salam group, and therefore must be no larger than MP S . Moreover, the\nmasses M10 and M16 cannot be too much larger than these VEVs, since otherwise the entries Ci and \u01eb would be too\nsmall. Consequently, one can assume that all the superheavy fermion masses are much lighter than the scale MG .\nThis has implications for the loop diagrams in Fig. 1. Some of those diagrams contain gauge bosons whose mass is\nof order MP S and others contain gauge bosons whose mass is of order MG . Because the fermions in those loops are\nmuch lighter than MG , as just argued, the loops with O(MG ) gauge bosons are suppressed relative to the loops with\nO(MP S ) gauge bosons by a large factor and are therefore negligible. To see what this implies, one must look in more\ndetail at the diagrams in Fig. 1 to see how they contribute to ML and MD .\nIn Fig. 4(a), is shown the contribution to ML . In this diagram there are three possible values of the color index\na, (or, equivalently, of the pair of color indices bc on the superheavy gauge boson X bc ). For any of these values, the\ngauge boson converts a left-handed charged lepton into a left-handed down-type quark at one vertex, and a left-handed\ncharged anti-lepton into a left-handed down-type anti-quark at the other vertex. That shows that the gauge boson is\none of those of the Pati-Salam group SU (4)c , which make such transitions. (The Pati-Salam multiplet (4, 2, 1) unifies\nleft-handed leptons and quarks, while the multiplet (4, 1, 2) unifies left-handed anti-leptons and anti-quarks.) For all\nthree values of a, therefore, the loop in Fig. 3(a) contains only gauge bosons whose mass is of order MP S .\nIn Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) are shown the diagrams that contribute to MD . In Fig. 4(b), the external quark has a\ncolor index of fixed value a, which determines uniquely the values of the color indices on the virtual gauge boson\nX bc . This gauge boson is (as in Fig. 4(a)) one of those of the Pati-Salam group SU (4)c , as can be seen from the fact\nthat it converts left-handed down quarks into left-handed charged leptons. In Fig. 4(c) there are two choices for the\ncolor index c on the gauge boson X 1c , since it is only required to be different from a. This gauge boson, however, is\n\n\f8\nobviously not one of those of the Pati-Salam group, since it converts a left-handed quark into a left-handed anti-quark\n(and a left-handed lepton into a left-handed anti-lepton), which are not unified together in the multiplets of the\nPati-Salam group. Thus the gauge boson in Fig. 4(c) has mass of order MG \u226b MP S . The diagram in Fig. 4(c) is\nthus highly suppressed. From these considerations, one sees that the contribution to ML has a factor 3 relative to the\ncontribution to MD because of the color degeneracy in the loop.\n\n\u272c\n\u2732\n12\n\u03c8(i)\n= l+\n(i)\n\nX bc\n\u271b\n\n7\n\u2732\n\u03c8(i)a hH i\n2\n= d(i)\n\n\u2729\n\u271b\n2a\n\u03c8(3)\n= d(3)\n\n\u271b\n\u03c8(3)1\n= l\u2212\n(3)\n\nFig. 4(a)\n\n\u272c\n\u2732\n2a\n\u03c8(i)\n\n\u2732\n\u03c8(i)1\n\n= d(i)\n\n= l\u2212\n(i)\n\nX bc\n\u271b\n\n7\n\nhH2 i\n\n\u2729\n\u271b\n12\n\u03c8(3)\n\n\u271b\n\u03c8(3)a\n\n= l+\n(3)\n\n= d(3)\n\nFig. 4(b)\n\n\u272c\n\u2732\n2a\n\u03c8(i)\n\n\u2732\n\u03c8(i)b\n\n= d(i)\n\n= d(i)\n\nX 1c\n\u271b\n\n7\n\nhH2 i\n\n\u2729\n\u271b\n2b\n\u03c8(3)\n\n\u271b\n\u03c8(3)a\n\n= d(3)\n\n= d(3)\n\nFig. 4(c)\nFig. 4 Gauge-boson-loop contribution to mass matrices.

(8) are those given by the model at the scale MP S , since that is the mass of\nthe superheavy fields that are integrated out to give these matrices. Below MP S , the model reduces to the Standard\nModel. One can therefore use the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of the one-Higgs-doublet Standard Model\nto run the measured quark and lepton masses and mixings from low scales up to MP S and then fit the results using\nthe forms in Eq. (8).\nRunning from MZ to MP S is done using the one-loop Standard Model RGEs given in [16].

For\nseveral quantities, namely the charged lepton masses, the mass of the u quark, and the atmospheric neutrino angle,\nwe will add a \"theoretical error bar\" to the experimental error bar in doing the \u03c72 fit. In the case of the charged\nleptons, we add a 1% fractional error to their masses, simply because we do not expect the forms in Eq. (8) to be\nmore accurate than that. (We have made approximations of that order in deriving them.)\nIn the case of mu , we add a theoretical error because the mass matrices we are using to do the fit include only\ntree-level and one-loop effects. A two-loop contribution to the 11 element of MU would be expected to be roughly of\n\u00012 0\n1\norder 16\u03c0\nmt \u223c 3.5 MeV. Thus we take the prediction of the model to be that m0u = 0 \u00b1 3.5 MeV. In other words,\n2\nthe theoretical error for mu is about 600% of the actual value of mu , so it has no effect on the fitting.\nIn the case of the atmospheric neutrino angle, there is an inherent uncertainty in the prediction of this model, due\nto the Majorana mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos MR being unknown and not predicted by the model.\nBecause the Dirac neutrino mass matrix MN is (to one-loop order) given by the form in Eq. (8), which has vanishing\nfirst row and column, it follows that the light neutrino mass matrix, given by the usual type-I see-saw formula\nT\nM\u03bd = \u2212MN\nMR\u22121 MN , also has vanishing first row and column. Thus, the unitary matrix U\u03bd required to diagonalize\nM\u03bd is simply a rotation by some angle \u03b8\u03bd in the 23 plane. From the form of MN , one expects generically that\n\u03b8\u03bd = O(\u01eb). Thus the mixing matrix of the neutrinos is given by\n\nUMN S\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= UL U\u03bd\u2020 = UL \uf8ed 0 cos \u03b8\u03bd \u2212 sin \u03b8\u03bd \uf8f8 ,\n0 sin \u03b8\u03bd cos \u03b8\u03bd\n\uf8eb\n\n(9)\n\nwhere UL is the unitary rotation of the left-handed charged leptons required to diagonalize ML .

In performing the fit to the\nwhere sin \u03b8atm\n, sin \u03b8sol\n, and sin \u03b813\nL\nL\nL\ndata, we take as the neutrino mixings predicted by the model sin \u03b8sol\n, sin \u03b8atm\n, and sin \u03b813\n, i.e. the angles obtained\nfrom diagonalizing the charged lepton mass matrix. These are what are given under \"model\" for these quantities in\nTable III. However, we take account of the unknown \u03b8\u03bd by including in the \"experimental error\" for sin \u03b8atm in Table\nIII a \"theoretical error\" corresponding to an angle of \u01eb = 0.19 rad.\nIn fitting, one has to take into account that the parameters appearing in Eq. (8) are, in general, complex. Because\nof the freedom to redefine the phases of the quark and lepton fields, most of the phases can be \"rotated away\" from\nthe low energy theory. We will consider two cases. If the group theoretical factors denoted f and fH are real, then\nthere are two physical phases in the mass matrices of Eq. (8), which one can take to be phases of the parameters \u01eb\n\n\f11\nand \u03b4H . We will denote these by \u03b8\u01eb and \u03b8H . If f and fH are complex, then there are two additional phases, which\nwe will denote \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8f H . The phase \u03b8\u2032 comes into the subleading terms of the 23 and 32 elements of MD and ML .\nThe phase \u03b8f H comes only into the 22 element of ML . The phase \u03b8\u2032 has only a small effect on the fit, and \u03b8f H has\nalmost none.\nAltogether, then, we fit using 9 real parameters (MU , MD , C1 , C2 , \u01eb, \u03b4, \u03b4H , f , fH ) and two or four phases (\u03b8\u01eb ,\n\u03b8H , and if f and fH are complex then also \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8f H ). With these we fit sixteen quantities: the 9 masses of the\nquarks and leptons (excluding the neutrino masses, which depend on the unknown MR ), the 3 CKM angles, the 1\nCKM phase, and the 3 neutrino mixing angles.\n\nme\nm\u03bc\nm\u03c4\nmu\nmc\nmt\nms /md\nms\nmb\nme md\nm\u03bc / ms\n\nmodel (at MP S )\n0.0004900\n0.1031\n1.756\n0\n0.342\n87.24\n18.68\n0.0358\n1.17\n0.0886\n\nexpt.

The CKM phase \u03b413 is in radians. One notes that most quantities are fit excellently. The least good fits are\nto mc , ms , and |Vub |. Considering that 11 parameters are fitting 16 quantities, the \u03c72 of 7.2 is quite reasonable.\nThe parameter values for this fit are \u01eb = 0.189, C1 = 1.03, C2 = \u22121.51, f = 0.566, fH = 0.208, 16\u03c0 2 \u03b4 = 2.22,\n16\u03c0 2 \u03b4H = 2.66, \u03b8\u01eb = 1.52 rad, \u03b8H = 0.514 rad. Note that all these quantities are of order one. In other words, no\nsmall dimensionless parameters are needed to fit the quark and lepton mass hierarchies in this model. The scales\ncalled mU and mD in Eq. (8) are given respectively by 86.9 GeV and 0.79 GeV. The large ratio of these scales is not\nexplained by the structure of the model or by symmetry, and presumably comes from the details of the sector that\nbreaks the weak interactions.\n\n\f12\n\nme\nm\u03bc\nm\u03c4\nmu\nmc\nmt\nms /md\nms\nmb\nme md\nm\u03bc / ms\n\nmodel (at MP S )\n0.0004888\n0.1032\n1.755\n0\n0.317\n87.22\n18.44\n0.0346\n1.17\n0.0874\n\nexpt.

The parameter values for the fit in\nTable IV are \u01eb = 0.182, C1 = 0.997, C2 = \u22121.60, f = 0.573, fH = 0.224, 16\u03c0 2 \u03b4 = 2.16, 16\u03c0 2 \u03b4H = 3.22, \u03b8\u01eb = \u22120.554\nrad, \u03b8H = \u22121.56 rad.\nComparison of Tables III and IV shows that the inclusion of the phases \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8f H makes very little difference to\nthe fits. This is not surprising, since \u03b8\u2032 appears only on subleading terms in the mass matrices, and \u03b8f H appears on\nthe very small entry fH . For the two fits, the values of the real parameters hardly changes. The phase angles \u03b8\u01eb\nand \u03b8H both change by -2.07 rad, but that is essentially due to a rephasing: a shift in these two phases by a certain\namount can be compensated by a shift in \u03b8\u2032 together with a change in the phase of two small subleading terms. In\nother words, what is really changing a lot between the fits in Tables III and IV is the phase \u03b8\u2032 (which is, of course,\nzero for the fit in Table III). What this shows is that the fit is hardly affected by large changes in \u03b8\u2032 .\nIn this model there is a relation between the atmospheric angle and \u03b813 , which is given in Eq. (10). Using the\nbest-fit values given in Table III, Eq. (10) yields\n| sin \u03b8atm | = | cos \u03b8\u03bd (0.891) \u2212 sin \u03b8\u03bd (0.396)|,\n| sin \u03b813 | = | cos \u03b8\u03bd (\u22120.014) + sin \u03b8\u03bd (0.518)|.\n\n(11)\n\n\u221a\n| sin \u03b813 | \u223c\n= 0.160 \u2212 0.72(sin \u03b8atm \u2212 1/ 2).\n\n(12)\n\nIf the parameter sin \u03b8\u03bd were a real number, these equations would give a prediction for \u03b813 in terms of \u03b8atm . For\nvalues of the atmospheric angle near maximal mixing, i.e. \u03b8atm \u223c\n= \u03c0/4, the prediction for the 13 angle would be\napproximately given by\n\nHowever, in fact, the parameter sin \u03b8\u03bd can be complex. Therefore, the smaller of the two values that is obtained for\n| sin \u03b813 | by solving Eq. (11) with real sin \u03b8\u03bd is a lower bound. So, if the atmospheric mixing angle is near maximum,\nthere is a lower bound on sin \u03b813 given by Eq. (12).\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe model that we have studied here is the first predictive grand unified model with a radiative fermion mass\nhierarchy. In a number of ways, it is as economical as a model of quark and lepton masses can be. The masses and\n\n\f13\nmixings of the second and third families come from only three effective Yukawa operators, shown in Eq. (1). These\noperators account for many features of the light fermion spectrum: (1) the fact that Vcb is of the same order as ms /mb\nand m\u03bc /m\u03c4 ; (2) the fact that mc /mt is much smaller than those ratios; (3) the largeness of the atmospheric and\nsolar neutrino angles; (4) the smallness of the 13 angle; (5) the rough equality of m0b and m0\u03c4 ; and (6) the GeorgiJarlskog factor of about 1/3 between ms /mb and m\u03bc /m\u03c4 . The masses and mixings of the first family (except for the\nsolar neutrino angle) come from loop diagrams. It is remarkable that one of these loop diagrams (Fig. 1) is present\nautomatically, whereas the other (Fig. 2) requires only a single additional Yukawa term to be postulated.\nIt is striking that no small parameters are needed in this model to account for the dramatic hierarchies in the quark\nand lepton masses. The model yields a definite relation between the atmospheric angle and the angle \u03b813 .\n\n[1] H. Georgi and S.L. Glashow, Phys. Rev. D7, 2457 (1973); R.N. Mohapatra, Phys. Rev.
