This view is based largely\non near-infrared (NIR) studies of star-forming (SF) regions within several hundred parsecs of the Sun [27, 29]. However, combining high-resolution mid-infrared\n(MIR) data with the NIR makes YSO identification more robust and less likely to\nsuffer from field star contamination, which leads to better tracing of YSO surface\ndensities. This means that with the NIR alone, there were large uncertainties in the\nnumber of stars at low values of YSO surface densities (\u03a3YSO ) [8].\nWith the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope [35] we are now able to differentiate YSOs and contaminating sources based on colour information and hence can\nstudy the distribution of YSOs independently of the surface densities.

Several Spitzer surveys that cover nearly all the SF regions within 500 pc of the Sun\nwere combined and presented by [7].\nThe spatial distribution of forming stars, i.e. do they form in clusters, is important\nfor many reasons and here we list several. What spatial distributions of star forming\nenvironments lead the Galactic stellar clusters and why do they constitute such a\nlow fraction of the stellar population? Are there multiple discrete modes of star\nformation, such as clustered and distributed, that manifest themselves as peaks in\na surface density distribution (e.g. [32, 8, 34, 33])? What fraction of star forming\nenvironments are dense enough to affect the YSOs and alter their disk and planet\nformation/evolution [1, 20], which we refer to as dense environments.\nOutside the Milky Way we see that star-formation proceeds hierarchically from \u223c\n10 pc (the resolution limit of most extragalactic surveys) to kpc scales (e.g. [10, 11,\n4, 5, 17]). If star formation occurs hierarchically down to 0.1 pc, then it is unlikely,\nand indeed not expected, that all stars form in gravitationally bound young stellar\nclusters. The availability of large FoV Spitzer surveys of nearby star-forming regions\nallows us to test how far down in scale this hierarchy proceeds. By hierarchical\nstructure we mean a smoothly varying non-uniform distribution of densities, where\ndenser subareas are nested within larger, less dense areas [31, 13].\nIn this paper we will investigate 1) whether there is evidence for multi-modality\nin the surface densities of YSOs, 2) what fraction of stars form in dense environments in the local neighbourhood and 3) how relevant the various cluster definitions\nare as provided by [8, 27, 1, 25, 21].\n\n2 Data & Biases\nMultiple Spitzer surveys were used to generate a comprehensive and statistically\nsignificant dataset to investigate the spatial surface density properties of forming\nstars in the solar neighbourhood. The surveys are the Gould's Belt (GB) survey\n(Allen et al. in prep.), Orion survey (Megeath et al. in prep.), Cores to Disks (c2d)\nsurvey [15], and the Taurus survey [30]. The GB and Orion catalogs have not been\npublicly released yet. There are more than 7000 YSO detections in the combined\ncatalogs at distances between 100 to 500 pc.\nSpitzer data are necessary for this study as low \u03a3YSO can be differentiated from\nfield star populations, unlike NIR observations where field star contamination can\nbe problematic. The comprehensive YSO population represents a global view of the\nlow-mass star-forming region in the local neighbourhood from low to high surface\ndensities. These Spitzer surveys combined represent the most complete census of\nstar formation within 500 pc of the Sun available to date.\nData treatment on distances, exclusion of the central region of the Orion Nebular\nCluster, rejection of Class III objects, and potential contaminants are described in\n\n\fDo All Stars Form in Clusters?\n\n3\n\nFig. 1 (a) The cumulative fraction of surface densities for the GB+Taurus, c2d, and Orion surveys. Each SF region included in the distributions has N(YSOs) \u2265 10 and a sufficient field-of-view\nto properly calculate stellar surface densities. The Orion survey stops at 73% for the cumulative\nfraction since the ONC is excluded. We adopt a 65% disk fraction for all of the SF regions. We\nnormalised each curve by the number of YSOs in each survey. (b) With the GB+Taurus, c2d, and\nOrion surveys combined we see Class I & II distributions having similar profiles with a small offset in density, showing that we are likely seeing the primordial distribution of the YSOs. (c) With\nall of the Spitzer surveys combined we compare several cluster definitions. The vertical grey lines\nfrom left to right are Lada & Lada (2003), Megeath et al. (in prep.), J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2008), Carpenter (2000), and Gutermuth et al. (2009) stellar density requirements for clusters. These values\ncorrespond to 3, 10, 20, 32, and 60 YSOs pc\u22122 and intersect the corrected cumulative distribution\nprofile, implying that 87%, 73%, 62%, 55%, and 43% of stars form in clusters, respectively. The\npercentages correlate to what fraction of stars form in 'clusters' based on the various definitions.\nThe black vertical line is for a dense environment where \u03a3 \u2265 200 YSOs/pc2 . The fraction of YSOs\nin a dense environment is < 26%.\n\n\f4\n\nEli Bressert, Nate Bastian & Robert Gutermuth\n\n[7]. After the data correction process, we have 3857 YSOs remaining to estimate\nthe surface densities presented in this paper.\n\n3 \u03a3YSO distributions\nOur primary tool for analysing the surface densities is computing the local observed surface density of YSOs centred on each YSO's position, where \u03a3YSO =\n(N \u2212 1)/(\u03c0 D2N ) and N is the Nth nearest neighbour, and DN is the projected distance to that neighbour (see [9]). Throughout this work we will adopt N = 7, although we note that all results have been tested for N = 4 \u2212 22 and no significant\ndifferences were found. Figure 1 shows the surface density distribution of all YSOs\nin our sample.\nIn order to see the fraction of YSOs above a given \u03a3 threshold, we show the combined \u03a3YSO distribution (shown as a cumulative fraction normalised to the number\nin each combined survey) for the three surveys used in this study in Fig. 1a. Note\nthat the GB/Taurus distribution lies to the left of the c2d survey. This is simply due\nto the GB/Taurus focussing on lower density regions than c2d. The cumulative distribution for the Orion survey only reaches 0.73 in Fig. 1a and 0.81 in Fig. 1c, where\nall the surveys have been combined, due to the exclusion of the ONC. In Fig. 1c we\nshow the cumulative distribution of all YSOs included in our survey, while in Fig. 1b\nwe split the survey into class I and class II objects.\n\n4 Results\nIt has been long assumed that two distinct modes of star formation exist for YSOs,\n'clustered' and 'distributed' (e.g. [19, 8, 27]), but the notion has been questioned\nafter Spitzer results hinted otherwise [1]. If there are indeed two modes, then we\nwould expect to see a bi- or multi-modal profile in cumulative surface density distribution plots such as Figs. 1a ands & 1c. Instead we see smooth and featureless\ndistributions from the low to high stellar surface densities for the c2d, GB, Taurus,\nand Orion surveys. We find that the \u03a3YSO distribution of low-mass stars in the solar\nneighbourhood can be well described by a lognormal function, as seen in 2, with a\npeak at \u223c 22 YSOs/pc2 and a dispersion \u03c3log10 \u03a3 = 0.85.\nThe spatial distribution of the YSOs in these SF regions is expected to be close to\nprimordial since their YSOs, in particular Class Is and Class IIs, are \u2264 2 Myr old [22,\n24]. In order to place stricter constraints on this, we now split the complete sample\ninto Class I and II objects, which can be roughly attributed to an age sequence.\nThe cumulative \u03a3 distributions of Class I and II YSOs are shown in Fig. 1b. We\nsee that the two distributions have similar smooth density spectra, however they are\nslightly offset. The \u03a3 of the Class I/II objects are calculated by finding a YSO's Nth\nnearest YSO. Once this is done for the YSOs we separate the Class I/II objects. \u03a3\n\n\fDo All Stars Form in Clusters?\n\n5\n\nFig. 2 Top panel: The surface density distribution of the total sample of YSOs in the solar neighbourhood used in this work (black). A lognormal function with a peak at \u223c 22 YSOs/pc2 and a\ndispersion \u03c3log10 \u03a3 = 0.85 is shown as a dashed line. Bottom panel: The same as the top panel but\nnow broken into the three respective surveys.\n\nis calculated this way since Class Is and Class IIs are not always spatially distinct\nfrom one another [21]. Class IIs are known to be slightly more dispersed than Class\nIs in high density regions [21] reflecting early dynamical evolution. However, the\nsimilar distribution between these classes leads us to conclude that the distribution\nof observed \u03a3 is mainly primordial in nature.\nIn Fig. 1c we show five vertical grey lines that refer to the defined densities required for a collection of YSOs to be considered 'clustered' (Lada & Lada 2003;\nMegeath et al. in prep.; J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2008; Carpenter 2000, Gutermuth et\nal. 2009). The vertical lines fall on the same featureless slope and do not correspond to any preferred density. The black vertical line, which corresponds to dense\nenvironments (as defined in [20]), shows that < 26% of YSOs are formed in environments where they (along with their disks and planets) are likely to interact with\ntheir neighbours.\n\n5 Discussion and Conclusions\nWe conclude that stars form in a broad and smooth spectrum of surface densities\nand do not find evidence for discrete modes of star formation in the \u03a3 of low mass\n\n\f6\n\nEli Bressert, Nate Bastian & Robert Gutermuth\n\nYSOs forming in the solar neighbourhood. The observed lognormal surface density\ndistribution is consistent with predictions of hierarchically structured star-formation,\nwhich arise from similar structures in molecular clouds. ([12, 14]). Our results suggest that clusters are not fundamental units in the star formation process, but simply\nthe high density tail end of a continuous distribution. A small fraction (< 26%) of\nstars form in dense environments where their formation and/or evolution is expected\nto be influenced by their surroundings.\nBy comparing our global surface density distribution with the summary of cluster definitions in [7], we find that the fraction of stars forming in clusters is crucially\ndependent on the adopted definitions (ranging from \u223c 40 to 90%). Since star/cluster\nformation happens in a dynamic environment [6, 2, 28] it may be impossible to\ndefine what will become a stellar cluster in these early stages, as the final object\nthat remains bound is simply the dynamically mixed part of a larger, initially hierarchical, distribution. In this scenario a cluster can only be clearly defined above\nthe surrounding distribution once it is dynamically evolved where tage /tcross > 1, as\ndefined by Gieles & Portegies Zwart 2010.\nStar forming environments provide the initial conditions from which star clusters may eventually form, albeit rarely. Since the probability density function of\nmolecular gas varies with environment, as does the tidal field experienced by the SF\nregions, it is likely that the fraction of YSOs ending up in bound star clusters varies\nwith environment [14] and the observed \u03a3YSO is not universal. Future investigations\nwill extend this work out to 2 kpc where proto-stellar cores and high-mass SF regions will be included, and testing whether star formation primarily occurs when\n\u03a3gas is above a specific threshold (e.g. [23, 3, 26])\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the organisers of the JENAM cluster for arranging\nthe meeting and inviting us to contribute our work.
