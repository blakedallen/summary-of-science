Choosing \u03bb = A \u2212 \u01eb covers most of the proof of the Ergodic Theorem.\nTheorem. Let \u03bb be an invariant (\u03bb \u25e6 T = \u03bb a.e.) function on X with \u03bb+ \u2208 L1 .\nThen\nZ\n(f \u2212 \u03bb) \u2265 0.\n{f \u2217 >\u03bb}\n\nProof. We may assume that \u03bb \u2208 L1 {f \u2217 > \u03bb}, since otherwise\nZ\n(f \u2212 \u03bb) = \u221e \u2265 0.\n{f \u2217 >\u03bb}\n\nBut then actually \u03bb \u2208 L1 (X), since on {f \u2217 \u2264 \u03bb} we have f \u2264 \u03bb, so that on this set\n\u03bb\u2212 \u2264 \u2212f + \u03bb+ , which is integrable.\nAssume first that f \u2208 L\u221e .

Beginning after the last\nterm in this string, we repeat the previous analysis, finding maybe some 0's until\nagain some T k x \u2208 EN initiates another string of no more than N terms and with\npositive sum. The full sum of m terms may end in the middle of either of these two\nkinds of strings (0's, or having positive sum).

This proof may be regarded as a further development of one given in\na paper by Keane [10], which has been extended to deal also with the Hopf Ratio Ergodic Theorem [8] and with the case of higher-dimensional actions [11], and\nwhich was itself a development of the Katznelson-Weiss proof [9] based on Kamae's\nnonstandard-analysis proof [7]. (It is presented also in the Bedford-Keane-Series collection [1].) Our proof yields both the Pointwise and Maximal Ergodic Theorems essentially simultaneously without adding any real complications. Roughly contemporaneously with this formulation, Roland Zweim\u00fcller prepared some preprints [21, 22]\nalso giving short proofs based on the Kamae-Katznelson-Weiss approach, and recently he has also produced a simple proof of the Hopf theorem [23]. Without going\ntoo deep into the complicated history of the Ergodic Theorem and Maximal Ergodic\nTheorem, it is interesting to note some recurrences as the use of maximal theorems\narose and waned repeatedly. After the original proofs by von Neumann [18], Birkhoff\n[2], and Khinchine [12], the role and importance of the Maximal Lemma and Maximal Theorem were brought out by Wiener [19] and Yosida-Kakutani [20], making\npossible the exploration of connections with harmonic functions and martingales.\nProofs by upcrossings followed an analogous pattern. It also became of interest,\nfor instance to allow extension to new areas or new kinds of averages, again to\nprove the Ergodic Theorem without resort to maximal lemmas or theorems, as in\nthe proof by Shields [16] inspired by the Ornstein-Weiss proof of the ShannonMcMillan-Breiman Theorem for actions of amenable groups [14], or in Bourgain's\nproofs by means of variational inequalities [3]. Sometimes it was pointed out, for\nexample in the note by R. Jones [6], that these approaches could also with very\nslight modification prove the Maximal Ergodic Theorem. Of course there are the\ntheorems of Stein [17] and Sawyer [15] that make the connection explicit, just as the\ntransference techniques of Wiener [19] and Calder\u00f3n [4] connect ergodic theorems\nwith their analogues in analysis like the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Lemma [5]. In\nmany of the improvements over the years, ideas and tricks already in the papers\nof Birkhoff, Kolmogorov [13], Wiener, and Yosida-Kakutani have continued to play\nan essential role.\nAcknowledgment\nThis note arose out of a conversation between the authors in 1997 at the Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics in Vienna, and we\nthank that institution for its hospitality.
