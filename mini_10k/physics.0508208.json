A. Rohde, K. Hasegawa, and M. Deutsch\n\narXiv:physics/0508208v3 [physics.optics] 18 Jan 2006\n\nOregon Center for Optics and Department of Physics, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403\n(Dated: October 29, 2018)\nWe report on measurements of visible extinction spectra of semicontinuous silver nanoshells grown\non colloidal silica spheres. We find that thin, fractal shells below the percolation threshold exhibit\ngeometrically tunable plasmon resonances. A modified scaling theory approach is used to model the\ndielectric response of such shells, which is then utilized to obtain the extinction cross section in a\nretarded Mie scattering formalism. We show that such spherical resonators support unique plasmon\ndynamics: in the visible there is a new regime of coherently driven cluster-localized plasmons, while\ncrossover to homogeneous response in the infrared predicts a delocalized shell plasmon.\n\nNoble-metal nano-scale shells are comprised of thin\ngold or silver films surrounding sub-micron dielectric\ncores. In recent years nanometer-scale metal particles have been the focus of extensive studies, owing\nmainly to large enhancements of surface-induced electric\nfields at the plasma resonance of the nanoparticles [1].\nThis unique optical response is well exemplified in the\nnanoshells' extinction spectra, which are governed by a\ngeometrically tunable plasmon resonance. When the core\ndiameter is in the sub-micrometer range, the optical response of the composite particle is tunable over the entire visible and near infrared spectrum [2]. This constitutes a powerful tool for custom-designing Raman [3] and\nsurface-plasmon-based ultra sensitive optical sensors [4].\nThe strong optical resonance observed in spherical\nnanoshells is attributed to a delocalized shell plasmon,\ntypically well-modelled by classical linear response to\nelectromagnetic (EM) plane-wave scattering [5]. This\nwas formulated by Aden and Kerker (AK) [6] as an extension to classical Mie scattering theory. More refined theories utilizing ab-initio quantum mechanical modelling of\nmetallic nanoshells have also verified this approach [7].\nThe existence of a spherical\u2013shell plasmon relies on a\nsymmetric and uniform shell morphology, and is typically\nobserved in smooth, continuous nanoshells. It has been\npreviously shown that extinction spectra of incomplete,\nhighly fragmented nanoshells do not exhibit geometrical\nresonances [8], but are dominated instead by absorption\nresonances of the metal clusters on the spheres [9].\nIn this Letter we present light scattering experiments of silica spheres coated with discontinuous silver\nnanoshells. We distinguish two shell morphologies with\ndiffering optical signatures. For thin, two-dimensional\n(2D) fractal shells, the optical response of the metal is\nbest described within the framework of percolation theory. While these shells support mainly localized plasmon\nmodes and are electrically insulating, distinct geometrical resonances are clearly present, due to coherent optical driving of cluster-localized plasmons. For thick (3D),\nconducting and porous shells classical, Maxwell Garnett\n(MG) theory is used instead to obtain the effective dielectric response of the shell. In both cases, although\n\nthe shells are locally highly irregular, observed fine resonances are still well modelled by the AK solution to\nMaxwell's equations for uniform core/shell systems.\nColloidal silica spheres (0.3-1\u03bcm diameter, 2% polydisperse) were coated with nanocrystalline silver shells using\na Tollen's reagent method to form dielectric core\u2013metal\nshell particles [10]. Aqueous ammoniacal silver nitrate\nwas mixed with an aldehyde reducing agent such as glucose, leading to rapid precipitation of silver atoms. At\n3\u25e6 C the reaction kinetics are dramatically slowed, resulting in controlled growth of nanocrystalline silver, only at\nthe spheres' surfaces. Typical reactions last 20-30min.\nRepeated centrifugation and sonication are utilized to\neliminate residual silver nanocrystals from solution. Despite a lack of surface functionalization, the silver adheres\nstrongly to the spheres and does not separate during this\nprocess. More than 70 such batches were synthesized.\nTransmission electron micrographs (TEM) of more\nthan 200 coated spheres per data set are used to determine average shell thickness and polydispersity. For thin\ncoatings (\u223c20 - 30nm) ensemble polydispersities can remain as low as 2%, indicating highly uniform deposition.\nHigh resolution TEM analyses of isolated metal clusters\nof \u223c 100nm mean size indicate the latter consist of aggregated nanocrystals 5 - 10nm in diameter.\nFurther characterization of the shells' morphologies\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Scanning electron micrograph of 1\u03bcm diameter\nsilica sphere coated with 20nm\u2013thick silver shell. Scale bar is\n500nm. (b) Digitally processed (see text) magnified view of\nregion inside the square in (a). Scale bar is 200nm. Silver appears white and dielectric inclusions are black. (c) Histogram\nof p, generated from 80 images similar to (b).\n\n\f2\nutilizes high-resolution scanning electron micrographs\n(SEM). These reveal the non-contiguous nature of the\nthin shells, which we characterize in terms of their metal\nfilling fraction, p, and a fractal dimension, Df . SEM\nimages as in Fig.1(a) are first processed with a high\npass fast Fourier transform filter to eliminate nonuniform\nbackground intensity variations across the sphere surface.\nSphere curvature and shadowing effects are minimized\nby utilizing only a small portion of the exposed surfaces\nclose to nadir, shown enclosed in the box in Fig.1(a).\nThe size of this area must be small enough to minimize\nshadowing effects, while still sufficiently large to provide\nstatistical integrity. With a resolution-limited pixel size\nof \u2243 2nm, for coated spheres of radius R a box size of\n(R2 /4) \u2243 2002 pixels satisfies this condition. Linear contrast enhancement and thresholding of the cropped section provide the binary image in Fig.1(b). Visual inspection of such images suggests a strong resemblance to\npercolating planar metal films deposited under ultra-high\nvacuum, where both linear and nonlinear optical characteristics have been previously addressed [11, 12].\nWe measure the fractal dimension of thin films such as\nin Fig.1(b) by implementing a box-counting method [13]\nover two orders of magnitude, and find Df = 1.72 \u00b1 0.06,\nindicating diffusion-limited aggregation in 2D [14]. Since\nthis is below the fractal dimension of 2D percolating clusters, Dp = 1.89 [15], we conclude these shells lie slightly\nbelow the percolation threshold. We have verified this\nby measuring the average filling fraction p of thin shells\nutilizing the processed SEM images. For an ensemble of\n\u223c100 spheres we find p = 0.55, shown in Fig.1(c). Comparing to the experimental percolation threshold, pc =\n0.68 [11], our thin shells have p <\n\u223c pc .\nThis is supported by measurements of the bulk resistance of silver-coated spheres. A dense aggregate of\nspheres is formed by drying several concentrated drops of\nthe sphere suspension between two gold electrodes separated by \u223c100\u03bcm. For shells 20 - 30nm thick we measure\na resistance R\u223c20M\u03a9, while shells of thickness \u226570nm\nexhibit a resistance of R\u22431\u03a9. These are typical values,\nalso obtained previously for the sheet resistance of planar\nthin metal films near the percolation threshold [11].\nTo optically characterize our core/shell composites we\nmeasured the extinction of freshly prepared, dilute aqueous suspensions using a UV/vis spectrometer. Spectra\nof sparsely coated spheres as in Fig.2(a) exhibit only a\nsingle peak centered near 420nm. This is a signature\nof the excitation of the dipolar plasmon eigenmodes of\nindividual, non-aggregated silver nanocrystals nucleated\non the spheres [9]. Due to the dilute metal surfacecoverage, these modes do not couple to the weak Mie\nresonances of the dielectric spheres, and are therefore independent of sphere size. At the opposite extreme are\ndensely coated spheres as in Fig.2(b), exhibiting multipolar core/shell resonances [5]. In this limit the extinction is well-modelled by applying MG theory within the\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Extinction of sparsely coated 1\u03bcm diameter\nspheres (TEM inset) showing a dipolar plasmon resonance at\n420nm. (b) Measured extinction (dots) and fitted AK model\nusing MG theory (line) for 70nm-thick shells (SEM inset).\n\nAK framework, as discussed in a later section.\nNucleation and aggregation of silver crystals onto the\nspheres result in an intermediate regime of discontinuous\nnanoshells of thickness 20 - 30nm. Extinction spectra of\nthe spheres in Fig.1(a) reveal several distinct resonance\npeaks, all shifted from the single-particle plasmon resonance, as shown in Fig.3(a). These are core/shell multipole modes, typically observed in high-contrast layered\nspherical particles. In addition, the inhomogeneously\nbroadened enhanced red extinction tail present in fractal\nmetal aggregates [16] is strongly modulated here. These\nindicate cluster-localized plasmon modes are interacting\nvia cavity Mie resonances. Furthermore, varying the core\nsize affects both peak number and positions, verifying the\ngeometric nature of the resonances. In this new regime of\ncoherently driven localized plasmons collective response\nof a strongly disordered shell is thus achieved.\nThe often-used AK formalism, which accounts for multiple scattering in layered concentric shells [6], requires\nknowledge of the dielectric functions of core, shell and\nembedding medium materials. Using tabulated values for\nthe dielectric function of bulk silver to model the extinction coefficient exhibited serious discrepancies and failed\nto reproduce the experimental data, as seen in Fig. 3(a).\nAs previously indicated, thin-shell samples are insulating, with filling fractions close to the percolation threshold. Hence, we develop a method for modelling the optical response of such quasi-shells based on scaling theory\n(ST) of percolating planar metal films. The details of ST\nare described elsewhere [11], and we summarize only its\ngermane points. Scaling properties of fractal networks\nof conductors allow the definition of a scaling function\n[17]. A dielectric function \u01eb(\u03c9; L\u03be ) is obtained in terms\nof this function and a characteristic length scale L\u03be (\u03c9),\ndescribing the largest length scale over which homogeneous averaging may occur. L\u03be (\u03c9) is determined by the\nsmallest relevant length scale: the percolation correlation\nlength, \u03be, or the optical coherence length L(\u03c9), given by\n\n\u03be \u221d (|p \u2212 pc |/pc )\nL(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u22121/(2+\u03b8)\n\n\u2212\u03bd\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\n\f3\nthreshold. In the IR, Re[\u01ebshell (\u03c9)] crosses over to negative\nvalues. For common embedding dielectrics the crossover\nto metallic behavior occurs at \u03bb \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2\u03bcm. This is related to a crossover from inhomogeneous to homogeneous\noptical response, calculated to occur near \u03bb\u03be \u223c 650nm in\nour samples [11]. For \u03bb \u226b \u03bb\u03be the shell may be treated\nas optically homogeneous. The consequences of this are\ndiscussed in a later section.\nThe physical properties of composite materials are often treated using an effective-medium approach. According to this method, when spatial inhomogeneities manifest on scales much smaller than the relevant length scale\nin the system, here the optical wavelength, average homogeneous treatment is justified. However, close enough\nto the percolation threshold this is known to break down\n[11, 19, 20]. We have examined Bruggeman effective\nmedium theory (EMT), best suited for systems near percolation [21, 22], as a plausible model for the shells' response. The effective dielectric function, \u01ebeff is given by\nFIG. 3: (a) Comparison of normalized, averaged EMT (blue),\nand ST (red) extinctions with measured spectra (dots). Also\nshown is the extinction obtained using the tabulated bulk\nsilver dielectric function (black). (b) Normalized extinction\nspectra of two typical thin-shell samples with same core/shell\nsize. Inset: Spectra after subtracting computed background\nfunctions. (c) Comparison of background-subtracted, averaged extinction for EMT (blue), ST (red) and a typical data\nset (black). All samples had 1\u03bcm diameter cores and 20nmthick shells.\n\nFor a 2D system near percolation the critical exponent\nis \u03bd = 4/3, and \u03b8 = 0.79. A dielectric function \u01ebi (\u01ebc ),\ncorresponding to the thin-shell insulating (conducting)\ncomponent [11], is calculated for each length scale L\u03be (\u03c9)\nusing parameters relevant to our system [18].\nThe main difference between near-percolation planar\nfilms and our nanoshells stems from the closed shell\ngeometry, which introduces correlations between film\ncomponents, otherwise uncorrelated in an open, planar\nconfiguration. This allows coherent driving of clusterlocalized plasmon resonances through multipole electromagnetic cavity-modes, clearly resolved in the extinction\nspectra. We account for this cluster-coupling by defining\nthe shell-averaged dielectric function\n\u01ebshell(\u03c9) = h\u01eb(\u03c9; L\u03be )i = p\u01ebc (\u03c9, L\u03be ) + (1 \u2212 p)\u01ebi (\u03c9, L\u03be ) (2)\nwhich is then utilized to calculate the extinction cross\nsection in the AK formalism.\nThe resulting effective dielectric function exhibits characteristics strikingly different from those of both bulk and\nnanocrystalline silver. Most importantly, in the visible\nand near infrared (IR) spectral range Eq. (2) yields positive values for Re[\u01ebshell (\u03c9)] and relatively large values for\nIm[\u01ebshell (\u03c9)], implying a lossy dielectric response. This\nis typical of disordered 2D metals below the percolation\n\np\n\n\u01ebm \u2212 \u01ebeff\n\u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebeff\n+ (1 \u2212 p)\n=0\ng\u01ebm + (1 \u2212 g)\u01ebeff\ng\u01ebd + (1 \u2212 g)\u01ebeff\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u01ebm and \u01ebd are known dielectric functions of the interpenetrating metal and the dielectric, respectively, and\npc = g = 0.68 is the depolarization factor in 2D [11].\nUsing measured values of p we obtain an expression for\n\u01ebeff , which is then utilized to calculate the extinction cross\nsection as described above. For the relevant experimental\nparameters [18], \u01ebeff is a positive function over the entire\nEM spectral range, implying non-metallic response. As\na final step for both ST and EMT approaches, the calculated extinction cross sections are averaged over the\nmeasured filling fraction p and sphere size distributions\n[23], and are plotted together for comparison in Fig.3(a).\nComparing the models reveals discrepancies in the general trend of the functions, with ST better following the\ndata. Most importantly, the number of resonances, their\nposition and especially contrast, are poorly described by\nEMT. We note data collected from different batches may\nexhibit opposite trends, as illustrated by the two typical\nexamples in Fig.3(b). This is attributed mainly to various degrees of nanocrystal aggregation present in each\nbatch, where increased aggregation results in a broad, enhanced red absorption tail. To account for this we first\nconstruct a background continuum function by applying\na 50nm boxcar average to the extinction spectra. Subtraction of each continuum function from its respective\nspectrum reveals excellent agreement between the prominent spectral features, shown in Fig.3(b) (inset).\nFig.3(c) shows background-subtracted spectra, which\nmay be further analyzed using bandpass spectrophotometry. Due to the large number of parameters used by ST as\nwell as the highly complex nature of the multipolar vector spherical harmonics, conventional multivariate fitting\nmethods proved inefficient. Nevertheless, ST clearly best\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Calculated extinction for ST (line) and\nEMT (dashed) for p = 0.55, 20nm\u2013thick silver shells on 1\u03bcm\ndiameter silica cores.\n\nreproduces the experimental data, while EMT lacks the\ncontrast to account for the observed resonances. We attribute the remaining discrepancies between ST and the\ndata to a non-ideal experimental system, its main limitation being irregular shell boundaries, whose additional\nlosses cannot be accounted for within the AK formalism.\nAs shell thickness increases through deposition of additional silver, we observe shifting of the resonances as in\nFig.2(b). High-resolution SEM micrographs indicate the\nincrease in thickness is accompanied by filling of interparticle voids, as well as shell-coarsening. Shells thicker\nthan 50nm are therefore better treated as 3D aggregates of nanocrystals, with filling fractions estimated at\n<\n0.8 <\n\u223c p \u223c 0.9. Average measured polydispersities of such\nshells may still be as low as 5%. Extinction spectra reveal characteristics closely similar to those of continuous\nsilver nanoshells. We may therefore describe the effective\ndielectric response of porous shells using the classical MG\nmodel. The dielectric function \u01ebMG is given now by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3(1 \u2212 p)(\u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebm )/(\u01ebd + 2\u01ebm )\n(4)\n\u01ebMG = \u01ebm 1 +\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)(\u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebm )/(\u01ebd + 2\u01ebm )\ndescribing a solid silver shell with 1 \u2212 p volume fraction\nof spherical dielectric inclusions. Following our procedure\nfor calculating the size-averaged extinction cross section\n[24], we obtain the plot in Fig.2(b). We find this model\nreproduces well our experimental observations.\nAn interesting discrepancy between ST and EMT\nemerges when the extinction calculations are extended to\nthe IR, as in Fig.4. We find ST predicts broad IR absorption, while EMT exhibits a decaying Rayleigh tail. The\nbroad peak near 3.2\u03bcm is a mostly dipolar shell plasmon\nresonance, verified by numerical mode-decomposition of\nabsorption and scattering cross-sections. This is a consequence of the above mentioned ST-crossover to metallic\nbehavior, which enables the excitation of a delocalized\nshell plasmon. Note this IR resonance should be distinguished from anomalous IR absorption in metal-dielectric\ncomposites [16]. The latter originates from enhanced absorption in the embedding dielectric, due to intense local\nelectric fields [25]. Here we assume both silica core and\ndielectric inclusions in the shell are lossless, therefore all\nabsorption is due to intrinsic losses in the metal shell.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that extinction properties of semicontinuous silver nanoshells grown on dielectric cores unambiguously differ from previously reported\ncontinuous core/shell systems. We have demonstrated\ntuning of the plasmon resonance with shell growth \u2013\nfrom a single dipolar mode in sparse coatings to multiple\nhigh order shell excitations in densely packed thick shells.\nWe have identified an intermediate regime of thin fractal shells near the percolation threshold, where geometrically tunable plasmon resonances persist despite disorder and the shells' discontinuous character. A modified\napproach for modelling the dielectric response of fractal\nshells, based on scaling theory is consistent with experimental observations. We attribute this new resonant\nregime to cluster-localized plasmons, coherently driven\nby micro-resonator modes. Future work will address the\npredicted delocalized plasmon resonance, resulting from\na crossover to homogeneous metallic response in the IR .\nThe authors thank J. Bouwman and S.
