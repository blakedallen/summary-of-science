We show that the conclusions presented in that paper do not\napply to the exact field theoretical oscillation formulae obtained in the BV formalism (for three\nflavors) which are free from the dependence on arbitrary mass parameters, account for CP violation\nand reduce to the usual quantum mechanical (Pontecorvo) three flavor oscillation formulae in the\nrelativistic limit.\n\nP.A.C.S.: 14.60.Pq\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years exact formulae for neutrino oscillations have been obtained in the quantum field theory (QFT)\nframework [1\u20135] (hereafter referred to as the BV formalism by following Ref. [6]). In the paper \"Remarks on flavorneutrino propagators and oscillation formulae\" [Phys. Rev. D 64, 013011 (2001)] [7] it has been remarked that by the\nuse of the retarded propagators different formulae can be obtained which are free from the dependence on arbitrary\nmass parameters and in the case of three flavor oscillations they reduce to the formulae obtained in the BV formalism\nonly when the mixing matrix is real. No problem arises in the two flavor case, in the sense that the retarded propagator\nderivation gives same oscillation formulae as obtained in [2].\nIn the following we observe that the formulae obtained in Ref. [7] are not physically acceptable since they do not\nallow CP violation and do not reduce to the usual Pontecorvo three flavor formulae in the relativistic limit. We note\nthat, on the contrary, our formulae do account for CP violation, are independent of arbitrary mass parameters and\ndo reduce to the usual Pontecorvo three flavor formulae in the relativistic limit.\nApart from the latter property, which by itself is not at all a negligible requirement to be satisfied, the consistency\nwith CP violation discriminates with a clear cut between our formulae and those derived by the use of the retarded\npropagator. Moreover, it also points to the necessity of using the flavor Hilbert space, as indeed emerges in our\ntreatment. In this respect, we observe that the authors of Ref. [7] actually do not exclude the possibility of using\nsuch a flavor state space. On the contrary, they analyze the arguments presented in Ref. [8] and conclude that the\nassertion there presented against the flavor space is not appropriate.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the main lines of our derivation for the three flavor case (see\nalso [5]). Subsequently, we discuss the results of Ref. [7] and see that they are physically not acceptable for the reasons\nsaid above.\nThe derivation of the three flavor oscillation formulae proceeds along the same line of the derivation for the two\nflavor case. We use standard QFT for the neutrino fields and the familiar parameterization of the CKM matrix [9].\nWe write down the generator for the mixing transformations in terms of the Dirac neutrino fields \u03bdi with masses mi ,\ni = 1, 2, 3, then we consider the charges for \u03bdi and for the flavor neutrinos \u03bd\u03c3 , \u03c3 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 . We construct the flavor\nstate space, which is found to be unitarily inequivalent to the state space for the mass eigenstate neutrinos, and\nwe compute the expectation values of the flavor charges in the flavor states, thereby obtaining the exact oscillation\nformulae. We finally discuss the CP violation. Besides the obvious higher level of computational complexity, the\nessential, non-trivial difference with respect to the two flavor case is indeed in the physically relevant fact that the\nthree flavor oscillation formulae must account for CP violation.\nWe then analyze the derivation of the formulae given in [7] and discuss their independence of the CP violating\nphase and their failure in reducing to the usual Pontecorvo formulae in the relativistic case.\n\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: m.blasone@ic.ac.uk, capolupo@sa.infn.it, vitiello@sa.infn.it\n\n1\n\n\fWe observe that the conclusions reached in the present paper can be extended as well to the case of boson mixing\n[10,11] with number of flavors larger than two.\nWe consider the CKM matrix for neutrinos:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b4\n(1)\n\u03a8f (x) = \uf8ed\u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 s23 c13 \uf8f8 \u03a8m (x) ,\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 \u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 c23 c13\nwith cij = cos \u03b8ij , sij = sin \u03b8ij being \u03b8ij the mixing angles, \u03a8Tm = (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 ) and \u03a8Tf = (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ).

The vacuum for the mass eigenstates\nr\nis denoted by |0im : \u03b1rk,i |0im = \u03b2k,i\n|0im = 0. The anticommutation relations are the usual ones; the wave function\northonormality and completeness relations are those of Ref. [1].\nThe flavor vacuum is defined as\n|0(t)if = G\u22121\n\u03b8 (t) |0im ,\n\n(8)\n\nand its orthogonality (unitary inequivalence) in the infinite volume limit to the vacuum |0im is obtained as shown\nin Ref. [1]. We observe that the unitary inequivalence of the flavor vacuum to the mass eigenstate vacuum has been\nrigorously proved for the general case of any number of flavors in Ref. [13].\nThe flavor fields are expanded as:\nh\ni\nXZ\nr\u2020\nr\n\u03bd\u03c3 (x) =\nd3 k urk,j \u03b1rk,\u03c3 (t) + v\u2212k,j\n\u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3\n(t) eik*x ,\n(9)\nr\n\nr\u2020\nr\u2020\n\u22121\nr\nwhere \u03b1rk,\u03c3 (t) \u2261 G\u22121\n\u03b8 (t) \u03b1k,j (t) G\u03b8 (t) and \u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t) \u2261 G\u03b8 (t) \u03b2\u2212k,j G\u03b8 (t) with (\u03c3, j) = (e, 1), (\u03bc, 2), (\u03c4, 3).\nIn order to derive oscillation formulae, we define the flavor charges Q\u03c3 (\u03c3 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) as [4,5]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXZ\nr\u2020\nr\nr\nQ\u03c3 (t) =\nd3 k \u03b1r\u2020\nk,\u03c3 (t)\u03b1k,\u03c3 (t) \u2212 \u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t)\u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t) ,\n\n(10)\n\nr\n\nwhich are connected to the (conserved) Noether charges Qi of the free fields via the mixing generator: Q\u03c3 (t) =\nG\u22121\n\u03b8 (t)Qj G\u03b8 (t), ((\u03c3, j) = (e, 1), (\u03bc, 2), (\u03c4, 3)). As usual in QFT, one must perform subtraction of the vacuum contributions, or, in other words, use normal ordering with respect to the vacuum where one operates with charges and\ncurrents.\nWe define the \u03c1-flavor neutrino state with a given momentum and helicity as |\u03bd\u03c1 i \u2261 \u03b1r\u2020\nk,\u03c1 |0if and similarly for\nr\nantiparticles. In the following for simplicity we use \u03b1\u03c1 \u2261 \u03b1rk,\u03c1 and \u03b2\u03c1 \u2261 \u03b2\u2212k,\u03c1\n. We then obtain the oscillation\nformulae for neutrinos and antineutrinos as\n2\n\n\fQ\u03c1\u03c3 (t) \u2261 h\u03bd\u03c1 |Q\u03c3 (t)|\u03bd\u03c1 i \u2212 f h0|Q\u03c3 (t)|0if =\n\n\b\n\n\u03b1\u03c3 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c1 (0)\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\b \u2020\n\u03b2\u03c3 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c1 (0)\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\b\n\b\n2\n2\nQ\u03c1\u0304\u03c3 (t) \u2261 h\u03bd\u0304\u03c1 |Q\u03c3 (t)|\u03bd\u0304\u03c1 i \u2212 f h0|Q\u03c3 (t)|0if = \u2212 \u03b2\u03c3 (t), \u03b2\u03c1\u2020 (0)\n\u2212 \u03b1\u2020\u03c3 (t), \u03b2\u03c1\u2020 (0)\n.\n(12)\nP\nP\nwith \u03c3 Q\u03c1\u03c3 (t) = \u2212 \u03c3 Q\u03c1\u0304\u03c3 (t) = 1.\nThe above formulae coincide with the usual quantum-mechanical ones in the relativistic limit [5]. Indeed, in this\nlimit, the (anti-)neutrino state reduces to the usual quantum-mechanical one, defined on the vacuum |0im and one\nhas [5] (considering neutrinos for example):\nQ\u03c1\u03c3 (t) \u2212\u2192\n\n\b\n\u03b1\u03c3 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c1 (0)\n\n2\n\n= h\u03bd\u03c1 |N\u03c3 (t)|\u03bd\u03c1 i = |h\u03bd\u03c1 (t)|\u03bd\u03c1 (0)i|2 ,\n\nf or |k| \u226b mi , i = 1, 2, 3 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is interpretable as a transition probability.\nThe CP and T violations are calculated as [5]:\n(t) \u2261 Q\u03c1\u03c3 (t) + Q\u03c1\u0304\u03c3 (t)\n\u2206\u03c1\u03c3\nCP\n\n(14)\n\n\u2206\u03c1\u03c3\n(t) \u2261 Q\u03c1\u03c3 (t) \u2212 Q\u03c1\u03c3 (\u2212t)\nT\n\n(15)\n\nwith \u03c1, \u03c3 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 and \u2206\u03c1\u03c3\n(t) = \u2206\u03c1\u03c3\n(t) 6= 0 when \u03b4 6= 0 and \u03c1 6= \u03c3.\nCP\nT\nIn Ref. [6] it was noticed that expanding the flavor fields in the same basis as the (free) fields with definite masses\n(cf. (9)) is actually a special choice, and that a more general possibility exists. In other words, in the expansion Eq.\n(9) one could use eigenfunctions with arbitrary masses \u03bc\u03c3 , and therefore not necessarily the same as the masses which\nappear in the Lagrangian. On this basis, the authors of Ref. [6] have generalized the BV formalism by writing the\nflavor fields as\nh\ni\nXZ\nr\u2020\nr\n\u03bd\u03c3 (x) =\nd3 k urk,\u03c3 \u03b1\nerk,\u03c3 (t) + v\u2212k,\u03c3\n\u03b2e\u2212k,\u03c3\n(t) eik*x ,\n(16)\nr\n\nwhere u\u03c3 and v\u03c3 are the helicity eigenfunctions with mass \u03bc\u03c3 . We denote by a tilde the generalized flavor operators\nintroduced in Ref. [6] in order to distinguish them from the ones in Eq.(9). The expansion Eq.(16) is more general\nthan the one in Eq.(9) since the latter corresponds to the particular choice \u03bce \u2261 m1 , \u03bc\u03bc \u2261 m2 . Of course, the flavor\nfields in Eq.(16) and Eq.(9) are the same fields. The relation, given in Ref. [6], between the general flavor operators\nand the BV ones is\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 r\n\u0012 r\n\u03b1\nek,\u03c3 (t)\n\u03b1k,\u03c3 (t)\n\u22121\nJ\u03bc (t) ,\n(17)\n=\nJ\n(t)\nr\u2020\nr\u2020\n\u03bc\n\u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t)\n\u03b2e\u2212k,\u03c3 (t)\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 X\nh\ni\uf8fd\nY\nr\u2020\nk\nr\nr\n\u03be\u03c3,j\n\u03b1r\u2020\n(18)\nJ\u03bc (t) =\nexp i\nk,\u03c3 (t)\u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t) + \u03b2\u2212k,\u03c3 (t)\u03b1k,\u03c3 (t) \uf8fe .\n\uf8f3\nk,r\n\n(\u03c3,j)\n\nk\nwith (\u03c3, j) = (e, 1), (\u03bc, 2), (\u03c4, 3), \u03be\u03c3,j\n\u2261 (\u03c7k\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c7kj )/2 and cot \u03c7k\u03c3 = |k|/\u03bc\u03c3 , cot \u03c7kj = |k|/mj . For \u03bc\u03c3 \u2261 mj , one has\nJ\u03bc (t) = 1.\nAs already noticed in Ref. [3], the flavor charge operators are the Casimir operators for the Bogoliubov transfore \u03c3 (t) = Q\u03c3 (t). This is obvious also from the fact\nmation (17), i.e. they are free from arbitrary mass parameters : Q\nthat they can be expressed in terms of flavor fields (see Ref. [5]).\nPhysical quantities should not carry any dependence on the \u03bc\u03c3 : in the two\u2013flavor case, it has been shown [3] that the\nexpectation values of the flavor charges on the neutrino states are free from the arbitrariness. For three generations,\nthe question is more subtle due to the presence of the CP violating phase. Indeed, in Ref. [7] it has been found that\nthe corresponding generalized quantities depend on arbitrary mass parameters. However, we find that:\nn\no2\n\b\n2\ne\u03c1 (t) = \u03b1\nQ\ne\u03c3 (t), \u03b1\ne\u2020\u03c1 (0)\n+ \u03b2e\u03c3\u2020 (t), \u03b1\ne\u2020\u03c1 (0)\n= Q\u03c1\u03c3 (t) + F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t)\n(19)\n\u03c3\n\ne\u03c1\u0304 (t) = \u2212\nQ\n\u03c3\n\nn\no\n\u03b2e\u03c3 (t), \u03b2e\u03c1\u2020 (0)\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nn\no\n\u03b1\ne\u2020\u03c3 (t), \u03b2e\u03c1\u2020 (0)\n\n2\n\n= Q\u03c1\u0304\u03c3 (t) + F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t), whose explicit form we do not report here for sake of shortness, goes to zero at t = 0. It can be\nshown that F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t) vanishes for \u03b4 = 0 and/or \u03bc\u03c1 = mj , (\u03c1, j) = (e, 1), (\u03bc, 2), (\u03c4, 3). This proves that the invariant\ne\u03c1 (t) \u2212 F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t) and Q\ne\u03c1\u0304 (t) \u2212 F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t) which in fact coincide with\n(physical) quantities in the generalized theory are Q\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n3\n\n\fthe oscillation formulae of Eqs.(11) and (12). In order to understand the origin of such an invariance, it would be\nuseful to obtain F (\u03bc\u03c1 , t) as expectation value of some operator. But this goes beyond the task of the present paper.\nWe remark that the quantities proposed in Ref. [7] as probabilities for flavor oscillations are ruled out by the present\nanalysis. Indeed, it was there shown that by using the retarded propagators one could arrive at the same oscillation\nformulae of the BV formalism. However, this coincidence holds only for two flavors since in the three flavor case, the\nquantity (Eq.(3.7) in Ref [7]):\n1\n(ret)\n(ret)\u2020\n(k; t)g\u03c1\u03c3\n(k; t)]\n(k; t) \u2261 Tr[g\u03c1\u03c3\nP\u03bd(ret)\n\u03c3 \u2192\u03bd\u03c1\n4\nh\n\b\n1X \b\n2\n+ \u03b2\u03c1\u2020 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c3 (0)\n\u03b1\u03c1 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c3 (0)\n=\n4 r\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+ |{\u03b1\u03c1 (t), \u03b2\u03c3 (0)}| +\n\n\b \u2020\n\u03b2\u03c1 (t), \u03b2\u03c3 (0)\n\n2\n\ni\n\n(21)\n\nis manifestly CP invariant and thus cannot be used as a correct QFT generalization of the QM oscillation formulae.\nThis is, on the other hand, also confirmed by the fact that the relativistic limit of the above expression does not give\nthe three flavor Pontecorvo formulae. On the contrary, we have shown that our formulae do exhibit all the expected\nfeatures in the presence of a CP violating phase and Pontecorvo formulae are recovered in the relativistic limit.\nFinally, we remark that the formulae Eqs.(11),(12) can be also obtained by use of the unordered Green's functions\n[2] as follows (Eq.(2.37) in Ref. [7]):\n\b\n\b\n1\n2\n2\n>\n>\u2020\n+ \u03b2\u03c1\u2020 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c3 (0)\n= Tr[G\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03b1\u03c1 (t), \u03b1\u2020\u03c3 (0)\n(k; t)G\u03c1\u03c3\n(k; t)]\n(22)\n2\nIn Ref. [7], it is observed that these quantities are generally dependent on the arbitrary mass parameters (in the case\none calculate the propagators within the generalized framework) and also that they can be interpreted as (oscillation)\nprobabilities since they satisfy the required boundary conditions. We have already shown how to renormalize the\nabove quantities with respect to the arbitrary mass parameters. As for the probabilistic interpretation, we need\nto stress that flavor states are essentially multiparticle ones and thus one cannot really talk of probabilities for the\nevolution of such states. Rather, the correct interpretation of our exact oscillation formulae is the one of Eqs.(11),(12),\ni.e. as expectation values of the flavor charges on states defined on the flavor Hilbert space. This is evident in the\nbosonic case, where the corresponding quantities can assume values larger than one as well as negative values [11,14].\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by MURST and INFN.
