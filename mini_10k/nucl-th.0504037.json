Isoscaling is the property that fragment yields\nof similar, but isotopically different, reactions depend exponentially on the neutron (N ) and proton (Z) numbers\nthrough R21 (N, Z) = Y2 (N, Z)/Y1 (N, Z) \u2248 Exp[\u03b1N + \u03b2Z], where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are fitting parameters.\nIn the past, this power law expression for R21 has been linked, under diverse approximations, to primary yields\nproduced by disassembling infinite equilibrated systems in microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles [4, 6], as\nwell as in canonical ensembles [7], and it has also been observed in the framework of the grand-canonical limit of\nthe statistical multifragmentation model [8], in the expanding-emitting source model [4], and in the antisymmetrized\nmolecular dynamics model [9]. Furthermore, under these approximations, the isoscaling parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 have been\nfound to be related to the symmetry term of the nuclear binding energy [5, 8], to the level of isospin equilibration [10],\nand to the values of transport coefficients [11].\nMore recently, however, it has been determined through the use of molecular dynamics [12] that isoscaling can exist\nin purely classical systems, and that it can be created in systems fully out of equilibrium. It was also found, among\nother things, that R21 can maintain the power-law behavior even when it contains yield contributions generated at\ndifferent times and corresponding to diverse thermodynamic conditions.\nThe implications of these findings are many and very important. Isoscaling is not a quantum process; \u03b2-decay, Pauli's\nexclusion principle and its implications for isospin selection cannot be possible causes of isoscaling. Isoscaling exists\nin finite systems out of equilibrium; expanding systems with rapidly varying temperatures and chemical potentials\nobey isoscaling. The isoscaling ratio, R21 , contains contributions from different times of the reaction; its final value\ndoes not necessarily correspond to the thermodynamic conditions of a period of the reaction. This, of course, if not\ninvalidates the scenarios and conclusions presented by previous studies, at least casts a shadow of doubt on them and,\nespecially, on the assumed physical meanings of the isoscaling parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nIn view of the present situation, the question that needs to be addressed remains the same as in our previous\nstudy [12], what produces isoscaling? Answering this question is now, in a way, simpler than in our previous work as\nmany reaction variables have been eliminated out of the search. After removing the need for quantum effects and for\nthermodynamic equilibrium, it is clear that isoscaling should, then, exist in systems with little more than protons and\nneutrons without specific interactions or dynamics. The origin of isoscaling must then lie in the sampling (i.e. mode\nof fragmentation) of a conglomerate of protons and neutrons and perhaps, since we are dealing with finite systems,\non its geometry and homogeneity.\nThis work aims at elucidating the origin of isoscaling by searching for this effect in a system with the bare minimum\nnumber of ingredients, namely bond percolation model. After presenting the model in the next section, results of the\npercolation of hundreds of thousands of three-dimensional grids are presented in section III, followed with a number\nof conclusions in section IV.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE PERCOLATION MODEL\n\nIn order to explore the behavior of isoscaling we use a three dimensional bond percolation model. This model was\nfirst applied in nuclear multifragmentation by Bauer et al. [13] and used by many groups [14, 15, 16, 17] ever since.\nIn the usual bond percolation model, a fragmenting nucleus is represented by a three-dimensional cubic lattice, and\nindividual \"nucleons\" by nodes on the lattice. All nodes start with bonds to all nearest-neighbors, which represent\nnucleon-nucleon interactions. These bonds are then attempted to be broken statistically according to a probability b,\nthus producing clusters of connected nodes which are interpreted as fragments.\nTo this usual model, we add the \"isospin\" of the nodes as an extra degree of freedom. With this method, lattices\nwith different ratios of \"protons\" and \"neutrons\" can be constructed and ruptured, producing cluster yields which\ncan then be used to construct the ratio R21 . Besides the usual assumptions of bond percolation, the following three\nconditions are added in this analysis: i) the bond breaking probability, b, is spatially homogeneous and identical for\npp, pn, and nn bonds, ii) the probability of a node for having isospin \"up\" (p) or \"down\" (n) is spatially homogeneous,\nand iii) the number of protons and neutrons is fixed from the beginning.\nA.\n\nGeometrical arguments leading to isoscaling\n\nIn this model, fragments are obtained when bonds are broken with a given probability b. If we consider the infinite\nsize limit is customary to express the number of fragments as the number of fragments per node\nNA\n= nA ,\nL\u2192\u221e L3\nlim\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L3 is the size of the lattice measured in nodes, NA is the number of fragments of size A, and nA the number\nof fragments of size A per node. This last quantity can be written in the following way\nX\ngAat (1 \u2212 b)a bt ,\n(2)\nnA =\na,t\n\nwhere t stands for the perimeter of the cluster (number of bonds to be broken in order to isolate the cluster composed\nby A nodes), and a is the number of bonds linking the A nodes, gAat is the number of cluster configurations with\nsize A, perimeter t and a activated bonds. As an illustration, figure 1 shows the different terms appearing in the\nexpression for n4 in the two dimensional case. The resulting expression for this term is\nn4 = 14(i \u2212 b)3 b10 + 4(1 \u2212 b)3 b9 + (1 \u2212 b)4 b8\n\n(3)\n\nTo include the isospin degree of freedom, a given node belonging to a cluster of size A will be considered to be a\nproton with probability p. Then\n\uf8f9\n\"\n#\uf8ee\nX\nX\nnA =\ngAt (1 \u2212 b)a bt \uf8f0\n\u03b1Z pZ (1 \u2212 p)(A\u2212Z) \uf8fb\n(4)\nt\n\nZ=0,A\n\nwith \u03b1Z being the number of ways of building a cluster with Z protons and N = A \u2212 Z neutrons: \u03b1Z = A!/N !Z! The\nnumber of fragments per node with A particles and Z protons is then defined as:\nnA,Z = nA [\u03b1Z pZ q (A\u2212Z) ] = nA \u03b1Z pZ q N .\n\n(5)\n\nFocusing now on the isoscaling problem, the quantity of interest is the quotient:\nR21 =\n\nY2 (A, Z)\nY1 (A, Z)\n\n(6)\n\nWith Y2 representing the yield for the reaction involving the neutron rich nuclei.\nFor the percolation model, R21 takes the form\nR21\n\n[nA,Z ]2\npZ q N\n=\n= 2Z 2N =\n[nA,Z ]1\np1 q1\n\n\u0012\n\np2\np1\n\n\u0013Z \u0012\n\nq2\nq1\n\n\u0013N\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Cluster structures in two dimensional percolation. In this figure we show the 6 possible realizations of clusters of size\n4 in a two dimensional grid. Circles denote nodes, straight lines denote active links. Together with each diagram we show the\ncorresponding term in the sum n4 .\n\nin which all the geometrical and combinatorial terms cancel out and only the part related to the occupancy probabilities\nremains. In this way\n( \"\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 #)\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nZ\nN\np2\nq2\nq2\np2\nR21 = exp ln\n= exp N ln\n+ Z ln\n= exp (\u03b1N + \u03b2Z) .\n(8)\np1\nq1\nq1\np1\nWhich is the standard expression of the isoscaling coefficient, but now with a clear microscopic interpretation for the\nisoscaling parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nFor finite lattices, it is convenient to study R21 calculated in terms of the number of fragments NA,Z instead of\nthe above derivation in terms of the number of fragments per node, nA,Z . This can be achieved by using the above\nderived expressions for the constants \u03b1 and \u03b2. Equation (7) can be rewritten as\nR21 =\n\n[NA,Z ]2\nA2 Z\nA2 [nA,Z ]2\n=\n\u2248\n[NA,Z ]1\nA1 [nA,Z ]1\nZ A1\n\n\u0012\n\np2\np1\n\n\u0013Z \u0012\n\nq2\nq1\n\n\u0013N\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\np2\np1\n\n\u0013Z\u22121 \u0012\n\nq2\nq1\n\n\u0013N\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nwhere the probabilities have been approximated by pi \u2243 Z/Ai . This immediately yields the usual expression:\nR21 = C exp (\u03b1N + \u03b2Z)\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b1 = ln(q2 /q1 ), \u03b2 = ln(p2/ p1 ) and C = exp[ln(p1 /p2 )] = p1 /p2 = A2 /A1\nIt should be kept in mind that the main assumptions in this derivation are that the probability p is homogenous\nand that the number of fragments per node (per particle) can be approximated by the corresponding infinite size\nlimit. We now turn to a numerical verification of these predictions.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS\n\nTo explore the isoscaling phenomena in the framework of the above defined percolation model, two different types\nof calculations were performed: fixing the number of protons in the lattice, and using a fixed probability to assign the\nisospin to the nodes.\nA.\n\nFixed proton number\n\nIn this case, the R21 was obtained using the yields of two lattices, one of size 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6, i.e. with A = 216 nodes,\nand a second one of 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 with A = 343 nodes, both with the number of protons fixed to 108. These grids, had,\nthen, Z = N = 108, and probabilities p1 = 0.5 and q1 = (1 \u2212 p1 ) = 0.5 for the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 grid, and Z = 108, N = 235,\np2 = 0.315 and q2 = (1 \u2212 p2 ) = 0.685, for the 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 grid.\nFor these probabilities, the isoscaling coefficients are \u03b1 = ln(0.6852/0.5) = 0.315 and \u03b2 = ln(0.3148/0.5) = \u22120.463,\nand the constant C = p1 /p2 = 0.5/0.3148 = 1. 588 3. The results of 200, 000 percolations of each of these grids are\ndisplayed in panel a) of figure 2.\nB.\n\nFixed p and n occupancy probability\n\nIn this second case, the two isotopically different grids were constructed with the same sizes for both, but with two\ndifferent protons and neutrons occupation probabilities. Several cases were studied.\nFirst, 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 grids were constructed using p1 = 0.5 and q1 = (1 \u2212 p1 ) = 0.5 which yields a total number of protons\n(in average) of hZi = 108 and hN i = 108, and p2 = 0.33 and q2 = (1 \u2212 p2 ) = 0.67 which yields a total number of\nprotons (in average) of hZi = 72 and hN i = 144. In this case the coefficients are : \u03b1 = ln(0.67/0.5) = 0.292 67, and\n\u03b2 = ln(0.33/0.5) = \u22120.415 52. The results obtained from this numerical exercise are displayed in panel b) of figure 2;\nthe fact that isoscaling is well reproduced by this purely geometrical model is obvious from this figure.\nNext, to investigate size effects, a similar case was constructed using a smaller lattice of size 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 with the\nsame probabilities as in the previous case. The corresponding results are displayed in panel c) of figure 2; again the\nproperty of isoscaling is apparent.\nFinally, to investigate the effect of different occupation probabilities on R21 , one more case was studied. In this\ncase, a lattice of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 was populated with protons and neutrons according to the probabilities: p1 = 0.5 and\nq1 = (1 \u2212 p1 ) = 0.5. For the neutron rich partner the probabilities used were p2 = 0.42 and q2 = (1 \u2212 p2 ) = 0.58\nwhich yields a total number of protons (on average) of hZi = 91 and hN i = 125. In this case the coefficients are\n\u03b1 = ln(0.58/0.5) = 0.148 42, and \u03b2 = ln(0.42/0.5) = \u22120.174 35. The corresponding results are shown in panel d) of\nfigure 2.\nFor each of these cases 200, 000 configurations were generated. The bond breaking probability was chosen as b = 0.31\nin order to get good statistics in an ample range of masses. [Attempts with different values of the breaking probability\nb demonstrated that the ratio R21 is independent of b.] The figure also shows a comparison of the numerical results\nto the theoretical predictions of section III, lines denote theoretical predictions whereas symbols denote numerical\nsimulations. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and the results of the simulations is remarkable.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the isoscaling phenomenon in the frame of percolation model. We have derived exact analytic\nexpressions for the infinite case and approximate ones for the finite case. We have performed numerical simulations for\nnot too big systems (125, 216 and 343 \"particles\") with different relative populations of N:Z.

Comparison of theoretical predictions for isoscaling in the nuclear percolation model and the\ncorresponding results from numerical simulations. Lines denote theoretical predictions, symbols denote numerical simulations\n\nbetween numerical simulations and theory indicate that isoscaling emerges from the simple assumption of fair sampling\nwith homogeneous probabilities. On the other hand, this property can be seen as a minimum information approach,\ni.e. all configurations are equiprobable, as such this analysis can be interpreted in the frame of a maximum entropy\napproach. This indicates that the information about effects due, for example, to the asymmetry term in the equation\nof state, is in the absolute values of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, and not in the isoscaling property itself.\nAcknowledgments\n\nC.O.D. acknowledges the support of Universidad de Buenos Aires through grant x139, CONICET through grant\n2041, and the hospitality of the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\n[1] H.
