The small residual fraction of free electrons after cosmological recombination coupled the temperature of the cosmic gas to that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) down to a redshift, z \u223c 200\n[1]. Subsequently, the gas temperature dropped adiabatically as Tgas \u221d (1 + z)2 below the CMB temperature\nT\u03b3 \u221d (1 + z). The gas heated up again after being exposed to the photo-ionizing ultraviolet light emitted by\nthe first stars during the reionization epoch at z <\n\u223c 20 (see\nreview in [2]). Prior to the formation of the first stars, the\ncosmic neutral hydrogen must have resonantly absorbed\nthe CMB flux through its spin-flip 21cm transition [3\u20136].\nThe linear density fluctuations at that time should have\nimprinted anisotropies on the CMB sky at an observed\nwavelength of 21.12[(1 + z)/100] meters. In this Letter,\nwe calculate the power spectrum of these anisotropies and\nassess the significance of their potential detection. A direct measurement of the amplitude of inhomogeneities on\nsmall spatial scales would constrain any possible tilt or\nrunning of the spectral index of the power spectrum as\nrecently suggested by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) [7], or any suppression of power on small\nscales due to a warm dark matter component in the cosmic mass budget [8].\nSpin temperature history. We start by calculating the\nhistory of the spin temperature, Ts , defined through\nthe ratio between the number densities of hydrogen\natoms in the excited and ground state levels, n1 /n0 =\n(g1 /g0 ) exp {\u2212T\u22c6 /Ts } , where subscripts 1 and 0 correspond to the excited and ground state levels of the 21cm\ntransition, (g1 /g0 ) = 3 is the ratio of the spin degeneracy factors of the levels, nH = (n0 + n1 ) \u221d (1 + z)3 is the\ntotal hydrogen density, and T\u22c6 = 0.068K is the temperature corresponding to the energy difference between the\nlevels. The time evolution of the density of atoms in the\nground state is given by,\n\n\u2202t + 3\n\n\u0227\na\n\n\u0013\n\nn0 = \u2212n0 (C01 + B01 I\u03bd )\n\n+n1 (C10 + A10 + B10 I\u03bd ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a(t) = (1 + z)\u22121 is the cosmic scale factor, A's\nand B's are the Einstein rate coefficients, C's are the\ncollisional rate coefficients, and I\u03bd is the blackbody intensity in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the CMB, namely\nI\u03bd = 2kB T\u03b3 /\u03bb2 with \u03bb = 21 cm [9]. The 0 \u2192 1 transition rates can be related to the 1 \u2192 0 transition rates\nby the requirement that in thermal equilibrium with\nTs = T\u03b3 = Tgas , the right-hand-side of Eq. (1) should\nvanish with the collisional terms balancing each other\nseparately from the radiative terms. The Einstein coefficients are A10 = 2.85 \u00d7 10\u221215 s\u22121 , B10 = (\u03bb3 /2hc)A10\nand B01 = (g1 /g0 )B10 [3,9]. The collisional de-excitation\nrates can be written as C10 = 34 \u03ba(1\u22120)nH , where \u03ba(1\u22120)\nis tabulated as a function of Tgas [10].\nEquation (1) can be simplified to the form,\nd\u03a5\n\u22121\n= \u2212 [H(1 + z)] [\u2212\u03a5(C01 + B01 I\u03bd )\ndz\n+(1 \u2212 \u03a5)(C10 + A10 + B10 I\u03bd )] ,\n(2)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a5 \u2261 n0 /nH , H \u2248 H0 \u03a9m (1 + z)3/2 is the Hubble\nparameter at high redshifts (with a present-day value of\nH0 ), and \u03a9m is the density parameter of matter. The\nupper panel of Fig. 1 shows the results of integrating\nEq. (2). Both the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature of the gas track the CMB temperature down to\nz \u223c 200. Collisions are efficient at coupling Ts and Tgas\ndown to z \u223c 70 and so the spin temperature follows the\nkinetic temperature around that redshift. At much lower\nredshifts, the Hubble expansion makes the collision rate\nsubdominant relative the radiative coupling rate to the\nCMB, and so Ts tracks T\u03b3 again. Consequently, there is\n<\na redshift window between 30 <\n\u223c z \u223c 200, during which\n1\n\n\fThe resulting brightness temperature fluctuations can be\nrelated to the derivative,\n\nthe cosmic hydrogen absorbs the CMB flux at its resonant 21cm transition. Coincidentally, this redshift interval precedes the appearance of collapsed objects [2] and\nso its signatures are not contaminated by nonlinear density structures or by radiative or hydrodynamic feedback\neffects from stars and quasars.\n\n\u03b4Ts\ndTb\nT\u03b3 T\u0304b\n,\n\u2261 T\u0304b +\nd\u03b4H\n(T\u0304s \u2212 T\u03b3 ) T\u0304s \u03b4H\n\nthrough \u03b4Tb = (dTb /d\u03b4H )\u03b4H . We include all fluctuations caused by \u03b4H except for the variation in Cij due\nto fluctuations in Tgas which is very small [10]. Figure\n1 shows dTb /d\u03b4H as a function of redshift, including the\ntwo contributions to dTb /d\u03b4H , one originating directly\nfrom density fluctuations and the second from the associated changes in the spin temperature [4]. Both contributions have the same sign, because an increase in density\nraises the collision rate and lowers the spin temperature\nand so it allows Ts to better track Tgas . Since \u03b4H grows\nwith time as \u03b4H \u221d a, the signal peaks at z \u223c 50, a slightly\nlower redshift than the peak of dTb /d\u03b4H .\nNext we calculate the angular power spectrum of the\nbrightness temperature on the sky, resulting from density\nperturbations with a power spectrum P\u03b4 (k),\nh\u03b4H (k1 )\u03b4H (k2 )i = (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4 D (k1 + k2 )P\u03b4 (k1 ).\n\nFIG. 1.

An excess of neutral\nhydrogen directly increases the optical depth and also alters the evolution of the spin temperature. We can write\nan equation for the resulting evolution of \u03a5 fluctuations,\n\nOur calculation ignores inhomogeneities in the hydrogen\nionization fraction, since they freeze at the earlier recombination epoch (z \u223c 103 ) and so their amplitude is more\nthan an order of magnitude smaller than \u03b4H at z <\n\u223c 100.\nThe peculiar velocity and gravitational potential perturbations induce redshift distortion effects that are of order\n\u223c (H/ck) and \u223c (H/ck)2 smaller than \u03b4H for the high\u2013l\nmodes of interest here.

Interestingly,\nthe cosmological Jeans mass reaches its minimum value,\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 104M\u2299 , within the redshift interval of interest here\n[2]. During the epoch of reionization, photoionization\nheating raises the Jeans mass by several orders of magnitude and and broadens spectral features, thus limiting\nthe ability of other probes of the intergalactic medium,\nsuch as the Ly\u03b1 forest, from accessing the same very low\nmass scales. The 21cm tomography has the additional\nadvantage of probing the majority of the cosmic gas, instead of the trace amount (\u223c 10\u22125 ) of neutral hydrogen\nprobed by the Ly\u03b1 forest after reionization. Similarly to\nthe primary CMB anisotropies, the 21cm signal is simply\nshaped by gravity, adiabatic cosmic expansion, and wellknown atomic physics, and is not contaminated by complex astrophysical processes that affect the intergalactic\nmedium at z <\n\u223c 30.\nThe small scale power spectrum. In most models of\ninflation, the evolution of the Hubble parameter during\ninflation leads to departures from a scale-invariant spectrum that are of order 1/Nefold with Nefold \u223c 60 being\nthe number of e\u2013folds between the time when the scale of\nour horizon was of order the horizon during inflation and\nthe end of inflation [14]. Recent WMAP data combined\nwith other measures of the power on smaller scales, suggests that the power spectrum changes with scale much\nfaster than inflation would have predicted [7], although\nthis result is still somewhat controversial. Independent\nhints that the standard \u039bCDM model may have too much\npower on galactic scales have inspired several proposals\nfor suppressing the power on small scales. Examples include the possibility that the dark matter is warm and it\n\nFIG. 3.

The 21cm signal contains a wealth of information about the initial fluctuations. A full sky map at a single photon frequency measured up to lmax , can probe the power spectrum up to\n2\nkmax \u223c (lmax /104 )Mpc\u22121 . Such a map contains lmax\nindependent samples. By shifting the photon frequency,\none may obtain many independent measurements of the\npower. When measuring a mode l, which corresponds\nto a wavenumber k \u223c l/r, two maps at different photon\nfrequencies will be independent if they are separated in\nradial distance by 1/k. Thus, an experiment that covers\na spatial range \u2206r can probe a total of k\u2206r \u223c l\u2206r/r independent maps. An experiment that detects the 21cm\nsignal over a range \u2206\u03bd centered on a frequency \u03bd, is sensitive to \u2206r/r \u223c 0.5(\u2206\u03bd/\u03bd)(1 + z)\u22121/2 , and so it measures\n3\n\n\fa total of N21cm \u223c 3\u00d71016 (lmax /106 )3 (\u2206\u03bd/\u03bd)(z/100)\u22121/2\nindependent samples.\nThis detection capability cannot be reproduced even\nremotely by other techniques. For example, the primary CMB anisotropies are damped on small scales\n(through the so-called Silk damping), and probe only\nmodes with l \u2264 3000 (k \u2264 0.2 Mpc\u22121 ). The total num2\nber of modes available in the full sky is Ncmb = 2lmax\n\u223c\n7\n2\n2 \u00d7 10 (lmax /3000) , including both temperature and polarization information.\nDetectability of signal. The sensitivity of an experiment depends strongly on its particular design, involving\nthe number and distribution of the antennae for an interferometer. Crudely speaking, the uncertainty in the\nmeasurement of [l(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0]1/2 is dominated by noise,\nN\u03bd , which is controlled by the sky brightness I\u03bd at the\nobserved frequency \u03bd [6],\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n5000\nlmin\n0.016\nI\u03bd\nN\u03bd \u223c 0.4mK\n5 \u00d7 105 Jy sr\u22121\n35\nlmax\nfcover\n\u0013\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u00135/2\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u0012\n50 MHz\n\u2206\u03bd\n1 year\n,\n(11)\n\u00d7\nt0\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nwhere lmin is the minimum observable l as determined\nby the field of view of the instruments, lmax is the maximum observable l as determined by the maximum separation of the antennae, fcover is the fraction of the array area thats is covered by telescopes, t0 is the observation time and \u2206\u03bd is the frequency range over which\nthe signal can be detected. The numbers adopted above\nare appropriate for the inner core of the LOFAR array (http://www.lofar.org), planned for initial operation in 2006. The predicted signal is \u223c 1mK, and\nso a year of integration or an increase in the covering fraction are required to observe it with LOFAR.\nOther experiments whose goal is to detect 21cm fluctuations include SKA (http://www.skatelescope.org) and\nPAST (http://astrophysics.phys.cmu.edu/\u223cjbp).\nThe\nmain challenge in detecting the predicted signal involves\nits appearance at low frequencies where the sky noise\nis high. Proposed space-based instruments [18] avoid\nthe terrestrial radio noise and the increasing atmospheric\n>\nopacity at \u03bd <\n\u223c 20 MHz (corresponding to z \u223c 70).\nFinal comments. The 21cm absorption is replaced by\n21cm emission from neutral hydrogen as soon as the intergalactic medium is heated above the CMB temperature during the epoch of reionization [13]. Once most of\nthe cosmic hydrogen is reionized at zreion , the 21cm signal\nis diminished. The optical depth for free-free absorption\nafter reionization, \u223c 0.1[(1 + zreion)/20]5/2 , modifies only\nslightly the expected 21cm anisotropies. Gravitational\nlensing should modify the power spectrum [12] at high l,\nbut can be separated as in standard CMB studies (see [19]\nand references therein). The 21cm signal should be simpler to clean as it includes the same lensing foreground\nin independent maps obtained at different frequencies.\n4\n\nThe large number of independent modes probed by the\n21cm signal would provide a measure of non-Gaussian\n\u22121/2\ndeviations to a level of \u223c N21cm , constituting a test of\nthe inflationary origin of the primordial inhomogeneities\n\u22126\nwhich are expected to possess deviations >\n\u223c 10 [20].\nAcknowledgments.
