It elucidates the meaning of time and kinematics in cosmology. The Milne model offers also an interesting insight\ninto all Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We begin in\nSec. 2 by deriving the angular diameter distance for\nan empty universe using the FRW framework. Next,\nwe present the corresponding derivation in the Milne\nmodel. In Sec. 3 we derive the luminosity distance in\nthe Milne model and compare it to the angular diameter distance. Finally, in Sec. 4 we present the resulting magnitude\u2013redshift diagram for supernovae Ia. We\nsummarize in Sec. 5.\n\nIn a recent paper, Davis & Lineweaver (2004) attempted to clarify several common misconceptions about the\nexpansion of the universe. In particular, they convincingly pointed out that uniform expansion of an infinite\nuniverse implies that very distant galaxies recede from\nus with superluminal (faster-than-light) recession velocities. Moreover, we can observe such galaxies. This\ndoes not violate special relativity (SR), because their\nvelocities are not measured in any observer's inertial\nframe. They are measured in the so-called reference\nframe of Fundamental Observers, for which the universe looks homogeneous and isotropic.\nUnfortunately, Davis & Lineweaver not only clarified some misconceptions; they also created a new\nmisunderstanding. They claimed to \"observationally\nrule out the SR Doppler interpretation of cosmological\nredshifts at a confidence level of 23\u03c3.\" (The specialrelativistic interpretation of redshift is kinematic, i.e.,\nthe Doppler effect.) As we will explain later, Davis\n& Lineweaver did not apply SR properly. Specifically,\nthey did not consistently use the definition of the luminosity distance, DL . SR is known to describe the\ndynamics of an empty universe (Peacock 1999; Longair\n2003). Their error led Davis & Lineweaver to an expression for the luminosity distance as a function of\nredshift that was entirely different from that for an\nempty universe.\nIn the framework of general relativity, the calculation of DL for an empty universe is straightforward.\nHowever, here we will present also an alternative approach, based entirely on SR. Namely, we will derive DL applying the kinematic cosmological model\nof Milne (1933). This approach is useful for readers\n\n2\n\nAngular diameter distance\n\nFor comparison, let us first recall the derivation of the\nangular diameter distance for an empty universe in the\nFRW framework. The metric of a homogeneous and\nisotropic universe is given by the Robertson\u2013Walker\nline element:\nc2 ds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)[dx2 + Ro2 S 2 (x/Ro )d\u03a9].\n\n(1)\n\nHere,\nd\u03a9 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\nRo\u22122\n\n(2)\n\nand\nis the (present) curvature of the universe.\nThe function S(x) equals sin(x), x, and sinh(x) for\na closed, flat, and open universe, respectively. The\nfunction a(t) is called a scale factor and relates the\nphysical, or proper, coordinates of a galaxy, r, to its\nfixed or comoving coordinates, x: r = ax. This function accounts for the expansion of the universe; its\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\ndetailed time dependence is determined by the Friedman equations. We normalize a so that at the present\ntime, a(to ) = 1. For an open universe, the Friedman\nequations yield\n\nwhere z is the photons' redshift; hence,\n\ncHo\u22121\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9o )1/2\n\nRo =\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Ho is the present value of the Hubble constant\nand \u03a9o is the present value of the total (energy) density in the universe, in units of the so-called critical\n(energy) density.\nLet us work out the angular size of an object of\nproper length \u2206y, perpendicular to the radial coordinate at redshift z. The relevant spatial component of\nthe metric (1)\u2013(2) is the term in d\u03b8. The proper length\n\u2206y of an object at redshift z, corresponding to scale\nfactor a(te ), for an open universe is\n\u2206y = a(te )Ro sinh(x/Ro )\u2206\u03b8 = DA \u2206\u03b8,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have introduced the angular diameter distance DA = a(te )Ro sinh(x/Ro ). Here, te is the time\nof emission of photons. Since a(te )\u22121 = 1 + z, we have\nDA = Ro sinh(x/Ro )/(1 + z).\n\n(5)\ncHo\u22121 .\n\nFor an empty universe, \u03a9o = 0, hence Ro =\nMoreover, then a(t) = Ho t and the equations of null\nradial geodesics are easy to integrate. The result is x =\ncHo\u22121 ln(1+z). Substituting this into equation (5) and\nusing the definition of the hyperbolic sine, we obtain\nDA (z) = cHo\u22121\n\nz(1 + z/2)\n.\n(1 + z)2\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b2=\n\n(1 + z)2 \u2212 1\n.\n(1 + z)2 + 1\n\n(12)\n\nUsing equation (12) in (10) yields\nre = cto\n\nz(1 + z/2)\n.\n(1 + z)2\n\n(13)\n\nSince in the Milne model, for any time t and for any\nfundamental observer Fv , r = v t, the observer at O\nobserves the Hubble flow: v = Hr, where the Hubble\nconstant is H = t\u22121 . Hence, to = Ho\u22121 . The angular\ndiameter distance is defined via the equation \u2206y =\nDA \u2206\u03c6. Therefore, using equation (7) we obtain finally\nDA (z) = re = cHo\u22121\n\nz(1 + z/2)\n.\n(1 + z)2\n\n(14)\n\nIn the above derivation we have applied special relativity a number of times. First, writing Eq. (9) we\nhave followed its central assumption, that the velocity\nof light is always c, regardless the relative motion of the\nemitter and the observer. Secondly, we have applied\nthe special-relativistic, kinematic interpretation of redshift \u2013 i.e., the Doppler effect \u2013 and used formula (11)\nfor it. Finally, writing Eq. (7) we have assumed that\nthe geometry of space is Euclidean.\nEq. (14) exactly coincides with formula (6) for DA\nfor an empty universe, the latter derived from the metric in its FRW form. Our second derivation, which\nwas purely special-relativistic, employed other (i.e.,\nconventional Minkowskian) definitions of distance and\ntime. Still, we arrived at the same formula for DA .\nThis is so because this formula relates direct observables: proper (i.e., rest-frame) size of an object to its\nangular size and redshift. Regardless of what are the\ndefinitions of coordinates in a given coordinate system,\ntheir consistent application should lead to the same result in terms of observables!\n\nThis is the angular diameter distance for an empty\nuniverse, derived in the FRW framework.\nIn the Milne model, the cosmic arena of physical events is the pre-existing Minkowski spacetime. In\nthe origin of the coordinate system, O, at time t = 0\nan 'explosion' takes place, sending radially fundamental observers with constant velocities in the range of\nspeeds (0, c). The fundamental observer with velocity\nv, Fv , carries a rigid rod of length \u2206y, oriented perpendicularly to the line of sight of the observer at O.\nAt time te this rod emits photons. At the photons'\narrival time at O, to , the rod subtends at O an angle\n\nThe relation between the luminosity distance, DL , and\nthe angular diameter distance is\n\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u2206y/re ,\n\nDL = (1 + z)2 DA .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere re is the distance from O to Fv at the time of\nemission of the photons, te . We have to = te + tt ,\nwhere tt is the travel time of the photons. Since\nre\nte =\n(8)\nv\nand\ntt =\n\nre\n,\nc\n\n(9)\n\nwe obtain\n\n\u03b2\n,\n(10)\n1+\u03b2\nwhere \u03b2 = v/c. The special-relativistic formula for the\nDoppler effect is\nre = cto\n\n1+z =\n\n\u0012\n\n1+\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n3\n\nLuminosity distance\n\n(15)\n\nHowever, this is true in general relativity; let's check\nwhether this holds also in the Milne model. Let's place\na source of radiation at the origin of the coordinate\nsystem, O. We assume again that at time t = 0 at O an\n'explosion' takes place, sending radially fundamental\nobservers with constant velocities in the range of (0, c).\nAt time te the source emits photons, which at time to\nreach a fundamental observer moving with velocity v,\nsuch that\nvto = c(to \u2212 te ).\n(16)\nIf the source emits continuously photons with constant\nbolometric luminosity L, the observer at ro = vto receives a flux of radiation with bolometric intensity\nf=\n\nL\n.\n4\u03c0ro2 (1 + z)2\n\n(17)\n\n\f3\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nThe factor (1 + z)2 in the denominator is due to the\nDoppler effect. Specifically, one factor 1 + z is due\nto the fact that the wavelength, and so the energy, of\nthe observed photons is redshifted. The second factor\n1 + z is due to the fact that photons, emitted in the\ntime interval \u2206te , arrive to the observer in the time\ninterval to = (1 + z)\u2206te .\nThe luminosity distance is defined by the equation\n2\nf = L/(4\u03c0DL\n), hence\nDL = (1 + z)ro = (1 + z)c\u03b2to .\n\n(18)\n\nTime to is the time of observation indicated by the\nclock at the source, but the fundamental observer is\nmoving with respect to O, so according to SR, his\nclock delays compared to that at O. At the moment\nof observation, his clock shows time \u03c4o = to /\u03b3, where\n\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 . Therefore, we have\nDL = (1 + z)c\u03c4o \u03b2\u03b3.\n\n(19)\n\nRelative to the observer, however, this is the source\nthat is moving. Using his clock, the observer deduces\nthat since the Big-Bang, the source has moved off to\nthe distance ro\u2032 = v\u03c4o . Because the source is moving, the distance ro\u2032 is length-contracted relative to its\nrest-frame value, ro : ro\u2032 = ro /\u03b3. Hence, the observer\nwill agree that ro = \u03b3v\u03c4o = c\u03c4o \u03b2\u03b3, what yields equation (19).\nNext, we have\n\u03b2\u03b3 =\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n,\n= (1 + z)\n1+\u03b2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)1/2 (1 + \u03b2)1/2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere in the last equality we have used the SR formula for redshift, Eq. (11). Combined with Eq. (12),\nEqs. (19)\u2013(20) yield\nDL = (1 + z)2 c\u03c4o\n\nrelative to O and R denotes the position of O\u2032 relative\nto O. Hence, v\u2032 = Ho (r \u2212 R) = Ho r\u2032 , where r\u2032 is the\nposition of O\u2032\u2032 relative to O\u2032 . Thus, the observer O\u2032\nobserves an isotropic Hubble flow around him, so he\nis apparently at the center of expansion. The point\nis that this result holds also for relativistic velocities\n(Milne 1933; Rindler 1977). Strictly speaking, in the\nHubble law the Hubble constant is an inverse of the\nlocal proper time of the observer at O\u2032 . This is why in\nEq. (21) we have identified Ho with \u03c4o\u22121 .\nIt is rather surprising why Milne, who insisted so\nmuch on an observables-oriented approach to cosmology, did not derive himself an explicit formula for the\nluminosity distance as a function of redshift. We will\nsee, however, that he was close to it. The Appendix\nto his classical paper on kinematic relativity (Milne\n1933) bears the title \"The apparent brightness of a receding nebula\". Its final formula (16) describes \"the\ntotal light received by A (the observer) on his own\nphotographic plate\" in a fairly complex, integral form.\nThis formula involves implicitly the luminosity distance, but in terms of the recession velocity of the nebula rather than its redshift. However, while the redshift of a distant nebula is a direct observable, its velocity is not. Extracting the luminosity distance from\nthe formula and using the SR relation between velocity and redshift, Eq. (11), we rederive the formula for\nthe luminosity distance given by our Eq. (21).\n\n4\n\nThe apparent bolometric magnitude, mB , of a standard candle located at redshift z is related to its absolute bolometric magnitude, M , by the equation\n\nz(1 + z/2)\n= cHo\u22121 z(1 + z/2). (21)\n(1 + z)2\n\nComparing with Eq. (14) we see that indeed DL =\n(1 + z)2 DA , in accordance with general relativity.\nTo derive the angular diameter distance, in Sec. 2\nwe have used the observer's rest-frame. To derive the\nluminosity distance, however, in the present section\nwe have switched to the source's rest-frame. We have\ndone so for simplicity of the resulting calculations. In\nparticular, only in the latter frame is the radiation of\nthe source isotropic, and one can apply simple equation (17) for the observed flux.\nDeriving the two distances, we have placed either\nthe observer or the source at a special position: at\nthe center of expansion. Are then our results general? Yes: although in the Milne model this center\ndoes indeed exist, every fundamental observer considers himself to be at the center of expansion! This can\nbe easily seen in the non-relativistic regime. According\nto the Galilean transformation of velocities, the velocity of any observer O\u2032\u2032 relative to another observer O\u2032\nis v\u2032 = v \u2212 Vrel , where v and Vrel are respectively the\nvelocity of O\u2032\u2032 relative to O and the velocity of O\u2032 relative to O. But by the construction of the model, the\nobserver at O observes the Hubble flow, so v = Ho r\nand Vrel = Ho R, where r denotes the position of O\u2032\u2032\n\nApparent magnitude \u2013 redshift relation\n\nmB = 5 log 10 DL + 25 + M.\n\n(22)\n\nHere, DL is the luminosity distance, expressed in megaparsecs (Mpc). Supernovae Ia turned out to be very\ngood standard candles in the universe (see, for example, Perlmutter 2003). Perlmutter et al.

The thin solid line shows\nthe prediction of special relativity according to Davis\n& Lineweaver. The dotted line shows the correct prediction of special relativity.\n\nTo derive the luminosity distance DL = (1 + z)D,\nDavis & Lineweaver used the Hubble law:\nD = cH \u22121 \u03b2.\n\nComparing with Eq. (18) we see that this leads to\nthe correct expression for DL provided we identify H\n(s)\nwith Ho , i.e. the value of the Hubble constant at\nthe source and at the time of observation of photons.\n(s)\nHowever, they identified H with He , i.e. the Hubble\nconstant at the source but at the time of emission of\nphotons:\n\n\u0002\n\nD(DL) = c He(s)\n\n\u0003\u22121\n\n\u03b2 = c\u03b2te .\n\n(29)\n\nCombined with the SR expression for \u03b2 as a function\nof redshift, Eq.

First, He =\n(o)\n\u22121\n\u22121\nte and Ho = \u03c4o , where t and \u03c4 are the time measured (by Fundamental Observers) respectively at the\nsource and at the observing point.

(35)\u2013(36) we see that they indeed imply Eq. (31). Once again, we have found that\nthe Milne model exactly describes the dynamics of an\nempty universe.\nComparing equation (29) with (18) we see that\nequation (29) leads to an expression for the luminosity\ndistance which underestimates the correct one by the\nfactor of to /te . We have to /te = (to /\u03c4o ) * (\u03c4o /te ) =\n\u03b3(1 + z) = [(1 + z)2 + 1]/2. Using Eq. (31) in Eq.

(25), Eq. (38) yields the function\nshown in Fig. 1 as a thin solid line. Davis & Lineweaver\ndid not provide an explicit formula for the magnitude\u2013\nredshift relation in SR, but this line closely follows\ntheir plotted curve.\nThe thick solid line in Fig. 1 shows the magnitude\u2013\nredshift relation for the currently favored cosmological\nmodel: a flat universe with a nonzero cosmological constant, \u03a9m = 0.28 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.72.1 Useful expressions\nfor the luminosity distance in this model are given in\nChodorowski (2005). We see that the thin solid line\n(prediction of SR according to Davis & Lineweaver)\nis very distant from the thick solid line. Using the\nsupernovae data of Perlmutter et al. (1999), Davis &\nLineweaver verified that the model given by the thin\nline \"is ruled out at more than 23\u03c3\" compared with\nthe currently favored model.\nOn the other hand, the dotted line (correct prediction of SR) follows the thick solid line much more\nclosely. Given the data by Perlmutter et al. (1999),\n1 These are recent estimates of the cosmological parameters \u03a9m and \u03a9\u039b from the magnitude\u2013redshift relation of\nobserved high-redshift supernovae, combined with other\nobservational constraints. See, for example, Tonry et al.\n(2003).\n\n\f5\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nhow close is the prediction of SR to that of the favored model? The answer is provided by Perlmutter et al. themselves: their analysis yielded the constraint 0.8\u03a9m \u2212 0.6\u03a9\u039b = \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.1. An empty universe corresponds to \u03a9m = \u03a9\u039b = 0, hence for SR,\n0.8\u03a9m \u2212 0.6\u03a9\u039b = 0. We see thus that within two\nstandard deviations, the data was consistent with an\nempty universe! This is not to defend this model as\na viable alternative to the currently favored model.\nFrom our mere existence we know the universe is not\nempty. A host of observational evidence consistently\npoints towards the currently favored model. This is\nonly to say that a few years ago, the evidence from supernovae data alone for the accelerated expansion of\nthe universe was not so strong, and the assumption of\nits purely kinematic expansion at low redshifts could\nthen serve as a reasonable starting approximation.\nSince the year 1999 the supernovae Ia data has\nimproved. In particular, the analysis of Tonry et al.\n(2003) yielded \u03a9\u039b \u2212 1.4\u03a9m = 0.35 \u00b1 0.14. This constituted a modest improvement over the result of Perlmutter et al., implying the present acceleration of the\nuniverse's expansion to be detected at a 2.5\u03c3 confidence.2 A significant improvement was achieved by\ndiscovering and observing supernovae Ia at z > 1 with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. Fig. 8 of Riess et al.\n(2004) shows the resulting joint confidence intervals\nfor (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b ) from SNe Ia. In this figure, the point\n\u03a9m = \u03a9\u039b = 0 lies outside shown confidence contours\nof 99.7%. Riess et al. claim that \"with the current\nsample, the 4\u03c3 confidence intervals (i.e., > 99.99%\nconfidence) are now fully contained within the region\nwhere \u03a9\u039b > 0.\" Similar results of the analysis of the\nRiess et al. sample have been obtained independently\nby Wright (2005).\nAn empty universe is thus not a viable cosmological model, but remains a useful reference model when\ncomparing predictions of various cosmological models.\nFig. 7 of Riess et al. shows the magnitude\u2013redshift diagram for SN Ia in a residual form: relative to an empty\nuniverse model. Being eternally coasting, this model\nhas a vanishing deceleration parameter, so it naturally\nseparates accelerating from decelerating models. Also,\nit is evident from Fig. 7 of Riess et al. that the model\nfits the data much better than an Einstein\u2013de Sitter\nuniverse (\u03a9m = 1, \u03a9\u039b = 0).\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nWe have derived the angular diameter distance DA\nand the luminosity distance DL in the Milne kinematic\ncosmological model, using only special-relativistic concepts. In the derivations, the central r\u00f4le was played\nby the special-relativistic Doppler formula for photons'\nredshift. We have found that DL = (1 + z)2 DA , in accordance with general relativity. The derived formulae\nare identical to these corresponding to an empty uni2 From supernovae alone. Combined with the constraint\nof a flat universe, strongly supported by the CMB observations, the data of Tonry et al. yielded \u03a9m = 0.28 \u00b1 0.05\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.72 \u00b1 0.05, implying a currently accelerating\nuniverse at much higher confidence.\n\nverse in the FRW cosmology. We have shown where\nDavis & Lineweaver failed to correctly derive the luminosity distance. Finally, we have presented the resulting magnitude\u2013redshift diagram for supernovae Ia.\nWhile the prediction of special relativity according to\nDavis & Lineweaver is far away from that for the currently favored cosmological model, the correct prediction of special relativity follows the favored model much\nmore closely. Though not a viable alternative to the\ncurrently favored model, the Milne model has great\npedagogical value, elucidating the kinematic aspect of\nthe universe's expansion. In the context of current research on supernovae Ia, it remains a useful reference\nmodel when comparing predictions of various cosmological models.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research has been supported in part by the Polish\nState Committee for Scientific Research grant No. 1\nP03D 012 26, allocated for the period 2004\u20132007.\n\nReferences\nChodorowski, M.
