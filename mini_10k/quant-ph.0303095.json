Franson\nJohns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723\n(Dated: August 23, 2018)\nWe report a proof-of-principle demonstration of a probabilistic controlled-NOT gate for single\nphotons. Single-photon control and target qubits were mixed with a single ancilla photon in a\ndevice constructed using only linear optical elements. The successful operation of the controlledNOT gate relied on post-selected three-photon interference effects which required the detection of\nthe photons in the output modes.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0303095v2 9 Jul 2003\n\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 42.50.Dv, 42.65.Lm\n\nThere has been considerable interest in a linear optics\napproach to quantum computing [1, 2], in which probabilistic two-qubit logic operations are implemented using\nlinear optical elements and measurements made on a set\nof n additional (ancilla) photons. Here we report a proofof-principle demonstration of a probabilistic controlledNOT (CNOT) gate using a single ancilla photon. Two\nof the required single-photons were produced using parametric down-conversion [3] while a third photon was obtained from an attenuated laser pulse. The use of only\none ancilla photon required that all three photons be detected, in which case the device was known to have correctly performed a CNOT logic operation.\nLogic operations are inherently nonlinear, so it is somewhat surprising that they can be performed using simple\nlinear optical elements [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The necessary nonlinearity is obtained by mixing the input photons with n ancilla photons using linear elements, and\nthen measuring the state of the ancilla photons after the\ninteraction. The measurement process is nonlinear [11],\nsince a single-photon detector either records a photon or\nnot, and it projects out the desired logical output state\nprovided that certain results are obtained from the measurements. The results of the operation are known to be\ncorrect whenever these specific measurement results are\nobtained, which occurs with a failure rate that scales as\n1\n1\nn [1] or n2 [2] in the limit of large n, depending on the\napproach that is used.\nIn a series of earlier experiments [12, 13], we demonstrated several elementary logic gates for single photons, including a quantum parity check and a destructive\nCNOT gate. The latter device produced only a single\noutput (the target qubit) and was equivalent to an exclusive OR gate, since the control qubit was destroyed.\nAs a result, destructive CNOT gates cannot be used for\nreversible computing or to demonstrate the generation of\nentanglement, for example. Here we describe the demonstration of a full CNOT gate whose output includes both\nthe target and control qubits. Although the gate is probabilistic and the presence of both output qubits must\neventually be verified by subsequent measurements (the\nso-called coincidence basis), the quantum features of both\noutputs can still be investigated. For example, the generation of entanglement can be demonstrated using Bell's\ninequalities and both outputs of such a gate can be fed\n\ninto subsequent logic gates, provided that one can eventually verify that both outputs were produced.\nWe have previously shown [6] that a CNOT gate can\nbe implemented using the simple beam splitter arrangement shown in Figure 1(a). Here the logical value of each\nof the qubits is represented by the polarization state of a\nsingle photon, where a horizontal polarization state |Hi\nrepresents a value of 0 and a vertical polarization state\n|V i represents a value of 1. In addition to the two input\nphotons, a pair of ancilla photons in an entangled state\n|\u03c6+ i = \u221a12 (|00i + |11i) are incident on two polarizing\nbeam splitters as shown. Polarization-sensitive detectors\nmeasure the state of the ancilla photons in an appropriate basis when they leave the beam splitters, and corrections to the output may be required based on the results\nof these measurements [13]. Provided that one and only\none photon is found in each of these detectors, the output\nof the device will correspond to that of a CNOT gate [6].\nThis corresponds to the case of n = 2 and the device succeeds in producing the correct output with a probability\nof 41 .\nThe basic operation of this controlled-NOT gate can be\nroughly understood as follows: The lower beam splitter\n\nsingle ancilla\nphoton\ncontrol\nphoton\n\ncontrol\nphoton\nPBS-1\n\nentangled ancilla\n(photon pair)\nPBS-2\n\ntarget\nphoton\n\n(a)\n\ntarget\nphoton\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: Two implementations of a CNOT gate using linear\noptics and ancilla photons. (a) Our previously proposed gate\n[6] which relies on two entangled ancilla photons. (b) The simplified implementation, which requires only one ancilla photon, and is the subject of this paper. PBS-1 and PBS-2 are\npolarizing beam splitters, with PBS-2 being rotated by 45\u25e6 .\n\n\f2\nperforms the logical function of a controlled-NOT gate\nexcept that one of its input qubits is destroyed in the\nlower detector (a destructive CNOT gate). The destruction of one of the input qubits can be avoided by first\ncopying (encoding) the value of that qubit onto two output qubits. One of the copies is then input into the destructive CNOT gate while the remaining copy serves as\none of the required logical outputs. A quantum encoder\nof that kind can be implemented using the upper beam\nsplitter and the entangled ancilla photons as described\nin Ref. [6]. The net result of these operations is a full\nCNOT gate with both of the input qubits preserved.\nFrom an experimental point of view, the main difficulty\nwith the CNOT gate of Figure 1(a) is its reliance on\nheralded entangled ancilla pairs [14, 15, 16], which have\nnot yet been reliably demonstrated. However, the need\nfor a pair of ancilla photons in an entangled state can\nbe avoided using the one-ancilla CNOT gate shown in\nFigure 1(b). This device is equivalent to that of Figure\n1(a) except that a single ancilla enters the upper beam\nsplitter where a detector was previously located. If the\nancilla photon is in an equal superposition of |0i and |1i,\nthen it can be shown that the value of the control photon\nwill be copied (encoded) into the two output ports of the\nupper beam splitter just as before. However, the price\nthat must be paid for using a single ancilla photon instead\nof an entangled ancilla pair is that the correct logical\noutput will only be produced if a single photon actually\nexits from each of the three output ports of the device.\nWithout reliable quantum non-demolition devices [17],\nthis condition can only be verified by eventually detecting\nthe output qubit photons as shown Figure 1(b). This\ntype of \"coincidence basis\" operation prohibits the use of\nthe device in a scalable approach to quantum computing,\nbut it does provide a convenient means of demonstrating\nthe operation of a CNOT logic gate for single photons\n[8].\nThe operation of the CNOT gate shown in Figure\n1(b) can be understood by considering an input state\nconsisting of the single ancilla photon in the required\nsuperposition state \u221a12 (|0A i + |1A i), and an arbitrary\ninitial two-photon state of the control and target photons, \u03b11 |0c 0t i + \u03b12 |0c 1t i + \u03b13 |1c 0t i + \u03b14 |1c 1t i, where\nP4\n2\ni=1 |\u03b1i | = 1. It can be shown that (under ideal experimental conditions) this initial state is transformed into\nan output state of the form:\n|\u03c8iout =\n1\n\u221a |0A i (\u03b11 |0c 0t i + \u03b12 |0c 1t i + \u03b13 |1c 1t i + \u03b14 |1c 0t i)\n2 2\n1\n+ \u221a |1A i (\u03b11 |0c 1t i + \u03b12 |0c 0t i + \u03b13 |1c 0t i + \u03b14 |1c 1t i)\n2 2\n\u221a\n3\n|\u03c8\u22a5 i\n(1)\n+\n2\nwhere |\u03c8\u22a5 i represents the normalized combination of amplitudes that are orthogonal to the \"coincidence basis\"\n\nmeasurement condition of one photon in each of the three\noutput modes.\nThe first term in equation (1) indicates that the detection of a single photon in the |0i state by DA projects the\noutput in the control and target modes into the desired\nCNOT transform [18] of the input. This occurs with a\nprobability of 81 , which reflects the probabilistic nature\nof the device. The second term in equation (1) shows\nthat the overall success probability could be increased to\n1\n4 by also accepting events in which DA registers a single\nphoton in the |1i state, provided that feed-forward control techniques [13] are used to bit-flip the output target\nstate.\nA simplified schematic of the experimental apparatus\nused to demonstrate the CNOT gate of Figure 1(b) is\nshown in Figure 2. Two of the three photons were produced using a pulsed laser beam passing through a nonlinear crystal (parametric down-conversion [3]), while the\nthird photon was obtained by attenuating the laser pulses\nthemselves to the point that each pulse had only a small\nprobability of containing a single photon. Since the frequency of the laser beam was doubled before the downconversion process, the down-converted photons had the\nsame frequency as the photons obtained directly from the\n\n\u03bbA\n\nA\n\nSPDC\npump\npulse\n\nx2\n\n\u03b8C\n\n(delay)\n\n\u03bbC\n\nDC\n\nC\nPBS-1\n\nqubit\nprep.\n\nqubit\nanalysis\n\nfpc\nPBS-2\n\nT\natten.\n\n\u03bbT\n\n\u03b8T\n\n(delay)\n\n\u03b8A\n\nDT\n\nDA\n\nFIG. 2: Experimental apparatus used to demonstrate the\nCNOT gate of Fig.1(b). Short laser pulses from a mode-locked\nTi:Sapphire laser (\u2248 150fs, 76MHz, 780nm) were frequency\ndoubled (x2) to provide UV pulses (390nm) that were used to\npump a 0.7mm thick BBO crystal (labelled SPDC) for parametric down-conversion. The down-converted photons were\ncoupled into the ancilla (A) and control qubit (C) single-mode\nfiber input ports of the upper polarizing beam splitter (PBS1). A small fraction of the original pumping pulse was picked\noff and used as the weak coherent state, which was coupled\ninto the target qubit (T) port of PBS-2. \u03bbA,C,T were halfwave plates used for ancilla and qubit state preparation, while\n\u03b8A,C,T were polarizers used for post-selection and qubit analysis. DA,C,T were single-photon detectors, which were preceded by 10nm bandpass filters at 780nm (not shown). fpc\nwas a calibrated fiber polarization controller used to rotate\nthe reference frame of PBS-2 by 45\u25e6 with respect to PBS-1.\n\n\f3\n\n.

Furthermore, the use of short laser pulses followed by narrow-band interference filters ensured that all\nthree photons were very nearly indistinguishable [19, 20].\nSingle-mode optical fibers were used to connect the\nbeam splitters and other components, which reduced the\npossibility of an error due to mode mismatch. Errors\ndue to changes in the state of polarization of the photons were minimized using standard optical-fiber polarization controllers. The required 45o rotation of PBS-2\nwas accomplished by using a calibrated fiber polarization\nrotator (fpc) between the two beam splitters, and rotating the definitions of |0i and |1i by 45o in the remaining\nports of PBS-2. The polarization states of the input photons could be varied by rotating half-wave plates placed\nbefore the beams entered the optical fibers, as shown in\nFigure 2. This allowed the logical inputs to the device to\nconsist of arbitrary superposition states.\nIn order for the three photons to be indistinguishable,\nit was also necessary for them to arrive at the appropriate beam splitters at the same time. The required\npath length adjustments were optimized by maximizing\nthe visibilities of various two-photon [21, 22] and threephoton interference effects [23, 24]. The visibilities of\nthese interference patterns were typically in the range of\n85 - 95% for two-photon interference effects [21, 22] at\nPBS-1, and 60 - 70% for three-photon (ie. gated twophoton) interference effects [23, 24] at PBS-2. The lower\nvalues for the three-photon interference effects were primarily due to the use of interference filters with a relatively wide bandwidth of 10 nm [19, 20], and a decreased\nsignal-noise-ratio as described in reference [24]. The use\nof smaller bandwidth filters would be expected to substantially increase the three-photon visibility [24], at the\ncost of lower counting rates.\nThe output of the device was measured using polarization analyzers followed by single-photon detectors, and\nevents were only accepted if all three detectors registered\na photon. In accordance with Equation (1), DA only\naccepted ancilla photons in the logical state |0i, which\nwas accomplished by fixing the orientation of \u03b8A at 0o\nin the computational basis (which was physically rotated\nby 45o due to the orientation of PBS-2). In this initial\ndemonstration, feed-forward control techniques [13] were\nnot used to accept events in which the ancilla photon\nwas found in the logical state |1i. Since the attenuated\nlaser pulses correspond to weak coherent states, it was\nnecessary to minimize the probability of there being two\nphotons in a given pulse by reducing the probability of a\nsingle photon to roughly 10\u22123 .\nUsing these techniques, it was possible to measure the\noutput of the device for all possible combinations of logical inputs (0 or 1) as well as superposition states. The\nresults of these measurements when the input qubits both\nhad specific values of 0 or 1 are summarized in Figure 3.\nThe correct results from an ideal CNOT gate [18] correspond to the four larger peaks, while the smaller peaks\ncorrespond to incorrect results. It can be seen that the\noutput of the device is clearly correct, aside from over-\n\n50\n\n11\n\n00\n10\n\n01\nInput\n\n01\n\n10\n11\n\nOutput\n\n00\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental results from the CNOT gate of Figure\n1(b).

For a given input\nstate, the distribution of errors among the three incorrect output states was primarily determined by the extent to which they depended on destructive three-photon\nquantum interference effects. In addition, minor changes\nin the polarization states of the photons in the optical\nfibers allowed small contributions from the output state\nassociated with the detection of an ancilla photon in the\nstate |1i.\n\nIt is important to demonstrate that quantum logic\ngates maintain the quantum-mechanical coherence of the\ninput qubits when the latter are in superposition states\nof 0 and 1. As an example of this coherence, Figure\n4 shows the results obtained when the incident control\nqubit was in the superposition state \u221a12 (|0i + |1i) while\nthe target was in the state |0i. In that case, the two output qubits should be produced in an entangled state of\nthe form \u221a12 (|00i + |11i), which is the state |\u03c6+ i. This\nis an important example, since a CNOT gate is expected\nto produce entanglement between two independent input\nphotons. The data in the figure corresponds to the number of three-fold coincidence counts as a function of the\ntarget analyzer, with the control analyzer set to the logical value 0. In that case, a detection of a control photon\ncollapses the entangled state to just the first term, so that\nthe target photon should also be found with logical value\n0. The data of Figure 4 are consistent with that prediction. When the analyzer in the path of the control photon was set to logical value 1 instead, then the entangled\nstate collapsed to the second term and the target photon\nwas found with logical value 1, as expected. Analogous\n\n\f4\nresults were found in a basis rotated by 45\u25e6 . Although\nthese results demonstrate entanglement between the two\nphotons and nonlocal measurement results, the data extracted from these plots was not sufficient to allow a violation of Bell's inequality using the two output photons\n[25].\n\n3-fold Coinc.

The data\nshows the number of three-fold coincidence counts per 1500\nseconds as a function of the target analyzer, with the control analyzer fixed at 0\u25e6 (qubit value |0i). The solid line is\na sinusoidal least squares fit to the data, with a visibility of\n(61.5\u00b17.4)%. The slight shift away from the expected target\nvalue of |0i (eg. \u03b8T = 45\u25e6 ) was primarily due to incompletely\ncompensated birefringences in the fibers.\n\nIn summary, we have experimentally demonstrated the\noperation of a probabilistic CNOT gate for single photons\nin the coincidence basis using linear optical elements and\na single ancilla photon. Although the presence of the\noutput qubits must eventually be verified, the properties\nof both the control and target qubits can be investigated\nbefore they are detected. Input qubits with specific values in the computational basis produced output states\nthat corresponded to those of a CNOT gate aside from\ntechnical errors on the order of 20%. Superpositions of\ninput states were found to produce entanglement of the\noutput qubits. Although the use of a single ancilla photon limits the performance of the current device, which\nis not scalable, larger numbers of ancilla photons can\nbe combined with more general linear optics techniques\n[1, 2] to reduce the probability of error and produce an\napproach that is scalable.\nThis work was supported by ARO, NSA, ARDA, ONR,\nand IR&D funding.\n\n[1] E.
