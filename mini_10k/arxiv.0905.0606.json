S YSTEM M ODEL\n\nBit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is an attractive\nscheme for wireless communications where a block of information bits is mapped to transmit symbols via a channel encoder and a symbol mapper separated by a code bit interleaver\n[1]. At the receiver side, a demodulator (demapper, detector)\ncalculates log-likelihood ratios (LLR) for the code bits, which\nare de-interleaved and passed to the channel decoder.\nTheoretically, one real-valued LLR per code bit needs to be\ncomputed and stored by the receiver. Clearly, practical digital\nimplementations can only use finite word-length approximations of real numbers, which motivates the study of LLR\nquantization. We note that LLR quantization is also relevant\nfor wireless (relay) networks that perform distributed turbo\nand network coding by exchanging soft information between\ndifferent nodes. Optimal LLR quantization maximizing information rate for the special case of BPSK modulation over an\nAWGN channel was considered in [2]. However, an extension\nof this approach to other channels and modulations appears\ninfeasible. Thus, we consider a different quantizer design\nin this paper which allows for simple implementation while\nonly slightly degrading information rate. More specifically, our\ncontributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose to quantize the LLRs such that the quantizer\noutputs become equiprobable and provide appropriate\nreliability information to the channel decoder.\n\u2022 We investigate the impact of the proposed LLR quantization on ergodic and outage rate, using a semi-analytical\napproach for single-input single-output (SISO) systems\nwith BPSK and Monte-Carlo simulations otherwise.\n\u2022 We develop a method for designing and implementing\nthe proposed quantizer during data transmission.\n\u2022 We provide bit error rate (BER) simulations for BICM\nsystems with LLR quantization using low-density paritycheck (LDPC) codes.\n\nWe consider a MIMO-BICM system with MT transmit\nantennas and MR receive antennas (SISO-BICM can be viewed\nas special case with MT = MR = 1). A block diagram is shown\nin Fig. 1. A sequence of information bits b[n\u2032 ] is encoded using\nan error-correcting code, passed through a bitwise interleaver\n\u03a0 and then scrambled by a pseudo-random sequence pl [n].\nThe uniformly distributed interleaved and scrambled code bits\nare demultiplexed into MT antenna streams (\"layers\"). In each\nlayer, groups of m code bits are mapped to (complex) data\nsymbols xk [n] \u2208 A, k = 1, . . . , MT ; here, A denotes the\nsymbol alphabet of size |A| = 2m . The transmit vector at\nsymbol time n is given by x[n] , (x1 [n] . . . xMT [n])T and\ncarries R0 = mMT interleaved code bits cl [n], l = 1, . . . , R0 .\nAssuming flat fading, the length-MR receive vector equals\ny[n] = H[n]x[n] + w[n].\n\n(1)\n\nHere, H[n] is the MR \u00d7MT MIMO channel matrix and w[n] \u223c\nCN (0, \u03c3 2 I) denotes the complex Gaussian noise vector. In the\nfollowing, we will omit the time index n to simplify notation.\nAt the receiver, the max-log demodulator calculates LLRs\nfor the code bits cl according to [3]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u039bl = 2 min0 ky\u2212Hxk2 \u2212 min1 ky\u2212Hxk2 .\n(2)\n\u03c3 x\u2208Xl\nx\u2208Xl\nHere, Xlb denotes the set of transmit vectors for which cl =\nb. These LLRs (or approximate/quantized versions thereof)\nare de-scrambled by the sequence p\u0304l [n] = 1 \u2212 2pl [n], deinterleaved and used by the channel decoder to obtain bit\nestimates b\u0302[n]. The symmetric noise distribution and the use\nof the scrambler yield the symmetries f\u039b (\u03be) = f\u039b (\u2212\u03be) and\nf\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 1) = f\u039b|c (\u2212\u03be|c = 0) for the (un)conditional LLR\ndistribution. Hence, knowledge of f\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 1) is sufficient\nfor characterizing \u039b.\n\n\f\u03a0\n\nMIMO\n\nDEMUX\n\nencoder\n\ncl[n]\n\npl [n]\n\ny[n]\n\nx[n]\nchannel\nmap.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nif \u039bl \u2208 Ik .\n\nHere, \u03bbk \u2208 Ik is the kth quantization level.\nIn the following, we consider the equivalent discrete channel with binary input c \u2208 {0, 1} and K-ary output d \u2208\n{\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbK }. Here, c and d are obtained by randomly picking\na bit position l = 1, . . . , R0 according to a uniform distribution. This models a situation where the outer channel code\nis \"blind\" to the bit positions within the symbol labels. The\ncrossover probabilities pbk = Pr{d = \u03bbk |c = b} = Pr{\u039b \u2208\nIk |c = b} of this channel are given by\nZ\nf\u039b|c (\u03be|b) d\u03be,\npbk =\nIk\n\nwhere f\u039b|c (\u03be|b) is the conditional probability density function\n(pdf) of the LLR \u039b given that c = b (averaged with respect\nto bit position l). Note that Pr{d = \u03bbk } = Pr{\u039b \u2208 Ik } =\n1\n2 (p0k + p1k ). The mutual information (capacity) I = I(c ; d)\nof this discrete channel is given by [4]\n1\n\nK\n\n(3)\n\nIf the LLR distribution f\u039b|c (\u03be|b) and hence the transition\nprobabilities pbk are averaged with respect to the statistics of\nthe physical channel H (reflecting fast fading), the quantity\nI describes the ergodic rate achievable over the equivalent\nchannel (cf. [5]). Otherwise (quasi-static fading), the transition\nprobabilities pbk , and thus the rate I, change with every\nrealization of the channel matrix H. Here, the probability\n0 \u2264 R \u2264 R0\n\ndl [n]\n\n\u03a0\u22121\n\ndecoder\n\nb\u0302[n\u2032 ]\n\nand no fading the solution is given in [2]). Hence, we propose\na different approach: since c \u2212 \u039b \u2212 d is a Markov chain, the\ndata processing inequality implies I(c ; d) \u2264 I(c ; \u039b). In order\nfor I(c ; d) to be as close as possible to I(c ; \u039b) (for fixed\nK), our proposed quantizer maximizes the mutual information\nI(\u039b; d). With H(*) denoting entropy, it follows that I(\u039b; d) =\nH(d) \u2212 H(d|\u039b) and H(d|\u039b) = 0 because d is a deterministic\nfunction of \u039b. H(d) is maximized by a uniform distribution of\nd and therefore, the quantizer boundaries i\u22c6k , k = 1, . . . , K\u22121,\nhave to ensure that\nPr{d = \u03bbk } =\n\n1\np0k + p1k\n= ,\n2\nK\n\nk = 1, . . . , K .\n\n(5)\n\nUsing the unconditional\nR \u03bb \u0002 cumulative LLR distribution F\u0003\u039b (\u03bb) =\nPr{\u039b \u2264 \u03bb} = 21 \u2212\u221e f\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 0) + f\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 1) d\u03be, the\noptimal boundaries can be obtained by finding the arguments\nfor which F\u039b (\u03bb) = k/K, i.e.,\n\u0010k\u0011\ni\u22c6k = F\u039b\u22121\nk = 1, . . . , K \u22121 .\n(6)\nK\n\nWe note that for the capacity in (3) only the bins (boundaries) are relevant, i.e., the actual quantization levels \u03bbk do\nnot influence the achievable rate. However, these values are\nimportant in order to provide the channel decoder (e.g., a belief\npropagation decoder) with correct reliability information [6].\nIn view of the equivalent discrete channel, we hence propose\nto choose the quantization levels as corresponding LLRs\n\u03bb\u22c6k = log\n\nPr{c = 1|d = \u03bbk }\np1k\n.\n= log\nPr{c = 0|d = \u03bbk }\np0k\n\n(7)\n\nWe finally note that \u03bb\u22c6k \u2208 Ik .\nIV.

LLR quantization with more than 2 bits is\nrequired to offer performance gains at medium-to-high outage\nprobability. At high SNR, the gap between the non-quantized\ncase and all quantized demodulators (q = 1, 2, 3) is 2.5 dB\nand 1.5 dB for R = 1/4 bpcu and R = 3/4 bpcu, respectively.\nHere, q > 3 is required to close this gap and to reach outage\nprobabilities close to the non-quantized case.\n\nUsing the eigenvalue decomposition A = U\u03a3UT , with\n\u221a U\n1\u00b1 1+\u03c32\northogonal and \u03a3 = diag{\u03c31 , \u03c32 }, where \u03c31,2 =\n,\n2\nwe further obtain\ni\n1\n1 h\n\u039b = 2 z\u0303T \u03a3 z\u0303 = 2 \u03c31 z\u030312 + \u03c32 z\u030322 .\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nT\nHere, z\u0303 = U z \u223c N (0, I) due to the orthogonality of U.\nThus, \u039b is a linear combination of two independent chi-square\nrandom variables with one degree of freedom.

(6)), and the ergodic capacity of the equivalent channel. Numerical results for the rate in bits per channel\nuse (bpcu) versus SNR achievable with our proposed LLR\nquantizers of different word-length q are shown in Fig. 2. As a\nreference, we also show the capacity of non-quantized max-log\ndemodulation (labeled 'no quant'). Hard-output demodulation\n(i.e., 1-bit quantization) incurs a significant performance loss\ncompared to non-quantized demodulation (more than 5 dB\nat rate 1/2 bpcu). With 2-bit and 3-bit LLR quantization,\nperformance remains within 1 dB of the non-quantized case up\nto rates of approximately 1/2 bpcu and 3/4 bpcu, respectively.\nB. Outage Capacity\nAdditionally conditioning on the channel coefficient h, it\nfollows straightforwardly that \u039b|c \u223c N (x \u03b3, 2\u03b3) with \u03b3 =\nh2 /\u03c3 2 . This allows to calculate the transition probabilities of\nthe equivalent channel as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nik \u2212 (2b\u22121)\u03b3\nik\u22121 \u2212 (2b\u22121)\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212Q\n.\npbk = Q\n2\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n\nV. MIMO S YSTEMS AND H IGHER -O RDER M ODULATION\nIn the following, we investigate LLR quantization for\nMIMO systems and higher-order constellations. Since in this\ncase analytical expressions for the LLR distribution are hard\nto obtain in general, the remaining discussion is based exclusively on numerical results. For the capacity results in this\nsection, we used empirical LLR distributions obtained from\nMonte-Carlo simulations to determine the bins Ik such that\nPr{\u039b \u2208 Ik } = 1/K (cf. (5)). In the remainder of the paper,\nwe will consider a 2\u00d72 MIMO system with Gray-labeled 16QAM modulation (here, R0 = 8 bpcu).\nA. Ergodic Capacity\nWe evaluated the capacity in (3) under the assumption\nof ergodic spatio-temporally i.i.d. fast Rayleigh fading for\nvarious quantizer word-lengths q. To this end, we estimated\nthe transition probabilities pbk by means of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations after having determined the optimal bins based on\n105 channel realizations. Fig. 4 shows the results obtained. It\ncan be seen that the extreme case of 1-bit quantization yields\na considerable performance loss in comparison to the nonquantized case (e.g., 3 dB SNR loss at 4 bpcu). Increasing the\nnumber of quantization levels reduces this gap significantly (to\n0.5 dB and 0.1 dB for 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, respectively,\nat 4 bpcu). Even though at higher rates slightly increasing\nSNR gaps are observed, these results suggest that 3-bit LLR\nquantization is sufficient for practical purposes.\nIn order to illustrate the impact of the LLR quantizer design\non ergodic capacity, we consider the same 2\u00d72 MIMO-BICM\n\n\f7\n6\n\nOutage Probability\n\nMax.

Fig. 5 plots\nthe SNR required to achieve target rates of 2 bpcu, 4 bpcu\nand 8 bpcu versus i3 , respectively. As a reference we also\nshow the required SNR using a 2-bit quantizer with uniform\ndistribution and the required SNR for 1-bit quantization (hard\ndemodulation). It can be seen that for rates of 2 bpcu and\n4 bpcu the 2-bit quantizer with uniform distribution requires\nthe same SNR as the 2-bit quantizer with optimal choice of\ni3 (this is the quantizer proposed in [2]). For rates of 6 bpcu\nthe SNR loss of the 2-bit quantizer with uniform distribution\nis about 1 dB compared to the optimal quantizer.\nB. Outage Capacity\nWe next provide numerical results for the outage probability in (4) for quasi-static fading. Fig. 6 shows the outage\nprobability pout (r) versus SNR for different quantizer wordlengths and R = 2 bpcu and R = 6 bpcu. From the asymptotic\nslopes of these curves it is seen that the diversity order\nequals 2 in all cases. For R = 2 bpcu and R = 6 bpcu, hard\ndemodulation (q = 1) is respectively 4.8 dB and 1.8 dB away\nfrom the non-quantized case at high SNR. LLR quantization\nwith 2 and 3 bits performs only slightly better at very low\n\nVI. E STIMATION OF Q UANTIZATION PARAMETERS\nThe computation of the quantization boundaries i\u22c6k and\nquantization levels \u03bb\u22c6k according to (6) and (7), respectively,\nrequires the LLR distributions f\u039b (\u03be) and f\u039b|c (\u03be|c), which in\ngeneral are unknown. We thus address on-the-fly estimation of\nthe quantization parameters. The boundaries can be estimated\nby using an empirical estimate of the unconditional LLR\ndistribution F\u039b (\u03be), which can be obtained from a reasonable\nnumber of non-quantized LLRs.\nIn contrast, determining the quantization levels \u03bb\u22c6k by\nestimating f\u039b|c (\u03be|c) is more difficult since the code bits\nare unknown at the receiver. Hence, we propose to use the\nfollowing simple parametric model, which is motivated by\nnumerical results for the 2\u00d72 case with 16-QAM (other system\nparameters may require a different model):\n(\n\u03b1\u03b2\nexp(\u03b1\u03be)\n\u03be < 0,\nf\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 1) = \u03b1+\u03b2\n(10)\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03be) \u03be \u2265 0.\nTo estimate the two parameters \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0, we choose\ntwo bins \u012a1 and \u012a2 and use the non-quantized LLRs \u039b to\nobtain empirical estimates P\u0302i , i = 1, 2, of the probabilities\nZ\nf\u039b (\u03be) d\u03be ,\nPi (\u03b1, \u03b2) = Pr{\u039b \u2208 \u012ai } =\n\u012ai\n\u0002\n\u0003\nwith f\u039b (\u03be) = f\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 0) + f\u039b|c (\u03be|c = 1) /2. The system\nof equations Pi (\u03b1, \u03b2) = P\u0302i can then be solved numerically\nto obtain estimates of \u03b1 and \u03b2. The transition probabilities\nof the equivalent channel and the quantization levels are then\ncomputed based on (10) using the estimates of \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nVII. N UMERICAL BER R ESULTS\nTo verify the capacity results, we performed BER simulations for SISO- and MIMO-BICM systems in ergodic Rayleigh\nfast fading.

BER performance for a rate-1/2 LDPC coded 2\u00d72 MIMO system\nwith Gray-labeled 16-QAM and different LLR quantization word-lengths.\n\nA. SISO-BICM\nWe first consider a BPSK-modulated SISO-BICM system\nwith LLR quantizers designed using the analytical results\nfrom Section IV. Fig. 7 shows the BER for our proposed\nLLR quantizers with different word-length together with the\ntheoretical SNR thresholds (obtained from Fig. 2). All BER\ncurves are reasonably close to the respective SNR thresholds\n(obtained from Fig. 2 and indicated by vertical lines). The gaps\nof 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit LLR quantization to the non-quantized\ncase respectively equal 6.2 dB, 1.1 dB, and 0.4 dB.\nB. MIMO-BICM\nFig. 8 shows two (strongly overlapping) sets of BER curves\nfor the 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO-BICM system with Gray-labeled 16QAM and different LLR quantization word-lengths. One set of\ncurves (labeled 'offl.') pertains to an offline design of the LLR\nquantizer, whereas the other set (labeled 'onl.') estimates the\nquantization parameters on-the-fly according to Section VI.\nThe gap to the theoretical SNR thresholds (obtained from\nFig. 4 and indicated by vertical lines) equals 0.6 dB for 3-bit\nand 2-bit quantization and 1 dB for 1-bit quantization (hard\ndemodulation). Furthermore, the proposed on-the-fly estimator\nfor the LLR quantizer parameters performs extremely well in\nthis setup (virtually indistinguishable from the offline design).\nTo illustrate the importance of the correct choice of the LLR\nquantization levels, Fig. 9 shows BER versus quantization\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nQuantization Level \u03bb2=\u2212\u03bb1\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nFig. 9. BER versus quantization level for 1-bit quantization at an SNR of\n12.8 dB using a rate-1/2 LDPC code (2\u00d72 MIMO, 16-QAM, Gray labeling).\n\nlevel \u03bb2 = \u2212\u03bb1 for the same MIMO system as before with 1bit LLR quantization at an SNR of 12.8 dB. Here, the optimal\nquantizer level \u03bb\u22c62 = 2.26 (indicated by a dashed vertical line)\nachieves a BER of 4.5 * 10\u22124. It is seen that the BER achieved\nby the belief propagation decoder is quite sensitive to the\nchoice of \u03bb2 ; for \u03bb2 \u2264 1.5 or \u03bb2 \u2265 4.3, BER has deteriorated\nto about 10\u22121 (i.e., by more than 2 orders of magnitude).\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\nWe considered bit-interleaved coded modulation systems\nwith demodulators providing quantized log-likelihood ratios\n(LLR). We provided design rules which lead to easily implementable LLR quantizers and studied the information rates\nof the equivalent discrete channel in the ergodic and outage\nregime. Numerical results for capacity and bit error rate\nshowed that LLR quantization using a small number of bits\nis often sufficient. We also proposed simple procedures to\nestimate the quantizer parameters during data transmission.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to Jossy Sayir for drawing their\nattention to the problem of quantized soft information and to\nJoakim Jald\u00e9n for helpful comments.
