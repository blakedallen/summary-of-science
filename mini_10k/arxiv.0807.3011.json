Such systems exhibit rate independent\ndissipation and are widely used to model hysteretic phenomena and intermittency associated with magnetism,\nsuperconductivity, porous flow, fracture, friction, plasticity and martensitic phase transitions [2]. It has been\nrealized that in most cases scaling emerges as an interplay between quenched disorder, extremal dynamics, and\nquasi-static driving [24]. Within this general framework\nthe theoretical work has been mostly focussed on two\ntypes of models. In models of the Random Field Ising\n(RFIM) type, the critical behavior requires fine tuning\nof the amount of disorder r and the intermittent events\n(avalanches) are scale-free only at a certain r = ro [1].\nAn alternative approach links criticality to a pinningdepinning (PD) transition where the disorder r is an irrelevant parameter [3]. It has been established that criticality in the first class of models is classical, as in second\norder phase transitions [1], while in the second class it is\nself tuning in the sense that infinitely slow driving brings\nthe system automatically on a critical manifold [4, 5, 6].\nThe two approaches are fundamentally different. The\nfirst model describes regimes with dominating nucleation,\nwhile the second one deals exclusively with propagation.\nIt is then not surprising that the resulting criticality is\ndifferent. In the RFIM the emerging scaling has been\nexplained by the existence of a classical critical point\nof the order-disorder (OD) type. On the contrary, in\nPD theory one encounters a range of universality classes\nnone of which can be formally reduced to OD. A relation between the two types of critical phenomena has\nbeen, however, anticipated. Previous work has shown\nthat the presence of a nonlocal demagnetizing field of\nantiferromagnetic nature (as in soft magnets) can self\ntune the RFIM to display front-propagation critical exponents [7, 8]. In the PD framework similar 'self-tuning',\noften interpreted as self organized criticality (SOC), is\n\nobtained if the system is driven through a 'weak spring'\nwhich provides an explicit feedback mechanism [9]. In\nthis letter we use these insights to develop the first unifying model which displays a crossover between the OD\nand quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (QEW) universality\nclasses. We show that such crossover can be achieved\nexperimentally by modifying the properties of the external driving. Since the QEW model is equivalent to the\nOslo rice pile model [12] and is therefore paradigmatic for\nSOC, we are essentially dealing here with a fundamental\nrelation between OD and SOC.\nWe base our model on the observation that solids can\nbe deformed either by applying a force (soft device), or by\ncontrolling surface displacements (hard device) [13, 14].\nBoth driving mechanisms, soft and hard, can be handled\nsimultaneously if the system has a finite 'elasticity'. To\nintroduce this effect in a spin setting, consider a prototypical model which we call RSSM (Random Soft-Spin\n[15] or Snap-Spring [16, 17] Model). The main difference between the RSSM and its predecessor RFIM is\nthe finite curvature of the energy wells and the presence of elastic barriers. While the role of the softness\nof the spins is known to be secondary in equilibrium and\nin the case of soft driving, where it can be accounted\nfor through an appropriate 'dressing' of the underlying\nhard-spin model [15], the curvature of the wells becomes\ncrucial in the case with hard driving where it plays the\nrole of a regularization of the otherwise degenerate problem [14]. Consider a set of N bi-stable units located on\nthe nodes i = 1, 2, . . . N of a cubic lattice with linear size\nL = N 1/3 . The state of each snap-spring is characterized\nby a continuous scalar order parameter ei measuring the\nlocal 'strain'.

In each\nwell (one defined for ei < 0 and the other for ei > 0) we\nuse the approximation fi (ei ) = 21 (ei \u2212 si )2 \u2212 h\u2032i ei , where\nsi = \u00b11 is a spin variable and {h\u2032i } are random numbers\nrepresenting quenched disorder. The system is loaded\nthrough an 'elastic'Pdevice with the energy \u03c6d = 2c (e\u2212\u0113)2 ,\nwhere \u0113 = (1/N ) i ei is the average strain of the system of snap-springs, c is the stiffness of the loading\ndevice and e is the control parameter (global 'strain').\nOne obtains a hard device in the limit c \u2192 \u221e, and a\nsoft device in the limit c \u2192 0, e \u2192 \u221e with the stress\n\u03c3 = ce fixed; the system will be driven quasi-statically\nby changing the control parameter e, if c is finite, and\n\u03c3, if c = 0. We neglect thermal fluctuations (T = 0)\nand assume that the harmonic variables ei relax 'instantaneously' and can be adiabatically eliminated. By minimizing the\nenergy \u03c6+\u03c6d with respect to ei we obtain\nPtotal\nN\nei = \u1ebd + j=1 (Jij \u2212 k/N ) sj + hi where J = (1 + K)\u22121\nis the effective interaction between the spin variables si .\nWe impose\nP periodic boundary conditions, meaning that\nk\u221e = j Jij does not depend on i, and use the notations\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u1ebd = e[ck\nP \u221e (ck\u2032\u221e + 1) ], k = k\u221e [ck\u221e (1 + ck\u221e ) ], and\nhi = j Jij hj .\nBecause of the absence of thermal fluctuations and to\nthe separation of time scales between overdamped relaxation and driving, the system remains on a metastable\nbranch {ei ({sk }; e)} corresponding to a particular local\nminimum of the total energy until the latter ceases to\nbe stable [17]. When the instability condition si ei < 0\nis reached for some i the system jumps (through an\navalanche) to another locally stable branch characterized by a different spin configuration {s\u2032i }. We increase\ne by driving the system from an initial stable configuration with {si = \u22121} and assume that avalanches propagate (at constant e) with synchronous dynamics. For\nsimplicity, we consider only nearest-neighbor interactions\nwith Jii = J0 , Jij = J1 , and we set J0 = J1 = 1 so\nthat k\u221e = 7. The renormalized disorder variables {hi }\nare drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean\nand standard deviation r. Under these assumptions, the\nRSSM becomes formally equivalent to a nonlocal augmentation of the classical RFIM with demagnetizing factor k [1, 6, 7, 8, 18].\nAt k = 0 we expectedly observe an OD transition\nat ro \u2243 2.2 which separates a 'popping' (POP) regime\n(r > ro ) where all the avalanches are small from a 'snapping' (SNAP) regime (r < ro ) where an infinite avalanche\nsweeps most of the system\nP [1, 19]. The stress-strain curve\n\u22121\n\u03c3(e) = k\u221e\n(\u1ebd \u2212 kN \u22121 i si ) is continuous in the POP\nregime and displays a macroscopic discontinuity of the\nstrain in the SNAP regime [see Fig. 1]. The strain discontinuity associated with the nucleation of the infinite\navalanche occurs at a 'nucleation' stress \u03c3n which decreases with r as indicated in Fig. 2.\nFor non-zero k, the POP regime remains essentially\nunaltered. In contrast, stiffness has a non-trivial effect\n\n0.6\n\n(ro,\u03c3o)\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nr\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFIG. 2: Dependence on disorder of the averaged nucleation\nand propagation thresholds: h\u03c3n i (squares), h\u03c3p i at k = k\u221e\n(circles), and h\u03c3pd i for an interface [100] (triangles).

Darker and lighter colors indicate transformed regions (s = +1) and untransformed regions\n(s = \u22121).\n\nover the SNAP regime observed at low disorders. In\nthis case, a compact domain reminiscent of the infinite\navalanche (as in the k = 0 case) nucleates at the stress\n\u03c3n . The stress relaxes during the avalanche growth to\nsatisfy the global driving constraint. When k is below\na certain threshold kp (r), the SNAP behavior remains\nqualitatively as in the k = 0 case because the nonlocal\nconstraint is still soft. In contrast, when k > kp (r), the\nfirst stress drop prevents the spanning avalanche from\ngrowing [Fig. 1]. The transformation induced by the subsequent increase of e proceeds through the intermittent\ngrowth of the previously nucleated domain with untransformed system acting as a disordered background. The\npropagation is accompanied by stress oscillations around\nthe propagation threshold \u03c3p which remains stable during the whole yielding process. The average of \u03c3p over\ndisorder coincides with the depinning stress \u03c3pd for a\nflat [100] interface artificially introduced and driven as\nin Refs. [20, 21]. This is a clear evidence that systems\nwith k > kp (r) reach a front-propagation regime which\nself-tunes exactly around the PD point.

According to previous studies\n[21, 22], the faceted morphology is unstable giving rise\nto self-affine morphology in the thermodynamic limit for\nany finite r. Given the self-affine character of the boundary of the nucleated domain in the case of intermediate\ndisorders and the short-range character of the involved\ninteractions, one expects to observe critical scaling of the\nQEW (quenched Edwards-Wilkinson) universality class\n[3].\nWe check the validity of this assumption by analyzing the scaling properties of the number of spanning\navalanches Ns (k, r, L) and the distribution D(S; k, r, L)\nof avalanche sizes S. Following the arguments given in\nRefs. [19], we consider contributions to Ns of avalanches\nspanning along 1 or 2 dimensions only. Table I summarizes the action of the Renormalization Group (RG)\ntransformation on the parameters of the system and the\nresulting scaling hypotheses. The scaling variables measuring the distance to the OD critical point are u = r\u2212ro\nand k. The distance to the QEW critical manifold is\nw = k \u2212 kp (r).\nScaling collapse for Ns (k, r, L) close to the line kp (r),\nshown in Fig. 3(a), confirms the validity of our scaling\nhypothesis. We have checked that QEW scaling persists\nover a finite interval of disorders r < ro .

The value\nof \u03b8o which, in contrast to \u03b8q is positive, agrees with previous estimates for the RFIM [19]. Fig. 3(c) presents the\nscaling collapse of D(S; k, r, L) for r = 1.5 corresponding\nto a particular section of the function D\u0303(SL\u2212dq , wL\u03c1q )\nat constant wL\u03c1q . The resulting exponents dq and \u03c4q\nlisted in Table I do not depend on the selected section\nand are in agreement with previous estimates from frontpropagation models [4, 7, 21]. This confirms once again\nthat the propagation regime is of the QEW class; the\nanalysis of statistics of durations, omitted here, also supports this interpretation. The value of dq , giving the dimension of the avalanches in the propagation regime, is\nconsistent with d \u2212 1, which confirms the self-affine morphology of the propagating domain boundary [21]. The\ndistribution D(S; k, r, L) at r = r0 scales with exponents\npreviously reported for the OD universality class when k\nis very small. The exponent \u03c4o displays a considerable\ncrossover to QEW when the stiffness becomes relatively\nlarge. For instance, Fig. 3(d) shows that the scaling of\nD(S; k, r, L) at kL\u03c1o = 400 is better with exponent \u03c4q\nthan with \u03c4o .\nIn Fig. 4(a) we present the phase diagram in the (r, k)\nplane showing stable SNAP and POP regimes separated\nby the QEW line w = 0. This line describes QEW behavior and it ends in a point corresponding to the OD\nregime. The variety of observed non-equilibrium steady\nstates can be explained if one assumes the existence of\nfour fixed points for the RG flow, schematically depicted\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Scaling of the relevant quantities under a RG transformation with blocking parameter b and values of the associated\ncritical exponents (close to OD (subindex 'o') and to QEW (subindex 'q')).\nOD\nRG\nexponents\nSystem size, L L(b) = b\u22121 L\nStiffness, k\nk(b) = b\u03c1o k\n\u03c1o = 1.3 \u00b1 0.3\nDisorder, r\nu(b) = b1/\u03bdo u\n\u03bdo = 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 ([19])\nSize, S\nS(b) = b\u2212do S\ndo = 2.78 \u00b1 0.05 ([19])\nNs (k, r, L)\nNs (b) = b\u2212\u03b8o Ns\n\u03b8o = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 ([19])\nD(S; k, r, L)\nD(b) = b\u03c4o do D\n\u03c4o = 1.6 \u00b1 0.06 ([1])\nNs (k, r, L)\nL\u03b8o N\u0302s (kL\u03c1o , ku\u2212\u03c1o \u03bdo )\nD(S; k, r, L)\nL\u2212do \u03c4o D\u0302(SL\u2212do , kL\u03c1o , ku\u2212\u03c1o \u03bdo )\n\nin Fig. 4(b). The OD regime is associated with a fully repulsive critical point which can be reached only by tuning\nall four parameters: \u03c3 = \u03c3c , r = ro , k = 0, and L\u22121 = 0.\nIn contrast, QEW is a saddle point with a stable manifold which governs the large scale behavior of the systems\nwith r < ro , \u03c3 = \u03c3pd (r), k = kp (r), and L\u22121 = 0. As we\nhave seen the condition \u03c3 = \u03c3pd (r) is reached automatically during the self-organized propagation regime with\nk \u2265 kp (r); the corresponding systems lay on the critical manifold connecting OD and QEW points. The large\nscale behavior for systems located away from the critical manifold is governed either by SNAP (arrow 2) or by\nPOP (arrow 3) fixed points which are trivial attractors\nin the RG sense. While the self-organized propagation\nregime is strictly critical only for k = kp (r), our numerical simulations show that the system exhibits truncated\npower law scaling with QEW exponents in a broad range\nof parameters around the line kp (r) (arrows 4 and 4\u2032 in\nFig. 4(b)). This observation suggests that SOC can be\nviewed as an intermediate asymptotics. In general, since\nin real systems stiffness is finite and disorder is generic,\nwe anticipate the power law structure of critical fluctuations to be in most cases of the PD rather than of the\nOD type.\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with M.L.
