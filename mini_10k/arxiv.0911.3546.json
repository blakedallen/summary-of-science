Warwick\nX-ray & Observational Astronomy Group, Dept. of Physics & Astronomy, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, U.K.\n\n3 November 2018\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present a study, based on archival XMM-Newton observations, of the extended Xray emission associated with the inner disk of M33. After the exclusion of point sources\nwith LX > 2 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 (0.3-6 keV), we investigate both the morphology and spectrum\nof the residual X-ray emission, comprising the integrated signal from unresolved discrete\nsources and diffuse components. This residual emission has a soft X-ray spectrum which\ncan be fitted with a two-temperature thermal model, with kT \u2248 0.2 keV and \u2248 0.6 keV,\nthe cooler component accounting for the bulk of the luminosity. There is evidence that the\nX-ray emitting plasma has a subsolar metal abundance. The soft X-ray surface brightness\ndistribution shows a strong correlation with FUV emission and since the latter serves as a\ntracer of the inner spiral arms of M33, this is indicative of a close connection between recent\nstar-formation activity and the production of soft X-rays. Within 3.5 kpc of the nucleus of\nM33, the soft X-ray and FUV surface brightness distributions exhibit similar radial profiles.\nThe implication is that the ratio of the soft X-ray luminosity (0.3-2.0 keV) per unit disk area\nto the star formation rate (SFR) per unit disk area remains fairly constant within this inner\ndisk region. We derive a value for this ratio of 1 \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 , which\nis towards the top of the range of similar estimates for several other nearby face-on spiral\ngalaxies (e.g. M51, M83). In the same region, the ratio of soft X-ray luminosity to stellar mass\n(the latter derived from K-band photometry) is 4\u00d71028 erg s\u22121 M\u2299 \u22121 , a factor of 5-10 higher\nthan is typical of dwarf elliptical galaxies (e.g. M32, NGC3379), suggesting that 10-20% of\nthe unresolved emission seen in M33 may originate in its old stellar population. The remainder\nof the soft X-ray emission is found to be equally split between two spatial components, one\nwhich closely traces the spiral arms of the galaxy and the other more smoothly distributed\nacross the inner disk of M33. The former must represent a highly clumped low-filling factor\ncomponent linked to sites of recent or ongoing star formation, encompassing HII regions, Xray source complexes and X-ray superbubbles, whereas the distribution of the latter gives few\nclues as to its exact origin.\nKey words:\nGalaxies: ISM \u2013 galaxies: spiral \u2013 X-rays: galaxies\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOn the basis of current observations, the X-ray emission of spiral\ngalaxies may be separated into several components. A very significant contribution generally arises from a set of resolved point\nsources which correspond to the most luminous examples of the\ngalactic X-ray binary population, encompassing both high-mass\n(HMXB) and low-mass (LMXB) systems. To this must be added\nthe integrated emission from large numbers of lower-luminosity\nsources, including supernova remnants (SNRs), more quiescent\nforms of X-ray binary, cataclysmic variables, and coronally active\nstars. Finally we need to include the thermal X-ray signal emanating from concentrations of truly diffuse million-K gas resident\nboth in the galactic disk and potentially extending into the galactic\n\nhalo. The extent to which these components can be distinguished\nfrom each other depends on the orientation and distance of the target galaxy and, of course, on the spatial resolution and threshold\nsensitivity afforded by the observation.\nEarly X-ray studies based on Einstein observations focussed\non the brightest point sources seen in a number of nearby galaxies, whilst also finding underlying extended emission in complex\nstructures (Fabbiano 1989). The superior spatial resolution and soft\nresponse of Rosat further progressed the field, for example allowing the extent of the apparently diffuse emission to be traced both\nin and out of the plane of the disk for face-on and edge-on systems\nrespectively (e.g. Read et al. 1997; Dahlem et al 1998). More recent investigations, which exploit the enhanced collecting area, spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity of XMM-Newton and Chan-\n\n\f2\n\nR.A.Owen & R.S. Warwick\n\ndra, have probed the point-source populations in galaxies to much\nfainter thresholds than previously attainable (e.g. Strickland et al.\n2004a; Colbert et al. 2004). The X-ray luminosity functions (XLF)\ntypical of the HMXB and LMXB populations seen in spiral galaxies have thereby been determined (Grimm et al. 2005; Kilgard et al.\n2005; Fabbiano 2006). By extrapolation of the XLF to fluxes below\nthe threshold at which individual sources can be resolved, the total\naggregated luminosity of a particular class of source may also be\ninferred (Sazonov et al. 2006)\nIn two previous papers (Warwick et al. 2007, hereafter W07;\nOwen & Warwick 2009, hereafter OW09), we studied the morphology of the underlying unresolved soft X-ray emission in a sample\nof six nearby face-on spiral galaxies and made a comparison with\nother wavelength, particularly FUV, measurements. These studies\nconfirmed the close connection between recent star-formation and\nthe production of soft X-rays. We also investigated how the soft\nX-ray luminosity to star-formation rate (SFR) ratio varied radially\nwithin the individual galaxies as well as from galaxy to galaxy, and\nfound some evidence for an enhanced efficiency in the production\nof soft X-rays in regions of high SFR density. The link between\nsoft X-rays and star formation can be further explored by studying\ngalaxies closer to us, in which the majority of HMXBs and LMXBs\ncan be readily resolved, so as to provide a relatively clear perspective of the underlying soft X-ray emission. It is in this context that\nwe focus in the present paper on M33.\nM33 is an Sc spiral galaxy with an inclination of\n56\u25e6 (Zaritsky, Elston & Hill 1989) at a distance of 795 kpc\n(van den Burgh 1991). As the the third largest galaxy in the Local Group, the relative proximity of M33 permits detailed study\nof its discrete X-ray source population and enables the separation of these sources from any residual emission in the disk to a\nrelatively faint threshold. The relatively low Galactic foreground\nNH (7.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ; Kalberla et al. 2005) in the direction of\nM33, the low to moderate inclination of the galaxy, and its relatively high SFR in comparison to other nearby systems (0.30.7 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , Hippelein et al. 2003) make M33 an ideal candidate\nfor the present study.\nEarly Einstein observations of M33 revealed a total of 17\npoint sources, including the bright ULX M33 X-8 (Long et al.\n1981; Markert & Rallis 1983; Trinchieri, Fabbiano & Peres 1988).\nTrinchieri, Fabbiano & Peres (1988) also found evidence for the\npresence of a soft diffuse component in the plane of the galactic\ndisk. ROSAT observations (Schulman & Bregman 1995; Long et al.\n1996) expanded the known population of X-ray point sources in the\ndirection of M33 to a total of 184 (Haberl & Pietsch 2001). More\nrecently, using XMM-Newton data, a total of 350-400 X-ray point\nsources to a limiting X-ray luminosity of 1035 erg s\u22121 have been\nidentified and categorized (Foschini et al. 2004; Pietsch et al. 2004;\nGrimm et al. 2005; Misanovic et al. 2006; Grimm et al. 2005).\nThese results have been complemented by recent studies of M33\nusing Chandra (Plucinsky et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2008) which\nhave increased the source statistics particularly in the confused inner regions of the galaxy. Most of the emphasis to date has been\non the X-ray emission from point sources, but Haberl & Pietsch\n(2001), Pietsch et al. (2004) and T\u00fcllman et al. (2008) have noted\nthe presence of seemingly diffuse structures along the spiral arms.\nIt is this latter component which we examine in this paper.\nHere, we focus on the spectral and spatial properties of the\nunresolved X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33, deduced\nfrom archival XMM-Newton observations. In \u00a72, we describe the\nset of observations used to construct soft-band X-ray images and\noutline the methods used in the subsequent data analysis. In \u00a73, we\n\nbriefly examine the properties of the resolved discrete point source\npopulation and the spatial distribution of the residual soft X-ray\nemission, which remains after the contribution of these sources is\nexcluded. We go on to compare the soft X-ray morphology with\nGALEX FUV measurements and 2MASS K band data. We follow\nthis with spectral analysis of the bright point source population and\nunresolved residual emission (\u00a74). We examine the spatial extent\nof the X-ray emission in comparison with star formation data and\nthe underlying mass distribution (\u00a75) for M33, and compare these\nrelationships to those found in other galaxies. Finally we discuss\nthe implication of our results (\u00a76) and summarize our conclusions\n(\u00a77).\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nIn two previous papers (W07, OW09) we reported the results of an\nXMM-Newton study of six nearby face-on galaxies, namely M101,\nM83, M51, M74, NGC300 and NGC3184. Here we use similar\nmethods to incorporate M33 into our sample. Since the 2.5 diameter of M33 is 70\u2032 , which is more than a factor two larger than\nthe 30\u2032 field of view of the European Photon Imaging Camera\n(EPIC) instrument on XMM-Newton, multiple-pointings are needed\nto give good coverage of the inner disk of M33. The survey conducted by Pietsch et al. (2004) matches this requirement and in the\npresent work we have accessed the revelant datasets via the XMMNewton public archive. Details of the observations which comprise\nthe M33 survey are summarised in Table 1.\nData reduction was based on SAS v8.0. The datasets were\nscreened for periods of high background through the creation of\nfull-field 10\u201315 keV lightcurves. MOS data were excluded when\nthe 10\u201315 keV count-rate in a 100 s bin exceeded 0.2 ct s\u22121 ,\nwhereas pn data were excluded when the count rate in the same\nwaveband exceeded 2 ct s\u22121 . The resulting exposure times after\nfiltering the observations, as reported in Table 1, range from 1.5 to\n13 ks in the pn camera, with typically somewhat greater exposure\nin the individual MOS cameras. Several of the pn datasets which\ninclude the bright ULX near the nucleus of M33 are affected by\nOut Of Time (OoT) events. The SAS task epchain was used to\ncreate \"OoT event lists\", which simulate the spatial distribution of\nOoT events in the observations. From these event lists, images of\nthe distribution of OoT events were produced. These images were\nsubtracted from the raw images produced from the original event\nlists to produce images cleaned of OoT events, which could then\nbe used for imaging analysis. Additionally, the target observations\nwere examined to look for evidence of solar wind charge exchange\n(SWCX) emission, using the methods detailed in Carter & Sembay\n(2008). One observation was found to be highly contaminated (obsid:0141980201) and was thus excluded from the dataset.\nIn OW09 it was shown how an appropriate spatial mask could\nbe used to excise the bright source population from the residual\nemission, thereby greatly reducing the \"contamination\" due to the\nformer. Here we employ a slightly modified version of this image\nprocessing technique, necessitated by the need to mosaic the data\nsets from the M33 survey observations.\n2.1 Image Construction\nThe methods we have employed to produce the X-ray images of\nM33 mirror the procedures described in OW09. For consistency,\nwe use the same soft, medium and hard energy bands (0.3\u20131 keV,\n1\u20132 keV and 2\u20136 keV respectively), although in the present paper\n\n\fSoft X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

Images and exposure maps were extracted for all\nthree bands and cameras for each observation. A constant particle\nrate, estimated from the corners of the detector not exposed to the\nsky, was subtracted from each image and the set of images for a\ngiven bandpass were co-added using the method detailed in OW09,\nwith a position offset dependent on the pointing direction of the\nobservation. As the majority of observations were conducted using\nthe medium filter, factors were derived to convert observations with\nthe thin and thick filters to the same relative intensity scale. The exposure maps were likewise mosaiced to produce a single exposure\nmap for the extended field. Finally, flat-fielding was achieved by dividing the mosaiced image for each band by the relevant exposure\nmap.\nAt this stage it proved necessary to apply an iterative adjustment to the particle background estimates, so as to create a visually flat image. This was achieved by imposing a mask on the flatfielded images consisting of a point-source mask (see \u00a72.2) coupled with an elliptical mask extending to a major axis radius of\n15\u2032 from the nucleus of the galaxy. The ellipticity of the latter was\nfixed at the major/minor axis ratio reported in the RC3 catalogue\n(de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) for M33, that is 1.7:1, with the position angle of the major axis set to 22\u25e6 (Corbelli & Walterbos 2007).\nWe next imposed the requirement that the level of the X-ray sky\nbackground should be constant in the flat-fielded images outside\nof the masked region (i.e. we assume that there are no significant\ngradients in soft X-ray background across the full field of the survey and also that there is negligible contribution from M33 in this\nouter region). This did in fact appear to be justified based on visual\ninspection of the raw images. Next, the average level of the sky\nbackground in the un-masked region of the image was calculated.\nUsing this average value, the particle background rates for each\n\nobservation then were revised, so as to force the sky background\noutside of the masked region in each observation to this average.\nThe resulting mosaiced and flat-fielded images of M33 in the soft\nand medium bands are shown in Fig. 1.\nWe note that given the above, radial analysis of the surface\nbrightness distributions contained within the M33 images is only\njustified for the region extending from the nucleus to a major-axis\nradius of 15\u2032 . This equates to 42% of the 2.5 region and to a radial\nlinear extent of 3.5 kpc at the distance of M33. We describe this\nregion hereafter as the inner disk of M33.\n\n2.2 Spatial masking of bright sources\nThe catalogue of sources used to produce a bright-source spatial\nmask for M33 was taken from the work of Misanovic et al. (2006),\nwho reported 350 X-ray sources across the 2.5 disk of M33 above\na luminosity of 2 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 . Ninety-two of these sources lie\nwithin the elliptical region defined in \u00a72.1 (see Table 2 for summary details). Following the methods described in OW09, a model\n\"bright-source image\" was created for M33. A surface brightness\ncut was applied to this image at a level of 0.07 pn+MOS1+MOS2\nct ks\u22121 pixel\u22121 to produce the source mask (see Fig.1). We estimate the \"spillover\" fraction of this mask, i.e. the fraction of the\nbright-source signal not contained within the masked region, to be\n\u2248 4%. This mask was used to divide the inner disk region into\ntwo components, namely a \"bright-source region\" and a \"residualemission region\" (using the terminology of OW09), which could\nthen be subject to appropriate spatial and spectral analysis1 . In the\n1 The source mask is square in the region of the very bright central source\ndue to clipping of the specified surface brightness contour at the edge of the\n4\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032 sub-image used to represent the point spread function. The leakage\n\n\fSoft X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33\nimage analysis, low-level contamination of the residual-emission\nsignal by the spillover from the bright sources was further suppressed by subtracting the simulated image from the corresponding pn+MOS image and reimposing the source mask. In contrast,\nfor spectral analysis, the spillover was accounted for by including\na bright-source contribution in the spectral fit of the residual emission.\n2.3 Spectral Extraction\nThe soft-band image in Fig. 1 demonstrates the existence of an extended emission component in addition to the population of bright\npoint sources. On the basis of the approach described earlier, we extracted the integrated pn spectrum of both the bright-source region\n(bounded by the spatial mask) and the residual-emission region\n(corresponding to the full X-ray extraction region less the sourcemasked area). This process was carried out for the three observations indicated in Table 1, which were chosen as they encompass\nthe central region of the galaxy with reasonable observation times.\nA narrow strip of one CCD contaminated by Out of Time (OoT)\nevents from the ULX was excised in each observation. The SAS\ntools arfgen and rmfgen were used to produce appropriate Auxiliary Response File (ARF) and Response Matrix File (RMF) files for\nthe source and residual galaxy regions, and the counts recorded in\nadjacent (raw) spectral channels were summed to give a minimum\nof 20 counts per spectral bin in the final set of spectra.\nThe large extent of the bright-source and residual-emission regions makes the process of determining appropriate background\nspectra more complex than for most XMM-Newton applications. In\nOW09, we used appropriately scaled spectra from an annulus surrounding the defined galaxy region and the corner regions of the\ndetector to approximate the background. This process is not viable\nfor M33 as the central galaxy field covers too large a fraction of the\nEPIC pn field of view, thus making the extraction of an adequate\nbackground region impossible. We therefore used a combination of\n\"blank-sky\" fields extracted from a region of sky close to M33 (to\nminimize the difference in the sky X-ray background) and \"filterwheel closed\" data to produce a background spectrum. Using the\nSAS tool skycast, a co-added blank-sky pn image was rotated to the\nsame attitude as each observation, and the spatial mask imposed for\nthe bright source and residual regions. Spectra were then extracted\nfrom these areas and scaled to the same exposure time as the actual observation. The same process was followed for filter-wheel\nclosed data to produce a particle background spectrum. The source\nand blank-sky spectra were then compared in the 8\u201312 keV band,\nwhere the signal is dominated by the particle background. The difference in this signal was compensated for by addition of a relevant\nfraction of the filter-wheel closed spectrum, the effect of which was\nto ensure the particle background level for source and background\nspectra was the same.\n\n3 PROPERTIES OF THE GALACTIC X-RAY EMISSION\n3.1 The contribution of luminous point sources\nThe relative proximity of M33 means that point sources in this\ngalaxy can be resolved (and excluded) down to a luminosity threshold of 2 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 (0.3\u20136 keV), which is \u223c 100 times deeper\nof flux from the bright central source is calculated with respect to the mask\nactually employed.\n\n5\n\nthan was the case for the majority galaxies in our earlier study\n(OW09). A significant fraction of X-ray luminosity deriving from\nHMXBs and LMXBs in M33 can thereby be excluded. Using a\nconversion from count-rate to luminosity derived from the spectral\nfit of the bright point source population in the galaxy, we measure\nthe summed X-ray luminosity (0.3\u20136 keV) of the bright sources\ncontained within the source mask to be 1.6 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , to\nwhich the bright ULX, M33 X-8 makes a dominant contribution.\nWe determine the X-ray luminosity of this individual source (averaged across the set of M33 survey observations) to be 1.2 \u00d7\n1039 erg s\u22121 (0.3\u20136 keV), broadly consistent with the measurements reported by Grimm et al. (2005) and Misanovic et al. (2006),\nwho report a luminosity of 8.3 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 (0.2\u20134.5 keV). This\nsource is detected within 0.6\u2032\u2032 of the optical nucleus of the galaxy\n(Dubus & Rutledge 2002), but short-term variability in its X-ray\nemission suggests that it is not the galactic nucleus itself. Analysis\nby Foschini et al. (2004) suggests that the object is a black hole of\nmass \u224810 M\u2299 accreting at a super-Eddington rate.\nTable 3 summarizes the distribution across the soft, medium\nand hard energy bands of the integrated luminosity contained\nwithin the bright-source region (with the conversion from count\nrate to flux and hence luminosity estimated from the best-fitting\nspectral models reported in \u00a74.2). The X-ray luminosity pertaining to the residual-emission component is similarly reported. The\nquoted LX figures are corrected for foreground galactic absorption.\nCorrection factors were also applied for spillover of source counts\ninto the residual-emission region and for the underlying extendedemission component contained within the source mask.\nIt is possible to estimate the integrated X-ray luminosity of point sources below our luminosity threshold, assuming\nsuch sources have similar characteristics to the resolved source\npopulation. For this, we use the Chandra M33 observations of\nGrimm et al. (2005), who study a similar area of the galaxy as considered here. Grimm et al. (2005) derive an XLF with a slope of\n-(0.74\u20130.78), which we use to estimate the total integrated LX for\nsources between 2 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 and 1 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 . The results are given in Table 3, and show that unresolved X-ray binaries\ndo not contribute significantly to the residual X-ray emission observed in the soft band, but may form a significant contribution to\nthe emission observed above 1 keV. This implies that the residualemission component largely arises as the integrated emission of\nlower-luminosity source populations such as cataclysmic variables\nand active binaries plus truly diffuse emission associated with the\ninner disk of M33, presumably energized by the collective effect of\nsupernovae explosions and stellar winds.\n3.2 Morphology of the soft X-ray emission\nM33 contains a two-armed grand-design spiral structure with spiral arms extending to a radius of 10\u2032 as observed in the near infrared (Regan & Vogel 1994), along with a bar structure in the\ninner 1.5\u2032 . Far infrared and radio observations confirm this structure, with the southern spiral arm the most prominent emission region in the galaxy across all of these wavebands (Hippelein et al.\n2003; Tabatabaei et al. 2007). The soft X-ray image of M33 (Fig. 1)\nclearly shows substantial, apparently diffuse emission distributed\nacross the inner disk of the galaxy, with the overlaying pattern\nof the spiral structure particularly pronounced in the region of the\nsouthern arm. Narrow X-ray structures are similarly observed along\nthe northern spiral arm, although they are noticeably less luminous.\nThe soft X-ray emission can be traced out to a radius of 15\u2032 beyond\nwhich the signal drops below the level of the X-ray background.\n\n\f6\n\nR.A.Owen & R.S.

The FUV data are from\nGALEX (Gil de Paz et al. 2007) and the K-band data from the\n2MASS survey (Skrutskie et al. 2006; mosaic images provided by\nT. Jarrett (IPAC)). The GALEX and K-band images were resampled\nto the same spatial scale as the XMM-Newton images, and were\nthen lightly smoothed with a gaussian mask with \u03c3 \u2248 4\u2032\u2032 (roughly\nmatching the XMM point-spread function). The FUV emission\ntraces the locations of recent star formation, which in turn map\nout an underlying spiral structure. In contrast the K-band emission\nshows a relatively smooth azimuthal distribution coupled with a\nsharp decrease in the surface brightness with increasing galactocentric radius. The soft X-ray morphology appears to share some\nof the characteristics of both FUV and K-band images, and the association of the X-ray emission with each of these components is\nexplored more quantitatively in Section 5.\n\n4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS\nThe methodology outlined in \u00a72.3 was employed to extract brightsource and residual-emission spectra for the three observations\nidentified in Table 1. Only EPIC pn data were used in the spectral fitting, since the pn camera has superior sensitivity to the MOS\ncameras in the soft band. The bright-source spectrum was fitted\nseparately for each observation to allow for possible spectral variations between observations (and also to take account of the fact\nthat some of the sources encompassed by one observation might\nfall outside the field of view in another), whereas the three residualgalaxy spectra were fitted simultaneously. The spectral fitting was\ncarried out using the software package XSPEC version 12.5.\n\n4.1 Spectra of the bright-source region\nAs noted earlier, the X-ray luminosity of the bright-source population of M33 is dominated by M33 X-8, the ULX close to the\nnucleus of the galaxy. It follows that our bright-source spectra will\n\nalso be dominated by this source. We conducted the spectral fitting by first extracting and then modelling the spectrum of the\nULX alone using the combination of a multicolour black-body disk\ncomponent and a power-law continuum, both subject to some intrinsic absorption (see Foschini et al. 2004). The spectrum of the\nULX appears to change marginally between observations, reflecting the long-term spectral variability of this source. Next we modelled the bright-source spectra extracted from the full masked region by combining an unabsorbed power-law component with the\nULX contribution, the former representing the emission of the other\nbright sources (mainly LMXBs and HMXBs) in M33. Fig. 2 (top\npanel) illustrates the bright-source spectrum and derived composite\nbest-fit spectral form for one of the observations. The separate contributions of M33 X-8 and the other bright sources to the composite\nbright-source spectrum are listed in Table 4 for each observation.\nWe estimate that \u223c 3% of the flux from the ULX leaks beyond the source mask into the residual galaxy region, whereas the\ncorresponding value for the other bright sources is \u223c 9% (the difference reflecting the use of a fixed surface brightness cut to define\nthe source mask). These percentages were used when modelling the\nbright-source spillover into the residual-emission region.\n\n4.2 Spectra of the residual-emission region\nThe three spectral datasets which were selected as representative\nof the residual emission are shown in Fig. 2. As a preliminary step\nthese datasets were checked for short-term variability at \u223c 0.6 keV\nindicative of the presence of OVII geocoronal SWCX emission. No\nevidence for such contamination was found and in fact the three observations give a consistent measure of the strength of the OVII line\nwhen interpreted as thermal emission from M33 (see below). Nevertheless we cannot completely rule out the presence of some residual OVII emission associated with heliospheric SWCX, for which\nthe variability timescale would be relatively long.\nThe residual-emission spectra were modelled with a combination of two thermal plasma (Mekal) components both subject to line-of-sight absorption in the Galactic foreground, NH \u223c\n7.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Kalberla et al. 2005). Initially the two thermal\n\n\fSoft X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. The EPIC spectra for M33. Top panel: The spectrum of the bright-source regions from one observation. Bottom panel: The simultaneously fitted\nspectra of the residual-galaxy region. In all cases the solid line corresponds to the best-fit spectral model (see text). The \u03c72 residuals with respect to the\nbest-fitting model are also shown in both panels.\n\ncomponents were constrained to solar metal abundances. A \"cool\"\nthermal component at kT \u2248 0.2 keV, together with a \"hot\" thermal component at kT \u2248 0.6 keV provided a reasonable fit to the\nspectral data (\u03c72\u03bd =1.05 for the fit to all three spectra). Allowing the\nmetallicity of the two thermal components to vary independently\nresulted in a constrained fit only for the cool component. With the\nabundances of the two components tied, the best fit was obtained\nfor a metallicity relative to solar of 10\u00b13%. The resulting improvement in the \u03c72 (\u03c72\u03bd =0.99 for the spectra set as a whole) was highly\nsignificant as measured by the F-test. Details of these spectral fitting results are summarised in Table 4 and the resulting best-fitting\nmodel spectrum (with subsolar abundances) is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nSeveral authors (e.g. Strickland & Stevens 1998; W07) have\nnoted that when attempting to fit low-resolution X-ray spectra pertaining to complex multi-temperature plasmas with over-simplified\none- or two-temperature models, then a requirement for strongly\nsub-solar abundances is often the outcome, alas an erroneous one.\nNotwithstanding this cautionary note, in the present case, the introduction of a sub-solar abundance does improve the spectral fit\n\nand more specifically removes a soft excess otherwise apparent in\nthe residual-galaxy spectrum below 0.5 keV. This is evidence, albeit tentative, that the low-metal abundance may not necessarily be\na fitting artifact in this case. Interestingly the adoption of sub-solar\nabundances would also compensate for the apparent soft X-ray excesses found previously in M51 and M83 (OW09), although for\nthese sources the signal to noise ratio was insufficient to give useful individual constraints. In the case of M33, the subsolar metallicity inferred from the soft X-ray spectroscopy is also in line with\nstudies of its HII regions, for which O/H abundances a factor of 2-3\nbelow solar have been reported (Crockett et al. 2006).\nThe X-ray luminosity of the residual-emission component in\nM33 is 1.2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 (0.3\u20132 keV). This is approximately 10\ntimes lower than the value inferred for the majority of the galaxies\nstudied by OW09 - consistent with M33 being a relatively lowmass system in a satellite orbit around M31.

In M33 the relative contribution of the two thermal components in the 0.3\u20132 keV\nband is 4.2:1, with the cool component dominant. M33 is therefore\nspectrally similar to M74, M101 and NGC3184, as opposed to M51\nand M83, where there is a more equal weighting between the two\nthermal components.\nWe can derive the physical properties of the diffuse gas from\nthe derived spectral parameters. If we assume that the majority of\nthe residual emission we observe is truly diffuse and is contained\nwithin a cylindrical disk of major-axis radius 15\u2032 (i.e. a linear dimension of 3.5 kpc) and half-width 0.5 kpc, we can estimate the\nelectron density, the thermal energy and cooling timescale for each\nthermal component. The results are summarised in Table 5. The\nthermal energy contained in the two components is comparable,\n\nimplying that these components they may be in rough pressure balance.\n\n5 SPATIAL ANALYSIS\nIn an earlier study (W07), we found that when we compared the\nobserved soft X-ray surface brightness distribution of M101 with\ncorresponding datasets measured in several optical to ultraviolet\nwavebands, the best correlation was obtained with the U-band image. This was interpreted in terms of an X-ray signal comprised of\ntwo distinct spatial components, namely a clumpy thin-disk component which traces the spiral arms of the galaxy, and an underlying spatially-smooth component which contributes significantly to\nthe central concentration of the soft X-ray emission. The soft X-ray\n\n\fSoft X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33\nmorphology of M33 (see \u00a73) appears to bear some similarity to that\nof M101 in that it is possible to discern both the spiral arm structure (which clearly dominates the corresponding FUV image) and\na smoother underlying component (a template for which might be\nprovided by the K-band image).\nTo explore the above idea further, we have investigated the degree to which a \"synthetic X-ray image\" produced as a linear combination of the FUV and K-band images can be made to mimic the\nobserved soft X-ray emission. To this end, the soft X-ray, FUV and\nK-band images shown in Fig.1 were all spatially masked so as to simultaneously suppress the bright X-ray point sources, several FUV\nregions with very high surface brightness and some bright foreground stars visible in the K-band image. The three images were\nthen compressed to a 1\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 pixel scale. A synthetic image formed\nby summing scaled-versions of the FUV and K-band images was\nthen compared to the corresponding soft X-ray image through the\ncomputation of a \u03c72 statistic (calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis\nand summed over the set of pixels within the elliptical inner disk\nregion defined earlier). By varying the relative contributions of the\nFUV and K-band images to the synthetic image we were thereby\nable to identify the best-fitting combination. The best fit was in fact\nobtained when the FUV template image contributed 40% of the total signal (in the synthetic image) and the K-band equivalently 60%\n(see Fig.3). This analysis confirms a direct association between recent star formation and soft X-ray emission in the inner galactic\ndisk of M33. However, it also points to a substantial contribution\nfrom an underlying component correlated with the K-band light,\nwhich in turn traces the old stellar population of the galaxy and, to\nfirst order, the galactic stellar-mass distribution (see \u00a76).\nIn OW09, we derived the azimuthally-averaged radial profiles\nof the soft X-ray emission observed in six late-type spiral galaxies\nand used these measurements, in conjunction with published SFR\ndata, to derive quantitative estimates of the ratio of the soft X-ray\nemission per unit disk area to the local star formation rate (SFR)\nper unit disk area. Here we determine the same information for\nM33 using the same methodology as OW09, except that since M33\nis of intermediate inclination, with a major/minor axis ratio of 1.7,\nin this case it is necessary to use elliptical annuli centred on the\ngalactic nucleus in order to determine the radial profiles. Due to the\npresence of the ULX near the galactic nucleus of M33, we extracted\ndata from the spatially-masked soft X-ray image between majoraxis radii of 2\u2032 and 14\u2032 , beyond which the soft X-ray emission falls\nto near the background level. The corresponding range of linear\nextent at the distance of M33 is 0.46 to 3.2 kpc. In the analysis\nwhich follows, we use the FUV and K-band radial profiles tabulated\nin Munoz-Mateos et al. (2007).\nThe K-band and soft X-ray radial profiles (Fig.4, top panel)\nshow very similar rates of fall-off between 0.5 and 3 kpc;\nMunoz-Mateos et al. (2007) quote a scale length of 1.48 kpc for the\nK-band photometry. In contrast, the FUV radial profile although of\ncomparable slope to the X-ray and K-band curves outside of 2 kpc,\nappears to flatten at smaller radii. Although, given the background\nuncertainties, we are unable to place quantitative limits on the level\nof the soft X-ray emission much beyond 3 kpc, visual inspection of\nthe X-ray images suggest that the soft X-ray signal declines very\nsharply outside of the inner-disk region. This rapid switch-off is\nreminiscent of a similar effect evident in NGC300, M74, M51 and\nM101 (OW09).\nFig. 4, (second panel) shows a comparison of the soft X-ray\nluminosity in the 0.3-1 keV band (per unit disk area) with the SFR\n(per unit disk area) (the latter as tabulated in Munoz-Mateos et al.\n2007). More specifically the ratio of these two quantities has a value\n\n9\n\nof \u2248 1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 , at a radius 0.5 kpc, with evidence for a modest decline (by a factor dex\u22480.2) across the sampled region. In order to make a direct comparison with the results\nfor the galaxies studied in OW09, we need to apply two corrections\nas follows: (i) we convert the X-ray luminosities to a broader 0.3\u2013\n2 keV band using the spectral models discussed in (\u00a74.2 - this results in an upward scaling of the X-ray/SFR ratio by 5%); (ii) we\ncorrect the X-ray luminosities to a common point source exclusion\nthreshold of LX = 1 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 (0.3-6 keV) (in the case of M33\nthis involves integrating the luminosity encompassed by its pointsource XLF over the range LX = 2 \u2212 100 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 ) - this\nresults in a further upward scaling of 50%. The resulting estimate\nof the X-ray/SFR ratio of 1 \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121\nlies towards the upper end of the range observed to date, at a very\nsimilar level to that pertaining to the inner disks of M51 and M83\n(cf. Fig.5, OW09, where for M33 the parameter log(SFR density)\nranges from -8 to -7.5)2 .\nThe soft X-ray radial profile and the stellar-mass radial profile estimated from the K-band photometry can similarly be compared. Munoz-Mateos et al. (2007) use K-band data to evaluate the stellar-mass radial profile of M33. We find that the soft\nX-ray/stellar-mass ratio remains relatively constant at \u2248 4 \u00d7\n1028 erg s\u22121 M\u2299 \u22121 , across the inner disk of M33 (Fig. 4, third\npanel). Recent studies conducted by Revnivtsev et al. (2007) and\nRevnivtsev, Vikhlinin & Sazonov (2007) have explored the relationship between unresolved X-ray emission and the stellar-mass\ndistributions for the Galactic ridge and M32, in an attempt to derive the X-ray emissivity per unit stellar mass in systems with low\nSFR. Most likely this emissivity originates in point sources associated with (intermediate) disk population objects such as active binaries and cataclysmic variables with LX between 1030 erg s\u22121 and\n1034 erg s\u22121 , together with a contribution from fainter sources,\nthe bulk of which will be coronally active stars. From these and\nother studies (e.g. NGC3379 and M31 - Revnivtsev et al. (2008);\nBogdan & Gilfanov (2008)), an X-ray to stellar mass ratio for quiescent systems (which do not contain substantial hot gas) can be\nestimated to be 4 \u2212 8 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 M\u2299 \u22121 (0.5-2 keV). This is\na factor of 5-10 lower than we derive above for M33, implying\nthat \u2248 10 \u2212 20% of the observed unresolved X-ray luminosity in\nM33 may be associated with the old stellar population. This level\nis consistent with that predicted from the extended XLF derived\nfor LMXB, relatively quiescent LMXB, cataclysmic variables and\nother source types associated with the old population.\nAs a final investigation we also considered the variation in Xray spectral hardness as deduced from images produced in two subbands, namely the 0.3\u20130.8 keV and 0.8\u20131.2 keV bands. The plot of\nspectral hardness versus radius shown in (Fig. 4, bottom panel) in\nessence tracks the relative contribution of the two thermal spectral\ncomponents identified earlier in the spectral fitting (\u00a74.2). There is\na hint of spectral softening with increasing galactocentric radius,\nsuggesting that the hotter thermal component makes a greater contribution to the total luminosity towards the centre of the galaxy.\n\n2\n\nIn the discussion section of OW09, the upper bound of the X-ray to SFR\nratio was quoted as 5 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 . This included an\nadditional scaling factor of 3.4 arising from the conversion from the SFR\nmass range employed by Munoz-Mateos et al. (2007) (0.1\u2013100 M\u2299 ) to\nthat used in Mas-Hesse, Oti-Floranes & Cervino (2008) (2\u2013120 M\u2299 ).\n\n\f10\n\nR.A.Owen & R.S. Warwick\n\nFigure 3.

Right-hand panel: The synthetic image which best matches the soft X-ray morphology.

The ellipse has a major-axis\nradius of 15\u2032 and corresponds to the X-ray analysis region.\n\n6 DISCUSSION\nThe strong correlation observed between soft X-ray and FUV\nemission in M33 confirms a direct linkage between star formation and the production of soft X-rays in this galaxy. According to current models (e.g. Cervino, Mas-Hesse & Kunth 2002:\nMas-Hesse, Oti-Floranes & Cervino 2008), following a burst of\nstar formation which gives rise to a massive star cluster, the FUV\nemission may be expected to peak on a timescale matching the lifetime of the most massive stars (\u223c 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 106 years), whereas\nthe X-ray signal reaches a maximum sometime later. In this scenario, diffuse soft X-rays are produced through the heating of bubbles within the interstellar medium to temperatures of 106\u22127 K as\na result of the mechanical energy input from the winds of massive stars created in the starburst and the eventual destruction of\nsuch stars in supernovae. Individual SNR also contribute, primarily during the free-expansion and adiabatic phases of their evolution. Occasionally luminous high-mass X-ray binaries might be\nformed in such a cluster, although here we assume that such sources\nwould be bright enough to be excluded as resolved point-sources.\nMas-Hesse, Oti-Floranes & Cervino 2008 find that following the\nonset of the starburst the diffuse soft X-ray luminosity increases\nrapidly over the first few Myr. For an instanteous burst, the Xray luminosity may then plateau and eventually decline whereas,\nif the starburst activity is ongoing then the X-ray luminosity may\ngradually rise for up to \u223c 30 Myr until the stellar formation\nand destruction process reach an equilibrium. Using the models\nof Mas-Hesse, Oti-Floranes & Cervino (2008), we find that the Xray/SFR ratio measured for the inner disk of M33 matches the predictions at \u223c 10 Myr (after the onset of an extended burst of star\nformation activity), assuming the efficiency of conversion of mechanical energy from supernovae into X-rays is 1% (cf. OW09).\nStudies of the star formation history of M33 (Wilson et al. 1988;\nWilson & Matthews 1995) have shown that several strongly emitting HII regions have undergone bursts of star formation on the\ntimescale of 10 Myr, which indicates that this model is realistic.\n\nThrough a quantitative comparison of the observed soft X-ray\nsurface brightness distribution with a synthetic image, we found\nthat roughly 40% of the X-ray signal had a spatial distribution similar to that seen in the FUV with the remaining 60% better matching the K-band distribution. In effect this represents a 40:60 split\nbetween a clumpy spiral-arm distribution and a smooth disk distribution. However, in \u00a76 we also discussed the fact that perhaps\n20% of the total observed soft X-ray emission might be directly\nassociated with the old stellar population of the galaxy (for which\nthe K-band light again serves as a tracer). If we subtract this fraction we are left with a roughly equal split between the two inferred\nspatial components of the soft X-ray emission.\nWe are now in a position to add some refinements to our\nearlier analysis in which we modelled the X-ray emitting gas as\nfilling a cylindrical disk of half-thickness 0.5 pc, extending to a\ngalactocentric radius of 3.5 kpc. As the spiral arm regions occupy at most \u223c 20% of the inner galactic disk by area, we\nmay model 40% of the emission (directly connected to the spiral arm regions) as filling 20% of the disk with a thickness of,\nsay, 200 pc. With this adjustment, the cooling timescale of the\ngas is \u223c 2 \u00d7 108 \u03b7 1/2 yr, where \u03b7 is the filling factor of the\ngas. On the basis of the dynamical analysis of M33 performed\nby Puerari (1993), narrow features initially distributed in a spiral arm pattern would be completely smeared out by differential\ngalactic rotation on timescales of 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 108 yr. For such narrow features to survive we need a much shorter cooling timescale\n(assuming radiative cooling is the dominant process) implying a\nfilling factor much less than unity. Setting \u03b7 \u223c 10\u22123 gives a cooling timescale of 6 \u00d7 106 years, comparable to the inferred lifetime\nof hot bubbles observed in our own Galaxy (Egger & Aschenbach\n1995; Breitschwerdt, de Avillez & Baumgartner 2009). As noted\nearlier, this is also roughly the timescale on which the soft Xray production maximises following the onset of a starformation\nepisode. Given the rotational period and pattern speed of the galaxy\n(Puerari 1993), this corresponds to a \u223c 6\u25e6 azimuthal offset at a\n\n\fSoft X-ray emission from the inner disk of M33\n\n11\n\nFigure 4. A comparison of the radial profile of X-ray emission with FUV emission, SFR and mass distributions in the central disk of M33. The x-axis\nrefers to the major-axis radius scaled to kpc, assuming the distance to M33 is 795 kpc. The following information is provided: Top panel: The soft X-ray\nsurface brightness versus radius (upper curve). The radial profile of the FUV emission from GALEX images (middle curve).

Such an offset would not\nbe observable in M33 in XMM-Newton data and, in fact, such effects have yet to be identified even in the higher spatial resolution\nChandra observations of other spiral galaxies (Tyler et al. 2004).\nEven after allowing for the contribution of the old stellar population, we are left with a substantial fraction of the soft X-ray emission originating in a smoothly distributed component. Since M33\nhas an intermediate inclination, it is not possible to disentangle disk\nemission from a lower-halo component. However, Strickland et al.\n(2000), in a study of 9 nearby edge-on spiral starburst and normal\ngalaxies, have managed to distinguish between unresolved disk and\n\nlower-halo components and find that the former dominates across\ntheir sample. In all but the systems with highest SFR, the luminosity of the halo emission is at least a factor of 3-4 lower than that\nobserved in the disk. In the case of M33 it therefore seems reasonable to assume that the bulk of the smoothly-varying component is\nconfined to the disk but located both in the spiral arms and inter-arm\nregions. A cooling timescale of \u223c 109 \u03b7 1/2 yr for this component\nis consistent with its smooth distribution across the inner disk of\nM33.\n\n\f12\n\nR.A.Owen & R.S. Warwick\n\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have used archival XMM-Newton observations to examine the\nresidual X-ray emission observed from M33 after the exclusion\nof the bright point source population to a limit of LX > 2 \u00d7\n1035 erg s\u22121 . Using the same methodology as in OW09, we have\ninvestigated the spectral and spatial properties of the X-ray emission within an inner disk region extending up to 3.5 kpc from the\nnucleus of the galaxy.\nThe observed X-ray spectrum can be modelled as thermal\nemission with cool and hot components of \u2248 0.2 keV and \u2248 0.6\nkeV respectively, with the cooler emission providing the dominant\ncontribution to the luminosity. There is some evidence for a subsolar metallicity consistent with other indicators of low-metallicity in\nM33.\nThe strong correlation established between X-ray and FUV\nmorphologies confirms the close linkage between X-ray emission and recent star formation. Detailed comparison of soft Xray and FUV radial profiles in the inner disk of M33 reveals the\nratio of X-ray emission to SFR to be 1 \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121\n( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 (in the 0.3-2 keV band). This matches the predictions of Mas-Hesse, Oti-Floranes & Cervino (2008) for an extended burst of star formation occurring 10 Myr ago, with an efficiency of mechanical energy conversion to X-rays of \u223c 1%.\nThe soft X-ray emission to mass ratio found for M33 is 4 \u00d7\n1028 erg s\u22121 M\u2299 \u22121 , a factor of 5 higher than the corresponding\nvalue for dwarf elliptical galaxies and spirals with low SFR. This\nimplies that up to \u223c 20% of the observed soft X-ray emission originates in the old stellar source population, in source types such as\ncataclysmic variables and active binaries.\nWith the contribution of the old stellar population subtracted,\nthe soft X-ray emission is found to be equally split between two\nspatial components, one which closely traces the spiral arms of the\ngalaxy and the other more smoothly distributed across the inner\ndisk region. The constraints on the cooling timescale implied by\nthe presence of spiral features in the soft X-ray images suggest the\npresence of a highly clumped component, encompassing sites of\non-going starformation, HII regions and hot gas bubbles. The nature\nof the smoothly distributed component is much less certain. Plausibly it may represent the integrated emission from a whole range of\nprocesses and source types including supernovae occurring in the\ninterarm regions, individual sources and source complexes with luminosity not far below the applied luminosity threshold and an accumulated distribution of hot gas which has managed to leak away\nfrom the site of its original production.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nRAO acknowledges the receipt of a PPARC/STFC research studentship.
