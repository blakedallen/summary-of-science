The crystallographic structure of these compounds resembles to some extent the structure of HTSC\nmaterials.1 It consists of alternating Re-C and Ni2 -B2\nlayers (Re is a rare earth metal). There is a point of view\nthat the electron properties of ReNi2 B2 C compounds in\nthe normal state are isotropic because of the strong carbon bond along the tetragonal c axis.2 This is supported\nby the temperature dependence of isotropical resistivity\nin the single crystal of YNi2 B2 C.3 On the other hand,\nthere is also data about a substantial anisotropy in these\ncompounds.4 In the superconducting state the experimental data are also contradictory. The upper critical fields for H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis\nand the derived superconducting parameters do not show\nany anisotropy for the YNi2 B2 C single-crystal samples\nin agreement with magnetization and torque magnetometry measurements, but a small anisotropy is observed\nfor the LuNi2 B2 C single crystals.3,5 Meanwhile, a very\nstrong anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap was\nreported for LuNi2 B2 C in the ab plane. This conclusion\nwas based on the observation of delocalized quasiparticles\nin thermal conductivity at very low temperatures.6 According to this analysis, the smallest gap differs at least\nten times from the gap in other directions. Recently, evi-\n\n\u2217 Email\n\naddress: yanson@ilt.kharkov.ua\n\ndence for the presence of nodes along h100i direction was\nprovided by the field-angle thermal conductivity,7 fieldangle heat capacity8 and ultrasonic attenuation measurements of YNi2 B2 C.9\nIn accordance with the experimental data an\nanisotropic superconducting gap function was proposed\nin Ref. 10 (see, also, Fig. 52 from the recent review11 ). In\nthat model the gap has nodes along h100i directions and\nattains the maximum values along h110i directions. In\nthe case of s + g symmetry, the elastic scattering leads\nboth to a decrease of Tc and to an \"isotropization\" of the\ngap with vanishing nodes.\nWe do not know any direct measurement of gap\nanisotropy involving the Andreev reflection.12 The STM\ntunnelling measurements at 4 K report a gap of 2.2 meV\nalong the c axis, yielding a too low ratio 2\u2206/kTc = 3.2\nfor LuNi2 B2 C.13,14 By contrast, there are point-contact\nmeasurements of the gap in the ab plane (e.g.15,16 ), which\nyield 2\u2206/kTc = 3.7\u00f73.8. The point-contact spectroscopy\nmethod in the latter measurements cannot, however, provide angular resolution of the gap anisotropy much better\nthan \u03c0/2.\nIn the present investigation we have found that both\nin the ab plane and in c direction the experimental\npoint-contact spectra cannot be fitted satisfactory with\nthe one-gap theoretical curve, even when broadened by\nan adjustable broadening parameter. Fitting the experimental spectra both at a small bias (eV < \u2206)\nand at a bias larger than \u2206 forces us to use at least\nthe two-gap fitting curve like the one for the two-band\nsuperconductor.12,17 But even the two-gap fitting with\nthe two proper broadening parameters was not good\n\n\f2\nenough to approximate the experimental characteristic\nat the middle energy region (eV \u223c \u2206). Moreover, for the\ntwo-band model one could expect transitions of Cooper\npairs between the bands to introduce an additional depairing factor, which is analogous to other depairing factors like magnetic impurities, strong magnetic fields, etc.\nIn such case the superconducting order parameter and\nthe energy gap should differ from each other, which could\nbe accounted for by using Ref. 18. Unfortunately even\nusing the latter theory satisfactory fits could not be obtained. Therefore we suggest that only a continuous gap\ndistribution with the two energy gap maxima around the\nFermi surface could satisfactorily approximate the experimental spectra at low temperature (T << Tc ). We have\ndetermined tentatively the value of these maxima and\nthe range of gap distribution which corresponds well to\nthe recent STM measurements.19\n\nthe contact. Unfortunately, a complete set of curves in\nthe whole Tmin \u2212 Tc interval was obtained only for a few\ncontacts. Because of their rather high resistance and the\nlong-duration (over 10-12 hours) of the measurements,\nmany of the contacts were broken down. The temperature interval ranges from the minimal available T (\u223c1.5\nK) to Tc .\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSome curves of the first derivatives dV /dI measured at\ndifferent temperatures on LuNi2 B2 C-Ag point contacts\nalong c axis and in the ab plane are shown in Figs. 1,2.\n\n48\n46\n\nW\n\nThe point contact measurement was performed on single crystal LuNi2 B2 C with Tc \u2243 16.9 K grown by Canfield and Bud'ko using a flux method.20 Geometrically,\nour crystal was a thin (0.1 \u223c 0.2 mm) plate with the c\naxis perpendicular to its plane. The single crystal surface always contains quite a thick layer in which superconductivity is either absent or strongly suppressed. To\nperform measurement in the ab plane, the crystal is usually cleaved and the point contact is made between a\nmetallic counterelectrode and the cleaved surface. It was\ntechnically problematic to produce a cleavage perpendicular to the c direction. In this case the crystal surface\nwas cleaned with a 10% HNO3 solution in ethanol. As\nthe measurement in the ab plane shows, both cleavage\nand etching yield identical results.\nThe point contact in the ab plane is fabricated between\nan edge of the silver electrode and a freshly cleaved (or\netched) corresponding facet of the single crystal.21 The\ndeviation from the perpendicular to the c direction might\namount about 5 \u00f7 10\u25e6 . We do not know a priori along\nwhich of the in-plane directions the contact is obtained.\nBut since we used a selection rule to choose the highest\nobservable superconducting energy gap with the largest\nnonlinearity at the gap double-minimum structure, the\ncontact axis is presumably along h110i directions, where\nthe in-plane gap is maximum. To produce contacts in\nthe c direction the traditional \"needle-anvil\" geometry\nis used. The radius of the needle is about 1-3 micron.\nThe temperature was measured using a special cryogenic\ninsert (its close analogue is described elsewhere.22 )\nThe point contact resistances varied typically from several Ohms to tens of Ohms. For detailed investigations\nwe chose the point contacts with the highest permissible\ntunneling which was controlled against the differential\nresistance maximum at zero bias and by the maximum\nnonlinearity in the dV/dI-double-minimum region, corresponding to the intact superconducting surface under\n\n44\n\nT, K\n\n42\n\n1.47\n\n)\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\n\ndV/dI (\n\nII.\n\n40\n38\n\n5.13\nLuNi B C-Ag,\n2\n\n8.0\n\n2\n\nc-direction\n\n12.0\n\n36\n\n15.0\n\n34\n\n17.5\n\n32\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nVoltage (mV)\n\nFIG. 1: Differential resistance of LuNi2 B2 C-Ag point contact\nat different temperatures.

Each curve contains several hundred of\nexperimental dots and at the scale shown in presented figures, all the curves have negligible noise. In other figures\nexperimental curves are shown by dots whose number is\ndecreased in order to be discerned. Statistically (several\ntens of contacts were examined for each direction), the\ndistance between the minima in the first derivative dV/dI\ncharacterizing the average value of the gap was 12-15%\nlarger in the ab plane compared to that in the c direction.\nThis is a very crude estimation of the c \u2194 ab anisotropy.\nThe theoretical predictions and the experimental results were compared using two approaches. First, a\nmodel was applied, which describes electrical conductivity of pure S-c-N point contacts in the presence of an\narbitrarily transparent potential barrier at the boundary\nbetween the metals. This model allows for the finite lifetime of the Cooper pairs.18 The I \u2212 V characteristics of\n\n\f3\n\n26\n\nLuNi B C-Ag,\n2\n\ndV/dI (W)\n\n2\n\nab-plane\n\n24\n22\n\nT, K\n5.0\n\n20\n\n8.8\n12.0\n\n18\n\n15.0\n\n16\n\n17.0\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nVoltage (mV)\n\nFIG. 2: Differential resistance of LuNi2 B2 C-Ag point contact\nat different temperatures.

The value u = \u03b5/\u2206\u03b5 (\u2206\u03b5 - is a complex\nenergy-independent order parameter of the superconductor), which can be found from the equation:23\n\nu=\n\n\u03b5\nu\n+ i\u03b3 \u221a\n,\n2\n\u2206\nu \u22121\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the BCS order parameter obtained from\n\u2206=\u03bb\n\nZ\u03c9D\n0\n\nd\u03b5 tanh\n\n\u0010 \u03b5 \u0011\n1\nRe \u221a\n,\n2\n2T\nu \u22121\n\n(3)\n\nand \u03b3 = 1/\u03c4S \u2206 is the pair breaking parameter (\u03c4S is\nthe mean free time during, e.g., spin-flip scattering at\nimpurities). When magnetic impurities are absent, \u03c4S\ntends to infinity and Eq. (1) coincides with the equation\nfor current in Ref. 24. The energy gap \u22060 and the order\nparameter \u2206 are related as follows:\n\u00113/2\n\u0010\n.\n\u22060 = \u2206 1 \u2212 \u03b3 2/3\n\n(4)\n\nThe other approach was based on the generalized\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model25 commonly\nused to describe S-c-N point contacts. The model allows for the finite lifetime of quasiparticles \u03c4 =h\u0304/\u0393 determined by inelastic scattering, which leads to the broadening of the density of states in the superconductor. Formally, according to the theory18 the BTK-based results\nare obtained under the condition of strong pair breaking\n(|u|\u226b1). Therefore, in the strict sense, the generalized\nBTK model contains no gap. For any infinitesimal broadening parameter \u0393, at T = 0 the density of states near\nthe Fermi surface is non-zero. In theory,18 the order parameter is a quantity analogous to the pseudogap in the\ngeneralized BTK model. In the following we use terms\n\"order parameter\" and \u03b3 for the model of Ref.18, while\nthe \"gap\" and \u0393 for the commonly used BTK model,25\nexcept special cases, where we refer to \u22060 related to the\nmodel.18\nNow we consider more closely the methods of fitting\nthe theoretical curves to the experimental results. The\niteration method commonly used in this case is quite\ngood for small broadening. However, when the broadening \u0393 is comparable with the gap (or \u03b3 > 0.3), the results\nthus obtained are ambiguous and often dependent on the\nstarting \u2206, \u0393(or \u03b3) and Z values. In our calculation, we\ntherefore used the technique of coordinate descent with\na postponed solution.\nFirst, we specified an interval in which \u2206 is searched at\na given temperature. The interval was then subdivided\ninto equidistant parts: \u22061 , \u22062 , ...\u2206n . \u03b3 and Z were fitted for each \u2206i . The procedure was as follows: after each\nstep of \u03b3 -fitting, a complete Z-fitting was performed and\nthen the next step of \u03b3-fitting was considered. Before\neach calculation of the average r.m.s. deviation F(\u2206i ),\nthe amplitudes of the fitting and the experimental curves\nwere made equal by multiplying the y-coordinate of the\nfitting curve by a scale-factor S and then shifting it along\nthe y-axis by an amount B. The values of B and S were\nchosen to minimize the deviation F(\u2206i ). The standard\nalgorithm for determination of B and S is considered, for\ninstance, in Ref. 26. As a result, for each \u2206i we found \u03b3i\nand Zi at which the difference between the shapes of the\ntheoretical and experimental curves characterized by the\nr.m.s. deviation F(\u2206i ) was the smallest one. The same\nholds for \u0393 in the BTK fitting model.25 The calculation\nfor some temperatures is shown in Fig. 3. It is evident\nthat at Tc the technique cannot ensure unambiguous results. At 14.5 K, the curve F(\u2206i ) is practically horizontal. The determination of the \u2206-value should take into\naccount other factors as well. For example, it is important that the tunneling parameter Z and the scale factor\nS should be invariant. The dependences S(\u2206) and F(\u2206)\nat T = 7.5 K are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that the\nminimum F corresponds to a certain S-value. The BTK\ncalculation of the corresponding dependences at the same\ntemperature yields broader F(\u2206) curves. Nevertheless,\nthe minima positions in these curves are quite definite.\nAt low temperatures the shapes of the theoretical and\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.16\n\n0.8\n\n0.12\n\n(arb. units)\n\n0.20\n\nc-direction\n\n0.08\n7.5 K\n\nF\n\nF\n\n(arb. units)\n\n4\n\n0.04\n\n9.5 K\n\n14.5 K\n\nc-direction\nmodel Ref. 18\n\n0.6\n\nBTK model Ref. 25\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n12 K\n0.00\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\nD\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2.4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(mV)\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 3: Averaged r.m.s. deviation F characterizing the extent of shape discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental curve as a function of \u2206.

S is a factor used to divide the\ny-coordinate of the theoretical curve to match its amplitude\nwith that of the experimental curve.\n\nthe experimental curves were in rather poor agreement\nfor all of the borocarbides investigated (Re=Er, Dy, Tm,\nLu) irrespective of the point contact orientation. The\ntemperature dependence of the r.m.s. deviation in shape\nin the c direction is shown in Fig. 5 for both models.18,25\nIt is seen that the best agreement is achieved above 7 K.\nAt T <7 K, the largest discrepancy between the shapes is\nobserved in the region of extrema. The central maximum\nof the differential resistance in the experimental curve is\nconsiderably narrower than that in the best fit,30 whereas\nthe minima are shifted to higher bias (Fig. 6).\nSome experimental curves have a kink marked with an\n\nFIG. 6: Approximation of the experimental curve with oneand two-gap models for the LuNi2 B2 C-Ag point contact in\nthe ab plane. The dotted straight lines marked with an arrow\nindicate the kink in the experimental curve which is exaggerated by the 2-gap theoretical fit.\n\narrow in Fig. 6. This shape is typical of a superconductor with two gaps of close energies. The temperature\ndependence of the broadening (pair breaking) parameter also supports the existence of two gaps. Since Lu is\na nonmagnetic material, it is natural to expect a negligible broadening (pair breaking) parameter for the Lubased borocarbide point contacts. However, that is not\nthe case, as is evident from the temperature dependences\n(Fig. 7) of the broadening (pair breaking) parameters obtained within the two models (Ref. 18 and BTK25 ).\nNote that \u03b3 and \u0393 are different quantities. In the\ngeneralized BTK model25 \u0393 is independent of the gap\nand has the gap dimensions; whereas, in the model of\n\n\f5\n\n0.4\n\nG (mV), g (dimensionless units)\n\nG, BTK Ref.25\ng, Ref.18\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nab-plane\n\n(a)\n\nThere, the total conductivity of the tunnel contact is\na sum of the \u03c0\u2212 and \u03c3\u2212band conductivities analyzed\nby applying the BTK model. To describe the resulting\ncurve, we also used a model of two independent parallelconnected point contacts with different gaps whose conductivities are additive. The contributions of these conductivities account for the part of the Fermi surface containing a particular gap. Thus, for the two-gap model an\nexperimental curve is fitted by the following expression:\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\nG, BTK Ref.25\nG, BTK Ref.25max\ng, Ref.18\ng, Ref.18max\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nc-direction\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\n10 12 14 16\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 7: Temperature dependences of the broadening and pair\nbreaking parameters for the LuNi2 B2 C-Ag point contacts in\nthe ab plane (a), and along the c axis (b). The index \"max\"\nmarks the \"wings\" fitting (see text). \"Wings\" fit for ab-plane\ngives \u03b3=0.\n\nRef. 18, \u03b3 is described as \u03b3 = 1/\u03c4S \u2206, and, for \u03b3 < 1, \u03b3\nis related to the gap \u22060 and the order parameter \u2206 as\n\u03b3 = [1 \u2212 (\u22060 /\u2206)2/3 ]3/2 . As the temperature is increased,\nboth \u0393 and \u03b3 decrease, and, at temperatures >7.5 K\nfor the ab-plane and >11 K for the c-direction, tend to\nzero. Meanwhile, the one-gap fit starts to approximate\nthe experimental curve more and more accurately. In this\ncase the one gap fit with the broadening (pair breaking)\nparameter is a tool of describing a certain average gap\n(order parameter).\nThe largest and smallest gaps can be estimated by fitting different portions of the experimental curve. In this\ncase, to match the amplitudes of the fitting and the experimental curves, we used another method. Namely, the\ny-coordinates at the central maximum and near the minima are scaled to coincide (Fig. 8). The best agreement\nin the central maximum region can give us an estimate\nof the smallest gap (curve 1), while the best agreement\nin the \"wing\" region yields the largest gap (curve 2). By\n\"wings\" we imply the portion of the experimental curve\nat biases higher than the energy gap double-minimum\nstructure in the dV/dI characteristic, namely at eV >\n\u223c 3.\nThe estimates however are rather rough.\nFurther, we follow the method of approximation of I \u2212\nV characteristics, which was calculated for the S \u2212 I \u2212 N\ncontacts of MgB2 within a two-band model in Ref. 17.\n\ndV\n=\ndI\n\nS\ndI\ndV\n\n(\u22061 , \u03b31 , Z) K +\n\ndI\ndV\n\n(\u22062 , \u03b32 , Z) (1 \u2212 K)\n\n(5)\n\nwith a proper choice of the coefficient B. Here, the coefficient K reflects the contribution of the part of the\nFermi surface having the gap \u22061 , S is the scaling factor discussed for the one-gap approximation. To obtain\nthe best agreement with the experiment, the parameters\nused in this expression are allowed to differ from those\nfound for fitting of the separate portions of the experimental curve. It appears that when the contribution\nof the smaller gap prevails, the \"wings\" fit gives smaller\nvalues. In this case, the best result is achieved with the\ntwo-gap fit (Fig. 8, curve 4, asterisks) using the parameters for curves 1 and 3, the latter is marked with dots.\nCorrespondingly, if the larger gap prevails, the centralmaximum fit gives higher values. In Fig. 6 an example of\nthe two-gap fit (asterisks) for the ab-plane is shown.\nAlthough the two-gap fit shows much better agreement in the regions both of the central maximum and\nthe \"wings\" (Figs. 6, 8 asterisks), it cannot provide a\ncomplete description of the experimental curves, especially at the double-minima structure of dV /dI, and in\nthe c direction (Fig. 8). Most likely, this is because a\ncontinuous distribution of the gaps.\nThe previous estimation of point-contact parameters in\nthe ab plane and in the c direction was made within onegap and two-gap models using the equations of Ref. 18\nand BTK25 . The results are presented in the Table. \u22061 ,\n\u22062 are the highest and lowest order parameters (the same\nas BTK gaps25 ) from the two-gap fit; \u220601 and \u220602 are\nthe energy gaps corresponding to \u22061 , \u22062 ; \u03b31 , \u03b32 are the\npair breaking parameters of the model18 for the largest\nand smallest gaps. (The same holds for the widening\nparameters \u03931 , \u03932 in the BTK model.25 ) Independently\ndetermined Z's are the tunneling parameters, which are\nthe same for the largest and smallest gaps and are thus\nquite selfconsistent. In the Table the order parameters\n(gaps) based on the two-gap fit appear along with the\ncontributions to the total conductivity from the Fermi\nsurface region with the corresponding gap. For example,\nfor the c direction contact, the contribution to the conductivity is 40% from the region with an order parameter\nof 3.2 mV and 60% from the region with 1.82 mV.\nIt is seen that within both the models,18,25 the dominant contribution to the total conductivity in the c direction is made by the Fermi surface region where the\norder parameter is lower.

However, more or\nless definite values were obtained only at the lowest temperatures because the smallest gap is estimated within a\nrelatively small part of the experimental curve (near zero\nbias). As for the largest gap, its temperature dependence\nwas traced up to the moment when the calculations over\nthe entire curve and over the \"wings\" start to give similar\nresults.\nThe temperature dependences of the scale factor S in\nthe c direction are shown in Fig. 9. They were found\nfor the largest gap (\"wing\" fitting is marked with \"max\"\nthroughout) and for the average gap (entire-curve fitting)\nby the equations of Ref. 18 and BTK.25 The temperature dependences of the tunneling parameter Z are shown\nfor both models. To avoid crowding in the figure, only\nthe Z-values obtained from the entire-curve fitting are\nshown (the \"wing\" - fitting results are much the same).\nAlthough the fitting was focused on the coincidence of\ntheoretical and experimental dV /dI(V )- curves and no\nparameters were specially fixed, we can state that Z and\nS vary very little in the whole temperature interval.

The T -dependence of the largest gap\n(order parameter) was estimated from fitting over the entire\ncurve and over the \"wings\". The scatter of the points at\nT = 1.5 \u2212 4.2 K is caused by the contact instability. The\ncontact resistance becomes stable above 4.5 K.\n\nonly in magnitude but in temperature dependence as\nwell.\nLet us consider in more detail the recent STM investigation of the superconducting gap anisotropy in Lu and\nY compounds by means of STM.19 The tunneling spectra\nobtained in this work appeared to be impossible to fit in\nterms of the traditional BCS theory. For the curve shown\nin Fig. 2 of the cited paper, the zero value of the differential conductivity is seen up to 0.8 mV and the maximum\nof dI/dV, which corresponds approximately to the energy\ngap, is located at 2.3 mV. At the same time, the shape\nof the curve is permanent along the surface area much\ngreater than the coherence length. In Fig. 2 b, at energies\nslightly less than 2 mV, there is a shoulder, which could\nbe ascribed to a two-gap spectrum. Unfortunately, this\nfeature is not discussed in the cited paper. The authors\nnotice that the use of the model, where the broadening of\nthe BCS density of states is caused by the finite life time\nof quasiparticles, implies a non-zero density of states (or\ndifferential conductivity) at infinitesimal bias which is at\nodd with the experimental result. Because of that, the\nauthors of Ref. 19 use a modified density of state modeled\nby the energy gap with the Gauss distribution centered\nat \u2206 with the width \u01eb. By investigation of different parts\nof the crystal surface, the authors of the cited paper observe the correlation between the supposed anisotropy of\nthe gap expressed in \u01eb/\u2206 units and the local transition\n(critical) temperature at the given spot on the crystal\nsurface. With increase of the critical temperature under\nthe contact, both the absolute value of the gap and its\nanisotropy increase. Such a behavior corresponds to the\ns-wave pairing, since in terms of that model the elastic\n\nscattering leads to a decrease of Tc and isotropy of the\ngap.\nIn our experiment the critical temperature coincides\nfor both directions with the bulk value, as one could\nexpect in a crystal with undisturbed surface. Our parameter \u0393 allows one to estimate quantitatively the gap\nanisotropy and is similar to the parameter \u01eb/\u2206 in Ref. 19.\nNamely, \u0393 is about 1.5 times greater in the c direction\ncompared with that in the ab plane. The temperature\ninterval where our gap dependences deviate from BCS\ncurve is also about 1.5 times larger in the c direction\ncompared with that in the ab plane. Hence, we may conclude that the anisotropy of the superconducting gap in\nthe c direction is noticably greater than in the ab plane.\nNote that neither of the techniques18,25 can describe\nadequately the presumed situation because in both cases\nthe discrepancy is determined by the distribution of the\ngap over the Fermi surface. Taking into account the poor\nefficiency of the one-gap fit at low temperatures (Fig. 5)\nand the deviation of the fitting curve at the minima of\ndV /dI for the two-gap fit (see Figs. 6, 8 which give approximately the same discrepancy factor F as for the lowest temperature in Fig. 5), we can assert that the superconducting gap varies continuously over the Fermi surface. It is therefore most reasonable to describe such\ncurves in terms of a number of parallel-connected point\ncontacts having different gaps. Their contribution to the\ntotal conductivity can qualitatively account for the region of the Fermi surface containing a particular gap, as\nwas considered in Ref. 27.\nLet us illustrate this approach by fitting the experimental curves for the c- and ab-directions at the lowest temperatures, where the discrepancy is the highest\n(Figs. 6, 8). Just as the two-gap fit (5), the multigap fit\nis expressed by\ndV\n=\ndI\n\ndI\ndV\n\nS\n(\u22061 , Z) K1 + . . . +\n\ndI\ndV\n\n(\u2206n , Z) Kn\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere K1 + K2 + . . . + Kn = 1, Ki is proportional to\nthe part of the Fermi surface with the gap \u2206i , and S is\nthe scaling factor. The broadening parameter (\u03b3 or \u0393)\nwas taken to be zero, and the barrier factor Z was the\nsame for all the contributions. In this approximation the\napproaches of Refs. 18 and 25 are the same, and the order parameter coincides with the energy gap. As a first\napproximation, it is supposed that the coefficients Ki are\nlocated in the curve which is a superposition of two peaks\n(Fig. 12). The maxima of these peaks are at energies \u2206k\nand \u2206p , and their slopes are described by asymmetrical Gaussian distributions with a width at half height\nof \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 and \u03c34 . The heights of each peak are h1\nand h2 , respectively. By varying all the fitting parameters (\u2206i , hi , \u03c3k for i = 1, 2 and k = 1 \u2212 4) we minimized\nthe average r.m.s. deviation. This procedure includes\nmanually offsetting dots of the K(\u2206) fitting curve in the\nintermediate steps of the adjustment.\nThe result is shown in Figs. 13 and 14 for the c- and abdirections, respectively.

The contribution of a particular\nenergy gap correlates with its part over the Fermi surface.\nThe distribution of a particular contribution to the total conductivity is described by the Ki (\u2206i ) dependence. The shape\nof the distribution Ki (\u2206i ) is simulated by superposition of\ntwo peaks. Each peak is described by the following parameters: the energy of the central maximum \u2206k or \u2206p , half-width\nof the right and left slopes \u03c31 , \u03c32 or \u03c33 , \u03c34 , and the heights\nh1 and h2 , correspondingly. By variation of these 8 parameters we attempt to reach the best coincidence between the\nexperimental and theoretical curves.\n\nwith 8 fitting parameters and a continuous distribution of\nthe gaps matches the experimental curve very well.

It is found that at\nlow temperatures the experimental curves should be described assuming a gap distribution over the Fermi surface.

T = 1.48 K,\nZ = 0.755. Inset: the contribution to the total conductance\nfrom different parts of Fermi surface with different gaps. The\ndistribution is modeled by 31 equidistant points, \u2206min =1.0\nmeV, \u2206max =3.35 meV. The resulting curve exibits two peaks\nwith maxima at 2 meV and 3.1 meV.\n\nto the total conductivity is made by the Fermi region\nwith a smaller gap in the c direction and by the Fermi\nregion with a greater gap in the ab plane. At T \u2243 1.5 K\nthe largest and the smallest order parameters in the c\ndirection are \u2206max =3.2 meV, \u2206min =1.82 meV; in the\nab plane these are \u2206max =3.03 meV, \u2206min =2.0 meV. An\nattempt to fit the low temperature experimental curves\nshows that the gap is distributed starting from 0.8 meV.\nThis corresponds well to the recent STM observations in\nRef. 19 discussed above. We have found the deviation\nof the temperature dependent gap from the BCS theory\nfor both tested direction. This deviation is connected\nwith the impossibility to describe the gap distribution in\nterms of the one-gap model, at least at low temperatures.\nThe temperature range where the described deviation is\nobserved for the c direction, is about 1.5 times greater\n(1.5 \u00f7 11.5 K) than that in the ab plane (1.5 \u00f77.5 K).\nThe broadening parameter \u0393, allowing quantitative esti-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nL.

For superconductors with\na multiband electronic structure, the interband transitions of Cooper pairs may lead to their finite lifetime.\nPreviously, a two-band model was suggested for nickel\nborocarbide superconductors.28 The theory,18 which accounts more accurately for the force of pair breaking,\nmay explain the difference between the order parameter\nand the gap.\nOur next publication will concern the compound\nErNi2 B2 C which exhibits a magnetic transition near\nT=6 K. In this context a detailed analysis and comparison of the two theoretical approaches18,25 applied\nto LuNi2 B2 C are of paramount importance for understanding the results that can be obtained on magnetic\nErNi2 B2 C.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe single crystal samples for this study were graciously provided by P.C.
