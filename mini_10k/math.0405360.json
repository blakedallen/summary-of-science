WARD HENSON\n\nAbstract. The class of generic structures among those consisting of the measure algebra of a probability space equipped with an automorphism is axiomatizable by positive sentences interpreted using an approximate semantics. The\nseparable generic structures of this kind are exactly the ones isomorphic to\nthe measure algebra of a standard Lebesgue space equipped with an aperiodic\nmeasure-preserving automorphism. The corresponding theory is complete and\nhas quantifier elimination; moreover it is stable with built-in canonical bases.\nWe give an intrinsic characterization of its independence relation.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne motivation for the work presented in this paper is to understand generic\nstructures in the setting of measure algebras equipped with an automorphism. In\nrecent years, existentially closed (or \"generic\") structures have (again) attracted\na lot of attention in model theory. Several important examples in simple and\nstable theories, like algebraically closed fields, differentially closed fields, random\ngraphs and algebraically closed fields with a generic automorphism, can be seen\nas existentially closed structures. Expanding a stable structure by adding generic\npredicates, automorphisms or substructures is a common way to construct examples\nof simple theories. It is a natural idea to test these tools outside the first order\ncontext, in particular to apply them to familiar structures coming from analysis\nand probability. The study of some generic expansions of Hilbert spaces is carried\nin [5]. In this paper we examine measure algebras of probability spaces extended\nby a generic automorphism.\nThe authors are grateful to Itay Ben-Yaacov for suggesting that we study the subject of this\npaper and to Joseph Rosenblatt and Yevgeny Gordon for helpful conversations. Research of the\nsecond author was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0140677.\n1\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n2\n\nA second motivation for this paper comes from the more general objective of\nunderstanding the model theory of probability spaces equipped with an automorphism. Said differently, it is the connections between model theory and ergodic\ntheory that are being explored here, from a very general point of view. It is not\nsurprising that some of this general theory might be needed to study generic structures. However, it turns out that the connection between these two projects is much\ncloser than could be expected. Indeed, a generic structure in this setting turns out\nto be essentially the same as a probability space equipped with an aperiodic automorphism (i.e., one for which the set of points with a finite period has measure\nzero). Moreover, the theory of an arbitrary probability space with an automorphism can be reduced to the theory of its aperiodic part in a simple and direct\nway.\nThe model theoretic background for this paper comes largely from [10], suitably generalized for metric structures. On a probability space there is a canonical\npseudometric, obtained by taking the distance between sets to be the measure of\ntheir symmetric difference. The quotient structure which turns this distance into a\nmetric is exactly the measure algebra of the original probability space: identify two\nsets if they differ by a set of measure zero. Any automorphism of the probability\nspace induces one on the measure algebra. A full discussion of these structures\nfrom a point of view very close to what we take here can be found in Chapter 7\nof [19]. In general, an automorphism of a measure algebra need not arise from a\npoint map of the underlying probability space. However, if the measure algebra is\nseparable (as a metric space; equivalently, if it is countably generated as a measure\nalgebra) then it is isomorphic to the measure algebra of a Lebesgue space and all\nof its automorphisms arise from point maps.\nThe study of aperiodic maps on Lebesgue spaces is one of the fundamental parts\nof ergodic theory. The basics of the theory of Lebesgue spaces and of aperiodic\nmaps on such spaces is due to Rokhlin. In section two we introduce the basic\ndefinitions and tools that we need from analysis. Among them is Rokhlin's theorem\non aperiodic maps (stated here as Theorem 2.5), which is a fundamental tool for\nthis paper.\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n3\n\nStability in probability spaces was studied by Ben-Yaacov in [2]. In section three\nwe present some of the results from [2], but we translate them to the language of\npositive formulas (see [10]). In particular we show that the approximate positive\ntheory of atomless probability spaces is well behaved from the model theoretic point\nof view: it has quantifier elimination, is separably categorical and is superstable\nwith respect to the topology generated by the distance metric in the space of types.\nWe also prove the definability of this distance metric and introduce the notion of\nbuilt-in canonical bases. For this section we expect the reader to be familiar with\nthe notions from [10], in a modified form suitable to the metric structures that are\nstudied here.\nIn section four we construct an axiomatization (denoted by TA ) that isolates\nthe aperiodic expansions among the atomless probability spaces expanded by an\nautomorphism. We prove that the class of models of these axioms agree with\nthe existentially closed models of the approximate theory of probability spaces\nexpanded by an automorphism. In this section we also show that TA has quantifier\nelimination.\nThe fifth section is dedicated to showing the stability of the theory TA and\ngiving a natural characterization of non-dividing. We also prove that TA has builtin canonical bases.\nEntropy is an additive rank defined in ergodic theory. In section six we review\nits properties and state some of its model theoretic consequences.\nIn section seven we use the properties of entropy to show that the types in TA of\nfinite tuples over a set of parameters B are either non-principal or they belong to the\ndefinable closure of B. Using an argument like one that has been applied to ACFA,\nas well as the properties of entropy, we generalize a theorem of ergodic theory and\nshow that the types of transformally independent elements are orthogonal to the\ntypes of transformally definable elements (see Definition 6.6).\nFinally in the last section we discuss the model theory of an arbitrary (not necessarily atomless) probability space extended by a general (not necessarily aperiodic)\nautomorphism. We show the approximate positive theory of such a structure is\neasily reduced to the theory of its aperiodic part.\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n4\n\n2. Probability spaces, Lebesgue spaces and aperiodic maps\nIn this section we present the basic information about probability spaces including Lebesgue spaces, their measure algebras of events, and aperiodic maps.\nA probability space is a triple (X, B, P ), where X is a space, B is a \u03c3-algebra\nof subsets of X and P is a measure on B such that P (X) = 1. We say that a\nprobability space (X, B, P ) is atomless if for any B \u2208 B such that P (B) > 0, there\nare B1 , B2 \u2208 B such that B = B1 \u222a B2 , B1 and B2 are disjoint and P (B1 ) > 0,\nP (B2 ) > 0.\nWe say that A1 , A2 \u2208 B determine the same event, if the symmetric difference of\nthe sets, denoted byA1 \u25b3A2 , has measure zero. We denote the class of A under this\nequivalence relation by a. Throughout this section lower case letters will stand for\nevents and capital letters either for elements of the \u03c3-algebra or for sets of events.\nThe operations of complement, union and intersection are well defined for events.\nWe call events(X, B, P ) a measure algebra and the pair (events(X, B, P ), P ) a measured algebra.\nWhenever C \u2282 B is a \u03c3-subalgebra, we denote by events(C, P ) the measure\nalgebra of events coming from C with respect to P . Whenever P is clear from\ncontext, we just write events(C). Conversely, whenever C \u2282 events(X, B, P ), we\ndenote by hCi the \u03c3-subalgebra of B generated by the elements {A \u2208 B : a \u2208 C}.\nThere are two approaches to understand isomorphisms on probability spaces.\nOn the one hand, we have point maps between the spaces, on the other, measure\npreserving maps between measured algebras.\n2.1. Definition. Let (X1 , B1 , m1 ), (X2 , B2 , m2 ) be probability spaces and let B\u03021 =\nevents(X1 , B1 , m1 ), B\u03022 = events(X2 , B2 , m2 ) be their measure algebras. By an\nisomorphism of the measured algebras we mean a bijection \u03a6 : B\u03022 \u2192 B\u03021 which preserves complements, countable unions and intersections and satisfies m1 (\u03a6(B\u0302)) =\nm2 (B\u0302) for all B\u0302 \u2208 B\u03022 . The probability spaces are said to be conjugate if their\nmeasured algebras are isomorphic.\n2.2. Definition. Let (X1 , B1 , m1 ), (X2 , B2 , m2 ) be probability spaces and let B\u03021 =\nevents(X1 , B1 , m1 ), B\u03022 = events(X2 , B2 , m2 ) be their measure algebras. Let M1 \u2208\nB1 , M2 \u2208 B2 with m1 (M1 ) = 1 = m2 (M2 ). An invertible measure preserving\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n5\n\ntransformation \u03c6 : M1 \u2192 M2 is called an isomorphism between (X1 , B1 , m1 ) and\n(X2 , B2 , m2 ). If (X1 , B1 , m1 ) = (X2 , B2 , m2 ), we call \u03c6 an automorphism. The induced map \u03c6 : B\u03021 \u2192 B\u03022 is called an induced isomorphism of the measured algebras.\nTo bridge the gap between these two approaches we need to know how point maps\nare related to maps of measured algebras. Clearly any two isomorphic probability\nspaces are conjugate; however, the converse does not hold in general. The next\ndefinition concerns a well-known special class of probability spaces which are well\nbehaved from this point of view.\n\n2.3. Definition. A probability space (X, B, m) is a Lebesgue space if it is isomorphic\nto a probability space which is the disjoint union of a countable (or finite) set\nof points {y1 , y2 , . . . }, each of positive measure, and the space ([0, s], L([0, s]), l),\nwhere L([0, s]) is the Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra of [0, s] and l is Lebesgue measure. Here\nP\u221e\ns = 1 \u2212 i=1 pi , where pi > 0 is the measure of {yi }.\nThe theory of Lebesgue spaces was developed by Rokhlin. On these spaces the\nnotion of isomorphism and conjugacy coincide (see Theorem 2.2 in [21]). Thus, as\nlong as we work on Lebesgue spaces, we can switch between point maps and maps\non the measured algebra of events.\nFor the rest of this section we fix (X, B, m) an atomless Lebesgue space. It is\nshown in [9] that for any A, B \u2208 B such that m(A) = m(B), there is an automorphism \u03b7 of the space such that \u03bc(\u03b7(A)\u25b3B) = 0.\nLet G be the group of measure preserving automorphisms on (X, B, m), where\nwe identify two maps if they agree on a set of measure one. There is a natural representation of G in B(L2 (X, B, m)) (the space of bounded linear operators on L2 (X, B, \u03bc)); it sends \u03c4 \u2208 G to the unitary operator U\u03c4 defined for all\nf \u2208 L2 (X, B, \u03bc) by U\u03c4 (f ) = f \u25e6 \u03c4 . The norm topology on B(L2 (X, B, \u03bc)) pulls back\nto a group topology on G, which is called in [9] the uniform topology on G. For\n\u03c4, \u03b7 \u2208 G, let \u03c1(\u03c4, \u03b7) = m({x \u2208 X : \u03c4 (x) 6= \u03b7(x)}). It is shown in [9] that \u03c1 is a\nmetric for the uniform topology.\nFor the rest of this section we will study aperiodic maps and their properties. A\ngood source for this material is the book of Halmos [9] on ergodic theory.\n\n\f6\n\nAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n2.4. Definition. Let (Y, C, \u03bc) be an atomless probability space and let \u03c4 be an\nautomorphism of (Y, C, \u03bc). We say that \u03c4 is aperiodic if for every n \u2208 N+ , the set\n{x \u2208 X : \u03c4 n (x) = x} has measure zero.\nOne of the key tools in studying aperiodic automorphisms is the following theorem by Rokhlin:\n2.5. Theorem. (Rokhlin's Lemma [9],[18]) Let (Y, C, \u03bc) be an atomless probability\nspace and \u03c4 an aperiodic automorphism of this space. Then for every positive integer\nn and \u01eb > 0, there exist a measurable set E such that the sets E, \u03c4 (E), . . . , \u03c4 n\u22121 (E)\nare disjoint and \u03bc(\u222ai<n \u03c4 i (E)) > 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\n2.6. Definition. We call a map \u03b7 \u2208 G a cycle of period k if there is a set E \u2208 B\nsuch that E,. . . ,\u03b7 k\u22121 (E) forms a partition of X and \u03b7 k = id.\n2.7. Observation. Let \u03c4 \u2208 G be aperiodic. By Rokhlin's Lemma, for every N > 0\nthere is a cycle \u03b7 \u2208 G of period N such that \u03c1(\u03c4, \u03b7) \u2264 2/N (see [9, pp. 75]).\n2.8. Remark. Any two cycles \u03b71 , \u03b72 \u2208 G of period k are conjugate in G. Let\nE \u2208 B be such that E,. . . ,\u03b71k\u22121 (E) forms a partition of X and let F \u2208 B be such\nthat F ,. . . ,\u03b72k\u22121 (F ) forms a partition of X. Since (X, B, \u03bc) is a Lebesgue space,\nthere is a measure preserving invertible map \u03b3 such that \u03b3(E) = F . Extend \u03b3 by\ndefining for x = \u03b71i (y) \u2208 \u03b7 i (E), \u03b3(x) = \u03b72i (\u03b3(y)). Then \u03b3\u03b71 = \u03b72 \u03b3.\n2.9. Proposition. Let \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u2208 G be aperiodic. Then for every \u01eb > 0, there is a\nconjugate \u03c42\u2032 of \u03c42 such that \u03c1(\u03c41 , \u03c42\u2032 ) \u2264 \u01eb.\nProof. Let N > 0 be such that 4/N < \u01eb. By 2.7, we can find \u03b71 , \u03b72 \u2208 G cycles\nof period N such that \u03c1(\u03c4i , \u03b7i ) < 2/N for i = 1, 2. Using 2.8 we get \u03b3 \u2208 G such\nthat \u03b71 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03b72 \u03b3. Let \u03c42\u2032 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03c42 \u03b3. Then \u03c1(\u03c41 , \u03c42\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c1(\u03c41 , \u03b71 ) + \u03c1(\u03b71 , \u03c42\u2032 ) =\n\u03c1(\u03c41 , \u03b71 ) + \u03c1(\u03b72 , \u03c42 ) < 4/N .\n\n\u0003\n\n3. The model theory of probability spaces\nWe develop the model theory of probability spaces inside structures of the form\nM = (events(X, B, P ), \u2205, X,\u22121 , \u2229, \u222a, P ), where (X, B, P ) is an atomless probability\nspace, \u2205 is the event corresponding to \u2205, X is the event corresponding to X, \u222a,\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\u2229 stand for the union and intersection of events,\n\n\u22121\n\n7\n\nfor the complement of events\n\nand P for the probability of events. We also include in M a second sort for the\nordered field of real numbers and constants for all rationals. For a, b \u2208 M , let\n\u03c1(a, b) = P (a\u25b3b). The distance \u03c1 is a metric on the space of events, it is definable\nfrom P and makes M a complete metric space. We will use the tools from [10],\nmodified for metric structures, to understand the model theory of probability spaces\n(and later their expansion by generic automorphisms). We call a structure M as\nabove a probability structure.\nWe define positive formulas inductively. If q \u2208 Q and x1 , . . . , xn are variables\nin the sort of events and t(y1 , . . . , yn ) is a polynomial with coefficients in Q, then\nt(P (x1 ), . . . , P (xn )) \u2265 q and t(P (x1 ), . . . , P (xn )) \u2264 q are positive formulas. If \u03c6, \u03c8\nare positive formulas, so are \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8. Finally, if \u03c6 is a formula, so are \u2203x\u03c6\nand \u2200x\u03c6, where x is a variable in the sort of events.\nFrom an abstract point of view, the structures considered here consist of a complete metric space (M, \u03c1) equipped with operations making M a Boolean algebra\non which P (a) = \u03c1(a, 0) defines P to be a probability measure and it is translation\ninvariant under the operation of symmetric difference. In Chapter 7 of [19] there is\na full discussion of the fact that these structures are exactly the measured algebras\nof probability spaces.\nStrictly speaking [10] is formulated in the setting of normed space structures, and\nthe probability structures considered here are not of that type. However, the aspects\nof [10] on which we rely here are routinely seen to apply to probability structures,\nand we will cite results from [10] (such as the existence of highly saturated and\nhomogeneous models) without additional comment. Note that since a probability\nstructure is based on a bounded metric space (of diameter 1) there is no need to\nbound quantifiers; the key aspects of [10] that are essential to what we do here are\nthe use of positive formulas (only) and the use of an approximate semantics.\nIn this section we denote by lower case letters the events and by capital letters\nelements in the \u03c3-algebra and sets of events.\nWe need the following special case of the Radon-Nikodym theorem:\n3.1. Theorem. (Radon-Nikodym) Let (X, B, P ) be an atomless probability space, let\nC \u2282 B be a \u03c3-subalgebra and let A \u2208 B. Let a be the event corresponding to A. Then\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n8\n\nthere is a unique ga \u2208 L1 (X, C, P ) such that for any B \u2208 C,\n\nR\n\nB\n\nga dP =\n\nR\n\nB\n\n\u03c7A dP .\n\nSuch an element ga is called the conditional probability of a with respect to C and\nit is denoted by P(a|C).\n3.2. Definition. Let \u03ba be a regular cardinal larger that 2\u05d00 . We say that a metric\nstructure M in a language L is a \u03ba-universal domain if it is \u03ba-strongly homogeneous\nand \u03ba-saturated for all reducts of the language (see [10]). We call a subset C \u2282 M\nsmall if |C| < \u03ba.\n3.3. Definition. Let M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for\nits positive theory. Let C \u2282 M be small and n \u2208 N+ . By an n-type over C we\nmean the collection of positive formulas with parameters in C realized by some\ntuple \u0101 \u2208 M n .\nThe collection of n-types over a small set C is independent of the choice of M ;\nit only depends on T hA (M, c)c\u2208C .\nWe denote by T the approximate theory [10] of an atomless probability structure.\n3.4. Definition. Let M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for\nits theory. Let C \u2282 M be small. The definable closure of C, denoted by dcl(C), is\nthe collection of elements in M that are fixed under automorphisms of M fixing C\npointwise.\nThe following two lemmas are proved in [2]:\n3.5. Lemma. Let M |= T be a \u03ba-universal domain, let C \u2282 M be small and let\na1 , . . . , an ; b1 , . . . , bn \u2208 M . Then tp(a1 , . . . , an /C) = tp(b1 , . . . , bn /C) iff\nP(ai11 \u2227 * * * \u2227 ainn |hCi) = P(bi11 \u2227 * * * \u2227 binn |hCi) for all ij \u2208 {1, \u22121}, j \u2264 n.\nIn particular, any probability structure has quantifier elimination (see [10, pp. 86\u2013\n88]).\n3.6. Lemma. Let M |= T be a \u03ba-universal domain and let C \u2282 M be small. Then\ndcl(C) = events(hCi).\nThe next lemma gives another basic fact about the model theory of probability\nspaces.\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n9\n\n3.7. Lemma. The positive theory T is separably categorical.\nProof. Let N be a separable complete model of T . Then N is a probability structure\ncoming from an atomless Lebesgue space (X, B, m), where B is countably generated. Hence N is isomorphic to the probability structure coming from the standard\ninterval ([0, 1], B, m).\n\n\u0003\n\nLet M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for its theory and\ndenote by \u03c1 the metric of M . Then the collection of n-types over small sets also form\na metric space [10]. When C \u2282 M is small and p, q are n-types over C, we define\nthe d-metric by d(p, q) = inf{maxi\u2264n \u03c1(ai , bi ) : (a1 , . . . , an ) |= p, (b1 , . . . , bn ) |= q}.\nIn general, in a metric space structure the distance between types over finite sets\nneed not be definable. The next lemma shows that these expressions on probability\nstructures are actually definable (a fact known to analysts). We sketch a proof; see\nalso lemma 6.3 in [18]:\n3.8. Lemma. Let M |= T be a \u03ba-universal domain and let C \u2282 M be small. Let\n\u0101 = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 M n , b\u0304 = (b1 , . . . , bn ) \u2208 M n be partitions of the probability\nstructure. Then d(tp(\u0101/C), tp(b\u0304/C)) = maxi\u2264n kP(ai |hCi) \u2212 P(bi |hCi)k1 , where\nk k1 is the L1 -norm.\nProof. We prove the result for C = \u2205. It is sufficient to show that d(tp(\u0101), tp(b\u0304)) \u2264\nM axi\u2264n |P (ai ) \u2212 P (bi )|, since the other direction is obvious. Since T is separably categorical and C = \u2205, we can work in the probability structure of the standard Lebesgue space ([0, 1], B, P ). Let (A1 , . . . , An ) \u2208 B n , (B1 , . . . , Bn ) \u2208 B n be\npartitions of [0, 1]. Reordering the partitions if necessary, we may assume there\nis m \u2264 n such that P (Ai ) \u2265 P (Bi ) iff i \u2264 m. Let A\u2032i be the closed interval\nP\nP\n[ j<i P (Aj ), j\u2264i P (Aj )] for i \u2264 n. Write ai , bi , a\u2032i for the events determinded by\nAi , Bi and A\u2032i for i \u2264 n. Then tp(a1 , . . . , an ) = tp(a\u20321 , . . . , a\u2032n ). For i \u2264 m, let Bi\u2032\nP\nP\nbe the closed interval [ j<i P (Aj ), j<i P (Aj ) + P (Bi )]. Clearly P (A\u2032i \u25b3Bi\u2032 ) =\nP\nP\nP (Ai ) \u2212 P (Bi ) for i \u2264 m. For i > m, let Bi\u2032 be the set [ j<i P (Aj ), j\u2264i P (Aj )] \u222a\n\nDi\u2032 , where {Di\u2032 : m < i \u2264 n} are measurable sets, disjoint from each other and dis\u2032\njoint from B1\u2032 , . . . , Bm\n, A\u2032m+1 , . . . , A\u2032n , such that P (Bi ) = P (Ai ) + P (Di\u2032 ) for m <\n\ni \u2264 n. Let b\u2032i be the event determined by Bi\u2032 . Then tp(b1 , . . . , bn ) = tp(b\u20321 , . . . , b\u2032n )\nand P (a\u2032i \u25b3b\u2032i ) = |P (ai ) \u2212 P (bi )| for i \u2264 n.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nAlexander Berenstein and C.

Let C \u2282 M be small and let (I, <) be a countable infinite linear order.\nLet I = (\u0101i : i \u2208 I) be a sequence of n-tuples.

Let I = (\u03c7ai : i \u2208 \u03c9)\nbe the corresponding sequence of characteristic functions. Then the sequence I \u2032 is\nspreadable [14, pp.168]. Furthermore, for all k1 < * * * < kn \u2208 \u03c9 and i1 , . . . , in \u2208\n{\u22121, 1}, we have P(ai11 \u2227 . . . . \u2227 ainn |hCi) = P(aik11 \u2227 . . . . \u2227 aiknn |hCi).\n3.10. Definition. Let M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for\nits theory. Let d \u03040 \u2208 M m and let \u0101 \u2208 M n . We say that tp(\u0101/C \u222a d \u03040 ) does not\ndivide over C if for any indiscernible sequence I = (d \u0304i : i < \u03c9) over C, there is\n\u0101\u2032 \u2208 M n such that tp(\u0101\u2032 , d \u0304i /C) = tp(\u0101, d \u03040 /C) for all i < \u03c9. Let D \u2282 M be small.\n \u0304\nWe say that tp(\u0101/C \u222a D) does not divide over C if for all finite d \u0304 \u2282 D, tp(\u0101/C \u222a d)\ndoes not divide over C. Whenever tp(\u0101/C \u222a D) does not divide over C we say\nthat \u0101 is independent from D over C and we write \u0101 \u2323\n| C D. We say that tp(\u0101/C)\nis stationary if whenever b\u0304 \u2208 M n and D \u2283 C is small, tp(\u0101/C) = tp(b\u0304/C) and\n\u0101, b\u0304 \u2323\n| C D implies that tp(\u0101/D) = tp(b\u0304/D).\nLet \u01010 \u2208 M n and let I = (\u0101i : i \u2208 \u03c9) be an indiscernible sequence over C. We say\nthat I is a Morley sequence in tp(\u01010 /C) if for every n \u2208 N, tp(\u0101n+1 /C \u222a \u01010 * * * \u222a \u0101n )\ndoes not divide over C.\nWe refer the reader to [11, 12, 1, 3] for the properties of non-dividing (nonforking) and stable structures.\nIn [2, Theorem 2.10] there is a natural characterization of non-dividing in probability structures:\n3.11.

Proposition. Let M |= T be a \u03ba-universal domain. Then\n(1) M is stable and types over sets are stationary.\n(2) M is \u03c9-stable with respect to the d-metric.\nProof. (1) It is proved in [2, section 2.3]. (2) Let C \u2282 M be countable. We may\nassume that C is closed under finite intersections, unions and complements. Let\nStep(C) be the set of step functions in L1 (X, hCi, m) with coefficients in Q and\nlet F = {tp(a/C) : P(a|hCi) \u2208 Step(C)}. Then F is a countable set of types.\nBy Lemma 3.8, F is a dense subset of the space of 1-types over C with respect\nto the d-metric. Then by [11], M (equivalently T ) is \u03c9-stable with respect to the\nd-metric.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.13. Remark. In particular, M is superstable with respect to the d-metric: for\nany \u0101 \u2208 M n , C \u2282 M small and \u01eb > 0, there is C0 \u2282 C finite and \u0101\u2032 \u2208 M n such\nthat P (ai \u25b3a\u2032i ) < \u01eb for i = 1, . . . , n and \u0101\u2032 \u2323\n| C C. The proof follows along the same\n0\n\nlines as the proof of part (2) in the previous proposition.\nLet \u01eb > 0 and let B \u2282 C \u2282 M be small sets. We say that tp(a/C) \u01eb-divides\nover B if d(tp(a/C), tp(a\u2032 /BC)) \u2265 \u01eb, where tp(a\u2032 /C) is the (unique) non-dividing\nextension of tp(a/B). Let SU\u01eb (tp(a/B)) be the foundation rank of \u01eb-dividing of\nthe type tp(a/B). Then for any \u01eb > 0, a \u2208 M and B \u2282 M small, SU\u01eb (tp(a/B)) is\nfinite. This property translates the condition of being superstable of finite SU -rank\ninto the current metric setting.\nWe now recall some definitions from [5]. These definitions apply to general metric\nstructures (not just probability structures).\n3.14. Definition. Let M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for\nits theory. Let I, J \u2282 (M n )\u03c9 be countable indiscernible sequences. We say I and\nJ are colinear if the concatenation IJ is an indiscernible sequence. We say that\nI and J are parallel if there is another infinite indiscernible sequence K \u2282 (M n )\u03c9\nsuch that I is colinear to K and J is colinear to K.\nLet M be a metric space structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for its theory\nand assume that T hA (M ) is stable. We will show that parallelism is an equivalence\nrelation. Assume that I1 is parallel to I2 and that I2 is parallel to I3 . So there are\n\n\f12\n\nAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\nK1 = (ai : i < \u03c9) and K2 = (bi : i < \u03c9) indiscernible sequences such that all concatenations I1 K1 , I2 K1 , I2 K2 , I3 K2 are indiscernible. Let tp(a/I2 I1 I3 K1 K2 ) be the\nunique non-dividing extension of tp(a1 /I2 ). Then by stability, tp(a/I2 I1 I3 K1 K2 )\nis also the non-dividing extension of tp(b1 /I2 ). Let L be a Morley sequence in\ntp(a/I1 I2 I3 K1 K2 ). Then I1 L and I3 L are colinear, so I1 is parallel to I3 .\n3.15. Definition. Let M be a metric structure which is a \u03ba-universal domain for its\ntheory. Let C \u2282 M be small, let \u01010 \u2208 M n and assume that tp(\u01010 /A) is stationary.\nWe say that tp(\u01010 /A) has a built-in canonical base if there is a small set B \u2282 M\nsuch that for some (equivalently, any) Morley sequence I = (\u0101i : i < \u03c9) over A, the\nparallelism class of I is interdefinable with B. That is, for every automorphism \u03a8\nof M , B is fixed (pointwise) by \u03a8 if and only if the parallelism class of I is fixed\n(setwise) by \u03a8. We call B a built-in canonical base for tp(\u01010 /A). We say that M\nhas built-in canonical bases if for all C \u2282 M small, n \u2208 N and \u01010 \u2208 M n such that\ntp(\u01010 /A) is stationary, there is a built-in canonical base for tp(\u01010 /A).\n3.16. Remark. Let M |= T be a \u03ba-universal domain, let C \u2282 M be small and let\na1 , . . . , an \u2208 M . Let D be the (smallest) measure algebra making\nP(ai11 \u2227 * * * \u2227 ainn |hCi) measurable for all ij \u2208 {\u22121, 1}, j \u2264 n. Then events(D) is\na built-in canonical base for tp(a1 , . . . , an /C). An exposition of this fact from a\nslightly different perspective can be found in [2] or [4].\n4. Aperiodic algebras and quantifier elimination\nWe start by fixing the notation for the rest of the paper. Recall that we denote\nby L be the language of probability structures and by T the approximate theory of\natomless probability structures. Write L\u03c4 for the language L expanded by a unary\nfunction with symbol \u03c4 and let T\u03c4 be the theory T \u222a \"\u03c4 is an automorphism\".\nLet (X, B, \u03bc) be an atomless Lebesgue space and let M be the probability structure of (X, B, \u03bc). Let G be the group of automorphisms of this space, where we\nidentify two maps if they agree on a set of measure one. Let \u03c4, \u03c1 \u2208 G. Note that\nthe map sending A \u2208 B to \u03c1\u22121 (A) is a measure preserving automorphism that\ninduces an isomorphism between the structures (M, \u03c4 ), (M, \u03c1\u22121 \u03c4 \u03c1). Let \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u2208 G\nbe aperiodic. An application of proposition 2.9 with the values for \u01eb ranging over\nthe sequence {1/n : n \u2208 N+ }, shows that there are countable ultrapowers of (M, \u03c41 )\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n13\n\nand (M, \u03c42 ) which are isomorphic. Thus any two aperiodic transformations in a\nLebesgue space have the same approximate elementary theory. The aim of this\nsection is to study the approximate theory of probability structures expanded by\nan aperiodic point automorphism. Since the elements of a probability structure\nare events, we need to define a notion of aperiodicity with respect to the measure\nalgebra of events.\n4.1. Definition. Let (X, B, m) be a probability space, let B\u0302 be the corresponding\nmeasure algebra of events and let \u03c4 be an automorphism of the measure algebra B\u0302.\nThe map \u03c4 is called aperiodic if for all n \u2208 N+ and \u01eb > 0 there is b \u2208 B\u0302 such that\nm(b \u2229 \u03c4 n (b)) \u2264 \u01eb and |m(b) \u2212 1/2| \u2264 \u01eb.\nNote that the previous definition can be expressed by positive formulas in the\nlanguage L\u03c4 . Denote by TA the theory T\u03c4 \u222a \"\u03c4 is aperiodic\". TA is T\u03c4 plus a set of\napproximations, for every n \u2208 N, of the existence of a set b of measure 1/2 which\nis disjoint from T n (b),\n4.2. Lemma. Let (X, B, m) be a probability space and let B\u0302 be the corresponding\nmeasure algebra of events. Let \u03c4 be an automorphism of (X, B, m). Then \u03c4 is aperiodic iff the induced automorphism \u03c4 on the measured algebra (B\u0302, m) is aperiodic.\nProof. If \u03c4 is an aperiodic automorphism of (X, B, m), then Rokhlin's Lemma the\ninduced automorphism \u03c4 on the measured algebra of events is also aperiodic.\nNow assume that the induced automorphism on the measured algebra of events is\naperiodic. By a way of contradiction, assume that \u03c4 is not aperiodic automorphism\nof (X, B, \u03bc). Then for some n > 0, m({x : \u03c4 n (x) = x}) \u2265 \u01eb for some \u01eb > 0. Since \u03c4 is\nan automorphism, {x : \u03c4 n (x) = x} \u2208 B. Let a be the event corresponding to the set\n{x : \u03c4 n (x) = x} and let \u03b4 > 0 be such that 9\u03b4 < \u01eb. Since \u03c4 is aperiodic with respect\nto the measure algebra of events, there is an event b such that m(b \u2229 \u03c4 n (b)) \u2264 \u03b4 and\n|m(b) \u2212 1/2| \u2264 \u03b4. Then m(a) = m(a \u2229 b) + m(a \u2229 \u03c4 n (b) \u2229 bc ) + m(a \u2229 bc \u2229 \u03c4 n (bc )).\nObserve that m(bc \u2229\u03c4 n (bc )) = 1\u2212m(b)\u2212m(\u03c4 n(b))+m(b\u2229\u03c4 n (b)) \u2264 1\u22122(1/2\u2212\u03b4)+\u03b4 =\n3\u03b4. Since m(a) > 9\u03b4, we must have that m(a \u2229 b) > 3\u03b4 or that m(a \u2229 \u03c4 n (b)) > 3\u03b4.\nAssume that m(a \u2229 b) > 3\u03b4. Then a \u2229 b \u2282 a and thus \u03c4 n (a \u2229 b) = a \u2229 b. But\nm(b \u2229 \u03c4 n (b)) \u2264 \u03b4 which is a contradiction. A similar contradiction can be found\nwhen m(a \u2229 \u03c4 n (b)) > 3\u03b4. Thus \u03c4 has to be aperiodic.\n\n\f14\n\nAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\u0003\nThe previous Lemma shows that the two notions of aperiodicity coincide for\n\nprobability structures expanded by point automorphisms and that the approximate\npositive theory of atomless Lebesgue space expanded by an aperiodic automorphism\nis axiomatized by TA .\n4.3. Lemma. TA is complete.\nProof. Let (M1 , \u03c41 ) and (M2 , \u03c42 ) be two models of TA . Then there are separable\ncomplete models (Mi\u2032 , \u03c4i\u2032 ) |= TA which are elementarily equivalent to (Mi , \u03c4i ) for\ni = 1, 2 respectively. By separable categoricity of T , for i = 1, 2, Mi\u2032 is isomorphic\nto the probability structure associated to a Lebesgue space and \u03c4i\u2032 can be assumed\nto be a point automorphism of the underlying probability space. By the previous\nlemma, \u03c41\u2032 and \u03c42\u2032 are aperiodic automorphisms as point set maps and thus by\nProposition 2.9 we have (M1\u2032 , \u03c41\u2032 ) \u2261A (M2\u2032 , \u03c42\u2032 ).\n\n\u0003\n\n4.4. Definition. Let M be a metric structure. We say that T hA (M ) is model\ncomplete if for all N0 \u2282 N1 models of T hA (M ), N0 \u0016A N1 .\nOur next aim is to show that TA is model complete. The techniques used for the\nproof are similar to the ones used in proving the completeness of the theory TA ,\nbut now we need to include parameters.\n4.5. Lemma. Let (M, S) be a separable complete model of T\u03c4 , where S is an (n+1)shift. Let f1 , . . . , fm \u2208 M . Let (N, \u03c3) \u2283 (M, S) be a separable complete extension\nwhich is a model of T\u03c4 and in which \u03c3 is an (n + 1)-shift. Then there is : : M \u2192 N\nmeasure preserving such that \u03b7S = \u03c3\u03b7 and \u03b7(fk ) = fk for k \u2264 m.\nProof. We may assume that {f1 , . . . , fm } are the atoms of an algebra and that\nS({f1 , . . . , fm }) = {f1 , . . . , fm }. Since N is separable, we may assume that there\nis a Lebesgue space (X, B, \u03bc) such that N = events(B) and that \u03c3 is induced by\na point map (also denoted by \u03c3) such that \u03c3 n+1 = id. We may also suppose that\nM = events(C) for some complete subalgebra C of B and that S is induced by a\npoint map S such that S n+1 = id.\nLet A \u2208 C be such that (A, . . . , S n (A)) is a partition (up to measure zero) of X.\nLet F1 , . . . , Fm \u2208 C be disjoint sets such that event(Fi ) = fi for i \u2264 m. Consider\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n15\n\n\u03b7 a measure preserving bijection between (A, C \u21beA , m) and (A, B \u21beA , m) such that\n\u03b7(A \u2229 Fk ) = A \u2229 Fk for k \u2264 m. Since F1 , . . . , Fm are the atoms of an algebra, \u03b7 is\nwell defined for all x \u2208 A. Extend \u03b7 by defining, for x \u2208 A\u2229Fk , \u03b7(S i (x)) = \u03c3 i (\u03b7(x))\nfor i \u2264 n. Then \u03b7(S i (A \u2229 Fk )) = \u03c3 i (A \u2229 Fk ) for i \u2264 n, k \u2264 m and thus \u03b7(fk ) = fk\nfor k \u2264 m. By the definition of \u03b7 we also have \u03b7S = \u03c3\u03b7.\n\n\u0003\n\n4.6. Proposition. TA is model complete.\nProof. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be separable complete and let (N, \u03c41 ) |= T\u03c4 be a separable\ncomplete extension of (M, \u03c4 ). Note that (N, \u03c41 ) |= TA . Let f \u0304 = (f1 , . . . , fm ) \u2208 M m .\nBy compactness we can find a separable complete elementary extension (M1 , \u03c4 )\nof (M, \u03c4 ) such that for every n > 0 there is a \u2208 M1 such that (a, . . . , \u03c4 n (a)) forms\na partition of M1 . We can amalgamate (M1 , \u03c4 ) and (N1 , \u03c41 ) over (M, \u03c4 ) (see the\ndiscussion of relative independent joinings over a common factor in [8, Chapter 6]).\nCall this structure (N1 , \u03c41 ). To prove the proposition it suffices to show that any\nformula \u03c6(x\u0304, f \u0304) true in (N1 , \u03c41 ) and any approximation \u03c6\u2032 (x\u0304, f \u0304) of \u03c6(x\u0304, f \u0304), there is\na realization of \u03c6\u2032 (x\u0304, f \u0304) in (M1 , \u03c4 ).\nSince (N1 , \u03c41 ) is separable, we may assume that there is an atomless Lebesgue\nspace (X, B, \u03bc) such that N1 = events(X, B, \u03bc) and \u03c41 is an automorphism of\n(X, B, \u03bc). Furthermore, we may assume that there is a complete \u03c3-subalgebra\nC of B such that M1 = events(C) and that \u03c4 is an isomorphism of (X, C, \u03bc).\nFor every n > 0, we will construct a measure preserving isomorphism \u03b7n : (X, C, \u03bc) \u2192\n(X, B, \u03bc) such that \u03b7n (fk ) = fk for k \u2264 m and \u03c1M1 (\u03b7n\u22121 \u03c41 \u03b7n , \u03c4 ) \u2264 2/(n + 1).\nWe start by finding approximations of \u03c4 and \u03c41 by (n + 1)-shifts. Let A \u2208 C\nwith event a. For x \u2208 \u222ai<n \u03c41i (A), let \u03c31 (x) = \u03c41 (x) and for x \u2208 \u03c41n (A), let \u03c31 (x) =\n\u03c41\u2212n (x). Then \u03c31n+1 = id, (a, . . . , \u03c31n (a)) is a partition of M1 and \u03c1(\u03c41 , \u03c31 ) \u2264\n1/(n+1). For x \u2208 \u222ai<n \u03c4 i (A), let \u03c3(x) = \u03c4 (x) and for x \u2208 \u03c4 n (A), let \u03c3(x) = \u03c4 \u2212n (x).\nThen \u03c3 n+1 = id and \u03c1(\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2264 1/(n + 1).\nBy Lemma 4.5 there is a measure preserving isomorphism \u03b7n : (X, C, \u03bc) \u2192 (X, B, \u03bc)\nsuch that \u03b7n \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u03b7n and \u03b7n (fk ) = fk for k \u2264 m. Note that \u03c1(\u03b7n\u22121 \u03c41 \u03b7n , \u03c4 ) \u2264\n2/(n + 1).\nSince n was arbitrary, we can find countable ultrapowers (M2 , \u03c4 ) and (N2 , \u03c4 )\nof (M1 , \u03c4 ) and (N1 , \u03c4 ) respectively such that (M2 , \u03c4, f \u0304) \u223c\n= (N2 , \u03c4, f \u0304) and hence\n(M1 , \u03c4, f \u0304) \u2261A (N1 , \u03c4, f \u0304).\n\u0003\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C.

Lemma. The models of TA are precisely the existentially closed models of T\u03c4 .\nProof. Since any model of T\u03c4 can be extended to a model of TA , an existentially\nclosed model of T\u03c4 is a model of TA . The other direction follows from the previous\nproposition.\n\n\u0003\n\n4.9. Remark. The authors initially studied this subject to answer a question of Itay\nBen-Yaacov about the axiomatizability of probability spaces expanded by generic\nautomorphisms. Indeed, TA is an axiomatization for this class. Another axiomatization comes from a suggestion of Anand Pillay. It is given by the following axioms\nindexed by \u01eb \u2208 Q+ and the arities of x\u0304 and \u0101:\n(ECN) \u2200x\u0304\u2200\u0233\u2200\u0101 d(tp(\u03c4 (x\u0304)/\u03c4 (\u0101)), tp(\u0233/\u03c4 (\u0101))) \u2265 \u01eb \u2228\nd(tp(x\u0304\u2032 /\u0101\u03c4 (\u0101)), tp(x\u0304/\u0101\u03c4 (\u0101))) \u2265 \u01eb \u2228\nd(tp(\u0233 \u2032 /\u0101\u03c4 (\u0101)), tp(\u0233/\u0101\u03c4 (\u0101))) \u2265 \u01eb \u2228\n\u2203c\u0304 d(tp(c\u0304, \u03c4 (c\u0304)/\u0101, \u03c4 (\u0101)), tp(x\u0304, \u0233/\u0101, \u03c4 (\u0101))) \u2264 2\u01eb.\n \u0304 \u03c4 (d)),\n \u0304 tp(\u0233 \u2032 /d,\n \u0304 \u03c4 (d))\n \u0304 are the\nwhere d is the distance between types and tp(x\u0304\u2032 /d,\n \u0304 and tp(\u0233/\u03c4 (d))\n \u0304 respectively.\nunique non-dividing extensions of tp(x\u0304/d)\nThis axiomatization says that any possible extension of an automorphism \u03c4 is\napproximately realized already in \u03c4 . It is an exercise to the reader to show that\nthis scheme axiomatizes the existentially closed models of T\u03c4 .\nThe advantage of this approach is that it can also be used to show the existence\nof a model companion for other structures, for example Hilbert spaces expanded\nby an automorphism.\n4.10. Observation. The theory ACFA in characteristic 0 can be seen as the limit,\nas the characteristic p goes to infinity, of the theories of algebraically closed fields\nexpanded by adding the Frobenius automorphism. The theory of aperiodic automorphisms on atomless Lebesgue spaces is the limit, as n goes to infinity, of the\ntheory of a probability space formed by n points of equal weight with a cycle of\nperiod n.\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n17\n\nLet (M, \u03c4 ) be a \u03ba-universal domain of TA . We denote the definable closure in\nthe structure M by dcl and the definable closure in the structure (M, \u03c4 ) by dcl\u03c4 .\nIt is easy to give, as in first order theories (see [7]), a characterization for dcl\u03c4 :\n4.11. Lemma. Let (M, \u03c4 ) be a \u03ba-universal domain of TA and let \u0101 \u2282 M . Then\ndcl\u03c4 (\u0101) = dcl({\u03c4 i (\u0101) : i \u2208 Z}).\nIn ergodic theory, joinings give different ways of amalgamating two probability\nstructures with automorphisms into a common extension. In particular, the relative independent joining over a common factor (described in Section 6.1 of [8])\ncorresponds to the model-theoretic free amalgamation. Since TA is model complete\nand has the amalgamation property, it should have quantifier elimination. That is\nthe content of the next theorem:\n4.12. Theorem. TA has elimination of quantifiers.\nProof. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA and let \u0101, b\u0304 \u2208 M n such that qf tp\u03c4 (\u0101) = qf tp\u03c4 (b\u0304). Then\nfor every k < \u03c9, tp(\u03c4 \u2212k (\u0101), . . . , \u03c4 k (\u0101)) = tp(\u03c4 \u2212k (b\u0304), . . . , \u03c4 k (b\u0304)). Let f be an Lisomorphism taking (\u03c4 i (\u0101) : i \u2208 Z) to (\u03c4 i (b\u0304) : i \u2208 Z). The map f has a unique\nextension from dcl\u03c4 (\u0101) = dcl(\u03c4 i (\u0101) : i \u2208 Z) to dcl\u03c4 (b\u0304), which is an L-isomorphism.\nBy stationarity of types in atomless probability spaces, the sets dcl\u03c4 (\u0101) and dcl\u03c4 (b\u0304)\nare amalgamation bases in T\u03c4 . Since (M, \u03c4 ) is existentially closed by a back and\nforth argument f is an L\u03c4 -isomorphism and tp\u03c4 (\u0101) = tp\u03c4 (b\u0304).\n\n\u0003\n\n5. Independence and stability\nIn this section we introduce an abstract notion of independence and show that it\nagrees with non-dividing. This idea follows the approach used in [7] to characterize\nnon-dividing inside a first order stable structure expanded by a generic automorphism. We reserve the use of the word independence for independence of events in\nthe sense of probability structures. Fix (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA a \u03ba-universal domain.\n5.1. Definition. Let \u0101 \u2208 M n and let C \u2282 B \u2282 M be small. We say that \u0101 is\n\u03c4 -independent from B over C and write \u0101 \u2323\n|\u03c4 C B if dcl\u03c4 (\u0101) is independent from\ndcl\u03c4 (B) over dcl\u03c4 (C).\nThe next lemma shows that types in TA are stationary with respect to \u03c4 independence. The main tool for this proof is quantifier elimination for TA .\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n18\n\n5.2. Proposition. Let \u0101, b\u0304 \u2208 M n and let C \u2282 D \u2282 M . Suppose that tp\u03c4 (\u0101/C) =\ntp\u03c4 (b\u0304/C) and that \u0101 \u2323\n|\u03c4 C D and b\u0304 \u2323\n|\u03c4 C D. Then tp\u03c4 (\u0101/D) = tp\u03c4 (b\u0304/D).\nProof. Let \u0101, b\u0304, C, D be as above. Then for every k < \u03c9,\ntp(\u03c4 \u2212k (\u0101), . . . , \u03c4 k (\u0101))/ dcl\u03c4 (C)) = tp(\u03c4 \u2212k (b\u0304), . . . , \u03c4 k (b\u0304))/ dcl\u03c4 (C)).\nBy stationarity of types in probability spaces, we get tp(\u03c4 \u2212k (\u0101), . . . , \u03c4 k (\u0101))/ dcl\u03c4 (D)) =\ntp(\u03c4 \u2212k (b\u0304), . . . , \u03c4 k (b\u0304))/ dcl\u03c4 (D)). Since this equality holds for all k < \u03c9, by quantifier\nelimination of TA , tp\u03c4 (\u0101/D) = tp\u03c4 (b\u0304/D).\n\n\u0003\n\n5.3. Corollary. The theory TA is stable and \u03c4 -independence agrees with nondividing.\nProof. By the properties of independence in M , it is clear that \u03c4 -independence\nsatisfies: symmetry, transitivity, extension, local character and finite character (see\n[20] for the definition of these properties). By the previous proposition it also\nsatisfies stationarity. Since non-dividing can be characterized by these properties,\n\u03c4 -independence agrees with non-dividing (see [20], [3]) and TA is stable.\n\n\u0003\n\n5.4. Remark. Since T has built-in canonical bases (see Definition 3.15, Remark\n3.16), TA will also have built-in canonical bases. For any c1 , . . . , cm \u2208 M and\nA \u2282 M , denote by Cb(c1 , . . . , cm /A) a built-in canonical base for tp(c1 , . . . , cm /A).\nLet \u0101 = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) \u2208 M n and let A \u2282 M be such that A = dcl\u03c4 (A).\nThen a built-in canonical base for tp\u03c4 (\u0101/A) is \u222a{Cb(c1 , . . . , cm /A) : c1 , . . . , cm \u2208\ndcl\u03c4 (a1 , . . . , an ), m < \u03c9}. This is reminiscent of what happens in ACFA, see [15, 6].\nRoughly speaking, stability as developed in [11, 12, 13] corresponds to the study\nof universal domains that have a bound on the size of the space of types. This\nanalysis is carried out through the density character of uniform structures. Independence is studied through the notion of non-forking and stability turns out to be\nequivalent to definability of types (see section 3 in [12]). The analysis of independence developed in [3] is based on the notion of non-dividing (defined by Shelah). A\nstructure is stable when it has definability of types (see section 2 in [3]) and inside\na stable structure, non-dividing can be characterized by its properties. Hence both\npoints of view coincide and furthermore, non-forking in [11, 12, 13] corresponds to\nnon-dividing from [3].\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n19\n\nThe previous corollary shows that TA is stable. Now we will explicitly count\ntypes. We will show that TA is \u03c9-stable with respect the minimal uniform structure,\nwhich was introduced in [11]. We recall the definition:\n5.5. Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be a \u03ba-universal domain and let B \u2282 M\nbe small.

Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA , let A \u2282 M and let b \u2208 M . We say that b\nis m-step independent over A if tp(b/A \u222a {\u03c4 j (b) : j \u2265 1}) does not divide over\nA \u222a {\u03c4 j (b) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m}.\n5.7. Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA , let A \u2282 M be a subalgebra and let b \u2208 M . We\nsay that b is m-step simple over A if for any c \u2208 dcl(\u03c4 i (b) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m), P(c|hAi) is\na finite sum of rational multiples of characteristic functions of elements of A.\n5.8. Theorem. TA is \u03c9-stable with respect to the minimal uniform structure.\nProof. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be a \u03ba-universal domain and let A0 \u2282 M be countable.\nWe need to prove that there is a countable dense subset of the space of \u03c4 -types over\nA0 with respect to the minimal uniform structure. Let A1 = \u222ai\u2208Z \u03c4 i (A0 ), so A1 is\ncountable. Finally let A be the boolean algebra generated by A1 . Note that A is\ncountable. To show \u03c9-stability, it is enough to find a countable dense subset of the\nspace of \u03c4 -types over A with respect to the minimal uniform structure. Let F be\nthe set of all \u03c4 -types tp\u03c4 (b/A) where there is m such that b is m-step simple over\nA and m-step independent over A.

Ranks\n\nIn this section we will follow [21] and review the definition and the main properties of entropy. Let (X, B, P ) be a probability space.\n6.1. Definition. let A be a finite subalgebra of B with atoms {A1 , . . . , Ak }. Let C\nbe a sub-\u03c3-algebra of B. Then the entropy of A given C is\nZ X\nP(Ai |C) ln(P(Ai |C))dP\nH(A/C) = \u2212\ni\u2264k\n\nWe write H(A) for H(A/{\u2205, X}). If A and C are \u03c3-algebras, we denote by A \u2228 C\nthe \u03c3-algebra generated by A and C.\n6.2. Fact. Let A, C be finite subalgebras of B and let D be a sub-\u03c3-algebra of B.\nThen:\n(1) H(A \u2228 C/D) = H(A/D) + H(C/A \u2228 D).(Additivity)\n(2) A \u2282 C =\u21d2 H(A/D) \u2264 H(C/D).\n(3) H(A/D) \u2265 H(A/C \u2228 D),\n(4) If \u03c4 is a measure preserving automorphism, H(\u03c4 \u22121 A/\u03c4 \u22121 D) = H(A/D)\n(5) H(A/C \u2228 D) = H(A/D) iff A is independent from C over D.\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n21\n\nThe first four properties are proved in Section 4.3 in [21]. A special case of\nproperty (5), when D is the trivial algebra {\u2205, X}, is also proved there. Property\n(5) was pointed out by Ben-Yaacov to the authors and it can be proved using the\nideas presented in Section 4.3 in [21].\n6.3. Definition. Let \u03c4 : X \u2192 X be a measure preserving transformation of the\nprobability space (X, B, m). If A is a finite subset of B, then\nn\u22121\n_\n1\n\u03c4 \u2212i A)\nH(\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=0\n\nh(\u03c4, A) = lim\n\nis called the entropy of \u03c4 with respect to A.\nThe value h(\u03c4 ) = sup{h(\u03c4, A) : A is a finite subset of B} is called the entropy of\n\u03c4.\n6.4. Fact. Let A be a finite subalgebra of B and \u03c4 a measure preserving automorphism of (X, B, m). Then:\n(1) h(\u03c4, A) \u2264 H(A).\nW\n(2) For n > 0, h(\u03c4, A) = h(\u03c4, i<n \u03c4 \u2212i A).\nW\n\u2212i\n(3) h(\u03c4, A) = 0 iff A \u2282 \u221e\nA.\ni=1 \u03c4\nWn\n(4) h(\u03c4, A) = limn\u2192\u221e H(A/ i=1 \u03c4 \u2212i (A)).\nThe proofs can be found in Section 4.5 of [21].\n6.5. Definition. Let (X, B, m) be an atomless probability space and let \u03c4 be an\naperiodic measure preserving automorphism of this space. Let M be the probability\nstructure associated to (X, B, m). Let \u0101 = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 M n and let D \u2282 M .\nLet A1 , . . . , An \u2208 B with events a1 , . . . , an respectively and let A be the algebra\ngenerated by A1 , . . . , An . Define H(\u0101/D), the entropy of \u0101 with respect to D, to\nbe H(A/hDi). Define the entropy of \u03c4 with respect to \u0101 to be h(\u03c4, A) and denote\nit by h(\u03c4, \u0101). Similarly, for C = {a1 , . . . , an }, let H(C/D) = H(A/hDi) and call it\nthe entropy of C with respect to D. Finally let the entropy of \u03c4 with respect to C\nbe h(\u03c4, A) and denote it by h(\u03c4, C).\nThe properties listed in 6.2 and 6.4 still hold when measurable sets are replaced\nby events.\n\n\f22\n\nAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n6.6. Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA , let \u0101 \u2208 M n . We say that \u0101 is transformally\nindependent if {\u03c4 i (\u0101) : i \u2208 Z} is an independent sequence in M . We say that \u0101 is\ntransformally definable if \u0101 \u2208 dcl(\u03c4 \u2212i (\u0101) : i > 0)\n6.7. Remark. Let (M, \u03c4 ) be a model of TA , let \u0101 \u2208 M n . By the additivity of\nentropy, \u0101 is transformally independent if and only if h(\u03c4, \u0101) = H(\u0101). By property\n(3) in Fact 6.4, \u0101 is transformally definable if and only if h(\u03c4, \u0101) = 0. We call\nthe algebra formed by the transformally definable elements the Pinsker algebra\n(compare with [21]).\n6.8. Remark. It is shown in Section 4.9 of [21] that for every r \u2208 R+ , there is\na separable model (Mr , \u03c4r ) |= TA such that h(\u03c4r ) = r. It follows that h(\u03c4 ) = \u221e\nwhenever (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA is \u05d01 -saturated.\n6.9. Observation. We can use entropy to characterize the generic elements of the\ngroups (M, \u25b3), where \u25b3 is the symmetric difference. When we work in M (just the\nprobability structure), it is shown in [2] that the generics of the group are the events\nof measure 1/2. Note that if a \u2208 M , then H(a) \u2264 ln(2) and that the (maximal)\nvalue ln(2) is attained only when P (a) = 1/2. So the generics are the elements\nwith maximal entropy.\nSimilarly, if we work in the structure (M, \u03c4 ), it is easy to see that the generic\nelements of the group (M, \u03c4, \u25b3) are the transformally independent events of measure\n1/2. Let a \u2208 M . Then h(a, \u03c4 ) \u2264 ln(2) and equality holds iff a is an event of\nmeasure 1/2 which is transformally independent. So the generics of (M, \u03c4, \u25b3) are\nthe elements a \u2208 M such that the entropy of \u03c4 with respect to a is maximal.\n7. Orthogonality and omitting types\nWe start with a definition from [21].\n7.1. Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA and let A \u2282 M be such that \u03c4 (A) = A. We say\nthat \u03c4 has completely positive entropy on A if for all finite B \u2282 A, h(\u03c4, B) > 0.\nLet M be a probability space structure and let \u03c4 be a measure preserving\naperiodic automorphism of the underlying probability space. Let A \u2282 M be\ncountable. It is shown in [16] that \u03c4 has completely positive entropy on A if\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n23\n\nand only if there is A\u2032 \u2282 A such that \u03c4 \u22121 (A\u2032 ) \u2282 A\u2032 , dcl(\u222an\u22650 \u03c4 n (A\u2032 )) \u2283 A and\n\u2229n\u22651 dcl(\u03c4 \u2212n (A\u2032 )) = {\u2205, X}.\nIt is well known (Theorem 4.37 in [21], Corollary 6.15 in [16]) that if \u03c4 has completely positive entropy on A, then A is independent from the Pinsker \u03c3-algebra of\n\u03c4 . A similar result is known about ACFA([15]), namely, that types of transformally\nindependent elements are orthogonal to types of transformally algebraic elements.\nThe combination of these two ideas suggests that types of subsets of the Pinsker\n\u03c3-algebra should be orthogonal to types of subsets where \u03c4 has completely positive\nentropy. This result will be the first aim of this section. We need the following\nnotation from [16].\n7.2. Notation. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA and let A \u2282 M . Denote by A\u2212 the set dcl(\u222ai\u22651 \u03c4 \u2212i (A)).\n7.3. Theorem. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be a \u03ba-universal domain. Let A \u2282 M be a small\nset such that \u03c4 (A) = A and suppose that \u03c4 has completely positive entropy on A.\nLet B \u2282 M be a small subset of the Pinsker \u03c3-algebra. Let \u0101 be an enumeration of\nA and b\u0304 an enumeration of B. Then tp\u03c4 (\u0101) is orthogonal to tp\u03c4 (b\u0304).\nProof. We assume that A and B are countable. Then A is \u03c4 -interdefinable with\na set A\u2032 such that \u03c4 \u22121 (A\u2032 ) \u2282 A\u2032 and \u2229n\u22651 dcl(\u03c4 \u2212n (A\u2032 )) = {\u2205, X}. Let F \u2282 M\nbe a small set which is \u03c4 -independent from A\u2032 over \u2205 and \u03c4 -independent from B\nover \u2205. Let F\u03c4 = dcl\u03c4 (F ) and \u0101\u2032 an enumeration of A\u2032 . We need to show that\n\u0101\u2032 , . . . , \u03c4 n (\u0101\u2032 ) \u2323\n| F b\u0304, . . . ., \u03c4 m (b\u0304) for any n, m < \u03c9. Replacing A\u2032 by A\u2032 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 n (A\u2032 )\n\u03c4\n\nand B by B \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 m (B), it is enough to prove that \u0101\u2032 \u2323\n| F b\u0304.\n\u03c4\nBy the finite character of non-dividing, we only need to show that for any finite\nsubsets C of A\u2032 and D of B, we have C \u2323\n| F D.\n\u03c4\nBy the additivity property of entropy, we can expand H(C \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (C) \u222a D \u222a\n* * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (D)/F\u03c4 ) in two different ways:\nH(C \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (C)/F\u03c4 ) + H(D \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (D)/F\u03c4 \u222a C \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (C)) =\n= H(D \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (D)/F\u03c4 ) + H(C \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (C)/F\u03c4 \u222a D \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c4 \u2212l (D))\nDividing by l + 1, taking limits as l goes to infinity and using Fact 6.4, we get\nH(C/F\u03c4 \u222aC \u2212 )+H(D/F\u03c4 \u222aD\u2212 \u222aC \u2212 \u222aC) = H(D/F\u03c4 \u222aD\u2212 )+H(C/F\u03c4 \u222aC \u2212 \u222aD\u222aD\u2212 )\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C.

Thus C \u2323\n| F \u222aC \u2212 D \u222a D\u2212 . The same argument holds\n\u03c4\nif we replace C by \u03c4 \u2212i (C), so we get \u03c4 \u2212i (C) \u2323\n| F \u222a(\u03c4 \u2212i (C))\u2212 D \u222a D\u2212 for all i \u2265 0.\n\u03c4\n\nBy transitivity of independence, this implies C . . . \u03c4 \u2212i (C) \u2323\n| F\n\n\u03c4 \u222a(\u03c4\n\n\u2212i (C))\u2212\n\nD \u222a D\u2212\n\nfor any i \u2265 0. Since \u2229i\u22651 dcl(\u03c4 \u2212i (A\u2032 )) = {\u2205, X}, we get C \u2323\n| F D \u222a D\u2212 as we\n\u03c4\nwanted.\n\u0003\nSince there are 2\u05d00 many non-isomorphic Bernoulli shifts (see Section 4.9 in [21]),\nall of which induce aperiodic maps on separable complete probability structures,\nthere are many non principal types over \u2205. In the rest of this section we prove\nthe stronger result that only algebraic types are principal. We start with some\ndefinitions.\n7.4. Definition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA and let B \u2282 M be such that \u03c4 (B) = B.

This is\ncalled the entropy of \u03c4 with respect to B.\n7.5. Observation. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA and let B \u2282 M be such that \u03c4 (B) = B.\n(1) Let A be a finite subalgebra of M . Then h(\u03c4, A/B) = H(A/B \u222a A\u2212 ).\n(2) Let C be a subalgebra of M such that dcl(C) = M . Then h(\u03c4 /B) =\nsup{h(\u03c4, A/B) : A is a finite subset of C}.\nProof. When B = \u2205, (1) is proved in Section 4.5 in [21] and (2) is proved in Section\n4.6 in [21]. The proofs in [21] easily generalize to give what is stated here.\n\n\u0003\n\n7.6. Proposition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be a \u03ba-universal domain and let B \u2282 M\nbe countable such that \u03c4 (B) = B. Then there is (M1 , \u03c41 ) \u2282 (M, \u03c4 ) such that\n(M1 , \u03c41 ) |= TA , B \u2282 M1 and for any finite algebra D \u2282 M1 , h(\u03c4, D/B) = 0.\nProof. Let (M0 , \u03c40 ) be the model of TA induced by an irrational rotation on the\nunit circle. Then h(\u03c4, D) = 0 for any finite subalgebra D \u2282 M0 (see Section 4.7 in\n[21]). Since (M, \u03c4 ) is \u03ba-saturated, we may assume that (M0 , \u03c40 ) is a substructure\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n25\n\nof (M, \u03c4 ) which is independent from B. Let M1 = dcl(M0 , B) and let \u03c41 be the\nrestriction of \u03c4 to M1 .\nLet B \u2032 = dcl(B). Then (B \u2032 , \u03c4 \u21beB \u2032 ) is separable and can be seen as a probability structure with an automorphism. The structure (M1 , \u03c41 ) is isomorphic to the\nproduct of the structures (M0 , \u03c40 ) and (B \u2032 , \u03c4 \u21beB \u2032 ). Since \u03c40 is an aperiodic map,\nwe get (M1 , \u03c41 ) |= TA .\nIt remains to show that for any finite algebra D \u2282 M1 , h(\u03c4, D/B) = 0. By\n7.5, it is enough to prove that for any finite algebras B0 \u2282 B and A0 \u2282 M0\u2032 ,\nh(\u03c4, B0 \u222aA0 )/B) = 0. Now, since the entropy of \u03c40 is zero, the following inequalities\n\u2212\nhold: h(\u03c4, B0 \u222a A0 /B) = H(B0 \u2228 A0 /B \u222a A\u2212\n0 ) \u2264 H(A0 /A0 ) = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\n7.7. Proposition. Let (M, \u03c4 ) |= TA be a \u03ba-universal domain and let B \u2282 M\nbe countable such that \u03c4 (B) = B. Then there is (M1 , \u03c41 ) \u2282 (M, \u03c4 ) such that\n(M1 , \u03c41 ) |= TA , B \u2282 M1 and for any finite algebra D \u2282 M , h(\u03c4, D/B) = 0 iff\nD \u2282 dcl(B).\nProof. Let (M0 , \u03c40 ) |= TA be the structure induced by a Bernoulli shift generated\nby a partition into two elements {a1 , a2 } of probability 1/2 each. Then for any\nfinite set D \u2282 M0 , h(\u03c4, D) = 0 iff D \u2282 {\u2205, X} (see Section 4.9 in [21] or [18]).\nSince (M, \u03c4 ) is \u03ba-saturated, we may assume (M0 , \u03c40 ) is a substructure of (M, \u03c4 )\nwhich is independent from B. Let B \u2032 = dcl(B). Then (B \u2032 , \u03c4 \u21beB \u2032 ) is separable.\nLet M1 = dcl(M0 , B) and let \u03c41 be the restriction of \u03c4 to M1 . Then (M1 , \u03c41 ) is\nisomorphic to the product of (M0 , \u03c40 ) and (B \u2032 , \u03c4 \u21beB \u2032 ). Since \u03c40 is an aperiodic map,\nthen (M1 , \u03c41 ) |= TA .\nLet D \u2282 M1 be a finite subalgebra and assume that h(\u03c4, D/B) = 0. We want to\nshow that D \u2282 dcl(B).\nLet A = {a1 , a2 }. Let A\u2212 = dcl(\u222ai\u22651 \u03c4 \u2212i (A)) and D\u2212 = dcl(\u222ai\u22651 \u03c4 \u2212i (D)).\nThen by the additivity property of entropy, we can show that H(A/A\u2212 \u222a B \u222a\nD \u222a D\u2212 ) + H(D/B \u222a D\u2212 ) = H(D/D\u2212 \u222a B \u222a A \u222a A\u2212 ) + H(A/B \u222a A\u2212 ). Since\nh(\u03c4, D/B) = 0, we get H(A/A\u2212 \u222a B \u222a D \u222a D\u2212 ) = H(A/B \u222a A\u2212 ). This proves\n| B\u222a(\u03c4 m (A))\u2212 D for any m \u2208\nA\u2323\n| B\u222aA\u2212 D. Exchanging A for \u03c4 m (A), we get \u03c4 m (A) \u2323\nZ.

General automorphisms\nLet (X, B, m) be a probability space, let \u03c4 be an automorphism of this space and\nlet M be the probability structure associated to (X, B, m). The aim of this section\nis to discuss T hA (M, \u03c4 ).\nLet Y be the union of the atoms from (X, B, m) and let BY be the \u03c3-algebra induced by B on Y . Then \u03c4 is an automorphism of Y that permutes each set of atoms\nhaving the same (positive) measure. First we characterize ((Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ). Assume that ((Y \u2032 , B \u2032 , m\u2032 ), \u03c4 \u2032 ) is another structure such that (events(Y \u2032 , B \u2032 , m\u2032 ), \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2261A\n(events(Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ). Then for every real number r \u2208 (0, 1], the number of atoms in\nBY with measure r (denoted by Ar ) agrees with the number of atoms of B \u2032 with measure r (denoted by A\u2032r ) and the action of \u03c4 on Ar is isomorphic to the action of \u03c4 \u2032 on\nA\u2032r . So for every r \u2208 (0, 1], (Ar , \u03c4 ) \u223c\n= (A\u2032r , \u03c4 \u2032 ). This implies (events(Y \u2032 , B \u2032 , m\u2032 ), \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u223c\n=\n(events(Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ). Thus, to characterize (events(Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ), we only need to\ndescribe the permutation that \u03c4 induces on the set of atoms of measure r for each\nr \u2208 (0, 1]. The structure (events(Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ) behaves like a finite structure in first\norder theories.\nLet Z be the atomless part of X. We can decompose Z into a disjoint union\n\u222ai\u2208N Zi , where Z0 is the set of aperiodic elements of Z and for i > 0, Zi = {x \u2208 X :\n\u03c4 i (x) = x} \\ (Z1 \u222a * * * \u222a Zi\u22121 ). The automorphism \u03c4 acts on each of the sets Zi .\nLet BZi be the \u03c3-algebra induced by B on Zi . Let Mi be the probability structure\nassociated to (Zi , BZi , m). To study the atomless part of T hA (M, \u03c4 ), it suffices to\nunderstand T hA (Mi , \u03c4 ) for i \u2208 N. The behavior of the aperiodic part T hA (M0 , \u03c4 ),\nis described by TA after rescaling m(Z0 ) to be 1.\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n27\n\n8.1. Lemma. Let ([0, 1], B, m) be the standard Lebesgue space, let n \u2208 N and let\n\u03c4 be an automorphism such that \u03c4 n+1 = id and m({x : \u03c4 j (x) = x}) = 0 for all\nj < n + 1. Then there is a set A \u2208 B such that (A, . . . , \u03c4 n (A)) forms a partition of\n[0, 1] up to measure zero.\nProof. See Lemma 1 in [9, pp. 70].\n\n\u0003\n\nWe can now show that T hA (Mi , \u03c4 ) is separably categorical for each i \u2265 1.\n8.2. Proposition. Let ([0, 1], B, m) be the standard Lebesgue space, let i \u2208 N+ and\nlet \u03c4, \u03b7 be an automorphisms such that \u03c4 i = id, \u03b7 i = id and m({x : \u03c4 j (x) = x}) = 0,\nm({x : \u03b7 j (x) = x}) = 0 for all j < i. Let N be the probability structure associated\nto ([0, 1], B, m). Then (N, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n= (N, \u03b7).\nProof. By the previous lemma, there are a \u2208 N and b \u2208 N such that (a, \u03c4 (a), . . . , \u03c4 i\u22121 (a))\nforms a partition of N and (b, \u03b7(b), . . . , \u03b7 i\u22121 (a)) forms a partition of N . Let A \u2208 B\nwith event a and let B \u2208 B with event b. There is a measure preserving automorphism : : A \u2192 B. We can extend \u03b3 by defining for x = \u03c4 i (y) \u2208 \u03c4 i (A),\n\u03b3(x) = \u03b7 i (\u03b3(y)). Then \u03b3\u03c4 = \u03b7\u03b3 on a set of measure one. This proves that\n(N, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n= (N, \u03b7).\n\n\u0003\n\n8.3. Lemma. Let ([0, 1], B, m) be the standard Lebesgue space, let n \u2208 N+ and let\n\u03c4 be an automorphism such that \u03c4 n+1 = id and m({x : \u03c4 j (x) = x}) = 0 for all\nj < n + 1. Let B1 , . . . , Bm \u2208 B. Then there is a set A \u2208 B of measure 1/(n + 1)\nsuch that (A, . . . , \u03c4 n (A)) forms a partition of [0, 1] (up to measure zero) which is\nindependent from {B1 , . . . , Bm }.\nProof. Replacing B1 , . . . , Bm by the atoms in the algebra generated by {\u03c4 i (Bj ) :\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m}, we may assume that \u03c4 acts on the set {B1 , . . . , Bm }.\nIf \u03c4 (Bi ) = Bi , by Lemma 8.1, we can find Ai \u2208 B such that Ai \u2282 Bi , and\n(Ai , . . . , \u03b7 n (Ai )) forms a partition of Bi . If \u03c4 acts transitively on Bi1 , . . . , Bik ,\njust repeat the argument from [9, pp 70] starting with Bi1 instead of E1 . From the\nsets {Ai : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m} we can construct A.\nNow we prove that T hA (Mi , \u03c4 ) has quantifier elimination for each i \u2265 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C. Ward Henson\n\n28\n\n8.4. Lemma. Let ([0, 1], B, m) be the standard atomless Lebesgue space and let M\nbe the probability structure associate to it. Let \u03b71 , \u03b72 be cycles of period n + 1 on\n \u0304 . . . , \u03b7 n (d)).\n \u0304 Then there\nM . Let b\u0304, d \u0304 \u2208 M m be such that qf tp(b\u0304, . . . , \u03b71n (b\u0304)) = qf tp(d,\n2\n \u0304\nis an automorphism \u03b3 of M such that \u03b3\u03b71 = \u03b72 \u03b3 and \u03b3(b\u0304) = (d).\nProof. By the previous lemma we can find a \u2208 M such that (a, \u03b71 (a), . . . , \u03b71n (a)) is\na partition of M which is independent from {b\u0304, . . . , \u03b71n (b\u0304)}.\nSimilarly there is c \u2208 M such that (c, \u03b72 (c), . . . , \u03b72n (c)) is a partition of M which\n \u0304 . . . , \u03b7 n (d)}.\n \u0304\nis independent from {d,\n2\n \u0304 . . . , \u03b7 n (d),\n \u0304 c, . . . , \u03b7 n (c)).\nIn particular we obtain that qf tp(b\u0304, . . . , \u03b71n (b\u0304), a, . . . , \u03b71n (a)) = qf tp(d,\n2\n2\nLet b\u0304\u2032 = (b\u20321 , . . . , b\u2032k ) be the atoms of the algebra generated by {b\u0304, . . . , \u03b71n (b\u0304)} and\n \u0304 . . . , \u03b7 n (d)}.\n \u0304\nlet d \u0304\u2032 = (d\u20321 , . . . , d\u2032k ) be the atoms of the algebra generated by {d,\nWe\n2\nmay choose enumerations such that qf tp(b\u0304\u2032 , a, . . . , \u03b71n (a)) = qf tp(d \u0304\u2032 , c, . . . , \u03b71n (c)).\nIt suffices to prove the lemma for b\u0304\u2032 and d \u0304\u2032 .\nLet A, B1\u2032 , . . . , Bk\u2032 , C, D1\u2032 , . . . , Dk\u2032 be sets in B giving rise to the collection of events\na, b\u20321 , . . . , b\u2032k , c1 , . . . , d\u2032k . Then m(A \u2229 Bi\u2032 ) = m(C \u2229 Di\u2032 ) for i \u2264 k. Let \u03b3 : A \u2192 C\nbe an isomorphism sending A \u2229 Bi to C \u2229 Di (up to measure zero) for i \u2264 k.\nLet x \u2208 \u03b71l (A). Then there is y \u2208 A such that \u03b71l (y) = x. Extend \u03b3 by defining\n\u03b3(x) = \u03b72l (\u03b3(y)). Note that \u03b71 (b\u2032i ) = d\u2032i for i \u2264 k and \u03b3\u03b71 = \u03b72 \u03b3.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Lemma 8.4, T hA (Mi , \u03c4 ) has quantifier elimination and thus it is model complete. Note that T hA (M, \u03c4 ) need not have quantifier elimination. We first need to\nsplit (M, \u03c4 ) into its atomic part and the (Mi , \u03c4 ) in order to get quantifier elimination.\nSince T is stable, so are the theories T hA (Mi , \u03c4 ) for i > 0 and T hA (M, \u03c4 ).\nLet (M, \u03c4 ) \u0016A (N, \u03c4 ) and let {zi : i \u2208 N} be the events corresponding to the\nmeasurable sets {Zi : i \u2208 N} described above. Let i \u2208 N+ and assume that\nm(zi ) > 0. Let a \u2208 N be such that a \u2282 zi and m(a) > 0. Then there is b \u2282 a such\nthat m(b) > 0, \u03c4 i (b) = b and \u03c4 j (b) 6= b for all j < i. This shows the decomposition\n{zi : i \u2208 N} is preserved in elementary superstructures.\nLet (X \u2032 , B \u2032 , m\u2032 ) be a probability space, let \u03c4 \u2032 be a measure preserving automorphism of this space and let M \u2032 be the probability structure associated to the\nprobability space. Follow the notation above and denote by Y \u2032 the union of the\natoms from M \u2032 and zi\u2032 the event associated to the set formed by the elements\n\n\fProbability Spaces with an Automorphism\n\n29\n\nwith period i. Then (M \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2261A (M, \u03c4 ) iff ((Y \u2032 , BY\u2032 , m\u2032 ), \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u223c\n= ((Y, BY , m), \u03c4 ) and\nm(zi\u2032 ) = m(zi ) for i \u2208 N. We conclude that the theory T hA (M, \u03c4 ) can be described\nin terms of T hA (MY , \u03c4 ) and the sequence (m(Mi ) : i < \u03c9).\nIn conclusion, we give some open questions related to the subject of this paper.\nAs background to the first questions, note that for probability structures (i.e.,\nwithout automorphism), Lemma 3.8 gives a very nice, explicit formula for the d\ndistance between types over a set of parameters C. This is a basis for a full analysis\nof stability of these structures. For example, see Remark 3.13.\n8.5. Question. Can we characterize the d-metric in type spaces of TA ? That is,\ncan we find a description of d in the spirit of Lemma 3.8?\n8.6. Question. What is the density character of the space of \u03c4 -types over a given\nset of parameters C, with respect to the d-metric? (See [11, 12] for a proof that TA\nis stable with respect to the d-metric, since it is stable with respect to the minimal\nuniform structure on types. This gives a partial answer to this question.)\n8.7. Question. Is TA superstable with respect to the d-metric? (See Remark 3.13.)\nIn [4] the model theory of the Banach lattices Lp (\u03bc) is studied, for each p \u2208\n[1, \u221e). Each of these theories interprets the theory T of probability structures (for\nany positive Lp -function f of norm 1, consider the set of components of f equipped\nwith the pth power of the norm as probability measure). So, in a certain sense\nthe results in [4] extend those in [2] and in section 3 of this paper. Furthermore,\nautomorphisms of Lp (\u03bc)-spaces are well understood from the functional analysis\npoint of view.\n8.8. Question. Is there a model companion for the positive theory of the Banach\nlattices Lp (\u03bc) expanded by an automorphism?\nReferences\n[1] Itay Ben-Yaacov, Positive model theory and compact abstract theories, Journal of Mathematical Logic 3, 2003, 85\u2013118.\n[2] Itay Ben-Yaacov, Schroedinger's cat, preprint 2002.\n[3] Itay Ben-Yaacov, Simplicity in compact abstract theories, Journal of Mathematical Logic 3,\n2003, 163\u2013191.\n\n\fAlexander Berenstein and C.
