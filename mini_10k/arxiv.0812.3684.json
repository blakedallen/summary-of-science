Introduction\nA beautiful correspondence brought to light by Atiyah [A] ties together the\ngeometry of bundles on families of rational curves, parametrised by a variety V , to\nmaps of V into a certain flag manifold of a loop group. The correspondence is quite\nsimple: one associates to a bundle a suitable transition function which is defined\nover a circle. This correspondence has been exploited repeatedly, for example in\ndescribing moduli of instantons: [Ki2, BHMM2, Gra, HM, Ti1, Ti2].\nThis article revisits this correspondence, with an eye to the full range of flag\nmanifolds of the loop group. Many of the features brought to light in the more\nrestricted case considered above also hold here: for example, when the variety V is\na curve, the spaces of maps admit a \"poles and principal parts\" description. This\nallows a proof of topological stability, that is, that the homotopy groups stabilise\nas one takes the degrees of the maps to infinity. We treat here the case of V = P1 .\nWhile these spaces of maps are of interest in their own right, they are also moduli\nspaces: for a suitably chosen maximal parabolic, one has moduli spaces of instantons\non S 4 , and this correspondence was the one exploited in [Ki2, BHMM2, Ti1, Ti2]\nto give the proof of the Atiyah-Jones conjecture on topological stability.

Below, we get topological stability theorems for\nall instanton moduli space on S 4 , previous work having just considered classical\ngroups, as well as for the more general caloron moduli.\nAnother aspect that we consider is the role that outer automorphisms play in this\npicture; we find that these automorphisms correspond to Hecke transforms. They\nwill define isomorphisms, some of them not obvious, between various instanton,\ncaloron and monopole moduli.\n2. Parabolic subgroups of loop groups\nLet K be a compact semi-simple Lie group with complexification G. Choose a\nmaximal torus T \u2282 K. Denote the Lie algebras of K, G and T by k, g and t. Let\nh = tc which is a Cartan subalgebra of g. Denote by R(g) \u2282 h\u2217 the set of roots and\nchoose a base of simple roots \u25b3(g). As usual define a root to be positive if it is a\npositive linear combination of simple roots. If \u03b1 is a root denote the corresponding\nroot space by g\u03b1 . The Borel subalgebra b is defined by\nb = h \u2295\u03b1>0 g\u03b1\nand the opposite Borel is defined by\nb\u2212 = h \u2295\u03b1<0 g\u03b1 .\nSimilarly define\nn = \u2295\u03b1>0 g\u03b1\nand its opposite by\nn\u2212 = \u2295\u03b1<0 g\u03b1 .\nNote that we have\ng = n\u2212 \u2295 h \u2295 n.\nIf \u25b30 \u2282 \u25b3(g) we define a parabolic subalgebra p(\u25b30 ) as the Lie subalgebra of g\ngenerated by\nM\nb\u2295\ng\u2212\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\u2208\u25b30\n\nThis in fact establishes a bijective correspondence between subalgebras containing\nb and subsets of \u25b3(g). Notice that p(\u2205) = b and p(\u25b3(g)) = g.\nTo extend this to loop algebras it is useful to take a different, but equivalent\napproach. Let RZ (g) \u2282 h\u2217 be the Z-module generated by the roots. In particular if\n\u25b3(g) is a base for R(g) then RZ (g) is a free Z-module over \u25b3(g). Define a function\n\u03c7 : RZ (g) \u2192 Z by assigning a number which is one or zero to each positive simple\nroot and extending it to be Z-linear. For any \u03b1 \u2208 RZ (g) let us define g\u03b1 to be the\ncorresponding weight space. So if \u03b1 = 0 then g0 = h, if \u03b1 \u2208 R(g) then g\u03b1 is the\ncorresponding root space and otherwise g\u03b1 is zero. Noting that [g\u03b1 , g\u03b2 ] \u2282 g\u03b1+\u03b2 we\nsee that\nM\ng\u03b1\n\u03c7(\u03b1)\u22650\n\nis the parabolic subalgebra corresponding to\n\n\u25b3\u03c7 = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u25b3(g) | \u03c7(\u03b1) = 0}.\nConsider the loop algebra\nLk = R[z, z \u22121 ] \u2297R k\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n3\n\nwith the pointwise bracket as well as its complexification Lg = C[z, z \u22121] \u2297C g. It\nis convenient to consider the semi-direct product L\u0303g = Lg \u2295 Cd whose elements we\nwrite as X(z) + xd. This has bracket:\n[X(z) + xid, Y (z) + yid] = [X(z), Y (z)] + xY \u2032 (z) \u2212 yX \u2032 (z)\nwhere X \u2032 (z) is the derivative with respect to z. We define \u03b4 : h \u2295 Cd \u2192 C by\n\u03b4(X(z) + xd) = x and extend any linear function on h to h \u2295 Cd by making it zero\non d. The root space decomposition is\nL\u0303g = (\u2295(n,\u03b1)\u2208Z\u00d7R(g) z n \u2297 g\u03b1 ) \u2295 h \u2295 idC.\nand the roots of L\u0303g are\nR(L\u0303g) = Z \u00d7 R(g) = {n\u03b4 + \u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 R(g), n \u2208 Z} \u2282 (h \u2295 Cd)\u2217\nNotice that we can write\nL\u0303g =\n\nM\n\nz n g \u2295 n\u2212 \u2295 h \u2295 idC \u2295 n \u2295\n\nn<0\n\nM\n\nz n g.\n\nn>0\n\nWe say that a root n\u03b4 + \u03b1 is positive if n > 0 or n = 0 and \u03b1 > 0.\nIf \u25b3(g) = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r } consider the positive roots \u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212\u03b8, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1r ; here\n\u03b8 is the highest root of g. These are simple roots for this definition of positive. To\nsee this note that\nn\u03b4 + \u03b1 = n(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) + (\u03b8 + \u03b1) + (n \u2212 1)\u03b8.\nIf n > 0 then this is a non-negative linear combination of the simple roots. If n = 0\nthen \u03b1 > 0 so it is also a non-negative combination of simple roots. So we choose\nthe base of simple roots\n\u25b3(L\u0303g) = {\u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1r }\nThe Borel subalgebra formed by taking non-negative root spaces is\nM\ndC \u2295 b \u2295\nz ng\nn>0\n\nwhich has the geometric interpretation as loops X(z) such that X(0) \u2208 b.\nTo understand the parabolic subalgebras note that we have \u25b3(L\u0303g) = {\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8} \u222a\n\u25b3(g) as simple roots of the loop algebra.

Thus, if \u03c7 is\nnon zero, \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) = 1 and so the expression is still negative. We conclude that the\nexpression must be negative for n \u2264 \u22122.\nNext consider n = \u22121 so\n\u03c7(n\u03b4 + \u03b1) = \u2212\u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) + (\u03c7(\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03b8)).\nIt is only possible for this to be non-negative if \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) = 0 and \u03c7(\u03b1) = \u03c7(\u03b8).\nDefine\nM\ng\u03b1 .\nq\u03c7 =\n\u03c7(\u03b1)=\u03c7(\u03b4)\n\nNotice that if \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) = 1 then q\u03c7 = 0.\nIf n = 0 we have\n\u03c7(n\u03b4 + \u03b1) = \u03c7(\u03b1)\nand thus we are interested in\nM\ng\u03b1 .\n\u03c7(\u03b1)\u22650\n\nIf we denote \u03c7 restricted to RZ (g) also by \u03c7 then we have a parabolic subalgebra\nM\ng\u03b1 .\np(\u25b3\u03c7 (g)) =\n\u03c7(\u03b1)\u22650\n\nFinally if n \u2265 1 then we have\n\n\u03c7(n\u03b4 + \u03b1) \u2265 \u03c7(\u03b4 + \u03b1) = \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03c7(\u03b8 + \u03b1) \u2265 0.\nWe conclude that \u03c7 determines the parabolic subalgebra\nM\n1\np(\u25b3\u03c7 (L\u0303g)) = q\u03c7 \u2295 p(\u25b3\u03c7 (g)) \u2295 h \u2295 Cd \u2295\nz n g.\nz\nn>0\n\nNotice that there are two distinct cases:\n(i) If \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) = 1 then this parabolic subalgebra is\nM\np(\u25b3\u03c7 (g)) \u2295 h \u2295 Cd \u2295\nz n g.\nn>0\n\nwhich has the geometric interpretation as loops X(z) such that X(0) \u2208\np(\u25b3\u03c7 (g)). We call such parabolics standard and we call p(\u25b3\u03c7 (g)) the\nrelated finite parabolic.\n(ii) If \u03c7(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8) = 0 then q\u03c7 6= 0. We call such parabolics exotic.\nTo understand the relationship between these two types of parabolic subalgebras\nit is useful to consider the (extended) Dynkin diagram of the loop algebra. This is\nthe diagram constructed from the Dynkin diagram of the finite algebra by adding\nthe simple root \u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8 according to the usual rules for forming a Dynkin\ndiagram. Parabolics can be read off from a Dynkin diagram by using the notation\nof [BE]. Each parabolic is determined by placing a cross through every node \u03b1i\nof the Dynkin diagram for which \u03c7(\u03b1i ) = 1. So for example the Borel subalgebra\nhas a cross through every node and a maximal parabolic subalgebra has a cross\nthrough only one node. A parabolic is standard if the extended Dynkin diagram\nhas a cross through the node \u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8 and the related finite parabolic is the\nparabolic determined by the corresponding finite Dynkin diagram. A parabolic is\nexotic if the node \u03b10 does not have a cross through it.\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n5\n\nAs in the finite case automorphisms of the extended Dynkin diagram induce outer\nautomorphisms of the loop algebra. These can be chosen so that they fix the Cartan\nsubalgebra and act on the simple roots according to the original automorphism.\nThey then act on the parabolic subalgebras by permuting the crossings of the\nnodes. Inspection of the extended Dynkin diagrams below shows that the action\ncan sometimes interchange standard and exotic parabolics.\n2.1. An example. Let G = SL(2, C) and likewise g = sl(2, C).

An alternative way to approach the example. A more symmetric way of\nunderstanding what is going on is to represent the loop algebra or group in terms of\ninfinite dimensional matrices. For convenience we consider polynomial loops. Let\nLC2 = C[z \u22121 , z] \u2297 C2 . Define an infinite basis of this by\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n1 i\n0 i\ne2i =\nz\nand\ne2i+1 =\nz\n0\n1\nfor i \u2208 Z.

This matrix shares with the general element of the loop algebra and\nindeed the group the property that Mi,k = Mi+2,k+2 . We have a non-trivial outer\nautomorphism of Lsl(2, C) which corresponds to Mi,k 7\u2192 Mi+1,k+1 . This is the flip\ndescribed in the previous section.\nThe Borel subalgebra defined above maps to the upper triangular matrices. The\nstandard parabolic and the exotic parabolic map to the block upper triangular\nmatrices, periodic with two by two blocks. Flipping interchanges the standard and\nthe exotic parabolic and corresponds to moving everying along the diagonal by one\nentry.\nMore generally consider the case of polynomial loops in the general linear algebra\ngl(n, C). As above we can think of the matrix representation of such a loop as an\ninfinite dimensional matrix M = (Mk,l )k,l\u2208Z indexed by k, l \u2208 Z. For such a matrix\nM define M[i,j] to be the n \u00d7 n matrix which is the (i, j)th block\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nMni+1,nj+1 Mni+1,nj+2 * * * Mni+1,nj+n\n\uf8ef Mni+2,nj+1 Mni+2,nj+2 * * * Mni+2,nj+n \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nM[ij] = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa.\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nMni+n,nj+2 * * * Mni+n,nj+n\nP\nAs in the 2 \u00d7 2 case the loop algebra element j Mj z j is represented by the infinite\nmatrix M with M[i,j] = Mi\u2212j for all i, j \u2208 Z. These matrices M are obviously\ninvariant under Mi,j 7\u2192 Mi+n,j+n . Notice that if we take loops in a Lie subalgebra\nL \u2282 gl(n, C) then for every i, j \u2208 Z we have M[i,j] \u2208 L.\nFor the particular classical algebras and groups, one has:\nMni+n,nj+1\n\n2.3. The special linear algebra sl(n, C). .\nFrom the infinite dimensional matrix point of view, the loop algebra consists of\nmatrices periodic under the shift of indices (i, j) 7\u2192 (i + n, j + n); simple root spaces\nfor the i-th root correspond to above diagonal matrix entries Mkn+i,kn+i+1 ; the\nopposite root spaces to the entries below the diagonal Mkn+i+1,kn+i . The parabolics, both standard and exotic, correspond to block upper triangular matrices, where\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n7\n\n\u03b10\n\u275dP\n\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\u270f\n\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\n\u270f\n\u275d\u270f\n\u275d\nq q q\n\u275d PP \u275d\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b1l\u22121 \u03b1l\nFigure 1. The Dynkin diagram of the loop algebra of sl(n, C)\nagain the pattern of blocks along the diagonal is n-periodic; the standard parabolics\ncorrespond to the case for which the entry (1, 0) does not belong to the blocks.\nThere is an outer automorphism, this time of order n, given by conjugation by:\n\n(2.1)\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\uf8ef n1\n\uf8efz\n\uf8ef\nA(z) = \uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0. . .\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\nzn\n...\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n...\n0\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n0\n0\n0\n...\n1\n... zn\n\nz\n\n\u2212n+1\nn\n\n0\n0\n...\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nIt permutes the simple roots for sl(n, C) and the extra root \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8 cyclically. In\nthe infinite matrix picture, the automorphism corresponds to the shift of indices\n(i, j) 7\u2192 (i + 1, j + 1), and so permutes the parabolic subalgebras. In particular, any\nparabolic can be mapped to one of the standard ones. This automorphism rotates\nthe Dynkin diagram in Figure 1.\nNotice that there is a reflection automorphism of the Dynkin diagram in Figure\n1 which is not a composition of rotations. This leaves \u03b10 fixed and swaps \u03b11 7\u2192 \u03b1l ,\n\u03b12 7\u2192 \u03b1l\u22121 , . . . and is induced by the corresponding automorphism of the Dynkin\ndiagram of sl(n, C).\n2n\n2.4. Orthogonal\nP2n algebras in even dimension. Let us define our pairing on C\nby he, f i = i=1 ei f2n+1\u2212i . Matrices in the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group\nthen satisfy the symmetry relation:\n\n(2.2)\n\nMi,j = \u2212M2n+1\u2212j,2n+1\u2212i ,\n\nand the Borel subalgebra is the subalgebra of upper triangular matrices. Elements\nof the loop algebra, represented as infinite matrices, then have an invariance under\nan infinite dihedral group, acting along the diagonal, generated by the extension\nof the symmetry in the matrices for so(2n, C) and the translational symmetry\nMi,j = Mi+2n,j+2n . The parabolic subalgebras are the given by subspaces of block\nupper triangular matrices, where the pattern of blocks is 2n-periodic along the\ndiagonal, and addition is invariant under the reflection 2.2.\nThere is an outer automorphism, given by conjugation by\n#\n\"\n1\n0\nz2I\n.\n(2.3)\n\u22121\n0\nz 2 I\nIts effect on the infinite matrix is the translation (i, j) 7\u2192 (i + n, j + n).

This is of course represented by conjugation by an appropriate\ninfinite periodic permutation matrix. This fixes all simple roots except \u03b1n\u22121 and\n\u03b1n which it swaps. Combining this with the previous automorphism we can construct an automorphism which leaves the extended Dynkin diagram fixed except\nfor swapping \u03b10 and \u03b11 . This corresponds to conjugation by the infinite periodic\npermuation matrix arising from (2.4) shifted by n. Together these generate the\nwhole automorphism group which is D4 .\nNotice that the automorphisms fix the subset of simple roots {\u03b10 , \u03b11 , \u03b1n\u22121 , \u03b1n }\nand act transitively on it. It follows that the only parabolics p(\u25b3\u03c7 ) which can be\nmapped by an automorphism to a standard parabolic (i.e \u03b10 \u2208\n/ \u25b3\u03c7 ) are precisely\nthose for which \u25b3\u03c7 does not contain the full set {\u03b10 , \u03b11 , \u03b1n\u22121 , \u03b1n }.\n2.5. Orthogonal algebras in odd dimension. Let us again define our pairing\nP2n\non C2n+1 by he, f i = i=1 ei f2n+2\u2212i . Matrices in the Lie algebra of the orthogonal\ngroup then again satisfy the symmetry relation Mi,j = \u2212M2n+2\u2212j,2n+2\u2212i , and the\nBorel subalgebra is the subalgebra of upper triangular matrices.\nGoing to the loop algebra, and again representing the elements as infinite matrices, we have that the matrices are in a similar way to even dimensions invariant\nunder the action of an infinite dihedral group acting along the diagonal. Again,\nthe parabolics are given by block upper triangular matrices, where the pattern of\nblocks is invariant under the action of the dihedral group.\nAs we can see from the extended Dynkin diagram in Figure 3 there is only one\nouter automorphism, there is no translation by a half period along the diagonal,\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n\u03b10 \u275d\n\u274d\u274d\n\u274d\u275d\n\u271f\u03b1\n\u271f\n2\n\u03b11 \u275d\u271f\n\nq q q\n\n\u275d i\n\u03b1l\u22121\n\n9\n\n\u275d\n\u03b1n\n\nFigure 3.

The outer automorphism is given by permuting\nthe entries Mk(2n+1),j and Mk(2n+1)+1,j , then permuting the entries Mi,k(2n+1) and\nMi,k(2n+1)+1 . Again, it is given by conjugation by a suitable (infinite, periodic)\npermutation matrix.\n2.6. Symplectic algebras. Let us define our pairing on C2n by\nn\nX\nhe, f i =\nei f2n+1\u2212i \u2212 fi e2n+1\u2212i .\ni=1\n\nWe decompose matrices M in the Lie algebra of the symplectic group in n \u00d7 n\nblocks as\n\u0014 1\n\u0015\nM\nM2\n(2.5)\n.\nM3 M4\n\n1\n4\n2\nThe blocks then satisfy the symmetry relations Mi,j\n= \u2212Mn+1\u2212j,n+1\u2212i\n, Mi,j\n=\n2\n3\n3\nMn+1\u2212j,n+1\u2212i , Mi,j = Mn+1\u2212j,n+1\u2212i . Translating into infinite matrix terms for the\nloop algebras, we get for the loop algebra of the symplectic group matrices invariant\nagain under an infinite dihedral group acting along the diagonal, but this time with\ndifferent changes of signs associated to the reflections.\nAgain considering the Dynkin diagram in Figure 4 we see that there is only one\nouter automorphism, associated to the translation (i, j) 7\u2192 (i + n, j + n).\n\n3. Flag manifolds of a loop group, and link to bundles\nWe thus have parabolic subalgebras pLG, and hence subgroups PLG , associated\nto each loop group LG. We now turn to the corresponding homogeneous spaces.\nFollowing Atiyah, we associate to any element of LG a G-bundle over the Riemann sphere, simply by thinking of the loop as a transition function defined along\nthe equator over the Riemann sphere. Of course, bundles are in bijective correspondence with the double cosets LG\u2212 \\LG/LG+ , where LG+ , LG\u2212 are the subgroups\nof loops extending holomorphically to |z| \u2264 1, |z| \u2265 1, respectively. LG+ is one of\nthe maximal parabolic subgroups discussed earlier.\n3.1. Proposition. [A] Elements of LG/LG+ are in one to one correspondence with\npairs (E, t), where E is a G-bundle on P1 and t is a trivialisation of E on the disk\n|z| \u2265 1.\n\n\f10\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nMore generally, if PLG is a standard parabolic subgroup corresponding to a parabolic PG of G, elements of LG/PLG are in one to one correspondence with triples\n(E, t, R), where E is a G-bundle on P1 , t is a trivialisation of E on the disk |z| \u2265 1,\nand R is a reduction to PG over z = 0.\nThe case of the \"exotic\" parabolics is a little bit harder to see. Fortunately, there\nare the outer automorphisms that allow us to move them to standard parabolics,\nessentially by Hecke transforms of the associated vector bundles, as we shall see\nbelow.\nOne can of course consider not only individual points, but families, in particular\nthose parametrised by a Riemann surface \u03a3.\n3.2. Proposition. [A] Elements of Hol(\u03a3, LG/LG+ ) are in one to one correspondence with pairs (E, t), where E is a G-bundle on \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 and t is a trivialisation of\nE on the product of \u03a3 and the disk |z| \u2265 1. One can add in a basing condition, so\nthat for Hol\u2217 (\u03a3, LG/LG+ ) one asks over the basepoint of \u03a3 that the trivialisation\nof the bundle extend to the whole P1 lying over the basepoint.\nMore generally, if PLG is a standard parabolic subgroup corresponding to a parabolic PG of G, elements of Hol(\u03a3, LG/PLG ) are in one to one correspondence with\ntriples (E, t, R), where E is a G-bundle on \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 , t is a trivialisation of E on the\nproduct of \u03a3 and the disk |z| \u2265 1, and R is a reduction to PG over z = 0.\nIn particular, If \u03a3 is P1 , a trivialisation of a bundle on P1 \u00d7 {z = \u221e} \u222a {x =\n\u221e} \u00d7 P1 extends automatically to some neighbourhood of z = \u221e, and, using the\nC\u2217 action, one can pull back to a bundle trivialised over |z| \u2265 1. Thus:\n3.3. Proposition. [A] The space Hol\u2217 (P1 , LG/LG+ ) of based maps is homotopy\nequivalent to the space of pairs (E, t), where E is a G-bundle on P1 \u00d7 P1 and t is\na trivialisation of E on P1 \u00d7 {z = \u221e} \u222a {x = \u221e} \u00d7 P1 . Over compact families,\nthis equivalence is realised by a biholomorphic map.\nMore generally, if PLG is a standard parabolic subgroup corresponding to a parabolic PG of G, the space Hol\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG) of based maps is homotopy equivalent\nto the space of triples (E, t, R), where E is a G-bundle on \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 , t is a trivialisation of E on P1 \u00d7 {z = \u221e} \u222a {x = \u221e} \u00d7 P1 , and R is a reduction to PG over\nz = 0.\nLet us look at some of the homogeneous spaces in turn:\n3.1. Sl(n, C) or Gl(n, C). Let us choose the standard normalisation, for which\nthe root spaces correspond to the entries in the n by n matrices. We start with an\nelement of LGl(n, C)/BLGl(n,C) , the full flag space, and see what happens when\nwe project to LGl(n, C)/PLGl(n,C) . As noted, an element of LGl(n, C)/BLGl(n,C)\ngives us a rank n vector bundle E over the Riemann sphere, with degree, let us say,\nzero, along with a framing near infinity , and a flag in the fiber E0 over the origin:\nE01 \u2282 E02 \u2282 . . . E0n = E0 , where the superscript indicates the dimension. This flag\nreduces the structure group to BGl(n,C) over the origin, and reduces the group of\ncompatible bases near the origin to BLGl(n,C) .\nThe essential point here is that such a bundle with flag corresponds not just to\none bundle, but to a whole sequence. Indeed, let us define the sheaves of sections\nof E, holomorphic away from the origin, meromorphic near the origin:\n(3.4)\n\nE i,j = {s|order(s) = \u2212i, leading term \u2208 E0j }.\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n11\n\nOne has E = E 0,n . These sheaves are torsion free and thus correspond to bundles.\nAs a bundle, the degree of E i,j is n(i \u2212 1) + j. One has the nested sequence\n(3.5)\n\n. . . \u2282 E \u22121,1 \u2282 E \u22121,2 \u2282 . . . E \u22121,n \u2282 E 0,1 \u2282 E 0,2 \u2282 . . . E 0,n \u2282 E 1,1 . . .\n\nNear the origin, z k E i,j = E i\u2212k,j . Each of these bundles comes equipped by a\nflag at the origin, defined in essence by the n \u2212 1 sheaves which precede it in\nthe sequence. This way of looking at things puts the bundle E and all its Hecke\ntransforms on the same footing. With this, projection to LGl(n, C)/PLGl(n,C) for\none of the standard parabolics amounts to deleting a certain subset E 0,js , js \u2208 \u22060 of\nE 0,1 , E 0,2 . . . E 0,n\u22121 from the sequence of inclusions, as well as all their \"translates\"\nE i,js in the first index. Considering the \"exotic\" parabolics also simply allows one\n \u0303 0 of\nto delete the E i,n as well. Thus, since parabolics correspond to a subset \u2206\n{1, 2, . . . , n}\n \u0303 0 .

Near the origin, the sheaf E i,j\nthought of as a bundle, has a basis z \u2212i e1 , .., z \u2212i ej , z \u2212i+1 ej+1 , . . . z \u2212i+1 e2n , and so,\na quadratic form\n(3.10)\n\nfor j \u2264 n :\n\nj\nX\n\nz \u22122i+1 ai a2n+1\u2212i +\n\n(3.11)\n\nfor n < j \u2264 2n,\n\ni=1\n\ni,n\n\ni,2n\n\nz \u22122i+2 ai a2n+1\u2212i\n\ni=j+1\n\ni=1\n\nj\u2212n\nX\n\nn\nX\n\nz \u22122i ai a2n+1\u2212i +\n\nn\nX\n\nz \u22122i+1 ai a2n+1\u2212i .\n\ni=j\u2212n+1\n\nFor the sheaves E , E\n, i \u2208 Z, alternately, one can think of the fibers as\nbeing equipped with a conformal structure, which extends in a non degenerate way\nto the origin. The sheaves again have a privileged isotropic-coisotropic flag at the\norigin, with the passage from E i,n to E i,2n exchanging isotropic and coisotropic.\nAgain, this last Hecke transform can be though of as being mediated by the outer\nautomorphism of the loop group defined by conjugating by 2.3. In terms of infinite\nmatrices, this automorphism moves us either up or down by n steps along the\ndiagonal.\nThe orthogonal groups in 2n dimensions already have an outer automorphism,\nwhich in terms of flags permutes the half-dimensional isotropic subspaces E0n,+ and\nE0n,\u2212 , and leaves the other spaces of the flag in place; this of course extends to the\nloop group. When one goes to the loop group, one acquires a similar automorphism,\npermuting Ei,2n,+ and Ei,2n,\u2212 , but leaving the other subspaces in place. These two\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n13\n\nautomorphisms, together with 2.3, generate a group of order 4, corresponding to\nthe symmetries of the extended Dynkin diagram.\nWhen one passes from the Borel to the various standard parabolics, one deletes\nas for the case of Sl(n, C) a certain number of subspaces E0jl , including possibly\nE0n,\u00b1 , of the isotropic flag at the origin, as well as their coisotropic twins (E0j )\u22a5 =\nE02n\u2212jl . In terms of the infinite sequence of sheaves, there is a corresponding infinite\nsequence of deletions; the exotic parabolics amount to including E i,2n,\u00b1 in the\npossible exclusions. It is important to note that there is some redundancy in the\nsequence 3.9; for example, E0n,+ and E0n,\u2212 together determine E0n\u22121 , E0n+1 . Thus\n \u0303 0 of\ndeletions might not actually determine a new flag manifold; however subsets \u2206\nthe simple roots do correspond to periodic deletions D0 in the sequence above.\n \u0303 0 .

Orthogonal groups in odd dimension. The odd dimensional case is in\nsome aspects similar, but in others distinct: for the group SO(2n + 1, C), one\nobtains a rank 2n + 1 bundle, trivialised as before on the disk |z| \u2265 1, and at the\norigin, equipped with an isotropic flag E01 \u2282 E02 \u2282 . . . \u2282 E0n , which extends to the\northogonal complement coisotropic flag E0n+1 = (E0n )\u22a5 \u2282 . . .

Birkhoff, Bruhat, Borel-Weil\ni) The Birkhoff and Bruhat stratifications. Just as for finite dimensional groups,\n\u2212\nwe have an action of the unipotent radical NLG\nopposite to BLG on LG/PLG ; this\naction sweeps out contractible sets \u03a3w of finite codimension, the Birkhoff strata.\nThe unipotent radical NLG of BLG , in turn, sweeps out cells Cw of finite dimension.\nThe two sets \u03a3w and Cw are transverse, and meet at a point.\nd also known as\nThe cells are indexed by elements w of the Weyl group of LG,\nthe affine Weyl group of G. It is a semi-direct product Waff = W \u00d7 \u0164 , where\nW is the Weyl group of G, and \u0164 the lattice of homomorphisms C\u2217 \u2192 T , where\nT is a maximal torus of G. It is generated by the simple root reflections \u03c3i for\ni = 0, 1, . . . , r. Again just as in the finite case we can define the length of an\nelement w \u2208 Waff , l(w), as the minimal number of simple root reflections in a\nminimal presentation of w.\nFor PLG a parabolic subgroup corresponding to a set of simple roots \u25b30 we can\ndefine the subgroup WPLG \u2282 Waff generated by the root reflections for simple roots\nin \u25b30 . This is the Weyl group of the semi-simple Levi factor of PLG . Inspection of\nthe extended Dynkin diagrams show that this is always a finite dimensional group\nand hence WPLG is finite. There is a unique element in each right coset of WPLG\nin Waff of minimal length. This defines a subset W PLG called the Hasse diagram\nof PLG . Just as in case of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras we have that\nevery w \u2208 Waff can be uniquely decomposed as w = w1 w2 with w1 \u2208 W PLG and\nw2 \u2208 WPLG and l(w) = l(w1 ) + l(w2 ). In the finite case these results are proved in\nfor example [Hum2] and the extension to the infinite, or affine, case also follows from\nthe discussions therein. If PLG is not exotic and corresponds to a finite parabolic\nQ then W PLG = W Q \u00d7 \u0164 . We need one final result which can be proved using the\nresults in [Hum2]. That is that if w \u2208 W PLG then we have\n{\u03b2 > 0 | w(\u03b2) < 0} \u2282 R(u),\nwhere R(u) are the roots of the root spaces occuring in the Lie algebra of u of the\nunipotent subalgebra of PLG .\nSince Waff is the quotient of the normaliser N (C\u2217 \u00d7 T ) of the torus C\u2217 \u00d7 T of\nL\u0303G by C\u2217 \u00d7 T , it embeds well into the quotient L\u0303G/PLG . Our contractible open\nP\nsets will then be orbits of the elements w of Waff\n.\nBefore stating the next theorem recall that we have:\nPLG = LeviLGULG ,\nBLG = T c NLG ,\nas well as an embedding (cf [PS]) dense decomposition of\n\u2212\nNLG\nBLG \u2282 LG\n\nas a dense open set.\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n15\n\n4.1. Theorem. (cf [PS], p.144. for the case when P is a Borel.)\n(i) The complex manifold LG/PLG is the union of strata \u03a3w indexed by elements\nw of W PLG .\n\u2212\n(ii) The stratum \u03a3w is the orbit of w under NLG\n, and is a locally closed contractible complex submanifold of LG/PLG of codimension l(w). It is diffeomorphic\n\u2212\n\u2212\nw\nto ULG\n= NLG\n\u2229 wULG\nw\u22121 .\n(iii) In particular \u03a31 is an open dense subset of G/PLG which is acted on freely\n\u2212\nand transitively by ULG\n.\n\u2212\n(iv) Let Aw = NLG \u2229 wULG\nw\u22121 . The orbit of w under Aw is a complex cell Cw\nof dimension l(w) which intersects \u03a3w transversally at w.\nProof. The proof proceeds as in the finite-dimensional case and the case where PLG\nis a Borel as discussed in [PS]. In particular we note from [PS] the factorisation\ntheorem:\n[\n\u2212\nNLG\nwBLG .\n(4.2)\nLG =\nw\u2208Waff\n\n(i) There is a projection map\n\nLG/BLG \u2192 LG/PLG\nwhose fibre is the finite dimensional full flag manifold of the Levi factor. The\ndecomposition 4.2 projects to a stratification of LG/PLG , and as the elements\nw, w\u2032 of Waff give the same stratum if and if only w\u2032 w\u22121 lies in WPLG , the images\nare classified by the elements of the Hasse diagram W PLG . They are also disjoint.\nNote that the orbit corresponding to w = 1 is dense.\n(ii) As the isotropy subgroup of the LG action at wPLG is wPLG w\u22121 it follows\n\u2212\n\u2212\nw\nthat the action of ULG\nw\u22121 is free, so that \u03a3w is diffeomorphic to\n\u2229 wULG\n= NLG\nw\nULG . (iii) then follows for w = 1. To get the codimension result, we note that\n\u2212\nwPLG correspond to the elements in the\nthe orbits in LG/BLG projecting to NLG\ncoset wWPLG ; of these, one is the dense orbit corresponding to w \u2208 W PLG (as w\nis of minimal length), and the codimension for this orbit below is the same as its\ncodimension above, that is l(w), by the result on [PS].\n(iv) The intersection of Cw and \u03a3w will be the orbit of wPLG under the group\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nw\nAw \u2229 ULG\nw\u22121 \u2229 NLG\n\u2229 wULG\nw\u22121 = {1}.\n= NLG \u2229 wULG\n\nA similar calculation with Lie algebras shows that the tangent spaces to Cw and\n\u03a3w at wPLG have zero intersection so the intersection is transversal, and so its\ndimension is the codimension of \u03a3w .\nTo calculate the dimension of Cw , in an alternate way, it is sufficient to calculate\n\u2212\nthe dimension of NLG \u2229 wULG\nw\u22121 or the dimension of n \u2229 wu\u2212 w\u22121 . As this can\nbe decomposed into root spaces we just need the cardinality of\n{\u03b1 > 0 | w\u22121 (\u03b1) \u2208 R(u\u2212 )}.\nIf we map \u03b1 to \u03b2 = \u2212w\u22121 (\u03b1) we see that this is the same as the cardinality of\n{\u03b2 > 0 | w(\u03b2) < 0\n\nand \u03b2 \u2208 R(u)}.\n\nBut we have already noted that for w \u2208 W PLG we have\n{\u03b2 > 0 | w(\u03b2) < 0} \u2282 R(u)\nso that\n{\u03b2 > 0 | w(\u03b2) < 0 and \u03b2 \u2208 R(u)} = {\u03b2 > 0 | w(\u03b2) < 0}\n\n\f16\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nand thus has cardinality l(w).\n\u0003\nWe remark that in the case of PLG = LG+ , the cell Cw , w \u2208 (\u0164 )+ is a versal\ndeformation space for deforming the G-bundles on P1 given by w; here (\u0164 )+ is the\npositive Weyl chamber in \u0164 .\nii) The Borel-Weil theorem. The classical Borel-Weil theorem has an analog for\nloop groups [PS]. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u039bLP be a fundamental lowest weight, with C\u03bb the\ncorresponding weight space. It is a representation of the torus T \u00d7 T in L\u0303G, and\nextends trivially to PL\u0303G . One can build the homogeneous line bundle over L\u0303G/PL\u0303G\nL\u03bb = L\u0303G \u00d7PL\u0303G C\u03bb .\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe space of sections of L\u03bb is a representation V\u03bb of L\u0303G, with lowest weight space\nC\u03bb . These basic lowest weight sections are defined by\nL\u0303G/PL\u0303G \u00d7 C\u03bb \u2192 L\u0303G \u00d7PL\u0303G C\u03bb\n(4.4)\n\n(g, e) 7\u2192 (g, \u03c0(g \u22121 * e)).\n\nHere \u03c0 : V\u03bb \u2192 C\u03bb is the projection. The basic sections in C\u03bb vanish on a divisor\nZ\u03bb . We choose a basis element v\u03bb \u2208 C\u03bb . We set n(P ) + 1 to be the cardinality of\n\u039bLP .\nThe group ULG preserves the divisors Z\u03bb ; indeed, Z\u03bb is the union of the codimension one Birkhoff stratum \u03a3w(\u03bb) , and of other, higher codimensions cells \u03a3w\u2032\ncontained in the closure of \u03a3w(\u03bb) . Here w(\u03bb) is the reflection in the simple root\nplane corresponding to \u03bb. One has a decomposition of LG/PLG as the union of the\nbig cell which is a free orbit of NLG , and the divisors Z\u03bb . We set\n(4.5)\n\nZ = \u222a\u03bb\u2208\u039bP Z\u03bb .\n\nFrom this, one has ([PS]):\n4.6. Proposition.

Based maps F from a Riemann surface \u03a3 into LG/PLG are\nclassified up to homotopy by a multi-degree k = (k1 , .., kn(P ) ) of non-negative numbers, given by the intersection multiplicity of F (\u03a3) with the Z\u03bb , or alternately, by\nthe first Chern classes of the pullbacks F \u2217 (L\u03bb ).\nLet PLG be a parabolic subgroup coresponding to a parabolic of G. Then n(P )\u22121\nof the degrees of maps to LG/PLG correspond to degrees of maps into G/P , in the\nfollowing fashion. For each wi generator of the Hasse diagram of G/P , then there\nis a corresponding divisor Zwi , the closure of Bwi P in G/P , such that the degree\n(j1 , ..., jn(P )\u22121 ) of a map of a Riemann surface into counts the intersection number\nof the image with the divisors (Zw1 , ..., Zwn(P )\u22121 ). Corresponding to these, the\ndegrees (k1 , .., kn(P )\u22121 ) of a based map of the Riemann surface into can be defined\nas follows: a based map from \u03a3 into LG/PLG corresponds to a holomorphic bundle\non \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 , trivialised on \u03a3 \u00d7 {|z| > 1} \u222a {x = \u221e} \u00d7 P1 , and with a P -flag F 0 along\nz = 0. The degree ki counts with multiplicity the number of lines {x} \u00d7 P1 over\nwhich there are sections of the associated G/P -bundle taking F 0 as value at z = 0\nand lying in Zwi at z = \u221e. The final degree kn(P ) is simply the degree (second\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n17\n\nChern class) of the bundle; It counts, again with suitable multiplicities, the number\nof lines in the ruling over which the bundle is non-trivial.\nThus, for example, taking G = Sl(n, C) and PLG = BSl(n,C) , a holomorphic\nmap corresponds to a holomorphic vector bundle E on \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 with trivial volume\nform, equipped with a flag E01 \u2282 E02 \u2282 * * * \u2282 E0n = E0 over z = 0, and, because it is\n1\n2\nn\ntrivialised at z = \u221e a (transverse) flag E\u221e\n\u2282 E\u221e\n\u2282 * * * \u2282 E\u221e\n= E\u221e over z = \u221e.\nThe degree ki counts the number of lines in the ruling such that E has a section\nn\u2212i\nover that line lying in E0i at z = 0 and E\u221e\nat z = \u221e. More properly, one had not\ni,j\nonly a bundle E, but a sequence E ( 3.4); one can consider the subsheaf \u00ca 0,j of\nn\u2212j\nE 0,j consisting of sections taking value at z = \u221e in the subspace E\u221e\n.

Principal parts and deformation theory\ni) The sheaf of principal parts. The article [BHMM1], following on previous work\n[Se, Ki1, Gu2], studies the spaces of maps from the Riemann sphere into the finite\ndimensional flag manifolds; the main conceptual tool for [BHMM1] is an idea of\n[Gra], that of the principal part of a holomorphic map into a flag manifold. Using\nthis, it was proven in [BHMM1] that the homotopy type of the space of holomorphic\nmaps into the flag manifold stabilises to that of the continuous maps as one increases\nthe degree. The same idea can be used to extend the result from maps to flag\nmanifolds to the more general case of maps to equivariant compactifications of a\nsolvable Lie group in [BHM]; this general case covers, for example, toric varieties,\nas well as certain spherical varieties.\nWe are now interested in maps from a Riemann surface \u03a3 into one of the flag\nmanifolds of a loop group. This infinite dimensional case was in fact the prime\nsubject of Gravesen's original article. Just as for finite dimensional groups, we\ncan consider the flag manifold LG/PLG as \"adding an infinity\" to the contractible\ngroup NLG . While we cannot speak of compactification, it is very much as if there\nwas a compactification when one is studying rational maps.\nJust as in [Gra, HuM, BHMM1] we define a \"sheaf of principal parts\" over a\nRiemann surface \u03a3 of maps into LG/PLG . We proceed by analogy with maps into\nP1 , the compactification of C. These can be thought of as meromorphic maps into\nC; the principal part of the map at a pole is obtained by quotienting the map by\nthe additive action of holomorphic maps into C. In the same vein, one thinks of\nmaps into LG/PLG as meromorphic maps into NLG ; the principal part is obtained\nby quotienting by the action of holomorphic maps into NLG . One thus defines a\npresheaf, by setting, for each open set V ,\n(5.1)\n\nPr(V ) = Hol(V, LG/PLG )/Hol(V, NLG).\n\n\f18\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nThis map equips the space of principal parts on V with the quotient topology. Note\nthat because the action is free and transitive over the big open cell in LG/PLG ,\nthere is only one principal part (the trivial part) associated to maps with values in\nthis cell. Sections of the sheaf of principal parts resemble sections of the sheaf of\ndivisors, in that sections are trivial over a Zariski open set. As for divisors, this\nallows us to add two sections with disjoint support. Choosing a base point in the\nbig cell allows us to think of the sheaf of principal parts as being defined by an\nexact sequence (of pointed sets)\n(5.2)\n\n0 \u2192 Hol(V, NLG ) \u2192 Hol(V, LG/PLG ) \u2192 Pr(V ) \u2192 0.\n\nSince the action of NLG \u2282 ULG fixes the holomorphic sections v\u03bb of the homogeneous line bundles L\u03bb , it preserves the divisors Z\u03bb , and so each principal part has\na well defined (multi)-degree m in Zn(P ) .\nii) Rational maps and the sheaf of principal parts. The spaces LG/PLG admit a\na\n\"scaling\" equivalence onto the homogeneous space LGa /PLG\nof loops on the circle\na\n|z| = |a|, by associating to the loop f the loop f (z) = f (z/a). More generally,\na\nb\nthere are equivalences LGa /PLG\n\u2192 LGb /PLG\n. However, using the identifications\n(5.3)\n\na\nLGa /PLG\n= bundles (plus flags) on P1 trivialised over |z| \u2265 |a|,\n\nthere is another map given by restriction for |a| \u2264 |b|:\n(5.4)\n\na\nb\nra,b : LGa /PLG\n\u2192 LGb /PLG\n.\n\nLet us take a limit, and set\n\u221e\nLG\u221e /PLG\n={ bundles (plus flags) on P1\n\n(5.5)\n\ntrivialised over some disk centred at z = \u221e}.\n\n\u221e\n5.6. Proposition. A based map F of P1 into LG\u221e /PLG\n, with basing condition\nF (\u221e) = I, is equivalent to a holomorphic G-bundle over P1 \u00d7 P1 , trivialised over\n{\u221e} \u00d7 P1 \u222a P1 \u00d7 {\u221e}, with a reduction to P over z = 0.\n\nProof. It is clear that such a map F is equivalent to a holomorphic G-bundle over\nP1 \u00d7P1 , trivialised over V \u00d7P1 \u222aP1 \u00d7{\u221e}, for some open set V containing infinity.\nHowever, if a bundle is trivial over \u221e \u00d7 P1 , it is trivial over V \u00d7 P1 for some open\nset V ; a trivialisation on {\u221e} \u00d7 P1 \u222a P1 \u00d7 {\u221e} extends to V \u00d7 P1 \u222a P1 \u00d7 {\u221e}. \u0003\n5.7. Corollary. A compact family, parametrised by K, of holomorphic G-bundles\nover P1 \u00d7 P1 , trivialised over {\u221e} \u00d7 P1 \u222a P1 \u00d7 {\u221e}, is equivalent to a compact\na\nfamily, parametrised by K, of based maps F of P1 into LGa /PLG\n, for some a, with\nbasing condition F (\u221e) = I.\n5.8. Theorem. The map which associates to a holomorphic map of degree k in\n\u221e\nHol\u2217 (P1 , LG\u221e /PLG\n) of degree k the corresponding section in Hk0 (C, Pr) of the\nspace of configurations of principal parts of total degree k is an isomorphism.\nProof. The proof follows that given in [BHMM2]. We begin by noting that open\nsets V mapped into the big cell, where the principal part is trivial, yield trivial Gbundles over P1 \u00d7 V equipped with a reduction to BG at {\u221e} \u00d7 V and a reduction\nto NG over {0} \u00d7 V . The fact that the bundles are trivial on P1 \u00d7 V means that\nthe reduction at 0 can be transported to \u221e; as we are on the big cell, we have that\nthese two reductions, to NG and BG , intersect transversally in a point in the fiber\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n19\n\nof E over \u221e. In other words, over the big cell, the bundles we obtain are naturally\ntrivialised at \u221e, and indeed then trivialised globally on P1 \u00d7 V . Two such bundles\ncan then be glued in a unique way.\nReturning to our map, we see that it is naturally injective; a configuration of\nprincipal parts determines transition functions, and the equivalence relation in their\ndefinition translates into bundle equivalence. Surjectivity follows from a glueing\nconstruction. One covers P1 by disjoint disks Vi , i = 1, . . . , j surrounding the\npoints pi which are mapped outside the big cell, and by V0 = P1 \\{p1 , p2 , . . . , pj };\none can lift the principal part over the Vi to \u03c6i \u2208 Hol(Vi , LG/PLG ), and so bundles\nEi which we then glue, using the unique glueing, to the trivial bundle over P1 \u00d7 V0\nover the intersection P1 \u00d7 (V0 \u2229 Vi ).\n\u0003\nFollowing the model of maps of P1 into P1 , we refer to the points of the source\nP over which there is a non-trivial principal part as the poles of the map. As noted\nabove, each pole has a well defined multiplicity m = (m0 , m1 , .., mn(P ) ), given by\nthe order of vanishing of the pullbacks v\u03bbi at the pole.\nThere are well defined pole location maps\n1\n\n(5.9)\n\n\u221e\n\u03c0i : Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG\u221e /PLG\n) \u2192 SP ki (C) = Cki\n\ngiven by associating to a rational map F the divisor of F \u2217 v\u03bbi , which sums to\n\u221e\n\u03a0 : Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG\u221e /PLG\n) \u2192 SP |k|(C) = C|k|\nQ\ngiven by associating to a rational map F the divisor of F \u2217 ( \u03bb\u2208\u039bP v\u03bb ). Here |k| is\nPn(P )\nthe scalar multiplicity i=0 ki . Here SP denotes the symmetric product.\n\u221e\n) to define a local prinWe can use the analytic structure of Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG\u221e /PLG\ncipal parts space of multiplicity k:\n\n(5.10)\n\n(5.11)\n\nLPrk = (\u03c00 , .., \u03c0n(P ) )\u22121 (0, 0, . . . , 0).\n\nOur theorem 5.8 tells us in essence that over other points\n(5.12)\n\n(\u03c00 , .., \u03c0n(P ) )\u22121 (a0 , . . . , an(P ) )\n\nis a product of local principal part spaces LPrmi .\niii) Deformations and smoothness. The infinitesimal version of this theorem is\nworth noting. Given a map F , corresponding to a bundle E with reductions R\nto BG at {\u221e} and a reduction to NG over {0}, one wants to consider infinitesimal deformations of F and of E. For the map, a deformation gives a unique\na\nsection of F \u2217 (T (LGa /PLG\n)); deformations of the bundle are given by H 1 (P1 \u00d7\nP1 , ad(E)(0, \u22121)); if one adds in the reductions at zero and infinity, one considers\ninstead of ad(E) the subsheaf ad(E)(\u2212R) of sections taking values in the pG subbundle at zero and the nG subbundle at infinity corresponding to the reductions, so\nthat deformations of the pair (E, R) are given by H 1 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)).\n(The twist (0, \u22121) represents the basing condition at x = \u221e).\nNow let us consider the sequence of sheaves 5.2, and consider deformations of\nglobal sections, taking into account the basing conditions. One has\na\n0 \u2192 H 0 (P1 , nLG (\u22121)) \u2192 H 0 (P1 , F \u2217 (T (LGa /PLG\n))(\u22121)) \u2192 H 0 (P1 , Q)\n\n(5.13)\n\n\u2192 H 1 (P1 , nLG (\u22121)) . . .\n\nHere Q represents infinitesimal deformations of F \u2217 Pr; using the definitions of Pr,\nthis is identified in a straightforward fashion with R1 \u03c0\u2217 (ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)), where\n\n\f20\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\n\u03c0 is the projection \u03c0 : P1 \u00d7 P1 \u2192 P1 ). In turn, the groups H i (P1 , nLG (\u22121)) are\nzero, as nLG has a filtration ni with abelian quotients, and H i (P1 , O(\u22121)) = 0.\nThis then gives\n5.14. Proposition.\na\nH 0 (P1 , F \u2217 (T (LGa /PLG\n))(\u22121)) = H 0 (P1 , R1 \u03c0\u2217 (ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)))\n\n= H 1 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)).\nWe have\n\u221e\n5.15. Proposition. The space of maps Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG\u221e /PLG\n) is smooth.\n\nIt suffices to show that the space of deformations H 1 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(\u22121))\nof the equivalent data (E, R) is of constant rank; for this it suffices that H i (P1 \u00d7\nP1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)) = 0, i = 0, 2. To see that H 0 (P1 \u00d7P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121)) =\n0, we use the fact that ad(E)(\u2212R) is trivial, and so ad(E)(\u2212R)(0, \u22121) is negative,\nover the open set of lines {z} \u00d7 P1 over which E is trivial. Dually, H 2 (P1 \u00d7\nP1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(\u22121)) = H 0 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R))\u2217 (\u22121, \u22122)) = 0 for the same reason.\nAs H 1 (P1 , ad(E)(\u2212R)(\u22121)) represents effective deformations of (E, R), we also\na\nhave that H 0 (P1 , F \u2217 (T (LGa /PLG\n))(\u22121)) represents effective deformations of F .\niv) Dimensions and a formal degree for F \u2217 (T (LG/PLG). In finite dimensions,\none can calculate the degree of the pullback under a map F : P1 \u2192 G/P of\nthe tangent bundle to a flag manifold, in terms of weights of the group. On the\nother hand, by Riemann-Roch this degree is equal to the Euler characteristic of\nF \u2217 (T (LG/PLG))(\u22121). Elements of H 0 (P1 , F \u2217 (T (LG/PLG ))(\u22121)) correspond to\nthe tangent vectors to the space of based maps to the flag manifold; on the other\nhand, a positivity argument tells us that H 1 (P1 , F \u2217 T (G/P )(\u22121)) = 0, and so our\nEuler characteristic is equal to the dimension of the space of based maps, which is\nthus computed in terms of weights of the group.\nIn our case, the analogous argument does not work, as the tangent bundle is infinite dimensional; nevertheless, one can compute the dimension of the corresponding\nspace of (framed) bundles, which turns out to be given by the same formula in terms\nof weights. In this sense one has a formal degree for F \u2217 (T (LG/PLG)).\nWe recapitulate the finite dimensional argument. The determinant of the bundle\nF \u2217 (T (G/P )) is a homogeneous line bundle arising from a character \u01eb of P acting on\ndet(g/p). As the\nPfundamental weights span the dual to the torus space we certainly\nhave that \u01eb = i\u2208\u25b3 ni \u03bbi . But if \u03c3i is a simple root reflection in the Weyl group\nfor a simple root in \u25b30 then \u03c3i is represented by an element of P . However \u01eb is a\ncharacter of P so \u03c3(\u01eb) = \u01eb. But \u03c3i (\u03bbj ) = \u03bbj \u2212 \u03b4ji \u03b1j so ni = 0 whenever i is in \u25b30\nso that\nX\nni \u03bbi\n\u01eb=\u2212\ni6\u2208\u25b30\n\nand it follows that\n\nd =2c1 (det(F \u22121 T G/P ))\nX\n=2\nni ki\ni6\u2208\u25b30\n\n(5.16)\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n21\n\nwhere ki are the degrees of the map into G/P .\nIt is useful to have a formulae for the ni that we can compute with. Note first\nthat \u01eb = 2(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1P ) where \u03c1 is half the sum of the positive roots and the \u03c1P is half\nthe sum of the positive roots in P . (This is where the finite dimensionality comes\nin.) Standard results (see for instance [Hum1]) tell us that\nX\n\u03c1=\n\u03bbi\ni\u2208\u25b3\n\nand that\n\nX\n\n\u03c1P =\n\n\u03bb\u0302i ,\n\ni\u2208\u25b30\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0302i is the orthogonal projection, with the Killing form, of \u03bbi onto t\u2217P . That is\nthe \u03bb\u0302i are the fundamental weights for gP extended to be zero on t\u22a5\nP . We have for\ni \u2208 \u22060 :\nX\nnij \u03bbj\n\u03bb\u0302i = \u03bbi \u2212\nj6\u2208\u25b30\n\nfor some constants nij . For each j 6\u2208 \u25b30 , let\nX\nnij\nNj =\ni\u2208\u25b30\n\nthen\n\n\u01eb = 2(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1P ) = 2(\n\nX\n\ni6\u2208\u25b30\n\nso\nd=4\n\nX\n\n(\u03bbi +\n\nX\n\nnji \u03bbj ),\n\nj\u2208\u25b30\n\n(1 + Ni )ki .\n\ni6\u2208\u25b30\n\nIt is interesting to see that this formula can be applied also for loop groups because,\nalthough there are infinitely many positive roots, the weights \u03c1 and \u03c1P are still welldefined as sums of fundamental weights. We will check that this formula gives us\nthe right dimension.\n5.17. Proposition. The dimension of H 0 (P1 , F \u2217 (T (LG/PLG ))(\u22121)) is\nX\n(1 + Ni )ki .\n4\ni6\u2208\u25b30\n\nWe begin with the maximal parabolic Pmax in LG corresponding to all of G, i.e.\nwith the case\n\u25b30 = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r }.\nWe want the dimension of the space of framed bundles, which will be given by\nh1 (P1 \u00d7P1 , ad(E)(0, \u22121)). By our smoothness result, this is equal to minus the Euler characteristic. This, in turn, using Atiyah's correspondence between instantons\nand spaces of rational maps into LG/P+ LG, was calculated in terms of instantons\nby Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer[AHS]. We want the dimension of the space of framed\ninstantons which is obtained from their formula by adding on the dimension of K.\nThis gives\n1\nk,\n4\n< \u03b8, \u03b8 >\nwhere k is the charge of the instanton and \u03b8 is the longest root of K.\n\n\f22\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nNow recall from section 2 that the simple roots of the affine Lie algebra corresponding to the loop group of K are obtained by adding\n\u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b8\nto the roots \u03b11 , . . . , ar = \u03b1r of the finite dimensional algebra and the corresponding\nfundamental weights are\nl0 = \u03b3, l1 =\n\n2 < \u03b8, \u03bbr >\n2 < \u03b8, \u03bb1 >\n+ \u03bb1 , . . . , lr =\n+ \u03bbr .\n< \u03b8, \u03b8 >\n< \u03b8, \u03b8 >\n\nHere as above \u03b8 is the highest root and we have modified the formula in [M] where\nit is assumed that the Killing form has been normalised so that < \u03b8, \u03b8 >= 2.

A proof can also be given as follows. It is, of course, enough to know that\n(5.18)\n\n2 < \u03c1, \u03b8 > + < \u03b8, \u03b8 >= 1.\n\nRecall that the Casimir operator for G in the adjoint representations, cad , commutes\nwith the adjoint action of K so, by Schur's lemma is a scalar multiple of the identity.\nThis scalar multiple is\nh\u03c1 + \u03b8, \u03c1 + \u03b8i \u2212 h\u03c1, \u03c1i\nor just the LHS of 5.18. So we have\ntr(cad ) = dim(K)(2h\u03c1, \u03b8i + h\u03b8, \u03b8i).\nOn the other hand the Casimir is defined by\ndim(K)\n\ncad =\n\nX\ni=1\n\nad(Xi ) ad(Yi ),\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n23\n\nwhere Xi is a basis for k and Yi a dual basis with respect to the Killing form.

The complement Z of the big cell in LG/PLG is\ncut out by the sections v\u03bb of L\u03bb . As we deform the principal part, the pull -back of\nv\u03bb moves. Infinitesimally, given a tangent vector X at a point of Z\u03bb , we can take\na derivative X(v\u03bb ) of the defining section v\u03bb; this is realised explicitly by\nT (LG/PLG ) = LG \u00d7PLG Lg/pLG \u2192 L\u03bb /Im(v\u03bb ) = LG \u2297PLG C\u03bb /Im(v\u03bb )\n(5.20)\n\n(g, a) 7\u2192 (g, \u03c0(\u2212ag \u22121 v\u03bb )).\n\nOne checks that this is well defined and that it maps the image of nLG in T (LG/PLG)\nto zero, so that one has a map T (LG/PLG )/nLG \u2192 L\u03bb /Im(v\u03bb ).

Configurations of principal parts, and stabilisation\n\nThe preceeding description of Theorem 5.8 of G-bundles on P1 \u00d7 P1 (equipped\nwith flags) as sections over P1 of a sheaf of principal parts gives us in some sense\nan algorithmic way of constructing them: if one wants to build a bundle (with\nflag) of total degree k = (k0 , k1 , . . . , kn(P ) ), one first chooses r multiplicities mi =\n(mi0 , mi1 , . . . . , min(P ) ), i = 1, . . . , r summing to (k0 , k1 , . . . , kn(P ) ) and r points pi\nin C \u2282 P1 ; one then glues in to the trivialized bundle near each pi a principal\npart in LPrmi . This describes the moduli space Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) of based maps\nas a space of labelled particles over C, where the labels are the multiplicities and\nthe principal parts; the space is stratified by the pattern of multiplicities of the\nparticles.\n\n\f24\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nLet \u03b4i be the multiplicity (0, . . . 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), with 1 in the i-th position.

This stabilisation preserves\nthe stratification by multiplicity patterns.\nWe want to understand the behaviour of the homology of Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG )\nas k increases. The homology of spaces of labelled particles has been extensively\nstudied (see, e.g, the book of Cohen, Lada and May [CLM]). The sources of cycles,\nare, not surprisingly, two-fold: either cycles in the space of labels, or cycles in\nconfigurations of points. Roughly, on each multiplicity stratum, the homology\nstabilises as one adds in more points of multiplicity \u03b4i ; a more precise statement\nwill follow. On the whole space, the homology will stabilise also, provided that the\ncodimension of the strata increases with the number of points of high multiplicity\nin the stratum; again we will give a more precise statement below.\nThus, as we shall see, the homology of the space stabilises; the question will then\nbe to what. We will appeal to a result of Gravesen [Gra], which will tell us that the\nlimit is homology equivalent to the space of continuous maps M ap\u2217k (P1 , LG/PLG );\nthis space, up to homotopy, is independent of k. We note that from a variational\npoint of view, this result is quite appealing. The space Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ), when\nPLG = LG+ , represents the moduli space of instantons on the four sphere, while\nthe corresponding space of continuous maps is the space of all connections on the\nfour-sphere. The instantons minimise the energy functional on connections; thus\nour statement is that as one increases charge, the homology of the space of minima\napproximates that of the whole space. This result, which is known as the AtiyahJones conjecture, is already established for the classical groups; we now give a proof\nfor all compact groups. Another case of stabilisation covered by the result is that\nof calorons, instantons on R3 \u00d7 S 1 satisfying appropriate boundary conditions.\nWe also show that the result can be extended from homology groups to homotopy\ngroups.\nThe results are an almost verbatim application of [BHMM1, BHMM2, BHM];\nwe will mostly be quoting theorems, and only outlining the points which need\nmodification.\ni) Stratification and codimensions\nWe now describe in more detail the stratification of our space Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ).\nFollowing [BHMM1], we define a stratum associated to each collection of multiindices\n(6.2)\n\nM = {m1 , . . . , mr }\n\nPr\nsuch that i=1 mi = k. The stratum consist of configurations with r \"poles\", of\nmultiplicities {m1 , . . . , mr }. One can project from a principal part to its location;\nassociated to M, we have a smooth stratum CM of SP (Ck0 ) \u00d7 SP (Ck1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7\nSP (Ckn(P ) ) consisting of configurations of r points with multiplicities m1 , . . . , mr ,\nand a projection:\n(6.3)\n\n(\u03c00 , .., \u03c0n(P ) ) : SM \u2192 CM\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n25\n\nThe fiber over a point of CM is the product LP rm1 \u00d7 LP rm2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 LP rmr . We\nnote that the strata SM are not necessarily smooth. We can, however, stratify it\nby smooth varieties, for example using the Whitney stratification\n(6.4)\n\nSM = \u222aSM,j .\n\nJust as in [BHMM1], section 6, one can then show that one can order this finite set\nof strata in such a way that\n\u2022 The lowest order element is a dense open set; more generally, the unions\nof all submanifolds of a given order l or less is dense and open\n\u2022 The normal bundle of the l-th stratum is orientable in the union of strata\nof order less than l.\nWe now want to estimate the codimension of the strata SM in terms of the\nmultiplicity. We follow, with some variation, the procedure of [BHMM1]. There\nwere, in [BHMM1], three steps;\n\u2022 One shows, for any l and any principal part R of degree m, that there is\na map F of some degree K with R as one of its principal parts, at p, say,\nsuch that the family of holomorphic maps around F submerges at p onto\nthe jets of a given order l of maps into G/P ;\n\u2022 One then bounds at a pole the codimension of the variety of jets of multiplicity m within the variety of jets.\n\u2022 The two first steps bound the codimension within the variety of maps\nHolK ; one then uses the local decomposition HolK = Holm \u00d7 HolK\u2212m\ninduced by the principal parts picture to get the same codimension within\nHolm .\nIn our case, as we are in infinite dimensions, the first step must be modified.\nFortunately, we have theorem 4.1, which tells us that at a point of the strata at\ninfinity (which point we will take to be wPLG , without loss of generality), there is\n\u2212\nw\na decomposition of the space into an infinite dimensional orbit of ULG\n= NLG\n\u2229\n\u2212\n\u22121\nwULG w , which preserves the stratification of LG/PLG , and, transversally, a finite\n\u2212\nw\u22121 . It suffices to show, then, that there\ndimensional orbit of Aw = NLG \u2229 wULG\nis a submersion, for high degree, onto the \"jets in the Aw -direction\". This amounts\nto asking that the quotient bundle\n(6.5)\n\n0 \u2192 uLG \u2229 wnLG w\u22121 \u2192 F \u2217 T (LG/PLG) \u2192 Q \u2192 0\n\nbe a sum \u2295O(ai ) with all ai at least l. This means that the map on global sections\ncan have arbitrary jets at a point, and so the application will be submersive.\nLet us therefore consider an element R of LPr of degree m = (m0 , . . . , mn(P ) )\nevaluating to wPLG . We choose a map \u03c3 : P1 \u2192 P1 of degree l, with \u03c3 \u22121 (1) =\n\u2217\n{p1 , . . . , pl } distinct points. We first create a map F in Holm\n(P1 , LG/PLG ) with a\n\u22121\nsingle pole by glueing in at z = 1 the principal part R \u25e6 \u03c3 , where \u03c3 \u22121 is the local\ninverse of \u03c3 at p1 . The composition F \u25e6 \u03c3 then has principal part R at p1 , as well\nas l \u2212 1 other principal parts of multiplicity m at {p2 , . . . , pl }. It also has l points\n{q1 , . . . , ql } counted with multiplicity (the points in \u03c3 \u22121 (\u221e)) at which the map\ntakes value the base point PLG . Now let us look at the image in Q of the trivial\n\u22121\nbundle u+\n; it spans Q at p1 (and so its image is of full rank), and its\nLG \u2229 wnLG w\nimage vanishes at l points qi . This implies that Q is indeed a sum \u2295O(ai ), ai \u2265 l.\n\u2212\n\u2212\nw\n= NLG\n\u2229 wULG\nw\u22121 , the map to jets is\nThus, transversally to the orbit of ULG\nlocally surjective.\n\n\f26\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nWe now look at the space of J l of l jets into LG/PLG , and ask ourselves what is\nthe codimension in this set of the multiplicity m jets. If the divisor \"at infinity\" Z,\nwhose complement is the big cell, were smooth with normal crossings, one would\nhave codimension |m|, as is easily seen from a computation in local coordinates.\nLet v = 0 be a defining equation for Z. If the divisor is not smooth, one still has\n[BHMM1], by blowing up:\n6.6. Proposition. [BHMM1], There are constants c > 0 and c\u2032 \u2265 0 independent of\n|m| such that the codimension of the subvariety of the jets such that the pull back\nof v vanishes to order |m| is at least c * |m| \u2212 c\u2032 .\nThe submersion result then implies that the same codimension holds at our\npoint in the the space of holomorphic maps of sufficiently high degree K, by our\nsubmersion result. On the other hand, near our map, one has a local decomposition\nHolK = Holm \u00d7 HolK\u2212m , and so the codimension holds inside of Holm . Thus,\nthe codimension in Holm of the maps with one simple pole of multiplicity m is\nbounded below by c|m| \u2212 c\u2032 .\nDoing this for each pole of multiplicity mi in the stratum gives:\n6.7. Proposition. ([BHMM1], Proposition 6.6) There exists a positive constant\nc(LG/PLG ) which is independent of the stratum indices M and the multi-degree k,\nso that the complex codimension of SM in Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) is bounded below by\nX\n(|mi | \u2212 1).\nc(LG/PLG )\ni\n\nii) Stabilisation on strata, and on the whole space. We have defined stabilisation\nmaps Ti which to a configuration of principal parts add a fixed principal part of\nmultiplicity \u03b4i . For a stratum SM , let si (M) be the number of multiplicities in the\ncollection M equal to \u03b4i . One has the general theorem from [BHMM1],[BHMM2]:\n6.8. Theorem. For all coefficient rings, the stabilisation map\n(6.9)\n\nTi : SM \u2192 SM\u222a{\u03b4i }\n\ninduces isomorphisms in homology groups Hj for j \u2264 [si (M)/2].\nRoughly speaking, the cycles in SM\u222a{\u03b4i } for which one needs the extra labelled\npoint only occur in dimensions greater than [si (M)/2].\nThe homology groups of the strata fit together through a Leray spectral sequence\nto give the homology of the whole space. Let Ik be the index set for the strata.\nFor each k and all coefficient rings A, there are homology Leray spectral sequences E r (Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ); A) which converge to filtrations of the homology\nH\u2217 (Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ); A) with\nM\nE 1 (Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ); A) \u223c\nH\u2217 (\u03a32cd(M,j,k) (SM,j )+ ; A)\n=\nIk\n\nwhere 2cd(M, j, k) is the real codimension of SM,j in Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ). The homology of the strata thus appears in the spectral sequence, suspended by the codimension. Furthermore, the inclusions Ti induce maps of spectral sequences\n\u2217\n(P1 , LG/PLG ); A).\nT\u0303i : E r (Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ); A) \u2212\u2192 E r (Holk+\u03b4\ni\n\nBuilding first the homology of the strata, we see first that the homology of the\nstrata with many poles of order one stabilises; then, in the spectral sequence the\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n27\n\nhomology of strata with few poles of order one gets suspended upwards by a high\ncodimension. Combining the two effects gives us a stabilisation for homology.\nIf k, k\u2032 are two multi-indices, we set k < k\u2032 if k\u2032 \u2212 k contains only zero or\npositive entries. Given two such multi-indices, one can define a stabilisation Tk,k\u2032 :\nHolk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) \u2192 Holk\u2217 \u2032 (P1 , LG/PLG ) by composing the appropriate number\nof Ti 's. (These maps commute up to homotopy). Now set l(k) = min(ki )i=1,...,n(P ) .\n6.10. Theorem. [BHMM1] For all coefficient rings A, the stabilisation\nTk,k\u2032 : Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) \u2192 Holk\u2217 \u2032 (P1 , LG/PLG )\ninduces isomorphisms in homology groups Hj for j \u2264 [min(1/2, c(LG/PLG))l(k)] \u2212\n1.\niii) Stabilisation to the space of continuous maps\nWe have now seen that the homology of our spaces stabilises; as noted above,\nthe question is then to what. For this, we can exploit the result of Gravesen [Gra],\nwho builds a limit space of configurations of principal parts, and shows that it is\nhomology equivalent to the space of based continuous maps \u03a92 (LG/PLG ). One\nthen has, as in [BHMM1], with the proofs going over verbatim:\n6.11. Theorem. [BHMM1] For all coefficient rings A, the inclusion\nI : Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) \u2192 \u03a92k (LG/PLG )\ninduces isomorphisms in homology groups Hj for j \u2264 [min(1/2, c(LG/PLG))l(k)] \u2212\n1.\niv) Homotopy groups\nThere remains the question of extending the results to homotopy groups. For\nthis, one shows that the homology of the universal covers stabilises, and then appeals to Whitehead's theorem. The proof, once one has the principal parts description, repeats the analysis of [BHM], and we will not go through it here, except to\nremark that one shows first that the fundamental group is Abelian, as soon as one\nhas ki > 1 for each i. The reason for this is that one can arrange for a loop to\nlive in a configuration with one multiplicity one pole of each type. If one has two\nloops in the space, and all ki at least two, one can place one loop in a configuration over a disk, and the second loop in a configuration over a second disjoint\ndisk. The two loops then commute for obvious geometrical reasons. Once one has\nthis fact, the rest of the analysis in [BHM] involves understanding the homology of\nAbelian covers of particle spaces enough to prove stabilisation. This analysis is not\nstraightforward, but yields:\n6.12. Theorem. [BHMM1] The inclusion\nI : Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/PLG ) \u2192 \u03a92k (LG/PLG )\ninduces isomorphisms in homotopy groups \u03c0j for j \u2264 [min(1/2, c(LG/PLG))l(k)] \u2212\ns \u2212 2, where s is the rank of \u03c03 (LG/PLG ).\nIn particular, the homotopy groups of the moduli spaces of G-bundles P1 \u00d7 P1\nwith zero degree, trivialised on {P1 \u00d7 \u221e} \u222a{\u221e\u00d7 P1 } and a reduction to a parabolic\nP over {P1 \u00d70} stabilise as one increases both the second Chern class and the degree\nof the flag.\n\n\f28\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nv) Atiyah-Jones type conjectures.\nv.1. Instantons. Let PLG = LG+ , and let G = KC for a compact semi-simple\ngroup K. One has the theorem, due to Donaldson [Do]:\n6.13. Theorem. The moduli space MK,k of framed K-instantons of charge k on\nthe four-sphere is isomorphic to the moduli space Holk\u2217 (P1 , LG/LG+ )\nCoupled with the isomorphism \u03a92 (LG/LG+ ) \u2243 \u03a93 K, one then has, as a result\nof our theorem:\n6.14. Corollary. (Atiyah-Jones conjecture) There are positive constants c, c\u2032 such\nthat the inclusion MK,k \u2192 \u03a93 K induces isomorphisms in homotopy groups \u03c0j for\nj \u2264 c|k| \u2212 c\u2032 .\nThe space \u03a93 K, as noted by Atiyah and Jones [AJ] is the space of all connections\non the four sphere, modulo gauge. The statement is thus that the space of minima\nof the energy functional captures the topology as one increases the charge. As\nnoted in the introduction, this result is proven for the classical groups [BHMM2,\nKi2, Ti1, Ti2]; this gives it for all groups. The techniques of [HM] should also apply\nto extend the result from the four sphere to ruled surfaces.\nv.2. Calorons. Instead of instantons, one can consider calorons. As in [GM,\nCH, NS], K-calorons are anti-self-dual K-connections on R3 \u00d7 S 1 , with asymptotic\nbehaviour that resembles that of R3 -monopole. We view R3 \u00d7 S 1 as the quotient\nof the standard Euclidean R4 by the time translation (t, x) 7\u2192 (t + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 , x). Let\nA be a K-connection on R3 \u00d7 S 1 ; we write it in coordinates over R4 as\nX\nAi dxi .\n(6.15)\nA = \u03c6dt +\ni=1,2,3\n\n2\n\nWe require that the L norm of the curvature of A be finite, and that in suitable\ngauges, the Ai be O(|x|\u22122 ), and that \u03c6 be conjugate to (\u03bc\u2212k/2|x|\u22121 +O(|x|\u22122 )), for\nconstant elements of the Lie algebra \u03bc, k. The element k lies in a cone in a lattice,\nand represents a monopole charge. There are also have bounds on the derivatives of\nthese fields, which tell us in essence that in a suitable way the connection extends\nto the 2-sphere at infinity times S 1 ; furthermore, one can show that the extension\nis to a fixed connection, which involves fixing a trivialisation at infinity; there is\nthus a second invariant we can define, the relative second Chern class, which we\nrepresent by a (positive) integer k0 , the instanton charge. If this latter charge is\nzero, the connection is in fact simply a monopole, lifted from R3 .\nOne has, for K = SU (2), the theorem ([CH]) :\n6.16. Theorem. The moduli space MSU(2),k0 ,k1 of framed K-calorons of instanton charge k0 and monopole charge k1 is isomorphic to the moduli space of maps\nHolk\u22170 ,k1 (P1 , LSL(2, C)/BLSL(2,C) ), which in turn is the space of rank 2 bundles\nof second Chern class k0 on P1 \u00d7 P1 , trivialised on {P1 \u00d7 \u221e} \u222a {\u221e \u00d7 P1 }, with a\nsubline bundle of degree \u2212k1 on {P1 \u00d7 0}.\nThis theorem is quite likely true, with the necessary modifications, for all other\ncompact groups K, though the techniques of [CH] are not likely to adapt well. If\nwe accept this as given, we then have:\n\n\fLOOP GROUPS AND HOLOMORPHIC BUNDLES\n\n29\n\n6.17. Corollary. (Atiyah-Jones conjecture for calorons.) There are positive constants c, c\u2032 such that the inclusion MK,k0 ,k \u2192 \u03a92k0 ,k (LG/PLG ) induces isomorphisms in homotopy groups \u03c0j for j \u2264 c|k| \u2212 c\u2032 .\n7. Outer automorphisms and Hecke transforms\nThe elements of our loop group flag manifolds, when these flag manifolds correspond to flag manifolds on the finite dimensional group, yield bundles on P1 ,\nequipped with flags F 0 along z = 0, as well as trivialisations on a neighbourhood\nof z = \u221e. This trivialisation allows us also to choose a flag F \u221e along z = \u221e.\nAt least for the classical groups, this allows us to define Hecke transformations H,\ngiving us other bundles and flags; from the loop group point of view, they are given\nby the action of the outer automorphisms. These, as we have seen, are classified\nby symmetries of the extended Dynkin diagram corresponding to the loop group.\nWe consider each family of classical groups in turn:\n7.1. Sl(n,C). Here, the outer automorphisms group is cyclic of order n, and generated by a single transformation defined as follows. Let T be an element of\nLSL(n, C)/BLSL(n,C) ; it determines a bundle E on P1 equipped with flags E10 \u2282\n0\n... \u2282 En\u22121\nover z = 0, and a trivialisation over |z| > 1, so that one can choose in a\n\u221e\nfixed way a flag E1\u221e \u2282 ... \u2282 En\u22121\nover z = \u221e. We remember by (3.4) that one not\nonly has one sheaf, but a whole nested sequence E i,j = (E 0 )i,j ; likewise, the flag\nstructure at infinity gives us in parallel (E \u221e )i,j . Now define the Hecke transform\nH(E) by\nH(E)\n\n= E away from z = 0, \u221e,\n(E 0 )0,n\u22121 near z = 0,\n(E \u221e )1,1 near z = \u221e.\n\nIn short, one allows a pole in one component at infinity, and forces one component\nto vanish at zero; the result still has degree zero, and indeed has an overall volume\nform. On the level of transition functions T , as we saw above, the Hecke transform\noperates by conjugating by the matrix A(z \u22121 ), where A(z) is the matrix (2.1). The\nn-th power of the Hecke transform, up to inner automorphicms, is the identity.\nThis transform can of course be applied to families, in particular families parametrised by a Riemann surface. We saw that each such family E had associated to\nit an n-tuple of degrees K(E) = (k1 , ..., kn ). One checks that the Hecke transform\npermutes the degrees cyclically by K(H(E)) = (kn , k1 , ..., kn\u22121 ).\nOne has an action permuting the components of Hol(\u03a3, LSL(n, C)/BLSL(n,C) )\nof different degrees amongst themselves. In particular, for \u03a3 = P1 , the moduli\nspaces correspond to moduli of calorons, and the Hecke transform permutes these.\nThere are several special cases. The first is that of degree (k, k, .., k), which\ncorresponds (see 4.8) to instanton bundles, trivial (and with the trivial flag) along\nthe line z = 0 (this is, in fact, a dense subset of the instanton moduli); here\nthe Hecke transform acts by automorphisms. These automorphisms have natural\ninterpretations in terms of the monad representation of the bundles: indeed, the\nholomorphic bundles of rank n with c2 = k corresponding to SU (n)-instantons are\nencoded in four-tuples of matrices A, B, C, D with A, B k \u00d7 k, C k \u00d7 n, and D\nn \u00d7 k. These matrices satisfy the constraint [A, B] + CD = 0, as well as some\nnon-degeneracy constraints, and the correspondence is bijective, up to the action of\n\n\f30\n\nJACQUES HURTUBISE AND MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nGl(k, C) by g(A, B, C, D) = (gAg \u22121 , gBg \u22121 , gC, Dg \u22121 ). The additional constraint\nof triviality along z = 0 tells us that A is invertible. Writing the columns of C as\nCi , and the rows of D as Di , i = 1, ..., n, the Hecke transform acts by\n(A, B, C1 , .., Cn , D1 , .., Dn ) 7\u2192 (A, B\u2212C1 D1 A\u22121 , C2 , .., Cn , AC1 , D2 , .., Dn , D1 A\u22121 ).\nIf one iterates this n times, this gives (A, (BA \u2212 CD)A\u22121 = ABA\u22121 , AC, DA\u22121 ) =\nA(A, B, C, D), bringing us back to the initial point.\nAnother special case is obtained by setting the last degree to zero: one has degree\n(k1 , .., kn\u22121 , 0); these are trivial bundles with flags of subbundles, and correspond\nto monopoles. The Hecke transform permutes these spaces amongst themselves or\nwith caloron spaces .\nSimilarly, replacing Borels by parabolics, one has actions of the Hecke transform\nmapping the moduli space for one parabolic to the moduli space for another.\nThese Hecke transforms on calorons have natural realisations in terms of Nahm\ntransfoms of the calorons, or monopoles. We recall that the Nahm transform attaches to each element of the moduli space of calorons of degree (k1 , .., kn ) a solution\nto Nahm's equations on the circle ([NS]). The solution involves partitioning the\ncircle into n consecutive intervals (\u03bci , \u03bci+1 ) with \u03bcn and \u03bc1 representing the same\npoint. The \u03bci represent appropriate physical constants associated to the problem\n(\"masses\"). On each interval, one has solutions to some non-linear o.d.e., Nahm's\nequations, given by ki \u00d7 ki matrices, and at the boundary points, some boundary\nconditions. The Hecke transform simply amounts in this case to rotating the order\nof the intervals. We note that this also permutes the masses, and could conceivably\ncorrespond to some form of physical duality, or rather, n-ality.\nReferences\n[A]\n\nM.F.
