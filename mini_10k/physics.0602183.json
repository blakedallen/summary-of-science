The led matching of spectrums\nof p-chloronitrobenzene with p-bromochlorobenzene and p-dibromobenzene has shown that the\nsignificant line broadening in p-chloronitrobenzene is caused not only clutter in allocation of\nmolecules concerning parasubstitution benzol. It is necessary to consider also and clutter in\nrotational displacements of the nitro of group concerning a plane of a molecule. Calculations of\nfrequency spectra were led on a method the Dyne.\nPACS: 78.30. E; 61.72. J; 61.66. H; 78.30. J\n\nIn a number of operations spectrums of\nchips\nconsisting\nas\nfrom\ncentrosymmetric,\nand\nnot\ncentrosymmetric molecules [1] were\nstudied. Chips of builders were\nisomorphous. Crystallization of not\ncentrosymmetric\nmolecules\nin\ncentrosymmetric space group is\npossible at statistically disorder layout\nof\nmolecules\nconcerning\nparasubstitution rules of benzol. On\ntheir instance it is possible to observe\nagency of statistical clutter on a line\nbroadening. In the yielded operation\nappearance of additional lines caused is\nnot observed by clutter.\nFor\ncomparative\nlearning\nisomorphous\nchips\nof\npdibromobenzene,\npbromochlorobenzene\nand\npchloronitrobenzene have been selected.\nThere are their X-ray diffraction data\n[2]. On X-ray diffraction data p-\n\nbromochlorobenzene\nand\npchloronitrobenzene crystallize in the\nspace group P21/a with two molecules\nin unit cell owing to statistically\ndisorder\nlayout\nof\nmolecules\nconcerning parasubstitution benzol. In a\nspectrum of the lattice oscillations of\nsuch perfect crystals it should be\nobserved six lines, the molecules\ncaused by rotational oscillations.\nIn the yielded operation\nparameters of the polarized Raman\nspectrums of the lattice oscillations of\np-dibromobenzene,\npbromochlorobenzene\nand\npchloronitrobenzene are studied.

This broadening is\ncaused by clutter in layout of molecules\nof p-bromochlorobenzene. Analogous\nlines in p-chloronitrobenzene are much\nwider, that it is difficult to explain only\npresence of statistical clutter. This\nbroadening is saved and at 77\u041a.\nFor\nan\nexplanation\nof\nexperimental outcomes calculations of\nfrequencies of the lattice oscillations of\nstudied chips have been led. Interacting\nbetween molecules was presented on a\nmethod atom - atom of potentials [4].\nMolecular composition was accepted\nabsolutely hard. The frequency\nspectrum was on a method the Dyne\n[5]. The bar graphs gained at\ncalculations, show probability of\nmanifestation of spectral lines in the\nselected frequent interval.\nFrom the analysis of the\nexperimental and calculated spectrums\nit is discovered, that six intensive lines\nin a spectrum of the mixed chip are\nlinked to orientation oscillations. Lines\nof\np-chloronitrobenzene\nwith\n\nB\n\nB\n\nfrequencies of 24.5 and 34.0 cm-1 are\ncaused by oscillations basically around\nof an axis with the greatest moment of\ninertia. Lines of 30.0 and 47.5 cm-1\nwith an average, and lines of 63.5 and\n70.0 cm-1 with the least moment of\ninertia.\nAs have shown scalings the\nvalue of scatter of frequencies it is\nlinked to that for what oscillations\ncalculation is led. The greatest scatter\nof frequencies is observed for lines\nlinked with oscillations around of an\naxis with the greatest moment of inertia\nand the least with the least moment of\ninertia. On the average for scatter of\nfrequencies of p-bromochlorobenzene\nlinked to statistical clutter concerning\nparasubstitution halogens makes about\n2-3 cm-1. For p-chloronitrobenzene of\n3-5 cm-1 that does not explain the\nsignificant line broadening in a\nspectrum\nof\nsmall\nfrequencies.\nTherefore calculations in view of not\nonly\nstatistical\nclutter\nof\nparasubstitution benzol, but also in\nview of statistical clutter on rotational\ndisplacements of the nitrogroup around\nof axis C-N have been led. The scatter\nof frequencies has made from 3 up to\n10 cm-1 depending on the given clutter.\nThe value of this scatter will already\nagree with experimental data.\nThus, Raman spectrums of\n\n\fsmall\nfrequencies\nof\npchloronitrobenzene are similar to the\nanalogous polarized spectrums of pure\np-dibromobenzene and statistically\n\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\npbromochlorobenzene that confirms Xray\ndiffraction\ndata\nabout\ncrystallization of these substances in\nthe same space group. In a spectrum it\nis discovered six intensive lines linked\nwith orientation oscillations. The line\n\nbroadening in p-bromochlorobenzene is\nlinked to statistical clutter in layout of\nmolecules concerning parasubstitution\nbenzol. The registration only it\ncondition\nin\ncase\nof\npchloronitrobenzene does not explain the\nsignificant broadening of analogous\nlines. For correct interpretation it is\nnecessary to consider and statistical\nclutter in rotational displacements of\nthe nitro of group concerning axis C-N.\n\nReferences\n1.\n\nJ. C. Bellow, G. N.
