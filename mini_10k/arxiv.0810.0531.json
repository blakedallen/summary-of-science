It is known that the magnetic and electronic properties of these heterostructures depend on the nature of the metal/semiconductor\ninterface, which affects their magnetotransport properties in a significant way2 .\nFor example, M. Eddrief et al3 have recently shown in photoemission experiments that the\nFe \u22061 spin-up band along the (001) direction, which is the band that couples most efficiently\nto the ZnSe complex bands in Fe/ZnSe (001) magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)4 , is strongly\nmodified due to Zn interdiffusion into the Fe electrodes, and that these modifications may be\nthe origin of the very low tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measured in these systems.\nOn the theoretical side, M. Freyss et al5 have shown that the spin polarization PS =(Nup \u2212\nNdn )/ (Nup + Ndn ) (being Nup/dn the density of states of the majority/minority electrons) at\nthe Fermi level of Fe/ZnSe (001) interfaces is more negative for the Zn-terminated interface\nthan for the Se-terminated interface, and the transport calculations on Fe/ZnSe (001) singlebarrier junctions done by H. C. Herper et al6 clearly indicate that the TMR is higher for\nSe-terminated interfaces than for Zn-terminated ones. These examples concerning Fe/ZnSe\nhybrid nanostructures, together with those of Ref.2 for other hybrid junctions, demonstrate\nthat the metal/barrier interfaces play a major role in determining the magnetotransport\nproperties of MTJs.\nIn this contribution, we analyse the transport properties of some examples of Fe/ZnSe\n(001) double-barrier tunnel junctions (DMTJs) as compared to MTJs, as a function of\ninterface termination. To do this, we calculate the conductances and the TMR of epitaxial\nFe/ZnSe (001) tunnel junctions with two different interface structures: (a) Zn-terminated\n(both interfaces contain Fe and Zn atoms), and (b) Se-terminated (both interfaces contain\nFe and Se atoms). The results obtained could be relevant for the practical use of MTJs and\nof DMTJs in spintronic devices.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nSYSTEMS UNDER STUDY AND CALCULATION METHODS\n\nOur single-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions consist of n layers of zincblende ZnSe (001)\nsandwiched by two BCC Fe (001) semi-infinite electrodes. We form DMTJs by inserting\nm layers of BCC Fe (001) in between the 2n layers of ZnSe, so that the Fe midlayers are\nsandwiched by n identical ZnSe layers at each side. In what follows, we will call the active\nregion (AR) to whatever is sandwiched by the left and right semi-infinite Fe electrodes.\nEach ZnSe layer and Fe midlayer has a width of 0.567 nm and 0.287 nm, respectively. The\njunctions are periodic in the x-y plane, being z the transport direction. Fig. 1 shows, as\nan example, the interface structure of a Zn-terminated MTJ with n=1. The Se-terminated\njunctions are formed by interchanging the Zn and the Se atoms. We note that the junctions\nare epitaxial and that interface relaxation is not taken into account.\nIn the parallel configuration (P ), the magnetizations of all the magnetic regions are\nparallel to each other. In the antiparallel configuration (AP ), in MTJs the electrodes'\nmagnetizations are antiparallel to each other, while in DMTJs they remain parallel to each\nother and the Fe midlayer's magnetization is antiparallel. We note that, since the coercive\nfields of the electrodes and of the midlayer are different, these magnetic configurations are\nexperimentally achievable7 .\nThe electronic structure of the junctions is modeled by a second nearest neighbors spd\ntight-binding Hamiltonian fitted to ab initio band structure calculations for bulk Fe and\nbulk ZnSe8 . When forming the junctions, the ZnSe tight-binding on-site energies are rigidly\nshifted to make the Fe Fermi level fall 1.1 eV below its conduction band minimum, as\nindicated in photoemission experiments performed on Fe/ZnSe junctions9 . Further details\ncan be found in10 .\nThe ballistic conductances \u0393 are calculated using Landauer's formalism expressed in terms\nof Green's functions (see10,11 ). The self-energies describing the influence of the electrodes\non the active region are calculated from the electrodes' surface Green's functions (SGFs) in\nthe usual way11 , while the SGFs are obtained using the semi-analytical method described\nin12 . The tunneling magnetoresistance coefficient is defined as TMR=100\u00d7(\u0393P \u2212 \u0393AP )/\u0393P ,\nwhere \u0393P and \u0393AP are the conductances in the P and in the AP magnetic configurations,\nrespectively. With this definition, the TMR ranges from \u2212\u221e to 100 %. By calculating \u0393\nusing different numbers of parallel-to-the-interface wavevectors k// = kx x\u0302 + ky \u0177 (see Fig.\n3\n\n\f1), we find that 5000 is enough to reach convergence. More details on the method used to\ncalculate conductances can be found in10 .\nIn this work, we restrict ourselves to zero temperature, to infinitesimal bias voltage and to\nthe coherent regime (see Ref.11 ). We assume that the electron's k// and spin are conserved\nduring tunneling, since the junctions are epitaxial and the Fe midlayer is thin (< 1.8 nm)\nand ordered.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFig. 2 shows the tunneling magnetoresistance of Se- and of Zn-terminated MTJs with n=2\n(1.13 nm), and of DMTJs with n=2 and m=6 (1.72 nm), as a function of energy (referred\nto the Fermi level EF ). For single-barrier junctions, it is seen that the Se-terminated MTJ\nhas a large TMR, near 80 % on the average, while the Zn-terminated MTJ has a much\nlower one of 40 %, in qualitative agreement with the results of6 . For both terminations, the\ndependence of the TMR on energy is rather smooth.\nFor double-barrier junctions, it is seen that the DMTJs' TMR versus energy behaviors\nare quite different for each termination. The Se-terminated double junction shows an almost\nconstant TMR enhancement of 20 % with respect to the MTJ, except for certain energies at\nwhich the TMR drops abruptly. The TMR of the Zn-terminated DMTJ is also, in general,\nlarger than the corresponding MTJ, but the TMR versus energy behavior is not as smooth\nas in the Se-terminated DMTJ.\nThe TMR versus energy behavior shown in Fig. 2 can be understood from Figs. 3 and\n4, where we show the conductances in the P and AP configurations of MTJs (with n=2)\nand of DMTJs (with n=2 and m=6) with Se termination (Fig. 3) and with Zn termination\n(Fig. 4). From the lower panel of Fig. 3 (Se-terminated DMTJ) it can be observed the\nAP conductance resonance which produces the TMR drop at E = EF \u22120.05 eV shown in\nFig. 2. It can also be seen that the conductances exhibit an oscillatory behavior with\nenergy, indicating the presence of resonances. Going over to the lower panel of Fig. 4\n(Zn-terminated DMTJ) it is seen that the TMR drop at E = EF \u22120.1 eV does not have\nits origin in a resonance in the AP conductance but that it is due to a drop in the P\nmajority conductance. It is also interesting to note that the P majority conductance is a\nsmooth function of the energy (except for the already mentioned drop), in contrast to the\n4\n\n\fP majority conductance of the Se-terminated DMTJ, which shows two peaks for energies\nabove EF . These results suggest that, in the Zn-terminated DMTJ that we are considering,\nthe spin-up quantum well states of the Fe midlayer do not couple to the evanescent states\nin the semiconductor, while in the Se-terminated DMTJ they do couple.\nAnother interesting feature, that can be observed comparing the upper panels of Figs.\n3 and 4, is that the P minority resonance occurring in the Se-terminated MTJ (Fig. 3),\ndoes not appear in the Zn-terminated one (Fig. 4). This conductance peak is due to the\nresonant coupling of the well-known Fe spin-down interface states (which are pinned at\nEF +0.2 eV3 ) at each interface (see, for example, Refs.2,3,4,5 ). Since it is known that this\ninterface state is also present in the Zn-terminated Fe/ZnSe interfaces5 , our results indicate\nthat in the Zn-terminated junction the interface states at each side of the barrier do not\ncouple to each other, while in the Se-terminated case they do. We have checked that this P\nminority conductance peak is also present in the Se-terminated MTJ with n=4 (2.27 nm),\nbut that it is absent in the same MTJ with Zn termination. The P minority conductances\nof the Se- and of the Zn-terminated junctions with n=4 are shown in Fig. 5. Note that, as\nexpected, the conductance peak in the Se-terminated MTJ is not as sharp as that of the\none with n=2. We are at present investigating, from first principles, the origin of these two\nbehaviors, namely the absence of P minority and of P majority conductance peaks in the\nZn-terminated MTJs and DMTJs, respectively.\nContinuing with the analysis of DMTJs, we show in Table 1 the TMR values, evaluated\nat EF and at EF \u00b10.05 eV, of DMTJs with n=2 (1.13 nm) and different values of m, and\nof the MTJs with n=2 (and m=0), for the two different interface terminations considered.\nIt is seen that, in general, the TMR values of the Se-terminated DMTJs are positive and\nrather large (the maximum is 98.9 %), while the ones corresponding to the Zn-terminated\nDMTJs are either positive (but not so large) or negative and very large (reaching \u2212639 %).\nThese features may result in a more pronounced bias voltage dependence of the TMR in\nZn-terminated DMTJs than in Se-terminated ones, although further studies are desirable.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nUsing a realistic model for the electronic structure and accurate conductance calculations\nin the coherent, zero bias and ballistic regime, we showed that the spin-dependent transport\n5\n\n\fm\n\nZn-terminated\n\nSe-terminated\n\n0 (n=2)\n\n21.1/29.8/40.9 (30.6)\n\n66.3/73.3/67 (68.9)\n\n2\n\n\u2212639/\u221288.8/27.5 (\u2212233.4) \u221266.1/67.3/87.8 (29.7)\n\n4\n\n69.6/\u221298.9/36.2 (2.3)\n\n92.9/95.9/98.9 (95.9)\n\n6\n\n67/31.4/65.4 (54.6)\n\n33.5/87.7/90.9 (70.7)\n\nTABLE I: TMR values evaluated at EF and at EF \u00b10.05 eV of DMTJs with n=2 (1.13 nm) and\ndifferent values of m, together with those of the MTJ with n=2 (and m=0), for two different\ninterface structures. TMR values are given in % and refer to EF \u22120.05 eV/EF /EF +0.05 eV. The\nnumber in brackets is the TMR value averaged over the three energies considered.\n\nproperties of Fe/ZnSe (001) single- and double-barrier tunnel junctions are very sensitive to\nthe Fe/ZnSe interface structure. In particular, we found that in the Se-terminated singlebarrier junctions considered, the conductance of minority electrons has a peak that is absent\nin the Zn-terminated junctions, indicating that in the latter case the Fe spin-down interface\nstates at each side of the ZnSe barrier do not couple to each other. We also found that\nthe tunneling magnetoresistance of double-barrier junctions reaches higher values in the Seterminated double junctions than in the Zn-terminated ones, in which case the TMR can\nreach very large and negative values.\nThis work was partially funded by UBACyT-X115, Fundaci\u00f3n Antorchas, PICT 03-10698\nand PIP-Conicet 6016.
