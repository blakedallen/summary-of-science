The magnetic fields in the foreshock of supernova remnant shocks can be amplified substantially and electrons can be\ninjected into the diffusive acceleration, if strongly magnetised plasma subshells are present in the foreshock, with velocities an order\nof magnitude faster than the main shell.\nKey words. acceleration of particles, methods: \u2013 numerical, plasmas\n\n1. Introduction\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) emanate energetic electromagnetic\nradiation, which demonstrates the acceleration of electrons to\nultrarelativistic speeds (Tanimori et al. 1998; Uchiyama et al.\n2007) and the generation or amplification of magnetic fields\n(Ellison & Vladimirov 2008; Volk et al. 2005). The likely origin\nof the accelerated electrons and of the strong magnetic fields is\nthe SNR shock (Marcowith et al. 2006; Pelletier et al. 2006).\nThe nonrelativistic expansion speed of the main SNR blast\nshell (Kulkarni et al. 1998; Fransson et al. 2002) and the weak\nmagnetic field of the ambient medium (Volk et al. 2005), into\nwhich this shell is expanding, are obstacles to the magnetic field\namplification by plasma instabilities and to the electron acceleration out of the thermal plasma distribution to moderately\nrelativistic energies. Such an acceleration is needed for their\ninjection (Cargill & Papadopoulos 1988; Kirk & Dendy 2001;\nKuramitsu & Krasnoselskikh 2005a,b) into the diffusive shock\nacceleration process (See Drury (1983)) so that they can cross\n\nthe shock transition layer repeatedly. Electrostatic instabilities\ndominate for nonrelativistic flows in unmagnetized plasmas\n(Bret et al. 2008; Bret 2009) and they can neither accelerate the\nelectrons to highly relativistic speeds (Sircombe et al. 2006) nor\namplify the magnetic fields.\nThe electrons could be accelerated by plasma based\ncharged particle accelerators (Bingham et al. 2004), by\nelectron surfing acceleration (Katsouleas & Dawson 1983;\nOhira & Takahara 2007; Dieckmann et al. 2008a), double\nlayers (Raadu & Rasmussen 1988; Dieckmann & Bret 2009)\nor by processes that exploit a velocity shear in the plasma\noutflow (Rieger & Duffy 2006). It has, however, not yet been\ndemonstrated with multi-dimensional and self-consistent simulations that these mechanisms can indeed achieve the required\nelectron acceleration and magnetic field amplification. The\nnon-relativistic shocks, which are found between the main SNR\nblast shell and the ambient medium, can also probably not\ntransfer significant energy from the ions to the electrons and\naccelerate the latter to relativistic speeds (Hoshino & Shimada\n\n\f2\n\nM. E. Dieckmann et al.: 2D PIC simulation of an oblique shock\n\n2002; Lembege et al. 2004; Scholer & Matsukiyo 2004;\nChapman et al. 2005; Sorasio et al. 2006; Amano & Hoshino\n2007; Umeda et al. 2009).\nA viable acceleration mechanism may develop ahead of\nthe main SNR shock, if we find subshells that outrun the\nmain blast shell. These subshells may move faster than the\ntypical peak speed of 0.2c of the main shell. An expansion\nspeed as high as 0.9c may have been observed for a subshell ejected by the supernova SN1998bw (Kulkarni et al. 1998).\nMost supernovae are less violent and their subshells are probably slower. The density of the subshell plasma is well below that of the main blast shell and its dynamics will be influenced to a larger extent by the upstream magnetic field than\nthe dynamics of the latter. This is true in particular, if the\nupstream magnetic field has been pre-amplified by the cosmic rays (Winske & Leroy 1984; Bell 2004; Reville et al. 2007;\nNiemiec et al. 2008; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009). A fast magnetized shock would form in the foreshock of the main SNR\nshock that can result in a stronger magnetic field amplification\nand electron acceleration.\nWe examine with a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation the formation of a shock in a plasma, in which a strong guiding magnetic field is quasi-parallel to the plasma expansion direction.\nWhistler waves, which become Alfv\u00e9n waves at low frequencies, occuring at such shocks can be efficient electron accelerators (Levinson 1992; Kuramitsu & Krasnoselskikh 2005a,b;\nMiteva & Mann 2007; McClements & Fletcher 2009). Whistlers\nand Alfv\u00e9n waves are circulary polarized if they propagate parallel to the guiding magnetic field. We briefly summarize their\nproperties and focus on the low-frequency modes with a lefthand polarization. These modes are qualitatively similar to the\nquasi-parallel propagating ones we consider here. A more thorough description of the dispersion relation of two-fluid waves\nand the shift of the resonance frequencies for quasi-parallel\npropagation can be found elsewhere (Treumann & Baumjohann\n1997).\nThe dominant waves, which we will observe, grow in a\nplasma with an electron gyrofrequency that exceeds the plasma\nfrequency. As we increase the frequency in such a strongly magnetized plasma towards the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves with a left-hand circular polarization become dispersive.\nThese waves resonate with the ions and their frequencies remain\nbelow the ion cyclotron frequency. Alfv\u00e9n modes with a lefthand circular polarization just below the ion cyclotron frequency\nare called ion whistlers. Whistlers are predominantly electromagnetic for small propagation angles relative to the guiding\nmagnetic field, as it has been discussed for high-frequency ones\nby (Tokar & Gary 1985), and if they have low wavenumbers.\nIon whistlers or dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves develop a field-aligned\nelectric field component close to the resonance frequency, by\nwhich they can interact nonlinearly with the plasma particles\nand accelerate them (McClements & Fletcher 2009). Any wave\ngrowth will furthermore result in an increasing energy density of\nthe magnetic field.\nAlfv\u00e9n waves and other magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nwaves can grow to amplitudes, at which they start to interact\nnonlinearly with the plasma (Stasiewicz & Ekeberg 2008). Short\nLarge Amplitude Magnetic Field Structures (SLAMS) are nonlinear MHD waves occuring at quasi-parallel shocks and may be\nrelevant for our simulation. The SLAMS can be efficient electron accelerators (Mann & Classen 1997). Their magnetic amplitude reaches several times that of the background field and\nthey can propagate with a super-Alfv\u00e9nic speed, because they\nconvect with the ions (Mann et al. 1994; Behlke et al. 2003).\n\nSLAMS have also been observed in simulations (Scholer et al.\n2003). The acceleration of electrons by sub-structures of quasiparallel shocks, which may be SLAMS, has been observed in the\nsolar corona (Mann et al. 1998).\nThe absence of self-consistent kinetic models of oblique\nshocks implies that they can currently be studied only numerically with particle-in-cell (PIC) (Dawson 1983; Eastwood 1991)\nor with Vlasov simulations (Arber & Vann 2002; Sircombe et al.\n2006). The pioneering PIC simulations of plasma slabs, which\ncollide with a speed of 0.9c and in the presence of an oblique\nmagnetic field (Bessho & Ohsawa 1999; Zindo et al. 2005),\nhave evidenced the formation of a shock that accelerated the\nelectrons to ultrarelativistic speeds and amplified the magnetic\nfield. A more recent PIC simulation study (Dieckmann et al.\n2008b) has shown, that the shock formation is triggered by\nan energetic electromagnetic structure (EES). The simulation\ncould demonstrate that an approximate equipartition of the ion,\nelectron and magnetic energy densities is established. However,\nthese simulations could only resolve one spatial dimension due\nto computer constraints, which is not necessarily realistic for\nmildly relativistic collision speeds.\nWe perform here a case study with initial conditions, which\nare similar to those employed by Dieckmann et al. (2008b). We\nreduce the collision speed to 0.5c and lower the temperature.\nThe plasma cloud representing the subshell is ten times denser\nthan the plasma cloud that represents the ambient plasma (interstellar medium), into which the shell expands. A guiding magnetic field is quasi-parallel to the plasma flow velocity vector\nand it results in an electron gyrofrequency that equals the electron plasma frequency of the dense cloud. These bulk plasma parameters have been selected with the intention to enforce a planar shock front (Hededal & Nishikawa 2005; Bret et al. 2006;\nDieckmann et al. 2008b), by which we can model the shock in\none- or two-dimensions in space. The reduced ion-to-electron\nmass ratio we use allows us to model this collision in form of\na 2(1/2)D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, which resolves two\nspatial and three momentum dimensions.\nOur results are summarized as follows: We find higherdimensional structures (density filaments), which initially form\nat the front of the tenuous plasma cloud and expand in time. The\nfront of the dense cloud, which turns out to be the most relevant structure, remains planar and its filamentation is delayed\nbut not suppressed by the guiding magnetic field and the high\ntemperature. An EES grows ahead of the dense plasma cloud\nbefore it has become filamentary and the magnetic amplitude of\nthe EES reaches a value several times the one of the initial guiding magnetic field. The EES is pushed by the dense cloud and its\nphase speed in the rest frame of the tenuous cloud is comparable to the cloud collision speed or twice the Alfv\u00e9n speed in the\ntenuous cloud. The front of the EES expands at an even higher\nspeed. Its high speed and amplitude may imply that the EES is\na SLAMS. The front of the dense cloud and, consequently, the\nEES are slowed down by the electromagnetic wave-particle interaction. It is thus not possible to define a rest frame moving\nwith a constant speed, in which the EES is stationary. This would\nbe necessary to measure the frequency of the EES accurately.\nHowever, the amplitude distribution of the EES suggests that\nits oscillation frequency is below the ion cyclotron frequency.\nElectromagnetic waves are destabilized by the EES ahead of the\ncloud overlap layer through what we think is a four-wave interaction (Goldstein 1978). The electrons are accelerated in the\ncombined wave fields of these waves and in the forming shock to\nhighly relativistic speeds. The simulation shows though that the\nstrongest electron acceleration occurs at the position, where the\n\n\fM. E.

The plasma collision results in a substantial electron acceleration and also in an amplification of the magnetic energy density by one order of magnitude\nwithin the EES and the forming shock. Both values are probably\nlimited by the reduced ion mass of 400 electron masses, which\nwe must employ. Radiative processes, which are not resolved\nby the PIC code, will at this stage start to influence the shock\nevolution (Schlickeiser & Lerche 2007, 2008) and we stop the\nsimulation.\nThis paper is structured as follows.

The Alfv\u00e9n speed in cloud 2 is VA \u2248 0.23 in units\nof c and the collision has an initial Alfv\u00e9n Mach number \u2248 2.\nThe \u03b2 = 2\u03bc0 (ne1 + ni1 )kB T/B20 = 0.2, where T is given in units\nof Kelvin, and the plasma is strongly magnetized. However, in\nthe box frame of reference, the average kinetic energy density\nof the plasma exceeds the magnetic energy density by the factor\n8.4 and the kinetic energy thus still dominates.\nTypical particle number densities of the ambient interstellar medium, into which the plasma subshell would expand, are 0.1 cm\u22123 < n0 < 1.0 cm\u22123 (Acero et al. 2007;\nEllison & Vladimirov 2008). This ambient medium would correspond to the cloud 2. These densities are not always known,\nthey change as a function of space and are not the same for all\nSNRs. We will thus use normalized units that permit us to scale\nthe simulation results to any n0 .\nVariables in physical units are denoted by the subscript\np. The time and space are scaled to t = \u03a9e1 t p and x =\n\u03bb\u22121\ns x p , where \u03bb s = c/\u03a9e1 is the electron skin depth of cloud\n1. The ion skin depth equals 20\u03bb s for the considered ion-toelectron mass ratio. The electric and magnetic fields are scaled to\nE p (\u03bb s x) = \u03a9e1 cme e\u22121 E(x) and B p (\u03bb s x) = \u03a9e1 me e\u22121 B(x). The\ncharge, the particle number density and the current are normalized as \u03c1 p (\u03bb s x) = ene1 \u03c1(x), n p (\u03bb s x) = ne1 n(x) and J p (\u03bb s x) =\nene1 cJ(x). The normalized Maxwell's equations are\n\u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\n\n2. Initial conditions and simulation method\nWe model the collision of two plasma clouds. Each cloud consists of co-moving and equally dense electron and ion species.\nThis system is sketched in Fig. 1. The dense species represents\nin this model a fast subshell of the SNR blast shell and the tenuous species the ambient medium.\nThe number densities of the electrons with the charge \u2212e and\nmass me of the dense cloud 1 and of the tenuous cloud 2 are ne1\nand ne2 = ne1 /10. The number densities of the ions with the\ncharge and mass e and mi of cloud 1 and 2 are ni1 = ne1 and\nni2 = ne2 . The cloud 1 occupies the half space x < x0 and the\ncloud 2 occupies x > x0 . Both clouds collide at the initial contact\nboundary, which we set to x0 = 0. All four species are initialized in their respective rest frame with a relativistic Maxwellian\ndistribution that has the temperature T = 25 keV. This value exceeds by far the temperature of the ambient medium (ISM) into\nwhich the blast shell expands, which is typically less than 1eV.\nThe upstream temperature may, however, be increased by the interaction of the ISM with the cosmic ray precursor of the main\nblast shell. The temperature T is also higher than that downstream of the SNR shock, which is usually a few keV. The purpose of selecting this high temperature of the simulation plasma\nis to improve the numerical efficiency. It maximizes the grid cell\nsize, which must be comparable to the plasma Debye length, and\nthe time step that is connected to the cell size, while it ensures\nthat no highly relativistic particles are present to start with.\n\n3\n\n\u2202B\n, \u2207 * B = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202E\n+ J , \u2207 * E = \u03c1.\n(2)\n\u2202t\nA PIC code solves the Klimontovich-Dupree equations (Dupree\n1963) that are derived from the Vlasov equation with the help of\nthe method of characteristics.

The charge\nqr and mass mr of the CP are given in units of e and me and\nthe momentum is normalized to me c. The macroscopic current J\nis obtained from interpolating the current contributions of each\nCP to the grid and from the summation of these interpolating\ncurrents over all particles. The macroscopic J is used to evolve\nE and B one step in time. The momentum p j of each CP with\nindex j is then updated with these new electromagnetic fields,\nwhich are interpolated to the position x j of the respective CP.\nInterpolation schemes are discussed by Dawson (1983) and the\none our code uses by Eastwood (1991).\nOur code is relativistic and electromagnetic and we use periodic boundary conditions in all directions.

The shock is forming at the later time T sim and we\ndetermine the plasma state that is reached by the release of the\nion kinetic energy.\n3.1. Early simulation time\n\nFigure 2 displays the fields at the time T 1 . The spatial interval\n\u2212300 < x < 300, in which the clouds overlap by vb T 1 \u2248 300,\nshows filamentary structures in B x, Bz and Ey . We discuss these\nfirst. The filamentation instability separates the currents due to\nboth interpenetrating clouds and a current system develops in\nthe simulation plane. It drives the Bz, which gives rise to the\nEy through linear (Tzoufras et al. 2006) and nonlinear processes\n(Dieckmann et al. 2009). The Bz is modulated along y with a\nwavelength between 5\u03bb s and 20\u03bb s, the latter being equal to the\nion skin depth. At least the largest structures of Bz seem to be\ntied to ion filaments.\nInitially the convection electric field along y ensures that the\nmagnetic field is co-moving with the plasma. The gyrocenters of\nthe plasma particles do not move relative to B0 and no net current is present. Once the plasma clouds overlap, there will be a\nnet particle motion relative to B0 and the plasma particles can\nbe deflected into the y, z-plane. The derivative along z vanishes\nin our 2D PIC simulation. The B x can only be generated through\n\u2202 x By \u2212 \u2202y B x = \u2202t Ez + Jz , which causes structure formation in\nB x and By . Figure 2(a) reveals that the filamentation of B x due\nto such currents is strongest close to the front of cloud 2, that\nis for x < 0.

Cloud 1 occupies the x-interval \u2212L x /2 < x < 0, while cloud 2 occupies\n0 < x < L x /2. No new particles are introduced at the boundaries. The clouds convect away from the initial contact boundary\nat x = 0 with the speed modulus vb and the simulation is stopped\nbefore the rear boundaries of the clouds enter the area of interest.\nEach plasma species is represented by 160 CPs per cell. The\ndensity difference of both clouds thus implies a lower weight\nfor the CPs of cloud 2. We employ a mass ratio mi /me = 400\nand let the simulation run for the duration T sim = 3500. If no\nstrong instabilities develop, the particles could move on average\na distance vb T sim = 950.\n\n300\n\n400\n500\n600\n(b) X\u2212position: 4EY,BZ\n\n700\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of the planar electromagnetic fields along x\nfor y = 0. (a) compares cBz with cBy in units of cB x,0, while (b)\ncompares cBz with 4Ey in the same normalization.\n\nfilamentation but one has to keep in mind that the apparent relative weakness of the modulations of By compared to those of B x\nis influenced by the different colour scales. The fluctuations of\nE x in the interval \u2212300 < x < 300 have no visible counterpart\nin By and Bz . The polarization of the electric field fluctuations\nalong vb suggests a charge density wave, but their correlation\nwith the small-scale fluctuations of B x for \u2212300 < x < \u2212100\ndemonstrates that they are not purely electrostatic.\nThe dominant fields of the energetic electromagnetic structure (EES) are observed in Fig. 2 ahead of the dense cloud 1\nfor x > 300. The EES is planar. The field amplitudes along y, z\nare practically constant along y. The By and Bz in Figs. 2(b,c)\nreach peak amplitudes exceeding that of the guiding magnetic\nfield in this interval. The E x and B x at x \u2248 300 show an oblique\nmodulation.\nWe exploit the planarity and constancy as a function of y\nof the amplitudes of By , Bz and Ey for x > 250, where we find\nthe EES. Figure 3 plots these amplitudes as a function of x for\ny = 0. The considered field components have their peak values\nat the front of cloud 1 located at x \u2248 300. The amplitudes decrease exponentially for x < 300 and By and Bz reveal a phase\nshift of 180\u25e6. The amplitudes of By , Bz and Ey decrease also\nfor increasing x > 300, although more slowly and the fields oscillate. The phases of By and Bz are shifted by \u2248 90\u25e6 in this\ninterval and the EES is predominantly circularly polarized. The\nelectron gyrofrequency is comparable to the plasma frequency\n\n\fM.

The\nelectrons of cloud 1 are shown in (a) and those of cloud 2 in (b).\n\nfor x < 300 and significantly larger for x > 300. The jump in the\nratio of the characteristic resonance frequencies at x \u2248 300 will\nalter the wave dispersive properties of the plasma, explaining the\nqualitative change the fields of the EES undergo as we cross this\nboundary.\nThe By and Bz of the EES have a left-hand polarization for\nx > 300. Consider a coordinate system defined by x, By and Bz .\nThe By has a maximum at x \u2248 340, where Bz = 0. As we go to\nincreasing values of x, the amplitude of By decreases and that of\nBz becomes negative. The magnetic field vector rotates counterclockwise. A deviation from a circular polarization is provided\nby Bz,0 , 0 and by E x , 0, but their amplitudes are relatively\nlow compared to By and Bz for 300 < x < 600.\nThe Bz is almost in phase with Ey . The comparison of By with\nEy and the comparison of Bz with Ez for x > 300 would show\nthat they are shifted by \u2248 90\u25e6 , while By is shifted by 180\u25e6 relative to Ez . Figure 2 shows this most clearly at x \u2248 500. The wave\ncomponents E\u22a5 = (0, Ey , Ez ) and B\u22a5 = (0, By, Bz) perpendicular to vb can thus be connected through E\u22a5 \u2248 \u2212vb \u00d7 B\u22a5 , where\nwe assume that vb k x. The EES and its magnetic field is thus\nconvecting with the plasma of cloud 1. The wavelength of E x in\nFig. 2 along x equals that of all field components except B x for\nx > 300. Since all components of E are strong, the EES has an\nelectric field component aligned with B0 . The EES has the wavelength \u03bbW \u2248 120\u03bb s, coinciding with \u03bbW \u2248 2\u03c0(mi /me )1/2 \u03bb s . This\n\u03bbW , together with a convection of the EES with the vb of cloud\n1, points at a connection of the EES to phase space structures in\nthe ion distribution, which is typical for SLAMS (Behlke et al.\n2003).\nThe magnetic oscillations observed in Fig. 2 in the spatial\ninterval \u2212300 < x < 300, in which both clouds overlap, must be\ntied to currents. The currents originate from a spatial redistribution of the plasma cloud particles and the latter can be examined\nwith the help of the density distributions of the four plasma populations.\nFigure 4 displays the densities of the ions of cloud 1 and\nof cloud 2. The ion density of cloud 1 has a peak at x \u2248 300.\nThis high-density structure is planar and shows no signs of filamentation along y. The filamented front of cloud 2 at x \u2248 \u2212300\nshows no high-density structure. The ion densities of both clouds\nare only strongly modulated well behind the expansion front of\n\ncloud 1. Modulations of the density of cloud 1 of up to 40% are\nobserved for \u2212200 < x < 0 and the density of cloud 2 is modulated even stronger for \u2212300 < x < 0. Weaker modulations of\nboth ion clouds extend up to x \u2248 200 and their wavelength decreases with increasing x. The filaments of both ion clouds are\naligned with the x-axis in the interval \u2212250 < x < \u2212100. The\nion density of cloud 1 is highest at y \u2248 0 and lowest at y \u2248 10,\nwhile the density of cloud 2 shows the opposite behaviour. The\nions of both clouds and their currents are spatially separated, as\nexpected. The ion filamentation takes place on the same scale as\nthe oscillations of Bz in Fig. 2(c) in the same interval, reinforcing\ntheir connection. The ion density modulation of cloud 2 oblique\nto the x-axis in the interval \u2212300 < x < \u2212250 is not balanced by\nthe ions of cloud 1.\nIt is remarkable that the amplitude of Bz in the interval\n\u2212300 < x < 0, which displays the strongest ion filamentation,\nis an order of magnitude lower than that of the EES. The latter\nmust thus have a different origin.\nFigure 5 shows the density distributions of the electrons of\ncloud 1 and 2. The electrons of cloud 1 accumulate at x \u2248 300\nand their density is modulated on scales of an ion skin depth in\nthe interval \u2212300 < x < 0. Similar structures are revealed by the\nelectron density of cloud 2 in this interval. These patterns follow\nclosely those of the ions in Fig. 4, which is at least partially enforced by the need to satisfy the quasi-neutrality of the plasma.\nThis is evidenced, for example, by the electrons of cloud 1 for\n\u2212300 < x < \u2212250. Their density shows the same oblique striping as the ion density of cloud 2 in Fig. 4(b). The density maxima of the ions of cloud 2 and of the electrons of cloud 1, as well\nas their minima, follow each other closely in this interval. It is\nthe electrons, rather than the ions of cloud 1, which compensate\nthe net ion charge in this interval. Another consequence of the\nquasi-neutrality is seen at the front of cloud 1, where the electrons reach a high density. This density peak is well-defined and\nconfined to a narrow x-interval, despite the high thermal electron\nspeed, which should rapidly disperse them. The high ion density\nin this interval provides the confinement. In contrast, the cloud\n2 shows no ion density enhancement in Fig. 4(b) at its front at\nx \u2248 \u2212300. Consequently, the electrons of cloud 2 are spread out\nalong x and the fastest electrons have reached an x < \u2212500.\n\n\f6\n\nM. E.

Electron densities at the time T 1 close to the front of cloud\n1 and normalized to ne1 . The electrons of cloud 1 are shown in\n(a) and those of cloud 2 in (b).\n\nThe ions and electrons of cloud 2 in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b)\nshow patterns in their density ahead of cloud 1 for x > 300.\nThese patterns resemble those in B x and E x at x \u2248 300 in Fig. 2.\nThe box width along y upstream of cloud 1 is approximately one\nion skin depth of cloud 2, because ni1 /ni2 = 10. The structures\njust ahead of x = 300 perform two oscillations along y. These are\npotentially filaments, but they cannot be caused by the interaction of cloud 1 and 2 because they are outside the cloud overlap\nlayer. The spatial modulation provides a hint. The filament starting at x \u2248 300 and y \u2248 30 in Fig. 5(b) changes the value of y,\nat which the density is highest, continuously as a function of x.\nOne oscillation takes place on a distance \u2248 120 along x, which\nis the wavelength \u03bbW of the EES.\nThe electrons of cloud 2 in Fig. 5(b) close to the front of the\ncloud 1 at x \u2248 300 are also modulated on a smaller scale, which\nis already evident from Fig. 5. Figure 6 concentrates on this interval. Filaments can be seen with a thickness ranging from \u03bb s to\nabout 5\u03bb s close to x \u2248 280 and they have vanished already a few\ntens of \u03bb s behind the front of cloud 1. Their size and even more\nso their short lifetime due to a rapid thermalization indicates that\nthese structures are caused by a filamentation of the electrons.\nFigure 4(b) confirms this, because the large ion filaments form\nfar behind the front of cloud 1, implying that the ions have not\nbeen thermalized by their passage through the interval depicted\nby Fig. 6.\nThe densities of the four species in Fig. 7 are integrated over\ny. The plasma density of cloud 1 reaches 1.5 times its initial\nvalue at its front at x \u2248 300 and it rapidly vanishes for further\nincreasing x. No ions of cloud 1 and almost none of its electrons\nhave thus propagated upstream of its front. The plasma density\nof cloud 2 is almost constant for x > 300. The electron gyroradius in B\u22a5 is less than \u03bb s and they should fall behind the ions\nof cloud 2 once they encounter the EES. One may expect that\nthe electrons of cloud 2 accumulate at this position, this is however not seen in Fig. 7. The absence of electrons of cloud 1 at\nthis position and the need to satisfy the plasma quasi-neutrality\ntransports the electrons of cloud 2 across B\u22a5 , which will accelerate these electrons orthogonally to x.\nThe ion density at the front of cloud 2 and the electron density of cloud 1 at x \u2248 \u2212300 are weakly enhanced.

(a) shows the\nelectron density and (b) that of the ions. The dashed curves correspond to the electrons and ions of the cloud 2 and their densities are multiplied by the factor 4.\ncreased densities are caused by the oblique structures in the interval \u2212300 < x < \u2212250 in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(a). The velocity\nvectors of the ions moving in the oblique filaments have been\ndeflected away from vb . This decreases their flow speed along x\nand the ions accumulate.\nThe electron densities of both clouds are nonuniform within\n\u2212600 < x < 300, evidencing their interactions through instabilities. The density dip of the electrons of cloud 2 for 250 <\nx < 300 coincides with the filamentary structures in the same\ninterval in Fig. 6, further evidencing that this dip is caused by an\nelectron filamentation instability without a significant involvement of the ions. A notable fraction of the electrons of cloud 2\nhave convected to x \u2248 \u2212600 and some even beyond that. The\ndensities of both ion clouds do not yet show a significant modulation, apart from the accumulation at x \u2248 300. The ions in the\nlayer within \u2212300 < x < 0 in Fig. 4 are only redistributed in the\nx, y-plane, but they do not accumulate along x through a shock\ncompression.\nThe interaction of the particles with the electromagnetic\nfields implies that their dynamics involves at least one spatial\nand three momentum dimensions. We display the phase space\nprojections, which we consider to be the most relevant ones. The\nion phase space density fi (x, p x ) can be used to determine if and\nwhen the shock forms. The ions of cloud 1 and 2 must merge to\nform the downstream region. The electron distribution fe (x, \u03b3)\nshows the range of Lorentz factors attained by the electrons.\nFigure 8 displays these distributions. The ions of cloud 1\nconvect practically freely. Only the tip of this cloud at x \u2248 300\nis modified. The electron gyrofrequency \u03c9ce = e|B0 |/me equals\n\u03a9e1 , with which we have normalized the time. The ions have gyrated T 1 /400 \u2248 \u03c0 or one half of a gyro-orbit in B0 until now.\nThe uniform B0 is, however, almost parallel to x and it cannot\ncause by itself the ion rotation at the front of cloud 1. The mag1/2\nnetic field B\u22a5 = (B2y + B2z ) of the EES exceeds B x,0 at the front\nof cloud 1. The ions will have gyrated by a significant angle in\nthis B\u22a5 , because the amplitude of the EES grows rapidly to a\nlarge amplitude. The EES also accelerates the electrons of cloud\n2 in the interval 300 < x < 500, which are transported across\nB\u22a5 by the ions of cloud 2. The ions of both clouds must provide\n\n\fM. E.

The greyscale denotes the base 10 logarithm of the density.\nthrough the EES the energy required to accelerate the electrons.\nThe modification of the ion phase space distribution can thus be\nattributed to the EES and to the electron acceleration.\nWeak oscillations of the mean momentum hp x i(x) can be\nseen in the ions of cloud 2 in the interval 300 < x < 600 in\nFig. 8. We can interpret them as follows. The ions of cloud 2\nupstream of cloud 1 move through the EES at the speed \u2248 \u2212vb\nin the box frame towards decreasing values of x. A strong circularly polarized magnetowave with a wavevector aligned with\nx would force the ions onto a circular path in the py , pz plane,\nin which the mean ion beam momenta hpy i(x) and hpz i(x) vary\nas a function of x with the wave's periodicity. Since Bz,0 is not\nnegligible, this motion must also modulate hp x i(x). Finally we\nsee that the ions of the tenuous cloud 2 have been heated up by\ntheir filamentation at the front of cloud 2 at x \u2248 \u2212300.\n3.2. Late simulation time\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we analyse now the simulation data\nat the time T sim = 3500, when we stop the simulation. If both\nbeams had streamed freely, they should have propagated on average the distance vb T sim \u2248 950.\nFigure 9 displays the densities of both ion clouds. The front\nof the ions of cloud 1 is located at x \u2248 750, which is well behind vb T sim \u2248 950. The ions of cloud 1 have thus been slowed\ndown and the peak density reaches a value \u2248 6 at x \u2248 750. This\nhigh-density structure is still planar, but its density is not constant as a function of y any more. It decreases to 4 at x \u2248 750\nand at y \u2248 40. The front of the ions of the cloud 2 is located\nat x \u2248 \u2212950, which equals the distance expected from the free\nstreaming of the ions. Both ion clouds reveal density modulations on a scale less or comparable to the ion skin depth. The\nlargest is found in the ions of cloud 2 at x \u2248 \u2212300 and the interval with a reduced density ranges from y \u2248 0 to y \u2248 30. The ions\nof cloud 2 also show structures in the density distribution for\nx > 750, which is outside the cloud overlap layer. The wavevector of these oscillations is parallel to x.\nMovie 1 shows the time evolution of the ion densities until the time T sim . We first discuss the filamentation in the cloud\noverlap layer. The filament formation is seen clearly, when each\ncloud has expanded by the distance 100 or for a time T 1 /3. The\n\n7\n\nFig. 9. (Colour online) Ion density distributions at the time T sim\nin units of ni1 . The ions of cloud 1 are shown in (a) and the ions\nof cloud 2 in (b).\nfilaments are asymmetric, a consequence of the unequal cloud\ndensities. The ions of cloud 2 show at this time and in the interval \u2212100 < x < 0 several filaments aligned with the x-axis.\nThe filaments have a constant density along y and a width \u2248 10.\nThese filaments are separated by intervals with a reduced density, which have a width of only a few \u03bb s . The latter have counterparts in the ions of cloud 1. The wave vector of these filaments\nis parallel to the y-axis at this time.\nWe also observe density fluctuations of the ions of cloud 2\nwith a wave vector along x, which develop first in the section\nof the cloud overlap layer with x < 0. This is an instability developing as the ions of cloud 2 propagate through the plasma of\ncloud 1. A Buneman-type instability (Buneman 1958) develops\nbetween the ions of cloud 2, which can be considered to form an\nunmagnetized beam on electron time scales, and the magnetized\nelectrons of cloud 1. The phase space density oscillations of the\nions of cloud 2 are periodic with a wave length \u03bb <\n\u223c 4\u03c0vb /\u03a9e1\n(not shown), which is typical for the Buneman instability involving hot electrons. The phase speed of the unstable wave is close\nto the speed of the ion beam, here composed of the ions of cloud\n2, turning it into a slow oscillation in its rest frame. The ions\ncan react to it and they will form phase space holes after a sufficiently long time. The ions of cloud 1 see the Buneman wave\nas a rapid oscillation to which they cannot react. This explains\nwhy the ions of cloud 2 in movie 1 at the time T 1 and the electrons in Fig. 5 show the density fluctuations, but not the ions of\ncloud 1 in movie 1. These charge density fluctuations give the\noscillations of E x along x in Fig. 2(d). The electrostatic fields\nprobably couple to B x, because the Buneman instability is not\npurely electrostatic in the presence of the strong oblique B0 .\nThe ion filaments are observed to move in time in the positive y-direction, when the clouds have expanded by the distance 100 along x. The flow pattern becomes complicated, when\ncloud 1 has expanded to x \u2248 400. The filaments in the interval\n0 < x < 300 still convect to increasing y, while the ion filaments\nof cloud 2 with x < 0 move in the opposite direction. We may\ninterpret this observation as follows. Only the ions in the cloud\noverlap layer are not co-moving with B0 , because we cannot define through the convection electric field a reference frame, in\nwhich the ions of both clouds are at rest. The ions in the cloud\n\n\f8\n\nM. E. Dieckmann et al.: 2D PIC simulation of an oblique shock\n\nFig. 10. (Colour online) Electron density distributions at the time\nT sim in units of ne1 . (a) displays the electrons of cloud 1 and (b)\nthe electrons of cloud 2.\noverlap layer rotate with a velocity amplitude set by their mean\nspeed relative to the rest frame of the overlap layer, rather than\nby their smaller thermal speed outside it.\nThe ions gyrate in the cloud overlap layer orthogonally to\nB0 in a plane that is almost parallel to the py , pz plane. The ions\nof cloud 1 and cloud 2 are counter-propagating and the magnetic field should deflect them into opposite directions. The Bz\nseparates the filaments of both ion clouds. This implies in a 2D\ngeometry that the filaments are locked as long as the magnetic\ntrapping force by Bz (Davidson et al. 1972) is stronger than the\nLorentz force due to B0 . A common direction of motion is established. The direction of motion that varies with x and later also\nwith y is probably tied to the ion gyro-phase. Movie 1 suggests\nat late times that the filaments of cloud 2 close to its front merge\nand separate again. The Bz is here insufficiently strong to separate the ion filaments in the x, y plane. The B0 , 0 introduces a\ncomplicated flow pattern in the 5D phase space spanned by x, y\nand by the three components of p. The filaments do probably not\nmerge in this high-dimensional space but they appear to do so in\nthe simulation plane.\nNow we turn towards the filaments upstream of cloud 1. As\nwe approach the time T 1 , when the clouds have expanded by the\ndistance 300 along x in the movie 1, the filaments in the cloud\noverlap region have fully developed and we observe first signs\nof a filamentation of the cloud 2 ahead of the front of cloud 1.\nThese filaments are initially oblique as Fig. 4(b) depicts. When\ncloud 1 has reached x \u2248 600, the upstream region ahead of cloud\n1 shows strong density oscillations of the ions of cloud 2 along\nthe x-axis, which are also depicted in Fig. 9(b). They cannot be\nrelated directly to the EES, because their wavelength along x\nis about \u03bbW /3. The patterns and their time-evolution eventually\nbecome complicated and presumably also high-dimensional.\nThe density distributions of the electrons of both clouds are\ncorrelated with those of the ions in the overlap region \u2212950 <\nx < 750, as the Fig. 10 is evidencing. An example is here the\ndensity pattern, which crosses y = 0 at |x| < 100 and is visible\nin all four species. The filaments in the interval \u2212500 < x < 500\nare, however, more diffuse than those of the ions in Fig. 9. The\ndensity peak of the electrons of cloud 1 at x \u2248 750 is comparable\nto that of the ions. Again, the electrons are confined to maintain\nthe quasi-neutrality of the plasma. The front end of the electrons\n\nof cloud 2 has been replaced by a gradual decrease of the electron density between \u22121500 < x < \u2212800. The electrons with\nx < \u2212950 are the fastest ones of cloud 2, which have outrun the\nbulk of the electrons moving with \u2212vb . The ripples in the electron density of cloud 2 at x > 750 are practically identical to\nthose of the ions in Fig. 9(b).\nMovie 2 reveals the time-evolution of the electron densities.\nDensity structures form rapidly close to the initial cloud contact\nboundary. These structures have no counterpart in the ion distributions in movie 1, until the cloud overlap layer covers |x| <\n\u223c 50.\nThis initial plasma evolution is thus determined by the electron\nfilamentation. The density of the electrons of cloud 1 is enhanced\nin the cloud overlap layer, while the electron density of cloud 2\nis decreased (See also Fig. 7(a)). Already at this early time, the\nfastest electrons of cloud 2 outrun the bulk of the electrons to\nform a low-density tail along x and one consequence is the reduction of the electron density of cloud 2 in the cloud overlap\nlayer. A strong correlation between the ions of both clouds and\nthe electrons of cloud 1 in the overlap layer is observed, when\nthe latter covers |x| <\n\u223c 100, demonstrating that these three species\nare involved in the formation of the large scale pattern. The electrons of cloud 2 show a distinct behaviour. This is also observed\nat a later time, when the overlap layer covers |x| <\n\u223c 200. The electrons of cloud 2 are redistributed at this time immediately after\nthey have crossed the front of cloud 1 at x \u2248 200, which is also\nshown by Fig. 6, and their density is not visibly correlated with\nthose of the other species.\nThis behaviour can be understood qualitatively. Consider a\ndense electron beam and a tenuous electron beam that undergo\nthe filamentation instability, which separates their currents. A\nhighly nonlinear filamentary electron distribution of the tenuous\nbeam can be compensated by a weak perturbation of the dense\nbeam. We thus expect that the spatial density modulations of the\ntenuous beam become nonlinear first. We also expect, that the\nhigh ion inertia results in a delay of their filamentation compared\nto that of the electrons and both species of cloud 2 will interact\ndifferently with the plasma of cloud 1.\nThe ions of cloud 2 in Movie 1 show structures similar to\nthose in cloud 1, which have initially no counterpart in the electrons of cloud 2 (Movie 2). The ions of cloud 2 reveal a higher\ndegree of non-uniformity than the electrons of cloud 1, when\nthe overlap layer spans the interval |x| <\n\u223c 200. We can attribute\nthis to their lower mean density. The increasingly pronounced\nlarge-scale modulation of the plasma density of cloud 1 at the\ntime T 1 imprints itself onto the electrons of cloud 2. The latter\nshow a modulation on two scales in Fig. 5. The density evolution of the electrons and of the ions eventually becomes similar,\nexcept close to the front of cloud 1. Far behind this front, the\nelectrons have thermalized. Since they have no free energy left\nwhich could lead to independent behaviour their density distribution follows that of the ions.\nWe explore now the density evolution of the electrons and\nions of cloud 2 ahead of the front of cloud 1 in the movies 1\nand 2. We determine now, if we find multiple particle beams\nupstream of cloud 1 that could give rise to beam-driven instabilities. The electrons of cloud 2 thermalize after they have crossed\nthe front of cloud 1 in Fig. 6 and we can no longer distinguish between the electrons of either cloud. Movie 2 shows no electrons\nof cloud 1 leaking upstream and the same should hold for the\nelectrons of cloud 2, which have been mixed with those of cloud\n1. This is supported by Fig. 7, which demonstrates firstly that no\nsignificant numbers of electrons from cloud 1 diffuse upstream\nand, secondly, that the electrons of cloud 2 ahead of cloud 1\nhave a uniform density and convect with the ions to preserve the\n\n\fM.

The upper row shows the magnetic field components B x (a), By (b) and\nBz (c). The lower row displays the E x (d), Ey (e) and Ez (f).\nquasi-neutrality of the upstream plasma. Figure 8 demonstrates\nthat no ions of cloud 1 leak upstream of its front and that no ions\nof cloud 2 are reflected at x = 300 to form a beam upstream of\ncloud 1. Movies 1 and 2 together with Fig. 2 evidence, however,\nthe growth of the EES and the onset of the filamentation upstream of cloud 1 prior to the time T 1 . These two processes thus\ngrow in an interval, in which we only find the plasma of cloud\n2 and no further particle beams. We may thus exclude for our\ncase study and until the time T 1 that particle beams (which can\nbe formed by leaking downstream plasma or reflected fast ion\nbeams in a quasi-parallel magnetic field geometry or in unmagnetized plasmas (Malkov 1998; Martins et al. 2009)), result in\nthe growth of the EES and in the observed upstream instability.\nFigure 11 displays the fields at the time T sim . The nonplanar\nB x reaches amplitudes comparable to B x,0/2. Both components\nof B\u22a5 evidence planar oscillations with an amplitude exceeding\nB x,0 and with a wavelength \u2248 120. The wavelength is unchanged\nand the EES is still circularly polarized. The amplitudes of By\nand Bz peak in the interval 600 < x < 1000 close to the front of\ncloud 1. Evanescent waves reach far upstream up to x \u2248 1700.\nThe E\u22a5 is more diffuse and Ey shows structuring along y. Quasiplanar structures close to and ahead of the front of cloud 1 are\nrevealed by E x for 700 < x < 1000. The wave vectors of these\noscillations point predominantly along x and their characteristic\nwavelength is short compared to that of the EES. They resemble\nthe structures of cloud 2 upstream of cloud 1 at late times in the\nmovies 1 and 2.\nThe evolution of the fields is presented in the movie 3 for\nthe three components of B and in the movie 4 for the three components of E. Until the time T 1 , when the overlap layer covers\n|x| < 300, the fields can be subdivided into those in this layer\nand those of the EES.\nWe discuss first the electromagnetic fields in the cloud overlap layer. The filamentation is observed best for B x and Ey .\nThe Bz is the dominant component of the filamentation instability in our 2D geometry and for a flow velocity vector along x\n(Bret et al. 2008; Schlickeiser & Shukla 2003). This component\nindeed shows a filamentation, but the adaptation of the colour\nscale to the EES reduces the contrast and it is not clearly visible. The B x , Ey and Bz show filamentary structures with a thickness below or equal to the ion skin depth. The filamentation of\nthese field components shows the same flow patterns as the ion\ndistribution in movie 1. The ion beam filamentation is thus the\nprimary driver of the fields. Oscillations of E x with a short wavelength along x are observed, which we have related previously\nto a Buneman-type instability.\nThe EES starts to grow immediately at the cloud collision\nboundary and it is thus a consequence of our initial conditions.\n\nThe initial jump of the convection electric field Ey across x = 0,\nits constant amplitude along y and the vanishing derivative along\nz imply that dEy /dx = \u2212\u2202t Bz. A seed field for magnetowaves develops at the initial contact boundary. We may interpret its consequence as follows. The magnetic field is approximately stationary in the dense plasma. This can be seen from the Ey in the\ncloud overlap layer in Movie 4, which is practically identical to\nthat in cloud 1 outside the layer. The deflection of the electrons\nof cloud 2 by this Bz, which is localized in x, will be stronger\nthan the deflection of the ions of cloud 2 and Jy , 0. The EES is\nunstable, which implies that the current amplifies the magnetic\nperturbation. The EES reaches a B\u22a5 \u2248 B x,0 already when the\ncloud overlap layer has expanded to cover |x| <\n\u223c 100. The EES is\nthus strong enough to cause the deflection of the ions at the tip\nof cloud 1 at the time T 1 in Fig. 8. The amplitudes of By and Bz\ngrow and the EES expands steadily until secondary instabilities\noccur.\nWhen the cloud overlap layer covers |x| <\n\u223c 500, the structures in B x upstream of cloud 1 in movie 3 start to accelerate\nalong y. This acceleration is most easily visible close to the position, where the amplitude of the EES peaks. The time, when\nthe structures of B x start to accelerate along y, coincides with\na similar flow of the structures of Ey and Ez in movie 4. Prior\nto their acceleration, the structures in B x resemble the oblique\nstructures in the plasma density of cloud 2 upstream of cloud 1\nfound at the time T 1 in the Figs. 4 and 5. The density structures\nand those of B x are modulated along x on scales comparable to\nthe wavelength of the EES.\nWe may interpret the formation and the acceleration of the\nfield structures in terms of an acceleration of the incoming particles of cloud 2 in the wave field of the EES. If its wave field is\nnot perfectly uniform along y, then the particle deflection is not\nequally efficient for all y, which will cause density modulations.\nThe particles of cloud 2 with their spatially nonuniform density are then accelerated in the y, z plane by the EES, resulting\nin nonuniform currents. A spatially nonuniform current could\ndrive the nonplanar field structures, which we observe in movies\n3 and 4. A nonuniform Jz would, for example, yield structures\nin B x, By and Ez by \u2202 x By \u2212 \u2202y B x = \u2202t Ez + Jz . The motion of B x\nand also of Ez and By would then be induced by that of the density structures. The growth and the accelerating motion along y\nof the structures are presumably tied to the increasing amplitude\nof the EES.\nMovie 4 shows that the E x oscillates outside the cloud overlap layer. The amplitude of E x is constant within each cloud on\nscales much larger that \u03bb s and the oscillations start instantly.\nThus, they cannot be connected to the processes at x \u2248 0, because of the finite light speed. These oscillations are periodic in\n\n\f10\n\nM. E.

Densities integrated over y at the time T sim . (a) shows\nthe electron densities and (b) the ion densities. The solid curve\ncorresponds to cloud 1 and the dashed curve to cloud 2. The\nlatter is multiplied by the factor 4.\n\ntime and their frequency is the electron plasma frequency of the\nrespective cloud. These oscillations presumably originate from\na slight initial mismatch of the currents of electrons and ions\nalong x in each cloud, which results through \u2202t E x = \u2212J x in electrostatic oscillations at the local plasma frequency.\nStructures in the plasma of cloud 2 with a wave vector that\nis aligned with x were observed in the Figs. 9 and 10 for 750 <\nx < 1200. Movies 3 and 4 provide additional information. These\nshort-scale structures do not show up in B\u22a5 and hence they do\nnot have a strong electromagnetic component. The modulations\nare most clearly visible from E x , for example in Fig. 11(d). A\npolarization along vb indicates that these waves are electrostatic.\nThe density structures in cloud 2 should thus be charge density\nwaves, similar to the Buneman waves we have observed in Fig.\n2(d). This charge density wave is not the only one upstream of\ncloud 1. Movie 3 shows at late times and for large x > 0, that\nmagnetowaves with a longer wavelength than that of the EES are\ngenerated that move faster than the EES.\nA wave conversion in form of a four-wave coupling of a\ncircularly polarized, large amplitude wave has been proposed\nby Goldstein (1978). The four interacting waves all have parallel wave vectors and they will thus all result in plasma and\nfield modulations along x in our geometry. The four-wave interaction results in a forward-propagating magnetowave with\nthe same polarization as the driving wave, which might be the\nlong-wavelength magnetowave observed in movie 3. It is faster\nthan the super-Alfv\u00e9nic EES, implying that it should propagate\nin the high-frequency branch of the left-hand polarized mode\n(Treumann & Baumjohann 1997). This parametric wave interaction also pumps a charge density wave, which could result in\nthe density modulation observed in the movies 1 and 2 ahead of\ncloud 1. Finally, the interaction should produce another magnetowave that moves in the opposite direction than the EES.\nWe could not identify this fourth wave in E(x, y, t0 ) and\nB(x, y, t0 ) at any given time t0 . This either means it is not there\nor that its amplitude is close to noise levels. Its wave vector is\naligned with that of the EES and it is a magnetowave (Goldstein\n1978). It should thus be detectable in slices of B\u22a5 (x) for y = 0,\nwhich we can plot as a function of time. The space-time corre-\n\nlation allows us to identify structures, which are not easily seen\nfrom individual time slices. Figure 12 shows them as a function\nof time. Both components of B\u22a5 show at x \u2248 800 and t \u2248 2700\nwaves propagating antiparallel to the EES. These fast waves\noriginate from processes taking place at the rear end of cloud\n2, which are fuelled by the different expansion speeds of electrons and ions into a vacuum. These waves can be seen already\nbefore they start to interact with the EES. The By amplitude is\nmodulated at x \u2248 1700 and t \u2248 1100. These waves are amplified\nas they pass through the EES. We have to emphasize though,\nthat the backward-propagating magnetowave is only barely visible in this plot and that we have not shown that its amplification\nby the EES results from a coherent 4-wave interaction. The latter would require more detailed correlation studies of the wave's\nphases. Our current simulation data is too noisy and we leave this\nto dedicated 1D PIC studies that can employ a higher number of\nparticles per cell to reduce noise levels.\nTwo lines are fitted in Fig. 12(a). The x = vb t is approximately twice the Alfv\u00e9n speed VA of the cloud 2. Initially, the\nrear end of the EES moves with vb and it is thus connected to the\nfront of cloud 1. The speed of the EES decreases steadily and\nits rear end at the time T sim coincides with the front of cloud 1\nat x \u2248 750 rather than vb T sim \u2248 950. This deceleration makes\nit difficult to determine the frequency of the EES, which should\nbe measured in its rest frame. The first maximum of By moves\nwith the front of cloud 1 and shows no change in time. We may\nconclude that its oscillation frequency is low or zero in this decelerating reference frame. The Bz shows a change at the front of\ncloud 1, which may evidence a frequency \u03c9EES , 0 of the EES.\nIt may, however also be related to the formation of the shock. We\ncan thus only conclude here that \u03c9EES <\n\u223c 2\u03c0/T sim \u2248 (me /mi )\u03c9ce .\nThe second fitted line in Fig. 12(a) corresponds to x = 0.8ct\nand it is an approximate boundary for the front of the EES. This\nexpansion speed is 0.87c in the reference of cloud 2.\nFigure 13 shows the densities of both clouds, averaged over\ny, at the time T sim . We consider only x > 0. The densities of all\nfour species are practically constant for x < 600 and the density\nof each species is comparable to its initial value. The processes\nin the cloud overlap layer have reached a state that does not in-\n\n\fM. E. Dieckmann et al.: 2D PIC simulation of an oblique shock\n\n11\n\nFig. 14.

The\ngrayscale is the 10-logarithmic density normalized to its peak.\n\nvolve a density modulation. No shock is present in this interval,\nbecause that would result in a plasma compression. The plasma\ndensity of cloud 1 rises in the interval 600 < x < 750 and decreases to zero for x > 800. The front of cloud 1 is thus still\nwell-defined. The density of cloud 1 increases to about 3-4 times\nits initial value in the interval 650 < x < 750, reaching a peak\ndensity of 6. The plasma density of cloud 2 reveals substantial\noscillations for x > 800 upstream of cloud 1. The electron and\nion density oscillations, which could be observed in the movies\n1 and 2, and the y-averaged densities do not match perfectly. The\nresulting net charge modulation results in charge density waves\nand the E x , 0 in Fig. 11(d).\nThe ion phase space density distribution in the x, p x plane\nand at the time T sim , which has been integrated over all other\nposition and momentum components, is shown in Fig. 14. The\nions of both clouds have started to mix in the x, p x -space, which\nis the condition for a shock formation. The ion clouds merge in\nthe interval 600 < x < 800, which coincides with the interval\nthat has an increased plasma density in the Fig. 13. The density increase is thus due to the shock compression and it will\nresult in a downstream region that expands along x. This future\ndownstream plasma has not yet thermalized, explaining why the\ndensity in Fig. 13 is not constant within 600 < x < 800.\nThe forward shock, which will be moving to higher x, will\nbe somewhat slower than the collision speed of c/2. It will move\nfaster than vb in the reference frame of cloud 2. This is because\nthe plasma has a net momentum in the simulation frame due to\nthe higher density of cloud 1. The shock moving in the direction\nof decreasing x will move slower than vb in the reference frame\nof cloud 1. We can already see the slowdown of the front of cloud\n1, which coincides with the amplitude maximum of the EES in\nFig. 12, which will form the forward moving shock.\nFigure 14 also reveals oscillations of the mean momentum\nhp x i(x) of cloud 2 in the interval 800 < x < 1000. The waves that\ncan cause such strong oscillations must yield clearly detectable\nfield oscillations in the same interval. They must be caused either\nby the charge density waves and the associated E x or by the EES\nahead of cloud 1, or by the combination of both. The wavelength\nof the oscillations is well below the wavelength \u2248 120 of the\nEES and comparable to that of the oscillations of E x in Fig. 11(d)\nwith a wavelength \u03bbW /3. The electrostatic potential of the charge\n\ndensity waves will indeed cause particle oscillations in the x, p x\nplane. The main effect of the EES, namely the gyro-bunching, is\nnot necessarily visible from the phase space density distribution\nin the x, p x plane. The B\u22a5 of the EES forces the ions on a gyroorbit orthogonal to x. The electrostatic component of the EES\nprovided by E x will, however, modulate the ion distribution in\nthe x, p x -plane. No clear modulation of the ion paths on scales\n\u223c \u03bbW is visible in Fig. 14 though.\nThe electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic speeds in\nthe interval in which we find the charge density waves and the\nforming shock. The peak Lorentz factor \u03b3 is 120, according to\nthe Fig. 15. This peak Lorentz factor is remarkable in that it\nexceeds even the (mi /me )(\u03b3[vc] \u2212 1) \u2248 60, which we would\nobtain if the energy of an electron would equal that of an ion\nmoving with the cloud collision speed vc = c/2. This energy\nis, however, reached only by a tenuous subpopulation of the\nelectrons in a limited spatial interval. This strong electron acceleration is presumably achieved by those fields, that give rise\nto what will become the shock-reflected ion beam. The ions of\ncloud 2 at x \u2248 750 in Fig. 14 are accelerated from the speed\n\u2212vb to the speed 0.5c > vb at this position and their velocity\nthus changes by more than vc . We also observe that the electrons are not only accelerated in the forming downstream region\n600 < x < 800, but they appear to be pre-accelerated in the interval 800 < x < 1100. The electron distribution shows narrow\nspikes in this region. The electron phase space density is smooth\nin the interval 500 < x < 750 and the energies are here comparable to the energy of an ion moving with vc . The peak energy\nof the electrons decreases steadily, as we go from x \u2248 500 to\nx \u2248 \u22121500. The characteristic distances crossed by electrons\nwith \u03b3 > 5 will not differ much during the short time T sim . This\ndistance is thus proportional to the time, which has passed since\nthey were accelerated. The energy to which electrons have been\naccelerated must therefore have increased with time.\nFigure 16 displays the electron phase space density from\nFig. 15, which has been integrated\nR \u221e over all x to give N(\u03b3). It also\nshows the probability \u00d1(\u03b3) = \u03b3 N(\u03b3\u2217 )d\u03b3\u2217 of finding electrons\nwith a Lorentz factor \u03b3\u2217 > \u03b3. Most electrons have a \u03b3 < 5. The\ndensity of this cool population is exaggerated, because we integrate over the full simulation box and, thus, over regions which\n\n\f12\n\nM. E.

The high energy tail in the interval 5 < \u03b3 < 100 in both distributions can\nbe approximated by an exponential and the densities decrease\nrapidly to zero for \u03b3 > 120.\nMovie 5 provides further insight into the electron acceleration mechanisms. It is a time-animation of the phase space density distributions fi (x, p x ) of the ions and fe (x, \u03b3) of the electrons\nuntil the time T sim . The colour scale denotes the 10-logarithmic\nnumber of computational particles in units of those of cloud 2.\nOne particle of cloud 1 corresponds to 10 of cloud 2.\nDuring the initial phase of the cloud collision, up to the time\nwhen the ions of both clouds overlap in the interval |x| <\n\u223c 50\nin movie 5, the ions propagate practically freely. The ion phase\nspace distribution at the front of each cloud is increasingly tilted,\nbecause ions with a higher speed propagate farther in a given\ntime interval. The electrons are moderately heated to \u03b3 \u2248 2.5 at\nthe front of cloud 2. The heating mechanisms are the filamentation instability and the Buneman-type instability, which also\nincrease the thermal spread of the ions of cloud 2 at its tip in\nFig. 8(b).\nWhen the cloud overlap layer covers |x| <\n\u223c 300, the electron\nheating at the front of cloud 2 has ceased and the electron acceleration sets in at the front of cloud 1. The slowdown of the ions\nof cloud 1 is visible and it increases steadily, which is consistent\nwith a magnetic deflection by the growing EES. When the ions\nof cloud 1 have reached x \u2248 400, the electrons are accelerated to\n\u03b3 \u2248 6. The movie 5 shows that this electron acceleration is limited to the interval covered by the EES. The electrons of cloud 2\nare accelerated as they approach the front of cloud 1. This acceleration results in a beam in fe (x, \u03b3) prior to their encounter with\nthe front of cloud 1 and a depletion of nonrelativistic electrons.\nThe movie 5 shows this as a detaching of the electron distribution from the coordinate axis \u03b3 = 1.\nWe may interpret this as follows. The electrons of cloud\n2 are dragged with the ions across the B\u22a5 of the EES and\nall electrons experience the same accelerating force during the\nsame time interval, resulting in a similar velocity increment for\nall electrons. The initial electron beam stays compact and the\nelectrons move on a corkscrew orbit in the circularly polarized\n\nFig. 17. Phase space distributions at the time 0.8T sim. (a) displays\nthe electrons and (b) the ions.\n\nEES (Dieckmann et al. 2008b). After this acceleration, the electrons of cloud 2 cross the front of cloud 1 and they are mixed\nin phase space to form a smooth density distribution. Movie 5\ndemonstrates that the electron acceleration by the EES increases\nsteadily in time, presumably because their cross-field transport\nacross the EES with its increasing amplitude and extent along x\nprovides a stronger acceleration for a longer time.\nWhen the ions of cloud 1 have propagated to x \u2248 500 in\nmovie 5, the ions of both clouds start to merge. We show the\nphase space densities fi (x, p x ) and fe (x, \u03b3) of both species directly after this merger at the time 0.8T sim \u2248 2800 in Fig. 17. We\nnotice at this time localized and strong oscillations of hp x i(x) at\n800 < x < 1000 and weaker ones with a shorter wavelength\nwithin the interval 400 < x < 800. The electrons are accelerated\nto highly relativistic energies by these structures, as expected.\nConsider a force that causes velocity oscillations of the ions of\n\u2206V \u2248 0.1c in Fig. 17(b). The same force will clearly result in\nrelativistic electron velocity oscillations. The oscillations of the\nion mean momentum move in the negative x-direction in movie\n5 and they are amplified as they pass through the EES.\nWe may associate these wave structures with the backward\npropagating charge density waves and magnetowaves expected\nfrom the four-wave interaction, although we have to point out\nthat the strong plasma modulations imply a nonlinear stage of\nthe plasma, which is not incorporated into the equations describing the four-wave interaction. A consequence can be that e.g. the\nstrong and compact magnetowave modulates the plasma density\nby the ponderomotive force of its fields. The fields resulting in\nthe large modulation must belong to a well-defined wave packet.\nFigure 12 evidences at the time 0.8T sim the presence of a magnetowave in the interval 800 < x < 1000, in which we find the\nstrong momentum oscillation of cloud 2 in Fig. 17(b). The oscillations of hp x i(x) in the interval 600 < x < 700 may correspond\nto the charge density wave, which we observed at late times in\nthe movies 1 and 2. Both, the charge density waves and the magnetowave accelerate electrons to highly relativistic speeds.\nWe finally assess the energy contained by the fields at the\ntime T sim and the value of plasma collisions of the type we have\nconsidered here for the magnetic field amplification upstream\nof the main blast shell of a SNR. The magnetic energy density in physical units B2 /2\u03bc0 is normalized to B20 /2\u03bc0 and the\nelectric energy density in physical units \u01eb0 E2 /2 is normalized to\n\n\fM. E.

Field energy densities at the time T sim . (a) considers the\nmagnetic energy density and (b) that of the electric field.\n\n13\n\nThe densities of the clouds differ by a factor of 10\nand the collision is asymmetric, as in the simulation by\nBessho & Ohsawa (1999); Zindo et al. (2005); Sorasio et al.\n(2006). Initially the magnetic field is uniform and quasi-parallel\nto the flow velocity vector. Its significant strength together with\nthe high plasma temperature of 25 keV and the unequal cloud\ndensities reduce the growth rate of the filamentary instabilities\n(Bret et al. 2006, 2007).\nDieckmann et al. (2008b) have previously probed the higher\n\u03b3 regime appropriate for the internal shocks of gamma-ray\nbursts. Here we consider the mildly relativistic regime, with a\ncollision speed 0.5c between both clouds. Such a speed might be\nrealistic for a plasma subshell outrunning the main SNR shock.\nSuch subshells can reach relativistic flow speeds for particularly\nviolent SNR explosions (Kulkarni et al. 1998). In our initial conditions, the magnetic energy surpasses the thermal energy of the\ndense plasma slab by a factor of 5. The plasma flow implies,\nhowever, that the box-averaged plasma kinetic energy density\nexceeds the magnetic energy density by an order of magnitude.\nWe summarize several aspects of our results.\n4.1. Effects due to initial conditions\n\nc2 B20 /2\u03bc0 . Both are plotted in Fig. 18. Significant field energy\ndensities are found only close to the front of cloud 1 at x \u2248 750.\nThe magnetic field dominates and its peak energy density exceeds that of the electric field by the factor \u2248 25. The slowdown\nof the front of cloud 1 implies that the E\u22a5 = \u2212v f \u00d7 B\u22a5 decreases,\nwhere v f is the speed of the front of cloud 1 that was initially vb .\nThe energy density of the magnetic field is amplified by over an\norder of magnitude by the plasma collision and by the shock formation. The strongest magnetic fields corresponding to the circularly polarized EES coincide with the fastest electrons in the\nsimulation. This interval should emit significant electromagnetic\nradiation.\n\n4. Discussion\nWe have described in this paper the collision of two plasma\nclouds at the speed c/2. The ion to electron mass ratio of 400\nhas allowed us to model the collision in two spatial dimensions\nuntil the shock forms. Then we had to stop the simulation. The\nacceleration of electrons to speeds \u223c c and the rapid expansion\nspeed of the energetic electromagnetic structure (EES) imply,\nthat both will quickly reach the boundaries; hence our periodic\nboundary conditions become invalid. Open boundaries would allow the electrons and the wave energy to flow out of the system.\nHowever, the instabilities driven by these beams (Martins et al.\n2009) and by the EES are important for the upstream dynamics\nand the latter will be adversely affected by open boundaries.\nThe filamentary structures can form and merge in the 2D\ngeometry we consider here up to the instant when the magnetic repulsion of two filaments with oppositely directed current enforces their spatial separation (Davidson et al. 1972;\nLee & Lampe 1973), at least in the absence of an oblique magnetic field. Then no further mergers occur since only one dimension is available orthogonal to the flow velocity vector. A\nrealistic 3D PIC simulation would allow the filaments to move\naround each other and merge with other filaments of equal polarity (Lee & Lampe 1973). A 3D PIC simulation is, however,\ncurrently impossible for our case study involving ions, because\nof the computational cost involved in resolving ion and electron\nscales. Simulations in three spatial dimensions are now feasible\nfor the case of leptonic shocks (Nishikawa et al. 2009).\n\nOur initial conditions have resulted in the formation of planar\nwave and plasma structures, the most important one being the\nEES. We think that the EES grew out of a localized seed magnetic field pulse driven by the spatial gradient of the convection\nelectric field. The plasma upstream of the dense cloud is destabilized by this electromagnetic structure and the EES expands at\nthe speed 0.87c in the reference frame of the tenuous cloud. The\nenergy for its growth and expansion is provided by the kinetic\nenergy of the upstream medium, which moves with respect to\nthe EES. The shock speed <\n\u223c vc then implies that we have a coherent magnetic layer that expands its width at a speed of at least\n(0.87c \u2212 vc )/(1 \u2212 0.87vc/c) \u2248 0.65c, measured in the reference\nframe of the tenuous cloud. It covered about 80 ion skin depths\nat the end of the simulation, showing no signs of a slowdown.\nThe EES is a consequence of our initial conditions and\nthe growth of the seed magnetic field amplitude could probably be reduced but not suppressed by a smoother change of\nthe convection electric field, which can be achieved by a gradual change of the plasma convection speed (Bessho & Ohsawa\n1999; Zindo et al. 2005). However, the seed magnetic field\ncould be provided also by waves with a short wavelength, e.g.\nwhistlers, and it is thus not unphysical.\nStructures with strong magnetic fields, similar to the EES\nand known as SLAMS, are frequently observed close to quasiparallel shocks in the solar system plasma and they can accelerate electrons to high energies. They are thus potentially important also for SNR shock physics. Our initial conditions provide\na possibility to let nonlinear MHD waves grow out of a simple\nsimulation setup for a further study. The EES is moving with the\nions of the dense cloud and it modulates the ions and electrons of\nthe tenuous cloud, thereby gaining energy. Its growth probably\nrequires an asymmetric plasma collision.\n4.2. Shock formation\n\nIn this paper we modelled the formation of the shock from the\ninitial collision of two plasma clouds. The signatures of the\nshock are evident, including visible thermal broadening behind\nthe shock and a dense shock ramp. While filamentation structures form ahead of and behind the shock, we note that the\n\n\f14\n\nM. E. Dieckmann et al.: 2D PIC simulation of an oblique shock\n\nstructure is basically planar in the critical foreshock area, where\nelectron acceleration is expected to occur. This means that onedimensional simulations will be relevant in this region, allowing\nmuch higher resolution, increased particle number (resulting in\nlower particle noise and a better phase space resolution) and a\nhigher ion-electron mass ratio, than is currently found in two\nand three-dimensional simulations.\nIt is evident from the simulation that the filamentation is\nnot fully suppressed by the guiding magnetic field and by the\nhigh plasma temperature. Its amplitude has been set such that it\nshould suppress the electron filamentation if the plasma would\nbe spatially uniform (Bret et al. 2006). This amplitude is apparently insufficient to suppress the slower filamentation of the ion\nbeams and we could even see evidence for an electron beam filamentation just behind the front. The front of the dense plasma\ncloud maintains its planarity throughout the simulation, but even\nhere the density was non-uniform along the boundary. The onset\nof the filamentation was, however, delayed. The likely cause is\nthe high density gradient across the front, which alters the electron and ion skin depths and thus the characteristic scale of the\nfilaments. The gradient is caused by the slowdown of the ions\nby the magnetic field of the EES and by the electron acceleration. The electrons are confined at the front in the direction of\nthe shock normal so that they preserve the quasi-neutrality of the\nplasma, but they can move orthogonally to it. The latter results\nin a drift current.\n4.3. Field amplification\n\nVolk et al. (2005) and Ellison & Vladimirov (2008) have described observations of magnetic field amplification above the\nvalue expected from shock compression in SNRs. At the final\nsimulation time the magnetic field energy density is increased in\nstrength by over one order of magnitude, exceeding by far that\nexpected from the magnetic field compression by the shock. A\nshock compresses only the magnetic field component perpendicular to the shock normal, which is weak in our case, and the\namplification of its energy density can reach a factor of 4-7. The\nmagnetic energy density at the simulation's end has been comparable to the box-averaged kinetic energy density in an interval\nspanning about 10-20 ion skin depths. The magnetic energy density due to the EES was at least twice as high as that of the background field in an interval covering 50 ion skin depths. Even if\nwe take into account that the kinetic energy density close to the\nshock is increased by the accumulation of plasma, the magnetic\nenergy density still constitutes a sizeable fraction of the local\ntotal plasma kinetic energy density. The EES has provided the\nmain contribution to the magnetic energy density and exceeded\nthat due to the filaments downstream by two orders of magnitude.\nThroughout this paper, we used normalized quantities in our\nsimulation and we can scale the magnetic field amplitude to the\nrelevant plasma conditions. If we set the electron density of the\ndense cloud to 1 cm\u22123 , we would obtain a peak magnetic field\nwith a strength of 10 mG. However, we have to point out that\nour initial magnetic field amplitude has been higher than that expected for the ambient plasma, even if we take into account its\namplification by cosmic ray-driven instabilities, and our simulation results may not be directly applicable.\nWhere does the extra field come from? Amplification of the\nmagnetic field can occur from the electron drift current arising\nfrom the E \u00d7 B drift motion in a layer close to the shock that is\nnarrower than the ion gyroradius but wider than the electron gyroradius, see, e.g. Baumjohann & Treumann (1996). The current\n\nadds to the shock current and increases the jump in the perpendicular magnetic field. This can only occur when the ion and\nelectron gyroradii differ, i.e. not in a pair plasma. The EES has\na significant E x -component and |B\u22a5 | \u2248 |B0 |. We thus obtain a\nE \u00d7 B drift orthogonal to the flow velocity vector.\nWe have also found that the requirement to maintain quasineutrality of the plasma implies that the upstream electrons are\ndragged with the upstream ions across the EES, which moves\nwith the shock. The resulting v \u00d7 B drift accelerates the electrons orthogonally to the shock propagation direction, further\nenhancing the net current and the magnetic field. Finally, magnetic fields of SLAMS are provided by the current due to the\ngyro-bunched ions, which rotate in the plane orthogonal to the\nwavevector.\nThese mechanisms increase the mean magnetic field, and are\ndifferent from the instability described by Bell (2004) who has\ndescribed a cosmic ray streaming instability which can amplify\nturbulent magnetic fields ahead of the shock. We can exclude\nBell's instability here since we have not found energetic particles with a significant density moving upstream, which would\nprovide the net current that drives this instability.\n4.4. Electron acceleration and upstream wave spectrum\n\nThe shock retains its planar structure after it forms. A circularly\npolarised large-scale precursor wave, the EES, expands into the\nforeshock. Its wavelength is several times the ion skin depth. It\ngradually rotates the quasi-parallel magnetic field into a quasiperpendicular one at the current layer and it forces the incoming ions and electrons to interact with it nonlinearly. The ions\nare gyro-bunched and some of the incoming ions of the tenuous\ncloud are reflected by the forming shock. We have found evidence of a parametric instability (Goldstein 1978) of the EES\nahead of the foreshock and we could find at least two waves that\nmay be the result of this parametric decay. These waves appear\nat late times, when the EES has expanded in space and is thus\nsufficiently monochromatic. They grow to an amplitude that introduces oscillations of the mean velocity of the ions of up to\nc/5.\nThe interplay of the short-scale charge density waves and\nmagnetowaves causes the electrons to be accelerated to highly\nrelativistic speeds upstream of the forming shock. Similar electron acceleration (injection) mechanisms upstream of shocks involving whistler waves have been proposed by Levinson (1992);\nKuramitsu & Krasnoselskikh (2005a,b). The strongest electron\nacceleration is, however, observed at the location where the\nshock-reflected ion beam is developing. The electrons are accelerated to a peak Lorentz factor of 120 and their energy gain\nis thus comparable to the energy associated with the velocity\nchange of the shock-reflected ions. If the electron acceleration\nis accomplished by the electromagnetic fields that reflect the incoming upstream ions, then the energy gain of the electrons may\nscale with the ion mass. We may expect in this case that the electrons are accelerated to a Lorentz factor \u03b3 M \u2248 120m p /mi that is\n\u03b3 M \u2248 550 if we would use the correct proton to electron mass\nratio.\nIt is interesting to see if this type of electron acceleration\ncan also occur close to Solar system shocks. Let us consider\nthe Earth bow shock as one of the best known collisionless\nshocks and let us assume a Solar wind speed of 4 \u00d7 105 m/s\nto 7.5 \u00d7 105 m/s. A specular reflection of the incoming Solar\nwind protons by the bow shock would change their energy by\nabout 0.8 keV to 3 keV. Electrons with such energies are observed in a thin sheet close to the shock surface of perpendicular\n\n\fM. E. Dieckmann et al.: 2D PIC simulation of an oblique shock\n\nshocks (Anderson et al. 1979). Perpendicular shocks are capable\nto produce shock-reflected ion beams (Lembege et al. 2004) and\nthe electron acceleration mechanism we observe here may work\nalso at the Earth bow shock.\n4.5. Future work\n\nThis simulation study was concerned with the collision of two\nplasma clouds at a mildly relativistic speed. Its purpose has been\nto better understand the conditions and the mechanisms involved\nin the formation of a shock. This shock will move at an essentially nonrelativistic speed below the initial collision speed and,\nthus, be relevant for fast SNR flows. A two-dimensional simulation geometry was necessary to assess the importance of the\nmulti-dimensional filamentation instability for the shock dynamics. A quasi-parallel guiding magnetic field was used to slow\ndown this filamentation, resulting in a planar (one-dimensional)\nshock.\nThe formation of the shock could be observed, but the simulation had to be stopped at this time due to computational constraints. This simulation has, however, revealed several aspects\nthat should be examined in more detail in more specialised simulation studies.\nThe EES probably formed in response to our initial conditions. i.e. the sharp jump in the convection electric field at\nthe cloud collision boundary. It has to be investigated if the\nEES also forms if this jump is decreased, for example by a\nhigher-order field interpolation scheme or by a gradual decrease of the convection electric field by a smooth change in the\nplasma convection speed. The simulations by Bessho & Ohsawa\n(1999); Zindo et al. (2005) suggest that this will leave unchanged the magnetic field amplification and the electron acceleration. However, the EES may not be so strong and coherent.\nThe magnetic field amplitude in the present study is higher\nthan it is realistic for a SNR scenario. Future studies must address how the shock formation depends on lower amplitudes of\nthe guiding magnetic field. Computationally inexpensive parametric simulation studies that resolve only one spatial dimension\nmay provide insight. Initial studies not discussed here indicate\nthat the shock formation is delayed by a decreasing magnetic\nfield amplitude.\nIt is also necessary to follow the plasma collision for a longer\ntime. An important aspect is here how far the EES can expand\nupstream and how strong the downstream magnetic field is. The\nplanarity of the EES and of the shock boundary may permit us\nto use one-dimensional simulations, by which we can expand by\nat least an order of magnitude the box size along the collision\ndirection.\nAn one-dimensional simulation also allows us to examine\nwith a larger number of particles per cell and, thus, lower noise\nlevels the secondary instabilities driven by the EES. We have\nfound evidence for an instability of the EES to a four-wave interaction. Lower noise levels would allow us to compare the amplitudes and phases of the EES with those of the secondary waves,\nwhich is necessary to demonstrate a coherent wave interaction.\nExtending the simulation time together with suitable initial conditions would, potentially, allow us to investigate what happens\nif the speed of the EES decreases below the local Alfv\u00e9n speed.\nIt is possible that the EES decouples from the shock and propagates independently in form of an Alfv\u00e9n wave packet.\nFinally, it would be interesting to reduce the collision speed\nto about c/10, which is close to the expansion speed of the SNR\nshock, to see if and how many electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds. This will provide insight into the electron in-\n\n15\n\njection efficiency of oblique shocks and, thus, into the ability of\nSNR shocks to accelerate electrons to cosmic ray energies.\nAcknowledgements.
