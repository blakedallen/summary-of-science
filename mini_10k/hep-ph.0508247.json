It is\nshown that experimental mass-resolutions as low as 8.7 MeV/c2 are attainable.\n\nWork presented at the International Conference on Linear Colliders (LCWS04),\n19-23 April 2004, Le Carre des Sciences, Paris, France.\n\nI have studied the cascade process e+ e\u2212 \u2192\u03c7\u030302 \u03c7\u030302 \u2192 l\u0303l\u0303ll \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 lll\u2032l\u2032 at a\nnumber of SPS points[1,2]. Simulated events were processed by the fast detector simulation SGV[3-5]. Events that did not contain other charged particles\nthan the four leptons, and had clear signs of undetected particles were further\nanalysed. The \u03c7\u03030 :s were reconstructed using the seen leptons and conservation\nlaws. E and |p| of the \u03c7\u030302 :s follow from energy conservation and their direction\nis found the way pW in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd is found, yielding two possible\nsolutions[6]. The momentum of the \u03c7\u030301 was obtained from Pll and each of the\ntwo \u03c7\u030302 solutions, and Pl\u0303 by adding the momentum of \u03c7\u030301 to the appropriate\nPl . As there is no way to determine which lepton came from the slepton decay,\nand there are two possible values for the momentum of \u03c7\u030301 , there will be four\npossible solutions for each slepton (or eight in 4e or 4\u03bc events). a\nSlepton mass determination in SPS1a. In SPS1a, at Ecms = 500 GeV,\nand L =500 fb\u22121 , 800 events of this type are expected. There are no other\ncascades open, but one expects 106 other SUSY events. Events were selected\nas above: There should nothing but four charged leptons seen, p/t > 10GeV/c,\nMvis \u2208[100, 300] GeV/c2 , Eseen (Eseen,neut ) < 300 (150) GeV. The thrustaxis should be above 0.3 Rad, and Ecalo,below30\u25e6 < 150 GeV (the last two cuts\nremoves the \u03b3\u03b3 background). For all eight (or 16) possible values of Pl\u0303 the\ninvariant mass was calculated. A narrow peak at the right mass corresponds to\nthe correct solutions (two per event). The decay of the \u03c7\u030302 is a three-body decay\n(ll \u03c7\u030301 ), so the tail from the wrong solutions can be suppressed by demanding\nthat they should be in the Dalitz-triangle, and be within the narrow bands\ncorresponding to the right combination (fig 1a). One can often reject the\na Similar\n\nideas have been applied by other workers for background rejection in SUSY searches\nat LEP[7], to cascades at LHC[8] and to \u1ebd-production in e+ e+ -collisions[9].\n\n1\n\n\f3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n\n60\n\n2\n\na)\n\nFWHM(Mslepton) [GeV/c ]\n\n2\n\n\u2206Mslept, sol. 2 [GeV/c ]\n\n2 2\n\n-4\n\nM (\u03a7l2) [(GeV/c ) 10 ]\n\n4\n\nb)\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n2\n\n-20\n\n2\n\n-40\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n2 2\n\n4\n\n-60\n\nM2(\u03a7l1) [(GeV/c ) 10-4]\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nd)\n\n140\n\n175\n\n2\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206(M(\u03a72)) [GeV/c2]\n\nf)\n\n20\n\n15\n12.5\n10\n\n75\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n25\n\n20\n\n0\n100\n\n3\n\n17.5\n\n80\n\n100\n\n4\n\n22.5\n\ne)\n\n100\n\n125\n\n5\n\n\u2206Mslept, sol. 1 [GeV/c2]\n\n120\n\n150\n\nc)\n\n6\n\n0\n\n60\n\n160\n200\n\n7\n\n1\n\n-60\n1\n\n8\n\n7.5\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n2\n\nMslepton [GeV/c ]\n\n0\n\n5\n2.5\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n2\n\nMslepton [GeV/c ]\n\n0\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n2\n\nMstau [GeV/c ]\n\nFigure 1: Various kinematic distributions, for \u03bc\u0303 in SPS1a, if nothing else is mentioned. a)\nDalitz plot. b) Difference between the two reconstructed M\u03bc\u0303 for each of the solutions. c)\nFWHM of the peak as a function of M\u03c7\u03030 true \u2212 M\u03c7\u03030 input . d) M\u03bc\u0303 . e) M\u03bc\u0303 in SPS3. f) M\u03c4\u0303 .\n2\n\n2\n\nwrong \u03c7\u030302 -solution by demanding that the masses are equal: in the vertical\nband in fig 1b, solution 1 is likely to be correct, in the horizontal, solution\n2. In fig 1c, the width of the peak is shown as a function of M\u03c7\u030302 : the clear\nminimum shows that M\u03c7\u030302 can also be extracted from the data. Fig 1d shows\nthe observed distribution of the reconstructed Ml\u0303 with background, ISR and\nbeam-strahlung included (the two latter do not effect \u03c3, but migrates events\nto the tails, reducing \u01eb). The background, dominated by \u1ebdR \u1ebdL \u2192 e\u03c7\u030301 e\u03c7\u030302 \u2192\ne\u03c7\u030301 el\u0303l \u2192 e\u03c7\u030301 ell\u2032 \u03c7\u030301 , is flat. The width of the reconstructed mass peak is 83\nMeV/c2 (experimental resolution: the generated natural width is 0). There\nare 90 events in the peak (\u01eb= 11 %). The error on the mass (= \u221a\u03c3N ) is 8.7\nMeV/c2 (0.05 ). The fitted mass (true mass) is 174.74 (174.73) GeV/c2 .\n\n\u0087\n\nMultiple cascades. In SPS3, both \u1ebdR and \u1ebdL have masses below M\u03c7\u030302 ,\nyielding cascades that cannot be separated by the identity of the leptons. Still,\nwith minor modifications, the same method can be used to extract both Ml\u0303 .\nThe Dalitz-triangle does not depend on Ml\u0303 , but the presence of several particles\nwill show up as more bands. To analyse the events, the position of one peak is\ndetermined, then events with masses close to this value in one Dalitz-projection\n2\n\n\fare cut out, which enables to find the smaller peak in the other projection (fig\n1e). There is little SUSY background in SPS3, since both \u1ebdR and \u1ebdR have\nmasses below M\u03c7\u030302 : The \u1ebdR \u1ebdL channel cannot be confused with the signal. The\nfit to the two peaks yields \u03c3L(R) = 103(176)MeV/c2 . At Ecms = 800 GeV and\nwith L =500 pb\u22121 , 50(18) events are found in the peak, yielding \u03b4(M\u03bc\u0303 ) =14.5\n(41.4) MeV/c2 (0.05 (0.2) ). The fitted mass is 290.0(181.9) GeV/c2 , while\nthe true value is 289.96 (181.83) GeV/c2 .\nStau channels. Because of the \u03bd:s in the \u03c4 -decays, the method will\nnot work for \u03c4\u0303 :s. However, in channels where only one \u03c7\u030302 decays to a \u03c4\u0303 ,\nan approximation can be found, if M\u03bc\u0303 (or M\u1ebd ) is known: using the known\nmasses (including M\u03c4 ), the the events can be reconstructed, except for two\nunknowns. One - the azimuthal angle between the \u03c4 and the \u03c4 -jet - has a\nminor effect on the reconstructed M\u03c4\u0303 . The other is E\u03c4 in the \u03c7\u030302 decay, which\ncan be estimated using all available information, and an initial guess on M\u03c4\u0303 .\nAt certain combinations of Ejet and Mjet , E\u03c4 can only vary within a quite\nlimited range, and - under very general assumptions - the p.d.f. of E\u03c4 can be\ndetermined. Therefore, for any Ejet and Mjet , E(E\u03c4 ) and V(E\u03c4 ) can be found,\nand one can select events with low variance estimates . The cuts used are the\nsame as for \u1ebd and \u03bc\u0303 except that the topology should be two leptons and two\n\u03c4 -jets[10], and that the \u1ebdR \u1ebdL background must be removed by selecting events\nwithout electrons. In fig 1f, the final mass plot for SPS1a is shown. One finds\n\u03c3= 5.07 GeV/c2 , and 176 events in the peak (\u01eb= 7 %). This leads to \u03b4(M\u03c4\u0303 ) =\n), comparable to other methods[11]. The fitted mass (true\n380 MeV/c2 (3\nmass) is 135.3 (135.4) GeV/c2 . M\u03c4\u0303 is one input to the E\u03c4 estimation; it was\nverified that the fitted value was not sensitive to the input. By varying the \u03c4\u0303\nmixing, it was also verified that the peak indeed moves with M\u03c4\u0303 .\nConclusions. By reconstructing \u03c7\u030302 cascades when the cascade passes a\nl\u0303, I show that \u03b4(Ml\u0303 ) as low as 8.7 MeV/c2 (\u03bc\u0303 in SPS1a) can be obtained, with\nISR, beam-strahlung, detector-resolution, background and ambiguities taken\ninto account. An approximate method to treat \u03c4\u0303 -channels was presented.\n\n\u0087\n\n\u0087\n\n1. M. Berggren, Reconstructing sparticles in cascade decays at the FLC,\nLC-note (in preparation).\n2. B.C.
