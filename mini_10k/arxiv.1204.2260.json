Introduction\nDeveloping physical, chemical and biological analogies of socio-economic processes are\nbecoming increasingly popular nowadays because they give rise to new metaphors and\nuncover unique similarities. Successful examples of such cross-disciplinary fertilisation\ninclude the theory of fractal cities [7], leaf-inspired simulation of street network\ngrowth [23,6], urban theories by Alexander [5] and Salingaros [24], approaches relating\nurban morphology to biological morphogenesis [18], and indeed the whole branch of sociophysics [11].\nDespite the overwhelming success of the bio-inspired simulation and socio-physics, the\nprevailing majority of publications deal with purely theoretical works and computer\nsimulations. Almost no attempts have been made to undertake experimental laboratory\ncomparisons between very large-scale socio-economic developments and spatio-temporal\n\n\fdynamics of chemical or biological systems. This could be explained by difficulties in finding\na suitable experimental substrate which does not require sophisticated laboratory equipment\nand expensive support. A breakthrough came in 2009 when first experimental results on\nimitating roads networks in United Kingdom with plasmodium of slime mould Physarum\npolycephalum were published [4] followed by imitation of rail networks in Japan [30].\nPlasmodium is a vegetative stage of acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. This is a\nsingle cell with many nuclei. The plasmodium fees on microscopic particles [28]. During its\nforaging behaviour the plasmodium spans scattered sources of nutrients with a network of\nprotoplasmic tubes. The protoplasmic network is optimised to cover all sources of food and\nto provide a robust and speedy transportation of nutrients and metabolites in the plasmodium\nbody. The plasmodium's foraging behaviour can be interpreted as computation. Data are\nrepresented by spatial configurations of attractants and repellents, and results of computation\nby structures of protoplasmic network formed by the plasmodium on the data sites [19,21,3].\nThe problems solved by plasmodium of P. polycephalum include shortest path [19,21],\nimplementation of storage modification machines [3], Voronoi diagram [26], Delaunay\ntriangulation [3], logical computing [33,2], and process algebra [25]; see overview in [3].\nIn the pioneering experimental works [4,30] configuration of major cities and boundaries of\nthe countries were physically imitated by distribution of oat flakes (which attract the slime\nmould) and shape of agar plate (growth substrate). Reasonably good matches between\nprotoplasmic tubes developed by P. polycephalum and man-made road networks were\ndetected and experimentally verified. The findings paved a new way towards study of human\ntransportation systems but more work is required to develop deeper conclusions, especially\nrelated to urbanization phenomena. Also, a great deal of this research was performed by\ncomputer scientists and biologists, who might lack substantial information about cities and\nthe development of urban settlements, which may affect the interpretations of experimental\nlaboratory results in terms of real-world transport networks. In the present paper we aim to\nbridge this gap and try to evaluate to what extent the emergent behaviour of P. polycephalum\nreflects structure and dynamics of human transportation systems at the macro-scale.\nWe focus on the well studied and historically understood Vie Consolari street system (VC) in\nthe Italian peninsula. VC system is one of the first modern human transportation systems\nlinking cities and certainly the first in Europe. VC is also a modern regional transportation\nnetwork at the first stage of its development and it is also possible to trace back its evolution\nto observe that Rome linked all the important primordial principal cities in the Italian\nPeninsula. This fact is important given that VC is a transportation network that is not affected\nby the complex amount of changes derived by technological evolutions in transportation\nsystems and - more generally - by the stratification of historical facts like wars,\ndemography dynamics and natural hazards. It is derived by a top-down and self organized\nlocal organization given the complete absence of bottom-up technologies in regional\nplanning.\nExperimental simulations confirm that P. polycephalum matches the street network in a\ncertain degree but we find also that there is an interesting similarities between the\ncolonization processes in which principal streets have been built, this can suggest very\nrelevant questions regarding self organization in the urbanization processes. It is now known\nthat VC are now mostly overlapped by modern motorways [9] and there is a body of study\ndedicated in tracking the original street system in all of the Roman Empire [27]. For this\nstudy we are choosing the reconstruction proposed by [35] choosing the street systems it\nsupposed to link the major cities in Italy at the Imperial Age (I Sec a.C.)\nVie Consolari is amongst few, if any other, ancient road networks which survived and are\nstill in use in modern times. The Vie Consolari was the regional transportation network\nbetween major cities in Italian peninsula at the time of Roman Empire, and evolution of\n\n\fItalian transport system can be traced back and hopefully replayed using configuration of\n\"primordial\" cities in the Italian peninsula.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe experimental techniques used. We\nanalyse transport systems generated by slime mould in Sect. 3. We consider protoplasmic and\nman-made networks in a context of planar proximity graphs in Sect. 4. The development of\napproximations of Vie Consolari transport networks with a particle model of P.\npolycephalum is presented in Sect. 4. We summarise the findings of the paper in Sect. 5 and\nsuggest further research which may reconcile the top-down requirements of efficient\ntransport links with the bottom-up development of urbanization processes.\n\n2. Experimental\nWe selected 11 cities\nfor laboratory experiments (see configuration of the areas in Fig. 1):\n2\n1.\nGenua/Genova\n2.\nPlacentia/Piacenza\n3.\nAquileia/Venezia\n4.\nBononia/Bologna\n5.\nFlorenzia/Firenza\n6.\nAriminum/Rimini\n7.\nRoma/Roma\n8.\nCapua/Capua\n9.\nVenusia/Venusia\n10.\nBrundisium/Brindisi\n11.\nRheghium Reggio/Calabria\n\nPlasmodium of P. polycephalum is cultivated in plastic container, on paper kitchen towels\nmoistened with still water, and fed with oat flakes. For experiments we use 120 mm\npolystyrene square Petri dishes and 2% agar gel (Select agar, by Sigma Aldrich) as a\nsubstrate. Agar plates, about 2-3 mm in depth, are cut in a shape of Italy. To represent\nApennine Mountains impassable for vehicular traffic we removed corresponding parts of agar\nplate.\nThe major cities\nare imitated by oat flakes placed in the positions of agar plate\ncorresponding to the areas. At the beginning of each experiment an oat flake colonised by\nplasmodium is placed in Rome area. We undertook 28 experiments. The Petri dishes with\nplasmodium are kept in the dark, at temperature 22-25\u00b0 C, except for observation and image\nrecording. Periodically, we took photographs of the experimental Petri dishes with Canon\nD50 digital camera.\nThe graph\nof Roman road network (Fig. 1b) is constructed as follows. Let\nbe a set of\nurban regions/cities; for any two regions\nand\nfrom\n, the nodes\nand\nare\nconnected by an edge\nif there is a road starting in vicinity of , passing in vicinity of ,\nand not passing in vicinity of any other urban area\n. In the case of branching \u2013 that is, a\nroad starts in , goes in the direction of and , and at some point branches towards and\n\u2013 we then add two separate edges\nand\nto the graph . The road graph is planar\n(Fig. 1b).\nTo generalise our experimental results we constructed a Physarum graph with weighted-\n\n\fedges. A Physarum graph is a tuple\n, where\nis a set of urban areas,\nis a\nset edges, and\nassociates each edge of\nwith a probability (or weights). For\nevery two regions and from\nthere is an edge connecting and if a plasmodium's\nexperiments, and the edge\nhas a\nprotoplasmic link is recorded at least in one of\nprobability calculated as a ratio of experiments where protoplasmic link\noccurred in the\ntotal number of experiments\n. For example, if we observed a protoplasmic tube\nconnecting areas and\nin 12 experiments, the weight of edge\nwill be\n.\nWe do not take into account the exact configuration of the protoplasmic tubes but merely\ntheir existence. Further we will be dealing with threshold Physarum graphs\n. The threshold Physarum graph is obtained from Physarum graph\nby the transformation:\n. That is all edges with weights less than\nare removed.\n\n(a)\n\n(b) [\n\n]\n\n\f(c) [\n\n]\n\nFIGURE 1. Experimental setup. (a) Outline map of Italy (from [35]) with Roman cities\ndiscs.

We call Physarum graph\nis because\n\nextracted from laboratory experiments are\nraw and Physarum graph\n\nstrong. This\n\nrepresents protoplasmic links developed in at least one experiments. The\n\ngraph\ngives us more reliable representation because its edges are represented by slime\nmould in third of all experiments.\nOne raw Physarum graph\ngraphs become planar for\n\nis non-planar due to edge Bononia to Roma (Fig. 2a).

When\nbecomes 10, Physarum graphs splits into northern component: the transport link between\nGenua and Florenzia becomes separated from the rest of the network (Fig. 2d) and Venusia\nbecomes isolated vertex.\nremains unchanged for\n, and 13. However when\nStructure of Physarum graph\nhalf of the cities become isolated vertexes: Genua, Aquileia, Piacentia, Filorenzia,\nReghium Reggio, and only two two-node transport chains sustain (Fig. 2e). The transport\nchains Capua \u2013 Venusia \u2013 Brundisium and Bononia \u2013 Ariminu \u2013 Roma (segments of Via\nAemelia and ViaFlamimia) are represented in half of the experiments.\n\n\f(a)\nFIGURE 3. Intersection of road graph\n\n(b)\nand Physarum graphs (a)\n\nand (b)\n\nFinding 1. Raw Physarum graph includes the road graph. Strong Physarum graph is\nincluded in the road graph.\nThis is because\n(compare Figs. 3a and 1b) and\n(compare Figs. 3b and 1b). The strong Physarum graph would provide perfect approximation\nof the road graph\nif roads from Piacentia to Bononia and from Genua to Florenzia were\nrepresented by protoplasmic tubes in over half of laboratory experiments.\nThe road graph\nand Physarum graphs\n,\n, are planar graphs. Roman builders\naimed to provide shortest transport connection between neighbouring cities while slime\nmould followed gradients of chemo-attractants emitted from oat flakes, representing the\nand\ncities. Therefore it would be reasonable to check what is the place of the graphs\nin the family of planar proximity graphs.\nA planar graph consists of nodes which are points of the Euclidean plane and edges which are\nstraight segments connecting the points. A planar proximity graph is a planar graph where\ntwo points are connected by an edge if they are close in some sense. A pair of points is\nassigned a certain neighbourhood, and points of the pair are connected by an edge if their\nneighbourhood is empty. Here we consider the most common proximity graph as follows.\n\u2022\n: Points\nand\nare connected by an edge in the Gabriel Graph\nif\ndisc with diameter\ncentred in middle of the segment\nis empty [10,17]\n(Fig. 4a).\n\u2022\n: Points\nand\nare connected by an edge in the Relative\nNeighbourhood Graph\nif no other point\nis closer to\nand\nthan\n[32] (Fig. 4b).\n\u2022\n: The Euclidean minimum spanning tree (MST) [22] is a connected\nacyclic graph which has minimum possible sum of edges' lengths (Fig. 4b).\nIn general, the graphs relate as\n[32,17,13]; this is called Toussaint\nhierarchy.\n\n\f(a)[\n\n]\n\n(b)[\n\n]\n\n(c)[MST](Rome)\nFIGURE 4.

Equality of spanning and relative neighbourhood\ngraph may be attributed to the fact that Italian peninsula is rather narrow yet long and\ntherefore planar proximity graphs built on U are heavily constrained.\n\nFinding 3. MST RNG GG\nThe raw Physarum is a sub-graph of three principle proximity graphs. This follows directly\nfrom Figs. 4 and 2a.\nStrong Physarum graph\ndoes not include MST because this Physarum graph does not\nrepresent transport links Placentia \u2013 Bononia and Genua \u2013 Florenzia.\n\n\fFIGURE 5. Intersection of strong Physarum graph and minimum spanning tree.\n\n4. Simulation\nThe simulation model is a particle based reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanism. Unlike classical\nRD models, which are composed of the interactions of two simulated activator/inhibitor\nreactants in a diffusive environment, there is only a single representative reactant a mobile\nparticle which senses and deposits simulated chemoattractant as it moves within a diffusive\nenvironment. The model is based on the LALI approach (Local Activation, Lateral\nInhibition) to RD pattern formation [8] that was used in [14] to generate emergent dynamical\ntransport networks.\nA population of mobile particles is created and initialised on a 2D lattice configured to the\nexperimental pattern of Italian cities. The diffusive medium is represented by a discrete twodimensional floating point lattice. Particle positions are stored on a discrete lattice isomorphic\nto the diffusive lattice. Particles also store internal floating point representations of positional\nand orientation which is rounded to a discrete value to compute movement updates and\nsensory inputs. A single particle, and an aggregation of particles, is related to the P.\npolycephalum plasmodium in the following way: The plasmodium is conceptualised as an\naggregate of identical components. Each particle represents a hypothetical unit of gel/sol\ninteraction. Gel refers to the relatively stiff sponge-like matrix composed of actin-myosin\nfibres and sol refers to the protoplasmic solution which flows within the matrix. The structure\nof the protoplasmic network is indicated by the particle positions and the flux of sol within\nthe network is represented by the movement of the particles. The resistance of the gel matrix\nto protoplasmic flux of sol is generated by particle-particle movement collisions.\n\n\f[Sensory stage]\n- Sample chemoattractant map values\n- if (F > FL) && (F > FR)\n- Continue facing same direction\n- Else if (F < FL) && (F < FR)\nRotate by RA towards larger of FL and FR\n- Else if (FL < FR)\nRotate right by RA\n- Else if (FR < FL)\nRotate left by RA\n- Else\nContinue facing same direction\n\n6. Single agent particle. (a) Morphology of agent showing sensors FL, F, FR and position C, (b) Sensory\nalgorithm.\n\nThe morphology of each particle is shown in Fig. 6a. The particle 'body' occupies a single\ncell in the lattice whose configuration is specified by a digitised greyscale image. Specific\ngreyscale values of the image represent habitat features such as empty habitable space,\nboundaries and food sources. Each particle has three sensors which sample the environment\nat some distance away (SO - sensor offset distance, in pixels) from the particle. The offset\nsensor positions generate local sensory coupling of the particle population. The cohesion of\nthe aggregate population is generated by the mutual attraction to the stimuli deposited by the\nparticles. The coupling of particle sensors and the autocatalytic nature of the particle\nmovement results in complex collective pattern formation and pattern evolution.\nThe sensory stage of the algorithm is given in Fig. 6b. Particles sense chemoattractant\nconcentration at lattice sites covered by the three sensors. At each scheduler step particles\norient towards the strongest concentration of local stimuli. Particle behaviour is very simple\nand is explicitly forward biased - the particle does not contemplate its current position \u00d0 so\nthere is an implicit emphasis on forward movement. By adjusting the SA/RA parameters a\nwide variety of reaction-diffusion patterning can be generated. The characteristics of the\npattern formation types and its parametric evaluation were discussed in [15].\nThe motor stage is executed after the sensory stage. Each particle attempts to move forward\nin its current direction (represented by an internal state from 0-360\u00b0). If the new site is\nvacant, the particle occupies the new site, depositing chemoattractant (5 arbitrary units) at the\nnew location. If the site is occupied no deposition is made and a new random orientation is\nselected. The particle population is iterated in a random order for both sensory and motor\nstages to avoid any influence from sequential updates. Each sensory and motor update,\ncombined with environmental diffusion of chemoattractant is considered as one scheduler\nstep.\nChemoattractant nutrient stimuli at city locations are projected to the diffusive map at every\nstep of the scheduler (2.55 units for low nutrient concentration and 255 units for high\nconcentration). This level of stimulus attracts the adapting virtual plasmodium and acts to\nconstrain the evolution of the network pattern. The chemoattractant stimuli are diffused by\nmeans of a simple 3 \u00d7 3 mean filter kernel. The diffusing chemoattractant values are damped\nby multiplying by 0.9 in order to adjust the strength of the diffusion gradient and the distance\nat which the plasmodium collective can sense the nutrients.\nGrowth and adaptation of the particle model population is currently implemented using a\n\n\fsimple method based upon local measures of space availability (growth) and overcrowding\n(adaptation by population reduction). Growth and shrinkage states are iterated separately for\neach particle at every two scheduler steps. For growth we assess if there are 1 to 10 particles\nin a 9 \u00d7 9 neighbourhood of a particle, and the particle has moved forwards successfully. If\nso, the particle attempts to divide into two if there is an empty location in the immediate\nneighbourhood surrounding the particle. For shrinkage we assess if there are 0 to 24 particles\nin a 5 \u00d7 5 neighbourhood of a particle. If so, the particle survives, otherwise it is annihilated.\n\n4.1. Simulation Results\nThe topology of P. polycephalum transport networks is, in part, influenced by unpredictable\ninfluences on its formation, for example, the initial migration direction of the plasmodium or\nthe presence of previously laid down protoplasmic tubes. This raises the question as to\nwhether the topology of the networks would be more regular under idealised adaptation\nconditions. In order to minimise this unpredictability we initialised the simulation model with\na uniform distribution of a fully grown virtual plasmodium to solely assess the effect of the\nspatial arrangement of nutrients (corresponding to city locations) had on the morphological\nadaptation of the virtual transport network. The results of an example evolution of the virtual\nplasmodium are shown in Fig. 7. Uniform coverage was attained by populating 50% of the\nhabitable area of Italy with 14789 particles. The simulation was started and the collective\nadapted to the nutrient stimuli by shrinking in size to form a transport network connecting the\ncity locations and avoiding the mountainous regions. Twenty runs of the simulation were\nperformed at both low and high nutrient concentration.\nWe used the same method of assessing connectivity between cities as in the experimental\napproach and this resulted in an adjacency matrix containing the frequency connected nodes\nfor the 20 experiments in both nutrient conditions. The connectivity graphs at different\nthreshold weights are shown in Fig. 8 for low nutrient concentrations and Fig. 9 for high\nnutrient concentrations.\n\nat low nutrient concentration and\n{Placentia,\nFinding 4.\nBolonia} at high nutrient concentration.\nThe higher the attractive value of nodes the more likely virtual slime mould connect the\nnodes with a minimum spanning tree.\n\nFinding 5.\nThe results demonstrate that the idealised virtual plasmodium redundantly represent\ngeneralised Physarum. Moreover, strong components Bononia - Ariminum - Roma and\nCapua - Venusia - Brundisium are represented by\n\nand\n\n.\n\n\fFIGURE 7.

Conclusions\nExperimental laboratory studies and computer simulations confirmed that P. polycephalum\nmatch the street network to a certain degree. Based on the laboratory experiments we can\npropose the following sequence of road network development in Italian peninsula. At the\ninitial stage Roma is linked with Corfinium, Capua and Reate (Fig. 10a). Next stage is\ncharacterised by northbound development: the roads are built to Populonia, Clusium and\nAriminum (Fig. 10b). The propagation continuation towards northern parts till Roma is\nconnected with Genua, Placentia, Verona, Aquileia and Pola (Fig. 10c). After the northern\npart of Italian peninsula is well serviced with roads the development starts southward. The\nroads are built from Capua to Brundisiu and Rhegnium (Fig. 10b). Such development is\nsubstantially matched by dynamics of a spanning tree growing from Roma 11.\nBy comparing the road network and slime mould networks with proximity graphs we found\nthat in this particular of Italian peninsula the road networks and slime mould networks show\nhigh degree of affinity to spanning trees and relative neighbourhood graphs (see also [36,37]\nfor use of proximity graphs in simulation of urban networks). This could be a sign that\nRoman transportation system, developed in ancient times, was based on strict mathematical\nlogic but also possessed all features of bio-logic, at least as related to reasoning at the level of\namorphous spatially distributed living creatures.\n\n\f\fFigure 12. Growth of a spanning tree routed in Roma, on cities used as nodes in illustration\nFig. 10. Nodes occupied by \"active zones\", or growth cones of the tree, are encircled.\n\nFIGURE 12. Similarity between evolution of road networks in Italian peninsula and corresponding\nprotoplasmic networks. (a) Early protoplasmic tube network, (b) After tube network adaptation (20m),\n(c) Primordial Etrurian trails (approx V Sec b.C.) [35], (d) Imperial Roman Street Networks (I Sec.\na.C) [35].\n\n\fThe results are encouraging and inspire us to undertake further investigations. For example,\nduring laboratory experiments we noticed striking similarities between sprouting, scouting\nand space-searching executed by P. polycephalum and evolution of transport networks in the\nTuscany region of the Italian peninsula (Fig. 12). The pre-Roman road networks in this\nregion show signs of rather extensive exploration of the space (Fig. 12c). The same strategy\nis explored by slime mould during its initial stage of substrate colonisation (Fig. 12a). With\ntime - due to implicit competition between roads - only a few roads are selected by the\nmasses of travellers, as e.g. Etrurian paths in the Tuscany region (Fig. 12d). The same\nselection of few transport links occurs in protoplasmic networks of P. polycephalum\n(Fig. 12b) as protoplasmic tubes with lesser flux are eradicated. We believe our experiments\nwill lead to further extensive experiments on bio-inspired urban developments boosted by\npaleotopography, particle-based modes of large-scale collectives and nature-inspired\ncomputing.\n\nReferences\n[1] Adamatzky A.
