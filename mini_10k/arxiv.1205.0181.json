An effective approach to maximize the sum utility (e.g., system throughput) in such a network is to jointly optimize users' linear procoders as well as their base station associations.

Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm can effectively relieve local BS congestion\nand simultaneously achieve high throughput and load balancing in a heterogeneous network.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nConsider a multicell heterogeneous network (HetNet) in which every cell is installed with not only a macro base\nstation (BS) but also a set of micro/pico/femto base stations, all equipped with multiple antennas and sharing the\nsame frequency band. In such a network, the users are often simultaneously covered by multiple BSs with different\ncapabilities and load status. If the users in a HetNet are assigned to BSs simply according to their received signal\nstrengths (as is done in conventional cellular networks), then a BS located close to a hot spot may experience severe\ncongestion, causing poor quality of service in the network. Indeed, it has been shown that the signal strength based\napproach for user-BS association in a HetNet can be highly suboptimal for congestion management and fairness\nprovisioning [2], [3]. For a HetNet, the overall system performance depends not only on the physical layer choices\nof precoder design and power control, but also on how the users and the BSs are associated. Consequently, BS\nassignment should be an integral part of physical layer optimization of the overall system performance.\nThis research is supported by the AFOSR, Grant No. 00008547.\nM. Hong and Z.-Q. Luo are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN\n55455, USA\nA conference version of this paper has been presented in IEEE ICASSP 2012 [1].\n\n\f2\n\nConventionally, physical layer resource management and network performance optimization involve such aspects\nas transceiver design, power control and spectrum management, while the user-BS assignment is assumed known\nand fixed. For example, under this assumption, game theoretic approaches have been used to design optimal transmit\nprecoders for a MIMO interference channel (MIMO-IC). The authors of [4], [5], among others, propose to formulate\nthe transmit covariance matrix optimization problem as a noncooperative game in which the transmitters/users\ncompete with each other for transmission. Reference [6] further takes into consideration the robustness issue of the\nproblem. In these studies, each user selfishly maximizes its own transmission rate, while treating all other users'\ninterference as noise. Simple distributed algorithms (based on iterative water-filling) are derived with convergence\nguarantees, but the resulting solutions of the game are inefficient in terms of system throughput. This is due to both\nthe lack of coordination among the transmitters/users and the choice of utility functions which do not consider the\ninterference effect on other users in the system.\nIn addition to the competitive design, we can also design transmit precoders by maximizing a suitable system\nutility function. Unfortunately, most optimization problems in this category have been proven to be NP-hard in\nvarious settings [7]\u2013[10]. As a result, many authors focus on developing efficient algorithms to compute high\nquality sub-optimal solutions for these problems, e.g., in MIMO-IC, [11], [12], MISO-IC [13]\u2013[15] and MIMO-IC\nwith a single data stream per user [16], [17]. In particular, references [11], [12] propose an iterative algorithm based\non the first order Taylor approximation of the nonconcave part of the weighted sum rate (WSR) objective. It is\nshown that the WSR values generated by this algorithm increase monotonically, but the convergence of the users'\ntransmit covariances (to a stationary solution) is left unproven. For the problem of maximizing a general utility\nfunction, reference [8] proposes a cyclic ascent method for linear precoder design in a MISO network. The proposed\nalgorithm can deal with any smooth utility functions and is known to converge to a stationary solution. Reference\n[9] develops an algorithm that optimizes the Max-Min utility in a MIMO network by adapting the transmit and\nreceive precoders alternately. References [18], [19] propose a weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE)\nalgorithm in which the transmitters and receivers iteratively update their linear transmit and receive strategies to\noptimize the system utility function. The authors show that as long as the system utility function satisfies some\nmild regularity conditions, their algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the problem.\nAll of the above cited works aim at optimizing the linear transceiver structures under the assumption that the\ntransmitter-receiver association is known and fixed. The problem of joint cell site selection and power allocation\nin the traditional CDMA based network has been first considered in [20]\u2013[22] and later in a game theoretical\nperspective in [23], [24]. The objective of the network optimization is to minimize the users' total transmit power\nsubject to a set of individual SNR constraints. In these works, the users optimize their uplink power levels and/or\ntransmit beams as well as their BS associations. The phenomenon of \"cell breathing\" is observed whereby the sizes\nof the cells dynamically change according to the congestion levels. Recently references [25]\u2013[27] have considered\nthe joint BS selection and vector power allocation in OFDMA networks in which the BSs operate on non-overlapping\nspectrum. The users compete with each other for resources in each cell, and at the same time they are able to freely\n\n\f3\n\nchoose to use any (non-interfering) BS in the network. However, it is not clear how these works can be generalized\nto the considered MIMO-HetNet scenario. Reference [28] is a recent work in such direction. Differently from the\npresent work, a downlink HetNet setting is considered. As a result, the user-BS association is determined in a\ncentralized fashion, which is very different than the distributed solutions to be presented in this work.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of joint optimization of linear precoder and BS assignment for an uplink\nMIMO heterogeneous network. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.\n1) We establish the NP-hardness of the joint precoder design and user-BS assignment problem for the weighted\nsum rate (WSR) maximization in a MIMO-HetNet. This NP-hardness result is intrinsically different from the\nexisting complexity results [7]\u2013[10] for the linear precoder design problem where the user-BS assignment\nis fixed. In particular, for the latter results, the NP-hardness of the precoder design problem lies in how to\ndetermine which users/antennas should be turned off due to strong interference links. However, when the\nuser-BS assignment is not fixed, a strong interference link can be turned into a direct link by changing the\nuser-BS association, thus effectively mitigating the level of interference. As a result, what makes the joint\nuser-BS association and precoder design problem difficult is not the presence of strong interference links, but\nrather its mixed interference pattern. Therefore, the NP-hardness of the joint optimization problem does not\nfollow from, nor imply, any of the existing complexity results [7]\u2013[10] for the linear precoder design problem\nwhen the user-BS assignment is fixed.\n2) We propose a novel game theoretic formulation to find a local WSR-optimal solution of the joint precoder\ndesign and user-BS assignment problem for a MIMO heterogeneous network. In the proposed game both\nthe transmitters and the BSs act as players. We introduce a set of utility functions for the players and show\nthat every NE of the resulting game, which gives a set of precoders and user-BS assignment for all users in\nthe network, is a stationary solution of the WSR maximization problem. To reach a NE of the game, each\ntransmitter greedily determines the best linear precoder as well as the least congested BS for transmission,\nwhereas each BS computes a set of optimal prices to charge the users for causing interference. These prices\nserve to coordinate the behavior of the users so that they do not cause excessive interference in the network.\nWe show that the resulting distributed algorithm converges to a NE of the game. Notice that the convergence\nof the algorithm implies that the network will be stable in the sense that no user will change BSs indefinitely.\nSimulation results show that this algorithm is very effective in relieving local BS congestion and achieving\nhigh throughput and load balancing in the network.\nWe remark that when the user-BS assignment is fixed, our proposed game reduces to the standard precoder\noptimization game. In this context, the users are again charged with a set of prices that reflect their (negative)\ninfluence to other users. Thus, our problem formulation can be viewed as a generalization of previous results for\ninterference pricing (e.g. [11], [15], [16], [29]) to the MIMO interfering multiple access channel (MIMO-IMAC)\nsetting with general system utility functions.\n\n\f4\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give the system level description of the problem,\nand provide its complexity analysis. In Section III and Section IV, we formulate the problem into a non-cooperative\ngame framework, and study the properties of the resulting games. Furthermore we propose an efficient algorithm\nto compute the equilibrium solutions of the games. In Section V, we present numerical results to demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm. Some concluding remarks are given in Section VI.\nNotations: For a symmetric matrix X, X \u0017 0 signifies that X is positive semi-definite. We use Tr(X), |X|,\n\nXH , \u03bb(X) and Rank(X) to denote the trace, determinant, Hermitian, spectral radius and the rank of a matrix,\n\nrespectively. We use In to denote a n \u00d7 n identity matrix, and use [y, x\u2212i ] to denote a vector x with its ith elements\n\nreplaced by y . Moreover, we let RN \u00d7M and CN \u00d7M denote the set of real and complex N \u00d7 M matrices, and\n\nuse SN and SN\n+ to denote the set of N \u00d7 N Hermitian and Hermitian semi-definite matrices, respectively.

Let a be a N \u00d7 1 vector representing the system association profile, i.e., an = q\nmeans user n connects to BS q .\nSuppose each user n \u2208 N has Tn transmit antennas and each BS q \u2208 Q has Rq receive antennas. Let Hq,n \u2208\n\nCRq \u00d7Tn be the channel matrix from transmitter n to receiver q . Assume Tn \u2264 Rq for all (n, q) \u2208 (N \u00d7 Q), or\nequivalently the channel matrices {Hq,n } are tall matrices. This assumption is reasonable as the number of antennas\nat the BS is typically larger than that of the mobile users.\nLet xn \u2208 CTn and yq \u2208 CRq denote the transmitted signal of user n and the received signal of BS q , respectively.\nThen yq can be expressed as\nyq =\n\nX\n\nHq,n xn + zq\n\n(1)\n\nn\u2208N\n\nwhere zq \u223c CN (0, \u03c3q2 IRq ) is the additive white complex Gaussian noise vector. Suppose there are a maximum of Tn\n\ndata streams transmitted by user n and its data symbol vector is denoted by sn \u2208 CTn .

Once the covariance\n\nmatrix Sn is computed, the precoder can be obtained by Cholesky factorization.

The 3-SAT problem is described as follows. Given M disjunctive clauses C1 , * * * , CM\ndefined on N Boolean variables X1 * * * , XN , i.e., Cm = t1 \u2228 t2 \u2228 t3 with ti \u2208 {X1 , * * * , XN , X\u03041 , * * * , X\u0304N }, the\nproblem is to check whether there exists a truth assignment for the Boolean variables such that all clauses are\nsatisfied (i.e., each clause evaluates to 1) simultaneously. We leave the details of the proof to the Appendix A. We\nnote that our complexity result differs from the recent result in [28], in which the complexity for the joint user-BS\nassociation and precoder design problem is analyzed for the downlink direction.\nMotivated by the above complexity result, we focus on designing low complexity algorithms that can provide\n\n\f6\n\napproximately optimal solutions. In particular, we will consider in the sequel a more general system level problem\nformulated as the following sum utility maximization problem\nmax\nS,a\n\nf (S; a)\n\ns.t. f (S; a) ,\n\n(SYS-U)\nX\n\nfn (Rn (S; a)) ,\n\nRn (S; a) defined in (3),\n\nn\u2208N\n\nTr(Sn ) \u2264 p\u0304n , Sn \u2208 ST+n , \u2200 n \u2208 N\nan \u2208 Q, \u2200 n \u2208 N\n\nwhere fn (*) : R+ \u2192 R is the utility function of user n's data rate. We make the following assumptions on fn (*):\nA-1) fn (x) is strictly increasing, concave and coercive in x for all x \u2265 0;\nA-2) fn (\u2212 log(|X|)) is strictly convex in X for all X \u0017 0.\nNote that this family of utility functions includes well known utilities such as weighted sum rate, proportional\nfairness and the harmonic mean rate utility functions (see [18]).\nIn the sequel, we will develop a distributed algorithm to compute a local stationary solution for the problem\n(SYS-U). Our main approach is based on the noncooperative game theory.\nIII. T RANSMIT C OVARIANCE O PTIMIZATION G AME\n\nFOR\n\nF IXED U SER -BS A SSOCIATION\n\nTo simplify the presentation of the game theoretic approach, we first consider the case in which the user-BS\nassignment is fixed in advance, and the users are only allowed to optimize their transmit covariances. We will\ndesign a noncooperative game whose equilibrium solutions correspond to the stationary solutions of the sum utility\nmaximization problem (SYS-U). Extension to the general case with flexible association will be presented in the\nnext section.\nA. Problem Formulation\nWhen the user-BS association is fixed, the sum utility maximization problem (SYS-U) can be restated as\nmax f (S)\n\n(SUM)\n\nS\n\ns.t. Tr(Sn ) \u2264 p\u0304n , Sn \u2208 ST+n , \u2200 n \u2208 N .\n\nSuppose each user n \u2208 N can optimize its transmit covariance Sn . Its feasible set is given by\no\nn\nFn , Sn | Tr(Sn ) \u2264 p\u0304n , Sn \u2208 ST+n .\nDefine the joint feasible set of all the users as F ,\n\nQ\n\nn\u2208N\n\n(6)\n\nFn .\n\nIn order to mitigate interference caused by unintended users, we allow each BS q \u2208 Q to post a (matrix valued)\ni\nhP\nT\nS\nprice Tq,n \u2208 CRq to each user n \u2208 N . That is, each user n incurs a total charge of Tr\nq\u2208Q q,n n for the\n\n\f7\n\nQ\ninterference contributed to all the BSs in the network. Define Hq = n\u2208N CRq as the feasible set of BS q 's pricing\nQ\nstrategies. Define H , q\u2208Q Hq as the joint feasible set of all the BSs. Let Tq = {Tq,n }n\u2208N , Tn = {Tq,n }q\u2208Q ,\n\nand T = {Tq }q\u2208Q .\n\nWe model both the users and the BSs as selfish players in a noncooperative game. The players are interested in\nchoosing their individual optimal strategies (transmit covariances for the users, and price matrices for the BSs) to\nmaximize their own utility functions Un (*) and Dq (*). We formulate a covariance optimization game G C as follows\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\b\n\b\nC\nG , {N , Q}, F, H , {Un (*)}n\u2208N , {Dq (*)}q\u2208Q .\n\nWe need to properly specify the utility functions Un (*) and Dq (*) so that the equilibriums of the game G C correspond\nto the local stationary solution of the sum utility maximization problem (SUM).\n\nB. The BSs' Utility Maximization Problem\nThe BSs' utility functions and their maximization problems are closely related to the structure of the desired\ninterference prices. As a result, we start by providing an explicit construction of the interference prices. Let us\ndefine Nq , {n : an = q} as the set of users associated with BS q . Define \u03b1m (S) as the derivative of user m's\nutility function w.r.t. to its rate\n\u03b1m (S) ,\n\n\u2202fm (x)\n\u2202x\n\n>0\n\n(7)\n\nx=Rm (S)\n\nwhere the positivity of \u03b1m (S) comes from the condition A-1), i.e., fm (*) is a strictly increasing function. Then at\na given system covariance S, user n's negative marginal influence to the sum utility of users currently associated\nto BS q is given by\n\u2212\n=\n\nX\n\n\u25bdSn fm (Rm (S))\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\nX\n\n\u0001\u22121\nH\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nHq,m Sm HH\n\u03b1m (S)HH\nq,m Cm (S\u2212m )Hq,n\nq,n Cm (S\u2212m ) IRq + Hq,m Sm Hq,m Cm (S\u2212m )\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\n=\n\nHH\nq,n\n\n\u0012\n\nX\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121\nH\n\u22121\n2\n2 H\n\u03b1m (S)G\u22121\nq (S)Hq,m Sm Em (S)(Sm ) Hq,m Gq (S)\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\nHq,n \u0017 0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere in the last equality we have again used the fact that\n1\n\n1\n\nH H\n\u22121\n2\n2\nE\u22121\nm (S) = I + (Sm ) Ham ,m Cm (S\u2212m )Ham ,m Sm .\n\n(9)\n\nWe propose to mitigate the interference generated by a user n \u2208 N by charging it a penalty proportionally to\nits negative marginal influence. Specifically, the interference price takes the following form\nTq,n , \u2212\n\nX\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\n\u25bdSn fm (Rm (S)) \u0017 0.\n\n(10)\n\n\f8\n\nThis definition of interference price leads to the following definition of a BS q 's utility function\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nX\nDq (Tq , T\u2212q , S) , \u2212\nTq,n\u2212 \u2212\n\u25bdSn fm (Rm (S)) .\n\n(11)\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\nn\u2208N\n\nClearly, for a fixed S \u2208 F , the set of prices that maximizes BS q 's utility are given by (10). In what follows,\nTq,n (S) is occasionally used to explicitly indicate the dependency of the prices on the users' transmit covariances.\n\nC. The Users' Utility Maximization Problem\nTo strike a balance between the user's desire to improve its utility and the need to reduce its interference in the\nnetwork, we modify each user's utility as the difference between its true utility and the interference charge\nUn (Sn , S\u2212n , Tn ) , fn (Rn (Sn , S\u2212n )) \u2212\n\nX\n\nTr [Tq,n Sn ] .\n\n(12)\n\nq\u2208Q\n\nWith this modification, each user's utility maximization problem is given by\nmax Un (Sn , S\u2212n , Tn ).\n\n(13)\n\nSn \u2208Fn\n\nNote that the function fn (Rn (Sn , S\u2212n )) is a strictly concave function in Sn , as it is a composition of a strictly\nincreasing and concave function (i.e., fn (*)) and a strictly concave function of Sn (i.e., Rn (*)) (see [33, Section\n3.2.4]). As a result, problem (13) has a strictly concave objective value and admits a unique solution. In the\nfollowing, we develop an efficient procedure to compute such solution.\nP\nFix a user n \u2208 N , let q = an . Let An , l\u2208Q Tl,n \u0017 0. Using these notations, user n's utility maximization\nproblem (13) can be written as\n\n\u22121\nmax fn log I + Hq,n Sn HH\nq,n Cn\n\nSn \u2208Fn\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2212 Tr[An Sn ].\n\n(14)\n\nThe Lagrangian of this problem is given by\n\u22121\nL(Sn , \u03bcn ) = fn log I + Hq,n Sn HH\nq,n Cn\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2212 Tr[(An + \u03bcn I)Sn ] + \u03bcn p\u0304n\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03bcn \u2265 0 is the Lagrangian multiplier for the power constraint. The dual function is d(\u03bcn ) = maxSn \u00170 L(Sn , \u03bcn ).\n\nThe optimal primal-dual pair (S\u2217n , \u03bc\u2217n ) should satisfy the KKT optimality conditions\nS\u2217n = arg max L(Sn , \u03bc\u2217n ), S\u2217n \u0017 0\nSn \u2208Fn\n\n0 \u2264 \u03bc\u2217n \u22a5 (p\u0304n \u2212 Tr[S\u2217n ]) \u2265 0.\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nFor any fixed \u03bcn \u2265 0, the solution to the problem arg maxSn \u2208Fn L(Sn , \u03bcn ) can be obtained as follows. Using\n\nthe fact that An \u0017 0, then for any \u03bcn > 0, we can perform the Cholesky decomposition An + \u03bcn I = LH\nn Ln , which\n\n\f9\n\nH\nresults in Tr[(An + \u03bcn I)Sn ] = Tr[Ln Sn LH\nn ]. Define S\u0304n (\u03bcn ) , Ln Sn Ln , then we have\n\n\u0001\n\u2212H H\nL(Sn , \u03bcn ) = fn log Cn + Hq,n L\u22121\nn S\u0304n (\u03bcn )Ln Hq,n + c1 \u2212 Tr[S\u0304n (\u03bcn )] + \u03bcn p\u0304n\n\u0001\n(i)\n\u22121\n\u2212H H\n\u2212H\n= fn log I + B\u22121\n+ c2 \u2212 Tr[S\u0304n (\u03bcn )] + \u03bcn p\u0304n\nn Hq,n Ln S\u0304n (\u03bcn )Ln Hq,n Bn\n\u0001\n(ii)\nH\n= fn log I + Fn \u2206n MH\nn S\u0304n (\u03bcn )Mn \u2206n Fn + c2 \u2212 Tr[S\u0304n (\u03bcn )] + \u03bcn p\u0304n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(iii)\nb n (\u03bcn )] + \u03bcn p\u0304n , L(S\nb n (\u03bcn ))\nb n (\u03bcn )\u2206n + c3 \u2212 Tr[S\n= fn log I + \u2206n S\n\n(18)\n\nwhere c1 , c2 , c3 are some constants that are not related to Sn . In step (i) we have used the Cholesky decomposition:\nH\n\u22121\n\u22121\nCn = Bn BH\nn ; in (ii) we have used the singular value decomposition Bn Hq,n Ln = Fn \u2206n Mn ; in (iii) we have\n\nb n (\u03bcn ) = MH\ndefined S\nn S\u0304n (\u03bcn )Mn and used the fact that Mn and Fn are unitary matrices. Note that if \u03bcn = 0\n\nand An is not full rank, we can use generalized inverse to replace L\u22121\nn . We then argue that the (unique) optimal\nb \u2217 (\u03bcn ) to the following problem must be diagonal\nsolution S\nn\n\nb n (\u03bcn )).\nmax L(S\n\n(19)\n\nb n (\u03bcn )\u00170\nS\n\nb n (\u03bcn )\u2206n \u227b 0. Then from the Hadamard inequality [31], we can\nAssume the contrary. Note that we have I + \u2206n S\nb \u2217n (\u03bcn )\u2206n\nalways remove the off-diagonal elements of the optimal solution and increase the value of log I + \u2206n S\n\nb \u2217 (\u03bcn )] unchanged. Since fn (x) is a strictly increasing function, the objective value\nwhile keeping the value of Tr[S\nn\n\nis also increased, a contradiction to the optimality of the non-diagonal solution.\n\nb n (\u03bcn )]i,i .

First suppose (S\u2217 , T\u2217 ) is a NE of the game. Then from the\n\ndefinition of NE we have that for any Sn \u2208 Fn and n \u2208 N , Un (S\u2217n , S\u2217\u2212n , T\u2217n ) \u2265 Un (Sn , S\u2217\u2212n , T\u2217n ). Using (25),\nwe have R(S\u2217n , S\u2217\u2212n ) \u2265 R(Sn , S\u2217\u2212n ) for all Sn \u2208 Fn . This means S\u2217n = arg maxSn \u2208Fn R(Sn , S\u2217\u2212n ), \u2200 n \u2208 N . We\n\ncan verify that the KKT condition of this N problems is the same as the KKT condition of the original (SUM)\nproblem. The other direction can be proved similarly.\nIV.

Let J\u2212n ,\n(S\u2212n , a\u2212n ), and J , {Jn }n\u2208N . In this case, each user's rate is still defined by (3), but we have to make the\n\ndependency of association profile explicit. We use Rn (Jn , J\u2212n ) to denote user n's rate. We use Cn (S\u2212n , [q, a\u2212n ])\nto denote the interference covariance that user n would have experienced if it selects BS q , while all other users\nuse the strategy (S\u2212n , a\u2212n ). Let Nq (a) denote the set of users associated with BS q under association profile a.\nMoreover, to make the dependence of the sum utility maximization problem on the underlying user-BS association\nexplicit, we use SUM(a) to denote the sum utility maximization problem when the association profile is chosen as\na.\n\nLet \u016an (*) and D\u0304q (*) denote user n and BS q 's utility functions, respectively.

In order to\nemphasize the relationship between the optimal solution of BS q and the users' strategies J, we occasionally use\nTq,n (J) or Tq,n (S, a) (resp. T(J) or T(S, a)) to denote the optimal prices charged by BS q to user n (resp. the\n\nset of prices charged by all the BSs).\nThe pure NE of the game G J is the tuple (J\u2217 , T\u2217 ) that satisfies\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u016an J\u2217n , J\u2217\u2212n T\u2217n \u2265 \u016an Jn , J\u2217\u2212n , T\u2217n , \u2200 Jn \u2208 Jn , \u2200 n \u2208 N\n\nD\u0304q (T\u2217q , T\u2217\u2212q , J\u2217 ) \u2265 D\u0304q (Tq , T\u2217\u2212q , J\u2217 ), \u2200 Tq \u2208 Hq , \u2200 q \u2208 Q.\n\nThe game G J with the utility functions defined above again possesses the \"generalized potential\" property, which\n\nis essential in establishing the correspondence between the pure NEs of game G J and the stationary solutions of\nthe sum-utility maximization problem.\nProposition 2: For any utility function fn (*) that satisfies the assumptions A-1) and A-2), we have\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nb\u2212n Tn (J)\nb \u2212 \u016an J\nbn , J\nb\u2212n Tn (J)\nb >0\n\u016an Jn , J\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\u2212n \u2212 f J\nbn \u2208 J n , J\nb\u2212n \u2208 J\u2212n .\nbn , J\nb\u2212n > 0, \u2200 Jn , J\n=\u21d2 f Jn , J\n\n(29)\n\nThe proof of this proposition is relegated to Appendix D.

Fortunately, by utilizing Proposition 2, we can extend our\n\nargument in the proof of Theorem 2 to show the following existence result of the NE of game G J .\n\nTheorem 3: The game G J must admit at least one pure NE. Moreover, if (S\u2217 , a\u2217 , T\u2217 ) is a NE of the game G J ,\n\nthen S\u2217 must be a KKT solution of the problem SU M (a\u2217 ).\n\ne a\ne), along with the correProof: We first claim that the global optimal solution of problem (SYS), say (S,\n\ne a\ne) is a NE of the game G J .

The second part of the theorem can be shown following the same\nwhich contradicts the global optimality of (S,\n\nproof in Theorem 2.\n\nIn the following, we propose a distributed algorithm for the users to reach a NE of the game G J . Central\n\nto the proposed algorithm is the procedure developed in the previous section that allows the users to compute\ntheir transmit covariance matrices. The algorithm works by alternating between the users' and the BSs' utility\nmaximization problems. In each iteration t, a single user n \u2208 N updates its transmit covariance and BS association\nby solving its utility maximization problem\n(Stn , atn ) = arg\n\nmax\n\n(Sn ,an )\u2208Jn\n\n\u0001\nt\u22121\n.\n\u016an (Sn , an ), Jt\u22121\n\u2212n , Tn\n\n(32)\n\nThen all the BSs update their interference prices by solving their respective utility maximization problems\nt\nTtq = arg max D\u0304q (Tq , Tt\u22121\n\u2212q , J ), \u2200 q \u2208 Q.\nTq\n\n(33)\n\nEach user's utility optimization problem (32) can be performed by the following two steps: a) solve Q inner\ncovariance optimization problems maxSn \u2208Fn \u016an ((Sn , q), J\u2212n , Tn ), one for each BS q \u2208 Q (each of these problems\ncan be solved using the procedure listed in Table II in Section III); b) pick the best BS in terms of the optimal\nvalue of the inner covariance optimization problem.\nThe proposed algorithm naturally incorporates the joint optimization of BS association and linear precoder into\nindividual mobile users' optimization problem. The detailed algorithm is listed in Table III.\nTABLE III\nA D ISTRIBUTED B EST-R ESPONSE A LGORITHM\n\nS1) Initialization: Let t = 0, each user n \u2208 N randomly choose J0n \u2208 Jn ;\neach BS q \u2208 Q set T0q = 0.\nP\nS2) Choose a user n \u2208 N .

We briefly remark on the distributed implementation of the algorithm.\nThe following three assumptions are needed for this purpose. First, local channel information is known by each\n\n\f15\n\nuser, that is, each user n has the knowledge of {Hq,n }q\u2208Q . Second, each BS has a feedback channel to all the\npotential users. Third, each BS knows the utility function of the users that are associated with it.\nUnder these assumptions, the proposed algorithm can be implemented distributedly. At iteration t, each BS q can\ncompute the price Ttq,n locally by measuring the total received signal variance Gq (St ) and computing the MMSE\nmatrix Em (St ) of each associated user m \u2208 Nq (cf (5) and (8)). Suppose user n is scheduled to update at iteration\n\nt. Then all the BSs can broadcast their pricing information Ttq,n for user n as well as their total received signal\n\ncovariance Gq (St ) (note, due to symmetry, only upper triangular parts of these matrices need to be transmitted).\nUpon receiving all this information, user n can carry out its utility maximization locally.\nMoreover, when the network is operated in a time division duplex (TDD) mode, the information that needs to\nbe broadcast can be significantly reduced. This reduction is made possible by utilizing the following two facts:\n1) in TDD mode, the uplink channels can be viewed as the Hermitian transpose of its reverse channels (i.e.,\nP\nt\nHq,n = HH\nn,q ); 2) each user n only needs the sum of all the prices charged for it:\nq\u2208Q Tq,n . Specifically, the BSs\n\ndo not need to broadcast the pricing information for user n explicitly. Each BS q only needs to broadcast Gq (St )\nby using the following transmit covariance matrix\nX\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u22121\nH H\n\u22121\n2\n2\n\u03b1m (S)G\u22121\nq (S)Hq,m Sm Em (S)(Sm ) Hq,m Gq (S).\n\n(34)\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\nThis matrix can be calculated once BS q obtains the measurement of the total received signal variance Gq (St )\nand computes the MMSE matrix Em (St ), for all m \u2208 Nq (at ). In this way, user n can decode the messages and\n\nmeasure the total received signal covariance expressed as\nX\n\nq\u2208Q\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\nHH\nq,n\n\nX\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u22121\nH H\n\u22121\n\uf8f8\n\u03b1m (S)G\u22121\nq (S)Hq,m Sm Em (S)(Sm ) Hq,m Gq (S) Hq,n .\n\nm\u2208Nq \\n\n\nBy the definition of prices in (8) and (10), the received signal covariance is precisely the total price\n\n(35)\n\nP\n\nt\nq\u2208Q Tq,n .\n\nIn the following we provide the convergence result of the proposed algorithm. The details of the proof are\npresented in Appendix E.\nTheorem 4: The sequence {f (St , at )}\u221e\nt=1 generated by the proposed algorithm is monotonically increasing and\n\nJ\nalways converges. Any limit point of {St , at , Tt }\u221e\nt=1 is a NE of the game G .\n\nWe remark that the proposed algorithm can also be applied to the scenario in which the user-BS assignment is\nfixed. In this case the users only need to perform a single inner optimization in S3). An immediate consequence\nof Theorem 4 is that this reduced form of the algorithm also converges to the NE of the game G C .\n\nCorollary 1: When the user-BS assignment is fixed, the sequence {f (St )}\u221e\nt=1 generated by the proposed algorithm\n\nC\nis monotonically increasing and converges. Any limit point of {St , Tt }\u221e\nt=1 is a NE of the game G .\n\nThis corollary generalizes the convergence result presented in [37], which deals with only the single antenna\ncase and is limited to the weighted sum rate utility. Furthermore, it establishes the convergence for the algorithm\nproposed in [11], [12], since the latter is a specialization of our algorithm to the case where the user-BS association\n\n\f16\n\nis fixed and the system utility is the weighted sum rate function.\nV. N UMERICAL R ESULTS\nIn this section, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the WMMSE algorithm [18]. The\nlatter is known to be an effective method to solve the sum utility maximization problem for the MIMO interference\nchannel, except that it requires the user-BS assignment to be fixed. To facilitate the comparison, we fix the user-BS\nassignment for the WMMSE algorithm using the received signal strengths, as is done in the conventional cellular\nnetworks. We demonstrate that the distributed algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve a higher spectrum\nefficiency and more effective load balancing in a HetNet than the WMMSE algorithm.\nWe consider a single macro cell in a HetNet. The macro cell consists of 7 pico cells, each containing 1 pico BS, and\nhas a total of 16 users. The distance between adjacent pico BSs is 200 meters (representing a dense macro cell with\nsmall pico cell sizes). Let dq,n denote the distance between pico BS q and user n. The entries of the channel Hq,n\n3.5\n2 ), where the standard deviation is given by \u03c3\nare generated from distribution CN (0, \u03c3q,n\nLq,n ,\nq,n = (200/dq,n )\n\nand 10 log 10(Lq,n ) \u223c N (0, 8) is used to model the shadowing effect. We fix the environment noise power as\n\u03c3q = 1, \u2200 q \u2208 Q, and let all users have the same transmit power limit p\u0304n = p\u0304, \u2200 n \u2208 N . We define the signal to\n\nnoise ratio as SNR , 10 log 10 p\u0304.\n13\n12\n\nProposed Algorithm\nWMMSE\n\n1\n\n11\n\nT =4, R =4\nq\n\nn\n\n9\nT =4, R =4\nn\n\n8\n\nTn=4, Rq=8\n\n0.6\n\nq\n\nCDF\n\nAveraged User Rate\n\n0.8\n10\n\n7\n\nT =4, R =8\nq\n\n0.4\n\nn\n\n6\n5\n\n0.2\n\nProposed algorithm\n\n4\n3\n\u221215\n\nWMMSE algorithm\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n10\nSNR(dB)\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\nIndividual Rate\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of the performance of the proposed algorithm and the WMMSE algorithm when the proportional fair utility is used.\nN = 16, Q = 7, users are all located at the cell edges. Left: comparison of the users' averaged rates. Right: comparison of the CDF of\nusers' achieved rates.\n\nWe first consider a scenario in which the users are all located at the pico cell edges, and one of the pico\nBSs is congested. In particular, we place half of the users uniformly at the cell edges of BS 1, which is within\nd1,n \u2208 [90, 100] meters. We place the rest of the users randomly at the cell edges of other pico BSs. For the\n\nWMMSE algorithm, we let the users associate to the pico BSs with the strongest direct channel (in terms of the 2norm of the channel matrices). For our proposed algorithm, we place a restriction that the users can only choose their\nassociation among the three strongest pico BSs. We initiate our algorithm by assigning the users to their respective\nstrongest pico BSs. Fig. 1 compares the performance of the algorithms when the proportional fairness utility is\nused, i.e., fn (Rn ) = log(Rn ), \u2200 n \u2208 N . Each point on this figure is averaged over 100 randomly generated user\npositions and channel coefficients. The left panel of Fig. 1 compares the users' averaged rates achieved by different\n\n\f17\n\nalgorithms. The right panel of Fig. 1 compares the CDF (cumulative distribution function) of the individual rates of\nthe two algorithms when SNR = 30dB. Fig. 1 shows that if the user-BS assignment is allowed to be optimized, the\nproposed algorithm can achieve a substantially higher spectrum efficiency and fairer rate allocation, as compared to\nthe case when the user-BS assignment is fixed. This is reasonable since assigning weak users to less congested BSs\n(rather than the closest BSs) effectively reduces the interference level (hence the congestion level) of the congested\nBS. In this way, both user fairness and the spectral efficiency of the entire network are enhanced.\n20\n\n18\n\n1\nProposed Algorithm\nWMMSE Algorithm\n\nT =4, R =4\nq\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\nT =2, R =2\nn\n\n1\n\n0.7\nT =4, R =4\nn\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n14\nCDF\n\nAveraged User Rates\n\n0.8\n16\n\nTq=2, R1=2\n12\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n10\n\nProposed Algorithm\n0.2\n8\n\nWMMSE Algorithm\n\n0.1\n6\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n10\nSNR(dB)\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nIndividual Rate\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFig. 2. Comparison of the performance of the proposed algorithm and the WMMSE algorithm in a HetNet with different BS capabilities.\nThe proportional fair utility is used. N = 16, Q = 7. Half of the users are uniformly distributed in cell 1, all other users are uniformly\ndistributed in other cells. Three neighboring BSs have 10 receiving antennas, and all other BSs have the same number of antennas as BS 1\n(which is either 2 or 4). Left: comparison of the users' averaged rates. Right: comparison of the CDF of users' achieved rates.\n\nTo highlight the load balancing capability of the proposed algorithm, we next consider a scenario in a HetNet\nwhere the pico BSs have different capabilities. Specifically, three out of the six neighboring pico BSs of BS 1\nhave 10 receive antennas, and all other pico BSs (including BS 1) have fewer receive antennas. Half of the users\nare uniformly located in cell 1 (which is within d1,n \u2208 [20, 100] meters) and the rest of the users are uniformly\nlocated in other cells (dq,n \u2208 [20, 100] meters, q 6= 1). Again we use the proportional fairness utility function, and\nthe proposed algorithm compares favorably with the WMMSE algorithm. See Fig. 2.\nInterestingly, by using the proposed joint BS association and linear precoder optimization algorithm, the \"cell\nbreathing\" phenomenon [20] can be observed. This phenomenon refers to the desirable load balancing property of\na network: when a cell is congested, it contracts and the cell edge users automatically switch to adjacent cells. See\nFig. 3 for an illustration.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we consider the joint design of the user-BS assignment and the users' linear precoder in a\nmulticell heterogeneous network. By a careful user-BS association, users in a hot spot can avoid congesting the\nnearest BS or causing excessive interference to each other. Unfortunately the overall joint optimization problem is\nshown to be computationally intractable. To find a high quality locally optimal solution, we propose an efficient\nand low-complexity algorithm using a game theoretic formulation.

Left: user-BS assignment in which users are associated\nto the BS with the strongest channel magnitude in terms of 2-norm. Right: user-BS assignment generated by the proposed algorithm.\n\nis demonstrated via numerical simulations which show substantially improved spectrum efficiency and fairness\nprovisioning. A drawback of this algorithm is the fact that it requires the exact knowledge of channel state\ninformation (CSI). An important issue worth investigating is to what extent we can use inexact channel state\ninformation or just use the long-term channel statistics in place of the CSI. Another interesting issue is to incorporate\nthe users' quality of service constraints in the problem formulation.\nA PPENDIX A\nP ROOF\n\nOF\n\nT HEOREM 1\n\nProof: Given M disjunctive clauses C1 , * * * , CM defined on N Boolean variables X1 * * * , XN , i.e., Cm = t1 \u2228\nt2 \u2228t3 with ti \u2208 {X1 , * * * , XN , X\u03041 , * * * , X\u0304N }, the 3-SAT problem is to check whether there exists a truth assignment\n\nfor the Boolean variables such that all clauses are satisfied (i.e., each clause evaluates to 1) simultaneously. Let\n\u03c0(Cm , i) denote the ith term of the clause Cm , and let I(t) denote the index of a term t's corresponding variable.\n\nFor example if Cm = X\u03041 \u2228 X\u03042 \u2228 X4 , then \u03c0(Cm , 1) = X\u03041 , and I(\u03c0(Cm , 3)) = 4.\nGiven any 3-SAT problem with M disjunctive clauses and N variables, we construct an instance of multiple BS\nmulti-user uplink network with 3M + N BSs and M + 2N users. Let Tn = Rq = 1, \u03c3q2 = 1, p\u0304n = 1 and wn = 1,\nfor all q, n. Let hq,n denote the channel coefficient between user n and BS q . For each clause Cm , we construct 3\nclause BSs {c1m , c2m , c3m }, and construct 1 clause user denoted as user Cm . For each variable Xn , we construct 1\nvariable BS denoted as xn , and construct 2 variable users denoted as X\u0304n , Xn . The channel coefficients are specified\nas follows. The clause user Cm has nonzero channels only to the clause BSs {cim }3i=1 . The variable user Xn has\n\ni that satisfies X\u0304 = \u03c0(C , i). Similarly, the user\nnonzero channels only to the variable BS xn and the clause BS Cm\nn\nm\ni that satisfies X = \u03c0(C , i).

Otherwise, assign user X\u0304n to BS xn . 2) for each clause Cm , pick\nan index i\u2217m \u2208 {1, 2, 3} such that \u03c0(Cm , i\u2217m ) = 1 (note that because the 3-SAT problem is satisfied, we can always\ni\u2217\n\ndo so). Assign the clause user Cm to the clause BS cmm . We claim that by the above user-BS assignment, and\nby letting all the assigned users transmit with full power, the overall sum rate achieved is 3(M + N ). To argue\nthis claim, we first note that there is a single user in the variable user pair X\u0304n , Xn that transmits with full power\nto BS xn . Thus each variable BS xn is free of multiuser interference and obtains a rate of log(1 + 71 ) = 3. We\nthen consider an arbitrary clause Cm , and pick a term t that evaluates to 1, i.e., t = \u03c0(Cm , i\u2217m ). According to our\nassignment scheme, user t\u0304 does not transmit while user t transmits with full power. By our construction of the\ni\u2217\n\nchannel in (36)\u2013(38), the only variable user that has nonzero channel to the clause BS cmm is user t\u0304. Since user\ni\u2217\n\nt\u0304 does not transmit, then the clause user Cm can transmit to clause BS cmm free of interference. Consequently it\n\nobtains a rate of log(1 + 71 ) = 3. In summary, each variable BS is able to achieve a rate of 3, while each set of\nthree clause BSs {c1m , c2m , c3m } obtains a total rate of 3. Thus the total system sum rate is 3(M + N ).\nConversely, suppose the network achieves a total rate of 3(M + N ), we argue that the corresponding 3-SAT\nproblem must be satisfied. We show this direction by three steps.\n\n\f20\n\nStep 1) We first claim that for any variable BS xn , its maximum achievable sum rate is obtained when a single\nvariable user, Xn or X\u0304n , transmits to it using full power, while the remaining user does not transmit. Let pXn and\npX\u0304n denote the transmission power of user Xn and X\u0304n , respectively. The rate region of this uplink channel when\n\nthe interference is treated as noise can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nR = {(RX\u0304n (pXn , pX\u0304n ), RXn (pXn , pX\u0304n )) : 0 \u2264 pXn \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 pX\u0304n \u2264 1}\n\u0012\n\u0013\npXn |hxn ,Xn |2\nRXn (pXn , pX\u0304n ) = log 1 +\n1 + pX\u0304n |hxn ,X\u0304n |2\n!\npX\u0304n |hxn ,X\u0304n |2\nRX\u0304n (pXn , pX\u0304n ) = log 1 +\n1 + pXn |hxn ,Xn |2\n\nwith the channel coefficients given as hxn ,X\u0304n = hxn ,Xn =\n\n\u221a\n\n(39)\n\n7. In [38], Charafeddine and Paulraj derived a complete\n\ncharacterization of this rate region (without time-sharing operation). This region (plotted in Fig. 5) asserts that the\nsum rate maximum point can be achieved only if a single user transmits using its full power (at point A or B).\nStep 2) We then argue that a variable user should never be assigned to any clause BS at the sum-rate optimal\nsolution. To see this, consider an arbitrary Cm and an arbitrary i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, let t = \u03c0(Cm , i). Suppose at the\n\noptimal solution user t transmits to BS cim , then it can obtain a maximum rate of log(1 + 11 ) = 1. If BS xI(t) has\nno associated user at the optimal solution, then the same user t can switch to BS xI(t) and obtain a rate increase\n\nof log(1 + 71 ) \u2212 log(1 + 1) = 2. This is a contradiction to the optimality of the solution. Consequently BS xI(t)\n\nmust have user t\u0304 associated to it. In this case, the maximum sum rate that user t and t\u0304 can obtain is the optimal\nsolution for the following problem\nmax\n\n0\u2264pt ,pt\u0304 \u22641\n\n\u0012\nlog 1 +\n\n7pt\u0304\n1 + 7pt\n\n\u0013\n\n+ log (1 + pt ) .\n\nClearly at the optimal pt\u0304 = 1, and the tuple (pt , pt\u0304 ) = (0, 1) is a feasible solution to the above problem with\nan objective value log(1 + 71 ) = 3. We then argue that (pt , pt\u0304 ) = (0, 1) is in fact the optimal solution to this\noptimization problem. Specifically, we will show that the following is true\n\u0012\n\u0013\n7\nlog 1 +\n+ log (1 + pt ) < log(1 + 7), \u2200 0 < pt \u2264 1.\n1 + 7pt\nEquivalent we show the following inequality\n\u0012\nf (pt ) , 1 +\nNote that\n\ndf (pt )\ndpt\n\n7\n1 + 7pt\n\n42\n= 1 \u2212 (1+7p\n2 .

Combining\n\n< 8, we have that f (pt ) < 8 for all 0 < pxn \u2264 1. In summary, a\n\nvariable user never transmits to any clause BS at the sum rate optimal solution.\nStep 3) The third step is to show that any clause BS tuple {c1m , c2m , c3m } can at most obtain a rate of log(1+ 71 ) = 3\n\n\f21\n\nat the sum rate optimal point. This step is trivial as the only candidate that can select and transmit to clause BSs\n{cim }3i=1 is the clause user Cm . When there is no interference, the maximum rate user Cm (and equivalently the\n\nset of BSs {cim }3i=1 ) can get is log(1 + 7) = 3. Note that this maximum rate can be achieved only when at least\none of these clause BSs does not experience interference from the variable users.\nStep 2-3 together imply that each variable BS and each clause BS tuple {cim }3i=1 are able to achieve a rate\nat most 3 at sum rate optimal point. As a result, in order to achieve a system rate of 3(M + N ), each of them\nmust achieve a rate that exactly equals to 3. From Step 3, for any clause Cm , if a BS tuple {cim }3i=1 achieves a\n\nthroughput of 3, then it is only possible that there exists a index i\u2217m and a user t\u2217m = C(m, i\u2217m ) such that user t \u0304\u2217 m\n\ndoes not transmit. Set the terms t\u2217m = 1 for each clause m = 1, * * * , M . This assignment ensures that every clause\nCm contains at least one term that is assigned to 1. Consequently, the 3-SAT problem is satisfied.\n\nSince the above construction only involves universal constants, the joint linear precoder design and base station\nselection problem (SYS) is strongly NP-hard.
