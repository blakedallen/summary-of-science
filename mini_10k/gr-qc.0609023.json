There are at least 70,000\nTrans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) with diameters larger than 100 km in the\n30-50 AU region. Observations show that TNOs are mostly confined within\na thick band around the ecliptic, leading to the realization that they occupy\na ring or belt surrounding the Sun. This ring is generally referred to as the\nKuiper2 Belt (Edgeworth 1943; Kuiper 1951; Fernandez 1980).\nReasons of interest in the Kuiper Belt are as follows\n1\n\nSee http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb.html\nSee http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/gerard.html for the origin of the\nname.\n2\n\n1\n\n\f\u2022 It is likely that the Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are extremely primitive remnants from the early accretional phases of the solar system.\nThe inner, dense parts of the pre-planetary disk condensed into the major planets, probably within a few millions to tens of millions of years.\nThe outer parts were less dense, and accretion progressed slowly. Evidently, many small objects were formed\n\u2022 It is widely believed that the Kuiper Belt is the source of the shortperiod comets. It acts as a reservoir for these bodies in the same way\nthat the Oort Cloud acts as a reservoir for the long-period comets\n\u2022 KBOs are usually not yet modelled in the data reduction softwares\nused for orbit determination purposes, so that they may represent a\nserious bias in precise tests of Einsteinian and post-Einsteinian gravity.\nThus, it is important to assess their impact on planetary motions\nKBOs can be classified into three dynamical classes (Jewitt et al. 1998)\n\u2022 Classical KBOs (CKBOs), following nearly circular orbits with relatively low eccentricities (e < 0.25) and semimajor axes 41 AU . a .\n46 AU; they constitute about 70% of the observed population\n\u2022 Resonant KBOs occupy mean motion resonances with Neptune, such\nas 3:2 (the Plutinos, a \u223c 39.4 AU) and 2:1 (a \u223c 47.8 AU), and amount\nto about 20% of the known objects\n\u2022 Scattered KBOs, which represent only about 10% of the known KBOs\nbut have the most extreme orbits, with a \u223c 90 AU and e \u223c 0.6,\npresumably due to a weak interaction with Neptune; we only have\nrather poor knowledge of them.\nIn this paper we determine the mass of KBOs in a truly dynamical way by\nmeans of the latest observational determinations of the secular perihelion\nadvances of the inner planets of the Solar System. The use of such celestial bodies presents many advantages. Long data sets including also many\naccurate radio-technical range and range-rate measurements are available;\nthey cover many orbital revolutions, contrary to the outer planets which are\nmore affected by KBOs like Uranus and Neptune. Indeed, mainly optical\ndata and sparse radar-ranging measurements exist for them covering barely\none period for Uranus and less than one full orbital revolution for Neptune.\nMoreover, for heliocentric distances of the order of just 1 AU or less many\ndetails of the true mass distribution of KBOs are not relevant and all the recently proposed analytical models converge satisfactorily to a substantially\n2\n\n\fTable 1: Observationally determined extra-precessions of the longitudes of\nperihelia of the inner planets, in arcseconds per century (\u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 ), by using\nEPM2004 with \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 1, J2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 , from Table 3 of (Pitjeva 2005b).\nBoth KBOs and the general relativistic gravitomagnetic force were not included in the adopted dynamical force models. The quoted uncertainties are\nnot the mere formal, statistical errors but are realistic in the sense that they\nwere obtained from comparison of many different solutions with different\nsets of parameters and observations. The correlations among such determined planetary perihelia rates are very low with a maximum of about 20%\nbetween Mercury and the Earth (Pitjeva, private communication 2005).\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\n\u22120.0036 \u00b1 0.0050 0.53 \u00b1 0.30 \u22120.0002 \u00b1 0.0004 0.0001 \u00b1 0.0005\nunified description, given the present-day accuracy in reconstructing the orbital motions in our region of the Solar System. This fact greatly simplifies\nthe analytical calculation and allows for reliable, rather model-independent\ndeterminations of the KBOs's mass.\n\n2\n\nThe determined extra-rates of perihelion\n\nThe Russian astronomer E.V. Pitjeva (Institute of Applied Astronomy, Russian Academy of Sciences) recently processed almost one century of data\nof all types in the effort of continuously improving the EPM2004 planetary ephemerides (Pitjeva 2005a). Among other things, she also determined\nresidual secular, i.e. averaged over one orbital revolution, rates of the longitudes of perihelion \u031f = \u03a9+\u03c9, where \u03c9 and \u03a9 are the argument of perihelion\nand the longitude of the ascending node, respectively, of the inner planets\n(Pitjeva 2005b) as fit-for parameters of global solutions in which she contrasted, in a least-square way, the observations (ranges, range-rates, angles\nlike right ascension \u03b1 and declination \u03b4, etc.) to their predicted values computed with a complete suite of dynamical force models. The results are\nshown in Table 1. The modelled forces are\n\u2022 The Newtonian N-body perturbations including also the effect of 301\nlargest asteroids (Krasinsky et al. 2002) and of the minor asteroid ring\nin the ecliptic\n\u2022 The Sun's quadrupole mass moment J2 (Patern\u00f2 et al. 1996; Pijpers\n1998; Mecheri et al. 2004), set to 2 \u00d7 10\u22127\n3\n\n\f\u2022 The post-Newtonian gravitoelectric forces (Newhall et al. 1983) parameterized in terms of the PPN Eddington-Robertson-Schiff parameters \u03b3 and \u03b2 (Will 1993) set to their general relativistic values \u03b3 =\n\u03b2=1\nThe un-modelled forces are\n\u2022 The Newtonian force induced by KBOs\n\u2022 The post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic force responsible for the LenseThirring effect (Lense and Thirring 1918).\nThus, the effect of KBOs is entirely accounted for by the so-obtained residual\nperihelia advances of Table 1.\n\n3\n\nModelling and confrontation with data\n\nIn order to make a comparison with Table 1, a theoretical prediction for the\nsecular precessions induced by KBOs on the planetary perihelia is required.\nThe action of KBOs can be treated in a perturbative way. The Gauss\nrate equations for \u03c9 and \u03a9 are, for a generic orbital configuration\n\u221a\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\nd\u03a9\n1 \u2212 e2\nd\u03c9\nr\n= \u2212 cos i\n+\n\u2212Ar cos f + At 1 +\nsin f ,\n(1)\ndt\ndt\nnae\np\nand\n\n\u0010r\u0011\nd\u03a9\nA\n\u221a n\nsin(\u03c9 + f ),\n=\ndt\nna 1 \u2212 e2 sin i a\n\n(2)\n\np\nwhere i is the the inclination of the orbit, p = a(1\u2212 e2 ), n = GM/a3 is the\nKeplerian mean motion, f is the true anomaly counted from the pericentre,\nand Ar , At and An are the radial, transverse and normal components of the\nperturbing acceleration A, respectively.\nFor almost ecliptic orbits (i \u223c 0 deg, cos i \u223c 1, sin i \u223c i), like those\nof the Solar System's major bodies, the rate equation for \u031f can safely be\napproximated as\n\u221a\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\nd\u031f\n1 \u2212 e2\nr\n\u223c\n\u2212Ar cos f + At 1 +\nsin f .\n(3)\ndt\nnae\np\nIts secular rate is obtained by evaluating the right-hand-side of eq.

At heliocentric\ndistances . 1 AU many details of the three-dimensional mass distribution of\nKBOs can be neglected, so that we can approximate it with a bi-dimensional\ndistribution lying in the ecliptic plane. Moreover, the four models analyzed\nby Bertolami and Vieira (2006), i.e. two-rings, uniform disk, non-uniform\ndisk and torus, give the same results for r \u226a 20 AU and for various ecliptic\nlatitudes \u03b2 close to zero. Thus, we will adopt for CKBOs the uniform disk\nmodel, which consists of a uniform, hollow thin disk lying in the ecliptic\nplane within distances Rmin = 37.8 AU and Rmax = 46.2 AU (Bernstein et\nal. 2004).\nThe Newtonian gravitational field of a thin massive ring exhibits cylindrical symmetry and has an in-plane, radial component and an out-of-plane,\nnormal component (Owen 2003). Since we are looking for the effects induced\non the longitude of the perihelion, only the radial component is relevant to\nus. Thus, from eq. (3)\u2212eq.

(11) can now be used to determine mK in a truly\ndynamically, model-independent way. To this aim, let us note that, by\nconstruction, the determined extra-rates of Table 1 are not only due to\nKBOs, but also the Lense-Thirring field and the mismodelled part of the\nsolar J2 , which is presently uncertain at a \u223c 10% level, contribute to them.\nTheir nominal magnitudes are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.\nAlthough the Lense-Thirring effect and the mismodelled part of the J2\nprecessions may be neglected in our analysis, being smaller than the errors of\nTable 1, we prefer conservatively to cancel out, by construction, any possible\nimpact due to them. It can be done by suitably combining the perihelia of\nMercury, the Earth and Mars according to an approach followed, e.g., in\n3\n\nRecall that cos \u03b2 =\n\np\n1 \u2212 sin2 i sin2 f .\n\n6\n\n\fTable 3: Nominal values of the classical secular precessions of the longitudes\nof perihelion \u031f of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, in \u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 , induced by\nthe solar quadrupolar mass moment J2 .

(9) for both the models used: indeed, by using our values for mK it\nis possible to show that additional terms in the expansion of eq. (9) yield\nprecessions far too small to be detected with the present-day accuracy.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we dynamically determined the mass of KBOs from an analysis\nof the recently determined secular perihelion advances of the rocky planets\nof the Solar System. We modelled CKBOs as a uniform thick ring; such a\nsimple model is justified by the fact that at heliocentric distances of about\n1 AU many details of the true three-dimensional KBOs mass distribution\ncan be neglected; indeed, many different, more or less complicated analytical\nmodels manifest substantially the same behavior at distances much less than\n20 AU. For CKBOs we obtained a mass of 0.033\u00b10.115, in units of terrestrial\nmasses. A two-rings model for the Resonant KBOs yields a mass of 0.018 \u00b1\n0.063.\nSuch figures are consistent with those by\n\u2022 Bernstein et al. (2004), who give a nominal mass of 0.010 for CKBOs\nand 0.021 for their Excited class including some Plutinos and Scattered\nKBOs. They used the ACS camera of the Hubble Space Telescope\n\u2022 Gladman et al. (2001) yielding a mass of 0.04 \u2212 0.1 for all the TNOs\nin the range 30-50 AU, excluding the Scattered KBOs. The adopted\ntechnique was deep imaging on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nand the ESO Very Large Telescope UT1\n\u2022 Trujillo et al. (2001) giving for CKBOs a value of 0.030, from a\nwide-field survey with the CCD Mosaic camera of the Canada-FranceHawaii Telescope.\nThe upper limit of 0.3 terrestrial masses obtained by Backman et al. (1995)\nfrom far-IR emission measurements is, instead, ruled out.\nIt is important to note that all the previous estimates are based on\nvarious assumptions about, e.g., albedo and density of the KBOs for which\n\n8\n\n\fTable 4: Nominal values of the classical secular precessions of the longitudes\nof perihelion \u031f of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, in \u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 , induced by\nCKBOs. For mK the value of eq. (12) has been used.\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\n0.00002 \u00b1 0.0001 0.00006 \u00b1 0.0003 0.0001 \u00b1 0.0004 0.0002 \u00b1 0.0008\nvery large uncertainties still exist, so that the authors of the previously cited\nworks decided to release no errors of their mass estimations.\nThe impact of KBOs on the inner planets of the Solar System lies at\nthe edge of the present-day accuracy. Its induced effects, shown in Table 4\nfor a particular value of the CKBOs' mass, should not be neglected in, e.g.,\nprecision tests of gravity because, especially for the Earth and Mars, they are\nof the same order of magnitude, or even larger, than some Einsteinian (see\nTable 2) and post-Einsteinian features of motion4 which recently attracted\nmuch attention in view of a possible detection in the near future. If not\naccounted for in the dynamical force models of the orbit data reduction\nsoftwares, KBOs may bias the recovery of such effects when the required\nprecision level will be finally attained. In the case of the measurement of the\nLense-Thirring effect by only using the perihelion of Mercury (Iorio 2005a),\nthe impact of KBOs is negligible. It is not so if a combination of the perihelia\nof Mercury and the Earth is used in order to cancel out the mismodelling\nof J2 (Iorio 2005a). Thanks to the availability of a simple and reliable\nformula as that of eq. (11) for the inner planets, such a problem could be\ncircumvented by setting a suitable three-elements combination allowing for\nde-coupling the Lense-Thirring effect from J2 and KBOs as well.\nIncidentally, let us note that our results further enforce the conclusion\nthat the Pioneer anomaly cannot be due to KBOs (Anderson et al. 2002;\nNieto 2005; Bertolami and Vieira 2006).\n\nReferences\n[1] Anderson, J.D., Laing, P.A., Lau, E.L., Liu, A.S., Nieto, M.M., and\nTuryshev, S.G., Study of the anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10\nand 11, Phys.
