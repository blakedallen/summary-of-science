Its\nexistence in metals and their associated plasmas has been predicted [1,2]. Unfortunately,\nnegative \u03b5'(k,\u03c9=0) has not been reported in these systems. The extremely large ratio between the\nconductivity, \u03c3(k,\u03c9=0), and the dielectric admittance, \u03c9\u03b5'(k,\u03c9=0), makes the measurement\npractically impossible [3]. However, artificial structures have been recently proposed to modify\nthe plasma parameters and lead to a negative \u03b5'(k,\u03c9) [3,4], albeit in the microwave region. One\nobstacle a system with a negative \u03b5'(k,\u03c9=0) must overcome is instability. It is thought that\ninstability can lead to phase separation, and thus, a destruction of the state. However, a state of\nnegative compressibility in 2D carrier gasses has recently been shown to survive such a phase\nseparation under rather broad conditions [5].\nA giant electric-field-induced yield-stress has also been reported [6,7] in an\nelectrorheological (ER) fluid composed of a colloidal suspension of urea-coated nano-particles\nof Ba0.8Rb0.4TiO(C2O4)2 (U-BRTOCO) in silicone oil, suggesting an unusual field effect on the\n\u03b5' of nano-structure materials. We have therefore searched for such an effect on the \u03b5'(\u03c9) of the\nU-BRTOCO nano-particle aggregates.\nThe complex dielectric constant \u03b5(\u03c9)k\u22600 of the U-BRTOCO nano-particle ER fluid samples\n[6] was measured at room temperature under a dc bias field (Eb) between two plate-electrodes.\n\u03b5(\u03c9) \u2261 \u03b5'(\u03c9) \u2212 i\u03b5\"(\u03c9) = \u03b5'(\u03c9) \u2212 i[\u03c3(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c3(0)]/\u03c9 = \u2212 iIacd/(\u03c9VacS), in the Heaviside-Lorentz units,\nis determined by measuring the ac current Iac through and the ac voltage Vac across the\nelectrodes, with d and S being the distance between the electrodes and the area of the electrode-\n\n\f3\n\nplates. The values are, respectively, Vac = 0.5 \u2013 10 V, \u03c9 = 10-4 \u2013 105 Hz, Eb = 0 - 5.0 kV*mm-1, d\n= 0.1 - 0.2 mm and S = 1cm2. The corresponding wave-vector \u23a2k\u23a2, therefore, is around 100-102\ncm-1 if the fluid is treated as a homogeneous medium [1], but might be as large as 105 cm-1 when\nthe nanostructures are considered.\n\n[Insert Figure 1 about here]\nTypical \u03b5'(\u03c9) results of an ER sample at different Eb's are displayed in a \u03b5'-\u03c9 plot (Fig.\n1a). At Eb = 0, a large dispersion is observed to fall into two frequency regions (inset, Fig.1a). A\nDebye-like relaxation appears around 5\u00d7103 Hz with the \u03b5' decreasing from ~ 30 to ~ 10\nbetween 102 and 105 Hz. It should be noted that the surface conductance of individual particles\nhas been invoked to account for the similar features previously reported [8]. Below 1 Hz,\nhowever, both \u03b5' and \u03b5\" increase as \u03c9 decreases, with \u03b5' rapidly reaching a value of 20,000 at ~\n10-4 Hz. They roughly obey the fractional power law of \u03c9\u2212n with n \u2248 0.5, and the \u03b5'/\u03b5\"-ratio is\nindependent of \u03c9, as prescribed by the empirical 'universal dielectric response' (UDR) for a\ndisordered solid, which can be modelled as a capacitor-resistor network [9,10]. Therefore, in the\nabsence of an Eb, our samples behave similarly to other disordered systems at low \u03c9.\n\n[Insert Figure 2 about here]\nHowever, in the presence of an Eb \u2265 0.15 kV*mm-1, the situation changes drastically: \u03b5'\ndecreases from its unbiased value and switches sign below ~ 1 Hz but with a negligible Ebdependence at higher frequencies. As shown in Fig.1a, the positive \u03b5' drops precipitously to a\nnegative value at a characteristic frequency \u03c9c, which increases with Eb. For example, \u03b5' at\n\u03c9~10-3 Hz decreases from +103 to \u2013104, when Eb is increased from 0 to 0.5 kV*mm-1. The \u03c9c\nincreases from ~3\u00d710-3 to 3\u00d710-1 Hz as Eb rises from 0.5 to 3.5 kV*mm-1. However, both \u03b5'(\u03c9)\nand \u03c9c change little for Eb > 3.5 kV*mm-1. A complete set of the \u03b5'(\u03c9)-data is shown in Fig. 2. A\nlarge low frequency dispersion in \u03b5\"(\u03c9) = [\u03c3(\u03c9)- \u03c3(0)]/\u03c9 is also observed. \u03c3(\u03c9) increases with Eb\n\n\f4\n\nand becomes \u03c9-independent below a characteristic frequency \u03c9\u03c3 > \u03c9c, although both increase\nwith Eb. When \u03c9 < \u03c9\u03c3, \u03c3(\u03c9) is Eb-independent (Fig. 1b). A slight dip in \u03c3(\u03c9) is detected near \u03c9c.\nWhile the \u03c3(\u03c9) can be understood in terms of the percolation paths associated with the fieldinduced closer particle-packing, a negative \u03b5'(\u03c9) is expected from neither the percolation nor the\nUDR model. Similar field effects on \u03b5'(\u03c9) and \u03b5\"(\u03c9) are also observed in the pellet samples of\nU-BRTOCO nano-particles (Fig.1a), demonstrating that the silicone oil is not essential in the\nmanifestation of negative \u03b5'.\n\nVery recently, similar field-induced negative \u03b5'(\u03c9) has been\n\ndetected [10] in another nano-particle colloid (but not with large particles) at 10-3 Hz, suggesting\nthat field-induced \u03b5' sign-change is length-scale-sensitive and less material-sensitive.\nWhile a field-induced negative \u03b5' at low \u03c9 has been reported previously in material\nsystems such as Schottky diodes [11] and fuel cells [12], it had been considered to be a local\nelectrochemical effect, thermal-induced de-trapping, or simply an experimental artefact. To\ndetermine \u03b5' at very low \u03c9, extra cautions have been taken. A technique-related artefact is not\nthe cause since we employed ten different circuits and all yielded the same results. Calibrations\nagainst resistors and capacitors show that both the systematic phase-shifts as well as the\nexperimental resolution of the phase-angle \u03b8(\u03c9)=tan-1(\u03c9\u03b5'/\u03c3) are better than 0.05\u00b0, which is\norders of magnitude smaller than our experimental values (inset, Fig.1b). The possibility of an\nelectrode-related artefact is unlikely since the same \u03b5'(Eb) results are obtained when different\nelectrodes of Cu, Ni, Pt, and Au are used. Opposite polarities of the applied Eb produce the same\nnegative \u03b5', effectively ruling out any local battery origin of the observation. In addition, the\nproposed electrochemical reactions and electrode effects should result in a large nonlinearity.\nTherefore, the non-linear effect was determined [10] by investigating the waveform of the outof-phase current, the third harmonic, and the Vac and Eb-dependences of \u03b5'. The non-linearity soobtained below \u03c9c is not more than a few percent for Vac up to 100 V at Eb > 2.5 kV*mm-1. No\nmagnetic field greater than 10-6 T has been detected in our samples with a negative \u03b5'~ \u2212105,\nruling out any inductive origin of the phenomenon. It is known that particles of similar charge\n\n\f5\n\nattract in a material with a negative \u03b5'(\u03c9), which will lead to instabilities, such as the formation\nof charge density waves. However, the observed noise spectrum follows the standard\n1/\u03c9\u2212dependence, and displays no anomaly at \u03c9c, indicating that no electronic instability is\ninvolved. The arrest of such instabilities may be the result of the Eb applied. All of the above\ndemonstrate that the field-induced negative \u03b5' is indeed an intrinsic property of the nano-particle\naggregates.\nIn a system exhibiting a resonance, a negative \u03b5'(\u03c9) occurs at frequencies slightly higher\nthan the resonant frequency \u03c9o. The nano-particles in our ER fluid sample are known [6] to form\ncolumns in the presence of Eb. A possible electric-field-driven mechanical resonance at \u03c9o in\nsuch column-structures is examined. However, the estimated \u03c9o = \u221a(k/m) ~ 105 Hz, where k and\nm are respectively the elastic modulus and the mass of the assembly, is much greater than the \u03c9c\n~10-1 Hz observed. This is further confirmed by the observation of a negative \u03b5'(\u03c9) with a low\u03c9c in the pellet sample, where mechanical oscillation, if it exists, is expected to occur at an even\nhigher frequency. On the other hand, the free plasma model [13], \u03b5'(\u03c9)=1\u2212\u03c9p2/(\u03b32+\u03c92), accounts\nfor the data well (Fig.1a), where \u03c9p is the plasma frequency and \u03b3 is the damping parameter. The\n\u03b3 deduced is rather small with a value ~ 10-4 s-1. The small \u03b3 implies that the carriers will keep\ntheir initial phase intact for hours without significant interference from particle collisions,\nthermal excitation, and electromagnetic noise. This suggests that new collective excitations may\nbe the origin of the negative \u03b5'(\u03c9). Unfortunately, the \u03c9p =\u221a(Ne2/m) ~ 10-1 Hz in the free plasma\nmodel so obtained, where N, e, and m are the density, charge, and mass of the carriers,\nrespectively, leads to a very low carrier density of 104 \u2013 106/cm3, whose physical meaning\nremains a puzzle. However, the impasse can be alleviated to a large extent by increasing the\neffective mass of the carriers. The observed \u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c3(0)+\u03c9\u03b5\"(\u03c9) includes the dc percolative\nconductance and thus prevents a direct comparison with the model.\n\n[Insert Figure 3 about here]\n\n\f6\n\nWe want to determine if a negative polarization P exists in the U-BRTOCO nano-particle\naggregates in the presence of a positive field. The I(V)-loops of the sample have therefore been\nmeasured over a V-range of \u00b1200 V (or field-range of \u00b12 kV*mm-1) at frequencies of 1 \u2013 10-4 Hz.\nAt 1 Hz, a singly connected clockwise loop centred on the origin is detected, as expected of an\nordinary capacitor. However, at lower \u03c9, two counter-clockwise loops appear at high \u239fV\u239f (inset,\nFig. 3), in addition to the clockwise one around the origin (too small to be resolved with the scale\nused in the inset of Fig. 3), suggesting the reversal of the I-sign at high |V|. To investigate the\ncharge Q accumulated across the sample, we have integrated the hysteretic component of I, i.e.\nQ(t) =\n\nt\n\n\u222b (I \u2212 I\n\nreversible\n\n)d\u03c4 , which is proportional to P and shown together with the V as a function of\n\n0\n\ntime. Q or P is found to be always negative under positive V, except for a narrow V-range within\n\u00b1 15 V. The negative \u03b5' and the opposite directions of the local field and the induced polarization\nin the U-BRCOTO nano-particle aggregates appear to be the expected properties of the missing\ndielectric analogue of a diamagnet, or 'diaelectricity'. However, it should be noted that the\n'diaelectricity' observed here is accompanied with considerable resistive loss. Other possible\n'diaelectric' properties are being sought.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe work in Houston is supported in part by US National Science Foundation Grant No. DMR9804325, the T. L. L.
