Received ; in original form\n\nABSTRACT\n\nUsing observational data from the literature, we show that the non-thermal radio\nluminosity (L) of supernova remnants (SNRs) is a strong function of the average gas\nsurface density (\u03a3g ) of the galaxy in which the remnants reside, from normal spirals to\ndense luminous starbursts. Our result supports the interpretation of the radio sources\nin M82 and Arp 220 as normal SNRs, and not \"radio\" supernovae. We combine a simple\ntheory for electron cooling in SNRs with their observed radio luminosities to estimate\nthe remnant magnetic field strength (BSNR ): the correlation between L and \u03a3g implies\nthat BSNR also increases with \u03a3g . We explore two interpretations of this correlation:\n2\n(1) BSNR is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification, with BSNR\n\u221d \u03a3g and\n(2) BSNR results from shock-compression of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM)\nmagnetic field (BISM ), with BISM being larger in denser galaxies. We find that shock\ncompression is, on average, sufficient to produce the observed radio emission from\nSNRs in the densest starburst galaxies; amplification of post-shock magnetic fields is\nnot required. By contrast, in normal spirals modest post-shock field amplification in\nsome remnants (a factor of \u223c few \u2212 10) is consistent with the data; we find tentative\n2\nevidence that both the Alfv\u00e9n speed within SNRs and the ratio of BSNR\n/8\u03c0 to the\npost-shock pressure (\"\u01ebB \") are constant in SNRs from galaxy to galaxy. We discuss\nobservational tests that can be used to more definitively distinguish between these two\ninterpretations of the radio luminosities of SNRs. Regardless of which is correct, the\nradio emission from SNRs provides an upper limit to BISM that is independent of the\nminimum energy assumption. For the densest starbursts, the magnetic energy density\nin the ISM is below the total ISM pressure required for hydrostatic equilibrium; thus\nmagnetic fields are not dynamically important on the largest scales in starbursts, in\ncontrast with spiral galaxies like our own. This dichotomy may have implications for\ngalactic dynamo theory.\nKey words: ISM: supernova remnants - galaxies: magnetic fields, starburst - radio\ncontinuum: galaxies\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe magnetic energy density of the Galaxy is in rough\nequipartition with both the cosmic ray and the turbulent\nenergy densities. These components of the ISM combine to\nproduce a midplane pressure sufficient to balance the selfgravity of the Galactic disk and thus to establish hydrostatic\nequilibrium (Boulares & Cox 1990). Moreover, direct probes\nof magnetic fields in dense star-forming regions within the\nGalaxy indicate that they may be dynamically important\nc\n\nRAS\n\n(Crutcher 1999). Because of the potential importance of\nmagnetic fields for star formation on small scales, at and\nbelow the scale of giant molecular clouds, and for the structure and self-regulation of galaxies on their largest scales,\nit is of considerable interest to understand how the average\nmagnetic field strength varies from normal galaxies to starbursts, where the ISM conditions are considerably different.\nA rough upper limit to the average magnetic field\nstrength in a galaxy can be constructed by assuming that\nthe field is dynamically comparable to gravity. For a thin\n\n\f2\n\nThompson, Quataert, & Murray\n\nself-gravitating gas-dominated disk of average gas surface\ndensity \u03a3g , this \"equipartition\" field strength is\n\u221a\nBeq \u2248 2\u03c0 2G \u03a3g \u2248 2.3 \u03a3g mG,\n(1)\nwhere \u03a3g is measured in g cm\u22122 . Beq provides an upper limit\nto B on galactic scales because for B > Beq the field is buoyant and escapes the host galaxy (Parker 1966). For galaxies\nlike the Milky Way, in which the total surface density, \u03a3tot ,\nis dominated by stars, Beq in equation (1) should be multiplied by a factor of (\u03a3tot /\u03a3g )1/2 (\u2248 3). The measured gas\nsurface densities of galaxies vary by more than 4 decades\n(e.g., Kennicutt 1998, hereafter K98). Over this range, equation (1) implies a maximum field strength of Beq \u2248 15 \u03bcG\nfor the Milky Way (\u03a3g \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 g cm\u22122 ; \u03a3tot /\u03a3g \u2248 10)\nand \u223c 20 mG in galaxies like Arp 220 that anchor the highdensity end of the Schmidt Law with \u03a3g \u2248 10 g cm\u22122 and\n\u03a3tot /\u03a3g \u2248 1 (Downes & Solomon 1998).\nEstimates of magnetic field strengths in galaxies are\ntraditionally limited to the \"minimum energy\" assumption\nof Burbidge (1956), which posits an equality between the\nmagnetic and cosmic ray energy densities (see Longair 1994;\nBeck & Krause 2005). This approximation works well in the\nGalaxy and other normal spirals where the field strength is\nalso nearly equipartition in the sense of equation (1), but\nthe minimum energy assumption likely underestimates the\nfield strengths in starburst galaxies because of strong cosmic\nray electron cooling (Condon et al. 1991; Chi & Wolfendale\n1993; Thompson et al. 2006; hereafter [T06]).\nOne way to see that the minimum energy estimate\nmust fail in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) like\nArp 220 is to note that the inverse Compton (IC) cooling\ntime for radio-emitting cosmic ray electrons is tIC \u223c 104 yr\n(e.g., Condon et al. 1991). The minimum energy estimate\nfor the magnetic field strength yields a synchrotron cooling\ntimescale at GHz frequencies that is \u223c 10 times longer, and\nyet Arp 220 lies on the FIR-radio correlation together with\nessentially all star-forming galaxies (Condon 1992; Yun et\nal. 2001), which have synchrotron cooling times somewhat\nshorter than IC cooling times (e.g., Fig. 2 of T06). These\nfacts imply that the true magnetic field strength in ULIRGs\nis considerably larger than the minimum energy estimate,\nand that rapid electron cooling invalidates the assumptions\nupon which that estimate is predicated.\nThis argument can be generalized and used to construct an empirically derived minimum magnetic field\nstrength in galaxies by equating the magnetic energy\ndensity UB and the energy density in starlight Uph . Because\nthe ratio UB /Uph determines the ratio of synchrotron to\nIC cooling, and because normal galaxies and ULIRGs lie\non both the FIR-radio correlation and the Schmidt Law,\nUB \u2261 B 2 /8\u03c0 must be larger than (or a constant fraction of)\nUph = F/c = \u01eb\u03a3\u0307SFR c, where \u01eb is a stellar IMF-dependent\nconstant, F is the flux, and \u03a3\u0307SFR is the star formation rate\nper unit area.1 Thus, the average magnetic field strength\nmust exceed\n\n1\n\nIn principle, a factor of the dust optical depth should be applied\nto Uph in the densest starburst galaxies, if the cosmic rays are cospatial with the dense molecular gas that is optically thick even in\nthe FIR (see, e.g., Thompson et al. 2005). However, this correction\nis uncertain and for the purposes of constructing a lower limit to\nB based on Uph , this expression suffices.\n\nBph = (8\u03c0\u01eb\u03a3\u0307SFR c)1/2\n\n\u2248\n\n\u2248\n\n0.3 \u03a30.7\nmG\ng\n1.0 \u03a30.85\nmG,\ng\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the numerical approximations follow from the observed Schmidt Laws of K98 (top) and Bouch\u00e9 et al. (2007)\n(bottom). Bph is a lower limit to the mean field strength\nin galaxies because if UB <\n\u223c Uph , variations in UB /Uph\nfrom galaxy to galaxy would likely introduce scatter and\nnon-linearity into the FIR-radio correlation (T06). For the\n>\nGalaxy, B >\n\u223c Bph \u2248 4 \u03bcG and for Arp 220, B \u223c Bph \u2248 1 mG.\nIn this paper, we argue that radio observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a complimentary probe\nof the ISM magnetic field strength in star-forming galaxies.\nIn \u00a72 we describe a simple synchrotron cooling model for\nthe radio luminosity of an individual SNR. The radio flux\ndepends critically on the magnetic field in the SNR, which\nis somewhat uncertain. At a minimum, a SNR must contain\nshock-compressed ISM magnetic field, which is constrained\n(on average) by the upper and lower limits of equations (1)\nand (2), respectively. However, the magnetic field in SNRs\ncould be much stronger than the shock compressed ISM field\nif there is significant amplification in the post-shock plasma.\nWe compare the remnant magnetic field strengths derived\nfrom the model presented in \u00a72 with our expectations from\nequations (1) and (2), to set limits on the importance of\nfield amplification in SNRs. We further argue that the radio\nemission from SNRs provides an upper limit on the ambient\nISM field in star-forming galaxies. In \u00a73 we show that the\nluminosity of SNRs is strongly correlated with the average\ngas surface density of the galaxy in which they reside. Using\nthe model of \u00a72, we invert these observations to constrain\nthe remnant and ambient ISM magnetic field in this sample\nof galaxies. We discuss our results in \u00a74, focusing on the relative importance of shock compression of ISM field versus\npost-shock field amplification.\n\n2\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS IN SUPERNOVA\nREMNANTS\n\nTo estimate the radio luminosity of a SNR, we assume that\na fraction 10\u22122 \u03be of the supernova kinetic energy (E51 =\nESN /1051 ergs) is supplied to primary cosmic ray electrons\nin the shock and that the accelerated electrons radiate synchrotron in a magnetic field of strength BmG = B/mG.\nWe further assume that the electron particle spectrum is\nflat, with a power-law index of p = 2 (n(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212p ), as is\nexpected theoretically for strong shocks (e.g., Blandford &\nEichler 1987) and is observed in situ in some SN remnants\n(e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005; Brogan et al. 2005). A value of\n\u03be \u2248 1 is required to explain the integrated radio flux from\nstar-forming galaxies, i.e., the FIR-radio correlation (V\u00f6lk\n1989; T06). Given the small scatter in the FIR-radio correlation (Yun et al. 2001), \u03be \u2248 1 is uncertain at the factor of\n< 2 level when averaged over many SNe in a galaxy. With\n\u223c\nthese assumptions, the radio luminosity is simply (van der\nLaan 1962)\n\u03bdL\u03bd \u2248\n\n\u03beESN\n1/2\n3/2\n\u2248 3\u00d71035 \u03be E51 \u03bdGHz BmG ergs s\u22121 , (3)\n2 ln[\u03b3max ] tsyn\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fRadio Emission from Supernova Remnants\n\u22123/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nwhere tsyn \u2248 3\u00d7104 BmG \u03bdGHz yr is the synchrotron cooling timescale for electrons radiating at \u03bdGHz = \u03bd/GHz and\nwhere we have assumed that tsyn >\n\u223c texp , where texp is the\nexpansion time of the remnant. In the last estimate in equation (3) we have assumed \u03b3max = 106 ; variations in \u03b3max\nfrom 104 \u2212 108 affect this estimate by only a factor of \u223c 1.5.\nEquation (3) is an estimate of the radio emission produced by the interaction between a SN and the ambient\nISM, i.e., the emission from a SNR (e.g., Shlovskii 1960).\nThe radio emission is expected to peak at the Sedov time\nand persist until the remnant cools radiatively (see the discussion of these timescales in \u00a74). This time evolution is in\ncontrast to radio supernovae which peak and decay after a\nmonth to few-years and which likely result from the interaction between a SN shock and the immediate circumstellar\nmedium and pre-SN ejecta (e.g., Chevalier 1982; Weiler et\nal. 2002). Nearly all of the radio remnants discovered in M82\nand Arp 220 that we discuss below do not vary appreciably on decade timescales (Kronberg et al. 2000; Rovilos et\nal. 2005). Rather than interpret these bright sources as bona\nfide radio SNe, we thus interpret them as normal SNRs.\nGiven an observed radio flux density, equation (3) can\nbe inverted to estimate the magnetic field strength in the\nSNR, BSNR . Assuming that BSNR is ambient ISM field compressed by the SN shock by a factor of f \u2248 3 (appropriate\nfor randomly-oriented fields; V\u00f6lk et al. 2002 advocate f \u2248 6\nfor young remnants), we obtain a simple estimate of the ISM\nmagnetic field strength in terms of the SNR flux density:\nBISM \u2248 3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n3\nf\n\nD\n10 Mpc\n\n\u00134/3\u0012\n\nS\u03bd\nmJy\n\n\u00132/3\n\n1/3\n\n\u03be \u22122/3\u03bdGHz mG,\n\n(4)\n\nequivalent to BISM f \u2248 BSNR . Equation (4) is most readily\ninterpreted as an upper limit on the ISM magnetic field given\na set of SNRs with flux density S\u03bd because (1) f may be\nas large as \u223c 7 and (2) turbulence and instabilities can in\nprinciple amplify the post-shock magnetic field. The SNR\nfield may thus be larger than \u223c f BISM , but it is unlikely to\nbe smaller.2\nThe assumptions made in deriving equation (4) include\nthat tsyn >\n\u223c texp (weak cooling) and that p = 2. Together,\nthese assumptions imply that the synchrotron spectral index\nshould be \u03b1 = (p \u2212 1)/2 = 1/2 (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ). For p 6= 2,\nand fixed total energy injected in cosmic ray electrons, the\nnormalization of equation (4) increases, but modestly: for\n5/9\np = 2.6, BISM is larger by a factor of \u2248 1.5 and BISM \u221d S\u03bd .\nThe spectral indices of GHz radio emission from SNRs range\nfrom \u03b1 \u2248 0.5 \u2212 1 (see the refs. in Table 1). Diversity in\n\u03b1 may signal diversity in p, evolutionary effects, that the\nassumption of weak cooling is violated, or some combination.\nAdditionally, note also that \u03be \u2248 1 is not valid during the\nearly free-expansion phase of SNR evolution.\nA further assumption made in deriving equation (4) is\nthat the supernova remnants are not radiative. If they were,\nf could be arbitrarily high. Indeed, Chevalier & Fransson\n(2001) argued that the radio point sources observed in M82\nand Arp 220 are radiative, but otherwise normal, supernova\nremnants (i.e., not \"radio\" SNe). As we show below and as\n\n2\n\nIf SNe systematically sample only low magnetic field regions of\na galaxy, BISM inferred from SNRs may not be the same as the\nvolume averaged magnetic field strength. This possibility cannot\nbe ruled out, but we regard it as unlikely.\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The time evolution of the post-shock magnetic field\nstrength, assuming B 2 /8\u03c0 = \u01ebB Psh , where Psh is the post-shock\nthermal pressure. A 1051 ergs supernova shock and \u01ebB = 0.1\nare assumed in all cases. With these assumptions, the post-shock\nmagnetic field is strongest during the free expansion phase, and\ndeclines during the Sedov-Taylor and snow-plow phases.\n\nwe discuss in more detail in \u00a74, the radio luminosities of\nthe remnants in starburst galaxies are consistent with compression of the ambient ISM magnetic field by an adiabatic\nshock, perhaps together with modest post-shock field amplification. Much larger f , as would be implied if the remnants\nwere radiative, is inconsistent with independent constraints\non the ambient ISM magnetic fields in these systems.\nTo provide some quantitative context for comparing the\nstrength of the magnetic field in SNRs produced by flux\nfreezing with that produced by possible amplification in the\npost-shock plasma, Figure 1 shows the post-shock magnetic\nfield strength in SNRs as a function of time assuming that\nthe post-shock remnant magnetic energy density is a factor \u01ebB times the post-shock pressure (as is often assumed in\nmodels of radio supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows;\ne.g., Reynolds & Chevalier 1981); we consider a range of ambient densities n, from low densities appropriate to SNRs\nin the Milky Way to high densities appropriate to SNRs in\nArp 220. For these calculations we have used the analytic approximations for the evolution of SNRs developed by Draine\n& Woods (1991), which include both the Sedov-Taylor and\npressure-driven snow-plow phases. The post-shock magnetic\nfield is the strongest during the free expansion phase and\ndecreases during the Sedov-Taylor phase and later as the\npost-shock plasma pressure decreases. We note, however,\nthat the appropriate value for \u01ebB is quite uncertain, and\nthus it is difficult to estimate from first principles the importance of post-shock field amplification (see Riquelme &\nSpitkovsky 2009 for a recent study).\n\n\f4\n\nThompson, Quataert, & Murray\n\nFigure 2.

For a\nsimilar figure, see Hunt & Reynolds (2006).\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nA large sample of radio SNRs is available in the literature.\nThese SNRs reside in a variety of galaxies that span the full\nrange of both the FIR-radio correlation and the Schmidt\nLaw. In general, the remnants are identified using the VLA,\nMERLIN, or VLBI, and are distinguished from compact HII\nregions by their steep non-thermal spectra (\u03b1 >\n\u223c 0.5). The\nfew \"radio SNe\" proper that appear in the compilations of\nSNe presented in the references in Table 1 are excluded.\nThese include remnant 41.95+57.5 in M82 from Kronberg et\nal. (1985) (see Kronberg et al. 2000) and SN 2000ft in NGC\n7469 (Colina et al. 2001; Alberdi et al. 2006). Background\nobjects such as AGN behind nearby galaxies like NGC 5194\nare a contaminant to the SNR sample (see Table 1).\nFigure 2 shows the luminosity of observed SNRs as a\n\nfunction of the average gas surface density \u03a3g of the galaxy\nin which they reside. For simplicity, all fluxes have been\nscaled to a frequency of 1.4 GHz assuming \u03b1 = 0.5, even in\nthose cases where \u03b1 is known empirically in some frequency\nrange. References, assumed distance, number of remnants,\nmaximum and average SNR luminosity, and the sensitivity, frequency, and resolution of the observations are given\nin Table 1. For all of the galaxies we consider, the remnants\naccount for just a few to ten percent of the total non-thermal\ncontinuum. Each vertical line in Figure 2 is a separate galaxy\n(or, for Arp 220, component). The filled square shows \u03bdL\u03bd\nfor the brightest single SNR. The line for each system extends to the lowest luminosity remnant identified.

Inferred ISM magnetic field strength as function of \u03a3g for the galaxies in Table 1 (from eq. 4 with f = 3), assuming that shock\ncompression of ambient ISM field determines the magnetic field strength in SNRs (BSNR ); alternatively, this plot can be interpreted as\nshowing BSNR /f . As in Figure 2, the filled square and horizontal bar show the maximum and average value of B from the brightest and\naverage SNR, for each system. The vertical bar extends to the lowest SNR luminosity observed. The thick solid line is the maximum\nmagnetic field estimate for a gas-dominated self-gravitating disk, Beq (eq. [1]). The dotted line includes the correction discussed after\neq. (1) for disks that are not gas-dominated (\u03a3tot /\u03a3g = 10). The dashed lines show the minimum required magnetic field strength for\nconsistency with the FIR-radio correlation (see eq. 2), assuming the average Schmidt Law from K98 (shallower index) and Bouch\u00e9 et\nal. (2007) (steeper index). An unweighted linear least-squares fit to BISM or BSNR , inferred from the average luminosity SNR (horizontal\nlines on each bar), gives B \u221d \u03a3g0.56 , whereas a fit to the brightest SNRs (highest inferred field strengths, filled squares) gives B \u221d \u03a30.52\ng\n(compare with Fig. 4).\n\nSNR distribution.

It is\nalso clear that the lowest SNR luminosities exhibit a corc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\nrelation with \u03a3g that is qualitatively similar to that of the\naverage and brightest SNRs.\nThe latter raises the concern that the results of Figure\n2 may represent a selection bias rather than a physical effect. The correlation between the maximum SNR luminosity\nand \u03a3g in Figure 2 is the most secure and is not subject to\nan obvious bias. In particular, although faint remnants in\nhigh-\u03a3g galaxies (which are rarer and thus tend to be more\ndistant) would be undetectable, bright remnants could be\nreadily seen in nearby low-\u03a3g systems, but are not. On the\nother hand, the correlations between the average and lowest\n\n\f6\n\nThompson, Quataert, & Murray\n\nremnant luminosity and \u03a3g are more subject to the obvious\nbias that faint remnants are difficult to detect in all galaxies.\nOne might anticipate that this bias would be particularly severe for higher \u03a3g galaxies and could account for the absence\nof low luminosity remnants in these systems. One indication\nthat this effect does not significantly affect our calculation\nof the average SNR luminosity is that nearly all of the detected remnants in M82, at a distance of 3.6 Mpc, are more\nluminous than even the brightest remnant in NGC 300 at\na distance of 1.9 Mpc (see Table 1). An additional piece of\ninformation comes from comparing the samples of Muxlow\net al. (1994) with Fenech et al. (2008) for the remnants in\nM82. The latter are three times more sensitive than the former, and yet, comparing the two datasets we see that the\naverage SNR luminosity decreases by just a factor of \u223c 1.5,\nfrom log 10 [\u03bdLmean\n] \u2248 35.1 to \u2248 34.9. A detailed comparison\n\u03bd\nof the luminosity function of detected SNRs in all galaxies\nin this sample would be useful both for exploring the density and magnetic field distribution of the ISM (\u00a74.3), and\nfor a more detailed understanding of the selection effects at\nlow remnant luminosity. Finally, we note that an additional\nreason that the lowest luminosity SNRs correlate with \u03a3g is\nthat detectable remnants must be brighter than the diffuse\nradio continuum of their host galaxy, which is larger in high\u03a3g galaxies as a result of the Schmidt Law (\u03a3\u0307SFR \u221d \u03a31.4\ng ;\nK98; \u03a3\u0307SFR \u221d \u03a31.7\ng ; Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007) and the FIR-radio\ncorrelation.\nFrom the observed luminosities in Figure 2, we can infer the SNR magnetic field BSNR under the assumptions of\nequations (3) and (4). To compare this magnetic field estimate with other constraints on the ISM magnetic field,\nwe plot these results in Figure 3 in terms of the ISM magnetic field strength BISM \u2261 BSNR /f , i.e., the ambient ISM\nfield strength that would produce a SNR field strength of\nBSNR by flux freezing. The correlation in Figure 2 combined\nwith equation (4) implies that BSNR and BISM are strong\nfunctions of \u03a3g . A simple linear least-squares fit to the data\npoints for the average SNRs (horizontal bars) gives\nlog10\n\n\u0014\n\nBISM BSNR /3\n,\nG\nG\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2248 \u22123.20 + 0.565 log10\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03a3g\n. (6)\ng cm2\n\nFor the brightest SNRs the relation is similar, but with\nnormalization \u22122.90 and slope 0.52. Note that for larger\nassumed p, the correlation between BISM and \u03a3g flattens\n(see the discussion after eq. 4). Figure 3 demonstrates that\nfor normal spirals the magnetic field strength BISM inferred\nfrom the average-brightness SNR is comparable to or larger\nthan the equipartition field, Beq (dotted line), and larger\nthan the minimum magnetic field strength Bph (dashed line;\neq. 2); this is true up to \u03a3g \u223c 0.1 g cm\u22122 , which characterizes starbursts such as NGC 253 and M82. For the densest,\nmost luminous starbursts in our sample (Arp 299 and the\nnuclei of Arp 220), BISM is below Beq and - at least for Arp\n220 - comparable to Bph . At the other extreme, for the lowest density systems in our sample, NGC 300 and NGC 4736,\nFigure 3 tentatively implies a trend of larger BISM /Beq at\nlow \u03a3g .\nBecause of the paucity of systems at very high \u03a3g in\nFigures 2 and 3, we searched the literature for additional\nhigh resolution radio observations of local starbursts and\nULIRGs. Unfortunately, the existing observations are not\nyet at sufficiently high spatial resolution to unambiguously\nimply that single SNRs have been detected. For example,\n\nMomjian et al. (2006) found 10 compact radio sources in\nthe ULIRG IRAS 17208-0014. Most have deconvolved sizes\nat half maximum of \u223c 10 pc. At a distance of \u2248 170 Mpc\n(z = 0.043), it is unclear if these compact sources are\nindeed individual SNRs, rather than unresolved populations of multiple remnants. In addition, the spectral indices\nof these sources are unknown, and many may be bright\nHII regions. A single source is unresolved, with a linear\nscale < 4.9 pc. This is also the least luminous source with\nS\u03bd (1.6 GHz) = 119 \u00b1 45 \u03bcJy. Given the gas surface density\nfrom K98 (\u2248 0.4 g cm\u22122 ), this individual source would lie\nabove the single Arp 299 remnant (see Table 1) in Figure 2\nby a factor of roughly two. Similarly, recent observations of\nIRAS 23365+3604 and IRAS 07251-0248 have been reported\nby Romero-Ca\u00f1izales et al. (2008). They reveal a number of\ncompact radio components. However, because these galaxies\nare at distances of \u2248 230 and \u2248 360 Mpc, respectively, the\nresolution of the observations is again insufficient to associate individual sources with single SNRs. Comparing with\nthe observations of the nuclear sources in Arp 220 by Lonsdale et al. (2006), we expect that the sources detected by\nRomero-Ca\u00f1izales et al. (2008) are likely to be collections of\n\u223c 10 SNRs per source. Higher resolution studies can confirm\nor exclude this possibility. Taking the sources from RomeroCa\u00f1izales et al. (2008) at face value, and estimating the gas\nsurface density of these ULIRGs from the literature, both\nsystems would lie significantly above the solid line (Beq ) in\nFigure 3, and they would deviate markedly from the trend\nseen in Figure 2.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFigure 2 demonstrates that SNR luminosities are a strong,\nand fairly continuous, function of \u03a3g , the average (galaxywide) gas surface density of their host galaxy. There may be\n\u22122\na change in the correlation for \u03a3g >\n\u223c 0.1 g cm , but more observations of SNRs in dense starbursts are required to assess\nthis. In the following, we consider two plausible interpretations of this data: (1) the luminosity of a SNR is significantly\nlarger in denser galaxies because the ambient magnetic field\nis significantly larger (as in Fig. 3), or (2) SNRs are brighter\nin denser galaxies because the magnetic field in the post2\nshock plasma scales as B 2 /8\u03c0 \u221d \u03c1ISM vsh\nand is thus larger\nin galaxies with a denser ISM (larger \u03c1ISM ).\n\n4.1\n\nField Amplification\n\nRecall that Bph (eq. 2, dashed lines in Fig. 3) is a lower limit\nto the true average ISM magnetic field strength because for\nB < Bph IC losses dominate synchrotron losses and one expects a systematic deviation from the FIR-radio correlation\nat high FIR luminosities, which is not observed (T06). In addition, the magnetic field inferred from SNRs, BISM (eq. 4,\npoints in Fig. 3) is an approximate upper limit to B because\npost-shock turbulence and instabilities can amplify magnetic\nfields in SNRs (V\u00f6lk et al. 2002; Berezhko et al. 2006). It\nis striking that the upper and lower limits on BISM coincide\nto within a factor of few for high \u03a3g starburst galaxies, particularly given the maximum equipartition magnetic fields\nthese galaxies could support (Beq , eq. 1). This correspondence implies that shock compression of BISM is sufficient\nto power SNR radio emission in dense starburst galaxies.\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fRadio Emission from Supernova Remnants\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

Note that if supernovae explode in regions of lower-than-average density (\u00a74.1,\n\u00a74.3), the inferred VA and \u01ebB both increase.\n\nFor the specific case of Arp 220, our inferred ISM magnetic field strength of \u223c 1 \u2212 3 mG is also reasonably consistent with the direct Zeeman detections of Robishaw et\nal. (2008); thus three independent observational methods,\neach likely probing somewhat different phases of the ISM,\nall imply that a magnetic field of a few mG pervades the\nnuclear region of Arp 220. A corollary of this is that Figure\n3 provides strong evidence for the interpretation of the radio\npoint sources in Arp 220 as normal SNRs expanding into a\nhighly-magnetized ISM; this alleviates the need for bona fide\nradio SNe to generate the very high luminosities observed\n(Smith et al. 1998; Rovilos et al. 2005; Parra et al. 2007; see\nalso Chevalier & Fransson 2001).\nIn contrast to starbursts like Arp 220, in normal spirals\nindependent observations constrain the ambient ISM magnetic field to be \u223c 5\u221210 \u03bcG (e.g., Beck 1982; Fitt & Alexander 1993; Beck & Krause 2005). Compressing this field by\na factor of \u223c 3 \u2212 7 results in a magnetic field of sufficient\nstrength to explain the typical radio SNR observed in normal spirals (Fig. 3); it appears, however, that the brightest\nremnants require fields that are a factor of few larger (and\nperhaps more at the lowest surface densities), either because\nthe SNe explode in a region of larger-than-average B or because of modest post-shock field amplification. Nonetheless,\nas in the case of starbursts, Figure 3 implies that significant\npost-shock magnetic field amplification (say > \u00d710) is not\nrequired to explain the average radio luminosities of SNRs\nin spiral galaxies.\nIn our own Galaxy, there is some evidence for magnetic\nfield amplification in young shell-type SNRs (e.g., V\u00f6lk et\nal. 2002; V\u00f6lk et al. 2005; Berezhko et al. 2006). In these\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\nmodels, individual Galactic SNRs are observed and modeled\nat a moment in their evolution, in contrast to the statistical approach taken here. For example, V\u00f6lk et al. (2005)\nconstrain BSNR \u223c 300 \u03bcG in Tycho's SNR by fitting the\nbroadband X-ray and radio emission simultaneously. Using\n\u03be = 1 in equation (4), and using only the radio data, we find\nthat B in the remnant is \u223c 9 \u03bcG.3 We have also compared\nthe results from V\u00f6lk et al. (2005) with our calculation for\nthe SNRs RCW 86, SN 1006, and Cass A. We find that\nBSNR = 3BISM \u2248 9, 4, and 180 \u03bcG, whereas V\u00f6lk et al.\nfind \u2248 100, 160, 500 \u03bcG, respectively. The difference in the\ninferred SNR field between V\u00f6lk et al. and this work lies\npartially in the assumptions about the energy in relativistic\nelectrons, encapsulated in our parameter \u03be in equations (3)\nand (4). In order to not over-produce the radio luminosity\nwith such a large B, V\u00f6lk et al. (2006) decrease the cosmicray electron-to-proton ratio, effectively using a small value\nof \u03be. In contrast, the normalization of the FIR-radio correlation, which we use here to normalize the emission from all\nindividual SNRs, requires that \u03be \u2243 1 when averaged over a\nsuitably large number of remnants. We expect that shock\naccelerated electrons will have a total energy equivalent to\n\u03be \u2243 1 by the onset of the Sedov-Taylor phase, when the\nshocked, swept-up mass is comparable to the ejecta mass. If\nshock acceleration only becomes efficient very late in a remnant's evolution - or if the electrons rapidly diffuse out of\nthe remnant on a timescale comparable to the Sedov-Taylor\ntime - then the assumption of \u03be \u2243 1 may be unreasonable\n3\n\nThis is for an adopted distance to the Tycho SNR of 2.4 kpc\n(from the Green catalog; see Table 1).\n\n\f8\n\nThompson, Quataert, & Murray\n\nfor a typical remnant. Although more definitive calculations\nare required to assess these possibilities, we regard both of\nthem as unlikely and thus conclude that the majority of observed remnants can be interpreted assuming \u03be \u2243 1. In this\ncase, although individual remnants, at particular moments\nin time, may have fields larger than that due to compression\nalone, Figure 3 suggests that this is not a significant effect\nfor SNRs in starbursts, or for the average SNR in most normal spirals.\nA SNR could in principle generate magnetic fields in approximate equipartition with the post-shock thermal pres2\n2\nsure of the gas: BSNR\n/8\u03c0 \u223c \u03c1ISM vsh\nwhere \u03c1ISM is the density of the ISM in which the SN explodes and vsh is the velocity of the SN shock at a given time (this assumption is often\nused in radio SNe and \u03b3-ray burst models; e.g., Chevalier\n1982; Meszaros & Rees 1997); see Figure 1 for estimates of\nthe magnetic field strengths in SNRs if significant post-shock\nfield amplification indeed occurs. In this interpretation, the\nhigher remnant luminosities in denser galaxies (Fig. 2) are\n1/2\ndue to the post-shock scaling BSNR \u221d \u03c1ISM , rather than\nanything about the magnetic field in the ambient ISM.\nAdopting the interpretation that post-shock magnetic\nfield amplification is solely responsible for generating BSNR\nand the observed radio emission, Figures 2 and 3 have several\ninteresting implications. Taking a constant gas scale height\nof h \u2248 100 pc for all galaxies, so that the average ISM density\nis \u03c1ISM = nISM mp = \u03a3g /(2h), Figure 3 implies that BSNR \u221d\n1/2\n\u03c1ISM , i.e., there is a constant characteristic Alfv\u00e9n speed in\nall observed remnants.4 The left panel of Figure 4 shows this\nexplicitly. Here, we have plotted VA = BSNR /(4\u03c04\u03c1ISM )1/2\nas a function of \u03a3g , assuming a constant gas scale height. A\nfit to the average SNRs gives\nlog10\n\nh\n\nVA\nkm s\u22121\n\ni\n\n\u2248 1.87 + 0.065 log10\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03a3g\n.\ng cm\u22122\n\n(7)\n\nFor the brightest remnants, the normalization is higher\n(\u2248 2.17) and the slope is flatter (\u2248 0.021). In Figure 4, VA\nis calculated assuming that the SNR density is 4\u03c1ISM , appropriate for a strong adiabatic (\u03b3 = 5/3) shock expanding\ninto the ISM. If, as we discuss in \u00a74.3, supernovae tend to\nsample low density regions of the ISM, the implied VA would\nincrease, probably by a factor of \u223c 3 \u2212 10. Despite uncertainty in the overall normalization for VA , the left panel of\nFigure 4 shows that the Alfv\u00e9n speed within remnants is\nroughly the same for all observed SNRs in all galaxies; if\nmagnetic field amplification is at work in SNRs, this finding\nis an important clue to the physics.\nThis result can equivalently be presented as a constraint\non \u01ebB , the ratio of the post-shock magnetic energy density\nto the post-shock pressure (see Fig. 1). The right panel of\nFigure 4 shows our determination of \u01ebB for the SNRs in our\nsample as a function of the average ISM gas density. For the\naverage SNRs, we find that\nlog10 [\u01ebB ] \u2248 \u22123.04 + 0.131 log 10\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03a3g\n.\ng cm\u22122\n\n(8)\n\nFor the brightest remnants, the normalization is consider4\n\nAlthough the assumption of constant gas scale height across\nall galaxies in the sample is a reasonable first approximation, they\nmay have systematically smaller h at higher \u03a3g , which would tend\nto flatten the function VA (nISM ) (see eq. 7).\n\nably higher (\u2248 \u22122.44) and the slope is yet flatter (\u2248 0.042).\nThe value of \u01ebB is proportional to VA2 , so the near-constancy\nof \u01ebB with nISM is not surprising given the results for VA in\nthe left panel of Figure 4. As with VA , we emphasize that\nthe precise value of \u01ebB depends sensitively on whether or\nnot supernovae explode in gas at the average ISM density.\nIf, as is more likely, most of the volume is filled with gas 10\nto 100 times less dense than nISM (\u00a74.3), the typical inferred\nvalue of \u01ebB would be \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.1.\nBecause the observations do not definitively favor either\nSN shock compression of ISM field or post-shock field amplification, we are unable to unambiguously determine which\nof these two possibilities is correct. An important testable\ndifference between these two hypotheses lies in the dependence of the radio emission on shock velocity or SNR diameter DSNR . For shock compression alone, \u03bdL\u03bd should be\n3/2\n2\nindependent of vsh while if B 2 /8\u03c0 \u221d \u03c1ISM vsh\n, \u03bdL\u03bd \u221d vsh .\nAnother way to state this result is that the two models\npredict different SNR surface brightness-to-diameter relations (the \u03a3SNR \u2212 DSNR relation). For shock compression\n\u221217/4\n\u22122\n2\nalone, \u03a3SNR \u221d DSNR\nwhile for B 2 \u221d vsh\n, \u03a3SNR \u221d DSNR\n(in both cases assuming p = 2; see also, e.g., Berezhko &\nV\u00f6lk 2004). Observations of SNRs in the Milky Way find\n\u22122.4\n\u03a3SNR \u221d DSNR\n(Case & Bhattacharya 1998), much closer to\nthe flux-freezing prediction, while observations of SNRs in\nM82 find \u03a3SNR \u221d D\u22123.5 (Huang et al. 1994), closer to the\npredictions of the field amplification model (see Urosev\u030ci\u0107 et\nal. 2005). For M82, the recent work by Fenech et al. (2008)\nfinds a best fit of \u03a3SNR \u221d D\u22123.0 . Updated observational\nsamples, particularly those that characterize SNRs in highdensity regions, and more sophisticated theoretical models are needed to fully understand the implications of the\n\u03a3SNR \u2212 DSNR relation and its connection to the correlation\npresented in Figure 2.\n4.2\n\nThe Dynamical Role of Magnetic Fields\n\nAnother important conclusion from Figure 3 is that BISM \u226a\nBeq in the most luminous starbursts. This implies that magnetic fields are not dynamically important for hydrostatic\nequilibrium on large scales in these systems, in sharp contrast with spiral galaxies like our own. One possible explanation for this difference is that the lifetime of intense starbursts (\u223c 107 \u2212 108 yrs) is significantly shorter than that\nof the relatively continuous star formation in normal spiral\ngalaxies; there may thus be less time for dynamo processes\nto amplify the average ISM magnetic field.\nFigure 3 also suggests that the magnetic energy density UB is comparable to the photon energy density Uph in\na wide range of systems, with UB \u223c few\u221210 Uph , depending on the form of the Schmidt Law adopted (compare the\ntwo dashed lines in Fig. 3). This result is not as surprising as it might first appear because massive stars determine\nboth the radiation field of galaxies and the energy and momentum injected into their ISM. The latter \"feedback\" can\ngenerate turbulence in the ISM, amplifying the magnetic\nfield. Thompson et al. (2005) and Thompson (2008) have\nsuggested a direct connection between turbulence in dense\nstarbursts and Uph by positing that radiation pressure from\nthe absorption and scattering of stellar light by dust grains\ndominates the overall pressure support. The rapid diffusion\nof infrared photons in starbursts causes the medium to be\ngravitationally unstable (Thompson 2008) and, even in the\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fRadio Emission from Supernova Remnants\nabsence of self-gravity, generates magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that can amplify magnetic fields directly (Turner\net al. 2007). In addition, the momentum supplied to the ISM\nby stellar winds and SN explosions is comparable to that in\nphotons. There are thus a number of sources capable of generating turbulent motions that could amplify magnetic fields\nto the levels inferred here. It is also worth noting that although Bph \u226a Beq for luminous starbursts in Figure 3, this\ndoes not necessarily imply that radiation pressure is dynamically unimportant; the dense gas in starbursts is optically\nthick even in the far infrared and thus the energy density of\nphotons in the densest gas is larger than that in equation\n(2) by a factor of the dust optical depth (see footnote 1),\nwhich can be \u223c 10 \u2212 100 (e.g., Thompson et al. 2005).\n4.3\n\nSNR Luminosity Function\n\nAs a final comment, we note that a more sophisticated understanding of the SNR luminosity function is needed to\nprovide a more quantitative interpretation of the data in Figures 2 & 3. For example, although equation (3) suggests that\n\u03bdL\u03bd is independent of time, the radio luminosity of a given\nSNR will peak at its Sedov time and then decline when the\nremnant cools and the shock loses energy (the radio luminosity can decline more quickly if tsyn is short or if the relativistic electrons rapidly diffuse out of the remnant; see, e.g., van\nder Laan 1962; Baring et al. 1999; Berezhko & V\u00f6lk 2004). If\nthe average ISM magnetic field is volume-filling, and if SNe\nsample the medium fairly, taking an average density of Arp\n220 of hni \u223c 104 cm\u22123 and a SN rate of \u223c 1 yr\u22121 , we estimate that \u223c 103 SNRs should be visible in the radio, which\nis at odds with the \u223c 50 SNRs identified (e.g., Lonsdale et\nal. 2006). However, there is an important set of mitigating\neffects. First, calculations of high Mach number isothermal\nturbulence imply that for the conditions of Arp 220 the average medium is filled with gas with n \u223c 10\u22122 hni \u2248 102 cm\u22123\n(e.g., LeMaster & Stone 2008). Second, although the synchrotron cooling time tsyn is longer for lower ambient density (because of an assumed smaller BISM ), and one might\nthus expect to see more remnants, the SNRs at t \u223c tsyn are\nalso physically larger: for n = 102 cm\u22123 a remnant expands\nto \u2248 4 pc by \u223c tsyn . For Arp 220, this is large enough that\nthe SNRs would overlap on the sky and be resolved out by\ncurrent VLBI observations. The radio luminosity function\nof SNRs is thus a convolution of the spatial variation of the\nISM conditions into which SNe explode (e.g., variations in\n\u03c1ISM and BISM ), the time-dependence of an individual remnant, and the sensitivity and resolution of the observation. A\ncareful study of these effects might provide important constraints on the nature of the ISM - the statistics of the\ndensity field and its magnetization - in external galaxies.\nIn addition, it would more quantitatively determine the importance of post-shock magnetic field amplification in SNRs,\nand how the average (or maximum) SNR luminosity is related to the host galaxy's volume-averaged ISM magnetic\nfield strength.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Anatoly Spitkovsky, Boaz Katz, Roger Chevalier,\nHeinrich V\u00f6lk, and the anonymous referee for comments that\nimproved this paper.

Both the highest SNR luminosity (Cass A) and the average\nSNR luminosity are unchanged: log10 [\u03bdLmean\n(1.4 GHz; ergs s\u22121 )] \u2248 34.5 and \u2248 33.5, respectively. However, for the full Green catalog of\n\u03bd\n38 sources (listed above), log10 [\u03bdLmean\n(1.4 GHz; ergs s\u22121 )] decreases to 33.2, a factor of \u2248 2.0 lower than the smaller sample of Case &\n\u03bd\nBhattacharya (1998).\np Distance from Gieren et al.
