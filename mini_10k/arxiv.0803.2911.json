For f = 0, the transformation is one introduced by Wegner in\ncondensed matter physics, and for f = 1 it is a simpler transformation that is being used in nuclear\ntheory. The transformation with f = 0 diagonalizes the Hamiltonian but in the transformations\nwith f near 1 divergent couplings arise as bound state thresholds emerge.

The f = 0 transformation\nplaces bound-state eigenvalues on the diagonal at their natural scale, after which the bound states\ndecouple from the dynamics at much smaller momentum scales.

In discrete models, there is a critical\nvalue, fc , below which bound state eigenvalues appear at their natural scale and the entire flow to\nthe diagonal is well-behaved.

Such transformations allow one to tune an effective\ntheory resolution, focusing on essential degrees of freedom and interactions at any scale of\ninterest. Anticipated by Kadanoff's block spin transformation [1], early transformations explicitly reduced the number of degrees of freedom by lowering cutoffs on energy [2, 3]. Glazek\nand Wilson introduced a similarity renormalization group (SRG) procedure which instead\nuses transformations that do not remove any degrees of freedom but eliminate couplings\nbetween disparate energy scales [4, 5, 6]. After regularization and identification of necessary\ncounterterms, the SRG procedure eventually produces a renormalized, band-diagonal matrix\nrepresentation of the Hamiltonian. Independently, Wegner introduced non-perturbative differential flow equations that unitarily transform Hamiltonian matrices to the band-diagonal\nform [7, 8], and Wegner's flow equations can be employed in the SRG procedure.\nA simplified version of Wegner's transformation [9] has been successfully applied to a\nnumber of nuclear few-body problems [10, 11]. Nuclear many-body calculations are plagued\nby strong nucleon-nucleon correlations due to a hard core and strong short-range tensor force,\nso perturbative and variational methods converge poorly. The new simple transformation\nproduces universal nucleon-nucleon interactions with drastically improved perturbative and\nvariational behavior. It has also been shown that one can apply SRG with Wegner's flow (or\na suitably altered flow) for studying the connection between asymptotic freedom and limit\ncycles [12] and it has been suggested that an infrared limit cycle may exist in QCD [13].\nThese examples indicate that convergence properties of SRG transformations are relevant\nto the theory of particles over a broad range of energies.\nWe find that convergence properties of the simple transformation are worse than those\nof Wegner's transformation. The simple transformation tends to diverge whenever the SRG\nparameter approaches the momentum scale at which a bound state is formed in the theory. This effect may present no problem for applications in low-energy nuclear physics as\nlong as the SRG parameter stays larger than the momentum scales at which formation of\nbound states occurs. However, such fortunate conditions may not be available if the Efimov\neffect [14, 15, 16] in the three-nucleon problem [17, 18, 19, 20] cannot be avoided. The\n\n2\n\n\fEfimov effect shows up as a limit cycle. We will see that Wegner's transformation is capable of resolving limit cycle behavior, while the simple transformation diverges as the first\nhigh-energy cycle is resolved.\nTransform a Hamiltonian H(0) using a unitary operator U (s),\nH(s) = U (s)H(0)U \u2020 (s) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the SRG flow parameter. We want to choose U (s) so that H is diagonalized as\ns \u2192 \u221e (band-diagonalized for finite s). We choose s = 0 for the initial value, so H(0)\ncan be thought of as an input bare regularized Hamiltonian with all required and properly\nadjusted counterterms (such Hamiltonians are established using the same SRG procedure\nbut this aspect is not in our focus here).\nTaking derivatives of both sides of Eq. (1), we see that H(s) evolves according to\ndH(s)\n= [\u03b7(s), H(s)] ,\nds\n\n(2)\n\nwith\n\u03b7(s) =\n\ndU (s) \u2020\nU (s) = \u2212\u03b7 \u2020 (s) .\nds\n\n(3)\n\nChoosing \u03b7(s) specifies the transformation. We study transformations that mix two simple\nchoices,\n\u03b7(s) = [D(s), H(s)] ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere D(s) is the diagonal part of H(s) in momentum representation, and\n\u03b7(s) = [T, H(s)] ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere T is a fixed matrix, here chosen to be the kinetic energy. If one considers T to be an\narbitrary H0 that has a known spectrum, the interaction is the remaining part, HI = H \u2212H0 .\nUsing D in \u03b7 was Wegner's initial choice and this transformation has been studied extensively [8]. The use of T was explored perturbatively [9] and then shown to effectively\ndecouple low- and high-momentum scales in a universal characterization of the nucleonnucleon interaction [10, 11]. Universality in effective nucleon-nucleon interactions was discovered earlier [21, 22] using the same transformation Wilson used in his initial numerical\nRG calculations [2].\nWe will see that using T instead of D produces singularities starting at bound state\nthresholds and limits how far the transformation can be run. But we stress that if it is not\n3\n\n\frun too far, for any phenomenologically tuned nucleon-nucleon interaction H(0) the lowenergy part of H(s) is nearly universal. This means that all infrared-constrained nucleonnucleon interactions with bare cutoffs at or even well above 500 MeV collapse onto a nearly\n\u221a\nuniversal infrared Hamiltonian after the SRG parameter, \u03bb = 1/ s, playing the role of\neffective cutoff, is evolved to well below the bare cutoff. These evolved potentials disagree\nonly on the high-energy part of H(s) , which is not constrained by low-energy physics [11].\nIntroducing a parameter f which takes values in the range [0, 1], we define\nGf (s) = f T + (1 \u2212 f )Df (s),\n\n(6)\n\nand write\nd\nHf (s) = [F {Hf (s)}, Hf (s)] ,\nds\nHf (0) = H ,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nwhere H is an initial Hamiltonian matrix and the SRG generator matrix takes the form\nF {Hf (s)} = [Gf (s), Hf (s)] ,\n\n(9)\n\nand thus defines \u03b7 that depends on f and interpolates between the two cases from Eqs. (4)\nand (5) when f varies from 0 to 1. For explicit calculations one uses a basis in which T is\ndiagonal since it is in this representation that H(s) is driven towards band-diagonal form.\nThe generator F {Hf (s)} is guaranteed to bring the Hamiltonian to diagonal if some\nsufficient and easily verifiable conditions are satisfied. Such conditions will be discussed\nafter we introduce all details that count in the derivation, in the context of two examples of\nbasic interest in physics.\nNamely, we use the family of generators F {Hf (s)} to evolve Hamiltonian matrices that\nexhibit asymptotic freedom and limit cycle behavior. The asymptotically free matrix model\nis easily derived from the nonrelativstic Schr\u00f6dinger equation in two dimensions with a deltafunction potential. Isolate the angular momentum zero states and discretize the momentum\nso that p \u2192 bn p0 with b > 1; include the appropriate weights to reproduce the momentum\nrepresentation bound-state integral equation in the limits where n is allowed to be any\ninteger and b \u2192 1. Introduce cutoffs so that M \u2264 n \u2264 N and you have the matrix we use\nto illustrate asymptotic freedom (M is a large negative and N is a large positive integer\nnumber). The limit cycle model is obtained by adding an imaginary part to the same\n4\n\n\fasymptotically free model Hamiltonian. The operator T can be replaced by any Hermitian\noperator one wants to use and the methods we employ in this study can still be applied.\n\nII.\n\nDETAILS OF EQUATIONS\n\nThe equations for a fixed value of f contain the diagonal matrix Gf (s) given in Eq. (6)\nthat contains the diagonal part of Hf (s). The Hamiltonian matrix is split into its diagonal\nand off-diagonal parts at every value of s,\nHf (s) = Df (s) + Vf (s) .\n\n(10)\n\nThis splitting implies also\nHf (s) = Gf (s) + [Hf (s) \u2212 Gf (s)]\n= Gf (s) + f [Df (s) \u2212 T ] + Vf (s) .\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThis means that the diagonal part of the interaction is included in Df (s). The important\npoint is that only Vf (s) has non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements. Diagonal matrix elements of Vf (s) are zero. T and Df (s) are diagonal and we use an abbreviated notation\nfor their matrix elements: Tmn = Tm \u03b4mn , Df mn (s) = Dm \u03b4mn , and Gf mn (s) = Gm \u03b4mn . Our\nabbreviated notation for interaction matrix elements is Vf mn (s) = (1 \u2212 \u03b4mn )Vmn , where V is\nthe full interaction part in the matrix Hf (s) = T + V .\nThe SRG Eq. (7) implies\nX\nd\nDn = 2\n(Gn \u2212 Gk )Vnk Vkn ,\nds\nk\n\n(13)\n\nX\nd\nVm6=n = \u2212(Gm \u2212 Gn )(Dm \u2212 Dn )Vmn +\n(Gm + Gn \u2212 2Gk )Vmk Vkn .\nds\nm6=k6=n\n\n(14)\n\nWe solve these equations numerically, starting from\nHf (0)mn =\n\np\nEm En [ \u03b4mn \u2212 g \u2212 ih sgn(m \u2212 n) ] ,\n\n(15)\n\nE n = bn ,\n\n(16)\n\nM \u2264 n \u2264N.\n\n(17)\n\nIn the case of the model with asymptotic freedom, the coupling constant h is set to 0,\nthe Hamiltonian matrix is real and Eqs. (13) and (14) display all relevant formulae. In\n5\n\n\fthe case of the model with a limit cycle, the Hamiltonian contains an imaginary part and\nthe equations we use to compute the Hamiltonian flow numerically involve the imaginary\ncomponents,\nHf (s)mn = rmn + icmn ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere r is a real symmetric matrix and c is a real antisymmetric matrix. Thus, Dm = rmm .\nWith this notation, the SRG equations we solve are\nX\nd\n2\nDn = 2\n(Gn \u2212 Gk )(rnk\n+ c2nk ) ,\nds\nk\n\n(19)\n\nX\nd\nrm6=n = \u2212(Gm \u2212 Gn )(Dm \u2212 Dn )rmn +\n(Gm + Gn \u2212 2Gk )(rmk rnk + cnk cmk ) ,\nds\nm6=k6=n\n(20)\nd\n(Gm + Gn \u2212 2Gk )(cmk rnk \u2212 cnk rmk ) .\ncmn = \u2212(Gm \u2212 Gn )(Dm \u2212 Dn )cmn +\nds\nm6=k6=n\nX\n\n(21)\nWe will show that to a good approximation Hf (s) retains the form of Hf (0) for matrix\n\u221a\nelements between states with kinetic energies well below the SRG parameter \u03bb = 1/ s. The\ndominant change that occurs in these matrix elements is that g is replaced by gf (s). This\nfeature emerges in numerical calculations. We also analytically derive this result in the limit\nof large b in the next section.\nOnce it is established through numerically calculated non-perturbative evolution of the\nwhole Hamiltonian that its evolution can be reduced to the evolution of the coupling constant\ngf (s), we focus discussion on the evolution of the coupling and its dependence on f . The\ncoupling constant is defined as\ngf (s) = 1 \u2212 Hf (s)M M /EM ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere EM is the smallest energy in the matrix representation of the theory (smallest allowed\neigenvalue of T ) and Hf (s)M M is the smallest energy diagonal matrix element of Hf (s), the\ninfrared corner of the Hamiltonian. We can choose any diagonal or off-diagonal matrix\nelement near the infrared corner of the Hamiltonian matrix to define the same coupling\nconstant and no significant changes result until this element begins to freeze at its asymptotic\nlimit as s \u2192 \u221e. Each matrix element follows a universal trajectory until it freezes at its\ns \u2192 \u221e value. Only the lowest diagonal element displays the full evolution of the diagonal.\n6\n\n\fWhen G differs from D, i.e., f > 0, we show that the SRG transformation does not\nnecessarily bring the Hamiltonian matrix to diagonal form as s \u2192 \u221e. However, there is a\nsufficient condition for cases with f > 0 that will be derived in Section IV. Namely,\ndV\n> \u22121 ,\ndT\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the derivative means the rate of change of matrix elements of V along the diagonal\nin units of rate of change of eigenvalues of T along the diagonal. This condition could be\nviolated when bound-state (negative) eigenvalues appear on the diagonal among positive\neigenvalues. To study how the SRG transformation behaves depending on the choice of f\nin the presenece of bound states, and in particular what happens in the case f = 1 that\nis useful in nuclear physics, one needs to see what happens in the generic models when f\ndeviates from 0 and reaches 1. Since the sufficient condition could be violated when the\nSRG parameter \u03bb passes the momentum scale of binding, one should find out how Hf (s)\nbehaves around s corresponding to this region.\nIn the next section we discuss results of calculations of Hf (s). We show that Wegner's\ntransformation (f = 0) encounters no difficulty and places bound-state eigenvalues on the\ndiagonal when \u03bb approaches the appropriate bound-state scale from above. The f = 1 transformation breaks down as the effective cutoff approaches a bound-state scale. In fact, the\ntransformation moves the bound-state eigenvalue to the infrared corner of the Hamiltonian.\nWhen the minimal momentum scale is much less than the bound-state momentum scale,\nthe f = 1 transformation forces off-diagonal matrix elements to diverge in order to move\nthe bound-state eigenvalue to such a significantly wrong scale.\nFor values of f between these two extremes the transformation puts the bound-state\neigenvalue on the diagonal at some scale between the natural one and the infrared cutoff.\nHowever, for f approaching 1, the amount of shift approaches the maximal possible and\ncorrespondingly large couplings must be generated on the way. For f = 1, the transformation\nbecomes numerically unstable near the bound-state scale when the infrared cutoff tends to\nzero.\nIn discrete matrix notation, one can ask how large a value of f > 0 causes the first shift\nof the bound-state eigenvalue down the diagonal, just by one free energy level in comparison\nto the Wegner case (f = 0). This value of f will be called critical, and denoted by fc . It\ncan be computed numerically to high accuracy.\n7\n\n\fIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS: ASYMPTOTIC FREEDOM\n\nThe characteristic SRG behavior displayed by the full matrix Hf (s) is difficult to grasp\n(in our typical cases, the matrix has about 2000 matrix elements, each a function of s that\nranges from 0 to \u221e) without studying a number of cases. Such studies involve large amounts\nof data. Fortunately, the overall result of such studies is that the essence of what happens\nfor large matrices can be explained in a simple way using just one running coupling constant.\nMost interestingly, the characteristic behavior of this one running coupling constant in large\nmatrices can be explained using much smaller matrices, and a matrix that is only 3x3 in\nsize will be sufficient. These two facts guide the way we present and discuss our results.\nOur goal is to describe the most important qualitative features of the Hamiltonian evolv\u221a\ning from its initial form of the type Em En (\u03b4mn \u2212 g) to complete diagonalization. We\nneed to cover a large range of scales and make important features of V at all scales visible\nsimultaneously. Taking our cue from the initial Hamiltonian and experience gathered in observing many examples of the SRG flows, we display what we will call the scaled interaction,\n\u221a\nVmn = Vmn (s)/ Em En . Matrix elements of the scaled interaction are all of O(1) or decay to\n0 during the entire process of diagonalization when Wegner's transformation is used (f = 0).\nWhen f = 1 however, matrix elements of V diverge as the bound-state threshold is reached\n(see below).\nThroughout its evolution, the scaled interaction matrix can be approximated by Vmn \u223c\n\u2212gf (s) + corrections for subscripts m and n below the transition region, in which the\nsubscripts m and n take values k such that sEk2 \u223c 1. Well above the transition region the\nHamiltonian matrix is diagonalized. As s increases, gf (s) increases to a maximum, at which\npoint the bound-state negative eigenvalue emerges on the diagonal or a process of shifting\nthe bound-state eigenvalue down the diagonal begins.\nWe start with the model case of asymptotic freedom (a discretized \u03b4-function in two\ndimensions), for which h in eq. (15) is zero and the single bound-state eigenvalue determines\ng through dimensional transmutation. In the notation of Section II, cmn = 0 and rmn (s =\n\u221a\n0) = Em En (\u03b4mn \u2212 g). We consider g = 0.0400022797581725654. (This particular value\nof g is not significant; it is found from the condition that for h = 0, b = 4, N = 16,\nM = \u221225, the bound-state eigenvalue is with high accuracy the same as one of the boundstate eigenvalues in another case: one with a limit cycle for g = 0 and h = tan \u03c0/50, and\n\n8\n\n\feigenvalue E \u223c \u22127.644479 10\u22126 , see [12].)\n3\nbinding energies are orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe cutoffs on momenta. Hadronic structure is different.\nAlso, when one proceeds to the case of limit cycle with\na geometric series of binding energies, one has to secure\nthat the largest of them is small in comparison with desired values of \u03bb for the generator with G = T to work.\n\nIV.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nCONCLUSION\n1\n\nIn order to make the SRG procedure work across the\nscale of binding, in the cases with asymptotic freedom\nor limit cycle, it may be necessary to include dynamical effects in the generator [G, H], such as indicated by\nf != 1 in this study. Thus, this study shows that one\nneeds to do something akin to the old idea of writing\nH(s0 ) = H0 (s0 )+[H(s0 )\u2212H0 (s0 )], where H0 (s) contains\nsome approximate dynamics one knows how to handle,\nknowing also that the operator in the square bracket is\n\"small,\" and use H0 instead of T = k 2 /(2m) or similar\nkinematical operators. The new element introduced here\nusing the SRG procedure is that one can introduce H0\n\u221a\nat some \u03bb0 = 1/ s0 that is not very far in magnitude\nfrom the order of the energy (actually, momentum) scale\nthat characterizes the physics of interest. One does not\nintroduce H0 in the initial Hamiltonian that couples dynamically a huge number of states at every scale (the initial Hamiltonian corresponds to \u03bb = \u221e, or s = 0). The\nsimplest version of introducing such H0 (s0 ) would be to\nidentify basis states for which one needs to insert corrections in the diagonal matrix elements of G [5\u20137]. Such\napproach in quantum field theory corresponds to introduction of auxiliary potentials [8] or mass-like terms [9]\nthat are gradually eliminated from the theory when the\naccuracy of calculations increases.\nThis study demonstrates that the SRG procedure can\naccommodate the necessary dynamical effects in a general and systematic way. Given the complexity of threebody dynamics [10] and problems that arise when more\nparticles interact (in particle, nuclear, atomic, and condensed matter physics), the SRG procedure requires further study and development.\nOne direction, implied by this study, is to include dynamical effects in G. The other direction (currently hypothetical) is to seek ways of avoiding divergences in the\nmatrix elements of Hf (\u03bb) for \u03bb of interest by carefully\ndesigning basis states so that the divergence at small energies (long distances) due to the phenomenon of binding is avoided without losing control on the RG evolution across the scale of strongest binding to lower scales.\nHowever, if \u03bb can be always kept much larger in size than\nthe binding energies, purely kinematical generators may\ncontinue to work.\nWhether one can resolve a geometric spectrum converging on 0 (such as in the case of 3-body system with\nzero binding in two-body system) in a limit cycle studied\nusing SRG with \u03bb greater than the modulus of the most\nstrongly bound state in the series remains to be found.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3: Evolution of the Hamiltonian matrix: the vertical\naxis indicates the size of the potential matrix\n! element Vij of\nEi Ej , while the\nthe matrix V in H = T + V , divided by\nhorizontal axes correspond to the subscripts i and j, running\nfrom M to N , counting from left to right and from the front\nto back of the pictures.\n\nFIG. 1: SRG evolution of H = T + V with \u03bb for f = 0. Successive frames correspond to entries\nin Table I.

See text for details.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we display frames from a movie of the evolving interaction, V (s), in the\nHamiltonian H = T + V , using Wegner's transformation, f = 0. We show \u2212Vmn . Since\nsmall-energy matrix elements of V equal the negative of the coupling constant, we need to\ndisplay \u2212V instead of V itself in order to directly show how well the one coupling constant\ngf =0 (s) approximates the evolution of V below the transition region and at the same time\nshow how the coupling constant itself evolves. With these rescaling and display conventions,\n\u221a\nT is the identity matrix. To get Hmn / Em En , simply take the negative of the displayed values of \u2212V and add peaks of height one along the diagonal in each frame. Details concerning\nthe frames shown in Fig. 1 are listed in Table I.\nThe negative of the scaled interaction is initially a featureless plane (frame 1), its size\nfixed at about 0.04, just above zero because it is a negative of a momentum representation\n9\n\n\fTABLE I: SRG parameters g and \u03bb for frames shown in Fig. 1, numbered from the top to bottom.\nIn this example, g = 0.040002, h = 0, b = 4, M = \u221225, N = 16, and all displayed numbers are\nrounded to 6 decimal places.\nframe\n\nln(\u03bb)/ ln b\n\ng(\u03bb)\n\n1 (top)\n\n22.780321\n\n0.040002\n\n2\n\n2.766096\n\n0.092055\n\n3\n\n-6.864809\n\n0.600768\n\n4\n\n-8.369638\n\n1.234710\n\n5\n\n-8.570281\n\n0.891475\n\n6\n\n-9.071891\n\n-0.680443\n\n7\n\n-12.282193\n\n-0.226083\n\n8 (bottom)\n\n-27.330482\n\n-0.060769\n\nof an atractive delta-function in position representation with the initial value of the coupling\nconstant g \u223c 0.04. As s increases from 0, the plane drops to zero at highest energies, creating\na cliff (frame 2) between the low and high energy parts of the matrix (transition region).\nThis cliff runs along a single row and column that meet on the point along the diagonal at\nwhich newly decoupled eigenvalues are emerging. The cliff moves towards lower energies and\ngrows in height as s increases (frame 3), showing evolution of the transition region between a\nflat plane of zeroed high-energy off-diagonal matrix elements of V and a low-energy plateau\nthat is rising higher as s increases (that this plateau rises means that the coupling constant\nincreases and the potential itself becomes more negative). The positive peaks left along the\nhigh-energy diagonal decouple from the rest of the matrix when the ridge moves past and\nthey are basically left at the height of the low-energy rising plane at the decoupling point.\nThis process continues, with the low-energy part of the matrix rising and high-energy\neigenvalues being left in isolation on the diagonal as the growing cliff separating low and\nhigh energy portions of the Hamiltonian moves towards the infrared corner of the matrix\nand the off-diagonal high-energy part of the matrix settles to zero.\nWe display a frame in which many high-energy eigenvalues are in place and the lowenergy plateau has barely fallen from its maximum height (frame 4), at a point where a\nbound state is going to emerge on the diagonal of H(s). Remember that what we are\n10\n\n\fshowing is \u2212V, which must be multiplied by\n\n\u221a\nEm En and subtracted from T to produce\n\nH(s). Two important things happen: the low-energy plane is high enough to cancel T and\nproduce a negative eigenvalue on the diagonal, and as this bound-state eigenvalue is left on\nthe diagonal the low-energy plane reverses its motion (frames 4 and 5) and drops rapidly to\nnegative values (frame 6, the coupling constant becomes negative and the whole interaction\n\u223c gf (s) becomes positive, i.e., repulsive).\nAfter the bound-state threshold is crossed, V adds to the eigenvalues of T , while up to this\npoint it had subtracted from these eigenvalues. After quickly reaching its deepest level, the\nlow-energy plane gradually rises to zero (frames 7 and 8), leaving a sequence of eigenvalues\nthat smoothly emerge from this flow one after another toward the infrared corner.\nThe only violent changes in these scaled variables appear around the point where the\nbound state emerges. This is where the coupling that characterizes the evolution of the lowenergy part of the matrix grows to its maximum value, before dropping rapidly to negative\nvalues.\nIt is clear that the evolution of the entire matrix V is well-described by the evolution of\ngf (s) in the case of f = 0. The same is true in all other cases we consider. Therefore, we\nwill present only the functions gf (s) in all these cases rather than frames from many movies.\nThe behavior of coupling constants in the case of asymptotic freedom for various values\nof f is shown in Fig. 2. In the f = 1 case, evolution of H(s) is nearly identical to the f = 0\nevolution until the bound state begins to emerge. The low-energy plane in V moves up to\nproduce the bound-state eigenvalue, but the bound state does not decouple from further\nevolution and the low-energy plane simply continues to grow apparently indefinitely and our\nnumerical calculations fail to converge.\nThe f = 1 transformation becomes singular because it tries to move the bound-state\neigenvalue to the lowest-energy diagonal matrix element of the Hamiltonian, as we discuss\nbelow and explain in greater detail in the next section. This means that the bound-state\nwave function is being forced to include only disparately small momenta. As a result, the\ninteractions are forced to grow to maintain observables at their true values. If the evolution\nis halted before the bound-state emerges, the pathological rise of interaction terms does not\noccur yet.\nOne can see in Fig. 2 not only that the larger f the larger the maximal value of the\ncoupling constant gf at the corresponding value of the argument ln \u03bbf / ln b = tf , but also\n11\n\n\fFIG. 2:\n\nThe coupling constants gf in the case of asymptotic freedom, plotted as a function of\n\nln \u03bb/ ln b (instead of s = 1/\u03bb2 ) for 6 values of f : f = 0 (Wegner), f = 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, and\n1. The correspondence between a curve and f is such that the curves for larger f reach higher\nand for f = 1 the corresponding curve apparently shoots to infinity around \u03bb \u223c |Eboundstate |. The\nultraviolet cutoff is at b16 , and b = 4.\n\nthat simultaneously the argument tf where the maximum of gf is reached decreases when f\nincreases. In fact, when f increases sufficiently to cause a shift of the bound-state eigenvalue\nby one state down the diagonal in comparison to the case f = 0, the maximal coupling\nconstant must increase by factor b, when f increases sufficiently to shift the bound-state\neigenvalue by two states down the diagonal, the maximal coupling constant must increase\nby factor b2 , and so on. Since Fig. 2 concerns the case with b = 4, the maximal values of\nthe coupling are about 4 and then 16 when the bound-state eigenvalue is shifted by one and\ntwo states down the diagonal, respectively. The next shift requires gf \u223c 64 and this leads\nto the coupling that grows out of proportion in Fig. 2. When f = 1, the shift occurs to the\nminimal possible value t1 = M , and this requires that g1 reaches b|M | Eboundstate \u223c b25\u22129 = 416\nin the case illustrated in Fig. 2. With typical machine limitations, numerical calculations\nare expected to fail below the scale of binding if one uses the generator F {H(s)} with G in\nwhich f = 1.\n\n12\n\n\fIV.\n\nCONVERGENCE PROBLEMS AND THE 3 \u00d7 3 MATRIX\n\nIn this section, we explain the phenomenon of rise of the coupling constant when the SRG\nparameter approaches the scale of binding in the asymptotically free model. After that we\nwill discuss what happens in the model with limit cycle.\nWe reduce the asymptotically free model to a 3\u00d73 matrix, allowing b to become arbitrarily\nlarge (i.e., there are only three, strongly coupled degrees of freedom of drastically different\nmomentum scales), and show an analytic analysis that explains the behavior observed in the\nfull SRG calculation for the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix. The 3 \u00d7 3 matrix model explains the mechanism\nthat is also at work in large matrices in our models with asymptotic freedom or limit cycle.\nIn the 3 \u00d7 3 case, there is a low-energy effective coupling that evolves smoothly as the\nhighest energy scale is decoupled by the SRG transformation. At a characteristic \"time\" s,\na 2 \u00d7 2 low-energy effective Hamiltonian emerges, characterized by gf (s), and this coupling\nexceeds some critical value when a bound state emerges. For f = fc , the sign of the dominant\nterm driving further off-diagonal evolution changes, and fc can be computed analytically in\nthe simple 3 \u00d7 3 example. Above fc the remaining off-diagonal matrix element is forced to\ndiverge as a power of b to force the low-energy diagonal to accommodate an eigenvalue of the\nwrong magnitude (wrong in the sense that it is much larger in size than the corresponding\neigenvalue of T ). The b \u2192 \u221e limit of the full 3 \u00d7 3 matrix evolution can be analyzed\nanalytically, and this is how we explain the mechanism at work in the full SRG evolution.\nBefore we analyze the drastically simplified 3 \u00d7 3 matrix truncation of the asymptotic\nfreedom model, we recall Wegner's demonstration [7] that his transformation always diagonalizes Hamiltonians, and we use similar reasoning to explain why a simpler transformation\nmight fail to converge.\nFor any similarity transformation, Tr(H 2 ) is independent of s. Separating diagonal and\noff-diagonal contributions to this trace, one finds\nd X\nd X 2\nHmm = \u2212\n| Hmn |2 .\nds m\nds m6=n\n\n(24)\n\nIf the magnitudes of diagonal matrix elements increase, the magnitudes of off-diagonal matrix\n\n13\n\n\felements must decrease. Using eq. (13) for the evolution of the diagonal matrix elements,\nX\nd X 2\nHmm = 4\nDm (Gm \u2212 Gn ) | Vmn |2\nds m\nmn\nX\n= 2\n(Dm \u2212 Dn )(Gm \u2212 Gn ) | Vmn |2 .\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nmn\n\nFor Wegner's transformation, Gm = Dm , so we have\nX\nd X 2\n(Dm \u2212 Dn )2 | Vmn |2 .\nHmm = 2\nds m\nmn\n\n(27)\n\nNo term in this sum can be negative, so the only way Wegner's transformation can stop\ndriving off-diagonal matrix elements to zero is if degeneracies appear on the diagonal. In\nthis case, the matrix is driven to block diagonal form with diagonal degeneracies in any\nnon-diagonalized blocks.\nIn general, from Eq. (26) we see that negative terms cannot appear on the right-hand-side\nwhen all differences Dm \u2212 Dn and Gm \u2212 Gn always satisfy the condition\n(Gm \u2212 Gn )(Dm \u2212 Dn ) \u2265 0 .\n\n(28)\n\nIntroducing (\u2206T )mn = Tm \u2212 Tn and (\u2206V )mn = Vmm \u2212 Vnn , one obtains for every pair of\ndiagonal elements number m and n,\n[f \u2206T + (1 \u2212 f )(\u2206T + \u2206V )](\u2206T + \u2206V ) \u2265 0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich, by dividing by \u2206T > 0 for m > n, implies that v = \u2206V /\u2206T must satisfy the\ncondition\n[f + (1 \u2212 f )(1 + v)](1 + v) \u2265 0 .\nThis condition implies for f \u2208 [0, 1] that either v \u2264\n\n1\nf \u22121\n\n(30)\n\nor v \u2265 \u22121 and only for f = 0\n\n(Wegner's generator) these two regions can join while for f > 0 they are always disjoint.\nInstead of differences for arbitrary m and n, it is sufficient to consider differences with\nm = n + 1, since all differences can be built from the differences between neighboring entries\non the diagonal. Then, in the limit of continuous energy variable, the limit of \u2206T \u2192 0\nproduces the condition\ndV\n1\n\u2264\ndT\nf \u22121\n\nor\n14\n\ndV\n\u2265 \u22121 ,\ndT\n\n(31)\n\n\fas a sufficient one for the transformation to always bring H near the diagonal (outside\nregions of degeneracy mentioned earlier).\nWhen f = 1, Gm = Tm , and we see that convergence can fail if\n\u2206V\n< \u22121\n\u2206T\n\n(32)\n\nfor some momenta. Tm increases monotonically with m, so we see that problems can appear\nif Vm decreases rapidly with m in some region. This is exactly what happens when a negative\nvalue appears on the diagonal, signaling the appearance of a bound-state threshold. The\nappearance of negative values on the diagonal does not guarantee that the transformation\nwill stop driving off-diagonal matrix elements to zero, and it gives no indication that offdiagonal matrix elements will actually start to diverge, but it indicates how problems can\narise.\nTo gain further insight, we proceed to a study of the b \u2192 \u221e limit, which drastically\nsimplifies the couplings between various scales, and for further simplicity we truncate the\nasymptotically free Hamiltonian model to a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix. We refer to the three remaining\nscales as high, middle and low, and we write the initial Hamiltonian as:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\u221a\nb\nb 1\nb\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\u221a\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nH(0) = \uf8ec0 1 0 \uf8f7 \u2212 g \uf8ec b 1 \u221a1 \uf8f7 ,\nb\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 0 1b\n1 \u221a1b 1b\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the first matrix is T and the second is V (0). We choose g so that the single negative\neigenvalue is O(1) and should appear in the middle of the final diagonalized matrix in the\ncase f = 0. These conditions imply that 0.5 < g < 1 and g must be more than O( 1b ) away\nfrom either extreme. The three eigenvalues are (1 \u2212 g)b + O(1), (1 \u2212 2g)/(1 \u2212 g) + O(1/b)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nand (1 \u2212 3g)/(1 \u2212 2g) /b + O(1/b2 ).\nWe define six couplings in the running interaction,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u221a\n\uf8ec \u2212dh\u221ab \u2212gh b \u2212gm \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nVf (s) = \uf8ec\u2212gh b \u2212dm \u2212 \u221agl \uf8f7 ,\nb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u2212gm\n\u2212 \u221aglb \u2212 dbl\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the diagonal couplings dh , dm and dl , and the off-diagonal couplings gh , gm and gl are\nall functions of s. At s = 0 all of these couplings are equal to g. The scaled interaction V is\nobtained from Vf (s) by replacement of b by 1.\n15\n\n\fOur goal is to obtain accurate estimates for all matrix elements of Vf (s), even though\ntheir magnitudes span many orders. We cannot allow small errors in large eigenvalues or\nfar off-diagonal matrix elements to produce large errors in small diagonal matrix elements\nthat should reproduce the eigenvalues of order 1 or 1/b, the prototypical renormalization\nproblem. As b \u2192 \u221e this problem can be analyzed analytically.\nWe find evolution of the coupling constants in Eq. (34) using Eqs. (13) and (14).

We use Eqs. (35)-(40) and\nkeep only the leading terms for large b. We will see that all couplings remain O(1) when\nf = 0, so this analysis is fairly straightforward. The evolution has two stages: elimination\nof gh and gm in the first stage, and elimination of gl in the second stage. Terms driving\nthe first stage of evolution are O(b2 ) and govern evolution until s exceeds O(1/b2 ). These\nterms are then exponentially suppressed by gh and gm , and the second stage of evolution is\n16\n\n\fgoverned by subleading terms. The leading terms are:\nd\ndh\nds\nd\ndm\nds\nd\ndl\nds\nd\ngh\nds\nd\ngm\nds\nd\ngl\nds\n\n= \u22122(1 \u2212 dh )gh2 b + O(1) ,\n\n(47)\n\n= 2(1 \u2212 dh )gh2 b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(48)\n\n2 2\n= 2(1 \u2212 dh )gm\nb + O(1) ,\n\n(49)\n\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 dh )2 gh b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(50)\n\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 dh )2 gm b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(51)\n\n= 2(1 \u2212 dh )gh gm b2 + O(b) .\n\n(52)\n\nWe see from (50) and (51) that gh = gm during the first stage, because all couplings start\nat g. This implies that dm = dl = gl during this stage also, because the leading equations\ngoverning their evolution become identical. Since the low energy 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix of V is\ndetermined by dm , dl and gl , it retains its original form during the first stage of evolution,\nwith a single coupling that can be factored from the submatrix of V. This is one of the most\nimportant results of this analysis and it can be generalized to larger matrices.\nThe leading term on the right of Eq. (47) is O(b) rather than O(b2 ), so for s of O(1/b2 ),\ndh changes only by O(1/b) and we can ignore this change when solving Eqs. (50) and (51),\nreplacing dh with its initial value, g. Solving Eqs. (50) and (51) for large b we obtain\n2 b2 s\n\ngh (s) \u2248 gm (s) \u2248 g e\u2212(1\u2212g)\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nBoth of these couplings decay to zero exponentially, and for large b this decay is so rapid\nthat it can be treated as instantaneous.

For a complete leading-order analysis, we need\nonly these leading approximations for gh , gm and dh . The largest eigenvalue, (1 \u2212 dh )b \u2248\n(1 \u2212 g)b + O(1) thus appears in the high-energy corner of the matrix. We do not need the\nO(1/b) correction to dh to obtain the highest eigenvalue accurately for large b and we will\nsee that we do not need this correction to accurately compute the smaller eigenvalues either.\nThe leading term governing the early evolution of the remaining 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix is\n2 b2 s\n\n2(1 \u2212 dh )gh2 b2 \u2248 2(1 \u2212 g)g 2 b2 e\u22122(1\u2212g)\n17\n\n\u2248\n\ng2\n\u03b4(s) ,\n1\u2212g\n\n(55)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4(s) is defined so that\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n\u03b4(s) ds = 1.

Corrections to these\napproximations have no effect on the leading order of any eigenvalue. For example, the\nO(1/b) correction to dh has no effect on the smallest eigenvalue, which is O(1/b). Returning\nto the full equations, replacing gh , gm and dh with these approximations, choosing an initial\nvalue of g/(1 \u2212 g) for dm , dl and gl , we find the leading-order equations that govern the\nsecond stage of evolution:\n1\nd\ndm \u2248 \u22122(1 \u2212 dm )gl2 \u2248 0 ,\nds\nb\nd\ndl \u2248 2(1 \u2212 dm )gl2 ,\nds\nd\ngl \u2248 \u2212(1 \u2212 dm )2 gl .\nds\n\n(57)\n(58)\n(59)\n\nWhen g, the initial coupling, is chosen so that the binding energy is O(1), 1 \u2212 dm < 0 at\nthe start of the second stage and for large b, dm does not evolve further. This means that\nthe negative eigenvalue, 1 \u2212 dm = 1 \u2212 g/(1 \u2212 g) = (1 \u2212 2g)/(1 \u2212 g) appears in the middle of\nthe matrix and stays there.

We again use Eqs. (35)-(40) and keep\nonly the leading terms for large b for the first stage of the evolution. We will see that gh and\ngm again decay exponentially and all other couplings remain O(1) during this first stage,\nbut when f = 1 the coupling gl grows during the second-stage to O(b1/2 ) before it is finally\ndriven to zero and the second-stage's analysis is much more complicated because of this\nunnatural growth. The leading terms for f = 1 are:\nd\ndh\nds\nd\ndm\nds\nd\ndl\nds\nd\ngh\nds\nd\ngm\nds\nd\ngl\nds\n\n= \u22122gh2 b + O(1) ,\n\n(64)\n\n= 2gh2 b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(65)\n\n2 2\n= 2gm\nb + O(1) ,\n\n(66)\n\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 dh )gh b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(67)\n\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 dh )gm b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(68)\n\n= 2gh gm b2 + O(b) .\n\n(69)\n\nThese equations govern the first stage of the SRG evolution, with subleading terms becoming\nimportant in the second stage. We again see that gh = gm to leading order, which implies\nthat dm = dl = gl to leading order during the first stage. The low energy 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix\nis determined by these three couplings, and it retains the form of the initial Hamiltonian\nfor all values of f during the first stage of evolution, so we can use the universal coupling\ngoverning the submatrix to characterize the transformation for all values of f . Solving the\nequations for gh and gm for large b, using the fact that dh = g + O(1/b), we obtain\n2\n\ngh (s) \u2248 gm (s) \u2248 g e\u2212(1\u2212g)b s .\n\n(70)\n\nThis is nearly the same result we obtained in Eq. (53) for f = 0 but the exponent is\ndifferent. Both couplings decay to zero exponentially and dh changes only at O(1/b) because\nthe exponent is O(b2 ) while the term driving the evolution of dh is only O(b). The largest\neigenvalue, (1 \u2212 dh )b \u2248 (1 \u2212 g)b again appears in the high-energy corner of the matrix.\nThe leading term governing the early evolution of the remaining 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix is\n2\n\n2gh2 b2 \u2248 2g 2 b2 e\u22122(1\u2212g)b s \u2248\n19\n\ng2\n\u03b4(s) ,\n1\u2212g\n\n(71)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4(s) is again defined so that\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n\u03b4(s) ds = 1. Once again we find that the couplings\n\ndm , dl and gl instantly increase by g 2 /(1 \u2212 g), to leading order, so at the beginning of the\nsecond stage of evolution\ndm (s) \u2248 dl (s) \u2248 gl (s) \u2248\n\ng\n.\n1\u2212g\n\n(72)\n\nThese second-stage \"initial\" values can differ at O(1/b), but such differences do not affect\nthe subsequent analysis when f = 0. We will see that a full analysis when f = 1 is sensitive\nto such O(1/b) corrections, but we are not interested in the effects of these small corrections.\nWe focus on how the transformation works when the simple scaling analysis breaks down.\nWe want to understand the origin of this breakdown and we can infer its consequences\nwithout a derivation of the precise evolution of the couplings. The origin lies in the specific\nSRG transformation, not in the precise second-stage initial values of the coupling constants.\nFor the range of g that produces an O(1) binding energy, the low- and middle-energy\ncouplings exceed one and negative values again appear on the diagonal of H. However, when\nf = 1 the appearance of negative values on the diagonal can signal trouble, as argued at the\nbeginning of this section.\nAfter the initial stage of evolution, gh \u2248 0, gm \u2248 0 and dh \u2248 g. The subleading terms\nthat govern the second stage of evolution in this case are:\n\u22122 2\nd\ndm \u2248\ng ,\nds\nb l\nd\ndl \u2248 2gl2 ,\nds\nd\n1 \u2212 dl\ngl \u2248 \u2212(1 \u2212 dm )gl +\ngl .\nds\nb\n\n(73)\n(74)\n(75)\n\nWhen the binding energy is O(1), at the start of the second stage 1 \u2212 dm < 0 in Eq. (75), so\ngl grows exponentially rather than decaying as it did when f = 0. Eq. (73) implies that dm\nwill decrease monotonically at O(1/b), but before it can decrease sufficiently to reverse the\n\u221a\ngrowth of gl , gl grows to O( b). Meanwhile, Eq. (74) implies that dl will grow monotonically\nand it eventually grows to O(b) as the bound state eigenvalue is moved from the middle of\nH to its low-energy corner. Once dm decreases sufficiently and dl grows sufficiently, the sign\nof the right-hand-side of Eq. (75) changes and gl is driven to zero exponentially from this\npoint.\nAn exact solution of these equations is readily found because the unitary evolution of the\n2\u00d72 low-energy submatrix of H is simply a rotation that conserves its trace and determinant.\n20\n\n\fSince dm decreases monotonically, the bound state eigenvalue cannot appear in the middle\nof the matrix, as it did when f = 0. The low-energy eigenvalue that is O(1/b) must end up\nin the middle of the matrix, and this means the precise final result of the transformation\nis sensitive to O(1/b) corrections to the initial value of dm , but the mechanism by which\nthe O(1) eigenvalue is transferred to the O(1/b) momentum corner of H is not. Thus, the\nunitarity of the transformation combined with the orders of magnitude of the couplings\ndm , gl and dl at the beginning of the second stage are enough to diagnose why numerical\ntransformations of large matrices fail to converge for some transformations. Moving the\nbound state eigenvalue to an \"unnatural\" location requires growth of couplings by powers of\nb, and in large matrices additional powers of b appear each time the bound state eigenvalue\nis moved one step down along the diagonal.\n\nC.\n\nThe critical value fc\n\nWe do not provide complete details of the full evolution for arbitrary f between zero\nand one; the critical value, fc , is revealed at the end of the first stage of evolution. As the\nbound-state eigenvalue emerges on the diagonal, f determines whether gl grows or decays\nexponentially.\nWe again use Eqs. (35)-(40) and keep only the leading terms for large b.\nd\ndh\nds\nd\ndm\nds\nd\ndl\nds\nd\ngh\nds\nd\ngm\nds\nd\ngl\nds\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u22122 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gh2 b + O(1) ,\n\n(76)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 2 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gh2 b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(77)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 2 2\nb + O(1) ,\n= 2 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gm\n\n(78)\n\n\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2212 1 \u2212 dh 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gh b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(79)\n\n\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2212 1 \u2212 dh 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gm b2 + O(b) ,\n\n(80)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 2 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dh gh gm b2 + O(b) .\n\n(81)\n\nAs expected from the two extremes f = 0 and f = 1, during the first stage of evolution,\ngh = gm , implying that dm = dl = gl . Moreover, the entire analysis of the first stage of\nevolution is qualitatively independent of f .

(53) and (70).\nOnce again the integrated effect of these couplings on the low-energy 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix is\nto shift the submatrix couplings to a new starting value, at s = 0+ = O(1/b2 ),\ngl (0+ ) = dm (0+ ) = dl (0+ ) =\n\ng\n,\n1\u2212g\n\n(83)\n\nafter which we need only examine the equation governing subsequent evolution of gl :\nd\ngl = \u2212 [1 \u2212 dm (s)] [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )dm (s)] gl (s) + O(1/b) .\nds\n\n(84)\n\nThis off-diagonal coupling grows for dm (s) > 1 if\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )\n\ng\n>0,\n1\u2212g\n\n(85)\n\nfrom which we determine\n1\n.\n(86)\ng\nThis value is always between zero and one if there is a bound state with a binding energy\nfc = 2 \u2212\n\nthat is O(1).\nThe evolution of larger matrices as b \u2192 1 is far more complicated than the b \u2192 \u221e limit\nof the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, but there is remarkable similarity. Any stage in the evolution of larger\nmatrices can be modeled by a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix with the middle diagonal matched to the point\non the diagonal where an eigenvalue is emerging. We have focused on the point where a\nbound-state eigenvalue appears, because in the evolution of large matrices with b near 1, it is\nat this point in the SRG evolution of the Hamiltonian that transformations bifurcate; those\nwith f < fc leave the bound state eigenvalue on the diagonal where it appears for f = 0,\nwhile those with f > fc move it down the diagonal. Transformations with f \u2192 1 misplace\nthe bound-state eigenvalue to such small scales that they fail to numerically converge. Offdiagonal matrix elements are forced to diverge exponentially to accomplish this. There\nis always a tipping point, fc < 1, and at fc when the bound state emerges, off-diagonal\nmatrix elements are balanced at an O(1) value between regions of exponential decay and\nexponential growth.\n\nV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS: LIMIT CYCLE\n\nThe limit cycle Hamiltonian of Eq. (15) with h 6= 0 possesses many bound states, one for\neach cycle. The number of eigenvalues that emerge in each cycle is fixed by h. Application\n22\n\n\fof the SRG procedure in the case of a limit cycle is based on [12]. Numerical calculation\nin this case produces Fig. 3. One sees that the case of asymptotic freedom in the previous\nsubsection corresponds in its behavior around the scale of binding to one cycle around\nthe scale of binding in the limit cycle. In addition, one sees that when f \u2192 1 and the\nSRG generator becomes purely kinematic, the RG evolution is stuck in the range of scales\ncorresponding to the scale of binding in the first cycle (greatest binding energy). In order\nto get to the next cycle and smaller binding energies, one has to introduce dynamics into\nthe generator [G, H] through the operator G.\nNote that Fig. 3 also shows that the larger the shifts of the bound-state eigenvalues\ndown the diagonal and the larger the corresponding coupling constant, the more sensitive\nthe numerics are to details of the finite matrix, introducing departures from a clean cycle.\nThese numerical effects are not fully understood but they have no bearing on the findings\nreported here that concern the impact of bound states on the SRG transformations.\nIt is now clear that in the cases where the greatest binding energy E is very small, one\ndoes not encounter problems using purely kinematic G = T as long as \u03bb \u001d |E|. This is our\nexplanation of what happens in the studies in nuclear and atomic physics where the binding\nenergies are much smaller than the cutoffs on momenta. Hadronic structure is different\nbecause there are no free quarks or gluons; all high energy eigenstates involve bound states\nof quarks and gluons so it is not possible to remain above a bound-state threshold.\nWhen one proceeds to the case of a limit cycle with a geometric series of binding energies,\none must insure that the largest of them is small in comparison with desired values of \u03bb for\nthe generator with G = T to work.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe SRG offers an alternative to traditional renormalization group transformations which\ndiscard degrees of freedom and is being developed to attack problems where traditional\nmethods fail. These problems all involve a broad (in principle, considered infinite) range of\nmomentum scales that are strongly coupled and are typically not amenable to perturbation\ntheory, even if the latter is so-called renormalization-group improved. Analytic methods\nfail and direct numerical solutions are not possible because the space of states cannot be\ntruncated, due to the strong coupling, and the full space is too large for current or foreseeable\n23\n\n\fnumerical storage and manipulation. In the most interesting problems one cannot even\nbe sure what operators are needed to construct renormalizable Hamiltonians (e.g., what\ncounterterms are required in the presence of known bare interactions).\nWe have not illustrated the initial steps required to find renormalizable Hamiltonians,\nchoosing simple model problems in which the required operators are basically known (e.g.,\nsee [23]). But our calculations do illustrate methods that can make such initial steps feasible.\nFirst, as anticipated in Wilson's earliest work [24], we drastically truncate the space of states\nby moving from a continuum to a space of discrete states which are spaced exponentially,\nwith a tunable spacing governed by a parameter b. Going from a well-defined continuum\nproblem to a discretized problem is straightforward in the models we use, so we have paid\nlittle attention to this step; nor have we shown that with the renormalization problems we\nsolve the continuum can be recovered with exponential convergence by letting b \u2192 1. The\nrelevance of our calculations rests on the assumption that such a limit can be taken with\ncontrol of errors and without introducing new renormalization problems. Once we identify\n\nFIG. 3: The coupling constants gf (\u03bb) in the case of a limit cycle, plotted as a function of ln \u03bb/ ln b\nfor 6 values of f : f = 0 (Wegner), f = 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, and 1. The correspondence between\na curve and f is such that the curves for larger f reach higher and for f = 1 the corresponding\ncurve apparently shoots to infinity already around ln \u03bb/ ln b \u223c 15. The ultraviolet cutoff is at b16\nand b = 4, see [12].\n\n24\n\n\fthe operators required for renormalization with large b, using nonperturbative numerical\ncalculations like those shown here, we reach what is the starting point for the calculations\nwe present.\nAttempts to control the effects of strong coupling over large numbers of momentum scales\ntypically fail because divergences emerge. Originally, such divergences showed up in perturbation theory and gave rise to the whole renormalization program of the last century. Far\nmore challenging are the types of divergence illustrated by our calculations, divergences that\npersist if one attempts to go beyond perturbation theory using perturbative renormalization\nschemes such as standard methods for the renormalization of quantum electrodynamics.\nWilson's renormalization group improved perturbation theory avoids many of these problems in asymptotically free theories as long as cutoffs are kept sufficiently large. However, to\nsolve problems in which strong-coupling fixed points [3] or limit cycles exist, renormalization\ngroup transformations often must be crafted on a case by case basis. What the SRG offers is\na wealth of new transformations and in this paper we have focussed on some of the critical\nfeatures of these new transformations.\nThe existence of a critical value f = fc in SRG transformations with generators F {H} =\n[G, H] and G = f T + (1 \u2212 f )D, is demonstrated in discrete models with important features\nsuch as asymptotic freedom or a limit cycle. The case of SRG with f = 1, or G = T , is\nalways in the region f > fc . Therefore, when bound states exist and the SRG parameter\n\u221a\n\u03bb = 1/ s approaches the scale of momenta that dominate in the formation of bound states,\nthe strength of renormalized interactions grows. Numerical calculations of the interaction\nHamiltonians become increasingly difficult due to this growth. But if it is enough to calculate\neffective theories with \u03bb much larger than the scale of binding, the generator with f = 1 can\nbe employed without encountering an intractable increase of interaction strength.\nAs long as one stays away from the bound-state momentum scale, the numerical calculations in the generic models are equally powerful for f > fc as they are for f < fc . This\nresult shows that limits on applicability of the simplest version of the SRG transformation\nwith f = 1 due to bound states are not as severe as one might expect provided one keeps\n\u03bb away from the scale of binding. This is important because the SRG transformations with\nf = 1 are the simplest to implement in the continuum limit and in perturbative evaluation\nof the SRG flow of Hamiltonians.\nAt the same time, it is also made clear that in order to handle cases with a limit cycle,\n25\n\n\fone has to consider f < fc . This means that the generator must include interactions in\nG and cannot be limited to T . The f = 0 transformation advocated by Wegner [7, 8] is\nable to drive both of our models to diagonal form. We have not shown that this reproduces\nboth the correct binding energy and phase shifts for the continuum problem but such a\ndemonstration should be straightforward and is left for future work.\nFinally, it should be pointed out that this article does not resolve many important issues\nthat must be resolved to deal with confinement. These go well beyond dealing with bound\nstates and are not encountered in our simple generic models, but confinement presents us\nwith the problem of bound states at all cutoffs and at least in this respect the limit cycle\nmodel should provide important insights.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Scott Bogner and Dick Furnstahl for useful comments.
