The Greens function analysis is applied to characterize the input impedance of a concentric\nresonator excited by a dipole located at its center. The method of moments (MoM) with Galrekin's procedure is used\nto determine the current distribution over the source excitation and hence the input impedance. The behavior of quality\nfactor (Q) and bandwidths of the antenna is studied with the use of input impedance as a function of frequency. We\nillustrate that by embedding a dipole antenna inside a core-shell structure, with magnetic shell and dielectric core, a\nQ as low as the Chu limit can be approached. The obtained observations demonstrate how a resonator composed of\nmagnetic shells can provide electrically small antennas with high bandwidths performance.\nIndex Terms\nQuality factor, magnetic shell, concentric sphere, method of moments\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nAntennas with smaller physical size and wider bandwidths are desirable for mobile systems. In recent years,\nconsiderable efforts have been devoted towards antenna miniaturization. The main challenge is to reduce the resonant\nfrequency while maintaining other radiation features. According to Chu limit the ability of the antenna to radiate\neffectively depends on the total size of the antenna (k0 a with k0 being the wave number in the free space and a\nbeing the radius of the smallest sphere enclosing the antenna) [1]. To achieve an antenna with desired impedance\ncharacteristics, one can either design new topologies [2], [3] or use different substrates. [4], [5]. One of the most\nconventional methods for attaining desired miniaturization is to utilize high dielectric substrate, so that the size can\n\u221a\nbe scaled down by \u01ebr . However, due to the strong coupling between the high dielectric material and the ground\nplane, a large amount of energy is trapped inside the high permittivity substrate, and a hence good radiator cannot\nbe achieved. To reduce this coupling it has been suggested to use magneto-dielectric materials with moderate values\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n2\n\nof \u03bcr and \u01ebr [4], [5]. Note that the effect of the permeability is similar to adding some inductance to the input\nimpedance of the antenna. Thus, the antenna provides more radiation to the outside region leading to a wideband\nsmall antenna [4], [5]. Nevertheless it should be mentioned that achieving a low-loss weak-frequency-dispersive\nmagnetic material at the desired frequency is a major challenge.\nAnother approach for antenna miniaturization is to embed the antenna inside a negative permittivity (ENG)\nresonator. For instance, Stuart et al in [6] excited an ENG sphere with a dipole feed to produce the appropriate\npolarization required for the resonance performance. They demonstrated that one can achieve a very small antenna\nby operating the sphere around the frequency where \u01ebr = \u22122 region. Spherical geometry of the structure offers\nwide-band performance approaching the Chu limit. They showed that in this way Chu limit can be approached\nbut not exceeded [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. This will be very beneficial for the design of small-size antennas (the\nradius of sphere can be much smaller than the wavelength). Ziolkowski et al. have also demonstrated other novel\nsmall antennas designs utilizing combinations of ENG and MNG or Double Negative (DNG) metamaterials [11].\nSpherical geometry of the structure ensures the low-quality factor impedance performance.\nAs mentioned earlier, with the use of ENG , the quality factor around 1.5 times Chu limit can be achieved\n[6]. In this paper we propose a novel approach to achieve smaller Q (around 1.08QChu) with the use of magnetic\nmaterials. The idea is to combine both electric and magnetic effects by using a core-shell to reduce the absorbed\nenergy inside the resonator. It is worth mentioning that if the absorbed energy inside the resonator is negligible\ncompared to the stored energy outside the resonator, the operating Q would be around the Chu limit. To do that\nend, we embed the antenna inside a core-shell resonator where the thin shell is made of magnetic materials and\nthe core is filled with conventional dielectrics. We shows that in this scenario a quality factor around 1.08QChu\ncan be achieved.\nIn this paper, a rigorous treatment of a dipole fed a concentric spherical antenna is presented. In such a\nstructure, the energy first radiates from the dipole to the concentric resonator and then from the resonator to the\nfree space. To explore the behavior of small antennas embedded in multi-layer spheres, we utilize Green's function\nanalysis. The Green's functions for the evaluation of the input impedance are derived and the method of moment\n(MoM) with Galerkins procedure is used to determine the probe current from which the input impedance of the\nresonator is calculated. The desired Green's function is presented as sum of the Green's function associated with\nthe dipole and the Green's function associated with the scattering of the multi-layered sphere. For the dipole, the\ntraditional cylindrical Green's function is used and then expanded in term of spherical waves for matching the\nboundary conditions. By having the incident Green's function (the dipole Green's function) the Green's function\nassociated with the discontinuity of the concentric sphere can be achieved. The scattered coefficients are obtained\nby imposing the boundary conditions. To verify the accuracy of our technique, comparison between HFSS and\nMoM is applied leading to a very good agreement.\nWe then, explore the behavior of small antennas embedded inside a spherical core-shell through input impedance\nanalysis. The bandwidth performance of the antenna when embedded inside a spherical resonators is investigated.\nDifferent cases, including substrate with high dielectric, magneto-dielectric and magnetic are considered. For each\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n3\n\ncase, the quality factor is obtained and compared with the Chu limit. We illustrate that by designing an optimized\ncore-shell with magnetic shell and dielectric core quality factor as low as Chu limit can be attained. From practical\npoint of view, it is worth highlighting that although it is hard to obtain a high \u03bc material in GHz, it is relatively\neasy to achieve them when the thickness is thin.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In section II, the Green's functions for deriving resonance frequencies\nand input impedance of the antenna are obtained. In section III numerical results which verifies our theory for\nminiaturizing the antenna are presented and finally we conclude everything in the section IV.\nII. G REEN ' S F UNCTION A NALYSIS\nIn this section, we represent a rigorous analysis of electromagnetic waves radiation and scattering in the\npresence of a core-shell sphere. The required dyadic Greens functions are derived and expressed in the form of\nan infinite series of spherical eigen-modes. This series are convergent and hence can be truncated using a finite\nnumber of terms. Having the Green's function, we can simply find the electric field behavior and hence the input\nimpedance. The geometry of a dipole antenna inside a spherical core-shell is shown in Fig. 1. The inner and outer\nradii of the core-shell are a1 and a2 respectively. The material of the core has the permittivity of \u01eb1 and permeability\nof \u03bc1 , where the shell is described with \u01eb2 and \u03bc2 . The dipole of length 2l is located at the center of the core-shell.\nThe source is considered to be a delta gap at the center of the dipole.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nThe antenna configuration, a dipole antenna inside a spherical core-shell resonator\n\nThe goal is to obtain the input impedance, hence the z-directed electric field due to the z-direct current over the\ndipole should be calculated. The z-directed electric field due to the z-directed current element is determined by\nfirst expressing the z-directed current as r-directed current. The r-directed current can only generate T M r modes,\nsince only electric vector potential needs to be evaluated. As mentioned earlier, the desired Green's function is the\nsum of the Green's function associated with the dipole inside a homogenous medium of \u01ebr1 , \u03bcr1 and the Green's\nfunction due to the discontinuity of the core-shell. In this work we refer to the Green's function associated with the\ndiscontinuity of the sphere as the scattering Green's function. In order to achieve the scattering Green's function,\none has to first obtain the incident Green's function (due to the dipole inside a homogenous medium). In this work,\nwe first start with the electric vector potential Green's functions. Once the potential Greens functions are derived,\nthe various field components [12] and hence the input impedance as well as the radiation patterns can be evaluated.\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n4\n\nTo begin with we derived the solution for the r-directed Green's function due to the incident dipole. The incident\nGreen's function represent an infinitesimal source radiating in the unbounded medium of \u01ebr1 , \u03bcr1 . The solution for\nan r-directed electric source can be obtained by solving the following differential equation [12]:\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAi\n\u03b4\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u03b4\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\u03b4\nr\n\u2212\nr\nG\n\u0001\n\u22121\nJr \u2032\n\u22072 + k 2\n=\n.\nr\nr\nr2 sin \u03b8\n\n(1)\n\ni\nWhere GA\nJr\u2032 is the incident Green's function for the electric vector potential caused by an r-directed current.\n\n(2)\nJ\u02c6n (x) , \u0124n (x) are spherical Bessel and Hankel functions respectively and Pnm (x) is the associated Legendre\ni\nfunction. Therefore the r-directed Green's function GA\nJr\u2032 is:\n\n\u2032\n\ni\nGA\nJr\u2032 |r>r \u2032 = r\u0302\n\nn\nX\n2n + 1\nPn (cos \u03b6)J\u02c6n (k1 r\u2032 )\u0124n(2) (k1 r)\nn(n\n+\n1)\nn=0\n\n(2a)\n\ni\nGA\nJr\u2032 |r<r \u2032 = r\u0302\n\nn\nX\n2n + 1\nPn (cos \u03b6)J\u02c6n (k1 r\u2032 )J\u02c6n (k1 r)\nn(n\n+\n1)\nn=0\n\n(2b)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nIt is worth noticing that (r , \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) refers to source point while (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) refers to field point, and\ncos \u03b6 = cos\u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 + sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u2032 cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 )\n\n(3)\n\nFor an antenna at the center \u03b8\u2032 = 0 and hence cos \u03b6 = cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 .

Note\nthat, we assume a very thin dipole antenna, thus the structure is symmetric over the \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 . This means that\nin the expression of incident and scattering Green's function there is no dependence on \u03c6 or \u03c6\u2032 . By matching\nthe boundary conditions, which are the continuity of the electric and magnetic fields at a1 and a2 , the unknown\ncoefficients Cs1 , Cs2 , Cs3 and R23 (n) can be found.

To avoid this difficulty, we use the well known Green's function\nof a cylindrical dipole with the reduced kernel [12], [14].

It should be mentioned that when the reduced kernel is used together\nwith PWS modes, the accuracy as well as the convergence of Z matrix, for a moderately thick dipole can be\nimproved by using the two term equivalent radius as discussed in [14]. A computer program is developed to obtain\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n7\n\nthe current distribution and the input impedance. Once the input impedance is obtained, the quality factor can be\ncalculated as follows.\nBefore we start the antenna designs, let us validate the accuracy of our technique. The geometry of the structure\nis shown in Fig. 1, where a1 = 5.5mm and a2 = 7.5mm and l = 4.5mm. The material inside the core is a dielectric\nmaterial described with \u01ebr1 = 10 where the shell is a magnetic material (only permeability) with \u03bcr2 = 2. The\ninput impedance attained by MoM (Method of Moments) and HFSS is plotted in Fig. 2. A very good comparison\nis observed validating our MoM program.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nThe input resistance and reactance. The antenna composed of a dipole of length 2l = 9mm, located at the center of a spherical\n\ncore-shell resonator. Where a1 = 5.5 mm,a2 = 7.5 mm, \u01ebr1 = 10 and \u03bcr2 = 2.\n\nIt is worth noticing that the electric field inside the core is proportional to n(n+1)Pn (cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 )R12 J\u02c6n (k1 r\u2032 )J\u02c6n (k1 r).\nFor computation of the input impedance r and r\u2032 varies over the dipole, therefore | cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 | = 1 and r, r\u2032 < l\n\n. Thus, each term is basically proportional to n(n + 1)R12 J\u02c6n (k1 r\u2032 )J\u02c6n (k1 r) where r, r\u2032 < l. So let us introduce a\n\nnew term called 'scattering term' for better perception. The scattering term is defined as:\nST = n(n + 1)R12 J\u02c6n2 (k1 l)\n\n(19)\n\nFor a small antenna the resonant behavior arise from the discontinuity of the sphere rather than the dipole. So\ninvestigating a scattering term such as (19) in addition to the input impedance seems appropriate to provide a\nphysical insight of the electric field and resonant of the radiator.\nIn the next section we discuss the quality factor behaviors of different cases for dipole antenna embedded\ninside a spherical resonator. We illustrate that by using magnetic shell and dielectric core, the quality factor of the\nantenna can approach the Chu limit.\nIII. L OW-Q E LECTRICALLY S MALL A NTENNAS\nIn this section we discuss different methods of antenna miniaturization in microwave frequencies. As mentioned\nearlier, the simplest way to achieve antenna miniaturization is to use a high permittivity material. However, because\nof the strong concentration of electromagnetic fields inside the material, the performance of antenna is significantly\ndegraded which brings the narrow-band characteristic. Recently there have been some works to properly overcome\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n8\n\nthis problem by either printing the antenna on a magneto-dielectric substrate [5], or embedding the antenna inside\na magnetic material [5], [4]. Here, we apply the developed formulations to present a better physical insight of these\napproaches. Moreover, we illustrate a novel design for lowering the Q by embedding the antenna inside a spherical\ncore-shell where core is made of high dielectric and shell is made of magnetic materials.\nAs highlighted in [5], [4], by using a magneto-dielectric material one can deduce the capacitive behavior of\nthe high dielectric resonator. Basically, by choosing moderate values for \u01ebr and \u03bcr the same miniaturization factor\nas a high permittivity non-magnetic material can be achieved, while the capacitive property of the resonator is\nnow decreased by addition of some inductance behavior caused by \u03bcr . This will allow us to improve the antenna\nimpedance bandwidth. It has to be mentioned that in this case a higher input resistance is appeared since the\nimpedance is related to the ratio of \u03bcr /\u01ebr . By increasing the \u03bcr the input resistance goes higher and the resonance\noccurs at lower frequencies, hence the same miniaturization (as the high \u01ebr situation) is achieved even with smaller\npermeabilities. This shows that by embedding a dipole antenna inside a magnetic material lower quality factor can\nbe achieved however, the quality factor is still much higher than the QChu . Another approach to achieve a low Q\nantenna is to embed the antenna inside an ENG material which will also be illustrated in this paper.\nHere, we design a spherical core-shell, where the core is filled with high-dielectric materials and the shell is\nmade of large magnetics materials. We show that, if the shell is thin and filled with a material with a large \u03bcr ,\nthe field inside the core is negligible compared to the field of the dipole and the electric field inside the shell.\nThis can be interpreted as almost zero absorbed energy inside the core. Also, since the shell is thin the absorbed\nenergy inside the shell is small compared to the energy absorbed outside the resonator. Thereafter, one can expect\nto achieve a quality factor close to Chu limit. Before we begin, let us first take a look at the quality factor.\nAssume that, the antenna is tuned at a frequency \u03c90 with a series reactance Xs (\u03c9). Thus, the total reactance\nis zero at \u03c90 . if the input impedance of the tuned antenna is Z0 (\u03c9), where the input impedance of the antenna is\nZ(\u03c9) we have:\nX0 (\u03c90 ) = X(\u03c90 ) + Xs (\u03c90 ) = 0\n\n(20a)\n\nZ0 (\u03c9) = Z(\u03c9) + jXs (\u03c9) = R0 (\u03c9) + jX0 (\u03c9)\n\n(20b)\n\nWhere R0 and X0 are the resistance and reactance of the tuned antenna respectively. If the antenna is matched to\nR0 (\u03c90 ), the reflection would be zero at \u03c90 provided that the tuning inductance or capacitance is lossless. For a\ntuned antenna at \u03c9 = \u03c90 the matched VSWR bandwidth can be well-defined for all frequencies. The bandwidth\n\u2206\u03c9 is defined as the difference between the two frequencies on other side of \u03c90 at which the reflection equals to\na constant number \u03b1, with \u03b1 < 1/2. If |\u2206\u03c9/\u03c90 | \u226a 1, the solution for bandwidth is obtained as [15]:\nr\n\u03b1\nR0 (\u03c90 )\n\u2206\u03c9 = 2\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 Z \u2032 (\u03c90 )\n|R0 (\u03c9\u00b1 ) \u2212 R0 (\u03c90 )|2 + |X0 (\u03c9\u00b1 )|2\n\u03b1=\n|R0 (\u03c9\u00b1 ) + R0 (\u03c90 )|2 + |X0 (\u03c9\u00b1 )|2\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nIt is renowned that the quality factor is inversely proportional to the bandwidths. Hence the larger the bandwidths\nthe smaller the quality factor and vice versa. To verify this theory, let us obtain the quality factor. Yaghjian and\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n9\n\nBest shown that the quality factor for an antenna tuned to zero reactance at omega = \u03c90 can be defined as [15]:\nQ(\u03c90 ) =\n\n\u03c90\n2\u03c90\nX \u2032 (\u03c90 ) \u2212\n[WL (\u03c90 ) + WR (\u03c90 )]\n2R0 (\u03c90 ) 0\n|I0 |2 R0 (\u03c90 )\n\n(23)\n\nwhere WL (\u03c90 ) + WR (\u03c90 ) is the total dispersion energy. Using the RLC circuit realization, the quality factor can\nbe well approximated by [15]:\nQ(\u03c90 ) \u2248\n\n\u03c90\n|Z \u2032 (\u03c90 )|\n2R0 (\u03c90 ) 0\n\n(24)\n\nAccording to the above equation, the quality factor is directly related to the input impedance and inversely\nproportional to Bandwidths. This means that by having the input impedance of any antenna we can easily obtain\nthe Q.\nAs discussed earlier to achieve the desired miniaturization, the simplest way is to use high-dielectric material.\nThe objective it to have a wide-band antenna working around 2GHz. We embed a dipole antenna at the center\nof a dielectric sphere filled with a high dielectric material . The spherical radiator has a radius of a1 = 7.5 mm\nand is filled with dielectric material with \u01ebr1 = 100. It is worth mentioning that, a spherical resonator is basically\na core-shell where the material of the shell is free space. The scattering terms (for the first three modes) and\ninput impedance are shown in Fig. 3. As is shown, the first scattering term behavior exhibits a resonance around\n2.8GHz, so we expect to have a resonance in the input impedance around this region. The input impedance shows\nthe resonance performance around 2.3GHz. The return loss for the tuned antenna is plotted in Fig. 4(a), revealing\na narrow-band resonance at f = 2.32 GHz. For this resonance, the quality factor of the tuned antenna calculated\nby using (24) is Q = 293.1, whereas the Chu limit is Qchu =\n\n1\nka3\n\n1\n= 23.69. The obtained Q from the antenna\n+ ka\n\nis more than 12 times the Chu limit which was expected from the return loss behavior.\n300\n2000\nInput Impedance\n\nScattering Terms\n\n250\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\n\n200\n150\n100\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n(a)\nFig. 3.\n\nResistance\nReactance\n\n0\n\u22121000\n\u22122000\n\n50\n0\n2\n\n1000\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n\u22123000\n1.5\n\n2\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.5\n\n(b)\n\n(a) Scattering term for the first three modes.

To verify this theory, instead of embedding the antenna inside a high-dielectric material, one can utilize\nmagneto-dielectric materials. Fig. 5 demonstrates the scattering terms and the input impedance for such an antenna\nembedded inside a magneto-dielectric material (\u01ebr = 12, \u03bcr = 8). Notice that, the first scattering term, of particular\ninterest, shows a resonance performance with a higher bandwidths compared with the one depicted in Fig. 3(a). The\nreturn loss is shown in Fig. 6 exhibiting a resonant around f = 2.19 GHz. Clearly the bandwidths has increased,\nmeaning the quality factor should be reduced. From (24), quality factor is equal to Q = 101.3 which is 3.64 times\nthe Qchu = 27.82. This result verifies that by adding magnetic material Q has decreased while bandwidths has\nincreased.\n4\n\nx 10\n\n50\n2.5\n2\nInput Impedance\n\nScattering Terms\n\n40\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2\n\nResistance\nReactance\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n(a)\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n\u22121\n1.5\n\n2\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.5\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 5.

The scattering terms\nshow a significant increase in the bandwidths of the resonance hence, we expect to have a higher bandwidths and\nlower Q for the antenna. Also, note that the scattering coefficient in the shell is the same as the scattering coefficient\ninside a sphere of radius 7.5 mm filled with \u03bcr = 90. As is evident form Fig. 10(a) and (b), the scattering terms\ninside the shell is much stronger than the ones in the core. Hence, it is anticipated that the field inside the shell to\nbe large. Nevertheless, the shell is thin and the total energy stored inside the resonator is still small compared to\nstored energy outside. The return loss is shown in Fig. 11 exhibiting a resonant around f = 2.36 GHz. Clearly\nthe bandwidths is increased remarkably, meaning the quality factor should be reduced. From (24), quality factor is\nequal to Q = 34.97 = 1.56QChu. This is an interesting results, exhibiting that by surrounding the antenna with a\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n13\n\nmagnetic shell the quality factor can be reduced. By optimizing the structure reduced Q can be obtained as will\ndiscuss later.\n70\n\n5\n\nScattering Terms\n\nScattering Coefficient\n\n60\n4\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.8\n\n0\n2\n\n3\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n(a)\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\nResistance\nReactance\n\nInput Impedance\n\n200\n\n0\n\n\u2212200\n\n\u2212400\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n(c)\nFig. 10.\n\n(a) Scattering terms for the first three modes, (b) Scattering terms inside the shell for the first three modes and, (c) The input\n\nresistance and reactance.

Thus, let us first investigate the behavior of the scattering term with changing the material of the core.\nAccording to Figs. 12, if the dielectric material of the cores increases the bandwidths of the scattering term\nincreases. However, from Fig. 12(b) it can be seen that the scattering terms does not varies when the dielectric\nmaterial of the core is sufficiently large (in this case around \u01ebr1 = 60). Considering the scattering terms in Figs. 12\nwe can optimize a design to achieve a quality factor closer to QChu and a resonant around 2 GHz. Fig. 13\ndemonstrates the scattering terms and the input impedance for a dipole of length 2l = 9 mm embedded inside a\ncore-shell. The inner and outer radii of the core are a1 = 6.5 mm and a2 = 7.5 mm. The core is filled with a\ndielectric with permittivity of \u01ebr1 = 60, while the shell is a magnetic material of \u03bcr2 = 90. The scattering term\nshows a significant increase in the bandwidths of the resonance. Hence, we expect a higher bandwidths and lower\nQ for the antenna. To check the accuracy of our method, we compare the input impedance vs frequency with\nthe use of MoM and commercially available software HFSS.

The quality factor obtained from (24), is Q = 31.07 = 1.08QChu. The achieved results exhibit a\nbandwidth performance so close to Chu limit.\nTo have a clear understanding of the performance the electric field inside the resonator is plotted in Fig. 14(b).\nThe near field reveals that the magnitude of electric field inside the core is negligible (around 70 dB less) compared\nto the field inside the shell and the dipole. This means we can ignore the stored energy inside the core. Moreover,\nsince the shell is thin, the stored energy inside the shell is small and a quality factor close to Chu can be obtained. It\nis worth highlighting that since the materials inside the resonator are lossless, in calculation of Q, the loss energy is\nzero. Further, the magnetic shell can be envisioned as a magnetic current, which creates a kind of loop performance\nfor the surface current and cancels the the electric current of the dipole. The magnitude of the surface current is\nplotted in Fig. 15. As can be seen the magnitude of the current is maximum around \u03b8 = 90o which shows the\nsort of loop performance (magnetic current) for the current. The results verifies that if we have a design where the\nabsorbed energy inside the sphere surrounding the antenna, a wide-band performance associated with a Q close\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION\n\n15\n\nScattering Coefficient\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n2.6\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n(a)\n15\n\n30\n25\nInput Impedance\n\nInput Impedance\n\nHFSS\nMoM\n10\n\n5\n\nHFSS\nMoM\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\n2.3\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n\u22125\n2\n\n2.1\n\n(b)\nFig. 13.\n\n2.2\n2.3\nFrequency(GHz)\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n(c)\n\n(a) Scattering term for the first three modes.

Also as mentioned it is\nhard to obtain a high \u03bc bulk material in GHz but for thin shell it is possible to achieve a high \u03bc material.s\nIV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate the behaviors of small resonators composed embedded in layered spherical resonators\nby obtaining the Greens functions for the electric field. We present a novel approach for achieving the desired\nminiaturization while maintains the low Q performance, by embedding the dipole antenna inside a core-shell with\nmagnetic shells. The quality factor and input impedance of the antenna is investigated through the method of\nmoment with Galerkins procedure. We illustrate that by proper choosing of the materials, quality factor as low as\n1.08 times the Chu limit can be achieved.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] L. J. Chu.
