Such growth makes more thorough and rigorous analysis of the\nnature of Internet traffic and topology an urgent task. It is also a very difficult one. It\nwas ever believed that the mathematical theories for circuit switching telephone networks\nmight be good enough for analyzing the Internet traffic and topology. However, later it\nwas found that the Internet, as a package switching network, has very different nature\nand successful mathematical theories for the Internet can be quite different from those for\ntelephone networks(see Willinger and Paxson(1998) for more details).\nAs the Internet grows at an astonishing speed, more and more high quality data have\nbeen collected in recent years. These data make thorough studies possible. The pioneering\nwork by Leland et al. (1994) shows that the traffic of Local Area Network(LAN) appears to\nbe self-similar at different scales. Discoveries of other self-similarities such as the one found\nin Wide Area Network(WAN) by Paxson and Floyd(1995) make Internet engineers and\ninterested mathematicians contemplate that some special power laws such as the heavy tail\ndistribution might be the hidden rules in Internet traffic(see Willinger and Paxson(1998) or\nWillinger, Paxson and Taqqu(1998)).\nThe discovery of three Power Laws by Faloutsos, Faloutsos and Faloutsos(1999) is one\nof the most recent work on the Internet topology. They view the Internet as an undirected\ngraph. For each node in the graph, it has properties such as the out-degree. Faloutsos'\ndiscovery is not just power laws for the large scale properties of the Internet, but rather the\nrelationships between nodes at different scales, running from a host on a LAN to the range\nencompassed by the whole Internet. Without a doubt, such discovery is important not only\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nto our understanding of the very nature of the rapidly growing Internet, but also to any\nreasonable simulations of LANs or WANs or the whole Internet.\nYet, as we will point out in section 2 of this note, the first two Power Laws in Faloutsos'\ndiscovery are not independent to each other. In fact, they are equivalent so each one can be\nderived from the other. In section 3, we will go further to show that the data analysis in\nFaloutsos' work toward discovering Power Law 1 is superior to the data analysis work done\nfor Power Law 2, simply because the former data analysis will give more accurate estimate\ncomparing to the later one. Conclusions are summarized in the last section, section 4.\n\n2.\n\nEquivalence Between the first and the second Faloutsos' Power Laws\n\nThroughout this note, we adopt the notations used in Faloutsos' work. The Internet\nis viewed as an undirected graph G, and the number of nodes and the number of edges in\nG are N and E, respectively. The out-degree of a node v, which is the number of edges\nincident to the node, is denoted by dv . Note that in G, different nodes may have the same\nout-degree. That is, if we can group all the nodes which have the same out-degree d and\nindex the group, then for the nodes in the lth group, they have the same out-degree denoted\nby dl. The number of nodes in this lth group, which gives the frequency of appearances of\nout-degree dl in G, is denoted by fdl . Sometimes we just write fd to denote the frequency of\nd in G. This is because the out-degree d, which always starts from 1 throughout this note,\ncan be used to index the groups of nodes of different out-degrees, thus fd is the number of\nnodes in the dth group for out-degree d. The rank, rv , of a node v which has an out-degree d\nis the global index of the node among all of the nodes in the order of decreasing out-degree.\nThe first and second Faloutsos' Power Laws can be stated as\ndv = C1 rvR\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand\nfd = C2 dO\n\n(2)\n\nrespectively. Here C1 is a constant and can be determined by any given pair of dv and\nrv measured from data collected from the Internet. C2 is another constant and can be\ncalculated from a pair of fd and d. R and O are the two exponents of the Power Laws.\nBy definition, the frequency of out-degree d in G, fd , is related to the ranks of those\nnodes which have out-degree d. Suppose node vd\u22121 is a node of out-degree d \u2212 1, and\nit is the last indexed node with rank rv\u2032 in the group consisting of nodes which all have\nout-degree d \u2212 1. Further suppose that node vd is a node of out-degree d, and it is the last\nindexed node, with rank rv , in the group consisting of nodes of out-degree d. Then fd is\nrelated to rv\u2032 and rv through the relation\nfd = rv\u2032 \u2212 rv .\n\n(3)\n\nWe may re-write relation (1) as\n1\nrv =\nC1\n\u0012\n\n\u00131\n\n1\n\nR\n\n(4)\n\ndvR .\n\nNote that the first order approximation to the right hand side of (3) is in fact the first order\nderivative of the right hand side of (4) with respect to d:\nfd =\n\nrv\u2032\n\n1 1\n\u2212 rv \u2248 \u2212\nR C1\n\u0012\n\n\u00131\n\nR\n\n1\n\nd R \u22121\n\n(5)\n\nFrom (4) to (5) we changed dv to d because for all nodes of the group where node vd is in,\nthey all have the same out-degree d. Comparing (5) and (2), we have\nO\u2248\n\n1\n\u22121\nR\n\n(6)\n\nand\n1 1\nC2 \u2248 \u2212\nR C1\n\u0012\n\n\u00131\n\nR\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThus we have derived the second Power Law from the first Power Law. To derive the first\nPower Law from the second, we have to integrate relation (2) from 1 to dv to get rv , then\ncompare the result with relation (4). By doing this, we have\nR\u2248\n\n1\nO+1\n\n(8)\n\nand\nC1 \u2248\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212O \u2212 1\nC2\n\n\u0013R\n\n(9)\n\n.\n\n(6), (7) and (8), (9) shows that whenever we have one of the two Power Laws, exponent\nand the constant of the other one can be derived from the given parameters. That is, in\ndata analysis of the Internet topology, once we have measured rv at different out-degrees\nand found a power law relation with exponent R between them, we do not need to measure\nfd at different out-degrees because the power law relation between rv and out-degree\nwill guarantee the power law relation between fd and d with an exponent O \u2248\n\n1\nR\n\n\u2212 1.\n\nIn simulations, samples generated according to Power Law 1 will follow Power Law 2\nautomatically, and vice versa.\nIn Table 1 and Table 2, we list the comparisons of the derived parameters using above\nrelations and the measured parameters given in the work of Faloutsos'. From table 1 we find\nour calculated exponent O of Power Law 2 is quite close to the measured one, except the\nlast case, which is the Rout-95 dataset. The small discrepancy shows that mere coincidence\nis not likely. For the comparison of our calculated exponent R and the measured R in table\n2, although the relative errors are larger than those in table 1, for the first three cases they\nare still below 15%.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nBetter Way to Estimate Exponent\n\nWhen deriving relations (6) and (8) in above section, we assumed first that one of the\nPower Laws must hold. In the derivation, we used differentiation and integration, which can\nonly be approximately correct because the real datasets are discrete samples. Suppose at\none sampling position, such as an out-degree d, the measured rank is rv , and our calculated\nrank by integrating equation (2) is r\u0302v . We denote the difference between rv and r\u0302v by \u01eb,\nand call it an error term for the estimation of rank at out-degree d. We can define a similar\nerror term, \u03b7, for the estimation of frequency at out-degree d with equation (5). The errors,\nboth \u01eb and \u03b7, can be the measurement errors, the round-off errors, or the errors due to the\ndiscrete nature of our sampling, and in most cases, the combination of them all.\nNon-zero \u01eb will affect our estimation of O made in table (1). Non-zero \u03b7 will also affect\nour estimation of R in table (2), but in a different way from how \u01eb affects estimating O. We\nfind that the relative errors for the first three cases in table (1) are smaller than those in\ntable (2). In other words, the derivation of O from R by differentiating equation (4) gives\ncloser to measured results than the derivation of R from O by integrating equation (2).\nThis is because that if rank rv has error \u01eb, then from equation (3) the error in fd will be of\nthe order \u223c O(\u01eb). However, if fd has error \u03b7, then the error in rv , which can be obtained\nby integrating equation (2), is in fact an accumulation of \u03b7 in the summation, which is\n\u223c O(n\u03b7) where n is the number of out-degrees used in the integration. Hence, even though\nthe two Power Laws are equivalent, deriving the second Power Law from the first one will\ngive better estimate, i.e., estimate with smaller errors if \u01eb \u223c \u03b7, of the second Power Law\nthan the estimate of the first Power Law derived from the second one.\nIn Faloutsos' work, they applied linear regression to obtain the Power Laws. We have\nshown above that Power Laws 1 and 2 are equivalent, therefore the two linear regressions\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\napplied in Faloutsos' work should give the same answer. That is, if we start from a Power\nLaw relation between rank r and out-degree d, for example, d = C1 r R , and deduce the\nrelation between frequency fd and d, the relation should also be a power law. for example,\nfd = C2 dO , and the exponent O should be related to R through (6). In Figure 1, the \u22c6's\nshow the relation\nd = C1 r \u22121.0 .\n\n(10)\n\nNote the logarithmic scales on both axes. There are 2000 data generated, so the rank r\nruns from 1 to 2000. The heavy solid line is the linear fitting to the \u22c6's, with slope \u22120.85,\ninstead of \u22121 as we expect. This is due to the discretization of the data. The \u22c6's with\nout-degree d > 1 have a linear fitting of slope \u22120.97, which is shown in Figure 1 as the dash\nline. Apparently the data of out-degree 1 have large effect on the linear fitting.\nIn Figure 2, we plot the relation between fd and d based on the data(\u22c6's) collected in\nFigure 1. A few data of frequency 1 and out-degree d > 33 are outliers and discarded in\nthe fitting made in Figure 2, which is shown as a heavy solid line. The number of these\ndiscarded outliers is 26, only 1.3% of the total data. The slope of the linear fitting is \u22122.01,\nwhich is what we expect because of the equivalence of the two Power Laws, i.e., equation\n(6).\n\n4.\n\nDiscussions and Conclusions\n\nGiven the definitions of frequency fd and rank r, it is not surprising to see the\nequivalence of the first two Power Laws proposed by Faloutsos et al. We have proved such\nequivalence and demonstrated the mutual determination of these two relations, therefore\nit is not possible nor necessary for any simulations to follow these two power relations\nindependently. However, as we have shown in section 3, determining the power relation\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nbetween frequency fd and out-degree d by analyzing the data of rank rv as a function\nof our-degree d, will give estimates of smaller error comparing to the estimate made in\nreversed order, i.e., the estimate of the power law relation between rank r and out-degree\nd by analyzing the data of frequency fd as a function of out-degree d. For any set of\ndata measured from the Internet, they will follow the power law only approximately, not\nalways exactly, especially the nodes of very high out-degree and frequency 1, or the nodes\nof out-degree 1, as we show in Figures (1) and (2). In simulations, these nodes should be\ntreated with special care.\nIf the probability density function for the appearance of nodes with out-degree s in the\nInternet is \u03c1(s), then the average number of nodes whose out-degrees run from d1 to d2 is\nZ\n\nd2\n\ns\u03c1(s)ds,\n\n(11)\n\nd1\n\nwith which we can deduce the relation between frequency fd at out-degree d and the\nprobability density function \u03c1(s) as\nfd \u2248\n\nZ\n\nd+\u2206d\n\ns\u03c1(s)ds \u2248 \u03c1(d)d,\n\nd\u2212\u2206d\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we assume 2\u2206d = 1. If fd = C2 dO , we have the probability density function \u03c1(d) as\n\u03c1(s) \u2248 C2 dO\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is a heavy tail distribution. The rank r is related to the function \u03c1(d) through the\nintegration\nr(d) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\n\ns\u03c1(s)ds\n\n(14)\n\nfor d > 1.\nThe Power Laws show the relations between nodes of different out-degrees when the\nInternet is in steady state. In order to study the dynamics of the Internet, it would be very\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ninteresting to inject nodes of some specific out-degrees into the Internet, and follow the\ntemporal evolution of these nodes. By the time we inject nodes of some specific out-degree,\nwe alter the power law relationship between fd and d by adding a spike-like disturbance(see\nFigure 3). If a steady Internet does follow power laws, tracing the evolution of the spike-like\ndisturbance will tell us how the disturbance will be propagated, or cascaded, toward higher\nout-degree and lower out-degree directions(shown by the two arrows in Figure 3), the spike\nbeing broadened at the same time(shown by the dash line in Figure 3). In real life, such\nspike-like disturbance could be due to the sharp increase in the number of Internet users\nsigning onto their ISPs. Studies on the dynamic evolution of the Internet due to such\nspike-like disturbances will be included in our future work.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
