This resulted\nin a significant improvement in the study of atom-surface interactions and\nprovided reliable and reproducible information about the behavior of the\natomic clouds trapped at different heights above the chip surface [1]-[7]. In\nmagnetic traps close to the surface of the chip, atoms experience magnetic\nfluctuations which enhance harmful effects such as spin-flip induced trap loss,\nheating and decoherence. Good agreement was found between experimental\nmeasurements of these effects and their theoretical predictions presented in\nreferences [8]-[14]. A complete theoretical treatment of magnetic fluctuations\nclose to metallic surface is based on summing the contribution of thermally\noccupied modes of the electromagnetic field in the presence of the metallic\nsurface. This approach provides a manageable calculation of the magnetic\nfluctuations close to an infinite planar surface [8]-[11]. A different approach\n(the quasi-static approximation) assumes that at low transition frequencies,\nmagnetic fluctuations are instantaneously generated by thermal electric current fluctuations in the metal [12]. This approach is not restricted to planar\nsurfaces and is therefore suitable for calculating magnetic noise on an atom\nchip with complex structures. Both theoretical approaches predict the same\ndependence of the magnetic noise on the temperature and resistivity of the\nmetal chip elements in the limit of a large penetration depth (low transition\nfrequencies), although some differences occur in the dependence on the chip\ngeometry. For a detailed review of the relevant equations, see the paper by\nC. Henkel in this Special Issue [15].\nAtom chip surfaces have to meet stringent requirements and are conventionally made of copper and gold. Both metals are convenient in view of\ntheir ability to hold high current densities and in view of available technology (ease of evaporation, electroplating, and etching), gold being somewhat\npreferable due to its high resistance to corrosion. Furthermore, it appeared\nto be common wisdom that as the surface induced noise was a function of\nthe ratio T /\u03c1 (quasi-static approximation) between the surface temperature\nand its resistivity, there is no point in cooling the surface, since \u03c1 usually\nscales linearly with temperature.\nIn this work, we discuss the possibility of minimizing the surface induced\nnoise by a proper choice of the materials and their temperature. As an example, we discuss several materials (normal metals or alloys) and convenient\ntemperature regimes in which one may achieve both minimal resistivity and\nminimal magnetic noise. Experimental data suggesting that this is indeed\npossible is provided by the large difference in the scattering rates observed\n2\n\n\ffor atom clouds trapped near different metal surfaces [4].\n\n2\n\nMaterial dependence of magnetic noise\n\nOur analysis is based on the theory of loss and heating for magnetically\ntrapped atoms near metallic surfaces developed in [11] and [12]. Magnetic\ntrapping of neutral atoms is limited by transitions into untrapped Zeeman\nlevels. The transition rate \u03930\u2192f from the trapped state |0i into an untrapped\nstate |f i is proportional to the magnetic field fluctuations in the following\nway [11]:\nX h0|\u03bci |f ihf |\u03bcj |0i ij\n\u03930\u2192f =\nSB (\u03c9f 0 )\n(1)\nh\u03042\ni,j\nwhere \u03bci and \u03bcj (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are the projections of the atomic magnetic\nmoment on the main axes and SBij (\u03c9f 0 ) is the spectral density of the magnetic\nnoise at the transition frequency \u03c9f 0 (for spin-flip transitions, \u03c9f 0 is the\nLarmor frequency of the atomic spin in the center of the trap). The spectral\ndensity SBij is related to the two-point correlation function of the magnetic\nfield fluctuations:\nhBi\u2217 (x, \u03c9)Bj (x, \u03c9 \u2032 )i = 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )SBij (x, \u03c9)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x is the location of the trap center. Typically, one is in the stationary\nlimit of very low transition frequencies, where the wavelength of the radiated\nfield is much larger than the dimensions of the system and the penetration\ndepth of the electromagnetic field into the metal is much larger than the\nthickness of the metal structures. The spectral density of the magnetic noise\nis described in this regime by the simple product of a factor, which is materialdependent, and a geometrical tensor Yij [12]:\nSBij (x, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03bc20 kB T\nYij (x)\n4\u03c0 2 \u03c1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzman constant, \u03bc0 is the vacuum permeability, T is the\ntemperature of the metal, and \u03c1 its static resistivity. The geometrical tensor\nYij (x) at the trap center is given by (note that the factor 1/2 is erroneously\nmissing in Eq.(A.6) of Ref. [12]):\n\n3\n\n\fYij = tr{Xij }\u03b4ij \u2212 Xij\nZ\n1\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )i (x \u2212 x\u2032 )j\nXij =\nd3 x\u2032\n2\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )6\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the integration is done over the volume of the metal element.\nThe spectral density of the magnetic noise in Eq. (3) is actually independent of the transition frequency and gives rise to a scattering rate which is\nproportional to the ratio T /\u03c1. This result\nq of the quasi-static approximation\nis valid whenever the skin depth \u03b4 = 2\u03c1/\u03bc0 \u03c9f 0 is much larger than both\nthe distance d of the trap from the metal structure and the thickness t of the\nmetal structure elements.\nIn the opposite limit, when \u03b4 is very small, e.g. as the resistance drops\nupon cooling, the penetration depth is reduced according to \u03b4 \u221d \u03c11/2 , and\nthe scaling laws with \u03c1 and distance change. For example, above a metallic\nhalf-space, the quasi-static approximation (d \u226a \u03b4) results in a scaling of\nT /(\u03c1d) [8, 9, 12] while for d \u226b \u03b4 one finds a scaling of T \u03c11/2 /d4 [10, 11] (see\nalso a discussion in [15, 16]).\nAn expression for the magnetic noise in the intermediate range where\nthe skin depth is comparable to the thickness or the distance, exists only\nfor planar (possibly layered) structures in the form of interpolation formulas\n[8, 10] or integrals to be computed numerically (see a review in Ref. [15]\nand recent work in Refs. [16, 17]). For an infinitely thick metallic layer,\n\u22121\nRef. [11] suggests an interpolation factor of (1 + 2d3 /3\u03b4 3 ) which should\nmultiply the expression in Eq. (3). This factor was shown experimentally\nto give the right trends, but is not very accurate at intermediate distances\nd \u223c \u03b4, where the integral expression gives a much better agreement with\nexperiment [4]. Its important to note that in the regime of a short skin\ndepth, d > \u03b4, the magnetic noise power is actually reduced compared to the\nscaling law T /\u03c1. More specifically, the large-distance scaling of T \u03c11/2 now\nimplies a strong noise reduction upon cooling. In this work, we will mainly\ndeal with the regime where the factor T /\u03c1 holds. However, when describing\nour conclusions for this regime, we will also define its validity borders and\naddress the consequences of entering the short skin depth regime.\nTaking gold at room temperature as our standard (and using similar\n\n4\n\n\fnotation as in [12]), we may write a simplified expression for \u0393:\n\u0393 \u2248 57s\u22121\n\n(T /300K) X \u03bci \u03bcj\n(Yij \u00d7 1\u03bcm)\n(\u03c1/\u03c1Au,300K ) ij \u03bc2B\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, \u03c1Au,300K is the resistivity of gold at room\ntemperature and \u03bci , \u03bcj are matrix elements of the atomic magnetic moment\nbetween relevant states. To avoid complications of magnetic permeability and\nhysteresis of the chip, we consider here only nonmagnetic metals (having no\nlong-range magnetic order). The resistivity of these metals is essentially a\nsum of two contributions \u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03c1ph : a temperature independent residual\nresistivity \u03c10 , due to scattering of charge carriers by crystal defects and impurities and a phonon contribution \u03c1ph , which can be described in the well\nknown Bloch-Gruneisen approximation as [18]:\n\u03c1ph\n\nT\n=A\n\u0398\n\u0012\n\n\u00135 Z\n\n0\n\n\u0398/T\n\nz 5 ez\ndz\n(ez \u2212 1)2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere A is constant and \u0398 = h\u0304\u03c9ph /kB is the Debye temperature, \u03c9ph being\nthe phonon cutoff frequency. The asymptotic temperature dependence of the\nphonon resistivity at very low temperatures (T \u226a \u0398) is given by \u03c1ph \u223c T 5 ,\nwhile it becomes linear \u03c1ph \u223c T at high temperatures (T \u226b \u0398). One can\nthen identify three regimes for the behavior of the ratio T /\u03c1 that provides\nupper limits for the magnetic noise, as mentioned above:\n(i) at low temperatures the metal resistivity is dominated by the temperature independent residual resistivity \u03c10 and T /\u03c1 will decrease linearly\nwhen reducing the temperature.\n(ii) in an intermediate regime where the phonon resistivity dominates, such\nthat \u03c1 \u226b \u03c10 , but the temperature is less than the Debye temperature \u0398\nor comparable to it, the resistivity grows nonlinearly with temperature\n(\u03c1ph \u223c T \u03b1 , with \u03b1 > 1) and T /\u03c1 increases with reducing temperature.\n(iii) at high temperatures the resistivity becomes linear in T and T /\u03c1 will\nbe temperature independent.\nFor real conductors the residual resistance ratio \u033a \u2261 \u03c1(300K)/\u03c10 (used as\na quality parameter) has a wide variation due to its dependence on the purity\n\n5\n\n\flevel, as well as the thermal and mechanical treatment of the metal. Conducting elements on an atom chip are usually fabricated as a film and thereby\nmay have significant residual resistivity relative to bulk metals. Lattice and\nsurface disorder in metal films, which is mainly due to grain structure and\ngas absorption, results in the increase of \u03c10 [19].\nFor the comparison of the magnetic noise produced by different materials\nwe need not specify the geometry of the conductor, which is all contained in\nthe tensor Yij . In accordance with Eq. (5), we can formulate the optimization\ncriteria as the following: the material used for the chip wires should have both\nthe resistivity and the ratio T /\u03c1 smaller than the gold standard at T =300\nK, in a convenient temperature interval.\n\n3\n\nPure metals\n\nPure metals usually have high values of \u033a, such that for 10 K < T < 300 K,\ntheir behavior follows that of the intermediate regime defined above, where\nthe magnetic noise increases with cooling. This situation is illustrated in\nFig. 1, where the normalized magnetic noise of copper, silver, gold and niobium is presented as a function of temperature. The values are normalized to\nthe magnetic noise level for gold at T =300 K. Respective resistivity behavior\nis shown in the inset. The data for the ideal (phonon) resistivity of the metals\nwere extracted from [20]. We assume \u03c10 to be 1% of the room temperature\nresistivity (such values are realistic for high quality films of 2-3\u03bcm thickness\n[21, 22]). One should note that the latter number is highly sensitive to the\ndetails of the fabrication process, including material purity, film thickness,\ngranular structure and surface specularity. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the\nmagnetic noise from the studied noble metals is not reduced by cooling but\nrather exhibits a pronounced peak in the temperature range 20-50 K.\nAs mentioned above in the discussion following Eq. (3) and (4), we need\nto define the validity borders of the T /\u03c1 approximation. As an example, we\nconsider a trap with a spin-flip transition frequency \u03c9f 0 \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.79MHz\n(B0 =0.57G) near a copper-made conductor, as in the experiment described\nin Ref. [5]. The skin depth for copper with \u033a=100 is \u03b4 = 74\u03bcm at room temperature (\u03c1 = 1.7\u03bc\u03a9*cm), \u03b4 = 25.3\u03bcm at liquid nitrogen temperature (\u03c1 =\n0.2\u03bc\u03a9*cm) and \u03b4 = 7.4\u03bcm at liquid helium temperature (\u03c1 = 0.017\u03bc\u03a9*cm).\nFollowing the explanation given above, our analysis of pure metals at low\ntemperatures will be restricted to trap distances from the surface of less\n6\n\n\fthan \u03b4, namely, less than 7\u03bcm at liquid helium temperatures. Some corrections will be needed for distances close to 7\u03bcm and a separate treatment will\nbe needed for longer distances. For higher temperatures, or for alloys with\nhigher resistivity as in the next section, or for lower transition frequencies\nsuch as transitions between motional levels in magnetic traps (heating), the\nfollowing analysis will be valid for distances of at least several tens of microns.\n\nOhm cm)\n\n10\n\nCu\n\nResistivity (10\n\n(T/300 K)/( /\n\nAu,300K\n\n)\n\n-6\n\n8\n\n6\n\nAg\n4\n\n10\n\nNb\n\n1\n\nAu\n\nAg\n\n0.1\n\nCu\n\n100\n\n2\n\n200\n\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nAu\n\nNb\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFigure 1: Temperature dependence of the normalized magnetic noise calculated using Eq.

Inset: temperature dependence of the resistivity (extracted from [20]).\nIn order to broaden the search we have performed the magnetic noise\ncalculation for 14 metals having no magnetic ordering: Al, W, Au, Ir, Cu,\nMo, Nb, Pt, Rh, Ag, Ta, Ti, Zn, Zr. The resistivity data for the metals were\nextracted from [20]. It is convenient to plot the normalized noise vs. the\nnormalized resistivity at constant temperature. In accordance with Eq.

(3)). Metals having\nqualities better than those of gold at 300 K, are indicated in bold letters.\nand 20 K are displayed in Fig. 2. Both the noise and resistivity data are\nnormalized to those of gold at T =300 K (thus, points appearing in the area\nrestricted by the solid lines correspond to values better than those of gold\nat room temperature). We may observe that at least three metals (molybdenum, zinc and platinum) at liquid nitrogen temperature and two metals\n(zirconium and titanium) at T =20 K have better characteristics than those\nof gold at T =300 K. For example, Ti-made wires cooled down to 20 K\nwill have a factor three reduction in the noise and four-fold reduction in the\nresistivity relative to gold at room temperature.\nFinally, let us note that in this analysis we are considering only the magnetic noise reduction due to the T /\u03c1 ratio appearing in Eq. (3). The geometrical factor Yij may also contribute to noise reduction because it depends on\nwire thickness. As the resistivity drops with cooling, wire thickness may be\n8\n\n\freduced while maintaining the same current. However, this may give rise to\nproblems such as enhanced relative surface roughness, which may in turn enhance harmful effects such as fragmentation. In addition, thickness reduction\nis limited as thinner films have an increased resistivity.\n\n4\n\nAlloys\n\nMore promising materials for a cooled atom chip could be found among\nnonmagnetic dilute metal alloys, whose residual resistivity is usually higher\nthan in pure metals. In alloys, such residual resistivity may be set to a\ndesired value by adjusting the material composition. The resistivity of a\ndilute binary alloy is given by\n\u03c1(x, T ) = \u03c10 (x) + \u03c1ph (T ) + \u2206(x, T ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the residual resistivity \u03c10 is proportional to the concentration x of the\nsolute metal and \u03c1ph is the phonon resistivity of the solvent metal, which\nis not changed by the addition of the solute metal, according to the well\nknown Matthiessen's rule. The last term in Eq. (7), \u2206(x, T ), is a correction\nto the Mathiessen's rule, which was intensively investigated in the literature\n(see, for example, [23]). This deviation represents a change in the temperature dependence of the resistivity at low temperatures and moderate solute\nconcentrations and its measurement is important for the study of scattering mechanisms in metals and alloys (for more details see Refs. [23]-[26]).\nHowever, its value relative to the total resistivity is small. Figure 3 shows\nthe measured values of resistivity for Ag-Au alloys at different concentrations and temperatures. The inset shows that the deviation \u2206 from the\nMatthiessen's rule is less than 10% for Au concentrations between 0.1% and\n10%. At concentrations as high as 2% or more it is negligible. In the following analysis we will therefore neglect the correction term \u2206 and assume\nthat the Matthiessen's rule is a good approximation for the calculation of\nthe magnetic noise.\nIf the solute concentration is not very high (up to x =10-15%, where\nordering processes may start changing the behavior) the residual resistivity\nof the alloy \u03c10 (x) increases linearly with increasing component ratio [23, 24,\n27]. This concentration dependent residual resistivity provides an additional\ndegree of freedom which can be controlled in order to obtain the desired\nmagnetic noise and resistivity of the chip material.

The \u03c1(T ) dependence for alloys\nwas calculated using the residual resistivity data given by [24, 30]. Note the\ndifference compared to Fig. 1.\nthe solute should not be too large. In accordance with our optimization\ncriteria, the alloy is effective as a chip wire material if its total resistivity does\nnot exceed gold resistivity at room temperature. In Fig. 4 the temperature\nbehavior of the normalized ratio T /\u03c1 is shown for a set of dilute Ag-Au\nalloys as well as for pure silver. The temperature dependencies \u03c1(T ) for the\nalloys were calculated using Eq. (7). The phonon resistivity data of silver\n(\u03c1ph, Ag (T )) were extracted from [20], and the experimental values of the\nresidual resistivity (\u03c10 (x)) for different gold concentrations x were extracted\nfrom references [24] and [30].\nFrom Fig. 4 one may conclude that the low temperature maximum in\nT /\u03c1, which is intrinsic for pure metals (Fig. 1), disappears with increasing\nx. This behavior is general for most of the dilute alloys. In particular, it\n11\n\n\fis valid for the alloys we analyze in the following. In Fig. 5 we plot the\nnormalized noise vs. normalized resistivity characteristics of the alloys AgAu, Cu-Au and Cu-Ge. As an example, the cooling of wires made of the alloy\nAg+5%Au down to T =77 K can reduce the noise by a factor of 5 relative\nto the level of pure silver at room temperature, and by a factor 3 relative\nto gold. The latter factor is almost the same as that achieved, for example,\nfor Pt in Fig. 2, but due to the unique alloy phenomena described above\n(Fig. 4), a pronounced difference will appear between Pt and Ag+5%Au as\nthe temperature is lowered further.\nAccording to Eq. (3), the product of the magnetic noise and the resistivity\nis linearly proportional to the temperature and independent of the material\n(as indicated by the sloped straight lines in Fig. 5). A cooling procedure\nwould reduce the magnetic noise relative to the magnetic noise of gold at\nroom temperature by a factor (T /300K) * (\u03c1Au,300K /\u03c1Alloy (T )). It is possible\nto choose the alloy concentration such that \u03c1Alloy (T ) = \u03c1Au,300K , so that the\nresistivity will be kept at the gold standard but the magnetic noise will be\nreduced by a factor of T /300K. Hence, the noise of an alloy-made conductor\ncould be reduced relative to the gold standard maximally by 4 times when\ncooling to liquid nitrogen temperature (T =77 K) and by 70 times by cooling\nto liquid helium temperature (T =4.2 K). This ratio of noise reduction is\nreached on the boundary of the optimization area. In particular, for the\nalloys Ag-Au, Cu-Au and Cu-Ge, the solute concentrations on this boundary\nequal 6%, 4.5% and 0.52% respectively (for T =4.2 K). The values were\nobtained from the \u03c10 (x) dependencies presented in [24, 29].\nThus, the main conclusion of this paper is that a significant simultaneous\nreduction of magnetic noise and resistivity is possible with both pure metals\nand alloys at 77K, and may be reduced even further by making use of alloys\nand further cooling. We note that a further advantage of wires made of\nalloys relative to pure metals, may perhaps be found in the fact that their\nresistivity is less sensitive to temperature fluctuations, since it is mainly due\nto the residual resistivity. This fact may contribute to current stability under\ntemperature variations in space (along the wire) or time.\nIn order to illustrate the effect of noise reduction on the lifetime of trapped\natoms we present the predicted lifetime of 87 Rb close to a metal wire similar\nto that used in Ref. [5]. Fig. 6 shows the experimental results together\nwith a theoretical curve simulating the experiment with the copper wire\nat T =400 K (\u03c1Cu = 2.64\u03bc\u03a9*cm).

Predicted\nlifetimes are also shown for a similar wire made of an alloy of Ag with 6% Au\ncontent, cooled down to T =77K (dashed) and 4.2K (dash-dotted). In both\ncases the resistivity was taken equal to gold resistivity at T =300 K, \u03c1Au =\n2.21\u03bc\u03a9*cm (same penetration depth). According to Fig. 5a, the needed gold\nconcentrations are estimated by x = 5.4% and x = 6%, respectively. Note\nthat our calculation differs from the one made in [5] (see Appendix A). Van\nder Waals forces are not taken into account. Let us also mention that the\nmaximum noise reduction factor of 70 noted in the text, is not visible, due\nto the effect of the technical noise and/or background gas collisions limiting\nthe lifetime in this experiment to a maximum of \u03c4tech = 2.5 s [31].\n\n14\n\n\fNo fitting parameters were used, except for assuming a distance independent\nscattering rate of 0.4 s\u22121 [5, 31]. The predicted lifetimes for a similar wire\nmade of the alloy Ag+6%Au, and cooled down to T =77K or 4.2K, are also\npresented. They show that lifetimes can be increased by more than an order\nof magnitude. When cooling down to 4.2K, the atomic lifetime is close to\nthe limit set by (distance independent) background scattering even when the\natoms are held 1\u03bcm from the wire.\nAs suggested by Fig. 1, the magnetic noise will not be reduced by cooling\nthe copper wires, as long as it obeys the T /\u03c1 law. However, as the temperature becomes smaller, one approaches the regime where the penetration\ndepth \u03b4 gets shorter than characteristic scales like the trap height d, and the\nT /\u03c1 law must be amended. As mentioned before, in the simple case of an\ninfinitely thick metal layer, the noise power can be multiplied by the interpolation factor (1 + 2d3/3\u03b4 3 )\u22121 to get the scaling for short skin depth [11].\nAt large distances, the T /(\u03c1d) law is thus replaced by the asymptotic law\n\u221a\n3\n(2/\u03bc0 \u03c9f 0 )3/2 T \u03c1/d4 with a more favorable scaling with temperature. In\n2\nFigure 7 we compare the noise (relative to the standard of gold at room temperature) for a Ag-Au alloy and for a copper wire at 4.2 K, as a function of\ndistance. It is seen that the noise from a cooled copper wire drops below the\nnoise from a wire made of an alloy only at d > 45\u03bcm. This value is expected\nto be even bigger if a wire thickness t < \u03b4 would be taken into account. We\nrecall that the interpolation factor mentioned above actually overestimates\nthe magnetic noise power, as illustrated in Ref.[11] and in Ref. [4] by comparing to numerical calculation and experimental data, respectively. The\nmaximal observed discrepancy is about a factor of 3 at d = \u03b4. On the other\nhand, one can expect an increase of the pure metal \u03b4 at cold temperatures,\ndue to the fact that typical pure metal wires have larger residual resistivities\nthan the numbers used in our calculation. For example, Ref. [5] calculated\n\u03b4 = 103 \u03bcm while our calculation uses \u033a = 100 which leads to \u03b4 = 92 \u03bcm. In\nsummary, it follows that as far as magnetic noise is concerned, cooled wires\nmade of alloys are preferable over cooled wires made of pure metals over a\nlarge range of distances from the atom chip.\nFinally, we consider in Appendix B the feasibility of cooling current carrying wires to low temperatures. We analyze the expected heating due to the\nohmic resistance and find that for considerable current densities, the temperature rise in the wires does not significantly alter the results presented in\nthis paper.\n\n15\n\n\fRelative noise\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nDistance [\u03bcm]\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFigure 7: Magnetic noise relative to the room temperature gold standard for\nan Ag-Au alloy (dashed line) at a temperature of 4.2 K and for a pure copper\nwire at 4.2 K (solid line) as a function of distance from the chip. The noise\nwas calculated based on the interpolation formula of Ref. [11] (see text). The\npenetration depths used for copper and the Ag-Au alloy are \u03b4 = 7.4\u03bcm and\n\u03b4 = 84\u03bcm, respectively.\n\n16\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have analyzed the dependence of magnetic fluctuations near the surface\nof conducting elements on an atom chip, on the material type and the temperature. We have shown that at low temperatures a significant reduction of\nthe noise can be achieved by making the conducting wires from dilute alloys\nof noble metals.\nThis improvement is due to the large value of the temperature independent residual resistivity of the alloys compared to pure noble metals, which is\ncontrollable by smoothly changing the solute component concentration. At\nleast three important advantages of cooling wires made of alloys could be\nunderlined: (i) reduction of the magnetic noise, thereby decreasing loss rate,\nheating and decoherence; (ii) possible reduction of the resistivity of the wires,\nand (iii) enhancement of temperature stability. With the data presented in\nthis work, it is possible to identify alloys that reach a minimum noise level\nthat is set by that of the expected technical noise.\nFinally, we note that for optimal noise reduction, a complete optimization is required for every specific situation. Such an optimization should take\ninto account not only the T /\u03c1 ratio analyzed in this work, but also the geometrical factor, which includes important parameters such as wire thickness,\nand trap height (see the discussion in Ref. [17] for flat wires). We note that\nthe geometrical parameters also define the validity borders of the T /\u03c1 approximation, and corrections have to be applied when the penetration depth\nbecomes comparable to wire thickness or trap height.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Yu-Ju Lin and Joerg Schmiedmayer for useful discussions.

[5] the lifetime of trapped atoms was measured above the center of a\nrectangular copper wire of thickness t = 2.15\u03bcm and width w = 10\u03bcm. The\ntemperature of the wire was estimated as 400 K (\u03c1Cu = 2.64\u03bc\u03a9*cm). The\nmeasurements were performed with 87 Rb atoms trapped in the hyperfine\nstate |F, mi = |2, 2i. The loss process was assumed to be due to the cascade\nof transitions |2, 2i \u2192 |2, 1i \u2192 |2, 0i. By use of Eq. (1) and Eq. (3) we obtain\nfor this kind of transitions\n\u03bc2 \u03bc2 g 2 kB T X\nYjj |hF, m|Fj |F, m \u2212 1i|2\n(13)\n\u0393|F,mi\u2192|F,m\u22121i = 0 B 2F\n4\u03c0 \u03c1\nj\nwhere we have substituted \u03bcj = \u03bcB gF Fj . The contribution of off-diagonal\nterms of Yij vanishes, given the symmetric position above the center of the\nwire.\n18\n\n\fIn Ref. [5], the total lifetime of the trapped states due to magnetic noise\nwas approximated to be \u03c4mag \u2248 \u03c41 + \u03c42 , where \u03c42 and \u03c41 , which are the\nlifetimes of the respective levels |2, 2i and |2, 1i, are equal to the inverse\nof the transition rates \u03b321 = \u0393|2,2i\u2192|2,1i and \u03b310 = \u0393|2,1i\u2192|2,0i . A complete\napproach should take into account that the transition frequency between the\nmagnetic levels is in the order of MHz, while the temperature of the surface is\nseveral orders of magnitude larger. This means that the atoms have an equal\nprobability for transitions from |2, 2i into |2, 1i and vice versa. We assume\nthat atoms that decayed into the untrapped level |2, 0i escape immediately\nfrom the trap region. The rate equations are then\nd\nP|2,2i = \u2212\u03b321 (P|2,2i \u2212 P|2,1i )\ndt\nd\nP|2,1i = \u03b321 (P|2,2i \u2212 P|2,1i ) \u2212 \u03b310 P|2,1i\ndt\nd\nP|2,0i = \u03b310 P|2,1i\ndt\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nFor our calculation, we make use of |h2, 2|Fj |2, 1i|2 = 1 and |h2, 1|Fj |2, 0i|2 =\n3/2 for j = x, z, where we assume the direction of the magnetic field to\nbe along the wire axis (y direction). We thus have \u03b310 /\u03b321 = 3/2, and the\nsolution to the rate equations yields\nPmag = P|2,2i + P|2,1i =\n\ni\n1 h \u2212\u03b321 t/2\n6e\n\u2212 e\u22123\u03b321 t\n5\n\n(17)\n\n\u22121\nThis gives an effective (1/e) lifetime of \u03c4 = 2.364\u03b321\n.\nIn Fig. 8 we compare this calculation (solid line) to the simpler model\ndescribed above where \u03c4mag = \u03c41 + \u03c42 (dashed line), while using the same geometrical factors. For completeness, we also present the calculation of ref. [5]\n(dash-dotted line), who have used an interpolated formula for the geometrical\nfactor. The experimental trap lifetime is restricted by technical noise and/or\nbackground gas collisions to a maximum of \u03c4tech = 2.5 s [31]. Hence the to\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\ntal trap lifetime is equal to \u03c4trap = (\u03c4mag\n+ \u03c4tech\n) . The geometrical factors\nYij were calculated using Eqs. (9)-(11). We see that the complete approach\n(solid line) gives a better agreement with experiment than the calculation\nbased on the simplified model (dashed line). Based on this comparison, we\nmake use of the complete approach, and present in Fig. 6 the expected trap\nlifetime for the alloy Ag-Au for different cooling temperatures.\n\n19\n\n\flifetime [s]\n\n3\n2\n1\n0.5\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8\nheight [\u03bcm]\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFigure 8: The trapping lifetimes of 87 Rb atoms above a wire on an atom chip\nfor the data presented in Ref. [5]. The plot presents a comparison between the\ntwo calculation methods presented in the text and the calculation of Ref. [5]\n(dash-dotted line). The dashed line represents the taking into account of\ntransitions in one direction only while the solid line represents the complete\napproach.\n\n20\n\n\fHopefully, one would be able to construct a more complete theory that\nis compatible with the full theory presented in ref. [11], while still enabling\na practical calculation of finite structures [15]. We then expect that at low\nheights above the surface (smaller than the penetration depth in the metal),\nthe parallel components Y11 and Y22 will decrease by a factor of 1/3, giving\nrise to an increase of the calculated lifetime by a factor of 5/3. On the other\nhand, the measurements of ref. [5] were performed with a thermal atomic\ncloud of temperature 1 \u03bcK. One then expects that the cloud expands in the\nx, z directions to a radius of \u223c 0.5 \u03bcm, so that the loss rate is significantly\nincreased for the fraction of atoms that are closer to the metal surface. The\ndeformation of the trapping potential due to atom-surface interactions of\nthe van der Waals type (not included in Fig. 6) may also contribute to an\nincreased loss rate. These effects may perhaps explain the noted difference\nbetween all the calculated curves and the experimental results at low heights\nabove the surface.\n\nB\n\nFeasibility of cooling current carrying wires\n\nIn Ref. [32] it was shown that the heating of a metal wire on an atom chip\nis characterized by two time scales: a fast time scale related to heat transfer\nthrough the contact and/or insulating layer from the metal into the substrate\nfollowed by slow heating due to heat transfer in the substrate. Heat transfer\nthrough the contact and/or insulating layer depends on the heat conductivity\nk of these layers. For a single contact layer of effective thickness dc and heat\nconductivity \u03bbc the number k is given by k = \u03bbc /dc . For a wire of width w,\nthickness h and resistivity \u03c1(T ) the equation of heat transfer is\nhCW\n\n\u2202\n\u2206T = h\u03c1(T )j 2 \u2212 k\u2206T,\n\u2202t\n\n(18)\n\nwhere CW is the heat capacity of the metal, h\u03c1j 2 is the rate of generation of\nheat per unit wire area and \u2206T = T \u2212 T0 is the temperature rise above the\nsubstrate temperature T0 . To get a rough estimate of \u2206T after the heating\nwe assume here that \u03c1(T ) is constant within \u2206T (for instance, as presented\nin Fig. 5a, the resistivity of our example alloy Ag+5%Au hardly changes in\nthe range of 4-77K). We then obtain a steady state value of \u2206T :\n\u2206T = h\u03c1j 2 /k .\n21\n\n(19)\n\n\f200\n100\n7\n\n0\n\nTemperature rise [ K]\n\n2\n\nj=10 A/cm\n\n50\n\n20\n6\n\n2\n\nj=5\u00d710 A/cm\n10\n5\n\nj=2\u00d7106A/cm2\n\n2\n1\n\nj=106A/cm2\n0.5\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n0\nTemperature [ K]\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 9: Temperature rise in a current carrying wire as a function of the\ninitial system temperature, and for different current densities. The wire\ngeometry was taken to be as in Ref. [32]. The temperature rise includes the\nfast rise and a slow rise for 30s.\nThe process of slow heating was modeled in Ref. [32] in a two dimensional\nmodel with an analytic and numeric solution. It was found that the slow\ntemperature rise is given by\nhw\u03c1j 2\n4\u03c0 2 \u03bbt\n\u2206Ts =\n,\nln\n2\u03c0\u03bb\nCw 2\n!\n\n(20)\n\nwhere C and \u03bb are the heat capacity and conductivity of the substrate,\nrespectively.\nTypical values of \u2206T as a function of the initial temperature are given in\nFig. ?? for a few values of current density j. The temperature rise contains\nthe fast heating and slow heating after 30s. The calculation was done for\nthe geometry of Ref. [32], namely w = 5\u03bcm, h = 1.4\u03bcm and \u03c1 = \u03c1Au,300 K .\nSince the dependence of the heating on the current density j is quadratic,\nit follows that if the temperature of a wire holding a current density of 107\n22\n\n\fA/cm2 rises by 50 K, then a wire with current density of 106 A/cm2 heats\nonly by 0.5 K.\nWe may conclude that the reduction of magnetic noise by cooling will always be limited by wire heating if the current density in the wire is large. The\nheating will still be negligible for current densities of the order of 106 A/cm2\nor less. One should note that improved geometries, such as wires buried in\nthe wafer (thus transferring heat to the wafer through 3 facets), will further\nimprove the allowed current densities.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
