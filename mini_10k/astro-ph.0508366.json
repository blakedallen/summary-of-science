This\ndetection highlights the increasing complexity of structure being revealed in recent surveys of\nthe Milky Way thick disk and Halo.\nKey words: Galaxy: structure \u2013 Galaxy: formation \u2013 galaxies: interactions\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nGalaxy formation based on a \u039bCDM cosmology predicts larger\nstructures being formed from the accumulation of smaller systems (e.g. Searle & Zinn 1978; White & Rees 1978; White 1978;\nAbadi, Navarro, Steinmetz, & Eke 2003a,b). One of the core outcomes of this model is that the halos of galaxies should be strewn\nwith the debris from all these minor mergers. The first discovery of such a merger within our own Milky Way, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Ibata, Gilmore, & Irwin 1994), demonstrated that\nsuch mergers do occur and are in fact ongoing.\nInsight into the complex nature of the Galactic Halo has\nbeen in part accomplished by recent all sky surveys, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS). Investigating an overdensity of F-turnoff stars in the\nSDSS, Newberg et al. (2002) discovered the presence of a stream\nof stars suggestive of an equatorial accretion event around the\nMilky Way. Unlike the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy which is on a polar\norbit, this accretion event may have implications on the formation\nof key Galactic structures, such as the thick disk. The equatorial\norbit of the stream was investigated by Crane et al. (2003) who targeted 2MASS selected M-giant stars in the range l = 150\u25e6 - 240\u25e6 ,\nalthough primarily in the Northern hemisphere, finding that a simple circular orbit model with a galactocentric radius of 18 kpc and\n\nvelocity of \u223c220 km s\u22121 best fit the data. The velocity dispersion\nof their sample was 20\u00b14 km s\u22121 which excludes it from being\nof Galactic origins. As more detections of this structure were made\n(Yanny et al. 2004; Ibata et al. 2003; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2003) it became clear that, as proposed by Newberg et al. (2002), this was indeed another on-going accretion event. The search for the progenitor of the stream in the 2MASS catalog led Martin et al. (2004a)\nto uncover the Canis Major dwarf galaxy (l,b) = \u223c(240\u25e6 ,-8\u25e6 ).\nBecause of the low density of stream material on the sky\nit has been necessary to employ the use of Wide-Field Cameras to look deeply into Milky Way's thick disk and Halo, not\nonly confirming and enhancing previous detections but probing\nnew regions leading to more detections of the Monoceros Ring\nand the Canis Major dwarf being made (Martin et al. 2004a;\nBellazzini et al. 2004; Conn et al. 2005; Mart\u00ednez-Delgado et al.\n2005). Detections of an additional structure in TriangulumAndromedae (Rocha-Pinto et al. 2004; Majewski et al. 2004) are\nrevealing the increasing complexity of accretion events in the outer\nregions of the Galaxy. Current debate on these detections centres on\nwhether these represent separate accretion events or are the product\nof a single ongoing merger. The location of the progenitor is still\ncontentious but this paper will refer to the Canis Major overdensity\nas the Canis Major dwarf galaxy (CMa), following the conclusions\nof Mart\u00ednez-Delgado et al. (2005) and Martin et al. (2005a).\n\n\f2\n\nBlair Conn et al.\n\nWhile the positions of the streams on the sky are highly accurate, the distance estimates to the stars are less so, requiring\nthe need for radial velocity kinematic measurements to increase\nand characterize the known properties of the streams. Distances\nare then estimated through photometric parallaxes as described in\nMartin et al. (2004b). To date, several kinematic surveys of the\nMonoceros Stream have been undertaken using the data of 2MASS\nand SDSS (Yanny et al. 2004; Crane et al. 2003; Rocha-Pinto et al.\n2004). These have confirmed a velocity gradient with Galactic longitude and also a low velocity dispersion of \u03c3(vr ) \u223c20 km s\u22121 for\nthe Monoceros Ring.\nWhile most models of equatorial accretion onto disk-like\ngalaxies (e.g. Pe\u00f1arrubia et al. 2005; Martin et al. 2005a) predict\nthe presence of multiply wrapped streams, no detections provide\nconclusive evidence supporting this hypothesis. This is most likely\ndue to the pencil beam nature of most fields with regard the entire structure on the sky and given that confirmed detections of\nthe stream are limited to galactic longitudes (120\u25e6 < l < 240\u25e6 )\nand significant areas of this structure are yet to be sampled. This\nnew detection presented here is consistent with multiply wrapped\nstreams.\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\nIn April 2004, a survey was undertaken with the 2dF (Two-degree\nField) multi-fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope\n(AAT) with two aims: firstly, to determine the kinematics of the Canis Major dwarf, and secondly to try and locate the stars belonging\nto the Monoceros Ring through kinematic constraints. Out of \u223c15\nfields, eight were dedicated to this purpose, four focusing solely on\nthe Canis Major region. This paper will focus primarily on results\npertaining to the detection of the Monoceros Ring in the Canis Major dwarf region, the same area studied by Martin et al. (2005a);\nhereafter Paper I.\nThe 2dF instrument is capable of measuring velocities of\n\u223c400 stars simultaneously within a two degree field of view. The\nfield is divided between two spectrographs, the first using a 1200V\ngrating (4600-5600\u00c5 at 1\u00c5/pixel); the second using a 1200R grating (8000-9000\u00c5 at 1\u00c5/pixel). The configuration on the second\nspectrograph was chosen to target Red Clump stars in the distance\nrange 5-8 kpc, these stars fall outside the distance range expected\nfor the Monoceros Ring and thus are not discussed in this paper.\n(Paper I discusses the results of the survey in the region <10 kpc.)\nThe Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars in this survey were chosen\nfrom Sample A of Martin et al. (2004a). Using the photometric parallax technique of Majewski, Skrutskie, Weinberg, & Ostheimer\n(2003) to determine the distances, the stars in the correct distance\nrange for the Monoceros Ring can then be easily selected. Determining the exact error on the distance using this technique is difficult and so for these observations a conservative estimate of \u00b11\nkpc for these stars has been assumed. The J,H,K magnitudes from\nthe 2MASS catalogue for these stars have been de-reddened using\nthe dust maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) and the\nasymptotic correction of Bonifacio et al. (2000).\n2.1 Reducing 2dF spectra\nData reduction of the 2dF spectra involves using the 2dFDR package (Taylor et al. 1996) which applies the flat field correction, sky\nsubtraction and extracts the individual spectra from each fibre off\nthe CCD. Due to an asymmetry in the Line Spread Function (LSF)\n\nof the spectra a custom-made reduction pipeline was constructed\nto minimise the errors this produced when comparing with radial\nvelocity standard stars; a detailed presentation of the pipeline can\nbe found in Martin et al. (2005b). This pipeline limits the systematic offsets in the radial velocity due to the LSF to \u00b15 km s\u22121 ,\nthis value is not included in the errors stated. Determining the radial velocities, vr , using several artificial standard star templates\nand taking a weighted average of the solutions avoids any systematic offset that may result from a peculiarity in one of the templates (Martin et al. 2005a,b). Stars then with \u03c3v > 5 km s\u22121 (See\nEquation 2 of Paper I) are removed from the sample to avoid contaminating the results with poor determination of radial velocity.\nDust extinction in this region typically is E(B-V)<0.4 (taken from\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998) and only the field closest to\nthe plane has higher extinction. There has been no significant impact on the 2MASS colours due to extinction.\n\n2.2 Determining the Fit and the Associated Error\nFor each velocity and distance distribution, a Gaussian has been\nfitted to the profile using an amoeba routine (Press et al. 1992),\nobtaining a characteristic velocity, velocity dispersion, distance and\ndistance dispersion which best represents the data. The errors on the\nfitted parameters were determined by bootstrap re-sampling and\nthen refitting the data. The re-sampling was undertaken using the\nerrors of each quantity namely the conservative \u00b11 kpc for the\ndistance to each star and the root-mean-square value of the dispersion. The errors cited then, are the standard deviations of the fit\ndetermined using this method. There is no appreciable difference\nbetween the galactocentric and heliocentric errors in this field. The\nvelocity errors also have an additional \u00b15 km s\u22121 systematic error\non top of the stated errors.\n\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 The Monoceros Ring behind the Canis Major dwarf\nThe data in Figure 1 was taken from six fields of the 2dF spectrographic survey and shows a population of \u223c38 RGB stars behind\nthe Canis Major overdensity. These stars are represented in the solid\nhistogram while the dashed histogram is the remaining stars in that\nregion. The stars have been selected using the following criteria,\n231.5\u25e6<l<247.5\u25e6 and -11.8\u25e6<b<-3.8\u25e6 ; 12 kpc<D\u2299<20 kpc and\na colour cut of 0.9 <(J-K)\u25e6< 1.3; 0.561(J-K)\u25e6 + 0.22 < (J-H)\u25e6 <\n0.561(J-K)\u25e6 + 0.36; K\u25e66 13.0; with vr > 0 km s\u22121 . This overdensity shows up very clearly in the galactocentric distance histogram\nand given the distance range of these stars makes them different\nfrom the foreground Canis Major stars as presented in Paper I. They\nform a coherent velocity and distance structure similar to that of\nprevious Monoceros Ring detections. Figure 1 shows the 2dF Data\nwith a Gaussian fit of vr =132.8\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 and internal dispersion of 22.7\u00b11.7 km s\u22121 , which is comparable to the dispersion\nas measured by Yanny et al. (2004) from SDSS data. The galactocentric distance estimates to this feature are 18.9\u00b10.3 kpc with\na dispersion of 0.8\u00b10.4 kpc. See \u00a72.2 or Paper I for a more complete breakdown on the errors, however note again that the errors\nhave an additional systematic offset of \u00b15 km s\u22121 . To test the contamination of local dwarfs which fall inside the selection criteria\nfor the sample stars due to poor extinction correction, the data has\nbeen tested with a more stringent cutoff of (J-K)\u25e6 >0.95.

Histogram of the 2dF RGB data in the range 231.5\u25e6<l<247.5\u25e6 and -11.8\u25e6<b<-3.8\u25e6 ; with a heliocentric distance cut of 12 kpc< D\u2299 <20 kpc and\nthe following additional cuts of 0.9 <(J-K)\u25e6< 1.3; 0.561(J-K)\u25e6 + 0.22 < (J-H)\u25e6< 0.561(J-K)\u25e6 + 0.36; K\u25e66 13.0 and vr > 0 km s\u22121 . This field constitutes\nthe region behind the Canis Major overdensity revealing a detection of the Monoceros Ring at a galactocentric distance of 18.9\u00b10.3 kpc and a dispersion of\n0.8\u00b10.4 kpc (right panel) with a heliocentric distance of 13.5\u00b10.3 kpc with similar dispersion (middle panel). The velocity profile fitted to this population\nis vr =132.8\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 with an internal dispersion of 22.7\u00b11.7 km s\u22121 (left panel), the error is accompanied by an additional systematic offset of\n\u00b15 km s\u22121 . The dashed lines shows the remaining data outside the distance and colour cut. For a full outline of the errors see \u00a72.2 and Paper I.\n\nreproduces the detection presented here suggesting the contamination level is low.\nAlthough, as can be seen in Figure 1, there is no definitive evidence for a gap between the Canis Major detection and the Monoceros Ring detection this is most likely due to the large errors in the\ndistance rather than the structure being somewhat continuous out\nto large galactocentric distances. The conservatively estimated error on the distance is \u223c1 kpc, which will have the effect of blurring\nany intrinsic gap between the two structures. Contamination from\nlocal dwarfs although believed to be minimal will also impact on\nthe ability to resolve the stream out cleanly from the Canis Major\npopulation. It should also be noted that depending on the formation\nscenario of the stream the stars may or may not be neatly confined\nat one distance but rather diffused over a larger volume. Since the\norigins and evolution of both structures is still being investigated,\nexplaining the lack of a gap in distance is at best speculative. With\nthese stars being selected from the 2MASS catalogue a measure\nof the completeness of the sample becomes possible. Applying the\ncolour cuts used on the 2dF data to the 2MASS catalogue reveals\n399 stars in this region of which 364 have been observed making\nthis sample \u223c91% complete.\nIn Paper I, a northern comparison field at (240.0\u25e6 , +8.8\u25e6 ) is\npresented for the Canis Major detection. Unfortunately, the number\nof RGB stars sampled out to large Galactic radii is too low to form\na useful comparison with the detection presented in this paper.\n3.2 The Besan\u00e7on Synthetic Galaxy Model\nUnderstanding what the Galactic contribution is in any given region of sky is critical when attempting to interpret the results of\nthis 2dF survey. To investigate this, the synthetic galaxy model of\nRobin, Reyl\u00e9, Derri\u00e8re & Picaud (2003) is used to find out what the\nmodel predicts our Galactic contamination should be. This is done\nby selecting the exact same regions of sky as observed in the 2dF\nsurvey. Given the tight constraints in colour and magnitude used\nto select the stars in our survey (see Paper I) applying the same\nconstraints to the synthetic Galaxy model to provide an idea of the\n\ncontamination we should expect was undertaken. In particular these\nare: 0.9 < (J-K)\u25e6< 1.3; 0.561(J-K)\u25e6 + 0.22 < (J-H)\u25e6< 0.561(J-K)\u25e6\n+ 0.36; K\u25e66 13.0; vr > 0 km s\u22121 . The cuts were applied to the\nmodel which extended to a heliocentric distance of 100 kpc .\nTo remove the presence of noise in the model, each field was\ninvestigated using the online model selecting the small field setting\nwith a solid angle of 1000 deg2 . This has the effect of providing a\nsmoother distribution of the stars with the properties determined by\nthe centre of the field, rather than the large field option which takes\ninto account changes in (l,b)\u25e6 . Each field is then rescaled back to\nthe size of the 2dF fields and rescaled to match the completeness\nof the 2dF sample with regard the 2MASS catalogue. These stars\nare presented in Figure 2 and in general have a much broader distribution than could be attributed to any tidal debris with velocities\nwhich typically peak well away from the 2dF detections. As expected, in the distance range of the MRi there is no thin disk population and with the thick disk only having \u223c15 stars in this location;\nhalo stars are expected to only have a very small presence in this\nfield and are not included in these results. The comparisons with\nthe Besan\u00e7on model provide good support for the validity of this\ndetection with the usual precautions.\nThe approximately 15 stars which fall in the region of the\nMRi in the model have the following properties, a velocity profile\nof vr = 143.8 km s\u22121 and dispersion of 28.2 km s\u22121 ; galactocentric distance profile of 19.7 kpc with a dispersion of 1.9 kpc. A\nKolmogorov-Smirnoff test of the MRi stars from the 2dF sample\nand the Besan\u00e7on stars finds a 4% chance of the two being drawn\nfrom the same distribution. This is a relatively high probability of\ncoincidence however a few extra factors need to be taken into account. While the model contains thick disk stars with an additional\nwarp component, the data contains thick disk stars, CMa stars and\nMRi stars with a warp component mixed in. What effect does this\nhave on our comparison? Since a completeness factor has been derived from the 2MASS catalogue and subsequently used to scale\nthe Besan\u00e7on model and given the 2MASS stars contains a significant proportion of CMa stars then the numbers of thick disk stars\nmust be being overestimated. This has the immediate effect of low-\n\n\f4\n\nBlair Conn et al.\n\nFigure 2. Histogram of Besan\u00e7on data covering the same region of sky as the 2dF dataset; no distance cuts have been applied less than the 100 kpc cutoff of\nthe model. The distances are galactocentric to allow easy comparison with the 2dF data as shown in Figure 1. The top panels show the thin disk population\n(stars in the age range 5-7 Gyrs) in this field fitted with a Gaussian profile at a distance of \u223c11.1 kpc and a dispersion of \u223c1.7 kpc. The velocity profile of the\nthin disk stars is vr = \u223c71.4 km s\u22121 with a dispersion of \u223c32.3 km s\u22121 . In the bottom panels are the thick disk stars (noting that these stars have a different\ndensity profile than the thin disk stars) they too can be fitted with a Gaussian profile and reside at a galactocentric distance of 13.1 kpc with a dispersion\nof 5.0 kpc, the velocity and dispersion are found to be vr = 115.9 km s\u22121 and 47.7 km s\u22121 respectively. The smaller Gaussians represent those 15 stars in\nthe same distance range as the MRi stars in Figure 1 with vr = 143.8 km s\u22121 and a dispersion of 28.2 km s\u22121 ; galactocentric distance of 19.7 kpc with a\ndispersion of 1.9 kpc.\n\nering the number of stars that can be expected in the distance range\nof the MRi. The true number of Galactic thick disk stars would be\nmuch less than the \u223c15 stars presented in Figure 2, especially since\nmost of the stars as presented in Paper I seem to belong to the CMa\nstructure and that confusion over whether they represent the warp\nseems to have been sufficently discounted.\n\n4 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION\nComparisons with the Besan\u00e7on synthetic galaxy model (Figure 2)\nreveal that the peak velocity and dispersion observed in this field\ncannot be associated with any known Galactic component. The\nthick disk component in the same region as the MRi has a higher\nvelocity and a broader velocity dispersion which discounts it as the\ncause of the overdensity measured in this field (see Figure 1). This\nis supported by the finding that the numbers of thick disk stars in\nthe model are being overestimated (after scaling) due to the presence of the CMa structure boosting the numbers of stars in the\nregion. Although difficult to quantify it is expected that the numbers of Galactic thick disk stars should be much less than the \u223c15\nstars as currently predicted. Investigating any similarities with previous detections of the Monoceros Ring finds encouraging agreement in the velocity dispersion estimates of Yanny et al. (2004)\nand Crane et al. (2003), which have values of 13 - 24 km s\u22121 and\n20\u00b14 km s\u22121 , respectively compared to 22.7\u00b11.7 km s\u22121 from\nthis paper.\nThe best model of the MRi with which to compare our detection is the Crane et al. (2003) circular orbit model since we target\nsimilar stars (M giant stars extracted from 2MASS) and since they\nreach a Galactic longitude of l\u223c220 in the Southern hemisphere\nand l\u223c240 degrees in the Northern hemisphere. Moreover, as has\nalready been noticed, the velocity dispersion of our sample (\u03c3 =\n\n22.7\u00b11.7 km s\u22121 ) is statistically similar to the Crane et al. (2003)\nvalue (20\u00b14 km s\u22121 ). It can be seen on Figure 3, where our targets are plotted as filled circles, that the velocity of our sample\nis only slightly higher than that expected by the circular model.\nSuch a small discrepancy is not unexpected since the MRi population certainly does not follow a perfectly circular orbit (as is\nhinted by detections at different galactocentric distances within the\n14<DGC <20 kpc distance range). Moreover, a closer look at Figure 2 of Crane et al. (2003) reveals the stars at high longitude in\ntheir sample (l>\u223c220 deg) also tend to have a radial velocity 2030 km s\u22121 higher than the circular orbit model. Thus, our detection\nof the Monoceros Ring is consistent with the current knowledge of\nthis outer disk structure.\nEquatorial accretion models predict the presence of wrapped\ntidal arms and this detection provides a tentative confirmation of\nsuch a scenario. A plausible alternative is that both the foreground\nCanis Major detection and the background Monoceros Ring detection represent separate accretion events. However, such a situation\ncomplicates the picture with the requirement of two progenitor systems hidden somewhere in the Milky Way. Hence, we conclude that\nthe probable scenario is that the Canis Major dwarf and the Monoceros Ring represent a single accretion event and this new detection\nis of a wrapped tidal arm.\n\n5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nBCC's thanks go to the Anglo-Australian Observatory and the\nANU Lodge for the technical support and hospitality received\nduring his stay.
