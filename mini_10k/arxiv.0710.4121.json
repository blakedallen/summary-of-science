With only one Higgs doublet, like in the Standard Model, all charged scalar\ndegrees of freedom present are needed to provide the longitudinal degrees of freedom of\nthe charged electroweak bosons W \u00b1 .\nThe search for charged Higgs bosons proceeds currently at the Tevatron and will be\ntaken up by the LHC experiments in the near future. For the Tevatron the only significant\nproduction mode of charged Higgs bosons is from the decay of top quarks in tt\u0304 production\nevents. In the presently unprobed range of charged Higgs mass values, mH \u00b1 , above the\nLEP limit of about 80 GeV [1], this is the only relevant channel which can be reached\nwith significant statistics given the luminosity and collision energy of the protons and\nanti-protons at the Tevatron. The observability of this channel relies on the values of the\nYukawa couplings of the charged Higgs boson to top and bottom quarks and to \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 . The\nformer determines the production rate, while the latter enters the branching ratios for\nthe decays H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 . Overproduction of \u03c4 leptons compared to the SM expectation is\nthe primary signature of charged Higgs bosons. The best H \u00b1 search channels at hadron\ncolliders identified so far, depend on Yukawa interactions of heavy quarks. Furthermore,\nin Two-Higgs-Doublet-Models, the H \u00b1 Yukawa couplings depend strongly on the ratio of\nthe vacuum expectation values v2 /v1 \u2261 tan \u03b2 of the two Higgs-doublets. Therefore, the\ndiscovery reach for a charged Higgs boson at hadron colliders in such models also depends\nstrongly on the value of tan \u03b2. For instance, in the Type-II THDM and the MSSM, the\nmass reach in the intermediate tan \u03b2-region around tan \u03b2 = 15 is rather low compared to\nthe high- and low-tan \u03b2 region, even at the LHC.\nWith an electron\u2013positron collider, the detection of a charged Higgs boson is rather\nstraightforward if its energy allows for H + H \u2212 pair production. As the tree-level amplitude\nfor this process consists of s-channel photon and Z-boson exchange, the production cross\nsection is essentially independent of other parameters of the model the charged Higgs boson\nis embedded in. Furthermore, for mH \u00b1 above the top\u2013bottom threshold, the dominant\ndecay mode H \u00b1 \u2192 tb can be utilised to search for charged Higgs bosons [2], unlike at hadron\ncolliders where processes with these decay modes are swamped by background events. The\nmass-reach of the pair production process as a search channel at an electron positron\ncollider is essentially independent of tan \u03b2 and only limited by the available collision energy\n\u221a\ns.\nIt is a topic of current research to explore the mass-reach of a future electron\n\u221a positron\ncollider for charged Higgs bosons beyond the pair production limit of about s/2. Single\nproduction of one charged Higgs boson in association with one or a few particles with\nan overall mass less than mH \u00b1 can proceed via several channels. Unfortunately, the electroweak gauge bosons as intermediate particles normally do not lead to tree-level processes\nsimilar to Higgs-strahlung or vector-boson fusion for neutral Higgs boson production. The\nreason is that the ZW \u00b1 H \u2213 interaction is absent in any Higgs sector model with multiple doublets and restricted to have a quite small coupling constant in many other models\nbecause of the measured electroweak \u03c1-parameter [3].\n1\n\n\fThe only relevant single charged Higgs boson production process with only two particles\nin the final state is the (effectively) loop-induced W \u00b1 H \u2213 production which has been studied\nin detail in the general THDM and the MSSM [4, 5, 6]. Relevant processes with a tree-level\namplitude start with three particles in the final-state. Among those, the final states H \u00b1 tb\n[7, 8] and H \u00b1 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 [8, 9] appear to be the most promising.\nThe loop-induced process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 e+ \u03bde (and its charge conjugate) have also been\nsuggested as potential charged Higgs boson discovery processes. Unlike in charged Higgs\nboson production together with tb or \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 , this process has t-channel Feynman graphs, similar to the vector boson fusion process in the SM, which grows like log(s/m2H \u00b1 ) for s \u226b m2H \u00b1 .\nThe cross section for this process has been calculated in various approximations. For the\ncalculation of the THDM cross section in Ref. [8] only the t-channel Feynman graphs\nhave been considered with insertions of effective vertices for the loop-induced \u03b3W \u00b1 H \u2213\nand ZW \u00b1 H \u2213 interaction. Among the contributions to those one-loop vertices, bosonic\ncontributions, i.e. contributions from virtual Higgs, Goldstone and gauge bosons, have\nbeen checked to be small in the region where the vertex interactions are substantial and\nthen neglected in the numerical evaluation in [8]. In Ref. [10] the THDM cross section is\ncalculated taking all terms quadratic in the H \u00b1 tb Yukawa couplings into account. This\namounts to taking all one-loop Feynman graphs with top and bottom quarks into account\nand neglecting all bosonic contributions. Thus, in this study the s-channel contributions\nhave been included in the top\u2013bottom loop approximation. In Ref. [11] preliminary results\nhave been reported on an evaluation of the MSSM cross section using the approximation\nof only taking fermion and sfermion loops into account. In this calculation, also all contributions from virtual gauge and Higgs bosons have been neglected. Furthermore, all other\ncontributions from virtual superpartners which do not contain a closed sfermion loop have\nbeen neglected as well.\nThe current state of research concerning the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 e+ \u03bde + (c.c.) leaves\nquite a few open questions which we would like to address in this paper. First, neglecting the bosonic contributions was justified in [8, 10] by their reported smallness in the\nloop-induced \u03b3W \u00b1 H \u2213 and ZW \u00b1 H \u2213 interactions [5]. Yet, in the process at hand there are\nalso bosonic four-point loop graphs in the THDM, which have never been computed in\nthis context. Naturally, the MSSM also has additional four-point loops with virtual superpartners and, furthermore, even five-point (\"pentagon\") superpartner loops. Specifically,\nthere are triangle-, box- and pentagon-type loops involving neutralinos, gauginos and first\ngeneration sleptons.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the essential\nprocess kinematics, a complete list of Feynman graphs for the process in the MSSM and\nthe THDM, and a description of the approximations which have been used so far in previous\ncalculations of this process. Section 3 contains numerical results for the total cross section\nof e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 e+ \u03bde + (c.c.) for two interesting MSSM sample scenarios. In this section, we\ndemonstrate when certain approximations describe the complete MSSM result reasonably\nwell and when (and how badly) they fail to do so. Our conclusions follow in Section 4.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 e+\u03bde in the MSSM and THDM\n\n2.1\n\nKinematics\n\nWe study the reaction\ne+ (k, \u03bb) + e\u2212 (q, \u03bb\u0304) \u2192 H \u2212 (p) + e+ (k \u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) + \u03bde (q \u2032 ) ,\nwhere k and q denote the momenta of the initial-state positron and electron, q \u2032 and k \u2032 the\nmomenta of the final-state neutrino and positron, and p the momentum of the final-state\nHiggs boson H \u2212 . Additionally, the electron and the positrons, are characterized by their\nspin polarization \u03bb, \u03bb\u0304, \u03bb\u2032 (= \u00b1 21 ).\nThe total unpolarized cross section can be written as an integral over a 4-fold differential\ncross section [12]:\n1\n\u03c3=\n4\n\nX\n\n\u03bb,\u03bb\u0304,\u03bb\u2032 =\u00b11/2\n\nZ\n\n\u20320\nkmax\n\ndk\n\n\u20320\n\nme\n\nZ\n\np0max\n\ndp\np0min\n\n0\n\ncos \u03b8max\n\nZ\n\nd cos \u03b8\n\ncos \u03b8min\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b7\n0\n\nd4 \u03c3\u03bb\u03bb\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n,\ndk \u20320 dp0 d cos \u03b8 d\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\nwith\ns \u2212 m2H \u00b1 + m2e\n\u221a\n,\n2 s\nm2 \u00b1\n\u221a H \u20320\n,\n\u03be=\ns \u2212 2 s k + m2e\n\n\u20320\nkmax\n=\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03be\n1+\u03be\n\u00b1 |~k \u2032 |\n,\np0max,min = ( s \u2212 k \u20320 )\n2\n2\ncos \u03b8max,min = \u00b11 \u2213 \u03b4 cos \u03b8cut .\n\nThe differential cross section is related to the squared matrix element |M\u03bb\u03bb\u0304\u03bb\u2032 |2 through\nd4 \u03c3\u03bb\u03bb\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n|M\u03bb\u03bb\u0304\u03bb\u2032 |2\np\n=\n.\ndk \u20320 dp0 d cos \u03b8 d\u03b7\n(4\u03c0)4 s 1 \u2212 4m2e /s\n\n(2)\n\nThe angle between the three-momentum of the in- and outgoing positron, \u03b8 is defined by\ncos \u03b8 =\n\n~k \u2032 * ~k\n,\n|~k \u2032 ||~k|\n\n(3)\n\nand \u03b7 is the angle between the plane spanned by the three-momenta of the three final-state\nparticles and a plane perpendicular to the beam axis.\nIn order to have a realistic scenario concerning the detectability of the outgoing positron,\nwe employ an angular cut-off \u03b4 cos \u03b8cut = 10\u22123 . This cuts off all final state positrons which\nscatter with an angle less than 44.7 mrad to the beam axis. This choice is inspired by the\nTESLA Detector Technical Design Report [13] where a detection of electrons and positrons\ndown to 4.6 mrad is foreseen, but with angles below 30 mrad only used for luminosity\nmonitoring.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nFeynman graphs\n\nIn the MSSM and THDM the tree-level amplitude for the process under study contains the\nH \u2212 e+ \u03bde Yukawa coupling, which is \u221d me /mW \u2248 6 * 10\u22126 . Thus, the tree-level contribution\nis strongly suppressed and can be neglected. The process can be called effectively loopinduced. In our calculation we take into account all one-loop contributions to the amplitude\nwhich do not vanish in the limit me = 0. For this reason, Feynman graphs with an\ninsertion of an s-channel Z \u2212 A mixing self-energy, or a t-channel neutrino self-energy,\nand the radiative corrections to e+ e\u2212 {h0 , H 0 , A0 } Yukawa couplings and large parts to the\ne\u00b1 \u03bde H \u2213 Yukawa coupling need not be considered. In the MSSM, there is a contribution\nto the e\u00b1 \u03bde H \u2213 Yukawa coupling which involves virtual charginos or neutralinos which is\nfinite and does not vanish for me = 0. Those contributions are taken into account in our\ncalculation.\nThe Feynman graphs of the MSSM loop contributions can be divided into\n\u2022 graphs with W \u2212 \u2013H \u2212 and G\u2212 \u2013H \u2212 mixing self-energies on the external H \u2212 line (see\nFig.1),\n\u2022 graphs with the loop-induced \u03b3W + H \u2212 or ZW + H \u2212 vertex (see Fig.1),\n\u2022 graphs with the non-vanishing part of the e+ \u03bde H \u2212 vertex (see Fig.2),\n\u2022 box-type graphs (see Figs. 3 and 4),\n\u2022 pentagon-type graphs (see Fig.5).\nThe self-energy and vertex insertions depicted in Fig.1 consist of closed loops of fermions\nand sfermions, loops with gauge and Higgs bosons, and loops with electroweak gauginos\nand sfermions. 3\nIn the literature there have been several approximations adopted to simplify the calculations as a complete calculation in the MSSM requires the calculation of pentagon graphs.\nBelow, we define the typical approximations and to what subset of Feynman graphs they\ncorrespond to.\nFermion/Sfermion Approximation : Only closed loops with fermions or sfermions are\nincluded in the calculation. For the THDM part of the amplitude this approximation\nmeans neglecting all bosonic loops. The superpartner part of the amplitude comprises\nthe set of graphs analogous to the fermion loop amplitudes, with fermions replaced\nby sfermions plus some additional related ones involving 4-point interactions with\nsfermions. Such an approximation can be justified in scenarios where the masses\nof the third-generation sfermions (especially squarks) lie well below the masses of\nslepton and electroweak gaugino masses which appear in all the neglected graphs\n(see Figs. 2, 4 and 5) and provide additional mass suppression factors.\n3\n\nThe Feynman graphs for these insertions can be found e.g. in [6].\n\n4\n\n\fsTHDM : No superpartner graphs are included in the calculation. This subset of graphs\ncorresponds to the full THDM with the Higgs sector parameters chosen according\nto the corresponding MSSM scenario. It is usually a useful approximation to the\nfull MSSM result in parameter scenarios where all superpartners are rather heavy\ncompared to the SM particles.\nHeavy Fermion Approximation : Only the loops with third generation fermions are\ntaken into account. This approximation consists of all THDM terms proportional\nto the usually dominant third generation Yukawa couplings and neglects the bosonic\nloops of Fig. 3. In the literature, this approximation is usually further simplified\nby only taking the loops with top and bottom quarks into account. In the present\ncalculation, we also include the loops involving tau leptons which has a small but\nnoticeable effect on the results.\n\n2.3\n\nCalculation\n\nAlthough the tree-level contribution vanishes in the limit of vanishing electron mass, which\nwe consider, the need for renormalization arises at one-loop. In the gauge and Higgs boson\nsector there are divergent off-diagonal propagator entries leading to H \u00b1 \u2013W \u00b1 and H \u00b1 \u2013G\u00b1\nmixing and, connected to this, the one-loop \u03b3W \u00b1 H \u2213 and ZW \u00b1 H \u2213 vertex functions are\ndivergent too (see Fig. 1). We use the on-shell renormalization scheme of Ref. [14], the\napplication of which to the present situation is discussed e.g. in [4, 5, 6]. In this scheme\nthe renormalization conditions relevant to our calculation are the following.\n\u2022 Renormalized tadpole graphs for the neutral CP-even Higgs bosons, h0 , H 0 , vanish:\nt\u0302h0 = th0 + \u03b4th0 = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nt\u0302H 0 = tH 0 + \u03b4tH 0 = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nThis guarantees that the parameters v1 , v2 in the renormalized Lagrangian describe\nthe minimum of the Higgs potential at one-loop order.\n\u2022 Physical charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 do not mix with longitudinally polarized W \u00b1\nbosons, i.e. the real part of the renormalized H \u00b1 \u2013W \u2213 mixing self-energy4 ,\n\u03a3\u0302HW (k 2 ) = \u03a3HW (k 2 ) \u2212 m2W \u03b4ZHW ,\n\n(6)\n\nvanishes if the momentum k of H \u00b1 is on mass-shell:\nRe \u03a3\u0302HW (k 2 )\n\nk 2 =m2\n\nH\u00b1\n\n= 0.\n\n(7)\n\u03bc\n\nThe renormalized H \u00b1 \u2013W \u00b1 mixing self-energy is defined as the coefficient of \u2212i mkW of the amputated\nrenormalized H \u00b1 \u2013W \u00b1 propagator.\n4\n\n5\n\n\fConditions (4) and (5) amount to neglecting all Feynman graphs with tadpoles in our\ncalculation.

In particular, we made use of the numerical\nroutines for the evaluation of the 5-point loop-integrals implemented in LoopTools 2.2 [17]\nemploying the methods of [18]. For our purpose, we extended the existing FeynArts model\nfile for the MSSM by including the necessary counter-term definitions and Feynman rules\nfor the counter-term interactions.\nA subclass of Feynman graphs corresponds to the production of a charged Higgs boson\nH \u2212 in association with a virtual W + and its subsequent decay into e+ \u03bde . Those graphs\ncan become resonant which requires to take the width of the W -boson into account. We\nhave chosen the finite width scheme and have introduced a constant finite width \u0393W by\nreplacing in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge:\n\u2212ig \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212ig \u03bc\u03bd\n.\n\u2192 2\np2 \u2212 m2W\np \u2212 m2W + imW \u0393W\n6\n\n\f3\n\nResults\n\n3.1\n\nParameter scenarios\n\nWe pick the MSSM parameter scenarios from [6] which are partly modifications from the\nLEP Higgs search benchmark scenarios [19]: the mmax\nscenario with a lower sfermion mass\nh\nscale and the small-\u03b1eff scenario. This will allow us to re-use parts of the discussion of the\nbehaviour of \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W \u00b1 H \u2213 ) in those scenarios from [6]. The two MSSM parameter\nscenarios are specified as follows:\nmmax\nh (400) scenario: The soft-breaking sfermion mass parameter is set to Mf \u0303 = 400 GeV.\nThe off-diagonal term Xt (= At \u2212 \u03bc cot \u03b2) in the top-squark mass matrix is set\nto 2Mf \u0303 (= 800 GeV) The Higgsino and gaugino mass parameters have the settings\n\u03bc = \u2212200 GeV, M1 = M2 = 200 GeV, Mg\u0303 = 800 GeV. When tan \u03b2 is changed, At\nis changed accordingly to ensure Xt = 2Mf \u0303. The settings of the other soft-breaking\nscalar-quark Higgs couplings are Ab = At and Af = 0 (f = e, \u03bc, \u03c4, u, d, c, s).\nsmall-\u03b1eff scenario: This scenario gives rise to suppressed branching ratios for the decays\nh0 \u2192 bb\u0304 and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , especially for large tan \u03b2 and moderate values of mA . The settings\nare: Mf \u0303 = 800 GeV, Xt = \u22121100 GeV, M1 = M2 = 500 GeV, \u03bc = 2000 GeV. Also\nhere, At is changed if tan \u03b2 changes in order to keep the value of Xt fixed, Ab = At\nand Af = 0 (f = e, \u03bc, \u03c4, u, d, c, s).\nThe resulting masses of the Higgs bosons and the relevant superpartner particles for these\nparameter choices are given in Table 1.\n\n3.2\n\nCross sections\n\nWe present results for the cross section of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 (H + e\u2212 \u03bd\u0304e , H \u2212 e+ \u03bde ) assuming\nunpolarized beams5 and a collider energy of 1 TeV. Assuming the collider would accumulate\n1000 events/fb of integrated luminosity, a cross section of 0.05 fb would result in 50 expected\nevents. This can be taken as a reasonable lower limit for the observability of a particular\ndiscovery channel and is often not reached in our sample scenarios. However, our aim here\nis not primarily phenomenology but to clarify the relationship between different commonly\nused approximations and the complete MSSM result. Specifically, we show cross section\nresults for the mmax\nh (400) scenario (Figs. 6a, 6c, 7a, 7c) and the small-\u03b1eff scenario (Figs. 6b,\n6d, 7b, 7d) and demonstrate when certain approximations describe the complete result\nreasonably well and when (and how badly) they fail to do so.\nFrom the analysis of the related process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u00b1 W \u2213 [6], we expect that the cross section can be\nup to a factor of 4 higher than in the unpolarized case, if optimal polarization of the e\u2212 and e+ beams is\nassumed.\n5\n\n7\n\n\fmmax\nsmall-\u03b1eff scenario\nh (400) scenario\ntan \u03b2 = 5\ntan \u03b2 = 30\ntan \u03b2 = 5\ntan \u03b2 = 30\n\u00b1\nHiggs masses for mH = 250 [500] GeV\nmh0 [GeV] 115.5 [116.9] 122.1 [122.0] 113.6 [113.9] 119.9 [119.2]\nmH 0 [GeV] 240.7 [494.7] 232.3 [491.3] 237.2 [493.1] 234.0 [492.1]\nmA0 [GeV] 237.1 [493.5] 232.6 [492.2] 238.9 [494.4] 238.3 [494.4]\nStau, sbottom and stop masses\nm\u03c4\u03031 [GeV]\n398.5\n387.3\n789.2\n730.5\nm\u03c4\u03032 [GeV]\n406.3\n417.3\n813.0\n866.3\nmb\u03031 [GeV]\n391.9\n360.7\n769.2\n596.0\nmb\u03032 [GeV]\n412.7\n440.5\n832.0\n963.8\nmt\u03031 [GeV]\n224.4\n224.0\n692.0\n691.9\nmt\u03032 [GeV]\n569.7\n569.6\n925.2\n925.1\nChargino and neutralino masses\nm\u03c7\u00b11 [GeV]\n166.3\n153.5\n497.8\n498.9\nm\u03c7\u00b12 [GeV]\n255.5\n263.4\n2003.8\n2003.5\nm\u03c701 [GeV]\n93.9\n89.8\n236.8\n237.1\nm\u03c702 [GeV]\n163.8\n154.9\n497.8\n498.9\nm\u03c703 [GeV]\n215.1\n211.9\n2001.1\n2001.6\nm\u03c704 [GeV]\n252.4\n262.1\n2003.7\n2002.9\nTable 1: Masses of the Higgs bosons, the most tan \u03b2-sensitive sfermions, charginos and\nneutralinos for the two sample scenarios and different values of tan \u03b2 and mH \u00b1 . All other\nsfermion masses are equal to Mf \u0303 within \u00b12%.\n3.2.1\n\nmmax\n(400) scenario\nh\n\nThe mmax\nh (400) scenario has rather light squarks, neutralinos and charginos compared\nto the assumed collider energy of 1 TeV. Therefore, all these particles can contribute\nsignificantly to the amplitude of the process. Especially, there are enhanced couplings of\nthird-generation squarks to the charged Higgs bosons.\nIn Fig. 6a, we show the integrated cross section as a function of charged Higgs mass,\nmH \u00b1 , for tan \u03b2 = 30. Depending on mH \u00b1 , the cross section prediction of the full MSSM\n(solid line) can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than of the sTHDM (dotted\nline). For rather large mH \u00b1 , between 550 GeV and 750 GeV, the cross section experiences\nthreshold enhancement basically through stop\u2013sbottom loop graphs, which dominate the\namplitude in this region, as has been noted for the related process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W \u00b1 H \u2213 in\n[6]. Naturally, in this region, the Fermion/Sfermion approximation used in [11] comes\nquite close to the full MSSM prediction. For mH \u00b1 below 550 GeV this approximation\nceases to be a good approximation to the full MSSM. Away from the region where the\nloop graphs with stops and sbottoms dominate, the ones with neutralinos and charginos\n\n8\n\n\fbecome relevant as well and lead to a cross section more than twice as large as in the\nFermion/Sfermion approximation.\nThe Heavy Fermion approximation works well as an approximation to the sTHDM\nfor mH \u00b1 above the threshold mH \u00b1 = mt + mb in top\u2013bottom loops up to about 500 GeV\nwhere the full sTHDM amplitude starts to experience enhancement from box-type Feynman\ngraphs which consist of loops with virtual gauge and Higgs bosons (see Fig 3). Around the\npeak of this effect, at mH \u00b1 \u2248 640 GeV, the full sTHDM result lies almost a factor of two\nabove the Heavy Fermion approximation. But also for low mH \u00b1 (. 150 GeV), the result\nin the full sTHDM is about 15% larger than in the Heavy Fermion approximation.\nIn Fig. 6c, we show the integrated cross section as a function of charged Higgs mass,\nmH \u00b1 , for tan \u03b2 = 5. For small tan \u03b2 the difference between the full MSSM and the\nFermion/Sfermion approximation becomes less dramatic than in the high-tan \u03b2 case. However, there is, for all displayed mH \u00b1 , a clear difference between the two results, the full\nMSSM lying between \u221213% to \u221250% below the approximation. The sTHDM result agrees\nperfectly with the Heavy Fermion approximation and both agree quite good with the\nFermion/Sfermion approximation, except for mH \u00b1 between 600 and 700 GeV, which is the\nregion of stop\u2013sbottom thresholds. Unlike in the high tan \u03b2 case, there is no peak but a\ndip, which is also quite similar to the findings for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u00b1 W \u2213 [6].\nThe Figures 7a and 7c show the tan \u03b2 dependence of the cross section for mH \u00b1 =\n250 GeV and 500 GeV respectively. The case mH \u00b1 = 250 GeV is particularly interesting, as it lies exactly in the area of Fig. 6a where even the pentagon-type graphs make a\nnoticeable contribution to the amplitude. We see again that the Fermion/Sfermion approximation does not describe the full MSSM well. For mH \u00b1 = 250 [500] GeV it deviates by\nabout +30% [40%] for small tan \u03b2 and \u221250% [\u221223%] for large tan \u03b2. The Heavy Fermion\napproximation comes quite close to the full sTHDM result, except for the large tan \u03b2 region\nfor mH \u00b1 = 500 GeV which is where the box amplitudes become enhanced as noted above.\nHowever, there is no place in the displayed scenarios where the Heavy Fermion approximation is a reasonable approximation to the full MSSM, except for very small tan \u03b2 (say\ntan \u03b2 < 2) and, accidentally, at a cross-over point around tan \u03b2 = 10.\n3.2.2\n\nsmall-\u03b1eff scenario\n\nIn the small-\u03b1eff scenario, all the sfermion thresholds in the amplitude lie well above 1 TeV\nand the lowest chargino\u2013neutralino threshold lies above 700 GeV. Hence, the superpartner\neffects in this scenario are a bit milder than in the previous one. However, once the mass\nscale mH \u00b1 approaches the level of the sfermion mass scales, stop\u2013sbottom loop graphs can\nstill lead to large effects if tan \u03b2 is large.\nIn Figures 6b and 6d we show the integrated cross section as a function of mH \u00b1 for\ntan \u03b2 = 30 and 5, respectively. For large tan \u03b2 (see Fig. 6b) there is no point where\nthe Heavy Fermion approximation is a good approximation to the full MSSM result. This\ncan only be possible for scenarios with a superpartner mass scale considerably higher than\n800 GeV. However, for the most part the Fermion/Sfermion approximation works reasonably well to describe the full MSSM and the Heavy Fermion approximation likewise\n9\n\n\fto describe the full THDM. An exception is the low charged Higgs mass region around\nmH \u00b1 . 300 GeV where the gauge and Higgs boson loops, which are neglected in both approximations (i.e. also in all previous calculations of this process), contribute significantly,\nraising the full MSSM and sTHDM result by up to \u2248 50% compared to their approximations. For small tan \u03b2 (see Fig. 6d) the Fermion/Sfermion approximation reproduces the\nfull MSSM result over the whole displayed range within at most \u00b110% and the agreement\nbetween the Heavy Fermion approximation and the sTHDM is similar. Yet, the MSSM\nresult is usually larger than the sTHDM result, up to about 30%.\nThe tan \u03b2 dependence of the cross section, shown in Figs. 7b and 7d for mH \u00b1 = 250 GeV\nand 500 GeV respectively, merely underline the statements above.\n3.2.3\n\nThe pentagon contribution\n\nSo far, not many MSSM processes which include pentagon-type Feynman graphs of superpartners have been studied. Therefore, a closer look at this part of the amplitude seems to\nbe on order. Although the main contribution of the pentagon graphs to the cross section\nof the full MSSM comes from the interference of those graphs with the remainder of the\nMSSM amplitude, we will study here the cross section obtained from squaring the pentagon\ngraphs alone for clarity.\nIn Fig. 8a we show this cross section as a function of mH \u00b1 for all the parameter scenarios\nwe studied above. For tan \u03b2 = 30 in the mmax\nh (400) scenario we see threshold peaks for\nmH \u00b1 \u2248 m\u03c7\u00b1i +m\u03c70j for some but not all combinations of i and j, depending on the couplings\nand mixing matrices of the charginos and neutralinos. For mH \u00b1 in the vicinity of the lowest\nthreshold, m\u03c7\u00b11 +m\u03c701 = 243.3 GeV, one even gets a noticeable contribution to the full result.\nIn the small-\u03b1eff scenario the same threshold lies around 740 GeV (see Fig. 8a), but in this\ncase the pentagon contribution is way to small to influence the numerical value of the cross\nsection significantly.\nThe tan \u03b2 dependence of the \"pentagon-only\" cross section is displayed in Fig. 8b. The\ncase of mH \u00b1 = 250 GeV in the mmax\nh (400) scenario shows the most interesting behaviour.\nThe cross section rises by more than an order of magnitude with tan \u03b2 going through a\npeak around tan \u03b2 = 10. The reason for this is, that the neutralino and chargino masses\ndepend slightly on tan \u03b2 and the sum m\u03c7\u00b11 + m\u03c701 passes through the value 250 GeV around\ntan \u03b2 = 10. The value of m\u03c7\u00b11 + m\u03c701 changes quickly for small tan \u03b2 and reaches a plateau\nvalue close to 250 GeV for high tan \u03b2. This is why the cross section reaches a plateau for\nhigh tan \u03b2 as well.\nIn our sample scenarios, the MSSM is usually well approximated by neglecting the\npentagon graphs, except for the threshold enhancement situations mentioned above. In\nMSSM scenarios with higher masses for the charginos, neutralinos and sleptons than in\nour sample scenarios, with no thresholds within the reach of the collider, this statement\nshould hold without exception.\nNeglecting the pentagon graphs in such scenarios is then also quite time saving from\na computational point of view. The inclusion of the pentagons graphs adds 1216 distinct\n5-point integrals to the amplitude to be calculated and the evaluation of those uses the\n10\n\n\freduction of each 5-point integral to five 4-point integrals. This has to be contrasted to\nonly 52 distinct 4-point integrals to be calculated for the amplitude without pentagons.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented the first complete one-loop calculation of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 e+ \u03bde +\n(c.c.) in both the THDM and MSSM. We have examined the differences that arise in using\nthe various approximations which have been used in calculations of this process previously\nas outlined in Section 2.2. We find that in the small-\u03b1eff scenario, that cross sections\ncomputed in the Fermion/Sfermion approximation are comparable to those computed in\nthe full MSSM while cross sections computed in the Heavy Fermion approximation are\ncomparable to those computed in the full THDM. However, these approximations simply\nfail for the mmax\n(400) scenario. The reason is that in this scenario the virtual particles\nh\nin the loops have lower masses which is why their contribution to the amplitude cannot\nbe neglected. We further point out that cross sections computed in the Heavy Fermion\napproximation for both scenarios usually disagree completely with cross sections computed\nin the MSSM, except for very low tan \u03b2.\nFor our sample scenarios we explicitly show that the pentagon graphs in the MSSM\nusually contribute negligibly to the total cross section. The MSSM is well approximated\nin the small-\u03b1eff scenario by neglecting the pentagon graphs. This is also true for the\nmmax\n(400) scenario except in threshold regions.\nh\n\nAcknowledgements\nWork supported in part by the European Community's Marie-Curie Research Training Network under contract MRTN-CT-2006-035505 'Tools and Precision Calculations for Physics\nDiscoveries at Colliders'.\n\nReferences\n[1] W.
