We have measured an optical transition frequency at 688 THz\nin 171 Yb+ with a cesium atomic clock at two times separated by 2.8 years and find a value for\nthe fractional variation of the frequency ratio fYb /fCs of (\u22121.2 \u00b1 4.4) * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 , consistent with\nzero.

Variations of\nthe constants have been searched for in various contexts\n[2, 3]. Sommerfeld's fine structure constant \u03b1 is presently\nthe most important test case. As a dimensionless quantity, \u03b1 \u2243 1/137 can be determined without reference to\na specific system of units. This point is important because the realization of the units themselves may also be\naffected by variations of the constants.\nThe only indication for a possible variation of \u03b1 so far\ncomes from an apparent shift of wavelengths of specific\nabsorption lines produced by interstellar clouds in the\nlight from distant quasars [4]. These observations seem\nto suggest that about 1010 yr ago the value of \u03b1 was\nsmaller than today: \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22120.54\u00b10.12)*10\u22125 over the\nredshift range 0.2 < z < 3.7, representing 4.7\u03c3 evidence\nfor a varying \u03b1 [5]. Assuming a linear increase in \u03b1 with\ntime, this would correspond to a drift rate \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t =\n(6.4\u00b11.4)*10\u221216 yr\u22121 [5]. Recent evaluations of new data\non quasar absorption lines are consistent with \u2206\u03b1 = 0\n[6]. A stringent limit on the order of |\u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t| < 1 *\n10\u221217 yr\u22121 for the temporal variability of \u03b1 has been\ndeduced from the analysis of a natural nuclear reactor\nthat was active 2*109 years ago in the Oklo region in West\nAfrica [2, 7]. Since this analysis is based on the energy of\na neutron capture resonance, it is not possible to separate\nthe influence of a variable fine structure constant from\npossible variations of the coupling constants of the strong\ninteraction and of nuclear masses. In unified theories the\ndrift rates of these parameters are correlated and it has\n\nbeen predicted that nuclear masses and moments may\nshow significantly higher relative drift rates than \u03b1 [8, 9,\n10]. In this sense the limit on \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t from the Oklo\nreactor has to be regarded as model-dependent [11].\nIn this letter we report a model-independent limit for\nthe present temporal variation of \u03b1 from comparisons\nof atomic frequency standards. We reach a sensitivity\nfor \u2206\u03b1/\u2206t with \u2206t \u2248 3 yr that approaches that of the\nquasar observations [5, 6] if a linear change of \u03b1 is assumed over a cosmological time span. Possible systematic errors can usually be identified more easily in laboratory experiments than in astrophysical or geophysical observations. Precise frequency comparisons have\nrecently been performed in order to constrain temporal\nderivatives of fundamental constants [12, 13] (see also [2]\nand references therein). Since these measurements involve hyperfine frequencies, they are sensitive not only\nto a variation of \u03b1, but also to a variation of the nuclear\nmagnetic moment. In this case a limit on the variability\nof \u03b1 could only be obtained under the assumption that\nthe nuclear properties stay constant, which is difficult to\njustify.\nTo avoid the influence of nuclear structure and to obtain a direct measure of the drift rate of \u03b1 one can compare different optical electronic transition frequencies. So\nfar, sufficiently accurate atomic optical frequency standards have not been operated continuously over extended\nperiods of time, but a number of precise frequency measurements have been performed with reference to cesium\nclocks. For the analysis, we assume that the electronic\ntransition frequency can be expressed as\nf = Ry * C * F (\u03b1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ry = me e4 /(8\u01eb20 h3 ) \u2243 3.2898 * 1015 Hz is the Rydberg constant in SI units of frequency, appearing here\nas the common atomic scaling factor (me : electron mass;\n\n\f2\ne: elementary charge; \u01eb0 : electric constant; h: Planck's\nconstant). C is a numerical constant which depends only\non the quantum numbers characterizing the atomic state\nand is assumed not to vary in time. F (\u03b1) is a dimensionless function of \u03b1 that takes into account level shifts due\nto relativistic effects [14, 15]. In many-electron atoms\nthese effects lead to different sensitivities of the transition frequencies to a change of \u03b1, with the general trend\nto find a stronger dependence in heavier atoms, as was\nfirst pointed out in [16]. The relative temporal derivative\nof the frequency f can be written as\n\u2202 ln Ry\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n\u2202 ln f\n=\n+A*\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\nwith A \u2261\n\n\u2202 ln F\n. (2)\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n\nThe first term \u2202 ln Ry/\u2202t represents a variation that\nwould be common to all measurements of electronic transition frequencies: a change of the numerical value of the\nRydberg constant in SI units, i.e. with respect to the\n133\nCs hyperfine splitting. We distinguish here between\nthe numerical value of Ry and the physical parameter\nwhich determines the atomic energy scale. A change of\nthe latter would not be detectable in this type of measurement because the 133 Cs hyperfine splitting is also proportional to this quantity. Consequently, the detection of a\nnonzero value of \u2202 ln Ry/\u2202t would have to be interpreted\nas being due to a change of the cesium hyperfine interval,\nand in particular of the 133 Cs nuclear magnetic moment.\nThe second term in Eq. 2 is specific to the atomic transition under study. The value of the sensitivity factor A\nfor small changes of \u03b1 has been calculated for a number\nof cases by Dzuba et al. [14, 15]. Assuming that possible drifts of the atomic frequencies are linear in time\nover the period of interest, the drift rate \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t can be\nobtained from at least two measured drift rates of transition frequencies \u2202 ln f /\u2202t if the sensitivity factors A for\nthe two transitions are different. A plot of \u2202 ln f /\u2202t as a\nfunction of A should yield a straight line where the slope\nis determined by \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t and a drift of Ry would show\nup in the intercept [10].\nOptical transition frequencies can be measured very\nprecisely in single trapped and laser-cooled ions [17] because here perturbations that may lead to systematic frequency shifts can be controlled very effectively. These\nexperiments are well suited for a laboratory search for\na variation of \u03b1 because transitions in heavy ions like\nYb+ or Hg+ cover a wide range of A values [14, 15].\nAt PTB an optical frequency standard based on 171 Yb+\nis investigated [18, 19]. A single ytterbium ion is\ntrapped in a miniature Paul trap and is laser-cooled to a\nsub-millikelvin temperature by exciting the 2 S1/2 (F =\n1) \u2192 2 P1/2 (F = 0) resonance transition at 370 nm.\nTwo additional lasers at wavelengths of 935 nm and\n639 nm are used to repump the ion from the metastable\n2\nD3/2 (F = 1) and 2 F7/2 levels that may be populated\nduring the cooling phase.

The isotope 171 Yb\nhas a nuclear spin quantum number of 1/2 so that a\n(F = 0, mF = 0) \u2192 (F = 2, mF = 0) component of the\nreference transition with vanishing linear Zeeman shift is\navailable (Fig. 1a). The reference transition is probed\nby the frequency-doubled radiation from a diode laser\nemitting at 871 nm. The short-term frequency stability\nof this laser is derived from a high-finesse, temperaturestabilized and seismically isolated reference cavity. The\ntrapped ion is interrogated using the electron shelving\nscheme [17] with alternating cooling and probe laser\npulses. A Fourier-limited linewidth of 10 Hz at 688 THz\nand a resonant excitation probability of about 50% is obtained (Fig. 1b). The probe laser frequency is stabilized\nto the atomic reference frequency in a servo system with\na time constant of \u2248 10 s. We have observed a fractional\ninstability well below 1 * 10\u221215 for an averaging time of\n1000 s. In order to minimize servo errors due to the drift\nof the probe laser frequency (in the range of 0.2 Hz/s), a\nsecond-order integrating algorithm is used.\nThe frequency of the 688 THz 171 Yb+ standard was\nmeasured relative to PTB's primary cesium fountain\nclock [20]. A hydrogen maser is referenced to the cesium\nclock and delivers a signal at 100 MHz with an instability\nbelow 2 * 10\u221215 in 1000 s of averaging. The link between\nthe maser signal and the optical frequency is established\nwith a femtosecond-laser frequency comb generator [21].\nThe result of a first series of measurements starting on\nMJD 51889 was 688 358 979 309 312 Hz with a total 1\u03c3\nmeasurement uncertainty of 6 Hz [22]. The frequency\nwas remeasured around MJD 52947 after improvements\nin the resolution of the ionic resonance and in the frequency comb generator setup. The new value has a total\n1\u03c3 uncertainty of 6.2 Hz (see below) and is insignificantly\nlower by 2.3 Hz (see Fig. 2). From these measurements\nwe deduce a value for the fractional variation of fYb /fCs\n\n\f3\nof (\u22121.2 \u00b1 4.4) * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 .\n\nfYb- 688 358 979 309 312 [Hz]\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n51850\n\n51900\n\n51950\n\n52950\n\n53000\n\nTime [days in MJD]\n\nFIG. 2: Results of absolute frequency measurements of the\n171\nYb+ standard versus the date of the measurement (MJD:\nModified Julian Date).\n\nThe dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the\nYb+ 688 THz optical frequency standard is the socalled quadrupole shift, i.e., the shift of the atomic transition frequency due to the interaction of the electric\nquadrupole moment of the D3/2 state with the gradient\nof the static electric field at the trap center. Such a field\ngradient may be produced by patch charges on the trap\nelectrodes and a sensitivity of the transition frequency to\nfield gradients of up to 6 Hz/(V/mm2 ) is expected [19].\nA static field gradient also leads to modifications of the\noscillation frequencies of the ion in the trap and an analysis of this effect indicates that patch field gradients in\nour trap are smaller than 0.5 V/mm2 . Other systematic\nfrequency shifts are well below 1 Hz and their contribution to the uncertainty is negligible at present: The\nstatic magnetic field in the trap is typically 1 \u03bcT during\nthe interrogation of the reference transition, leading to a\nquadratic Zeeman shift of 0.06 Hz. The quadratic Stark\nshift due to blackbody radiation emitted from the trap\nelectrodes at room temperature is calculated as \u22120.4 Hz.\nIn the absence of a full evaluation, we use an estimate\nof 3.2 Hz for the systematic uncertainty of the 171 Yb+\nfrequency standard, dominated by the contribution from\nthe quadrupole shift. Frequency comparisons between\ntwo Yb+ ions in two separate traps showed agreement at\nthe sub-hertz level [19]. The total uncertainty of 6.2 Hz\n(corresponding to a relative uncertainty of 9 * 10\u221215 ) contains also a systematic contribution of 2.2 Hz from the\nmicrowave reference and frequency comb generator and\na total statistical contribution of 4.8 Hz.\nTo obtain the limit on \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t we combine the data\nfrom 171 Yb+ with a published limit on the drift rate\nof a transition frequency in 199 Hg+ [13]. The mercury\nion is investigated as an optical frequency standard at\nNIST (Boulder, USA). The transition 5d10 6s 2 S1/2 \u2192\n5d9 6s2 2 D5/2 at 282 nm (1065 THz) serves as the reference. A first frequency measurement of this transition was published in 2001 with a relative uncertainty of\n9 * 10\u221215 [23]. A sequence of measurements over a period\n171\n\nof two years has resulted in a constraint on the fractional\nvariation of fHg /fCs at the level of 7 * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 (1\u03c3)\n[13].\nThe transition frequencies of the ytterbium and of the\nmercury ion are the two most accurately known optical frequencies and their sensitivities to changes of \u03b1 are\nquite different [24]: AYb = 0.88 [15] and AHg = \u22123.19\n[14]. Since the uncertainties of these numbers are not\ngiven explicitly, we treat them as being exact, noting\nthat changes within 10% would modify our results only\nmarginally. Combining the two measurements in a search\nfor a temporal variability of \u03b1 is well justified: The\nHg+ observations cover the time between MJD 51770\nand MJD 52580 so that there is a significant temporal\noverlap. The cesium fountains of NIST and of PTB have\nbeen compared repeatedly during the relevant period and\nfound to be in agreement to within their evaluated uncertainties of 1.0 * 10\u221215 [20].\nA further precision test for the constancy of an optical\ntransition frequency was recently presented by Fischer\net al. who measured the 1S \u2192 2S transition frequency\nin atomic hydrogen in two periods around MJD 51360\nand MJD 52680, using a transportable cesium fountain\nfrequency standard [25]. The limit on the fractional drift\nrate for the hydrogen frequency that is deduced from\nthese experiments is (\u22123.2 \u00b1 6.3) * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 [25] with\nAH being zero.\nThe three limits on the frequency drift rates are consistent with a linear dependence on A, as assumed in Eq.\n2 (see Fig. 3a). Through a weighted linear regression we\nobtain from the slope of the fit:\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n= (\u22120.3 \u00b1 2.0) * 10\u221215 yr\u22121\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nfor the present value of the temporal derivative of the\nfine structure constant at the confidence level of 1\u03c3. Using only the data points from the single-ion experiments\nwith Hg+ and Yb+ one finds only a marginal change of\nthe result: \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t = (\u22120.2 \u00b1 2.0) * 10\u221215 yr\u22121 . This\nlimit is the result of a model-independent analysis that\nis not based on assumptions about correlations between\ndrift rates of different quantities and does not postulate\nthe drift rate of any quantity to be zero. To our knowledge, this is so far the most stringent limit on \u2202 ln \u03b1/\u2202t\nobtained from laboratory experiments. Another recent\nrelated analysis based on the data from hydrogen and\nmercury is presented in [25].\nThe intercept of the fitted straight line with the line\nA = 0 in Fig. 3a can be used to determine the drift rate\nof the numerical value of the Rydberg frequency Ry. This\nquantity is of great metrological importance. A nonzero\nvalue would imply among other consequences that a time\nscale generated with a cesium clock would not be uniform\nwith respect to other atomic oscillations. The result that\n\n\f4\nfrequencies [17]. The combination of results from different atomic and molecular frequency standards will make\nit possible to disentangle the contributions from the fundamental interactions and thus lead to sensitive tests of\nthe consequences of unification theories.\nWe thank S.

A\nsignificant deviation of the slope from zero would indicate a\nnonzero time derivative of the fine structure constant \u03b1. b)\nConstraints on the variability of \u03b1 and Ry as obtained from\nthe experimental points in (a).

Further improvements can be expected since trapped ions\nhave the potential to reach relative uncertainties in the\nrange of 10\u221218 for the comparison of optical transition\n\n[1] J. D.
