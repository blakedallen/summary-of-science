A first order melting transition of\nthe flux lattice is seen on increasing the temperature and/or the magnetic field. The phase diagram\nfor BSCCO is obtained for different values of the anisotropy parameter \u03b3. The best fit to the\nexperimental results of D. Majer et al. [Phys. Rev.

The flux penetrates the\nsample in the form of flux-lines (FL's), each containing a quantum unit \u03c60 = hc/2e of\nflux. At low temperature the FL's form an ordered hexagonal lattice (Abrikosov lattice)\nq\n\u221a\ndue to their their mutual repulsion. The lattice constant is given by a0 = 2\u03c60 / 3B,\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field flux density. At high temperature and/or magnetic field this\nlattice melts due to thermal fluctuations4,5,6,7,8 . Two of the most commonly used hightemperature superconductors are YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 (YBCO) and Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (BSCCO).\nThey are very different in one very important respect - their anisotropy parameter \u03b3, defined\n\nas \u03b3 2 = mz /m\u22a5 , where mz and m\u22a5 denote the effective masses of electrons moving along the\nc axis and the ab plane, respectively. While for YBCO the anisotropy is somewhere between\n5-7, for BSCCO it is estimated to be between 10 to a 100 times larger, and estimates vary\nacross the literature. What contributes to the discrepancy of different estimates is the fact\nthat the anisotropy varies depending on the degree of doping. There is also the question of\nhow to extract the value of anisotropy correctly from the exerimental results. Blatter et al2\ncite a range of anisotropies of 50-200 for BSCCO. References [7,9,10] cite values in the range\nof 140-160. However more recent acurate measurements11 the components of the London\npenetration depths \u03bbc and \u03bbab , the ratio of which is \u03b3, are consistent with anisotropy in the\nrange of 300-500 for optimally doped samples. The previously reported lower values may\nbelong to overdoped samples or constituted only a lower bound. Anisotropy controls the\namount of \"wiggling\" of a flux-line from plane to plane. In YBCO the FL's are more rigid\nwhile in BSCCO they are so loose that they are customarily referred to as a stack of two\ndimensional pancakes12 (or droplet vortices) rather than FL's.\nInteraction between two FL's in YBCO is non-local. It is a screened Bio-Savart type\nof interaction where each segment of a FL interacts with every other segment of the same\nFL and all the other FL's. For segments oriented in the same direction the interaction is\nrepulsive2 :\nZ\nexp(\u2212|si (z) \u2212 sj (z \u2032 )|/\u03bb)\n\u03b50 X\ndsi (z) * dsj (z \u2032 )\nF=\n2 ij\n|si (z) \u2212 sj (z \u2032 )|\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere si (z) denotes the position of the i'th FL at elevation z along the z-axis, \u03b50 = \u03c620 /(4\u03c0\u03bb)2\n2\n\n\fis the line energy and \u03bb is the screening length (penetration depth). Considering two given\nFL's, it turns out though that it is a good approximation to replace the non-local interaction\nof a given line segment of one FL, with all segments of the other FL with a single interaction\namong segments belonging to the same plane. This interaction is given approximately by13\n2 \u03b50 d K0 (Rij /\u03bb) where Rij is the distance between the two segments in the same plane and\nd is the thickness of each layer. The approximation is valid when the FL's do not deviate\ntoo much from straight lines which is a good approximation for YBCO in the \"solid\" vortex\nlattice phase, because FL's are stiff and do not wiggle too much. For each FL, there is also\nan elastic energy associated with its deviation from a straight line along the z-direction.\nThe elastic energy of a flux-line in YBCO is approximately given by\nZ\n\u01ebl L\ndz (dR(z)/dz)2 ,\n2 0\n\n(1.2)\n\nassuming the external magnetic field is aligned along the z-direction. The elastic coefficient\n(line tension) \u01ebl is equal to \u03b50 ln(\u03bb/\u03be)/\u03b3 2 where \u03be is the coherence length, and \u03b3 is the\nanisotropy. In the discrete case this self-energy transforms into an attractive quadratic\ninteraction between segments in adjacent planes. In this form the problem is equivalent to\na system of bosons with repulsive interactions13,14 . The term described in the last equation\ncorresponds to the kinetic energy of the bosons which repel each other with a screened\nCoulomb interaction.\nFor BSCCO the situation is different because each FL is represented more faithfully by a\ncollection of pancakes. Each pancake interacts with every other pancake, but the interaction\nis different from the interaction among FL segments discussed above. The interaction can\nbe shown to consist of two parts. The first part is called the electromagnetic interaction (or\nsimply magnetic) and it exists even in the case that the layers of the materials are completely\ndecoupled, so no current can flow along the c-axis of the sample. A pancake vortex located\nin one plane gives rise to screening currents in the same plane as well as in all other planes.\nA second pancake vortex, located elsewhere, interacts with the screening currents induced\nby the first pancake15 . This interaction has been calculated by Clem and others12 . Two\npancakes in the same plane interact with a repulsive interaction while pancakes in different\nplanes attract one another. If one considers a single pancake vortex and an infinite set\nof pancakes a distance R away stacked along the z-axis, then the interaction still sums to\n2 \u03b50 d K0 (R/\u03bb) in the limit when d/\u03bb goes to zero (see Appendix A). Clem12 proceeds to\n3\n\n\fshow that if one has a straight array of pancake vortices along the z-axis, and one pancake\nof the stack is displaced a distance R in the lateral direction then the magnetic energy of\nthe configuration increases by an amount\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\nd\u03c602\nR\nR\n\u2206E(R) = 2 2 C + ln\n+ K0\n.\n8\u03c0 \u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere C is Euler's constant (=0.5772...). For large R (R \u226b \u03bb), the modified Bessel function\nK0 decays exponentially and thus the energy increases like ln(R/\u03bb). For small R the Bessel\nfunction can be expanded in a power series in R/\u03bb\nK0 (R/\u03bb) = \u2212 ln(R/2\u03bb)(1 + R2 /4\u03bb2 + * * * ) \u2212 C + R2 (1 \u2212 C)/4\u03bb2 + * * * ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nand thus the electromagnetic energy behaves like R2 to leading order in R.\nThe second part of the interaction among pancake vortices is the so-called Josephson\ninteraction2,15,16 . It results from the fact that there is a Josephson current flowing between\ntwo superconductors separated by an insulator and this current is proportional to the sine\nof the phase difference of the superconducting wave functions. The superconductors in the\npresent case are the different CuO2 planes. When two pancakes belonging to the same\nstack and residing in adjacent planes move away from each other, the phase difference that\noriginates causes a Josephson current to begin flowing between the planes. This results in\nan attractive interaction between pancakes that for distances small compared to rg \u2261 \u03b3d is\napproximately quadratic2,15 in the distance. When the two adjacent pancakes are separated\n\nby a distance larger than rg , a \"Josephson string\" is formed, whose energy is proportional\nto its length16 .\nWhen the anisotropy is not too large, the Josephson coupling among adjacent pancakes,\nwhich are loosely belonging to the same \"flux-line\", dominates over the electromagnetic\ninteraction, and the later can be neglected. The ratio of the coefficients of the quadratic\nterms in the effective electromagnetic interaction (as mentioned above) and the Josephson\ninteraction goes roughly like \u03b3 2 (d/\u03bb)2 (where d/\u03bb \u223c 1/120 for BSCCO at T = 0 and even\nsmaller at higher temperatures). Thus for anisotropy \u03b3 = 50 we get a factor of 0.25 or less (a\nsomewhat more precise estimate17 gives a ratio of about 0.1). Thus the magnetic interaction\nis small compared to the Josephson interaction for anisotropies in the range of \u03b3 = 50 \u2212 100.\nFor samples with \u03b3 = 200 these interactions are already comparable. For large values of R\nthe magnetic interaction increases logarithmically and the Josephson interaction increases\n4\n\n\flinearly so the electromagnetic interaction is always negligible. The key to the estimate\ngiven above is to consider not just two pancake vortices but a whole line with one displaced\npancake. This argument is valid if the deviations of the vortices from straight lines are not\ntoo large. On the other hand, the electromagnetic interaction starts to be important for\nanisotropies which are significantly larger than \u03bb/d which for BSCCO is about 120.\nIt is the aim of this paper to include both the electromagnetic interaction and the Josephson interaction among pancakes and to see what is the combined effect on the phase diagram\nof the melting transition and the energy jump across the transition. The electromagnetic\ninteraction will be included fully in the sense that we will not make the approximation that\nthe pancake stacks are nearly straight and hence the electromagnetic coupling will not be\nreplaced by an in-plane effective coupling. Numerically, much of the past work on BSCCO\nhas been confined to the X-Y model19,20,21,22,23,24 and Bose model17,25 , both of them treat\nthe electromagnetic coupling imprecisely by including it as an effective in-plane interaction.\nRecently in several papers using the Langevin simulation method26,27,28 , the electromagnetic\ncoupling has been fully taken into account. Unfortunately, these papers completely neglect\nthe Josephson coupling which can hardly be justified. Also some of these papers work with a\nsmall system size like 5 to 10 planes along the z-direction, and some do not even use periodic\nboundary conditions in the z-direction. In this paper we carry out Monte Carlo simulations\nof a BSCCO system consisting of 20 \u2212 36 planes and periodic boundary conditions are used\nin all directions, including the z direction. Thus a pancake would interact with an infinite\nnumber of pancakes through the images under the periodic boundary conditions. For this\nan efficient way to sum over the interaction is required. We derive a formula for summing\nover the logarithmic interaction in Appendix B.\n\n5\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe starting point is the Lawrence-Doniach29 Gibbs free-energy functional,\n\u0012 (2)\n\u0013\nZ\n2\nX\n\u03b2\n\u2207\n~2\n2\u03c0 (2)\n2\n2\n4\nG[\u03c8n , a] =\ndR\n\u03b1|\u03c8n | + |\u03c8n | +\n\u03c8n\na\n+\n2\n2m\ni\n\u03c6\n0\nn\n!\n2\nZ (n+1)d\n2\n~\n2\u03c0i\n+\n\u03c8n+1 exp\ndz az \u2212 \u03c8n\n2Md2\n\u03c60 n d\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nZ\nb*H\nb\n2\n,\n+ d Rdz\n\u2212\n8\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03c8n represents the superconducting order parameter in the nth CuO2 layer, a(2) is\nthe vector potential in the plane, and d is the thickness of the insulating layers. b is the\nlocal magnetic field and H the externally applied field. The usual 3D integration of the GL\ntheory has been replaced by a summation over all the superconducting layers along with a\n2D integration over the superconducting planes. We set \u03c8n = |\u03c8n | exp(i\u03c6n ) and, working\n\nin the London approximation, we drop the term \u03b1|\u03c8n |2 + \u03b2|\u03c8n |4 /2 because it gives only a\n\nconstant contribution.

(2.4), (2.7) and (2.9) are to be solved with the appropriate boundary conditions and\nthe solution must be substituted back into Eq. (2.2) to obtain the Gibbs free-energy, and\nthus the strength of the interaction among pancake solutions. We also see that in the limit of\ninfinite anisotropy the right-hand-side of equations (2.7) and (2.9) tend to zero. An isolated\npancake residing in plane n is a singular solution of the equation for the phase of the wave\nfunction which satisfies\nn \u00d7 (R \u2212 Rn )\n,\n(2.10)\n(R \u2212 Rn )2\nwhere R is a two dimensional vector in the plane and Rn denotes the center of the pancake.\n\u2207(2) \u03c6n (R) = \u2212\n\nBy n we denote a unit vector in the z-direction. Thus as one fully encircles the pancake the\nphase \u03c6n changes by 2\u03c0, and is singular at the center of the pancake. In the case when the\nJosephson coupling is totally neglected, i.e. for \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the full solution of Eqs. (2.4), (2.7)\n\nand (2.9) can be found and from it one can easily obtain the magnetic-field in real space12 .\nIt is not a trivial matter to switch from the variables \u03c6n and a to pancake variables and\nexpress the free energy in terms of the latter. This transformation can only be implemented\napproximately. In the following we first summarize the known results for the Josephson\ninteraction and the electromagnetic interaction and then proceed to combine them together\ninto a single algorithm. Most papers consider only one type of interaction, Josephson or\nelectromagnetic in the limit that one dominates over the other.\n\nA.\n\nJosephson Coupling\n\nWe keep the same Josephson coupling as in Ref. 25. This coupling is strongly dependent\non the anisotropy parameter \u03b3. Consider two adjacent pancakes, belonging to the same FL,\n7\n\n\fresiding in the m and m + 1 planes respectively, such that their centers are displaced and\nnot located on top of each other. Assume that the pancake on the m + 2'th plane is located\non top of the m + 1-plane pancake, and the pancake residing in the m \u2212 1 plane is at the\nsame position as the m-plane pancake. Thus \u03c6m+1 6= \u03c6m but \u03c6m+2 = \u03c6m+1 and \u03c6m\u22121 = \u03c6m .\n\nThis assumption is made in order to trancate the infinite set of couples equations2 , and in\nreal situations may constitue an approximation. Denoting \u03a6m+1,m = \u03c6m+1 \u2212 \u03c6m simply by \u03a6\nwe see that writing down Eq. (2.9) for the m and m + 1 planes respectively and subtracting\none equation from the other, one obtains\n\u2206(2) \u03a6 =\n\n2\nsin(\u03a6),\nrg2\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere rg = \u03b3d is the relevant screening length of the problem. Note that the screening\nterm due to the vector potential has been neglected since it is negligible on length scales\nR \u223c rg \u226a \u03b3\u03bb. Equation (2.11) is the famous Sine Gordon Equation. Once its solution is\nobtained, it needs to be substituted in the Lawrence-Doniach Gibbs free-energy. This results\nin a contribution of the form30\nd\u03b50\nGJ = 2\n\u03c0rg\n\nZ\n\nd2 R\u2032 [1 \u2212 cos(\u03a6(R\u2032 )).\n\n(2.12)\n\nIf we denote the separation between the two pancakes by R one can show that for R \u226a\n\nR\u2032 \u226a rg the solution of Eq. (2.11) is given simply by\n\n\u03a6(R\u2032 ) = R sin(\u03b8\u2032 )/R\u2032 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nsince the right-hand-side can be neglected in this region. Here \u03b8\u2032 is the azimuthal angle\nin the plane. For R\u2032 \u226b rg the sin(\u03a6) can be replaced by \u03a6 and we see that the solution\ndecays exponentially with a screening length rg . Thus substituting Eq. (2.13) into Eq. (2.12),\nexpanding the cosine to quadratic order and cutting off the integration at a large distance\nR\u2032 = rg and small distance R\u2032 = R the interaction energy becomes\n\u0012 \u00132\nd\u03b50 \u0010 rg \u0011 R\nGJ (R) =\n,\nln\n2\nR\nrg\n\n(2.14)\n\nso we see that it is approximately proportional to R2 . On the other hand when the separation\n\nbetween the centers of the two pancakes becomes larger than rg then a Josephson string is\nformed between the m'th and the m + 1'th planes in a direction parallel to the planes. The\nenergy of the Josephson string is proportional to its length which is equal to R, the pancakes'\n8\n\n\fseparation. The calculation of this energy is rather involved and discussed by Clem, Coffey\nand Hao16 . The final result is\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u03bb\nR\nGJ (R) = d\u03b50 1.12 + ln\n.\nd\nrg\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe question now arises how to match these two interaction potentials valid for R \u226a rg and\nR \u226b rg , one behaving quadratically in R and one linearly in R. One such extrapolation\nwas given by Ryu, Doniach, Deutscher and Kapitulnik (RDDK)17, who achieved a matching\n\nby keeping the coefficient of the linear term in R as given in Eq. (2.15) in both regions,\nchoosing the matching point to be at R = 2rg , and subtracting a constant so that the\ntwo expressions would vanish at the matching point. Keeping the same constant in both\nexpressions assures that the first derivative is continuous at the matching point. RDDK\nalso replaced the constant 1.12 by 1. There are ways to improve the extrapolation42 but\nthey do not change significantly the results of the simulations performed using the RDDK\nformula. Unfortunately there was a mistake by a factor of \u03c0/2 in the RDDK formula\nthat we corrected below that has the effect of renormalizing the anisotropy parameter by\np\nabout \u03c0/2 \u2248 1.25 since the major contribution to the simulations come from the region\n\nR < 2rg . To summarize, the London free-energy for inter-layer (IL) Josephson coupling is\n\ngiven approximately by:\nd\u03c60 2\nIIL (Ri,m , Ri,m+1) =\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bb2\n\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013 \u0014\n\u0015\n(|Ri,m \u2212 Ri,m+1 |)2\n\u03bb\n1 + ln\n\u22121 ,\nd\n4rg 2\n\n(2.16)\n\nfor |Ri,m \u2212 Ri,m+1 | < 2rg , and\nd\u03c60 2\nIIL (Ri,m , Ri,m+1) =\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bb2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013 \u0014\n\u0015\n|Ri,m \u2212 Ri,m+1 |\n\u03bb\n1 + ln\n\u22122 ,\nd\nrg\n\n(2.17)\n\nfor |Ri,m \u2212 Ri,m+1 | > 2rg . Here the position of a pancake is specified in terms of cylindrical\ncoordinates. Thus the position of the i'th pancake in the m'th plane is given by (Ri,m , md),\nwhere Ri,m is a two dimensional vector in the ab plane. The index i labels the FL that the\npancake is a part of. We have considered only pancakes belonging to the same FL. This is\nbecause for large separations by definition the Josephson string is formed among pancakes\nbelonging to the same FL. We do check for the energy of all nearest neighboring pairs when\ndeciding how to connect pancakes and we allow the process of flux \"cutting\" and switching.\nIn the case that pancakes belonging to different FL's approach each other to a distance\nmuch smaller than rg , than there will be an interaction of the form of Eq. (2.14), however\n9\n\n\fthis occurrence is rather rare for magnetic fields of the strength considered here and hence\nneglected by RDDK and also in this work.\nWhen using Eqs.(2.16) and (2.17) it is necessary to specify the temperature dependence\nof \u03bb. Different choices for this dependence are found in the literature. In this work we used\nthe same choice as in Refs.2,17,34 , motivated by Ginzburg-Landau (GL):\n\u03bb2 (0)\n= 1 \u2212 T /Tc .\n\u03bb2 (T )\n\n(2.18)\n\nSome authors18,37 use a dependence of the form\n\u03bb2 (0)\n= 1 \u2212 (T /Tc )2 .\n2\n\u03bb (T )\n\n(2.19)\n\nRecent experiments35 show that the temperature dependence of the london penetration\ndepth is not universal and depend on the amount of doping and the sample history. In Fig.\n(1) we show the temperature dependence of the three samples investigated in Ref.[35]. Also\nshown on the figure is the two fluid dependence1 \u03bb2 (0)/\u03bb2 (T ) = 1 \u2212 (T /Tc )4 which normaly\napplies in the opposite limit of very small GL ratio \u03ba = \u03bb(0)/\u03be(0), unlike high-Tc materials.\nDisplayed also is the weak coupling, clean limit BCS curve. Both curves are lying above the\nexperimental data. We added to the original figure the two behaviors given in Eqs. (2.18)\nand (2.19) to show that the experimental data actually falls between theses two curves,\nso they give reasonable lower and upper bounds to the experimental results. In the result\nsection we discuss how this choice of temperature dependence affects the comparison of the\nsimulation results with experiments.\n\nB.\n\nElectromagnetic Coupling\n\nThis coupling can be obtained from the Lawrence-Doniach model discussed at the beginning of this section by putting \u03b3 = \u221e, which eliminates the Josephson coupling altogether.\n\nExtensive calculations can be found in the literature2,3,12 . For the in-plane interaction between two pancakes one finds,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\u0012\nC\nd\nd\nln\n+ E1 ,\nU(Rij , 0) = 2d\u03b50\n1\u2212\n2\u03bb\nRij 2\u03bb\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere Rij = |Ri,m \u2212 Rj,m| is the radial distance in cylindrical coordinates and \"m\" denotes\nthe index of the plane.\n10\n\n\f1\n\nFIG. 1: Temperature dependence of the normalized penetration depth for 3 experimental samples\nas given in Ref. 35. For comparison the two-fluid and BCS result for clean superconductors in the\nweak coupling limit are shown. We also added the linear and quadratic behavior as given in Eqs.\n(2.18) and (2.19) in the text, represented by dashed and dot-dashed lines respectively.\n\nThe interaction between two pancakes situated at different planes (Ri,m , md) and\n(Rj,n , nd) is given by,\nd2 \u03b50\nU(Rij , z) = \u2212\n\u03bb\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC\nexp(\u2212|z|/\u03bb) ln\n\u2212 E2 ,\nRij\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere Rij = |Ri,m \u2212 Rj,n |, and z = (m \u2212 n)d.\nIn the above equations we defined\nE1 =\nE2 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nRij\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c1 exp(\u2212\u03c1/\u03bb)/\u03c1,\n\n(2.22)\n\np\nd\u03c1 exp(\u2212 z 2 + \u03c12 /\u03bb)/\u03c1,\n\n(2.23)\n\nRij\n\nC is a constant of the order of the system's size that cancels out upon taking energy differences.\n\nIII.\n\nNOTES ON THE SIMULATIONS\n\nWe work with M rhombically shaped cells stacked on top of each other in z direction.\nAll of these cells have periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions. Each one of\n11\n\n\fthese rhombic units cells also repeats itself every M th plane due to the periodic boundary\ncondition in z direction as well. Thus we have periodic boundary conditions in all directions.\nThere are a total of N pancakes in each of the M cells. We work with two system sizes\nto safeguard against any possibile finite size effects. While working with N = 36 we chose\nM = 25 in most cases, except for B = 100 G and \u03b3 \u2264 150, where the number of planes was\nincreased from 25 to 36. For low fields and anisotropies the entanglement length along the c\naxis becomes large, and hence in order to observe a sharp transition a larger system size in\nthe z-direction is needed. Similarly, for 64 pancakes in each plane, we usually work with a\ntotal of 20, 25 or 36 planes depending on the values of parameter B and \u03b3. In all the cases\nconsidered in this paper we always had a total of at least 900 beads (N = 36, M = 25) and\na maximum of 2304 beads (N = 64, M = 36). A FL consists of one pancake from each and\nevery plane. Pancakes belonging to a given FL were tracked with pointers and linked lists31 .\nPancakes were moved by either Metropolis algorithm31 or its advance form, multilevel\nMonte Carlo (MMC)32 . Which method to employ in a particular case usually depends upon\nthe anisotropy and the magnetic field, as described below.\nFor most anisotropies and magnetic fields, the MMC technique was used. In MMC we\nupdate several pancakes spread over many planes at once. Thus for the lower anisotropies\n\u03b3 = 125 and 150, and B = 100 G, a total of 15 to 20 beads spread over 5 planes were used\nto update the system. For other anisotropies and fields (\u03b3 \u2265 250 and B \u2264 900 G) it suffices\nto use just 3 planes in the MMC technique.\nFor different parameter ranges, one needs to use different methods of updating the FL's.\nFor example, one can not use MMC method for \u03b3 = \u221e since there is no natural choice to\ngenerate paths sampled with a free Gaussian distribution. Even at higher values of \u03b3, such\nas 500, the MMC method using 5 planes would be slow and inefficient. Thus for \u03b3 \u2265 375\nand B \u2265 300, we move only one pancake at a time using the Metropolis algorithm. Flux\ncutting was implemented by using a different kind of move to allow for the large wiggling\nof the FL's (and thus to avoid bias towards straighter FL configurations). In this move\nthe two ends of neighboring lines were switched by considering only the relevant Josephson\ninteractions without attempting to displace any of the pancakes involved.\nJust like the case with high anisotropies discussed above, in the MMC implementation\nalso we allowed for large wiggling of FL's along the z-direction by introducing the process of\nflux cutting. Starting from a few neighboring lines, we cut chunks of FL's spreading over a\n12\n\n\fnumber of planes. New paths between the starting and ending positions of the FL's thus cut\nwere made using a random walk through the space of permutations13 and the subsequent\nuse of the bisection method32 .\nOf course there are ranges of parameters where more than one method of update can be\nemployed (e.g. Metropolis method, MMC with 3 planes or MMC with 5 planes.). In these\ncases of overlap, relevant methods were found to lead to the same result, as they should.\nFurther details on the simulation technique are supplied in Ref. 25.\nThe logarithmic part of the in-plane and out of plane electromagnetic interaction (see\nEqs. (2.20) and (2.21)) was handled by analytically summing over the interaction as shown\nin the Appendix B. The integrals E1 and E2 were evaluated numerically taking into account\nthe periodic boundary conditions in all directions. This is accomplished by considering\nimages of pancakes in all directions.\nIn the simulations as T is raised it is B that is kept fixed, not H, as done in experiments.\nThis causes the phase transition to be less sharp, especially at low fields (where the phase\nboundary is flatter), as is evident from Fig. 2. The figure shows both the H \u2212 T and B \u2212 T\nphase diagrams schematically. In the B \u2212 T phase diagram there is a region where both\nthe vortex-solid and vortex-liquid phases coexist. The paths corresponding to increasing\ntemperature at constant B (MC) and constant H (experiment) are shown.\nThe broadening of the phase transition can be avoided by using 'isobaric\" Monte Carlo\nsimulations13 , but this was not done in the present work.\nWe measured the following physical quantities. For details the reader is referred to our\nearlier work25 .\n\nA.\n\nEnergy\n\nAn expression for energy can be obtained from\nE = kT 2\n\n\u2202\nln(\u039e(\u039b, \u03b2, N)).\n\u2202T\n\n(3.1)\n\nDue to the internal temperature dependence of \u03bb on T , one gets a very complicated expression for energy (not written down here). However, a simplified expression for energy can\nbe obtained under the assumption that a0 < \u03bb, since in this case it is justified to ignore\nthe internal temperature dependence of \u03bb on T while taking derivatives with respect to the\n13\n\n\fVL\n\nVL\n\nH\n\nexp\n\nB\nexp\nMC\n\nVS\n\nMC\n\nVS\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nT\n\nT\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic phase diagram showing the vortex-solid (VS) and votex-liquid (VL) phases in\nthe H \u2212 T and B \u2212 T planes. The path the system traces as the temperature is raised at fixed B\n(MC) or fixed H (exp) are indicated\n\ntemperature13 . The energy expression obtained for the case when a0 < \u03bb is given in Ref.\n25. This expression, however, was seen to work well even for the cases where a0 \u223c \u03bb and\nthe difference between the simplified and the exact energy calculations was found to be\ninsignificant for all cases except for very low values of B such as 40 \u2212 80 G (we used these\nvalues for only \u03b3 = \u221e). We have used the simplified expression for the energy in all cases. It\nwould not affect the melting transition in anyway. The only change will be that the energies\nobtained will be off by a few percents for the case when the magnetic field is very small.\n\nB.\n\nTranslational structure factor\n\nThe translational structure factor S(Q1 ) is defined as,\n+\n*\nX\n1\nS(Q1 ) =\ne(iQ1 .(Ri,m \u2212Rj,m )) ,\nMN ij,m\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere h...i stands for the MC average, and Q1 stands for a reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the first Bragg peak and is given by\nQ1 =\n\n2\u03c0\n(e1 \u2212 e2 cos \u03b8),\na0 sin2 \u03b8\n14\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, a0 is the nearest neighbor distance and e1,2 are the unit vectors along the\nhexagonal unit cell such that\ne1 * e2 = cos \u03b8.\nC.\n\n(3.4)\n\nLine entanglement\n\nAs we allow permutations of FL's, we can define a number Ne /N as that fraction of\nthe total number of FL's which belong to loops that are bigger than the size of a \"simple\"\nloop. A simple loop is defined as a set of M beads connected end to end, M being the total\nnumber of planes. Loops of size 2M, 3M... start proliferating at and above the transition\ntemperature and in the corresponding 2D boson system this proliferation is related to the\nonset of the superfluidity.\nSome of the other important parameters were taken as follows: \u03bb0 = 1700 \u00c5, d = 15 \u00c5\nand Tc = 90 K.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nJosephson and electromagnetic coupling\n\nIn this section we discuss the results when Josephson as well as electromagnetic couplings\nare included in the expression for the free-energy functional. Three different quantities, the\ntranslational structure factor at the first Bragg peak S(Q1 ), the energy E and the line\nentanglement Ne /N were monitored. Simulations were done for four different anisotropy\nparameters \u03b3 = 125, 250, 375 and 500. In addition we carried out simulations for two different\ntemperature dependence of the penetration depth. The results for the first temperature\ndependence of \u03bb, namely \u03bb2 (0)/\u03bb2(T ) = 1 \u2212 T /Tc , are shown in Figs. (3)-(6). The results\n\nfor the second dependence of \u03bb, i.e. \u03bb2 (0)/\u03bb2(T ) = 1 \u2212 (T /Tc )2 will be discussed later, in\n\nthe context of the phase diagram.\nTo check against possible finite size effects we worked with two different system sizes,\nnamely 36 and 64 FL's, as discussed in the previous section.

The location of the FOT is inferred from a sharp decay in S(Q1 ) and a sharp\nrise in the line entanglement and a discontinuous jump in energy E. Except for the case\nwith \u03b3 = 125 and B = 100 G, the transition is sharp and can be easily located. In all the\ncases, we see a discontinuous jump in E. The size of the jump can be determined in the\nfollowing way. Take two sets of points on E vs. Tr = T /(1 \u2212 T /Tc ) graph, one in the vortex\nsolid phase and the other in the vortex liquid phase. This can be done by using S(Q1 ) or\nNe /N vs. Tr graphs.

The two lines are extended up to the transition temperature and\nthe jump in E is read off.\nIt is clear from the E vs. Tr graphs that for a given anisotropy one gets lower jumps in\nE at higher magnetic fields. This effect is more pronounced for higher anisotropies.\n\nB.\n\nOnly electromagnetic coupling\n\nMany simulation studies completely neglect the Josephson coupling26,38 and work only\nwith the electromagnetic coupling. In this section we discuss the results obtained with\nneglecting the Josephson interaction (\u03b3 = \u221e). The results are shown in Fig. 7. The\nresults can be compared with a recent simulation study of the same system using substrate\nmodel37,38 . The phase boundary obtained by Dodgson et al. falls almost on top of the phase\nboundary obtained in this paper. Another important feature of this study is the increasing\nenergy jumps toward lower magnetic fields as well as almost diminishing jumps in E toward\nvery high magnetic fields (B > 900 G). The entropy jump calculated using the formula\n\u2206s = \u2206E/T shows an increasing trend towards higher temperature (not shown here) again\nin agreement with the references cited above.\n18\n\n\f0.8\n(a)\n\n0.7\n\nE (102 k K)\n\nS(Q1)/N\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120\nT/(1-T/Tc) (K)\n\n140\n\n160\n\n(b)\n\n20\n\n0.9\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120\nT/(1-T/Tc) (K)\n\n140\n\n160\n\n2.2\n(c)\n\n0.8\n\n(d)\n\n2\n\n0.7\n\n1.8\n\n0.6\n\n1.6\n\nE (102 k K)\n\nS(Q1)/N\n\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.4\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n80\nT/(1-T/Tc) (K)\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n80\nT/(1-T/Tc) (K)\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFIG. 7: \u03b3 = \u221e (no Josephson coupling).

(d) Energy for the same fields as in (c).\n\nAlso, for the very high magnetic fields, the transition takes place at T2D = 16 K, independent of the magnetic field. This result is in agreement with many theoretical studies2,18 . In\nthis regime of fields each set of pancakes in a plane melts irrespective of the other planes and\nshows a characteristic 2D melting transition at T2D \u2248 16 \u2212 19 K. This kind of 2D melting\nis expected at high fields as the in-plane pancakes get closer to each other and hence the\nin-plane interaction keeps getting stronger compared to out of plane interaction and the\ndifferent layers start to melt independent of each other26 .\nComparing results with the previous section, it is clear that the Josephson interaction,\npresent at finite anisotropy, has the effect of reducing the energy jumps compared to the\ncase when only the electromagnetic coupling is included.\n\n19\n\n\fC.\n\nPhase diagram\n\nBased on the results from the previous two sections, we obtain a phase diagram for\nBSCCO which is shown in Fig. 8. The diagram shows the melting curves for various\nanisotropies, including the case when there is no Josephson coupling. On the same diagram we also show two experimental lines, one for the melting transition7,39 and the other\nfor the irreversibility line40 . The experimental irreversibility line falls very close to the simulated \u03b3 = 250 phase boundary. The actual experimental melting curve does not seem to fall\non any of the melting lines obtained from the simulations. The experimental melting line\nbends downward toward lower temperatures and this feature could not be seen here. This\nmay the result of point defects present even in pristine samples, an effect reported in recent\nsimulations22,23 .\nIn Fig. 9 we show the phase diagram obtained by assuming a different dependence of \u03bb\np\non temperature, namely \u03bb(T ) = \u03bb(0)/ 1 \u2212 T 2 /Tc2 . For this choice the irreversibility line\n\nfalls somewhat below the \u03b3 = 500 simulated phase boundary, leading to an estimate of\n\u03b3 \u2248 450. As discussed above the temperature dependence should be somewhere in between\nthese dependences so an estimate of \u03b3 = 300 \u2212 400 for the experimental sample is probably\nreasonable.\nWe have found that the data for the phase boundaries can be collapsed on a single curve\nfor the case of finite anisotropy even when using different temperature dependences of \u03bb.\nWhen we plot the variable B\u03b3 2 at the melting transition versus the variable kT /(\u03b50 (T )d) all 8\ncurves fall on top of each other. Koshelev21 argues that when Josephson coupling dominates\nover electromagnetic coupling the phase boudary is determined by a single dimensionless\nfunction of the dimensionless parameters kT /\u03b50 d where \u03b50 (T ) = \u03c620 /(4\u03c0\u03bb(T ))2 and rg2 /a20 \u221d\nB\u03b3 2 . In Fig.(10 we plot ln(B\u03b3 2 ) versus ln(kT /(\u03b50 d)) and the data collapses to a straight\nline with slope (\u22122). This suggests that the transition is given by a single relation\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b3d\nkT\n= \u039bc\n\u039b\u2261 \u221a\na0\n2\u03b50 d\n\n(4.1)\n\nas is known to be the case for YBCO13 . From a simple cage model (see e.g. Ref. 36)\nit follows that the \u039bc = c2L , where cL is the Lindemann coefficient. This means that the\ntransition occurs when the mean square devaiation of the FL from a straight line exceeds\ncL a0 , where a0 is the lattice constant. Since we find that \u039bc \u2248 0.1, it appears that cL \u2248 0.3\n20\n\n\f1000\n\n800\n\nB (G)\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nT (K)\n\np\nFIG. 8: Phase diagram obtained by using \u03bb(T ) = \u03bb(0)/ 1 \u2212 T /Tc : Melting transitions for various\n\nanisotropies \u03b3 = 125 (filled triangles), \u03b3 = 250 (open circles), 375 (filled circles), 500 (open\ntriangles), \u221e (filled squares) and experimental(inverted triangles and diamonds) are shown.\n\n(It was estimated to be 0.25 for YBCO13 ). Notice that actually the expression for \u039b should\n\u221a\nbe kT /(a0 2\u03b5l \u03b50 ) and we have used \u03b5l = \u03b50 /\u03b3 2 . Had we included the factor ln(\u03bb/d) in\n\u221a\n\u03b5l we would have obtained \u039bc = 0.1/ 5 \u2248 0.045 and cL \u2248 0.2. Thus cL turns out to be\ncomparable to that found for YBCO. This phase diagram shows the importance of keeping\nthe Josephson coupling. Even if the anisotropy parameter is as large as \u03b3 = 500, it is still\nnot appropriate to neglect the Josephson coupling entirely.\nFor \u03b3 = \u221e there is another scaling which collapses the data37,38 for the two kinds of\ntemperature dependence we considered, namely plotting B/B\u03bb at the melting transition vs.\nkT /(\u03b50 d), where B\u03bb = \u03c60 /\u03bb2 (T ). This is an approximate scaling of the electromagnetic\ninteraction valid when the dependence on the small parameter d/\u03bb can be neglected. In\nFig. (11) we show the collapsed data for two different temperature dependences and also\ncompare with the result of Dodgson et al37,38 .\n\n21\n\n\f1000\n\n800\n\nB (G)\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n10\n\nFIG. 9:\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\nT (K)\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\np\nPhase diagram obtained by using \u03bb(T ) = \u03bb(0)/ 1 \u2212 T 2 /Tc2 : Melting transitions for\n\nvarious anisotropies \u03b3 = 125 (filled triangles), \u03b3 = 250 (hollow circles), 375 (filled circles), 500\n\n(hollow triangles), \u221e (filled squares) and experimental melting transition (inverted triangles) and\nthe experimental irreversiblity line (diamonds) are shown.\nD.\n\nComparison: local and nonlocal interactions\n\nIt is easy to show that the expression for the interaction of a single pancake with an infinite\nset of pancakes stacked on top of each other reduces to the modified Bessel function of second\nkind K0 (R/\u03bb) where R is the distance of the pancake from the stack of the pancakes (see\nAppendix A). At lower temperatures, magnetic field and anisotropy, the FL's are straight so\nit has been considered a good approximation to replace the nonlocal interaction between the\npancakes with a local one of type mentioned above. For example we have used this model\nin a recent simulation25 . In this section we compare the results obtained by replacing the\nnonlocal electromagnetic interaction with a local interaction of the K0 type. The results are\nshown in Fig. 12, assuming the temperature dependence \u03bb2 (0)/\u03bb2(T ) = 1 \u2212 t. In Fig. 12(a)\nwe show the phase lines for \u03b3 = 125 and 250. The phase lines for \u03b3 = 125 from the two\nmodels fall almost on top of each other. Even for \u03b3 = 250 the deviation is still small. This is\nreasonable, as one expects that the FL deviates less from a straight line configuration when\n22\n\n\f21\n\n20\n\nln(B (G) \u03b32)\n\n19\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n-4\n\n-3.5\n\n-3\n\n-2.5\n-2\nln(kT/(\u03b50 d))\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nFIG. 10: Data for finite anisotropies \u03b3 = 125 ( triangles),250 (circles),375 (squares) and 500\n(inverted triangles) from Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 collapse onto a single curve.

Some spread in the data is attributed to the fact that this scaling is not valid at\nhigh values of anisotropies where Josephson coupling becomes comparable to the electromagnetic\ncoupling.\n\n\u03b3 is small. In Fig. 12(b-d) we compare the results obtained here with a previous paper25\nfor \u03b3 = 125 and B = 125 G. There is a small shift in transition temperature of about 3 K.\nIt is clear that if one shifts the S(Q1 ) line obtained with K0 (R/\u03bb) interaction by around 3\nK to the right, then the two curves will fall almost on top of each other.\nFig. 12(b) compares the energy jumps for the same two case as in Fig. 12(b). Except\nfor slight shift in the transition temperature, the jumps in energy are identical. Fig. 12(c)\nshows the line entanglement and as expected we again see a slight shift in the position where\nline entanglement takes place, consistent with Fig. 12(b) and 12(c).\nThis justifies our claim that for the smaller anisotropies (\u03b3 \u2248 125) it is a good approximation to replace the non local electromagnetic interaction with a local one of the type\nK0 (R/\u03bb).\n\n23\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\nB/B\u03bb\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nkT/(\u03b50 d)\n\nFIG. 11: Data for \u03b3 = \u221e from Fig. 8 (triangles) and Fig. 9 (squares) collapse onto a single curve.\nAlso shown is the melting line obtained by Dodgson et al.37 (circles).\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we introduced a model which incorporates the electromagnetic interaction\nand Josephson interaction among pancake vortices in the highly anisotropic BSCCO in\na more systematic way than previously done. Instead of approximating the effect of the\nelectromagnetic interaction by an in-plane repulsive interaction between pancakes that is\ngiven by a Bessel function of the second kind we treat this interaction exactly and in addition\nwe include the Josephson coupling. Treating the electromagnetic interaction as an effective\nBessel function interaction is valid only if FL's do not deviate too much from straight lines.\nThese distortions can be quite large close to the melting transition when the flux cutting\nmechanism starts to proliferate. Thus in the present model interaction among pancakes is\ntaken in a more realistic manner. There are still some approximations involved in this model\nbut we believe that the result are more acurate than previousely obtained.\nThe phase boundaries for various anisotropies were obtained. It was shown that for finite\nanisotropy, when Josephson coupling plays a role, it tends to smoothen out energy jumps\ncompared to the case when only the electromagnetic coupling is kept.

(b) S(Q1 ) vs. temperature for \u03b3 = 150. this paper(solid squares), Ref.\n25(open circles) (c) and (d) show E and Ne /N with the same symbols and \u03b3 value as in part (b)\n\ntend to increase with increasing anisotropy. They are also found to decrease with increasing\nmagnetic field along the phase boundary. The phase diagram clearly shows a shift in the\ntransition temperature as a function of the anisotropy.\nFor finite anisotropy up to a value of 500 we showed that the data can be collapsed to\na straight line in the ln-ln plot of B\u03b3 2 versus kT /\u03b50 d meaning that the transition occurs\nwhen a single variable combination of temperature, magnetic field and anisotropy becomes\ncritical. From here we could deduce the value of the Lindemann parameter to be about 0.3.\nFor infinite anisotropy we obtained scaling when plotting B\u03bb2 /\u03c60 vs. kT /\u03b50 d.\nWhile keeping just the electromagnetic coupling we observe a typical 2D melting behavior towards high magnetic fields where the transition temperature T2D \u223c 16 K becomes\nindependent of the magnetic field. Our results for \u03b3 = \u221e were compared with a recent\n\nsimulation study using the substrate model37,38 . The agreement between the two results is\nexcellent.\n\n25\n\n\fFinally we have compared the two cases where the electromagnetic interaction is treated\napproximately (Ref. 25) and exactly (this paper) for a value of \u03b3 = 125. It is shown that in\nthis case transition temperatures are very close and keeping just the in-plane interaction in\nthe form of a modified Bessel function of the second kind is a good approximation, justifying\nthe claim that we have made in a previous paper25 . In that paper our main goal was to\nextract the effect of columnar pins on the melting transition. For larger anisotropies the\ndeviations of the two treatments become more pronounced.\nComparing with experimental results the simulations seem to agree better with the position of the so-called irreversibility line than with the position of the true melting line. This\nmay be due to the effect of point defects in the experimental samples. Even pristine sample\ncontains point defects that tend to shift the phase boundary towards lower temperatures\nand flatten it out somewhat at the low temperature side. Point defects can also have an\neffect on the energy and entropy jumps across the phase boundary. If one would like to\nextract the value of the anisotropy of the experimental sample from the coparison with the\npresent simulations, we would estimate it to be in the 250-450 range.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE), Grant No. DE-FG0298ER45686.

The solution of the\nabove equation was derived in the appendix of Ref.25.
