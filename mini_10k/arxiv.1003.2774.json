A long-standing problem is how to make sense of this\nsince there is no underlying theory stating when one or the other of these laws is\nto be used. Instead it is left to a judgment whereby state reduction is associated\nwith the fuzzy concept of measurement.\nBased on the premise that quantum state reduction should be taken seriously as a genuine physical process, collapse models [1, 2] are an attempt to\nresolve this situation by suggesting a composite dynamics incorporating state\nreduction events or collapses and unitary state evolution (for general reviews\nsee [3, 4]). The idea is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation should be viewed as an\napproximation to this more general dynamics valid when collapse effects are\nnegligible. Conversely, collapse effects should be seen to dominate in situations\nwhere state reduction is an appropriate description.\n\u2217 Blackett\n\u2020 email:\n\nLaboratory, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, UK.\nd.bedingham@imperial.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\fThe most familiar model of this type is that of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (GRW) [1] describing a system of nonrelativistic quantum particles. The\nessential idea of GRW is that the state of each particle, as a matter of physical\nlaw, occasionally (but very infrequently) undergoes a random collapse to a state\nlocalized in position space. From this law of collapses it follows that quantum\nwavelike behavior becomes increasingly unstable for systems of increasing size\n[1]. Collapse models thus offer a mathematical framework capable of unifying\nquantum and classical domains.\nThe nonrelativistic Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model [2]\nis an improvement on GRW since it preserves the symmetries of systems of\nidentical particles. The formulation of CSL, in terms of a stochastic differential\nequation, invites a straightforward generalization to relativistic quantum field\ntheory (QFT), but it is well known that this results in physically unacceptable\ndivergent behavior [5, 6]. Here we shall address the question of how these\ninfinities can be avoided.\nThe source of divergences, as with other infinite behavior in QFT, can be\ntraced to point interactions between quantum field operators in the dynamical\nequations for the state vector. However, in the case of relativistic collapse models, attempts to renormalize with the inclusion of subtractive counter terms fail.\nThis way of viewing the problem of infinities suggests that a solution could be to\nsmear out the point interactions. The same idea was considered by Nicrosini and\nRimini [7] although their implementation requires the unsatisfactory inclusion\nof a locally preferred frame. In this article we propose the use of a novel relativistic field responsible for mediating the collapse process which enables us to\nfulfill the aim of smearing the interactions whilst preserving Lorentz covariance\nand frame independence. This forms the basis of a relativistic collapse mechanism which naturally resembles CSL, describing state reductions in a smeared\nnumber density eigenbasis.\nThe structure of the article is as follows. We begin the presentation of our\nmodel in section 2 by stating the properties of the mediating field (which we\nsubsequently refer to as the pointer field). In section 3 we define the dynamical\nequations of motion following the outline for relativistic collapse models given\nby Pearle [5]. We discuss the local properties of the model in section 4 and the\nform of the smeared interactions in section 5.\nIn section 6 we describe the collapse process in detail for an idealized example. We estimate a collapse timescale and demonstrate that the dynamics\nreproduce the Born rule. In section 7 we show that the model does not exhibit\nphysically unacceptable divergent behavior by considering how the energy of\nthe system is influenced by the equations of motion. We end with a numerical\ndemonstration of the collapse process and a short discussion.\n\n2\n\nPointer field\n\nConsider a field in which a quantized degree of freedom is associated to each\npoint in spacetime. This is to be contrasted with a standard quantum field whose\n\n2\n\n\fmodes describe the field configuration on a time slice or spacelike hypersurface.\nWe define creation and annihilation operators a(x) and a\u2020 (x) with commutation\nrelations\n[a(x), a\u2020 (x0 )] = \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 x0 )\n\n;\n\n[a(x), a(x0 )] = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nand specify a normalized ground state with the property that a(x)|0i = 0.\nFirst excited states are given by\nZ\n|hi = d\u03c9x h(x)a\u2020 (x)|0i,\n(2)\nwhere d\u03c9x denotes the integration measure over spacetime volume and h is some\ncomplex L2 -function on spacetime. Higher exited states can be constructed by\nrepeated application of the creation operator in this way and we define our\nstate space to accommodate addition of states (enabling field superpositions).\nTo ensure that the field transforms appropriately when specified in different\ncoordinate frames we supply it with the transformation property\n\u22121\nU\u039b,b a(x)U\u039b,b\n= a(\u039bx + b),\n\n(3)\n\nfor a Lorentz coordinate transformation \u039b, spacetime translation b, and unitary\nrepresentation of the Poincar\u00e9 group U .\nWe refer to this general construction as the pointer field since its role in our\nmodel is to make a record of the state of a conventional quantum field with\nwhich it interacts. An equivalent construction used for a different purpose can\nbe found in references [8, 9]. The pointer field's degrees of freedom describe a\nfield configuration over the whole of spacetime.\nThe number density operator is given by n(x) = a\u2020 (x)a(x). We use this to\nconstruct new operators which are smeared over spacetime\nZ\nN (x) = d\u03c9y f (x, y)n(y).\n(4)\nHere f (x, y) is some invariant function on spacetime which is only nonzero for\ny in the past cone of x (see figure 1). Similarly we define\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nA(x) = d\u03c9y g(x, y) a(y) + a\u2020 (y)\n(5)\nwhere g(x, y) is some invariant function which is only nonzero for y in the\nfuture cone of x (figure 1). Proposals for the functions f and g will be specified\nin section 5. Note that\n[N (x), N (x0 )] = 0\n\n\u2200 x, x0 .\n\n(6)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c9y f (x, y)g(x0 , y) a\u2020 (y) \u2212 a(y) ,\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\n[A(x), A(x0 )] = 0\n\nHowever,\n0\n\n[N (x), A(x )] =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\fg(x,y)\nz\n\n\u03c3\n\nx\nf(z,y)\n\nFigure 1: A representation of the domains of functions f and g in spacetime.\nThe points x and z are spacelike separated and \u03c3 denotes a spacelike hypersurface belonging to some spacetime foliation.\n\nwhere the right hand side is only nonzero when x is in the future cone of x0 .\nThis entails that [N (x), A(x0 )] = 0 if x and x0 are spacelike separated.\nWe regard the pointer field as a new and fundamental component of our\nmodel (rather than as some effective construction representing the effects of\nstandard quantum fields).\n\n3\n\nState dynamics\n\nFor a relativistic collapse model we require a covariant description of how the\nstate changes as we advance through spacetime. The dynamics should involve\na classical stochastic input to capture the random character of quantum state\nreduction and we expect our equations to be nonlinear reflecting a feedback\nfrom the state vector to the probability of an outcome.\n\n3.1\n\nTomonaga picture\n\nConsider the orthodox dynamics of a conventional relativistic quantum field.\nIn order to form a covariant description of the evolving state of the field we\nuse the Tomonaga picture: A state |\u03a6(\u03c3)i is assigned to any given spacelike\nhypersurface \u03c3. As we advance the surface \u03c3 to a new surface \u03c3 0 which differs\nfrom \u03c3 only at the point x such that \u03c3 and \u03c3 0 enclose an incremental spacetime\nvolume d\u03c9x , the change of state is given by the Tomonaga equation\ndx |\u03a6(\u03c3)i = \u2212iHint (x)d\u03c9x |\u03a6(\u03c3)i,\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere Hint (x) represents the interaction Hamiltonian. Any interaction terms\nmust be Lorentz scalars to give the equation covariant form and must commute\nat spacelike separation to reflect the fact that there is no temporal ordering of\nspacelike separated points (i.e. no preferred frame). Aharonov and Albert argue\nin reference [10] that, for a covariant description of state collapse, the state\nmust take the form of a functional on the set of spacelike hypersurfaces as in\nthis picture.\nFor our model we consider a state which describes both a quantum field\nand pointer field. Given the commutation relations (6) and (7) and given the\nabove constraints on Hint we may use the Tomonaga picture to describe the\nevolving state where Hint is constructed from terms involving N (x) and A(x)\n(along with quantum field operators). This allows us to describe state evolution\ninvolving interactions between the quantum field and pointer field. We remark\nthat whereas the quantum field state describes the quantum field on some given\nhypersurface, the pointer field state describes the pointer field over the whole\nof spacetime. The pointer field state nevertheless depends on the given hypersurface since this demarcates a boundary of past interactions with the quantum\nfield.\nIn the Tomonaga picture we are required to think of state evolution with\nregards to an ordered sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces. The relationship\nbetween different spacelike hypersurfaces in spacetime can be classified by a\npartial ordering structure. Consider two surfaces \u03c31 and \u03c32 . If no point in \u03c31 is\nto the causal future of any point in \u03c32 then we can say that \u03c31 \u227a \u03c32 . (We will\nalso use the notation \u03c3 \u227a x and x \u227a \u03c3 to denote that the point x is not to the\npast and not to the future of \u03c3 respectively.) The partial order relation \u227a is\nreflexive : \u03c3 \u227a \u03c3,\nantisymmetric : (\u03c31 \u227a \u03c32 ) \u2227 (\u03c32 \u227a \u03c31 ) \u21d2 \u03c31 = \u03c32 ,\ntransitive : \u03c31 \u227a \u03c32 \u227a \u03c33 \u21d2 \u03c31 \u227a \u03c33 .\n\n(9)\n\nA foliation of spacetime is any maximally ordered chain of surfaces. In a model\nwith no preferred frame the foliation should have no physical significance-it\nshould be considered to be analogous to a choice of gauge.\n\n3.2\n\nStochastic processes\n\nIn order to understand the disclosure of stochastic information in the context\nof hypersurfaces advancing through a foliation of spacetime we require an appropriately structured probability space. We specify our probability space by\n(\u03a9, F, Q) along with a filtration {F\u03c3 } of F, defined to be a family of sigmaalgebras F\u03c3 \u2282 F such that\n\u03c31 \u227a \u03c32 \u21d2 F\u03c31 \u2282 F\u03c32 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe partially ordered set structure of the spacelike hypersurfaces is thus induced\non the subset structure of the filtration. The subsets F of \u03a9 belonging to F are\n5\n\n\fthe events of our probability space (e.g. F = {the state assigned to \u03c3 is |0i}).\nWe interpret Q(F ) as the probability that the event F occurs. The construction\nof a filtration on the probability space allows us to formalize the notion that the\nconsequences of the outcome of chance (an element \u03c9 of \u03a9) are not necessarily\nrevealed at once, but rather may emerge sequentially as the system evolves.\nThis is achieved using the concept of conditional expectation with respect to\nF\u03c3 , having the intuitive meaning of conditioning with respect to information\nabout the set of events belonging to F\u03c3 . Stochastic processes in this context\nare random variables indexed by \u03c3.\nWe describe the classical stochastic input of our model in terms of a noise\nfield on spacetime. By comparison with standard Brownian motion we can define\na Brownian motion field in terms of infinitesimal increments dWx specified at\neach spacetime point with properties\nEQ [dWx ] = 0\n\nand\n\ndWx dWx0 = \u03b4x,x0 d\u03c9x ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere EQ [ * ] denotes Q-expectation. We assume that the filtration {F\u03c3 } is\ngenerated by our Brownian motion field such that for any x where \u00ac(\u03c3 \u227a x),\ndWx is F\u03c3 -measurable. We can define a Brownian motion process W\u03c3 such that\nR \u03c30\nW\u03c30 \u2212 W\u03c3 = \u03c3 dWx for any \u03c3 \u227a \u03c3 0 .\n\n3.3\n\nImplicit equation of motion\n\nOther than spacetime, the structure of our model involves three spaces: (i) the\nspace \u03a3 of all possible spacelike hypersurfaces \u03c3 in spacetime; (ii) a probability\nspace (\u03a9, F, Q) in which all dWx are specified; and (iii) a Hilbert space H which\ndescribes the degrees of freedom of our universe (including matter fields, gauge\nfields, and the pointer field). The model describes a joint map from \u03a3 and \u03a9 to\nH\n\u03a6 : {\u03a3, \u03a9} \u2192 H,\n{\u03c3, \u03c9} 7\u2192 |\u03a6(\u03c3, \u03c9)i.\n\n(12)\n\nGiven an initial condition for the state we can define this map in terms of state\nevolution by the stochastic differential equation\n\b\n(13)\ndx |\u03a6(\u03c3)i = \u2212iJ(x)A(x)d\u03c9x \u2212 12 \u03bb2 N 2 (x)d\u03c9x + \u03bbN (x)dWx |\u03a6(\u03c3)i.\nWe also specify a change of probability measure\nEP [ * |F\u03c3 ] =\n\nEQ [ * h\u03a6(\u03c3f )|\u03a6(\u03c3f )i|F\u03c3 ]\n,\nEQ [h\u03a6(\u03c3f )|\u03a6(\u03c3f )i|F\u03c3 ]\n\n(14)\n\nwhich relates the defining probability measure Q, under which all Brownian\nincrements dWx are independent, to the physical probability measure P, under\nwhich stochastic probabilities of evolved states agree with quantum predictions\n(see below). The surface \u03c3f should be entirely to the future of any regions\n6\n\n\fof interest but is otherwise arbitrary owing to the fact that h\u03a6(\u03c3)|\u03a6(\u03c3)i is a\nQ-martingale:\nEQ [h\u03a6(\u03c3 0 )|\u03a6(\u03c3 0 )i|F\u03c3 ] = h\u03a6(\u03c3)|\u03a6(\u03c3)i,\n\n(15)\n\nfor \u03c3 \u227a \u03c3 0 (the tower rule can then be used to show that P-expectations for\ndifferent \u03c3f are equivalent).\nThe stochastic coupling parameter \u03bb is a constant which relates to the rate\nat which the collapse process occurs and the Lorentz invariant operator J(x) is a\nscalar current operator representing the matter density of a quantum field. (For\nexample, we might choose J(x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x) for a Dirac field \u03c8(x).) We will refer\nto J(x) as the matter density operator for the quantum field. We have omitted\nany interactions between different quantum fields in equation (13), however,\nthese can easily be added.\nEquation (13) is a stochastic extension of the Tomonaga formulation of quantum state evolution. By setting \u03bb = 0 we recover the Tomonaga equation in\ndifferential form (8). Provided that J(x) commutes with J(x0 ) for spacelike\nseparated x and x0 then all terms in the evolution equation (13) commute at\nspacelike separation. (This is indeed the case for the example J(x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x)\nwhere {\u03c8(x), \u03c8\u0304(x0 )} = {\u03c8(x), \u03c8(x0 )} = 0 for spacelike separated x and x0 .) This\nfact ensures that the specific foliation used has no physical consequences since\ngiven a fixed initial state and a complete realized set of stochastic information\n{dWx }, for any two foliations which share a common leaf, the assigned state\non that leaf is unique. Equation (14) also shows that the physical probability\ndensity of a given realized set of stochastic information {dWx |\u03c3 \u227a x \u227a \u03c3f }\nconditional on F\u03c3 depends only on the covariantly defined and foliation independent state norm assigned to \u03c3f . This in turn is determined from the state\nat \u03c3 using the same realized stochastic information {dWx |\u03c3 \u227a x \u227a \u03c3f }.\nSince the physical probability of obtaining a given final state depends on\nthe final state itself we refer to this formulation as implicit. Equations (13) and\n(14) completely specify the dynamics of the model in a covariant and frame\nindependent manner.\n\n3.4\n\nCollapse mechanism outline\n\nConsider the pointer field initially in its ground state. As the state evolves\naccording to equation (13), the interaction described by the term J(x)A(x)\nleads to an excitation of the pointer field only in the future cone at x. We\nassume for now that the smearing density g(x, y) is fairly well localized about\nx in some sense. If J(x) is significant at x then the effect can be thought of as\nanalogous to that of a particle passing through a cloud chamber where a record\nof the track is formed and left behind.\nBy contrast, the operator N (x) acts on the pointer field state only in the\npast light cone of the point x, registering the track made by J. The effect\nof the last two terms on the right side of equation (13) can be understood by\n\n7\n\n\fconsidering an incremental stage in the state evolution. We can write\n\b\n(1 + \u2206x )|\u03a6(\u03c3)i \u223c 1 \u2212 12 \u03bb2 N 2 (x)\u2206\u03c9x + \u03bbN (x)\u2206Wx |\u03a6(\u03c3)i\n(\n)\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1 \u2206Wx\n2\n1\n\u223c exp \u2212\u03bb N (x) \u2212\n\u2206\u03c9x + 4 |\u03a6(\u03c3)i.\n2\u03bb \u2206\u03c9x\n\n(16)\n\nHeuristically we see that the state is acted on by a Gaussian positive valued\noperator which is centered about a point determined by the random choice of\n\u2206Wx . This has the effect of diminishing the quantum amplitude of all N (x)eigenstates with respect to this central value. The probability rule (14) is designed to ensure that the location of this projection is more likely where the\nquantum amplitude is greatest and in so doing reproduce the Born rule (we will\nexamine this in detail in section 6). As the state evolves it is impelled by these\nprojections toward an N (x)-eigenstate. Reductions occur to a smeared number\ndensity eigenbasis as with the CSL model. This model can therefore be seen as\na natural relativistic extension of CSL.\nIt is important that the excitations made to the pointer field influence the\nresult of acting with the operator N (x) at x. Equation (7) indicates that this\nis the case provided that the excitation involving A(y) occurs for y in the past\ncone of x.\nSince interactions between the quantum field and the pointer field result in\nentanglement between different quantum matter densities and different pointer\nfield states, the collapse of a superposition of pointer field states will induce\na collapse of quantum field states. We will consider specific examples of this\nprocess in later sections.\n\n3.5\n\nNonlocality\n\nThe probability rule (14) is responsible for nonlocal correlations in this model.\nConsider a state which describes two spacelike separated subsystems of an entangled global system (such as in an EPR-type experiment). Suppose that\neach of these subsystems undergoes a collapse (such as that involved in a spin\nmeasurement). The probability rule ensures not only that the outcomes of the\ncollapse processes for each subsystem occur individually with the correct quantum probabilities but also that the joint probabilities for outcomes in the two\nsubsystems satisfy quantum predictions. In this case we find that the dWx s are\ncorrelated over spacelike separation in the physical probability measure. The\nQ-Brownian motion field behaves as a nonlocal hidden variable in the theory.\nThis is analyzed in detail in reference [11].\n\n3.6\n\nExplicit equation of motion\n\nWe can define a Brownian motion field under the P-measure such that\nEP [dBx ] = 0\n\nand\n\ndBx dBx0 = \u03b4x,x0 d\u03c9x .\n\n8\n\n(17)\n\n\fGiven a specific foliation of spacetime we can relate this to the Q-Brownian\nmotion field by defining\ndBx = dWx \u2212 2\u03bbhN (x)i\u03c3 d\u03c9x ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have used the notation\nh * i\u03c3 =\n\nh\u03a6(\u03c3)| * |\u03a6(\u03c3)i\nh\u03a6(\u03c3)|\u03a6(\u03c3)i\n\n(19)\n\nto denote quantum expectation. It is straightforward to show that this definition\nsatisfies (17). Note that it is the increments dWx which represent the physical\nstochastic information in our model. As stated above, for a given initial state\nand a complete set of realized values {dWx } the final state is uniquely specified\nby equation (13). The construction (18) is just a useful way in which we can\nrepresent the stochastic information but we should be aware that the realized\nvalues dBx are not physical meaningful in the sense that they depend on the\nspecific choice of foliation (via the state defined on surface \u03c3). A different\nfoliation would require a different realized P-Brownian motion field to achieve\nthe same evolved state on a given leaf.\nExpressing equation (13) directly in terms of the P-Brownian motion field\nwe end up with the following nonlinear equation for the normalized state:\nn\n2\ndx |\u03a8(\u03c3)i = \u2212 iJ(x)A(x)d\u03c9x \u2212 21 \u03bb2 [N (x) \u2212 hN (x)i\u03c3 ] d\u03c9x\no\n+ \u03bb [N (x) \u2212 hN (x)i\u03c3 ] dBx |\u03a8(\u03c3)i,\n(20)\n1\n\nwith |\u03a8(\u03c3)i = |\u03a6(\u03c3)ih\u03a6(\u03c3)|\u03a6(\u03c3)i\u2212 2 . This equation enables us to generate\nphysical sample paths for the state in terms of Brownian increments generated\nunder the physical measure for a given spacetime foliation. By construction\nwe know that this equation gives foliation independent results even though the\nnonlinearity obscures this fact.\n\n4\n\nLocal beables\n\nIf the model outlined above is to solve any of the conceptual problems of quantum theory then it must be equipped with a prescription for determining definite\nproperties of the world in bounded regions of spacetime. Bell introduced the\nconcept of local beables to provide such a means of describing a system in classical terms in order to make a clear point of contact with evidence of real world\nphenomena [12].\nIn describing state vector collapse our mathematical framework contains\nonly the state vector and a classical stochastic noise field. We first consider the\nformer. Local properties of the state vector, as described by the action of local\noperators are indefinite for two reasons: (i) the state may not be an eigenstate\nof the operator in question; and (ii) nonlocalities ensure that the action of local\n9\n\n\foperators on the state are affected by distant collapses which may or may not\nhave happened depending on the choice of spacelike hypersurface.\nTo address this Ghirardi [13] has proposed that definite properties of the\ntheory at point x can be defined as the quantum expectations of local operators\nO(x), where the state is assigned to the hypersurface plc(x) forming the past\nlight cone of x (or the spacelike surface which is arbitrarily close to this):\n\u014c(x) = hO(x)iplc(x) .\n\n(21)\n\nAssuming that this past light cone limit is valid, we can define local beables\nin this way which are unambiguous, Lorentz covariant, and frame independent.\nThis does not affect the arbitrary choice of foliation used to describe the state\nevolution-by conditioning on F\u03c3 for any hypersurface \u03c3 passing through the\npoint x, the past light cone state is specified.\nIt should not be necessary to grant beable status to the quantum expectation\nof every local operator in this way. Ghirardi suggests that only the matter\ndensity need be a beable since this is enough to specify the locations of macro\nobjects. In the spirit of relativity we suggest that the beables of the theory\ncould be the stress-energy density of the quantum field\nT\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x) = hT \u03bc\u03bd (x)iplc(x) ,\n\n(22)\n\n(assuming that quantum expectations are finite following renormalization).\nThe other possible choice for the local beable of the theory is the classical\nstochastic noise field. From equation (18) we can associate physical random\nvariables to any finite region of spacetime R as follows:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nWR =\ndWx =\ndBx + 2\u03bb\nd\u03c9x hN (x)i\u03c3 .\n(23)\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nThis is a Lorentz invariant random variable (the explicit \u03c3 dependence is offset\nby the foliation dependence of dBx ). The right side of this equation demonstrates that the physical variable WR is composed of a signal-the quantum\nexpectation\nof the operator N (x) integrated over the region R-and a noise\nR\nBR = R dBx . For regions where the quantum expectation of N (x) is large we\ncan expect a large signal to noise ratio. The random variable WR then gives\na classical image of N (x)-density. This is perhaps the more natural choice for\nthe beables given that the physical noise field is the classical element of the theory. However, note that the essential information in WR is (given in a Lorentz\ninvariant form by) N\u0304 (x). This shows an equivalence between the two proposals.\nIn each case, whether or not these variables are treated as local beables,\nthey are nevertheless well defined Lorentz covariant and frame independent\nlocal properties of the theory.\n\n10\n\n\f5\n\nSmeared operators\n\nOur dynamical equation for the state vector (20) involves two different operators\nacting on the pointer field state:\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nN (x) = d\u03c9y f (x, y)n(y) ; A(x) = d\u03c9y g(x, y) a(y) + a\u2020 (y) .\nEach of these operators potentially describes a nonlocal interaction. The aim\nof this section is to consider some possible forms for the smearing functions f\nand g which satisfy the constraint of Lorentz invariance.\nFirst consider the function g(x, y). In order that the smeared interaction\nsatisfies a reasonable definition of locality we would like for g(x, y) to be appreciable only for points y which are near to x. However, the notion of y being\nnear to x is frame dependent. We therefore propose to use the local properties\nof the theory to determine the form of g(x, y) in a way which takes account of\nthe local energy flow of the field at point x. Specifically we propose a form\n\b\ng(x, y) = C(x) exp \u2212k T\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x)(y\u03bc \u2212 x\u03bc )(y\u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd ) ,\n(24)\nfor y in the future cone of x and g(x, y) = 0 elsewhere. Here k is a positive\nreal constant which controls the rate of decay of g with y and\nR C(x) is a positive real normalization function defined such that g satisfies d\u03c9y g(x, y) = 1.\nNote that the form of g is Lorentz invariant. The exponent is negative definite\nsince for y within the future cone of x we can always choose a frame in which\n(y \u2212 x) defines the time direction and in this frame only the positive definite\nT\u0304 00 component contributes. The stress-energy factor ensures that the function\ndecays more rapidly in those timelike directions in which the magnitude of the\nfield momentum is large (e.g. at the extremes of the light cone). The function g(x, y) thus defines a distribution of points y near to x from the point of\nview of a field rest frame at x. Of course this function could take many other\nforms-this example is intended as an illustration.\nSimilarly for f (x, y) we choose the smeared form\n\b\nf (x, y) = C(x) exp \u2212k T\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x)(x\u03bc \u2212 y\u03bc )(x\u03bd \u2212 y\u03bd ) ,\n(25)\nfor y in the past cone of x and f (x, y) = 0 elsewhere.\nSince T\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x) is involved in the equations of motion of the state then the\nmodel is nonMarkovian: In order to advance the state from some arbitrary\nsurface \u03c3 to another surface \u03c3 0 which differs from \u03c3 only at the point x we must\ndetermine T\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x). Since this depends of the surface plc(x) we require stochastic\ninformation encoded in {dWy } for y to the past of \u03c3 (but outside the past cone\nof x). This makes exact calculations difficult to perform.\n\n6\n\nCollapse process\n\nIn this section we consider a specific example involving an initial superposition of different quantum matter density states. By decomposing into different\n11\n\n\ftime stages where either the field interactions dominate or the collapse process\ndominates we will demonstrate the characteristics of the state dynamics. Let\nus express the initial state (assigned to an initial hypersurface \u03c3i ) as a direct\nproduct of the quantum field state (describing matter) and the pointer state\n|\u03a8(\u03c3i )i = |\u03a8matter i|\u03a8pointer i.\n\n(26)\n\nWe contrive a situation in which the matter field is initially in a superposition\nof idealized J(x)-eigenstates, i.e.\nX\n|\u03a8matter i =\nci |Ji i,\n(27)\ni\n\nwhere |Ji i are normalized and satisfy J(x)|Ji i = Ji (x)|Ji i (Ji (x) is some real\nvalued function of x). The initial condition of the pointer field (prior to interaction) is the ground state. Equation (26) can thus be written\nX\n|\u03a8(\u03c3i )i =\nci |Ji i|0i.\n(28)\ni\n\nA state of this type could, for example, be formed following the interaction\nof some (quantum) measuring device with a quantum particle (prior to any\ninteraction with the pointer field).\nIf we ignore for now the collapse dynamics by setting \u03bb = 0 in equation (20),\nwe have the state evolution equation\ndx |\u03a8(\u03c3)i = \u2212iJ(x)A(x)d\u03c9x |\u03a8(\u03c3)i.\nThis equation has the formal solution\n\u001a Z \u03c3\n\u001b\n|\u03a8(\u03c3)i = exp \u2212i\nd\u03c9x J(x)A(x) |\u03a8(\u03c3i )i,\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n\u03c3i\n\nwhere the terms in the exponent should be time ordered (noting that in general\n[J(x), J(x0 )] 6= 0 for timelike separated x and x0 ). Applying this solution to\nour initial condition (28) we find that after the system has evolved to some\nhypersurface \u03c3int (denoting the end of this pure interaction phase) the state is\ngiven by\nX\n|\u03a8(\u03c3int )i =\nci |Ji i|\u03b1i i,\n(31)\ni\n\nwhere\n\u001aZ\n|\u03b1i i = exp\n\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2020\n\u2217\nd\u03c9y \u03b1i (y, \u03c3int )a (y) \u2212 \u03b1i (y, \u03c3int )a(y) |0i,\n\n(32)\n\nand\nZ\n\n\u03c3int\n\n\u03b1i (y, \u03c3int ) = \u2212i\n\nd\u03c9x Ji (x)g(x, y).\n\u03c3i\n\n12\n\n(33)\n\n\fFrom equation (32) it is straightforward to show that the state |\u03b1i i has the\nproperty\na(z)|\u03b1i i = \u03b1i (z, \u03c3int )|\u03b1i i.\n\n(34)\n\nThe pointer field state is therefore a coherent state. Equation (33) entails that\nthe pointer field is excited in proportion to the matter density and is only excited\nin locations near where the matter density is nonzero (see equation (24)). This\nanalysis shows that a superposition state in the matter field leaves an imprint\non the pointer field. An initial superposition of different J(x)-states results in\nan entangled superposition of a-eigenstates after a short period of interaction.\nNotice that this will lead to a loss of coherence for the matter field state in cases\nwhere the pointer field is significantly excited (the pointer field behaves as an\nenvironment) .\nIf the pointer field is in the state |\u03b1i i, then the quantum expectation value\nof the operator N (x) is\nZ\nh\u03b1i |N (x)|\u03b1i i = d\u03c9y f (x, y)|\u03b1i (y, \u03c3int )|2 ,\n(35)\nand the quantum variance of the operator N (x) is\nZ\nh\u03b1i |N 2 (x)|\u03b1i i \u2212 h\u03b1i |N (x)|\u03b1i i2 = d\u03c9y f 2 (x, y)|\u03b1i (y, \u03c3int )|2 .\n\n(36)\n\nThis means that the size of quantum fluctuations in N (x) behaves approximately\nas the square root of the expected value. Therefore, for sufficiently large values\nof Ji (x) (corresponding to macroscopic matter) we can make the assumption\nthat |\u03b1i i is an approximate N (x)-eigenstate:\nZ\nN (x)|\u03b1i i ' d\u03c9y f (x, y)|\u03b1i (y, \u03c3int )|2 |\u03b1i i.\n(37)\nWe now turn to the collapse dynamics, ignoring the J(x)A(x) interaction\nterm in equation (20):\nn\n2\ndx |\u03a8(\u03c3)i = \u2212 21 \u03bb2 [N (x) \u2212 hN (x)i\u03c3 ] d\u03c9x\no\n+ \u03bb [N (x) \u2212 hN (x)i\u03c3 ] dBx |\u03a8(\u03c3)i.\n(38)\nWe take the state to be of the idealized postinteraction form\nX\n|\u03a8(\u03c3int )i =\nci |Ji i|Ni i,\n\n(39)\n\ni\n\nwhere |Ni i satisfies hNi |Nj i = \u03b4ij and N (x)|Ni i = Ni (x)|Ni i (Ni (x) is a real\nvalued function of x). Denoting the quantum variance of the operator N (x) as\nVar\u03c3 [N (x)] = hN 2 (x)i\u03c3 \u2212 hN (x)i2\u03c3 ,\n13\n\n(40)\n\n\fwe find that for a state of the form (39),\n!2\nVar\u03c3int [N (x)] =\n\nX\n\n|ci |\n\n2\n\nNi2 (x)\n\n\u2212\n\ni\n\nX\n\n2\n\n|ci | Ni (x)\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\ni\n\nThe quantum variance is greater than or equal to zero, and is only equal to\nzero if either (i) |cj | = 1 for some j and ci6=j = 0 for all other is, or (ii) all\nNi (x)s have the same value. We assume that the second situation is not true\neverywhere.\nSimilarly let us define the quantum covariance of N (x) and N (y) by\nCov\u03c3 [N (x), N (y)] = hN (x)N (y)i\u03c3 \u2212 hN (x)i\u03c3 hN (y)i\u03c3 .\n\n(42)\n\nFrom equation (38) we can show that the quantum variance of N (x) satisfies\nthe process\ndy Var\u03c3 [N (x)] = \u22124\u03bb2 Cov2\u03c3 [N (x), N (y)]d\u03c9y\n\u0002\n+2\u03bb hN 2 (x)N (y)i\u03c3 \u2212 hN 2 (x)i\u03c3 hN (y)i\u03c3\n\u0003\n\u22122hN (x)i\u03c3 hN (x)N (y)i\u03c3 + 2hN (x)i2\u03c3 hN (y)i\u03c3 dBy .

In\ngeneral for nonzero covariance of N , equation (44) indicates that the P-expected\nquantum variance will decrease as \u03c3 advances through spacetime. Since the\nP-expectation of quantum variance tends to zero then the realized quantum\nvariance must tend to zero.

Further consider V4 to be the spatial volume of the symmetric difference R1 4R2 (containing points belonging to one but not both of R1 and R2 ).\nUsing equations (45), (42), (40), (37), and (33), and assuming that the smearing scales associated with f (x, y) and g(x, y) are much smaller than the scale\nassociated with V4 , we find \u03c4coll \u223c \u03bb\u22122 V4\u22121 J \u22124 . The rate of reduction depends\non the magnitude of the matter density eigenvalue J and the spatial extent of\nthe region R1 4R2 . This amplification effect ensures that low energy excitations can be essentially unaffected by the collapse mechanism whilst large scale\nsuperpositions (as characterized by J and V4 ) undergo rapid state reduction.\nThe precise rate is controlled by the stochastic coupling parameter.\nSo far we have considered the dynamics of the state vector. In order to\ndescribe the system in definite terms we must consider the dynamics of the\nlocal properties of the theory. In order to estimate the stress-energy density we\nmake the simplifying assumption that in the rest frame of the matter field, only\nthe T 00 component is nonzero. This corresponds to the assumption that the\nmatter behaves as a swarm of noninteracting particles. In this frame we assume\nthat\nT 00 (x)|Ji i = Ei (x)|Ji i,\n\n(50)\n\nwith all other components equal to zero. We further assume Ei (x) and Ji (x)\nare related in that they agree with regards to the approximate distribution of\nmatter. With the state given by equation (31) (with \u03c3int = plc(x)), the stress\nenergy density beable in the matter field rest frame is\nX\nT\u0304 00 (x) =\n|c1 |2 Ei (x).\n(51)\ni\n\nAfter collapse when the state takes the form of equation (49) (with \u03c3coll =\nplc(x)), T\u0304 00 (x) is equal to Ei (x) with probability |ci |2 .\n\n15\n\n\f7\n\nEnergy process\n\nWe have seen in previous sections that the collapse terms in the dynamical\nequation for the state vector involve the operators N (x) and that this results\nin collapse toward an N (x)-eigenstate. If we had chosen, for example, a scalar\nfield operator \u03c6(x) in place of N (x) we would expect collapse toward a \u03c6(x)eigenstate. The problem in this case is that, as the \u03c6(x)-state becomes more\ncertain, the scalar field momentum state becomes more uncertain. The result\nis a divergent increase in the energy density [5, 6].\nHere we demonstrate that the present model does not suffer from this problem. A sensible choice for the energy of the pointer field is given by\nZ\nHpointer = d\u03c9x a\u2020 (x)i\u2202x0 a(x).\n(52)\nThis operator generates time translations in the pointer field annihilation and\ncreation operators:\n[Hpointer , a(x)] = \u2212i\u2202x0 a(x) ; [Hpointer , a\u2020 (x)] = \u2212i\u2202x0 a\u2020 (x).\n\n(53)\n\nFor the operator A(x) we have\nZ\n[Hpointer , A(x)] = \u2212\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c9y g(x, y)i\u2202y0 a(y) + a\u2020 (y) .\n\n(54)\n\nThe pointer field energy does not generate time translations in A(x) unless we\nmake the assumption that \u2202x0 g(x, y) ' \u2212\u2202y0 g(x, y) valid when T\u0304 \u03bc\u03bd (x) is slowly\nvarying with time (when compared to g(x, y)). We can then integrate by parts\nto find\n[Hpointer , A(x)] ' \u2212i\u2202x0 A(x).\n\n(55)\n\nWith this approximation the J(x)A(x) interaction term will conserve a total\nenergy of the form\nZ\nHtotal = Hmatter + Hpointer + d3 xJ(x)A(x),\n(56)\nprovided that Hmatter satisfies [Hmatter , J(x)] = \u2212i\u2202x0 J(x).\nWe expect the collapse terms in the equations of motion to result in nonconservation of energy since the collapse process should be able to randomly choose\nfrom a superposition of differing energy states. Given some operator O we can\nshow using equation (20) that its quantum expectation satisfies\ndx hOi\u03c3 = hdx Oi\u03c3 \u2212 ih[O, J(x)A(x)]i\u03c3 d\u03c9x\n\u2212 21 \u03bb2 h[N (x), [N (x), O]]i\u03c3 d\u03c9x\n+ \u03bbh{O, N (x)}i\u03c3 dBx \u2212 2\u03bbhOi\u03c3 hN (x)i\u03c3 dBx .\n\n16\n\n(57)\n\n\fFor example, setting O = Hmatter we find\ndx hHmatter i\u03c3 = \u2212 hA(x)\u2202x0 J(x)i\u03c3 d\u03c9x\n+ \u03bbh{Hmatter , N (x)}i\u03c3 dBx \u2212 2\u03bbhHmatter i\u03c3 hN (x)i\u03c3 dBx . (58)\nAny changes in energy described by equation (58) must be consistent with experimental bounds on energy conservation. This will result in bounds on the\nparameters of the model.\nFor the pointer field energy,\ndx hHpointer i\u03c3 ' \u2212 hJ(x)\u2202x0 A(x)i\u03c3 d\u03c9x\n\u2212 21 \u03bb2 h[N (x), [N (x), Hpointer ]]i\u03c3 d\u03c9x\n+ \u03bbh{Hpointer , N (x)}i\u03c3 dBx \u2212 2\u03bbhHpointer i\u03c3 hN (x)i\u03c3 dBx . (59)\nwhere we have made use of equation (55). To calculate the second term on the\nright side we use\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n[N (x), Hpointer ] = d\u03c9y f (x, y) i\u2202x0 a\u2020 (x) a(x) + a\u2020 (x) (i\u2202x0 a(x)) , (60)\nwhich in turn can be used to show that\n[N (x), [N (x), Hpointer ]] = 0.\n\n(61)\n\nThere are no divergences in the rates of change of either Hmatter or Hpointer .\nThere is exchange of energy between the two fields driven by the J(x)A(x)\ninteraction but the collapse process conserves total energy in expectation.\nLet us briefly consider how this model is affected by letting the smearing\nfunction f become a delta function. In this case we have N (x) = n(x) and we\nfind\n\u0001\n[n(x), [n(x), Hpointer ]] = \u2212 i\u2202x0 a\u2020 (x) a(x)\u03b4 4 (0) + a\u2020 (x) (i\u2202x0 a(x)) \u03b4 4 (0). (62)\nThe pointer field energy therefore changes at an infinite rate due to the collapse dynamics. It can also be shown that taking g(x, y) = \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y) leads to\ndivergences for the matter field energy.\n\n8\n\nNumerical calculation in 2D\n\nIn order to understand the collapse dynamics in more detail we consider a numerical solution of the state evolution in the simplified case of a 2D spacetime\n(one space and one time dimension). We use the example of an initial superposition of two different matter density states.\nConsider the state |Ji i|\u03b1i i where in the rest frame of the matter field we\nhave\n(\nJi |Ji i for li < x1 < ui ,\nJ(x1 , x0 )|Ji i =\n(63)\n0\notherwise,\n\n17\n\n\f5000\n\nE{int[dx_1 Var(N(x_1))]}\nint[dx_1 Var(N(x_1))] example\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\n\n0.0005\n\n0.001\n\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\n0.0025\n\n0.003\n\nx_0\n\nFigure\nNumerical demonstration\nof the collapse process. The variable\n\u0002R 2:\n\u0003\nEP dx1 Var\u03c3 [N (x1 , x0 )] tends to zero as the system evolves indicating that\nonly one of the N -eigenstates survives. An example path highlights the stochastic nature of a typical realized process.\n\nwhere li and ui are constant lower and upper bounds respectively of the spatial extent of the matter density. Assuming a sufficiently large value for the\neigenvalue Ji we can make the approximation (see section 6)\nN (x1 , x0 )|\u03b1i i ' Ni (x1 , x0 )|\u03b1i i.\n\n(64)\n\nWe further assume that the length scale associated with f and g is sufficiently\nsmall (compared to length scales ui \u2212 li and their overlaps) that we can approximate equations (33) and (37) to give\n(\nJi2 for li < x1 < ui ,\nNi (x1 , x0 ) =\n(65)\n0\notherwise.\nThe pointer field thus provides an image of the matter field state.\nSuppose that the state of the system following some interaction between\nmatter field and pointer field is\n|\u03a8(\u03c3)i = c1 |J1 i|\u03b11 i + c2 |J2 i|\u03b12 i.\n\n(66)\n\nIn the rest frame we consider matter density states which are nonzero only in\nthe following regions: l1 = \u22121; u1 = 0 and l2 = 0; u2 = 1. This corresponds to\nan initial superposition of two adjacent lumps of matter.\n18\n\n\fWe can solve equation (20) numerically for this two-state example. Since the\n|\u03b1i i are approximate eigenstates of the operator N (x1 , x0 ), the state dynamics\nreduces to the dynamics of the two coefficients c1 and c2 (taken to be initially\nequal in our simulation). For simplicity the state evolution is considered only\nin terms of a foliation of constant x0 surfaces. The stochastic coupling \u03bb is set\nto be equal to 0.5 and Ji2 is 100 for both i = 1, 2.\nIn order to characterize the collapse process we use the quantity\nZ\ndx1 Var\u03c3 [N (x1 , x0 )].\n(67)\nAs this quantity tends to zero then the state must tend to a N (x1 , x0 )-eigenstate\nfor all x1 . Figure 2 shows how the P-expectation of (67) decreases as the system\nevolves. The P-expectation is calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using 200\nsample paths. An example path is shown in the figure to highlight the stochastic\nnature of the realized process.\nSince the P-expectation of (67) tends to zero then the realized quantum\nvariance of N must with certainty tend to zero. The state ends up in the\n\u221a form\n|\u03a8(\u03c3)i = |Ji i|\u03b1i i. With initial conditions specified by c1 = c2 = 1/ 2 we\nfind that the proportion of occurrences of |\u03a8(\u03c3)i \u2192 |J1 i|\u03b11 i and |\u03a8(\u03c3)i \u2192\n|J2 i|\u03b12 i are even to within statistical error. The timescale for collapse is of\norder 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 (in units defined by the chosen parameters). This is well\napproximated by the formula \u03c4coll \u223c \u03bb\u22122 V4\u22121 J \u22124 .\n\n9\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this article we have outlined a framework for describing the evolution of\nrelativistic quantum systems which consistently explains the behavior of both\nmicroscopic and macroscopic systems. To do this the model incorporates quantum state reduction into the standard state dynamics in a way which is not only\ncovariant and frame independent, but also objective, naturally differentiating\nbetween systems of different scale and adjusting its effect accordingly. In this\nway the model offers a potential unification of quantum and classical sectors.\nWithin this framework no judgment is required on when to apply collapse\nand when to apply unitary evolution (as with orthodox quantum theory) and it\nis not necessary to perform an arbitrary separation of system and environment\nin order to understand its decoherence properties. The present model leads to\nthe prediction of well defined observer independent local properties.\nThe mechanism can be used to describe collapse in any quantum field for\nwhich we can form a Lorentz invariant scalar current J(x). This applies to\nboth fermions and bosons. There is no incompatibility with the inclusion of\ngauge field interactions and there are therefore no problems in principle with\napplication to the standard model of particle physics. (We note that the model\nof Tumulka [14], although of interest as a demonstration of a consistent and\nformally rigorous relativistic collapse model, applies only to a fixed number\nof noninteracting quantum particles. To consider any interesting correlations\n19\n\n\fbetween particle states in this model they must be encoded in the initial state\nvector.)\nThe present model has features with the potential for experimental scrutiny.\nFor example, the expected rates of collapse show a dependence on the specific\nsystem details; local properties of the theory exhibit a well defined stochasticity;\nand there is energy transfer between the quantum fields and the pointer field.\nBy quantifying these effects it is hoped that new tests of quantum theory may\nbe suggested.\nAcknowledgments.
