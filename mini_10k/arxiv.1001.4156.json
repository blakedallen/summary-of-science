ABDOLLAHI & H. KHOSRAVI\nAbstract. We prove that the set of right 4-Engel elements of a group G is\na subgroup for locally nilpotent groups G without elements of orders 2, 3 or\n5; and in this case the normal closure hxiG is nilpotent of class at most 7 for\neach right 4-Engel elements x of G.\n\n1. Introduction and Results\nLet G be any group and n a non-negative integer. For any two elements a and\nb of G, we define inductively [a,n b] the n-Engel commutator of the pair (a, b), as\nfollows:\n[a,0 b] := a, [a, b] = [a,1 b] := a\u22121 b\u22121 ab and [a,n b] = [[a,n\u22121 b], b] for all n > 0.\nAn element x of G is called right n-Engel if [x,n g] = 1 for all g \u2208 G. We denote\nby Rn (G) the set of all right n-Engel elements of G. A group G is called n-Engel if\nG = Rn (G). It is clear that R1 (G) = Z(G) is the center of G and W.P. Kappe [5]\nproved R2 (G) is a characteristic subgroup of G. Macdonald [6] has shown that the\ninverse or square of a right 3-Engel element need not be right 3-Engel. Nickel [8]\ngeneralized Macdonald's result to all n \u2265 3. Although Macdonald's example shows\nthat R3 (G) is not in general a subgroup of G, Heineken [4] has already shown that\nif A is the subset of a group G consisting of all elements a such that a\u00b11 \u2208 R3 (G),\nthen A is a subgroup if either G has no element of order 2 or A consists only of\nelements having finite odd order. Newell [7] proved that the normal closure of every\nright 3-Engel element is nilpotent of class at most 3. In Section 2 we prove that\nif G is a 2\u2032 -group, then R3 (G) is a subgroup of G. Nickel's example shows that\nthe set of right 4-Engel elements is not a subgroup in general (see also the first\nexample in Section 4 of [1]). In Section 3, we prove that if G is a locally nilpotent\n{2, 3, 5}\u2032-group, then R4 (G) is a subgroup of G.\nTraustason [11] proved that any locally nilpotent 4-Engel group H is Fitting of\ndegree at most 4. This means that the normal closure of every element of H is\nnilpotent of class at most 4. More precisely he proved that if H has no element\nof order 2 or 5, then H has Fitting degree at most 3. Now by a result of Havas\nand Vaughan-Lee [3], one knows any 4-Engel group is locally nilpotent and so\nTraustason's result is true for all 4-Engel groups. In Section 3, by another result of\nTraustason [12] we show that the normal closure of every right 4-Engel element in\na locally nilpotent {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group, is nilpotent of class at most 7.\nThroughout the paper we have frequently used nq package of Werner Nickel [9]\nwhich is implemented in GAP [10].

Right 3-Engel elements\nThroughout, for any positive integer k and any group H, \u03b3k (H) denotes the kth\nterm of the lower central series of H. The main result of this section implies that\nR3 (G) is a subgroup of G whenever G is a 2\u2032 -group. Newell [7] proved that\nTheorem 2.1. Let G = ha, b, ci be a group such that a, b \u2208 R3 (G). Then\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nha, ci is nilpotent of class at most 5 and \u03b35 (ha, ci) has exponent 2.\nG is nilpotent of class at most 6.\n\u03b35 (G)/\u03b36 (G) has exponent 10. Furthermore [a, c, b, c, c]2 \u2208 \u03b36 (G).\n\u03b36 (G) has exponent 2.\n\nTheorem 2.2. Let G be a group such that \u03b35 (G) has no element of order 2. Then\nR3 (G) is a subgroup of G.\nProof. Let a, b \u2208 R3 (G) and let c be an arbitrary element of G. Thus\n(1) [a, c, c, c] = 1.\n(2) [b, c, c, c] = 1.\nSince by our assumption \u03b35 (G) has no element of order 2, it follows from Theorem\n2.1 parts (1), (3) and (4), respectively that\n(3) the subgroup ha, ci is nilpotent of class at most 4.\n(4) [a, c, b, c, c] = 1.\n(5) the subgroup ha, b, ci is nilpotent of class at most 5.\nTo prove R3 (G) is a subgroup, we have to show that both a\u22121 and ab belong to\nR3 (G). We first prove that a\u22121 \u2208 R3 (G). It easily follows from (1) and (3) that:\n[a\u22121 , c, c, c] = [a, c, c, c]\u22121 = 1.\nTherefore a\u22121 \u2208 R3 (G).\nWe now show that ab \u2208 R3 (G).\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[ab, c, c, c] = [a, c][a, c, b][b, c], c, c\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0003\n\u0002\n= [a, c, c][a,c,b][b,c] [a, c, b][b, c], c , c\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= [a, c, c][b,c] [a, c, b, c][b,c][b, c, c], c by (5)\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\n= [a, c, c] a, c, c, [b, c] [a, c, b, c][b, c, c], c by (5)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= [a, c, b, c][b, c, c], c by (1) and (5)\n=\n\n[a, c, b, c, c][b,c,c] by (2)\n\n=\n\n1 by (4)\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow we give a proof of Theorem 2.2 by using nq package of Werner Nickel [9]\nwhich is implemented in GAP [10]. Note that the knowledge of Theorem 2.1 is\ncrucial in the following proof. The package nq has the capability of computing the\nlargest nilpotent quotient (if it exists) of a finitely generated group with finitely\nmany identical relations and finitely many relations. For example, if we want to\nconstruct the largest nilpotent quotient of a group G as follows\nhx1 , . . . , xn | r1 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = rm (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 1, w(x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yk ) = 1i,\n\n\fRIGHT 4-ENGEL ELEMENTS\n\n3\n\nwhere r1 , . . . , rm are relations on x1 , . . . , xn and w(x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yk ) = 1 is an\nidentical relation in the group hx1 , . . . , xn i, one may apply the following code to\nuse the package nq in GAP:\nLoadPackage(\"nq\"); #nq package of Werner Nickel #\nF:=FreeGroup(n+k);\nL:=F/[r1(F.1,...,F.n),...,rm(F.1,...,F.n),w(F.1,...,F.n,F.(n+1),...,F.(n+k))];\nH:=NilpotentQuotient(L,[F.(n+1),...,F.(n+k)]);\nNote that we need to construct the free group of rank n + k because as well as the\nn generators for G we also have an identical relation with k free variables.\nNote that the function NilpotentQuotient(L) attempts to compute the largest nilpotent quotient of L and it will terminate only if L has a largest nilpotent quotient.\nSecond Proof of Theorem 2.2. By Theorem 2.1, we know that hx, y, zi is\nnilpotent if x, y \u2208 R3 (G) and z \u2208 G. We now construct the largest nilpotent group\nH = ha, b, ci such that a, b \u2208 R3 (H) and c \u2208 H, by nq package.\nLoadPackage(\"nq\");\nF:=FreeGroup(4);a1:=F.1; b1:=F.2; c1:=F.3; x:=F.4;\nL:=F/[LeftNormedComm([a1,x,x,x]),LeftNormedComm([b1,x,x,x])];\nH:=NilpotentQuotient(L,[x]);\na:=H.1; b:=H.2; c:=H.3; d:=LeftNormedComm([a^{-1},c,c,c]);\ne:=LeftNormedComm([a*b,c,c,c]); Order(d); Order(e);\nC:=LowerCentralSeries(H); d in C[5]; e in C[5];\nThen if we consider the elements d = [a\u22121 , c, c, c] and e = [ab, c, c, c] of H, we can\nsee by above command in GAP that d and e are elements of \u03b35 (H) and have orders\n2 and 4, respectively. So, in the group G, we have d = e = 1. This completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\nNote that, the second proof of Theorem 2.2 also shows the necessity of assuming\nthat \u03b35 (G) has no element of order 2.\n3. Right 4-Engel elements\nOur main result in this section is to prove the following.\nTheorem 3.1. Let G be a {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group such that ha, b, xi is nilpotent for all\na, b \u2208 R4 (G) and any x \u2208 G. Then R4 (G) is a subgroup of G.\nProof. Consider the 'freest' group, denoted by U , generated by two elements u,v\nwith u a right 4-Engel element. We mean this by the group U given by the presentation\nhu, v | [u,4 x] = 1 for all words x \u2208 F2 i,\nwhere F2 is the free group generated by u and v. We do not know whether U\nis nilpotent or not. Using the nq package shows that the group U has a largest\nnilpotent quotient M with class 8. By the following code, the group M generated\nby a right 4-Engel element a and an arbitrary element c is constructed. We then see\nthat the element [a\u22121 , c, c, c, c] of M is of order 375 = 3 \u00d7 53 . Therefore the inverse\nof a right 4-Engel element of G is again a right 4-Engel element. The following code\nin GAP gives a proof of the latter claim. The computation was completed in about\n24 seconds.\n\n\f4\n\nABDOLLAHI AND KHOSRAVI\n\nF:=FreeGroup(3); a1:=F.1; b1:=F.2; x:=F.3;\nU:=F/[LeftNormedComm([a1,x,x,x,x])];\nM:=NilpotentQuotient(U,[x]);\na:=M.1; c:=M.2;\nh:=LeftNormedComm([a^-1,c,c,c,c]);\nOrder(h);\nWe now show that the product of every two right 4-Engel elements in G is a right\n4-Engel element. Let a, b \u2208 R4 (G) and c \u2208 G. Then we claim that\nH = ha, b, ci is nilpotent of class at most 7. (\u2217)\nBy induction on the nilpotency class of H, we may assume that H is nilpotent of\nclass at most 8. Now we construct the largest nilpotent group K = ha1 , b1 , c1 i of\nclass 8 such that a1 , b1 \u2208 R4 (K).\nF:=FreeGroup(4);A:=F.1; B:=F.2; C:=F.3; x:=F.4;\nW:=F/[LeftNormedComm([A,x,x,x,x]),LeftNormedComm([B,x,x,x,x])];\nK:=NilpotentQuotient(W,[x],8);\nLowerCentralSeries(K);\nThe computation took about 22.7 hours. We see that \u03b38 (K) has exponent 60.\nTherefore, as H is a {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group, we have \u03b38 (H) = 1 and this completes the\nproof of our claim (\u2217).\nTherefore we have proved that any nilpotent group without elements of orders 2, 3\nor 5 which is generated by three elements two of which are right 4-Engel, is nilpotent\nof class at most 7.\nNow we construct, by the nq package, the largest nilpotent group S of class 7\ngenerated by two right 4-Engel elements s, t and an arbitrary element g. Then one\ncan find by GAP that the order of [st, g, g, g, g] in S is 300. Since H is a quotient\nof S, we have that [ab, c, c, c, c] is of order dividing 300 and so it is trivial, since H\nis a {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.2. Let G be a {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group such that ha, b, xi is nilpotent for all\na, b \u2208 R4 (G) and for any x \u2208 G. Then R4 (G) is a nilpotent group of class at most\n7. In particular, the normal closure of every right 4-Engel element of group G is\nnilpotent of class at most 7.\nProof. By Theorem 3.1, R4 (G) is a subgroup of G and so it is a 4-Engel group. In\n[12] it is shown that every locally nilpotent 4-Engel {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group is nilpotent of\nclass at most 7. Therefore R4 (G) is nilpotent of class at most 7. Since R4 (G) is a\nnormal set, the second part follows easily.\n\u0003\nTherefore, to prove that the normal closure of any right 4-Engel element of a\n{2, 3, 5}\u2032-group G is nilpotent, it is enough to show that ha, b, xi is nilpotent for all\na, b \u2208 R4 (G) and for any x \u2208 G.\nCorollary 3.3. In any {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group, the normal closure of any right 4-Engel\nelement is nilpotent if and only if every 3-generator subgroup in which two of the\ngenerators can be chosen to be right 4-Engel, is nilpotent.\nProof. By Corollary 3.2, it is enough to show that a {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group H = ha, b, xi\nis nilpotent whenever a, b \u2208 R4 (H), x \u2208 H and both haiH and hbiH are nilpotent.\nConsider the subgroup K = haiH hbiH which is nilpotent by Fitting's theorem. Now\n\n\fRIGHT 4-ENGEL ELEMENTS\n\n5\n\nwe prove that K is finitely generated. We have K = ha, bihxi and since a and b are\nboth right 4-Engel, it is well-known that\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\nhaihxi = ha, ax , ax , ax i and hbihxi = hb, bx , bx , bx i,\nand so\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\nK = ha, ax , ax , ax , b, bx , bx , bx i.\nIt follows that H satisfies maximal condition on its subgroups as it is (finitely\ngenerated nilpotent)-by-cyclic. Now by a famous result of Baer [2] we have that a\nand b lie in the (m + 1)th term \u03b6m (H) of the upper central series of H for some\npositive integer m. Hence H/\u03b6m (H) is cyclic and so H is nilpotent. This completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nWe conclude this section with the following interesting information on the group\nM in the proof of Theorem 3.1. In fact, for the largest nilpotent group M = ha, bi\nrelative to a \u2208 R4 (M ), we have that M/T is isomorphic to the largest (nilpotent)\n2-generated 4-Engel group E(2, 4), where T is the torsion subgroup of M which is\na {2, 3, 5}-group. Therefore, in a nilpotent {2, 3, 5}\u2032-group, a right 4-Engel element\nwith an arbitrary element generate a 4-Engel group. This can be seen by comparing\nthe presentations of M/T and E(2, 4) as follows. One can obtain two finitely\npresented groups G1 and G2 isomorphic to M/T and E(2, 4), respectively by GAP:\nMoverT:=FactorGroup(M,TorsionSubgroup(M));\nE24:=NilpotentEngelQuotient(FreeGroup(2),4);\niso1:=IsomorphismFpGroup(MoverT);iso2:=IsomorphismFpGroup(E24);\nG1:=Image(iso1);G2:=Image(iso2);\nNext, we find the relators of the groups G1 and G2 which are two sets of relators\non 13 generators by the following command in GAP.\nr1:=RelatorsOfFpGroup(G1);r2:=RelatorsOfFpGroup(G2);\nNow, save these two sets of relators by LogTo command of GAP in a file and go to\nthe file to delete the terms as\n<identity ...>\nin the sets r1 and r2. Now call these two modified sets R1 and R2. We show that\nR1=R2 as two sets of elements of the free group f on 13 generators f1,f2,...,f13.\nf:=FreeGroup(13);\nf1:=f.1;f2:=f.2;f3:=f.3;f4:=f.4;f5:=f.5;f6:=f.6;\nf7:=f.7;f8:=f.8;f9:=f.9;f10:=f.11;f12:=f.12;f13:=f.13;\nNow by Read function, load the file in GAP and type the simple command R1=R2.\nThis gives us true which shows G1 and G2 are two finitely presented groups with\nthe same relators and generators and so they are isomorphic. We do not know if\nthere is a guarantee that if someone else does as we did, then he/she finds the same\nrelators for Fp groups G1 and G2, as we have found. Also we remark that using\nfunction IsomorphismGroups to test if G1 \u223c\n= G2 , did not give us a result in less than\n10 hours and we do not know whether this function can give us a result or not.\nWe summarize the above discussion as following.\nTheorem 3.4. Let G be a nilpotent group generated by two elements, one of which\nis a right 4-Engel element. If G has no element of order 2, 3 or 5, then G is a\n4-Engel group of class at most 6.\n\n\f6\n\nABDOLLAHI AND KHOSRAVI\n\nAcknowledgments.
