An intense activity is currently devoted to the fundamental\nunderstanding of DW motion driven by either magnetic field or spin-polarized current, with\nthe technological aim and fundamental need for understanding how to reach high mobilities\n(high speed with low field or low current).\nUnderstanding and controlling the motion of domain-walls and vortices first requires a good\nknowledge of their internal micromagnetic structure. This structure is associated with one\nor more degrees of freedom (DoF ). For instance the core of a magnetic vortex can exhibit\na magnetization in an up or down state, that may be switched by a magnetic field [5] or\nspin-polarized currents [6]. The internal structure of vortices and DWs is best studied in\ndots displaying a flux-closure state, because it is stabilized in its center owing to the self\ndipolar field [7]. The core orientation of the magnetic vortex combined with the chirality\n(clockwise or anticlockwise) of the flux closure, define two DoF , that can be considered\nas bits in terms of data storage. Many studies have been devoted to disks with these two\nDoF [8\u201310]. Recently elongated dots with three DoF (two in the central Bloch domain wall,\none in the chirality) were demonstrated, first in self-assembled dots [11] then extended to\nspin-valve dots [12].\nOwing to its high lateral resolution and video capture rate, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM - and its associated magnetic imaging technique Lorentz Microscopy LTEM) is a powerful tool to scrutinize the inner structure of magnetic objects such as\nvortex arrays [13], vortices [14] or Bloch lines [15]. The resolution capacities below 10 nm\n[16] associated to a bulk magnetic sensitivity are of great interest for such fine analysis. Furthermore, in-situ experiments (few tens of millisecond temporal resolution) can be carried\nout to monitor in real time these magnetic objects.\nThe purpose of the present manuscript is to analyse flux-closure states in micron-sized selfassembled dots via Lorentz microscopy, both under static conditions and while monitoring\nthe quasi-static switching of internal degrees of freedom of the DW. It is illustrated how\nadvanced image processing of experimental data combined with post-processing of micromagnetic calculations are crucial in getting the highest possible resolution and information\n2\n\n\fout of experimental data. Moreover, such micromagnetic knowledge of the DW is used to\nanalyse the sensitivity of Lorentz microscopy. Section II describes the system under study\nand the experimental set-up. Section III is devoted to a simple analysis of Fresnel contrast used to retrieve quantitative information on the magnetic width of the DW and its\ncomparison to micromagnetic modelling. Section IV deals with a detailed analysis of the\nphase retrieval approach based on Fresnel contrast to retrieve quantitative informations on\nboth integrated magnetic induction and domain wall width. New possibilities offered by\nhigh-resolution Fresnel contrast analysis are illustrated in the last section by the real-time\nmonitoring of a magnetization process inside the DW itself, based on the propagation of a\nsurface vortex of diameter roughly 10 nm.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe nanostructures studied in this paper are micron-sized iron Fe(110) dots, synthesized\nusing Pulsed-Laser Deposition under Ultra-High Vacuum conditions. The supporting surface\nis a 10 nm-thick W layer epitaxially-grown on 350 micron-thick Sapphire (112\u03040) wafers.\nThese dots are faceted because they are single-crystalline and display low Miller indices\ncrystallographic planes. Their elongated shape is due to the uniaxial anisotropy of the\n(110) surface. Details about the sample growth can be found elsewhere [17]. Such dots\nhave been extensively characterized during the past ten years by means of micromagnetic\nsimulations [18, 19], MFM observations [18], X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism PhotoEmission Electron Microscopy [20] and magnetotransport [21]. The micromagnetic structure\nof such dots is sketched in Figure 1 and can be described as follows.\nAbove a lateral size of roughly 250 nm and thickness larger than 50 nm the magnetostatic\nenergy of the dot is so large that it displays spontaneously a flux closure magnetic distribution\n(Fig. 1-(a)). Several types of flux-closure states exist in such dots [22, 23]. The simplest\nof these is the combination of two main domains, antiparallel one to another and oriented\nalong the long dimension of the dot. A Bloch wall of finite length and width lies at the\nboundary of these two domains (Fig. 1-(b)). Smaller domains oriented essentially along the\nin-plane short axis of the dot are located at its ends to enable the magnetic flux to close.\nThe detailed inner structure of the Bloch wall is asymmetric [24, 25]. It is composed of a\nmain out-of-plane magnetization area and two opposites so-called N\u00e9el Caps (NCs) occurring\n3\n\n\fFigure 1. (Colour online) Scheme of the magnetization distribution in a single-crystalline elongated\nand faceted iron (110) dot. (a) Overview of the flux closure distribution in the dot. The two coloured\nplanes are referring to the two following views. (b) Transverse section of the dot. The magnetic\nconfiguration of the asymmetric Bloch wall can be seen. The two N\u00e9el Caps are highlighted in red.\n(c) Longitudinal section of the dot. The overall finite Bloch wall is described here. Surface vortices\nare highlighted in green, as the two NCs are drawn in red.\n\nat each surface of the dot with opposite in-plane magnetization (see Fig. 1-(b)) [26]. At\neach end of the finite Bloch wall one finds a surface vortex enabling the magnetic flux to\nescape (in green on Fig. 1-(c)). These two vortices are unavoidable based on topological\narguments for a flux-closure dot [27]. Thus three DoF exist in an elongated dot : the vertical\npolarity of the DW, the chirality of the flux-closure and the transverse polarity of Ncs couple\n(an information equivalent with the position of the two surface vortices). The controlled\nmagnetic switching of this third DoF was demonstrated recently [11, 21].\nMicromagnetic simulations were performed using a custom-developed code based on a\nfinite-differences scheme (prismatic cells) [19]. Here both a 3D and a 2D version of the code\n4\n\n\fwere used. The former permits the accurate description of the complex magnetic structure\narising in three-dimensional structures, while the latter allows to address simple cases such\nas an infinitely-long domain wall, and thus extract the essentials of the physics at play.\nWe used the bulk magnetic parameters for Fe : exchange A = 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 J/m, fourth-order\nmagnetic anisotropy K = 4.8 \u00d7 104 J/m3 , and magnetization Ms = 1.73 \u00d7 106 A/m.\nTwo microscopes were used for Lorentz Microscopy : a JEOL 3010 with a thermionic\nelectron gun and a FEI Titan fitted in with a Schottky gun. Both of them are working at\n300kV and are fitted with a Gatan Imaging Filter for zero loss filtering [28] and thickness\nmapping [29]. The Titan is also equipped with a dedicated Lorentz lens for high resolution\nmagnetic field-free imaging while the JEOL is fitted with a conventional objective minilens initially dedicated to low magnification imaging. In-situ experiments were performed\nusing the field produced by the objective lens of the microscope (previously calibrated using\ndedicated sample holders mounted with a Hall probe). The sample was then tilted to produce\nan in-plane magnetic field. Magnetic field values provided in that manuscript refer to the\nin-plane component of the field with respect to the tilt angle. Sample was prepared using\na mechanical polishing and ion milling. Phase retrieval using the Transport of Intensity\nequation [30] was thus coupled to substrate contribution removal as proposed in [31].\nAll observations presented here are based on Fresnel contrast [32] of LTEM. Considering\ngeometrical optics, its formation results from the overlap of two parts of the electron beam\nexperiencing two different Lorentz forces. An image formed slightly over- or underfocused\nthen results in bright or dark lines, highlighting the domain walls position. In the case of\na coherent electron source where electrons have to be described as waves and no more as\nparticles, the contrast give rise to interference patterns in overlapping areas (such images are\nsubsequently often denoted in-line holograms). This interference pattern contains further\ninformations about the DW inner structure as it will be explained in the last section.\nThe sample geometry was chosen to reveal the Bloch wall contrast in Fresnel images (see\nFig.3). Electron are thus crossing the sample perpendicularly to the magnetic domains\nof the dot and parallelly to the Bloch wall magnetization. Fig. 2 presents four different\nflux-closure states. These maps were built using the phase retrieval approach of the Transport of Intensity Equation [30] linking the phase gradient in the observation plane to the\nintensity variation along the optical axis. The reconstructed phase contains an electrostatic\nand a magnetic component [33] that we discuss hereafter. Due to the observed flux closure\n5\n\n\fstates we reliably make the approximation that the magnetic signal can be associated to\nthe integrated magnetization inside the dots thus neglecting any significant demagnetizing\nfield.\nTo retrieve quantitative magnetic information by suppressing the electrostatic contribution\nseveral techniques are known and are reviewed in [34]. The first technique we used is\ndescribed in [31] and enables to get rid of the electrostatic contribution of the substrate\nconsidering a constant gradient of substrate thickness. A value of 150\u00b150 nm.T for the\nintegrated magnetic induction was found where the two surfaces of the dot are parallel and\nthe electrostatic contribution of the dot vanishes (i.e. between the facets and the Bloch\nwall - see dashed area in Fig. 2-(a)). Considering an experimental thickness of 70 nm\n(estimated with the log-ratio technique [29] using a value of the inelastic mean free path\nof 80 nm for iron at 300 kV), this value is in good agreement with the bulk iron saturated\nmagnetization (\u03bc0 Ms = 2.17 T). On the other hand, a second method is to reverse the\nchirality of the dot by an applied field [35]. We perform a subtraction of two phase shifts\nwith an opposite magnetic contribution but the same electrostatic contribution. In that\ncase both contributions are differentiated. A value of 140\u00b150 nm.T was found for the integrated magnetization in the dot and a thickness of 80\u00b120 nm was also confirmed analysing\nthe electrostatic part (assuming a 22 V potential for iron). Eventually, a third procedure\nusing a 180\u25e6 reversal of the TEM sample (outside of the microscope) was used leading to\nthe same value. Such method is more convenient to use as it is possible to analyse more\ncomplex magnetic structures. Analysing the central part of the diamond configuration\n(Fig. 2-(b)) where the dot is undoubtedly uniformly magnetized could thus be carried out\nto confirm our previous results. An integrated magnetization of 220\u00b150 nm.T was found\nwhich confirms our previous measurements. Giving an experimental thickness of 100 nm finally leads to an experimental value of the magnetization in iron : Ms = 1.7 \u00b10.4 \u00d7106 A/m.\n\nOther magnetic distributions (Fig. 2-(b-d)) can be viewed as double, triple and quadruple\nLandau (or also under the generic name of diamond states [18]), the prefix referring to the\nnumber of Bloch walls or vortices (if the domain wall collapses due to a too small length)\ninside the dot. Any of these configurations may be prepared regarding the shape of the dot\nand its magnetic history. It may be used to favour the occurrence of one or another type of\nstate. As a general rule a saturation magnetic field (between 2 and 3 T) applied perfectly\n6\n\n\fperpendicular to the dot (along z) yields a Landau state, whereas higher order states are\nobtained upon applying the field with a combination of an azimuthal and polar angle. Such\nmulti-walled structure can be of fundamental use for wall length study as demonstrated in\n[36].\n\nIII.\n\nFRESNEL CONTRAST ANALYSIS\n\nFig. 3 displays three images taken for different defocus values. The 180\u25e6 Bloch wall\ninduces a bright line in the middle of the dot. At both extremities of this line weaker bright\nlines emerge due to N\u00e9el walls (more easily seen on high defocused images as Fig. 3-c). The\nbrighter spots found at each extremity of the Bloch DW arises from the locally high curl of\nmagnetization and are not linked to surface vortices presented in Fig. 1-c.\nThis contrast can be used to assess the width of the Bloch wall. We used the zero-defocus\napproximation that consists of a linear regression for a focal series of domain wall contrast\nwidth measurement [37]. This old fashioned [38] method has been widely used, commented\nand criticized in the past. We rely here on the validity of the method regarding the large\nwidth (well above 10 nm) [39] and asymmetry [40] of the domain walls studied in the present\nwork. Moreover, the main goal here is to compare the measured width with a real micromagnetic case to understand the meaning of such a method. The width of the convergent\nwall (i.e. the width measured in Fresnel contrast) is estimated by taking the width of the\ninterference pattern, namely the distance between the two outermost bright fringes (see Fig.\n3-(d)). The extreme bright fringes are chosen when there are visible on both side of the\nmain center bright line and when their intensity is more than 5 % the center fringe intensity.\nWe found a value of 45\u00b15 nm for the asymmetric Bloch wall width.\n\nTo understand the signification of this value, we used our 2D micromagnetic code considering infinitely long (in the y direction) iron (110) bars with a thickness over width ratio\nof 0.2 which is a typical experimental value. Due firstly to the four-fold magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy, and secondly to the three-dimensional nature of the system, the domain wall\nwidth cannot be easily defined by a tangent like in the text-book case [41]. Choosing the\nmost suitable definition of a DW width is mandatory for the analysis of both experiments\nand simulations. We decided to use the formula described e.g. by Hubert [42] integrating\n7\n\n\fover the \u03b8 angle corresponding to the magnetization orientation with respect to the wall\ndirection (y) (both magnetization variations along x and z are described in Fig. 4-(a-b)):\nZ \u221e\n\u03b4w =\nsin \u03b8x dx\n(1)\n0\n\nThis formula enables a clear bounding of the domain wall with two zeros values. Nevertheless\nit still can be integrated or averaged over the thickness of the dot (i.e. along the z direction),\nor applied at any height, the surface and middle-height being of particular interest. Fig.\n4-(c) presents resulting values of width measurements considering various descriptions given\nhereafter. Several comments can be made on these results. In the low thickness regime, for\nany definition the DW width fits roughly linearly with the thickness. In that case one often\nuses the name of vortex wall for the obvious reason of curling of magnetization in the (x,z)\nplane (Fig. 4-(b)). The DW width seems hardly to saturate for large thickness, whereas for\n200 nm a steady value was nearly reached by Rave and Hubert [43]. This probably because\nthey used a much larger uniaxial anisotropy value than the one in Fe, yielding narrower\ndomain walls. This steady width is much smaller than 200 nm in their case, so that bulk\nproperties are already reached. In our case the bulk wall width is larger and the DW is still\ngeometrically constrained at 200 nm thickness and ever more below (Fig. 4-(a)).\nAside the DW, we observe an area with a small volume of vertical magnetization with a\nsign opposite to that of the core of the DW (see z-maps on Fig. 4-(a-b)). Whereas this was\nalready visible in the early simulations of Hubert [24] and LaBonte [25], this antiparallel\nvolume is nearly absent in the extensive calculations reported more recently because again\nof the choice of a high value of anisotropy [44, 45]. The presence of this small volume implies\na more careful description of how the domain wall width should be defined : with or without\ntaking this volume into account. Two distinct approaches can be used considering (\u03b4\u2191\u2193 ) or\nnot (\u03b4\u2191 ) this opposite component of the wall (i.e. when mz 6 0, see also Fig. 1-(b)). As\nan illustration, Fig. 4-(c) shows the mean DW width computed from Eq. 1 and integrated\nover the thickness for both cases. The results show large differences with the full integral\ncalculation showing that care should be taken when discussing the width of such walls.\nExperimentally it is found that for a thickness of 70 nm the width is \u03b4 = 45 nm. This value\nfits better with the mean \u03b4w definition which is coherent with the integration along the\nelectron path which is made when using Lorentz microscopy. Therefore such a description is\nnot well suited to describe the width of complex asymmetric Bloch DWs. Nevertheless this\n8\n\n\fmeasurement gives useful information on the wall profile as the inner width can be estimated\nwith respect to the measured average value. We will see in the last part of that study how\nit is possible to analyse carefully Fresnel contrast to obtain more spatial information on the\nmagnetization distribution in such walls.\n\nCombination of experimental width measurement with micromagnetic simulation is thus\nmandatory to explain what is obtained during LTEM analysis. In the present work, an\nexperimental quantitative value for the wall width was obtained but it was clear that neither a wall profile nor a wall description could be extracted by a simple contrast analysis.\nMicromagnetic simulation was thus an unavoidable tool we used to translate our findings\nin terms of magnetic length. Main result of such a work is that domain wall width measurement using LTEM cannot be reduced to an experimental snapshot and requires a good\nmicromagnetic description (and not a simple text-book approximation) before conclusions\ncan be made.\n\nIV.\n\nPHASE-SHIFT ANALYSIS\n\nAs TIE approach is based on defocused images we did not expect a better resolution in\nmeasuring the domain wall width by such a method. However a phase shift is known to\ncontain more information than a simple Fresnel image (which is definitely true regarding\nout-of-axis in-focus holography, but impossible to implement in that case due to the large\ndimensions of the structures). We performed wall width measurements using a phase shift\ngradient along x yielding to a m\u0304y * t map, m\u0304y being the component along y of the integrated\nmagnetization and t the local magnetic thickness. Such values were then normalized between\n+1 and -1 to approximate the cosine of the wall angle (see Fig. 5-(a)). We then estimate\np\nthe sinus used in Eq. 1 by taking the real part of 1 \u2212 (m\u0304y * t)2 . An advantage of such\n\ndescription is to avoid experimental fluctuations around the maximum value of m\u0304y * t. We\nfinally found a value of 54 \u00b1 10 nm for domain wall width which is in accordance with the\n\nzero-defocus estimation. The small over-estimation could be explained by the use of an\nout-of-focus method and thus linked to the defocalisation value used in TIE method.\np\nFig. 5-(c-d) presents a map of m\u0304 * t = (m\u0304x * t)2 + (m\u0304y * t)2 . The map is obtained from two\n9\n\n\fperpendicular phase gradients and contains a supplementary information on the third DoF\ndescribed above. This third DoF is carried by the chirality of the asymmetric Bloch wall.\nThus, m\u0304 * t decreases differently one side or another from the Bloch wall where m\u0304 * t vanishes\ndue to perpendicular magnetization. The two NCs are perfectly antiparallel and give no\nsignal in m\u0304 * t as they cancel one another. On the contrary, the presence of the small volume\nof vertical magnetization antiparallel to the wall magnetization (see Fig. 4-(a-b)) induces a\nlocal decrease of m\u0304 * t. In both experimental (Fig. 5-(c)) and simulated (bottom right inset\non same figure) cases, one can see an asymmetry in m\u0304*t profile (Fig. 5-(d)). This asymmetry\ngives a unambiguous information on the position of the antiparallel magnetization volume\nof the asymmetric Bloch wall thus leading to the chirality of the wall. Adding the wall\npolarity information that was recently proposed in [46] for vortices could lead to a complete\ndescription of the three DoF in such dots.\n\nV.\n\nFRESNEL CONTRAST EXPLORATION\n\nFrom a general point of view LTEM suffers from a limited sensitivity because an integration is made over the electron path. Here we demonstrate how the induced fringes of\na convergent wall can be analysed to yield highly-resolved information about the domain\nwalls. A comparison with micromagnetic modelling and contrast simulation is also given to\nconfirm our observations.\n\nWe focus on the process of reversal of N\u00e9el caps, mediated by the motion of a surface\nvortex along the length of the domain wall. One can find detailed information on the process\nin [11, 21]. One considers in that section that the surface vortex is a simple perturbation\nof the Bloch wall. Its displacement along the Bloch wall only slightly modifies the local\nmagnetization distribution. When increasing the defocus of the imaging lens, the overlap\nof the electrons coming from the neighbouring domains becomes wider and as a result the\nnumber of interference fringes increases. If the defocus value is high enough (namely close\nto a millimetre) the interference pattern can be compared to a small off-axis hologram [47],\nbearing a wealth of information. Inner details of the DW can then be derived from the\nanalysis of these fringes, such as the location of a surface vortex. The result is shown in Fig.\n6.\n10\n\n\fBoth original and amplitude images of the fringes are presented. The amplitude image corresponds to a wave reconstructed with the spatial frequency of the fringes and thus displays\nthe location of the fringes in the image. The first image taken at 32 mT is the starting\npoint of the series with the vortex located to the right side. On the following images the\nfringe perturbation created by the vortex displacement can be seen with the straight dark\nline in the amplitude image (highlighted with dashed circles on Fig. 6) indicating that the\nfringes are locally suppressed. The perturbation is moving from the right extremity (at 63,\n93 and 133 mT) along the domain wall and reaches its other extremity. The main transition\noccurs here between 133 and 136 mT. After this transition (above 150 mT), the perturbation\ndisappears and the wall exhibits a contrast similar to that observed on original images. The\nphenomenon is hysteretic and on the decreasing field series the magnetic switching happens\nbetween 123 and 121 mT. We note here that an extra feature appears on the amplitude\nimage at 136 mT (dark mark on the right of the wall). We are confident in the fact that\nsuch mark is an artefact of our method because nothing can be seen in the fringes. Moreover\nsuch feature is absent on other images. This could be associated to the curl of magnetization around the Bloch wall which is slightly modified during magnetization process (the\nmagnetization in the two main domains of the dot responds to the applied field) and which\nprevents from recording a prefect in-line hologram.\n\nA code to simulate Fresnel contrast from three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations\nwas developed. The tilt of the sample used for in-plane field application is modelled using\na barycentre approach : each three-dimensional voxel of the micromagnetic simulation is\nprojected onto a plane. If the projected voxel is misaligned with the new mesh of the\nmagnetic distribution, its value is spread on the four nearest neighbours depending on its\ncenter of mass in this square. The phase shift is associated with a simple object plane\nwithout a thickness. Note that the defocus used experimentally and in simulation is very\nimportant (close to mm) regarding the thickness of the dot (100 nm). The assumption of a\nsimple phase object with no thickness should thus be valid.\nFig. 7-(a) and (b) present the three-dimensional modelling. Simulated Fresnel contrast\nobtained from simulation with various transverse applied fields (Fig. 7-(b-c)) yield a similar\nperturbation that on experimental Fresnel fringes (Fig. 7-(d)). We are therefore confident\nthat such a perturbation in the fringe pattern is clearly related to the presence of a surface\n11\n\n\fvortex.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have described the micromagnetic configuration of epitaxially grown (110) iron dots.\nThe micromagnetic knowledge of these dots has been retrieved by Lorentz microscopy observations. These observations enabled to measure the domain wall width of an asymmetric\nBloch wall, and to compare it with micromagnetic simulations. Successful comparisons allowed to define more clearly how such asymmetric wall may be defined and what magnetic\nwidth measured by LTEM refers to. Two of the three degrees of freedom in such structures\nwhere also derived. Besides, various magnetic configurations were highlighted during phase\nretrieval processes. All these configurations could be easily obtained by modifying the magnetic history of the dots. Finally, the switching process of the N\u00e9el Caps surrounding the\ncentral Bloch wall was perfectly described with the used of interference patterns created in\nFresnel contrast, underlining the potential of high-coherence microscopes in getting the highest resolution information using Lorentz microscopy. With such a detection in our LTEM\nmeasurement we could estimate the spatial resolution of LTEM to 10 nm corresponding to\nthe vortex diameter probed.\n\n[1]\n[2] 08, 1.\n[3] D. A. Allwood, G.
