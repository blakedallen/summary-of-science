Under these assumptions the electroweak breaking scale gets\nrelated to mS by a loop factor. Applied to specific models of supersymmetry breaking,\nthis mechanism naturally gives sparticles slightly above all present accelerator bounds.\non the same actual values of superparticle masses.\nThe problem in existing models is the occurrence of\nat least one of the following two instances. Without\nfine-tuning, either the underlying physics sets, at lowest order, the Higgs mass parameters at values similar\nto mS , the typical supersymmetric mass, or the radiative corrections to the Higgs masses involve large logarithms and make them again comparable to mS (or\nmore precisely to the gluino mass). Hence an expectation for mS in the same range of MZ , taking into account\nthe gauge nature of the quartic couplings of the MSSM\nHiggs fields. In our view, to find a model which avoids\nboth these correlations between the Higgs mass parameters and mS in a natural way is a phenomenologically\nrelevant and theoretically well defined problem. In such\na model MZ2 would be related to m2S by a loop factor\nwithout large logarithms, thus relaxing the naturalness\nupper bounds on sparticle masses.\nWe do not know of a straight solution for this problem. We can, however, present a hypothesis which, if\nit were satisfied in a given model, would precisely solve\nit. As we shall see, the implications for some of the\nsuperpartner masses would also be rather precise.\n\n1 The search for supersymmetry has not been successful so far. No superpartner has been found yet. At the\nsame time, the lower limit on the mass of the Higgs field,\nmh , is steadily growing and already covers a large portion of the range expected for the mass of the lightest\nHiggs scalar in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM).\nIn some way, this is in contrast with the spectacular\nsuccess of the correlation foreseen in a unified supersymmetric theory between the strong coupling constant \u03b13\nand the weak mixing angle [1]. Similarly, the significant\ndirect lower limit on the Higgs mass must be contrasted\nwith the range for the same mass indirectly indicated\nby the electroweak precision tests [2], centered on the\nexpectation in a supersymmetric extension of the SM.\nWe have to be more precise here. As well known, the\nsuccessful prediction for \u03b13 (MZ ) in a unified supersymmetric theory in no way requires superpartners so light\nthat they had to be already discovered. On the contrary,\nif one could neglect uncertainties in this prediction associated for example with the threshold effects at unification or with the nearby scale of gravity, the central\nvalue of the prediction, \u03b13 (MZ ) = 0.128(10) [3], slightly\nhigher than the observed value, \u03b13 (MZ )MS = 0.119(3),\nmight even indicate superpartners heavier than those\naccessible to present day searches.\nThe problem, rather, is of theoretical nature and\nis related to the fine-tuning argument. In existing supersymmetric models, all superpartner masses can be\npushed above the present experimental limits only at\nthe price of some level of apparently accidental tuning\namong different parameters [4]. While such tuning for\nsure cannot be excluded, it would be better to have an\nexplanation for it. Such an explanation would be particularly welcome if, at the same time, it shed some light\n\n2 We assume that a theory exists where the scale of the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking masses is not fixed at the\nclassical level but is rather determined by the quantum\ncorrections associated with the light MSSM fields [5].\nFurthermore we assume that the cosmological term in\nthe effective potential, to be precisely defined in a while,\ndoes not influence in a significant way such determination.\nA specific implementation of this hypothesis could\nbe as follows. All soft supersymmetry breaking masses\nare proportional to a unique dynamical field mS , which\n1\n\n\fparameterizes a flat direction of the potential at the\nclassical level. This mS field must be viewed as an extra dynamical variable in addition to the usual MSSM\nHiggs fields hu and hd [5]. Furthermore in the effective potential Veff (hu , hd , mS ), the \"cosmological term\"\nVeff (0, 0, mS ) is either identically vanishing or is small\nenough not to influence the determination of mS .\nIn general Veff (0, 0, mS ), which receives contributions\nfrom all particles coupled to mS , is expected to contain\nboth a quadratic and a logarithmic term in the cut-off.\nAt one loop these terms are respectively proportional\nto STr M 2 and STr M 4 , where M is the general, mS dependent mass matrix in the theory. We can offer no\nexplanation of why these terms, or those occurring in\nhigher order, should cancel out to a sufficient degree not\nto play any significant role in the determination of mS ,\nbut this is what we assume. This might perhaps have\nsomething to do with the problem of the cosmological\nconstant.\nThe point of this paper is that, if this hypothesis can\nbe met, not only mS is fixed at an exponentially small\nvalue with respect to the cut-off but also the problem\nformulated in the previous section is neatly solved.\nIn words, the idea can be simply explained as follows. By the usual Coleman-Weinberg mechanism the\nrelevant Higgs squared mass, which is born positive at\nthe cut-off \u039b, is led to zero in the infrared at a scale Q\nexponentially far from \u039b [6]. If mS were fixed, Q would\nhave to be bigger than mS but would otherwise be unrelated to it. On the contrary, if mS is a dynamical field,\nthe minimization of the potential wants mS to get close\nto Q. This is precisely what one is looking for. In this\nway MZ gets related to mS by a loop factor without\nlarge logarithms.\n\nwhere the dot stands for d/d ln \u03bc\u0304 and \u03bc\u0304 is the running\nscale. An explicit calculation gives\n\u0003\n2 \u0002 2 2\n\u03bc\u0307u sin \u03b2 + \u03bc\u03072d cos2 \u03b2 \u2212 2\u03bc\u03072ud sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2\ncos 2\u03b2\n(5)\nso that, using (2) and MZ2 = \u1e21 2 v 2 /2, we get\n\u03bc\u03072eff = \u2212\n\nMZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 = \u03bc\u03072u sin2 \u03b2 + \u03bc\u03072d cos2 \u03b2 \u2212 2\u03bc\u03072ud sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2.\n(6)\nUpon replacement of the \u03bc\u03072i with their explicit expressions, this is a relation between MZ2 and the soft supersymmetry breaking masses involving a loop factor as\npromised. This relation supplements the standard formula\nMZ2\n\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 \u03b2\n(7)\n= d 2u\n2\ntan \u03b2 \u2212 1\n\nand implies an apparent fine tuning of order (4\u03c0)2 in it.\nEq. (6) is a lowest order formula. A dominant correction to it occurs via the effects of the top/stop exchanges on the quartic Higgs couplings, as in the case\nof the Higgs masses [7]. As well known, for mS \u226b MZ ,\nonly one Higgs field h remains light from (1), approximately given by h = hd cos \u03b2 + hu sin \u03b2. The potential\nin this only field h is V (h) = m2 h2 + \u03bbh4 , where\nm2 = \u03bc2u sin2 \u03b2 + \u03bc2d cos2 \u03b2 \u2212 2\u03bc2ud sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2\nand\n\u03bb=\n\nwhich also includes the top/stop effects. Minimizing\nV (h), as before, with respect to h and to mS leads to the\nsame equation (6) with the replacement MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 \u2192\nm2h , where mh coincides with the lightest Higgs mass in\nthe approximation that we are considering.\n\n3 The analytic implementation of this idea is as follows. The MSSM Higgs potential for the neutral Higgs\nfields is\nV = \u03bc2u h2u + \u03bc2d h2d \u2212 2\u03bc2ud hu hd +\n\n\u1e21 2 2\n(h \u2212 h2d )2\n8 u\n\n4 Let us now discuss the consequences of our assumptions. For simplicity we will present them in the limit of\nmoderately large tan \u03b2 \u223c (5 \u00f7 10), so that (6) simplifies\nto\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u1e21 2 = gY2 + g22 and the \u03bc2i must be viewed as proportional to m2S , like all other mass parameters in the\nLagrangian. A further logarithmic dependence on mS\nof the \u03bc2i is induced by the usual running.\nMinimizing V with respect to the Higgs fields gives\nVmin = \u2212\u03bc4eff /2\u1e21 2 where\nsin 2\u03b2 =\n\n2\u03bc2ud\n,\n\u03bc2u + \u03bc2d\n\nand\n\u03bc2eff = \u03bc2u \u2212 \u03bc2d +\n\n\u1e21 2 v 2 cos 2\u03b2 = 2\u03bc2eff\nq\n(\u03bc2u + \u03bc2d )2 \u2212 4\u03bc4ud .\n\nMZ2 =\n\n\u03bc2\n\u2202Vmin\n= \u2212 eff2 (4\u03bc2eff + 2\u03bc\u03072eff ),\n\u2202mS\n2\u1e21\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 2 2\n6\u03bbt (\u03bcu + 2m2t\u0303 ) \u2212 4chi gi2 (Mi2 + \u03bc2 )\n2\n(4\u03c0)\n\nwhere 2m2t\u0303 \u2261 m2Q\u0303 + m2t\u0303R + A2t is a combination of stop\n3\n\nmass parameters, {ch1 , ch2 , ch3 } = {3/10, 3/2, 0}, and we\nhave used standard notations for the various parameters. The standard minimization, eq. (7), tells that\n\u03bc2u = \u2212MZ2 /2 is negligible. If also the terms proportional to the electroweak gauge\ncouplings can be ne\u221a\nglected, then mt\u0303 \u2248 4\u03c0MZ / 12. Knowing the value of\nthe stop scale, we can estimate that top/stop loop effects increase by \u223c (20 \u00f7 30)% the Higgs mass above\nthe tree level MSSM prediction (mh = MZ in the large\ntan \u03b2 and heavy sparticle limits). For tan \u03b2 > 5, mh\nranges from 110 to 120 GeV. As said, these loop corrections also increase by the same amount the prediction\nfor mt\u0303 , so that mt\u0303 \u223c (380 \u00f7 430) GeV.\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHaving assumed that no other mS dependent term contributes significantly to V , the \"sliding scale\" mS is determined by the minimization of Vmin . Neglecting the\nrunning of \u1e21, which becomes formally a two loop effect,\nwe obtain\nmS\n\n\u1e21 2\nmSUSY\n6\n\u03bb4 ln\ncos2 2\u03b2 +\n8\n(4\u03c0)2 t\nh\n\n(4)\n2\n\n\fphysics that generates the \u03bc term does not give at the\nsame time additional contributions to the Higgs and\nstop masses. In this case the sparticle spectrum is determined as function of tan \u03b2, of the effective number of\nmessengers n and of the mediation scale M . For moderately large tan \u03b2 the right-handed sleptons are heavier\n10\nthan 100 GeV when M >\n\u223c 10 GeV. In this region the\ngluino mass depends mainly on n and ranges between\n350 and 430 GeV.\nFinally, a general consequence of our assumptions is\nthe presence in mS of at least one scalar field. Depending\non its unknown kinetic term, it could either be a light\nscalar with small couplings, constrained by 'fifth force'\nexperiments, or, in the opposite limit, it could manifest\nitself as a state with a weak scale mass, that contributes\nto the invisible width of the Higgs and sligthly mixes\nwith it.\n\n140\n120\n\nhiggs mass\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\nAcknowledgments Work supported in part by the\nE.C. under TMR contract No. ERBFMRX\u2013CT96\u20130090.\nWe thank Riccardo Rattazzi for useful discussions.\n\nchargino mass\n\nFigure 1: Correlation between the chargino and the\nHiggs mass in minimal supergravity.

Such cancellations\ndo not happen in some popular models.\nIn minimal supergravity [8] (i.e. with universal soft\nterms at the unification scale) the RGE effects that induce EW symmetry breaking below the scale Q are dominated by the strong sector. In fact Q is most naturally\nof order of the scale at which the strong coupling begins to be 'strong' and the gluino begins to be 'heavy'.\nFor wide ranges of boundary conditions at the unification scale, terms proportional to the squared gluino\nmass end up dominating the r.h.s. of (6), that therefore becomes mainly a prediction for the gluino mass:\nM3 (M3 ) \u2248 450 GeV| cos 2\u03b2|. For moderately large tan \u03b2\nthis implies a chargino mass m\u03c7 \u2248 125 GeV. A sampling\nof the parameter space (see fig. 1) shows that in about\nhalf of this space (and almost always when tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 4) the\nself-tuning mechanism naturally gives sparticles above\nall accelerator exclusion bounds, but not far from them.\nSparticle loop effects often produce too large corrections\nto BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3); a significant part of the remaining\nportion of the parameter space should be probed by the\nplanned measurement of anomalous magnetic moment\nof the muon. The thermal relic abundance of neutralinos [9] can be in the cosmologically interesting range.\nIn more predictive models eq. (6) allows to fix the\nsparticle spectrum. This happens for example in gauge\nmediation models [10] if we assume that the unknown\n\n[3] P. Langacker, N. Polonsky, Phys. Rev. D52 (1995) 3081\n(hep-ph/9503214).\n[4] R. Barbieri, G.F.
