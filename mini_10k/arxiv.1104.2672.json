Introduction\nThe possible presence of a spatially modulated state in superconductors in a high\nmagnetic field was predicted by Fulde and Ferrell [1], and by Larkin and Ovchinnikov [2]\nmore than 40 years ago. While the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory assume\nCooper pairs with vanishing total momentum, the FFLO superconducting state\nrepresents a condensate of Cooper pairs with a finite total momentum. Since the\nFFLO state has an internal degree of freedom arising from the reflection or inversion\nsymmetry, a spontaneous breaking of the spatial symmetry occurs. Although this novel\nsuperconducting state with an exotic symmetry has been attracting much interest, the\nFFLO state has not been observed in superconductors for nearly 40 years. Under\nthese circumstances, the discovery of a new superconducting phase in CeCoIn5 at high\nmagnetic fields and low temperatures [3, 4] triggered many theoretical and experimental\nstudies because this high-field superconducting (HFSC) phase is a likely candidate for\nthe FFLO state [5]. The recent interest on the FFLO superconductivity/superfluidity\n\n\f2\nextends further into various related fields, such as organic superconductors [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\ncold atom gases [11, 12], astrophysics, and nuclear physics [13].\nThe HFSC phase of CeCoIn5 has been interpreted widely within the concept of\nthe FFLO state [5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. However, recent observations\nof the magnetic order in the HFSC phase call for a reexamination of this conclusion\n[24, 25]. It is not unlikely that this order will be closely connected with a AFM quantum\ncritical point observed in CeCoIn5 [26, 27]. Moreover, the nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) [24, 28, 29] and neutron scattering [25, 30] measurements may have uncovered\na novel superconducting state in this strongly correlated electron system.\nNeutron scattering measurements have found that the wave vector of the AFM\n~ + ~qinc with Q\n~ = (\u03c0, \u03c0) and the AFM staggered\norder is incommensurate ~qAF = Q\n~ AF is oriented along the c-axis [25]. Recent experiments have shown that\nmoment M\nthe incommensurability ~qinc is fixed along [1,-1,0] irrespective whether magnetic field is\ndirected along [1,1,0] and [1,0,0] in the tetragonal lattice [30]. These magnetic structures\nare consistent with the NMR measurements [31].\nSome theoretical scenarios have been proposed to explain the AFM order in the\nHFSC phase of CeCoIn5 . We have analyzed the possibility that AFM order arises from\nthe inhomogeneous Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state [32, 33]. The AFM order triggered\nby the emergence of \u03c0-triplet pairing or pair density wave (PDW) has been investigated\nin the BCS state [34, 35, 36] and in the homogeneous Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state [37]. In\norder to identify the HFSC phase of CeCoIn5 it is highly desirable to examine these\npossible phases by comparing their properties with the experimental results. In this\nstudy, we investigate the magnetic structure of AFM-FFLO state, in which the AFM\norder appears in the inhomogeneous LO state, and discuss the recent neutron scattering\nmeasurements.\n2. Formulation\nOur theoretical analysis is based on the microscopic model,\nX\n\nH = \u2212t\n\nc~\u2020i ,\u03c3 c~j ,\u03c3 + t0\n\nh~i ,~j i,\u03c3\n\n+U\n\nX\n~i\n\nn~i \u2191 n~i \u2193 + V\n\nX\n\nc~\u2020i ,\u03c3 c~j ,\u03c3 + t00\n\nhh~i ,~j ii,\u03c3\n\nX\nh~i ,~j i\n\nn~i n~j + J\n\nX\n\nc~\u2020i ,\u03c3 c~j ,\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc\n\nh~i ,~j i\n\n~~ S\n~\n~\nS\ni ~j \u2212 gB H\n\nc~i ,\u03c3 c~i ,\u03c3\n\n~i ,\u03c3\n\nhhh~i ,~j iii,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nX \u2020\n\nX\n\n~~ ,\nS\ni\n\n(1)\n\n~i\n\n~~ is the spin operator and n~ is the number operator at site ~i = (m, n). To\nwhere S\ni\ni\ndescribe the quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure of CeCoIn5 , we assume a square\nlattice, in which the bracket h~i , ~j i, hh~i , ~j ii, and hhh~i , ~j iii denote the summation over\nthe nearest-neighbor sites, next-nearest-neighbor sites, and third nearest neighbor sites,\nrespectively.\nThe on-site repulsive interaction is given by U , and V and J stand for the\nattractive and AFM exchange interactions, respectively, between nearest-neighbor sites.\nWe introduce V to stabilize the d-wave superconducting state within the mean field\n\n\f3\nBdG equations and choose J > 0 favoring AFM correlation in CeCoIn5 . The effective\ninteraction leading to the d-wave superconductivity near the AFM instability arises from\nthe simple Hubbard model or periodical Anderson model beyond the mean field theory\n[38, 39], but we here assume the interactions V and J to describe these features in the\ninhomogeneous LO phase on the basis of mean field BdG equations. Although the BdG\nequations neglect the AFM spin fluctuation beyond the mean field approximation, they\nare suitable for studying the qualitative features of the inhomogeneous superconducting\nand/or magnetic state. The roles of AFM spin fluctuation has been discussed in Ref. [33].\nWith the last term in eq. (1), we include the Zeeman coupling due to the applied\nmagnetic field. The g-factor is assumed to be gB = 2. The magnetic field lies in the\nab-plane of the tetragonal lattice and the superconducting vortices are neglected for\nsimplicity. We choose the unit of energy such that t = 1 and t0 /t = 0.25, t00 /t = 0.05.\nThe chemical potential enters as \u03bc = \u03bc0 + ( 21 U + 4V )n0 , where n0 is the number density\nfor U = V = J = H = 0. We vary the bare chemical potential from \u03bc0 = \u22121.25 to\n\u03bc0 = \u22121.15 to investigate the possible magnetic structures in the AFM-FFLO state.\nThen, we obtain the number density n = 0.72 \u223c 0.82.\nWe study the magnetic structure in the AFM-FFLO state in the following way.\nFirst, the BdG equations are self-consistently solved for the mean fields of the spin\n0\n= hc~i \u03c3 c~j \u03c30 i, where S~hi is the spin operator\nhS~hi i, charge hn~i i, and superconductivity \u2206~\u03c3\u03c3\ni ,~j\nparallel to the magnetic field. We take into account the Hartree term arising from U , V ,\nand J. Since the spin singlet d-wave state is stable in this model, the superconducting\norder parameter is described as\n\u2206d (~i ) = \u2206~\u2191\u2193\n+ \u2206~\u2191\u2193\n\u2212 \u2206~\u2191\u2193\n\u2212 \u2206~\u2191\u2193\n,\ni ,~i +~a\ni ,~i \u2212~a\ni ,~i +~b\ni ,~i \u2212~b\n\n(2)\n\nwith ~a and ~b being the unit vector along the a- and b-axes, respectively. As for the\nspatial dependence of \u2206d (~i ), we find that the inhomogeneous LO state is stable against\nthe uniform FF state. Then, the order parameter is real and oscillates in the space.\nWe assume the single-q spatial modulation along the magnetic field in which the order\n~\nparameter is approximately described as \u2206d (~i ) \u223c \u2206 cos(i~qFFLO * ~i ) with ~qFFLO k H\nexcept for the vicinity of the BCS-FFLO transition. This is the most stable FFLO state\nin the presence of superconducting vortices when the Fermi surface is nearly isotropic.\nWe determine the stable superconducting state by comparing the condensation energy of\nBCS, FFLO and normal states. The orientation of magnetic field is taken into account\n~ will be\nin the direction of ~qFFLO in our formulation. The case of ~qFFLO not parallel to H\ndiscussed at the last of this paper.\nSecond, we determine the magnetic instability by calculating the transverse spin\nsusceptibility using the random phase approximation,\n~ ~\n\u03c7\u00b1\n0 (i , j )\n\u03c7\u00b1 (~i , ~j ) =\n(3)\nP\n~ ~\n1 \u2212 ~ I(~i , ~k)\u03c7\u00b1\n0 (k, j )\nk\n\nwhere I(~i , ~i ) = U , I(~i , ~i \u00b1 ~a) = I(~i , ~i \u00b1 ~b) = \u2212 J2 , and otherwise I(~i , ~k) = 0. The bare\n~ ~\nspin susceptibility \u03c7\u00b1\n0 (k, j ) is calculated for the mean field Hamiltonian obtained by\n\n\f4\nsolving the BdG equations. The magnetic instability is determined by the divergence\nof transverse spin susceptibility assuming a second order magnetic phase transition.\nThen, the criterion is \u03bbmax = 1 where \u03bbmax is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix\nP\n~ ~\nK(~i , ~j ) = ~k I(~i , ~k)\u03c7\u00b1\n0 (k, j ). The magnetic moment perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield is obtained as\nM (~i ) = I \u22121 (~i , ~k)m(~k),\n\n(4)\n\nnear the critical point, where m(~k) is the eigenvector of K(~i , ~j ) for the eigenvalue \u03bbmax\nP\nand ~k I \u22121 (~i , ~k)I(~k, ~j ) = \u03b4~i ,~j . We denote the AFM staggered moment MAF (~i ) =\n(\u22121)m+n M (~i ) with ~i = (m, n).\nSince the effect of induced PDW order, which plays an important role to stabilize\nthe AFM-FFLO state, is ignored in this formulation, the stability of the AFM order\nis underestimated. However, we confirmed that the induced PDW does not affect the\nmagnetic structure [33]. Choosing the parameters U , V , and J so that \u03bbmax = 1 in\nthe FFLO state as in Refs. [32, 33], we discuss the variety of magnetic structures in\nthe AFM-FFLO state in the following sections. In our model the incommensurate wave\nvector ~qinc is along ~a or ~b direction and different from the experimental observation\n~qinc k [1, \u00b11, 0] [25]. However, the relationship between the magnetic structure and\n~ is appropriately captured in our calculation.\nrelative angle of ~qinc and ~qFFLO (and H)\n3. Magnetic structure\nWe here show that the magnetic structure in the AFM-FFLO state is classified into three\ncases. (I) In the strongly localized case, the AFM moment is confined into the FFLO\nnodal planes where the superconducting order parameter vanishes. The magnitude\nof AFM moment away from the nodal planes is typically \u223c 0.01 of that around the\nnodal planes. (II) In the weakly localized case, the AFM moment appears in the whole\nspatial region, and its magnitude is enhanced around the FFLO nodal planes, typically\ntwice. (III) In the extended case, the AFM moment is nearly homogeneous and slightly\nsuppressed in the vicinity of FFLO nodal planes.\nOwing to the four fold rotation symmetry of the tetragonal lattice the\na\nb\nincommensurate wave vector ~qinc = ~qinc\nk ~a is degenerate with ~qinc = ~qinc\nk ~b in the\nnormal state and uniform BCS state. This degeneracy is lifted in the FFLO state except\na\nb\nfor ~qFFLO k ~qinc\n+ ~qinc\n. Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) show typical magnetic structures\n~ k ~q a . We see that\nof cases (I), (II), and (III), respectively for the magnetic field H\ninc\nthe modulation vector of AFM moment is different between the case (III) and the\nother two cases. In the extended case the incommensurate wave vector ~qinc is parallel\nto the FFLO modulation vector ~qFFLO . Thus, the extended case (III) is incompatible\n~ k ~qFFLO .

These satellite peaks\narise from the broken translational symmetry in the FFLO state, and their amplitude\nreflects the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic structure. Therefore, the satellite peaks\nare pronounced in (I) the strongly localized case, while those are obscure in the cases\n(II) and (III).\nWe here discuss the possible magnetic structure of CeCoIn5 in the HFSC phase\non the basis of Figs. 3 and 4. The strongly localized case (I) is incompatible with\ntwo features of neutron scattering experiments. First, the satellite peaks are absent\nor have a very weak intensity [25, 30]. Second, the position of main Bragg peaks is\nindependent of the orientation of magnetic field in the ab-plane [30]. The extended\ncase (III) is incompatible with the neutron scattering measurement for magnetic fields\nalong [1, \u00b11, 0] for which the incommensurate wave vector ~qinc is perpendicular to the\n~ [25]. On the other hand, the weakly localized case (II) shown in Figs. 3(b) and\nfield H\n4(b) is consistent with the neutron scattering experiments in which the incommensurate\n~ for H\n~ k [1, \u00b11, 0], and the\nwave vector is perpendicular to the field direction ~qinc \u22a5 H\nposition of main Bragg peaks does not change by rotating the magnetic field in the\nab-plane. The four main Bragg peaks appear in Fig. 4(b) in contrast to Fig. 3(b) owing\nto the symmetry of system. This change has been observed in the neutron scattering\nmeasurement too [30].

This AFM-FFLO state can be realized in CeCoIn5 for the magnetic\nfield along [1, 0, 0] or [0, 1, 0] direction [30]. We assume the same parameters as in Fig. 3.\n\npossible AFM-FFLO state in CeCoIn5 should be (II) the weakly localized case. This is\nthe main conclusion of this paper.\n\n\f8\n5. Discussion\nWe studied the magnetic structure of AFM order in the FFLO superconducting state.\nWe find that the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic moment is reduced by increasing the\nincommensurability |~qinc | and enhancing the nesting of Fermi surface. This change of the\nmagnetic structure is realized in our model by decreasing the number density from the\nhalf filling. Comparing our results with the neutron scattering experiments in CeCoIn5 ,\nthe unconventional magnetic order in the HFSC phase of CeCoIn5 is consistent with the\nAFM-FFLO state proposed by us when the AFM staggered moment is weakly localized\naround the FFLO nodal planes. This is the \"weakly localized case\" in our classification\nof the magnetic structure.\nFinally, we discuss two points. (1) In our discussion we assumed that the FFLO\nmodulation vector ~qFFLO lies parallel to the magnetic field, since this is the most stable\nFFLO state, unless the anisotropy of Fermi surface favors another ~qFFLO . On the\nother hand, if ~qFFLO is fixed by the anisotropic electronic structure, the position of the\nBragg peaks measured by neutron scattering would be independent of the magnetic\nfield orientation, consistent with the experimental observation. This would apply\nto the AFM-FFLO state in the \"weakly localized case\" as well as in the \"strongly\nlocalized case\" and the \"extended case\". This implies, however, that BCS-to-AFMFFLO transition would be of first order [21, 22, 23]. While this is in contrast to the\nexperimental observation, we can not exclude a weakly first order transition which is\nexperimentally hard to detect.\na\nb\ncorresponds\n(2) The magnetic structure for the magnetic field along ~qinc\n+ ~qinc\n~\nto H k [1, 0, 0] in CeCoIn5 . For this field direction Fig. 2 shows a double-q Bragg\nb\na\n* ~i ) which is\n* ~i ) \u00b1 cos(~qinc\npeak structure of the magnetization MAF (~i ) \u223c cos(~qinc\ndifferent from the single-q structure seen in Fig. 1. We distinguish two situations\na\nb\na\nb\n~ k ~qinc\nfor the evolution of MAF (~i ) = \u03b7a cos(~qinc\n* ~i ) + \u03b7b cos(~qinc\n* ~i ) for H\n+ ~qinc\n.\nb\na\nIn the \"commensurate case\" where ~qinc + ~qinc = 2N~qFFLO , N being an integer, the\ndouble-q structure (|\u03b7a | = |\u03b7b |) remains stable for a small temperature range below TN\na\nand then changes continuously towards a single-q structure, MAF (~i ) \u223c cos(~qinc\n* ~i ) or\nb ~\nMAF (~i ) \u223c cos(~qinc\n* i ), by shifting the weight between the two components, |\u03b7a | =\n6 |\u03b7b |.\nNote that this corresponds to a symmetry breaking transition of Z2 character. On the\na\nb\nother hand, for the \"incommensurate case\" ~qinc\n+ ~qinc\n6= 2N~qFFLO , we find \u03b7a = 0 or\n\u03b7b = 0 (single-q structure) for any T \u2264 TN . Since ~qFFLO depends on the magnetic\nfield, we expect to see a sequence of commensurate points following the phase boundary\nTN (H) in the H-T phase diagram. This leads to a intriguing phase diagram near\nthe commensurate points, which will be shown in another publication [40]. In most\nof the regime inside the AFM-FFLO phase the single-q state is stable for magnetic\n~ k [1, 0, 0]. If this assumption holds true then the observed four Bragg peaks\nfields H\nin neutron scattering should be interpreted as arising from domain formation of the\ntwo degenerate single-q states, i.e. |\u03b7a | > |\u03b7b | and |\u03b7a | < |\u03b7b |. Note that the NMR\nspectrum in the HFSC phase of CeCoIn5 [31] is consistent with a single-q structure, but\n\n\f9\nnot with the double-q structure. The detailed analysis of the NMR experiments under\nthe assumption of weakly localized form of the AFM-FFLO state, as proposed in this\npaper, will be reported elsewhere.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to D.F.
