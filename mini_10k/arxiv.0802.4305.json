Anosov flows are very chaotic being not only mixing, but\neven Bernoullian [2]. For instance, the Poincar\u00e9 section shows the absence of KAM tori [3].\nFor a review, see [4].\nOn the other hand integrability or not of a given mechanical system remains as an non\nanswered question, albeit much progress had occurred recently [5]. Since Krylov's work [6]\nmany researchers have transformed the mechanical problem of the motion of a particle in\na given potential into a billiard problem [7]. This is achieved by writing the Jacobi metric\nassociated to the given potential. In this approach, the motion is geodesic. The Jacobi\nmanifold is specifically obtained to incorporate the effects of the fields.\nIn this context the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian provides an example of an everywhere\npositive curvature space which is well known to be chaotic [8]. More generally, chaos is\nrelated to the parametric instability induced by variations of the scalar curvature along the\ngeodesic [9]. Also, the infinite hyperbolic space, is very well known to be integrable and an\neverywhere negative (constant) curvature space. There is not any rigorous relation between\ninstability of the geodesic and the curvature of the manifold.\nIn the cosmological context it is the geometry itself the more fundamental field. The\ngeodesic motion of particles, follow directly from the covariant divergence of the energy\nmomentum tensor [10]. A few years ago Cornish et al suggested that the chaotic motion of\nparticles in a closed negatively curved manifold as a possible mechanism responsible for the\nhomogenization of the Universe [11].\nAnyway for spatialy multiply connected manifolds, the point x and the point \u03b3x where\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, x \u2261 \u03b3x for all the elements of the fundamental group \u0393. That is, the point x and \u03b3x\nare the same and identical point. This means that any function on this manifold must be\nperiodic in some sense. Mathematically, the functions defined on a closed manifold M are\ncalled automorfic, see for example [12], [4].\nOne way of obtaining this periodicity is by imposing summations over the spectrum of the\nLaplace operator of the particular manifold in question. It is well known that summations\nover the spectrum are equivalent to summation over the closed geodesics, also known as the\nmethod of images, [4], [12]. This result lies at the hart of the Selberg formalism for the\n\n\f3\ncalculations of functional traces and is valid at least for manifolds, Lie groups included [13].\nAlso, the geodesic structure is very important in connection with quantum chaos, see for\nexample [14], [4]. The duality spectrum-geodesic was used to obtain the Casimir energy in\nclosed Universes, by collaborators and myself for example [15].\nIn 1839 it was discovered by Jacobi itself, that the geodesic motion on an ellipsoid is integrable [16]. Jacobi used a particular coordinate system [17], now known as Jacobi elliptical\ncoordinates, and obtained an independent, and involutive constant of the motion. In 1994,\nKnieper and Weiss [18] proved that there are many smooth Riemannian metrics on S 2 with\nchaotic geodesic flows. The authors consider arbitrary small deviations of the metric on the\nellipsoid. Then, the Melnikov method is used to prove the existence of an homoclinic point.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a concrete example of two manifolds topologically\nequivalent to a sphere. The geodesics are investigated using the technique of the Poincar\u00e9\nsurface of section. Section III includes a very brief discussion of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem,\nfor more details see [19]. In section II the geodesic motion of the given manifold, shows that\nthe non integrable regions form a set with negligible or zero measure in phase space. In\nsection III the geodesic flow on the manifold, shows that the chaotic regions are enlarged.\nWe speculate that the presence of chaos is related to regions of positive and negative values\nof the scalar curvature for this particular example under consideration.\nAnyway, in Section III and in the conclusions it is stressed that a closed space with\ndomains of negative and positive curvature is not a mandatory condition for chaotic geodesic\nmotion.\n\nII.\n\nAN EVERYWHERE POSITIVE CURVATURE SPACE\n\nThis manifold is obtained as the immersion of a closed surface in the Euclidean space E 3 .\nAs is well known, the spherical harmonics Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) form a complete base for any function\ndefined on S 2 .

When a = 0, it corresponds to the usual S 2 . For small values of a, it provides\ndeformations of S 2 .

As we are considering geodesics, the value of\nthe energy H = E can be easily rescaled and absorbed into a new time scale. For instance\nthe energy can be set to one E = 1, then the parameter \u03bb is equivalent to the geodesic\ndistance s, \u03bb \u2261 s. Since the value of the energy can be trivially rescaled it was chosen at\nwill throughout this work. Of course the Poincar\u00e9 sections refer to fixed, constant energy\nsurfaces.\n\n\f6\nWe quote here the geodesic deviation equations\nb\nua \u2207a nb = Rklm\nuk ul nm ,\nb\nwhere Rklm\nis the Riemann tensor for the metric in (2).

Of course, both manifolds in this work,\nhave g = 0, as can be seen in FIG. 1 and FIG. 4. Anyway this second manifold has some\ndomains with negative curvature as can be seen by Riemann scalar curvature for the metric\ngiven in (2) plotted in FIG. 5.\nAccording to (4) in these domains, since K < 0, the geodesics diverge exponentially.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 section for the Hamiltonian (3) with a = 2, is shown in FIG. 6.

The intersection surface is\nset to \u03c6 = 5.0 and the constant Hamiltonian, shows a cumulative error in one part in \u223c 1011 .\n\nshown a periodic geodesic on the torus, with period 3 : 1. On the right side of FIG. 7 it is\nshown the surface of section with the plane y = 0, corresponding to the periodic orbit. There\nare only 3 points. This occurs because all the elements of the fundamental group, commute\nwith the linear momentum ~p = (\u1e8b, \u1e8f). For a non periodic orbit, i.e. a periodic orbit with\na period T \u2192 \u221e, the surface of section for the single orbit would be a \"continuous\" line.\nThis line corresponds to a surface in phase space, that is, a zero measure set in the constant\nenergy 3\u2212D phase space. This motion is not ergodic in the constant energy allowable phase\nspace.\nGeometrically a compact space of constant negative curvature is a torus with genus g > 1.\nIn this case, the Poisson bracket of the infinitesimal generators of the fundamental group\nwith the momenta are not zero {\u03bei , ~p} =\n6 0, i.e. they do not commute. This is what originates\nchaos in closed, smooth, constant negatively curved manifolds, for more details see [4].\n\n\f10\n\ny\n\nx\nE\n\n2\n\nb\na\n\na\n\nx\n\nx\n\nFIG. 7.

It is shown the Poincar\u00e9 section for the\nperiodic geodesic drawn on the right. The intersection surface is set to y = 0.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAnosov's famous result, states that the geodesic flow is chaotic in a compact manifold of\nconstant negative curvature [1]. Anosov flows are very chaotic being not only mixing, but\neven Bernoullian [2]. For instance, the Poincar\u00e9 section shows the absence of KAM tori [3].\nFor a review, see [4].\nIntegrability or not of a given mechanical system remains as an non answered question.\nSince Krylov's work [6] many researchers have transformed the mechanical problem of the\nmotion of a particle in a given potential into a billiard problem [7]. This is achieved by\nwriting the Jacobi metric associated to the given potential. In this approach, the motion is\ngeodesic. The Jacobi manifold is specifically obtained to incorporate the effects of the fields.\nThere has been an attempt to establish a local criteria for chaos. In particular A. Saa\n[7] shows an example of chaos occurring in a strictly positive curvature space, K > 0. J.\nSzcz\u0229sny and T. Dobrowolski in [7] show an example of an integrable system with K <\n0, namely the classical scattering Kepler problem. In the above mentioned examples the\nmanifolds are not closed. This result is in contrast to the geodesic motion on S 2 , K = 1\nwhich is integrable, and on the genus g = 2 torus, K = \u22121 which is strongly chaotic [1].\n\n\f11\nAs it is well known, there is not any trivial relation between integrability or not of the\ngeodesic flow to the sign of Gaussian curvature of the manifold.\nIn FIG. 6, there is some geodesic chaos. The manifold which contains the geodesics\nis given in FIG. 4 and it has regions with K < 0 and K > 0. According to equation\n(4), positive curvature approaches neighboring geodesics, and negative curvature diverge\nneighboring geodesics.\nMore generally, chaos is related to the parametric instability induced by variations of the\nscalar curvature along the geodesic [9]. In FIG. 3 the chaotic regions of the geodesic flow\nare small, and the curvature K > 0 is positive everywhere. We have specifically checked\nsmaller values of the parameter a (2) so that the curvature is everywhere positive but very\nsmall for particular values of \u03b8 and \u03c6, for example a = 1.2. For this value of a = 1.2, still\nthe chaotic regions are all very small. Apparently, only when there are negative values of K\nthe difference between their maximum and minimum values is enough to cause the desired\ninstability.\nIt is also well known that parametric instability can stabilize an unstable fixed point, see\nfor instance the reversed pendulum [17] . The Jacobi manifold in this case exhibits mixed\nsign curvature. So mixed signed curvature can either result in ordered motion, otherwise it\ncan result in chaotic motion.\nFor instance, the fundamental region of the genus g = 1 torus in FIG. 7 is a rectangle\nwith opposite sides identified. The geodesic flow in the torus is integrable. Of course the\nintegrability of the torus is due to the involutive integrals of the motion, and yet provides\nan example in which mixed sign curvature does not introduce instabilities.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nD.
