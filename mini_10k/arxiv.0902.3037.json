In this paper, it is proved that a commutative noetherian local\nring admitting a finitely generated module of finite projective and injective\ndimensions with respect to a semidualizing module is Gorenstein. This result\nrecovers a celebrated theorem of Foxby.\n\n1. Introduction\nA semidualizing module over a commutative noetherian ring is a common generalization of a free module of rank one and a dualizing module. Pioneering studies\nof semidualizing modules were done by Foxby [4], Golod [8] and Christensen [2].\nA semidualizing module not only gives rise to several homological dimensions of\nmodules, but also establishes an equivalence between categories of modules called\nAuslander and Bass categories. So far a lot of authors have studied semidualizing\nmodules from various points of view.\nLet R be a commutative noetherian ring, and let C be a semidualizing R-module.\nFor a nonzero R-module M , the C-projective dimension C-pdR M of M is defined\nto be the infimum of integers n such that there exists an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 C \u2297R Pn \u2192 * * * \u2192 C \u2297R P1 \u2192 C \u2297R P0 \u2192 M \u2192 0\nof R-modules where Pi is projective for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Dually, the C-injective dimension\nC-idR M of M is defined to be the infimum of integers n such that there exists an\nexact sequence\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 HomR (C, I 0 ) \u2192 HomR (C, I 1 ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 HomR (C, I n ) \u2192 0\nof R-modules where I i is injective for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. The C-projective and C-injective\ndimensions of the zero module are defined as \u2212\u221e.\nIn the 1970s, Foxby [5], verifying a conjecture of Vasconcelos [12], proved that\na commutative noetherian local ring is Gorenstein if it admits a nonzero finitely\ngenerated module of finite projective and injective dimensions. As a natural generalization of this statement, Takahashi and White [11] asked whether the same\nconclusion holds true even if \"projective\" and \"injective\" are replaced with \"Cprojective\" and \"C-injective\" respectively. Recently Sather-Wagstaff and Yassemi\n[10] answered that this question has an affirmative answer in the case where the\nC-projective dimension is equal to zero. The main purpose of this paper is to give\na complete answer to the question; we shall prove the following theorem.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13D05, 13C13, 13H10.\nKey words and phrases. projective dimension, injective dimension, semidualizing module,\nGorenstein ring.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTOKUJI ARAYA AND RYO TAKAHASHI\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let R be a commutative noetherian ring, and let C be a semidualizing R-module. Let M be a finitely generated R-module with C-pdR M < \u221e and\nC-idR M < \u221e. Then Rp is Gorenstein for every p \u2208 SuppR M .\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nWe denote by D(R) the derived category of R. To prove our theorem, we give a\nlemma.\nLemma 2.1. Let R be a commutative noetherian ring. Let X, Y, Z be R-complexes.\nAssume the following:\n(1) Hi (X) and Hi (Z) are finitely generated for all i \u2208 Z,\n(2) Hi (X) and Hi (Z) are zero for all i \u226a 0,\n(3) pdR Z < \u221e.\nThen there is a natural isomorphism\nRHomR (X, Y ) \u2297L Z \u223c\n= RHomR (X, Y \u2297L Z).\nR\n\nR\n\nin D(R).\nProof. There exist R-complexes\nP = (* * * \u2192 Pa+1 \u2192 Pa \u2192 0),\nQ = (0 \u2192 Qb \u2192 Qb\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Qc+1 \u2192 Qc \u2192 0)\nisomorphic (in D(R)) to X and Z respectively, such that Pi and Qj are finitely\ngenerated projective R-modules for i \u2265 a and b \u2265 j \u2265 c. We have RHomR (X, Y )\u2297L\nR\nZ = HomR (P, Y ) \u2297R Q and RHomR (X, Y \u2297L\nR Z) = HomR (P, Y \u2297R Q). There is a\nnatural homomorphism HomR (P, Y ) \u2297R Q \u2192 HomR (P, Y \u2297R Q) of R-complexes;\nsee [1, (A.2.10)]. This homomorphism is an isomorphism by [3, (2.7)].\n\u0003\nNow we can prove our main theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Replacing R with Rp , we may assume that R is local. We\ndenote by k the residue field of R. Note from [11, (2.9)\u2013(2.11)] that M is in\nboth the Auslander class AC (R) and the Bass class BC (R), and that HomR (C, M )\n(respectively, C \u2297R M ) is a nonzero finitely generated R-module of finite projective\n(respectively, injective) dimension. We have isomorphisms\nC \u2297R M \u223c\n= C \u2297L M\nR\n\nL\n\u223c\n= C \u2297L\nR (C \u2297R HomR (C, M ))\n\u223c\n= (C \u2297L C) \u2297L HomR (C, M )\nR\n\nR\n\nin D(R). Using Lemma 2.1, we get isomorphisms\n\u223c RHomR (k, (C \u2297L C) \u2297L HomR (C, M ))\nRHomR (k, C \u2297R M ) =\nR\nR\nL\nL\n\u223c\n= RHomR (k, C \u2297 C) \u2297 HomR (C, M ).\nR\n\nR\n\nBy [1, (A.7.9)], we obtain:\nL\nsup(RHomR (k, C \u2297L\nR C)) = sup(RHomR (k, C \u2297R M )) \u2212 sup(k \u2297R HomR (C, M ))\n\n= \u2212 depthR (C \u2297R M ) \u2212 pdR (HomR (C, M )) \u2208 Z,\ninf(RHomR (k, C\n\n\u2297L\nR\n\nC)) = inf(RHomR (k, C \u2297R M )) \u2212 inf(k \u2297L\nR HomR (C, M ))\n= \u2212 idR (C \u2297R M ) \u2208 Z.\n\n\fA GENERALIZATION OF A THEOREM OF FOXBY\n\n3\n\nL\nHence the R-complex RHomR (k, C \u2297L\nR C) is bounded, and so is C \u2297R C by [6, (2.5)].\nL\nL\nThus we get idR (C \u2297R C) = \u2212 inf(RHomR (k, C \u2297R C)) \u2208 Z by [1, (A.5.7.4)].\nIt follows from [2, (4.4) and (4.6)(a)] that there is a natural isomorphism C \u223c\n=\nL\nL\nRHomR (C, C \u2297L\nC),\nand\nso\nwe\nhave\nnatural\nisomorphisms\nRHom\n(C\n\u2297\nC,\nC\n\u2297\nR\nR\nR\nR\nL\nL\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\nC) = RHomR (C, RHomR (C, C \u2297R C)) = RHomR (C, C) = R. Therefore C \u2297R C\nis a (semi)dualizing R-complex. It follows from [7, (3.2)] that C is isomorphic to\nR. Thus the dualizing R-complex C \u2297L\nR C is isomorphic to R, which concludes that\nR is a Gorenstein ring.\n\u0003\n\n3. Foxby's theorem\nApplying Theorem 1.1 to the semidualizing R-module C = R for a local ring R,\nwe immediately recover a well-known result of Foxby.\nCorollary 3.1. [5, (4.4)] Let R be a commutative noetherian local ring. Let M be\na nonzero finitely generated R-module with pdR M < \u221e and idR M < \u221e. Then R\nis Gorenstein.\nRemark 3.2. (1) Holm [9] investigates existence of modules of finite Gorenstein\nprojective and injective dimensions, and shows a result which also recovers\nCorollary 3.1.\n(2) Our method in the proof of Theorem 1.1 actually gives a more simple proof\nof Corollary 3.1 than the proof due to Foxby. In fact, let R and M be as in\nCorollary 3.1. Then we have\nRHomR (k, M ) \u223c\n= RHomR (k, R \u2297L M ) \u223c\n= RHomR (k, R) \u2297L M,\nR\n\nR\n\nwhich gives\nidR R = \u2212 inf RHomR (k, R)\n= \u2212 inf RHomR (k, M ) + inf(k \u2297L\nR M ) = idR M < \u221e,\nnamely, R is Gorenstein.\n(3) Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with dualizing module \u03c9. Then, applying\nTheorem 1.1 to the semidualizing R-module C = \u03c9, we get the same result as\nCorollary 3.1, because for an R-module M one has \u03c9-pdR M < \u221e (respectively,\n\u03c9-idR M < \u221e) if and only if idR M < \u221e (respectively, pdR M < \u221e); see [11,\n(2.11)].\nAcknowledgments.
