Introduction\nThe discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in the perovskite manganites in 1993\nresulted in an extensive amount of research [1, 2], because of the potential for data\nstorage applications. Among the perovskite manganites, La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 (LSMO)\nhas the largest single electron bandwidth and the highest Curie temperature. These\nproperties, together with the 100% spin polarization, make LSMO an interesting\nmaterial for application in spintronic devices. Examples are magnetic tunnel junctions\n[3, 4, 5, 6], Schottky devices [7, 8, 9] and magnetoelectric devices [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nFurthermore, LSMO is also used to investigate other materials, e.g. by spin injection into\ncuprate superconductors [16, 17, 18, 19], to probe spin polarization at the BaTiO3 /Fe\ninterface [20] and to study spin dependent transport in organic materials [21].\nAll these applications require LSMO thin films and the device performance will\nmainly depend on the thin film quality. The optimization of the LSMO thin films\nis not straightforward, as different parameters exist which can be optimized, e.g.\nthe magnetization and the electrical conductivity. In addition to these parameters,\na smooth surface morphology is required for most applications. Focussing on ideal\nlayer-by-layer growth can compromise the functional properties of the film [22]. Other\ndetrimental effects are Mn3 O4 precipitates on LSMO surfaces, which are the result of\noff-stoichiometric deposition [23], and Sr segregation towards the surface [24].\nSummarizing, a high quality LSMO film combines an atomically smooth surface\nmorphology with a large magnetization and a low residual resistivity, while avoiding\nprecipitates and surface segregation. In literature, typically only a few of these issues\nare adressed, e.g., by focussing only on the electrical conductivity. Here, we show that\nhigh quality films, combining good ferromagnetic properties with a high conductivity\ncan be realized. As discussed in a previous paper [22], we optimized the LSMO\nfilms on a combination of the magnetic properties and two dimensional (2D) layerby-layer growth. We found that the properties of the films are very sensitive to the\namount of oxygen present during the deposition. Too little oxygen resulted in inferior\nferromagnetic properties, while too much oxygen resulted in three dimensional growth.\nIn this paper, we present a thorough characterization of the resulting films and compare\nthem to examples found in literature. The films have the highest reported saturation\nmagnetization. The optimization on ferromagnetism and 2D layer-by-layer growth\nresulted in a high conductivity and a lack of surface segregation as well.\nThis article is organized as follows. First, the growth of the films is described,\ntogether with an analysis of the surface morphology with reflection high energy\nelectron diffraction (RHEED) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Then the crystal\nstructure is discussed, followed by the functional properties, magnetization and electrical\nconductivity. In the next section, in situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)\nmeasurements are presented, which are used to study the possibility of surface\nsegregation. The interface atomic structure was measured with scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy (STEM). In the final section, the properties of the LSMO thin films\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n3\n\nare compared with films described in literature.\n2. Thin film growth\nIn this section, the growth of the LSMO thin films is described. First, the treatment\nof the substrates used as template for the growth is discussed. Then, the growth of\nthe thin films by pulsed laser deposition is described. In situ RHEED measurements\nare presented from which it is concluded that the initial growth occurs in the two\ndimensional layer-by-layer growth mode, and that a transition to a steady state growth\nmode occurs for thicker films. Finally, the surface morphology was characterized with\nscanning probe microscopy, which showed smooth surfaces without the presence of\nprecipitates.\n2.1. Substrates\nSeveral substrates are commercially available for the growth of oxide thin films. A\nnumber of substrates which have comparable lattice parameters to LSMO can be\nused as a template for the growth of the LSMO thin films. They include NdGaO3\n(NGO), (LaAlO3 )0,3 -(Sr2 AlTaO6 )0,7 (LSAT), SrTiO3 (STO) and DyScO3 (DSO). The\npseudocubic lattice parameters are respectively 3.85, 3.87, 3.905 and 3.95 \u00c5. STO and\nLSAT are cubic crystals while NGO and DSO have an orthorhombic crystal structure.\nFor the studies in this article, we used STO (001)c substrates, as STO is the standard\nsubstrate used for LSMO growth in literature and this allows for better comparison\nbetween the samples. (The subscripts o, c and pc denote the orthorhombic, cubic and\npseudocubic crystal structure, respectively.)\nThe substrates were first ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and ethanol. Singly\nTiO2 terminated (B-site) STO (001)c substrates were obtained with the procedure\ndeveloped by Koster et al. [25]. In some cases, the annealing step of 2 hours at 950\u25e6 C\nresulted in some Sr segregation from the bulk towards the surface, due to reduced STO\nquality [26, 27]. This could be observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), either in\nthe phase contrast or with the presence of straight stepedges aligned with the principal\ncrystal directions [28]. These substrates were treated with H2 O and the HF solution\nagain, followed by a 30 minute anneal at 920\u25e6 C, after which no SrO termination could\nbe detected.\n2.2. Pulsed laser deposition\nThe LSMO thin films were grown with pulsed laser deposition (PLD) (TSST system).\nThe substrate temperature during growth was 750-800 \u25e6 C in an oxygen environment of\n0.27 mbar. The laser beam was produced by a 248-nm-wavelength KrF excimer laser\n(LPXProTM from Coherent, Inc.) with a typical pulse duration of 20-30 ns. With a 4\nby 15 mm rectangular mask the most homogeneous part of the laser beam was selected.\nAn image of the mask was created on the stoichiometric target (Praxair electronics)\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n4\n\n30\n\n100\n80\n70\n\n80\n\n60\n\n25\n\n50\n40\n\n60\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n0\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\nFWHM\n\nIntensity\n\n20\n\n40\n\n10\n\n-20\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n5\n\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 1. RHEED specular spot intensity and FWHM as monitored during the initial\ngrowth of LSMO on STO (001)c . The inset shows an expanded view of the growth of\nthe first unit cell layer. Two RHEED images are presented, the left image was taken\nbefore deposition (at low pressure) and the right image was taken after deposition of\n5 unit cell layers.\n\nwith a lens, resulting in a spotsize of 2.3 mm2 (0.9 by 2.5 mm). The beam energy was\ncontrolled with a variable attenuator or with the laser voltage, yielding a fluence at the\ntarget of 2 J/cm2 . The repetition rate was 1 Hz and the substrate was placed at 5 cm\ndistance directly opposite to the target. Before deposition, the target was pre-ablated\nfor 2 minutes at 5 Hz to remove any possible surface contamination. After deposition,\nthe PLD chamber was flooded with pure oxygen (typically 100 mbar) and the samples\nwere cooled down by switching of the heater power. Typically, the cooldown required 2\nhours.\n2.3. Growth mode\nThe growth of the films was studied in situ with RHEED during the growth. The\nsubstrate RHEED pattern is shown in figure 1 on the top left. The main specular spot\nis very intense compared to the two side spots. This is the typical signature of TiO2\nterminated STO [28]. Kikuchi lines are visible as well, indicating the smoothness of\nthe substrate. The side spots are doubled, which is due to the additional periodicity\nat the surface from the regularly spaced terrace steps. Figure 1, top right, shows the\nRHEED image of the LSMO film after the deposition of 5 unit cell layers. Clear two\ndimensional spots are visible, but also 2D streaks are present. The latter are attributed\nto the scattering of the RHEED beam off the unit cell high steps at the surface. Similar\nRHEED images were observed after the completion of films with thicknesses up to 40\nnm.\nThe main graph in figure 1 shows the intensity of the specular reflection as measured\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n5\n\n10\n100\n\n80\n\n9\n\n8\n40\n\n20\n\n7\n\nFWHM\n\nIntensity\n\n60\n\n0\n6\n\n-20\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 2. RHEED specular spot intensity and FWHM as monitored during the\ngrowth of a relatively thick film of LSMO on STO (001)c . The graph shows the 7th to\n32nd oscillation. A recovery of the RHEED oscillation intensity maximum, followed\nby a rapid decrease, is observed around the 20th unit cell layer.\n\nduring the initial growth of LSMO. The intensity shows oscillations which correspond\nto the growth of the individual unit cell layers. Within the oscillations, recovery of the\nintensity after the sudden decrease during the laser burst is observed, as shown more\nclearly in the inset of the graph. The oscillation amplitude decreases with the amount\nof material deposited during the first part of the growth. This decrease of the intensity\nis due to the difference in reflectivity of the STO surface and the LSMO surface, due to\nthe increased scattering from the heavy La ions in the lattice. Finally, the full width\nat the half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity of the specular spot, measured along\nthe (10) direction, is presented as well. During the growth, the RHEED spots are\nperiodically more streaky, because more stepedge scattering is present at half unit cell\nlayer coverage compared to full unit cell layer coverage. Therefore, the FWHM oscillates\nas well. The FWHM depends only on the shape of the intensity distribution and not on\nthe total intensity and it is therefore a better indicator of the surface morphology than\nthe main intensity of the reflection. As can be seen in the figure, the FWHM during the\ngrowth is almost equal to the FWHM of the substrate reflection indicating a smooth\nsurface morphology. From these measurements it is concluded that the initial stage of\nthe LSMO growth proceeds in the ideal 2D layer-by-layer growth mode.\nDuring the growth of the film, an increase of the RHEED oscillation maximum\nintensity was observed, as presented in figure 2. The oscillation intensity maximum\ntypically peaked around 20 to 25 unit cell layers. The origin of the maximum in intensity\nis not understood. The maximum in intensity was not observed during growth on an Asite terminated substrate surface (SrRuO3 film grown on STO [29]), so it might indicate\na termination conversion. After this peak the oscillation intensity maximum decreased\nrapidly and the oscillation amplitude became comparable to the intensity variations in\nthe laser pulse recovery cycles. It is concluded that the LSMO growth mode during the\nlatter part of the growth is close to the steady state growth mode which is characterized\n\n\f6\n\nOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 3. Surface morphology as measured with ex situ AFM. a) 20 unit cell layers\nof LSMO grown on STO. b) 30 unit cell layers of LSMO grown on STO. Both images\nare 2 by 2 \u03bcm.\n\nby a relatively constant step density, which is large compared to the step density of the\ninitial substrate surface.\n2.4. Surface morphology\nThe surface morphology of the films was studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM).\nThe images showed smooth surfaces as shown in the examples presented in figure 3.\nThe step and terrace structure of the substrate is still observed on the surface of the\nfilms. Figure 3a shows the surface morphology of a 20 unit cell layer film which was\ncompletely grown in the 2D layer-by-layer growth mode, while figure 3b shows the\nsurface morphology of a 30 unit cell layer film where the growth changed to the steady\nstate growth mode. For the latter film islands with unit cell height are observed on the\nterraces. The root mean square roughness of the samples is 0.15 nm (20 uc sample)\nand 0.21 nm (30 uc sample) respectively. For LSMO, it is known that off-stoichiometric\ndeposition results in precipitate formation on the surface [23]. Such precipitates have\nnot been observed.\n3. Crystal structure\nThe crystal structure of the LSMO thin films was analyzed with the use of xray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The measurements were performed using a\nPANalytical X'Pert materials diffractometer or at the beamline 7-2 of the Stanford\nSynchrotron Radiation Laboratory.\nThe LSMO bulk rhombohedral crystal structure [30] is incommensurate with the\nsquare/rectangular surface unit cells of the substrates. The LSMO is therefore under\nboth normal strain as well as shear strain [31]. To accommodate this strain LSMO\nadopts a different crystal symmetry, namely a distorted (monoclinic) orthorhombic\nunit cell with space group P21 /m [32]. The orthorhombic unit cell is (110)o oriented\nout-of-plane with [110]o and [001]o in-plane orientations. To confirm that the LSMO\nlayers were grown in a fully coherent fashion with respect to the underlying substrate,\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

The clear\noscillations indicate a high quality sample with a smooth substrate film interface and a\nsmooth film surface, as was also concluded from the AFM measurements.\n4. Functional properties\nThe functional properties of LSMO are its magnetization and electrical transport. Here,\nmeasurements are presented of an 11.5 nm LSMO film grown on STO (001)c . The\nsample thickness was determined by counting RHEED oscillations and was confirmed\nwith an XRD reflectivity measurement. The sample has a Curie temperature of 350 K,\na low temperature saturation magnetization of 4.0\u00b10.05 \u03bcB /Mn and a low temperature\nresistivity of 70 \u03bc\u03a9cm.\n4.1. Magnetization\nThe magnetization of the sample was measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer\n(VSM) (Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) by Quantum Design).\nFigure 6a shows the low temperature magnetization loop, obtained at 10 K with the\nfield applied along the [100]pc axis and after subtraction of a diamagnetic background\nfrom the substrate. The saturation magnetization is reached for an applied field strength\nlarger than 50 kA/m (\u2248630 Oe) and is equal to 4.0\u00b10.05 \u03bcB /Mn. This implies that next\nto the expected 3.7 \u03bcB /Mn spin angular momentum also 0.3 \u03bcB /Mn orbital angular\nmomentum is present in the LSMO. Saturation values of 4 or more \u03bcB /Mn have been\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n1E-3\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n1E-4\n\nMagnetoresistance (\n\ncm)\n\n0.01\n\nResistivity (\n\n9\n\n)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFigure 7. Electrical transport measurements of 11.5 nm LSMO grown on STO (001)c .\nTemperature dependent resistivity and magnetoresistance. The solid black line is a fit\nto the low temperature resistivity data, as discussed in the main text.\n\nobserved earlier in single crystals with doping x=0.1 and x=0.2 [33] and in LSMO\npolycrystals [34]. The magnetization at remanence, 2.7 \u03bcB /Mn, is significantly smaller\nthan the saturation magnetization. This is partially because the measurement is along\nthe magnetic hard axis [35], and partially because the weak magnetic anisotropy of\nLSMO on STO results in nanoscale domain formation [36]. The magnetization is very\nsoft with a coercivity of 1.6 kA/m (\u224820 Oe).\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetization is presented in figure 6b. For\neach datapoint in the graph, a full hysteresis loop between 240 and -240 kA/m\n(\u22483000 Oe) was measured and the saturation magnetization was calculated after the\nbackground subtraction. The Curie temperature of the sample is 350 K. The saturation\nmagnetization follows the Brillouin functional dependence for a Weiss ferromagnet [37].\nThe curve calculated using J=4, J is the total angular momentum, results in the best\nfit of the data. This indicates either that the spins in the LSMO behave not completely\nclassically (the case of J=\u221e) and not completely quantum mechanically (J= 12 ), but\nshow intermediate behaviour or that spin wave excitations play an important role in the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetization.\n4.2. Electrical transport\nThe resistivity of the samples was measured in the van der Pauw configuration [38]\n(PPMS by Quantum Design). In order to obtain ohmic contacts between the aluminium\nbonding wires and the LSMO layer, gold contacts were deposited on the corners of the\nsample with the use of a shadow mask. Measurements were performed as a function\nof temperature (10-350 K) and magnetic field (0-2.5 T). The temperature dependent\nresistivity of the sample is shown in figure 7. The sample shows metallic behaviour\nwith a residual resistivity at 10 K of 70 \u03bc\u03a9cm. For thicker films (\u226520 nm), a residual\nresistivity of 60 \u03bc\u03a9cm was measured. The low temperature part of the resistivity curve\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n10\n\ncan be described with the relation:\n\u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 + aT 2 + bT 5 ,\n\n(1)\n\nin which \u03c10 is the temperature independent impurity scattering and the T 2 (T 5 ) term\ndescribes electron electron (electron phonon) scattering. A fit using equation 1 is shown\nin the figure and it decribes the curve up to a temperature of 300 K well. At 300 K\na discontinuity in the slope of the resistivity curve is observed and above 300 K the\nresistivity increases faster compared to the model, indicating the approach of the metal\ninsulator transition at TC .\nFigure 7 also presents the magnetoresistivity as a function of temperature. At\neach temperature the magnetic field is swept between -2.5 and 2.5 T and the\nmagnetoresistivity at 2.5 T (\u03c1(2.5T ) \u2212 \u03c1(0))/\u03c1(0) is shown. The magnetoresistance\nis negative and largest, -16 %, at the Curie temperature. Hall effect measurements\ndetermined the charge carriers to be holes, as expected for LSMO. The observed Hall\ncoefficient RH =4.6*10\u22124 cm3 /C implies a carrier density of approximately 0.8 hole/unit\ncell, which is in reasonable agreement with earlier measurements on single crystals [39].\n5. Photoelectron spectroscopy\nSeveral LSMO thin films were characterized with in situ x-ray and ultra violet\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS). The measurements were performed with\nan XPS/UPS system designed by Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH, equipped with an\nEA 125 electron energy analyzer. For XPS an Al K\u03b1 source (XM 1000) was used and\nthe UV light source is a He plasma lamp (HIS 13) operated at the HeI (21.22 eV)\nexcitation edge. The base pressure of the system was below 10\u221210 mbar. The analyzer\nwas calibrated with the use of an in situ sputter cleaned Au sample.\nFigure 8 shows a survey scan of a 10 unit cell layer LSMO sample grown on (001)c\nSTO. The main features include the La 3d peaks at 850 eV, the oxygen 1s peak at\n531 eV, the Mn 2p peaks at 640 eV and the Sr and La peaks at low binding energy.\nNext to this a small Ti peak originating from the substrate can be seen at 460 eV.\nNo indications for the presence of impurity atoms, including carbon contamination,\nwas found. This is attributed to the in situ measurement. No attempts have been\nmade to quantify the composition of the film, as large uncertainty margins exist for the\nelement sensitivity factors required to normalize measured peak intensities. From XRD\nand functional properties measurements it is clear that the composition of the films is\nequal to the desired LSMO composition within the rather large error margin of the XPS\nmeasurements.\nThe inset of figure 8 shows the valence band spectrum as measured with UPS at\nroom temperature. No Fermi edge is observed, the photoelectron count increases linearly\nwith binding energy up to a value of 1.5 eV, after which a steep increase is observed.\nThe absence of the Fermi edge is not surprising. In literature, several studies have\nobserved a Fermi edge, but only at low (<50K) temperature [40, 41] or using resonant\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n12\n\nLa 3d\n\n11\n\n10\n8\n\n10\n\n6\n\nO 1s\n\nCounts\n\n8\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n6\n\nMn 2p\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n4\nSr 3d\nLa 4d\n\n2\n\n0\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nBinding energy (eV)\n\nFigure 8.

The inset shows\nthe photoelectron intensity in the region close to the Fermi energy measured with UPS.\nThe measurements were performed at room temperature.\n\nphotoemission spectroscopy [42]. LSMO's electron density at the Fermi energy is much\nreduced compared to band theory due to the presence of the pseudogap [41, 43] and\ndisappears above the Curie temperature. It is therefore natural that the Fermi edge\ncannot easily be observed in a room temperature measurement. The steep increase of\nthe electron density below 1.5 eV is in good agreement with the literature [40].\nSeveral authors have suggested that Sr or Ca segregation towards the surface of\nthe film is an intrinsic effect in LSMO (or La0.67 Ca0.33 MnO3 (LCMO) respectively) thin\nfilms [44, 24]. Angle dependent XPS measurements can be used to study changes in\nthe composition of a thin film in the surface layer. The results obtained for a 10 unit\ncell layer film grown on (001)c STO are presented in table 1. A film thickness of ten\nunit cell layers was chosen for this experiment in order to directly compare with the 1\nto 9 unit cell layer experiments by Herger et al.[24]. If thinner LSMO layers would be\nused the XPS Sr signal would gain relative intensity due to a substrate contribution,\naffecting the measurement. As the relative intensity of peaks measured at different\ntake-off angles does not depend on the element sensitivity factors, quantitative analysis\nis possible. The Sr 3d peak at 135 eV was compared with the La 4d peak at 105 eV and\nfor both elements, an intensity ratio between bulk and surface sensitive measurements of\n1.5\u00b10.05 was found. This limits the off-stoichiometry of the surface to within 6%. In the\nexample in literature [24] it is mentioned that the topmost layer has a La/Sr ratio of 0.5\ninstead of 2, while the subsequent layers are stoichiometric. Based on an electron escape\ndepth of 2 nm for electrons with kinetic energy of 1350 eV [45], Herger's 9 unit cell layer\nsample would show an off-stoichiometry of 33% in the XPS measurement. Therefore, it\nis concluded that Sr segregation is much reduced in these samples as compared to the\nsamples of Herger et al.. It is known that the Sr segregation depends on the oxygen\npartial pressure [46]. Therefore, the lack of Sr segregation can be attributed to the high\n\n\f12\n\nOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\nTable 1.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy\nA multilayer LSMO/STO sample was characterized with scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM), to study the interface atomic structure.

The sample is comprised of several layers,\nfrom substrate to surface: 4 nm LSMO, 2 nm STO, 16 nm LSMO, 2 nm STO and 8 nm\nLSMO.\nFigure 9a presents a low magnification HAADF image of the different layers in the\nsample.

Comparison to other groups\nTable 2 presents an overview of the most important properties of LSMO thin films.\nData taken from different research groups is included in order to compare the thin film\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n14\n\nquality. For reference also the properties of a single crystal are mentioned. All films\nwere grown on STO (001)c substrates by PLD, except for the samples grown in Illinois,\nfor which MBE was used. Most groups published AFM measurements of the surface\nmorphology, which showed smooth surfaces with the step and terrace structure of the\nsubstrate clearly visible. Two groups, the Illinois group and the Rome group, did not\npublish images of the film surface morphology, but they did present a RHEED image\nfrom which it was concluded that the films were smooth [51, 55]. The Rome group\nmentions that their films have a metal-insulator transition temperature of 370 K. This\ntemperature is defined in their papers as the temperature at which the resistivity of the\nfilms has a maximum and it is not equal to the Curie temperature. The value mentioned\nin the table is deduced from the temperature dependence of the magnetization plot in\n[57]. The data from the 20 unit cell layer sample was used, which has a similar metalinsulator transition temperature as their thick samples.\nIn general, a similar crystal structure with an out-of-plane lattice parameter of 3.83\nto 3.85 \u00c5 and a similar surface morphology is obtained. Nevertheless, differences in the\nfunctional properties are present. We therefore suspect that these differences are due to\nsmall variations in the stoichiometry of the films, e.g. the La/Sr ratio and the degree of\noxygenation of the film.\nA high quality sample should combine a high TC with a high saturation\nmagnetization and a low residual resistivity. The samples described here have the\nhighest saturation magnetization, a high TC and a low residual resistivity. Only the\nsamples from the Illinois group have a lower residual resistivity while both the Illinois\nand the Tokyo group obtained a slightly higher TC . We obtained a higher saturation\nmagnetization, 4.0 \u03bcB /Mn in contrast to the 3.2 \u03bcB /Mn reported by the Illinois group.\nThe Tokyo group did not report the saturation magnetization, but the magnetization\nvalue at 200 K can be compared; 2.7 \u03bcB /Mn (Tokyo [58]) versus 3.2 \u03bcB /Mn (this work).\nCombining all three properties it is concluded that the samples of this work combine\nboth a high magnetization with a low residual resistivity and have the highest quality\nreported so far in literature.\n8. Conclusion\nIn this article, an overview of the fabrication and the properties of high quality LSMO\nthin films was presented. The films have a saturation magnetization of 4.0 \u03bcB /Mn, a\nCurie temperature of 350 K and a residual resistivity of 60 \u03bc\u03a9cm. XPS measurements\nshow the absence of chemical impurities and no evidence for surface segregation. STEM\nmeasurements show that multi-layer structures with sharp interfaces were realized.\nThese results indicate that high quality films, combining both large magnetization and\nsmall residual resistivity, were realized. For LSMO devices, the thin film quality is crucial\nfor the device performance. Therefore, this research is important for the application of\nLSMO in devices.\n\n\fOptimized fabrication of high quality La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films\n\n15\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was financially supported by the Dutch Science Foundation, by NanoNed,\na nanotechnology program of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and by the\nNanOxide program of the European Science Foundation.
