Introduction\nWe describe a new fiber-diffraction interferometer using a coherent fiber optic taper\nfor stabilizing interference fringes in an uncontrolled environment. Manufacturing\ntechnology of optical components such as lenses and mirrors has evolved from the\ntraditional polishing process to the automated machining process. Diamond turning\nmachine is now able to achieve sub-\u03bcm accuracy over a few hundreds of millimeters in\ndiameter. And injection molding technology produces high quality optical components\nwith unprecedented yield rate. Testing those optics depends on optical interferometers\ndue to their fast 2 dimensional measurement and quality inspection at the operational\nwavelength of the test optics. But the interferometer is so vulnerable to the external\nvibration that isolating the test table from the machining bed is essential in most cases.\nThis fact deters the interferometer system from being united with the machining center\nas a truly repeatable feedback sensor. Nowadays, researches on vibration insensitive\n(anti-vibration) interferometers have been spurred to meet those industrial demands,\nincluding large scale optics used for ignition facility and telescope optics [1]. Several\ntechniques are used for desensitizing the interferometer to the external vibration and can\nbe categorized into 3 classes; common-path configuration, vibration feedback control,\nand spatial phase shifting for real time inspection.\nCommon-path enables the vibration of test optics common to both reference and\nmeasurement waves, whereby interference fringe between them looks static. Point\ndiffraction interferometer by Smartt and Steel [2] is an example, which makes reference\nwave from the focused measurement wave through a pinhole. Lateral shearing\ninterferometer is a common-path interferometer and optical pick-up lenses in production\nline were tested by Cho and Kim [3]. Scatter plate interferometer is also a common-path\ninterferometer with high immunity to external vibration [4].\nAnother technique for anti-vibration is direct feedback control. Yoshino and\nYamaguchi [5] implemented a closed-loop phase shifting Fizeau interferometer where\noptical phases are detected by a two-frequency optical heterodyne method. TwymannGreen interferometer with a single point detector and an electro-optic modulator was\nalso proposed [6].\nLast category of anti-vibration technique is a single-shot interferometer with spatial\nphase shifting. Phase shifting is necessary to enhance measurement accuracy and this is\naccomplished spatially as opposed to temporal phase shifting techniques. Smythe and\nMoore [7] used polarization beam splitters and waveplates to acquire 4 phase-shifted\nfringes. Millerd et al. [8] used holographic elements and polarizers to obtain 4 phaseshifted fringe. Pixelated phase-mask can also be used for spatial phase shifting [9].\nSpatial carrier phase shifting technique is widely used due to its simple and easy\nembodiment [10]. By introducing linear tilt phase term in reference or test beam, a\nspatially modulated fringe can be obtained and analyzed with several algorithms such\nas sinusoidal fitting [11] and Fourier analysis [12].\nAforementioned anti-vibration interferometers of common-path, closed-loop\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n3\n\nfeedback control, and spatial phase shifting are vying each other with their relative\nadvantages and disadvantages. Closed-loop feedback cannot control high frequency\nvibrations over the bandwidth of control loop and the actual implementation is difficult.\nSpatial phase shifting suffers the same problem with high frequency vibrations because\nthe detector frame rate and shutter speed is generally limited. And highly repeatable\nmeasurement is practically impossible between successive tests, which lowers the system\nreliability. Common-path interferometers are ideal for stabilizing fringes in principle, but\nthey usually lack real time capability due to inherent temporal phase shifting principles.\nCombining common-path configuration with a spatial phase shifting technique can\nbe a promising solution to anti-vibration interferometry. For examples, Kwon [13] made\nthree phase-shifted fringes with a phase grating and a pinhole achieving a common-path\nreal time interferometer. Millerd et al. [14] from 4D Technology Corporation combined\na point diffraction interferometer with their spatial phase shifting interferometer. Both\ninterferometers use pinholes and their diffracting fields as reference waves. Recently,\nKihm and et al. [15] reported this type of interferometer using a single-mode fiber, but\nit suffers from difficulties of focusing aberrant measurement beam into the small core\nof a single mode fiber. Defocus or lateral vibration of the target severely affects beam\nintensity out of the single-mode fiber. Therefore fringe visibility changes when large\nvibration is involved. This paper overcomes that weakness and introduces a new type\nof interferometer.\nThe main idea of the research is condensing measurement wave through a coherent\nfiber optic taper (FOT) and a single-mode fiber (SMF) with thermally-expanded\ncore (TEC) to make reference wave. Vibration of the cavity between the target and\nthe interferometer probe is common to both reference and measurement waves, thus\nthe interference fringe is stabilized in an optical way. Generation of the reference wave\nis stable even with the target movement. Focus shift of the input measurement wave\nis desensitized by an FOT. The uncertainly of measurement results can be lowered\ndue to highly repeatable performance even with external vibrations. Principles will\nbe explained in Sec. 2 and experimental results will be detailed in Sec. 3 followed by\nconclusions in Sec. 4.\n2. Principles\nThe fiber-diffraction interferometer using an FOT is shown in Fig. 1. Any type of\nlaser, which is linearly polarized and spatially coherent, can be used as a light source.\nContinuous wave lasers like He-Ne lasers or super luminescent diodes (SLD) of short\ncoherence length can be used for general purposes. Pulse lasers could be used for\nstroboscopic inspection. The laser is filtered through a pinhole and collimated by a lens\nbecoming well-defined plane wave. Half-wave plate 1 (HWP1) rotates the polarization\nangle of the beam and controls the amount of reflected beam at the polarization beam\nsplitter 1 (PBS1). This eventually adjusts the brightness of interference fringes. A\nquarter-wave plate (QWP) with its fast axis aligned at 45\u25e6 makes the beam circularly-\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n!\n\n4\n\n!\n\n\"\n\nFigure 1. Principles of fiber-diffraction interferometer using an FOT: HWP, half-wave\nplate; QWP, quarter-wave plate; PBS, polarization beam splitter; OL, objective lens;\nCC, corner cube; P, polarizer.\n\npolarized. Objective lens (OL) or null lens in case of aspheric targets forms the beam\nwavefront fit to the target surface for reciprocation. The reflected measurement wave,\nwhich is circularly polarized, is then linearly polarized in orthogonal direction after\nthe QWP and passes through the PBS1. HWP2 rotates the polarization angle of\nthe measurement wave, thus controls the split ratio between two arms at PBS2. The\nreference arm is composed of a focusing lens, an FOT and an SMF with TEC to make\nspatially filtered wavefront. Corner cube (CC) in the measurement arm translates to\ncompensate optical path length difference between two arms. PBS3 combines those two\nbeams and polarizer (P) with 45\u25e6 filters them in diagonal direction making interference\nfringes at the detector.\nWhen phase shifting is required for wavefront analysis, detectors equipped with a\nspatial phase shifter [8, 9, 15] could be used. Translation of CC for temporal phase\nshifting might be adopted in vibration-isolated environment. In this paper, we focus\nmainly on the verification of using an FOT in fiber-diffraction interferometry. Also\nwe assume that optical parts comprising the interferometer are fixed as a single body.\nRelative motion or vibration of the test surface doesn't affect the alignment of the\ninterferometer components. This can be justified in general optical testing environment\nwhere unstable cavity between the probe and a target is the major contributor lowering\nrepeatability.\nFringe stabilization is possible even with external vibrations by making reference\nwave out of measurement wave. Shared vibrant phase which is mainly piston motion\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n5\n\ncancel out and the fringes look static. A pinhole has been used for this purpose in point\ndiffraction interferometry [2, 16]. They use a sidelobe of focused measurement wave and\ntilted fringes are inevitable. Demodulating fringes [11, 12] lowers measurement accuracy\nand high frequency features cannot be recovered. An SMF can be used due to the high\nquality wavefront output and easy embodiment [15]. But the difficulty of focusing\naberrant measurement wave into the small core of a fiber poses doubt about practical\nuses. Increasing coupling efficiency of a laser source into an SMF has been a major\nresearch activity in optical communication, and thermally expanding the core(TEC) of\na fiber is an example [17].\nIn this research we propose to use an FOT as a beam coupler for interferometric\nuses. An FOT consists of a large number of optical fibers fused together to form a\ncoherent bundle. The bundle is heat formed, resulting in variation of its diameter from\none end to the other. The magnification of a taper is simply the ratio of the diameter of\nthe end faces, which is generally 2\u20135\u00d7 [18]. The light transmission of an FOT is given in\nterms of internal transmission of glass core, Fresnel reflection at the end faces, and the\nratio of core area to the total area termed packaging fraction (PF). The transmission T\ncan be expressed as\nT = PFtf exp (\u2212\u03b2\u03bb L)\n\n(1)\n\n, where tf is the Fresnel transmission factor, \u03b2\u03bb is the absorption coefficient of the core\nglass, and L is the length of the taper [19]. The light transmission can be increased\nby anti-reflection (AR) coating on input and output ports of the taper. A pinhole or\na coated mask on the small end face blocks unwanted spurious modes [20] and passes\nonly a single-mode by point diffraction.\nImmunity to the focus shift at the input port is achieved by condensing light through\nan FOT. The input end face of a taper is placed near the aperture stop of a focusing\nobjective lens. This slightly defocused input beam looks static at the output even when\nthe vibration of the target changes the direction (tilt) and divergence angle (focus) of\nthe measurement wave. High numerical aperture (NA) of the FOT, which is 1, captures\nalmost every incoming field from the objective lens. The beam spot size at the output\nport is reduced according to the reduction ratio of the taper. Multi-mode fields at\nthe output, however, should be filtered into a single-mode to be used as reference\nwave [21, 22]. A TEC-processed SMF is used to combine individual fibers at the output\nof the FOT. Then, the reference wave from the SMF is quite stable in its amplitude\nwhile carrying vibrant phase motion of the target.\nConsidering the power of available lasers and sensitivity of detectors, transmission\nloss through an FOT and a TEC-processed SMF is not a problem in interferometric\napplications [23]. The following section explains the actual implementation and verifies\nthe use of an FOT in fiber-diffraction interferometry.\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n6\n\nFigure 2. Coupling efficiency test with respect to input focus shift: (a) singlemode fiber (SMF) only, (b) thermally-expanded core (TEC) fiber only, (c) fiber-optic\ntaper (FOT) and SMF, (d) FOT and TEC fiber; PD, photo-detector.\n\n3. Experimental Results and Discussion\nReference wave is made by fiber diffraction from the end face of an SMF. Focusing\naberrant measurement wave into the small core of SMF is difficult when the test optic\nhas vibrational motions. Axial motion makes the beam defocused at the input port.\nLateral or tilt motion shifts the beam focus and lowers the coupling efficiency more\nseverely. When large vibration is involved at the cavity between the test optic and the\ninterferometer probe, the amplitude of reference wave will fluctuate accordingly. Thus\nwe cannot get stable fringes enough for practical phase measurement. The objective of\nthis research is to get stable fringes immune to the focus shift of the measurement wave.\nWe verified the improvement of using an FOT by comparative experiments shown\nin Fig. 2. The laser is focused into an SMF and a photo-detector (PD) captures the\noutput intensity to examine the coupling efficiency. The laser is rotated to simulate tilt\nmotions of the measurement wave. We tested with 4 different set-ups; (a) using an SMF,\n(b) a TEC fiber, (c) an FOT and an SMF, and (d) an FOT and a TEC fiber. Fig. 2(a)\nis a conventional method using an SMF in fiber-diffraction interferometry. TEC fiber in\nFig. 2(b) has a longitudinal variation of the core diameter. Mode-field diameter of the\ninput end becomes 10 \u03bcm from 4 \u03bcm after the TEC process. This makes the coupling\nless sensitive to the beam focus. We used an FOT from Schott [18]. The diameter of a\nlarge end is 25 mm and the small end is 8 mm. The magnification is 3.1:1, which is the\nratio of end face diameters. The element size of each fiber at large end side is 6 \u03bcm and\nthe ratio of core and cladding area is 1:1. The PF in Eq. 1 is lower than 50% due to the\nextramural absorption (EMA) which eliminates stray light through the cladding [24].\nThe refractive index of the core is 1.810 and NA of a fiber at the end face is 1 from\nmanufacturer's specification [18].\nThe output is a convolution process between the focused laser and the input modal\nfield of fibers and the FOT. The NA of the SMF and the TEC fiber is 0.12, while the\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\nCoupled Intensity Output (a.u.)\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n0.8\n\n7\n\nSMF only\n\n(b)\n\nTEC fiber only\n\n(c)\n\nFOT with SMF\n\n(d)\n\nFOT with TEC fiber\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nAngle (deg)\n\nFigure 3. Coupled intensity outputs from the experiments shown in Fig. 2\n\nNA of the FOT is 1. The mode-field diameters of the SMF and the TEC fiber are 4 \u03bcm\nand 10 \u03bcm respectively. In case of (c) and (d) in Fig. 2, mode-field diameter depends\non the magnifications of the lens and the FOT. We used a lens with 1\u00d7 magnification\nand an FOT with 3.1\u00d7 magnification. The input mode-field diameters of Fig. 2(c) and\nFig. 2(d) are 12 \u03bcm and 31 \u03bcm respectively.\nFig. 3 shows the experimental results with the set-up shown in Fig. 2. Coupled\nintensity output from the PD is normalized in each case. Immunity to the focus shift can\nbe compared by their relative output profiles, not their maximum values. If the plot is\nsteep in a small input variation, the sensitivity to the focus shift is high. The SMF is the\nmost sensitive as shown in Fig. 3(a). The TEC fiber in Fig. 3(b) is relatively insensitive\nto the focus shift due to the enlarged mode-field diameter. The FOT has a large NA\naccepting almost every incoming field, but the EMA makes the beam fluctuate as shown\nin Fig. 3(c). This problem can be minimized by using a TEC fiber as in Fig. 3(d). The\nFOT's large NA makes the output robust to the focus shift and the TEC fiber's large\nmode-field diameter mitigates EMA effect. About 5 times improvement is observed in\nterms of acceptance angle when we compare 1/e2 intensity outputs of Fig. 3(a) and\nFig. 3(d).\nFig. 4 shows an experimental set-up of the fiber-diffraction interferometer using an\nFOT and a TEC SMF. Optical components are arranged similar to the layout of Fig. 1\nexcept for the test surface. We used a flat mirror instead of a spherical mirror. The\nflat mirror is suitable for evaluating immunity to the focus shift due to tilt motions.\nThe TEC SMF is bent 90 \u25e6 to filter out unwanted multi-modes effectively within a short\noptical path. Fig. 5(a) shows an interferogram when the test surface has a tilt angle\nof 0.02 \u25e6. Fig. 5(b) was obtained when the test surface was rotated by 0.2 \u25e6 . Fringe\nvisibility is comparable to that of Fig. 5(a). This is expected in Fig. 3(d) where the\ncoupled intensity output is over 80 % of its maximum value at the angle 0.2 \u25e6 . The\nfiber-diffraction interferometer using an SMF [15] cannot obtain fringes like Fig. 5(b).\nAs evident in Fig. 3(a), the coupled intensity output from an SMF is almost zero at the\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n8\n\nFigure 4. Experimental set-up of the fiber-diffraction interferometer using an FOT\nin Fig. 1\n\nFigure 5. Captured fringes from the set-up in Fig. 4 when the test surface is rotated\nby the angle (a) 0.02 \u25e6 and (b) 0.2 \u25e6\n\nangle 0.2 \u25e6 . This result proves the performance improvement with the use of an FOT in\nfiber-diffraction interferometry.\n4. Conclusions\nWe proposed a new fiber-diffraction interferometer using a coherent fiber optic taper for\nstabilizing fringes in vibrational optical testing environment. Reference wave is made\nby condensing measurement wave through a coherent fiber optic taper and a singlemode fiber with thermally expanded core. Experimental comparison proved the superior\ncoupling efficiency of the proposed method. Combining this technique with a spatial\nphase shifter will increase measurement repeatability as well as freezing vibrations,\nwhereby ideal vibration insensitive interferometer could be realized. Cascading multiple\nfiber optic tapers to study coupling efficiency and comparing with the state of the art\ncommercial interferometers will be the future works.\n\n\fFiber-diffraction Interferometer using Coherent Fiber Optic Taper\n\n9\n\n5.
