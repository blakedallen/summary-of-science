One such example is the subject of topological field theories (TFTs)\nwhich has encompassed in its folds such diverse areas of theoretical physics and mathematics\nas Chern-Simon theories, string theories and matrix models, two-dimensional topological\ngravity, Morse theory, Donaldson- and Jones polynomials, etc. (see, e.g., Refs. [1\u201312] and\nreferences therein). Broadly speaking, there are two types of TFTs. Witten type TFTs\n[2,3] are the ones where the quantum action (or the Lagrangian density (LW ) itself) can\nbe written as the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) (anti)commutator, i.e.,\n(w)\n\n(1.1)\n\nLW = {QB , V (\u03a6, g)}\n(w)\n\n(w)\n\n(w)\n\nwhere QB is the conserved (Q\u0307B = 0) and nilpotent ((QB )2 = 0) BRST charge (in\ngeneral, metric independent) and V (\u03a6, g) is a local expression for the field operators as a\nfunction of generic field \u03a6 and the metric g of spacetime manifold on which the theory is\ndefined. Here the BRST charge is constructed by combining a topological shift symmetry\nwith some kind of local gauge symmetries. In contrast, for the Schwarz type of TFTs [1],\nthe classical action is metric independent and the sum of gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov\nghost terms are BRST (anti)commutator. In the language of Lagrangian density (LS ), the\nSchwarz type of TFTs bear an outlook as\n(s)\n\nLS = LC + {QB , S(\u03a6, g)}\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere LC is the classical metric-independent Lagrangian density that cannot be expressed\nas the BRST (anti)commutator and S(\u03a6, g) is a local field operator that contains all the\n(s)\nmetric dependence of the theory. For the Schwarz type TFTs, the BRST charge QB\ngenerates only some local gauge symmetries (and there is no presence of a subtle local\ntopological shift symmetry, which is a characteristic feature of Witten type TFTs). It is\nnow obvious that, for both types of TFTs, the symmetric energy momentum tensor is a\nBRST (anti)commutator. This entails the Hamiltonian density of the theory to be a BRST\n(anti)commutator. As a consequence, there are no energy excitations in the physical sector\n(w,s)\nof the theory as all the physical states are BRST invariant (i.e. QB |phys >= 0). This also\nensures that all the correlation functions of the observables (i.e. BRST invariant operators)\nfor the theory are independent of the choice of the metric on the spacetime manifolds.\nFor the case of a manifold with a trivial flat metric, the TFTs are those theories where\nthere are no propagating (dynamical) degrees of freedom associated with the fields (see,\ne.g., Ref. [12]). In the present paper, we shall concentrate on the free Abelian- and selfinteracting non-Abelian gauge theories in two-dimensions of spacetime (endowed with a\nflat Minkowski metric) and show that there are no propagating degrees of freedom associated with the gauge bosons of these theories because of the presence of two nilpotent\n2\n\n\fcharges which are required to have consistency with the Hodge decomposition theorem\n(HDT). The symmetries, corresponding to these charges, gauge out the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gauge bosons and the theory becomes topological in nature. In\nfact, these nilpotent charges will be shown to be analogous to the exterior derivative d\n(d2 = 0) and co-exterior derivative \u03b4 (\u03b4 = \u00b1 \u2217 d\u2217, \u03b4 2 = 0) of differential geometry which\nare required in the definition of the HDT which states that, on a compact manifold, any\narbitrary n-form fn (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) can be written as the unique sum of a harmonic form hn\n(\u2206hn = 0, dhn = 0, \u03b4hn = 0), an exact form (den\u22121 ) and a co-exact form (\u03b4cn+1 ) as [13-17]\nfn = hn + den\u22121 + \u03b4cn+1\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere \u2206 = (d + \u03b4)2 = d\u03b4 + \u03b4d is the Laplacian operator. The set of operators (d, \u03b4, \u2206)\nis called the de Rham cohomology operators of differential geometry as they define the\ncohomological properties of a given differential form on a compact manifold.\nIt has been a long-standing problem to express the de Rham cohomology operators in\nthe language of some local symmetry properties of a given Lagrangian density. Normally,\nd(d2 = 0) operator is identified with the local BRST charge QB (Q2B = 0) which generates a local, continuous, covariant and nilpotent symmetry transformation for a BRST\ninvariant Lagrangian density corresponding to a given gauge theory. Some very interesting\nand enlightening attempts [18-21] have been made to express \u03b4 and \u2206 for the interacting\n(non)Abelian gauge theories in arbitrary spacetime dimension but the symmetry transformations turn out to be nonlocal and noncovariant. In the covariant formulation, nilpotency\nis achieved only for some specific values of the parameters of the theory [22]. Recently,\nhowever, it has been shown [23-25] that 2D free Abelian- and self-interacting non-Abelian\ngauge theories provide a couple of field theoretical models for the Hodge theory where all\nthe de Rham cohomology operators (d, \u03b4, \u2206) correspond to local and conserved charges\nwhich generate local, continuous, covariant and nilpotent (for d and \u03b4) symmetries for\nthe BRST invariant Lagrangian density of these theories. In fact, the BRST symmetry\n(analogue of d) corresponds to a transformation in which the kinetic energy terms of these\ntheories remain invariant. On the other hand, co-BRST symmetry (analogue of \u03b4) is found\nto be a symmetry transformation under which the gauge-fixing terms \u2020 remain invariant.\nThe anticommutator of these transformations (analogue of \u2206) leaves the Faddeev-Popov\nghost terms invariant. In these attempts, the topological features of these theories have\nbeen very briefly mentioned. The central aim of our present paper is to apply the insights\ngained in our earlier studies [23-25] to furnish an elaborate proof of the topological nature\nof these theories as they capture in their realm some very interesting new features. For\ninstance, the form of the Lagrangian density for these theories turns out to be like Witten\ntype TFT but the underlying symmetries are found to be of Schwarz type. Furthermore,\n\u2020\n\nThe one-form A = A\u03bc dx\u03bc defines the vector potential for the Abelian gauge theory. The zero-form\n(gauge-fixing) \u03b4A = (\u2202 * A) and the curvature two-form (field strength tensor) F (A) = dA are 'Hodge dual'\nto each-other in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime. Here \u03b4 = \u00b1 \u2217 d\u2217 is the co-exterior derivative w.r.t.\nd. The same is not true (F (N ) 6= dA) for the non-Abelian gauge theory (see, e.g., Ref. [14]).\n\n3\n\n\fthere are four sets of topological invariants for these theories. These are computed on a 2D\ncompact manifold and energy-momentum tensor is shown to be the sum of a BRST- and\nco-BRST anticommutator. By exploiting the HDT, it is demonstrated that there are no\nenergy excitations in the physical sector.\nThe outline of our present paper is as follows.\nIn section 2, we set up the notations and recapitulate the essentials of our earlier work\n[23,24] so that the paper can be self-contained. Here we show that the 2D free Abelian gauge\ntheory is a topological field theory by exploiting the basic ingredients of BRST cohomology\nand HDT. We demonstrate further that this free theory is also a perfect example of a\nHodge theory where, not only the cohomological operators (d, \u03b4, \u2206) are expressed in terms\nof generators for some local symmetries, but even the Hodge duality (\u2217) operation is shown\nto correspond to the existence of a couple of discrete symmetries in the theory. With respect\nto four conserved and nilpotent charges of the theory, we derive four sets of topological\ninvariants which are shown to be inter-related by the Hodge duality (\u2217) operation and the\npresence of a discrete symmetry for the ghost action. In fact, the requirement of a specific\nrelationship between the set of topological invariants w.r.t. (anti)BRST- and (anti)coBRST charges, singles out one of the two discrete symmetries of the Lagrangian density\nwhich are the analogue of Hodge (\u2217) operation.\nSection 3 is devoted to the discussion of a self-interacting 2D non-Abelian gauge theory\n(without any interaction with matter fields). We derive all the four sets of topological\ninvariants on a 2D compact manifold (w.r.t. all the conserved and nilpotent charges in the\ntheory) and obtain their recursion relations. In analogy with the Abelian gauge theory, we\nderive a discrete symmetry as an analogue of the Hodge (\u2217) operation for the non-Abelian\ngauge theory by requiring a certain specific transformation property for the topological\ninvariants of the theory. This discrete symmetry reduces to its Abelian counterpart (as\nHodge (\u2217) operation) in the limit when the coupling constant g of non-Abelian gauge\ntheory goes to zero (g \u2192 0).\nFinally, in section 4, we make some concluding remarks and point out some future directions that can be pursued for further extension of our work.\n2 Abelian gauge theory\nLet us begin with a two(1 + 1)-dimensional \u2021 BRST invariant Lagrangian density (Lb ) for\nthe free Abelian gauge theory in the Feynman gauge [26-28]\nLb = \u2212 14 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 21 (\u2202 * A)2 \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304\u2202 \u03bc C\n\n(2.1a)\n\nLb = 12 E 2 \u2212 12 (\u2202 * A)2 \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304\u2202 \u03bc C\n\n(2.1b)\n\n\u2021\n\nWe adopt the notations in which the flat 2D Minkowski metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag (+1, \u22121) and anti-symmetric\nLevi-Civita tensor \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03bb = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bb , \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122!, \u03b501 = \u03b510 = +1, F01 = \u22020 A1 \u2212 \u22021 A0 = E = \u2212\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd =\nF 10 , \u2737 = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd = (\u22020 )2 \u2212 (\u22021 )2 , f \u0307 = \u22020 f .

It has been shown [23,24] that the above Lagrangian\ndensity remains quasi-invariant (i.e. \u03b4b Lb = \u2212\u03b7\u2202\u03bc [(\u2202 * A)\u2202 \u03bc C], \u03b4d Lb = \u03b7\u2202\u03bc [E\u2202 \u03bc C\u0304]) under\nthe following on-shell (\u2737C = 0, \u2737C\u0304 = 0) nilpotent (\u03b4b2 = 0, \u03b4d2 = 0) BRST (\u03b4b )- and dual\nBRST (\u03b4d ) transformations:\n\u03b4b A\u03bc\n\u03b4b C\n\u03b4b C\u0304\n\u03b4b E\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03b4d A\u03bc = \u2212\u03b7\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd C\u0304\n\u03b4d C\u0304 = 0\n\u03b4d C = \u2212i \u03b7 E\n\u03b4d (\u2202 * A) = 0\n\n\u03b7 \u2202\u03bc C\n0\n\u2212i \u03b7 (\u2202 * A)\n0\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is an anticommuting (\u03b7C = \u2212C\u03b7, \u03b7 C\u0304 = \u2212C\u0304\u03b7) spacetime independent transformation parameter. It will be noticed that, under \u03b4b , it is the electric field E (derived by the\napplication of d on one-form A = A\u03bc dx\u03bc ) that remains invariant and the gauge-fixing term\ntransforms (to compensate for the term coming from the variation of ghost term). In contrast, under \u03b4d , it is the gauge-fixing term (\u2202 * A) (derived from one-form A = A\u03bc dx\u03bc by the\napplication of \u03b4) that remains invariant and the electric field transforms. The conserved,\nlocal and nilpotent (Q2b = 0, Q2d = 0) generators for the above transformations are\nQb =\n\nZ\n\ndx [ \u22020 (\u2202 * A)C \u2212 (\u2202 * A)\u010a ]\n\nQd =\n\nZ\n\ndx [ E C\u0304 \u0307 \u2212 \u0116 C\u0304 ].\n\n(2.3)\n\nIt is very natural to expect that the anticommutator of these two transformations ({\u03b4b , \u03b4d } =\n\u03b4w ) would also be the symmetry transformation (\u03b4w ) for the Lagrangian density. This is\nindeed the case as can be seen that under the following bosonic (\u03ba = \u2212i\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 ) transformations\n\u03b4w A\u03bc = \u03ba(\u2202\u03bc E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd (\u2202 * A))\n\u03b4w E = \u03ba\u2737(\u2202 * A)\n\u03b4w C = 0\n\n\u03b4w (\u2202 * A) = \u03ba\u2737E\n\u03b4w C\u0304 = 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nthe Lagrangian density (2.1) transforms as: \u03b4w Lb = \u03ba\u2202 [ E\u2202 \u03bc (\u2202 * A) \u2212 (\u2202 * A)\u2202 \u03bc E ]. Here\n\u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are the transformation parameters corresponding to \u03b4b and \u03b4d respectively. The\ngenerator for the above transformation is\nW =\n\nZ\n\ndx [ \u22020 (\u2202 * A)E \u2212 (\u22020 E)(\u2202 * A) ].\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe global scale invariance of the Lagrangian density (2.1) under C \u2192 e\u2212\u03a3 C, C\u0304 \u2192\ne\u03a3 C\u0304, A\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc , (where \u03a3 is a global parameter), leads to the derivation of a conserved\nghost charge (Qg )\nZ\nQg = \u2212i dx [ C C\u0304 \u0307 + C\u0304 \u010a ].\n(2.6)\nTogether, these conserved charges satisfy the following algebra [23,24]\n[W, Qk ] = 0\nk = g, b, d, ab, ad\n2\n2\n2\nQb = Qd = Qab = Q2ad = 0\n{Qd , Qad } = 0\n{Qb , Qd } = {Qab , Qad } = W\n{Qb , Qab } = 0\ni[Qg , Qb ] = Qb\ni[Qg , Qab ] = \u2212Qab\ni[Qg , Qd ] = \u2212Qd\ni[Qg , Qad ] = Qad\n5\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fwhere Qab and Qad are the anti-BRST- and anti-dual BRST charges which can be readily\nobtained from (2.3) by the replacement :C \u2192 \u00b1iC\u0304, C\u0304 \u2192 \u00b1iC \u00a7 . It can be seen that the\nghost number for Qb and Qad is +1 and that of Qd and Qab is \u22121. Now, given a state |\u03c6 >\n(with ghost number n) in the quantum Hilbert space (i.e. iQg |\u03c6 >= n|\u03c6 >), it can be\nreadily seen, using the above algebra (2.7), that\niQg Qb |\u03c6 > = (n + 1)Qb |\u03c6 >\niQg Qd |\u03c6 > = (n \u2212 1)Qd |\u03c6 >\niQg W |\u03c6 > = n W |\u03c6 > .\n\niQg Qad |\u03c6 >= (n + 1)Qad |\u03c6 >\niQg Qab |\u03c6 >= (n \u2212 1)Qab |\u03c6 >\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis shows that the ghost numbers for the states Qb |\u03c6 > (or Qad |\u03c6 >), Qd |\u03c6 > (or Qab |\u03c6 >)\nand W |\u03c6 > in the quantum Hilbert space are (n + 1), (n \u2212 1) and n respectively. As far as\nunderlying algebra is concerned, the above symmetry generators Qb , Qd and W obey the\nsame kind of algebra as their counterparts (de Rham cohomology operators d, \u03b4 and \u2206) in\ndifferential geometry. The latter algebra can be succinctly expressed as\nd2 = 0\n\u03b42 = 0\n\u2206 = (d + \u03b4)2 = d\u03b4 + \u03b4d\n[\u2206, d] = 0\n[\u2206, \u03b4] = 0\n\u2206 = {d, \u03b4} =\n6 0.\n\n(2.9a)\n\nIt is a peculiarity of the BRST formalism that the above cohomological operators can be\nalso identified with the generators Qad , Qab and W = {Qab , Qad } respectively. Thus, the\nmapping is: (Qb , Qad ) \u21d4 d, (Qd , Qab ) \u21d4 \u03b4, W = {Qb , Qd } = {Qad , Qab } \u21d4 \u2206. This\nanalogy enables us to express the Hodge decomposition theorem in the quantum Hilbert\nspace of states where any arbitrary state |\u03c6 >n (with ghost number n) can be written as\nthe sum of a harmonic state |\u03c9 >n (W |\u03c9 >n = 0, Qb |\u03c9 >n = 0, Qd |\u03c9 >n = 0), a BRST exact\nstate (Qb |\u03b8 >n\u22121 ) and a co-BRST exact state (Qd |\u03c7 >n+1 ). Mathematically, this statement\n(which is the analogue of eqn. (1.3)) can be expressed, in two equivalent ways, as\n|\u03c6 >n = |\u03c9 >n +Qb |\u03b8 >n\u22121 +Qd |\u03c7 >n+1 \u2261 |\u03c9 >n +Qad |\u03b8 >n\u22121 +Qab |\u03c7 >n+1 .\n\n(2.9b)\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the sets of charges (Qb , Qd ) and (Qab , Qad )) are the dual\nsets, because Qb and Qd are dual to each-other as are Qab and Qad . To elaborate this claim,\nit can be seen that, under the following separate and independent transformations\nC \u2192 \u00b1iC\u0304\n\nC\u0304 \u2192 \u00b1iC\n\nC \u2192 \u00b1iC\u0304\n\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc\n\nC\u0304 \u2192 \u00b1iC\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u2192 \u00b1i\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd\n\nA\u03bc \u2192 \u2213i\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bd\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nthe two-form (electric) field E and the zero-form (gauge-fixing) field (\u2202 * A) are related\nwith each-other as: E \u2192 \u00b1i(\u2202 * A), (\u2202 * A) \u2192 \u00b1iE. Thus, we see that under the above\ntransformations: (i) the Lagrangian density (2.1) remains invariant. (ii) The dual BRST\n\u00a7\nNote that the discrete transformations:\nC \u2192 \u00b1iC\u0304, C\u0304 \u2192 \u00b1iC are the symmetry transformations for\nR\nthe ghost action (IF.P. = \u2212i dD x \u2202\u03bc C\u0304\u2202 \u03bc C) in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime.\n\n6\n\n\fsymmetry transformations \u03b4d can be obtained from the BRST transformations \u03b4b in (2.2).\n(iii) The symmetry generators Qk , (k = b, ab, d, ad, g) and W transform as:\nQb \u2192 Qd Qd \u2192 Qb Qab \u2192 Qad\nQad \u2192 Qab Qg \u2192 \u2212Qg W \u2192 W.\n\n(2.12)\n\n(iv) The algebraic structure of (2.7) remains form-invariant under (2.12).\nThe transformations (2.10) and (2.11) are the analogue of the Hodge (\u2217) operation\nof differential geometry. To clarify this assertion, first, we note the consequences of two\nsuccessive operations of (\u2217) on the generic field \u03a6 of the theory, namely;\n\u2217 ( \u2217 \u03a6) = \u00b1 \u03a6.\n\n(2.13)\n\nHere \u2217 operation corresponds to transformations (2.10) and (+) sign stands for \u03a6 = A\u03bc\nand (\u2212) sign for \u03a6 = C, C\u0304, E, (\u2202 * A). Under transformations (2.11), the analogue of (2.13)\nis \u2217 (\u2217 \u03a6) = \u2212\u03a6 for all the fields of the theory (i.e. \u03a6 = A\u03bc , C, C\u0304, E, (\u2202 * A). Now, it is\nstraightforward to check that \u03b4d and \u03b4b are related to each other as\n\u03b4d \u03a6 = \u00b1 \u2217 \u03b4b \u2217 \u03a6\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03b4d and \u03b4b are the nilpotent transformations in (2.2) and the (\u2217) operation corresponds to transformations in (2.10). The signs in (2.14) are governed by the corresponding\nsignatures in (2.13). For the (\u2217) operation corresponding to (2.11), the analogue of (2.14),\nis\n\u03b4d \u03a6 = \u2212 \u2217 \u03b4b \u2217 \u03a6\n(2.15)\nfor the generic field \u03a6 = A\u03bc , C, C\u0304, E, (\u2202*A). It is obvious that the relation between nilpotent\ntransformations \u03b4d and \u03b4b , acting on a generic field \u03a6, is same as the relation between dual\nexterior derivative \u03b4(= \u00b1\u2217d\u2217) and exterior derivative d acting on a differential form defined\non a compact manifold. It will be noticed that duality transformations in 2D and 4D are\ndifferent [29-31]. This is the reason that, for the 4D (3 + 1) theories, it has been shown\n[32] that under \u2217 operation: Qb \u2192 Qd , Qd \u2192 \u2212Qb which is like the electromagnetic duality\ntransformations for the Maxwell equations where: E \u2192 B, B \u2192 \u2212E . In fact, it is due\nto the peculiarity of duality transformations in 2D that a reverse relation also exist which\nallows one to express \u03b4b in terms of \u03b4d as\n\u03b4b \u03a6 = \u00b1 \u2217 \u03b4d \u2217 \u03a6\n\nand\n\n\u03b4b \u03a6 = \u2212 \u2217 \u03b4d \u2217 \u03a6\n\n(2.16)\n\ncorresponding to transformations (2.10) and (2.11), respectively.\nExploiting the fact that conserved charges Qr (r = b, d, ab, ad) are the generators for\nthe transformations \u03b4r \u03a6 = \u2212i \u03b7[ \u03a6, Qr ]\u00b1 where (+)\u2212 stand for the (anti)commutator\ncorresponding to \u03a6 being (fermionic)bosonic in nature, it can be readily seen that the\nLagrangian density in (2.1) can be written, modulo some total derivatives, as\nLb = {Qd , T1 } + {Qb , T2 } \u2261 {Qad , P1 } + {Qab , P2 }\n7\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fwhere T1 = 21 EC, T2 = \u2212 12 (\u2202 * A)C\u0304, P1 = 2i E C\u0304, P2 = \u2212 2i (\u2202 * A)C. Furthermore, using\nthe on-shell nilpotent symmetries of (2.2), it can be checked that the above Lagrangian\ndensity can be re-expressed as a sum of the (anti)BRST- and (anti)-dual BRST invariant\nparts and a total derivative, as\n\u03b7Lb = \u03b4d (iT1 ) + \u03b4b (iT2 ) + \u03b7 \u2202\u03bc Y \u03bc \u2261 \u03b4ad (iP1 ) + \u03b4ab (iP2 ) + \u03b7 \u2202\u03bc Y \u03bc\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere the nilpotent transformations \u03b4ab and \u03b4ad can be readily derived from (2.2) by exploiting the substitution: C \u2192 iC\u0304, C\u0304 \u2192 iC and Y \u03bc = 2i (C\u0304\u2202 \u03bc C + \u2202 \u03bc C\u0304C). The appearance\nof the Lagrangian density (2.1) (in the form (2.17)) is reminiscent of the Witten-type topological field theories (1.1) where it is possible to express the Lagrangian density of a TFT\nas a BRST (anti)commutator. Even though in our case, we have two sets of nilpotent\ncharges (Qb , Qd ) as well as (Qab , Qad ), the outlook of the Lagrangian density (2.17) is same\nas the Witten type TFTs because the physical states are the harmonic states (of the Hodge\ndecomposition theorem) which satisfy Q(b,ab) |phys >= 0, Q(d,ad) |phys >= 0. It should be\nnoted that the appearance in (2.17), is completely different from the Schwarz type of theories where the Lagrangian density (1.2) is a sum of a BRST (anti)commutator and a piece\nthat can never be expressed as a BRST (anti)commutator [1,12]. At this stage, however, we\nnote that we have only local gauge type symmetries and there is no trace of any topological\nshift symmetries. Hence, it is clear that, from the symmetry point of view, the free 2D\nU(1) gauge theory is like Schwarz type topological theories.\nOne of the key properties of TFTs is the absence of any energy excitations in the\ntheory. This aspect is governed by the expression for the symmetric energy-momentum\n(s)\ntensor (T\u03b1\u03b2 ). It is interesting to check that the expression for this symmetric tensor for\nthe generic field \u03a6 = A\u03bc , C, C\u0304, present in the Lagrangian density (2.1), is\n(s)\n\nT\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u2202Lb 1\n\u2202Lb\n+ 2 \u2202\u03b2 \u03a6\n\u2212 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 Lb\n\u2202\u03b2 \u03a6\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03a6\n\u2261 \u2212 21 [ \u03b5\u03b1\u03c1 E + \u03b7\u03b1\u03c1 (\u2202 * A) ] \u2202\u03b2 A\u03c1 \u2212 21 [ \u03b5\u03b2\u03c1 E + \u03b7\u03b2\u03c1 (\u2202 * A) ] \u2202\u03b1 A\u03c1\n\u2212 i\u2202\u03b1 C\u0304\u2202\u03b2 C \u2212 i\u2202\u03b2 C\u0304\u2202\u03b1 C \u2212 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 Lb .\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03a6\n\nThis equation, with the use of (2.17), can be explicitly expressed as\n(s)\n\n(1)\n\n(2.19a)\n\n\u00b6\n\n(2)\n\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = {Qb , V\u03b1\u03b2 } + {Qd , V\u03b1\u03b2 }\n(1)\nV\u03b1\u03b2 = 12 [ (\u2202\u03b1 C\u0304)A\u03b2 + (\u2202\u03b2 C\u0304)A\u03b1 + \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 (\u2202 * A)C\u0304 ]\n(2)\nV\u03b1\u03b2 = 12 [ (\u2202\u03b1 C)\u03b5\u03b2\u03c1 A\u03c1 + (\u2202\u03b2 C)\u03b5\u03b1\u03c1 A\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 EC ].\n\n(2.19b)\n\n(s)\n\nThis shows that, when the Hamiltonian density T\u030200 is sandwiched between two physical\n(s)\nstates (i.e. < phys|T\u030200 |phys\u2032 >= 0) it turns out to be zero because hermitian operators\nQb , Qd annihilate the harmonic states (which are the BRST- and co-BRST invariant physical\n\u00b6\n\nHere, and in what follows, we shall be exploiting only nilpotent charges Qb and Qd for our purposes.\nHowever, Qab and Qad could be used equally well for the same objectives.

In other\nwords, there is no evolution in the system w.r.t. the evolution (time) parameter of the\ntheory. This condition confirms the topological nature of the free 2D U(1) gauge theory in\nthe flat Minkowski spacetime.\nThe topological nature is further confirmed by the existence of two sets of topological\ninvariants w.r.t. conserved and on-shell (\u2737C = \u2737C\u0304 = 0) nilpotent (Q2b = 0, Q2d = 0)\nBRST- and co-BRST charges.

It is very interesting to note\nthat, under (\u2217) operation corresponding to transformations in (2.10), the above topological\ninvariants, for k = 0, 1, 2, transform as\nVk \u2192 Wk\n\n\u1e7ck \u2192 W\u0303k\n\nWk \u2192 (\u22121)k Vk\n\nW\u0303k \u2192 (\u22121)k \u1e7ck .\n\n(2.24)\n\nMathematically, this statement can be succinctly expressed as\n\u2217 Vk = Wk\n\n\u2217 \u1e7ck = W\u0303k\n\n\u2217 (\u2217 Vk ) = (\u22121)k Vk\n\n\u2217 (\u2217 \u1e7ck ) = (\u22121)k \u1e7ck\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere \u2217 operation corresponds to transformations in (2.10) and k = 0, 1, 2 stands for the\ndegree of the forms on the 2D compact manifold. Another interesting point to be noted\nis the fact that the requirement: Ik \u2192 Jk under \u2217 operation, singles out transformations\n9\n\n\f(2.10) from (2.10) and (2.11) which are symmetry transformations for the Lagrangian\ndensity (2.1). This assertion will play an important role in the discussion of topological\ninvariants and their transformations under \u2217 operation for the case of non-Abelian gauge\ntheory (see, e.g., Sec. 3 below).\nTo conclude this section, we note that 2D free U(1) gauge theory is a prototype example of a field theoretical model for the Hodge theory. This theory also turns out to be a\nnew type of topological field theory. The form of its Lagrangian density looks like Witten\ntype of TFTs but its symmetries are just like that of Schwarz type TFTs (as there is a\nconspicuous absence of the topological shift symmetry in the theory).\n3 Non-Abelian gauge theory\nLet us start off with the (1 + 1)-dimensional BRST invariant Lagrangian density (LB ) for\nthe self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theory in the Feynman gauge [26-28]\na\n\u2212 21 (\u2202 * A)a (\u2202 * A)a \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 a D \u03bc C a\nLB = \u2212 14 F \u03bc\u03bda F\u03bc\u03bd\n= 12 E a E a \u2212 12 (\u2202 * A)a (\u2202 * A)a \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 a D \u03bc C a\n\n(3.1)\n\na\nwhere F01\n= \u22020 Aa1 \u2212 \u22021 Aa0 + gf abc Ab0 Ac1 = E a is the \"coloured\" (group-valued) electric field\nderived from the \"coloured\" gauge connections Aa0 and Aa1 , (C\u0304 a )C a are the anticommuting\nFaddeev-Popov (anti)ghost fields ((C\u0304 a )2 = (C a )2 = 0), the covariant derivative is: D\u03bc C a =\n\u2202\u03bc C a + g f abc Ab\u03bc C c , spacetime indices are: \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03bb..... = 0, 1 and group indices a, b, c.... =\n1, 2, 3... correspond to a compact Lie group, g is the coupling constant denoting the strength\nof the interaction amongst gauge fields and structure constants f abc are chosen to be totally\nantisymmetric for the above compact Lie algebra [33].

As a consequence of this algebra, it is clear that, given a state\n|\u03c8 >n with ghost number n (i.e. iQG |\u03c8 >n = n|\u03c8 >n ) in the quantum Hilbert space of\nstates, the following relations are correct\niQG W (N ) |\u03c8 >n = nW (N ) |\u03c8 >n .\n\niQG Q(B,D) |\u03c8 >n = (n \u00b1 1)Q(B,D) |\u03c8 >n\n\n(3.8)\n\nThis demonstrates that the ghost numbers for the states QB |\u03c8 >n , QD |\u03c8 >n and W (N ) |\u03c8 >n\nare (n + 1), (n \u2212 1) and n respectively. This is analogous to the change in the degree of the\nform fn , when operated upon by the cohomological operators d, \u03b4, \u2206 defined on a compact\nmanifold. It is now obvious that the Hodge decomposition theorem (1.3) can be implemented in the quantum Hilbert space of states |\u03c8 >n = |\u03c9\u0303 >n +QB |\u03b8\u0303 >n\u22121 +QD |\u03c7\u0303 >n+1\n(which is the analogue of (2.9b) for the non-Abelian case).\nIt is well-known that, for the Witten type TFTs, the Lagrangian density (or the action\nitself) is a BRST (anti)commutator (1.1). With this as a backdrop, it can be noticed that,\nmodulo some total derivatives, the Lagrangian density (3.1) can be recast as the sum of a\nBRST- and co-BRST anticommutator (or a BRST and co-BRST invariant parts)\nLB = {QD , S1 } + {QB , S2 }\n\u03b7LB = \u03b4D (iS1 ) + \u03b4B (iS2 ) S1 = 12 E a C a\n11\n\nS2 = \u2212 12 (\u2202 * A)a C\u0304 a .\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fMore precisely, the above expression can be seen to produce\nLB =\nX\u03bc =\n\n1 a a\nE E \u2212 12 (\u2202 * A)a (\u2202 * A)a\n2\ni\n(C\u0304 a D \u03bc C a + \u2202 \u03bc C\u0304 a C a ).\n2\n\n\u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 a D \u03bc C a + \u2202\u03bc [X \u03bc ]\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis shows that, with two nilpotent charges QB and QD , the Lagrangian density (3.1)\nresembles with that of the Witten type TFTs if we choose the physical states as BRST- and\nco-BRST invariant (harmonic state) in the Hodge decomposition theorem (i.e. QB |phys >=\n0, QD |phys >= 0). It will be noticed, however, that in our discussions of the symmetries for\nthe theory, we do not have any topological shift symmetry. Thus, from the symmetry angle,\n2D self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theory is like Schwarz type TFTs which possess only\nlocal gauge symmetries.\n(s)\nThe expression for the symmetric energy-momentum tensor (T\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n) for the Lagrangian\ndensity (3.1) is\n(s)\nT\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2212 12 [ \u03b5\u03bc\u03c1 E a + \u03b7\u03bc\u03c1 (\u2202 * A)a ] \u2202\u03bd A\u03c1a \u2212 12 [ \u03b5\u03bd\u03c1 E a + \u03b7\u03bd\u03c1 (\u2202 * A)a ] \u2202\u03bc A\u03c1a\n\u2212 2i (\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 a )(\u2202\u03bd C a + D\u03bd C a ) \u2212 2i (\u2202\u03bd C\u0304 a )(\u2202\u03bc C a + D\u03bc C a ) \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd LB .\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere LB is the Lagrangian in (3.1) (or equivalently (3.9)).

This will also ensure that\nthere are no energy excitations in the theory because the VEV (i.e. < vac|T\u0303\u02c6 |vac >= 0)\n00\n\nas well as the excitations in the physical states (i.e. < phys|T\u0303\u02c600 |phys\u2032 >= 0) turns out to\nbe zero.

These relations are [2,4,35]\n\u03b4B Bk = \u03b7 d Bk\u22121\n\u03b4D Dk = \u03b7 \u03b4 Dk\u22121\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b4AB Ak = \u03b7 d Ak\u22121\n(d)\n(d)\n\u03b4AD Ak\u22121 = \u03b7 \u03b4 Ak\n\nd = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc\n\u03b4 = i dx\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd .\n\n(3.22)\n\nThese properties establish the topological nature of 2D self-interacting non-Abelian gauge\ntheory. This theory belongs to a new class of TFT as is evident from its differences with\nWitten- and Schwarz type of TFTs.\nAs was emphasized at the end of equation (2.25), one can obtain an analogue of the\n(\u2217) operation from the requirement that the topological invariants of the self-interacting\nnon-Abelian gauge theory should obey the same kind of relations as (2.24) and (2.25) for\nthe Abelian gauge theory. It can be checked that under the following transformations\nC a \u2192 iC\u0304 a C\u0304 a \u2192 iC a Aa\u03bc \u2192 Aa\u03bc\nB a \u2192 \u2212iBa \u2212 ig2 f abc C b C\u0304 c Ba \u2192 \u2212iB a \u2212 2g f abc C b C\u0304 c\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b4 ab \u2192 i\u03b5\u03bc\u03c1 \u2202 \u03c1 \u03b4 ab + g2 f abc Ac\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc\u03c1 \u2202 \u03c1 \u03b4 ab \u2192 i\u2202\u03bc \u03b4 ab \u2212 ig2 f abc Ac\u03bc\n\n(3.23)\n\nthe topological invariants, for k = 0, 1, 2, transform as\nBk \u2192 Dk\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nAk \u2192 Ak\n\nDk \u2192 (\u22121)k Bk\n\n(d)\n\n(b)\n\nAk \u2192 (\u22121)k Ak .\n\n(3.24)\n\nIn the proof of the above relations, we should include in (3.23)\nBa \u2192 \u2212iB\u0304 a \u2212 g2 f abc C\u0304 b C c\nB\u0304 a \u2192 \u2212iBa \u2212 ig2 f abc C\u0304 b C c\n\n(3.25)\n\nfor the checking of the transformation properties of topological invariants w.r.t. QAB and\nQAD . In the language of the above (\u2217) operation, the relations (3.24) can be mathematically\nexpressed as\n\u2217 Bk = Dk\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n\u2217 Ak = Ak\n\n\u2217 (\u2217 Bk ) = (\u22121)k Bk\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n\u2217 (\u2217 Ak ) = (\u22121)k Ak\n\n(3.26)\n\nIt will be noticed that (3.24, 3.26)) are exactly like (2.24, 2.25). However, the transformations (3.23, 3.25) are still not the analogue of the exact Hodge dual (\u2217) operation of\n14\n\n\fdifferential geometry. Unlike the case of 2D Abelian gauge theory where this analogy was\nperfect, we see that, for the non-Abelian case, the above transformations do not keep the\nLagrangian density (3.1) or (3.13a,b) invariant. Furthermore, the dual BRST transformation \u03b4D can not be obtained from BRST transformations \u03b4B by exploiting (3.23). In\naddition, the analogues of (2.14) and (2.16) do not exist.\nWe conclude this section with the remark that self-interacting 2D non-Abelian gauge\ntheory is a topological field theory which bears the appearance of a Witten type TFT but\npossesses symmetries that are reminiscent of a Schwarz type of TFT.\n4 Summary and discussion\nIt has been shown that free Abelian- and self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theories in\n2D belong to a new class of topological field theories. The ideas of BRST cohomology\nand Hodge decomposition theorem play a pivotal role in the proof of topological nature\nof these theories. The local symmetries of these theories define the de Rham cohomology\noperators and a discrete symmetry transformation corresponds to the Hodge (\u2217) operation\nof differential geometry. As far as these symmetries are concerned, there are some specific\ndifferences as well as similarities between 2D free Abelian- and self-interacting \u2217\u2217 nonAbelian gauge theories. For instance, the curvature tensor for the Abelian gauge theory\nis derived from F (A) = dA when d directly operates on the one-form A. This is not the\ncase with the non-Abelian gauge theory where F (N ) = (d + A) \u2227 A. Under the BRST\ntransformations, however, the kinetic energy terms for Abelian- and non-Abelian gauge\n(A)\na(N )\nb(N ) c\ntheories do remain invariant even though \u03b4b F\u03bc\u03bd\n= 0 but \u03b4B F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u03b7gf abc F\u03bc\u03bd\nC . Under\nthe dual BRST symmetries, the gauge-fixing terms of both the theories remain invariant as\nthey are obtained by the application of \u03b4 = \u00b1\u2217d\u2217 operator on the one-form A. The Casimir\noperator generates a symmetry transformation in which ghost fields do not transform and\nA\u03bc gauge field transforms to its own equation of motion in both the cases (cf. (2.4), (3.3)).\nIt is interesting to note that, in the Abelian gauge theory, the requirement that the\ntopological invariants should be related with each-other (Ik \u2192 Jk ) by a Hodge (\u2217) operation, singles out (2.10) from the set of transformations (2.10) and (2.11). On the other\nhand, it can be seen that for the interacting 2D Abelian gauge theory where Abelian gauge\nfield A\u03bc couples with the Dirac fields, it is (2.11) that is singled out for the generalization\nto include matter (Dirac) fields [36] and (2.10) is ruled out for such an important extension.\nFurthermore, it is gratifying to note that certain specific transformation properties of the\ntopological invariants (cf. (2.24), (2.25) (3.24), (3.26)) lead to the derivation of transformations (3.23) for the non-Abelian gauge theory which reduce to the Abelian case (2.10) under\nthe limit g \u2192 0. In fact, it seems to us, the root cause of the lack of a perfect definition of\nHodge (\u2217) operation for the non-Abelian gauge theory, in the language of symmetry prop\u2217\u2217\n\nBesides interaction among themselves, the non-Abelian gauge fields also interact with ghost fields.\nThe latter fields are, however, not the physical matter fields.\n\n15\n\n\ferty, is the difference in the definition of a non-Abelian curvature tensor F (N ) = (d + A) \u2227 A\nfrom that of an Abelian gauge theory where F (A) = dA. The latter is a perfect Hodgeas well as topological field theory. In fact, for the non-Abelian gauge theories, it can be\nseen that the set (d + A, \u03b4, \u2206) does not define the perfect de Rham cohomological operators\nwhereas for the Abelian gauge theory the set (d, \u03b4, \u2206) does define the same.\nIn some of our works [23-25,32] (including the present one), we have carried out investigations in the context of BRST cohomology and HDT in 2D and 4D where spacetime is\nendowed with a flat Minkowski metric. The topological nature emerges due to the fact that\nthere are no propagating degrees of freedom associated with the gauge bosons. It would\nbe an interesting endeavour to consider the interacting gauge theories where matter fields\nare also present. Some steps in this direction [36,37] have already been taken. It appears\nto us, at the moment, that the BRST cohomology and HDT would shed some light on\nthe Adler-Bardeen-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly in 2D where a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the\nconserved current of the Dirac fields. For such an interacting theory, it has been shown that\nthe dual BRST symmetry is connected with the chiral (\u03b35 ) transformation on the matter\n(Dirac) fields [36,37]. It would be nice to generalize this assertion to the non-Abelian gauge\ntheory in 2D where there is an interaction with matter (Dirac) fields.\nThe central outcome of of our studies of the BRST cohomology and HDT should be\ntaken as the proof of the existence of a new class of topological field theories which are\nnothing but the free 2D Abelian- and self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theories. Furthermore, we strongly feel that our studies would shed some light on the consistency and\nunitarity of the anomalous gauge theories in 2D (see, e.g., Refs. [38,39] and references\ntherein). These studies might provide an insight to study thoroughly (3 + 1)-dimensional\nTFTs in the framework of BRST cohomology and HDT which will have something to do\nwith the real spacetime manifolds.\nThe key results in the study of TFTs with a nontrivial spacetime metric has been the\nclassification of 3D and 4D manifolds which have been of importance in the context of\nstring theories [2,4,6,7]. It would be a nice future direction to study 2D and 4D theories\n[23-25,32] with a nontrivial spacetime metric in the framework of BRST cohomology and\nHDT and explore the outcome of such studies. In fact, we guess that the results of earlier\nworks [23-25,32] can be generalized to the case of nontrivial metrics. For this to be true,\none has to show the metric independence of the path integral measure. In Ref. [35], it has\nbeen established that the existence of a BRST type fermionic-bosonic symmetry is good\nenough to prove the metric independence of the measure. It is obvious that, we have such\nkind of BRST- and co-BRST symmetries in our theories. Thus, heuristically, it appears\nto us that the measure will be independent of the choice of the metric for these theories\nas well. After this, it will be straightforward to show that the partition functions as well\nas the expectation values of the BRST-, co-BRST- and topological invariants are metric\nindependent. To demonstrate this, one has to require that: QB |phys >= 0, QD |phys >= 0\n(see, e.g., Ref. [12]). This requirement, very clearly, entails on the physical states of the\n\n16\n\n\ftheory to be the harmonic state of the HDT. These are some of the issues which are under\ninvestigation and our results will be reported elsewhere [40].\n\nReferences\n[1] Schwarz A S 1978 Lett. Math. Phys. 2 247\n[2] Witten E 1982 J. Diff.
