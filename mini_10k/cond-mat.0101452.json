INTRODUCTION\n\nThere are several objects of the quantum mechanics where the investigated system's wave\nfunction is essentially complex(having imaginary part). The examples of these objects are\na two-dimensional system of electrons in the external uniform magnetic field when vector\npotential has a central-symmetric form and system of anyons. The complexity of wave\nfunction does not give a possibility for the simulations of such kind of systems by using\nwell-known Green Function Monte-Carlo method (see review [1]). This method essentially\ndemand the reality of the system's wave function which considered as probability weight in\nduring stochastic process.\nThere had been undertaken the several attempts [2\u20134] for the construction a method for\nthe simulation of quantum systems with complex wave function. Authors of the works [2,6]\nsuggested to take as a probability weight the module of the complex distribution function.\nAll quantities are calculated in [2,6] by averaging over this complex distribution function.\n1\n\n\fThe phase of this function \u03b3 is taken accordingly \u03b3 = \u03b3i , where \u03b3i is the phase at the\ni-time step of the stochastic process.\nAnother quantum Monte Carlo method using algorithm without branching for the simulating of complex problems was developed in [4]. The main trouble of this approach was\nan increasing of the statistical error as a function of the whole time of the simulation.\nIn the previous paper [5] it was suggested new Complex Diffusion Monte-Carlo (CDMC)\nmethod allowing to simulate the quantum systems with complex wave function. Our method\nis rather close to the fixed - phase Diffusion Monte-Carlo method developed for the simulation\nof the two-dimensional electrons in the magnetic field [3]. In this work there had been an\nexact simulation only of the module of system's wave function. The phase of the wave\nfunction was considered as fixed and equal to phase of the Laughlin's wave function [7]. In\ncontrast, our method include also the simulation of the phase factor of the wave function.\nThe basic difficulty of the numerical simulation of the fermions is essentially the same as\nfor the systems with the complex wave function. Their wave function can change the sign\nand therefore can not be used as the probability weight in the simulation process.\nFor the simulation of the continuum (not on the lattice) fermionic systems it were developed widely used fixed node Monte-Carlo method [8]( see also reviews [1,9]) and recently\nproposed constrained path Monte-Carlo method [10]. In these both methods it was assumed\nthe restriction on the random walks connected with the uncertainties in the space localization of the wave function node surfaces. The comparison of these methods was done in\n[11].\nIn the 2D space we have unique tool \u2013 so-called anyons, particles (bosons or fermions)\nwith additional gauge interaction which provide needed statistical properties [12,13]. So, by\ntuning the coupling constant we may arrive to the fermions starting from the bosons. It looks\nvery attractive to apply the anyons for the simulation of the 2D fermions, because statistical\nvector potential that gives anyonic property is relatively smooth and continuous [13,14]. The\nremaining main problem is that the wave function of anyonic system is essentially complex,\ni.e. it contains an imaginary part.\nThe CDMC method was successfully tested by the simulation of ground state of one\nelectron in magnetic field [5]. In the present work we briefly outline the idea of CDMC (the\ndetails of the algorithm one can find in [5]) and provide a further test it by simulating the\nground state of fermions in 2D parabolic well and comparing with well known analytical\nanswer for the ground state energy as a function of the number of fermions. The simulation\nis done for the fermionic systems with the number of particles from two to ten. It was\nfound a good agreement of the numerical results with analytical ones for the numbers of the\nparticles great than four. This observation of the fermionic simulation allows us to hope\nthat the CDMC is a good tool for the simulation of 2D fermion systems.\nP\n\nII.

Hence, a mean quantity < B(t + \u03c4 ) > is determined only by phase \u03b3G of\nrations R\nthe Green function. It is a key conclusion, providing the calculation of mean quantities in\nour CDMC.\nNext, by taking into account the expression for the simulation of the random displacement\nfor the particle ~ri = ~ri \u2032 + D\u03c4 Re~FQ (~ri \u2032 ) + 2(D\u03c4 )1/2 \u03c7 (see [8] and [5]), where \u03c7 is a gaussian\n~ (9) and for A\n~ Q (~ri , ~ri \u2032 ) (12) and\nrandom number, the expressions for F~Q (~ri ) (8), for EL (R)\nalso the expression (14), one can show that at \u03c4 \u2192 0 the phase of the Green function \u03b3G\ntends to zero as \u03c4 1/2 . This property of \u03b3G together with the formula (17) allows CDMC\nsuccessfully simulate all mean quantities.\nThe simulation process starts with mean field approximation of Fetter, Hanna and Laugh~ generated by the average density \u03c1 of the\nlin [15]. In this approximation the mean field A\nparticles:\n~ r ) = \u03c1\u03c0h\u0304\u03bd(~z \u00d7 ~r) = 1 B\n~ \u00d7 ~r.\nA(~\n2\n5\n\n(18)\n\n\f~ = 2\u03c0\u03c1h\u0304\u03bd~z is fictitious uniform mean magnetic field that defines corresponding\nHere B\nq\nmagnetic length aH = h\u0304/B and cyclotron frequency \u03c9c = B/M. Particles move in this\n~ and without 2D parabolic\nmean magnetic field. Energy spectrum of Hamiltonian (1) with A\nwell is Landau levels. We have to simulate anyonic ground state. Therefore we take a wave\nfunction \u03a8\u2217T (~ri ) in the following form:\n\u03a8\u2217T (~ri )\n\n(x2 + y 2)\n(x2 + y 2 )\n= C exp \u2212\u03b1 i 2 i exp \u2212 i 2 i .\n2Ro\n4aH\n!\n\n!\n\n(19)\n\nHere C is a normalization constant, \u03b1 is numerical parameter and Ro = (h\u0304/Mwo )1/2 . In\nthis expression first exponential function with \u03b1 = 1 corresponds to the ground state wave\nfunction of particle in 2D parabolic well and second one to the ground state of Landau\nlevels.\nAverage density of particles \u03c1 is given by \u03c1 = 1/\u03c0ro2 where ro is the mean distance\nbetween particles in system. We assume that ro equals to Ro . The reason of this is that the\ninteraction between two anyons at any non-zero \u03bd has repulsive character and the area Sn\nthat occupied by free particle at n-th 2D oscillator's level is Sn = n\u03c0Ro2 . Last relation for\nSn follows by using virial theorem for the quantum energetic states for the free particle in\n2D parabolic well.\nBy substituting expression B into expression aH q\nand taking account that \u03c1 = 1/\u03c0ro2 , we\nfind the following relation between aH and ro : aH = 1/2\u03bd ro . By similar way one can show\nthat h\u0304\u03c9c /2 = \u03bdh\u0304\u03c9o .\nIt is natural to use h\u0304\u03c9c /2 as energy unit, aH as length unit and 2/h\u0304\u03c9c as time unit \u03c4 . In\nthese units the last term of the Hamiltonian (1) has a coefficient 1/4\u03bd 2 and the argument\nof the first exponential function in (19) has a coefficient \u03b1/4\u03bd. By using above relations\nbetween h\u0304\u03c9c /2 and h\u0304\u03c90 and between aH and r0 it is easily to express the energies in terms\nof 2D oscillator quanta h\u0304\u03c90 and the lengths in terms of r0 .\nIII. DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS\n\nThe simulation of the ground state of the systems of several fermions in 2D parabolic\nwell was performed. By setting the coupling \u03bd = 1 in (2) we get fermions from anyons. This\nvalue of \u03bd is fixed below. As in [8], the total simulation time t is divided into several (in our\ncase we took 40) time blocks \u2206t. In every time block \u2206t initial number of configurations\nNc is chosen equal to 1000 and number of time steps \u03c4 equal to 30.\nWe simulate the energy ESIM , mean radius r and mean square of radius of r 2 of the\nfermionic systems. The calculation of these quantities are performed by the formula (17).\n~ has as a real part ReEL (R),\n~ and also an\nHere we take into account that the energy EL (R)\n~ The number of fermions is varied from two to ten.\nimaginary part ImEL (R).\nThe \u03c4 dependence of the energy ESIM has a general structure A0 + A1 \u03c4 1/2 [8] where A0\nand A1 are the numerical constants.\nWe have obtained that at a very small \u03c4 the mean deviation of ESIM larger than the\nfluctuations of ESIM . At large \u03c4 further increasing of it leads to the increasing of the\nfluctuation of ESIM and thus to the growing of the population number Np (the population\n6\n\n\fnumber Np is connected with first exponential function in (14) and was also introduced in\n[8]). The very large values of \u03c4 give a dramatical increasing of Np that leads to the instability\nof ESIM and whole stochastic process. So, we have to choose optimal time step \u03c40 .\nCDMC [5] has an artifact that the averaged real quantities become complex, but real\nparts of them are essentially bigger than imaginary parts because the imaginary parts are\ncontrolled by the phase of the Green function \u03b3G depending as \u03c400.5 . Then the imaginary\npart of ESIM for almost all number of fermions N is less than 0.15 percent of its real part.\nFor r and r 2 they are less than 0.07 percent of their real parts.\nTable 1 present the exact analytical result for the ground state energy of the fermionic\nsystems in the 2D parabolic well EEXACT , ESIM (in h\u0304\u03c9o units) and the simulated values of r\nand r 2 ( in ro and ro2 units respectively). The values of EEXACT was calculated by occupying\nthe available lowest states. The energy of K-th quantum number state of the 2D oscillator\nis EK = h\u0304\u03c9o (K + 1) and degeneracy number of this state is equal (K + 1) [16].\nESIM is depended on value of numerical parameter \u03b1 in the trial wave function \u03a8\u2217T (~ri )\n(19). We take \u03b1 providing minimal value of the energy ESIM . The numerical data of \u03b1\nthat give a minimal energy ESIM are outlined also in the Table 1. We have compared the\nCDMC dependence of the parameter \u03b1 versus number of particles N with the variational\ncalculation of \u03b1 [17]. If at the changing of N from two to ten CDMC \u03b1 changes from -0.593\nto -0.084, so variational \u03b1 changes from -0.293 to -0.683 (see [17]). For the big number\nfermions (as one can see from table) CDMC \u03b1 is almost the same for all systems. Thus a\nmean field approximation of Fetter, Hanna and Laghlin [15] with numerical parameter in\na wave function can be considered as a good start approximation for the simulation of a\nbig number anyons. Table 1 also shows the numerical values of the population number Np\nand optimal time steps \u03c40 . Good agreement of the simulation results for the ESIM with the\nexact ground state energies EEXACT for the numbers of the particles bigger than four allows\nus to hope that CDMC [5] gives a possibility for the exact simulation of the big number 2D\nfermions.\n\n7\n\n\fTABLES\nTABLE I.
