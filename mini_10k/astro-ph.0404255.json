Observations point towards a \"standard\" \u039bCDM Universe comprised of 28%\ndark matter, 68% dark energy, and luminous baryonic matter (i.e. galaxies, stars, gas, and dust) at a mere 4% (cf.\nSpergel et al. 2003). This so-called \"concordance model\"\ninduces hierarchical structure formation whereby small objects form first and subsequently merge to form progressively larger objects (White & Reese 1978; Davis et al. 1985;\nTormen 1997). The outcome of such mergers, however, depends on many factors (e.g. the mass ratio of the merging halos, their relative velocities, etc.), the result of which\nis a varied mass accretion history for any given host system. While generally successful, the \u039bCDM model does face\nseveral problems, one such problem being the prediction\nthat one-to-two orders of magnitude more satellite galaxies should be orbiting their host halos than are observed\nc 0000 RAS\n\n(Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999). The lack of observational evidence for these satellites has led to the suggestion that they are completely (or almost completely)\ndark, with strongly suppressed star formation due to the\nremoval of gas from the small protogalaxies by the ionising radiation from the first stars and quasars (Bullock\net al. 2000; Tully et al. 2001; Somerville 2002). Others suggest that perhaps low mass satellites never formed in the\npredicted numbers in the first place, indicating problems\nwith the \u039bCDM model in general, replacing it with Warm\nDark Matter instead (Knebe et al. 2002; Bode, Ostriker &\nTurok 2001; Colin et al. 2000). Recent results from (strong)\nlensing statistics suggest that the predicted excess of substructure is in fact required to reconcile some observations\nwith theory (Dahle et al. 2003, Dalal & Kochanek 2002),\nalthough this conclusion has not been universally accepted\n(Sand et al. 2003; Schechter & Wambsganss 2002; Evans &\nWitt 2003). If, however, the lensing detection of halo substructure is correct and the overabundant satellite population really does exist, it is imperative to understand the\n\n\f2\n\nGill et al.\n\norbital evolution of these objects and their deviation from\nthe background dark matter distribution.\nThe work described here focuses upon a set of numerical\nsimulations of structure formation within the concordance\nmodel, analysing in detail the temporal and spatial properties of satellite galaxies residing within host dark matter\nhalos. To date, typical satellite properties such as orbital parameters and mass loss under the influence of the host halo\nhave primarily been investigated using static potentials for\nthe dark matter host halo (e.g. Johnston et al. 1996; Hayashi\net al. 2003). We stress that each of these studies have provided invaluable insights into the physical processes involved\nin satellite disruption; our goals was to augment these studies by relaxing the assumption of a static host potential,\nin deference to the fact that realistic dark matter halos\nare not necessarily axis-symmetric. Halos constantly grow\nin mass through slow accretion and violent mergers, possessing rather triaxial shapes (Warren et al. 1992). While\na self-consistent cosmological modeling of both hosts and\nsatellites has long been recognised as optimal, the required\nmass and force resolution can be difficult to accommodate\n(hence the use of static host potentials in most previous\nstudies).\nThe first fully self-consistent simulations targeting\nthe subject were performed by Tormen (1997) and Tormen et al. (1998). Both studies were landmark efforts, but\nlacked the temporal, spatial, and mass resolution necessary\nto explore a wide range of environmental effects. Unable to\nfollow the satellite distribution within the host's virial radius, satellites were instead tracked only up to and including the point of \"accretion\". This allowed an analysis of the\ninfall pattern, rather than the orbital evolution of the satellites. Ghigna et al. (1998) also investigated the dynamics of\nsatellite galaxies in live dark matter host halos. Although\ngreatly increasing the mass and spatial resolution, they still\nlacked the temporal resolution to explicitly track the satellite orbits. Instead, the orbits were approximated using a\nspherical static potential. More recently, Taffoni et al. (2003)\nused N -body simulations coupled with semi-analytical tools\nto explore the evolution of dark matter satellites inside more\nmassive halos. However, they focus their efforts on the interplay between dynamical friction and tidal mass loss in determining the final fate of the satellites. Kravtsov et al. (2004)\nalso mainly concentrate on the mass loss history of satellites\nusing fully self-consistent cosmological N -body simulations.\nIn this paper we investigate the evolution of substructure and the orbital parameters of satellites using high spatial, mass, and temporal resolution. As outlined in Paper I\n(Gill, Knebe & Gibson 2004; hereafter GKGI), our suite of\nsimulations has the required resolution to follow the satellites even within the very central regions of the host potential (\u22655\u201310% of the virial radius) and the time resolution to resolve the satellite dynamics with excellent accuracy\n(\u2206t \u2248170 Myrs).\n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides\na description of the cosmological simulations employed. The\nanalysis of the host halo and environment can be found in\nSection 3, with the satellite orbital parameters presented in\nSection 4. We then investigate the kinematic properties of\nthe dark matter halos and satellites in Section 5. We finish\nwith our summary and conclusions in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nSIMULATION DETAILS\n\nOur analysis is based upon a suite of eight high-resolution\nN -body simulations generated using the publicly available\nadaptive mesh refinement code MLAPM (Knebe, Green & Binney 2001). MLAPM reaches high force resolution by refining\nall high-density regions with an automated refinement algorithm. The refinements are recursive: refined regions can also\nbe refined, each subsequent grid level having cells that are\nhalf the size of the cells in the previous level. This creates a\nhierarchy of refinement meshes of different resolutions covering regions of interest. The refinement is done cell-by-cell\n(individual cells can be refined or de-refined) and meshes are\nnot constrained to have a rectangular (or any other) shape.\nThe criterion for (de-)refining a cell is simply the number of\nparticles within that cell. A detailed study of the appropriate choice for this number as well as more details about the\nparticulars of the code can be found in Knebe et al. (2001).\nThe force resolution is determined by the finest refinement level reached and corresponds to \u22482h\u22121 kpc for the\nsimulations presented here. The mass of an individual lowmass particle is mp = 1.6 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 and the halos are\nresolved with on the order of millions of these particles. In\norder to investigate the evolution of satellite galaxies and\ntheir debris high temporal sampling of the outputs was necessary. From z = 2.5 to z = 0.5 we have 17 equally spaced\noutputs with \u2206t \u2248 0.35Gyrs. From z = 0.5 to z = 0 we have\n30 outputs spaced at \u2206t \u2248 0.17Gyrs. For further details\nplease refer to GKGI.\nFor each of our 376 outputs the satellite galaxies were\ninitially located using MLAPM-Halo-Finder (MHF) (GKGI). This\nprovided us with a list of all satellites and their internal\nproperties at each individual redshift under consideration.\nHowever, as we are more interested in orbital information\nwe performed a detailed time analysis of those satellites that\nwere within two times the virial radius of the host halo at\nits formation time (using MLAPM-Halo-Tracker: MHT). For a\ndetailed description of the halo finders and their effectiveness\nwe refer the reader to GKGI.\n\n3\n\nHOST HALOS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn Table 1 we summarise the relevant characteristics of the\neight host halos. The derivation of these properties is detailed in Sections 3.1-3.4.\nquantities presented discussed in this Section.\n\n3.1\n\nCanonical Properties\n\nA simple MHF analysis of the simulation at redshift z = 0\nprovides us with the relevant information for the host halo.\nAt z = 0 the halo masses range from 1\u20133 \u00d71014 h\u22121 M\u2299\nwhere mass here was defined to be that within the virial radius Rvir . The virial radii in turn at which defined to be the\npoint where the mean averaged density of the host (measured in terms of the cosmological background density \u03c1b )\ndrops below \u2206vir = 340 with Mvir being the mass enclosed\nby that sphere. The formation redshift zform is defined here\nas the redshift where the halo contains half of its present\nday mass (Lacey & Cole 1994).

In other words, while the masses of\nour systems are comparable, they are dynamically different.\nIn Table 1, as in all following figures, the halos are ordered\n1-8 in age.\nThe appropriate coordinate system to investigate the\norbits of the satellite galaxies is given by the eigenvectors\n~ 1,2,3 (with E\n~ 1 being the major axis) of the inertia tenE\nsor of the respective host halo. Moreover, the eigenvalues\na > b > c can be used to describe the shape of the host and\ndefine its triaxiality T = (a2 \u2212 b2 )/(a2 \u2212 c2 ) (Franx, Illingworth & Zeeuw 1991). The calculation of the inertia tensor\nis based upon the \"core\" region of the host as defined by\nthe 6th refinement level in MLAPM; i.e. the boundary of this\nrefinement level is an isodensity contour. The 6th refinement\nlevel surrounds material about 3000 times denser than \u03c1b ,\nor 9 times denser than the material at the virial radius.\nThe density profiles of our host halos are well described - at\nleast in the range from 6h\u22121 kpc out to the virial radius - by\nthe functional form advocated by Navarro, Frenk & White\n(1997) with concentration in the range c \u2248 4 \u2212 9. Therefore,\na density of roughly 9 \u00d7 \u03c1(Rvir ) corresponds to about the\nhalf-mass radius of the host.\n\n3.2\n\nFormation History\n\nAs we are interested in investigating the influence of host\nhalo formation history and environment on the orbital and\ninternal properties of the satellites galaxies living within its\nvirial radius, it is important to understand how the host\nhalos actually formed.\nAs indicated by Tormen (1997) the formation of dark\nmatter halos can be characterised by two different phases:\none corresponding to a rapid increase in halo mass, representative of a major merger. We refer to this phase as a\nviolent (V) period. The second phase is one of relaxation\nin which the halo processes the merger and settles toward\nvirial equilibrium. A halo may continue to accrete smaller\nhalos during this phase. We refer to this phase as a quiet\n(Q) period.\nThe history of each halo is briefly outlined below using the simplified keys V or Q to signify violent or quiet\nepisodes. For example, halo #1 has a history \"QVQQ\", that\nis, a quiet period around the time of formation zform followed\nby a violent period of merging of about the same length and\ncompleted by quiet evolution for the remainder of the evolution, which lasts for twice as long as either of the two earlier\nepisodes. The coding chain splits the evolution since formation up into more-or-less equal segments, but has nothing\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nto say about the absolute timescales, which differ widely\nfrom halo to halo. A qualitative summary of the eight halos\nfollows:\nHalo #1 (QVQQ)\nA reasonably quiet history with no major violent encounters,\nsave for a medium one at z = 0.7.\nHalo #2 (QVQQ)\nA generally quiet history with a medium size merger one\nquarter of the way through its evolution at z = 0.53, quickly\nsettling for the rest of its formation.\nHalo #3 (QVVVQ)\nAn initial short quiet period followed by a long and violent\ninteraction that takes essentially the rest of its formation\ntime to settle.\nHalo #4 (VQQ)\nAn initially violent merger which quickly settles for the rest\nof its formation.\nHalo #5 (V)\nA very violent formation history with a strongly oscillating\npotential.\nHalo #6 (V)\nA steady, yet violent, formation history.\nHalo #7 (V)\nA formation history quite similar to that of halo #6.\nHalo #8 (V)\nA rapid formation history; constantly interacting with two\nother large halos. In this sense, a unique system.\nWhile useful, such a qualitative description needs to be\naugmented with a quantitative one. In order to do so, we\nuse the dispersion of the rate of relative mass change of the\nhost halos:\n2\n\u03c3\u2206M/M\n=\n\nNout \u0010\n\u00112\n1 X \u2206Mi\n\u2206M\n,\n\u2212h\nii\nNout\n\u2206ti Mi\n\u2206tM\n\n(1)\n\ni=2\n\nwhere Nout is the number of available outputs from formation zform to redshift z = 0, \u2206Mi = M (zi ) \u2212 M (zi\u22121 ) the\nchange in the mass of the host halo, and \u2206ti the respective\nchange in time. The mean growth rate at time i\nh\n\nNi \u0010\n\u0011\n\u2206M\n1 X \u2206Mi\nii =\n\u2206tM\nNi\n\u2206ti Mi j\n\n(2)\n\nj=1\n\nis calculated for each individual output as the average over\nall halos Ni available at that time step.\nA large dispersion \u03c3\u2206M/M now indicates a violent formation history whereas low values correspond to quiescent\nformation histories. As we can see in Table 1, our qualitative\nclassification scheme is confirmed by the \u03c3\u2206M/M values.\n\n\f4\n\nGill et al.\n\nFigure 1. Mass locked-up in satellites within the virial radius\ndivided by the virial mass of the host halo as a function of redshift.\n\n3.3\n\nSatellite Mass History\n\nTo gain further insight into the hierarchical build-up of the\nhost and the evolution of its satellite population we plot the\nfraction of its mass locked up in the satellite distribution in\nFigure 1. We show the total mass of all the satellites (identified by the MHT method outlined in GKGI) living within\nthe virial radius divided by the mass of the host halo as a\nfunction of redshift.\nAt z = 0 the average mass of all substructure is approximately 8\u20139% of the host halo's virial mass with the scatter\nallowing for as much as 15% and as little as 3%. We do not\nobserve any pronounced trend for this fraction to depend\non the age of the dark matter halo, which is consistent with\nthe hierarchical model of satellite accretion: both small and\nlarge objects continuously fall in. The history is clearly reflected in Figure 1, where the infall of large satellites gives\nrise to the spiky nature of the curves. These large variations\nare, however, a combination of massive halos merging via\ndynamical friction and \"transitory structures\". Transitory\nstructures are small subsets of satellites that interact with a\nhalo, but are not bound to it. An example is given in Figure 2\nwhere we show one of these transitory events for halo #7.\nThe peak near redshift z = 0.2 for this halo in Figure 1\nis caused by an object of roughly 10% of the mass of the\nhost orbiting in the outskirts (but still within Rvir ) of the\nhost halo at a relative speed of approximately 750 km s\u22121 .\nFigure 2 captures this event showing the host and its virial\nradius at redshift z = 0 with the path of the satellite indicated by a line. The perturber itself is represented by its\nparticles. Its tidal disruption while passing near the host\ncan also be appreciated in Figure 2. We particularly highlight this galactic encounter not only to explain the rise in\nFigure 1 but also to raise the readers attention to the potential of already \"harassed\" galaxies falling into the host\nhalo. The large peak for halo #8 in Figure 1 is due to an\ninteraction with one of the other two large objects in the\nsystem. The violent history of halos #5 and #6 can also be\nseen in Figure 1. The more quiescent halos also stand out in\n\nFigure 2. This figure shows a satellite of mass 10% the host\nhalo that is responsible for the jump in the host's mass accretion\nhistory. The host halo (halo # 7) is plotted as a line of sight\ndensity projection using every 3rd particle, whereas the satellite\nis represented by all its particles without a density map. The\nsatellite enters the halo at z = 0.25 (lower right) and leaves again\naround z = 0 with the thin line indicating its orbit. The sphere\nshows the virial radius of the halo at z = 0 and the relative\nvelocities of the two objects is 750 km s\u22121 .\n\nthis figure, with less variation in the substructure evolution\nexcept for halo #2 with a 15% mass merger at z = 0.53.\nIn summary, we have selected a sample of halos displaying widely different formation histories, which should aid in\ngaining insight into the environmental effects of halo formation.\n\n3.4\n\nThe Supply of Satellites\n\nWe now investigate the temporal evolution of satellite accretion and tidal disruption as a function of host halo environment and richness.\nIn Figure 3 we display the normalised number of satellites within the respective host halo as a function of time\nafter the initial formation epoch. As we intend to measure\n\"supply rates\" rather than absolute numbers of infalling\nsatellites we normalise the curves by the number of satellites present at the formation time of the host halo. The\nthin line represents the total normalised number of satellites which have been accreted, while the thick line refers\nto the number of surviving satellites. The criterion used to\ndefine tidal disruption is the reduction in the number of particles within a given satellite's tidal radius to fewer than 15.\nThis definition is somewhat arbitrary, although ultimately\nbased upon the numerical resolution. For a more detailed\ndiscussion please refer to GKGI.\nThe increase in the total number of satellites (thin\ncurve) reflects the \"richness\" of the environment around the\nhalo: halos with a steep slope benefit from a constant supply of satellite galaxies wheres hosts that only show a mild\nincrease draw upon a pool of fewer satellites in their immediate vicinity. This is illustrated by the case of halo #1\nwhich lies in a particularly rich environment in which several\nfilaments intersect (cf. Figure 4 below). As a consequence,\nit accretes a total of nearly five times the initial number of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fLinking satellite dynamics to environment\n\n5\n\nsatellites while simultaneously showing a high satellite disruption rate. The case of halo #3 is similar, but less extreme.\nHalos #7 and #8, by contrast, experience only moderate infall, and in these halos nearly all the satellites survive. The\nsituation is illustrated for halos #1 and #8 in Figure 4,\nwhich shows the orbital paths followed by all the satellites\nfrom the formation epoch up to the present day. In the upper panel we clearly see the filament arms that feed halo #1\nand how the satellites spiral into the dark matter halo. The\nfilaments are helical because they consist of smaller satellites orbiting a larger host that is falling into the massive\nhost halo. The small but rapid rise in the satellite infall for\nhalo #1 (Figure 3) is caused by a group of satellites falling\ninto the halo for the first time. In the bottom panel of Figure 4 we feature halo #8; in contrast to halo #1, halo #8\nwas formed in a relatively isolated region which saw a rapid\ncollapse. We can, however, confirm that even though the\nsatellite accretion rate in halo #8 is far less the mass of the\ninfalling objects is much higher. This is derived from the\nfact that halo #8 acquires half its mass by digesting those\nfew satellites in a time span of approximately 3 Gyrs (cf.\nFigure 1). We note though that there also exists a significant age difference between halo #1 and #8; this explains\nwhy halo #8 satellites are traced for a shorter time leading\nto the \"shorter\" lines in Figure 4. However, there still exist noticeable differences in the satellite accretion curves for\nhalos #1 and #8 (cf. Figure 3) when restricting halo #1 to\nthe first 3.5 Gyrs of its existence.\nWe define the substructure \"richness\" as the ratio of\nthe final to initial number of satellites, and list its value for\neach of the eight halos in Table 1.\nThe number of surviving satellites is not directly correlated with the richness, but rather to the orbital characteristics of the accreted satellites, as we will demonstrate\nin detail below. In general, the accreted satellites are not\nimmediately disrupted, but are progressively destroyed over\ntime.\nTo further investigate the link between satellite disruption and satellite infall we calculate the ratio of disrupted (or\n\"dead\") satellites to the total number of satellites that fall\ninto the host halo. The result is presented in Figure 5. It is\nnow possible to interpret the slope of this figure as the \"rate\nof disruption\" of satellite galaxies. For all halos this disruption rate (i.e. slope) is very similar. There seems to be no\nstrongly pronounced correlation with either mass, environment or age. In this respect, the destruction rate of satellite\ngalaxies appears to be \"common\" in CDM halos. However,\nthere also appears to be a (marginal) trend that host mass is\nrelated to the ability to disrupt satellites (within the limited\nmass range presented here). This can be seen explicitly for\nhalos #1 and #3: #1 destroys its satellites more efficiently\nthan #3 and is also the more massive of the two. However,\nthese halos also have a large difference in triaxiality (refer to\nTable 1). Conversely, as halo #3 is comparable in mass to\nhalo #4 with a strikingly similar satellite destruction rate.\nBut as halo #3 and #4 are close in triaxiality, we rather\nsuspect the disruption rate to correlate with mass than with\ntriaxiality. However, this correlation - if in fact correct - must\nalso have significant scatter, as the most massive halo (#8)\nshows the lowest destruction rate. This might be linked to\nthe environment and supply of new satellites, respectively.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 3. Number of satellites within the virial radius of their\nrespective host as a function of redshift. The thin line is the total\nnumber of satellites that have fallen into the host whereas the\nthick line shows the number of surviving satellites. Both lines are\nnormalised to the total number of satellites at zform .\n\n3.5\n\nSummary of Host Halos and Satellite Supply\n\nTable 1 summarises the basic properties of our halos and\ntheir environments, illustrating the variety of richness and\naccretion histories sampled by our simulations. The mass\nspectra of the satellite galaxies (although not presented)\nare consistent with other studies in the literature, being\ndescribed by a declining power-law dn/dM \u221d M \u2212\u03b1 with\n\u03b1 \u2248 1.7 \u2212 1.9 (cf. Ghigna et al. 2000) in the range from\n2\u00d71010 h\u22121 M\u2299 (applied mass-cut corresponding to 100 particles, which explains the rather 'low' number for Nsat (<\nRvir ) in Table 1) up to \u223c 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 . However, the number of satellites changes, because a) new ones are constantly\nbeing accreted (cf. thin lines in Figure 3) and b) they are\nbeing concurrently disrupted (cf. Figure 5). We also observe\nthat the destruction rate is nearly identical for all our host\nhalos, making it (nearly) independent of mass, age, and triaxiality. Further, as seen in Figure 4 satellites do not fall in\nisotropically (Knebe et al. 2004). Instead they are accreted\nvia large-scale filamentary structure, with some carried in\nby more massive satellites with their own substructure field,\nconfirming the results from earlier lower resolution simula-\n\n\f6\n\nGill et al.\n\nFigure 5.

The orbits of all objects in the vicinity of the host\nhalo are shown as lines that graduate from dark at zform to light\nz = 0. The black spheres have a 2h\u22121 Mpc radius. The top panel\nshows the \"rich environment\" of halo #1, the bottom panel the\nmore isolated region halo #8. While satellites continually infall\ninto halo #1, halo #8 saw an early, rapid infall of essentially all\nits associated satellite substructure.\n\ntions (Hatton & Ninin 2001; Colberg et al. 1999; Tormen\n1997)\n\n4\n\nORBITAL PARAMETER STATISTICS\n\nHaving described the differences in the host halos, we now\nturn to the detailed analysis of the evolution of satellite\ngalaxies. In the following subsections we investigate their\nlifetimes, orbital parameters, and derive relevant correlations and relations.\n\n4.1\n\nNumber of Satellite Orbits\n\nIn Figure 6 we show the distribution of the number of orbits\nfor both surviving satellites (thick lines) and disrupted satellites (thin lines) at redshift z = 0. For the determination and\ndefinition of the number of orbits refer to GKGI.\n\nFigure 6. The thick histograms show the distribution of the number of orbits for all satellites that survive until redshift z = 0. The\nthin histograms show the distribution for disrupted satellites.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fLinking satellite dynamics to environment\nFor the satellites that survived until z = 0 the distribution peaks at or near one orbit for each of the eight host\nhalos. More than 70% of the satellites have had at least one\nfull orbit with some having as many as four, therefore making a study of the satellite dynamics valid. The length of\nthe tail to the right of the peak at one orbit is somewhat\ncorrelated with the age of the dark matter halo. Further,\nthe peak is more pronounced in the younger halos. However, halos #1 and #3 both show distinctive peaks at one\norbit which relates to the richness of environment given in\nTable 1, rather than the age, as satellites are continuously\nfalling in.\nThe interpretation of the distribution for the disrupted\nsatellites is more interesting. We note that these orbits are\ndetermined by mass-less tracer particles placed at the last\ncredible centre of the satellite before disruption. For our\ndefinition of \"disruption\" please refer to GKGI. The distributions are generally \"flatter\" with the most prominent\npeak near zero orbits. One explanation for such a distribution is that the infalling satellites are being disrupted before completing one orbit. This suggests that satellites contributing to this bin in the distribution are very massive and\nrapidly decay via dynamical friction. Having said that, we\nemphasize that this interpretation may be somewhat simplistic. All satellites were identified at zform and we do not\nhave an indication as to how long the satellites had already\nexisted within the host's progenitor. Therefore, (massive)\nsatellites that had already been orbiting within the progenitor would be the first to be disrupted, giving this biased\nresult. Another small contribution to this bin is from the\nsub-substructure. As seen in Figure 4 the systems of substructure are spiraling into the dark matter halo, thus the\nsub-structure is being destroyed in its very own (sub-)host\nbefore completing a full orbit. Regardless of this \"zero orbit\"\npeak, most of the disrupted satellites complete at least the\nsame number of orbits as the ones which survive to z = 0.\n\n4.2\n\nOrbital Eccentricity and Pericentres\n\nAs outlined in GKGI, we define eccentricity as\np\ne=1\u2212 ,\na\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the pericentre p and apocentre a distances were those\nlast measured in the satellite's (or the tracer particle's) orbit.\nUsing this definition we show in Figure 7 the distribution\nof the orbital eccentricity e for both live (thick lines) and\ndisrupted satellites (thin lines). Further, we fit a Gaussian\nP (e) = \u221a\n\n1\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n(e\u2212e0 )2\n2\u03c32\n\n(4)\n\nto the distributions (solid curves for live and dashed lines\nfor disrupted satellites). From this fit the peak orbital eccentricity for the eight halos has an average of he0 i = 0.61\nwith an average standard deviation of h\u03c3i = 0.19. We do not\nobserve again any correlation of peak position and width of\nthe distribution with environment, age, host history or richness, even though \u03c3 appears to be larger for the younger\ndark matter halos. It is interesting to note that if we stack\nthe data from the eight halos together and then separate\nthe satellite population into differing mass bins we see little\nvariation. This common behaviour still holds and probably\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n7\n\nFigure 7. The orbital eccentricity distribution function presented\nas histograms for all satellites that survived until redshift z = 0\n(thick lines) and those which were destroyed (thin lines). The\ncurves represent best-fit Gaussians to the distributions.\n\nreflects the scale free force of gravity and hierarchical construction. The disrupted satellites, however, have a different distribution, almost mirroring the survivors about the\ne = 0.5-axes, with the peak eccentricity near hed0 i = 0.34\nand a dispersion of h\u03c3 d i = 0.16. Thus, the destroyed satellites were preferentially on more circular orbits.\nThe pericentre distributions provide additional insight\ninto the nature of the orbits of the disrupted satellites. The\nresult for redshift z = 0 can be seen in Figure 8 where p\nhas been normalised by the virial radius of the host. Again,\nlive satellites are represented as thick lines and disrupted\nones as thin lines. A striking characteristic of these distributions is again the similarity between the halos. Moreover,\nwe also observe a similarity in the distribution for the live\nand disrupted satellites. This is emphasised particularly by\nthe best-fit Gaussians to the distributions. The maximum\npeak lies at 35% of the virial radius for live satellites with a\nmean dispersion of h\u03c3i = 0.12 as opposed to 31% of Rvir for\nthe disrupted ones with a dispersion of h\u03c3 d i = 0.11. Unlike\neccentricity, the pericentre distribution rises quickly towards\nthe peak and falls off moderately to the outer parts of the\nhost halo. We already noted the lack of correlation with\nmass, age, environment and richness, but there is, however,\na mild dependence on the state (live or dead) of the satellite\n\n\f8\n\nGill et al.\n\nFigure 8. The pericentre distribution function presented as histograms for all satellites that survived until redshift z = 0 (thick\nlines) and those which were destroyed (thin lines). The curves\nrepresent best-fit Gaussians to the distributions.\n\nFigure 9. We plot the satellite eccentricity against pericentre\nnormalised by the virial radius of the host. The crosses represent the satellites that survived until z = 0 while the diamonds\nrepresent the disrupted satellites.\n\nas disrupted satellites appear to have had marginally nearer\nexcursions towards the host centre. When we stack the data\nfrom the eight halos and separate into differing satellite mass\nbins we again see little variation.\nIn summary the difference between live and disrupted\nsatellites lies primarily in the eccentricity distribution. Disrupted satellites seem to be on more circular orbits. Since the\ndisrupted satellites have similar pericentres to those which\nsurvive their circular nature means that they spend more\ntime in the deeper regions of the potential well. Hence, they\nexperience stronger tidal forces for longer periods, and are\nthus disrupted/dissolved more readily.\nWe close this subsection with an examination of the\npericentre-eccentricity relation (Figure 9). The crosses represent the satellites that survived until redshift z = 0, while\nthe diamonds represent the disrupted satellites. Although\nmany of the features seen here are also seen in Figure 7\nand Figure 8, there are two additional ones which we will\ncomment on now.\nOne such feature is the bimodality in the satellite distribution of halo # 1. In this Figure there seems to be two\ndistinct (live and dead) satellite populations orbiting within\nthe dark matter halo. As we saw, particularly in Figure 4,\nthis dark matter halo lies in a rich area being fed by (at\n\nleast) two filaments. Perhaps these two satellite populations\nare a remnant of the filamentary large-scale structure surrounding the host? If that is true, it is interesting that the\nsatellites still maintain their dynamical distinctiveness after\nseveral orbits.\nIn addition there appears to be a distinct population of\nsatellites with an extremely tight (anti-)correlation between\neccentricities e \u2248 0.6 \u2212 0.9 and pericentres p \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.8\nin many halos. Upon detailed investigation these satellites\nwere identified to have completed one orbit and were entering the halo for the first time. This is consistent with the\nnotion of the satellites infalling on radial orbits. We investigate this point in the next section, namely the evolution of\neccentricity.\n4.3\n\nEvolution of Eccentricity\n\nIn the previous section we considered the orbital characteristics of the satellites at redshift z = 0. We now investigate the\nevolution of the orbital eccentricities of the satellite family.\nFigure 10 shows the eccentricity of each satellite (represented by the crosses) versus the number of orbits the satellite has completed. There is a clear trend for eccentricity\nto decrease as the number of orbits of a satellite increases.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fLinking satellite dynamics to environment\n\nFigure 10. The final orbital eccentricity plotted against the number of orbits completed for each surviving satellite (crosses). The\nhistogram shows the averaged eccentricity (see text for details).\n\nThis is also demonstrated by the histogram, which is not\nthe \"binned\" results of the crosses, but is instead the average eccentricity for all satellites that had \u2265 Norbits orbits\nhei(Norbits ) =\n\n1\nNsat (\u2265 Norbits )\n\nNsat (\u2265Norbits )\n\nX\n\nei (Norbits ) . (5)\n\ni=1\n\nHere, ei (Norbits ) is the eccentricity of satellite i after Norbits\norbits and Nsat (\u2265 Norbits ) is the number of satellites with\nequal or more than Norbits orbits.\nFor example, a satellite that has had 3 orbits contributes\nits respective value of eccentricity to the average eccentricity in the bins for 1, 2, and 3 orbits. This histogram shows\na trend indicative of orbit circularisation with time. Before\nthe work of Hashimoto et al. (2002) one would have been\nquick to interpret this result as dynamical friction circularising the orbits, however, they suggested otherwise. To confirm this, we selected the satellites at differing pericentre,\nas dynamical friction is proportional to the local density of\nthe background field, and thus has it's strongest influence at\npericentre. Having done this, we saw no significant change\nin the above trend. Further, when we used the analytical\npredictions of Taffoni et al. (2003) we found that very few\nsatellites in the population presented could be affected by\ndynamical friction. Therefore, we do not attribute the circuc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n9\n\nlarising of the orbits to dynamical friction. One mechanism\nwhich could be responsible for the circularising of the orbits\nis the secular growth in the host halo's mass. In response\nto this increase in host mass the velocity and hence the orbit of the satellite changes. Further we suggest that this\nchange acts to circularise the orbit. Within the context of a\nfully self-consistent N -body simulation this claim is difficult\nto verify. However, in Section 5 we show that a clear relationship exists between satellite velocity dispersion and host\nhalo mass, implying that the satellite velocities respond to\na change in host mass.\nFinally we compare our orbital parameters to those presented by Ghigna et al. (1998). The major difference between\nour respective analysis in the derivation of the orbital characteristics is that even though their host halos and satellite galaxies formed fully self-consistently in cosmological\nsimulations they took the satellite positions and velocities\nand evolved them in a static spherical potential in order to\nobtain orbital characteristics. Ghigna et al. found that the\nsatellites on radial orbits were more likely to be disrupted\nthan those on circular orbits because they penetrate further\ninto the dark matter halo potential well. In addition, radial\norbits were quite common and circular orbits quite rare in\ntheir simulations. The average ratio of apocentre:pericentre\nin their outputs was 6:1, with nearly 25% of the halos on\norbits with ratios in excess of 10:1. In our language this\n6:1 ratio equates to an eccentricity of \u223c 0.83. Hence, the\nGhigna et al. satellite orbits were considerably more radial\nthan ours. We can not reconcile this discrepancy through dynamical friction arguments. However, it could potentially be\nexplained by the lack of a live halo. This explanation correlates with our previous finding in Section 4 for a recently infalling satellite population. This latter population constitute\na distinct subpopulation with a strong (anti-)correlation in\nFigure 9 and an average eccentricity of \u223c 0.8, quite similar\nto the result of Ghigna et al. .\n\n4.4\n\nCircularity of Orbits\n\nAnother way to measure the circularity of the orbits can be\nwritten\n\u03bb=\n\nJsat(E)\nJcirc(E)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the ratio between the actual angular momentum\nof the satellite Jsat and the angular momentum of a circular\norbit Jcirc with the same energy E.\nThe correlation of \u03bb with the the orbital eccentricity\ndefined in Eq. (3) is presented in Figure 11 for all satellites\nthat had at least one full orbit at redshift z = 0. The solid\nlines are upper limits given by the assumption that both\nsatellite and host halo are point masses. For a derivation of\nthis relation please refer to the Appendix.\nWe observe that most of the satellites follow the trend\nindicated by the analytical estimate showing that loweccentricity satellites are in fact on more circular orbits.\nHowever, the trend is only suggestive but not strong with a\nsignificant scatter making it difficult to substitute one measure for the other.\n\n\f10\n\nGill et al.\n\nFigure 11.

Only\nsatellites with at least one full orbit are considered and the solid\nline marks the 1:1 correlation.\n\n5\n\nDARK MATTER AND SATELLITE\nKINEMATICS\n\nA controversy still exists as to whether or not cluster members trace the dark matter velocity distribution. Colin,\nKlypin & Kravtsov (2000) found a substantial positive velocity bias when calculating the local (or one-point) velocity\nbias\nbv (r) =\n\n\u03c3v,sat (r)\n.\n\u03c3v,DM (r)\n\n(7)\n\nA similar yet less pronounced signal was reported by\nOkamoto & Habe (1999), whereas Ghigna et al. (1998) did\nnot find any significant velocity bias in their analysis of cluster substructure. Ghigna et al. (2000) re-visited this issue,\nobtaining a small positive bias, but much weaker than that\nreported by Colin et al. (1999). Springel et al. (2001) also\nexamined this question, suggesting a small anti-bias from\ntheir cluster simulations.\nWe now attempt to shed light on this controversy,\nby comparing the kinematical properties of the host halo\nand the satellite populations. We first look at the threedimensional velocity dispersion normalised by the maximum\ncircular velocity of the host as a function of (normalised)\nhalo centric distance. The results for all eight host halos\nis presented in Figure 12. The dark matter distribution of\n\nFigure 12. The normalised three dimensional velocity dispersion\nas a function of halo-centric distance normalised by the maximum\ncircular velocity of the host halo. The dark lines represents the\ndark matter distribution, while the light line is the satellite distribution.\n\nthe halo is represented by the thick histograms while curves\nbased upon the satellite galaxy population are plotted as\nthin histograms. Note that we do not see the characteristic \"rise and fall\" for the velocity dispersion of a Navarro,\nFrenk & White (1997) profile (cf. Lokas & Mamon 2001),\nbecause for the host halos under consideration \u03c3v peaks at\nabout 10% of Rvir , which is where we start to plot the data.\nIn general though, from the inner bin at 10% of Rvir out to\nRvir we see a drop in the dark matter's three-dimensional velocity dispersion. This drop is even more pronounced for the\nsatellite population. Thus in general for each halo we see an\nincreasing satellite \"local velocity bias\" as we get closer to\nthe center of the host halo. In the outer regions we have bv (\u2264\nRvir ) \u223c 1.0 while in the inner regions bv (\u2265 0.1Rvir ) varies\nfrom 1.1 \u2212 1.4 with the largest value for bv being recorded\nfor halo #2, bv (\u2248 0.1Rvir ) \u223c 1.4. Essentially for all halos\nthough bv (r) \u2265 1.0 at all radii. This result agrees with the\ndata shown by Colin et al. (1999) and Ghigna et al. (2000),\nin which both groups found that the satellite population is\n\"positively\" biased with bv (\u2248 0.1Rvir ) \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.3. However,\nit contrasts with the Springel et al. (2001) findings in which\na small negative velocity bias for the central regions of the\ncluster was claimed.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fLinking satellite dynamics to environment\n\n11\n\nTable 2.

Figure 7) and the bias seen in Figure 12; however, there is sufficient orbital distribution variation to accommodate for the variation in the bias. Improved\nstatistics will be needed to decouple the detailed variations.\nHowever, we have shown that the velocity bias has the same\nbasic shape for all eight halos, strengthening the case that\nthis is a general characteristic of the satellite population.\nUsing all the dark matter particles and satellite galaxies\nwithin the virial radius we also calculate the global velocity\nbias\n\u03c3v,sat (< Rvir )\n(8)\nbv,global =\n\u03c3v,DM (< Rvir )\nwhich is summarized for all eight halos in Table 2. It is interesting to note that we find a slight positive bias, even\nthough Klypin et al. (1999) and Ghigna et al. (1998) both\nclaimed that such a global velocity bias should not exist.\nHowever, Klypin et al. (1999) did hint that the possibility\nof a mild negative bias might exist, based upon earlier theoretical work by Carlberg (1994). Carlberg argued that as\ngalaxies fall into the cluster for the first time they lose energy to the cluster and become systematically more bound,\norbiting freely as coherent, self-gravitating units. From his\nsimulation he measured a value of bv,global \u223c 0.8 \u00b1 0.1.\nFrom our halos we find an average global velocity bias\nhbv,global i \u223c 1.103 \u00b1 0.002, which is only a very slight bias.\nIf we restrict the global velocity bias calculation to satellites\nNorbits \u22651\nthat have had at least one orbit, hbv,global\ni \u223c 1.019\u00b10.002,\na 7% decrease in the bias. The quoted errors are the scatter\nwithin the eight halos.\nTo further investigate the velocity bias we measure the\nvariation from an isotropic velocity distribution using the\nanisotropy parameter, as seen in Figure 13\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03c3t2 /2\u03c3r2 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c3t measures the variance in the tangential and \u03c3r\nin radial direction. Once again, the dark matter (\u03b2DM ) and\nsatellite distribution (\u03b2sat ) were averaged in linearly spaced\nradial bins, normalised by the virial radius. The dark matter distribution is represented by the thick histogram and\nthe satellite galaxies by the thin histogram. For an isotropic\ndistribution \u03b2 = 0; if \u03b2 \u2192 1, then the velocities are preferentially radial; if \u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, they are preferentially tangential.\nThe standard way to represent \u03b2 is on a logarithm scale\nstarting from the inner percent of the virial radius. Cole &\nLacey (1996) and Thomas et al. (1998) employed this technique and measured a linear increase in \u03b2DM , starting with\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 13. The velocity anisotropy parameter as a function of\nhalocentric distance. The thick line represents the dark matter\ndistribution, while the thin line is the satellite distribution. The\nquantities were calculated in linear radial bins.\n\nessentially isotropic orbits close to the halo core and becoming increasingly radial in the outer regions. In keeping\nwith previous figures we plot the data on a linear scale.\nThis makes it difficult to compare to this work. However,\nour value for \u03b2DM does follow the same general radial relationship seen in earlier studies.\nIn general \u03b2sat for the substructure population\n(broadly) follows the dark matter distribution. However, for\nhalos #2 and #3, satellite orbits are generally more tangential than the dark matter background.\nFinally, to gain further insight into the velocity distributions of the satellite and dark matter distributions we investigated the radial variation of the radial velocity component.\nNote we do not present a figure for this results. When normalised by the maximum circular velocity for all eight halos,\nmax\nthe fraction vr,DM /Vcirc\nis essentially zero. Although, we do\nsee signs of a slight dip in the outer regions. This dip is a\ncharacteristic signature of infall into the system.\n\n5.1\n\nObservational Impact\n\nAstronomers traditionally determine the mass of galaxy\ncluster by assuming that the galaxy distribution is virialised.\n\n\f12\n\nGill et al.\n\nFigure 14. The velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxies within\nthe virial radius of the host halo as a function of host halo mass.\n\nThe virial theorem then gives (Heisler, Tremaine & Bahcall\n1985):\nRvir \u03c3v2\n.\n(10)\nG\nIn practice, however, the observational determination\nof the correct radius Rvir and velocity dispersion \u03c3v are far\nfrom straightforward, as it is difficult to determine whether\nor not a galaxy is a member of a cluster. Furthermore, even\nthough we have just learned that the satellites are \"stationary\", the existence of the slight global velocity bias (cf.\nTable 2) does impact the determination of cluster masses.\nOr in other words, the observed positive bias will result in\nan over-estimation of the halo mass when relying on the\ndynamics of its substructure.\nFrom our simulations we find (to no surprise) that the\nvelocity dispersion of a system of galaxies is a reliable indicator of the depth of the potential associated with the\nsystem. Even though we do not have a broad mass range\n(Mvir \u223c 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) to test this hypothesis we reconstruct the expected relationship between mass Mvir and\nvelocity dispersion \u03c3v,sat of the satellite galaxies within the\nvirial radius of the host halo. The results are presented in\nFigure 14. Each of our halos scatter about the expected analytical relationship:\n\nMvir =\n\n1/3\n\n\u03c3v \u223c Mvir\n\n(11)\n\nThis relationship can easily be understood analytically when\nwe combine Eq. (10) and our definition for virial radius\n3\n\u2206vir \u03c1b = 3Mvir /(4\u03c0Rvir\n). The solid line displayed in the\nfigure is the best fit power law to our eight data points. The\nlogarithmic slope was found to be \u223c 0.329, sufficiently close\nto the expected value of 1/3 .\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIf the hierarchical model of structure formation is correct\nthen the dynamics of satellite galaxies are an important in-\n\ngredient to also understanding the formation and the evolution of galaxies. Therefore, in this paper we presented a series of self-consistent cosmological simulations of dark matter halos with the required mass and spatial resolution to\nfollow satellite galaxies orbiting even within the central regions of the host potential. Moreover, the simulations had\nsufficient time resolution to actually resolve the satellite dynamics with high precision.\nThe first part of this study was dedicated to analysing\nand describing the differences in the host halos. These host\nhalos were chosen to sample a variety of triaxialities, formation times and mass/satellite accretion, despite being of\ncomparable mass. The halos also had very different formation histories, from quiescent to violent. When investigating\nthe halo environment we quantified a value of \"richness\"\nwhich was defined to be the fraction of satellite galaxies\nthat the halo had accreted since its formation. One interesting result from this analysis was the similar rate of satellite\ndisruption seen for all eight halos. Furthermore, over the\nhistory of each of our halos on average about 10% of its\nrespective mass is locked up in the satellite galaxies. Much\nof this mass can be attributed to massive satellites rapidly\ncaptured by dynamical friction.\nBut even though the eight dark matter host halos were\nquite different, their respective satellite population showed\nremarkable similarities. The average orbital eccentricity of\nthe satellites was found to be e \u2248 0.61 with minimal scatter (\u03c3 \u2248 0.19). Moreover, the average pericentre distance of\nthe satellites was p \u223c 35% of the virial radius for all halos, again with minimal scatter (\u03c3 \u2248 0.12). Satellites that\nwere disrupted while orbiting within the host's virial radius\nwere replaced with a mass-less tracer particle and hence we\nwere also able to present their orbital parameters at redshift\nz = 0. We found that even though they have smaller eccentricities (ed \u2248 0.34) than the surviving ones, their pericentre\ndistributions are nearly identical. Since the pericentres distributions of both surviving and disrupted satellites were\nsimilar, implication is that the disrupted satellites spend\nmore time in the deeper regions of the potential well. As\nsuch, they experience stronger tidal forces for longer periods, and are thus being disrupted more readily. We also\nnoticed that satellites with more orbits tend to have smaller\neccentricities. Difficult to explain through the application\nof dynamical friction we attribute this to the satellite's response to the growing host halo.\nWe also found that the local velocity bias at all radii\nis greater than one and this increases as we move closer to\nthe halo centre. Since this is a characteristic for each of our\nhalos, it strengthens the case that this is a general pattern of\nthe satellite population in dark matter halos. For the global\nvelocity bias we find an average hbv,global i \u223c 1.103 \u00b1 0.002,\na slight, but significant, positive bias. Further, if we restrict\nthe global velocity bias calculation to satellites that have\nhad at least one orbit we observe a 7% decrease in bias\nto hbv,global i \u223c 1.021 \u00b1 0.002. Thus when we just consider\nthe \"virialised\" satellites, the bias nearly vanishes. Finally\nwe recovered the \u03c3v \u223c M 1/3 relationship between satellite\nvelocity dispersion and halo mass.\nSurprisingly, all the above stated results appear to be\nindependent of the actual host halo and its history. We\nwere unable to identify any trends with richness, triaxiality\nand/or formation time (other than the number of orbits).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fLinking satellite dynamics to environment\nSuch similarities are suggestive of potential additional underlying CDM universal laws.\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe simulations presented in this paper were carried out\non the Beowulf cluster at the Centre for Astrophysics &\nSupercomputing, Swinburne University.

Jcirc (E) is the corresponding angular momentum for a circular orbit with the\nsame energy E.\nThe connection needs to be derived using the fact that\nboth orbits share the same total energy, so we wish to express E as a function of J in both cases, where the general\nexpression for E and J reads:\nE\n\n=\n\n1 2\nv\n2\n\nJ\n\n=\n\n|~r \u00d7 ~v |\n\n\u2212\n\nGM\nr\n\n(13)\n\nCircular Orbits\nFor a circular orbit we know that |~r \u00d7 ~v | reduces to\nJcirc = rvcirc\n\n(14)\n\nas both vectors are always orthogonal.
