We analyze the influence of the fractal distribution of defects on the evolution of the incommensurate phase and show that a phase transition occurs in the incommensurate phase that\nis accompanied by the inversion loss.\n\n1 Introduction In recently discovered multiferroic\nmaterials RMnO3 (with the perovskite structure; R - different rare earths, such as Tb, Gd, Dy) and RMn2O5 (R =\nTb, Ho, Dy), as well as in hexaferrites TbMnO3 the ferroelectric order occurs in the magnetically ordered phase [1].\nLet's recollect that the magnetoelectric effect permits\none to create electric polarization in some systems by applying an external magnetic field. If an external field can\ndo it, it is possible that the same can happen spontaneously\ndue to an internal field or due to certain magnetic ordering\n[1]. Besides, if we consider the system undergoing phase\ntransition of the second order at temperature T\u0441, applying\nof a weak external field (magnetic or electrical) can lead to\nan incommensurate phase with finite temperature width\n[2]. This supposition allows an extension of the incommensurate phase theory to multiferroics. An intriguing feature\nof multiferroics is a coexistence the spontaneously induced\npolarization and magnetic ordering in the incommensurate\nphases of these compounds. Incommensurate phases can\nbe described in the framework of the Landau phase transitions theory. In the framework of the Landau theory such\ntransitions in multiferroics are described by reducible representation of the space group of the high-symmetry phase.\nThe form of the coupling of electric polarization P to magnetization M can be found using general symmetry arguments. Namely, ferroelectricity can appear if the spin rotation axis e does not coincide with wave vector of a spiral\nQ: the polarization P appears only if these two directions\nare different, and it is proportional to the vector product of\ne and Q, P ~ [e\u00d7Q] [1].\n\nIn doped crystals it is proper inhomogeneity of structure [3]. Presence of inhomogeneities, internal fields and\nimpurities in structure leads to necessity to investigate influence of defects on incommensurable phases.\nThe paper has the following structure: first, we solve\nthe problem of two-dimensionally modulated incommensurate phases in multiferroics. Then, we perform a symmetry\nanalysis of the incommensurate phases structure. Finally,\nwe analyze the influence of the fractal distribution of defects on incommensurate phases.\n2 Coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric\nordering in 2D modulated incommensurate\nphases Let us assume that a crystal with the average\nspace group G in the paramagnetic phase undergoes a\nmagnetic phase transition at critical point Tc. Let the order\nparameter (\u03b71, \u03b72) (magnetization components) transformed by the active irreducible representation D of the\nsymmetry group of the paramagnetic phase corresponding\nto point q0 = (0,0,0) of Brillouin zone.

We discuss crystal structures that possess heterogeneity as a consequence of\nthe fact that they are formed by various atoms [3]. Due to this, these structures have averaged space group symmetry.\nConsequently, the free energy density that corresponds to these structures can always contain low order gradient of the\norder parameter, even if such forms are not allowed by the symmetry.\nThe free energy functional is presented in the form\n\n(\n\n)\n\nF = \u222b\u222b f y, z , \u03c6 ( y, z ), \u03c6 \u2032y , \u03c6 \u2032z dydz .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03a9\n\nFrom the extreme condition of the free energy functional density for Py and Pz we obtain Py = (\u03c3\u03c12/\u03c7)(\u2202\u03c6/\u2202z),\nPz = (g\u03c12/\u03c7)(\u2202\u03c6/\u2202y).

Therefore in incommensurate phase, the antiferromagnetic ordering in the incommensurate phase coexists with antiferroelectic ordering.\n3 Symmetry analysis Let us consider the phase\ntransition sequence high-symmetry \u2013 incommensurate \u2013\ncommensurate phase described with irreducible representation of the space group symmetry of parent phase [5]. It\ncan be shown that if the symmetry space group in the parent phase contains inversion, the superspace group of the\nincommensurate phase also contains it. For this we assume\nthat the incommensurate phase is described by the order\nparameter which is transformed according to irreducible\nrepresentation D0(k) of the space group symmetry G of the\nparent phase, where k is an arbitrary representative of the\nirreducible representation star {k*}.\nLet {Qij}, i = 1,..., n, j = 1,..., p is the order parameter\nwhere n is the number of wave vectors in star {k*} of the\nirreducible representation D0(k) and p is the dimension of\nits small representation; then dimension of D0(k) is\ns = n \u00d7 p. The symmetry group of the incommensurate\nphase contains those elements of the superspace group that\nleave the structure invariant. It means that these symmetry\nelements can be defined from equation\nQij\u2032 = Qij , i = 1,..., n, j = 1,..., p\n\n(8)\n\nwhere transformed value Qij\u2032 is defined as\nQij\u2032 = eiqi \u2217\u0453\u0457 \u2211 D0 (k , {R t })ikjm Qkm .\n\n(9)\n\nkm\n\nThe analysis of equations (8) and (9) shows that if the\nspace group symmetry of high\u2013symmetry phase contains\ninversion, the superspace group of the incommensurate\nphase also contains it. This implies that an ordering with\nthe mean value of the order parameter equal to zero can\noccur in the incommensurate phase.\nLet us consider the case when the sequence of phase\ntransitions high-symmetry \u2013 incommensurate \u2013 commensurate phase is described by the reducible representation\nD = D1 \u2295 D2 of the symmetry group of the parent phase\nwhere D1 and D2 determine transformation properties of\ntwo major order parameters. In this case, two situations\nmay occur. If expansion f-th symmetrized power of irreducible representation D1 contains the irreducible representation D2, i.e.\n\n[D1(k1 )] f\n\n= ... + D2 (k 2 ) + ...\n\n(10)\n\nthe incommensurate phase keeps all point group elements\nof the space group of high-symmetry phase. If expansion\n\nof [D1(k1)]f does not contain D2(k2), the point group symmetry of the incommensurate phase restricted to subgroups\nof the point group of the high-symmetry phase. It can be\nstated that in ideal crystals the point group symmetry of the\nincommensurate phase is strictly fixed in the temperature\nregion of its existence.\nIn the case we considered it is also possible to verify it\nin the following way: from the condition of the free energy\nminimum we define the spontaneous polarization P, and\nafter substitution of the obtained result in equation (1) the\nrenormalization of the free energy parameters takes place.\nConsequently, the superspace group of the incommensurate phase symmetry, defined from the expression for the\nfree energy, turns out to be the same as in the case of the\nzero spontaneous polarization. Thus, accounting for spontaneous polarization does not change the point group of the\nincommensurate phase symmetry. As in our case the space\ngroup of the paramagnetic phase contains inversion, the\nsuperspace group of the incommensurate phase symmetry\nalso contains inversion. It follows from this that in multiferroics in the incommensurate phase where magnetic and\nferroelectric orderings co-exist, mean values of magnetization and spontaneous polarization will be equal to zero.\nThe average values of magnetization and spontaneous polarization, different from zero, can be induced by the influence of the structure defects in the incommensurate phase.\n3 The effect of fractal distribution of defects\non incommensurate structure From the structure\ngenesis point of view, the crystals structure formed by different atoms can be regarded as a derivative of the close\npackages structure [3]. Usually, the symmetry of real derivative structures is lower than that of degenerate close\npacked crystals constructed from similar spheres. Besides,\nthe derivative composites are prone to various structural\nimperfections. Let us suppose that there is a space fluctuation of the effective local transition temperature and space\nfluctuations of crystalline fields in a derivative structure\n[6]. In this case it is possible to show that the order parameter distribution in the structure is defined with the\nTsallis distribution [7, 8]. Using this fact, we can show that\nthe equation of motion of the order parameter has a fractal\ngeneralization in the form\n\u2202\u03b1\u03c8 (x )\n\u2202x\u03b1\n\n+ sin\u03c8 (x ) = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b1/\u2202x\u03b1 - is the Riesz fractional derivative,\n\u03b1 = 2 \u2212 \u03b5 and \u03b1 \u2260 1,3,5,... .

The fractal distribution of defects leads to the principle change of evolution of the incommensurate phase.\nFor example, in the sinusoidal regime of the incommensurate phase the spatial modulation of the structure still persists. However, in the soliton regime of the incommensurate phase the structure becomes aperiodic and in the vicinity of the transition into the commensurate phase the order\nparameter phase falls to the commensurate value. It means\nthat the evolution of the incommensurate phase is accompanied by the element loss of the inversion centre of the\nsuperspace group of the structure. As a result, spontaneous\npolarization and magnetization occur in this structure.\n\n(17)\n\n[7]\n[8]\n\nand\n[9]\n\n(18)\n\nThe solution of equation (18) is a monotonously decreasing function which tends to \u03c8 (x ) = \u03c0k at large x,\nwhere k - is an integer number.\nThus, we may state that in the presence of the fractal\ndistribution of defects in the sinusoidal regime of the incommensurate phase, according to solution (15), the structure periodicity persists. Asymptotic solution of equation\n(16) shows that the periodicity of this structure is lost with\nthe evolution of the structure in the soliton regime of the\nincommensurate phase. Thus, if the mean values of the\nspontaneous polarization and magnetization in the sinusoidal regime of the incommensurate phase are equal to zero,\nin the soliton regime of the incommensurate phase they are\ndifferent from zero. Otherwise, it means that in the presence of the fractal distribution of defects during the evolution of the incommensurate phase from the sinusoidal regime to the soliton one the loss inversion of the superspace\ngroup of incommensurate phase occurs.\n4 Conclusions The accomplished analysis allows a\nconclusion that in multiferroics the mean value of spontaneous polarization and magnetization in the incommensurate phase equals to zero. It is also proved by the symmetry\nconsideration. Namely, if the space group of the paramag-\n\nD.I. Khomskii, arXiv:cond-mat/0601696v1 (2006).\nI.M. Vitebsky, JETP 82, 357 (1982).\nB.R.
