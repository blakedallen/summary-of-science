In at least one of the three objects optically\nthin non-thermal synchrotron emission appears to dominate when averaged over\ntheir whole spatial extent, while the spectrum of the second source shows a\nmarginal indication of a non-thermal spectrum.

Recent\nHST images of \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 2 angular resolution (Moffat et al. 1994) have shown that NGC 3603\nconsists of three Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and \u223c70 O-type stars, with an estimated 40\u201350 of\nthese stars located in the central \u223c30\u2032\u2032 \u00d730\u2032\u2032 (1 pc \u00d7 1 pc) region. The three H-rich WRstars of subtype WNL are also located within \u223c1\u2032\u2032 of each other in the central core and\nare the brightest members of the cluster. They are believed to be massive main sequence\nstars which, like the bright stars in R136a, drive very strong winds (De Koter et al. 1997;\nCrowther and Dessart 1998). NGC 3603 has also been shown to be a seat of active star\nformation outside the main cluster region (e.g. Brandner et al. (2000)). In particular, three\ndistinct dense cometary nebulae were detected there using HST and VLT: Are these ultra\ncompact H ii regions (UCHR) or ProPlyDs ?\nUCHRs are small (<0.1 pc) nebulae, internally photoionized by a deeply embedded,\nmassive star. Even though the embedded stars are very luminous, they are invisible at\noptical wavelengths because of the surrounding dust; instead they show strong far-infrared\nemission. Their radio continuum emission is often associated with OH and H2 O masers.\nThe morphology of UCHRs in high resolution radio continuum images ranges from spherical,\ncometary, core-halo, shell, to irregular (Wood and Churchwell 1989).\nIn contrast, a proto-planetary disk (ProPlyD) is a phenomenon describing a low-mass,\nyoung stellar object (YSO) with a circumstellar disk, embedded in a dense (neutral and\n1\n\nThe Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility\nmanaged by CSIRO.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nionized) envelope that is being externally photo-evaporated by the ultraviolet radiation from\none or more massive stars. These low-mass stars are not able to ionize their surroundings\nsignificantly. The disks in these systems are either observed directly (as in Orion where the\ndisks are seen directly or in silhouette against the bright background nebula (Bally et al.\n2000)), or are inferred because in almost all of the ProPlyDs (young) low-mass stars are\nvisible at optical or near-infrared wavelengths (see e.g. Stecklum et al. (1998)). At low\nangular resolution ProPlyDs look like UCHRs, but at high resolution, optical and nearinfrared images reveal their different nature. So most ProPlyDs would have been classified\nas UCHRs prior to those observations. In some cases the distinction between the two classes\nremains difficult. Given the fact that there are about four times more UCHRs than expected\n(Churchwell 1990) from star formation rates and the potential problems identifying host\nstars for UCHRs (e.g. some may not have enough FIR flux to account for an internal OB\nstar), it may well be that a large fraction of catalogued UCHRs are mis-identified ProPlyDs.\nInterferometric radio continuum observations of ProPlyDs are needed to determine their\nstructure, spectral indices and thus the nature of their emission, as well as mass loss rates\nand extinctions when compared to measured H\u03b1 fluxes.\nProPlyDs were first identified in the Orion Nebula6 , where over 150 of them are known\n(O'Dell et al. 1993). Two ProPlyDs have been identified in more distant nebulae: one\nin NGC 2024 by Stapelfeldt et al. (1997) and one, G5.97\u20131.17, in the Lagoon Nebula by\nStecklum et al. (1998). The three ProPlyD-like objects, hereafter referred to P1, P2 and P3,\nin NGC 3603 (Brandner et al. 2000) are the biggest, youngest and most massive ones found\nso far. They are also the most distant known. These emission nebulae are clearly resolved in\nthe HST/WFPC2 observations, and share the overall morphology of the ProPlyDs in Orion.\nAll three nebulae are rim-brightened and tear-drop shaped with the tails pointing away from\nthe central ionizing cluster.\nAccording to Brandner et al. (2000) the brightest object (P1), which has a projected\ndistance of 1.3 pc from the cluster, has the spectral (excitation) characteristics of a UCHR.\nOptical spectra reveal the presence of an underlying, heavily reddened continuum source,\nwhich is also confirmed by near-infrared VLT/ISAAC observations. The WFPC2 observations show that only the outermost layer is ionized whereas the interior is neutral. The\n6\n\nThere are a variety of different terms used in the literature for describing the knots of ionised gas in\nM 42 (Orion): e.g. CKs (cometary knots), PIGs (partially ionized globules), EIDERS (external ionised\n(accretion) disks in the environs of radiation sources), and ProPlyDs (proto-planetary disks); for a summary\nsee McCullough et al. (1995). Another expression being used is EGGs (for evaporating gaseous globules)\ndescribing the objects found in M 16 (Eagle Nebula). The cometary knots found in the Helix Nebula are\ncompact globules and very different from ProPlyDs as they contain no stars.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmorphology of P1 is described as a heart-shaped head with a collimated structure in between,\nwhich can be understood as the superposition of two individual ProPlyDs. In contrast, P2\nand P3, located at projected distances of 2.2 pc and 2.0 pc from the stellar cluster, respectively, show approximately axisymmetric morphologies. No embedded disk or central star\nhas been detected so far in any of these nebulae, preventing a clear identification as protoplanetary disks. The optical point source (see Fig. 2c) close to P3 is probably not physically\nlinked to the nebula (Brandner et al. 2000). The ProPlyD-like structures in NGC 3603 are\nabout two orders of magnitude fainter than typical UCHRs, but have a typical extent of\n9000 AU with tails extending to 21000 AU, much larger in size than the ProPlyDs in Orion.\nRecent 3.4 cm radio continuum and recombination line measurements of NGC 3603\nby De Pree et al. (1999), which were focussed on abundance measurements and the bright\ncontinuum emission from the ionized gas in this region, have an angular resolution of \u223c7\u2032\u2032\nand a 5\u03c3 sensitivity of 55 mJy. By obtaining high sensitivity and high angular resolution\n(\u223c1\u2032\u2032 \u20132\u2032\u2032 ) ATCA observations we primarily aimed to study the radio emission of the winds\nfrom many of the early-type stars in the cluster, as well as to detect and resolve the ProPlyDlike objects and other gaseous regions in the cluster periphery. This paper will focus on the\nProPlyD-like sources7 only, which have been detected and are shown to be clearly resolved\nwith the ATCA. A subsequent paper containing a detailed study of the whole NGC 3603\nregion based on our ATCA observations will follow.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nRadio continuum observations of NGC 3603 were made with the Australia Telecope\nCompact Array (ATCA) in the 6A, B, C and D configurations in five observing runs in\nFebruary, April, June, September and November 2000 with a total of 60 hours assigned\nobserving time. The observing frequencies were 4.8 GHz (6 cm) and 8.64 GHz (3 cm) with a\nbandwidth in each case of 128 MHz. Detailed observing parameters are given in Table 1. The\nthree data sets were combined, reduced and analysed in MIRIAD using standard procedures.\nThe full Stokes parameters were measured. The flux density scale was calibrated using\nobservations of the primary calibrator, 1934\u2013638, assuming flux densities of 2.84 and 5.83\nJy at 3 and 6 cm, respectively.\nA primary beam correction was carried out. To obtain high angular resolution and filter\n7\n\nThroughout this paper we use the term \"ProPlyD-like\" for these cometary-shaped objects in NGC 3603,\nsince the identification of these objects as true ProPlyDs is premature, owing to the lack of a clear detection\nof a central disk or star.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe extended emission to emphasize the small scale structure we used uniform weighting of\nthe uv data while omitting the shortest baselines, up to 25 k\u03bb, respectively. We find that for\na 25 k\u03bb cutoff all bright extended nebula emission is removed from the ProPlyD-like objects\neven at 6 cm. Fig. 1 shows an example of a combined 3 cm radio map where a uv cut of\n10 k\u03bb was chosen. A zoom on the three ProPlyD-like objects is shown in Fig. 2. For the\n6 cm maps a uv cut of 25 k\u03bb was used. The average r.m.s. in these combined radio maps was\napproximately 0.2 mJy at 3 cm and 0.4 mJy at 6 cm, but varies throughout the map. The\nr.m.s. levels near the ProPlyD-like objects, which lie in rather empty regions, were \u223c 0.1\nmJy at 3 cm and \u223c 0.2 mJy at 6 cm. The dynamic range in the 3 and 6 cm images is about\n1:100. Fitting a 2D-Gaussian to the dirty beam gives FWHM values of 0.\u2032\u2032 94 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 77 to 1.\u2032\u2032 06\n\u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 87 at 3 cm and 1.\u2032\u2032 53 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 23 to 1.\u2032\u2032 83 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 49 at 6 cm depending on the uv cut employed.\nIn Fig. 2 we have restored the cleaned maps with a circular Gaussian beam of width 1\u2032\u2032 at\n3 cm and 2\u2032\u2032 at 6 cm.\nTo create spectral index maps between 3 and 6 cm we convolved the 3 cm map with a\nGaussian appropriate to achieve the resolution of the beam FWHM at 6 cm. The spectral\nindex maps were then derived from the 6 cm and convolved 3 cm maps using a clip value of\n1.0 mJy beam\u22121 , corresponding to approximately 10\u03c3 at 3 cm and 5\u03c3 at 6 cm (statistical\nerrors). Error maps for the spectral index maps were calculated using error propagation.-\nWe note, however, that spectral indices of extended sources as obtained from interferometric\ndata have to be regarded with caution.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nThe three ProPlyD-like sources found with the ATCA at 3 and 6 cm are clearly resolved,\nshowing a head-tail extent of \u223c4\u2032\u2032 (see Fig. 2). P3 shows the most pronounced head-tail\nstructure with a 3 cm flux density ratio between head and tail of about 10:1. The tail is very\nwell defined and at least 2\u2032\u2032 long, pointing away from the central star cluster. Unfortunately,\nP3 is rather faint in the low-sensitivity HST broad band image shown by Brandner et al.\n(2000); it is located outside the region of their high-sensitivity H\u03b1 image.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.1.\n\nProPlyD structure and fluxes\n\nThe three ProPlyD-like objects have a cometary or head-tail shape8 at cm-radio wavelengths, matching their appearance in optical images (see Fig. 2).\nIntegrated radio flux densities and peak fluxes are derived by summing over the whole\nProPlyD-like objects, and by fitting circular Gaussians to each object. Statistical flux uncertainties are estimated as map r.m.s. times number of beamsizes covered by the source.\nDependent on the method of flux determination, beam size and uv cut employed to the maps\n(5, 10, 15, 20, 25 k\u03bb) the resulting flux densities vary. The standard deviation of this variation is considered as systematic uncertainty. We found that the systematic uncertainties are\nalways larger than the statistical error. In Table 2 we report the average fluxes and their\nuncertainties of all 3 nebulae, together with their average spectral indices derived from the\nintegrated fluxes.\nCircular Gaussians9 are used to at least attempt disentangling the head and tail structures in these cometary-shaped objects. The radio heads of the ProPlyD-like objects are\ntypically 2\u2032\u2032 \u20133\u2032\u2032 in diameter while the total head-tail extent is \u223c4\u2032\u2032 . P3 shows the most\npronounced head-tail structure of the three (most likely due to the viewing angle) and the\nsmallest head (diameter \u223c2\u2032\u2032 ) among all three ProPlyD-like objects, with the largest peak\nflux at 3 cm while the integrated head flux is comparable. Its head-to-tail flux ratio is about\n10:1, whereas in the other two ProPlyD-like objects part of the tail may be confused with\nthe head flux density.\nBoth, P1 and P2, appear inclined with respect to the plane of the sky, with P1 inclined\nat a larger angle than P2. This can be seen in Fig. 2 where we have indicated the projected\ndirection to the ionizing source. Fig. 3 shows the residual radio continuum image of P1\nafter removing a single circular Gaussian component. The residual map of P1 shows two\nexcess emission sites, one corresponding to the tail, and a second one north of it. Recent H\u03b1\nimages indicate that P1 is composed of two separate cometary-shaped objects (Brandner et\nal. 2000). We interpret the northern excess as the second head. A two component Gaussian\nfit to P1 at 3 cm gives peak fluxes of 4.6 mJy beam\u22121 and 1.4 mJy beam\u22121 , and integrated\nflux densities of 9.9 mJy and 5.7 mJy for the two heads, with a separation of the two peaks\nof 1.\u2032\u2032 3. A two component model could not be applied to the lower resolution 6-cm data.\nThe tails of all three ProPlyD-like objects are directed away from the star cluster,\n8\n\nThe silhouette of ProPlyDs has variously been referred to as cometary, tadpole, tear-drop or simply\nhead-tail shaped.\n9\n\nWe find that elliptical Gaussians instead of circular ones would fit too much tail flux to the head.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\napproximately coincident with the tails in H\u03b1 within the positional uncertainty of the radio/optical pointings (see Fig. 2; note the shift of 0.\u2032\u2032 5 in declination and right ascension\nof the HST-image which we have employed in these figures). The uncertainty of the radio\nposition is \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 15 while HST has a pointing uncertainty of < 1\u2032\u2032 .\nThe present data were obtained in all four Stokes parameters. No polarization signal\nabove 3\u03c3 was detected.\nPossible flux variability on timescales & days expected from e.g. flaring pre-main sequence (PMS) stars with non-thermal radio spectra, cannot be tested with the present data.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectral indices of the ProPlyDs\n\nThe radio continuum fluxes (see Table 2) are a factor of 9 to 21 larger than those predicted by Brandner et al. (2000) assuming optically-thin thermal bremsstrahlung as the radio\nemission mechanism (McCullough et al. 1995), which scales with the (extinction corrected)\nH\u03b1 flux. The neutral part of the envelope of the ProPlyD-like object may attenuate H\u03b1\nphotons from the far side of the object depending on the viewing angle. However, McCullough et al. (1995) have estimated this effect to be less than 25% of the total H\u03b1 light for an\nisotropic ensemble of ProPlyDs. Furthermore, the reasonable coincidence of the sizes of the\nProPlyD-like objects in the radio and optical band suggests that this effect is not important\nhere. For P1 and P3 the integrated fluxes at 6 cm are higher than that at 3 cm, whereas\nsimilar flux densities were predicted. The average spectral index of each object, shown in\nTable 2, is calculated on the basis of the integral fluxes at 3 cm and 6 cm in this table.\nModeling the uv distribution of the 6 cm map to match the uv distribution at 3 cm gives\nsimilar results.\nThe average spectral indices of P1 and P3 are negative (P3 only marginally), between\n\u03b1 = \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.2 and \u22120.3 \u00b1 0.2 (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ), indicating non-thermal emission, while the\nspectrum of P2 (\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.2) is in agreement with the expectation from optically thin\nthermal bremsstrahlung.\nHydrodynamic simulations predict spectral indices of \u03b1 \u2248 0 near the ionization fronts,\nwhich can increase up to \u03b1 \u2248 0.6 when considering in addition a hydrodynamically collimated\njet (S. Richling, private communication). Negative spectral indices cannot be explained by\nthis model.\nBecause of the high resolution and sensitivity in the radio maps, we were able to generate\nspectral index maps for all three ProPlyD-like objects. Fig. 4 shows examples of the spectral\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nindex maps. Here we used the radio maps shown in Fig. 2 and constrain ourselves to\nbrightness densities greater than 1.0 mJy beam\u22121 , which corresponds to roughly 5 \u03c3 at 6 cm\nand 10 \u03c3 at 3 cm (based on statistical error estimates). The radio emission zone within\neach ProPlyD-like object appears to be inhomogeneous. The spectra in at least two of the\nsources appear steeper in the tail than in the head, with a tendency of positive spectral\nindices located towards the region facing the ionizing star cluster.\n\n3.3.\n\nExtinction towards the ProPlyDs\n\nMelnick et al. (1989) have derived the reddening towards NGC 3603 from UBV photometry, and found AV \u2248 4 \u2212 5 mag for the cluster core. However, as can be seen in their\ndata, the visual extinction is not uniform across the whole star forming region, but increases\nsignificantly with distance from the star cluster, mainly towards the North and the South.\nThis is confirmed by recent VLT/ISAAC data on the basis of 4750 stars, showing that the\nextinction can be as high as AV \u2248 14 mag (Brandner, private communication). For example, star MTT 68, close to P3, has AV \u2248 6.2 mag, whereas star MTT 81 near P1 has\nAV \u2248 4.7 mag, and star MTT 79 close to P2 has extinction AV \u2248 5.2 mag. Here we use\nR = AV /EB\u2212V \u2248 3.2 as used by Melnick et al. (1989) for NGC 3603. Thus, it appears\nlikely that P2 and P3 suffer from stronger foreground extinction than the stars in the cluster\ncenter which have on average AV . 4.5 mag.\nUsing the ratio between radio flux density and H\u03b1 flux as given by McCullough et al.,\n(1995; their equation 5) and assuming that the radio flux density at 3 cm is dominated by\nthermal bremsstrahlung, we predict the H\u03b1 flux using our 3 cm radio continuum data. The\npredicted fluxes are then compared to the H\u03b1 fluxes measured by Brandner et al. (2000)\nand used to derive lower limits for the extinction, AH\u03b1 . (If (gyro-)synchrotron radiation\ndominates the radio emission, which comes from an emitting region as specified in Sect. 4.4,\nthe derived extinction AH\u03b1 would be higher, with the exact value depending on the magnetic\nfield.) Table 3 shows the calculated fluxes (assuming Te = 104 K) and extinctions. Note the\nuncertainty in comparing different areas for which the H\u03b1 fluxes and the radio continuum\nfluxes have been obtained. Brandner et al. (2000) give the H\u03b1 surface brightness of the\nProPlyD-like object heads, measured for a 0.\u2032\u2032 5 aperture radius, whereas we quote peak\nfluxes per beam where the beam size is \u223c1.\u2032\u2032 0\u00d71.\u2032\u2032 0. For AH\u03b1 \u2248 0.85AV , we find AV \u2248 6.0\nfor P1 and AV \u2248 6.7 for P2. We find thus significant excess extinction for both ProPlyDlike objects, which may be intrinsic to the ProPlyD-like objects themselves, otherwise the\nextinction estimate derived from the stars is underestimated.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.4.\n\nProPlyD densities and mass-loss rates\n\nEstimates for the electron/ion density inside the heads can be obtained from our radio\ndata if thermal bremsstrahlung dominates the radio emission. This is likely to be the case\nfor P2 and maybe P3, while for P1 the derived values should be considered as upper limits.\nThe bremsstrahlung intensity in the radio domain for a thermal, ionized H-gas of constant\ndensity in a sphere is (Mezger and Henderson 1967)\n3\n\u22120.1 \u22120.35\nSradio \u2248 1.9Dkpc fth \u03b8sec\nNe,4Nion,4 \u03bdGHz\nT4\nmJy,\n\nwhere Dkpc is the source distance in kpc, \u03b8sec is the apparent radius of the source in arcsec,\nNe,4 and Nion,4 are the densities of the thermal electrons and ions, respectively, in 104 cm\u22123 ,\n\u03bdGHz is the observing frequency in GHz and T4 is the electron temperature of the ionized gas\nin 104 K. fth is the ratio of thermally emitting to total volume of the source, and is introduced\nto account for the possibility of smaller emitting volumes than the apparent extent of the\nsource. This is likely because only the outermost layers in ProPlyDs are believed to be\nionized. We estimate the ProPlyD heads \u223c 2-3\u2032\u2032 in diameter. For T4 = 1 and Ne \u2248 Nion\nwe estimate the electron density by comparing the expected radio flux with the observed\n\u22121/2\n3 cm ProPlyD head flux densities, and find Ne =(9, 7 and 13)*103fth\ncm\u22123 for P1, P2\nand P3, respectively. (The corresponding emission measures are EM = 5.9, 3.5 and 9.3\n\u22122/3\n\u00d7106 fth\ncm\u22126 pc.) If the emitting volume is smaller than the total source volume, the\nelectron density and emission measure increase accordingly. From spectral considerations\nthe emission must be optically thin, i.e. free-free absorption may set in at frequencies lower\nthan 4.8 GHz. Thus values of EM cannot exceed \u223c several 107 cm\u22126 pc, in order to avoid\nfree-free absorption at frequencies above 4.8 GHz. This constrains the size of the thermally\nemitting volume of the 3 ProPlyD-like objects to at least 4%, 2% and 9% of the total source\nvolumes, and consequently puts limits on the thermal electron densities in the sources: 4.5,\n4.9 and 4.3 *104 cm\u22123 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Note that these numbers should be\nconsidered as upper limits if the observed radio flux is dominantly of non-thermal origin.\nThese numbers are in reasonable agreement with Ne \u2265 104 cm\u22123 derived from [SII] line\nratios by Brandner et al. (2000). For the Orion ProPlyDs densities of order 105 \u2212 106 cm\u22123\nhave been found (Henney and O'Dell 1999). Note that our derived numbers suffer from\nuncertainties due to the unknown geometrical projection angle of the ProPlyD-like objects,\nand hence the true source diameters.\nMass loss from the ProPlyD-like objects occurs through external heating of the envelope by the far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field from hot stars, especially from the core\nof NGC 3603, and subsequent evaporation. Knowing the electron density, the mass-loss\nrate in a wind is given by \u1e40 = 4\u03c0R2 Ne \u03bcmH vW , with R the system radius, mH the ion\nmass and vW the evaporation velocity. Assuming a pure hydrogen gas, \u03bc = 1.3, we find\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\u1e40 /v20 \u2248 (5 \u2212 10) \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 year\u22121 for the heads of all three ProPlyD-like objects, where\nv20 is the wind velocity in units of 20 km s\u22121 . Brandner et al. (2000) found evaporation\nflow velocities of order 10\u201325 km s\u22121 . The derived upper limits for the mass-loss rates are of\nthe same order as estimated by Brandner et al. (2000), and about two orders of magnitude\nhigher than the typical values for the Orion ProPlyDs.\nA rough estimate of the mass reservoir of the NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects can then\nbe derived by multiplying the mass loss rate with an estimated evaporation time scale of\n\u223c 105 years (Brandner et al. 2000). This gives a mass for the ProPlyD-like objects of order\n1\u201310 M\u2299 , 10\u20131000 times larger than for the Orion ProPlyDs. The radius of the putative\ndisks in these massive objects can be estimated using the evaporation model of Johnstone et\nal. (1997) which considers the mass reservoir in a disk-like shape. We find an approximate\ndisk radius of 2000 AU (\u2248 0.3\u2032\u2032 ) for all three NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects: Brandner et\nal. (2000) found \u223c3400 AU from hydrodynamical simulations.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nComparison with the ProPlyDs in the Orion and Lagoon Nebulae\n\nThe ProPlyD-like objects in NGC 3603 are 20\u201330 times larger and much more spectacular than those in Orion, which were detected at 2 and 20 cm with the VLA (see McCullough\net al. (1995) and references therein; Henney and O'Dell (1999)).\nOrion contains numerous dense clumps, originally classified as UCHRs, but now known\nto be ProPlyDs. Most Orion ProPlyDs have central disks, sometimes seen only in silhouette\nagainst the background light. On recent HST-images dozens of jets powered by young stars\nembedded in ProPlyDs have been found (Bally et al. 2000). All Orion ProPlyDs detected at\nradio wavelengths are non-variable thermal emitters with spectral indices between \u20130.1 and\n0.2 (Felli et al. 1993), and located within 0.04 pc of the dominant ionizing O-star (\u03b81 Ori C).\nThe non-thermal Orion radio sources show strong variability, and are mostly associated with\nvisible pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. Their non-thermal spectra are usually explained as\ndue to stellar flaring activity.\nG5.97\u20131.17 (D = 1.8 kpc) was originally classified as an ultracompact H ii region, but\nis now thought to be a ProPlyD at \u223c 5000 AU projected distance from the O7 star Herschel\n36 in the center of M8, the Lagoon Nebula (Stecklum et al. 1998). ESO near-infrared,\nHST optical and VLA radio continuum observations indicate that G5.97\u20131.17 is a young\nstar surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is likely being photo-evaporated by Her 36,\nsimilar to the ProPlyDs in Orion. The previous hypothesis suggested that G5.97\u20131.17 is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\na UCHR intrinsically ionized by an embedded B0 star. However, Stecklum et al. (1998)\nshowed that G5.97\u20131.17 is predominantly externally ionized, and thus the spectral type of\nthe embedded star should be later than B5. The H\u03b1 flux over 0.\u2032\u2032 6 is consistent with the\n\u03bb = 2 cm appearance. Optical and near infrared (NIR) continuum images show the central\nstar is displaced from the peak of the bow shock by 0.\u2032\u2032 125. NIR photometry of G5.97\u20131.17\nrevealed that its central star is extremely red, which cannot be explained by extinction laws\nthat use spherical matter distributions. This supports the idea of the circumstellar matter\nsurrounding the central star of G5.97\u20131.17 being arranged as a disk. The cm-radio spectrum\nof G5.97\u20131.17 appears flat, which is interpreted as optically thin free-free emission (Wood\nand Churchwell 1989; Doherty et al. 1994). No OH or H2 O masers, which are often associated\nwith UCHRs, are known in G5.97\u20131.17.\nIn comparison, the NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects appear rather peculiar and spectacular. Not only are they the largest and most massive ones found so far. Exposed to an\nextremely strong FUV radiation field, they also suffer the largest mass losses, though their\ndistances from the ionizing source are larger than for the Orion or Lagoon Nebula ProPlyDs.\nNo embedded source nor disk has been found for any of the NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects.\nAt cm-wavelengths they are so far the only ProPlyD-like objects showing non-thermal radio\nemission.\nThe spatial distribution of the NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects is also peculiar. They are\nnot only distributed apparently along a straight line (see Sect. 4.3 for further discussion), but\nall three also lie clearly to the north of the ionized gas region and avoid the region north-east\nand south-west from the stellar cluster. This is in contrast to the Orion ProPlyDs which do\nnot appear to be located in preferred regions of the nebula (e.g. Bally et al. (2000)). Since\nsequential star formation proceeding from north to south seems evident in NGC 3603 (e.g.\nDe Pree et al. (1999)), this suggests that the ProPlyD-like structures in this region might\nhave emerged just recently.\n\n4.2.\n\nExternal versus internal ionization\n\nA possible way to prove that the ProPlyD-like objects have indeed been ionized externally by the star cluster is to show that the observed radio fluxes for the ProPlyD-like objects\nare consistent with the number of ionizing photons they receive from the cluster stars. For\nsimplicity we assume thermal radio emission, and note that this leads to an upper limit for\nthe number of ionizing photons needed to produce the observed radio flux density. In this\ncase the brightness temperature is directly proportional to the number of ionizing photons.\nBecause NGC 3603 contains a large number of stars that are extremely hot and luminous\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthey provide an ionizing flux that is several orders of magnitude larger than that in Orion\nor M 8 (see Table 4). The expected brightness temperatures at the projected distances of\n1.3 pc, 2.2 pc and 2.0 pc of the ProPlyD-like objects from the ionizing source due to a Lyman\nflux of 1051 photons s\u22121 (Brandner et al. 2000) are 200 K, 70 K and 90 K at 3 cm assuming\nT4 = 1. This is only slightly higher than our estimates derived from the ATCA 3 cm maps\nof 40 K, 30 K and 70 K for the three ProPlyD-like objects, respectively. We can also compare the number of ionizing photons required to deliver the observed flux densities at the\nlocation of the ProPlyD-like objects, and compare this number with the number of Lyman\nphotons they receive from the star cluster. Noting that the ProPlyD-like objects subtend\na fraction of (6, 3 and 2)*10\u22125 , of the total solid angle seen by the cluster stars, they thus\nreceive (6, 3 and 2)*1046 photons s\u22121 , respectively. On the other hand, the required number\nof ionizing photons at the location of each ProPlyD-like object to deliver the observed radio\nflux density is about 2 * 1046 photons s\u22121 in all three cases. These comparisons show that\nthe number of required Lyman photons is slightly lower than provided by the star cluster,\nand thus would even allow an additional dust attenuation and/or, more likely, longer linear\ndistances between the ProPlyD-like objects and the ionizing source in the external ionizing\nscenario. Significant ionizing power from within the ProPlyD-like objects appears therefore\nunlikely, which puts the spectral type of any central stars to later than \u223cB1, and hence mass\nto below \u223c 10 M\u2299 .\n\n4.3.\n\nDo the ProPlyD-like objects host disks ?\n\nThe present radio data as well as the recently published HST/VLT-images do not provide\nany direct evidence that the observed ProPlyD-like objects in NGC 3603 host any (proto)stellar objects or disks. To a limiting Ks -magnitude of 18, no circumstellar disk or central\nstellar object in any of the three ProPlyD-like objects has been detected by HST+VLT\nobservations. Instead the cometary-shaped nebulae may rather be massive emission regions\nphoto-ionized by the radiation from the star cluster. Mellema et al. (1998) have presented\nmodel calculations for such clumps, called FLIERs or ANSEA which are commonly located\nalong the major axis towards the ionizing source. Indeed, all three ProPlyD-like objects\napparently lie approximately along one straight line, with the outflow source, Sher 25, located\nroughly midway between P1 and P3. Although the bipolar outflow from Sher 25 appears\nnot to point in the direction of any of the three ProPlyD-like sources, the ring-like structure\naround Sher 25, roughly perpendicular to its jet, has been shown to expand with a velocity\nof \u223c 30 km s\u22121 (Brandner et al. 1997), and could in principle be related to the origin of the\nProPlyD-like clumps. In addition, models such as the FLIER model which are not based\non disk-like mass distributions typically give short evaporation times, inconsistent with the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ndistance of the ProPlyD-like objects from Sher 25 (W. Brandner, private communication)\nand the approximate date of the mass-loss event about 6630 years ago in Sher 25 (Brandner\net al. 1997). Thus, the existence of such features at large distances from the cluster centre\nappears to favor models where most of the material is concentrated in compact structures\nsuch as disks. The actual presence of disk-like structures is however not confirmed.\n\n4.4.\n\nThe possible origin of the non-thermal emission\n\nThe significantly non-thermal spectrum (\u03b1 \u226a 0, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) from at least one of the\nthree NGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects (P1; P3 seems to be marginally non-thermal) appears\nto be steepest (\u03b1 < \u22120.5) in the tail, slightly flatter (\u03b1 = \u22120.5 to 0.1) in the head, and\nhave a tendency of positive spectral indices (\u03b1 > 0) located towards the region facing the\nionizing star cluster rather than away from it. This is not expected from non-thermal radio\nemission from a wind\u2013wind collision region. The non-thermal radiation must originate rather\nfrom inside the ProPlyD-like objects, either from their putative central stars hidden behind\nthick material, the surrounding disks or the envelopes. A stellar origin analogous to active\nstar coronal emission seems to be unlikely because of the extended nature of the observed\nsource. Non-thermal radio spectra could be produced by a population of energetic particles\nemitting synchrotron, gyrosynchrotron or gyroresonance radiation in a magnetic field. For\ngyrosynchrotron radiation the emission is concentrated at harmonic numbers s = \u03bd/\u03bdB =\n10\u2212100 (where \u03bdB \u2248 2.8*10\u22123BG GHz is the gyrofrequency, BG is the magnetic field strength\nin Gauss), and thus magnetic fields strengths of order B \u2248 20 \u2212 200 G are required. These\nhigh field values cannot be present in extended sources, which leaves synchrotron radiation\nas the only plausible emission mechanism.\nDisk or envelope, whatever the ultimate source might be, the negative spectral indices\nsuggest optically thin non-thermal processes as the dominant radiation mechanism in P1, and\nmaybe P3. One could argue that the shock created by the evaporation flow predicted in ProPlyD models could accelerate charged particles within the objects. Other possibilities may\nbe inflow-outflow activity causing shocks during the early stage of star formation, compression and reconnection of magnetic fields in the collapsing envelope, or magnetic reconnection\nin star\u2013disk interactions in Young Stellar Objects leading to production of energetic particles. Magnetic fields are known to exist in Molecular Clouds (Crutcher 1999), and therefore\nit appears plausible that gas clumps still contain \"fossil\" fields. In a magnetized plasma,\nacceleration due to particle collisions and subsequent bremsstrahlung can often be negligible\nin comparison with acceleration due to gyration around the field lines. In place of free-free\nemission, there is then synchrotron emission from energetic particles. The negative radio\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nspectral indices in P1 and P3 are conveniently explained by non-thermal particle spectra.\n\u22121/2\nBecause thermal bremsstrahlung is proportional to Ne2 Te\nand synchrotron emission is\n\u03b2\nproportional to Ne B (\u03b2 > 0), the former dominates if the density is high enough, or if\nthe temperature or field strength is low enough. Indeed the electron densities found in the\nNGC 3603 ProPlyD-like objects are \u223ctwo orders of magnitude smaller than in the Orion\nProPlyDs (see Table 4). The different energy dependencies of the two kinds of emission may\nlead to one dominating at low frequencies and the other at high frequencies.\nA lower limit for a possible magnetic field is given by the Razin-Tsytovich effect. In order\nto avoid a Razin-suppression of the radio spectrum above \u03bb = 6 cm the magnetic field cannot\nbe smaller than \u223c 10\u22125 G for an electron density of 104 cm\u22123 in the emission region. On\nthe other hand, to avoid gyroresonance absorption above \u03bb = 6 cm the field strength cannot\nbe higher than 103 G. The equipartition magnetic field, the minimum possible value in flare\nloops, for a Te = 104 K particle distribution with density 104 cm\u22123 , is \u223c 10\u22123 G. Note that\nsynchrotron photons of energy 4.8 GHz in a 10\u22125 G field must have been produced by \u223c 10\nGeV electrons. Efficient particle acceleration may occur, e.g., at the ProPlyD surface, from\nflow amplification of even very weak ambient magnetic fields followed by local reconnection\nevents (e.g. Shore & Larosa (1999)).\nThe flux density from a homogeneous sphere with diameter l due to synchrotron radiation in a uniform field and a low energy cutoff Emin,MeV in units MeV of a E \u2212\u03b1e particle\ndistribution with \u03b1e = 2 spectral index10 is given by (e.g. Dulk 1985)\n1.5\n3\n\u22122 \u22120.5\nS\u03bd,syn \u2248 5 \u00d7 1018 Ne,nt,4 BG\nEmin,MeV lpc\nDkpc\n\u03bdGHz mJy .\n\nThe non-thermal electrons might have been energized by e.g. shock acceleration or magnetic\nreconnection events, out of the pool of thermal particles, or they may be Galactic cosmic\nrays penetrating the starforming region. In the latter case Ne,nt \u2248 10\u22122 . . . 10\u22121 cm\u22123 and\n\u03b1e \u2248 2.4, and thus B \u2248 10\u22123 G (for Emin,MeV = 1). For the former case, because energy\nis conserved, the production efficiency of the high energy particles is related to the properties of the thermal background particles, and vice versa. Realistic non-linear diffusive\nparticle acceleration scenarios typically yield Ne,nt /Ne \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22121 (i.e. the fraction of\ntotal electrons which end up with high energies; e.g. Ellison et al. (2000)), while magnetic\nreconnection might be as efficient as Ne,nt /Ne \u223c 0.01 for the present densities and temperature (Tandberg-Hanssen & Emslie 1988). Since the thermal electron density Ne cannot\nbe significantly smaller than \u2248 104 cm\u22123 (derived from [SII] line ratios; see Sect.3.4), and\nNe,nt \u2264 Ne if thermal and non-thermal electrons have the same source, we find that the size\n10\n\nShock acceleration typically predicts a E \u22122 power law, which we use as a reasonable assumption here.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nof the actual magnetized volume emitting non-thermal radiation must be smaller than the\nappearance of the ProPlyD-like object on the sky for this case. If particle trapping is at\nwork, Ne,nt \u2265 Ne is possible, and consequently the ratio of emitting to total volume of the\nProPlyD-like object becomes even smaller.\nThe present data, however, do not allow to quantitatively constrain the actual size of\nthe source responsible for the non-thermal radiation.\nWe note that the recent discovery of variable X-ray emission from some ProPlyDs in\nOrion by Schulz et al. (2000) support the idea of a non-thermal emission volume smaller\nthan the appearance of the ProPlyD-like object on the sky. The size of the emitting region\nwas estimated on the basis of variability arguments to order 1\u201310 AU.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe three massive (\u223c1\u201310 M\u2299 ) ProPlyD-like nebulae in NGC 3603, which have recently\nbeen discovered by Brandner et al. (2000), have been clearly detected and resolved with the\nATCA at 3 and 6 cm, with one of them likely to be composed of two cometary-shaped\nobjects. Their flux densities are about 10\u201320 times higher than expected from the H\u03b1\nmeasurements, and a non-thermal average spectrum can be associated with at least one of\nthe three ProPlyD-like sources. This is the first time that non-thermal radio emission has\nbeen detected from ProPlyD-like sources. Our spectral index maps show that the emission\nregion is rather inhomogeneous, with negative spectral indices in the tail and part of the head\nwhereas positive spectral indices, indicating thermal free-free emission, tend to be detected\nfrom a small region facing the star cluster.\nWe derive upper limits for the mass-loss rates of 10\u22125 M\u2299 year\u22121 and electron densities\nof 104 cm\u22123 . These are in reasonable agreement with estimates from recent HST-images.\nWe show that synchrotron emission from a magnetized, relativistic, non-thermal particle\npopulation may explain the non-thermal spectral regions. Energetic electrons necessary for\nsynchrotron radiation may be produced through shocks or by magnetic reconnection out of\nthe pool of thermal particles, or may be Galactic cosmic rays.\nA stellar origin of the observed flux densities appears unlikely considering that the\nsources are extended. Thus magnetic fields, which have been neglected in ProPlyD models\nso far, are possibly associated with the ProPlyD envelopes or disks, and appear to be crucial\nin understanding the physical processes in these ProPlyD-like objects.\nMelnick et al. (1989) have shown that an inhomogeneous dust distribution in NGC 3603\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ncauses increasing extinction with distance from the star cluster. In particular, the extinction\nat the location of the ProPlyD-like objects is estimated to lie between AV \u2248 5 \u2212 6 mag.\nExtinction estimates derived from the radio- to H\u03b1-luminosity ratio are 1\u20132 magnitudes\nhigher.\nThe ultimate discovery of the so-far undetected disks, which are thought to be part of\nall ProPlyDs, would give important hints about the origin of the extremely high and nonthermal radio fluxes and the nature of the cometary-shaped clumps seen in NGC 3603. This\nmay be accomplished in future mm observations with an upgraded ATCA.\nWe are grateful to Wolfgang Brandner for providing the HST image of NGC 3603 to overlay on our radio images, for interesting discussions and carefully reading the manuscript.
