One frequently considered modification is to replace the\nRicci scalar, R, by some analytic function, f (R) (see e.g [1, 2, 3, 4]). Theories of this type are\nreferred to as fourth-order, as the field equations generated from them are generically fourthorder in derivatives of the metric. Motivations for such studies are found from various different\nsources. One often cited reason is that early attempts to create a perturbatively renormalizable\nquantum field theory of gravity found success by adding extra terms, quadratic in the Ricci\ncurvature, to the action [5]. More recently, the effective actions of some string theories have\nbeen shown to include higher-order curvature terms [6, 7]. Studies of f (R) theories have also\nbeen performed in cosmological settings, often in attempts to better understand the late-time\naccelerating expansion of the universe [8, 9], cosmological inflation [10, 11, 12] or the nature of\nan initial singularity [13, 14, 15].\nDifficulty can arise, in studies of fourth-order theories, as the field equations involved are\nconsiderably more complex than their counterparts in GR. This extra complexity brings new\nand interesting behaviour, such as violations of Birkhoff's theorem [16] or violations of the no\nhair theorems of de Sitter space, [12]. However, this extra complexity also makes it even more\ndifficult to find exact solutions of the field equations. Whilst some exact solutions have been\nfound in the spherically symmetric [16, 17] and cosmological [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25] situations,\nthese are all particular solutions. To date, there have been no general solutions published in\nthe literature, for any set of non-maximal symmetries. Exact solutions, and particularly exact\ngeneral solutions, are of great importance for understanding a theory. In this paper we will\npresent homogeneous and isotropic exact general solutions, obtained through direct integration\nof the field equations, to some fourth-order theories of gravity. We expect these solutions to\nbe of use for helping to understand fourth-order theories of gravity, and the evolution of the\nuniverses they govern.\nInvestigations of fourth-order theories usually follow one of two approaches: Either they\ntake the full-theory and look for approximate solutions, or they approximate the theory and\nlook for exact solutions. We will take the later approach and consider theories that have a\nLagrangian proportional to Rn . Such theories are scale invariant, and reduce to GR in the\nlimit n \u2192 1. These theories may be considered as the limit of a more general Lagrangian\nthat has a power of R dominating in some particular regime, or as a simple deviation from the\nstandard theory in their own right. We find that for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies\nthe field equations of these theories can often be integrated directly. For spatially flat vacuum\ncosmologies the general solution can be found for any n, for spatially curved vacuum cosmologies\nwe find the general solutions when n = 3/2, and for spatially flat perfect fluid cosmologies (with\nequation of state p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1) we find the general solutions when n = 3\u03b3/(3\u03b3 \u2212 1) and when\nn = (10 \u2212 3\u03b3)/(2(7 \u2212 3\u03b3)). These dependences are shown graphically in figure 1, below.\n\nInvestigations of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in Rn theories have been performed\nbefore in [17, 21]. In these papers the authors find power-law exact, particular solutions and\nperform a dynamical systems analysis of the phase space of more general solutions. These\nstudies show that the general solutions are often attracted to simple power-law solutions, at\n\n2\n\n\fn\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n-4\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u0393\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\nFigure 1: A plot of n = 3\u03b3/(3\u03b3 \u2212 1) (solid line) and n = (10 \u2212 3\u03b3)/(2(7 \u2212 3\u03b3)) (dashed line).\nFor these values of n the field equations for homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid cosmologies\ncan be integrated directly.\nboth late and early times. We will confirm this behaviour here, and add to the previous work\nby finding explicit expressions for the general evolution of these universes.\nWe will now comment on the extent to which the solutions found in this paper can be\nconsidered candidates for the description of our universe. It has been shown in [16] and [17] that\ngravitational theories derived from a Lagrangian of the form Rn are constrained by observations\nin our local universe to have n very close to 1. It has also been suggested (see e.g. [22], [23]) that\nit may not be possible for general f (R) theories of gravity to transition between eras dominated\nby different fluids in the same way that occurs in the usual general relativistic description.\nThese results suggest that our neighbourhood of space-time should be well described by a\ntheory that is very close to the Einstein-Hilbert one. However, with these constraints in mind,\nthere are still good reasons to be interested in deviations of the Rn form. Firstly, even if n is\nvery tightly constrained by local observations, any small deviation from n = 1 may produce\nsignificant deviations at early times in the universe's history. This will be shown explicitly\nbelow. Secondly, theories of the type R + \u03b1Rn are often considered in the literature. If n > 1\nthen we may expect the effective gravitational theory in the early universe to be well described\nby a Lagrangian of the form Rn . In such cases a more appropriate description of the evolution\nof the early universe would be given by an Rn theory, even though observations from our local\nuniverse show strong agreement with an effective theory of the Einstein-Hilbert type.\nThis paper will proceed as follows. In section 2 we will give the field equations for the\ntheory, and show how they can be simplified by recasting them in terms of new variables and\ntransforming time coordinates. Simple power-law exact, particular solutions to these equations\nare given. In section 3 we show how the field equations for vacuum cosmologies can be decoupled\nby a further transformation of variables. These equations are then integrated directly, and the\n3\n\n\fsolutions given explicitly in terms of the metric. Section 4 follows a similar prescription, this\ntime solving the field equations in the presence of a perfect fluid. In section 5 we perform a\nbrief analysis of the vacuum solutions, and in section 6 we analyse the perfect fluid solutions.\nSection 7 provides a closing discussion. For readers interested in the solutions, but not the\nderivations, the solutions in sections 3 and 4 are boxed to make them easily identifiable.\n\n2\n\nField equations\n\nWe consider here a gravitational theory derived from the Lagrangian density\nLG =\n\n1\u221a\n\u2212gR1+\u03b4 ,\n\u03c7\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is a real number and \u03c7 is a constant. The limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 gives the Einstein-Hilbert\nLagrangian of GR, and we are interested in isotropic and homogeneous cosmological solutions\nwith \u03b4 6= 0. Theories of this kind are dynamically equivalent to scalar-tensor theories (see e.g.\n[24]).\nWe denote the matter action as Sm and ignore the boundary term.

We take the quantity R\u03b4 to be the positive real root of |R|.\n\nWe are concerned with idealised homogeneous and isotropic space-times described by the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker metric with spatial curvature parameter \u03ba:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndr 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(3)\nds = \u2212dt + a (t)\n+ r d\u03b8 + r sin \u03b8d\u03c6 .\n(1 \u2212 \u03bar 2 )\n\nSubstituting this metric ansatz into the field equations (2), and assuming the universe to be\nfilled with a perfect fluid of pressure p and density \u03c1, gives the generalised version of the\nFriedmann equations\n!\n2\nR\u0308\n\u0227 \u1e58\n\u03c7\n2\n\u03b4 \u1e58\n1+\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u2212 3\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b4 )R 2 = (\u03c1 \u2212 3p)\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)R\n+ 3\u03b4(1 + \u03b4)R\n+3\n(4)\nR\naR\nR\n2\n\u00e4\nR1+\u03b4\n\u0227 \u1e58 \u03b4 \u03c7\n\u22123 (1 + \u03b4)R\u03b4 +\n+ 3\u03b4(1 + \u03b4)\nR = \u03c1\na\n2\naR\n2\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere, as usual,\n\n\u00e4\n\u02272\n\u03ba\nR = 6 + 6 2 + 6 2.\n(6)\na\na\na\nIt can be seen that in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 these equations reduce to the standard Friedmann\nequations of GR. A study of the vacuum solutions to these equations has been made by Schmidt,\nsee the review [20], and a study of the perfect-fluid evolution has been made by Carloni et al\n[21]. In [17] Clifton and Barrow investigated solutions when \u03ba = 0, and showed that attractor\npower-law solutions exist. Various conclusions are also immediate from the general analysis\nof f (R) Lagrangians made in [3] by specialising them to the case f = R1+\u03b4 . These previous\nstudies have focussed on the existence of particular exact solutions, or qualitative investigations\nof the phase space of general solutions. In what follows we shall be interested in determining\nthe general evolution of a in terms of explicit, exact solutions. This should lead to fresh insights\ninto the evolution of universes described by these theories.\nAssuming a perfect-fluid equation of state of the form p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1, the usual conservation\nequation gives \u03c1 = \u03c10 a\u22123\u03b3 . Substituting this into equations (4) and (5), with \u03ba = 0, gives the\nparticular power-law exact Friedmann solution, for \u03b3 6= 0,\na(t) = t\n\n2(1+\u03b4)\n3\u03b3\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nAlternatively, if \u03b3 = 0, there exists the de Sitter solution a(t) = emt . These power-law solutions\nreduce to the usual general relativistic solutions in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. Furthermore, the power-law\nsolutions\n\u03b4(1+2\u03b4)\n(8)\na(t) = t (1\u2212\u03b4)\nand\n\n1\n\na(t) = t 2\n\n(9)\n\nalso exist. These solutions are independent of \u03b3, and therefore of the matter content of the\nuniverse. The \u03b4 = 0 limit of (8) clearly corresponds to Minkowski space. These three particular\nsolutions were both shown in [17] to be attractors of the spatially flat general solution, under\ncertain conditions. In what follows we will be able to show this attractor explicitly in terms of\nexact general solutions.\nThe equations (4), (5) and (6) can be cast in a simpler form by defining the new variables\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand\n\u0101 \u2261 e\u03c6/2 3 a.\n\u03c6 \u2261 3 ln R\u03b4\nTransforming to the time coordinate\n\u221a\n\nd\u03b7 \u2261 e\u03c6/2 3 dt\nand setting \u03c7 = 1 we then have two second-order evolution equations, for the two variables \u0101\nand \u03c6,\n \u0308\n\u0101\n(2 \u2212 3\u03b3)\u03c10 \u221a3(\u03b3\u22124/3)\u03c6/2\n6 = \u2212\u03c6\u03072 + V0 e\u2212\u03bb +\ne\n3\u03b3\n\u0101\n2\u0101\n\u221a\n\u0101 \u0307\n3(\u03b3 \u2212 4/3)\u03c10 \u221a3(\u03b3\u22124/3)\u03c6/2\n\u2212\u03bb\u03c6\n\u2212\ne\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3 \u03c6\u0307 = \u03bbV0 e\n\u0101\n2\u01013\u03b3\n5\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\fand the constraint equation\n6\nwhere\n\n\u0101 \u0307 2\n\u03c6\u03072\n\u03ba\n\u03c10 \u221a3(\u03b3\u22124/3)\u03c6/2\n\u2212\u03bb\u03c6\n=\n+\nV\ne\n\u2212\n+\ne\n0\n\u01012\n2\n\u01012 \u01013\u03b3\n\n\u03b4\nsign(R)\n(1 + \u03b4)\n\n(12)\n\n(\u03b4 \u2212 1)\n.\n\u03bb= \u221a\n3\u03b4\nOver-dots here denote differentiation with respect to \u03b7. In rescaling time in this way we must\nremember that the more physically significant cosmological time coordinate t may diverge at\nfinite values of the new time coordinate. In such cases we will consider t as the more physically\nmeaningful time, and allow the new coordinate to take values only over an appropriate range.\nThis set of equations is similar to those obtained in GR, when considering homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmologies with a scalar field in an exponential potential, and a perfect fluid. This\nsimilarity is due to the conformal equivalence between f (R) theories of gravity and GR (see e.g.\n[25, 26, 27]). One should notice, however, that the terms corresponding to the perfect fluid have\na more complicated form than may have otherwise been obtained in GR (except for the special\ncase of black-body radiation, \u03b3 = 4/3, which is conformally invariant). The corresponding set\nof equations in GR has been solved in vacuum by Russo [28], and in the presence of a perfect\nfluid by Dehnen, Gavrilov and Melnikov [29].\nV0 =\n\n3\n\nand\n\nVacuum solutions\n\n3.1\n\nSpatially flat solutions\n\nIn the absence of any matter fields the equations (10) and (11) are identical to homogeneous\nand isotropic general relativistic cosmologies, with a scalar field in an exponential potential.\nThe spatially flat general solutions to these equations have already been found by Russo [28].\nHere we will briefly reiterate the method of solving these equations, and use the results to find\nthe general solution to spatially flat vacuum cosmologies in Rn gravity.\nFirstly, making the transformation of variables {a, \u03c6} \u2192 {u, v} by the definitions\nr\n4\n3\nv+u\n\u0101 \u2261 e\nand\n\u03c6\u2261\n(v \u2212 u)\n3\nand defining the new time coordinate\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03b7 \u2261 e 2 \u03c6 d\u03c4\nallows the evolution equations (10) and (11) to be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\n3V0\n\u03bb\n2\nv\u0308 + 1 \u2212 \u221a v\u0307 \u2212\n1+ \u221a\n=0\n8\n3\n3\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n3V0\n2\n1\u2212 \u221a\n\u00fc + 1 + \u221a u\u0307 \u2212\n=0\n8\n3\n3\n6\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\fwhere over-dots now denote differentiation with respect to \u03c4 .

The special cases\nof \u03b4 = \u22121/2 and \u03b4 = 1/4 will be investigated in the appendix. These solutions contain a number\nof constants, as a result of integrating the field equations. The physical significance of these\nconstants varies: In some cases they can be absorbed into a rescaling of coordinates, in others\nthey cannot and must be specified by initial conditions2 . If the latter is the case, then these\nconstants are physically meaningful quantities and their value is important for the evolution of\nthe space-time. We will describe the effect of taking different values for these constants in the\nanalysis below.\n\n5.1\n\nSpatially flat cosmologies\n\nWe begin with the spatially flat solution (19). In the case c11 = 0 the solution (19) can be\nwritten as\n4(\u03b4\u22121)\n\n4\u03b4\n\nds2 = \u2212e\u2212 (4\u03b4\u22121)(2\u03b4+1) \u03c4 d\u03c4 2 + e (4\u03b4\u22121) \u03c4 dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + t\n\n2\u03b4(1+2\u03b4)\n(1\u2212\u03b4)\n\ndx2 ,\n\nwhich is simply the power-law solution (8). It can be seen directly from (19) that for all c11\nthis simple solution is the attractor as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e.\n\nWhen c11 = 0 the power-law solution above describes the evolution of the universe all\nthe way back to the initial singularity, but for c11 6= 0 more general behaviour occurs as the\nsingularity is approached. The form of this early-time behaviour depends upon the sign of c11\n(recall that the magnitude of c11 can be absorbed into coordinate redefinitions).\n2\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon, and can be shown to be the case in, for example, the general Friedmann\nsolutions of Brans-Dicke theory [30].\n\n13\n\n\fFor c11 > 0 a power series expansion of the metric gives\n2\n\n4\u03b4\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 (4\u03b4\u22121) d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 (4\u03b4\u22121) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2\nwhen \u03c4 \u2212 21 log(c11 ) \u226a 1. This limit is the same as the power-law exact solution (9).\nFor c11 < 0 a similar expansion about\n\n1\n2\n\nlog(\u2212c11 ) gives\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b4\n2\nds \u2243 \u2212\u03c4\nd\u03c4 + 1 +\n\u03c4\ndx2\n(4\u03b4 \u2212 1)\n\u0012\n\u00132\n(1+2\u03b4)\n\u03b4\n2\nt \u03b4\n= \u2212dt + 1 +\ndx2 .\n(4\u03b4 \u2212 1)\n2\n\n\u22122\n(1+2\u03b4)\n\n2\n\nThis solution is clearly quite different from the power-law limits that have been found so far. For\n\u03b4 > 1/4 or < 0 it corresponds to a non-zero minimum of expansion, or bounce. For 0 < \u03b4 < 1/4\nit is a maximum of expansion. It should be noted that when \u22121/2 < \u03b4 < 0 the power of t in the\nscale factor diverges as t \u2192 0. In this case there is no staticity, and the scale-factor diverges as\nt \u2192 0. Bounces occur here without any violation of energy conditions, as there are no matter\nfields present to commit such violations. The bounce is entirely due to the vacuum dynamics\nof the theory.\nWe have now shown both the early and late-time behaviour of the solution (19). At latetimes all solutions approach the power-law exact particular solution (8). At early-times the\nevolution of the universe is qualitatively different depending upon the value of the constant\nc11 . For c11 = 0 the solution (8) is valid all the way back to the initial singularity. For\nc11 > 0 the general solution has an early period of expansion of the form of (9), in the vicinity\nof the singularity. The expansion then evolves into the late-time attractor. When c11 < 0\nthere is a non-zero minimum of expansion (or maximum if 0 < \u03b4 < 1/4, or divergence if\n\u22121/2 < \u03b4 < 0). The universe then evolves from this static past towards the late-time attractor.\nSome representative evolutions of the scale-factor, in terms of the proper time coordinate t, are\nshown in figure 2.\nWe will now investigate the solution (18). Firstly, expanding around the point \u03c4 = 0 we get\nthe approximation\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n4\u03b4\n\u2212 (1+2\u03b4)\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c4\ndx2\nds \u2243 \u2212\u03c4\nd\u03c4 + 1 \u2212\n(4\u03b4 \u2212 1)\n\u0012\n\u00132\n(1+2\u03b4)\n4\u03b4\n2\n= \u2212dt + 1 \u2212\ndx2 ,\nt \u03b4\n(4\u03b4 \u2212 1)\nwhen \u03c4 \u226a 1. This is remarkably similar to the form of the previous metric, (19), in the vicinity\nof its minimum of expansion. A noticeable difference is the sign before the second term in the\nbrackets. This change in sign shows that when the previous solution was a minimum (\u03b4 > 1/4\nor < \u22121/2) this solution is a maximum of expansion. Correspondingly, when the previous\nsolution was a maximum (0 < \u03b4 < 1/4), this solution is a minimum. Again, there is divergence\nwhen \u22121/2 < \u03b4 < 0.\n14\n\n\fa\n\nt\nFigure 2: The evolution of the scale factor of solution (19) in terms of proper time, t. The value\nof \u03b4 chosen here is 1/2. The solid line corresponds to c11 = 0, or the power-law exact solution\n(8). The dotted line corresponds to c11 > 0 and shows an early period of t1/2 expansion, that\nis attracted towards (8) at later times. The dashed line corresponds to c11 < 0 and shows a\nnon-zero minimum of expansion, and subsequent evolution towards (8).\nWe will now investigate the form of (18) around \u03c4 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. Performing a power series\nexpansion about either of these points gives\n4\u03b4\n\n2\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 (4\u03b4\u22121) d\u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03c4 (4\u03b4\u22121) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2 ,\nwhen \u03c4 \u2213 \u03c0/2 \u226a 1. In the vicinity of both of these points the evolution of (19) is therefore of\nthe form of the power-law exact solution (9).\nWe have shown that the evolution of the solution (18) depends upon the sign of \u03b4. When\n\u03b4 > 1/4 or < \u22121/2 the solution, in terms of proper time t, has a maximum of expansion with its\n1\nearly and late-time evolution going as t 2 . When 0 < \u03b4 < 1/4 there is a minimum of expansion,\nand late and early-time expansion again goes as t1/2 . For \u22121/2 < \u03b4 < 0 the solution diverges\nin the region which is static for all other values of \u03b4. The form of some representative solutions\nare shown in figure 3. The behaviour of these solutions are markedly different from those found\nby Russo [28]. Although a late-time power-law attractor can still be seen to exist in one of the\nsolutions, very little else is comparable.\n\n5.2\n\nSpatially curved cosmologies\n\nFor spatially curved vacuum universes we found the general solutions (20) and Milne space,\nwhen \u03b4 = 1/2. The existence of Milne space as a solution should not be surprising, as any Ricci\n15\n\n\fa\n\nt\nFigure 3: The evolution of the scale factor of solution (18) in terms of proper time, t. The solid\nline corresponds to \u03b4 = 1, the dashed line to \u03b4 = 1/8 and the dotted line to \u03b4 = \u22122.\nflat solution of GR in a vacuum is also a solution of the field equations (2) in vacuum (at least\nwhen \u03b4 > 0). We will now investigate the form of the solution (20).\nWhen \u03ba = 0 this solution reduces to\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + t4 dx2 ,\nwhich corresponds to the power-law particular solution (8), when \u03b4 = 1/2. When \u03ba 6= 0 we see\nthat this solution exhibits new behaviour, dependent on the value of \u03ba and which branch of the\n\u00b1 sign is chosen.\n\nWhen \u03ba > 0 and c17 > 0, then in the vicinity of t = 0 this solution exhibits a maximum\nof expansion. Subsequent evolution of the scale-factor, as t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, depends upon the chosen\nbranch. Taking the positive branch we see that the universe can start to expand again, as\n|t| increases. The existence of this expansion phase depends upon the magnitude of c17 . If\nc17 6 \u03ba2 /4 then the effect of the second term in the scale-factor is too great and the universe\ncollapses to a singularity, before the t4 term can become dominant. When c17 > \u03ba2 /4 the\nt4 term dominates the late-time evolution and the power-law solution (8) is approached, as\n|t| \u2192 \u221e. When the negative branch is taken then the maximum of expansion at t = 0 always\nleads to collapse to a singularity, as t either increases or decreases.\nWhen \u03ba < 0 and c17 = 0 then there exists an initial singularity, with the evolution of the\nscale factor in its immediate vicinity expanding proportionally to t. The late-time evolution of\nsuch solutions will be attracted to either the power-law solution (8), if the positive branch is\nchosen, or to eventual collapse to singularity, if the negative branch is chosen. The case c17 > 0\ndoes not have a singularity at t = 0, but instead has a minimum of expansion, or bounce. The\nevolution away from this minimum proceeds as in the c17 = 0 case. The c17 < 0 case again\nfeatures an initial singularity and displays approximately the same evolution as when c17 = 0\n16\n\n\f(a notable deviation is that the period of a \u221d t expansion near the singularity is absent if c17\nis sufficiently negative).\nWe have shown that when \u03ba 6= 0 there exists a minimum of expansion when c17 > 0, and\nan initial singularity when c17 6 0. Initial evolution away from an early minimum proceeds\nas a \u221d t, either expanding or collapsing, depending on the sign of \u03ba. If there is an initial\nsingularity, then evolution away from it proceeds as a \u221d t, unless c17 is sufficiently negative (in\nwhich case the t4 term dominates right from the beginning). The late-time evolution of these\nsolutions is dominated by the t4 term in (20). The negative branch of this term causes collapse\nto a singularity, and the positive branch leads to asymptotic expansion and approach towards\nthe power-law solution (8) (unless the term proportional to \u03ba causes collapse to singularity\nbefore the t4 becomes dominant). The form of some representative solutions are shown in\nfigure 4.\n\na\n\nt\nFigure 4: The evolution of the scale factor of solution (20) in terms of proper time, t. The\nsolid lines correspond to universes with \u03ba > 0, dashed lines to those with \u03ba < 0 and the dotted\nline to \u03ba = 0. Those solutions starting from the origin have c17 = 0, and those starting from\na non-zero minimum have c17 > 0. All solutions collapsing to singularity correspond to the\nnegative branch of t4 , and all solutions expanding at late-times to the positive branch. See the\nmain body of text for an explanation of these different behaviours.\n\n6\n\nAnalysis of perfect fluid cosmologies\n\nWe will now analyse the evolution of universes described by the perfect fluid solutions (22),\n(23), (24) and (25). Again, these solutions contain a number of constants, some of which\ncan be absorbed into coordinate redefinitions and some of which cannot. We will explain the\nsignificance of such constants below.\n17\n\n\f6.1\n\n\u03b4 = 1/(3\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\nWhen \u03b4 = 1/(3\u03b3 \u22121) we found from direct integration of the field equations the general solutions\n(22) and (23). We will first consider (22).\nThe form of the scale factor in this solution depends upon which of the two terms in the\nbrackets is dominant. When the first term dominates the metric is approximately given by\n\u2212 6(1+4\u03b3\u22123\u03b3\n\n2)\n\n2\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 (5\u22123\u03b3)(1+3\u03b3) d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 (5\u22123\u03b3)(1+3\u03b3) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2 ,\nwhich corresponds to the power-law particular solution (9). When the second term in the\nbrackets dominates we have\n6(1+7\u03b3\u22126\u03b3 2 )\n\n2\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 \u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3)(1+3\u03b3) + \u03c4 (5\u22123\u03b3)(1+3\u03b3) dx2\n2(1+3\u03b3)\n\n= \u2212dt2 + t (2\u22123\u03b3)(1\u22123\u03b3) dx2 ,\nwhich corresponds to the vacuum dominated, power-law particular solution (8). It now remains\nto investigate the conditions under which each of these approximations dominates, at early and\nlate times.\nWhen c23 = 0, and \u03b3 > 0, then the first term always dominates as \u03c4 \u2192 0, and the universe\n1\nevolves like a \u223c t 2 . As \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e the second term dominates, and the evolution of the universe is\nattracted towards the form of (8).\nWhen c23 6= 0, and \u03b3 > 0, then this has the effect of offsetting the origin of the second term\nrelative to the first. The second term will then be the dominant one for most of the range of \u03c4 ,\nwith a contribution expected from the first term in the vicinity of \u03c4 = \u2212c23 .\n\nPhantom fluids, with \u03b3 < 0, have the same behaviour as outlined above, but with the\ndominance of the two terms reversed in each case.\nWe will now consider the solution (23). The evolution of this space-time again depends on\nwhich of the two terms in the brackets is dominant. If the first term dominates then the metric\nlook like\n6(1\u2212\u03b3)\n\n2\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 \u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 (5\u22123\u03b3) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2 ,\nwhich is again the power-law evolution (9). We will call this vacuum domination, as it corresponds to evolution being dominated by a term independent of \u03c10 . If the second term in\nbrackets dominates then we now have\n12(1\u2212\u03b3)\n\n4\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4 \u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 (5\u22123\u03b3) dx2\n4\n\n= \u2212dt2 + t (3\u03b3\u22121) dx2 ,\n\nwhich corresponds to the matter dominated power-law expansion (7). We must now investigate\nthe conditions under which each of these approximations dominates. This will depend upon\nthe value of the constants c24 and c25 .\n18\n\n\fWhen c24 = c25 = 0 we see that the matter dominated power-law expansion (7) holds all\nthe way back to the initial singularity. If c24 = 0 and c25 6= 0, then there is an initial period of\n1\nvacuum dominated expansion of the form a \u221d t 2 and a late-time evolution towards the matter\ndominated power-law solution (7). If c24 6= 0 then this has the effect of offsetting the origin\nof first term in the brackets, relative to the second. This can result in a non-zero minimum\nof expansion (depending on the signs of c24 and c25 ), as in this case the first term can both\ndominate and be non-zero at \u03c4 = 0. As |\u03c4 | \u2192 \u221e the matter dominated power-law solution (7)\nis then approached.\n\n6.2\n\n\u03b4 = \u2212(4 \u2212 3\u03b3)/(2(7 \u2212 3\u03b3))\n\nWe will now investigate the solutions (24) and (25), obtained by integrating the field equations\nin the presence of a perfect fluid when \u03b4 = \u2212(4 \u2212 3\u03b3)/(2(7 \u2212 3\u03b3)).\n6.2.1\n\n5 \u2212 3\u03b3 > 0\n\nWe will first consider the solution {a1 , b1 }. Expanding this solution around the points \u03c4 = n\u03c0\nand \u03c4 = c29 + n\u03c0, where n is an integer, gives the evolution of the scale factor in their vicinity.\nTo first order, an expansion about \u03c4 = n\u03c0 results in\nds2 \u2243 \u2212\u03c4\n\n(4\u22123\u03b3)(1\u2212\u03b3)\n(5\u22123\u03b3)\n\n(4\u22123\u03b3)\n\nd\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 \u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) dx2\n\n2(4\u22123\u03b3)\n\n= \u2212dt2 + t 3(7\u22123\u03b3)(\u03b3\u22122) dx2 ,\nwhich corresponds to the vacuum dominated power-law expansion, (8). A similar expansion\nabout \u03c4 = c29 + n\u03c0 gives\n2(7\u22123\u03b3)\n\n2\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212(\u03c4 \u2212 c29 )\u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) d\u03c4 2 + (\u03c4 \u2212 c29 )\u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2 ,\nwhich is the power-law evolution described by (9). Whether or not these points correspond to\na curvature singularity depends upon the value of \u03b3, and can be read off from the Ricci scalar\n\u001a\n\u001b\n(2\u2212\u03b3)(7\u22123\u03b3)\n2(7\u22123\u03b3)\n6(10 \u2212 3\u03b3)\n6\n\u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3)\n(5\u22123\u03b3)\nR=\n{\u03c4 \u2212 c29 } sin\nsin\n\u03c4 .\n(5 \u2212 3\u03b3)(4 \u2212 3\u03b3)\n(4 \u2212 3\u03b3)\n\nWe see that when \u03b3 > 7/3 the Ricci scalar remains finite for all \u03c4 , whilst for 2 < \u03b3 < 7/3 or\n\u03b3 < 5/3 the Ricci scalar diverges to infinity every time \u03c4 = (4 \u2212 3\u03b3)n\u03c0/6. The evolution of\na(t) in the vicinity of these singularities goes like (8). Similarly, when 5/3 < \u03b3 < 7/3 there are\n1\ncurvature singularities at \u03c4 = c29 + n\u03c0. In the vicinity of these singularities a(t) \u223c t 2 . These\nlatter singularities correspond to a(t) \u2192 0, whereas the former correspond to the divergence\na(t) \u2192 \u221e (except in the range 4/3 < \u03b3 < 5/3, in which case a(t) \u2192 0).\n\nAn instructive special case to consider is that of pressureless dust, \u03b3 = 0. In this case the\ncoordinate transformation t = cot(\u03c4 \u2212 c29 ) allows the metric to be recast as\n\u221a\nt2 + 1\n2\n2\ndx2 .\nds = \u2212dt +\n1\n\u22121\n6\nsin {6(c29 + cot {t})}\n19\n\n\f1\n\nIt can now be seen directly that a(t) \u2192 t 2 as t \u2192 \u221e (or \u03c4 \u2192 c29 + n\u03c0), and diverges to \u221e as\n(8) when t \u2192 \u2212 cot{c29 \u2212 n\u03c0/6} (or \u03c4 \u2192 n\u03c0/6).\nWe will now consider the solution {a2 , b2 }. In the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e this solution approaches\n4\u03c4\n\n8\u03c4\n\nds2 \u2243 \u2212e\u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) d\u03c4 2 + e\u2212 (5\u22123\u03b3) dx2\n= \u2212dt2 + tdx2 ,\nwhich is the power-law solution (9). When \u03c4 \u2192 0 we see that we have the same limit as in the\nprevious solution, where the power-law evolution (8) is approached. Similarly, as \u03c4 \u2192 c29 we\n1\napproach the power-law evolution a \u223c t 2 , (9). The conditions for whether or not these limits\ncorrespond to singularities, and if these singularities correspond to a(t) \u2192 0 or a(t) \u2192 \u221e, have\nexactly the same dependence on \u03b3 as with the previous solution.\nThe pressureless dust case is again instructive, and can be written in terms of proper time,\nby making the transformation t = coth{c29 \u2212 \u03c4 }, as\n\u221a\nt2 \u2212 1\n2\n2\nds = \u2212dt +\ndx2 .\n1\n\u22121\n6\nsinh {6(c29 \u2212 coth {t})}\n1\n\nThis solution displays t 2 evolution as t \u2192 \u221e, and divergence to \u221e as t \u2192 coth{c29 }.\n\nThe solution {a3 , b3 } will now be considered. The late-time evolution of this solution is the\nsame as in the previous case. The evolution about \u03c4 = c is also the same. Now, however, we no\nlonger have the singular behaviour about \u03c4 = 0 that previously existed. Instead the scale-factor\n1\nevolves as a \u223c a0 + t 2 in the vicinity of this point, where a0 is some constant. The dust solution\nin this case is then\n\u221a\nt2 \u2212 1\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\ndx2 ,\n1\n\u22121\n6\ncosh {6(c30 \u2212 coth {t})}\nwhere t = coth{c30 \u2212 \u03c4 }. This metric has a scale factor that no longer diverges at any finite t.\n\n6.2.2\n\n5 \u2212 3\u03b3 < 0\n1\n\nThe late-time evolution of these two solutions is of the form a \u223c t 2 , as with the previous two\nsolutions. Now, the form of solution {a4 , b4 } about \u03c4 = 0 displays the same divergences as {a2 ,\n1\nb2 }. Evolution towards the point \u03c4 = c is non-singular, and goes as a \u223c a0 + t 2 . The special\ncase of pressureless dust is given in this case, in terms of proper time t, by\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 t2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212dt +\ndx2 ,\n1\n\u22121\nsinh 6 {6(c31 + tanh {t})}\nwhere t = tanh{\u03c4 \u2212 c31 }. The scale-factor here can be seen to vanish at t = \u00b11 (corresponding\nto \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e), and to diverge to \u221e at t = tanh{\u2212c31 }. The evolution of the scale factor follows\nthe late-time attractor towards the points at t = \u00b11.\n\nWe will now consider the remaining solution, {a5 , b5 }. This solution behaves as the solution\n{a3 , b3 } in the vicinity of \u03c4 = 0, and as {a4 , b4 } in the vicinity of \u03c4 = c. That is, about both of\n20\n\n\f1\n\nthese points the evolution of the scale factor goes as a \u223c a0 + t 2 and is non-singular. In fact,\nat no finite \u03c4 does this solution become singular. The pressureless dust solution is given here,\nin terms of proper time, as\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 t2\ndx2 ,\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\n1\n\u22121\n6\ncosh {6(c32 + tanh {t})}\nwhere t = tanh{\u03c4 \u2212 c32 }. This solution describes a space-time that evolves from a = 0 at\nt = \u22121 (corresponding to \u03c4 = \u2212\u221e) to a = 0 at t = 1 (corresponding to \u03c4 = \u221e). The evolution\nbetween these two end points is at all times finite.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have investigated the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions of Rn theories.\nIt has been shown that in a number of cases the field equations can be integrated directly,\nallowing the general behaviour of these models to be found. For spatially flat vacuum universes\nthe solutions for any n can be found. For spatially curved vacuum universes, and flat perfect\nfluid universes, the general solutions can be obtained for various particular values of n. These\nsolutions were given explicitly in sections 3 and 4. It is interesting to note that unlike the\ngeneral relativistic cosmologies, vacuum solutions can be either open, closed or flat. It was\nalso found that there is generically not one unique solution for any given n, matter content\nand topology, as there usually is in GR. This was found previously in [17, 21], where a phase\nplane analysis showed an invariant sub-manifold in the phase space of solutions which could\nnot be crossed by any trajectory. This result is reiterated here, where we find multiple ways\nto integrate the field equations, yielding multiple solutions. It was also shown in [17, 21] that\nthe form of the general solution changes with n: Critical points in the phase space change their\nattractor nature as n is varied. Again, we confirm this result by finding explicit solutions for\ncosmologies with the same topology and matter content, but different n. These solutions have\nclearly different forms. In sections 5 and 6 we performed a brief analysis of the vacuum and\nperfect fluid solutions, respectively. The evolution of these universes, in terms of proper time,\nwere found in different regimes. The nature of the initial singularity was investigated, or its\nlack thereof, as well as evolution at late-times. In summary, it was found that great variety is\npresent in the cosmologies of these theories. Behaviour at both late and early times can vary\nwildly, depending on n, and even between different solutions with the same n, matter content\nand topology. Solutions can manifest initially singular or non-singular behaviour, and late-time\nevolution can either lead to a crunch or to monotonic expansion.\n\n21\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank John Barrow for helpful discussions and suggestions, and to acknowledge the support of the Lindemann trust.\n\nA\n\nVacuum \u03b4 = \u22121/2 cosmologies\n\nWe will now describe the evolution of universes described by the solution (16). Taking the\npositive branch of (16) we see that as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e we have d\u03c4 \u226a dt, so that in terms of proper\ntime the universe evolves very slowly at late-times. However, for the negative branch of (16)\nwe see that d\u03c4 \u226b dt in this limit. For the negative branch, therefore, we should expect\nincreasingly rapid evolution at late times, and for the positive branch an evolution towards an\nasymptotic steady state. A power series expansion of (16) shows that the early-time behaviour\nof both branches goes like the power-law particular solution (9). Figure 5 shows graphically\nthe evolution of the two branches of this solution.\n\na\n\nt\nFigure 5: The evolution of the scale factor of solution (16) in terms of proper time, t. The solid\nlines correspond to the positive branch, and the dashed line to the negative branch.\n\nB\n\nVacuum \u03b4 = 1/4 cosmologies\n\nWe will now describe the evolution of universes described by the solution (17). A power series\nexpansion of this solution shows that the scale factors of both branches approach a stationary\nstate, in terms proper time t, as \u03c4 \u2192 0. We can then see that as \u03c4 increases the positive\nbranch expands out of this stationary state, and the negative branch collapses out of it. The\n22\n\n\fpositive branch therefore corresponds to an expanding universe evolving out of a bounce, and\nthe negative universe to an initially expanding universe with a maximum of expansion and\nsubsequent collapse. Figure 6 shows the evolution of the two branches of this solution.\n\na\n\nt\nFigure 6: The evolution of the scale factor of solution (17) in terms of proper time, t.
