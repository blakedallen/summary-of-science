Using the geometry of their complements, we classify\nsuch links up to five components. Every two-bridge knot complement is covered by a\ngreat circle link complement. We show that for roughly half of all two-bridge knots,\nthis cover contains a closed incompressible surface. Infinitely many fillings of the twobridge knot lift to fillings of the great circle link where the incompressibility of this\nsurface is preserved. It has been shown in [HT85] that only finitely many fillings of a\ntwo-bridge knot produce Haken manifolds. A closed manifold is said to be virtually\nHaken if has a finite cover that is Haken, but is not itself Haken. Thus, infinitely\nmany fillings of an infinite class of two-bridge knot complements are explicitly shown\nto be virtually Haken.\n\niv\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\nKnots and links are integral in the study of three-manifolds. For example, we know\nthat every closed three-manifold can be written as Dehn surgery on a link in S 3\n[Lic62]. Here we study a subclass of links, great circle links, where every component\nof the link is a geodesic in the standard metric on S 3 . This class of links has very\nnatural connections to other areas of mathematics. We hope to show that it is also\nvery beautiful in its own right.\n\n1.1\n\nGeodesics in the three-sphere\n\nFirst we claim that every geodesic g in S 3 is the intersection of a plane in R4 with\nthe unit three-sphere. Let x, y be two points on g, close enough together so that\na geodesic between them is unique. Then the reflection of R4 though any 3-plane\nthat contains x, y and the origin in R4 induces an isometry on S 3 that fixes x and y.\nTherefore this isometry fixes g. Hence g is in every such 3-plane, and in the unique\ntwo-plane through x,y and the origin in R4 . The intersection of this 2-plane and S 3\nis a curve on S 3 which we call a great circle. This and the general theory of the\ngeometry of the three-sphere can be found in the excellent survey, [Sco83a].\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nThe author knows of no previous efforts to classify great circle links using their\ncomplements in S 3 . However, great circle links have been studied fairly extensively\nin other contexts. For example, a great circle in S 3 is invariant under the action\nof \u03c6 : S 3 \u2192 S 3 by \u03c6(x) = \u2212x. Therefore, a great circle link of n components\n\ncorresponds to a configuration of n lines in RP3 . Configurations of lines in RP3 have\nbeen classified, up to 6 components, by Viro and Drobotukhina in [VD89], using\ntotally different, combinatorial methods.\nIn addition, since every geodesic is naturally identified with a plane through the\norigin, a link of p great circles corresponds to p points in the Grassmanian of twoplanes in R4 , G(4, 2). In [CHS96], Conway, Hardin, and Sloan investigate packings\nof G(m, n). For G(4, 2) they find a configuration of six points that corresponds to a\ngreat circle link with remarkable symmetry properties. Namely, every two circles can\nbe taken to any other two through an orientation-preserving symmetry.\nIn chapter 2, we classify great circle links up to five components. In general we\ntake the geometric point of view given in [Thu97] as the set-up for the classification.\n\n1.2\n\nConnections with rational knots\n\nWe also relate great circle links to rational knots. A two-bridge knot is a knot that\ncan be isotoped to have two minima and two maxima, and no less, with respect\nto the standard height function on R3 . By Schubert [Sch56] every two-bridge knot\ncan be put in a standard position, consisting of two arcs of slope p/q connecting\npunctures on a four-punctured sphere. In this way a two-bridge knot is associated\nwith a (non-unique) rational number. Thus we will use the term \"rational knot\"\ninterchangeably with \"two-bridge knot\". A sketch of Schubert's proof, from a slightly\ndifferent perspective, is given in section 3.4.\nAn incompressible surface S \u2282 M is an embedded surface S 6= S 2 in a three-\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nmanifold M where no non-trivial embedded curve on S bounds an embedded disk D\nin M, with D \u2229 S = \u2202D. An orientable irreducible three-manifold that contains an\nincompressible surface is called Haken. Haken manifolds are a very well-understood\nclass of three-manifolds. Using Haken's notion of a hierarchy, Waldhausen [Wal68]\nshowed that Haken manifolds are characterized by their fundamental groups. Specifically, let M and N be irreducible 3-manifolds where any boundary components are\nincompressible and M is Haken. If \u03c6 : \u03c01 (N) \u2192 \u03c01 (M) is an isomorphism that respects the peripheral structure, then \u03c6 is induced by a homeomorphism f : N \u2192 M.\n(\u03c6 respects the peripheral structure if for every boundary component F \u2282 N, the\nsubgroup of \u03c01 (N) corresponding to the inclusion of \u03c01 (F ) is mapped to a subgroup\nthat is conjugate to the inclusion of the fundamental group of a boundary component\nof M. ) W. Thurston also showed that Haken manifolds satisfy his geometrization\nconjecture. Namely, Haken manifolds can be cut along incompressible tori so that\neach piece is either a Seifert fibered space or a hyperbolic 3-manifold. A proof of this\ncan be found in the book detailing the proof on the Smith Conjecture, [Smi84].\nHowever, not all manifolds are Haken. In [HT85], Hatcher and Thurston showed\nthat all but finitely many fillings of rational knot complements are non-Haken. We say\nthat a manifold is virtually Haken if it is not itself Haken, but has a finite cover that\nis Haken. If manifold is virtually Haken then it maintains some of the nice properties\nof Haken manifolds. Most significantly, it still satisfies the geometrization conjecture.\nThe idea of the proof is roughly as follows. Let M \u2032 be a Haken cover of a non-Haken\nmanifold M. The set of incompressible tori in M \u2032 can be isotoped to be invariant\nunder the covering transformations, so M \u2032 cannot contain any incompressible tori\nsince M is non-Haken. Therefore, M \u2032 is either Seifert fibered or a hyperbolic manifold.\nThe case when M \u2032 is Seifert fibered follows from [Sco83b].\nIf M \u2032 is hyperbolic, then Mostow's rigidity theorem implies that the group of\nouter isomorphisms of \u03c01 (M \u2032 ) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the group of isometries\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n4\n\nof M \u2032 [Thub]. We may assume that M \u2032 is a regular cover of M after passing to finite\ncover, which will still be hyperbolic. Then any element g of \u03c01 (M) not in \u03c01 (M \u2032 )\ntakes \u03c01 (M \u2032 ) to itself under conjugation, and hence is identified with an isometry of\nM \u2032 . Therefore there is a hyperbolic orbifold N that has fundamental group \u03c01 (M).\nN is a actually a manifold because N is a K(\u03c01 (M), 1), and the fundamental group\nof such a complex has no torsion unless the complex is infinite dimensional. This\nis shown in [Hem76] using the fact that the group homology of Zn , Hi (Zn ), is nontrivial for arbitrarily high i. Since M and N are both covered by R3 they are both\nK(\u03c01 (M), 1)'s, and therefore are homotopy equivalent. The main result of [GMT]\nis that if N is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, M is an irreducible manifold, and\nf : M \u2192 N is a homotopy equivalence, then f is homotopic to a homeomorphism.\nSince we are in the situation of the hypothesis, M is homeomorphic to a hyperbolic\nmanifold when finitely covered by a hyperbolic manifold.\nThe virtual Haken conjecture asserts that if M is a closed irreducible threemanifold with infinite fundamental group, then M is finitely covered by a Haken\nmanifold. This implies that M is either Seifert fibered or admits a hyperbolic structure. Much work has been done on this conjecture. In particular, Dunfield and\nThurston [DT] have shown that the 10,986 closed hyperbolic manifolds in the snappea census [Wee] are virtually Haken. Cooper and Long proved that most Dehn\nfillings of a non-fibered atorodial three-manifold with torus boundary are virtually\nHaken in their paper, [CL99]. Most recently, Masters, Menasco and Zhang [MMZ]\nshowed that infinitely many fillings of certain twist knots are virtually Haken.\nIn chapter 3, we show that infinitely many fillings of a large class of two-bridge\nknots are virtually Haken. The two-fold branched cover of the three-sphere, branched\nover a rational knot kp/q , is the lens space Lp/q . The preimage of the branching locus\nis an unknot kg\np/q in the lens space. Furthermore, the q-fold cyclic cover of Lp/q is\n\n3\nthe three-sphere and kg\np/q lifts to a link Dp/q in S . The complement S3 \u2212 Dp/q is\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthus the dihedral cover of S 3 \u2212 kp/q . This cover is a great circle link complement.\nWe explain all this in more detail in chapter 3. We also show that when p/q < 1/4,\nthe dihedral cover of the rational knot complement contains a closed incompressible\nsurface S. We show that infinitely many fillings of the rational knot lift to fillings\nof the dihedral cover where the incompressibility of this surface is preserved. Thus,\ninfinitely many fillings of a large class of two-bridge knot complements are explicitly\nshown to be virtually Haken.\nNote that many rational knots knots are fibered, and so do not fall under Cooper\nand Long's hypothesis. Specifically, it follows directly from the work of Gabai, [Gab86]\nthat a two-bridge knot kp/q is fibered if and only if p/q = 1/(a1 + 1/(a2 + 1/(a3 +\n.....an ))) where each ai = \u00b12. Here we are using the fact that a rational knot kp/q\nwith p/q = 1/(a1 + 1/(a2 + 1/(a3 + .....an ))) can be written as the Murasugi sum\nof n bands, where the ith band has ai half-twists, see [Bur85, Chapter 12]. Using\nthis, we can easily obtain infinitely many fibered two-bridge knots that are not torus\nknots and which can be written as kp/q with p/q < 1/4. For example, the knot k5/23\ncan be also be written as the knot k18/23 , using the equivalences of Lens spaces, and\n18/23 = 1/(2 + 1/(\u22122 + 1/(2 + 1/(\u22122 + 1/(\u22122 + 1/2))))).\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n6\n\nChapter 2\n\nClassification\nIn this section, we introduce great circle links and exhibit some of their properties.\nWe characterize the torus decomposition of the complements of great circle links in\nS 3 . In addition, we classify great circle links up to five components.\n\n2.1\n\nStructure of the three-sphere\n\nFor the purposes of understanding the algebra of S 3 , S 3 will be identified with the unit\nquaternions, where the space of quaternions is H = {q = a+bi+cj+dk : a, b, c, d \u2208 R}\nwith i2 = j 2 = k 2 = \u22121, ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, ji = \u2212k, kj = \u2212i, ik = \u2212j, and the\nnorm is given by |q|2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 . Any point p in the unit quaternions\nthat has 0 real part is called a pure unit quaternion and we will call this 2-sphere\nPUQ. Any such p defines two complex structures on the quaternions by left and\nright multiplication. This is most commonly done with the pure unit quaternion i.\nAs such we have a notion of p-complex lines in H= R4 . \u03bbx and x\u03bb will be called the\nleft p-line through x and the right p-line through x respectively, where \u03bb = l + mp\nand l, m \u2208 R, and x is any point in H. When the context is clear we will omit the\nleft or right. The restriction of a left or right p-line to the unit 3-sphere S 3 will be\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n7\n\ncalled a left or right p-fiber respectively. These fibers are all geodesics.\nLemma 2.1 Every geodesic g in S 3 is a left fiber and a right fiber.\ng is the intersection of a 2-plane in R3 with the unit 3-sphere in R4 . Any two points\nx and y on g are linearly independent, so the plane can be defined as {lx + my :\nl, m \u2208 R}. This plane intersects the two-sphere PUQ in at least two points. It\nalso intersects the image of this sphere under left multiplication by y yPUQ, in two\npoints. yPUQ is another two-sphere in S 3 , since y \u2208 S 3 . Therefore lx + my = yq\nfor some q \u2208 PUQ. Furthermore, l2 + m2 = 1, since x, y, q \u2208 S 3 . This implies that\nx and y are in the right q-fiber y\u03bb, where \u03bb = r + sq and r 2 + s2 = 1. Note that\ny = y(1 + 0q) and x = y(\u2212 ml + 1l q), so the right q-fiber through y is the exactly\nthe geodesic of S 3 in the plane defined by x and y. The identical method holds for\nwriting g as a left fiber. \u0003\nConsider the right q-fibers through x and y, x(l + mq) and y(l + mq), where\nl2 + m2 = 1. The distance between two points x and y in S 3 is the change in angle\nalong a geodesic that goes from one to the other. Such a geodesic is a left p-fiber for\nsome p \u2208 H, so (r + sp)x = y. Right multiplication by (l + mq) takes this left p-fiber\nto another p-fiber, preserving the distance between them, since (r + sp)x(l + mq) =\ny(l + mq). Therefore there is a well-defined distance between two right q-fibers, the\nshortest distance between a given point x on one fiber and any point on the other\nfiber. The same argument holds for left fibers.\nLemma 2.2 For every pair of points p,q \u2208 PUQ, there is a geodesic in S 3 that is a\nleft p-fiber and a right q-fiber.\nFirst note that the map \u03c8 : S 3 \u2192 S0(4) by sending x to the transformation\nof S 3 that sends y to xyx\u22121 has image the natural copy of SO(3) \u2282 SO(4) that\nfixes 1. This transformation leaves the 2-sphere of pure unit quaternions invariant,\nsince it is a fixed distance from 1 in R4 . The kernal of \u03c8 is \u00b11, which is finite, so\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n8\n\nthe image is 3-dimensional. Since SO(3) is a connected 3-dimensional group, the\nimage of \u03c8 is all of S0(3). The action of SO(3) is transitive on the 2-sphere PUQ,\nso there is a x \u2208 S 3 such that p = xqx\u22121 . We claim that the left p-fiber and the\nright q-fiber of x are the same. The first is {(l + mp)x|l, m \u2208 R, l2 + m2 = 1}.\n(l + mp)x = lx + mpx = lx + mxq = x(l + mq), which is the right q fiber of x. This\nproves the claim. \u0003\nWe take H as a left C-module. Then H = C2 by \u03c6 : a+bi+cj+dk 7\u2192 (a+bi, c+di).\nStereographically project the unit three-sphere in C2 so that (1, 0) maps to the origin,\nand the circles {(z, 0), |z| = 1} and {(0, w)} map to the z-axis \u222a\u221e and the unit circle\nin the x-y plane, respectively. Then we can see that any two right p-fibers will wrap\naround each other with a left-handed twist and any two left p-fibers will wrap around\neach other with a right-handed twist.\nDefinition 2.3 The quotient of S 3 by identifying left (resp. right) q-fibers is S 2 .\nThe induced fiber bundle structure will be called a right-handed (resp. left-handed)\nq-bundle. In this terminology, the standard Hopf fibration is a right-handed i-bundle.\nNote that the distance between points on the quotient S 2 is the distance between\nq-fibers in S 3 .\nLemma 2.4 The image of a geodesic of S 3 under the projection map associated to\nany right-handed or left-handed bundle is either a circle or a point.\nConsider some geodesic g in S 3 . Then g is a left and a right fiber. Without loss\nof generality, consider a left p-bundle and look at the image of g on the quotient\n2-sphere. Since g is a right q-fiber, g = {y(l + mq)|l, m \u2208 R, l2 + m2 = 1}, for\nsome y \u2208 S 3 . y is in some left p-fiber, fp . The other fibers that g intersects are\nfp (l + mq). (Recall that right multiplication by a unit quaternion takes left p-fibers\nto left p-fibers.) Let h be the geodesic in S 3 that is both a right q-fiber and a left\np-fiber. Then any point in g is a fixed distance \u03b1 from h. The left p-fibers that g\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n9\n\nintersects are also at distance \u03b1 from h. Therefore, in the quotient S 2 , the image of\ng is a fixed distance from the image of h, a point on the sphere. This can only be a\npoint or a circle centered at h. \u0003\nNote that a geodesic passes through each fiber of a generic geodesic fibration twice\nbecause if two geodesics intersect at a point x, then they also intersect at \u2212x.\nDefinition 2.5 We will call a link in S 3 such that each component is a geodesic of\nS 3 a great circle link.\nNote that any link L in S 3 where each component is a round circle and the\ncomponents pairwise link \u00b11 can be realized as a great circle link, by the following\nargument due to Thurston. Consider S 3 as the unit three-sphere in R4 . Then the\ncomponents of the link L are the intersection of planes in R4 with S 3 . Since each pair\nof components links once, the planes will intersect pairwise in a point in the interior\nof B 3 , where \u2202B 3 = S 3 . Now expand the unit S 3 to be a sphere with slightly larger\nradius. The same planes in R4 will intersect this sphere in round circles that do not\nintersect, and pairwise link once. Project these radially onto the unit three-sphere.\nThis will be a new link of round circles that pairwise link once that is isotopic to\nthe original link. These circles are the intersection of planes in R4 that intersect in\nthe interior of the unit B 3 and their intersections are slightly closer to the origin\nthan before. Continue \"out to infinity\" until the planes do intersect exactly in the\norigin and we have isotoped our link to be a great circle link. At no point in this\nprocess (including the limit) do the circles intersect. Radial projection preserves the\nnormalized distance between points. Taking the intersection of a larger sphere with\nthe same set of planes increases the normalized distance between points on different\ncomponents, when these planes intersect in the interior of the unit B 3 .\nWe will consider two great circle links to be equivalent if there is an isotopy\nbetween them through great circle links. It is unknown if every two great circle links\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n10\n\nthat are isotopic are isotopic through great circle links. However, we conjecture that\nthere should be such a pair with a high number of link components. The classification\nthat follows shows that there is no such pair with five or fewer components.\n\n2.2\n\nTorus Decomposition\n\nLemma 2.6 An incompressible torus in a great circle link complement is unknotted.\nWe have a link of n great circles. Pick some component. Then the remaining links\nare contained in an open solid torus, and each travels once around in the longitudinal\ndirection. Thus we may think of the link complement as the mapping torus M\u03c6 of\na homeomorphism \u03c6 : S \u2192 S, where S is a p - punctured sphere and \u03c6 fixes each\npuncture. Suppose there is an incompressible torus T in M. Then T (in fact any\nincompressible surface) can be isotoped so that the only singularities with respect to\nthe fibers are saddle singularities, by [Has86]. Then there is an induced foliation on\nthe surface, the intersection of the fibration of M\u03c6 by p-punctured spheres with the\nsurface. Saddle singularities will induce isolated singularities on the surface foliation\nwith index -1. By the Hopf index theorem, the Euler characteristic of the surface\nis the sum of the indices of the isolated singularities of any codimension 1 foliation.\nTherefore, saddles would imply additional genus, and T must be vertical with respect\nto the fibration. Pick some level, F0 . Then T \u2229 F0 is a union of circles. An outermost\ncircle must glue to an outermost circle under the monodromy \u03c6 since \u03c6 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism. Any outermost circle must map to itself since \u03c6\ntakes each puncture to itself. Therefore, if there is one torus component, there will\nbe one circle at each level. At each level this circle bounds a disk on both sides, and\nthe torus bounds a disk \u00d7S 1 on both sides, and so is unknotted. \u0003\nWe call a collection of non-boundary parallel incompressible tori minimal if each\ncomponent of the complement of the collection is either hyperbolic or the union of\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n11\n\nfibers of the same Hopf fibration, and no subset of the collection would satisfy this\ncondition. By lemma 2.6, these tori can be taken to be unknotted. Given a component\nof the complement of a minimal collection of tori, we can obtain a geodesic link in\nS 3 by adding a link component for each torus in the boundary. We may assume that\nthis new component is a great circle, since there were great circles on both sides of\nthe torus before cutting.\nConversely, suppose that we have two geodesic links, L1 and L2 with m and n\ncomponents. We can obtain a link with m + n \u2212 2 components in the following way.\nPick a link component c1 of L1 and a component c2 of L2 . Geodesic links in S 3 can be\nregarded as the intersection of a plane in R4 with S 3 = {(w, x, y, z)|w 2 +x2 +y 2 +z 2 =\n1}. Without loss of generality, c1 can be identified with the plane (0, 0, y, z). We can\nassume that there is a torus neighborhood w 2 + x2 \u2264 \u03b4 around c1 that does not\nintersect any of the other components of L1 . We move the other components by\nletting the planes associated with them flow under vector fields normal to the torus\nw 2 + x2 = \u03b4.\nWe claim that the circles associated with these planes will not intersect under this\nflow. We will indicate a plane in R4 by a basis, {(w1 , x1 , y1, z1 ), (w2, x2 , y2 , z2 )}. Two\nplanes P and P \u2032 intersect in a 1-dimensional or greater vector space exactly when\nthen their unit circles will intersect in a point or coincide. At time t , let plane P\nand P \u2032 be moved to the planes represented by {(tw1 , tx1 , y1 , z1 ), (tw2 , tx2 , y2 , z2 )} and\n{(tw1\u2032 , tx\u20321 , y1\u2032 , z1\u2032 ), (tw2\u2032 , tx\u20322 , y2\u2032 , z2\u2032 )}. This will not change the number of solutions to\nthe homogeneous system:\n\uf8ee\n\nw1 w2 w1\u2032 w2\u2032\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef x1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef y1\n\uf8f0\nz1\n\nx2\n\nx\u20321\n\ny2\n\ny1\u2032\n\nz2\n\nz1\u2032\n\n\uf8f9\uf8eb\n\na\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8fa\uf8ec b \uf8f7 \uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7 = \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u2032 \uf8fa\uf8ec\nc \uf8f7 \uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\ny2\n\uf8fb\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n0\nd\nz2\u2032\n\nx\u20322\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n12\n\n\u221a\nEventually, the other planes intersect S 3 will satisfy x21 + x22 \u2265 1/ 2. If we do the\nsame thing for L2 , then we can glue the two boundary Clifford tori together to embed\nthe link {L1 \u2212 c1} \u222a {L2 \u2212 c2} in S 3 . We will call such a link the torus sum of L1 and\nL2 along c1 and c2. See figure 2.1. In this picture the bottom link is the torus sum of\na left-handed Hopf link and a right-handed Hopf link along the 3rd component (from\nthe left) of each link. Swing the 3rd component of the right-handed link around to\nget the exact picture.\nFigure 2.1: The torus sum of a left-handed Hopf link (-3) and a right-handed Hopf link (+3).\n\nLemma 2.7 Every geodesic link complement in S 3 can be written as a torus sum of\npieces with hyperbolic or Seifert fibered geometric structures. The link components in\neach Seifert fibered piece are Hopf fibers of the same Hopf fibration, when considered\nas a link in S 3 .\nBy the Neilson-Thurston theory of surface automorphisms, \u03c6 is isotopic to an\nautomorphism that is either reducible, periodic or pseudo-Anosov, by [Thu88, Theorem 4]. A pseudo-Anosov automorphism will yield a hyperbolic mapping torus,\n[Thua, Ota01] and a periodic one will yield a Seifert fibered space. If \u03c6 is reducible,\nthere are simple closed curves invariant under \u03c6 that divide the surface into regions\nwhere \u03c6 acts either as a periodic or pseudo-Anosov map. These will result in incom-\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n13\n\npressible tori described above. This proves the first claim of the lemma, which also\nfollows from the geometrization of Haken manifolds, a proof of which can be found\nin [Smi84].\nConsider some piece that is Seifert fibered. Then the compact submanifold obtained by deleting an open regular neighborhood of each link component is also Seifertfibered. This is a closed solid torus with some open neighborhoods of interior curves\nthat intersect a meridian disk once removed. The resulting local product structure\ncan be extended over the solid tori to give us a Seifert fibering of S 3 . So now we need\nto consider Seifert fiberings of S 3 , with base space B. If B has a cover B\u0303, then any\nbundle structure over B with fiber F will extend to a bundle structure over B\u0303 with\nfiber F . This bundle will be a covering space of the bundle over B. Therefore, since\nS 3 does not have any non-trivial covers, B cannot have any non-trivial covers. The\nbase space B is a two-dimensional orbifold and since it does not have any non-trivial\ncovers it is either S 2 , or a \"bad\" orbifold, S(p) or S(p, q) where p and q are relatively\nprime [CHK00]. If B = S 2 , then the Seifert fiber structure is a Hopf fibration and\nthe link components are all fibers of this Hopf fibration. If B = S(p, q), then the\nregular fibers will link each other with linking number p \u00d7 q and the singular fibers\nwith linking number p or q. Therefore, the only possible link components would be\nthe singular fibers and there are only two, and any two geodesics in S 3 can be realized\nin their isotopy class as fibers of the same Hopf fibration. The situation is the same\nwith S(p) = S(p, 1). Therefore the Seifert fibered pieces all admit Hopf fibrations\nwhere the link components are fibers. The associated links are called Hopf links. \u0003\nFrom the above considerations, a great circle link is either a Hopf link, or a torus\nsum of Hopf links and/or hyperbolic great circle links, or a hyperbolic great circle\nlink.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\n2.3\n\nClassification\n\n14\n\nClassification\n\nNow we will classify great circle links with five or fewer components. We know that\npure positive and negative Hopf links occur, and that torus sums of lower component\nlinks occur. We need to know when these various links are equivalent, and find all\nhyperbolic links. Although we will use the orientation of S 3 , we classify such links\nup to unoriented equivalence, and will change the orientation of a component when\nconvenient.\nFor the great circle links with two or three components, linear algebra is enough\nto classify them. For four and five component links, we will project a link along a\nHopf fibration and use the fact that all the link components project to round circles\non the quotient two-sphere to classify the link.\n2.3.1\n\nLinks with two and three components\n\nLemma 2.8 There is one two-component great circle link and there are two threecomponent great circle links.\nFor two-component links: The two planes in C2 = R4 that define the link are\nlinearly independent. Therefore there is a linear transformation taking the two planes\nto the planes defined by {(1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0)} and {(0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1)}. If this\nlinear transformation is orientation preserving, it is isotopic to the identity through\nlinear transformations. If it is not orientation preserving, we can flip the orientation\nof one of the components (by reordering the basis elements) so that it is orientation\npreserving. Topologically, this corresponds to the fact that if we have a link with two\nunknotted components that link \u00b11, we can assume that they link +1 after possibly\nchanging the orientation of one of the components.\nFor three-component links: Move the entire link by an isometry as above so that\ntwo of the links are in standard position. The third component will be associated\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n15\n\nwith some two-plane in R4 linearly independent from the other two. This two-plane\nis the graph of a linear map from R2 7\u2192 R2 . This is either orientation preserving or\norientation reversing, and switching the order of the vectors that define the two-plane\nwill not change this. Topologically, this represents the fact that the 3-component\nHopf link 633 is chiral. Therefore there are two distinct three-component great circle\nlinks, denoted by +3 and \u22123. These are the two three-component links in figure 2.1.\n2.3.2\n\nLinks with four and five components\n\nFor the case of four and five-component links, we will use the fact that the projection\nof a great circle link along a Hopf fibration is a collection of round circles on the\nquotient two-sphere, which follows directly from lemma 2.4. There is a circle's worth\nof points in S 3 that map to a point on the two-sphere, and we will identify this\ncircle with the unit tangent space at the point on the two-sphere. In this way, we\nare identifying the geodesic with its quotient in RP3 . This is well-defined since every\ngeodesic in S 3 is invariant under the antipodal map, and its quotient is a geodesic in\nRP3 , the tangent space of S 2 . In general the image of a component of a great circle\nlink under the projection will be a round circle on S 2 with a vector field on it that is\nat a constant angle from the tangent vector field. We want to isotope through great\ncircle links that do not intersect each other. This exactly corresponds to making sure\nthat no two vectors intersect.\nSometimes we do not need to know the vector field on the circle. The image of\na component of a great circle link on the two-sphere is a circle that divides the twosphere into two components. If there are no other circles of the projection on one side,\nwe can isotope this component to a fiber without it intersecting the other components.\nHowever, if the projections of two components intersect, there are two possibilities,\ndistinguished by the vector fields on the projections. These two possibilities are\npictured in figures 2.2 and 2.3.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n16\n\nFigure 2.2: The two great circles that map onto these circles can be isotoped to \"pull apart\" their\nprojections.\n\nNote that the the first case we can push the two components apart from each other\nwithout their vector fields intersecting. For the second one we can push one inside the\nother without their vector fields intersecting. These two notions are the same on the\ntwo-sphere, but with other components in the projection, this will become important.\nLemma 2.9 There are three four-component great circle links.\nLet L be a great circle link in S 3 with four components. Pick three of the components. There is a linear transformation that takes these to a right-handed (positive)\nHopf link or a left-handed (negative) Hopf link. Transform the link by this linear\ntransformation, and project by the Hopf fibration. These three components of L will\nproject to points on the quotient two-sphere. There is only one component of L left,\nand it projects to a round circle. This circle separates the two-sphere into two disks.\nEither all three points corresponding to the other components are on one side of this\ncircle, or the circle separates these points. See figure 2.4 for the possible projections.\nIn the first case, no other components project onto one of the disks that this circle\nbounds. There is a solid torus in S 3 that projects onto this disk under the Hopf\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n17\n\nFigure 2.3: The two great circles that map onto these circles can be isotoped so that the projection\nof one is inside the projection of the other.\n\nfibration, and we can isotope the component through great circles in this torus so\nthat its projection is a point. The link L is a 4-component positive Hopf link if we\nprojected by a right-handed (positive) Hopf fibration or a 4-component negative Hopf\nlink, if we projected by a negative Hopf fibration.\nIn the second case, concentric circles in a right-handed (left-handed) projection\nare the projections of left-handed (right-handed) Hopf links. This can be seen directly\nby looking at the pre-image of such a configuration in the solid torus above a disk that\ncontains the concentric circles. The vector fields on the circles determine the height\nmod 2\u03c0, which is well-defined in the solid torus because there is a section defined for\nthe bundle everywhere except for a point. So then this link is the torus sum of +3\nand \u22123. The torus is above a circle on the two-sphere that separates the concentric\ncircles from the two points. As the order in which we do the torus sum does not\nmatter, there are three different four-component great circle links.\nLemma 2.10 There are seven five-component great circle links.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n18\n\nFigure 2.4: There are three four-component great circle links.\n\n+4\n\n-3\n\n+3\n\nAgain we will project along a Hopf fibration that contains three of the components.\nNow there are two other components that project to circles on the two-sphere. Assume\nfirst that one of these two components can also be isotoped to be a fiber so that\nthere are four fibers. Then there are three possibilities for the projection of the fifth\ncomponent. It either bounds a disk on one side that contains none of these four\npoints or it separates one of the points from the other three, or it separates the four\npoints into pairs. These scenarios are pictured in figure 2.5. The first corresponds\nto the five-component positive Hopf link, and the second to the torus sum of a fourcomponent positive Hopf link and a three-component negative Hopf link, assuming\nthat the projection is by a positive fibration. This is analogous to the situation for\nfour components. For the third configuration, note that there are two incompressible\ntori, one on the inside of the circle and another just on the outside. If we start with\nthree concentric circles, (\u22123) do torus sum on the component that projects to the\noutermost circle with +3, and also do torus sum on the component that projects to the\ninnermost circle with +3, we will get a link that projects to the third configuration.\nTherefore the third configuration corresponds to this torus sum when we project by\na positive Hopf fibration.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n19\n\nThe same configurations for a projection by a negative (left-handed) Hopf fibration\nwill correspond to analogous links with the signs of each piece in the torus sum\nreversed.\nNow suppose that only 3 of the components project to points. Then there are two\ncomponents that project to circles, and each of these circles separates the collection\nof three points on the two-sphere. See figure 2.6 for the projections in this case. If\nthe two circles are disjoint, they still must bound disks containing points on both\nsides, and the two possibilities (the circles cobound an annulus or do not cobound\nan annulus) are at the top left and bottom right. If the two circles intersect, they\ndivide the sphere into four regions. Then either one, two or three of these regions\ncontain some or all of the three points. If only one region contains points, then there\nare two adjacent regions that do not contain points, and the circles can be pushed\none way or the other (see figures 2.2 and 2.3) to become disjoint and then one will\nbound a disk on one side. If two adjacent regions contain points, there will also be\ntwo empty adjacent regions. The case when two non-adjacent regions contain points\nis the second row of figure 2.6 and the case when three regions contain points is the\nthird row.\nFor the first row, after flipping one of the circles around the back of the two-sphere,\nwe see the link is the torus sum of \u22124 and +3.\nFor the second row, flip the component on the left around the back of the twosphere. Then we can either push this circle inside, as in figure 2.3, or not. If we\ncan then we reduce to the case of the first row. If we cannot, then we expand the\nisolated point to a small circle and flip it around. Then we see that we have three\nconcentric circles (\u22123) where we did torus sum along the components that project to\nthe innermost circle and the second circle with +3.\nFor the third row, we can flip the left circle around, push it into the interior of the\nsecond circle, and flip the second circle around to get +3 where we have performed\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.\n\nClassification\n\n20\n\ntorus sum with \u22123 along two components.

We show\nthat S 3 \u2212 Dp/q is the dihedral cover of the rational knot complement S 3 \u2212 kp/q , and\nthat S 3 \u2212 Dp/q is large when p/q < 1/4. We analyze the Dehn fillings of the manifolds\nS 3 \u2212 Dp/q when p/q \u2264 1/4.\n\n3.1\n\nThe links Dp/q\n\nDefinition 3.1 The link Dp/q in S 3 is the q component great circle link that is the\norbit of the great circle {(x + 0i, y + 0i), x, y \u2208 R, x2 + y 2 = 1} under the action of the\ngroup generated by \u03c6p/q : (z, w) 7\u2192 (e2\u03c0i/q z, e2\u03c0ip/q w). When it is clear from context,\nwe will refer to Dp/q by D and \u03c6p/q as \u03c6.\nFirst note that these sets are the union of great circles, since each component is\nthe result of moving a great circle by an isometry. We also claim that the images are\ndisjoint.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n24\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nIf not, then for some real r, r \u2032 , s, s\u2032, (e\u03b1i r, e\u03b2i s) = (e\u03b1 i r \u2032, e\u03b2 i s\u2032 ), where \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032\nare multiples of\n\n2\u03c0\nq\n\nand \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 are the respective multiples of\n\n2\u03c0p\n.\nq\n\nThis implies in\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nmod (\u03c0).

The rest of each component will be the straight\nline (great circle) containing these points.\nWe will refer to a point on one of the \"core axes\" {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : w = 0} and\n{(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : z = 0} by the angle the associated vector makes with (1, 0) or (0, 1) in\nthe z or w complex plane in C2 .\nConsider the action of \u03c62/5 on the the real great circle, the circle that intersects the\nz-axis at 0 and \u03c0 and the w-axis at 0 and \u03c0. As we progress by \u03c62/5 , the components of\nthe link Dp/q will hit the z-axis in the pairs of points {(0, \u03c0), ( 2\u03c0\n, 7\u03c0\n), ( 4\u03c0\n, 9\u03c0\n), ( 6\u03c0\n, \u03c0 ), ( 8\u03c0\n, 3\u03c0\n)}.\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5 5\n5\n5\nThe components intersect the w-axis in the pairs of points labeled {(0, \u03c0), ( 4\u03c0\n, 9\u03c0\n), ( 8\u03c0\n, 3\u03c0\n),\n5\n5\n5\n5\n, 7\u03c0\n), ( 6\u03c0\n, \u03c0 )}, in this order.

Therefore, as the inter-\n\nthe intersection with the w-axis progresses\n\nNumber the components by the orbit of the real great circle {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 :\n\nz \u2208 R, w \u2208 R} under the action of \u03c6p/q . The components numbered 0, q+1\n, 1, q+1\n+\n2\n2\n1, 2, q+1\n+ 2, .....q \u2212 1 intersect the unit circle in the z -plane in the points labelled\n2\n\n0, \u03c0/q, 2\u03c0/q, 3\u03c0/q....(q\u22121)\u03c0/q and their antipodal points. The links in this order intersect the the unit circle in the w-plane in the points labeled 0, p\u03c0/q, 2p\u03c0/q, 3p\u03c0/q.......(q\u2212\n1)p\u03c0/q, and their antipodal points.\nWe will use this to draw a projection of these links in the plane. Place the unit\ncircle in the w-plane on the x \u2212 y plane and think of the unit circle in the z-plane\nas projecting to the z-axis in R3 . Then we draw the link with q arcs connecting the\npairs of points (0, \u03c0), ( \u03c0p\n, \u03c0p\n+ \u03c0), ( 2\u03c0p\n, 2\u03c0p\n+ \u03c0), ( (q\u22121)\u03c0p\n, (q\u22121)\u03c0p\n+ \u03c0) inside the unit\nq\nq\nq\nq\nq\nq\ncircle crossing consecutively crossing over all the previous arcs, and close them on the\noutside consecutively crossing under, so that they pairwise link once, see figure 3.2.\nThis will be called a standard projection of the link Dp/q .\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\n3.2\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n26\n\nExamples of surfaces in the link complements\n\nWe now order the components as they intersect the w-axis, starting with the point\n(0, e0i ). The nth component will intersect the w-axis at a point that makes an angle\nof n( \u03c0q ) with (0, e0i ). We define a genus 2p \u2212 1 surface Sn,n+2p\u22121 for each set of\nconsecutive 2p components along the w-axis. This surface consists of two 2p-holed\nspheres, with 2p tubes connecting them. We can also think of these surfaces as the\nboundary of a union of \"wedges\" and this will be useful later on.\nDefine a z-disk of radius c to be a disk centered at a point (e2\u03c0i\u03b8 , 0) that consists\nof points (z, w) in S 3 with z-coordinate re2\u03c0i\u03b8 , r \u2208 R and w-coordinate satisfying\n|w| \u2264 c. The boundary of this disk is a curve on the torus {(z, w) : |w| = c} =\n\u221a\n{(z, w) : |z| = 1 \u2212 c2 }. A z-wedge of radius c is the union of z-disks for z in some\ninterval (\u03b1, \u03b2). The center of a z-disk is a point in the z-axis, (e2\u03c0i\u03b8 , 0), and we will\ndenote it by \u03b8 when the context is clear. w-disks and w-wedges are defined similarly.\nRecall that a component of one of the links Dp/q looks like {(ren2\u03c0i/q , sen2\u03c0ip/q )|r, s \u2208\nR, r 2 + s2 = 1}.\nLemma 3.2 z-disk facts:\n1. Two different z-disks (resp. w-disks) of radii c and c\u2032 intersect only when c =\nc\u2032 = 1. Then their intersection is the w-axis (resp. z-axis).\n2. A z-disk of radius c and a w-disk of radius c\u2032 intersect only when c2 + c\u20322 \u2265 1.\nIf c2 + c\u20322 = 1, then they intersect in the point (ce2\u03c0i\u03b2 , c\u2032 e2\u03c0i\u03b3 ).\n3. Every component in a dihedral link is in exactly two z-disks and two w-disks for\nany radii. For the component {(re2\u03c0i/q , se2\u03c0ip/q )|r, s \u2208 R, r 2 + s2 = 1} these are\nthe two z-disks centered at \u00b1e2\u03c0i/q and the two w-disks centered at \u00b1e2\u03c0pi/q .\nWe can now easily describe the surface S0,...2p\u22121. It is the boundary of a handlebody\nwith 2p open solid tori removed where the solid tori correspond to the components\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n27\n\n{0, ...2p \u2212 1}. Recall we are ordering the components as they intersect the w-axis,\nstarting with the real great circle, and continuing counter clockwise. The surface\nS0,...2p\u22121 is the boundary of the union of the w-wedges of radius c and z-wedges of\nradius c\u2032 , where c2 + c\u20322 = 1. The two w-wedges are the union of z-disks along\n], and [\u03c0, (2p\u22121)\u03c0\n+ \u03c0] where points on this axis\nopen intervals containing [0, (2p\u22121)\u03c0\nq\nq\nare labelled by their angles. We expand these intervals slightly so that the w-wedges\ncontain arcs of the first 2p components in their interior. Component 0 intersects the\nw-axis in the points (0, \u00b1e0i ) and component 2p \u22121 intersects the w-axis in the points\n(0, \u00b1e(2p\u22121)\u03c0i/q ). When p/q < 1/2, these intervals will not intersect. It follows from\nlemma 3.7 and the classification of lens spaces that we can always express a dihedral\nlink as Dp/q with p/q \u2264 1/2, so that this surface is always well-defined. By the facts\nabove, these two wedges do not intersect each other or any other component. The two\nw-wedges are balls containing exactly the first 2p \u2212 1 components along the w-axis.\n\nRecall that components that intersect the w-axis in points x and x + p\u03c0\nand their\nq\n\nantipodal points will intersect the z-axis in points y and y +\n\n\u03c0\nq\n\nand their antipodal\n\npoints. The z-wedges will be products of z-disks along intervals containing two consecutive components of the set {0, ....2p \u2212 1}. Every component in {0, ...2p \u2212 1}will\nintersect some such interval, since components n and n + p along the w-axis are next\nto each other along the z-axis. We claim that there will be exactly 2p z-wedges, each\ncontaining arcs of the two components that intersect n and n + p on the w-axis, when\np/q < 1/4. The arcs labelled n and n + p are consecutive on the z-axis, so they\nare in the same z-wedge by construction. These will be the only components in this\nz-wedge. Indeed, the two components immediately above and the two components\nimmediately below n and n + p along the z-axis are labelled n + 2p, n + 3p, n \u2212 p and\nn \u2212 2p and these components are not in the set {0, ...2p \u2212 1} if n and n + p are both\nin this set. Thus there are exactly two components that intersect a given z-wedge\ndefining the interior of S0,...2p\u22121. Note that we have also shown that there are at least\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n28\n\ntwo components intersecting every complementary z-wedge. In Figure 3.3 below, the\ntwo types of wedges will grow until they touch and the boundary of the resulting\ncomplex will be the surface S0,1,2,3 .\n\nFigure 3.3: w-wedges and z-wedges of the surface S0,1,2,3\n\nAlthough we have described the surface in terms of the handlebody in S 3 that it\nbounds, we can also describe it directly. There are 4 w-disks, centered at just before\n0, just after\n\n(2p\u22121)\u03c0\n,\nq\n\njust before \u03c0, and just after \u03c0 + (2p\u22121)\u03c0\n. There are 4p z-disks that\nq\n\noccur in pairs. Each pair surrounds part of two components that intersect the w-axis\nat x and x +\n\n\u03c0p\n.\nq\n\nThese components intersect the z-axis consecutively. (Recall that\n\nas we progress by \u03c0/q on the z-axis, we progress by p\u03c0/q on the w-axis.) The two\ndifferent types of disks meet at the torus {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : |z| = |w|}. The boundaries of\nthe disks are longitudes and meridians of this torus, see figure 3.4. The surface on this\ntorus is a checkerboard pattern connecting the two types of disks. The meridianal\ncurves bound disks of S on the inside and the longitudinal curves bound disks of S\non the other side of the torus. The surface S0,..2p\u22121 will make a checkerboard pattern\non this torus, as in figure 3.5. The shadings mark the different sides of the surface.\nThe vertical arcs bound disks on one side, and the horizontal arcs bound disks on the\nother side.\n\n3.3\n\nIncompressibility of the surfaces\n\nTheorem 3.3 S0...2p\u22121 is incompressible in S 3 \u2212 Dp/q whenever p/q < 1/4.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n29\n\nFigure 3.4: Part of the torus where the two types of disks meet.\n\nFigure 3.5: Another view of the surface S.\n\nWe will consider Mp/q to be a the compact manifold S 3 with a regular neighborhood of each component of Dp/q removed. S0...2p\u22121 is the closed surface of genus 2p\u22121\nas described above.\nFirst cut the manifold Mp/q along S0...2p\u22121 into two pieces, M \u2032 and M \u2032\u2032 . If S0...2p\u22121\nis incompressible in both M \u2032 and M \u2032\u2032 , then S0...2p\u22121 is incompressible in M.\nLet M \u2032 be the side where there are 2p components of the link.\nLemma 3.4 When p/q < 1/4, M \u2032\u2032 is homeomorphic to M \u2032 after trivially filling some\nof the torus boundary components of M \u2032\u2032 .\nM \u2032 and M \u2032\u2032 are both the union of wedges. The w-wedges of M \u2032 are the two\nw-wedges that cover the points {0, \u03c0/q, 2\u03c0/q, ...(2p \u2212 1)/q} their antipodal points.\nThese are the points of intersection of the first 2p components along the w-axis and\nthe w-axis. The two complementary wedges, the w-wedges of M \u2032\u2032 , contain at least\n2p intersection points when p/q < 1/4. Similarly, there are 2p z-wedges of M \u2032 , each\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n30\n\ncontaining two arcs. The 2p complementary z-wedges that make up the z-wedges\nof M \u2032\u2032 contain at least 2 arcs each when p/q < 1/4. In addition, the isometry\n\u03c6p/q : (z, w) 7\u2192 (e\n\n2\u03c0i\nq\n\nz, e\n\n2\u03c0ip\nq\n\nw) takes M \u2032 into M \u2032\u2032 when p/q < 1/4. Note that every\n\nwedge of M \u2032\u2032 contains exactly one wedge of \u03c6(M \u2032 ). Trivially fill in any torus boundary\ncomponents of M \u2032\u2032 that are not torus boundary components of \u03c6(M \u2032 ). Then this\nmanifold is obtained from \u03c6(M \u2032 ) by expanding the wedges of \u03c6(M \u2032 ). Thus M \u2032 is\nhomeomorphic to M \u2032\u2032 with some of the torus boundary components of M \u2032\u2032 trivially\nfilled. \u0003\nSuppose there was a compressing disk for S in M \u2032\u2032 . Since this disk does not\nbound a disk in S = S0,...2p\u22121 and does not intersect any of the additional boundary\ncomponents of M \u2032\u2032 , there is a compressing disk for S in M \u2032 . Therefore, it suffices\nto prove that there are no compressing disks in M \u2032 , the side with fewer components.\nNote that M \u2032 is the handlebody minus 2p open solid tori discussed in section 3.1.\nNow we will cut M \u2032 into two components, corresponding to the two w-wedges.\nEach z-wedge meets a w-wedge in a two-holed disk. The outer boundary component\nof this two-holed disk is a curve on the surface S. For each z-wedge (which can be\nthought of as a tube connecting the w-wedges) cut along one of these two-holed disks.\nAfter doing this to all the z-wedges, we will be left with 2 three-balls, M+\u2032 and M\u2212\u2032 ,\nminus neighborhoods of 2p arcs in each ball. These correspond to the original two\nw-wedges. Each of M+\u2032 and M\u2212\u2032 is decorated with the two-holed disks that we cut\nalong. Call the set of these two-holed disks F . Then M \u2032 = M+\u2032 \u222a M\u2212\u2032 , glued along F .\nSuppose that there is a compressing disk D for S in M \u2032 . We will show:\n1. A compressing disk D can be isotoped off of F , the set of 2-punctured disks that\nwe cut along.\n2. There is no compressing disk in the complement of these 2-punctured disks.\nFirst we prove 1, by showing that the subset of the boundary consisting of these\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n31\n\nFigure 3.6: Part of the surface M \u2032 for S0,1,2,3\n\n2-holed disks is incompressible and boundary incompressible to S.\nLet F be any two-holed disk in F , with one boundary curve meeting S. F is\nincompressible in each piece of M \u2032 cut along F . The fundamental groups of these\npieces are \u22172p Z, the free product of 2p copies of Z. The map on fundamental groups\ninduced by inclusion of F into either of these pieces is the natural map Z \u2217 Z \u2192 Z\nonto two components, which is an injective map. Therefore, F is incompressible in\neach piece of M \u2032 , since F is two-sided, and each of M+\u2032 and M\u2212\u2032 is orientable.\nAlso, F is boundary incompressible to S in M \u2032 . If not, then there is a non-trivial\narc c in F isotopic through one of the pieces of M \u2032 to an arc in S, where the endpoints\nof c are fixed during the isotopy. Note that the only non-trivial arc on F that has\nboundary on S is an arc going in between the two holes of F . If this arc c is isotopic\nto an arc x on S, then c together with an arc s\u2032 on the boundary of F is isotopic\nto s\u2032 \u222a x, a loop on S. This clearly cannot happen. c \u222a s\u2032 links one tube once and\nall other tubes 0 times. No such curve on S does this, since any curve in S is in\nthe complement of the two-holed disks. Thus F is boundary incompressible in both\npieces.\nWe will use the fact that each F \u2208 F is incompressible and boundary incompressible in both parts of M \u2032 to show that any compressing disk for S can be isotoped off\nof F . Consider a compressing disk D for S in M \u2032 . Then the intersection of D and F\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n32\n\nis a collection of circles and arcs in D. Suppose that there is an innermost circle of\nthis intersection in D. Then this circle must bound a disk on some F , or else it would\nbe a compressing circle. Therefore, we can isotop F to rid ourselves of this innermost\ndisk, and continue until there are no circles of intersection. Now consider an outmost\narc on D. This arc is isotopic to an arc on S, namely part of the boundary of D.\nSince F \u2208 F is boundary incompressible, it must be trivial in F , and we can isotop\nD across this disk on F to remove this arc of intersection. Therefore, we can isotop\na compressing disk D to remove any outermost arc of F \u2229 D in D and hence all arcs.\nThus we can isotop D off all of F .\nRecall that each two-holed disk corresponds to a z-wedge that intersects two\ncomponents of the link Dp/q . Two such components will intersect the w-axis in points\nlabeled x and x +\n\np\u03c0\n.\nq\n\nConversely, every two components of the link intersecting the\n\nw-axis in points labelled x and x + p\u03c0\nwill meet two of the two-holed disks, and these\nq\ntwo disks will be called corresponding two-holed disks .\nTo prove 2, suppose there is a compressing disk D for S in M \u2032 in the complement\nof F . We cut along F and consider the piece that contains the disk. The boundary\ncurve \u2202D separates the collection of 2 punctured disks in this piece of M \u2032 . If all the\ntwo-holed disks are on one side, the curve is trivial. If only one of the two-holed\ndisks is on one side, then the disk D separates corresponding two-holed disks, and\nintersects the associated components of the link Dp/q . Therefore the curve \u2202D must\nseparate some corresponding pair of two-holed disks from some other corresponding\npair of two-holed disks. These pairs intersect the w-axis in points labelled x and\nx + p\u03c0\nand y and y + p\u03c0\n, where 0 \u2264 x < y < x + p\u03c0\n< y + p\u03c0\n\u2264 (2p \u2212 1) \u03c0q . This is the\nq\nq\nq\nq\n\nonly possibility for the order since the wedge only covers the interval [0, (2p \u2212 1) p\u03c0\n].\nq\nIgnoring the other components, the two pairs in the w-wedge are positioned like those\nin 3.6, with x as the component closest to us, and y +\n\np\u03c0\nq\n\nas the component in the\n\nback. Then if there is a disk that separates the two pairs, we can double it along the\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n33\n\nboundary curve to get a sphere. This implies that there is a way to glue up the two\ncorresponding pairs of two-holed disks so that the links are separated. This is false,\nfor once we glue one pair of corresponding disks, we will have a solid torus with two\nlink components and two arcs in it. One of the remaining arcs is between the link\ncomponents that are created, and cannot be isotoped relative to the boundary out of\nthe solid torus. \u0003\n\n3.4\n\nDihedral covers of rational knots\n\nIn this section, we will show that the link complements S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ) are the dihedral\ncovers of the knot complements, S 3 \u2212 N(kp/q ).\nNote that the homotopy classes of arcs on a four-punctured sphere are indexed\nby their slopes. Minimize the geometric intersection of an arc with the curves m\nand l below, where m is the vertical slope, to put the curve in standard form. We\nsay an oriented arc has slope p/q where p is the oriented intersection with l and q\nis the oriented intersection with m for some orientation of l and m. Without loss of\ngenerality, we can orient m and l so that a curve that twists in a right-hand fashion\nhas positive slope. This is similar to the case for curves on the boundary of a solid\ntorus T in S 3 . Let \u03b1 be a curve that bounds a disk in T and \u03b2 a curve that bounds\na minimal genus surface in S 3 \u2212 T with boundary on \u2202T . Given some curve c on\n\u2202T , the slope of c is p/q, where p is the oriented intersection with \u03b2 and q is the\noriented intersection with \u03b1. We can orient \u03b1 and \u03b2 so that a curve of positive slope\ntwists in a right-handed fashion. Again, if we want to put the curve in standard\nform, we minimize the geometric intersection with \u03b1 and \u03b2. For the complement of\nthe neighborhood of a link in S 3 , we define the curves \u03b1 and \u03b2 on each boundary\ncomponent to be as if there were no other link components.\nDefinition 3.5 Let B, resp. B \u2032 be two balls with two standard interior vertical arcs\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n34\n\nFigure 3.7: The curves m and l on a four-punctured sphere.\n\nmarked. Let hp/q be the homeomorphism of their boundaries that takes a vertical arc\n(slope \u221e) on \u2202B to an arc of slope p/q on \u2202B \u2032 . The rational knot kp/q is the union\nof the marked arcs in S 3 obtained by glueing together B and B \u2032 by hp/q : \u2202B \u2192 \u2202B \u2032 .\n\nFigure 3.8: Ex: the homeomorphism h1/3 takes arc of slope \u221e to an arc of slope 1/3.\n\nFigure 3.9: The knot k1/3 , the trefoil.\n\nLemma 3.6 Every two-bridge knot or link can be written as kp/q for some p/q, (p, q) =\n1.\nWe will show that the two-fold cover of S 2 branched along a two-bridge knot is\nLp/q . In the process, we will perform an isotopy on S 3 that takes a given two-bridge\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n35\n\nknot to rational form. These two facts were first proven by Schubert, [Sch56].\nPut the knot or link in two-bridge form in S 3 . Then the knot meets a 2-sphere S\nin 4 points, a, b, c, d. S divides the 3-sphere into two balls each with two unknotted\narcs of the knot in them. We call these balls B and B \u2032 , glued together by h so that\nh(\u2202B) = \u2202B \u2032 , and h(B) \u222a B \u2032 = S 3 . We may assume that the arcs in B \u2032 (resp. B)\nproject to straight line segments (arcs of slope 1/0) on S ( resp. h\u22121 (S).) Our goal\nis to show that h is isotopic to hp/q , for some p, q, (p, q) = 1. B and B \u2032 are two-fold\n(branched) covered by solid tori G and G\u2032 . We'll identify each of the solid tori with\n{(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : |z| <\n\n\u221a1 }.\n2\n\nThe group of deck transformations is Z2 and generated by\n\n\u03c1 : (z, w) \u2192 (z\u0304, w\u0304). Note this fixes the great circle {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : z \u2208 R, w \u2208 R} and\nthis intersects the solid torus in the two arcs A1 = {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : z \u2208 R, w \u2208 R, |z| <\n1\n,w\n2\n\n> 0} and A2 = {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 : z \u2208 R, w \u2208 R, |z| < 12 , w < 0}. The quotient of\n\nthis solid torus by \u03c1 will be a ball with two standard arcs coming from A1 and A2 .\nLet h\u0303 : \u2202G \u2192 \u2202G\u2032 be the lift of h that commutes with \u03c1, \u03c1h\u0303 = h\u03c1.\n\nFigure 3.10: The map h\u0303 commutes with the action of \u03c1\n\nh\u0303 has the property that a meridianal curve on \u2202G wraps p times around the zdirection (meridian) and q times around the w-direction (longitude) of \u2202G\u2032 , for some\np, q \u2208 Z, (p, q) = 1. This p/q determines the isotopy class of h\u0303. However, we need this\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n36\n\nisotopy to commute with \u03c1. Let c1 be the meridianal curve {( \u221a12 ei\u03b8 , \u221a12 ), 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0}\nand c2 = {( \u221a12 ei\u03b8 , \u2212 \u221a12 ), 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0}. These will both map down to 1/0 arcs on the\nsphere under the map \u03c1 : (ei\u03b1 , ei\u03b2 ) 7\u2192 (e\u2212i\u03b1 , e\u2212i\u03b2 ). First, minimize the intersection of\nh\u0303(c1 (\u03b8)) with the two meridianal curves c\u20321 and c\u20322 on \u2202G\u2032 . We say that two points\n(x, y) on h\u0303(c1 ) \u2229 c\u20321 cancel if there is a disk bounded by the arc xy on h\u0303(c1 ) and the\narc xy on c\u20321 , with no other points of h\u0303(c1 ) inside the disk. If we have non-minimal\nintersection in h\u0303(c1 )\u2229c\u20321 , then we will have such a disk, and since our map h\u0303 commutes\nwith \u03c1, we have two such disks. We can isotope h\u0303 in the union of these two disks to\nreduce the intersection through an equivariant isotopy. Do the same to reduce the\nintersections h\u0303(c1 ) \u2229 c\u20322 , and h\u0303(c2 ) \u2229 c\u2032i , i = 1, 2.\nThe longitudinal curves d\u2032i = {(\u00b1 \u221a12 , \u221a12 ei\u03b8 )} on \u2202G\u2032 are also invariant under \u03c1.\nWe can similarly reduce the intersection of h\u0303(c1 ), and then h\u0303(c2 ) with the di, through\nisotopies of h that commute with \u03c1. Note that the c\u2032i and d\u2032i divide \u2202G\u2032 into 4\nquarters, paired by \u03c1. We next completely straighten the image of the c1 under h\u0303 to\n{(e\n\n\u03b8pi\nq\n\n, ei\u03b8 ), \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0q)} and c2 under h\u0303 to {(e\n\n\u03b8pi\nq\n\n, ei(\u03b8+\u03c0) ), \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0q)}, where 2p is\n\nthe minimal number of oriented intersections of h\u0303(c1 ) with d\u20321 , and 2q is the minimal\nnumber of oriented intersections of h\u0303(c1 ) with c\u20321 . p is how many times the curve\nwraps around in the z-direction, and q is how many times the curve wraps around in\nthe w-direction. We can make this isotopy that straightens the curve equivariant by\ncopying the isotopy on one side of the c\u2032i to the other. Now note that the complement\nof the two (p, q) curves in \u2202G\u2032 is two regions that map to each other under \u03c1. Also\nthe pre-images of these two regions, the complement of the ci in \u2202G, map to each\nother under \u03c1. Therefore, we can straighten the rest of the map equivariantly by\nstraightening it on one component of \u2202G \u2212 (\u222aci ) and extending the isotopy by \u03c1.\nThus, the two-fold cover of S 3 branched along a two-bridge knot or link is a lens\nspace, Lp/q . We will call such a two bridge knot kp/q , since the projection of a standard\narc in one ball maps to a curve of slope p/q. The knot complement, S 3 \u2212 kp/q , is\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n37\n\ng\ncovered by Lp/q \u2212 kg\np/q , where kp/q is the branching locus. \u0003\nLemma 3.7 Assume that q is odd. Lp/q \u2212 kg\np/q is q-fold covered by the great circle\n\nlink complement S 3 \u2212 Dp/q .\n\nRecall that the link Dp/q is the orbit of the great circle {(z, w) \u2208 S 3 , z \u2208 R, w \u2208 R}\nunder the action of Zq generated by \u03c6p/q : (z, w) 7\u2192 (e\n\n2\u03c0i\nq\n\nz, e\n\n2\u03c0ip\nq\n\nw). S 3 \u2212 Dp/q modulo\n\nthe action of \u03c6p/q is the Lens space Lp/q minus a knot. We claim that this knot is\ni\u03b1 i\u03b2\nkg\np/q . A fundamental domain for this action is F = (e , e ), 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 <\n\n2\u03c0\n.\nq\n\nThe\n\nannulus |z| = |w| in F divides F into a z-wedge and a w-wedge, each of which glue\nup to a solid torus under the action of \u03c6p/q . Each of these solid tori has two arcs\nremoved, that are opposite from each other and contained in meridianal disks that\ncome from z-disks and w-disks in the wedges. q vertical arcs on the boundary of the\nz-wedge will glue together to form one p/q curve on the boundary of the resulting\nsolid torus that connects the arcs on this side. A meridianal curve on the boundary\nof the w-wedge will glue to this p/q curve. \u0003\n\nFigure 3.11: This z-wedge will glue up to a solid torus with two arcs removed under \u03c61/3 . The blue\ncurve will glue up to a (1,3) curve.\n\nLemma 3.8 Two two-bridge knots kp/q and kp\u2032 /q\u2032 are equivalent iff q = q \u2032 and p\u00b11 =\n\u00b1p\u2032 ( mod q).\nWe consider two knots in S 3 to be equivalent if there is a homeomorphism of\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n38\n\nS 3 that takes one knot to the other. Recall that the two-fold branched cover of S 3\nbranched along the knot kp/q is the lens space Lp/q . The conditions in the lemma\nare exactly the conditions for the Lens spaces Lp/q and Lp\u2032 /q\u2032 to be homeomorphic\n[Bro60]. If there is an isotopy of S 3 sending kp/q to kp\u2032 /q\u2032 , then the associated lens\nspaces are homeomorphic and q = q \u2032 and p\u00b11 = p\u2032 (modq). On the other hand suppose\nJ : Lp/q \u2192 Lp\u2032 /q\u2032 is a homeomorphism. We will consider the lens space Lp/q to be the\nunion of two solid tori glued together by \u03c6p/q so that a meridian of one boundary torus\nglues to a p/q curve on the other boundary torus. Then J commutes with the action\nof \u03c1, since \u03c1 is in the center of Map(T 2 ). Therefore J induces a homeomorphism\nJ \u2032 : Lp/q /\u03c1 \u2192 Lp\u2032 /q\u2032 /\u03c1. This is a homeomorphism of S 3 that takes one branching\nlocus (the knot kp/q ) to the other branching locus (the knot kp\u2032 /q\u2032 ). By definition, the\ntwo knots are equivalent. \u0003\n\n3.5\n\nVirtually Haken Dehn fillings\n\nNext we discuss Dehn fillings of rational knot complements S 3 \u2212 N(kp/q ). We are\ninterested in which of these fillings lift to fillings of the dihedral link complement. Let\nMp/q = S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ), where N(Dp/q ) denotes a regular neighborhood of the link.\nWe define the longitude of a component of Mp/q to be a curve that bounds a disk in\nS 3 minus that component. Note that \u03c6p/q takes a longitude of one component to a\nlongitude of another. A longitude of S 3 \u2212 N(kp/q ) is a curve on the boundary torus\nthat lifts to a longitude of Lp/q \u2212 N(kg\np/q ) which is a curve on the boundary torus that\n\nbounds a disk in Lp/q which in turn lifts to the union of longitudes of S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ).\nA meridian curve on the boundary of any of these manifolds is a curve that bounds a\ndisk in the appropriate component of the complement. A curve that wraps m times\n\naround the meridian of Mp/q will lift to a curve that wraps 1/2m times around the\nmeridian of Lp/q \u2212 N(kg\np/q ) and this will lift to a curve that wraps 1/2m times around\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n39\n\neach meridian curve of S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ). Therefore, in order to lift a Dehn filling of the\nknot complement to a Dehn filling of the dihedral cover, m must be even (where m\nis the number of intersections of the filling curve with a longitude). Specifically, a\nfilling of the rational knot complement along a curve of slope 2m/l lifts to a filling of\nthe dihedral cover along a multiple slope {m/l, m/l, ...m/l}.\nWe have shown that when a two bridge knot (or its mirror image) can be written\nas kp/q where p/q \u2264 1/4, there is a closed incompressible surface S in Mp/q , the\ndihedral cover of S 3 \u2212 N(kp/q ). We wish to determine when this surface remains\nincompressible under Dehn fillings. Since Mp/q has q boundary components, a filling\nof Mp/q is denoted by a multiple slope \u03b3 = {\u03b31 , \u03b32 , ...\u03b3q }, where \u03b3i is a slope on the\nith torus boundary component Ti . For each slope \u03b3i = m/l, we glue a solid torus F\nto Ti so that a curve that bounds a disk on \u2202F is glued to a curve of slope m/l. We\nuse the convention that a filling corresponding to a curve of slope 1/0 is called trivial.\nIf r and s are slopes on a torus boundary component, \u2206(r, s) denotes the minimum\ngeometric intersection number between two curves with slopes r and s. Let \u03b3 be a\nmultiple slope and \u03b2 = {\u03b21 , ...\u03b2n } a finite collection of imbedded non-trivial curves\non \u2202Mp/q . Let\n\n\u2206(\u03b3, \u03b2) = mini,j {\u2206(\u03b3i , \u03b2j ), \u03b2j \u2282 Ti }.\nWe can think of this as the distance between a complete filling and a partial\nfilling in the case when there is at most one curve of \u03b2 on each boundary component.\nNote that the collection \u03b2 could contain curves on any subset of the torus boundary\ncomponents.\nA slope on a boundary torus T in a manifold M that contains an incompressible\nsurface S is said to be coannular to S if there is an annulus A in M with one boundary component a non-trivial curve on S and one boundary component on T . The\nfollowing theorem of Wu in [Wu] gives us sufficient conditions for an essential (\u03c01 -\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n40\n\ninjective) surface in a manifold with multiple torus boundary components to remain\nincompressible after Dehn filling.\nTheorem 3.9 (Theorem 5.3 of [Wu]) Let X be a set of tori on the boundary of\na compact, orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold W . Let F be a compact essential surface\nin W with \u2202F \u2282 \u2202W \u2212 X, and let \u03b2 be the set of coannular slopes to F on X. Then\nthere is an integer K and a finite set of slopes \u039b on X, such that F is \u03c01 -injective in\nW (\u03b3) for all multiple slopes \u03b3 on X such that \u2206(\u03b3, \u03b2) \u2265 K and \u03b3i \u2208\n/ \u039b.\nIn light of this theorem, we have immediately:\nTheorem 3.10 Infinitely many fillings of the rational knot complement S 3 \u2212 N(kp/q )\nare virtually Haken when p/q \u2264 1/4.\nThe fact that infinitely many fillings are covered by manifolds that contain closed\nincompressible surfaces follows from Theorem 3.3 and the fact that the dihedral cover\nof a rational knot complement is Mp/q = S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ) (Lemma 3.7). Recall that any\nfilling of a rational knot complement along a curve of slope 2m/l lifts to a filling of\nthe dihedral cover along the multiple slope m/l = {m/l, m/l, ...m/l}. Then whenever\n\u2206(m/q, \u03b2) \u2265 K and m/l \u2208\n/ \u039b where \u03b2 and \u039b are as above, then S0,...2p\u22121 remains\nincompressible in Mp/q (m/l). According to [HT85], the only fillings of rational knots\nthat do not produce irreducible manifolds are \u00b12q filling on kp/q with p \u2261 \u00b11(mod\nq) and 0 filling on kp/q with p \u2261 0(mod q). A cover of an irreducible manifold is also\nirreducible. The main result of [HT85] shows that all but finitely many Dehn fillings\nof any rational knots are non- Haken. Therefore, inifinitely many fillings of a rational\nknot complement kp/q are non-Haken, and also covered by irreducible manifolds that\ncontain a closed incompressible surface, when p/q < 1/4. By definition, these fillings\nare virtually Haken. \u0003\nWe can make this more explicit by giving the set \u03b2 and the number K.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n41\n\nLemma 3.11 Let Mp/q = S 3 \u2212 N(Dp/q ) with p/q < 1/4 and S = S0,...2p\u22121. There are\nexactly four slopes on \u2202(Mp/q ) coannular to S, each of which has slope \u00b11.\nOrder the boundary components as they occur along the w-axis as before. Then\ncomponents 0 through 2p\u22121 are all on the same side of S in M. Note that component\n0 is the same as component 2q. Components 0, 2p \u2212 1, 2p and 2q \u2212 1 all are next\nto w-disks along the w-axis. See the figure 3.5 for how the surface S0,...,2p\u22121 and\nthe link components intersect the w-axis. We claim that the boundary components\ncorresponding to the link components 0, 2p \u2212 1, 2p and 2q \u2212 1 are all coannular to S\nand that the coannular slope is \u00b11 in all these cases.\nConsider the components 0 and 2p. All of the other components in their z-wedges\nintersect the z-axis above them, where we say (e\u03b11 , 0) is above (e\u03b12 , 0) if \u03b11 > \u03b12\nand the distance |\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 | is minimized among representatives of the angles. We can\nsee this from the standard projection construction. See figure 3.2 . On the inside\nof the projection of the w-axis, components x + p, x + 2p, x + 3p, etc., cross over\ncomponents x and on the outside they cross under component x. Therefore we can\npush components 0 and 2p to the surface, by pushing them to the w-disks and zdisks simultaneously, without moving the other components. The resulting annuli\nwill each have a boundary component on a torus that goes once around the longitude\nand twists once in a left-handed fashion.\nSimilarly, components 2p \u2212 1 and 2q \u2212 1 are coannular to S. All of the other\ncomponents in their z-wedges are below them, since these components occur at the end\nof the w-wedge, after ordering the components counterclockwise. They are isotopic\nto S such that the resulting annuli will have boundary components on \u2202Mp/q that\ntwist once in a right-handed fashion.\nWe claim that these are all of the coannular slopes. Since we are ultimately\ninterested in the incompressibility of the surface S we need only consider annuli in\na component of Mp/q \u2212 S. Suppose that one of the other boundary components c is\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n42\n\nFigure 3.12: How the link components intersect the w-axis\n\n2p\n2p \u2212 1\n2q \u2212 1\n0\n\n0\n\n2q \u2212 1\n2p \u2212 1\n\n2p\n\ncoannular to S in M \u2032 or M \u2032\u2032 . Call the annulus A. First we reduce the intersection\nof A and the collection P of incompressible, boundary incompressible n- holed disks\nthat cut M \u2032 or M \u2032\u2032 into two balls with neighborhoods of arcs removed. Trivial circles\nof A \u2229 P on A can be removed, starting with an innermost such circle, since P is\nincompressible. If there is a non-trivial circle of A \u2229 P on P , then this circle is\nalso non-trivial in A, since P is incompressible. This implies this circle is boundary\nparallel on A, so we can isotop A relative to the boundary to remove this circle of\nintersection. Now consider arcs of A \u222a P . Call the 2 components of P that touches\nc Pc . Then any arcs of A \u2229 P are either connecting c and S on Pc or trivial on A.\nSince P is boundary incompressible, we can isotope A to remove these trivial arcs.\nThen a component of the intersection of A with Mp/q \u2212 P is a disk D. D gives us an\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.\n\nSome Large Great Circle Links\n\n43\n\nisotopy of c \u2229 (Mp/q \u2212 P ) into S that does not move any other boundary components\nin Mp/q \u2212 P .\nNow if c is not next to one of the w-disks along the w-axis, i.e., component 0,\n2p \u2212 1, 2p or 2q \u2212 1, then there exists a component x such that the components\n{x, c, x + p, c + p} occur in that order (or {c \u2212 p, x \u2212 p, c, x}) along the w-axis, and\nthese components are all in the same w-wedge. Then we see that we are in the\nsituation of figure 3.6, where c is the 2nd or 3rd component from the front. Thus\nthere can be no isotopy that moves c into S fixing the other arcs.\n\u0003\nSince our surface is embedded, we can apply a theorem of Gordon and Luecke\nin [CGLS87]. This says in part that if we have a closed incompressible surface in a\nmanifold with a torus boundary component with slope r coannular to the surface,\nthen Dehn filling along a slope s with \u2206(r, s) > 1 leaves the surface incompressible.\nTherefore, we can analyze a Dehn filling along a multiple slope as follows. First fill\nin along the torus boundary components that do not have coannular slopes. By Wu's\ntheorem above, if we have avoided the finitely many slopes in \u039b, our surface is still\nincompressible. Then we fill along the remaining torus boundary components which\nwill still admit coannular slopes. By the theorem 2.4.3 in [CGLS87], the surface\nremains incompressible if we fill only along slopes that are at a distance greater than\n1 from the coannular slopes. Therefore, we may take K to be 1.\n\n\fBibliography\n[Bro60]\n\nE. J. Brody. The topological classification of lens spaces. Ann. of Math.,\n71:163\u2013184, 1960.\n\n[Bur85]\n\nGerhard Burde. Knots.
