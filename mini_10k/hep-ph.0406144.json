Both features arise\nfrom new particles at the weak scale. Once R-parity is imposed, the existence of dark matter and the unification of gauge couplings can be viewed as\npredictions of the theory.\nRecently, Arkani-Hamed and Dimopoulos argued that in light of the cosmological constant problem, issues of naturalness should be treated delicately. The end result of this argument was a finely-tuned minimal supersymmetric standard model where the higgsinos and gauginos are kept light\nby chiral symmetries, while all scalars are ultra-heavy[4]. While this model\nsolves many of the problems associated with the MSSM, from the low-energy\nperspective the lightness of the standard model-like Higgs is accomplished via\na fine-tuning. This scenario was recently christened \"split supersymmetry\"\nby Giudice and Romanino.\nSince this model is unconcerned with softening the divergence in the Higgs\nboson mass, it seems at first unclear what masses to expect for the new\nfermions. Luckily, a hint is given by the existence of dark matter. A stable,\nweakly coupled particle gives a cosmologically interesting abundance only if\nits mass is at the weak scale[5]. After the gauginos have been placed at the\nweak scale to give the dark matter, gauge coupling unification becomes as a\nsuccessful \"prediction\" of the theory. In split supersymmetry, dark matter\nprovides the sole link between the masses of the new particles and the weak\nscale. Thus, understanding the dark matter has strong implications for both\nfuture collider searches and for direct dark matter detection experiments. We\nfind that there is a large region of parameter space accessible to both future\ndirect detection experiments and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\n2\n\nRelic Abundance\n\nAt first, it might seem possible to compute the dark matter relic density in\nsplit supersymmetry by taking a MSSM relic abundance calculation[6], and\nsimply eliminating all diagrams containing the (now decoupled) scalars. However, the situation is more subtle: there are several differences between the\n1\n\n\flow-energy physics of split supersymmetry and the MSSM with the scalars\neliminated. These should be accounted for in an accurate relic abundance\ncalculation.\nPerhaps the most salient differences between the MSSM and split supersymmetry are in the properties of the lightest Higgs boson. In the MSSM, the\nquartic coupling of the Higgs boson is related to the standard model gauge\ncouplings: \u03bb = (g 2 +g \u20322)/8, leading to the tree level relation m2h = MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2.\nIn split supersymmetry, this relation exists only above the masses of the\nscalars, mS . Below this scale, the quartic coupling flows away from its supersymmetric value. The result is that the Higgs boson may be as heavy as 170\nGeV for large values of mS [4, 7]. Because of the large mass, the width of\nthe Higgs will be substantially different. At 130 GeV, a standard model-like\nHiggs has a width of a few MeV; at 170 GeV, the width approaches 1 GeV.\nEven for mh > 130 GeV, the Higgs boson decays dominantly to W W \u2217 , a\nsituation not normally found in the MSSM. For our relic density and direct\ndetection calculations, we utilize a modified version of DarkSUSY[9]. DarkSUSY only incorporates two-body final states; it was necessary to change the\npackage to take into account the process \u03c70 \u03c70 \u2192 h \u2192 W W \u2217.\nAnother difference between split supersymmetry and the MSSM is in the\ncouplings between the gauginos, higgsinos, and the Higgs boson:\nL \u220b B\u0303(\u03ba\u20321 h\u2020 H\u03031 + \u03ba\u20322 hH\u03032 ) + W\u0303 a (\u03ba1 h\u2020 \u03c4 a H\u03031 + \u03ba2 H\u03032 \u03c4 a h).\n\n(1)\n\nIn the MSSM, these couplings are related by supersymmetry to the gauge\ncouplings:\nr\nr\n3\n3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03ba1 =\ng1 sin \u03b2\n\u03ba2 =\ng1 cos \u03b2\n10\n10\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03ba1 = 2g2 sin \u03b2\n\u03ba2 = 2g2 cos \u03b2.\nIn split supersymmetry, this relation only exists above the scale mS . Below\nmS , these couplings must be run down to their low energy values, accomplished here by using the one-loop renormalization group equations of [7, 8]\nThe couplings of Eqn. (2) also feed into the off-diagonal entries of the\nchargino and neutralino mass matrices. They become:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03ba\u20321 v\n\u03ba\u2032 v\n\u221a\nM1\n0\n\u2212 \u221a22\n2\n\uf8ec\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03ba\u221a1 v \uf8f7\n\u03ba\u221a2 v\n\u2212\nM2\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\nM2 v\u03ba21\n8\n8 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nM\u03c70 = \uf8ec \u03ba\u20322 v \u03ba2 v\n,\n(2)\n,\nM\u03c7\u00b1 =\nv\u03ba2\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n0\n\u2212\u03bc \uf8f7\n2\n\uf8ed \u2212\u221a\n\uf8f8\n2\n\u03ba\u20321 v\n\u221a\n2\n\n8\n\u03ba\u221a1 v\n\u2212 8\n\n\u2212\u03bc\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\fwith v = 246 GeV. Taking these modifications into account, it is possible to\ncalculate the relic abundance of the Dark Matter.\n\n2.1\n\nBino Dark Matter\n\nThe most interesting region for both colliders and direct detection involves\na B\u0303-like LSP (Lightest Supersymmetric Particle), where M1 < M2 , \u03bc. Assuming universal boundary conditions for M1 and M2 at the high scale, we\nexpect this condition to hold due to the renormalization group evolution.\nIn the MSSM, there are many ways in which the B\u0303's may annihilate in\nthe early universe. For example, there exist regions in the MSSM parameter\nspace where the B\u0303 can co-annihilate with a tau slepton or top squark. In split\nsupersymmetry, however, the scalars are quite heavy and are absent at the\ntime of freeze-out due to the Boltzmann suppression. Similarly, no \"funnel\"\nregion exists where the LSP annihilates through the pseudo-scalar Higgs\nboson. Also, there is no t-channel exchange of sleptons. In fact, in a theory\nwhere all scalars are decoupled, a pure bino is completely non-interacting.\nTherefore, in split supersymmetry, the only relevant interactions of a B\u0303-like\nLSP occur through the mixing of the B\u0303 with the H\u0303 and the W\u0303 .\nFig. 1 shows the points with the correct relic abundance in the \u03bc-M1\nplane. We have used the post-WMAP 2\u03c3 allowed region for the Dark Matter,\n0.094 < \u03a9DM h2 < 0.129 [10]. We plot points satisfying the relic density\nconstraint, starting with a base case of tan \u03b2 = 1 (at the high scale), mS =\n1013 GeV, and imposing the phenomenological relation r \u2261 M2 /M1 = 2 (at\nlow energies).1 To get a feeling of how the allowed region depends on these\nparameters, we show the allowed region when the scale of supersymmetry\nbreaking is changed to mS = 106 GeV, when tan \u03b2 is changed to 40 and\nwhen r = 4. In the MSSM, tan \u03b2=1 is not allowed due to the LEP limit\non the Higgs boson mass, here there is no such difficulty. For much lower\nvalues, a Landau pole for the top Yukawa coupling would be encountered not\nfar above the scale mS .\nThere are several distinct regions visible in the plot. First, consider the\ndiagonal stripe cutting across the parameter space. This is a region of mixed\n1\n\nIt is natural to impose a unified relation on the gaugino masses. Where this condition\nis imposed is model dependent. One possibility is the grand unified scale. Another arises in\nthe case of the Scherk-Schwarz breaking model of [4], where the unified condition is imposed\nat the scale 1/R. Given this model dependence, we choose to impose a phenomenological\nrelation at the low scale.\n\n3\n\n\ftan \u03b2 =1\n\n350\n\ntan \u03b2 =1\ntan \u03b2 =1\n300\n\nm s =10\n\n6\n\nr=2\n\n13\n\nm s =10\nr=2\nm s =1013 r=4\n\ntan \u03b2 =40 m s =10 13 r=2\n\nM1(GeV)\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n\u03bc (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: Points in the \u03bc \u2212 M1 plane that satisfy the relic abundance constraint from WMAP. The region at low M1 extending to large \u03bc is the Higgs\nresonance region; the dark matter can be very nearly bino in this region.\nThe diagonal line represents a mixed bino-higgsino dark matter region. The\nallowed region is shown for vaiour values of tan \u03b2, scalars masses, mS , and\nr \u2261 M2 /M1 . The top quark mass is set to 178 GeV.\n\n4\n\n\fbino-higgsino dark matter. Writing\n\u03c701 = N11 B\u0303 + N12 W\u0303 + N13 H\u0303u + N14 H\u0303d ,\n\n(3)\n\nwe can define the higgsino fraction hf \u2261 |N13 |2 + |N14 |2 . Near the base of\nthis stripe of parameter space, hf \u223c .2. In this region, the relic abundance\nis largely controlled by the process \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W + W \u2212 . This process receives\ncontributions from t-channel exchange of charginos, s-channel exchange of a\nZ boson, and s-channel exchange of the Higgs boson. This region is nearly\na straight line in the \u03bc \u2212 M1 plane because all the above diagrams depend\non hf , which in turn can be written as a function of the slope M1 /\u03bc. The\ntop-quark threshold at M1 \u223c 175 GeV is visible. Note, for r = 4 the stripe\nis shifted somewhat, the larger M2 affects the chargino masses, and thus the\nannihilation rate. This stripe of parameter space provides a region where\nthe both the LSP and charginos can be visible at the LHC. This stripe\ndoes connect continuously with an experimentally difficult region of purely\nhiggsino dark matter at high mass, which we will discuss momentarily. The\nregion above and to the left of this stripe the LSP does not provide all of the\ndark matter; another component would be needed to make up the remainder.\nThe horizontal bands at M1 \u223c 80 GeV represent a region where the LSP\nannihilates resonantly via a Higgs boson in the s-channel. This region has\nspecial importance in split supersymmetry. In the usual MSSM, the Higgs\nboson has a mass less than 130 GeV, and a tiny width, making resonant\nannihilation unlikely. In split supersymmetry, the Higgs boson can be much\nheavier, \u223c 160 GeV, where the width approaches a GeV. If the LSP has mass,\nm\u03c7 \u223c 0.5mh , annihilation through the Higgs pole can be very efficient, and\nthe composition of the dark matter can be very bino-like. In the resonance\nregion, the relevant couplings for annihilation are \u03ba\u20321 , \u03ba\u20322 , which must be run\ndown from their supersymmetric values at mS . Looking at Fig. 1, the exact\nlocation of this region in the M1 \u2212 \u03bc varies. Comparing the region for mS =\n1013 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 1, r = 2 to mS = 1013 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 40, r = 2 and\nmS = 1013 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 1, r = 2 to mS = 106 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 1, r = 2 a\ndependence on both mS and tan \u03b2 is visible. This is because these parameters\naffect the Higgs mass. In this region, the lightness of the LSP should allow\nit to be probed at the LHC.\nThe area near the intersection of the diagonal stripe and the horizontal\nband represents a particularly complicated region where many processes are\nat work contributing to the relic abundance. Here, for our choice of r \u2261\n5\n\n\fM2 /M1 = 2, it is possible to get Dark Matter that has a comparable fraction\nof wino, higgsino and bino. If r is increased, the wino fraction decreases.\nFurthermore, co-annihilations can be in this region.\nFinally, for the mS = 1013 , tan \u03b2 = 40, r = 2 and mS = 1013 , tan \u03b2 =\n40, r = 4 regions, a few points are visible at M1 \u223c 50 GeV. There the\nZ-resonance becomes important. These points are not visible for the lower\nvalues of tan \u03b2 or r because they are excluded by the chargino mass bound.\nThis region should be easily accessible at colliders.\n\n2.2\n\nHiggsino and Wino Dark Matter\n\nIn the case of purely Higgsino dark matter, constraints from LEP force the\nLSP to be heavy enough so that the co-annihilation with charginos to W \u00b1\nbosons are allowed. So, a light Higgsino annihilates away too efficiently to\nmake up the Dark Matter. As the mass of the Higgsino is increased, the W W\nthreshold is reached, and the problem worsens. Nevertheless, by making the\nHiggsino heavier, it is eventually possible to make up the observed dark\nmatter, but this is always for \u03bc > 1 TeV , the exact value is sensitive to\ntan \u03b2. In this case, it would be very challenging to observe the Dark Matter\n(or any signature of supersymmetry) at the LHC.\nA similar situation exists for wino dark matter. It can (co)-annihilate\nvery efficiently to gauge boson(s), and only by making it heavy can the\nright relic abundance be achieved. To achieve the correct relic abundance,\nM2 \u223c 2.4 TeV, making this a difficult scenario for colliders indeed. While\nthis scenario is unlikely to occur in a model with unified boundary conditions,\nr < 1 can occur when the gaugino masses are dominated by the Anomaly\nMediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) contribution [11, 12], a situation\nthat is naturally realized if the hidden sector does not have a singlet. In\nAMSB, the masses of the gauginos are suppressed by a loop factor relative\nto the gravitino mass, m3/2 . Then the dark matter calculation above sets\nm3/2 \u223c 1000 TeV . If the scalar masses are unsuppressed relative to this\nscale, they will heavy enough to satisfy constraints from dimension-5 proton\ndecay, flavor changing neutral currents and electric dipole moments, making\nthis a theoretically attractive, but experimentally difficult implementation of\nsplit supersymmetry2 .\n2\n\nIn Ref. [13], a similar construction was utilized, but it was assumed that the dark\nmatter was generated non-thermally. This allowed the W\u0303 's to be lighter, with possible\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nDirect Detection\n\nIn the MSSM, it is somewhat complicated to discuss the prospects for direct\ndetection. There are several intermediate particles that can contribute to\nthe spin-independent cross-section: the light Higgs boson, the heavy Higgs\nboson, and squarks. The frustrating possibility of a cancellation between\nvarious intermediate states exists; in principle, the cross-section for direct\ndetection can go nearly to zero[14]. In split supersymmetry, there is a single\ndominant diagram for direct detection: the exchange of the Higgs boson,\nutilizing the B\u0303 \u2212 H\u0303 \u2212 h or W\u0303 \u2212 H\u0303 \u2212 h vertices. These couplings provide a\ncoherent contribution to the spin-independent scattering amplitude off nuclei.\nWe display the prospects for direct detection of bino-like Dark Matter in\nsplit supersymmetry in Fig. 2. We show four sets of points corresponding to\nthe models scanned in Fig. 1.\nFirst we discuss some general features. In the bino-like dark matter case,\nthere is always a heavy higgsino component, particularly in the diagonal\nstripe of Fig. 1. There, the B\u0303 \u2212 H\u0303 mixing selects a fixed value for the\n\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7 \u2212 h vertex. The diagonals in Fig. 1 correspond to the flat horizontal\nbands seen in Fig. 2 for each model above roughly m\u03c7 >\n\u223c 80 GeV.\n13\n6\nChanging mS from 10 GeV to 10 GeV causes an increase in the scattering cross section. This may largely be explained by the change in the\nHiggs boson mass, which increases as mS increases:\n\u03c3\u03c7N \u221d\n\n1\n.\nm4h\n\n(4)\n\nFor mS = 106 GeV, the Higgs boson mass is roughly 140 GeV, while for mS =\n1013 GeV, the Higgs boson mass is roughly 160 GeV. For all cases considered\nhere the Higgs boson is heavier than in the MSSM; the result is a suppression\nin the detection rate. Yet the change in the Higgs boson mass does not\nexplain the difference in cross section completely. Even after correcting for\nthis factor, the direct detection rates for mS = 106 GeV and mS = 1013 GeV\nstill can differ by order 10%. This is because the \u03ba\u2032 parameters, important\nfor detection, run differently from the two mS scales.\ninteresting collider phenomenology. However, this approach is at odds with our philosophy\nthat the thermal abundance of the Dark Matter is what puts the fermions at the weak\nscale. Some discussion of the phenomenology of AMSB with unsuppressed scalar masses\nwas also contained in the earlier [12].\n\n7\n\n\f\u221242\n\n10\n\n\u03c3(\u03c7\u2212 nucleon) cm2\n\nCDMS II (Current)\n\u221243\n\n10\n\nCDMS II (Projected)\n\n\u221244\n\n10\n\nGENIUS\n\u221245\n\ntan \u03b2 =1\n\n10\n\ntan \u03b2 =1\ntan \u03b2 =1\n\n6\n\nr=2\n\n13\n\nr=2\nr=4\n\nm s =10\n\nm s =10\nm s =1013\n\ntan \u03b2 =40 m s =10 13 r=2\n\n\u221246\n\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n100\n\n80\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nM\u03c7 (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: The spin-independent LSP-nucleon scattering cross-section for\npoint agreeing with the WMAP relic density constraint. Curves are plotted for various values of mS (the scale of the scalar masses), tan \u03b2 (set at\nmS ), and r \u2261 M2 /M1 . The flat regions for m\u03c7 >\n\u223c 80 GeV correspond to\nmixed bino-higgsino dark matter. The sharp decrease at lower masses is due\nto resonant annihilation through the Higgs boson and Z-boson poles. Also\nshown are the current bound from the results of the Cryogenic Dark Matter\nSearch (CDMS) at Soudan [16], the projected bounds from this experiment\n[17], and projected bounds from a representative next generation dark matter\nexperiment, GENIUS [18]\n.\n\n8\n\n\fIn Fig. 2, it can be seen that the rate for tan \u03b2 =40 is suppressed relative\nto tan \u03b2 = 1 case. In the decoupling limit (cos \u03b1 = sin \u03b2, sin \u03b1 = \u2212 cos \u03b2 ),\nthe amplitude for scattering via the light Higgs boson in the MSSM is given\nby [6]\nAh \u221d (g2 N12 \u2212 gY N11 )(N14 sin \u03b2 \u2212 N13 cos \u03b2).\n(5)\nIn split supersymmetry, the gauge couplings (and \u03b2's) are replaced at low\nenergies by \u03ba parameters. However, since the \u03ba's do not deviate drastically\nfrom the supersymmetric values, traditional MSSM formulas are still useful\nto gain intuition. It is instructive to examine the higgsino like limit, where\n[19]\n1 + sin 2\u03b2 \u00012\n\u03c3\u03c7\u2212nucleon \u221d\n(6)\n\u03bc \u2212 M1\n\nIn this limit, we can see that the cross section can be enhanced by roughly a\nfactor of four relative to the large tan \u03b2 limit at tan \u03b2 \u2248 1. This is in rough\nagreement with Fig. 2; there is some deviation due to the mixed B\u0303 \u2212 H\u0303\nnature of the LSP. We expect tan \u03b2 = 1 to give scattering cross sections near\nmaximal for this model.\nThe precipitous drop in the cross section below 80 GeV is due to the\npresence of the Higgs resonance region. In the Higgs resonance region, the\nLSP can be very pure bino, which leads to a small LSP coupling to the Higgs\nboson. While the s-channel resonance compensates for this in the early\nuniverse, the resonance effect is not available in direct detector experiments.\nA second drop is visible for the lowest mass points on the the tan \u03b2 = 40,\nmS = 1013 GeV, r = 2 and tan \u03b2 = 1, mS = 1013 GeV, r = 4 curves. These\nare points where the Z-pole is important for determining the relic abundance.\nThe glitch in the curves at a LSP mass of m\u03c7 \u223c 175 GeV is physical.\nAs the top threshold opens up, the higgsino fraction, hf , necessary to maintain the measured relic abundance changes. This, in turn, affects the direct\ndetection rate.\nNote that for the case where r = 2, tan \u03b2 = 1, and mS = 1013 GeV, there\nis a region near m\u03c7 \u223c 80 GeV where the cross section increases somewhat.\nThis region is due to the presence of Dark Matter that has a non-negligible\nwino fraction. In this case, the \u03ba couplings, rather than the \u03ba\u2032 couplings can\nenter. Unsurprisingly a similar region is not visible for the r = 4, tan \u03b2 = 1,\nmS = 1013 GeV. In this case, the wino fraction of the LSP is suppressed.\nCross-sections can reach a few \u00d710\u221244 cm2 , a level that will be covered\nsoon by direct search experiments such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search\n9\n\n\f(CDMS) experiment in the Soudan mine (see Fig. 2). A planned upgrade\n(CDMS III) should reach a roughly a factor of three below the CDMS II\nprojection. Future planned experiments, such as GENIUS[18] could reach\nthe 10\u221245 cm2 level. This would allow coverage of much of the horizontal\nregion in Fig. 2. Relocating a CDMS-like experiment to a site with even\nlower neutron background than the Soudan mine could conceivably reach\nthe 10\u221246 cm2 level[20]. In this case, even parts of the resonance regions\nwould be accessible.\nFor the case of very pure higgsino and very pure wino dark matter, the\ndirect detection cross section is strongly suppressed. Since the dominant contribution to the spin-independent cross-section comes from the H\u0303 \u2212 B\u0303 \u2212h and\nH\u0303 \u2212 W\u0303 \u2212h vertices, non-mixed dark matter is difficult for detection. Unfortu\u221250\nnately, scattering cross-sections can be astonishingly low: \u03c3\u03c7N <\ncm2 .\n\u223c 10\nThis study also has interesting implcations for dark matter detection in\nthe traditional MSSM with low energy supersymmetry. Consider the generic\ncase where the dark matter of the MSSM is mixed H\u0303 \u2212 B\u0303, and resonances\nand coannihilations are unimportant for determining the relic abundance.\nBecuase the Higgs boson mass is heavier in split symmetry than in the MSSM,\nin the absence of accidental cancellations between detection diagrams, the\nhorizontal band with mS = 1013 , tan \u03b2 = 40 of Fig. 2 actually represents a\nvery conservative lower bound on the detection cross section for MSSM dark\nmatter. Thus, the cross section 10\u221245 cm2 represents an exciting target for\ndirect detection both for split supersymmetry and the usual MSSM.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have explored dark matter in split supersymmetry. It is exciting that\nthere is a large region of bino-like dark matter where the LSP is light. This\ncould allow for the discovery of charginos and neutralinos at the LHC. There\ndo also exist regions that are troublesome for colliders and direct detection: both pure higgsino and pure wino dark matter would be quite heavy\n(>\n\u223c 1 TeV ), and would have a very small scattering cross-section off nuclei.\nIt would be interesting to explore the indirect detection of the dark matter\nin this model, especially in this troublesome region where direct detection\nbecomes more difficult. In the pure wino case, it might be possible to observe\nthe annihilation of the dark matter to \u03b3\u03b3 at a future experiment such as\nGLAST (Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope) [21].\n10\n\n\fAway from the Higgs resonance, the model can have mixed bino\u2013higgsino\ndark matter which should be detectable at future direct detection experiments. It is especially encouraging that a region exists where the dark\nmatter could be observed at both the LHC and direct detection experiments.\nThis would allow for a conclusive demonstration that the particle seen at\naccelerator is in fact responsible for the Dark Matter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to A.
