2001\n\nInitial-Final State Subspace of the SU(n) Gauge Theory with\nExplicit Gauge Field Mass Term\nZe-sen Yang, Xianhui Li and Xiaolin Chen\nDepartment of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, CHINA\nNovember 1, 2018\n\nAbstract\nAs a part of our study on the SU(n) gauge theory with explicit gauge field mass term this paper\nis devoted to form the Gupta-Bleuler subspace of the initial-final states in the scattering process.\n\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Db, 03.80.+r, 11.20.Dj\n\nWe proved in Ref. [1] that the explicit gauge field term is harmless to the renormalisability of the\nSU(n) gauge theory. Furthermore we developed a method in in Ref. [2] to construct the scattering matrix\nwith the renormalized field functions as basical variables. In this paper we will show how to form the\nGupta-Bleuler subspace of the initial-final states in the scattering process.\nAs was pointed out in section 2, the particles in the initial or final states are described by the following\nLagrangian and Lorentz condition:\n\u0001\n1 [0] [0]\u03bc\u03bd 1 2\nFa\n+ M Aa\u03bc A\u03bca + L\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c9a (x) \u2202 \u03bc \u03c9a (x) ,\nL0 = \u2212 Fa\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n2\n\n\u2202 \u03bc Aa\u03bc = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere Aa\u03bc , \u03c9a , \u03c9 a stand for the renormalized gauge and ghost field functions. M is the renormalized\n[0]\n\nmass parameter of the gauge fields. Fa\u03bc\u03bd is defined by\n[0]\nFa\u03bc\u03bd\n(x) = \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc (x) .\n\n(3)\n\nAccording to the operator description of Ref. [2] we should keep the ghost term in equation (1) and form\nthe initial-final state subspace by following the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method. To this end we first\n1\n\n\fuse the Lorentz and modify (1) into\n\u0001\n1\nLe0 (x) = LGB (x) + M 2 Aa\u03bc (x)A\u03bca (x) + L\u03c8 (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c9 a (x) \u2202 \u03bc \u03c9a (x) ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere LGB (x) is a Gupta\u2013Bleuler Lagrangian\n\u00012\n1 [0] [0]\u03bc\u03bd 1 \u03bc\nFa\n\u2212 \u2202 Aa\u03bc .\nLGB (x) = \u2212 Fa\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n2\nThen we disregard the Lorentz condition and perform a canonical quantization with Le0 (x) and define the\n\ncorresponding Hamiltonian operator H0 and field operators. Moreover we have to choose the so-called\nphysical states and define a physical initial-final state subspace with the help of the Lorentz condition\nand the residual symmetry. We certainly expect the ghost particles to be excluded from appearing in the\ninitial-final states.\nAssume that the operators of \u03c9a (x) are anti-hermitian and therefore the operators of \u03c9 a (x) is hermi(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ntian. Let \u03c9a (x), \u03c9a (x) stand for \u03c9a (x), i\u03c9a (x) and \u03a0a , \u03a0a , \u03a0a\u03bc stand for the canonical momenta\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nconjugate to \u03c9a (x), \u03c9a (x), A\u03bca respectively. Thus the operators of these quantities in the Schrodinger\npicture are\nZ\n\ni\nh\nd3 k\np\naa\u03bc (k)eik*x + a\u2020a\u03bc (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n2\u03a9(2\u03c0)3\nr h\nZ\ni\n\u03a9\nid3 k\np\naa\u03bc (k)eik*x \u2212 a\u2020a\u03bc (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n\u03a0a\u03bc (x) =\n(2\u03c0)3 2\nZ\ni\nh\nd3 k\n\u2020\np\n\u03c9a(1) (x) =\nC a (k)eik*x + C a (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n2|k|(2\u03c0)3\nr\nZ\ni\n(\u2212i)d3 k |k| h\n(1)\np\nCa (k)eik*x + Ca\u2020 (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n\u03a0a (x) =\n2\n(2\u03c0)3\nZ\ni\n3\n(\u2212i)d k h\np\n\u03c9a(2) (x) =\nCa (k)eik*x \u2212 Ca\u2020 (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n2|k|(2\u03c0)3\nr\nZ\ni\n|k| h\nd3 k\n\u2020\n(2)\np\n\u03a0a (x) =\nC a (k)eik*x \u2212 C a (k)e\u2212ik*x ,\n2\n(2\u03c0)3\nZ\nZ\nn \u2020\no\nH0 = \u2212g \u03bc\u03bd d3 k\u03a9(|k|)a\u2020a\u03bc (k)aa\u03bd (k) + d3 k|k| C a (k)Ca (k) + Ca\u2020 (k)C a (k) + H\u03c80 ,\nAa\u03bc (x) =\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere\np\n\u03a9(|k|) = M 2 + |k|2 ,\nh\ni\naa\u03bc (k), a\u2020b\u03bd (k\u2032 ) = \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4ab \u03b4 3 (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) ,\nh\ni h\ni\naa\u03bc (k), ab\u03bd (k\u2032 ) = a\u2020a\u03bc (k), a\u2020b\u03bd (k\u2032 ) = 0 ,\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\fi\nh\ni\nh\n\u2020\nC a (k), Cb\u2020 (k\u2032 ) = Ca (k), C b (k\u2032 ) = \u03b4ab \u03b4 3 (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) ,\nh\ni+ h\ni+ h\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCa (k), Cb (k ) = C a (k), C b (k ) = Ca (k), C b (k\u2032 )\n+\ni+ h\nh\ni+\n\u2020 \u2032\n\u2020 \u2032\n= C a (k), C b (k ) = Ca (k), Cb (k ) = 0 .\n+\n\n+\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nThe restriction of the Lorentz condition on a physical state |\u03a8ph i can be expressed as\n(k 0 = \u03a9(|k|)) .\n\nk \u03bc aa\u03bc (k)|\u03a8ph i = 0\n\n(17)\n\nFor a single particle state with the polarization vector \u03b5\u03bc (k)\n\u03b5\u03bc (k, \u03bb)a\u2020a\u03bc (k)|0i\n\n(18)\n\nk\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc (k, \u03bb) = 0 .\n\n(19)\n\nEq. (17) gives\n\nAccording to this condition two transversal polarization states (\u03bb = 1, 2) and a longitudinal polarization\nstate (\u03bb = 3) are allowed to be present for each k.\nSince \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c9a (x) = 0 the theory we are treating is invariant under the infinitesimal transformation\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc (x) = \u03b4\u03b6\u2202\u03bc \u03c9a (x) ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c9a (x) = 0 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c9 a (x) = 0 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8(x) = 0 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b6 is an infinitesimal fermionic real constant. Similarly, since \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c9a (x) = 0 the theory is also\ninvariant under the transformation\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc (x) = \u03b4\u03b6\u2202\u03bc \u03c9 a (x) ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c9a (x) = 0 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c9 a (x) = 0 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8(x) = 0 .\n\n(21)\n\nThis is the residual symmetry mentioned above. Under such a kind of transformations a physical state\nshould become an equivalent state. Particularly \u03b5\u03bc (k, \u03bb)\u03b4a\u2020a\u03bc (k)|0i should be equivalent to zero, where\n\u03b4a\u2020a\u03bc (k) is determined by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc (x) = \u03b4\u03b6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c9a t=0 ,\n\n(22)\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc (x) = \u03b4\u03b6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c9 a t=0 .\n\n(23)\n\nor by\n\nFrom (22), one has\n\u03b4a\u2020a\u03bc (k) = i\u03b4\u03b6 e\nk\u03bc\n3\n\np\n\u03a9/|k|Ca\u2020 (k) .\n\n(24)\n\n\fwhere the components of e\nk\u03bc are\n\ne\nk0 = |k| ,\n\ne\nkl = kl .\n\n(25)\n\nSimilarly from (23), one has\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03b4a\u2020a\u03bc (k) = i\u03b4\u03b6 e\nk\u03bc\n\np\n\u2020\n\u03a9/|k|C a (k) .\n\n(26)\n\nIt follows that Ca\u2020 (k)|0i and C a (k)|0i should be equivalent to zero.\nIn conclusion, the initial-final state subspace is formed by all the physical states. A physical state\ncan only contain material particles, transversal polarization or longitudinal polarization gauge Bosons\nand does not contain ghost particles.\nWe are grateful to Professor Yang Li-ming for helpful discussions.
