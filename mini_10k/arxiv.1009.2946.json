The viscosity of a dilute emulsion is ob\u2010\ntained as a function of the volume fraction of dispersed phase. The derived new\nformula is asymptotically correct and more general than the linear relationships\nusually used. The method is applied also for description of the influence of fluc\u2010\ntuations on the transport coefficients.\nThe theory of transport coefficients in composites is arisen and developed in connection\nof particular problems in hydrodynamics and electrostatics. This circumstance, combined by the\nheavy ponderous mathematical techniques typical for such kind of problems, has impeded the\nformulation of a general approach and its further development. Usually, the transport in com\u2010\nposites is considered as a transfer of a field v 0 (hydrodynamic, electrical, thermal, etc.) in a\nmedium with a transport coefficient \uf0680 in the presence of a dispersed phase with a transport\ncoefficient \uf068 . In the simplest case the dispersed phase particles are uniform spheres with radi\u2010\nus R . These particles induce a perturbation field v ' and thus the resulting field equals to\n\nv \uf03d v 0 \uf02b v ' . The aim is to idealize the composite as a homogeneous phase with an effective\ntransport coefficient \uf068eff . The replacement of the real system ( v, \uf0680 , \uf068, R) by an idealized one\n\n( v 0 , \uf068eff ) reduces the problem to determination of \uf068eff (\uf0680 , \uf068, R) . In the literature three ap\u2010\nproaches to this problem are developed:\n(i) Expressing of the perturbation field, induced by an ensemble of spheres, by the pertur\u2010\nbation of an effective single sphere. This idea belongs to Maxwell [1] and historically it is\nthe first method for calculation of effective transport coefficients. Originally it has been\napplied to the Ohmic resistance of composites;\n(ii) Juxtaposition of fluxes in the real and idealized systems. This idea is proposed by Burg\u2010\ners [2], who applied it for obtaining the effective viscosity of suspensions. This method\nhas been further developed and systematically applied by Landau and Lifshitz in hydro\u2010\ndynamics [3] and electrostatics [4];\n(iii) Comparison of energy consumption in the real and idealized systems. This is the well\u2010\nknown Einstein method in hydrodynamics balancing the energy of dissipation [5]. In op\u2010\ntics one could consider the extinction as an effective property.\nThe Maxwell approach has some advantages in formal aspects as well as in the possibility for\ngeneralization. These features are demonstrated in the present study by obtaining a general\n\n\fexpression for the effective viscosity of dispersions as well as in the study of the role of fluctua\u2010\ntions on the transport coefficients.\nViscosity of dilute heterogeneous systems\nLet us consider uniform spherical droplets with radius R and viscosity \uf068 dispersed in a\nliquid with viscosity \uf0680 . An external deformation velocity field v 0 \uf03d \uf0440 \uf0d7 r acts on this emulsion.\nSince the fluid is incompressible, \uf0d1 \uf0d7 v 0 \uf03d 0 , the constant symmetric tensor \uf0440 should possess a\nzero trace. Each droplet causes a Stokes field v ' around itself decreasing asymptotically at large\ndistances as a dipole one\n\nv '(r \uf0ae \uf0a5) \uf0ae 2.5\uf067R3r \uf0d7 \uf0440 \uf0d7 rr / r 5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r \uf03d r is the distance from the droplet center and \uf067 is a coefficient reflecting the inter\u2010\naction of the fields inside and outside of the droplet. All types of such interactions lie in the\nframes of two limit models for immiscible and miscible fluids, respectively, [6]\n\n\uf067 \uf03d (\uf068 \uf02b 2.5) / (\uf068 \uf02b 1)\n\n\uf067 \uf03d (\uf068 \uf02d 1) / (\uf068 \uf02b 1.5)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \uf068 \uf0ba \uf068 / \uf0680 . The difference between these two models is in the transition of the stress\ntensor across the droplet surface. In the case of immiscible fluids the stress tensor components\njump due to a surface tension, while for miscible fluids the stress tensor is continuous since the\nsurface tension is zero. The widely employed case of suspensions of solid spheres in a viscous\nfluid corresponds to interaction coefficient \uf067 \uf03d 1 since \uf068 \uf0ae \uf0a5 .\nLet us consider a hypothetical sphere with radius Reff placed in the emulsion and con\u2010\ntaining n smaller droplets. This ensemble of droplets will cause a perturbation field v ' \uf03d \uf0e5 v 'i .\nFollowing the Maxwell approach the same sphere is idealized as a droplet of homogeneous\nfluid with viscosity \uf068eff placed in the original surrounding pure fluid. Note that the idealized\nsphere should be considered as miscible one as far as no physical boundary with the surround\u2010\ning fluid exists. Let us mark the perturbation field of the effective sphere as v 'eff . Then accord\u2010\ning to the potential theory at large distances the two perturbation fields should coincide\n\nv 'eff (r \uf0ae \uf0a5) \uf03d \uf0e5 v 'i (r \uf0ae \uf0a5)\n\n(3)\n\nsince neutrally buoyant particles (particles moving along the streamlines without delay) gener\u2010\nate at low Reynolds number dipole fields at large distances [7], i.e. v '(r \uf0ae \uf0a5) \uf0ae 1/ r 2 as ex\u2010\npressed in Eq. (1). The next step is to consider the resultant field of a droplet in ensemble as the\n\n\fperturbation field of a single droplet. Generally, between the droplets exist hydrodynamic in\u2010\nteractions and then the external field \uf044 acting on a single particle will be perturbed by the\ngenerated fields of the neighboring droplets. As discussed below, the Maxwell approach suc\u2010\nceeds to account in part for these interactions by the help of the unperturbed external field, i.e.\n3\nvia \uf0440 \uf03d \uf044(\uf066 \uf03c\uf03c 1) where \uf066 \uf03d nR3 / Reff\nis the volume fraction of the dispersed phase in the\n\nemulsion. At higher concentrations \uf066 \uf0bb 1 there are some restrictions for applying the asymptot\u2010\nic Eq. (1) which will be discussed later.\nFor relatively diluted emulsions of uniformly distributed droplets, the effective perturba\u2010\ntion field from Eq. (3) can be expressed by the perturbation field caused by a single droplet v '1 ,\n\nv 'eff (\uf066 \uf03c\uf03c 1) \uf03d nv '1 . Introducing Eq. (1) in this relation yields\n\n\uf067 eff (\uf068eff ) \uf03d \uf067 (\uf068)\uf066\n\n(4)\n\nwith \uf068eff \uf0ba \uf068eff / \uf0680 . Note that the interaction coefficient of the single droplet \uf067 obeys the first\nexpression from Eq. (2), while the coefficient \uf067 eff of the effective sphere obeys the second one.\nUsing them it leads to the final result for the effective viscosity of dilute emulsion\n\n\uf068eff \uf03d 1 \uf02b 2.5\uf067\uf066 / (1 \uf02d \uf067\uf066)\n\n(5)\n\nThis relation contains many of the existing in the literature results of dilute emulsions [5, 8\u201010].\nAs is seen, it is more general than the Einstein approximate formula \uf068eff \uf03d 1 \uf02b 2.5\uf067\uf066 . The nature\nof the non\u2010linear dependence in Eq. (5) is the same as that in the well\u2010known Lorentz\u2010Lorenz or\nClausius\u2010Mossotti equation discussed later [see Eq. (15)]. The collective effects can be account\u2010\ned for also by consecutive 'dilution' of the droplets in an effective environment. Since the vol\u2010\nume fraction of a single droplet \uf0661 \uf03d \uf066 / n is always low the effective viscosity of an emulsion\nfrom i \uf02b 1 droplets can be related to the effective viscosity from i droplets via the Einstein\nformula \uf068i \uf02b1 / \uf068i \uf03d 1 \uf02b 2.5\uf067\uf0661 . Multiplying now these expressions yields for the effective viscosity\nof the emulsion \uf068eff \uf03d (1 \uf02b 2.5\uf067\uf066 / n) n \uf0ae exp(2.5\uf067\uf066) , where the last approximate expression is\nvalid for large total number of droplets n . This non\u2010linear dependence seems, however, less\naccurate than Eq. (5), since it does not diverge at \uf067\uf066 \uf0ae 1 as physically required.\nTransport coefficients and fluctuations\nThe role of fluctuations on transport coefficients is important for homogeneous systems\nas well as for composites. The problem can be reduced to a statistical analysis of the difference\n\uf044\uf068eff \uf0ba \uf068eff \uf02d \uf03c \uf068 \uf03e as a function of \uf044x \uf0ba x \uf02d \uf03c x \uf03e , where x indicates density, temperature or\nother thermodynamic parameters of the system. The average quantities, denoted by brackets,\n\n\fcorrespond to the equilibrium values. Considering the fluctuations as particles dispersed in a\nhomogeneous medium, the logic of the previous section leads to Eq. (4) again\n\n\uf067 (\uf068eff ) \uf03d \uf067 (\uf068)\uf046\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \uf046 is the volume fraction of fluctuations and \uf067 is the interaction coefficient between the\nmiscible regions with parameters \uf068 and \uf03c \uf068 \uf03e .\nIn the frames of the linear non\u2010equilibrium thermodynamics the steady state transport\n(thermal, diffusive, electrical, etc.) between a sphere and infinitive surrounding medium formu\u2010\nlates one and the same boundary problem: determination of potential functions inside and out\u2010\nside the sphere with continuous fluxes across the boundary. To remind, the fluxes continuity\ntakes place, when there is no physical boundary or if the real boundary shows negligible specific\nresponse. From the universality of the boundary problems it follows the universality of the rela\u2010\ntion between the interaction and transport coefficients [compare to Eq. (2)]\n\n\uf067 \uf03d \uf064 / (1 \uf02b \uf064)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \uf064 \uf0ba (\uf068 \uf02d 1) / a and \uf068 \uf03d \uf068/ \uf03c \uf068 \uf03e . The factor a is a number being 2.5 for viscosity [see Eq.\n(1)] and 3 for thermal conductivity, diffusion and dielectric permeability. Note that we do not\nconsider here phase transitions and related surface tension effects.\nIn analogy with the previous section the system of Eqs. (6) and (7) give the following re\u2010\nsult of \uf068eff , developed in series of \uf044\uf068 up to the quadratic power term\n\n\uf044\uf068eff \uf03d \uf068eff / \uf03c \uf068 \uf03e \uf02d1 \uf03d \uf046\uf044\uf068 \uf02d \uf046 (1 \uf02d \uf046 )(\uf044\uf068) 2 / a\n\n(8)\n\nOn the other hand \uf044\uf068 is related with the fluctuation parameter \uf044x via the phenomenological\ndependence \uf068( x)\n\n\uf044\uf068 \uf03d \uf068/ \uf03c \uf068 \uf03e \uf02d1 \uf03d\uf03c \uf068 ' \uf03e \uf044x \uf02b \uf03c \uf068\" \uf03e (\uf044x)2 / 2 \uf02b \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the derivatives \uf03c \uf068 ' \uf03e and \uf03c \uf068 \" \uf03e refer to the equilibrium state. The combination of Eqs.\n(8) and (9) yields the following results for the first two average moments of \uf044\uf068eff\n\n\uf03c \uf044\uf068eff \uf03e\uf03d \uf046[\uf03c \uf068 \" \uf03e /2 \uf02d (1 \uf02d \uf046 ) \uf03c \uf068 ' \uf03e 2 / a] \uf03c (\uf044x) 2 \uf03e\n\n(10)\n\n\uf03c (\uf044\uf068eff )2 \uf03e\uf03d \uf046 2 \uf03c \uf068 ' \uf03e2 \uf03c (\uf044x)2 \uf03e\n\n(11)\n\n\fAt equilibrium \uf03c \uf044x \uf03e\uf03d 0 , while the dispersion \uf03c (\uf044x)2 \uf03e is given by the corresponding ther\u2010\nmodynamic relation.\nWe will apply the above results to two different systems to illustrate the role of fluctua\u2010\ntions on the transfer in a composite and in a homogeneous system. Let us consider first viscosi\u2010\nty fluctuations in an emulsion. Here the equilibrium corresponds to homogeneous droplet con\u2010\ncentration with transport coefficient from Eq. (5) and x \uf0ba \uf066 . Expressing the derivatives in Eqs.\n(10) and (11) by Eq. (5) yields the following expressions for the leading terms at a \uf03d 2.5\n\n\uf03c \uf044\uf068eff \uf03e\uf03d 2.5\uf046(1.5\uf067 \uf02b \uf046 / \uf066) \uf067 2\uf066 \uf03c (\uf044\uf066)2 \uf03e\n\n(12)\n\n\uf03c (\uf044\uf068eff ) 2 \uf03e1/2 \uf03d 2.5\uf046\uf067 \uf03c (\uf044\uf066) 2 \uf03e1/2\n\n(13)\n\nThe ratio \uf046 / \uf066 is kept in Eq. (12) as far its order of magnitude is unknown; note that the inter\u2010\naction coefficients at low Reynolds numbers are between 1 for solid and 2.5 for fluid spheres.\nThe dispersion \uf03c (\uf044\uf066)2 \uf03e is related to the particles concentration c and for dilute solutions one\ncan express it as follows\n\n\uf03c (\uf044\uf066)2 \uf03e\uf03d v 2 \uf03c (\uf044c)2 \uf03e\uf03d \uf066v / V\n\n(14)\n\nwhere v is the volume of a single droplet and V is the average volume of a fluctuation region.\nAs a second example let us describe the dielectric permittivity fluctuations in a homogeneous\nmedium. The dependence of dielectric permittivity \uf065 as a function of the density \uf072 in an equi\u2010\nlibrium system is given by the Lorentz\u2010Lorenz equation, which is analogical to Eq.

As is known, the Lorentz\u2010Lorenz equation is obtained\nalso via the Maxwell approach and \uf065 is an effective quantity from microscopic point of view\n[11]. Following the procedures of the previous example, it is easy to obtain that\n\n\uf03c \uf044\uf065eff \uf03e\uf03d \uf046(\uf065 \uf02b 2)(\uf065 \uf02d 1) 2 [2(\uf065 \uf02d 1) \uf02b \uf046 (\uf065 \uf02b 2)]k BT \uf06b / 27\uf065V\n\n(16)\n\nHere the density fluctuations \uf03c (\uf044\uf072) 2 \uf03d k BT \uf06b \uf03c \uf072 \uf03e 2 /V are presented via the isothermic com\u2010\npressibility \uf06b \uf03d (\uf0b6 ln \uf072 / \uf0b6p)T . In the both examples above the average fluctuating volume V\nappears as a parameter, which will be discussed in the next section.\n\n\fDiscussion\nThe central assumption of the derivation of the effective viscosity in Eq. (5) is actually\nthe dipole character at large distances of the perturbed field v ' caused by a droplet placed in\nan external field v 0 [see Eq. (1)]. A general question is about the range of validity of the relation\nbetween v ' and v 0 as a function of the droplet concentration. Of course, at higher particle\nconcentration each droplet will be influenced by the field of the surrounding ones but in the\ncase of a stationary homogeneous particles distribution the field can be only a deformation one\naccording the Faxen theorem [7]. This is equivalent to an external field tensor \uf044 with the same\ncharacteristics (symmetry and zero trace) as \uf0440 . At a first look, the existence of this defor\u2010\nmation field guarantees the validity of Eq. (5) at any particles concentration [note that the rela\u2010\ntion (5) is independent of \uf044 ], but the problem is that at higher concentrations the distances\nbetween particles are not large enough and the other faster decreasing components of v ' can\u2010\nnot be neglected anymore. Thus the problem of the validity of Eq. (5) becomes equivalent with\nthe validity range of dipole approximation (1).\nThe fluctuations as a source of non\u2010homogeneities bring some specific problems in the\ntransport theory, such as what is the order of the fraction \uf046 of fluctuations, the average vol\u2010\nume of a fluctuation V , etc. We will restrict ourselves within the concept of complete correla\u2010\ntion inside the volume V . The average concentration of fluctuations C \uf03d \uf046 / V appears in Eqs.\n(12) and (16). In the statistical physics the volume of a correlation domain reflects the interac\u2010\ntions between the particles but the volume V should also depend on the dissipative character\u2010\nistics since the fluctuations are dissipative structures. For instance, in the case of independent\nparticles (an ideal gas) the correlation length is of the order of the mean free path \uf06c \uf03a 1/ \uf072d 2\n[12], where d is the diameter of the molecules and \uf072 is the gas density. Due to isotropy the\nfluctuation volume reads V \uf03a \uf06c3 \uf03a 1/ \uf072\uf0662 . Now we can estimate the dispersion from Eq. (14),\n\n\uf03c (\uf044\uf066)2 \uf03e\uf03a \uf0664 , and the first two moments of the effective viscosity from Eqs. (12) and (13), re\u2010\nspectively, \uf03c \uf044\uf068eff \uf03e\uf03a \uf046\uf067 3\uf0665 and \uf03c (\uf044\uf068eff ) 2 \uf03e\uf03a \uf046 2 \uf067 2 \uf0664 . Hence, our analysis shows the presence\nof small but widely distributed viscosity fluctuations since \uf03c (\uf044\uf068eff ) 2 \uf03e / \uf03c \uf044\uf068eff \uf03e 2 \uf03a 1/ \uf067 4 \uf0666 \uf03e 1 .\nThe only topic related to our problem is the effect of the Brownian motion of hard spheres (\n\n\uf067 \uf03d 1 ) on the effective viscosity [13, 14]. The Batchelor result \uf044\uf068eff \uf03a \uf0662 corresponds well to our\nexpression for the viscosity root mean square variation \uf03c (\uf044\uf068eff ) 2 \uf03e1/2 , which is, however, ex\u2010\npected since Batchelor considered only the linear dependence of the viscosity on the particle\nvolume fraction. Note that \uf03c \uf044\uf068eff \uf03e\uf03d 0 in this case.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\nJ.C.A. Maxwell, Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, Dower, New York, 1954\nJ.M.
