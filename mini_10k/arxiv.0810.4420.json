We define a notion of symmetric monoidal closed (smc) theory, consisting of a smc signature augmented with equations, and describe the classifying categories of such theories in terms of proof nets.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this note, in preparation for a sequel using symmetric monoidal closed (smc)\ncategories to reconstruct Jensen and Milner's [2004] bigraphs, we define a notion of smc theory, and give a graphical presentation of the free smc category\ngenerated by such a theory.\n1.1\n\nSymmetric monoidal closed theories\n\nRecall that a many-sorted algebraic theory is specified by first giving a signature-a set of sorts X and a set \u03a3 of operations with arities-together with\na set of equations over that signature. For example, the theory for monoids is\nspecified by taking only one sort x, and operations\nm: x \u00d7 x \u2192 x\n\nand\n\ne : 1 \u2192 x,\n\ntogether with the usual associativity and unitality equations. We may equally\nwell view this signature as given by a graph\nx\u00d7x\n\nm\n\n\u2732 x\u271b\n\ne\n\n1\n\nwhose vertices are labelled by objects of the free category with finite products\ngenerated by X. In this paper, we follow the same route, but replacing from\nthe start finite products with symmetric monoidal closed structure. Thus, an\nsmc signature is given by a set of sorts X, together with a graph with vertices\nin the free smc category generated by X, so that instead of cartesian product,\nwe have available the logical connectives of Girard [1987, 1993]'s Intuitionistic\nMultiplicative Linear Logic (henceforth imll): a tensor product \u2297, its right\nadjoint \u22b8, and its unit I. This permits idioms from higher-order abstract syntax\n[Pfenning and Elliott, 1988], e.g., taking the graph\n(x \u22b8 x)\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u2732 x\u271b\n\n@\n\n(x \u2297 x)\n\n(1)\n\n\fas a signature. An smc theory is now given by a smc signature, together with\na set of equations over that signature. This notion of theory gives rise to a\nfunctorial semantics in the sense of Lawvere [1963], the crux of which is the\nfollowing. We may define a notion of model for an smc theory in an arbitrary\nsmc category, and may associate to each smc theory T a classifying category\nCT : this being a small smc category for which strict smc functors CT \u2192 D are\nin bijection with models of T in D. The existence of CT follows from general\nconsiderations of categorical universal algebra; but the description this gives of\nCT is syntactic. The main purpose of this paper is to give a graphical presentation\nof CT . Its objects will be imll formulae, while its morphisms are variants of\nHughes' [2005] proof nets, satisfying a correctness criterion familiar from Danos\nand Regnier's [1989].\n1.2\n\nRelated work\n\nThere is an extensive literature devoted to describing free smc categories of the\nkind we consider here. In their seminal work on coherence for closed categories,\nKelly and Mac Lane [1971] introduced what are now known as Kelly-MacLane\ngraphs, but did not go so far as to obtain a characterisation of free smc categories. Such a construction was first carried out by Trimble [1994], and subsequently Blute et al. [1996] and Tan [1997], using ideas taken from Girard's [1987,\n1993] proof nets (actually, Blute et al. [1996] construct the free star-autonomous\ncategory, but the free smc category is obtained as its full subcategory of imll\nformulae). Variations on this theme are presented by Lamarche and Strassburger\n[2006] and Hughes [2005]. In all cases, morphisms are roughly equivalence classes\nof proof nets, with variations in the presentation. In our sequel to this paper, we\nwish to make use of Hughes' presentation, mainly because:\n\u2013 it reduces the graphical burden to the minimum: where others introduce\nnodes corresponding to linear logical connectives, Hughes does not;\n\u2013 its composition behaves nicely: it is defined on representatives and given by\na straightforward gluing of graphs, where others rely on tricky mechanisms,\ne.g., Trimble's [1994] rewiring.\nOn the other hand, Hughes' equivalence classes of proof nets have the inconvenience of lacking normal forms, which, e.g., Trimble's enjoy.\nHowever, Hughes only construct the free smc over a set, which merely accounts for the sorts of a signature. Thus we must extend his construction to deal\nwith an arbitrary smc theory, which we do by reducing from the general case to\nthat of a free smc on a set. Cheng [2003] observed a relationship between trees\nand Kelly-MacLane graphs, of which our result is essentially a generalisation.\n\n2\n\nSymmetric monoidal closed theories\n\nGiven a set X, we write X for the set of symmetric monoidal closed (henceforth\nsmc) types over X; it is inductively generated by the following grammar:\ne ::= x | I | e \u2297 e | e \u22b8 e\n\n(where x \u2208 X).\n\n\fBy a smc signature, we mean a quadruple (X, \u03a3, s, t) where X is a set of ground\ntypes, \u03a3 a set of ground terms, and s, t : \u03a3 \u2192 X are source and target arity\nfunctions. We may also write \u03a3(a, b) for the set of f \u2208 \u03a3 for which s(f ) = a and\nt(f ) = b. For each smc signature, we inductively generate the set \u03a3 of derived\nterms, together with source and target functions s, t : \u03a3 \u2192 X, as follows. We\nrequire that for each f \u2208 \u03a3(a, b), we have f \u2208 \u03a3(a, b); for each a, b, c \u2208 X, we\nhave\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1abc \u2208 \u03a3 a \u2297 (b \u2297 c), (a \u2297 b) \u2297 c ; \u03b1\u22121\nabc \u2208 \u03a3 (a \u2297 b) \u2297 c, a \u2297 (b \u2297 c) ;\n\u03bba \u2208 \u03a3(I \u2297 a, a);\n\n\u03bb\u22121\na \u2208 \u03a3(a, I \u2297 a);\n\n\u03c1a \u2208 \u03a3(a \u2297 I, a);\n\n\u03c1\u22121\na \u2208 \u03a3(a, a \u2297 I);\n\n\u03c3ab \u2208 \u03a3 a \u2297 b, b \u2297 a);\n\n\u01ebab \u2208 \u03a3 (a \u22b8 b) \u2297 a, b\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\nand \u03b7ab \u2208 \u03a3 a, b \u22b8 (a \u2297 b) ;\nfor each f \u2208 \u03a3(a, b) and g \u2208 \u03a3(b, c), we have g \u25e6 f \u2208 \u03a3(a, c); for each a \u2208 X,\nwe have ida \u2208 \u03a3(a, a); and for each f \u2208 \u03a3(a, b) and g \u2208 \u03a3(c, d), we have\nf \u2297 g \u2208 \u03a3(a \u2297 b, c \u2297 d) and f \u22b8 g \u2208 \u03a3(c \u22b8 b, a \u22b8 d). By an equation over a\nsmc signature, we mean a string of the form u = v : a \u2192 b for some a, b \u2208 X and\nu, v \u2208 \u03a3(a, b); and by a syntactic smc theory we mean an smc signature (X, \u03a3)\ntogether with a set E of equations over it.\nExample 1.\n\u2013 The syntactic theory of monoids has a single ground sort x, ground terms\ne \u2208 \u03a3(I, x) and m \u2208 \u03a3(x \u2297 x, x), and three equations\n(m \u25e6 (m \u2297 idx )) \u25e6 \u03b1xxx = m \u25e6 (idx \u2297 m) : x \u2297 (x \u2297 x) \u2192 x\nm \u25e6 (e \u2297 idx ) = \u03bbx : I \u2297 x \u2192 x\nm \u25e6 (idx \u2297 e) = \u03c1x : x \u2297 I \u2192 x.\n\u2013 The syntactic theory of the linear lambda-calculus has a single ground sort\nx and two terms, \u03bb \u2208 \u03a3(x \u22b8 x, x) and @ \u2208 \u03a3(x \u2297 x, x). Its single equation\nis the \u03b2-rule\n@ \u25e6 (\u03bb \u2297 idx ) = \u01ebxx : (x \u22b8 x) \u2297 x \u2192 x.\nGiven a syntactic theory T and a smc category D, we may define a notion of\ninterpretation F : T \u2192 D. Such an F is given by a function FX : X \u2192 ob D\ninterpreting the ground types of the theory, together with a family of functions\n\u0001\n(for a, b \u2208 X)\nFa,b : \u03a3(a, b) \u2192 D FX (a), FX (b)\ninterpreting the basic terms; here we write FX for the unique extension of FX\nto a function X \u2192 ob D commuting with the smc type constructors. These data\nare required to satisfy each of the equations of the theory, in the sense that\nu = v : a \u2192 b in E\n\n\u21d2\n\nFa,b (u) = Fa,b (v) : FX (a) \u2192 FX (b) in D.\n\n\u0001\nHere Fa,b denotes the unique extension of Fa,b to a function \u03a3(a, b) \u2192 D FX (a), FX (b)\ncommuting with the smc term constructors.\n\n\fExample 2.\n\u2013 An interpretation in D of the theory of monoids is a monoid in D.\n\u2013 An interpretation in D of the theory of the linear lambda-calculus is given by\nan object X \u2208 D and maps \u03bb : X \u22b8 X \u2192 X and @ : X \u2297 X \u2192 X rendering\ncommutative the diagram\n\u03bb\u2297X\n\n// X \u2297 X\n(X \u22b8 X) \u2297 X\nOOO\nOOO\nO\n@\n\u01ebX,X OOO\nOO'' \u000f\u000f\nX.\nProperty 1. To each syntactic theory T = (X, \u03a3, E) we may assign a small smc\ncategory CT which classifies T, in the sense that there is a bijection, natural in\nD, between interpretations T \u2192 D and strict smc functors CT \u2192 D.\nProof. We take the set of objects of CT to be X, and obtain its homsets by\nquotienting the sets \u03a3(a, b) under the smallest congruence which contains each\nequation in E; makes composition associative and unital; makes \u2297 and \u22b8 functorial in each variable; makes \u03b1, \u03bb, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u01eb and \u03b7 natural in each variable; makes\nthe \u03bb\u22121 's, \u03c1\u22121 's and \u03b1\u22121 's inverse to the \u03bb's, \u03c1's and \u03b1's; verifies the triangle\nidentities for \u03b7 and \u01eb; and verifies the symmetric monoidal category axioms of\nMac Lane.\nObserve that different syntactic theories T and T\u2032 may give rise to the same\nclassifying category CT = CT\u2032 , and so have the same models. Thus, in the spirit\nof categorical logic, one should view syntactic smc theories as presentations of\ntheir classifying categories; so that to understand a syntactic theory T is really\nto understand the category CT . The purpose of this note is to improve this\nunderstanding by giving a graphical representation of CT , in which morphisms\nare viewed as certain equivalence classes of diagrams. In the case where our\ntheory has no equations, and our signature no operations, we are considering a\nmere set of types X, and the corresponding smc category CX is the free smc\ncategory on X. We have mentioned that in this case we want to use Hughes'\n[2005] representation. We will show that this special case suffices to derive the\ngeneral one. In fact, it will suffice to derive the case of a free theory-one given\nby a signature (X, \u03a3) subject to no equations-since the classifying category of\nan arbitrary theory may be obtained by quotienting out the morphisms of the\nclassifying category of a free theory, so that a graphical representation of the\nlatter induces a graphical representation of the former.\nGiven a free theory (X, \u03a3), we will obtain a graphical representation of the\ncorresponding classifying category CX,\u03a3 by first describing it in terms of CX , the\nfree smc category on X, and then making use of a suitable graphical description\nof the latter. We begin by introducing some notation. We define the typing\nfunction ty : \u03a3 \u2192 ob CX = X by ty(\u03b1) = s(\u03b1) \u22b8 t(\u03b1), and extend this to a\n\n\ffunction on \u03a3 \u2217 , the set of lists in \u03a3, by taking\n\nand\n\nty() = I,\nty(\u03b1) = s(\u03b1) \u22b8 t(\u03b1),\nty(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) = ty(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n\u22121 ) \u2297 ty(\u03b1n ) for n > 2.\n\nThough we may not have equality between ty(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) \u2297 ty(\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m ) and\nty(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n , \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m ), we can at least build a canonical isomorphism between\nthem in CX using the associativity and unitality constraints. Similarly, for \u03c3 a\npermutation on n letters, we can construct canonical maps\n\u03c3\u0302 : ty(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) \u2192 ty(\u03b1\u03c3(1) , . . . , \u03b1\u03c3(n) )\n\u2032\nusing the symmetry isomorphisms of CX . We now define a category CX,\u03a3\nof\nwhich the classifying category CX,\u03a3 will be a quotient.\n\n\u2013 Objects are objects of CX ;\n\u2013 Morphisms U \u2192 V are given by a list \u0393 \u2208 \u03a3 \u2217 together with a morphism\n\u03c6 : ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U \u2192 V\nin CX .\n\u2013 Identity maps U \u2192 U are given by the empty list () together with the\ncanonical isomorphism I \u2297 U \u2192 U ;\n\u2013 Composition of maps (\u0393, \u03c6) : U \u2192 V and (\u2206, \u03c8) : V \u2192 W is given by the\nmap (\u2206 + \u0393, \u03be) : U \u2192 W , wherein \u2206 + \u0393 is the concatenation of the two\nlists, and \u03be is the composite morphism\nty(\u2206 + \u0393 ) \u2297 U\n\nW\n\u273b\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2744\n\u0001\nty(\u2206) \u2297 ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u2732 ty(\u2206) \u2297 V\n\nty(\u2206) \u2297 \u03c6\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThe category CX,\u03a3\nadmits an embedding functor i : CX \u2192 CX,\u03a3\n, which is the\nidentity on objects, and on morphisms sends a map \u03c6 : U \u2192 V to the pair of the\nempty list () together with the composite\n\u223c\n=\n\nI \u2297U\n\n\u2732 U\n\n\u2732 V.\n\n\u03c6\n\nIt also admits a tensor operation, which on objects is inherited from CX ; and\non morphisms takes a pair of maps (\u0393, \u03c6) : U \u2192 V and (\u0393 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) : U \u2032 \u2192 V \u2032 to the\nmap (\u0393 + \u0393 \u2032 , \u03b8) : U \u2297 U \u2032 \u2192 V \u2297 V \u2032 , where \u03b8 is the composite\nty(\u0393 + \u0393 \u2032 ) \u2297 (U \u2297 U \u2032 )\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u2032\n\nV \u2297 V \u2032.\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n(ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U ) \u2297 (ty(\u0393 \u2032 ) \u2297 U \u2032 )\n\nHowever, this tensor operation does not underlie a tensor product in the usual\nsense; for whilst functorial in each variable separately, it does not satisfy the\n\n\fcompatibility conditions required to obtain a functor of two variables. These\nrequire the commutativity of squares of the form\nU \u2297 U\u2032\nU \u2297 f\u2032\n\n\u2744\nU \u2297V\u2032\n\n\u2732 V \u2297 U\u2032\n\nf \u2297 U\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nV \u2297 f\u2032\n\n\u2744\nf \u2297V\n\u2732 V \u2297 V \u2032;\n\u2032\n\nbut we see from the definitions that, for f = (\u0393, \u03c6) and f \u2032 = (\u0393 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) as above,\nthe upper composite in (2) has its first component given by \u0393 \u2032 + \u0393 , whilst the\n\u2032\nlower has it given by \u0393 + \u0393 \u2032 ; so that CX,\u03a3\nis not a smc category. Nonetheless,\nwe do have that:\n\u2032\nProperty 2. CX,\u03a3\nis a symmetric premonoidal category in the sense of Power\n\u2032\nand Robinson [1997], and the embedding i : CX \u2192 CX,\u03a3\nis a strict symmetric\npremonoidal functor.\n\u2032\nProof. Beyond the structure we have already noted, this means that CX,\u03a3\ncomes\nequipped with a unit object, which we take to be I, the unit object of CX ; and\nwith isomorphisms of associativity, unitality and symmetry of the same form as\nthose for a symmetric monoidal category, but differing from them in two aspects.\nFirst, they need only be natural in each variable separately; so for symmetry,\nfor instance, we only require diagrams of the following form to commute:\n\nU \u2297V\n\n\u2732 U \u2297V\u2032\n\nU \u2297g\n\n\u03c3U,V\n\n\u2744\nV \u2297U\n\n\u03c3U,V \u2032\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 V\u2032\u2297U\n\ng\u2297U\n\nU \u2297V\nand\n\n\u2732 U\u2032 \u2297 V\n\nf \u2297V\n\n\u03c3U,V\n\n\u03c3U \u2032 ,V\n\n\u2744\nV \u2297U\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 V \u2297 U \u2032.\n\nV \u2297f\n\nSecondly, the constraint isomorphisms are required to be central maps, where\nf : U \u2192 V is said to be central just when for each f \u2032 : U \u2032 \u2192 V \u2032 , the diagram (2)\nand its dual\nU\u2032 \u2297 f\n\u2732 U\u2032 \u2297 V\nU\u2032 \u2297 U\nf\u2032 \u2297 U\n\n\u2744\nV\u2032\u2297U\n\nf\u2032 \u2297 V\n\n\u2744\nV\u2032 \u2297f\n\u2732 V\u2032\u2297V\n\n\u2032\nare rendered commutative. In the case of CX,\u03a3\n, we fulfil these demands by taking\n\u2032\neach coherence constraint in CX,\u03a3 to be the image of the corresponding coherence\n\u2032\nconstraint in CX under i : CX \u2192 CX,\u03a3\n. Naturality in each variable is easily\n\u2032\nchecked; whilst centrality follows by observing that a map of CX,\u03a3\nis central iff\nit lies in the image of the aforementioned embedding. Finally, we observe that\n\u2032\npreserves all the structure of CX on the nose, and\nthe embedding i : CX \u2192 CX,\u03a3\nsends central maps to central maps; and so is strict symmetric premonoidal.\n\n\f\u2032\nIn fact, CX,\u03a3\nis closed as a premonoidal category in the sense that for each\n\u2032\nV \u2208 CX,\u03a3 , the endofunctor (\u2013) \u2297 V has a right adjoint V \u22b8 (\u2013) which preserves\ncentral maps, with the units and counits\n\nU \u2212\u2192 V \u22b8 (U \u2297 V )\n\nand\n\n(V \u22b8 W ) \u2297 V \u2212\u2192 W\n\nof these adjunctions being central. Indeed, we may take the action of V \u22b8 (\u2013)\non objects to be given as in CX ; and then we have:\na\n\u0001\n\u2032\nCX,\u03a3\n(U \u2297 V, W ) =\nCX ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 (U \u2297 V ), W\n\u0393 \u2208\u03a3 \u2217\n\n\u223c\n=\n=\n\na\n\nCX ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U, V \u22b8 W\n\n\u0393 \u2208\u03a3 \u2217\n\u2032\nCX,\u03a3\n(U,\n\n\u0001\n\nV \u22b8 W ),\n\nnaturally in U and W , as desired. The centrality requirements now amount to\nthe fact that the adjunctions\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2192 CX,\u03a3\n(\u2013) \u2297 V \u22a3 V \u22b8 (\u2013) : CX,\u03a3\n\nmay be restricted and corestricted to adjunctions\n(\u2013) \u2297 V \u22a3 V \u22b8 (\u2013) : CX \u2192 CX .\n\u2032\nThe reason that CX,\u03a3\nis only premonoidal rather than monoidal is that its\nmorphisms are built from a list, rather than a multiset of generating operations:\nin computational terms, we may think that a morphism \"remembers the order in\nwhich its generating operations are executed\". To rectify this, we quotient out the\n\u2032\nmorphisms of CX,\u03a3\nby the action of the symmetric groups; the result will be the\nsmc category CX,\u03a3 we seek. So let there be given a list \u0393 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) \u2208 \u03a3 \u2217 ,\na permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn , and a morphism \u03c6 : ty(\u03c3\u0393 ) \u2297 U \u2192 V in CX , where \u03c3\u0393\nis the list (\u03b1\u03c3(1) , . . . , \u03b1\u03c3(n) ). A generating element for our congruence \u223c on the\n\u2032\nmorphisms of CX,\u03a3\nis now given by\n\n(\u03c3\u0393, \u03c6)\n\n\u223c\n\n(\u0393, \u03c6 \u25e6 (\u03c3\u0302 \u2297 U ))\n\nwhere we recall that \u03c3\u0302 is the canonical morphism ty(\u0393 ) \u2192 ty(\u03c3\u0393 ) built from\nsymmetry and associativity maps in CX . We may now verify that for morphisms\nU\n\nf\n\n\u2732 V\n\ng\n\n\u2732\n\u2732 W\n\nk\n\n\u2732 Z\n\nh\n\u2032\nin CX,\u03a3\n, g \u223c h implies both gf \u223c hf and kg \u223c kh, so that \u223c is a congruence on\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCX,\u03a3 , and we may define the category CX,\u03a3 to be the quotient of CX,\u03a3\nby \u223c.\n\nProperty 3. CX,\u03a3 is a symmetric monoidal closed category, and the quotient map\n\u2032\nq : CX,\u03a3\n\u2192 CX,\u03a3 is a strict symmetric premonoidal functor.\n\n\f\u2032\nProof. Straightforward checking shows that if f \u223c f \u2032 and g \u223c g \u2032 in CX,\u03a3\n, then\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf \u2297 g \u223c f \u2297 g , so that the tensor operation on CX,\u03a3 passes to the quotient CX,\u03a3 .\nFor this operation to define a bifunctor on CX,\u03a3 , we must verify that squares of\nthe form (2) commute in CX,\u03a3 : and this follows by checking that\n\n(f \u2297 V \u2032 ) \u25e6 (U \u2297 f \u2032 ) \u223c (V \u2297 f \u2032 ) \u25e6 (f \u2297 U \u2032 )\n\u2032\nin CX,\u03a3\n. This defines our binary tensor on CX,\u03a3 ; whilst the nullary tensor we\n\u2032\ninherit from CX,\u03a3\n. The associativity, unitality and symmetry constraints in the\n\u2032\ncategory CX,\u03a3 are obtained as the image of the corresponding constraints in CX,\u03a3\nunder the quotient map. Commutativity of the triangle, pentagon and hexagon\n\u2032\naxioms is inherited; whilst the (restricted) naturality of these maps in CX,\u03a3\nbecomes their (full) naturality in CX,\u03a3 . Thus CX,\u03a3 is symmetric monoidal. It is\n\u2032\n\u2032\nnow easy to check that the isomorphisms CX,\u03a3\n(U \u2297 V, W ) \u223c\n(U, V \u22b8 W )\n= CX,\u03a3\ndescend along the quotient map, and so induce a closed structure on CX,\u03a3 .\nFinally, since each piece of structure on CX,\u03a3 is obtained from the corresponding\n\u2032\n\u2032\npiece of structure on CX,\u03a3\n, the quotient map q : CX,\u03a3\n\u2192 CX,\u03a3 is strict symmetric\npremonoidal as required.\n\nObserve that the composite functor qi : CX \u2192 CX,\u03a3 , is a strict symmetric premonoidal closed functor between two symmetric monoidal closed categories; and\nas such, is actually a strict symmetric monoidal closed functor. We make use of\nthis fact below.\nTheorem 1. CX,\u03a3 is the classifying category of the syntactic theory with signature (X, \u03a3) and no equations.\nProof. Suppose first given a strict smc functor F : CX,\u03a3 \u2192 D; we obtain an\ninterpretation G : (X, \u03a3) \u2192 D by taking\nGX (x) = F (x)\n\nand Ga,b (\u03b1) = F [\u03b1] : F a \u2192 F b,\n\n(3)\n\u0001\nwhere, for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3(a, b), the morphism [\u03b1] : a \u2192 b of CX,\u03a3 is given by q (\u03b1), \u01ebab .\nConversely, we must show that each interpretation G : (X, \u03a3) \u2192 D lifts to a\nunique strict smc functor F : CX,\u03a3 \u2192 D satisfying (3). The action of G on\nground types is given by a function GX : X \u2192 ob D; and this is equally well a\nfunctor GX : X \u2192 D-with X regarded now as a discrete category-which, as\nCX is the free smc category on X, lifts to a strict smc functor G\u0303X : CX \u2192 D.\nIt follows that F , if it exists, must makes the following diagram of strict smc\nfunctors commute:\nqi\n\nCX\n\n\u2732\n\nCX,\u03a3\nF\nG\u0303X\n\n\u2732\n\u2732 C.\n\n(4)\n\nIndeed, to ask that the first equation in (3) should hold is equally well to ask\nthat (4) should commute when precomposed with the functor \u03b7 : X \u2192 CX exhibiting CX as free on X; and by the uniqueness part of the universal property of\n\n\fCX , this is equally well to ask (4) itself to commute. This determines the action\nof F on the objects and certain of the morphisms of CX,\u03a3 ; let us now extend\nthis to deal with an arbitrary morphism f : U \u2192 V . If f is represented by some\n\u2032\n(\u0393, \u03c6) in CX,\u03a3\n, then we may factorise it as\n\u2732 ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U\n\nq(\u0393,id)\n\nU\n\n\u2732 V\n\nq(i(\u03c6))\n\nin CX,\u03a3 ; and commutativity in (4) forces F , if it exists, to send the second part of\nthis factorisation to G\u0303X (\u03c6). For the first part, either we have \u0393 empty, in which\ncase q(\u0393, id) is the unit isomorphism U \u223c\n= I \u2297 U ; or we have \u0393 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ),\nin which case q(\u0393, id) decomposes as\nU\n\n\u223c\n=\u2732\n\n(\n\nO\n\nI )\u2297U\n\nN\n\ni\n\n[\u03b1i ] \u2297 U\n\n\u2732 ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U ,\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nwhere [\u03b1i ] : I \u2192 ty(\u03b1i ) is the exponential transpose of [\u03b1i ] : s(\u03b1i ) \u2192 t(\u03b1i ) in\nCX,\u03a3 . But since we require F , if it exists, to both satisfy the second equation in (3) and strictly preserve the smc structure, this determines its value on\nq(\u0393, id); and hence on an arbitrary morphism of CX,\u03a3 . Consequently, there is\nat most one strict smc functor F : CX,\u03a3 \u2192 C satisfying the equations in (3);\nand in order to conclude that there is exactly one such, we must check that the\nassignations described above underlie a well-defined strict smc functor F . This\nfollows by straightforward calculation: as a representative sample of which, we\nverify that F as given above is well-defined on morphisms. So let there be given\nf : U \u2192 V in CX,\u03a3 , together with two morphisms (\u03c3\u0393, \u03c6) and (\u0393, \u03c6 \u25e6 (\u03c3\u0302 \u2297 U ))\n\u2032\nof CX,\u03a3\nwhich represent it. Then we have the following commutative diagram in\nCX,\u03a3 :\nty(\u0393 ) \u2297 U qi(\u03c6\u25e6(\u03c3\u0302\u2297U))\nq(\u0393,id) \u2732\n\u2732\nqi(\u03c3\u0302\u2297U)\nU\n\u2732V\n\u2732\n\u2744\nqi(\u03c6)\nq(\u03c3\u0393,id)\nty(\u03c3\u0393 ) \u2297 U\nand must show that the corresponding diagram commutes when we apply F .\nThis is clear for the right-hand triangle; whilst for the left-hand one, it amounts\nto checking the following equality in D:\n\u223c\n=\n\nFU\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\nN\n\ni\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\nN\n\n[\u03b1i ] \u2297 F U\n\n\u2744\nF (ty(\u0393 )) \u2297 F U\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2732\nO\n(\nI ) \u2297 FU\n\n\u271b\nO\n(\nI ) \u2297 FU\n\nF \u03c3\u0302 \u2297 F U\n\ni\n\n[\u03b1\u03c3i ] \u2297 F U\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 F (ty(\u03c3\u0393 )) \u2297 F U ,\n\n\fwhich follows immediately from the symmetric monoidal closed category axioms.\nThe remaining calculations proceed similarly.\nFinally in this section, we consider the case of a general theory T = (X, \u03a3, E).\nLet CT be the quotient of CX,\u03a3 by the smallest congruence \u223c which contains all\nthe equations in E and respects the smc structure. We have:\nTheorem 2. CT is the classifying category of the theory T.\nIn fact, using a linear analogue of Lambek and Scott's [1988] functional completeness, we may give a more direct characterisation of the congruence \u223c. Here\nwe write pf q : I \u2192 a \u22b8 b to denote the currying of any map f : a \u2192 b.\nProperty 4. We obtain \u223c as the smallest equivalence relation generated by \u223c1 ,\nwhere f \u223c1 g : a \u2192 b just when there exists an equation u = v : c \u2192 d in E and\nmap h such that f is\na\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2732 I \u2297a\n\n\u2732 (c \u22b8 d) \u2297 a\n\npuq\u2297a\n\nh\n\n\u2732 b\n\nand replacing u with v yields g.\n\n3\n\nA graphical representation of the classifying category\n\nPutting Theorem 1 together with Hughes [2005]'s graphical description of CX ,\nwe obtain the following graphical representation of the category CX,\u03a3 . First, for\neach type a \u2208 X, we define the ports of a to be the set of leaf occurrences in\nit, which may either be of type I, or of ground types x \u2208 X. Ports are signed\npositive when they are reached by passing to the left of an even number of\n\u22b8, and negative otherwise. We let a+ and a\u2212 denote the sets of positive and\nnegative ports of a, respectively. We define a support to be a finite set labelled\nby elements of \u03a3. The ports of a support C are defined by\n`\n`\nC + = c\u2208C (ty(\u03b1c ))+\nand\nC \u2212 = c\u2208C (ty(\u03b1c ))\u2212 ,\n0\nwhere \u03b1c is the label of c. We now define the category DX,\u03a3\nof (X, \u03a3)-prenets\nto have:\n\n\u2013 Objects being elements of X.\n\u2013 Morphisms a \u2192 b being given by a support C together with a directed\ngraph G, whose vertices are the disjoint union of the ports of a, b and C;\nand whose edges are such that the incidence relation is the graph of a partial\nfunction\ng : a+ + C + + b \u2212 \u21c0 a\u2212 + C \u2212 + b + ,\n(5)\nthat restricts to a bijection of x-labeled ports for each x \u2208 X. We consider\nmorphisms equivalent up to the choice of support (replacing C with isomorphic C \u2032 , preserving g).\n\u2013 Identity maps a \u2192 a being given by the empty support together with the\nidentity graph.\n\n\f\u2013 Composition of maps (C, G) : a \u2192 b and (D, H) : b \u2192 c being given by the\nmap (C + D, G +b H) : a \u2192 c, where G +b H is obtained by glueing the\ngraphs G and H together along the ports of b. More formally, if x \u2208 G and\nz \u2208 H, then G +b H will have an edge x \u2192 z whenever there exist ports\ny1 , . . . , yk of b and edges\nx\n\n// y1\n\ny2\n\n// y3\n\nand\n\ny1\n\n// y2\n\ny3\n//\n\n...\n\nyk\u22121\n\n// yk\n\n...\n\n// yk\u22121\n\nyk\n\nin G\n// z\n\nin H.\n\nThere are three analogous cases when:\n\u2022 x \u2208 H and z \u2208 G,\n\u2022 x, z \u2208 H, or\n\u2022 x, z \u2208 G.\n1\nWe now consider the subcategory DX,\u03a3\nof (X, \u03a3)-nets with the same objects,\nbut whose morphisms are correct prenets in the following sense. First, for any\nimll formula a, let a\u2032 be its representation in classical MLL, i.e., using \u2297, ,\nI, \u22a5, and signed ground types x and x\u22a5 ; in particular, (a \u22b8 b)\u2032 = a\u2032\u22a5 b\u2032 .\nNow by a switching of a\u2032 , we mean a graph obtained by cutting exactly one\npremise of each node in the abstract syntax tree of a\u2032 ; and by a switching of\na (X, \u03a3)-prenet (C, G) : a \u2192 b, we mean a graph obtained by gluing along the\nports:\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nA switching of a\u2032\u22a5 ;\nA switching of b\u2032 ;\nA switching of each \u03b1\u2032\u22a5\nc (where \u03b1c is the label of c \u2208 C); and\nThe graph G (forgetting the orientation).\n\nThe prenet (C, G) is said to be correct, or a net, just when all its switchings are\ntrees. The nets a \u2192 b are in close correspondence with the morphisms a \u2192 b\nin the free smc category CX,\u03a3 . To see this, suppose given a net (C, G) : a \u2192 b\nwhose support\nIf we define \u0393 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) then we\n` is a finite set {1, . . . , n}.\nhave C + = 1\u2264i\u2264n (ty(\u03b1i ))+ \u223c\n= (ty(\u0393 ))\u2212 ; and we claim that\n= (ty(\u0393 ))+ and C \u2212 \u223c\nthe composite partial function\n\u223c\n\n=\n(ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 a)+ + b\u2212 \u2732 a+ + C + + b\u2212\n\ng\u2032\n\ng\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u223c\n=\n(ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 a)\u2212 + b+ \u271b a\u2212 + C \u2212 + b+ .\ndescribes a morphism ty(\u0393 ) \u2297 a \u2192 b in Hughes [2005]'s presentation of the free\nsmc category CX over X. For this, we just have to show correctness; but any\nswitching of (ty(\u0393 )\u2297a)\u22a5 amounts to a disjoint union of a switching of each of a\u22a5\nand the ty(\u03b1i )\u22a5 's, so that correctness follows from that of g. Thus (C, G) yields\na morphism a \u2192 b in CX,\u03a3 ; and conversely, given \u0393 , any correct representative\n\n\fg \u2032 in the sense of Hughes defines a correct net in our sense, with reordering of\n\u0393 resulting in an isomorphism of supports.\nFinally, we may mimic Trimble rewiring in our setting: say that f \u223c g when\ng is obtained by changing the target of a single edge from a negative occurrence\nof I in f , preserving correctness. This extends to an equivalence relation which\n1\nwe call rewiring. Letting DX,\u03a3 be the quotient of DX,\u03a3\nmodulo rewiring, we\nobtain:\nTheorem 3. The categories DX,\u03a3 and CX,\u03a3 are isomorphic in SMCCat.\nThe category DX,\u03a3 provides a graphical representation of the free smc category generated by (X, \u03a3). If X = {x, y} and \u03a3 is described by the following\ngraph:\nx\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2732 x\u2297y\n\ny \u2297 (x \u22b8 y)\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2732 y\n\nthen an example morphism from x \u2297 ((x \u2297 I) \u22b8 y) to I \u22b8 (x \u2297 y) of DX,\u03a3 is:\nx\n\u2297\n((\n\nx\n\u2297\ny\n\nI\ny\n\u2297\nx\ny\n\n\u22b8 (\n\n)\u22b8\n\n\u03b2\n\ny\n\nx\n\u2297\ny\n)\n\ny\n\n\u03b1\n\n( \u22b8 )\n\nx\n\u2297\nI\n\nx\n\n)\n\nNotice that the dotted link can be rewired to any positive port.\n\n\fBibliography\n\nR.
