The crossover between the regimes I and II occurs at T \u221d\u03be \u22123 (T ) where \u03be\nis the magnetic correlation length [3]. In the pure limit, in\nthe quantum-critical regime, the pole in the fluctuation\nspectra \u03c7(q, \u03c9) has a dispersion \u03c9\u223cq 3 , so that the dynamical critical exponent zd =3. Correspondingly, \u03be(T )\u223c\nT \u22122/3 in the region I. In the region II, \u03be\u223cr\u22121/2 at low T .\nThe problem of magnetic impurities was looked at long\nago by Larkin and Mel'nikov [12]. We have obtained\nsome new results. In the regime I, the net result of enhanced dynamical spin fluctuations at low energies and\nof a decreased high frequency cutoff is to enhance the\nKondo temperature. In the regime II, this enhancement\ndecreases rapidly and an ordinary S=1/2 magnetic impurity necessarily scatters in many angular momentum\nchannels because of the increasing magnetic correlation\nlength with the number of channels diverging as r\u21920.\nThe crossover from the multichannel to the single-channel behavior occurs at unattainably low temperatures.\nWe consider the model of S=1/2 magnetic impurities\ncoupling to the host electrons by the Hamiltonian\nX\nJ\n\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 * Sc\u2020k\u2032 \u03b1 ck\u03b2 .\n(1)\n2N\n\u2032\n\nThe asymptotic low temperature singularities in the\nthermodynamic and transport properties of many solids\nappear to be due to impurities [1]. While several impurity\nmodels have quantum-critical points (QCP), where such\nsingularities may be expected, they require special symmetries unlikely to be present in real systems [2]. An alternate possibility is that the pure system is near a QCP,\nso that singular low energy fluctuations are present [3\u20135].\nWe investigate the possibility in this paper that such fluctuations drive the effects of a dilute concentration of ordinary impurities (not requiring any special symmetries)\nso that the resulting observable properties are much more\nsingular than those near pure QCP [6,7].\nFor coupling to non-magnetic impurities, a general\nargument on the renormalized impurity scattering was\ngiven in relation to insulating behavior in marginal Fermi\nliquids [8]. It was recently proposed that critical fluctuations enhance potential scattering from non-magnetic\nimpurities so that the residual resistivity increases as the\nQCP is approached [9].\nHere we investigate the effects of magnetic impurities\nnear a ferromagnetic QCP. The problem is especially interesting for a number of reasons. First, it couples the\nquantum fluctuation or Kondo effect of magnetic impurities to the singular quantum fluctuations of the pure\nsystem. Second, since the transition is at q = 0 and the\norder parameter is conserved, conservation laws or Ward\nidentities can be used to obtain systematic results for the\neffect of impurities just as they are available for the pure\nferromagnetic QCP. Third, experimental results on extraordinary pure samples of a ferromagnet-MnSi [10,11],\nwhich has a QCP as a function of pressure, are in good\naccord with the theory [4]. A few results on less pure\nMnSi are available [11], which show interesting deviations from that of the purer samples near the QCP. We\nhope our results will serve as an impetus to further experimental results.\n\nk,k ,\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nWe assume that the dynamical spin susceptibility of the\npure system is given by\n\u03c7(q, \u03c9) = \u03c70 \u03ba20 [\u03ba2 + q 2 \u2212 i\u03c9/\u0393 q]\u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c70 is the magnetic susceptibility of the noninteracting system, \u03ba0 is of the order of the Fermi wave number pF , and \u03ba\u2261\u03ba(T ) is the inverse of \u03be(T ) [4]. Hereafter,\nr is defined by r\u2261\u03ba2 (T =0)/4p2F.\nFor coupling to magnetic impurities, the vertex renor(\u03c3)\nmalization \u039b(\u03c3) (p, \u031f)/\u039b0 is given by a formally exact\nexpression in terms of the irreducible part \u039b\u0304(\u03c3) (p, \u031f):\n1\n\n\f\u039b\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n(p, \u031f)\n(\u03c3)\n\n\u039b0\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c7(\u031f) \u039b\u0304(\u03c3) (p, \u031f)\n= 1+\u03b1\n,\n(\u03c3)\n\u03c70\n\u039b\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n\u0393l (\u03c9) \u2243\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n/\u039b0\n\n= [z (m\u2217 /m) (\u03b1 + \u03c70 /\u03c7)]\u22121 \u2243 1,\n\n(4)\n\ni.e., z(m\u2217 /m)\u2243\u03b1\u22121 \u223c1 when \u03c70 /\u03c7\u226a1. By general considerations, m/m\u2217 =z(1+\u2202\u03a3/\u2202\u01ebp). So \u2202\u03a3/\u2202\u01ebp is not singular while z \u22121 =1+\u2202\u03a3/\u2202\u03b5\u223c| ln(|\u03b5|, T )|. Another consequence of Eq.(4) is that the imaginary part of the oneinteraction irreducible part of \u03c7(\u031f) is given by\nIm\u03c7\u0304(\u031f) \u2243\n\n\u03c0X\n[f (\u03b5k\u2032 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5k )] \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5k\u2032 + \u03b5k )z 2 , (5)\n2\nk\n\nwhere k\u2032 =k+q, \u03b5k is the energy of the quasi-particles.\nThe interaction vertex between the host electrons and\nthe pseudofermion field has the form \u0393=\u0393(0) +\u0393(\u03c3) \u03c3*S.\nTo the leading order in J, the vertex is renormalized as\n\u0393\n\n(\u03c3)\n\nJ \u039b(\u03c3) (p, \u031f)\n,\n(p, \u03c91 ; p + \u031f, \u03c92 ) =\n(\u03c3)\n2N\n\u039b0\n\nX\nJ2\n\u03b4Z(\u03c9) = \u2212 2 S(S + 1)\nN\nq\n\n(6)\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\nIm\u03c7(\u031f) =\n\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032 Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9 \u2032 )\n.

Using Eqs.(3) and (4), \u0393(\u03c3) is proportional to \u03c7(\u031f) in the q limit. In the three-dimensional\nsystem with a spherical Fermi surface, it is useful to consider partial-wave components of \u0393(\u03c3) :\n\u0393(\u03c3) (p, \u03b5, \u03c91 ; p + q, \u03b5 + \u03c9, \u03c92 ) =\n\n(10)\n\nP\nwhere Dl \u2261\u0393 (2pF exp(\u2212 ln=1 n\u22121 ))3 serves as an upper\ncutoff of |\u03c9|, \u0393 \u03ba3 or \u0393 |p \u2212 p\u2032 |3 for each l. For the Kondo\nproblem we will investigate bellow, the on-shell scattering \u03b5p\u2032 =\u03b5p +\u03c9 is important so that |\u03c9|>\u0393 |p\u2212p\u2032 |3 . Hence,\nwe put p=p\u2032 =pF .\nIf |\u03c9| is regarded as \u223cT , Eq.(10) leads us to the follow(\u03c3)\ning facts: in the regime II, the \u03c9-dependence of \u0393l is\nnegligible and the number of effective angular momentum\nchannels increases as lmax \u223c2pF \u03be because the effective size\nof the impurity scales up as \u03be [12]; in the regime I, the\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n\u03c9-dependence of \u0393l is singular as \u0393l \u221dln(Dl /|\u03c9|) because the effective exchange interaction acts over the long\nrange not only in space but also in time.\nIn order to demonstrate carefully how the singular \u03c9dependence is combined with perturbative renormalization group (RG) equations for the Kondo problem near\nthe QCP, first we consider the renormalization factor of\nthe pseudofermion propagator Z(\u03c9). The leading order\ncorrection, \u03b4Z(\u03c9), with respect to J is given by\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the coupling constant between the host electrons, \u03b1=2U \u03c70 for the Hubbard interaction. We have\nused the simplified notation, p=(p, \u03b5) and \u031f=(q, \u03c9).\nFor fluctuations in which \u03c9\u223cq 3 , a version of Migdal\ntheorem holds in the so-called q limit, \u03c9\u21920, q\u21920 with\n\u03c9/vq = 0 so that the Ward-identity requires [13]\n\u039b\u0304\n\nJ\u03b1 \u03ba20\nDl\nln\n,\n6N p2F max[|\u03c9|, \u0393 \u03ba3 , \u0393 |p \u2212 p\u2032 |3 ]\n\n\u223c S(S + 1)\n\n(8)\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n2l + 1\nl=0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n(\u03c3)\n\nD\n\nd\u03b5\n\n|z\u0393l (\u03b5)|2 m\u22172 2\n\u033a ,\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5 m2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u033a=N mpF /2\u03c0 2 .\nFrom Eq.(13), the variation of Z(\u03c91 ) on reducing the\nbandwidth cutoff from D to D\u2212\u03b4D is obtained immedi(\u03c3)\nately. For \u0393l (\u03b5p , \u03c91 ; \u03b5p\u2032 , \u03c92 ), the O(J 2 ) term is\n\nwhere q2 =(p\u2212p\u2032 )2 =p2 +p\u20322 \u22122pp\u2032 cos \u03b8, Pl are Legendre\n(\u03c3)\nfunctions of the first kind. The real part of \u0393l (\u03c9)\u2261\n(\u03c3)\n\u0393l (\u03b5, \u03c91 ; \u03b5+\u03c9, \u03c92 ) has a singular contribution, while\n(\u03c3)\nthe imaginary part of \u0393l (\u03c9) vanishes when \u03c9\u21920. By\nuse of three roots, x1 ,x2 and x3 , of a cubic equation,\nx3 \u22122x2 +x\u2212(\u03c9/\u0393 \u03ba3 )2 =0, we obtain\n\u0014\nx1 (1 \u2212 x1 )\nJ \u03b1\u03ba20\n(\u03c3)\nRe\u0393l (\u03c9) =\nQl (\u03b61 )\n\u2032\n2N pp (x3 \u2212 x1 )(x1 \u2212 x2 )\n\u0015\n+ 2 cyclic permutations ,\n(9)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0014\nz m\u2217\n\u03b4D\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n\u033a \u0393l (D \u2212 \u03b5p )\u0393l (\u03b5p\u2032 \u2212 D)\n2m\n\u03c91 \u2212 D + \u03b5p\n\u0015\n\u03b4D\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n.

In Eqs.(13) and (14), z and m\u2217 should be understood as functions of the energy scale D, respectively.\nThe high-energy spectrum around the band edge of the\nhost electrons may be approximated to be that of the free\nelectrons so that z\u223c1 and m\u2217 \u223cm at an early stage of the\nRG procedure. Even at the low energy, where z vanishes\non a logarithmic scale, the product z(m\u2217 /m) remains of\n\nwhere \u03b6i =(p2 +p\u20322 +\u03ba2 xi )/2pp\u2032 for i=1,2,3 and Ql are\nLegendre functions of the second kind. Noting that Ql (\u03b6)\nhave branch points at \u03b6=\u00b11, we can evaluate the singular\n(\u03c3)\ncontribution in \u0393l as\n2\n\n\fthe order of 1 by virtue of Eq.(4). Therefore the renormalization of the wave function and of the mass of the\nhost electron does not affect the resulting scaling equation. Neglecting \u03b5p /D, \u03b5p\u2032 /D and \u03c91 /D compared to\n1 while keeping the explicit dependence on \u03c9=\u03b5p\u2032 \u2212\u03b5p ,\nwe obtain the 2-loop scaling equation for the invariant\ncoupling \u03bbl (\u03c9) as\n\nOn the basis of the two-loop expansion, the quasi\u22121\n(r, T )=zIm\u03a3imp (r, T ) and\nparticle's damping rate \u03c4imp\nthe electrical resistivity \u03c1imp (r, T ) due to magnetic impurities can be expressed in terms of \u03bbl (\u03c9) as follows:\n\u221e\n\n\u22121\n\u03c4imp\n=\n\n\u221e\n\nX 2l\u2032 + 1\nd\u03bbl (\u03c9)\n= \u2212 |\u03bbl (D)|2 + \u03bbl (\u03c9)\n|\u03bbl\u2032 (D)|2 . (15)\nd ln D\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1imp =\n\nl =0\n\nUsing Eq.(10), the initial bandwidth cutoff in Eq.(15)\ncan be put as D0 =\u0393 (2pF )3 ; the bare coupling constant, i.e., the value of \u03bbl (\u03c9) at D=D0 , is given by\n(b)\n(\u03c3)\n\u03bbl (\u03c9)=(\u033a/\u03b1)\u0393l (\u03c9) and the scaling stops at D=T .\n(b)\nThe solution of Eq.(15) has the form, \u03bbl (\u03c9)=\u03bbl (\u03c9)A\n+(J\u033a/N )Bl , where A and Bl are functions of D which\nare independent of \u03c9.

The RG flow of\nA and Bl describes correlation not only between angular momentum channels but also between long-time and\ninstantaneous components of the effective interaction.\nIf we consider the scaling equation at the one-loop level\nwhere the third-order term of Eq.(15) is neglected, we can\nmake a rough estimation of the Kondo temperature TK ,\nwhich is associated with the breakdown of the perturba(b)\ntion theory, near the QCP. By use of Eq.(10) for \u03bbl (\u03c9),\nthe one-loop scaling equation can be solved analytically.\nThe result depends on whether \u0393 \u03ba3 (T ) is smaller than\nT or not in accordance with the region I or II as\nhp\ni\np\n\uf8f1\n \u0303 ln(T /\u0393 \u03ba3 ) + J \u0303 tan\n \u0303 ln(Dl /T )\n\uf8f4\nJ\nJ\nI\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\nhp\ni\n\uf8f2\n3\nJ \u0303 tan\nJ \u0303 ln(Dl /\u0393 \u03ba )\n,\n\u03bbl (0) =\n\uf8f4\nhp\ni\np\nII\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1 \u2212 J \u0303 tan\nJ \u0303 ln(Dl /\u0393 \u03ba3 ) ln(\u0393 \u03ba3 /T )\n\n \u0303\nwhere J=(J\u033a/6N\n)(\u03ba20 /p2F ). Since \u03bb0 (0)\u2265\u03bbl (0) for arbitrary l, we evaluate TK as temperature at which \u03bb0 (0)\ndiverges. Noting \u0393 \u03ba3 \u2243D0 r3/2 in the region II, we obtain\n\uf8f1\n\u0010 \u000e p \u0011\n\uf8f2\nexp\n\u2212\u03c0 2 J \u0303\nr < r\u2217\nTK\nhp\ni\u0011\n\u0010 \u000ep\n=\n,\n \u0303 ln r3/2 |\n\uf8f3 r3/2 exp \u22121\nD0\nJ \u0303 tan\nJ|\nr > r\u2217\n\u0010\np \u0011\nwhere r\u2217 \u2261exp \u2212\u03c0/3 J \u0303 . As a direct consequence of\nthe coupling between the quantum fluctuation of an individual magnetic impurity and dynamical spin fluctuations of host electrons, TK is seen to be enhanced in the\nregion around a ferromagnetic QCP.\n3\n\nX\n\u03c02\nS(S + 1)\n(l + 1)2 (\u03bb2l (0) \u2212 \u03bb2l+1 (0)),\n4\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c02\nS(S + 1)\n4\n\n(18)\n\nl=0\n\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\n(l + 1)(\u03bbl (0) \u2212 \u03bbl+1 (0))2 .\n\nBy solving Eq.(15) numerically by use of Eq.(9) for\n(b)\n\u22121\n\u03bbl (\u03c9), T -dependences of \u03c4imp\nand \u03c1imp are obtained in\n \u0303\nFig.2, for J =0.02 in the weak coupling regime and for several values of r. We also show the result of the Born ap\u22121\nproximation where \u03c4imp\n\u221d\u03be 2 (T ) and \u03c1imp \u221dln \u03be(T ), which\nvisualizes the crossover line from the regime I to the\nregime II. The fixed point is that of the single-channel\nKondo problem; the multichannel effects can be seen as\na transient phenomenon. Note that TK , at which \u03c1imp is\nof the order of 1, increases rapidly in the region II from\nr\u223c0.1 to \u223c0.01 while showing a tendency to be saturated\nin the region I, consistently with the one-loop result.\nIn the regime II far away from the QCP, the \u03c9(\u03c3)\ndependence of the vertex \u0393l is suppressed, so that\nthe low-energy effective Hamiltonian may be mapped\ninto the anisotropic n\u2248(lmax +1)2 -channel Kondo model\nwith the band-width cutoff D\u2248D0 r3/2 , in which the cou(b)\npling constant \u03bbl is given by \u03bbl (0). By general considerations of the anisotropic multichannel Kondo model,\nwhile one enters the influence of the multichannel fixed\npoint for T below O(TK ), channel anisotropy introduces\nanother energy scale Tx below which the stable singlechannel fixed point is reached [14]. Hence the crossover\nfrom the multichannel to the single-channel behavior\nis predicted when Tx /TK \u226a1. For the n-channel case,\nTK \u223cD\u03bb\u0304n/2 exp(\u22121/\u03bb\u0304) and Tx asymptotically scales as\n(\u2206\u03bb)1+n/2 , where \u03bb\u0304 and \u2206\u03bb are the average and difference of coupling constants, respectively [14]. For the\ntwo-channel case, a recent numerical RG study has shown\nthat Tx \u2243D(\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb\u0304)2 exp(\u22121/\u03bb\u0304) [15]. From these results,\nwe expect that Tx is given by D(\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb\u0304)1+n/2 exp(\u22121/\u03bb\u0304),\nso that Tx /TK can be evaluated as (\u2206\u03bb)1+n/2 /\u03bb\u03041+n .\nFor the present\neffective Hamiltonian, from Eq.(10),\n \u0303 ln \u221ar| while \u03bbl \u2212\u03bbl+1 \u22433J/(l+1).\n \u0303\n\u03bbl \u22433J|\nSince lmax \u2248\n\u22121/2\nr\n, we may make a rough estimation of Tx /TK as\n\u0010p\n\u221a \u0011\u22121/r\n\u221a\nTx\n \u0303 ln r|\n \u0303 \u2212n/2 | ln r|\u2212n\u22121 \u2248\n3J|\n.

Then for the region of interest away from the QCP in the region II, at experimentally attainable temperatures the observable properties\n\n\fare expected to be those for a line of critical points with\nsingular properties with exponents continuously changing as r changes.\nThe true fixed point at r\u22650 would be the fixed point\nof the single-channel Kondo problem. It has zero ground\nstate entropy. For finite r and T \u226bTx in the intermediate\ncoupling regime, we may read off the results for the entropy and its leading temperature dependence from the\nexact solution for the multichannel problem [16].\nOn the experimental side, systematic results for the\nresistivity as a function of r are not available. Further\nwork is required to test the predictions made above.\nAuthors would like to acknowledge H. Kohno, O.\nNarikiyo, T. Senthil and Qimiao Si for clarifying discussions. They also thank I.
