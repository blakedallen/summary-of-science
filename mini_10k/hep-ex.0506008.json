The data are collected with a fully active scintillator\ndetector in the K2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. No evidence for coherent pion\nproduction is observed and an upper limit of 0.60 \u00d7 10\u22122 is set on the cross section ratio of coherent\npion production to the total charged-current interaction at 90% confidence level. This is the first\nexperimental limit for coherent charged pion production in the energy region of a few GeV.\nPACS numbers: 13.15.+g,25.30.Pt,95.55.Vj\n\nThe charged-current (CC) coherent pion production in\nneutrino-nucleus scattering, \u03bd\u03bc + A \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + \u03c0 + + A, is\na process in which the neutrino scatters coherently off\nthe entire nucleus with a small energy transfer. Such\na process has been measured in a number of experiments [1, 2, 3, 4], providing a test of the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis [5]. The\nexisting data agree with the Rein and Sehgal model [6]\nbased on the PCAC hypothesis for neutrino energies from\n7 to 100 GeV, while there exists no measurement at lower\nenergies.\nThe recent discovery of neutrino oscillations has renewed interest in neutrino-nucleus interactions in the\nsub- to few GeV region. The KEK to Kamioka (K2K)\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment has reported [7] a significant deficit in the forward scattering events, which limits the prediction accuracy of the\nneutrino energy spectrum at the far detector. CC coherent pion production is one of the candidate interactions responsible for this deficit and its study is necessary to improve the accuracy of the current and future atmospheric/accelerator-based neutrino oscillation\nexperiments, which are expected to achieve much improved statistical precision using interactions of neutrinos\nin the same energy region as K2K.\nThis letter presents the result from a search for CC\ncoherent pion production by neutrinos in the K2K experiment. We compare our result specifically with the\nRein and Sehgal model [6] because it is the only model\nthat provides the kinematics of pions and is commonly\nused in neutrino oscillation experiments.\nIn the K2K experiment, protons are extracted from the\nKEK 12 GeV proton synchrotron and hit an aluminum\ntarget. Positively charged secondary particles, mainly pions, are focused by a magnetic horn system and decay\nto produce an almost pure (98%) \u03bd\u03bc beam with a mean\nenergy of 1.3 GeV [8]. The neutrino beam energy spectrum and spatial profile are measured using a set of near\nneutrino detectors located 300 m downstream from the\nproton target. The estimated absolute flux has a large\nuncertainty due to difficulties in the absolute estimation\nof the primary proton beam intensity, the proton targeting efficiency, and hadron production cross sections.\nTherefore, the ratio of the CC coherent pion to the total\nCC cross section is measured, rather than the absolute\n\nCC coherent pion cross section. The data used for this\nanalysis were collected with one of the near detectors,\nthe fully active scintillator detector (SciBar), from October 2003 to February 2004, corresponding to 1.7 \u00d7 1019\nprotons on target (POT).\nThe SciBar detector [9] consists of 14,848 extruded\nplastic scintillator strips read out by wavelength-shifting\nfibers and multi-anode photomultipliers. The scintillator also acts as the neutrino interaction target; it is\na fully active detector and has high efficiency for low\nmomentum particles. Scintillator strips with dimensions of 1.3 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 300 cm3 are arranged in 64 layers. Each layer consists of two planes to measure horizontal and vertical position. The total size of the detector is 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 1.7 m3 , while an inner volume of\n2.6 \u00d7 2.6 \u00d7 1.35 m3 (9.38 tons) is used as the fiducial\nvolume to reject incoming particles and obtain a flat efficiency for CC interactions. The minimum reconstructible\ntrack length is 8 cm. A track finding efficiency of more\nthan 99% is achieved for single tracks with a length of\nmore than 10 cm. The track finding efficiency for a second, shorter track is lower than that for single tracks due\nto overlap with the first track. This efficiency increases\nwith the length of the second track and reaches 90% at\na track length of 30 cm.\nThe NEUT Monte Carlo (MC) simulation program library [10] is used to simulate neutrino-nucleus interactions. The CC coherent pion production is incorporated\nin the simulation based on the Rein and Sehgal model [6],\nwhich predicts the cross section averaged over the K2K\nneutrino energy spectrum of 2.85\u00d710\u221240cm2 /nucleon for\ncarbon. The Llewellyn Smith model [11] and the Rein\nand Sehgal model [12] are employed for quasi-elastic (QE)\nscattering (\u03bd\u03bc + n \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + p) and CC single pion (1\u03c0)\nproduction (\u03bd\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bc + N + \u03c0), where N is a nucleon, respectively. The axial vector mass of the nu2\ncleon form factor is set to be 1.1 GeV/c for both QE\nand CC1\u03c0 interactions [13]. For deep inelastic scattering (DIS), we use GRV94 nucleon structure functions [14]\nwith a correction by Bodek and Yang [15]. Nuclear effects\nare taken into account; for the pions originating from\nneutrino interactions, absorption, elastic scattering, and\ncharge exchange inside the target nucleus are simulated.\nPion cross sections are calculated using the model by Salcedo et al. [16], which agrees well with past experimental\n\n\fFor the present analysis, the experimental signatures\nof CC coherent pion production are the existence of exactly two tracks, both consistent with minimum ionizing particles, and small momentum transfer defined as\nq 2 \u2261 (P\u03bc \u2212 P\u03bd )2 , where P\u03bc and P\u03bd are the four momenta\nof the muon and the neutrino, respectively. According\nto the MC simulation, the dominant background is the\nCC1\u03c0 production, where the proton is below threshold\nor the neutron is invisible.\nCharged current (CC) candidate events are selected by\nrequiring that at least one reconstructed track starting\nin the fiducial volume is matched with a track or hits in\nthe muon range detector (MRD) [19] located just behind\nSciBar (SciBar-MRD sample). This criterion imposes a\nthreshold for muon momentum (p\u03bc ) of 450 MeV/c. According to the MC simulation, 98% of the events selected\nby this requirement are CC induced events, and the rest\nare neutral current (NC) interactions accompanied by a\ncharged pion or proton which penetrates into the MRD.\nThe contribution from \u03bde is negligible (< 0.4%). The\nmomentum of the muon is reconstructed from its range\nthrough SciBar and MRD. The resolutions for p\u03bc and the\nangle with respect to the neutrino beam direction (\u03b8\u03bc ) are\ndetermined to be 80 MeV/c and 1.6 degrees, respectively.\nFrom the SciBar-MRD sample, events with two reconstructed tracks are selected. The QE candidate events\nare rejected by using kinematic information [7]. Events\nin which the shorter track is identified as proton-like\nbased on dE/dx information (non-QE-proton sample) are\nalso rejected to select the non-QE-pion sample, which\nincludes the signal candidates. The particle identification capability is verified using cosmic ray muons and\nthe shorter tracks in the QE sample, where the latter\nprovides a proton sample with more than 90%. The probability to mis-identify a muon track as proton-like is 1.7%\nwith a corresponding proton selection efficiency of 90%.\nThe CC coherent pion candidates are extracted from\nthe non-QE-pion sample. The background events are\nsuppressed by requiring that the pion-like track goes forward. Even if the additional particles in the background\nprocess are not reconstructed as tracks, they can be detected as a large energy deposit or additional hits around\nthe vertex. Figure 1(a) shows a distribution of energy\ndeposited in the vertex strip (Evtx ) for the non-QE-pion\nsample. The MC prediction for Evtx is verified with the\nQE sample, which has no contribution from non-visible\nparticles, as shown in Fig. 1(b). We require the events to\nhave Evtx less than 7 MeV and no additional hits around\nthe vertex strip.\nThe value of q 2 reconstructed from p\u03bc and \u03b8\u03bc under\n2\nthe assumption of QE interaction is denoted qrec\n, and is\n\n(a)\n\n120\n\nData\nCC coherent \u03c0\nCC 1\u03c0, DIS, NC\nCC QE\n\n80\n40\n0\n\n0\n\nEntries / MeV\n\ndata [17].

Events are required\n2\nto have a reconstructed q 2 of less than 0.10 (GeV/c) .\nThe background contamination in the final sample is\nestimated by the MC simulation. In order to constrain\n2\nthe uncertainties, the qrec\ndistributions of the data in the\n2\n2\nregion qrec > 0.10(GeV/c) are fitted with MC expectations. The one track sample is used as well as two-track\nQE, non-QE-proton and non-QE-pion samples, and these\nfour samples are fitted simultaneously. In the fit, the\nnon-QE to QE relative cross section ratio, the magnitude of the nuclear effects and the momentum scale for\nmuons are treated as free parameters. Figure 2 shows\n2\nthe qrec\ndistributions of the data with the MC simulation after the fitting. The \u03c72 value in the regions with\n2\n2\nqrec\n> 0.10(GeV/c) at the best fit is 73.2 for 82 degrees\nof freedom (DOF).\n2\nFigure 3 shows the qrec\ndistribution for the final CC\ncoherent pion sample. The number of events in each selection step is summarized in Table I together with the\nsignal efficiency and purity. In the signal region, 113\ncoherent pion candidates are found. The neutrino energy spectra for coherent pion events and the efficiency\nas a function of neutrino energy, estimated using the MC\nsimulation, are shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(c), respectively.\nThe total efficiency is 21.1%. The expected number of\nbackground events in the signal region is 111.4. After\nsubtracting the background and correcting for the efficiency, the number of coherent pion events is measured\nto be 7.64 \u00b1 50.40 (stat.), while 470 events are expected\nfrom the MC simulation.

As shown in Table I,\n10049 events fall into this category. Based on the MC\nsimulation, the selection efficiency and purity for CC interactions in the sample are estimated to be 56.9% and\n98.0%, respectively. The expected neutrino energy spectra and the energy dependence of the selection efficiency\nfor CC events are shown in Fig. 4(b) and 4(d), respectively. The total number of CC events is obtained to be\n(1.73 \u00b1 0.02(stat.)) \u00d7 104 . We derive the cross section\nratio of CC coherent pion production to the total CC\ninteraction to be (0.04 \u00b1 0.29(stat.)) \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nSystematic uncertainties for the cross section ratio are\nsummarized in Table II. The major contributions come\nfrom uncertainties of nuclear effects and the neutrino interaction models. The uncertainty due to nuclear effects\nis estimated by varying the cross sections of pion absorption and elastic scattering by \u00b130% based on the\naccuracy of the reference data [17]. The uncertainties in\nQE and CC1\u03c0 interactions are estimated by changing the\n2\naxial vector mass by \u00b1 0.10 GeV/c [13].

All of them are estimated by the MC simulation.\n\ndistribution of the non-QE-proton sample (Fig. 2(c)) indicates an additional deficit of background events in the\n2\nregion qrec\n< 0.10 (GeV/c)2 . CC1\u03c0 interaction dominates events in this region; its cross section has significant uncertainty due to nuclear effects. We estimate\nthe amount of possible deficit in the same manner as described in [7] with the one track, QE and non-QE-proton\nsamples. We find that a 20% suppression of CC1\u03c0 events\n2\nfor qtrue\n< 0.10 (GeV/c)2 is allowed, which varies the\ncross section ratio by +0.14\u00d710\u22122. This variation is conservatively treated as a systematic uncertainty. We also\nconsider the uncertainties of the event selection, where\nthe dominant error comes from track counting, detector\nresponse such as scintillator quenching, and neutrino energy spectrum shape. The total systematic uncertainty\non the cross section ratio amounts to +0.32/\u22120.35\u00d710\u22122.\nOur result is consistent with the non-existence of CC\ncoherent pion production at K2K neutrino beam energies,\nand hence we set an upper limit on the cross section ratio\nat 90% C.L. :\n\u03c3(CC coherent \u03c0)/\u03c3(\u03bd\u03bc CC) < 0.60 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\n\n\f5\nError source\nUncertainty of \u03c3 ratio (\u00d710\u22122 )\nNuclear effects\n+0.23\n\u22120.24\nInteraction model\n+0.10\n\u22120.09\nCC1\u03c0 suppression\n+0.14\n-\nEvent selection\n+0.11\n\u22120.17\nDetector response\n+0.09\n\u22120.16\nEnergy spectrum\n+0.03\n\u22120.03\nTotal\n+0.32\n\u22120.35\nTABLE II: The summary of systematic uncertainties in the\n(CC coherent pion)/(total CC interaction) cross section ratio.\n\nFor reference, the total CC cross section is calculated as\n1.07 \u00d7 10\u221238 cm2 /nucleon in the neutrino MC simulation\nby averaging over K2K neutrino beam energies.\nThe obtained upper limit is inconsistent with the\nmodel prediction by Rein and Sehgal at the level of 2.5\nstandard deviations. We assign a 35 % uncertainty to the\ntheoretical prediction as described in [6]. In addition, a finite cross section was reported by Aachen-Padova group\nfor NC coherent pion production with 2 GeV average\nneutrino energy and with aluminum target [20]. If we\nassume an A1/3 dependence of the cross section (\u03c3) and\n\u03c3(CC) = 2\u03c3(NC) according to the model of Rein and\nSehgal, the discrepancy between the extrapolation from\nthe NC measurement and the present result is as large\nas 3 standard deviations. There are other models predicting lower cross sections [21, 22, 23], but they do not\nprovide the kinematics of pions and it is difficult to test\nthem directly. Further theoretical work is necessary to\nconstruct interaction models which explain these experimental results. The non-existence of CC coherent pion\nproduction has given a solution to the low-q 2 discrepancy\nobserved in K2K. It also reduces the uncertainty on the\ncross section in the relevant q 2 region, which is crucial\nfor the future neutrino oscillation experiments.\nIn summary, we report on a search for CC coherent\npion production by muon neutrinos with a mean energy\nof 1.3 GeV. The data analyzed correspond to 1.7 \u00d7 1019\nPOT recorded with the K2K-SciBar detector. No evidence of CC coherent pion production is found and an\nupper limit on the cross section ratio of CC coherent pion\nproduction to the total CC interaction is derived to be\n0.60\u00d710\u22122 at 90% C.L. This result is the first experimental limit for CC coherent pion production by neutrinos\nwith energies of a few GeV.\n\nWe thank the KEK and ICRR directorates for their\nstrong support and encouragement.
