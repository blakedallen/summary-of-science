INTRODUCTION\n\nMathematical models used in physics and mechanics\ndo not always possess a canonical Hamiltonian structure. Typically, the dynamics is governed by partial\ndifferential equations expressed in terms of physicallybased variables, which are not usually canonical. A\ntransformation to new variables is needed in order to\nunveil the desired structure explicitly. This is the case\nfor the equations of motion for an ideal fluid: in the\nEulerian description, they cannot be recast in a canonical form, whereas in a Lagrangian frame the Hamiltonian structure is revealed by Clebsch potentials. Moreover, multiple-scale perturbations of differential equations expressed in terms of non-canonical variables typically lead to approximate equations that do not maintain the fundamental conserved quantities, as the hydrostatic primitive equations on the sphere, where energy and angular momentum conservation are lost under the hydrostatic approximation. Clearly, if canonical\nvariables can be identified, then the associated Hamiltonian structure provides a natural framework for making\nconsistent approximations that preserve the fundamental dynamical properties of the original system, notably\nits conservation laws. For example, consider the equations that describe the irrotational flow of an ideal incompressible fluid of infinite depth with a free surface.\nTheir Hamiltonian description was discovered by [15] in\nterms of the free-surface elevation \u03b7(x, t) and the velocity potential \u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(x, z = \u03b7(x, t), t) evaluated\nat the free surface of the fluid. Variables \u03b7(x, t) and\n\u03c6(x, t) are conjugated canonical variables with respect\nto the Hamiltonian H given by the total wave energy.\nBy means of a third order expansion of H in the wave\nsteepness, [16] derived an integro-differential equation in\n1) e-mail:\n\n1\n1\n1\ni\n3\n2\nBt + Bx + iBxx \u2212 Bxxx + |B| B + |B|Bx\n2\n8\n16\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2 \u2217\n+ \u03b2B Bx + iBH(|B| )x = 0, (1)\n2\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/4, the subscripts Bt = \u2202t B and Bx = \u2202x B\ndenote partial derivatives with respect to x and t, respectively, H(f ) is the Hilber Transform of a function\nf (x), and B \u2217 denotes complex conjugation (see also [7]).\nThe form of the equation for the envelope A of the wave\npotential is similar to (1), but the term \u03b2B 2 Bx\u2217 becomes\n\u2212\u03b2A2 A\u2217x [6]. Recently, the associated canonical form\n(which do not contain the \u03b2 term) has been derived by\n[5] starting from the Hamiltonian Zakharov equation\nwith the Krasitskii kernel [9]. We also point out that\n[17], starting from a conformal-mapping formulation of\nthe Euler equations derived another version of the temporal Dysthe equation, which is similar to (1) but also\nnon-Hamiltonian.\nOn the other hand, to model wave propagation in\nwave basins a change to a coordinate system moving\nat the group velocity can be used by introducing the\ndimensionless variables\nB = \u03b5u,\n\nfedele@gatech.edu\n\n1\n\n\u03c4 = \u03b5(2x \u2212 t),\n\n\u03be = \u03b52 x,\n\n\f2\n\nF.

As such,\nthe temporal Dysthe equation (1) transforms, up to the\nfourth order in \u03b5, to\n2\n\nu\u03be +iu\u03c4 \u03c4 +i |u| u+8\u03b5 |u|\n\n2\n\nu\u03c4 +2\u03b5u2 u\u2217\u03c4 +2\u03b5iuH(|u|2 )\u03c4\n\n= 0,\n(2)\nhereafter referred to as the spatial Dysthe for the wave\nenvelope u.

In\nparticular, we introduce a gauge transformation that\nyields a canonical form of equation (2) for the wave\nenvelope u, and new invariants for it. As a corollary,\nwe will also show that equation (3) for the wave potential envelope v is already Hamiltonian. Then, the\nPetviashvili method is exploited to compute numerically ground states and traveling waves ([12]; see also\n[10, 14]). Their dynamics is numerically investigated\nup to machine precision by means of a highly accurate\npseudo spectral scheme in order to provide new insights\non the integrability of the Dysthe equations.\n\n2. CANONICAL FORM\n\nHereafter, we will consider the generic nonlinear\nequation\n2\n\n2\n\nu\u03be = \u2212iau\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 ih |u| u \u2212 c\u03b5 |u| u\u03c4\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b5eu2 u\u2217\u03c4 \u2212 f i\u03b5uH(|u| )\u03c4 , (4)\nwith (a, h, c, e, f ) as a quintuplet of arbitrary real coefficients. In particular, the spatial Dysthe for the wave\nand potential envelopes follow from (4) with parameters\n(1, 1, 8, 2, 2) and (1, 1, 8, 0, 2) respectively. The wave action\nZ\n2\nA = |u| d\u03c4\n(5)\n\nis conserved by (4), but up to date no other conservation\nlaws are known for u.\nDrawing from [3] (see also [13]), the invariance of\nA suggests the following variable change via the gauge\ntransformation\nw = G(u) = u exp(ik\u03c8),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k is a free parameter, and the 'stream function'\n\u03c8 is defined as \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8 = \u03c8\u03c4 = |u|2 . Note that |u|2 = |w|2\n\nw\u03be = \u2212iaw\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 ih |w| w \u2212 i\n\nwhich admits the Hamiltonian structure\n!\n!\n!\n\u03b4Hw\nw\u03be\n0 1\n\u03b4w\n,\n=i\n\u03b4Hw\n\u22121 0\nw\u03be\u2217\n\u03b4w \u2217\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian is given by\nZ \u0010\nh\nce \u2212 2e2 2\n2\n4\n6\na |w\u03c4 | \u2212 |w| \u2212\n\u03b5 |w|\nHw =\n2\n12a\n\u0011\nc\u2212e\nf\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212i\n\u03b5 |w| (w\u03c4\u2217 w \u2212 w\u03c4 w\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b5 |w| H(|w| )\u03c4 d\u03c4.\n4\n2\n(10)\nHere, Hw is also an invariant together with the momentum\nZ\nMw = i(w\u03c4\u2217 w \u2212 w\u03c4 w\u2217 )d\u03c4.\n(11)\n\nThus, from (6)\nZ \u0010\nce + e2 2 6\nh\n\u03b5 |u|\nE(u) =\na|u\u03c4 |2 \u2212 |u|4 +\n2\n6a\n\u0011\nf\nc+e\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b5 |u| (u\u2217\u03c4 u \u2212 u\u03c4 u\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b5 |u| H(|u| )\u03c4 d\u03c4,\n\u2212i\n4\n2\n(12)\nZ h\ni\ne\ni(u\u2217\u03c4 u \u2212 u\u03c4 u\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b5 |u|4 d\u03c4,\nM(u) =\na\nare both invariants of the spatial Dysthe equation (4),\nbut E is not the associated Hamiltonian. Note the appearance of terms of O(\u03b52 ) in the invariants E and Hw .\nThey both vanish if e is null; as a result u = w and\nE(u) = Hw becomes the Hamiltonian for u. As a consequence, the spatial Dysthe (1) for the wave envelope\nB is non Hamiltonian since e = 2, whereas the wave\npotential v is canonical (cf. eq. (3)).\nIn the next section we use a highly accurate Fouriertype pseudo-spectral method to solve for the envelope\ndynamics and validate the invariance of the Hamiltonian (10) of w and the new invariants (12) of u. In\nour numerical investigations, it is found that they are\nconserved up to machine precision.\n\n\f3\n\nHamiltonian form of the spatial Dysthe equations\n3. GROUND STATES AND TRAVELING WAVES\n\u03b5=0\n\n8\n\nAs an application, consider the non-Hamiltonian\nDysthe (2), particular case of (4) with parameters\n(1, 1, 8, 2, 2). Figure 1 shows the action A of the ground\nstate (s = 0) for u (and so w due to the gauge invariance\nof (6)) as function of \u03bc, computed for different values\nof the steepness \u03b5, and Figure 2 reports the associated\nenvelopes |u| = |w| for \u03bc = 3. As one can see, as \u03b5\nincreases they tend to reduce in size in agreement with\nthe asymptotic analysis carried out by [1] in the limit\nof \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nFurthermore, Figure 3 illustrates a typical basin\nof attraction of the Petviashvili scheme in the phase\nspace (s, \u03bc) for \u03b5 = 0.15. Each black dot corresponds\nto a well converged solution up to machine precision,\nwhereas white spots are associated to either divergent\nor converged-to-zero solutions. In particular, we noted\nthat the numerical scheme converged to localized traveling waves below the gray boundary curve \u0393 shown in\nFigure 3. On the other hand, the convergence to simple periodic waves occurred for points above \u0393. This\ncurve agrees with the analytical form derived from the\nexact nonlinear dispersion of periodic\nwaves, which folp\nlows from (4) as s = (c\u2212e)A2 +2 a(\u03bc \u2212 hA2 ), where A\nis the wave amplitude. Thus, localized traveling waves\nbifurcate from \u0393. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 4,\nwhich reports the change in shape of the envelope |u|\nas s varies while keeping \u03bc = 0.27. In particular, with\nreference to Figure 3, as the point (s, \u03bc = 0.27) reaches\nthe boundary \u0393 from below, the soliton envelope tends\nto flatten to that of a periodic wave.

Hereafter, we do so for the Dysthe equation (4)\nfor the envelope u, but the associated Hamiltonian form\n(8) in w can be treated in a similar way. However, owing\nto the gauge transformation (6) the envelope |w| = |u|.\nWe point out that analytical solutions of (4) are available in terms of multiple-scale perturbations of the NLS\nequation using, for example, direct soliton perturbation\ntheory (see, for example, [1, 14]). Consequently, we construct numerical solutions of ground states and traveling waves of the form u(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = v(\u03c4 \u2212 s\u03be)e\u2212i\u03bc\u03be using\nthe Petviashvili method ([12], see also [10]), where \u03bc\nand s are generic parameters and the function v(*) is\nin general complex. This numerical approach has been\nsuccessfully applied by [17] to compute ground states of\ntheir version of the temporal Dysthe equation.\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\u03c4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 2.

Note that |u| = |w| due to the gauge\ninvariance (6).\n\nhold for the Hamiltonian w due to the gauge transformation (6).\nHereafter, we investigate the collision of traveling waves by means of a highly accurate Fourier-type\npseudo-spectral method (see, for example, [2]). As an\napplication, consider the interaction between two solitary waves of the NLS equation traveling in opposing\ndirections with the same speed s = 2, for \u03bc = 2 (\u03b5 = 0).\nThe shape of the two solitons is identical because of the\nNLS reflection symmetry, i.e. u(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = (\u03be, \u2212\u03c4 ). The\nplot of Figure 5 shows that the two solitons emerge out\nof the collision with the same shape, but a phase shift.\nThe interaction is elastic as it should be since the NLS\nequation is integrable. This is clearly seen from the plot\nof Figure 6, which reports the initial and final shapes\n\n\f4\n\nF. Fedele F., D. Dutykh D.\n\n\u03c4\n\nFigure 3.

For the same parameters,\nFigure 7 reports the interaction of the associated solitary waves of the Dysthe equation (2) for \u03b5 = 0.15. The\nreflection symmetry is lost and the two solitons have different shape and amplitude. The interaction is clearly\ninelastic, since after the collision radiation is shed and\nthe initial and final soliton shapes are different as seen\nin Figure 8. The interaction of four solitons has similar inelastic characteristics as shown in Figure 9. This\nsuggests the non-integrability of the Dysthe equation\n(2).

CONCLUSIONS\n\nA canonical variable for the spatial Dysthe equation\nfor the wave envelope u has been identified by means of\nthe gauge transformation (6), and the hidden Hamiltonian structure is unveiled. Moreover, the gauge invariance yields two new invariants for the noncanonical u.\nIt is also found that the envelope v of the associated\nwave potential is canonical.\nFurther, the existence of solitary waves that bifurcate from periodic waves has been investigated numerically by means of a highly accurate Petviashvili scheme.\nIn particular, ground state solutions are in agreement\nwith the asymptotic analysis of [1]. Finally, the envelope\ndynamics has been investigated by means of highly accurate Fourier-type pseudo-spectral method up to ma-\n\n3. M. Colin and M. Ohta.
