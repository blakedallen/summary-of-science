Such processes could be probed\nin particle accelerator experiments in the very near future. Recently a great deal of effort has been expended\nfor the precise determination of observational signatures\nof such events. Chief among them are the black hole\nproduction cross section and the Hawking radiation spectrum. To date, virtually all the work has been done for\nthe idealized case where the brane tension is completely\nnegligible. This is because it is generically very hard to\nobtain exact solutions of higher-dimensional Einstein's\nequations describing black holes on branes with tension.\nOn the other hand, one generically expects the brane tension to be of the order of the fundamental energy scale\nin theory, being determined by the vacuum energy contributions of brane-localized matter fields.\nRecently, a metric describing a black hole located on\na 3-brane with finite tension, embedded in locally flat\n6-dimensional (6D) spacetime was constructed [6]. In\nspherically symmetric 6D Schwarzschild gauge, this metric can be written as\nh\ndr2\nrh i\n+\n(1)\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212 ( )3 dt2 +\nr\n1 \u2212 ( rrh )3\n\u0002\n\u0003\nr2 {d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + sin2 \u03c6(d\u03c72 + B 2 sin2 \u03c7d\u03c8 2 ) } .\n\n\u03bb\nThe parameter B \u2261 1 \u2212 2\u03c0M\n4 measures the deficit angle\n\u2217\nabout the axis parallel with the 3-brane, in the angular direction \u03c8, because the canonically normalized angle\n\u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8/B runs over the interval [0, 2\u03c0/B]. Here \u03bb is the\nbrane tension, and M\u2217 is the fundamental mass scale of\n6D gravity, defined\ncoefficient of the Ricci scalar\nR as the\n\u221a\nin the 6D action d6 x g6 M\u22174 R6 /2 \u2208 S6D . The black\nhole horizon is at\n\nrh =\n\nrs\n,\nB 1/3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere rs is the conventional 6D Schwarzschild radius,\n\nrs =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n4\u03c0 2\n\n\u0013 13\n\n1\nM\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nMBH\nM\u2217\n\n\u0013 13\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThus the main effect of the brane tension is to change\nthe relation between the black hole mass and horizon\nradius. Then in terms of the geometric quantities, the\nmetric appears the same as the 6D Schwarzschild solution. However, because of the deficit angle, at large distances (r \u226b rh ) the geometry asymptotes to a conical\nbulk space.\nFollowing [7, 8], we take as the black hole production\ncross section its horizon area,\n\u03c3 \u223c \u03c0rh2 .\n\n(4)\n\nIt is interesting to explore how this quantity depends on\nthe brane tension \u03bb. To do this, one must be careful because one must first appropriately compactify the asymptotic geometry of the solution (1), in order to be able to\nthink of it as a small black hole on a brane in large compact dimensions. In this case, the volume of the compact\ndimensions will also depend on the deficit angle B. The\nprecise details depend on the compactification.\nOne simple case would be to imagine ending the space\nfar from the black hole (1) on a cylindrically symmetric\n4-brane [9] and imposing relfection symmetry about it,\nin which case the enclosed 2D volume would be V (2) \u2243\n2\u03c0L2 /B, when the black hole is much smaller than the\nradial size of the extra dimensions, rh \u226a L. Because\nthe 4D Planck mass M4 is determined by the Gauss law\nequation [1],\nM42 \u223c M\u22174 V (2) \u2243\n\n1 4 2\nM L ,\nB \u2217\n\n(5)\n\nit is then possible to vary the tension on our 3-brane,\nand, by matching that with a change of the tension on\nthe cylindrical 4-brane, simultaneously hold M4 and M\u2217\nfixed. This would decrease B and enhance the cross section for a fixed value of M\u2217 and MBH , while the decrease\n\n\f2\nof V (2) from the reduction of the opening angle of the\ncone can be compensated by the increase in the linear\nsize of the extra dimension L, at least in principle.\nObviously, there are restrictions to how far one might\ntake these limits in order to not exceed the sub-millimeter\nbounds on the corrections to gravity, which were recently\nreviewed in [10]. In general, the situation is even more\ncomplicated because one must carefully consider the details of compactification, and its topological and geometric aspects, as well as the presence and deployment of\nany additional branes in the bulk, to determine various\npossible contributions to the Gauss law (5) to see how\nthey compare to the tension-dependent contribution of\nthe black hole-bearing brane. These detailed considerations may also alter the asymptotic form of the metric (1)\nfar from the black hole, as they generally are expected\nto do so in any extra-dimensional framework. This discussion shows that the precise dependence of the black\nhole production cross-section on the brane tension is in\ngeneral not simple, but is sensitive to the details of compactification. For the purposes of our discussion, we can\nhowever ignore this issue, and imagine that we can arrange for a compactification where M\u2217 , M4 and \u03bb are\nfreely tunable parameters. With these assumptions we\ncan treat the solution (1) as a good approximation for a\nsmall black hole on a brane.\nThe smoking gun of black hole production in colliders, and hence of low scale quantum gravity, would be\ntheir decay via Hawking (or rather Hawking-like [11]) radiation. It is therefore essential to accurately calculate\nemission spectra for fields of various spin emitted by a\nblack hole, whose precise nature is encoded in the black\nhole gray-body factors. Now, from the metric (1) it is\nclear that the gray-body factors for the brane-localized\nfields remain formally identical to those calculated for the\ntensionless brane, with the only difference being in the\nrelationship between the black hole mass and the horizon size, and therefore the geometric cross section, as\nencoded in the Eqs. (2), (3) and (4).\nHowever, the fields propagating in the bulk will have\ndifferent gray-body factors. While in the simplest models\nwith large dimensions only the fields from the graviton\nmultiplet are taken to propagate in the bulk, in order to\nsuppress a rapid proton decay, one needs to physically\nseparate quarks from leptons [5]. The simplest way to\nrealize this is to localize quarks and leptons on different\nbranes in the bulk. Then, since gauge fields must interact\nwith both quarks and leptons, they must also be propagate through the section of the bulk between the quark\nand lepton branes. When a small black hole resides on\none of those branes, having been created in a collision of\nmatter particles localized on them, it will emit the gauge\nfields and its possible superpartners as bulk fields. Thus\nit is important to to include bulk fields in the detailed\nblack hole evolution in order to develop the tools for the\nstudy of more realistic braneworlds.\n\nLet us first consider bulk scalars. For small hot black\nholes we can ignore the scalar field masses and simply\nanalyze the equation of motion of a massless bulk scalar\n\u0003\u03a8 = 0, where \u03a8 propagates in the background (1). We\ncan separate this equation into the radial and angular\nparts,\n\nand\n\n\u0011\n\u03c92\n\u03b7\n1 d\u0010 4 d\nR(r) + (\n\u2212 2 )R(r) = 0 ,\nFr\n4\nr dr\ndr\nF\nr\n\n(6)\n\n\u22064 Y (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c7, \u03c8) = \u2212\u03b7Y (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c7, \u03c8) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u22064 is the \u0002Laplacian on the deformed 4-sphere\n\u0003\nds24 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + sin2 \u03c6(d\u03c72 + B 2 sin2 \u03c7d\u03c8 2 ) .\nHere \u03b7 is the separation constant, F = (1 \u2212 ( rrh )3 ),\nand B measures the deficit angle. For tensionless brane,\nB = 1, the angular equation reduces to the one for the\nspherically symmetric scalar field. The solutions can be\nwritten as the expansion in hyper-spherical harmonics\nwith eigenvalues \u03b7 = L(L + 3) [12]. For each fixed L\nthere is (2L + 3)(L + 2)(L + 1)/6 states. When B 6= 1,\nspherical symmetry is broken, and eigenvalues and degeneracies will change, although the total number of states\nwill remain the same.\nTo proceed with the general case B 6= 1, we separate the Eq. (7) further, by writing Y (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c7, \u03c8) =\n\u0398(\u03b8)\u03a6(\u03c6)\u0393(\u03c7)\u039e(\u03c8). This yields four angular equations\n1 d\u0010 3 d \u0011\n\u03b73 \u0398\n= \u2212\u03b7\u0398 ,\n3 d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 \u0398 \u2212\nsin \u03b8\nsin2 \u03b8\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\n\u03b72 \u03a6\n1 d\n= \u2212\u03b73 \u03a6 ,\nsin2 \u03c6 \u03a6 \u2212\n2\nd\u03c6\nsin \u03c6 d\u03c6\nsin2 \u03c6\nd \u0011\n1 d \u0010\n\u03b71 \u0393\nsin \u03c7 \u0393 \u2212\n= \u2212\u03b72 \u0393 ,\nsin \u03c7 d\u03c7\nd\u03c7\nsin2 \u03c7\n1 d2\n\u039e = \u2212\u03b71 \u039e .\n(8)\nB 2 d\u03c8 2\nThe solutions will therefore be classified by four quantum\nnumbers, (L, l1 , l2 , m) which determine the four eigenvalues (\u03b7, \u03b73 , \u03b72 , \u03b71 ) respectively. L, l1 , l2 and m are\nnon-negative integers (negative m's will have the same\neigenvalues as positive ones, so we can restrict to m > 0\nwithout any loss of generality), and we have the hierarchy\nL \u2265 l1 \u2265 l2 \u2265 |m|. In the limit of B = 1, spherical symmetry implies \u03b7 = L(L+3), \u03b73 = l1 (l1 +2), \u03b72 = l2 (l2 +1),\n\u03b71 = m2 . In this limit spherical symmetry implies that\nthe eigenvalue \u03b7 depends only on the quantum number\nL. However when B 6= 1, spherical symmetry is broken\nand \u03b7 depends on two quantum numbers, i.e. m and L.\nTo determine the black hole power, we thus need to determine degeneracies NL,m in the states labelled by m\nand L. We find\n(L + 2)(L + 1)\n,\n2\n= (L \u2212 m + 2)(L \u2212 m + 1) .\n\nscal\nm = 0 : NL,m\n=\nscal\nm 6= 0 : NL,m\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nWe emphasize here that only the eigenvalue \u03b7 appears\nin the radial equation (6). However, because the eigenvalues are coupled, to find \u03b7 one still needs to solve the\nfull system of equations (8). To determine \u03b7, we adopt\nthe numerical technique following the Chapter 17.4 of\n[13], and rewrite the first three equations in (8) as:\nd \u0010 k d \u0011\n\u03b7k\n1\nsin \u03b1 P + (\u2212 2 + \u03b7k+1 )P = 0 . (10)\nk\nd\u03b1\nsin \u03b1\nsin \u03b1 d\u03b1\nThe parameter k takes the values k = 3, 2, 1 and the\nangle \u03b1 stands for \u03b8, \u03c6 and \u03c7 for the first, second and\nthird equation in (8) respectively. After setting x = cos \u03b1\nand changing thepfunction P to P = (1 \u2212 x2 )n T with\nn = (\u2212(k \u2212 1) + (k \u2212 1)2 + 4\u03b7k )/4, we obtain\n\n(h)\n\n(\u221e) e\n\n(12)\n\nThe two different boundary conditions at x = 0 correspond to symmetric (i.e. dT /dx = 0) and antisymmetric\n(i.e. T = 0) solutions. We can then use the shooting\nmethod to solve for the eigenvalue \u03b7. In Fig. 1 one can\nsee how this eigenvalue changes with B in nine branches\nof L. The m = 0 branch does not change with B. However m 6= 0 branches increase quickly as the brane tension\n\u03bb increases, and so B decreases. We note here that the\nincrease in the eigenvalue will result in the reduction of\nthe power of emitted radiation.\n\n(\u221e)\n\n2\n\n|\u00c3L,m | = 1 \u2212\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nr2\n\n.\n\nL=9\n\n0.0020\n\nL=8\n\n0.0018\n\nAout\n\n(\u221e)\n\nAin\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nL=5\nL=4\nL=3\nL=2\nL=1\n\n1.0\n\nB\n\n(15)\n\nB->0\nB=0.4\nB=0.6\nB=0.8\n\n0.0016\n\nL=7\nL=6\n\n(13)\n\n3\nis the Hawking temperature.

Increasing the brane tension, and so decreasing B, while assuming that M4 and\nM\u2217 are held fixed, reduces the emitted power. We note\nhere that most of the m 6= 0 modes have large values for \u03b7\nand are thus suppressed with respect to the m = 0 mode,\nin agreement with the statement that most of Hawking\nradiation from a non-rotating black hole is emitted in the\ns-wave channel [3] (see also [14]).\n\n-1\n\n100\n\ni\u03c9r\n\nand then, using the principle of detailed balance, write\ndown the spectrum of Hawking radiation,\n\n(rh )\n\n120\n\nr2\n\n(\u221e) e\n\n+ Aout\n\nHere, r\u2217 is a \"tortoise\" coordinate defined by dr\u2217 =\n(h)\ndr/F .

B changes from B = 1 (tensionless brane)\nto B = 0 (deficit angle equal to 2\u03c0).\n\n\f4\nWe should stress that our method of calculating the\nHawking radiance by bulk mode expansion is completely\nequivalent to first performing the Kaluza-Klein reduction\nof bulk scalar perturbations and then expanding in the\nSO(3) representations reflecting the black hole horizon\nsymmetry. This way of thinking about organizing the\ncalculation is particularly useful in computing the higher\nspin emissions, which we turn to next.\nThe calculation of Hawking radiance for bulk vectors\nand tensors goes similarly to the one for scalars, with\nthe exception that one has to properly account for the\nhelicity multiplets. Namely, in the case of massless 4D\nvectors and tensors, gauge symmetries ensure that the\nonly propagating modes are, in the traceless-transverse\nLorentz and de Donder gauge, respectively, the helicity1 and helicity-2 modes, like the usual Maxwell and Einstein fields. However, in the higher-dimensional case they\nare accompanied by the Kaluza-Klein towers of massive\nmodes. These have less gauge symmetry and hence contain more propagating degrees of freedom, including extra scalars, and scalars and vectors in the bulk vector\nand bulk tensor cases, respectively, which span the full\nmassive 4D vector and tensor multiplets [15].\nNow, in computing the Hawking radiance from small\nhot black holes we can neglect the 4D mass for most of\nthese modes since they lie well below the cutoff while the\nblack hole's temperature is close to it, but these extra\nmodes still carry away the black hole energy. Thus we\nmust take them into account. A simple way to do this is\nto dimensionally decompose the relevant representations\ninto 4D tensors, vectors and scalars, as has been done in\n[16, 17, 18], with respect to the transverse space to the\ndirection of motion. In practice, this means counting the\ntensor representations over the deformed transverse S 4 in\nEq. (1), because by the axial symmetries of the problem\nthe energy will flow radially outward from the hole. Thus\nthe radial direction and the time can be factored out.\nThen, by going to the unitary gauge, we will find that\neach degree of freedom obeys a field equation similar to\nthe one for scalars. Working out the details, one can show\nthat the master equation for the radial part of a higher\ndimensional gauge boson or graviton field (see [16, 17,\n18]) propagating in the background of the black hole (1)\nis\nd2 \u03a8\n+ (\u03c9 2 \u2212 V (r))\u03a8 = 0 ,\ndr\u22172\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\nV (r) = F (\n\n\u03b7\n2\n4(1 \u2212 p2 )\n+\n+\n).\nr2\nr2\nr5\n\n(17)\n\nThe constant p is given by 0 for scalars and tensor gravitons, 2 for gravi-vectors, 1/2 for gauge vectors and 3/2 for\nscalar reductions of bulk vectors. For example, as a quick\ncheck we can see that setting p = 0 and \u03a8 = r2 R in (16)\nwe readily recover Eq. (6).) One further finds that for\n\nthe higher spin fields the angular quantum number L is\nrestricted by the spin, so that its range is [16, 17, 18, 19]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 0, 1... for scalar perturbation ,\nL = 1, 2... for vector perturbation ,\n\uf8f3\n2, 3... for tensor perturbation .\n\nFinally for gravitational scalar perturbations one finds\n[16, 18]\nV =F\n\nQ(r)\n,\n16r2 H(r)2\n\n(18)\n\nwith\nQ(r) = 6400r\u22129 + 1920(\u03b7 \u2212 4)r\u22126 \u2212 1920(\u03b7 \u2212 4)r\u22123\n\n+ 16(\u03b7 \u2212 4)3 + 96(\u03b7 \u2212 4) ,\nH(r) = (\u03b7 \u2212 4) + 10r\u22123 .\n\n(19)\n\nWhat then remains is to determine the eigenvalues \u03b7\nand the and the number of states for each fixed \u03b7. This\nnumber depends on the helicity, and for the scalars the\nscal\ndegeneracy NL,m\nis the same as in Eq. (10). For the\nvectors, one needs to account properly for gauge fixing\nwhen counting the solutions of the angular equation of\nmotion [19]. In the end the vector degeneracies depend\nonly on the helicity and not on how it is lifted into the\nbulk, yielding\nL(3L + 5)\n(20)\n2\n= 3(L \u2212 m + 2)(L \u2212 m + 1) .\n\nvec\nm = 0 : NL,m\n=\nvec\nm 6= 0 : NL,m\n\nIn the case of transverse-traceless tensors, the problem\nof solving the gauge fixed angular equation is more difficult. To determine the degeneracies, we need to solve\n\u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 satisfying gauge conditions \u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0\nand T \u03bc \u03bc = 0, where \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 is the covariant Laplacian\non S 4 , and all the indices \u03b1, \u03bc, \u03bd run over the deformed\ntransverse sphere of Eq. (1), as we noted above. Now,\nbelow some high (angular!) momentum cutoff, the total number of states is the same as in the spherically\nsymmetric limit, computed in [20] and summarized in\nthe Table I of that paper. The only effect of broken\nspherical symmetry is splitting between some of the levels that were degenerate on S 4 . Then for L \u2265 |m| \u2265 2\nthe transverse-traceless tensor can be viewed as an array\nof five scalars, and we can simply count up the number\nof states for each of them and add them up. This yields\nten\nNL,m\n= 5(L \u2212 m + 2)(L \u2212 m + 1) for L \u2265 |m| \u2265 2. What\nremains then is to account for the states with m = 0, 1.\nWe can do this by taking the total number of states from\n[20], subtracting all the states with |m| \u2265 2, whose number we just worked out, and recalling that the number of\nstates with L = 2, m = 0 is really the number of independent s-wave modes in the full 6D graviton multiplet at\nsome fixed mass level. Since the number of independent\n\n\f5\npropagating modes of a 6D graviton is nine, we must fix\nN (L = 2, m = 0) = 9. This then uniquely determines\nthe degeneracies to be\n\nB->0\n0.008\n\nB=0.4\nB=0.6\n\n0.007\n\n(rh )\n\nten\nm \u2265 2 : NL,m\n= 5(L \u2212 m + 2)(L \u2212 m + 1) .

This is the total power emitted\nin the frequency band d\u03c9. For the power emitted per\ndegree of freedom, we ought to divide the result (22) by\nfour for a gauge boson and by nine for graviton, since 6D\nbulk vectors and tensors have 4 and 9 degrees of freedom,\nrespectively, as we have discussed above.\nWe have computed the power (22) numerically for the\nrelevant vector and tensor modes. In Fig. 3 we show\nthe dependence of the Hawking radiation spectrum for\nbulk vectors on the brane tension, while in Fig. 4 we\ndisplay the dependence of the radiance on tension for\nthe graviton field. Finally, for completeness, in Fig. 5\nwe show the Hawking spectrum of brane-localized fields,\nwhich for a fixed horizon size rh does not depend on the\ntension. Of course, the horizon size rh depends on the\ntension as given in Eq. (2). In order to get the power per\nchannel from the total power displayed in Fig. (5), we\nneed to halve the fermion and gauge boson distribution.\nIn sum, collider searches for black holes may be an exciting and interesting source of information about extra\ndimensions, complementing possible astrophysical tests\n(for recent exploration of those, see [21]). In this note\nwe have explored the Hawking decay channels for a recently constructed exact black hole localized on a 3-brane\n[6]. We see that brane tension may alter significantly\nthe power output of small black holes located on the\nbrane. While for the non-rotating black holes the dominant channels are still the brane-localized modes, in realistic models with split fermions as in [5], the gauge\nboson contribution to black hole radiance may be significant. Since they need to be in the bulk to communicate\nbetween different (families of) quarks and leptons, the\ngauge boson emissions may be a sensitive probe of deficit\nangle and therefore brane tension.

This may appear slightly odd at first sight\nsince increasing the tension for fixed M4 strengthens effective bulk gravity [6]. However, when the horizon rh\nis held fixed, this comes about because the gravitational\npotential barrier depends on the eigenvalue \u03b7, which as\nseen in Fig. (1) increases as the parameter B decreases,\nand tension increases. Therefore the potential barrier\ngrows reducing the rate of energy loss. Similarly, at fixed\nblack hole mass increasing the tension would simultaneously increase the horizon size, lowering the temperature\nand increasing the black hole entropy. Hence in this case\na black hole will also radiate away its mass more slowly.\nIf we ever produce small black holes at the LHC, the\n\n\f6\n\n0.024\n\nscalar field\n0.022\n\nfermion\n\n0.020\n\ngauge boson\n\n[3]\n\n2\nd E/dtd\n\n-1\n\n(rh )\n\n0.018\n0.016\n\n[4]\n\n0.014\n0.012\n0.010\n\n[5]\n\n0.008\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-1\n(rh )\n\nFIG. 5: Hawking radiation of brane localized fields: a scalar,\na fermion and a vector gauge boson. For fixed horizon size\nthey are not affected by the finite tension of the brane.\n\ntotal Hawking radiance will be a sum of the power emitting along the brane and off of it. In simple toy models\nthe emission into the bulk would be subleading because\nof the s-wave dominance, leading to essentially negligible bulk effects. However in more realistic models with\nsplit fermions and gauge fields in the bulk, the balance\nbetween contributions from the brane and bulk modes\nmay end up being significantly tilted in favor of the increasing number of bulk modes. While the precise details\nof course would be very model dependent, in such cases\nthe off the wall contributions may be significant, and so\nthe effects we have described here may play an important role, warranting a careful and detailed examination\nof Hawking radiation losses.\nAcknowledgment\nNK and GDS thank the Galileo Galilei Institute, Florence, for kind hospitality in the course of this work.\nGDS also thanks the Beecroft Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology and The Queen's College, Oxford\nfor hospitality and support.
