Then the symmetry is extended in six dimensions so that it insures absence of 4dimensional cosmological constant induced by the six dimensional curvature scalar, at least, for a\nclass of metrics. A small cosmological constant may be induced in this scheme by breaking of the\nsymmetry by a small amount.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: recaierdem@iyte.edu.tr\n\n1\n\n\fCosmological constant problem is a long standing problem [1]. The problem can be\nstated as the huge discrepancy between the observational and the theoretically expected\nvalues of the cosmological constant [2] and the lack of understanding of its extremely small\nvalue [3]. Numerous schemes, to solve this problem, range from the models which employ\nsupersymmetry, supergravity, superstrings, anthropic principles, modified general relativity,\nself-tuning mechanisms, quantum cosmology, extra dimensions, and combinations of these\nideas [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Although they shed some light on the direction of the solution of this\nproblem, they have not given a wholly satisfactory, widely accepted answer to this question.\nAmong these attempts extra dimensional models become more popular because they give\nmodel builders more flexibility [5, 6, 7]. This is mainly due to the fact the no-go theorem\nof Weinberg [2] is intrinsically four dimensional; for example, the equations of motion for\na field constant in 4-dimensions may contain a contribution from extra dimensional kinetic\nterm in the Lagrangian hence making the Weinberg's argument non-applicable in higher\ndimensions. Moreover the models where a four dimensional space is embedded in a higher\ndimensional space may have striking differences. For example four dimensional world may\nbe embedded in extra dimensions in such a way that the 4-dimensional brane remains flat\nunder energy density changes on the brane through the counter balance of the curvature\ndue to the extra dimensions and the brane tension [7]. However these models, although\nappealing, at present have some technical problems such as need for large extra dimensions\nwhich may be in conflict with astronomical data, fine tuning, technicalities with quantum\nloop corrections, severe restrictions on dilaton-brane couplings [8]. So additional insight on\nthe cosmological constant in extra dimensions may be useful. In this paper we study the\nimplications of a symmetry, similar to scale invariance with a complex scale factor, on the\ncosmological constant. In fact it seems that such a symmetry principle was also noticed\nby 't Hooft (though unpublished) [9]. We find that this symmetry forbids a non-zero bulk\ncosmological constant in 6 and 10 dimensions. We consider the 6 dimensional case in this\npaper. We extend the symmetry so that the contribution to the cosmological constant due\nto the extra dimensional curvature scalar vanishes as well. We find that breaking of the\nsymmetry by a small amount may result in a small cosmological costant in this scheme. We\nalso briefly discuss the restriction put on the form of matter Lagrangian by this symmetry.\n\n2\n\n\fConsider the transformation which multiplies the coordinates by the imaginary number i\nxA \u2192 i xA ,\n\nA = 0, 1, ......, D \u2212 1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D stands for the dimension of the space. This transformation may be viewed as an\nanalytic continuation followed by a rotation by\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nin each complex plane. We impose the\n\nsymmetry\ngAB \u2192 gAB\n\nas\n\nxA \u2192 i xA ,\n\nA = 0, 1, ......, D \u2212 1\n\n(2)\n\nUnder Eq.(2) the scalar curvature is multiplied by \u22121\nR \u2192 \u2212R\n\n(3)\n\nand\ndD x\ndD x \u2192\n\n\u2212 dD x\n\u00b1 i dD x\n\nif D = 4n\n\n(4)\n\nif D = 2(2n + 1)\n\n(5)\n\nif D = 2n + 1\n\n(6)\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, 3, .............\nThe requirement that Einstein-Hilbert action\n1\nSR =\n16\u03c0 G\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\ng R dD x\n\n(7)\n\nshould be invariant under (2) selects out\nD = 2(2n + 1) ,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, 3, ....\n\n(8)\n\nIn fact, in the case of exact symmetry the action should be invariant up to a multiplicative\nconstant because the equations of motion remain the same. However, if the symmetry is\nbroken ( even by a small amount which is the physical situation) then the part of the\naction respecting the symmetry must be strictly invariant since each constant multiplying\nthe symmetry preserving part of the action leads to a different equation of motion in general\nafter taking the symmetry breaking part into account. Another point worthwhile to mention\nis that under Eq.(2)\nds2 \u2192 \u2212 ds2\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fThis implies a symmetry under exchange of space-like and time-like intervals. The implications of this transformation need a separate study.\nWe notice from the equations (3) and (5) that the cosmological constant term for the\naction\n1\nSC =\n16\u03c0 G\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\ng \u039b dD x\n\n(10)\n\n( where \u039b is constant in xA , A = 0, 1, ....D \u2212 1 ) is not allowed by the symmetry induced by\nEq.(1) for D's satisfying (8). Under the requirement D \u2265 4 and D \u2264 10 (which comes from\nstring theory) the only possible dimensions allowed by the symmetry induced by (2) are 6\nand 10.\nIn this paper we study the minimal case i.e. D = 6 case. It is evident that an SR\nterm is not allowed in D = 4. On the other hand a cosmological constant term, Eq.(10) is\nallowed in 4 dimensions. In other words, although the invariance of the action under (2)\nforbids a six dimensional cosmological constant it does not forbid a 4-dimensional one. So a\n4-dimensional cosmological constant may be induced through the six dimensional curvature\nscalar even if there is no contribution to it through a six dimensional bulk cosmological\nconstant. A D-dimensional curvature scalar ( D > 4 ) may be written as\nR = R1 (x\u03bc , xa ) + R2 (xa ) ,\n\n\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3 ;\n\na = 4, 5, ......., D \u2212 1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere R2 is the part of the curvature scalar which is independent of x\u03bc (i.e. R2 depends only\non the extra dimensions) and R1 is the part which contains x\u03bc -dependent and the mixed\nterms. A non-vanishing R2 in general introduces a cosmological constant in 4-dimensions. So\none must impose a symmetry which eliminates R2 as well in order to make the 4-dimensional\ncosmological constant zero altogether.\nThe local 4-dimensional Poincare invariance in six dimensions results in the metric [10]\nds2 = \u03c3(xa )g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + gab (xa )dxa dxb\n\n, \u03bc\u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3 ; a, b = 4, 5\n\n(12)\n\nIn addition to the symmetry (2) we require\ngAB \u2192 gAB\n\nas x4 \u2194 x5\n\n(13)\n\nand take\ng44 = \u2212g55\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\f( which may be obtained by imposing gab dxa dxb \u2192 gab dxa dxb under Eq.(2) ). Under these\nrequirements we find that the extra dimensional components of the Riemann tensor are zero,\nRab = 0, and its 4-dimensional part R\u03bc\u03bd depends only on the 4-dimensional coordinates x\u03bc .\nSo R2 (xa ) = 0 in this case. In other words the local 4-dimensional Poincare invariance\ntogether with the requirements Eqs.(13-14) guarantee the absence of a contribution from\n6-dimensional curvature scalar to the 4-dimensional cosmological constant.\nWe have introduced the symmetry (2) to eliminate the 6-dimensional bulk cosmological\nconstant and the symmetry (13-14)) to eliminate a possible contribution to the 4-dimensional\ncosmological constant from 6-dimensional curvature scalar. Now we give some examples first\nto see the picture more clearly and then consider the case of the symmetry breaking by a\nsmall amount. First take the metric\nds2 = \u03a921 (y)g\u03bc\u03bd (x) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + \u03a922 (y)\u03b7ab dy ady b\n(\u03b7ab ) = diag(\u22121, 1)\n\n(15)\n\n\u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3 ; a, b = 1, 2\n\ny1 = x4 , y2 = x5\n\nwhere x stands for the 4-dimensional coordinates and y for the extra dimensional coordinates.\nProvided that the metric tensor is a smooth function of y the curvature scalar corresponding\nto (15) is\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u22122\nab\nab\nR = \u03a9\u22122\n1 g R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03a91 [10\u03b7 \u2202a \u2202b (ln\u03a91 ) + 20\u03b7 \u2202a (ln\u03a91 )\u2202b \u03a91 ]\nab\nab\n+ 2 \u03a9\u22122\n2 [\u03b7 \u2202a \u2202b (ln\u03a91 ) \u2212 \u03b7 \u2202a \u2202b (ln\u03a92 )]\n\nLet us consider the case where\n\u03a91 = \u03a91 (k1 y1 + k2 y2 ) ,\n\n\u03a92 = \u03a92 (k3 y1 + k4 y2 )\n\ny1 = x4 , y2 = x5\n\n(16)\n\nThen the curvature scalar is obtained as\nd ln\u03a91 2\nd2 (ln\u03a91 )\n) ]\n+ 20(\n2\ndu1\ndu1\n2\n2\n2\n2 d (ln\u03a92 )\n\u22122 2\n2 d (ln\u03a92 )\n+ 2\u03a9\u22122\n(k\n\u2212\nk\n)\n\u2212\n2\u03a9\n(k\n\u2212\nk\n)\n2\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\ndu21\ndu22\nu 1 = k1 y 1 + k2 y 2\nu 2 = k3 y 1 + k4 y 2\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u22122 2\n2\nR = \u03a9\u22122\n1 g R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03a91 (k1 \u2212 k2 )[10\n\n(17)\n\nBecause k1 , k2 are projected out by \u22021 , \u22022 they transform under (1) like \u22021 , \u22022 ; respectively\nka \u2192 \u2212i ka\n\nas\n\nxa \u2192 i xa\n5\n\na = 1, 2\n\n(18)\n\n\fSo k1 y1 + k2 y2 is automatically invariant under (1) hence \u03a91 , \u03a92 automatically obey (2).\nThe application of the requirement, Eq.(13) to \u03a91 and \u03a92 results in\nk1 = k2\n\n,\n\nk3 = k4\n\n(19)\n\nSo the extra dimensional contribution to the curvature scalar i.e. R2 in (11) vanishes. In\nother words the symmetry (13-14) requires the contribution to the cosmological constant\nfrom the extra dimensional curvature scalar be zero as well. The metric given in (16) is a\nsmooth function of x4 , x5 . So the form of metric and the fact one of the extra dimensions\n2\n2\nis space-like and the other is space-like [11] brings the over-all factors of k1(3)\n\u2212 k2(4)\nwhich\n\nvanish in the limit of the symmetry (14) to make the curvature scalar zero. However if the\n2\n2\nmetric tensor is not a smooth function of xA then R2 does not have k1(3)\n\u2212 k2(4)\nas over-all\n\nfactors however R2 is still zero. To be more specific we consider a metric of the form of (15)\nand (16) with\n\u03a921 = cos(|k1 y1 || + |k2y2 |)\n\n\u03a922 = 0\n\ny1 = x4 , y2 = x5\n\n(20)\n\nwhere a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orbifold symmetry induced by k1 y1 \u2192 \u2212k1 y1 k2 y2 \u2192 \u2212k2 y2 to get the\nabsolute value signs in (20) and two branes located at the points k1 y1 = 0, k2 y2 = 0,\nk1 y1 = \u03c0, k2 y2 = \u03c0. By using Eq.(17) we obtain the curvature scalar as\nR=\n\n1\n[ g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd + 10 k12 tan u \u03b4 \u03031 \u2212 10 k22 tan u \u03b4 \u03032 + 5(k12 \u2212 k22 )] (21)\ncos(|k1 y1 || + |k2 y2 |)\nu = |k1 y1 | + |k2 y2 |\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u03031 = \u03b4(k1 y1 ) \u2212 \u03b4(k1 y1 \u2212 \u03c0), \u03b4 \u03032 = \u03b4(k2 y2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(k2 y2 \u2212 \u03c0) and g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd depends only\non x\u03bc . Each delta function defines a 5-dimensional subspace and the intersections of these\n5-dimensional subspaces define four 3-branes which consist of two pairs of 3-branes related\nby the reversal of their signatures. We see that R2 due to Eq.(21) is zero in this case as well\nwhen k1 = k2 (i.e. when the symmetry in Eq.(14) is exact) after R is integrated over y1 and\ny2 .\nOne must break this symmetry by a small amount in order to get a small cosmological\nconstant in agreement with observations. First we consider the metric (20). Assume that\nthe symmetry imposed by (14) is broken for the metric (20) by a small amount k1 \u2212 k2 = \u2206.\nThen the 4-dimensional cosmological constant induced by R2 is approximately equal to\n2k1 \u2206\n16\u03c0 G\n\nZ\n\n5 cos2 u dy1dy2 =\n6\n\n5\u03c0 k1 \u2206\n4G|k1|2\n\n(22)\n\n\fWe notice that the induced cosmological constant\n\u039b(4) =\n\n20k1\u03c0 2 \u2206\n|k1 |2\n\n(23)\n\nwill be even closer to zero if k1 \u2248 k2 is large and the smallness of the cosmological constant\nis protected by the symmetry. We have shown that the breaking of the symmetry for the\nmetric (20) leads to a a small cosmological constant provided the symmetry is broken by\na small amount. In other words a small breaking of the symmetry does not lead to a big\ncosmological constant. Now we get a more general conclusion for the more general class of\nmetrics (12). The Einstein equations corresponding to a conformally transformed metric\n\u03a92 g\u03bc\u03bd relate to the Einstein equations corresponding to the original metric in six dimensions\nas\nG\u0303AB = GAB + 4\u03b4Aa \u03b4Bb (\u2202a ln\u03a9\u2202b ln\u03a9 \u2212 \u2202a \u2202b ln\u03a9) + g\u0303AB (6\u03b7 ab \u2202a ln\u03a9\u2202a ln\u03a9 + 4\u03b7 ab \u2202a \u2202b ln\u03a9) (24)\nwhere G\u0303AB = R\u0303AB \u2212 21 g\u0303AB R\u0303 is the Einstein tensor corresponding to g\u0303AB = \u03a92 gAB and\n\nGAB = RAB \u2212 21 gAB is the Einstein tensor corresponding to gAB . The terms containing \u03a9\non the right-hand side of (24) may be identified as the terms corresponding to the energymomentum tensor induced by the conformal transformation. Meanwhile we observe that\nDirac delta function can be written as\nlim \u03b1[1 \u2212 tanh2 (\u03b1z)] = \u03b4(z)\n\n(25)\n\n\u03b1\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich follows from the fact that the derivative of step function gives the Dirac delta function.\nIf we let ln\u03a9 = \u03b2 ln cosh \u03b1(y1 \u2212 y0 ) then the non-vanishing terms in Eq.(24) give\n\u22021 ln\u03a9\u22021 ln\u03a9 \u2192 \u03b2 2 \u03b12\n\nand\n\n\u22021 \u22021 ln\u03a9 \u2192 \u03b2 \u03b4(y1 \u2212 y01 )\n\nas \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e\n\n(26)\n\nA small \u03b2 corresponds to the breaking of the symmetry by a small amount. If we take\n\u03b2 = \u01eb \u03b11 where \u01eb << 1 then a small perturbation in energy-momentum distribution leads to\nan even smaller bulk cosmological constant and results in an over-all rescaling of the metric\nby \u03a9.\nThe restriction put on the form of the matter Lagrangian by the symmetry Eq.(2) can\nbe determined by requiring the invariance of the corresponding action which requires the\nLagrangian L transform as, L \u2192 (\u2212i)D L. Then the transformation rule for the scalar field\nfollows as\n1\n1 AB\ng \u2202A \u03c6\u2202B \u03c6 \u2192 (\u2212i)D g AB \u2202A \u03c6\u2202B \u03c6 implies\n2\n2\n7\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 (\u2212i)\n\n(D\u22122)\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n(27)\n\n\fThe mass term, 21 m2 \u03c62 is compatible with this symmetry since m2 \u2192 \u2212m2 (which follows\n\nfrom p2 = m2 ). However a \u03c64 term is not compatible with this symmetry (unless D = 4).\nSo this symmetry implies that \u03c64 terms may be induced only on 4 dimensional branes. This\ntogether with the zero ( or almost zero) value of cosmological constant requires a two branes\n( or even number of branes) scenario where \u03c64 terms are induced at both of the branes\nsimultaneously and their contribution cancel ( or almost cancel) after integrated out over\nthe extra dimensions. The transformation rule for fermions follows as\ni\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 A \u2202A \u03c8 \u2192 (\u2212i)D i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 A \u2202A \u03c8\n\nimplies\n\n\u03c8 \u2192 (\u2212i)\n\n(D\u22121)\n2\n\n\u03c8\n\n(28)\n\nThe mass term m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8, the fermion-scalar interaction term and the fermion - gauge boson\ninteraction term i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 A BA \u03c8, all are compatible with the symmetry. while\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8\u03c6 \u2192 (\u2212i)\n\n3D\u22124\n2\n\n(29)\n\nis compatible with the symmetry only for D = 4. So this term may only be induced on a\n4-dimensional brane. Because \u2202A and BA are combined in the covariant derivative \u2202A \u2212 iBA ,\nBA must transform in the same way as \u2202A . This implies that the gauge field kinetic term\n\u2212 14 FAB F AB\nFAC F AC = (\u2202A BC \u2212 \u2202C BA )(\u2202 A B C \u2212 \u2202 C B A ) \u2192 (\u2212i)D FAC F AC\n\n(30)\n\nis also compatible with the symmetry.\nA comment is in order at this point. We have found in the above paragraph that the\nmass terms are allowed in all dimensions unlike the usual scale invariant field theories and\nthe result of Nobbenhuis [9] although he uses the same symmetry as the one given here.\nThe difference between the conclusions come from the difference in the identification of how\nmass terms behave under the scaling transformation. In the usual scale invariance and in the\nNobbenhuis's study [9] masses are taken to be invariant under the symmetry transformation\nwhile in this study the masses transform like momenta (p2 = m2 ). In fact the approach in\nthe present study is in agreement with the identification of mass terms as the kinetic terms\nof the higher dimensions and under this condition this is the only consistent transformation\nprovided that one scales all the dimensions simultaneously. Otherwise it means that either\none does not scale all the dimensions or does not consider the mass terms as the kinetic terms\nof higher dimensions. In fact the difference in the approach to the scaling property of mass\n8\n\n\fterm is just a matter of convenience. It depends on one's aim of using the scale invariance.\nIf one just tries to get phenomenological results confined to relatively low energies where\nthe extra dimensions related to the masses are not observable one should take the masses be\ninvariant under scale transformation. However if one tries to get general results applicable\nto all dimensions ( as is the case in this study) one should transform the mass terms like\nmomenta because it is just the kinetic term written in another form in this case. Another\ndifference between the result of Nobbenhuis and mine is that he reaches the conclusion that\nthe cosmological constant must vanish in the usual four dimensions, D = 4 while I obtain\nthe same result for D = 2(2n+ 1) i.e D = 2, 6, 10. This difference is due to different methods\nemployed in the implementation of the symmetry. Nobbenhuis uses the covariance of the\nequations of motion ( i.e Einstein field equations) under the symmetry employed in this\npaper while I use the invariance of the action functional under the same symmetry as the\nbasis of my arguments. The requirement, of the covariance of the Einstein equations, used\nin Nobbenhuis's study leads to the result that the Einstein tensor and cosmological constant\ncan not coexist, either of them must vanish. This method does not tell anything about the\nallowed number of dimensions. The conclusion of Nobbenhuis depends on the assumption\nthat the Einstein tensor is already allowed in four dimension, so the cosmological constant\nmust vanish. On the other hand the requirement, of the invariance of the action, used in the\npresent study does not only give the result that both of the cosmological constant and the\nEinstein tensor can not coexist but it also leads to the formula for the number of dimensions,\nD = 2(2n + 1) = 2, 6, 10, .., which forbid a non-vanishing cosmological constant. In other\nwords in our analysis the Ricci scalar can not be four dimensional in origin, it must be\ninduced, as an effective four dimensional Ricci scalar, from higher dimensions ( e.g. from\na 6 dimensional Ricci scalar) so that it has some hidden invariance under the symmetry (\nthrough the extra dimensional parameters which are integrated out).\nGiven the fact that the symmetry employed here is a sub-case of the complexified version\nof the scale invariance ( hence of the conformal invariance) and the fact that there are some\nserious problems with the quantization of the classical field theories with conformal invariance [12] ( especially in dimensions other than two ) one may wonder if a similar problem\nexists for this symmetry, that is, if the symmetry introduced in this paper is preserved after\nquantization. It is a well-known fact that the lack of persistence of the scale invariance in\nquantum field theory results from the non-invariance of the correlation functions ( i.e n9\n\n\fpoint functions) under scale invariance. This non-invariance results in the nonconservation\nof the Noether current due to the breakdown of the scale symmetry after the quantization.\nThis, in turn, induces conformal anomalies which are rather difficult to manage (especially\nin dimensions other than two). This situation is improved in the case of the symmetry\nintroduced in this paper. As it is evident from Eqs.(27, 28, 30) the 2-point functions ( which\nserve as the building blocks for n-point functions) scale as (\u2212i)(D\u22122) for scalars and gauge\nfields and scale as (\u2212i)(D\u22121) for fermions. Therefore the 2-point functions are invariant\nunder this symmetry in the dimensions D \u2212 2 = 4n (D = 4n + 2) for scalars and gauge\nfields and in D \u2212 1 = 4n (D = 4n + 1) for fermions (where n = 0, 1, 2, ....). Hence one\nmay speculate models where the renormalizability of the model for scalars-gauge fields and\nfermions is manifest at different dimensions higher than four ( e.g, say at D = 11 or D = 7\nfor fermions and at D = 10 or D = 6 for scalars and gauge fields) and at lower dimensions\nthe theory behaves as an effective theory with a ( in some sense) hidden symmetry. For the\ntime being, these remarks are just speculations . A detailed study of this topic is necessary\nto arrive reliable conclusions about this point. In any case, with respect to quantization,\nthis symmetry seems to be more promising than the usual scale symmetry.\nI hope that this study will give additional insight towards the solution of the cosmological\nconstant problem. However there is more work to be done in this direction. The metric\nemployed here is static so the cosmological constant is constant in time. The need for\ninflation in the history of the universe needs a much larger value for the cosmological constant\nin the early universe. So the next step should be making the metric time dependent to get a\ntime dependent cosmological constant. The self-tuning solutions with large extra dimensions\ndiscussed in the introduction [8] need smaller sizes for the extra dimensions in the inflationary\nuniverse era to get larger cosmological constants in that era. On the other hand the extra\ndimensions here may be small or large. Moreover the extra dimensions in the inflationary\nera may be larger or smaller than their present values. For example a term of k0 t in the\nargument of the conformal term cosu may break the symmetry thus induce a cosmological\nconstant. The induced cosmological term would depend on the phase factor k0 t hence it\nmay be different at different times independent of the size of the extra dimensions. Another\npoint which needs further study is the source of this symmetry and its breaking mechanisms\nboth in a physical and a mathematical content. I hope the investigation of all these and\nother interesting unanticipated aspects of this symmetry give fruitful results.\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Prof. Durmu\u015f Ali Demir for reading the manuscript and fruitful\ndiscussions on the topic and for his valuable comments.\n\n[1] N.
