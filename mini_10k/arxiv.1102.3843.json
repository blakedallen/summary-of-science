We focus on the phase ordering dynamics subsequent to a\ntemperature quench from the massless quark phase to the massive quark phase. We\nstudy the dynamics by considering a phenomenological model (Ginzburg-Landau\nfree-energy functional). The morphology of the ordering system is characterized by\nthe scaling of the order-parameter correlation function.\n\nHeavy-ion collision experiments at high energies produce hot and dense stronglyinteracting matter and provide the opportunity to explore the phase diagram of QCD [1].\nIt is worthwhile to stress that, in a phase transition process, information about which equilibrium phase has lowest free energy is not sufficient to discuss all possible structures that\nthe system can have. One has to understand the kinetics of the process by which the phase\nordering or disordering proceeds and the nature of nonequilibrium structures that the system must go through on its way to reach equilibrium [2, 3]. In the present work, we study\nkinetics of chiral transitions in hot and dense matter [4].\nWe use the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to study the chiral symmetry\nbreaking in QCD [5]. The expression for the thermodynamic potential is obtained in the\nmean-field approximation:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015o\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\nn \u0014\n12\n\u2212\u03b2 ( k 2 +M 2 \u2212\u03bc)\n\u2212\u03b2 ( k 2 +M 2 +\u03bc)\n~\ndk ln 1 + e\n\u03a9\u0303(M, \u03b2, \u03bc) = \u2212\n+ ln 1 + e\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b2\n\u0012q\n\u0013\nZ\n2\n12\n~k\n~k 2 + M 2 \u2212 |~k| + M .\nd\n(1)\n\u2212\n(2\u03c0)3\n4G\n\nHere, we have taken vanishing current quark mass, and introduce the constituent mass\nM = \u22122g\u03c1s with \u03c1s = h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i being the scalar density and g = G[1 + 1/(4Nc )]. The details\nof the mean-field approximation are reported elsewhere [6].\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: hm@prl.res.in\n\n\f2\nThe phase diagram resulting from Eq. (1) is shown in Fig. 1(a). For the parameters of\nthe NJL model, we have taken the three-momentum cutoff \u039b = 653.30 MeV, and coupling\nG = 5.0163 \u00d7 10\u22126 MeV\u22122 [7]. With these parameters, the vacuum mass of quarks is\nM \u2243 312 MeV. At T = 0, a first-order transition takes place at \u03bc \u2243 326.321 MeV. For\n\u03bc = 0, a second-order transition takes place at T \u2243 190 MeV. The first-order line (I) meets\nthe second-order line (II) at the tricritical point (\u03bctcp , Ttcp ) \u2243 (282.58, 78) MeV.\nClose to the phase boundary, the potential in Eq. (1) may be expanded as a GinzburgLandau (GL) potential in the order parameter M:\nb\nd\na\n\u03a9\u0303 (M) = \u03a9\u0303 (0) + M 2 + M 4 + M 6 + O(M 8 ),\n2\n4\n6\n\n(2)\n\ncorrect upto logarithmic corrections [8]. In the following, we consider the expansion of\npotential \u03a9\u0303 (M) upto the M 6 -term. The first two coefficients in Eq. (2) can then be exactly\nobtained by comparison with Eq. (1) while the coefficients b and d are obtained by fitting\nthe GL potential with the potential Eq. (1) for a given T and \u03bc. For stability, we require\nd > 0.\nThe extrema of the potential in Eq. (2) are determined by the gap equation \u03a9\u0303\u2032 (M) = 0\n\u221a\nwith solution M = 0, and M\u00b12 = (\u2212b \u00b1 b2 \u2212 4ad)/(2d). For b > 0, the transition is\nsecond-order, with the stationary points M = 0 (for a > 0) or M = 0, \u00b1M+ (for a < 0).\nFor a < 0, the preferred equilibrium state is the one with massive quarks. For b < 0, the\nsolutions of the gap equation are as follows: (i) M = 0 for a > b2 /(4d), (ii) M = 0, \u00b1M+ ,\n\u00b1M\u2212 for b2 /(4d) > a > 0, and (iii) M = 0, \u00b1M+ for a < 0. A first-order transition takes\n\nplace at ac = 3b2 /(16d) with the order parameter jumping discontinuously from M = 0 to\nM = \u00b1M+ = \u00b1(3|b|/4d)1/2 .\nThe evolution of the system is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\n(TDGL) equation:\n\u03b4\u03a9 [M]\n\u2202\nM (~r, t) = \u2212\u0393\n+ \u03b8 (~r, t) ,\n\u2202t\n\u03b4M\n\n(3)\n\nwhich models the over-damped relaxational dynamics of M(~r, t) to the minimum of \u03a9 [M]\n[9].\n\nHere, \u0393 is the inverse damping coefficient, and \u03b8(~r, t) is the noise term satisfyD\n\nE\n\ning the fluctuation-dissipation relation: h\u03b8 (~r, t)i = 0 and \u03b8(r~\u2032 , t\u2032 )\u03b8(r~\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) = 2\u0393T \u03b4(r~\u2032 \u2212\nr~\u2032\u2032 )\u03b4 (t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032 ). We use the natural scales of order parameter, space and time to introduce\n\ndimensionless variables: M = M0 M \u2032 (M0 =\n\nq\n\n|a|/|b|); ~r = \u03be r~\u2032 (\u03be =\n\nq\n\nK/|a|); t = \u03c4 t\u2032\n\n[\u03c4 = (\u0393|a|)\u22121 ]; \u03b8 = (\u0393|a|3/2 T 1/2 /|b|1/2 ) \u03b8\u2032 . Dropping the primes, we obtain the dimensionless\n\n\f3\nTDGL equation:\n\u2202\nM (~r, t) = \u2212sgn (a) M \u2212 sgn (b) M 3 \u2212 \u03bbM 5 + \u22072 M + \u03b8 (~r, t) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bb = |a|d/b2 > 0.\nFirst, we study the ordering dynamics for b > 0 corresponding to a quenching through the\nsecond order transition. We solve Eq. (4) numerically using an Euler-discretization scheme\nwith an isotropic Laplacian implemented on a d=2 lattice of size N 2 (N = 4096), with\nperiodic boundary conditions in all directions. The details of the simulation can be found\nelsewhere [6]. In Fig. 2, we show the evolution of a disordered initial condition for Eq. (4)\nwith b > 0 and a < 0 \u2013 corresponding to a temperature quench through the second-order\nline (II) in Fig. 1(a). The initial state consists of small-amplitude thermal fluctuations about\nthe massless phase M = 0. The system rapidly evolves into domains of the massive phase\nwith M \u2243 M+ and M \u2243 \u2212M+ . The interfaces between these domains correspond to M = 0\n\u2013 their evolution is shown in the snapshots (frames at the top) of Fig. 2. The frames at the\nbottom show the order parameter variation of the snapshots at the top.\nThe domains have a characteristic length scale L(t), which grows with time. The growth\nprocess is analogous to coarsening in the TDGL equation with an M 4 -potential [2, 3]. The\norder-parameter correlation function C(r, t) shows dynamical scaling C(r, t) = f (r/L). The\n2\n\nscaling function f (x) = (2/\u03c0) sin\u22121 (e\u2212x ) has been calculated by Ohta et al. (OJK) [10] in\nthe context of an ordering ferromagnet. Further, the domain scale obeys the Allen-Cahn\n(AC) growth law, L(t) \u223c t1/2 [3]. The same growth law has also been obtained via a closed\ntime path formalism of relativistic finite-temperature field theory applied to the NJL model\n[11].\nNext, we consider the case with b < 0 . In this case, a first-order chiral transition occurs\nfor a < ac = 3b2 /(16d) (or \u03bb < \u03bbc = 3/16). For a < 0, the potential has a double-well\nstructure and the ordering dynamics is equivalent to M 4 -theory, i.e., the domain growth\nscenario is similar to Fig. 2. We focus on a quench from the disordered state (with M = 0)\nto 0 < a < ac or 0 < \u03bb < \u03bbc , corresponding to a quench between the first-order line (I) and\nS1 in Fig. 1(a) \u2013 the corresponding points are denoted by crosses. The massless state is now\na metastable state of the M 6 -potential. The chiral transition proceeds via the nucleation\nand growth of droplets of the preferred phase (M = \u00b1M+ ). The nucleation results from\nlarge fluctuations in the initial condition or thermal fluctuations during the evolution. In\n\n\f4\nFig. 3, we show the nucleation and growth process. At early times (t = 400), the system\nis primarily in the M = 0 phase with small droplets of the preferred phase. These droplets\ngrow in time and coalesce into domains.\nIn the late stages of growth, there is no memory of the nucleation dynamics which characterized growth during the early stages. Let us note that a large dissipation (i.e., \u0393\u22121 ) will\nmake the equilibration time larger. If this becomes larger than the life time of the fire ball\nin heavy ion collision, the system may linger in the symmetry restored phase longer even\nwhen the temperature has already decreased below Tc . This means the Tc calculated based\non equilibrium thermodynamic models could be higher than the value that shows up in the\nexperiments [4, 6].\nTo summarize: we have studied the kinetics of chiral phase transitions in QCD. In terms\nof the quark degrees of freedom, the phase diagram is obtained using the NJL model. An\nequivalent coarse-grained description is obtained from an M 6 -Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free\nenergy. The chiral kinetics is modeled via the TDGL equation, and we consider the overdamped case. We study the ordering dynamics resulting from a sudden temperature quench\nthrough the first-order (I) or second-order (II) transition lines in Figs. 1(a). For shallow\nquenches through II and deep quenches through I, the massless phase is spontaneously unstable and evolves to the massive phase via spinodal decomposition. For shallow quenches\nthrough I, the massless phase is metastable and the phase transition proceeds via the nucleation and growth of droplets of the massive phase. The merger of these droplets results in\nlate-stage domain growth analogous to that for the unstable case. In all cases, the asymptotic growth process exhibits dynamical scaling, and the growth law is L(t) \u223c t1/2 . Given the\ndynamical universality of the processes involved, our results are of much wider applicability\nthan the simple NJL Hamiltonian considered here.\n\n[1] B. Mohanty, Nucl. Phys.

The solid lines superposed on the potentials correspond to the\nGL potential in Eq. (2).\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 2: Interface evolution after temperature quench through second-order line (II) in Figs. 1(a). The\nsnapshots at the top show the interfaces (M = 0) at t = 200, 4000 (in units of \u03c4 ). They were obtained by\nnumerically solving Eq. (4) as described in the text with a < 0, b > 0, \u03bb = 0.14. The noise amplitude was\n\u01eb = 0.008. The frames at the bottom show the variation of the order parameter along the diagonal.\n\nFIG. 3: Interface evolution after temperature quench through first-order line (I) in Figs. 1(a). The snapshots\nat the top show the interfaces (M = 0) at t = 400, 4000. They were obtained by solving Eq. (4) with b < 0,\nac > a > 0 and \u03bb = 0.14. The frames at the bottom show the variation of the order parameter along the\ndiagonal. Notice that the metastable patches (M = 0) at t = 400 are absent at later times.\n\n\f"}
