It becomes energetically preferable to ordinary dislocation due to enhanced\nCoulomb interactions in the semiconducting regime. Generation of\nthese objects changes e.g. the narrow band noise frequency.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTopological defects in Electronic Crystals - solitons, phase slips (PS) and\ndislocation lines/loops (DLs) are ultimately necessary for the current conversion and depining processes, see collections [1, 2, 3]. Microscopically in\nCharge and Spin Density Waves (CDW, SDW, DW) the PS starts as a selftrapping of electrons into solitons with their subsequent aggregation (see\n[4, 5, 6] for review). Macroscopically the PS develops as the edge DL proliferating/expanding across the sample [8, 7].\nAn important feature of semiconducting quasi one-dimensional DWs is\nthe Coulomb hardening [9] of their compressibility when the normal carriers\nfreeze out at low temperature T . Then the energetics of DL [10], the accompanying electronic structure [11], etc. are determined by the Coulomb forces\nlimited by screening facilities of remnant free carriers.\nThe CDW/SDW are characterized by scalar/vector order parameters:\n\u03b7cdw \u223c cos[Qx + \u03c6], ~\u03b7sdw \u223c m\n~ cos[Qx + \u03c6] where m\n~ is the unit vector of the\nstaggered magnetization. Here we will show that SDWs allow for unusual \u03c0\nPSs forbidden in CDWs where only 2\u03c0 PSs are allowed. Namely in SDW\nconventional dislocations loose their priority in favor of special topological\nobjects: a half-integer dislocation combined with a semi-vortex of a staggered magnetization vector. Their possible manifestation may be found in\na Narrow band Noise (NBN) generation. The \u03c0- PSs reduce twice (down to\nits CDW value \u03a9/j = \u03c0) the universal ratio \u03a9/j of the fundamental NBN\n1\n\n\ffrequency \u03a9 to the mean sliding current j. The splitting of the normal 2\u03c0\n-dislocation to the \u03c0 ones in energetically favorable due to Coulomb interactions. The magnetic anisotropy confines half-integer DLs in pairs connected\nby a magnetic domain wall.\nBelow we first consider the energy of usual DLs in DWs. Then we turn to\nthe special case of SDW and discuss combined topological objects. Finally\nwe discuss various models for the NBN generation and consequences of the\nexistence of combined topological objects in SDW.\n\n2\n\nA single dislocation in semiconducting density wave.\n\nAny stationary configuration is determined by minimization of the energy\nfunctional\nW {\u03c6} =\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\n~ h\u0304vF\ndR\n\u2202\u03c6\n\uf8f0C 0\nk\ns 4\u03c0\n\u2202x\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ C\u22a5 (\u2207\u22a5 \u03c6)2 \uf8fb + WC\n\n(1)\n\n~ = (x, ~r) with x being\nHere vF is the Fermi velocity of the parent metal, R\n2\nthe chain direction, s = a\u22a5 is the area per chain.

Recall that \u03c1n \u2192 1 at T \u2192 Tc0 and \u03c1n \u223c exp(\u2212\u2206/T ) at low T\nbeing activated through the DW gap 2\u2206.

They may not be important yet only at shortest interchain distances\n\n2\n\n\fr < r0 , which are allowed only if r0 > a\u22a5 , where the usual elastic theory is applicable. Beyond this core but still within the screening distance\nr0 < r < rscr we can write the energy, collecting only the senior terms, as\nkk2\nh\u0304vF X\n2\nW {\u03c6} \u2248\n+ r0\u22122 2 , k\u22a5 \u226b rscr\n|\u03c6k |2 C\u22a5 k\u22a5\n4\u03c0\nk\u22a5\n#\n\n\"\n\n(3)\n\nThis expression describes a nonanalitic elastic theory with energy dependent\non ratio of gradients rather on their values. Finally at large distances r \u226b rscr\nwe have\nW {\u03c6} \u2248\n\nh\ni\nh\u0304vF X\n2\n, Ck = \u03c1c /\u03c1n , k\u22a5 \u226a rscr\n|\u03c6k |2 Ck kk2 + C\u22a5 k\u22a5\n4\u03c0\nq\n\n(4)\n\nThe effective elastic theory is restored but in stretched coordinates (x C\u22a5 \u03c1n /\u03c1c , r).\nWe summarize that the effective compressibility Ck hardens with r (starting\nfrom Ck0 at shortest interchain distances) as Ck \u223c r 2 /r02 beyond the screening\nlength of the parent metal r > r0 \u223c 1\u00c5, until it saturates at rscr at the value\nwhich grows activationally with T .\nConsider a D-loop of a radius R in the (y, z) plane embracing a number\nN = \u03c0R2 /s chains or a D-line stretched in z direction at a distance Y =\na\u22a5 N from its counterpart or from the surface. The DL is characterized\nby its energy W (N) and by the 'chemical potential' w = \u2202W/\u2202N which\ndetermines the mutual equilibrium among DLs and between them and pairs\nof normal electrons. The scale of the DL energy\nq per unit length is E0 /a\u22a5 .\nWithin the (effective) elastic theory it is E0 \u223c Ck C\u22a5 h\u0304vF /a\u22a5 where C\u22a5 is\na measure of the interchain coupling. For essentially quasi-1D systems like\ntypical CDWs, where the actual transition temperature Tc < Tc0 \u223c \u2206 (so\nthat in the ordered phase always \u03c1c \u2248 1) we have E0 \u223c Tc . For systems with\nwider interchain electronic bandwidth t\u22a5 > \u2206, which is typical for SDWs, the\nscale is \u1ebc0 \u223c \u03c1c t\u22a5 which can be larger than Tc \u2248 Tc0 . A characteristic feature\n\u22121\nof the nonscreened regime (3) is an optimal perpendicular scale L\u22a5 = k\u22a5\nat\n1/2\n\u22121\n2\nany given longitudinal scale Lk = kk : L\u22a5 \u223c Lk r0 C\u22a5 . Now multiplying the\n2\nenergy density \u223c C\u22a5 L\u22122\n\u22a5 by the characteristic volume Lk L\u22a5 we estimate the\n1/2 2\nenergy as a function of R = L\u22a5 as h\u0304vF C\u22a5 R /r0 = wC N with N = \u03c0R2 /r0\nand wC \u223c E00 a\u22a5 /r0 , E00 \u223c max[Tc , \u03c1c t\u22a5 ].\nFinally for\u221athe D-loop energy WD (N) one finds [10]:\n1.

At large distances the standard perimetric law is restored but with the greatly enhanced \u223c \u03c1\u22121/2\nmagnitude.\nn\nIn SDW the energy of a pure magnetic vortex loop W (m)\n~ is not affected\nby the Coulomb forces, so that its only scale is E0 . We have\nWm\n~ =\n~ {m}\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\ndxd~r \uf8f0\n\u2202m\nC\u0303k\ns\n\u2202x\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n~ \u22a5 m)\n+ C\u0303\u22a5 (\u2207\n~ 2\uf8fb ,\n\nWm\n~ (N) \u223c\n\n\u221a\n\nN ln N \u1ebc0\n\n(5)\nwhere C\u0303k , C\u0303\u22a5 are the elastic moduli related to the rotation of the staggered\nmagnetization unit vector m\n~ . They are similar to phase displacement moduli\ntaken without Coulomb interactions Ck0 , C\u22a5 , in (1). Hence for the VLs the\nregime 1. is applicable at all N.\nThe resulting \u03bcD of a single D-loop is drown schematically at Fig.1. Here\nthe dashed line corresponds to the magnetic vortex loop. The inner region\nof the solid line describes both the D-loop and the magnetic vortex.\n\n3\n\nHalf-integer dislocation combined with semivortex.\n\nIn SDWs the Coulomb enhancement of the dislocation energy plays a principal role to bring to life a special combined topological object. This is the\nhalf-integer dislocation accompanied by the 180o rotation O\u03c0 of the staggered\nmagnetization m.\n~ Indeed, the SDW order parameter ~\u03b7 = m\n~ cos(Qx + \u03c6) allows for the following three types of self-mapping ~\u03b7 \u2192 ~\u03b7 . (The mapping is\na general requirement of topological connectivity which selects the allowed\nconfigurations [12, 13].)\ni. normal dislocation: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c0, m\n~ \u2192 m;\n~\nii. normal m\n~ \u2013 vortex: m\n~ \u2192 O2\u03c0 m,\n~\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6;\niii. combined object : \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u03c0, m\n~ \u2192 O\u03c0 m\n~ = \u2212m.\n~\nIn the last case both the orientational factor m\n~ and the translational one\ncos(Qx + \u03c6) change the sign, but their product ~\u03b7 stays invariant. A necessity of semi-vortices in conventional antiferromagnets in presence of frozen-in\nhost lattice dislocations has been realized already in [14]. In the SDW the\nsemi-vortices become the objects of the lowest energy created in the course\nof PS process. Indeed only not far below Tc at \u03c1n \u223c 1 the elastic moduli\nrelated to the phase displacements and to magnetization rotations are of the\nsame order, hence all three objects have similar energies, WD \u223c Wm\n~ . With\nlowering T the energy of the object ii. is not affected (except for a universal\ndependence \u223c \u03c1c near Tc ) because charges are not perturbed so that Coulomb\nforces are not involved. For objects i. and iii. the major energy \u223c \u03c1\u22121/2\nis\nn\nassociated to distortions of \u03c6 so that the energy of m\n~ rotation in the case iii.\nmay be neglected. To compare main contributions to energies of objects i.\nand iii. we remind that at given N the DL energy depends on its winding\n4\n\n\fnumber \u03bd\u03c6 as WD \u223c E0 (\u03c1s /\u03c1n )\u03bd\u03c62 , where \u03bd\u03c6 = 1/2 for \u03c0-DL and \u03bd\u03c6 = 1 for\nthe 2\u03c0-DL. The energy of the magnetic vortex depends on the vorticity \u03bdm\n~\n2\nas Wm\n~ \u223c E0 \u03c1s \u03bdm\n~ . We must compare their energies at the given number of\naccumulated electrons 2N. For shortness consider only the largest (screened)\nsizes of DLs.\nFor the D-loop with the radius R and the D-line located at a distance Y\nfrom its (spatially image) counterpart we have correspondingly\nN \u223c \u03bdR2 ,\n\u03bcD \u223c \u2202(\u03bd\u03c62 R ln R)/\u2202(\u03bd\u03c6 R2 ) \u223c \u03bd\u03c63/2 /N 1/2\nN \u223c \u03bdY,\n\u03bcD \u223c \u2202(\u03bd\u03c62 ln Y )/\u2202(\u03bd\u03c6 Y ) \u223c \u03bd\u03c62 /N\nIn both cases the lowest energy per electron W is given by an object with\nsmallest \u03bd\u03c6 = 1/2 i.e. by the combined one, W = (WD + Wm\n~ )/2 \u223c WD /2.\nWe conclude that in SDW the normal dislocation must split into two objects\nof the combined topology with the repulsion between them. Apparently they\nwill have the same sign of the displacive half-integer winding numbers (the\ntotal charge 2eN must be preserved). But the half-integer spin rotation\nnumbers should have opposite signs (to avoid a divergence of the magnetic\nenergy). In Fig.2 we present the vector field of the local SDW magnetization\n~\u03b7 for a single \"chimera\". The chain axis is horizontal.\nChemical potential\n\nR\n\nFigure 1: The chemical potential w = \u2202W/\u2202N of the D-loop.\nDashed line corresponds to the\nmodel without Coulomb interactions and to the vortex loop.\n\nFigure 2: Vector-field ~\u03b7 for halfDL combined with semi-vortex.\nSolid lines indicate constant\nphases around the half-DL.\n\nConsider now effects of a spin anisotropy which have either spin-orbital\nor dipole-dipole origin. The \"easy plane\" case allows for a free rotation of\nspins, so it will not affect any of above conclusions. The same will hold in\ncase of a pure \"easy axis\" case but only at presence of magnetic field H > Hsf\nexceeding the spin-flop field Hsf \u223c 1T above which the spins will be tilted\nthus possessing a free rotation at the hard plane. But the known SDW\ncrystals have low symmetry, which originates the spin anisotropy in all three\n5\n\n\fdirections. Being small, the anisotropy will not affect the arrangement in a\nvicinity of the DL where the gradient and the Coulomb energies dominate.\nBut at large distances from the DL the free rotation of spins is prohibited.\nThe \u03c0-rotation of spins will be concentrated in space within the Ne\u00e9l domain\nwall. It will form a string (a plane in 3D) which confines the two combined\nobjects. Indeed at r < rscr the total energy gain with respect to the normal\nA\nDL is \u2212EC N/2 while the energy lost due to domain wall formation is Wm\n~ =\nA\nA\nw N, thus both having a similar N dependence. Usually w \u223c 1K/chain <\nEC and we have a constant repulsion between the two chimeras. But beyond\nthe screening volume r > \u221a\nrscr the total energy gain of two objects with respect\nto one DL is W = \u2212(E0 / \u03c1n ) ln N + w A N - the Coulomb energy slows down\nA\nwhile the Wm\nthere is an equilibrium distance\n~ keeps growing linearly. Hence\n\u221a\nbetween the chimeras Neq \u223c E0 /(w A \u03c1n ). The confined objects can be\nshown to split off along the interchain direction. Usually the spin anisotropy\nis noticeable only for one orientation and characterized by the spin-flop field\nHs\u2212f \u223c 1T . It would originate the string of the length \u223c 0.1\u03bcm . At higher\nmagnetic fields only a small in-plane anisotropy is left so that the string\nlength may reach the sample width which is typically \u223c 1\u03bcm .\n\n4\n\nCombined topological defects and the NBN\ngeneration.\n\nThe DWs generate the Narrow Band Noise which is a coherent periodic unharmonic signal with the fundamental frequency \u03a9 being proportional to the\nmean dc sliding current j with the universal ratio \u03a9/j [15]. In CDW ideally\n\u03a9/j = \u03c0 which corresponds to carrying of two electrons by displacing of\nthe CDW by its wave length \u03bb. In SDW the ratio has been accessed only\nindirectly [16, 17] with the different experiments being in favor of either the\n\u03a9/j = \u03c0 of the twice higher ratio \u03a9/j = 2\u03c0 . Surprisingly the origin of such\na bright effect as the NBN has not been identified yet with main pictures\ncompeting:\nThe Wash-Board Frequency (WBF) model suggests that the NBN is generated extrinsically while the DW modulated charge passes through the host\nlattice sites or its defects [18].\nThe Phase Slip Generation (PSG) model suggests that the NBN is generated\nby the phase discontinuities occurring near injecting contacts [8, 7]. Recall\nthat CDW and SDW order parameters are\n\u03b7cdw \u223c cos[Qx + \u03c6] and ~\u03b7sdw \u223c m\n~ cos[Qx + \u03c6]\nwhere m\n~ is the vector of the staggered magnetization. Importantly the oscillating densities are\n\u03c1cdw \u223c \u03b7cdw \u223c cos[Qx + \u03c6], but \u03c1sdw \u223c \u03b4(~\u03b7cdw )2 \u223c cos[2Qx + 2\u03c6]\n6\n\n\fSo the SDW charge modulation wave length is only half of the CDW one\n\u03bb = 2\u03c0/Q. Hence within the WBF model the NBN frequency \u03a9 is doubled:\nIn CDW \u03a9 = \u2212\u03c6\u0307 = \u03c0j while in SDW \u03a9 = \u22122\u03c6\u0307 = 2\u03c0j.\nAt first sight the observation of the twice different ratios is natural from\nthe point of view of the WBF model. Nevertheless the WBF model has\nan unresolved weaknesses. The original concept implied the interaction between the rigid DW and the regular host lattice \u223c cos(n\u03c6) where the commensurability index is typically n = 4 which would give an n- fold WBF\ncontrary to experiments. Nowadays a common belief is that the necessary\npotential Vimp \u223c cos \u03c6 is provided by the host impurities. But actually\nVimp \u223c cos(Qxi + \u03c6) so that the positionally random phase shifts \u223c Qxi\nwill prevent any coherence in linear response. (The mode locking (Shapiro\nsteps) is still possible as a second order nonlinear effect.) But for the linear\neffects the only possibility left is to suppose that the DW does not slide at\nthe sample surface so that the coupling \u223c cos(\u03c6bulk \u2212 \u03c6surf ace ) would provide\na necessary WBF.\nThe PSG model (see [7] and refs. in [11, 19]) is attractive because the PSs\nare ultimately necessary to provide the current conversion at the contacts. A\nweak point of the PSG model is to explain their regularity: e.g. only one DL\ncan flash across at a given time while the next DW is waiting for the next DW\nperiod to pass. The topological connectivity requires that after the phase slip\nor going around the dislocation the order parameter should be mapped onto\nitself. For crystals it means that exactly one lattice period enters or in terms\nof dislocation language one says that the dislocation Burgers vector coincides\nwith the lattice period, which is 2\u03c0 in x - direction in our case. Since the\nunit sells of the CDW and the SDW are the same (2 electrons) the \u03a9/j = \u03c0\nwould be the same, which contradicts to the latest experimental results [17].\nThis argument has been used to exclude the PSG mechanism in favor to\nthe WBF one. A generation of half-integer DLs resolves this contradiction\nby twice increase of \u03a9/j. These \"chimeras\" are energetically favorable at\nlow temperatures, when the number of free carriers is small. But near the\nSDW transition temperature the energies of a magnetic vortex and of a the\ndislocation are comparable. Then the possibility of usual DL to split into\ntwo combined objects depends on the material parameters. It means that for\nSDW near Tc the ratio \u03a9/j in not universal. For some materials it can be 2\u03c0\nin the whole temperature range if the splitting of dislocation is energetically\nfavorable already near Tc , for other materials the ratio \u03a9/j can change from\n\u03a9/j = \u03c0 at high temperatures to \u03a9/j = 2\u03c0 at low temperatures passing\nthrough the region of intermediate values when both simple dislocations and\n\"chimeras\" coexist. Notice also a necessity of studying the narrow sample\nwhich is indeed the case for molecular crystal with SDWs. Otherwise the\nstring length created by the spin anisotropy will be shorter than the sample\nwidth and the chimers will propagate in loosely bound pairs.\n\n7\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions.\n\nWe conclude that the sliding SDW should generate \"chimers\": the combined topological objects where the spin rotations are coupled to the DW\ndisplacements. They are stable by lowering the DL Coulomb energy. This\ncombination effectively reduces the SDW period allowing e.g. for the twice\nincrease in the NBN frequency, which is an important disputable question.\nThe interest in such unusual topological objects may go far beyond the NBN\ngeneration or the current conversion problem in SDWs. Actually the studies\non these complex patterns would correlate to current interest in formation of\ntopological objects from superfluid 3 He to the model of earlier Universe [20].\n\nReferences\n[1] Charge Density Waves in Solids, L.P.
