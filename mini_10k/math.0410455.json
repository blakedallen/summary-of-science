In\ntropical geometry, multiplication is replaced by addition and addition by minimum. See [14]\nor [10] for an introduction. A polynomial is said to vanish tropically if, among the values of its\nterms, the minimum is not unique. For example, xy+x+y tropically vanishes if x = y \u2264 x+y\nor x = x + y \u2264 y or y = x + y \u2264 x. One motivation for this definition is that this is the\nunion of the three sets x + y = min(x, y), x = min(x + y, y) and y = min(x, x + y) which can\nbe obtained by replacing multiplication by addition and addition by minimum in the various\nequations \u2212xy = x + y, \u2212x = xy + y and \u2212y = xy + x. Another justification for this process\nis that it replaces exact polynomial relations between variables by approximate relations\n1\n\n\fbetween the negatives of their logs. (We have \u2212 log(xy) = \u2212 log x \u2212 log y and \u2212 log(x + y) =\nmin(\u2212 log x, \u2212 log y) + O(1) for x and y > 0.) A third, most precise, justification is that if\nwe study power series solutions Xi (t) to a polynomial f then tropicalizing this polynomial\ngives the necessary and, it turns out (see [15], theorem 2.1) also sufficient relations between\nthe vanishing orders of the Xi (t). We will discuss this perspective further in section 4.\nThis purpose of this paper is to study the tropical analogues of the notion of linear spaces\nand Pl\u00fccker coordinates. One of the pleasures of this theory is that it can be set up in a\npurely combinatorial manner without reference to general tropical theory. However, doing\nso requires defining slightly more inclusive notions of tropical linear space than if the theory\nwere exactly set up to match the classical geometry. This is very similar to the situation of\nmatroid theory, where the definition of a matroid is simple and every operation that can be\nperformed with a vector arrangement has a corresponding operation for a general matroid.\nOn the other hand, characterizing those matroids that come from vector arrangements \u2013 the\nso-called realizable matroids \u2013 is very hard. Similarly, we will have a notion of realizable\ntropical linear space which will be associated to a linear space over a nonarchimedean field\nand most of our motivation will come from operations with linear spaces. Our approach,\nhowever, will be to first give purely combinatorial definitions and only then discuss the\nrelation to geometry.\nTropical linear spaces will be polyhedral complexes. Thus, we can ask about all of the\ninvariants associated to polyhedral complexes. Ardila and Klivans [1] have studied the link\nof a vertex in a tropical linear space and have shown it to be homeomorphic to the chain\ncomplex of the lattice of flats of a certain matroid and thus, ([17], sect. 7.6), homotopic to a\nwedge of spheres. The polytopes occuring in tropical linear spaces are Minkowski summands\nof permutahedra (proposition 2.6). The topology of tropical linear spaces is quite simple:\nthey are contractible (theorem 2.9). So we understand the local combinatorics and the local\nand global toplogy of tropical linear spaces.\nThe global combinatorics of tropical linear spaces, on the other hand, is quite intriguing.\nThere is a great deal of theoretical and some experimental evidence for the following:\nThe f -Vector Conjecture. The number of i-dimensional faces of a tropical d-plane\nin\n\u0001\n\u0001\nn\u22122i n\u2212i\u22121\nn\nn-space which become bounded after being mapped to R /(1, . . . , 1) is at most d\u2212i\n.\ni\u22121\n\nRemark 1.1. It would follow from the f -vector conjecture that the number of total idimensional\u0001faces of\u0001a tropical d-plane in n-space, without any boundedness condition, is at\n2n\u2212d\u22121\nmost n\u2212i\u22121\n. See proposition 2.11.\nd\u2212i\ni\u22121\nThe following is a summary of the rest of the paper.\nIn section 2, we will define the basic concepts mentioned in this introduction and prove\ntheir essential properties. We will also introduce an operation called dualization, which is\n2\n\n\fanalogous to the classical operation of taking the dual, or orthogonal complement, of a linear\nspace.\nIn the section 3, we will introduce an operation of transverse intersection that produces\nnew tropical linear spaces from old. We define a tropical linear space to be constructible if it\ncan be built from tropical hyperplanes (equivalently, from points) by successive dualization\nand transverse intersection. Much of the rest of the paper will be devoted toward proving:\nTheorem 1.2. Every constructible space achieves the f -vector of the f -vector conjecture.\nIn section 4, we pause to explain how tropical linear spaces are related to linear spaces\nover power series fields, just as matroids are related to linear spaces over ordinary fields.\nThese section includes many counter-examples to show that tropical linear spaces can fail to\nbe realizable in almost every concievable way.\nIn section 5 we will define a notion of \"series-parallel tropical linear space\", analagous to\nthe notion of series-parallel matroid. We also describe a way of working with series-parallel\nmatroids in terms of two-colored trees that will be important in the future. One of our\nthemes will be that series-parallel tropical linear spaces are the best tropical linear spaces.\nIn particular we conjecture\nThe f -Vector Conjecture, Continued. Equality in the f -vector conjecture is achieved\nprecisely by series-parallel linear spaces.\nWe prove\nTheorem 1.3. Every constructible space is series-parallel.\nOne unfortunate consequence of theorem 1.3 is that it is quite hard to find a general\nmethod for writing down tropical linear spaces that are not series-parallel! More precisely,\nit is not so hard to produce degenerate limits of series-parallel linear spaces which are not\nthemselves series-parallel. Writing down a large number of tropical linear spaces which are\nnot limits of series-parallel tropical linear spaces, however, is a challenge \u2013 which is one of\nthe reasons that experimentally testing the f -vector conjecture is tricky.\nIn section 6, we will prove the f -vector conjecture in the cases i = 1 and d = n/2. We\nthen return to proving our main results. We prove theorem 1.3 in section 7 and also prove\nmany lemmas that will be used in the proof of theorem 1.2. We also prove theorem 1.2 in\nsection 7.\nFinally, in section 8, we will introduce a notion of tree linear space which achieves the\nbounds in the f -vector conjecture and has very explicit combinatorics. Suggestively, the\nconstruction of tree linear spaces will be reminiscent of the construction of cyclic polytopes.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nBasic Definitions and Results\n\nP\nFor f = e\u2208E fe X e a nonzero polynomial, E \u2282 Zn\u22650 , we denote by Trop(fP\n) the set of all\nn\npoints (x1 , . . . , xn ) in Rn such that, if we form the collection of numbers\ni=1 ei xi for e\nranging over E, then the minimum of this collection is not unique. Throughout the paper,\nwe will use X, P and occasionally Q to refer to variables in classical algebro-geometric\ncoordinates and x, p and q for the corresponding tropical variables.\nConsider a collection of variables pi1 ...id indexed by the d element subsets of [n] :=\n{1, . . . , n}. We will say that p is a tropical Pl\u00fccker vector if\n(pI ) \u2208 Trop(PSij PSkl \u2212 PSik PSjl + PSil PSjk )\nfor every S \u2208\n\n\u0001\n\n[n]\nd\u22122\n\nand every i, j, k and l distinct members of [n] \\ S.\n\nRemark 2.1. This definition is equivalent to saying that pI is a valuated matroid with\nvalues in the semiring (R, +, min). See [5] as well as the more general [6] and [7].\nLet \u2206(d, n) denote the (d, n)-hypersimplex, defined\nas the convex hull of the points\n\u0001\n[n]\nn\nei1 + * * * + eid \u2208 R where {i1 , . . . , id } runs over d . We abbreviate ei1 + * * * + eid by ei1 ...id .\nConsider a real-valued function {i1 , . . . , id } 7\u2192 pi1 ...id on the vertices of \u2206(d.n). We define a\npolyhedral subdivision Dp of \u2206(d, n) as follows: consider the points (ei1 + * * * + eid , pi1 ***id ) \u2208\n\u2206(d, n) \u00d7 R and take their convex hull. Take the lower faces (those whose outward normal\nvector have last component negative) and project them back down to \u2206(d, n), this gives\nus the subdivision Dp . We will often omit the subscript p when it is clear from context. A\nsubdivision which is obtained in this manner is called regular, see, for example, [18] definition\n5.3.\nLet P be a subpolytope \u0001of \u2206(d, n). We say that P is matroidal if the vertices of P ,\nconsidered as elements of [n]\nare the bases of a matroid M. In this case, we write P = PM .\nd\nOur references for matroid terminology and theory are Neil White's anthologies [16] and [17].\nProposition 2.2. The following are equivalent:\n1. pi1 ...id are tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates\n2. The one skeleta of D and \u2206(d, n) are the same.\n3. Every face of D is matroidal.\nProof. (1) =\u21d2 (2). Every edge of D joins two vertices of \u2206(d, n). If e is an edge of D\nconnecting eI and eJ , we define the length of e, l(e), to be |I \\ J| = |J \\ I|. Our claim is that\n4\n\n\fevery edge of e has length 1. We prove by induction on l \u2265 2 that D has no edge of length\nl.\n\u0001\n[n]\nFor the base case, if e is an edge with l(e) = 2 then e = (eSij , eSkl ) for some S \u2208 d\u22122\n.\nThe six vertices eSij , eSik , eSil , eSjk , eSjl , eSkl form the vertices of an octahedron O with\neSij and eSkl opposite vertices. One can check that the condition (pI ) \u2208 Trop(PSij PSkl \u2212\nPSik PSjl + PSil PSjk ) implies that O is either a face of D or subdivided in D into two square\npyramids (in one of three possible ways). In any of these cases, e is not an edge of D.\nNow consider the case where l > 2. Suppose (for contradiction) that e is an edge of D.\nLet e = (eST , eST \u2032 ), T \u2229 T \u2032 = \u2205, |T | = |T \u2032| = l. Let F be the face of \u2206(d, n) consisting of all\nvertices eI with S \u2282 I \u2282 S \u222a T \u222a T \u2032 . Then e must belong to some two dimensional face of\nD contained in F ; call this two dimensional face G.\nLet \u03b3 be the path from eST to eST \u2032 that goes around G the other way from e. No two\nvertices of F are more than distance l apart, so the edges of \u03b3 have lengths less than or\nequal to l. If \u03b3 contained an edge (eSU , eSU \u2032 ) of length l then its midpoint (eSU + eSU \u2032 )/2\nwould also be the midpoint of e contradicting the convexity of G. Thus, every edge of \u03b3\nhas length less than l and by induction must have length 1. So all the edges of \u03b3 are in the\ndirection ei \u2212 ej for some i and j \u2208 [n]. These vectors must span a two dimensional space.\nThis means either that there are {i1 , i2 , j1 , j2 } \u2282 [n] such that all edges of \u03b3 are parallel to\nsome eir \u2212 ejs or there are {i1 , i2 , i3 } \u2282 [n] such that every edge of \u03b3 is parallel to eir \u2212 eis .\nIn either case, e has length at most 2, but that returns us to our ground case.\n(2) =\u21d2 (3): Let P be any polytope in D. By assumption, all of the edges of P are edges\nof \u2206(d, n). It is a theorem of Gelfand, Goresky, MacPherson and Serganova ([9], theorem\n4.1) that this implies that P is matroidal. Since the proof is short, we include it. Let eI and\neJ be vertices of P with j \u2208 J \\ I. We must prove that there is a vertex of P of the form\neI\u222a{j}\\{b} for some b \u2208 I.\nP\nDefine a linear functional \u03c6 : \u2206(d, n) \u2192 R by \u03c6(x1 , . . . xn ) =\ni\u2208I xi + dxj . Then\nQ := P \u2229 {x : \u03c6(x) \u2265 d} is a convex polytope and hence connected. Q contains the vertices\neI and eJ and there is a path from eI to eJ along edges of P which lie in Q. Let the first\nstep of this path go from eI to eI\u222a{a}\\{b} . If a 6= j, \u03c6(eI\u222a{a}\\{b} ) = d \u2212 1 and eI\u222a{a}\\{b} does\nnot lie in Q. So instead we have a = j and we are done.\n(3) =\u21d2 (1): It is easy to check that, if (1) is false, D has a one dimensional face of the\nform Hull(eSij , eSkl ), with i, j, k and l distinct. This is not matroidal.\n[n]\n\nNow, suppose that (pI ) \u2208 R( d ) obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations. Define L(p) \u2282 Rn\nby\n\\\n\n1\u2264j1 <***<jd+1 \u2264n\n\nd+1\nX\nTrop( (\u22121)r Pj1 ***j\u02c6r ***jd+1 Xjr ).\nr=1\n\n5\n\n\fWe term any L which arises in this manner a d-dimensional tropical linear space in n-space.\nWe often omit the dependance on p when it is clear from context.\nL(p) is essentially the same set as the tight span of p defined in [8]. There are two\ndifferences: (1) Dress's sign conventions are opposite to ours and (2) L(p) is invariant under\ntranslation by (1, . . . , 1), Dress chooses a particular representative within each orbit for this\ntranslation.\nWhile the above definition makes the connection to ordinary linear spaces most clear, for\npractically every purpose it is better to work with the alternate characterization which we\nn\nnow give.\nPdFor any w \u2208 R , define Dw to be the subset of the vertices of \u2206(d, n) at which\npi1 ...id \u2212 j=1 wij is minimal. This is, by definition, a face of D and thus is PMw for a matroid\nMw .\nProposition 2.3. w \u2208 L(p) if and only if Mw is loop-free.\nRecall that a matroid is called loop-free if every element of the matroid appears in at least\none basis. There is a geometric way of recognizing when M is loop-free from the polytope\nPM : M is loop-free if and only if PM is not contained in any of the n facets of \u2206(d, n) of the\ntype xi = 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. In particular, note that if PM meets the interior of \u2206(d, n), M is\nnecessarily loop-free.\nP\nProof. By replacing pi1 ...id by pi1 ...id \u2212 dj=1 wij \u2212 (constant), we may assume without loss\nof generality that w = 0 and min pI = 0. Then Mw = M0 is simply the matroid whose\nbasis correspond to the I for which pI = 0. First, we assume that M0 has a loop j and\nprove that 0 6\u2208 L(p). Let (i1 , . . . , id ) be a basis of M0 , clearly j 6\u2208 (i1 , . . . , id ). Then\npi1 ...id = 0 but pji1 ...i\u02c6r ...id > 0 for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 d. Taking (j1 , . . . , jd+1 ) = (j, i1 , . . . , id ) we see that\nP\nr\n0 6\u2208 Trop( d+1\nr=1 (\u22121) pj1 ...j\u02c6r ...jd+1 xjr ).\nThe converse\nP {j1 , . . . , jd+1 }, our aim will be to prove\nPd+1 is rmore interesting. Fix J =\nejr and, for any s \u2208 R, set Ms = M\u2212seJ .\n0 \u2208 Trop( r=1 (\u22121) pj1 ...j\u02c6r ...jd+1 xjr ). Let eJ =\nNote that, for s large enough, all of the bases of Ms will be subsets of J. It is equivalent to\nshow that, for such an s, Ms has at least two bases or, equivalently, that for any j \u2208 J and\nany such s, j is not a loop of Ms . By hypothesis, j is not a loop of M0 , so it is enough to\nshow that if j \u2208 J is a loop of Ms for some s then it is a loop of Ms\u2032 for all s\u2032 < s.\nAs s varies, Ms changes at a finite number of values of s, call them s1 < s2 < * * * < sk .\nSuppose that si < s < si+1 , then PMs is a face of both PMsi and of PMsi+1 . The bases of Ms\nare precisely the bases of Msi which have the largest possible number of elements in common\nwith J. Similarly, the bases of Ms are precisely the bases of Msi+1 which have the smallest\npossible number of elements in common with J. In other words,\nMs = Msi |J \u2295 Msi /J = Msi+1 |[n]\\J \u2295 Msi+1 /([n] \\ J).\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: A Subdivision of \u2206(2, 4) and the Corresponding L/(1, 1, 1, 1)\nFrom the displayed equation, it follows that if j \u2208 J is a loop in Msi+1 then it is a loop in\nMs . Similarly, if j is a loop in Ms then it is a loop in Msi . Concatenating deductions of this\nsort, we see that, as promised, if j is a loop of Ms then it is a loop of Ms\u2032 for all s\u2032 < s.\nAs \u2206(d, n) is contained in the hyperplane x1 + * * * + xn = d we see L is invariant under\ntranslation by (1, 1, . . . , 1). We will abuse notation by saying a face of L is bounded if its\nimage in Rn /(1, . . . , 1) is bounded and calling a face a vertex if its image in Rn /(1, . . . , 1) is\nzero dimensional. However, when we refer to the dimensions of faces of L we will always be\nspeaking of L itself, without taking the quotient by (1, . . . , 1).\nWe see that L is a subcomplex of D \u2228 , where D \u2228 is defined to be the polyhedral subdivision\nof Rn where w and w \u2032 lie in the same face if Mw = Mw\u2032 . In figure 1, we show \u2206(2, 4), which\nis an octahedron, subdivided into two square pyramids and draw the dual L/(1, 1, 1, 1) in\nbold. We write M \u2228 for the face of D \u2228 dual to PM . If v = M \u2228 /(1, . . . , 1) is a vertex of\nL/(1, . . . , 1) we see that the link of L/(1, . . . , 1) at v is the subcomplex of the normal fan to\nPM consisting of the normals to the loop-free facets. This fan is studied in [1], we summarize\nthe main results of that paper in the following proposition:\nProposition 2.4. linkM \u2228 (L) is homeomorphic toLthe chain complex of the lattice of flats of\nL. If N \u2228 is a face of L containing v then N =\nFi+1 /Fi for some flag of flats \u2205 = F0 \u2282\nF1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fr = [n] of M.\nWhen M \u2228 /(1, . . . , 1) is positive dimensional, PM turns out to be a product of PN 's.\n\n7\n\n\fProposition 2.5. Let M Q\nbe a matroid with M =\nnected parts. Then PM = PMi .\n\nL\n\nMi the decomposition of M into con-\n\nProof. By the definition of direct sum, the bases of M are all combinations of bases of the\nMi .\nWe can now describe the faces of L. Recall that the braid arrangement Br is the fan\nin Rr whose facets are the cones of the type x\u03c3(1) \u2264 . . . \u2264 x\u03c3(r) where \u03c3 ranges over the\nsymmetric group Sr .\nProposition 2.6. If M \u2228 is an r-dimensional face of L then the normal fan to M \u2228 is a\nsubfan of a coarsening of Br . When M \u2228 is bounded, M \u2228 is a Minkowski summand of the r th\npermutahedron.\nProof. The normal fan to M \u2228 is the same as the link of PM in D. Let PM\u0303 be a face of D\nwith PM a face of PM\u0303 . We must show that the local cone of PM\u0303 at PM is a union of cones\nof Br . But the local cone of PM\u0303 at PM is precisely the negative of the cone of the normal\nfan to PM\u0303 dual to PM . From the description in [1], we see that the normal fan to PM\u0303 is a\ncoarsening of Bn and that the cones dual to codimension i faces are unions of cones of Br .\nIf M \u2228 is bounded then its normal fan is complete and thus, by the last paragraph, a\ncoarsening of Br . Br is the normal fan to the r th permutahedron. If P and Q are two\npolytopes such that the normal fan to Q refines that of P then P is a Minkowski summand\nof tQ for t sufficiently large.\n\nNot every coarsening of Br is the normal fan to a polytope. For example, take a cube,\ndivide one of its faces into two triangles and cone from the center. This is a coarsening of\nB4 which is not the normal fan of any polytope. I do not know whether there are further\nobstructions to a fan showing up as the normal fan to a face of a tropical linear space.\nProblem 2.7. Let P be a polytope whose normal fan is a coarsening of Br . Can P always\noccur as a face of a tropical linear space?\nFor ordinary linear spaces, the linear space determines the Pl\u00fccker coordinates up to\nscaling. For tropical linear spaces, a similar result holds.\nProposition 2.8. Let L be a tropical linear space with tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates pI . Then\nL determines the pI up to addition of a common scalar.\nProof. Let S be a d \u2212 1 element subset of [n] and let F denote the face of \u2206(d, n) whose\nvertices are those I containing S. Since F is an (n \u2212 d)-simplex, it can not be subdivided\nin D so F is a face of D. F corresponds to a loop-free matroid \u03a6 so it is dual to a face \u03a6\u2228\n8\n\n\fof L. \u03a6\u2228 is of the form (RS\u22650 + R(1, . . . , 1)) + q for q a vector satisfying qi = pSi for i 6\u2208 S.\nNo other face of L is of the form (RS\u22650 \u2295 R(1, . . . , 1)) + q and q is unique up to translation\nby (1, . . . , 1). Thus, L determines pSi \u2212 pSj . As this is true for all S, i and j, L determines\nthe pI up to adding the same constant to all of them.\nTheorem 2.9. L is a pure d-dimensional contractible polyhedral complex.\nProof. To show that L is pure d-dimensional, it is enough to show that the link of any vertex\nv of L/(1, . . . , 1) is a pure (d \u2212 2)-dimensional complex. Let v + (1, . . . , 1) be dual to PM\nfor some matroid M. By the results of [1], the link of v has a subdivision isomorphic to the\norder complex of the lattice of flats of M. This lattice is graded of length d, so its order\ncomplex is pure of dimension d \u2212 2.\nWe now show contractibility. It is easy to see that each tropical hyperplane is tropically\nconvex in the sense of [4]. Thus, their intersection is tropically convex and hence contractible.\nWe now study the bounded faces of L.\nProposition 2.10. The following are equivalent:\n1. w lies in a bounded face of L\n2. PMw is an interior face of D.\n3. Mw is loop-free and co-loop-free.\nProof. (2) \u21d0\u21d2 (3): PMw is interior if and only if it is not contained in any facet of \u2206(d, n).\nThe facets of \u2206(d, n) are of two types: xi = 1 and xi = 0. PMw lies in the former type if and\nonly if i is a co-loop of Mw ; PMw lies in the latter type if and only if i is a loop of Mw .\n(1) \u21d0\u21d2 (2): If P is not an interior face of D, the corresponding dual face is not bounded.\nConversely, if P is internal, the corresponding dual face of D \u2228 is bounded, so we just must\ncheck that this dual face is in L(p) at all. For this, we must check that Mw is loop-free. But\nwe saw in the previous paragraph that this follows from PMw being internal.\nAt this point, we can prove our earlier remark.\nProposition 2.11. \u0001If the f -vector\nconjecture is true then a tropical d-plane in n-space has\n\u0001\n2n\u2212d\u22121\nno more than n\u2212i\u22121\nfaces\nof dimension i.\nd\u2212i\ni\u22121\n\n9\n\n\fProof. Let D be a matroidal decomposition of \u2206(d, n), we must bound the number of codimension i \u2212 1 faces PM of D such that M has no loops. For such a PM , let \u039b \u2282 [n]\u0001 be the\nco-loops of M and let \u2206 be the face of \u2206(d, n) whose vertices are the sets I \u2208 [n]\nwhich\nd\ncontain \u2206. The claim that M has no loops is equivalent to saying that PM is an interior face\nof the decomposition\nof \u2206. So we may count the total number of PM by summing over \u2206.\n\u0001\nn\nThere are j faces \u2206 for which |\u039b| = j; each such \u2206 is isomorphic to \u2206(d \u2212 j, n \u2212 j). A\nsubpolytope of such a \u2206 has codimension i \u2212 1 in \u2206(d, n) if and only if it has co-dimension\ni \u2212 j \u2212 1 in \u2206. So, assuming\n\u0001 n\u2212d\u22121\u0001 the f -vector conjecture and writing the bound iun the f -vector\nconjecture as n\u2212i\u22121\n, we have the following bound for the number of co-dimension\nd\u2212i\ni\u22121\ni \u2212 1 loop-free faces of D:\nX \u0012n\u0013\u0012(n \u2212 j) \u2212 (i \u2212 j) \u2212 1\u0013\u0012(n \u2212 j) \u2212 (d \u2212 j) \u2212 1\u0013\nj\n\nj\n\n=\n(i \u2212 j) \u2212 1\n(d \u2212 j) \u2212 (i \u2212 j)\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nn \u2212 i \u2212 1 2n \u2212 d \u2212 1\nn\u2212i\u22121 X n n\u2212d\u22121\n.\n=\ni\u22121\nd\u2212i\ni\u2212j\u22121\nj\nd\u2212i\nj\n\n\u0001\nP \u0001 q \u0001\nThe last sum is evaluated by the identity j pj r\u2212j\n= p+q\n.\nr\n\u0001\n\u0001\n[n]\nSuppose that p : [n]\n\u2192 R obey the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations. Define p\u22a5 : n\u2212d\n\u2192 R by\nd\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\npI = p[n]\\I . Then the subdivision D of \u2206(n \u2212 d, n) induced by p is simply the image of D\nunder (x1 , . . . , xn ) 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 x1 , . . . , 1 \u2212 xn ). This map replaces each matroidal polytope with\nthe polytope of the dual matroid; in particular, p\u22a5 also obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations.\nWe denote L(p\u22a5 ) by L\u22a5 . We can easily check that L 7\u2192 L\u22a5 is an inclusion reversing\nbijection from the set of tropical linear spaces in Rn to itself.\nProposition 2.12. The bounded part of L\u22a5 is negative that of L. If L is a tropical linear space of dimension d in n space then the bounded part of L is at most min(d, n \u2212 d)dimensional.\nProof. The first sentence follows because the property of being loop- and co-loop-free is\nself dual. L is d-dimensional and L\u22a5 is (n \u2212 d)-dimensional; as the bounded part of L is\nisomorphic to a subcomplex of both it is at most min(d, n \u2212 d)-dimensional.\n\n3\n\nStable Intersections\n\nIf L and L\u2032 are two ordinary linear spaces of dimensions d and d\u2032 in n space which meet\ntransversely then L \u2229 L\u2032 is a (d + d\u2032 \u2212 n)-dimensional space whose Pl\u00fccker coordinates are\n10\n\n\fgiven by\nPJ (L \u2229 L\u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u00b1PI (L)PI \u2032 (L\u2032 ).\n\nI\u2229I \u2032 =J\n|I|=d\n|I \u2032 |=d\u2032\n\nNote that the summation conditions on I and I \u2032 guarantee that I \u222a I \u2032 = [n].\nWe will discuss a tropical version of this formula. If L and L\u2032 are tropical\n\u0001 linear spaces\n[n]\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof dimension d and d , define a real valued function p(L \u2229 L ) on d+d\u2032 \u2212n by\nstable\n\npJ (L \u2229 L\u2032 ) = min\n(pI (L) + pI \u2032 (L\u2032 )).\n\u2032\nstable\n\nI\u2229I =J\n|I|=d\n|I \u2032 |=d\u2032\n\nAt the moment, pJ (L \u2229 L\u2032 ) is just defined as a formal symbol, there is not yet any\nstable\n\ntropical linear space called L \u2229 L\u2032 . We now prove that there is such a space.\nstable\n\nProposition 3.1. p(L \u2229 L\u2032 ) is a tropical Pl\u00fccker vector.\nstable\n\nProof. Set P to be the polyhedron of points above the lower convex hull of the points\n(pi1 ...id (L), ei1 + * * * + eid ) \u2208 R \u00d7 \u2206(d, n) and define P \u2032 \u2282 R \u00d7 \u2206(d\u2032 , n) similarly. Include\n\u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) into the Minkowski sum \u2206(d, n) + \u2206(d\u2032 , n) by \u03b9 : e \u2192 e + (1, . . . , 1). Set\nQ = (P + P \u2032) \u2229 (R \u00d7 \u03b9(\u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n))). Then projecting the bottom faces of Q back down\nto \u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) yields the regular subdivision of \u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) induced by p(L \u2229 L\u2032 ).\nSo we see that every face of Dp(L\n\n\u2229 L\u2032 )\n\nstable\n\nis of the form\n\nstable\n\nR := \u03b9(\u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n)) \u2229 (PM + PM \u2032 ) .\nThe vertices of this face are the points \u03b9(eJ ) \u2208 \u03b9(\u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n)) where J = I \u2229 I \u2032 for I and\nI \u2032 bases of M and M \u2032 with I \u222a I \u2032 = [n].\nThere is an operation M \u2227 M \u2032 , called matroid intersection ([16], section 7.6), which takes\ntwo matroids of ranks d and d\u2032 and produces a third matroid. The spanning sets of M \u2227 M \u2032\nare precisely the sets of the form U \u2229U \u2032 where U and U \u2032 span M and M \u2032 respectively. M \u2227M \u2032\nalways has rank at least d + d\u2032 \u2212 n. If the rank of M \u2227 M \u2032 is larger than d + d\u2032 \u2212 n then there\nare no pairs of bases I and I \u2032 of M and M \u2032 with I \u222a I \u2032 = [n]. In this case R is empty and\ndoes not contribute a face to Dp(L \u2229 L\u2032 ) . Alternatively, the rank of M \u2227 M \u2032 is d + d\u2032 \u2212 n.\nstable\nThen we see that R = PM \u2227M \u2032 .\nWe have the immediate corollary\n11\n\n\fCorollary 3.2. Every face of Dp(L \u2229 L\u2032 ) is of the form PM \u2227M \u2032 for PM and PM \u2032 faces of\nstable\nDp(L) and Dp(L\u2032 ) .\nWe thus see that there is a well defined tropical linear space L \u2229 L\u2032 . Our aim now is\nstable\n\nto justify the notation L \u2229 L\u2032 by showing that L \u2229 L\u2032 is the \"stable\" intersection of L\nstable\n\nstable\n\nand L\u2032 . We first need a definition and a combinatorial lemma:\nM \u2032 be two loop-free matroids on [n] with connected decomposition M =\nL Let M and\nL\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni\u2208I Mi , M =\ni\u2208I \u2032 Mi . Let Si and Si be the ground sets of Mi and Mi . Let \u0393(M, M ) be\n\u2032\nthe bipartite graph (possibly with multiple edges) whose vertex set is I \u2294 I and which has\nan edge between I and I \u2032 for each element of Si \u2229 Si\u2032\u2032 . We say that M and M \u2032 are transverse\nif \u0393(M, M \u2032 ) is a forest without multiple edges.\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that M and M \u2032 are transverse and let \u0393 = \u0393(M, M \u2032 ). Then M \u2227 M \u2032\nis a loop-free matroid whose connected components are in bijection with the components of\n\u0393. M \u2227 M \u2032 is the matroid formed by repeatedly taking parallel connections along the edges\nof \u0393. M \u2227 M \u2032 has rank d + d\u2032 \u2212 n.\nThe phrase \"repeatedly taking parallel connections\" deserves a proper definition. What\nwe mean is the following: let F be a forest, let E be a finite set and let each edge of F be\nlabelled with an element of E, no two edges receiveing the same label. Suppose that, for\neach vertex v \u2208 F , we are given a subset S(v) of E. We require that S(v) \u2229 S(w) = {e}\nif\nS e is the edge (v, w), that S(v) \u2229 S(w) = \u2205 if there is no edge joining v and w and that\nv\u2208F S(v) = E. For every v \u2208 F , we place the structure of a connected loop-free matroid\nM(v) on S(v). We then define a matroid N on the ground set E by the following procedure:\n1. If F has no edges, let N =\n\nL\n\nv\u2208F\n\nM(v).\n\n2. Otherwise, let v and w be vertices of F joined by an edge e.\n3. Form a new forest F \u2032 where e is contracted to a single vertex u. Set S \u2032 (u) = S(v)\u222aS(w)\nand let M \u2032 (u) be the parallel connection of M(v) and M(w) along e. For all t \u2208 F\nother than u, set S \u2032 (t) = S(t) and M \u2032 (t) = M(t).\n4. Return to step (1) with the new forest F \u2032 and the new S \u2032 (*) and M \u2032 (*).\nThe claim is that N does not depend on the order of the contractions and, that when\nwe use F = \u0393, S(i) = Si or Si\u2032 , for i \u2208 I or I \u2032 and M(i) = Mi or Mi\u2032 for i \u2208 I or I \u2032 then\nN = M \u2227 M \u2032.\n\n12\n\n\fProof. Let T , S(\u2022) and M(\u2022) be as above and let N(F, S(*), M(*)) be the a matroid constructed by the above procedure. We claim that U \u2282 E is a basis of N(F, S(\u2022), M(\u2022)) if\nand only if there exist bases B(v) of M(v) such that, for every e \u2208 E, precisely one of the\nfollowing four conditions holds:\n1. e \u2208 U, e = (v, w) is an edge of F and e \u2208 B(v) \u2229 B(w).\n2. e \u2208 U, e \u2208 S(v) is not an edge of F and e \u2208 B(v).\n3. e 6\u2208 U, e = (v, w) is an edge of F and e lies in precisely one of B(v) and B(w).\n4. e 6\u2208 U, e \u2208 S(v) is not an edge of F and e 6\u2208 B(v)\nThis is the definition of direct sum when F has no edges and it is easy to check that this\ndescription is unchanged by contracting an edge. Note that this description is independent\nof the order of contractions, so we see that N(T, S(\u2022), M(\u2022)) is independent of the order of\ncontraction.\nApplying the above description in the case where F = \u0393(M, M \u2032 ) etc., we see that the\nbases of N(\u0393, M\u2022 , S\u2022 ) are precisely the sets of the form B \u2229B \u2032 where B and B \u2032 are bases of M\nand M \u2032 with B \u222a B \u2032 = [n]. These are precisely the bases of M \u2227 M \u2032 providing that some such\n(B, B \u2032 ) exist. But the iterative construction above clearly does produce a matroid and every\nmatroid has at least one basis, so such B and B \u2032 do exist. |B \u2229 B \u2032 | = |B| \u222a |B \u2032 | \u2212 |B \u222a B \u2032 |\nso N has rank d + d\u2032 \u2212 n. Fianlly, observe that parallel connections preserves loop-freeness,\nso N is loop-free.\nProposition 3.4. Let 0 \u2264 d, d\u2032 \u2264 n with d + d\u2032 \u2265 n. Suppose that L and L\u2032 are tropical\nlinear spaces in n-space of dimension d and d\u2032 . Then L \u2229 L\u2032 \u2286 L \u2229 L\u2032 . If L and L\u2032 meet\nstable\n\ntransversely then L \u2229 L\u2032 = L \u2229 L\u2032 .\nstable\n\nProof. Let D, D \u2032 and E be the subdivisions of \u2206(d, n), \u2206(d\u2032 , n) and \u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) corresponding to L, L\u2032 and L \u2229 L\u2032 . Let D \u2228 , (D \u2032 )\u2228 and E \u2228 denote the dual subdivisions of\nstable\n\nRn .\nConsider a particular w \u2208 Rn , we need to show that w \u2208 L \u2229 L\u2032 implies that w \u2208 L\nstable\n\nand w \u2208 L\u2032 and that the reverse holds if L and L\u2032 meet transversely. Let M \u2228 , (M \u2032 )\u2228 and N \u2228\nbe the faces of D \u2228 , (D \u2032 )\u2228 and E \u2228 respectively containing w and let PM , PM \u2032 and PN be the\nrespective dual faces of D, D \u2032 and E. Then PN = (PM + PM \u2032 ) \u2229 \u03b9(\u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n)). We must\nshow that, if M or M \u2032 has a loop then N has a loop and that, if L and L\u2032 meet transversely\nand N has a loop then M or M \u2032 does as well.\n\n13\n\n\fFirst, suppose that M contains a loop e. Then, for every x \u2208 PM , xe = 0. For every\nx \u2208 PM \u2032 , 0 \u2264 xe \u2264 1. Thus, for x \u2208 PM + PM \u2032 , 0 \u2264 xe \u2264 1 and thus xe = 0 on PN . So e is a\nloop of N.\nL\nL\nNow assume that L and L\u2032 meet transversely. Let M = i\u2208I Mi and M \u2032 = i\u2208I \u2032 Mi\u2032 be\nthe components of M and M \u2032 and let Si and Si\u2032 be the ground sets of Mi and Mi\u2032 respectively.\n\nLemma 3.5. M and M \u2032 are transverse, i.e., \u0393(M, M \u2032 ) is a forest and has no multiple edges.\n\nProof. Let |I| = e and |I \u2032 | = e\u2032 , so e and e\u2032 are the dimensions of M \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 . The affine\nlinear space spanned by M \u2228 is cut out by the equations xi \u2212 xj = constant when edges i and\nj have the same endpoint in I, and similarly for (M \u2032 )\u2228 . Thus, M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 spans the affine\nlinear space cut out by the equations xi \u2212 xj = constant whenever edges i and j are in the\nsame component of \u0393. We assumed that L and L\u2032 meet transversely, so the dimension of\nthe last linear space must be e + e\u2032 \u2212 n and \u0393 must have e + e\u2032 \u2212 n connected components.\nA graph with e + e\u2032 vertices, n edges and e + e\u2032 \u2212 n connected components must be a forest\nwithout multiple edges.\nWe now know by lemma 3.3 that M \u2227 M \u2032 is loop-free.\nThe next theorem explains the motivation for the notation L \u2229 L\u2032 and the geometric\nmeaning of L \u2229 L\u2032 when L and L\u2032 are not trasnverse.\n\nstable\n\nstable\n\nTheorem 3.6. Let L and L\u2032 be tropical linear spaces. Then, for a generic v \u2208 Rn , L and\nL\u2032 + v meet transversely. L \u2229 L\u2032 = limv\u21920 (L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v)).\nstable\n\nProof. Let F and F \u2032 be faces of L and L\u2032 . Suppose that the affine linear spaces spanned by F\nand F \u2032 together fail to span Rn . Then, for v outside a proper subspace of Rn , F \u2229(F \u2032 +v) = \u2205.\nThus, for a generically chosen v, every such F and F \u2032 + v fail to meet. The only faces of L\nand L\u2032 + v that do meet, then, meet P\ntransversely.\nWe have pI (L\u2032 + v) = pI (L\u2032 ) + i\u2208I vi so the tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates of L\u2032 + v\nvary continuously with v. The tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates of L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v) similarly\nstable\n\nvary continuously with v. When v is chosen generically, L and L\u2032 + v meet transversely so\nL \u2229 (L\u2032 + v) = L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v). Take limits of both sides as v \u2192 0 and use the proceeding\nstable\n\ncontinuity arguments to conclude that limv\u21920 (L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v)) = L \u2229 L\u2032 .\nstable\n\n14\n\n\f4\n\nLinear Spaces over Power Series Fields\n\nLet \u03ba be an algebraically closed field and let K be an algebraic closure of \u03ba((t)). With some\ncare as to our language, all of our results can be generalized to a general algebraically closed\nfield complete with respect to a nontrivial archimedean valuation but we will stick to this\ncase for simplicity. There is a unique valuation v : K \u2217 \u2192 R extending v(at\u03b1 + * * * ) = \u03b1.\nLet R be the ring {0} \u222a v \u22121 (R\u22650 ) and M the ideal {0} \u222a v \u22121 (R>0 ) so R/M = \u03ba. If X is a\nsubvariety of K n , we define Trop X to be the closure in Rn of v(X \u2229 (K \u2217 )n ). We also, when\nit is more convenient, write Trop I where I is the ideal of X.\nLet f \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a nonzero polynomial and let w \u2208 Rn . We define\nP a polynomial\nInw f \u2208 \u03ba[x1 , . . . , xn ] as follows: expand f (tw1 x1 , . . . , txn xn ) as a power series t\u03b1i fi (x1 , . . . , xn )\nwhere fi \u2208 \u03ba[x1 , . . . , xn ] \\ {0} and \u03b1i is increasing. Then Inw f = f0 . If I \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] is\nan ideal, we define Inw I to be the ideal generated by Inw f for f \u2208 I. Similarly, if X \u2282 K n\nis a variety with ideal I, we denote Spec(\u03ba[x]/ Inw I) as Inw X.\nIf w \u2208 Trop I and f \u2208 I \\ {0} then Inw f is clearly not a monomial. It turns out that the\nconverse is true as well.\nTheorem 4.1. Trop I is the set of w for which Inw I contains no monomial.\nProof. See [15], theorem 2.1.\nWe earlier defined Trop f for f a polynomial and have just now given a definition of\nTrop(f ) for (f ) a principal ideal. For f \u2208 \u03ba[x], these two definitions are consistent.\nNow consider the case where L is a linear space with Pl\u00fccker coordinates Pi1 ...id . Let\npi1 ...id = v(Pi1 ...id ). The P 's obey the Pl\u00fccker relations, so the p's obey the tropical Pl\u00fccker\nrelations. Our next proposition shows that the combinatorially defined L(p) truly does reflect\nthe geometrically defined Trop L.\nProposition 4.2. Trop L = L(p).\nP\nProof. Every point (x1 , . . . , xn ) in L obeys (\u22121)r Pj1 ...bjr ...jd+1 Xjr = 0 so the v(Xi ) lie in\nP\nr\nTrop( d+1\nr=1 (\u22121) Pj1 ***j\u02c6r ***jd+1 Xjr ). Thus, Trop L \u2286 L(p).\nFor the converse direction, suppose w \u2208 L(p), we will prove that w \u2208 Trop L. Without\nloss of generality, let w = 0 and suppose that 0 = minI\u2208([n]) pI . Let PI (0) \u2208 \u03ba be the image\nd\n\nof PI in \u03ba = R/M. Clearly, the PI (0) obey the Pl\u00fccker relations and hence correspond to an\nideal L(0) \u2282 \u03ban . It is easy to see that L(0) = Inw L. Let M be the set of I for which pI = 0,\nby assumption M is the set of bases of a loop free matroid. So L(0) is not contained in any\nof the coordinate planes of \u03ban and thus the corresponding ideal contains no monomial.\n\n15\n\n\fIt also turns out that\nintersection.\n\n\u2229\n\nstable\n\ndoes actually capture the behavior of linear spaces under\n\nProposition 4.3. Let L and L\u2032 \u2282 K n be two linear spaces. Then there exists a linear space\nL\u0303\u2032 \u2282 K n with Trop L\u0303\u2032 = Trop L\u2032 and Trop L \u2229 Trop L\u2032 = Trop L \u2229 Trop L\u0303\u2032 = Trop(L\u2229 L\u0303\u2032 ).\nstable\n\nstable\n\nIf Trop L and Trop L\u2032 meet transversely, then we already have Trop L \u2229 Trop L\u2032 = Trop(L\u2229\nstable\n\nL\u2032 ) without having to choose an L\u0303\u2032 .\nProof. Let d and d\u2032 be the dimensions of L and L\u2032 . Let PI , PI\u2032 and QI be the Pl\u00fccker\ncoordinates of L, L\u2032 and L \u2229 L\u2032 , so\nX\nQJ =\n\u00b1PI PI\u2032\u2032 .\nI\u2229I \u2032 =J\n|I|=d\n|I \u2032 |=d\u2032\n\nIf qI are the tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates of Trop L \u2229 Trop L\u2032 , we have\nstable\n\nqJ = min\nv(PI PI\u2032\u2032 ).\n\u2032\nI\u2229I =J\n|I|=d\n|I \u2032 |=d\u2032\n\nWe want P\nto have qJ = v(QJ ), so we will be successful if there is no cancellation of leading\nterms in\n\u00b1PI PI\u2032\u2032 .\nLet (u1 , . . . , un ) \u2208 (\u03ba\u2217 )n . Let L\u0303\u2032 = diag(u1 , . . . , un )L\u2032 . Letting P \u0303I\u2032 denote the Pl\u00fccker\nQ\ncoordinates of L\u0303\u2032 , we have P \u0303I\u2032 = PI\u2032 i\u2208I ui . When the ui are chosen generically, there is no\nP\nQ\nP\n\u00b1PI PI\u2032 i\u2208I \u2032 ui. For a generic u,\ncancellation of leading terms in the sum\n\u00b1PI P \u0303I\u2032\u2032 =\ntherefore, L\u0303\u2032 has the desired property.\nWe now must prove the second claim, that if Trop L and Trop L\u2032 meet transversely then\nwe never have cancellation in this sum. We will do this by showing that one term has a\nlower valuation than all of the others. Let E be the subdivision of \u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) induced\nby q and let D and D \u2032 be the subdivisions of \u2206(d, n) and \u2206(d\u2032 , n) corresponding to Trop L\nand Trop L\u2032 . Let PN be a facet of E containing the vertex J and let w \u2208 N \u2228 . Let M \u2228 and\n(M \u2032 )\u2228 be the faces of D \u2228 and (D \u2032)\u2228 containing w. Without loss of generality, we can take\nw = 0 and\n= min p\u2032I .\nL 0 = min pI L\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLet\ni\u2208I Mi and\ni\u2208I \u2032 Mi be the connected components of M and M . Write \u0393 =\n\u2032\n\u0393(M, M ). As in lemma 3.5, we see that \u0393 is a forest. The fact that J is a basis of N\nindicates that there are B and B \u2032 with B \u2229 B \u2032 = J, B \u222a B \u2032 = [n] such that, for each Mi ,\nB \u2229 Mi a basis of Mi and similarly for B \u2032 . If we show there is only one such pair (B, B \u2032 ),\n16\n\n\fthat will indicate that there is only one term in the sum with valuation zero and hence no\ncancellation.\nSuppose there were two such pairs, (B1 , B1\u2032 ) and (B2 , B2\u2032 ). For e \u2208 [n] and S \u2282 [n], define\n[e \u2208 S] to be 1 if e \u2208 S and 0 otherwise. Note that [e \u2208 Bs ] + [e \u2208 Bs\u2032 ] = 1 + [e \u2208 J]. Set\n\u03b1(e) = [e \u2208 B1 ] \u2212 [e \u2208 B1\u2032 ] \u2212 [e \u2208 B2 ] + [e \u2208 B2\u2032 ]\n= 2 ([e \u2208 B1 ] \u2212 [e \u2208 B2 ]) .\nwe think of \u03b1 as a cochain in C 1 (\u0393). We have\nX\n\u2202\u03b1(Mi ) = 2\n([e \u2208 B1 ] \u2212 [e \u2208 B2 ])\ne\u2208Mi\n\n= 2(|B1 \u2229 Mi | \u2212 |B2 \u2229 Mi |).\n\nSince B1 \u2229Mi and B2 \u2229Mi are both bases of Mi they have the same cardinality and \u2202\u03b1(Mi ) = 0\nfor every Mi . Similarly, \u2202\u03b1(Mi\u2032 ) = 0. So \u03b1 is a cochain. But \u0393 is acyclic, so \u03b1 = 0. This in\nturn implies that [e \u2208 B1 ] = [e \u2208 B2 ] for every e \u2208 [n] so B1 = B2 and similarly B1\u2032 = B2\u2032 .\nHaving seen that every linear space over K gives rise to a tropical linear space, one might\nask whether every tropical linear space arises in this manner. The answer to this question\nis a dramatic \"no\" and we conclude this section by showing various manners in which this\ncan fail. We will say that a tropical linear space is realizable if it arises from a linear space\nover K.\nFirst, D can contain polytopes corresponding to non-realizable matroids; such a polytope\nobviously can not occur in a realizable decomposition. For example, if M is the non-Pappus\nmatroid, removing PM from \u2206(3, 9) leaves 8 matroidal polytopes, each of them a cone on\n\u22062 \u00d7 \u22065 . Cutting \u2206(3, 9) into the non-Pappus matroid and the eight other pieces gives a\nnon-realizable matroidal subdivision. More generally, any matroid at all may appear as a\npiece of a matroidal subdivision:\n\u0001\nProposition 4.4. If M is a rank d matroid on n elements, the function \u2212\u03c1(*) on [n]\nobeys\nd\nthe tropical Pl\u00fccker relations, where \u03c1(S) is the rank of the flat spanned by S for any S \u2282 [n].\nM is a face of the corresponding subdivision.\n\u0001\n[n]\nProof. Let S \u2208 d\u22122\nand let i, j, k and l be distinct elements of [n] \\ S. Write \u03c1M/S for the\nrank function of M/S, we have \u03c1(Sij) = \u03c1M/S (ij) + \u03c1(S). Thus, we only need to check that\n\u2212\u03c1 obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations in the case where d = 2 and n = 4, which is straight\nforward. M is a face of the corresponding subdivision because \u2212\u03c1 is minimal on the vertices\nof M.\n17\n\n\f1\n1,2,3,4\n\n2\n\n9\n10\n\n3\n4\n\n11\n5\n\n6 7\n\n8\n\n9101112\n\n5\n\nM1\n\n76\n\n12\n8\n\nM2\nFigure 2: The Matroids M1 and M2\n\nEven if every face of D is realizable, it is still possible for the subdivision to be nonrealizable for global reasons. Suppose \u03ba does not have characteristic 2 or 3. Let M1 and M2\nbe the rank 3 matroids on 12 points corresponding to the plane geometries in figure 2. After\nremoving M1 and M2 from \u2206(3, 12), the remainder can be cut into cones on \u22062 \u00d7 \u22068 . This\ngives a matroidal subdivision into realizable matroids. This subdivision is not realizable; if\npijk \u2208 K where the Pl\u00fccker coordinates of a linear space over K realizing this subdivision then\nthe presence of M1 implies that p156 p178 = p167 p158 (1 + higher order terms). The presence of\nM2 implies that p156 p178 = p167 p158 (\u22122 + higher order terms), a contradiction.\nIt is possible to have a matroidal subdivision that is not regular and hence certainly can\nnot be realizable. Map \u2206(6, 12) to Z3 /(1, 1, 1) by (x1 , . . . , x12 ) \u2192 (x1 + . . . + x4 , x5 + . . . +\nx8 , x9 + . . . + x12 ). Subdivide \u2206(6, 12) according to the preimage of figure 3. The resulting\nsubdivision is not regular because figure 3 is not.\nIt is possible for a matroidal subdivision to be induced by two different p's such that one\nof the p's is realizable and the other is not. We give an example when K has characteristic\n2, but there are characteristic zero examples. Let F denote the Fano plane (see figure\u0001 4),\nand let D be the subdivision of \u2206(3, 7) into PF and 7 cones on \u22062 \u00d7 \u22063 . Let C \u2282 [7]\nbe\n3\nthe triples of dependent elements of F . Let p be a collection of tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates\ninducing D. We can assume without loss of generality that p is 0 on PF . Then p induces D\nwhenever pI > 0 for I \u2208 C.\n18\n\n\f(2,0,4)\n\n(0,2,4)\n\n(4,0,2)\n\n(4,2,0)\n\n(0,4,2)\n\n(2,4,0)\n\nFigure 3: A non-regular subdivsion that induces a non-regular subdivision of \u2206(6, 12).\n\n1\n\n4\n\n7\n6\n\n2\n\n5\nFigure 4: The Fano Plane\n\n19\n\n3\n\n\fIn characteristic 2, the following relation holds among the Pl\u00fccker coordinates:\n0 = \u2212 P367 P567 P124 \u2212 P167 P467 P235 \u2212 P127 P567 P346\n\u2212P126 P367 P457 \u2212 P237 P467 P156 + P134 P567 P267 + P246 P567 P137 + P136 P267 P457 .\nHere the underlined variables are those corresponding to the elements of C. We see that,\nwith our asssumption that p is zero on PF and in particular on all vertices outside C, the\nvaluations of the various terms are pI as I runs over C and also p267 + p457 . As p457 > 0,\nthis last can't be minimal. We see that the p\u2032 s must obey the relation that the minimum of\npI for I \u2208 C is not unique in order to be realizable. (In face, this condition is sufficient for\nrealizability as well.)\nWe end by discussing two naturally occuring examples of tropical Pl\u00fccker coordinates for\nwhich I do not know whether or not the corresponding linear space is realizable.\nProblem 4.5. Let T be a tree with leaves labelled by [n] and a positive weight on each\nedge. For I \u2282 [n], define [I] to be the minimal subtree of T containing I and set pI to be\nnegative the sum of the weights of all edges in [I]. It is shown in [13] that pI are tropical\nPl\u00fccker coordinates, are they realizable?\nProblem 4.6. Let R = R((t)), R is an ordered field where at\u03b1 + * * * is positive if and only\nif a is. Thus, it makes sense to define a d \u00d7 d matrix A with entries in R to be positive\ndefinite if vAv T > 0 for all v \u2208 Rd \\ {0}. Let X1 , . . . , Xn be d \u00d7 d positive definite symmetric\nP\nmatrices with entries in R. Set Pi1 ...id equal to the coefficient of xi1 * * * xid in det xi Xi .\nThe PI do not obey the Pl\u00fccker relations. Nonetheless, it is shown in [12] that v(PI ) do obey\nthe tropical Pl\u00fccker relations! Are the v(Pi ) realizable? If so, give a natural linear space\nover R, constructed from the Xi , that realizes them.\n\n5\n\nSeries-Parallel Matroids and Linear Spaces\n\nRecall that if G is a connected graph (finite, possibly with multiple edges or loops) then the\nassociated graphical matroid is a matroid whose elements are the edges of G, whose bases\nare the spanning trees and whose circuits are the circuits. See [16], section 6.1. The rank\nof this matroid is the number of vertices of G minus one. A matroid is called series-parallel\nif it corresponds to a series-parallel graph, i.e. a graph which can made by starting from\na single edge connecting two distinct vertices by repeatedly applying the series and parallel\nextension operators. (See figure 5.) For a general introduction to series-parallel matroids,\nsee Section 6.4 of [16].\nWe will call a matroidal decomposition D of \u2206(s, n) a series-parallel decomposition if\nevery facet of D is the polytope of a series-parallel matroid and the associated tropical linear\n20\n\n\fSeries Extension\n\nParallel Extension\n\nFigure 5: Series and Parallel Extension\nspace will be called a series-parallel tropical linear space. We will see that series-parallel\nlinear spaces are the most natural and most manageable tropical linear spaces.\nRecall that one of our main aims is to prove.\nThe f -Vector\nEvery d-dimensional tropical linear space L in n-space has\n\u0001 Conjecture.\n\u0001\nn\u22122i n\u2212i\u22121\nat most d\u2212i\nbounded faces of dimension i, with equality if and only if L is series\ni\u22121\nparallel.\nWe spend the rest of this section presenting what appears to be a new way of treating\nseries-parallel matroids, these methods will be applied in sections 7 and 8.\nLet T be a trivalent tree (i.e. every internal vertex of T has three neighbors) with n\nleaves whose n \u2212 2 internal vertices are colored white and black with d \u2212 1 black vertices and\nn \u2212 d \u2212 1 white vertices. For every edge e of T let Ae \u2282 [n] be the leaves on one side of e and\nlet ae be the number of black vertices on that same side of e. LetP\u03a0(T ) be the subpolytope\nof \u2206(d, n) consisting of all (xi ) such that, for every edge e, ae \u2264 i\u2208Ae xi \u2264 ae + 1 .\n\nProposition 5.1. \u03a0(T ) = P\u03bc(T ) for a series-parallel matroidal \u03bc(T ). Every series-parallel\nmatroid can be written as \u03bc(T ) for some bi-colored trivalent tree T .\n\nWhen it is necessary to emphasize the dependence of \u03a0(T ) or \u03bc(T ) on the coloring c, we\nwrite \u03a0(T, c) or \u03bc(T, c).\nProof. Our proof is by induction on n, when n = 2 the result is clear. Let i and j \u2208 [n] be\ntwo leaves of T that border a common vertex v. Define a new colored trivalent tree T \u2032 by\ndeleting i and j from T and forgetting the coloring of v, which is now a leaf. By induction,\n\u03a0(T \u2032 ) = P\u03bc(T \u2032 ) for a series-parallel matroid \u03bc(T \u2032 ).\n21\n\n\fCase I: v is colored white in T . Then, cutting T at the edge separating i and j from the\nrest of T , we see that xi + xj \u2264 1. We define a map \u03c6 : Rn \u2192 Rn\u22121 by \u03c6(x)v = xi + xj and\n\u03c6(x)k = xk otherwise. An easy inspection of the defining inequalities shows that \u03a0(T ) =\n\u2206(d, n) \u2229 \u03c6\u22121 (\u03a0(T \u2032 )). This precisely says that \u03a0(T ) is the polytope associated to a series\nextension of \u03bc(T \u2032 ) by v.\nCase II: v is colored black in T . This is just like the other case except that xi + xj \u2265 1,\nwe define \u03c6(x)v = xi + xj \u2212 1 and we get a parallel extension.\nTo show that every series-parallel matroid occurs in this way, reverse the argument.\nNot all of the inequalities above are necessary to define \u03a0(T ). The next proposition\nidentifies the facets of \u03a0(T ).\nP\nProposition 5.2. The facets of \u03a0(T ) are given by (1) the equations i\u2208Ae xe \u2265 ae when\ne is an edge connecting two vertices of the opposite color and Ae is the set of leaves on the\nsame side of e as the black endpoint, (2) the equations xi \u2265 0 when i is joined to a white\nvertex and (3) the equations xi \u2264 1 P\nwhen i is joined to a black vertex. (All of these are\nsubject to already having the equality\nxi = d.)\nProof. We first show that all other equations are redundant. Let e be an internal edge with\nAe andPBe the leaves on\nof e and ae and be the number of black\nP each side P\nP vertices on each side.\nThen i\u2208Ae xi = d \u2212 i\u2208Be xi so i\u2208Ae xi \u2264 ae + 1 is equivalent to i\u2208Be xi \u2265 d \u2212 (ae + 1) =\nbe . If i is a leaf joined to a white vertex v, let e and e\u2032 be the other two edges issuing from\nv and let Ae and Ae\u2032 be the sides of e and e\u2032 not containing v. Then\nX\nX\nxj +\nxj \u2265 xi + ae + ae\u2032 = xi + d \u2212 1\nd = xi +\nj\u2208Ae\n\nj\u2208Ae\u2032\n\nso xi \u2264 1. Similarly, if i is a leaf connected to a black vertex, then the other inequalities\nimply xi \u2265 0.\nSuppose that e is an internal edge with endpoints u and v, where u is white. Let e\u2032 and\ne\u2032\u2032 be the other edges containing u and let Ae , Ae\u2032 and Ae\u2032\u2032 each be as above with Ae on the\nu side of e and Ae\u2032 , Ae\u2032\u2032 on the non-u side of e\u2032 and e\u2032\u2032 . Then\nX\nX\nX\nxe =\nxi +\nxi \u2265 ae\u2032 + ae\u2032\u2032 = ae .\ni\u2208Ae\u2032\n\ni\u2208Ae\n\nAe\u2032\u2032\n\nP\n\nA similar argument show that i\u2208Ae xi \u2265 ae is redundant if v is black.\nWe now must show that each of these inequalities\ndoes define a facet. Our proof is by\nP\ninduction on n. First, consider the inequality i\u2208Ae xe \u2265 ae where e connects a black vertex\nx to a white vertex y and Ae is on the x side of e. Let i and j be two leaves of T that border\n22\n\n\fa common vertex v of T . Define T \u2032 and \u03c6 as in the proof of the previous proposition and let\nx\u2032 be a point of T \u2032 where all inequalities except for the one arising from the edge e in T are\nstrict. Then any point x obeying \u03c6(x) = x\u2032 and xi , xj \u2208 (0, 1) will have all inequalities but\nthe required one strict. Similar arguments apply to the other inequalities.\nWe thus see that the facets of \u03a0(T ) which correspond to loop and co-loop free matroids\nare in bijection with the edges joining vertices of different colors, the facets corresponding\nto matroids with a loop correspond to edges joining leaves to black vertices and the facets\ncorresponding to matroids with a co-loop correspond to edges from leaves to white vertices.\nLet T be a trivalent tree. Suppose that e is an internal edge. Define T \\\\e to be the pair\nof trivalent trees formed as follows: Let u and v be the endpoints of e and let {a, b, v} and\n{c, d, u} be the neighbors of u and v respectively. Delete the vertices u and v and all edges\nending at them. Then draw new edges joining a to b and c to d. If e is an edge joining a leaf\ni to a vertex v, we define T \\\\e similarly except that we simply delete the vertex i. We will\nuse the same notation F \\\\e for the analogous construction when F is a forest of trivalent\ntrees and e an internal edge of a tree of F . If T is colored, we let T \\\\e inherit the coloring\nof T in the obvious way.\nProposition 5.3. Let e be an internal edge of T joining two vertices of opposite colors.\nThen the corresponding facet of \u03a0(T ) is \u03a0(T1 ) \u00d7 \u03a0(T2 ) where T \\\\e = T1 \u2294 T2 . If e joins a\nleaf i to a vertex v then the corresponding facet of \u03a0(T ) is \u03a0(T \\\\e) \u00d7 P{i} where {i} is given\nthe structure of a rank 1 matroid if v is black and a rank 0 matroid if v is white.\nThe faces of \u03a0(T ) are in bijection with the possible colored forests that can result from\nrepeated splittings of T along edges connecting vertices of opposite color or connecting leaves\nto the rest of T . The faces of \u03a0(T ) that correspond to loop and co-loop-free matroids are in\nbijection with the possible colored forests that can arise by repeated splittings along internal\nedges between vertices of opposite color.\nProof. The first paragraph follows because it is easy to check that both polytopes are defined\nby the same inequalities. The second paragraph follows by repeatedly using the first.\n\n6\n\nSpecial Cases of the f -Vector Conjecture\n\nIn this section we will prove the following results:\nTheorem\u0001 6.1. Let L be a d-dimensional tropical linear space in n space. Then L has at\nmost n\u22122\nvertices, with equality iff L is series parallel.\nd\u22121\n\nTheorem 6.2. Let L be a d-dimensional tropical linear space in n space with n = 2d or\nn = 2d + 1. Then L has at most 1 bounded facet if n = 2d and at most d if n = 2d + 1.\n23\n\n\fWe first recall the definition of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid. If M is a rank d\nmatroid on the ground set [n] and Y \u2286 [n], let \u03c1M (Y ) denote the rank of Y . The polynomial\nX\nrM (x, y) =\nx|Y |\u2212\u03c1M (Y ) y d\u2212\u03c1M (Y )\nY \u2286[n]\n\nis known as the rank generating function of M. The polynomial\ntM (z, w) = rM (z \u2212 1, w \u2212 1)\nis known as the Tutte polynomial of M. Almost all matroid invariants can be computed\nin terms of the Tutte\nsee Chapter 6 of [17] for a survey of its importance.\nP polynomial;\ni j\nWrite tM (z, w) =\ntij z w . Although not obvious from this definition, all of the tij are\nnonnegative. For n \u2265 2 we have t10 = t01 , this number is known as the beta invariant of M\nand denoted \u03b2(M).\nWe will need the following result:\nProposition 6.3. Let M be a matroid on at least 2 elements. Then \u03b2(M) = 0 if and only\nif M is disconnected and \u03b2(M) = 1 if and only if M is series-parallel.\nProof. See [3], theorem II, for the first statement and [2], theorem 7.6, for the second.\nThe key to proving theorem 6.1 will be proving the following formula:\nLemma 6.4. Let M be a matroid and let D be a matroidal subdivision of PM . Let D\u030a denote\nthe set of internal faces of D. Then\nX\ntM (z, w) =\n(\u22121)dim(PM )\u2212dim(P\u03b3 ) t\u03b3 (z, w).\nP\u03b3 \u2208D\u030a\n\nBefore proving lemma 6.4, let us see why it implies theorem 6.1. Considering the case\nwhere M = \u2206(d, n) and comparing the coefficients of z on each side, we see that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\nn\u22122\n\u03b2(\u03b3).\n=\n\u03b2(\u2206(d, n)) =\nd\u22121\n\u03b3\u2208D\n\u03b3 a facet\n\n(Note that all nonfacets of D\u030a correspond to disconnected matroids and hence have beta\ninvariant 0. and that every facet of D is in D\u030a.)\n\u0001\nEvery term in the right hand sum is a positive integer. Thus, D has at most n\u22122\nfacets,\nd\u22121\nwith equality if and only if all of the facets have beta invariant 1, i.e., if and only if D is a\ndecomposition into series-parallel matroids.\nWe now prove lemma 6.4.\n24\n\n\fProof. Since tM (z, w) = rM (z \u2212 1, w \u2212 1), it is enough to prove\nX\nrM (x, y) =\n(\u22121)dim(PM )\u2212dim(P\u03b3 ) r\u03b3 (x, y).\nP\u03b3 \u2208D\u030a\n\nPlugging in the definition of rM and interchanging summation, it is enough to show that for\nevery Y \u2286 [n],\nX\nx|Y |\u2212\u03c1M (Y ) y d\u2212\u03c1M (Y ) =\n(\u22121)dim(PM )\u2212dim(P\u03b3 ) x|Y |\u2212\u03c1\u03b3 (Y ) y d\u2212\u03c1\u03b3 (Y ) .\n\u03b3\u2208D\u030a\n\nComparing coefficients of x|Y |\u2212r y d\u2212r , we are thus being asked to show that\n\u001a\n\u001b\nX\n1 if r = \u03c1M (Y )\ndim(PM )\u2212dim(P\u03b3 )\n(\u22121)\n=\n.\n0 if r < \u03c1M (Y )\nP\u03b3 \u2208D\u030a\n\u03c1\u03b3 (Y )=r\n\nThe sum is empty if r > \u03c1M (Y ). Equivalently, we will show\nX\n(\u22121)dim(PM )\u2212dim(P\u03b3 ) = 1\nP\u03b3 \u2208D\u030a\n\u03c1\u03b3 (Y )\u2265r\n\nfor all r \u2264 \u03c1M (Y ).\nP\nLet lY be the linear function \u2206(d, n) \u2192 R mapping (xi ) 7\u2192 i\u2208Y xi . Then \u03c1\u03b3 (Y ) =\nmaxx\u2208P\u03b3 lY (x). Thus, we see that \u03c1\u03b3 (Y ) \u2265 r if and only if \u03b3 has a nonempty intersection\nwith the half space lY > r \u2212 1/2. The promised equality now follows by the following lemma\napplied to the polytope PM \u2229 {x : lY (x) > r \u2212 1/2}.\nLemma 6.5.\nP Let P be any bounded polytope and \u0393 the internal faces of a decomposition of\nP . Then \u03b3\u2208\u0393 (\u22121)dim(P )\u2212dim(\u03b3) = 1.\nProof. This sum is (\u22121)dim P (\u03c7(P ) \u2212 \u03c7(\u2202P )) where \u03c7 is the Euler characteristic. As P is\ncontractible and \u2202P is a sphere of dimension dim(P ) \u2212 1, the result follows.\n\nOne might hope to use the higher degree terms of lemma 6.4 to produce additional bounds\non the f -vector of D. Unfortunately, lemma 6.4 is incapable of producing a complete set\nof restrictions. For example, consider the matroids M1 , M2 and M3 corresponding to the\ngraphs in figure 6.\n25\n\n\fM1\n\nM2\n\nM3\n\nFigure 6: The Graphical Matroids M1 , M2 and M3\nThe Tutte polynomials of these matroids are\ntM1 =z + w+2z 2 + 3zw + 2w 2 +z 3 + z 2 w + wz 2 + w 3\nz 2 + 2zw + w 2 +z 3 + 2z 2 w + 2zw 2 + w 3\ntM2 =\ntM3 =\nz 3 + 3z 2 w + 3zw 2 + w 3 .\nWe have\n6tM1 \u2212 9tM2 + 4tM3 = t\u2206(3,6) = 6z + 6w + 3z 2 + 3w 2 + z 3 + w 3 .\nNonetheless, it follows from theorem 6.2 (proved below) that there is no matroidal decomposition of \u2206(3, 6) which has 4 internal faces of codimension 2.\nProof of theorem 6.2. Suppose that L is a d-dimensional tropical linear space in n-space.\nLet M \u2228 be a bounded facet of L, dual to aL\npolytope PM . Then the matroid M has rank d\nand has d connected components. So M = di=1 Mi where each Mi has rank 1 and, because\nM \u2228 is bounded, |Mi | \u2265 2. Let Si be the ground set of Mi , the vertices of PM are those\nsubsets of [n] that meet each Si precisely once.\nNow, consider two such facets M \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 occuring in the same linear space and define\nSi and Si\u2032 as above. The polytope PM \u2229 PM \u2032 must be either matroidal or empty.\nLemma 6.6. Let \u0393 = \u0393(M, M \u2032 ). \u0393 may have multiple edges, let \u0393 be the simple graph\nobtained by replacing each multiple edge of \u0393 by a single edge. Then PM \u2229 PM \u2032 is empty if\nand only if \u0393 has no perfect matchings. PM \u2229 PM \u2032 is matroidal if and only if \u0393 has precisely\none perfect matching.\nA perfect matching of a graph \u0393 is a collection of edges such that, for every vertex v of\n\u0393, exactly one edge in the collection contains v.\n\n26\n\n\fProof. The vertices of PM \u2229 PM \u2032 are in bijection with the perfect matchings of \u0393. There is\nan obvious surjection from perfect matchings of \u0393 to matchings of \u0393. This proves the first\nclaim.\nSuppose that PM \u2229 PM \u2032 is nonempty and matroidal. Let (B1 , B2 ) be an edge of PM \u2229 PM \u2032 ,\nthen B1 and B2 correspond to perfect matchings of \u0393 that differ only by a single edge say\nB1 \\ {e1 } = B2 \\ {e2 }. Then e1 and e2 have the same image in \u0393 in order for both B1 and\nB2 to be perfect matchings. Since every pair of vertices of PM \u2229 PM \u2032 is connected by a chain\nof edges, we see that every perfect matching of \u0393 gives rise to the same perfect matching of\n\u0393 or, in other words, \u0393 has exactly one perfect matching. Conversely, if \u0393 has exactly one\nperfect matching, it is clear that PM \u2229PM \u2032 is a product of simplices and hence matroidal.\nWe now turn to the cases we are interested in, when n = 2d or 2d + 1. We maintain the\nnotation of the lemma. First, suppose that n = 2d. Then every Si must have order 2 so,\nfor any Si and Si\u2032 , \u0393 must consist of disjoint cycles. The only way that \u0393 can be a forest is\nif all of those cycles have length 2. But then {Si } = {Ti }. So we see that a linear space of\ndimension d in 2n space can have at most one bounded facet.\nNow suppose that n = 2d + 1.\nThen all of the Si have order 2 except for one which has order 3. We adopt the convention\nthat |S1 | = 3. \u0393 consists of several disjoint cycles and one component C. C consists of a\npair of vertices v and w of degree 3 with opposite colors and three disjoint paths \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 .\nEither these paths all run from v to w or there is one path each running from v to v, from\nv to w and from w to w.\nIn any of these cases, \u0393 has at least one perfect matching. One can check that the only\ncase where \u0393 has only one perfect matching is when all of the cycles of \u0393 \\ C have length\n2 and C consists of a path from v to w and two cycles of length 2, one containing v and\nthe other containing w. The second condition is equivalent to requiring that Si\u2032\u2032 \u2282 S1 and\nSi \u2282 S1\u2032 for some i and i\u2032 .\nNow, consider all of the three element subsets of [n] that occur as an S1 for some bounded\nfacet of L. We first note that, if S1 = T1 then Si = Ti for every i (after reordering) as\notherwise \u0393 would have a cycle of length more than 2. So all of these three element subsets\nare different. Also, if |S1 \u2229 T1 | = 2 then there are two paths between S1 and T1 and \u0393 has\nmore than one perfect matching.\nLet f be the number of bounded facets of L. Build a graph whose vertices are the various\nr\nS1 and the elements {1, . . . , n} and where there is an edge between S1r and k if k \u2208 S1r . This\ngraph has f + n = f + 2d + 1 vertices and 3f edges. Thus, if f > d, this graph has as\nmany edges as vertices and must contain a cycle. In other words, there exist i1 , . . . , if , j1 ,\n. . . , jf \u2208 [n] and facets corresponding to collections (Ssr ), 1 \u2264 s \u2264 d, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 f such that\nS1r = {ir , ir+1 , jr }, where the index r is cyclic modulo f .\n27\n\n\f\u2032\n\nNow, for any r and r \u2032 , there must be some Ssr \u2282 S1r . Consider first the case where\n\u2032\nr = r + 1. Then {jr+1 , ir+2 } must be one of the Ssr , as we already know ir+1 \u2208 S1r . Now\nconsider when r \u2032 = r + 2. We get that {jr+2 , ir+3 } must be one of the Ssr , as ir+2 , the other\n\u2032\nmember of S1r , is already contained in {jr+1 , ir+2 }. Continuing in this manner, we get that\n{jr+k , ir+k+1} is an Ssr for every k. But, when k = f \u2212 1, this intersects S1r , contradicting\nthat the Sir are distinct.\nRemark\n\u0001 6.7. The f -vector conjecture predicts that, if n = 2d + e, L should have at most\nd+e\u22121\nbounded facets. In the cases e = 0 and e = 1, \u0393 always had at least one matching\ne\nand the requirement that \u0393 have exactly one is very restrictive. Once e = 2, it is possible\nfor \u0393 to have no perfect matchings and the problem grows much harder.\nNonetheless, I suspect that this kind of reasoning, looking only at the facets of L and\nnot at the smaller spaces that contain them, is adequate to resolve the f -vector conjecture\nfor facets once e \u2265 2. More specifically, I conjecture:\n\u0001\nProblem 6.8. Let n = 2d + e. It is not possible to find more than d+e\u22121\ndistinct partitions\ne\nof [n] into d disjoint subsets, [n] = S1r \u2294 * * * \u2294 Sdr where each Ssr has order at least 2 and, for\n\u2032\n\u2032\nevery r and r \u2032 , the graph \u0393 formed from {S1r , . . . , Sdr } and {S1r , * * * , Sdr } has at most one\nperfect matching.\n\n7\n\nResults on Constructible Spaces\n\nIn this section, we will prove several of the previously stated results on contructible spaces.\nOur first aim is to prove theorem 1.3: that every constructible space is series-parallel.\nClearly, L\u22a5 is series-parallel if L is, since the dual of a series-parallel matroid is series-parallel.\nSo it is enough to show that, if L and L\u2032 are two series-parallel tropical linear spaces that\nmeet transversely then L \u2229 L\u2032 is as well.\nLet L and L\u2032 be two tropical linear spaces of dimensions d and d\u2032 in n space which meet\ntransversely at a point w. Let D and D \u2032 be the appropriate subdivisions of \u2206(d,Ln) and\n\u2206(d\u2032 , n). Let\nM \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 be the faces of D \u2228 and (D \u2032 )\u2228 containing w. Let M = i\u2208I Mi\nL\nand M \u2032 = i\u2208I \u2032 Mi\u2032 be the connected components of M and M \u2032 . We claim that all of the\nMi and Mi\u2032 are series parallel. PM will be a face of some facet PM\u0303 of D, so this follows from\nLemma 7.1. Let M\u0303 be aLseries-parallel matroid and let PM be a face of PM\u0303 , assume that\nM is loop-free. Let M =\nMi be the decomposition of M into connected components. Then\neach of the Mi are series-parallel.\n28\n\n\fProof. This follows from the description of the faces of M\u0303 in lemma 5.3. (Note that a rank\none matroid on a single element is series-parallel.)\nThe result now follows from\nL\nL \u2032\nProposition 7.2. Let M =\nMi and M \u2032 =\nMi be transverse matroids on [n] with all\nof the Mi and Mi\u2032 series-parallel. Then M \u2227 M \u2032 is a direct sum of series-parallel matroids,\nand is series parallel if it is connected.\nProof. M \u2227 M \u2032 is formed by a sequence of parallel connections. The parallel connection of\ntwo series-parallel matroids is series-parallel.\nOur next goal is to prove theorem 1.2 \u2013 every constructible space achieves the f -vector\nof the f -vector conjecture.\nLemma 7.3. Let M be a series-parallel matroid. Call a flat Q of M \"good\" if M|Q and\nM/Q are connected and not loops. Let f and g \u2208 M. Then the collection of all good flats Q\nsuch that f \u2208 Q, g 6\u2208 Q forms a chain Q1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Qd . Moreover, the length d of this chain\nis preserved when the roles of f and g are switched.\nWe define d(f, g) to be d.\nProof. If Q is good then M|Q \u2295 M/Q corresponds to a facet of M. Let M = \u03bc(T ). By\nlemma 5.3, all of the facets of PM correspond to either edges of T which contain a leaf or\nedges of T that connect to vertices of opposite colors. Under that correspondence, an edge\ne corresponds to a good flat that contains f and not g if and only if e separates f and g\nwith the end closer to g colored black and the end closer to f either colored white or equal\nto e. Consider the path \u03b3 through T connecting f and g, divide \u03b3 into alternating blocks of\nwhite and black vertices. Then we see that the number of good flats containing f and not g\nis equal to the number of black blocks. This number is the same when f and g are switched.\nThe flat corresponding to e consists of the leaves of T that are on the non-black end of e.\nThus, all of the flats in question are nested.\nOur first major goal on the way to proving theorem 1.2, nontrivial in its own right, is to\nprove:\nTheorem 7.4. Let L and L\u2032 be two series-parallel tropical linear spaces in n-space, of dimensions d and d\u2032 . Let a and b \u2208 Rn be such that L meets L\u2032 + a and L\u2032 + b transversely.\nThen L \u2229 (L\u2032 + a) and L \u2229 (L\u2032 + b) have the same bounded f -vector.\n\n29\n\n\fProof of theorem 7.4. Let Ui \u2208 Rn be the set of v such that, for any two faces F and F \u2032 of L\nand L\u2032 , either the realtive interiors of F and F \u2032 + v are disjoint or they span an affine linear\nspace of dimension at least n \u2212 i. Thus, L and L\u2032 + v meet transversely if and only if v \u2208 U0 .\nRn \\ Ui is a polyhedral complex of dimension at most n \u2212 i \u2212 1. In particular, we see that U1\nis path connected. We may therefore join a and b by a path through U1 . It is thus enough to\nshow that, if v \u2208 U1 \\ U0 and we perturb v into U0 then the f -vector we get is independent\nof the choice of perturbation. Without loss of generality, we may assume that v = 0.\nLet N \u2228 be a face of L \u2229 L\u2228 at which two faces M \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 fail to meet transversely.\nstable\nL\nL\nLet the connected components of M and M \u2032 be i\u2208I Mi and i\u2208I \u2032 Mi\u2032 and let \u0393 = \u0393(M, M \u2032 ).\nThis time, since M \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 only span an affine hyperplane, \u0393 will have first betti\nnumber 1 and will thus contain a unique cycle. Let e1 , . . . , e2r be the edges of that cycle in\ncyclic order. (\u0393 is bipartite so the cycle has even length.) Write vi and vi+1 for the ends of\n(\u2032 )\nei and write Mv to mean Mv if v \u2208 I and Mv\u2032 if v \u2208 I \u2032 .\nNow, let w \u2208 Rn and let Ew be the decomposition of \u2206(d + d\u2032 \u2212 n, n) associated to\nL \u2229 (L\u2032 + w). For \u01eb a sufficiently small positive real number, Eew is a subdivision of E0 .\nstable\n\nWe will explore how the interior of PN decomposes in E\u01ebw .\n\nP\ni\nLemma 7.5. There exist decompositions E+ and E\u2212 of PN such that, if \u00b1 2r\ni=1 (\u22121) wei >\n0 then N is subdivided according to E\u00b1 in E\u01ebw for \u01eb a sufficiently small\n\u0001 positive number.\nD\nMoreover, there is an integer D such that E+ and E\u2212 each have c+1 interior faces of\ncodimension c.\nThe theorem follows from this lemma, as any generic perturbation of L \u2229 L\u2032 to L \u2229\nstable\nP\n(L\u2032 + w) is going to have (\u22121)i wei 6= 0 and this lemma shows that the f -vector changes\nin the same way under all such perturbations. (There may be several different PN which all\nsubdivide under perturbation, but we may apply the lemma to each of them.)\n\n\u2032 \u2228\nProof of lemma 7.5: By assumption, M \u2228 and (M\nspan a hyperplane, call this\nP ) together\ni\nhyperplane H. Explicitly, the equation of H is (\u22121) xei = 0. If we perturb L\u2032 to L\u2032 + w\nfor w 6\u2208 H, M \u2228 and (M \u2032 )\u2228 + w will not meet. Instead, there will be faces PF and PF \u2032 of PM\nand PM \u2032 with M \u2228 \u2282 F \u2228 \u2282 L and (M \u2032 )\u2228 \u2282 (F \u2032 )\u2228 \u2282 L\u2032 , such that the relative interiors of F \u2228\nand (F \u2032 )\u2228 were previously disjoint but now meet and contribute faces to the subdivision of\nPN . For any given pair (F, F \u2032), whether the relative interiors of F \u2228 and (F \u2032 )\u2228 + \u01ebw meet or\nnot for small \u01eb will depend only on the side of H on which w lies.\nThe facets occurring in the subdivision of PN will came from pairs (F, F \u2032 ) where either\nF = M and F \u2032 is a loop-free facet of M \u2032 or vice versa. We will concentrate on the former\ncase. Every loop-free facet of M is of the form M|Q \u2295 M/Q for Q a good flat of some\n\n30\n\n\fparticular irreducible component Mi of M. The localP\ncone of F \u2228 at 0 is the span of the\n\u2228\nlinear space spanned by M and a ray in the direction q\u2208Q eq . Note that Q \u2229 {e1 , . . . , e2r }\ncontains at most 2 elements. We thus see that the image of this cone in the one dimensional\nspace Rn /H is 0 unless exactly one of {e1 , . . . , e2r } lies in Q. If this cone maps to 0 in Rn /H\nthen F \u2228 \u2229 ((F \u2032 )\u2228 + w) = \u2205 for w 6\u2208 H. If Q \u2229P\n{e1 , . . . , e2r } = {ek } then F lies on one side of H\ni\nif k is even and the other if k is odd. So, if 2r\nhave F \u2228 \u2229 ((F \u2032 )\u2228 + w) = \u2205\ni=1 (\u22121) ewi > 0,\nPwe\n2r\nif k is even and is nonempty if k is odd; the reverse holds if i=1 (\u22121)i ewi < 0.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAfter running through\nP thei same argument in the case that F = M and F is a facet\nof M, we see that, if (\u22121) wei > 0, then PN is divided into a number of facets equal\nto the number of good flats\nas i runs from 1 to 2d. In other\nP2rcontaining ei and not ei+1P\nwords, PN is divided into i=1 d(ei , ei+1 ) facets. When (\u22121)i wei < 0, PN is divided into\nP\n2r\ni=1 d(ei+1 , ei ) facets. These sums are equal to a common value, call it D, by\nP lemma 7.3.\nA similar argument shows that the number of codimension c faces when (\u22121)i wei > 0\nis the number of ways of, for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2r, choosing a chain Qi1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 * * * Qiqi of flats\nP\n(\u2032 )\nin Mvi containing ei\u22121 and not ei subject to the condition\nqi = c +\u0001 1. This is clearly the\nD\nsame as choosing c + 1 of the D flats counted above, so there are c+1\ncodimension c faces.\nP\ni\nA practically identical argument shows the same in the case (\u22121) wei < 0.\n\nWe now are ready to begin our final assault on theorem 1.2. We will first need to study\nhow the various faces of \u2206(d, n) are subdivided in a constructible decomposition. Let S and\nT be disjoint subsets of [n]. Write \u2206(d, n)\\S/T for the face of \u2206(d, n) given by the equations\nxi = 0 for i \u2208 S and xi = 1 for i \u2208 T . If p is a tropical Pl\u00fccker vector then define p \\ S/T to\nbe the function on the vertices of \u2206(d \u2212 |T |, n \u2212 |S| \u2212 |T |) given by (p \\ S/T )I = pI\u222aT . It is\nclear that p \\ S/T obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations, as they are a subset of the tropical\nPl\u00fccker relations for p. So p \\ S/T corresponds to a tropical d \u2212 |T | plane in n \u2212 |S| \u2212 |T |\nspace. If L is the tropical linear space corresponding to p then we write L \\ S/T for the\ntropical linear space corresponding to p \\ S/T .\nLemma 7.6. If L is a constructible d-plane in n-space and S and T are disjoint subsets of\n[n] then L \\ S/T is also constructible.\nProof. If L is a hyperplane then every L \\ S/T is either a hyperplane or the whole space in\nwhich it sits, and hence is constructible. Now suppose that the lemma holds for L. Then it\nholds for L\u22a5 as L\u22a5 \\ S/T = (L \\ T /S)\u22a5 . Suppose that the lemma holds for L and L\u2032 . Then\nit holds for L \u2229 L\u2032 as (L \u2229 L\u2032 ) \\ S/T = (L \\ \u2205/(S \u222a T )) \u2229 (L\u2032 \\ S/T ).\nstable\n\nstable\n\nstable\n\nProof of theorem 1.2. Our proof is by induction, first on n and then on the number of steps\n\n31\n\n\fused to construct L. We set\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n(n \u2212 i \u2212 1)!\nn \u2212 2i n \u2212 i \u2212 1\n=\nfi,d,n =\n.\ni\u22121\nd\u2212i\n(i \u2212 1)!(d \u2212 i)!(n \u2212 d \u2212 i)!\nFirst, suppose that the theorem is true for L. L\u22a5 and L have the same bounded f vector, so the theorem for L\u22a5 follows from the symmetry fi,d,n = fi,n\u2212d,n . For the rest of\nthe proof, suppose that L and L\u2032\u2032 are a constructible d-plane and d\u2032 plane in n space which\nmeet transversely and for which we know the theorem to hold. In addition, we know that\nthe theorem holds for every L \\ S/T and L\u2032\u2032 \\ S/T by our inductive hypothesis. Our aim will\nbe to prove the theorem for L \u2229 L\u2032\u2032 .\nBy theorem 7.4, it is enough to prove the result for L \u2229 (L\u2032\u2032 + w) where w is chosen\ngenerically enough. We will take a w for which w1 \u226a w2 \u226a * * * \u226a wn and otherwise generic.\nSet L\u2032 = L\u2032\u2032 + w.\nSuppose that M \u2228 is a face of L dual to PM \u2282 \u2206(d, n). Then M is loop-free, let T\nbe the set of isthmi of M so that M lies in the relative interior of \u2206(d, n) \\ \u2205/T . Then\nM \u2228 /(1, . . . , 1) is the product of RT+ and a bounded polytope. Let (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 be a face of L\u2032\u2032 and\ndefine T \u2032 similarly. We write (M \u2032 )\u2228 = (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 + w and M \u2032 = M \u2032\u2032 .\nDefine an ordered pair (T, T \u2032 ) of subsets of [n] to be nice if, for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, either\nj \u2208 T or i \u2208 T \u2032 .\nLemma 7.7. For w1 \u226a w2 \u226a * * * \u226a wn , we have M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 6= \u2205 if and only if (T, T \u2032 ) is\nnice. If (T, T \u2032 ) is nice then M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 is bounded if and only if T \u2229 T \u2032 = \u2205.\n.\nProof. First, suppose that (T, T \u2032) is not nice, so there exists some i < j with j 6\u2208 T and\ni 6\u2208 T \u2032 . On M \u2228 , xj \u2212 xi is bounded above (as j 6\u2208 T ). On (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 , xj \u2212 xi is similarly bounded\nbelow. The value of xj \u2212 xi on (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 is wj \u2212 wi larger than on (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 , so if wj \u2212 wi is large\nenough then the values of this functional on M \u2228 and (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 + w will be distinct. Thus, M \u2228\nand (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 + w will be disjoint.\nNow suppose that (T, T \u2032 ) is nice. Let (xi ) \u2208 M \u2228 and (x\u2032\u2032i ) \u2208 (M \u2032\u2032 )\u2228 , set x\u2032i = x\u2032\u2032i + wi\nand set di = x\u2032i \u2212 xi . For w large enough, we have d1 < d2 < * * * < dn . The hypothesis that\n(T, T \u2032 ) is good implies that there is some b \u2208 [n] such that i \u2208 T \u2032 for every i < b and j \u2208 T \u2032\nfor every j > b. After translating (xi ) by (1, . . . , 1), which will not change the assumption\nthat (xi ) \u2208 M, we may assume that xb = x\u2032b . Consider the point\nz = (x1 , . . . , xb\u22121 , xb , xb+1 + db+1 , . . . xn + dn ) = (x\u20321 \u2212 d1 , . . . , x\u2032b\u22121 \u2212 db\u22121 , x\u2032b , x\u2032b+1 , . . . x\u2032n ).\n\u2032\n\nClearly, z \u2208 (xi ) + RT\u22650 and z \u2208 (x\u2032i ) + RT\u22650 , so z \u2208 M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 . We have now proved the\nfirst claim.\n32\n\n\fNow assume that (T, T \u2032 ) is nice, so there is some point z = (zi ) \u2208 M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 . Suppose\nthat i \u2208 T \u2229 T \u2032 . Then z + uei \u2208 M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 for every u > 0 and M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 is unbounded.\nSuppose, on the other hand, that T \u2229 T \u2032 = \u2205. Consider any i < j. If neither i nor j is\nin T then xi \u2212 xj is bounded on M \u2228 ; if neither i nor j is in T \u2032 then xi \u2212 xj is bounded on\n(M \u2032 )\u2228 ; if j \u2208 T and i \u2208 T \u2032 then xi \u2212 xj is bounded above on M \u2228 and below on (M \u2032 )\u2228 . In\nany of these cases, we see that xi \u2212 xj is bounded on M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 . So all of the xi \u2212 xj are\nbounded on M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 which implies that (M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 )/(1, . . . , 1) is bounded.\nM \u2228 corresponds to a bounded face of L \\ \u2205/T . Writing t = |T |, if this bounded face\nis j-dimensional then M \u2228 is (j + t)-dimensional. Similarly writing t\u2032 = |T \u2032 | and j \u2032 for the\ndimension of the face of L\u2032 \\ \u2205/T \u2032 corresponding to (M \u2032 )\u2228 , the dimension of (M \u2032 )\u2228 is j \u2032 + t\u2032 .\nThe dimension of M \u2228 \u2229 (M \u2032 )\u2228 is then j + j \u2032 + t + t\u2032 \u2212 n. We thus see that the number of\ni-dimensional bounded faces of L \u2229 L\u2032 is\nX\nX\nfj,d\u2212t,n\u2212t fj \u2032 ,d\u2032 \u2212t\u2032 ,n\u2212t\u2032 .\n(T,T \u2032 ) nice j+j \u2032 +t+t\u2032 \u2212n=i\nT \u2229T \u2032 =\u2205\n\nThe only nice pairs (T, T \u2032) with T \u2229 T \u2032 = \u2205 are ({1, . . . , b \u2212 1}, {b + 1, . . . , n}) and\n({1, . . . , b}, {b + 1, . . . , n}).

First, we will need to summarize\nsome results from [15] concerning the case d = 2.\nLet T be a tree with leaves labeled by [n] and no vertices of degree 2. Let each edge e\nof T be assigned a length l(e), which is a positive real number if e is internal (i.e. if neither\nendpoints of e is a leaf) and\nP can be any real number if one of e's endpoints is a leaf. For i\nand j \u2208 [n], set d(i, j) = l(e) where the sum is over all edges e separating i and j.\n\nTheorem 8.1. Let L be a tropical 2-plane in n-space. Then there exists a tree T as above\nsuch that pij = \u2212(1/2)d(i, j). Moreover, L/(1, . . . , 1) is an embedding of T \\ {leaves of T }\nin Rn /(1, . . . , 1), where the bounded part of L/(1, . . . , 1) is the image of the internal edges\nof T . For every such T , set pij = (\u22121/2)d(i, j), pij obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations.\np is generic if and only if the corresponding L is series-parallel if and only if the tree T\nis trivalent ( i.e. every non-leaf has degree 3.) Every 2-dimensional tropical linear space is\nrealizable.\nProof. See [15], section 4.\nNote that this implies that L/(1, . . . 1) has at most n \u2212 2 vertices and at most n \u2212 3\nbounded edges, with equality precisely when L is series-parallel. So the f -vector conjecture\nis true when d = 2.\nNow, suppose that pij obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations and corresponds to a tropical 2\u0001\nP\nplane L and to a tree T . We define a real valued function \u03c4 d (p) on [n]\nby \u03c4 d (p)I = i,j\u2208I pij .\nd\ni<j\n\nProposition 8.2. \u03c4 d (p) obeys the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations.\n\nThis can be checked in a routine manner, but we give a different proof that explains the\nmotivation behind the formula. We will call the tropical linear space associated to \u03c4 d (p) the\ndth tree space of L and denote it \u03c4 d (L).\n34\n\n\fProof. We know that pij is realizable, meaning that we can find power series x1 (t), . . . xn (t),\ny1 (t), . . . , yn (t) in K such that pij = v(xi yj \u2212 xj yi ). Consider the linear space\n\uf8eb d\u22121\n\uf8f6\nx1\nxd\u22121\nxd\u22121\n* * * xd\u22121\n2\n3\nn\n\uf8ecxd\u22122 y xd\u22122 y xd\u22122 y * * * xd\u22122 y \uf8f7\nn\uf8f7\nn\n\uf8ec 1 1 2 2 3 3\nRowSpan \uf8ec ..\n..\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8ed .\n.\n.\n***\n. \uf8f8\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\ny1\ny2\ny3\n* * * yn\n\nd\u2212s s\u22121\nQ The maximal minor Pi1 ,...,id of this matrix is the Vandermonde determinant det(xir yir ) =\nir <is (xir yis \u2212 xis yir ). So\n\nv(PI ) =\n\nX\n\nv(xir yis \u2212 xis yir ) =\n\ni,j\u2208I\ni<j\n\nX\n\npij = \u03c4 d (p)I .\n\ni,j\u2208I\ni<j\n\nSo the \u03c4 d (p)I come from an actual linear space over a power series field and hence obey the\ntropical Pl\u00fccker relations.\nRemark 8.3. This construction is reminiscient of the construction of cyclic polytopes (see,\nfor example, [18] example 0.6) and osculating flags (see [11], section 5), two other objects\nwhich realize maximal combinatorics.\nIn this section, we will give a complete description of the bounded part of \u03c4 d (L) in terms\nof the combinatorics of T . We will make heavy use of the results of section 5. From now on,\nwe assume that T is trivalent.\n\u0001\nTheorem 8.4. The vertices of \u03c4 d (L) are of the form \u03bc(T, c)\u2228 where c ranges over the n\u22122\nd\u22121\nways to color the internal vertices of T black and white with d \u2212 1 colored black and n \u2212 d \u2212 1\ncolored white. The bounded i-dimensional faces of \u03c4 d (T ) are in bijection with the ordered\npairs (F, c), where F is a forest with i trees that can be obtained by splitting T along internal\nedges and c is a black and white coloring of the internal vertices of F using d\u2212i black vertices\nand n\u2212d\u2212i white vertices. (F, c) is contained in (F \u2032 , c\u2032 ) if and only if (F \u2032 , c\u2032 ) can be obtained\nfrom (F, c) by repeated splitting along edges connecting vertices of opposite colors.\nProof. It is enough to prove the first claim, the rest then follows from the description of the\nfaces of \u03a0(T, c) in lemma 5.3. Let D be the subdivision of \u2206(d, n) corresponding to \u03c4 d (L),\nwe must describe the facets of D. If e is an edge of T , write [n] = Ae \u2294 Be for the partition\nof the leaves of T induced by splitting along e. If we have fixed a coloring of T , let ae be the\nnumber of black vertices on the Ae side of e.\n35\n\n\fWe have\nX\nX\npij = (\u22121/2)\npI =\ni,j\u2208I\ni<j\n\nX\n\nl(e) = (\u22121/2)\n\nX\n\nl(e)|Ae \u2229 I| (d \u2212 |Ae \u2229 I|) .\n\ne\n\ni,j\u2208I e separates i and j\ni<j\n\nFor any edge e of T , set fe (I) = \u2212(1/2)l(e)|Ae \u2229 I| (d \u2212 |Ae \u2229 I|). For e containing a\nleaf, fe is a linear functional. For e internal, fe is convex (this uses l(e) > 0). So D is\nthe common refinement of the subdivisions of \u2206(d, n) induced by each of the subdivisions\ninduced by P\nthe convex functions fe . The subdivision induced by fe is to cut \u2206(d, n) into the\npieces k < i\u2208Ae xi < k + 1 for k \u2208 Z.\nSo the facets of D are the nonempty sets of the form\n)\n(\nX\nxi < ke + 1 \u2200e\u2208T\nx : ke <\ni\u2208Ae\n\nfor some integers ke . When the ke arise as the ae for some coloring c, this set is the interior\nof \u03a0(T, c) and hence not empty. We now must show that all the facets of D arise in this\nmanner. It is enough to show that a generic point of \u2206(d, n) lies in \u03a0(T, c) for some coloring\nc of T .\npoint of \u2206(d, n) and let ke and le be the integers such that ke <\nP Let xi be a generic P\ni\u2208Ae xi < ke + 1, le <\ni\u2208Be xi < le + 1, so ke + le = d \u2212 1. Let v be an internal vertex of\nT with edges e1 , e2 and e3 ending at v. Without loss of generality, suppose that Aes is the\nnon-u side of es for s = 1, 2, 3. Then\nke1 + ke2 + ke3 <\n\n3 X\nX\n\nxi = d < k1 + k2 + k3 + 3\n\ns=1 i\u2208Aes\n\nso ke1 + ke2 + ke3 = d \u2212 1 or d \u2212 2. We color v white if this sum is d \u2212 1 and black if it is\nd \u2212 2.\nWe claim that precisely d \u2212 1 vertices are colored black. Let B denote the set of vertices\nthat are colored black and W those that are colored white. We have\nX\n(ke + le ) = (2n \u2212 3)(d \u2212 1) = |B|(d \u2212 2) + |W |(d \u2212 1) + n(d \u2212 1)\ne\u2208T\n\nwhere the second expression comes from grouping the sum on vertices. We have |B| + |W | =\nn \u2212 2 so\n|B|(d \u2212 2) + |W |(d \u2212 1) + n(d \u2212 1) = (d \u2212 1)(2n \u2212 2) \u2212 |B|.\n36\n\n\fWe deduce that (2n \u2212 3)(d \u2212 1) = (2n \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1) \u2212 |B| and thus |B| = d \u2212 1. We now will\nshow that (xi ) is contained in the polytope \u03a0(T, c).\nLet e be an internal\nedge of T and let ae be the number of black\nP\nP vertices on a chosen side\nof e. Then ke < i\u2208Ae xi < ke + 1 and we want to show ae < i\u2208Ae xi < ae + 1. Let S be\nthe subtree of T lying on the Ae side of e and let S have s vertices, s \u2212 |Ae | internal vertices\nand s \u2212 1 edges. We have\nX\n(ke + le ) = (s \u2212 1)(d \u2212 1) = ae (d \u2212 2) + (s \u2212 |Ae | \u2212 ae )(d \u2212 1) + |Ae |(d \u2212 1) \u2212 le\ne\u2282S\n\nby once again grouping the sum on edges and on vertices. Canceling, we get ae = d \u22121 \u2212le =\nke .\nSo we have shown that a generic point of \u2206(d, n) lies in \u03a0(T, c) for some coloring c of T\nand we are done.\nCorollary 8.5. \u03c4 d (L) has fi,d,n =\n\n\u0001\n\nn\u22122i\nd\u2212i\n\n\u0001\n\nn\u2212i\u22121\ni\u22121\n\nbounded faces of dimension i.\n\nProof. We must count the i tree forests F\u0001 which can be obtained by repeated splittings of\nT and then multiply this number by n\u22122i\n, the number of ways to choose which vertices to\nd\u2212i\n\u0001\ncolor black. Thus, it is enough to show that every trivalent tree T can be split into n\u2212i\u22121\ni\u22121\ndifferent i tree forests by splitting along internal edges. Let Fi,n denote the number\nof ways\n\u0001\nto split a trivalent n leaf tree into an i tree forest. We will prove Fi,n = n\u2212i\u22121\nby induction\ni\u22121\non n, it is clearly true for n = 3.\nLet a and b be two leaves of T that have a common neighbor v. Let F be an i tree\nforest obtained by splitting T along internal edges. Clearly, no sequence of splittings can\never separate a and b. There are then two cases: the tree of F that contains {a, b} contains\nno other leaves, or it has some other leaf.\nCase I: {a, b} is a component of F . Let e be the edge joining v to the rest of T . Then, at\nsome point in the splitting procedure, e is split and we may as well assume that it is the first\nstep. Let T \u2032 be the component of T \\\\e other than {a, b}. The number of F for which this\ncase applies is then the number of i \u2212 1 tree forests obtainable by splitting T \u2032 , or Fi\u22121,n\u22122 .\nCase II: The component of F containing {a, b} has additional vertices. Let T \u2032\u2032 be the\ntree obtained by shrinking a, b and v down to a single leaf. The number of F for which this\ncase applies is the same as the number \u0001of i tree forests\nobtainable\nby splitting T \u2032\u2032 , or Fi,n\u22121 .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nn\u2212i\u22122\nn\u2212i\u22122\nn\u2212i\u22121\nSo Fi,n = Fi\u22121,n\u22122 + Fi,n\u22121 = i\u22122 + i\u22121 = i\u22121 as desired.\n\n37\n\n\fReferences\n[1] F.
