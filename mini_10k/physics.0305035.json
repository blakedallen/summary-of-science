Birla Science Centre, Adarsh Nagar, Hyderabad - 500 063 (India)\nAbstract\nWe review Cantorian and Non Commutative Spacetime, work which\nhas occupied El Naschie in the past several years. These concepts\nare now the subject of intense research, thanks to Quantum Gravity,\nQuantum Super String Theory and a few other approaches. It now\nappears that we are on the verge of a breakthrough in finding solutions to longstanding problems, like the unification of gravitation with\nother fundamental interactions and the question of the mass spectrum,\nanother recent area of El Naschie's work.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is now a cliche that the two great intellectual pillars of the twentieth century, viz., General Relativity or, more generally, Gravitation and Quantum\nMechanics have stood apart, stubbornly defying attempts at unifying them.\nAs Wheeler [1] noted, the problem finally boils down to the introduction of\nthe Quantum Mechanical concept of spin half into Classical Theory and the\nclassical concept of curvature into Quantum Theory. Curiously enough the\ntwo pillars of General Relativity and Quantum Theory stand on a common\nground: Together they use the concept of a differentiable space time manifold, be it the Reimannian space time of General Relativity or the Minkowski\nspace time of Relativistic Quantum Theory or Quantum Field Theory. However more recent work be it in Quantum Gravity or in Quantum Super String\nTheory, has hinted at a minimum space time cut off [2, 3, 4]. This alters the\n1\n\n\fage cold concept of a smooth space time. In recent years there has been\nquite some work by different authors such as Ord, Nottale, El Naschie, the\nauthor and others in this relatively new field of non differentiable space time\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and several references therein. One of the very fruitful concepts put forward in these pathbreaking efforts has been El Naschie's\nconcept of the Cantorian space time. Atlast some schoalrs are beginning to\nrealize the fractal nature of space time. Once we break out of the smooth\nspacetime mindset, many exciting possibilities open up, including a unification of gravitation with other fundamental interactions, and also the possibility of solving the elusive problem of the mass spectrum, as has been deduced\nby El Naschie for example [38].\nWe will briefly survey some of these efforts and indicate how the solution of\nlongstanding problems are now within sight.\n\n2\n\nNon Commutative Spacetime\n\nWe start with a Quantum Mechanical description. In Quantum Theory, it\nis well known that spacetime points pose a major difficulty. By the Uncertainity principle, if we go down to such points, we will end up with infinite\nmomenta and energies. This situation comes up clearly in the case of the\nQuantum Mechanical treatment of the electron [12]. We encounter electrons\nwith the velocity of light and rapid oscillations termed zitterbewegung. At\nthat time Dirac realised this problem and correctly explained the anamoly by\nnoting that only observations averaged over small intervals at the Compton\nscale are physically meaningful. Within the Compton scale there are well\nknown non local effects. This is a major departure from classical considerations where we use spacetime points.\nNevertheless Quantum Theory has continued using classical space time as\na background. This has lead, for example to the problem of infinities and\nresonances found by Poincare much earlier in classical theory [13]. For example in Classical Electrodynamics, the relativistic generalisation of the well\nknown Lorentz equation is the Lorentz-Dirac equation. This equation shows\nunphysical characteristics, such as third derivatives with respect to time, run\naway solutions with infinite energy and so on [13, 14]. The infinite energy\nin this case is attributed to the infinite energy which an electron, treated as\na spherical shell, acquires when the radius of the shell tends to zero. But it\nis remarkable that even in Classical Electrodynamics the infinities and non\n2\n\n\flocal effects are confined to the same Quantum Mechanical Compton scale\n[14].\nOne way in which Quantum Field Theory has dodged these unpleasant features is by using the renormalization technique. To put it briefly, the physical\nquantity we observe, for example the mass or charge consist of two components: One is the \"actual\" or bare value and the other is a value due to\nthe above effects. What is important ultimately is the physical quantity we\nobserve. So if we can find a model in which the bare value and the infinite\nvalue somehow add up to give the correct physical value in the limit, then the\ntheory is renormalizable, because in any case what happens within the small\nintervals is ultimately of no consequence [15, 16]. Dirac himself was critical\nof this approach and predicted that one day it would be proved wrong [17].\nHe observed, \"I am inclined to suspect that the renormalization theory is\nsomething that will not survive in the future, and that the remarkable agreement between its results and experiment should be looked on as a fluke.\"\nIn parallel a number of scholars such as Snyder had tried to work out theories which recognized minimum intervals as a way to eliminate the infinities\n[18, 19, 11].This work did not find favour for many years.\nHowever relatively recent developments from two separate directions, that of\nQuantum Gravity and Quantum Super String theory have lead back to the\nnotion of a minimum space time scale [3, 2, 4]: The Planck Scale (10\u221233 cms\nand 10\u221243 secs) which is the Compton scale for a particle with a Planck mass,\n10\u22125 gms. Interestingly Max Planck himself had noted that the Planck scale\nis made up of a combination of the fundamental constants and therefore must\nbe fundamental. In recent years there has been a growing body of literature\nwhich argues that the Planck scale is indeed such a fundamental minimum\nscale.\nThe introduction of such a minimum scale, instead of space time points leads\nto consequences far beyond the classical description. Space time now becomes\nnon commutative [20, 21], the Uncertainity principle takes on an extra term,\nsometimes called the duality term [21, 22] and so on. Specifically, we have,\n[x, y] = (\u0131a2 /h\u0304)Lz , [t, x] = (\u0131a2 /h\u0304c)Mx ,\n[y, z] = (\u0131z 2 /h\u0304)Lx , [t, y] = (\u0131a2 /h\u0304c)My ,\n[x, x] = (\u0131a2 h\u0304)Ly , [t, z] = (\u0131a2 /h\u0304c)Mz ,\n[x, px ] = \u0131h\u0304[1 + (a/h\u0304)2 p2x ];\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\f[t, pt ] = \u0131h\u0304[1 \u2212 (a/h\u0304c)2 p2t ];\n\n[x, py ] = [y, px ] = \u0131h\u0304(a/h\u0304)2 px py ;\n\n(2)\n\n[x, pt ] = c2 [px , t] = \u0131h\u0304(a/h\u0304)2 px pt ; etc.\nNon relativistic Quantum Theory follows from (1) if a2 is neglected, though\nspacetime is now commutative as in the usual theory. The modification to\nthe Uncertainity Principle is seen in equation (2) when terms \u223c 0(a2 ) are\nretained. All this also averts, what Wheeler had called the greatest crisis\nof Physics, namely the space time singularity of the point spacetime theory,\nindeed as the point no longer exists.\nIt can be argued that the space time generally used in Classical theory and\nQuantum Theory is an approximation, which smoothens out an underpinning\nchaotic behavior at the Planck scale [23, 24]. Indeed as Wheeler himself observed, \"No prediction of space time, therefore no meaning for space time is\nthe verdict.... That object which is central to all of classical general relativity,\nthe four dimensional space time geometry, simply does not exist, except in\na classical approximation.... One has to forego that view of nature in which\nevery event, past, present, or future, occupies its preordained position in a\ngrand catalog called \"space time\"....\"[1]. This approximate classical space\ntime is quasi- changeless or stationary and time is reversible, as indeed is\nevident from the equations of motion both in Classical Physics and Quantum Physics. But when we go beyond this approximation, to the stochastic\ndescription at the Planck scale [23] time is no longer reversible. We make\nthe leap from the age old concept of \"being\" to the concept of \"becoming\"\nat least at this scale.\nOne of the criticisms put forward against the Planck Scale Phenomena is that\nthese effects are beyond experimental verification for a long time to come.\nBut let us analyse this further. The Compton scale which we encounter in\nthe physical world has an underpinning of some n = 1040 transient Planck\nparticles. However Planck scale phenomena are moderated, and we have, as\nin a diffusion process,\n\u221a\nl = nlP\n(3)\n\u221a\nm = mP / n\n(4)\nwhere l and m are the Compton wavelength and mass of a typical elementary particle and lP and mP are the Planck length and the Planck mass. An\nequation identical to (3) holds for the Compton time also.\n4\n\n\f(3) and (4) are not mere numerical accidents\n\u221a - they can be deduced as mentioned from a diffusion process [23]. The n in the equations is indicative\nof a Brownian process. For example, in a random walk of n\u221asteps, each of\nlength l, the total distance covered would be of the order of nl.\nInfact we can go one step further. Remembering that there are a total of\nN = 1080 elementary particles, the entire universe shows up as n \u00d7 N = 10120\nPlanck scale oscillators. Using\u221athe fact that the rth energy led for the Harmonic oscillators is given by rh\u0304\u03c9 for large r, [25]\nthat the total\n\u221a it follows\n2\nenergy of these Planck scale oscillators would be nNmP c , which correctly\ngives the mass of the universe itself. That is, the universe is a normal mode\nof these Planck scale oscillators.\nWe have already remarked that the Quantum commutators are present in\n(1), if we neglect terms of the order of a2 . In particular, taking a to be\nthe Compton scale, it has been shown that we can recover from (1) and\n(2) the Dirac equation itself[11]. This again is not surprising because the\nnon commutativity in (1) and (2) can be shown to represent spin even from\nthe classical viewpoint [26]. Interestingly, at the Compton scale it has been\nshown that the Quantum coordinates coincide with the complex coordinates\nof a classical Kerr-Newman Black Hole with radius of the order of the Compton wavelength. Indeed it has been known for a long time that the classical\nKerr-Newman metric reproduces the field of the electron including the purely\nQuantum Mechanical gyro magnetic ratio g = 2. What has been inexplicable\nis the fact that there is a naked singularity or equivalently complex coordinates. This infact is a direct consequence of the non commutativity [11].\nIn other words once the non commutative or fuzzy nature of spacetime is\ntaken into consideration, corresponding to averages over zitterbewegung in\nRealtivistic Quantum Theory, the naked singularity disappears and the electron can be represented by the Kerr-Newman metric. These conclusions have\nsince been confirmed by Nottale [27]. Already this Kerr-Newman characterization of the Quantum Mechanical electron points to the long sought after\nlinkage between gravitation and electromagnetism [28]. It can be shown formally that this is so [29, 20, 22]. Infact arising from (1) there is the covariant\nderivative\n(5)\n\u2202\u03bc \u2192 \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03c3\u03bc\u03c3\nThe second term on the right of (5) represents the electromagnetic potential,\nand surprisingly coincides with the original Weyl formulation of electromagnetism.\n5\n\n\fSurprising as it may seem there is a cosmological scheme which follows from\nthese considerations. It can be understood on the \u221a\nbasis of the fact that in\nthe minimum time interval \u03c4 at the Compton scale , N particles are created\nfluctuationally from the Quantum vacuum, where N is the number of particles present at that epoch [30, 31, 32]. This cosmology successfully predicted\ndark energy and an accelerating ever expanding universe since confirmed by\nobservation [33, 34].\nAll this can also be shown to explain some hitherto inexplicable coincidences\nnoted by Weyl, Eddington, Dirac and Weinberg. These are relations like\n\u221a\nR = Nl\n(6)\n\u221a\ne2\nN\n=\nGm2\nm=\n\nh\u03042 H\nGc\n\n!1/3\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nand others. R is the radius of the universe, e is the electron charge, G the\nuniversal constant of gravitation, c the velocity of light, h\u0304 the reduced Planck\nconstant and H the Hubble constant. It is easy and even unscientific to dismiss such equations as accidents. Dirac himself realised that equations (6)\nand (7) for example could have a cosmological significance [35]. There was\nan inconsistency in his otherwise beautiful cosmology. More recently it has\nbeen shown by the author that these coincidental equations (8) can be deduced, on the basis of the cosmology mentioned above. It may be mentioned\nthat Weinberg had termed the equation (8) as being mysterious because it\nrelates a large scale parameter like H, the Hubble constant to microphysical\nconstants [36]. This points to a Machian or \"co-related\" universe which is\nnot surprising because the universe as we have just seen, is a normal mode\nof Planck oscillators.\nIn this consistent scheme, the universe is created out of a sub stratum Quantum vaccuum or dark energy, in a phase transition at the Planck scale [37].\nHerein are the very first seeds for all the complex structures of the universe.\n\n3\n\nA Mass Spectrum\n\nWe can extend these considerations to generate a mass spectrum, a problem\nthat has fascinated El Naschie and for which his model gives a solution [38].\n6\n\n\fWe now use the model of three oscillators (typically for the three quarks),\ndiscussed in detail in references [39, 40, 11, 41]. We use the fact that for such\nan oscillator (resembling a triatomic molecule) [42] the frequencies are given\nby\nq\nq\n\u03c9 = k/m, 2 k/m\n(9)\n\nfor one and two such oscillators where h\u0304\u03c9 = mc2 , m being the mass.\nFor reasons discussed in detail in the references, we take the higher frequency\nor mass to represent the pion m\u03c0 . In this connection, it may be mentioned\nthat the \u03c0 0 meson has been shown to be a bound state of an electron and\npositron in the discrete spacetime theory [11], borne out by its decay mode.\nThis was a starting point for El Naschie in his mass spectrum model. Then\nfrom (9) we derive the mass spectrum from the oscillator energy levels viz.,\n1\nm \u2248 (n + )m\u03c0 , m \u2248 (2n + 1)m\u03c0 , n = 0, 1, 2, * * *\n2\n\n(10)\n\nIt is remarkable that the formula (10) generates a whole range of some 50\nmesons and baryons including the well known particles from the particle\ndata group tables (Cf.refs.[43]), starting from the Kmeson (480meV approximately) through several other mesons including the 2\u03c7, D, f, \u03c1, \u0398 and so on\nas also the very massive \u03b3(1s), \u03c71p, \u03b32s, \u03b33s, \u03b34s, \u03b310860, B, J/(\u03c81s) and so\non, going right up to values of n near 80 giving the heaviest of the particles\nand clusters of masses nearby. Even in the approximation (10) where several\ndegrees of freedom and other details have been excluded, the agreement is\nwithin a few percent of the actual values. Interestingly the latest particle\nD5 (2317) [44] also follows from (10), being apprxomately 17m\u03c0 . Incidentally\nEl Naschie's mass spectrum can also start with the model of spring connected\noscillators [38].\n\nReferences\n[1] C.W. Misner, K.S. Thorne and J.A. Wheeler, \"Gravitatioin\", W.H.
