Accurate measurements of the parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms is one of the most promising\nways of exploring this path. It culminated in very precise\nmeasurements of the PNC in cesium [2]. Interpretation of\nthe measurements based on accurate atomic calculations\nled to perfect agreement with the standard model and\nput strong constrains on any new physics beyond it [3, 4]\n(see also review [1] for more detailed discussion). First\nunambiguous measurement of the nuclear P-odd anapole\nmoment was also reported in the Cs PNC experiment [2].\nAt present, the study of symmetry violations in atoms\nand molecules goes mostly in three major directions (see,\ne.g. [5]): (i) the PNC measurements for a chain of isotopes; (ii) the measurements of nuclear anapole moments;\nand (iii) the measurements of the P,T-odd permanent\nelectric dipole moments of atoms and molecules. Interpretation of the anapole moment and EDM measurements requires sophisticated atomic or molecular calculations. The calculations are difficult and sometimes\ndisagree with each other. For example, the calculations of the thallium electric dipole moment (EDM) by\nNataraj et al [6] and by Sahoo et al [7] disagree with earlier calculations [8, 9], calculations of the nuclear spindependent PNC in cesium by Mani and Angom [10] disagree with earlier calculations [11\u201314], etc. The difficulties are mostly due to the strong inter-electron correlations which need to be treated to all orders of the\nmany-body perturbation theory. Majority of publications present the effect of one particular P- or CP-odd\ninteraction for a specific atom or a molecule. If another\nweak interaction Hamiltonian is considered, the calculations are to be done again.\n\nThe extraction of the nuclear anapole moment from\nthe PNC measurements for thallium [15] also presents a\nproblem. The analysis of the experimental data based\non atomic calculations favors a negative value for the\nthallium anapole moment [15, 16] while all nuclear calculations produce positive values [17].\nSince the analysis based on sophisticated atomic calculations is very complicated it is important to have additional tools which may help to check the calculations\nfor consistency or even avoid the calculations. In present\npaper we build such tools by studying the relations between matrix elements for different symmetry-breaking\noperators. We show that using these relations the result\nfor a specific operator can be easily obtained analytically\nif the calculations for another operator are available. The\nrelations can also be used to check different calculations\nfor consistency. Additional benefit comes from the need\nto separate the effects of different sources to the PNC or\nEDM of atoms or molecules in the analysis of the experimental data. Recent measurement of T and P violation\nin YbF molecule [18] combined with the Tl EDM measurement [19] would allow to obtain independent limits\non electron EDM and CP-violating interaction. However,\nthe relative sign of these contributions is different in different calculations [9, 20]. This sign problem is solved in\nthe present work by calculating the ratio of the matrix\nelements. Then independent limits on electron EDM and\nscalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd interaction is presented.\nThere is an active search for the CP-violating permanent EDM of polar molecules, such as YbF [18],\nPbO [21, 22], ThO [23], etc. Interpretation of the\nmeasurements requires complicated molecular calculations. Most of calculations consider only one possible\nsource of the molecular EDM: electron EDM or scalarpseudoscalar CP-odd interaction. We show that the analytical ratios of the matrix elements provide reliable link\nbetween molecular EDMs caused by different sources.\nTherefore, if calculations exist for a particular CP-odd\n\n\f2\noperator, no new calculations are needed to find an EDM\ncaused by a different operator.\nThe approach developed in this paper is easy to apply\nwhen matrix elements of the symmetry-breaking operator between s1/2 and p1/2 single-electron states strongly\ndominate over other matrix elements. This is the case for\nthe PNC amplitudes between atomic s-states and for the\nEDM of atoms and molecules caused by electron EDM\nor scalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd weak interaction. We also\nuse this approach for the thallium anapole sign problem.\nII.

However, we can start for simplicity from\nan atom with one external electron above closed shells\nkeeping in mind cesium atom as an example. Then in\nthe lowest order of the perturbation theory in residual\nCoulomb interaction the PNC amplitude and the EDM\nof the atom are given by (1) and (2) in which states a,\nb and n are single electron (e.g. Hartree-Fock) states. It\nis easy to see that all single-electron matrix elements of\nweak interaction are proportional to each other. Indeed,\nonly short distances contribute to the value of the matrix elements (see appendix for analytical estimations).\nThese distances are r < rN for the PNC interactions\nand for the scalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd interaction (RN\nis nuclear radius) and r \u2264 a0 /Z for the electron EDM operator (a0 is Bohr radius). On these distances the energy\nof the single-electron state can be neglected compared to\nthe nuclear potential \u2212Ze2 /r and Dirac equations for all\nsingle-electron states become identical. The only difference comes from the normalization of the states. Suppose\nwe have two different operators of, say, CP -odd weak in\u2032\nteraction HCP and HCP\n.

Furthermore,\nif the s1/2 \u2212 p1/2 matrix elements of the weak interaction\nstrongly dominate over other matrix elements then the\nproportionality is not affected by the many-body effects.\nIndeed, if other weak matrix elements are neglected then\nany many-body expression is a sum of terms with one\ns1/2 \u2212 p1/2 weak matrix element in each term. Since all\nof them are proportional with the same proportionality\ncoefficient R the proportionality would hold for the sum\nas well.\nTable I shows the ratios of the h6s1/2 |HW |6p1/2 i matrix elements for cesium atom for different P-odd and\nCP-odd operators of weak interaction HW in the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approximation and with\ndominating many-body effects included. The ratios are\ncompared with the analytical result presented in the appendix. The many-body effects include core polarization\n(CP) and Brueckner-type correlations. Core polarization\ncan be understood as the change of the self-consistent\ncore potential due to the effect of an external field (weak\ninteraction in our case). Its inclusion above the HartreeFock level is often called the random-phase approximation (RPA). Brueckner-type correlations are the correlations which can be reduced to a redefinition of the singleelectron orbitals, replacing the Hartree-Fock ones by the\nBrueckner orbitals (BO) [24]. In both cases of the P-odd\nand CP-odd weak interactions the ratios of the matrix\nelements are stable within the 1-2% accuracy while the\nmatrix elements change by up to two times.\n\nIII.\n\nPARITY NON-CONSERVATION\n\nHamiltonian describing parity-nonconserving electronnuclear interaction can be written as a sum of spinindependent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) parts (we use\n\n\f3\natomic units: ~ = |e| = me = 1):\nHPNC = HSI + HSD\n\u0011\nGF \u0010 QW\n\u03ba\n= \u221a \u2212\n\u03b35 + \u03b1I \u03c1(r),\n2\nI\n2\n\nIt is convenient to present the amplitude in a compact\nform\n\nwhere GF \u2248 2.2225 \u00d7 10\u221214 a.u. is the Fermi constant\nof the\u0012weak interaction,\nQW\nweak charge,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 is the nuclear\n0 \u2212I\n0 \u03c3\nare Dirac matriand \u03b35 =\n\u03b1 =\n\u2212I 0\n\u03c3 0\nces, I is the nuclear spin, and \u03c1(r) is the nuclear density normalized to 1. The strength of the spin-dependent\nPNC interaction is proportional to the dimensionless constant \u03ba which is to be found from the measurements.\nThere are three major contributions to \u03ba arising from\n(i) electromagnetic interaction of atomic electrons with\nnuclear anapole moment [25], (ii) electron-nucleus spindependent weak interaction [26] , and (iii) combined effect of the spin-independent weak interaction and the\nmagnetic hyperfine interaction [27] (see, also review [1]).\nIn this work we do not distinguish between different contributions to \u03ba and present the results in terms of total\n\u03ba which is the sum of all possible contributions.\nWithin the standard model the weak nuclear charge\nQW is given by [28]\nQW \u2248 \u22120.9877N + 0.0716Z.\n\n(5)\n\nHere N is the number of neutrons, Z is the number of\nprotons.\nThe PNC amplitude of an electric dipole transition\nbetween states of the same parity |ii \u2261 |Ji Fi Mi i and\n|f i \u2261 |Jf Ff Mf i is equal to:\nX \u0014 hf |d|nihn|HPNC |ii\nPNC\nE1f i\n=\nEi \u2212 En\nn\n\u0015\nhf |HPNC |nihn|d|ii\n,\n(6)\n+\nEf \u2212 En\nP\nwhere d = \u2212e i ri is the electric dipole operator, and\nF = I + J is the total angular momentum.\nApplying the Wigner-Eckart theorem we can express\nthe amplitudes via reduced matrix elements\n\u0012\n\u0013\nFf 1 Fi\nFf \u2212Mf\nE1PNC\n=\n(\u22121)\nfi\n\u2212Mf q Mi\n\u00d7 hJf Ff ||dPNC ||Ji Fi i.\n\n(7)\n\nDetailed expressions for the reduced matrix elements of\nthe SI and SD PNC amplitudes can be found e.g. in\nRefs.

All\nother parameters are given by analytical expressions.\nThe c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 and C parameters are just angular coefficients. The ratios r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 can also be approximated\nby analytical expressions which will be discussed below.\nThe expression (14) can be further simplified in an\nimportant case of an ns \u2212 n\u2032 s transition (e.g. the 6s-7s\ntransition in Cs). On a few per cent level of accuracy the\ns \u2212 p3/2 matrix elements of the SD PNC interaction can\nbe neglected [32]. This means that r2 = r4 = 0. We also\nhave r1 = r3 = r and (16) is reduced to\nR=r\n\nc1 S1 /S2 + c3\n.\nC(S1 /S2 + 1)\n\n(17)\n\nA.\n\nExperimental values for the two different hfs components of the parity non-conserving 6s \u2212 7s transition in\ncesium are [2]\nEPNC (6sF =4 \u2212 7sF =3 ) = 1.6349(80) mV/cm,\nEPNC (6sF =3 \u2212 7sF =4 ) = 1.5576(77) mV/cm.\n\nc1 S1 /S2 + c3\n\u03ba\n. (18)\nC(S1 /S2 + 1) (\u2212QW )\n\nQW is the weak nuclear charge. As in (14) the only\nparameter which comes from numerical calculations is\nthe ratio S1 /S2 . On the other hand, knowing the value of\nR for at least two hfs components of the PNC transition\nis sufficient for extraction of \u03ba from the measurements.\n\n(19)\n\nTo extract \u03ba we use (13) and calculate R for these\ntwo transitions using (18). To do so we note that\nJf = Ji = Jn = 1/2, QW =-73.19 (see Eq.(5)) and take\nS1 /S2 = \u22120.3459 from Ref. [33]. This leads to the system\nof equations\nE(1 + 0.06739\u03ba) = 1.6349(80),\nE(1 \u2212 0.05937\u03ba) = 1.5576(77).\n\n(20)\n\nThe solution for \u03ba is \u03ba=0.382(56). This result is in good\nagreement with the values \u03ba=0.393(56) from Ref. [11]\nand \u03ba=0.375(56) from Ref. [12]1 . Accurate calculations\nsimilar to what is reported in our previous work for Ba+ ,\nYb+ and Ra+ [32] lead to the value \u03ba = 0.376 which\nis in perfect agreement with the all-order calculations of\nRef. [12]. This is an illustration of the accuracy of the\nanalysis based on the ratio of the matrix elements. The\nvalue \u03ba=0.382 coming from this analysis differs by less\nthan 2% from the value \u03ba=0.376 coming from the accurate calculations. This difference is due to two simplifications: (a) neglecting the s \u2212 p3/2 matrix elements of\nthe SD weak interaction, and (b) assuming that the ratio\nof the matrix elements is the same for all single-electron\nstates.\nRecent relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of the\nnuclear spin-dependent PNC in Cs [10] report the values of the SD PNC matrix elements which are about\n30% smaller than those of the all-order calculations of\nRef. [12]. This is in disagreement not only with this\nwork but with all earlier calculations of the SD PNC in\ncesium [11\u201314]. Given the proportionality of the matrix\nelements of the SI and SD weak interactions discussed\nabove, the results of Ref. [10] are also in disagreement\nwith all most accurate calculations of the SI PNC in cesium (see, e.g. [3, 4, 33]). The latter calculations have\naccuracy better than 0.5% and are used to test the Standard Model in Cs PNC experiment [2] where the accuracy is 0.35 %.\nB.\n\nSubstituting r from (A10) leads to\nR = 4.90(1 \u2212 0.073Z 2\u03b12 )\n\nPNC in cesium\n\nAnapole moment of thallium\n\nThe value of the nuclear anapole moment of thallium,\nextracted from the measurements of the PNC in the\n\n1\n\nRefs.[11] and [12] use different definition of \u03ba.

[17]).\nThe analysis of the experimental data based on simple single-electron approximations gives the value \u03baa =\n\u22120.22 \u00b1 0.30 [15]. The analysis based on sophisticated\nmany-body calculations gives very close value of \u03baa =\n\u22120.26 \u00b1 0.27 [16]. On the other hand, the \"best value\"\nobtained in nuclear calculations is \u03baa = 0.24 [17]. To\nextract the sign of \u03baa from the experiment one needs the\nrelative sign of SI and SD amplitudes. Here we show\nthat simple analysis with the use of the analytical ratio\nof the matrix elements of the weak interactions supports\nthe findings of Refs.[15, 16] leaving the problem of sign\ndisagreement unsolved.\nIf we keep only s1/2 \u2212 p1/2 matrix elements of the weak\ninteraction for both SI and SD interactions, then the general expression (16) can be reduced to\nR(F, F \u2032 ) = r\n\nc(F, F \u2032 )\n,\nC(F, F \u2032 )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere r is one of the ratios ri (15) which corresponds\nto the s1/2 \u2212 p1/2 weak matrix elements, c(F, F \u2032 ) and\nC(F, F \u2032 ) are corresponding angular coefficients.

Factor 2 in the\ndefinition of WS (26) is absent in some of the papers.\nMost of the calculations of the molecular EDM include only one of the CP-odd effects: that of the electron EDM or the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction. We\nuse the relations between the matrix elements of the two\nCP-odd Hamiltonians to fill the gaps in the table. Corresponding results are shown in bold. For example, according to Ref. [34] the effect of electron EDM in the YbF\nmolecule is Wd = \u221215 \u00d7 1024 Hz/e cm. Using the ratio\nWd /Wc = 114 \u00d7 1018 /e cm for Yb+ from Table III we\nfound that the effect of the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction is Wc = \u2212132 kHz.\n\nviolating interaction.

(28)\nIn fact, there are other contributions from the CP-odd\nelectron-nucleus interactions. Here we consider only the\nscalar-pseudoscalar interaction (A11). Other contributions should be small due to the constrains obtained from\nthe EDM measurements for mercury [43]. Using data\nfrom Table III one can rewrite (27,28) as\nde + 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221220 C SP =\n(6.9 \u00b1 7.4) \u00d7 10\u221228 e cm,\nYbF :\nde + 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221221 C SP =\n(\u22122.4 \u00b1 5.7 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10\u221228 e cm.\nTl :\n\nRecent measurement of T and P violation in YbF\nmolecule [18] combined with the Tl EDM measurement [19] and the data from Table III allows to obtain\nindependent limits on the electron EDM and the CP-\n\n(30)\n\nSolving these equations for de and C SP leads to\nde = (\u22122.8 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10\u221227 e cm,\nC SP = (3.0 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nThe limit (31) for de is significantly weaker than those\npresented in (27) and (28). This is because the values\nof the ratios of the matrix elements of the two operators\nare very close for Tl and Yb (see Table III). The most\nfortunate case leading to strongest limits for de and C SP\nwould correspond to very different values of the ratio,\npreferably with the different sign. However, the formulas\n(A15) and (A13) and the data in Table III show that this\nis not possible. The ratio is always positive and slowly\ndecrease with Z. A slightly different value of the ratio\nshould be expected for the EDM of radium in the excited\nmetastable 7s6d 3 D2 state. The EDM of radium in this\nstate is strongly enhanced [44] due to proximity of the\n7s7p 3 P1o state (the energy interval is \u223c 5 cm\u22121 ) and\nis proportional to the h7p3/2 |HCP |6d3/2 i matrix element\nof the CP-odd interaction HCP . However, the value of\nthis matrix element is strongly dominated by the core\npolarization effect which in turn is mostly due to the\ns1/2 \u2212 p1/2 matrix elements between core and excited\nstates. Therefore, the ratio of the two contributions is\nnot very different from what was considered above for Tl\nand YbF.\nC.\n\nB. Extraction of the electron EDM and the\nparameter of the scalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd\ninteraction from the EDM measurements for YbF\nand Tl\n\n(29)\n\nEDM of Tl and Fr\n\nEDM of thallium due to electron EDM and scalarpseudoscalar CP-odd interaction was recently calculated\nin our paper [9]. The ratio of the two contributions\nwas found to be 83de /(C SP 10\u221218 e cm) which is in\ngood agreement with the analytical result of this paper: Wd /Wc = 89/(10\u221218e cm). The EDM enhancement factor is \u2212582 [9] which is in very good agreement with the value \u2212585 found in earlier calculations\n\n\f7\nby Liu and Kelly [8]. The EDM enhancement factor\nfor thallium was also calculated in more recent work of\nRef. [6] and found to be -466 (dTl = \u2212466de ) which is\nabout 25% smaller than the results mentioned above.\nThe EDM of thallium due to the scalar-pseudoscalar\nCP-odd interaction calculated by the same group earlier\n(dTl = \u22124.06 \u00d7 10\u221218 C SP e cm [7]) is also smaller than\nin other calculations of Ref. [9] and [20]. On the other\nhand, the ratio of the two contributions is 115 (in units\nof de /(C SP 10\u221218 e cm)) which is significantly larger than\nthe analytical and numerical values of 89 and 83 (same\nunits, see Table III).\nEDM enhancement factor for francium was calculated\nin Ref. [49] and found to be 910(46): d(Fr) = 910(46)de .\nThis value is in good agreement with the value of 894.93\nfound in more recent calculations [50]. Using the value\nd(Fr) = 910(46)de and the ratio of the electron-EDM matrix element to the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction presented in Table III we can now reconstruct another contribution to the EDM of francium:\nd(Fr) = 11 \u00d7 10\u221218 C SP e cm.\n\n(33)\n\nIt is interesting to note that the calculation of the nuclear spin-dependent PNC amplitude between hyperfine\ncomponents of the ground state of francium presented\nin Ref. [29] involves the same sum as the expression\n(2) for the EDM of the atom. Therefore, we can reconstruct the EDM enhancement factor for Fr using the\nresults of Ref. [29] and proportionality between matrix\nelements of the nuclear spin-dependent interaction (A9)\nand the electron EDM operator (A15). This leads to\nd(Fr) = 854de which is in good agreement with the value\nd(Fr) = 910(46)de of Ref. [49]. This is a good consistency\ntest of both calculations.\nReading the papers citing our works (see, e.g. [6, 50])\nreveals the need to clear some points about our method\nof calculations. For example, the atomic electric field interacting with electron EDMs is calculated in [9] and [49]\nas a derivative of the total potential which includes both\nnuclear and electron parts. The formula E = Zer/r3\nfor the leading contribution to the atomic electric field\npresented on first page of [49] may make an impression\nthat only nuclear field is included. However, the formula\n(2) few lines below clearly includes screening functions\nQ(r) and P (r) for both the nuclear Coulomb and the\nexternal electric field. By the way, the inclusion of the\nelectron electric field change the matrix elements of the\nelectron EDM for thallium by 0.4% only. This is because\nmain contribution comes from short distances where the\nelectron electric field is small since the electron potential\nrapidly tends to a constant inside the 1s orbital. Therefore, we include only nuclear electric field in the analytical analysis (formula (A15) in the appendix) while\nkeeping both contributions in the numerical calculations.\nThe authors of [6] claim that atomic core is strongly\ncontracted in the V N \u22123 starting approximation used in\nour calculations [9]. In fact, it is not. Fig.1 shows the outermost 5d5/2 core function of Tl calculated in the V N \u22123\n\nFIG. 1: The 5d5/2 core function of Tl calculated in V N\u22123\n(solid line) and V N\u22121 (dashed line) approximations.\n\nand V N \u22121 approximations. The difference between the\nfunctions is very small. This is due to the fact that the\nvalence 6s and 6p electrons are located outside of atomic\ncore. Their charge distribution creates almost constant\npotential and no electric field inside the sphere where all\ninner electrons are located. Therefore, the valence electrons have practically no effect on the core wave functions (see [45] for a detailed discussion). The change is\neven smaller for other core functions. The core functions\nenter the configuration interaction (CI) Hamiltonian via\ncore potential Vcore to which all core electrons contribute\n(from 1s to 5d). The difference for Vcore in the V N \u22123\nand V N \u22121 approximations is very small [45]. Moreover,\nthe corresponding corrections to the configuration interaction (CI) Hamiltonian have been included in [9] using\nthe many-body perturbation theory approach.\nAs it is well known, the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian do\nnot depend on the basis one uses. The valence states are\nindeed different in the V N \u22123 and V N \u22121 approximations.\nHowever, this should have no effect on the final results\nas long as the saturation of the basis for valence states is\nachieved. There are only two conditions the basis states\nmust satisfy: (a) they must be orthogonal to the core,\nand (b) they must constitute a complete set of states.\nTherefore, it does not matter whether valence states are\ncalculated in the V N \u22123 or V N \u22121 potential or by any other\nmethod (e.g., a popular basis \u03c8n (r) = rn \u03c80 (r) [46]), the\nfinal results should be the same. If there is any difference in the results, the most likely reason for this is the\nincompleteness of the basis set.\nIn spite of no difference in final results there is a good\nreason for the use of the V N \u22123 approximation \u2013 the simplicity and good convergence of the many-body pertur-\n\n\f8\nbation theory (MBPT) for the core-valence correlations.\nThis is the only approximation which has no subtraction\ndiagrams [47]. To be more precise, we should state that\nthe condition for the absence of the subtraction diagrams\nis that the potential used to calculate single-electron core\nstates and the potential of the core in the CI Hamiltonian\nare exactly the same. In the case of thallium atom treated\nas a three-valence-electrons system this corresponds to\nthe V N \u22123 approximation. When any other approximation is used one has to include the subtraction diagrams.\nLarge energy denominators suppress the value of the\ncorrelation terms in the V N \u22123 approximation ensuring\ngood convergence of the MBPT [45]. There must be large\ncancelation between subtraction and other diagrams to\nensure the same final results if any other initial approximation is used. This is very similar to the well known\nfact that the Hartree-Fock basis is the best choice for any\nMBPT calculations. Zero-order results might be better\nin some other approximation, however, strong cancelation between subtraction and other diagrams would lead\nto poor convergence of the MBPT.\nThe authors of [6] claim that the major drawback of\nour work [9] is the inclusion of the core-valence correlations in the second order only. However, the correlations\nbetween the valence electrons and core electrons below\nthe 6s state are small which is evident from the fact that\ntheir inclusion change the EDM of Tl by 3% only [9].\nTherefore, only the correlations between three valence\nelectrons should be treated to all orders. This is done\nin [9] to a very high precision using the CI technique.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have demonstrated the proportionality relations between the nuclear-spin dependent and spinindependent PNC effects in atoms and the scalarpseudoscalar and the electron EDM contributions to the\nEDM of atoms and molecules. The relations are given\nby the simple analytical formulas and can be used to\nexpress one symmetry breaking effect through another.\nUsing these relations and accurate calculations of the\nspin-independent PNC we have confirmed earlier interpretations of the nuclear anapole measurements in cesium\nand thallium. We have also confirmed the ratio of the\nscalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd and electron EDM contributions to the EDM of Cs, Tl and other atoms and some\npolar molecules. Using the relations we found the scalarpseudoscalar contribution to the EDM of francium atom\nand the scalar-pseudoscalar and electron EDM contributions to the EDM of many polar molecules. Using experimental limits on EDMs of thallium and YbF we found\nmodel-independent limits on the electron EDM and the\nconstant of the scalar-pseudoscalar CP-odd interaction.\n\nAcknowledgments.\n\nThe authors are grateful to E.

Following Ref. [51]\nwe assume uniform distribution of electric charge inside\na sphere of radius RN . Taking formulas for the s1/2 and\np1/2 wave functions from Ref. [51] and keeping terms up\nto Z 2 \u03b12 we come to the following expressions\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nfs (x) = As x 1 \u2212 Z 2 \u03b12 x2 ,\n8\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nx\nx2\ngs (x) = \u2212As Z\n1\u2212\n,\n(A2)\n2\n5\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx2\nx2\nfp1/2 (x) = Ap Z\u03b12\n1\u2212\n,\n2\n5\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\ngp1/2 (x) = Ap x 1 \u2212 Z 2 \u03b12 x2 .\n8\nHere x = r/RN , RN is nuclear radius. As and Ap are\nnormalization factors. They can be found by matching\n(A2) to atomic wave functions at short distances outside\nof the nucleus (see, e.g. [52]).

Note that normalization factors (A3) are needed only to compare the matrix elements\nof the electron EDM to other matrix elements. For cases\nnot involving electron EDM there is exact cancellation of\nthe normalization factors.
