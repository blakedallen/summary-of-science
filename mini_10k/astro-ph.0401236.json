The demonstration by COBE that about half of the radiant energy\nreleased in the universe since decoupling comes to us in the submm/far\u2013IR\nhas further underscored the scientific necessity of observations in this wavelength regime [8, 4, 5]. The next decade promises even greater discoveries, as\nnew observatories and detectors are still pushing toward fundamental limits.\nThe paper briefly outlines some of the exciting capabilities and scientific roles\nof new single-dish far\u2013IR \u2013 mm-wave telescopes and their instruments.\n\n2 Detector technologies\nOver the past decade, one of the most important developments for far\u2013\nIR through mm\u2013wave astrophysics has been the push toward large\u2013format\ndirect\u2013detector arrays. There are two key reasons why large arrays are important: (1) they provide a wider instantaneous field\u2013of\u2013view, thereby increasing\nthe mapping speed; (2) they also allow better rejection of the \"sky noise\" due\nto atmospheric emissivity fluctuations, which is correlated across the array,\nand thereby provide better per\u2013pixel sensitivities. Put together, these two\nfactors provide a dramatic improvement in imaging capability.\nFor observations at \u03bb > 200 \u03bcm, bolometers are presently the most useful\ndevices. Over the last 20 years, the mapping speed of bolometer arrays \u2013 equal\nto the ratio of the number of pixels to the square of a single pixel's sensitivity\n\u2013 has been improving at about a factor of two per year (faster than Moore's\nlaw !). Gains have been achieved in both single pixel sensitivity and array\nsize. The individual detector elements are now achieving background-limited\n\n\f2\n\nBradford & Zmuidzinas\n\nperformance for ground\u2013based astronomy or CMB studies, and the number\nof pixels in a typical array is \u2264 400, which is about the practical limit of what\ncan be achieved for individually\u2013wired detectors in a sub-Kelvin focal plane.\nMultiplexing technologies for the next generation of bolometer arrays are\nnow under development by several groups for both CMB studies and submillimeter astronomy. The most ambitious example at present is the SCUBA-2\neffort, slated to deploy 5000 close-packed superconducting transition-edge detectors in each of two (450 \u03bcm and 850 \u03bcm) arrays, to be read out with a\nSQUID-based multiplexer [6, 3]. However, while these technologies are very\npromising, they are in the early phases, and there remains the substantial\ntask of fielding robust, sensitive astronomical instruments at the telescope.\nThe transition from the mm/submm to the far-IR (\u03bb < 200\u03bcm) is a\nshift from ground-based observations to airborne and orbital platforms. The\ndetectors of choice thus far have been the Ge:Ga photoconductors, which\nhave flight heritage, require only modest cryogenic infrastructure (T\u223c1.5 K),\nand can be naturally employed in large-format arrays using cryogenic CMOS\nmultiplexers. These detectors arrays are the heart of the MIPS instrument\non SIRTF (32\u00d732 at 70\u03bcm, 2\u00d720 at 160\u03bcm) and the PACS instrument on\nHerschel (16\u00d725 at 90\u03bcm & 160\u03bcm), and will offer the most sensitive observations in the far-IR to date. Nevertheless, substantial room for improvement exists even at these shorter wavelengths: array construction is still very\nlabor\u2013intensive, which limits the array size, especially for stressed detectors\nat \u03bb > 100 \u03bcm; the quantum efficiencies are still relatively low; and the temporal response of these detectors requires sophisticated calibration protocols.\nCoherent detection technology has also achieved impressive gains, driven\nby the needs of projects such as HIFI/Herschel and ALMA. Sensitive superconducting tunnel junction (SIS) mixers now operate up to 1.25 THz\n(240 \u03bcm), while superconducting hot\u2013electron bolometer (HEB) mixers push\nto higher frequencies still, beyond 2.5 THz (120 \u03bcm). The improvements in\nlocal oscillator technology have been even more dramatic, especially the solid\u2013\nstate amplifier/multiplier chains developed for HIFI/Herschel, which are now\ncapable of continuous tuning over > 100 GHz bandwidths and provide ample power for pumping SIS mixers at 1.25 THz and HEB mixers at 1.6 THz.\nThese developments will revolutionize high\u2013resolution terahertz spectroscopy,\nespecially using airborne (SOFIA) and space (Herschel) platforms.\n\n3 New single-dish facilities\nA major initiative for the submillimeter / millimeter astrophysics community\nin the next decade is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). ALMA\nwill be an inteferometric array of 64 12-meter antennas operating in the 230,\n345, 460, 650, and 850 GHz atmospheric windows, and will be a very powerful instrument in these frequency bands with its unique combination of high\n\n\fFuture Far-IR / Submm Single-Dish Capabilities\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

While future observatories must carefully consider their role in this context, the development\nof large\u2013format cameras \u2013 one of the major technological trends over the\npast decade \u2013 offers powerful new capabilities for single\u2013dish observatories.\nWhile not widely appreciated, it is in fact possible for future single-dish facilities equipped with wide\u2013field direct\u2013detector cameras to be competitive with\nALMA in terms of absolute point\u2013source continuum sensitivity, and orders\nof magnitude faster than ALMA for wide\u2013field imaging, thereby securing a\nscientifically important role which is complementary to ALMA.\nConsider the achievable (background-limited) sensitivity of a observatory:\nNEFDBG =\n\nh\u03bd [n\u0304(n\u0304 + 1)]1/2\n,\n\u03b7inst \u03b7tel \u03b7atm Atel (Npol \u2206\u03bd)1/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n\u0304 = \u01ebload \u03b7inst (eh\u03bd/kT \u2212 1)\u22121 is the photon mode occupation number (equivalent to the number of photons per second per Hz of detection\nbandwidth in a single spatial mode arriving at a detector). Although ALMA\nwill offer a tremendous collecting area, single\u2013dish telescopes can offer improvements in all the other factors appearing in Eq. (1). A reduction of the\natmospheric opacity improves the sensitivity twice \u2013 in increasing the transmission (\u03b7atm ) and in reducing the background load (\u01ebload ). The telescope\nefficiency \u03b7tel is determined by the antenna surface accuracy according to the\nRuze formula: \u03b7tel \u2248 \u03b70 exp [\u2212(4\u03c0\u01ebrms /\u03bb)2 ]. The ALMA antennas will have\n\u01ebrms \u223c 25 \u03bcm, leaving room for improvement at the high frequencies.\n3.1 Direct-detection continuum observations\nIn addition to the sensitivity improvements that are possible by improving the\ntelescope accuracy and atmospheric conditions, direct-detectors can provide\nadditional sensitivity gains since one can couple both polarizations and the\nfull bandwidth provided by the atmospheric windows. The advantage can be\nsubstantial \u2013 the 650 and 850 GHz windows are each 100 GHz wide, while\nALMA will provide only 4\u20138 GHz instantaneous band. When combined with\nthe efficiency factors, the per pixel sensitivity for a large single-dish telescope\ncan be comparable to that of ALMA.

Raw sensitivities (5\u03c3, 1 hour) are indicated with thin horizontal lines, taken from the references in Table 1, or calculated\nin the photon background limit assuming 50% instrument transmission. Estimates\nof the confusion limit due to extragalactic sources are indicated with thick horizontal lines at the termination of the vertical arrows. The confusion limits are taken to\nbe 5 \u00d7 the flux density at which there is 1 source per beam according to the source\nmodels of Blain et al. [1]. For instruments which are not confusion-limited in 100\nhours, the 5\u03c3, 100 hour sensitivity is plotted. Upward arrows imply measurements\nwhich are confusion-limited in less than 1 hour, downward arrows the converse.

In the short\nsubmillimeter windows, the 10\u201315 meter class telescopes at excellent sites\n(APEX, ASTE, SPT) offer continuum sensitivities within a factor of 2\u20135 of\n\n\fFuture Far-IR / Submm Single-Dish Capabilities\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

The fiducial A25 telescope, a 25\u2013meter with \u01ebrms = 12\u03bcm at a very\ndry site would be 2\u20135 times more sensitive than ALMA in these windows.\nLarge format direct-detector arrays allow rapid surveys\nWhile the point source sensitivity of a large single-dish telescope can approach\nthat of ALMA at the highest frequencies, the real advantage for single-dish\ntelescopes is the tremendous mapping speed afforded by large-format focal\nplane arrays. As pointed out above, the mapping speed scales as the instantaneous solid angle and the inverse square of the sensitivity. To get a\nuseful measure of survey speed, we convert the mapping speed to a galaxy\ndetection rate, using power-law extrapolations to the observed source counts\nin a manner similar to [1]. As the estimates presented in Table 2 show, a\nsingle-dish telescope with a large detector array is much more efficient than\nALMA for discovering the sources that make up the IR background. For\nexample, at 450 \u03bcm, the most likely galaxy to be detected has a flux of a\nfew \u00d710 mJy. ALMA will be capable of detecting about one of these per\nhour, while SCUBA-2 will detect some 20 per hour, and a SCUBA-2 type\narray on the A-25 telescope could detect \u223c 103 galaxies per hour. Of course,\nthis rapid mapping speed provided large-format detector arrays applies to a\nwide range of science topics beyond the survey experiment outlined here.\nSource confusion is a limitation for the 3-meter class telescopes\nA key limitation of continuum surveys using single-dish telescopes is source\nconfusion. When the number of sources in a beam approaches a substantial\nfraction of unity, extraction of fainter flux densities becomes difficult. Figure 1 includes estimates of this limit for the single-dish telescopes with the\nthick horizontal lines. We highlight some key points: 1) SIRTF and Herschel\n\n\f6\n\nBradford & Zmuidzinas\n\nwill be quickly confusion-limited at their longest wavelengths, and the resulting effective sensitivities are insufficient to probe even bright (L = 1012 L\u2299 )\nsources beyond z \u223c 1. 2) Ground-based telescopes can in principle survey\nbright sources to z \u223c 5 in the 350 and 450 \u03bcm windows, but with the existing\nand planned 10\u201315-meter telescopes this will require many tens of hours of\nobservations (of a single field) in good weather, with careful attention paid\nto systematics. The fiducial A-25 telescope would be a factor of 5 more sensitive than the other telescopes at these wavelengths, and yet effectively not\nconfusion-limited because of the smaller beam. 3) At 850 \u03bcm and 1.3 mm,\nthe observed flux density is essentially independent of redshift, and beam\nconfusion limits a 15-meter telescope to only the bright sources, as has been\nfound with SCUBA. In principle, the 50-meter LMT could detect sources\nmore than 10\u00d7 less luminous than its 15-meter counterpart at 850 \u03bcm, but\nfor \u03bb > 1mm, the confusion again prohibits the detection of fainter sources.\n3.2 Far-IR - mm spectroscopy with single-dish telescopes\nALMA will be an exquisite platform for spectroscopy and once commissioned\nwill be the instrument of choice for spectroscopy at known frequencies and\npositions in its operational bands. Nevertheless, there will remain important\nscientific niches for spectroscopy that cannot be addressed with ALMA.\nFull far-IR coverage provided by Herschel and SOIFA\nPerhaps the most important is the full far-IR spectral coverage provided by\nHerschel and SOFIA, which will facilitate ISM studies not possible at other\nwavelengths. With few exceptions, the neutral atomic and ionized gas phases\nare probed with spectral lines at \u03bb < 200\u03bcm, and the optical and near\u2013IR\ntransitions which might be important are typically obscured by dust. Key\ntracers of the molecular phase are also unique to the far-IR: examples include rotational transitions of the light molecular hydrides (e.g. OH, CH,\nHD), mid\u2013 and high\u2013J CO lines which cool excited (T > 100K) molecular gas, and H2 O- a key constituent of the molecular ISM not observable\nfrom the ground. It is impossible to constrain the dense ISM conditions with\nground-based observations alone, and much of our current understanding of\nthese regions is based on far-IR spectroscopy from ariborne and space platforms: COBE, the KAO, ISO and SWAS. As the sensitivity of these observations improves by two or more orders of magnitude in the next decade with\nSIRTF, SOFIA and Herschel, we can anticipate significant advances in our\nunderstanding of the dense ISM phases advances.\nBroad-bandwidth surveys with direct-detection spectrometers\nAnother niche in the context of ALMA's limited bandwidth is the capability\nto couple a large instantaneous band from point sources for spectral surveys.\n\n\fFuture Far-IR / Submm Single-Dish Capabilities\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. Sensitivity provided by spectroscopy platforms in the far-IR and submillimeter. The upward arrows account for the effective sensitivity for line surveys,\nincorporating the time to cover the full atmospheric window for the ground-based\ninstruments, or a 20% band for the SOFIA and Herschel instruments. Thin dashed\ncurves show the intensities of diagnostic fine-structure and CO lines from highredshift galaxies. Sensitivities for the Herschel and SOFIA instruments and ALMA\nare taken from the appropriate web pages, and Zeus and Z-Spec are referenced in\nthe text. The sensitivities of SAFIR and the fiducial A25 telescope are calculated\naccording to the photon noise limit assuming a 25% instrument transmission in a\nsingle polarization. SAFIR's background noise is due to zodiacal light and galactic\ncirrus, taken in regions of low intensity. (Contact author for color version.)\n\nThis is both a means of rapidly measuring several lines simultaneously, and\npotentially as a redshift measurement technique for optically-faint sources.\nThe spectral survey rate increases as the instantaneous bandwidth of instrument, and even from the ground the instantaneous bandwidth can be\n\n\f8\n\nBradford & Zmuidzinas\n\nan order of magnitude larger than the 4\u20138 GHz coupled by ALMA. It can\nbe shown that the most sensitive approach to broad-band spectroscopy of\npoint sources is a low-order grating spectrometer [2], and for the first time\nsuch devices are under development for the submillimeter and millimeter. We\nhighlight ZEUS, an echelle spectrometer for the 350 \u03bcm and 450 \u03bcm windows\nat the JCMT [7] and Z-Spec, a new waveguide grating spectrometer which\ncovers the full 200\u2013300 GHz window instantaneously [2]. In their windows,\nthese ground-based spectrometers are more sensitive than those of Herschel\nand SOFIA because of the aperture size, and should detect diagnostic lines in\nbright sources (L \u223c few \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 ) up to z\u223c3. Furthermore, such instruments\ncombined with the A25 telescope could improve the sensitivity by an order\nof magnitude \u2013 probing the more more typical (L \u223c few \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 ) galaxies.\nPotential of a cold space telescope\nWith Herschel, SOFIA, and the currently\u2013envisioned ground-based spectrometers, we will have the capability to study the ISM conditions in local galaxies,\nand the very brightest galaxies out to redshifts of \u223c 3, but not to the earliest\nepochs of galaxy formation. These platforms are limited by the background\nnoise from the warm telescope itself (and atmosphere). However, dramatic\nimprovements in sensitivity are still possible with a space telescope cooled to\nT < 10 K. As an example, Fig. 2 includes the background-limited sensitivity\nfor SAFIR, a 4 K, 10 meter observatory recommended in the McKee/Taylor\nDecadal Survey report. SAFIR will be an excellent far-IR spectroscopy platform \u2013 capable of detecting spectral lines in a Milky Way\u2013type galaxy to\nredshifts of 5 or more. Note that a spectrometer can readily detect lines\nfrom several sources in the same beam, and thereby offers the potential to\novercome the spatial confusion limit.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n\nA.W.
