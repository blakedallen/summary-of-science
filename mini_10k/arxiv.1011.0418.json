Henson, Itamar Shani, Liron David,\nJulia Narevicius and Edvardas Narevicius\nDepartment of Chemical Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel\nWe present an experimental realization of a moving magnetic trap\ndecelerator, where paramagnetic particles entrained in a cold supersonic beam are\ndecelerated in a co-moving magnetic trap. Our method allows for an efficient\nslowing of both paramagnetic atoms and molecules to near stopping velocities. We\nshow that under realistic conditions we will be able to trap and decelerate a large\nfraction of the initial supersonic beam. We present our first results on deceleration\nin a moving magnetic trap by bringing metastable neon atoms to near rest. Our\nestimated phase space volume occupied by decelerated particles at final velocity of\n50 m/s shows an improvement of two orders of magnitude as compared to currently\navailable deceleration techniques.\nCold chemistry (at temperature of ~1K) is a fast developing field with many\ninteresting theoretical predictions and only a few experiments1-4. It has been predicted\nthat in the cold chemistry regime reactions might proceed through resonance states 5and\nboth reaction rate and path can be controlled6 via external magnetic or electrostatic fields.\nLow temperature chemistry is not limited only to artificially created conditions but occur\nnaturally at the low temperature of interstellar space 7and atmospheres of remote planets\nand moons 8. It is anticipated that cold chemistry will follow the enormous progress in a\nmolecular chemistry that was spurred by the advent of supersonic beams more than half a\ncentury ago 9. However, the progress in the experimental cold chemistry is rather slow\npartly due to the absence of a general method of atomic and molecular cooling. Although\nlow temperature environment created within a supersonic expansion has been used to\nobserve many reactions 10, a direct measurement in a classical crossed beam arrangement\nhas been limited to temperatures of about 20 K 4. We have developed a new method of\nsupersonic beam deceleration that is applicable to paramagnetic species, both atoms and\nmany molecular radicals. Our method is the first implementation of a moving magnetic\ntrap decelerator that enables slowing of paramagnetic species to stopping velocities with\nhigher efficiencies and numbers. Since our method is easily applicable to paramagnetic\natoms we expect that the moving magnetic trap decelerator will make a considerable\nimpact on cold chemistry allowing study of many atom-radical reactions. For example\nmolecular radical reactions with atomic oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen are central both in\nastrophysics 7and combustion chemistry 11.\nMany groups realized the benefits of supersonic expansions as a source of cold\natoms or molecules and a decade ago the first experiments began exploring the possibility\nof controlling the mean velocity of supersonic beams. Different approaches have been\n1\n\n\ftested including kinetic methods of control (mechanical 12 or collisional 13), and methods\nbased on interaction with pulsed electric 14 (applicable to polar molecules with linear\nStark effect), magnetic 15, 16 (applicable to paramagnetic atoms and molecules) and laser\nfields 17. Another method that is also able to cool paramagnetic atoms and molecules is\nthe buffer gas cooling 18. Since high densities of inert buffer gas are needed to thermalize\nthe target atoms or molecules the buffer gas cooling method works the best with atoms\nand molecules with zero orbital angular momentum.\nEfficient deceleration of supersonic beams has been a long-standing goal for\nbeam deceleration methods since barrierless reaction rate constants (usually in the range\nof 10-10-10-13cm3 molecule-1 s-1) place a stringent requirement on reactants density in the\nreaction volume. The problem has been extensively addressed in the Stark effect based\ndeceleration methods. During the deceleration polar molecules are confined in a\ndynamical trap. One must make sure that the longitudinal and transverse degrees of\nfreedom remain decoupled throughout the deceleration process otherwise losses from\nwithin the dynamical trap occur. It has been both suggested 19 and experimentally\nconfirmed that Stark decelerators with dynamical confinement can be operated in a high\norder mode that decouples the longitudinal and transverse motion down to velocities of\n150 m/s 20. At lower velocities the decoupling breaks down and the losses occur from\nwithin the dynamical trap. As a result the phase space volume occupied by decelerating\npolar molecules (acceptance) at 50 m/s approaches the acceptance of the conventional\nStark decelerator which is an order of magnitude lower.\nSince we are interested in the cold chemistry with both atoms and molecules we\nfocus our attention on the Zeeman effect based deceleration performance at low\nvelocities. It has been suggested that the loss problems at low velocities can be overcome\nby decelerating in a co-moving three dimensional magnetic trap 21. Similar approach has\nbeen realized with moving electrostatic traps where a beam of metastable CO molecules\nhas been decelerated in a three dimensional trap formed on a microstructured chip 22, 23\nand recently a deceleration of metastable CO molecules to 140 m/s final velocity has\nbeen demonstrated in a moving macroscopic electrostatic trap 24. Also Rydberg atoms\nhave been decelerated in a moving electrostatic trap 25.\nIn this article we present an experimental realization of a moving magnetic trap\ndecelerator idea that was proposed earlier 21. We show deceleration of metastable Neon\nthat has a mass to magnetic moment ratio similar to atomic oxygen or molecular radicals\nsuch as OH and NH from the initial velocity of 430 m/s to final velocity of 54 m/s\nremoving more than 98 % of initial kinetic energy. We also present a numerical analysis\nof the deceleration process that shows an improvement in the phase space volume\n(acceptance) occupied by the decelerating particles by two orders of magnitude as\ncompared to state of the art Stark decelerator. Finally we show under which conditions\nour decelerator will operate with maximal acceptance and decelerate a beam of\nparamagnetic particles to stopping velocities without loss other than by selection of low\nfield seeking states that are magnetically trappable.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1. Black solid lines are the snapshots of the axial magnetic field as measured during the\nmagnetic trap movement. Trap center moves by 5.2 mm in time steps of 4 \u03bcs. The contour plots\nrepresent the magnetic fields as calculated by finite element simulation.\n\nRecently, Trimeche et. al demonstrated trapping of a supersonic beam in a travelling\nmagnetic wave26.\nThe moving magnetic trap deceleration idea has been inspired by the atom\nconveyor that has been successfully used to transport atoms on micro chips 27 or across\ncentimeter long distances in cold atom experiments 28. Although conceptually similar, in\nour case we need to translate the magnetic trap with far higher velocities. The initial\nvelocity of the moving magnetic trap has to be in the range of a few hundred m/s to\nmatch the initial velocity of a supersonic beam. We also require much higher deceleration\nvalues. In the case of cold atom transport the acceleration stays in the range of 1 m/s2. In\norder to decelerate a supersonic beam from 500 m/s to a full stop in 1 meter a\ndeceleration in excess of 100,000 m/s2 is necessary.\nWe create an effective moving magnetic quadrupole trap potential by constructing\na series of spatially overlapping traps and activating them in a temporally overlapping\npulse sequence. Each trap consists of two coils in an anti-Helmholtz configuration and is\naxially shifted from the next trap by half the coil-to-coil distance. Once the magnetic field\nin a given trap reaches the maximal value we gradually switch the adjacent trap on and\n3\n\n\fshift the magnetic field minimum to its new position in the center of the next trap. The\ncenter-to-center distance between the coils forming a single trap is 10.4 mm with a bore\ndiameter of 10.2 mm. Our configuration is not symmetric; one coil has 16 windings\nwhereas the second coil has 8, both of a 0.46 mm diameter copper wire. Out of 213 traps,\n161 last trap coils are encased in Permendur shells. With a pulsed current peaking at 500\nA the front barrier height exceeds 1 T whereas the back barrier height is 0.4 T (in the lab\nframe). The magnetic field is lower by 20% for the first 52 traps constructed from coils\nthat have no Permendur shell.\nIn Fig. 1 we present measurements of the trap translation (solid lines). We\nmeasure the time and position dependence of the magnetic field using the Faraday effect\n29\n. We insert a 1mm thick terbium gallium garnet crystal, mounted on a translation stage,\ninto the bore of our coils and monitor the rotation of a linearly polarized 532 nm laser\nbeam (spot size 100 um) as we pulse currents through our coils.\nThe overlap time between two consecutive current pulses defines the velocity of\nthe trap at different slowing stages. We change the trap velocity by gradually increasing\nthe overlap time. It includes increasing both the pulse duration and pulse-to-pulse time\ndifference. Each current pulse is formed by an electronic driver which is based on a LCR\ncircuit. In order to control the pulse length, we have designed a \u0091'binary tune box\u0092' (BTB)\nof inductors, which allows us to set the LCR inductance with an accuracy of 1\u03bcH. The\nBTB is composed of 6 inductors (20, 21... 25\u03bcH) connected in series and power transistors\nwhich digitally determine through which of the inductors the current of each quadrupole\ndriver flows. As one can see from Fig. 1 the trap center movement is not smooth and the\nacceleration changes during the trap movement. At a constant velocity of 430 m/s\nparticles experience two opposite sign momentum kicks with a frequency of ~80 kHz.\nSince the perturbation frequency is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the\ncharacteristic frequency of particle motion and the trapping potential is linear with\ncoordinate (quadrupole trap) we can safely treat the motion of a particle in a moving trap\nusing a time averaged potential only 30.\n\n4\n\n\f(B)\n\nz(mm)\n\nx (mm)\n(D)\n\n(C)\n\nVelocity (m/s)\n\nMagnetic field (T)\n\n(A)\n\nx (mm)\n\nz(mm)\nVelocity (m/s)\n\n(E)\n\n(F)\n\nz (mm)\n\nx (mm)\n\nFigure2.(A) solid black line: the time averaged axial magnetic field of a quadrupole trap as\ncalculated by finite element method using experimental parameters (coils without Permendur shell).\nSolid green (red) line: the average effective magnetic potential that includes tilt due to fictitious\nforce, deceleration from 430 to 350 m/s (50 m/s).

(C-F) Longitudinal and transverse phase space distributions along with one\ndimensional separatrices for 350 m/s (C and D) and 50 m/s (E and F) final velocities.\n\nIt is convenient to consider the one dimensional approximation to the deceleration\nprocess by moving into the decelerating frame of reference. The fictitious force modifies\nthe effective potential and adds a term that is linear in the propagation coordinate,\nreducing the height of the \"front\" barrier, as seen in Fig. 2 (A) where we present a\ncanonical magnetic quadrupole trap in both lab and accelerating frames of reference. The\ninitial magnetic field gradient of 160 T/m that we are able to achieve allows us to apply\nhigher decelerations without losing many trapped particles. For example in the case of\nmetastable neon, that has a similar mass to magnetic moment ratio as paramagnetic\nmolecular radicals such as NH or OH in rovibrational ground state, a deceleration of\n83,000 m/s2 adds a negative 90 T/m tilt to the effective magnetic potential as shown by\nthe solid red line in Fig 2 (A). Even at such a high deceleration the \"front\" magnetic field\nbarrier remains at 0.25 T which is equivalent to a decelerating trap with a depth of\n750mK.\n\n5\n\n\f(A)\n\nto pump\nto pump\n\nMCP detector\n213 overlapping traps\nskimmer\nsupersonic\nnozzle\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 3.

(B) Close up view of a section of our decelerator with two overlapping quadrupole\ntraps highlighted with color. Arrow represents the direction of beam propagation.\n\nWe now describe our experimental apparatus as shown in Fig 3. A supersonic\nbeam of Neon is created using an Even-Lavie supersonic valve 31. We demonstrate the\noperation of our decelerator using metastable neon atoms excited by a dielectric barrier\ndischarge32mounted near the orifice of the valve. The long lived 3P2 state of neon has two\nlow field seeking states with mass to magnetic moment ratios of ~7 amu/\u03bcB(mJ=2) and\n~14 amu/\u03bcB(mJ=1), where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. We cool the valve to 74K in order to\nreduce the initial beam velocity. The beam passes a 4 mm diameter skimmer mounted 15\ncm from the valve. The first quadrupole trap is located 29 cm from the valve. The\ndecelerator consists of 213 overlapping quadrupole traps extending for 114 cm. The\nmicro channel plate (MCP) detector is located 1.4 cm from the center of the last trap and\nis mounted on a stage capable of a 5.2 cm translation. We extract the decelerated beam\nvelocities and velocity distributions from time of flight measurements at different\ndetector positions. The 1 cm bore diameter of our magnetic trap coils allows a significant\nsimplification of our experimental setup. We place the quadrupole trap coils outside of\nthe vacuum on a 10 mm diameter Inconel tube with a wall thickness of 0.25 mm. We\nchose Inconel due to its high resistivity that helps to minimize the effect of eddy currents\ninduced by the switching magnetic fields.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4.Time of flight measurements (A) and Monte-Carlo simulation results (B) of supersonic beam\ndeceleration of metastable Neon from an initial velocity of 429.7\u00b16.0 m/s (a\u0096\u2013inset) to final velocities:\nguiding at 432.3\u00b13.6 (b) 352.5\u00b14.2 m/s (c) , 298.6\u00b12.2 m/s (d) , 249.2\u00b11.6m/s (e) , 199.4\u00b11.2 m/s (f),\n148.4\u00b10.8 m/s (g) . Inset: lower final velocities: 97.9\u00b11.0 m/s (h), 76.0\u00b11.6 m/s (i), 53.8\u00b11.1 m/s (j).\nThe simulation was normalized to the data peak area at the final velocity of 97.9 m/s.\n\nWe measure the initial beam mean velocity to be 429.7\u00b16.0 m/s with a standard\ndeviation of 11.2 m/s (trace a in the inset of Fig. 4 A), corresponding to a temperature of\n302mK in the moving frame of reference. In Fig. 4 we present decelerated beam\nintensities measured for different deceleration values. Each trace is an average of 10\nmeasurements. As one can see the time of flight signal corresponding to the guiding\nmode of our decelerator (trace b Fig. 4) has a smaller area compared to the peak at 352\nm/s final velocity (trace c Fig. 4). This is the direct consequence of asymmetry in our\nquadrupole trap. With no deceleration the lower \"back\" barrier height is 0.3 T (black\ncurve Fig. 2 A). At deceleration of 28,000 m/s2 the fictitious force tilts the effective\npotential, increasing the height of the \"back\" barrier to 0.4 T thus increasing the volume\nof our trap in the phase space. For deceleration values higher than 50,000 m/s2the \"front\"\nbarrier height becomes lower than the \"back\" barrier height and the trap volume in the\nphase space starts to decrease. In our simple model the effective potential depends on\ndeceleration only and as such we do not expect significant loss for the final velocities\nbelow 100 m/s. The 20% reduction in signal between the 100 m/s to 50 m/s velocity\nbeams partly originates from losses that occur during the free flight to the detector that is\nlocated 1.4 cm away from the center of the last trap. Without the magnetic confinement\nthe decelerated cloud of cold atoms expands radially to the Inconel tube walls, leading to\nthe aforementioned loss. The free expansion loss can naturally be avoided by reducing\nthe distance to the detector, applying a focusing coil after the last deceleration stage or by\nreplacing the last deceleration trap with a permanent magnetic trap. From the signal area\n7\n\n\fratios we deduce that about 30% of atoms in a single quantum state (mJ=2) that we are\nable to decelerate to 350 m/s \"survive\" deceleration to 100 m/s as well.\nIt is convenient to characterize the performance of our decelerator using the\nacceptance parameter, the volume in the 6D phase space occupied by particles that can be\nslowed down to some final velocity. In order to establish the decelerator acceptance we\nhave performed numerical Monte-Carlo simulations (no free parameters) with magnetic\nfields calculated using the finite element method. We calculated the longitudinal and\ntransverse phase space distributions for two final velocities, 350 m/s (Fig. 2 C and D) and\n50 m/s (Fig. 2 E and F). We start our calculations with particles uniformly distributed\nwithin a 6D block (dimensions of 60\u00d760\u00d760 m/s and 20\u00d720\u00d720 mm) in the phase space\nat the entrance of our decelerator. The solid lines in Fig. 2 C and E represent separatrices\ncalculated using the one dimensional time averaged longitudinal potential including the\ntilt due to the fictitious force. The transverse phase space distributions are shown in Figs.\n2 D and F along with separatrices constructed using the one dimensional time averaged\ntransverse potential (Fig. 2 B). As one can see, the simple one dimensional model\ncaptures the main features of our decelerator performance. The calculated acceptance of\nour decelerator for slowing from 430 m/s to 350 m/s is 8*106 mm3(m/s)3 (close to the\noptimal acceptance). At a deceleration of 83,000 m/s2 and a final velocity of 50 m/s the\ndecelerator acceptance becomes 4*106 mm3(m/s)3. In order to operate our decelerator at\nlow (50 m/s) velocities near its optimal acceptance we need to increase the length to 2.1\nmeters. Importantly, the optimal acceptance of our decelerator is very close to the\nemittance of our source, estimated to be about 6\u0001106 mm3 (m/s)3 (at a distance of 15 cm\nfrom the valve, assuming longitudinal velocity spread of \u00b111 m/s and 5mm diameter\nskimmer 10 cm from the valve). Mode matching between the source and the moving\nmagnetic trap can be achieved with such a configuration.\nIn this paper we have demonstrated a new method that is able to efficiently\ndecelerate and stop supersonic beams of paramagnetic atoms and molecules with high\nacceptance. As a first step we have shown deceleration of metastable neon atoms from\n429.7 m/s to 53.8 m/s in a 1.1 meter long device. We have removed 98 % of the kinetic\nenergy.\nOur method combines several important features. (i) Generality: it can be applied\nto decelerate both atoms and molecules that are not amenable to laser cooling, thus being\nvery attractive to study simple reactions that are the basis of quantum chemistry. (ii)\nEfficiency: we avoid problems with transverse confinement by decelerating in a comoving magnetic trap. Mode matching between the source and decelerator trap can be\nachieved at a price of increased decelerator length. (iii) Experimental apparatus\nsimplicity: all of the decelerator components are placed outside of the vacuum chamber.\nWe expect that the combination of these features will place many interesting experiments\nwithin reach.\nWe acknowledge Uzi Even for many helpful discussions and sound advice.
