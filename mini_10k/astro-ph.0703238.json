Introduction\nGamma ray bursts (GRBs) are possibly the most luminous\nobjects in the Universe. Extremely high energy released in\nvery short timescales suggests that GRBs involve the formation of a black hole (BH) via a catastrophic stellar collapse event or possibly a neutron star merger, implying that\nan inner engine could be built on an accreting BH (Piran\n2004).\nAmong a variety of mechanisms for powering GRBs,\nthe BZ process (Blandford & Znajek 1977) has the unique\nadvantage of providing \"clean\" (free of baryonic contamination) energy by extracting rotating energy from a BH\nand transferring it in the form of Poynting flow in the outgoing energy flux (Lee et al. 2000). Recently, observations\nand theoretical considerations have linked long-duration\nGRBs with ultrabright Type Ib/c SNe (Galama et al. 1998;\nBloom et al. 1999). Brown et al. (2000) proposed a specific\nscenario for a GRB-SN connection. They argued that the\nGRB is powered by the BZ process and the SN is powered by the MC process, which is regarded as one of the\nvariants of the BZ process (van Putten 1999; Blandford\n1999; Li 2000, 2002; Wang et al. 2002). However, they\nfailed to distinguish the fractions of the energy for these\ntwo objects. More recently, van Putten and collaborators\nproposed a dominant spin-connection between the central\nBH and surrounding high-density matter (van Putten 2001;\nvan Putten & Levinson 2003). It is based on similar shapes\nin topology of the torus magnetosphere with the magnetosphere of pulsars, when viewed in a poloidal cross-section.\nThis description points towards complete calorimetry on\nGRB-SNe, upon including an unexpectedly powerful longduration burst of gravitational-radiation, representing most\nof the spin-energy liberated from the central BH.\nLei et al. (2005, hereafter LWM05) proposed a scenario\nfor GRBs in Type Ib/c SNe, invoking the coexistence of\nSend offprint requests to: D. X. Wang\ne-mail: dxwang@mail.hust.edu.cn\n\nthe BZ and MC processes. In LWM05 the half-opening angle of the magnetic flux tube on the horizon is determined\nby the mapping relation between the angular coordinate\non the BH horizon and the radial coordinate on the surrounding accretion disk. In this scenario the half-opening\nangle evolves to zero with the spinning-down BH. This effect shuts off a GRB, and the overall timescale of the GRB\ncould be fitted by the lifetime of the open magnetic flux on\nthe horizon.\nBesides the feature of high energy released in very short\ndurations, most GRBs are characterized by highly variable light curves with complex temporal behavior. The\nusual explanations of the temporal structures range from\nmultiple shock fronts running into the ambient medium\n(Sari, Narayan & Piran 1996), expanding shells with\nbrighter patches and dimmer regions (Fenimore, Madras &\nNayakshin 1996), to repeated series of pulses with Gaussian\nor power-law profiles (Norries et al. 1996). However, a\nclear physical explanation is lacking. Some authors (Fargion\n& Salis 1996; Blackman, Yi & Field 1996; Fargion 1999;\nPortegies Zwart, Lee & Lee 1999, hereafter PZLL99;\nPortegies Zwart & Totani 2001, hereafter PZT01; Fargion\n& Grossi 2006) suggested that the light curves of GRBs\ncan be explained by a beamed emission from a precessing\njet. PZLL99 constructed ad hoc a function I(t) to describe\nthe outline of the light curves, which is characterized by\nthree timescales: a fast rise with timescale \u03c4rise , a plateau\nphase with timescale \u03c4plat , and a stiff decay with timescale\n\u03c4decay . The complex temporal structures are modulated by\nthe precession and nutation of the jet. Although their model\nsuccessfully fits several light curves of GRBs, the origin of\nthe function I(t) is lacking.\nIn fact, the evolution of the half-opening angle on the\nBH horizon described in LWM05 provides a natural explanation for the outline of the light curves. Based on LWM05\nand PZLL99, in this paper, we intend to combine the evolution of the half-opening angle with the precession and\nnutation of the jet to fit the complex light curves of GRBs.\n\n\f2\n\nLei et al.: A model of the light curves of GRBs\nAsymptotic Collimated Jet\n\n1\n\n\u0398H\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n\u0398H\n\n5.493\n\n5\n\n4.5\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n0\nBlack Hole\n\nDisk\n\nFig. 1. The polodial topology of the magnetosphere of a\ndisk surrounding a rapidly rotating BH (not to scale). Along\nthe open magnetic flux tube, an asymptotic collimated jet\nmay be formed.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we derive the jet luminosity per steradian by the mapping relation between angular coordinate on the BH horizon and the\ncylindrical radius of the collimated jet. Based on the evolution of an extreme Kerr BH we obtain an intrinsic time\nvariation of the gamma-ray emission. It is shown that the\ntime profile of the emission exhibits a fast rise and a slow\ndecay. In section 3, the light curves of several GRBs are\nfitted by combining the evolution of the half-opening angle\nwith the precession and nutation of the jet. In section 4, we\nsummarize the main results and discuss some issues related\nto our model. Throughout this paper the geometry units\nG = c =1 are used.\n\n2. Time profile of jet luminosity\nThe poloidal configuration of the magnetic field is shown\nin Fig. 1, which is adapted from van Putten (2001).\nIn Fig. 1 the angle \u03b8H is the half-opening angle of the\nopen magnetic flux tube, indicating the angular boundary\nbetween open and closed field lines on the horizon. The\nangle \u03b8H can be determined by (Wang et al., 2003)\nZ \u221e\nG (a\u2217 ; \u03be, n) d\u03be.\n(1)\ncos \u03b8H =\n1\n\nEq. (1) is derived based on the conservation of magnetic\nflux with three assumptions: (i) the magnetic field on the\nhorizon BH is constant, (ii) the magnetic field on the disk\nsurface BD varies as a power law with the radial coordinate\nof the disk, and (iii) the magnetic flux connecting the BH\nwith its surrounding disk takes precedence over that connecting the BH to the remote load. In Eq. (1) a\u2217 \u2261 J/M 2\nis the BH spin defined in terms of the BH mass M and the\nangular momentum J, the parameter n is the power-law in\u221d \u2212n\ndex for the variation of BD , i.e., BD\n\u03be , and \u03be \u2261 r/rms is\nthe radial coordinate on the disk, which is defined in terms\nof the radius rms \u2261 M \u03c72ms of the marginally stable orbit\n(Novikov & Thorne 1973). The function G(a\u2217 ; \u03be, n) is given\nby\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\na*\n\nFig. 2.

(1) we have the curves of \u03b8H versus a\u2217\nwith different values of the power-law index n as shown in\nFig. 2, in which the half-opening angle \u03b8H always increases\nmonotonically with increasing n for a given BH spin a\u2217 .\nA very interesting feature shown in Fig. 2 is that the angle \u03b8H evolves non-monotonically with decreasing a\u2217 , i.e., it\nincreases very rapidly as a\u2217 spins down from unity and then\ndecreases slowly to zero for 3.003 \u2264 n \u2264 5.493. Therefore,\nthe time-scale of the duration of the burst is given by the\nlifetime of rapid spin of the BH as mentioned by van Putten\n(2001). This evolution characteristic can be applied to fitting GRBs in two aspects: (1) determining the duration\nof the GRBs as described in LWM05, and (2) shaping the\ntime profile of jet luminosity. To see the latter effect, we\nwill derive the jet luminosity in \u00a72.1, and investigate its\ntime profile in \u00a72.2.\n2.1. Jet luminosity\nAs is well known, the rotating energy is extracted from\na BH in the form of Poynting flow in the BZ process,\nand this energy dissipates and accelerates electrons to produce gamma-rays through synchrotron radiation or inverse\nCompton scattering. Although some works approach the\nmagnetic dissipation in jets, its origin remains unclear\n(Lyutikov & Blandford 2003; Spruit, Daigne, & Drenkhahn\n2001). As a simple analysis, we introduce a parameter \u03b5\u03b3 to\ndenote the fraction of BZ energy converted into gamma-ray\nenergy.\nThe BZ power transferred through two adjacent magnetic surfaces between \u03b8 and \u03b8 + d\u03b8 on the BH horizon is\ngiven by (Wang et al. 2002)\ndP\u0303BZ = dPBZ /P0 = 2a2\u2217\n\nk(1 \u2212 k) sin3 \u03b8\nd\u03b8,\n2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q) sin2 \u03b8\n\n(3)\n\n\fLei et al.: A model of the light curves of GRBs\n\n2\n(4)\n\u03c0 (\u031f\u03c1)r=rH d\u03b8 = BL2 \u03c0RdR.\n\u2206\u03a8H = BH\nP\nSubstituting (\u031f\u03c1)r=rH =\nr=rH sin \u03b8 = 2M rH sin \u03b8 into\nEq.

The opening angle \u03c8jet\nis fixed by sin \u03c8jet \u2248 xL /xf as PZLL99, and a small opening angle \u03c8jet = 6\u25e6 with xf = 10xL is assumed.\nBased on the above equations we express the jet luminosity per steradian for an observer at angle \u03c8 with respect\nto the central locus of the jet, i.e.,\nL\u0303jet (a\u2217 , \u03b8H , \u03c8) \u2261 Ljet /P0 = \u03b5\u03b3 dP\u0303BZ /d\u03a9\n=\n\n\u03b5\u03b3 dP\u0303BZ\n2\u03c0 sin \u03c8d\u03c8\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\u03b3\ndP\u0303BZ d\u03b8 dx\n,\n2\u03c0 sin \u03c8 d\u03b8 dx d\u03c8\n\n(8)\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\nDefining RL \u2261 c/\u03a9F = 2/\u03a9H as the light cylindrical\nradius of the collimated jet, we have xL \u2261 RL /rH = 4/a\u2217 .\nFollowing F97, the radius Rjet of a cylindrically collimated\njet should be less than 4RL . In this work, we assume Rjet \u2248\nRL , and the field lines from \u03b8H near the BH will connect\nto RL in the collimated region as shown in Fig. 1. Thus the\nrelation between \u03b8H and xL is expressed by\n\n4\n6\n\u03a8@degD\n\nHbL\n\nIntegrating Eq.

For the optimal BZ power, k = 0.5 is taken.\nThere are a variety of approaches to studying collimating jet flows, such as the curvature force exerted by the\ntoroidal field (Sakurai 1985), the pressure of the poloidal\nmagnetic field surrounding the jet (Blandford 1993; Spruit\n1994), and the pressure of the baryon-rich wind supported\nby the surrounding disk (van Putten 2001; van Putten &\nLevinson 2003). The collimation of the flow is determined\nby the cross-field force-balance in the direction perpendicular to the field. Fendt (1997, hereafter F97) obtained the\nnumerical solution of the stream equation for this forcebalance of a force-free magnetic jet. The asymptotic jet\ncan be collimated into a cylindrical shape with a jet radius\nof several light cylinder radii.\nIn order to work out an analytical model we adopt\nF97's scenario and assume that the poloidal component\nof the magnetic field of the collimated jet, BL , varies as\nBL /BH = e\u2212\u03bbx , where x \u2261 R/rH is the cylindrical radius\nof the collimated jet in terms of the radius of the BH horizon. Based on the conservation of magnetic flux, we have\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n\u03a8@degD\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 3. \u03c8-dependence of L\u0303jet a) for a\u2217 = 0.99 with n =5,\n4.5, 4 and 3.5 in solid, dash-dotted, dashed and dotted lines,\nrespectively, and b) for n = 5 with a\u2217 = 0.9999, 0.9, 0.8 and\n0.7 in solid, dash-dotted, dashed and dotted lines, respectively.\nwhere \u03b8H = \u03b8H (a\u2217 , n) is determined by Eq. (1).\nTaking \u03b5\u03b3 \u2243 0.15 in calculations as given by van Putten\net al. (2004), we have L\u0303jet varying with \u03c8 as shown in Fig.\n3. From Fig. 3 we find that the value of L\u0303jet is sensitive to n\nand a\u2217 . It vanishes at \u03c8 = 0, and attains its peak value near\nthe spin axis of the BH. In addition, we find that both the\nvalue and the angular coordinate of the peak L\u0303jet strongly\ndepend on the values of a\u2217 and n, while the variation of\nL\u0303jet with \u03c8 remains similar.\nThe \u03b8H dependence of L\u0303jet for the given values of a\u2217\nand \u03c8 is depicted in Fig. 4, and we find that the value of\nL\u0303jet is sensitive to that of \u03b8H .\nCombining the evolution of \u03b8H with the BH spin, we\nhave the curves of the luminosity L\u0303jet versus a\u2217 as shown\nin Fig. 5.\nInspecting Fig. 5, we find that the luminosity L\u0303jet\nevolves non-monotonically with the spin of an extreme\nKerr BH, increasing very fast at first and then decreasing slowly. This result is understandable by considering the\n\n\f4\n\nLei et al.: A model of the light curves of GRBs\n\nnon-monotonic evolution of \u03b8H with a\u2217 and the monotonic\nevolution of Ljet with \u03b8H as shown in Figs. 2 and 4, respectively.\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n2.2.

This state is discussed as the\nsuspend accretion state by van Putten & Ostriker (2001),\nand as the nonaccretion solution by Li (2002). In this state,\nthe BH evolution is governed by the BZ and MC processes.\nBased on the conservation of energy and angular momentum we have the evolution equations of the BH as follows,\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n\u0398H HdegL\n\n80\n\ndM /dt = \u2212(PBZ + PMC ),\n\nFig. 4.

The magnetic field on the BH\nhorizon BH = 1015 G, the initial BH mass M (0) = 7M\u2299 and\nthe initial BH spin a\u2217 (0) = 1 are assumed in calculations.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the time profiles of Ljet exhibit a feature of fast-rise and slow-decay, which arises from the nonmonotonic evolution characteristic of \u03b8H in terms of the BH\nspin as shown in Fig. 2. Thus the intrinsic time profile of the\njet luminosity is derived naturally in our model rather than\nassumed ad hoc, and it resembles that given in PZLL99.\nThe shapes of the profiles can be adjusted by changing the\nvalues of n and \u03c8.

Fitting observed light curves\n\nFig. 7. A schematic picture of a precessing disk with jet\n(adapted from RRS06).\n\n3.1. Precessing jet\nThe misalignment in the spin axis of the BH and the angular momentum axis of the binary causes the accretion disk\naround the BH to precess, which is known as the slaved\ndisk precession. PZLL99 investigated the precession of the\naccretion disk in the gamma-ray binary, in which a neutron star fills its Roche lobe and transfers its mass to a\nBH. It is shown that this system has a precession period\nof about a second. The Lense-Thirring precession appears\nfor a Kerr BH, if the accretion disk is inclined with respect\nto the equatorial plane of the BH (Lense & Thirring 1918).\nRecently, Reynoso et al. (2006, hereafter RRS06) studied\nthe possible effect of Lense-Thirring precession on neutrinocooled accretion disks. It is found that the precession period\ncan be much less than 1 second.\nAs the magnetic field is assumed to be anchored in the\ndisk, this would result in the jet perpendicular to the mid-\n\n3.2. Fittings\nSubstituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (8), we obtain the gammaray luminosity of a prcessing jet Ljet (t), which is adopted to\nfit the observed complex light curves of GRBs. The model\ncontains six free parameters to fit the light curves (as described in Table 1), and the fitting procedures are described\nas follows.\nThe first step is to determine the background. Following\nPZLL99, this is done by averaging the count rate of the\ninitial, \u223c1800 data. The background is subtracted in our\nfitting process.\nNext, we introduce the start time \u03c4start and the end\ntime \u03c4end , which are the times of the start-up and shut-off\nof the real burst, respectively. As a rough estimate, we take\n\u03c4start and \u03c4end as the first and last time to reach about 1%\n\n\f6\n\nLei et al.: A model of the light curves of GRBs\n\nTable 1.

Our model fits the light curve from\n\u03c4start to \u03c4end .\nFrom Figs. 2 and 6 (a), we find that the duration of\nGRB is sensitive to the value of n. Therefore, the first\nfree parameter n is chosen to satisfy the observed duration (\u03c4end \u2212 \u03c4start ) in our model. Substituting n into Eqs.\n(10) and (11), we obtain the evolution functions of BH mass\nM (t), BH spin a\u2217 (t) and half-opening angle \u03b8H (t). The precessing effect is described by the function \u03c8(t). Substituting\nthese functions into Eq. (8), we can produce the time variability of the observed flux.\nFinally, we use the simulated annealing to fit the observed bursts. The other five parameters in Table 1, i.e.,\u03c4pre ,\n0\nR\u03a9 , \u03b8jet\n, \u03b8obs and \u03c6obs are chosen freely in this simulation.\nAfter each iteration we determine the \u03c72 from the fitting\nof Ljet (t) to the observed burst profile. This value is minimized by the annealing algorithm.\nWe apply this model to fit several observed GRBs by adjusting the value of the above six free parameters (see Table\n1). The data of the light curves are taken from BATSE and\nHETE. We fit the light curves of GRBs from the third energy channel, i.e., 100-300keV for BATSE, and 30-400keV\nfor HETE. The fittings results are presented in Fig. 8 with\nthe parameters listed in Table 2.\nInspecting Fig. 8, we find that the light curves of these\nGRBs can be fitted by our model. Some simple light curves\nof GRBs are fitted in a rather satisfactory way as shown\nin Figs. 8a, 8c, 8e and 8g, and complicated light curves are\nfitted with good overall shapes as shown in Figs. 8b and\n8d. Fig. 8f shows the fitting for the more complicated burst\nGRB 030519a for which most of the peaks are well fitted\nexcept for the third one. GRB 920701 is a peculiar asymmetric burst (Romero et al. 1999; RRS06), with a slower\nrise and a faster decay compared with the other bursts. It\nturns out that this type of burst can be also fitted by our\nmodel as shown in Fig. 8b.\n\n4. Discussion\nIn this paper we discuss a model for fitting the light curves\nof GRBs based on the coexistence of the BZ and MC processes, combining the evolution of an extreme Kerr BH surrounded by a precessing disk. Comparing with PZLL99 ,\nPZT01 and RRS06, our model can explain both the intrinsic time profile and the observed duration of GRB. The\nfittings are done with only six parameters. However, there\nare still several issues related to this model and the fittings.\nFirst, a precessing jet tends to produce light curves\nin which subsequent peaks appear at periodic intervals.\nHowever, the observed gamma-ray bursts show no evidence\nfor periodicities at any time-scale. PZT01 solved this problem by considering the interaction between the jet and the\ninterstellar medium. In our model, the distance from the\n\nBH to the emission region is fixed. If this distance varies\nduring the GRB, the asymmetry of the subsequent peaks\nin the light curves could be explained by our model.\nSecond, the individual peaks produced by precession\nclearly lack the observed strong asymmetries, i.e., a fast rise\nand a slow decay (Fenimore, Madras & Nayakshin 1996).\nIn our model, the time variability of the central engine is\nrather smooth. Thus our model cannot explain the strong\nasymmetries. As described in PZT01, the effect of the curvature of the jet front or the cooling of gamma-ray emitting\nelectrons can make the pulse profile a 'fast rise and slow decay'. We will take these effects into account in future work.\nThird, this model is good in fitting the overall shapes\nof the light curves of the bursts, but it is difficult to fit\nthe smaller details such as the variability on time scales\nof milliseconds. Recently, Wang et al. (2006) discussed the\nmodulations of the screw instability in the BZ process on\nthe light curves of GRBs, and they argued that the variability timescales of ten milliseconds can be interpreted by two\nsuccessive flares due to the screw instability of the magnetic\nfield. It is also shown that the individual peaks produced\nby releasing and recovering magnetic energy have a fast rise\nand slow decay profile. We shall improve the fitting of the\nlight curves of GRBs by combining the jet precession with\nscrew instability of the magnetic field in future work.\nWe cannot perform satisfactory fits for all kinds of GRB\nlight curves with this simple model, especially for those displaying extraordinary periods of quiescence between bursts.\nFig. 8f is one of these cases, where a time-lag in the third\npeak is not reproduced. This type of burst is hard to fit\nby the jet-time-profile as given in Fig. 6, i.e., the feature of\nfast-rise and slow-decay. The combinations of parameters\nlisted in Table 2 are not unique in the fittings. For example, the light curve of GRB 920701 can be fitted as well as\nFig. 8b with the parameters (n=3.10; \u03c4pre =5.18, R\u03a9 =8.36;\n0\n=1.02, \u03b8obs =1.19, \u03c6obs =242.58).\n\u03b8jet\nAcknowledgements.
