(1994) during the Parkes Southern Pulsar Survey. With\na period P = 0.808 s and a period derivative \u1e56 = 7.44 \u00d7 10\u221217 s s\u22121 (D'Amico et al. 1998), the pulsar\nhas a characteristic age P/2\u1e56 = 170 Myr, rotation energy loss rate \u0116 = 5.6 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 , and magnetic\nfield B = 2.5 \u00d7 1011 G. From the Taylor & Cordes model (1993), the low dispersion measure (2.38 \u00b1 0.01\ncm\u22123 pc) puts PSR J0108\u22121431 at a distance of 60-130 pc. Although very close, PSR J0108-1431 has\nnever been detected so far outside the radio band. Virtually undetectable according to standard cooling\nmodels, which predict a temperature T < 104 K for an age of \u223c 170 Myr (Tsuruta 1998), the detection\nof optical-UV thermal radiation from the neutron star (NS) surface would allow one to constrain possible\nheating mechanisms like the dissipation of energy of differential rotation (e.g. Van Riper et al. 1994) and\nJoule heating caused by dissipation of the magnetic field in the NS crust (Miralles, Urpin & Konenkov 1998).\nThus, if some heating mechanisms indeed operate, one can expect the surface NS temperature of a few times\n104 K, detectable in the optical-UV but undetectable in X-rays. Optical observations of PSR J0108-1431\nwere carried out with the 6-m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory (Russia), but they were not\ndeep enough to detect the pulsar (Kurt et al. 2000). Therefore, we performed a deep observation with the\nAntu unit of the ESO Very Large Telescopes (VLT) between July and August 2000. Images were obtained\nin the Bessel filters U (9000s), B (5400s), and V (7200s) using the FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph 1\n(FORS1) instrument operated at its standard angular resolution of 0.2\" per pixel, with a corresponding\nfield of view of 6.8\u2032 \u00d7 6.8\u2032 . See Mignani, Manchester and Pavlov (2003) for details on the observations\nand the data reduction. To obtain an updated reference radio position of the pulsar, we performed new\nobservations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2001 March 31 in two bands centered\non 1384 MHz and 2496 MHz. We derived a mean position (epoch 2001.3) of \u03b1J2000 =01 08 08.317 \u00b1 0.010s,\n\u03b4J2000 =\u221214 31 49.35 \u00b1 0.35\", coincident within the uncertainties with that obtained from the timing data\n(D'Amico et al. 1998). This implies an upper limit on the pulsar proper motion of 82 mas yr\u22121 , corresponding\nto a total velocity v < 50d130 km s\u22121 (with d130 being the pulsar distance in units of 130 pc) i.e. within\nthe bottom 10% of the measured pulsar velocity distribution (Lorimer, Bailes and Harrison 1997). By using\nas a reference the positions of stars selected from the GSC II, the most recent pulsar position was finally\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1.

The cross marks the nominal radio position of the pulsar, with the arms equal to 3 times the overall\nuncertainty on the pulsar position. Point-like objects detected at \u2265 3\u03c3 in at least one passband and located\nwithin (close to) a \u223c 6\u2032\u2032 radius around the pulsar position are labelled. (right) Upper limits on the pulsar fluxes\nin the U BV bands and blackbody spectra corresponding to the most stringent B-band limit for the distances of\n60 and 130 pc and a neutron star radius R\u221e = 13 km.\nregistered on the FORS1 images (overall accuracy 0.33\u2032\u2032 in R.A. and 0.46\u2032\u2032 in Dec). The pulsar position\nat the epoch of our optical observations is marked in Fig.1 (left). To facilitate the object detection, all\nthe images have been smoothed using a gaussian filter. The pulsar position falls about \u2248 0.6\u2032\u2032 East from\nan elliptical galaxy in the field. Since such a distance corresponds to about twice the uncertainty of the\npulsar position in R.A, it is unlikely that the pulsar is hidden behind the galaxy, but we cannot rule it out.\nOnly few point-like objects (labelled in Fig.1, left) have been detected within a radius of 6\u2032\u2032 from the pulsar\nposition but they are too distant from the nominal pulsar position to be considered candidate counterparts.\nTherefore, we conclude that no optical counterpart to the pulsar can be identified in our data down to 3\u03c3\nupper limits of V \u2243 28, B \u2243 28.6 and U \u2243 26.4 e.g. more than 3 magnitudes deeper than those obtained by\nKurt et al. (2000). For a distance of 130 pc, estimated from the pulsar's dispersion measure, our constraints\non the optical flux put an upper limit of T = 4.5 \u00d7 104 K for the surface temperature of the neutron star,\nassuming a stellar radius R\u221e = 13 km.\nPSR B1929+10\nPSR1929+10 is also an old (\u223c 3 106 yrs) and relatively nearby (\u223c 330 pc - Brisken et al. 2002) radio\npulsar. Originally detected in X-with Einstein (Helfand 1983), pulsations at the radio period (227 ms) were\ndiscovered by ROSAT (Yancopulous et al. 1994) and confirmed by ASCA (Wang and Halpern 1997). The\nX-ray spectrum could be either thermal (T \u223c 3\u22125 106 K) and produced from hot polar caps (Yancopulous et\nal. 1994; Wang and Halpern 1997) or non-thermal with a spectral index \u03b1 \u2248 1.27\u00b1 0.4 (Becker and Tr\u00fcmper\n1997). A candidate optical counterpart was identified with the HST/FOC by Pavlov et al. (1996) from the\npositional coincidence with the radio coordinates. To secure the identification of the PSR B1929+10 optical\ncounterpart we have applied the strategy used by Mignani et al.(2000), i.e., the measure of a proper motion\nconsistent with the radio one. The field of PSR B1929+10 was imaged with the HST/STIS between August\nand October 2001. Ten 1200s exposures were obtained over five visits with the NUV-MAMA detector\n(24.7\u2032 \u00d7 24.7\u2032 field of view, 0.024\u2032\u2032 pixel size) through the F25QTZ filter (\u03bb = 2364\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb \u223c 842 \u00c5 F W HM ).\nThe STIS time-integrated images were calibrated using the standard HST pipeline and corrected for the CCD\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2.

The two dashed lines represents the optical extrapolation of the best\nfitting X-ray spectral models.\ngeometric distortion. As starting point for our proper motion measurement we used the FOC observations\nof Pavlov et al. (1996), retrieved from the ST-ECF public archive and recalibrated on-the-fly. A complete\ndescription of the relative astrometry procedure with a detailed discussion of the error budget is reported\nin Mignani et al.(2002). After the registration of the different epoch images in a unique reference frame,\nwe could measure the candidate optical counterpart displacement over the 7.2 years (Fig.2, left). The five\nindependent measurements yielded results fully consistent within the errors. By means of a simple \u03c72 fit we\nobtained the best proper motion values: \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) = +97 \u00b1 1 mas yr\u22121 \u03bc\u03b4 = +46 \u00b1 1 mas yr\u22121 corresponding\nto a position angle (PA) of 64.63\u25e6 \u00b1 0.55\u25e6 . Within the errors, these results are fully compatible in both\nmagnitude and direction with the radio ones (Brisken et al. 2002): \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) = +94.82 \u00b1 0.26 mas yr\u22121\n\u03bc\u03b4 = +43.04 \u00b1 0.15 mas yr\u22121 (PA=65.58\u25e6 \u00b1 0.09\u25e6 ). Our proper motion measurement thus provide a robust\nproof that the candidate proposed by Pavlov et al.(1996) is indeed the optical counterpart of PSR B1929+10.\nThe STIS/F25QTZ flux of the pulsar has been compared with the photometry of Pavlov et al. (1996) in\nthe F130LP (\u03bb = 3437.7\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb \u223c 1965 \u00c5 F W HM ) and F342W (\u03bb = 3402\u00c5, \u2206\u03bb \u223c 442 \u00c5 F W HM ) filters.\nAt a variance with middle-aged (\u223c 105 yrs) pulsars such as PSR B0656+14, PSR B1055-52 and Geminga,\nfor which the optical fluxes are somewhat compatible with the extrapolations of their X-ray spectra, the\nflux of the PSR 1929+10 candidate counterpart deviates by about 3 orders of magnitude from the predicted\nvalues (Fig.2, right). In addition, the data seems to be consistent with a power law, with spectral index\n\u03b1 = 0 \u00f7 1, depending on the actual value of the reddening. This result is apparently in contrast with the\navailable data from young to middle-aged pulsars which suggest, as a general trend, a decreasing importance\nof non-thermal processes with the age.\nThe Vela pulsar optical nebula\nA compact (\u223c 4\u2032 ) X-ray nebula around the Vela pulsar was detected in soft X-rays with the Einstein HRI\n(Harnden et al. 1985) and firstly interpreted as a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN) powered by relativistic particles\nejected by the pulsar, which shock in the ambient medium and emit synchrotron radiation. Based on its\n\"kidney-bean\" shape, Markwardt & \u00d6gelman (1998) proposed an interpretation in terms of a bow-shock\nproduced by the supersonic motion of the pulsar through the ambient medium. The Vela pulsar and its\n\n\f4\nPWN have been recently observed with both the High Resolution Camera (HRC) and the Advanced CCD\nImaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on board the Chandra X-ray observatory. Thanks to the excellent angular\nresolution of Chandra, the morphology of the PWN was resolved in a complex structure, similar to that of\nthe Crab PWN, which cannot be explained by a simple bow-shock model. The brighter part of the PWN\n(\u2248 2\u2032 ), shows an approximately axisymmetric structure, with two arcs, a jet, and a counter-jet, embedded\ninto an extended diffuse emission. The axis of symmetry, which can be associated with the pulsar rotational\naxis, nearly coincides with the direction of the pulsar's proper motion (P.A. = 301\u25e6 - e.g., Caraveo et al.\n2001a). The inner PWN is then surrounded by a bean-shaped diffuse nebula (\u223c 2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 ) with an elongated\nregion of fainter diffuse emission southwest of the brighter part of the PWN and detected up to \u223c 4\u2032 from\nthe pulsar. A 100\u2032\u2032 -long outer jet is also seen northwest of the inner PWN. The overall spectrum of the PWN\ncan be described by a power law with an average spectral (energy) index \u03b1 \u2248 0.5, which can be interpreted\nas synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons and/or positrons. Such a spectrum is expected to extend to\noptical and radio frequencies. Although the radio emission from the compact nebula is probably dominated\nby the brightness of the pulsar, highly polarized (up to 60% at 5 GHz) extended (\u223c 4\u2032 ) radio emission has\nbeen indeed detected in the surrounding region (Lewis et al. 2002; R. Dodson 2002, private communication)\nwith two radio lobes southeast (\u223c 18 arcmin2 ) and northeast (\u223c 5 arcmin2 ) wrt the pulsar. One can then\nexpect the presence of an optical nebula around the Vela pulsar, as observed in several other young pulsars\nlike the Crab PWN (see, e.g., Hester et al. 2002, and references therein) and PSR B0540\u201369 (Caraveo et al.\n2001b). Contrary to the Crab and PSR 0540-69, searches for the Vela PWN in optical have been inconclusive\nso far. \u00d6gelman et al. (1989) reported only a marginal detection of a putative optical PWN (\u223c 2\u2032 ).\nTel.\nNTT\n\nHST\n\nVLT\nESO/MPG 2.2m\n\nInstr.\nEMMI-B\nEMMI-B\nEMMI-R\nEMMI-R\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nWFPC2\nFORS1\nFORS1\nWFI\n\nFOV\n6.2\u2032 \u00d7 6.2\u2032\n6.2\u2032 \u00d7 6.2\u2032\n9.2\u2032 \u00d7 8.6\u2032\n9.2\u2032 \u00d7 8.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n2.6\u2032 \u00d7 2.6\u2032\n6.8\u2032 \u00d7 6.8\u2032\n6.8\u2032 \u00d7 6.8\u2032\n34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032\n\nScale\n0.37\"\n0.37\"\n0.27\"\n0.27\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.1\"\n0.2\"\n0.2\"\n0.24\"\n\nDate\nJan 1995\nJan 1995\nJan 1995\nJan 1995\nJun 1997\nJan 1998\nJun 1999\nJan 2000\nJul 2000\nMar 2000\nMar 2000\nApr 1999\nApr 1999\nApr 1999\n\nFilter\nU\nB\nV\nR\n555W\n555W\n555W\n555W\n555W\n675W\n814W\nR\nI\nH\u03b1\n\n\u03bb (\u2206\u03bb)\n3542\u00c5 (542\u00c5)\n4223\u00c5 (941\u00c5)\n5426\u00c5 (1044\u00c5)\n6410\u00c5 (1540\u00c5)\n5500\u00c5 (1200\u00c5)\n6717\u00c5 (1536\u00c5)\n7995\u00c5 (1292\u00c5)\n6750\u00c5 (1500\u00c5)\n7680\u00c5 (1380\u00c5)\n6588\u00c5 (74.3\u00c5)\n\nExp.

The first four columns list the telescope and the\ndetector used for the observations, the field of view and the pixel scale, respectively. The epoch of observation\nis in column five. The filter names are listed in column six, with their pivot wavelengths and widths in column\nseven. The total integration time per observation (in seconds) is given in column eight.\nHere we discuss the results of spatial correlations between the recently obtained Chandra ACIS images\nand HST WFPC2 images, together with observations obtained with the ESO NTT/VLT/2.2m telescopes\n(Mignani et al. 2003). See Table 1 for a detailed summary of the optical observations. For a direct\ncompararison, optical and X-ray images have been superimposed with respect to the absolute (\u03b1,\u03b4) reference\nframe, relying on the astrometric solution of each image. The absolute frame registration between the optical\nand X-ray images turned out to be accurate within \u2248 1\u2032\u2032 \u20132\u2032\u2032 , comparable with the uncertainty in the absolute\nastrometry of each frame. Our starting point was the combined WFPC2 F555W image, which is by far the\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 3. (left) Combined WFPC2/555W image of the Vela pulsar field (11800s). North to the top, East to the\nleft. The pulsar position is located within the innermost contour. (right) Combined U BV R image of the Vela\npulsar field obtained from the NTT/EMMI observations. The overlayed contours (logarithmic scale) correspond\nto the X-ray intensity maps obtained from the Chandra ACIS image of the field integrated over the energy band\n(1\u20138 keV).\ndeepest optical image of the Vela pulsar field. The final image is shown in Fig. 3 (left), where we have\nsuperimposed the X-ray contour map obtained from the combined Chandra ACIS exposure of the region.\nThe point source within the innermost X-ray contour is the optical counterpart of the Vela pulsar. The\ncentral PC field is large enough to map the inner part of the X-ray PWN, i.e., the inner arc, the jet and the\ncounter-jet, easily identifiable in the contour map. Unfortunately, the outer arc region is partially coincident\nwith the CCD gaps between the PC and WFC chips. No optical counterparts of the known X-ray features\ncan be identified in the combined WFPC2/555W image, nor any other structure symmetric to the pulsar\nproper motion direction (Fig.3 - left). We set 3\u03c3 upper limits of 27.4 mag arcsec\u22122 (0.39 \u00d710\u221230 ergs cm\u22122\ns\u22121 Hz\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ) and 27.1 mag arcsec\u22122 (0.57 \u00d710\u221230 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ) for the innermost\nregion (inner arc, jet, and counter-jet) and the outer arc, respectively. After correcting for interstellar\nextinction, these values translate to \u2248 27.0 mag arcsec\u22122 (0.52 \u00d710\u221230 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ) and\n\u2248 26.7 mag arcsec\u22122 (0.57 \u00d710\u221230 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ), respectively. The analysis was repeated\nfor the rest of the optical database, but no evidence for a compact optical nebula was found. We used the\nwider NTT images to search for diffuse optical emission up to distances of \u2248 3 arcmin, in particular at the\nposition of the southwest extension of the X-ray nebula. Although many background enhancements can be\nrecognized in the combined NTT U BV R image (Fig.3 - right), they can be also identified in the ESO/2.2m\nH\u03b1 one, suggesting that they are most likely associated with the bright filaments of the Vela supernova\nremnant. We thus put upper limits on the extended emission of 25.4 mag arcsec\u22122 (2.5 \u00d710\u221230 ergs cm\u22122\ns\u22121 Hz\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ). We have compared the measured optical upper limits on the brightness of the Vela\nPWN for the outer arc and the diffuse emission southwest of the pulsar with the extrapolation of the X-ray\nand radio data. While the optical upper limits for the inner/outer arcs are close to such extrapolation, in\nthe case of the southwest diffuse emission they lie about 3 orders of magnitudes above the expected value\n(Mignani et al. 2003). To summarize, we conclude that it is very likely that just a slightly deeper optical\nobservation would allow one to detect the outer/inner arc (and other bright elements of the inner PWN),\nwhile even deeper optical observations are needed to detect the emission from the Vela PWN at large.\n\n\f6\nREFERENCES\nBecker, W. and Tr\u00fcmper, The X-ray luminosity of rotation-powered neutron stars, A&A 326, 682, 1997\nBrisken, W.F., Benson, J.M., Goss, W.M. and Thorsett, S.E., Very Long Baseline Array Measurement of\nNine Pulsar Parallaxes, ApJ 571, 906, 2002\nCaraveo, P.
