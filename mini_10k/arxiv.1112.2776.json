Recently, ordering associated with dipole-dipole coupling\nbetween monodomain particles randomly placed on a\nsurface was discovered at high temperatures2\u20134 . The\nnanoparticle in such systems in view of its small size acts\nas a single spin.\nZhang and Widom5 applying generalized mean-field\ntheory revealed that the three-dimensional random system of spins within infinitely prolated sample can have\ndipolar ordering. However, the dipolar ferromagnetism in\na moderately elongated spheroid is impossible6 . From geometrical considerations, one can expect in-plane dipolar\nferromagnetism in the two-dimensional systems. Using a\npoint source model which is only valid at the vanishing\nspin concentrations, Meilikhov and Farzetdinova7 showed\nthe absence of the dipolar ordering in the random twodimensional system of Ising dipoles. Nevertheless, it was\ndemonstrated in Ref.7 employing Monte Carlo modeling\na percolative transition to the dipolar ferromagnetism in\nsquare lattice. Scheinfein et al.8 studied by the meanfield theory and Monte Carlo simulations the ordering\nof random Fe islands on the surface and concluded that\ndipole-dipole interactions are insufficient to explain room\ntemperature magnetism observed.\nIn this work, by means of generalized mean-field theory, we show the possibility of in-plane dipolar ordering\nin the two-dimensional sufficiently closely packed system\nof the spins.\nLet us consider the random two-dimensional monolayer\nsystem of identical single-domain particles. In the first\napproximation, we can suppose the nanoparticles as magnetic dipoles which interact with each other spin.

The magnetic moments of the particles may have two opposite directions lying in the plane of the monolayer, N \u03b1 dipoles\nare oriented along a selected direction and N \u03b2 have opposite alignment, \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1, m = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 is an order\nparameter. For Ising model, the distribution over magnetic moments is given by\n\u03c4 (\u03b3) = \u03b1\u03b4(\u03b3) + \u03b2\u03b4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the angle between m and the selected direction.\nThe parameters of the Gaussian distribution are readily obtained:\nc\n11\u03c0cMs2 v 2\n= \u03bc2 .\n4\n16s(2r0 )\ns\n(5)\nThe order parameter can be found from the next equation,\nZ \u221e\ntanh(Ms vH/kB T )W (H) dH,\n(6)\nm=\nH0k = \u2212\n\nMs v\u03c0cm\nh0 cm\n=\n,\n2r0 s\ns\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c3k2 =\n\n\f2\nwhere T is the temperature and kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant.\nThe most interesting critical parameter for such a system is critical concentration above which the ensemble\nhas superferromagnetic ordering.

These values\ndiffer little from c0 obtained using the Gaussian distribution.\nThe phase diagrams showing conditions for the dipolar alignment of in-plane Ising spins are illustrated in\nFig. 1. The curves were calculated by virtue of solving\nEq. (11). For the numerical simulation of cobalt particles, we utilized the dependence of Ms on temperature\nproposed in Ref.10 with Curie temperature Tc = 1385 K.\nThe magnetite nanoparticles was modeled using expression for Ms (T ) based on the Weiss theory:\nMs = 480\n\nr\n\n848 \u2212 T\n.\n548\n\nIt is evident from Fig. 1 that temperature Td of the Ising\nensemble dipolar ordering is mostly constrained by the\nCurie point of the particles.\n\n\f3\nFurther, we consider the two-dimensional ensemble of\nthe single-domain particles with random orientation of\ntheir easy axes. We suppose that the selected direction\n(z-axis) again lies in the plane and the particle magnetic\nmoments may acquire two opposite directions. Now, N \u03b1\nis the number of spins pointing into half-space with positive z and N \u03b2 dipoles point into another half-space,\nm = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2. In this case, the distribution over magnetic\nmoments is\n\u03b1 sin(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b2 cos(\u03b3)\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nTd / Tc\n\n0.8\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the azimuthal angle of m, \u03b3 varies within\nrange [0, \u03c0/2] and the equation for determining magnetization becomes\nZ \u03c0/2\nZ \u221e\nMs vH cos \u03b8\nm=\nsin \u03b8 d\u03b8\ntanh\nW (H) dH\nkB T\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n(13)\nAfter the integration over \u03b8 we arrive at following equation:\n\u0015\nZ \u221e \u0014\nMs vH kB T\nm=\nln cosh\nW (H) dH\n(14)\nkB T\nMs vH\n\u2212\u221e\n\nc\n5\u03c0cMs2 v 2\n.\n=\ns\n12s(2r0 )4\n(16)\nAt zero temperature we come again to formula (8),\nwhich gives now c0 = 5\u03c0/24 \u2248 0.65. This value is appropriate for making use of the Gaussian distribution of\nthe dipolar field. Fig. 2 shows the phase diagrams calculated with Eq. 15. We can see from this figure that the\ncritical temperatures are below than in the case of parallel Ising dipoles. This can be attributable to the chaotic\narrangement of spins and, hence, their fields preventing\nordering.\nFig. 3 depicts the order parameters of magnetite particle system as a function of temperature calculated using\nEqs. (6) and (14). Obviously, the degree of magnetic ordering and the critical temperature of random axis spin\nensemble lie much below than ones of the Ising spin system. The experimentally observed distribution of magnetite nanoparticle magnetic moments was between the\nrandom axis and Ising arrangements4.

Dependence of the order parameter of magnetite\nnanoparticle two-dimensional ensemble on temperature for\nc = 0.8.\n\nScheinfein et al.8 pointed out that exchange is responsible for the order in their experiments. It seems that twodimensional Co nanodot assemblies fabricated by Fang\net al.3 has anisotropy due to growth process. Monte\nCarlo algorithm11 used in Ref.3 also accounts for the\nanisotropy. Thus, these data do not quite correspond\nto the random axis model which has the higher critical\nconcentration for dipolar ordering onset.\nIt worth mentioning that in the case of spins oriented\nperpendicularly to the plane H0\u22a5 > 0 (Ref.9 ) so that\n\n\f4\nonly antiferromagnetic ordering may exist. Obviously,\nthis fact arises from the demagnetizing field of the planar dipole system which has maximum in the transverse\ndirection. It should be also emphasized that the in-plane\norder in the two-dimensional system has local character limited by a certain size12 . The experimental results\nshow splitting into domains4 .\nIn summary, we theoretically demonstrated the possibility of dipolar ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional\nrandom system of spins. We found the critical concentrations of finite dipoles at which this order sets in. It\nfollows from the results of the modeling that the system\nwith in-plane anisotropy has dipolar order at high temperatures.\nThe author is grateful to Dmitri Feldman for useful\ndiscussion.\n1 M.\n\nR.
