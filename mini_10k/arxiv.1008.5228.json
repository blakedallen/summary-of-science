I discuss perspectives of the theoretical description of such reactions using a combination of lattice calculations\nand light-cone sum rules.\nKeywords: electroproduction; nucleon resonances; lattice QCD\n\n1. Introduction\nElectroproduction of nucleon resonances has long been recognized as an\nimportant tool in the exploration of the nucleon structure at different scales.\nThere is a growing consensus that perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization\nbased on hard gluon exchange is not reached at present energies; however,\nthe emergence of quarks and gluons as the adequate degrees of freedom is\nexpected to happen earlier, at Q2 \u223c a few GeV2 . Measurements of the form\nfactors in this transition region are planned at Jefferson Lab1,2 using the\nCLAS12 detector. In this talk such reactions are addressed from the theory\nperspective. I try to formulate the physics goals and explain an approach\nto the electroproduction of resonances that combines lattice calculations\nof wave functions at small transverse separations with dispersion relations\nand quark-hadron duality, known as light-cone sum rules (LCSR).\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts3\u20136 that at large momentum\ntransfer the transition form factors become increasingly dominated by the\ncontribution of the valence Fock state with small transverse separation between the partons. In reality the dominance of valence configurations is\n\n\fDecember 7, 2018\n\n12:47\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nv01\n\n2\n\nlikely to be achieved but \"shrinkage\" to small transverse separations does\nnot seem to occur and also power counting rules based on helicity conservation do not work at moderate Q2 that we are able to study experimentally.\nTo be more specific, the nucleon valence state contains contributions\nwith different orbital angular momentum lz = 0, \u00b11. The leading contribution to form factors at large Q2 comes from the lz = 0 state:6\nZ\n[dx][d2~k] lz =0\nlz =0\n\u03c8\n(xi , ~ki ) \u00d7\n|P \u2191i\n=\n\u221a\n6 x1 x2 x3\nn\no\n\u00d7 u\u2191 (x1 , ~k1 )u\u2193 (x2 , ~k2 )d\u2191 (x3 , ~k3 ) \u2212 u\u2191 (x1 , ~k1 )d\u2193 (x2 , ~k2 )u\u2191 (x3 , ~k3 )\n\nwhere \u03c8 lz =0 (xi , ~ki ) is the three-quark light-cone wave function that depends\non quark momentum fractions xi and transverse momenta ~ki a .\nThe simplification that occurs at asymptotically large Q2 is that the\n~k\u2013dependence of wave functions becomes irrelevant and all necessary (nonperturbative) information is contained in the integral over transverse momenta\nZ \u03bc\n[d2~k] \u03c8 lz =0 (xi , ~ki )\n\u03a63 (xi ; \u03bc) =\nwhere the cutoff \u03bc \u223c Q has to be imposed to make the integral converge.\nThe function \u03a63 (xi ; \u03bc) is called the leading-twist distribution amplitude\n(DA). It can be studied using the operator product expansion7\nn\n\u03a63 (xi ; \u03bc) = 120fN (\u03bc)x1 x2 x3 1 + c10 (\u03bc)(x1 \u2212 2x2 + x3 ) + c11 (\u03bc)(x1 \u2212x3 )\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ c20 (\u03bc) 1 + 7(x2 \u2212 2x1 x3 \u2212 2x22 ) + c21 (\u03bc) (1 \u2212 4x2 ) (x1 \u2212x3 )\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(1)\n+c22 (\u03bc) 3 \u2212 9x2 + 8x22 \u2212 12x1 x3 + . . .\n\nwhere fN (\u03bc) (wave function at the origin) and cik (\u03bc) (shape parameters)\nare scale-dependent coefficients which can be defined as matrix elements of\n(multiplicatively renormalizable) local operators. They can be calculated\nusing QCD sum rules8 or lattice QCD.9 The DA \u03a63 (xi ; \u03bc) is thus a much\nsimpler object compared to the full light-cone wave function \u03c8 lz =0 (xi , ~ki );\nunfortunately this reduction does not seem to work in the Q2 = 5\u221215 GeV2\nrange.\nAnother problem is that the standard pQCD factorization approach\ndoes not take into account contributions of states with non-vanishing orbital\na Here and below we do not show contributions which vanish in the limit of small transverse separations, cf.

Electroproduction of nucleon resonances at high Q2 gives\naccess to three-quark wave functions, more precisely to the overlap integrals between the wave functions of the nucleon and the resonance. These\noverlap integrals are in general too complicated to be calculated in QCD\ndirectly and our strategy will be to reduce these integrals to convolutions\nof distribution amplitudes which can be constrained using lattice QCD.\nWe believe that one important physics goal for such studies will be to\ncompare DAs (alias light-cone wave functions at small transverse separations) of baryon states with opposite parity, e.g. J P = 1/2+ and J P = 1/2\u2212 .\nIt is well known that such \"parity-doublets\" are non-degenerate in QCD\nbecause of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. It is not known, however, whether this difference mainly affects the \"pion cloud\" or it is present\nat short distances already and affects momentum fraction distributions of\nvalence quarks. Moreover, there are indications14 that chiral symmetry is\neffectively restored in the spectra of higher-mass resonances and it would\nbe extremely interesting to compare the corresponding wave functions.\nThe general strategy of combining the constraints on DAs from a lattice\ncalculation with LCSRs to calculate the form factors is suggested in Ref.

Nucleon and N \u2217 (1535) Distribution Amplitudes from\nLattice QCD\nBaryon states of different parity can be identified in a lattice calculation as\nthose propagating forward or backward in (imaginary) time,16,17 so in fact\nthe results for N \u2217 (1535) reported in Ref. [15] are essentially a byproduct\nof our calculation of the nucleon DAs.9 These results were obtained using\nQCDSF/DIK gauge configurations with two flavors of clover fermions for\ntwo different \u03b2 values and several quark masses on 243 \u00d7 48 lattices. The\ncalculation was done using nonperturbatively renormalized three-quark operators18 with up to two derivatives imposing a RI'-MOM\u2013like renormalization condition and converting the results to the M S scheme. In this way\nthe mixing with \"total derivatives\" is automatically taken into account.\nThis work will be continued, using larger lattices and smaller pion\nmasses in order to minimize effects of the chiral extrapolation. In Fig. 1\nI present preliminary results19 of the new calculation using ca. 600 Nf = 2\ngauge configurations on a 323 \u00d7 64 lattice with \u03b2 = 5.29 (a = 0.0753 fm)\nand pion mass m\u03c0 \u2243 282 MeV (m\u03c0 L = 3.44)).

The left-most points at m2\u03c0 \u2243 0.08 GeV2 are new.\nThey are much closer to the physical point and show, for the first time, that\nfor small pion masses fN \u2217 becomes smaller than fN .

Barycentric plots for the nucleon (left) and N \u2217 (1535) (right) distribution amplitudes.\n\nThe results for shape parameters of the nucleon distribution amplitudes (1) are shown on the right panel. One sees that coefficients of firstorder polynomials c10 and c11 can be quantified, whereas contributions\nof second order polynomials are less constrained. The main reason for\nthis are the O(a) discretization errors in the chain rule for derivatives\nD(A * B) = (DA) * B + A * (DB) + O(a) which spoil energy conservation: after the (nonperturbative) renormalization we obtain for the sum of\nthe quark momentum fractions x1 + x2 + x3 \u2243 0.94 instead of unity. This\nis one of the issues that have to be addressed in future studies.\nThe main result so far is that the accuracy of modern lattice calculations\nis sufficient to detect differences in quark momentum fraction distributions\nin the nucleon and its parity partner state. Our calculations support a\nqualitative picture suggested by QCD sum rules8 that the valence quark\nwith the spin parallel to that of the nucleon carries most of its momentum,\nand for N \u2217 (1535) this effect appears to be even stronger. As an illustration\nwe show in Fig. 2 the DAs of the nucleon and N \u2217 (1535) in barycentric\ncoordinates.b Note that the N \u2217 (1535) DA appears to be more narrow and\nshifted towards the lower-right corner.\nAll these results are preliminary and the study will be continued using\nlarger lattices and smaller pion masses. The comparison of the nucleon and\nN \u2217 (1535) will remain our primary goal for some time, but the calculations\nwill also be extended to the full J P = 1/2+ and J P = 1/2\u2212 baryon octets\nand to the decuplets.

In\nparticular the large decay width of N \u2217 (1535) in the N \u03b7 channel has to be\nunderstood and it can only be addressed in lattice calculations with three\nflavors of dynamic fermions. Discretization errors O(a) in the lattice definition of the relevant operators become a serious issue for second moments\nand have to be reduced in order that the results for c2k coefficients become\nfully quantitative.\n3.

The dependence on M 2 is unphysical in the same sense as\nthe factorization scale \u03bc dependence in truncated perturbative expansions,\nbut it is usually weak. The pQCD limit3\u20136 corresponds to the leading part\nof the contribution of leading-twist DAs at large momentum transfer, and\nthe main difference is that higher-twist contributions are not suppressed by\npowers of \u039b2QCD /Q2 , but rather of \u039b2QCD /s0 with s0 \u223c (1.5 GeV)2 . The\nreason for this is that LCSRs take into account \"soft\" contributions to\nthe form factors coming from large transverse separations. The attractive\nfeature of this approach is that such terms are calculated in terms of the\nDAs, thus avoiding the need to know (model) the full nonperturbative k\u22a5\ndependence of wave functions.\nIn leading order, the sum rules for Q2 G1 (Q2 )/(mN mN \u2217 ) and \u22122G2 (Q2 )\nhave the same functional form as the similar sum rules21,22 for the Dirac\nand Pauli electromagnetic form factors of the proton, with the replacement\nmN \u2192 mN \u2217 in the light-cone expansion part, and different DAs.\nThe experimental results for the electroproduction of N \u2217 (1535) are usually presented for helicity amplitudes A1/2 (Q2 ) and S1/2 (Q2 ) which can be\nexpressed in terms of the form factors:23\ni\nh\nA1/2 = e B Q2 G1 (Q2 ) + mN (mN \u2217 \u2212 mN )G2 (Q2 ) ,\ni\nh\ne\nS1/2 = \u221a B C (mN \u2212 mN \u2217 )G1 (Q2 ) + mN G2 (Q2 ) .\n2\nHere e is the elementary charge and B, C are kinematic factors defined as\ns\ns\n(Q2 \u2212 m2N \u2217 + m2N )2\nQ2 + (mN \u2217 + mN )2\n.\n,\nC = 1+\nB=\n5\n2\n2\n2mN (mN \u2217 \u2212 mN )\n4Q2 m2N \u2217\nThe results of the LCSR calculation of the form factors (normalized to\nthe dipole) and helicity amplitudes using lattice-constrained N \u2217 DAs from\nRef.

The Q2 -dependence of the form factors Q2 G1 (Q2 ) and G2 (Q2 )\nis predicted to be similar to the Dirac and Pauli nucleon electromagnetic\nform factors, respectively.

Form factors (left panel) and helicity amplitudes (right panel) for the electroexcitation of the N \u2217 (1535) resonance calculated using the DAs in Ref. [15]. The experimental\ndata are from Refs. [24\u201327].\n\nThese results have to be viewed as exploratory and further work is\nneeded to make them quantitative. First of all, the LCSRs for baryon form\nfactors have to be extended to the next-to-leading (NLO) accuracy, i.e.\nincluding the O(\u03b1s ) corrections. This calculation is rather cumbersome and\nnot straightforward because of contributions of evanescent operators. As the\nfirst step in this direction, the NLO corrections to contributions of leadingtwist DAs in the LCSRs for the electromagnetic nucleon form factors F1\nand F2 have been calculated in Ref. [28], see Fig. 5. One sees that such\ncorrections are significant, especially in the GE /GM ratio. The extension of\nthis calculation to contributions of sub-leading twist-4 DAs and the detailed\nstudy of baryon mass corrections to the sum rules is planned for the coming\nyears.\nSecond, one has to remember that the LCSRs suffer from irreducible\nuncertainties due to the duality assumption for contributions of higher resonances and the continuum which for meson form factors is estimated to\nbe of order 10%. (see e.g. Ref. [29]). The experience with applying this\nmethod to baryons is much less than for mesons, so that this \"systematic\nerror\" cannot be estimated reliably. It is therefore imperative to apply the\nsame technique to a maximally broad class of reactions. At present applications include nucleon electromagnetic and axial form factors,21,22,30 N \u03b3\u2206\ntransitions,33 pseudoscalar- and vector-meson couplings to octet and decuplet baryons,34 weak decays of the type \u039bb \u2192 pl\u03bdl 31 and \u039bb \u2192 \u039bl+ l\u2212 ,32\nand pion electroproduction at threshold.35,36 I expect that this list will\ncontinue to grow, giving us confidence in the whole program.\n\n\fDecember 7, 2018\n\n12:47\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nv01\n\n9\n2\n\n2\n\n1.75\n\n1.75\n\nGM /( \u03bc p G D )\n\nGM /( \u03bc pG D )\n\n1.5\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n\n1\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nQ2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.75\n\n1.75\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nQ2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n1.5\n\n1.25\n\n\u03bc p GE /G M\n\n\u03bc pGE /G M\n\n1.5\n1.25\n\n1\n0.75\n\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nQ2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nQ\n\n2\n\nFig. 5.
