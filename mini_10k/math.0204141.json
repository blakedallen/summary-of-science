[math.QA] 10 Apr 2002\n\nA QUASI-HOPF ALGEBRA FREENESS THEOREM\nPETER SCHAUENBURG\nAbstract. We prove the quasi-Hopf algebra version of the Nichols-Zoeller\ntheorem: A finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra is free over any quasi-Hopf\nsubalgebra.\n\n1. Introduction\nKaplansky's first conjecture [5] asked whether a Hopf algebra H is always free\nover any Hopf subalgebra K. While this is false in the infinite-dimensional case,\nas shown by Oberst and Schneider [11], it is true when H is finite-dimensional.\nThis is the content of the celebrated Nichols-Zoeller theorem [10]. More generally,\nNichols and Zoeller prove that Hopf modules in the category MH\nK are always free\nas K-modules, provided again that H is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra and K a\nHopf subalgebra. The Nichols-Zoeller theorem is an indispensable tool in the study\nof finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.\nIn the present paper, we will prove the essentially the same results for quasiHopf algebras in place of Hopf algebras. Quasi-Hopf algebras were introduced by\nDrinfeld [1]. By definition, a quasibialgebra H is an algebra and a non-coassociative\ncoalgebra, whose lack of coassociativity is controlled by an invertible element \u03c6 \u2208\nH \u2297 H \u2297 H, the associator; more precisely, comultiplication is coassociative up to\nconjugation by \u03c6. The \"meaning\" of the definition is already explained in Drinfeld's\npaper: The axioms are such that the category H M of modules over H is a monoidal\ncategory with respect to the diagonal module structure on the tensor product of\nH-modules, taken over the base field k. The rather complicated axioms for a\nquasiantipode are designed so that one can define a dual H-module for any finitedimensional H-module.\nThe question for a Nichols-Zoeller theorem for quasi-Hopf algebras was brought\nto the author's attention by Robert Fischer. We shall prove that a quasi-Hopf\nalgebra H is a free module over any quasi-Hopf subalgebra K. This is by definition\na subalgebra and (non-coassociative) subcoalgebra such that K \u2297 K \u2297 K contains\nthe associator \u03c6. Interesting examples of quasi-Hopf algebra inclusions in this sense\nhave recently been studied by Masuoka [7, 8]. We note that in Masuoka's examples,\nwhich are generalizations of bicrossproduct constructions, H is a free K-module by\nconstruction. The same is true for the embedding of a finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf\nalgebra in its Drinfeld double, cf. [2, 3].\nWe will also prove a quasi-Hopf version of the freeness result of Nichols and\nZoeller on Hopf modules. However, we will not use this result to prove freeness of\nH over K. In fact the freeness of H over K will be proved in the more general\nsituation that K is a subalgebra of H, which has some structure of quasi-Hopf\nalgebra with its own associator that needs not coincide with that of H. Natural\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 16W30.\nKey words and phrases. Quasi-Hopf algebra, Nichols-Zoeller theorem, Hopf module.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPETER SCHAUENBURG\n\nexamples of such a situation come immediately to mind: If K and F are quasi-Hopf\nalgebras, then K \u2297 F := H is a quasi-Hopf algebra, containing K as a subalgebra\nand subcoalgebra, but with its associator not contained in K \u2297 K \u2297 K, unless the\nassociator of F is trivial. (Incidentally, H is of course a free K-module in this\nsituation.)\nOur proofs will follow the original proofs of Nichols and Zoeller, or more precisely\nthe account in Montgomery's book [9], quite closely. A lemma on modules over\nFrobenius algebras, in particular, will retain its key r\u00f4le in the proof. The main\nobstacle for the generalization is the constant use of Hopf module categories like\nMH\nK , and of structure theorems for Hopf modules. Note that the said Hopf module\ncategory is not defined when H is a quasi-Hopf algebra, since then H need not be\na coalgebra.\nThese difficulties can be overcome by considering suitable Hopf module categories that have been defined by Hausser and Nill [4]. The point is that while\na quasibialgebra is not a coalgebra, one can still define Hopf bimodule categories\nH\nH MH . This is surprising at first sight, but the definition by Hausser and Nill turns\nout to be simply the definition of an H-comodule - but within the monoidal category H MH of H-bimodules, in which H is a coalgebra after all. This categorical\nviewpoint on Hopf modules was stressed and used in [15]. Hausser and Nill also\nproved a structure theorem for Hopf modules in H MH\nH , generalizing the well-known\nstructure theorem for Hopf modules in MH\nwith\nan\nordinary Hopf algebra H.\nH\n2. Preliminaries\nThroughout the paper, we work over some base field k. Tensor products, algebras\nand the like are over k.\n2.1. Quasi-Hopf algebras. We recall the definition and some basic facts concerning quasibialgebras, quasi-Hopf algebras, and their relation to monoidal categories.\nGeneral references are Drinfeld's original paper [1], and Kassel's book [6].\nA quasibialgebra H = (H, \u2206, \u03b5, \u03c6) consists of an algebra H, algebra maps \u2206 : H \u2192\nH \u2297 H and \u03b5 : H \u2192 k, and an invertible element \u03c6 \u2208 H \u22973 , the associator, such that\n(2.1)\n\n(\u03b5 \u2297 H)\u2206(h) = h = (H \u2297 \u03b5)\u2206(h),\n\n(2.2)\n\n(H \u2297 \u2206)\u2206(h) * \u03c6 = \u03c6 * (\u2206 \u2297 H)\u2206(h),\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\n(H \u2297 H \u2297 \u2206)(\u03c6) * (\u2206 \u2297 H \u2297 H)(\u03c6) = (1 \u2297 \u03c6) * (H \u2297 \u2206 \u2297 H)(\u03c6) * (\u03c6 \u2297 1),\n(H \u2297 \u03b5 \u2297 H)(\u03c6) = 1\n\nhold for all h \u2208 H. We will write \u2206(h) =: h(1) \u2297 h(2) , \u03c6 = \u03c6(1) \u2297 \u03c6(2) \u2297 \u03c6(3) , and\n\u03c6\u22121 = \u03c6(\u22121) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22122) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22123) .\nIf H is a quasibialgebra, then the category H M of left H-modules is a monoidal\ncategory in the following way: For V, W \u2208 H M the tensor product V \u2297 W is an\nH-module by h(v \u2297 w) = h(1) v \u2297 h(2) w. The base ring k is an H-module via \u03b5. The\ncanonical morphisms V \u223c\n=V \u2297k \u223c\n= k \u2297 V are H-linear for V \u2208 H M. The map\n\u03a6 : (U \u2297 V ) \u2297 W \u220b u \u2297 v \u2297 w 7\u2192 \u03c6(1) u \u2297 \u03c6(2) v \u2297 \u03c6(3) w \u2208 U \u2297 (V \u2297 W )\nfor H-modules U, V, W is H-linear as a consequence of (2.2), and satisfies Mac\nLane's pentagon axiom for a monoidal category as a consequence of (2.3).\nWe denote H with the opposite multiplication, coopposite comultiplication, or\nboth, by H op , H cop , and H bop , respectively. If (H, \u03c6) is a quasibialgebra, so is\n(H op , \u03c6\u22121 ), (H cop , \u03c6(3) \u2297 \u03c6(2) \u2297 \u03c6(1) ), and hence also (H bop , \u03c6(\u22123) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22122) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22121) ).\n\n\fA QUASI-HOPF ALGEBRA FREENESS THEOREM\n\n3\n\nIf (B, \u03c8) is another quasibialgebra, then H \u2297 B is a quasibialgebra with associator\n\u03c6(1) \u2297 \u03c8 (1) \u2297 \u03c6(2) \u2297 \u03c8 (2) \u2297 \u03c6(3) \u2297 \u03c8 (3) .\nA quasiantipode (S, \u03b1, \u03b2) for a quasibialgebra H consists of an algebra antiautomorphism S of H, and elements \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 H, such that\nS(h(1) )\u03b1h(2) = \u03b5(h)\u03b1,\n(1)\n\n\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b2S(\u03c6\n\n(3)\n\n)\u03b1\u03c6\n\n= 1,\n\nh(1) \u03b2S(h(2) ) = \u03b5(h)\u03b2,\n(\u22121)\n\nS(\u03c6\n\n)\u03b1\u03c6(\u22122) \u03b2\u03c6(\u22123) = 1\n\nhold in H, for h \u2208 H. A quasi-Hopf algebra is a quasibialgebra with a quasiantipode. If H is a quasi-Hopf algebra, then so are H op , H cop , and H bop ; for later\nuse we note that the underlying map of the antipode of H op is S \u22121 . Let H be a\nquasi-Hopf algebra. If V is a finite-dimensional left H-module, then V \u2217 , the dual\nvector space, becomes an left H-module with the action induced by the transpose of\nthe original action of H via the antipode, that is, by setting hh * \u03c6, vi = h\u03c6, S(h)vi,\nfor h \u2208 H, \u03c6 \u2208 V \u2217 , and v \u2208 V , where h, i denotes evaluation. Together with\nsuitable evaluation and coevaluation maps\nev : V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2192 k,\n\ndb : k \u2192 V \u2297 V \u2217\n\nthe object V \u2217 is a dual object to V in the monoidal category of H-modules.\n2.2. Hopf modules. Let H be a quasibialgebra. Then it is impossible to define a\ncomodule over H, since H is not a coassociative coalgebra. It is also impossible to\ndefine a Hopf module category MH\nH with one module and one comodule structure.\nHowever, there is a definition of Hopf modules in H MH\nH , which can be viewed\nas a special case of the theory of (co)algebras and (co)modules within monoidal\ncategories. For a development of this theory, in which many of the elementary facts\nand constructions of ordinary ring theory can be carried over to quite arbitrary abstract monoidal categories replacing the category of abelian groups or k-modules,\nwe refer the reader to [13, 14]. We have applied this point of view on Hopf modules\nover quasi-Hopf algebras in [15]; it allows us to get away without lengthy calculations involving associators and the explicit use of the quasibialgebra axioms in\nmany cases.\nThe axioms of a quasibialgebra imply that H is a coassociative coalgebra within\nthe monoidal category H MH of H-H-bimodules: The associator morphism in\n\u223c\nH MH = H op \u2297H M is given by\n\u03a6 : (U \u2297 V )\u2297 W \u220b u \u2297 v \u2297 w 7\u2192 \u03c6(1) u\u03c6(\u22121) \u2297 \u03c6(2) v\u03c6(\u22122) \u2297 \u03c6(3) w\u03c6(\u22123) \u2208 U \u2297 (V \u2297 W ),\nso that coassociativity of H as a coalgebra in H MH is in fact the same as (2.2).\nNow one can define Hopf modules over H, as first introduced by Hausser and\nNill [4], as follows:\nDefinition 2.1. Let H be a quasibialgebra. A Hopf module M \u2208 H MH\nH is a right\nH-comodule within the monoidal category H MH of H-bimodules. Explicitly, M\nis an H-H-bimodule equipped with a map \u03b4 : M \u2192 M \u2297 H, \u03b4(m) = m(0) \u2297 m(1) ,\nsatisfying m(0) \u03b5(m(1) ) = m and\n(M \u2297 \u2206)\u03b4(m) * \u03c6 = \u03c6 * (\u03b4 \u2297 H)\u03b4(m)\nfor all m \u2208 M , where the multiplication by \u03c6 now takes place in the H \u2297 H \u2297 Hbimodule M \u2297 H \u2297 H.\nMore generally, let K \u2282 H be a quasi-Hopf subalgebra. Then H is also a\ncoalgebra in K MK , and we define the Hopf module category K MH\nK to be the\ncategory of H-comodules within K MK .\n\n\f4\n\nPETER SCHAUENBURG\n\nWe note that Hopf module categories like\nsame way.\n\nH\nH\nH\nK MK , K MK\n\ncan be defined in the\n\nThe interpretation of Hopf modules as comodules within some monoidal category\ngives an immediate supply of constructions of and with such objects. We refer the\nreader to [15] for examples rather than giving explicit details on the following uses\nof the general principle:\nRemark 2.2. Let H be a quasibialgebra and K a quasi-Hopf subalgebra.\n*\nH\n1. Whenever P \u2208 K MK , and M \u2208 K MH\nK , then * P* \u2297 * M* \u2208 K MK . Here\nand below the dots are supposed to indicate that M \u2297 P is endowed with\nthe diagonal left and right K-module structures, and the right H-comodule\nstructure induced by that of P , but taken within the monoidal category K MK\nwith its nontrivial associator isomorphism. Explicitly, this means that the\ncomodule structure is given by\nP \u2297 M \u2192 (P \u2297 M ) \u2297 H,\np \u2297 m 7\u2192 \u03c6(\u22121) p\u03c6(1) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22122) m(0) \u03c6(2) \u2297 \u03c6(\u22123) m(1) \u03c6(3) .\n2. As a special case, for any P \u2208 K MK we have * P* \u2297 * H** \u2208 K MH\nK . This is\nthe cofree right H-comodule generated by P within the monoidal category\nK MK .\n3. Again as a special case, one can consider * V \u2297 * H** \u2208 K MH\nK for any V \u2208 K M.\n4. As in any monoidal category, there is a notion of cotensor product of a right\nand a left H-comodule within K MK , that is, a cotensor product M \u2737H N \u2208\nH\nH\nK MK for M \u2208 K MK and N \u2208 K MK . About this construction, we shall\nonly need to know that\nM \u2737 (* H* \u2297 * P* ) \u223c\n=M \u2297P\nH\n\n*\n\n*\nas K-K-bimodules, for any M \u2208 K MH\nK and P \u2208 K MK . Here, * H* \u2297 * P* \u2208\nH\nK MK is a left-right switched version of the construction in (2).\n\nThe structure theorem for Hopf modules over quasi-Hopf algebras proved by\nHausser and Nill [4, Prop.3.11.] says that, for a quasi-Hopf algebra H, the Hopf\nmodules in H MH\nH constructed in part (3) of Remark 2.2 are the only ones there\nare:\nTheorem 2.3. Let H be a quasi-Hopf algebra. Then the functor\nHM\n\n\u220b V 7\u2192 * V \u2297 * H** \u2208 H MH\nH\n\nis a category equivalence. In particular, every Hopf module in\nH-module.\n\nH\nH MH\n\nis a free right\n\nWe take the liberty to refer to [15] for another proof.\nThe main application of Hopf module theory in [4] is the development of an\nintegral theory for quasi-Hopf algebras. In particular, Hausser and Nill [4, Thm.4.3]\nshow the existence of a cointegral \u03bb \u2208 H \u2217 for any finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf\nalgebra H, which is nondegenerate and hence makes H a Frobenius algebra. Since\nthe fact that H is Frobenius is of key importance for the Nichols-Zoeller result, we\nshall sketch a short proof of this fact for completeness:\nTheorem 2.4. Let H be a finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra. Then there exists\na non-degenerate linear form \u03bb \u2208 H \u2217 , so that H is a Frobenius algebra.\n\n\fA QUASI-HOPF ALGEBRA FREENESS THEOREM\n\n5\n\n(Nondegeneracy means that H \u00d7 H \u220b (g, h) 7\u2192 \u03bb(gh) \u2208 k is a nondegenerate\nbilinear form.)\nProof. Since H is a quasi-Hopf algebra, so is H op , and hence H op \u2297 H. This implies\nthat for each V \u2208 H MH \u223c\n= H op \u2297H M the dual space V \u2217 becomes a dual object for\nV within the monoidal category H MH , with module structures induced by the\nantipode of H op \u2297 H. More precisely, the H-H-bimodule structure on V \u2217 is given\nby\nhg * \u03c6 * h, vi = h\u03c6, S(g)vS \u22121 (h)i\nfor v \u2208 V , \u03c6 \u2208 V \u2217 , and g, h \u2208 H, where h, i denotes evaluation. It is easy to check\n(and a very special case of [13, Cor.3.7.]) that when an object V of a monoidal\ncategory C is a left comodule over some coalgebra C \u2208 C, and has a dual V \u2217 , then\nV \u2217 is a right C-comodule. For example, since H is a left H-comodule within the\nmonoidal category H MH , its dual H \u2217 is a right H-comodule (whose structure map\nwe will not need to know), that is, an object of H MH\nH . It follows from Theorem\n2.3 that there is a (one-dimensional) left H-module V and an isomorphism\n\u03c8 : * V \u2297 * H** \u2192 H \u2217\nof Hopf modules in H MH\nH . Since \u03c8 is a right H-module map, it has the form\n\u03c8(v \u2297 h) = \u03c80 (v)h for some \u03c80 : V \u2192 H \u2217 . Let v \u2208 V \\ {0}, and set \u03bb := \u03c80 (v).\nThen it follows that\nH \u220b h 7\u2192 (\u03bb * h : g 7\u2192 \u03bb(S \u22121 (g)h)) \u2208 H \u2217\nis an isomorphism. Therefore, \u03bb is nondegenerate and H is Frobenius.\n3. Nichols-Zoeller for quasi-Hopf algebras\nIn this section we prove the quasi-Hopf algebra version of the Nichols-Zoeller\ntheorem. The proof follows quite precisely the course taken in the ordinary Hopf\ncase, where we rely on the account given in Montgomery's book [9]. However, one\nhas to take special care whenever a Hopf module argument comes in, due to the\nfact that Hopf modules have a delicate definition. In particular, the relevant Hopf\nmodule categories used in the original proof do not exist in the quasi-Hopf case;\nluckily, the actual objects in consideration can be located in Hopf module categories\nwhich do exist.\nTheorem 3.1. Let K be a finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra, and W a finitely\ngenerated right K-module. Suppose there exists a finitely generated faithful right\nK-module V such that W \u2297 V \u223c\n= W dim V as right K-modules. Then W is free over\nK.\nProof. Since K is Frobenius, we can apply [9, Prop.3.1.2] which tells us that it is\nenough to show that some power of W is free. Also, we can apply [9, Lem.3.1.2] to\nconclude that there is r > 0 such that W r \u223c\n= F \u2295 E with F a free K-module and\nE a K-module that is not faithful, and also there is s > 0 such that V s \u223c\n= F \u2032 \u2295 E\u2032\nrs dim V\nrs \u223c\n\u2032\n\u2032\nr\ns \u223c\n, we can\nwith F free and E not faithful. Since W \u2297 V = (W \u2297 V ) = W\nreplace W by W r and V by V s , and assume that W \u223c\n= F \u2032 \u2295 E\u2032.\n= F \u2295 E and V \u223c\nSo far, everything proceeded as in [9]. Now we consider ** K* \u2297 * V \u2208 K\nK MK by\napplying part (3) of 2.2 to K bop . By the version of Theorem 2.3 for K bop , this is\na free left K-module, hence * K \u2297 * V \u223c\n= K t as left K-modules, where t := dim V .\nSince F is free, it follows that F \u2297 V \u223c\n= F t . Now\nF t \u2295 Et \u223c\n= Wt \u223c\n=W \u2297V \u223c\n= (F \u2297 V ) \u2295 (E \u2297 V ) \u223c\n= F t \u2295 (E \u2297 V ),\n\n\f6\n\nPETER SCHAUENBURG\n\nand the Krull-Schmidt theorem implies\n\u223cE\u2297V \u223c\nEt =\n= E \u2297 (F \u2032 \u2295 E \u2032 ) \u223c\n= (E \u2297 F \u2032 ) \u2295 (E \u2297 E \u2032 ).\nSince E is not faithful, neither is E t , and hence neither is E \u2297 F \u2032 . But E \u2297 F \u2032 is\nfree, which finally implies that E = 0 and hence W is free. To see that E \u2297 F \u2032 is\nfree, it is in turn sufficient to see that E \u2297 K is free, which follows from Theorem\n2.3, since we can consider E* \u2297 * K** \u2208 K MK\nK by part (3) of Remark 2.2.\nWe arrive immediately at the quasi-Hopf version of the Nichols-Zoeller theorem,\nfor the more general situation advertised in the introduction.\nTheorem 3.2. Let H be a finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra, and let K \u2282 H\nbe a subalgebra that admits a quasi-Hopf algebra structure. Then H is a free (say,\nright) K-module.\nProof. Consider the faithful right K-module H. By Theorem 3.1 it suffices to show\nthat H \u2297 H \u223c\n= H dim H as right K-module. But H* \u2297 * H** \u2208 H MH\nH by part (2) of\nRemark 2.2, so that we can apply Theorem 2.3 to conclude that H \u2297 H is indeed\na free right H-module.\nTo prepare for an application to semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras, modelled on [9,\nCor.3.2.3], we will prove a result of Panaite characterizing semisimple quasi-Hopf\nalgebras in terms of integrals; our proof will utilize Hopf modules.\nTheorem 3.3 (Panaite [12]). A finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra H is semisimple if and only if it contains a left integral t \u2208 H with \u03b5(t) 6= 0 (one might then as\nwell assume that \u03b5(t) = 1). Here, an integral is an element satisfying ht = \u03b5(h)t\nfor all h \u2208 H.\nProof. If H is semisimple, the epimorphism \u03b5 : H \u2192 k of left H-modules splits,\nwhich is the same as the existence of an integral t with \u03b5(t) = 1.\nOn the other hand, assume that \u03b5 : H \u2192 k splits as an H-module map. Then\n\u03b5\u2297V\nfor any V \u2208 H M the epimorphism H \u2297 V \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V splits. ** H* \u2297 * V \u2208 H\nH MH is\na Hopf module, hence a free left module by Theorem 2.3, which shows that V is\nprojective.\nCorollary 3.4. Let H be a finite-dimensional semisimple quasi-Hopf algebra. Let\nK \u2282 H be a subalgebra and (non-coassociative) subcoalgebra that has an associator\nmaking it a quasi-Hopf algebra.\nThen K is also semisimple.\nProof. By Theorem 3.3, H contains a left integral t with \u03b5(t) 6= 0. Since H is\na free left K-module, we can copy word-by-word the proof of [9, Lem.2.2.2.2)]\nand conclude that K also contains such an integral. By Theorem 3.3 again K is\nsemisimple.\nWe now turn to the more general version of the original Nichols-Zoeller theorem\nstating that every Hopf module in MH\nK is free as a K-module. We shall show the\nsame for such objects in K MH\nthat\nare finitely generated K-modules. In order\nK\nthat the indicated Hopf modules be defined in the first place, it will be necessary\nto assume that K is a subquasibialgebra of H. The weaker assumption in Theorem\n3.2 would not be sufficient for this purpose.\nTheorem 3.5. Let H be a finite-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra and K \u2282 H a\nquasi-Hopf subalgebra. Then every Hopf module M \u2208 K MH\nK that is finitely generated as a K-module, is free as left K-module.\n\n\fA QUASI-HOPF ALGEBRA FREENESS THEOREM\n\n7\n\nProof. By part (2) of Remark 2.2 we can consider ** H* \u2297 * H* \u2208 H\nH MH , and by\nTheorem 2.3 it follows that ** H* \u2297 * H* \u223c\n= ** H* \u2297 V* for some right H-module V . (In\nfact V = Had , which is of no importance here.)\nNow we consider ** H* \u2297 * H* \u2208 H\nK MK instead, where we still have the same isomorphism, of course. We conclude that, calculating with cotensor product within\nthe monoidal category K MK as indicated in part (4) of Remark 2.2\n*\n*\n\u223c\n* M * \u2297 * H* = * M \u2737 ( H* \u2297 * H * )\n*\n\nH\n\n*\n\n\u223c\n= M \u2737 (** H* \u2297 V* )\nH\n\n\u223c\n= * M* \u2297 V*\nForgetting about the right module structure, we conclude M \u2297 H \u223c\n= M dim V as left\nK-modules, and apply Theorem 3.1 to conclude that M is a free K-module.\nReferences\n[1] Drinfel'd, V.
