OVs, and more in general light\nbeams carrying OAM, are generated after the insertion of\na phase modulating device (PMD) that imprints a certain vorticity on the phase distribution of the original\nbeam. Such beams can be mathematically described by\na superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) modes characterized by the two integer-valued indices l and p. The\nazimuthal index l describes the number of twists of the\nhelical wavefront and the radial index p gives the number\nof radial nodes of the mode. The electromagnetic field\namplitude of a generic L-G mode in a plane orthogonal\nto the direction of propagation is\n\u221a !|l|\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr 2\nr2\n2r\nulp (r, \u03b8) \u221d\nexp\n\u2212\nexp(\u2212i l \u03b8)\nL|l|\np\nw0\nw02\nw02\n(1)\nwhere w0 is the beam radius and Lm\nn (x) is the associated Laguerre polynomial. The presence of a phase factor exp(\u2212i l \u03b8) implies that these cylindrically symmetric\nmodes carry an OAM equal to l h\u0304 per photon, relative\nto their symmetry axis [1, 2]. For the same reason, a\nphase singularity is embedded in the wavefront, all along\nthe propagation axis, with topological charge equal to l.\nThe intensity distribution of an L-G mode with p = 0 is\ngenerally shaped as a ring with a central dark hole, where\nthe intensity is null due to total destructive interference.\nThe radius of maximum intensity of this donut grows as\nthe square root of l and the intensity value decreases as\nl\u22121/2 [3].\nExperimentally, these properties are produced with\nbeams propagating through nonlinear optical systems [4]\nand Kerr nonlinear refractive media [5]. This induced\nto argue that OAM could also be naturally generated by\nsome astrophysical environments, possibly related to turbulent interstellar media with density discontinuities on\nwide scale ranges or to the distorted geometry around\n\nKerr black holes. It was suggested that OAM could\nbe also present in the blackbody radiation of the cosmic microwave background [6]. OVs have been already\napplied in diverse research fields such as laboratory optics, nanotechnologies and biology [7]. Two astronomical applications have been indicated: first, to overcome\nthe instrumental limitations in the resolution of very\nclose stellar sources due the Rayleigh separability criterion in diffraction-limited telescopes [8, 9, 10], second,\nto improve the capability of imaging extrasolar planets\nby peering into the darkness of an OV generated by a\nPMD inserted in the optical path of a Lyot-type coronagraph [9, 11, 12]. Similar results can be obtained by direct imaging and analysis of tiny deviations of the main\nstar's OV introduced by the presence of a close fainter\ncompanion [13, 14]. However, ground-based telescopes\nwill always feel the detrimental effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing), which reduces the resolving power, even\nwith adaptive optics. Therefore, it is important for the\nabove astronomical applications of OVs to know how the\nseeing can affect the expected donut pattern generated by\nstellar sources. In this Letter we present the first images\nof stellar OVs generated by a PMD placed in the optical path of the Asiago 122 cm telescope. In particular,\nwe show how the effects of the atmospheric turbulence\ncan be overcome to produce good quality OVs suitable\nfor OV coronagraphy even under poor seeing conditions\nand in white light. Even if the contrast needed for the\nsearch of exoplanet or for classical coronagraphy can be\nachieved mainly with even ls [15], we decided to use l = 1\nOVs to avoid some experimental complications as higher\norder ones may not remain stable while propagating in\nturbulent media, and may split in first order ones [16].\nNon-monochromatic optical vortices \u2013 Several\ntypes of PMDs have been designed to generate axially\nsymmetric OVs from an incident monochromatic on-axis\nbeam. The most efficient are computer-generated forkholograms [17] and spiral phase plates (SPP) [18]. How-\n\n\f2\never, the use of non-monochromatic beams in astronomical applications of OVs is mandatory to collect enough\nphotons from faint stellar objects. In this case, the\ndonut -shaped structure of monochromatic OVs will be\nchanged [19, 20]. Using SPPs, which are helicoidal transmission optical devices with a given total thickness variation hs , all monochromatic OVs will have the same axis\nof symmetry. However, different wavelengths will present\ndifferent OAM values according to l = \u2206n(\u03bb) hs /\u03bb,\nwhere \u2206n is the difference between the refraction indices\nof the SPP material and the surrounding medium. Thus,\nthe transmitted beam will possess different OAM values producing donut -shaped patterns of different sizes\nand a progressive filling of the central dark region. Recently [21] a scheme has been proposed to overcome this\nproblem, but achromaticity is expected only for a limited\nbandwidth (\u223c 100 nm) in the visible. We have instead\nused a fork-hologram which is a grating with a number\nl of dislocations on its center. Monochromatic on-axis\nbeams produce OVs with OAM indices l = m l, where m\nis the diffraction order of the grating. Differently from\nSPPs, fork-holograms present the advantage of generating OVs with the same l at all wavelengths for on-axis\npolychromatic sources. For off-axis sources l decreases\nas the star moves away from the center of the hologram.\nSpatial coherence of the incident beam is generally assumed to hold only for stellar sources when observed from\nspace, but when ground-based telescopes are used, quite\ndramatic effects are introduced by the atmospheric turbulence and spatial coherence is lost. However, for exposures shorter than the turbulence timescale (\u223c 10 \u2212\n100 ms in the optical/near-infrared) we can obtain a\ngroup of bright speckles that represent the interference\nimage produced by the coherent wavefronts generated by\nthe random distribution of the atmospheric irregularities.\nA single nearly diffraction-limited stellar image can occasionally be produced when most of the stellar light falls\nin a single bright speckle. Fried [22] coined the term lucky\nexposures to describe high quality short exposures occurring in such a fortuitous way. This is the basis of lucky\nimaging [23], one of the speckle imaging techniques used\nin modern astronomy as alternative to adaptive optics.\nHere we use the lucky imaging technique to obtain OVs\nfrom stellar sources useful for OV coronagraphy, with\nthe additional restriction of selecting only those exposures where the star to be fainted is centered with the\nhologram dislocation.\nTelescope Observations \u2013 Here we report the results\nobtained in a campaign of observations carried out from\n2005 to 2007 with the Asiago 122 cm telescope, that followed some preliminary laboratory simulations [13]. We\nfirst observed the multiple system Rasalgethi (\u03b1 Her)\nand the single star Arcturus (\u03b1 Boo). \u03b1 Her is a visual binary composed by two unresolved binary systems\npresently separated by 4\u2032\u2032 .7: \u03b1 Her A, formed by an\nM5 Ib-II semiregular variable (mV = 2.7 \u2212 4.0) and a\n\nFIG. 1: Optical setups, without (upper panel) and with (lower\npanel) spatial filter. T is the telescope; L1, L2, L3 the lenses;\nH the l = 1 fork-hologram; S the spatial filter slit. Stellar\nspeckle patterns are sketched on the left of the optical setups,\nwhile the output images at the 0th and 1st diffraction order,\non the right. All angles and displacements are exaggerated\nfor clarity.\n\nfainter companion separated by 0\u2032\u2032 .19 [24], and \u03b1 Her B,\ncontaining a G0 II-III giant (mV = 5.4) and a fainter\nsecondary separated by 0\u2032\u2032 .0035 [25]. \u03b1 Boo, instead, is\na single star having visual magnitude mV = 0.04 and\nspectral type K1.5 III. We also performed l = 1 OV\ncoronography with the double system HD74010, which\nF0 components are separated by 9\u2032\u2032 .9 and have visual\nmagnitudes mV,A = 7.72 and mV,B = 7.87. The optical\nschemes for the two types of observations to image the\nOVs are sketched in Fig. 1; the OV coronagraph is presented in [12]. Our l = 1 fork-hologram H is blazed\nat the first diffraction order with 20 lines mm\u22121 and\nhas an active area of 2.6 \u00d7 2.6 mm2 . H was placed in\nproximity of the F/16 Cassegrain focus of the telescope.\nThe OVs produced by non-monochromatic light beams\ncrossing the fork-hologram show intensity patterns that\nappear as rings stretched along the dispersion direction\nwith a central dark strip. The spectral dispersion also\ncauses a partial filling of the central dark zone. Thus,\nif we want to use non-monochromatic OVs produced by\nfork-holograms for OV coronagraphy, we must limit the\nspectral range [13] and/or restore the donut shape (see\ne. g. [26]). In our case we used a variable spatial filter,\nS, made by a slit placed on the Fourier plane of the collimating lens L2 to limit the dispersion of the light at\nthe first diffraction order. This adjustable slit works as\na tunable bandpass filter with flat spectral response and\nhas been used only for single on-axis stars. We used a\nfast CCD camera with 660 \u00d7 494 and 7.4 \u00d7 7.4 \u03bcm pixels,\n16 bit dynamical range (4000 to 6700 \u00c5 with a peak at\n5200 \u00c5) to image the OVs' shapes, and, for coronography,\nthe ultrafast EMCCD Andor iXon+ camera.\nWhile observing the multiple system \u03b1 Her we could\nsimultaneously observe the zeroth and the first diffraction order (l = 0 and l = 1, respectively, for on-axis\nstars). We can then verify how the observed OV patterns\nchange with the distance of the beam from the center\nof the hologram. We placed the fork-hologram 30 mm\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Speckle pattern (right) and dispersed OVs (left) obtained by summing the 4 lucky exposures of \u03b1 Herculis. The\nimage is displayed in a squared greyscale. The reference system used for the extraction of the OV profiles is reported.\nThe x axis corresponds to the direction of dispersion.\n\nbefore the telescope focal plane and set the main star\n(\u03b1 Her A) at the center of the optical system. The mean\nseeing was \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 .8. Under such bad seeing conditions the\nlucky imaging technique empirically predicts that the resolution should improve by a factor 2 if we select 1% of\nframes taken with an exposure time of \u223c 80 ms [23]. We\nthen recorded a sequence of 860 frames at a time step of\n70 ms. To select the best exposures we imposed the additional restriction that the intensity of the peaks of the\n\u03b1 Her A OV were equal, that corresponded to the stellar beam intersecting the center of the hologram. Fig. 2\nrepresents the sum of the 10% lucky speckle patterns observed together with their corresponding OVs. Since the\nsignal from \u03b1 Her A is saturated, an angular resolution\nof \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 .5 was derived from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity profile of \u03b1 Her B. Being\nthe central part of the OV profile of \u03b1 Her A saturated,\nthe choice of the lucky exposures has been made by analyzing the intensity profiles taken across the wings of the\ndispersed OVs. In Fig. 3 we analyze in detail the OV\nprofiles averaged over 10 pixels wide strips perpendicular\nto the dispersion, i. e. along the y axis of Fig. 2. We\nfind that the ratio of the two maxima fitted with two\nGaussians is RA\u2032 = 0.995 \u00b1 0.005 for the on-axis star\nand RB \u2032 = 0.83 \u00b1 0.01 for the off-axis star. We also numerically reconstructed the theoretical intensity profiles\nof the chromatically dispersed on-axis and off-axis OVs.\nThese profiles present dips with intensity of 82% and 70%\nrespectively. As expected for l = 1, their central regions\ncan never be totally obscured also under ideal seeing conditions. The profile A\u2032 of \u03b1 Her A shows a central dip\nof 81%. The OV generated by \u03b1 Her B, being off-axis,\npresents an asymmetric shape with a non-integer l value.\nThe single star \u03b1 Boo was set at the center of the\nhologram and the spatial filter S was introduced to produce a nearly-monochromatic circularly symmetric OV.\nWe adopted a slit width of 0.1 mm, corresponding to a\n300 \u00c5 bandpass width in the visible, that ensured enough\nS/N ratio for the 70 ms exposures. Since in this case\nthe slit did not allow the simultaneous observation of\nthe speckle patterns at the zeroth diffraction order, we\n\nFIG. 3: Observed OV profiles of \u03b1 Her A (A\u2032 , left) and\n\u03b1 Her B (B \u2032 , right) obtained from the selected lucky exposures. The corresponding numerical simulations are represented by the dotted lines. The thin lines are drown at any\ndip level.\n\ncould only select a 17% sub-sample of frames that presented OVs circularly symmetric and therefore centered\nwith the optical singularity of the hologram. We assumed\nthat this condition was met when the ratios of the two\nintensity peaks measured along two perpendicular axes\nacross the OV were close to 1 within an error of \u223c 10\u22122 .\nFig. 4 shows the OV obtained by summing the selected\nlucky frames. The central region of the OV is not totally dark because of the loss of the starlight coherence\ndue to the very bad seeing conditions and to the presence of residual chromatism. We however notice that\nthe contrast between the dark center and the bright ring\nimproves down to 52% with respect to the previous unfiltered symmetric OVs.\nWe finally observed the double system HD74010\nthrough a 100 \u00c5 bandpass red filter centered at 6532 \u00c5\nwithout and with a Lyot stop. The exposure times were\n0.01 s. Fig. 5 shows the results of l = 1 OV coronagraphy: the intensity profiles of the two stars without and\nwith the Lyot mask, obtained by averaging over a 40 pixels strip, are shown in the left panels. Right panels show\nthe corresponding snapshots. The on-axis component B\nof the binary system appears fainted by a factor \u223c 1.7,\nclose to the factor 2 derived from numerical simulations.\nThe partial obscuration of the on-axis star is due to the\nfact that we were using a l = 1 fork-hologram. Total\nobscuration may be mainly achieved with even l values.\nDiscussion and Conclusions \u2013 We demonstrated\nthe feasibility of OV coronagraphy even under very bad\nseeing conditions with ground-based telescopes. Using\nthe lucky imaging technique to improve the quality of our\nimages, we obtained slightly symmetric OV patterns from\non-axis starlight beams and performed a first trial of OV\ncoronagraphy obtaining a fainting close to that that can\nbe actually obtained with our l = 1 fork-hologram. We\ntested how the pattern of polychromatic starlight OVs\ndepends from the off-axis position of the star beam. We\n\n\f4\nport, helpful discussions and comments. This work has\nbeen partly supported by the University of Padova.\n\nFIG. 4: Left panel: the OV obtained by summing the selected\n2% good frames (see text). Left panel: profile of the OV\nacross the direction perpendicular to the dispersion.\n\nFIG. 5: l = 1 OV coronagraphy of HD74010. Left panel: the\naveraged intensity profiles of the double star before (up) and\nafter (down) the insertion of the Lyot stop. Right panel: the\ncorresponding snapshots (see text).\n\nshowed how polychromaticity and the lack of coherence\nproduced by the atmospheric turbulence may heavily alter the theoretical donut profile of the OV reducing the\ncontrast needed for coronagraphy. Although only even\nvalues of l can produce perfect rejection of the on-axis\nstarlight as required for coronagraphy, we decided to start\nwith an l = 1 fork-hologram to ensure the stability of the\nOVs along the optical path. This explains the importance of this choice as a first test of OV coronagraphy.\nWe found that our experimental results are consistent\nwith theoretical predictions. We suggest that these new\npromising techniques could find their best application\nmainly at telescopes with adaptive optics, or in space\ninstruments. Finally, since we did not detect any OV at\nthe other diffraction orders of the hologram, we can conclude that starlight does not have an appreciable intrinsic\nOAM.\nWe would like to thank the Institut f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik, University of Wien, Zeilinger-Gruppe for sup-\n\n[1] L.
