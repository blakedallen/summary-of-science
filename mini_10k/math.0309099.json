This\nallows to enlarge the concept of anomaly in classical dynamical systems considered by\nF Toppan in [J. Nonlinear Math. Phys. 8, Nr. 3 (2001), 518\u2013533] so as to encompass\nsome extensions of Lie algebras related to noncanonical actions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of anomalies in classical dynamical systems was considered by F Toppan in\na recent paper [7]. This concept allowed him to establish interesting re-interpretations of\nsome relevant results.\nThe general situation he discusses is the following: the momentum mappings associated\nto a canonical action of a Lie group G on a classical system (the Noether charges) yield\na nontrivial central extension of Lie(G), the Lie algebra of G.\nThe aim of this paper is to generalize this kind of ideas in order to encompass some\nnoncanonical actions of Lie Groups on classical systems that give rise to representations\nof extensions of Lie(G). These extensions are in general noncentral.\nOur approach is based on the introduction and analysis of a two cocycle on Lie(G)\nassociated to any action of G on a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9). This cocycle takes values in\nC \u221e (M ), but, if the action of G is symplectic, its evaluation at any point in M yields a real\nvalued two cocycle which is cohomologous to the cocycle defining the central extension\nmentioned above (see, for instance, [1] or [8]).\nThe generalization we propose will allow us to consider in our context an example\ninvolving the Mickelsson\u2013Fadeev cocycle by means of classical objects. This cocycle is\nassociated to the quantum anomalous commutator of the constraints of the Gauss-law in\na (3 + 1)-dimensional Yang\u2013Mills theory interacting with Weyl fermions and it was first\n\nCopyright c 2003 by J E Solomin and M Zuccalli\n\n\f2\n\nJ E Solomin and M Zuccalli\n\ncomputed by L Fadeev by using path-integral techniques [4] (and also by cohomological ones [3]). Almost simultaneously, J Mickelsson constructed a representation of the\nextension of the current algebra associated to this cocycle by using topological techniques.\nIn fact, we shall see that the Mickelsson\u2013Fadeev cocycle is cohomologous, modulo constants, to the cocycle associated to the action of the gauge group on the classical system\ndefined by the effective lagrangian.\n\n2\n\nThe canonical two-cocycle and the momentum maps\n\nIn this section we consider a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) and an action of a Lie group G\non M which is not assumed to be symplectic. This action induces a natural action of G\non the space C \u221e (M ):\n\u0001\n(g * f )(x) = f g\u22121 * x , \u2200g \u2208 G.\nThe derivative of this action produces a nontrivial action of Lie(G) on C \u221e (M ) by\na * f = \u2212LX\u0303a f,\nwith X\u0303a the infinitesimal generator associated to a \u2208 Lie(G) and L the Lie derivative.\nUnder such action C \u221e (M ) becomes a Lie(G)-module. In general, Lie(G) acts on all\ndifferential forms on M in the same way: a * \u03b1 = \u2212LX\u0303a \u03b1.\nIn order to define the cohomology of Lie(G) with coefficients in C \u221e (M ), the standard\ncoboundary operator is introduced:\n(\u03b4\u03b1)(a1 , . . . , an+1 ) =\n\nn+1\nX\n\n(\u22121)(i+1) ai * \u03b1(a1 , . . . , a\u02c6i , . . . , an+1 )\n\ni=0\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03b1([ai , aj ], a1 , . . . , a\u02c6i , . . . , a\u02c6j , . . . , an+1 )\n\ni<j\n\nwhere \u03b1 is one n cochain on Lie(G) with values in C \u221e (M ) (i.e. an alternate multilineal\nmap), a1 , a2 , . . . , an+1 \u2208 Lie(G), the symbol ' \u02c6 ' meaning that the variable under it has\nbeen deleted and the symbol ' * ' denoting the action of Lie(G) on C \u221e (M ).\nThe space Z n (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )) of n-cocycles consists of n cochain \u03b1 with \u03b4\u03b1 = 0 and\nthe space B n (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )) of n-coboundaries consists of n cochain such that exists\nsome (n \u2212 1) cochain \u03b2 with \u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b2.\nZ n (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )\n.\nThe cohomology groups are defined as H n (Lie(G), C \u221e ) = n\nB (Lie(G), C \u221e (M ))\nIt is well known that the second cohomology group H 2 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )) is related to\nthe extensions of Lie(G) by C \u221e (M ).\nThe semidirect sum of Lie(G) and C \u221e (M ) consists of pairs (a, f ) \u2208 Lie(G) \u00d7 C \u221e (M )\nwith the Lie commutator\n[(a, f ), (b, g)] = ([a, b], a * f \u2212 b * g).\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 H 2 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )). We can try to define a modified commutator by\n[(a, f ), (b, g)]\u03b1 = ([a, b], a * f \u2212 b * g + \u03b1(a, b)].\n\n\fNoncentral Extensions as Anomalies in Classical Dynamical Systems\n\n3\n\n(The Jacobi identity for the modifed commutator is easily seen to be equivalent to the\ncocycle condition \u03b4\u03b1 = 0.)\nSo, each \u03b1 \u2208 H 2 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )) defines a new Lie algebra.\nLet \u03b11 and \u03b12 \u2208 Z 2 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )). The Lie algebras formed from these cocycles are isomorphic through a mapping of the type \u03c6(a, f ) = (a, f + \u03b2(a)), where \u03b2 \u2208\nH 1 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )).\nThe condition\n[\u03c6(a, f ), \u03c6(b, g)]\u03b11 = \u03c6([(a, f ), (b, g)]\u03b12 )\nis the same as \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = \u03b4\u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2208 H 1 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )) (i.e. \u03b11 and \u03b12 are cohomologous: \u03b11 \u2243 \u03b12 ).\nThus, up to an isomorphism of the above type the Lie algebra extensions are parametrized by elements of H 2 (Lie(G), C \u221e (M )).\nReal valued cocycles and coboundaries can be recovered from the previous construction\njust by considerig real valued cochains as constant functions.\nNow, we introduce the C \u221e (M )-valued two-cocycle on Lie(G) canonically associated to\nthe action of G mentioned above.\nProposition 1. Let \u03a9(a, b)(x) = \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303b )(x) \u2200 a, b \u2208 Lie(G) and x \u2208 M . Then, \u03a9 is\na C \u221e (M )-valued two-cocycle on Lie(G).\nProof.\n(\u03b4\u03a9)(a, b, c) = a * \u03a9(b, c) \u2212 b * \u03a9(a, c) + c * \u03a9(a, b)\n\u2212 \u03a9([a, b], c) + \u03a9([a, c], b) \u2212 \u03a9([b, c], a)\n= \u2212La \u03c9(X\u0303b , X\u0303c ) + LX\u0303b \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303c ) \u2212 LX\u0303c \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303b )\n\u2212 \u03c9(X\u0303c , X\u0303[a,b] ) + \u03c9(X\u0303b , X\u0303[a,c] ) \u2212 \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303[b,c] )\n= \u2212X\u0303a \u03c9(X\u0303b , X\u0303c ) + \u03c9([X\u0303a , X\u0303b ], X\u0303c ) + \u03c9(X\u0303b , [X\u0303a , X\u0303c ])\n+ X\u0303b \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303c ) \u2212 \u03c9([X\u0303b , X\u0303a ], X\u0303c ) \u2212 \u03c9(X\u0303a , [X\u0303b , X\u0303c ])\n\u2212 X\u0303c \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303b ) + \u03c9([X\u0303c , X\u0303a ], X\u0303b ) + \u03c9(X\u0303a , [X\u0303c , X\u0303b ])\n\u2212 \u03c9([X\u0303a , X\u0303b ], X\u0303c ) + \u03c9([X\u0303a , X\u0303c ], X\u0303b ) \u2212 \u03c9([X\u0303b , X\u0303c ], X\u0303a )\n= \u2212X\u0303a \u03c9(X\u0303b , X\u0303c ) + X\u0303b \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303c ) \u2212 X\u0303c \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303b )\n+ \u03c9([X\u0303a , X\u0303b ], X\u0303c ) \u2212 \u03c9([X\u0303a , X\u0303c ], X\u0303b ) + \u03c9([X\u0303b , X\u0303c ], X\u0303a )\n= \u22123(d\u03c9)(X\u0303a , X\u0303b , X\u0303c ) = 0,\nwhere d denotes the usual exterior differential operator.\nDefinition. The cocycle\n\u03a9(a, b)(x) = \u03c9(X\u0303a , X\u0303b )(x)\nwill be called the canonical cocycle associated to the action of G on (M, \u03c9).\n\n\u0004\n\n\f4\n\nJ E Solomin and M Zuccalli\n\nThus, each action of G on M yields an extension of Lie(G) by C \u221e (M ).\nWhen the action of G is symplectic, \u03a9(a, b)(x) and \u03a9(a, b)(x0 ) are cohomologous as\nreal valued two cocycles on Lie(G) for every x, x0 \u2208 M . Then, in this case, the element\n[\u03a9(a, b)(x)] in H 2 (Lie(G), R) is independent of x. We shall denote it by \u03a9\u0303(a, b). In this\nway, a central extension of Lie(G) can be defined.\nOn the other hand, assuming, as henceforth we shall do for the symplectic actions to\nbe considered, that the action of G admits momentum mappings Ja (that is, for each\na \u2208 Lie(G) there exists Ja \u2208 C \u221e (M ) such that dJa = iX\u0303a \u03c9), \u2200 a, b \u2208 Lie(G) the function\n\u03a3(a, b)(x) := {Ja , Jb }(x) \u2212 J[a,b] (x),\nwith { , } the Poisson bracket associated to \u03c9, turns out to be constant on M and, as\na function of (a, b), it is a real valued two cocycle on Lie(G) [1, 8]. This cocycle will be\ndenoted by \u03a3\u0303(a, b).\nSince for any x0 \u2208 M , J[a,b] (x0 ) is trivial in H 2 (Lie(G), R), then \u03a3\u0303(a, b) is equivalent\nto {Ja , Jb }(x0 ) = \u03a9(a, b)(x0 ) in this cohomology. Hence, as real two cocycles on Lie(G),\n{Ja , Jb }(x) \u2212 J[a,b] (x) \u2243 \u03a9\u0303(a, b).\nThus, for symplectic actions, the momenta give rise to a representation of the central\nextension of Lie(G) determined by \u03a9\u0303(a, b).\nAccording to F Toppan [7], an anomaly appears in a classical dynamical system when\nthe central extension associated to a symplectic action of G on (M, \u03c9) is nontrivial. Let\nus recall that a necessary condition for it to occur is that symplectic potentials are not\npreserved by the action [1].\nNow, for a not necessarily symplectic action of G, we shall show that, under some\nadditional hypotheses, the extension of Lie(G) defined by \u03a9 can still be represented by\nthe Poisson brackets of some functions associated to the action of G.\nMore precisely, we shall see that if \u03c9 can be written as\n\u03c9 = \u03c9i + \u2206\u03c9\nwith \u03c9i G-invariant and \u2206\u03c9 a closed form (not necessarily non-degenerate) on M such\nthat LX\u0303a \u03c9 = LX\u0303a \u2206\u03c9 and if Ja are momentum maps corresponding to the symplectic\naction of G on (M, \u03c9i ), we have\nProposition 2.

The additional hypothesis in the previous proposition is obviously fulfilled\nby any symplectic action since, in this case, \u2206Xa = 0 \u2200 a \u2208 Lie(G). Then, as a C \u221e (M )valued two cocycle on Lie (G),\n\u03a3(a, b)(x) := {Ja , Jb }(x) \u2212 J[a,b] (x) \u2243 \u03a9(b, a)(x).\nOn the other hand, as mentioned above, \u03a3(a, b)(x) is constant on M and, as real valued\ncocycle,\n\u03a3\u0303(a, b) = [\u03a3(a, b)(x)] \u2243 \u03a9(b, a)(x),\n\u2212\u03a3\u0303(a, b) = \u2212[\u03a3(a, b)(x)].\nNevertheless, the opposite signs do not yield a contradiction. In fact, from the proof of\nProposition 2 we have\n\u03a3\u0303(a, b) = {Ja , Jb }(x0 ) \u2212 J[a,b] (x0 ) = \u03a9(a, b)(x0 ) + (\u03b4J)(a, b)(x0 )\n= \u03a9(a, b)(x0 ) + 2\u03c9i (X\u0303a , X\u0303b )(x0 ) \u2212 J[a,b] (x0 ) = \u03a9(a, b)(x0 ) \u2212 J[a,b] (x0 ).\nTo wit,\n\u03a3\u0303(a, b) \u2212 \u03c9i (X\u0303a , X\u0303b )(x0 ) = \u2212J[a,b] (x0 ).\nSo, in this case, it follows from the Proposition 2 that, as expected,\n\u03a3\u0303(a, b) \u2243 \u03a9\u0303(a, b)\nas real valued cocycles.\n\n\f6\n\nJ E Solomin and M Zuccalli\n\nRemark 2. It is shown in [2] that, under the same hypothesis as in the previous proposition, for any C \u221e -valued two cochain h(a, b) on Lie(G) such that dh(a, b) = (\u03b4\u03b1)(a, b),\n\u03b1(a) being a local symplectic potential of \u2212LX\u0303a \u03c9, the following equality holds:\nd{Ja , Jb } \u2212 dJ[a,b] = dh(a, b),\nand then,\n{Ja , Jb } \u2212 J[a,b] = h(a, b) + c(a, b),\nwith c(a, b) a real valued two cocycle on Lie(G).\nProposition 2 tells us that, by taking h(a, b) = \u03a9(a, b) + (\u03b4J)(a, b), we get rid of c(a, b).\nIt is worth to notice that no explicit expression for h(a, b) nor for c(a, b) is given in [2].\nA simple example.

It is related to the anomalous commutator of the constraints of\nthe Gauss-law appearing in a (3+ 1)-dimensional Yang\u2013Mills theory interacting with Weyl\nfermions.\nFifteen years ago, Faddeev [3] computed this anomalous commutator by means of\nfunctional integration techniques in the following way:\nThe lagrangian of the theory is given by\nL = trF 2 + i\u03c8\u0304DA \u03c8,\nwhere \u03c8 is a Weyl fermion, A \u2208 A, the space of connections on a trivial bundle over the\nmanifold S 4 with structure group SU (3), F = dA is it associated curvture and DA is the\ncovariant operator Dirac coupled to A.\n\n\f8\n\nJ E Solomin and M Zuccalli\n\nThe quantization of the theory is carried out in stages. First, the fermionic path integral\nis computed and then, once the effective lagrangian is obtained, the bosonic integration is\nperformed.\nThe first step yields a result which is not gauge invariant:\nZ\nW [A] = D\u03c8D \u03c8\u0304 exp(i\u03c8\u0304DA \u03c8) = det DA .\nIn fact, since DA is an unbounded operator, its determinant is divergent, a regularizing\nmethod must be applied, and this procedure gives rise to a not gauge invariant result.\nLet us notice that the variation of W [A] coincides with the variation of the Wess\u2013\nZumino\u2013Witten lagrangian and is the integrated anomaly of the theory:\nW [Ag ] = exp(i\u03b11 (A; g))W [A],\nwhere g \u2208 G, the gauge group, and \u03b11 (A; g) is a 1-cocycle on G with values in C \u221e (A).\nNow, for the second step, the lagrangian that must be considered is the effective one:\nLE (A) =\n\n1\ntr F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + W [A].\n2\n\nNow, the constraints of the Gauss-law are just the momenta (i.e. the Noether charges)\nassociated to the action of the gauge group with respect to the original lagrangian.\nBy using the Johnson\u2013Bjrken\u2013Low method [5], Fadeev obtained the noncentral extension of Lie(G) represented by the equal-time commutators of the operators G\u0303a , the\nquantum representants of the momenta Ga :\nc\n[G\u0303a (x), G\u0303b (y)][A] = Cab\nG\u0303c (y)\u03b4(x \u2212 y) + S(a,b) [A](x, y),\n\nwhere S(a,b) [A](x, y) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y) * MF(a,b)\nZ [A] .\n1\nd3 x tr (A[da, db]) is the Mickelsson\u2013Faddeev\nThe two cocycle MF(a,b) [A] =\n24\u03c0 S 3\ncocycle.\nIn order to relate the Mickelsson\u2013Fadeev cocycle to a canonical one, we consider the\nsymplectic manifold (T A, \u03c9LE ), where \u03c9LE is the lagrangian form associated to the effective lagrangian LE .\nNotice that \u03c9LE can be written as \u03c9LE = \u03c9can + \u2206\u03c9E , where \u03c9can is the symplectic\nand gauge-invariant structure associated to LYM = 21 tr F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd .\nLet us consider the momentum map associated to the lift of the action of the gauge\ngroup G on A\ng * A = Ag = g \u22121 Ag + g\u22121 dg\nto (T A, \u03c9can ).\nThese maps Ga : T A \u2192 R are given by dGa = iX\u0303a \u03c9can \u2200 a \u2208 Lie(G) where X\u0303a is the\ninfinitesimal generator associated to a \u2208 Lie(G).\nAs mentioned above, these maps are the constraints of the Gauss-law [4].\nLet us consider the cocycle \u03a9\u03c9LE defined on Lie(G) with values in the Lie(G)-module\nC \u221e (T A) canonically associated to the action de G on A.\nThe following lemma shows that the additional hypothesis is fulfilled in this case.\n\n\fNoncentral Extensions as Anomalies in Classical Dynamical Systems\n\n9\n\nLemma.
