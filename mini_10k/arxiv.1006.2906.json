The quantization conditions are formulated in terms of solutions\nto a nonlinear integral equation similar to the ones coming from the thermodynamic Bethe\nansatz. This is equivalent to extremizing a certain function called Yang's potential.

Above, pl and xk are quantum observables satisfying the\ncanonical commutation relations [pl , xk ] = i~\u03b4l,k , g and \u03ba are coupling constant. When \u03ba = 1\none deals with the so-called closed Toda chain and, when \u03ba = 0, with the open Toda chain.\nThis model appears to be a prototype for an interesting class of integrable models called algebraically integrable models. It was introduced and solved, on the classical level, by Toda\n[To] in 1967. Then, in 1977, Olshanetsky and Perelomov [OP] constructed the set of N commuting and independent integrals of motion for the closed chain, thus proving the so-called\nquantum integrability of the model. In 1980-81, Gutzwiller [Gu] was able to build explicitly\nthe eigenfunctions and write down the quantization conditions for small numbers of particles\n1\n\n\f(N = 2, 3, 4). In particular he expressed the eigenfunctions of the closed chain with N-sites as\na linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the open chain with N \u2212 1 particles.\nA particularly succesful approach to the solution of the quantum Toda chain was initiated by\nSklyanin. In 1985, Sklyanin applied the quantum inverse scattering method (QISM) to the study\nof the Toda chain. This led to the development of the so-called quantum separation of variables\nmethod. In this novel framework, he was able to obtain the Baxter equations for the model,\nfrom which Gutzwiller's quantization conditions can be obtained. The Baxter equation was\nlater re-derived by Pasquier and Gaudin [GP] with the help of an explicit construction of the\nso-called Q-operator, similar to the method developed by Baxter for the solution of the eight\nvertex model [Ba].\nIn '99 Kharchev and Lebedev [KL] constructed the multiple integral representations for the\neigenfunctions of the closed N-particle Toda chain. Their construction can be seen as a generalization of Gutzwiller's solution allowing one to express the eigenfunctions of the closed\nN-particle Toda chain in terms of those of the open chain with N \u2212 1 particles for all N. In '09,\nAn [An] completed the picture by proving rigorously that Gutzwiller's quantization conditions\nare necessary and sufficient for obtaining a state in the spectrum.\nHowever, the form of the quantization conditions obtained in the above-mentioned works appears to be rather involved. Recently Nekrasov and Shatashvili proposed in [NS] that the quantization conditions for the Toda chain can be reformulated in terms of the solutions to a nonlinear\nintegral equation (NLIE) similar to the equations originating in the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz\nmethod. With the help of the solutions to the relevant nonlinear integral equation, Nekrasov and\nShatashvili defined a function W whose critical points are in a one-to-one correspondence with\nthe simultaneous eigenstates of the conserved quantitites. This formulation not only seems to be\nin some respects more efficient than the previous one, it also indicates an amazing universality\nof the form the quantization conditions may take in integrable models.\nThe proposal of [NS] was based on rather indirect arguments coming from the study of supersymmetric gauge theories. It seems desirable to derive the proposal more directly from the\nintegrable structure of the model. Our main aim in this note is to give such a derivation. It\nis obtained from the solution theory of the Baxter equation. In other integrable models there\nare known connections between the Baxter equation and nonlinear integral equations that look\nsimilar to the one that appears here, see e.g. [BLZ, Za, Te]. However, the precise form of the\nNLIE depends heavily on the analytic properties that the relevant solutions of the Baxter equation must have in the different models. In the present case of a particle system we encounter\nan interesting new feature: the quantization conditions are not formulated as equations on the\nzeros of the solutions of the Baxter equation, but instead, they are equations on the poles of\nthe so-called quantum Wronskian formed from two linearly independent solutions of the Bax-\n\n2\n\n\fter equation. The positions \u03b4 = (\u03b41 , . . . , \u03b4N ) of these poles are the variables that the Yang's\npotential W = W(\u03b4) depends on.\nIt is worth stressing that the Baxter equation or generalizations thereof have a good chance to\nfigure as a universal tool for the study of the spectrum of quantum integrable models. Our\nmethod of derivation strongly indicates that similar formulations of the quantization conditions\nshould exist for large classes of quantized algebraically integrable models.\nThis article is organized as follows. We first recall how the Separation of Variables method\nreduces the problem to find the eigenstates of the Toda chain to the problem to find a certain set\nof solutions to the Baxter functional equation specified by strong conditions on the analyticity\nand the asymptotics of its elements. Then, in Section 3 we explain how Gutzwiller's quantization conditions can be reformulated in terms of the solutions to a certain NLIE and in terms of\nthe Yang's potential W(\u03b4). The derivation of this reformulation is sketched. The proofs of our\nclaims are presented in the Appendices. In Appendix A, we establish the relevant properties of\nGutzwiller's basis of fundamental solutions to the T-Q equation. Then in Appendix B we prove\nthe existence and uniqueness of solutions to the NLIE introduced in Section 3. In Appendix C\nwe give rigorous proofs of the main results presented in Section 3.\nAcknowledgements.

Thus, the set of\n\u03ba-twisted monodromy matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\nM (\u03bb) =\nLN (\u03bb) . . . L1 (\u03bb) .\n(2.2)\n0 \u03ba~\nallows one to build the transfer matrix T (\u03bb) = tr [M (\u03bb)] which is the generating function of\nthe set of N commuting Hamiltonians associated with the Toda chain\nN\n\nT (\u03bb) = \u03bb +\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n3\n\n(\u22121)k \u03bbN \u2212k Hk .\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fThe first two Hamiltonians read\n( N\n)\nN\nN\nX p2\nX\nX\nP2\nl\n\u2212\n+ g 2~ \u03ba~ exN \u2212x1 +\ng 2~ exk\u22121 \u2212xk . (2.4)\nH1 =\npk = P\nH2 =\n2\n2\nl=1\nk=2\nk=1\nQ\nAny eigenvector of the transfer matrix defines a polynomial t (\u03bb) = N\nk=1 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4k ). The N\ncommuting Hamiltonians are self-adjoint, hence the set {\u03c4 } is necessarily self conjugated:\n{\u03c4k } = {\u03c4 k }.\n\n2.2 Separation of variables\nThe Separation of Variables (SOV) method was developed for the Toda chain in [Sk, GP, KL,\nAn]. The main results of these works may be summarized as follows:\nThe wave-functions \u03a8t (x), x = (x1 , . . . , xN ) of any eigenstate to the transfer matrix T(\u03bb) with\neigenvalue t(\u03bb) can be represented by means of an integral transformation of the form\nZ\n\u03a8t (x) =\nd\u03bc(\u03b3) \u03a6t (\u03b3) \u039eP (\u03b3|x) ,\n(2.5)\nRN\u22121\n\nwhere integration is over vectors \u03b3 = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N \u22121) \u2208 RN \u22121 with respect to a measure d\u03bc(\u03b3)\nfirst found in [Sk], \u039eP (\u03b3|x) is an integral kernel for which the explicit expression can be found\nin [KL], P is the eigenvalue of the center of mass momentum P in the state \u03a8t , and \u03a6t (\u03b3) is the\nwave-function in the so-called SOV-representation. The key feature of the SOV representation\nis that \u03a6t (\u03b3) takes a factorized form\n\u03a6t (\u03b3) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\nqt (\u03b3k ) .\n\n(2.6)\n\nk=1\n\nThe integral transformation (2.5) is constructed in such a way that the eigenvalue equation for\nthe family of operators T(\u03bb) is equivalent to the fact that the function qt (y) which represents\nthe state \u03a8t via (2.5) and (2.6) satisfies the so-called Baxter equation,\nt(\u03bb)qt (\u03bb) = iN g N ~ qt (\u03bb + i~) + \u03ba~ (\u2212i)N g N ~ qt (\u03bb \u2212 i~) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe integral transformation (2.5) can be inverted to express \u03a6t (\u03b3) in terms of \u03a8t (x). In this\nway it becomes possible to find the necessary and sufficient conditions that qt (y) has to satisfy\nin order to represent an eigenstate of T(\u03bb) via (2.5) and (2.6). The conditions are [KL, An]\nQ\n(i) t(\u03bb) is a polynomial of the form t(\u03bb) = N\nk=1 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4k ), with {\u03c4k } = {\u03c4 k }.\n\u0001\nN\nN\u03c0\n(ii) q(\u03bb) is entire and has asymptotic behavior |q (\u03bb)| = O e\u2212 2~ |R(\u03bb)| |\u03bb| 2~ (2|I(\u03bb)|\u2212~) .\n\nAbove, the O symbol is uniform in the strip {z : |I (z)| \u2264 ~/2}. This reduces the problem to\nconstruct all the eigenfunctions and finding the complete spectrum of the Toda chain to finding\nthe set S of all solutions (t (\u03bb) , qt (\u03bb)) to the Baxter equation (2.7) that satisfy the conditions\n(i) and (ii) above.\n4\n\n\f3 Quantization conditions\nIt turns out that the Baxter equation (2.7) admits solutions within the class S described above\nonly for a discrete set of choices for the polyonomial t(\u03bb). This is what expresses the quantization of the spectrum of T(\u03bb) within the SOV-framework. Our first aim in this section will be\nto outline how to reformulate the resulting conditions on t(\u03bb) more concretely, following the\napproaches initiated by Gutzwiller and Pasquier-Gaudin.\nIt gives useful insight to divide the problem to construct and classify the solutions to the Baxter\nequation (2.7) which satisfy (i) and (ii) into in two steps. In the first step, one weakens the\nanalytic requirements (ii) on q(\u03bb) slightly by allowing q(\u03bb) to have a certain number of poles.\nIn this case, it will be possible to find two linearly independent solutions qt\u00b1 (\u03bb) to (2.7) for\narbitrary t(\u03bb) satisfying (i). In the second step, one constructs the solution q(\u03bb) satisfying (i)\nand (ii) in the form\nq(\u03bb) = P+ qt+ (\u03bb) + P\u2212 qt\u2212 (\u03bb) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere P\u00b1 are constants. The requirement that q(\u03bb) is entire means that the poles of qt\u00b1 (\u03bb) must\ncancel each other in (3.1) which is only possible if t(\u03bb) is fine-tuned in a suitable way. This is\nthe origin of the quantization of the spectrum of T(\u03bb).\n\n3.1 Gutzwiller's formulation of the quantization conditions\nIt turns out that there is a canonical minmal choice for the set of poles of qt\u00b1 (\u03bb) that one needs\nto allow. One needs to allow N poles \u03b41 , . . . , \u03b4N whose positions are determined by the choice\nof t(\u03bb). More precisely, out of t(\u03bb) one constructs the so-called Hill determinant\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef ...\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef ...\n\uf8ef\nH (\u03bb) = det \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef ...\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n..\n.\n\n..\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n~\n\n\u03c1\nt (\u03bb \u2212 i~)\n0\n..\n\n.\n\n1\n\u03c1~\nt (\u03bb)\n..\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n1\nt (\u03bb \u2212 i~)\n1\n..\n\n.\n\n...\n\n\uf8f9\n\n... \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n0\n... \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa ,\n\uf8fa\n1\n0... \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nt (\u03bb)\n\uf8fb\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03c1 := \u03bag 2N . It can be shown that H(\u03bb) admits the representation\n\u03c0\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4a )\n~\nH (\u03bb) =\n,\n\u03c0\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n)\nsinh\na=1\na\n~\nN sinh\nY\n\nwhere one chooses |I (\u03b4k )| < ~/2.

On the other hand, it also ensures that the residues of\nthe possible poles of t\u03b4 (3.16) vanish. Then, the polynomiality of t\u03b4 is a consequence of the\nasymptotic behavior of the functions Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 . The details of the arguments are found in Appendix\nC.\nIn order to see how the quantum Wronskian relation is connected to the NLIE (3.9), let us,\nstarting from a solution Y\u03b4 (\u03bb) to (3.9), introduce two functions v\u2191 (\u03bb) and v\u2193 (\u03bb) via (3.11).

This implies that all functions Y\u03b4 (\u03bb) needed for the\nformulation of the quantization conditions (3.13) can be obtained in this way.\nLet us finally note that there is a more direct way (cf.

This may be seen as a hint towards a more direct understanding of the claim in [NS] that\nthe quantization conditions for large classes of quantized algebraically integrable models can\nbe formulated in this way. The claim should follow quite generally from the solution theory of\nthe Baxter equation.\n\nA Properties of Gutzwiller's solutions\nA.1\n\nAnalytic properties of Gutzwiller's solution\n\nThe explicit construction of a set of two linearly independent entire solutions Q\u00b1\nt of (2.7) with\narbitrary monic polynomial t (\u03bb) goes back to Gutzwiller [Gu]. Prior to writing down these two\nsolutions, recall the definition of the Wronskian of two solutions q1 and q2 defined by\nW [q1 , q2 ] (\u03bb) = q1 (\u03bb) q2 (\u03bb + i~) \u2212 q2 (\u03bb) q1 (\u03bb + i~) .\n\n(A.1)\n\nIt is straightforward to see, using (2.7), that W [q1 , q2 ] is i~ quasi-periodic:\nW [q1 , q2 ] (\u03bb + i~) = (\u22121)N \u03ba~ W [q1 , q2 ] (\u03bb) .\n\n(A.2)\n\nQ\nProposition 1.

The fact that Q\u00b1\nt are linearly independent is a consequence of the fact that their Wronskian does not vanish identically. The explicit expression for this Wronskian follows after some\nalgebra.\n\nAs we have assumed that the set {\u03c4k } is self-conjugated, it follows from the determinant repre\u0001\nsentation for H that H \u03bb = H (\u03bb), ie, the set {\u03b4k } is self-conjugated. In its turn, this implies\na particular relation between the set of \u03b4's and \u03c4 's. Namely, computing the R (\u03bb) \u2192 +\u221e\nasymptotics of H yields\nN\nX\n\n\u03c4p =\n\np=1\n\nHowever, as\n\nP\n\n\u03c4k \u2208 R and\n\nP\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b4p + in~ ,\n\nfor some\n\nn\u2208N.\n\n(A.8)\n\np=1\n\n\u03b4k \u2208 R, the only possibility is n = 0 .\n\nWe are now in position to prove the\nLemma 2.

Hence, we get that qe (\u03bb) 6= 0 only at an at most countable set. As qe (\u03bb)\nis meromorphic on C, qe = 0.\nWe now provide a rough characterization of the set of zeroes of Q\u00b1\nt . As the \u0393 function has no\n\u00b1\nzeroes on C, the only zeroes of Qt are those of K\u00b1 (\u03bb).\n\nProposition 2. Assume that |I (\u03c4k )| < ~/2 and that the set {\u03c4k } is invariant under complex conjugation. Then, the set of zeroes of K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) belongs to the half-plane\n{z \u2208 C : I (z) < \u2212~/2} and\n|K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)|2\n> 1,\nH (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)\n\nfor \u03bb \u2208 R .\n\n(A.13)\n\nA similar statement holds for K\u2212 (\u03bb + i~/2), namely the set of zeroes of K\u2212 (\u03bb + i~/2) lies in\nthe half-plane {z \u2208 C : I (z) > +~/2} and K\u2212 (\u03bb + i~/2) does not vanish on R.\nProof. It follows from the determinant representations that K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) has poles at \u03c4k \u2212\ni (2n + 1) ~/2, n \u2208 N, in particular they all belong to the half-plane {z \u2208 C : I (z) < \u2212~/2}.\nAlso, since the zeroes and poles of the Hill determinant are self-conjugated,\n\u03c0\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4k )\n~\n>0 ,\nH (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) =\n\u03c0\ncosh\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n)\nk\nk=1\n~\nN cosh\nY\n\n\u2200\u03bb \u2208 R .\n\n(A.14)\n\nAs the set {\u03c4k } is self-conjugate, it is easy to see that\nK+ (\u03bb) = K\u2212 \u03bb\n\n\u0001\n\nand\n\nt (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) t (\u03bb + i~/2) = |t (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)|2 ,\n12\n\n(A.15)\n\n\fThis allows us to rewrite (A.7) in the form\n|K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)|2\n\u03c1~\nK+ (\u03bb + i~/2)\n=1+\nH (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)\nH (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) t (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(A.16)\n\nIt follows from (A.14) and (A.16) that there exists a c > 0 such that |K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)| > c for\n\u03bb \u2208 R. Hence, K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) has no zeroes on R. As K+ (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) has manifestly no poles\nin the half-plane {z : I (z) > \u2212~/2}, one has that\nf (\u03c1) =\n\nZ\n\nR\u2212i~/2\n\n\u001a\n~\nd\u03c4 K+\u2032 (\u03c4 )\n= # z \u2208 C : I (z) > \u2212\n2i\u03c0 K+ (\u03c4 )\n2\n\nand\n\nK+ (z) = 0\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n(A.17)\n\nHere, we remind that \u03c1 is the deformation parameter appearing in (3.6). We also specify that\nthe function f (\u03c1) is well defined as |K+ ||R\u2212i~/2 > c and the ratio K+\u2032 /K+ decays at least as\n\u03bb\u2212(2N +1) at infinity, uniformly in \u03c1, cf lemma 3. Thus, applying the dominated convergence\ntheorem we obtain that f (\u03c1) is continuous in \u03c1. As it is integer valued, it is constant. The value\nof this constant is fixed from f (0) = 0 (as then K+ = 1). This shows that K+ (\u03bb) has all of its\nzeros lying below the line R \u2212 i~/2.\n\nA.2\n\nBounds for K+\n\nLemma 3.

As the T-Q equations can be solved explicitly when N = 1 in terms of Bessel functions,\nit is enough to consider the case N \u2265 2.

The function ln Yt defined in (B.1) is continuous, positive and bounded on R. It\nis the unique solution in this class to the non-linear integral equation (3.9).\n\nProof. We first prove the uniqueness of solutions. Let k*k\u221e stand for the sup norm on bounded\nand continuous functions on R. We set F = {f \u2208 C 0 (R) : f \u2265 0 and kf k\u221e < +\u221e}.\nThen we define the operator L on F by\nL [f ] (\u03bb) =\n\nZ\nR\n\n\u0012\nd\u03bc K (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc) ln 1 +\n\n\u03c1~ ef (\u03bc)\n|\u03b8 (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2)|2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(B.2)\n\nThe mapping L stabilizes F .

We shall now prove that L can\nhave at most one fixed point. This settles the question of uniqueness of solutions to (3.9). This\npart goes as in [FKS]. Let f, g \u2208 F , then\nZ1 Z\n|L [f ] \u2212 L [g]| (\u03bb) = dt d\u03c4 K (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4 )\n0\n\nR\n\n\u03c1~ eg(\u03c4 )+t(f \u2212g)(\u03c4 )\n(f \u2212 g) (\u03c4 )\n|\u03b8 (\u03c4 + i~/2)|2 + \u03c1~ eg(\u03c4 )+t(f \u2212g)(\u03c4 )\n\n\u03c1~ emax(kgk\u221e ,kf k\u221e )\nkf \u2212 gk\u221e < kf \u2212 gk\u221e . (B.4)\n\u2264\nJ + \u03c1~ emax(kgk\u221e ,kf k\u221e )\nHence, L admits a unique fixed point.\nA direct proof of existence of the solutions to (3.9) is possible if \u03c1~ /J < 1. In this case it is\neasily seen that L [f ] (\u03bb) is a bounded mapping in the sense that it stabilizes all balls in F of\n\u0001\nradius R \u2265 \u2212 ln 1 \u2212 \u03c1~ /J . In such a case, (B.4) implies that L [f ] is a contractive map on a\nBanach space. It thus admits a unique fixed point.\nHowever, it is always possible to construct a solution to (3.9) in terms of the the half-infinite\ndeterminants K\u00b1 . Recall that {\u03c4k } and hence {\u03b4k } are invariant under complex conjugation.\n15\n\n\fLet\nv\u2191 (\u03bb) = K+ (\u03bb)\n\nN\nY\n\u0393(1 \u2212 i (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4k ) /~)\n\nk=1\n\nv\u2193 (\u03bb) = K\u2212 (\u03bb + i~)\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 i (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4k ) /~)\n\nN\nY\n\u0393(i (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4k ) /~)\n\n\u0393(i (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4k ) /~)\nk=1\n\n.\n\n(B.5)\n\n(B.6)\n\nIt follows from Proposition 2 that v\u2191/\u2193 (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) are holomorphic and non-vanishing in H+/\u2212 .\nP\nP\nMoreover, as\n\u03b4k =\n\u03c4k , we get that v\u2191/\u2193 (\u03bb \u2212 i~/2) = 1 + O (\u03bb\u22121 ) in their respective\ndomains of holomorphy.

It is readily seen from the asymptotic behavior in the strip {z : |I (z)| < ~} of the\nsolution Y\u03b4 to (3.9), that v\u2191 (\u03bb) \u2192 1 and v\u2191 (\u03bb \u2212 i~) \u2192 1 when R (\u03bb) \u2192 \u00b1\u221e in the strip\n{z : |I (z)| \u2264 ~/2}. Then a straightforward computation leads to (C.1). We assume that all\nthe \u03b4's are distinct and, if necessary, take the limit of coinciding \u03b4's at the end of the calculation.\nIt remains to prove that Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 are entire. For this, we show that the products of \u0393-functions cancel\nthe poles of v\u2191/\u2193 . We need to construct a meromorphic continuation to C of v\u2191/\u2193 starting from\nthe strip B(1) , with B(n) = {z : |I (z)| < n~}. It follows from the very form of the NLIE (3.9)\nthat the solution Y\u03b4 is holomorphic in B(1) .

Therefore, these poles are canceled out by the zeroes of the \u0393-functions and Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 are\nboth entire.\n\nC.2\n\nBaxter equation\n\nProposition 4.

We first assume that the \u03b4k 's are pairwise distinct. The case when several \u03b4k 's coincide\nfollows by taking the limit in the final formulae. As Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 are both entire, we get that the only\npotential poles of t\u03b4 (\u03bb) are located at \u03bb = \u03b4k + in~, n \u2208 Z. The set of zeroes of v\u2191/\u2193 differs\nnecessarily from its set of poles (as follows readily from (C.3) and similar representations for\nv\u2191/\u2193 ). Hence, Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 (\u03b4k + in~) 6= 0, for k = 1, . . . , N and n \u2208 Z. Therefore, it follows from the\nWronskian relation (3.14) , that\nQ+\nQ+\n\u03b4 (\u03b4k + in~)\n\u03b4 (\u03b4k )\n=\n\u2212\nQ\u03b4 (\u03b4k )\nQ\u2212\n\u03b4 (\u03b4k + in~)\n\nfor\n\nk \u2208 [[ 1 ; N ]] and n \u2208 N .\n\n(C.6)\n\nThis implies that the possible poles of the expression in (3.16) get canceled. It follows that t\u03b4 is\nentire. It remains to control its asymptotic behavior. We may express t\u03b4 in terms of v\u2191/\u2193 ,\n\u00012~\nN\nY\n\u03bag 2N v\u2191 (\u03bb + i~) v\u2193 (\u03bb \u2212 2i~)\n.\n(C.7)\nt\u03b4 (\u03bb) = v\u2191 (\u03bb \u2212 i~) v\u2193 (\u03bb)\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4a ) \u2212 N\nQ\n2\u0001\n2\na=1\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4a ) ~ + (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4a )\na=1\n\nDue to the asymptotic behvavior of Y\u03b4 at \u221e, one can deform the integration contour in the definition v\u2191/\u2193 so as to obtain its asymptotic behavior in the whole plane \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, for \u03bb uniformly\naway from the set of poles of v\u2191/\u2193 .\nAs we have that v\u2191/\u2193 \u2192 1 when \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, we get that t\u03b4 \u2243 \u03bbN when \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. Hence, t\u03b4 is a\nmonic polynomial of degree N. It is real valued for \u03bb \u2208 R as for such \u03bb's, V\u03b8 (\u03bb) \u2208 R, what\n\u0001\nimplies that v\u2191 (\u03bb \u2212 i~) = v\u2193 (\u03bb), ie t\u03b4 (\u03bb) = t\u03b4 \u03bb .\n\nThe fact that, in this way, one is able to generate any monic polynomial with roots in the\nstrip {z : |I (z)| < ~/2} follows form the uniqueness of solutions to the TBA-NLIE and the\nconstruction of the function v\u2191/\u2193 in terms of determinants, as given in (B.5)-(B.6).\n18\n\n\fC.3\n\nThe quantization conditions\n\nWe now prove that the quantization conditions for the model (conditions on the zeroes of the\npolynomial t\u03b4 (\u03bb) for (2.7) to have entire solutions with a prescribed decay as given in point (ii))\ncan be written down in a TBA-like form. Moreover, as opposed to the Gutzwiller form of the\nquantization conditions, the ones that will follow only involve one set of parameters. Namely,\nthe zeroes {\u03b4k } of the Hill determinant associated with t\u03b4 (\u03bb) given in (3.16). We show that\nunder certain reasonable assumptions, it is possible to reconstruct the Newton polynomials in\nthe zeroes of t\u03b4 and hence the spectrum of the model. This proves the Nekrasov-Shatashvili\nconjecture [NS]. We first reconstruct the zeroes of t\u03b4 .\nQ\nProposition 5. Let t\u03b4 (\u03bb) = N\np=1 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c4a ) be a polynomial whose zeroes \u03c4k lie in the strip\n{z \u2208 C : |I (z)| < ~/2}. If {\u03b4k } is the associated set of zeroes of the Hill determinant and Y\u03b4\nP\nk\nthe unique solution to the NLIE (3.9), then the Newton polynomials Ek = N\np=1 \u03c4p in the zeroes\nof t\u03b4 are reconstructed by means of formula (3.20) above. The convergence of these integrals is\npart of the conclusion.\nProof. Due to the uniqueness of solutions to the NLIE (3.9), one has that the solution Y\u03b4 can\nbe expressed, as in (B.1) in terms of K\u00b1 , H. The latter determinants are parameterized by the\nzeroes {\u03c4k } of t\u03b4 , and the parameters {\u03b4k } appearing in the NLIE (3.9) coincide with the set of\nzeroes of the Hill determinant. By invoking the continuity of the logarithm on R and its decay\nat infinity, we get\nk\n\nZ\nR\n\n\u0013\no \u0012\n\u03c1~ Y\u03b4 (\u03bc)\nd\u03bc n\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nln 1 +\n(\u03bc + i~/2)\n\u2212 (\u03bc \u2212 i~/2)\n2i\u03c0\n|\u03b8 (\u03bc \u2212 i~/2)|2\n\u0015\nZ\no \u0014 K\u2032\nK\u2212\u2032\nH\u2032\nd\u03bc n\nk\n+\nk\n(\u03bc + i~) \u2212 \u03bc\n=\u2212\n(\u03bc) +\n(\u03bc + i~) \u2212\n(\u03bc)\n2i\u03c0\nK+\nK\u2212\nH\nR\u2212i~/2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nR+i~/2\u2192\nR\u2212i~/2\u2190\n\nN\n\nX\n\u0001\nd\u03bc k H\u2032\n\u03bc\n(\u03bc) =\n\u03c4pk \u2212 \u03b4pk .\n2i\u03c0 H\np=1\n\n(C.8)\n\nIn the intermediate steps, we have used the quick decay at infinity of the integrand\n\u0001\nK\u00b1\u2032\n(\u03bb) = O \u03bb\u22122N \u22121\nK\u00b1\n\nand\n\n\u0001\nH\u2032\n(\u03bb) = O \u03bb\u2212\u221e .\nH\n\n(C.9)\n\nThis allows us to split the integral in three and compute the parts involving K+ , resp. K\u2212 , by\nthe residues in the upper/lower half plane (thus giving 0). Hence, the only part that gives a nontrivial contribution is the contour integral involving H\u2032 /H. The only poles that contribute to the\n19\n\n\fresult are located at the zeroes \u03b4k of the Hill determinant (they have residue +1) and at the poles\n\u03c4k of the Hill determinant (they have residue -1) that are located in the strip |I (z)| < ~/2.\nThis result offers a direct way to recover the spectum of the model from a solution to the TBA\nequation (3.9). It remains to derive the set of quantization conditions on the parameters \u03b4k .\nTheorem 1. There exists a unique entire solution q to the T-Q equation (2.7) whose asymptotic\nbehavior is as stated in (ii) if and only if the parameters {\u03b4k } appearing in the TBA NLIE (3.9)\nsatisfy to the quantization conditions given in (3.13).\nRemark 1. The solvability of the quantization conditions, the occurrence of complex solutions\n( I (\u03b4k ) 6= 0, \u03b4k \u2208 {z : |I (z)| < ~/2}, the uniqueness of solutions for a given choice of\nintegers nk \u2208 Z are all open questions.\nProof. According to lemma 2, any meromorphic solution q to the T-Q equation takes the form\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+\n(\u03bb)\nW q, Q\u2212\n(\u03bb)\nW\nq,\nQ\n\u0002 + \u03b4 \u2212\u0003\n\u0002 + \u03b4 \u2212\u0003\nq (\u03bb) =\n* Q+\n* Q\u2212\n(C.10)\n\u03b4 (\u03bb) \u2212\n\u03b4 (\u03bb) .\nW Q\u03b4 , Q\u03b4 (\u03bb)\nW Q\u03b4 , Q\u03b4 (\u03bb)\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2212\nRecall that the Wronskian W Q+\n\u03b4 , Q\u03b4 (\u03bb) is given by (3.14). It is possible to compute the\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u00b1\nWronskians W q, Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 (\u03bb) by using the asymptotic behavior of q and Q\u03b4 . Due to their i~\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c0\n\u2212N ~ \u03bb \u2212i\u03bb\n\u03ba w\u00b1 (\u03bb), where\nquasi-periodicity, these Wronskians take the form W q, Q\u00b1\n\u03b4 (\u03bb) = e\nw\u00b1 (\u03bb) are entire i~-periodic functions. However, using the asymptotic behavior of q and Q\u00b1\n\u03b4\nwe get that w\u00b1 (\u03bb) are bounded at infinity in the strip |I (\u03bb)| \u2264 ~/2, and hence on C. They are\nthus constant. This proves the uniqueness of solutions for a given choice of \u03c4k 's and hence \u03b4k 's.\nIndeed, up to a normalization constant, any solution q satisfying to the requirements stated in\npoint (ii), is of the form\n+\n\u2212\nN\u03c0\n\u03bb Q\u03b4 (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b6Q\u03b4 (\u03bb)\n~\n(C.11)\nq (\u03bb) = e\nN\nQ\n\u03c0\nsinh (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4k )\n~\nk=1\n\nAs the solution q is entire, it has a vanishing residue at \u03bb = \u03b4k , k = 1 . . . , N. Therefore,\nthe quantization conditions for the Toda chain appear as the set of N \u2212 1 conditions that\nq (\u03bb) has a vanishing residue at \u03b4k , k = 1, . . . , N supplemented with the N th quantization\nPN\nPN\ncondition for the overall momentum :\np=1 \u03c4p =\np=1 \u03b4p = P . Note that it follows from\n\u0002 + \u2212\u0003\nW Q\u03b4 , Q\u03b4 (\u03b4k + in~) = 0 that if q has a vanishing residue at a \u03b4k then it also has a vanishing\nresidue at \u03b4k + in~, n \u2208 Z. Therefore, there is indeed only a finite number N of constraints of\nthe parameters \u03b4. The explicit form of these quantization conditions is then indeed as given in\n(3.13).\nConversely, if the quantization conditions are satisfied, then by taking q as in (C.11), one obtains\nan entire solution with the desired asymptotics.\n20\n\n\fReferences\n[An] D.
