The Serpens cloud covers more than 10 square degrees as mapped by optical extinction\n(Cambr\u00e9sy 1999), but for reasons of practicality the c2d project was only able to observe 1.5\ndeg2 with the MIPS instrument on Spitzer (further Spitzer observations of a larger area of\nSerpens are planned as part of an extended survey of the Gould Belt, Allen 2007, in prep.).\nAt an assumed distance of 260 pc (Straizys, Cernis, & Bartasiute 1996), the area mapped\nby c2d corresponds to \u223c 4.5 \u00d7 7 pc. This paper is one in a series describing the IRAC\nand MIPS observations of each of the c2d clouds. Previous papers include those on IRAC\nobservations of Serpens (Harvey et. al. 2006), Chamaeleon (Porras et al. 2007), and Perseus\n(Jorgensen et al. 2006), as well as MIPS observations of Chamaeleon (Young et al. 2005),\nPerseus (Rebull et al. 2007), Lupus (Chapman et al. 2007), and Ophiuchus (Padgett et al.\n2007).\nOur observations of Serpens cover an area that includes the well studied \"core\" cluster region, Cluster A, together with the newly discovered Cluster B (Harvey et. al. 2006;\nDjupvik et al. 2006) to the south, as well as the Herbig Ae/Be star, VV Ser. Significant\nportions of this cloud have been studied by previous space infrared missions, including IRAS\n(Zhang et al. 1988; Zhang, Laureijs, & Clark 1988) and ISO (Kaas et al. 2004; Djupvik et al.\n2006). The much higher sensitivity and longer wavelength capability of the Spitzer MIPS\ninstrument, however, allows us to detect both very low luminosity infrared-excess objects\nand to map very cool diffuse dust emission in the region. Our results are also complementary\nto the 1.1mm mapping of the same region by Enoch et al. (2007). The combined results on\nSerpens using both the MIPS and IRAC observations are discussed in a companion paper\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwhere we also give detailed object lists (Harvey et al. 2007).\nIn \u00a72 we describe details of the observations obtained from the MIPS instrument for\nSerpens and the data processing pipeline used to reduce the observations. In \u00a73 we describe a\nnumber of results from our MIPS observations and correlations between them and the 2MASS\ncatalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006). We show in \u00a73.1 that there is an excellent correlation between\nthe coolest dust that we can observe which emits at 160\u03bcm and the optical extinction in\nSerpens. We investigate the possibility of time variability at 24\u03bcm in our two-epoch data\nset in \u00a73.2. In \u00a73.3 we discuss our results statistically in terms of source counts and compare\nthese to predictions of models of the Galaxy as well as to the counts in the reference fields.\nWe present color-color and color-magnitude plots of the population of infrared sources in \u00a73.4\nand discuss the separation of likely cloud members from the extensive background population\nof stars and extragalactic objects. In the final part of \u00a73 we briefly describe some details of\nindividual sources of particular interest.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nThe MIPS observations cover an area where Av > 6 in the contour maps of Cambr\u00e9sy\n(1999). In addition, a nearby off-cloud region of 0.5 square degrees was mapped for comparison with the cloud region. A summary of the regions observed is listed in Table 1 with\nthe AOR (Astronomical Observation Request) number to facilitate access from the Spitzer\narchive. The regions covered at 24\u03bcm are outlined in Figure 1 against the 25 \u03bcm IRAS sky.\nThe observing strategy and basic MIPS data analysis for the c2d star-forming clouds have\nbeen described in detail by Rebull et al. (2007), but we summarize here the most important\ndetails. Fast scan maps were obtained at two separate epochs with a spacing between adjacent scan legs of 240\" in each epoch. The second epoch observations were offset by 125\" from\nthe first in the cross-scan direction to fill in the 70\u03bcm sky coverage that would otherwise\nhave been missed due to detector problems. The second epoch scan was also offset 80\" from\nthe first in the scan direction to minimize missing 160\u03bcm data. For some of the c2d clouds,\nthese offsets together with sky rotation were sufficient to give essentially complete one-epoch\ncoverage at 160\u03bcm, but for Serpens there were still small gaps between every two scan lines.\nTable 2 lists the sky coverage at each wavelength. The two observation epochs were separated in time by \u223c 6 hours to allow identification of asteroids in the images; over this time\nperiod asteroids will typically move 0.3 \u2013 2 arcminutes. Because of Serpens' relatively large\necliptic latitude, \u223c 24 degrees, only a very small number of asteroids were seen, all of which\nwere removed by requiring 2-epoch detection in our final source lists. Typical integration\ntimes are 30 seconds at 24\u03bcm, 15 seconds at 70\u03bcm and 3 seconds at 160\u03bcm. Additional GTO\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nobservations east of the region of highest emission are not included in this analysis because a\ndifferent observing strategy was used. Those observations could, however, be added to ours\nin order to construct a somewhat larger mosaic of the region.\nFigure 2 shows the three individual images produced for the MIPS bands as well as\na false color image of the three together. Harvey et al. (2007) show an additional image\ncombining the 24\u03bcm data with IRAC observations as well as enlargements of the two main\nclusters observed. Note that unlike the IRAC instrument, the three wavelengths of MIPS\nall have diffraction limited spatial resolution which means the resolution varies dramatically\nbetween 24\u03bcm (\u223c 6\") and 160\u03bcm (\u223c 40\").\nOur data reduction is described in detail by Evans et al. (2007) but we summarize\nthe important details here. In addition, previous versions of the c2d pipeline, some of\nwhich still apply to these data, have been described in more detail by Rebull et al. (2007)\nand Young et al. (2005). We began our data reduction with the BCD images, processed\nin this case by the standard SSC S13.2 pipeline. Following this the three MIPS channels\nunderwent slightly different processing paths in our c2d reduction. The 24\u03bcm data were\nmosaicked with the SSC's Mopex software (Makovoz & Marleau 2005) after processing in\nthe c2d pipeline to reduce artifacts, e.g. \"jailbars\" near bright sources. Point sources were\nextracted with \"c2dphot\" (Harvey et al. in prep.), a source extractor based on \"Dophot\"\n(Schechter, Mateo, & Saha 1993), which utilizes the mosaics for source identification but the\nstack of individual BCD's for each identified object to provide the photometry and position\ninformation. We have estimated our completeness limit at 24\u03bcm in a manner similar to that\ndescribed for our IRAC photometry (Harvey et. al. 2006). We inserted a number of artificial\nsources into the 24\u03bcm mosaic at random positions over a range of brightness covering the\nrange 2 < [24] < 12 mag. and then tested whether they were properly extracted. We also\nproduced a mosaic with only artificial sources (no real ones) but a noise level comparable\nto that in the observed image, and tested the completeness of extraction from that artificial\nimage to estimate the effects of confusion in this relatively high source density region. Figure\n3 shows the results from these tests. Clearly at the fainter flux levels, the effects of high\nsource density are important to the true completeness level in Serpens, e.g. [24] > 9.5 mag.\nThe processing of the 70\u03bcm data followed a path similar to that at 24\u03bcm with two\nexceptions. At 70\u03bcm the SSC produces two sets of BCD's, one of which is simply calibrated\nand another that is filtered spatially and temporally in a manner that makes point source\nidentification easier but which does not conserve flux for brighter sources nor for diffuse emission. We produced mosaics of both the unfiltered and the filtered products using Mopex on\nthe native BCD pixel scale. Point sources were extracted using APEX (Makovoz & Marleau\n2005). Source reality was checked by hand inspection and comparison with the 24\u03bcm source\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nlist. Generally the filtered mosaics were used for point source extraction, but above F(70) \u223c\n2 Jy, we used the unfiltered data. Above F(70) \u223c 23 Jy, sources begin to be saturated. At\nthese very high flux levels we used a procedure to fit the wings of the source profile; these\ndata have been assigned a higher uncertainty of because of the inherent uncertainties in this\nprocedure.\nComplete tables of source positions and flux densities for likely cloud members in Serpens are given by Harvey et al. (2007) for our 3.6 \u2013 70\u03bcm observations. At 160\u03bcm our\nprocessing was limited to producing a native pixel scale mosaic using interpolation to fill in\nmissing pixels and point source extraction from the unfiltered mosaic. We extracted four\nnominal point sources in the entire mapped area. Two of these are associated with obvious\nmultiple clumps of 24/70\u03bcm sources. The other two, SSTc2dJ1829167+0018225 (associated with IRAS 18267+0016) and SSTc2dJ18293197+0118429 (associated with source 159\nof Kaas et al. (2004)) are likely powered mostly by single, shorter wavelength sources. Table\n3 lists the positions and flux densities of these four nominal point sources with short comments, since their 160\u03bcm photometry is not described in any of our other publications on\nSerpens. None of these is in the core area of either of the main clusters. This is because large\nareas in those clusters are saturated, and the close spacing of many bright sources leads to\nthe complicated, extended structure seen in Figure 2 at 160\u03bcm, without obvious point-like\nsources.\nAfter extraction, the source lists were bandmerged with our IRAC source lists for Serpens (Harvey et. al. 2006) and the 2MASS catalog of J, H, and Ks photometry (Skrutskie et al.\n2006) as described by Evans et al. (2007). The radius for source matching with shorter wavelength detections was 4\" at 24\u03bcm and 8\" at 70\u03bcm. Table 4 lists the number of sources extracted at 24 and 70\u03bcm, and some examples of statistics of numbers identified with shorter\nwavelength sources. In addition to bandmerging, sources undergo a classification process\nbased on the available photometry, 2MASS, IRAC, and MIPS. For the purposes of this\npaper the most important classification is that of \"star\" which implies a spectral energy\ndistribution that is well-fit as a reddened stellar photosphere without requiring any excess\ninfrared emission from possible circumstellar dust. The data reported here consist of a subset of all the sources extracted in Serpens. The entire catalog is available from the SSC\nwebsite (http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/all.html). For this paper we have limited our\ndiscussion to sources with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5 and to sources found in both\nepochs of observation to eliminate asteroids. These limits lead to a very high reliability for\nthe objects reported here, probably greater than 98%.\nIn addition to our reduction of the Serpens Cloud and off-cloud data, we have also\nprocessed a 5.3 deg2 portion of the SWIRE Spitzer Legacy data (Surace et al. 2004) from\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe ELAIS N1 field through our c2d pipeline. Since this field is almost entirely populated\nby Galactic stars and extragalactic objects, it provides an additional control field against\nwhich to compare our Serpens Cloud population as discussed below. Note that the SWIRE\nobservations go approximately a factor of 4 deeper than c2d due to increased integration\ntime.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nExtended Emission\n\nThe 160\u03bcm emission traces the coolest and most extended dust seen with MIPS. Figure 4\nshows an image of the 160\u03bcm emission together with contours of the optical extinction. Also\nshown are the locations of the two main clusters of young stellar objects in Serpens, the core\nCluster A, and Cluster B (also called the G3-G6 cluster by Djupvik et al. (2006)). The optical\nextinction has been estimated by our fitting of the objects that were well characterized as\nextincted stellar photospheres. This figure shows a very close correlation between the coolest\ndust and the dust that is associated with optical extinction. The figure also clearly shows\nthat the two high-stellar-density clusters, Cluster A and B, are located in areas of maximum\nextinction, as we discuss further in \u00a73.5.\n\n3.2.\n\n24\u03bcm Time Variability\n\nSince many pre-main-sequence stars exhibit variable optical emission, we conducted a\nsimple examination of the 24\u03bcm fluxes from the two observed epochs, similar to that in\nPerseus by Rebull et al. (2007) and for the IRAC data in Serpens (Harvey et al. 2007). As\nshown in Table 1, the time difference between the two epochs of observation was of order 4\nhours. Figure 5 shows the ratio of the 24\u03bcm flux density between the two epochs for all the\nextracted sources whose signal-to-noise ratio was above 5 that were detected in both epochs\nof observation. Although there are a few outliers beyond the limits expected on the basis\nof the signal-to-noise ratios, these are all readily explained as due to poor photometry near\nthe edges of the mosaic or problems due to source confusion or adjacency to bright sources.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Rebull et al. (2007) for the Perseus 24\u03bcm sources\nand by Harvey et al. (2007) for the Serpens IRAC sources. Although there are undoubtedly\nsome variable sources in these clouds, the observing techniques of the c2d program were not\ndesigned to enable reliable detection of modestly variable objects.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.3.\n\nSource Counts\n\nBecause the Serpens star-forming cloud is so close to the Galactic plane, b \u223c 5 degrees,\nthe vast majority of the sources detected at the shorter wavelengths are background stars in\nthe Galaxy. At tfainter flux levels, background extragalactic objects constitute a significant\npopulation. In order to estimate the background Galactic star numbers we have used the\nWainscoat et al. (1992) model provided by J. Carpenter (private communication). Figure 6\nshows the predicted star counts from the model together with the observed counts at 24\u03bcm\nfor both the Serpens Cloud and the off-cloud region. Also shown in the figure are the source\ncounts from the c2d-processed SWIRE ELAIS N1 field which are largely extragalactic for\nfluxes below a few mJy. This figure shows that contamination by Galactic stars at the\nbrighter fluxes and by extragalactic sources at the faint end is a significant problem for\nidentifying Serpens Cloud members. To address this problem we discuss our use of several\ncolor and flux criteria in the following section. It is also apparent that there is an excess of\nbright (F > 300 mJy) sources relative to the expected background counts. This excess is,\nin fact, real and represents the bright end of the YSO candidate population discussed in the\nfollowing section.\n\n3.4.\n\nColor-Magnitude Diagrams\n\nThe c2d team has discussed in a number of studies how the use of color-magnitude and\ncolor-color diagrams can separate likely young cloud members with infrared excesses from\nreddened stars and many background extragalactic sources (Young et al. 2005; Harvey et. al.\n2006; Rebull et al. 2007; Harvey et al. 2007). Since nearly half of the area covered by our\nMIPS 24\u03bcm observations was not observed with IRAC (Harvey et. al. 2006), we utilize the\ncolor and magnitude criteria developed by Young et al. (2005) and refined by Rebull et al.\n(2007) and Chapman et al. (2007) to isolate a candidate YSO population without requiring\nthe existence of IRAC data. The most populated diagram is naturally the color-magnitude\ndiagram of Ks versus Ks - [24] because of the much larger number of 24\u03bcm sources than\n70\u03bcm ones. Figure 7 shows the distribution of sources in this diagram for the 1453 sources\nwith S/N above 5 at 24\u03bcm and with 2MASS Ks matches within 4\". This distribution is\nvery similar to that seen in other well-populated c2d clouds such as Perseus (Rebull et al.\n2007). A comparison of the SWIRE results, the Serpens off-cloud results, and the Serpens\nCloud data shows: 1) objects in our \"star\" class fall in a relatively narrow band with blue\nKs -[24] colors (Ks -[24] < 1) as would be expected, and 2) the part of the diagram toward\nredder colors is populated by a number of sources in Serpens that are not seen in either\nthe off-cloud region or in the SWIRE data set, except at K magnitudes fainter than Ks \u223c\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n14. This allows us to assign a high probability that sources in the region Ks < 14 and Ks\n-[24] > 2 are Serpens Cloud YSO candidates with excess emission at 24\u03bcm probably due\nto circumstellar dust. Note that the off-cloud area does have a population of moderately\nreddened objects (Ks -[24] < 2), well-fit as stellar photospheres that are not seen in the\nSWIRE sample, simply because even the off-cloud area has more reddening than the high\nGalactic latitude ELAIS N1 region. In order to categorize our YSO candidates crudely in\nterms of evolutionary state, we have drawn lines in Figure 7 indicating where objects would\nfall based on the YSO source classification criteria of Greene et al. (1994) using the Ks -[24]\ncolor to measure the spectral slope. Table 5 lists the number of candidates and the number\nin each of the four classes. Although AGB stars with substantial mass loss also exhibit midinfrared excesses, Harvey et. al. (2006) have argued that the number expected in this area is\nless than or of order a half dozen (four of which have already been confirmed spectroscopically\nas AGB interlopers by Merin et al. (in prep.). The positions of and photometry for the YSO\ncandidates that are not in the area covered by IRAC are given by Harvey et al. (2007) along\nwith those in the IRAC area.\nHarvey et al. (2007) discuss the comparison between YSO's selected by the criteria used\nhere (Ks and 24\u03bcm data only) and the more restrictive criteria possible with the combination\nof IRAC data. They basically find that we actually may have missed 8 or 9 YSO's in the area\nnot covered by IRAC and included a very few, 3 or 4, that may be background extragalactic\nsources. But the overall conclusion is that there is a good correspondence between the YSO\ncandidates found using only MIPS and 2MASS versus those selected with a more complete\ndata set. It is also clear that the area mapped by both IRAC and MIPS, 0.85 deg2 contains\na much higher density of YSO's, 235 or 276 deg\u22122 than does the area only covered by\nMIPS/24\u03bcm with 51 YSO's or 54 deg\u22122 . Even if we exclude the area of the two high density\nclusters, the area covered by the combined IRAC/MIPS observations has a YSO density a\nfactor of 4 higher than the area not included in the IRAC observations.\nWe have also plotted our photometry in two other color/magnitude spaces for comparison with other c2d clouds. Figure 8 shows the distribution of sources in Ks vs. Ks -[70]\nspace. As observed by Rebull et al. (2007) in Perseus, there are a large number of likely\ncloud members at much brighter Ks magnitudes than seen for SWIRE extragalactic objects.\nIn addition, there is a small population of faint (in Ks ) objects that are redder than any of\nthe SWIRE objects in both Serpens and Perseus. The four objects redder than Ks -[70] = 15\nare all likely to be slightly less extreme versions of the sources discussed in the next section.\nTwo of these are located in cluster A, but tend to be around the outside of the tight cluster\nof very red objects. The other two are in a small grouping associated with the second of\nthe four 160\u03bcm point sources listed in Table 3. Since all of these objects were also observed\nin our program with IRAC, they are also listed in the appropriate tables of Harvey et al.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(2007), and all are considered high probability YSO's.\nThe final color-magnitude diagram, [24] vs [24]-[70] is shown in Figure 9. Again this\ndistribution is qualitatively similar to that in Perseus, although we find many fewer sources\nin the area overlapping the red edge of the extragalactic distribution than did Rebull et al.\n(2007) for their \"rest of the cloud\". The Serpens distribution is qualitatively more similar\nto that for the NGC1333 portion of Perseus. Since many of the sources represented in this\ndiagram for Serpens are located in one of the two principal clusters, A and B, in Serpens,\nit is perhaps not surprising that they would mimic some of the properties of similar young\nclusters like NGC 1333.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Most Embedded Objects\n\nWe have selected the coldest, most obscured sources from our sample by looking for\nobjects not detected in the 2MASS survey but detected with reasonable signal-to-noise at\nboth 24 and 70\u03bcm. There are 11 such objects in our surveyed area, and these are listed in\nTable 6. Interestingly all 11 are located in the heart of either Cluster A or B. Additionally,\nas shown in Table 6 all were detected in some or all IRAC bands. Their energy distributions\nare all consistent with a designation of Class I even though they are not included in Figure\n7 since they were not detected in the 2MASS survey. In fact, several of these objects are\nstrongly enough peaked in the far-infrared that they have energy distributions consistent\nwith some nominal Class 0 sources despite the fact that all were detected with IRAC. The\nclass status of these will be discussed further using mm data by Enoch et al. (2007, in prep.).\nFigure 10 shows the SED's for the two most embedded objects from Table 6. Each of these\nappears to be associated with an outflow in its respective cluster, and both have very similar\nSED's that differ only in their absolute flux level by a factor of \u223c 10.\nTable 6 shows also that the most embedded object in Cluster B (whose SED is shown in\nFigure 10) was not selected as a YSO by Harvey et al. (2007). The reason is that the flux at\n3.6\u03bcm was too faint to meet the selection criteria of that study. The area within 15\" of that\nsource contains two other extracted compact sources in the c2d data set. The positions and\nphotometry for all three are shown in Table 7 and an image of the area is shown in Figure\n11. Although the source density is quite high, the 70\u03bcm contours shown in the figure are\nclearly centered on the northernmost source, \"C\". Source \"B\" is a slightly extended source\nthat may represent a separate exciting object or may just be the location of the most visible\njet emission that has been discussed briefly by Harvey et al. (2007) in this region. Source\n\"A\" is a faint, but very red object about 6\" to the west of source \"C\" and appears to be a\npoint-like object in the images.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nFigure 4 shows clearly that Cluster A and B are located in the highest extinction parts\nof the cloud. Therefore the lack of detection of the objects in Table 6 at 1 \u2013 2.3\u03bcm may\nbe due at least partly to the extinction of the cloud material in which they are embedded\nin addition to individual circumstellar material. Although the nominal extinction values in\nthese areas range up to Av \u223c 35 \u2013 40, the fact that these values result from smoothing\nover 90 arcseconds of the stellar distribution means that they probably underestimate the\nextinction in the most extreme regions. This association of the coldest objects with the\nhighest extinction regions is similar to the correlation seen by Enoch et al. (2007) between\nextinction and location of dense mm cores.\n\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have described the basic observational characteristics of the c2d MIPS observations\nof the Serpens Cloud. In a 1.5 deg2 area we have found 250 YSO candidates on the basis\nof the Ks -[24] color. An additional 11 objects can be identified on the basis of their 24 and\n70\u03bcm fluxes and lack of detection by 2MASS. All of these YSO candidates will be discussed\nin more detail in a companion paper (Harvey et al. 2007). All the most embedded objects are\nfound in the central area of the two main clusters of YSO's previously identified in Serpens.\nThe images and source catalogs derived from these data are all available on the SSC website,\nhttp://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/all.html.\nSupport for this work, part of the Spitzer Legacy Science Program, was provided by\nNASA through contracts 1224608, 1230782, and 1230779 issued by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407.

The\ncolor image is a composite of all three bands, and includes only the 1.27 square degree area\nwhere data are available for each of the three bands. Colors represent red:160\u03bcm green:70\n\u03bcm and blue:24\u03bcm. The black outline shows the region where 4 bands of IRAC data were\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Completeness test at 24\u03bcm. The upper solid line shows the measured completeness\nfraction for artificial sources inserted into the observed 24\u03bcm mosaic image of Serpens as a\nfunction of magnitude. The slightly higher dash-dot line shows the completeness fraction for\nsources inserted into an artificial image with no real sources but with a noise level equal to\nthat in the observed data. The lower solid line (mostly equal to zero) shows the fraction of\n\"unreliable\" sources, i.e. sources extracted which were not real.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Contours of Av at levels of 5,10,20,30 mag determined from 2MASS and Spitzer\nc2d IRAC data are overlaid on the Serpens 160 \u03bcm image.

The SWIRE counts are shown as a surface\ndensity with darker implying higher density. Objects in SWIRE are expected to be mostly\ngalaxies (objects with Ks &14) or stellar photospheres (objects with Ks \u2212 [24] .1). For the\nSerpens and off-cloud plots, filled gray circles are objects with SEDs resembling photospheres,\nand plus signs are the remaining objects. An additional box around a point denotes that it\nwas also detected at 70\u03bcm. Objects that are candidate young objects have colors unlike those\nobjects found in SWIRE, e.g., Ks .14 and Ks \u2212 [24] &1. Dashed lines denote the divisions\nbetween Class I, flat, Class II, and Class III objects; to omit foreground and background\nstars, we have further imposed a Ks \u2212 [24] >2 requirement on our Class III objects (see\ntext).\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n2\n4\n\nKs\n\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nKs-[70]\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFig. 8.- Color-magnitude diagram of Ks vs. Ks \u2212 [70] for Serpens (crosses) with data from\nthe full SWIRE survey (grey dots) included for comparison.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Color-magnitude diagram of [24] vs. [24] \u2212 [70] for Serpens (crosses) with data\nfrom the full SWIRE survey (grey dots) included for comparison.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Spectral energy distribution for the two most embedded sources in Table 6, one in\nCluster A (open squares, SSTc2dJ1829463+0115219) and one in Cluster B (open diamonds,\nSSTc2dJ18290906+0031323, source \"C\" in Table 7), both of which appear to be associated\nwith outflows.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Three color image of the eastern end of Cluster B where the most embedded\nsource, C, is located.
