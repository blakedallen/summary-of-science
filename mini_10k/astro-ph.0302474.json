The metric scales as ds2 \u2192 \u03b12 ds2 under the transformation\nr \u2192 \u03b1r and t \u2192 \u03b11\u2212n t, where n is a dimensionless measure of the strength of the\ngravitational field. The solution space forms a two-parameter family characterized by the ratios of the isothermal sound speed and the equatorial rotation speed\nto the speed of light. The isodensity surfaces are toroids, empty of matter along\nthe rotation axis. Unlike the Newtonian case, the velocity field is not constant\non a cylindrical radius because of frame dragging. As the configuration rotates\nfaster, an ergoregion develops in the form of the exterior of a cone centered about\nthe rotation axis. The sequence of solutions terminates when frame dragging becomes infinite and the ergocone closes onto the axis. The fluid velocity of the\nlast solution has a modest value in the midplane but reaches the speed of light\non the axis.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn remarkable treatments of the axisymmetric equilibria of self-gravitating, isothermal,\nunbounded, stellar and gaseous systems with flat rotation curves, Toomre (1982) and Hayashi\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\net al. (1982) found completely analytical solutions for these self-similar configurations. The\ntheory applies in the non-relativistic limit when mechanics and gravitation can be approached\nby Newtonian concepts. Written in spherical polar coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the density profile\nof a Hayashi-Toomre model has the form:\n\u0015\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0012\na2\n\u03b8\nV2\nV2\n2\n2\n(1-1)\ncsc \u03b8 sech\n1 + 2 ln cot ,\n\u03c1(r, \u03b8) = 1 + 2\n2a\n2\u03c0Gr 2\n2a\n2\nwhere V is the rotation velocity and a is the isothermal acoustic (or stellar dispersive) speed.\nNotice that, apart from a trivial scaling relative to a2 , the Hayashi-Toomre models form a\nlinear sequence characterized by the single value V 2 /a2 . Notice also that \u03c1 = 0 for \u03b8 = 0\nor \u03c0, whereas \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e as r \u2192 0 and the enclosed mass within a sphere of radius r goes\nto infinity as r \u2192 \u221e. These properties account for our assignment of the name \"singular\nisothermal toroid\" (SIT) for this generic class of models (see also Li & Shu 1996).\nWhat is the relativistic generalization of the Hayashi-Toomre sequence when a and V are\nnot small compared to the speed of light c? In this paper we confirm the intuitive expectation\nthat the linear sequence will broaden into a two-dimensional surface characterized by the\npair of dimensionless parameters v \u2261 V /c and \u03b3 \u2261 a2 /c2 . In the limit v 2 /\u03b3 \u2261 V 2 /a2 \u226b 1, we\nfurther anticipate that relativistic SITs will become highly flattened, like their non-relativistic\nanalogs in the same limit; i.e., SITs will become SIDs (singular isothermal disks).1\nRelativistic SIDs have been studied by Cai & Shu (2002, hereafter CS), who took their\ninspiration from the cold-disk work of Lynden-Bell & Pineault (1978a,b). CS adopted the\nsimplification of negligible disk thickness by assuming an anisotropic pressure tensor, with\nzero and nonzero effective sound speeds in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively.\nPart of the rationale for the present investigation is to ascertain the range of validity of the\ndisk approximation when the same effective sound speed a applies in all three principalaxis directions, and when the combination v 2 /\u03b3 is not necessarily large compared to unity.\nIn particular, we wish to examine how frame-dragging may distort expectations of toroid\nflatness formed by naive extrapolations from the Newtonian experience.\nThe astronomical motivation for the work of Hayashi et al. (1982) and Toomre (1982)\ncomes from interstellar gas clouds and disk galaxies. It is unknown whether such objects\nhave their relativistic counterparts in astrophysics. For example, active galactic nuclei and\nquasi-stellar objects are increasingly believed to be powered by supermassive blackholes\n1\n\nIn this paper, we use the terminology \"isothermal\" somewhat loosely to mean that the pressure is\ndirectly proportional to mass density \u03c1, with a constant of proportionality that we call a2 \u2261 \u03b3c2 . Such a\nproportionality can arise, of course, in physical systems in a wider context than when the thermodynamic\ntemperature is a strict constant.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(SMBHs). Are such SMBHs the central products of slow growth through an accretion disk?\nOr do they result from successive mergers of smaller units (stars or smaller BHs) in the\nnuclei of galaxies? Or could SMBHs have formed from the monolithic gravitational collapse\nof relativistically compact gaseous or stellar systems that resemble SITs?\nHaehnelt & Kauffmann (2001) discuss the difficulties associated with the first two scenarios. If the last scenario is a viable or even likely possibility, it would be important to develop\ntheoretical predictions and observational tests. Such tests provide another motivation for\nthe present line of research. In particular, it is known that slowly rotating, non-relativistic,\ngaseous SITs are unstable to inside-out gravitational collapse to form a steadily growing\npointlike mass at the center (see, e.g., Shu 1977 for the simplest case of the collapse of a\nsingular isothermal sphere or SIS). The analogous collapse of a suitably flattened, relativistic\nSIT (during the earliest epochs of galaxy formation) to form a steadily growing SMBH (with\na Kerr-like geometry) should be accompanied by the copious generation of gravitational\nradiation. Such radiation might be detectable by future gravitational-wave observatories.\nDifferentially rotating objects exemplified by SITs and SIDs have other advantages over\nthe uniformly rotating, relativistic disks investigated in the pioneering work of Bardeen &\nWagoner (1971). From numerous studies of self-gravitating systems in the Newtonian regime\n(see, e.g., Toomre 1977, Binney & Tremaine 1978, Lowe et al. 1994, Bertin et al. 1989ab,\nGoodman & Evans 1999, Shu et al. 2000), it is known that the transfer of angular momentum from inside to outside through spiral and barlike density waves is a natural phenomenon\nin configurations that are differentially rather than uniformly rotating. Moreover, for similar distributions of specific angular momentum, differentially rotating systems have lower\nspecific energy, making them more likely states to be encountered in many natural settings\n(Mestel 1963). These considerations add yet more motivation for the continued theoretical\ninvestigation of relativistic SITs and SIDs.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we develop the mathematical\nequations governing SITs. In \u00a73.1, we solve the Einstein equations in the Newtonian limit and\nshow that the solution thus obtained is identical to those of Toomre (1982) and Hayashi et al.\n(1982). In \u00a73.2 we derive analytical solutions for relativistic SISs when spherical symmetry\nholds. \u00a74 describes the numerical strategy we use to solve the fully nonlinear Einstein\nequations in the presence of finite rotation. \u00a75 summarizes the results of our calculations,\nincluding the three dimensional velocity field and the degree of flattening due to rotation.\nFinally, we offer conclusions and commentary in \u00a76.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nBasic Equations\n2.1.\n\nMetric\n\nUnlike the razor-thin disks studied in CS, we wish to consider pressure tensors in this\npaper that are isotropic in three dimensions. In spacetime, the stress-energy tensor is then a\nsmooth function of polar angle \u03b8, being positive-definite from pole to equator, with reflection\nsymmetry about the latter. Because the sources of gravity are smoother than a delta function,\nthe functions, N(\u03b8), P (\u03b8), Q(\u03b8), and Z(\u03b8) in the the metric adopted by CS,\nds2 = \u2212r 2n eN dt2 + r 2 e2P \u2212N (d\u03c6 \u2212 r n\u22121 eN \u2212P Qdt)2 + eZ\u2212N (dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 ),\n\n(2-1)\n\nhave no kinks as we cross the midplane, unlike the disk case. For clarity, we recapitulate a\nfew important properties of this metric.\nIn the above equation n is a number between 0 and 1, which we call the gravitational\nindex. In our choice of coordinates (but not in Lynden-Bell & Pineault 1978a,b), the radial\ncoordinate r has the usual dimensions of length. The presence of the extra factor r n in front\nof each power of dt would then seem to indicate that t does not have the unit of length\n(in geometric units where c = G = 1). This impression is mistaken. As explained in CS,\nthe gravitational potential of self-similar SISs, SIDs, or SITs have logarithmic dependences\non the radial coordinate r. For example, except for slight notational modifications, Toomre\n(1982) and Hayashi et al. (1982) found that the gravitational potential associated with the\ndensity distribution (1-1) is given in conventional units by\n1\n\u03a6 = (V 2 + 2a2 ) ln r + c2 N(\u03b8),\n2\nwhere N(\u03b8), up to an additive constant, has a functional form that can be obtained by\nintegration of the expression for N \u2032 to be given in \u00a73.1. When exponentiated, as in gtt =\n2\n\u2212e2\u03a6/c = \u2212r 2n eN with n = v 2 + 2\u03b3, this logarithmic dependence yields one troublesome\nfactor of r n for each index of t involved in a metric coefficient associated with the differential\nof time. However, an arbitrary length scale L introduced to make the argument of the logarithmic term formally dimensionless, i.e., to convert ln r to ln(r/L) would add an arbitrary\nconstant to the potential \u03a6 that would have no physical conseqences. The factors of r n or\nr 2n then become the dimensionless combinations (r/L)n or (r/L)2n , which would restore to\ntime t its usual unit. The arbitrariness of L then merely reflects the freedom to scale in a\nproblem that is self-similar and lacks intrinsic length scales. For notational compactness,\nwe have adopted the convention of setting L equal to unity. In any contour-level figure,\ntherefore, the reader can make whatever length assignment she or he might like to any given\ncontour, and scale all other contours accordingly. (Except for size, they all look the same.)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe coordinate \u03b8 differs from the normal definition of colatitude by a constant factor\nk \u2265 1 (see again the discussion of CS). If \u03b8 were defined as usual to have a range from 0 to\n\u03c0 (as in Lynden-Bell & Pineault 1978a,b), k would appear elsewhere in the problem as an\neigenvalue to be found by satisfying certain boundary conditions. Such eigenvalue searches\nin nonlinear differential equations are numerically very expensive. By absorbing the factor k\ninto the definition of \u03b8, we change the nature of the eigenvalue search to placing the midplane\nin a proper location \u03b80 6= \u03c0/2. Determining the value of \u03b80 turns out to be possible via a\ncomputationally non-taxing shooting scheme in our formulation of the numerical solution of\nthe Einstein equations.\nPhysically, the point is as follows. The gravitation of a flattened distribution of matter\ncurves space in such a way as to warp the polar angle \u03b8 if we choose e[Z(\u03b8)\u2212N (\u03b8)]/2 r to be\nthe radial distance from the origin along any path of constant t, \u03c6 and \u03b8. (The assumption\nof axial symmetry allows us to preserve the usual meaning of the azimuthal angle \u03c6.) This\nwarping is such as to make the total angle coverage from north rotational pole to south\nrotational pole greater than \u03c0 (but always less than 2\u03c0).\nApart from the transformations described above, the metric (2-1) has the only form\nconsistent with the requirements of self-similarity, i.e., it satisfies the scaling law ds2 \u2192 \u03b12 ds2\nwhen r \u2192 \u03b1r, and t \u2192 \u03b11\u2212n t for a constant \u03b1. As explained in CS, the scaling of t arises\nfrom the gravitational redshift associated with climbing out of the potential of this problem.\nLimiting the effect to redshifts then imposes the allowable range 0 \u2264 n \u2264 1, as we noted\nearlier and as will be confirmed in detail later.\n\n2.2.\n\nEinstein's Equations\n\nWe denote ordinary differentiation by \u03b8 with a subscript in this variable, and define\nR(a)(b) \u2261 r 2 eZ\u2212N R(a)(b) , where R(a)(b) is the usual Ricci tensor.

In the problem of an\ninfinitesimally thin disk, both equations are evaluated on the equatorial plane only. If we\nthen impose symmetry about the equator, the second equation is identically satisfied upon\nintegrating across the mid-plane.

This set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is supplemented by a set of constraint equations from the rest of Einstein equations and equations of\nmotion involving only first- and zeroth-order derivatives, respectively, of metric and matter\nvariables:\n1 \u2212 v2\n+ Qv(1 \u2212 n),\n0 = \u2212n + v 2 + 2\u03b3\n1+\u03b3\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00132\n2n\n2\n\u2032 1\u2212n\n\u20322\n2 1\u2212n\n\u2032 \u2032 4n\n4\u03b3 \u03b5\u0302 =\n+ F + 2F P Q\n\u2212N \u2212Q\n+P N\n.\n1+n\n1+n\n1+n\n1+n\n\n(2-12a)\n(2-12b)\n\nNotice that Z decouples from the other three metric coefficients. Its dynamical ODE\ncan be replaced by one of the equations of motion associated with the contracted Bianchi\nidentity. The function Z can be easily obtained through integration once the other three\nmetric coefficients N, P , and Q are found.\nEquation (2-12a) for radial force balance has the following important implication: v\ncannot be a constant, as in the nonrelativistic case, but must vary with \u0398 if the coefficient\ngoverning frame dragging Q does. Moreover, because Q(\u0398) must vanish on the rotational\npoles, \u0398 = 0 and 2\u03980 , v will generally not be zero at the rotation axis for general n and\n\u03b3 (e.g., V 6= 0 for general Hayashi-Toomre SITs). Indeed, because (1 \u2212 n) and Q are both\npositive, v will achieve its greatest value on the rotational pole, where frame dragging cannot\nhelp centrifugal forces and pressure gradients to balance self-similar gravity.\nAs a final comment, notice that although equation (2-12b) can be used to compute\nenergy density \u03b5\u0302 on computational grid points, it does not manifestly require a positive\ndefinite value for \u03b5\u0302. Fortunately, we know that the other non-trivial contracted Bianchi\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nidentity guarantees that equation (2-12b) is a redundant relationship, given the remaining\nindependent equations of the governing set. Thus, we can use equaton (2-11d) to integrate\nfor ln \u03b5\u0302 (always obtaining a positive value \u03b5\u0302 no matter what the sign of ln \u03b5\u0302), and then check\nnumerically that equation (2-12b) yields a consistent result (which it always does). Thus,\nthe remaining equations (2-11) and (2-12a) form a complete set to determine the spacetime\ngeometry.\n\n2.3.\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\nThe equations (2-11) form a set of first-order non-linear ODEs in the five variables\n{N , Q, Q\u2032 , P \u2032, ln \u03b5\u0302}. Thus, five boundary conditions will specify a solution. As explained\nbelow, we have three boundary conditions each that we desire to impose at the pole and the\nequator, and therefore we seemingly have an overdetermined situation. In fact, because the\nlocation of the equator is not given a priori, we have a well-posed problem.\n\u2032\n\nLet us start with the rotation axis. As usual, one wants a circle in the \u03c6 direction\nspecified by constant \u0398 to have vanishingly small circumference if \u0398 \u2192 0. Thus, we need\neP \u2192 0, which requires P to go to \u2212\u221e at the pole \u0398 = 0. In order to have a non-singular\ngeometry on the axis, the Ricci tensor must remain finite as \u0398 \u2192 0. The boundary conditions\non the axis that are compatible with the Newtonian limit are therefore\nN\u2032 = 0 :\nQ=0:\n\u2032\n\nP = +\u221e :\n\nThe gravitational field is smooth across the axis.\nThere is no frame dragging on the axis.\n\n(2-13)\n\nCoordinate singularity.\n\nWe noted earlier that the fluid velocity v is generally non-vanishing on the rotation axis\n(as is true, e.g., in the Hayashi-Toomre models). We anticipate therefore that the infinite\n\"centrifugal\" effect at the pole will drive away all matter from it and create a cavity there\n(explaining, e.g., why the Hayashi-Toomre configurations are \"toroids\"). If we suppose that\na near-vacuum situation applies also to relativistic SITs and approximate \u03b5\u0302 to be vanishingly\nsmall near the rotation axis, we can show that equation (2-11d) has the general solution,\nP = ln[K sin(\u0398 \u2212 \u03981 )],\n\n(2-14)\n\nin a small neighborhood of \u0398 = \u03981 where \u03b5\u0302 vanishes, with K and \u03981 being integration\nconstants. The coordinate singularity imposed by P \u2032 being infinite on the north pole then\nidentifies that \u03981 = 0; i.e., P \u2032 \u2248 1/\u0398 for small \u0398. Notice finally that the divergence of\nP \u2032 at the north pole is consistent with the vanishing there of the energy density \u03b5\u0302 on the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nleft-hand side of equation (2-11d). Thus, from a physical point of view, we can now see that\nthe boundary conditions Q = 0 and P \u2032 = +\u221e at the axis are not two distinct requirements,\nbut only one (once we fix the north pole to be at \u0398 = 0).\nWe recapitulate. The condition Q = 0 at the pole makes v generally nonzero on the\naxis. A non-vanishing v on the rotation axis centrifugally expels matter from the region\n\u0398 = 0. This makes \u03b5\u0302 zero, leading to a logarithmic divergence of P (\u0398) at \u0398 = 0 that allows\nthe automatic satisfaction of P \u2032 = +\u221e at the north pole, once we have located it properly\nrelative to the equator. The latter can be assured by a proper technique to determine \u03980\n(see below).\nNext, we demand the solution to be symmetric about the midplane. This implies that\nthe first derivatives of metric coefficients have to vanish there. Thus, at the midplane,\nN \u2032 = P \u2032 = Q\u2032 = 0.\n\n(2-15)\n\nNotice from equation (2-11d) that \u03b5\u0302\u2032 vanishes automatically once the other three conditions\nare met. Equations (2-13) and (2-15) are the six boundary conditions referred to at the\nbeginning of this subsection.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nSpecial Solutions\nNewtonian Limit\n\nBefore we describe the numerical procedure and general solution, let us pause to discuss\nthe Newtonian limit, where v and \u03b3 are small compared to unity. This limit should yield\nToomre and Hayashi's result. In the Newtonian limit, gij approaches the metric of Euclidean\nspace in spherical coordinates; g0i vanishes; and g00 \u2192 \u2212 exp(2\u03a6) \u223c \u22121 + O(v 2). In our\nmetric, this procedure translates to\n\u03c0\n\u03b3, v 2 , \u03b5\u0302, N = O(n) \u226a 1,\n\u0398 = \u03b8,\n\u03980 = ,\nP = ln sin \u03b8,\nQ = Z = 0.\n2\nWith these simplifications, Einstein's field equations reduce to the usual Poisson's relation,\nand the equations of motion recover those of Newtonian fluid dynamics. Instead of (2-11d),\nwe will revert to using (2-12b) to determine the energy density. Equations (2-12a), (2-12b),\nand (2-11a) now have the approximate forms:\n0 = \u2212n + v 2 + 2\u03b3\n\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u0302 = n2 + n cot \u03b8N \u2032 \u2212 N \u2032 ,\n4\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nN = \u03b5\u0302 \u2212 N cot \u03b8 \u2212 2n.\n\n(3-1)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThese equations may be combined to give a single nonlinear first-order ODE for N \u2032 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\n1\nn2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\nN =\n\u2212 1 N \u2032 cot \u03b8 \u2212 N \u2032 +\n\u2212 2n,\n\u03b3\n4\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(3-2)\n\nto be solved subject to the boundary condition N \u2032 = 0 for \u03b8 = 0.

The second and third equations give,\nrespectively, the density distribution (proportional to \u03b5\u0302) and the self-consistent gravitational\nfield (proportional to N \u2032 ) required to achieve mechanical equilibrium in the \u03b8 direction.\nApart from notational differences, these results are indeed what Toomre and Hayashi found.\nFor the nonrotating configuration, we expect a spherically symmetric solution. In this\nlimit, n = 2\u03b3, and\n\u03b5\u0302 = 4\u03b3,\nN \u2032 = 0.\nExpressed in dimensional variables, this is the familiar result, \u03c1 = \u03b5/c2 = a2 /2\u03c0Gr 2, appropriate for a SIS.\nWhen there is even a slight amount of rotation, n > 2\u03b3, and \u03b5\u0302 \u2192 0 on the axis. In fact,\nfor \u03b8 \u226a 1,\n2\n\u03b5\u0302 \u221d \u03b8n/\u03b3\u22122 \u221d \u03b8v /\u03b3 ,\n\nand curves of constant density \u03c1 \u221d \u03b5\u0302(\u03b8)/r 2 follow\nr \u221d \u03b8v\n\n2 /2\u03b3\n\n.\n\n(3-4)\n\nThus, except for a very narrow range of angles in the meridional plane near the pole, where\nisodensity contours plunge toward the origin, isodensity contours otherwise look nearly circular, r \u2248 constant, when v 2 /2\u03b3 \u226a 1. As v 2 /2\u03b3 increases because of a greater importance of\nrotational compared to pressure support, isodensity contours become more flattened toward\nthe equatorial plane. Indeed, the figures in Toomre (1982) and Hayashi et al. (1982) show\nthat the solutions rapidly approach a disk-like solution as one increases the level of rotation\nto v 2 /2\u03b3 \u226b 1. We expect the same qualitative behavior to extend into the fully relativistic\nregime.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nRelativistic SISs\n\nIn the absence of rotation, the general relativistic solution is a spherically symmetric\none with Q = 0 and v = 0.

In fact, N \u2032 has to be 0 if we are to satisfy\nthe boundary conditions (2-13) and (2-15). With N \u2032 , Q, and v all zero, the equation for\nZ \u2032 shows that it is also 0. Without loss of generality, we may then choose the constants\nN and Z themselves to be 0, so that the metric (2-1) involves no extra scale factors in an\ninterpretation of r as the radial distance from the origin along any path of constant (t, \u03b8, \u03c6).\nThus, the only nontrivial metric coefficient is P , which satisfies the ODE (2-11c):\n2\n\nP \u2032\u2032 + P \u2032 = \u2212\u03b12 ,\n\n(3-6)\n\nwhere the positive constant \u03b1 \u2264 1 is defined as\np\n\u03b1 \u2261 1 \u2212 2\u03b5\u0302\u03b3 =\n\np\n1 + 6\u03b3 + \u03b3 2\n.\n1 + 3\u03b3\n\n(3-7)\n\nEquation (3-6) may be put into the form\neP\n\n\u0001\u2032\u2032\n\n= \u2212\u03b12 eP ,\n\n(3-8)\n\nand may be integrated, subject to the pole boundary condition eP = 0 at \u0398 = 0, to yield\neP = A sin(\u03b1\u0398),\n\n(3-9)\n\nwith A a nonzero constant.\nWhen we apply the equatorial boundary condition, P \u2032 = 0 at \u0398 = \u03980 , we obtain the\nidentification cos \u03b1\u03980 = 0, or\n\u03c0\n\u03980 =\n.\n(3-10)\n2\u03b1\nThe only remaining task is to determine the value of the constant A. We accomplish this\ntask by requiring that, in the presence of spherical symmetry, half the circumference of a\ngreat circle in the meriodional plane, 2r\u03b80 = 2r\u03980 /(1+n) according to the metric (2-1), must\nbe equal to half the circumference of a great circle in the equatorial plane, \u03c0reP (\u03980 ) = A\u03c0r.\nThis equality generates the identification,\nA=\n\n1\n1+\u03b3\n\u2264 1.\n=p\n\u03b1(1 + n)\n1 + 6\u03b3 + \u03b3 2\n\n(3-11)\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nThus, the ratio of the circumference of a great circle 2A\u03c0r to its radius r from the origin is\nless than 2\u03c0 for a relativistic SIS with \u03b3 > 0. This is a familar result known for relativistic,\nself-gravitating, pressure-supported (and therefore spherically symmetric) equilibria, but it\nis usually derived for Schwarzschild (or Oppenheimer-Volkoff) coordinates, where 2\u03c0rS is\ndefined as the circumference of a great circle, and rS is not the true radial distance from\nthe origin. What appears as distortions of angles in our metric (e.g., \u03b80 \u2265 \u03c0/2 is the\n\"angle\" between pole and equator) transforms as distortions of the radial dimension in the\nSchwarzschild metric. If we were to adopt the Schwarzshild description for angles, the radial\ndistance r to the origin would turn out to be a power law of rS , with an exponent different\nfrom unity.\nAs a check that our definitions of \u03b8 and \u03c6 lead to no true distortions of angular relationships in the spherically symmetric case, we note that the surface area of a sphere can be\ncalculated from the metric (2-1) as\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ \u03b80\nZ\n4\u03c0r 2 \u03980\n4\u03c0r 2\n2\nP\n2r\nd\u03c6\ne d\u03b8 =\nA sin(\u03b1\u0398) d\u0398 = 2\n.\n(3-12)\n1+n 0\n\u03b1 (1 + n)2\n0\n0\n\nIf we compare this formula to the circumference of a great circle 2\u03c0r/\u03b1(1 + n), we note that\nthe ratio of the surface area of a sphere to the square of the circumference of a great circle on\nthe surface of that sphere equals 1/\u03c0, the same relation as for Euclidean geometry (QED).\nAngles (polar and azimuthal) maintain their usual relations; it is only the radial direction\nthat suffers true distortion in a relativistic SIS. This completes our discussion of SITs with\nanalytically soluble forms.\n\n4.\n\nNumerical Solution\n\nFrom dimensional considerations, the solutions for rotating SITs form a two-parameter\nfamily. The equation of state is a result of microscopic physics, which is independent of the\nmacroscopic spacetime geometry. Thus, the square of the isothermal sound speed, \u03b3, is a\nnatural choice for one of the parameters. The other convenient constant of the problem, n,\nmeasures the strength of the gravitational field. Ideally, we might have preferred to specify\nin advance the amount of rotation. However, this is inconvenient as v is a function of \"polar\nangle\" \u0398. We therefore fix on \u03b3 and n to parameterize our solutions, and let this combination\ndetermine implicitly the amount of rotation on the equator and elsewhere.\nTo implement a practical numerical scheme, we solve equation (2-12a) as a quadratic\nrelation for v to obtain\np\n\u2212Q(1 + \u03b3)(1 \u2212 n) + (1 + \u03b3)2 (1 \u2212 n)2 Q2 + 4(1 \u2212 \u03b3)(n + n\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b3)\nv=\n.\n(4-1)\n2(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nUsing the above relation, we compute v(\u0398) from Q(\u0398) at every step for use in equations\n(2-11). Causality demands v < 1 and \u03b3 < 1, and Q must have the same sign as v, which is\ntaken to be positive by convention. Thus, the solution space is constrained to satisfy\n2\u03b3\n\u2264 n \u2264 1.\n1+\u03b3\n\n0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1,\n\n(4-2)\n\nIn fact, (1 + \u03b3)/(1 \u2212 \u03b3) times n \u2212 2\u03b3/(1 + \u03b3) is the value of v 2 at the pole.\nFor convenience, we start at the midplane. Because the governing ODEs, equations\n(2-11) and (2-12), contain no coefficients that depend explicitly on \u0398 itself, these equations\nare formally invariant to an overall translation of the value of \u0398 at the midplane. Thus, a\nsimple transformation of variables from \u0398 to \u03a8 \u2261 \u0398 \u2212 \u03980 means that we do not need to\nguess a value of \u03980 at the equator, but can obtain it afterwards when we reach the pole, as\ndefined by the value of \u2212\u03a8 where Q = 0 is reached. Attainment of Q = 0 at the pole leads\nto the automatic satisfaction there of P \u2032 = +\u221e as we discussed earlier.\nThe boundary conditions (2-15) define the corresponding values of N \u2032 , P \u2032, and Q\u2032 at\nthe new midplane label \u03a8 = 0. In principle, we need to guess midplane values of Q and \u03b5\u0302 to\nbegin the integration toward the north pole. In practice, we can eliminate the need to guess\n\u03b5\u0302 at the equator, and use equation (2-12b) to obtain this value, given \u03b3 and n. Thus, we are\nleft with a one-dimensional shooting task of adjusting a guessed midplane value of Q = q to\nsatisfy the boundary condition N \u2032 = 0 at the pole \u03a8 = \u2212\u03980 . Since we want the local energy\ndensity to be positive in equation (2-12b), a useful value of q must reside within the interval:\n0\u2264q\u2264\n\n2n\n.\n1\u2212n\n\n(4-3)\n\nA slight difficulty enters to complicate the above program that deserves mention. When\nregarded as a function of q, the relevant zero of N \u2032 (0) turns out to be a double root; i.e.,\n\u2202N \u2032 (\u0398 = 0)/\u2202q = 0 at the sought-after value of q. We therefore numerically compute\n\u2202N \u2032 (\u0398 = 0)/\u2202q and refine the grid of possible q values when this quantity becomes small,\nso as not inadvertently to jump over the root of N \u2032 (\u0398 = 0).\n\n5.\n\nResults\n\nTo make meridional cross-sectional plots of isodensity surfaces, we use \"cylindrical\" coordinates (t, \u031f, \u03c6, z) that are the counterparts of the system used by Lynden-Bell & Pineault\n(1978a,b):\n\u031f = r 1/k sin(\u03b8/k),\nz = r 1/k cos(\u03b8/k),\n(5-1)\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nwhere\n\n2\n\u03b80\n\u03c0\nis the factor \u2265 1 for the models of this paper discussed in \u00a72.\nk\u2261\n\n(5-2)\n\nIn these coordinates the metric reads\nds2 = \u2212(\u031f 2 + z 2 )kn eN dt2 + (\u031f 2 + z 2 )k e2P \u2212N [d\u03c6 \u2212 (\u031f 2 + z 2 )k(n\u22121)/2 eN \u2212P Qdt]2\n+ k 2 (\u031f 2 + z 2 )k\u22121 eZ\u2212N (d\u031f 2 + dz 2 ),\n\n(5-3)\n\nwith the \u03b8 dependences of the metric coefficients N(\u03b8), P (\u03b8), Q(\u03b8), Z(\u03b8) now to be interpreted by making the substitution\n\u03b8 = k arctan(\u031f/z).\n\n(5-4)\n\nBecause of spatial curvature, faithful representations of both lengths and angles (in\nthe meridional plane) would require curved sheets of paper or a 3-D embedding diagram.\nConventional publishing limitations restrict our ability to do full justice to such possible\ngraphical representations, and we have compromised by making (\u031f, z) plots of the isodensity\ncontours using the coordinate definitions (5-1). We emphasize, however, that when n is not\nsmall (i.e., when gravity is not weak), such plots give graphical relationships of isodensity\ncontours for the coordinate labels only, and do not accurately represent spatial separations\nor angles. Figure 1 gives such plots for the case \u03b3 = 1/3 (e.g., an ultrarelativistic ideal gas\nwhether \"isothermal\" or not) when n ranges from a minimum value n = 1/2, corresponding\nto no rotation (i.e., a SIS), to a value close to the maximum value n = 1, corresponding to\nthe most rapidly rotating SIT possible.\nWhen we introduce rotation, \u03b5\u0302 has to vanish on the axis as a result of the centrifugal\nemptying process described earlier. Near the pole, we assume \u03b5\u0302 \u221d \u0398\u03bb for \u03bb > 0, and adopt\na series expansion for P \u2032, using the \"dynamical\" equations (2-11):\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\u0012\n1\n1+\u03b3\nn + n\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b3\n1+\u03b3\nv\n\u2032\nP = + O(\u0398),\n=\n\u03bb=\n=\n(n \u2212 nmin ),\n2\n\u0398\n\u03b3\n1\u2212v\n\u03b3(1 \u2212 n)\n\u03b3(1 \u2212 n)\nwhere we have used equation (2-12a) on the axis. Notice that in our constrained solution\nspace (4-2), \u03bb \u2265 0. For a slight rotation, \u03bb \u226a 1, the power-law behavior of the energy density\nnear the axis causes it to change at a normalized radius from 1 to 0 nearly discontinuously\nas the pole is approached. This behavior is depicted in Figure 2. Expressed differently,\nthe parameter \u03bb controls the slope of isodensity contours near the pole. As \u03bb \u2192 0+ , the\nisodensity curve in the meridional plane switches from being horizontal to being vertical very\nquickly as the curve approaches the origin (see Fig. 1). Although \u03b5\u0302 has to vanish formally\non the axis, Figure 1 shows isodensity contours essentially to be spherical when \u03bb is small.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nIn general, for positive values of \u03b3 < 1, \u03bb ranges from 0 for the minimum allowed\ngravitational index n (and no rotation) to \u221e for n = 1, which is the maximum gravitational\nfield strength allowed by causality. When \u03b3 = 1, a limiting process is required. If we take\nthe limit \u03b3 \u2192 1 first, then we are forced to take n = 1, and we recover the nonrotating\nsolution of a self-similar sphere with \u03bb = 0. However, if we fix n = 1 and let \u03b3 \u2192 1, then\nthe result is a maximally rotating SIT with \u03bb = \u221e. This ambiguity is a manifestation of\nthe sphere-toroid transition at zero rotational velocity discussed earlier.\nFrom a purely mathematical point of view, the double-limit ambiguity arises because of\nthe non-uniform convergence of solutions towards the singular point n = \u03b3 = 1. After all,\nthe Einstein equations formally allow solutions with n > 1. However, these spacetimes are\nacausal and have divergent energy density on the axis, and thus are irrelevant for physical\nconsiderations. We shall not digress further on this issue. In the following analysis, it is\nunderstood that we always take \u03b3 \u2192 1 first.\n5.1.\n\nVelocity Field\n\nWith the three-dimensional solutions, we have a chance to study the velocity field as a\nfunction of polar angle. In a disk of infinitesimal thickness, for each value of \u03b3, the rotation\nspeed in the plane of the disk is limited to a maximum value that arises when the frame\ndragging becomes infinite: Q \u2192 \u221e accompanied by n \u2192 1. Empirically, CS (see their Table\n1) found the maximum rotational velocity for a disk to be a function of \u03b3 given approximately\nby\n1\nvc =\n.\n(5-5)\n2.294 + 1.091\u03b3\nThe fact that the maximum velocity any disk can have is only about 43.8% of the speed of\nlight came as a surprise when Lynden-Bell & Pineault (1978b) first discovered it for a cold\ndisk, and it has remained a mystery until now.\nThree-dimensional SITs are more realistic systems than completely flattened SIDs (with\ntheir infinitesimal thickness resulting from an artificial imposition of a highly anisotropic\npressure tensor). In a SIT, as seen in Fig 3, the velocity field increases towards the axis,\nreaching a significant fraction of the speed of light in most cases. This qualitative result was\nanticipated by our previous discussion. The maximum of the velocity field occurs on the\naxis where Q = 0 and is given by equation (4-1) as\n2\nvaxis\n=\n\nn + n\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b3\n.\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\nFor a fixed value of \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1), vaxis increases from 0 for minimum rotation to 1 (the speed\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nof light) for the ultrarelativistic limit. The sequence is then terminated while the equatorial\nvelocities are still a minor fraction of the speed of light, comparable, in fact to the subluminal\nvalues given by equation (5-5) for the pure-disk solutions. (For more precise comparisons,\nsee below.) The naive expectation that relativity sets limitations on physical systems only\nbecause matter acquires velocities approaching the speed of light is indeed met for SITs\nwhere models terminate when (vanishingly small amounts of) gas near the pole become\nultra-relativistic. It is only SIDs that present an apparent puzzle because the assumption of\na vacuum above and below the exact midplane of the disk removed all material tracers of\nthis ultra-relativistic motion a priori!\nThe restriction of equatorial rotation velocities to modest fractions of the speed of\nlight implies that differentially rotating, gaseous configurations with isotropic pressure contributing a significant fraction of the total support against self-gravity, cannot be too highly\nflattened. Despite this caveat, however, it is remarkable how useful the approximation of a\ndisk-like geometry can be to predict certain physical characteristics of more realistic systems.\nIn Table 1, we tabulate as a function of \u03b3 the maximum equatorial velocity vc attainable by\na SID or SIT when the gravitational field acquires the maximum index n = 1 (reached by\nextrapolation from values of n somewhat smaller than unity). From this tabulation, we see\nthat the two values of vc are in very good agreement when \u03b3 \u226a 1. This is a natural result\nbecause the critically rotating SIT is extremely flattened at low levels of pressure support.\nHowever, the good agreement persists to relativistic values of \u03b3 \u2248 0.5, a surprise since vc2 /\u03b3\nis far from being large compared to unity, as is required formally for the disk approximation\nto hold. Indeed, complete breakdown of the disk approximation does not occur in the Table\nuntil vc2 /\u03b3 is significantly smaller than unity. Recalling that the ratio of pressure to energy\ndensity (including rest mass) is given by \u03b3 = 1/3 for ultrarelativistic ideal gases, we see that\nTable 1 implies excellent agreement in the gross properties of SITs and SIDs with realistic\nequations of state which are maximally rotating. (The apparent discrepancy at \u03b3 = 0 arises\nfrom an imperfect extrapolation of SITs to this limit.) This finding relieves some of the worries that one might otherwise have about the applicability of results derived from a flat disk\nanalysis when parameters are used that would give such disks appreciable vertical thickness\nif the pressure were isotropic rather than anisotropic (see the caveats expressed in CS).\n\n6.\n\nConclusion and Commentary\n\nWith the aid of self-similarity, we have constructed a two parameter family of semianalytic solutions to the Einstein field equations, parameterized by the gravitational index\nand an isotropic pressure. The isodensity surfaces are toroids, qualitatively similar to their\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nNewtonian counterparts (Toomre 1982, Hayashi et al. 1982).\nThe main difference between relativistic SITs and their non-relativistic counterparts\nis that the former do not satisfy, even approximately, the Poincar\u00e9-Wavr\u00e9 theorem (see,\ne.g., Tassoul 1978). In the Newtonian limit, Goldreich & Schubert (1967) have shown that\nequilibria which violate the constraint of isorotation on cylinders are unstable on timescales\nthat range from dynamical to secular. It is not known whether such instabilities persist\ninto the relativistic regime if the cause of the departures from isorotation on cylinders is the\ndragging of inertial frames. This issue deserves further investigation.\nWe have also gained insight into how frame dragging figures prominently into another\npuzzle. Lynden-Bell & Pineault (1978b) found, and CS confirmed, that the rotational velocities of completely flat, relativistic disks are limited to be less than 0.438 times the speed\nof light. This limitation appears quite peculiar, but when we examine the behavior of threedimensional toroids, the velocity field turns out, as summarized above, to be a function of\nthe polar angle. While the equator is still rotating modestly (subluminally), the velocity on\nthe axis can reach the speed of light when an appropriate combination of parameters holds.\nAs a result, matter is pushed away from the axis much more strongly than one might have\nsuspected by examining only the ratio of rotational support v 2 on the midplane to the pressure contribution \u03b3. As a byproduct, a disklike approximation still holds for many SITs to\na surprisingly good degree when one might otherwise have expected a complete breakdown\nof such a simplified description.\nThe direct applicability of relativistic SITs and SIDs to realistic astrophysical systems\nis questionable. They have inner and outer singularities (infinite central density, divergent\nenclosed mass at infinity) that lead to spacetime geometries (quasi-naked singularity at the\norigin, nonflat spacetime asymptotically) which are conventionally rejected as inapt descriptions of reality. However, we note that the issue of the possibility of naked singularities in the\nuniverse has not been settled in any definitive form (Penrose 1998), and non-asymptotically\nflat spacetimes are a common feature of many standard cosmologies, including the currently\nfavored versions of accelerating universes with positive cosmological constants. Moreover,\nfor a problem to be interesting in general relativity, spacetime has to possess curvature.\nBut self-similar spacetimes that have power law dependences on some radial coordinate are\nguaranteed to run into trouble at small and large radii, since the interesting curvature in the\nbody of the problem has to be carried into the origin and to infinity (where they become\n\"objectionable\").\nOur point here is not to argue for the direct application of the self-similar models\nof the current line of research to any known astrophysical object, but to point out their\npossible utility in the study of a restricted but extremely interesting subset of problems\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nin general relativity: the role of frame dragging, nontrivial equilibria with and without\nconvenient symmetries, gravitational collapse, the formation of singularities, the efficiency\nof the generation of gravitational radiation, etc. Computational results in this field are hard\nto obtain as it is; we should not shrink from applying a technique \u2013 self-similarity \u2013 that\nhas proven itself very fruitful in application to many subjects other than general relativity,\nsimply because its assumption produces a few blemishes in otherwise acceptable physical\nmodels.\nThis work has been supported in the United States by the National Science Foundation\nby a Graduate Fellowship awarded to MJC and by grant AST-9618491 awarded to FHS.
