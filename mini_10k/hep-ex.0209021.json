No signal is found and limits on the mass and couplings of the Higgs\nboson are derived. Interpreting the data in the framework of the Standard Model,\nthe 95% C.L. lower limit of 114.4 GeV on the Higgs boson mass is obtained.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) [1] of electroweak interactions is a well established theory\nwhich has been very successful in accounting for various experimental observations\nas well as in its predictions of new physics phenomena. The unproven keystone\nof the SM is the mechanism of mass generation. The most favoured one is the\nso-called Higgs mechanism [2]. A doublet of scalar complex fields with non-zero\nvacuum expectation value is postulated, breaking electroweak symmetry and generating weak boson and fermion masses. The Higgs mechanism gives rise to one more\nphysical state \u2212 the Higgs boson. The discovery of this particle would be a crucial\nstep in establishing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and in our\nunderstanding of the origin of mass. One Higgs doublet is the minimum which is\nrequired to generate weak boson and fermion masses. There are extensions of the\nSM postulating additional Higgs multiplets and thus predicting a spectrum of physical Higgs particles [3]. Over the last decade searches for Higgs bosons of various\ntheoretical models have been performed at the Tevatron pp\u0304 collider and the Large\nElectron-Positron (LEP) collider. The results of these searches are reviewed.\n2\n\nThe Standard Model Higgs Boson\n\n2.1 Search for the SM Higgs Boson at LEP\nOver the last three years of LEP running, the four LEP collaborations, ALEPH,\nDELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected 2460 pb\u22121 of data at centre-of-mass energies\nbetween 189 and 209 GeV with about 530 pb\u22121 above 206 GeV. These data provided\nsensitivity to the SM Higgs boson up to a mass of mH \u223c 115 GeV.\nAt LEP, the production of the Higgs boson is expected mainly via the\nHiggs-strahlung process, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u2217 \u2192 HZ. The processes of WW and ZZ fusion,\ngiving rise to the H\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 and He+ e\u2212 final states, contribute with a smaller rates to the\nHiggs boson production. The dependence of the production cross sections on the\nHiggs boson mass at a typical LEP energy, attained in the year 2000, is illustrated\nin Figure 1 (left). The SM Higgs boson decay branching fractions as a function of\nthe Higgs boson mass are displayed in Figure 1 (right).\nThe search for the SM Higgs boson is based on the study of four distinct\ntopologies, arising from the Higgs-strahlung process: HZ \u2192 qq\u0304qq\u0304 (four-jet channel);\nHZ \u2192 qq\u0304\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 (missing energy channel); HZ \u2192 qq\u0304l+ l\u2212 (l = e, \u03bc) (semileptonic channel) and HZ \u2192 qq\u0304\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 qq\u0304 (tau channels). Searches in channels with hadronic\ndecays of the Higgs boson are optimised for the H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay mode, which is pre2\n\n\f\u03c3 (pb)\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nH\u2192bb\n\n\u221as = 206.6 GeV\n-1\n\nBranching\n\n10\nTotal Cross Section\n-2\n\n10\n\nHiggsstrahlung\nFusion+Interference\n\n*\n\nH\u2192WW\n10\n\n-1\n\nH\u2192\u03c4+\u03c4-\n\nH\u2192gg\n\u2212\n\nH\u2192cc\nH\u2192ZZ*\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n10\n\n130\n\n-2\n\n100\n\nmH (GeV)\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\nmH GeV\n\nFigure 1: The production and decays of the\n\u221a SM Higgs boson. Left: the cross sections\nof the production mechanisms at LEP at s = 206.6 GeV as a function of mH . Right:\nthe decay branching fractions as a function of mH .\ndicted to be dominant in the mass range accessible at LEP. Hence, tagging b quarks\nplays a crucial role in identification of signal events. The main processes contributing\nto the background for the Higgs boson searches are: quark antiquak pair production with possible initial state radiation, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304(\u03b3), pair-wise production of W\nbosons, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 , pair-wise production of Z bosons, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ, single W\nboson production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 We\u03bd, and single Z boson production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Ze+ e\u2212 .\nThe results of the individual analyses are expressed in terms of one (or\nmore) final variable, also called discriminant. It is constructed, exploiting event\nfeatures, which discriminate between background and signal. Among them are the\ninvariant mass of the two jets (or two tau leptons) assumed to stem from the Higgs\nboson, hereafter called the reconstructed Higgs boson mass, mrec\nH , b-tag variable,\nquantifying the probability for an event to contain b jets, and topological characteristics of an event. As an example, Figure 2 shows the distribution of mrec\nH after\ncombining data from all four experiments in all search channels. The final variable,\nbuilt in the same way for data, Monte Carlo background and Monte Carlo signal\nsamples, is then used to evaluate on statistical basis the presence of a signal in data.\nAn excess of 3\u03c3 beyond background expectation compatible with the production of the Higgs boson with the mass near 115 GeV is reported by ALEPH\n3\n\n\fCLs\n\nEvents / 3 GeV/c2\n\n\u2013\n\n\u221as = 200-210 GeV\n\n12\n\n1\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\nLEP combined data\n\n8\n\nbackground\n\n10\n\n-1\n-2\n-3\n\nhZ Signal\n\n6\n\n(mh=115 GeV)\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\nLEP\n\n-4\n-5\n\nObserved\nExpected for\nbackground\n\n114.4\n\n115.3\n\n-6\n\n100 102 104 106 108 110 112 114 116 118 120\n2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nmH(GeV/c )\n\n120\n\nReconstructed Mass mH [GeV/c2]\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of the reconstructed Higgs boson mass, mrec\nH , obtained with a special, non-biasing, selection.

The\nsolid line: observation; the dashed line:\nexpectation in the absence of a signal.\nThe shaded areas represent 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3\nbands centred on the value expected in the\nabsence of a signal. Results from the four\nLEP collaborations are combined.\n\ncollaboration [4]. This effect comes from events of the HZ \u2192 qq\u0304qq\u0304 topology and is\nnot confirmed neither by other search channels nor by other LEP collaborations [5].\nIn the LEP combined search, the excess is diminished down to about 1.7\u03c3 [6] due to\nbackground-like observations by the other experiments. The LEP combined data are\nused to set a lower limit on the Higgs boson mass. Figure 3 shows the dependence of\nthe confidence level CLs , used to exclude the signal hypothesis, on the tested Higgs\nboson mass. An observation of the CLs value smaller than 5% means that the signal\nhypothesis is ruled out at 95% C.L.. A lower limit of 114.4 GeV on the mass of the\nSM Higgs boson is derived at 95% C.L..\n2.2 Searches for the SM Higgs Boson at Tevatron\nThe searches for the SM Higgs boson are performed by the CDF and D0 collaborations [7] using about 0.1 fb\u22121 of data collected per experiment at centre-of-mass\n\u221a\nenergy s = 1.8 TeV during the RunI data taking period at Tevatron.\nAlthough single Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, gg \u2192 H, has the\n4\n\n\fhighest cross-section, the more promising channels for the SM Higgs boson search\nare qq\u0304\u2032 \u2192 HW and qq\u0304 \u2192 HZ production, since a large fraction of copious QCD\nbackground can be suppressed by tagging leptons originating from decays of W\nor Z bosons. The Higgs boson is searched for by its decay into bb\u0304. Four final\nstates are studied: HZ \u2192 bb\u0304l+ l\u2212 (l = e, \u03bc); HZ \u2192 bb\u0304\u03bd \u03bd\u0304; HW \u2192 bb\u0304l\u03bd(l = e, \u03bc) and\nHZ(HW) \u2192 bb\u0304qq\u0304. Data are found to agree with the SM background predictions.\nHowever, the sensitivity of this search does not reach the SM expectations for a\nsignal: the 95% C.L. upper limit on the quantity \u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 HV) \u00d7 Br(H \u2192 bb\u0304) (where\nV stands for W and Z) is larger than the values predicted by the SM, as can be seen\nin Figure 4. Hence, a mass limit cannot be derived.\n\n- (pb)\n\u03c3(pp- \u2192 VH) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 bb)\n\nCDF PRELIMINARY Run 1\n95% C.L. upper limits\n- ll bb\nl\u03bd- bb\nqq bb\n\u03bd\u03bd bb\n\n10\n\nVH combined\n\n1\n\n10\n\nStandard Model\n\n-1\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\nFigure 4: The 95% C.L. upper limit set by CDF on the\nproduct of the HV (V is W\nand Z) production cross section and the branching fraction of H \u2192 bb\u0304 compared to\nthe SM prediction.

The Higgs sector of 2HDM is characterised by eight\ndegrees of freedom. After spontaneous symmetry breaking, three of them become\nlongitudinal polarisations of W and Z bosons, while the remaining five manifest\nthemselves as physical states: two neutral CP-even Higgs bosons, the lighter of\nwhich is denoted as h and the heavier as H, one CP-odd Higgs boson, A, and a pair\nof charged bosons, H\u00b1 . At this point one should mention two parameters of 2HDM,\nwhich play a crucial role in the Higgs boson phenomenology. These are tan \u03b2, the\n5\n\n\fratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and \u03b1, the mixing\nangle in the CP-even Higgs sector.\n3.1 Flavor Independent Search for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hZ\nThe distinct feature of 2HDM is the modified couplings of the Higgs bosons to\nfermions and gauge bosons. Table 1 illustrates the dependence of the neutral Higgs\nboson couplings to fermions on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 in 2HDM of type II, in\nwhich one Higgs doublet couples to up-type quarks while the other one to downtype quarks and charged leptons.

SM Higgs searches would have a reduced sensitivity in such cases, because\nof their strong reliance on identification of b-quarks. To investigate these specific\nscenarios, all four LEP collaborations have performed flavor independent searches\nfor hadronic decays of the Higgs bosons [8]. The preliminary LEP combination of\nthe search results is done for the Higgs-strahlung production mechanism1 [9]. All\ndecay channels of the Z boson are studied and decays of the Higgs boson into bb\u0304,\ncc\u0304 and a pair of gluons are considered. None of the LEP collaborations observes an\nindication of a signal and the search results are translated into the 95% C.L. upper\nlimits on the Higgs-strahlung cross section. This is shown in Figure 5. Assuming SM\ncross section for the Higgs-strahlung process and the hadronic branching fraction\nof the Higgs boson equal 1, a lower bound of 112.9 GeV on the Higgs boson mass\nis obtained at 95% C.L. regardless of the flavor content of the Higgs boson decay\nproducts.\n\n1\n\nFlavor independent searches were also performed for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hA production mechanism\nindividually by DELPHI, L3 and OPAL collaborations. However, no LEP combined results of\nthese searches are available yet.\n\n6\n\n\fXSEC/SM \u00d7BR(h \u2192hadrons)\n\nLEP PRELIMINARY\nHZ FLAVOUR BLIND HYPOTHESIS \u221as \u2264209 GeV\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nobserved\nexpected for background\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nmh (GeV)\n\nFigure 5: The 95% C.L. upper limit\non the Higgs-strahlung cross section, normalised to the value expected in the SM, as a function\nof the tested Higgs boson mass.\nThe limit is obtained from the LEP\ncombined flavor independent search\nfor the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hZ process assuming\nB(h \u2192 hadrons) equal 1. The solid\nline represents the observed limit, the\ndashed line stands for the expected\nlimit and the shaded areas show 1\u03c3\nand 2\u03c3 bands centred on the expected\nlimit .\n\n3.2 Searches for Charged Higgs Bosons\nAt LEP, charged Higgs bosons are expected to be produced in pairs through virtual\nZ or \u03b3 exchange: e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u2217 /\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 H+ H\u2212 . In 2HDM, the H\u00b1 mass is not predicted\nand the tree-level cross-section is fully determined by the mass. The searches are\ncarried out under the assumption that the two decay modes H+ \u2192 cs\u0304 and H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\nexhaust the H+ decay width but the relative branching ratio is regarded as a free\nparameter. Thus, the searches encompass the following final states: cs\u0304c\u0304s, \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304\nand cs\u0304\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304 + c\u0304s\u03c4 + \u03bd. An excess of candidates in the pure hadronic channel in the\nmass region around 68 GeV is found in the L3 data [10]. However, this effect is not\nconfirmed by other LEP experiments [11]. No signal is found in the pure leptonic\nand mixed channels. The results from the four collaborations are combined and\nused to set the 95% C.L. lower limit on the H+ mass in dependence of the branching\nfraction B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), as shown in Figure 6. A lower limit of 78.6 GeV on the H+\nmass is obtained at 95% C.L. independent of B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd).\nIn the SM, the primary decay of the top quark is t \u2192 W+ b. The addition of\nthe second Higgs doublet allows the t \u2192 H+ b mode, provided that mt > mH+ + mb .\nThe dependence of the branching fraction B(t \u2192 H+ b) on tan \u03b2 is presented in Fig+\nure 7 for several representative\nq values of the charged Higgs boson mass. B(t \u2192 H b)\nhas a minimum at tan \u03b2 = mt /mb . If tan \u03b2 differs by about a factor of 10 from\nq\n\nmt /mb , the branching fraction becomes large, and decreases as mH+ increases. Two\ndifferent searches for t \u2192 H+ b are performed at Tevatron. An indirect search [12]\nmakes use of the fact that a large branching fraction B(t \u2192 H+ b) suppresses decay\nrates of tt\u0304 into the W+ W\u2212 bb\u0304 final states. Hence, an observation of a decrease in\nthe tt\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 bb\u0304 signal expected from the SM would be an indirect indication\n7\n\n\fBr(H\u2192\u03c4\u03bd)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 6: The excluded region\nin the (B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), mH+ ) plane.\nPreliminary results from the four\nLEP collaboration are combined.\nThe shaded area is experimentally\nexcluded at 95% C.L..

Direct searches [13] aim to select the tt\u0304 \u2192 H+ bH\u2212 b\u0304 and\ntt\u0304 \u2192 H\u00b1 W\u2213 bb\u0304 final states, exploiting the H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd decay mode. The latter dominates at high tan \u03b2 values, as shown in Figure 7. The decay mode H+ \u2192 cs\u0304 is not\nuseful for direct searches due to a large QCD background. Dedicated analyses, performed at Tevatron, assume that there are no top quark decays other than t \u2192 W+ b\nand t \u2192 H+ b. No signal is found and the results are used to constrain parameters\nof 2HDM. As an example, Figure 8 presents D0 results, expressed in terms of the\n95% C.L. excluded regions in the (mH+ , tan \u03b2) plane.\n\nHiggs Mass (GeV)\n\n160\nDirect Search, Bayesian\nDirect Search, Frequentist\nIndirect Search, Bayesian\nIndirect Search, Frequentist\n\n140\n120\n100\n80\n1\n\n10\n\n100\ntan \u03b2\n\nFigure 7:\nBranching fractions\n+\nB(t \u2192 H b) and B(H+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) as a\nfunction of tan \u03b2.\n\nFigure 8: The 95% C.L. excluded regions\nin the (mH+ , tan \u03b2) plane for the top quark\nmass mt = 175 GeV and \u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304) =\n5.5 pb. Results are obtained by the D0\ncollaboration.\n\n8\n\n\f3.3 Searches for the Neutral Higgs Bosons of the MSSM\nSupersymmetry is a tempting theoretical concept which provides an elegant solution\nof the so-called \"hierarchy\" problem and incorporates gravity in a consistent way\ninto the model [15]. The Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of\nthe Standard Model (MSSM) [16] corresponds to the 2HDM of type II and hence\ncontains the five physical states indicated above.\nAt LEP, searches for the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM are performed,\nexploiting two production mechanisms: the Higgs-strahlung and associated Higgs\nboson pair production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u2217 \u2192 hA. For the Higgs-strahlung process, the same\nevent topologies as in the SM Higgs search are studied. For the hA production,\nthe final states studied are: hA \u2192 bb\u0304bb\u0304 and hA \u2192 bb\u0304\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 bb\u0304. To improve\nsearch sensitivity in the MSSM parameter regions where the decay h \u2192 AA opens,\nsome collaborations have searched also for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hZ \u2192 AAZ process [17]. No\nevidence for the production of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons is found in the LEP\ncombined data [18]. Hence, the search results are interpreted in terms of exclusion of\nthe MSSM parameter regions. Figure 9 shows the 95% C.L. excluded regions in the\n(tan \u03b2, mh ) plane for the so-called \"mh \u2212 max\" scenario, which yields the maximal\ntheoretical upper limit on mh in the model. In this scenario, the LEP combined\ndata establish the 95% C.L. lower limits on the h and A boson masses of 91.0 GeV\nand 91.9 GeV, respectively.\n\ntan\u03b2\n\nLEP 88-209 GeV Preliminary\n\nFigure 9: The 95 % C.L. exclusion\ncontours in the (tan \u03b2, mh ) projection for the \"mh \u2212 max\" scenario.\nThe results of the four LEP experiments are combined.

A dedicated analysis is elaborated to select events with four\nor more jets of which at least three being tagged as b jets. The study of dijet\ninvariant mass spectra in the selected sample revealed no evidence for a signal.\nShown in Figure 10 are the exclusion contours in the (tan \u03b2, mh ) plane for the two\nrepresentative scenarios of the scalar top mixing.\n\nFigure 10: The 95% C.L. excluded regions in the (tan \u03b2, mh ) plane for the two scalar\ntop mixing scenarios : a) \"no mixing\", b) \"maximal mixing\". Results are obtained\nby the CDF collaboration. The LEP excluded regions shown here are obsolete.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nSearches for Higgs bosons of various theoretical models are performed at LEP and\nTevatron. No strong indication of the production of Higgs bosons is found. Negative\nresults of the searches are used to constrain parameters in the Higgs sector of the\nSM and its various extensions. In the SM, the 95% C.L. lower limit of 114.4 GeV\non the Higgs boson mass is obtained from the direct searches at LEP.\nSearches for Higgs bosons will be one of the main objectives during the\nRunII data taking period at Tevatron. Higgs searches will be also continued at\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. If the Higgs boson is found, its profile\n10\n\n\fwill be explored at a future linear e+ e\u2212 collider. The physics results from these\nexperimental facilities are anticipated to shed a light on the problem of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking and give an insight into the origin of mass.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Dr. Wolfgang Lohmann for giving talk at Physics in Collision Conference\non behalf of my name and for his help in preparation of this paper.\nReferences\n1.
