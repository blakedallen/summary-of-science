We consider the problem in a framework in which\nadjoint chiral multiplets are introduced and gauginos have Dirac mass terms induced\nby a U(1) gauge interaction in the hidden sector.

When the supersymmetric adjoint masses are\nsuppressed by a factor of \u223c 100 compared with the Dirac ones, the electron and\nneutron EDMs are suppressed below the experimental bound even if the SUSY\nparticle masses are around 1 TeV. Thus, this model works as a framework to solve\nthe SUSY CP problem.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrigin of gaugino masses is one of the important issues in supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the standard model (SM). In the minimal supergravity model [1], a hidden sector is\nintroduced, and its interactions with the observable sector are assumed to be suppressed by\nthe gravitational scale. Majorana gaugino mass terms in the minimal SUSY SM (MSSM)\nare derived by a singlet chiral multiplet with non-vanishing F -component in the hidden\nsector. However, introduction of the singlet chiral multiplet makes this model in trouble.\nFirst, other F -term SUSY breaking terms in the scalar potential, the A and B terms,\nare also generated by the singlet chiral multiplet, and they have O(1) phases relative to\ngaugino masses generically. They contribute to the electron and neutron electric dipole\nmoments (EDMs) beyond the experimental bounds unless the SUSY particle masses are\nheavier than several TeV. This is called as the SUSY CP problem [2, 3].\nSecond is a cosmological problem called as the Polonyi problem [4]. This problem\nwas considered not to be serious when the Polonyi field gets a mass of the dynamical\nSUSY breaking scale. However, it is recently pointed out that the Polonyi problem is\nmore serious in hidden sector models in which a singlet chiral multiplet acquires F -term\nvacuum expectation value (VEV) to generate the gaugino masses [5]. The linear term of\nthe singlet field is allowed in the K\u00e4hler potential. When the Hubble parameter during\ninflation is not small enough, the linear term destabilizes the minimum of the singlet scalar\n(Polonyi) field during the inflation, and the Polonyi problem is revived.\nTherefore, it is one of the ways to construct a realistic SUSY SM to assume that the\nhidden sector has no singlet chiral field. Even if the hidden sector have no singlet chiral\nfield, Majorana gaugino mass terms are generated by the pure supergravity (anomaly\nmediation) effect [6]. However, they are suppressed by one-loop factors compared with the\ngravitino mass. When the particle contents in the SUSY SM are minimal, the B parameter\nin the Higgs potential is of the order of the gravitino mass. Thus, we need to extend this\nmodel furthermore.\nAn alternative way to generate gaugino mass terms is introduction of adjoint chiral\nsuperfields into the SUSY SM [7]. When the hidden sector has a U(1) gauge multiplet\nwhose D component is non-vanishing, Dirac mass terms with gauginos and the adjoint\nfermions are generated [8, 9]. Their sizes can be comparable to the gravitino mass. Since\nthe gaugino Majorana mass terms are also generated by the anomaly mediation effect, the\ngauginos are pseudoDirac fermions. We call this model as PseudoDirac Gaugino (PDG)\nmodel.\nIn this paper we discuss the electron and neutron EDMs in the PDG model. The\nDirac gaugino mass term is U(1)R invariant, and it is pointed out that the EDMs are\nsuppressed in a U(1)R symmetric limit [7], in which the Majorana gaugino mass terms,\nthe supersymmetric Higgs mass term, and the A terms are vanishing. The U(1)R breaking\nterms are introduced by the supergravity effects in the PDG model. We found that the\nEDMs are still suppressed when the supersymmetric adjoint multiplet mass is small. Thus,\nthe PDG model is a framework to solve the SUSY CP problem.\n1\n\n\fThis paper is organized as follows. In next section we review the PDG model in detail,\nand also discuss the SUSY particle mass spectrum. In Section 3 we discuss the CP violation\nand the EDMs derived from it. Section 4 is devoted to Conclusions and Discussion.\n\n2\n\nModel\n\nAs mentioned in Introduction, we assume that the hidden sector has no singlet chiral multiplet, and that the interactions with observable sector are suppressed by the gravitational\nscale M\u22c6 (\u2261 2.4\u00d71018 GeV). Furthermore, it is assumed for simplicity that the hidden sector does not have fields with VEV\u223c M\u22c6 . In this case, the Majorana gaugino masses in the\nSUSY SM are derived by the anomaly mediation effect, and they are one-loop suppressed\ncompared with the gravitino mass (m3/2 ) as\n\u03bcg\u0303i =\n\n\u03b2i (gi2)\nF\u03c6 .\n2gi2\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere, \u03b2i (gi2) (i = Y, 2, 3) are the beta functions for U(1)Y , SU(2)L and SU(3)C gauge\ncoupling constants squared and F\u03c6 is proportional to m3/2 .\nOn the other hand, the scalar masses in the SUSY SM are comparable to the gravitino\nmass unless the K\u00e4hler potential has a sequestering form between the hidden and observable sectors. We assume that the sfermion mass universality is imposed by some flavor\nsymmetries or underlying physics.\nIn order to give sizable masses to the gauginos, we introduce adjoint chiral multiplets\nto each gauge multiplet in the SUSY SM. The adjoint fermions and the gauginos get Dirac\nmass terms by a VEV of the D component of a U(1) gauge field in the hidden sector. The\nkinetic terms of the adjoint and gauge multiplets and their interaction with the U(1) gauge\nfield are given as follows,\n(\n!\n)\n\u221a\nZ\nX\n1\n2ci\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2032\nL=\nd\u03b8\nTr[\nW Wi\u03b1 ] \u2212\nTr[Wi W\u03b1 \u03a3i ] + h.c.\n4ki gi2 i\nki gi2 M\u22c6\ni=Y,2,3\nZ\nX 1\nTr[\u03a3\u2020i e\u22122Vi \u03a3i e2Vi ].\n(2.2)\n+ d4 \u03b8\n2\nk\ng\ni\ni\ni=Y,2,3\nHere, Wi\u03b1 and \u03a3i are gauge field strengths and adjoint multiplets, respectively, and their\ninteraction with the U(1) gauge field in the hidden sector, W\u03b1\u2032 , is suppressed by the\ngravitational scale M\u22c6 . When the U(1) gauge multiplet in the hidden sector get the Dcomponent VEV hW\u03b1\u2032 i = D\u03b8\u03b1 , the Dirac masses for the gauginos and adjoint fermions\nare given as MDi = ci D/M\u22c6 . We assume D/M\u22c6 \u223c m3/2 so that the gaugino masses are\ncomparable to the scalar masses in the SUSY SM.\nThe U(1)R charges for the adjoint multiplets are zero in this model, as expected from\nEq. (2.2). Thus, their supersymmetric mass terms vanish in a U(1)R symmetric limit,\n2\n\n\fsimilar to those of the Higgs multiplets in the SUSY SM, H1 and H2 . The supergravity\neffect also may generate the mass terms when following terms are present in the K\u00e4hler\npotential [10, 11],\n(\n)\nZ\n\u2020\nX c\u03a3\n\u03c6\ni\ncH H 1 H 2 +\nTr[\u03a32i ] + h.c..\n(2.3)\nL = \u2212 d4 \u03b8\n2\n\u03c6\n2k\ng\ni\ni\ni=Y,2,3\nHere, \u03c6(= 1 + F\u03c6 \u03b82 ) is the compensator chiral multiplet in supergravity. From Eq. (2.3),\nthe supersymmetric Higgs (\u03bcH ) and adjoint masses (\u03bc\u03a3i ) and their B parameters (BH and\nB\u03a3i ) are given as\n\u03bcH\nBH\n\u03bc \u03a3i\nB\u03a3i\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ncH F\u03c6\u22c6 ,\n\u2212F\u03c6 ,\nc\u03a3i F\u03c6\u22c6 ,\n\u2212F\u03c6 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nWhen the Higgs and adjoint chiral multiplets have M\u22c6 -suppressed interactions with a\nnon-singlet chiral multiplet Z in the hidden sector as\n(\n)\nZ\n\u2020\nX c\u2032\u03a3\nZ\nZ\ni\nd4 \u03b8 2 c\u2032H H1 H2 +\nTr[\u03a32i ] + h.c.,\n(2.5)\n2\nM\u22c6\n2k\ng\ni\ni\ni=Y,2,3\ntheir B parameters and supersymmetric masses are changed from Eqs. (2.4). However, if\nthe VEV for Z is not as large as \u223c M\u22c6 , the supergravity contributions in Eq. (2.4) are\nstill dominant in the supersymmetric masses.\nThe sizes of \u03bc\u03a3i and \u03bcH depend on underlying physics. Even if c\u03a3i and cH are zero\nat tree level, they may be induced radiatively. For example, when the massive chiral\nmultiplets X and X\u0304 have an interaction with \u03a3i , f X X\u0304\u03a3i , c\u03a3i is generated at one-loop\nlevel as c\u03a3i \u223c f 2 /(4\u03c0)2 , and it is not suppressed by the mass of X and X\u0304. Thus, c\u03a3i and\ncH are expected to be larger than O(10\u2212(2\u22123) ). In the following we assume that MDi >\n\u223c \u03bc \u03a3i\nso that the gauginos are pseudoDirac.\nThe successful gauge coupling unification in the MSSM is spoiled in the PDG model,\nsince the adjoint chiral multiplets are introduced in the SUSY SM. In order to recover the\nunification, it is pointed out in Ref. [8, 9] that the adjoint chiral multiplets are embedded in\ncomplete multiplets under the GUT gauge group and the additional fields in the multiplets,\nwhich are called as bachelor fields, are introduced. The candidates for the GUT gauge\ngroup are SU(5) and SU(3)3 . The low-energy gauge coupling constants favor the bachelor\nmasses (MB ) are 10(5\u22129) GeV and the GUT scale is 10(17\u221218) GeV. It is economical if the\nGUT scale is close to the gravitational scale.\nThe low-energy mass spectrum in the PDG model is affected by the radiative correction,\nand it depends on detail of the models between the weak scale and the gravitational scale.\nWe introduce the bachelor fields as a working hypothesis and take the GUT scale to be M\u22c6\n3\n\n\fin the following. The contribution of the adjoint and bachelor fields to the beta functions\nfor gauge coupling constants (bB ) is 5(3) in the SU(5) model (the SU(3)3 model). The\nDirac gaugino masses at low energy are given from the one-loop renormalization group\n(RG) equations as\nMDY\nMDY\n(mSU SY ) =\n(M\u22c6 ),\ngY\ngY\n\u0013\u2212 2 \u0012\n\u0013\u2212 2\n\u0012\nMD2\n\u03b12 (mSU SY ) 3 \u03b12 (MB ) 1+bB MD2\n(mSU SY ) =\n(M\u22c6 ),\ng2\n\u03b12 (MB )\n\u03b12 (M\u22c6 )\ng2\n\u0012\n\u0013 3\u03b13 (m2\u03c0SU SY ) \u0012\n\u0013\u2212 3\nMD3\n\u03b13 (MB ) \u22123+bB MD3\nMB\n(mSU SY ) =\n(M\u22c6 ).\ng3\nmSU SY\n\u03b13 (M\u22c6 )\ng3\n\n(2.6)\n\nWhen bB = 3, the SU(3) gaugino mass becomes\nMD3\n(mSU SY ) =\ng3\n\n\u0012\n\nM\u22c6\nmSU SY\n\n\u0013 3\u03b13 (m2\u03c0SU SY )\n\nMD3\n(M\u22c6 ).\ng3\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe gaugino mass differences among the gauge groups are larger than those in the MSSM\nunder the minimal supergravity assumption (cMSSM), in whichp\nthe gaugino mass ratios are\ngiven by those of squares of the gauge coupling constants. If 3/5MDY /gY = MD2 /g2 =\nMD3 /g3 at M\u22c6 , the gaugino mass ratios in the SU(3)3 model are MD2 /MDY \u2243 (2.3 \u2212 2.6)\nand MD3 /MDY \u2243 11, depending on MB . In the SU(5) model, the ratios are larger than\nthose in the SU(3)3 model, MD2 /MDY \u2243 (2.3 \u2212 4.3) and MD3 /MDY \u2243 (11 \u2212 31). This is\nbecause the gauge coupling constants at M\u22c6 are quite large when MB \u223c 10(7\u22128) GeV.\nThe adjoint supersymmetric masses \u03bc\u03a3i also receive sizable radiative corrections. The\nfollowing combination including \u03bc\u03a3i is RG invariant at one-loop level,\n\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bc\u03a3i\n,\nMD2 i\n\n(2.8)\n\nfor i = Y, 2, 3.\nThe light Higgs boson is predicted to be lighter in the PDG model, relatively to the\nMSSM. It is, unfortunately, contrary to null results of the Higgs boson searches. The first\nreason comes from the quartic coupling of the Higgs boson given from Eq. (2.2) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm2AY\nm2A2\n1\n2\n2\ng +\ng\n.\n(2.9)\n8 m2A2 + 4MD2 2 2 m2AY + 4MD2 Y Y\nHere, we take simply \u03bc\u03a3i B\u03a3i \u2243 0 and \u03bc\u03a3i \u2243 0, and mAi (i = Y, 2) are the SUSY breaking\nmasses of the adjoint scalars for U(1)Y and SU(2)L [8]. The MSSM quartic coupling is\nrecovered in a case of mAi \u226b MDi . The quartic coupling is suppressed when mAi \u223c MDi ,\nand the Higgs boson mass becomes lighter. The second reason is that while the large A\nparameter for top squarks enhances the radiative correction to the light Higgs boson mass\n4\n\n\f[12], it is one-loop suppressed in the PDG model. Since the hidden sector have no singlet\nfields, the A parameters come from only the anomaly mediation similar to the Majorana\ngaugino masses. The A parameters for the supersymmetric Yukawa coupling \u03bbf lm are\ngiven as\nAf lm = \u2212(\u03b3f + \u03b3l + \u03b3m )F\u03c6\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u03b3f is the anomalous dimension for a field f . These implies from null results of the\nlight Higgs boson searches that the large top squark masses (>\n\u223c 1 TeV) are required so\nthat the radiative correction to the Higgs boson mass is enhanced.\nIn the PDG model the radiative corrections to the scalar masses due to non-vanishing\nDirac gaugino masses are finite and are not enhanced by a logarithm. This nature is\ncalled as \"supersoft\" [8]. The first and second-generation sfermions do not receive large\nradiative corrections to the mass terms when the gaugino masses are comparable to the\nsfermion masses and the U(1)Y D-term contribution to the RG equations is zero. The\nthird generation sfermions and Higgs boson masses get RG effects by the large Yukawa\ninteraction.\n\n3\n\nElectron and neutron EDMs\n\nFirst, we review electron and neutron EDMs in the MSSM briefly, and show the constraints\non the CP phases in the parameters in the model. In the MSSM the new sources of\nCP violation in the flavor-conserving terms are phases in the gaugino masses, A and B\nparameters, and the supersymmetric Higgs mass. The physical CP phases are following\ntwo due to degrees of freedom for rephasing, U(1)R and U(1)P Q ,\n\u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 \u2261 arg(\u03bcH \u03bcg\u0303i (\u03bcH BH )\u22c6 ), \u03c6Af \u2261 arg(\u03bcg\u0303i A\u22c6f ).\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere the gaugino mass unification in GUTs and universality of A parameters are assumed.\nThe relevant CP-violating operators for the electron and neutron EDMs are following\nup to dimension six [13],\nL(C)EDM = \u2212\n\nX\n\nf =e,u,d\n\n+\u03b8\n\ni\n\ndf  \u0304\nf (F * \u03c3)\u03b35 f\n2\n\nX dcq\n1\n\u03b1s\ni q\u0304(gs G * \u03c3)\u03b35 q + \u03c9GG\u0303G,\nGG\u0303 \u2212\n8\u03c0\n2\n3\nq=u,d\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd and G\u03bc\u03bd are the electromagnetic and the SU(3)C gauge field strengths, respectively. The terms in the second line are the flavor-conserving CP-violating terms in QCD,\nand the first term is the QCD theta term. Here, we simply assume Peccei-Quinn symmetry\nfor it. The second and third terms are quark chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs)\nand the Weinberg operator, respectively.\n5\n\n\fThe current experimental bound on the electron EDM is |de | < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221227 ecm from\nthe 205 Tl EDM measurement [14]. The neutron EDM bound is recently improved as\n|dn | < 2.9 \u00d7 10\u221226 ecm [15]. The evaluation of the neutron EDM from the parton level is\nstill a difficult task. Here, we use a formula derived from the QCD sum rule [16], in which\nthe valence quark contribution to the EDM is evaluated#1 ,\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\ndn\n|hq\u0304qi|\ndd\ndu\nc\nc\n.\n(3.13)\n= (1 \u00b1 0.5)\n1.1 (dd + 0.5du ) + 1.4\n\u2212 0.25\ne\n(225 MeV)3\ne\ne\nThe Weinberg operator contribution to the neutron EDM is also evaluated as [19]\ndn\n\u2243 \u03c9 \u00d7 22 MeV,\ne\n\n(3.14)\n\nthough it has more uncertainties.\nIn the MSSM the electron EDM is given as\nX\nde\n(e)\n(e)\u2032\n=\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] di (|\u03bcg\u0303i |2 ) + Im [\u03bcg\u0303Y A\u22c6l ] dY (|\u03bcg\u0303Y |2 ),\ne\ni=Y,2\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhile the quark EDMs and CEDMs are given as\nX\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003 (q)\u2032\ndq\n(q)\n=\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] di (|\u03bcg\u0303i |2 ) +\nIm \u03bcg\u0303i A\u22c6q di (|\u03bcg\u0303i |2 ),\ne\ni=Y,2,3\ni=Y,3\nX\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003 (q)\u2032\n(q)\nc\n2\ndq =\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] d \u0304i (|\u03bcg\u0303i | ) +\nIm \u03bcg\u0303i A\u22c6q d \u0304i (|\u03bcg\u0303i |2 ),\ni=Y,2,3\n\n(3.16)\n\ni=Y,3\n\nwhere q = u, d and we take a basis in which \u03bcH BH is real. The mass functions for EDMs,\n(f )\n(f )\u2032\n(f )\n(f )\u2032\ndi (x) and di (x) (f = e, u, d), and those for CEDMs, d \u0304i (x) and d \u0304i (x) (f = u, d), are\ndefined for convenience to evaluate the EDMs and CEDMs in the PDG model later. The\nexplicit forms in a limit mSU SY \u226b mZ are given in Appendix. More complete formulae\ncan be derived from those in Ref. [3]. The Weinberg operator contribution to the neutron\nEDM is subdominant in the MSSM except for cases in some specific mass spectrum, and\nthen it is ignored here.\nIn a limit of common SUSY breaking parameters mSU SY , the EDMs and CEDMs are\n\u0013\n\u0012\nme tan \u03b2\n\u03b1Y\nme\n5\u03b12 \u03b1Y\nde\n=\u2212\n+\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 \u2212\nsin \u03c6Al ,\n(3.17)\n2\ne\n24\n24 4\u03c0mSU SY\n12 4\u03c0m2SU SY\n#1\n\nThe sea quarks, including strange quark, may contribute to the neutron EDM sizable [17]. In this\npaper we ignore them for simplicity since the evaluation still has uncertainties. The mercury EDM [18]\nis also sensitive to the quark CEDMs, and the bound is as stringent as the neutron one though it is also\nexpected to suffer from larger hadronic uncertainties than neutron one due to the nuclear dynamics [13].\n\n6\n\n\fand\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nmd tan \u03b2\nmd\n2\u03b13 7\u03b12 11\u03b1Y\n\u03b1Y\n2\u03b13\ndd\n=\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 \u2212\nsin \u03c6Ad ,\n2\ne\n27\n24\n648 4\u03c0mSU SY\n27\n324 4\u03c0m2SU SY\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n5\u03b13 \u03b12 11\u03b1Y\nmd tan \u03b2\nmd\n\u03b1Y\n5\u03b13\nc\ndd = \u2212\n+\n+\n+\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 \u2212\nsin \u03c6Ad ,\n2\n18\n8\n216 4\u03c0mSU SY\n18\n108 4\u03c0m2SU SY\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nmu\n4\u03b13 \u03b12 5\u03b1Y mu tan\u22121 \u03b2\n4\u03b13 \u03b1Y\ndu\n=+\n+\n\u2212\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 +\n+\nsin \u03c6Au ,\n2\ne\n27\n4\n324\n4\u03c0mSU SY\n27\n81 4\u03c0m2SU SY\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nmu\n5\u03b13 \u03b12 5\u03b1Y mu tan\u22121 \u03b2\n5\u03b13 \u03b1Y\nc\ndu = \u2212\n+\n+\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 \u2212\n\u2212\nsin \u03c6Au .\n2\n18\n8\n216\n4\u03c0mSU SY\n18\n54 4\u03c0m2SU SY\n(3.18)\nFrom these equations, the phases are constrained as\n\u0010m\n\u00112 \u0012 tan \u03b2 \u0013\u22121\n\u00112\n\u0010 m\nSU SY\nSU SY\n| sin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 | <\n, | sin \u03c6Af | <\n,\n6.1 TeV\n10\n0.65 TeV\nfrom the experimental bound on the electron EDM, and\n\u00112 \u0012 tan \u03b2 \u0013\u22121\n\u00112\n\u0010m\n\u0010m\nSU SY\nSU SY\n| sin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 | <\n, | sin \u03c6Af | <\n,\n12 TeV\n10\n3.7 TeV\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nfrom neutron one. Here, we use \u03b13 (mZ ) = 0.1176, \u03b1\u22121 (mZ ) = 127.918, sin2 \u03b8W (mZ ) =\n0.23122 [20], md (mZ ) = 4.1 MeV and mu (mZ ) = 2.4 MeV#2 and the QCD corrections\nto the dipole operators are ignored. The center value in Eq. (3.13) is taken in evaluation\nof Eq. (3.20). The down quark contribution tends to dominate in the neutron EDM.\nEspecially, it is significant when sin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 6= 0. It is found from these bounds that the SUSY\nparticles should be larger than several TeV when the CP phase is O(1).\nIn the PDG model the complex parameters introduced are\nMDi , \u03bcg\u0303i , \u03bc\u03a3i , B\u03a3i (i = Y, 2, 3),\n\u03bcH , BH , Af (f = u, d, l).\n\n(3.21)\n\nDegrees of freedom for rephasing come from phase transformations of adjoint fields in\naddition to U(1)R and U(1)P Q in the MSSM. Thus, the physical CP phases are four,\nincluding \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 and \u03c6Af in Eq. (3.11), when assuming GUT and universality of the A terms.\nThe new phases in the PDG model are\n\u03c6\u03bc\u03a3 \u2261 arg(\u03bcH \u03bc\u22c6\u03a3i (\u03bcH BH )\u22c6 MD2 i ), \u03c6B\u03a3 \u2261 arg(\u03bc\u03a3i B\u03a3i MD\u22c62i ).\nIn the following we take a basis in which MDi and \u03bcH BH are real for convenience.\n#2\n\nThese values are evaluated from md (1 GeV) = 8.9 MeV and mu (1 GeV) = 5.1 MeV [21].\n\n7\n\n(3.22)\n\n\fWhen the hidden sector does not have singlet chiral multiplets, the A parameters and\nthe Majorana gaugino masses are dominated by the anomaly mediation contribution as in\nEqs. (2.1) and (2.10), and their phases are automatically aligned. That is, \u03c6Af = 0. On\nthe other hand, the B parameters still have other contributions even in the case, and \u03c6B\u03a3\nand \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 do not necessarily vanish. The adjoint scalar bosons are not directly coupled to\nquarks and leptons. The CP phase \u03c6B\u03a3 contributes to the EDMs at three-loop level via\nthe Weinberg operator [7]. We evaluate the EDMs in \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 6= 0 and \u03c6\u03bc\u03a3 6= 0, first. The\nWeinberg operator contribution in \u03c6B\u03a3 6= 0 is discussed later.\nThe adjoint fermions are also coupled to quarks and leptons via the gauginos. Thus,\nwhen \u03bcg\u0303i and \u03bc\u03a3i \u226a MDi , the one-loop contributions to the EDMs and CEDMs are derived\nfrom those in the MSSM as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nX\u001a\n\u0002 \u22c6\n\u0003 2 \u2202\nde\n\u2202\n(e)\n(e)\n2\n2\n2\n=\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] 1 + MDi\ndi (MDi ) + Im \u03bc\u03a3i \u03bcH MDi\ndi (MDi )\n2\n2\ne\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\nD\nD\ni\ni\ni=Y,2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(e)\u2032\n(e)\u2032\ndY (MD2 Y ) \u2212 Im [\u03bc\u03a3Y Al ] MD2 Y\ndY (MD2 Y ),\n+ Im [\u03bcg\u0303Y A\u22c6l ] 1 + MD2 Y\n2\n2\n\u2202MDY\n\u2202MDY\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nX\n\u0002 \u22c6\n\u0003 2 \u2202\ndq\n\u2202\n(q)\n(q)\n2\n2\n2\n=\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] 1 + MDi\ndi (MDi ) + Im \u03bc\u03a3i \u03bcH MDi\ndi (MDi )\n2\n2\ne\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\nD\nD\ni\ni\ni=Y,2,3\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0012\nX\u001a \u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(q)\u2032\n(q)\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u22c6\ndi (MDi ) \u2212 Im [\u03bc\u03a3i Aq ] MDi\nd (MDi ) ,\nIm \u03bcg\u0303i Aq 1 + MDi\n+\n\u2202MD2 i\n\u2202MD2 i i\ni=Y,3\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0012\nX \u001a\n\u0002 \u22c6\n\u0003 2 \u2202\n\u2202\n(q)\n(q)\n2\n2\nc\n2\nd \u0304i (MDi ) + Im \u03bc\u03a3i \u03bcH MDi\nd \u0304i (MDi )\ndq =\nIm [\u03bcg\u0303i \u03bcH ] 1 + MDi\n2\n2\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\nD\nD\ni\ni\ni=Y,2,3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nX\u001a \u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\n\u2202  \u0304(q)\u2032 2\n(q)\u2032\n2\n\u22c6\n2\n2\n \u0304\n+\nIm \u03bcg\u0303i Aq 1 + MDi\ndi (MDi ) \u2212 Im [\u03bc\u03a3i Aq ] MDi\nd (MDi ) ,\n\u2202MD2 i\n\u2202MD2 i i\ni=Y,3\n\n(3.23)\n\n(q = u, d).

Here, F\u03c6 /MD = 1, \u03bc\u03a3i = 0 and\nsin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 = 1. The other assumptions and input parameters are the same as in Fig. 1.\nIt is found from the figure that if |\u03bc\u03a3i /MD | <\n\u223c 0.01, the EDMs are suppressed below the\nexperimental bounds even when m0 and MD are smaller than 1 TeV.\nIn Fig. 2 the electron and neutron EDMs are shown in a case of \u03bc\u03a3i = 0, |F\u03c6 /MD | = 1\nand sin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 = 1.#3 Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 1. In this case, the phases\nin the Majorana gaugino mass terms are the dominant sources of CP violation in the\nEDMs. Even if \u03bc\u03a3i is suppressed, the Majorana gaugino masses are derived by the anomaly\nmediation effect. Thus, the evaluated EDMs are the lowerbounds on the EDMs in the PDG\nmodel unless accidental cancellation suppress the EDMs.\nThe EDMs in the case of \u03bc\u03a3i = 0 and sin \u03c6\u03bcg\u0303 = 1 are much suppressed below the current\nexperimental bounds. Especially, the electron EDM is suppressed by the cancellation when\n>\nm0 <\n\u223c 2 TeV and MD \u223c 1.5 TeV. However, the finite values are still predicted so that the\nfuture experiments may cover them.\nThe neutron EDM measurements will be improved at SNS and ILL in near future,\nand it is argued that their sensitivities may reach to \u223c 10\u221228 ecm [22]. The deuteron\nEDM is also planned to be measured in the storage ring with sensitivity 10\u221229 ecm, which\ncorresponds to dn \u223c 10\u2212(29\u221230) ecm [23, 22]. The electron EDM measurements using\npolarizable paramagnetic molecules are aiming to the sensitivities of 10\u221229 ecm [24, 22].\nFinally, we discuss the Weinberg operator induced by non-zero \u03c6B\u03a3 . It is derived at\ntwo-loop diagrams, and roughly evaluated by dimensional counting as\n\u03c9 \u223c\n\n\u03b132 Im[\u03bc\u03a33 B\u03a33 ]\n.\n(4\u03c0)2 m4SU SY\n\n#3\n\n(3.25)\n\nNotice that in the PDG model the one-loop beta function for the SU(3)C gauge coupling constant\nis zero. Thus, non-vanishing \u03bcg\u03033 is derived at two-loop level, and the gluino contribution to the quark\n(C)EDM in sin \u03c6\u03bc\u03a3 = 0 is subdominant.\n\n10\n\n\fThus, the neutron EDM is derived from it as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIm[\u03bc\u03a33 B\u03a33 ] \u0010 mSU SY \u0011\u22122\n\u221226\ndn \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\necm \u00d7\n,\nm2SU SY\n1 TeV\n\n(3.26)\n\nthough it also suffers from large hadronic uncertainties. The Weinberg operator contribution is marginal to the current bound on the neutron EDM if \u03bc\u03a33 B\u03a33 is not suppressed.\nWhen the supersymmetric adjoint mass terms and the SUSY breaking term associated\nwith them come from independent terms, such as in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.5), \u03bc\u03a33 B\u03a33 may be\ncomparable to m23/2 while \u03bc\u03a33 \u226a m3/2 . In such models, the Weinberg operator contribution would be dominant in the neutron EDM.\n\n4\n\nConclusions and Discussion\n\nThe SUSY CP problem is one of the serious problems in construction of realistic SUSY\nSMs. We consider the problem in a framework in which the gaugino mass terms are Diractype ones induced by a U(1) gauge interaction in the hidden sector. The adjoint chiral\nmultiplets are introduced to have the Dirac mass terms. This model is called as the PDG\nmodel in this paper. The setup is also preferable from a viewpoint of the Polonyi problem,\nsince we do not need to introduce singlet chiral superfields in the hidden sector in order\nto derive the gaugino masses as in the minimal supergravity model.\nWe find that the dominant contributions to the electron and neutron EDMs in the\nPDG model come from the phases in the supersymmetric adjoint mass terms. When the\nsupersymmetric adjoint masses are suppressed by a factor of \u223c 100 compared with the\nDirac ones, the neutron and electron EDMs are suppressed below the experimental bounds\neven if the SUSY particle masses are around 1 TeV. Thus, this model works as a framework\nto solve the SUSY CP problem.\nThe electron and neutron EDMs are suppressed in the PDG model, however, the predicted values may be covered in the near future experiments. Even if the supersymmetric\nadjoint masses are much suppressed, the Majorana gaugino mass terms, which are induced\nby the anomaly mediation effect, may induce large enough neutron EDM to be observed\nin near future experiments. In addition to it, the phase in the B term of the adjoint scalar\nboson contributes to the Weinberg operator. It is not necessarily suppressed even if the\nsupersymmetric adjoint mass is. In the case, the Weinberg operator would be dominant\nin the neutron EDM.\nIn this paper, we consider only the CP-violating terms which are flavor-conserving.\nThe flavor-violating ones also contribute to the EDMs in the SUSY SM. Especially, when\nboth the left- and right-handed sfermions have the flavor-mixing mass terms, the phases\nin them contribute to the EDMs at one-loop level. Even if the sfermion mixing angles are\nsuppressed similar to the CKM ones, the EDMs can reach to the experimental bounds\nin the MSSM [25]. These contributions are also suppressed in the PDG model, since the\ncontributions are proportional to the Majorana bino or gluino masses.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe works of JH and MS are supported in part by the Grant-in-Aid for Science Research,\nMinistry of Education, Science and Culture, Japan (No. 1554055 and No. 18034002 for JH\nand No. 18840011 for MS).
