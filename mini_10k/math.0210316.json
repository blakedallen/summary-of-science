Introduction\nHeegaard splittings have recently been shown to be related to a number of\nimportant conjectures in 3-manifold theory: the virtually Haken conjecture, the\npositive virtual b1 conjecture and the virtually fibred conjecture [3]. Of particular\nimportance is the rate at which the Heegaard genus of finite-sheeted covering\nspaces grows as a function of their degree. This was encoded in the following\ndefinitions.\nLet M be a compact orientable 3-manifold. Let \u03c7h\u2212 (M ) be the negative of\nthe maximal Euler characteristic of a Heegaard surface for M . Let \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (M ) be the\nnegative of the maximal Euler characteristic of a strongly irreducible Heegaard\nsurface for M , or infinity if such a surface does not exist. Define the infimal\nHeegaard gradient of M to be\ninf {\ni\n\n\u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )\n: Mi is a degree di cover of M }.\ndi\n\nThe infimal strong Heegaard gradient of M is\nlim inf {\ni\n\n\u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi )\n: Mi is a degree di cover of M }.\ndi\n\nThe following conjectures were put forward in [3]. According to Theorem\n1.7 of [3], either of these conjectures, together with a conjecture of Lubotzky and\nSarnak [4] about the failure of Property (\u03c4 ) for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, would\nimply the virtually Haken conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\nHeegaard gradient conjecture. A compact orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold\nhas zero infimal Heegaard gradient if and only if it virtually fibres over the circle.\nStrong Heegaard gradient conjecture. Any closed orientable hyperbolic 3manifold has positive infimal strong Heegaard gradient.\nSome evidence for these conjectures was presented in [3]. More precisely,\nsuitably phrased versions of these conjectures were shown to be true when one\n1\n\n\frestricts attention to cyclic covers dual to a non-trivial element of H2 (M, \u2202M ), to\nreducible manifolds and (in the case of the strong Heegaard gradient conjecture)\nto congruence covers of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\nA less quantitative version of the conjectures is simply that \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi ) cannot\ngrow too slowly as a function of di , and that if \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ) does grow sufficiently slowly,\nthen M is virtually fibred. These expectations are confirmed in the following\nresult, which is the main theorem of this paper.\nTheorem 1. Let M be a closed orientable 3-manifold that admits a negatively\ncurved Riemannian metric. Let {Mi \u2192 M } be a collection of finite regular covers\nwith degree di .\n\n\u221a\n(1) If \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ di \u2192 0, then b1 (Mi ) > 0 for all sufficiently large i.\n\n\u221a\n(2) \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi )/ di is bounded away from zero.\n\n\u221a\n(3) If \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ 4 di \u2192 0, then Mi fibres over the circle for all sufficiently large i.\nA slightly weaker form of Theorem 1(1) appeared in [3] as Corollary 1.4, with\nessentially the same proof. It is included here in order to emphasise its connection\nto the other two results.\nThe following corollary of Theorem 1(3) gives a necessary and sufficient condition for M to be virtually fibred in terms of the Heegaard genus of its finite covers.\nWe say that a collection {Mi \u2192 M } of finite covers has bounded irregularity if\n\nthe normalisers of \u03c01 Mi in \u03c01 M have bounded index in \u03c01 M .\n\nCorollary 2. Let M be a closed orientable 3-manifold with a negatively curved\nRiemannian metric, and let {Mi \u2192 M } be its finite-sheeted covers with degree\n\ndi . Then the following are equivalent:\n\n(1) Mi is fibred for infinitely many i;\n(2) in some subsequence with bounded irregularity, \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ) is bounded;\n\u221a\n(3) in some subsequence with bounded irregularity, \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ 4 di \u2192 0.\nProof. (1) \u21d2 (2). If some finite-sheeted cover M\u0303 is fibred, then so is any finite\n\ncyclic cover Mi of M\u0303 dual to the fibre. The normaliser N (\u03c01 Mi ) of \u03c01 Mi in\n\u03c01 M contains \u03c01 M\u0303 , so [\u03c01 M : N (\u03c01 Mi )] is bounded and hence these covers have\n2\n\n\fbounded irregularity. Also, \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ) is bounded by twice the modulus of the Euler\ncharacteristic of the fibre, plus four.\n(2) \u21d2 (3). This is trivial, since di must tend to infinity.\n(3) \u21d2 (1). Since [\u03c01 M : N (\u03c01 Mi )] is bounded in this subcollection, we may\n\npass to a further subsequence where N (\u03c01 Mi ) is a fixed subgroup of \u03c01 M . Let M\u0303\n\nbe the finite-sheeted cover of M corresponding to this subgroup. Then, the covers\n{Mi \u2192 M } in this subsequence give a collection {Mi \u2192 M\u0303 } of finite regular covers\n\nsuch that \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/[\u03c01 M\u0303 : \u03c01 Mi ]1/4 \u2192 0. By Theorem 1(3), Mi is fibred for all\nsufficiently large i.\n\n2. Background material\nGeneralised Heegaard splittings\nA Heegaard splitting of a closed orientable 3-manifold can be viewed as arising\nfrom a handle structure. If one builds the manifold by starting with a single 0handle, then attaching some 1-handles, then some 2-handles and then a 3-handle,\nthe manifold obtained after attaching the 0- and 1-handles is handlebody, as is\nthe closure of its complement. Thus, the boundary of this submanifold is a Heegaard surface. Generalised Heegaard splittings arise from more general handle\nstructures: one starts with some 0-handles, then adds some 1-handles, then some\n2-handles, then 1-handles, and so on, in an alternating fashion, ending with some\n3-handles. One then considers the manifold embedded in M consisting of the 0handles and the first j batches of 1- and 2-handles. Let Fj be the boundary of\nthis manifold, but discarding any 2-sphere components that bound 0- or 3-handles.\nAfter a small isotopy, so that these surfaces are all disjoint, they divide M into\ncompression bodies. In fact, the surfaces {Fj : j odd} form Heegaard surfaces for\nS\nthe manifold M \u2212 {Fj : j even}. We term the surfaces Fj even or odd, depending\n\non the parity of j.\n\nMore details about generalised Heegaard splittings can be found in [7] and\n[6]. The following theorem summarises some of the results from [7].\nTheorem 3. From any minimal genus Heegaard surface F for a closed orientable\nirreducible 3-manifold M , other than S 3 , one can construct a generalised Heegaard\n3\n\n\fsplitting {F1 , . . . , Fn } in M with the following properties:\n1. Fj is incompressible and has no 2-sphere components, for each even j;\n2. Fj is strongly irreducible for each odd j;\n3. Fj and Fj+1 are not parallel for any j;\n4. |\u03c7(Fj )| \u2264 |\u03c7(F )| for each j;\n5. |\u03c7(F )| =\n\nP\n(\u22121)j \u03c7(Fj ).\n\nCorollary 4. Let M , F and {F1 , . . . , Fn } be as in Theorem 3. Suppose that,\nS\nin addition, M is not a lens space. Let F be the surface obtained from j Fj by\nreplacing any components that are parallel by a single component. Then\n1. |\u03c7(F )| \u2264 |\u03c7(\n\nS\n\nj\n\nFj )| < |\u03c7(F )|2 ;\n\n2. F has at most 32 |\u03c7(F )| components.\nProof. Note first that no component of\n\nS\n\nj\n\nFj is a 2-sphere. When j is even,\n\nthis is (1) of Theorem 3. The same is true when j is odd, since the odd surfaces\nform Heegaard surfaces for the complement of the even surfaces, and M is not S 3 .\nS\nHence, none of the compression bodies H in the complement of j Fj is a 3-ball.\n\nWe claim also that no H is a solid torus. For if it were, consider the com-\n\npression body to which it is adjacent. If this were a product, some even surface\nwould be compressible, contradicting (1) of Theorem 3. However, if it was not a\nproduct, then it is a solid torus, possibly with punctures. If it has no punctures,\nthen M is a lens space, contrary to assumption. If it does, then some component\nof an even surface would be a 2-sphere, again contradicting (1). This proves the\nclaim.\nWe expand (5) of Theorem 3 as follows:\n|\u03c7(F )| =\n\n\u2212\u03c7(F1 ) \u03c7(F2 ) \u2212 \u03c7(F1 ) \u03c7(F2 ) \u2212 \u03c7(F3 )\n\u2212\u03c7(Fn )\n+\n+\n+ ... +\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(\u2217)\n\nFor any compression body H, other than a 3-ball, with negative boundary \u2202\u2212 H\nand positive boundary \u2202+ H, \u03c7(\u2202\u2212 H) \u2212 \u03c7(\u2202+ H) is even and non-negative. It is\n\nzero if and only if H is a product or a solid torus. Since Fj and Fj+1 are not\nparallel for any j, each term in (\u2217) is therefore at least one. So, n + 1, the number\n4\n\n\fof terms on the right-hand side of (\u2217), is at most |\u03c7(F )|. Hence,\n[\nX\n|\u03c7( Fj )| =\n|\u03c7(Fj )| \u2264 n|\u03c7(F )| < |\u03c7(F )|2 .\nj\n\nj\n\nS\n\nThe inequality |\u03c7(F )| \u2264 |\u03c7( j Fj )| simply follows from the fact that we discard\nS\nsome components of j Fj to form F . This proves (1).\nNow it is trivial to check that, for any compression body H, other than a\n\n3-ball, solid torus or product, |\u2202H| \u2264\n\n3\n2 (\u03c7(\u2202\u2212 H)\n\n\u2212 \u03c7(\u2202+ H)). The number of\nS\ncomponents of F is half the sum, over all complementary regions H of j Fj that\n\nare not products, of |\u2202H|. This is at most 43 (\u03c7(\u2202\u2212 H) \u2212 \u03c7(\u2202+ H)). But the sum,\nS\nover all complementary regions H of j Fj , of 21 (\u03c7(\u2202\u2212 H) \u2212 \u03c7(\u2202+ H)) is the right-\n\nhand side of (\u2217). Thus, we deduce that the number of components of F is at most\n3\n|\u03c7(F )|,\n2\n\nproving (2).\n\nRealisation as minimal surfaces\nOne advantage of using generalised Heegaard splittings satisfying (1) and (2)\nof Theorem 3 is that minimal surfaces then play a r\u00f4le in the theory. The following\ntheorem of Freedman, Hass and Scott [2] applies to the even surfaces.\nTheorem 5. Let S be an orientable embedded incompressible surface in a closed\norientable irreducible Riemannian 3-manifold. Suppose that no two components\nof S are parallel, and that no component is a 2-sphere. Then there is an ambient\nisotopy of S so that afterwards each component is either a least area, minimal\nsurface or the boundary of a regular neighbourhood of an embedded, least area,\nminimal non-orientable surface.\nWe will apply the above result to the incompressible components of F . If\nwe cut M along these components, the remaining components form strongly irreducible Heegaard surfaces for the complementary regions. A theorem of Pitts and\nRubinstein [5] now applies.\nTheorem 6. Let S1 be a (possibly empty) embedded stable minimal surface in\na closed orientable irreducible Riemannian 3-manifold M with a bumpy metric.\nLet S2 be a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface for a complementary region of\nS1 . Then there is an ambient isotopy, leaving S1 fixed, taking S2 to a minimal\nsurface, or to the boundary of a regular neighbourhood of a minimal embedded\n5\n\n\fnon-orientable surface, with a tube attached that is vertical in the I-bundle structure on this neighbourhood.\nBumpy metrics were defined by White in [8]. After a small perturbation, any\nRiemannian metric can be made bumpy. Then we may ambient isotope F so that\neach component is as described in Theorems 5 and 6.\nWe will need some parts of the proof of Theorem 6, and not just its statement.\nLet X be the component of M \u2212 S1 containing S2 . Then, as a Heegaard surface,\nS2 determines a sweepout of X. In any sweepout, there is a surface of maximum\n\narea, although it need not be unique. Let a be the infimum, over all sweepouts in\nthis equivalence class, of this maximum area. Then Pitts and Rubinstein showed\nthat there is a sequence of sweepouts, whose maximal area surfaces tend to an\nembedded minimal surface, and that the area of these surfaces tends to a. This\nminimal surface, or its orientable double cover if it is non-orientable, is isotopic to\nS2 or to a surface obtained by compressing S2 .\nNow, when M is negatively curved, one may use Gauss-Bonnet to bound\nthe area of this surface. Suppose that \u03ba < 0 is the supremum of the sectional\ncurvatures of M . Then, as the surface is minimal, its sectional curvature is at\nmost \u03ba. Hence, by Gauss-Bonnet, its area is at most 2\u03c0|\u03c7(S2 )|/|\u03ba|. Thus, we have\nthe following result.\nAddendum 7. Let S1 , S2 and M be as in Theorem 6. Suppose that the sectional\ncurvature of M is at most \u03ba < 0. Then, for each \u01eb > 0, there is a sweepout of the\ncomponent of M \u2212 S1 containing S2 , equivalent to the sweepout determined by\nS2 , so that each surface in this sweepout has area at most (2\u03c0|\u03c7(S2 )|/|\u03ba|) + \u01eb.\n\nOne has a good deal of geometric control over minimal surfaces when M is\nnegatively curved. As observed above, their area is bounded in terms of their\nEuler characteristic and the supremal sectional curvature of M . In fact, by ruling\nout the existence of long thin tubes in the surface, one has the following.\nTheorem 8. There is a function f : R \u00d7 R \u2192 R with the following property. Let\n\nM be a Riemannian 3-manifold, whose injectivity radius is at least \u01eb/2 > 0, and\nwhose sectional curvature is at most \u03ba < 0. Let S be a closed minimal surface\nin M . Then there is a collection of at most f (\u03ba, \u01eb)|\u03c7(S)| points in S, such that\n\n6\n\n\fthe balls of radius f (\u03ba, \u01eb) about these points cover S. (Here, distance is measured\nusing the path metric on S.)\nThis is proved in Proposition 6.1 of [3]. More precisely, formulas (1) and (2)\nthere give the result.\nThe Cheeger constant of manifolds and graphs\nThe Cheeger constant of a compact Riemannian manifold M is defined to be\n\u001a\n\u001b\nArea(S)\nh(M ) = inf\n,\nmin{Volume(M1 ), Volume(M2 )}\nwhere S ranges over all embedded codimension one submanifolds that divide M\ninto M1 and M2 .\nA central theme of [3] is that the Cheeger constant of a 3-manifold and its\nHeegaard splittings are intimately related. One example of this phenomenon is\nthe following result.\nTheorem 9. Let M be a closed Riemannian 3-manifold. Let \u03ba < 0 be the\nsupremum of its sectional curvatures. Then\nh(M ) \u2264\n\n4\u03c0 \u03c7h\u2212 (M )\n.\n|\u03ba|Volume(M )\n\nThis is essentially Theorem 4.1 of [3]. However, there, \u03c7h\u2212 (M ) is replaced\nby c+ (M ), which is an invariant defined in terms of the generalised Heegaard\nsplittings of M . But the above inequality follows from an identical argument. We\nbriefly summarise the proof.\nFrom a minimal genus Heegaard splitting of M , construct a generalised Heegaard splitting {F1 , . . . , Fn } satisfying (1) to (5) of Theorem 3. Let F be the\nS\nsurface obtained from j Fj by discarding multiple copies of parallel components.\nApply the isotopy of Theorem 5 to the incompressible components of F . Each\n\ncomplementary region corresponds to a component of the complement of the even\nsurfaces, and therefore contains a component of some odd surface Fj . Label this\nregion with the integer j, and let Mj be the union of the regions labelled j. There\nis some odd j such that the volumes of M1 \u222a . . . \u222a Mj\u22122 and Mj+2 \u222a . . . \u222a Mn are\n\neach at most half the volume of M . Now, Fj \u2229 Mj forms a strongly irreducible\n7\n\n\fHeegaard surface for Mj . Applying Addendum 7, we find for each \u01eb > 0, a sweepout of Mj , equivalent to that determined by Fj , by surfaces with area at most\n(2\u03c0|\u03c7(Fj )|/|\u03ba|) + \u01eb. But, |\u03c7(Fj )| \u2264 \u03c7h\u2212 (M ), by (4) of Theorem 3. Some surface in\n\nthis sweepout divides M into two parts of equal volume. So, as \u01eb was arbitrary,\nh(M ) \u2264\n\n4\u03c0 \u03c7h\u2212 (M )\n.\n|\u03ba|Volume(M )\n\nIn this paper, we will consider the Cheeger constants of regular finite-sheeted\ncovering spaces Mi of M . Here, Mi is given the Riemannian metric lifted from\nM . It is possible to estimate h(Mi ) in terms of graph-theoretic data, as follows.\nBy analogy with the Cheeger constant for a Riemannian manifold, one can\ndefine the Cheeger constant h(X) of a finite graph X. If A is a subset of the vertex\nset V (X), \u2202A denotes those edges with precisely one endpoint in A. Then h(X)\nis defined to be\ninf\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n|\u2202A|\n: A \u2282 V (X) and 0 < |A| \u2264 |V (X)|/2 .\n|A|\n\nProposition 10. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. Let X be a finite\n\nset of generators for \u03c01 M . Then there is a constant k1 \u2265 1 with the following\n\nproperty. If Xi is the Cayley graph of \u03c01 M/\u03c01 Mi with respect to the generators\n\nX , then\n\nk1\u22121 h(Xi ) \u2264 h(Mi ) \u2264 k1 h(Xi ).\n\nThis is essentially contained in [1], but we outline a proof. Lemma 2.3 of [3]\nstates that, if X and X \u2032 are two finite sets of generators for \u03c01 M , then there is a\n\nconstant k \u2265 1 with the following property. If Xi and Xi\u2032 are the Cayley graphs\n\nof \u03c01 M/\u03c01 Mi with respect to X and X \u2032 , then\n\nk \u22121 h(Xi ) \u2264 h(Xi\u2032 ) \u2264 k h(Xi ).\nThus, for the purposes of proving Proposition 10, we are free to choose X . We do\n\nthis as follows. We pick a connected fundamental domain in the universal cover\n\nof M . The translates of this domain to which it is adjacent correspond to a finite\nset X of generators for \u03c01 M . There is an induced fundamental domain in any\n8\n\n\ffinite regular cover Mi of M . Its translates are in one-one correspondence with\nthe group \u03c01 M/\u03c01 Mi . Two translates are adjacent if and only if one is obtained\nfrom the other by right-multiplication by an element in X . Thus, the Cayley\n\ngraph Xi should be viewed as a coarse approximation to Mi . Any subset A of\n\nV (Xi ), as in the definition of h(Xi ), therefore determines a decomposition of Mi .\nAfter a further modification, we may assume that this is along a codimension one\nsubmanifold. The existence of a constant k1 such that h(Mi ) \u2264 k1 h(Xi ) is then\nclear. The other inequality is more difficult to establish. One needs to control the\n\ngeometry of a codimension one submanifold S in Mi that is arbitrarily close to\nrealising the Cheeger constant of Mi . This is achieved in the proof of Lemma 2 of\n[1].\nConstructing non-trivial cocycles\nSome new machinery has been developed in [3] that gives necessary and sufficient conditions on a finitely presented group to have finite index subgroups with\ninfinite abelianisation. We describe some of the ideas behind this now.\nLet C be a finite cell complex with a single 0-cell and in which every 2-cell is\na triangle. Let G be its fundamental group, and let X be the generators arising\n\nfrom the 1-cells. Associated with any finite index normal subgroup Hi of G, there\nis a finite-sheeted covering space Ci of C. Its 1-skeleton Xi is the Cayley graph of\nG/Hi with respect to X . The following theorem is an expanded form of Lemma\n\n2.4 of [3] and has exactly the same proof. It will play a key r\u00f4le in this paper.\np\nTheorem 11. Suppose that h(Xi ) < 2/(3|V (Xi )|). Let A be any non-empty\n\nsubset of V (Xi ) such that |\u2202A|/|A| = h(Xi ) and |A| \u2264 |V (Xi )|/2. Then there\n\nis a 1-cocycle c on Ci that is not a coboundary. Its support is a subset of the\n\nedges of \u2202A, and it takes values in {\u22121, 0, 1}. As a consequence, Hi has infinite\nabelianisation.\n\n3. The proof of the main theorem\nWe start with a closed orientable 3-manifold M admitting a negatively curved\nRiemannian metric. After a small perturbation, we may assume that the metric\nis bumpy. Let \u03ba < 0 be the supremum of its sectional curvatures. Pick a 1-vertex\n9\n\n\ftriangulation T of M . The edges of T , when oriented in some way, form a set X\nof generators for \u03c01 (M ). Let K be the 2-skeleton of the complex dual to T .\n\nWe will consider a collection {Mi \u2192 M } of finite regular covers of M , hav-\n\ning the properties of Theorem 1. In particular, we will assume (at least) that\n\u221a\n\u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ di \u2192 0. (Note that this is justified when proving Theorem 1(2), by\npassing to a subsequence, and using the fact that \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ) \u2264 \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi ).) The triangulation T and 2-complex K lift to Ti and Ki , say, in Mi . The 1-skeleton of Ti\nforms the Cayley graph Xi of Gi = \u03c01 M/\u03c01 Mi with respect to X .\nAccording to Theorem 9,\nh(Mi ) \u2264\n\n\u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )\n4\u03c0 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )\n4\u03c0\n=\n,\n|\u03ba| Volume(Mi )\n|\u03ba|Volume(M ) di\n\nBy Proposition 10, there is a constant k1 \u2265 1 independent of i such that h(Xi ) \u2264\nk1 h(Mi ). Setting\n\nk2 =\nwe deduce that\n\n4\u03c0k1\n,\n|\u03ba|Volume(M )\n\nh(Xi ) \u2264 k2\n\n\u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )\n.\ndi\n\nLet V (Xi ) be the vertex set of Xi . Let A be a non-empty subset of V (Xi )\nsuch that |\u2202A|/|A| = h(Xi ) and |A| \u2264 |V (Xi )|/2 = di /2. By Theorem 11, when\np\n2/(3di), Ti admits a 1-cocycle c that is not a coboundary. Since\nh(Xi ) <\n\u221a\nh(Xi ) \u2264 k2 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/di , and we are assuming (at least) that \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ di \u2192 0,\n\nthen such a cocycle exists for all sufficiently large i. This establishes (1) of the\nTheorem 1.\nTheorem 11 states that c takes values in {\u22121, 0, 1}, and its support is a subset\n\nof the edges of \u2202A. Dual to this cocycle is a transversely oriented normal surface\nS in Ti which is homologically non-trivial. Remove any 2-sphere components from\nS. This is still homologically non-trivial, since all 2-spheres in Mi are inessential,\nas Mi is negatively curved. The intersection of S with the 2-skeleton of Ti is a\ngraph in S whose complementary regions are triangles and squares. Let V (S) and\nE(S) be its vertices and edges. Its vertices are in one-one correspondence with\nthe edges of Ti in the support of c. So,\n|V (S)| \u2264 |\u2202A| = |A|h(Xi ) \u2264 di h(Xi )/2 \u2264 k2 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/2.\n10\n\n\fThe valence of each vertex is at most the maximal valence of an edge in T , k3 ,\nsay. So,\n|\u03c7(S)| < |E(S)| \u2264 |V (S)|k3 /2 \u2264 k2 k3 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/4.\nSetting k4 = k2 k3 /4, we have deduced the existence of a homologically non-trivial,\ntransversely oriented, properly embedded surface S with |\u03c7(S)| \u2264 k4 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ) and\n\nwith no 2-sphere components. By compressing S and removing components if\nnecessary, we may assume that S is also incompressible and connected. Thus, we\nhave proved the following result.\n\nTheorem 12. Let M be a closed orientable 3-manifold with a negatively curved\nRiemannian metric. Then there is a constant k4 > 0 with the following property. Let {Mi \u2192 M } be a collection of finite regular covers, with degree di . If\n\u221a\n\u03c7h\u2212 (Mi )/ di \u2192 0, then, for all sufficiently large i, Mi contains an embedded,\n\nconnected, oriented, incompressible, homologically non-trivial surface S such that\n|\u03c7(S)| \u2264 k4 \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ).\n\nBy a theorem of Freedman, Hass and Scott [2] (Theorem 5 in this paper), there\nis an ambient isotopy taking S to a minimal surface. We therefore investigate the\ncoarse geometry of minimal surfaces in Mi .\nSet \u01eb/2 to be the injectivity radius of M . Let f (\u03ba, \u01eb) be the function from\nTheorem 8. Let K\u0303 be the lift of the 2-complex K to the universal cover of M .\nLet k5 be the maximum number of complementary regions of K\u0303 that lie within a\ndistance f (\u03ba, \u01eb) of any point, and let k6 = f (\u03ba, \u01eb)k5.\nLemma 13. Let S be a minimal surface in Mi . Then S intersects at most k6 |\u03c7(S)|\n\ncomplementary regions of Ki . Hence, running through any such region, there are\nat most k6 |\u03c7(S)| translates of S under the covering group action of Gi .\nProof. By Theorem 8, the number of balls of radius f (\u03ba, \u01eb) required to cover\nS is at most f (\u03ba, \u01eb)|\u03c7(S)|. The centre of each of these balls has at most k5\ncomplementary regions of Ki within a distance f (\u03ba, \u01eb). So, S intersects at most\nk6 |\u03c7(S)| complementary regions of Ki . Each such region corresponds to an element\n\nof Gi . To prove the second half of the lemma, we may concentrate on the region\ncorresponding to the identity. Then a translate gS runs through here, for some g\nin Gi , if and only if S runs through the region corresponding to g \u22121 . Thus, there\ncan be at most k6 |\u03c7(S)| such g.\n11\n\n\fProof of Theorem 1(2). Let F be a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface in Mi\nwith |\u03c7(F )| = \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi ). By Theorem 6, there is an ambient isotopy taking it either\n\nto a minimal surface or to the double cover of a minimal non-orientable surface,\nwith a small tube attached. So, by Lemma 13, F intersects at most k6 \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi )\ncomplementary regions of Ki . Hence, by Lemma 13, the number of copies of S\nh\nthat F intersects is at most (k6 \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi ))(k6 k4 \u03c7\u2212 (Mi )). This is less than di if\n\u221a\n\u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi )/ di is sufficiently small. So there is a translate of S which misses F . It\n\nthen lies in a complementary handlebody of F . But this is impossible, since S is\n\u221a\nincompressible. So, \u03c7sh\n\u2212 (Mi )/ di is bounded away from zero.\nProof of Theorem 1(3). For ease of notation, let x = \u03c7h\u2212 (Mi ). Let {F1 , . . . , Fn }\n\nbe a generalised Heegaard splitting for Mi , satisfying (1) - (5) of Theorem 3,\n\nobtained from a minimal genus Heegaard splitting. Replace any components of\nF1 \u222a . . . \u222a Fn that are parallel by a single component, and let F be the resulting\n\nsurface. Isotope F so that each component is as in Theorems 5 or 6. Corollary 4\n\nstates that |\u03c7(F )| < x2 . By Lemma 13, the number of complementary regions of\n\nKi that can intersect F is at most k6 x2 . Let D be the corresponding subset of Gi .\nSimilarly, let C be the subset of Gi that corresponds to those complementary\nregions of Ki which intersect S. By Lemma 13, |C| \u2264 k6 |\u03c7(S)| \u2264 k6 k4 x.\nWe claim that, when i is sufficiently large, there are at least 9x/2 disjoint\ntranslates of S under Gi that are also disjoint from F . Let m = 9x/2. If the claim\nis not true, then for any m-tuple (g1 S, . . . , gm S) of copies of S (where gj \u2208 Gi\n\nfor each j), either at least two intersect or one copy intersects F . In the former\n\ncase, gj c1 = gk c2 , for some c1 and c2 in C, and for 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 m. Hence,\n\ngk\u22121 gj \u2208 CC \u22121 . In the latter case, gj c1 = d for some c1 in C and d in D, and so\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(CC \u22121 ) and p\u22121\n) cover (Gi )m , where qjk\ngj \u2208 DC \u22121 . Thus, the sets qjk\nj (DC\n\nand pj are the maps\n\nqjk : (Gi )m \u2192 Gi\n(g1 , . . . , gm ) 7\u2192 gk\u22121 gj\npj : (Gi )m \u2192 Gi\n(g1 , . . . , gm ) 7\u2192 gj ,\n\u22121\nfor 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 m. The former sets qjk\n(CC \u22121 ) each have size |Gi |m\u22121 |CC \u22121 |,\n\n12\n\n\f\u22121\nand the latter sets p\u22121\n) have size |Gi |m\u22121 |DC \u22121 |. So,\nj (DC\n\n|Gi |m \u2264\n\n\u0010m\u0011\n2\n\n|Gi |m\u22121 |C|2 + m|Gi |m\u22121 |C||D|.\n\nThis implies that\ndi = |Gi | \u2264\n\n\u0010m\u0011\n2\n\n(k6 k4 x)2 + m(k6 k4 x)(k6 x2 ).\n\n\u221a\nThe right-hand side has order x4 as i \u2192 \u221e. However, x/ 4 di \u2192 0, which is a\ncontradiction, proving the claim.\n\nConsider these 9x/2 copies of S. Each lies in the complement of F , which is\na collection of compression bodies. Since S is incompressible and connected, each\ncopy of S must be parallel to a component of F . By Corollary 4(2), F has at most\n3x/2 components. So, at least 3 copies of S are parallel, and at least 2 of these\nare coherently oriented. The proof is now completed by the following lemma.\nLemma 14. Let S be a connected, embedded, oriented, incompressible, nonseparating surface in a closed orientable 3-manifold Mi . Suppose that the image\nof S under some finite order orientation-preserving homeomorphism h of Mi is\ndisjoint from S, parallel to it and coherently oriented. Then Mi fibres over the\ncircle with fibre S.\nProof. Let Y be the manifold lying between S and h(S). It is copy of S \u00d7 I, with\n\nS and h(S) corresponding to S \u00d7 {0} and S \u00d7 {1}. Take a countable collection\n\n{Yn : n \u2208 Z} of copies of this manifold. Glue S \u00d7 {1} in Yn to S \u00d7 {0} in Yn+1 ,\n\nvia h\u22121 . The resulting space Y\u221e is a copy of S \u00d7 R. Let H be the automorphism\n\nof this space taking Yn to Yn+1 for each n, via the 'identity'. Let p: Y0 \u2192 Y be\n\nthe identification homeomorphism. Extend this to a map p: Y\u221e \u2192 Mi by defining\n\np|Yn to be hn pH \u2212n .\n\nWe claim that this is a covering map. It may expressed as a composition\nY\u221e \u2192 Y\u221e /hH N i \u2192 Mi , where N is the order of h. The first of these maps is\n\nobviously a covering map. The second is also, since it is a local homeomorphism\nand Y\u221e /hH N i is compact. Hence, p is a covering map.\nBy construction, hn (S) lifts homeomorphically to Yn\u22121 \u2229 Yn , for each n.\n\nHence, the inverse image of S in Y\u221e includes all translates of Y\u22121 \u2229 Y0 under\n13\n\n\fhH N i. These translates divide Y\u221e into copies of S \u00d7 I. Since p\u22121 (S) is incom-\n\npressible and any closed embedded incompressible surface in S \u00d7 I is horizontal,\n\nwe deduce that p\u22121 (S) divides Y\u221e into a collection of copies of S \u00d7 I. The re-\n\nstriction of p to one of these components Z is a covering map to a component of\n\nMi \u2212 S. But Mi \u2212 S is connected, as S is connected and non-separating. So, p\n\nmaps Z surjectively onto Mi \u2212 S. By examining this map near S, we see that it is\n\ndegree one and hence a homeomorphism. Therefore, Mi is obtained from a copy\nof S \u00d7 I by gluing its boundary components homeomorphically. So, Mi fibres over\n\nthe circle with fibre S.\n\nReferences\n1. R.
