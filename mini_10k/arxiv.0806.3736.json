To allow for accurate total electron yield measurements, the material\nhas been grown in thin film form on a metallic substrate in order to avoid charging problems usually\nencountered during electron spectroscopic studies on bulk CoO samples. The changes in spectra\ndue to temperature are in good agreement with detailed ligand-field calculations indicating that\nthese changes are mostly due to thermal population of closely lying excited states, originating from\ndegenerate t2g levels lifted by the spin-orbit coupling. Magnetic coupling in the ordered phase,\nmodeled as a mean-field exchange field, mixes in excited states inducing a tetragonal charge density.\nThe spin-orbit coupling induced splitting of the low energy states results in a non-trivial temperature\ndependence for the magnetic susceptibility.\nPACS numbers: 71.70.Ej, 75.10.Dg, 78.70.Dm\n\nIt is an observation that many insulating 3d transition\nmetal compounds do not reveal orbital degrees of freedom in their electronic structure despite the incomplete\nfilling of the 3d shell. This is related to the fact that the\nsymmetry of the crystal often becomes so low that the\ndegeneracy of orbitals is effectively lifted. This could be\nseen as a consequence of the Jahn-Teller theorem stating that: \"when the orbital state of an ion is degenerate\nfor symmetry reasons, the ligands will experience forces\ndistorting the nuclear framework until the ion assumes a\nconfiguration both of lower symmetry and of lower energy, thereby resolving the degeneracy\".1,2 Nevertheless,\nfor some compounds, with CoO and FeO as well known\nexamples, a (nearly) cubic structure exists although these\nsystems have a partially filled t2g sub-shell. In such cases\nthe orbital degeneracy can be lifted by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This in turn leads to quite interesting local\nphysics, not only because of the formation of orbital moments and large magnetocrystalline anisotropies, but also\nbecause of a strong temperature dependence in the local\nmagnetic properties as we will address below.\nTaking the case of CoO, we will describe its ground\nstate and low-energy local excitations using the theoretical frame work laid out by Kanamori3 and Goodenough4 .\nThe Co ions in this material are divalent and have 7 electrons in the 3d shell. Due to electron-electron interactions, a Hunds-rule S = 3/2 high-spin ground-state is realized, with an electronic configuration of approximately\nt52g e2g .5 The single hole in the t2g shell can be in three\ndifferent orbitals, normally denoted as an xy, xz, or yz\norbital. With the SOC being present, one should consider\nmaking complex linear combinations of these orbitals like\np\n1/2(\u2212xz \u2212 \u0131yz) that carry an orbital momentum of 1\n\u03bcB in the z direction.6 Orbital momentum in the x or\ny direction can be created by cyclic permutation of the\n\ncoordinates. One can therefore assign to each t2g electron a pseudo orbital momentum of  \u0303l = 1 (note that it\nis still a d electron so l = 2.)3,4,7 For CoO this results in\na total pseudo orbital momentum of L\u0303 = 1. This orbital\nmomentum couples with the spin S = 3/2 to a state with\nJ \u0303 = 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2. The doublet with J \u0303 = 1/2 is the\nground-state, with the quartet about 40 meV higher and\nthe sextet about 120 meV higher than the ground-state.\nFurthermore, the sextet is split by the cubic crystal field\ninto a quartet and doublet. In estimating the numbers\nwe have used a SOC constant of \u03b6 = 66 meV from atomic\nHartree-Fock calculations.8,9\nExperimentally one could measure these excitations\nwith the use of inelastic neutron scattering. The interpretation is somewhat complicated as one measures\nphonons, magnons and spin-orbit excitations all at the\nsame time, but satisfying results have been obtained.10,11\nYet, it would be welcome to have an alternative spectroscopic method with perhaps also advantages in terms of\nelement specificity in case one is dealing with a multicomponent materials, or higher material sensitivity for,\ne.g., thin films. In this regard it has been recognized that\nsoft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) should have the\npotential to reveal the presence of those excited states:\nTanaka and Jo,12 and De Groot13 have calculated that\ntheoretically one should see a strong temperature dependence in the XAS lineshape. In such an XAS process,\nthe soft-x-ray photon (770-800 eV) is used to promote\na 2p Co core electron into the 3d valence shell. This\ntransition is subject to strict dipole selection rules, e.g.\n\u2206J = 0, \u00b11 in spherical symmetry, with the result that\neach particular initial state has its own set of reachable final states. It turned out that the differences between the\nsets of final states are appreciable when the differences in\nthe initial states can be traced back to differences in the\n\n\fIntensity (arb. units)\n\n2\n\n~\nJ=5/2\n\n~\nJ=3/2\n\n~\nJ=1/2\n775\n\n780\n\n785\n790\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\n795\n\n800\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Theoretical isotropic Co-L2,3 XAS spectra for the different initial states split by spin-orbit coupling\nas present in CoO.\n\nquantum number J. In cubic symmetry as for CoO, J\nis not a good quantum number, but following analogous\narguments each initial state with a different J \u0303 will have\na different spectrum.\nIn Fig. 1 we have plotted the isotropic Co-L2,3 XAS\nspectra calculated for each initial state having a different\n \u0303 Here we used the successful configuration interaction\nJ.\nmodel that includes the full atomic multiplet theory and\nthe hybridization with the O 2p ligands.13,14 We have carried out the calculations for the Co2+ ion in the CoO6\noctahedral cluster using the XTLS8.3 program14 with parameter values typical for a Co2+ system.15 The spectra\nare dominated by the Co 2p core-hole spin-orbit coupling\nwhich splits them roughly in two parts, namely the L3\n(h\u03bd \u2248 779 eV) and L2 (h\u03bd \u2248 794 eV) white lines regions. The curves in Fig. 1 reproduce the main results\nof Tanaka and Jo,12 and De Groot.13 We have not separately shown the two spectra for the doublet and quartet\nstates originating from the J \u0303 = 5/2 but combined them.\nThe energy splitting between these two set of states is\nsmall enough compared to the energy difference between\nthe ground-state and the center of the J \u0303 = 5/2 states so\nthat this splitting is of no real importance if the states\nare to be populated by temperature. These calculations\nshow that the differences are so large that an experimental resolution of order several 100 meV would be more\nthan sufficient to discriminate the various initial states\ndiffering 100 meV or less in energy. Important is only\nthe temperature and the statistics with which the spec-\n\ntra have to be measured.\nNevertheless, it is rather surprising that to the best of\nour knowledge no experimental data have been reported\nin the literature so far to confirm the validity of the calculations, i.e. 14-17 years after the appearance of Tanaka\nand Jo12 and De Groot13 studies. Indeed, it turned out to\nbe difficult to obtain reliable XAS data of CoO. Standard\nmethods to measure the XAS signal failed so far: the total electron yield (TEY) method cannot be applied since\nCoO is strongly charging at low temperatures, and the\nfluorescence yield (FY) method suffers from too strong\nself-absorption effects,16 causing severe distortions in the\nspectral line shapes. We therefore have set out to prepare CoO in thin film form on metallic substrates, thin\nenough as to avoid charging problems upon measurement\nusing the TEY method and yet thick enough to essentially retain the properties of bulk CoO. The thin film\nmust also be polycrystalline, as to avoid complications\ncaused by the occurrence of (magnetic) linear dichroism\neffects.17,18,19\nThe XAS measurements were performed at the Dragon\nbeamline of the NSRRC in Taiwan. The spectra were\nrecorded using the total electron yield method in a chamber with a base pressure of 3\u00d710\u221210 mbar. The photon\nenergy resolution at the Co L2,3 edges (h\u03bd \u2248 770 \u2212 800\neV) was set at 0.3 eV. The actual polycrystalline CoO\nthin film was grown in-situ on a polycrystalline Ag sample by means of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), i.e.\nevaporating elemental and Co from alumina crucibles in\na pure oxygen atmosphere of 10\u22127 to 10\u22126 mbar. The\nbase pressure of the MBE system is in the low 10\u221210 mbar\nrange. The thickness of the film was about 90 \u0226 as determined using a quartz-balance monitor, which in turn\nwas calibrated using the time period of the oscillation in\nthe intensity of reflection high energy electron diffraction\n(RHEED) pattern of CoO thin films epitaxially grown\non Ag(001).19,20 From that single crystal work we also\nknow that a 90 \u0226 CoO film has a N\u00e9el temperature of\nabout 290 K, i.e. essentially identical to the 291 K value\ndetermined for the bulk material.22 The polycrystalline\nCoO thin film has been measured at normal incidence\nwith a beam-spot size of about 1 mm2 . Homogeneity of\nthe thin film has been verified by measuring at several\ndifferent positions on the thin film resulting in negligible\ndifferences of the spectra.\nFig. 2 shows the Co-L2,3 XAS spectra of the polycrystalline CoO thin film taken at various temperatures\nbetween 77 K and 400 K. The general line shape of the\nspectra shows the characteristic features very similar to\nthat of bulk CoO13 , verifying the good quality of our\nCoO film. The low-temperature spectra have been measured before and after heating to 400 K showing no detectable changes demonstrating the chemical stability of\nthe sample. Important is that high quality spectra can\nbe obtained for all temperatures, and this without the\nslightest indication for a reduction of the intensity for\nthe lower temperature spectra, demonstrating that our\nthin film approach is a successful resolution against the\n\n\fIntensity (arb. units)\n\n3\n\n77K\n100K\n150K\n200K\n300K\n400K\n\n2.5\n2.5\n775\n\nL3\n780\n\nL2\n785\n790\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\n795\n\n800\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Experimental Co-L2,3 XAS spectra of\npolycrystalline CoO thin film taken at various temperatures\nbetween 77 K and 400K.\n\n77K\n100K\n150K\n200K\n300K\n400K\n\n2.5\n2.5\n775\n\nL3\n780\n\nL2\n785\n790\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\n795\n\n800\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Theoretical Co-L2,3 XAS spectra of\nCoO at several temperatures. Temperature dependence is due\nto population of excited states according to Bolzman statistics. Non-cubic distortions and magnetic correlations have\nbeen neglected.\n\ncharging problems often encountered when working with\nCoO.\nA closer look at the experimental spectra in Fig. 2\nreveals that there is a small but systematic change in\nthe line shape with temperature. A blow-up of the spectra in the L2 edge range makes this even clearer. To\nunderstand this temperature dependence quantitatively,\nwe simulated the spectra by summing up the theoretical spectra starting from the different excited states (see\nFig. 1), weighted by their thermal population according\nto the Boltzman statistics. These theoretical results are\nplotted in Fig. 3, and one can observe a very good agreement with the experiment. The predictions by Tanaka\nand Jo12 and De Groot13 are thus confirmed.\nThe calculations in Fig. 3 are done in cubic symmetry neglecting magnetic ordering. It is well known that\nCoO undergoes an anti-ferromagnetic ordering at 291 K.\nThis phase transition is accompanied by a tetragonal distortion and smaller distortions to even lower symmetry.\n\nTanaka and Jo12 have shown that the non-cubic distortions (and the exchange field) can mix the low-energy\nstates with different t2g orbital occupation, split by spinorbit coupling, thereby changing the lineshape of the\nspectra. As the magnetic correlations and the tetragonal distortion are temperature dependent this could also\nresult in a temperature dependence of the spectra. We\nwill show below that the inclusion of these effects will\neven improve the already very good agreement between\nthe temperature dependent theoretical and experimental\nCo L2,3 spectra as shown in Fig. 3.\nIn the top panels of Fig. 4 we show the energy level\ndiagram of the lowest 12 eigen-states of a CoO10\u2212\nclus6\nter as a function of exchange field (left) and tetragonal\nsplitting between the dxy and dxz/yz orbital (right). The\ninset shows the t2g hole density. For cubic symmetry\nthe ground-state is a Kramer's-doublet, which has a cubic charge density. For both an exchange field (in the\nz direction) and a tetragonal contraction of one Co-O\nbond, the dxy orbital becomes more occupied and the\nhole resides in a complex linear combination of the dxz\nand dyz orbital carrying an orbital momentum parallel\nto the spin of that hole. The bottom panels of Fig. 4\nshow the changes of spectra (at 0 K) as a function of\nthese non cubic distortions. One can clearly see small\nchanges in the spectra. The line-shape of the changes due\nto quantum mechanical mixing of the excited states into\nthe ground-state are rather similar to the changes caused\nby thermal population. This leads to a compensating effect: in going from low to high temperatures, one has a\nreduction of the exchange field and tetragonal splitting\n(they eventually disappear above the N\u00e9el temperature),\nand thus changes in a direction opposite as those caused\nby the thermal population effect. The temperature dependence in the experimental spectrum is thus a result\nof the thermal population of excited states as shown in\nFig. 3, slightly reduced in its magnitude by quantum\nmechanical mixing of the excited states into the groundstate at low temperatures as shown in Fig. 4. Indeed, a\ndetailed comparison between Figs. 2 and 3 reveal that\nthe theoretical spectra show too much change with temperature, and the inclusion of those quantum mechanical\nmixing effects from Fig. 4 will improve the agreement\neven more.\nThe presence of the SOC has obviously important consequences for the ground state and the magnetic properties of the Co ion. The SOC lifts the orbital degeneracy\nand the ground-state (without magnetic interactions) becomes a Kramers doublet with an effective J \u0303 = 1/2. One\nshould note that this Kramers doublet is not Jahn-Teller\nactive, that it has a cubic charge density and does not\nshow linear dichroism. This Kramers doublet has a magnetic moment, as revealed by the cluster calculations of\nLz = \u22120.56~ and Sz = \u22120.79~ (Mz = 2.15\u03bcB , g = 4.29,\nand \u03bc2eff = 3.72 \u03bc2B ). The induced Van Vleck moment is\n0.018\u03bcB per Tesla. Exchange fields and crystal distortions mix in excited states, thereby altering the expectation value of the magnetic moment.

Bottom panels: Theoretical\nCo-L2,3 XAS spectra of CoO as a function of exchange fields (left) and tetragonal crystal field distortion (right).\n\nthese distortions induce a non-cubic local charge density\nand create linear dichroism. In order to calculate the low\ntemperature ordered moments we need to make an estimate for the exchange field and tetragonal distortion.\nCoO has a 1.2% tetragonal contraction at low T.21 If\nwe interpolate the values for the crystal-field and the exchange field as found for CoO thin films grown on MnO\nand Ag19 we find an exchange field of 12.6 meV and a\ntetragonal distortion of 25 meV between the dxy and the\ndxz/yz orbital. With these values we find for the groundstate that the total magnetic moments are Sz = \u22121.14~\nand Lz = \u22121.15~ (Mz = 3.44\u03bcB ).\nThe SOC induced splitting of the low lying states has\nalso important consequences for the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, in an analogous\nmanner as it causes the temperature dependence of the\nXAS spectra. We have calculated the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 = limH\u21920 \u2202M/\u2202H (which is equal to M/H for\nH small enough), for a CoO610\u2212 cluster. In Fig. 5a we\nshow the the susceptibility calculated for the entire cluster including all Van Vleck moments (dotted line) and\nthe susceptibility calculated for the lowest 12 eigenstates\n(straight line). For the second calculation we have thus\nneglected the Van Vleck (and Curie) susceptibility induced by the higher lying states, such as found around 1\neV involving a t2g -eg orbital excitation. This roughly corresponds to experimentally subtracting a constant from\nthe measured susceptibility such that the high temperature limit goes to zero. Panel b of Fig. 5 shows 1/\u03c7\nagainst the temperature. One can observe that the curve\n\ndoes not follow a linear behavior in a large temperature\nregime. There are two limiting cases of interest. For\nkB T much smaller then the energy of the first excited\nstate one should expect normal Curie-Weiss behaviour.\nThis asymptote is indicated in Fig. 5b by a straight line\non the left (blue). The other limit would be when kB T is\nmuch larger then the highest energy of the excited states\nsplit by SOC. In this limit one would again expect to retrieve a 're-normalized' Curie-Weiss like behavior. This\nlimit is indicated in Fig. 5b by a straight line on the\nright hand side (red). One can see that for temperatures\nstarting roughly at 600 K 1/\u03c7 shows linear behaviour and\nthe high temperature limit is reasonably achieved. One\nmight naively think that the high temperature region can\nbe used to extract magnetic quantum numbers as it is often done when a Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed,\nbut then one must also realize that those numbers are\nnot representative for the ground state.\nTo illustrate this more clearly, we will discuss both\nlimits in more detail. We start with the low temperature\nlimit. In Fig. 5c we plot \u03bc2eff , the (apparent) effective\nmagnetic moment squared (\u03bc2eff is defined here as 3kB\ndivided by the temperature derivative of 1/\u03c7(T )). In\nthe low temperature limit \u03bc2eff does not become a constant as one should expect for Curie-Weiss behaviour\nas we did not subtract the Van Vleck moments for the\nground-state doublet. (The straight line is calculated\nfor a subtraction of the Van Vleck moments for the lowest 12 states, which still allows the ground-state doublet to have a positive Van Vleck moment and the ex-\n\n\f5\n\n~\nJ=3/2\n\n~\nJ=5/2\n\nmoment squared is just the average of the effective\nmoments squared of each excited stated, weighted by\nPN\nPN\n8\ntheir multiplicity: \u03bc2N = i=1 \u03bdi \u03bc2i / i=1 \u03bdi . Here \u03bc2N\nis the high temperature limit for the average effective\n6\nmoment squared of the first N non-degenerate sets of\n4\neigenstates, \u03bc2i the effective moment squared of the i-th\n2\nnon-degenerate set of eigenstates and \u03bdi the degeneracy\nof the i-th set of eigenstates. For a cluster calculation\n0\nof Co2+ one finds a high temperature effective moment\nb\nof \u03bc2eff = 4.42 \u03bc2B while the ground state value is 3.72 \u03bc2B .\n0.6\nOne does not only find a deviation from the ground-state\neffective moment but the high temperature limit also\ninduces an apparent Weiss temperature. The Weiss tem0.4\nperature \u0398 is defined here as the intercept of the tangent\nto the 1/\u03c7(T ) curve with the abscissa. This can be calcu0.2\nlated \u0010\nby making a series expansion of 1/\u03c7 in 1/T . \u0398N\u0011=\nPN\nPN\nPN\nPN\n2\n2\n1/kB\ni=1 \u03bdi \u2212\ni=1 \u03bdi \u2206i \u03bci /\ni=1 \u03bdi \u03bci ,\ni=1 \u03bdi \u2206i /\n0.0\nwith \u2206i the energy of the i-th set of eigenstates. In panel\nc\nd\nof Fig. 5 we plot the apparent Weiss temperature as a\n30\nfunction of T. One can see a strong temperature dependence and the Weiss temperature slowly saturates at 242\n20\nK. This apparent Weiss temperature has nothing to do\n10\nwith magnetic correlations since they were not included\nin this single ion calculation. Instead, the strongly\n0\nvarying (apparent) Weiss temperature merely reflects\nd\nthe fact that there are excited states with different\n150\nmagnetic quantum numbers thermally populated.\nQ( )=242 K\n100\nInterestingly one finds that the high temperature limit\n50\nfor the (apparent) effective moment squared is reached\n0\nat temperatures much lower then the energy of the highest excited state. We have added vertical bars at the\n-50\nof the excited states in Fig. 5 and one can see\n0\n1500\n2000 energies\n500\n1000\nthat \u03bc2eff becomes reasonable constant at a temperature\nT (K)\nthat is about half the energy of the highest excited state.\nNot only does one find that the high temperature regime\nFIG. 5: (color online) Calculated magnetic susceptibility and\n2+\nfor \u03bc2eff starts at rather low temperatures, one also finds\nits derivatives for a single Co ion in cubic ligand field symthat the low temperature region, where the ground-state\nmetry.
