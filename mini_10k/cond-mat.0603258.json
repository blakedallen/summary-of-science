Prominent\nexamples for such multiferroics may be found among\nCr-based spinels2? , the kagom\u00e9 staircase compound\nNi3 V2 O8 4 , rare earth manganites like hexagonal YMnO3\nand HoMnO3 5,6 , orthorombic TbMn2 O5 7 , or finally perovskites like TbMnO3 .8\nIn this latter class of heavy rare earth compounds\nRMnO3 (R = Gd, Tb, Dy)9,10 finite ferroelectric polarization is induced due to the partial frustration and\ncorresponding long range modulation of the magnetic\nstructure. The importance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction for the occurrence of ferroelectricity in noncollinear magnets has been pointed out recently.11,12,13\nStarting from the lanthanide manganite with the perovskite tolerance factor close to unity, the substitution\nof La at the A-sites by rare-earth elements with smaller\nionic radii (from Pr to Ho) leads to a successive increase of the orthorombic distortion, accompanied by a\ndecrease of the Mn-O-Mn bond angles and an increase of\nthe buckling and tilting angles of the MnO6 -octahedra,\nrespectively.9 Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction and\nthe refinement of the oxygen positions, this angle has recently been determined for the complete series of pure\nrare-earth manganites.8 Equivalent results can be obtained when continuously replacing La3+ by smaller ions\nlike in La1\u2212y Gdy MnO3 .14 The enhanced tilting of the\nMnO6 -octahedra leads to an increasing importance of\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) next-nearest neighbor interactions competing with the nearest neighbor superexchange\nwithin the ferromagnetic (FM) ab-planes of the A-type\nAFM structure. This weakening of the effective magnetic\n\ninteraction promotes a tendency towards frustration and\ncomplex spin-states.15 Hence, the transition temperature\ninto the A-type AFM phase is not only reduced, but for\nthe heavy rare earth compounds with smaller ionic radii\nan incommensurate magnetic structure is established for\ntemperatures below TN \u2248 50 K.14,15 Within these incommensurate magnetic phases, magnetoelectric coupling via\nlong-range modulation of the magnetic structure leads to\nthe loss of inversion symmetry and the onset of ferroelectric polarization.16 The onset of ferroelectricity is connected with the change of the magnetic structure from a\nsinusoidal to a helicoidal modulation.16,17 Very recently\nexcitations of the multiferroic state have been observed\nexperimentally.18 These new collective modes, which are\nresponsible for ferroelectricity, but are of magnetic origin,\nhave also been described theoretically.19 The existence of\na ferroelectric lattice distortion is especially remarkable\ndue to the fact that these compounds possess a quite\nrobust Jahn-Teller (JT) type orbital order, which sets\nin at temperatures well above 1000 K. From a principal\npoint of view Jahn-Teller active orbital degrees of freedom are the \"natural enemy\" of off-center ferroelectric\ndistortions.20 Undistorted orbital electron-density distributions are point-symmetric carrying no electric dipole\nmoment. Hence, if the lattice is able to relax into a lower\nsymmetry via a Jahn-Teller distortion this transition is\nexpected not to be dipolar. In this sense the ferroelectricity in the heavy rare earth manganites exists not due to,\nbut despite the superimposed orbital order and comparing the relevant energy scales it has to be regarded as a\nsecond order effect. Therefore the ferroelectric distortion\nis rather weak and so far could not be proven directly\nusing high-resolution neutron or x-ray diffraction techniques. However, the onset of ferroelectricity was documented via pyroelectric measurements and is connected\nto a distinct anomaly in the real part of the dielectric\npermittivity10 and clear features in the anisotropic thermal expansion.21 This underlines that the ferroelectric\n\n\fdistortions are driven by frustrated magnetic interactions\nvia local exchange-striction.8\nHowever, within the scenario of partially frustrated\nMn-spins the role of the magnetic A-sites is not completely clear so far. Generally, the moments of the rareearth ions are polarized due to the coupling with the Mn\nsubsystem resulting in a noticeable anisotropic contribution to the low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the manganites as e.g. recently studied in detail for the systems PrMnO3 and NdMnO3 .22 As\nanalyzed for the case of TbMnO3 by Quezel et al.17,23 the\noverall magnetic structure in the rare-earth manganites\ncan be rather complex. They found a sine-wave ordering of the Mn3+ moments with the ordering wave vector\nalong the b-axis below 40 K and a short-range incommensurate ordering of the Tb3+ moments with a different wave vector below 7 K. At the ordering temperature\nof the rare-earth moments significant anomalies in the\ndielectric constant can be found denoting the possible\ninfluence of the magnetic A-sites.10\nIn this paper we report structural, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat measurements for\nsingle and poly-crystalline Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 . Our focus\nis directed towards the isovalent doping of the trivalent\nA-site in RMnO3 , with R denoting elements Eu3+ (4f8 )\nor Y3+ ([Kr]).24 This allows for a systematic variation\nof the ionic radii and possibly of the Mn-O-Mn angle,\nwhich we relate to the development of the complex magnetic groundstates and ferroelectric phases analogous to\nthe pure rare-earth compounds RMnO3 with R = Gd,\nDy, Tb. The system (Eu:Y)MnO3 offers the possibility to continuously control the A-site volume of the orbitally ordered perovskite structure and thus to tune the\ncorresponding multiferroic phases without the additional\ninfluence of a magnetic rare earth moment. A further\naspect of the system Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 is the robustness\nof long-range polar order against the influence of purely\nstructural A-site disorder.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nEu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 single crystals were grown in Ar flow\nby a floating-zone method with radiation heating for Yconcentrations x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5. Additional\nconcentrations have been prepared as poly-crystals for\nhigher concentrations up to x = 0.95 using conventional\nsolid state reaction methods. Powder-diffraction experiments were performed on powder of crushed single and\npoly-crystals at room temperature with a STOE diffractometer utilizing Cu-K\u03b1 radiation with a wave length\n\u03bb = 0.1541 nm. The magnetic susceptibility and the\nmagnetization were recorded using a commercial SQUID\nmagnetometer for temperatures T < 400 K and external\nmagnetic fields up to 50 kOe. The dielectric constant has\nbeen measured employing a frequency response analyzer\n(Novocontrol \u03b1-analyzer and HP4284A ) and the\nspontaneous electric polarization was recorded as inte-\n\nintensity (arb. units)\n\n2\n\n1\n\nEu\n\n0.9\n\nY\n\n0.1\n\nMnO\n\n3\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Representative powder XRD-Pattern\nfor the Eu0.9 Y0.1 MnO3 .

The bars in between denote reflections of the\nPbnm structure.\n\ngrated pyro-current. The specific heat was measured in\na PPMS-system (Quantum-Design).\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nStructure\n\nA typical result for the structural characterization of\nthe samples by x-ray diffraction is shown in Fig. 1. The\ndiffraction patterns were refined using Rietveld analysis.\nAll samples investigated revealed the O' orthorhombic\nstructure (Pbnm). No impurity phases were detected\nabove background level for Y-concentrations x < 0.75.\nFor higher concentrations (as denoted in Fig. 2), small\ntraces of the hexagonal (P63cm) phase of YMnO3 show\nup which could be estimated to be below 2 % and will not\nconsiderably influence the regarded macroscopic properties. The lattice constants and the volume of the unit cell\nas derived from the profile analysis are shown in Fig. 2.\nIn addition, the data for the system La1\u2212y Gdy MnO3 ,\nwhich was taken from Ref. [14], is displayed on a separate scale. Both scales, for Gd-doping y and Y-doping x\nare shifted to achieve an overlap of the \u221a\nstructural data.\nFor all concentrations we find b > a > c/ 2 indicative for\na static JT distortion superimposed on the high temperature O-type (i.e. not JT distorted) orthorhombic structure, which results from the buckling and tilting of the\nMnO6 octahedra due to geometrical constraints. However, for Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 , despite the continuous shrinking of the lattice volume V , the orthorhombic distortion\nparameterized by \u03b5 = (b \u2212 a)/(a + b) tends to saturate\nfor higher Y-concentrations. The inequality of the lattice constants a and b reflects the tilting of the octahedra around the b-axis and implies significant deviations\nfrom 180\u25e6 of the Mn-O-Mn bond angle \u03c6 within the ab-\n\n\f3\nY MnO\n\n1-x\n\n0.0\n\n)\n\nEu\n\na\n\n235\n\n230\n\n3\n\n(\u00c5 )\n\n240\n\nPbnm\n\n5.6\n\nV\n\nc/ 2\n225\n\n5.2\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n0.035\n\n0.030\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nplane. Another quantity reflecting the development of\n\u03c6 is the tilting distortion along b of the A-site as obtained from the Rietveld refinement of the atomic positions. This parameter (not shown) is almost constant\nfor the system Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 in contrast to the less distorted system La1\u2212y Gdy MnO3 .14 This implies, that the\nalteration of the spin system due to the influence of the\nMn-O-Mn bond angle may not be the only valid mechanism for Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 . In addition, the variation of\nthe magnetic exchange via the reduction of the volume\nand the corresponding changes in the orbital overlap may\nalso have to be considered. Also the A-site disorder and\nthe corresponding variance in the A-site ionic radii could\nplay an important role.

However, for Eu low-lying\nmultiplets give rise to a Van-Vleck type of contribution,\nwhich in this temperature regime is nearly Curie-like and\nthus enhances the effective paramagnetic moment. For\na more detailed analysis the paramagnetic high temperature behavior was fitted by a sum of the contribution\nof Eu3+ (\u221d (1 \u2212 x)) and the CW type contribution of\nMn3+ . For the Eu-contribution we used the well known\nfree ion susceptibility of Eu3+ determined by its excited\nmultiplets with E1 \u2248 500 K and E2 \u2248 3E1 for J = 1 and\nJ = 2, respectively.26,27 At high temperatures it is linear\nin 1/T while at low T it is determined by a temperature\n\n\f4\n0.5\n\nEu\n\n0.8\n\nY\n\n0.2\n\nMnO\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n25 K\n20 K\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n\nM (\n\nB\n\n/Mn)\n\n34 K\n\n0.0\n\n10 K\n2 K\n\n-0.5\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nH (kOe)\n\nFIG. 4:\n(Color online) Magnetization along c of\nEu0.8 Y0.2 MnO3 as function of the external magnetic field for\na series of temperatures between 2 K and 34 K.\n\nindependent Van-Vleck contribution. All our data can\nbe nicely described using peff,Mn as plotted in the lower\ninset of Fig. 3 (\u25e6). The manganese contribution turns\nout to be independent of x and\np agrees well with the expected theoretical value 2\u03bcB [S(S + 1)] = 4.9\u03bcB . For\nconcentrations x \u2264 0.5 the CW-temperatures of the Mnsubsystem are \u0398 \u2248 \u221258\u00b14 K and are almost independent\nof x. This result is in agreement with corresponding findings in La1\u2212y Gdy MnO3 for high Gd concentrations.14\nBelow 50 K all compositions undergo a magnetic transition into an incommensurate antiferromagnetic (IC)\nphase as concluded in analogy to the pure rare earth\ncompounds.9 This transition was clearly detected by\nheat-capacity experiments, which will be discussed later.\nIt can only be seen as a small change of slope in the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility\nas it is not connected with the onset of a ferromagnetic component (see upper inset of Fig. 3). A much\nstronger anomaly appears at the transition from the incommensurate magnetic state into the canted A-type antiferromagnetic (CAFM), which takes place for concentrations x \u2264 0.3. As revealed by the upper frame of\nFig. 3, the onset of CAFM order at TCAFM shows up\nas a strong upturn of magnetization indicating a significant ferromagnetic contribution. This FM component\narises due to spin canting, which can be explained by\nthe Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and is an intrinsic\nfeature of the CAFM state in RMnO3 systems.28,29 As\nstated above, TCAFM continuously decreases from 140 K\nin LaMnO3 down to about 20 K in GdMnO3 . For the system Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 this transition is shifted to T \u2248 0 for\nY-concentrations of about 0.2 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3. For TbMnO3\nand for concentrations x \u2265 0.3 in Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 no Atype AFM can be found but the character of the mag-\n\nnetic phase changes from a sinusoidal to a helicoidal (spiral) magnetic structure at temperatures between 20 and\n30 K.17 This latter transition is connected with the onset\nof ferroelectric order as will be discussed later. However, it still seems a controversial debate if this spiral\nAFM structure remains incommensurate17 or locks-in at\na commensurate wave vector.30 It should be noted that\nat least for the composition x = 0.5 additional small\nanomalies can be found at the FE transitions at 24 K\nand 18 K, indicative for a partial rearrangement of the\nmagnetic structure.\nFig. 4 shows the magnetization M (H) for\nEu0.8 Y0.2 MnO3 in magnetic fields up to 5 T as\nmeasured after zero-field cooling. At T = 34 K (upper\nframe of Fig. 4) an apparently paramagnetic magnetization behavior is detected. As can be deduced from the\nspecific heat data (presented below) the magnetic state\nof the sample at this temperature is in fact the IC phase.\nAt 25 K the CAFM state can be induced by the magnetic\nfield as reflected by the twofold hysteresis loop with\nthe typical signature of a smeared out metamagnetic\nphase transition at H \u2248 30 kOe. On further decreasing\ntemperature this metamagnetic transition becomes fully\nirreversible and the two loops are merged into one as\nit is characteristic for a weak ferromagnet. After the\ninitial increase of the field the CAFM state persists\nand only the ferromagnetic component is switched at\na sharply defined coercive field, which increases up to\nHc \u2248 40 kOe for the lowest temperatures. At 2 K\n(lower frame of Fig. 4) even an intermediate state with\na smaller ferromagnetic component is stabilized after\nthe initial increase of the magnetic field leading to an\nasymmetric shape of the hysteresis loop.\n\nC.\n\nDielectric properties\n\nFig. 5 displays the real part of the dielectric constant\nas measured in the radio-frequency range for various concentrations of Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 . All \u03b5\u2032 (T ) curves show a\nsteplike increase with increasing temperature along the\nc-direction. Its point of inflection is located around 50 K\nbut as shown exemplarily for the concentration x = 0.5\n(lower right frame of Fig. 5) its position is strongly\nfrequency dependent. Similar phenomena have already\nbeen found e.g. for TbMnO3 and have been ascribed to\nthe relaxation of localized polarons.8 In the following we\nwill concentrate on the anomalies below 45 K. For pure\nEuMnO3 only a tiny kink can be found near T \u2248 43 K.\nThis coincides with the onset of weak ferromagnetism in\nthe CAFM phase as revealed from the magnetic susceptibility measurements. For x = 0.2 a similar anomaly at\nTCAFM \u2248 22 K can be observed, which can hardly be\nrecognized, but a much more prominent peak occurs at\n30 K. For x = 0.3 this anomaly is located at 26 K and\nfor x = 0.5 it forms a double-peak structure at roughly\n23 K and 19 K. A similar double structured peak can also\nbe detected along the a-direction, however with shifted\n\n\f5\n\nEu\n\nY MnO\n\n1-x\n\nx\n\n3\n\n24\n30\n23\n\n'\n\n29\n22\n\n28\n\nE || c\n\n21\n\n|| c\n\n27\n\nx = 0\n\nx = 0.2\n\n20\n\n26\n\n50\n\n20\n\n'\n\n|| a\n\n|| a\n\n19\n\n25\n\nEu\n\n300\n\nY MnO\n\n1-x\n\nx\n\n3\n\nx = 0.5\n\nE || a\n\n200\n\n2\n\nP ( C/m )\n\nweight from higher to the lower temperature peak. These\nanomalies in \u03b5\u2032 (T ) coincide with the onset of ferroelectricity as will be described later. For the concentrations\nx = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 the electric polarization P (T ) is\nshown in Fig. 6. As revealed by the uppermost frame\nof Fig. 6, obviously the double structure in \u03b5\u2032 (T ) for\nEu0.5 Y0.5 MnO3 (lower right frame of Fig. 5) corresponds\nto the partial spontaneous reorientation of P from the\nc- to the a-direction. This is in accord with recent results obtained for x \u2248 0.4 by Kuwahara and coworkers.25\nSuch a spontaneous reorientation of the electric polarization is not reported for the pure systems RMnO3 .10 For\nthe compositions Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 with x = 0.3 and 0.2 no\ntemperature dependent reorientation of the polarization\ncould be observed as it is shown in the lower frames of\nFig. 6. It is remarkable that despite the magnetoelectric\norigin of the FE order no clear anomaly in P (T ) can be\nobserved for x = 0.2 around 23 K where a spontaneous\nFM component sets in. However, as can be seen from\nFig. 4 the values for the spontaneous magnetization stay\nbelow 0.2\u03bcB per Mn3 + ion. This is only 1/20th of the\nmaximal ordered moment of 4\u03bcB . Thus the effective FM\nmoment can be explained by a canting of the presumably\nspiral magnetic structure of less than 3\u25e6 , which represents\nan only small modification of the magnetic structure.\nFerroelectricity (FE) does not occur for concentrations\n\n100\n\n|| c\n\n0\n600\n\n|| a\n\nx = 0.3\n\n400\n200\n\n|| c\n\n0\n400\n\n|| a\n\nx = 0.2\n\n200\n0\n\n|| c\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Electric polarization as measured\non heating after cooling down in a poling field of about\n100 V/mm for the Y-concentrations x = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5.\n\nbelow x < 0.2. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that a\ncanted, i.e. weakly ferromagnetic state and FE are not\nmutually exclusive. For x = 0.2 the system first becomes\nferroelectric at TFE \u2248 30 K and then the ferromagnetism\nevolves roughly 8 K below. In a strict sense, this is the\nonly multiferroic system among the rare earth perovskite\nmanganites where the ground state seems to combine the\nproperties of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity.

Additional data\nfor Eka is given for the concentrations x = 0.3 and 0.5 (lower\nframes, short dashes). In general, the measured data of \u03b5\u2032\nmay comprise a constant additional contribution due to stray\ncapacitance of the measurement setup together with an relative uncertainty of up to 25 % due to the determination of the\nsample geometry. Hence, the absolute values of \u03b5\u2032 (T ) are not\ndiscussed. However, the relative accuracy of the measurement\nis much higher and lies within the thickness of the lines.\n\nFig. 7 presents the results of heat-capacity measurements in Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 as function of temperature. The\nheat capacity, plotted as C/T , is shown for temperatures\nT < 65 K and concentrations 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5. A well defined\nlambda-like anomaly shows up between 45 K and 50 K\nfor all concentrations under investigation. In agreement\nwith magnetization data and deduced from observations\nin other rare-earth manganites this anomaly has to be interpreted as onset of the IC spin structure, which gives no\nmacroscopic FM moment.8 The transition temperature is\nslightly decreasing with increasing Y-concentration. Below 45 K for each concentration a further anomaly appears at lower temperatures which for pure EuMnO3 is\ncharacterized by a sharp peak in C/T at 44 K corresponding to the transition into the A-type AFM-phase (see\n\n\f6\n\nEu\n\n1-x\n\nY MnO\nx\n\n3\n\nx =\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\nC/T (J/molK )\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nEuMnO\n\n0.5\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\nGdMnO\n\n3\n\nx\n\nC/T\n0.0\n0\n\n100\n\n10\n200\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Heat capacity of Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 plotted as C/T as a function of temperature.

For the Y doped samples this feature gets considerably smeared out presumably due to the influence\nof disorder. Again the corresponding transition temperature as denoted by the onset of the broad shoulder-like\ncontribution is monotonously decreasing with increasing\nx down to about 20 K for x = 0.5. However, even though\nthe shape of this anomaly in C/T is not altered qualitatively, the corresponding transition refers to different\nground states for different compositions. As it was already revealed in Figs. 3 and 6 the onset of spontaneous\nmagnetization corresponds to the transition into a new\nmagnetic ground state with FM and FE components for\nconcentrations x \u2248 0.2. For higher concentrations the\nspiral IC structure persists down to lowest temperatures\nin analogy to the pure rare earth compounds, but the onset of a FE polarization corresponds to a change from a\nsinusoidal to a helicoidal magnetic structure.17 The absence of any qualitative differences in the curvature of\nC/T for the different compositions reflects that the corresponding ground states together with their partially\nfrustrated spin structures are nearly degenerate.\nIt is worth mentioning that the low temperature specific heat in this system differs essentially from that of\nGdMnO3 or TbMnO3 due to the missing contribution\nof the magnetic rare earths.8,14 Neither a Schottky-type\ncontribution as found due to the rare earth spins, which\nare polarized in the effective exchange field from the\nCAFM Mn-sublattice, nor an anomaly due to the subsequent ordering of the magnetic rare earth sublattice\nin the temperature range below 10 K can be detected\nfor Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 .

This contribution can not be explained by the\nslight differences of the phonon spectrum because Gd and\nEu have very similar masses. \u2206C(t) shows a broad peak\nat around 120 K and can be explained by the relatively\nsmall splitting of the Eu-multiplet, which also gives rise\nto the Van-Vleck contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, discussed above.\n\nIV.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAM\n\nBased on the results shown above, from the magnetic\nand dielectric measurements as well as from the heat\ncapacity, a detailed (x, T )-phase diagram can be constructed and is shown in Fig. 8. The paramagnetic regime\nabove TN \u2248 45 \u2212 50 K, is followed by the sinusoidal IC\nstructure of the manganese moments, an interpretation\nguided by results for TbMnO3 17,23 and o-HoMnO3 .31 For\nsmall Y-concentrations, x \u2264 0.2, this incommensurate\nspin-structure locks into the weakly ferromagnetic A-type\nCAFM phase. For higher concentrations, x \u2265 0.3, the\nground state is ferroelectric but no ferromagnetic component can be found. Obviously, the spin-structure does not\nlock into the CAFM anymore. However, like in TbMnO3\nit remains unclear so far, if the magnetic structure still\nis incommensurate17 or if a commensurate long wavelength magnetic vector is established.30 In a small regime\naround x \u2248 0.2 weak ferromagnetism (CAFM) and weak\nferroelectricity coexist in contrast to the pure multiferroic rare earth manganites. Regarding the volume of the\nunit cell, the series Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 covers the values of\nGdMnO3 and TbMnO3 . Pure EuMnO3 is not ferroelectric. GdMnO3 is ferroelectric along a in a weak external\nmagnetic field along b, which destroys the A-type AFM\nstructure.10 For Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 a concentration slightly\n\n\f7\nlower than x = 0.2 probably will reproduce this property\nof GdMnO3 . However, according to Fig. 2 the Eu:Ysystem corresponding to GdMnO3 should have x \u2248 0.2.\nThis composition is already ferroelectric without magnetic field even though a canted AFM structure persists.\nPure TbMnO3 is ferroelectric along c.10 However, concerning the volume of the unit cell it could not be reproduced by pure single crystalline Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 close to\nx \u2248 0.85 as shown in Fig. 2. In TbMnO3 there is an additional anisotropy due to Tb-ions and Tb-Mn exchange\nwhich could lead to the observed electric polarization\nalong the c-axis. This should be taken into account for\nthe comparison between TbMnO3 and Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3\nsystems. However, the tendency towards a spontaneous\nferroelectric component along c is already indicated also\nfor Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 at lower Y-concentrations like x = 0.5\n(Fig. 6).\nIt is interesting that only the weak FE component\nalong a coexists with spontaneous weak ferromagnetism,\nnamely within the concentration range around x \u2248 0.2,\nwhile for higher concentrations, where at least an intermediate FE component along c is detected, no weak ferromagnetism shows up. According to the symmetry properties of the magnetoelectric coupling for the rare earth\nmanganites12,16,17 , the ferroelectric polarization vector is\northogonal to both, the vector of the magnetic spiral and\nthe magnetic modulation vector, which points along the\nb axis.9 For TbMnO3 17 and analog for the higher Yconcentrations of Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 the ferroelectric component points along the c-direction, which is compatible\nwith a spiral vector along a (i.e. the spins rotating in\nthe bc-plane). For GdMnO3 (in small magnetic fields\nalong c21 ) and similarly for the concentrations around\nx \u2248 0.2 of Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 , the ferroelectric component\npoints along the a-direction. This would be compatible\nwith a spiral vector along c (i.e. the spins rotating in the\nab-plane). The homogeneous canting of this helicoidal\nspin structure out of the ab-plane could then generate\nthe observed ferromagnetic moment along c.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have characterized poly- and singlecrystalline samples of the system Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 by\nmeans of structural, magnetic, thermodynamic, and di-\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nM.

In comparison with recently published results for the pure rare earth systems we constructed a (T, x)-phase diagram for compositions x \u2264\n0.5. The ground state Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 changes from\na canted A-type AFM without long range polar order for concentrations x < 0.15 towards a presumably incommensurate spiral magnetic structure coexisting with a ferroelectric component for x \u2265 0.3. For these\nhigher Y-concentrations the orientation of the ferroelectric component changes spontaneously from the c-axis\nat higher temperatures towards the a-axis for low temperatures. The regime with P k c increases with increasing Y-concentration. In this sense Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3\nresembles the development of the ferroelectric orientation with decreasing ionic A-site radius as in the system\nTb1\u2212x Gdx MnO3 .32 Hence, all essential magnetoelectric\nproperties existing in the pure rare earth compounds\nGdMnO3 and TbMnO3 are reproduced. The influence\nof the magnetic rare earth seems to be restricted to the\ndistortion of the magnetic structure connected with the\nmagnetic A-site ordering at low temperatures. The modulation of the magnetic structure related to the onset of\nferroelectricity is realized due to the Mn sublattice only.\nHowever, the contraction of the lattice with increasing x\nin Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 is less effective than estimated from\nthe average ionic A-site radii in comparison to the pure\nrare earth compounds, which points towards the importance of disorder effects. The latter may also influence\nthe properties in the concentration range around x \u2248 0.2\nwhere a finite spontaneous magnetic moment and ferroelectricity coexist. The details of the underlying magnetic structure are not yet verified but it is plausible to\nexpect a spontaneously canted spiral. Such a FM and FE\nground state has not been found in the pure rare earth\ncompounds so far and deserves further study.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partly supported by the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) via Grant\nNo. VDI/EKM 13N6917-A, by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via Sonderforschungsbereich SFB 484\n(Augsburg), and by INTAS and Russian Foundation\nfor Basic Researches N 04-02-16592, 06-02-17514, 04-0281046-Bel2004.\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(2005).\nT.
