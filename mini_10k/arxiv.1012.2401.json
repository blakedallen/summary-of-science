Therefore, the solutions to the equation are\nclassical.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to study the regularity assumptions needed on a vector field b for the\nsolutions to an equation with drift and fractional diffusion\nut + b * \u2207u + (\u2212\u25b3)s u = f\n\n(1.1)\n\nto be differentiable (and therefore classical). We do not assume the vector field b to be divergence\nfree.\nWe will concentrate in the so called supercritical case s \u2208 (0, 1/2]. The case s = 1 is usually\nreferred to as the critical case, and s \u2208 (0, 1/2) as the supercritical regime because the drift term\nis of higher order than the diffusion term. In [17] it is shown that if b \u2208 C 1\u22122s in space for s < 1/2\nor b \u2208 L\u221e for s = 1/2, then u becomes H\u00f6lder continuous for positive time. In this paper we\nprove that with the slightly better regularity assumption b \u2208 C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2s), we\nobtain that the solution u becomes C 1,\u03b1 in space. This is large jump in regularity for a seemingly\nminimal extra regularity assumption in b. Note that b \u2208 C 1\u22122s is the assumption that matches\nthe scaling of the equation. A slightly better assumption like b \u2208 C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 allows us to use local\nperturbative techniques and thus obtain much better regularity results.\nFor the case s \u2265 1/2, a related result has recently been obtained in [15], where a similar\nregularity for an eigenvalue problem is established.\nOur main result is the following.\nTheorem 1.1. Let b be a vector field in L\u221e ([\u22121, 0], C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 (B1 )) and f \u2208 L\u221e ([\u22121, 0], C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 (B1 ))\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2s), then any bounded solution u of (1.1) in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1 is C 1,\u03b1 in space. Moreover, an estimate holds\n\u0001\n||u||L\u221e ([\u22121/2,0],C 1,\u03b1 (B1/2 )) \u2264 C ||u||L\u221e ([\u22121,0]\u00d7Rn ) + ||f ||L\u221e ([\u22121,0],C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 (B1 ))\n\nwhere the constant C depends on s, n and ||b||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 only.\n\nIf b \u2208 C 1\u22122s and f \u2208 C 1\u22122s (case \u03b1 = 0) we can prove that u is almost Lipschitz in space\nmaking a mild local smallness assumption. We state that as a second theorem. The proof is\ncontained in the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.2. There exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that the following result holds. Let b \u2208 [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1 be\na vector field such that for some r > 0 and any t \u2208 [\u22121, 0],\n|b(t, x) \u2212 b(t, y)|\n\u2264 \u03b4.\n|x \u2212 y|1\u22122s\n|x\u2212y|<r\nsup\n\n(1.2)\n\nAssume also that f \u2208 C 1\u22122s in space, then any bounded solution u of (1.1) in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1 is C \u03b2\nin space for all \u03b2 < 1. Moreover, an estimate holds\n\u0001\n||u||L\u221e ([\u22121/2,0],C \u03b2 (B1/2 )) \u2264 C ||u||L\u221e ([\u22121,0]\u00d7Rn ) + ||f ||L\u221e ([\u22121,0],C 1\u22122s (B1 ))\n\nwhere the constant C depends on r, s, n, \u03b2 and ||b||C 1\u22122s only.\n\nThe focus of this paper is on the regularity estimates for the solution u and not on the existence\nor uniqueness for a given vector field b and initial value u(x, 0) = u0 . It is our intention to use\nthis result as a useful criteria to conclude that a solution is classical that could be applied to a\nvariety of nonlinear equations with drift and fractional diffusion. Some applications are:\n\u2022 It implies the result in [5] about a regularity criteria for the supercritical surface quasigeostrophic equation.\n\u2022 It complements [4] and [12] to prove that the solutions to the supercritical Burgers equation\nbecome classical for large time, instead of only H\u00f6lder continuous.\n\u2022 Combined with [17], it implies the result in [6]. Moreover, it proves a more general version\nof the result where u = L(\u2212\u25b3)\u2212s \u03b8 for any operator L of order zero (any combination of\nRiesz transforms or singular integrals), without assuming that div u = 0.\n\u2022 For any conservation law with fractional diffusion\n\u03b8t + div F (\u03b8) + (\u2212\u25b3)s \u03b8 = 0\nwith F being a smooth nonlinear function, it proves that if \u03b8 \u2208 C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 , then actually\n\u03b8 \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 and it is a classical solution.\n\u2022 For the Hamilton Jacobi equation with fractional diffusion\nut + H(\u2207u) + (\u2212\u25b3)s u = 0,\nif H is smooth, it implies that if u \u2208 C 1,1\u22122s+\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0 then, applying Theorem\n1.1 to the directional derivatives of u, u \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 for all \u03b1 < 2s. In the case of s = 1/2, this\nprovides an improvement of the regularity obtained in [18].\nWe also plan to use this result in future work for obtaining partial regularity results for nonlinear problems for which some decay can be proved. For example, we expect that the methods\nin this paper would allow us to improve the results from [16] and [4], although these two results\nhave recently been improved with different methods in [8] and [12].\nWe stress that there is no assumption on the divergence of b for either Theorem 1.1 or Theorem\n1.2. This allows us to apply the result to a larger class of equations. Moreover, there is no energy\ninequality for equation (1.1) and variational methods do not seem to be suitable for a proof.\nThe idea of the proof is to approximate locally the solution to the drift-diffusion equation by a\nsolution to a drift-less problem via a change of variables (which is equivalent to approximating the\nsolution locally by the solution to a problem with constant drift). The drift-less problem has C \u221e\nsolutions, so we use it to show that there is a plane from which the solution separates slowly. A\n2\n\n\fprecise estimate on this separation leads to the C 1,\u03b1 estimate. This general idea goes back to the\nclassical result of Cordes [7] and Nirenberg [14] for second order elliptic equations. For stationary\nintegro-differential equation of order larger than one, it was developed in great generality in [2].\nThere is a difficulty that arises when trying to apply this method to integral equations of order\none or less. The problem is that the affine functions that are used in the approximations have a\nlinear growth at infinity that already makes the tails of the integrals divergent when s \u2264 1/2. In\nthis paper this difficulty is overcome by rewriting the equation using the extension from [1] and\ncomplementing the affine function in the original variable x with an extra term in the variable y\nwith appropriate homogeneity (depending on s).\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we explain the extended problem.\nThe value 1 + 2s appears as the order of the second term in the expansion of solutions to the\nextended problem, and that is the main reason of the constraint \u03b1 < 2s in Theorem 1.1 even for\nf = 0. In section 3 we discuss the applicability of Theorem 1.1 to viscosity solutions. Essentially,\nthe proof uses only the comparison principle with smooth sub and supersolutions, and thus it\nadapts perfectly to the case of viscosity solutions. In sections 4 and 5, we develop the necessary\nregularity estimates for the drift-less problem. These estimates are not difficult and they take a\nlarge proportion of this article. But they need to be proved because the fractional heat equation\nis not classical in its extended version. The proofs in section 4 and 5 use essentially the same\nideas as the usual heat equation and hence they are very standard. On a first read of this paper,\nit would be convenient to just skim through the results in these two sections. In section 6, the\nH\u00f6lder estimates from [17] are adapted to the extended problem. Sections 7, 8 and 9 are where\nthe most important work of this paper is carried out specifically in order to prove Theorem 1.1.\nNotation:\n\u2022 The variable x will always be used for a point in Rn and y to be the extra coordinate in R+\nfor the extension to the upper half space. Sometimes the capital letter X will be used to\ndenote a point in the upper half space Rn \u00d7 R+ . Thus X = (x, y).\n\u2022 By B1+ we denote the half ball centered at (0, 0) in the upper half space. i.e. B1+ = {(x, y) \u2208\nRn \u00d7 R+ : |x|2 + y 2 < 1}.\n\u2022 By B10 we denote the unit ball either in the original space Rn or in the boundary of the\nupper half space Rn \u00d7 {0}.\n\u2022 By (\u2202B1 )+ we denote the upper half part of the boundary of the unit ball \u2202B1 for which\ny > 0. Thus (\u2202B1 )+ = \u2202B1 \u2229 {y > 0}. Also \u2202B1+ = B10 \u222a (\u2202B1 )+ .\n\n2\n\nThe extended problem\n\nIn [1], the fractional Laplacian was characterized as a Dirichlet to Neumann problem for a degenerate elliptic equation. More precisely, given a function f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R, we can compute (\u2212\u25b3)s f by\nsolving the following Dirichlet problem in the upper half space\nu(x, 0) = f (x) in Rn\ndiv y a \u2207u = 0 in Rn \u00d7 R+\n\n(2.1)\n\nThen (\u2212\u25b3)s f = c limy\u21920 y a \u2202y u. Here \u2207u stands for the full gradient respect to the original\nvariable x \u2208 Rn and the extended variable y \u2208 R+ . The constant a is equal to 1 \u2212 2s. The most\neffective way to remember the relation between a and s is to use dimensional analysis. The order\nof the operator (\u2212\u25b3)s is 2s, whereas y a \u2202y u is of order 1 \u2212 a (\u2212a because of y a and +1 because of\n\u2202y ), thus 2s = 1 \u2212 a.\n3\n\n\fNote that since in this paper we focus on the case s \u2208 (0, 1/2), the value of a stays in the range\na \u2208 (0, 1).\nWe rewrite the equation (1.1) using the characterization of the fractional Laplacian as a Dirichlet to Neumann operator given in [1].\nut (t, x, 0) + b(t, x) * \u2207x u \u2212 c lim y a \u2202y u(t, x, y) = f (t, x) for x \u2208 Rn and t \u2208 (0, \u221e)\ny\u21920\n\ndiv y a \u2207u = 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor y > 0\n\nThe multiplicative constant c depends on the value of s (or, equivalently, on a). In terms of\nthe smoothness of the solution of (2.2), the value of c is irrelevant, since it can be modified with\na simple change of variables. So we will study the equation (2.2) with c = 1.\nThe usefulness of this construction comes from the fact that the equation has become local.\nThere is no integro-differential operator in (2.2), so the usual difficulty of keeping track of errors\ncoming from the tails of the integrals that one has to deal with when studying regularity of\nintegro-differential equations disappears in (2.2).\nIn the next lemmas, we will explore the behavior close to y = 0 of the solution to (2.1) when\nthe original function f is smooth.\nIt is useful to remember some special harmonic functions for the extension (2.1). The following\nlist plays the role of the first few harmonic polynomials.\n\u2022 For any constant vector A \u2208 Rn , the function u(x, y) = A*x solves (2.1) and limy\u21920 y a \u2202y u =\n0.\n\u2022 The function u(x, y) =\n\n1\n1\u2212a\n1\u2212a y\n\nsolves (2.1) and limy\u21920 y a \u2202y u = 1.\n\n\u2022 For any constant vector A \u2208 Rn , the function u(x, y) =\nlimy\u21920 y a \u2202y u = A * x.\n\u2022 The function u(x, y) = x2 \u2212\n\nn\n2\n1+a y\n\n1\n1\u2212a\n1\u2212a y\n\nA * x solves (2.1) and\n\nsolves (2.1) and limy\u21920 y a \u2202y u = 0.\n\nB\ny 1\u2212a play the role of the linear harmonic functions. Note that\nFunctions of the form A * x + 1\u2212a\n1\nthe next harmonic polynomial would be of the form A*x 1\u2212a\ny 1\u2212a , which has degree 2 \u2212 a = 1 + 2s.\nThe following lemmas show that a first order approximation of smooth functions f close to the\nboundary in the extension problem (9.1) has an error of order 1 + 2s. This is the reason why in\nour main theorem, even if the right hand side is zero, we do not obtain a regularity estimate of\nthe solution u in the space C 1,2s or better.\n\nLemma 2.1.

Let v be the extension to the upper half space of the function f extended to Rn as zero\noutside B10 .\n(\nf (x) for |x| < 1\nv(x, 0) =\n0\nfor |x| \u2265 1\ndiv y a \u2207v = 0\n\nin Rn \u00d7 (0, +\u221e)\n\nWe apply Lemma 2.1 and obtain an expansion like (2.4) for v.\nWe are left to show that the remainder w = u \u2212 v has an expansion of the same kind. From\nthe maximum principle, |v| is bounded by ||f ||L\u221e , and therefore ||v||L2 (B + ,ya ) \u2264 C||f ||L\u221e and\n1\n||w||L2 (B + ,ya ) \u2264 C(||f ||L\u221e + ||u||L2 (B + ,ya ) ).\n1\n1\nWe can consider the odd extension of w to the full ball B1 by w(x, \u2212y) = \u2212w(x, y) so that w\nsolves the degenerate elliptic equation across {y = 0}:\ndiv |y|a \u2207w = 0 in B1 .\nWe apply the Harnack inequality from [11] to w. Then w is H\u00f6lder continuous in the interior of\nB1 .

Since\na\n1\u2212a\ndiv y \u2207(y\n) = 0 in the upper half space {y > 0} we can apply the Boundary Harnack theorem\nfrom [10] to obtain that both wp /y 1\u2212a and wn /y 1\u2212a are H\u00f6lder continuous up the the boundary\n+\nin B5/8\n. Therefore, there exist a H\u00f6lder continuous function g\u0303 such that\n\nw(x, y) = g\u0303(x, y)y 1\u2212a\n\n+\n.\nin B5/8\n\nRecalling that u = v + w, so far we have proved that u has an expansion of the form u(x, y) =\nf (x) + y 1\u2212a g(x) + O(y 1\u2212a+\u03b1 ) for some \u03b1 > 0 (the H\u00f6lder exponent in g\u0303).\nWe can repeat the same argument for any derivative (or incremental quotient) of w with\nrespect to x. From Cacciopoli's inequality, all those derivatives are in L2 (y a ) and also solve the\nsame equation. Therefore we obtain\nwxi (x, y) = g\u0303xi (x, y)y 1\u2212a\n\n+\nin B5/8\n.\n\nwith gxi H\u00f6lder continuous. Repeating this argument, we obtain that g\u0303 is C \u221e in the x variable.\nNow consider u2 (x, y) = y a \u2202y w.

Let f : B10 \u2192 R be a C 1,1 function and u : B1+ \u2192 R satisfy the extension PDE:\nu(x, 0) = f on B10\ndiv(y a \u2207u) = 0 in B1+\nwhere a > 0.

From Lemma 2.2, u has an expansion of the form\nu(x, y) = f (x) + y 1\u2212a g(x) + O(y 2 )\nSince f \u2208 C 1,1 , f (x) = f (0) + x * \u2207f (0) + O(|x|2 ).\nThe function g is C 1+a . Since a > 0, then g is Lipschitz. If we choose D = g(0), we have\ng(x)y 1\u2212a = g(0)y 1\u2212a + O(|x|y 1\u2212a ).\nAdding the three terms together, we finish the proof.\n\n3\n\nWeak solutions\n\n3.1\n\nViscosity solutions\n\nSince we do not make any assumption on the divergence of b, integration by parts is complicated\nand the distributional sense is not suitable for defining weak solutions of (1.1). Since we are\nassuming that b is continuous, we can use the concept of viscosity solutions developed originally\nby Crandall and Lions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The most straight forward way to define it\nfor the integral equation (1.1) is the following.\nWe say that a continuous function u is a viscosity solution of (1.1) if for every point (x0 , t0 ) \u2208\n(\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B10 and every bounded function \u03c6 : [\u22121, t0 ] \u00d7 Rn such that\n1. \u03c6 is smooth around (t0 , x0 ),\n2. \u03c6(t0 , x0 ) = u(t0 , x0 ),\n3. \u03c6 \u2265 u (or respectively \u03c6 \u2264 u) in [\u22121, t0 ] \u00d7 Rn ,\nthen\n\u03c6t (t0 , x0 ) + b(t0 , x0 ) * \u2207\u03c6(t0 , x0 ) + (\u2212\u25b3)s \u03c6(t0 , x0 ) \u2264 f (t0 , x0 ) ( or \u2265 f (t0 , x0 ) respectively.)\nThis is the definition used in [18]. in the same way as distributional solutions of PDEs are\ndefined based on the property of integration by parts against smooth functions, viscosity solutions\nare defined based on the property of the comparison principle with smooth sub and super solutions.\nThis concept is more apparent in the following definition of viscosity solution for the extended\nproblem (2.2). Indeed, the definition says that a continuous function u is a viscosity solution if it\nsatisfies the appropriate comparison conditions with respect to smooth sub and super solutions.\nWe give the precise definition below.\n+\nWe say that a continuous function u : [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B 1 \u2192 R solves (2.2) in the viscosity sense if\nfor any t \u2208 [\u22121, 0], u(t, x, y) solves the Dirichlet problem (2.1) (classically) in {t} \u00d7 B1+ and for\nevery function \u03c6 : [t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ] \u00d7 B\u03b5+ (x0 ) \u2192 R such that\n1. \u03c6 is smooth in [t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ] \u00d7 B\u03b50 (x0 ),\n2. \u03c6 satisfies div y a \u2207\u03c6 = 0 in B\u03b5+ (x0 ) for all t \u2208 [t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ],\n3. \u03c6t + b * \u2207\u03c6 \u2212 limy\u21920 y a \u2202y \u03c6 \u2265 f (or \u2264 f respectively) in (t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ] \u00d7 B\u03b50 (x0 )\n4. \u03c6 \u2265 u (or \u2264 u respectively) on {t0 \u2212 \u03b5} \u00d7 B\u03b5+ (x0 ) \u222a [t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ] \u00d7 (\u2202B\u03b5 (x0 ))+ ,\n\n8\n\n\fthen \u03c6 \u2265 u or \u03c6 \u2264 u respectively, in the whole domain [t0 \u2212 \u03b5, t0 ] \u00d7 B\u03b5+ (x0 ).\nIt is not hard to prove that the definitions of viscosity solution for (1.1) implies the corresponding definition for (2.2) after the extension (2.1).\nViscosity solutions is the most appropriate type of weak solutions for the results in this paper.\nThe actual equation is used directly only in the proof of Lemma 7.1, and the way it is used is to\ncompare the solution with a classical subsolution.\nNote that for any other type of weak solution u (for example entropy solutions), the same\nfunction would solve the equation in the viscosity sense as long as the comparison principle with\nclassical sub and super-solutions holds. In practical cases, a drift-fractional diffusion equation may\nbe obtained as the linearization of an equation for which the comparison principle can be shown\nto apply, and thus the results of this paper would apply as well.\n\n3.2\n\nThe vanishing viscosity method\n\nOne way to avoid the concept of weak solutions completely is by adding a vanishing viscosity term\nand proving uniform estimates. This method is usually called the vanishing viscosity method. In\nthis context, it is not related to the concept of viscosity solutions at all despite the unfortunate\nsimilarity of the names.\nThe idea consists in adding an artificial viscosity term to the equation\nut + b * \u2207u + (\u2212\u25b3)s u \u2212 \u03b5\u25b3u = f in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 Rn .\nWith the added artificial viscosity \u03b5\u25b3u, the equation has a smooth classical solution.\nIf we prove that the estimates in this paper hold uniformly as \u03b5 \u2192 0, then the existence of\nclassical solutions for (1.1) follows by passage to the limit. In terms of the extended equation, the\nsame idea applies to\nut + b * \u2207u \u2212 ( lim y a \u2202y u) \u2212 \u03b5\u25b3u = f\n\nin (\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B10 .\n\ndiv y a \u2207u = 0\n\nin [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1+ .\n\ny\u21920\n\nThe estimates in this paper are indeed uniform as \u03b5 \u2192 0. The explicit form of the equation\n(2.2) is used only for Proposition 6.1 and Lemma 7.1. The first is a localized version of the result\nin [17], which adapts to the vanishing viscosity method (as pointed out in that paper). The second\nalso adapts to the vanishing viscosity method as it is analyzed in Remark 7.3.\nThe vanishing viscosity method is a very common approach for nonlinear conservation laws.\nIt is used for example in [3], [13] and [9] for problems with drift and fractional diffusion.\nIn this paper we prefer to focus on the estimates but we will point out precisely how the proofs\nadapt to either continuous viscosity solutions or to the vanishing viscosity approximation. It turns\nout that the precise form of the equation is used only in very specific steps in the paper, so it is\nonly necessary to analyze the type of solution at those points (See remarks 7.2 and 7.3)\n\n4\n\nInterior estimates for the fractional heat equation\n\nIn order to carry out the perturbative arguments to prove the main theorem, we need to have\ngood local regularity estimates for the drift-less equation.\nut (t, x, 0) \u2212 lim y a \u2202y u(t, x, y) = 0\n\non (\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B10\n\ndiv y a \u2207u = 0\n\nin [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1+\n\ny\u21920\n\n9\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fFor any time t \u2208 (0, 1), the solution of (4.1) is going to be C \u221e in in the interior of B10 .\nMoreover, u and all its partial derivatives of any order respect to x are Lipschitz in time. The\nsmoothness with respect to y can then be understood by Lemma 2.2.\nProposition 4.1. Let u be a bounded continuous solution of the equation (4.1), then u and ut\nare C \u221e with respect to the x variable in the interior of the domain. Moreover, for any multiindex\n\u03b1, the following estimate holds\n||\u2202x\u03b1 u||L\u221e ([\u22121/2,0]\u00d7B +\n\n1/2\n\n)\n\n\u2264 C\u03b1 kukL\u221e ([\u22121,0]\u00d7B + ) ,\n1\n\n0 ) \u2264 C\u03b1 kuk \u221e\n||\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202t u||L\u221e ([\u22121/2,0]\u00d7B1/2\nL ([\u22121,0]\u00d7B + ) .\n1\n\nHere the constant C\u03b1 depends on \u03b1, s and n only.\n+\n0\nProof. Note that if we show an estimate for u in Cx\u221e (B3/4\n), then the Cx\u221e estimate in B1/2\nfollows\nby the fact that, for each time, u is a bounded solution of the Dirichlet problem for the elliptic\nequation of the extension. The same argument cannot be made for ut since a priori we cannot\nconclude that ut is bounded in the extension where y > 0.\nBy a classical translation and scaling argument, it is enough to show the estimate at the point\n(0, 0, 0).\nLet h(t, x) be the fractional heat kernel,\n\nht + (\u2212\u25b3)s h = 0\n\nin (0, +\u221e) \u00d7 Rn\n\nh(x, 0) = \u03b40\nThere is no known closed form for h(t, x) in real variables. However, in Fourier variables it\n2s\nis simply \u0125(t, \u03be) = e\u2212t|\u03be| . Let us extend h to the upper half space h(t, x, y). Using the scale\ninvariance of the equation, we have that for some function H : Rn \u00d7 R+ \u2192 R+ ,\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\nn\n1\nh(t, x, y) = t\u2212 2s H t\u2212 2s x, t\u2212 2s y\n(4.2)\n\nThe function H is the extension to the upper half space to the function whose Fourier transform\n2s\nis e\u2212|\u03be| . It is bounded, smooth in x, and H(x, 0) \u2248 (1 + |x|)\u2212n\u22122s . From the Poisson formula in\n[1] we also obtain |Dk H(x, y)| \u2264 C(1 + y)2s (1 + |x| + y)\u2212n\u22122s\u2212k . The function h is bounded and\nC \u221e in x and t except around the point (0, 0, 0).\nThis function h is the heat kernel of fractional diffusion in the whole space. We will multiply it\nby a smooth cutoff function in order to find an expression of u(x, y, t) in terms of localized integral\n+\nquantities. Let \u03b7 be a smooth radially symmetric function in x and y, supported in B7/8\nand\n+\nidentically one in B3/4 . Note that since \u03b7 is radially symmetric and smooth, \u2202y \u03b7(x, y) = O(|y|) as\ny \u2192 0.

From this we deduce the\nsecond estimate of the Lemma.\nRemark 4.2. It is impossible to find a better regularity estimate in time in terms of the L\u221e\n+\n0\nnorm of u only. The problem is that the estimate for \u2202t u on B1/2\ncannot be extended to B1/2\n.\n+\n+\nOne can show that if u = 0 on (0, 1/2) \u00d7 (\u2202B1 ) and u = 1 on (1/2, 1) \u00d7 (\u2202B1 ) , then indeed\n0\nthe solutions to (4.1) will be only Lipschitz in time on {1/2} \u00d7 B1/2\n. However, just assuming\n+\n1\nthat u is continuous on (0, 1) \u00d7 (\u2202B1 ) would imply that u is C in time from the expression of\nut = limy\u21920 y a \u2202y u as a convolution.\n\n5\n\nBoundary behavior for the fractional heat equation\n\nIn this section we study the H\u00f6lder continuity of the solution to the fractional heat equation (4.1)\non the parabolic boundary. All the estimates in this section are proved by comparing the actual\nsolution with explicit barriers. The results are very natural. They simply say that if the Dirichlet\nboundary data for the fractional heat equation is H\u00f6lder continuous, then the solution is H\u00f6lder\n11\n\n\fcontinuous on the boundary. We tried to make the computations of the barriers as simple as\npossible, but some tedium is unavoidable. On a first reading of this paper, it would be advisable\nto skim through the results in this section.\nThe estimates in this section follow from the local properties of the fractional heat equation\n(4.1). The equation is properly a parabolic evolution equation on [\u22121, 0]\u00d7B10. For each fixed value\nof t, u solves the elliptic equation div y a \u2207u = 0 on {t} \u00d7 B1+ . We can expect to find regularity\nestimates on [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B10 and also on {t} \u00d7 B1+ for each t. However, in this section we do not\nintend to analyze a modulus of continuity with respect to t for u(t, x, y) for positive values of y,\nsince intuitively those quantities are not connected by the equation.\nWe start by constructing a barrier that will be useful to understand the continuity of u close\nto \u2202B1 for each fixed t.\nLemma 5.1 (Barrier for (\u2202B1 )+ ). Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and X0 = (x0 , y0 ) be any point on \u2202B1+ \\{y = 0}.\nThere exists a constant C > 0 such that the function\nB(X) = C(1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1 + |X \u2212 X0 |\u03b1\nis a supersolution of\ndiv y a \u2207B \u2264 0\n\nin B1+ .\n\nProof. One way to simplify the computations is to note that\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\ndiv y a \u2207B = y a \u25b3B + \u2202y B .\ny\nLet us use this formula to estimate the equation in the two terms of the definition of B. We\ncompute\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\na\ndiv y a \u2207 (1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1 = y a \u25b3(1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1 + \u2202y (1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1 ,\ny\n\u0001\na\n= y \u2212\u03b12(n + a)(1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1\u22121 + \u03b1(\u03b1 \u2212 1)4|X|2 (1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1\u22122 .\n\u0001\n= y a \u03b1(1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1\u22122 \u22122(n + a)(1 \u2212 |X|2 ) + 4|X|2 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\n\nThis is a negative value since \u03b1 < 1. Moreover, it becomes very negative as |X| gets close to 1.\nNow we estimate the second term.\n\u0012\n\u0013\ny \u2212 y0\na\n\u03b1\na\ndiv y \u2207 (|X \u2212 X0 | ) = \u03b1y n + \u03b1 \u2212 1 + a\n|X \u2212 X0 |\u03b1\u22122\ny\nSince y0 is positive and a > 0,\n\u2264 \u03b1y a (n + \u03b1 \u2212 1 + a) |X \u2212 X0 |\u03b1\u22122\n\nFor all X \u2208 B1+ , (1 \u2212 |X|2 )\u03b1\u22122 > c|X \u2212 X0 |\u03b1\u22122 , so we can choose a constant C > 0 such that\ndiv y a \u2207 (C(1 \u2212 |X|)\u03b1 + |X \u2212 X0 |\u03b1 ) \u2264 0\nfor all X \u2208 B1+ .\n+\n\nLemma 5.2 (Continuity on (\u2202B1 )+ ).

Here C depends on s, n and \u03b1.\nProof. From the assumption, the function U (x, y) = u(x0 , y0 ) + C0 B(x, y) is larger or equal than\nu on \u2202B1+ , where B(x, y) = B(X) is the supersolution constructed in Lemma 5.1. Therefore, from\ncomparison principle u \u2264 U in the whole half ball B1+ . Therefore\nu(x, y) \u2212 u(x0 , y0 ) \u2264 C0 B(x, y) \u2264 C0 C(|x \u2212 x0 | + |y \u2212 y0 |)\u03b1 .\n\nThe next barrier is useful to analyze the H\u00f6lder continuity close to B10 of solutions to div y a \u2207u =\n0 in B1+ . This barrier is not used in the rest of this section.\nLemma 5.3 (Barrier for B10 ). Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 a) and x0 \u2208 B10 .

From Lemma 5.6, the for any (x, y, t) \u2208 [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1+ and (x\u2217 , y \u2217 , t\u2217 ) as in Lemma 5.6, we\nhave\n|v(x, y, t) \u2212 v(x\u2217 , y \u2217 , t\u2217 )| \u2264 C(|x \u2212 x\u2217 | + |y \u2212 y \u2217 | + |t \u2212 t\u2217 |)\u03b1\u0303\nOn the other hand, since kukC \u03b1 ([\u22121,0]\u00d7B 0 ) \u2264 C and kukL\u221e ([\u22121,0],C \u03b1 (B + )) \u2264 C, we also have\n1\n\n1\n\n|u(x, y, t) \u2212 u(x\u2217 , y \u2217 , t\u2217 )| \u2264 C(|x \u2212 x\u2217 | + |y \u2212 y \u2217 | + |t \u2212 t\u2217 |)\u03b1\u0303\n+\nBut v(x\u2217 , y \u2217 , t\u2217 ) = u(x\u2217 , y \u2217 , t\u2217 ). Therefore, if (x, y, t) belongs to either [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 (B1+ \\ B1\u2212\u03c1\n) or\n0\n[\u22121, \u22121 + \u03b4] \u00d7 B1 , we have\n|v(x, y, t) \u2212 u(x, y, t)| \u2264 C\u03c1\u03b1\u0303 .\n\nMoreover, on each time slice t \u2208 [\u22121, \u22121 + \u03b4], we use maximum principle for the degenerate elliptic\nequation\ndiv y a \u2207(u \u2212 v) = 0 on {t} \u00d7 B1+ .\nThen |u\u2212v| \u2264 C\u03c1\u03b1\u0303 in [\u22121, \u22121+\u03b4]\u00d7B1+ .

Note that the fact that u solves the equation (2.2) is used only to apply the\ncomparison principle with the classical subsolution v\u0304, thus u only needs to satisfy (2.2) in the\nviscosity sense.\n\n17\n\n\fRemark 7.3. The proof of Lemma 7.1 adapts with little work to the vanishing viscosity framework.

The only\nmodification in the proof is that when we analyze the equation for v we also have the term \u03b50 \u25b3v,\nwhich is small since by Proposition 4.1, v is C 2 in x.\n\n8\n\nThe improvement of flatness lemma\n\nOur main regularity result is proved iteratively by showing that the values of the solution separate\nless and less from a plane in smaller scales.

This function v is\nsmooth, so u is close to a smooth function and the result follows.\n0\nProof of Lemma 8.1.

We can apply Lemma 8.1 to v to obtain that there are\nA and D uniformly bounded such that\nv(t, x, y) \u2212 v(0, 0, 0) \u2212 A * x \u2212 D(t) \u2212\n\nD\u2032 (t) 1\u2212a\ny\n\u2264 \u03c11+a .\n1\u2212a\n\nTherefore (9.4) holds for k + 1 with Ak+1 = Ak + \u03c1k\u03b1 A and Dk+1 = Dk + \u03c1k(\u03b1+a) D.

Therefore,\n(9.4) implies (9.3) and we finish the proof.\nRemark 9.2. In the proof of Lemma 9.1, we see the importance of rewriting the equation (1.1)\nusing the extension as in (2.2). The slope with respect to time Dt is compensated by subtracting\nDy 1\u2212a /(1 \u2212 a) in the extended (artificial) variable. The terms fit together nicely and the error\nterms from the nonlocal operators are completely avoided.

If \u03b1 = 0, Lemma 9.1 still applies with A = 0, and all Ak in the proof equal to zero\nas well.\n\n20\n\n\fWe now have all the results needed to prove the main theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let u be a bounded solution to (1.1) in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 Rn . By the usual translation and dilation argument, it is enough to show that the estimate holds at the point (0, 0). We\nwill prove that there is a vector A \u2208 Rn such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr1+\u03b1\n1\u22122s+\u03b1\n|u(0, x) \u2212 u(0, 0) \u2212 A * x| \u2264 C|x|1+\u03b1 ||u||L\u221e +\n||f ||C\n(9.6)\n\u03b4\nwhere \u03b4 is the constant from Lemma 9.1 and r depends on kbkC 1+2s\u2212\u03b1 .\nWe first normalize the solution by considering\n\u0169 =\n\nu(r2s t, rx) \u2212 u(0, 0)\n,\n1+\u03b1\n||u||L\u221e + r \u03b4 ||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1\n\nf \u0303 =\n\nr2s f (r2s t, rx)\n,\n1+\u03b1\n||u||L\u221e + r \u03b4 ||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1\n\nb\u0303 =\n\nr2s\u22121 b(r2s t, rx)\n.\n1+\u03b1\n||u||L\u221e + r \u03b4 ||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1\n\nIn this way, ||\u0169||L\u221e \u2264 1, and also ||f \u0303||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4 and ||b\u0303||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4 if r is small.\nNote that \u0169, b\u0303 and f \u0303 also satisfy the equation (1.1). We would finish the proof if we could apply\nLemma 9.1 to \u0169, b\u0303 and f \u0303. We extend \u0169 and f \u0303 to the upper half space. Note that the extension of\nu has the same L\u221e norm as u by the maximum principle (indeed, all that is needed is that the\nextension of u is bounded in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1+ ). The only hypothesis we are missing in order to apply\nLemma 9.1 are (9.2). We will make another change of variables.\nWe solve the following ODE backwards in time:\nV (0) = 0,\nV\u0307 (t) = b(t, V (t)) for t \u2208 (\u22121, 0).\nSince b is continuous, the ODE has at least one solution. Moreover, |V\u0307 | \u2264 C since b is bounded.\nWe also define\nZ 0\nS(t) =\nf \u0303(s, 0) ds,\nt\n\nwhich is clearly the solution of\n\nS(0) = 0\n\u1e60(t) = \u2212f (t, 0)\nTherefore we now consider\nu\u2217 (t, x, y) = \u0169(t, x + V (t), y) \u2212 S(t)\nb\u2217 (t, x) = b(t, x + V (t)) \u2212 b(t, V (t))\nf \u2217 (t, x) = f \u0303(t, x) \u2212 f (t, 0).\nAnd they solve the equation\nu\u2217t + b\u2217 * \u2207u\u2217 \u2212 lim y a \u2202y u\u2217 = f \u2217 in (\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B10\ny\u21920\n\ndiv y a \u2207u\u2217 = 0 in [\u22121, 0] \u00d7 B1+\n21\n\n\fMoreover, since ||f \u0303||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4 and ||b\u0303||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4, then f \u2217 and b\u2217 satisfy (9.2). So, we can\napply Lemma 9.1 to u\u2217 to obtain that there is A\u2217 \u2208 Rn and D\u2217 : [\u22121/2, 0] \u2192 R such that\nu\u2217 (t, x, y) \u2212 u\u2217 (0, 0, 0) \u2212 A\u2217 * x \u2212 D\u2217 (t) \u2212\n\nD\u2217\u2032 (t) 1\u2212a\n1\ny\n\u2264 C(|x| + y + t 2s )1+\u03b1 .\n1\u2212a\n\nBut note that \u0169(0, x, y) = u\u2217 (0, x, y) and\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr1+\u03b1\n||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 v \u2217 (0, r\u22121 x, r\u22121 y)\nu(0, x, y) = ||u||L\u221e +\n\u03b4\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1+\u03b1\nTherefore, if we set A = A\u2217 ||u||L\u221e + r \u03b4 ||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 r\u22121 , we obtain\n\n|u(0, x, 0) \u2212 u\u2217 (0, 0, 0) \u2212 A * x| \u2264 Cr |x|1+\u03b1 (||u||L\u221e + ||f ||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 ) ,\n\nwhich finishes the proof (recall that r depends on ||b||C 1\u22122s+\u03b1 ).\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Repeating the proof of Theorem 1.1 but with \u03b1 = 0 and A = 0, Theorem\n1.2 follows. The smallness of b\u0303 follows from (1.2) for small r.\nRemark 9.4. If we follow the iteration in the proof of Theorem 1.1 in the vanishing viscosity\nframework, we see that the artificial viscosity term \u03b5\u25b3u gets magnified in each successive scaling\nby \u03c1k(s\u22121) . For a large value of k, this value would be above the threshold to apply Lemma 7.1.\nBut at that point the second order diffusion takes over, and the rest of the iteration is trivial using\nthe regularization of the perturbed second order heat equation.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
