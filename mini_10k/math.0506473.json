In this paper we prove that in prime characteristic there is a functor \u2212p-Leib from the category of diassociative algebras to the category of\nrestricted Leibniz algebras, generalizing the functor from associative algebras\nto restricted Lie algebras. Moreover we define the notion of restricted universal\nenveloping diassociative algebra U dp (g) of a restricted Leibniz algebra g and\nwe show that U dp is left adjoint to the functor \u2212p-Leib . We also construct the\nrestricted enveloping algebra, which classifies the restricted Leibniz modules.\nIn the last section we put a restricted pre-Lie structure on the tensor product\nof a Leibniz algebra by a Zinbiel algebra.\n\nIntroduction\nIn characteristic p the notion of Lie algebra is fruitfully replaced by the notion of restricted Lie algebra, that is a Lie algebra equipped with a formal p-th\npower called the Frobenius map. A non-antisymmetric version of Lie algebras has\nbeen introduced by the second author in [8] under the name Leibniz algebras. In\n[2] Dzhumadil'daev and S.A. Abdykassymova introduced the notion of restricted\nLeibniz algebra in characteristic p.\nIt is well-known that an associative algebra gives rise to a restricted Lie algebra\nby taking the p-th power as Frobenius map. In the Leibniz case, we prove that the\nLeibniz algebra associated to a diassociative algebra is in fact a restricted Leibniz\nalgebra.\nIn the Lie case, the functor from associative algebras to restricted Lie algebras\nadmits a left adjoint Up and it is known that, for a restricted Lie algebra g, the\nassociative algebra Up (g) classifies the restricted Lie modules over g. In the Leibniz\ncase, these two roles of Up are played by two different objects. First, we prove that\nthe restricted enveloping diassociative algebra U dp (g) provides a functor which is\nleft adjoint to the forgetful functor. Second, we show that the restricted Leibniz gmodules are classified by an associative algebra U Lp (g) that we construct explicitly.\nIn the last part we show that the tensor product of a Leibniz algebra and a Zinbiel\nalgebra (dual notion for Koszul duality), which is known to be a Lie algebra, has a\nfiner structure: it is a pre-Lie algebra. This result is valid in any characteristic. In\ncharacteristic p it turns out that this pre-Lie algebra is in fact a restricted pre-Lie\nalgebra in the sense of Dzhumadil'daev, cf. [3].\nWe thank Bruno Vallette for a careful reading of a first version of this paper.\nIn this paper we denote by k a field of prime characteristic p except at the\nbeginning of section 4 where no characteristic hypothesis is made.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Diassociative algebras and restricted Leibniz algebras.\nA Leibniz algebra is a non-commutative version of Lie algebra. Thus, before we\nproceed with Leibniz algebras let us recall some facts in the Lie framework which\nled N. Jacobson to introduce the notion of restricted Lie algebra. In many cases\nin which Lie algebras arise naturally in prime characteristic one finds structures\nricher than the ordinary Lie algebras. For example, any associative algebra A over\nk gives rise to a pair (ALie , [p]) where ALie is the Lie algebra with bracket given by\n[a, b] := ab \u2212 ba where a, b \u2208 A and [p] : ALie \u2192 ALie is the 'Frobenius mapping'\na 7\u2192 ap . Another example is obtained by considering the Lie algebra Der(U) of\nderivations of a not necessarily associative algebra U over k. It can be proved (see\n[7]) that Der(U) is closed under the map [p] : D 7\u2192 Dp where D \u2208 Der(U) and the\nmap [p] verifies specific relations. These facts lead to the following definition.\n1.1. Definition [7]. A restricted Lie algebra is a pair (L, [p]) where L is a Lie\nalgebra over k and [p] : L \u2192 L, x 7\u2192 x[p] is map which satisfies the following\nrelations:\n(\u03b1x)[p]\n\n=\n\n[x, y [p] ] =\n\n\u03b1p x[p] , \u03b1 \u2208 k, x \u2208 L\n[* * * [x, y ], y ] * * * , y ], x, y \u2208 L\n{z\n}\n|\np\n\n(x + y)[p]\n\n=\n\nx[p] + y [p] +\n\ni=p\u22121\nX\n\nsi (x, y),\n\ni=1\n\nwhere isi (x, y) is the coefficient of \u03bbi\u22121 in [* * * [x, (\u03bbx + y) ], (\u03bbx + y) ] * * * , (\u03bbx + y) ].\n{z\n}\n|\np\u22121\n\nA restricted morphism f : L1 \u2192 L2 is a Lie morphism such that f (x[p] ) = f (x)[p] .\nWe denote by p-Lie the category of restricted Lie algebras.\n\n1.2. Example [7]. Any associative algebra A over k has the structure of restricted\nalgebra with p-map given by a 7\u2192 ap . In particular, from the Leibniz rule we obtain\nthat the derivation algebra Der(U) \u2282 gl(U) of a not necessarily associative algebra\nU is a restricted Lie algebra.\nLet L be a restricted Lie algebra, and let U (L) be the universal enveloping\nalgebra of L. The universal restricted enveloping algebra is defined by Up (L) :=\nU (L)/{xp \u2212 x[p] | x \u2208 L}. A module over Up (L) is called restricted Lie module.\nFrom example 1.2 above we see that there is a functor Ass \u2192 p-Lie. The left\nadjoint of this functor is the restricted enveloping functor Up (L). A natural question\nwhich arises is wether there is an analogous statement in the Leibniz framework\nin prime characteristic. Let us now recall the notion of Leibniz algebra, for more\ndetails about Leibniz algebras the reader could consult [8],[11].\n1.3. Definition. A Leibniz algebra over k is a k-module g equipped with a bilinear\nmap, called bracket,\n[\u2212, \u2212 ] : g \u00d7 g \u2192 g\nsatisfying the Leibniz identity :\n[x, [y, z ] ] = [ [x, y ], z ] \u2212 [ [x, z ], y ],\nfor all x, y, z \u2208 g\nWe denote by Leib the category of Leibniz algebras over k.\n\n\fON RESTRICTED LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\n1.4. Example. Any Lie algebra is a Leibniz algebra.\nWhen we replace Lie algebras by Leibniz algebras the role of associative algebras\nis played by the diassociative algebras (see [10]). We recall the definition:\n1.5. Definitions. A diassociative algebra is a k-module D equipped with two\nk-linear maps \u22a3, \u22a2: D \u2297 D \u2192 D called respectively the left product and the\nright product such that the products \u22a3 and \u22a2 are associative and satisfy the following relations:\n(1)\n(2)\n\nx \u22a3 (y \u22a3 z) =\n(x \u22a2 y) \u22a3 z =\n\nx \u22a3 (y \u22a2 z),\nx \u22a2 (y \u22a3 z),\n\n(3)\n\n(x \u22a3 y) \u22a2 z\n\n(x \u22a2 y) \u22a2 z.\n\n=\n\nLet D and D\u2032 be diassociative algebras. A morphism of diassociative algebras\nf : D \u2192 D\u2032 is a k-linear map such that:\nf (x \u22a3 y) = f (x) \u22a3 f (y) and f (x \u22a2 y) = f (x) \u22a2 f (y)\nfor all x, y \u2208 D.\nThe category of diassociative algebras over k is denoted by Dias.\nProposition 1.6. Let D be a diassociative algebra. Then D endowed with the\nfollowing bracket\n[x, y ] := x \u22a3 y \u2212 y \u22a2 x\nis a Leibniz algebra, denoted by DLeib .\nProof. See proposition 4.2 in [10].\nHere we would like to note that in the Lie context the solution of many problems\nin prime characteristic requires only the knowledge of whether a p-map can be\nintroduced in a given Lie algebra L over k. This led to the concept of restrictable\nLie algebras (see [12]). In particular a Lie algebra L over k is called restrictable if\n(Ad x)p is an inner derivation for all x \u2208 L (here Ad x(y) = [y, x]). In other words\nfor all x \u2208 L there exist x[p] \u2208 L such that (Ad x)p = (Ad x[p] ). From Theorem 11\nin [7] we obtain that a Lie algebra L is restrictable if and only if there is a p-map\n[p] : L \u2192 L which makes L a restricted Lie algebra.\nIn [2] A.S Dzhumadil'daev and S.A. Abdykassymova introduce an analogue of the\nnotion of restrictable Lie algebra in the Leibniz framework. They call it restricted\nLeibniz algebra, and we keep their terminology.\n1.7. Notation. Let g be a Leibniz algebra, we denote by rx : g \u2192 g the right\nmultiplication operator given by rx (y) := [y, x ] for all x, y \u2208 g.\n1.8. Definition [2]. A restricted Leibniz algebra is a pair (g, [p]) where g is a Leibniz\nalgebra g over k, and [p] : g \u2192 g, x 7\u2192 x[p] is a map (called the p-map) such that\nrxp = rx[p] for all x \u2208 g.\nLet (g, [p]) and (h, [p]) be restricted Leibniz algebras. A restricted morphism\nf : g \u2192 h is a Leibniz morphism such that f (x[p] ) = f (x)[p] for all x \u2208 g. We\ndenote the category of restricted Leibniz algebras over k by p-Leib.\n\n\f4\n\nIOANNIS DOKAS AND JEAN-LOUIS LODAY\n\n1.9. Example. Any restricted Lie algebra is restricted as a Leibniz algebra.\nThe next theorem shows that the associated Leibniz algebra DLeib of a diassociative algebra D over k has the structure of restricted Leibniz algebra. We first\nprove a technical lemma.\nLemma 1.10. If D is a diassociative algebra then we have\nx \u22a3 (* * * (y \u22a3 y) \u22a3 y) * * * ) \u22a3 y) = x \u22a3 (* * * (y \u22a2 y) \u22a2 y) * * * ) \u22a2 y )\n|\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nn\n\nn\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 D and n \u2265 1. We adopt the notation y\n\n\u22a3n\n\n:= (* * * (y \u22a3 y) \u22a3 y) * * * ) \u22a3 y\n{z\n}\n|\nn\n\nand y \u22a2 n := (* * * (y \u22a2 y) \u22a2 y) * * * ) \u22a2 y .\n|\n{z\n}\nn\n\nProof. In order to prove the identity we proceed by induction on n. For n = 2\nthis identity follows from axiom (1) of the definition 1.5. We suppose that the\nrelation is true for n. Then x \u22a3 y \u22a3 (n+1) = x \u22a3 (y \u22a3 n \u22a3 y) = (x \u22a3 y \u22a3 n ) \u22a3 y. By\ninduction hypothesis we get (x \u22a3 y \u22a3 n ) \u22a3 y = (x \u22a3 y \u22a2 n ) \u22a3 y = x \u22a3 (y \u22a2 n \u22a3 y).\nFinally, by axiom (1) of the definition 1.5, we obtain that x \u22a3 (y \u22a2 n \u22a2 y) = x \u22a3\ny \u22a2 (n+1) .\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.11. Let D be a diassociative algebra over k. If [p] : D \u2192 D is the map\ngiven by x \u2192 x\u22a2 p , then (DLeib , [p]) is a restricted Leibniz algebra.\nProof. For all y \u2208 D we will denote by Ry\u22a3 , L\u22a2y : D \u2192 D the maps defined\nrespectively by Ry\u22a3 (x) := x \u22a3 y and L\u22a2y (x) := y \u22a2 x. The Leibniz bracket, with\nthis notation, is given by [x, y ] = (Ry\u22a3 \u2212 L\u22a2y )(x) for all x, y \u2208 D. Moreover, from\nrelation (2) of the definition 1.5 we have that Ry\u22a3 L\u22a2y = L\u22a2y Ry\u22a3 .

Then we define actions of gl and gr\nrespectively by:\nm * lx := [x, m], and m * rx := [m, x].\nfor all m \u2208 M and x, y \u2208 g. These actions are extended by composition and linearity\nto an action of T (gl \u2295 gr ). Since M is a restricted g-module it is in particular a\nLeibniz g-module, therefore the elements of type (8), (9), (10) act trivially. Besides,\nfrom axiom (7) elements of type (11) act trivially as well. Therefore M is endowed\nwith the structure of right U Lp (g)-module.\nConversely, let M be a right U Lp (g)-module.
