This essay not only reflects the research results\nof our participants-universities in more than four years, but also includes valuable\nopinions of many colleagues in the mathematical education circle.\n\n2.\n\nReform situation of the university mathematics education in China and the main problems\nexisting\n\nFor the past half a century, our modern university education, accompanying\nthe progress process of our socialist political and economic development, experiencing the stage of \"learning from the Soviet Union in all respects\", many times of\n\"educational reforms\" and today's \"reform and opening to the world\", has grown\nin wave-like development and formed today's scale. In this process, the teaching\nreform on the university non-mathematics class specialties higher mathematics has\nalmost not been stopped. It can be said that mathematics teaching in this period,\ngenerally speaking, adapted itself to the requirements for training professionals in\nvarious fields under the planned economic system and made important contributions\nfor the society. In this respect, several generations of educators of mathematical\nteaching devoted their wisdom and hardworking.\nHistorically, the focus of the reform of the university mathematical education\nin China is always concentrated on the problem of the combination of mathematics\nwith practice. In a long period before the reforms and opening to the world, the\nbasic task of the non-mathematics class specialties mathematical teaching is for\nspecialties, or mathematics courses should serve courses of specialties. As mentioned\nearlier, in the tendency of the extreme situation of putting too much emphasis on\nspecialties, such a saying is natural; but we went even further. In addition, we\nwere in a situation of long-period of isolation. We didn't know the situation of\nmathematics education in other countries, even were not clear on the reform in\nthe Soviet Union. Without comparison, it is difficult to discover the problems.\nMoreover, different opinions on such a problem as \"the relationship between the\nteaching of fundamental mathematics and that of specialties,\" should have been\na problem of academic views in the first place and can be discussed and tested;\nbut such opinions were always improperly treated as ideological problems even the\npolitical ones. Therefore, it was difficult to express different views. Since the 1980s,\nour policies of the reform and opening to the world have brought spring for the\neducational reforms. When we learned of the changes in those decades of years,\nwe realized that we had lagged behind and we should do our best to catch up.\nAt that time, people found that, as a developing country, China was confronted\nwith a series of serious challenges in the socialist market economy. In addition, the\nrapid appearance of the knowledge economy based on the intelligent resources and\ninnovative competition, we are forced to reconsider problems, such as educational\nconcepts, teaching systems, course systems, teaching content and methods etc.,\nwhich are formed in the original planned economy.\nViewing from the angle of the university mathematics education, the existing\n\n\fReforms of the University Mathematics * * *\n\n899\n\nmain problems may be summarized as follows:\nFirst, the \"specialty education\" is overemphasized and thus a one-sided understanding of the role of the university mathematics education \"serving specialties\"\nis formed. Such an understanding, as the guiding idea of education, is embodied\nin every link of teaching. Due to its long duration, the depth and extension of its\neffects cannot be underestimated. Even now, among quite a large part of teaching\ncadres and teachers, such an understanding may still work, because in the past the\nproblem of \"what is the role of university mathematical courses in the university\neducation\" had not been studied properly.\nSecondly, as the cultivation target was training \"specialists and engineers who\ncould work directly after their graduation,\" the teaching process was speeded up.\nMoreover, we have the tradition of putting emphasis on the classroom teaching,\nand the course of mathematics itself has its own specific strict logical system, the\ninstillation-type of teaching methods can be said to be deep-rooted.\nThirdly, as mathematics teachers of non-mathematical class specialties usually undertake heavy teaching tasks, and in the technological and engineering colleges and universities, the mathematical scientific research not being combined with\npractice directly is viewed as being isolated from practice, the teachers engaged in\nteaching basic courses of mathematics have not touched scientific research for a long\ntime. Under this situation it is difficult to improve their professional skills and their\nteaching levels.\nThese problems, facing the serious challenges of the 21st century, cause the\ninadaptability of the university mathematics education to the current education\ndevelopment situation to be more serious. The results are mainly reflected in the\nfollowing respects.\nFor students, too specific majors and their one-sided understanding of the\nrole of basic courses lead to their narrow scopes of knowledge (especially knowledge\non mathematics), narrow field of vision, lack of creation and all this is usually\nexpressed in insufficient \"aftereffects\".\nFor teachers, a single- pattern course content, rigid teaching plans and programs lead to the fact that they could only be responsible for textbooks and exams\nand it is difficult for them to attend to the cultivation of abilities and qualities\nof students. The development of teachers' active roles and their growth are both\ninfluenced.\nFor textbooks, most of the content is rather old and their system is stereotyped. There is no mechanism to encourage teachers to edit new teaching textbooks\nand materials, which gives people an impression of \"one thousand people having\none face\" and results in difficulties for students to grasp mathematical thinking and\nmethod and to learn new knowledge in mathematics.\n\n3.\n\nSeveral aspects that should be grasped in doing\na good job of our college mathematics education\n\nIn recent years, with the rapid development of our economy, higher education\nin our country has met with an excellent situation of brisk discussions and great\n\n\f900\n\nShutie Xiao\n\nreforms. This time of educational reform, whether from the emphasis degree of the\ngovernment, or from the realistic spirit of policies, the strength of the funds input\nand the depth and breadth of studying problems, they are all unprecedented. Just\nas the case in previous educational reforms, the reform of mathematics teaching is\nstill among one of the key problems. What is different from the past is that the\nreform is not restricted to the long confusing problem of the relationship between\nmathematics and practice, but rather, the mathematics education is first put under the background of social development and is raised at the height of university\nquality education. The past is reviewed, the present is examined and the future is\nplanned. In particular, the role of mathematics education in higher education has\nbeen clarified. There emerge schemes, new textbooks and new courses on mathematics course content, structure and system reforms that have creative intention\nand face the epoch. The research and practice on reforming teaching methods of\nmathematics and introducing new means of teaching have attracted the attention of\nbroad masses of mathematics teachers; but the development is not balanced. There\nis not enough systematic research and comprehensive experiments. Especially, viewing from the great part of the circle, there are no great changes of the traditional\nmathematics teaching modes and methods. As for the renewal of the teaching content of mathematics, it is like \"walking with the unsteady steps.\" The main problem\nstill lies in the change of educational ideology and teaching concepts. For the teaching of the basic mathematical courses in non-mathematics class specialties, in our\nopinion, it is necessary to clarify the following points in understanding.\n(1) It is necessary to have a rather comprehensive knowledge of the\nrole of mathematics education in university\nIn the educational mode in the planned economy, training of professionals in\nuniversities was of an upside-down type. The national plan decided the arrangement\nof specialties, and teaching programs were drawn up according to the requirements\nof specialties. Courses were arranged according to the procedure of specialty courses\n- fundamental specialty courses - basic courses. It was emphasized that the latter\nshall serve the former. For the basic education of mathematics, the excessive emphasis of the aspect of \"serving specialties\", and the neglect of the inherent unity of\nmathematics as a rational reasoning system and the specific role of mathematics in\nthe comprehensive quality of students, led to the lack of a comprehensive knowledge\nof the role of mathematics education in university education. In fact, mathematics\nis the common foundation for cultivating and training various levels of special professionals. For students of non-mathematics class specialties, the role of university\nbasic mathematics courses lies at least in the following three aspects.\nIt is the main course for students to grasp mathematical tools. Such\na role is very important for students of non-mathematics class specialties and is an\nimportant content of \"specialty quality.\" The current problems are as follows: on\nthe one hand, teachers should study how to effectively enable students to grasp and\nuse this tool in the whole course of mathematical teaching and how to lay a foundation in this field in the stage of basic courses; on the other hand, it is necessary to\nprevent the narrow understanding of \"tool\", viewing the basic mathematics course\nonly as the tool for serving certain specialty courses, and even the tool specifically\n\n\fReforms of the University Mathematics * * *\n\n901\n\nfor dealing with certain examinations.\nIt is an important carrier for students to cultivate their rational\nthinking. What mathematics studies is the model structures of \"numerals\" and\n\"forms\", and what it uses is such rational thinking methods as logic, reasoning\nand deduction. Large amounts of facts show that it is not a useless theory that is\n\"isolated from practice\", but is a thinking creation, which originates from practice\nand guides practice. The role of such a training of rational thinking could hardly\nbe replaced by other courses. Such a cultivation of rational thinking is of utmost\nimportance for students to improve their quality, to enhance their analytical abilities\nand to enlighten their creation consciousness. The current problems lie in that we\nlack the mature teaching experience and excellent textbooks in this respect.\nIt is a way for students to receive the nurture of beauty sense. The\nmathematical aesthetics is part of people's quality of the appreciation of beauty.\nWith the development of human civilization and the progress of science, such a fact\nis being gradually recognized by people. In fact, targets mathematics is striving\nfor - the arrangement of chaos into order, the sublimation of experience to laws\nand the search for the concise and uniform mathematical expression of motions\nof substances - are the embodiment of mathematical beauty, and are also man's\npursuit for beauty sense. Such a pursuit acts as a subtle influence for the nurture of\nman's mental world and is always a motive force of innovation. At present we can\nonly say that it is necessary to pay attention to the role of mathematics in aesthetic\neducation. And further search and attempts should be made in its embodiment in\nteaching and textbooks.\nThe roles of the three aspects are unified, but in concrete requirements, according to the different kinds of colleges, specialties and students, there should\nbe different sides to be emphasized, so that the comprehensive realization of the\nknowledge, abilities and quality in mathematics teaching can be expected.\n(2) Emphasis should be put on the solution of problems of the renewal of college mathematics course system and content\nFrom the abolition of the imperial civil examination system at the end of Qing\nDynasty, the establishment of modern school and up to the liberation of China, the\neducation of science and technology in colleges and universities basically followed\nmodes in Europe and America. For the content of mathematical teaching, before\nthe 1950s, mathematics as a compulsory course in most specialties of science and\ntechnology except in few specialties, such as physics, was only limited to simple\ncalculus and differential equations. In the 1950s, the Soviet modes were comprehensively introduced in higher education institutes. A kind of specialty education\nwith the aim of training professional talents according to requirements of the trades\nwas formed. The arrangement of the courses in the specialties was aimed at the requirements of the professional knowledge. Basic courses such as mathematics were\nrequired to serve specialty courses. Such a system and guiding ideas have actually\ncontinued till now. Though in the 1980s, due to the need to employ computers,\nlinear algebra (taking calculation as the chief content) and numerical methods became compulsory mathematics courses, viewing from the guiding ideas, the main\npoint was still \"specialty education\" and the changes of teaching content were very\n\n\f902\n\nShutie Xiao\n\nlimited. Later, there occurred improper evaluations, in addition to the influences\nof \"examination-oriented education\" induced by taking the post-graduate entrance\nexaminations, the tendency of one-sided pursuit of the problem-solving techniques\nwas promoted. As a result, the train of thought about reforms became more vague.\nHowever, due to the rapid development of the computer technique in the later half\nof last century, people had more knowledge on the role of modern mathematics.\nEspecially in the recent 30 years, there appears the so-called \"modern mathematics\ntechnique\" which displays its prowess fully in economy and industries. For example, optimization, engineering control, information processing, fuzzy recognition\nand image reconstruction, etc. they are produced due to the combination of the\nprinciples and methods of modern mathematics with computers. They penetrate\nand are applied in all sectors and trades, and are combined with relevant techniques\nto form the so-called high and new techniques in those areas. In current developed\ncountries, mathematics is applied to improve the organizational level of economy,\nand from drawing up macroscopic strategic planning to the storage, distribution\nand transportation of products and to the market prediction, analysis of finance\nand insurance businesses, significant progress has been attained. All the facts mentioned above mean that mathematics has turned from part of the traditional natural\nsciences and engineering techniques to further penetrating into many areas of the\nmodern society and economy and has gradually become one of their indispensable\ncolumns. On the other hand, the development of science and technology brings\nabout a series of problems and it is necessary for people to reexamine the relationship between man and society and between man and Nature in a rational way. All\nthis requires that training on the tool property and rationality should be emphasized in college mathematics education. Therefore, it is an urgent task to adjust\nthe basic course system of college mathematics and appropriately renew teaching\ncontent.\n(3) Reforming the examination-oriented \"instillation-type\" teaching\nIn recent years, various kinds of factors have induced a type of examinationoriented teaching. Marks play almost decisive roles for students in many respects\nsuch as evaluation in the prizes, graduate entrance examinations and the assignment\nfor jobs. In some occasions, students' marks are the main factor for evaluating\nteachers. Such a situation causes teachers to teach for exams and students study\nfor exams. In order to raise the average marks of a class, teachers spend a lot of\ntime and energy on the teaching of problem patterns. Accordingly, the \"instillationtype\" of teaching methods are in a dominating position in our college teaching.\nCharacteristics of such methods are as follows: on the one hand, various kinds of\nproblem patterns are explained in every detail in the classroom and efforts are made\nto enable students to understand them as soon as they listen to the explanations.\nIn such a way, besides the small amount of classroom information quantity, the\npsychology of dependence of the students will certainly be enhanced and they will\nhave a bad habit of being lazy in thinking, which will seriously hinder the cultivation\nof the innovation sense and innovation capability. On the other hand, students\nare busy problem solving after the class and problems are substituting learning.\nThey rarely read books and pay little attention to the mathematical thinking and\n\n\fReforms of the University Mathematics * * *\n\n903\n\nmathematical applications, let alone the cultivation of the innovation sense.\n(4) Devoting great efforts to the construction of teachers' teams\nThis is the crux matter of our reform. In recent years, compared to the past,\nthe situation of teachers' teams engaged in non-mathematics class specialty mathematics teaching has turned to the better. Quite a few of young teachers who have\nobtained Doctor's degrees join the career. In common colleges and universities,\nproportions of mathematics teachers who have gained Master's degrees are increasing. This is an encouraging phenomenon, indicating that there will be qualified\nsuccessors to carry on mathematics teaching, but the authorities of colleges and\nuniversities have not timely put such a strategic task at a deserved height. For\nexample, knowing clearly that the experienced teachers with high academic levels\nshould be appointed to teach the basic courses, some colleges and universities still\nclassify the teachers according to the order of the postgraduate teaching, senior\nstudents teaching, and the basic courses teaching. Such a guiding direction is very\nunfavorable for cultivating high-quality talents. In addition, viewing from the young\nteachers' teams, there also exists something worrying. First, their ideas are not so\nstable; secondly, they cannot deal well with the relationship between scientific research and teaching. In the key universities, there usually exists the atmosphere\nof paying more attention to scientific research than that to teaching. In common\ncolleges and universities, there always exists the problem of only teaching without scientific research. Therefore, creating certain conditions and asking the young\nteachers to participate in scientific research are important measures to improve the\nlevels of college mathematics teachers. Thirdly, not enough efforts have been made\nin conducting education on teacher morality and on superior teaching traditions for\nthe young teachers.\n\n4.\n\nSeveral important relationships in the university mathematics education reforms\n\nThe college mathematics education reform is a very careful job. The treatment\nof many problems in this respect will not only rely on principles, but also be flexible. According to the experience and lessons from the past mathematics education\nreform, I would like to discuss some problems concerning principles in mathematics\nteaching reform from the correct treatment of the relationships in several aspects\nas follows:\n(1) Embodying quality education, paying attention to well treating\nthe relationships between knowledge impartment and quality cultivation\nIn recent years, there are a large amount of discussions on \"quality\" and \"quality education\". We assume that quality is a mental and physical attribute expressed\nwhen people understand and treat things and events. It is based on the congenital\npsychological conditions and is gradually formed under the influences of the postnatal environment. Viewing from the angle of education, an individual's quality\nin a certain aspect is shown in his power of understanding and potential energy in\nsuch an aspect. Quality education is a process during which excellent qualities of\npeople are cast through the smelting of systematic knowledge. Any objective ex-\n\n\f904\n\nShutie Xiao\n\nistence in the world has its attribute characters of \"numerals\" and \"forms\". With\nthe progress of the science of mathematics, people's knowledge of \"numerals\" and\n\"forms\" has enhanced from directly-visual quantity relationships and space forms\nto the abstract \"mathematical structures\" and \"space concepts\" with deeper connotation and wider extension. Such attributes of \"numerals\" and \"forms\" in people's\nunderstanding things and their comprehension and potential ability in handling the\ncorresponding relationships are obviously a kind of people's quality and we call such\na quality mathematical quality. Under the background of the tendency of digitalization and informationalization in the knowledge economy society, the importance\nof possessing such a quality is very great. In the quality education, viewing from\nthe main body of education (i.e. the main targets of education and corresponding\nteaching behaviors), the soul of the college mathematics education is exactly the\nmathematical quality, and is what has been discussed in the previous part - quality property. Viewing from mathematics itself, especially the modern mathematics,\nits essence is a rational thinking system extracted abstractly from large amounts\nof objective phenomena. Therefore, in its education, besides displaying how it absorbs nutrition from laws of vivid objective things and provides tools, main focus is\nthe training of the rational thinking techniques and of the mastering mathematical\ntools. That is the content of the education of mathematical quality. Though it\nimparts \"knowledge\" as well, \"knowledge\" of mathematics acts as a carrier of imparting quality (such a role was always neglected by people in the past), besides one\nside that it is combined with the material content and thus acts as a tool to serve\nother disciplines. The quality education in the mathematical teaching is that the\nteachers put the lively and rational ways of thinking via the knowledge carrier to\nimplement the motivational, psychological and mental guidance for their students.\nMathematics has become a fundamental component of the culture of the contemporary social culture via its ability of tools, rational spirit and sense of beauty.\nIn the society of the 21st century if one has no idea what mathematical technology\nmeans, lacks both the rational thinking and the sense of beauty appreciation; then\nhis total quality will be affected. His abilities in insight, judgement and originality\nwould be greatly restricted. Therefore, the accomplishment of mathematical culture\nis not a kind of \"fashion\" for one in the ever-increasingly fierce competition among\ntalents of the society; it is indeed a kind of actual necessity for one in his work,\nstudy and social communication.\nThe specific content of the mathematical quality is quite rich, the most outstanding specific characteristics that are generally acknowledged are summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022 The sharp consciousness of extracting the attributes of \"numerals and forms\"\nof things.\n\u2022 Thinking mode of using \"abstract models and structures\" to study things.\n\u2022 Exploring habits of conducting compact deduction by means of signs and\nlogical systems.\nFeatures of mathematical qualities in these aspects are connected with each\nother and cannot be separated in the actual educational processes. All college students should be cultivated and educated in such aspects. Of course, the education\n\n\fReforms of the University Mathematics * * *\n\n905\n\nand cultivation of mathematical qualities are different in emphasis points, depth,\nand breadth between mathematics major students and non-mathematics class specialties students, and in non-mathematics class specialties, such differences do exist\nbetween students of science, engineering, agriculture and medicine and those of\nhumanities majors.\n(2) Grasping course systems and content renewal and treating well\nrelationships between the inherence and modernization of the mathematical knowledge\nThe main body of the textbooks of current basic mathematics courses is mostly\nmathematics before the 19th century. This is in contrast with other basic textbooks\nof physics, chemistry and biology that began mostly from the 19th century. Therefore, the problem of the modernization of basic university mathematics textbooks\nis to be stressed. But we should be cautious in this problem. It is unavoidable\nto appropriately add the commonly accepted and fundamental content of modern\nmathematics; but it is necessary to consider another aspect: as we have mentioned\nabove, mathematics is a kind of thinking science and has its own specialties. Its\nsystem is constructed by logic and is a structure of series established one layer after\nanother from the bottom to the top. The mathematical knowledge important in\nthe past is the \"logical basis\" of the current mathematics and throwing away the\nformer will influence the later studies. For example, calculus has a history of over\nthree hundred years, but it still is the foundation stone of modern mathematics\nand can't be thrown away casually. Such a situation differs from other sciences.\nFor other sciences, if the theories before the 19th century are out-of-date, they\ncan be cancelled, though proceeding and subsequent knowledge has inherent property. The preceding knowledge is not necessarily the direct logical foundation of\nthe subsequent knowledge, so the abandonment of the preceding knowledge will not\ninfluence the learning of the subsequent knowledge. In addition, there is still an\nimportant reason. Such a part of mathematics content, for example, calculus, has\nstill a rather wide application today. Therefore the idea of \"modernization\" of the\ncontent of college mathematics textbooks is somewhat different from the modernization of other disciplines and thus how much modern content has been listed in\nthe textbook cannot be simply taken as the standard of measurement. We assume\nthat the content modernization of the college mathematics textbooks can mainly\ninclude the following aspects. First, the classical mathematics content should be\ngoverned by viewpoints and languages of modern mathematics as far as possible; at\nthe same time \"roots\" in the classical mathematics for some modern mathematics\nshould be appropriately introduced. Secondly, significant results of modern mathematics that have formed the basic part of relevant disciplines should be put into\ntextbooks as far as possible and a poplar introduction should be made. Lastly, it is\nnecessary for students to possess essential basis of modern mathematics necessary\nfor students to further study relevant specialties by themselves.\nWhat is similarly important is to cancel some contents such as reasoning loaded\ndown with trivial details and those calculations that can be done by calculators,\nand concepts and methods that are relatively old and thus have no development\nprospect in modern science. In summary, facing an accumulation of nearly two\n\n\f906\n\nShutie Xiao\n\ncenturies, how to deal with the \"metabolism\" of the basic content of mathematics\nis a quite difficult problem. Depending only on \"outside extension type\" to increase\nacademic hours will not work and efforts should be made on reforms on the structure\nand content of the course.\n(3) Paying attention to the reform of teaching methods and handling\nwell relationships between teachers' guidance and students' initiative\nOnce the teaching system and content of the course of college mathematics\nhave been determined, teaching methods become the key problem of teaching quality. Obviously, the teaching process of basic mathematics is absolutely not man's\nrepetition of cognition processes for numerals and forms laws, but basic laws of\ncognition processes should be observed. In addition, the teaching process cannot be\nthe simulation of research process of mathematical problems, but should embody\nresearch methods and thinking modes specific for mathematics. The teaching of\nmathematics includes two sides of teaching and learning and is a comprehensive\nprocess in which many teaching activities guided by teachers lead to the initiative\nof students to study mathematics. The so-called initiative has at least the following\nmeanings. First, students have the interest and dynamic force to learn mathematics.\nSecondly, students can learn by themselves under the proper guidance of teachers.\nThirdly, students can work at and put forward problems independently during the\nstudy process. Fourthly, students can use the knowledge their teachers impart and\nrelated knowledge gained through self-study after processing and digestion to construct a knowledge system that, even if it is simple and not perfect, actually belongs\nto themselves.\n(4) Emphasizing the practical links of mathematics and paying attention to handling well relationships between mathematical basic training and mathematical application consciousness and ability cultivation\nThe widespread use of computers and the emergence of a series of powerful\nmathematical software systems have resulted in profound changes in the roles of\nmathematics and in mathematical teaching. They make it possible to collect and\nprocess large amounts of data, also make mathematical model a means of experiment, and thus greatly promote applications of mathematics in all fields. The\ncombination of mathematical thinking with computers has become an important\nmode of modern mathematical teaching. For example, since the establishment of\nthe course of \"mathematical models\" in colleges in the 1980s, there have been hundreds of colleges and universities where this course has been set up, and the course is\na favorite of students. Especially the annual national contest of college mathematics model-building attracts students of various specialties and promotes reforms in\nmathematics teaching. At present, the course \"mathematical experiments\" aiming\nat strengthening practice links of mathematics is being tested in several colleges\nand universities and the preliminary results are encouraging.\n\n\f"}
