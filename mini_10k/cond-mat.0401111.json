In a\nquantum wire, its width is so narrow that electron waves\nare strongly confined in the transverse direction and their\ntransverse momentums are quantized. In a ballistic conduction of electrons through a quantum point contact\nwith width comparable to the Fermi wavelength, a steplike structure with step of 2e2 /h appears in the conductance as a function of Fermi energy or width [1\u20133].\nOne of the fundamental consequences of superconductivity is the Andreev reflection at the interface of a\nnormal-metal and a superconductor (SC) [4,5]. This phenomenon corresponds to an incoming electron from the\nnormal side being reflected as a hole, thereby adding a\nCooper pair in the superconducting condensate. In a\ntunnel junction of a normal-metal and a (110) oriented\nd-wave SC, the zero bias conductance peak appears due\nto the formation of the Andreev bound state at the interface [6,7]. However, when a single quantum wire of a\nsingle conducting channel is in contact with d-wave SC\nof the (110) oriented surface, the Andreev reflection is\ncompletely suppressed due to the quantum mechanical\ndiffraction of electron waves at the narrow opening [8].\nA basic question arises what happens if two quantum\nwires are in contact to the (110) oriented d-wave SC (see\nFig. 1). When an electron is injected into SC from one\nof the wires, there is a possibility that the Andreev hole\nis reflected back into another wire due to the non-local\neffect called the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) [9,10],\nthus providing an ideal system to study CAR.\nIn this Letter, we explore quantum-interference effects\ndue to the crossed Andreev reflection in a d-wave SC with\ntwo quantum wires that are parallel and placed close to\neach other. It is shown that the resonance peak in the\nconductance is split into two sharp peaks at low energies\nwhen the barrier potential of the contact is sufficiently\nlarge. The lower and higher energy peaks correspond to\nthe bonding and the antibonding Andreev bound states,\nrespectively. This suggests that these Andreev levels\n\nform a two-level quantum system (qubit), whose population can be controlled by application of bias voltage\nand/or electromagnetic field, exhibiting a coherent oscillation of the Andreev qubit (Rabi oscillation).\nWe examine the quantum transport in a hybrid nanostructure of a d-wave SC and two normal-conducting\nquantum wires. Figure 1 shows a model structure in the\nx-y plane with a two-dimensional (2D) d-wave SC occupying the left half space, and two quantum wires of width\nw, lead 1 and lead 2, which are parallel along x and connected to SC at y = \u00b1L/2.

For simplicity, the Fermi wave number kF and the effective mass\nm are common for all electrodes, and the amplitude of\nthe gap function \u2206(k, r) is uniform in SC and vanishes\nin the wires. In an anisotropic SC, the pair potential\n\u2206(k, r) is a function of wave vector k, and its value is\ndefined on the Fermi surface in the direction of k.

(4) are the transmitted QP waves\non the electron-like and hole-like branches, respectively.\nIn SC of d-wave symmetry, QPs in different branches\nfeel different pair potentials, \u2206+ = \u22060 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1) and\n\u2206\u2212 = \u22060 cos 2(\u03b8 + \u03b1), where \u03b1 is the angle between the\n(100) axis of SC and the normal to the interface (see\nFig. 1), and \u03b8 = sin\u22121 (py /kF ) is the propagation angle\nrelative to the x axis.\nIn the following, we focus on the (110) oriented surface\nof SC, i.e., \u03b1 = \u03c0/4, as shown in Fig. 1. In this case, QPs\nin the electron-like and hole-like branches move in the\npair potentials\n\u2206=\np of opposite sign, \u2206\u00b1 = \u00b1\u2206, where\n\u221a\n2\u22060 (py /kF ) 1 \u2212 (py /kF )2 , and \u03a9\u00b1 = \u03a9 = E 2 \u2212 \u22062 .\nThe barrier potential at the interface between the wires\nand SC is taken into account by the \u03b4-function-type potential with amplitude (h\u03042 kF /2m)Z, Z being a dimensionless parameter [5].

Figure 2 shows the conductance G vs V for kF w = 4, kF L = 8, and different\nvalues of Z. The conductance is normalized by the normal state value GN = G(\u2206 = 0), which takes GN \u223c\n16(e2 /h)(k1 /kF )FN /Z 2 (Z \u226b 1) with FN = F (\u2206 = 0).\n2\n\n\fI\u03b3/\u03c0\nI\u03b3/\u03c0\nG\n\u2248\n+\n,\n2\n2\nGN\n(eV \u2212 E+ ) + \u03b3\n(eV \u2212 E\u2212 )2 + \u03b3 2\n\nwhere I = (\u03c0g 2 f /4FN ). The simple formula (16) reproduces the numerical result in the inset of Fig. 2, if the\ncalculated values (f = 0.405, gc = \u22120.036, gs = \u22120.0345,\nand FN = 0.68) are used in Eq. (16). Note that the peak\nheight of G/GN increases in proportion to Z 2 .\nTo elucidate the formation of the Andreev bound\nstates, we calculate the QP wave function \u03a8s (x, y) =\nt\n(\u03a8es , \u03a8hs ) in SC, where \u03a8es and \u03a8hs are the electron and\nhole wave functions, respectively. Figure 3 shows the\nmapping of the absolute squares, |\u03a8es |2 and |\u03a8hs |2 , at the\nresonance energies on the xy plane for kF w = 5, kF L = 8,\nand Z = 50, when an electron is incident from lead 1. It\nis clearly seen that the QP wave functions are strongly\nlocalized with very large peaks (red color) near the contacts due to the formation of the Andreev bound states,\nand that the decaying QP waves are traced to the (010)\nand (01\u03040) directions along which multiple reflections of\nelectron and hole take place. It is also seen that the\nformation of the localized states, especially the relative\nposition of the peaks with respect to the contacts, is different between the electron and hole QPs, and between\nthe resonance energies E\u00b1 . For Z \u226b 1 and around E\u00b1 ,\nthe explicit form of \u03a8s inside SC is obtained as\n\u0012 e \u0013\n\u0012 e \u0013\ni\u03b3\ni\u03b3\n\u03c8\u2212\n\u03c8+\n+\n,\n\u03a8s \u2248\nh\nh\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\nE \u2212 E\u2212 + i\u03b3\nE \u2212 E+ + i\u03b3\n\u2212\n+\n\nFIG. 2. Normalized conductance G/GN as a function of\nbias voltage V for different values of interfacial barrier parameter Z. Inset shows G/GN vs normalized voltage ZV .\nThe circles in the inset are calculated from Eq. (16).\n\nFor a low barrier potential of small Z, the conductance\ndecreases monotonically with decreasing eV below \u22060 .\nAs the barrier potential becomes higher, a peak structure appears well below \u22060 and shifts towards lower eV ,\ndeveloping the double peak structure with increasing Z.\nIf the conductance is plotted as a function of normalized\nvoltage ZV as shown in the inset, the conductance peaks\nfall into the same position, indicating that the resonance\npeak positions are scaled by 1/Z.\nLet us examine the origin of the double peak structure in the conductance for the tunneling case (Z \u226b 1).\nSince \u03a9 \u2248 i|\u2206| for E \u226a \u22060 , F , Gc , and Gs in Eqs. (9)(11) have the forms: F \u2248 if \u22060 /E, Gc \u2248 igc \u22060 /E,\nand Gs = igs \u22060 /E, where f = (EF /i\u22060 )E\u21920 , gc =\n(EGc /i\u22060 )E\u21920 , and gs = (EGs /i\u22060 ) are energy independent quantities, so that the Andreev reflection coefficients are calculated in the resonance forms\nig\u03b3\nig\u03b3\n+\n,\nE \u2212 E\u2212 + i\u03b3\nE \u2212 E+ + i\u03b3\nig\u03b3\nig\u03b3\n\u2248\u2212\n\u2212\n,\nE \u2212 E\u2212 + i\u03b3\nE \u2212 E+ + i\u03b3\n\neh\nr11\n\u2248\u2212\n\n(14)\n\neh\nr12\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere, except very close to the interface (x \u2248 0),\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 e \u0013\nZ\npL\n2g kF \u2206\nsin py\n\u03c8\u2212\n\u03c6(p)\ncos\nsin\nqx\ndp,\n=\nh\n\u2212 cos py\n\u03c8\u2212\n\u03c0 0 E\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 e \u0013\nZ\npL\n2g kF \u2206\ncos py\n\u03c8+\n\u03c6(p) sin\nsin qx\ndp,\n=\nh\nsin py\n\u03c8+\n\u03c0 0 E\n2\np\nwith q = kF2 \u2212 p2 and \u2206 = 2\u22060 pq/kF2 . At lower resonance energy E\u2212 , \u03a8s is dominated by the first term\ne\nh\nwhose electron (hole) wave function \u03c8\u2212\n(\u03c8\u2212\n) is an odd\n(even) function of y. At higher resonance energy E+ , \u03a8s\nis dominated by the second term whose electron (hole)\ne\nh\nwave function \u03c8+\n(\u03c8+\n) is an even (odd) function of y.\nThese results indicate that the electron (hole) wave functions at the lower and higher bound states have different\nparity with respect to y. It is noteworthy that the Andreev holes are reflected back into leads 1 and 2 in phase\nat E\u2212 and out of phase at E+ (cf. Eqs. (14) and (15)).\nThe Andreev bound states appeared in the present system have the following implication. When the interface\nbarrier potential is very high (Z \u226b 1), the current flows\nthrough the system via the Andreev bound states with\nvery sharp energy levels at E\u00b1 . When the bias voltage\nV is set between V\u2212 = E\u2212 /e and V+ = E+ /e of the conductance peaks, the lower bound state at E\u2212 is occupied\nby Andreev quasiparticles while the higher-energy bound\nstate at E+ is empty; the lower bound state is viewed as\n\nwhere g = gs /2f , E\u00b1 = (f \u00b1 |gc | + gs2 /2f )\u22060 /Z, and\nee\n\u03b3 = (k1 /kF )f \u22060 /Z 2 . The other coefficients are r11\n\u2248\neh\nee\n2\n\u22121 \u2212 gr12 and r12 \u223c O(g ). The resonance energies E\u00b1\nand intensity g depend strongly on lead separation L, exhibiting damped oscillations with the period of the Fermi\nwave length \u03bbF = 2\u03c0/kF . We note that the resonance positions E\u00b1 and their separation E+ \u2212 E\u2212 are scaled by\n1/Z, while the line width \u03b3 is scaled by 1/Z 2 . For Z \u226b 1,\nthe line width of the peaks is much smaller than the separation, and therefore a well-separated two-peak structure\nis formed as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. In this case, the\nconductance G is written as the sum of two Lorentzians\n3\n\n\fprises a d-wave superconductor and normal-conducting\nquantum wires. When a superconductor of the (110)\noriented surface is in contact with the two-leg quantum\nwires via tunnel barriers, the resonance bound states are\nformed at low energies due to the crossed Andreev reflection. As a consequence, two well-separated sharp peaks\nappear in the conductance well below the superconducting gap structure. The lower and higher conductance\npeaks correspond to the bonding and the antibonding\nAndreev bound states whose wave functions have different parity. We propose that these Andreev bound states\nform a two-level quantum system (d-wave Andreev level\nqubit), which can be controlled by application of bias\nvoltage and/or radiation of oscillating electric field.\nThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for from\nMEXT, NAREGI, and CREST, Japan.\n\n[1] B.

The Andreev bound states of electron\n(hole) QP at E\u2212 and E+ have dipole moments h1|y|0i\ndue to the different parity of the states with respect to\ny. Therefore application of the electric field eE0 cos(\u03c9t)\noscillating along y causes a significant Rabi oscillation\nwith frequency V = eE0 h1|y|0i/h\u0304 between the Andreev\nbound states, if \u03c9 is tuned to the resonance condition\n\u03c9 = E+ \u2212E\u2212 and the damping rate \u03b3 of the states is substantially smaller than h\u0304V. The significant coherence oscillation requires a smaller damping \u03b3, which is achieved\nby inserting tunnel barriers at the interfaces.
