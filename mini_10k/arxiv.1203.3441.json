Introduction\nA mesoscopic particle that is suspended in a liquid moves stochastically due to collisions\nwith the particles of the liquid \u2013 it performs Brownian motion. When two particles are\nsuspended in a liquid, they transfer momentum from and to each other via the liquid,\nhence their Brownian motion becomes correlated. This coupling of stochastic motion\nvia hydrodynamic interactions is important in biological systems as well as microfluidic\ndevices.\nRecently Zimmermann and co-workers presented a series of articles on the\ncorrelations that are induced between two trapped colloidal particles by shear flow. They\naddressed the problem experimentally [1] and theoretically [2, 3]. The experimental\nsystem consisted of uncharged polystyrene beads suspended in water in a microfluidic\ndevice that allowed to create a linear shear profile. The particles were trapped by optical\ntweezers and their positions were recorded by with high speed camera. We will refer to\nthe results of the experiments in section 4.2. In the theoretical work a Langevin model\nwas solved. We briefly introduce the model and its solutions in section 2.\nHere we present a computer simulation study on the same problem. In section\n3 we describe the simulation method, and in section 4 we compare our results to the\nexperimental and theoretical results.\n2. Equations of motion\nWe briefly review the work of Zimmermann and co-workers [2, 3]: The systems\ncondsidered here are that of one and of two hard spherical particles trapped in harmonic\npotential wells and suspended in a shear flow with a linear velocity profile. Here and in\nthe following the Brownian spheres have the same mass Mi = M and the same effective\nradii \u033ai = \u033a with i = 1, 2. Their position vectors are denoted by ri = (xi , yi , zi ). The\nisotropic potential wells Ui (ri ) = k2 (ri \u2212 qi )2 are located at q1 = (0, 0, 0) (single bead)\nand qi = (\u00b1D/2, 0, 0) (pair of beads). Here k is the strength and D is the separation of\nthe potentials. The potentials give rise to forces given by Fip = \u2212\u2207Ui . As the colloids\nare surrounded by a fluid, they experience a force F f due to the friction with the fluid\nmolecules. For small Reynolds numbers Re this force is proportional to the relative\nvelocity of the colloid and the local fluid field, Fif = \u2212\u03b6 (u \u2212 \u1e59i ), where \u03b6 = 6\u03c0\u03b7\u033a is the\nStokes friction coefficient and \u03b7 is the fluid viscosity. The linear velocity profile of the\nsheared suspension is given by u(r) = \u03b3\u0307z \u00eax with the shear rate \u03b3\u0307. We are interested\nin the case of overdamped motion, i.e. the inertial part M r\u0308i is negligible, and one can\nwrite down the Langevin equation\n\u1e59i = u(ri ) + Hij Fjp + Fis\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\nHS under shear flow\nwith the mobility matrices\n1\nH11 = H22 = I3\u00d73 ,\n\u03b6\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT\nr12 r12\n1 3\u033a\n.\nI3\u00d73 + 2\nH12 = H21 =\n\u03b6 4r12\nr12\n\n(2)\n\nhFis (t)i = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nHere, r12 := r1 \u2212 r2 is the distance vector between the two particles and its absolut\nvalue r12 = |r12 |. The last contribution in eq. (1) is the stochastic force acting on\nparticle i. For a fluid, in which orthogonal components of velocity fluctuations of the\nfluid molecules are uncorrelated, the following characteristics of Fis can be assumed:\nhFis (t)Fjs (t\u2032 )i = 2kB T Hij \u03b4 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\n\nOne can rewrite eq. (1) in a more compact form (cf. [2]) by defining the vectors\nR := (r1 , r2) and Q := (q1 , q2 ) as well as the 6 \u00d7 6 matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\nH11 H21\nH :=\n,\n(4)\nH12 H22\nand U (R) := UR, where U13 = U46 = \u03b3\u0307 and all other Ukl = 0, so that it now reads as\n\u1e58 = UR + kH (Q \u2212 R) + F ,\n\n(5)\n\nin which F satisfies (3) with Fis \u2192 F = (F1s , F2s ) and Hij \u2192 H. The coupled\nequations of motion (5) have been solved by Zimmermann and co-workers [2, 3]. Their\nsolutions were given in terms of the particle fluctuations around the potential minima\nR\u0303(t) = R(t) \u2212 Q as\nZ t\n\u2032\n\u2212tM\nR\u0303(t) = e\nR\u0303(0) +\ndt\u2032 e(t \u2212t)M F ,\n(6)\n0\n\nwhere M := kH \u2212 U. They form the basis of the analytic calculation of the correlation\nfunctions hR\u0303(0)R\u0303(t)i, where the brackets h. . .i denote an ensemble average.\n3. Simulation details\nIn order to simulate colloidal particles embedded in a sheared fluid environment, we\nused a combination of a simple molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and multiparticlecollision dynamics (MPCD), a mesoscopic solvent model to account for hydrodynamic\ninteractions [4].\n3.1. Multiparticle-collision dynamics\nThe MPCD method we employ has been developed to solve the equations of\nhydrodynamics in a fluctuating solvent. N point particles of the same mass m are used\nfor the transport of momentum through the system, while satisfying the conservation\nlaws of mass, energy and momentum locally. The algorithm consists of two steps, namely\nfree streaming interrupted by multiparticle collisions. In the streaming step, all fluid\n\n\fHS under shear flow\n\n4\n\nparticles are propagated ballistically with their velocities vk , i.e. the particle positions\nare updated according to a time increment h as\nxk (t + h) = xk (t) + hvk (t).\n\n(7)\n\nAfter the time step h, the N fluid particles are sorted into a lattice of cubic cells of size\na \u00d7 a \u00d7 a, so that on average n\u0304 particles are within each collision cell. Then, the particle\nvelocities are rotated around the center of mass velocity v\u0304 in this cell,\nvk (t + h) = v\u0304(t) + \u03a9(\u03b1) [vk (t) \u2212 v\u0304(t)] ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03a9(\u03b1) is a rotation matrix corresponding to a fixed angle \u03b1, which is generated\nrandomly for each cell. Before a collision step is carried out, the collision cell grid\nis shifted by a randomly chosen vector with components taken from the interval\n[\u2212a/2, a/2], to ensure Galilean invariance [5]. As the transport coefficients like the\ndynamic viscosity \u03b7 can be expressed as functions of the simulation parameters in an\nanalytical form [6, 7, 8], one can tune their values to fullfill the conditions of overdamping\nand low Re given in sec. 2.\nThe coupling between the colloidal particles and the fluid particles is accomplished in\nthe simplest manner, which means that a point particle with instantaneous velocity\nV and mass M takes part in the collision step eq. (8) within its cell with v\u0304 =\nP\n(MV + m n v) / (M + nm).\nIn order to shear the fluid in our system, we confined the simulation box of size L\u00d7L\u00d7L\nusing two flat walls in z direction at \u00b1L/2. Those were moved in x direction with\n(\u00b1)\nvelocities vw = \u00b1\u03b3\u0307L/2. To reduce fluid slip at the walls we used a bounce-back rule,\ni.e. if a fluid particle hits a wall during the streaming step, its velocity is inverted in the\n(\u00b1)\nrest frame of the wall (v \u2032 \u2192 \u2212v \u2032 ), where v \u2032 := v \u2212 vw . In combination, we used an\nalgorithm prosposed in [9]. Here, Npp pseudo-particles are inserted into the cells, which\nare cut by the flat walls as a consequence of the random shift, so that in the partially\nfilled cell the average number density is restored, n + Npp = n\u0304.\n3.2. Molecular dynamics\nIn the MD part of our simulations, the positions of the colloidal particles were computed\naccording to the Velocity Verlet algorithm with time step \u2206t several times between two\nconsecutive MPCD steps. The number of position updates is given as h/\u2206t. In the case\nof a pair of beads, we did not account for collisions between those. Hence we would\nexpect deviations from the behaviour derived in sec. 2 for small distances between the\npotential wells. As the \"colloidal\" beads also took part in the collision step as point\nparticles, there is no physical volume associated with them, and therefore no geometrical\nradius can be defined.\nFor our simulations we chose the following parameters: the temperature was set to\nkB T = 1 and was kept constant on average using the thermostat proposed in ref. [10].\nThe collision cell size a and the solvent particle mass m were set to unity as well. The\n\n\fHS under shear flow\n\n5\n\nsimulation box had dimensions 30 a \u00d7 30 a \u00d7 30 a. The mass of the colloids was set\nto M = 2m. The rotation angle had the value \u03b1 = 130\u25e6 . The two time steps of\nour hybrid\ndynamics simulations were \u2206t = 0.0001\u03c4 and h = 0.01\u03c4 , both in units of\np\n\u03c4 := ma2 /kB T . The collision cells were occupied on average by n\u0304 = 10 point particles.\n\u221a\nWith those parameters, the dynamic viscosity was calculated as \u03b7 \u2248 82.2 kB T m/a2 .\nThe value for the strength of the potential wells was k = 10 kB T /a2 and the rate with\nwhich the fluid is sheared was set to \u03b3\u0307 = 0.04 \u03c4 \u22121 . With those values, a Reynolds number of O(Re) \u2248 0.1 \u226a 2300 results. Furthermore, the ratio \u03b6/m, which is a measure for\nthe damping in the system, is of the order of O (\u03b6/m) \u2248 102 \u226b 1. Hence, the trapped\nparticles perform an overdamped motion embedded in a laminar fluid flow.\n4. Results\nIn the following we will present our results for both the auto-correlations (AC) and the\ncross-correlations (CC) in the random displacements of Brownian particles embedded\nin a liquid. The simulations were done in a quiescent as well as in a sheared fluid. We\nfocus on fluctuations parallel (x) and perpendicular (z) to the direction of the shear\nflow. The correlation data was measured as the average of 105 \u2212 106 time series. Error\nbars are given by the standard deviation of the data sets.\n4.1. Single sphere\nGiven the defining properties of the stochastic forces (eq. (3)), the Langevin equation\neq. (1) for a single particle embedded in a fluid without flow leads to an isotropic AC\nfunction, which decays exponentially with a relaxation time \u03c4p = \u03b6/k\nkB T \u2212t/\u03c4p\ne\n.\n(9)\nk\nUsing this equation, we determined the relaxation time from our simulation data as\n\u03c4p = 23.7 \u03c4 . As the fluctuations of orthogonal fluid velocity components do not couple\nfor \u03b3\u0307 = 0, the CCs vanish, hx\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i = hx\u0303(t)z\u0303(0)i = 0.\nThe situation changes if the colloidal bead is exposed to a sheared fluid. Then the AC\nin the shear direction is modified to\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nWi2\nt\nkB T\n1+\n1+\ne\u2212t/\u03c4p ,\n(10)\nhx\u0303(0)x\u0303(t)i =\nk\n2\n\u03c4p\nhx\u0303(0)x\u0303(t)i = hz\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i =\n\nwhile hz\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i equals the one of eq. (9). Here, eq. (10) is given in terms of the Weissenberg number Wi := \u03b3\u0307\u03c4p = 0.95. Both correlation functions are shown in figure 1.\n\nNow, if there is a finite shear rate, the CCs are not zero anymore and fluctuations\nof orthogonal components couple under the influence of the linear velocity profile of the\nsurrounding fluid. This can be visualized by the distribution of the particle positions\nin the shear plane, as it is depicted in figure 2. Here the distribution, which would be\nspherical in the case of a quiescent fluid, assumes an elliptical shape.

There, the initial increase of hx\u0303(t)z\u0303(0)i reflects the\nfact, that finite fluctuations z\u0303(0) 6= 0 are carried away by the shear flow in x-direction\nbefore the initial displacement starts to relax. The analytical predictions are in excellent\nagreement with the simulation data (no fit parameters).\n4.2. Two hard spheres\nIn the case of two trapped particles, not only correlations between fluctuations in\ndifferent directions of each colloid are of interest, but also inter-particle correlations\nlike hx\u03031 (t)x\u03032 (0)i. Those are functions of the distance between the potential minima\nD = |q12 |, where q12 := q1 \u2212 q2 is the connection vector of the two potential wells.

Cross-correlations of particle position for a single particle in shear flow.\nThe arrow denotes the size of the error bars.\n\norder to compare our results with analytical expressions, one has to be in a regime where\nthe hydrodynamic radii \u033a of the particles are small compared to D. To obtain a value\nfor \u033a, we used the definitions of the relaxation time \u03c4p = \u03b6/k and the friction coefficient,\nfrom which it follows that \u033a = \u03c4p k/6\u03c0\u03b7. In our simulations the hydrodynamic radius\nroughly equals 0.15 a.\nIn this section we will follow the nomenclature of ref. [2] and introduce the four relaxation\nrates:\n1 \u2212 2\u03bc\n1 + 2\u03bc\n,\n\u03bb3 =\n,\n\u03bb1 =\n\u03c4p\n\u03c4p\n(13)\n1+\u03bc\n1\u2212\u03bc\n\u03bb2 =\n,\n\u03bb4 =\n,\n\u03c4p\n\u03c4p\n\n\f8\n\nHS under shear flow\n\nwith the parameter \u03bc := 3\u033a/4D. To illustrate the meaning of the \u03bbi , let us consider a\nsituation in which the two particles, after experiencing independent stochastic kicks, are\npulled back into the minima of their potential wells, respectively. This relaxation process\ncan be decomposed into two modes for each spacial direction, namely a parallel and an\nanti-parallel translation of the particles. As the hydrodynamic interaction between the\nspheres depends on their relative motion, restoring is accelerated in the parallel and\ndamped in the anti-parallel case. Here, the modes for the two directions perpendicular\nto q12 coincide, so that only the above relaxation rates are left over.\nA previous experimental study [11] with two trapped Brownian particles in a quiescent\nfluid showed anti-correlations between random fluctuations along same directions. These\nanti-correlations are a function of \u03bc. In addition, the functions are modified under the\ninfluence of a linear shear profile in a similar manner as the AC function for fluctuations\nin shear direction in the one-particle case (10). Including this shear flow correction,\nwhich is proportional to Wi2 , hx\u03031 (0)x\u03032 (t)i is given by\n\u0001\n1\nhx\u03031 (0)x\u03032 (t)i = e\u2212\u03bb1 t \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb3 t\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne\u2212\u03bb2 t\nWi2 \u2212 (1 + \u03bc) e\u2212\u03bb1 t\n+\n+\n(14)\n4\u03bc\n6\u03bc2 + 7\u03bc + 2\n2 + 3\u03bc\n\u0012\n\u0013\nWi2 \u2212 (1 + \u03bc) e\u2212\u03bb3 t\ne\u2212\u03bb4 t\n+\n+\n4\u03bc\n6\u03bc2 \u2212 7\u03bc + 2\n2 \u2212 3\u03bc\nThe simulation data for the CC functions and eq. (14) are plotted in figure 4 for an\nunsheared system (Wi = 0) with two different D and a sheared (non-zero Wi) system.\nAgain, the agreement with the analytical predictions is very good. We note that not only\nthe depths of the minima differ but also the position of the strongest anti-correlation\nchanges when the particles are embedded in a sheared environment.\nIn the data for Wi = 0 and D = 0.5a (black circles in figure 4) there is an additional\ndecrease of the CC function at long times, which is not covered by the error bars.\nA similar behaviour can be found in the data of ref. [11] for small distances between\nthe laser potentials. The origin and the physical relevance of this effect need further\ninvestigation.\nFinally, we will briefly discuss inter-particle correlations between perpendicular\nfluctuation directions, namely hx\u03031 (0)z\u03032 (t)i and hz\u03031 (0)x\u03032 (t)i. The behaviour of the latter\ncan be understood as a combination of the inter-particle anti-correlation of fluctuations\nin shear direction and the fact, that a fluctuation in z-direction of a single particle is\nfollowed by a positive motion in x-direction (cf. equation (12))\nantiCC\n\nx\u03032 \u2212\u2192 x\u03031 = x\u03031 (z\u03031 )\n\nshear flow\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nz\u03031 ,\n\n\f9\n\nHS under shear flow\n\ncross-correlations\n\n0\n-0.05\n-0.1\n-0.15\n-0.2\n-0.25\n0\n\n1\n\nWi = 0, D = 0.5a\nWi = 0.95, D = 0.5a\nWi = 0, D = 1.5a\n2\n3\n4\ntime [\u03c4p]\n\nFigure 4.\nCross-correlations of fluctuations parallel to the shear direction,\nhx\u03031 (0)x\u03032 (t)i, between two beads for unsheared (simulation: black circles, blue\ndiamonds, theory: green and orange line) and sheared system (simulation: red squares,\ntheory: blue line).\n\ncross-correlations\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n~ (t) >, D = 0.5a\n<~\nx1(0)z\n2\n~ (t) >, D = 0.5a\n<~\nz1(0)x\n2\n~ (t) >, D = 1.5a\n<~\nz1(0)x\n2\n\n-0.3\n0\n\n1\n\n2\ntime [\u03c4p]\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 5.

The\ngreen stars in fig. 6 are the experimental values for the single particle cross correlation\nfunctions hx\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i (left panel) and hz\u0303(0)x\u0303(t)i (right panel). There are clear differences\nwith respect to the simulation results in fig. 3. hx\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i shows a pronounced minimum,\nwhile the simulated curve drops monotonically (red squares in fig. 3), and the decay of\nthe experimental hz\u0303(0)x\u0303(t)i is much faster than of the simulation data (black circles in\nfig. 3).\nIn contrast to our simulation (in which there was only one particle), in the experiment the single-particle CCs were obtained using a system that contained two particles.\nHence, the single-particle correlations of perpendicular fluctuations are influenced by\npresence of the second particle. For small potential well distances this can lead to deviations from the analytical description given in [2], which is only valid for small \u03bc, i.e.\nlarge distances D. In the PhD thesis of A. Ziehl [12] it is suggested that these deviations\nare possibly the origin of the additional minimum in hx\u0303(0)z\u0303(t)i. To test this hypothesis,\nwe also analysed the CCs for reasonably large \u03bc with a second particle present. The\nsimulation data is plotted in figure 6. Here, the functions were renormalized to account\nfor the different Weissenberg number of Wiexp \u2248 0.62. Our data shows the development\nof a minimum with increasing \u03bc which supports the hypothesis. However, the minimum\nis much less pronounced than the one in the experimental data. Hence there might be\nother sources for this effect.\nFig. 7 shows the experimental data for the two particle correlation functions. There\nis a clear difference in time-scales between simulation and experiment (left panel). This\nis suspected to be due to deviations in the prodcution process of the microfluidic device,\nwhich cause changes in the trapping potential [13]. To compare our results of the\ninter-particle CC functions, we renormalized the time scale to match the experimental\nrelaxation time \u03c4exp , which is given by the position of the minimum of hz\u03031 (0)x\u03032 (t)i and\nwhich differs from the relaxation time used before in ref. [3]. We again took into account\nthe different Wi. After these transformations have been applied, the data sets show very\ngood agreement (right panel).\n5. Summary\nWe have presented a computer simulation study of the hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween two colloids in a sheared fluid. In particular, we have tested the hypothesis\nthat the recently observed non-monotonic behaviour in the cross-correlation function of\nthe position of a single particle is due to the presence of a second particle. We found\nthat a second particle produces this effect, but it might not be the full explanation.\nAnother source could be the rotational motion of the colloids, which we neglected in\nthe simulation.\n\n\f11\n\nHS under shear flow\n\ncross-correlations\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bc = 0.0038\n\u03bc = 0.228\n\u03bc = 0.281, exp.
