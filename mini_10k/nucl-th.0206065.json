INTRODUCTION\n\nThe solution of the nuclear many-body problem presents a formidable challenge. Not\nonly bare and effective nucleon-nucleon forces are not completely known, but still for those\ngiven as granted one has to solve the many-body problem of a highly quantal, strongly interacting, self-bound, and therefore inhomogeneous Fermi system. Over the years semiclassical\ntechniques have helped to solve this problem, for instance in regard to the latter aspect. In\npractice it is mainly the Thomas-Fermi (TF) method and its extensions for the description\nof nuclear ground-state properties which has been considered (see [1] and references therein).\nThe nuclear density and kinetic energy density are the main ingredients of this approach.\nThe semiclassical approximation often gives a direct physical insight, yielding the shell\naverage of the quantities under consideration and providing their main trend (which, in\ncertain cases, may be obscured by strong shell fluctuations). A known example is e.g.\nthe nuclear binding energy which coincides with the liquid drop part in the semiclassical\napproach. Another quantity of longstanding interest is the average single-particle level\ndensity. It is well known that the TF approximation to the level density (including h\u0304\ncorrections) coincides analytically with the Strutinsky averaged quantal level density for\nthe harmonic oscillator (HO) potential [2]. First performing the quantal calculation and\nthen the average is more cumbersome than calculating the shell average directly via the\nTF method. The technical advantage of the latter becomes significant in the deformed case\n[2] or, for instance, when one wants to go beyond the independent particle description to\ninclude correlations [3]. The TF approach is also very helpful for the calculation of surface\nand curvature energies. Actually, the latter quantity can only be correctly extracted in a\nsemiclassical procedure [4].\nIn general, however, we believe that the true virtue of the TF method shows up not\nonly in calculating average properties in the independent particle approximation, where\nit can replace the results obtained through the more cumbersome Strutinsky method [5],\nbut rather in many-body applications going beyond the mean field or independent particle\npicture where a straightforward quantum solution for finite systems may reach its limits. A\ncase where we treated correlation effects in TF approximation was, as already mentioned, the\nlevel density parameter [3]. Pairing correlations in finite nuclei have also already successfully\nbeen treated in the past [6]. This is one of the aspects which we shall consider again in this\nwork in more detail.\nIn this work we want to dwell on an aspect of Thomas-Fermi theory which in the past has\nbeen exploited only very little. This concerns the evaluation of matrix elements averaged\nover a certain energy interval which may be typically of the order of h\u0304\u03c9, i.e., the separation\nof major shells. It must be pointed out that this is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to\nevaluate not only one-body but also two-body matrix elements in the TF approximation.\nThis semiclassical calculation provides the smoothly varying part of the matrix elements\ndropping the shell effects according to the idea of the Strutinsky averaging method [7]. We\nwill describe several tests of the accuracy of the TF method for on-shell densities. In a first\npart we will develop our approach for the matrix elements of single-particle operators, for\ngiven parity and angular momentum. This goes along similar lines already developed in the\ndomain of systems with chaotic behaviour [8\u201311]. In a second part we will address our main\nobjective, which is to show that the method also works for two-body matrix elements. Some\n2\n\n\fpreliminary results have been published previously in Ref. [12]. As a specific example we\nwill treat the pairing matrix elements.\nLet us give a short summary of the approach we are going to develop. Consider for\nexample the expectation value of a single particle operator \u00d4 in some shell model state |\u03bdi:\nO\u03bd = h\u03bd|\u00d4|\u03bdi = T r[\u00d4|\u03bdih\u03bd|].\n\n(1)\n\nInstead of knowing O\u03bd quantum state by quantum state it may some times be advantageous\nand instructive to only know how the matrix element (1) changes as a function of energy.\nWe therefore introduce a single-particle matrix element averaged over the energy shell:\nO(E) = T r[\u00d4\u03c1\u0302E ],\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we call \u03c1\u0302E the density matrix on the energy shell. It is related with the so-called\nspectral density matrix and will be defined immediately below.\nThe spectral density matrix \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124) has the characteristic discontinuous behaviour\ndue to the quantization of the eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian \u0124. It can\nbe written, however, as a sum of a smooth part \u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124) and of a strongly oscillating\npart, i.e., \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124) = \u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124) + \u03b4osc (E \u2212 \u0124) [1,13,14]. Analogously, the single-particle\nP\nlevel density g(E) = T r[\u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124)] = \u03bd \u03b4(E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd ) is obtained as a sum of two terms:\ng(E) = g\u0303(E) + gosc (E), where g\u0303 and gosc stand for the smooth and the rapidly fluctuating\ncontributions, respectively. Using the smooth \u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124) and g\u0303(E), we define the density\nmatrix averaged on the energy shell as\n\u03c1\u0302E =\n\n1\n1 X\n\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124) =\n\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd )|\u03bdih\u03bd|.\ng\u0303(E)\ng\u0303(E) \u03bd\n\n(3)\n\nIt is therefore a smooth function of E. The smeared level density g\u0303(E) (per spin and isospin\nin this paper) in the denominator of expression (3) ensures the right normalization of \u03c1\u0302E ,\nsince g\u0303(E) = T r[\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124)].\nThe smooth quantities entering eq.(3) are to be evaluated in some continuum limit [13,14]:\nthis is the case for example when one introduces the Strutinsky averaging procedure [5,7]\nor, alternatively, and this is the approach we adopt in this work, it can be done by replacing\n\u0124, the independent-particle (mean field) Hamiltonian, by its classical counterpart Hcl which\ncorresponds to the TF approximation [1]. Such an approximation has been used very early\nby Migdal [15] and later, as already mentioned, in the context of chaotic motion dynamics\n[8\u201311]. Recently, we have employed it to describe Bose condensates in traps [16], but we\nare not aware of any systematic use in the context of nuclear physics. The approach is not\nlimited to the evaluation of expectation values of single particle operators. Also the average\nbehavior of two-body matrix elements can be calculated. For instance the semiclassical\nevaluation of the average pairing matrix element\nv(E, E \u2032 ) =\n\nX\n1\n\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd ) \u03b4\u0303(E \u2032 \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd \u2032 ) h\u03a6(\u03bd, \u03bd\u0304)|v|\u03a6(\u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 )i,\ng\u0303(E)g\u0303(E \u2032 ) \u03bd,\u03bd \u2032\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |\u03a6(\u03bd, \u03bd\u0304)i is an antisymmetric normalized two-body state constructed out of a state |\u03bdi\nand its time-reversed state |\u03bd\u0304i, can be of great practical interest and shall be considered in\n3\n\n\fthis work. As it is known [1,2], the Strutinsky method averages the density matrix over an\nenergy interval corresponding roughly to the distance between two major shells. Implicitly\nthe same holds if the equivalent Wigner-Kirkwood expansion (TF approximation at lowest\norder) is used for \u03c1\u0302E .\nIn detail our paper is organized as follows. In the next section the Wigner function on\nthe energy shell is introduced and applied to the evaluation of some semiclassical one-body\nand two-body matrix elements of physical interest. Our conclusions are given in the last\nsection.\nII. WIGNER FUNCTION ON THE ENERGY SHELL\n\nAs stated in eq. (3) of the introduction, we are interested in the density matrix \u03c1\u0302E on\nthe energy shell. Consider the Wigner transform [1] of the density matrix (3), namely\nfE (R, p) =\n\nZ\n\ndse\u2212ips/h\u0304 hR + s/2|\u03c1\u0302E |R \u2212 s/2i,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nR = (r + r \u2032 )/2,\n\ns = r \u2212 r\u2032\n\nare the centroid and relative coordinates respectively. In order to obtain the TF approximation plus h\u0304 corrections to the Wigner function on the energy shell (5), it is convenient\nto differentiate with respect to E the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion of the full single-particle\none-body density matrix \u03c1\u0302 = \u0398(E \u2212 \u0124), which is amply given in the literature [1]. Up to\norder h\u03042 the result is\nfE (R, p) =\n\n1\nh\u03042 2 \u2032\u2032\n\u03b4(E \u2212 Hcl ) \u2212\n\u2207 V \u03b4 (E \u2212 Hcl )\ng\u0303(E)\n8M\n\u0015\n1\nh\u03042\n4\n2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n[(\u2207V ) + (p * \u2207) V ]\u03b4 (E \u2212 Hcl ) + O(h\u0304 ) .\n+\n24M\nM\n\u0014\n\n(6)\n\nOne should realize that g\u0303(E) also contains h\u0304 corrections and that, strictly speaking, in order\nto get a consistent expansion of fE one should also take into account the h\u0304 expansion of\ng\u0303(E) and then correctly sort out relation (6) to order h\u03042 (see also comments at the end of\nSection II.A).\nThe first term in eq. (6) represents evidently the pure TF approximation which is of\nlowest order in h\u0304. In a first attempt and to assess the accuracy of our approximation we\nwill content ourselves with the TF approximation. Integration over the momenta yields the\nlocal density on the energy shell:\n\u03c1TEF (R)\n\n1 Z\nMkE (R)\n=\n,\ndpfET F (R, p) = 2 2\n3\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)\n2\u03c0 h\u0304 g\u0303(E)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\nkE (R) =\n\ns\n\n2M\n(E \u2212 V (R))\nh\u03042\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fis the local momentum at the energy E in the potential V (R) and the level density g\u0303(E) is\ngiven by\ng\u0303(E) =\n\nZ\n\ndR\n\nMkE (R)\n.\n2\u03c0 2h\u03042\n\n(9)\n\nFor the following it is important to first elaborate on the meaning and accuracy of this density\non the energy shell. For demonstration purposes we will take as an example the spherical\nHO potential but later we will see that our method works equally well for a Woods-Saxon\n(WS) potential.\nIn fig. 1 we display the quantal (solid line) and TF (dash-dotted line) densities of the\nN = 4 and N = 5 HO shells with h\u0304\u03c9 = 41A\u22121/3 and A = 224. For the TF densities we\nhave taken the quantal energies. We see that in both cases the TF result passes accurately\nthrough the average, terminating at the classical turning point defined by\nE = V (Rcl ).\n\n(10)\n\nThe features of the TF densities on the energy shell are quite analogous to the ones already\nknown for the full TF density [1]. However, on the quantal side one remarks that there is a\nstrong difference between odd parity (N = 5) and even parity (N = 4) shells. The former\nshows a pronounced hole at the origin whereas the second ones shows, on the contrary, an\nenhancement. Both features can obviously be related to the absence or presence of the swave contributions in the corresponding HO shell, respectively. One may try to recover this\neven-odd parity effect in projecting the TF density matrix on good parity. This is easily\ndone as follows. We calculate the inverse Wigner transform of fET F (R, p). This yields\n\u03c1TEF (r, r \u2032 ) = \u03c1TEF (R)j0 [skE (R)],\n\n(11)\n\nwhere j0 is the zeroth-order spherical Bessel function. Now the even/odd parity density on\nthe energy shell is obtained as\ne/o\n\u03c1E (r)\n\n1\n1\n= \u03c1TEF (r, r\u2032 ) \u00b1 \u03c1TEF (r, \u2212r \u2032 )\n= \u03c1TEF (r) \u00b1 \u03c1TEF (0)j0 [2rkE (0)] .\n2\nr =r \u2032 2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(12)\n\nWe have drawn this expression in fig. 1 (dashed lines) as well. The bump (hole) structure\nexhibited by the quantal density is now well reproduced in the interior. The agreement\nonly deteriorates near the classical turning point. One should mention, however, that in\nspite of the seemingly rather spectacular improvement of formula (12) over (7), the former\npresents some small problems. This concerns the behavior of (12) around the turning point.\nThe presence of the second term in (12) can induce a slightly negative value of the density\naround the turning point. Also the second term is not naturally limited to r values inside the\nturning point and thus is oscillating around zero due to the Bessel function. This leads to\nambiguities in evaluating matrix elements such as (2) which, however, numerically are rather\nunimportant. Thus we advocate to use (7) instead of (12), excepting for some problems\nwhere the even/odd bump structure may be particularly important. The latter may for\nexample be the case for the evaluation of matrix elements of operators more concentrated\nat the nuclear interior like e.g. 1/r 2, etc.\n5\n\n\fA. One-body matrix elements\n\nWe now proceed to calculate in TF approximation as a function of the energy the rms\nradius of a nucleon confined in a WS potential with V0 = \u221244 MeV, a= 0.67 fm and R =\n1.27A1/3 fm with A=224 nucleons. We choose the rms radius for demonstration purposes\nbut we could have taken as well any other smoothly varying single-particle operator. We use\nthe TF approximation (11) and show the results (dashed line) together with their quantum\nmechanical counterparts, represented by dots, in fig. 2. We see that the TF calculation very\nnicely passes through the average of the scattered quantal values, with the exception of the\nlowest s-state. This is a first confirmation of the accuracy of our approach.\nIn a next step we want to project the TF density matrix on different partial waves and\ncalculate matrix elements as a function of the energy for different l-values. One way to\nproject on partial waves has been elaborated by Hasse [17]. There one pre-multiplies the\nWigner function with the semiclassical projectors on the orbital angular momentum and its\nz-component, i.e.,\nfE,l,m(R, p) =\n\n1\ng\u0303E,l,m\n\n\u03b4(l \u2212 |R \u00d7 p|)\u03b4(m \u2212 lz (R, p))\u03b4(E \u2212 Hcl ).\n\n(13)\n\nThen one can calculate single particle matrix elements as\nO(E, l, m) =\n\nZ\n\ndRdp\nO(R, p)fE,l,m(R, p)\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n\n(14)\n\nFor local operators it is sufficient to know the density, which can be obtained in integrating\n(13) over momenta. Assuming spherical symmetry we can also sum over the m quantum\nnumbers and after some algebra one finally finds [17]:\n2l + 1\n\u03c1E,l (R) = 2 2\n8\u03c0 R g\u0303E,l\n\ns\n\n(l + 21 )2 h\u03042\n2M\nE\n\u2212\nV\n(R)\n\u2212\n2MR2\nh\u03042\n\"\n\n#\u22121/2\n\n(l + 21 )2h\u03042\n.\n\u0398 E \u2212 V (R) \u2212\n2MR2\n!\n\n(15)\nwhere the level density g\u0303E,l is chosen in such a way that the integral of (15) over the available\nR space is normalized to unity. Let us mention that we have replaced l(l + 1) by (l + 21 )2\nas it is done in the WKB method to recover the right asymptotic behaviour of the wave\nfunction in the free (V (R) = 0) case [18].\nWe recently employed, however, a different way to do the l-projection which for some purposes may be more convenient [19]. For this we first perform the inverse Wigner-transform\nof the TF part of eq. (6):\n1\n\u03c1E (r, r ) =\ng\u0303(E)\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\np2\ndp ip*r/h\u0304 \u2212ip*r\u2032 /h\u0304\ne\ne\n\u03b4(E\n\u2212\n\u2212 V (R)).\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n2M\n\n(16)\n\nExpanding the plane waves in spherical harmonics,\neik*r = 4\u03c0\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n(\u2212i)l jl (kr)Ylm (\u03a9k )Ylm\n(\u03a9r ),\n\nl,m\n\n6\n\n(17)\n\n\fwe can read off the l-projected density matrix. For the local density we then obtain\n2\n2M\n\u03c1E,l,m (R) =\nk\n(R)\nj\n(Rk\n(R))\n|Ylm (\u03a9)|2 \u0398(E \u2212 V (R)),\nE\nl\nE\ng\u0303E,l,m \u03c0h\u03042\n\n1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(18)\n\nwhere g\u0303E,l,m is again chosen to ensure the right normalization of (18), i.e., dR\u03c1E,l,m(R) = 1.\nWe can calculate for example the mean square radius as a function of E for different l values:\nR\n\nhR2 iE,l =\n\nZ\n\ndRR2 \u03c1E,l,m (R).\n\n(19)\n\nNotice that eq.(19) becomes independent of m after the angular integration.\nIn table I we show various moments hRn i1/n (in fm) obtained using the TF local densities\non the energy shell provided by eqs.(15) and (18), as compared with the corresponding\nquantal values for the aforementioned WS potential with A = 224 nucleons. From these\ntables one can see that the quantal rms radius (n = 2) of each nl state is, on average, well\nreproduced using the semiclassical l-projected on-shell densities given by the TF approaches\neqs.(15) and (18), where E has been replaced by the quantal eigenvalue corresponding to the\nnl state (for consistency we should perform a WKB quantization from which we refrain for\nsimplicity as it should not affect the result by much). A more quantitative analysis shows\nthat the quantal rms radii are reproduced by eq.(15) within 2% in average over the range\nof energies considered, while using eq.(18) the average relative error is around 4%. Higher\nmoments obtained with the TF densities on the energy shell also reproduce reasonably well\nthe results of the full quantal calculation. For the highest moment considered here (n = 10),\nthe average relative error with respect to the quantal calculation is around 4.3% for both\nsemiclassical approximations. One should point out that the TF local densities on the energy\nshell are free of the shell effects that are present in the quantal calculation. Actually, the\nTF results represent the shell averaged values of the moments and their difference with the\nquantal calculations provides an estimate of the shell correction for the considered state.\nOf course, a precise calculation of the shell correction in the considered moments would\nrequire a Strutinsky calculation which is not an easy task for a WS potential. For a related\ndiscussion we refer the reader to [20], where the moments ranging from n = 1 to n = 10\nof the total density of A = 224 particles in a HO potential were evaluated using several\nsemiclassical approaches and the Strutinsky averaging method. The fact that TF works for\nmoments as high as n = 10 makes us believe that one can certainly consider in our approach\nall single-particle operators which are low-order polynomials in the phase-space variables.\nIt is also instructive to directly compare the densities. For this we again take E equal\nto its quantal value in eqs.(15) and (18). The comparison between the quantal and TF\non-shell densities is shown in figs. 3-5. In each one of these figures the quantal on-shell\ndensity (solid line) and the semiclassical densities provided by eq.(15) (dash-dotted line)\nand eq.(18) (dashed line) are displayed for all the bound s and p states of a WS potential\nwith A = 224. From these figures one can see that the quantal on-shell densities are rather\nwell reproduced by the TF approach eq.(18). In particular the quantal 1l on-shell densities\nare well reproduced by eq.(18) in the interior. However, as it happens in fig. 1, there are\ndiscrepancies between the quantal and TF densities in the outer part around the classical\nturning point. For nl states (n > 1), the inner n \u2212 1 bumps are well reproduced by eq.(18)\nand the agreement deteriorates in the outer bumps due to the classical turning point where\n7\n\n\fthe TF densities vanish. On the other hand the TF on-shell densities obtained with eq.(15)\ndo not reproduce the quantal density profiles at all. As it can be seen from eq.(15), this\ndensity is defined in the region in between the two roots (turning points) of\nE \u2212 V (R) \u2212\n\n(l + 21 )2 h\u03042\n= 0.\n2MR2\n\n(20)\n\nIn this approach the three-dimensional problem has been reduced to an equivalent onedimensional problem for R with an effective potential that in addition to V (R) contains\nthe centrifugal barrier, as it happens in the WKB method. Thus, in this case we find two\ndifferent turning points. The largest root of (20) is very close to the classical turning point of\neq.(18) given by kE = 0 [see eq.(8)], while the smallest root gives the inner turning point due\nto the centrifugal barrier. Since the TF on-shell density (15) has square root singularities at\nthe two turning points, its integral as well as the corresponding expectation values converge.\nWe arrive at the, at first sight, paradoxical result that the densities (15) which have no\ndetailed resemblance with the quantal ones reproduce the rms values (and very likely most\nof other expectation values of smoothly varying operators) better than the densities given in\n(18), which show quite reasonable overall behaviour in comparison with the quantal results.\nWe here find an illustrating example that the Thomas-Fermi and Wigner-Kirkwood local\ndensities are to be regarded as mathematical distributions, in the sense that in spite of their\npossible divergences they yield finite, accurate results when used to compute a restricted\nclass of expectation values by integration [13,20]. In this respect we again refer the reader\nto tables I and II where he finds confirmation of our statement. A similar situation is found\nin computing the kinetic energy for a bosonic system in Ref. [16]: the semiclassical and\nquantal kinetic energy densities are clearly different but give similar values of the integrated\nkinetic energy. On the other hand, one should note that sorting out correctly the various\norders in h\u0304 is very important to achieve optimal results as shown on other occasions [20,21].\nIn expression (18) there remain some h\u0304 corrections to all orders in the form of the spherical\nharmonics which are quantal wave functions, i.e., solutions of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This\nmixing of resummation in h\u0304 on the one hand and of lowest order in h\u0304 on the other hand\n[in the form of the \u03b4-function in (16)] finally makes the on-shell density (18) slightly less\naccurate than (15), which represents the correct h\u0304 \u2192 0 limit as shown in Ref. [17].\nB. Two-body matrix elements\n\nAs a further interesting application we want to consider the semiclassical evaluation of\naverage two-body matrix elements. An example of particular interest is e.g. the case of\nmatrix elements of the pairing type h\u03a6(\u03bd, \u03bd\u0304)|v|\u03a6(\u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 )i [see eq. (4)], which we shall address\nin this section for identical nucleons. It is straightforward to recast the state-dependent\npairing matrix element as\nh\u03a6(\u03bd, \u03bd\u0304)|v|\u03a6(\u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 )i = h\u03bd \u03bd\u0304|v|\u03bd \u2032 \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 i \u2212 h\u03bd \u03bd\u0304|v|\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 \u03bd \u2032 i.\n\n(21)\n\nThe two-particle states |\u03bd \u03bd\u0304i on the r.h.s. are product states of |\u03bdi and |\u03bd\u0304i. The states |\u03bdi\nare represented by single-particle wave functions \u03c6\u03bd (r, \u03c3) = \u03c6nlm (r) \u03c7\u03c3 (with \u03c3 = \u00b1 21 ).\nAssuming spherical symmetry, and considering that the time reversal of |\u03bdi involves\n\u2217\nT\u0302 (Ylm \u03c7\u03c3 ) = (\u22121)m Yl,\u2212m (\u22121)1/2\u2212\u03c3 \u03c7\u2212\u03c3 = (\u22121)1/2\u2212\u03c3 Ylm\n\u03c7\u2212\u03c3 , one finds\n8\n\n\fX\n1 X X\nh\u03a6(\u03bd, \u03bd\u0304)|v|\u03a6(\u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 )i =\n4 m,m\u2032 \u03c3,\u03c3\u2032\nm,m\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndrdr \u2032 \u03c6nlm (r \u2032 )\u03c6\u2217nlm(r) v(r \u2212 r \u2032 ) \u03c6n\u2032 l\u2032 m\u2032 (r)\u03c6\u2217n\u2032l\u2032 m\u2032 (r\u2032 ).\n(22)\n\nAccording to this result, we obtain the following expression for the average pairing matrix\nelements of eq.(4):\n\u2032\n\nv(E, E ) =\n\nZ\n\ndrdr\u2032 \u03c1E (r, r \u2032 )v(r \u2212 r \u2032 )\u03c1E \u2032 (r\u2032 , r),\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c1E (r, r \u2032 ) = hr|\u03c1\u0302E |r\u2032 i. In TF approximation the non-local on-shell density matrix\n\u03c1E (r, r\u2032 ) is given by eq.(11). We see that it is a symmetric function in r and r \u2032 .\nFor the case of a force v0 \u03b4(r \u2212 r \u2032 ) eq.(23) reduces to (a practically identical expression\ncan be found in Ref. [22])\n\u2032\n\nv(E, E ) = v0\n\nZ\n\ndr\u03c1E (r)\u03c1E \u2032 (r).\n\n(24)\n\nUsing the TF expression (7) for \u03c1E (r) we can evaluate (24) with a HO potential V (r) =\nm\u03c902 r 2 /2 and compare with the quantum mechanical matrix elements averaged on each\nmajor shell N of energy E = EN = (N + 23 )h\u0304\u03c9. This is done in Table II with v0 = \u2212345.723\nMeV fm3 and h\u0304\u03c90 = 41A\u22121/3 MeV. We again see that the semiclassical results agree very\nwell with the averaged quantal values, even for the non-diagonal elements.\nWith the above positive experience at hand, next we proceed to calculate the average\npairing matrix elements v(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ) of the Gogny D1S force [23] which is known to reproduce\nexperimental gap values when used in microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations\n[24]. Writing the diagonal matrix element (4) at the Fermi energy \u03b5F , by using (23), and\nexpressing it through the lowest-order Wigner function in inverting (5), one arrives in TF\napproximation at\nv(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ) =\n\n1\ng\u0303(\u03b5F )2\n\nZ\n\ndR\n\nZ\n\ndpdp\u2032\n\u03b4(\u03b5F \u2212 Hcl (R, p))v(p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u03b4(\u03b5F \u2212 Hcl (R, p\u2032 )).\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)6\n\n(25)\n\nHere, Hcl = p2 /2M \u2217 + V (R) is the classical Hamiltonian of independent particles with\neffective mass M \u2217 (see below) moving in an external potential well V (R), and v(p \u2212 p\u2032 ) is\nthe Fourier transform of the particle-particle part of the Gogny force which describes the\npairing. For the numerical application we use for V (R) a slight variant of the potential\ngiven by Shlomo [14]:\nV (R) = \u2212\n\nV0\nV0\n+\n1 + exp (\u2212R0 /d) 1 + exp ((R \u2212 R0 )/d)\n\n(26)\n\nwith\nR0 =\n\n1.12A1/3 + 1\nfm,\n[1 + (\u03c0d/R0 )2 ]1/3\n\nd = 0.70 fm,\n\nIn this equation R0 has to be determined iteratively.\n9\n\nand\n\nV0 = \u221254 MeV.\n\n(27)\n\n\fEquation (25) can be reduced to a one dimensional integral over R which can be performed numerically:\nv(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ) =\n\n2\nX\n\nzc\n\nc=1\n\n1\n\u03bc2c\n\nZ\n\nRc\n\n0\n\ndRR2 B exp [\u2212a(\u03b5F \u2212 V (R))] sinh [a(\u03b5F \u2212 V (R))],\n\n(28)\n\nwhere Rc is the classical turning point defined in (10) and\n1\nB= 3\n4\u03c0 g\u0303(\u03b5F )2\n\n\u0012\n\n2M \u2217\nh\u03042\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\na=\n\nM \u2217 \u03bc2c\n,\nh\u03042\n\nand\n\nzc = \u03c0 3/2 \u03bc3c (Wc \u2212 Bc \u2212 Hc + Mc ).\n(29)\n\nThe factors zc correspond to pairing in the S = 0 and T = 1 channel and are written in\nterms of the parameters of the Gogny force Wc , Bc , Hc , Mc and \u03bcc [23]. We have introduced\nthe position-dependent effective mass M \u2217 (R) from the Gogny force in order to make the\ncalculation of the pairing matrix element more realistic. It is obtained by evaluating at\nk = k\u03b5F (R) the position- and momentum-dependent effective mass [25]\nM \u2202\nM\n=\n1\n+\nU(R, k),\nM \u2217 (R, k)\nh\u03042 k \u2202k\n\n(30)\n\nwhere U(R, k) is the Wigner transform of the single-particle potential obtained from the\nGogny interaction assumed spherically symmetric in k.\nAlso the level density g\u0303(\u03b5F ) is calculated in the TF approach using the same potential\nand effective mass:\n1\ng\u0303(\u03b5F ) =\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nRc\n\ndRR\n\n2\n\n2M \u2217 (R)\nh\u03042\n\n!3/2 q\n\n\u03b5F \u2212 V (R).\n\n(31)\n\nIn fig. 6 we show Av(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ) as a function of the mass number A. The Coulomb force\nhas been switched off in the present calculation. We see that there is a quite pronounced\nA dependence which is somewhat in contradiction with the value G \u223c 28/A MeV for the\nconstant pairing matrix element at the Fermi level usually employed in more schematic\ntreatments of the nuclear pairing. On the other hand, if we calculate Av(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ) not with a\nWS potential but with the HO potential, we obtain a practically constant value. This may\nindicate that the A\u22121 dependence of the constant pairing matrix element is better fulfilled\nin conjunction with a harmonic potential. The difference in the behaviour with A using\nthe HO and WS potentials may come from the absence (HO) or presence (WS) of a surface\ncontribution to v(\u03b5F , \u03b5F ), like it is the case for the level density [1].\nIII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we showed how average nuclear one- and two-body matrix elements can\nvery efficiently be evaluated using the Thomas-Fermi approach. The main ingredient is to\nreplace the density matrix for a given quantum state \u03c1\u0302\u03bd = |\u03bdih\u03bd| by its counterpart averaged\nover the energy shell\n1 X\n\u03c1\u0302E =\n\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd )|\u03bdih\u03bd|\ng\u0303(E) \u03bd\n10\n\n\fwith simultaneous application of the Wigner-Kirkwood h\u0304 expansion for the smoothly varying\nspectral density \u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124) and level density g\u0303(E) = T r[\u03b4\u0303(E \u2212 \u0124)].\nWe calculated one- and two-body matrix elements restricting ourselves, in this exploratory work, to the lowest order, i.e., the pure Thomas-Fermi approximation. We compared quantal and semiclassical values of the matrix elements using harmonic oscillator and\nWoods-Saxon type of potentials. We did this also for parity projected and for angular momentum projected Thomas-Fermi theory. In all the cases close agreement with the average\nquantal behaviours was found, showing the accuracy of the method. As in the case of the\nwell tested Wigner-Kirkwood expansion of the full density matrix [1], one expects that some\nimprovement also could be achieved for the matrix elements by inclusion of h\u0304 corrections.\nWith the positive result for the single-particle matrix elements at hand, we also calculated\nthe average pairing matrix elements of some effective nuclear two-body forces. First, we used\na delta interaction and compared diagonal and off-diagonal semiclassical elements with the\ncorresponding quantal values. Again the TF values nicely reproduce the quantum results\non average. Next we estimated semiclassically the diagonal pairing matrix elements of the\nGogny D1S force at the Fermi energy. Since the Gogny force is known to reproduce very\nwell nuclear pairing properties [24], it is interesting to evaluate e.g. the A dependence of its\npairing matrix elements around the Fermi energy and to see to which extent the common\nassumption of a A\u22121 dependence holds. Using for the mean field a potential of the WoodsSaxon type, it turned out that the fall off of the pairing matrix element is stronger than\nthe A\u22121 law. For this problem we have no comparison with quantum values available, but\nthe experience with the one-body matrix elements and the pairing matrix elements for the\ndelta force, makes us believe that the values shown in fig. 6 are also reasonably accurate.\nThe stronger than A\u22121 decrease observed in fig. 6 has its origin very likely in the presence\nof a surface contribution implicit from the use of a WS potential, whereas the use of a HO\npotential with the absence of a surface shows agreement with the A\u22121 law.\nIt should be emphasized that to our knowledge the TF method to calculate average\nmatrix elements of a two-body force has never been applied before. We think that the\nconclusive study of this work will allow to use average matrix elements for the calculation\nof many nuclear quantities where fine shell effects are not needed such as optical potentials,\ngiant resonances and their widths, and many other quantities where the average trend is of\ninterest. In a future publication we will show how the application of these techniques can\nbe used to study in a very transparent way the size dependence of the average pairing gap\nin finite Fermi systems in an almost analytical way.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nP.S. wants to thank P.
