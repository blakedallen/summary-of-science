Introduction.\nIn this work we present a study of the Ermakov-Lewis invariants that are\nrelated to some linear differential equations of second order and one variable\nwhich are of much interest in many areas of physics. In particular we shall\nstudy in some detail the application of the Ermakov-Lewis formalism to\nseveral simple Hamiltonian models of \"quantum\" cosmology. There is also a\nformal application to the physical optics of waveguides.\nIn 1880, Ermakov [1] published excerpts of his course on mathematical\nanalysis where he described a relationship between linear differential equations of second order and a particular type of nonlinear equation. At the\nbeginning of the thirties, Milne [2] developed a method quite similar to the\nWKB technique where the same nonlinear equation found by Ermakov occurred, and applied it successfully to several model problems in quantum\nmechanics. Further, in 1950, the solution to this nonlinear differential equation has been given by Pinney [3].\nOn the other hand, within the study of the adiabatic invariants at the\nend of the fifties, a number of powerful perturbative methods in the phase\nspace have been developed . In particular, Kruskal [4] introduced a certain\ntype of canonical variables which had the merit of considerably simplifying\nthe mathematical approach and of clarifying some quasi-invariant structures\nof the phase space. Kruskal's results have been used by Lewis [5, 6] to prove\nthat the adiabatic invariant found by Kruskal is in fact a true invariant.\nLewis applied it to the well-known problem of the harmonic oscillator of\ntime-dependent frequency. Moreover, Lewis and Riesenfeld [7] proceeded\nto quantize the invariant, although the physical interpretation was still not\nclear even at the classical level. In other words, a constant of motion without\nmeaning was available.\nIn a subsequent work of Eliezer and Gray [8], an elementary physical\ninterpretation was achieved in terms of the angular momentum of an auxiliary two-dimensional motion. Even though this interpretation is not fully\nsatisfactory in the general case, it is the clearest at the moment.\nPresently, the Ermakov-Lewis dynamical invariants are more and more\nin use for many different time-dependent problems whose Hamiltonian is a\nquadratic form in the canonical coordinates.\n\n3\n\n\f2. The method of Ermakov.\nThe Ukrainian mathematician V. Ermakov was the first to notice that some\nnonlinear differential equations are related in a simple and definite way with\nthe second order linear differential equations. Ermakov gave as an example\nthe so-called Ermakov system for which he formulated the following theorem.\nTheorem 1E. If an integral of the equation\nd2 y\n= My\ndx2\n\n(1)\n\nis known, we can find an integral of the equation\nd2 z\n\u03b1\n= Mz + 3 ,\n2\ndx\nz\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is some constant.\n\nEliminating M from these equations one gets\ndz\ndy\nd\ny\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\ndx\n\n!\n\n=\n\n\u03b1y\n.\nz3\n\nMultiplying both sides by\n!\n\ndz\ndy\n2 y\n,\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\nthe last equation turns into\ndz\ndy\nd\ny\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n2\u03b1y d y\n.\n=\u2212\nz dx z\n\u0012 \u0013\n\nMultiplying now by dx and integrating both sides we get\ndz\ndy\ny\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n=C\u2212\n\n\u03b1y 2\n.\nz2\n\n(3)\n\nIf y1 and y2 are two particular solutions of the equation (1), substituting\nthem by y in the latter equation we get two integrals of of the equation (2)\ndz\ndy1\ny1\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n4\n\n= C1 \u2212\n\n\u03b1y12\n,\nz2\n\n\fdz\ndy2\ny2\n\u2212z\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n= C2 \u2212\n\n\u03b1y22\n.\nz2\n\nEliminating dz/dx from these equations we get a general first integral of\n(2). One should note that the Ermakov system coincide with the problem\nof the two-dimensional parametric oscillator (as we shall see in chapter 6).\nMoreover, the proof of the theorem gives an exact method to solve this\nimportant dynamical problem.\nThe general first integral of equation (2) can be also obtained as follows.\nGetting dx from equation (3):\nydz \u2212 zdy\ndx = q\n.\nC \u2212 \u03b1y 2 /z 2\n\nDividing both sides by y 2 we get the form\nz\nd\ny\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nz\n\ndx\ny\n=q 2\n.\n2\nz\ny\nC y2 \u2212 \u03b1\n\nMultiplying by C and integrating both sides we get:\nC\n\nZ\n\ndx\n+ C3 =\ny2\n\ns\n\nC\n\nz2\n\u2212\u03b1 .\ny2\n\nThis is the general first integral of equation (2), where C3 is the constant\nof the last integration. For y is enough to take any particular integral of\nequation (1).\nAs a corollary of the previous theorem we can say that\nCorollary 1Ec. If a particular solution of (2) is known, we can find the general\nsolution of equation (1).\n\nSince it is sufficient to find particular solutions of (1), we can take C = 0\nin equation (3). Thus we get:\ny\nand therefore\n\ndz\ndy\ny\u221a\n\u2212z\n=\u2213\n\u2212\u03b1.\ndx\ndx\nz\n\u221a\ndz dx \u2212\u03b1\ndy\n=\n\u00b1\n.\ny\nz\nz2\n5\n\n\fIntegrating both sides\nlog y = log z \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\nZ\n\ndx\n,\nz2\n\nwhich results in\n\nZ\n\u221a\ndx\n).\ny = z exp(\u00b1 \u2212\u03b1\nz2\nTaking the plus sign first and the minus sign next we get two particular\nsolutions of equation (1).\nA generalization of the theorem has been given by the same Ermakov.\n\nTheorem 2E. If p is some known function of x and f is any other arbitrary given\nfunction, then the general solution of the equation\n\u0012 \u0013\nd2 y\nd2 p\n1\ny\np 2 \u2212 y 2 = 2f\ndx\ndx\np\np\ncan be found by quadratures.\n\nMultiplying the equation by\n!\n\ndp\ndy\ndx\n2 p \u2212y\ndx\ndx\none gets the following form\ndy\ndp\nd p \u2212y\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n= 2f\n\n!\n\n!\n\ny\ny\nd\n.\np\np\n\nIntegrating both sides and defining for simplicity reasons\n2\n\nZ\n\nf (z)dz = \u03c6(z),\n\nwe get\ndy\ndp\np \u2212y\ndx\ndx\n\n!2\n\n!\n\ny\n+ C.\n=\u03c6\np\n\nThis is the expression for a first integral of the equation. Thus, for dx we\nhave:\npdy \u2212 ydp\n.\ndx = r \u0010 \u0011\n\u03c6 yp + C\n6\n\n\fDividing by p2 and integrating both sides we find:\nZ\n\ndx\n+ C4 =\np2\n\nZ\n\nd\n\n\u0010 \u0011\ny\np\n\nr \u0010 \u0011\n\n\u03c6\n\ny\np\n\n.\n\n+C\n\nThis is the general integral of the equation.\nA particular case is when p = x. Then, the differential equation can be\nwritten as\n\u0012 \u0013\nd2 y\ny\nx3 2 = f\n.\ndx\nx\n\n3. The method of Milne.\nIn 1930, Milne [2] introduced a method to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ntaking into account the basic oscillatory structure of the wave function.\nThis method has been one of the first in the class of the so-called phaseamplitude procedures, which allow to get sufficiently exact solutions for the\none-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation at any energy and are used to locate\nresonances.\nLet us consider the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nd2 \u03c8\n+ k 2 (x)\u03c8 = 0\n2\ndx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k 2 (x) is the local wave vector\nk 2 (x) = 2\u03bc[E \u2212 V (x)] .\n\n(2)\n\nMilne proposed to write the wave function as a variable amplitude multiplied\nby the sinus of a variable phase, i.e.,\n2\u03bc 1/2\n\u03b2(x) sin(\u03c6(x) + \u03b3)\n(3)\n\u03c0\nwhere \u03bc is the mass parameter of the problem at hand, E is the total energy\nof the system, \u03b3 is a constant phase, and V (x) is the potential energy. In\nthe original method, \u03b2 and \u03c6 are real and \u03b2 > 0. Substituting the previous\nexpression for \u03c8 in the wave equation and solving for d\u03c6/dx one gets\n\u03c8(x) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nd2 \u03b2\n1\n+ k 2 (x)\u03b2 = 3 ,\n2\ndx\n\u03b2\n7\n\n(4)\n\n\f1\nd\u03c6\n= 2 .\ndx\n\u03b2\n\n(5)\n\nAs one can see, the equation for Milne's amplitude coincides with the nonlineal equation found by Ermakov, now known as Pinney's equation.\n\n4. Pinney's result.\nIn a brief note Pinney was the first to give without proof (claimed to be\ntrivial) the connection between the solutions of the equation for the parametric oscillator and the nonlinear equation (known as Pinney's equation or\nPinney-Milne equation).\ny \u2032\u2032 (x) + p(x)y(x) +\n\nC\n(x) = 0\ny3\n\n(1)\n\nfor C = constant and p(x) given. The general solution for which y(x0 ) = y0 ,\ny \u2032(x0 ) = y0\u2032 is\nh\n\nyP (x) = U 2 (x) \u2212 CW \u22122 V 2 (x)\n\ni1/2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U and V are solutions of the linear equation\ny \u2032\u2032 (x) + p(x)y(x) = 0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nfor which U(x0 ) = y0 , U \u2032 (x0 ) = y0\u2032 ; V (x0 ) = 0, V \u2032 (x0 ) 6= y0\u2032 and W is the\nWronskian W = UV \u2032 \u2212 U \u2032 V = constant 6= 0 and one takes the square root\nin (2) for that solution which at x0 has the value y0\nThe proof is very simple as follows.

(2) we get y \u0307P = yP\u22121 (U U\u0307 \u2212\nCW \u22122 V V\u0307 ) and y \u0308P = \u2212yP\u22123 (U U\u0307 \u2212CW \u22122 V V\u0307 )2 +yP\u22121 (U\u0307 2 \u2212CW \u22122 V\u0307 2 )\u2212p(x)yP .\nFrom here, explicitly calculating y \u0308P + p(x)yP one gets \u2212CyP\u22123 and therefore\nPinney's equation.\n\n5. Lewis' results.\nIn 1967 Lewis considered parametric Hamiltonians of the standard form:\nHL = (1/2\u01eb)[p2 + \u03a92 (t)q 2 ] ,\n\n8\n\n(1)\n\n\fIf \u03a9 is real, the motion of the classical system whoose Hamiltonian is given\nby eq. (1) is oscillatory with an arbitrary high frequency when \u01eb goes to zero.\nCorresponding to this, there are asymptotic series in positive powers of \u01eb,\nwhose partial sums are the adiabatic invariants of the system; the leading\nterm of the series is \u01ebH/\u03a9. In the problem of the charged particle the adiabatic invariant is the series of the magnetic moment. Lewis's results came\nout from a direct application of the asymptotic theory of Kruskal (1962) to\nthe classical system described by HL with real \u03a9. Lewis found that Kruskal's\ntheory could be applied in exact form. As a consequence, an exact invariant,\nwhich is precisely the Ermakov-Lewis invariant, has been found as a special\ncase of Kruskal's adiabatic invariant. Although \u03a9 was originally supposed\nto be real, the final results hold for complex \u03a9 as well. Moreover, the exact\ninvariant is a constant of motion of the quantum system whose Hamiltonian\nis given by the quantum version of eq. (1).\nThe classical case.\nLet us take a real \u03a9. In order to correctly apply Kruskal's theory, it is\nnecessary to write the equations of motion as for an autonomous system of\nfirst order so that all solutions be periodic in the independent variables for\n\u01eb \u2192 0. This can be achieved by means of a new independent variable s\ndefined as s = t/\u01eb and formally considering t as a dependent variable. The\nresulting system of equations is\ndq/ds = p ,\ndp/ds = \u2212\u03a92 (t)q ,\ndt/ds = \u01eb\n\n(2)\n\nSince t is now a dependent variable, this system is autonomous. In the\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0, the solution of the last equation is t = constant, and therefore\nthe other two equations correspond to a harmonic oscillator of constant frequency. Since \u03a9 is real, the dependent variables are periodic in s of period\n2\u03c0/\u03a9(t) in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, and the system of equations has the form required\nby Kruskal's asymptotic theory. A central characteristic of the latter theory\nis a transformation from the variables (q, p, t) to the so-called \"nice variables\" (z1 , z2 , \u03c6). The latter are chosen in such a way that a two-parameter\n9\n\n\ffamily of closed curves in the space (q, p, t) can be defined by the conditions\nz1 = constant and z2 = constant. These closed curves are called rings. The\nvariable \u03c6 is a variable angle which is defined in such a way as to change\nby 2\u03c0 if any of the rings is covered once. The rings have the important feature that all the family can be mapped to itself if on each ring s is changed\naccording to eqs. (2). In the general theory, the transformation from the\nvariables (q, p, t) to the variables (z1 , z2 , \u03c6) is defined as an asymptotic series\nin positive powers of \u01eb, and a general prescription is given to determine the\ntransformation order by order. As a matter of fact, Lewis has shown one\npossible explicit form for this transformation in terms of the variables q, p\nand Pinney's function \u03c1(t). Moreover, the inverse transformation can also be\nobtained in explicit form.\nFor the parametric oscillator problem, the rings are to be found in the\nt= constant planes. It is this property that allows the usage of the rings for\ndefining the exact invariant I as the action integral\nI=\n\nI\n\nring\n\npdq .\n\n(3)\n\nBy doing explicitly the integral of I as an integral from 0 to 2\u03c0 over the\nvariable \u03c6 (see the Appendix), one gets\n1\nI = [(q 2 /\u03c12 ) + (\u03c1\u1e8b \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u0307q)2 ] ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 satisfies Pinney's equation\n\u01eb2 \u03c1\u0308 + \u03a92 (t)\u03c1 \u2212 1/\u03c13 = 0 ,\n\n(5)\n\nand the point denotes differentiation with respect to t. The function \u03c1 can be\ntaken as any particular solution of eq. (5). Although \u03a9 was supposed to be\nreal, I is an invariant even for complex \u03a9. It is easy to check that dI/dt = 0\nfor the general case of complex \u03a9 by performing the derivation of eq. (4),\nusing eqs. (2) to eliminate dq/dt and dp/dt, and eq. (5) to eliminate \u03c1\u0308.\nIt might appear that the problem of solving the system of linear equations\ngiven by eqs. (2) has been merely replaced by the problem of solving the\nnonlinear eq. (5). This is however not so. First, any particular solution of\neq. (5) can be used in the formula of I with all the initial conditions for the\neqs. (2). For the numerical work it is sufficient to find a particular solution\n10\n\n\ffor \u03c1. Second, the exact invariant has a simple and explicit dependence on\nthe dynamical variables p and q. Third, taking into account the fact that\n\u01eb2 is a factor for \u03c1\u0308 in eq. (5), one can obtain directly a particular solution\nfor \u03c1 as a series of positive powers of \u01eb2 . If \u03a9 is real and the leading term\nof the series is taken as \u03a9\u22121/2 , then the corresponding series solution is just\nthe adiabatic invariant expressed as a series. It is interesting to speculate if\nin practice it is more useful to calculate I by means of the solution written\nas a truncated series of \u03c1 or by the corresponding expression in series for I\ntruncated at the same power of \u01eb. Forth, one can also solve eq. (5) to get \u03c1\nas a power series in 1/\u01eb2 in terms of integrales. Finally, with the result of\neqs. (4) and (5), it is possible to get a better understanding of the nature of\nKruskal's adiabatic invariant. Some progress in this regard can be found in\nthe following general discussion on I and \u03c1.\nBy adding a constant factor, the invariant I of eq. (4) is the most general\nquadratic invariant of the system whose Hamiltonian given by eq. (1) is also\na homogeneous quadratic form in p and q. This can be seen by writing the\ninvariant in terms of two linear independent solutions, f (t) and g(t) of the\nparametric equation. If we write the generalized form of I\nI = \u03b4 2 [\u03c1\u22122 q 2 + (\u03c1p \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u0307q)2 ] ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is an arbitrary constant, and compare this form with that in terms\nof f (t) y g(t), then we can infer that the two invariants are identical if \u03c1 is\ngiven by\n\u03c1 = \u03b31 (\u01eb\u03b1)\u22121\n\nh A2\n\n\u03b4\n\ng2 +\n2\n\ni\nh A2 B 2\ni1/2\nB2 2\n2 1/2\nf\n+\n2\u03b3\n\u2212\n(\u01ebw)\nf\ng\n,\n2\n\u03b42\n\u03b44\n\n(7)\n\nwhere A and B are arbitrary constants, while the constants \u03b1, \u03b31 and \u03b32 are\ndefined by\n\u2032\n\u2032\nw = f g \u2212 gf , \u03b31 = \u00b11 , \u03b32 = \u00b11 .\n(8)\nSince there are two arbitrary constants, this formula for \u03c1 gives the general\nsolution of eq. (5) expressed in terms of f and g. Using this formula we can\nbuild \u03c1 explicitly for any \u03a9 for which the eqs. (2) can be solved in an exact\nmanner. By constructing \u03c1 in this way for special cases, we can infer that\nthe expansion of \u03c1 in a series of positive powers of \u01eb2 is at least sometimes\nconvergent. For example, if \u03a9 = bt\u22122n/(2n+1) , where b is a constant and n is\n11\n\n\fany integer, the series expansion is a polynomial in \u01eb2 , and consequently it\nis convergent with an infinite radius of convergence.\nOnce we have the explicit form of Kruskal's invariant, it is possible to\nfind a canonical transformation for which the new momentum is the invariant\nitself. If we denote the new coordinate by q1 , the conjugated momentum by\np1 , and the generating function by F , then the results can be written as\nq1 = \u2212tan\u22121 [\u03c12 p/q \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u03c1\u0307] ,\n1\np1 = [\u03c1\u22122 q 2 + (\u03c1p \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u0307q)2 ] ,\n2\n1\n1\nF = \u01eb\u03c1\u22121 \u03c1\u0307q 2 \u00b1 \u03c1\u22121 q(2p1 \u2212 \u03c1\u22122 q 2 )2 \u00b1 p1 sin\u22121 [\u03c1\u22121 q/(2p1 )1/2 ] + (n + )\u03c0p1\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u2212 \u2264 sin\u22121 [\u03c1\u22121 q/(2p1)1/2 ] \u2264 , n = integer ,\n2\n2\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n,\n,\nq1 =\np=\n\u2202q\n\u2202p1\n1\n\u2202F\n= \u03c1\u22122 p1 .\n(9)\n\u2202t\n\u01eb\nIn the expression for F the upper or lower signs are taken according to\np \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u22121 \u03c1\u0307q is greater or less than 0. One can see that q1 is a cyclic variable\nin the new Hamiltonian, as it should be if p1 = I can be an exact invariant.\nMoreover, Lewis noticed that the second order differential equation for q,\nnamely \u01eb2 d2 q/dt2 + \u03a92 (t)q = 0, is of the same form as the 1D Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, if t is considered as the spatial coordinate and q is taken as the\nwave function. For bound states, \u03a9 is imaginary whereas for the continuous\nspectrum \u03a9 is real. Thus, the I invariant is a relationship between the wave\nfunction and its first derivative [9].\nHnew = H +\n\nThe quantum case.\nLet us consider the quantum system with the same Hamiltonian HL , where\nq\u0302 and p\u0302 should fulfill now the commutation relations\n[q\u0302, p\u0302] = ih\u0304 .\n\n12\n\n(10)\n\n\fWe shall take \u03c1 as real, which is possible if \u03a92 is real. Using the commutation\nrelationships and the equation for \u03c1 it is easy to show that I\u02c6 is a quantum\nconstant of motion, i.e., it can be an observble since it satisfies\ndI\u02c6 \u2202 I\u02c6\n1 \u02c6\n=\n+ [I,\n\u0124] = 0 .\ndt\n\u2202t ih\u0304\n\n(11)\n\nIt follows that I has eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues are time-dependent.\nThe eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of I\u02c6 can be found by a method which\nis similar to that used by Dirac to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues\nof the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. First, we introduce the raising and\nlowering operators, \u00e2\u2020 and \u00e2, defined by\n\u221a\n\u00e2\u2020 = (1/ 2)[\u03c1\u22121 q\u0302 \u2212 i(\u03c1p\u0302 \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u0307q\u0302)] ,\n\u221a\n\u00e2 = (1/ 2)[\u03c1\u22121 q\u0302 + i(\u03c1p\u0302 \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\u0307q\u0302)] .\n(12)\nThese operators fulfill the relationships\n\n[\u00e2, \u00e2\u2020 ] = h\u0304 ,\n1\n(13)\n\u00e2\u00e2\u2020 = I\u02c6 + h\u0304 .\n2\nThe operator \u00e2 acting on an eigenfunction of I\u02c6 gives rise to an eigenfunction\nof I\u02c6 whose eigenvalue is less by h\u0304 with respect to the initial eigenvalue.\nSimilarly, \u00e2\u2020 acting on an eigenfunction of I\u02c6 raises the eigenvalue by h\u0304. Once\nthese properties are settled, the normalization of the eigenfunctions of I\u02c6 can\nbe used to prove that the eigenvalues of I\u02c6 are (n + 12 )h\u0304, where n is 0 or\na positive integer. If |ni denotes the normalized eigenfunction of I\u02c6 whose\neigenvalue is (n + 21 )h\u0304, we can express the relationhip between |n + 1i and\n|ni as follows\n|n + 1i = [(n + 1)h\u0304]\u22121/2 \u00e2\u2020 |ni .\n(14)\nThe condition that determines the eigenstate whose eigenvalue is 21 h\u0304 is given\nby\n\u00e2|0i = 0 .\n(15)\nUsing these results one can calculate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian\nin an eigenstate |ni. The result is\n1\nhn|\u0124|ni = (1/2\u01eb)(\u03c1\u22122 + \u03a92 \u03c12 + \u01eb2 \u03c1\u03072 )(n + )h\u0304 .\n2\n13\n\n(16)\n\n\fIt is interesting to note that the expectation values of \u0124 are equally spaced\nat each moment and that the lowest value is obtained for n = 0, i.e., we have\nan exact counterpart of the harmonic oscillator. As a matter of fact, we can\nobtain the harmonic oscillator results if \u03a9 is taken real and constant with\n\u03c1 = \u03a9\u22121/2 , which gives I = \u01ebH/\u03a9.\n\n6. The interpretation of Eliezer and Gray.\nThe harmonic linear motion corresponding to the 1D parametric oscillator\nequation can be seen as the projection of a 2D motion of a particle driven\nby the same law of force. Thus, the 2D auxiliary motion is described by the\nequation\nd2~r\n+ \u03a92 (t) ~r = 0\n(1)\ndt2\nwhere ~r is expressed in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Using polar coordinates\n(\u03c1, \u03b8) where \u03c1 = |r|, x = \u03c1 cos \u03b8, y = \u03c1 sin \u03b8. The radial and transversal\nmotions are described now by the equations\n\nIntegrating eq. (3)\n\n\u03c1\u0308 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8\u03072 + \u03a92 \u03c1 = 0\n\n(2)\n\n1d \u0010 2 \u0011\n\u03c1 \u03b8\u0307 = 0 .\n\u03c1 dt\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c12 \u03b8\u0307 = h\n\n(4)\n\nwhere h is the angular momentum, which is constant. Substituting in eq. (2)\none gets a Pinney equation of the form:\n\u03c1\u0308 + \u03a92 \u03c1 =\n\nh2\n\u03c13\n\n(5)\n\nThe invariant I corresponding to the eq. (5) is:\n1 h2 x2\n+ (p\u03c1 \u2212 x\u03c1\u0307)2\nI=\n2\n2 \u03c1\n\"\n\n#\n\n(6)\n\nand with the substitutions x = \u03c1 cos \u03b8 and p = \u1e8b one gets:\nI=\n\ni\n1h 2\n1\nh cos2 \u03b8 + h2 sin2 \u03b8 = h2\n2\n2\n\n14\n\n(7)\n\n\fThus, the constancy of I is equivalent to the constancy of the auxiliary\nangular momentum.\nIn the elementary classical mechanics, the study of the simple 1D harmonic oscillator is often made as the projection of the uniform circular motion\non one of its diameters. The auxiliary motion introduced by Eliezer and Gray\nis just a generalization of this elementary procedure to more general laws of\nforce.\nThe connection between the solutions of the parametric oscillator linear\nequation and Pinney's solution is given by the following theorem.\nTheorem 1EG. If y1 and y2 are linear independent solutions of the equation\nd2 y\n+ Q (x) y = 0\ndx2\n\n(8)\n\nand W is the Wronskian y1 y2\u2032 \u2212 y2 y1\u2032 (which, according to Abel's theorem is constant), then\nthe general solution of\nd2 y\n\u03bb\n+ Q (x) y = 3\n(9)\n2\ndx\ny\nwhere \u03bb is a constant, can be written as follows\n\u00011/2\n(10)\nyP = Ay1 2 + By2 2 + 2Cy1 y2\nwhere A, B and C are constants such that\n\nAB \u2212 C 2 =\n\n\u03bb\nW2\n\n(11)\n\nHowever, it is necessary that these constants be consistent with the initial\nconditions of the motion.

The connection between the Ermakov invariant and N\u00f6ther's theorem.\nIn 1978, Leach [10] found the Ermakov-Lewis invariant for the aforementioned parametric equation with first derivative\n\u1e8d + g(t)\u1e8b + \u03c9 2 (t)x = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nby making use of a time-dependent canonical transformation leading to a\nconstant new Hamiltonian. That transformation belonged to a symplectic group and has been put forth without details. In the same 1978 year,\nLutzky [11] proved that the invariant could be obtained starting from a direct application of Noether's theorem (1918). This famous theorem makes\na connection between the conserved quantities of a Lagrangian system with\nthe group of symmetries that preserves the action as an invariant functional.\nMoreover, Lutzky discussed the relationships between the solutions of the\nparametric equation of motion and Pinney's solution and commented on the\ngreat potential of the method for solving the nonlinear equations.\nFor the parametric equation without first derivative Lutzky used the following formulation of Noether's theorem.\nTheorem NL.

Next, it is easy to prove that they imply that \u03be is a\nfunction only of t and fulfills\n...\n\n\u03be +4\u03be\u03c9 \u03c9\u0307 + 4\u03c9 2\u03be \u0307 = 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe following results are easy to get\n1 \u0307\nn(x, t) = \u03bex\n+ \u03c8(t) ,\n2\n1 \u0308 2\nf (x, t) = \u03bex\n+ \u03c8\u0307x + C ,\n\u03c8\u0308 + \u03c9 2 \u03c8 = 0 .\n4\nChoosing C = 0, \u03c8 = 0, and substituting these values in (3), one can find\nthat\n1 \u0308 2  \u0307\n1\n\u2212 \u03bex\u1e8b)\n(5)\n\u03a6 = (\u03be \u1e8b2 + [\u03be\u03c9 2 + \u03be]x\n2\n2\nis a conserved quantity for the parametric undamped oscillatory motion if \u03be\nsatisfies (4). Notice that (4) has the first integral\n1\n\u03be \u03be \u0308 \u2212 \u03be \u03072 + 2\u03be 2 \u03c9 2 = C1 .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nIf we choose \u03be = \u03c12 in (5) and (6), with C1 = 1, we get that \u03a6 is the ErmakovLewis invariant. If the formula for the latter is considered as a differential\nequation for x, then it is easy to solve in the variable x/\u03c1; the result can be\nwritten in the form\nx = \u03c1[A cos \u03c6 + B sin \u03c6] ,\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(t) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0307 = 1/\u03c12 and A and B are arbitrary constants. Thus, the general\nparametric solution can be found if a particular solution of Pinney's equation\nis known.\nConsider now the Ermakov-Lewis invariant as a conserved quantity for\nPinney's equation; this is possible if x fulfills the parametric equation of\nmotion. This standpoint is interesting because it provides an example of how\nto use Noether's theorem to change a problem of solving nonlinear equations\n18\n\n\finto an equivalent problem of solving linear equations. Thus, if we take as\nour initial task to solve Pinney's equation, we can use Noether's theorem\nwith\n1\n1\nL(\u03c1, \u03c1\u0307, t) = (\u03c1\u03072 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12 \u2212 2 ) ,\n2\n\u03c1\nto prove that\ni\n\u03c12\n1 h x2\n2\n(8)\n+\nC\n+\n(\u03c1\n\u1e8b\n\u2212\n\u03c1\u0307x)\n\u03a6=\n2\n2 \u03c12\nx2\nis a conserved quantity for Pinney's equation leading to\n\u1e8d + \u03c9 2 x = C2 /x3 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe quantity C2 is an arbitrary constant; choosing C2 = 0, we reduce Pinney's solution to the parametric linear solution, while (8) turns into the\nErmakov-Lewis invariant.\nIf we write the invariant for two different solutions of the linear parametric\nequation, x1 and x2 , while keeping the same \u03c1, and eliminate \u03c1\u0307 in the resulting\nequations we get\n\u03c1=\n\n1q 2\nI1 x2 + I2 x21 + 2x1 x2 [I1 I2 \u2212 W 2 ]1/2 ,\nW\n\n(10)\n\nwhere W = \u1e8b1 x2 \u2212 x1 \u1e8b2 , and I1 and I2 are constants. Thus, a general\nsolution of Pinney's equation can be obtained if two solutions of the linear\nparametric equation can be found. (Since the Wronskian W is constant for\n2\ntwo independent linear solutions,\nq we can find that I1 = 1, I2 = W , and\ntherefore (10) turns into \u03c1 = x21 + (1/W 2 )x22 , which is the result given\nby Pinney in 1950). Moreover, one can see from (7) that two independent\nparametric solutions are x1 = \u03c1\u0303 cos \u03c6, x2 = \u03c1\u0303 sin \u03c6, where \u03c1\u0303 is any solution of\nPinney's equation. Then W = 1, and (10) turns into\nq\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303 I1 sin2 \u03c6 + I2 cos2 \u03c6 + [I1 I2 \u2212 1]1/2 sin 2\u03c6 ,\n\n\u03c6\u0307 = 1/\u03c1\u03032 . (11)\n\nThis beautiful result obtained by Lutzky by means of Noether's theorem\ngives the general solution of Pinney's equation in terms of an arbitrary particular solution of the same equation. Moreover, Lutzky suggested that this\napproach can be used to solve certain nonlinear dynamical systems once a\nconserved quantity containing an auxiliary function of a corresponding nonlinear differential equation can be found. Even if the auxiliary equation is\n19\n\n\fnonlinear, sometimes it is simpler to solve than the original linear equation.\nIn any case, one can establish useful relationships between the solutions of\nthe two types of equations.\nIn conclusion, we mention that Noether's method can be applied to the\nequation of parametric motion with first derivative (1); in this way one can reproduce the results of Eliezer and Gray of the previous chapter. The effective\nLagrangian for (1) is given by L = 12 eF (t) [\u1e8b2 \u2212 \u03c9 2(t)x2 ], where dF/dt = g(t).\n\n8. Possible generalizations of the Ermakov\nmethod.\nWe have seen that there is a simple relationship between the solutions of the\nparametric oscillator\n\u1e8d + \u03c9 2(t)x = 0 ,\n(1)\nand the solution of nonlinear differential equations of the Pinney type that\ndiffer from eq. (1) only in the nonlinear term. The equation of motion of\na charged particle in some types of time-dependent magnetic fields can be\nwritten in the above form. Many time-dependent oscillating systems are\ngoverned by the same eq. (1). A conserved quantity for eq. (1) is\n1\nIEL = [(x2 /\u03c12 ) + (\u03c1\u1e8b \u2212 \u03c1\u0307x)2 ] ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x(t) satisfies eq. (1) and \u03c1(t) satisfies the auxiliary equation\n\u03c1\u0308 + \u03c9 2 (t)\u03c1 = 1/\u03c13 .\n\n(3)\n\nUsing eq. (1) to eliminate \u03c9 2 (t) in eq. (3) we find\n\u03c1\u0308 + (\u03c1/x)\u1e8d = 1/\u03c13 ,\n\n(4)\n\nx\u03c1\u0308 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8d = (d/dt)(x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b) = x/\u03c13 .\n\n(5)\n\nor\nNow, multiplying this equation by x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b we can write\n(x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b)(d/dt)(x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b) = (x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b)x/\u03c13 ,\n20\n\n(6)\n\n\for\n\n1\n1\n(d/dt)(x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b)2 = \u2212 (d/dt)(x/\u03c12 ) ,\n2\n2\nand therefore we have the invariant\n1\nIEL = [(x2 /\u03c12 ) + (\u03c1\u1e8b \u2212 \u03c1\u0307x)2 ] ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere x is any solution of eq. (1) and \u03c1 is any solution of eq. (3).\nA simple generalization of this result has been proposed by Ray and Reid\nin 1979 [12]. Instead of (3) they considered the following equation\n\u03c1\u0308 + \u03c9 2 (t)\u03c1 = (1/x\u03c12 )f (x/\u03c1) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere x is a solution of eq. (1) and f (x/\u03c1) is an arbitrary function of x/\u03c1.\nIf again we eliminate \u03c9 2 and we employ as a factor x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b as a factor to\nobtain\n1\n(d/dt)(x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b)2 = \u2212(d/dt)\u03c6(x/\u03c1) ,\n(10)\n2\nwhere\nZ x/\u03c1\n\u03c6(x/\u03c1) = 2\nf (u)du .\n(11)\nFrom eq. (10) we have the invariant\n\n1\nIf = [\u03c6(x/\u03c1) + (\u03c1\u1e8b \u2212 \u03c1\u0307x)2 ] ,\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere x is a solution of eq. (1) and \u03c1 is a solution of eq. (9). For f = x/\u03c1 we\nreobtain the invariant IEL . The result (12) provides a connection between the\nsolutions of the linear equation (1) with the solutions of an infinite number\nof nonlinear equations (9) by means of the invariant If .\nAs an additional generalization, one can consider the following two equations\n\u1e8d + \u03c9 2 (t)x = (1/\u03c1x2 )g(\u03c1/x) ,\n(13)\n\u03c1\u0308 + \u03c9 2 (t)\u03c1 = (1/x\u03c12 )f (x/\u03c1) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere g and f are arbitrary functions of their arguments. Applying the same\nprocedure to these equations one can find the invariant\n1\nIf,g = [\u03c6(x/\u03c1) + \u03b8(\u03c1/x) + (x\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c1\u1e8b)2 ] ,\n2\n21\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03c6(x/\u03c1) = 2\n\nZ\n\nx/\u03c1\n\n\u03b8(\u03c1/x) = 2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1/x\n\nf (u)du ,\n\n(16)\n\ng(u)du .\n\n(17)\n\nThe expression (15) is an invariant whenever x is a solution of eq. (13) and\n\u03c1 is a solution of eq. (14). One should notice that the functions f and g\nare arbitrary, and therefore the invariant If,g gives the connection between\nthe solutions of many different differential equations. We can see that the\nErmakov-Lewis invariant is merely a particular case of If,g with g = 0, f =\nx/\u03c1.\nIn the cases g = 0, f = 0; g = 0, f = x/\u03c1; g = \u03c1/x, f = 0; and\nf = x/\u03c1, g = \u03c1/x the equations (13) and (14) respectively are not coupled.\nIn general, if we have found a solution for x, then the invariant If,g provides\nsome information about the solution \u03c1.\nOn the other hand, it is not known if the simple mechanical interpretation\nof Eliezer and Gray is also available for different choices of f and g. The\nsimple proof of the existence of If,g clarifies how such invariants can occur\nfrom pairs of differential equations.\n\n9. Geometrical angles and phases in the Ermakov problem.\nThe quantum mechanical holonomic effect known as Berry's phase (BP)\n(1984) has been of much interest in the last fifteen years. In the simplest\ncases, it shows up when the time-dependent parameters of a system change\nadiabatically in time in the course of a closed trajectory in the parameter\nspace. The wave functionR of the system gets, in addition to the common\ndynamical phase exp(\u2212ih\u0304 0T En (t)dt), a geometrical phase factor given by\n\u03b3n (c) = i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\ndth\u03a8n (X(t))|\n\nd\n|\u03a8n (X(t))i ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nbecause the parameters are slowly changing along the closed path c of the\nspatial parameter X(t) during the period T . |\u03a8n (X(t))i are the eigenfunctions of the instantaneous Hamiltonian H(X(t)). BP has a classical analogue\n22\n\n\fas an angular shift accumulated by the system when its dynamical variables\nare expressed in angle-action variables. This angular shift is known in the\nliterature as Hannay's angle (Hannay 1985, Berry 1985). Various model systems have been employed to calculate the BP and its classical analog. One\nof these systems is the generalized harmonic oscillator whoose H is given by\n(Berry 1985, Hannay 1985)\n1\nHXY Z (p, q, t) = [X(t)q 2 + 2Y (t)qp + Z(t)p2 ] ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the slow time-varying parameters are X(t), Y (t) y Z(t).\nSince HXY Z can be transformed into the H of a parametric oscillator, it\nfollows that there should be a connection between the BP of the system with\nHXY Z and the Lewis phase for the parametric oscillator [7]. This problem\nhas been first studied by Morales [13]. Interestingly, the results appear to be\nexact although the system does not evolve adiabatically in time and goes to\nBerry's result in the adiabatic limit.\nLewis and Riesenfeld [7] have shown that for a quantum nonstationary\nsystem which is characterized by a Hamiltonian \u0124(t) and a Hermitian in\u02c6\nvariant I(t),\nthe general solution of the Schroedinger equation\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03a8(q, t)\n= \u0124(t)\u03a8(q, t) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nis given by\n\u03a8(q, t) =\n\nX\n\nCn exp(i\u03b1n (t))\u03a8n (q, t) .\n\n(4)\n\nn\n\n\u03a8n (q, t) are the eigenfunctions of the invariant\n\u02c6 n (q, t) = \u03bbn \u03a8n (q, t) ,\nI\u03a8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the eigenvalues are time-dependent, the coefficients Cn are constants\nand the phases \u03b1n (t) are obtained from the equation\nh\u0304d\u03b1n (t)/dt = h\u03a8n |ih\u0304\u2202/\u2202t \u2212 \u0124(t)|\u03a8n i .\n\n(6)\n\nUsing this result, Lewis and Riesenfeld obtained solutions for a quantum\nharmonic oscillator of parametric frequency characterized by the classical\nHamiltonian\n1\n1\nH(t) = p2 + \u03a92 (t)q 2\n(7)\n2\n2\n23\n\n\fand the classical equation of motion\nq\u0308 + \u03a92 (t)q 2 = 0 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the points denote differentiation with respect to time. The matrix\nelements that are required to evaluate the BP are given by [7]\n1\n1\nh\u03a8n |\u2202/\u2202t|\u03a8n i = i(\u03c1\u03c1\u0308 \u2212 \u03c1\u03072 )(n + ) .\n2\n2\n1\n1\nh\u03a8n |\u0124(t)|\u03a8n i = (\u03c1\u03072 + \u03a92 (t)\u03c12 + 1/\u03c12 )(n + ) ,\n2\n2\nwhere \u03c1(t) is a real number, satisfying the equation\n\u03c1\u0308 + \u03a92 (t)\u03c1 = 1/\u03c13 .\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting (9) and (10) in (6) and integrating one gets\n1\n\u03b1n (t) = \u2212(n + )\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndt /\u03c12 (t ) .\n\n(12)\n\nOne can show this either by using (9) or (12) and one can get the BP and\nHannay's angle for the system of Hamiltonian HXY Z . For this system, the\nfrequency that can be obtained from the Hamiltonian expressed in the actionangle variables, is given by\n\u03c9 = \u2202H(I, X(t), Y (t), Z(t))/\u2202I = (XZ \u2212 Y 2 )1/2 .\n\n(13)\n\nFrom (2) one can get the equations of motion for q and p and by eliminating\np one can get the Newtonian equation of motion for q as follows\nq\u0308 \u2212 (\u017b/Z)q\u0307 + [XZ \u2212 Y 2 + (\u017bY \u2212 \u1e8e Z)/Z]q = 0 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe term in q\u0307 can be eliminated by introducing a new coordinate Q(t) given\nby (Berry 1985)\nq(t) = [Z(t)]1/2 Q(t) .\n(15)\nSubstituting (15) in (14) one gets\nQ\u0308+[XZ\u2212Y 2 +(\u017bY \u2212\u1e8e Z)/Z+[1/2(Z\u0308/Z\u2212\u017b 2 /Z 2)\u22121/4(\u017b/Z)2 ]]Q = 0 , (16)\n24\n\n\fwhich corresponds to the equation of motion of an oscillator with parametrically forced frequency. Berry found Hannay's angle \u2206\u03b8 by the WKB method\nin quantum mechanics, but it can also be obtained by means of (9) or (12).\nComparing (8) with (16) we see that we can define \u03a92 (t) as\n\u03a92 (t) = XZ \u2212 Y 2 + (\u017bY \u2212 \u1e8e Z)/Z + [1/4(Z\u0308/Z \u2212 \u017b 2 /Z 2 ) \u2212 1/4(\u017b/Z)2] . (17)\nWith this connection and employing (1) and (9) we get\n1\n1\n\u03b3n (C) = \u2212 (n + )\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\n(\u03c1\u03c1\u0308 \u2212 \u03c1\u03072 )dt ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c1(t) is the solution of (11) with \u03a92 (t) given by (17). It is important\nto notice that (18) is exact even when the system does not evolve slowly in\ntime.\nTo compare with Berry's result one should take the adiabatic limit. For\nthat we define an adiabaticity parameter \u01eb and a 'slow time' variable \u03c4\n\u03be \u2261 \u03be(\u03c4 )\n\n\u03c4 = \u01ebt ,\n\n(19)\n\nin terms of which \u03a92 (\u03c4 ) turns into\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a92 (\u03c4 ) = \u01eb\u22122 [XZ\u2212Y 2 +\u01eb(Z Y \u2212Y Z)/Z+\u01eb2 [1/2(Z /Z) \u22121/4(Z /Z)2]] , (20)\nwhere the primes indicate differentiation with respect to \u03c4 . It has been shown\nby Lewis that in the adiabatic limit eq. (20) can be solved as a power series\nin \u01eb with the leading term given by\n\u03c10 = \u03a9\u22121/2 (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(21)\n\nIf we plug this expression for \u03c1 and its time derivatives in (18) we could obtain\nthe BP in the adiabatic limit. However, it is easy to calculate the Lewis\nphase first and then resting it from the dynamical phase \u2212h\u0304\u22121 h\u03a8n |H(t)|\u03a8n i.\nSubstituting (20) and (21) in (12) we get\n1 1\n\u03b1n (\u03c4 ) = \u2212(n+ )\n2 \u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\n2 1/2\n\n(XZ \u2212 Y )\n\n1\nd\u03c4 +\n2\n\n25\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n!\n\n(Z Y \u2212 Y Z)\n\u2032\nd\u03c4 + O(\u01eb) .\n2\n1/2\nZ(XZ \u2212 Y )\n(22)\n\n\fThe first term in the right hand side is the dynamical phase and the second\nand hiher order terms are associated with Berry's phase. Therefore we can\nwrite the BP as follows\n\u017bY \u2212 \u1e8e Z\n1 ZT\n1\ndt .\n\u03b3n (C) = \u2212 (n + )\n2\n2 0 Z(XZ \u2212 Y 2 )1/2\n\n(23)\n\nHannay's angle is obtained by using the correspondence principle in the form\n(Berry 1985, Hannay 1985)\n\nas\n\n\u2206\u03b8 = \u2212\u2202\u03b3n /\u2202n ,\n\n(24)\n\n1 Z T (\u017bY \u2212 \u1e8e Z)\n\u2206\u03b8 =\ndt ,\n2 0 Z(XZ \u2212 Y 2 )1/2\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is the same result as that obtained by Berry (1985).\nIn this way, it has been proved that if a time-dependent quadratic H can\nbe transformed to the parametric form given by (7), then the Lewis phase can\nbe used to calculate the BP and the Hannay's angle. Although we presented\nthe particular case discussed by Morales, it is known that Lewis' approach\nfor time-dependent systems is general. As a matter of fact, one can find more\ngeneral cases in the literature.\n\n10. Application to minisuperspace Hamiltonian cosmology.\nThe formalism of Ermakov invariants can be a useful alternative to study\nthe evolutionary and chaoticity problems of \"quantum\" canonical universes\nsince these invariants are closely related to the Hamiltonian formulation.\nMoreover, as we have seen in the previous chapter, Ermakov's method is\nintimately related to geometrical angles and phases [27]. Therefore, it seems\nnatural to speak of Hannay's angle as well as of various types of topological\nphases at the cosmological level.\nThe Hamiltonian formulation of the general relativity has been developed\nin the classical works of Dirac [14] and Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM)\n[15]. When it was applied to the Bianchi homogeneous cosmological models\nit led to the so-called Hamiltonian cosmology [16]. Its quantum counterpart,\n26\n\n\fthe canonical quantum cosmology [17], is based on the canonical quantization\nmethods and/or path integral procedures. These cosmologies are often used\nin heuristic studies of the very early universe, close to the Planck scale epoch\ntP \u2248 10\u221243 s.\nThe most general models for homogeneous cosmologies are the Bianchi\nones. In particular, those of class A of diagonal metric are at the same time\nthe simplest from the point of view of quantizing them.\nBriefly, we can say that in the ADM formalism the metric of these models\nis of the form\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + e2\u03b1(t) (e2\u03b2(t) )ij \u03c9 i \u03c9 j ,\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1(t) is a scalar\n\u221a function\n\u221a and \u03b2ij (t)i is a diagonal matrix of dimension\n3, \u03b2ij = diag(x + 3y, x \u2212 3y, \u22122x), \u03c9 are 1-forms characterizing each of\nthe Bianchi models and fulfilling the algebra d\u03c9 i = 12 Cijk \u03c9 j \u2227 \u03c9 k , where Cijk\nare structure constants.\nThe ADM action has the form\nIADM =\n\nZ\n\n(Px dx + Py dy + P\u03b1 d\u03b1 \u2212 NH\u22a5 )dt,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the Ps are the canonical moments, N is the lapse function and\n\u0010\n\nH\u22a5 = e\u22123\u03b1 \u2212P2\u03b1 + P2x + P2y + e4\u03b1 V(x, y)\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\ne4\u03b1 V(x, y) = U(q\u03bc ) is the potential of the cosmological model under consideration. The Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation can be obtained by canonical quantization, i.e., substituting Pq\u03bc by P\u0302q\u03bc = \u2212i\u2202q\u03bc in eq. (3), where\nq\u03bc = (\u03b1, x, y). The factor ordering of e\u22123\u03b1 with the operator P\u0302\u03b1 is not unique.\nHartle and Hawking [18] suggested an almost general ordering of the following type\n\u2212e\u2212(3\u2212Q)\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 e\u2212Q\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 = \u2212e\u22123\u03b1 \u2202\u03b12 + Q e\u22123\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 ,\n(4)\nwhere Q is any real constant. If Q = 0 the WDW equation is\n\u2737 \u03a8 \u2212 U(q\u03bc ) \u03a8 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nUsing the ansatz \u03a8(q\u03bc ) = Ae\u00b1\u03a6 one gets\n\u00b1 A\u2737 \u03a6 + A[(\u2207\u03a6)2 \u2212 U] = 0,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\u2202 2\n\u2202 2\n\u2202 2\n) + ( \u2202x\n) + ( \u2202y\n) , y G\u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, 1).\nwhere \u2737 = G\u03bc\u03bd \u2202q\u03bc\u2202\u2202q\u03bd , (\u2207)2 = \u2212( \u2202\u03b1\n\n27\n\n\fEmploying the change of variable (\u03b1, x, y) \u2192 (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 ), where\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b22 = \u03b1 + x \u2212 3y,\n\u03b23 = \u03b1 \u2212 2x,\n\u03b21 = \u03b1 + x + 3y,\n\n(7)\n\nthe 1D character of some of the Bianchi models can be studied in a more\ndirect way.\nEmpty FRW (EFRW) universes for Q = 0.\nWe now apply the Ermakov method to the simplest cosmological oscillators which are the empty quantum universes of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(EFRW) type. The results included in this chapter have been published recently [19]. When the Hartle-Hawking parameter is equal to zero (Q = 0),\nthe WDW equation for the EFRW universe is\nd2 \u03a8\n\u2212 \u03bae\u22124\u03a9 \u03a8(\u03a9) = 0 ,\n(8)\n2\nd\u03a9\nwhere \u03a9 is the Misner time which is related to the volume of the universe\nV at a given cosmological epoch as \u03a9 = \u2212 ln(V 1/3 ) [20], \u03ba is the curvature\nparameter of the universe (1,0,-1 for closed, plane, open universes, respectively) and \u03a8 is the wave function of the universe. The general solution is\nobtained as a linear superposition of modified Bessel functions of zero order\nin the case for which \u03ba = 1, \u03a8(\u03a9) = C1 I0 ( 12 e\u22122\u03a9 ) + C2 K0 ( 21 e\u22122\u03a9 ). If \u03ba = \u22121\nthe solution will be a superposition of ordinary Bessel functions of zero order\n\u03a8(\u03a9) = C1 J0 ( 21 e\u22122\u03a9 ) + C2 Y0 ( 12 e\u22122\u03a9 ). C1 and C2 are arbitrary superposition\nconstants that we shall take for simplicity reasons equal C1 = C2 = 1.\nEq. (8) can be transformed into the canonical equations of motion for a\nclassical point particle of mass M = 1, generalized coordinate q = \u03a8 and\n\u2032\nmoment p = \u03a8 , and by considering Misner's time as a Hamiltonian time for\nwhich we shall keep the same notation. Thus, we can write\ndq\n= p\n(9)\nd\u03a9\ndp\n= \u03bae\u22124\u03a9 q .\n(10)\nd\u03a9\nThese equations describe the canonical motion of an inverted oscillator (\u03ba =\n1) and of a normal one (\u03ba = \u22121), respectively [21], of Hamiltonian\nH(\u03a9) =\n\np2\nq2\n\u2212 \u03bae\u22124\u03a9 .\n2\n2\n28\n\n(11)\n\n\fFor the EFRW Hamiltonian the phase space functions T1 =\n2\nT3 = q2 form a dynamical Lie algebra, i.e.,\nH=\n\nX\n\np2\n,\n2\n\nT2 = pq, y\n\nhn (\u03a9)Tn (p, q) ,\n\n(12)\n\nn\n\nwhich is closed with respect to the Poisson brackets {T1 , T2 } = \u22122T1 , {T2 , T3 } =\n\u22122T3 , {T1 , T3 } = \u2212T2 . The Hamiltonian EFRW Hamiltonian can be written\nnow as\nH = T1 \u2212 \u03bae4\u03a9 T3 .\n(13)\nThe Ermakov invariant I is a function in the dynamical algebra\nI=\n\nX\n\n\u01ebr (\u03a9)Tr ,\n\n(14)\n\nr\n\nand through the time invariance condition\n\u2202I\n= \u2212{I, H} ,\n\u2202\u03a9\n\n(15)\n\none is led to the following equations for the unknown functions \u01ebr (\u03a9)\n\u01eb\u0307r +\n\n\"\nX X\nn\n\nm\n\nr\nCnm\nhm (\u03a9)\n\n#\n\n\u01ebn = 0 ,\n\n(16)\n\nr\nwhere Cnm\nare the structure constants of the Lie algebra given above.

We have worked with\nthe values A = 1, B = \u22121/W 2 y C = 0 for Pinney's constants, where W\nis the Wronskian of the Bessel functions. We have also chosen an auxiliary\nangular moment of unit value (h = 1). Since I = h2 /2,we have to obtain a\nconstant value of one-half for the Ermakov invariant. We have checked this\nby plotting I(\u03a9) for \u03ba = \u00b11 in fig. 1.\nNow we pass to the calculation of the angular variables.

With these temporal limits for the\ncosmological evolution, one finds that the variation of the total angle \u2206\u03b8 is\nbasically the same as the Laplace transformation of 1/\u03c12 : \u2206\u03b8 = \u2212L1/\u03c12 (Q).\nThe plots of the invariant and of the variations of the angular quantities\nare shown next, both for the closed EFRW universes as for the open ones.\nR\n\n\u2032\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n0.4 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nOmega\n\n4\n\n5\n\n+\nfig. 5: IEFRW\n(\u03a9) for Q = 3 and an initial singularity of unit auxiliary angular momentum.\n\n35\n\n\f0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n00\n\n0.5\n\n1\nomega\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\nfig. 6: The dynamical angle as a function of \u03a9 for a closed EFRW universe and Q = 1.\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n00\n\n0.5\n\n1\nomega\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-0.2\n\nfig. 7: The geometrical angle for the same case.\n\n36\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n00\n\n0.5\n\n1\nomega\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nfig. 8: The total angle as a function of \u03a9 for the same case.\n\n2.1\n\n2.08\n\n2.06\n\n2.04\n\n2.02\n\n2\n\n1.98\n\n1.96\n\n1.94\n\n1.92\n\n1.9 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nOmega\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u2212\nfig. 9: IEFRW\n(\u03a9) with Q = 1 for an initial singularity of auxiliary angular momentum excitation h = 2.\n\n37\n\n\f0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n00\n\n0.5\n\n1\nomega\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\nfig. 10: The dynamical angle as a function of \u03a9 for an open EFRW universe of Q = 1.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n00\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nomega\n\nfig. 11: The geometrical angle as a function of \u03a9 for the same case.\n\n38\n\n\f0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n00\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nomega\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nfig. 12: The total angle as a function of \u03a9 for the same open case.\n\nSomewhat more complicated cosmological models\nWe sketch now the Taub pure gravity model whose WDW equation reads\n\u22022\u03a8 \u22022\u03a8\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2212\n+\nQ\n+ e\u22124\u03a9 V (\u03b2)\u03a8 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u03a92\n\u2202\u03b2 2\n\u2202\u03a9\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (\u03b2) = 31 (e\u22128\u03b2 \u2212 4e\u22122\u03b2 ).

The WDW equation is\n[\u2202\u03a92 + Q\u2202\u03a9 \u2212 \u2202\u03c62 \u2212 \u03bae\u22124\u03a9 + m2 e\u22126\u03a9 \u03c62 ]\u03a8(\u03a9, \u03c6) = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nand can be written as a Schroedinger equation for a two-component wave\nfunction (see [23]). This allows to think of squuezed cosmological states in\nthe Ermakov framework [24]. For this, we shall use the following factorization\nof the invariant I = h\u0304(bb\u2020 + 12 ), where b = (2h\u0304)\u22121/2 [ \u03c1q + i(\u03c1p \u2212 eQc \u03a9 \u03c1\u0307q)]\nand b\u2020 = (2h\u0304)\u22121/2 [ \u03c1q \u2212 i(\u03c1p \u2212 eQc \u03a9 \u03c1\u0307q)]. Qc is a fixed ordering parameter.\nConsider now a Misner reference oscillator of frequency \u03c90 corresponding\nto a given cosmological epoch \u03a90 for which one can introduce the standard\nfactorization operators a = (2h\u0304\u03c90 )\u22121/2 [\u03c90 q + ip], a\u2020 = (2h\u0304\u03c90 )\u22121/2 [\u03c90 q \u2212 ip].\nThe connection between the two pairs a and b is b(\u03a9) = \u03bc(\u03a9)a + \u03bd(\u03a9)a\u2020 y\nb\u2020 (\u03a9) = \u03bc\u2217 (\u03a9)a\u2020 + \u03bd \u2217 (\u03a9)a\u2020 , where \u03bc(\u03a9) = (4\u03c90 )\u22121/2 [\u03c1\u22121 \u2212 ieQc \u03a9 \u03c1\u0307 + \u03c90 \u03c1]\nand \u03bd(\u03a9) = (4\u03c90 )\u22121/2 [\u03c1\u22121 \u2212 ieQc \u03a9 \u03c1\u0307 \u2212 \u03c90 \u03c1] satisfy the relationship |\u03bc(\u03a9)|2 \u2212\n|\u03bd(\u03a9)|2 = 1. The uncertainties can be calculated (\u2206q)2 = 2\u03c9h\u03040 |\u03bc\u2212\u03bd|2 , (\u2206p)2 =\nh\u0304\u03c90\n|\u03bc + \u03bd|2 , and (\u2206q)(\u2206p) = h\u03042 |\u03bc + \u03bd||\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd| showing that in general these\n2\nErmakov states are not of minimum uncertainty [24].\nThe way one should do the linear combinations for the solutions\nof the linear differential equations.\nAs it has been shown, in order to solve Pinney's equation one should first\nfind the solutions to the equations of motion. Since these equations are linear, we have chosen those combinations which satisfy the initial conditions\nof motion. According to the interpretation of Eliezer and Gray, the solution of Pinney's equation is just the amplitude of the 2D auxilliary motion.\nTherefore, two of the three quadratic terms of the solution can be seen as\nthe amplitudes along each of the axes, respectively. The third one is a mixed\nterm (one can also eliminate it by diagonalizing the quadratic form in the\nsquare root).\nLet q(0) = a and q\u0307(0) = b be the initial conditions for the equation of\nmotion. The solution can be written as x (t) = ax1 (t) + bx2 (t), and therefore\nthe functions x1 y x2 must satisfy the conditions x1 (0) = 1, \u1e8b1 (0) = 0,\nx2 (0) = 0, \u1e8b2 (0) = 1. If we take \u03c81 and \u03c82 as a pair of linear independent\nsolutions of the parametric equation, then we can build the functions xi\n40\n\n\fas linear combinations of \u03c8i : xi = ai \u03c81 + bi \u03c82 . It is clear that the linear\nsuperpositions that satisfy the initial conditions will be:\nx1 =\nx2 =\n\ni\n1 h \u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c82 (0)\u03c81 (t) \u2212 \u03c81 (0)\u03c82 (t)\nW (0)\n\n(1)\n\n1\n[\u2212\u03c82 (0)\u03c81 (t) + \u03c81 (0)\u03c82 (t)]\nW (0)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere W (0) is the Wronskian of the functions \u03c81 and \u03c82 evaluated at zero\ntime parameter. The functions xi are the correct ones that should enter the\nsolution of Pinney's equation written in the form given by Eliezer and Gray.\nIn this way, we have in the case of the cosmological models that have been\ndiscussed:\nQ\ni\n(2z) 4 h \u2032\n\u2032\nx1 =\n(3)\n\u03c81 (1/2)K Q (z) \u2212 \u03c82 (1/2)I Q (z)\n4\n4\n2\nQ\n\ni\n(2z) 4 h\nK Q (1/2)I Q (z) \u2212 I Q (1/2)K Q (z)\nx2 =\n4\n4\n4\n4\n2\n\nwhere\n\n(4)\n\n1\nz = e\u22122\u03a9 ,\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nQ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c81 (1/2) = \u2212\nI Q (1/2) + I Q (1/2) ,\n4\n2 4\n\u0014\n\u0015\nQ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c82 (1/2) = \u2212\nK Q (1/2) + K Q (1/2) ,\n4\n2 4\nfor closed EFRW, and similarly for the open EFRW models.\nThe superposition coefficients we worked with are of the form a+ =\nNK (1/2)/D+ (1/2), b+ = NI (1/2)/D+ (1/2), c+ = \u2212K(1/2)/D+ (1/2), d+ =\nI(1/2)/D+ (1/2), where NK (1/2) = K Q +1 (1/2) \u2212 QK Q (1/2), NI (1/2) =\n4\n4\nI Q +1 (1/2)+QK Q (1/2), and D+ (1/2) = I Q +1 (1/2)K Q (1/2)+K Q +1 (1/2)I Q (1/2)\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\nfor the closed EFRW case; a\u2212 = \u2212NY (1/2)/D\u2212 (1/2), b\u2212 = NJ (1/2)/D\u2212 (1/2),\nc\u2212 = Y (1/2)/D\u2212 (1/2), d\u2212 = \u2212J(1/2)/D\u2212 (1/2), where NY (1/2) = Y Q +1 (1/2)\u2212\n4\nQY Q (1/2), NJ (1/2) = J Q +1 (1/2)+QJ Q (1/2), and D\u2212 (1/2) = J Q +1 (1/2)Y Q (1/2)\u2212\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\nY Q +1 (1/2)J Q (1/2) for the open EFRW case.\n4\n\n4\n\n41\n\n\f11. Application to physical optics.\nIn order to study the Ermakov procedure within physical optics, our starting\npoint will be the 1D Helmholtz equation in the form given by Goyal et al\n[25] and Delgado et al [26]\nd2 \u03c8\n+ \u03bb\u03c6(x)\u03c8(x) = 0 ,\ndx2\n\n(1)\n\nthat is, as a Sturm-Liouville equation for the set of eigenvalues \u03bb \u2208 R defining the Helmholtz spectrum within a closed given interval [a,b] on the real\nline, where the nontrivial function \u03c8 turns to zero at the end points (Dirichlet boundary conditions). Eq. (1) occurs, for example, in the case of the\ntransversal electric modes (TE) propagating in waveguides that have a continuously varying refractive index in the x direction but are independent of\ny and z. Similar problems in acoustics can be treated along the same lines.\nThe transformation of eq. (1) into the canonical equations of motion of a\nclassical pointparticle is performed as follows. Let \u03c8(x) by any real solution\n\u2032\nof eq. (1). Define x = t, \u03c8 = q, and \u03c8 = p; then, eq. (1) turns into\ndq\n= p\ndt\ndp\n= \u2212\u03bb\u03c6(t)q ,\ndt\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwith the boundary conditions q(a) = q(b) = 0. The corresponding classical\nHamiltonian\np2\nq2\nH(t) =\n+ \u03bb\u03c6(t) .\n(4)\n2\n2\nis similar to the previous cosmological case of Q = 0, if one identifies \u03bb = \u2212\u03ba\nand \u03c6 = e\u22124\u03a9 . The procedure to find the Ermakov invariant follows step\nby step the cosmological case. In the phase space algebra we can write the\ninvariant as\nX\nI=\n\u03bcr (t)Tr ,\n(5)\nr\n\nand applying\n\n\u2202I\n= \u2212{I, H} ,\n\u2202t\n42\n\n(6)\n\n\fwe get the system of equations for the coefficients \u03bcr (t)\n\u03bc\u03071 = \u22122\u03bc2\n\u03bc\u03072 = \u03bb\u03c6(t)\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc3\n\u03bc\u03073 = 2\u03bb\u03c6(t)\u03bc2 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe solutions can be written in the conventional form by choosing \u03bc1 = \u03c12 ,\nthat gives \u03bc2 = \u2212\u03c1\u03c1\u0307 and \u03bc3 = \u03c1\u03072 + \u03c112 , where \u03c1 is a solution of the Pinney's\nequation of the form: \u03c1\u0308+\u03bb\u03c6(t)\u03c1 = \u03c113 , with the Ermakov invariant of the well2\n\n2\n\nq\nknown form I = (\u03c1p\u22122\u03c1\u0307q) + 2\u03c1\n2 .

For this case, Lewis obtained a\nsimple formula for \u03c1 of O(1) order in 1/ \u03bb\n\u221a #1\n1\n\u03b32 \u03c0 \u03bb 2 1 (1)\n(2)\n\u03c1m = \u03b31\nt 2 [H\u03b2 (y)H\u03b2 (y)] 2 ,\n(m + 2)\n\"\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(25)\n\nwhere H\u03b2 and H\u03b2 are Hankel functions of order \u03b2 = 1/(m + 2), y =\n\u221a\n2b \u03bb m\nt 2 +1 , and \u03b31 = \u00b11, \u03b32 = \u00b11. An even more useful technological\n(m+2)\n45\n\n\f4n\n, n =\napplication might be the following proposal of Lewis: m = \u2212 2n+1\n\u00b11, \u00b12, ..., leading to\n\n\u221a\n1\nn\n1\n\u03c1n = \u03b31 \u03b322 b\u2212 2 t 2n+1 |G(t, 1/ \u03bb)|2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\n\u221a\n\" n\n#1\n\u0010\n\u0011k\n2\n\u221a\nX\nk\n(n\n+\nk)!\n\u03bb\n1/\n\u2212\nG(t, 1/ \u03bb) =\n(\u22121)k\n.\nt (2n+1)\nk!(n \u2212 k)! 2ib(2n + 1)\nk=0\n\n(27)\n\nOne gets \u03c1 as a polynomial in the square of the adiabatic parameter, i.e.,\n\u03bb\u22121 , of infinite radius of convergence. The topological quantities (angles\nand phases) can be calculated by substituting the explicit form of Pinney 's\nfunction in the corresponding formulas. Lewis [6] found a recursive formula\nin 1/\u03bb of order 1/\u03bb3 that can be used for any type of index profile. The\nrecurrence relationship is\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03c11 /\u03bb + \u03c12 /\u03bb2 + \u03c13 /\u03bb3 + ... ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03c10 = \u03a9\u22121/2 = \u03c6\u22121/4 (x); for the other coefficients \u03c1i see the appendix\nin [6]. The main contribution to the topological quantities are given by \u03c10 .\nIn the case of a power-law index profile, the geometric angle is\n\"\n\n#\n\nm\nm\n\u2212( m +1)\n\u2206\u03b8 = \u2212\n,\nt\u2212( 2 +1) \u2212 t0 2\n4b(m + 2)\n\ng\n\n(29)\n\nand a similar formula can be written for the geometric quantum phase. For\nperiodic indices, one can write the Hannay angle and Berry's phase according to their cyclic integral expressions. Finally, we notice that the choice\n\u03c6(x) = \u03a6(x) + Const\n, which corresponds to nonlinear waveguides, leads to\n\u03c83 (x)\nmore general time-dependent Hamiltonians that have been discussed in the\nErmakov perspective by Maamache [28].\nWe have presented in a formal way the application of the Ermakov approach\nto 1D Helmholtz problems. For more detailes one can look in a recent work\nby Rosu and Romero [29].\n\n46\n\n\f12. Conclusions.\nAs one could see from the examples we discussed in this work, the ErmakovLewis quadratic invariants are an important method of research for parametric oscillator problems. They are helpful for better understanding this\nwidespreaded class of phenomena with applications in many areas of physics.\nOne can also say that the Ermakov approach gives a connection between\nthe linear physics of parametric oscillators and the corresponding nonlinear\nphysics.\nThe cosmological applications of the classical Ermakov procedure we presented herein are based on a classical particle representation of the WDW\nequation for the EFRW models. We also notice that the Ermakov invariant is\nequivalent to the Courant-Snyder invariant of use in the accelerator physics\n[30], allowing an analogy between the physics of beams and the cosmological\nevolution as suggested by Rosu and Socorro [31].\nWe end up with a possible interpretation of the Ermakov invariant within\nthe empty minisuperspace cosmology. If one performs an expansion of the\ninvariant in a power series in the adiabatic parameter, the principal term\nwhich defines the adiabatic regime gives the number of adiabatic \"quanta\"\nand there were authors who gave classical descriptions of the cosmological\nparticle production in such terms [32]. On the other hand, the Eliezer-Gray\ninterpretation as an angular momentum of the 2D auxiliary motion allows one\nto say that for EFRW minisuperspace models, the Ermakov invariant gives\nthe number of adiabatic excitations of the auxiliary angular momentum with\nwhich the universe is created at the initial singularity.\n\n47\n\n\fAppendix A: Calculation of the integral of I.\nThe phase space integral of I in chapter 5 can be calculated from the formula\n(15a) in the paper of Lewis [6]\n1 Z 2\u03c0\n\u2202X1\nI=\u2212\nX2\nd\u03c6\n2\u03c0 0\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere X1 and X2 represent the functional dependences of q and p, respectively, in terms of the nice variables z1 and \u03c6, which have been given by\nLewis in the formulas (38) of the same paper as follows\nX1 = \u00b1\nand\nX2 = \u00b1\n\nz1\nF1 \u03a9[1 + tan2 (\u03c6 \u2212 F2 )]1/2\n\nln \u03c1\n+\nz1 [\u01eb d dt\n\n1\ntan(\u03c6\n\u03c12\n2\n\n\u2212 F2 )]\n\nF1 \u03a9[1 + tan (\u03c6 \u2212 F2 )]1/2\n\n(2)\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere F1 and F2 are two arbitrary functions of time.
