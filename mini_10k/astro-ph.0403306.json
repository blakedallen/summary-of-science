Introduction\nObservations of close binary systems have shown that a star\nwhich is illuminated by its companion can exhibit a hotter, illuminated, and a cooler, unilluminated side (see, e.g., Eddington\n1926; Ritter et al. 2000, and references therein). This is the\nwell-known reflection effect (for a review see Vaz 1985). If the\nilluminated star has a convective envelope, then irradiation inhibits the energy transport through the illuminated outer layers\n(Vaz & Nordlund 1985). In the case of a semi-detached compact binary system the reflection effect can be caused by accretion luminosity that is released nearby the compact star. In\nthis case the energy transport, i.e., the intrinsic flux through\nthe illuminated outer layers of the donor star is coupled to the\nmass transfer rate. This leads to a feedback, the consequences\nof which are the subject of this paper.\nThe influence of irradiation onto mass transfer was first\ndiscussed by Podsiadlowski (1991) for the simplified case\nof symmetrical irradiation of the donor. Later, Hameury et al.\n(1993) tried to simulate asymmetrical irradiation by timeSend offprint requests to: Hans Ritter,\ne-mail: hsr@mpa-garching.mpg.de\n\nperiodic symmetric irradiation and concluded that a more realistic model is required.\nIn a series of papers Ritter et al. (1995, 1996); King et al.\n(1995, 1996) developed a feedback model for asymmetrical irradiation that predicts under which conditions the secular mass\ntransfer rate becomes unstable and the system undergoes mass\ntransfer cycles which occur on a thermal timescale of the convective envelope of the donor star.\nWe reexamine the above-mentioned irradiation feedback\nmodel and take into account a contribution of the thermal relaxation which is not related to the irradiation of the donor star. It\nturns out that this term, which was neglected in previous studies\nof the above-mentioned analytical model, can become important, especially for giant donors.\nUnfortunately, there have been basically no numerical\ncomputations to test the validity of this model and especially the boundaries of the stable and unstable regions. Only\nfew computations have been carried out by using bipolytrope stellar models and in most cases also by using simplified models for the treatment of irradiation (Ritter et al. 1995;\nMcCormick & Frank 1998; Ritter et al. 2000). There has been\nonly one short-term evolution using full 1D stellar models and\na realistic treatment of irradiation which was published by\n\n\f2\n\nAndreas B\u00fcning and Hans Ritter: Long-term evolution of compact binaries . . .\n\nHameury & Ritter (1997). It has served more as a \"proof of\nconcept\" for their model of the reduction of the intrinsic flux\nby illumination than as a numerical confirmation of the irradiation feedback model.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to confirm the predictions\nof the irradiation feedback model by numerical long-term evolutionary computations that are based on full 1D stellar models\nfor the donor star, a realistic model for the irradiation geometry, and tabulated results of Hameury & Ritter (1997) for the\nreduction of the intrinsic flux by illumination.\nIn Sect. 2 we mention the input physics that is necessary\nfor the feedback model and for the numerical computations.\nThis includes the mass loss rate prescription, the reflection effect, the irradiation geometry, and the thermal relaxation of the\ndonor star. Afterwards, in Sect. 3 we develop two ordinary differential equations which describe the system adequately for\nour purpose, and in Sect. 4 we derive the conditions which describe the onset of instability by means of linear stability analysis.\nWe give a short overview in Sect. 5 about input physics,\nwhich we use in our code, and subsequently, we present our\nnumerical results for CVs and LMXBs containing evolved and\nunevolved donor stars in Sect. 6.\n\nWe consider a semi-detached compact binary system. The compact primary star, a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole,\nis denoted by subscript 1, the secondary star, a main sequence\nstar with a convective envelope or a giant, by subscript 2. Both\nstars move on circular orbits with an orbital distance A. We assume that the secondary corotates with the orbital motion. This\nis justified by the short timescales of orbital circulatization and\nsynchronization for such systems (e.g., Zahn 1977). The mass\nratio of both stars is defined as\nM2\n.\nM1\n\n(1)\n\nThe secondary almost fills its critical Roche lobe and therefore\nloses mass through the inner Lagrangian point L1 to its compact\ncompanion.\n\n2.1. The mass transfer rate\nSince the donor star does not have a sharp rim, the mass loss\nrate must be a continuous function of the difference\n\u2206R = R2 \u2212 RR,2\n\nWe note that in (3) the characteristic scale length is H = HP\nand that HR2P is of order \u223c 10\u22124 for low-mass MS stars and up to\n\u223c 10\u22122 for giants.\n\n2.2. The accretion geometry and the irradiating flux\nWe assume that the matter streaming through the L1 -point is\ncollected in an accretion disk surrounding the primary and that\na fraction 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1 of the transferred matter is finally accreted,\ni.e.:\n\u1e401 = \u2212\u03b7 \u1e402 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe fraction 1 \u2212 \u03b7 is lost from the system and carries away\nangular momentum, which is parametrized in terms of\nd ln J\n,\n(6)\nd ln M\nwhere J is the orbital angular momentum and M = M1 + M2 the\ntotal mass of the system. This mode of orbital angular momentum loss is usually referred to as consequential angular momentum loss (CAML, see, e.g., King & Kolb 1995). If the matter is\nlost with the specific orbital angular momentum of the primary,\nthen \u03bd = q.\nThe accretion process releases gravitational energy and\nproduces accretion luminosity, mostly on or nearby the compact star so that the source of the accretion luminosity can be\ntreated as a point source. Hence, the irradiating flux at a distance d is given by\n\u03bd=\n\n2. Input physics\n\nq=\n\nonly to a donor star which slightly underfills its Roche lobe.\nThis is the case for most of the systems we are interested in. In\nany case, the conclusions of this paper are independent of the\nexact form of the mass transfer prescription as long as the characteristic scale length H, on which \u1e402 increases by a factor of\ne, fulfills\n!\u22121\n1 d \u1e402\n\u226a R2 .\n(4)\nH :=\n\u1e402 d\u2206R\n\n(2)\n\nbetween the radius R2 and the Roche radius RR,2 of the star.\nFor computing the mass loss rate we use\n!\n\u2206R\n\u1e402 = \u2212 \u1e400 exp\n,\n(3)\nHP\nwhere \u1e400 > 0 is a weakly varying function of the system parameters M1 , M2 , A, and the photospheric values of the donor,\nand HP denotes the photospheric pressure scale height (for details see Ritter 1988). Strictly speaking, Eq. (3) is applicable\n\nFirr =\n\n\u03b1accr \u0393M1\n\u1e401 .\n4\u03c0d2 R1\n\n(7)\n\n\u0393 is the gravitational constant, and \u03b1accr takes into account that\nthe gravitational energy is not necessarily completely released\nas accretion luminosity and that the accretion luminosity is not\nnecessarily radiated isotropically with respect to the primary.\nOn the long term the system can lose additional matter and\nangular momentum, e.g., by nova explosions so that the longterm average value \u03b7\u0304 can be less than \u03b7, even \u03b7\u0304 < 0 is possible (e.g., Hameury et al. 1989; Prialnik & Kovetz 1995). In\nthis case \u03b7\u0304 determines the (long-term) mass and angular momentum balance while \u03b7 determines the momentary accretion\nrate and therefore the accretion luminosity. As has been shown\nby Schenker et al. (1998), describing the long-term evolution\nby an average \u03b7\u0304 is reasonable.\n\n2.3. The reflection effect and the intrinsic flux\nA star that is illuminated by its companion shows a reflection\neffect (for a review see Vaz 1985). Accordingly, the star has\n\n\fAndreas B\u00fcning and Hans Ritter: Long-term evolution of compact binaries . . .\n\nan illuminated, brighter and hotter side with an irradiationdependend effective temperature T irr and an unilluminated,\ndarker and cooler side with an effective temperature T 0 . The intrinsic flux Fint through a surface element is defined as the net\nflux, i.e., the difference between the incoming flux Firr and the\n4\noutgoing flux \u03c3T irr\n, where \u03c3 denotes the Stephan-Boltzmann\nconstant. It is convenient to write the irradiating flux in units of\nthe intrinsic flux F0 = \u03c3T 04 on the unilluminated side:\nfirr =\n\nFirr\n.\nF0\n\n(8)\n\nTypically, the reflection effect is discussed in terms of the\nbolometric reflection albedo\nwbol =\n\n4\n\u03c3T irr\n\u2212 \u03c3T 04\nFirr\n\n(9)\n\nbut for the purpose of this paper it is more convenient to use\nthe intrinsic flux in units of F0 :\nfint =\n\n4\n4\n\u2212 Firr T irr\nFint \u03c3T irr\n=\n= 4 \u2212 firr .\nF0\nF0\nT0\n\n(10)\n\nFor stars in radiative equilibrium the irradiating flux firr is reprocessed and completely reemitted. They show wbol = 1 and\nfint = 1 all over the surface. Stars with convective envelopes\nare by definition not in radiative equilibrium and for them wbol\nand fint can be less than unity.\nConvection in the interior of stars is efficient, i.e., adiabatic.\nIt was first stated by Ruci\u0144ski (1969) that the entropy, which\nis constant in the adiabatic convection zone, must determine\nthe intrinsic flux through the outer layers. This means that, as\nwas first recognized by Vaz & Nordlund (1985), the temperature gradient must be flatter on the illuminated, hotter side than\non the unilluminated, cooler side: Since the temperature gradient in the adiabatic convection zone is essentially tied to the\nadiabatic temperature gradient, the temperature gradient in the\nsubphotospheric, superadiabatic layers must be flatter on the illuminated side. Therefore, energy transport through the illuminated outer layers is inhibited. In fact, the superadiabatic zone\nacts like a valve for the energy flow. This can be unterstood in\nterms of a simple one-zone model (Ritter et al. 1995, 2000).\nRitter et al. (2000, App. A) have pointed out that lateral\nenergy transport within the superadiadiabatic convection zone\nis negligible since the radial temperature gradient in the superadiabatic layers is much larger than the lateral temperature\ngradient. Hence, irradiation can be treated as a local effect and\nfor every surface element separately. While this is most likely\na good approximation for weak irradiation, i.e., typical CVs,\nit is possible that for sufficiently strong irradiation, i.e., typical LMXBs, non-local effects like circulations, which transport heat from the illuminated to the unilluminated side, become non-negligible. We will discuss this topic in more detail\nin Sec. 6.4.\nBy solving the equations of stellar structure for an unirradiated and an irradiated surface element simultaneously for a\nfixed entropy at the bottom of the adiabatic zone it is possible to compute fint ( firr ) numerically. This has been done by\n\n3\n\nHameury & Ritter (1997)1 for grey atmospheres and perpendicular irradiation for a large grid of effective temperature T 0\n2\n. The results are available in tabular\nand surface gravity g = \u0393M\nR22\nform and we use them for our numerical calculations.\nThe assumption of a grey atmosphere and an irradiated\nPlanck spectrum is not necessarily very accurate, especially\nfor CVs and LMXBs. Various properties like a different penetration depth of optical light, UV and X-rays are neglected. A\nsmaller penetration depth means that the external radiation field\nis mainly absorbed and reprocessed in the optically thin2 layers of the atmosphere. This reduces the effect of the irradiation\non the photospheric boundary conditions and therefore the intrinsic flux is less inhibited. This \"efficiency\" of the irradiation\nfor a non-grey atmosphere compared to a grey atmosphere will\nbe taken into account formally by a free parameter \u03b1irr . If the\nexternal radiation field has the same spectrum as the irradiated\nstar, then \u03b1irr is unity by definition. In the case of LMXBs hard\nX-rays, which can penetrate into the subphotospheric layers,\ncan be the dominant component of the irradiating spectrum.\nBut since even\n\u0010 \u0011 in the case of a grey atmosphere (i.e., \u03b1irr = 1)\nabout exp \u2212 32 \u2248 21 of the irradiating flux penetrates directly\ndown to the photosphere at an optical depth of \u03c4 = 32 (see e.g.,\nTout et al. 1989, Eq. 29) and since even hard X-rays, except for\nthe most energetic photons, do not penetrate sufficiently deep\ninto the outer layers (Hameury 1996), we do not expect that \u03b1irr\ncan become significantly greater than unity in typical LMXBs.\nTherefore, in general \u03b1irr . 1.\nModels of non-grey atmospheres irradiated by Planck spectra (Nordlund & Vaz 1990; Brett & Smith 1993) and real stellar\nspectra (Barman & Hauschildt 2001, 2002; Barman 2002) have\nbeen computed. However, those computations are much too\ntime-consuming for generating tables that would be applicable for our purpose, i.e., similar to those by Hameury & Ritter\n(1997). Nevertheless, it is possible to compare models of irradiated non-grey atmospheres with models of irradiated grey\natmospheres to get an estimate for the irradiation efficiency \u03b1irr .\nSince fint depends on the penetration depth, irradiation is\nmore efficient for a smaller opacity and thus for a smaller\nmetallicity. Fig. 1 shows fint as a function of metallicity for a\nspecific binary system. Since the source radiates mainly in the\noptical, the results for grey atmospheres (crosses) do not differ much from those for non-grey atmospheres of the irradiated\nstar, for an irradiated Planck spectrum (triangles) as well as for\na real stellar spectrum (diamonds). The data shown are taken\nfrom Nordlund & Vaz (1990, table 1) and are compared with\nresults from Hameury & Ritter (1997) (asterisk).\nThe reduction of fint by irradiation also depends on the\nmodel of convection, especially the mixing length l as shown in\nFig. 2. The data are taken from Nordlund & Vaz (1990, table 2)\nand Hameury & Ritter (1997).\n\nby \u2212g(x).\nThose authors denote firr by x, fint by G(x) and dd ffint\nirr\n2\n\"Optically thin\" means optically thin for the outgoing radiation\nfield.

Otherwise see Fig. 1.\nSince firr can fluctuate on short timescales and the relation between fint and firr is non-linear, the effect of irradiation does not only depend on the average firr , but also on the\namplitude and period of those fluctuations. This is taken into\naccount formally by another free parameter \u03b1d \u2264 1 which addresses the duty cycle of the irradiation. For constant irradiation \u03b1d is unity. For time-varying irradiation the efficiency depends on the (time-averaged) blocked part of the intrinsic flux\nfblocked := 1 \u2212 fint which determines the heating of the convective envelope. Since fint is a convex function for typical stellar\nenvelopes as shown by Fig. 4, i.e.,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(12)\nfint a1 firr,1 + a2 firr,2 \u2264 a1 fint firr,1 + a2 fint firr,2\n\u2032\u2032\nfor any a1 , a2 > 0, a1 + a2 = 1, which is equivalent to fint\n\u2265 0,\nthe efficiency and therefore \u03b1d decreases for non-constant irradiation. Splitting a mean firr into two phases of firr,1 and firr,2 increases the resulting mean fint and thus decreases fblocked . If the\nillumination oscillates between an \"On\" state with high fluxes\n( fint \u2248 0) and an \"Off\" state with firr \u2248 0, then we get\n\n\u03b1d \u2248\nFor a plane-parallel atmosphere the external radiation field\nas a function of optical depth \u03c4 and angle of incidence \u03b2 is given\nby\n!\n\u03c4\nfirr (\u03c4, \u03b2) = firr (0, 0) cos \u03b2 exp \u2212\n,\n(11)\ncos \u03b2\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c4on\n,\n\u03c4on + \u03c4off\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c4on and \u03c4off denote the average duration of the \"On\" and\nthe \"Off\" state, respectively.

As a consequence the star is out\nof thermal equilibrium because the (unchanged) nuclear energy\nproduction Lnuc = L0 is higher than the (reduced) intrinsic luminosity Lint = (1 \u2212 s)L0 . The reaction of a star to spontaneous blocking of its intrinsic luminosity has been discussed by\nSpruit (1982) in connection with star spots: On short timescales\nthe changes of the photospheric values on the unilluminated\nsurface are negligible; on a thermal timescale of the convective\nenvelope \u03c4ce the star relaxes thermally according to the modified outer boundary conditions by adjusting R2 , T 0 , and Lnuc .\nRitter (1994); Ritter et al. (2000) give an analytical estimate\nfor the effect of irradiation on the thermal equilibrium values\nof low-mass MS stars. The effective temperature remains basically unchanged and the radius increases by about (1 \u2212 s)\u22120.1 ,\ni.e., \u2264 5% for typical values of s.\nFor our numerical computations we compute \u1e582 by solving\nthe equations of stellar structure for the donor star. This will be\ndescribed in more detail in Sect. 5.\n\n2.6. Mass transfer cycles\nFig. 6 shows schematically how the feedback between mass\ntransfer rate, irradiation, and thermal relaxation works: As soon\nas mass transfer starts, the accretion rate \u1e401 and also the accretion luminosity Laccr increase. This enhances the irradiating\nflux Firr which reduces the intrinsic luminosity Lint . Thus, the\nthermal expansion rate \u1e582 of the star is increased which in turn\nleads to an increasing mass transfer rate \u2212 \u1e402 .\nincreases\nincreases\n \u0307 2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212M\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u1e401 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Laccr\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nincreases\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyincreases\n\uf8e6\n\n\u1e582\n\nincreases\n\ntimescale \u03c4KH . But before the star reaches a new equilibrium\nstate, the expansion rate starts dropping and the mass transfer\nrate is reduced. Then the feedback works into the opposite direction: \u1e401 and Laccr decrease and so does Firr . Therefore, Lint\nincreases and the star starts to shrink. This reduces the mass\ntransfer even more. In extreme cases the mass transfer even\nstops and the system appears as a detached system until the\nnext cycle starts.\n\ndecreases\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 Lint \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 Firr\n\nFigure 6.

Since only dynamically stable systems can undergo long\nphases of mass transfer, we consider only such systems.\nThe first term in (46) reflects the adiabatic reaction of the\nstar and its Roche radius on mass loss. For dynamically stable\nsystems this term is negative and therefore it contributes to the\nstabilization of the fixed point. The third term in (46) tells how\nthermal relaxation changes with the radius of the star compared\nto its equilibrium radius. A negative value means that the larger\n(smaller) R2 , the stronger the thermal relaxation that decreases\n(increases) the radius to its (irradiation-dependend) equilibrium\nvalue.

Exactly this kind of feedback is caused by\nirradiation. The question is now whether this feedback can be\nstrong enough to overwhelm the stabilizing terms in (46).\n\n4.2. The sufficient criterion\nThe sufficient criterion for Re \u03bb1,2 < 0 is that the absolute value\nof the real part of the square root in (45) is less than the absolute\nvalue of 12 tr DF, otherwise at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part. Using (44) it can be shown that this is equivalent\nto det DF > 0 which is equivalent to\n\u03b6e \u2212 \u03b6R > 0.\n\n(50)\n\nThis is the well-known criterion for thermal stability (e.g.,\nWebbink 1985). Only thermally stable systems can have stable\nstationary solutions since thermally unstable systems transfer\nmass on a thermal timescale. As a consequence, the thermal\nrelaxation K can never reach a stationary value. Therefore, we\nconsider only systems that are thermally stable.\n\n4.4.

The other factors are of order\nunity for typical system parameters.\nFor the moment we neglect the last term of order of several\nHP\nin\ncriterion (79) as King et al. (1996) did. To get mass transR2\nfer cycles the blocking of the intrinsic flux (s\u2032 ) as a reaction\nupon an enhanced mass transfer rate must increase faster than\nthe convective envelope can relax thermally (\u03c4ce ) compared to\nthe driving time scale of the mass loss (\u03c4\u2032d ). Therefore, systems\nare the more susceptible to the onset of mass transfer cycles,\nthe smaller the timescale of the convective envelope \u03c4ce and the\nlarger the driving timescale \u03c4d \u223c \u03c4\u2032d is.\nAccordingly, main sequence stars with thin outer convec\u0001\ntion zones M2 \u223c 1 M\u2299 have been supposed to be most susceptible (King et al. 1996; Ritter et al. 2000). Also systems\ndriven by the longest possible timescale, i.e., the timescale of\nangular momentum loss by gravitational radiation, have been\nsupposed to be more susceptible than other systems. But there\nare basically no systems except, e.g., low-mass CVs in or below the period gap that are driven mainly by gravitational braking. Higher mass systems are believed to be driven mainly by\nmagnetic breaking. For a high braking rate, e.g., according to\nVerbunt & Zwaan (1981), CVs with unevolved main sequence\nstars become unsusceptible to the irradiation instability except\nfor the most massive systems because \u03c4d becomes too small in\ncomparison to \u03c4ce (Ritter et al. 1995, 1996, 2000). For giants\nmagnetic braking is believed to be ineffective and \u03c4ce is small\ncompared to \u03c4d \u2248 \u03c4nuc . Therefore, such systems and also CVs\nwith highly evolved MS stars, which have a short \u03c4ce , have been\nsupposed to be a priori more susceptible to the irradiation instability than CVs with unevolved MS stars (King et al. 1997).\nBut the last term of order of several HR2P in (79) can be neglected only if\nHP\n\u03c4ce\n\u226a\n.\nR2\n\u03c4d\n\n(85)\n\n\fAndreas B\u00fcning and Hans Ritter: Long-term evolution of compact binaries . . .\nModel No.\n\nAs soon as \u03c4ce gets small (as for main sequence stars of \u223c 1M\u2299 )\nor HR2P is no longer very small (as for giants), this term must be\ntaken into account. Obviously, the range of h firr i in which\nHP\n\u03b4\ns >\nR2\n\u2032\n\n(86)\n\ncan be fulfilled, is an interval firr,min , firr,max because s\u2032\nvanishes for h firr i \u2192 0 and h firr i \u2192 \u221e. Thus, mass transfer\ncycles can only occur in a limited range of h firr i. This range,\nthat is predicted by the analytical model, has to be checked by\nnumerical computations with full stellar models.\nIn this section we have derived a more concise and, in some\nsense, more general, expression (78), respectively (79) for the\nonset of instability than the corresponding Eq. [45], respectively [60] of King et al. (1996). We have also provided an explicit formula (84) for \u03c4\u03c4ce\u2032 which we will use in Sect. 6 to discuss\nd\nour numerical results. An important result is that the additional\nterm of several HR2P in (79) provides an upper limit for \u03c4d , i.e.,\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\na lower limit for \u2212 \u1e40 2 . Hence, for a sufficiently low secular\nmass transfer rate every system becomes stable. We will show\nin Sect. 6.1.3 that this limit can become important for CVs with\ngiant donors.\n\n5. The binary evolutionary code\nWe use the stellar evolutionary code of Schlattl et al.\n(1997); Schlattl (1999) which goes back to the code of\nKippenhahn et al. (1967). The code uses a special grid point\nalgorithm (Wagenhuber & Weiss 1994), nuclear reaction rates\nof Caughlan et al. (1985); Adelberger et al. (1998), the mixing\nlength theory of B\u00f6hm-Vitense (1958); Cox & Giuli (1968),\nthe OPAL opacities (Iglesias & Rogers 1996), and for the outer\nlayers opacities by Alexander & Ferguson (1994) and additional data from P. H. Hauschildt and J. W. Ferguson (priv.\ncomm.). In order to avoid numerical instabilities in calculating mass transfer it was necessary to implement an equation of\nstate which is smooth in the independent variables P, T , and\nchemical composition over the whole range of application. In\npractice, we use the equation of state of Saumon et al. (1995)\nwith data provided by I. Baraffe (priv. comm.), and particularly\nthe equation of state of Pols et al. (1995). Furthermore, we developed an implicit algorithm for the treatment of mass transfer similar to the method described by Benvenuto & de Vito\n(2003). For more details about our code see B\u00fcning (2003). For\ndetermining fint ( firr ) we use results given by Hameury & Ritter\n(1997) and additional data from J.-M. Hameury (priv. comm.).\n\n6. Numerical results\nTo destabilize the stationary mass transfer the ratio of \u03c4ce and\n\u03c4\u2032d has to be sufficiently small, at least less than the maximum\nof s\u2032 which is \u223c 0.1. As can be seen from (84), especially for realistic values of \u03b1\u03b7 < 1 the ratio RR12 has to be sufficiently small\nfor typical system parameters which is basically the case for\ncompact binaries only. Since the system has to be dynamically\nand thermally stable and since the donor star has to maintain\na deep convective envelope, essentially only CVs and LMXBs\nare eligible.\n\nM1 /M\u2299\n\n11\n\nq\n\n\u03b7\u0304\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03b6R\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-0.35\n\n0.3\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n5\n8\n\n2\n\n1.2\n\n5\n12\n\n0\n\n-\n\n-1.20\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n5\n8\n\n0\n\nq\n\n-0.89\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n5\n8\n\n0\n\nq\n\n-0.89\n\n0.1\n\n3\n4\n\nTable 2.

Lowmass MS stars have HR2P \u223c 10\u22124 and \u03b4 \u223c n + 5 \u2248 10. This\nleads to an almost constant contribution \u223c 10\u22123 to f while \u03c4\u03c4ce\u2032\nd\nis almost linear in h firr i. The most significant uncertainty in\nthe values of f is due to the undetermined value of \u03b1 (shortdashed vs. dash-dotted line in Fig. 9) while the influence of q\n(long-dashed vs. dash-dotted line) is negligible. Only \u03b7\u0304 (dotdash-dotted vs. dash-dotted line) has a noticable influence on\nf in this case since \u03b6s \u2212 \u03b6R is much smaller in the conservative\ncase. Systems with non-conservative mass transfer (\u03b7\u0304 < 1 and\n\u03bd = q) are systematically more stable than systems with conservative mass transfer (\u03b7\u0304 = 1). In the following discussion we\nwill restrict ourselves to \u03b7 = 1 and \u03b7\u0304 = 0 since this case is more\nrealistic than \u03b7\u0304 = 1 (Hameury et al. 1989; Prialnik & Kovetz\n1995). In general, the amplitude of the mass transfer cycles increases with the difference between s\u2032 and f for any given h firr i.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 9, CVs with unevolved donors\nare the more stable, the smaller the irradiation efficiency \u03b1 is.\nSuch systems can undergo mass transfer cycles if \u03b1 & 0.1. For,\ne.g., \u03b1 = 0.3 the \"island of instability\", which is defined by\ns\u2032 > f , ranges from h firr i \u2248 5 * 10\u22123 to h firr i \u2248 2.

Gravitational braking provides a physical\nupper limit for the driving timescale. Since the lower limit in\n1\nof the gravitational braking timescale,\n(90) is given by about 10\nwe can expect the occurrence of the irradiation instability between J \u0307 = J \u0307grav and J \u0307 \u2248 10 J \u0307grav which is roughly confirmed by\nour numerical models.\nFig. 10 shows a CV evolution for initial parameters of\nmodel no. 3 of table 2 using the point source model and an\nad hoc braking rate of J \u0307 = 5 J \u0307grav . The donor, a slightly evolved\nMS star, fills its Roche lobe at an orbital period of about 4 hr\nand starts to transfer mass undergoing cycles. At about 3.2 hr\nthe system leaves the \"island of instability\" and becomes stable. The small spike in the mass transfer rate at about 2.8 hr is\ncaused by the star becoming fully convective. For gravitational\nbraking only as shown in Fig. 11 the phase of mass transfer\ncycles does not end until the system is in the middle of the\nperiod gap. The transition, when the star becomes fully convective, coincides with a drop in the peak mass transfer rate in\nthis case.\nThe secular mass transfer rate is lower when taking irradiation into account (dotted versus solid line in Figs. 10 and 11)\nsince the irradiated star has a systematically larger radius. As\na consequence, the minimum period increases, in the case of\npure gravitational braking by up to 2 minutes, depending on\n\u03b1. This is of the same order as the correction which is caused\nby geometrical distortion of the mass losing star by the Roche\npotential (Renvoiz\u00e9 et al. 2002), and this is still not sufficient\nto explain the observed orbital minimum period of \u223c 78 min\n(Ritter & Kolb 2003) if only gravitational braking is taken into\naccount.\nFig. 12 shows the phase of mass transfer cycles as function\nof time for the same system as in Fig. 10.

The\nduration of the high state decreases with decreasing \u03b1 until the\nmass transfer rate becomes sinusoidal with a frequency \u03c9 as\ngiven in (91). For even weaker feedback the oscillations are\ndamped or even vanish completely.\n\ncounting for evolved low-mass donors in CVs is prior thermal\ntimescale mass transfer from an evolved, initially more massive star. In this case the mass losing star is more massive to\nsuch an extent that the system is initially thermally unstable\n(\u03b6e \u2212\u03b6R < 0) and the mass transfer occurs on a thermal timescale\n(Kolb et al. 2000; Schenker et al. 2002).\nAlthough the bipolytrope model is formally valid only for\nchemically homogeneous stars we tentatively apply it also to\nchemically evolved donor stars. As an example fig. 15 shows s\u2032\nand f for an 0.45 M\u2299 remnant of thermal timescale mass transfer with a central hydrogen abundance of Xc = 0.05. It is the\ncore of an initially more massive MS star of 1.6 M\u2299 . According\n1\nof \u03c4ce of an unevolved MS star of the\nto (66) \u03c4ce is less than 10\nsame mass, and its radius is larger by \u223c 70%. Due to its deeper\nsuperadiabatic convection zone the maximum of s\u2032 is shifted\nto higher values of h firr i and due to its larger radius f is also\nshifted to larger values of h firr i, but in total the difference to\nthe case with an unevolved donor discussed before is comparatively small. As can be seen from fig. 15, this particular system\nshould be stable for \u03b1 = 0.1 but can undergo cycles for \u03b1 = 0.3.\nWhen going to smaller donor masses or lower braking rates\nduring the initial evolution also remnants of thermal timescale\nmass transfer can become unstable for \u03b1 & 0.1 as CVs with\nunevolved donors do. It seems that CVs with an evolved donor\nare not more susceptible to mass transfer cycles than CVs with\nunevolved donors (if at all, it is the other way around). Rather\nthey are susceptible at a shorter driving timescale \u03c4d .\nAs for unevolved CVs it is also possible to determine the\nrange of \u03c4d where mass transfer cycles should occur, e.g., if\n\u03b1 = 0.3:\n\n6.1.2.

The onset of mass transfer cycles occurs at\nM1 \u2248 0.91 M\u2299 and M2 \u2248 0.26 M\u2299.\n\nfig. 16 shows6 that this is not the case, when the donor star\nreaches M2 = 0.45 M\u2299 at an orbital period of \u223c 8 hr. Instead,\nthe system becomes unstable at a donor mass much lower than\nexpected, i.e., at about 0.26 M\u2299. The reason for this discrepancy is probably that the bipolytrope model underestimates the\ntimescale \u03c4ce on which the stellar radius changes if irradiation\nis changed. Numerical computations indicate that \u03c4ce from (66)\nis too large by a factor of \u223c 1.4 for a fully convective 0.3 M\u2299\nMS star whereas it is too small by \u223c 1.6 for an 0.5 M\u2299 MS\nstar and even more so for more massive or more evolved stars.\nAs a result evolved systems are significantly more stable than\npreviously expected.\n\nfor \u03b1 = 0.3 the \"island of instability\" ranges from 0.25 to 20 in\nh firr i.

Second, the depth of the superadiabatic\nconvection zone grows during giant evolution which shifts the\n\"island of instability\" to higher h firr i. Hence, more evolved giants are less affected by irradiation. Third, more evolved giants\nhave a larger scale height HR2P so that their \"island of instability\"\nis smaller than for less evolved giants.\n\ns', f\n\n<firr>\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n10-3\n\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFigure 18. s\u2032 for an LMXB with an unevolved 0.8 M\u2299 MS star\n(no. 3 of table 1) and an initially 1.4 M\u2299 NS for the point source\nand the constant flux model (solid and dotted line). s\u2032 is compared to f for \u03b7\u0304 = 1 and \u03b1 = 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 (short-dashed,\ndash-dotted, and dot-dash-dotted line, respectively).\n\n100\n\n10-1\n\ns', f\n\nAs we have discussed in the last section, CVs might undergo\nmass transfer cycles for 0.1 . \u03b1 . 1 given a suitable driving\ntimscale. Another class of compact binary systems with thermally stable mass transfer, i.e., small q, are LMXBs. In the following we consider only LMXBs with neutron star primaries.\nIn principle, the discussion for these system is analogous to the\ndiscussion of CVs. While the radius of a white dwarf is about\n10\u22122 R\u2299 , the radius of a neutron star is only about 10 km. Since\nfor a given secondary star and driving mechanism h firr i \u223c R\u03b11\n(cf. Eq. (84)) the smaller radius of a neutron star has to be compensated by a correspondingly small value of \u03b1 for achieving\na comparable value of h firr i. Because an efficiency that small\nis unlikely, King et al. (1996, 1997); Ritter et al. (2000) have\nconcluded that irradiation in LMXBs is too strong to destabilize such systems.\nHowever, this conclusion applies only to the constant flux\nmodel but not to the point source model. For the point source\nmodel s\u2032 decreases much more slowly for large h firr i than for\nthe constant flux model because the surface elements near the\nterminator are only partially blocked by irradiation, even for\nvery high fluxes due to the high angle of incidence.

Since the bipolytrope model underestimates \u03c4ce by a factor of \u223c 2, the system undergoes cycles only\nfor braking rates up to 5 J \u0307grav . Only low-amplitude sinusoidal\noscillations occur for \u03b1 = 0.1 while for \u03b1 = 10\u22122 the system is\ndeep in the unstable region as the evolution in fig. 21 demonstrates.\n\n(101)\n\nWith \u03c4ce \u2248 5 * 105 yr the driving timescale \u03c4d must be between\n2 * 108 yr and 1012 yr so that the system should be near the\nboundary of the unstable region.

General outline of mass transfer cycles and\nobservational implications\nThe appearance of mass transfer cycles differs between different types of systems. \"Ideal\" outbursts as outlined by\nKing et al. (1997) require a very short ratio of \u03c4ce and \u03c4\u2032d which\nis typical for giants. They are characterised by a very short high\nstate at a rather high mass transfer rate followed by a long lasting low state as shown by fig. 24.\nIn the limit of weak irradiation feedback, as it is typically\nthe case for CVs with 0.1 . \u03b1 . 1 and weak braking, a system\nleaves the high state long before saturation is reached. Only a\nfew 10\u22123 of the stellar mass is transferred during a cycle and\nthe recurrence timescale is rather short. In the limit of strong\nirradiation feedback, as it is often the case for LMXBs with\n10\u22122 . \u03b1 . 0.1, the system stays in the high state until saturation has been almost exactly reached. As a consequence of this,\n\n17\n\nthe mass transfer rate decreases to almost the stationary value\nbefore the system enters the low state. The duration of the high\nand low state are of the same order, and in the high state the\nsystem transfers mass just slightly above the stationary mass\ntransfer rate for most of the time.\nSince the timescale of mass transfer cycles, i.e., the thermal timescale of the convective envelope of the donor is by far\nlonger than typical observational timescales (at most of order\nof centuries), it is effectively not possible to observe the evolution of a single system from the high into the low state, or\nvice versa. Nevertheless, the occurrence of these cycles would\naffect the observable properties of a binary population. First,\nsystems in the low state are more difficult to observe than in\nthe bright high state or may even appear as detached systems\nif mass transfer ceases completely in the low state. If the duration of the low state is longer than that of the high state, then\nmost of the population can be basically unobservable. Second,\neven in the high state the mass transfer does not proceed at a\nconstant rate but declines continuously from the peak rate until\nthe system \"switches\" into the low state. Hence, even a completely homogeneous sample can show significant variations in\nthe mass transfer rate. Third, the mean mass transfer rate of the\nobservable systems in the high state can be significantly larger\nthan the secular mass transfer rate which can lead to apparent\ndiscrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions\nif the occurrence of mass transfer cycles is not taken into account.\nTherefore, mass transfer cycles could provide an explanation for, e.g., the scatter of mass transfer rates of novalike CVs\nabove the period gap, the disappearance of bright systems at\nthe upper edge of the period gap, or discrepancies between predicted and observed luminosities and birthrates of LMXBs as\nrecently suggested by Pfahl et al. (2003).\n\n6.4. Non-local effects\nWe have assumed that irradiation is a local effect and can be\ntreated for every surface element of the donor separately. If\nthe contribution of non-local effects (e.g., circulations) to the\nlateral heat transport becomes non-negligible for sufficiently\nstrong irradiation, or if there is another mechanism which heats\nthe unilluminated side (e.g., scattering of X-rays by an extended X-ray corona), then also the effective temperature and\nthe intrinsic flux on the unilluminated surface depends on h firr i\nand differs from T 0 and F0 , respectively.\nObservations of the eclipsing binary AA Dor show that\neven in the case of very strong irradiation an illuminated star\ncan preserve a cool hemisphere with \u223c 2 000 K while the illuminated side is heated up to \u223c 20 000 K (Hilditch et al. 2003).\nTherefore, it seems plausible that also in the case of LMXBs\nat most a small fraction of the irradiating flux is transported\nto the unilluminated side. Nevertheless, for sufficiently strong\nirradiation, e.g., h firr i \u223c 104 , even a small fraction can have\na significant effect onto the unilluminated side. We note that\nwith the general definition of s in (18) our analytical ansatz remains valid, even if the unilluminated side is heated up, and\nwe formally get the same stability criterion. In this case the\n\n\f18\n\nAndreas B\u00fcning and Hans Ritter: Long-term evolution of compact binaries . . .\n\nshape of s\u2032 depends on the exact prescription of those nonlocal effects. Here we can not make any quantitative predictions. Nevertheless, it is plausible that s\u2032 becomes greater at\nhigher fluxes h firr i if non-local effects are taken into account.\nThis would mean that our local treatment of irradiation provides a lower limit on the occurrence of mass transfer cycles in\nLMXBs. An upper limit is given by the fact that the area below\nthe s\u2032 curve has to be less than the maximum fraction of the\nsurface which is affected by irradiation, i.e., less than unity.\n\n7. Summary and Conclusion\nWe have described the physics of irradiation driven mass transfer cycles by a two-dimensional system of ordinary differential\nequations similar to King et al. (1996). An additional term of\norder of several times HR2P which reflects the usual thermal relaxation of the mass losing star, can not be neglected, because\nit provides an upper limit for the driving timescale \u03c4d , respectively a lower limit for the timescale ratio \u03c4\u03c4ce\u2032 , where mass transd\nfer cycles can occur. Taking into account this term and also the\nrather large pressure scale height and the deep superadiabatic\nconvection zone of giants we have concluded that CVs with giants above a certain core mass can not undergo mass transfer\ncycles unless the efficiency parameter \u03b1 is unexpectedly large.\nOn the other hand LMXBs with giants might be susceptible to\nthe irradiation instability as it has been predicted by King et al.\n(1997).\nWe agree with results of King et al. (1996); Ritter et al.\n(2000) regarding CVs with unevolved MS stars: For high braking rates (e.g., Verbunt & Zwaan 1981), as they are also required by the period gap model (e.g., Spruit & Ritter 1983;\nKolb 1993), such systems are stable except for the most\n\u0001\nmassive \u223c 1 M\u2299 donor stars. On the other hand, for low\nbraking rates, as they are proposed by Sills et al. (2000);\nAndronov et al. (2003), CVs above the period gap might undergo cycles. In this case only novalikes are affected since\ndwarf novae have rather large amplitude outbursts with a rather\nsmall duty cycle and therefore a small \u03b1d . Even for gravitational braking the susceptability to irradiation ceases within the\nperiod gap so that CVs with unevolved MS stars below the period gap are stable.\nNumerical evolutionary computations have shown that the\nuncritical application of the predictions of the analytical model\nto highly evolved remnants of thermal timescale mass transfer does not yield good quantitative estimates for the boundaries of the unstable region. The timescale on which the stellar\nradius changes, if irradiation is changed, seems to be significantly underestimated by the bipolytrope model so that such\nsystems are more stable at high braking rates than previously\nexpected. The most evolved systems are susceptible to irradiation for 0.1 . \u03b1 . 1 and orbital periods roughly between 2 and\n5 hours, or donor masses between 0.1 and 0.3 M\u2299 , respectively.\nFor giants the ratio of thermal energy of the envelope divided\nby the stellar luminosity seems to give a good estimate for \u03c4ce .\nSince in the point source model surface elements near the\nterminator are irradiated at a high angle of incidence, they are\nonly partially blocked by irradiation even for high fluxes. Thus,\nother than expected by King et al. (1996, 1997); Ritter et al.\n\n(2000) also LMXBs with unevolved or evolved MS stars might\nbe susceptible to the irradiation instability. Regarding the driving timescale for such systems basically the same restrictions\napply as for CVs. LMXBs can undergo mass transfer cycles\nonly for \u03b1 . 0.1. The contribution of non-local effects of irradiation, e.g., circulations, which were not taken into account by\nour model, might be non-negligible for LMXBs. It seems plausible that this effect tendentially destabilizes the mass transfer.\nHowever, it is not clear in all cases whether mass transfer in\nLMXBs is driven by Roche lobe overflow or by irradiationinduced winds (Basko & Sunyaev 1973; Basko et al. 1977;\nIben Jr. et al. 1997). In the latter case our model could obviously not be applied to these systems.\nWe conclude that the analytical model gives a qualitatively\nand also quantitatively suitable description for the onset of\nmass transfer cycles except for highly evolved remnants of thermal timescale mass transfer. We think that the boundaries of the\nunstable regions can be determined with an accuracy of a factor\nof . 2.\nTo answer the final question whether the observable CV\nor LMXB population or parts of it is undergoing mass transfer cycles we need to know two basic parameters: the driving\ntimescale, respectively the magnetic braking law, and the efficiency \u03b1. Nevertheless, we have shown that irradiation-driven\nmass transfer cycles in compact binaries are possible for not\nunreasonable values of \u03b1 and \u03c4d .\nAcknowledgements. We thank A.
